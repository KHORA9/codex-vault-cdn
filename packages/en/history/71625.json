BANCROFT & COMPANY, PUBLISHERS.\r\n     1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Entered according to Act of Congress in the Year 1883, by\r\n     HUBERT H. BANCROFT,\r\n     In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.\r\n\r\n     All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the third greatest of the world’s republics, wherein society and\r\ncivilization are displayed under somewhat abnormal aspects, under\r\naspects at least widely different from those present in other than\r\nSpanish-speaking communities, configurations and climates, races\r\nand race intermixtures, civil and religious polities, and the whole\r\nrange of mental and physical environment being in so many respects\r\nexceptional and individual, Mexico presents a study one of the most\r\ninteresting and profitable of any among the nations of to-day.\r\n\r\nA brilliant though unjust and merciless conquest was followed by the\r\nenforcement of Spain’s institutions upon the survivors, who were\r\nthemselves so far advanced in arts, industries, and intellectual\r\nculture as to render such metamorphosis most disastrous. After the\r\nawful success of Cortés, Spain neither exterminated the natives, like\r\nthe United States, nor left them in their aboriginal independence,\r\nlike the fur-magnates of British America. Aiming at the utmost\r\nkindness, the Spanish government fastened on body and soul the iron\r\nfetters of tyranny and superstition; aiming at liberty and humanity,\r\nslavery and wrong were permitted. With grants of land, grants of men\r\nand women were made. The church fought valiantly against the evils\r\nof the encomienda system, and against the cruelty and injustice\r\nimposed by the colonists upon the natives. There was here little of\r\nthat wholesome indifference to the welfare of her colonies later\r\nmanifested by England with regard to her settlements in America.\r\nSpain’s American possessions belonged not to the Spanish people but to\r\nthe Spanish sovereign; the lands and the people were the king’s, to be\r\nheld or disposed of as he should direct. Hence among the people were\r\nencouraged dividing castes; commerce was placed under the severest\r\nrestrictions, and in many ways it became clear that provinces were\r\nheld and governed almost exclusively for the benefit of the crown.\r\nAnd so they remained, Europeans and Americans intermingling their\r\nloves and hates for three hundred years, which was indeed Mexico’s\r\ndark age, two civilizations being well nigh crushed therein. Light\r\nat last breaking in upon the people, the three centuries of viceregal\r\nrule were brought to a close by their taking a stand for independence,\r\nsuch as their Anglo-American neighbor had so recently achieved. And\r\nnow during these latter days of swift progression Mexico is happily\r\naroused from her lethargy, and is taking her proper place among the\r\nenlightened nations of the earth, to the heart-felt joy of all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first of the five great periods of Mexican history, embracing the\r\naboriginal annals of Anáhuac, has been exhaustively treated in the\r\nfifth volume of my _Native Races_. The second is that of the conquest\r\nby Cortés; the third covers nearly three centuries of viceregal rule\r\nin New Spain; the fourth comprises the struggle for independence\r\nand the founding of the republic; and the fifth extends thence to\r\nthe present time, including as salient features a series of internal\r\nrevolutions, the war with the United States, the imperial experiment\r\nof Maximilian, and the peaceful development of national industries\r\nand power in recent years. It is my purpose to present on a national\r\nscale, and in a space symmetrically proportioned to the importance\r\nof each, the record of the four successive periods.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Mexico, filling the present and part of another\r\nvolume, has been treated by many writers, and in a masterly manner.\r\nIn the three periods of Mexican history following the conquest there\r\nis no comprehensive work extant in English; nor is there any such\r\nwork in Spanish that if translated would prove entirely satisfactory\r\nto English readers. Of the few Spanish and Mexican writers whose\r\nresearches have extended over the whole field, or large portions of\r\nit, none have been conspicuously successful in freeing themselves from\r\nthe quicksands of race prejudice, of religious feeling, of patriotic\r\nimpulse, of political partisanship; none have had a satisfactory\r\ncommand of existing authorities; none in the matter of space have\r\nmade a symmetrical division of the periods, or have appreciated the\r\nrelative importance of different topics as they appear to any but\r\nSpanish eyes. Yet there has been no lack among these writers of careful\r\ninvestigation or brilliant diction. Indeed there is hardly an epoch\r\nthat has not been ably treated from various partisan standpoints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe list of authorities prefixed to this volume shows approximately\r\nmy resources for writing a HISTORY OF MEXICO. I may add that no part\r\nof my collection is more satisfactorily complete than that pertaining\r\nto Mexico. I have all the standard histories and printed chronicles\r\nof the earliest times, together with all the works of writers who\r\nhave extended their investigations to the events and developments\r\nof later years. On the shelves of my Library are found the various\r\n_Colecciones de Documentos_, filled with precious historical papers\r\nfrom the Spanish and Mexican archives, all that were consulted in\r\nmanuscript by Robertson, Prescott, and other able writers, with\r\nthousands equally important that were unknown to them. My store of\r\nmanuscript material is rich both in originals and copies, including\r\nthe treasures secured during a long experience by such collectors as\r\nJosé María Andrade and José Fernando Ramirez; a copy of the famous\r\n_Archivo General de Mexico_, in thirty-two volumes; the autograph\r\noriginals of Cárlos María Bustamante’s historical writings, in about\r\nfifty volumes, containing much not found in his printed works; the\r\noriginal records of the earliest Mexican councils of the church, with\r\nmany ecclesiastical and missionary chronicles not extant in print;\r\nand finally a large amount of copied material on special topics drawn\r\nfrom different archives expressly for my work.\r\n\r\nDocuments printed by the Mexican government, including the regular\r\n_memorias_ and other reports of different departments and officials,\r\nconstitute a most valuable source of information. Partisan writings\r\nand political pamphlets are a noticeable feature of Mexican historical\r\nliterature, indispensable to the historian who would study both\r\nsides of every question. Prominent Mexicans have formed collections\r\nof such works, a dozen of which I have united in one, making two\r\nhundred and eighteen volumes of _Papeles Varios_, some five thousand\r\npamphlets, besides nearly as many more collected by my own efforts.\r\nThe newspapers of a country cannot be disregarded, and my collection\r\nis not deficient in this class of data, being particularly rich in\r\nofficial periodicals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Mexico, which begins this history, has the peculiar\r\nattractions of forming the grandest episode in early American annals\r\nfrom a military point of view, and in opening to the world the richest,\r\nmost populous, and most civilized country on the northern continent,\r\nand of gradually incorporating it in the sisterhood of nations as the\r\nforemost representative of Latin-American states. On the other hand,\r\nan episode which presents but a continuation of the bloody path which\r\nmarked the advance of the conquerors in America, and which involved\r\nthe destruction not only of thousands of unoffending peoples but\r\nof a most fair and hopeful culture, is not in its results the most\r\npleasing of pictures. But neither in this pit of Acheron nor in that\r\ngarden of Hesperides may we expect to discover the full significance\r\nof omnipotent intention. From the perpetual snow-cap springs the\r\nimperceptibly moving glacier. A grain of sand gives no conception\r\nof the earth, nor a drop of water of the sea, nor the soft breathing\r\nof an infant of a hurricane; yet worlds are made of atoms, and seas\r\nof drops of water, and storms of angry air-breaths. Though modern\r\nMexico can boast a century more of history than the northern nations\r\nof America, as compared with the illimitable future her past is but\r\na point of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF THIS VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     VOYAGE OF HERNANDEZ DE CÓRDOBA TO YUCATAN.\r\n     1516-1517.\r\n\r\n                                                                 PAGE.\r\n\r\n     A Glance at the State of European Discovery and Government\r\n     in America at the Opening of this Volume—Diego Velazquez\r\n     in Cuba—Character of the Man—A Band of Adventurers Arrives\r\n     from Darien—The Governor Counsels them to Embark in\r\n     Slave-catching—Under Hernandez de Córdoba they Sail Westward\r\n     and Discover Yucatan—And are Filled with Astonishment\r\n     at the Large Towns and Stone Towers they See there—They\r\n     Fight the Natives at Cape Catoche—Skirt the Peninsula to\r\n     Champoton—Sanguinary Battle—Return to Cuba—Death of Córdoba     1\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     JUAN DE GRIJALVA EXPLORES THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE MEXICAN\r\n     GULF.\r\n     1518.\r\n\r\n     Velazquez Plans a New Expedition—Gives the Command to\r\n     his Nephew, Juan de Grijalva—Who Embarks at Santiago and\r\n     Strikes the Continent at Cozumel Island—Coasts Southward to\r\n     Ascension Bay—Then Turns and Doubles Cape Catoche—Naming\r\n     of New Spain—Fight at Champoton—Arrival at Laguna de\r\n     Términos—Alaminos, the Pilot, is Satisfied that Yucatan is\r\n     an Island—They Coast Westward and Discover the Rivers San\r\n     Pedro y San Pablo and Tabasco—Notable Interview at this\r\n     Place between the Europeans and the Americans—The Culhua\r\n     Country—They Pass La Rambla, Tonalá, the Rio Goazacoalco,\r\n     the Mountain of San Martin, the Rivers of Alvarado and\r\n     Banderas, and Come to the Islands of Sacrificios and San\r\n     Juan de Ulua                                                   15\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     RETURN OF GRIJALVA.

MEXICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is my custom to prefix to each work of the series the name\r\nof every authority cited in its pages. In this instance, however,\r\nit is impracticable. So immense is my material for the_ HISTORY OF\r\nMEXICO _that a full list of the authorities would fill a third of a\r\nvolume, obviously more space than can properly be allowed even for so\r\nimportant a feature. I therefore reduce the list by omitting, for the\r\nmost part, three large classes: first, those already given for_ CENTRAL\r\nAMERICA; _second, those to be given in the_ NORTH MEXICAN STATES;\r\n_and third, many works, mostly pamphlets, which, though consulted and\r\noften important, have only an indirect bearing on history, or which\r\nhave been cited perhaps but once, and on some special topic.

The Cabots from England and the Cortereals from Portugal made\r\nvoyages to Newfoundland and down the east coast of North America;\r\nAmerigo Vespucci sailed hither and thither in the service of Spain,\r\nand wrote letters confounding knowledge; Vasco da Gama doubled the Cape\r\nof Good Hope; Columbus, Ojeda, Niño, Guerra, Bastidas, and Pinzon and\r\nSolis coasted the Tierra Firme of Central and South America; Ocampo\r\nskirted Cuba and found it an island; Cabral accidentally discovered\r\nBrazil; Juan Ponce de Leon hunted for the Fountain of Youth in Florida;\r\nVasco Nuñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus and floated his ships on\r\nthe South Sea. Prior to 1517 almost every province of the eastern\r\ncontinental seaboard, from Labrador to Patagonia, had been uncovered,\r\nsave those of the Mexican Gulf, which casketed wonders greater than\r\nthem all. This little niche alone remained wrapped in aboriginal\r\nobscurity, although less than forty leagues of strait separated the\r\nproximate points of Cuba and Yucatan.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the government of these Western Indies, Columbus, first\r\nadmiral of the Ocean Sea, had been succeeded by Bobadilla, Ovando,\r\nand the son and heir of the discoverer, Diego Colon, each managing,\r\nwherein it was possible, worse than his predecessor; so that it was\r\nfound necessary to establish at Santo Domingo, the capital city of\r\nthe Indies, a sovereign tribunal, to which appeals might be made from\r\nany viceroy, governor, or other representative of royalty, and which\r\nshould eventually, as a royal audiencia, exercise for a time executive\r\nas well as judicial supremacy. But before clothing this tribunal with\r\nfull administrative powers, Cardinal Jimenez, then dominant in New\r\nWorld affairs, had determined to try upon the turbulent colonists\r\nthe effect of ecclesiastical influence in secular matters, and had\r\nsent over three friars of the order of St Jerome, Luis de Figueroa,\r\nAlonso de Santo Domingo, and Bernardo de Manzanedo, to whose direction\r\ngovernors and all others were made subject. Just before the period\r\nin our history at which this volume opens, the Jeronimite Fathers,\r\nas the three friars were called, had practically superseded Diego\r\nColon at Española, and were supervising Pedrarias Dávila of Castilla\r\ndel Oro, Francisco de Garay governor of Jamaica, and Diego Velazquez\r\ngovernor of Cuba. It will be remembered that Diego Colon had sent Juan\r\nde Esquivel in 1509 to Jamaica, where he was succeeded by Francisco\r\nde Garay; and Diego Velazquez had been sent in 1511 to Cuba to subdue\r\nand govern that isle, subject to the young admiral’s dictation; and\r\nbeside these, a small establishment at Puerto Rico, and Pedrarias on\r\nthe Isthmus, there was no European ruler in the regions, islands or\r\nfirm land, between the two main continents of America.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the _religiosos_ showed little improvement on\r\nthe governments of their predecessors, who, while professing less\r\nhonesty and piety, practised more worldly wisdom; hence within two\r\nshort years the friars were recalled by Fonseca, who, on the death of\r\nJimenez, had again come into power in Spain, and the administration\r\nof affairs in the Indies remained wholly with the audiencia of Santo\r\nDomingo, the heirs of Columbus continuing to agitate their claim\r\nthroughout the century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was as the lieutenant of Diego Colon that Velazquez had been sent\r\nto conquer Cuba; but that easy work accomplished, he repudiated his\r\nformer master, and reported directly to the crown.\r\n\r\nVelazquez was an hidalgo, native of Cuéllar, who, after seventeen\r\nyears of service in the wars of Spain, had come over with the old\r\nadmiral in his second voyage, in 1493, and was now a man of age,\r\nexperience, and wealth. With a commanding figure, spacious forehead,\r\nfair complexion, large clear eyes, well-chiselled nose and mouth,\r\nand a narrow full-bearded chin, the whole lighted by a pleasing\r\nintellectual expression, he presented, when elegantly attired as\r\nwas his custom, as imposing a presence as any man in all the Indies.\r\nIn history he also formed quite a figure. And yet there was nothing\r\nweighty in his character. He was remarkable rather for the absence\r\nof positive qualities; he could not lay claim even to conspicuous\r\ncruelty. He was not a bad man as times went; assuredly he was not a\r\ngood man as times go. He could justly lay claim to all the current\r\nvices, but none of them were enormous enough to be interesting. In\r\ntemper he was naturally mild and affable, yet suspicious and jealous,\r\nand withal easily influenced; so that when roused to anger, as was\r\nfrequently the case, he was beside himself.\r\n\r\nChief assistant in his new pacification was Pánfilo de Narvaez, who\r\nbrought from Jamaica thirty archers, and engaged in the customary\r\nbutchering, while the governor, with three hundred men, quietly\r\nproceeded to found towns and settlements, such as Trinidad, Puerto\r\ndel Príncipe, Matanzas, Santi Espíritu, San Salvador, Habana, and\r\nSantiago, making the seat of his government at the place last named,\r\nand appointing alcaldes in the several settlements. Other notable\r\ncharacters were likewise in attendance on this occasion, namely,\r\nBartolomé de las Casas, Francisco Hernandez de Córdoba, Juan de\r\nGrijalva, and Hernan Cortés.\r\n\r\nDiscreet in his business, and burdened by no counteracting scruples,\r\nVelazquez and those who were with him prospered. Informed of this,\r\nabove one hundred of the starving colonists at Darien obtained\r\npermission from Pedrarias in 1516 to pass over to Cuba, and were\r\naffably received by the governor. Most of them were well-born and\r\npossessed of means; for though provisions were scarce at Antigua,\r\nthe South Sea expeditions of Vasco Nuñez, Badajoz, and Espinosa, had\r\nmade gold plentiful there. Among this company was Bernal Diaz del\r\nCastillo, a soldier of fortune, who had come from Spain to Tierra\r\nFirme in 1514, and who now engages in the several expeditions to\r\nMexico, and becomes, some years later, one of the chief historians\r\nof the conquest.\r\n\r\nReady for any exploit, and having failed to receive certain\r\nrepartimientos promised them, the band from Tierra Firme cast glances\r\ntoward the unknown west. The lesser isles had been almost depopulated\r\nby the slave-catchers, and from the shores of the adjoining mainland\r\nthe affrighted natives had fled to the interior. It was still a\r\nprofitable employment, however, for the colonists must have laborers,\r\nbeing themselves entirely opposed to work. The governor of Cuba,\r\nparticularly, was fond of the traffic, for it was safe and lucrative.\r\nThough a representative of royal authority in America, he was as\r\nready as any irresponsible adventurer to break the royal command.\r\nDuring this same year of 1516, a vessel from Santiago had loaded\r\nwith natives and provisions at the Guanaja Islands, and had returned\r\nto port. While the captain and crew were ashore for a carouse, the\r\ncaptives burst open the hatches, overpowered the nine men who had\r\nbeen left on guard, and sailed away midst the frantic gesticulations\r\nof the captain on shore. Reaching their islands in safety, they there\r\nencountered a brigantine with twenty-five Spaniards lying in wait for\r\ncaptives. Attacking them boldly, the savages drove them off toward\r\nDarien, and then burned the ship in which they themselves had made\r\ntheir enforced voyage to Cuba.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course this atrocious conduct on the part of the\r\nsavages demanded exemplary punishment. To this end two vessels were\r\nimmediately despatched with soldiers who fell upon the inhabitants\r\nof Guanaja, put many to the sword, and carried away five hundred\r\ncaptives, beside securing gold to the value of twenty thousand pesos\r\nde oro.\r\n\r\nHappy in the thought of engaging in an occupation so profitable, the\r\nchivalrous one hundred cheerfully adventured their Darien gold in a\r\nsimilar voyage, fitting out two vessels for the purpose, and choosing\r\nfor their commander Francisco Hernandez de Córdoba, now a wealthy\r\nplanter of Santi Espíritu.[1] Velazquez added a third vessel, a\r\nsmall bark, in consideration of a share in the speculation.[2] After\r\nlaying in a supply of cassava, a bread made from the yucca root, and\r\nsome salt beef, bacon, and glass beads for barter, the expedition\r\ndeparted from Santiago de Cuba, and went round to the north side\r\nof the island. There were in all one hundred and ten[3] soldiers,\r\nwith Antonio de Alaminos as chief pilot, Alonso Gonzalez priest, and\r\nBernardino Iñiguez king’s treasurer. Here the chief pilot said to the\r\ncommander, “Down from Cuba Island, in this sea of the west, my heart\r\ntells me there must be rich lands; because, when I sailed as a boy\r\nwith the old admiral, I remember he inclined this way.” Suddenly the\r\nvision of Córdoba enlarged. Here might be something better, nobler,\r\nmore profitable even than kidnapping the poor natives. Despatching a\r\nmessenger to Velazquez, Córdoba asked, in case new discoveries were\r\nmade while on the way to catch Indians, for permission to act as\r\nthe governor’s lieutenant in such lands. The desired authority was\r\ngranted, and from the haciendas near by were brought on board sheep,\r\npigs, and mares, so that stock-raising might begin if settlements\r\nwere formed.\r\n\r\nSailing from the Habana, or San Cristóbal, the 8th of February,\r\n1517, they came to Cape San Antonio, whence, on the 12th, they struck\r\nwestward, and after certain days,[4] during two of which they were\r\nseverely tempest-tossed, they discovered land;[5] first the point of\r\nan island, where were some fine salt-fields, and cultivated ground.\r\nThe people who appeared on the shore were not naked as on the Islands,\r\nbut well dressed in white and colored cotton, some with ornaments\r\nof gold, silver, and feathers. The men were bold and brave, and the\r\nwomen well-formed and modest, with head and breast covered. Most\r\nwonderful of all, however, were some great towers, built of stone and\r\nlime, with steps leading to the top; and chapels covered with wood\r\nand straw, within which were found arranged, in artistic order, many\r\nidols apparently representing women, and that led the Spaniards to\r\nname the place De Las Mugeres.[6] Proceeding northward, they came to\r\na larger point, of island or mainland; and presently they descried,\r\ntwo leagues from the shore, a large town, which was called El Gran\r\nCairo.\r\n\r\nWhile looking for an anchorage, on the morning of the 4th of March,\r\nfive canoes approached the commander’s vessel, and thirty men stepped\r\nfearlessly on board. The canoes were large, some of them capable of\r\nholding fifty persons; the men were intelligent, and wore a sleeveless\r\ncloak and apron of cotton.[7] The Spaniards gave them bacon and bread\r\nto eat, and to each a necklace of green glass beads. After closely\r\nscrutinizing the ship and its belongings, the natives put off for the\r\nshore. Early next day appeared the cacique with many men in twelve\r\ncanoes, making signs of friendship, and crying, _Conex cotoch!_ that\r\nis to say, Come to our houses; whence the place was called Punta de\r\nCatoche,[8] which name it bears to-day.\r\n\r\nThus invited, Córdoba, with several of his officers, and twenty-five\r\nsoldiers armed with cross-bows and firelocks, accompanied the natives\r\nto the shore, where the cacique with earnest invitations to visit\r\nhis town managed to lead them into ambush. The natives fought with\r\nflint-edged wooden swords, lances, bows, and slings, and were protected\r\nby armors of quilted cotton and shields, their faces being painted\r\nand their heads plumed. They charged the enemy bravely, amidst shouts\r\nand noise of instruments; several of the Spaniards were wounded,\r\ntwo fatally. At length the natives gave way before the sharp and\r\nsulphurous enginery of their exceedingly strange visitants, leaving\r\nfifteen of their number dead upon the ground. Two youths were taken\r\nprisoners, who were afterward baptized and named Julian and Melchor,\r\nand profitably employed by the Spaniards as interpreters. Near the\r\nbattle-ground stood three more of those curious stone temples, one\r\nof which was entered by Father Gonzalez during the fight, and the\r\nearthen and wooden idols and ornaments and plates of inferior gold\r\nfound there were carried away to the ship.\r\n\r\nEmbarking, and proceeding westward, the Spaniards arrived a fortnight\r\nlater at Campeche,[9] where their amazement was increased on beholding\r\nthe number and beauty of the edifices, while the blood and other\r\nevidences of human sacrifice discovered about the altars of the\r\ntemples filled their souls with horror. And as they were viewing\r\nthese monuments of a superior culture, the troops of armed natives\r\nincreased, and the priests of the temples, producing a bundle of\r\nreeds, set fire to it, signifying to the visitors that unless they\r\ntook their departure before the reeds were consumed every one of them\r\nwould be killed. Remembering their wounds at Catoche, the Spaniards\r\ntook the hint and departed.\r\n\r\nThey were soon caught in a storm and severely shaken; after which\r\nthey began to look about for water, which had by this time become\r\nas precious to them as the Tyrian mures tincture, of which each\r\nshell-fish gave but a single drop. They accordingly came to anchor\r\nnear a village called Potonchan, but owing to a sanguinary battle\r\nin which they were driven back, Córdoba named the place Bahía de\r\nMala Pelea.[10] In this engagement the natives did not shrink from\r\nfighting hand to hand with the foe. Fifty-seven Spaniards were killed\r\non the spot, two were carried off alive, and five died subsequently\r\non shipboard. Those whom the natives could not kill they followed\r\nto the shore, in their disappointed rage, wading out into the sea\r\nafter them, like the bloodthirsty Cyclops who pursued the Trojan\r\nÆneas and his crew. But one man escaped unharmed, and he of all the\r\nrest was selected for slaughter by the natives of Florida. Córdoba\r\nreceived twelve wounds; Bernal Diaz three. The survivors underwent\r\nmuch suffering before reaching Cuba, for the continued hostilities\r\nof the natives prevented their obtaining the needful supply of water.\r\n\r\nThere being no one else to curse except themselves, they cursed the\r\npilot, Alaminos, for his discovery, and for still persisting in calling\r\nthe country an island. Then they left Mala Pelea Bay and returned\r\nalong the coast, north-eastwardly, for three days, when they entered\r\nan opening in the shore to which they gave the name of Estero de los\r\nLagartos,[11] from the multitude of caimans found there. After burning\r\none of the ships which had become unseaworthy, Córdoba crossed from\r\nthis point to Florida, and thence proceeded to Cuba, where he died\r\nfrom his wounds, ten days after reaching his home at Santi Espíritu.\r\n\r\nDiego Velazquez was much interested in the details of this discovery.\r\nHe closely questioned the two captives about their country, its gold,\r\nits great buildings, and the plants which grew there. When shown the\r\nyucca root they assured the governor that they were familiar with it,\r\nand that it was called by them _tale_, though in Cuba the ground in\r\nwhich the yucca grew bore that name. From these two words, according\r\nto Bernal Diaz, comes the name Yucatan; for while the governor was\r\nspeaking to the Indians of _yucca_ and _tale_, some Spaniards standing\r\nby exclaimed, “You see, sir, they call their country Yucatan.”[12]\r\n\r\nThe people of this coast seemed to have heard of the Spaniards, for at\r\nseveral places they shouted ‘Castilians!’ and asked the strangers by\r\nsigns if they did not come from toward the rising sun. Yet, neither\r\nthe glimpse caught of Yucatan by Pinzon and Solis in 1506 while in\r\nsearch of a strait north of Guanaja Island where Columbus had been,\r\nnor the piratical expedition of Córdoba, in 1517, can properly be\r\ncalled the discovery of Mexico.[13] Meanwhile Mexico can well afford\r\nto wait, being in no haste for European civilization, and the attendant\r\nboons which Europe seems so desirous of conferring.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [1] In the memorial of Antonio Velazquez, successor of\r\n     the adelantado, Diego Velazquez, _Memorial del negocio de\r\n     D. Antonio Velazquez de Bazan_, in _Mendoza_, _Col. Doc.\r\n     Inéd._, x. 80-6, taken from the archives of the Indies,\r\n     the credit of this expedition is claimed wholly for the\r\n     governor. Indeed, Velazquez himself repeatedly asserts, as\r\n     well as others, that the expedition was made at his cost.\r\n     But knowing the man as we do, and considering the claims\r\n     of others, it is safe enough to say that the governor did\r\n     not invest much money in it. The burden doubtless fell on\r\n     Córdoba, who was aided, as some think, by his associates,\r\n     Cristóbal Morante and Lope Ochoa de Caicedo, in making\r\n     up what the men of Darien lacked, _Torquemada_, i. 349,\r\n     notwithstanding the claims for his fraternity of Bernal\r\n     Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, i. Ogilby, _Hist. Am._, 76, says the\r\n     three associates were all Cuban planters; that they equipped\r\n     three ships, Velazquez adding one. This Hernandez de Córdoba\r\n     was not he who served as lieutenant under Pedrarias, though\r\n     of the same name.\r\n\r\n     [2] Opinion has been divided as to the original purpose of\r\n     the expedition. As it turned out, it was thought best on all\r\n     sides to say nothing of the inhuman and unlawful intention\r\n     of capturing Indians for slaves. Hence, in the public\r\n     documents, particularly in the petitions for recompense\r\n     which invariably followed discoveries, pains is taken to\r\n     state that it was a voyage of discovery, and prompted by\r\n     the governor of Cuba. As in the _Décadas Abreviadas de los\r\n     Descubrimientos_, _Mendoza_, _Col. Doc. Inéd._, viii. 5-54,\r\n     we find that ‘El adelantado Diego Velazquez de Cuéllar es\r\n     autor del descubrimiento de la Nueva España,’ so, in effect,\r\n     it is recorded everywhere. Indeed, Bernal Diaz solemnly\r\n     asserts that Velazquez at first stipulated that he should\r\n     have three cargoes of slaves from the Guanaja Islands,\r\n     and that the virtuous one hundred indignantly refused so\r\n     to disobey God and the king as to turn free people into\r\n     slaves. ‘Y desque vimos los soldados, que aquello que pedia\r\n     el Diego Velazquez no era justo, le respondimos, que lo que\r\n     dezia, no lo mandaua Dios, ni el Rey; que hiziessemos á los\r\n     libres esclavos.’ _Hist. Verdad._, i. On the strength of\r\n     which fiction, Zamacois, _Hist. Méj._, ii. 224, launches\r\n     into laudation of the Spanish character. The honest soldier,\r\n     however, finds difficulty in making the world believe\r\n     his statement. Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 348, does not\r\n     hesitate to say very plainly that the expedition was sent\r\n     out to capture Indians, ‘ir é enviar á saltear indios para\r\n     traer á ella,’ for which purpose there were always men with\r\n     money ready; and that on this occasion Córdoba, Morante, and\r\n     Caicedo subscribed 1,500 or 2,000 castellanos each, to go and\r\n     catch Indians, either at the Lucayas Islands or elsewhere.\r\n     Torquemada, i. 349, writes more mildly, yet plainly enough;\r\n     ‘para ir à buscar Indios, à las Islas Convecinas, y hacer\r\n     Rescates, como hasta entonces lo acostumbraban.’ Cogolludo,\r\n     _Hist. Yucathan_, 1-6, follows Bernal Diaz almost literally.\r\n     Gomara, _Hist. Ind._, 60, is non-committal, stating first ‘para\r\n     descubrir y rescatar,’ and afterward, ‘Otros dizen que\r\n     para traer esclauos de las yslas Guanaxos a sus minas y\r\n     granjerias.’ Oviedo and Herrera pass by the question. Landa,\r\n     _Rel. de Yucatan_, 16, ‘a rescatar esclavos para las minas,\r\n     que ya en Cuba se yva la gente apocando y que otros dizen\r\n     que salio a descubrir tierra.’ Says the unknown author of\r\n     _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 338, ‘In has igitur insulas ad grassandum\r\n     et prædandum, ut ita dicam, ire hi de quibus suprà dictum\r\n     est, constituerant; non in Iucatanam.’ It is clear to my\r\n     mind that slaves were the first object, and that discovery\r\n     was secondary, and an after-thought.\r\n\r\n     [3] Bernal Diaz holds persistently to 110. It was 110\r\n     who came from Tierra Firme, and after divers recruits and\r\n     additions the number was still 110.\r\n\r\n     [4] Authorities vary, from four days given by Las Casas,\r\n     and six by Oviedo, to 21 by Bernal Diaz and Herrera. The\r\n     date of departure is also disputed, but the differences are\r\n     unimportant. Compare _Peter Martyr_, dec. iv. cap. vi.;\r\n     _Dufey_, _Résumé Hist. Am._, i. 93; _Clavigero_, _Storia\r\n     Mess._, iii. 3; _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 348-63;\r\n     _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_, 3-8; _Gomara_, _Hist.

To the copies from the Spanish archives, most\r\n     of which have been since published with hundreds of others\r\n     equally or more valuable, he seemed to attach an importance\r\n     proportionate to their cost. Thus, throughout his entire\r\n     work, these papers are paraded to the exclusion of the more\r\n     reliable, but more accessible, standard authorities. In the\r\n     attempt, at this point, to follow at once his document and\r\n     the plainly current facts, he falls into an error of which\r\n     he appears unconscious. He states, _Conq. Mex._, i. 222,\r\n     that Córdoba ‘sailed with three vessels on an expedition to\r\n     one of the neighboring Bahama Islands, in quest of Indian\r\n     slaves. He encountered a succession of heavy gales which\r\n     drove him far out of his course.’ The Bahama Islands are\r\n     eastward from Habana, while Cape San Antonio is toward the\r\n     west. All the authorities agree that the expedition sailed\r\n     directly westward, and that the storm did not occur until\r\n     after Cape San Antonio had been passed, which leaves Mr\r\n     Prescott among other errors in that of driving a fleet to\r\n     the westward, in a storm, when it has already sailed thither\r\n     by the will of its commander, in fair weather.\r\n\r\n     [6] Following Gomara and Torquemada, Galvano mentions the name\r\n     of no other place in this voyage than that of Punta de las\r\n     Dueñas, which he places in latitude 20°. He further remarks,\r\n     _Descobrimentos_, 131, ‘He gẽte milhor atauiada que ha em\r\n     neuhũa outra terra, & cruzes em q’ os Indios adorauam,\r\n     & os punham sobre seus defuntos quando faleciam, donde\r\n     parecia que em algum tẽpo se sentio aly a fe de Christo.’\r\n     The anonymous author of _De Rebus Gestis_ and all the best\r\n     authorities recognize this as the first discovery. ‘Sicque\r\n     non ad Guanaxos, quos petebant, appulerunt, sed ad Mulierum\r\n     promontorium.’ Fernando Colon places on his map, 1527,\r\n     _y: de mujeres_; Diego de Ribero, 1529, _d’ mugeres_, the\r\n     next name north being _amazonas_. Vaz Dourado, 1571, lays\r\n     down three islands which he calls _p:. de magreles_; Hood,\r\n     1592, _Y. de mueres_; Laet, 1633, _Y^{as} de mucheres_;\r\n     Ogilby, 1671, _y^{as} desconocidas_; Dampier, 1699, _I.\r\n     mugeras_; Jefferys, 1776, _Iª de Mujeres_, or _Woman’s\r\n     I._ It was this name that led certain of the chroniclers\r\n     to speak of islands off the coast of Yucatan inhabited by\r\n     Amazons. ‘Sirvió de asilo en nuestros dias al célebre pirata\r\n     Lafitte.’ _Boletin de la Sociedad Mex. de Geog._, iii. 224.\r\n\r\n     [7] For a description of these people see _Bancroft’s Native\r\n     Races_, i. 645-747.\r\n\r\n     [8] See _Landa_, _Rel. de Yuc._, 6. ‘_Domum_ Cotoche sonat:\r\n     indicabant enim domus et oppidum haud longè abesse.’ _De\r\n     Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, i. 339. ‘Conez cotoche, q̄ quiere dezir, Andad\r\n     aca a mis casas.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. ii. cap. xvii.\r\n     ‘Cotohe, cotohe,’ that is to say, ‘a house.’ _Fancourt’s\r\n     Hist. Yuc._, 6. ‘Cotoche, q̄ quiere dezir casa.’ _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, 61. ‘_Con escotoch, con escotoch_, y quiere dezir,\r\n     andad acá á mis casas.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 2.\r\n     This, the north-eastern point of Yucatan, is on Fernando\r\n     Colon’s map, 1527, _gotoche_; on the map of Diego de Ribero,\r\n     1529, _p: d’cotoche_; Vaz Dourado, 1571, _C:. de quoteche_;\r\n     Pilestrina, _c:. de sampalq_. Hood places a little west\r\n     of the cape a bay, _B. de conil_; the next name west is\r\n     _Atalaia_. _Goldschmidt’s Cartog. Pac. Coast_, MS., i. 358.\r\n     Kohl, _Beiden ältesten Karten_, 103, brings the expedition\r\n     here the 1st of March. Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 350,\r\n     confounds Córdoba’s and Grijalva’s voyages in this respect,\r\n     that brings the former at once to Cozumel, when, as a matter\r\n     of fact, Córdoba never saw that island.\r\n\r\n     [9] So called by the natives, but by the Spaniards named\r\n     San Lázaro, because ‘it was a Domingo de Lazaro’ when\r\n     they landed. Yet Ribero writes _chãpa_, while Vaz Dourado\r\n     employs _llazaro_, and Hood, _Campechy_; Laet gives the name\r\n     correctly; Ogilby and Jefferys call the place _S. Fr^{co}\r\n     de Campeche_. ‘Los Indios le deziã Quimpech.’ _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. ii. cap. xvii.\r\n\r\n     [10] Now Champoton, applied to river and town. Ribero\r\n     writes _camrõ_; Hood, _Champoto_; Mercator, _Chapãton_, and\r\n     town next north, _Maranga_. Potonchan, in the aboriginal\r\n     tongue, signifies, ‘Stinking Place.’ Mercator has also the\r\n     town of _Potõchan_, west of Tabasco River. _West-Indische\r\n     Spieghel_, _Patõcham_. Laet, Ogilby, and Jefferys follow\r\n     with _Champoton_ in the usual variations. ‘Y llegaron á\r\n     otra provincia,’ says Oviedo, i. 498, ‘que los indios llaman\r\n     _Aguanil_, y el principal pueblo della se dice _Moscoba_, y\r\n     el rey ó caçique de aquel señorio se llama Chiapoton;’ and\r\n     thus the author of _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_,\r\n     ‘Nec diu navigaverant, cùm Mochocobocum perveniunt.’\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, 340.\r\n\r\n     [11] Pinzon and Solis must have found alligators in their\r\n     northward cruise, otherwise Peter Martyr could not honestly\r\n     lay down on his map of _India beyond the Ganges_, in 1510,\r\n     the _baya d’ lagartos_ north of _guanase_. Mariners must\r\n     have given the coast a bad name, for directly north of\r\n     the _R. de la_ of Colon, the _R:. de laḡ r̄ tos_ of\r\n     Ribero, the _R:. de lagarts_ of Vaz Dourado, and the _R.\r\n     de Lagartos_ of Hood, are placed some reefs by all these\r\n     chart-makers, and to which they give the name _Alacranes_,\r\n     Scorpions. The next name west of Lagartos on Map No. x.,\r\n     _Munich Atlas_, is _costanisa_, and on No. xiii. _Ostanca_.\r\n     Again next west, on both, is _Medanos_. On No. x., next\r\n     to _costa nisa_, and on No. xiii., west of _Punta de las\r\n     Arenas_, is the name _Ancones_. Ogilby gives here _B. de\r\n     Conil_, and in the interior south, a town _Conil_; east\r\n     of _R. de Lagartos_ is also the town _Quyo_, and in large\r\n     letters the name _Chuaca_.\r\n\r\n     [12] ‘Dezian los Españoles q’ estavan hablãdo con el Diego\r\n     Velazquez, y con los Indios: Señor estos Indios dizen, que\r\n     su tierra se llama Yucatã, y assi se, quedò cõ este nõbre,\r\n     que en propria lengua no se dize assi.’ _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     5. Gomara, _Hist. Ind._, 60, states that after naming Catoche, a\r\n     little farther on the Spaniards met some natives, of whom\r\n     they asked the name of the town near by. Tecteta, was the\r\n     reply, which means, ‘I do not understand.’ The Spaniards,\r\n     accepting this as the answer to their question, called\r\n     the country Yectetan, and soon Yucatan. Waldeck, _Voy.\r\n     Pittoresque_, 25, derives the name from the native word\r\n     _ouyouckutan_, ‘listen to what they say.’ The native name\r\n     was Maya. See _Bancroft’s Native Races_, v. 614-34. There\r\n     are various other theories and renderings, among them the\r\n     following: In answer to Córdoba’s inquiry as to the name\r\n     of their country, the natives exclaimed, ‘_uy u tan_,\r\n     esto es: _oyes como habla_?’ _Zamacois_, _Hist. Mej._, ii.\r\n     228. ‘Que preguntando a estos Indios, si auia en su tierra\r\n     aquellas rayzes que se llama Yuca.... Respondian Ilatli,\r\n     por la tierra en que se plantan, y que de Yuca juntado con\r\n     Ilatli, se dixo Yucatta, y de alli Yucatan.’ _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. ii. cap. xviii. Whencesoever the origin, it\r\n     was clearly a mistake, as there never was an aboriginal\r\n     designation for the whole country, nor, like the Japanese,\r\n     have they names for their straits or bays. For some time\r\n     Yucatan was supposed to be an island. Grijalva called the\r\n     country _Isla de Santa María de Remedios_, though that term\r\n     was employed by few. In early documents the two names are\r\n     united; instance the instructions of Velazquez to Cortés,\r\n     where the country is called _la Ysla de Yucatan Sta María de\r\n     Remedios_. On Cortés’ chart of the Gulf of Mexico, 1520, it\r\n     is called _Yucatan_, and represented as an island. Colon,\r\n     1527, and Ribero, 1529, who write _Ivcatan_; Ptolemy, in\r\n     _Munster_, 1530, _Iucatana_; Orontius, on his globe, 1531,\r\n     _Iucatans_; _Munich Atlas_, no. iv., 1532-40, _cucatan_;\r\n     Baptista Agnese, 1540-50, _Iucatan_; Mercator, 1569,\r\n     _Ivcatan_; Michael Lok, 1582, _Incoton_; Hondius, 1595,\r\n     Laet, Ogilby, etc., _Yucatan_, which now assumes peninsular\r\n     proportions.\r\n\r\n     [13]\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: ARMS OF THE REPUBLIC OF MEXICO.]\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: ANCIENT ARMS OF THE CITY OF MEXICO, FROM A\r\n         RARE PRINT.]\r\n\r\n     The term Mexico has widely different meanings under different\r\n     conditions. At first it signified only the capital of\r\n     the Nahua nation, and it was five hundred years before it\r\n     overspread the territory now known by that name. Mexico City\r\n     was founded in 1325, and was called _Mexico Tenochtitlan_.\r\n     The latter appellation has been connected with _Tenuch_, the\r\n     Aztec leader at this time, and with the sign of a nopal on a\r\n     stone, called in Aztec, respectively _nochtli_ and _tetl_,\r\n     the final syllable representing locality, and the first,\r\n     _te_, divinity or superiority. The word Mexico, however,\r\n     was then rarely used, Tenochtitlan being the common term\r\n     employed; and this was retained by the Spaniards for some\r\n     time after the conquest, even in imperial decrees, and in\r\n     the official records of the city, though in the corrupt\r\n     forms of _Temixtitan_, _Tenustitan_, etc. See _Libro de\r\n     Cabildo_, 1524-9, MS. Torquemada, i. 293, states distinctly\r\n     that even in his time the natives never employed any other\r\n     designation for the ancient city than Tenochtitlan, which\r\n     was also the name of the chief and fashionable ward. Solis,\r\n     _Conq. Mex._, i. 390, is of opinion that Mexico was the\r\n     name of the ward, Tenochtitlan being applied to the whole\r\n     city, in which case Mexico Tenochtitlan would signify\r\n     the ward Mexico of the city Tenochtitlan. Gradually the\r\n     Spanish records began to add Mexico to Tenochtitlan, and\r\n     in those of the first provincial council, held in 1555,\r\n     we find written _Tenuxtitlan Mexico_. _Concilios Prov._,\r\n     i. and ii., MS. In the course of time the older and more\r\n     intricate name disappeared, though the city arms always\r\n     retained the symbolic nopal and stone. _Clavigero_, _Storia\r\n     Mess._, i. 168; iv. 265-70; _Soc. Mex. Geog., Boletin_,\r\n     viii. 408-15; _Veytia_, _Hist. Ant. Méj._, ii. 157-9;\r\n     _Humboldt_, _Essai Pol._, i. 146-7; _Cavo_, _Tres Siglos_,\r\n     i. 2; _Carbajal Espinosa_, _Hist. Mex._, i. 92-3. See also\r\n     _Molina_, _Vocabulario_. A number of derivations have been\r\n     given to the word Mexico, as _mexitli_, navel of the maguey;\r\n     _metl-ico_, place amidst the maguey; _meixco_, on the\r\n     maguey border; _mecitli_, hare; _metztli_, moon; _amexica_,\r\n     or _mexica_, you of the anointed ones. The signification\r\n     spring, or fountain, has also been applied. But most writers\r\n     have contented themselves by assuming it to be identical\r\n     with the _mexi_, _mexitl_, or _mecitl_, appellation of the\r\n     war god, Huitzilopochtli, to which has been added the co,\r\n     an affix implying locality; hence Mexico would imply the\r\n     place or settlement of _Mexica_, or _Mexicans_. This war\r\n     god, Huitzilopochtli, as is well known, was the mythic\r\n     leader and chief deity of the Aztecs, the dominant tribe\r\n     of the Nahua nation. It was by this august personage, who\r\n     was also called Mexitl, that, according to tradition, the\r\n     name was given them in the twelfth century, and in these\r\n     words: ‘Inaxcan aocmoamotoca ynamaz te ca ye am mexica,’\r\n     Henceforth bear ye not the name Azteca, but Mexica. With\r\n     this command they received the distinguishing mark of a\r\n     patch of gum and feathers to wear upon their forehead and\r\n     ears. _Bancroft’s Native Races_, ii. 559; iii. 295-6; v.\r\n     324-5 et passim. I can offer no stronger proof as to the way\r\n     in which the name was regarded at the time of the conquest,\r\n     and afterwards, than by placing side by side the maps of the\r\n     sixteenth century and instituting a comparison. In _Apiano_,\r\n     _Cosmographica_, 1575, is a map, supposed to be a copy of\r\n     one drawn by Apianus in 1520, on which _Themisteton_ is\r\n     given apparently to a large lake in the middle of Mexico;\r\n     Fernando Colon, in 1527, and Diego de Ribero, 1529, both\r\n     give the word _Mexico_ in small letters, inland, as if\r\n     applied to a town, although no town is designated; Ptolemy,\r\n     in _Munster_, 1530, gives _Temistitan_; _Munich Atlas_,\r\n     no. vi., supposed to have been drawn between 1532 and\r\n     1540, _Timitistan vel Mesicho_; Baptista Agnese, 1540-50,\r\n     _Timitistan vel Mesico_; Ramusio, 1565, _Mexico_; _Mercator’s\r\n     Atlas_, 1569, _Mexico_, as a city, and _Tenuchitlan_; Michael\r\n     Lok, 1582, _Mexico_, in Hondius, about 1595, in _Drake’s\r\n     World Encompassed_, the city is _Mexico_, and the gulf _Baia\r\n     di Mexico_; Hondius, in _Purchas, His Pilgrimes_, Laet,\r\n     Ogilby, Dampier, _West-Indische Spieghel_, Jacob Colom,\r\n     and other seventeenth-century authorities, give uniformly\r\n     to the city, or to the city and province, but not to the\r\n     country at large, the name as at present written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nJUAN DE GRIJALVA EXPLORES THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE MEXICAN GULF.\r\n\r\n1518.\r\n\r\n     VELAZQUEZ PLANS A NEW EXPEDITION—GIVES THE COMMAND TO\r\n     HIS NEPHEW, JUAN DE GRIJALVA—WHO EMBARKS AT SANTIAGO AND\r\n     STRIKES THE CONTINENT AT COZUMEL ISLAND—COASTS SOUTHWARD TO\r\n     ASCENSION BAY—THEN TURNS AND DOUBLES CAPE CATOCHE—NAMING\r\n     OF NEW SPAIN—FIGHT AT CHAMPOTON—ARRIVAL AT LAGUNA DE\r\n     TÉRMINOS—ALAMINOS, THE PILOT, IS SATISFIED THAT YUCATAN IS\r\n     AN ISLAND—THEY COAST WESTWARD AND DISCOVER THE RIVERS SAN\r\n     PEDRO Y SAN PABLO AND TABASCO—NOTABLE INTERVIEW AT THIS\r\n     PLACE BETWEEN THE EUROPEANS AND THE AMERICANS—THE CULHUA\r\n     COUNTRY—THEY PASS LA RAMBLA, TONALÁ, THE RIO GOAZACOALCO, THE\r\n     MOUNTAIN OF SAN MARTIN, THE RIVERS OF ALVARADO AND BANDERAS,\r\n     AND COME TO THE ISLANDS OF SACRIFICIOS AND SAN JUAN DE ULUA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Diego Velazquez talked with Córdoba’s men, and with the captives,\r\nMelchor and Julian, and examined the articles obtained from the\r\nnatives, their superior kind and workmanship, and the gold and\r\nimages taken from the temple at Catoche by Father Gonzalez, all grew\r\nsignificant of yet greater things beyond. The hardships attending\r\nthe expedition were light to him who did not share them, and the late\r\ncommander being now dead, the governor found himself free to act as\r\nbest suited him.\r\n\r\nHe determined at once on a new expedition. There was a young man who\r\nseemed admirably fitted for the purpose, Juan de Grijalva, a gentleman\r\nof the governor’s own town of Cuéllar, nephew of Velazquez, though\r\nsome deny the fact; he was twenty-eight years of age, handsome,\r\nchivalrous, courteous, and as honest as he was brave. He had been\r\nwith the governor for some time, and the wonder was how so bad a\r\nmaster should have so good a man. There was no lack of volunteers,\r\ntwo hundred and forty[14] coming forward at once; among them several\r\nwho afterward became famous. Two caravels were added to the two\r\nbrought back by Córdoba, making in all, refitted and equipped, four\r\nvessels, the _San Sebastian_, the _Trinidad_, the _Santiago_, and the\r\n_Santa María de los Remedios_. The pilots and many of the men from\r\nthe former expedition were engaged, and some natives of Cuba were\r\ntaken as servants. Grijalva, as commander of the armada, directed\r\none vessel, and Pedro de Alvarado, Alonso Dávila, and Francisco\r\nde Montejo,[15] were appointed captains of the others. Grijalva’s\r\ninstructions were not to settle, but only to discover and trade.[16]\r\nLicense was obtained from the Jeronimite Fathers, who stipulated that\r\nFrancisco de Peñalosa should accompany the expedition as veedor. As\r\npriest, attended one Juan Diaz,[17] and Diego de Godoy went as notary.\r\n\r\nEmbarking from Santiago de Cuba the 8th of April, 1518, and leaving\r\nCape San Antonio on Saturday,[18] the first of May, they fell to the\r\nsouth of their intended course, and on Monday sighted the island of\r\nCozumel,[19] which they named Santa Cruz,[20] “because,” says Galvano,\r\n“they came to it the third of May.” After passing round the northern\r\npoint on the sixth[21] in search of anchorage, the commander landed\r\nwith a hundred men, and ascending a high tower took possession of the\r\ncountry; after which, mass was said. And Las Casas questions if it\r\nwas quite right for Juan Diaz to hold this solemn service in a place\r\nwhere sacrifices were wont to be made to Satan; for even between the\r\ntwo great and formal exercises of the Spaniards, an old Indian priest\r\nwith his attendants had entered and had blown incense before the\r\nidols, as if to rouse his gods to vindicate their might before these\r\nopposing worshippers. To the point was given the name San Felipe y\r\nSantiago, and to a town standing near, that of San Juan ante Portam\r\nLatinam. Then they entered the town, and found there houses of stone,\r\nand paved streets, in the eyes of Juan Diaz not unlike the towns of\r\nSpanish construction. Meanwhile, a small party penetrated one or two\r\nleagues into the interior, and observed other towns and cultivated\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhile crossing to the Yucatan coast the following day, they descried\r\nin the distance three towns, and, as they descended toward the south,\r\na city “so large that Seville could not show to better advantage.”\r\nNext they came to a great opening in the shore, to which, after\r\nAlaminos had examined it in a boat, they gave the name of Bahía de la\r\nAscension, from the day of discovery. Unable to find a pass in this\r\ndirection round the supposed island of Yucatan, they turned back,\r\npassed Cozumel, and, rounding the peninsula, arrived at Campeche the\r\n25th, rescuing on their way a woman from Jamaica.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEverywhere they beheld the same evidences of high culture seen by\r\nCórdoba, the tower-temples and crosses of the Mayas rising from\r\ngracefully outlined promontories, and glistening white from behind\r\nlegended hills, leading them every moment to anticipate the discovery\r\nof some magnificent city, such as in our day has been revealed to an\r\nadmiring posterity; for while the East buries her ancient cities in\r\ndust, the West none the less effectually hides hers in foliage. And\r\nof the monuments to the greatness of the past, and of the profitless\r\nmillions here engendered, who shall speak? And why do men call\r\nnature considerate or kind? Does she not create only to destroy, and\r\nbestow blessings and cursings with the same merciless indifference?\r\nSurpassingly lovely, she is at once siren, nurse, and sanguinary\r\nbeldam. This barren border of the peninsula rested under a canopy of\r\nclear or curtained sky, and glared in mingled gloom and brightness\r\nbeside the fickle gulf; and from the irregular plains of the interior\r\ncame the heated, perfumed air, telling here of treeless table-lands,\r\nof languid vegetation, and there of forests and evergreen groves.\r\n“It is like Spain,” cried one. And so they called the country Nueva\r\nEspaña,[22] which name, at first applied only to the peninsula of\r\nYucatan, finally spread over the whole of the territory afterward\r\nknown as Mexico.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Campeche, or more probably at Champoton,[23] occurred a notable\r\naffray. The fleet anchored toward sunset, half a league from shore.\r\nThe natives immediately put on a warlike front, bent on terrible\r\nintimidations, which they continued in the form of shouts and\r\ndrum-beating during the entire night. So great was their necessity for\r\nwater that the Spaniards did not wait for the morning, but amidst the\r\narrows, stones, and spears of the natives, they landed the artillery\r\nand one hundred men before daybreak, another hundred quickly following.\r\nBut for their cotton armor the invaders would have suffered severely\r\nduring this operation. Having reached the shore, however, the guns\r\nwere planted, and the natives charged and driven back with the loss\r\nof three Spaniards slain and sixty wounded, the commander-in-chief,\r\never foremost in the fight, being three times struck and losing two\r\nteeth. Two hundred were killed and wounded among the natives. The town\r\nwas found deserted. Presently three ancient Americans appeared, who\r\nwere kindly entreated, and despatched with presents to the fugitives,\r\nbut they never returned. Two nights were spent ashore, the tower and\r\nsacred edifices adjacent being used as barracks.\r\n\r\nEmbarking, soon a large opening in the coast was discovered, and\r\nentered by Grijalva, the chaplain says, the last day of May. Puerto\r\nDeseado[24] the commander called his anchorage, being the desired\r\nspot in which might be repaired the leaky ships. The Spaniards\r\nthought themselves at first at the mouth of a river, but on further\r\nexamination, it appeared to them more like a sea. Whereupon the\r\npilot Alaminos, who, notwithstanding evidence to the contrary,\r\nnotwithstanding three days’ explorings, left this salt-sheet still\r\nlandlocked, never ceased insisting that Yucatan was an island, and\r\nhe now gravely assured his commander that the great opening opposite\r\nAmatique Bay and Golfo Dulce, or if that were too far, then opposite\r\nChetumal or Ascension, confirmed his suppositions, and settled the\r\nmatter in his mind that this was the termination of the islands;\r\nhence the names Boca de Términos, and Laguna de Términos,[25] which\r\nfollowed. The temples here seen were supposed by the Spaniards to be\r\nplaces where merchants and hunters made their sacrifices. A greyhound,\r\neager in the pursuit of game, neglected to return in time and was\r\nleft behind; when the Spaniards came with Cortés they found the animal\r\nwell-fed and happy, but excessively glad to see them. Before departing,\r\nGrijalva again declared for Spain, “as if,” growls Las Casas, “the\r\nthousand possessions already taken were not enough.” Indeed, this\r\nfierce charging on a continent, so often repeated, hurling upon the\r\ninhabitants a new religion and a new king, was about as effective\r\nas Caligula’s advance on Britain, when, preparatory to crossing, he\r\ndrew up his troops in battle array, on the seaboard, and gave orders\r\nto collect shells, the spoils of conquered ocean.\r\n\r\nProceeding the 8th of June, and creeping stealthily along the\r\ncoast,[26] dropping anchor at night and weighing it with the dawn,\r\nthey came to a river which they called San Pedro y San Pablo, and\r\nthen to a larger one, the native name of which was Tabasco,[27] after\r\nthe cacique of the city, but which the Spaniards called Grijalva, in\r\nhonor of their commander.\r\n\r\nThe face of nature here changed. The low, gray hills of the peninsula\r\ngave place to elevations of enlivening green, made lustrous by large\r\nand frequent streams. Boldly in the front stood the heights at present\r\nknown as San Gabriel; beyond continued the flat, monotonous foreground\r\nof a gorgeous picture, as yet but dimly visible save in the ardent\r\nimaginings of the discoverers.\r\n\r\nThe two smaller vessels only could enter this river of Tabasco,\r\nwhich, though broad, was shallow-mouthed; and this they did very\r\ncautiously, advancing a short distance up the stream, and landing at\r\na grove of palm-trees, half a league from the chief town. Upon the\r\nsix thousand[28] natives who here threatened them, they made ready\r\nto fire; but by peaceful overtures the sylvan multitude were brought\r\nto hear of Spain’s great king, of his mighty pretensions, and of the\r\nSpaniards’ inordinate love of gold. The green beads the natives thought\r\nto be stone made of their chalchiuite, which they prized so highly,\r\nand for which they eagerly exchanged food. Having a lord of their\r\nown they knew not why these rovers should wish to impose upon them a\r\nnew master; for the rest they were fully prepared, if necessary, to\r\ndefend themselves. During this interview, at which the interpreters,\r\nMelchor and Julian, assisted, the word Culhua,[29] meaning Mexico,\r\nwas often mentioned in answer to demands for gold, from which the\r\nSpaniards inferred that toward the west they would find their hearts’\r\ndesire. Then they returned to their ships.\r\n\r\nIn great state, unarmed, and without sign of fear, Tabasco next day\r\nvisited Grijalva on board his vessel. He had already sent roasted fish,\r\nfowl, maize bread, and fruit, and now he brought gold and feather-work.\r\nOut of a chest borne by his attendants was taken a suit of armor, of\r\nwood overlaid with gold, which Tabasco placed upon Grijalva, and on\r\nhis head a golden helmet, giving him likewise masks and breast-plates\r\nof gold and mosaic, and targets, collars, bracelets, and beads, all of\r\nbeaten gold, three thousand pesos in value. With the generous grace\r\nand courtesy innate in him, Grijalva took off a crimson velvet coat\r\nand cap which he had on when Tabasco entered, also a pair of new red\r\nshoes, and in these brilliant habiliments arrayed the chieftain, to\r\nhis infinite delight.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards departed from Tabasco with further assurances of\r\nfriendship, and two days later sighted the town of Ahualulco, which\r\nthey named La Rambla, because the natives with tortoise-shell shields\r\nwere observed hurrying hither and thither upon the shore. Afterward\r\nthey discovered the river Tonalá, which was subsequently examined\r\nand named San Antonio;[30] then the Goazacoalco,[31] which they could\r\nnot enter owing to unfavorable winds; and presently the great snowy\r\nmountains of New Spain, and a nearer range, to which they gave the name\r\nSan Martin,[32] in justice to the soldier who first saw it. Overcome\r\nby his ardor, Pedro de Alvarado pressed forward his faster-sailing\r\nship, and entered before the others a river called by the natives\r\nPapaloapan, but named by his soldiers after the discoverer;[33]\r\nfor which breach of discipline the captain received the censure of\r\nhis commander. The next stream to which they came was called Rio de\r\nBanderas,[34] because the natives appeared in large numbers, carrying\r\nwhite flags on their lances.\r\n\r\nWith these white flags the natives beckoned the strangers to land;\r\nwhereupon twenty soldiers were sent ashore under Francisco de\r\nMontejo, and a favorable reception being accorded them, the commander\r\napproached with his ships and landed. The utmost deference was paid the\r\nguests, for, as will hereafter more fully appear, the king of kings,\r\nLord Montezuma, having in his capital intelligence of the strange\r\nvisitors upon his eastern seaboard, ordered them to be reverentially\r\nentertained. In the cool shade was spread on mats an abundance of\r\nprovisions, while fumes of burning incense consecrated the spot and\r\nmade redolent the air. The governor of this province was present with\r\ntwo subordinate rulers, and learning what best the Spaniards loved,\r\nhe sent out and gathered them gold trinkets to the value of fifteen\r\nthousand pesos. So valuable an acquisition impelled Grijalva to claim\r\nonce more for Charles, one of the natives, subsequently christened\r\nFrancisco, acting as interpreter. After a stay of six days the fleet\r\nsailed, passing a small island, white with sand, which Grijalva called\r\nIsla Blanca, and then the Isla Verde, gleaming green with foliage\r\namidst the green waters, four leagues from the continent; coming\r\npresently to a third island, a league and a half from the mainland,\r\nwhich afforded good anchorage. This, according to Oviedo, was on the\r\n18th of June. On landing the Spaniards found two stone temples, within\r\nwhich lay five human bodies, with bowels opened and limbs cut off;\r\nand all about were human heads on poles, while at the top of one of\r\nthe edifices, ascended by stone steps, was the likeness of a lion in\r\nmarble, with a hollow head, showing the tongue cut out, and opposite\r\nto it a stone idol and blood-fount. Here was evidently a sacrifice\r\nto some pagan deity; and touching it is to witness the horror with\r\nwhich these men of Spain regarded such shocking spectacles, while\r\nviewing complacently their own atrocious cruelties.\r\n\r\nCrossing from Isla de Sacrificios, as they called this blood-bespattered\r\nplace, the Spaniards landed on the adjoining mainland, and making for\r\nthemselves shelter with boughs and sails began trading for gold; but\r\nthe natives being timid and returns inconsiderable, Grijalva proceeded\r\nto another island, less than a league from the mainland and provided\r\nwith water. Here was a harbor sheltered from the dread yet grateful\r\nnorth winds, which in winter rush in with passionate energy, driving\r\naway the dreadful summer vómito and tumbling huge surges on the strand,\r\nthough now they formed but a wanton breeze by day, which slept on\r\nwaves burnished by the radiant sun or silvered by the moon. Here they\r\nlanded and erected huts upon the sand.[35] To the Spaniards all nature\r\nalong this seaboard seemed dyed with the blood of human sacrifices.\r\nAnd here, beside evidences of heathen abominations in the forms of a\r\ngreat temple, idols, priests, and the bodies of two recently sacrificed\r\nboys, they had gnats and mosquitoes to annoy them, all which led them\r\nto consider the terror of their voyage and the advisability of return.\r\nOf the Indian, Francisco, Grijalva asked the significance of the\r\ndetestable rite of ripping open living human bodies and offering bloody\r\nhearts to hungry gods; and the heathen answered, because the people of\r\nCulhua, or Ulua, as he pronounced the name, would have it so. From this\r\ncircumstance, together with the facts that the name of the commander\r\nwas Juan, and that it was now about the time of the anniversary of the\r\nfeast of John the Baptist, the island was named San Juan de Ulua,[36]\r\nwhile the continent in that vicinity was called Santa María de las\r\nNieves.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [14] Solis and Herrera say 250; Gomara and Galvano, 200; Peter\r\n     Martyr, 300, etc.\r\n\r\n     [15] Torquemada, i. 358, asserts that Montejo furnished\r\n     his own vessel, and that Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero,\r\n     Alonso Dávila, Diego de Ordaz, and others, went at their\r\n     own cost.\r\n\r\n     [16] As upon this point, that is to say, the orders and their\r\n     fulfilment, turned the destiny, not only of Grijalva, but\r\n     of the conquest, there has been much controversy over it.\r\n     ‘Si Iuan de Grijalua supiera conocer aquella buena vẽtura,\r\n     y poblara alli como los de su compañia le rogauan, fuera\r\n     otro Cortes, mas no era para el tanto bien, ni lleuaua\r\n     comission de poblar.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Ind._, 57-8. Partisans\r\n     of Cortés regard Grijalva with disdain, while no one seems\r\n     greatly to care for Velazquez. Bernal Diaz was of opinion\r\n     that the matter of founding a colony was left to Grijalva’s\r\n     discretion; but Las Casas, who had much better opportunities\r\n     for knowing, being intimate with the governor, and at special\r\n     pains to ascertain the truth of the matter, states clearly\r\n     that Grijalva’s instructions were positive, that he should\r\n     not settle but only trade. ‘Bartolome de las Casas, autor\r\n     de mucha fe, y que con particular cuydado lo quiso saber, y\r\n     era gran amigo, y muy intimo de Diego Velazquez, dize que\r\n     fue la instruccion que espressamente no poblasse, sino q̄\r\n     solamente rescatasse.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap.\r\n     i. So hold Torquemada, Solis, and all careful writers on\r\n     the subject.\r\n\r\n     [17] Or as he calls himself, ‘capellano maggior’ of the\r\n     armada. Long before the soldier, Bernal Diaz, published\r\n     his ‘True History,’ Juan Diaz had given to the world an\r\n     account of the voyage, _Itinerario de la isola de Iuchatan_,\r\n     following the _Itinerario de Ludovico de Varthema Bolognese\r\n     nella Egitto_, etc., in a volume printed at Venice in 1520.\r\n     Juan Diaz disputes the honor with Bartolomé de Olmedo of\r\n     having first said mass in the city of Mexico.\r\n\r\n     [18] Here again Prescott falls into error in attempting to\r\n     follow a manuscript copy of Juan Diaz, without due heed to\r\n     the standard chroniclers. Mr Prescott writes, _Mex._, i.\r\n     224, ‘The fleet left the port of St Jago de Cuba, May 1,\r\n     1518,’ and refers to the _Itinerario_ of Juan Diaz in proof\r\n     of his statement. But Juan Diaz makes no such statement.\r\n     ‘Sabbato il primo giorno del mese de Marzo,’ he says,\r\n     _Itinerario_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 281, ‘de\r\n     questo sopradito anno parti il dicto capitaneo de larmata\r\n     de lisola Fernandina.’ Saturday, the 1st day of May, the\r\n     armada left the island of Fernandina, or Cuba. The writer\r\n     does not intimate that they left the port of Santiago on\r\n     that day, which, as a matter of fact, they did not, but the\r\n     extreme western point of the island, Cape San Antonio. This\r\n     Prescott might further have learned from Herrera, dec. ii.\r\n     lib. iii. cap. i., ‘Despachado pues Iuan de Grijalua de todo\r\n     punto, salio del puerto de Sãtiago de Cuba, a ocho de Abril\r\n     deste año de 1518;’ from Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 6,\r\n     who states that all met and attended mass at Matanzas, the\r\n     5th of April, just prior to sailing; ‘Y despues de auer oîdo\r\n     Missa con gran deuocion, en cinco dias del mes de Abril de\r\n     mil y quinientos y diez y ocho años dimos vela;’ from Solis,\r\n     _Conq. Mex._, 25, ‘tardaron finalmente en hacerse á la mar\r\n     hasta los ocho de Abril;’ from Robertson, _Hist. Am._, i.\r\n     241, ‘He sailed from St Jago de Cuba on the 8th of April,’\r\n     etc. Ternaux-Compans perpetrates two gross blunders in the\r\n     first four lines of his translation of this _Itinerario_ of\r\n     Juan Diaz. First he writes March for May, ‘equivocando,’\r\n     as Icazbalceta says, ‘la palabra _mazo_ del original con\r\n     _marzo_.’ and, secondly, he brings the fleet to Cozumel\r\n     Island on the 4th, when his author writes the 3d, which is\r\n     enough, without the palpable absurdity of making Monday the\r\n     4th day of a month wherein the previous Saturday was the\r\n     1st. Oviedo states, i. 503, that ‘salieron del puerto de\r\n     la cibdad de Sanctiago á los veynte é çinco dias del mes de\r\n     enero;’ that they were at Matanzas the 12th of February, at\r\n     Habana the 7th of April; that they left Matanzas finally\r\n     the 20th of April, and San Antonio the 1st of May, in all\r\n     which, except the last statement, he is somewhat confused.\r\n\r\n     [19] Like a good soldier, Bernal Diaz makes the time fit\r\n     the occasion. ‘A este pueblo,’ he says, _Hist. Verdad._, 7,\r\n     ‘pusimos por nombre Santa Cruz; porq̄ quatro, ò cinco diaz\r\n     antes de Santa Cruz le vimos.’ The native name of the island\r\n     was _Acusamil_—Landa, _Rel. de Yuc._, 20, writes it _Cuzmil_;\r\n     Cogolludo, _Hist. Yucathan_, 10, _Cuzamil_—Swallow’s\r\n     Island, which was finally corrupted into the Cozumel of\r\n     the Spaniards. Mercator, indeed, writes _Acusamil_, in\r\n     1569, although Colon, Ribero, and Hood had previously given\r\n     _coçumel_, _cozumel_, and _Cosumel_, respectively. Vaz\r\n     Dourado comes out, in 1571, with _quoqumell_, since which\r\n     time the name has been generally written as at present.\r\n\r\n     [20] Some of the authorities apply the name Santa Cruz to a\r\n     port; others to a town found there; but it was unquestionably\r\n     the island to which they gave this name. ‘A questa isola\r\n     de Coçumel che ahora se adimanda Santa Croce.’ _Diaz_,\r\n     _Itinerario_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 287. ‘Se\r\n     le puso nombre á esta ĩsla _Sancta Cruz_, á la qual los\r\n     indios llaman _Coçumel_.’ _Oviedo_, i. 504.\r\n\r\n     [21] This, according to Diaz; Oviedo says they landed on\r\n     Wednesday, the 5th, and again on the 6th; and Bernal Diaz\r\n     affirms that the landing took place on the south side of\r\n     the island.\r\n\r\n     [22] It was the crosses, which the Spaniards here regarded\r\n     of miraculous origin, more than any physical feature which\r\n     after all gave the name to these shores. Cortés established\r\n     it for all the region under Aztec sway, and under the\r\n     viceroys it was applied to all the Spanish possessions\r\n     north of Guatemala, including the undefined territories\r\n     of California and New Mexico. _Humboldt_, _Essai Pol._, i.\r\n     6-7, and others, have even shown an inclination to embrace\r\n     thereunder Central America, but for this there is not\r\n     sufficient authority. See _Medina_, _Chron. de San Diego de\r\n     Mex._, 227; _Lopez Vaz_, in _Purchas, His Pilgrimes_, iv.\r\n     1432, and _Gottfriedt_, _Newe Welt_, 74; also Torquemada,\r\n     from Herrera, and several standard authors. New Spain was\r\n     for a long time divided into the three kingdoms of New\r\n     Spain, New Galicia, and New Leon, each composed of several\r\n     provinces. Under the administration of Galvez, this division\r\n     gave way to intendencias, among them Mexico and a few\r\n     provinces, and New Spain came to be limited in the north\r\n     by the Provincias Internas, though including for a time at\r\n     least the Californias. With the independence the name New\r\n     Spain was replaced by Mexico, less because this term applied\r\n     to the leading province and to the capital, than because\r\n     the name was hallowed by association with the traditions\r\n     of the people, whose blood as well as sympathies contained\r\n     far more of the aboriginal element than of the imported.\r\n     On Colon’s map the name is given in capital letters, _Nova\r\n     Spaña_. Under _Nveva España_ Ribero writes _dixose asì por\r\n     que ay aquy muchas cosas que ay en españa ay ya mucho trigo\r\n     q̄ an lleuado de aca entanta cantidad q̄ lo pueden encargar\r\n     para otras partes ay aquy mucho oro de nacimiento_. Robert\r\n     Thorne, in _Hakluyt’s Voy._, carries _Hispania Noua_ east\r\n     and west through Central America, while Ramusio, _Viaggi_,\r\n     iii. 455, places _La Nova Spagna_ in large letters across\r\n     the continent.\r\n\r\n     [23] It is remarkable, as I have often observed, how two\r\n     eye-witnesses can sometimes tell such diametrically opposite\r\n     stories; not only in regard to time and minor incidents,\r\n     but to place and prominent events. In this instance Diaz\r\n     the priest is no less positive and minute in placing the\r\n     affair at Campeche, than is Diaz the soldier, at Champoton.\r\n     The second-rate authorities, following these two writers\r\n     who were present, are divided, by far the greater number,\r\n     Herrera among the rest, accepting the statement of Bernal\r\n     Diaz. Oviedo, who was a resident of the Indies at the time,\r\n     describes the battle as occurring at Campeche. Perhaps\r\n     one reason why the soldier-scribe has more adherents than\r\n     the priest, is because the existence of the narrative\r\n     of the latter was not so well known. Las Casas affirms,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, iv. 425, that the pilot unintentionally\r\n     passed Lázaro’s port, or Campeche, and landed and fought\r\n     at Champoton. ‘Llegaron, pues, al dicho pueblo (que, como\r\n     dije, creo que fué Champoton, y no el de Lázaro).’\r\n\r\n     [24] Puerto Escondido. On the maps of Colon and Hood it\r\n     is placed as one of the eastern entrances of the Laguna de\r\n     Términos, the former writing _p. deseado_, and the latter\r\n     _P. desiado_; Gomara places the _Laguna de Términos_ between\r\n     Puerto Deseado and Rio Grijalva. On Ribero’s map, north\r\n     of Escondido, _isla ger_, Vaz Dourado marking in the same\r\n     locality _p:. seqº amgratriste_, Dampier gives _Boca\r\n     Eschondido_, and Jefferys, _Boca Escondida_.\r\n\r\n     [25] Velazquez had instructed his captain to sail round\r\n     the island of Yucatan. Cortés, in 1519, ordered Escobar to\r\n     survey this sheet, which was found to be a bay and shallow.\r\n     Still the pilots and chart-makers wrote it down an island.\r\n     It is worthy of remark that in the earliest drawings, like\r\n     Colon’s, in 1527, the maker appears undecided, but Ribero,\r\n     two years later, boldly severs the peninsula from the\r\n     continent with a strait. See _Goldschmidt’s Cartog. Pac.\r\n     Coast_, MS., i. 412-14. The earliest cartographers all\r\n     write _terminos_, Ribero marking a small stream flowing\r\n     into the lagoon, _R:. de x p̅ianos_. Here also is the\r\n     town and point of Jicalango. Ogilby calls the lagoon _Lago\r\n     de Xicalango_, east of which is the name _N^{ra} S^{ra} de\r\n     la Vitoria_; Dampier places south of _Laguna Termina_ the\r\n     town _Chukabul_; Jefferys writes in large letters, a little\r\n     south of _Laguna de Xicalango_ or _Terminos_, the words\r\n     _Quehaches Indios Bravos_. Kohl thinks Puerto Escondido\r\n     may be the Puerto Deseado of Grijalva mentioned by Gomara.\r\n\r\n     [26] Of ‘la isola riccha chiamata Ualor,’ as the chaplain\r\n     calls it, _Diaz_, _Itinerario_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, i. 295, ‘descoprir una altra terra che se dice Mulua.’\r\n     Alaminos believed New Spain to be another island distinct\r\n     from Yucatan. The natives called it Coluá, says Las Casas,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, iv. 428.\r\n\r\n     [27] On the chart of Cortés, 1520, it is called _R:. de\r\n     Guzalua_, and placed west instead of east of Rio Santa\r\n     Ana. Ribero writes, _R:. de grisalua_; Vaz Dourado, _Rº.\r\n     de grigalua_; Hood, _R. de Grisalua_; _Mercator’s Atlas_,\r\n     1574, has a town, _Tausco_; Ogilby, Dampier, and Jefferys\r\n     employ the name _Tabasco_. Kohl ascribes the name of the\r\n     river _San Pedro y San Pablo_ to Grijalva. Colon has _R:. de\r\n     s. pablo_; Ribero, _R. de s:. Pabº_; _Munich Atlas_, No.\r\n     iv., _rio de s. p._; Baptista Agnese, _rio de S. paulo_;\r\n     Hood, _R. de S. Pablo_; Ogilby, _S. Paulo_: Dampier, _St.\r\n     Peter_, _St. Paul_, etc. As there are plenty of streams\r\n     in that vicinity Herrera gives one to Grijalva and still\r\n     leaves the chieftain, Tabasco, his own.\r\n\r\n     [28] It is Las Casas who testifies to 6,000; Bernal Diaz\r\n     enumerates 50 canoes; Herrera speaks of three _Xiquipiles_\r\n     of 8,000 men each, standing ready in that vicinity to oppose\r\n     the Spaniards, waiting only for the word to be given.\r\n\r\n     [29] Not ‘Culba, Culba, Mexico, Mexico,’ as Bernal Diaz has\r\n     it. The natives pronounced the word Culhua only; but this\r\n     author, finding that Culhua referred to Mexico, puts the\r\n     word Mexico into the mouth of Tabasco and his followers.\r\n     Long before the Aztecs, a Toltec tribe called the Acolhuas,\r\n     or Culhuas, had settled in the valley of Mexico. The\r\n     name is more ancient than that of Toltec, and the Mexican\r\n     civilization might perhaps as appropriately be called Culhua\r\n     as Nahua. The name is interpreted ‘crooked’ from coloa, bend;\r\n     also ‘grandfather’ from _colli_. Colhuacan might therefore\r\n     signify Land of our Ancestors. Under Toltec dominion a\r\n     tripartite confederacy had existed in the valley of Anáhuac,\r\n     and when the Aztecs became the ruling nation, this alliance\r\n     was reëstablished. It was composed of the Acolhua, Aztec,\r\n     and Tepanec kingdoms, the Aztec king assuming the title\r\n     Culhua Tecuhtli, chief of the Culhuas. It is evident that\r\n     the Culhuas had become known throughout this region by\r\n     their conquests, and by their culture, superior as it was\r\n     to that of neighboring tribes. The upstart Aztecs were only\r\n     too proud to identify themselves with so renowned a people.\r\n     The name Culhua was retained among the surrounding tribes,\r\n     and applied before Grijalva to the Mexican country, where\r\n     gold was indeed abundant.\r\n\r\n     [30] ‘Das grosse Fest des heiligen Antonius von Padua fällt\r\n     auf den 13 Juni, und dies giebt uns also eine Gelegenheit\r\n     eines der Daten der Reise des Grijalva, deren uns die\r\n     Berichterstatter, wie immer, nur wenige geben, genau\r\n     festzusetzen.’ _Kohl_, _Beiden ältesten Karten_, 105. Cortés,\r\n     in his chart of the Gulf of Mexico, 1520, calls it _Santo\r\n     Anton_; Fernando Colon, 1527, _R. de la Balsa_, with the\r\n     name _G. de s. anton_ to the gulf; Ribero, 1529, _r: de\r\n     Sãton_; Globe of Orontius, 1531, _C. S. ãto_; Vaz Dourado,\r\n     1571, _rio de S. ana_; Hood, 1592, _R. de S. Antonio_, etc.\r\n     For _Santa Ana_ Dampier in 1699 lays down _St. Anns_, and\r\n     Jefferys in 1776, _B. St. Ann_.\r\n\r\n     [31] Cortés calls it _Rio de totuqualquo_; Colon, _R. de\r\n     gasacalcos_; Ribero, _R. de guasacalco_; Orontius, _R.\r\n     de qualqº_; Vaz Dourado, _R.º de de guaqaqa_; Hood, _R.\r\n     de Guaca_; Mercator, _Quacaqualco_; De Laet, Ogilby, _R.\r\n     de Guazacoalco_; Jefferys, _R.

Martin_; Dampier, _St. Martin’s High Land_,\r\n     and _St. Martin’s Point_. This soldier, San Martin, was a\r\n     native of Habana.\r\n\r\n     [33] Herrera makes the Indian name Papaloava; Bernal Diaz,\r\n     Papalohuna, Cortés, 1520, and Orontius, 1531, give _R.\r\n     d alvarado_; Colon, 1527, _R: del comendador aluarado_;\r\n     Ribero, 1529, _R:. de Aluarado_; Vaz Dourado, 1571, _Rº.\r\n     de Alluorado_, etc. ‘Die Karte von 1527 hat den _Rio del\r\n     comendador Alvarado_ etwas weiter westlich, jenseits des\r\n     Rio de banderas, welches keineswegs mit den Berichten des\r\n     Bernal Diaz übereinstimmt.’ _Kohl_, _Beiden ältesten Karten_,\r\n     106.\r\n\r\n     [34] Some of the early maps place this stream incorrectly\r\n     east of the Papaloapan; where Ribero writes _P. delgada_,\r\n     first east from _R: de uanderas_, Vaz Dourado writes _p:.\r\n     de hiqada_.\r\n\r\n     [35] The Chaplain Diaz affirms that ten days were passed\r\n     on the mainland, where Indians dressed in mantles brought\r\n     them food, and where they melted their gold into bars;\r\n     and that on the San Juan Island they appointed one of the\r\n     natives cacique, christening him Ovando. ‘El capitaneo li\r\n     disse che non volevano se non oro et loro resposseno che lo\r\n     portariano laltro giorno portorono oro fondido in verghe\r\n     et lo capitaneo li disse che portasseno molto d quello.’\r\n     _Itinerario_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 299.\r\n\r\n     [36] To distinguish it, Herrera says, from San Juan de Puerto\r\n     Rico. On the chart of Cortés, 1520, the _B:. de Sant Juan_\r\n     is laid down, but no other names are given except that of\r\n     _Sacrificios Island_, which is placed some distance out and\r\n     called _Yˢ della creficio_. On Orontius’ globe, 1531, three\r\n     islands are called _Insula Sacrifici_. Colon lays down _R:\r\n     de s. Juhan_; _R. salado_; _R: de s. x pouae_ (christobal);\r\n     _villa rica_, and _y^{eo}: de sacreficios_. Ribero designates\r\n     _R:. de s. Jua_; _R:. de cãpual_; _uilla rica_, and _y:.ª\r\n     de saćficios_. Vaz Dourado writes _R.º de Säo_ (santo)\r\n     _Joáo_ (_Juan_); _llaueracrus_ (la vera cruz), and _uilla\r\n     riqua_ (villa rica). Hood gives _R. de medelin_; _S. Jon\r\n     delua_; _Laueracruz_; _Sen Jual_; _Villa Rica_; and marks\r\n     the point south of Vera Cruz _P. de antonisardo_. Mercator\r\n     gives _Villa Rica_; Ogilby, _S. Juan de Luz_, and north\r\n     of it _Villarica_. On another of his maps we find _S. Juan\r\n     de Lua_; _P^{ta} de Antº Sardo_, _I. y Fuerca de la vera\r\n     Cruz nueva_, _La Vera Cruz_, _R. Medelin_, and _Y^{as} de\r\n     Sacrificios_. See further _Cartography North Am._, MS., i.\r\n     531. Las Casas confounds the islands Sacrificios and Ulua,\r\n     calling them one. The Spaniards supposed the continent\r\n     thereabout, far into the interior, was known to the natives\r\n     as Culhua; hence we find Velazquez, in his instructions to\r\n     Cortés, _Mendoza_, _Col. Doc._, xii. 227, speaking of ‘una\r\n     tierra grande, que parte della se llama Ulúa, que puso por\r\n     nombre Santa María de las Nieves.’ See also _Oviedo_, i. 539.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nRETURN OF GRIJALVA. A NEW EXPEDITION ORGANIZED.\r\n\r\n1518.\r\n\r\n     REFUSAL OF GRIJALVA TO SETTLE—ALVARADO SENT BACK TO\r\n     CUBA—GRIJALVA CONTINUES HIS DISCOVERY—AFTER REACHING\r\n     THE PROVINCE OF PÁNUCO HE TURNS BACK—TOUCHING AT THE\r\n     RIO GOAZACOALCO, TONALÁ, THE LAGUNA DE TÉRMINOS, AND\r\n     CHAMPOTON, THE EXPEDITION RETURNS TO CUBA—GRIJALVA TRADUCED\r\n     AND DISCHARGED—A NEW EXPEDITION PLANNED—VELAZQUEZ SENDS\r\n     TO SANTO DOMINGO AND SPAIN—CHARACTERS OF VELAZQUEZ AND\r\n     GRIJALVA CONTRASTED—CANDIDATES FOR THE CAPTAINCY OF THE NEW\r\n     EXPEDITION—THE ALCALDE OF SANTIAGO SUCCESSFUL—HIS STANDING AT\r\n     THAT TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt various places during this expedition, notably where is now\r\nVera Cruz, and at the River Tabasco, both in coming and returning,\r\nGrijalva’s men begged permission to settle and subdue the country. In\r\ntheir desire to remain they pictured to themselves all the pleasures\r\nof the abandoned crew of Ulysses, in a land as happy as that of which\r\nHorace sang, where Ceres decked untilled fields with sheaves and\r\nBacchus revelled under purple-clustered vines. And they were angry with\r\ntheir commander for not breaking the instructions which forbade his\r\ncolonizing. Pedro de Alvarado was particularly chafed by the restraint,\r\nthough he kept his temper until he obtained permission to return to\r\nCuba with one of the vessels[37] which had become unseaworthy, so as\r\nto report to the governor the progress of the discovery, and obtain\r\nrecruits and fresh supplies, with permission to found a colony.\r\nBeside some fifty sick persons, all the gold, cotton, and other\r\narticles obtained from the natives thus far were placed in Alvarado’s\r\nship, which sailed the 24th of June. The remainder of the expedition\r\ncontinued its now north-westward course past Nautla,[38] which the\r\nSpaniards called Almería, and with the mountains of Tuxpan[39] in full\r\nview, advanced as far as Cabo Rojo, some say as far as the Rio de\r\nPánuco.[40] The entrance to the large lagoon now known as the Bahía\r\nde Tanguijo, was mistaken for a river and named Rio de Canoas. On\r\nanchoring here the ships of the Spaniards were fiercely attacked by\r\nthe occupants of twelve canoes,[41] which came out from a large city\r\ncompared by the worthy chaplain to Seville in size and magnificence,\r\nin common with other towns along this seaboard; and as if this were\r\nnot strange enough, the same authority goes on to relate a miracle\r\nwhich happened here because Grijalva refused the soldiers leave to\r\nsack the place; how a star, poised above the fleet after sunset, shot\r\ntoward the town and hung over it invitingly, as if Jehovah signified\r\nhis pleasure that the Christians should seize the city.[42]\r\n\r\nAfter beating back the canoes the Spaniards proceeded, but found\r\ntheir course impeded by the currents off Cabo Rojo; from which\r\ncircumstance, together with the hostility of the natives, the rapidity\r\nwith which the season was advancing, and the condition of the ships,\r\nthey determined to return. Turning toward the southward, therefore,\r\nthey were carried past the River Goazacoalco by boisterous winds, and\r\nentered Tonalá to careen and repair a leaky vessel.[43] Again the\r\nmen blasphemed and held the commander in derision because he would\r\nnot settle. After several failures in starting they continued the\r\nvoyage, encountered bad weather, touched at Deseado for water, engaged\r\nin a parting fight with the natives of Champoton, sailed again, and\r\nthe fifth reached San Lázaro, where they were led into ambush while\r\nsearching for water, and attacked. After helping themselves to maize\r\nthey embarked, followed the shore past Rio de Lagartos, the Comi of\r\nthe natives, whence they sailed for Cuba, and arrived at Matanzas\r\nabout the first of November.[44]\r\n\r\nWhen Grijalva cast anchor in the bay of Matanzas his heart beat high\r\nwith promise. He had returned successful from a brilliant discovery,\r\nin which had begun that pronounced mastery of life which is the\r\ndream of every chivalrous mind. There had been nothing in the least\r\nirrational in his policy, or fickle or factious in his conduct. He\r\nhad used diligence and discretion, had been true to his companions,\r\nand faithful to his king and to his chief. Surely his uncle would\r\npraise him, his governor would reward him, and his king would intrust\r\nhim with new commissions. So he deserved; so he had every reason to\r\nexpect, and hence it was with pride and pleasure that he once more\r\nset foot on Isla Fernandina.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, this most virtuous cavalier was now destined\r\nto reap the too common reward of honest service in the cause of a\r\nvicious master. Scarcely had Grijalva landed, when a letter from\r\nthe governor was placed in his hand, ordering him to repair with his\r\nships at once to Santiago, and at the same time to notify his soldiers\r\nthat opportunity would be quickly given all who desired to embark in\r\na fresh adventure to New Spain, and that meanwhile they might rest\r\nthemselves at the governor’s farms in that vicinity. Then, too, he\r\nfirst learned how Velazquez, ever fickle and distrustful as are all\r\ntimid and unscrupulous men, becoming nervous concerning the fleet,\r\nhad sent Cristóbal de Olid in a small vessel with seven soldiers\r\nto search and report; and that on reaching the coast of Yucatan a\r\nstorm had obliged the explorer to part with his anchor and return\r\nto Cuba.[45] Before the return of Olid, Alvarado had arrived with\r\nthe gold and good tidings from the armada, which gave the governor\r\nunbounded joy. Grijalva had yet to learn, however, how Alvarado,\r\nnot forgetting the censure bestowed on him for disobedience, had not\r\nfailed to color the conduct of his commander to suit his own ends.\r\nGrijalva’s repeated refusals to colonize were paraded as the gross\r\nmistakes of a stubborn and spiritless man; the coolness and bravery\r\ndisplayed at Champoton were made to appear as reckless imprudence; and\r\nas the governor thought of the danger to which his adventure had there\r\nbeen subjected, he became alarmed. “Had I lost all,” he muttered, “it\r\nwould have been a just penalty for sending such a fool.” And now both\r\nDávila and Montejo poured fresh poison into the ear of the governor\r\nrespecting his nephew, in revenge for similar fancied injuries; so\r\nthat when Grijalva reported himself to Velazquez at Santiago, he was\r\ntold to go his way, since the governor had no further use for him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this line of action had been for some time determined on.\r\nImmediately upon the arrival of Alvarado, a new expedition had been\r\nplanned, in which Grijalva was not to participate. The latter was hurt,\r\nalmost to death. He had conferred a great benefit on this Tiberius\r\nof an uncle; but as affection is heightened by the conferring of\r\nbenefits, so it is often lessened by the acceptance of them. Not long\r\nafter, Juan de Salcedo was sent to Santo Domingo for permission to\r\ncolonize New Spain, and Benito Martin, chaplain and man of business,\r\nwas despatched to Spain[46] with a full account of the discovery,\r\nand with gold for the bishop of Búrgos. Haste seemed necessary to\r\nVelazquez lest some one might anticipate and rob him of the honors\r\nand emoluments won through Grijalva’s efforts. Nor were forgotten the\r\nLicentiate Zapata and the Secretary Conchillos; and so happily were\r\ndistributed the Indian villages of Cuba among these conscientious men\r\nof Spain, that Velazquez gained all his requests, with the title of\r\nadelantado of Cuba added.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow different the quality of these two men, Velazquez and Grijalva,\r\nand both so widely different from the phœnix now about to rise from\r\ntheir ashes! The character of the governor was like a candle flame, hot\r\nwithout and hollow within. Almost as much as gold he loved glory, the\r\nbrass and tinsel of it, but lacked both the ability and the courage\r\nto achieve noble distinction. As easily worked upon by designing men\r\nas Othello, there was in him none of the nobility of the Moor; and,\r\npossessing no great integrity himself, he was very ready to suspect\r\ntreachery in others.\r\n\r\nGrijalva, on the other hand, was the Lysander of New World discovery;\r\nof a modest though manly spirit, obedient to customs and superior\r\nauthority, preferring honor and duty to self and pleasure, native\r\nto generous action, the very faults brought out by his enemies shine\r\nbrilliant as virtues. He was as chivalrous as any Spaniard that ever\r\ndrew steel on naked savage, as brave and talented as any. But he\r\nlacked the unscrupulous positiveness inseparable here from permanent\r\nsuccess. He was resolute in overcoming difficulties, and he was\r\nstrong and shrewd enough in the prosecution of any high enterprise,\r\nparticularly so long as fortune favored him; but he was no match for\r\nthe subtle-minded of his own nation, who overwhelmed him in their show\r\nof learning, backed by imposing forms. All contemporary writers speak\r\nwell of him; likewise all the chroniclers, except Gomara, who permits\r\nchivalry no place save in his pet and patron, Cortés. The soldier\r\nBernal Diaz pronounces him a most worthy officer. The historians\r\nOviedo and Herrera call him a comely man, thoroughly loyal, and never\r\nbackward at fighting. Yet we are told that some censured him, while\r\nothers cursed him outright for his conscientiousness, because he did\r\nnot break orders and seize opportunity. So ready were they to engage\r\nin the fallacious argument that it was right to do wrong if good might\r\ncome of it. To disobey Velazquez, they said, was to break no divine\r\nlaw; forgetting that the governor derived his authority from the king,\r\nand the king from the Almighty. Of a truth, when force alone is the\r\nstandard of right, then honesty is not the best policy. For a time he\r\ncarried himself with a brave front, conscious of his integrity, yet\r\nwe may say he was laid low forever by the blow misfortune here gave\r\nhim.[47] Meanwhile patience, good governor! For soon enough will arise\r\nan agent capable of playing shrewd tricks to your ample contentment.\r\n\r\nBefore the return of Grijalva, interest in the new expedition had\r\nalready raised itself into a whirl of excitement; and as volunteers\r\npressed forward, the captaincy became an apple of discord among\r\naspirants. Chief among these were Vasco Porcallo a near relative of the\r\ncount of Feria, Antonio Velazquez,[48] and Bernardino Velazquez, the\r\nlast two kinsmen of the governor. Another was Baltasar Bermudez,[49]\r\nfrom Velazquez’ own town, and his intimate friend. None of these\r\nsuited. Then followed for the governor nights of troubled dreams and\r\ndays of irritable indecision. It was a peculiar personage Velazquez\r\nwanted. He must be, in Mexico, courageous, wise, and prudent; in\r\nCuba, obedient, teachable. He must be able to command men, to brave\r\nthe proudest barbarian, and so fired by enthusiasm in the field as\r\ncheerfully to endure hardships and risk life; his work successfully\r\naccomplished, he must return humbly to Santiago, and lay his trophies\r\nat the feet of his master. Grijalva was most nearly such a man; but\r\nhe lacked that subtle second sense which should tell him when it was\r\nthe governor’s pleasure to have his orders disobeyed. Porcallo was\r\ncompetent, but Velazquez was afraid of him. He was scarcely farther\r\nfrom the throne than himself; and in reporting any important conquest\r\nto the king would prove the greater of the two. The relatives present\r\nwere worse, if anything, than Grijalva; besides, they had no means,\r\nand to this position the successful aspirant must bring money as well\r\nas courage and discretion. Bermudez might be eligible, but for his\r\nservices, in braving the dangers, and bringing the results of the\r\nexpedition to Velazquez, he had the temerity to demand three thousand\r\nducats. The proposition was not for a moment to be entertained; the\r\njob must be accomplished for less money.\r\n\r\nWatchful eyes saw the governor’s dilemma, and artful tongues wagged\r\nopportunely. Near to him in their daily vocations were two men, both\r\nsmall in stature, but large of head, and broad in experience and\r\nsagacity. One was the governor’s secretary, Andrés de Duero, and\r\nthe other the royal contador, Amador de Láres. Both possessed rare\r\nattainments; they were skilled in every artifice, and could make\r\ntheir master see white or black; while Láres could not write, he had\r\nnot failed to profit by a twenty-two years’ career in Italy, during\r\nwhich time he rose to the honorable distinction of chief butler to the\r\nGran Capitan, and he seldom found it difficult to move the unstable\r\nVelazquez to his purposes, although they were not always the purest and\r\nbest.[50] Following the example of the governor, these two worthies\r\nwere not averse to improving their fortunes by securing, at little\r\nrisk or expense, an interest in the New Spain conquest; and so they\r\ngave heed when the alcalde of Santiago softly insinuated that he was\r\nthe man for the emergency, and that if they would help him to the\r\ncommand they should share the profits.[51]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe alcalde of Santiago bore a fair reputation, considering the\r\ntime and place; for comparatively few names in the New World were\r\nthen wholly free from taint. In the prime of manhood, his age being\r\nthirty-three, of full medium stature, well proportioned and muscular,\r\nwith full breast, broad shoulders, square full forehead, small straight\r\nspare compact body and well turned limbs, though somewhat bow-legged,\r\nhe presented a pleasing rather than imposing front. His portraits\r\nshow fine antique features, bearing a somewhat sad expression, which\r\nwas increased by the grave tenderness of the dark oval eyes. The full\r\nthough thin beard, cut short, counteracted to some extent the effect\r\nof the small ash-colored face, and served to cover a deep scar on\r\nthe lower lip, the memento of a duel fought in behalf of a certain\r\nfrail fair one.\r\n\r\nHe was an exceedingly popular alcalde; there was nothing staid or\r\nsombre in his method of administering justice. The law was less to\r\nhim than expediency, and his standard of right was easily shifted,\r\naccording to circumstances. In wit and vivacity he was a Mercutio.\r\nAstute of intellect, discreet, of a cheerful, even jovial disposition,\r\nwith brilliant intuitions and effervescent animal spirits, he knew\r\nhow to please, how to treat every man as best he liked to be treated.\r\nA cavalier of the Ojeda and Balboa type, he was superior to either.\r\nHe would not, like the former, woo danger for the mere pleasure of\r\nit, nor, like the latter, tamely trust his forfeited head to any\r\ngovernor. Life was of value to him; yet adventure was the rhythm of\r\nit, and the greater the peril the greater the harmony secured. An\r\nhidalgo of respectable antecedents, whatever he might have been,\r\nor might be, he now played the part of magistrate to perfection.\r\nAs a matter of course, he was in entire sympathy with the religious\r\nviews of the day, as well as with the leading men among the clergy.\r\nIndeed the friars ever praised him, believing him to be a zealous and\r\nconscientious man; he made it a point that they should. The moral\r\nideal of the Japanese is politeness. Politeness is virtue. They do\r\nnot say that lying and stealing are wrong, but impolite. While the\r\nalcalde if pressed must confess himself an optimist, believing that\r\nwhatever is, is best, yet in practice that best he would better, and\r\nwhatsoever his strength permitted, it was right for him to do. He was\r\na sort of Mephistopheles, decked in manners and guided by knowledge.\r\nBesides the world, he knew books, and how to make somewhat of them.\r\nEarnestly devoted to the service of the church, many of his acts yet\r\nmet with its most unqualified condemnation. Possessed of vehement\r\naspirations, his ambition was of the aggressive kind; not like that\r\nof Velazquez, mercenary and timid. Like Tigellinus Sophonius, it was\r\nto his pleasing person and unscrupulous character that the alcalde\r\nowed his rise from poverty and obscurity; and now, like Phaethon,\r\nif for one day he might drive the governor’s sun-chariot across the\r\nheavens, it would be his own fault if he were not a made man. This\r\nmuch at this time we may say of Hernan[52] Cortés, for such was the\r\nalcalde’s name; which is more than he could say for himself, not\r\nknowing himself as we know him, and more than his associates could say\r\nof him. Hereafter as his character develops we shall become further\r\nacquainted with him. It is as difficult to detect the full-grown\r\nplant in a seed as in a stone, and yet the seed will become a great\r\ntree, while the stone remains a stone.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with the aid of his loving friends Duero and Láres, whose\r\ndeft advice worked successfully on the plastic mind of Velazquez, and\r\nbecause he possessed some money and many friends, as well as courage\r\nand wisdom, the alcalde of Santiago was proclaimed captain-general of\r\nthe expedition.[53] And now, while the heathen wail let the Spaniards\r\nrejoice. Yes. Noble Castilian! cry aloud! for gold shall fill the\r\ncoffers of your king as they were never filled before, and great\r\nshall be the glory of your kingdom; and if the sight of the blood\r\nyour captains shall draw from the hapless savages, even more freely\r\nthan gold is drawn, does not spoil your appetite for the game, then\r\nwhet your swords for the grand pacification.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [37] Herrera says it was the _San Sebastian_; Oviedo, the\r\n     _Trinidad_.\r\n\r\n     [38] Town and river given both by Cortés and Orontius. Colon\r\n     writes _R: de almeria_; Ribero, _almera_; Vaz Dourado,\r\n     _allmeira_; Hood, _Almeria_; nos. vi. and vii., _Munich\r\n     Atlas_, _rio de almeria_, and Mercator, _Almeria_. Ogilby\r\n     places north of _Lhanos de Almeria_ a large gulf labelled\r\n     _R. de S Pº y S Paulo_, and south of it _Toluia_, and _Tore\r\n     Branco_. Dampier lays down _Almeria I._ opposite _Tispe_\r\n     and _Haniago Isle_ on the mainland. Laet gives _Naothlan\r\n     ó Almeria_, and _Lhanos de Almeria_.\r\n\r\n     [39] ‘Vimos las sierras de Tusta, y mas adelante de a hi á\r\n     otros dos dias vimos otros sierras muy altas, q̄ agora se\r\n     llamã las sierras de Tuspa;’ so called, Bernal Diaz says,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 10, from the towns lying at their base.\r\n     The Rio de Tuxpan is supposed to be the _San Pedro y San\r\n     Pablo_ of early days. ‘Da das Peter-und-Pauls-Fest auf den\r\n     29 Juni.’\r\n\r\n     [40] Kohl thinks Grijalva did not pass Cabo Rojo, the\r\n     _C:. roxo_ of Vaz Dourado, and Hood, and I am inclined to\r\n     agree with him. Bernal Diaz says, _Hist. Verdad._, 10, ‘Y\r\n     esto es ya en la Provincia de Panuco: é yendo por nuestra\r\n     nauegaciõ llegamos á vn rio grande, que le pusimos por nõbre\r\n     Rio de Canoas.’ The nomenclature of this stream is quite\r\n     regular in the several times and places. Cortés gives _Rio\r\n     Panuco loaton_; Colon, _R: panuco_; Ribero and Vaz Dourado,\r\n     _panuco_; Orontius, _R. panico_; Hood, _Panuço_; Baptista\r\n     Agnese, _panucho_, and _rio panucho_; no. vi. _Munich\r\n     Atlas_ the same; Ptolemy, 1530, in _Munster_, _Panuco_;\r\n     Mercator, river and town _Panuco_, and next town south\r\n     _Chila_. And so on with Hondius, Ogilby, Dampier, and the\r\n     rest. See _Goldschmidt’s Cartog. Pac. Coast_, MS., i. 578.\r\n     Upon the hypothesis that the San Pedro y San Pablo and the\r\n     Tuxpan were two streams, the latter may have been the Rio\r\n     de Canoas of Grijalva and the Pánuco discovered by Montejo\r\n     and Alaminos the year following, as Kohl surmises, but not\r\n     otherwise. Herrera says the expedition did not pass Cabo\r\n     Rojo; Bernal Diaz speaks of a wide projecting cape, which\r\n     does not exist beyond the Pánuco River. Yet both affirm\r\n     that the province of Pánuco was reached, and we well know\r\n     that little would be said to strangers of an aboriginal\r\n     province by its inhabitants before its great town, or its\r\n     great river, was approached. Hence the general impression\r\n     that Grijalva on this occasion coasted as far as Tampico,\r\n     and that the Pánuco was his Rio de Canoas. It is my opinion\r\n     that the entrance to the Bahia de Tanguijo, mistaken for\r\n     a river, was the Rio de Canoas of Grijalva, and that Cabo\r\n     Rojo was his ultimate point of discovery.\r\n\r\n     [41] Some say sixteen.\r\n\r\n     [42] In questo giorno sul tardi vedessemo miracolo ben grande\r\n     el qual fu che apparve una stella incima la nave dapoi el\r\n     tramontar del sole et partisse sempre buttando razi fino che\r\n     se pose sopra quel vilagio over populo grande et lasso uno\r\n     razo ne laiere che duro piu de tre hore grande et anchora\r\n     vedessimo altri signal ben chiari dove comprendessemo che\r\n     dio volea per suo servitio populassemo la dicta terra.\r\n     _Itinerario_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 302.\r\n\r\n     [43] Bernal Diaz claims to have planted here the first\r\n     orange-seeds sown in New Spain. It was at the base of a\r\n     temple, on whose summit he had enjoyed a refreshing sleep,\r\n     above the clouds of mosquitoes, and through gratitude\r\n     he sowed these seed, which he had brought from Cuba. He\r\n     tells, likewise, of obtaining here by barter 4,000 pesos,\r\n     which, with the 16,000 pesos Alvarado carried home, made\r\n     20,000 pesos secured during the voyage. Among the treasures\r\n     were some copper hatchets, which the Spaniards took to\r\n     be an inferior kind of gold. Las Casas gives a detailed\r\n     description of the treasures obtained by this expedition,\r\n     among which was an emerald worth 2,000 ducats, from the\r\n     mainland opposite Isla de Sacrificios.\r\n\r\n     [44] This, following Oviedo, who in 1523 visited Velazquez,\r\n     and was told these things. Other authors give widely\r\n     different accounts of Grijalva’s return, most of them\r\n     taking him at once from Tonalá to Matanzas, but allowing\r\n     forty days for the voyage. Oviedo dates Grijalva’s arrival\r\n     at the River Goazacoalco July 9; at Deseado, August 17;\r\n     at Champoton, September 1; San Lázaro, September 5, and\r\n     Matanzas, October 8, which is too early, according to the\r\n     date of Cortés’ instructions.\r\n\r\n     [45] Oviedo says that Olid went to Cozumel and took\r\n     possession of the island, thinking he had discovered it;\r\n     then coasting north and westward to a port, Laguna de\r\n     Términos, and finding no traces of Grijalva, and having\r\n     lost his anchors, he returned to Matanzas eight days before\r\n     Grijalva; but in this statement he is sustained neither by\r\n     his contemporaries nor by his own collateral statements.\r\n     Velazquez’ instructions to Cortés are dated the 23d of\r\n     October, at which time neither Olid nor Grijalva had\r\n     returned, since Cortés is told to search for them; both\r\n     arrived, however, before he sailed.\r\n\r\n     [46] It was in May, 1519, according to Oviedo, that Benito\r\n     Martin—some call him Martinez—sailed for Spain, Grijalva\r\n     having arrived at Santiago late in the October previous.\r\n     By reference to a Velazquez memorial, in iv. 233-4, _Col.\r\n     Doc. Inéd._, we find that before this, upon the strength\r\n     of Córdoba’s discovery, the king, on the 13th of November,\r\n     1518, at Saragossa, made Velazquez adelantado of what he\r\n     had discovered, or might discover. Thus far he claimed as\r\n     having found, at his own cost, Cozumel and Yucatan, the Santa\r\n     María de los Remedios of the Spaniards, which was not true.\r\n     Indeed, these memorials of the descendants of conquerors\r\n     are, as a rule, widely different from the facts; instance\r\n     this one again, which gives Olid seventy men instead of\r\n     seven. As a matter of course, the honor of the discovery is\r\n     claimed wholly for the governor of Cuba, to the prejudice\r\n     of others who ventured more than he. See _Carta del Ayunt.\r\n     de Vera Cruz_, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i. 418-9. Instance\r\n     further a _Memorial del negocio de D. Antonio Velazquez de\r\n     Basan_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, x. 80-6,\r\n     in which Grijalva is given five ships and a year and a half,\r\n     and Olid three ships and seventy men. In the _Instruccion\r\n     que dió el adelantado Diego Velazquez á Hernan Cortés_,\r\n     in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, xii. 226-46, the little boat of Olid\r\n     has grown into a caravel with 80 or 90 men.\r\n\r\n     [47] Las Casas saw him at Santo Domingo in 1523. He was\r\n     reduced to penury. Proceeding thence to Panamá, he was\r\n     sent by Pedrarias to Nicaragua, where he was killed. So\r\n     perished the best and morally bravest of cavaliers, while\r\n     unscrupulous tricksters flourished. Prior to his departure\r\n     from Cuba, however, and notwithstanding the vile treatment\r\n     of the governor, at Velazquez’ request, Grijalva wrote a\r\n     narrative of his expedition, which was lost by Oviedo in\r\n     its transmission to the king. It is embodied, however, in\r\n     substance, in _Oviedo_, i. 502-37. One of the most original\r\n     and complete accounts of Grijalva’s expedition extant is\r\n     that by the priest Juan Diaz, _Itinerario de Larmata del\r\n     Re Catholico in India verso la Isola de Iuchathan del anno\r\n     M. D. XVIII, alla qual fu Presidente & Capitan Generale\r\n     Ioan de Grisalva; el qual e facto per el capellano maggior\r\n     de dicta Armata a sua Altezza_, published in Italian, at\r\n     Venice, in 1520, in French by Ternaux-Compans, in 1838, the\r\n     former being copied and quoted in manuscript by Prescott. The\r\n     issue at Venice was as the second part of the _Itinerario de\r\n     Ludovico de varthema Bolognese nello Egitto, nella Soria_,\r\n     etc., and was there begun, _Qui comincia lo Itinerario de\r\n     Lisola de Iuchatan nouamente ritrouata per il signor Gioan\r\n     de Grisalue_, etc. By far the best edition is that given\r\n     with a Spanish translation by Icazbalceta, in his _Col.\r\n     Doc._, i. 281-308, printed in Mexico in 1858. Next is the\r\n     account by Bernal Diaz, who, like the chaplain, accompanied\r\n     the expedition, thus giving us narratives by eye-witnesses\r\n     at once from ecclesiastical and secular stand-points. The\r\n     statements of Gomara, _Hist. Ind._, 56-8, and _Hist. Mex._, 9-11,\r\n     must be taken with allowance. Worse still are the memorials\r\n     of the relatives of Velazquez to sovereign majesty, such\r\n     as that found in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, x.\r\n     80-6, which are little better than tissues of misstatements\r\n     and exaggerations. Solis, _Hist. Mex._, i. 24-40, gives\r\n     a fair, full, and graphic statement of particulars. The\r\n     _Instruccion que dió el adelantado Diego Velazquez á Hernan\r\n     Cortés_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xii.\r\n     226-51, also important, as furnishing original collateral\r\n     light. Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 16, 421-4, though full,\r\n     is specially inaccurate and weak, not only in his facts,\r\n     but in his deductions. Nor is Peter Martyr, dec. iv. cap.\r\n     iii., any stronger. _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 4-6,\r\n     _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 341-6, and _Landa_, _Rel. de Yuc._, 21,\r\n     are mediocre; and _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap. i.\r\n     and ix., is quite full and very valuable. Cogolludo, _Hist.\r\n     Yucathan_, 8-16, gives a fair résumé, but a far better one\r\n     is Torquemada’s, i. 351-7. Prescott’s account, _Mex._, i.\r\n     224-9, is meagre and imperfect, though his deductions are\r\n     much more sound than those of Robertson’s _Hist. Am._, i.\r\n     240-3. One of the most superficial of the modern narratives\r\n     of this expedition is given by Zamacois, _Hist. Méj._,\r\n     ii. 236-52. Those by Morelet, _Voy. dans l’Am. Cent._, i.\r\n     179-85, and Fancourt’s _Hist. Yuc._, 9-18, are valuable. A\r\n     collection of extracts from several letters to Charles V.,\r\n     referring to Yucatan, and forming ‘an account of a recently\r\n     discovered island, describing its locality, the customs\r\n     and habits of its inhabitants,’ was printed at Nuremberg,\r\n     by Frederick Peypus, in 1520, under title beginning _Ein\r\n     auszug ettlicher sendbrieff dem aller durchleüchtigisten_.\r\n     Carbajal Espinosa, _Hist. Mex._, i. 51-65, ii. 21, and\r\n     Ramirez, in his Mexican edition of Prescott, i. 132 and 135,\r\n     beside narratives, give portraits of Velazquez, Córdoba, and\r\n     Grijalva. _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, 9-13, and _Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 27-50, are most valuable\r\n     from an aboriginal stand-point. Alaman, in his _Disert._,\r\n     i. 49-91, treats of both Córdoba’s and Grijalva’s voyages.\r\n     Among the many allusions to these two expeditions of no\r\n     special significance are those found in _Ogilby’s Am._, 76-8;\r\n     _Purchas, His Pilgrimes_, v. 858; _Oveido_, _Sommario_,\r\n     in _Ramusio_, _Viaggi_, iii. 182-9; _Soc.

Bernal Diaz\r\n     gives Borrego as the second surname.\r\n\r\n     [49] Bernal Diaz says Augustin Bermudez.\r\n\r\n     [50] Las Casas regarded him as a schemer, and often warned\r\n     Velazquez against ‘Veintidos años de Italia.’ _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     iv. 447. He calls him likewise ‘Burgalés’ and ‘hombre\r\n     astutísimo.’\r\n\r\n     [51] ‘Que partirian,’ says Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 13,\r\n     ‘entre todos tres la ganancia del oro, y plata, y joyas,\r\n     de la parte que le cupiesse á Cortés,’ and also, growls\r\n     Las Casas, _ubi supra_—knowledge of the facts as yet being\r\n     but rumor—what Cortés could steal from the king and the\r\n     governor was subject to division, beside what he would rob\r\n     from the natives.\r\n\r\n     [52] Hernan, Hernando, Fernan, Fernando, Ferdinando. The\r\n     names are one. With no special preference, I employ the\r\n     first, used by the best writers. Among the early authorities,\r\n     Solis, the Spanish translator of _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi\r\n     Cortesii_, and many others, write Hernan; Pizarro y Orellana,\r\n     _Varones Ilvstres_, Fernan; Bernal Diaz and Oviedo, Hernando;\r\n     Gomara, Fernando. In accordance with the Spanish usage of adding\r\n     the mother’s surname, he is sometimes, though rarely, called\r\n     Cortés y Pizarro. For portrait and signature I refer the\r\n     reader to _Alaman_, _Disert._, i. app. i. 15-16; portrait\r\n     as an old man; _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 6-8;\r\n     _Prescott’s Mex._, iii. 1; _Id._, (ed. Mex., 1846, iii.\r\n     210-11); _Armin_, _Alte Mex._, 82, plate from the painting\r\n     in the Concepcion Hospital at Mexico; _March y Labores_,\r\n     _Marina Española_, i. 466.\r\n\r\n     [53] In making out the commission Duero stretched every\r\n     point in favor of his friend, naming him captain-general\r\n     of lands discovered and to be discovered, as well as of\r\n     the fleet. _Solis_, _Hist. Mex._, i. 47; for the greater\r\n     the share of Cortés, the greater Duero’s share. Gomara says,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 12, ‘Hablo a Fernâdo Cortés para q̄ armassen\r\n     ambos a medias, porq̄ tenia dos mil Castellanos de oro,’\r\n     etc.; but 2000 castellanos alone would not purchase a half\r\n     interest in this undertaking. Las Casas, loc. cit., states\r\n     that Velazquez, for reasons that will appear in the next\r\n     chapter, was very cautious in intercourse with Cortés until\r\n     his scruples were overcome by advisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE HERO OF THE CONQUEST.\r\n\r\n     BIRTHPLACE OF HERNAN CORTÉS—HIS COMING COMPENSATORY FOR\r\n     THE DEVIL-SENT LUTHER—PARENTAGE—HERNAN A SICKLY CHILD—SAINT\r\n     PETER HIS PATRON—HE IS SENT TO SALAMANCA—RETURNS HOME—THINKS\r\n     OF CÓRDOBA AND ITALY—AND OF OVANDO AND THE INDIES—CHOOSES\r\n     THE LATTER—NARROW ESCAPE DURING A LOVE INTRIGUE—OVANDO\r\n     SAILS WITHOUT HIM—CORTÉS GOES TO VALENCIA—IS THERE\r\n     ILL—RETURNS HOME—FINALLY SAILS FOR THE INDIES—HIS RECEPTION\r\n     AT SANTO DOMINGO—HE FIGHTS INDIANS UNDER VELAZQUEZ, AND\r\n     IS GIVEN AN ENCOMIENDA—GOES TO CUBA WITH VELAZQUEZ—MAKES\r\n     LOVE TO CATALINA SUAREZ—BUT DECLINES TO MARRY—VELAZQUEZ\r\n     INSISTS—CORTÉS REBELS—SEIZURES, IMPRISONMENTS, ESCAPES, AND\r\n     RECONCILIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now look into the life of this Cuban magistrate, so suddenly\r\nraised to prominence.\r\n\r\nMedellin, a small town of Estremadura, Spain, was the birthplace of\r\nHernan Cortés, and 1485 the year in which he was born—miraculously\r\nborn, as Mendieta and others believe, and perhaps by way of\r\ncompensation for the appearing about this time of Martin Luther.[54]\r\nThe shade of Montezuma, peradventure, might deny that his was the\r\nadvent of a new Messiah, though the deluded monarch, at the first,\r\nsorrowfully hailed him as such. The father, Martin Cortés y Monroy,\r\nwas of that poor but prolific class who filled Spain toward the close\r\nof the Moorish wars, and who, although nothing in particular, were\r\nnevertheless permitted to call themselves hidalgos, sons of something.\r\nSome give him the title of escudero, others place him still higher in\r\nthe scale of fighting men. The mother, Catalina Pizarro y Altamirano,\r\nlikewise, with poverty, claimed noble blood.[55]\r\n\r\nHernan was a sickly child, and probably would have died had not his\r\ngood nurse, María de Estévan, secured in his behalf Saint Peter,\r\nthenceforth his patron.[56] With his mother’s milk he drank courage[57]\r\nand intelligence, and he was schooled in the virtues and the vices\r\nof the day. In his youth he was headstrong, but chivalrous, and he\r\nrevelled in his superiority over other boys. The brain-ferment, chronic\r\nthroughout his life, set in at an early day. He was keenly sensitive\r\nto disgrace. As he developed somewhat of archness and duplicity,\r\nhe was deemed best fitted for the profession of the law. At the\r\nage of fourteen, accordingly, with such preparation as the slender\r\nmeans of the father would allow, he was sent to Salamanca, whose\r\nuniversity, though past the zenith of its fame, was still the leading\r\nseat of learning for conservative Spain. Two years of restraint and\r\nintellectual drudgery, during which time he lived with his father’s\r\nbrother-in-law, Nuñez de Valera, sufficed to send him home surfeited\r\nwith learning, to the great disappointment of his family.[58] A\r\nfrolicsome and somewhat turbulent disposition, more marked since his\r\ncollege career than previously, made his return all the more unwelcome.\r\nNot that his studies, despite his aversion to them, had been wholly\r\nneglected; he could boast a smatter of Latin, which indeed proved\r\nof advantage afterward, giving him influence over many of those with\r\nwhom he associated. He had also acquired some knowledge of rhetoric,\r\nas is manifest in his letters and occasional verses.[59] At present,\r\nhowever, his intellectual talents were employed only in scribbling\r\nrhymes in aid of amorous intrigues, which were now his chief pursuit.\r\nHence when arms possessed his fancy the parents did not repine, but\r\nwere only too glad for him to enter service, as he seemed inclined,\r\nunder the Gran Capitan, who was just then alluring to his standard\r\nthe chivalry of Spain by brilliant achievements in Italy. There was,\r\nhowever, the glitter of gold in the Indies, and the appointment of\r\nNicolás de Ovando,[60] as governor, turned the youth’s vacillating\r\nmind in that direction.\r\n\r\nCortés had concluded to accompany the new governor, when one night,\r\njust before the sailing of the fleet, an accident intervened. While\r\nengaged in one of his intrigues he had occasion to climb a courtyard\r\nwall to gain the lady’s apartment. The wall crumbling beneath his\r\nweight threw him to the ground, and the noise brought to the door\r\nof an adjoining house a blustering Benedick, who, perceiving the\r\nsituation of the gallant, and suspecting his own newly made wife,\r\ndrew the sword with bloody intent. At the prayer of the suspected\r\nwife’s mother, however, the husband suspended vengeance. Before the\r\nscapegrace recovered from a fever brought on by the bruises received\r\nin this fall, the fleet of Ovando had sailed.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Cortés thought again of Italy, and went to Valencia to\r\nplace himself under Córdoba, but once more illness overtook him, this\r\ntime accompanied by destitution, and he returned to Medellin somewhat\r\nsobered.[61] Thus another year was idled away; but notwithstanding\r\nhis follies, the youthful cavalier, who was now nineteen, displayed\r\nmany fine qualities. As he approached manhood his health improved, and\r\nform and features became more pleasing. Though proud in his bearing,\r\nand of quick perceptions, and high-spirited in temper, he sought to\r\nschool his tongue, and to practise discretion in the use of his sword.\r\nNative to him were generosity and amiability. The qualities of his\r\nheart were noble; the vices were those of his time and station. Yet\r\nhe lacked the moral fibre which should be interwoven with the good\r\nimpulses of every rich, sensitive nature, and this want could not be\r\nmade up by repeating prayers and singing psalms, wherein Gomara\r\ndescribes him as efficient.\r\n\r\nThe pinching economy to which Cortés was reduced made his present\r\nfrequent visions of the Indies appear only the brighter; and when,\r\nin 1504, a fleet of five ships was announced to sail for Española,\r\nhe determined to delay no longer. With little else than his father’s\r\nblessing he proceeded to Seville, and took passage with Alonso\r\nQuintero, master of one of the vessels, who fancied himself shrewder\r\nthan other men, and shrewder than he was. Thinking to overreach his\r\nbrother captains in whose company he sailed, and to secure at Española\r\nthe first market for his merchandise, he stole forth one night from\r\nthe Canary Isles, where the squadron had touched for supplies. A gale\r\ndismasted his vessel on reaching the open sea, and sent him back\r\nto port. The others agreed to await his repairs, which generosity\r\nQuintero repaid by seeking a second time to take advantage of them\r\nby going before, and his treachery was a second time punished by\r\nthe winds, aided, indeed, by the pilot, who was at enmity with the\r\ncaptain, and who threw the ship from her course during the night so\r\nthat the reckoning was lost. The usual sufferings are related; and,\r\nin answer to prayer, we are told of a miraculous interposition. On\r\nGood Friday, when all hope had been abandoned, there was seen poised\r\nabove the ship a dove, which presently dropped down and rested on\r\nthe mast.[62] However this might have been, we are credibly informed\r\nthat the wind subsided and the ship proceeded on her voyage. Finally,\r\non reaching his destination, Quintero found the other ships snugly\r\nriding at anchor, their cargoes having been profitably disposed of\r\nseveral days before.\r\n\r\nThe governor being absent, his secretary, Medina, received Cortés\r\nkindly, and pointed him the common highway to fortune. “Register\r\nyourself a citizen,” he said. “Promise not to leave the island for\r\nfive years, and you shall have lands and Indians; after the expiration\r\nof your time you may go where you choose.” Cortés answered: “I want\r\ngold, not work; and neither in this island nor in any other place will\r\nI promise to remain so long.” He thought better of it, however, and on\r\nthe return of Ovando he presented himself, and was induced to settle.\r\nNot long after an Indian revolt called Diego Velazquez, lieutenant of\r\nOvando, into the field, and Cortés hastened to join the expedition.\r\nThe coolness and ability displayed in this short campaign won for him\r\nthe admiration and esteem alike of chief and comrades.[63] His reward\r\nwas an encomienda of Indians in the Daiguao country, together with\r\nthe notaryship of the new town of Azua. For the next six years he was\r\noccupied in husbandry and in official pursuits, varied by military\r\nexploits and love intrigues which kept his sword from rusting and\r\ngave him wounds which he carried through life. An abscess under the\r\nright knee, a most lucky affliction, alone prevented his joining the\r\nill-fated expedition of Nicuesa to Veragua.[64]\r\n\r\nOn assuming the direction of New World affairs as governor, in place\r\nof Ovando, Diego Colon in 1511 fitted out an expedition against Cuba,\r\nand gave the command to Velazquez, who appointed Cortés his adviser and\r\nexecutive officer,[65] a position which the latter gladly accepted,\r\ndeprived as he was of his patron Ovando, and heartily tired of the\r\nmonotony of Española. Still hidden beneath a careless exterior were the\r\ndeeper qualities of his nature, and there were yet six other years,\r\nand more of ordinary business and pleasure, before the appearance of\r\nearnest thought or great self-reliance.[66] Meanwhile Spanish women\r\nwere not numerous in the Indies, and rivalry for their favors was\r\ngreat. Cortés had escaped with light punishment many gallantries, but\r\nhe had not been settled long in Cuba before he found a more serious\r\ncase upon his hands.\r\n\r\nAmong those who had settled in Cuba was a family from Granada, Suarez\r\nby name, consisting of a widow, her son Juan, and three daughters,\r\nremarkable for their beauty. They had come with the vireyna María\r\nde Toledo, and Gomara is so ungallant as to say that their object was to\r\nsecure rich husbands.[67] Scores of hearts are laid at their feet, but\r\nthe marriage obligation is evaded by the more promising men of the\r\ncolony, for the Suarez family has a somewhat clouded reputation. In\r\none of them Velazquez takes a tender interest;, some say he marries\r\nher.[68] Cortés fancies another; Catalina is her name; he trifles with\r\nher affections, obtains her favors, promises her marriage, and then\r\nseeks to evade the issue. The brother petitions the virtuous governor,\r\nwho cannot see the sister of his love thus wronged. Velazquez orders\r\nCortés to marry Catalina. The cavalier refuses. Enmity arises between\r\nthe two men, and without difficulty Cortés is persuaded by certain\r\ndisaffected to join a cabal against the governor. Nocturnal meetings\r\nare held at the house of Cortés; and when it is determined to lay\r\ntheir fancied grievances before the authorities at Santo Domingo,\r\nCortés is chosen bearer of the complaints.[69] As he is about to\r\nembark on his perilous mission, to traverse in an open boat eighteen\r\nleagues of open ocean, the governor hears of it, seizes the envoy,\r\nand sends him in chains to the fortress. His partisans are likewise\r\nimprisoned, and active in preferring charges against them are Bermudez,\r\nthe two Velazquez, Villegas, and Juan Suarez. Friends intercede and\r\nprevent immediate hanging.[70] Cortés resolves on escape. With some\r\ndifficulty he extricates himself from his fetters, seizes the sword\r\nof the sleeping guard, forces the window, and dropping to the ground\r\ntakes refuge in the church.[71] Velazquez, enraged at the escape,\r\nyet not daring to violate the privilege of sanctuary, resorts to\r\nartifice. Introducing some soldiers into the chapel through a small\r\ndoor in the rear, the blushing Catalina is stationed at a distance\r\nbefore the sacred edifice as a decoy. The lover sees her; the dear\r\ngirl wishes to speak with him, but her maidenly modesty forbids her\r\nnearer approach. Cortés rushes forward to clasp her in his arms,\r\nonly to be seized from behind, and placed under a strong guard in\r\nthe hold of a vessel bound for Española, where, in company with the\r\nother conspirators, he is to undergo trial.[72]\r\n\r\nSympathy for Cortés increases with his misfortunes, and aid is\r\nfurnished for a second escape. The shackles are removed, and\r\nexchanging clothes with an attendant, he mounts the upper deck,[73]\r\nstrolls carelessly about watching his opportunity until he gains\r\nthe skiff; then cutting loose the boat of another vessel near by, to\r\nprevent pursuit, he pulls lustily toward Baracoa. The boat becomes\r\nunmanageable, he plunges into the water, swims ashore, and once more\r\ngains the sanctuary.[74]\r\n\r\nCortés was sensible enough now to perceive that he had involved\r\nhimself more deeply than a trifling love affair would justify, and\r\nthat possibly he might best rid himself of the charming Catalina\r\nby marrying her. Once determined on this course, he called to him\r\nthe brother, Juan Suarez, and informed him of his doleful resolve.\r\nMeanwhile the constant importunities of powerful friends, and the\r\nneed of Cortés’ services in an Indian outbreak, induced Velazquez\r\nto make overtures of reconciliation; but Cortés met him in a haughty\r\nspirit, and surrounding the church with a guard he went his way to the\r\nwars. Notwithstanding the cavalier had made up his mind to drink the\r\nmarriage-draught, he would none of the governor in it; or if he must,\r\nthe reconciliation should be accomplished after his own fashion. No\r\nsooner had the governor departed than Cortés directed Juan Suarez,\r\nwith lance and cross-bow, to await him at a certain place. Escaping\r\nthe guard during the night, Cortés joined Suarez, and proceeded to\r\nthe plantation where Velazquez was quartered. The governor, who was\r\nengaged in looking over some books of accounts, was not a little\r\nstartled when Cortés knocked at the open door and entered. “Is it\r\nmurder the man means with arms in his hands, and at this hour?”\r\nwas his thought, as he gave the visitor a nervous welcome. “Command\r\nthat no one come near me!” exclaimed Cortés, “else I will put this\r\npike through him. And now, if my excellent and brave captain, Señor\r\nVelazquez, has aught against me, let him speak. I am here to answer.”\r\nSo sweet was the mutual forgiveness that followed, that in the morning\r\nthe two gentlemen were found occupying the same bed.[75] Not long\r\nafter Cortés married Catalina, and jointly with his brother-in-law\r\nreceived an encomienda of Manicarao Indians. Like a brave cavalier\r\nhe put the best face possible on the inevitable, and vowed he was as\r\npleased with his bride as if she had been a duchess.[76] Velazquez\r\nstood godfather to a child born to them, and thenceforth addressed\r\nCortés by the intimate term compadre,[77] investing him afterward with\r\nthe staff of alcalde at Santiago de Cuba.[78] For a time, however, he\r\nremained at Baracoa, where the preceding events occurred, and beside\r\nmining he was one of the first upon the island to engage in stock\r\nraising. Thus by diligence and judicious investments he was enabled\r\nto rise from poverty, as well as from profligacy, and to stand ready\r\nto embrace the golden opportunity fortune was now about to offer him.\r\n\r\nThe soft white snow gently dropped upon the mountain top is forged\r\nby alternate thawings and freezings into hard, rasping glaciers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [54] Indeed, to make the miracle perfect in all its details,\r\n     a little warping of the facts is perhaps allowable. So\r\n     when the zealous chroniclers bring into the world the same\r\n     year, the same day, even the self-same hour, these two\r\n     great champions for the souls of men, we should not be too\r\n     critical, though in truth there were two years difference\r\n     in their ages. ‘Y así, no carece de misterio que el mismo\r\n     año que Lutero nació en Islebio,’ that is to say Eisleben,\r\n     ‘villa de Sajonia, nació Hernando Cortés en Medellin, villa\r\n     de España; aquel para turbar el mundo y meter debajo de la\r\n     bandera del demonio a muchos de los fieles que de padres y\r\n     abuelos y muchos tiempos atras eran católicos, y este para\r\n     traer al gremio de la Iglesia infinita multitud de gentes\r\n     que por años sin cuento habian estado debajo del poder de\r\n     Satanás envueltos en vicios y ciegos con la idolatría.’\r\n     _Mendieta_, _Hist. Ecles._, 174-5. Pizarro y Orellana will\r\n     not be outdone by any one in zeal or mendacity. ‘Nació este\r\n     Ilustre Varon el dia mismo que aquella bestia infernal,\r\n     el Perfido Heresiarca Lutero, salió al mundo.’ _Varones\r\n     Ilvstres_, 66. Bernal Diaz is the first authority on the\r\n     question of age. ‘En el año que passamos con Cortés dende\r\n     Cuba,’ he writes _Hist. Verdad._, 238, ‘a la Nueva España,\r\n     fue el de quinientos y diez y nueue años, y entonces\r\n     solia dezir estando en conversacion de todos nosotros los\r\n     compañeros que con él passamos, que auia treynta y quatro\r\n     años, y veynte y ocho que auian passado hasta que murio,\r\n     que son sesenta y dos años.’ While agreeing with Bernal\r\n     Diaz in the date of Cortés’ death, December 2, 1547, Gomara says\r\n     he was then sixty-three. From his false premise Mendieta\r\n     elaborates a comparison between Luther and Cortés, dwelling\r\n     with pious pathos on the holocaust of human victims offered\r\n     up at the consecration of the great Aztec temple at Mexico,\r\n     which deed, he coolly states, was committed on the day\r\n     Cortés was born. For the facts, see _Bancroft’s Native\r\n     Races_, v. 5, 439-40. Without taking the trouble to test\r\n     Mendieta’s statement, Torquemada, i. 340-1, carries the\r\n     miraculous still further. Following the heaven-descended\r\n     Cortés in his piratical raid on Mexico, he sees the hand of\r\n     God in the finding of Aguilar, who, like Aaron, was to be\r\n     the mouthpiece of his chief, in the alliances with native\r\n     states, and in the great victories and hair-breadth escapes\r\n     of the conqueror, fighting under the banner of the cross.\r\n\r\n     [55] According to the _Testimonio de Hidalguia de Cortés_,\r\n     in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, iv. 238-9, the names of the mother’s\r\n     parents were Diego Altamirano and Leonor Sanchez Pizarro,\r\n     which would reverse her surnames, and make the son a Cortés y\r\n     Altamirano. But Gomara, _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, and\r\n     other authorities, do not accept this form. This important\r\n     document, however, the _Testimonio_, establishes the fact\r\n     that both parents were hidalgos, ‘gozando de los oficios\r\n     que gozan los hijosdalgo en ... Medellin.’ Some historians\r\n     strain themselves to make Cortés the scion of a Roman\r\n     family, or even of a king of Lombardy and Tuscany, whose\r\n     descendants entered Spain during Gothic rule. Those who\r\n     have tastes in that direction may consult _Siculus_, _Viris\r\n     Illust._, 141; _Anales de Aragon_, iii. xiv.; _Pizarro y\r\n     Orellana, Varones Ilvstres_, 67. Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv.\r\n     11, who claimed acquaintance with the family, slurs their\r\n     pretensions to high origin. ‘Ambos hijosdalgo sin raça’\r\n     is the qualification in _Sandoval_, _Hist. Carlos V._, i.\r\n     160. No doubt the parents of Cortés were respectable and\r\n     amiable people, but to attempt to make of them other than\r\n     they were is folly. ‘Catharinia namque probitate, pudicitiâ\r\n     et in conjugem amore, nulli ætatis suae feminae cessit.’ _De\r\n     Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, i. 310-11. This document refers to Martin Cortés\r\n     as ‘levis armaturae equitum quinquaginta dux fuerit,’ on\r\n     which evidence Prescott makes the man a captain when he is\r\n     only a lieutenant, which yet more clearly appears by Gomara, who\r\n     states, _Hist. Mex._, 4, that he was a ‘teniente de vna\r\n     compañia de Ginetes.’\r\n\r\n     [56] The nurse was a ‘vezina de Oliua,’ and her method\r\n     of choosing a patron was characteristic of the times. ‘La\r\n     deuocion fue echar en suertes los doze apostoles, y darle\r\n     por auogado el postrero q̄ ssliesse, y salio san Pedro. En\r\n     cuyo nõbre se dixeron ciertas missas y oraciones, con las\r\n     quales plugo a Dios q̄ sanasse.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 4.\r\n\r\n     [57] And Pizarro y Orellana, _Varones Ilvstres_, 66-69,\r\n     indulges in a lengthy dissertation upon the effect of\r\n     mothers’ milk on heroes. ‘Criole a sus pechos Doña Catalina\r\n     Pizarro su madre: y a la generosidad deste lacticinio\r\n     atribuye Marineo e Siculo su gran valor, y virtud.’\r\n\r\n     [58] Pizarro y Orellana, _Varones Ilvstres_, 67, states that\r\n     he was supported at college by Monroy and Rodriguez. It is\r\n     possible that his proud spirit chafed under this dependence,\r\n     or that he felt too deeply his position as a poor student\r\n     among the wealthy youth there congregated; or that this\r\n     aid was withdrawn owing to the turbulent character here\r\n     developed by the young man. These views find support in _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 4: ‘Boluiose a Medellin, harto o arrepentido\r\n     de estudiar, o quiça falto de dineros.’ While admitting the\r\n     want both of money and inclination for study, Torquemada,\r\n     i. 345, states that a quartan fever came on as he was\r\n     preparing for the study of law, and was the chief cause of\r\n     his leaving the college. Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 11,\r\n     gives him the honors of a bachiller, and as having studied\r\n     law, both of which statements are unlikely, considering\r\n     his short course. ‘Aprendiendo gramática’ implies a course\r\n     of study in Latin and Greek, as well as rhetoric, which it\r\n     required three years to complete. _Plan de Estudios de la\r\n     Universidad de Salamanca_, quoted by Folsom, in _Cortés’\r\n     Despatches_, 10. According to Peralta, ‘asento con un\r\n     escribano, ... y aprendió á escrebir,’ etc. in Valladolid.\r\n     _Not. Hist._, 56.\r\n\r\n     [59] Verses which were tolerably good, and even procured\r\n     him some fame. _Anales_, 220. ‘Quando hablaua con Letrados,\r\n     y hombres Latinos, respondia á lo que le dezian en Latin.’\r\n     Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 238. The combined qualities\r\n     of scholar and general have called up a not inappropriate\r\n     comparison between Cortés and Cæsar. See _Helps’ Span.\r\n     Conq._, and other authorities.\r\n\r\n     [60] Some claim him for a relative of Cortés. See _Pizarro y\r\n     Orellana_, _Varones Ilvstres_, 70; _Solis_, _Hist. Mex._, i.\r\n     45; _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 312.\r\n\r\n     [61] ‘Anduvo se a la flor del berro, aun q̄ no sin trabajos\r\n     y necessidades cerca de vn año.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 5.\r\n     ‘Squandered his means at Valencia with bad companions,’ is\r\n     the term used in _Sandoval_, _Hist. Carlos_, i. 161.\r\n\r\n     [62] Torquemada, i. 346, sees in the bird a messenger from\r\n     God to conduct safely his chosen instrument for converting\r\n     the natives of the New World. Pizarro y Orellana, _Varones\r\n     Ilvstres_, 69-70, recognizes the Holy Ghost, who assumed\r\n     this form, and comments on similar appearances elsewhere.\r\n     How goodly a thing is faith!\r\n\r\n     [63] He assisted in the pacification of Higne, Bauruco,\r\n     Daiguao, Iutagna, Jaraguá, and Amguayagua. _Cortés_,\r\n     _Memorial_, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, iv. 220.\r\n\r\n     [64] The author of _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_\r\n     directs this expedition to Cuba, after delaying it three\r\n     months in the hope of securing the services of Cortés, in\r\n     both of which statements he is in error. _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 318-19.\r\n\r\n     [65] ‘Socium et ministrum consiliorum omnium adsumit.’\r\n     _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 320. So highly did Velazquez esteem the\r\n     qualities of his friend, ‘diu multùmque Cortesium rogat,\r\n     ut secum eat: maria ac montes pollicetur, si operam ad id\r\n     bellum polliceatur.’ _Id._, 319. Las Casas, who knew Cortés\r\n     at a later time, makes him one of the two secretaries of\r\n     Velazquez, the other being Andrés de Duero; and this would\r\n     coincide with the above. Las Casas is too inconsistent to\r\n     be very reliable. On the same page he refers to Cortés as a\r\n     prudent, reticent man, and also as a prater not to be trusted\r\n     with secrets; useful to Velazquez only for his knowledge\r\n     of Latin. _Hist. Ind._, iv. 10-11. _Herrera_, dec. i., lib.\r\n     ix., cap. viii., follows Las Casas. Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 6, calls\r\n     him ‘oficial del tesorero Miguel de Passamõte, para tener\r\n     cuẽta cõ los quintos y hazienda del rey, y aun el mesmo\r\n     Diego Velazquez se lo rogo, por ser habil y diligente.’ Gomara may\r\n     have had his reasons for not connecting him too closely\r\n     with his later enemy, but he admits on this and on the\r\n     following page that Velazquez intrusted him with business\r\n     affairs of his own, which he was afterward charged with\r\n     having divulged. Among these duties was superintending\r\n     the construction of a mint and hospital. The position of\r\n     clerk to a treasurer would of course be inferior to that\r\n     of secretary to the chief of the expedition; yet if the\r\n     treasurer was as illiterate as Contador Láres, his clerk\r\n     would rank rather as deputy.\r\n\r\n     [66] ‘Era muy resabido y recatado,’ says Las Casas, ‘puesto\r\n     que no mostraba saber tanto, ni ser de tanta habilidad como\r\n     despues lo mostró en cosas árduas.’\r\n\r\n     [67] The deceased head of the family bore the name of Diego\r\n     Suarez Pacheco, the mother that of María de Marcaida, also\r\n     wrongly written Mercaida. The son, Juan Suarez, the partner\r\n     of Cortés in the Cuban encomienda, afterward settled in\r\n     Mexico. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 12-13. See also\r\n     Proceso de Marcayda, in _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 333.\r\n     Peralta, the son of Juan, gives the family a genealogy of\r\n     high order. _Not. Hist._, 57. ‘Suarez ... gente pobre.’ _Las\r\n     Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 13. ‘Doña Catalina Suarez Pacheco\r\n     (the daughter), doncella noble y recatada.’ Solis, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, i. 46, and Pizarro y Orellana, _Varones Ilvstres_,\r\n     70, also write Suarez, Herrera and Gomara, Xuarez. The latter\r\n     says three or four daughters, _Hist. Mex._, 7, but it seems\r\n     that there were four children in all. Those who write the\r\n     more common form of Suarez are more explicit, and deserve\r\n     at least equal credit with Gomara.\r\n\r\n     [68] Velazquez was married not long after his arrival in\r\n     Cuba to the daughter of Contador Cuéllar. The bride died\r\n     within the same week. _Herrera_, dec. i. lib. ix. cap.\r\n     ix. ‘Velazquez fauoreciala por amor de otra su hermana,\r\n     q̄ tenia ruin fama, y aun el era demasiado mugeril.’ _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 7. Delaporte, _Reisen_, x. 141-2, assumes\r\n     that Cortés won the love of her whom Velazquez wished to\r\n     possess; while Gordon, _Anc. Mex._, ii. 32, supposes that\r\n     the bride had been the object of Velazquez’ gallantry;\r\n     hence the trouble. Folsom, on the other hand, marries\r\n     one of the Suarez sisters to Velazquez, and calls him the\r\n     brother-in-law of Cortés. _Cortés_, _Despatches_, 9, 11-12.\r\n\r\n     [69] Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 7, insists that Velazquez had no\r\n     motive for anger except the refusal of Cortés to marry. The\r\n     meeting of conspirators at his house gave plausibility to\r\n     the charges of his enemies. By others it is even stated that\r\n     at these meetings Cortés defended the governor against the\r\n     charges of the conspirators and overruled their plots. _De\r\n     Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, i. 325-6. The preponderance of evidence, however,\r\n     is against this supposition.\r\n\r\n     [70] ‘Estando para se embarcar en una canoa de indios con\r\n     sus papeles, fué Diego Velazquez avisado y hízolo prender\r\n     y quísolo ahorcar.’ _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 11. He\r\n     was cast in the fort prison, lest the army should proclaim\r\n     him general. ‘Timebat ne si quis,’ etc. _De Rebus Gestis\r\n     Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i.\r\n     325 and 326-7.\r\n\r\n     [71] In _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 326-7, it is related that\r\n     Cortés broke the ropes holding him by means of a stick,\r\n     and filed the padlock of the chains. Seizing a bludgeon\r\n     he advanced on the sleeping jailer, resolved to break his\r\n     head if he moved. But Cristóbal de Lagos either slept or\r\n     pretended not to hear the noise as Cortés seized the sword\r\n     and shield at his head. Swinging open a small window, Cortés\r\n     slid down and hurried to the sanctuary, giving on the way\r\n     a word of cheer and advice to the conspirators who were\r\n     held within the prison.\r\n\r\n     [72] ‘Cortés ... tuuo por cierto q̄ lo embiariã a santo\r\n     Domingo o a España.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 7. There would\r\n     have been no reasons for his fears on this score, if he\r\n     possessed papers implicating Velazquez, as Gomara states.\r\n     Another version is that the alcaldes imposed a heavy sentence\r\n     on Cortés, after his capture, and that Velazquez, on being\r\n     appealed to by Duero and others, was noble-minded enough\r\n     to grant a pardon. He discharged him from his service,\r\n     however, and had him placed on board a ship for Española.\r\n     _Torquemada_, i. 348. Herrera says that Catalina lived\r\n     near the church, and while Cortés was making love to her\r\n     an alguacil named Juan Escudero, whom Cortés afterward\r\n     hanged in Mexico, came up behind him and pinioned his arms,\r\n     while the soldiers rushed to his assistance. Dec. i. lib.\r\n     ix. cap. ix.; _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. 63, etc. _Las\r\n     Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 11; _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi\r\n     Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_, i. 327-8, give minutely the\r\n     mode of capture.\r\n\r\n     [73] Broke the pump and crawled through, ‘Organum\r\n     pneumaticum,’ etc. _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 329.\r\n\r\n     [74] The current of the Macaguanigua River did not allow\r\n     him to enter it, and elsewhere the breakers would upset\r\n     the boat. Stripping himself, he tied to his head certain\r\n     documents against Velazquez, held by him as notary of the\r\n     ayuntamiento and clerk of the treasurer, and thereupon swam\r\n     ashore. He entered his house, consulted with Juan Suarez,\r\n     and reëntered the temple, armed. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     7. _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     vi. 329-30, refers to a friend of Cortés chained in the same\r\n     ship’s hold, and states that Cortés rowed ashore. On the way\r\n     to the house of Suarez he narrowly escapes a patrol. Having\r\n     secured arms, he proceeds to cheer his captive partisans,\r\n     and then enters the sanctuary. At dawn the captain of the\r\n     vessel from which Cortés escaped comes also to the temple,\r\n     to secure himself against Velazquez’ wrath, no doubt, but is\r\n     refused admission into the sacristy by his fellow-refugee,\r\n     who suspects the man, and fears that the provisions may\r\n     not outlast the siege. In _Herrera_, dec. i. lib. ix. cap.\r\n     viii., Cortés drifts about on a log and is finally cast\r\n     ashore.\r\n\r\n     [75] So the story was current at the time, and I doubt\r\n     not it contains some degree of truth, notwithstanding\r\n     Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 11-12, scouts it as a pure\r\n     fabrication. He knew both men; Velazquez as a proud chief,\r\n     exacting the deepest reverence from those around him,\r\n     and making them tremble at his frown; while Cortés was in\r\n     those days so lowly and humble as to be glad to curry favor\r\n     with the meanest servants of the governor. The good bishop\r\n     is evidently prejudiced. In _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi\r\n     Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 332-4, the\r\n     facts are a little elaborated and contradictory, as usual.\r\n     Cortés escapes the guard round the church, and reaches the\r\n     farm. ‘Halloh, señores!’ he shouts, ‘Cortés is at the door,\r\n     and salutes Señor Velazquez, his excellent and gallant\r\n     captain.’ Velazquez is astonished, yet pleased, at the\r\n     arrival of one whom he always had regarded as a friend and\r\n     beloved brother. He orders supper and bed to be prepared;\r\n     but Cortés insists that none shall approach, or he will\r\n     lance them. He demands to know what complaints there are\r\n     against him. He abhors the suspicion of being a traitor,\r\n     and will clear himself. ‘Receive me,’ he concludes, ‘in\r\n     your favor with the same good faith that I return to it.’\r\n     ‘Now I believe,’ answers Velazquez, ‘that you regard as\r\n     highly my name and fame as your own loyalty.’ They shake\r\n     hands, and Cortés now enters the house to fully explain\r\n     the misunderstanding. After supper they retire to one bed.\r\n     In the morning the messenger, Diego Orellana, arrives to\r\n     announce Cortés’ flight, and finds them lying side by side.\r\n     Cortés will not proceed with the expedition just then; but\r\n     after arranging his affairs he joins, to the delight of\r\n     the general, who follows his advice implicitly, as he had\r\n     done in former campaigns. After their victorious return\r\n     Cortés enjoys greater honors than ever. Peralta, who also\r\n     gives the story at length, states that Cortés surprised\r\n     Velazquez asleep. At the request of the governor he gave\r\n     himself up to the jailer in order to be formally released.\r\n     _Nat. Hist._, 58-62. Still Peralta is a little confused.\r\n\r\n     [76] She was received by Cortés in Mexico, after the\r\n     conquest, with great distinction; but died in about three\r\n     months after her arrival.\r\n\r\n     [77] Las Casas, who, as usual, will have a fling at Cortés,\r\n     writes: ‘Tuvo Cortés un hijo ó hija, no sé si en su mujer,\r\n     y suplicó á Diego Velazquez que tuviese por bien de se lo\r\n     sacar de la pila en el baptismo y ser su compadre, lo que\r\n     Diego Velazquez aceptó, por honralle.’ _Hist. Ind._, iv.\r\n     13. Among Cortés’ children a natural daughter by a Cuban\r\n     Indian is mentioned, _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 238,\r\n     but it is not likely that Cortés would ask the governor to\r\n     stand godfather to a natural child. The same writer makes\r\n     Velazquez the groomsman or sponsor at the marriage. ‘Fue su\r\n     padrino, quando Cortés se velò con Doña Catalina;’ _Id._, 13;\r\n     _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 109. Although compadre\r\n     is not unfrequently used as a mere term of friendship, it\r\n     is not likely to have been applied by a marriage padrino;\r\n     hence the title of co-father indicates that it originated\r\n     at the font.\r\n\r\n     [78] An office granted only to men of note and to leading\r\n     conquistadores. _Solis_, _Hist. Mex._, i. 46. It conveyed\r\n     the title of ‘muy virtuoso señor,’ the governor being called\r\n     ‘muy magnífico señor,’ _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, xii. 225, and permitted the holder to walk side by\r\n     side with the governor. _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap.\r\n     xii. ‘Auia sido dos vezes Alcalde en la Villa de Sãtiago\r\n     de Boroco, adõde era vezino: porque en aquestas tierras se\r\n     tiene por mucha honra.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     13. He does not refer to him as alcalde at Santiago de\r\n     Cuba, where the fleet is fitting out, as he clearly states.\r\n     Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 4, mentions merely that he was here\r\n     before the quarrel with Velazquez. Some writers assume that\r\n     Santiago de Cuba is the same as Santiago de Baracoa, but\r\n     Herrera, _loc. cit._, and others, observe the distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSAILING OF THE EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n1518-1519.\r\n\r\n     THE QUALITY OF LEADER DESIRED—INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED\r\n     TO HERNAN CORTÉS, COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF—THE CHARACTER OF\r\n     CORTÉS UNDERGOES A CHANGE—COST OF THE EXPEDITION—BY WHOM\r\n     BORNE—PLACES ESTABLISHED FOR ENLISTMENT—THE BANNER—CORTÉS\r\n     PUTS ON THE GREAT MAN—MORE OF HIS CHARACTER—THE SCENE AT\r\n     SANTIAGO HARBOR—THE GOVERNOR’S JESTER—DARK SUSPICIONS OF\r\n     VELAZQUEZ—DEPARTURE FROM SANTIAGO—CORTÉS AT TRINIDAD—FRESH\r\n     RECRUITS—VERDUGO RECEIVES ORDERS TO DEPOSE CORTÉS—THE\r\n     FLEET PROCEEDS TO SAN CRISTÓBAL, OR THE HABANA—REVIEW\r\n     AT GUAGUANICO—SPEECH OF CORTÉS—ORGANIZATION INTO\r\n     COMPANIES—DEPARTURE FROM CUBA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith relations so lovingly established, and with a personal knowledge\r\nof the military genius of Cortés, and the strength and versatility\r\nof his character, it would seem that here would be the first instant\r\nchoice of the governor for the command of the important expedition now\r\nin preparation. But the quality of the man required did not altogether\r\nhinge on merit. As we have seen, Velazquez required for his purpose\r\nan anomalous creation. He must be able but humble; able to command\r\nmen, and able likewise to obey his chief; honest to Velazquez, but\r\nfalse, if necessary, to all the world else. It was not an Alexander or\r\nan Alcibiades that was wanted; not so much a man as a thing: “Piper,\r\nnon homo,” as Petronius Arbiter said; pungent as pepper, and not a\r\nhuman being.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the sordid friendship of Láres and Duero prevailed\r\nwith the governor, and on the 23d of October, 1518, his instructions\r\nto Hernan Cortés, commander-in-chief of the expedition, were drawn\r\nup before the notary, Alonso de Escalante, in accordance with the\r\npermission granted by the authorities at Santo Domingo, which limited\r\nthe enterprise to exploration; the privilege to colonize depending\r\non royal favor for which Velazquez must sue in Spain.[79]\r\n\r\nOne would think that after these twenty-five years of experience\r\nthere could be found no ecclesiastic or ruler so childish as to\r\nexpect morality or humanity from the wolves of Spain let loose among\r\nthe naked and defenceless of America. And yet we find the friars of\r\nEspañola, in pursuance of the devout and high-minded views expressed\r\nby Velazquez, subscribing to instructions which enjoin Cortés to\r\nobserve a conduct befitting a Christian soldier, as if there were\r\nany reasonable hope of his doing so. He must prohibit blasphemy,\r\nlicentiousness, and gambling among his men, and on no account molest\r\nthe natives, but gently inform them of the glory of God, and of the\r\nCatholic king. Possession must be taken in Velazquez’ name and the\r\nsecrets of the country ascertained. Search must be made for Grijalva\r\nand Olid, and for the Christian captives supposed to be in Yucatan. We\r\nmight again mark the double-dealing of the governor, who discharges\r\nGrijalva for not having settled contrary to his instructions, while\r\ncharging the new commander not to seize the country, yet expecting\r\nhim to do so.[80] The instructions consist of thirty clauses, and\r\nthe document reflects no credit on the scrivener.[81]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMan and his character are subject to environment. Neither is finished\r\nuntil decay has well set in. Long before the receipt of his commission\r\nthe adolescent Cortés was a creation of the past; even the adult\r\nCortés was a different being before and after his appointment. His\r\naction now was the expression of new intuitions. Always under the\r\ninfluence of turbulent emotions, his ambition had suddenly become\r\nmore aggressive. In pure impulses, in refined feelings, in noble\r\ninstincts, he was essentially defective. He harbored no ideal of duty,\r\nsuch as we have seen in the mind of Grijalva. His code of ethics was\r\nneither broad nor catholic. And notwithstanding his great respect for\r\nreligion, so great indeed as to excite suspicion that he cared very\r\nlittle for it; notwithstanding his outward piety, and his devotion\r\nto the church, the lighter immoralities fitted him with an ease and\r\ngrace that hampered his movements not in the least. Yet for all this\r\nthe alcalde of Santiago suddenly became a great man, not in name\r\nonly, but actually; wellnigh revolutionizing the society of which\r\nhe himself was the product. To him, and to others, his commission\r\nwas a match applied to explosive material, letting loose the latent\r\nforce. The leaders of the first gulf-shore expeditions, Córdoba,\r\nGrijalva, and Cortés, present themselves before us in relatively\r\nincreasing proportions. Córdoba, the first, was least, though a most\r\ngentlemanly and kind-hearted pirate. Grijalva, though second to\r\nCortés in talents and fame, was far before him in honesty. During\r\nthe preparations which quickly followed the appointment of Cortés,\r\nthe inherent qualities of the man developed to a degree alarming\r\nalike to friends and enemies, and astonishing to himself. He found\r\nhis nature a strong one, with magnetic attractions, and an affinity\r\nwith danger. He found himself possessed of that higher courage of the\r\nmind which begets self-confidence, breeds the hero, and ends in the\r\nachievement of the uttermost. And genius was there; he began to feel\r\nit and to know it: the genius of ambition and egotism, whose central\r\nfigure was himself, an all-prevailing sentiment, before which right,\r\nreligion, humanity, and even life itself, must be subservient. His\r\nrapidly evolving will was becoming ponderous, overwhelming. Fame was\r\nbecoming to him what ambition was to Columbus; only he possessed his\r\nidea instead of being possessed by it. Sufficiently educated for the\r\npurposes of statecraft, opportunity alone was needed to enable him\r\nto turn every weapon to the furtherance of his own designs. Without\r\nattempting to pry into the occult, he now began to see things with a\r\nlarge and liberal eye. Life was assuming tremendous realities, which\r\nbridled impulse; yet it was an ordeal he believed he could face. While\r\nin sophistry he found himself equal to Euripides, he began to put\r\non bombast such as Æschylus could not have scorned, and to display\r\nan energy as sublime as that of Archilochus; yet all this time his\r\ngood sense was supplemented by graceful courtesy. All who worship\r\nthe bright wit and intellectual versatility that flatter ambition\r\nand yield unscrupulous success may henceforth bow the knee to Hernan\r\nCortés.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo sooner was his commission sealed than Cortés set himself about the\r\ntask of collecting his many requirements. His own few thousand pesos\r\nof ready money were quickly spent; then he mortgaged his estates, and\r\nborrowed to the uttermost from his friends. Velazquez was free with\r\neverything except his substance; free with his advice and ostentation,\r\nfree with the ships of others, and willing to sell to the expedition\r\nthe products of his farm at exorbitant prices. Nevertheless the\r\ninvestment to the governor, as well as to Cortés, was large, the\r\nformer furnishing some ships of his own and some money, the whole\r\ncost of vessels and outfit being about twenty thousand ducats.[82]\r\n\r\nEstablishing places of enlistment throughout the island, Cortés roused\r\nto action his many friends, both in person and by letter. At principal\r\nsettlements the expedition was proclaimed about the streets, in the\r\nking’s name, by the beating of drums and the voice of the crier. One\r\nthird of the proceeds of the adventure was promised the soldiers and\r\nsubalterns, two thirds going to the outfitters.[83] A banner of black\r\ntaffeta was embroidered with the royal arms in gold, and blue and\r\nwhite flames surrounding a red cross, and round the border it bore\r\nthe inscription, “Amici sequamur crucem, si nos habuerimus fidem in\r\nhoc signo vincemus.” Friends, let us follow the cross, and if we have\r\nfaith under this sign we shall conquer.[84]\r\n\r\nAssuming a dress and bearing more fitting a military commander,\r\nCortés threw open his doors, and by judiciously combining the frank\r\njoviality of a soldier with the liberal hospitality of a man of\r\nwealth, he rapidly drew to his adventure all the available men of the\r\nisland. There were not lacking those to sneer at this assumption of\r\npreëminence, which flaunted it so bravely with plume and medal, with\r\nmartial music and retinue, saying, here was a lord without lands.[85]\r\nBut they little knew the strength and firmness of him who, having once\r\nput on the great man, would lay the livery down but with his life.\r\nThis soldierly display, always taking to the Castilian fancy, could\r\nscarcely be called affectation, for the genius which commands success\r\nwas present, and the firmness of resolve was covered with such pleasing\r\naffability as to render its presence scarcely suspected. With his fine\r\nsoldierly qualities were financial and executive ability, and fair\r\ncommon sense, a rare combination in a Spanish cavalier. While loving\r\nadventure he did not altogether hate ideas. His world now spread\r\nitself before him, as divided into two unequal classes, those that use\r\nothers, and those that are used by others, and he resolved himself\r\nforever into the former category. Like Diogenes, though enslaved at\r\nCrete, Cortés felt that if he could do one thing better than another\r\nit was to command men. Coupled with this egotism was the sensible\r\nintuition that the mastery of others begins with self-mastery. Indeed\r\nhis command over himself, as well as over others, was most remarkable.\r\n“By my conscience!” was a favorite oath, which implies not brutal\r\npassion. At times a swelling vein in the forehead, and another in the\r\nthroat, indicated rising anger, manifested also by a peculiarity of\r\nthrowing off his cloak; but the voice would remain decorous, and the\r\nwords seldom passed beyond a “Mal pese á vos!” May it bear heavily upon\r\nyou. To the insolent soldier, whom we shall often find overstepping\r\nthe bounds of prudence, he would merely say, “Be silent!” or “Go,\r\nin God’s name, and be more careful if you would escape punishment.”\r\nEqually composed in argument, he wielded his persuasive powers to\r\ntheir best advantage. Rio de Avenida, the Rushing River, was at one\r\ntime a nickname, and later he affected long hair and lawsuits. At the\r\ngaming-table, to which he was greatly addicted, he won or lost with\r\nequal sang-froid, ever ready with a witticism to smooth the varying\r\ncourse of fortune. Though he did not hesitate as gay Lothario to invade\r\nthe family of another, most unreasonably he was very jealous lest his\r\nown family should be invaded. While liberal to friend or mistress,\r\nand ready to sacrifice almost anything to gain an object, he was not\r\nalways regarded as over-generous by his men, too many of whom were\r\nof that class, however, that nothing would satisfy. Although a fair\r\neater, he drank but little, and confined himself to simple diet. This\r\nmoderation also extended to dress, which, before his elevation, was\r\nnot only neat but tasteful in its rich simplicity, ornamented with\r\nfew but choice jewels, and with little diversity. A love of pomp,\r\nhowever, developed with his rising fortunes, more particularly in\r\nthe way of showy residences and a large retinue, which accorded well\r\nwith the courtly manners native to the Spaniard claiming noble blood.\r\nCervantes says that in the army even the niggardly become prodigal.\r\n\r\nCortés found the way of throwing into his cause not only himself, but\r\nothers, in some respects as able as himself. His liberal measures\r\nand enthusiasm became infectious, and brought to enrolment wealthy\r\nvolunteers, who furnished not only their own outfit, but helped\r\nto provide others.[86] Within a short time there joined over three\r\nhundred men, among them some high in the service and confidence of\r\nthe governor—instance, Francisco de Morla his chamberlain, Martin\r\nRamos de Láres a Basque, Pedro Escudero, Juan Ruano, Escobar, and\r\nDiego de Ordaz mayordomo of Velazquez, and instructed by him to watch\r\nproceedings and secretly report.\r\n\r\nThe harbor of Santiago at this time presented a busy scene. There\r\nwere the hurrying to and fro of laborers and recruits, the clang of\r\ncarpenters’ hammers upon ships undergoing repairs, the collecting of\r\ngoods, and the loading of vessels. Every day the landing was enlivened\r\nby the presence of the governor, often arm-in-arm with his most\r\ndutiful and compliant captain-general, surrounded by gayly dressed\r\nattendants and followed by half the town. On one of these visits of\r\ninspection, while engaged in friendly conversation respecting the\r\nprogress of affairs, the Governor’s jester, Francisquillo, who was\r\npresent, as usual, performing his antics before his master, cried\r\nout, “Ah, friend Diego!” Then to Cortés, “And how fares our brave\r\ncaptain, he of Medellin and Estremadura? Be careful, good master, or\r\nwe shall soon have to beat the bush for this same Cortés.” Velazquez\r\nlaughed heartily, and turning to his companion exclaimed, “Compadre,\r\ndo you hear this fool?” “What, señor?” replied Cortés, pretending\r\npreoccupation. “He says you will run away with our fleet,” replied\r\nVelazquez. “Pay no attention to the knave, your worship; I am very\r\nsure these infamous pleasantries never emanated from his mad brain,”\r\nrejoined Cortés, deeply chagrined. And ere the laugh died away on\r\nthe lips of the governor his timid breast was chilled by fearful\r\nforebodings. What if it were true, thought Velazquez, and this fellow,\r\nwhom I have lifted from his low estate, should declare for himself\r\non reaching New Spain? Then he called to mind his late quarrel with\r\nCortés, and the courage, energy, and determination displayed by\r\nthe latter throughout. The governor trembled when he thought of it.\r\nAbout him were enough of the disappointed only too ready to fan these\r\nsuspicions into a flame.[87]\r\n\r\nI regret having to spoil a good story; but the truth is, the drama\r\nreported by Bartolomé Las Casas, and reiterated by Herrera and\r\nPrescott, was never performed. It tells how Cortés put to sea,\r\nPrescott asserts the very night after the jester’s warning; and that\r\nin the morning, when the governor, early roused from his bed, rushed\r\ndown to the landing with all the town at his heels, Cortés returned\r\npart way in an armed boat and bandied words with him. Beside being\r\nimprobable, almost impossible, this version is not sustained by\r\nthe best authorities.[88] The fact is, some time elapsed, after the\r\nsuspicions of the governor had first been aroused, before the sailing\r\nof the fleet, during which interval Grijalva with his ships returned.\r\n\r\nGomara states that Velazquez sought to break with Cortés and send\r\nonly Grijalva’s vessels, with another commander; but to this Láres and\r\nDuero, whose advice was asked by the governor, made strong objection,\r\nsaying that Cortés and his friends had spent too much money now to\r\nabandon the enterprise, which was very true; for like the appetite of\r\nAngaston which came with eating, the more Cortés tasted the sweets of\r\npopularity and power, the more stomach he had for the business. And\r\nthe more the suspicions of the governor grew, the greater were the\r\ncaptain-general’s assurances of devotion, and the firmer became the\r\ndetermination of Cortés and his followers to prosecute this adventure,\r\nin which they had staked their all.[89]\r\n\r\nWarned by Láres and Duero of every plot, Cortés hurried preparations,\r\nsending friends to forage, and shipping stores with the utmost\r\ndespatch, meanwhile giving secret orders for all to be ready to\r\nembark at a moment’s notice. Finally, the hour having come, on the\r\nevening of the 17th of November, with a few trusty adherents, Cortés\r\npresented himself before the governor, and politely took his leave.\r\nIt fell suddenly on Velazquez, in whose eyes all movements relating\r\nto the expedition had of late become the manœuvres of men conspired\r\nto overreach him. But having neither the excuse nor the ability to\r\nstop the expedition he let the officers depart.\r\n\r\nBy playing with the devil one soon learns to play the devil. From\r\nthe governor’s house Cortés hastened to the public meat depository,\r\nseized and added to his stores the town’s next week’s supply, and\r\nleft the keeper, Fernando Alfonso, a gold chain, all he had remaining\r\nwherewith to make payment.[90] It was a dull, dry, gray November\r\nmorning, the 18th, very early, after mass had been said, when the\r\nsquadron, consisting of six vessels, sailed out of Santiago harbor\r\namidst the vivas of the populace and the inward cursings of the\r\ngovernor.[91] But of little avail was Velazquez’ remorse; for Cortés\r\ncarried no Æolian wind-bags to drive him back from his destination.\r\n\r\nDespatching one of the vessels to Jamaica[92] for provisions, Cortés\r\ntouched at Macaca for further supplies, and thence steered for\r\nTrinidad, where he was received with demonstrations of enthusiasm by\r\nthe alcalde mayor, Francisco Verdugo brother-in-law of Velazquez, and\r\nby other hidalgos, who placed their houses at his disposal. Raising\r\nhis standard before his quarters, he proclaimed the expedition and\r\ninvited volunteers, as he had done at Santiago. Soon his force was\r\naugmented by over one hundred of Grijalva’s men. Here also joined\r\nseveral captains and hidalgos, afterward famous in New Spain adventure.\r\nThere were the five brothers Alvarado, Alonso de Ávila, Gonzalo Mejía\r\nafterward treasurer at Mexico, Cristóbal de Olid, Alonzo Hernandez\r\nPuertocarrero cousin of the count of Medellin, Gonzalo de Sandoval\r\nwho became so great a friend of Cortés, Juan Velazquez de Leon a\r\nrelative of the governor, and others.[93] From the plantations of\r\nSanti Espíritu and elsewhere came many. This Cortés beheld with proud\r\nsatisfaction, and welcomed these important acquisitions with martial\r\nmusic and peals of artillery.\r\n\r\nIn seeking supplies Cortés paid little heed to rights of property, so\r\nlong as he obtained what he needed; he was subsequently not a little\r\nproud of his success. “By my faith,” he boasts in Spain in 1542, “but\r\nI did play the corsair genteelly.” Among the arbitrary purchases was\r\nthat of a vessel from Jamaica laden with provisions for the mines,\r\nfor which the owner might accept promissory notes or nothing.[94]\r\nAnother vessel from the same place, on the same mission, Cortés sent\r\nOrdaz to seize and convey to Cape San Antonio, or perhaps to San\r\nCristóbal where we afterward find him, there to await the fleet.\r\nThis captain, it will be remembered, was the spy of Velazquez, and\r\nto him, therefore, rather than to another, was given this mission,\r\nto prevent his watching proceedings at Trinidad. The commander of\r\nthe seized vessel was Juan Nuñez Sedeño, who was induced to join the\r\nexpedition.[95] Meanwhile in the breast of Velazquez was stirred afresh\r\nthe poison of jealousy by an astrologer, one Juan Millan, employed by\r\nthe enemies of Cortés to work on the fears of the governor. The result\r\nwas the arrival at Trinidad, in hot haste, of two messengers from the\r\ngovernor, with orders for Verdugo to detain the fleet, the command\r\nof which had been transferred to Vasco Porcallo. Moreover, all the\r\nretainers of Velazquez were called upon to aid in deposing Cortés. It\r\nwas no difficult matter, however, for Cortés to persuade Verdugo of\r\ntwo things: first, that there were no grounds for Velazquez’ fears,\r\nand secondly, if there were, force would now avail him nothing. So\r\nstrong was Cortés in his position that he could easily lay the town\r\nin ashes should its authorities attempt to interfere in his purposes.\r\nTaking one of the messengers, Pedro Lasso, into his service, by the\r\nother Cortés wrote Velazquez, in language most respectful, begging\r\nhim to believe that he would always be true to his God, his king,\r\nand his dear friend and governor. In like notes the robin and the\r\nscreech-owl muffle their voices when danger is near, so as to conceal\r\nthe distance, and make themselves seem far away. Thus passed twelve\r\ndays, according to Bernal Diaz, at Trinidad, when one of the vessels\r\nwas despatched to the north side of the island for supplies, and the\r\nfleet departed for San Cristóbal, then Habana,[96] while Pedro de\r\nAlvarado, with fifty soldiers and all the horses, proceeded thither\r\noverland, adding to their number at the plantations on the way.\r\n\r\nOne night during the voyage to San Cristóbal, the flag-ship was\r\nseparated from the other vessels and stranded on a reef near Isla\r\nde Pinos. With skill and promptness Cortés transferred the contents\r\nin small boats to the shore, set free the lightened vessel, and,\r\nreloading, joined his captains at San Cristóbal. This accident delayed\r\nhim seven days, during which time there was no small stir among his\r\nmen at San Cristóbal as to who should command the fleet in case its\r\ncaptain-general failed to appear. Conspicuous among these questioners\r\nwas Ordaz, who claimed precedence as Velazquez’ representative.\r\nBut the arrival of the commander put an end to the controversy and\r\nspread unbounded joy throughout the armada. Landing, he accepted\r\nthe hospitality of Pedro Barba, lieutenant of Velazquez. Among those\r\nwho joined him here were Francisco Montejo, the future conqueror of\r\nYucatan, and Diego de Soto, who in Mexico became the mayordomo of\r\nCortés. Again the commander rid himself of Ordaz by sending him with\r\na vessel to the plantations near Cape San Antonio, there to await\r\nthe fleet. The artillery was landed and cleaned; the cross-bows were\r\ntested and the firelocks polished. Cotton armor was secured. More\r\nprovisions being required, Quesada, the Episcopal tithe-collector,\r\ncontributed his stock.\r\n\r\nWarranted, as he thought, by his success and prospects, and well\r\naware of the effect on the Spanish mind of some degree of ostentation\r\nand military display, Cortés put on the paraphernalia of still\r\ngreater leadership, and appointed a chamberlain, a chief butler, and\r\na mayordomo, in the persons of Rodrigo Rangel, Guzman, and Juan de\r\nCáceres, which pomp he ever after maintained.[97] Gaspar de Garnica\r\nnow arrived with letters from Velazquez to Barba, Ordaz, Leon, and\r\nothers, ordering and entreating them to stop the fleet, arrest Cortés,\r\nand send him a prisoner to Santiago. It was of no avail, however.\r\nSoldiers, officers, even Barba himself, were enthusiastic for Cortés,\r\nwho once more wrote the governor, in terms as courteous as they were\r\ncostless, and shortly afterward, on the 10th of February, 1519, the\r\nfleet again set sail.[98] Guaguanico, on the north side of Cape San\r\nAntonio, was the place appointed for muster and apportionment.[99]\r\nMeanwhile Pedro Alvarado was sent forward with sixty soldiers in\r\nthe _San Sebastian_ to bring Ordaz to the rendezvous, but driven by\r\na gale beyond his goal and near to Yucatan, he thought it useless\r\nto return, and so proceeded to Cozumel Island, where he arrived two\r\ndays before the others. The expedition consisted of twelve vessels,\r\nthe flag-ship or capitana of one hundred tons, three others of\r\nfrom sixty to eighty tons, and the rest small brigantines and open\r\ncraft, including a transport commanded by Ginés Nortes. The soldiers\r\nnumbered five hundred and eight, and the sailors one hundred and nine,\r\nincluding officers and pilots. The priests present were Juan Diaz and\r\nBartolomé de Olmedo, of the Order of Mercy. Under Juan Benitez and\r\nPedro de Guzman were thirty-two crossbowmen; thirteen men only carried\r\nfirelocks, the rest being armed with swords and spears. The artillery\r\nconsisted of ten bronzed guns and four falconets, and was in charge of\r\nFrancisco de Orozco, aided by Mesa Usagre, Arbenga, and others. About\r\ntwo hundred Cuban Indians, together with some native women and negro\r\nslaves, were brought for service, despite the prohibitory clause in\r\nthe instructions. Sixteen horses receive the minute description and\r\nglowing encomium of the soldier Diaz, and play an important part in\r\nthe coming campaign. The supplies included some five thousand tocinos,\r\nor pieces of salt pork, six thousand loads of maize and yucca, fowl,\r\nvegetables, groceries, and other provisions. For barter were beads,\r\nbells, mirrors, needles, ribbons, knives, hatchets, cotton goods,\r\nand other articles.[100]\r\n\r\nThe force was divided into eleven companies, each under a captain\r\nhaving control on sea and land. The names of the captains were Alonso\r\nHernandez Puertocarrero, Alonso de Ávila, Diego de Ordaz, Francisco\r\nde Montejo, Francisco de Morla, Escobar, Juan de Escalante, Juan\r\nVelazquez de Leon, Cristóbal de Olid, Pedro de Alvarado, and Cortés,\r\nwith Anton de Alaminos as chief pilot.[101]\r\n\r\nFrom this list it will be seen that those but lately regarded as\r\nof the Velazquez party received their full share in the command.\r\nThis cannot be attributed so much to the captain-general’s sense of\r\nfairness, which forbade him to take advantage of interests voluntarily\r\nintrusted to his care, as to a studied policy whereby he hoped to win\r\nfor his purposes certain men of influence, whom it would, for that\r\nmatter, have been dangerous to remove.\r\n\r\nBefore the review, Cortés addressed his soldiers in a speech as shrewd\r\nand stirring as that of Marcius at Corioli. Pointing to the thousands\r\nof unbaptized, he awakened their religious zeal; dwelling on the\r\ngrandeur of the undertaking, he stimulated their ambition; referring\r\nto the vast wealth these lands contained, he excited their cupidity.\r\nGreater and richer lands than all the Spanish kingdoms, he called\r\nthem, and inhabited by strange races, only awaiting submission to\r\ntheir invincible arms. Their whole fortune was invested in the fleet\r\nthat carried them; but who would regret so trifling an expenditure\r\nwhen compared with the glorious results to follow? They were setting\r\nout upon a career of conquest in the name of their God, who had always\r\nbefriended the Spanish nation; and in the name of their emperor, for\r\nwhom they would achieve greater deeds than any ever performed. Riches\r\nlay spread before them; but like good and brave men they must look\r\nwith him to the higher and nobler reward of glory. “Nevertheless,”\r\nhe archly added, “be true to me, as am I to you, and ere long I will\r\nload you with wealth such as you have never dreamed of. I will not\r\nsay it is to be won without hardships; but who of you are afraid?\r\nWe are few, but we are brave. Let us therefore on with the work so\r\nwell begun, joyously and confidently to the end!”[102] There is no\r\npassion so artful as avarice in hiding itself under some virtue.\r\nSometimes it is progress, sometimes patriotism, but its warmest cloak\r\nhas ever been religion. There is a double profit to the devotee whose\r\nreligion gratifies his avarice, and whose avarice is made a part of\r\nhis religion.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of February 18th mass was said, the campaign standard\r\nblessed, and Saint Peter invoked, whereupon the prows were pointed\r\ntoward the islands of the west. All the vessels were to follow the\r\nflagship, whose light should be their guide by night; in case of\r\nseparation they were to steer for Cape Catoche and thence proceed to\r\nCozumel.[103]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [79] ‘Fray Luys de Figueroa, fray Alonso de santo Domingo, y\r\n     fray Bernaldino Mãçenedo, q̄ eran los gouernadores, dieron\r\n     la licencia para Fernando Cortés como capitan y armador cõ\r\n     Diego Velazquez.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 12. The Fathers\r\n     no doubt required to know the name of the commander. ‘His\r\n     litteris Cortesius confirmatus,’ is the statement in _De\r\n     Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, i. 344, in reference to their permit. This authority\r\n     intimates that Salcedo, at a later date probably, obtained\r\n     license from the Fathers for warfare in Yucatan and for\r\n     the settlement of the mainland, but this is not confirmed\r\n     anywhere. _Id._, 350.\r\n\r\n     [80] Evidently Velazquez desired his captains to disobey\r\n     instructions and colonize. He could not officially authorize\r\n     them to do so, not having as yet received permission from\r\n     Spain. Neither Velazquez nor Cortés had any intention\r\n     in this instance of confining this enterprise to trade,\r\n     or protecting the natives, or imposing morality upon the\r\n     men. It was well understood by all that licentiousness and\r\n     plunder were to be the reward for perils to be undergone.\r\n     ‘Atque etiam quod Grijalvae prætentâ causa auxilii ferendi\r\n     quod Alvaradus postulabat, ire licebat,’ is the pointed\r\n     observation in _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 343-4. Bernal Diaz, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 13, refers to promises of Indian repartimientos\r\n     in the new regions as an inducement for volunteers. Cortés’\r\n     statement at Vera Cruz, that he had no order to settle,\r\n     means nothing in view of the motives then actuating him.\r\n     Secret agreements between governors and lieutenants for\r\n     defrauding the crown and promoting their own aims were\r\n     only too common; and this is overlooked by those who trust\r\n     merely to the instructions for arguments on this point.\r\n\r\n     [81] The full text of the instructions is to be found in\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas, Col. Doc._, xii. 225-46; _Col.\r\n     Doc. Inéd._, i. 385, 406; _Alaman_, _Disert._, i. App. ii.\r\n     1-27, with notes, reproduced in _Zamacois_, _Hist. Méj._,\r\n     ii. 791-815. The Muñoz copy, given in _Prescott’s Mex._,\r\n     iii. 434-9, preserved the original spelling in the preamble,\r\n     but the clauses are abbreviated, though Prescott does not\r\n     appear to be aware of it.\r\n\r\n     [82] The ownership of the expedition has been a moot\r\n     question, some authors regarding it as pertaining chiefly\r\n     to Velazquez, while others accord it wholly to Cortés and\r\n     his friends. According to Gomara, after receiving the vessel\r\n     brought by Alvarado, and another provided by Velazquez,\r\n     Cortés, aided by his friends, bought two large and two small\r\n     vessels before leaving Santiago; and at least two more were\r\n     bought after this with bills forced upon the owners. The\r\n     rest of the fleet appears to have been made up from the\r\n     transport spoken of and from Grijalva’s vessels. The latter\r\n     is to be regarded as Velazquez’ contribution, for in the\r\n     testimony before the royal council in Spain, Montejo, the\r\n     trusted friend of the commander, declares that on delivering\r\n     them over to the governor he received the order to join\r\n     Cortés, with the vessels, of course. His statements, and\r\n     those of the captain Puertocarrero, confirmed by the letter\r\n     of the ayuntamiento of Villa Rica to the emperor, agree\r\n     that, from their own observations and the accounts given by\r\n     others, Cortés must have contributed not only seven vessels,\r\n     but expended over 5000 castellanos on the outfit, beside\r\n     procuring goods and provisions, while Velazquez furnished\r\n     only one third, chiefly in clothes, provisions, wines, and\r\n     other effects, which he sold through an agent to the company,\r\n     the witnesses included, at exorbitant prices. Montejo had\r\n     heard that Velazquez contributed three vessels, but whether\r\n     these were exclusive of Grijalva’s fleet is not clear. He\r\n     is also supposed to have lent Cortés 2000 castellanos, and\r\n     to have given twelve or thirteen hundred loads of bread,\r\n     and 300 tocinos, beside 1800 castellanos in goods, to be\r\n     sold to the party at high prices. Every other supply was\r\n     furnished by Cortés, who maintained the whole force without\r\n     touching the ship’s stores, while remaining in Cuba, no\r\n     doubt. _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i. 487-90. Puertocarrero adds that\r\n     Cortés’ liberality to men in advancing means and outfits\r\n     was generally admitted. He himself had received a horse\r\n     from the commander. He gives a list of the outrageously\r\n     high prices charged by Velazquez for his supplies. _Id._,\r\n     491-5. Another member of the expedition states that Cortés\r\n     furnished seven vessels, and Velazquez three, two more\r\n     belonging to the latter joining the fleet afterward. Cortés\r\n     paid for all the outfit. Extract appended to _Carta del\r\n     Ayunt. de V. Cruz_, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i. 419-20: ‘Casi\r\n     las dos partes ... á su (Cortés) costa, asi en navios como en\r\n     bastimentos de mar.’ ‘Todo el concierto de la dicha armada\r\n     se hizo á voluntad de dicho Diego Velazquez, aunque ni puso\r\n     ni gastó él mas de la tercia parte de ella.... La mayor\r\n     parte de la dicha tercia parte ... fué emplear sus dineros\r\n     en vinos y en ropas y en otras cosas de poco valor para nos\r\n     lo vender acá (V. Cruz) en mucha mas cantidad de lo que á él\r\n     le costó.’ _Carta de la Justicia de Veracruz, 10 de julio,\r\n     1519_, in _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 8; _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, xiv. 37. Claiming to have no ready money of\r\n     his own, Velazquez took for the expedition 1000 castellanos\r\n     from the estate of Narvaez in his charge. _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 12-13. ‘Salió de la Isla de Cuba ... con quince\r\n     navíos suyos.’ _Cortés_, _Memorial_, 1542, in _Cortés_,\r\n     _Escritos Sueltos_, 310. Peter Martyr assumes that Cuban\r\n     colonists furnished the fleet with the governor’s consent,\r\n     and elected Cortés commander. Dec. iv. cap. vi. Solis,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, i. 61, considers that Velazquez held only a\r\n     minor share in the expedition. Montejo stated in a general\r\n     way that he spent all his fortune on joining the expedition.\r\n     _Cent. Am._, 1554-55, 127-30, in _Squiers MS._ In _De Rebus\r\n     Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_ it is asserted that Cortés\r\n     expended 6000 pesos of his own, and 6000 ducats borrowed\r\n     money, beside what Velazquez lent him; his expenditures\r\n     being in all 15,000 pesos. Velazquez gave not one real, but\r\n     merely sold goods at exorbitant figures, or made advances\r\n     at a high interest, even the vessels provided by him being\r\n     transferred to the commander under an expensive charter.\r\n     ‘Sunt pretereà, multi Hispani viri boni qui et nunc vivunt,\r\n     et qui cum ea classis de qua agimus, apparabatur, aderant.\r\n     Hi in hujus causæ defensione, cujus apud Consilium Regium\r\n     Indicum Cortesius est accusatus, testes jurati asserunt\r\n     Velazquium nihil omnino ex propriâ facultate in Cortesii\r\n     classem impendisse.’ This would indicate that Montejo and\r\n     Puertocarrero’s testimony was confirmed by many others. The\r\n     agent, Juan Diaz, who attended to the sale of the goods\r\n     and the collection of the advances, fell in the retreat\r\n     from Mexico, and his money was lost. _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, i. 345-9. This testimony by members of the expedition\r\n     merits the foremost attention in the question, particularly\r\n     since the fewer statements on the other side are based\r\n     wholly on supposition. It is somewhat qualified, however,\r\n     by the consideration that both Montejo and Puertocarrero\r\n     were stanch friends of Cortés, and that the letter of the\r\n     ayuntamiento was prepared in his presence. It must also\r\n     be borne in mind that a goodly proportion of the share\r\n     attributed to him consisted of vessels and effects obtained\r\n     upon his credit as captain-general of the fleet, and also\r\n     in a semi-piratical manner. The statements in _Cortés_,\r\n     _Memorial_, and in _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_,\r\n     indicate, beside, a hardly warranted attempt to regard\r\n     Velazquez’ contribution chiefly as a loan to the commander\r\n     or to the party, his vessels being spoken of as chartered.\r\n     Another proportion belonged to wealthy volunteers. On the\r\n     whole, however, it may be concluded that Cortés could lay\r\n     claim to a larger share in the expedition than Velazquez;\r\n     but the latter possessed the title of being not only the\r\n     discoverer, through his captains, of the regions to be\r\n     conquered, but the projector of the expedition. Oviedo,\r\n     while believing that the fleet belonged with more right to\r\n     the governor, feels no pity for the treatment he received,\r\n     in view of his own conduct to Diego Colon. Complacently he\r\n     cites the proverb: ‘_Matarás y matarte han: y matarán quien\r\n     te matare._’ As you do unto others, so shall be done unto\r\n     you. Oviedo asserts that he has seen testimony showing that\r\n     Cortés and his men did not sail at their own expense, but\r\n     from his own statement it appears that the instructions of\r\n     Velazquez, wherein he speaks of the expedition as sent in\r\n     his name, is the chief feature in this so-called testimony;\r\n     i. 538-9. Las Casas naturally sides with Velazquez, and\r\n     estimates that he expended over 20,000 castellanos; he had\r\n     no need for, nor would he have stooped to a partnership,\r\n     at least with a man like Cortés. _Hist. Ind._, iv. 448.\r\n     Herrera, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap. xi., copies this, and\r\n     Torquemada, i. 359, reverses this figure in favor of Cortés.\r\n\r\n     [83] _Testimonio de Puertocarrero_, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i.\r\n     491. ‘Mãdo dar pregones, y tocar sus atambores, y trompetas\r\n     en nombre de su Magestad, y en su Real nombre por Diego\r\n     Velazquez para que qualesquier personas que quisiessen ir\r\n     en su compañía à las tierras nuevamente descubiertas â los\r\n     conquistar y doblar, les darian sus partes del oro plata,\r\n     y joyas que se huviesse, y encomiendas de Indios despues\r\n     de pacificada.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 13. Mark\r\n     here the promise of encomiendas to the volunteers. The\r\n     word ‘doblar’ doubtless meant to explore or to sail round\r\n     the new islands. Bernal Diaz does not fail to observe that\r\n     the royal license had not yet arrived to warrant these\r\n     proclamations.\r\n\r\n     [84] See _Landa_, _Rel. de Yuc._, 23; _Tapia_, _Rel._, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 554; Fancourt, _Hist. Yuc._,\r\n     27, leaves out the middle sentence; Gomara, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     15; Torquemada, i. 364, and others give only the Spanish\r\n     translation. Prescott says the flag was of velvet, and\r\n     attributes the sign to the _labarum_ of Constantine, which,\r\n     to say the least, is somewhat far-fetched. Bernal Diaz,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 13, places the motto upon ‘estandartes,\r\n     y vanderas labradas de oro cõ las armas Reales, y una Cruz\r\n     de cada parte, juntamente con las armas de nuestro Rey.’\r\n\r\n     [85] ‘Se puso vn penacho de plumas con su medalla de oro.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 13. ‘Tomo casa. Hizo Mesa.\r\n     Y començo a yr con armas, y mucha compañía. De que muchos\r\n     murmurauan, diziendo que tenia estado sin señorio.’ _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 13.\r\n\r\n     [86] Cortés himself was very liberal in advancing money\r\n     or necessaries. _Puertocarrero_, loc. cit. This cavalier\r\n     received a horse which Cortés bought at Trinidad with\r\n     gold fringes taken from his mantle. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 14. ‘Dio a muchos soldados ... dineros con\r\n     obligaciõ de man comun.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 12.\r\n\r\n     [87] _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 450-1; _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. iii. cap. xi. Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     13, relates the incident as having occurred on the way to\r\n     Sunday mass. The fool, whom he calls Cervantes, was walking\r\n     in front of his master and Cortés, uttering nonsense in\r\n     prose and rhyme; finally he said in a louder voice, ‘By my\r\n     faith, master Diego, a nice captain have you chosen: one\r\n     who will run away with the fleet, I warrant, for he has\r\n     courage and enterprise.’ Duero, who walked close by, sought\r\n     to check his tongue by striking at him and by shouting,\r\n     ‘Silence, fool! Don’t be knavish as well, for we know that\r\n     this pretended jest is not of thyself.’ But the jester\r\n     persisted in calling out, ‘Hail to my master Diego and his\r\n     valiant captain! I swear to thee, my master, that rather\r\n     than see thee grievously regret this foolish step I would\r\n     hie me with Cortés to those rich lands.’ It was supposed\r\n     that Velazquez’ relatives had induced the man to make these\r\n     remarks.\r\n\r\n     [88] Prescott states that Las Casas was on the island at\r\n     the time. In this he is mistaken. On the other hand, Bernal\r\n     Diaz was an eye-witness, and tells a very different story.\r\n     But the tale of the soldier is not so striking as that of\r\n     the priest, who writes from the statements of Velazquez’\r\n     friends, colored by time and distance. The final words\r\n     which passed between the governor and Cortés, according\r\n     to Las Casas, in effect were these: ‘Compadre, is this the\r\n     way you are going? A nice manner, truly, of taking leave!’\r\n     To which Cortés makes answer, ‘Pardon me, sir; there are\r\n     things which must be carried out before they are considered.\r\n     I wait your worship’s orders.’ _Hist. Ind._, iv. 451-2;\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap. xii.\r\n\r\n     [89] _Testimonio de Montejo_, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i.\r\n     437. ‘No le pudo estoruar la yda porq̄ todos le siguian:\r\n     los q̄ alli estauã, como los q̄ venian con Grijalua. Ca\r\n     si lo tentara con rigor vuiera rebuelta en la ciudad, y\r\n     aun muertes. Y como no era párte dissimulo.’ Cortés even\r\n     announced that he was going on his own account, and that the\r\n     soldiers had nothing to do with Velazquez. _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 13. But this is highly improbable. According to _De\r\n     Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, Cortés spread insinuations\r\n     against Velazquez’ greed and selfishness, commented upon his\r\n     own liberality and upon the rich prospects before them, and\r\n     thus gained the voice of his followers, so that the former\r\n     dared not attempt any overt acts. ‘Loricâ ab eo tempore\r\n     sub veste munitus, stipatusque armatis militibus, quos spe\r\n     sibi fidos amicos fecerat.’ _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i.\r\n     346-9; _Cortés_, _Memorial_, 1542, in _Cortés_, _Escritos\r\n     Sueltos_, 310. Las Casas repeats his condemnation of Gomara,\r\n     as a man who wrote only what he was told by his master. He\r\n     scouts the idea of the powerful Velazquez either needing\r\n     Cortés’ pecuniary aid or not being able to dispose of his\r\n     fleet as he wished. A humble squire, indeed, to raise his\r\n     voice against the great Velazquez, who could have taken\r\n     his bread and life at any moment! _Hist. Ind._, iv. 448-9.\r\n\r\n     [90] In his memorial to the emperor in 1542, Cortés relates\r\n     this enforced transaction quite at length. Learning that\r\n     his stock of the week had been seized, Hernan Dalonso seeks\r\n     Cortés and complains, with tears in his eyes, whereupon\r\n     he receives the gold chain, ‘de unos abrojos.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Escritos Sueltos_, 310-11; _Col. Doc. Inéd._, iv. 221.\r\n\r\n     [91] Bernal Diaz asserts that Duero and Láres were present\r\n     at the parting, and that Velazquez and Cortés several times\r\n     embraced each other and vowed eternal friendship. ‘Habuit\r\n     Cortesius cùm e Sancti Jacobi urbe et portu solvit, naves\r\n     sex; aliâ, nam septem habuit, in portu, ut sarciretur\r\n     reficereturque, relictâ.’ _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi\r\n     Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 348. This\r\n     authority believes that one of the reasons for Cortés’\r\n     hurried departure was a fear that Grijalva’s vessels might\r\n     turn up; but they had already arrived, as we have seen.\r\n     The seventh vessel, a caravel, joined Cortés at Trinidad,\r\n     with nine horses and eighty volunteers, under Francisco de\r\n     Salcedo. _Id._, 354. ‘Partiose de Santiago Barucoa ... en\r\n     seys nauios.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 13.\r\n\r\n     [92] Pedro Juarez Gallinato de Porra was sent with a\r\n     caravel under orders to take the cargo of supplies to Cabo\r\n     Corrientes or Punta de Santanton, and there await the fleet.\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 13. In _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi\r\n     Cortesii_, loc. cit., the captain is called Pedro Gonzalez\r\n     de Trujillo. He brings 1500 tocinas (salt pork), and 2000\r\n     loads cassava. ‘Mil cargas de pan cazavi, y dos mil tocinos\r\n     y muchos fasoles y aves y otras cosas.’ _Cortés_, _Memorial_,\r\n     1542, in _Id._, _Escritos Sueltos_, 311.\r\n\r\n     [93] Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 14, mentions several\r\n     more names, with occasional remarks on wealth and standing.\r\n     Puertocarrero is also written Puerto Carrero, and in the\r\n     modern form of Portocarrero. _Torquemada_ and _Oviedo_,\r\n     passim.\r\n\r\n     [94] This appears to be the same vessel referred to by Gomara\r\n     as Alonso Guillen’s, bought at Trinidad, though nothing is\r\n     of course said about the mode of payment. _Hist. Mex._, 13.\r\n     Prescott mistakes in making Sedeño the master of this vessel.\r\n\r\n     [95] Ordaz proceeded on his mission in the caravel _El\r\n     Guerho_, and returned to Trinidad in the vessel of Sedeño,\r\n     who received two thousand and more castellanos in gold\r\n     fringes, the only treasure on hand. _Cortés_, _Memorial_,\r\n     1542, in _Id._, _Escritos Sueltos_, 312. ‘Quatro mil\r\n     arrouas de pan, mil y quinientos toçinos y muchas gallinas.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 14. Bernal Diaz intimates that Sedeño\r\n     came into port of his own accord, and was induced to sell\r\n     ships and cargo. _Hist. Verdad._, 14. He was reputed the\r\n     richest man in the party. _Id._; _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     ii. 455-6; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap. xii. ‘De una\r\n     hacienda de V. M. compró al mayordomo de ella quinientas\r\n     é tantas cargas (pan)’. _Cortés_, _Memorial_, 1542, loc.\r\n     cit. The _Probanza de Lejalde_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, i. 411, contains interesting testimony as to what\r\n     goods were obtained, and how.\r\n\r\n     [96] The Habana was then situated on the south side of the\r\n     island, not on the north side, where the appellation now\r\n     obtains. Prescott and others fall into numerous blunders\r\n     by supposing the Habana of to-day to be identical with the\r\n     Habana of three hundred years ago, sending a whole fleet\r\n     far out of its way for no other purpose than to collect\r\n     provisions, which one vessel would accomplish as well.\r\n\r\n     [97] ‘Començó Cortés â poner casa, y â tratarse como señor:\r\n     y el primer Maestresala q̄ tuvo, fue vn Guzmã que luego se\r\n     muriò, ò mataron Indios.’ A different man from the later\r\n     mayordomo, Cristóbal de Guzman, who captured Quauhtemotzin\r\n     during the siege of Mexico. ‘Caceres ... fue despues de\r\n     ganado Mexico, hombre rico.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     15-16.\r\n\r\n     [98] Bernal Diaz says that Barba was one of the most\r\n     devoted to Cortés. See, also, _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. iii.,\r\n     cap. xiii. Solis details at length a public gathering, in\r\n     which the members of the expedition became highly excited\r\n     over Velazquez’ efforts to stop Cortés, and threatened\r\n     to destroy the town. He adds that a rumor of Velazquez’\r\n     coming in person to enforce his order created another\r\n     excitement. _Hist. Mex._, i. 63-6; Robertson, _Hist. Am._,\r\n     ii. 8, follows him; also Prescott. According to Las Casas,\r\n     Velazquez sends a letter to Cortés, asking him to wait for\r\n     an important communication, which he will bring in person\r\n     or send by messenger. At the same time come letters for\r\n     Ordaz and others, requesting them to seize the commander.\r\n     Ordaz accordingly invites him to a banquet on board his\r\n     vessel, with the intent of carrying him off to Santiago;\r\n     but Cortés perceives the snare and retires under pretence of\r\n     indisposition. The good bishop observes that he never knew\r\n     Velazquez evince so little sagacity as on this occasion;\r\n     nor did Ordaz behave any better. _Hist. Ind._, iv. 456-7.\r\n     Gomara has the same account, but adds that the messenger\r\n     from Velazquez came in a caravel, together with Alvarado,\r\n     Olid, Ávila, Montejo, and others of Grijalva’s party, who\r\n     had just arrived from an interview with the governor. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 14. He is evidently mixed. Torquemada, who quotes\r\n     both versions from Herrera and Gomara, places the occurrence\r\n     at Trinidad, and considers that Cortés was capable of and\r\n     right in foiling Velazquez. Bernal Diaz scouts Gomara’s\r\n     story, which is repeated in _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi\r\n     Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 355-6. Peralta\r\n     claims that his father, Suarez, pursued and slew the Indian\r\n     courier sent with orders for Luis de Medina, then with\r\n     the fleet, to assume the command. He thereupon brought the\r\n     papers to Cortés and warned him to sail away. _Nat. Hist._,\r\n     62-4. Peralta evidently upholds all his father told him.\r\n\r\n     [99] So affirms Tapia, one of the party. _Relacion_, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 555; and this is the view\r\n     of most writers. Bernal Diaz states that the review was\r\n     held at Cozumel, which may also have been the case; but\r\n     he was not present at San Antonio. A review must have been\r\n     held before the fleet set out on its voyage, in order that\r\n     captains might be appointed and receive apportionments of\r\n     men and supplies. Zamacois, _Hist. Méj._, ii. 292-3, assumes\r\n     that, owing to Alvarado’s absence, the muster was reserved\r\n     for Cozumel.\r\n\r\n     [100] ‘Tomo [Cortés] fiada de Diego Sanz tendero, vna tieda\r\n     de bohoneria en sieteciẽtos pesos de oro.’ _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 12, 14-15. This was at Santiago. This author, who,\r\n     together with Diaz, forms the main authority for the above\r\n     list, mentions only eleven vessels, but does not include\r\n     Alvarado’s. He places the Spanish force at 550 men, but, by\r\n     adding to this the sixty and odd men absent with Alvarado\r\n     from the review, the number would agree with Bernal Diaz’\r\n     figures. Thirteen vessels, two having joined at Habana as\r\n     transports; 530 infantry; twenty-four horses; 5000 loads of\r\n     maize and cassava; 2000 tocinos. _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi\r\n     Cortesii_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 356. Twelve\r\n     vessels and 500 men. _Carta del Ayunt. de V. Cruz_, in _Col.\r\n     Doc. Inéd._, i. 419-20. Fifteen vessels and 500 men, without\r\n     any Indians or negroes, says Cortés, in his _Memorial_,\r\n     1542, not venturing to admit that he had disobeyed the\r\n     royal order and his instructions in taking Cuban Indians.\r\n     _Cortés_, _Escritos Sueltos_, 310; _Col. Doc. Inéd._, iv.\r\n     220. Seven navios, three bergantines. _Oviedo_, i. 539. Nine\r\n     vessels, 550 Spaniards, two to three hundred Indians. _Las\r\n     Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 446, 457. Eleven vessels of thirty\r\n     to one hundred tons, 663 Spaniards, including thirty men\r\n     with firearms. _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._,\r\n     iv. 54; _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_, 19; _Vetancvrt_,\r\n     _Teatro Ecles._, pt. ii. 100-11; _Fancourt’s Hist. Yuc._,\r\n     26-7; _Zamacois_, _Hist. Méj._, ii. 296. Thirteen vessels,\r\n     560 persons, thirteen horses. _Tapia_, _Relacion_, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 558; Prescott, _Mex._,\r\n     i. 262, follows both Bernal Diaz and Gomara, but without\r\n     seeking to account for their differences, and thus allows\r\n     himself to exceed every other authentic estimate for the\r\n     number of the men.\r\n\r\n     [101] _Torquemada_, i. 364; Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 14, gives\r\n     the same names, except that Francisco de Salcedo stands in\r\n     the place of Alvarado. Solis, _Hist. Mex._, i. 66, mentions\r\n     eleven, including Salcedo and Nortes; Las Casas, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, iv. 453, names eight, as appointed by Velazquez.\r\n     Zamacois, _Hist. Méj._, ii. 287, leaves out Ávila, which\r\n     is certainly a mistake, based on Bernal Diaz, who includes\r\n     Ginés Nortes, the captain merely of a transport. Salcedo\r\n     joined later, at Villa Rica.\r\n\r\n     [102] Such is in substance the speech prepared by Gomara,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 15-16, well suited for the enterprise,\r\n     yet not exactly in accord with the pretended mission of\r\n     peaceful trade and exploration. Torquemada, i. 364-5, gives\r\n     it nearly in the same form, while Solis, _Hist. Mex._, i.\r\n     71-3, elaborates to suit himself.\r\n\r\n     [103] The date of departure is generally admitted to be\r\n     February 18th, but in _Cortés_, _Memorial_, 1542, is written\r\n     ‘tardó en esto [fitting out] desde dieciocho dias del mes\r\n     de Octubre ... hasta dieciocho dias del mes de Enero, del\r\n     año de diez y nueve que acabó de salir de la dicha Isla de\r\n     Cuba, del cabo de Corrientes.’ _Cortés_, _Escritos Sueltos_,\r\n     313. This is wrong, however, for the fleet could not have\r\n     left Santiago before the date of the instructions; yet it\r\n     confirms the fact that three months were spent, after leaving\r\n     Santiago, before the fleet finally left the island. Some of\r\n     the authors indicate a portion of this time, showing that\r\n     eight days were spent at Macãco and twelve at Trinidad,\r\n     leaving seventy-two days for the brief passages along the\r\n     south coast of Cuba and for the stay at San Cristóbal.\r\n\r\n     _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_, or, as the Spanish\r\n     translator entitles it, _Vida de Hernan Cortés_, giving\r\n     the fullest but also the most partial account of Cortés\r\n     up to this time, is an anonymous manuscript in Latin, of\r\n     eleven folio leaves, deposited in the Simancas archives,\r\n     whence Muñoz obtained a copy, published by Icazbalceta in\r\n     his _Coleccion de Documentos_, i. 309-57. It is in a clear\r\n     hand, with corrections and marginals, evidently by the\r\n     author. Several points indicate that it formed part of _De\r\n     Orbe Novo_, a history of America, written apparently in a\r\n     series of biographies, to judge from the reference made to\r\n     a preceding part relating to Columbus, and to later parts\r\n     on the conquest of Mexico. Muñoz expresses the opinion\r\n     that the author may be Calvet de Estrella, chronicler of\r\n     the Indies, mentioned by Nic. Antonio as the writer of the\r\n     manuscripts _De Rebus Gestis Vaccæ Castri_, in the Colegio\r\n     del Sacro Monte de Granada. This title induced him to name\r\n     the present document _De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandi Cortesii_.\r\n     The supposition is warranted by the style and by the evident\r\n     date; for references indicate that it was written during\r\n     the lifetime of several companions of Cortés. The fragment\r\n     begins with the hero’s birth and ends at his departure with\r\n     the fleet from Cuba. Although the facts related conform, as\r\n     a rule, to Gomara’s version, a number of authorities have\r\n     been consulted, some of them no longer extant, chiefly with\r\n     a view to extol the character and career of the hero, and\r\n     to elaborate incidents into tiresome prolixity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n1519.\r\n\r\n     SOMETHING OF THE CAPTAINS OF\r\n     CORTÉS—ALVARADO—MONTEJO—ÁVILA—OLID—SANDOVAL—LEON—ORDAZ—MORLA—THE\r\n     PASSAGE—THE FLEET STRUCK BY A SQUALL—ARRIVAL AT\r\n     COZUMEL—ALVARADO CENSURED—SEARCH FOR THE CAPTIVE\r\n     CHRISTIANS—ARRIVAL OF AGUILAR—HIS CHASTE ADVENTURES—THEY COME\r\n     TO TABASCO RIVER—BATTLES THERE—CONQUEST OF THE NATIVES—PEACE\r\n     MADE—TWENTY FEMALE SLAVES AMONG THE PRESENTS—THE FLEET\r\n     PROCEEDS ALONG THE SHORE—PUERTOCARRERO’S WITTICISM—ARRIVAL AT\r\n     SAN JUAN DE ULUA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the everlasting waves that bowl his ships along are discoursing to\r\nCortés of his destiny, let us make the acquaintance of his captains,\r\nsome of whom are to play parts in the Anáhuac amphitheatre secondary\r\nonly to his own.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was the fiery and impetuous Pedro de Alvarado, a hero\r\nof the Achilles or Sir Lancelot school, strong and symmetrical as\r\na goddess-born; haughty, choleric, sometimes stanch and generous;\r\npassionate in his loves and hates, with the usual mixture of license,\r\nloyalty, and zeal for the church. He had not eyes to see, from where\r\nhe stood in the warfare of his day, at once the decline of the fiercer\r\nbarbarism and the dawn of a truer and gentler heroism. Already we\r\nhave discovered flashes of temper and tendencies to treachery that\r\ndisplay his character by too sulphurous a flame; but we shall find\r\nin him much to admire as conquistador and governor.\r\n\r\nAlvarado was about the age of Cortés, Bajadoz being his native\r\nplace. There his father, Diego de Alvarado, comendador de Lobon in\r\nthe order of Santiago, and his mother, Sara de Contreras, struggled\r\nwith poverty to maintain the reputation of a good family name. At\r\nthe age of twenty-five Pedro came over to Santo Domingo, and prompted\r\nby vanity paraded himself in an old gown of his fathers, whereon was\r\nsewn the red cross of Santiago. At first he wore this garment inside\r\nout, giving as a reason his reduced circumstances which made him\r\nashamed to publicly own the rank of knight. On being reproved by the\r\nadmiral, he boldly affixed the insignia to his other dresses, and\r\nthenceforth called and signed himself the Comendador Alvarado.[104]\r\nThe title was never openly questioned in the Indies, where men had\r\nlittle time for inquiring into the affairs of others, and Alvarado\r\nfailed not with his plausible tongue and crafty nature to use it for\r\nobtaining certain privileges and advancement.\r\n\r\nWhen Grijalva prepared his expedition he was living as an encomendero,\r\nnear Trinidad, in Cuba, with five brothers.[105] As captain under\r\nthis chief he gave evidence of an enterprising nature, combined with\r\nan impatiency of restraint which ill fitted a subordinate. The want\r\nof principle already shown by his conduct at Santo Domingo was here\r\nmade apparent in the attempt to injure his commander with Velazquez,\r\nin order to further his own ends. His now prominent position as a\r\nwell-to-do gentleman, and the experience gathered under Grijalva,\r\nhad made him a welcome member of the present expedition. He had\r\nalso acquired the reputation of a good soldier and horseman, with\r\na bravery bordering on recklessness, and was a great favorite with\r\nhis men, among whom he also ranked as an able drill master. With an\r\nagile frame, he presented a most cheerful and pleasing countenance,\r\nfair, some called it, with a tendency to ruddiness. Its attraction\r\ncentred chiefly in the eyes, and afterward obtained for him among the\r\nIndians of Tlascala the appellation of _Tonatiuh_, the Sun.[106] His\r\nfirst glance thrown upon a combatant was the flash which was to be\r\nfollowed by the thunderbolt. Vanity prompted a careful attention to\r\ndress, but with a result approaching the showy rather than the elegant.\r\nHis manner, no less winning than the face, made him a most agreeable\r\ncompanion, the more so as he was a liberal fellow, particularly with\r\nrespect to women, and to pleasures generally. Beneath this smiling\r\nexterior, however, lay hidden an insatiable longing for power, and a\r\nblind worship of gold as the purchaser of pleasure, and under their\r\ninfluence he became at times so insensible to feelings of humanity\r\nas to place him outside the category of greatness.[107]\r\n\r\nAnother of Grijalva’s captains here present was Francisco de Montejo,\r\nwho came from Spain with Pedrarias Dávila in 1514. After enlisting men\r\nin Española, and aiding in the conquest of Cenú, he came to Cuba to\r\nwield the sword for Velazquez; but while ranking as a brave officer\r\nand a good horseman, he showed greater aptitude for business.\r\n\r\nAt the present time he was about thirty-five years of age, of medium\r\nstature, and with a bright face, which indicated love for pleasure\r\nand generous liberality.[108]\r\n\r\nAlonso de Ávila, the third of Grijalva’s brave lieutenants, had also\r\na pleasant face and liberal disposition, combined with good reasoning\r\npower, but was altogether too loud-spoken and argumentative, and\r\nhad an overbearing manner that created many enemies. He was about\r\nthirty-three years of age. Cristóbal de Olid, a year his junior, was a\r\nwell formed, strong-limbed man, with wide shoulders and a somewhat fair\r\ncomplexion. Despite the peculiarity of a groove in the lower lip, which\r\ngave it the appearance of being split, the face was most attractive,\r\nand the powerful voice helped to bear him out as a good talker. While\r\nlacking in sincerity and depth of thought, and being little fit for\r\nthe council, he possessed qualities which, in connection with great\r\nbravery and determination, made him an admirable executive officer;\r\nbut an ambition to command began to assert itself, and directed by\r\nevil influence it brought about his fall a few years later. Bernal\r\nDiaz calls him a very Hector in combat, and possessing, among other\r\ngood qualities, that of being liberal; on the whole an excellent\r\nman, though unfit to be a leader.[109] The youngest of the captains,\r\nthe most worshipful and the most lovable, was Gonzalo de Sandoval,\r\nan hidalgo of only twenty-two years, from Cortés’ own town, the son\r\nof a fortress commandant, but with merely a rudimentary education.\r\nBrave, intrepid, and with a good head, he was equally determined in\r\nspeech and in deportment, yet with a faultless obedience and loyalty\r\nthat won the confidence and esteem of his chief. With a strict eye to\r\ndiscipline, he possessed also a kind, humane disposition, which gained\r\nthe love and respect of his men, whose comfort he studied far more\r\nthan his own. Plain in dress, and modest in manner and aspiration, he\r\nwas free from the greed which tainted so many around him. A soldier\r\nin all qualities of the heart and mind, he was also physically fitted\r\nfor one. In battle he was as wrathful and as beautiful as Apollo\r\nwhen he slew the Python. The robust frame, with its high chest and\r\nbroad shoulders, supported a full face adorned with short, curly,\r\nnut-brown hair. The powerful voice, inclining at times to a lisp, was\r\nexhibited more in the issue of brief command than in conversation;\r\nfor Don Gonzalo was as energetic to act as he was chary of words.\r\nThe slightly bow-legged limbs indicated an early training for the\r\nsaddle. Indeed, equestrian exercises were his delight, and his horse\r\nMotilla, a chestnut with a white foot and a star on the forehead, is\r\ndescribed by Bernal Diaz as the finest he ever saw. Sandoval stands\r\nbefore us not only as an admirable man, but as an ideal officer,\r\nin his combined qualities of juvenile ardor and prudence, valor and\r\nhumanity, modesty of disposition and purity of heart. Cortés spoke of\r\nhim after his death with feelings of deepest regret, and represented\r\nhim to the emperor as one of the finest soldiers in the world, fit\r\nto command armies.[110]\r\n\r\nIn Velazquez de Leon we find another admirable officer, who possesses\r\nmany traits in common with Sandoval. He is described as about four\r\nyears older than that chivalrous youth, with a well formed, powerful\r\nframe, fine chest and shoulders, full face, set in a somewhat curled\r\nand carefully tended beard. He was open with the hand, ready with\r\nthe sword, and an expert horseman. He bore the reputation of having\r\nkilled a prominent and rich man in a duel in Española, a deed which\r\nhad obliged him to seek refuge in Cuba with his relation Velazquez.\r\n\r\nThe most devoted adherent of Velazquez, although not bound to him\r\nby ties of relationship, was his ancient mayordomo mayor, Diego de\r\nOrdaz,[111] a powerful man, of large stature, with full face, thin,\r\ndark beard, and stuttering speech. As a leader of foot-soldiers, for\r\nhe did not ride, he gained the reputation of possessing great daring,\r\nas well as a good head; and among comrades he ranked as a liberal man\r\nand a conversationalist. Of the other captains, Francisco de Salcedo,\r\nreputed chief butler to the admiral of Castile, bore the sobriquet\r\nof ‘Dandy’ from his spruce manner;[112] and Francisco de Morla is\r\nspoken of as a valiant soldier and good horseman.[113]\r\n\r\nOn the way over the vessels were dispersed by a squall, but were\r\ngathered by the flag-ship, some at Catoche, and some at Port San\r\nJuan, on the north end of Cozumel Island, where they all finally\r\ncongregated.[114] Quite early in the adventure Cortés was called on\r\nto spread before his unbridled associates the quality of discipline\r\nthey might expect. It seems that Alvarado arrived at Cozumel Island\r\ntwo days before the fleet, and had begun to carry matters with rather\r\na high hand for a subordinate. He had entered two towns, taken three\r\npersons captive, and seized some property of the natives. “Is this the\r\nway to win to our purpose barbarous peoples?” exclaimed the indignant\r\nCortés. For failing to bring the vessel to the rendezvous at Cape San\r\nAntonio, Alvarado’s pilot was placed in chains. A little later, seven\r\nsailors were flogged for theft and perjury. The captives were soothed\r\nwith presents and liberated, the stolen articles restored, and with\r\nthe aid of Melchor, the interpreter, the fears of the natives were\r\nassuaged.\r\n\r\nIn answer to his inquiries regarding the captive Christians, Cortés\r\nwas informed that two days’ journey in the interior of Yucatan bearded\r\nmen had been seen by Cozumel traders, not long since, whereupon two\r\nvessels were despatched to Catoche under Ordaz, who was there to\r\nawait, one week, the return of three Indian messengers, sent with\r\npresents to redeem the captives, and bearing a letter telling them\r\nwhere to find their countrymen.[115]\r\n\r\nWhile waiting events, Cortés landed the horses to explore and forage,\r\nand employed the otherwise unoccupied men in military exercise. The\r\nislanders were highly entertained, and thought the animals giant deer\r\nand the ships water-houses. In return they gave the strangers cause\r\nfor wonderment not unmixed with wrath; for this was a sacred island,\r\nin a heathen sense, and thither, from distant parts, resorted pilgrims\r\nwith offerings for sanguinary shrines. And when one feast-day the\r\npriests of Baal, within their temple, arose before the people and\r\ncalled upon the gods of their fathers, the excited Spaniards could\r\nnot contain themselves; Cortés stood forth and preached his religion\r\nto the indignant savages, but failing in the desired effect, the\r\nSpaniards rushed upon the idols, hurled them from their seats, and\r\nplanted in their place the emblem of their faith.[116]\r\n\r\nIn due time Ordaz returned without the lost Christians, greatly\r\nto the disappointment of Cortés, who desired them particularly for\r\ninterpreters. The fleet then set sail, but was obliged to return,\r\nowing to the leaky condition of Escalante’s vessel. While engaged\r\nupon repairs one day, the Spaniards being encamped upon the shore, a\r\ncanoe was seen approaching the harbor from the mainland. Andrés de\r\nTapia and others hastened to the landing, where presently the boat\r\narrived, and four tawny undressed figures stepped upon the shore. One\r\nwas bearded, and his form a little bent, and as he advanced before\r\nthe others there was eager questioning in the piercing glance he threw\r\nabout him. Presently he cried out in ill-articulated speech, “Señores,\r\nsois cristianos?” On being assured that they were, he dropped upon his\r\nknees, and with tears falling from uplifted eyes thanked God for his\r\ndeliverance. Tapia saw it at a glance; this was one of the captives.\r\nHastily stepping forward, he caught the uncouth object in his arms,\r\nraised him from the ground with a tender embrace, and conducted him\r\nto camp.[117] But for the beard it would have been difficult, from\r\nhis outward appearance, to believe him a European. Naturally of a\r\ndark complexion, he was now bronzed by exposure, and entirely naked\r\nexcept for a breech-cloth and sandals. His crown was shorn, and the\r\nremaining hair braided and coiled upon the head.[118] In his hand he\r\ncarried a net containing, among other things, a greasy prayer-book.\r\nOn being presented to Cortés he seemed dazed, scarcely knowing whether\r\nto call himself savage or civilized. At best he could not all at once\r\nthrow himself out of the former and into the latter category; for when\r\nhis Indian companions squatted themselves before the captain-general,\r\nand with the right hand, moistened by the lips, touched the ground\r\nand then the region of the heart in token of reverence, impelled by\r\nhabit he found himself doing the same. Cortés was touched. Lifting\r\nhim up, he threw over the naked Spaniard his own yellow mantle, lined\r\nwith crimson. He asked his name, and the man said he was Gerónimo de\r\nAguilar, ordained in minor orders, a native of Ecija, and relative\r\nof the Licenciado Marcos de Aguilar, known to Cortés in Española.\r\nHe and Gonzalo Guerrero, a sailor and a native of Palos, were the\r\nsole survivors of the expedition which, nearly eight years before,\r\nhad left Darien for Española, under Valdivia, whose shipwreck and\r\nhorrible fate I have elsewhere detailed.[119]\r\n\r\nIf backward at the beginning in the use of his tongue, Aguilar talked\r\nwell enough when started, giving his thrilling experiences in words\r\nwhich filled his listeners with amazement. On escaping from the lord\r\nof Maya, who had eaten Valdivia and the others with the same relish\r\nthat the Cyclops ate the companions of Ulysses, the survivors threw\r\nthemselves on the mercy of a neighboring cacique called Ahkin Xooc.\r\nHe with his successor, Taxmar, enslaved them, and treated them so\r\nseverely that all died but himself and the sailor, Guerrero. There is a\r\nlaw of relativity which applies to happiness and misery, no less than\r\nto mental and physical consciousness. By ways widely different these\r\ntwo men had saved themselves; the former by humility and chastity,\r\nthe latter by boldness and sensuality. Securing services under Nachan\r\nKan, cacique of Chetumal, the sailor adopted the dress and manners\r\nof the people, rapidly rose in favor, became the chief captain of\r\nhis master, married a woman of rank, and began to rear a dusky race;\r\nso that when the messengers of Cortés arrived he declined to be\r\nransomed.[120] Then blushing beneath his tawny skin the sanctified\r\nAguilar went on to tell of his own temptations and triumphs, in which\r\nhe had been as lonely as was Ethan Brand in hugging the unpardonable\r\nsin. So sublime had been his patience and his piety under the drudgery\r\nat first put upon him, that he too rose in the estimation of his\r\nmaster, who was led to entrust him with more important matters. For\r\nin all things pertaining to flesh and spirit he acted with so much\r\nconscientiousness that Taxmar, a stranger to those who loved virtue\r\nfor its own sake, suspected the motives that inspired his captives. To\r\ntest his wonderful integrity, for he had noticed that Aguilar never\r\nraised his eyes to look upon a woman, Taxmar once sent him for fish\r\nto a distant station, giving him as sole companion a beautiful girl,\r\nwho had been instructed to employ all her arts to cause the Christian\r\nto break his vow of continency. Care had been taken that there should\r\nbe but one hammock between them, and at night she bantered him to\r\noccupy it with her; but stopping his ears to the voice of the siren,\r\nhe threw himself upon the cold, chaste sands, and passed the night\r\nin peaceful dreams beneath the songs of heaven.[121]\r\n\r\nCortés smiled somewhat sceptically at this and like recitals, wherein\r\nthe sentiments expressed would have done honor to Scipio Africanus;\r\nnevertheless, he was exceedingly glad to secure this man, even\r\nthough he had been a little less chaste and brave and cunning than he\r\nrepresented himself to be. He found him not only useful but willing,\r\nfor this humble holy man was a great fighter, as he had said, and\r\nwas very ready to lead the Spaniards against his late master, though\r\npledged to peace and friendliness.\r\n\r\nEarly in March[122] the fleet again sailed, and after taking shelter\r\nfrom a gale behind Punta de las Mujeres for one or two days, passed\r\nround Catoche and along the Yucatan coast, hugging the shore to\r\nnote its features, and sending forth a growl of revenge on passing\r\nPotonchan. Boca de Términos was now reached, whither Escobar had\r\nbeen sent in advance to explore, and within the entrance of a little\r\nharbor, to which a boat’s crew was guided by blazings, a letter was\r\nfound, hidden in a tree, from which circumstance the harbor was named\r\nPuerto Escondido. The letter reported a good harbor, surrounded by rich\r\nlands abounding in game; and soon after the fleet met the exploring\r\nvessel, and learned of the important acquisition to the expedition\r\nin Grijalva’s lost dog.[123] Off Rio de Tabasco the fleet came to\r\nanchor, and the pilots knowing the bar to be low, only the smaller\r\nvessels entered the river. Remembering the friendly reception accorded\r\nGrijalva, the Spaniards were surprised to find the banks lined with\r\nhostile bands, forbidding them to land. Cortés therefore encamped at\r\nPunta de los Palmares, on an island about half a league up the river\r\nfrom the mouth, and not far from the capital of the Nonohualcas, a\r\nlarge town of adobe and stone buildings on the opposite mainland,\r\nprotected by a heavy stockade.[124]\r\n\r\nIn answer to a demand for water, the natives thereabout pointed to\r\nthe river; as for food, they would bring some on the morrow. Cortés\r\ndid not like the appearance of things; and when, during the night,\r\nthey began to remove their women and children from the town, he\r\nsaw that his work must begin here. More men and arms were landed on\r\nthe island, and Ávila was ordered to proceed to the mainland with\r\none hundred men, gain the rear of the town, and attack at a given\r\nsignal.[125] In the morning a few canoes arrived at the island with\r\nscanty provisions, all that could be obtained, the natives said;\r\nand further than this, the Spaniards must leave: if they attempted\r\nto penetrate the interior, they would be cut off to a man. Cortés\r\nanswered that his duty to the great king he served required him to\r\nexamine the country and barter for supplies. Entering the vessels,\r\nhe ordered them to advance toward the town; and in the presence of\r\nthe royal notary, Diego de Godoy, he made a final appeal for peace,\r\nas required by Spanish law, casting upon the natives the blame for\r\nthe consequences of their refusal. The reply came in the form of\r\nyells, mingled with the noise of conchs, trumpets, and drums, and a\r\nshower of arrows. The Spaniards drove their prows forward into the\r\nmud. The Indians crowded round in canoes to prevent their landing. A\r\nwell directed volley at once cleared the way, and notified Ávila to\r\nattack. Panic-stricken at the strangeness and suddenness of it all,\r\nthe natives fell back, but rallied at the call of their leaders, and\r\npoured a shower of arrows on the Spaniards as they threw themselves\r\ninto the water to wade ashore, receiving them at the point of their\r\nlances as they reached the bank. Tabasco’s men were powerful and brave.\r\nThe charge of cowardice had been flung at them by their neighbors for\r\nhaving been friendly with the Spaniards on former occasions, and they\r\nwere now determined to vindicate their character for courage. Once on\r\nsolid ground the Spaniards rang their battle-cry of “Sus, Santiago,\r\ná ellos!” Up, Santiago, and at them! and drove the enemy within the\r\nstockade. A breach was quickly made, and the defenders chased some\r\ndistance up the streets, where they made a stand, shouting “La, la,\r\ncalachoni!” Strike at the chief! At this juncture Ávila appeared.\r\nThe natives saw the day was lost to them, and they turned and fled.\r\nThe Spaniards did not pursue very far, but halted in an open space,\r\nwhere three stately temples invited to pillage, though little was\r\nfound worth taking, except some maize and fowl. During the action\r\neighteen Indians were killed and fourteen Spaniards wounded.[126]\r\nIn the formal taking of possession which followed, it was noticed by\r\nthose present that mention of the name of Velazquez was significantly\r\nomitted.[127]\r\n\r\nNext morning Alvarado and Francisco de Lugo, each with one hundred men,\r\nwere sent by different ways to reconnoitre and forage, with orders to\r\nreturn before dark.[128] Melchor, on being called to accompany one\r\nof them, was missing. Presently his clothes were discovered hanging\r\non a tree, indicating that he had gone over to the enemy. Lugo had\r\nadvanced not more than a league when, near a town called Centla, he\r\nencountered a large body of warriors, who attacked him fiercely and\r\ndrove him back toward the camp. Alvarado had meanwhile been turned\r\nby an estuary from his course and in the direction of Lugo. Hearing\r\nthe noise of battle he hastens to the assistance of Lugo, only to\r\nbe likewise driven back by the ever increasing hosts, and not until\r\nCortés came to the rescue with two guns did the enemy retire.[129]\r\nThe result, according to Bernal Diaz, was two of Lugo’s men killed\r\nand eleven wounded, while fifteen Indians fell and three were captured.\r\n\r\nNor did the matter rest here. The captives told Cortés that Tabasco,\r\nconcerned at the arrival of so large a fleet which augured hostile\r\noccupation, had aroused the province, the assembled chiefs being\r\nalso urged by Melchor to manfully expel the invaders, as the people\r\nof Potonchan had done. To depart now would leave a stain upon the\r\ngeneralship of Cortés in the eyes of both Spaniards and Indians such\r\nas was not to be thought of. There must be a battle fought and won.\r\nTo this end all the horses, cross-bows, firelocks, and guns were\r\nbrought on shore. Thirteen of the best horsemen[130] were selected\r\nto form a cavalry corps under the leadership of Cortés. The horses\r\nwere provided with poitrels having bells attached, and the riders\r\nwere to charge the thick of the enemy and strike at the face. Ordaz\r\nwas made chief of infantry and artillery, the latter being in special\r\ncharge of Mesa.[131] In order both to surprise the enemy and secure\r\ngood ground for the cavalry, Cortés resolved to advance at once on\r\nCentla. It was annunciation day, the 25th of March, when the army\r\nleft camp and stood before Centla, in the midst of broad maize and\r\ncocoa fields, intersected by irrigation ditches. The enemy were ready,\r\ntheir dark forms appearing in the distance under an agitated sea of\r\nglistening iztli. The cavalry now made a detour to gain their rear,\r\nwhile the infantry marched straight on.[132] Formidable as was in\r\ntruth the Spanish army, the unsophisticated natives made light of\r\nit, and came gayly forward to the combat in five squadrons, of eight\r\nthousand warriors each,[133] as Bernal Diaz says, “all in flowing\r\nplumes, with faces painted in red, white, and black, sounding drums\r\nand trumpets, and flourishing lances and shields, two-handed swords,\r\nfire-hardened darts, and slings, and every man protected by an armor\r\nof quilted cotton.” They would encircle these impudent interlopers,\r\nand did they not fall fainting beneath their brave yells and savage\r\nmusic, they would crush them like flies. And by way of beginning,\r\nthey sent forth a cloud of arrows, stones, and charred darts, wounding\r\nmany and killing one, a soldier named Saldaña. The Spaniards answered\r\nwith their cross-bows and firelocks, and mowed the packed masses with\r\ntheir cannon. The soft soil and ditches were less to the agile Indian\r\nthan to the heavily accoutred Spaniard.\r\n\r\nIt adds nothing to the honor of Spanish arms to throw in at this\r\njuncture a miracle to terrify the already half-paralyzed Indians, who\r\nmight otherwise prove too strong for their steel-clad assailants; but\r\nthe records compel me. While in the dire embrace of heathen hordes,\r\nmidst thrust and slash and crash of steel and stone, the enemy hewn\r\ndown and driven back only to give place to thrice the number, behold,\r\nupon a gray-spotted steed, a heavenly horseman appeared, and from a\r\nslight eminence overlooking the bloody field he frowned confusion on\r\nthe foe. The heathen warriors were stricken powerless, enabling the\r\nSpaniards to form anew; but when the horseman vanished, the Indians\r\nrallied. Thrice, with the same effect, the awful apparition came and\r\nwent.[134] Then there were horsemen indeed, more real to the Spaniards,\r\nbut none the less spectral to the Indians. They had been detained by\r\nthe marshes intervening; and now, with swords and helmets glittering,\r\nthey rose in the enemy’s rear, and midst clang of arms and shouts of\r\nSantiago y San Pedro, they threw themselves with terrible effect upon\r\nhim. What could the Indians do? Those that were not trampled or cut\r\nto death turned and fled, and the Spaniards possessed the field. “And\r\nthis was the first preaching of the gospel in New Spain, by Cortés,”\r\nremarks the caustic Las Casas.[135]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards drew up at a grove to return thanks for this great\r\nvictory. A large number of the enemy were slain. Sixty of their own\r\nnumber were wounded, and two lay dead; eight horses had been scratched,\r\nand their wounds were cauterized and anointed with the fat of dead\r\nIndians.[136] On returning to camp two of five captives, leading men,\r\nwere sent with presents to the cacique to represent the danger of\r\nfurther hostility, and to propose a council of peace. Tabasco was very\r\nready to lay down arms, and he sent a propitiatory offering of fowl,\r\nfried fish, and maize bread by messengers with blackened faces and\r\ndressed in rags. Cortés answered with a reprimand, “Tell your master,\r\nif he desires peace he must sue for it, and not send slaves.” Tabasco\r\nhastened to comply, and sent immediately to Cortés an embassy of\r\nforty chiefs, richly clad and walking in stately procession, followed\r\nby a file of slaves bearing presents. Low bowing before the bearded\r\nassembly, and swinging before them the censer in token of reverence,\r\nthe ambassador implored pardon, and proffered submission. “The blame\r\nis all your own,” said Cortés, with severity. The Indians acquiesced,\r\nthough it puzzled them to know for what they were to blame. Cortés\r\nfurther informed them that the great king, his master, had sent him\r\nto scatter blessings, if they were found deserving; if not, to let\r\nloose upon them the caged lightning and the thunder which he carried.\r\nWhereat the gun charged for the occasion was fired, and as the noise\r\nreverberated over the hills and the ball went crashing through the\r\ntrees, the Indians fell prostrate with fear, and the noble Europeans\r\nwere proud of their superiority.\r\n\r\nReassured against further punishment, the next trick played upon\r\nthem was to tie a mare in the bushes in sight of a stallion which\r\nthey paraded before their visitors; and when he neighed and reared\r\nand plunged to get to his mate, the natives were told that the great\r\nbeast was angry because of the peace that was being made, and only\r\nfurther gifts would pacify him.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Tabasco presented himself in person, attended\r\nby a large retinue, and bringing presents, among which were some gold\r\nornaments of little value and twenty female slaves. The terms dictated\r\nby Cortés were that they should return their women and children to\r\nthe village within two days, in token of their good faith, and that\r\nthe treacherous Melchor should be delivered up. But the unfortunate\r\ninterpreter had already suffered death in return for his bad advice.\r\nIt was useless to demand gold, for there was little or none here.\r\nSo they proceeded at once to expound the doctrines of their faith;\r\nto lay before them the truths of the gospel which they had come so\r\nfar to bring. An altar was erected in the chief temple on which was\r\nplaced a large cross. From this altar Father Olmedo preached to the\r\nnatives, and here were baptized the first converts to the church in\r\nNew Spain, consisting of the twenty female slaves, who were afterward\r\ndistributed among the leaders. Then followed the ceremonial tender of\r\nallegiance by the chiefs of Tabasco’s province to the Spanish king,\r\nand the formal naming of the large town, which was called Santa María\r\nde la Victoria, in commemoration of the victory.[137]\r\n\r\nPalm Sunday being at hand, it was resolved to celebrate it in such\r\na manner as to further impress the natives. Attired in their most\r\nbrightly colored garments, with palms in their hands and banners aloft,\r\nthe Spaniards marched in solemn procession, to harmonious chants, about\r\nthe temple; and when these doughty men of war humbled themselves before\r\nthe symbols of their faith, the wondering heathen thought that great\r\nindeed must be the god worshipped by such beings. After commending\r\nthe sacred emblems to the care of the chiefs, with a promise to send\r\nholy men to teach them the true faith, and with assurances of royal\r\nprotection, the Spaniards bade the Nonohualcas farewell, and were\r\nshortly on their way again.\r\n\r\nKeeping close to the shore for purposes of observation, the several\r\nplaces observed and named by Grijalva were pointed out to Cortés and\r\ncommented upon by those who had accompanied the former expedition.\r\nCertain of the new captains took umbrage at this assumption of superior\r\nknowledge, accompanied by liberal proffers of advice; and one of\r\nthem, the polished Puertocarrero, broke out in a strain of pleasant\r\nsarcasm. “It seems to me, señor,” he said, taking the incidents\r\nof a well-known romance for his text, “as if these gentlemen would\r\nenlighten you, in the words of the father of Montesinos:\r\n\r\n     Behold France, Montesinos;\r\n     Behold Paris, the city;\r\n     Behold the waters of Douro,\r\n     Where they fall into the sea!\r\n\r\nNow I would humbly suggest that your worship yourself should seek out\r\nrich lands and learn to govern them wisely.” Catching the significance\r\nof the words, Cortés replied: “Let God only grant success to our arms,\r\nas he did to Paladin Roldan, and with such gentlemen as yourself to\r\naid me I shall well know what to do.”\r\n\r\nGliding past islas Blanca and Verde, the fleet anchored behind San\r\nJuan de Ulua late on Thursday in passion week.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [104] ‘Qustando ... en la cibdad de Sto Domingo vibiendo\r\n     con el Almirante.’ _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_,\r\n     pp. xi. 61; _Juarros_, _Guat._, i. 252.\r\n\r\n     [105] ‘Todos hermanos, que fue el Capitan Pedro de Aluarado,\r\n     y Gonçalo de Aluarado, y Jorge de Aluarado, y Gonçalo\r\n     [Alonzo] y Gomez, è Juan de Alvarado el viejo, que era\r\n     bastardo.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.

A Mexican picture gives him\r\n     dark beard and a yellow helmet or head-dress, the same\r\n     colors being given to the beard and head-dress of figures\r\n     representing the Spanish troops. Ramirez is rather inclined\r\n     to doubt the authenticity of the portrait so frequently\r\n     copied from Cortina’s copper-plates, representing him as of\r\n     dark complexion, with long, meagre, pointed face, very high\r\n     forehead, stubbed hair, mustache, and imperial. _Ramirez_,\r\n     _Proceso contra Alvarado_, pp. xi. xxii. 277-82, with plates.\r\n     _Prescott’s Mex._ (Mex. 1844), i. 458; _Id._ (_Gondra ed._),\r\n     iii. 220; _Carbajal Espinosa_, _Hist.

Several\r\n     authors, following Gomara, it seems, refer to one vessel\r\n     as missing, but as this is identified with Escobar’s,\r\n     sent, according to Bernal Diaz, on a special exploring\r\n     expedition to Laguna de Términos, the view of the latter\r\n     author is probably more correct. It is not likely that a\r\n     captain would have sailed so far beyond the rendezvous, and\r\n     there waited for weeks the chance arrival of the fleet. In\r\n     _Tapia_, _Relacion_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii.\r\n     557, are references yet more vague to a missing vessel.\r\n     During the gale Morla’s vessel was struck by a wave, which\r\n     unshipped her rudder. His signal of distress caused the\r\n     flag-ship to heave to till daybreak. The rudder was then\r\n     discovered floating close by, and tying a rope to his body,\r\n     Morla leaped into the sea to aid in replacing it. _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 16; _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 458.\r\n\r\n     [115] The letter, as given in _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     17, and _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 19, differs somewhat in\r\n     tenor, and the former assigns eight days, the latter six, as\r\n     the time Ordaz was to wait. Gomara writes further that the\r\n     Indians were at first afraid to venture on such an errand\r\n     into the interior, but the large reward overcame their\r\n     fears, and they were carried to the cape in Escalante’s\r\n     vessel, escorted by Ordaz in two other craft manned by fifty\r\n     men. Cogolludo, _Hist. Yucathan_, 20, thinks there could\r\n     be no danger for messengers. ‘Escondieron [the letter] a\r\n     vno entre los cabellos, que trahian largos y trenzados,\r\n     rebueltos, a la cabeça: y embiò los dos nauios de menos\r\n     porte ... con veynte ballesteros, y escopeteros ... y que\r\n     el menor boluiesse a dar cuenta de lo que auian hecho.’\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. iv. cap. vi.; _Peter Martyr_,\r\n     dec. iv. cap. vi. ‘Envió un bergantin é cuatro bateles ...\r\n     que esperarian cinco dias, é no mas.’ _Tapia_, _Relacion_,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 556. Las Casas, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, iv. 459, states that the cacique of Cozumel, eager\r\n     to communicate freely with Cortés, sent messengers to the\r\n     lord owning one of the captives, and asked him to sell or\r\n     lend the man. Cortés at first proposed to rescue the captive\r\n     with an armed force, but the cacique suggested a ransom\r\n     as more effective. _Solis_, _Hist. Mex._, i. 76; _Landa_,\r\n     _Rel. de Yuc._, 24-6.\r\n\r\n     [116] Two carpenters, Alonso Yañez and Álvaro Lopez, claim\r\n     the honor of having raised the first cross for the church in\r\n     New Spain. To this the natives made no great objection, the\r\n     cross having already with them a religious significance; and\r\n     surely the sanctified effigy of the benign Mary was a more\r\n     beautiful object to look upon than their idols. See _Native\r\n     Races_, iii. 468-70. In one of the temples ‘auia vna cruz\r\n     de cal tan alta como diez palmos.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     24. Las Casas objects to the compulsory mode of conversion\r\n     used by Cortés and his holy company, and devotes a long\r\n     paragraph to depicting the folly and evil thereof. _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, iv. 460-2, 470. Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 18,\r\n     describes the idolatrous rite, and Prescott, _Mex._, i.\r\n     269-71, speaks of Cortés as a reformer.\r\n\r\n     [117] This is the substance of Tapia’s own account.\r\n     _Relacion_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 556-7. Others\r\n     differ somewhat in the number of Indians who arrive in the\r\n     canoe, in the mode of addressing Tapia, and other points.\r\n     According to Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 19, some soldiers\r\n     out hunting report the approach of the canoe, whereupon\r\n     Cortés sends Tapia to ascertain its object. Seven Indians\r\n     of Cozumel land, and, on seeing the Spaniards advance, are\r\n     about to flee in alarm, but one of them reassures the rest,\r\n     and calls out, ‘Dios, y Santa María, y Sevilla.’ While he\r\n     is embraced by Tapia, a soldier rushes to announce the news\r\n     to Cortés. According to Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 20, it is\r\n     meal-time and first Sunday in Lent when the news of a canoe\r\n     with four Indians is brought. The fleet had been prevented\r\n     by a storm from sailing on the previous day.\r\n\r\n     [118] This was a common form of Maya hair-dress. Bernal\r\n     Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 19, and some others describe him\r\n     as shorn like a slave; but this man appears to have risen\r\n     from that condition. He gives him an extra pair of sandals,\r\n     hanging at the waist, a dilapidated mantle or cloth—called\r\n     a net by Herrera—wherein is tied a thumbed prayer-book, and\r\n     upon the shoulder he places an oar. This oar is brought\r\n     into camp by almost every writer, regardless of the fact\r\n     that it did not belong to him and could no longer be of\r\n     use. Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 20, gives him bow and arrows.\r\n     Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 461, remarks that in the\r\n     prayer-book was kept an account of time, which marked this\r\n     day as a Wednesday, while it really was Sunday.\r\n\r\n     [119] See _Hist. Cent. Am._, i. 350, this series.\r\n\r\n     [120] Aguilar intimated another reason why Guerrero remained,\r\n     that he had taken part in the fights against Córdoba and\r\n     Grijalva at Potonchan, which is very doubtful. Then it is\r\n     said that his face was tattooed and his lips turned down,\r\n     and when Aguilar besought him to go the children clung to\r\n     him, and the wife first begged, and then threatened, to\r\n     make Aguilar desist. _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_, 23;\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 18-19; _Torquemada_, i. 370.\r\n\r\n     [121] This is in substance the adventures of Aguilar, as\r\n     related at length in _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. iv. cap.\r\n     vii.-viii., followed by _Torquemada_, i. 370-72, and\r\n     _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_, 24-9, and prettily, though\r\n     hastily, elaborated in _Irving’s Columbus_, iii. 290-301,\r\n     and other modern writers. On reaching Catoche and finding\r\n     Ordaz gone, he proceeded to Cozumel, in the hope of finding\r\n     some of the Spaniards. ‘Era Aguilar estudiante quando passò\r\n     a las Indias, y hombre discreto, y por esto se puede creer\r\n     qualquiera cosa del,’ concludes Herrera, as if suspecting\r\n     that the version may be questioned. Prudence is shown in\r\n     the care with which he gradually accustomed himself to the\r\n     change of food and habits on again joining the Spaniards.\r\n     Peter Martyr, dec. iv. cap. vi., relates that Aguilar’s\r\n     mother became insane on hearing that her son had fallen\r\n     among cannibals—who brought her the news it is hard to\r\n     guess—and whenever she beheld flesh roasting, loud became\r\n     the laments for his sad fate. This is repeated in _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 22; _Martinez_, _Hist. Nat. Nueva Esp._,\r\n     ii. xxiv. Herrera, who cannot avoid mixing in all the\r\n     romance possible, makes him search for means to cross the\r\n     strait. He finds at last a leaky canoe half buried in the\r\n     sand, and in this frail skiff he and the Indian companion\r\n     presented by his late master managed to gain the island.\r\n     Others give him Cortés’ messengers for companions. Bernal\r\n     Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 18, very reasonably permits him to\r\n     hire a canoe with six rowers, for he has beads to pay for\r\n     it, and canoes would not be wanting, since the island was\r\n     a resort for pilgrims, particularly at this very time.\r\n     Mendieta, _Hist. Ecles._, 175-76, fails not to recognize,\r\n     in the compulsory return of the fleet to Cozumel, and in\r\n     the finding of Aguilar, the hand of God; and Torquemada,\r\n     i. 370, eagerly elaborates the miraculous features in the\r\n     appearance of this Aaron, who is to be the mouth-piece of\r\n     his Moses.\r\n\r\n     [122] Bernal Diaz says the 4th, which is rather close\r\n     reckoning, according to his own account, for two days are\r\n     required to reach Cozumel from Cape San Antonio, nine days\r\n     are consumed by Ordaz in waiting for the captives, and four\r\n     days for repairing Escalante’s leaky vessel. This alone\r\n     brings us from February 18th, the date of leaving Cape San\r\n     Antonio, to March 5th, without counting a probable day or\r\n     two for preparing, starting, and returning.\r\n\r\n     [123] A greyhound bitch, really of great service to the\r\n     hunters. Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 20, starts Escobar\r\n     from Punta de las Mujeres. _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, Pt.\r\n     iii. 112. Cogolludo, _Hist. Yucathan_, 29, while adopting\r\n     on hearsay the more general supposition that a missing\r\n     vessel is found here, follows Diaz in the account of the\r\n     exploring vessel. Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 25-6, and Herrera,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. iv. cap. xi., evidently attributes the name\r\n     Escondido to the finding of the missing vessel.\r\n\r\n     [124] ‘Mille quingentorum passuum, ait Alaminus nauclerus,\r\n     et domorum quinque ac viginti millium ... egregie lapidibus\r\n     et calce fabrefectæ.’ _Peter Martyr_, _De Insvlis_, 14. ‘A\r\n     poco mas de media legua que subian por el, (river) vieron vn\r\n     gran pueblo con las casas de adoues y los tejados de paja,\r\n     el qual estaua cercado de madera, con bien gruessa pared\r\n     y almenas, y troneras para flechar.’ Halls and temples are\r\n     also referred to: ‘Mas no tiene veinte y cinco mil casas.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 26-37. ‘Punta de los Palmares [where\r\n     Grijalva also camped], que estava del pueblo de Tabasco otro\r\n     media legua.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 20. Montanus,\r\n     _Nieuwe Weereld_, 77, follows Gomara and Martyr, in calling\r\n     the pueblo Potonchan; so does Helps, _Span. Conq._, ii.\r\n     260-4, who frequently reveals the superficiality of his\r\n     researches. Brasseur de Bourbourg calls it Centla. _Hist.\r\n     Nat. Civ._, iv. 58. The stockade defences are described in\r\n     detail in _Solis_, _Hist. Mex._, i. 93-4.\r\n\r\n     [125] ‘Mandò poner en cada vn batel tres tiros.’ Ávila\r\n     received one hundred soldiers, including ten cross-bowmen,\r\n     and took a route leading across creeks and marshes to\r\n     the rear of the pueblo. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     20. ‘Señalo Cortés dos capitanes con cada cienticinquenta\r\n     Españoles. Que fueron Alonso di Auila, y Pedro de Aluarado.’\r\n     A ford was found half a league above the camp. _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 27; Peter Martyr, dec. iv. cap. vii., sends\r\n     one hundred and fifty men by different routes. The testimony\r\n     favors the supposition that Ávila forded the river.\r\n\r\n     [126] Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 20, estimates that\r\n     twelve thousand warriors defended the town. He himself\r\n     received a wound in the thigh. Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 29,\r\n     leaves only four hundred in charge of the place. Peter\r\n     Martyr, dec. iv. cap. vii., allows the horses to share in\r\n     the battle, and places the warriors at four thousand. Las\r\n     Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 474, exaggerates, of course, the\r\n     Spanish excesses, but without giving definite statements.\r\n\r\n     [127] ‘Intẽtaba hacer lo que despues hizo,’ says Vetancvrt,\r\n     _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 112, in reference to the later\r\n     effected independence of Velazquez. The mode of taking\r\n     possession is thus described: Advancing with drawn sword\r\n     and shield to a large ceiba-tree in the court-yard, Cortés\r\n     struck it three times, and announced that he took possession\r\n     for the king, and would defend his right against all comers.\r\n     The soldiers thereupon shouted their approval, declaring\r\n     that they would sustain their captain in his challenge.\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 21. Zamacois compares this\r\n     form with others used elsewhere. _Hist. Méj._, x. 988.\r\n\r\n     [128] The _Carta del Ayunt. de Vera Cruz_, in _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 15, refers to a certain intercourse held with\r\n     natives; on the third day the exploring parties start. This\r\n     intercourse is spoken of by Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 30, as the\r\n     visit of twenty leading men to promise food and presents,\r\n     but really to spy. The Spaniards were encouraged to enter\r\n     the interior to barter food. _Torquemada_, i. 374; _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 21. Alvarado, Ávila, and Sandoval\r\n     are sent, each with eighty Spaniards and some Cuban carriers,\r\n     to explore by three routes, and to get supplies for payment\r\n     only. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 31; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     iv. cap. xi. Three parties sent out. _Tapia_, _Relacion_,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 559. Four captains sent,\r\n     with over two hundred men. _Carta del Ayunt._, loc. cit.\r\n\r\n     [129] Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 31, states that one of the\r\n     captains took refuge in a building in Centla town, and\r\n     was there joined by the other two. All three now retreat\r\n     to camp, whither two fleet Cubans run for aid. Herrera,\r\n     Torquemada, and Brasseur de Bourbourg follow him. Before\r\n     Cortés set out, says Cogolludo, _Hist. Yucathan_, 32, he\r\n     had repelled an attack on his own camp.\r\n\r\n     [130] ‘Señalo treze de a cauallo,’ who are named as Olid,\r\n     Alvarado, Puertocarrero, Escalante, Montejo, Ávila, Velazquez\r\n     de Leon, Morla, Láres the good horseman to distinguish him\r\n     from another Láres, Gonzalo Dominguez, Moron of Bazamo, and\r\n     Pedro Gonzalez of Trujillo, Cortés being the thirteenth.\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 22; Solis, _Hist. Mex._, i.\r\n     106, says fifteen horses, but in the _Carta del Ayunt. de\r\n     V. Cruz_, in _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 16, the number decreases\r\n     to ten.\r\n\r\n     [131] Gomara says the force mustered 500 men, 13 horses\r\n     and 6 guns; Herrera, 400 men and 12 horses. The alférez\r\n     was Antonio de Villaroel.\r\n\r\n     [132] This was a favorite movement of Cortés, and as such\r\n     Tapia and the _Carta del Ayunt. de V. Cruz_ accept it, while\r\n     Bernal Diaz and most writers state that the swampy ground\r\n     required a circuit.\r\n\r\n     [133] An estimate based probably upon the strength of the\r\n     regular Aztec _Xiquipilli_, with which the conquerors were\r\n     soon to become acquainted. See _Native Races_, ii. 425.\r\n     Tapia even raises the number to six squadrons. _Relacion_,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 560.\r\n\r\n     [134] Cortés, on coming up and being told of this,\r\n     shouted, ‘Onward, companions! God is with us!’ _Relacion_,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 559-60. Gomara, who\r\n     fervently adopts the story, states that the rider was one\r\n     of the apostles, in the person of Morla. ‘Todos dixeron,\r\n     que vieron por tres vezes al del cauallo rucio picado\r\n     ... y que era Santiago nuestro patron. Fernando Cortés\r\n     mas queria que fuesse san Pedro, su especial auogado ...\r\n     aun tambien los Indios lo notaron.... De los prisioneros\r\n     que se tomarõ se supo esto.’ _Hist. Mex._, 32-3. Pizarro\r\n     y Orellana, _Varones Ilvstres_, 72-3, gives arguments to\r\n     show that it could have been none other than Santiago, as\r\n     the patron of Spaniards. After a struggle with his pious\r\n     fears, Bernal Diaz ventures to observe that Gomara may\r\n     be right, but ‘I, unworthy sinner, was not graced to see\r\n     either of those glorious apostles.’ Testimony was taken\r\n     about the battle, and had this occurred it would have been\r\n     spoken of. ‘I say that our victory was by the hand of our\r\n     Lord Jesus Christ, for in that battle the Indians were so\r\n     numerous that they could have buried us with handfuls of\r\n     earth.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 22-3. Las Casas scouts the story\r\n     as a fabrication of Cortés, written down by ‘his servant\r\n     Gomara,’ in ‘his false history.’ _Hist. Ind._, iv. 477.\r\n\r\n     [135] The bishop forgets the sermon before the idols cast\r\n     down at Cozumel.\r\n\r\n     [136] Two Spaniards fell, and over 800 Indians lay dead,\r\n     so said their countrymen. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     22-3. Over 70 Spaniards were wounded, and more than 300\r\n     Indians were slain in the pursuit alone. Over 100 men fell\r\n     sick from heat and bad water, but all recovered. _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 33. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. iv. cap. xi., allows\r\n     no killed among the Spaniards, while over 1000 Indians are\r\n     laid low. _Torquemada_, i, 375. Three Spaniards are killed\r\n     and 60 wounded. _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 113.\r\n     The Ayuntamiento of Vera Cruz, in its letter to the Emperor,\r\n     10 July, 1519, for obvious reasons lowers the figures to\r\n     twenty wounded Spaniards, of whom none died, and to 220\r\n     dead Indians, out of 40,000 engaged. _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     17. Finally comes Las Casas with the other extreme of 30,000\r\n     souls, said to have been cruelly slaughtered in this first\r\n     great battle of Cortés. _Hist. Ind._, iv. 477. Quite a list\r\n     of misdeeds are here raked up, or invented rather, against\r\n     the Spaniards in the _West-Indische Spieghel_, Amsterdam,\r\n     1624, a curious little quarto, designed for Dutch traders\r\n     in America, and dedicated to their West India Company. The\r\n     author is called Athanasium Inga. ‘_Peruaen_, uyt Cusco\r\n     gheboren, die dit alles, soo door onder vindinghe als door\r\n     transpositie en overset tinghe sijnder Voor-Ouderen, hier\r\n     te Lande ons overghedraghen heeft,’ says Wachter, in the\r\n     preface. The volume opens with a lengthy description of\r\n     the Antilles, but the remaining text is wholly devoted to\r\n     the Spanish colonies on the main, mingled without order,\r\n     and interspersed with special chapters on navigation and\r\n     coast routes for the benefit of traders. Beside the usual\r\n     description of physical and political geography, with\r\n     particular reference to natural resources and aboriginal\r\n     customs, several voyages are described, mainly to point out\r\n     sailing directions and the progress of discovery, while the\r\n     conquest period is told with some minuteness, but garbled\r\n     with the idea of exposing the avarice and cruelty of the\r\n     hated Spaniards. This is also the object of nearly all the\r\n     neatly engraved copper-plates. The map extends Hudson Bay\r\n     very close to the Pacific coast, where a faintly outlined\r\n     strait is visible some distance above California Island.\r\n     The part relating to Mexico, including some brief references\r\n     to Central America, occupies about one third of the volume,\r\n     and treats chiefly of the Conquest. The book is remarkable\r\n     for its black-letter text, with marginals in the same type,\r\n     and for its title-page, with the figures of ‘Montenchuma’\r\n     and ‘Atabaliba’ surrounded by battle-scenes and Indian\r\n     industrial operations.\r\n\r\n     [137] ‘Y pusose nombre a aquel pueblo, Santa Maria de la\r\n     Vitoria, è assi se llama agora la villa de Tabasco.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 24. ‘Potanchanum dicitur ab accolis\r\n     oppidum.... Victoriam nostri appellarunt.’ _Peter Martyr_,\r\n     _De Insvlis_, 14; copied in _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 36.\r\n     Referring to the battle of Centla, Clavigero writes: ‘e per\r\n     memoria vi fondarono poi una piccola città, col nome della\r\n     _Madonna della Vittoria_, la quale fu per lungo tempo la\r\n     capitale di quella Provincia.... Si spopolò del tutto verso\r\n     la metà del secolo passato.’ A later foundation received\r\n     the name of Villahermosa. _Storia Mess._, iii. 11. This\r\n     is based on a statement by Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     22, and to reconcile this with the note above, it must\r\n     be supposed that the Nonohualca capital was removed to\r\n     the site of the battle-field when the Spaniards settled.\r\n     Other authors either confound the points or avoid them by\r\n     a vague reference. Victoria was founded by Cortés in 1519.\r\n     _Alcedo_, _Dic._, v. 305. It is strange that the chief town\r\n     is not referred to under its native name, for Potonchan is\r\n     evidently a mistake by Peter Martyr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nWHAT MONTEZUMA THOUGHT OF IT.\r\n\r\n     HOME OF MEXICAN CIVILIZATION—THE BORDER LAND OF\r\n     SAVAGISM—CONFIGURATION OF THE COUNTRY—THE NAHUAS AND\r\n     THE MAYAS—TOLTECS, CHICHIMECS, AND AZTECS—THE VALLEY OF\r\n     MEXICO—CIVIL POLITY OF THE AZTECS—KING AHUITZOTL—MONTEZUMA\r\n     MADE EMPEROR—CHARACTER OF THE MAN—HIS CAREER—THE FIRST\r\n     APPEARING OF THE SPANIARDS NOT UNKNOWN TO MONTEZUMA—THE\r\n     QUETZALCOATL MYTH—DEPARTURE OF THE FAIR GOD—SIGNS AND OMENS\r\n     CONCERNING HIS RETURN—THE COMING OF THE SPANIARDS MISTAKEN\r\n     FOR THE FULFILMENT OF THE PROPHECY—THE DOOR OPENED TO THE\r\n     INVADER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the crusade which was so painfully to affect the\r\ndestinies of this vast interior, let us cast a brief glance upon the\r\ncountry and its inhabitants, and particularly on that idiosyncrasy\r\nof the aboriginal mind which opened the door to the invaders. The\r\nfirst two subjects are fully treated in the first, second, and fifth\r\nvolumes of my _Native Races of the Pacific States_ to which I would\r\nrefer the reader, being able here to give only an outline of what in\r\ndetail is an exceedingly interesting phase of indigenous development.\r\n\r\nThis development awoke to consciousness in the forms of the Nahua and\r\nMaya civilizations, the former occupying the northern portion of that\r\ntropical table-land which rises to salubrious heights between latitudes\r\n22° and 11°, and the latter the southern portions. Round the opaque\r\nlowland edges of this heaven-enlightened interior the mind of man\r\nseemed also dark and low, dwarfed by sandy sweeps, or overshadowed by\r\nredundant foliage; yet it was not altogether free from the influence\r\nof its neighbors, for the people of the tierras calientes bordering\r\nthis elevation were further removed from savagism than their more\r\nnorthern and southern brethren. The valley of Mexico, the Anáhuac\r\nof the Aztecs, was situated between the two principal ranges, the\r\nPacific branch and the Atlantic branch of the Sierra Madre, under\r\nwhich name the great cordillera here presents itself, coming in from\r\nthe north-west, flattening near the centre, and reuniting before\r\nreaching Tehuantepec. Eventually Anáhuac overspreads the whole plateau.\r\nCross the continent on the nineteenth parallel and you will reach the\r\ngreatest elevation and see the highest mountains in this vicinity.\r\nIndeed, from the plain of Puebla, whereabout lay the walled town of\r\nTlascala, you may take in Popocatepetl, Iztaccihuatl, and Orizaba at\r\none view. Within seventy leagues from Vera Cruz inland, through the\r\ntemperate valley of Orizaba, you may pass from a region of palms to\r\na region of pines. The plains of Tabasco, upon whose border we have\r\nalready landed and fought our battle, form the north-eastern part of\r\nthe broad isthmus valley of Tehuantepec. This is bordered on the south\r\nby the sierra connecting the elevation of Anáhuac with the table-land\r\nof Guatemala, whose western declivity breaks into parallel wooded\r\nridges running due south-west. North of Anáhuac the surface settles\r\ninto wide plains between short sierras, until monotonous quietude\r\nis attained in the prairies of Texas and New Mexico. Crossing the\r\nisthmus of Tehuantepec at a diminished altitude the cordillera rises\r\nagain and stretches out into the broad and lofty ranges of Central\r\nAmerica, where the Maya nations made their home.\r\n\r\nEarliest among the Nahua nations to stand forth upon the mythic record\r\nare the Toltecs, whose first supremacy in Anáhuac is placed in the\r\nsixth century. Endowed by tradition with a culture surpassing that\r\nof their successors, the halo surrounding their name has been kept\r\nbright by monuments, such as the pyramids of Teotihuacan and Cholula.\r\nFor five centuries this people flourish, sustained by a confederation\r\nof kings whose capitals become in turn famous as seats of learning\r\nand of imperial splendor. Religious strife, developing gradually\r\ninto civil war, with attendant famine and pestilence, opens the door\r\nto ruder tribes, and the Toltecs pass off the stage. Throwing off\r\nthe Toltec veil so long shielding them, a number of tribes now rise\r\ninto distinct political existence, and the stronger, in connection\r\nwith somewhat ruder yet more energetic incomers, form the new ruling\r\ncombination, the Chichimec empire. Of the leading power, denominated\r\nthe Chichimec, nothing is known; but the permanency of Nahua language\r\nand civilization leads to the supposition that it is of the same race\r\nas its predecessors. In later times the name is also applied to the\r\nwild border tribes of the north. For several centuries Anáhuac becomes\r\nthe scene of intrigues and struggles between the different branches\r\nof the combination for the balance of power, during which a number of\r\ntowns figure as dominating centres, and a number of tribes rise to\r\nprominence under the traditional term of conquerors and immigrants.\r\nAmong these are the Aztecs, the representative nation of the Nahua\r\ncivilization at the coming of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nUpon opposite sides of the largest of a cluster of lakes which\r\nilluminate the oval valley of Mexico have stood, since the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century, three cities, Tezcuco, Mexico, and Tlacopan,\r\ncapitals of three confederate nations, the Acolhuas, the Aztecs, and\r\nthe Tepanecs. To the first belonged the eastern portion of the valley,\r\nto the second the southern and western, and to the third a small\r\nportion of the north-west. Of this confederation, Tezcuco was for a\r\ntime the most powerful; Tlacopan was least. While keeping to their\r\nrespective limits within the valley, beyond its classic precincts\r\nthe three powers made common cause against the barbarians. About\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century, under the warlike Montezuma\r\nI., Mexico attained the supremacy, and during the next sixty years\r\nextended her empire to the shores of either ocean. Within this\r\ncircuit, however, were several nations which she never conquered;\r\ninstance the Tlascaltecs, the Tarascos, and the Chiapanecs. Many there\r\nwere—for example, the people of Tehuantepec, of northern Guatemala,\r\nand Soconusco, and the Miztecs and Zapotecs of Oajaca, whose conquest\r\nby the Aztecs was temporary—who either paid tribute for a time only,\r\nor who threw off the yoke the moment the invader’s back was turned.\r\nThe Matlaltzincas, west of the lakes, and the Huastecs and Totonacs\r\nof Vera Cruz, were subjugated but a few years prior to the appearing\r\nof the Spaniards. These coast-dwellers had not yet become reconciled\r\nto the rule of the interior lords, but hated them as inveterate\r\nfoes; and herein lay one of the chief causes of success accompanying\r\nthe Castilian arms. Indeed, Aztec supremacy was maintained in every\r\nquarter only by constant war; rebellion, as soon as checked in one\r\nquarter, breaking out in another. Further than this, the Aztecs, by\r\ntheir overbearing spirit, had become obnoxious to their allies; yet\r\ntheir aggressive policy was continued in full force by the predecessor\r\nof Montezuma II., Ahuitzotl, with whom war was an absorbing passion.\r\n\r\nIn the civil polity of the Aztecs were elements which, if given free\r\nplay, would by elevating the people raise the nation yet higher in\r\nthe scale of domination. This did not escape the observant neighbors,\r\nupon whom the prospect fell with chilling fear, a fear by no means\r\nmitigated by the ever increasing tendency of the Mexicans for the\r\nimmolation of human beings. Nor were the Aztec nobles pleased to see\r\npolitical power slipping from their grasp and falling into the hands\r\nof the people, among whom the spirit of republicanism and equality\r\nwas regarded as having already gained too great ascendancy. The\r\nresult was a struggle, not unlike that at the same time going on in\r\nEurope, between the nobility and the commonalty, the clergy taking\r\nsides with the former. And at the death of Ahuitzotl the higher class\r\nsucceeded in raising to the throne a person of extreme aristocratic\r\nand religious tastes, though humble withal, as Coriolanus could not\r\nbe, to catch the common herd; for when tidings of his election were\r\nbrought him he was found sweeping the temple.\r\n\r\nMontezuma, he was called, and surnamed Xocoyotzin, the younger, to\r\ndistinguish him from the first Montezuma, known as Huehue, the elder.\r\nHe was the son of Axayacatl and Xochicueitl, and nephew of the late\r\nking; and had reached only his thirty-fourth year when selected for\r\nthe throne, in preference to an elder brother. The reasons alleged for\r\nthis distinction were the possession of high qualities as a warrior,\r\nwhose bravery had been tested on more than one field of battle; as\r\nan adviser, whose words, uttered in clear, dignified tones, had been\r\nheard in the council with respect; and as high priest, whose gravity\r\nand circumspection had won him favor among all classes. Upon occasions\r\nhe could observe the taciturnity which so often attracts a reputation\r\nfor wisdom; and, moreover, he possessed a fine figure and a majestic\r\npresence, such as admirably suited the monarch. He was proficient in\r\nastronomy, picture-writing, and in certain esoteric branches, for\r\nwhich he showed a natural bent; likewise he was well read in the\r\nhistory of his people, and familiar with all their traditions.\r\n\r\nThis second Montezuma was a born prince, and might have been a\r\npattern for Niccolo Machiavelli, with whom he was contemporary. For,\r\nlike the Florentine’s ideal, he was talented, learned, crafty, and\r\nunscrupulous. Had he studied in his own language that immaculate\r\nmanual of political ethics, _The Prince_, he could not have more\r\nfaithfully followed its precepts. No sooner had he assumed the sceptre\r\nthan, throwing off the mask by which he had deceived the plebeians,\r\nhe dismissed every person of that class employed about the palace,\r\nand filled all vacancies, civil and military, from the ranks of the\r\nnobles. He applied himself with energy to war and diplomacy, in both\r\nof which he was eminently successful, and raised himself and his\r\nthrone to the highest pinnacle of grandeur; whereupon he did not\r\ndisdain the title of Emperor of the World. Notwithstanding his talents\r\nand accomplishments, he was exceedingly superstitious, surpassing\r\nin this respect many of his followers, and was dependent on diviners\r\nand astrologers, appealing also to the counsels of Nezahualpilli and\r\nother prominent personages. Men, whom he knew, he did not fear; but\r\nthe gods, whom he did not know, he feared exceedingly. And because\r\nhe practised human sacrifice to propitiate them he has been called\r\ncruel, but the actions of a blind devotee of religion must not be\r\nmeasured by a too critical standard. There was nothing cruel in the\r\nwish of Caligula, however hateful and vindictive it might be, that\r\nthe Roman people had but one head, so that he might strike it off at\r\na single blow; but when he tortured men and women for amusement while\r\nat his meals, that was the quintessence of cruelty. As for honor,\r\nintegrity, and all those virtues which go to make a man, we must not\r\nexpect them in princes or in politicians; yet we may safely say that\r\nin all the generous qualities of mind and heart the Aztec monarch\r\nwas no whit behind contemporary European rulers.\r\n\r\nFrom all which it is safe to say that Montezuma, though most\r\nmagnificent and lordly among his lords, was not popular with the\r\nmasses, and his position at this juncture was not of the safest.\r\nHis extravagance exceeded all bounds; his continuous wars were\r\nexpensive; and to meet the heavy draughts upon the treasury required\r\nexcessive taxation. This was made to weigh with special heaviness on\r\nthe subjugated provinces, on which likewise was laid with peculiar\r\naggravation the horrible burden of furnishing victims for human\r\nsacrifices. The successful resistance to his arms of several states\r\nenclosed by his conquests, or bordering on his domain, caused him no\r\nsmall unhappiness. There was the little republic of Tlascala, on the\r\nvery border of the Mexican valley, which often he had tried to conquer,\r\nand failed. Then there was the Tarascan kingdom of Michoacan, on the\r\nwestern side, whose people boasted as high a culture as any of the\r\nlake region, which stood firm against all efforts of the confederation.\r\n\r\nWith nations beyond their border little intercourse existed, yet\r\nAztec traders, likewise playing spies, were often as far south as\r\nNicaragua, and along the coasts of Honduras and Yucatan. There is no\r\ndoubt, therefore, that the presence in those parts of the Spaniards\r\nwas known to Montezuma from the first. It might have been like a voice\r\nfrom behind the clouds, the reports of Columbus and Pinzon, but the\r\nappearing of Córdoba and Grijalva, who talked and drew blood, was\r\nsomething more tangible. The people of Tuito, on the west coast of\r\nMexico, held that before the conquest a vessel was lost there, from\r\nwhich had landed more than forty persons, dressed like Spaniards,\r\nand whom the natives received kindly, but finally slew because they\r\ninsisted on the worship of the cross.[138] A box thrown up by the\r\nwaves, and containing peculiar clothing, gold rings, and a sword which\r\nno one could break, was said to have been in Montezuma’s possession.\r\nVague as were these appearings, there was something painfully\r\nportentous in them.\r\n\r\nFor the chief divinity of the Nahua nations was Quetzalcoatl, the\r\ngentle god, ruler of the air, controller of the sun and rain, and\r\nsource of all prosperity. In the palmy days of the Toltecs he had\r\nbeen their king, the creator of their golden age, giving them metals,\r\nimproved government, and products of spontaneous growth; after which\r\nhe was their god, with his chief shrine at Cholula, where surrounding\r\npeoples, even those inimical to the city, maintained temples for his\r\nworship. From toward the rising sun Quetzalcoatl had come; and he\r\nwas white, with large eyes, and long black hair, and copious beard.\r\nAfter a final rule of twenty years at Cholula he set out for the\r\ncountry whence he came, and on reaching the seaboard of Goazacoalco\r\nhe sailed away on a craft of snakes. His last words were that one day\r\nbearded white men, brethren of his, perhaps he himself, would come by\r\nway of the sea in which the sun rises, and would enter in and rule\r\nthe land;[139] and from that day, with a fidelity befitting Hebrews\r\nwaiting the coming of their Messiah, the Mexican people watched for\r\nthe fulfilment of this prophecy, which promised them a gentle rule,\r\nfree from bloody sacrifices and oppression; but to their sovereign\r\nthe thought gave rise to deep apprehension, for then his own reign\r\nmust terminate.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the tidings of strange sails and bearded white men\r\non their eastern border were received at the gay capital with mingled\r\nfear and joy. And marvel-mongers went about the streets talking of\r\nthe good Quetzalcoatl and his pedigree, of the signs and wonders that\r\nhad been seen, the prodigies, oracles, and occult divinations, as\r\nin ancient Athens the old families of Olympus, with their ape-gods\r\nand bull-gods of Memphis, and the dog-headed monster Anubis, were\r\ndiscussed; and as for Rome, Lucan has recorded no omens which the\r\nsages of Mexico could not now match. To what extent the Spanish\r\nchroniclers have assisted the natives in the manufacture of marvels\r\nI leave the reader to judge, simply recommending to his consideration\r\nthe accompanying lengthy note; neither, however, fell into the madness\r\nof Canute, who chose the time the tide was rising, instead of when\r\nit was falling, to order the stay of waters.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone in Mexico, but in distant parts, and on the islands,\r\nthat man and nature were thus annoyed by the supernatural. There were\r\nfound predictions centuries old, by priests widely separated, and the\r\npoems of wise men, all pointing in the one direction. The destruction\r\nof towns was predicted by a philosopher; the famine of 1505 spoke more\r\nplainly than words; Popocatepetl, choked by consternation, failed to\r\nemit his smoke for twenty days, which, however, was a good omen; an\r\neclipse and an earthquake near together and the drowning of eighteen\r\nhundred soldiers were decidedly unfavorable. Most terrible of all,\r\nhowever, were a three-headed comet in open day, a pyramidal light\r\nat night, and other portentous scenes, such as the furious uprising\r\nof the lake, the awakening of the dead, and visits to the spirit\r\nworld.[140]\r\n\r\nTo us the most wonderful part of it is, not the wonders themselves,\r\nbut that it should so happen, if indeed it did, that these fearful\r\nforebodings, running back for generations, should all converge toward\r\nthe coming of the brethren of Quetzalcoatl at the very time the\r\nSpaniards appeared, and that the latter should be in so many respects\r\nas the good gods themselves were to have been. The prophecies of Isaiah\r\nare dim indeed and unfathomable as compared with these. To what end\r\nare signs that cannot be interpreted until after the occurrence, as is\r\ngenerally the case, when their interpretation is not needed, sages do\r\nnot say. But in this instance the testimony is abundant and explicit\r\nthat many of these prodigies were at the time received, not only\r\nby Montezuma and his people, but by the neighboring nations, as the\r\ndistinct announcement of the coming of the gods, who did in good truth\r\nappear at the proper time in the person of the Spaniards. And what\r\nshould be their doom, those stupid and profane men of Potonchan and\r\nTabasco, who had raised their hands against these heavenly messengers!\r\n\r\nWe are further assured that, prior to the arrival of any Spaniard,\r\nsome of the subjected provinces assumed an air of independence,\r\nencouraged by the fear which these occurrences produced on the Aztecs,\r\nagainst whom they were regarded as especially directed. Cuetlachtlan\r\nsorcerers having in their divining-pits conjured up visions of Mexicans\r\nacting as abject carriers to armed bearded men astride giant deer,\r\nthis people became in 1511 so insolent as to refuse the customary\r\ntribute, and even to murder the Aztec officials sent to collect it.\r\nAnd so involved was Montezuma in divers troubles that he was unable\r\nto resent the outrage.\r\n\r\nThe thought occurred to the Mexican monarch that perhaps the\r\nthreatened evils might be averted by propitiating the gods with\r\ngreater sacrifices. For this the several campaigns then waged or\r\nconcluded promised an abundance of victims; and to make the holocaust\r\nstill more imposing, it was resolved to consecrate at the same time\r\na new sacrificial stone. After diligent search a suitable stone was\r\nfound at Tenanitlan, near Coyohuacan. The sculptors having finished\r\ntheir work, and the priests theirs, with loud hosannas it was rolled\r\nalong toward the imperial city. While crossing the Xolco canal the\r\nbridge broke, and the stone sank beneath the water, dragging down\r\nthe high-priest and his attendants, “who went to hell quicker than\r\nthe stone,” comments the pious Torquemada. The stone, however, was\r\nrecovered, and consecrated on the summit of the great temple, in\r\n1512, with the blood of over twelve thousand captives.[141]\r\n\r\nAnd now Montezuma almost wishes the calamities he fears were already\r\nupon him, so full of dread and dire oppression is he. Priests, chiefs\r\nof wards, and other officials, says Tezozomoc, are commanded to\r\nascertain and impart all dreams and strange occurrences relating to\r\na coming people or to the throne. Wise and politic as he is, he does\r\nnot seem to know that this is only placing himself and his malady\r\nat the mercy of the masses. Who could not conjure up visions under\r\nsuch a summons? Some old men immediately come forward with a dream,\r\nwherein Huitzilopochtli’s image is overthrown and his temple burned\r\nto the ground, leaving no vestige. Certain hags next appear with a\r\ndream of a furious stream, which has swept away the palace and temple,\r\nforcing the lords to flee the city.\r\n\r\nThis will not do. Away with such trumpery! And so the terrified monarch\r\nhurls the evil dreamers into prison, and leaves them there to die of\r\nstarvation, while he orders on new ones in the persons of the priests\r\nand men of circumspection. But softly now. These wise ones deem it\r\nprudent not to dream at all, which course only adds suspicion to the\r\nhot anger of Montezuma. Next he calls on all astrologers, sorcerers,\r\nand diviners in the empire to dream, to cause others to dream, and\r\nto declare their dreams; to declare the secrets of the starry realms,\r\nand all things pertinent on and in this earth. Neither will these ply\r\ntheir avocation during such troublous times. Down with them, then,\r\nto the lowest depths! In prison, however, they do understand that the\r\nplanets and terrestrial phenomena combine to foreshadow extraordinary\r\noccurrences, whether for good or evil the emperor will soon enough\r\nknow. “Force them to tell; burn them else,” are the next instructions.\r\nBut the messengers find the prison, though guarded, empty. The unhappy\r\nmonarch sends to their respective towns and demolishes their houses,\r\nbut these agents of offended heaven are never seen again.[142]\r\n\r\nThis, and more of yet wilder strain continued in the note, shows at\r\nleast that prior to the coming of the Spaniards the people of the\r\nMexican valley, and their sovereign in particular, were profoundly\r\nmoved with fearful forebodings of calamity of some kind. And whether\r\nthese forebodings pointed to some strange arrival by sea or other\r\nmarvel, certain it is that they opened the door of this rich realm\r\nto the invaders.\r\n\r\nEver intent on means to propitiate the gods, Montezuma in 1517 hit\r\nupon the idea of plating the temple of Huitzilopochtli with gold set\r\nwith precious stones and feathers, and gave the order accordingly to\r\nTzompantzin, the minister of finance. Now Tzompantzin was an old and\r\nfaithful servant of the government, blunt withal, and nowise afraid\r\nto die. He was of the ancient chivalry, not wholly in sympathy with\r\nthe present régime, and did not hesitate to expostulate with his\r\nsovereign, saying that the people would be ruined by the proposed\r\ntax. “Beside,” he concluded, “Huitzilopochtli will not long be god,\r\nfor those even now are coming who will take for themselves all these\r\nriches and lord it over us forever.” That very night Tzompantzin and\r\nhis son were politely escorted across the dark river.[143]\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1518, the temple of Coatlan was dedicated, with\r\nthe usual sacrifices, the last recorded holocaust to consecrate a\r\nheathen temple. For already the white-winged vessels of Spain were\r\nat hand, having on board the messengers of a purer religion, even if\r\nit did not at once prove to be the gospel of peace to the poor Indian.\r\n\r\nPinotl, calpixque of Cuetlachtlan, was the first of Montezuma’s\r\ncaptains, according to the native record, to make observations for\r\nthe emperor of the dreaded visitants. Prompted no less by zeal in his\r\nmaster’s service than by curiosity, Pinotl, with several attendants,\r\narmed with provisions and rich mantles for presents, had mingled\r\nwith the crowd which boarded Grijalva’s vessel, and had prostrated\r\nhimself at the feet of the commander and his officers as before kings\r\nor gods.[144] The beads and other trinkets given in return for their\r\ngoods they received as priceless marks of favor from supernatural\r\npersonages. When Pinotl explained as best he was able the majesty\r\nand wealth of his sovereign, Grijalva promised to return some day and\r\nvisit him in his great city. Bearing with them paintings on _amatl_,\r\nor maguey paper, of the vessels with all their belongings, and of the\r\nsoldiers and sailors with their arms, armor, dress, and attitude, down\r\nto their very swagger, and leaving orders that the strangers should\r\nbe treated with every consideration, the chief men of the province\r\nset out by fast relays to report the awful tidings to the emperor.[145]\r\n\r\nEntering the imperial presence they prostrated their bodies to the\r\nground, which they kissed, declaring themselves worthy of death for\r\nhaving ventured unbidden before their lord, but their mission permitted\r\nno delay. “For oh! most dread sovereign,” they exclaimed, “we have\r\nseen gods! All of us here present have seen their water-houses on\r\nour shores. We have talked with them, and eaten with them, and have\r\nhandled them with our hands; we have given them gifts, and have\r\nreceived in return these priceless treasures.” Then they showed the\r\nglass beads, a specimen too often approaching the value of the gifts\r\nreceived by the strong from the weak. Montezuma sat mute, scarcely\r\nheeding the messages sent him by Grijalva, concerned most of all that\r\nvassals should not witness his dismay. Here again was his phantasy\r\nbefore him, like the shade of dead Hector before Æneas, warning him\r\nagainst hopeless resistance to the preordained fall of Troy.\r\n\r\nBidding the men retire and keep secret what they had seen, Montezuma\r\nhastily summoned his privy council,[146] King Cacama of Tezcuco, his\r\nbrother Cuitlahuatzin, lord of Itzapalapan, and laid before them\r\nthe mystery. After sage consultations, attended by divinings and\r\ncomparisons of signs, prophecies, and traditions, not unlike the\r\nmeans by which we of to-day likewise ascertain the unknowable, it\r\nwas concluded that this commander was none other than the fair-hued\r\ngod himself, who had returned to resume the throne, as he had said.\r\nTherefore resistance would be in vain; and the only proper course was\r\nto tender worthy reception and conciliate with gifts. The chiefs were\r\nsent back with orders for the governors of the coast districts[147]\r\nto report any arrival or strange occurrence. Following them was an\r\nembassy of five persons bearing rich presents, with instructions to\r\nbid the god welcome in the name of the emperor and of his court; yet\r\nthey were to watch him closely. But the embassy was too late. Grijalva\r\nhad gone.[148]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [138] When Francisco Cortés entered the town, shortly\r\n     after the fall of Mexico, he was met by a body of Indians\r\n     with their hair tonsured like priests, and with crosses\r\n     in their hands, headed by the chief in flowing white gown\r\n     and scapulary. This, they explained, had been the practice\r\n     of the shipwrecked crew, who had held up the cross as a\r\n     recourse from all danger. _Frejes_, _Hist. Conq._, 63-4.\r\n     This authority places implicit reliance in the story, and\r\n     regards the strangers as a missionary party driven from\r\n     the East Indies or China. _Jalisco_, _Mem. Hist._, 30-2.\r\n\r\n     [139] See _Native Races_, iii. and v., 25-6, for the myths\r\n     relating to Quetzalcoatl, and to their interpretation,\r\n     in which occur the characters of the Messiah and the\r\n     apostle Saint Thomas, with whom some pious chroniclers\r\n     have identified him. The Saint Thomas idea is advocated in\r\n     _Florencia_, _Hist. Prov. Comp. de Jesus_, 234.\r\n\r\n     [140] The natives of Española are said to have received\r\n     an oracle shortly before Columbus’ arrival, announcing\r\n     the coming of bearded men, with sharp, bright swords.\r\n     _Villagvtierre_, _Hist. Conq. Itza._, 33. The Yucatec\r\n     records abound in predictions to the same effect, more or\r\n     less clear. The most widely quoted is that of Chilam Balam,\r\n     high-priest of Mani, and reputed a great prophet, who\r\n     foretold that, ere many years, there would come from the\r\n     direction of the rising sun a bearded white people, bearing\r\n     aloft the cross which he displayed to his listeners. Their\r\n     gods would flee before the new-comers, and leave them to\r\n     rule the land; but no harm would fall on the peaceful who\r\n     admitted the only true God. The priest had a cotton mantle\r\n     woven, to be deposited in the temple at Mani, as a specimen\r\n     of the tribute required by the new rulers, and he it was who\r\n     erected the stone crosses found by the Spaniards, declaring\r\n     them to be the true tree of the world. Cogolludo, _Hist.\r\n     Yucathan_, 99-101, gives the prophecy at length, which is\r\n     not quite so clear as the version which he afterward quotes\r\n     from Herrera. The latter calls the priest Chilam Cambal,\r\n     and says: ‘Esta fue la causa que preguntauan a Francisco\r\n     Hernandez de Cordoua, y a los suyos, si yuan de donde nacia\r\n     el Sol.’ Dec. ii. lib. iii. cap. i. Alaman enters into a\r\n     profound argument on the above, and interprets Chilam Cambal\r\n     to be the Chinese for Saint Thomas. In seeking to give a\r\n     date he mistakes the meaning of a Yucatec age and places\r\n     the prophecy back at the beginning of the Christian era.\r\n     The opening lines of the prophecy read, ‘at the end of the\r\n     thirteenth age,’ which should be interpreted ‘at the end\r\n     of two hundred and sixty years.’ The name is also given as\r\n     Chilam Balan and Chilan Balam, the latter part savoring of\r\n     the Canaanite divinity. _Remesal_, _Hist. Chyapa_, 245-6;\r\n     _Gonzalez Dávila_, _Teatro Ecles._, i. 203-4. A priest of\r\n     Itzalan, named Patzin Yaxun Chan, is recorded as having\r\n     urged his people to worship the true god, whose word would\r\n     soon come to them; and the high-priest of the same place,\r\n     Na Hau Pech, prophesied that within four ages—a Yucatec\r\n     age equals twenty of our years—news would be brought of\r\n     the supreme God, by men who must be received as guests and\r\n     masters. Ah Ku Kil Chel, also a priest, spoke with sorrow\r\n     of ills to come upon the people from the north and from the\r\n     east. In the age following the date of his prediction no\r\n     priest would be found to explain the will of their idols.\r\n     Another temple guardian announced that in the last age\r\n     idolatry would cease, and the world would be purified by\r\n     fire. Happy he who repented! _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_,\r\n     97-101. Several prophecies therein quoted literally are\r\n     reproduced in _Villagvtierre_, _Hist. Conq. Itza._, 34-5,\r\n     which also refers to Itzan predictions.\r\n\r\n     Among the Mexicans, says Mendieta, predictions were current\r\n     some four generations before the conquest of the coming\r\n     of bearded men dressed in raiments of different color, and\r\n     with caskets on their heads. Then the idols would perish,\r\n     leaving but one supreme God; war would cease, roads would\r\n     be opened, intercourse established, and the husband would\r\n     cherish but one wife. _Hist. Ecles._, 180; _Torquemada_,\r\n     i. 235-6. This smacks of an elaboration of the Quetzalcoatl\r\n     promise. Nezahualcoyotl, the wise Tezcucan monarch, who died\r\n     in 1472, left poems in which chroniclers have discovered\r\n     vague allusions to a coming race. The reader may, perhaps, be\r\n     equally fortunate if he examine the specimens of his poems\r\n     given in _Native Races_, ii. 494-7. His son Nezahualpilli,\r\n     equally celebrated as a just king and a philosopher, versed\r\n     in the occult arts, revealed to Montezuma that, according\r\n     to his astrologic investigations, their towns would within\r\n     a few years be destroyed and their vassals decimated. This,\r\n     he added, would soon be verified by celestial signs and\r\n     other phenomena. _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 254-7. The\r\n     precursor of these harbingers of evil appears to have been\r\n     the famine of 1505, which compelled many a parent to sell his\r\n     children for the means to obtain food, while others lined\r\n     the road-side with their famished bodies. The cessation of\r\n     smoke from the volcano Popocatepetl, for twenty days, was\r\n     a feature seized upon by the diviners as a sign of relief;\r\n     and true enough, in the following year, the suffering people\r\n     were cheered with an abundant harvest. Soon again their fears\r\n     were roused by an eclipse and an earthquake, in the very\r\n     inaugural year of the new cycle, 1507, and by the drowning\r\n     of 1800 soldiers during the Miztec campaign. Almost every\r\n     succeeding year confirmed their apprehensions by one or\r\n     more signs or occurrences of an ominous nature. One of the\r\n     most alarming was the appearance, in broad day, of a comet\r\n     with three heads, which darted across the sky, eastward,\r\n     with such speed that the tails seemed to scatter sparks.\r\n     ‘Salieron cometas del cielo de tres en tres ... parecian\r\n     ... echando de sí brasas de fuego ... y llevaban grandes y\r\n     largas colas.’ _Mendieta_, _Hist. Ecles._, 179. ‘Cayó una\r\n     cometa, parecian tres estrellas.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._,\r\n     i. 4; _Native Races_, v. 466. After this, in 1507 or 1510,\r\n     a pyramidal light, which scattered sparks on all sides,\r\n     rose at midnight from the eastern horizon till its apex\r\n     reached the zenith, where it faded at dawn. This continued\r\n     for forty days, or for a year, according to some accounts.\r\n     ‘Diez años antes que viniesen los españoles ... duró por\r\n     espacio de un año cada noche.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._,\r\n     i. 3. ‘Ocho años antes de la venida de los españoles, ... y\r\n     esto se vió cuatro años.’ _Id._, _Hist. Gen._, ii. 271. It\r\n     occurred in 1509, and lasted over forty days. _Codex Tell.\r\n     Rem._, in _Kingsborough’s Mex. Antiq._, v. 154; vi. 144. The\r\n     interpreter of the Codex enters into a lengthy argument to\r\n     prove it a volcanic eruption, one of his points being that\r\n     the original picture-writing places the light as appearing\r\n     behind, or from, the mountains east of the city. In 1510,\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 278, or year five, toxtli.\r\n     _Codex Chimalpopoca_, MS.; _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._, 139.\r\n     Torquemada, who had no other authority for the preceding\r\n     comet than Herrera, considered that by the comet was meant\r\n     this light, i. 234. Humboldt suggests that the fiery pyramid\r\n     may have been a zodiacal light. Astrologers announced that\r\n     it portended wars, famine, pestilence, mortality among the\r\n     lords, every imaginable ill, in fact, and causing one general\r\n     cry of fear and lament. Montezuma himself was so troubled\r\n     that he applied for advice to Nezahualpilli, although they\r\n     had not been on speaking terms for some time. This royal\r\n     astrologer showed his apprehensions by ordering all campaigns\r\n     then upon his hands to be suspended, and announced to\r\n     his confrère that the disasters in store would be brought\r\n     upon the empire by a strange race. Montezuma expressed his\r\n     disbelief, and proposed a game of _tlachtli_ to decide the\r\n     interpretation. As if resigned to the fate predicted for\r\n     himself, and desirous of showing how little he appreciated\r\n     wealth and power, Nezahualpilli is said to have staked on\r\n     the result his kingdom against three turkey-cocks. The wager\r\n     was not so hazardous, however, as it seemed, for the king\r\n     of Tezcuco was a good player. After allowing Montezuma to\r\n     win the first two points, and raising high his hopes, he\r\n     stopped his exultation by scoring the rest for himself.\r\n     Still doubtful, Montezuma called on an astrologer famous for\r\n     his many true announcements, only to receive confirmation\r\n     of Nezahualpilli’s utterance, whereupon the irate monarch\r\n     caused the house to be pulled down over the diviner, who\r\n     perished in the ruins. _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._,\r\n     278-9; _Veytia_, _Hist. Ant. Méj._, iii. 345-7. Clavigero,\r\n     who connects the game with a comet, is quite earnest in\r\n     asserting his belief in traditions and presages of the\r\n     coming of Spaniards, as attested by native paintings and\r\n     by witnesses of high standing. ‘Se il Demonio pronosticava\r\n     le future calamità per ingannar que’ miserabili Popoli, il\r\n     pietosissimo Dio le annunziava per disporre i loro spiriti\r\n     al Vangelo.’ _Storia Mess._, i. 288-9. According to Duran,\r\n     the summoning of Nezahualpilli was due to a comet with an\r\n     enormous tail, which burst upon the view of a temple-watcher\r\n     as it rose in the east and settled above the city. Montezuma,\r\n     who had been roused to witness the phenomenon, called on\r\n     his sorcerers for an explanation, and on finding that they\r\n     had seen nothing, had them punished for their sloth. The\r\n     wise Tezcucan then came and presaged dire calamities, which\r\n     would also afflict himself. He was resigned, and would retire\r\n     to await death. This was to be the last interview between\r\n     the two kings. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 274-85. Torquemada\r\n     compares the comet to that which, according to Josephus,\r\n     lib. vii. cap. xii., presaged the entry of Titus into Judea.\r\n     When Nezahualpilli returned to his palace, a hare ran into\r\n     the halls, pursued by eager domestics, but he bade them to\r\n     leave it, saying that even so would a strange people enter\r\n     into Anáhuac without resistance. _Torquemada_, i. 211-12,\r\n     214. Bernal Diaz speaks of a round sign in the eastern\r\n     sky, of a reddish green, to which was attached a streak\r\n     extending eastward. The consequent predictions of war and\r\n     pestilence he finds fulfilled in the campaign of Cortés,\r\n     and in the smallpox epidemic introduced by Narvaez. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._ (Paris ed. 1837), iv. 460-1. Among the accounts of\r\n     celestial signs which may be based on the preceding is one\r\n     by Camargo, describing a brightness observed in the east by\r\n     the Tlascaltecs, three hours before dawn, accompanied by\r\n     a whirlwind of dust from the summit of Mount Matlalcueje.\r\n     Remesal refers probably to the same whirlwind under the guise\r\n     of a white cloud, like a pillar, which often appeared in the\r\n     east before sunrise, and afterward descended upon the cross\r\n     erected in Tlascala by the Spaniards. The natives accepted\r\n     this as an intimation that the new-comers were heaven’s\r\n     chosen people, and received the cross. _Hist. Chyapa_, 304;\r\n     _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._, 140. Gomara appears to connect\r\n     this eastern light with a thick smoke and with the fiery\r\n     pyramid, which were followed by a battle in the sky between\r\n     bodies of armed men, attended with great slaughter. Some\r\n     of the courtiers surrounding Montezuma while he observed\r\n     this phenomenon, pointed out that the arms and dress of the\r\n     victorious faction resembled those in the chest which had\r\n     been washed up on the coast. He declared his conviction,\r\n     however, that they must be relics of his divine ancestors,\r\n     not of mortal beings who fell on a battle-field, as these\r\n     forms appeared to do. He proposed, as a test, that they\r\n     should break the divine sword. This they tried, but in\r\n     vain, and remained mute with wonder at its flexibility and\r\n     strength. _Hist. Mex._, 214; _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. ii.\r\n     cap. ix. Mendieta places this sign in 1511. _Hist. Ecles._,\r\n     179. The last celestial sign, as described by Mendieta, is\r\n     a large, brilliant comet, which appeared the very year of\r\n     the Spaniards’ arrival, and remained immovable in the air\r\n     for several days. _Hist. Ecles._, 180. Before Nezahualpilli\r\n     returned to his capital, after interpreting the fiery signs,\r\n     he was feasted by Montezuma, and the two monarchs thereupon\r\n     retired to the diviners’ chamber to search into the legends\r\n     of their forefathers for further light upon the omens. From\r\n     this circumstance grew the story that the twain had made a\r\n     journey to the ancient home of their race. Nezahualpilli,\r\n     being a conjurer, took Montezuma through the air to the\r\n     Seven Caves, where they conversed with the brethren of\r\n     their ancestors. On learning that the first named was a\r\n     descendant of the great Chichimecatl Xolotl, he was offered\r\n     the government of this region, but declined, promising,\r\n     however, to return at a later date. _Torquemada_, i. 212-13.\r\n     Duran applies to the reign of Montezuma I. a similar story,\r\n     which is more appropriate to the present subject. Eager\r\n     to acquaint his ancestors with the glorious achievements\r\n     of their progeny, and to learn something of the old home,\r\n     this monarch sent a force of sixty sorcerers on a mission\r\n     to Chicomoztoc, with numerous presents for Coatlicue, the\r\n     mother of the divine Huitzilopochtli. Transforming themselves\r\n     into animals, they reached the sacred region occupied by\r\n     some Aztecs whom the god had left behind when he set out on\r\n     his career of conquest. These venerable settlers were not a\r\n     little surprised to behold in the effeminate and ephemeral\r\n     specimens before them the descendants of that doughty leader\r\n     and of his companions. On reaching the abode of the divine\r\n     mother, the sorcerers found an old woman sorrowing over her\r\n     lost son. The news of his glorious fate roused her interest,\r\n     and she was induced to reveal several prophecies by her son,\r\n     among them one concerning the coming of a strange people\r\n     to wrest the land from the Mexicans. The messengers were\r\n     dismissed with presents of food and clothing, and returned\r\n     to their master with twenty of their number missing. _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, MS., i. 467-86. Additional facts may be found in\r\n     _Native Races_, v. 422-4, etc. Another visit to the spirit\r\n     world is attributed to Papantzin, sister of Montezuma II.,\r\n     who, shortly after his accession, had married the lord\r\n     of Tlatelulco. He soon died, and after ruling for a few\r\n     years she, in 1509, followed him to the grave. She was\r\n     buried with great pomp in her garden, in a vault closed by\r\n     a flag-stone. The next morning she was discovered sitting\r\n     on the steps of the bath adjoining the vault. Her niece,\r\n     a child of five or six years, was the first to notice her.\r\n     Too young to understand what would frighten older heads, she\r\n     fearlessly approached the resurrected woman, and was told\r\n     to call Papantzin’s mayordoma. This old dame, on receiving\r\n     the summons, thought it a child’s prank, and would not\r\n     stir, but at last she yielded, and on seeing the form of\r\n     her late mistress, swooned with fear. Others proved more\r\n     courageous, and carried her into the house. Papantzin now\r\n     enjoined silence, and wished to call Montezuma, but no\r\n     one daring to appear before the cruel and superstitious\r\n     monarch, Nezahualpilli was summoned, and he brought the\r\n     brother with him to her dwelling, together with several\r\n     attendants. To them she related that, on being released\r\n     from her earthly bonds, she had entered a boundless plain,\r\n     upon a road which soon divided into several branches. On\r\n     one side was a fiercely running stream, which she attempted\r\n     to cross, but was motioned back by a youth of fine stature,\r\n     dressed in a loose robe of dazzling whiteness. His face,\r\n     bright as a star, was of fair complexion, the eyes grey,\r\n     and the forehead marked with a cross. Taking her by the\r\n     hand, he led her up the valley past heaps of dead men’s\r\n     bones, from many of which rose the sound of lament. She\r\n     also observed a number of black persons, with horns and\r\n     deer legs, building a house. As the sun rose, large vessels\r\n     could be seen ascending the river, bearing white and bearded\r\n     men in strange attire, with shining head-gear, and standard\r\n     borne aloft. They were children of the sun. The youth, in\r\n     pointing them out, said that God did not yet wish her to\r\n     pass the river, which could never be recrossed, but to wait\r\n     and bear testimony to the faith coming with these men, who\r\n     were destined to wage great wars with her people and become\r\n     their masters. The lamenting bones were her forefathers—‘who\r\n     had not received the faith,’ is the uncharitable term used\r\n     by Torquemada—suffering for their evil deeds, and the house\r\n     building was to hold the bones of those slain in battle by\r\n     the fair-faced crews. She must return to earth, await these\r\n     men, and guide her people to baptism. On being restored to\r\n     her senses from the death or trance, whatever her listeners\r\n     chose to term it, she removed the stone from the vault and\r\n     returned to her chamber. Many of those present sneered at\r\n     the story as originating in the brain of a sick woman, but\r\n     Montezuma was more deeply moved than he cared to show. He\r\n     never again saw his sister, who lived a retired life till\r\n     the arrival of the Spaniards. She then came forward, the\r\n     first woman in Tlatelulco to receive baptism, and under the\r\n     name of María Papantzin rendered good aid in the missionary\r\n     cause. This account, says Torquemada, has been taken from\r\n     old native paintings, translated and sent to Spain, and\r\n     was regarded as strictly true among the natives, Papantzin\r\n     being well known in the town. ‘Esta Señora era del numero\r\n     de los Predestinados,’ i. 238-9. Ixtlilxochitl, strangely\r\n     enough, does not refer to the resurrection. According to\r\n     him, the mother of Ixtlilxochitl, king of Tezcuco, was the\r\n     first woman baptized, and this under compulsion from her\r\n     husband. She received the name of María. After her came\r\n     Papantzin, now wife of this king, who was named Beatriz.\r\n     Cortés stood godfather to both. Sahagun refers briefly to\r\n     the resurrection of a woman of Tenochtitlan, who issued,\r\n     four days after her death, from the garden vault where\r\n     she had been deposited. Appearing before Montezuma, she\r\n     announced that with him would cease the Mexican empire,\r\n     for other people were coming to rule and settle. This woman\r\n     lived twenty-one years after this, and bore another child.\r\n     _Hist. Gen._, ii. 270-1. At this rate she must have been\r\n     alive when Sahagun arrived in the country; yet he fails to\r\n     speak of her as a princess. Boturini applies the story to a\r\n     sister of King Caltzontzin, of Michoacan, who died at the\r\n     time the Spaniards were besieging Mexico, and rose within\r\n     four days to warn her brother not to listen to the Mexican\r\n     overtures for an alliance against the white invaders. The\r\n     new-comers, she said, were destined by heaven to rule the\r\n     land, and a testimony hereof would appear on the principal\r\n     feast-day in the form of a youth, who, rising in the eastern\r\n     sky, with a light in one hand and a sword in the other,\r\n     would glide over the city and disappear in the west. This\r\n     sign appearing, the king did as she bade him, rejected\r\n     the Mexican advances, and received the Spaniards in peace.\r\n     _Catálogo_, 27-8. Clavigero censures Boturini’s work, in\r\n     this connection, as full of fables, and this after solemnly\r\n     observing that the Papantzin incident ‘fu pubblico, e\r\n     strepitoso, acaduto in presenza di due Re, e della Nobiltà\r\n     Messicana. Trovossi altresi rappresentato in alcune dipinture\r\n     di quelle Nazioni, e se ne mandò alla Corte di Spagna un\r\n     attestato giuridico.’ _Storia Mess._, i. 289-92. He places\r\n     the baptism of Papantzin in 1524. _Veytia_, _Hist. Ant.\r\n     Méj._, iii. 348-52; _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii.\r\n     125-6. Torquemada gives the story of what occurred in the\r\n     spirit land in her own words; so does Clavigero, though\r\n     he differs slightly. See also his English translation by\r\n     Cullen. As if in confirmation of her story, ominous signs\r\n     became more numerous than ever. The big lake of Mexico began\r\n     to boil and foam without apparent cause, the water rising\r\n     high within the city and creating great damage. The date\r\n     generally accepted for this occurrence is 1509, but Mendieta,\r\n     _Hist. Ecles._, 178, says 1499. The lake, like the sky, was\r\n     connected with more than one mysterious occurrence. A troop\r\n     of Huatuscan conjurers arrived shortly after this in the\r\n     imperial city to exhibit tricks, in one of which they cut\r\n     off their hands and feet, disclosing bleeding stumps, and\r\n     then replaced the members. In order to test whether this\r\n     was an illusion or not, the emperor ordered the severed\r\n     members to be thrown into boiling water before they were\r\n     returned to the performers. This unwarranted curiosity\r\n     stirred the magicians to the very core, and before retiring\r\n     they predicted that the lake would be tinged with blood, and\r\n     that their avengers would soon appear in a strange people,\r\n     the conquerors of the empire. Not long after, Montezuma\r\n     noticed streaks of blood in the lake, mingled with a number\r\n     of human heads and limbs. He called others to witness the\r\n     sight, but none save himself could see it. Sending to the\r\n     injured conjurers for an explanation, they replied that\r\n     the vision denoted great and bloody battles to be waged in\r\n     the city by the strange people. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib.\r\n     ii. cap. ix. About the same time some fishermen caught\r\n     a grey bird, like a crane, with a round comb or diadem,\r\n     resembling a mirror. On being brought before Montezuma,\r\n     he was startled by seeing reflected in this mirror the\r\n     heavenly bodies, although none appeared in the sky, for it\r\n     was yet daylight. The next moment the stars had vanished,\r\n     and in their place were seen beings, half man and half deer,\r\n     who moved about in battle array. Diviners were called to\r\n     give their explanation, but when they came the bird had\r\n     disappeared. Torquemada appears to date this as early as\r\n     1505, i. 235. _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlasc._, 139-40. Another\r\n     great bird is referred to, with a human head, which soared\r\n     above the lake uttering the prediction that speedily would\r\n     come the new rulers of the empire. Other monsters were found\r\n     in the shape of double-bodied and double-headed men, which\r\n     dissolved in the air shortly after being brought to the\r\n     sorcerers’, or black hall, of Montezuma. A horrible animal\r\n     was caught near Tecualoia. _Torquemada_, i. 214. During\r\n     all the years of these signs could be heard, at frequent\r\n     intervals, a female voice lamenting, ‘Oh, my children, all\r\n     is lost to us! My children, whither will you be taken?’\r\n     _Id._, 214, 233. A similar voice was heard before the fall\r\n     of Jerusalem. _Josephus_, lib. vii. cap. xii.; _Mendieta_,\r\n     _Hist. Ecles._, 180; _Veytia_, _Hist. Ant. Méj._, iii. 358;\r\n     _Sahagun_, _Hist. Gen._, i. 5. In 1510 the imperial city\r\n     was startled, one clear, quiet night, by a fire, which,\r\n     bursting from the heart of the timbers in the temple of\r\n     Huitzilopochtli, burned all the fiercer under the efforts\r\n     made to quench it. A precursor of this had been the fall\r\n     of a stone column close to the temple, coming no one knew\r\n     whence. ‘El chapitel de un Cú de Vitzilopuchtli, que se\r\n     llamaba Tlacoteca, se encendió.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, i.\r\n     3-4. Shortly after, the temple of the fire god Xiuhtecutli,\r\n     at Zocomolco, was stricken by lightning and burned. This\r\n     occurred without the usual accompaniment of thunder, and\r\n     with but a sprinkle of rain; many regarded it as done by\r\n     a sunbeam, and consequently as particularly ominous. ‘Los\r\n     Indios decian ... el Sol ha quemado este Templo; porque ni\r\n     hemos visto Relampago, ni hemos oido Trueno.’ _Torquemada_,\r\n     i. 214, 234. Believing, or pretending to believe, the city\r\n     attacked by enemies, the Tlatelulcans rushed to arms, for\r\n     which excess of zeal they were punished by a suspension\r\n     of all their townsmen who held positions at court. _Native\r\n     Races_, v. 461-67.\r\n\r\n     [141] Torquemada assumes that the 12,210 victims comprised\r\n     also those offered at the consecration of two new temples,\r\n     Tlamatzinco and Quauhxicalli. See _Native Races_, v. 471.\r\n     Tezozomoc relates that the laborers, after striving in vain\r\n     to move the stone from its original site, heard it utter,\r\n     in a muffled voice, ‘Your efforts are in vain; I enter not\r\n     into Mexico.’ The incident finds a parallel in the vain\r\n     effort of Tarquin to remove certain statues of the gods, to\r\n     make room for Jupiter’s temple, and in the firm adherence\r\n     of Apollo’s head to the ground, shortly before the death\r\n     of the Roman ruler. But recovering from their alarm, they\r\n     tried again, and now the stone moved almost of its own\r\n     accord. Another halt is made, a second oracle delivered, and\r\n     finally the stone reaches the bridge, where it disappears\r\n     into the water. Amid the invocation of priests, divers\r\n     descend in search, only to come back with the report that\r\n     no vestige of it is to be found; but there is a fathomless\r\n     pit extending toward Chalco. While diviners are cudgelling\r\n     their brains for clues, in comes a messenger to announce\r\n     that the stone, like the Penates of Æneas, had returned to\r\n     its original site, arrayed in all the sacrificial ornaments.\r\n     Observing in this occurrence the divine will, Montezuma let\r\n     the stone remain, and recognizing at the same time a menace\r\n     to himself, perhaps of speedy death, he ordered his statue\r\n     to be at once sculptured by the side of his predecessors,\r\n     on the rocky face of Chapultepec Hill. Tezozomoc describes\r\n     the statue. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 204-7. _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     MS., ii. 313-27. _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, i. 292-3.\r\n     Among the troubles which after this fell upon the doomed\r\n     people are mentioned: An earthquake in 1513. _Codex Tell.\r\n     Rem._, in _Kingsborough’s Mex. Antiq._, v. 154. A locust\r\n     plague. ‘Vieronse gran cantidad de mariposas, y langostas,\r\n     que passauan de buelo hàzia el Occidente.’ _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     iii. lib. ii. cap. ix. A deluge in Tuzapan, and a fall\r\n     of snow which overwhelmed the army en route for Amatlan.\r\n     While crossing the mountains, rocks and trees came tumbling\r\n     down upon them, killing a large number, while others froze\r\n     to death. Ixtlilxochitl places this in 1514. Others say\r\n     1510. During the Soconusco campaign, see _Native Races_, v.\r\n     472, the ground opened near Mexico, and threw up water and\r\n     fish. The Indians interpreted this to signify a victory,\r\n     but the lord of Culhuacan intimated, with a shake of the\r\n     head, that one force expelled another, whereat Montezuma’s\r\n     delight somewhat abated. ‘Quando prendio Cortes a entrambos,\r\n     se accordò (Montezuma) muy bien de aquellas palabras.’\r\n     _Herrera_, ubi sup.\r\n\r\n     [142] Meanwhile it came to pass that an eagle swooped down\r\n     upon a peasant at work in a field not far from Mexico,\r\n     and seizing him by the hair in full view of his neighbors,\r\n     bore him out of sight. Landed high upon a mountain, the man\r\n     found himself led by invisible hands through a dark cave\r\n     into a hall of dazzling splendor, where Montezuma lay as\r\n     if asleep. Less favored than Ganymede, he was permitted\r\n     to see no other form, but voices around explained to him\r\n     that this was a representation of the emperor intoxicated\r\n     with pride and blinded by vanity. Tezozomoc writes that the\r\n     eagle assumed the form of a lord and spoke; but a superior\r\n     being can hardly be supposed to have assumed the office\r\n     of carrying a low peasant. A lighted pipe with a rose was\r\n     placed in his hand, with orders to burn a mark upon the\r\n     monarch’s leg, and then proceed to court and relate to him\r\n     what had occurred, pointing out the blister in testimony.\r\n     The gods were annoyed at his conduct and rule, which had\r\n     evoked the ills soon to overthrow him. Let him amend and\r\n     use well the short term still allotted to him. The next\r\n     moment the peasant found himself borne through the air\r\n     by the eagle, which enjoined upon him to obey the command\r\n     received. The man did so, and Montezuma, recalling a dream\r\n     to the same effect, looked and found a wound, which now\r\n     began to burn painfully. Throwing the man into prison as\r\n     an evil sorcerer, he sought his doctors for relief. ‘Lo\r\n     que vio el labrador, pudo ser que aconteciesse en vision\r\n     imaginatiua porque ... no es increyble que Dios por medio\r\n     de vn Angel bueno ordenasse ... que aquel auiso se diesse.’\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. ii. cap. ix. Montezuma now resolved\r\n     to seek a refuge where none of the threatened evils might\r\n     reach him. The place selected was Cicalco, ‘house of the\r\n     rabbit,’ painted by the myths as an abode of delight,\r\n     abounding in every product, sown with flowers, and flowing\r\n     with crystal waters, a place where death never entered.\r\n     As a preliminary step four human victims were flayed and\r\n     their spirits sent to Huemac, the ruler of that region, to\r\n     prepare the way for the living messengers. These consisted\r\n     of sorcerers, accompanied by dwarfs and hunchbacks to carry\r\n     the flayed skins as presents. Two hunchbacks were sent with\r\n     the skins of ten flayed men, says Duran. Entering the cave\r\n     leading to Cicalco, they were guided by its guardian into\r\n     the bowels of the earth, and presented themselves before\r\n     the Aztec Pluto. With humble reverence they proffered the\r\n     skins with the prayer of Montezuma for admission into that\r\n     abode of delight and into his service. Unwilling to make\r\n     an exception to the rule for admission through death’s\r\n     portals, Huemac sent the messengers back with presents,\r\n     giving the evasive reply that their master should confide to\r\n     him his sorrows and await relief. On receiving this report\r\n     Montezuma angrily ordered the men to be cast into prison,\r\n     and sent other messengers with fresh skins, repeating his\r\n     request for admission, yet conforming in so far as to ask\r\n     for an explanation of the many signs abroad. Huemac, again\r\n     avoiding a direct answer, told them that Cicalco was quite\r\n     a different place from what they supposed it to be. He\r\n     and his comrades stayed not of their own accord, but were\r\n     kept there by a superior power, steeped in abject toil\r\n     and misery. This unsatisfactory report entailed upon the\r\n     messengers the same punishment as before. Two Acolhuan chiefs\r\n     were now entrusted with fresh skins and the request that\r\n     Huemac should at least explain the signs which threatened\r\n     the emperor, if he still refused him admission. Among these\r\n     signs is mentioned a white cloud rising at midnight toward\r\n     the sky. Propitiated by the higher rank or qualities of\r\n     these messengers, or by the earnest perseverance of their\r\n     master, Huemac explained that the sufferings and menaces\r\n     were the result of his pride and cruelty. Let him amend,\r\n     and as a preliminary task begin a fast of eighty days.\r\n     This accomplished, Huemac would meet him at Tlachtonco, on\r\n     the summit of Chapultepec. Montezuma was so delighted with\r\n     this answer that he rewarded the chiefs most liberally, and\r\n     made the necessary arrangements for the government of the\r\n     empire during his seclusion. Going at the appointed time to\r\n     Tlachtonco, a brilliant stone ordered him to make certain\r\n     preparations and return in four days, when he would be\r\n     conducted to Cicalco. This he did, after enjoining secrecy\r\n     upon all who had assisted in the matter. Arrayed in a human\r\n     skin adorned with precious stones, gold, and feathers, he\r\n     seated himself upon a feathered throne, surrounded by his\r\n     richly dressed dwarf and hunchback pages, and in this guise\r\n     awaited Huemac. Soon a light in the distance, brilliant as\r\n     the sun, announced the approach of the mysterious being,\r\n     and hope leaped high in Montezuma’s breast. It stopped,\r\n     however, and the emperor was devoured by anxiety. Suddenly\r\n     a human voice recalled him from his absorption. It was\r\n     that of the guardian of Tzoncoztli temple, who related that\r\n     Huemac, interdicted by supreme command from approaching the\r\n     emperor, had commissioned him to recall his master to duty.\r\n     His presence is needed in Mexico to direct public affairs\r\n     and to infuse respect among the hostile nations, who would\r\n     rise the moment his disappearance became known. What will\r\n     his subjects think? He must obey the divine command, and\r\n     remember that he is emperor of the world. Montezuma yielded\r\n     reluctantly and reëntered his palace, taking to his side\r\n     the faithful Tzoncoztli guardian, and charging all to keep\r\n     the secret. _Tezozomoc_, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 213-27; and in\r\n     _Kingsborough’s Mex.

Conq._, i. 5.\r\n\r\n     [145] According to Tezozomoc, an Indian, with ears, thumbs,\r\n     and big toes cut off, arrived from Mictlancuauhtla with the\r\n     report that he had seen a round mountain on the sea moving\r\n     to and fro without approaching the shore. The informant\r\n     was placed under guard, and a chief with an attendant sent\r\n     to Pinotl to verify the statement, and to chide him for\r\n     neglect to report. They soon returned to say that from a\r\n     tree they had seen two such mountains or towers, from one\r\n     of which a canoe had set out on a fishing trip. The men on\r\n     board had white faces and hands, long, thick beard, long\r\n     hair, raiments of varied and brilliant colors, and round\r\n     head-covering. The mutilated Indian being now called to\r\n     answer further questions, his prison cell was found vacant.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, ii. 232-4; _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii.\r\n     359-77.\r\n\r\n     [146] _Torquemada_, i. 379, names ten members, while Veytia,\r\n     _Hist. Ant. Méj._, iii. 378, says there were twelve.\r\n\r\n     [147] Particularly at Nauhtla, Toztla, Mictla, and Quauhtla.\r\n     _Torquemada_, i. 379; Sahagun, _Hist. Conq._, i. 6, calls the\r\n     districts Cuextecatl, Naulitlantoztlan, and Mictlanquactla.\r\n     _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 49, writes\r\n     more correctly Nauthtlan, Tochtlan, and Mictlan-Quauhtla.\r\n\r\n     [148] Torquemada, i. 379-80, expresses his disapproval of\r\n     Gomara and Herrera for following only Spanish versions, and\r\n     ignoring the Indian records acquired by himself and others,\r\n     including Sahagun. The latter assumes that Montezuma has been\r\n     apprised of Grijalva’s departure before the embassy leaves,\r\n     and this body is therefore not sent till Cortés arrives.\r\n     _Hist. Conq._, i. 7. This is not unlikely, for council\r\n     had to be first held and the future course determined,\r\n     and messengers were always on the way between the subject\r\n     provinces and the capital, ready to convey news. But most\r\n     writers, followed by the _Native Races_, take the view\r\n     presented in the text. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap.\r\n     ix., who is very brief on Grijalva’s visit, says, when it\r\n     was learned that the Spaniards wanted gold, the governors\r\n     on the coast were ordered to barter with it, and to find\r\n     out what further object they had in coming. Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     states that merchants from the coast fair brought the first\r\n     news of Grijalva to Mexico. Veytia, _Hist. Ant. Méj._,\r\n     iii. 377-8, is brief on the subject. Tezozomoc describes\r\n     the necklace, bracelet, and other jewelry prepared as\r\n     presents by four of the leading goldsmiths and lapidaries.\r\n     With these the chief who had been to the coast to observe\r\n     the floating towers is ordered to seek the white men.\r\n     Pinotl must prepare food for them, and if they eat, they\r\n     are surely Quetzalcoatl and his suite. ‘But if they prefer\r\n     human flesh,’ says Duran, in his version, ‘and wish to eat\r\n     you, let them do so; I promise to look to the future of\r\n     your children and relatives.’ _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 366-7.\r\n     ‘If you are convinced that it is Quetzalcoatl,’ continued\r\n     Montezuma, ‘adorn his person with these jewels made for\r\n     the purpose, and say that I beg him humbly to come and take\r\n     possession of the throne which I hold for him.’ _Tezozomoc_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, ii. 236-9. This author confounds Grijalva\r\n     and Cortés, but allows the jewels and message to reach the\r\n     latter. According to Duran, Montezuma tells the chief to\r\n     ask the god for permission to finish his rule; after his\r\n     death he is welcome to the throne. ‘Que me dege morir, y\r\n     que despues de yo muerto venga muy de norabuena, y tome su\r\n     Reyno pues es suyo y lo dejó en guarda á mis antepasados,’\r\n     ut supra. Acosta, _Hist. Ind._, 508-14 refers briefly to\r\n     this subject, and to the various omens and visions, some\r\n     of which he regards as dreams imparted by angels. Meanwhile\r\n     fresh messengers arrive to report that the white captain had\r\n     spread the wings of his floating mountains and faded away\r\n     in the east. They bring later drawings and gifts, including\r\n     beads, shirts, a hat, some biscuits and wine. The monarch\r\n     crunches the biscuits and admits them to be good, but the\r\n     wine, with its penetrating sweetness, lulling the senses and\r\n     calling up happy visions, this delights him, and specimens\r\n     of both are deposited upon the altar of Quetzalcoatl at\r\n     Tula. Finally, on seeing the glass necklace, he declares the\r\n     giver to be indeed the Acatl Ynacuitl, the travelling god\r\n     of the reed; and deeming himself unworthy of so brilliant\r\n     an adornment, he consecrates it to the gods. The best\r\n     painters are called to give a superior representation of\r\n     the strange visitors from the rude drawings brought by the\r\n     messengers, and from their description, while the old and\r\n     wise men are asked for recollections and ideas which may\r\n     throw light upon the subject. After much search a tradition\r\n     is raked up, wherein a race is to come from the east mounted\r\n     on serpents or masted mountains, and with them a white,\r\n     bearded people, astride of big deers and eagles, who will\r\n     land at Tzonapan, and obtain possession of all the land.\r\n     They are also described as a one-legged people, with the\r\n     face in the middle of the body, of white complexion and\r\n     with long beard. In confirmation thereof is produced an\r\n     old painting, which agrees with those depicting the late\r\n     arrivals. Convinced of the identity, Montezuma orders the\r\n     governors of the coast provinces to maintain a close watch\r\n     for the return of the strangers, so that he may receive\r\n     speedy notice. _Tezozomoc_, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 241-50;\r\n     _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 359-92.\r\n\r\n     This chapter presents but a faint picture of the state of\r\n     affairs within the Mexican empire at the time of the arrival\r\n     of Cortés. As I said at the outset, all this I have given\r\n     in my _Native Races_, and can not of course repeat it here.\r\n     Further authorities on omens and on the state of the Aztec\r\n     empire, most of them, however, of no value, are _Carbajal\r\n     Espinosa_, _Hist.

The ships had been watched\r\nfrom afar by expectant eyes; and now from the wondering multitude\r\nthat lines the Chalchiuhcuecan[149] shore come two large canoes,\r\nwhose occupants step to the deck of the flag-ship and reverentially\r\nask for the Tlatoani. Their language is new to Aguilar; none of the\r\ncompany can understand it. What is to be done? Modestly speaks one of\r\nthe female slaves, “These are Mexicans, sent by Cuitlalpitoc,[150]\r\ncacique of the nearest town, to welcome the white chief and offer\r\ntheir devotion. They would likewise know whence he comes, and why.”\r\n\r\nInstantly all eyes are on the speaker, who under their continued gaze\r\ndraws back, abashed at her own temerity, while the warm blood mantles\r\nbeneath its clear olive confine, and the breath comes inconstant\r\nbetween parted lips. Cortés regards her as she stands there unconscious\r\nof the important service she has rendered him; for possessed she the\r\npower of Thetis, to assume any form she pleased, the fair interpreter\r\ncould not at this juncture have appeared before the chief in any other\r\naspect half so fascinating. Who is she? The one baptized Marina,\r\nat Tabasco; and who, being the greatest lady there, was given to\r\nPuertocarrero, the greatest gentleman present. Why had she been given\r\nto Puertocarrero? Why had not the chief chamberer himself taken her?\r\nCortés had weightier matters on his mind. He was playing for empire,\r\nand would not now stop to divide the petty winnings with his men. By\r\nand by right royally will he reward the unsanctified within him for\r\nits abstinence. As for this girl, he seems now for the first time to\r\nsee her.[151] Had Marina, the slave, been born in other lands, under\r\ndifferent auspices, to what exalted sphere might not her personal\r\nloveliness and beauty of character have entitled her!\r\n\r\nThey say she was fair for an Indian; very beautiful she certainly is,\r\nand of that order of loveliness that captivates the understanding no\r\nless than the passions. The old as well as the young are ravished\r\nwith her beauty, even as with Helen were the elders of Troy. She\r\nis about eighteen, and in form and features perfect; her long hair\r\nfalling over smooth, round shoulders, and from large lustrous eyes\r\nradiating a tender melancholy that overspreads the face and tones to\r\nharmony whatever falls beneath its influence. Sweet and frank in her\r\ndisposition, she is nevertheless resolute enough upon occasion; yet\r\nin her ordinary mood there is a rare grace and femininity, in which\r\nshe is as liquid and pellucid as a passage in Herodotus. There is\r\nno shame in her blush, nothing bordering on conscious inferiority in\r\nher bearing; nothing that these or any other beings may do unto her\r\ncan lessen her self-respect. She scarcely knows she is a slave, the\r\nplaything of passion; she finds the world made so, men the stronger\r\nand wickeder, and she has but to acquiesce.[152]\r\n\r\nCortés is deeply interested. As if from heaven some bright being\r\nhad been sent to his assistance, so comes to him Marina now. What is\r\nher history? Strangely romantic. She is the daughter of a cacique,\r\nborn at Painala, eight leagues from Goazacoalco. While yet a child\r\nher father died; and upon a son, the fruit of a second marriage, the\r\nmother centred all her affections. To secure to him the succession and\r\ninheritance which rightly belonged to the daughter, Marina was given\r\nas a slave to some travelling merchants of Xicalanco, while a slave\r\ngirl who had just died was passed off for Marina and buried with the\r\nusual stately ceremonies.[153] Arrived at Tabasco, Marina was sold\r\nto the cacique, and by him transferred to the Spaniards. With a mind\r\nelastic and quick to learn, to her native Mexican tongue she added\r\nat Tabasco a knowledge of the Maya, becoming afterward proficient in\r\nSpanish. And now no longer slave, save to the passion love, she is\r\nto queen it for a while as consort of the conqueror, becoming in the\r\nconquest second only in power and importance to Cortés himself, whom\r\nwith her whole soul she loves, and to whom alone she clings after\r\nthe departure presently of Puertocarrero for Spain. Accompanying the\r\ninvaders as interpreter and adviser, she shares their hardships and\r\nrejoices in their successes. For is not the daring commander lord\r\nof her heart and person? Moreover, what claim upon her has a nation\r\nwhich drives her into solitude beyond its border, and for no crime?\r\nTherefore, if her newly found friends sicken, she nurses them; if\r\nthey despair, she comforts them. Nevertheless she cannot forget her\r\npeople, but freely exerts her influence in their behalf, saving many\r\na life and many a town from destruction. Toward the end both races\r\nvie in showing her their admiration, gratitude, and respect; and\r\nalthough to the Indian the invaders become more and more objects of\r\nexecration, yet he never mentions with aught but loving reverence the\r\nname Malintzin, or Malinche, as in his tongue is called Marina.[154]\r\n\r\nTo the embassy of Cuitlalpitoc Cortés makes friendly answer. He\r\nwill explain his purposes to the cacique in person. Meanwhile the\r\nmessengers are regaled with food; presents are given them, and gold\r\nis shown as something Spaniards delight in. Then they return to the\r\nshore, which appears not very inviting, with its broad reach of sand\r\nand sandy hillocks whirled up by the northers. Likewise vegetation\r\nhereabout is stunted, larger trees appearing only in the distance.\r\nThe place had been recommended by Grijalva, however, as possessing\r\ngood anchorage, and the people as being rich and hospitable.[155]\r\n\r\nEarly on Good Friday Cortés landed, planted guns upon the hillock,\r\nand began the construction of a fortified camp, consisting of houses,\r\nhuts, and sheds, high in the centre of which was placed a large cross.\r\nInformed of this, the cacique sent men to carry timber, plaster the\r\nwalls, and put up awnings. Food was also provided, and feather-work\r\nand gold were presented Cortés, with the information that the governor\r\nwould visit him presently. Meanwhile the natives flocked in to trade,\r\nso that on Saturday the place presented the appearance of a fair,\r\nrather than the encampment of an invading army.\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday, while preparations were made for mass, Cuitlalpitoc\r\narrived with his chief, Teuhtlile, governor of the province, whose\r\nresidence was at Cuetlachtlan, eight leagues away.[156] Attending\r\nthem was a large retinue of nobles, and slaves[157] bearing presents.\r\nCortés, with an escort, advanced to receive them, and after interchange\r\nof courtesies led the way to the altar, draped in native cotton\r\nfabrics, where Father Olmedo celebrated mass,[158] aided by Father\r\nJuan Diaz, Aguilar, and a trained choir. The service over, Cortés\r\ninvited the chiefs to dinner, and there informed them that he was\r\na captain of the greatest monarch the sun smiled on, Charles V. of\r\nSpain, who, hearing of Montezuma’s fame, had sent him presents and\r\na message, which must be delivered in person immediately.[159] How\r\neasy the way to him who knows it! Had Cortés but spoken the simple\r\nword, “I am Quetzalcoatl, come to resume my rule,” he might possibly\r\nat one time have ridden midst hosannas to the capital, and seated\r\nhimself without resistance on Montezuma’s throne.\r\n\r\nBut the minion of an earthly monarch is quite a different being from\r\nthe fair god in the eyes of the Aztec officers, who answer somewhat\r\nhaughtily, “Be it known to you that our master is the inferior of none;\r\nand for the present let these gifts suffice.” Saying which the signal\r\nis given; the slaves advance and deliver their burdens, consisting\r\nin part of food, cotton fabrics more than ten bales, brilliant\r\nfeather-work, and a cacaxtli, or basket, filled with wrought gold\r\nset with rare stones and pearls. Cortés expressed thanks, and gave\r\nfor Montezuma in return a carved and inlaid arm-chair, some engraved\r\nmarcasite laid in musk-scented cotton, a bright red cap, a gold medal\r\nstamped with the figures of St George and the dragon, twisted strings\r\nof beads, and other articles; and would the emperor deign to wear the\r\ncap and occupy the chair when it became his pleasure to receive him?\r\nTo the chiefs were also given some trifles. Teuhtlile promised to\r\ndeliver to Montezuma the gifts and the message. Then pointing to the\r\ngilt helmet of a soldier, which resembled in form the head-dress of\r\nthe idol Quetzalcoatl, he expressed a desire to show it to Montezuma.\r\n“Take it,” said Cortés, “and bring it back filled with gold-dust,\r\nthat we may show our emperor what kind of metal you have.”[160]\r\n\r\nObserving the native painters transcribing to amatl-paper the several\r\nnovelties, and wishing to impress them further, Cortés mounted a horse,\r\nand ordered the troops to fall into line and the cannons to be charged.\r\nThe infantry first passed in review to the sound of music with arms\r\nand banners displayed. Then came the cavalry with the best riders,\r\nled by Alvarado, dashing past in varied and swift evolutions. The\r\ngraceful movements of the great animals, their rearing and prancing,\r\nand above all their speed; the flashing swords, the glittering armor,\r\nall seemed to these simple people like a scene from the supernatural.\r\nTheir admiration was changed to terror, however, when the guns belched\r\nflames and smoke, and sent midst many thunderings the stone balls\r\nscudding along the beach or crashing among the trees. All, even their\r\nown fears, were faithfully depicted by the painters. On leaving,\r\nTeuhtlile gave orders to supply the Spaniards with every necessary, for\r\nwhich purpose two thousand of his people were detailed to attend them,\r\nparticularly to bring wood, water, and food. For their accommodation\r\nanother cluster of huts was erected, so that within these few days\r\ntwo towns arose on the sands of Chalchiuhcuecan. Cuitlalpitoc, who\r\nremained for a time to superintend the service, received from his\r\nguests the name of Ovandillo.[161]\r\n\r\nMontezuma was quickly in possession of all these facts; and when he\r\nsaw the gifts, and read the picture writings, and learned how a woman,\r\nbeautiful as the sun, talked to his people in their own language;\r\nmore particularly when he compared the helmet with that worn by\r\nHuitzilopochtli, and was told that the terrible strangers insisted\r\non an interview, apprehension filled his soul.[162] Cuitlahuatzin,\r\nhis brother, and Cacama of Tezcuco, were summoned to aid in telling\r\nhim what to do. The council was divided. There was the popular\r\nbelief regarding Quetzalcoatl with its attendant prognostics; on the\r\nother hand these strangers did not behave like gods. They had human\r\nappetites, overthrew the idols, claimed allegiance to another power,\r\nand had proved themselves vulnerable at Potonchan. Yet could beings\r\nwholly terrestrial so live without women, mount gigantic deer, and tame\r\nthe lightning? Cacama thought they should have a hearing. The national\r\nhonor demanded it; beside, refusal implied fear. Cuitlahuatzin saw\r\nin the visitation only evil to the commonwealth, and urged expulsion.\r\nThe gods should decide; and very foolish gods they would have been to\r\nvote admission to their destroyers. And now behold the fatal folly of\r\nMontezuma! Instead of vigorous action toward the end determined on,\r\nhe adopted a middle course. He would decline the interview, yet not\r\nrudely drive the strangers hence, lest, peradventure, they might be\r\ngods and successfully oppose him. He would send them liberal gifts,\r\nand beseech them to depart, thus exposing at once his weakness and\r\nhis wealth.[163]\r\n\r\nA diplomate of the first nobility was accordingly despatched to the\r\nsea-shore. With him went Teuhtlile, returning after only a week’s\r\nabsence.[164] Numerous natives were in attendance, among them over\r\na hundred slaves. Bowing low before Cortés, who had on this occasion\r\nput on greater pomp than usual, the envoy touched the earth with his\r\nhand, carrying it to his lips, and then he swung the copal censer.[165]\r\nTogether with Teuhtlile he thereupon seated himself beside Cortés;\r\nand it was remarked how much alike they looked, the Spanish commander\r\nand the Aztec envoy, who, perhaps, had been selected for this reason,\r\nwith the aid of the portraits made by the native painters, and as a\r\nmark of honor to the white captain. The soldiers not inappropriately\r\ncalled him the Mexican Cortés.[166]\r\n\r\nThe slaves were then directed to lay down the presents; among which\r\nwere thirty bales of cotton fabrics, from gauzy curtains to heavy\r\nrobes, white, colored, plain, and figured,[167] interwoven with\r\nfeathers or embroidered with gold and silver thread; feathers and\r\nplumes of all colors, embroidered sandals, and marcasite mirrors.\r\nAll these, however, were trifles beside the gold, the beautiful\r\nglittering gold which was now disclosed, and likewise the silver.\r\nFirst there was a disk of the yellow metal, representing the sun\r\nwith its rays, as large as a carriage wheel, ten spans in diameter,\r\nornamented in demi-relief and valued at thirty-eight hundred pesos\r\nde oro.[168] A companion disk of solid silver, of the same size,\r\nand equally ornamented, represented the moon.[169] Then there were\r\nthirty golden ducks, well fashioned; a number of other pieces in form\r\nof dogs, lions, monkeys, and other animals; ten collars, a necklace\r\nwith over one hundred pendent stones called emeralds and rubies by\r\nthe Spaniards; twelve arrows, a bow with cord stretched, two staves\r\neach five palms in length; fans, bracelets, and other pieces, all\r\nof fine gold, beside a number of silver. What could have delighted\r\nthe Spaniards more? One thing only, and that was not wanting—the\r\ngilt helmet returned full of virgin gold, fine dust and coarse,\r\nwith a plentiful mixture of nuggets of various sizes and shapes, all\r\nfresh from the placers. The value of this was three thousand pesos,\r\nand appreciation was attracted not so much by the amount as by the\r\nsignificance of the gift, as Bernal Diaz remarks, for it afforded a\r\nsure indication of the existence of rich mines in the country. “It\r\nwas this gift which cost Montezuma his head,”[170] says Torquemada.\r\n\r\nThe words which followed fell on closed ears. These so greatly admired\r\ngifts are but a slight token of the high regard of the emperor, who\r\nwould be pleased to form a friendship with his king; but he could not\r\nthink of troubling Cortés to come to him through a hostile country;\r\nbesides, he was ailing. Everything the visitors might wish to aid their\r\ndeparture would be instantly supplied. This and more. Poor, foolish\r\nmonarch! As well might he ask the ravenous wolf to depart after giving\r\nit to lick a little blood from his scratched hand. For the gifts, a\r\nthousand thanks; but after so long a voyage, undertaken solely for\r\nthe purpose, the Spanish captain dared not face his master without\r\nhaving seen the great Montezuma. As for the road, its difficulties\r\nor dangers were nothing. Would the chiefs present their monarch these\r\nfurther articles, and bring speedy answer?[171]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile discussion was in order among the Spaniards, and speculation\r\nas to what should be done. Some advised immediate advance on\r\nMontezuma’s capital; some, fearful of the nation’s strength, as\r\nmanifested by its arts and refinements, favored return to Cuba for\r\nreinforcements. Cortés let them talk, but said little. Traffic at\r\nfirst was freely permitted among the men,[172] and as the result\r\nwas meagre Cortés did not think it worth while to require of them\r\na division. To this irregularity certain of the Velazquez leaders\r\nobjected, demanding at least that the royal fifth should be deducted;\r\nthe commander therefore ordered gold to be received only by Gonzalo\r\nMejía, as treasurer.[173]\r\n\r\nTen days elapsed before Teuhtlile returned, without the envoy,[174]\r\nbut followed by a file of slaves bearing, among other things, as a\r\npresent to the Spanish king, ten loads of rich feathers and robes,\r\nsome gold figures valued at three thousand pesos, and four chalchiuite\r\nstones, each declared to be worth a load of gold, but of no value to\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\nTeuhtlile then stated that further messages to the emperor were\r\nuseless, since the desired interview could not be granted. He hoped\r\nthe Spaniards would content themselves with the promised supplies\r\nand depart in peace.\r\n\r\nTurning to his companions, Cortés said: “Truly this must be a great\r\nlord, and rich; and, God willing, some day we will visit him.” Just\r\nthen the bell struck for Ave María, and instantly, with uncovered\r\nheads, the soldiers were kneeling round the cross. The priests, ever\r\nready to preach their faith where an opportunity presented, were soon\r\nat work. His words, however, made a bad impression on the governor,\r\nas had also the evasive answer of Cortés to his message. He bade\r\na cold farewell, and the next morning the Spaniards awoke to find\r\nthe native encampment deserted, and even the supplies carried away.\r\nPrecautions were now taken against probable attack, by sending on\r\nboard the provisions and all cumbrous articles, leaving embarkation\r\neasy at any moment.[175]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [149] See _Native Races_, iv. 434. Duran’s native records\r\n     call this the ‘port’ of Chalchuihqueyacan. _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     MS., ii. 389. The spelling by different authorities differs\r\n     greatly. Clavigero, and Veytia, _Hist. Ant. Méj._, iii. 377,\r\n     give April 21 as the date of arrival, while Bustamante, in\r\n     _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._ (ed. Mex. 1845), 135, makes it the\r\n     22d.

To call women loose comes well\r\n     from men who spend their lives in making them so. If, as\r\n     has been stated, the women of her native district have\r\n     borne a reputation not altogether enviable, whose fault is\r\n     it? Not theirs, truly. That this girl was the mistress of\r\n     men, under the circumstances, detracts not one iota from\r\n     her good name in the minds of right-thinking persons; nay,\r\n     it detracts nothing from her purity of mind, her honesty,\r\n     or her innate morality. ‘Reprehensible medio de asegurarla\r\n     en su fidelidad,’ says Solis, _Hist. Conq. Mex._, i. 119,\r\n     otherwise so ready to cover up the defects of his hero.\r\n\r\n     [153] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 24-5. According to\r\n     Gomara she was born in Viluta, in the direction of Jalisco,\r\n     the daughter of rich parents, related to the cacique.\r\n     From them she was stolen by traders and sold in Xicalanco.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 40. The town and district may be a corruption\r\n     of Huilotlan, in Xalatzinco, which Ixtlilxochitl, _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 287, gives as her native place, and this may be\r\n     identical with the present Oluta or Holuta, near Acayucan,\r\n     on the isthmus of Tehuantepec. Painala is no longer known.\r\n     Fossey, who travelled through the region, states that\r\n     tradition makes Xaltipan or Altipan her birthplace, and in\r\n     support of this belief a mountain is pointed out, close to\r\n     the town, bearing the name of Malinche. _Mexique_, 26-7;\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._ (Bustamante ed.), i. 41; _Berendt_, in\r\n     _Salazar_, _Méx. en 1554_, 178; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. v.\r\n     cap. vi.; Sahagun, _Hist. Conq._ i. 15, mentions Teticpac,\r\n     and Oviedo names Mexico as Marina’s native place, iii.\r\n     259, while Saavedra undertakes to reconcile the different\r\n     statements by supposing that her family came originally\r\n     from Jalisco, west of Anáhuac, to Mexico city, and thence\r\n     to Goazacoalco. Her high intelligence indicates that she\r\n     was educated in the capital. _Dic. Univ._, ix. 774.\r\n\r\n     [154] Mexicans being unable to pronounce the ‘r,’ Marina\r\n     became Malina, to which the _tzin_ was added in respect,\r\n     equivalent to doña or lady. Malinche was a Spanish\r\n     corruption, which was at times applied by the Indians to\r\n     Cortés, as the lord and companion of Marina, and Juan Perez\r\n     de Arteaga had also the appellation added to his name, from\r\n     being so often with her. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     52. Another conjecture is that her original name was Malina,\r\n     or Malinalli, signifying ‘twisted thing,’ the term for one\r\n     of the Mexican days, applied in accordance with a native\r\n     custom of giving children the name of their birthday. The\r\n     name indeed is not uncommon, the lord of Tlachquiauhco, for\r\n     instance, being called Malinal or Malinaltzin. _Vetancvrt_,\r\n     _Teatro Mex._, ii. 31, 40. On finding her own name so similar\r\n     to Marina, the Spanish priest gave her this at the font.\r\n     The Indians usually acquired a surname after they grew up,\r\n     and Tenepal is that found for Marina. _Sigüenza y Góngora_,\r\n     _Paraiso Occid._, 38; _Salazar y Olarte_, _Conq. Mex._, 217;\r\n     _Arróniz_, _Orizaba_, 171, 182. To Cortés she bore a son,\r\n     who was recognized by his father and raised to the rank\r\n     of a knight of Santiago. While on the way with Cortés to\r\n     Honduras, in 1524, she was legally married to Captain Juan\r\n     Jaramillo. This took place at Ostoticpac, near Orizaba, and\r\n     excited no little comment. Some believe that the arrival of\r\n     Cortés’ wife was the cause of the marriage; but although\r\n     this may have led to his separation from Marina, it could\r\n     not have affected the marriage, since the wife was already\r\n     dead. Cortés no doubt found her an incumbrance, and sought to\r\n     be rid of it in a manner honorable to her at least. Gomara\r\n     accuses him of having made Jaramillo drunk for the purpose.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 251; but this Bernal Diaz corrects. He knew\r\n     one of the witnesses at the ceremony. _Hist. Verdad._, 25.\r\n     Jaramillo had achieved a certain prominence as commander of\r\n     one of the brigantines which aided in the siege of Mexico,\r\n     and in other affairs, and is said to have been an hidalgo.\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl marries her to Aguilar, probably because this\r\n     seemed a fit union. _Hist. Chich._, 287. _Camargo_, _Hist.\r\n     Tlax._, 143. Shortly after her marriage the army halted at\r\n     Goazacoalco, whither all the chiefs of the neighborhood were\r\n     summoned to tender submission and to receive instruction in\r\n     the faith. Among them was a young cacique with his mother,\r\n     whose resemblance to Marina at once called the attention of\r\n     all acquainted with the story, and led to her recognition\r\n     as the heartless parent. The old dame feared for her life,\r\n     but Marina reassured her with tender caresses, excusing her\r\n     conduct as controlled by the deceased stepfather, and cheered\r\n     her with a number of presents. She presented her husband, and\r\n     referred with fond pride to the son she had given to Cortés.\r\n     Both mother and half-brother accepted baptism, he receiving\r\n     the name of Lázaro, and she that of Marta, an appropriate\r\n     name for one who perhaps lived long enough to lament the\r\n     ruin of her people and country, an indirect result of her\r\n     unnatural treatment of Marina. Bernal Diaz, who witnessed\r\n     all this, and became further acquainted with the family,\r\n     declares Gomara wrong, and says: ‘Conoci á su madre, y á\r\n     su hermano,’ concluding ‘todo esto que digo, se lo oî muy\r\n     certificadamente, y se lo jurò, amen.’ _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     25; _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 12-14; _Cogolludo_,\r\n     _Hist. Yucathan_, 38. Returning to Mexico, she received\r\n     lands there and in her native province, but took up her\r\n     residence in the capital, where her husband held a prominent\r\n     position through his wealth and offices, such as regidor and\r\n     as the first alférez of the city. ‘Recibieron pʳ Alferes\r\n     de esta Ciudad a Juan Xaramillo.’ ‘Primer Alferes.’ _Libro\r\n     de Cabildo_, MS., 216. Reference is made to lots and other\r\n     grants made to him and his wife Doña Marina, on March 14,\r\n     1528, and other dates. _Id._ Both held repartimientos, one\r\n     of which lay in Xilotepec. Marina appears to have been still\r\n     living in Mexico city in 1550, impressing her memory upon\r\n     the hearts of the grateful people, over whose welfare she\r\n     even now watches. Invoked by them, her spirit is frequently\r\n     encountered in its twilight flights on errands of mercy and\r\n     consolation, issuing from the ancient groves of Chapultepec,\r\n     where centres the recollection of Aztec glories. Ballads\r\n     still perpetuate her virtues, and many a nature’s monument\r\n     bears proudly the beloved name of Malintzin. Tradition also\r\n     transforms her into a naiad who daily rises from the pool\r\n     of Chapultepec, singing divinely. _Rodriguez_, _Anáhuac_,\r\n     461. She appears to have had several children by Cortés.\r\n     Peralta mentions five besides Martin, of whom two died\r\n     while young. The three remaining were daughters, of whom\r\n     two became nuns, and the third, Leonor, the wife of Martin\r\n     de Tolosa. _Nat. Hist._, 75. This is not wholly correct,\r\n     however, for in the Libro de Gobierno del Virey Mendoza is\r\n     a document, dated April, 1550, wherein the viceroy grants\r\n     a petition from her in favor of her grandson, Don Alonso de\r\n     Estrada, son of Luis de Saavedra, deceased, and encomendero\r\n     of Tilantongo town. Alaman’s notes, in _Prescott’s Mex._\r\n     (Mex. 1844), ii. 268-9. In _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. 123,\r\n     ii. 70, 101, witnesses refer also to a daughter of the\r\n     interpreter Marina, with whom Cortés is accused of having\r\n     tampered, as he did with the mother. If so, this can hardly\r\n     be Saavedra’s wife, but a Tabascan child; yet Marina’s\r\n     master would not have presented a woman incumbered with a\r\n     child when he sought to do honor to the Spaniards. Saavedra\r\n     allows Marina to proceed to Spain with her husband, who\r\n     procured for her a high position at court. Here she died,\r\n     leaving several children, from whom descended some of the\r\n     first families in Spain. _Dic. Univ._, ix. 778. But this\r\n     authority is too full of blunders to be relied upon. Ideal\r\n     portraits are given in _Carbajal Espinosa_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     ii. 65, and _Zamacois_, _Hist. Méj._, ii. 350.\r\n\r\n     [155] I have said, as the native record interpreted by\r\n     Tezozomoc and Duran relates, that the fleet is sighted\r\n     and reported long before it reaches San Juan de Ulua—from\r\n     Tabasco, says Vetancvrt, _Teatro Mex._, ii. 114. Montezuma,\r\n     who had already begun to hope that the strangers would never\r\n     return, becomes sad with apprehension; yet he orders special\r\n     relays to be stationed on the route to the coast, in order\r\n     to bring speedy news, commands his lieutenant to furnish the\r\n     strangers with all they need, and sends Tlillancalqui, the\r\n     messenger who met Grijalva, to ascertain their object. He\r\n     is instructed to declare that Montezuma holds the throne as\r\n     mere deputy at the disposal of the white god, for he supposes\r\n     that it is Quetzalcoatl, as before. If the god intends to\r\n     proceed to Mexico the roads will be cleaned, and the towns\r\n     and stations prepared for his accommodation. Tlillancalqui\r\n     delivers his message, together with a necklace of gold set\r\n     with precious stones, and in his eagerness to please the\r\n     strange beings he offers fowl and tortilla to horses as\r\n     well as men. Cortés signifies his wish to go to Mexico,\r\n     and asks that chiefs be sent to guide him. Tlillancalqui\r\n     hurries back with the message, leaving orders to supply the\r\n     Spaniards with all they desire. _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._, MS.,\r\n     ii. 389-96; _Tezozomoc_, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 250-3. According\r\n     to the version by Sahagun and Torquemada, Montezuma sends\r\n     the same messengers whom he despatched the year before to\r\n     seek Grijalva, but who arrived too late. Their names are\r\n     Yohualychan, the leader, Tepuztecatl, Tizahua, Huehuetecatl,\r\n     and Hueycamecatleca. With them are sent the presents\r\n     already prepared for Grijalva, and the sacerdotal vestments\r\n     of Quetzalcoatl. On reaching the flag-ship they inquire\r\n     for their king and god Quetzalcoatl. At first surprised,\r\n     Cortés the next moment catches the clue. Seating himself\r\n     on an improvised throne, surrounded by a large suite, he\r\n     orders the messengers to appear. Being told that he is the\r\n     personage whom they seek, they prostrate themselves, kissing\r\n     the deck. The leader thereupon addresses him: ‘Welcome,\r\n     god and master; long have we, your servants and vassals,\r\n     waited for you. Montezuma, your vassal and lieutenant, sends\r\n     us to salute you, and begs the acceptance of this small\r\n     present and these precious ornaments, once used by you as\r\n     our king and god.’ They now array him in the vestments of\r\n     Quetzalcoatl, adding also many ornaments pertaining to the\r\n     gods Tezcatlipoca and Tlalocatecuhtli, as if to proclaim him\r\n     the greatest of the gods. The most attractive pieces are a\r\n     bejewelled and plume head-dress, and a necklace of precious\r\n     stones. ‘Is this all the gift of welcome that you bring?’\r\n     asks Cortés. ‘Lord and king, it is all that was given us\r\n     for your Majesty,’ was the reply. They are given food and\r\n     accommodation for the night. In order to impress upon them\r\n     the full extent of Spanish power, they are tied hands and\r\n     feet while the horses are exhibited, the arms displayed, and\r\n     the guns fired. They are then told that the white men have\r\n     heard the fame of Mexican warriors, as able to overcome ten\r\n     or even twenty times superior numbers, and desire a proof\r\n     thereof by fighting them in equal force. Swords and shields\r\n     are given them, but they decline, pleading their character\r\n     as mere envoys. They are thereupon insulted as cowards, and\r\n     told that the white men will descend upon their country,\r\n     kill all who resist, take possession of the government, and\r\n     secure better presents than those sent them. The messengers\r\n     now hurry back to Mexico without informing any one on the\r\n     way of what has occurred. _Torquemada_, i. 381-4; _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist.

But the scholar is too severe upon the soldier,\r\n     whose head is true enough, however may be his tongue.\r\n\r\n     [159] ‘All Gomara’s fictions,’ sneers Las Casas, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, iv. 484, who ignores Marina’s ability to interpret,\r\n     and thinks the interview was limited to the simplest\r\n     expressions conveyed by signs.\r\n\r\n     [160] _Carta del Ayunt._, ubi sup., 19. Gomara, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 39-41, while he does not refer to a helmet, states\r\n     that Cortés asked for gold, as a remedy for heart disease,\r\n     from which he and his men were suffering.\r\n\r\n     [161] ‘Dexo alli dos hombres principales, como capitanes,\r\n     con hasta dos mil personas entre mugeres y hombres de\r\n     servicio, y fuese a Cotosta.’ _Gomara_, _Hist.

Verdad._, 26.\r\n     This statement is followed by a cut at Gomara for giving\r\n     unreliable information. _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlasc._, 141.\r\n     The native version of Sahagun and Torquemada describes how\r\n     the messengers are sprinkled with fresh human blood, as\r\n     customary with important bearers of news, before presenting\r\n     themselves before Montezuma. They arouse his admiration by\r\n     speaking of the wonders beheld, of the penetrating swords,\r\n     the sulphurous smell of the thunder smoke, and of the\r\n     intoxicating food; but when they relate how outrageously\r\n     they have been treated and how the strangers threatened\r\n     to conquer the country, then the emperor wept, and with\r\n     him all the city. _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, i. 12-13;\r\n     _Torquemada_, i. 385-6; _Acosta_, _Hist. Ind._, 515-18.\r\n     Brasseur de Bourbourg incorporates all this native version\r\n     in his narrative, and allows Teuhtlile to reach Mexico\r\n     with his report a few days after these messengers, thus\r\n     confirming their account. _Hist. Nat.

The color of his command was not\r\nsufficiently pronounced. He had no authority to settle; he had no\r\nauthority to conquer; he might only discover and trade. He did not\r\ncare for Velazquez; anything that pertained to Velazquez he was\r\nprepared to take. But Velazquez had no legal power to authorize him\r\nfurther. Cortés cared little for the authorities at Española; the\r\nking was his chief dependence; the king to whose favor his right\r\narm and mother wit should pave the way. Some signal service, in the\r\neyes of the monarch, might atone for slight irregularities; if he\r\nfailed, the severest punishments were already come. But where was\r\nthe service? Had Montezuma granted him an interview, he might make\r\nreport of that, and find listeners. As it was, he could land and slay\r\na few thousand natives, but his men would waste away and no benefits\r\naccrue. Nevertheless, if he could plant himself somewhat more firmly\r\non this soil than his commission seemed to justify, chance might offer\r\nopportunity, and the signal service find achievement. Such were the\r\nthoughts that just now filled his sagacious brain, but the way was\r\nby no means clear before him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the events narrated in the preceding chapter were in progress,\r\nMontejo, with two vessels, had been sent northward to seek a harbor\r\nless unwholesome than the present, where many of those wounded at\r\nTabasco had died.[176] As second in command went Rodrigo Álvarez\r\nChico, and as pilots, Alaminos, and Álvarez el Manquillo. On reaching\r\nthe extreme point attained by Grijalva, the strong current prevented\r\nfurther advance, as in the former attempt.[177] They were obliged by\r\na gale to throw overboard part of their cargo. Water failed, and in\r\nthe attempt to land an artilleryman perished. Prayer was now their\r\nonly recourse, and this not only changed the wind, but brought rain.\r\nAfter a fortnight of misadventures[178] they returned to San Juan\r\nde Ulua, and hastened bareheaded to the cross to offer thanks. More\r\nwholesome airs were not difficult to find, but good harbors were not\r\nabundant thereabout. The only favorable spot found by Montejo lay\r\nsome ten leagues north of the camp, close to the native fortress of\r\nQuiahuiztlan.[179] A high rock affording shelter from north winds\r\ngave the place some resemblance to the Spanish harbor of Bernal,\r\nwhich name was accordingly applied to it. Extending inland were green\r\nfields fringed with fine timber, and supplied with creeks of good\r\nwater.[180]\r\n\r\nThe fifty men comprising the expedition of Montejo had been picked\r\nfrom the adherents of Velazquez, in order that by weakening this\r\nfaction Cortés might be allowed to develop his plans. For the army was\r\nslowly but surely drifting into division, as we have so often found\r\nin adventures of this kind, and the Velazquez party comprised all who\r\ndesired immediately to return. In this clique were many wealthy and\r\ninfluential men who cared no more for Velazquez than for Cortés, but\r\nwho had possessions in Cuba, and were becoming impatient to return\r\nto them. Nor was there much difficulty in giving form to discontent.\r\nThere were grave suspicions afloat as to the loyalty of the commander;\r\nbut these, which assuredly were more conspicuous in Cuba than here,\r\nwere of little moment when they harmonized with the wishes of the\r\nmen. What stupidity in forming camp amidst such malaria, and in so\r\nearly making enemies of the people. It was evident, so they argued,\r\nthat the commander intended to sacrifice the company to his ambition.\r\n\r\nThe action of Cortés here as elsewhere marks the great man, the man\r\nof genius, the born master of men, and rightfully places him beside\r\nthe Cæsars and the Napoleons of the world. The commander wished to\r\nremain. All his fortune, all the fortunes of his friends were staked\r\non this adventure, and he would rather die than return unsuccessful.\r\nLittle hope there would be of his obtaining command again; he would\r\nnot return, neither would he just at present die. In desperate cases\r\nspirited counsels and spirited actions are usually safest.\r\n\r\nCalling to him his most trusty followers, Puertocarrero, Alvarado\r\nand his brothers, Ávila, Olid, Escalante, and Francisco Lugo, he\r\nlaid the situation fairly before them. Shortly after these captains\r\nwere out among the men, holding forth to them privately on the wealth\r\nof the country, the ease and glory of conquest, and the prospect of\r\nrepartimientos. Where was the benefit of returning to Cuba? Surely\r\nthey might as well hold the country for themselves as to abandon it\r\nand let others step into their places. It would be much easier to\r\nincrease the present force by adding to it than to raise a new army\r\nbetter appointed or larger than this. Nor did they forget the argument\r\nof religion, which, however hollow in practice, was weighty enough in\r\ntheory. “Elect therefore to remain,” they said in conclusion; “and\r\nchoose the able and generous Cortés for your general and justicia\r\nmayor till the emperor decides in the matter.”[181]\r\n\r\nThe opposition was by no means ignorant of these manœuvres, and Ordaz\r\nwas commissioned to remonstrate with Cortés. He dwelt on the danger\r\nof present colonization, denounced any attempt to ignore Velazquez,\r\nand insisted on instant return. Suppressing the anger naturally\r\narising from these insinuations, true as they were, Cortés disavowed\r\nany intention of exceeding the instructions of his commission. For\r\nhimself he preferred to remain, as, among other reasons, the only\r\nmeans of reimbursing himself for his heavy expenditures. If, however,\r\nit was the will of the army to return, he would yield. A few hours\r\nlater appeared an order to embark the following day for Cuba. This,\r\nas was intended, brought public feeling to a crisis. All saw their\r\ngolden hopes suddenly dashed to the ground, their visions of honors and\r\nrepartimientos dispelled; even the men so lately clamorous to return\r\nwere not prepared to find their request so readily granted. Would it\r\nnot be well to think further of the matter, and perhaps devise a plan\r\nto cover the emergency? After noisy discussion the soldiers appeared\r\nin force before the captain-general and demanded the revocation of\r\nthe order. They had left Cuba with the declared understanding that a\r\ncolony was to be planted, and now they were informed that Velazquez\r\nhad given no authority to settle. And if he had not, were not the\r\ninterests of God and the king paramount to the order of any governor?\r\nAnd did not this same Velazquez defame Grijalva for not disobeying\r\ninstructions in this very regard? With no small satisfaction Cortés\r\nsaw that he was safe; then urging calm deliberation he graciously\r\npromised delay,[182] which was employed first of all in impressing\r\non their minds how indispensable he was to their success.\r\n\r\nFinally before the assembled army the captain-general appeared and\r\nsaid: That he had invested his whole fortune in the fleet, and\r\ncontrolled it; yet he was willing to subordinate his individual\r\ninterest to that of the whole. He had given the order to return\r\nbecause he understood such to be the will of the majority. As this\r\nwas not the case, he would gladly remain; for God who had ever been\r\nwith them was now disclosing such a field of wealth and glory as had\r\nnever before been offered to Spaniard. Yet, if any wished to return,\r\nlet them freely speak, and a vessel would be at their disposal. What\r\nmagic power ruled, that, when the disaffected majority were thus\r\ngiven their way, every mouth was dumb, and the commander remained\r\nmore potent than ever?\r\n\r\nA colony being thus decided on, the founding ceremony was performed\r\nby the quasi laying out of a town, the planting a pillory in the\r\nplaza, and a gallows at some distance outside,[183] though strictly\r\nspeaking, the town was not properly located or laid out till afterward.\r\nReferring to the treasures here obtained, and to the day of landing,\r\nthe new town was called Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz.[184] Cortés, as\r\ncommander, appointed the municipal officers,[185] naming for alcaldes\r\nPuertocarrero and Montejo, a judicious selection, both for his own\r\ninterests and as likely to meet general approval. And here again is\r\ndisplayed the subtle policy of Cortés, who to this important position\r\nnominates but one from among his own faction, Montejo being for\r\nVelazquez. Thus of an opponent he made an adherent, conciliating at\r\nthe same time the entire Velazquez party.[186] The regidores were\r\nAlonso de Ávila, Pedro and Alonso de Alvarado, and Gonzalo de Sandoval;\r\nprocurador general, Francisco Álvarez Chico; alguacil mayor, Juan de\r\nEscalante; escribano, Diego de Godoy. Beside these were appointed,\r\nin the interests of the military department, as capitan de entradas\r\nPedro de Alvarado; maestre de campo, Cristóbal de Olid; alférez,\r\nCorral; alguaciles de real, Ochoa and Romero; tesorero, Gonzalo Mejía;\r\ncontador, Alonso de Ávila.[187] Nearly all these men were devoted to\r\nCortés, and were therefore a powerful _point d’appui_ for his project.\r\n\r\nThus far all was well. The men of Velazquez and the men of Cortés,\r\nSpaniards all, for the same God and the same king, had of their own\r\nvolition determined here to plant a Spanish settlement, and had so\r\nplanted it. By virtue of his office, and in the absence of any higher\r\nauthority, the captain-general had chosen temporary officers for the\r\nnew commonwealth. This was all. These men had elected to transform\r\nthe army into a civil society, for temporary or permanent purposes\r\nas the case might be; and they had done so. But about their leader?\r\nWhat position did he occupy? A general without an army, _de facto_\r\nat the head of affairs, but by no legal right. Let him cut his own\r\nknot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHat in hand, before the new municipality, Cortés appeared and\r\nsurrendered his commission. Authority, chief and absolute, was now\r\nvested alone in the ayuntamiento. Then with the modesty of Cincinnatus\r\nhe retired.\r\n\r\nIt was then in order, on the part of the municipality, to choose a\r\nchief ruler and representative of royal authority. This could be done\r\nby the council alone, though in this instance, for obvious reasons,\r\nit would be better to secure the appointment by popular vote. Cortés\r\nfelt safe enough either way. A glowing eulogy delivered by a fluent\r\nspeaker was followed by such noisy demonstrations that the opposition\r\nfound no opportunity to express their opinion.[188] The following day\r\na committee was sent to apprise Cortés of his election,[189] in the\r\nname of their Catholic Highnesses, to the offices of captain-general,\r\nand of justicia mayor of the town. On appearing before the council to\r\ntake the oath, the alcalde addressed Cortés, giving as reason for the\r\nappointment his loyalty, his worth, and his talents. The commission\r\nwhich was then given granted him one fifth of all treasure acquired\r\nby trade or conquest, after deducting the royal fifth. This was in\r\nconsideration chiefly for his services as leader.[190] _Exitus acta\r\nprobat._ Las Casas insists that, since Cortés had no authority to\r\nform a settlement, his appointment of an ayuntamiento was illegal,\r\nand consequently their election of him. No one supposed for a moment,\r\nleast of all Cortés, that these proceedings were regular. They were\r\nbut make-believe legal. But in following Gomara’s version Las Casas\r\nfailed to understand that the appointment was conferred by the popular\r\nmajority in the name of the king, which though not strictly legal\r\nthrew over all the color of law. Beside, with consummate skill Cortés\r\nmade it appear that the expedition obliged him to act as he did;\r\nand if these manœuvres did not legalize the transaction, they were\r\nthe means of weaving a strong bond between the men and their leader,\r\nsuch as King Charles and all his ordinance-makers never could have\r\ncreated. Cortés was no longer the chief of Velazquez’ expedition,\r\nbut the leader of the Vera Cruz militia, as the army might now be\r\ntermed, and removable only by the power that placed him there, or by\r\nthe emperor.[191]\r\n\r\nAlthough opposition was now in vain, the adherents of Velazquez loudly\r\ndenounced the whole affair, called it a conspiracy and a cheat, and\r\nrefused to acknowledge Cortés as their leader. So abusive did they\r\nbecome that open rupture was imminent. The leaders of this faction\r\nwere Velazquez de Leon, Ordaz, Escobar, Pedro Escudero, Morla, and\r\nthe priest Juan Diaz. Seeing the necessity of prompt action, Cortés\r\nseized the first two, with a few others, and sent them on shipboard\r\nin irons, while Alvarado went a-foraging with a hundred men, chiefly\r\nadherents of the disaffected leaders.[192] They found a fertile\r\ncountry, and several small towns. The inhabitants fled at their\r\napproach, leaving signs of recent human sacrifices in the temple. In\r\none building, with pyramidal foundation several feet in height, were\r\nfound a number of fine rooms, some filled with grain, beans, honey,\r\nand other provisions; others with cotton fabrics and feathers, adorned\r\nin instances with gold and silver. In obedience to strict orders\r\nnothing was touched save food. The report brought back of the beauty\r\nof the country, together with the ample supplies obtained, tended\r\ntoward harmony; and while the soldiers were thus easily reconciled to\r\nthe new order of things, Cortés with his usual tact won over nearly\r\nall his adversaries. Some he bribed, some he flattered; others were\r\nallured with hopes of preferment. Most remarkable was it that with such\r\nfire in his veins, he could so control it; for however treacherous\r\nCortés knew them to be, seldom a sign escaped him that he suspected\r\nthem. Even the imprisoned officers yielded to his persuasive power,\r\naided as it was by irons, and soon were ranked among his devoted\r\nsustainers.[193]\r\n\r\nAnd now came to pass an event such as the gods not unfrequently fling\r\ntheir favorites, which was materially to brighten the prospects of the\r\nSpaniards. While preparing their removal to a new harbor, and shortly\r\nafter the Mexican withdrawal from intercourse, Bernal Diaz brought\r\nin from his outpost five Indians, different in dress and features\r\nfrom any hitherto seen. Among other peculiarities were large gold\r\nrings, set with stones, in their perforated ears, nose, and lower\r\nlip. Two of them, who spoke Mexican, explained the purport of their\r\nvisit. The deeds of the Spaniards having reached the ears of their\r\nmaster, the lord of Cempoala, in the Totonac country, they had been\r\nsent to see these valiant beings, and invite them to their city a few\r\nleagues distant.[194] Questionings revealed that the Totonacs were a\r\nsubjected nation, languishing like others under the oppressive yoke\r\nof the Aztecs, and only too ready to welcome deliverance.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Cortés and his companions were wholly in\r\nthe dark as to the power and positions of the interior nations. Now\r\nfor the first time a little light was shed on the subject. It appeared\r\nthat the mighty monarch, with whom took place the late interchange of\r\ncourtesies, had enemies who, if not as powerful as himself, were still\r\nstrong, and in spirit, at least, unsubdued. Might not this adverse\r\ninfluence be utilized and joined to other adverse influences for the\r\nhumbling of the great interior power? Possibly Montezuma might grant\r\nCortés audience under circumstances yet to be. Thus the plan of the\r\nconquest was conceived. The messengers were dismissed with presents\r\nand the assurance of a speedy visit.[195]\r\n\r\nAccording to Ixtlilxochitl, the first revelation of Aztec weakness\r\nwas made by his ancestor and namesake, the king of northern\r\nAcolhuacan.[196] Fearing the power and treachery of Montezuma and his\r\nallies, and hating the Aztecs with a perfect hatred, this prince had\r\nhailed with joy the arrival of the Spaniards, and had gloated over\r\nthe terror with which their presence would inspire the emperor. The\r\nprospect of gaining an ally who might aid his own ambitious plans\r\nfor supremacy, and for Mexican humiliation, impelled him to send an\r\nembassy to Cortés with rich presents, and with instructions to explain\r\nto the strangers the prevailing disaffection, the ease with which\r\nthe Aztecs might be overthrown, and the rare spoils that would accrue\r\nto the conquerors. The interview with Cortés is placed at about the\r\nsame time as the Totonac visit, and Ixtlilxochitl is said to have\r\nreceived the most friendly assurances from Cortés.[197] Be that as\r\nit may, here was an incident which should crush all cavillings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs well to examine the country as to inure the troops to whatever\r\nexperience should be theirs on this strange shore, Cortés with about\r\nfour hundred men and two light guns proceeded by land to Cempoala,\r\nwhile the fleet with the heavy camp material and the remainder of\r\nthe expedition coasted farther northward to Quiahuiztlan.\r\n\r\nBurning overhead was the sun; burning underfoot were the sands;\r\nwhile on the one side was the tantalizing sea, and on the other\r\nthe tantalizing wood, both inviting by their cool refreshing airs.\r\nBehind the dark-fringed forests rose old Orizaba,[198] laughing at\r\ntheir distress beneath its cap of snow, and wondering why mortals so\r\nsuperior should choose the deadly _tierra caliente_ country for their\r\npromenade, when gentle, genial Anáhuac lay so near. But presently\r\nthe senses quickened to the aroma of vegetation; soft swards and\r\ncultivated fields spread before them their living green, and the moist,\r\nmurmuring wood anon threw over them its grateful shade. If beside\r\ngrave thoughts on the stupendous matters then under consideration,\r\nmight find place such trifles of God’s creation as birds of brilliant\r\nplumage and of sweet song, they were there in myriads to charm the\r\neye and ear; game to fill the stomach, though not so satisfying as\r\ngold, always commanded attention, and was also plentiful.[199] Through\r\nall, dispensing life and beauty on every side, flowed the Rio de la\r\nAntigua, where a few years later rose old Vera Cruz.[200]\r\n\r\nCrossing this stream with the aid of rafts and shaky canoes, the army\r\nquartered on the opposite bank, in one of the towns there, which was\r\ndestitute alike of food and people, but which displayed the usual\r\nghastly indications of recent human sacrifice. The next morning they\r\nfollowed the river westward, and soon after met a party of twelve\r\nTotonacs, who had been sent by the Cempoalan ruler with presents of\r\nfood. By them the Spaniards were guided northward to a hamlet where a\r\nbountiful supper was provided.[201] While marching the next day, with\r\nscouts deployed as usual to guard against ambuscades, they emerged\r\nfrom a dense tropical forest into the midst of gardens and orchards,\r\nand by a sudden turn in the road the bright buildings of Cempoala\r\nstood forth to view.\r\n\r\nJust then twenty nobles appeared and offered welcome. They were\r\nfollowed by slaves, and instantly the travel-worn army was revelling\r\nin fruits and flowers. What more beautiful reception could have been\r\ngiven? yet the Spaniards would have preferred a shower of gold. To\r\nCortés were given bouquets; a garland, chiefly of roses, was flung\r\naround his neck, and a wreath placed upon his helmet. Species of\r\npineapples and cherries, juicy zapotes, and aromatic anones were\r\ndistributed to the men without stint. Almost the entire populace of\r\nthe city, some twenty-five thousand,[202] staring their wonderment\r\nwith open eyes and mouth, thronged either side of the way along which\r\nmarched the army in battle array, headed by the cavalry. Never before\r\nhad the Spaniards seen so beautiful an American city. Cortés called it\r\nSeville, a name which Spaniards frequently applied to any place that\r\npleased them, as we have seen, while the soldiers, charmed with its\r\nfloral wealth and beauty, termed it Villaviciosa, and declared it a\r\nterrestrial paradise. One of the cavalry scouts, on first beholding\r\nthe freshly stuccoed walls gleaming in the sun, came galloping back\r\nwith the intelligence that the houses were silver-plated. It was indeed\r\nan important place, holding a large daily market. A central plaza\r\nwas inclosed by imposing temples and palaces, resting on pyramidal\r\nfoundations, lined with apartments and surmounted by towers, and\r\naround clustered neat dwellings with whitened adobe walls embowered\r\nin foliage. Statelier edifices of masonry, some having several\r\ncourt-yards, rose here and there, while in every direction spread\r\nan extensive suburb of mud huts with the never failing palm-leaf\r\nroof. Yet even the humblest abodes were smothered in flowers.[203]\r\nThe people also, as we might expect by their surroundings, were of a\r\nsuperior order, well formed, of intelligent aspect, clothed in neat\r\nwhite and colored cotton robes and mantles, the nobles being adorned\r\nwith golden necklaces, bracelets, and nose and lip rings, set with\r\npearls and precious stones.\r\n\r\nWhen the troops reached the plaza, Chicomacatl,[204] lord of the\r\nprovince, stepped from the palace to receive his guests. He was\r\nsupported by two nobles, and though enormously stout,[205] his features\r\ndenoted high intelligence, and his manner refinement. He was more\r\nof a gentleman than many of the Spaniards, whose merriment over his\r\ncorpulence Cortés was obliged to repress. After saluting and wafting\r\nincense before the commander of the strange company, Chicomacatl\r\nembraced Cortés and led him to his quarters in the spacious halls\r\nadjoining the temple, after which he retired for a time. There the\r\nmen rested and refreshed themselves, guards being carefully posted,\r\nfor Cortés would not trust his fate to strangers, and strict orders\r\nwere given that no one should leave the building.[206]\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Chicomacatl returned in a litter with a richly\r\nattired suite, bringing presents of fine robes, and jewels worth\r\nabout two thousand ducats. During the conversation that ensued,\r\nCortés as usual extolled the greatness and power of his king, and\r\nspoke warmly of his mission to replace their bloody religion with\r\na knowledge of the true God. Were there wrongs to redress, that is\r\nto say, when opportunity offered for the perpetration of a greater\r\nwrong by himself, no knight of La Mancha or Amadis of Gaul could\r\nbe more valiant than he. In return the chief of Cempoala unbosomed\r\nhimself, for the manner of Cortés was winning, and his speech inspired\r\nconfidence whenever he chose to make it so. Then his fame, already\r\nwide-spread over the land, and the dim uncertainty as to his nature,\r\nwhether more celestial or terrestrial, added weight to his words.\r\nSo Chicomacatl poured forth from an overflowing heart a torrent of\r\ncomplaints against the tyranny of Montezuma. He drew for the Spaniards\r\na historic outline of the Aztecs—how a people the youngest in the\r\nland had, at first by cunning and treachery, and finally by forced\r\nallies and preponderance of arms, built their power upon the ruin of\r\nolder states. The Totonacs, whose records as an independent nation in\r\nthis region extended over seven centuries, had succumbed only some\r\ntwenty-five years before this.[207] And now Montezuma’s collectors\r\noverran the provinces, gathering heavy tributes, seizing the beautiful\r\nmaidens, and conveying the men into slavery or to the sacrificial\r\nstone. Neither life, liberty, nor property could be enjoyed with any\r\ndegree of safety.\r\n\r\nWhereat Cortés of course was indignant. It was his special business\r\nto do all the tyrannizing in that region himself; his sword would\r\ngive ample protection to his new allies, and bring abundant honor\r\nto his king and himself. Let but the people prove loyal to him, he\r\nconcluded, and he surely would deliver them from the hated yoke;\r\nyet he did not mention the more fatal bondage into which he would\r\nplace them. Chicomacatl eagerly assured Cortés of support from the\r\nTotonacs, numbering fifty thousand warriors, with numerous towns and\r\nfortresses.[208] Furthermore, there were many other states ready to\r\njoin an insurrection which should prove strong enough to brave the\r\nterrible Montezuma.\r\n\r\nTheir visit over,[209] the Spaniards continued their march northward\r\nto join the fleet. Four hundred _tlamamas_, or carriers, attended, in\r\ncourtesy to honored guests, to relieve the soldiers of their burdens.\r\nThe following day they reached Quiahuiztlan, a fortified town about\r\na league from the sea. This town was picturesquely placed on a rocky\r\npromontory bordering one of the many wild ravines thereabout, and of\r\ndifficult access, commanding the plain and harbor at its base.[210]\r\nThe army advanced cautiously, in battle array,[211] but the place\r\nwas deserted. On reaching the plaza, however, some fifteen chiefs\r\ncame forward with swinging censers, and apologized, saying that the\r\npeople had fled, not knowing what the strange arrival portended, but\r\nreassured by the Cempoalans, they were already returning to serve\r\nthem. The soldiers then took possession of a large building, where\r\nfood was brought them. Presently the chief appeared; and close at his\r\nheels in hot haste came the lord of Cempoala, who announced that the\r\nAztec collectors had entered his city.[212] While conferring with\r\nCortés and the chiefs assembled, Chicomacatl was informed that the\r\ncollectors, five[213] in number, had followed him to Quiahuiztlan, and\r\nwere even then at the door. All the chiefs present turned pale, and\r\nhastened out to humble themselves before the officers, who responded\r\nwith disdainful condescension. The officers were clad in embroidered\r\nrobes, with a profusion of jewelry, and wore the hair gathered upon\r\nthe crown. In the right hand they carried their insignia of office, a\r\nhooked carved stick, and in the left a bunch of roses, the ever welcome\r\noffering of the obsequious Totonac nobles who swelled their train.\r\nA suite of servitors followed, some with fans and dusters, for the\r\ncomfort of their masters. Passing the Spanish quarter without deigning\r\nto salute the strangers, the emissaries of the mighty Montezuma\r\nentered another large building, and after refreshing themselves\r\nsummoned the tributary chiefs, reprimanded them for having received\r\nthe Spaniards without permission from Montezuma, and demanded twenty\r\nyoung persons for an atoning sacrifice. Well might the demoniacal\r\norder cause to tremble every youth throughout the land; for whose\r\nturn should be next none could tell. Even the faces of the chiefs\r\nwere blanched as they told Cortés, informing him also that it was\r\nalready determined in Aztec circles to make slaves of the Spaniards,\r\nand after being used awhile for purposes of procreation, they were\r\nto be sacrificed.[214] Cortés laughed, and ordered the Totonacs to\r\nseize the insolent officials. What! lay violent hands on Montezuma’s\r\nmessengers? The very thought to them was appalling. Nevertheless they\r\ndid it, for there was something in the tone of Cortés that made them\r\nobey, though they could not distinguish the meaning of his words.\r\nThey laid hold on those tax-men of Montezuma, put collars on their\r\nnecks, and tied their hands and feet to poles.[215] Their timidity\r\nthus broken, they became audacious, and demanded the sacrifice of the\r\nprisoners.[216] “By no means,” Cortés said, and he himself assumed\r\ntheir custody.\r\n\r\nHowsoever the cards fall to him, a skilful gamester plays each\r\nseverally, nothing cavilling, at its worth. So Cortés now played\r\nthese messengers, the method assuming form in his mind immediately he\r\nsaw them. With him this whole Mexican business was one great game,\r\na life game, though it should last but a day; and as the agencies\r\nand influences of it fell into his fingers, with the subtlety of the\r\nserpent he dealt them out, placing one here and another there, playing\r\nwith equal readiness enemy against enemy, and multiplying friends by\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThese so lately pride-puffed tribute-men, now low laid in the depths\r\nof despondency—how shall they be played? Well, let them be like him\r\nwho fell amongst thieves, while the Spanish commander acts the good\r\nSamaritan. In pursuance of which plan, when all had retired for the\r\nnight, he went stealthily to them, asked who they were, and why they\r\nwere in that sad plight, pretending ignorance. And when they told\r\nhim, this rare redresser was angry, hot with indignation that the\r\nnoble representatives of so noble a monarch should be so treated.\r\nWhereupon he instantly released two of them, comforting the others\r\nwith the assurance that their deliverance should quickly follow; for\r\nthe emperor Montezuma he esteemed above all emperors, and he desired\r\nto serve him, as commanded by his king. Then he sent the twain down\r\nthe coast in a boat, beyond the Totonac boundary.\r\n\r\nNext morning, when told that two of the Aztec captives had broken\r\ntheir bonds and escaped, the Totonacs were more urgent than ever for\r\nthe immolation of the others. But Cortés again said no, and arranged\r\nthat they should be sent in chains on board one of his vessels,\r\ndetermined afterward to release them, for they were worth far more\r\nto his purpose alive than dead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing at this juncture to hear pious people censure Cortés\r\nfor his duplicity, and to hear other pious people defend him on the\r\nground of necessity, or otherwise. Such men might with equal reason\r\nwrangle over the method by which it was right and honorable for the\r\ntiger to spring and seize the hind. The one great wrong is lost sight\r\nof in the discussion of numerous lesser wrongs. The murderer of an\r\nempire should not be too severely criticised for crushing a gnat\r\nwhile on the way about the business.[217]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of Cortés, messengers were sent to all the towns of\r\nthe province, with orders to stop the payment of tribute and to seize\r\nthe collectors, but to spare their lives. Information was likewise\r\nto be given to the neighboring nations, that all might prepare to\r\nresist the force which Montezuma would probably send against them. The\r\nTotonacs became wild with joy, and declared that the little band who\r\ndare so brave Montezuma must be more than men.[218] To Quiahuitzlan\r\nflocked chiefs and nobles from all parts, eager to behold these beings,\r\nand to ascertain their own future course of action. There were those\r\namong them still timid, who urged an embassy to the king of kings,\r\nto beseech pardon before his army should be upon them, slaying,\r\nenslaving, and laying waste; but Cortés had already influence, was\r\nalready strong enough to allay their fears, and bring them all into\r\nallegiance to the Spanish sovereign, exacting their oath before the\r\nnotary Godoy to support him with all their forces. Thus, by virtue\r\nof this man’s mind, many battles were fought and won without the\r\nstriking of a blow. Already every Spaniard there was a sovereign,\r\nand the meanest soldier among them a ruler of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [176] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 27. Herrera, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. v. cap. vi., and others refer to a similar number\r\n     as being on the sick-list. Yellow fever, or vómito negro,\r\n     now the scourge of this and adjoining regions, appears to\r\n     have developed with the growth of European settlements, and\r\n     Clavigero states that it was not known there before 1725.\r\n     _Storia Mess._, i. 117.\r\n\r\n     [177] ‘Hasta el parage del rio grande de Pánuco,’ _Herrera_,\r\n     loc. cit. ‘Llegaron al parage del rio grande, que es cerca\r\n     de Panuco, adonde otra vez llegamos quãdo lo del Capitá\r\n     Juan de Grijalua.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.

Chich._, 289. Quiauitl, rain\r\n     or shower. _Molina_, _Vocabulario_. Hence rainy place.\r\n     Herrera calls it Chianhuitzlan, and this has been adopted\r\n     by Clavigero and most other writers. Prescott, _Mex._, i.\r\n     348, in a note holds up Clavigero as a standard for the\r\n     spelling of Mexican names, but he forgets that the Italian\r\n     form, as in the above case, would be misleading to English\r\n     people.\r\n\r\n     [180] ‘Le llamarõ Vernal, por ser, como es, vn Cerro alto.’\r\n     _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 115. This may have\r\n     been the origin of the name for the Spanish port, after\r\n     which Bernal Diaz says it was called. _Hist. Verdad._, 27.\r\n     He applies the name to a neighboring fort, spelling it in\r\n     different ways, of which Solis, and consequently Robertson,\r\n     have selected the most unlikely. Gomara applies Aquiahuiztlan\r\n     to the harbor. _Hist. Mex._, 49.\r\n\r\n     [181] Bernal Diaz relates with great satisfaction how\r\n     earnestly the speaker pleaded for his vote, addressing\r\n     him repeatedly as ‘your worship.’ One reason for their\r\n     earnestness, he implies, was the superiority in number\r\n     of the Velazquez party. ‘Los deudos, y amigos del Diego\r\n     Velazquez, que eran muchos mas que nosotros.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 28-9. He forms this estimate most likely\r\n     on the proportion of leaders who from jealousy of Cortés,\r\n     and for other reasons, were addicted to Velazquez; but\r\n     their men were probably more in favor of the general than\r\n     of the captains, to judge from the result. The sailors for\r\n     obvious reasons may have added to the Velazquez number, if\r\n     not to their strength.\r\n\r\n     [182] ‘Se hazia mucho de rogar: y como dize el refran: Tu\r\n     me lo ruegas, è yo me lo quiero.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 29.\r\n\r\n     [183] ‘Se puso vna picota en la plaça, y fuera de la Uilla\r\n     vna horca.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 29; _Vetancvrt_,\r\n     _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 116. This signifies that justice\r\n     was installed, its officers being next appointed.\r\n\r\n     [184] See note 23, chap. ii., this volume.\r\n\r\n     [185] ‘Nombrónos ... por alcaldes y regidores,’ say\r\n     distinctly the appointed officers themselves, in their\r\n     letter to the emperor. _Carta del Ayunt._, in _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 20. Bernal Diaz also indicates that Cortés made the\r\n     appointments, although he at first says, ‘hizimos Alcalde,\r\n     y Regidores.’ Yet it is probable that the authorities were\r\n     confirmed formally as they were tacitly by the members of\r\n     the expedition; for Cortés, as he acknowledges, had no real\r\n     authority to form a settlement.\r\n\r\n     [186] _Testimonio de Montejo_, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i.\r\n     489. ‘Â este Montejo porque no estaua muy bien con Cortés,\r\n     por metelle en los primeros, y principal, le mandò nombrar\r\n     por Alcalde.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 29.\r\n\r\n     [187] _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. v. cap. vii; _Torquemada_, i.\r\n     587. Bernal Diaz skips the regidores. He thinks Villareal was\r\n     not reappointed alférez because of a difficulty with Cortés\r\n     about a Cuban female. _Hist. Verdad._, 29; _Vetancvrt_,\r\n     _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 116. Promotion and other causes\r\n     gave speedy rise to changes among the officials; Ávila, for\r\n     instance, becoming alcalde mayor of New Spain, and Pedro\r\n     de Alvarado alcalde of the town.\r\n\r\n     [188] ‘Los q̄ para esto estauã auisados, sin dar lugar\r\n     a que nadie tomasse la mano. A vozes respõdierõ Cortes,\r\n     Cortes.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. v. cap. vii. Bernal\r\n     Diaz merely intimates that a ‘packed’ meeting was held, by\r\n     stating that the men of Velazquez were furious on finding\r\n     Cortés and the municipality elected, declaring, ‘q̄ no era\r\n     bien hecho sin ser sabidores dello todos los Capitanes, y\r\n     soldados.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 29. This indicates also that\r\n     many of the opponents must have been sent away from camp\r\n     for the occasion, perhaps on board the vessels. Montejo\r\n     had besides a number with him.\r\n\r\n     [189] ‘El qual como si nada supiera del caso, preguntò\r\n     que era lo que mandauã.’ Having signified his acceptance,\r\n     ‘Quisierõ besarle las manos por ello, como cosa al bien de\r\n     todos.’ _Herrera_, ubi sup.\r\n\r\n     [190] Gomara says frankly, ‘Cortés acepto el cargo de capitan\r\n     general y justicia mayor, a pocos ruegos, porq̄ no desseaua\r\n     otra cosa mas por entonces.’ _Hist. Mex._, 48. ‘Y no tuvo\r\n     vergüenza Gomara,’ is Las Casas’ comment on the admission.\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, iv. 496. Bernal Diaz states that Cortés had\r\n     made it a condition, when the army pleaded to remain in the\r\n     country, that he should receive these offices: ‘Y lo peor de\r\n     todo que le otorgamos que le dariamos el quinto del oro.’\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 29. The letter of the ayuntamiento to the\r\n     emperor sets forth that they had represented to Cortés the\r\n     injustice of trading gold for the sole benefit of Velazquez\r\n     and himself, and the necessity of securing the country\r\n     and its wealth for the king by founding a colony, which\r\n     would also benefit them all in the distribution of grants.\r\n     They had accordingly urged him to stop barter as hitherto\r\n     carried on, and to found a town. It is then related how he\r\n     yielded his own interest in favor of king and community,\r\n     and appointed them alcaldes and regidores. His authority\r\n     having in consequence become null, they appointed him in\r\n     the king’s name justicia, alcalde mayor, and captain, as\r\n     the ablest and most loyal man, and in consideration of his\r\n     expenses and services so far. _Carta 10 Jul., 1519_, in\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 19-21. Both Puertocarrero and Montejo\r\n     confirm, in their testimony before the authorities in\r\n     Spain, that Cortés yielded to the general desire in doing\r\n     what he did. _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i. 489, 493-4. According to\r\n     Gomara, Cortés makes a trip into the neighboring country,\r\n     and, finding how rich it is, he proposes to settle, and\r\n     to send the vessels to Cuba for more men wherewith to\r\n     undertake the conquest. This was approved: Cortés accordingly\r\n     appointed the municipality, and resigning the authority\r\n     conferred by the Jeronimite Fathers and by Velazquez, as\r\n     now useless, these officers in turn elected him as their\r\n     captain-general and justicia mayor. The council proposed\r\n     that, since the only provisions remaining belonged to\r\n     Cortés, he should take from the vessels what he needed for\r\n     himself and servants, and distribute the rest among the\r\n     men at a just price, their joint credit being pledged for\r\n     payment. The fleets and outfit were to be accepted by the\r\n     company in the same way, the vessels to be used to carry\r\n     provisions from the islands. Scorning the idea of trading\r\n     his possessions, Cortés surrendered the fleet and effects\r\n     for free distribution among his companions. Although liberal\r\n     at all times with them, this act was prompted by a desire\r\n     to gain good-will. _Hist. Mex._, 46-8; Herrera, dec. ii.\r\n     lib. v. cap. vii.; _Torquemada_, i. 395, 587. Las Casas\r\n     terms the whole transaction, as related by Gomara and the\r\n     ayuntamiento, a plot to defraud Velazquez of his property\r\n     and honors. Comparing the conduct of Cortés with that\r\n     of Velazquez against Colon, he finds the latter trifling\r\n     and pardonable, while the former was a barefaced robbery,\r\n     resulting to Velazquez in loss of fortune, honors, and life.\r\n     The captains were accomplices. _Hist. Ind._, iv. 453, 494-6.\r\n     Peter Martyr gives the facts in brief without venturing an\r\n     opinion, dec. v. cap. i.; _Zumárraga_, in _Ramirez_, _Doc._,\r\n     MS., 271-2. Cortés still held out the offer to furnish a\r\n     vessel for those who preferred to return to Cuba. As for\r\n     Velazquez’ goods, they remained safely in charge of the\r\n     authorized agent, who also recovered the advances made to\r\n     members. See note 5, cap. v.\r\n\r\n     [191] As for the ayuntamiento, the passive recognition\r\n     accorded to it, confirmed as it was by the popularly elected\r\n     general, may be regarded as sufficient. Spanish municipal\r\n     bodies possessed an extensive power conferred upon them\r\n     during successive reigns, chiefly with a view to afford\r\n     the sovereign a support against the assuming arrogance of\r\n     the nobles. Their deliberations were respected; they could\r\n     appoint members, regulate their expenses, and even raise\r\n     troops under their own standard. As an instance of the\r\n     consideration enjoyed by these troops, it is related that\r\n     Isabella the Catholic, when reviewing the army besieging\r\n     Moclin, gave a special salute of respect to the banner of\r\n     Seville. _Alaman_, _Disert._, i. 612; _Zamacois_, _Hist.\r\n     Méj._, ii. 401-2.\r\n\r\n     [192] According to Gomara, Cortés enters the country with\r\n     400 men and all the horses, before the election had been\r\n     mooted. He describes the towns visited. _Hist. Mex._, 46-8.\r\n     Bernal Diaz pronounces the number of men and the time of\r\n     entry false. He also states that Montejo was bought over\r\n     for 2000 pesos and more. _Hist. Verdad._, 30.\r\n\r\n     [193] According to Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 30,\r\n     gold played an important role in effecting this change of\r\n     allegiance, termed by Velazquez, in his Memorials to Spain,\r\n     a witchery. Solis sees nothing but the dignified yet clever\r\n     traits of his hero in all this.\r\n\r\n     [194] The soldiers called them Lopelucios, because their\r\n     first inquiry was Lopelucio, ‘chief,’ whom they wished to\r\n     see. They had not ventured to approach while the Mexicans\r\n     were at the camp. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 28.\r\n\r\n     [195] According to Gomara, followed by Herrera, the Totonacs\r\n     were about twenty in number, and came while Teuhtlile was\r\n     absent on his second mission to Mexico, without bringing\r\n     a direct invitation to the Spaniards. _Hist. Mex._, 43-4.\r\n\r\n     [196] See _Native Races_, v. 475-7.\r\n\r\n     [197] _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 288. This author\r\n     is not very careful, however, and his desire to court\r\n     the Spaniards has no doubt led him to antedate the event.\r\n     Brasseur de Bourbourg accepts his story in full. _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 87-8. A similar revelation is claimed to have\r\n     been made by two Aztec chiefs, Vamapantzin and Atonaltzin,\r\n     who came to the camp in the retinue of the first messengers\r\n     from Mexico. Descendants of the early Aztec kings, and\r\n     discontented with the present ruler, they promised Cortés\r\n     to deliver certain native paintings foretelling the coming\r\n     of white men, to reveal the whereabouts of the imperial\r\n     treasures, and to plot an uprising among native states in\r\n     aid of Spaniards. For these services they received extensive\r\n     grants after the conquest, including that of Ajapusco town.\r\n     The document recording this is a fragment which Zerecero\r\n     parades in the opening part of his _Mem. Rev. Méx._, 8-14,\r\n     as a discovery by him in the Archivo General. It pretends\r\n     to be a title to Ajapusco lands, and contains on the first\r\n     pages a letter signed by Cortés at San Juan de Ulua, ‘20\r\n     March,’ 1519, as ‘Captain-general and governor of these\r\n     New Spains.’ Both the date and titles stamp the letter at\r\n     least as more than suspicious.\r\n\r\n     [198] The natives called it Citlaltepetl, starry mountain,\r\n     with reference probably to the sparks issuing from it. For\r\n     height, etc., see _Humboldt_, _Essai Pol._, i. 273. Brasseur\r\n     de Bourbourg gives it the unlikely name of Ahuilizapan.\r\n     _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 99. The ending ‘pan’ implies a\r\n     district or town, not a mountain. The description in _Carta\r\n     del Ayunt._, in _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 22-3, expresses doubt\r\n     whether the whiteness of the summit is due to snow or to\r\n     clouds.\r\n\r\n     [199] Alvarado chased a deer, and succeeded in wounding\r\n     it, but the next moment the dense underbrush saved it\r\n     from pursuit. The _Carta del Ayunt._, loc. cit., gives a\r\n     list of birds and quadrupeds; and a descriptive account,\r\n     founded greatly on fancy, however, is to be found in the\r\n     curious _Erasmi Francisci Guineischer und Americanischer\r\n     Blumen-Pusch_, Nürnberg, 1669, wherein the compiler presents\r\n     under the title of a nosegay the ‘perfume of the wonders of\r\n     strange animals, of peculiar customs, and of the doings of\r\n     the kings of Peru and Mexico.’ The first of its two parts\r\n     is devoted to the animal kingdom, with particular attention\r\n     to the marvellous, wherein credulity finds free play, as\r\n     may be seen also in the flying dragon of one of the crude\r\n     engravings. In the second part, the aborigines, their\r\n     history, condition, and customs, are treated of, chiefly\r\n     under Peru and Mexico, chapter v. relating specially to\r\n     the latter country. The narrative is quite superficial and\r\n     fragmentary; the ‘nosegay’ being not only common but faded,\r\n     even the style and type appearing antiquated for the date.\r\n     Appended is _Hemmersam_, _Guineische und West-Indianische\r\n     Reissbeschreibung_, with addition by Dietherr, relating to\r\n     Africa and Brazil.\r\n\r\n     [200] ‘A tres leguas andadas llego al rio que parte termino\r\n     con tierras de Montecçuma.’ _Gomara_, _Hist.

By them they\r\n     were guided to the hamlet. _Hist. Mex._, 49. They met one\r\n     hundred men bringing them food. _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 289.

Yet chess remains,\r\nwhile Achilles and his heaven have melted with the mists. Who shall\r\nsay, then, which was the greater, Cortés the soldier, or Cortés\r\nthe diplomate? But these were barbarians, one says, with whom the\r\nshrewd Spaniards had to deal; they had neither horses, nor iron, nor\r\ngunpowder, to aid them in their wars. Furthermore, they regarded the\r\nstrangers fully as demi-gods, probably as some of their own wandering\r\ndeities returned. True; but he makes a great mistake who rates the\r\nMexicans so far beneath Europeans in natural ability and cunning.\r\nMontezuma lacked some of the murderous enginery that Cortés had, and\r\nhis inner life was of different dye; that was about all. If any would\r\nplace Cortés, his genius, and his exploits, below those of the world’s\r\ngreatest generals, because he warred on enemies weaker than their\r\nenemies, we have only to consider the means at his command, how much\r\nless was his force than theirs. What could the Scipios or the Cæsars\r\nhave done with half a thousand men; or Washington, or Wellington,\r\nwith five hundred against five hundred thousand? Napoleon’s tactics\r\nwere always to have at hand more forces than the enemy. In this\r\nthe Corsican displayed his astuteness. But a keener astuteness was\r\nrequired by Cortés to conquer thousands with hundreds and with tens.\r\nPerhaps Moltke, who, with a stronger force, could wage successful war\r\non France, perhaps he, and a handful of his veterans, could land on\r\nthe deadly shores of the Mexican Gulf, and with Montezuma there, and\r\nall the interior as dark to them as Erebus, by strategy and force\r\nof arms possess themselves of the country. I doubt it exceedingly.\r\nI doubt if one in ten of the greatest generals who ever lived would\r\nhave achieved what the base bastard Pizarro did in Peru. The very\r\nqualities which made them great would have deterred them from anything\r\nwhich, viewed in the light of experience and reason, was so wildly\r\nchimerical. Then give these birds of prey their petting, I say; they\r\ndeserve it. And be fame or infamy immortal ever theirs! Lastly, if\r\nany still suspect the genius of Cortés unable to cope with others\r\nthan Indians, let them observe how he handles his brother Spaniards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was about time the municipality should find anchorage; too much\r\ntravelling by a town of such immaculate conception, of so much more\r\nthan ordinary signification, were not seemly. Velazquez would deride\r\nit; the emperor Charles would wonder at it: therefore half a league\r\nbelow Quiahuiztlan, in the dimpled plain which stretches from its base\r\nto the harbor of Bernal at present protecting the ships, where bright\r\nwaters commingling with soft round hills and rugged promontories were\r\nlifted into ethereal heights by the misted sunshine, the whole scene\r\nfalling on the senses like a vision, and not like tame reality, there\r\nthey chose a site for the Villa Rica,[219] and drew a plan of the\r\ntown, distributed lots, laid the foundations for forts and batteries,\r\ngranary, church, town-hall, and other buildings, which were constructed\r\nchiefly of adobe, the whole being inclosed by a strong stockade. To\r\nencourage alike men and officers to push the work, Cortés himself set\r\nthe example in preparing for the structures, and in carrying earth\r\nand stones. The natives also lent their aid, and in a few weeks the\r\ntown stood ready, furnishing a good shipping depot, a fortress for the\r\ncontrol of the interior, a starting-point for operations, an asylum\r\nfor the sick and wounded, and a refuge for the army in case of need.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreat was the excitement in Anáhuac and the regions round about over\r\nthe revolt of the Totonacs and the attitude assumed by the Spaniards;\r\nand while hope swelled the breast of subjected peoples, the Aztec\r\nnobles, seeing revolution in the signs of the times, began to look\r\nto the safety of their families and estates.[220] To Montezuma the\r\nseizure of his collectors was an outrage on the sacredness of his\r\nmajesty, and a slur on his power, which the council declared must be\r\npunished in the most prompt and effective manner, lest other provinces\r\nshould follow the example. And yet the monarch had no stomach for the\r\nbusiness. Ofttimes since these accursed strangers touched his shores\r\nwould he willingly have resigned that which he above all feared to\r\nlose, his sceptre and his life; then again, as appetite returned and\r\nexistence was loaded with affluent pleasure, he sighed to taste the\r\nsweets of power a little longer. He was becoming sadly pusillanimous,\r\nan object of contempt before his gods, his nobles, and himself.\r\nIt seemed to him as if the heavens had fallen on him and held him\r\ninexorably to earth. There was no escape. There were none to pity. He\r\nwas alone. His very gods were recreant, cowering before the approach\r\nof other gods. Repressing his misgivings as best he might, he issued\r\norders for an immediate descent of the army on the offenders. Let the\r\nmettle of these beings be proven, and let them live or die with their\r\nTotonac allies. To this end let levies be made of men and money on a\r\nlong-suffering people, whose murmurs shall be drowned in the groans\r\nof fresh victims on the sacrificial altar of the war god.[221]\r\n\r\nSee now how powerfully had wagged that little forked tongue of Cortés!\r\nSee how those gentle whisperings that night at Quiahuiztlan, those\r\nsoft dissemblings breathed into the ears of two poor captives—see how\r\nthey shot forth like winged swords to stop an army on the point of\r\nmarching to its slaughters! Here, as in scores of other instances,\r\nCortés’ shrewdness saved him from disaster.\r\n\r\nFor in the midst of the warlike preparations arrived the two released\r\ncollectors, and their presentation of the magnanimity of the white\r\nchief, of his friendly conduct and warm assurances, materially changed\r\nthe aspect of affairs. There was no alliance; there was no rebellion;\r\nthe Totonacs dared not rebel without foreign support; with them\r\nMontezuma would settle presently. And with no little alacrity did\r\nhe countermand the order for troops, and send an embassy to Cortés.\r\nThus through the vacillating policy which now possessed the Mexican\r\nmonarch was lost the opportunity to strike the enemy perhaps a fatal\r\nblow; and thus by that far off impalpable breath was fought and won\r\nanother battle, this time vanquishing the king of kings himself, with\r\nhis hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe embassy sent comprised two of Montezuma’s nephews,[222] accompanied\r\nby four old and honorable caciques. They were to express the monarch’s\r\nthanks to the Spaniards, and to remonstrate against the revolt\r\nencouraged by their presence. He had become assured that they were\r\nof the race predicted by his forefathers, and consequently of his own\r\nlineage; out of regard for them, as guests of the revolted people, he\r\nwould withhold present chastisement. A gift of robes and feather-work,\r\nand gold worth two thousand castellanos, accompanied the message.[223]\r\n\r\nWe cannot blame Cortés if his heart danced to its own music as he\r\nassured the envoys that he and all his people continued devoted to\r\ntheir master; in proof of which he straightway produced the other\r\nthree collectors, safe, sound, and arrayed in their new attire.[224]\r\nNevertheless, he could but express displeasure at the abrupt departure\r\nof the Mexicans from the former camp. This act had forced him to seek\r\nhospitality at the hand of the Totonacs, and for their kind reception\r\nof him they deserved to be forgiven. Further than this, they had\r\nrendered the Spaniards great benefits, and should not be expected\r\nto serve two masters, or to pay double tribute; for the rest, Cortés\r\nhimself would soon come to Mexico and arrange everything. The envoys\r\nreplied that their sovereign was too engrossed in serious affairs\r\nto be able as yet to appoint an interview. “Adieu,” they concluded,\r\n“and beware of the Totonacs, for they are a treacherous race.” Not\r\nto create needless alarm, nor leave on the minds of the envoys at\r\ntheir departure unpleasant impressions concerning his projects,\r\nCortés entertained them hospitably, astonished them with cavalry and\r\nother exhibitions, and gratified them with presents. The effect of\r\nthis visit was to raise still higher the Spaniards in the estimation\r\nnot only of the Aztecs, but of the Totonacs, who with amazement saw\r\ncome from the dread Montezuma, instead of a scourging army, this high\r\nembassy of peace. “It must be so,” they said among themselves, “that\r\nthe Mexican monarch stands in awe of the strangers.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot long after, Chicomacatl came to Cortés asking aid against a\r\nMexican garrison, said to be committing ravages at Tizapantzinco,[225]\r\nsome eight leagues from Cempoala. Cortés was in a merry mood at the\r\nmoment; he could see the important progress he was making toward the\r\nconsummation of his desires, though the men of Velazquez could not—at\r\nleast they would admit of nothing honorable or beneficial to Cortés,\r\nand they continued to make much trouble. Here was an opportunity to\r\ntest the credulity of these heathen, how far they might be brought\r\nto believe in the supernatural power of the Spaniards. Among the\r\nmusketeers was an old Biscayan from the Italian wars, Heredia by\r\nname, the ugliest man in the army, uglier than Thersites, who could\r\nnot find his fellow among all the Greeks that came to Troy. Lame\r\nin one foot, blind in one eye, bow-legged, with a slashed face,\r\nbushy-bearded as a lion, this musketeer had also the heart of a lion,\r\nand would march straight into the mouth of Popocatepetl, without a\r\nquestion, at the order of his general. Calling the man to him, Cortés\r\nsaid: “The Greeks worshipped beauty, as thou knowest, good Heredia,\r\nbut these Americans seem to deify deformity, which in thee reaches\r\nits uttermost. Thou art hideous enough at once to awe and enravish\r\nthe Aztecs, whose Pantheon cannot produce thine equal. Go to them,\r\nHeredia; bend fiercely on them thine only eye, walk bravely before\r\nthem, flash thy sword, and thunder a little with thy gun, and thou\r\nshalt at once command a hundred sacrifices.” Then to the Totonac\r\nchief: “This brother of mine is all sufficient to aid thee in thy\r\npurpose. Go, and behold the Culhuas will vanish at thy presence.”\r\nAnd they went; an obedience significant of the estimation in which\r\nCortés was then held, both by his own men and by the natives.\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded far when Cortés sent and recalled them, saying\r\nthat he desired to examine the country, and would accompany them.\r\nTlamamas would be required to carry the guns and baggage, and they\r\nwould set out the next day. At the last moment seven of the Velazquez\r\nfaction refused to go, on the ground of ill health. Then others of\r\ntheir number spoke, condemning the rashness of the present proceeding,\r\nand desiring to return to Cuba. Cortés told them they could go, and\r\nafter chiding them for neglect of duty he ordered prepared a vessel,\r\nwhich should be placed at their service. As they were about to embark,\r\na deputation appeared to protest against permitting any to depart, as\r\na proceeding prejudicial to the service of God, and of the king. “Men\r\nwho at such a moment, and under such circumstances, desert their flag\r\ndeserve death.” These were the words of Cortés put into the mouth of\r\nthe speaker. Of course the order concerning the vessel was recalled,\r\nand the men of Velazquez were losers by the affair.[226]\r\n\r\nThe expedition, composed of four hundred soldiers, with fourteen\r\nhorses, and the necessary carriers, then set off for Cempoala, where\r\nthey were joined by four companies of two thousand warriors. Two days’\r\nmarch brought them close to Tizapantzinco, and the following morning\r\nthey entered the plain at the foot of the fortress, which was strongly\r\nsituated on a high rock bordered by a stream. Here stood the people\r\nprepared to receive them; but scarcely had the cavalry come in sight\r\nwhen they turned to seek refuge within the fort. The horsemen cut off\r\ntheir retreat in that direction, however, and leaving them, began\r\nthe ascent. Eight chiefs and priests thereupon came forth wailing,\r\nand informed the Spaniards that the Mexican garrison had left at the\r\nfirst uprising of the Totonacs, and that the Cempoalans were taking\r\nadvantage of this and of the Spanish alliance to enforce the settlement\r\nof a long-standing boundary dispute. They begged that the army would\r\nnot advance. Cortés at once gave orders to restrain the Cempoalans,\r\nwho were already plundering. Their captains were severely reprimanded\r\nfor want of candor as to the real object of the expedition, and were\r\nordered to restore the effects and captives taken. This strictness\r\nwas by no means confined to them, for a soldier named Mora, caught\r\nby the general in the act of stealing two fowls, was ordered hanged.\r\nAlvarado, however, cut him down in time to save his life, probably\r\nat the secret intimation of Cortés, who, while securing the benefit\r\nof example, would not unnecessarily sacrifice a soldier.[227]\r\n\r\nCharmed by this display of justice on the part of the Spaniards, and\r\nimpressed as well by their ever increasing prestige, the chiefs of\r\nthe district came in and tendered allegiance. A lasting friendship\r\nwas established between them and the Cempoalans;[228] after which the\r\narmy returned to Cempoala by a new route,[229] and was received with\r\ndemonstrations of joy by the populace. With a view of binding more\r\nclosely such powerful allies, Chicomacatl proposed intermarriages. And\r\nas a beginning he presented eight young women,[230] richly dressed,\r\nwith necklaces and ear-rings of gold, and each attended by servants.\r\n“Take them,” said he to Cortés. “They are all daughters of caciques.\r\nSeven are for your captains, and this, my niece, is for yourself,\r\nfor she is the ruler of towns.”\r\n\r\nMatters were becoming interesting. Cortés and some of his captains\r\nhad wives in Cuba, and nearly all of them had mistresses here. The\r\ndamsels of Cempoala were not famed for their beauty; the one offered\r\nCortés was particularly ill-favored. With regard to captives and\r\nslaves, of course no marriage vow was necessary, but with princesses\r\nthe case was different. But even here there was little difficulty. The\r\naboriginal form of marriage, while it satisfied the natives, rested\r\nlightly on the Spaniards. Indeed, with them it was no marriage at\r\nall; and so it has been throughout the New World; in their marital\r\nrelations with foreigners the natives have felt themselves bound,\r\nwhile the Europeans have not. To the ceremony in this instance no\r\nobjection was offered.\r\n\r\nAt this happy consummation, though the rite is not yet performed,\r\nserious meditation takes possession of the mind of Cortés, who bethinks\r\nhimself that he is doing little of late for his God, who is doing so\r\nmuch for him. Success everywhere attends his strategies. And these\r\nfemale slaves and princesses! While trying to quiet his conscience\r\nfor accepting this princess, he was exceedingly careful in regard\r\nto taking unto himself real wives, as we have seen in Cuba. But\r\nhere marriage after the New World fashion would surely advance his\r\npurposes. And so they are compelled to submit to the stronger, who by\r\nthe right of might proceeds to rob them of their gold and to desolate\r\ntheir homes; and now assumes the higher prerogative of requiring them\r\nto relinquish the faith of their fathers and embrace the religion\r\nof their enemies. It would please God to have these Cempoala people\r\nworship him; Cortés can make them do so. True, they love their gods\r\nas much as Cortés loves his. Their gods likewise help them to good\r\nthings, among others to the Spaniards themselves, who in return now\r\ndetermine their overthrow. And shall they consent! Alas, they are\r\nweak, and their gods are weak!\r\n\r\nHeathenism, with its idolatry, and bloody sacrifices, and cannibalism,\r\nis horrible, I grant you. “For daily they sacrificed three or five\r\nIndians,” says Bernal Diaz, “offering the heart to idols, smearing\r\nthe blood upon the walls, and cutting off the limbs to be eaten. I\r\neven believe they sold the flesh in the market.”[231] But equally\r\nhorrible, and far more unfair, are the doings of the superior race,\r\nwhich with the advance of the centuries, and the increase of knowledge\r\nand refinement, are often guilty of deeds as bloodthirsty and cruel as\r\nthese. With the most powerful of microscopic aids to vision, I can see\r\nno difference between the innate goodness and badness of men now and\r\ntwo or five thousand years ago; the difference lies merely in a change\r\nof morality fashions, and in the apparent refining and draping of what\r\nconventionally we choose to call wickedness. What is the serving of\r\ndainty dishes to the gods in the form of human sacrifices, of carving\r\nbefore them a few thousand fattened captives, to the extirpation of\r\na continent of helpless human beings; and that by such extremes of\r\ntreachery and cruelty as the cannibals never dreamed of, entrapping\r\nby fair words only to cut, and mangle, and kill by steel, saltpetre,\r\nand blood-hounds; stealing at the same time their lands and goods,\r\nand adding still more to their infamy by doing all this in the name\r\nof Christ; when in reality they violate every principle of religion\r\nand disregard every injunction of the church; just as men to-day lie\r\nand cheat and praise and pray, and out of their swindlings hope to\r\nbuy favor of the Almighty!\r\n\r\nAnd now these poor people must give up their poor gods, for their\r\nmasters so decree. The chiefs and native priests protest. The Spaniards\r\nare benefactors and friends, but the gods are superior to men. To\r\nthem they owe health, prosperity, existence; and sacrifices are but\r\nthe necessary slight returns for so great blessings. The sacrificed\r\nare by no means injured, say the Aztecs, but are sent to heaven and\r\nenfolded at once in the bosom of their god. Verily there are curious\r\narticles of faith among the heathen worshipers as well as among our\r\nown, but if we look for all the good in ours we shall be mistaken.\r\nIn vain the men of Cempoala beg to retain the religion of their\r\nforefathers and the sacred emblems of their faith. Carried away by\r\nthe fierce zeal which more than once in these annals overcomes his\r\nprudence and brings him to the brink of ruin, Cortés cries: “Christians\r\nand soldiers, shall these things be—these idolatries and sacrifices,\r\nand other impious doings? No! First down with the images, then to\r\narguments, and the granting of entreaties. Our lives on work rewarded\r\nwith eternal glory!” Shouts of earnest approval was the response,\r\nand on they marched toward the temple. Priests and people rushed to\r\nthe defence of their deities. With a scornful gesture the ruler was\r\nwaived aside, as he interposed with the warning that to lay hands\r\non the idols was to bring destruction alike on all. “You are not my\r\nfriends,” exclaimed Cortés, “if you do not as I wish! Choose ye; and\r\nI will leave you your gods to save you from the threatened vengeance\r\nof Montezuma.” This was by far too practical an application of their\r\npiety. The fact is, their gods had not done exactly right by them\r\nin the matter of the Aztec imposition. These white strangers, after\r\nall, seemed to be better gods than their idols. “Well, work your\r\nwill,” at length said Chicomacatl, “but do not ask our aid in such\r\ndetestable doings.” So the thing was accomplished, as before this\r\nhad been determined. In a moment fifty soldiers were on the temple\r\nsummit, and down came the worshipful wooden things, shattered and\r\nclattering along the steps, while with bleeding hearts their makers\r\nstood by, their faces covered to exclude the sacrilegious sight. Ah,\r\nhow they wailed, how they lamented, calling on the misshapen blocks\r\nto pity their inability to stop the deed![232]\r\n\r\nNot such dastards were these people, however, that not one among them\r\nwould strike a blow for their faith. For presently the court-yard was\r\nfilled with armed men, headed by infuriated priests in long hooded\r\nrobes of dark material, with slashed ears and faces clotted with blood,\r\ndetermined, if not to prevent, at least to avenge the outrage. What\r\nwas sworn allegiance, or even life, beside the momentous question of\r\nreligion? Seeing the danger, Cortés with characteristic promptness\r\nseized the lord, together with several leading men, and declared if\r\na single Spaniard was so much as scratched they should immediately\r\ndie. Chicomacatl accordingly spoke to the people and made them retire.\r\nNor was wholly lost on them the mute argument of the shattered idols\r\nlying powerless at their feet. Hence when the images were burned, the\r\nnatives looked on with comparative calmness. “Surely these beings are\r\nsuperior to our gods, whom they have thus vanquished,” they said one to\r\nanother. Sweetly and serenely Cortés now smiled on them, called them\r\nbrethren, and preached the European doctrines. The pagan temple was\r\ncleansed, the blood-smeared walls were whitewashed, and in their place\r\nwas erected a Christian altar, decorated with flowers and surmounted\r\nwith a cross. Here, before the assembled natives, Olmedo preached the\r\nChristian faith, and celebrated mass. The contrast between the simple\r\nbeauty of this impressive ceremony and their own bloody worship made\r\na deep impression on the minds of the natives, and at the conclusion\r\nthose who desired were baptized. Among them were the eight brides,\r\nthe ill-favored ruler of towns who had been given to Cortés being\r\ncalled Catalina, probably in honor of his wife in Cuba, whose place\r\nshe was to occupy for a time. Lucky Puertocarrero’s second pretty\r\nprize, the daughter of Cacique Cuesco, was named Francisca.[233]\r\n\r\nAccompanied by the brides and a large escort the army now returned to\r\nVilla Rica. There they found just arrived from Cuba a vessel commanded\r\nby Francisco de Salcedo, nicknamed ‘the dandy,’ who with Luis Marin, an\r\nable officer, and ten soldiers, all well provided with arms, and with\r\ntwo horses, had come in quest of fortune under Cortés.[234] Salcedo\r\nreported that Velazquez had received the appointment of adelantado\r\nover all lands discovered by him or at his cost, with one fifteenth\r\nof all royal revenues thence arising.[235]\r\n\r\nBenito Martin, the chaplain, who had been sent to obtain the\r\ncommission, was rewarded with the benefice of the new discovery at\r\nUlua, which really comprised all Mexico, while the lately appointed\r\nbishop of Cuba, the Dominican Julian Garcés, confessor to the bishop\r\nof Búrgos, the patron of Velazquez, was promoted to the insignificant\r\nsee of Cozumel. These preferments, based on an insufficient knowledge\r\nof the country, were corrected at a later time, when Garcés was made\r\nbishop of Tlascala, while Martin received other compensation.[236]\r\nBefore the issue of these grants it appears that Yucatan at least\r\nhad a narrow escape from slipping entirely out of Spanish hands. At\r\nthe first news of Córdoba’s discoveries the admiral of Flanders was\r\ninduced to ask for the land in grant, in order to settle it with\r\nFlemings, and also to petition for the governorship of Cuba as a means\r\nto promote the colony. This was supported by Xèvres, the chief adviser\r\nin such matters, who knew little of the Indies and the vast tracts\r\nreferred to, and so the promise was given. Las Casas was in Spain\r\nat the time, and being consulted by the admiral as to the means for\r\ncolonizing, became indignant at the rash concession of Cuba, which\r\nhe considered as belonging to Columbus. He remonstrated, and warned\r\nthose interested to do the same. The result was the withdrawal of\r\nthe grant, greatly to the disappointment of the admiral, for whose\r\naccount several vessels had already reached San Lúcar, laden with\r\nFlemish settlers.[237]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCortés was fully aware that Velazquez, possessed of a commission,\r\nwould not long delay in asserting his claim with all the power at his\r\ncommand upon the islands, and with all his influence at court; this\r\nspurred on the captain-general to lose no time in bringing forward\r\nhis own pretensions, and in seeking to obtain royal approval of his\r\nacts. Therefore at this juncture he determined to gain authority for\r\neffectually supplanting the Cuban governor in the field wherein he\r\nhad already openly ignored him, and to despatch messengers to the\r\nking. The men of Cortés needed no prompting to see how necessary to\r\ntheir interest it was to procure his confirmation as general to the\r\nexclusion of Velazquez, and to support Cortés by writing reports\r\nin corroboration of his own statements. Yet, in view of the flowing\r\nin of exaggerated accounts concerning new discoveries, little would\r\navail descriptions of conquests and resources, however glowing, and\r\nrecommendations however warm, unless made real by specimens of the\r\ntreasures which were the main attraction alike to king and subject.\r\nFor gifts can move gods, says Hesiod. To the crown was due one fifth\r\nof the wealth so far obtained, but fearing that this would hardly\r\nproduce the effect desired, Cortés proposed to surrender the one\r\nfifth due himself, and prevailed on his friends, and with their aid\r\non all members of the expedition, to give up their share in the finer\r\npieces of wrought gold and silver, and in all choice articles, so\r\nthat a gift worthy of themselves and the country might be presented\r\nto the king.[238]\r\n\r\nThe flag-ship was prepared for the voyage, and the navigation intrusted\r\nto Alaminos and another pilot called Bautista, with fifteen sailors\r\nand the necessary outfit. Four Indians, rescued from the sacrificial\r\ncage at Cempoala, where they had been kept to fatten, were also\r\nsent on board, together with native curiosities, including specimens\r\nof picture-writing. The difficult task of out-manœuvring Velazquez\r\nand securing the aims of their party was intrusted to the alcaldes\r\nPuertocarrero and Montejo, the former being selected chiefly because\r\nof his high connections, which might serve him at court, the latter\r\nfor his business talent. Three thousand castellanos were given them\r\nfrom the treasury for expenses, together with the necessary power and\r\ninstructions, and three letters in duplicate for the king. One of these\r\nwas the first of the celebrated letters of Cortés on the conquest.\r\nHe related at length all that had occurred since he left Santiago;\r\nthe difficulties with Velazquez, the hardships of the voyage, and\r\nthe progress of conquest for God and the king. He dwelt on the vast\r\nextent and wealth of the country, and expressed the hope of speedily\r\nsubjecting it to the crown, and of seizing the person of the great\r\nMontezuma. And he trusted that in return for his services and loyal\r\ndevotion he would be remembered in the cédulas to be issued for this\r\nnew addition to the empire.[239]\r\n\r\nThe second letter was by the ayuntamiento of Villa Rica, dated July 10,\r\n1519,[240] covering not only the same ground, but giving an account\r\nof the voyages of discovery by Córdoba and Grijalva, the reasons for\r\nfounding a colony, and for Cortés’ appointment. The features of the\r\ncountry, its resources and inhabitants, were touched upon, and the\r\nbelief expressed that of gold, silver, and precious stones “there\r\nis in the land as much as in that where it is said Solomon took the\r\ngold for the temple.” Velazquez was exposed as a cruel, dishonest,\r\nand incompetent governor, and as such most dangerous to be intrusted\r\nwith the control of these vast and rich territories. They asked for\r\nan investigation to prove the charges, as well as the propriety of\r\ntheir own acts; and concluded by recommending that Cortés, whose\r\ncharacter and conduct stamped him a loyal subject and an able leader,\r\nbe confirmed in his offices, till the conquest of the country, at\r\nleast, should have been achieved.[241]\r\n\r\nThe third letter, even longer than this, though of similar tenor, was\r\nsigned by the representative men in the army,[242] and concluded by\r\npraying that their services and hardships be rewarded with grants,\r\nand that Cortés be confirmed in the government till the king might be\r\npleased to appoint an infante or a grandee of the highest class, for\r\nso large and rich a country ought to be ruled by none else. Should\r\nthe designing bishop of Búrgos of his accord “send us a governor or\r\ncaptain, before we obey him we shall inform your royal person.” This\r\nsentence, which Las Casas characterizes as a “great though sweetened\r\npiece of impudence,” and several others not in harmony with Cortés’\r\nown calculated report, were probably the cause for the disappearance\r\nof the letter before it reached the emperor.[243]\r\n\r\nThe messengers or procuradores left the port July 16,[244] and\r\nalthough ordered not to touch Cuba, lest Velazquez should learn of\r\nthe mission, Montejo could not resist the temptation of taking a peep\r\nat his estates at Mariel de Cuba, a port close to Habana. Here they\r\nentered August 23, and took supplies and water. This could not of\r\ncourse be done in secret, and swelling with rumor the report reached\r\nVelazquez that his flag-ship had come ballasted with gold, to the\r\nvalue of two hundred and seventy thousand pesos. No less alarmed\r\nthan furious at this proof of the perfidy he had so long feared, he\r\ndespatched a fast sailing vessel with a strong force under Gonzalo\r\nde Guzman, the royal treasurer, to capture her; but she had stayed\r\nonly three days at Mariel, and then passed safely through the Bahamas\r\nChannel, the first to make that passage.[245]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the messengers at Seville, in October, created no\r\nsmall stir, and aided by their treasures and reports they became\r\nthe heroes of the hour. But their triumph was of short duration; for\r\nBenito Martin, the chaplain of Velazquez, happened to be at the port.\r\nThis man at once laid claim to the vessel for his master, denounced\r\nthe persons on board as traitors, and prevailed upon the Casa de\r\nContratacion to seize the ship, together with the private funds of the\r\ncommission, as well as certain money sent by Cortés for his father. A\r\nstill stronger opponent appeared in the person of Fonseca, bishop of\r\nBúrgos, whose interest in Velazquez, fostered by a long interchange\r\nof favors, was strengthened by a projected marriage of the governor\r\nwith his niece.[246] Detaining the messengers and their papers by\r\ndeferred promises and other measures,[247] he filled the royal ear\r\nwith the most damaging charges against them and their party in behalf\r\nof his protégé.\r\n\r\nVelazquez had meanwhile been taking testimony against Cortés, and\r\nhad sent treasurer Guzman to Spain with documents and instructions\r\nto join Martin in pressing his suit before the bishop.[248]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCharles V. had been elected emperor, and was busy in Spain raising\r\nsupplies and making preparations on a vast scale for presenting\r\nan appearance in Germany befitting so high a dignity. Previous to\r\nembarking for Flanders he was to meet the cortes at Compostela. The\r\nmessengers from New Spain could afford to lose no more time, and so\r\nwith the aid of Puertocarrero’s friends and the men opposed to Fonseca,\r\namong them the Licenciado Nuñez, relator of the royal council and\r\nrelated to Cortés, they slipped away, and in company with Alaminos and\r\nMartin Cortés, managed to be presented to the monarch at Tordesillas,\r\nin the beginning of March.[249] The king was not a little pleased\r\nwith the reports, gilded as they were with the richest presents that\r\nhad as yet reached him from his American possessions,[250] but he was\r\nunfortunately too absorbed with the imperial crown and the preparations\r\nfor departure to give more than a passing attention to the subject,\r\nand still less would he enter into the merits of the claims presented.\r\nFinding, however, that Fonseca had not been impartial in the matter,\r\nhe was prevailed on to refer it to Cardinal Adrian, and the junta of\r\nprelates and ministers governing the kingdom during the royal absence,\r\nbefore whom the Council of the Indies had also to lay its reports.\r\nThe messengers were meanwhile allowed under bond to receive from the\r\nseized funds what was needed for their support.[251] The powerful\r\nFonseca managed, however, by misrepresentation and other means, to\r\ndelay the case, and for about two years it dragged its weary length.\r\nAnd yet, where a man is strong enough to carve out his own fortune,\r\nparticularly where the administration of strict justice might send\r\nhis neck to the halter, the law’s delay and its susceptibility to\r\nperversion may be most fortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [219] Villa Rica is the name appearing in the first royal\r\n     charter of 1523, but with later foundations Vera Cruz\r\n     became the title. _Panes_, _Extension Veracruz_, MS., 1 et\r\n     seq. The municipal council, however, distinctly calls it\r\n     _la Rica Villa de la Veracruz_ and ought to be the proper\r\n     authority for the form of name first applied. _Carta del\r\n     Ayunt._, in _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 1 et seq. ‘Y luego ordenamos\r\n     de hazer, y fundar, è poblar vna Villa, que se nombró la\r\n     Villa Rica de la Vera-Cruz; porque llegamos Jueves de la\r\n     Cena, y desembarcamos en Uiernes Santo de la Cruz, é rica\r\n     por aquel Cauallero que ... dixo que mirasse las tierras\r\n     ricas.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 29. ‘Llamola\r\n     Villa Rica a la nueua poblaciõ, y de la Veracruz, por auer\r\n     desembarcado el Viernes Sãto, y Rica, por la riqueza que se\r\n     auia descubierto.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. v. cap. vii.\r\n     Although nominally founded adjacent to San Juan de Ulua,\r\n     there was no intention to build the town on that unhealthy\r\n     and dreary spot. The first actual foundation took place\r\n     at the harbor of Bernal. Nearly five years later the town\r\n     rose anew on the present Rio de la Antigua, where it became\r\n     known alone as Vera Cruz. In 1599 the actual or new Vera\r\n     Cruz found itself finally planted on the very site of the\r\n     first nominal foundation. The chief reason for this change\r\n     was probably the need for the better protection against\r\n     filibusters afforded by the island of San Juan de Ulua,\r\n     whose batteries commanded the harbor. See _Albornoz_, _Carta\r\n     al Emperador_, Dec., 1525, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._,\r\n     i. 495. The charter for la Nueva Ciudad de la Vera-Cruz\r\n     was granted July 19, 1615. _Calle_, _Mem. y Not._, 68;\r\n     _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 30; _Rivera_, _Hist.\r\n     Jalapa_, i. 27; _Humboldt_, _Essai Pol._, i. 276-7. Alegre,\r\n     _Hist. Comp. de Jesus_, i. 149-50, has some excellent remarks\r\n     hereon. Few authors, however, are free from blunders with\r\n     regard to the different sites, even Lorenzana committing more than\r\n     one. _Cortés_, _Hist. N. España_, 381.\r\n\r\n     [220] ‘Los Hombres mas Poderosos entendian en buscar Lugares\r\n     en los Montes, y partes mas remotas, para conservar sus\r\n     Mugeres, Hijos, y Hacienda.’ _Torquemada_, i. 403.\r\n\r\n     [221] Inconsolable at the prospect of the strangers acquiring\r\n     a footing in the country, Montezuma, after vainly searching\r\n     for admission into the Hades of Cicalco, retired to the\r\n     abode occupied by him ere he became emperor. _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist. Conq._, i. 15-16. One reason for this is said to have\r\n     been the result of the embassy to the oracle at Achiuhtla,\r\n     in Miztecapan, which brought back the announcement that\r\n     the Aztec empire must yield to strangers. _Burgoa_, _Geog.\r\n     Descrip. Oajaca_, pt. ii. 129.\r\n\r\n     [222] ‘Figliuoli porse del suo fratello Cuitlahuatzin.’\r\n     _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 30.\r\n\r\n     [223] ‘Ciertas pieças de oro y plata bien labradas, y vn\r\n     casquete de oro menudo....

Other authorities\r\n     differ in the spelling.\r\n\r\n     [226] One of them who had bartered a fine light-colored horse\r\n     for some property in Cuba was unable to annul the trade,\r\n     and thus lost his animal. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     34. Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 64, refers merely to murmurs in\r\n     favor of Velazquez, which Cortés quiets by placing a few\r\n     in chains for a time.\r\n\r\n     [227] ‘Muriò este soldado en vna guerra en la Prouincia de\r\n     Guatimala sobre vn Peñol.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     35. He places the incident on the return march.\r\n\r\n     [228] According to Gomara the Aztec garrison does ravage\r\n     the country when the Totonac revolt occurs, and their forces\r\n     meet the Spaniards on the field, only to flee at the sight of\r\n     the horsemen. Cortés and four others dismount, and mingling\r\n     with the fleeing, reach the fort gates, which they hold\r\n     till their troops come up. Surrendering the place to the\r\n     allies, Cortés tells them to respect the people and to let\r\n     the garrison depart without arms or banner. This victory\r\n     gained great influence for the Spaniards, and remembering\r\n     the feat of Cortés, the Indians declared that one Spaniard\r\n     was enough to aid them in achieving victory. _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     59. Ixtlilxochitl, who follows Gomara, fights the Aztec\r\n     garrison as far as the city, and then captures it. _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 290. Solis assumes that a few Spaniards cut off\r\n     the retreat of the townsmen, and rushing forward with some\r\n     Cempoalans, are already inside when the leaders come to\r\n     plead for mercy. _Hist. Mex._, i. 197-8. The foremost credit\r\n     is however due to Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 34-5, who,\r\n     being present, declares Gomara’s account wholly wrong, that\r\n     no garrison existed here, and that no resistance was made.\r\n     The latter sentence is modified by Tapia, also a member of\r\n     the expedition, who states that the town did resist and was\r\n     punished. _Relacion_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii.\r\n     566. Hence it may be assumed that Diaz, as a foot soldier,\r\n     was not present to see the probably bloodless rout of the\r\n     Indians by the cavalry. The townsmen are not likely to\r\n     have allowed the Cempoalans to approach without offering\r\n     resistance, or, in case they knew of the Spanish advance,\r\n     without sending a deputation before the pillage began.\r\n\r\n     [229] Passing through two towns, the soldiers suffering\r\n     greatly from heat and fatigue. Near Cempoala the lord\r\n     awaited them in some temporary huts with bountiful cheer,\r\n     though apprehensive of Cortés’ anger at his deception. The\r\n     following day they entered the city. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 35; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. v. cap. xiii.\r\n\r\n     [230] ‘Veinte Doncellas (aunque Gomara dice, que fueron\r\n     ocho),’ says Torquemada, i. 399, without giving his reasons.\r\n\r\n     [231] ‘Tambien auian de ser limpios de sodomias, porque\r\n     tenian muchachos vestidos en habito de mugeres, que andauan â\r\n     ganar en aquel maldito oficio.’ This they promised. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 35. Solis assumes that Cortés was\r\n     aroused to this crusade by the heavy sacrifices at a great\r\n     festival. _Hist. Mex._, i. 204-5.\r\n\r\n     [232] Gomara makes the natives tear down the idols and the\r\n     sepulchres of caciques worshipped as gods. ‘Acabo con los\r\n     de la ciudad que derribassen los idolos y sepulcros de los\r\n     caciques, q̄ tambien reuerẽciauan como a dioses.’ _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 67.\r\n\r\n     [233] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 36; _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. v. cap. ix. xiv. Gomara places the presentation\r\n     of the women at the first visit of the Spaniards to the\r\n     city, and herein he is followed by Herrera, Torquemada,\r\n     and Ixtlilxochitl. _Hist. Chich._, 289.\r\n\r\n     [234] These proved the more valuable since Cortés’ horse\r\n     had died shortly before. He obtained, by gift or purchase,\r\n     the fine Arriero, a dark chestnut belonging to Ortiz, the\r\n     musician, and to García, the miner. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 33. Gomara assumes that Salcedo brought a caravel,\r\n     with sixty Spaniards and nine horses, the vessel having\r\n     been detained in Cuba for repairs. _Hist. Mex._, 59; yet\r\n     he includes Salcedo as present at the final review there.\r\n     _Id._, 14. He is evidently confused.\r\n\r\n     [235] For himself and one heir. Further, after conquering\r\n     and settling four islands, he might select one from which\r\n     to receive perpetually for himself and heirs one twentieth\r\n     part of all the revenue accruing therefrom for the king.\r\n     No duty would be charged during his life on any clothing,\r\n     arms, and provisions imported by him into those lands. As\r\n     an aid toward the expenses of the conquest, a royal estate\r\n     at Habana was granted him, and a salary in those lands\r\n     of 300,000 maravedís. The other clauses of the commission\r\n     related to mines, clergy, taxes, and settlers. It was dated\r\n     at Saragossa, November 13, 1518, ‘five days previous to the\r\n     usurpation of the fleet by Cortés,’ observes Las Casas,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, v. 3-5. Dated at Barcelona, says Herrera,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. iii. cap. xi. Several are led to suppose that\r\n     Velazquez did not receive the notice of his appointment for\r\n     over a year after its date, which is unlikely. _Mex._, ii.\r\n     222-3.\r\n\r\n     [236] Which he failed to enjoy, since he died at sea while\r\n     en route to New Spain to take possession. _Las Casas_,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, iv. 465-6; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap.\r\n     xi.; _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_, 16-17.\r\n\r\n     [237] Many of these died from hardship, and the rest\r\n     returned impoverished to their country. _Las Casas_, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, iv. 374-6; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. ii. cap. xix.;\r\n     _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_, 8.\r\n\r\n     [238] It has been generally assumed, from a loose\r\n     acceptance of chroniclers’ text, that all the treasures\r\n     were surrendered for the object in view, but this could\r\n     not have been the case. The pile of gold dust and nuggets,\r\n     accumulated by constant barter along the coast, and increased\r\n     by the contents of two helmets sent by Montezuma, formed\r\n     a respectable amount, of which only a small portion was\r\n     sent to the king, as specimens of mining products. Three\r\n     thousand castellanos were set aside for the expenses of the\r\n     messengers to Spain, and an equal sum for Cortés’ father,\r\n     ‘Otros 3000 que Cortés enviaba para su padre.’ _Las Casas_,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, iv. 498. ‘A su padre Martin Cortes y a su\r\n     madre ciertos Castellanos.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 62.\r\n     The disposal of the dust alone indicates an apportionment.\r\n     Further, the list of treasure sent to Spain, as appended to\r\n     the _Carta del Ayuntamiento_, and as given by Gomara, shows\r\n     that much of the wrought metal received from Montezuma,\r\n     not counting that acquired by barter, was retained by the\r\n     expedition. Gomara writes that the first step of Cortés was\r\n     to order a division of treasures by Ávila and Mejía, acting\r\n     respectively for the crown and the army. All the effects\r\n     being displayed in the plaza, the gold and silver amounting\r\n     to 27,000 ducats, the cabildo observed that what remained\r\n     after deducting the royal fifth would belong to the general\r\n     in payment for the vessels, arms, and supplies surrendered\r\n     by him to the company. Cortés said there was time enough to\r\n     pay him; he would now take only his share as captain-general,\r\n     and leave others wherewith to settle their small debts. He\r\n     also proposed that instead of sending merely the one fifth\r\n     to the king, the finest specimens should be given, which\r\n     was agreed to. His list is given in _Hist. Mex._, 60-2.\r\n     Ordaz and Montejo were sent round with a list to be signed\r\n     by all who wished to surrender their share in the gold.\r\n     ‘Y desta manera todos lo firmaron â vna.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 36. The _Carta del Ayunt._ refers to four\r\n     of Velazquez’ men as objecting to the presents being sent\r\n     elsewhere than to their leader. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 26-7;\r\n     _Tapia_, _Relacion_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.

Gomara alone gives\r\n     a brief outline of the letter, but the original or copy has\r\n     never been found, notwithstanding the close search made.\r\n     Since Charles V. received it on the eve of his departure\r\n     for Germany, it occurred to Robertson that the Vienna\r\n     archives might throw on it some light, and the consequent\r\n     search led to the discovery of an authenticated copy of the\r\n     companion letter from the municipality of Villa Rica, but\r\n     nothing relating to Cortés’ report. _Hist. Am._, preface,\r\n     x.-xi. Panes insists that the letter must have existed in\r\n     the Vienna Court Library at one time. _Doc. Domin. Esp._,\r\n     MS., 59-60. Barcia suggests several ways in which it might\r\n     have been lost; one being its production before the royal\r\n     council at the instance of Pánfilo de Narvaez. _Bibl.\r\n     Occid._, tit. iv. ii. 598. Fortunately the companion letter\r\n     and other narratives cover its essential points.\r\n\r\n     [240] ‘El Cabildo escriuiò juntamente con diez soldados ...\r\n     ê iva yo firmado en ella.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     36.\r\n\r\n     [241] Written by Cortés’ most devoted friends, and\r\n     undoubtedly under his supervision, we cannot expect to\r\n     find it other than a labored effort to promote his views.\r\n     Robertson, whose suggestion led to its discovery in the\r\n     Vienna Imperial Library, offers a mere synopsis of the\r\n     contents. _Hist. Am._, preface, p. xi. ii. 521-2. It is\r\n     given at length in the _Cortés_, _Cartas_, by Gayangos,\r\n     Paris, 1866, 1-34, with notes, and with the list of presents\r\n     appended; and in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i. 417-72, and in\r\n     _Alaman_, _Disert._, i. 2d app., 41-104, preceded by an\r\n     introductory sketch of the expedition by the collector of\r\n     the papers, and containing the list of presents as checked\r\n     by Muñoz in 1784 from the Manual del Tesorero de la Casa\r\n     de la Contratacion de Sevilla.\r\n\r\n     [242] ‘Todos los Capitanes, y soldados juntamente escriuimos\r\n     otra carta.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 36. ‘El cabildo\r\n     ... escriuio ... dos letras. Vna ... no firmaron sino\r\n     alcaldes y regidores. La otra fue acordada y firmada del\r\n     cabildo y de todos los mas principales.’ _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 63.\r\n\r\n     [243] Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 37, gives a long detail\r\n     of its contents, particularly of the conclusion, wherein\r\n     the bishop of Búrgos is pointed out as favoring his friends\r\n     and relations in the distribution of Indian governments.\r\n     Velazquez enjoyed his special favor in return for the large\r\n     presents in gold and towns he had made, to the prejudice\r\n     of the crown. Cortés, on reading the letter, was highly\r\n     pleased with the eulogy bestowed upon himself, and promised\r\n     to remember it when rewards came to be distributed, but\r\n     he objected to the prominence given to the discoveries\r\n     of Córdoba and Grijalva, ‘sino á èl solo se atribuia el\r\n     descubrimiento, y la honra, ê honor de todo,’ and wished to\r\n     suppress the statement that one fifth of the profits were\r\n     to be given to him. The men declined to hide anything from\r\n     the king, and so Cortés no doubt made the messengers hide\r\n     the letter. Tapia gives a brief synopsis of it, mentioning\r\n     the objections raised against the bishop of Búrgos, and\r\n     the resolution not to obey any orders contrary to their\r\n     report till the king had replied to it—‘é para que otra\r\n     cosa en contrario de lo que le escrebiamos no se hiciese,\r\n     que S. M. sin saber de qué hacia mercedes, no las hiciese,\r\n     estábamos prestos de morir é tener la tierra en su real\r\n     nombre fasta ver respuesta de esta carta.’ _Relacion_, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 566. ‘Esta carta no vido\r\n     el Emperador, porque, si la viera, no les sucederia ni á\r\n     Cortés ni á sus consortes el negocio tan favorable como\r\n     abajo se parecerá.’ _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 498.\r\n\r\n     [244] ‘En una nao que ... despaché á 16 de julio del año\r\n     de 1519, envié a V. A. muy larga y particular relacion.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 51; _Oviedo_, iii. 261. ‘En veinte y\r\n     seis dias del mes de Julio ... partieron de San Juan de\r\n     Ulua.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 37. On the next\r\n     page he says July 6th. The naming of Ulua as the port of\r\n     departure shows also a carelessness of facts; yet Gomara\r\n     says:‘Partieron ... de Aquiahuiztlã ... a veinte y seis.’\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 6. Still Cortés’ letter, written so soon\r\n     after, ought to be correct. Prescott accepts the 26th.\r\n\r\n     [245] ‘Esta fuga fue ocasion de descubrir el derrotero de la\r\n     Canal de Bahama, para la buelta de España, hasta entonces\r\n     no nauegada, y desde aquella ocasion siempre seguida.’\r\n     _Cogolludo_, _Hist. Yucathan_, 41. ‘Alaminos ... fue el\r\n     primero que nauegò por aquella canal.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 36-39. Prejudiced against Montejo, as shown by\r\n     previous expressions, this author accuses him of sending\r\n     letters to Velazquez by a sailor, who spread the news of\r\n     the mission along his route. Some of the letters were from\r\n     adherents in Cortés’ army. ‘Pareciò, de otras personas\r\n     principales que estauan en nuestro Real, fueron aconsejados\r\n     que fuessen á aquella estancia ... y aun escriuieron para\r\n     que el Diego Velazquez tuuiesse tiempo de auellos á las\r\n     manos.’ Velazquez accordingly sends two small vessels under\r\n     Gabriel de Rojas and Guzman to pursue the ship, but their\r\n     cruise between Habana and the Bahamas Channel is in vain.\r\n     Montejo’s conduct before and after this indicates nothing\r\n     that can justify the accusations, and Velazquez, in his\r\n     letter to Figueroa, juez de residencia in Española, inveighs\r\n     against one ‘Montejo’ and his companion for taking not\r\n     only provisions and forty butts of water, but a number of\r\n     Indians from Mariel, and then leaving ‘without informing\r\n     any magistrate or other person,’ taking a dangerous and\r\n     hitherto unknown route. In _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i.\r\n     401. During the investigation held on the subject by the\r\n     governor, it appeared that Juan de Rojas of Habana reported\r\n     the secret visit of Montejo, who, knowing that Rojas had\r\n     become aware of his presence, wrote him at the moment of\r\n     leaving that he was going to visit Velazquez. From Perez,\r\n     a servant of Rojas and in charge at Mariel, it seems, he\r\n     exacted an oath not to reveal what he had learned of the\r\n     rich cargo and destination of the vessel. Rojas nevertheless\r\n     obtained the facts from him. _Testimonio_, in _Pacheco_ and\r\n     _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xii. 151-204. In a letter to the\r\n     bishop of Búrgos, October 12, 1519, Velazquez states that a\r\n     man at Mariel, Perez probably, was at the last moment shown\r\n     the treasures. Guzman was sent with a vessel in pursuit. In\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xii. 248-50. Gomara\r\n     also says, ‘embiando tras ella vna carauela de armada.’\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 64; _Torquemada_, i. 407.\r\n\r\n     [246] ‘Doña Mayor de Fonseca. El obispo de Búrgos ... por\r\n     la muerte del Gran Chanciller ... tornó á alear y á ser\r\n     principal.’ _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, v. 2; _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. iii. cap. xi.; _Zúñiga_, _Anales Ecles. Sevilla_,\r\n     414.\r\n\r\n     [247] The bishop of Búrgos, then at Valladolid, spoke\r\n     so harshly to Puertocarrero that the latter ventured to\r\n     remonstrate, and demand that their messages be forwarded to\r\n     the king. A charge was now raked up against Puertocarrero of\r\n     having three years before carried off a woman from Medellin\r\n     to the Indies, and for this he was cast into prison. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 38; _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._,\r\n     pt. iii. 119.\r\n\r\n     [248] Guzman appears to have started in October from Cuba,\r\n     when Narvaez’ expedition against Cortés had already begun\r\n     to be fitted out. _Carta de Velazquez_, Oct. 12, 1519, in\r\n     _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i. 472-5; _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, xii. 246-51; _Carta al Figueroa_, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 402; _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, v. 2. His\r\n     appeal to the Jeronimite Fathers, says Bernal Diaz, met\r\n     only with rebuff. They considered that Cortés had done\r\n     well to send so rich a present to the king. ‘Le embiaron al\r\n     Diego Velazquez â Cuba â vn Licenciado que se dezia Zuazo\r\n     para que le tomasse residencia ... Uelazquez, se congoxó\r\n     mucho mas, y como de antes era muy gordo, se paró flaco en\r\n     aquellos dias.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 38. Martin petitioned the\r\n     bishop for the repair and return of the messengers’ vessel\r\n     to Velazquez, together with another vessel, both to carry\r\n     reinforcements to the Indies. This was needed, partly to\r\n     prevent the possible conflict between Cortés’ party and\r\n     the expedition fitting out under Velazquez to support the\r\n     men he had already sent under Cortés as his lieutenant.\r\n     _Memorial_, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i. 407-9.\r\n\r\n     [249] _Sandoval_, _Hist. Carlos V._, i. 203. ‘Viniéronse\r\n     con la corte hasta llegar á la Coruña, y en este camino los\r\n     cognoscí yo.’ _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 499; _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. ix. cap. vii.\r\n\r\n     [250] In the Manual de la Casa de Contratacion de la Indias\r\n     is noted that the Cempoala natives were presented to the\r\n     king, at Tordesillas, in February, or March, 1520, and the\r\n     presents at Valladolid in April. The Indians were sent to\r\n     Cuba at the close of March, 1521, except one who had died.\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 34; _Alaman_, _Disert._, i. 91-104.\r\n\r\n     [251] According to Bernal Diaz the bishop of Búrgos retained\r\n     not only the original letters of the king, but a portion of\r\n     the presents, which produced a sharp letter from Charles.\r\n     The duplicate letters reached him, however. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     38-9. This author is not well informed about the movements\r\n     of the procuradores. He lets the king reach Flanders before\r\n     they arrive, and there receive only the reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE SINKING OF THE FLEET.\r\n\r\nJULY-AUGUST, 1519.\r\n\r\n     DIEGO VELAZQUEZ ONCE MORE—HIS SUPPORTERS IN THE CAMP OF\r\n     CORTÉS—THEY ATTEMPT ESCAPE—ARE DISCOVERED—THE LEADERS\r\n     ARE SEIZED AND EXECUTED—CORTÉS’ RIDE TO CEMPOALA, AND\r\n     WHAT CAME OF IT—HE DETERMINES ON THE DESTRUCTION OF\r\n     THE FLEET—PRELIMINARY STRATAGEMS—SEVERAL OF THE SHIPS\r\n     PRONOUNCED UNSEAWORTHY—THE MATTER BEFORE THE SOLDIERS—THE\r\n     FLEET SUNK—INDIGNATION OF THE VELAZQUEZ FACTION—ONE VESSEL\r\n     REMAINING—IT IS OFFERED TO ANY WISHING TO DESERT—IT IS\r\n     FINALLY SUNK—FRANCISCO DE GARAY’S PRETENSIONS—SEIZURE OF SOME\r\n     OF HIS MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the top of a fir-tree, which he curbed and then let spring,\r\nTheseus fastened the robber Sinis, who had been accustomed himself\r\nto kill travellers in that way. In a hollow brazen bull, which he\r\nhad made for the Sicilian tyrant to roast his victims in, Perillus\r\nthe inventor was roasted. A famous detective was hanged at last for\r\nhouse-breaking. Matthew Hopkins, the witch-finder, who about the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century travelled the country over to discover and\r\nbring witches to punishment, was finally, with pronounced effect,\r\nsubjected to one of his own tests. Witches, he had said, would not\r\nsink in water. This was a safe proposition for the prosecution; for\r\nif they sank they were drowned, and if they did not sink they were\r\nburned. Being at length himself charged with witchcraft, the people\r\nseized and threw him into a river; and as he floated, by his own law\r\nhe was declared a witch, and put to death accordingly. In more ways\r\nthan one, he who invents a guillotine is often the first to suffer\r\nby it. It is not wise to sow dragons’ teeth, and expect therefrom a\r\nhappy harvest.\r\n\r\nNow Diego Velazquez had all his life been sowing dragons’ teeth, and\r\nhunting witches, and building guillotines, and brazen bulls. Starting\r\nfrom Spain in the guise of a noble old soldier, as he advertised\r\nhimself, though some said of him that his sword was bloodless and\r\nhis bravery bravado, he served the usual apprenticeship in the New\r\nWorld, chasing, and mutilating, and murdering, and enslaving natives,\r\nworking to death on his plantations those saved for this most cruel\r\nfate. For this and similar service Diego Colon, then ruling the\r\nIndies at Española, sent him to Cuba to play governor there over\r\nthose inoffensive and thrice unlucky savages. Fraud being native\r\nto his character, no sooner was he fairly seated than he repudiated\r\nhis late master and benefactor, and reported directly to the king,\r\neven as his own captain of the Mexican expedition was now doing.\r\nAnother of his guillotines was the vile treatment of Grijalva for\r\nnot disobeying orders, on which score he could not complain against\r\nGrijalva’s successor. Yet, as head and heart frosted with time the\r\nCuban governor was not happy: misdeeds never bring true or lasting\r\nhappiness. His bitterness, however, was but in the bloom; the full\r\nfruit of his folly would come only after the consummation of events\r\nupon the continent, grand as yet beyond conception. Ordinarily it\r\nis much easier to kill a man than to create one; in this instance it\r\nwas extremely difficult to kill the man that he had made.\r\n\r\nIf among the New World cavaliers such a thing as poltroon or coward\r\ncould be, Diego Velazquez was that thing, notwithstanding he had\r\nparticipated in so much fighting. Yet I do not call him coward, for\r\nmy pen refuses to couple such a term with that of sixteenth-century\r\nSpaniard. Certain it is, however, that few men in those days preferred\r\nconquering new lands by deputy to winning glory in person, and if\r\nthis soldier and governor was not a coward, there was little of the\r\nmanly or chivalrous in his bravery. He was cautious, yet frequently\r\nhis cupidity overcame his caution; and when he adventured his gold—for\r\nhe seldom risked his life, either for fame which he dearly loved,\r\nor for gold which he loved still dearer—it was under restrictions\r\nruinous to almost any enterprise. In his ordinary mood he played\r\nfairly enough the statesman and hero, but in truth his statesmanship\r\nwas superficial, and his heroism theatrical. Las Casas calls him\r\na terrible fellow for those who served him, and Gomara says he had\r\nlittle stomach for expenditures. This much allowance, however, should\r\nbe made in any statements of historians respecting the governor of\r\nCuba: in their drama of the conquest Diego Velazquez plays the part\r\nof chief villain to the hero Hernan Cortés, when as a matter of fact\r\nCortés was the greater villain of the two, principally because he\r\nwas the stronger.\r\n\r\nEven the priests praise Cortés, though many of his acts were\r\ntreacherous; and timidity in a leader was accounted the most heinous\r\nof crimes. On the whole, I agree with Torquemada that the governor\r\nshould have gone against Montezuma in person, if it was necessary\r\nhe should go on such dastardly work at all; but we may be sure that\r\nVelazquez would not himself venture upon this sea of high exploit,\r\nthough Æolus with a silver cord had tied up the winds in an ox-hide,\r\nas he did for Ulysses. And now from this time forth, and indeed from\r\nthe moment the unrestrainable Estremaduran embarked defying him,\r\nthe sulphurous fire of hatred and revenge burned constant in the old\r\nman’s breast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNever was villainy so great that if united with high station or ability\r\nit could not find supporters; for most men are rascals at heart in\r\none direction or another. The pretty pair, Velazquez the governor,\r\nand Cortés the adventurer—so well pitted that the difference between\r\nthem consists chiefly in setting off the position of one against\r\nthe native strength of the other, the manners and pusillanimity of\r\nthe one against the fate-defying chivalry of the other—had each his\r\nactive workers not only in Spain, but in America, those of Velazquez\r\nbeing some of them in the very camp of Cortés. Since the royal grant\r\nof superior powers to Velazquez, this faction has lifted its head.\r\nAnd now its brain works.\r\n\r\nThe messengers for Spain had scarcely left the port before these\r\nmalcontents form a plot, this time not with the sole desire to return\r\nto a more comfortable and secure life, but with a view to advise\r\nVelazquez of the treasure ship so close at hand. Amongst them are\r\nto be found the priest Juan Diaz; Juan Escudero, the alguacil of\r\nBaracoa, who beguiled and surrendered Cortés into the hands of the\r\nauthorities; Diego Cermeño and Gonzalo de Umbría, pilots; Bernardino\r\nde Coria, and Alonso Peñate, beside several leading men who merely\r\ncountenanced the plot.[252] They have already secured a small vessel\r\nwith the necessary supplies, and the night of embarkment is at hand,\r\nwhen Coria repents and betrays his companions.\r\n\r\nCortés is profoundly moved. It is not so much the hot indignation\r\nthat stirs his breast against the traitors as the light from afar that\r\nseems to float in upon his mind like an inspiration, showing him more\r\nvividly than he had ever seen it before, his situation. So lately\r\na lax and frivolous youth, apparently of inept nature, wrought to\r\nstiffer consistency by some years of New World kneading, by a stroke\r\nof the rarest fortune he suddenly finds himself a commander of men,\r\nin a virgin field of enterprise fascinating beyond expression, and\r\noffering to the soldier possibilities excelled by nothing within the\r\ncentury. As the mind enlarges to take in these possibilities, the\r\nwhole being seems to enlarge with it, the unstable adventurer is a\r\nthing of the past, and behold a mighty rock fills the place. Against\r\nit heads shall beat unprofitably. The momentous question of to be or\r\nnot to be is forever determined; it is an affair simply of life now.\r\nLife and the power of which he finds himself possessed shall rise\r\nor fall together; and if his life, then the lives of others. No life\r\nshall be more precious to him than his own; no life shall be accounted\r\nprecious at all that stands in the way of his plans. To a lady who\r\ncomplained of the burning of the Palatinate by Turenne, Napoleon\r\nanswered: “And why not, madame, if it was necessary to his designs?”\r\nThe Palatinate! ay, and a hundred million souls flung into the same\r\nfire, ere the one omnipotent soul shall suffer the least abridgment.\r\nIt was a small matter, and he would do it; all the islands of the\r\nWestern Inde he would uproot and fling into the face of the Cuban\r\ngovernor before he would yield one jot of his stolen advantage. Each\r\nfor himself were Velazquez, Columbus, and Charles, and the rest of\r\nthis world’s great and little ones, and Cortés would be for himself.\r\nHenceforth, like Themistocles, though he would die for his country he\r\nwould not trust her. Return to Cuba he well knew for him was death,\r\nor ignominy worse than death. His only way was toward Mexico. As\r\nwell first as last. All the past life of Cortés, all his purposes\r\nfor the future, concentred in these resolves to make them the pivot\r\nof his destiny. Cortés, master of kings, arbiter of men’s lives! As\r\nfor these traitors, they shall die; and if other impediments appear,\r\nas presently we shall see them appear, be they in the form of eye or\r\nright hand, they shall be removed. Tyrant, he might be branded; ay,\r\nas well that as another name, for so are great ends often brought to\r\npass by small means. Unpleasant as it may be, the survivors may as\r\nwell bear in mind that it will be less difficult another time.\r\n\r\nSo the conspirators are promptly seized and sentenced, Escudero and\r\nCermeño to be hanged, Umbría to lose his feet, and others to receive\r\neach two hundred lashes.[253] Under cover of his cloth Padre Diaz,\r\nthe ringleader and most guilty of them all, escapes with a reprimand.\r\nAs for the rest, though among them were some equally guilty, they\r\nwere treated with such dissembling courtesy and prudence as either\r\nto render them harmless or to convert them into friends. “Happy the\r\nman who cannot write, if it save him from such business as this!”\r\nexclaimed the commander, as he affixed his name to the death-warrants.\r\nFor notwithstanding his inexorable resolve he was troubled, and would\r\nnot see his comrades die though they would have sacrificed him. On\r\nthe morning of the day of execution he set off at breakneck speed\r\nfor Cempoala, after ordering two hundred soldiers to follow with\r\nthe horses and join a similar force which had left three days before\r\nunder Alvarado.[254]\r\n\r\nCortés’ brain was in a whirl during that ride. It was a horrible\r\nthing, this hanging of Spaniards, cutting off feet, and flogging.\r\nViewed in one light it was but a common piece of military discipline;\r\nfrom another stand-point it was the act of an outlaw. The greater\r\npart of the little army was with the commander; to this full extent\r\nthe men believed in him, that on his valor and discretion they would\r\nadventure their lives. With most men beliefs are but prejudices, and\r\nopinions tastes. These Spaniards not only believed in their general,\r\nbut they held to a most impetuous belief in themselves. They could\r\ndo not only anything that any one else ever had done or could do,\r\nbut they could command the supernatural, and fight with or against\r\nphantoms and devils. They were a host in themselves; besides which\r\nthe hosts of Jehovah were on their side. And Cortés measured his men\r\nand their capabilities, not as Xerxes measured his army, by filling\r\nsuccessively a pen capable of holding just ten thousand; he measured\r\nthem rather by his ambition, which was as bright and as limitless as\r\nthe firmament. Already they were heroes, whose story presently should\r\nvie in thrilling interest with the most romantic tales of chivalry\r\nand knight-errantry, and in whom the strongest human passions were so\r\nblended as to lift them for a time out of the hand of fate and make\r\ntheir fortunes their own. The thirst for wealth, the enthusiasm of\r\nreligion, the love of glory, united with reckless daring and excessive\r\nloyalty, formed the most powerful incentives to action. Life to them\r\nwithout the attainment of their object was valueless; they would do or\r\ndie; for to die in doing was life, whereas to live failing was worse\r\nthan death. Cortés felt all this, though it scarcely lay on his mind\r\nin threads of tangible thought. There was enough however that was\r\ntangible in his thinkings, and exceedingly troubling. Unfortunately\r\nthe mind and heart of all his people were not of the complexion he\r\nwould have them. And those ships. And the disaffected men lying so\r\nnear them, looking wistfully at them every morning, and plotting,\r\nand plotting all the day long. Like the Palatinate to Turenne, like\r\nanything that seduced from the stern purposes of Cortés, it were\r\nbetter they were not.\r\n\r\nThis thought once flashed into his mind fastened itself there. And\r\nit grew. And Cortés grew with it, until the man and the idea filled\r\nall that country, and became the wonder and admiration of the world.\r\nDestroy the ships! Cut off all escape, should such be needed in case of\r\nfailure! Burn the bridge that spans time, and bring to his desperate\r\ndesire the aid of the eternities! The thought of it alone was daring;\r\nmore fearfully fascinating it became as Cortés dashed along toward\r\nCempoala, and by the time he had reached his destination the thing\r\nwas determined, and he might with Cæsar at the Rubicon exclaim, _Jacta\r\nest alea_! But what would his soldiers say? They must be made to feel\r\nas he feels, to see with his eyes, and to swell with his ambition.\r\n\r\nThe confession of the conspirators opened the eyes of Cortés to a fact\r\nwhich surely he had seen often enough before, though by reason of his\r\ngenerous nature which forgot an injury immediately it was forgiven, it\r\nhad not been much in his mind of late, namely, that too many of his\r\ncompanions were lukewarm, if not openly disaffected. They could not\r\nforget that Cortés was a common man like themselves, their superior in\r\nname only, and placed over them for the accomplishment of this single\r\npurpose. They felt they had a right to say whether they would remain\r\nand take the desperate chance their leader seemed determined on, and\r\nto act on that right with or without his consent. And their position\r\nassuredly was sound; whether it was sensible depended greatly on\r\ntheir ability to sustain themselves in it. Cortés was exercising the\r\narbitrary power of a majority to drive the minority as it appeared to\r\ntheir death. They had a perfect right to rebel; they had not entered\r\nthe service under any such compact. Cortés himself was a rebel; hence\r\nthe rebellion of the Velazquez men, being a rebelling against a rebel,\r\nwas in truth an adherence to loyalty. Here as everywhere it was might\r\nthat made right; and, indeed, with the right of these matters the\r\nnarrator has little to do.\r\n\r\nSuccess, shame, fear, bright prospects, had all lent their aid to\r\nhold the discontented in check, but in these several regards feeling\r\nand opinion were subject to daily fluctuations. Let serious danger\r\nor reverses come, and they would flee in a moment if they could.\r\nAnd the fleet lying so near was a constant temptation. Cut that\r\noff, and the nerves of every man there would be freshly strung.\r\nThe meanest would suddenly become charged with a kind of nobility;\r\nthey would at once become inspired with the courage that comes from\r\ndesperation. Often those least inclined to fight when forced to it\r\nare the most indifferent to death. Other dormant elements would be\r\nbrought out by the disappearance of those ships; union, fraternity,\r\ncomplete community, not only of interest but of life. Their leader\r\nwith multiplied power would become their god. On him they would be\r\ndependent for all things; for food and raiment, for riches, glory,\r\nand every success; for life itself. Cortés saw all this, pondered\r\nit well, and thought it would be very pretty to play the god awhile.\r\nHe would much prefer it to confinement in old Velazquez’ plaza-pen,\r\nor even in a Seville prison. Cortés was now certain in his own mind\r\nthat if his band remained unbroken either by internal dissension\r\nor by white men yet to arrive, he would tread the streets of the\r\nMexican capital before he entered the gates of the celestial city.\r\nIf Montezuma would not admit him peaceably, he would gather such a\r\nforce of the emperor’s enemies as would pull the kingdom down about\r\nhis ears. It would be necessary on going inland to leave a garrison\r\nat Villa Rica; but it would be madness to leave also vessels in which\r\nthey could sail away to Cuba or elsewhere. And finally, if the ships\r\nwere destroyed, the sailors, who otherwise would be required to care\r\nfor them, might be added to the army. Such were the arguments which\r\nthe commander would use to win the consent of his people to one of\r\nthe most desperate and daring acts ever conceived by a strategist of\r\nany age or nation.\r\n\r\nNot that such consent was necessary. He might destroy the ships and\r\nsettle with the soldiers afterward. The deed accomplished, with or\r\nwithout their consent, there would be but one course open to them.\r\nNevertheless he preferred they should think themselves the authors\r\nof it rather than feel that they had been tricked, or in any way\r\nunfairly dealt with. And with the moral he would shift the pecuniary\r\nresponsibility to their shoulders. So he went to work as usual, with\r\ninstruments apparently independent, but whose every step and word\r\nwere of his directing. One day quickly thereafter it came to pass\r\nthat the masters of several of the largest ships appeared before\r\nthe captain-general with lengthened faces well put on, with the sad\r\nintelligence that their respective craft were unseaworthy; indeed one\r\nof them had sunk already. They did not say they had secretly bored\r\nholes in them according to instructions. Cortés was surprised, nay\r\nhe was painfully affected; Roscius himself could not have performed\r\nthe part better; “for well he could dissemble when it served his\r\npurpose,” chimes in Las Casas. With Christian fortitude he said:\r\n“Well, the will of God be done; but look you sharply to the other\r\nships.” Barnacles were then freely discussed, and teredos. And so\r\nwell obeyed the mariners their instructions that soon they were\r\nable to swear that all the vessels save three were unsafe, and even\r\nthese required costly repairs before they would be seaworthy.[255]\r\nThus as by the hand of providence, to the minds of the men as they\r\nwere able to bear it, the deed unfolded. Soon quite apparent became\r\nthe expediency of abandoning such vessels as were leaking badly;\r\nthere was trouble and no profit in attempting to maintain them,\r\nfor they would surely have to be abandoned in the end. “And indeed,\r\nfellow-soldiers,” continued Cortés, “I am not sure but it were best\r\nto doom to destruction also the others, and so secure the coöperation\r\nof the sailors in the coming campaign, instead of leaving them in\r\nidleness to hatch fresh treachery.” This intimation was successful,\r\nas had been foreordained by the ruler of these events it should be.\r\nIt was forthwith resolved to scuttle all the ships but one, the one\r\nbrought by Salcedo. Accordingly Escalante, the alguacil mayor, a brave\r\nand able officer wholly devoted to Cortés, was sent down to Villa\r\nRica to carry out the order, with the aid of the picked soldiers\r\nthere stationed. Sails, anchors, cables, and everything that could\r\nbe utilized were removed, and a few hours later some small boats were\r\nall that remained of the Cuban fleet.[256]\r\n\r\nIt was then the community first realized its situation. The followers\r\nof Cortés, with unbounded faith in their leader, did not so much care,\r\nbut the partisans of Velazquez, few of whom knew that the affair had\r\nbeen coolly predetermined, were somewhat agitated. And when on closer\r\ninquiry they were enlightened by certain of the mariners, the cry\r\narose that they were betrayed; they were lambs led to the slaughter.\r\nCortés promptly faced the now furious crowd. What did they want? Were\r\ntheir lives more precious than those of the rest? “For shame! Be men!”\r\nhe cried, in conclusion. “You should know ere this how vain are the\r\nattempts to thwart my purpose. Look on this magnificent land with\r\nits vast treasures, and narrow not your vision to your insignificant\r\nselves. Think of your glorious reward, present and to come, and trust\r\nin God, who, if it so please him, can conquer this empire with a single\r\narm. Yet if there be one here still so craven as to wish to turn his\r\nback on the glories and advantages thus offered; if there be one here\r\nso base, so recreant to heaven, to his king, to his comrades, as to\r\nslink from such honorable duty, in God’s name let him go. There is\r\none ship left, which I will equip at my own charge to give that man\r\nthe immortal infamy he deserves.” This he said and much more, and\r\nto the desired effect. The speaker knew well how to play upon his\r\nmen, as on an instrument, so that they would respond in any tune he\r\npleased. Cheers rent the air as he concluded, in which the opposition\r\nwere forced to join through very shame. Seeing which Cortés gently\r\nintimated, “Would it not be well to destroy the remaining vessel, and\r\nso make a safe, clean thing of it?” In the enthusiasm of the moment\r\nthe act was consummated with hearty approval.[257]\r\n\r\n“To Mexico!” was now the cry, and preparations for the march were at\r\nonce made. Escalante, whose character and services had endeared him\r\nto Cortés, was placed in command of Villa Rica. The native chiefs\r\nwere directed to regard him as the representative of the general,\r\nand to supply him with every requirement.[258]\r\n\r\nSome nine days after the sinking of the fleet a messenger arrived\r\nfrom Escalante, announcing that four vessels[259] had passed by the\r\nharbor, refusing to enter, and had anchored three leagues off, at\r\nthe mouth of a river. Fearing the descent upon him of Velazquez,\r\nCortés hurried off with four horsemen, after selecting fifty soldiers\r\nto follow. Alvarado and Sandoval were left jointly in charge of the\r\narmy, to the exclusion of Ávila, who manifested no little jealousy of\r\nthe latter. Cortés halted at the town merely to learn particulars,\r\ndeclining Escalante’s hospitality with the proverb, “A lame goat\r\nhas no rest.” On the way to the vessels they met a notary with two\r\nwitnesses,[260] commissioned to arrange a boundary on behalf of\r\nFrancisco de Garay, who claimed the coast to the north as first\r\ndiscoverer, and desired to form a settlement a little beyond Nautla.\r\nIt appeared that Garay, who had come out with Diego Colon, and had\r\nrisen from procurador of Española to become governor of Jamaica, had\r\nresolved to devote his great wealth to extending his fame as explorer\r\nand colonizer. On learning from Alaminos and his fellow voyagers of\r\nthe coasts discovered in this direction, he resolved to revive the\r\nfamed projects of Ponce de Leon, and with this view despatched a\r\nsmall fleet in 1518, under Diego de Camargo.[261] Driven back by the\r\nFloridans with great slaughter, says Gomara, the expedition sailed\r\ndown to Pánuco River, again to be repulsed, with the loss of some\r\nmen, who were flayed and eaten. Torralba, steward of Garay, was then\r\nsent to Spain, and there, with the aid of Garay’s friends, obtained\r\nfor him a commission as adelantado and governor of the territories\r\nthat he might discover north of Rio San Pedro y San Pablo.[262]\r\nMeanwhile a new expedition was despatched to Pánuco, under Alonso\r\nÁlvarez Pineda, to form a settlement and to barter for gold. After\r\nobtaining some three thousand pesos, Pineda sailed southward to take\r\npossession and to select a site for the colony.[263]\r\n\r\nAnd now while the notary is endeavoring to arrange matters with\r\nCortés, Pineda waits for him a little distance from the shore. At\r\nthat moment Cortés cared little for Garays or boundaries; but he\r\nwould by no means object to a few more Spaniards to take the place\r\nof those he had hanged, and of others whom he might yet be obliged\r\nto hang. To this end he converted perforce to his cause the notary\r\nand his attendants. Then learning from them that Pineda could on no\r\naccount be prevailed on to land for a conference, Cortés signalled\r\nto the vessels with the hope that more men would come on shore. This\r\nfailing, he bethought himself of letting three of his men exchange\r\nclothes with the new-comers and approach the landing, while he marched\r\nback with the rest in full view of the vessels. As soon as it grew\r\ndark, the whole force returned to hide near the spot. It was not till\r\nlate the following morning that the suspicious Pineda responded to\r\nthe signals from shore, and sent off a boat with armed men. The trio\r\nnow withdrew behind some bushes, as if for shade. Four Spaniards and\r\none Indian landed, armed with two firelocks and two cross-bows, and\r\non reaching the shrubbery they were pounced upon by the hidden force,\r\nwhile the boat pushed off to join the vessels all ready to sail.[264]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [252] The names vary somewhat in different authorities,\r\n     Bernal Diaz including instead of Peñate, a number of the\r\n     Gibraltar sailors known as Peñates, who were lashed at\r\n     Cozumel for theft. The plot was hatched ‘Desde â quatro dias\r\n     que partieron nuestros Procuradores.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 39.\r\n     Cortés mentions only four ‘determinado de tomar un bergantin\r\n     ... y matar al maestre dél, y irse á la isla Fernandina.’\r\n     _Cartas_, 53-4. Gomara assumes them to be the same who last\r\n     revolted on setting out for Tizapantzinco. _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     64. ‘Pusieron ... por obra de hurtar un navío pequeño,\r\n     é salir á robar lo que llevaban para el rey.’ _Tapia_,\r\n     _Relacion_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 563. Peter\r\n     Martyr jumbles the names, dec. v. cap. i.\r\n\r\n     [253] Thus Cortés had his revenge on the alguacil. ‘Y no\r\n     le valiò el ser su Compadre,’ says Vetancvrt, with a hasty\r\n     assumption which is not uncommon with him. _Teatro Mex._,\r\n     pt. iii. 119. Gomara mentions no mutilation. ‘Parece claro\r\n     ser aquestas obras, ... propias de averiguado tirano,’ says\r\n     Las Casas, _Hist. Ind._, iv. 496, which may be regarded as\r\n     a singularly mild expression for the bishop. Herrera dwells\r\n     upon Cermeño’s extraordinary skill with the leaping-pole;\r\n     he could also smell land fifteen leagues off the coast,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. v. cap. xiv. ‘Coria, vezino que fue despues\r\n     de Chiapa.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 39.\r\n\r\n     [254] ‘Embiado ... por los pueblos de la sierra, porque\r\n     tuuiessen que comer; porque en nuestra Villa passauamos\r\n     mucha necessidad de bastimentos.’ _Id._ This seems unlikely,\r\n     since the Totonacs were not only willing, but bound, to\r\n     provide supplies.\r\n\r\n     [255] _Testimonio de Montejo y Puertocarrero_, in _Col.\r\n     Doc. Inéd._, i. 489, 494. ‘Viniesen á él, cuando estuviese\r\n     mucha gente con él junta, y le denunciasen como no podian\r\n     vencer el agua de los navíos.’ _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     iv. 497. ‘Tuuo forma para que los soldados mas aficionados\r\n     que tenia se lo pidiessen.... Los soldados se lo pidieron,\r\n     y dello se recibio auto por ante escriuano.’ _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. v. cap. xiv. ‘Le aconsejamos los que eramos\r\n     sus amigos, que no dexasse Nauio en el Puerto.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 39.\r\n\r\n     [256] ‘Los Pilotos, ê Maestres viejos, y marineros, que\r\n     no erã buenos para ir â la guerra, que se quedassen en la\r\n     Villa, y cõ dos chinchorros que tuuiessen cargo de pescar\r\n     ... y luego se vino (Escalante) â Cempoal con vna Capitania\r\n     de hombres de la mar, que fuessen los que sacaron de los\r\n     Nauios, y salieron algunos dellos muy buenos soldados.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 40.\r\n\r\n     [257] It is generally admitted that Cortés suggested the\r\n     idea of destroying the fleet, for even Bernal Diaz, who at\r\n     first gives the credit to the men by saying, ‘le aconsejamos\r\n     los que eramos sus amigos,’ confesses on the following\r\n     page that ‘el mismo Cortès lo tenia ya concertado.’ _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 39-40. The preponderating testimony also shows\r\n     that the masters made their report in public, with the\r\n     evident object, as the best authorities clearly indicate,\r\n     of obtaining the consent of the responsible majority for\r\n     the scuttling. During the partition of treasures at Mexico,\r\n     large shares were set aside for Cortés and Velazquez to\r\n     cover the cost of the fleet and the outfit, ‘que dimos\r\n     al traues con ellos, pues todos fuimos en ellos,’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 84, which is proof, in addition to\r\n     the reliable assertion that the deed was agreed upon by\r\n     the majority. Cortés’ expression, ‘los eché á la costa,’\r\n     _Cartas_, 54, is merely that of a leader of that party or\r\n     majority, who besides really gives credit to others. Hence\r\n     the conclusion of Prescott and others, that the scuttling\r\n     was done on his own responsibility, is not well founded.\r\n     Cortés was clever enough always to have those present who\r\n     were ready to take any responsibility for him that he might\r\n     wish. The phrase, ‘his was the greatest sacrifice, for they\r\n     (the vessels) were his property,’ _Prescott’s Mex._, i. 374,\r\n     is also wrong, for he was compensated by the army. And it\r\n     is an exaggeration to say that the execution of the measure\r\n     ‘in the face of an incensed and desperate soldiery, was\r\n     an act of resolution that has few parallels in history,’\r\n     _Id._, 376, since his party supported him. According to\r\n     Gomara the pilots bore holes in the vessels, and bring\r\n     their report, whereupon five vessels are first sunk; shortly\r\n     afterward the remainder except one are scuttled. The offer\r\n     of this vessel to those who wished to return was made with\r\n     a view to learn who were the cowards and malcontents. Many\r\n     indeed did ask for leave, but half of them were sailors.\r\n     Others kept quiet out of shame. _Hist. Mex._, 65. It was\r\n     never Cortés’ policy to mark the disaffected, however.\r\n     This author is followed by Torquemada, ‘porque asi se ha\r\n     platicado siempre entre las Gentes, que mas supieron de esta\r\n     Jornada,’ i. 409, and on the strength of this the latter\r\n     argues that Herrera’s version, dec. ii. lib. v. cap. xiv.,\r\n     which adheres chiefly to Bernal Diaz’, must be wrong. Tapia,\r\n     _Relacion_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 563, conforms\r\n     chiefly to Gomara. Robertson, after following Bernal Diaz,\r\n     takes the trouble of having the ships ‘drawn ashore and\r\n     ... broke in pieces.’ _Hist. Am._, ii. 33-4; _Clavigero_,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 35-6; _Oviedo_, _Hist. Gen._, iii.\r\n     262; _Sandoval_, _Hist. Carlos V._, i. 171; _Peter Martyr_,\r\n     dec. v. cap. i. Peralta has them burned by secret agents\r\n     of Cortés. _Nat. Hist._, 76. Solis, ever zealous for his\r\n     hero, objects to Bernal Diaz’ attempt to pluck any of the\r\n     glory, and scouts the idea that fears of pecuniary liability\r\n     could have influenced Cortés to gain the approval of others\r\n     for his act. ‘Tuvo á destreza de historiador el penetrar\r\n     lo interior de las acciones,’ is the complacent tribute to\r\n     his own skill in penetrating the question. _Hist. Mex._, i.\r\n     214-15. The view of the foundering fleet, appended to some\r\n     editions of his work, has been extensively copied. One is\r\n     given in the Antwerp edition of 1704, 141. A still finer\r\n     view, with the men busy on shore, and the sinking vessels in\r\n     the distance, is to be found in the Madrid issue of 1783,\r\n     i. 213. The destruction of the fleet has been lauded in\r\n     extravagant terms by almost every authority, from Gomara\r\n     and Solis to Robertson and Prescott, as an unparalleled\r\n     deed. Of previous examples there are enough, however, even\r\n     though the motives and the means differ. We may go back to\r\n     Æneas, to whose fleet the wives of the party applied the\r\n     torch, tired of roaming; or we may point to Agathocles,\r\n     who first fired his soldiers with a resolution to conquer\r\n     or to die, and then compelled them to keep their word by\r\n     firing the vessels. Julian offered a tamer instance during\r\n     his campaign on the Tigris; but the deed of the terrible\r\n     Barbarossa in the Mediterranean, only a few years before\r\n     the Mexican campaign, was marked by reckless determination.\r\n     Still examples little affect the greatness of an act;\r\n     motives, means, and results afford the criteria. ‘Pocos\r\n     exemplos destos ay, y aquellos son de grandes hombres.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 65. ‘Una de las acciones en que mas\r\n     se reconoce la grandeza de su ánimo.... Y no sabemos si de\r\n     su género se hallará mayor alguna en todo el campo de las\r\n     Historias.’ _Solis_, _Hist. Mex._, i. 213. ‘An effort of\r\n     magnanimity, to which there is nothing parallel in history.’\r\n     _Robertson_, _Hist. Am._, ii. 34. ‘Un’impresa, che da per\r\n     se sola basterebbe a far conoscere la sua magnanimità, e ad\r\n     immortalare il suo nome.’ _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii.\r\n     35; Prescott, _Mex._, i. 375-6, is equally carried away,\r\n     and he finds more words for his admiration. He is wrong in\r\n     supposing that one of the vessels in the harbor was left\r\n     intact; the exempt ship referred to by a chronicler was\r\n     the one carrying the messengers to Spain.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Antonio de Solis y Ribadeneyra is remarkable as the first\r\n     Spanish historian of the conquest. It appears to us strange\r\n     that an episode so glorious to the fame of Castilians\r\n     should have been allowed to lie so long neglected in the\r\n     musty pages of their chroniclers. True, these were worthy,\r\n     zealous men, who conscientiously narrated every occurrence\r\n     of any note, but their standard for historic truth and\r\n     dignity caused them to clothe facts, however striking, in\r\n     a garb of dreary gravity, dryness of detail, and ambiguous\r\n     confusion, which discouraged even the student. It required\r\n     the dramatic eye of the composer and the imagination\r\n     of the poet to appreciate the picturesque sketches of a\r\n     strange people now fading into oblivion, the grandeur of a\r\n     semi-savage pageantry, the romantic exploits that recalled\r\n     the achievements of the Cid. This faculty was innate in\r\n     Solis, developed besides by a long and successful career in\r\n     letters. He had profited also by the advantages opened to\r\n     him as the secretary of Conde de Oropesa, Viceroy of Navarre\r\n     and of Valencia, who Mæcenas-like fostered the talents and\r\n     aided in the promotion of the promising savant, for as such\r\n     he already ranked. Cradled in the famous college town of\r\n     Alcalá de Henares, he had given early evidence of talent,\r\n     and at Salamanca university he had signalized himself in\r\n     his seventeenth year by producing a comedy of considerable\r\n     merit. While pursuing with energy the study of law and moral\r\n     philosophy, he cultivated with hardly less ardor the muses,\r\n     to which end he was no doubt impelled also by his intimacy\r\n     with the illustrious Calderon. Several of his dramas were\r\n     received with acclamation, and one was translated into\r\n     French, while his miscellaneous poems, reprinted in our\r\n     days, are marked by a vivid imagination and an elegance\r\n     which also adorns his letters. Talents so conspicuous did\r\n     not wait long for recognition, and with the aid of his\r\n     patron he advanced to the dignities of royal secretary and\r\n     chief chronicler of the Indies. When 56 years old his mind\r\n     underwent a change, and entering the church he abandoned\r\n     forever the drama and light literature. The pen changed\r\n     only its sphere, however, for it served the historiographer\r\n     zealously, achieving for him the greatest fame; and fame\r\n     alone, for at his death, in April, 1686, at the age of 76,\r\n     deep poverty was his companion. When he entered on this\r\n     office the Indies had lapsed into the dormant quietude\r\n     imposed by a strict and secluding colonial régime. There\r\n     were no stirring incidents to reward the efforts of the\r\n     historian, save those connected with free-booter raids,\r\n     which offered little that could flatter Spanish pride. To\r\n     achieve fame he must take up some old theme, and present\r\n     it in a form likely to rouse attention by its contrast.\r\n     Thus it was that he selected the thrilling episode of the\r\n     conquest of Mexico, with the determination to rescue it\r\n     from the unskilful arrangement and repetitions, the want of\r\n     harmony and consistency, the dryness and faulty coloring,\r\n     to which it had hitherto been subjected, and to expend\r\n     upon it the effects of elegant style and vast erudition.\r\n     When the work appeared at Madrid, in 1684, its superior\r\n     merits were instantly recognized, and although the sale\r\n     at first was not large, editions have multiplied till our\r\n     day, the finest and costliest being the illustrated issue\r\n     of 1783-4, in two volumes, which I quote, while consulting\r\n     also the notes of several others. So grand and finely\r\n     elaborated a subject, and that from a Spanish historian who\r\n     was supposed to have exhausted all the available resources\r\n     of the Iberian archives, could not fail to rouse general\r\n     attention throughout Europe, and translations were made\r\n     into different languages. Robertson, among others, while\r\n     not failing to point out certain blemishes, has paid the\r\n     high compliment of accepting Solis for almost sole guide\r\n     on the conquest, and this with a blindness which at times\r\n     leads him into most amusing errors. Even Prescott warms to\r\n     his theme in a review of six closely printed pages, wherein\r\n     eulogy, though not unmingled with censure, is stronger than\r\n     a clearer comprehension of the theme would seem to warrant.\r\n     But in this he is impelled to a great extent by his oft\r\n     displayed tendency to hero worship.\r\n\r\n     Solis deserves acknowledgment for bringing order out of\r\n     chaos, for presenting in a connected form the narrative of\r\n     the conquest, and for adorning it with an elegant style.\r\n     But he has fulfilled only a part of the promises made\r\n     in his preface, and above all has he neglected to obtain\r\n     information on his topic beyond that presented in a few\r\n     of the generally accessible works, even their evidence\r\n     being not very closely examined. He has also taken great\r\n     liberties with the text, subordinating facts to style and\r\n     fancy, seizing every possible opportunity to manufacture\r\n     speeches for both native and Spanish heroes, and this with\r\n     an amusing disregard for the consistency of language with\r\n     the person and the time. His religious tendencies seriously\r\n     interfere with calm judgment, and impel him to rave with\r\n     bigoted zeal against the natives. The hero worship of the\r\n     dramatist introduces itself to such an extent as frequently\r\n     to overshadow everything else, and to misrepresent. ‘Sembra\r\n     più un panegirico, che una istoria,’ says Clavigero, very\r\n     aptly. _Storia Mess._, i. 16. His arguments and deductions\r\n     are at times most childish, while his estimation of himself\r\n     as a historian and thinker is aired in more than one place\r\n     with a ridiculous gravity. With regard to style, Solis\r\n     had Livy for a model, and belonged to the elder school of\r\n     historians; he was its last good representative, in fact.\r\n     His language is expressive and elegant, greatly imbued with\r\n     a poetic spirit not unsuited to the subject, and sustained\r\n     in eloquence, while its pure idiom aids to maintain the\r\n     work as classic among Castilians. ‘Ingenio Conceptuoso,\r\n     Floridisimo, i Eloquente,’ is the observation in the work\r\n     of his historiographic predecessor, Pinelo, _Epitome_, ii.\r\n     607. But it lacks in boldness and dignity; the rhapsodies\r\n     are often misplaced, and the verboseness is tiresome. Some\r\n     of the faults are of course due to the time, but not the\r\n     many, and it also becomes only too apparent that Solis is\r\n     so conceitedly infatuated with his affected grandiloquence\r\n     as to sacrifice facts wherever they interfere with its\r\n     free scope. It is said that he intended to continue the\r\n     history of Mexico after the conquest, and that death alone\r\n     prevented the consummation of the project. But this is\r\n     mere conjecture, and it appears just as likely that the\r\n     dramatist recognized the effect of closing a great work\r\n     at so appropriate a point as the fall of Mexico. The work\r\n     was taken up, however, by Salazar y Olarte, who published\r\n     in 1743 the second part of the _Conquest_, till the death\r\n     of Cortés, abounding in all the faults of the superficial\r\n     and florid composition of Solis.\r\n\r\n     [258] ‘Luego le zahumaron [the chiefs] al Juan de Escalante\r\n     con sus inciensos.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 40. ‘Dejé\r\n     en la villa de la Veracruz ciento y cincuenta hombres con\r\n     doze de caballo.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 52-3. One hundred and\r\n     fifty Spaniards, with two horses and two fire-arms, were\r\n     left here under Pedro de Ircio, _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     65-6, but Bernal Diaz corrects him. ‘Al Pedro de Ircio no\r\n     le auian dado cargo ninguno, ni aun de cuadrillero.’ ubi\r\n     sup.; _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 291. The force seems\r\n     to be altogether too large. Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     51, says 60 old and suffering soldiers were left as garrison.\r\n\r\n     [259] Bernal Diaz says one vessel; but Cortés and other\r\n     authorities mention four.\r\n\r\n     [260] Bernal Diaz, who appears to have been with the party,\r\n     names them as Guillen de la Loa, notary; Andrés Nuñez,\r\n     shipwright; Pedro de la Arpa, a Valencian, and a fourth\r\n     man. _Hist. Verdad._, 40.\r\n\r\n     [261] ‘Armo Francisco de Garay tres carauelas en Iamaica,\r\n     el año de mil quiniẽtos y deziocho, y fue a tentar la\r\n     Florida.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Ind._, 55. ‘Determinó de enviar\r\n     á un hidalgo, llamado Diego de Camargo, á descubrir é\r\n     continuar el descubrimiento que Grijalva habia hecho, con\r\n     uno ó con dos navios; el cual descubrió la provincia de\r\n     Panuco, ó, por mejor decir, comenzó de allí donde Grijalva\r\n     se habia tornado, que fué desde Panuco, y anduvo navegando\r\n     por la costa cien leguas hácia la Florida.’ _Las Casas_,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, iv. 466; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. iii. cap.\r\n     xi.; _Galvano’s Discov._, 133-4.\r\n\r\n     [262] See _Hist. Mex._, i. 29, this series. ‘El Rey se\r\n     las concedió el año de 819, estando en Barcelona.’ _Las\r\n     Casas_, loc. cit. ‘Torralua ... truxo prouisiones para que\r\n     fuesse Adelantado, y Gouernador desde el rio de San Pedro,\r\n     y San Pablo, y todo lo que descubriesse: y por aquellas\r\n     prouisiones embiò luego tres Nauios con hasta dozientos y\r\n     setenta soldados.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 41.\r\n\r\n     [263] Bernal Diaz intimates that Pineda had remained at\r\n     Rio Pánuco to colonize, while one vessel was sent down to\r\n     take possession where Cortés met the men. After giving an\r\n     account of two expeditions in 1518 and 1519, Gomara says:\r\n     ‘Otros dizen, que no fue mas de vna vez. Sino que como\r\n     estuuo mucho alla cuẽtan por dos.’ _Hist. Ind._, 55. But\r\n     Las Casas mentions distinctly that it was on the strength of\r\n     Camargo’s discoveries, in 1518, that the grant was made to\r\n     Garay in the following year, ubi sup. ‘Garai auia corrido\r\n     mucha costa en demãda de la Florida, y tocado en vn rio\r\n     y tierra, cuyo rey se llamaua Panuco, donde vieron oro,\r\n     aun que poco. Y que sin salir de las naues auiã rescatado\r\n     hasta tres mil pesos de oro.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 67;\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 56-7; _Oviedo_, iii. 262-3; _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. vi. cap. i.\r\n\r\n     [264] ‘El uno(of the captured ones) era maestre de la una\r\n     nao, é puso fuego á la escopeta, é matara al capitan de la\r\n     Veracruz, sino que á la mecha le faltó el fuego.’ _Oviedo_,\r\n     iii. 263. Bernal Diaz, in a less intelligent account of\r\n     the capture, states that only two men landed. ‘Por manera\r\n     que se huuieron de aquel Nauio seis soldados.... Y esto es\r\n     lo que se hizo, y no lo que escriue el Coronista Gomara.’\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 41. But Cortés’ version must surely be the\r\n     best, since it was related shortly after the occurrence,\r\n     and by an immediate participator in the events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMARCH TOWARD MEXICO.\r\n\r\nAUGUST-SEPTEMBER, 1519.\r\n\r\n     ENTHUSIASM OF THE ARMY—THE FORCE—THE TOTONACS ADVISE THE\r\n     TLASCALAN ROUTE—ARRIVAL AT JALAPA—A LOOK BACKWARD—THE ANÁHUAC\r\n     PLATEAU—MEETING WITH OLINTETL—ARRIVAL IN THE COUNTRY OF THE\r\n     TLASCALTECS—THE SENATE CONVENES AND RECEIVES THE ENVOYS\r\n     OF CORTÉS—AN ENCOUNTER—A MORE SERIOUS BATTLE—XICOTENCATL\r\n     RESOLVES TO TRY THE PROWESS OF THE INVADERS, AND IS DEFEATED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garay affair having thus been disposed of, it was announced to the\r\nSpaniards that they would now go in quest of the great Montezuma. For\r\nas the conciliating sea smooths the sand which but lately it ground\r\nin its determinate purpose from the rocks, so had Cortés quieted\r\nthe ruffled temper of the malcontents, till they were committed as\r\none man to the will of the leader. And he smiled somewhat grimly as\r\nhe concluded his harangue: “To success or total destruction now we\r\nmarch; for there is open to us no retreat. In Christ we trust, and\r\non our arms rely. And though few in number, our hearts are strong.”\r\nThe soldiers shouted their approval, and again signified their desire\r\nto press onward to Mexico.[265]\r\n\r\nThe force for the expedition consisted of about four hundred and fifty\r\nSpaniards, with fifteen horses, and six or seven light guns, attended\r\nby a considerable number of Indian warriors and carriers, including\r\nCubans. The Totonac force comprised also forty chiefs, taken really\r\nas hostages, among whom are named Mamexi, Tamalli, and Teuch, the\r\nlatter proving a most able and trusty guide and counsellor.[266]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe advice of the Totonacs is to take the route through Tlascala,\r\nas a state friendly to them and bitterly opposed to the Mexicans,\r\nand on the 16th of August the army leaves Cempoala for the interior.\r\nSoon begins the gentle ascent which lifts them from oppressive heat\r\nand overpowering vegetation to cooler regions, and at the close of\r\nthe second day is reached the beautiful Jalapa,[267] a halting-place\r\nbetween the border of the sea and the upper plateau.\r\n\r\nThere they turn with one accord and look back. How charming! how\r\ninexpressibly refreshing are these approaching highlands to the\r\nSpaniards, so lately from the malarious Isthmus and the jungle-covered\r\nisles, and whose ancestors not long since had held all tropics to be\r\nuninhabitable; on the border, too, of Montezuma’s kingdom, wrapped in\r\nthe soft folds of perpetual spring. Before the invaders are the ardent\r\nwaters of the gulf, instant in their humane pilgrimage to otherwise\r\nfrozen and uninhabitable lands; before them the low, infectious\r\n_tierra caliente_ that skirts the lofty interior threateningly,\r\nlike the poisoned garment of Hercules, with vegetation bloated by\r\nthe noxious air and by nourishment sucked from the putrid remains\r\nof nature’s opulence, while over all, filled with the remembrance\r\nof streams stained sanguine from sacrificial altars, passes with\r\nsullen sighs the low-voiced winds. But a change comes gradually\r\nas the steep ascent is made that walls the healthful table-land of\r\nAnáhuac. On the _templada_ terrace new foliage is observed, though\r\nstill glistening with sun-painted birds and enlivened by parliaments\r\nof monkeys. Insects and flowers bathe in waves of burning light until\r\nthey display a variety of colors as wonderful as they are brilliant,\r\nwhile from cool cañons rise metallic mists overspreading the warm\r\nhills. Blue and purple are the summits in the distance, and dim glowing\r\nhazy the imperial heights beyond that daily baffle the departing\r\nsun. And on the broad plateau, whose rich earth with copious yield\r\nof gold and grain allures to cultivation, all the realm are out of\r\ndoors keeping company with the sun. From afar comes the music-laden\r\nbreeze whispering its secrets to graceful palms, aloft against the\r\nsky, and which bend to meet the confidence, while the little shrubs\r\nstand motionless with awe. Each cluster of trees repeats the story,\r\nand sings in turn its own matin to which the rest are listeners. At\r\nnight, how glittering bright with stars the heavens, which otherwise\r\nwere a shroud of impenetrable blackness. In this land of wild Arcadian\r\nbeauty the beasts are free, and man keeps constant holiday. And how\r\nthe hearts of these marauders burned within them as they thought,\r\nnothing doubting, how soon these glories should be Spain’s and theirs.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of the Totonac territory was crossed, and on the fourth\r\nday the army entered a province called by Cortés Sienchimalen,\r\nwherein the sway of Montezuma was still maintained. This made no\r\ndifference to the Spaniards, however, for the late imperial envoys\r\nhad left orders with the coast governors to treat the strangers\r\nwith every consideration. Of this they had a pleasing experience\r\nat Xicochimalco,[268] a strong fortress situated on the slope of\r\na steep mountain, to which access could be had only by a stairway\r\neasily defended. It overlooked a sloping plain strewn with villages\r\nand farms, mustering in all nearly six thousand warriors.[269] With\r\nreplenished stores the expedition began to ascend the cordillera\r\nin reality, and to approach the pine forests which mark the border\r\nof the _tierra fria_. Marching through a hard pass named Nombre de\r\nDios,[270] they entered another province defended by a fortress, named\r\nTeoxihuacan,[271] in no wise inferior to the first for strength or\r\nhospitality. They now finished the ascent of the cordillera, passed\r\nthrough Tejotla, and for three days continued their way through the\r\nalkaline wastes skirting the ancient volcano of Nauhcampatepetl,[272]\r\nexposed to chilling winds and hailstorms, which the Spaniards with\r\ntheir quilted armor managed to endure, but which caused to succumb many\r\nof the less protected and less hardy Cubans. The brackish water also\r\nbrought sickness. On the fourth day the pass of Puerto de Leña,[273]\r\nso called from the wood piled near some temples, admitted them to the\r\nAnáhuac plateau, over seven thousand feet above the sea. With a less\r\nbalmy climate and a flora less redundant than that of the Antillean\r\nstamping-ground, it offered on the other hand the attraction of being\r\nnot unlike their native Spain. A smiling valley opened before them,\r\ndoubly alluring to the pinched wanderers, with its broad fields of\r\ncorn, dotted with houses, and displaying not far off the gleaming\r\nwalls and thirteen towering temples of Xocotlan, the capital of the\r\ndistrict. Some Portuguese soldiers declaring it the very picture of\r\ntheir cherished Castilblanco, this name was applied to it.[274]\r\n\r\nCacique Olintetl, nicknamed the temblador from the shaking of his fat\r\nbody, came forth with a suite and escorted them through the plaza to\r\nthe quarters assigned them, past pyramids of grinning human skulls,\r\nestimated by Bernal Diaz at over one hundred thousand. There were\r\nalso piles of bones, and skulls suspended from beams, all of which\r\nproduced far from pleasant impressions. This horror was aggravated\r\nby the evident coldness of their reception, and by the scanty fare\r\noffered.[275] Olintetl occupied what Cortés describes as the “largest\r\nand most finely constructed houses he had yet seen in this country,”\r\nwherein two thousand servants attended to the wants of himself and\r\nhis thirty wives.\r\n\r\nImpressed by the magnificence of his surroundings, Cortés inquired\r\nwhether he was a subject or ally of Montezuma. “Who is not his slave?”\r\nwas the reply. He himself ruled twenty thousand subjects,[276] yet\r\nwas but a lowly vassal of the emperor, at whose command thirty chiefs\r\nat least could place each one hundred thousand warriors in the field.\r\nHe proceeded to extol the imperial wealth and power, and the grandeur\r\nof the capital, wherein twenty thousand human victims were annually\r\ngiven to the idols. This was probably intended to awe the little\r\nband; “But we,” says Bernal Diaz,[277] “with the qualities of Spanish\r\nsoldiers, wished we were there striving for fortunes, despite the\r\ndangers described.” Cortés calmly assured the cacique that great as\r\nMontezuma was, there were vassals of his own king still mightier,\r\nwith more to the same effect; and he concluded by demanding the\r\nsubmission of the cacique, together with a present of gold, and the\r\nabandonment of sacrifices and cannibalism. Olintetl’s only reply was\r\nthat he could do nothing without authority from the capital. “Your\r\nMontezuma,” replied the audacious Spaniard, with suppressed anger,\r\n“shall speedily send you orders to surrender to me gold or any other\r\ndesired effects in your possession.”\r\n\r\nMore generous were the caciques of two towns at the other end\r\nof the valley, who brought a few golden trifles and eight female\r\nslaves.[278] The revelations of the Cempoalans and of Marina concerning\r\nthe wonderful power of the Spaniards, and the honors paid them by\r\nMontezuma’s envoys, had the effect of making Olintetl also more liberal\r\nwith provisions at least. Being asked about the road to Mexico he\r\nrecommended that through Cholula, but the Cempoalans representing\r\nthe Cholultecs as highly treacherous, and devoted to the Aztecs, the\r\nTlascalan route was chosen, and four Totonac chiefs were despatched to\r\nask permission of the republican rulers to pass through their lands.\r\nA letter served as mystic credentials, and a red bushy Flemish hat\r\nfor a present.[279]\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of four days the army proceeded up the valley, without\r\nleaving the customary cross, it seems, with which they had marked\r\ntheir route hitherto; the reason for this was the objection of Padre\r\nOlmedo to expose the emblem to desecration in a place not wholly\r\nfriendly to them.[280] The road lay for two leagues through a densely\r\nsettled district to Iztacmixtitlan, the seat of Tenamaxcuicuitl, a\r\ntown which Cortés describes as situated upon a lofty height, with very\r\ngood houses, a population of from five to six thousand families, and\r\npossessing comforts superior to those of Xocotlan. “It has a better\r\nfortress,” he writes, “than there is in half Spain, defended by a\r\nwall, barbican, and moats.” The cacique who had invited the visit\r\nmade amends for the cold reception of the previous chief, and the\r\nSpaniards remained for three days waiting in vain for the return of\r\nthe messengers sent to Tlascala. They then passed onward, reinforced\r\nby about three hundred warriors from the town.[281] Two leagues’ march\r\nbrought them to the boundary of Tlascala, conspicuous by a wall of\r\nstone and mortar nine feet in height and twenty in breadth, which\r\nstretched for six miles across a valley, from mountain to mountain,\r\nand was provided with breastworks and ditches.[282]\r\n\r\nBetween latitude 19° and 20° ranges of hills cut the plain of Anáhuac\r\ninto four unequal parts. In the centre of the one eastward stood\r\nthe capital of Tlascala. The state so carefully protected was about\r\nthe same small territory which we now see on the map,[283] with\r\ntwenty-eight towns, and one hundred and fifty thousand families,\r\naccording to the rough census taken by Cortés.[284] A branch of the\r\nTeo-Chichimec nation, the Tlascaltecs had, according to tradition,\r\nentered upon the plateau shortly before the cognate Aztecs, and, after\r\noccupying for a time a tract on the western shore of Tezcuco Lake,\r\nthey had tired of the constant disputes with neighboring tribes and\r\nproceeded eastward, in three divisions, the largest of which had, late\r\nin the thirteenth century, taken possession of Tlascala, ‘Place of\r\nBread.’ The soil was rich, as implied by the name, but owing to the\r\ncontinued wars with former enemies, reinforced by the Aztecs, they\r\nfound little opportunity to make available their wealth by means of\r\nindustries and trade, and of late years a blockade had been maintained\r\nwhich deprived them of many necessaries, among others salt. But the\r\ngreater attention given in consequence to agriculture, had fostered\r\ntemperate habits and a sinewy constitution, combined with a deep love\r\nfor the soil as the source of all their prosperity. Compelled also\r\nto devote more time and practice to warfare for the preservation of\r\ntheir liberty than to the higher branches of culture, they presented\r\nthe characteristics of an isolated community, in being somewhat behind\r\ntheir neighbors in refinement, as well as in the variety of their\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nIn government the state formed an aristocracy, ruled by a senate of\r\nthe nobility, presided over by four supreme hereditary lords, each\r\nindependent in his own section of the territory. This division extended\r\nalso to the capital, which consisted of four towns, or districts,\r\nTizatlan, Ocotelulco, Quiahuiztlan, and Tepeticpac, ruled respectively\r\nby Xicotencatl, Maxixcatzin, Teohuayacatzin, and Tlehuexolotl.[285]\r\n\r\nIt was before this senate that the messengers of Cortés appeared,\r\ninforming them in the name of the Cempoalan lord of the arrival of\r\npowerful gods from the east, who having liberated the Totonacs from\r\nMontezuma’s sway, now desired to visit Tlascala in passing through to\r\nMexico, and to offer their friendship and alliance. The messengers\r\nrecommended an acceptance of the offer, for although few in number\r\nthe strangers were more than equal to a host. They thereupon depicted\r\ntheir appearance, their swift steeds, their savage dogs, their\r\ncaged lightning, as well as their gentle faith and manners. The\r\nmessengers having retired, the senate proceeded to discussion. Prudent\r\nMaxixcatzin, lord of the larger and richer industrial district, called\r\nattention to the omens and signs which pointed to these visitors, who\r\nfrom all accounts must be more than mortal, and, if so, it would be\r\nbest to admit them, since resistance must be vain. Xicotencatl, the\r\neldest lord, replied to this that the interpretation of the signs\r\ncould not be relied on. To him these beings seemed monsters rejected\r\nby the sea-foam, greedy of gold and luxuries, whose steeds devoured\r\nthe very ground. To admit them would be ruinous. Besides, should the\r\ninvincible Tlascaltecs submit to a mere handful? The gods forbid! It\r\nwas further argued that the amicable relations of the strangers with\r\nMontezuma and his vassals did not accord with their protestations\r\nof friendship. This might be one of the many Aztec plots to obtain a\r\nfooting in the country. Nor did the destruction of idols at Cempoala\r\nincrease the confidence of a people so jealous of its institutions. The\r\ndiscussion waxing warmer, senator Temilotecatl suggested the middle\r\ncourse of letting the Otomí frontier settlers, who were thoroughly\r\ndevoted to their Tlascaltec patrons, make an attack on the invaders,\r\naided by their own general Axayacatzin Xicotencatl, son of the old\r\nlord, and known by the same name. If successful, they could claim the\r\nglory; if not, they might grant the victors the permission they had\r\ndesired, while casting the blame for the attack on the Otomís. This\r\nwas agreed to.[286]\r\n\r\nAs the Spaniards halted before the great wall, speculating on the\r\nstrength of the people who had erected it, and upon the possible\r\ntraps it might hide, their late hosts again besought them to take\r\nthe Cholula route, but Cempoalan counsel prevailed. Waving aloft his\r\nbanner, Cortés exclaimed: “Behold the cross! Señores, follow it!”\r\nAnd with this he led the way through the semicircular laps of the\r\nentrance. The wall was not provided with sentinels, and the army\r\nmet with no obstacles.[287] Attended by ten horsemen, the general\r\nadvanced to reconnoitre. After proceeding about four leagues he caught\r\nsight of fifteen armed Indians, who were pursued and overtaken. A\r\nfight ensued, in which the natives, nerved by despair, fought so\r\nfiercely that two horses were killed, and three horses and two riders\r\nwounded.[288] Meanwhile a force of Indians came up, estimated at from\r\nthree to five thousand, and a horseman was at once sent back to hurry\r\nforward the infantry, while the rest boldly charged the enemy, riding\r\nthrough their ranks, and killing right and left without being injured\r\nthemselves. On the approach of the foot-soldiers, and the discharge\r\nof a volley, the natives retired with about sixty of their number\r\nslain.[289] Shortly afterward two of the Cempoalan messengers returned\r\nwith some Tlascaltecs, who expressed their sorrow at the attack made\r\nby a tribe not belonging to their nation. They offered to pay for the\r\nhorses killed, and invited the Spaniards in the name of the lords to\r\nproceed. The army advanced for a league into more open country, and\r\ncamped among some abandoned farms, where dogs proved to be the only\r\nfood left. Thus ended the first day in Tlascalan territory, the first\r\nof September, according to Bernal Diaz.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the Spaniards met the two other messengers returning\r\nfrom their mission to Tlascala, who told a harrowing story of their\r\nseizure for the sacrificial stone, and of their escape by night. It\r\nis probable that their detention by the Tlascaltecs for messenger\r\npurposes had frightened them into believing that they were destined\r\nto be sacrificed, for envoys enjoyed the greatest respect among the\r\nNahuas.[290] Shortly after a body of over one thousand warriors[291]\r\nappeared, to whom Cortés, in presence of the notary Godoy, sent three\r\nprisoners, with a formal assurance of his friendly intentions. The\r\nonly reply being showers of arrows, darts, and stones, Cortés gave\r\nthe “Santiago, and at them!” and charged. The enemy retreated with\r\nthe face to their pursuers, enticing them toward some broken ground\r\nintersected by a creek, where they found themselves surrounded by a\r\nlarge force, some bearing the red and white devices of Xicotencatl.\r\nMissiles were showered, while double-pointed spears, swords, and clubs\r\npressed closely upon them, wielded by bolder warriors than those\r\nwhom the Spaniards had hitherto subdued. Many were the hearts that\r\nquaked, and many expected that their last moment had come; “for we\r\ncertainly were in greater peril than ever before,” says Bernal Diaz.\r\n“None of us will escape!” exclaimed Teuch, the Cempoalan chief, but\r\nMarina who stood by replied with fearless confidence: “The mighty\r\nGod of the Christians, who loves them well, will let no harm befall\r\nthem.”[292] The commander rode back and forth cheering the men, and\r\ngiving orders to press onward, and to keep well together. Fortunately\r\nthe pass was not long, and soon the Spaniards emerged into an open\r\nfield, where the greater part of the enemy awaited them, estimated in\r\nall, by different authorities, at from thirty thousand to one hundred\r\nthousand.[293]\r\n\r\nHow long was this to continue, each new armed host being tenfold\r\ngreater than the last? Yet once again the Spaniards whet their swords,\r\nand prepare for instant attack, as determined to fight it out to the\r\ndeath, as Leonidas and his brave Spartans at the pass of Thermopylæ.\r\nThe cavalry charged with loose reins, and lances fixed on a range\r\nwith the heads of the enemy, opening a way through the dense columns\r\nand spreading a confusion which served the infantry well. Bernal\r\nDiaz relates how a body of natives, determined to obtain possession\r\nof a horse, surrounded an excellent rider named Pedro de Moron, who\r\nwas mounted upon Sedeño’s fine racing mare, dragged him from the\r\nsaddle, and thrust their swords and spears through the animal in all\r\ndirections. Moron would have been carried off but for the infantry\r\ncoming to his rescue. In the struggle which ensued ten Spaniards were\r\nwounded, while four chiefs bit the dust. Moron was saved only to die\r\non the second day, but the mare was secured by the natives and cut\r\ninto pieces, which were sent all over the state to afford opportunity\r\nfor triumphal celebrations. The loss was greatly regretted, since it\r\nwould divest the horses of their terrifying character. Those previously\r\nkilled had been secretly buried. The battle continued until late\r\nin the afternoon, without enabling the Indians to make any further\r\nimpression on the Spanish ranks than inflicting a few wounds, while\r\ntheir own were rapidly thinning under the charges of the cavalry\r\nand the volleys of artillery and firelocks. The slaughter had been\r\nparticularly heavy among the chiefs, and this was the main reason\r\nfor the retreat which the enemy now began, in good order.[294] Their\r\nactual loss could not be ascertained, for with humane devotion the\r\nwounded and dead were carried off the moment they were stricken; and\r\nin this constant self-sacrificing effort the Tlascaltecs lost many\r\nlives and advantages. Robertson regards with suspicion the accounts\r\nof the great battles fought during the conquest, wherein Indians fell\r\nby the score while the Spaniards stood almost unscathed, and Wilson\r\nridicules the whole campaign, reducing the Tlascalan population, for\r\ninstance, to about ten thousand, with a fighting force of less than\r\none thousand men. Such remarks certainly show a want of familiarity\r\nwith the subject.[295] We have often seen, in the New World wars, a\r\nthousand naked Americans put to flight by ten steel-clad Europeans,\r\nand I have clearly given the reasons. When we look at the Indians,\r\nwith their comparatively poor weapons, their unprotected bodies, their\r\ninefficient discipline and tactics, whereby only a small portion of\r\ntheir force could be made available, the other portion serving rather\r\nas an obstruction, their custom of carrying off the dead, and other\r\nweak points, and when we contrast them with the well armored Spaniards,\r\nwith their superior swords and lances, their well calculated movements,\r\nand their concerted action carried out under strict and practised\r\nofficers, and above all their terror-inspiring and ravaging fire-arms\r\nand horses—how can we doubt that the latter must have readily been\r\nable to overcome vast numbers of native warriors? It was soon so\r\nunderstood in Europe. For once when Cortés was in Spain he scoffed at\r\ncertain of his countrymen for having fled before a superior force of\r\nMoors, whereupon one remarked: “This fellow regards our opponents like\r\nhis, of whom ten horsemen can put to flight twenty-five thousand.” In\r\nthe retreat of the Ten Thousand, who under Cyrus had invaded Persia,\r\nwe have an example of the inadequacy of numbers against discipline.\r\nThough for every Greek the Persians could bring a hundred men, yet\r\nthe effeminate Asiatic absolutely refused to meet the hardy European\r\nin open conflict. Æschylus was inspired by personal experience in his\r\nplay of the Persians when he makes the gods intimate to the wondering\r\nAtossa, the queen-mother, that free Athenians, unwhipped to battle,\r\ncould cope successfully with the myriads of despotic Xerxes. The poor\r\nAmericans had yet to learn their own weakness, and to pay dearly for\r\nthe knowledge.\r\n\r\n“It well seems that God was he who fought for us to enable us to get\r\nfree from such a multitude,” says Cortés. He attempted no pursuit,\r\nbut hastened to take possession of Tecohuatzinco, a small town on\r\nthe hill of Tzompachtepetl,[296] where they fortified themselves\r\nupon the temple pyramid, and proceeded to celebrate the victory with\r\nsongs and dances, a performance wherein the allies took the leading\r\npart. The following day[297] Cortés sallied forth with the horses,\r\none hundred infantry, and seven hundred allies, partly to forage\r\nbefore the enemy appeared, but also to inflict some damage, and to\r\nshow that they were as fresh as ever. “I burned five or six small\r\nvillages,” he says, “each of about one hundred families, and returned\r\nwith four hundred prisoners.”[298] After being consoled with food and\r\nbeads, the captives, including fifteen taken during the late battle,\r\nwere despatched to the camp of Xicotencatl, two leagues off, with\r\na letter to serve as credentials, and a message assuring him of the\r\nfriendly intentions of the Spaniards, although they had been obliged\r\nto resort to severe measures. By no means impressed either with his\r\ndefeat or with the assurances, Xicotencatl replied that peace would\r\nbe celebrated at his father’s town with a feast on the Spaniards’\r\nflesh, while their hearts and blood were delighting the gods. They\r\nwould receive a more decisive answer on the morrow. With this defiant\r\nmessage came the report that the Tlascalan army, largely reinforced,\r\nwas preparing to march on and overwhelm them. “When we learned this,”\r\nsays Bernal Diaz, “being men, we feared death, many of us; and all\r\nmade confession to the Merced father, and the clergyman Juan Diaz, who\r\nall night remained present to listen to the penitent; and we commended\r\nourselves to God, praying that we might not be conquered.” Cortés\r\napplied himself energetically to supervise preparations and give the\r\nenemy a welcome. A fresh supply of arrows, and of Indian shields of\r\nplaited cane and cotton, were made, and the arms and accoutrements\r\ninspected. He impressed upon the soldiers the necessity of keeping\r\nclose together, round the banner to be carried well aloft by Alférez\r\nCorral, in order that they might not be cut off. As for the cavalry\r\nthey were to make repeated charges, without losing time in delivering\r\nthrusts.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of September 5th the Indian army could be\r\nseen extending far over the field, terrible in war-paint, plumed\r\nhelmets, and gaudy shields, with their double-edged flint swords and\r\nmany-pointed lances gleaming in the sun, while the air resounded with\r\nshrill yells, mingling with the melancholy tones of their drums and\r\nthe doleful blasts of conchs and trumpets.[299] It was the largest and\r\nfinest army yet seen by the Spaniards, numbering, according to Gomara,\r\none hundred and fifty thousand men, but according to Bernal Diaz\r\nonly fifty thousand,[300] in four divisions, representing Tizatlan,\r\nOcotelulco, Quiahuiztlan, and Tepeticpac, each distinguished by its\r\nown banner and colors, the latter noticeable also in the war-paint of\r\nthe common soldier and in the quilted armor of the officers. Far in\r\nthe rear, indicative of hostile sentiment, rose the standard of the\r\nstate, bearing a bird with wings extended.[301] Gomara relates that,\r\nconfident of success, the Tlascaltecs sent messengers to the camp\r\nwith three hundred turkey-cocks and two hundred baskets of tamales,\r\neach of one hundred arrobas, so that they might not be taunted with\r\nhaving fought starved men, or having offered such to the idols.\r\n\r\nBut this story, adopted by Herrera, Clavigero, Robertson, and nearly\r\nevery other writer, implies a generosity altogether too impolitic for\r\nan enemy who had already suffered two severe defeats. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that Xicotencatl may have sent small presents of food in\r\norder to obtain an opportunity for his spies to examine the camp.[302]\r\n\r\nThe Indians advanced in several columns up the sides of the hill, and,\r\ndespite the resistance offered, pressed onward into the very camp,\r\nbut were soon obliged to yield before murderous bullets and cutting\r\nblades. Cortés allowed the Indians to become tired and discouraged with\r\nrepeated charges, and then with a ringing “Santiago!” the Spaniards,\r\nfollowed by the allies, sallied forth,[303] driving them in confusion\r\nto the plain, where the cavalry followed up the advantage, leaving\r\nbloody paths in all directions. Checked and reinforced by the reserve,\r\nthe enemy turned with fresh courage on their pursuers. The shock\r\nwas overwhelming. The tired Castilians yielded; their ranks were\r\nbroken, and all seemed lost. Even Cortés was seized with a terrible\r\nmisgiving, but it was only for a moment. Leading the cavalry to the\r\nrescue, he raised his voice above the din of battle, and called on\r\nall to rally. Nerved by his words and deeds, the men plied lustily\r\ntheir swords, and, driving back the enemy, formed anew. “So ably and\r\nvaliantly fought the horsemen,” writes Bernal Diaz, “that next to\r\nGod who protected us, they proved our strength.” Following up their\r\nadvantage, the Spaniards hewed down the enemy in great numbers.\r\n\r\nVictory might yet have turned against them but for a quarrel between\r\nXicotencatl and another captain,[304] one accusing the other of\r\nmismanaging the late battle. The latter not only challenged the other,\r\nit seems, but withdrew his troops, and induced another division to\r\nfollow him.[305] Thus left with only half his army, and that shattered\r\nand discouraged, Xicotencatl retired before the handful on whom his\r\nevery effort seemed to have made no impression. He retreated in good\r\norder, carrying off most of the dead, for the opponents were too\r\nexhausted to pursue. Indeed, all the horses were wounded, and fully\r\nsixty men, of whom it appears several must have died soon after,\r\nthough Cortés admits of no dead, and Bernal Diaz of only one.[306]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [265] ‘Y todos â vna le respondimos, que hariamos lo que\r\n     ordenasse, que echada estaua la suerte de la buena ò mala\r\n     ventura.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 40.\r\n\r\n     [266] Bernal Diaz states, 65, that on reaching Mexico City\r\n     ‘no llegauamos á 450 soldados,’ intimating that they must\r\n     have amounted to fully this figure on leaving Villa Rica.\r\n     This would allow fully 120 men to Escalante, which appears\r\n     a large garrison, even after making allowances for the old\r\n     and infirm. Gomara places the force at 400 Spaniards, with\r\n     15 horses, 6 guns, and 1300 Indians, including Cubans and\r\n     carriers. _Conq. Mex._, 67; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vi.\r\n     cap. i.; _Torquemada_, i. 411, 517. Ixtlilxochitl increases\r\n     this to 7 guns, 1300 warriors, and 1000 carriers. ‘Con\r\n     quince de caballo y trescientos peones.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     52. Cortés refers later on to 400 Cempoalans. He mentions\r\n     merely 200 carriers. Clavigero has 415 Spaniards, a figure\r\n     resulting from a misreading of his original. _Storia Mess._,\r\n     iii. 36. Solis, _Hist. Mex._, i. 216-17, followed of course\r\n     by Robertson, changes the figures to 500 men, 200 carriers,\r\n     and 400 Indian troops. A page, twelve years old, was left\r\n     with the lord of Cempoala to learn the language. ‘Tomaron\r\n     un indio principal que llamaban _Tlacochalcatl_ para que los\r\n     mostrase el camino,’ taken from the country by Grijalva, and\r\n     brought back by Cortés. _Sahagun_, _Conq. Mex._, 16. Shortly\r\n     before beginning the march, says Duran, a messenger arrived\r\n     from Mexico in the person of Motelchiuh, sent by Montezuma\r\n     to serve as guide, and to provide for the proper service\r\n     and hospitality on the way. Being told that no guide was\r\n     needed, he returned, leaving orders with the caciques en\r\n     route to tender good reception to the strangers. _Duran_,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 405-10.\r\n\r\n     [267] Meaning ‘Spring in the Sand.’ _Rivera_, _Hist. Jalapa_,\r\n     i. app. 7. ‘Y la primera jornado fuimos â vn pueblo, que se\r\n     dize Xalapa.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 41. But the\r\n     road was too long for one day’s march. I may here observe\r\n     that Bernal Diaz is remarkably faulty in his account of\r\n     this march and of the campaign into Tlascala, and this is\r\n     admitted by several writers, who nevertheless follow him\r\n     pretty closely. The place is known the world over for its\r\n     fairs and productions, particularly for the drug bearing\r\n     its name, and is famous in the neighboring districts for\r\n     its eternal spring and beautiful surroundings.\r\n\r\n     [268] Identified with Naulinco. _Lorenzana_, _Viage_, p. ii.\r\n\r\n     [269] Cortés refers to a friendly chat with the governor,\r\n     who mentioned the orders he had received to offer the\r\n     Spaniards all necessities. _Cartas_, 57.\r\n\r\n     [270] ‘Por ser el primero que en estas tierras habíamos\r\n     pasado. El cual es tan agro y alto, que no lo hay en España\r\n     otro.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 57. ‘Hoy se llama _el Paso del\r\n     Obispo_.’ _Lorenzana_, ubi sup. ‘Ay en ella muchas parras con vuas,\r\n     y arboles cõ miel.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 68.\r\n\r\n     [271] ‘Hoy se nombra _Ixhuacán_ de los Reyes.’ _Lorenzana_,\r\n     _Viage_.\r\n\r\n     [272] ‘De _Nauhcampa_, quatre parties, et _tepetl_,\r\n     montagne.’ _Humboldt_, _Vues_, ii. 191. Equivalent to the\r\n     Spanish name of Cofre de Perote.\r\n\r\n     [273] Lorenzana believes it to be the later Sierra de la\r\n     Agua. A map with profile of the route is given in _Carbajal\r\n     Espinosa_, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 201; and a still better map by\r\n     Orozco y Berra, _Itinerario_, in _Noticias Mex._, 233.\r\n\r\n     [274] The name must not be confounded with Zacatlan, as\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl calls it, for this lies north of Tlascala.\r\n     ‘Este valle y poblacion se llama Caltanmi.’ ‘Tenia las\r\n     mayores y mas bien labradas casas que hasta entonces ...\r\n     habiamos visto.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 58. Lorenzana says,\r\n     ‘the present Tlatlanquitepec,’ in the lower lying portion of\r\n     which stood the palace of Caltanni, ‘house below;’ and there\r\n     stands the big tree to which the natives say that Cortés tied\r\n     his horse. _Viage_, pp. iii.-iv. ‘Llamase ... Zaclotan aquel\r\n     lugar, y el valle Zacatami.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 68;\r\n     _Oviedo_, iii. 260. Cocotlan. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     41.\r\n\r\n     [275] Gomara intimates that the Spaniards were well received,\r\n     and had 50 men sacrificed in their honor. _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     68. The native records state that bread sprinkled with the\r\n     blood of fresh victims was offered to them, as to idols,\r\n     but this being rejected with abhorrence, pure food was\r\n     brought. Before this sorcerers had been sent to use their\r\n     arts against them, by spreading diseases, casting spells\r\n     to prevent their advance, and otherwise opposing them. But\r\n     everything failed before the magic influence shed perhaps\r\n     by the banner of the cross. _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._, MS.,\r\n     ii. 401-8; _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, 14; _Acosta_, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, 518; _Torquemada_, i. 417-8.\r\n\r\n     [276] ‘Tenia Montezuma en este pueblo, y su comarca, cinco\r\n     mil soldados de guarnicion.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vi.\r\n     cap. ii.\r\n\r\n     [277] _Conq. Mex._, 42. ‘A muchos valientes por ventura\r\n     desmayara,’ says to the contrary Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 69.\r\n\r\n     [278] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 59. Bernal Diaz assumes that\r\n     Olintetl was persuaded by the Cempoalans to conciliate\r\n     Cortés with four slaves, a few paltry pieces of jewelry,\r\n     and a load of cloth.\r\n\r\n     [279] Camargo sends the letter from Cempoala, together with\r\n     a sword, a crossbow, and a red silk cap. _Hist. Tlax._, 145.\r\n     But it is not probable that Cortés would deprive himself\r\n     of such needful articles, not overabundant with him, even\r\n     if he had no objection to let Indians examine them. Bernal\r\n     Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 42-3, despatches two Cempoalans from\r\n     a later station, and this on hearing that the Tlascaltecs\r\n     had risen to oppose them.\r\n\r\n     [280] Still Gomara, in his sweeping way, declares that Cortés\r\n     ‘puso muchas cruzes en los templos, derrocãdo los idolos\r\n     como lo hazia en cada lugar.’ _Hist. Mex._, 70; _Tapia_,\r\n     _Relacion_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 567. Twenty\r\n     leading warriors were taken from here, says Bernal Diaz.\r\n\r\n     [281] Clavigero calls them ‘un competente numero di truppe\r\n     Messicane del presidio di Xocotla,’ _Storia Mess._, iii.\r\n     41, which is unlikely.\r\n\r\n     [282] See _Native Races_, ii. 568, et seq.\r\n\r\n     [283] Fifteen leagues from west to east, ten from north to\r\n     south, says Torquemada, i. 276. Herrera extends it to 30\r\n     leagues in width.\r\n\r\n     [284] ‘Hay en esta provincia, por visitacion que yo en\r\n     ella mandé hacer, ciento cincuenta mil vecinos.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 69. In the older edition of these letters by\r\n     Lorenzana, it reads, 500,000 families, a figure which in\r\n     itself indicates an exaggeration, but has nevertheless been\r\n     widely copied. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 87.\r\n\r\n     [285] For further information about Tlascala, see _Native\r\n     Races_, ii. and v. Torquemada gives a detailed history of\r\n     the state in i. 259-78. See also _Prescott’s Mex._, 411-19;\r\n     _Soria_, _Istoria y Fundacion de la Ciudad de Tlaxcala_,\r\n     MS. in Aztec, sm. 4º of 48 leaves.\r\n\r\n     [286] _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vi. cap. iii., confounds\r\n     the two Xicotencatls, and Torquemada, in seeking to correct\r\n     him, applies the title of general to Maxixcatzin, i. 416,\r\n     supposing besides, with Clavigero, that Temilotecatl may\r\n     be another name for Tlehuexolotl. _Storia Mess._, iii.\r\n     40; _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat.

After they had started on this\r\n     mission the idols were consulted, but remained mute; the\r\n     temples were overthrown by earthquakes, and comets appeared,\r\n     creating a general panic. _Hist. Tlax._, 144-6. The account\r\n     of the conquest by this author is particularly interesting\r\n     since Diego Muñoz Camargo was a native of the valiant\r\n     little republic of Tlascala, a mestizo, says Veytia, _Hist.\r\n     Ant. Méj._, ii. 91, who calls him Domingo, while Clavigero\r\n     gives him nobility. _Storia Mess._, i. 10. Born shortly\r\n     after these events, and in contact with the very men who\r\n     figured therein, his stories are reproduced from their lips,\r\n     though colored with the spirit of a convert and patriot\r\n     who, like nearly all of his countrymen, was only too eager\r\n     to curry favor with the dominant race. This is apparent in\r\n     nearly every line of his text, wherein the terms of praise\r\n     bestowed on the conquerors become not unfrequently absurd\r\n     from the contradictions implied by other passages. Nor\r\n     does he neglect to hold forth on his own people for their\r\n     bravery and exploits in fighting the detested Aztecs, and\r\n     their unswerving devotion to the Spaniards. In the pursuit\r\n     of this pleasing theme he scruples not to sacrifice truth\r\n     when it proves a stumbling-block. He leaves the impression,\r\n     for instance, that the Tlascaltecs never raised sword\r\n     against Cortés. Many of the misstatements are due to a\r\n     non-critical acceptance of tales, for Camargo was as simple\r\n     and superstitious as any of his contemporaries. Although\r\n     acting as interpreter in the province, _Torquemada_, i. 523,\r\n     he exhibits a not very thorough acquaintance with Spanish,\r\n     which is the cause of errors and repetitions. The conquest\r\n     forms but a portion of his narrative, which treats chiefly\r\n     of aboriginal history and customs, and touches lightly the\r\n     events that passed before his eyes. It was written in 1585,\r\n     and lay for some time in the Felipe Neri convent archives,\r\n     where it was consulted by Torquemada. Taken afterward by\r\n     Panes to Spain, it was deposited by Muñoz with the Royal\r\n     Academy of History at Madrid, from which source copies\r\n     were obtained, among others one by Ternaux-Compans, and a\r\n     faulty translation was published in the _Nouvelles Annales\r\n     des Voyages_, xcviii.-ix.\r\n\r\n     [287] A short distance further they passed through a pine\r\n     grove, wherein threads and papers were fixed and scattered\r\n     across the path, the work of Tlascaltec sorcerers, who thus\r\n     sought to cast a spell upon the invaders. _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. vi. cap. iv.\r\n\r\n     [288] ‘Segun algunos que lo vieron, cortaron cercen de\r\n     vn golpe cada pescueço con riendas y todo.’ _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 71. ‘Io viddi che cõbattẽdosi vn dì, diede\r\n     vn Indiano vna cortellata a vn cauallo ... nel petto, che\r\n     glielo aperse fin alle ĩteriora, et cadde icõtanẽte morto,\r\n     & ... che vn’ altro Indiano diede vn’ altra cortellata\r\n     a vn’ altro cauallo su il collo che se lo gettò morto.’\r\n     _Relatione per vn gentil’huomo_, in _Ramusio_, _Viaggi_,\r\n     iii. 305. According to Duran two warriors stepped forth\r\n     from a vast Tlascalan army before the regular battle, and\r\n     issued a challenge, which was accepted by two horsemen.\r\n     After a short combat the Indians, by deft movements, killed\r\n     both horses, cutting off the neck of one, and wounding\r\n     the other in the pasterns. _Hist.

According to Bernal Diaz the messengers are met\r\n     before the Tlascalan border is reached, and they deliver the\r\n     announcement that the Tlascaltecs will kill the Spaniards and\r\n     eat their flesh, in order to test their reputed strength.\r\n     The Cempoalans shall suffer the same fate, since they are\r\n     assumed to be plotting in behalf of the Aztecs, loc. cit.\r\n     Sahagun supposes that the Cempoalan guide had treacherously\r\n     led the Spaniards against the Otomís. _Conq.

The duel\r\n     was held in front of the armies, and after a tough struggle\r\n     the Cempoalan, with a feint, threw his opponent off guard,\r\n     and secured his head, which served as a centre-piece during\r\n     the Cempoalan victory celebration. _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     vi. cap. vi.

He who prints and pays the printer\r\n     generally has something to say, and generally believes\r\n     something of what he says to be true. An idiot may have\r\n     honest convictions, and a knave may have talents, but\r\n     where a book carries to the mind of the reader that its\r\n     author is both fool and knave, that is, that he writes only\r\n     foolishness and does not himself believe what he says, I\r\n     have not the time to waste in condemning such a work. And\r\n     yet here is a volume purporting to be _A New History of\r\n     the Conquest of Mexico_, written by Robert Anderson Wilson,\r\n     and bearing date Philadelphia, 1859, which one would think\r\n     a writer on the same subject should at least mention. The\r\n     many and magnificent monuments which to the present day\r\n     attest the great number and high culture of the Nahua race,\r\n     and the testimony to this effect offered by witnesses on\r\n     all sides, are ignored by him with a contempt that becomes\r\n     amusing as the pages reveal his lack of investigation and\r\n     culture. Indeed, the reader need go no further than the\r\n     introduction to be convinced on the latter point. Another\r\n     amusing feature is that the work pretends to vindicate the\r\n     assertions of Las Casas, who, in truth, extols more than\r\n     other Spanish author the vast number and advanced culture\r\n     of the natives. In addition to this mistaken assumption,\r\n     which takes away his main support, he states that Prescott\r\n     worked in ignorance of his subject and his authorities,\r\n     and to prove the assertion he produces wrongly applied or\r\n     distorted quotations from different authors, or assumes\r\n     meanings that were never intended, and draws erroneous\r\n     conclusions. Thus it is he proves to his own satisfaction\r\n     that Mexico City was but a village occupied by savages of\r\n     the Iroquois stamp, and that Cortés was the boastful victor\r\n     over little bands of naked red men. As for the ruins, they\r\n     were founded by Phœnician colonists in remote ages. Another\r\n     tissue of superficial observations, shaped by bigotry and\r\n     credulous ignorance, was issued by the same author under\r\n     the title of _Mexico and its Religion_, New York, 1855,\r\n     most enterprisingly reprinted in the disguise of _Mexico:\r\n     its Peasants and its Priests_, New York, 1856. In common\r\n     with Mr Morgan, and others of that stamp, Mr Wilson seems\r\n     to have deemed it incumbent on him to traduce Mr Prescott\r\n     and his work, apparently with the view of thereby attracting\r\n     attention to himself. Such men are not worthy to touch\r\n     the hem of Mr Prescott’s garment; they are not worthy of\r\n     mention in the same category with him.\r\n\r\n     [296] _Lorenzana_, _Viage_, ix., wherein the appearance of the hill\r\n     is described as the bishop saw it. _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 292; _Camargo_, _Hist.

Bernal Diaz writes,\r\n     however, that this day was devoted to rest. Still, a later\r\n     observation indicates that Cortés is right.\r\n\r\n     [298] _Id._ Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 44, admits only\r\n     twenty captives, and blames the allies for firing the\r\n     villages; but Cortés is frank enough about it.\r\n\r\n     [299] Prescott, _Mex._, 438-42, gives a pretty description\r\n     of the army, but is so carried away that he dons it with\r\n     helmets glittering with gold and precious stones, etc.; and\r\n     this in spite of the efforts of the chroniclers to exhibit\r\n     the Tlascaltecs as very poor in anything but rude comforts.\r\n\r\n     [300] Under five captains, to whom he applies the names of\r\n     the four lords, as he understands them, and of the ruler of\r\n     Huexotzinco. _Hist.

Gomara proceeds to relate that\r\n     in sign of contempt for the small number of the enemy,\r\n     whom it could be no honor for his large army to overcome,\r\n     Xicotencatl detached 2000 warriors—200 says Oviedo—to seize\r\n     and bring him the strangers bound. They attacked, and were\r\n     routed with an almost total destruction of their number.\r\n     ‘No escapo hombre dellos, sino los q̄ acertaron el passo\r\n     de la barranca.’ loc. cit. 76.\r\n\r\n     [303] Bernal Diaz states that they did not wait for the\r\n     enemy to attack, but marched forth and met them one eighth\r\n     of a league from camp. _Hist. Verdad._, 45. But Cortés says\r\n     distinctly, ‘Otro dia en amaneciendo dan sobre nuestro real\r\n     mas de ciento y cuarenta y nueve mil hombres.’ _Cartas_,\r\n     62. Gomara and Herrera also allow Indians to attack the\r\n     camp first. Cortés is too fond of announcing when he takes\r\n     the initiative to have failed to say so had he done it in\r\n     this case.\r\n\r\n     [304] ‘Son of Chichimeclatecle,’ says Bernal Diaz, a name\r\n     which should read Chichimeca-tecuhtli.\r\n\r\n     [305] That of Guaxolcingo—meaning Huexotzinco. _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 45. That of Tlehuexolotzin. _Clavigero_,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 46. Solis exaggerates this into an\r\n     actual battle between the leaders and their followers. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, i. 255-8. Herrera intimates that a secret arrangement\r\n     had been formed between Cortés and the seceding captain,\r\n     the latter appearing with his officers at the camp, the\r\n     evening after the previous battle, and, declaring himself\r\n     convinced that the Spaniards were invincible, offered not\r\n     only to remain neutral, but to aid them in entering Tlascala.\r\n     Cortés agreed. When the captain returned to Xicotencatl’s\r\n     camp he was so badly beaten that he came back to Cortés\r\n     for medical treatment. Certain signs were to be worn, so\r\n     that the Spaniards might respect the neutral troops. dec.\r\n     ii. lib. vi. cap. vi. He also relates that one Tlascaltec\r\n     maintained himself so long and bravely against two Spanish\r\n     soldiers that Láres, the smith, rushed up, cried shame upon\r\n     the twain, and lanced the warrior. _Id._, cap. vii.\r\n\r\n     [306] This soldier himself received two wounds, which\r\n     did not prevent him from fighting, however. ‘Nos mataron\r\n     vn soldado,’ he says, and a few lines further down, ‘y\r\n     enterramos los muertos ... porque no viessen los Indios\r\n     que eramos mortales.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 45. Thus even the\r\n     ‘True Historian’ reveals the common weakness. _Hazart_,\r\n     _Kirchen-Geschichte_, ii. 512-14; _West-Indische Spieghel_,\r\n     224-35; _Franck_, _Weltbuch_, ccxxix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nENTRY INTO TLASCALA.\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER, 1519.\r\n\r\n     NATIVE CHIEFS SENT AS ENVOYS TO THE TLASCALAN CAPITAL—THEIR\r\n     FAVORABLE RECEPTION—XICOTENCATL PLANS RESISTANCE\r\n     TO CORTÉS—SENDS OUT SPIES—CORTÉS SENDS THEM BACK\r\n     MUTILATED—THE SPANIARDS ATTACK AND DEFEAT XICOTENCATL—NIGHT\r\n     ENCOUNTERS—GENERAL DISSATISFACTION AND A DESIRE TO\r\n     RETURN TO VILLA RICA—ENVOYS ARRIVE FROM MONTEZUMA—CORTÉS\r\n     RECEIVES XICOTENCATL AND THE TLASCALAN LORDS—PEACE\r\n     CONCLUDED—TLASCALA—FESTIVITIES AND REJOICINGS—MASS\r\n     CELEBRATED—CORTÉS INCLINED TO EXTREME RELIGIOUS ZEAL—BRIDES\r\n     PRESENTED TO THE SPANIARDS—APPROPRIATE CEREMONIES—PREPARING\r\n     TO LEAVE TLASCALA FOR CHOLULA—COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE\r\n     CHOLULTECS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the late battle three chiefs had been captured, and they together\r\nwith two others were sent, this time to the Tlascalan capital direct,\r\nto carry an offer of peace, and to explain that the Spaniards would\r\nnot have harmed their warriors had they not been obliged to do so.\r\nIf peace was still declined they would come and destroy them all.\r\nMeanwhile Cortés set out on another foraging and raiding expedition,\r\nand “burned more than ten towns, one exceeding three thousand houses,”\r\nretiring by the early afternoon, when the Indians began to gather in\r\naid of the raided neighbors.[307]\r\n\r\nTired of the fruitless fighting, attended with loss of life and\r\nproperty only to themselves as it appeared, the peace party in Tlascala\r\nhad been gaining the ascendancy, with the efforts of Maxixcatzin,\r\nsupported as he now was by the powerful factions which had quarrelled\r\nwith the general. When the peace messengers of Cortés arrived they\r\nwere therefore received with favor. His previous friendly offers\r\nwere considered, also his kind treatment of captives, so unusual\r\nwith the natives, and the oracles and signs of a coming race of\r\nrulers. Whether gods or men, they were evidently invincible, and the\r\nfriendship and alliance held out by them must be desirable, and ought\r\nto be secured before the strangers, embittered by further resistance,\r\nshould pass on to join their enemies. An embassy, headed by Costomatl\r\nand Tolinpanecatl,[308] was accordingly despatched with provisions\r\nand some other trifling gifts to open negotiations for peace. Humbly\r\nthese men appeared before Cortés, expressing the sorrow of the lords\r\nfor the hostility shown, and their desire for peace. With a grave\r\nreproval for their obstinacy, Cortés said that he would admit their\r\napology, and the envoys departed, after leaving beside the other\r\ngifts a number of male and female slaves.[309]\r\n\r\nSmarting under the disgrace of his defeats, Xicotencatl had meanwhile\r\nbeen laying plans to retrieve himself. Among other counsellors he had\r\nsummoned diviners to his aid, and they, calling to mind the assumption\r\nthat the Spaniards were children of the sun, declared that as such\r\nthe new-comers were invincible only when animated by its beams, and at\r\nnight, when deprived of this invigorating power, they became mortals,\r\nwho must bow to superior force. Knowing the strength of the party\r\nopposed to him in the Tlascalan capital, he does not appear to have\r\nsubmitted his projects there, but to have ventured upon detaining the\r\nenvoys as they were returning from the Spanish camp until the result\r\nof his plans should have been ascertained; and this in face of the\r\ncommand to desist from hostility.[310] In order to make everything as\r\nsure as possible for the intended blow, Xicotencatl sent fifty Indians\r\nto the camp, with instructions to gather information concerning the\r\napproaches, the condition of the soldiers, and other points. They\r\nappeared before Cortés with the usual demonstrations of respect, and,\r\nplacing before him five female slaves, a quantity of food, and other\r\npresents, they said: “Lord, behold these slaves! If you are fierce\r\ngods, eat their flesh and blood, and more shall be brought; if gentle\r\ngods, take these feathers and incense; if men, here are fowl, bread,\r\nand fruit.” Cortés answered that they required no sacrifices of men.\r\nHad they desired such they could have taken by force all the victims\r\nneeded. He rebuked their obstinacy and advised submission.[311] They\r\nwere then taken aside to receive the hospitalities of the camp, after\r\nwhich they dispersed to satisfy their curiosity, and to question the\r\nallies. This aroused the suspicions of Teuch, the Cempoalan chief,\r\nwho warned the general. Seizing the men he examined them singly, and\r\nsoon ascertained that their object was not only to spy, but to fire\r\nthe huts, and otherwise to aid the attack which would be made upon\r\nthe camp that very night. Finding that his friendly advances had been\r\nscorned, Cortés resolved to inflict a lesson that would be understood\r\nby a people so deeply intent upon war and sacrifices. This was to cut\r\noff the hands of the leading spies, and the thumbs of others, and to\r\nsend them back with the message that this would be the punishment of\r\nspies, and that the Spaniards were prepared, night or day, to face\r\ntheir enemies.[312]\r\n\r\nFearing the confusion and danger of a night attack, when the artillery\r\nand other means would be less effective, Cortés resolved to anticipate\r\nthe enemy by a counter charge, wherein the cavalry might render\r\nparticular service. Learning that Xicotencatl was hidden with ten\r\nthousand or twenty thousand men behind a hill not far off, Cortés\r\ndid not despatch the mutilated spies till after dusk, in order to\r\nlet him approach nearer to camp.[313] When his messengers returned\r\nto Xicotencatl and displayed their bleeding stumps, the general\r\nwas troubled, and throughout his army there was consternation, and\r\nnumbers of warriors declared openly that it was useless to fight men\r\nwho not only appeared to be invincible, but who could read their very\r\nintentions. While in this state of demoralization they were startled\r\nby the jingling of bells and the tramp of the dreaded horses, magnified\r\nby their fears and by the weird moonlight into a host. The next moment\r\nthe Spaniards announced their presence by a ringing “Santiago!” and,\r\nundeterred by the few stray and feeble volleys of stones and arrows\r\nsent against them, they rode into the crowds of natives already in\r\nfull flight, slashing and riding down in all directions.[314]\r\n\r\nAfter this lesson Xicotencatl appears to have made no further attempts\r\nto molest the Spaniards, although small skirmishing parties, chiefly\r\nOtomís, continued to hover round the camp and give the soldiers\r\nopportunities for sallies. Gomara magnifies these skirmishes into\r\ndaily attacks on the camp by the army, whose divisions take turns so\r\nas not to embarrass one another. This caused them to fight better,\r\npartly from a spirit of rivalry to surpass the preceding record. The\r\nambition of the natives was to kill one Spaniard at least, but the\r\nobject was never attained, so far as they knew. This continued for\r\na fortnight, and daily came also messengers with food to sustain the\r\nstrangers.[315]\r\n\r\nIn order to farther impress upon the Indians that fighting by night\r\nwas quite congenial to the Spaniards, Cortés set out one midnight to\r\nraid and forage in the direction of a large town called Tzompantzinco,\r\nwhich could be distinguished beyond a range of hills, toward the\r\ncapital.[316] The soldiers had not gone far before one horse after\r\nanother began to tremble and fall, including the general’s. This was\r\nregarded a bad omen, and the men urged a return, but Cortés laughed it\r\noff, sent back five horses, and proceeded with the rest, declaring that\r\nGod, in whose cause they were engaged, was superior to nature.[317]\r\nTwo small villages were surprised, with some slaughter, and shortly\r\nbefore dawn the Spaniards fell upon the large town, containing twenty\r\nthousand houses, it is said. Frightened out of their senses by the\r\nnoise, the people rushed from the dwellings to join in the crowd\r\nwhich sought to elude the pursuers. Finding that no resistance was\r\nattempted, Cortés speedily stopped the attack, and collecting his men\r\nin the plaza he forbade any attempt on life or property. The chiefs\r\nand priests presently appeared with gifts of food and two female\r\nslaves, pleading that the proximity of Xicotencatl’s army had prevented\r\nthem from sending in their submission. They would henceforth prove\r\ntheir gratitude for his leniency by sending supplies to the camp.\r\nCortés accepted their excuses, and told them to proceed to Tlascala\r\nto urge upon the lords the necessity for accepting peace. Before\r\nreturning, Cortés ascended a hill, and thence saw the capital, with\r\nits surrounding villages. “Behold,” he said to those who had objected\r\nto his leniency with the towns, “what boots it to have killed these\r\npeople, when so many enemies exist over there?”[318]\r\n\r\nAlthough left in comparative peace for some days, the end of the\r\ncampaign seemed to the Spaniards as remote as ever. The harass and\r\nhardship of their life, the vigils, the cold nights, the scanty\r\nsupplies, the absence of salt, medicine, and many other necessaries,\r\nall this was severely felt, particularly since so large a number\r\nwere either sick or wounded, including Cortés and Padre Olmedo.[319]\r\nThe ailments and wounds were as a rule slight, yet they helped to\r\nmagnify dangers, and to dim every cheerful aspect. The very cessation\r\nof regular hostile demonstrations seemed to cover a plot for a new\r\nTlascalan combination. If this people could exhibit such armies\r\nand such valor, what must be expected from the far more numerous\r\nand equally warlike Aztecs? These views owed not a little of their\r\nacceptance to the fears and exaggeration of the Indian allies, and\r\nthrough their medium the prospect of reaching the impregnable Mexico\r\nbegan to appear preposterous. Cortés was aware that this feeling\r\nexisted among a large number, for in making his customary tour of\r\nthe camp one evening he had overheard a party of soldiers express\r\nthemselves pretty strongly about the madness of his enterprise. It\r\nwould happen to him as to Pedro Carbonero, who ventured with his force\r\namong the Moors and was never heard of again. The general should be\r\nleft to go alone.\r\n\r\nThe murmurs in camp grew particularly strong during the raid on\r\nTzompantzinco, promoted of course by Velazquez’ men; and when Cortés\r\nreturned, a deputation of seven, whom Bernal Diaz forbears to name,\r\nappeared before him to recommend that, in view of the suffering, the\r\ndanger, and the dark prospects, they should return to Villa Rica,\r\nbuild a vessel, and send to Cuba for reinforcements. They were only\r\ntempting providence by their foolhardy course. Finding that arguments\r\nwould be lost on these men, Cortés had caused his adherents to rally,\r\nand turning to them he recalled the determination formed at Villa\r\nRica to advance on Mexico, and extolled their valorous deeds, which\r\ndimmed even the Greek and Roman records. He was suffering equally with\r\nthem, yet he wavered not. Should they, the brave Spaniards, belie\r\ntheir character and country, and desert their duty to their king,\r\nto their God, who had protected them hitherto? To retreat now would\r\nbe to abandon the treasures to be found only a few leagues off, the\r\nreward for which they had striven during a whole year, and to draw upon\r\nthemselves the contempt not only of their countrymen, who at present\r\nlooked on them as the bravest of the brave, but that of the natives,\r\nwho regarded them as gods. The Tlascaltecs had already sued for peace,\r\nbut let the Spaniards take one step in retreat, and the enemy would\r\nturn with renewed ardor on them, joined by the Mexicans, so far held\r\nin check by their fame and deeds. Even the allies would for their own\r\nsafety join to crush them. To retire was impossible, because it would\r\nbe fatal. In any case, death was preferable to dishonor. The usual\r\nmarks of approval which followed the speech silenced the deputation,\r\nand nothing more was heard about retreat.[320]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreat was the sensation in Mexico at the successive reports of easy\r\nSpanish victories over the stanch armies of Tlascala—victories by an\r\ninsignificant band over armies which had successfully resisted the\r\nvast forces of the Anáhuac allies. Since it was only too evident that\r\nforce could not keep the strangers from reaching the capital, Montezuma\r\nagain called his council to consider the situation. Cuitlahuatzin\r\nproposed that they should be bought off with presents, while Cacama\r\nrepresented that their mission was probably harmless, and that they\r\nshould be frankly invited to the city, there to be awed with the\r\ngrandeur of the monarch. Others favored this course, but with the\r\nidea of laying traps for the strangers. The fear of their being warned\r\nand aided by Ixtlilxochitl, the rebellious brother of Cacama, caused\r\nMontezuma to incline to the advice of Cuitlahuatzin; and six prominent\r\nlords, headed by Atempanecatl,[321] were accordingly despatched to the\r\nSpanish camp to congratulate the white chieftain on his victories,\r\nand to offer annual tribute in gold, silver, jewels, cloth—in fact,\r\nto do almost anything that his king might desire, on the condition\r\nthat he should not proceed to Mexico. The envoys entered the presence\r\nof Cortés followed by two hundred attendants, and laying before him\r\na present of twenty bales of embroidered cloth and feathers, and\r\nabout one thousand castellanos in gold-dust, they delivered their\r\nmessage.[322] They explained that their monarch would gladly see him\r\nin Mexico, but feared to expose the Spaniards to the hardships of the\r\nrough and sterile country wherein Mexico was situated. Cortés expressed\r\nhis thanks, and said that he would consider the proposal.[323]\r\n\r\nWhile entertaining the Mexican envoys the camp was stirred by the\r\nannouncement of the Tlascalan plenipotentiaries, consisting of fifty\r\nleading men, headed by Axayacatzin Xicotencatl himself.[324] The\r\nsoldiers crowded forward to gaze at the dreaded general, who appeared\r\nto be a man of about thirty-five years, tall and broad-shouldered,\r\nwell formed and robust, with broad, rough face, grave in manner and\r\ncommanding in presence, though he came a suppliant. He had used every\r\nmeans as a noble patriot to save his country from the enslavement\r\nwhich he seemed with prophetic spirit to have foreseen; and as a\r\nbrave soldier he had struggled to uphold the honor of the army. With\r\npride subdued he had sought pardon of the lords for disobeying their\r\norders,[325] and offered the best amends in his power by personally\r\nhumbling himself before the chief who had torn the wreath from\r\nhis brow. He approached Cortés with the customary profound salute,\r\nwhile his attendants swung the copal censer, and announced that he\r\nhad come in the name of his father and the other lords to ask his\r\nfriendship, and to offer their submission to the mightiest of men, so\r\ngentle yet so valiant. Accepting a seat by Cortés’ side, he entered\r\ninto explanations, and frankly took upon himself the blame for the\r\nresistance offered, but pleaded the Tlascalan love for liberty,\r\nthreatened, as they imagined, by an ally of Montezuma, for were not\r\nMexican allies in the Spanish train? and had not the Aztec monarch\r\nexchanged friendly intercourse with them? While delighted with the\r\nmanner of the chief, and particularly with the object of his visit,\r\nCortés thought it necessary to administer a slight rebuke for the\r\nobstinate refusal of his friendly offers; yet since his people had\r\nalready suffered enough for this, he freely pardoned them in the\r\nname of his king, and received them as vassals.[326] He hoped the\r\npeace would be permanent; if not, he would be obliged to destroy the\r\ncapital and massacre the inhabitants. Xicotencatl assured him that\r\nthe Tlascaltecs would henceforth be as faithful as they had hitherto\r\nbeen unfriendly. In proof of their sincerity the chiefs would remain\r\nwith him as hostages. He begged Cortés to come to the city, where\r\nthe lords and nobles were awaiting him, and regretted not being able\r\nto offer a present worthy of his acceptance, but they were poor in\r\ntreasures, even in cloth and salt, and what they once possessed had\r\nbeen surrendered to the Mexicans.[327]\r\n\r\nMass was said by Padre Diaz to celebrate the concluded peace, and in\r\nhonor of the occasion Tecohuatzinco received the name of Victoria.[328]\r\nBoth Spaniards and allies concluded the day with feasting and\r\nappropriate demonstrations of their delight. At Tlascala, where it\r\nwas soon understood that the Spaniards were in some way to liberate\r\nthe state from the tyranny of Montezuma, floral decorations and\r\nsacrifices gave eclat to the festivities, and twenty thousand leading\r\nmen are said to have taken part in the _mitote_ dance, singing to\r\nthe prospective overthrow of the Mexicans and to the glory of the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican envoys felt not a little chagrined at a peace which\r\ncould bode no good to their nation. Before Cortés, however, they\r\nsought to ridicule the whole proceeding as a farce on the part of the\r\nTlascaltecs. The latter were too treacherous to be trusted. When the\r\nSpaniards were once in their city they would fall on them, and avenge\r\nthe defeats and losses which till then must rankle in their hearts.\r\nCortés told them that the Spaniards could not be overcome in town\r\nor field, by day or night. He intended going to Tlascala, and if the\r\ninhabitants proved treacherous they would be destroyed. Xicotencatl\r\nhad been no less abusive of the Mexicans during his late interview,\r\nand Cortés, as he declares, enjoyed their dissension, sympathizing\r\nalternately with either party, in order to promote his own ends.[329]\r\nFinding the general so determined, the envoys begged that he would\r\nremain at the camp for a few days while they communicated with the\r\nemperor. This was granted, partly because Cortés wished to await\r\ndevelopments, not being at all sure of the Tlascaltecs, and partly\r\nbecause he and others needed a respite to recover from their wounds\r\nand fevers.[330]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe only result of the message to Mexico appears to have been\r\nan instruction to the envoys to use every effort to prevent the\r\nSpaniards from going either to Tlascala or to Mexico; and to make\r\ntheir representations more weighty a present was sent, consisting of\r\nten pieces of wrought gold, worth over three thousand castellanos,\r\nsays Bernal Diaz, and of several hundred pieces of cotton fabrics,\r\nrichly embroidered.[331] It served but as another magnet to aid in\r\nattracting the invaders. Cortés accepted the presents, but held out\r\nno hopes of changing his determination.\r\n\r\nThe Tlascaltecs had meanwhile kept the camp liberally supplied with\r\nprovisions, for which they would accept no recompense, and were daily\r\nurging Cortés to depart for Tlascala. Alarmed at his delay, the lords\r\nthought it best to go in person, accompanied by the leading nobles,\r\nto entreat him.[332] The last envoy from Montezuma had just delivered\r\nhis presents when they were announced. Descending from their litters\r\nthey advanced toward Cortés with the customary salute,[333] the lead\r\nbeing taken by Xicotencatl, ruler of Tizatlan, so blind and old\r\nthat he had to be supported by attendants, and by Maxixcatzin, of\r\nOcotelulco, the youngest and wisest of the lords.[334]\r\n\r\nXicotencatl expressed his sorrow for their resistance, but reminded\r\nthe Spanish chief that, this being forgiven, they had now come to\r\ninvite him to their city, and to offer their possessions and services.\r\nHe must not believe the slanderous insinuations which they feared the\r\nMexicans had uttered. Cortés could not resist the evident sincerity\r\nof this appeal from so prominent a body, and he hastened to assure\r\nthem that preparations for the departure and other affairs had alone\r\ndetained him.[335]\r\n\r\nThe lords accordingly returned to prepare for the reception, and to\r\nsend five hundred carriers to assist in the march, which began the\r\nfollowing morning. The Mexican envoys were invited to accompany the\r\nSpaniards, in order that they might witness the honors paid to them.\r\nThe road to Tlascala, some six leagues in length, passed through\r\na hilly yet well cultivated country, skirted on the east by the\r\nsnow-crowned peak which was soon to bear the revered name of Malinche.\r\nIn every direction were verdure-clad slopes spotted with huge oaks,\r\nwhile above and beyond the vista was closed by a dark green fringe of\r\nthe hardier fir, which seemed to rise like shielding bulwarks round\r\nthe settlements in the valleys. The leading towns on the route were\r\nTzompantzinco and Atlihuetzin, where the population turned out _en\r\nmasse_ to receive the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a league from the capital they were met by the lords\r\nand nobles, accompanied by a great retinue, attired in the colors of\r\nthe different districts. Women of rank came forward with flowers in\r\ngarlands and bouquets; and a long line of priests in flowing white\r\nrobes, with cowls, and flowing hair clotted with blood from freshly\r\nslashed ears, marched along swinging their copal censers, while in\r\nthe rear and around surged a crowd estimated at one hundred thousand\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nBefore them rose the capital, prominently located upon four hills,\r\n“so great and so admirable,” quoth Cortés, “that although I say but\r\nlittle of it, that little will appear incredible, for it is much\r\nlarger than Granada and much stronger, with as good edifices and with\r\nmuch more people than Granada had at the time it was captured; also\r\nmuch better supplied with the things of the earth.”[336] There were\r\nfour distinct quarters, separated by high stone walls and traversed\r\nby narrow streets. In each stood a lordly palace for the ruler, and\r\nhere and there rose temples and masonry buildings for the nobles, but\r\nthe greater part of the dwellings were one-story adobe and mud huts.\r\nThe highest quarter in situation was Tepeticpac, the first settled,\r\nseparated from Ocotelulco by the river Zahuatl.[337] The latter was\r\nnot only the largest and most populous, but the richest, and held a\r\ndaily market attended by thirty thousand people, it is claimed.[338]\r\nQuiahuiztlan lay below on the river, and above it Tizatlan, the\r\nresidence of the blind chief.[339]\r\n\r\nIt was here that the Spaniards entered on September 23d,[340]\r\nhenceforth a feast-day to its people. Through streets adorned with\r\nfestoons and arches, and past houses covered with cheering multitudes,\r\nthey proceeded to the palace of Xicotencatl, who came forward to\r\ntender the customary banquet. Cortés saluted him with the respect due\r\nto his age,[341] and was conducted to the banquet-hall, after which\r\nquarters were pointed out in the courts and buildings surrounding the\r\ntemple.[342] Neat beds of matting and nequen cloth were spread for\r\nthe troops. Close by were the quarters of the allies and the Mexican\r\nenvoys.\r\n\r\nA round of invitations and festivities was tendered the guests in\r\nthe several quarters; yet Cortés allowed no relaxation in the usual\r\ndiscipline and watches, greatly to the grief of the lords, who\r\nfinally remonstrated against this apparent want of confidence. The\r\nMexicans must have poisoned the mind of Malinche against them, they\r\nsaid. Malinche was becoming a recognized name for Cortés among the\r\nIndians. It seems strange that they should have fixed upon no higher\r\nsounding title for so great a leader than ‘master of Marina,’ as\r\nit implied, while the inferior Alvarado was dubbed Tonatiuh, ‘the\r\nsun.’ The Tlascaltecs had, however, another name for the general in\r\nChalchiuitl, the term for their favorite precious stones, and also\r\na title of Quetzalcoatl, ‘the white god.’[343] Cortés was quite\r\ntouched by the fervor of the lords in their newly formed friendship.\r\nUntutored in some respects, they appeared to rush like children from\r\none extreme to another—from obstinate enmity to profound devotion,\r\nnow worshipping the doughty little band who had overcome their vast\r\nnumber, and admiring their every trait and act, willing to yield\r\nlife itself for the heroic leader. He hastened to assure them of his\r\nconfidence, and declined the hostages they offered, asserting that\r\nstrict discipline was part of the military system which he was in duty\r\nbound to maintain. This seemed to convince the lords, and they even\r\nsought to introduce among their own troops some of the regulations\r\nwhich they learned to admire.\r\n\r\nThe second day of their sojourn Padre Diaz said mass in the presence\r\nof the two leading lords, who thereupon presented Cortés with half a\r\ndozen fishes made of gold, several curious stones, and some nequen\r\ncloth, altogether worth about twenty pesos, says Bernal Diaz.[344]\r\nInsignificant as was the gift, they expressed a hope that in view\r\nof their poverty he would accept it as a token of friendship. Cortés\r\nassured them that “he received it from their hand with greater pleasure\r\nthan he would a house filled with gold dust from others.”[345] In\r\nreturn he gave them some of the robes and other useful articles\r\nobtained from Montezuma, beside beads and trinkets. They now proposed,\r\nas a further proof of their good-will, to bestow on the captains\r\ntheir daughters, in order to have for relatives men so good and brave.\r\nCortés expressed himself pleased, but explained that this could not\r\nbe admitted till the Tlascaltecs renounced idolatry and its attendant\r\nevils.[346] He thereupon proceeded to expound to them the doctrines of\r\nhis faith and contrast them with the impure, cruel, and bloody rites\r\npractised by them. This was ably interpreted by Marina and Aguilar,\r\nwho were by this time expert in preaching, and the cross and virgin\r\nimage were produced to illustrate the discourse. The lords answered\r\nthat they believed the Christian’s God must be good and powerful, since\r\nhe was worshipped by such men, and they were willing to accord him\r\na place by the side of their idols;[347] but they could not renounce\r\ntheir own time-honored and benevolent deities. To do so would be to\r\ncreate an uprising among the people, and bring war and pestilence\r\nfrom the outraged gods. Cortés produced further arguments, only to\r\nbe told that in time they would better understand the new doctrines,\r\nand might then yield, but at present their people would choose death\r\nrather than submit to such sacrilege.\r\n\r\nFinding that the religious zeal of Cortés threatened to overcome his\r\nprudence, Padre Olmedo hastened to interpose his counsel, representing\r\nthe danger of losing all that their valor and perseverance had gained\r\nif they pressed so delicate a subject with a superstitious and warlike\r\npeople as yet only half gained over. He had never approved of forcible\r\nconversion, and could see no advantage in removing idols from one\r\ntemple when they would be sure to rise in another. Indeed, persecution\r\ncould only tend to root idolatry more deeply in the heart. It were\r\nbetter to let the true faith work its way into the appreciation of\r\nthe people, as it would be sure to do if the natives were given an\r\nopportunity to contrast their bloody rites with the religion of Christ,\r\nprovided the Spaniards would themselves follow the precepts of love\r\nand gentleness they were commending to the Indians. The success of\r\nthe conquest owes much to Olmedo, whose heart, like Las Casas’, warmed\r\nfor the benighted Indians, to him wayward children who must be won by\r\nmoderation. Like a guardian angel he rose in defence of his flock,\r\nsaving at the same time the Spaniards from their own passions.[348]\r\nAlvarado, Velazquez de Leon, and others, who had no desire to witness\r\na repetition of the Cempoalan iconoclasm, supported the father in his\r\ncounsel, and Cortés agreed to content himself for the present with\r\nhaving an appropriate place set aside in the temple for an altar and\r\na cross.[349] And upon this cross, say the credulous chroniclers,\r\na white radiant cloud, in form of a whirling pillar, descended at\r\nnight from the sky, impressing the natives with the sacredness of\r\nthe symbol, and guarding it till the conquest had established the\r\nfaith in the land.[350] The Spaniards succeeded further in abolishing\r\nhuman sacrifices, and the fattening-cages being torn down, a large\r\nnumber of intended victims sought refuge in their camp, lauding their\r\ndoctrines and aiding not a little to pave the way for conversion.[351]\r\n\r\nThe inaugural mass for the new altar was followed by the baptism of\r\nthe brides, the daughters and nieces of the lords being the first to\r\nundergo the ceremony. Cortés pleading that he was already married,\r\nTecuilhuatzin, the daughter of Xicotencatl, destined for him, was\r\nat his request given to Alvarado, his brother and captain as he\r\nproclaimed him, and blessed with the name of Luisa, while her sister\r\nTolquequetzaltzin, baptized as Lucía, was conferred on the brother,\r\nJorge de Alvarado. Maxixcatzin’s niece Zicuetzin, a pretty girl,\r\nwas named Elvira and given to Velazquez de Leon, it appears. Olid,\r\nSandoval, Ávila, and others also received distinguished brides with\r\ndowries. Cortés found it necessary, however, to decline accepting\r\nwives for the whole company, as the lords proposed.[352] Indeed, they\r\nurged him to settle among them, offering to give lands and to build\r\nhouses for the whole party.[353]\r\n\r\nFinding him determined to proceed to Mexico, they offered their\r\ncoöperation, and gave an account of the wealth, power, and condition\r\nof the lake states, dwelling in particular on the magnificence of\r\nMontezuma. They did not omit a tirade against his tyranny, and stated\r\nthat whenever he proposed to attack Tlascala no less than one hundred\r\nthousand men were placed in the field. It was because they were\r\nforewarned that their resistance was so successful, and because the\r\nAztec troops, gathered as they were to a great extent from subject\r\nprovinces, fought with less spirit.[354]\r\n\r\nCortés had now a further motive for going to Mexico, which was the\r\nalliance proposed to him by Ixtlilxochitl, the rebellious brother of\r\nCacama, and ruler of northern Acolhuacan, who hoped with Spanish aid\r\nto overthrow the hated Montezuma, and raise himself to the throne\r\nof Tezcuco, at least, and to the head of the allied states. To this\r\npleasing proposal Cortés replied in a manner which could not fail to\r\npromote his own interests by keeping alive the spirit of dissension\r\namong his prey.[355] Huexotzinco, the ally of Tlascala, sent in her\r\nformal adhesion about the same time.\r\n\r\nFinding that the Spaniards could not be kept away from Mexico,\r\nMontezuma thought it best at any rate to hasten their departure\r\nfrom Tlascala. An urgent invitation to visit him in his capital\r\nwas accordingly sent through four prominent caciques, attended by\r\nfollowers bearing as usual a costly present, consisting of ten bales\r\nof embroidered robes and a number of gold articles, worth fully ten\r\nthousand pesos.[356] A council was held to consider the departure\r\nand the route to be taken. The lords of Tlascala did not relish the\r\nidea of a friendly visit to Mexico by their new allies, to be won\r\nover perhaps by the arts of the enemy. They sought to impress upon\r\nCortés that Montezuma was the incarnation of treachery, awaiting only\r\nan opportunity to get them into his power and to crush them. They\r\nwere ready to join in an armed descent upon the tyrant, proposing to\r\nspare neither young nor old; the former, because they might grow up\r\nto be avengers, the latter because of their dangerous counsel. Cortés\r\nsuggested that he might yet establish friendly relations between them\r\nand the Mexicans, and reopen the trade in salt, cotton, and other\r\narticles; but this aroused only an incredulous smile. With regard\r\nto the route, they favored either the Calpulalpan road, proposed by\r\nIxtlilxochitl, or that leading through Huexotzinco, friendly to them,\r\ndeclaring that it would be preposterous to pass by the way of Cholula,\r\nas urged by the Mexican envoys, since this was the very hatching-place\r\nfor Montezuma’s plots. The road to it, and every house there, were\r\nfull of snares and pitfalls; the great Quetzalcoatl temple-pyramid,\r\nfor instance, being known to contain a mighty stream which could at\r\nany moment be let loose upon invaders, and Montezuma having a large\r\narmy hidden near the saintly city.[357]\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary accounts of Cholula served to arouse Cortés’\r\ncuriosity, and the representation of dangers made him the more\r\nresolved to encounter them, chiefly because he did not wish to appear\r\nintimidated. This route was beside easier, and passed through a rich\r\ncountry. He accordingly decided in favor of it, and when reminded of\r\nthe suspicious absence of any deputation from that city, he sent a\r\nmessage to the rulers that they might remedy the omission.[358]\r\n\r\nThe Cholultec council was divided on the answer to be sent, three\r\nof the members being in favor of compliance, and the other three,\r\nsupported by the generalissimo, opposing any concession.[359] Finally\r\na compromise was effected by sending three or four persons of no\r\nstanding, and without presents, to say that the governors of the\r\ncity were sick and could not come. The Tlascaltecs pointed out the\r\ndisrespect in sending such men and such a message, and Cortés at\r\nonce despatched four messengers to signify his displeasure, and to\r\nannounce that unless the Cholultecs within three days sent persons\r\nof authority to offer allegiance to the Spanish king, he would march\r\nforth and destroy them, proceeding against them as against rebels.[360]\r\n\r\nFinding that it would not do to trifle with the powerful strangers,\r\nsome of the highest nobles in the city were despatched to the Spanish\r\ncamp, with a suitable retinue, to tender excuses, pleading that they\r\nhad dreaded to enter Tlascala, a state hostile to them.\r\n\r\nThey invited Cortés to their city, where amends would be made by\r\nrendering the obedience and tribute which was considered due from\r\nthem as vassals of his king.[361]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [307] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 62-3. According to Gomara the\r\n     Indians pursued to the very camp, where they were defeated\r\n     with great slaughter, after five hours’ fighting. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 76-7.\r\n\r\n     [308] _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._, 146. Duran gives a short\r\n     speech, delivered in the council-chamber. _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     MS., ii. 422-3.\r\n\r\n     [309] Cortés places the arrival of this embassy on the\r\n     day following the raiding of the ten towns, _Cartas_, 63;\r\n     but Bernal Diaz at a later date. He makes the envoys four\r\n     in number, and allows them, in returning, to instruct the\r\n     neighboring settlements to furnish supplies to the Spaniards,\r\n     all of which Xicotencatl prevents. _Hist. Verdad._, 47-8,\r\n     50, 55.\r\n\r\n     [310] Bernal Diaz assumes that the lords consult the\r\n     diviners, and allow a night attack to be made; but then\r\n     he describes two night attacks, while Cortés and others\r\n     distinctly allow only one, and he forgets his former\r\n     admission that, in addition to the peace party, half the\r\n     army had actually abandoned Xicotencatl. It is after this\r\n     first night attack, ignored by other writers, that the\r\n     senate send in their submission, and order Xicotencatl to\r\n     desist from hostilities. He refuses to obey, and detains\r\n     the envoys on their way to the Spaniards, whereupon his\r\n     officers are ordered to desert him. Finally he repents and\r\n     is forgiven. _Hist. Verdad._, 46-7. The detention of the\r\n     envoys must be placed on their return from the Spanish camp,\r\n     for Cortés distinctly states that the peace proposals from\r\n     the lords arrived before the night attack.\r\n\r\n     [311] According to Gomara, Cortés announces that his men\r\n     are mortal like themselves, which is not very likely. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 77. Bernal Diaz calls the slaves four old hags, and\r\n     allows the Indians to act in rather an insulting manner,\r\n     and without tendering the usual courtesies, which is also\r\n     unlikely, when we consider that they had an object to gain.\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 49.\r\n\r\n     [312] ‘Los mandé tomar á todos cincuenta y cortarles las\r\n     manos,’ says Cortés, _Cartas_, 63; but the phrase may be\r\n     loose, for Bernal Diaz specifies only seventeen as sent\r\n     back with hands or thumbs cut off. _Hist. Verdad._, 49.\r\n     ‘El marques les hizo á algunos de ellos contar (sic pro\r\n     cortar) las manos.’ _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, ii. 570. ‘Mandò cortar las manos a siete dellos,\r\n     y a algunos los dedos pulgares muy contra su voluntad.’\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vi. cap. viii. Gomara places\r\n     this occurrence on the 6th of September, but it is most\r\n     likely later, and makes the spies a different party from\r\n     those bringing the slaves and feathers, who arrive on the\r\n     preceding day. _Hist. Mex._, 77-8. Bernal Diaz accounts\r\n     for this difference by stating that the party had been in\r\n     camp since the previous day. Robertson reverses the order\r\n     by assuming that mutilation of the spies so perplexes the\r\n     Indians that they send the men with the slaves and feathers\r\n     to ask whether they are fierce or gentle gods, or men. He\r\n     does not understand why so many as 50 spies should have\r\n     been sent, but had he read Cortés’ letter more closely, he\r\n     would have divined the reason, that they intended to fire\r\n     the camp, and otherwise aid in the attack. He stigmatizes\r\n     as barbarous the mutilation, _Hist. Am._, ii. 42, 451, but\r\n     forgets, in doing so, that the Spanish conquerors belonged\r\n     to an age when such deeds were little thought of. Spies even\r\n     now suffer death, and the above punishment may therefore\r\n     be regarded as comparatively lenient, particularly by a\r\n     people who daily tore out the heart from living victims.\r\n     The mutinous pilot of Villa Rica had his life spared, but\r\n     lost his feet. Cortés, as the captain of a small band,\r\n     was obliged to conform to his age and surroundings in the\r\n     measures taken for its safety.\r\n\r\n     [313] ‘En yendose las espias, vieron de nuestro real como\r\n     atrauessaua por vn cerro grandissima muchedumbre de gente,\r\n     y era la que traya Xicotencatl.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 79.\r\n\r\n     [314] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 63-4; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     78-9; _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii.\r\n     569; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vi. cap. viii. Bernal Diaz\r\n     describes a night attack with 10,000 warriors, made a few\r\n     days before, in which the Spaniards drive back the Indians\r\n     and pursue them, capturing four, while the morning revealed\r\n     twenty corpses still upon the plain. Two of the diviners\r\n     appear to have been sacrificed for their bad advice. He now\r\n     reappears with 20,000 men, but on meeting the mutilated spies\r\n     he becomes disheartened, and turns back without attempting a\r\n     blow. _Hist. Verdad._, 46, 49-50. He is the only authority\r\n     for two night expeditions. Having already been defeated\r\n     in one night attack, Xicotencatl would be less likely to\r\n     attempt a second, particularly since nocturnal movements\r\n     were contrary to Indian modes of warfare. Cortés distinctly\r\n     intimates that the present occasion was the first attempt\r\n     at a night raid. _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 291.\r\n\r\n     [315] He begins to suspect that their object may also have\r\n     been to spy. Cortés was suffering from fever at this time,\r\n     and one night he took pills, a course which among the\r\n     Spaniards involved the strictest care and seclusion from\r\n     affairs. Early in the morning three large bodies of Indians\r\n     appeared, and regardless of his pills Cortés headed the\r\n     troops, fighting all day. The following morning, strange\r\n     to say, the medicine operated as if no second day had\r\n     intervened. ‘No lo cuẽto por milagro, sino por dezir lo que\r\n     passo, y que Cortés era muy sufridor de trabajos y males.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 80. But Sandoval assumes ‘que sin\r\n     duda fue milagro.’ _Hist. Carlos V._, i. 173. Solis applies\r\n     this story to the night attack, which seems plausible, and\r\n     smiles philosophically at Sandoval’s conclusion. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, i. 271; _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 291;\r\n     _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 47-8. ‘Tenia calenturas, ò\r\n     tercianas.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 47. Some place\r\n     the story with the later capture of Tzompantzinco, where\r\n     it is entirely out of place, if indeed worth recording at\r\n     all, for this expedition was a voluntary project, calling\r\n     for no sick men to venture out. Duran relates that, tired of\r\n     being besieged, Cortés one night made a sally in different\r\n     directions. One party surprised all the native leaders\r\n     together and asleep, and brought them to camp. In the morning\r\n     they were sent back to the army, which had awakened to find\r\n     them missing. In recognition of their kind treatment the\r\n     chiefs raised the siege. This is told on the authority of\r\n     an eye-witness, who evidently reserved his choicest stories\r\n     for Padre Duran. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 419-20.\r\n\r\n     [316] Bernal Diaz places it one league from the camp, and\r\n     Tapia four leagues. Ixtlilxochitl calls it Tzimpantzinco;\r\n     others vary.\r\n\r\n     [317] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 80. Tapia allows the horses\r\n     to overcome their attack and proceed. It appears to have\r\n     been due to the cold night winds.\r\n\r\n     [318] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 80-1. According to Herrera,\r\n     Alcalde Mayor Grado counselled Cortés, on seeing this\r\n     populous country, to return to Villa Rica and send to\r\n     Velazquez for aid. Deeply grieved at such advice, the general\r\n     remarked that the very stones would rise against them if\r\n     they retreated, dec. ii. lib. vi. cap. viii.; _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 64-5. Bernal Diaz places this raid before the\r\n     final night attack. _Hist. Verdad._, 47; _Tapia_, _Rel._,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 568-9.\r\n\r\n     [319] ‘Nos vimos todos heridos â dos, y â tres heridos, y\r\n     muy cansados, y otros dolientes ... y faltauan ya sobre\r\n     cincuenta y cinco soldados que se auian muerto en las\r\n     batallas, y dolencias, y frios, y estauan dolientes otros\r\n     doze.’ _Bernal Diaz_, 46. Prescott, i. 458, is careless\r\n     enough to accept this verbally, but the run of the text\r\n     here and elsewhere indicates that the sentence is rather\r\n     figurative. The last four words, ‘twelve others were on the\r\n     sick-bed,’ indicate that only three per cent. were laid low,\r\n     and that the general health and condition must therefore\r\n     have been tolerably good. This also indicates that the 55\r\n     missing soldiers could not have died since they left Vera\r\n     Cruz, as certain writers assume. The only obstacles under\r\n     which the soldiers could have succumbed in any number were\r\n     the several battles with the Tlascaltecs, wherein the total\r\n     number of the wounded nowhere foots up to more than 100. Of\r\n     these 50 per cent. could not have died, to judge from the\r\n     warfare engaged in, and from the very few, a couple at the\r\n     most, it is said, who fell on the field. Nor could diseases\r\n     have killed many during a month’s march through a fine and\r\n     fertile country, for the passage of the Cofre de Perote\r\n     did not affect the Spaniards seriously. Hence it must be\r\n     assumed that the 55 dead include the 35 who fell out of the\r\n     ranks ere the army reached Villa Rica. This leaves, say,\r\n     fifteen casualties for the present expedition since it left\r\n     Villa Rica, and that appears to be a fair proportion. The\r\n     only one who rightly interprets Bernal Diaz on this point\r\n     appears to be Torquemada, who says, ‘desde que salieron de\r\n     Cuba, se avian muerto cinquenta y cinco Castellanos.’ i.\r\n     428. The old soldier confirms the interpretation by stating\r\n     in more than one place that the Spaniards numbered 450, or\r\n     nearly so, on entering Mexico City. ubi sup., 65, 109.\r\n\r\n     [320] Gomara gives a long speech, and intimates that it\r\n     was delivered before a regular meeting. _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     81-3; _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 65; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     vi. cap. ix.; _Torquemada_, i. 428-9; _Tapia_, _Rel._, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 571. Bernal Diaz addresses\r\n     the speech to the committee, and states that Cortés, on\r\n     finding them still unconvinced, abandoned the gentle tone\r\n     he had used, and exclaimed with some asperity that it was\r\n     better to die like brave men than to live dishonored. The\r\n     men being appealed to upheld him, and declared that they\r\n     would listen to no contrary talk. _Hist. Verdad._, 48-9;\r\n     _Solis_, _Hist. Mex._, i. 259-63.\r\n\r\n     [321] Surnamed Tlachpanquizqin, it seems. _Ixtlilxochitl_,\r\n     _Hist. Chich._, 292; _Veytia_, _Hist. Ant. Méj._, iii. 380.\r\n     Bernal Diaz calls them five leading men.\r\n\r\n     [322] Nearly every writer states that Montezuma acknowledged\r\n     himself the vassal of the Spanish king, but it is doubtful\r\n     whether he stooped so low before a distant enemy. Gomara,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 79, calls the present 1000 ropas and 1000\r\n     castellanos de oro, and Cortés says pesos de oro, which\r\n     doubtless means dust; but Bernal Diaz terms the latter gold\r\n     jewels worth that amount. Prescott confounds these presents\r\n     with a later gift, and assumes without good authority that\r\n     they came after Xicotencatl had brought in his submission.\r\n     Gomara on the other hand places their arrival on September\r\n     6, which must be altogether too early.\r\n\r\n     [323] ‘No les quiso dar luego la respuesta, porque estaua\r\n     purgado del dia antes,’ says Bernal Diaz, in explanation\r\n     of the delay. _Hist. Verdad._, 51. Brasseur de Bourbourg,\r\n     however, lets Cortés declare that the orders of his king\r\n     oblige him to disregard the wishes of the emperor. But the\r\n     general was too prudent to give an open rebuff ere he saw\r\n     how affairs would develop. According to Gomara he wished to\r\n     detain them to witness his prowess against the Tlascaltecs.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 79; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vi. cap. x.\r\n\r\n     [324] Ixtlilxochitl alone differs by stating that they were\r\n     headed by Tolinpanecatl Tlacatecuhtli the younger brother\r\n     of Xicotencatl; but he appears confused.\r\n\r\n     [325] Solis causes him to be dismissed from the office\r\n     of captain-general. _Hist. Mex._, i. 272-3. In _Carbajal\r\n     Espinosa_, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 154, is a portrait of him,\r\n     corresponding fairly to the description.\r\n\r\n     [326] It is generally accepted that the Tlascaltecs submitted\r\n     as vassals. Yet it is just as likely that they merely offered\r\n     their friendship and alliance, a relation which after the\r\n     conquest was changed into vassalage.\r\n\r\n     [327] According to Bernal Diaz the Tlascaltecs gave but one\r\n     present, and that at the capital, but some authors prefer\r\n     to bring it in here. ‘Le presentó cantidad de alpargatas\r\n     para el camino.’ _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 292;\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vi. cap. x.; _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 84-5; _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 66-7.\r\n\r\n     [328] _Herrera_, loc. cit.\r\n\r\n     [329] ‘Aun acordéme de una autoridad evangélica que dice:\r\n     _Omne regnum in seipsum divisum desolabitur_; y con los\r\n     unos y con los otros maneaba.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 70.\r\n     According to Ixtlilxochitl quite a quarrel sprang up between\r\n     the Mexican and Tlascalan representatives in the presence\r\n     of Cortés, attended by an exchange of epithets. _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 292.\r\n\r\n     [330] Cortés gives only his suspicions of the Tlascaltecs\r\n     as a reason for the delay, without referring to any\r\n     communication being sent to Mexico. _Cartas_, 67. Meanwhile\r\n     he wrote to Escalante at Villa Rica, informing him of\r\n     occurrences, and asking for a supply of holy wafers and\r\n     two bottles of wine, which speedily came. _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 51.\r\n\r\n     [331] After an absence of six days, six leading men came\r\n     from Mexico, who brought, beside the ten pieces of jewelry,\r\n     200 pieces of cloth. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 52.\r\n     The envoys who had been sent to Mexico came back on the\r\n     sixth day with ten beautifully wrought jewels of gold and\r\n     1500 pieces of cloth, far richer than the former. _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 85-6.\r\n\r\n     [332] ‘Todos los señores me vinieron á rogar.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 67. ‘Vinieron assi mismo todas las cabeçeras y\r\n     señores de Tlaxcallan a rogarle.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     86. Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 52, names five lords,\r\n     but the names are very confused, except Xicotencatl and\r\n     Maxixcatzin, which approach nearer to the usual form.\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl states that Cortés made it a condition that\r\n     the lords should come and ask him, whereupon they each\r\n     select two high representatives to proceed to the camp\r\n     and escort him to Tlascala. They were guided by the envoys\r\n     Tolinpanecatl and Costomatl, and brought a few jewels as\r\n     presents. _Hist. Chich._, 292-3. Nor does Camargo allow the\r\n     lords to go to the camp, but Costomatl and Tolinpanecatl\r\n     are sent. _Hist. Tlax._, 146.\r\n\r\n     [333] ‘Tocarõ las manos en el suelo, y besaron la tierra.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 52.\r\n\r\n     [334] _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._, 155. Maxixcatzin is put\r\n     forward by the Spanish writers as the principal lord, chiefly\r\n     perhaps because he was the most devoted to the conquerors,\r\n     but also because his quarter of Ocotelulco was the largest\r\n     and richest. Camargo and Ixtlilxochitl place Xicotencatl\r\n     first, and he certainly takes the lead in speaking and\r\n     in receiving the Spaniards at his palace. His age, which\r\n     Camargo raises into the hundred, may have had something to\r\n     do with this, however.\r\n\r\n     [335] Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 52, states that he\r\n     pleaded the want of carriers, which was not very plausible,\r\n     unless intended as a hint at Tlascaltec hospitality.\r\n\r\n     [336] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 67.\r\n\r\n     [337] Now Atoyac.\r\n\r\n     [338] Cortés proceeds to give an account of articles sold\r\n     here, which is on a par with his Granada comparison, and\r\n     accords little with the declared simplicity or poverty of the\r\n     people. In the temple over 800 persons had been sacrificed\r\n     during some years. _Peter Martyr_, dec. v. cap. ii.\r\n\r\n     [339] _Gomara_, _Hist.

Gomara, followed\r\n     by Herrera, says the 18th.\r\n\r\n     [341] ‘Se quitó la gorra y les hizo una muy grande y\r\n     humilde reverencia, y luego abrazó á Xicotencatl,’ says\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl, with an exactness which is doubtless intended\r\n     to impress the ruder Spanish population of his day. _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 293. Camargo also describes ceremonies with some\r\n     detail, _Hist. Tlax._, 147, and Duran, _Hist. Ind._, MS.,\r\n     ii. 425-7.\r\n\r\n     [342] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 86.

Verdad._, 53.\r\n\r\n     [346] According to the somewhat mixed account of Bernal\r\n     Diaz, Xicotencatl offers his daughter at once to Cortés,\r\n     who accepts, and thereupon urges Padre Olmedo to begin a\r\n     raid against idolatry. The latter tells him to wait till the\r\n     daughters are brought. They are introduced on the following\r\n     day, five in number, and Xicotencatl joins the hands of\r\n     the general with the one intended for him. He accepts her,\r\n     but declares that she and her companions must remain with\r\n     their parents till conversion is consummated. Finally the\r\n     daughter is transferred to Alvarado.\r\n\r\n     [347] A not uncommon practice in Mexico, carried out in\r\n     the same manner as among the Romans. See _Native Races_,\r\n     iii., passim.\r\n\r\n     [348] Portrait in _Carbajal Espinosa_, _Hist. Mex._, ii.\r\n     165, and _Zamacois_, _Hist.

A new temple near by was set aside for this. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 54. ‘Hizo la sala principal de\r\n     Xicotencatl Oratorio.’ _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist.

Doc._, ii. 572-3.\r\n     This author does not intimate that Cortés sought to force\r\n     conversion, Bernal Diaz alone being responsible for the\r\n     statement, though Herrera adopts it. Eager to remove the\r\n     reproach of infidelity from his people, Camargo relates\r\n     that Cortés insisted on the renunciation of idolatry, and\r\n     that the chiefs finally yielded, while placing upon him the\r\n     responsibility of removing the images. When the iconoclasm\r\n     began, the people hastened to hide their cherished idols,\r\n     which they long worshipped in secret, although accepting\r\n     baptism. _Hist. Tlax._, 150-8. In a hieroglyphic painting\r\n     still possessed by the cabildo, says Ixtlilxochitl, it is\r\n     shown that the lords were at this time baptized. He gives\r\n     their new names. _Hist.

Solis\r\n     dwells upon the spiritual effect of the miracle, which\r\n     occurred immediately after the departure from Tlascala.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, i. 324-5. Torquemada devotes a whole chapter\r\n     to it, and states that the first cross was raised by unseen\r\n     hands the night after the arrival of the Spaniards in\r\n     the city. The high-priest placed over it a guard, who was\r\n     surprised by a celestial light which appeared at midnight\r\n     and drove out the demon from the temple, iii. 200-3.\r\n\r\n     [351] ‘Lo primero que mandaua nuestro Capitan era quebralles\r\n     las tales carceles, y echar fuera los prisioneros.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 55.\r\n\r\n     [352] In order to obtain by them a race of heroes. Most\r\n     writers, following Bernal Diaz and the less explicit\r\n     chroniclers, allow Xicotencatl to give only one daughter,\r\n     but Ixtlilxochitl names two, _Hist. Chich._, 294. and\r\n     Juarros, in his biography of the Alvarados, enumerates\r\n     their different wives, and among them the two sisters, with\r\n     their full names and their descendants. Pedro de Alvarado’s\r\n     only surviving issue, he says, was a daughter Leonor, by\r\n     Luisa, who married first Pedro Puertocarrero and afterward\r\n     Francisco de la Cueva, nephew of the Duke of Alburquerque.\r\n     The other sister also left a daughter. _Hist. Guat._,\r\n     347-8. Bernal Diaz mentions also a son, Pedro, by Luisa.\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 54; _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 54.\r\n     According to Camargo, 300 young and pretty slave girls,\r\n     destined for the sacrifices, were the first women offered.\r\n     They were at first declined, but finally accepted for\r\n     the suite of Marina. Finding that they were well treated,\r\n     the lords offered their own daughters in marriage. _Hist.\r\n     Tlax._, 148-50. A number of women were added to the suite\r\n     of Marina and of the new wives, from the first families in\r\n     the state, another authority intimates. _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 86; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vi. cap. xi.\r\n\r\n     [353] _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._, 150-1. They opened a road\r\n     to Cempoala, and brought effects from Villa Rica, including\r\n     presents for the lords. _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 294.\r\n\r\n     [354] Tapia writes, ‘Yo que esto escribo pregunté á\r\n     Muteczuma y á otros sus capitanes,’ and was told that\r\n     the Mexicans could readily have subdued little Tlascala,\r\n     but they preferred to use her as a means, close at hand,\r\n     for exercising their youth and armies in warfare, and for\r\n     supplying war captives for the sacrifices! _Tapia_, _Rel._,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 572. ‘Juntaua dozientos y\r\n     trezientos mil hombres para vna batalla.’ _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 89. The Tlascaltecs spoke of their descent from\r\n     giants, and produced gigantic bones in evidence thereof.\r\n     Some of these were sent to Spain by Cortés, together with\r\n     the report. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 55.\r\n\r\n     [355] Torquemada places the arrival of this embassy\r\n     immediately after Cortés’ entry into Tlascala, _Monarq.\r\n     Ind._, i. 433, while Clavigero dates it at Tecohuatzinco.\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 51-2. Brasseur de Bourbourg calls\r\n     it the second embassy, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 165, for he\r\n     accepts the statement of Ixtlilxochitl, _Hist. Chich._, 288,\r\n     that the first envoys saw Cortés at his camp by San Juan\r\n     de Ulua. For Ixtlilxochitl’s career, see _Native Races_,\r\n     v. 474-7.\r\n\r\n     [356] Bernal Diaz relates that Cortés detained these men\r\n     as hostages, while he sent Alvarado and Bernardino Vazquez\r\n     de Tapia to Mexico to communicate with Montezuma, and to\r\n     examine the route and approaches to the city. They had hardly\r\n     left before the company began to censure the rashness of\r\n     sending two valuable men on so risky a mission, and Cortés\r\n     accordingly sent to recall them. Tapia having fallen sick\r\n     on the road, they gladly returned, but left the guides to\r\n     proceed to Mexico.\r\n\r\n     [357] ‘Me dijeron ... que para ello habia enviado Muteczuma\r\n     de su tierra ... cincuenta mil hombres, y que los tenia en\r\n     guarnicion á dos leguas de la dicha ciudad ... é que tenian\r\n     cerrado el camino real por donde solian ir, y hecho otro\r\n     nuevo de muchos hoyos, y palos agudos hincados y encubiertos\r\n     para que los caballos cayesen y se mancasen, y que tenian\r\n     muchas de las calles tapiadas, y por las azoteas de las\r\n     casas muchas piedras.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 70. The stream\r\n     within the temple was a myth, which the Cholultecs sought\r\n     to maintain in order to frighten their enemies. Oviedo\r\n     and Gomara relate that Xicotencatl junior was concerned\r\n     in these plots, and that, warned by his sister, the wife\r\n     of Alvarado, Cortés had him quietly seized and choked to\r\n     death, iii. 497; _Hist. Mex._, 90. Whoever may have been\r\n     throttled, it certainly was not the general, for he met\r\n     his fate at a later date. According to Bernal Diaz the\r\n     whole army was consulted as to whether all were prepared\r\n     to start for Mexico. Many of those owning estates in Cuba\r\n     raised objections, but Cortés firmly declared that there\r\n     was no other way open than the one to Mexico, and so they\r\n     yielded. _Hist. Verdad._, 56.\r\n\r\n     [358] ‘Y dar la obediencia â nuestro Rey, y Señor, sino\r\n     que los ternia por de malas intenciones.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist Verdad._, 56. According to Camargo, Patlahuatzin of\r\n     Tlascala was sent with the message. The Cholultecs seized\r\n     and flayed his face and arms, cutting off the hands, so that\r\n     they were left dangling by the skin from the neck. In this\r\n     guise they sent him back with the reply that thus would they\r\n     receive the white gods whose prowess he had extolled. The\r\n     Tlascaltecs demanded that Cortés should avenge the cruelty\r\n     and the insult, and he did so in the massacre of Cholula.\r\n     This, continues the narrator, is commemorated in Tlascalan\r\n     song, but the account is evidently mixed, and probably\r\n     refers chiefly to some earlier occurrence. _Hist. Tlax._,\r\n     161-2. Brasseur de Bourbourg assumes that Patlahuatzin is\r\n     merely insulted and ill-treated. The two peoples had once\r\n     been friends and allies, but during the last battle which\r\n     they fought against their common enemy, the Aztecs, the\r\n     Cholultecs had suddenly changed sides and fallen on the rear\r\n     of their unsuspecting allies, inflicting great slaughter.\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vi. cap. xviii.\r\n\r\n     [359] Three of the members are imprisoned for favoring an\r\n     alliance with the Spaniards, but they escape and come to\r\n     Cortés, says Herrera, _Id._\r\n\r\n     [360] Cortés, _Cartas_, 71, says that he sent this message\r\n     by the Cholultec messengers.\r\n\r\n     [361] ‘É así lo asentó un escribano.’ _Id._, 72. ‘Otro dia\r\n     vinieron muchos señores y capitanes de Chololla.’ _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 91. According to Brasseur de Bourbourg,\r\n     Cortés is already en route for Cholula when the friendly\r\n     council members appear to bring excuses and invitations.\r\n     _Hist. Nat.

Cortés did not think it well,\r\nhowever, to trammel his movements, or to intrude on his various hosts\r\nwith too large a force of undisciplined and unmanageable men, whom he\r\nhad not learned to trust, and only about five thousand were allowed\r\nto attach themselves to his army.[364]\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the army reached the southern border of Tlascala,\r\nand camped by a river two leagues from Cholula. The city stood in a\r\nvast fertile plain, so thickly covered with plantations and gardens\r\n“that not a span of land remained uncultivated.” A network of ditches\r\nirrigated the fields wherein maize and agave, cochineal and chile,\r\nswelled the resources of the owners. “No city in Spain,” exclaims\r\nCortés, “presents a more beautiful exterior, with its even surface\r\nand mass of towers,” interspersed with charming gardens and fringed\r\nwith alluring groves. Its six sections were marked by fine, straight\r\nstreets, lined with buildings, the neatness and substantial appearance\r\nof which fully corresponded to the reputed wealth of the occupants.\r\nCortés estimates the number of houses at twenty thousand, with as\r\nmany more in the suburbs, which implies a population of two hundred\r\nthousand.[365]\r\n\r\nCholula was one of the most ancient settlements in the country, with\r\ntraditions reaching far back into the misty past. It was here that\r\nQuetzalcoatl had left the final impress of his golden age as ruler\r\nand prophet, and here that a grateful people had raised to him the\r\ngrandest of his many temples, erected upon the ruins of a tower of\r\nBabel which had been stayed in its growth by divine interference.\r\nNotwithstanding the vicissitudes of war, during which the frenzy of\r\nthe moment had overcome religious scruples to wreak destruction, or\r\nduring which reckless invaders less imbued with veneration came to\r\ndesecrate this western Rome, she had maintained herself, ever rising\r\nfrom the ashes with renewed vigor and fresh splendor, and she was at\r\nthis time the commercial centre for the great Huitzilapan plateau,\r\nfamous beside for her pottery and delicate fabrics. The warlike\r\nTlascaltecs referred to her contemptuously as a city of cunning and\r\neffeminate traders, and there was doubtless a good deal of truth in\r\nthis; but then her merchants rivalled those of Mexico in wealth, while\r\nher citizens were not behind the dwellers on the lake in refinement.\r\n\r\nBut the chief renown of Cholula consisted in being the holy city of\r\nAnáhuac, unequalled for the frequency and pomp of her festivals and\r\nsacred pageantry; in being the religious centre for countless pilgrims\r\nwho journeyed from afar to worship at the shrines here maintained,\r\nnot only by the citizens, but by princes of different countries. Her\r\ntemples were estimated to equal the number of days in the year, and as\r\nsome possessed more than one chapel, fully four hundred towers rose\r\nto bewilder the eye with their gleaming ornamentation. Chief among\r\nthem was the semispherical temple, with its vestal fire, devoted to\r\nQuetzalcoatl, which stood upon a quadrilateral mound of nearly two\r\nhundred feet in height, ascended by one hundred and twenty steps,\r\nand with a larger base than any old-world pyramid.[366]\r\n\r\nThe government was aristocratic republican, directed by a council of\r\nsix nobles, elected in the six wards. At their head sat two supreme\r\nmagistrates, the _tlachiach_ and _aquiach_, chosen respectively\r\nfrom the priesthood and nobility, and corresponding to pontiff\r\nand captain-general,[367] the latter office held at this time by\r\nTecuanhuehuetzin.[368]\r\n\r\nAt the command of these chiefs a number of Cholultec nobles appeared\r\nat the camp to offer welcome and to bring provisions.[369] In the\r\nmorning the army advanced toward the city and was met by a crowd\r\nof fully ten thousand people, preceded by a stately procession, at\r\nthe head of which appeared the lords. They showed themselves most\r\nobsequious, but requested that the Tlascaltecs, as their enemies,\r\nshould not be allowed to enter the city, and Cortés accordingly\r\npersuaded these warriors to camp outside. Some of their carriers\r\nalone entered with the Cempoalans and Spaniards to receive a share in\r\nthe proffered hospitality. If the troops found no arches and floral\r\nfestoons, as at Tlascala, to honor them, nor the same jubilant shouts\r\nof welcome, they were at least heralded by clashing music, and dense\r\ncrowds of spectators lined the streets and roofs, while priests in\r\nwhite robes went chanting by their side, swinging the censers whence\r\nthe copal rose to shed a halo on the heroes. Cortés was struck with\r\nthe superior quality and quantity of dresses worn, the higher classes\r\nbeing noticeable in their embroidered mantles, not unlike the Moorish\r\ncloak. He also observed that beggars abounded, as they did in “Spain\r\nand other parts inhabited by civilized people.”\r\n\r\nThe courts of one of the temples[370] were offered as quarters for\r\nthe army, and presently servants appeared with provisions, which, if\r\nnot abundant, were at least good.[371] Cortés did not omit to vaunt\r\nthe grandeur of his king and to impress the advantages of the true\r\nfaith, but although the lords bowed admission to the first they held\r\nfirmly to their idols. The following day they failed to appear, and the\r\nsupply of food dwindled perceptibly, while none was furnished on the\r\nthird day, the populace even appearing to avoid the Spanish quarters.\r\nCortés sent to remind the chiefs of their neglect, but received only\r\nthe scantiest provisions, with the excuse that the stock was nearly\r\nexhausted.[372]\r\n\r\nThe same day came envoys from Montezuma, unprovided with the usual\r\npresents, who, after some words with the confrères acting as guides to\r\nthe Spaniards, represented that to proceed to Mexico would be useless,\r\nsince the roads were impassable and the food supply insufficient.[373]\r\nFinding that these and other statements had no effect on Cortés,\r\nthey left, taking with them the leading envoy stationed with the\r\nSpaniards.[374] All this was far from reassuring, taken in connection\r\nwith the warning of the Tlascaltecs still ringing in their ears, and\r\nwith the report brought by Cempoalans of barricades, of stone piles\r\nupon the roofs, and of excavations in the main street set with pointed\r\nsticks and loosely covered over.[375]\r\n\r\nNow came messengers from the allied camp to announce that women\r\nand children had been leaving the city with their effects, and that\r\nunusual preparations seemed to be going on. Scarcely had this set\r\nCortés pondering when Marina appeared with the still more startling\r\ninformation that a native woman of rank, won by her beauty and evident\r\nwealth no doubt, had just been urging her in a most mysterious manner\r\nto transfer herself and her effects to the house of the woman, where\r\nshe should be married to her son.[376] By expressing gratitude and\r\npretending acquiescence, Marina elicited that envoys had been coming\r\nand going between Mexico and Cholula for some time, and that Montezuma\r\nhad prevailed on the chiefs, by means of bribes and promises,[377] to\r\nattack the Spaniards that very night or in the morning. Aztec troops\r\nwere stationed close to the city, to the number of twenty or even\r\nfifty thousand, to aid in the work and to carry the Mexican share\r\nof the captives to their capital.[378] Cortés at once secured the\r\ncommunicative woman, who was awaiting the return of Marina with her\r\nvaluables, and ascertained further that the covered excavations, the\r\nstone piles, and the barricades were no fiction.\r\n\r\nHe also secured two apparently friendly priests,[379] and by bribing\r\nthem with chalchiuite stones, and showing that he was aware of the\r\nplot, obtained a revelation which agreed substantially with the account\r\nalready given. It appeared that Montezuma had proposed to quarter\r\nhis troops in the city, but this the lords had objected to, fearing\r\nthat once within the walls the Aztecs would retain possession.[380]\r\nThe Cholultecs intended to do the deed themselves, and it was only\r\nin case the Spaniards left the city, or escaped, that the confederate\r\nAztecs were to take an active part.\r\n\r\nOnly three of the wards had consented to share in the treachery,[381]\r\nand the priests of the others had that very day sacrificed ten\r\nchildren[382] to the god of war, and received assurances of victory.\r\nSo confident were they of securing the encaged guests that ropes and\r\nstakes had been prepared to bind the captives.\r\n\r\nCortés called his counsellors, and placing before them the state of\r\naffairs asked their views. A few of the more cautious advised retreat\r\nto Tlascala, whose friendly hospitality seemed alluring. Others\r\nsuggested an immediate departure by way of the friendly Huexotzinco,\r\nwhile the majority inclined to a prompt and effective chastisement\r\nof the treachery as a warning to others. This was what Cortés had\r\ndetermined upon. He showed them how well the arrangement of the courts\r\nwould answer for the plan he had evolved, and how strong they were\r\nin case of a siege.\r\n\r\nSummoning the lords, he expressed his displeasure at the inconsiderate\r\ntreatment received, and said that he would rid them of his presence\r\non the morrow. He reminded them of the allegiance they had tendered,\r\nand declared that if loyal they would be rewarded; if not, punishment\r\nwould follow. Finally he demanded provisions for the journey, and\r\ntwo thousand warriors, beside carriers, to accompany the army.[383]\r\nThis appeared to suit their plans, for they exchanged a look of\r\nintelligence, and at once promised compliance, protesting at the same\r\ntime their devotion. “What need have these of food,” they muttered\r\nwith a laugh, “when they themselves are soon to be eaten cooked with\r\nchile?”[384] That very night preparations were made, the Spaniards\r\nplanting guns at the approaches to the streets and courts, looking to\r\nthe horses and accoutrements, and sending a message to the Tlascaltecs\r\nto enter the city and join them on hearing the first shot.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, so early indeed as to indicate a decided eagerness,\r\ncame the lords and leading priests, with an immense throng. A force\r\neven larger than had been demanded followed them into the Spanish\r\nquarter, and was allowed to file into the court, which was commanded\r\nat all points by the soldiers and the cannon, the latter as yet\r\ninnocent-looking instruments to the Cholultecs.[385] The lords and\r\nleading men, to the number of thirty or forty, were invited to Cortés’\r\nrooms to receive his farewell. He addressed them in a severe tone,\r\nin the presence of the Aztec envoys, representing that he had sought\r\nto win their friendship for himself and their adhesion for his king,\r\nand to further this he had treated them with every consideration.\r\nThey had withheld the necessary supplies, yet he had respected their\r\nproperty and persons, and for their sake he had left his stanch allies\r\noutside the city. In return for this they had, under the mask of\r\nfriendship, plotted against the lives of his party, the invited guests\r\nof themselves and of Montezuma, with the intention of assassinating\r\nthem. But they had been caught in their own trap. The amazement of the\r\nchiefs deepened into terror as he concluded. “Surely it is a god that\r\nspeaks,” they murmured, “since he reads our very thoughts.” On the\r\nimpulse of the moment they admitted their guilt, but cast the blame\r\non Montezuma. This, rejoined Cortés, did not justify treachery, and\r\nthe excuse should avail them naught. The lords who had been opposed\r\nto the plot, and a few others less guilty or less responsible chiefs\r\nand priests, were now taken aside, and from them further particulars\r\nwere obtained, which implicated the Mexicans only the more.\r\n\r\nReturning to the envoys, who protested that their emperor was wholly\r\nblameless, he reassured them by saying that he believed not a word\r\nof the accusation. Montezuma was too great a prince, he continued,\r\nto stoop to such baseness, and had beside, by means of presents\r\nand messages, shown himself to be his friend. The Cholultecs should\r\nsuffer the penalty not only of their treason but of their falsehood.\r\nThe fact was that it did not suit Cortés to quarrel with Montezuma\r\nfor the present, but rather to lull him into fancied security.[386]\r\nA terrible punishment was now in store for the Cholultecs.\r\n\r\nThe signal being given, volleys poured from cannon, arquebuses, and\r\ncross-bows upon the warriors confined in the court, and then the\r\nSpaniards rushed in with sword and lance thrusting and slashing at\r\nthe packed masses. The high walls permitted no escape, and at the\r\ngates gleamed a line of lances above the smoking mouths of the guns.\r\nPressing one upon another, the victims offered only a better mark for\r\nthe ruthless slayers, and fell in heaps, dead and dying intermingled,\r\nwhile many were trampled underfoot. Not one of those who had entered\r\nthe court remained standing. Among the slain were the captain-general\r\nand the most inimical of the lords and leading men.[387]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other guns had belched destruction along the approaches from\r\nthe streets, as the crowd rushed forward in response to the cries and\r\ngroans of their butchered friends. Terrified by the fiery thunder and\r\nits mysterious missiles, they fell back; and now the cavalry charged,\r\ntrampling them underfoot, and opening a way for the infantry and\r\nallies, who pressed onward to take advantage of the confusion and\r\nto repeat the scene enacted within. Panic-stricken as the natives\r\nwere by the strange arms and tactics of the Spaniards, they offered\r\nlittle or no resistance, though armed with intent to attack. Being\r\nalso without leaders, they had none to restrain their flight, but\r\npressed one on the other, down the streets and into buildings, anywhere\r\nout of the reach of the cutting blades and fierce-tramping horses.\r\nThe Tlascaltecs[388] were at the same time falling on their flanks,\r\nglorying in the opportunity to repay their enemies the treachery of\r\nyears ago. A bloody track they left. Unprepared for such an onslaught\r\nthe people of Cholula found little opportunity to make use of the\r\nbarricades and the stone piles, and where they attempted it the\r\nfire-arm and cross-bow aided the fire-brand. The strongest resistance\r\nwas met at the temples, wherein the fugitives mostly gathered, but\r\neven these did not hold out long, for stones and arrows availed little\r\nagainst armor.\r\n\r\nAll who could sought to gain the great temple of Quetzalcoatl, which\r\noffered not only the best defence from its height, but was held to\r\nbe impregnable through the special protection extended over it by the\r\ndeity. Within its walls lay confined a mighty stream, so it was said,\r\nwhich by the removal of a few stones could be let loose to overwhelm\r\ninvaders. Now, if ever, in the name of all the gods, let it be done!\r\nReverently were removed, one by one, the stones of the sacred wall,\r\nbut no flood appeared, not even a drop of water. In their despair\r\nthe besieged hastened to hurl the stones, and arrows, and darts[389]\r\nupon the enemy as they climbed the sides of the pyramid. But there\r\nwas little use in this. Quickly they were driven by the sword from\r\nthe platform into the chapel tower. Not caring to lose time in a\r\nsiege, the Spaniards offered them their lives. One alone is said to\r\nhave surrendered. The rest, inspired by the presence of the idols,\r\nspat defiance. It was their last effort, for the next moment the\r\ntorch was applied, and enfolding the building, the flames drove the\r\nbesieged, frenzied with terror and excitement, upon the line of pikes\r\ninclosing them, or head-foremost down the dizzy heights. To the last\r\ncould be seen a priest upon the highest pinnacle, enveloped in smoke\r\nand glare, declaiming against the idols for having abandoned them,\r\nand shouting: “Now, Tlascala, thy heart has its revenge! Speedily\r\nshall Montezuma have his!”[390]\r\n\r\nDuring the first two hours of the slaughter over three thousand\r\nmen perished, if we may believe Cortés, and for three hours more\r\nhe continued the carnage, raising the number of deaths according to\r\ndifferent estimates to six thousand or more.[391] The loss of life\r\nwould have been still greater but for the strict orders issued to\r\nspare the women and children, and also the less hostile wards,[392]\r\nand for the eagerness of the Tlascaltecs to secure captives as well\r\nas spoils, and of the Spaniards to hunt for treasures. The hostile\r\nwards had besides been pretty well cleared of inhabitants by the time\r\nCortés returned to his quarters forbidding further butchery. When the\r\namnesty was proclaimed, however, numbers appeared from hiding-places,\r\neven from beneath the heaps of slain, while many who had pretended\r\ndeath, to escape the sword, arose and fled.\r\n\r\nThe pillage was continued for some time longer,[393] and as the\r\nTlascaltecs cared chiefly for fabrics, feathers, and provisions,\r\nparticularly salt, the Spaniards were allowed to secure all the gold\r\nand trinkets they could, though these were far less in amount than had\r\nbeen expected.[394] When the real work was over, Xicotencatl appeared\r\nwith twenty thousand men and tendered his services; but Cortés could\r\noffer him only a share in the booty for his attention, and with this\r\nhe returned to Tlascala to celebrate the downfall of the hated and\r\nboastful neighbor.[395]\r\n\r\nThe prayers of the chiefs who had been spared, supported by the\r\nneighboring caciques, and even by the Tlascalan lords, prevailed on\r\nCortés to stop the pillage after the second day, and to issue a pardon,\r\nalthough not till everything of value had been secured. Some of the\r\nchiefs were thereupon sent forth to recall the fugitive inhabitants,\r\nand with such good effect that within a few days the city was again\r\npeopled. The débris and gore being removed, the streets speedily\r\nresumed their accustomed appearance, and the shops and markets were\r\nbusy as before, though blackened ruins and desolated homes long\r\nremained a testimony of the fearful blow.[396] Impressed no less by\r\nthe supposed divine penetration of the white conquerors than by their\r\nirresistible prowess and terrible revenge, the natives were only too\r\nready to kiss with veneration the hand red with the blood of their\r\nkindred. To this they were also impelled by finding that the Spaniards\r\nnot only allowed no sacrifice of captives, but ordered the Tlascaltecs\r\nto release the prisoners they had hoped to carry into slavery. This\r\nwas a most trying requirement to the allies, but at the instance of\r\nMaxixcatzin and other lords they obeyed in so far as to restore the\r\ngreater proportion of the thousands who had been secured.\r\n\r\nThe intervention of the Tlascaltec lords and chiefs in behalf of the\r\nCholultecs tended to promote a more friendly feeling between the two\r\npeoples, particularly since the one had been satiated with revenue\r\nand the other humbled, and Cortés took advantage of this to formally\r\nreconcile them. Whatever may have been their sincerity in the matter,\r\nthey certainly found no opportunity to renew their feud.\r\n\r\nThe captain-general having fallen, the people, with Cortés’ approval,\r\nchose a successor from the ranks of the friendly chiefs.[397] Cortés\r\nassured them of his goodwill and protection so long as they remained\r\nthe loyal subjects they now promised to be, and he hoped that nothing\r\nwould occur hereafter to mar their friendly intercourse. He explained\r\nto them the mysteries of his faith, and its superiority over the\r\nsuperstitious worship of the idols which had played them false during\r\nthe late conflict, counselling them to cast aside such images, and let\r\ntheir place be occupied by the redeeming emblems of Christianity. The\r\nterrified natives could only promise obedience, and hasten to aid in\r\nerecting crosses, but the idols nevertheless retained their places.\r\nCortés was quite prepared to take advantage of his power as conqueror\r\nto compel the acceptance of his doctrines by the now humbled people,\r\nbut Padre Olmedo representing the futility of enforced conversion, he\r\ncontented himself with breaking the sacrificial cages and forbidding\r\nthe offering of human victims. As it was, idolatry had suffered a\r\nheavy blow in this terrible chastisement of the holy city, rich as\r\nshe was in her sanctuaries and profound in her devotion. The gods\r\nhad proved powerless! Although a number of temples were speedily\r\nrestored to their worship, the great pyramid was never again to be\r\ngraced by pagan rites. Twice had this temple shared in the destruction\r\nof the city, only to rise more beautiful than ever in its delusive\r\nattractions; now a simple stone cross stood upon the summit, erected\r\nby Cortés to guard the site on behalf of the church which was there\r\nto rise a few years later. This was dedicated to the Vírgen de los\r\nRemedios, whose image is said to have been left in the city by her\r\nconquerors.[398]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe massacre of Cholula forms one of the darkest pages in the annals\r\nof the conquest, and has afforded much ground for reproach against\r\nCortés, but it is to be regarded from different stand-points.\r\nThe diabolical doctrines of the day may be said to have forced on\r\nadventurers in America the conquest of her nations, and cruel deeds\r\nwere but the natural result, particularly when the task was undertaken\r\nwith insufficient forces. According to their own admission, made also\r\nbefore the later investigating committee, the Cholultecs had plotted\r\nto destroy their invited guests, whom they sought first to lull into\r\nfancied security, and in this they acted as treacherously and plotted\r\nas cruelly as did their intended victims in retaliating. True, they\r\nhad been forced by threats, and by the exhibition of an apparently\r\nsuperior force, into a submission which they could ill brook, and were\r\njustified in striking a blow for liberty, especially when encouraged,\r\nor bidden, by the great monarch; but they had no right to complain\r\nif they suffered the penalty everywhere affixed to treachery; and\r\nthe Cholultecs did bear an unenviable reputation in this respect.\r\nThe native records naturally assert their innocence; but even if we\r\nignore the confession of the Indians, as prompted by fear of their\r\njudges and masters, or as colored by Franciscans whose patron Cortés\r\nwas, and if we disregard all official testimony, we must still admit\r\nthat there was evidence enough to justify the general in a measure\r\nwhich he regarded as necessary for the safety of his men.[399]\r\n\r\nIt might be claimed that by holding captive the chiefs their safety\r\nwould have been assured; but treason was rife everywhere, and a lesson\r\nwas needed. Here among the greatest plotters, and in the holy city,\r\nthe lesson would be most effective. It might also be claimed that\r\nthe chiefs were the guilty ones, and should alone have suffered,\r\nnot the citizens and soldiers; but they were also in arms, even if\r\nsubordinate, and such discrimination is not observed in our own age.\r\n\r\nOutrages equally as cruel are to-day exculpated throughout Christendom\r\nas exigencies of war. If we, then, overlook such deeds, how much more\r\nexcusable are they in the more bloody times of Cortés? But neither now\r\nnor then can war, with any of its attendant atrocities, be regarded by\r\nright-thinking, humane men as aught but beastly, horrible, diabolical.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [362] ‘Hiço sacrificar treynta muchachos el dia que se\r\n     partieron.’ _Oviedo_, iii. 497.\r\n\r\n     [363] Estimated by Cortés at around 100,000.

Doc._, ii. 574;\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 92.\r\n\r\n     [374] Cortés told them to wait, for he would start for\r\n     Mexico on the following day, and they promised to do so,\r\n     says Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 58.\r\n\r\n     [375] On his entry into the city Cortés also observed\r\n     suspicious features. ‘Algunas calles de la ciudad tapiadas,\r\n     y muchas piedras en todas las azoteas.’ _Cartas_, 72.\r\n\r\n     [376] ‘Hermano de otro moço que traia la vieja que la\r\n     acompañaua.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 59. This is\r\n     probably the young man who, according to Peter Martyr,\r\n     reveals the plot to Aguilar. A ‘Cempoal maiden’ was also\r\n     warned by a Cholultec woman, dec. v. cap. ii.\r\n\r\n     [377] ‘Dieron al capitan-general vn atambor de oro.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 92. This official was the husband\r\n     of the old woman. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 59.\r\n\r\n     [378] ‘Auian de quedar veinte de nosotros para sacrificar\r\n     á los idolos de Cholula.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     59. Others say half the captives.\r\n\r\n     [379] Marina won them over. _Id._ ‘Dos que andauan muy\r\n     solicitos.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vii. cap. i. Brasseur\r\n     de Bourbourg supposes that the friendly chiefs were those\r\n     who gave the first intimation of the plot, _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 174, and it is not unlikely that they did warn\r\n     the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n     [380] Oviedo regards the Cholultecs as having rebelled\r\n     against Montezuma, iii. 498. But they stood rather in the\r\n     position of allies. See _Native Races_, v. Bernal Diaz\r\n     assumes that half the Aztec troops were admitted.\r\n\r\n     [381] ‘Los Mexicanos ... trataron con los Señores de los\r\n     Tres Barrios.’ _Torquemada_, i. 438. Herrera has been even\r\n     more explicit, and Bernal Diaz confirms this in several\r\n     places, without specifying the number. ‘Otros barrios, que\r\n     no se hallaron en las traiciones.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 60.\r\n\r\n     [382] Three years old, half males, half females. _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. vii. cap. ii. Oviedo supposes the females to\r\n     be young virgins, iii. 498. Bernal Diaz says five children\r\n     and two other persons.\r\n\r\n     [383] Most authors, following Gomara and Herrera, assume that\r\n     only carriers were asked for, but Diaz writes warriors, and\r\n     correctly, no doubt, since it could not be Cortés’ plan or\r\n     desire to wreak vengeance on helpless carriers, but rather\r\n     on the very men who proposed to attack him. According to\r\n     Tapia, followed by Gomara, Cortés upbraids the lords for\r\n     lying and plotting, but they assure him of their loyalty.\r\n     _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 575. It is not\r\n     likely that he would have roused suspicion by such language.\r\n\r\n     [384] ‘Aguilar que los oya hablar.’ _Oviedo_, iii. 498.\r\n\r\n     [385] Picked warriors were brought, pretending to be slaves\r\n     and carriers. _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, ii. 575. ‘Cõ hamacas para lleuar los Españoles.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 93.\r\n\r\n     [386] According to Bernal Diaz the envoys are told of this\r\n     on the preceding evening, and are thereupon placed under\r\n     guard. _Hist. Verdad._, 59.\r\n\r\n     [387] Tapia states that most of the lords and chiefs whom\r\n     Cortés addressed were killed. _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, ii. 575. ‘Some of them,’ say Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     and Gomara, while Clavigero, Brasseur de Bourbourg, and\r\n     others suppose that all these leaders were pardoned, which\r\n     is not likely, since so many less guilty men fell. ‘El\r\n     que solia mãdar, fue vno de los que murieron en el patio.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 60. He intimates that the\r\n     real carriers were allowed to leave the court, the warriors\r\n     alone being detained for slaughter. The two friendly priests\r\n     were sent home to be out of harm’s way. This leads to the\r\n     supposition that all the rest of the leading men fell. ‘Los\r\n     otros señores naturales todos murieron.’ _Oviedo_, iii. 499.\r\n\r\n     [388] Wearing crowns of rushes to be distinguished from\r\n     their enemies. _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._, 164.\r\n\r\n     [389] Zamacois enters into an elaborate argument to disprove\r\n     the unimportant statement that burning arrows were showered\r\n     on the besiegers. _Hist. Méj._, ii. 707. This author has a\r\n     decided faculty for singling out trifles, apparently under\r\n     the impression that important questions can take care of\r\n     themselves.\r\n\r\n     [390] _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._, 163-4; _Torquemada_, i. 440.\r\n     ‘Se dejaron allí quemar.’ _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, ii. 576.\r\n\r\n     [391] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 73-4; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 94;\r\n     6000 and more within two hours. _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 294. Las Casas lets him first kill 6000 unarmed\r\n     carriers and then proceed to devastate the city. _Regio.\r\n     Ind. Devastat._, 27.\r\n\r\n     [392] ‘Eché toda la gente fuera de la ciudad por muchas\r\n     partes della.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 74. The statement of\r\n     Bernal Diaz that the friendly priests were sent home, to be\r\n     out of harm’s way, shows also that parts of the city were\r\n     respected. See notes 17 and 23. ‘El marques mandaba que se\r\n     guardasen de no matar mujeres ni niños.’ _Tapia_, _Rel._,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 576.\r\n\r\n     [393] For two days, says Tapia, _Id._, and Bernal Diaz\r\n     intimates that it ended with the second day. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     60.\r\n\r\n     [394] ‘Tomaron los Castellanos el oro, y pluma, aũque se\r\n     halló poco.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vii. cap. ii. ‘Ovo\r\n     mucho despojo de oro é plata,’ says Oviedo, iii. 499,\r\n     probably because he knew Cholula to be rich; but a great\r\n     deal of private treasure at least must have been taken out\r\n     of the city when the women were sent away. The Tlascaltecs\r\n     carried off 20,000 captives, he adds.\r\n\r\n     [395] _Herrera_, ubi sup. Oviedo allows a reinforcement of\r\n     40,000 Tlascaltecs to join in the massacre and pillage,\r\n     iii. 498, and Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 60, says the\r\n     late comers joined in the pillage on the second day. The\r\n     Tlascaltecs brought the Spaniards food, of which they had\r\n     fallen short. _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 295.\r\n\r\n     [396] A very similar massacre and raid was perpetrated\r\n     by the Chichimec-Toltecs at the close of the thirteenth\r\n     century. _Native Races_, v. 484-7.\r\n\r\n     [397] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 95. Finding that the brother\r\n     of the deceased was, according to custom, entitled to the\r\n     office, Cortés appointed him. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     60. Oviedo intimates that one governor was chosen to take\r\n     the place of all the other ruling men. iii. 499.\r\n\r\n     [398] It is also said ‘que la trajo un religioso franciscano\r\n     á quien se le apareció en Roma.’ _Veytia_, _Hist. Ant.\r\n     Méj._, i. 156. ‘Disgusted with the idol which had played\r\n     them false, they installed another in its place,’ says\r\n     Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 61. The disregard shown by\r\n     Spaniards even for the temples and relics of Quetzalcoatl\r\n     might have struck the natives as peculiar in men whom rumor\r\n     pointed out as his descendants, yet no chronicle refers to\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     [399] Spanish chroniclers as a rule approve the deed as\r\n     necessary and just, either in tacit or open comment, and\r\n     a few devout missionaries, who have assumed the rank of\r\n     Indian apostles, are the only ones to take exception. Chief\r\n     among these stands Las Casas, as might be expected from his\r\n     sympathy with Velazquez, and from his character as Indian\r\n     protector. He condemns it in the most unmeasured terms as\r\n     a base murder of innocent and defenceless people, committed\r\n     merely with a view to spread terror. Six thousand carriers,\r\n     he writes, were shut up in a court and put to the sword,\r\n     while the many discovered alive on the following days\r\n     were thrust through and through. The chiefs of the city\r\n     and neighborhood, to the number of over 100, were chained\r\n     together to a circle of poles and burned alive, and the\r\n     king, who fled with 30 or 40 followers to a temple, met\r\n     the same fate there. While the soldiers were butchering\r\n     and roasting the captives, ‘eorum Capitaneum summa lætitia\r\n     perfusum in hunc cantum prorupisse:\r\n\r\n               Monte ex Tarpeio Romana incendia spectans\r\n               Ipse Nero planctus vidit, nec corde movetur.’\r\n\r\n     _Las Casas_, _Regio. Ind. Devastat._, 26-8. A number of\r\n     finely executed copper plates are appended to illustrate\r\n     these deeds.\r\n\r\n     Bernal Diaz expresses himself hotly against this version,\r\n     and states that several of the first Franciscans who came\r\n     to Mexico held an investigation at Cholula of the massacre.\r\n     After examining the leaders, and other persons who had\r\n     witnessed it, they came to the conclusion that the story\r\n     of the conquerors was true, and that the slaughter was\r\n     a well merited punishment for a plot which involved the\r\n     lives of Cortés’ soldiers, and would, if successful, have\r\n     stayed the conquest for God and the king. Diaz had heard\r\n     the pious Motolinia say that although he grieved over the\r\n     deed, yet, being done, it was best so, since it exposed the\r\n     lies and wickedness of the idols. _Hist. Verdad._, 61. The\r\n     Franciscans did not probably care to weigh carefully the\r\n     value of testimony from new converts given before a tribunal\r\n     composed of their religious and political masters, nor\r\n     were they likely to favor a Dominican friar like Las Casas\r\n     when the interest of their patron Cortés was at stake. In\r\n     awe of the friars, and in terror of the conquerors whose\r\n     encomienda slaves they were, the Indians hardly dared to\r\n     say aught to implicate the latter. This is doubtless the\r\n     view Las Casas would have taken. Intent on pleading the\r\n     cause of his dusky protégés, he cared not to sift statements\r\n     that might create sympathy for them. Yet, had he foreseen\r\n     how widely his accusations would be used to sully Spanish\r\n     fame, he might have been more circumspect. ‘E’ vero, che\r\n     fu troppo rigorosa la vendetta, ed orribile la strage,’\r\n     says Clavigero; yet he severely condemns Las Casas for his\r\n     distorted account. _Storia Mess._, iii. 63-4. According\r\n     to Sahagun’s native record, the Tlascaltecs persuaded\r\n     Cortés to avenge them on the Cholultecs, and as the latter\r\n     received him coldly, he began to believe the accusations of\r\n     his allies. Assembling the chiefs and soldiers, together\r\n     with citizens, in the temple court, he slaughtered them,\r\n     defenceless as they were. _Hist. Conq._, 18. Bustamante\r\n     comments on this version, and denounces the conquerors as\r\n     atrociously cruel. _Id._ (ed. 1840), 56-63. Duran’s version\r\n     is a little milder. His main object being to give the life\r\n     of Montezuma, he has passed by many events connected with\r\n     the Spaniards, and has suppressed many accounts of their\r\n     cruelties. He accordingly refers but briefly to the Cholula\r\n     massacre, saying that ‘the Indians, in their eagerness to\r\n     serve the Spaniards, came in such large numbers to their\r\n     quarters with provisions, grass, etc., that Cortés suspected\r\n     treasonable designs, and put them to the sword.’ _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, MS., ii. 438-9. Ixtlilxochitl evidently struggles\r\n     between his fear of the Spanish rulers and the desire\r\n     to tell what he regards as the truth. He intimates that\r\n     the only ground for suspicion against the Cholultecs was\r\n     the effort to dissuade Cortés from going to Mexico. The\r\n     chiefs and the citizens were assembled on the pretence of\r\n     selecting carriers, and over 5000 fell beneath the sword.\r\n     _Hist. Chich._, 294. An antagonistic view of the affair\r\n     is offered by Juan Cano, of Narvaez’ expedition, who gave\r\n     Oviedo the hearsay statement that Cortés had asked for 3000\r\n     carriers, and wantonly killed them. iii. 552. Carbajal\r\n     Espinosa, a Mexican historian, like Bustamante, regards\r\n     the victims as innocent and the deed as barbarous. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, ii. 182. Robertson considers that Cortés had good\r\n     reasons for it, yet ‘the punishment was certainly excessive\r\n     and atrocious.’ _Hist. Am._, ii. 452. Solis condemns those\r\n     who seek to accuse the Spaniards of cruelty and to pity the\r\n     Indians—‘maligna compasion, hija del odio y de la envidia.’\r\n     The conquerors gave religion to them, and that he regards\r\n     as sufficient compensation. _Hist. Mex._, i. 345. ‘Cortez\r\n     felt but doubtful of their fidelity, and feared to leave\r\n     his rear to a people who might ruin his enterprise,’ says\r\n     Wilson, _Conq. Mex._, 383, in explanation of the motive;\r\n     but he forgets that a few hostages, as taken from other\r\n     peoples on the route, would have secured Cortés far more\r\n     than the murder of a small percentage of this population.\r\n     Prescott compares the deed with European cruelties, and,\r\n     considering the danger threatening the Spaniards, he excuses\r\n     it. He prefaces his comments by a consideration of the\r\n     right of conquest. _Mex._, ii. 29-39. Alas for honesty,\r\n     humanity, decency, when talented American authors talk of\r\n     the right of one people to rob and murder another people!\r\n     See also _Veytia_, _Hist. Ant. Méj._, iii. 381-2; _Pizarro y\r\n     Orellana_, _Varones Ilvstres_, 86-9; _Peralta_, _Not. Hist._,\r\n     112-13, 313-14; _Pimentel_, _Mem. Sit._, 90-2. Although some\r\n     of the early Dutch writers eagerly copy and even exaggerate\r\n     Las Casas’ version, the contemporary German writers are\r\n     quite moderate. Cortés’ version is given in the _Weltbuch\r\n     Spiegel und bildtnis des gantzen Erdtbodens von Sebastiano\r\n     Franco Wördensi_, Tübingen, 1534, ccxxxvii leaves, beside\r\n     preface and register. This book was much sought after in\r\n     its day, and received several editions, in German and Dutch,\r\n     as late as the seventeenth century. The earliest mentioned\r\n     by Harrisse is dated 1533. The new continent was gradually\r\n     receiving a larger space in the cosmographies at this period,\r\n     and Franck actually assigns it a whole section, as one of\r\n     the four parts of the world. The historic and geographic\r\n     description of Africa occupies the first and smallest\r\n     section; Europe follows and absorbs about half the pages,\r\n     while Asia receives 100 folios, and America the remainder,\r\n     beginning at folio 210. The heading reads: _Von America\r\n     dem vierdten teyl der welt, Anno M.CCCC.XCVII. erfunden_;\r\n     but after this chapter follow several pages on Portuguese\r\n     discoveries in Africa and eastward, till folio 220, when\r\n     begins the voyage of Columbus, ‘sunst Dauber genant,’ the\r\n     German translation of the admiral’s name. After several\r\n     chapters on the physical features, natural resources, and\r\n     inhabitants of the new discoveries, comes one relating how\r\n     Americus Vespucius found the fourth part of the world. This\r\n     is followed by three pages of matter on Asia, as if the\r\n     author, fearful of forgetting it, there and then gave his\r\n     story. Several interpolations occur, but the chief portion\r\n     of the remaining folios relates to Cortés’ conquest of\r\n     Mexico. The carelessly compiled and badly arranged material\r\n     of the volume claims to be based on over sixty authorities,\r\n     among which figure Apianus, Munster, Vespucci, Columbus,\r\n     and Cortés. The affix Wördensi indicates that Franck was a\r\n     Hollander, although he is often referred to as a German,\r\n     probably because his life was passed chiefly in Germany.\r\n     Here he issued, among other works, a not very orthodox\r\n     chronicle, which was excommunicated at Strasburg. Franck\r\n     was chased from more than one place, but enjoys the honor of\r\n     standing in the first class among authors condemned by the\r\n     Roman Church, and of having been deemed worthy of special\r\n     refutation by Luther and Melancthon. Even the liberal-minded\r\n     Bayle, after applying the term Anabaptist, refers to him\r\n     as ‘un vrai fanatique.’ _Dict. Hist._, ii. 1216.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nFROM CHOLULA TO IZTAPALAPAN.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER-NOVEMBER, 1519.\r\n\r\n     MONTEZUMA CONSULTS THE GODS—HE AGAIN BEGS THE STRANGERS NOT\r\n     TO COME TO HIM—POPOCATEPETL AND IZTACCIHUATL—NEWS FROM VILLA\r\n     RICA—DEATH OF ESCALANTE—RETURN OF THE CEMPOALAN ALLIES—AGAIN\r\n     EN ROUTE FOR MEXICO—RECEPTION AT HUEXOTZINCO—FIRST VIEW\r\n     OF THE MEXICAN VALLEY—EXULTATIONS AND MISGIVINGS—RESTING\r\n     AT QUAUHTECHCATL—THE COUNTERFEIT MONTEZUMA—MUNIFICENT\r\n     PRESENTS—THE EMPEROR ATTEMPTS TO ANNIHILATE THE ARMY BY\r\n     MEANS OF SORCERERS—THROUGH QUAUHTECHCATL, AMAQUEMECAN,\r\n     AND TLALMANALCO—A BRILLIANT PROCESSION HERALDS THE\r\n     COMING OF CACAMA, KING OF TEZCUCO—AT CUITLAHUAC—MET BY\r\n     IXTLILXOCHITL—THE HOSPITALITY OF IZTAPALAPAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nElated by his success, Cortés again spoke to the Aztec embassadors,\r\ntelling them in an aggrieved tone that proofs existed connecting\r\nMexican troops with the recent plot, and that it would be only just\r\nfor him to enter and desolate the country for such perfidy. The envoys\r\nprotested their ignorance of any such complicity, and offered to send\r\none of their number to Mexico to ascertain what ground there was for\r\nthe charge. This Cortés agreed to, expressing at the same time the\r\nopinion that Montezuma, after all his friendly demeanor, could hardly\r\nhave favored the treachery. He regarded him as a friend, both for the\r\nsake of his king and for himself, and it was out of deference to him\r\nthat he had spared the Cholultecs from total extermination.[400]\r\n\r\nWhen the envoy reached Mexico he found that his master had retired\r\nto grieve over the fate of the holy city, or more probably over the\r\ndefeat of his plans, and to appeal to the incensed gods by prayers and\r\nfastings, while the priests supported the invocations with reeking\r\nhuman hearts.[401] But the holocaust was in vain, for a miraculous\r\nincident frightened the idols into silence. Among the victims, says\r\na sacred chronicle, was a Tlascaltec, who, while stretched on the\r\nsacrificial stone, called loudly on the God of the advancing Spaniards\r\nto deliver him. The words were yet on his lips when a dazzling light\r\nenveloped the place, revealing a bright-clad being with diadem and\r\nlarge wings. The priests fell awe-stricken to the ground, while the\r\nangel advanced to cheer their victim with hopeful words of a happy\r\nfuture. He was told to announce to the priests that soon the shedding\r\nof human blood would cease, for those destined to rule the land were\r\nat hand. This the victim did, when the sacrifices were resumed, and\r\nwith the name of God the last upon his lips his spirit rose to a\r\nbrighter world.[402]\r\n\r\nThe downfall of Cholula resounded throughout the land, and the\r\nSpaniards were now almost universally confirmed as divine beings,\r\nfrom whom nothing could be kept secret, and whose anger was fierce\r\nand devastating. One effect was the arrival of envoys from quite a\r\nnumber of surrounding chieftains, bearing presents, partly with a view\r\nof gaining the good-will of the dreaded strangers, partly to offer\r\ncongratulations.[403] As for Montezuma, his awe deepened into terror\r\nas the reports came in and the half threatening message of the invader\r\nwas delivered him. It would be dangerous indeed to admit these beings;\r\nbut how prevent it? Thus revolving the matter, Montezuma had recourse\r\nonce more to timid entreaties. His envoy returned to Cholula within a\r\nweek, accompanied by the former chief of the commission, and brought\r\nten plates of gold,[404] fifteen hundred robes, and a quantity of fowl\r\nand delicacies, together with the assurance that he not only had had no\r\nshare in the plot, but desired to see the Cholultecs further chastised\r\nfor their treachery. The Mexican troops near Cholula belonged to the\r\ngarrisons of Acatzingo and Itzucan provinces, and had marched to the\r\naid of that city without his knowledge, prompted wholly by neighborly\r\nfriendship. He begged the Spanish leader not to proceed to Mexico,\r\nwhere want would stare him in the face, but to present his demands\r\nby messengers, so that they might be complied with. Cortés replied\r\nthat he must obey the orders of his king, which were to deliver to\r\nthe emperor in person[405] the friendly communications with which he\r\nhad been intrusted. With this object he had crossed vast oceans and\r\nfought his way through hosts of enemies. The privations and dangers\r\ndepicted could not deter him, for naught availed against his forces,\r\nin field or in town, by day or by night.\r\n\r\nFinding objections futile, Montezuma again consulted the idols. Their\r\nruffled spirit had evidently been soothed by this time, for now came\r\nthe oracle to invite the strangers to Mexico. Once there, it was added,\r\nretreat should be cut off, and their lives offered on the altar.[406]\r\nThis utterance was favored by the counsellors on the ground that if\r\nthe Spaniards were opposed they and their allies might ravage the\r\ncountry. The emperor accordingly sent an invitation, promising that,\r\nalthough the situation of the capital made it difficult to provide\r\nfood, he would do his best to entertain them and give proofs of\r\nhis friendship. The towns en route had orders to supply all their\r\nwants.[407]\r\n\r\nThe story is not without a parallel in classic literature. As Montezuma\r\nawaited the approach of Cortés, so old King Latinus awaited the\r\narrival of Æneas and his Trojan warriors; refusing to give battle, or\r\nto fight the destinies, and curbing his impetuous people by quoting\r\nthe oracle.\r\n\r\nAlong the western horizon of Cholula, at a distance of eight leagues,\r\nruns the mountain range which separates the plain of Huitzilapan\r\nfrom the valley of Mexico. And like sentinels upon it stand, in close\r\nproximity, the two volcanic peaks of Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl,\r\nterms signifying respectively ‘the smoking mountain’ and ‘the white\r\nwoman,’ and indeed most apt, the former being suggested by the\r\nfrequent eruptions, the latter by the snowy covering which falls\r\nlike a tilmatli mantle from a woman’s shoulders. Tradition has it\r\nthat Iztaccihuatl was the wife of her neighbor, whose noise and\r\nfumes were caused by the agonies of tyrants who there underwent\r\npurification ere they could enter final rest.[408] While the Spaniards\r\nwere at Cholula, Popocatepetl was in eruption, an evil omen with\r\nthe Indians, foreshadowing the disturbances soon to overwhelm the\r\ncountry. Interested by a sight so curious and novel, and desirous\r\nof ascertaining for himself and the king the “secret of this smoke,”\r\nCortés consented to let Ordaz ascend the volcano. The Indians sought\r\nto dissuade him from an undertaking which had never been attempted,\r\nand which would in their opinion surely involve the life of him who\r\nventured on it. This made Ordaz only more eager to exhibit his daring,\r\nand joined by nine men he set out under the guidance of some citizens\r\nand carriers who had been persuaded to go part of the way. They had\r\nnot climbed far into the cooler region before the quaking ground and\r\nash-rain caused the party to halt. Ordaz and two of his men continued,\r\nhowever, beyond the limits of vegetation, and over the stones and\r\nbowlders which covered the sandy expanse fringing the region of\r\nperpetual snow. At one time the outburst of ashes and heated stones\r\nobliged them to seek shelter for an hour, after which they sturdily\r\nclimbed onward, turning from their path for a while by the projecting\r\nrock now known as Pico del Fraile, and almost losing themselves in the\r\nash-covered snow. One more effort they made, despite the difficulties\r\nencountered in the rarefied atmosphere of this altitude, and finally\r\nthey reached the summit, more than seventeen thousand seven hundred\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. A short distance to the north rose\r\nthe consort peak, three thousand feet less in height, and at their\r\nfeet extended the field of their future campaign, in the valley to\r\nthe east. The crater was nearly half a league in width, though not\r\ndeep, and presented the appearance of a caldron of boiling glass, as\r\nsays Gomara. The situation was too oppressive to permit of further\r\nobservations, and after securing some snow and icicles as trophies,\r\nthe men hastened to retrace their steps by the already trodden path. On\r\ntheir return they were received with great demonstration, the natives\r\nin particular extolling their deed as something superhuman.[409]\r\n\r\nWhile preparing to leave Cholula, Cortés was startled by news from\r\nVilla Rica of a conflict with Mexicans, resulting in the death of\r\nEscalante and several soldiers. On the northern border of the Totonac\r\nterritory, bathed by the Gulf of Mexico, lay the town and district of\r\nNautla, which together with its river had received from Grijalva the\r\nname of Almería.[410] This was occupied by an Aztec garrison under\r\nQuauhpopoca,[411] whose Aztec pride and loyalty to Montezuma could\r\nill brook the independence achieved by the Totonacs, and who probably\r\ngrieved over the loss of slaves and other contributions which once\r\nswelled his income. No sooner had Cortés disappeared beyond the plateau\r\nborder than my lord grew audacious, encouraged no doubt by the express\r\nor tacit consent of his sovereign, and demanded from the neighboring\r\nTotonacs the customary tribute, under penalty of having their lands\r\nravaged. They refused, pointing out that they were now the subjects\r\nof the great white king. Escalante being appealed to for protection,\r\nsent a message explaining that the independence of the people had\r\n_de facto_ been recognized by Montezuma, with whom he was on friendly\r\nterms. He would allow no interference with them. Quauhpopoca replied\r\nthat his answer would be given on the battle-field. Escalante, nothing\r\nloath, set out at once with fifty men, two horses, and two cannon,\r\nattended by several thousand Totonacs,[412] and reached the vicinity\r\nof Nautla, where Quauhpopoca was already committing depredations.\r\nThe armies met, and a fierce battle ensued. Awed by the remembrance\r\nof former defeats at the hands of the Aztecs, the Totonacs comported\r\nthemselves so poorly[413] that the brunt of the fight had to be borne\r\nby the Spaniards, of whom several were killed and wounded, while one\r\nwas captured, and a horse destroyed. The enemy was put to flight, but\r\nit has been said as an excuse for their defeat the Mexican officers\r\ndeclared to Montezuma that the virgin bearing an infant led the\r\nSpaniards in their attack which spread terror and fearful slaughter\r\nin their ranks.[414] Escalante laid waste the district, and captured\r\nNautla town, which was sacked and burned. This lesson finished, he\r\nhastened back to Villa Rica, and there within three days succumbed to\r\nhis wounds together with several soldiers, so that the campaign cost\r\nthe lives of seven or nine men.[415] From prisoners it was understood\r\nthat Quauhpopoca had acted wholly under orders from Montezuma. The\r\ncaptured soldier was Argüello, of Leon, a young man of powerful frame,\r\nwith a large head and a curly black beard. He appears to have died\r\nfrom his wounds on the way to Mexico, and the head was presented to\r\nthe emperor. Its wild appearance, however, increased by the black,\r\ncurly beard, made so bad an impression upon him that he refused to\r\noffer it to his idols, ordering it to be sent to some other town.[416]\r\n\r\nFearing that these tidings might dishearten the men, Cortés said\r\nnothing about the affair;[417] but it had nevertheless a bad effect,\r\nfor the Cempoalan allies, who had learned a few particulars from the\r\nmessengers, requested at the last moment to be dismissed to their\r\nhomes, pleading not only the long absence from their families, but\r\nthe fear of being treated at Mexico as rebels. Cortés sought to\r\nreassure them, declaring that no harm could reach any one under his\r\nprotection. Furthermore he would enrich them. But the larger portion\r\nstill insisted, and since they had served him well, he did not wish\r\nto compel them. Several packs of the rich robes obtained from Mexico\r\nwere accordingly divided among the leaders, two packages being destined\r\nfor Chicomacatl and his nephew Cuexco, and with this parting gift\r\nall but a small body returned to Cempoala.[418]\r\n\r\nAfter a stay at Cholula of nearly three weeks[419] the Spaniards\r\nset out for Mexico, attended by about six thousand natives, chiefly\r\nTlascaltecs, with a sprinkling of Cempoalans, Cholultecs, and\r\nHuexotzincas.[420] They passed through Huexotzinco by a route already\r\nfollowed by Ordaz, and recommended as the best and safest. The first\r\ncamp was made at the Huexotzinca village of Izcalpan, over four\r\nleagues from Cholula, where they met with a most friendly reception,\r\nand received abundant provisions, together with some female slaves and\r\na little gold. Leaving behind them the smiling plain of Huitzilapan,\r\nwhere they had overcome so many dangers and obtained so many proofs\r\nof good-will, on the following day they approached the mountains and\r\ncame upon the regular highway which leads across the range to the\r\nvalley of Mexico. The junction of the roads was at the south-west\r\nborder of Huexotzinco, where the Mexicans had left a proof of their\r\nhostility toward this republic, allied to Tlascala, by blocking up the\r\nway with trees and other material.[421] These were removed, and the\r\narmy began the steep ascent of the pass, pressing onward against the\r\nchilling winds which swept down from its frozen heights, and before\r\nlong they were tramping through the snow which covered the summit.\r\n\r\nHere they were cheered by a sight which made them, for the moment\r\nat least, forget their hardships. A turn in the road disclosed the\r\nvalley of Mexico—the object of their toil and suffering—stretching\r\nfrom the slope of the forest-clad ranges at their feet as far as\r\nthe eye could reach, and presenting one picturesque intermingling of\r\ngreen prairies, golden fields, and blooming gardens, clustering round\r\na series of lakes. Towns lay thickly sprinkled, revealed by towering\r\nedifices and gleaming walls, and conspicuous above all, the queen city\r\nherself, placidly reposing upon the mirrored surface of the larger\r\nwater. Above her rose the cypress-crowned hill of Chapultepec, with\r\nits stately palace consecrated to the glories of Aztec domination.[422]\r\n\r\nThe first transport over, there came a revulsion of feeling. The\r\nevidently dense population of the valley and the many fortified towns\r\nconfirmed the mysterious warnings of the allies against a powerful\r\nand warlike people, and again the longing for the snug and secure\r\nplantations of Cuba found expression among the faint-hearted, as they\r\nshivered in the icy blast and wrapped themselves the closer in the\r\nabsence of food and shelter. In this frame of mind the glistening\r\nfarm-houses seemed only so many troops of savage warriors, lurking\r\namidst the copses and arbors for victims to grace the stone of\r\nsacrifice and the festive board; and the stately towns appeared\r\nimpregnable fortresses, which promised only to become their prisons\r\nand graves. So loud grew the murmur as to indicate mutiny; but Cortés,\r\nwith his usual firm words, quieted the soldiers, supported as he was\r\nby the spirited majority.[423]\r\n\r\nAfter descending for a short distance they came to the travellers’\r\nstation of Quauhtechcatl,[424] whose commodious edifices afforded\r\nroom for the whole army. The Mexicans had prepared for the arrival by\r\nfurnishing an abundance of provisions, with fires in all the rooms,\r\nand the tired soldiers eagerly gave themselves up to repose.[425]\r\nNo less exhausted than they, Cortés nevertheless could not think of\r\nrest till he had seen to the security of the camp. His prudence on\r\nthis occasion came near costing him dearly, for in the darkness a\r\nsentinel taking him for a spy drew his cross-bow. Fortunately he heard\r\nthe click and announced himself.[426] This promptness on the part\r\nof the guard was by no means unnecessary; during the night a dozen\r\nor more prowling natives met the fate which the general so narrowly\r\nescaped. They were supposed to have been the spies of an army hidden\r\nin the forest, which, on observing the watchfulness of the Spaniards,\r\nabandoned the premeditated attack.[427]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMontezuma’s fears appeared to grow with the approach of Cortés, and\r\nso did his anxiety about the import of the message which must be\r\ndelivered to him alone. Could there be a design upon his person?\r\nThis must be ascertained before the invaders came too near. Among\r\nhis courtiers was a noble named Tzihuacpopoca, who greatly resembled\r\nhim in person and voice. Him he commanded to proceed to the Spanish\r\ncamp, attended by a large retinue, and by representing himself as\r\nthe emperor to ascertain from the white chief what his intentions\r\nwere, and to induce him with liberal offers to turn back. The idea\r\nwas based on an incident which had occurred not many years before,\r\nwherein one of the tripartite monarchs saved his life by appearing\r\nin proxy at a treacherous court. Montezuma hoped to derive from a\r\nsimilar trick more than one advantage.\r\n\r\nTzihuacpopoca arrived at the mountain camp the morning after the\r\nSpaniards had entered it, and created no little excitement by the\r\nannouncement that the emperor was present in person. Preparations\r\nwere made to give him a brilliant reception. Unfortunately for the\r\nenvoy, his secret had too many keepers in the large suite attending\r\nhim; there were also many among the allies who had been at Montezuma’s\r\ncourt, and who looked on this sudden arrival as suspicious. They made\r\ninquiries and soon ascertained the truth. Cortés received the great\r\nman with courtesy, heralded as he was with a present of three thousand\r\npesos de oro, but he resolved to take advantage of the discovery to\r\nimpress him with his penetration. After a few moments’ conversation\r\nhe told the noble with a severe tone that he was not the monarch\r\nhe represented himself to be.[428] He also referred to the attempts\r\nmade during the night to surprise the camp, as indicated by the dead\r\nspies, and assured him that his men were always prepared against plots\r\nand deception, and any attempts against them would lead only to the\r\ndiscomfiture and grief of the enemy. Awed by the superior intelligence\r\nand power of the general, the envoy thought no longer of anything\r\nelse than to keep such a man from entering Mexico. He presented among\r\nother reasons that the city could be reached only in canoes, and\r\nthat provisions were difficult to obtain there. He repeated the offer\r\nalready made of an annual tribute payable in treasures on the coast,\r\nand promised as a bribe for Cortés himself four loads of gold, and\r\nfor each of his officers and men one load.[429] Dazzling as the offer\r\nwas, Cortés regarded it as but a faint reflection of still richer\r\ntreasures, the attainment of which must procure for him greater glory\r\nthan he had as yet dreamed of. In his reply he accordingly pointed\r\nout how strange it must appear to turn back now that he was within\r\nview of the goal. Such conduct would disgrace any envoy. No! he dared\r\nnot disobey the orders of his king, who had sent him upon a mission\r\nof great benefit to Montezuma. He would leave as soon as this was\r\naccomplished, if desired.[430]\r\n\r\nNothing abashed by this rebuff, Montezuma again had recourse to the\r\nblack art, and sent a number of sorcerers, the native records say, to\r\ncast spells on the Spaniards. They soon returned with the report that\r\non nearing Tlalmanalco, Tezcatlipoca had appeared to them in the guise\r\nof a drunken peasant, frightening them greatly, and saying: “Fools,\r\nreturn! Your mission is in vain! Montezuma will lose his empire in\r\npunishment for tyranny, and I, I leave Mexico to her fate and cast you\r\noff!” The sorcerers recognized the god, and prostrated themselves to\r\nadore him, but he spurned their devotion, rebuking them, and finally\r\npointed to Mexico, saying: “Behold her doom!” Looking round they saw\r\nher enveloped in flames, and the inhabitants in conflict with white\r\nmen. On turning again to beseech the god he was gone.[431]\r\n\r\nMontezuma was in consultation with his advisers when this report was\r\nbrought. As if pierced by death’s dart, the monarch bowed low his\r\nhead and moaned: “We are lost! We are lost!”[432] Less impressed with\r\nsuperstitious fear by an incident which he regarded as concocted by\r\nthe sorcerers, Cuitlahuatzin vividly presented the danger of admitting\r\nsuch determined and powerful intruders within the city, and he boldly\r\nurged that they be forbidden to enter, by force of arms if need be.\r\nCacama remonstrated that after inviting them such a course would\r\nsavor of fear. The emperor owed it to his exalted station and power to\r\nreceive envoys. If they proved objectionable, the city should become\r\ntheir tomb. Surely his nobles and his armies were able to overcome\r\nso small a number, assisted by the strategic advantages of the place\r\nin its approaches and resources. To the affrighted monarch anything\r\nwas acceptable that would stay prompt action, and consequently defer\r\nthe ruin which he feared. He at once inclined to Cacama’s advice,\r\nstipulating, however, that he, king as he was, should condescend\r\nto meet the Spaniards and sound their intentions. “May the gods not\r\nplace within your house, my lord, one who shall cast you forth and\r\nusurp the empire,” was the solemn warning of Cuitlahuatzin, as he\r\nheard this resolution.[433]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards had meanwhile descended the wooded slope from\r\nQuauhtechcatl to the cultivated district round Amaquemecan, a city\r\nwhich, together with its suburban villages for two leagues around,\r\nnumbered over twenty thousand families.[434] The lord, Cacamatzin\r\nTeotlateuchtli, received them in his own palace, and entertained\r\nthem most liberally during their two days’ stay, presenting them\r\ngifts of forty female slaves and three thousand castellanos in\r\ngold. The chiefs of Tlalmanalco and other neighboring towns came\r\nto tender their respects, and encouraged by the reports of Spanish\r\nprowess they hesitated not to lay bare their grievances against the\r\nAztecs, who oppressed them with heavy taxes, robbed them of wives and\r\ndaughters, and carried the men into slavery. Cortés encouraged the\r\nchiefs with fair promises, and was not a little delighted at finding\r\ndisaffection in the very heart of the empire, whose power had been\r\nso much extolled.[435]\r\n\r\nPassing by way of Tlalmanalco through a succession of flourishing\r\nmaize and maguey fields, the Spaniards reached Ayotzinco, a town at\r\nthe south end of Chalco lake.[436] Here was seen the first specimen\r\nof the peculiar aquatic cities of the lake region. Half of the town\r\nstood on piles, and was intersected by canals, wherein the traffic,\r\nwith canoes, was far livelier than in the streets. The other half\r\nlay at the foot of steep hills, upon one of which the Spaniards were\r\nencamped. Prompted either by curiosity or by evil purposes, a number\r\nof Indians attempted during the night to enter the Spanish quarter,\r\nonly to pay with their lives for the indiscretion.[437]\r\n\r\nIn the morning messengers arrived requesting the Spaniards to await the\r\ncoming of Cacama. Shortly after appeared a procession more brilliant\r\nthan any yet seen. In a litter profusely ornamented with gold, silver,\r\nand feather ornaments, and even inlaid with precious stones, sat the\r\nking of Tezcuco, a young man of about twenty-five, carried by eight\r\npowerful caciques. As he stepped out, attendants proceeded to sweep\r\nthe road, removing even the straws, while nobles held over his head\r\na canopy of green feathers, studded with gems, to shield him from the\r\nsun. With stately steps the monarch advanced toward Cortés, saluting\r\nhim in the customary manner.[438] He had come, he said, with these\r\nnobles, in the name of Montezuma, their master, to serve him, and\r\nto provide all that was needed. He thereupon presented a rich gift,\r\nto which Cortés responded with three fine marcasite stones[439] for\r\nhimself, and with blue glass diamonds for the nobles. In order to\r\nsound him, Cacama represented that there existed almost insurmountable\r\nobstacles to his entry into Mexico, among them the fears of the\r\npopulace, which had been aroused by terrible accounts of the cruelty\r\nof his followers.[440] Cortés sought to reassure him, and declared\r\nthat no obstacles were insurmountable to his men, whereupon Cacama\r\nhastened to state that Montezuma himself would willingly receive them,\r\nand did tender an invitation. He now returned to Mexico to prepare\r\nfor the inevitable visit, leaving among the Spaniards the impression\r\nthat if he, the inferior king, exhibited such grandeur, that of the\r\nemperor must indeed be imperial.[441]\r\n\r\nProceeding along the lake they entered upon a causeway in width a\r\nspear’s length, leading through the waters for over a half league to\r\n“the prettiest little town which we had yet seen, both with regard\r\nto its well built houses and towers, and to its situation,” as\r\nCortés remarks. The admiring soldiers called it Venezuela, or little\r\nVenice, the native name being Cuitlahuac. It was situated on an\r\nislet, connected also with the northern shore by an extension of the\r\ncauseway, and contained a population of about two thousand families,\r\nsupported chiefly by floriculture, which was carried on to a great\r\nextent by means of _chinampas_, or floating gardens.[442] The chiefs\r\ncame forth, headed by Atlpopocatzin,[443] and showed themselves most\r\nattentive. Here again complaints were uttered about Aztec oppression,\r\nwith the warning that the Spaniards would meet with no true friendship\r\nat Mexico.[444]\r\n\r\nThe Mexican envoys suspected the disaffection of Cuitlahuac, and\r\nprevailed on the Spaniards to pass onward to Iztapalapan, where\r\npreparations had been made to receive them. As they neared the densely\r\npopulated lake district, the crowds became larger and more curious,\r\nwondering at the fair hue and bushy beards of the strangers, and\r\nadmiring the comely horses, and the glittering arms and helmets.\r\n“Surely they must be divine beings,” some said, “coming as they do\r\nfrom where the sun rises.” “Or demons,” hinted others. But the old\r\nmen, wise in the records of their race, sighed as they remembered\r\nthe prophecies, and muttered that these must be the predicted ones\r\nwho were to rule the land and be their masters.[445] To prevent the\r\nnatives from mingling with his men, and creating not only disorder\r\nbut diminishing the awe with which they were regarded, the horsemen in\r\nthe van received orders to keep the Indians at a respectful distance.\r\nIztapalapan was already in sight when a large force of armed warriors\r\nwas seen advancing, so large that it seemed as if the armies of\r\nMexico had come to overwhelm them. They were reassured, however, by\r\nthe announcement that it was Ixtlilxochitl with his escort, intent\r\non having an interview with his proposed ally. The prince had urged\r\nupon Cortés to take a more northern route and join him at Calpulalpan,\r\nbut finding that the general preferred the Amaquemecan road, he had\r\nhastened to meet the Spaniards on the lake. The approach of this\r\npersonage had made the court of Tezcuco more pliable to one whose\r\ndesigns were well understood. When Ixtlilxochitl therefore came\r\nnear the city, the elder brother, Cohuanacotzin, made efforts for\r\na closer conciliation with himself and Cacama.[446] The opportunity\r\nwas favorable, for the indisposition of Cortés to enter actively into\r\nthe plans of the former, and his advance on Mexico, with proclaimed\r\nfriendship for Montezuma, made Ixtlilxochitl not averse to the advances\r\nof his brothers, particularly since he intended this in no wise to\r\ninterfere with his schemes. The result of the negotiation was that\r\nhe found himself admitted with great pomp into his paternal city,\r\nwherein he hoped some day to displace Cacama. Imbued more than ever\r\nwith his ambition, he hastened to intercept the Spanish captain, in\r\norder personally to promote his views and induce him to come northward\r\nto Tezcuco and to his own capital. Cortés was full of promises, but\r\nit did not just then suit him to disarrange the plan he had formed,\r\nand so Ixtlilxochitl had to wait.\r\n\r\nIt is this meeting no doubt which has been wrongly extended by several\r\nauthorities into a visit to Tezcuco.[447]\r\n\r\nAs the Spaniards approached Iztapalapan,[448] Cuitlahuatzin, the\r\nbrother of Montezuma and lord of the city, came forth in company with\r\nTezozomoc, lord of the adjoining Culhuacan, and a number of other\r\ncaciques and nobles,[449] to escort his guests to their quarters\r\nin his palace. The city with its ten thousand to twelve thousand\r\nhouses was constructed partly on piles, and crossed by canals, on\r\neither side of which rose substantial buildings, chiefly of stone, a\r\nlarge proportion being, according to the conqueror, “as fine as the\r\nbest in Spain, both in extent and construction.” The Spaniards were\r\nawed by the beauty of the place. The palace was particularly fine\r\nand spacious, with courts shaded by awnings of brilliant colors and\r\nbordered by commodious apartments. Adjoining it, and overlooked by a\r\nlarge pavilion, was a vast garden, divided into four squares by hedges\r\nof plaited reeds, which were entirely overgrown with roses and other\r\nflowers. Shaded walks led out in all directions, now by beds of rare\r\nplants collected from remote parts, now into orchards temptingly laden,\r\nand again past groups of artistically arranged flowers. In ponds fed\r\nby navigable canals sported innumerable water-fowl, consorting with\r\nfishes of different species. In the centre of the garden was an immense\r\nreservoir of hewn stone, four hundred paces square, surrounded by a\r\ntiled pavement from which steps led at intervals to the water.[450]\r\n\r\nCortés was not only hospitably entertained, but received a present\r\nof female slaves, packs of cloth, and over three thousand castellanos\r\nin gold.[451]\r\n\r\nThe soldiers now prepared under more than usual excitement for\r\nthe final march, which was to bring them to the longed-for goal.\r\nThe reputed magnificence of the capital made most of the Spaniards\r\neager to enter; but there were others who recalled the rumors of its\r\nstrength, and of the terrible plots which their timid allies declared\r\nwere to encompass them. “Being men and fearing death, we could not\r\navoid thinking of this,” says Bernal Diaz, frankly, “and commending\r\nourselves to God.” And as he remembers how warnings failed to deter\r\nthem, the old soldier bursts forth in self-admiration, “What men have\r\nexisted in the world so daring?”[452]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [400] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 75-6; _Gomara_, _Hist.

According to Cortés they failed to reach the summit,\r\n     although coming very near to it. But this statement is open\r\n     to doubt, for Cortés is not liberal in according credit to\r\n     others where it might tend to call attention from himself,\r\n     particularly to a man like Ordaz, who had, until quite\r\n     lately, been his most bitter opponent. Gomara had evidently\r\n     good authority for his statement, since he in this case\r\n     failed to follow his patron’s version; and Bernal Diaz, who\r\n     is always ready to contradict him, and who was no friend\r\n     of Ordaz, does also admit that he reached the summit. He\r\n     gives him only two companions, however, and starts them\r\n     from Tlascala. _Hist. Verdad._, 55. Leading modern authors\r\n     are inclined to doubt their success. Prescott, Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg, and others, from a misinterpretation of Cortés’\r\n     text, allow the ascent to be made while the army was camped\r\n     on the summit of the range, en route for Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Ordaz no doubt claimed to have reached the summit, since\r\n     the emperor granted him a coat of arms, wherein the\r\n     achievement is commemorated by a blazing mountain. Had he not\r\n     merited it, his many jealous companions would surely have\r\n     raised a clamor. He became also a knight of Santiago, in\r\n     acknowledgment of his services during the conquest. Having\r\n     beside acquired great wealth, he might have rested on his\r\n     laurels; but eager to emulate his late chief, he in 1530\r\n     petitioned for and obtained the governorship of the tract\r\n     between Rio Marañon and Cabo de la Vela, in South America,\r\n     with a right to extend the conquest. After suffering great\r\n     hardship there he set out for Spain, two years later, to\r\n     recruit his health and seek redress against rival conquerors.\r\n     He died on the way. _Oviedo_, ii. 211-24; _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     iv. lib. x. cap. ix.; dec. v. lib. i. cap. xi. Simon has\r\n     him arraigned at Española for cruelty to his men, etc.\r\n     Ordaz insists on going to Spain for justice, and fearing\r\n     the result, since he stood in high favor there, his enemies\r\n     poisoned him during the voyage. _Conq. Tierra Firme_, 104-35.\r\n     His portrait is given in _Carbajal Espinosa_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     ii. 192, and _Prescott’s Mex._ (Gondra ed. of Mex.), iii.\r\n     221. ‘Su familia establecida en Puebla, en donde creo que\r\n     todavía quedan descendientes suyos.’ _Alaman_, _Disert._,\r\n     i. 101. Montaño, among other conquerors, made the ascent of\r\n     the volcano not long after this, and he is even said to have\r\n     descended into the crater. Padre Sahagun also reached the\r\n     summit. _Hist. Gen._, iii. 317; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vi.\r\n     cap. xviii.; _Torquemada_, i. 436-7; _Peter Martyr_, dec. v.\r\n     cap. ii. The next successful ascent was not made till 1827,\r\n     by Messrs Glennie. Sonneschmidt had explored Popocatepetl\r\n     partially only in 1772, but had reached the summit of the\r\n     consort peak. Berkbeck explored in the same year as the\r\n     Glennies. Gérolt and Gros attempted the ascent in 1833 and\r\n     1834, and succeeded in reaching the summit on the second\r\n     occasion. The record is given in _Revista Mex._, i. 461-82.\r\n     In 1857 the Mexican government sent up a successful exploring\r\n     expedition under Sonntag and Laverrière, whose report,\r\n     with drawings, is given in _Soc. Mex. Geog._, _Boletin_,\r\n     vi. 218-45. Meanwhile the observations of Gérolt and Gros\r\n     had led to the examination of the crater for sulphur, an\r\n     industry carried on pretty regularly since 1836. The volcano\r\n     was in frequent eruption about the conquest period, as if\r\n     in sympathy with the political turmoils around it. One of\r\n     the heaviest discharges recorded took place in 1539-40,\r\n     which covered the neighboring towns, as far as Tlascala,\r\n     with ashes. Since then it has been comparatively silent,\r\n     the last two outbreaks being in 1663-4 and 1697. ubi sup.,\r\n     204-5; _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 55; _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. vi. cap. xviii. The eruption of 1663-4 created great\r\n     terror in Puebla, as Vetancurt relates. _Teatro Mex._, pt.\r\n     i. 26. Bustamante extends this activity to 1665. _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 75.\r\n\r\n     Rude cuts of the volcanic eruption of 1519 are to be seen in\r\n     the old and curious cosmographies of Sebastian Munster. This\r\n     learned man, famous as a Hebrew scholar, as mathematician and\r\n     cartographer, was the author of some forty printed works,\r\n     and would probably have issued as many more had not the\r\n     plague cut him off at Basle, in 1552, at the age of 63. His\r\n     editions of Ptolemy’s Geography began in 1540, and in the\r\n     following year, according to _Labanoff’s Catalogue_, appeared\r\n     the first edition of his _Cosmographia Beschreibung_; but\r\n     this date, accepted by several bibliographers, as well\r\n     as that of 1543 for a Latin edition, are evidently wrong,\r\n     since Munster in his dedication of 1550, to King Gustavus\r\n     I. of Sweden, remarks that ‘Inn dise dritt edition’ he had\r\n     hoped to include a description of Stockholm and other towns\r\n     under the king, but had not received a reply to his demands\r\n     therefor. A few lines above this he writes equally to the\r\n     point: ‘Als ich aber vor sechs jaren noch mit diser arbeit\r\n     vmbgieng, ist zũ mir kommen E. K. M. diener, der hochgelert\r\n     herr, herr Georgius Normannus, dem ich vorhin auss etlichen\r\n     büchern vnder meinem namen aussgangen, bekãt wz, vnd als\r\n     er besichtiget dise für genom̂en arbeit, schetzet er\r\n     sie wol wirdig, das sie vnd dem künigliche schirm E. M.\r\n     an tag käme.’ Nothing could more conclusively show that\r\n     the work had not appeared in print before 1544. The second\r\n     edition appeared in 1545. The title of the first reads:\r\n     _Cosmographia. Beschreibũg aller Lender Durch Sebastianum\r\n     Munsterum. Getruckt zü Basel durch Henrichum Petri. Anno\r\n     MDxliiij._ The Gothic text is accompanied by marginals in\r\n     Italics, and illustrated with numerous small wood-cuts, some\r\n     being of the character which permits their reproduction\r\n     in different chapters and for different countries. In\r\n     the African division we find beings of the Anubis and\r\n     Polyphemus type, and animal monsters of different form. In\r\n     the dedication to Gustavus, Munster speaks of having spent\r\n     eighteen years in collecting and arranging his material, on\r\n     the plan of ‘dẽ hochgelerten man̂ Strabõi,’which is not\r\n     very flattering to that geographer, if the method before us\r\n     be accepted as a specimen. He divides the volume into six\r\n     books—the first devoted to mathematical geography, the next\r\n     three to a general rambling description of Europe, chiefly\r\n     with reference to the natural resources and settlements of\r\n     the different countries. In the third book, covering two\r\n     thirds of the text, and relating to Germany, each little\r\n     province receives a historic notice, and every town and\r\n     castle of any note its description, with rude wood-cuts\r\n     attached. The next division given at some length is Asia,\r\n     to which is appended half a dozen pages on America, while\r\n     Africa closes with the sixth book and about three times\r\n     that amount of text. The one chapter relating to our\r\n     continent is headed, _Von den neuwen inseln_, and gives a\r\n     vague account of the discovery, the physical features and\r\n     natural products of the land, the inhabitants and their\r\n     customs, illustrated with several cuts, among them a volcano\r\n     in eruption and two cannibal scenes. The regular maps are\r\n     grouped at the beginning of the volume, each on the verso\r\n     and recto of two leaves, bearing on the first recto the\r\n     title, inclosed in a border more or less ornamented with\r\n     portraits, symbols, and arabesque. The mappemonde shows\r\n     _Terra Florida_ and _Francisia_ on each side of a bay.\r\n     Above this runs a wide strait marked _Per hoc fretû iter\r\n     patit ad Molucas_, which issues between _Cathay regio_ and\r\n     _Temistitan_. Below this land are placed Hispaniola and\r\n     Cuba, at the mouth of another wide strait, bounded on the\r\n     south by the large island of _America seu insula Brasilij_.\r\n     Further down is _Fretû Magaliani_, with a large island to the\r\n     south. The map for America bears the inscription: ‘_Die newe\r\n     weldt der grossen und vilen Inselen_.’ The second edition\r\n     of 1545 is considerably enlarged, the chapter on America\r\n     covering nine pages. In the third edition, of 1550, the\r\n     wood-cuts are increased by a number of large plans, views\r\n     of towns, and other scenes by Deutsch, making this the most\r\n     attractive volume for collectors. A portrait of the author\r\n     in his sixtieth year is also given. The various editions in\r\n     different languages, issued even in the following century,\r\n     vary considerably in arrangement and extent, and that of\r\n     1614, although improved and enlarged to 1575 pages, devotes\r\n     only ten to America, while previous editions contain more\r\n     material thereon. The binding is provided with bosses,\r\n     clasps, and vellum cover, impressed with tracery, portraits,\r\n     and emblems.\r\n\r\n     [410] Cap. iii. note 1.\r\n\r\n     [411] ‘Quauhpopocatzin, señor de Coyohuacan, uno de los\r\n     grandes del imperio, que asistia en Nauhtlan, y estaba\r\n     á su cargo el gobierno de las costas del mar del norte.’\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 296.\r\n\r\n     [412] Bernal Diaz writes, 40 soldiers, 2 cannon, 2 firelocks,\r\n     3 cross-bows and 2000 natives; Cortés, 50 Spaniards and 8000\r\n     to 10,000 Indians, ‘y doce tiros de pólvora.’ _Cartas_, 88.\r\n\r\n     [413] ‘Á la primera refriega ... huyeron, y dexaron al Juan\r\n     de Escalante peleando,’ says Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     74.\r\n\r\n     [414] ‘And Montezuma believed this to be the great lady\r\n     whom we claimed for patroness.’ ‘Todos los soldados que\r\n     passamos con Cortés, tenemos muy creido.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 74.\r\n\r\n     [415] ‘Seis soldados juntamente con él.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 73. ‘Nueue Españoles,’ says Gomara, who\r\n     assumes that two were previously assassinated by Quauhpopoca.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 122, 129.\r\n\r\n     [416] According to Bernal Diaz, whose version is chiefly\r\n     adhered to, the death of so many soldiers caused the\r\n     Spaniards to fall somewhat in the estimation of the Indians,\r\n     who had looked upon them as invulnerable beings. ‘Y que\r\n     todos los pueblos de la sierra, y Cempoal, y su sujeto,\r\n     están alterados, y no les quieren dar comida, ni servir.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 73-4. But this is probably\r\n     an exaggeration, for Cortés would not have ventured to\r\n     send down a new comandante almost without escort, or to\r\n     have remained quietly at Mexico for months, had his rear\r\n     been so threatened. Cortés, who should be regarded as the\r\n     best authority, gives a curious motive for the campaign.\r\n     Qualpopoca, as he calls him, sent a message to Escalante,\r\n     offering to become a vassal of the Spanish king. He had not\r\n     submitted before, fearing to pass through the intervening\r\n     hostile country; but if four soldiers were sent to escort\r\n     him, he would come with them. Believing this protestation,\r\n     Escalante sent the four men, two of whom wounded returned\r\n     shortly after with the story that Quauhpopoca had sought to\r\n     kill them, and had succeeded in despatching their comrades.\r\n     This led to the expedition of Escalante. _Cartas_, 87-8.\r\n     It appears most unlikely that this officer should have so\r\n     far forgotten the prudence ever enjoined on his captains by\r\n     Cortés, and trusted only four men in an unknown country,\r\n     in response to so suspicious a request. There was beside\r\n     no need for Quauhpopoca to go to Villa Rica, since his\r\n     submission through envoys would be just as binding. If he\r\n     desired to see the Spanish fort, he could have gone safely\r\n     by water, for large canoes were used on the coast. It is\r\n     not improbable that the story was made up to justify the\r\n     expedition sent against Nautla, since a campaign by a small\r\n     force, merely on behalf of a wretched tribe of natives,\r\n     might have been regarded as unwarranted. This story was also\r\n     useful afterward, when Cortés first thought proper to reveal\r\n     it, for rousing his men to action. Gomara follows Cortés,\r\n     with the difference that Pedro de Ircio, as he wrongly\r\n     calls the captain at Villa Rica, having orders from Cortés\r\n     to anticipate Garay by incorporating Almería, sent an order\r\n     to Quauhpopoca to tender his submission. This he agreed to\r\n     do, provided the four Spaniards were sent to escort him.\r\n     Gomara appears to favor the view that Quauhpopoca acted on\r\n     his own responsibility, for he says that this chief sent to\r\n     warn Montezuma of Cortés’ intention to usurp the empire, and\r\n     to urge upon him to seize the white captain. _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     122, 129. Bernal Diaz stamps this account as false. Peter\r\n     Martyr, dec. v. cap. iii., assumes that the two Spaniards\r\n     were slain by robbers, so that Quauhpopoca was innocent of\r\n     any misdeed. Tapia’s version is incomplete, but appears to\r\n     favor Bernal Diaz. In Duran’s native record, Coatlpopoca\r\n     appears as the guide of the Spaniards. He treacherously\r\n     leads them along a precipice, over which two horsemen fall\r\n     with their steeds, and are killed. For this he is tried\r\n     and executed. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 411-13.\r\n\r\n     [417] He reveals it only after his arrival at Mexico, and\r\n     thus leads Bernal Diaz to assume that the news reached him\r\n     there. In this he is followed by Herrera, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     viii. cap. i., and consequently by Torquemada, i. 455.\r\n\r\n     [418] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 62; _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 97; _Torquemada_, i. 442.\r\n\r\n     [419] The estimate varies from fourteen days, _Herrera_,\r\n     to over twenty days, _Gomara_. By assuming that nineteen\r\n     days were spent at Cholula, the army has a week in which\r\n     to reach Mexico, and this is about the time consumed.\r\n\r\n     [420] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 97. ‘Saliẽdo acompañarle los\r\n     señores de Chulula, y con gran marauilla de los Embaxadores\r\n     Mexicanos.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vii. cap. iii.\r\n     ‘Andauamos la barba sobre el ombro,’ says Bernal Diaz, in\r\n     allusion to the precautions observed. _Hist. Verdad._, 63.\r\n\r\n     [421] Bernal Diaz relates in a confused manner that at\r\n     Izcalpan the Spaniards were told of two wide roads beginning\r\n     beyond the first pass. One, easy and open, led to Chalco;\r\n     the other, to Tlalmanalco, had been obstructed with trees\r\n     to impede the horses, and so induce the army to take the\r\n     Chalco route, upon which the Aztecs lay in ambush, ready to\r\n     fall upon them. _Hist. Verdad._, 63. This finds some support\r\n     in Sahagun, whose mythic account relates that Montezuma,\r\n     in his fear of the advancing forces, had blocked the direct\r\n     road to Mexico and planted maguey upon it, so as to direct\r\n     them to Tezcuco. _Hist. Conq._, 21. Cortés indicates clearly\r\n     enough that the Mexican envoys had at Cholula recommended\r\n     a route leading from that city south of Huexotzinco to the\r\n     usual mountain pass, and used by their people in order to\r\n     avoid this inimical territory. Upon it every accommodation\r\n     had been prepared for the Spaniards. This road was not\r\n     only circuitous, but had been declared by Tlascaltecs and\r\n     others as hard and perilous, with deep ravines, spanned by\r\n     narrow and insecure bridges, and with Aztec armies lying\r\n     in ambush. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 76-8; _Tapia_, _Rel._, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 574. Peter Martyr, dec. v.\r\n     cap. ii., calls this route shorter and easier, though more\r\n     dangerous. Certain remarks by Bernal Diaz indicate that\r\n     the ambush had been arranged in connection with the plot\r\n     at Cholula, and abandoned upon its failure, loc. cit. There\r\n     could hardly have been more than one route across the range,\r\n     through the pass wherein the Aztecs had erected their station\r\n     for travellers, and this the Spaniards did follow. Here also\r\n     accommodation was prepared for them, and here the embassy\r\n     from Montezuma appeared. Hence the obstructions spoken of\r\n     must have been at the junction of the Huexotzinca road with\r\n     the main road from Cholula to the pass, and intended as\r\n     an intimation to the Huexotzincas or to the Mexicans not\r\n     to trespass. They could have been of no avail against the\r\n     Spaniards, who were beside invited to enter on the main\r\n     road then at hand. These are facts overlooked by Prescott,\r\n     Clavigero, and writers generally who have lost themselves\r\n     in the vague and confused utterances of the chroniclers,\r\n     and in seeking to elaborate a most simple affair. Modern\r\n     travellers follow the easier and less picturesque route\r\n     north of Iztaccihuatl, which skirts Mount Telapon. This\r\n     was the road recommended by Ixtlilxochitl, leading through\r\n     Calpulalpan, where he promised to join him with his army;\r\n     but Cortés preferred to trust to his own arms and to his\r\n     Tlascaltec followers. _Torquemada_, i. 442.\r\n\r\n     [422] ‘Dezian algunos Castellanos, que aquella era la tierra\r\n     para su buena dicha prometida, y que mientras mas Moros,\r\n     mas ganancia.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vii. cap. iii.\r\n\r\n     [423] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 97; _Oviedo_, iii. 500.\r\n\r\n     [424] _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 295. Torquemada,\r\n     followed by Brasseur de Bourbourg and others, calls it\r\n     Ithualco, which appears rather to have been a general term\r\n     for these stations, since ithualli, according to Molina,\r\n     signifies a court. Peter Martyr and Gomara refer to it as\r\n     a summer palace.\r\n\r\n     [425] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 79. ‘Aun que para los Tamemes\r\n     hizieron los de Motecçuma choças de paja ... y aun les\r\n     tenian mugeres.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 97. ‘Los Indios\r\n     hizieron de presto muchas barracas,’ says Herrera, who\r\n     places this ‘casa de plazer’ in the plain below. dec. ii.\r\n     lib. vii. cap. iii. Tapia calls the buildings ‘casas de\r\n     paja.’ _Relacion_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 578.\r\n\r\n     [426] Martin Lopez was the watchful sentinel. _Torquemada_,\r\n     i. 443.\r\n\r\n     [427] _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii.\r\n     577; _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 80. Herrera intimates that an\r\n     attack on the summit, where the Spaniards were benumbed\r\n     with cold, might have succeeded in creating confusion. dec.\r\n     ii. lib. vii. cap. iii. Unless the naked Indians had been\r\n     equally benumbed!\r\n\r\n     [428] He appealed to the Tlascaltecs by his side, and\r\n     they declared that they knew him to be Tzihuacpopoca.\r\n     _Torquemada_, i. 446.\r\n\r\n     [429] A load being at least 50 pounds, the bribe swells to\r\n     over $5,000,000.\r\n\r\n     [430] Cortés and Martyr call the envoy a brother of\r\n     Montezuma. _Cartas_, 79; dec. v. cap. ii.; Gomara and\r\n     Herrera, a relative. _Hist. Mex._, 98; dec. ii. lib. vii.\r\n     cap. iii. According to Bernal Diaz, the bribe is offered by\r\n     four nobles at Tlalmanalco. _Hist. Verdad._, 64. Sahagun, who\r\n     is the original authority for the story of ‘Tzioacpupuca’s’\r\n     attempt to pass himself off for Montezuma, says that Cortés\r\n     was highly indignant at the deception, ‘y luego con afrenta\r\n     enviaron á aquel principal y á todos los que con él habian\r\n     venido.’ _Hist. Conq._, 19; _Torquemada_, i. 445-6.\r\n\r\n     [431] _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, 20-1; _Acosta_, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, 519-20; _Torquemada_, i. 447. Solis, the ‘penetrating\r\n     historian,’ repeats and improves upon this as an account\r\n     taken from ‘autores fidedignos.’ _Hist. Mex._, i. 353. And\r\n     with a similar belief it has been given a prominent place\r\n     in _West-vnd Ost-Indischer Lustgart_, 131. Gaspar Ens L.,\r\n     the author, was one of the editors of the famous set of De\r\n     Bry, from which he like so many others borrowed text, if\r\n     not engravings. The narrator of several individual European\r\n     travels, he also issued the _Indiæ Occidentalis Historia_,\r\n     Coloniæ, 1612. The German version, published at Cöllen in\r\n     1618 in a small quarto form, under the above title, has\r\n     for its guiding principle the appropriate maxim of Horace,\r\n     _Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci_. The first\r\n     part, relating to America in general, is divided into three\r\n     sections, for physical and natural geography and Indian\r\n     customs, followed by discovery, voyages, and conquests,\r\n     and concluding with a review of political history, and an\r\n     appendix on missionary progress. This arrangement, however,\r\n     is nominal rather than real, and the confusion, extending\r\n     into chapters as well as sections, is increased by the\r\n     incomplete and undigested form of the material, enlivened,\r\n     however, by an admixture of the quaint and wonderful.\r\n\r\n     [432] ‘Ya estamos para perdernos ... mexicanos somos,\r\n     ponernos hemos á lo que viniese por la honra de la\r\n     generacion.... Nacidos somos, venga lo que viniere.’\r\n     _Sahagun_, _Hist.

Torquemada, who contradicts himself about the\r\n     visit, describes with some detail the reception at this\r\n     capital, where the population kneel to adore the Spaniards\r\n     as children of the sun.

What with the retreating\r\n     waters and the removal of native lords in whose interest\r\n     it lay to preserve the gardens and palaces, her glories\r\n     are now departed. The evaporation of the lake waters had\r\n     been observed before the conquest. After this it increased\r\n     rapidly, owing to the thoughtless destruction of forests\r\n     in the valley, as Humboldt remarks. In Bernal Diaz’ time\r\n     already Iztapalapan lay high and dry, with fields of maize\r\n     growing where he had seen the busy traffic of canoes. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 65. The fate of the lake region was sealed by\r\n     the construction of the Huehuetoca canal, which drained the\r\n     big lake to a mere shadow of its former self, leaving far\r\n     inland the flourishing towns which once lined its shore, and\r\n     shielding the waters, as it were, from further persecution\r\n     by an unsightly barrier of desert salt marshes—and all to\r\n     save the capital from the inundations to which blundering\r\n     locators had exposed her. Humboldt has in his map of the\r\n     valley traced the outline of the lake as it appeared to the\r\n     conquerors, and although open to criticism it is interesting.\r\n     _Essai Pol._, i. 167, 173-5.\r\n\r\n     [451] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 82. Bernal Diaz reduces it to 2000\r\n     pesos. According to Sahagun, Cortés summons the lords of the\r\n     district and tells them of his mission. The common people\r\n     keep out of the way, fearing a massacre. _Hist. Conq._,\r\n     21-2. Brasseur de Bourbourg, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 205-6,\r\n     assumes from this that many of the chiefs promised to support\r\n     Cortés against the government, which is hardly likely to\r\n     have been done in a city ruled by Montezuma’s brother, who\r\n     was at heart hostile to the Spaniards. Here again, says\r\n     Herrera, dec. ii. lib. vii. cap. v., Montezuma sought to\r\n     dissuade Cortés from entering the capital; _Torquemada_,\r\n     i. 449. His envoy being Cacama, adds Ixtlilxochitl, _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 295.\r\n\r\n     [452] _Hist. Verdad._, 64-5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMEETING WITH MONTEZUMA.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER, 1519.\r\n\r\n     SOMETHING OF THE CITY—THE SPANIARDS START FROM\r\n     IZTAPALAPAN—REACH THE GREAT CAUSEWAY—THEY ARE MET BY MANY\r\n     NOBLES—AND PRESENTLY BY MONTEZUMA—ENTRY INTO MEXICO—THEY ARE\r\n     QUARTERED IN THE AXAYACATL PALACE—INTERCHANGE OF VISITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Iztapalapan the imperial city of the great plateau could clearly\r\nbe seen, rising in unveiled whiteness from the lake. Almost celestial\r\nwas its beauty in the eyes of the spoilers; a dream some called it,\r\nor, if tangible, only Venice was like it, with its imposing edifices\r\nsparkling amid the sparkling waters. Many other places had been so\r\ncalled, but there was no other New World Venice like this.\r\n\r\nSweeping round in sheltering embrace were the green swards and\r\nwood-clad knolls on the shore, studded with tributary towns and\r\npalatial structures, crowned with foliage, or peeping forth from\r\ngroves, some venturing nearer to the city, and into the very lake.\r\n“We gazed with admiration,” exclaims Bernal Diaz, as he compares with\r\nthe enchanted structures described in the Amadis their grand towers,\r\ncues, and edifices, rising in the lake, and all of masonry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us glance at the people and their dwellings; for though we have\r\nspoken of them at length elsewhere, we cannot in this connection\r\nwholly pass them by.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries back, the Aztecs, then a small and despised people,\r\nsurrounded and oppressed by enemies, had taken refuge on some islets\r\nin the western part of the saline lake of Mexico, and there by divine\r\ncommand they had founded the city which, under the title of Mexico\r\nTenochtitlan, was to become the capital of Anáhuac. The first building\r\nwas a temple of rushes, round which the settlement grew up, spreading\r\nrapidly over the islets, and on piles and filled ground. The city\r\nwas enlarged and beautified by successive rulers, and when first\r\nbeheld by the Spaniards it had attained its greatest extent—one it\r\nnever again approached—and was reputed to be about twelve miles in\r\ncircumference. This area embraced a large suburb of several villages\r\nand towns with independent names, containing in all sixty thousand\r\nhouses, equivalent to a population of three hundred thousand.[453]\r\n\r\nFour great avenues, paved with hard cement, ran crosswise from the\r\ncardinal points, and divided the city into as many quarters, which\r\nwere again subdivided into wards.[454]\r\n\r\nThree of the avenues were connected in a straight line, or nearly\r\nso, with the main land by means of smooth causeways, constructed of\r\npiles filled up with rubble and débris. The shortest of these was the\r\nwestern, leading to Tlacopan, half a league distant, and bordered all\r\nthe way with houses. They were wide enough for ten horsemen to ride\r\nabreast, and were provided at intervals with bridges for the free\r\nflow of water[455] and of traffic. Near their junction with the city\r\nwere drawbridges, and breastworks for defence. A fourth causeway,\r\nfrom the Chapultepec summer palace, served to support the aqueduct\r\nwhich carried water from the mountain spring in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nRound the southern part of the city stretched a semicircular levee,\r\nthree leagues in length and thirty feet in breadth, which had been\r\nconstructed in the middle of the preceding century to protect the\r\nplace from the torrents which after heavy rains came rushing from the\r\nfresh-water lakes of Xochimilco and Chalco. This levee was the chief\r\nresort of the people—during the day for bustling merchants and boat\r\ncrews, during the evening for promenaders, who came to breathe the\r\nfresh air soft-blown from the lake, and to watch the setting sun as\r\nit gilded the summits of Popocatepetl and his consort.\r\n\r\nTraffic, as may be supposed, was conducted chiefly by canals guarded\r\nby custom-houses, lined with quays, and provided in some places with\r\ndocks. Upon these abutted narrow yet well lighted cross streets,\r\nconnected by bridges, and leading to a number of open squares, the\r\nlargest of which were the market-places in Tlatelulco and Mexico\r\nproper, wherein as many as one hundred thousand people are said to\r\nhave found room.\r\n\r\nViewed architecturally and singly, the buildings did not present a\r\nvery imposing appearance, the greater portion being but one story in\r\nheight. This monotony, however, was relieved to a great extent by the\r\nnumber of temples sacred to superior and local deities which were to\r\nbe seen in every ward, raised high above the dwellings of mortals,\r\non mounds of varying elevations, and surmounted by towering chapels.\r\nTheir fires, burning in perpetual adoration of the gods, presented a\r\nmost impressive spectacle at night. The grandest and most conspicuous\r\nof them all was the temple of Huitzilopochtli, which stood in the\r\ncentre of the city, at the junction of the four avenues, so as to be\r\never before the eyes of the faithful. It formed a solid stone-faced\r\npyramid about 375 feet long and 300 feet broad at the base, 325 by\r\n250 feet at the summit, and rose in five superimposed, perpendicular\r\nterraces to the height of 86 feet. Each terrace receded six feet from\r\nthe edge of the one beneath, and the stages were so placed that a\r\ncircuit had to be made of each ledge to gain the succeeding flight,\r\nan arrangement equally suited for showy processions and for defence.\r\nSurrounding the pyramid was a battlemented stone wall 4800 feet in\r\ncircumference, and through this led four gates, surmounted by arsenal\r\nbuildings, facing the four avenues.[456]\r\n\r\nThe pyramid was quite modern, and owed its erection to Ahuitzotl, who\r\nfor two years employed upon it an immense force of men, bringing the\r\nmaterial from a distance of three or four leagues. It was completed in\r\n1486, and consecrated with thousands of victims. The rich and devout\r\nbrought, while it was building, a mass of treasures, which were buried\r\nin the mound as an offering to the gods, and served subsequently as a\r\npowerful incentive for the removal of every vestige of the structure.\r\nThe present cathedral occupies a portion of the site.[457]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the city was likewise improved by terraces of various\r\nheights serving as foundation for the dwellings of rich traders, and\r\nof the nobles who were either commanded to reside at the capital or\r\nattracted by the presence of the court. Their houses were to be seen\r\nalong the main thoroughfares, differing from the adobe, mud, or rush\r\nhuts of the poor, in being constructed of porous tetzontli stone,\r\nfinely polished and whitewashed. Every house stood by itself, separated\r\nby narrow lanes or by gardens, and inclosing one or more courts.\r\nBroad steps led up the terrace to two gates, one opening on the main\r\nstreet, the other on the back lane or canal. The terrace platform was\r\nparticularly spacious in front, where occasionally a small oratorio\r\nfaced the entrance. The façade was adorned with elegant cornices and\r\nstucco designs of flowers and animals, often painted in brilliant\r\ncolors. Balconies were occasionally to be seen, supported on monolith\r\ncolumns without base or capital, though with incised ornamentation;\r\nbut they were not common, owing to the prevalence of flat roofs\r\nsurrounded by battlemented and even turreted parapets. Behind them\r\nrose flowering plants, arranged in pots or growing in garden plots,\r\nand aiding to render the spot attractive for the family gathering in\r\nthe evening. Flower-gardens might be seen also in the courts, with\r\na sparkling fountain in the centre. Around ran the shady porticos,\r\nlined with suites of apartments, the larger reception rooms in front,\r\nthe stores and kitchen in the rear, and other rooms and chambers,\r\nwith the never failing temazcalli, or bath, arranged between them,\r\nand provided with wicker screens or curtains in lieu of doors.\r\n\r\nCourts as well as rooms were covered with flags of stones, tessellated\r\nmarble or cement, polished with ochre or gypsum; and the walls were\r\ndecorated not infrequently with porphyry, jasper, and alabaster, and\r\nhung with cotton tapestry adorned with feather and other ornaments.\r\nThe furniture on the other hand was scanty, consisting chiefly of\r\nmats of palm leaves, cushions, low tables, and stools.[458]\r\n\r\nIt was in the morning of the 8th of November that the Spaniards\r\nmustered for the entry into Mexico. Not far from Iztapalapan they\r\ncame upon the longest causeway, two leagues in extent, which with\r\nthe exception of a short angle near the shore led in a straight line\r\nnorthward to the heart of the city.[459] They passed several towns,\r\nsome on the shore, others touching the causeway,[460] and supported\r\nto a great extent by the manufacture of salt from the lake water.\r\nThe causeway had been reserved for the passage of the troops, out of\r\ndeference to the desire manifested to keep the natives at a respectful\r\ndistance,[461] but both sides were lined with canoes bearing an eager\r\ncrowd of sight-seers. About half a league from the city the causeway\r\nformed a junction with the road from Xochimilco and Coyohuacan, at a\r\nspot called Acachinanco,[462] where a stout battlemented wall, fully\r\nten feet in height, and surmounted by two towers, guarded the two\r\ngates for entry and exit.\r\n\r\nEntering here the Spaniards were met by a procession of over one\r\nthousand representative people from the capital,[463] richly arrayed\r\nin embroidered robes, and with jewelry of pendent stones and gold.\r\nThese passed before the visitors in a file, touching the ground with\r\ntheir hand and carrying it to the lip in token of reverence. This\r\nceremony occupied an hour, after which the march was resumed. At\r\nthe junction of the causeway with the main avenue of the city was a\r\nwooden bridge ten paces wide, easily removable, inside of which Cortés\r\nhalted to await the emperor, then approaching.[464] On either side of\r\nthe street, closely along by the houses, came processions of nobles,\r\nheaded by lords and court dignitaries, all of whom marched with bare\r\nfeet and bowed heads. This humility was owing to the presence of the\r\nemperor, who in almost solitary grandeur kept the centre of the road,\r\nborne in a richly adorned litter on the shoulders of his favorite\r\ncourtiers, and followed by a few princes and leading officials.[465]\r\nThree dignitaries preceded him, one of whom bore aloft three wands,\r\nsignifying the approach of the imperial head of the tripartite\r\nalliance, so that all persons in sight might lower their heads in\r\nhumble reverence till he had passed.\r\n\r\nOn nearing the Spaniards Montezuma stepped from the litter, supported\r\non either side by King Cacama and Cuitlahuatzin, his nephew and\r\nbrother, and followed by the king of Tlacopan and other princes. Four\r\nprominent caciques held over his head a canopy profusely covered with\r\ngreen feathers set with gold and silver, and precious stones, both\r\nfixed and pendent, and before them attendants swept the road and\r\nspread carpets, so that the imperial feet might not be soiled. The\r\nmonarch and his supporters were similarly dressed, in blue _tilmatlis_\r\nwhich, bordered with gold and richly embroidered and bejewelled, hung\r\nin loose folds from the neck, where they were secured by a knot. On\r\ntheir heads were mitred crowns of gold with _quetzal_ plumes, and\r\nsandals with golden soles adorned their feet, fastenings embossed\r\nwith gold and precious stones.[466]\r\n\r\nMontezuma was about forty years of age, of good stature, with a thin\r\nthough well-proportioned body, somewhat fairer than the average hue\r\nof his dusky race. The rather long face, with its fine eyes, bore\r\nan expression of majestic gravity, tinged with a certain benignity\r\nwhich at times deepened into tenderness. Round it fell the hair in\r\na straight fringe covering the ears, and met by a slight growth of\r\nblack beard.[467]\r\n\r\nWith a step full of dignity he advanced toward Cortés, who had\r\ndismounted to meet him. As they saluted,[468] Montezuma tendered a\r\nbouquet which he had brought in token of welcome, while the Spaniard\r\ntook from his own person and placed round the neck of the emperor a\r\nshowy necklace of glass, in form of pearls, diamonds, and iridescent\r\nballs, strung upon gold cords and scented with musk.[469] With\r\nthese baubles, which were as false as the assurances of friendship\r\naccompanying them, the great monarch deigned to be pleased, for if\r\nevery piece of glass had been a diamond they would have possessed no\r\ngreater value in his eyes. As a further expression of his good-will,\r\nCortés offered to embrace the monarch, but was restrained by the two\r\nprinces, who regarded this as too great a familiarity with so sacred a\r\nperson.[470] The highest representative of western power and grandeur,\r\nwhose fame had rung in the ears of the Spaniards since they landed\r\nat Vera Cruz, thus met the daring adventurer who with his military\r\nskill and artful speech had arrogated to himself the position of a\r\ndemi-god.\r\n\r\nAfter an interchange of friendly assurances the emperor returned to the\r\ncity, leaving Cuitlahuatzin to escort the general.[471] The procession\r\nof nobles now filed by to tender their respects, whereupon the march\r\nwas resumed to the sound of drums and wind instruments. At the head\r\nwere scouts on horseback, followed by the cavalry, under Cortés, who\r\nhad by his side two large greyhounds; then came the infantry, with\r\nthe artillery and baggage in the centre; and last, the allies.[472]\r\nThe streets, which had been deserted by the people out of deference\r\nto the emperor and to the requirements of his procession, were now\r\nalive with lookers-on, particularly in the entrances to the alleys,\r\nin the windows, and on the roofs.[473]\r\n\r\nAt the plaza, wherein rose the great pyramidal temple surrounded on\r\nall sides by palatial edifices, the procession turned to the right, and\r\nCortés was led up the steps of an extensive range of buildings, known\r\nas the Axayacatl palace, which faced the eastern side of the temple\r\ninclosure.[474] Here Montezuma appeared, and through a court-yard\r\nshaded by colored awnings and cooled by a playing fountain he conducted\r\nhim by the hand into a large hall. An attendant came forward with a\r\nbasket of flowers, wherein lay “two necklaces made of the shell of\r\na species of red crawfish,” so they said, and “much esteemed by the\r\nnatives, from each of which hung eight crawfish of gold, wrought with\r\ngreat perfection, and nearly as large as the span of a hand.”[475]\r\nThese the emperor placed round the neck of the general, and presented\r\nat the same time wreaths to his officers. Seating him upon a gilt\r\nand bejewelled dais,[476] he announced that everything there was at\r\nhis disposal; every want would be attended to. Then with delicate\r\ncourtesy he retired, so that the Spaniards might refresh themselves\r\nand arrange their quarters.\r\n\r\nThe building contained several courts, surrounded by apartments,\r\nmatted and furnished with low tables and _icpalli_ stools. Everything\r\nabout the place was neat and of a dazzling whiteness, relieved by\r\ngreen branches and festoons. The finer rooms were provided with\r\ncotton tapestry, and adorned with figures in stucco and color, and\r\nwith feather and other ornaments set with gold and silver fastenings.\r\nHere and there were vases with smouldering incense diffusing sweet\r\nperfume. So large was the place that even the allies found room.\r\nThe halls for the soldiers, accommodating one hundred and fifty men\r\neach, were provided with superior beds of mats, with cotton cushions\r\nand coverlets, and even with canopies. Cortés was glad to find the\r\nbuilding protected by strong walls and turrets, and after arranging the\r\nmen according to their corps, he ordered the guns to be planted and\r\nthe sentinels posted, issuing also instructions for the considerate\r\ntreatment of the natives, and for intercourse generally. Meanwhile\r\nthe servants had spread a dinner, which Bernal Diaz describes as\r\nsumptuous.[477]\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Montezuma reappeared with a large suite. Seating\r\nhimself beside Cortés,[478] he expressed his delight at meeting such\r\nvaliant men, whose fame and deeds had already aroused his interest\r\nduring their visits in the two preceding years at Potonchan and\r\nChalchiuhcuecan. If he had sought to prevent their entry into the\r\ncapital, it was solely because his subjects feared them, with their\r\nanimals and thunder; for rumors had described them as voracious beings,\r\nwho devoured at one meal what sufficed for ten times the number of\r\nnatives, who thirsted for treasures and who came only to tyrannize.\r\nHe now saw that they were mortals, although braver and mightier than\r\nhis own race, that the animals were large deer, and that the caged\r\nlightning was an exaggeration. He related the Quetzalcoatl myth,[479]\r\nand expressed his belief that they were the predicted race, and\r\ntheir king the rightful ruler of the land. “Hence be assured,” said\r\nhe, “that we shall obey you, and hold you as lord lieutenant of the\r\ngreat king, and this without fail or deceit. You may command in all\r\nmy empire as you please, and shall be obeyed. All that we possess is\r\nat your disposal.”[480]\r\n\r\nCortés expressed himself as overwhelmed with these kind offers and\r\nwith the many favors already received, and hastened to assure the\r\nemperor that they were not misplaced. He and his men came indeed from\r\nthe direction of the rising sun, and their king, the mightiest in the\r\nworld, and the ruler of many great princes, was the one he supposed.\r\nHearing of the grandeur of the Mexican monarch, their master had\r\nsent the former captains, brethren of theirs, to examine the route,\r\nand to prepare the way for the present commission. He had come to\r\noffer him the friendship of their great king, who wished in no wise\r\nto interfere with his authority, but rather that his envoys should\r\nserve him and teach the true faith.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Montezuma’s grandeur led the emperor evidently\r\nto suppose that the rumors concerning him current in the outlying\r\nprovinces might have reached the ears of the Spanish king, for he now\r\nalluded to the tales which raised him to a divine being inhabiting\r\npalaces of gold, silver, and precious stones. “You see,” he added\r\nwith a sad smile, wherein seemed to linger regrets arising from his\r\ndeparting glory, “that my houses are merely of stone and earth; and\r\nbehold my body,” he said, turning aside his vestment, “it is but of\r\nflesh and bone, like yours and others. You see how they have deceived\r\nyou. True, I possess some gold trinkets left me by my forefathers;\r\nbut all that I have is yours whenever you may desire it.”[481]\r\n\r\nCortés’ eyes sparkled with satisfaction as he expressed his thanks. He\r\nhad heard of Montezuma’s wealth and power, and had not been deceived\r\nin the expectation, for a more magnificent prince he had not met\r\nwith during his entire journey. Such fine words must be rewarded. At\r\na sign the attendants came forward with a rich collection of gold,\r\nsilver, and feather ornaments, and five thousand to six thousand\r\npieces of cloth, most fine in texture and embroidery.[482] Being asked\r\nwhat relationship the men bore to one another, Cortés said that all\r\nwere brothers, friends, and companions, with the exception of a few\r\nservants.[483]\r\n\r\nMontezuma afterward elicited from the interpreters who the officers and\r\ngentlemen were, and in conferring favors he sent them more valuable\r\npresents through the mayordomo, while the rest obtained inferior\r\ngifts by the hand of servants.[484] At his departure from the Spanish\r\nquarter the soldiers with redoubled alacrity fell into line to salute\r\na prince who had impressed them both with his gentle breeding and\r\nhis generosity, and the artillery thundered forth a salvo, partly to\r\ndemonstrate that the caged lightning was a fearful reality.[485]\r\n\r\nThe following forenoon Cortés sent to announce that he would make a\r\nreturn visit, and several officers came to escort him. Arrayed in his\r\nfinest attire, with Alvarado, Velazquez de Leon, Ordaz, Sandoval, and\r\nfive soldiers, he proceeded to the residence of Montezuma, in the new\r\npalace as it has been called, situated in the south-east corner of\r\nthe great temple plaza.[486] If they had admired the palace forming\r\ntheir own quarter, how much more charmed were they with this, “which\r\nhas not its equal in Spain,” exclaims Cortés.\r\n\r\nThe exterior presented an irregular pile of low buildings of\r\n_tetzontli_, raised upon high foundations, and communicating with the\r\nsquare by twenty doors, over which were sculptured the coat of arms\r\nof the kings of Mexico. The buildings were so arranged as to inclose\r\nthree public squares, and contained an immense number of rooms and\r\nhalls, one of them large enough to hold three thousand men, it is\r\nsaid. Several suites were reserved for royal visitors, envoys, and\r\ncourtiers, while others were assigned for the emperor’s private use,\r\nfor his harem and his attendants. Large monoliths adorned the halls\r\nor supported marble balconies and porticos, and polished slabs of\r\ndifferent kinds of stone filled the intervening spaces or formed the\r\nfloors. Everywhere, on projections and supports, in niches and corners,\r\nwere evidences of the artist’s skill in carvings and sculptures,\r\nincised and in relief.\r\n\r\nAfter being conducted through a number of courts, passages, and\r\nrooms, partly for effect, the Spaniards were ushered into the\r\naudience-chamber, and removed their hats as Montezuma advanced to\r\nreceive them. Leading Cortés to the throne, he seated him at his\r\nright hand, the rest being offered seats by the attendants. Around\r\nstood with downcast eyes a number of courtiers, who in accordance with\r\netiquette had covered their rich attire with a coarse mantle and left\r\ntheir sandals outside the room.[487] The conversation fell chiefly\r\non religious topics, the favorite theme with Cortés, who aside from\r\nhis bigotry was not averse to use the faith as a means to obtain a\r\nsecure hold on the people. In any case it afforded a shield for other\r\nobjects. He explained at length the mysteries of Christianity, and\r\ncontrasted its gentle and benevolent purposes with those of the idols,\r\nwhich were but demons intent on the destruction of their votaries,\r\nand trembling at the approach of the cross. Aware of the inefficiency\r\nof himself and his interpreters as preachers, indicated indeed by the\r\npassive face of the proposed convert, Cortés concluded by intimating\r\nthat his king would soon send holy men, superior to themselves, to\r\nexplain the truths which he had sought to point out. Meanwhile he\r\nbegged the emperor to consider them, and to abandon idols, sacrifices,\r\nand other evils. “We have given him the first lesson, at any rate,”\r\nsaid Cortés, turning to his companions.[488]\r\n\r\nThe ruler of a superstitious people, himself a high-priest and leader\r\nof their bloody fancies, was not to be touched by this appeal of\r\nCortés. The prejudices of a lifetime could not be so easily disturbed.\r\nHe had well considered the words, he replied, transmitted already\r\nfrom the sea-shore by his envoys, and had found many of the points\r\nidentical with those held by his people; but he preferred not to dwell\r\non the subject at present. The god depicted was doubtless good; so\r\nwere their own, for to them they and their forefathers owed health\r\nand prosperity. Suffice it that he believed his guests to be the\r\nmen predicted to come. “As for your great king,” he added, “I hold\r\nmyself as his lieutenant, and will give him of what I possess.” As a\r\ntangible proof thereof, he again before dismissing them distributed\r\npresents, consisting of twenty packs of fine robes and some gold-ware\r\nworth fully one thousand pesos.[489]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [453] The ruins of the old city, clearly traced by Humboldt,\r\n     showed that it must have been of far greater extent than\r\n     the capital raised upon its site by the Spaniards. This is\r\n     also indicated by the size of the markets and temple courts.\r\n     The reason is to be found partly in the former prevalence\r\n     of one-story houses with courts inclosed.\r\n\r\n     [454] For ancient and modern names of quarters see _Native\r\n     Races_, ii. 563.\r\n\r\n     [455] Cortés believed that the waters ebbed and flowed,\r\n     _Cartas_, 102-3, and Peter Martyr enlarged on this phenomenon\r\n     with credulous wonder. dec. v. cap. iii.\r\n\r\n     [456] For a description of the interior see _Native Races_,\r\n     ii. 582-8.\r\n\r\n     [457] Ramirez and Carbajal Espinosa define the limits\r\n     pretty closely with respect to the modern outline of the\r\n     city, _Hist.

Mex. 1845), ii. app. 103; but Alaman, in his\r\n     _Disert._, ii. 202, 246, etc., enters at greater length\r\n     into the changes which the site has undergone since the\r\n     conquest, supporting his conclusions with quotations from\r\n     the _Libro de Cabildo_ and other valuable documents.\r\n\r\n     [458] For further description of streets, buildings, and\r\n     people, see _Native Races_, passim.

Doc._, xiii. 339.\r\n\r\n     A curious view of Mexico is given in the edition of Cortés’\r\n     letters issued at Nuremberg in 1524, which exhibits six\r\n     causeway connections with the mainland. Both in situation,\r\n     with respect to the surrounding towns, and in the general\r\n     plan, it accords very fairly with the descriptions of the\r\n     conquerors. The temple of Huitzilopochtli occupies an immense\r\n     square in the centre of Temixtitan, as the city is called.\r\n     Round the south-east corner extend the palace and gardens\r\n     of the emperor, other palaces being scattered on the lake,\r\n     and connected with the suburbs by short causeways. Less\r\n     correct in its relative position is the view presented in\r\n     the old and curious _Libro di Benedetto Bordone_, which\r\n     has been reproduced in _Montanus_, _Nieuwe Weereld_, 81,\r\n     so famous for its cuts, and, of course, with considerable\r\n     elaborations which by no means promote the correctness,\r\n     however much the beauty of aspect is improved.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: ANCIENT MEXICO. TAKEN FROM AN EDITION OF\r\n         THE LETTERS OF CORTÉS PUBLISHED AT LUXEMBURG A.D.\r\n         M.D.XX.VIII.]\r\n\r\n     Very similar to this is the view given in some of Solis’\r\n     editions, that of Antwerp, 1704, for instance, wherein is\r\n     also found a view of Mexico with its surrounding towns, as\r\n     Cuitlahuac, Iztapalapan, and others, all grouped closely\r\n     together within the main lake! A native plan of the capital,\r\n     said to have been given by Montezuma to Cortés, accords\r\n     little with Spanish descriptions, and is difficult to\r\n     understand from its peculiar outline, illustrated with Aztec\r\n     hieroglyphics. Alaman doubts its origin and correctness.\r\n     See _Prescott’s Mex._ (Mex. ed. 1844), ii. 157. A good copy\r\n     of it is given in _Carbajal Espinosa_, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 221.\r\n\r\n     The view in _Libro di Benedetto Bordone_, _Nel qual si\r\n     ragiona de tutte l’Isole del mondo_, Vinegia, 1528, 73\r\n     leaves, is accompanied by an interesting description of _La\r\n     gran citta di Temistitan_, remarkable from being perhaps the\r\n     first sketch of any value given in a cosmographic work. It\r\n     occupies the greater part of folios vi. to x., devoted to\r\n     the _terra da Ferdinando Cortese_. Five more folios describe\r\n     the West Indies and Venezuela region, the only portions of\r\n     America known to Bordone when he wrote his book. It was\r\n     completed in 1521, according to its pontifical license,\r\n     although not issued till 1528. The versatile author, who\r\n     figured both as artist and professor, died in 1531, and the\r\n     later issues of the _Libro_, henceforth called _Isolario_,\r\n     are by editors whose endeavor to keep apace with the demands\r\n     of the times is instanced by the edition of 1537, wherein\r\n     appears a letter on the conquest of Peru. In the mappemonde\r\n     of the first edition before me, the smaller northern part\r\n     of the new continent is called _terra del laboratore_,\r\n     while the southern part bears the inscription _ponẽti môdo\r\n     nouo_. The two are separated at the Isthmus, in about the\r\n     latitude of the Mediterranean, by a long strait, at the\r\n     eastern mouth of which, on the sectional map of folio vi.,\r\n     is written, _stretto pte del mõdo nouo_. Farther east lie\r\n     the islands _Astores_, _Asmaide_, and _Brasil_. The numerous\r\n     sectional wood-cut maps and plans bear the conventional\r\n     outline of a series of concave segments, and of the ten\r\n     referring to different parts of the new world, seven apply\r\n     to the Antilles.\r\n\r\n     The clearest account of Mexico given by any of the conquerors\r\n     is to be found in _Relatione d’alcvne cose della Nuoua\r\n     Spagna, & della gran città di Temistitan Messico, fatta\r\n     per vn gentil’huomo del Signor Fernando Cortese_, wherein\r\n     the description of the natives, their manners and customs,\r\n     their towns, the resources of the country, and above all,\r\n     the capital city, is to be found in concise form, arranged\r\n     in paragraphs with appropriate headings, and illustrated by\r\n     a cut of the great temple, which appears far more correct\r\n     than those given by most subsequent writers. A view of the\r\n     capital is also appended, showing the surrounding country,\r\n     and according very nearly with those of the Nuremberg type,\r\n     except in the faulty relative position to the neighborhood.\r\n     Nothing is known of the author, who is generally referred\r\n     to as the Anonymous Conqueror, but the opinion has been\r\n     hazarded that he was Francisco de Terrazas, mayordomo of\r\n     Cortés. His account was evidently written in Spanish, but\r\n     did not see the light till Ramusio issued it in Italian\r\n     under the above title. It forms one of the most valuable\r\n     documents for the history of Mexico to be found in this\r\n     prized collection of voyages and travels, the first large\r\n     work of its class. No branch of literature obtained a\r\n     greater stimulus from the discovery of Columbus. He it\r\n     was who broke the barrier which had confined the ardor of\r\n     voyagers, and who led the revival of maritime enterprise,\r\n     creating a curiosity among the stayers-at-home that could\r\n     be satiated only with repeated editions of narratives\r\n     relating to expeditions and conquests. The number of these\r\n     narratives became, within a few years, so large as to\r\n     require their grouping into special collections for the\r\n     sake of cheapness and convenience. The earliest is probably\r\n     the _Paesi Nouamente retrouati, Et Nouo Mondo da Alberico\r\n     Vesputio_; By Fracanzo or Fracanzano da Montalboddo, Vicenza,\r\n     1507, mentioned by _Tiraboschi_, _Storia della literatura\r\n     italiana_. This was reproduced in 1508 by Madrignani, at\r\n     Milan. According to Panzer, Ruchamer issued the same year a\r\n     somewhat fuller collection at Nuremberg, under the title of\r\n     _Newe Unbekanthe landte Und eine Newe weldte_, with eight\r\n     pieces, among them the voyages of Columbus, Ojeda, Pinzon,\r\n     and Vespucci. A similar work was issued by the Italian\r\n     Angiolelo, in 1519.\r\n\r\n     The best known of these early collections, and by many\r\n     regarded as the first issued in German, is the _Novus Orbis\r\n     Regionvm ac Insolarvm Veteribvs Incognitarvm; Basileæ apvd\r\n     Io Hervagivm, Mense Martio, anno_ M.D.XXXII., 4to, 584\r\n     pages, beside unnumbered leaves. ‘La plus ancienne de ces\r\n     (Latin) collections,’ says Boucher, _Bibl. Univ._, i. 55.\r\n     Although prepared by John Huttich, the canon of Strasbourg,\r\n     it is better known under the name of Simon Grynæus, who\r\n     wrote the introductory and revised it at the request of\r\n     Hervagius, the publisher, a well known bookman, greatly\r\n     esteemed by Erasmus. Meusel, _Bibl. Hist._, iii. pt. i. 221,\r\n     gives it with punctilious fairness the title of _Collectio\r\n     Huttichio-Grynæo-Hervagiana_, while others apply only the\r\n     middle name or the last two. The attribution to Grynæus\r\n     is greatly due to his fame as a reformer, as the personal\r\n     friend of Luther and Calvin, as the discoverer of Livy’s\r\n     lost books, and as the first of a long line of scholars\r\n     celebrated under that name. It is an excellently printed\r\n     volume, with quaint head-pieces, and containing as it does\r\n     so many papers of which the original editions are now lost,\r\n     the collection must be esteemed of great value. The nineteen\r\n     pieces of original contributions, journals, and borrowed\r\n     accounts, include the voyages of Columbus, Alonso, and\r\n     Pinzon from _Madrignani_; _Alberici Vesputij nauigationum\r\n     epitome_, and _nauigationes IIII._; and _Petri Martyris de\r\n     insulis_. The other narratives relate to Asia, to the Levant,\r\n     and to Russia. With some copies is found a mappemonde, but\r\n     the only genuine one, according to Harrisse, 294, bears\r\n     the inscription _Terra de Cuba_, in the northern part of\r\n     the new world, and in the south, _Parias, Canibali America\r\n     Terra Nova, Prisilia_, with the word _Asia_ in large type.\r\n     Among the several editions the German of 1534, by Herr, is\r\n     rarer than the above original, while the Dutch of 1563, by\r\n     Ablijn, is the most complete.\r\n\r\n     After Huttich the voyage collections increased rapidly\r\n     in number and size, till they reached the fine specimen\r\n     of Ramusio, forming not only the first large work of this\r\n     class, but, for a long time, the most extensive which bears\r\n     on America. Harrisse, 457, very justly observes that ‘the\r\n     publication of Ramusio’s _Raccolta_ may be said to open\r\n     an era in the literary history of Voyages and Navigation.\r\n     Instead of accounts carelessly copied and translated from\r\n     previous collections, perpetuating errors and anachronisms,\r\n     we find in this work original narrations judiciously\r\n     selected, carefully printed, and enriched with notices which\r\n     betray the hand of a scholar of great critical acumen.’ The\r\n     first issue appeared as _Primo Volvme Delle Navigationi\r\n     et Viaggi. In Venetia appresso gli heredi di Lvcantonio\r\n     Givnti, 1550_, folio, 405 leaves. ‘Les Juntes (le) publièrent\r\n     ... sous la direction de Jean-Baptiste Ramusio.’ _Camus_,\r\n     _Mém. Coll. Voy._, 7. Neither in this, nor in the third\r\n     volume, issued in 1553, nor in the second edition of the\r\n     first volume, 1554, does the name of Giambatista Ramusio,\r\n     Rannusio, or Rhamusio, appear as author, and it is only\r\n     in the second volume that the publisher, Tommaso Giunti,\r\n     resolves to set aside the modesty of his friend, and to\r\n     place his name upon the title-page. The publication of this\r\n     volume had been delayed till 1559, owing to the death of\r\n     the author and to the burning of the printing establishment.\r\n\r\n     In the preface Giunti refers to the close friendship\r\n     between them, and extols Ramusio as a learned man, who\r\n     had served in foreign countries, acquiring in this way a\r\n     perfect knowledge of French and Spanish. He had long been\r\n     a devoted student of history and geography, inspired to\r\n     some extent by the travels of his uncle, the celebrated\r\n     Doctor Girolamo Ramusio. As secretary to the powerful\r\n     Venetian Council ‘de Signori Dieci,’ he was in a position\r\n     to maintain correspondence with such men as Oviedo, Cabot,\r\n     Cardinal Bembo, and others, part of which is to be found\r\n     in _Lettere di XIII. Huomini illustri_, Venetia, 1565. All\r\n     this served him in the formation of the great work upon\r\n     which he labored during the last 34 years of his life. He\r\n     died at Padua, July 10, 1557, 72 years of age.\r\n\r\n     The first volume relates chiefly to Asia and Africa, but\r\n     contains _Lettere due_ and _Sommario_ by Vespucci, and\r\n     four papers on Spanish and Portuguese circumnavigation.\r\n     The contents of the set have been somewhat changed and\r\n     increased during the several republications, but the best\r\n     editions are those of 1588, 1583, and 1565, for the first,\r\n     second, and third volume respectively. Vol. ii. of this set\r\n     relates chiefly to Asia, but is of interest to American\r\n     students for its narrative of the much doubted voyages\r\n     of the brothers Zeno. Its small size indicates the loss\r\n     it sustained by the events above referred to. ‘Et nõ vi\r\n     marauigliate, se riguardando gli altri due, non uedrete\r\n     questo Secõdo volume, si pieno & copioso di scrittori, come\r\n     il Ramusio già s’haueua pposto di fare, che la morte ui\r\n     s’interpose.’ ii. 2.\r\n\r\n     The third volume is entirely devoted to America, and contains\r\n     all the most valuable documents known up to the time of\r\n     its first issue, such as the relations of Martyr, Oviedo,\r\n     Cortés, and his contemporaries in Mexico, Pizarro, Verazzano,\r\n     Carthier, the _Relation di Nvnno di Gvsman_, in several\r\n     parts, and the valuable _Relatione per vn gentil’huomo del\r\n     Signor Fernando Cortese_. The volume begins with a learned\r\n     discourse by Ramusio on ancient knowledge of a land to\r\n     the west, and of causes leading to the discovery. At the\r\n     end of the 1565 edition is a map of America, showing Lower\r\n     California as a wide peninsula, and _Terra del Fuego_ joined\r\n     to the land of the _Circolo Antartico_. The comparative\r\n     crudeness of the wood-cuts and maps has not made the\r\n     work much esteemed by collectors, but its value even now,\r\n     for reference, is unquestioned. The set was dedicated to\r\n     Hieronimo Fracastoro, the great poet and physician, born\r\n     mouthless, yet so eloquent. _Scaliger_, _Aræ Fracastoreæ_.\r\n     At the end of the _Discorso sopra Perv_, iii. 371, Ramusio\r\n     says: ‘Et questa narratione con breuità habbiamo voluto\r\n     discorrere per satisfattione de i lettori, laquale piu\r\n     distintamente legeranno nel quarto volume.’ According to\r\n     Fontanini, _Bibl._, 274, the material for this volume lay\r\n     prepared in manuscript, only to perish in the disastrous\r\n     fire of November, 1557.\r\n\r\n     [459] It is still one of the main roads, known under Spanish\r\n     dominion as Calzada de Iztapalapan, now as S. Antonio Abad.\r\n\r\n     [460] Cortés names the well built Mexicaltzinco, Niciaca,\r\n     and Huchilohuchico (now Churubusco), to which he gives\r\n     respectively 3000, 6000, and 4000 to 5000 families. _Cartas_,\r\n     83-4. Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 99, names Coioacan instead of\r\n     Niciaca, and this change is generally accepted, for the\r\n     latter name is probably a mistake by the copyist or printer.\r\n     _Peter Martyr_, dec. v. cap. iii.\r\n\r\n     [461] ‘Mandò que vn Indio en lengua Mexicana, fuesse\r\n     pregonando que nadie se atrauessasse por el camino, sino\r\n     queria ser luego muerto.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vii.\r\n     cap. v.\r\n\r\n     [462] Also referred to as Fort Xoloc. ‘En donde hoy la\r\n     garita de _San Antonio Abad_,’ says Ramirez, in _Prescott_\r\n     (ed. Mex. 1845), ii. 104.\r\n\r\n     [463] Herrera, who is usually moderate, swells the figure\r\n     to 4000.\r\n\r\n     [464] The avenue is now called el Rastro. The suburb here\r\n     bore the name of Huitzitlan. ‘_Vitzillan_ que es cabe el\r\n     hospital de la Concepcion.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, 23. At\r\n     Tocititlan, says Duran, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 439. ‘Junto\r\n     de la Hermita de San Anton.’ _Torquemada_, i. 450. ‘Segun\r\n     una antigua tradicion conservada en el hospital de Jesus, el\r\n     punto en que le encontró fué frente á éste, y por recuerdo\r\n     del suceso se hizo la fundacion en aquel parage.’ _Alaman_,\r\n     _Disert._, i. 103; and _Ramirez_, note in _Prescott_ (ed.\r\n     Mex. 1845), ii. 103. The previous authorities indicate,\r\n     however, that the meeting took place farther from the centre\r\n     of the city.\r\n\r\n     [465] Chimalpain mentions among others Tetlepanquezatl,\r\n     king of Tlacopan, Yzquauhtzin Tlacochcalcatl, lord or\r\n     lieutenant of Tlatelulco, captain-general Atlixcatzin,\r\n     son of Ahuitzatl, and Tepehuatzin, son of Titotzin. _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, 125. Sahagun differs slightly in the names. _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, 24-5.\r\n\r\n     [466] For dress, see _Native Races_, ii. 178 et seq.\r\n     Cortés gives sandals only to Montezuma, but it appears that\r\n     persons of royal blood were allowed to retain them before\r\n     the emperor, as Ixtlilxochitl also affirms. _Hist. Chich._,\r\n     295; _Oviedo_, iii. 500; _Purchas, His Pilgrimes_, iv. 1121.\r\n\r\n     [467] ‘Cenzeño ... y el rostro algo largo, è alegre.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 67. ‘Motecçuma quiere dezir hõbre\r\n     sañudo y graue.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 103; _Acosta_,\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, 502-3. It is from this, probably, that so many\r\n     describe him as serious in expression. A number of portraits\r\n     have been given of the monarch, differing greatly from\r\n     one another. The best known is Prescott’s, taken from the\r\n     painting for a long time owned by the Condes de Miravalle,\r\n     the descendants of Montezuma; but this lacks the Indian\r\n     type, and partakes too much of the ideal. Clavigero’s,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 8, appears more like him, though it\r\n     is too small and too roughly sketched to convey a clear\r\n     outline. Far better is the half-size representation prefixed\r\n     to _Linati_, _Costumes_, which indeed corresponds very\r\n     well with the text description. The face in _Armin_, _Alte\r\n     Mex._, 104, indicates a coarse Aztec warrior, and that in\r\n     _Montanus_, _Nieuwe Weereld_, 244-5, an African prince, while\r\n     the native picture, as given in _Carbajal Espinosa_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, ii. 6, is purely conventional. The text description,\r\n     based chiefly on Bernal Diaz, is not inappropriate to the\r\n     weak, vacillating character of the monarch. Clavigero makes\r\n     him nearly 54 years old, and Brasseur de Bourbourg 51; but\r\n     40, as Bernal Diaz calls him, appears to be more correct.\r\n\r\n     [468] ‘Ellos y él ficieron asimismo ceremonia de besar la\r\n     tierra.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 85.\r\n\r\n     [469] ‘De margaritas y diamantes de vidrio.’ _Id._ ‘Que se\r\n     dizen margagitas.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 65.\r\n\r\n     [470] Solis assumes that Cortés was repelled when he sought\r\n     to place the necklace on Montezuma. The latter chides the\r\n     jealous princes, and permits him. _Hist. Mex._, i. 370.\r\n     ‘Pareceme que el Cortès ... le daua la mano derecha, y el\r\n     Monteçuma no la quiso, è se la diò â Cortès.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 65. This phrase, which applies equally to\r\n     offering the right hand, has been so understood by those\r\n     who notice it; but as this would be confusing, Vetancurt,\r\n     for instance, assumes improbably that Marina offers her\r\n     right hand to Montezuma, which he disregards, giving his\r\n     instead to Cortés. _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 129.\r\n\r\n     [471] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 85. Ixtlilxochitl has it that\r\n     Cacama was left with him; and Bernal Diaz, that the lord of\r\n     Coyuhuacan also remained. According to Cortés, Montezuma\r\n     accompanied him all the way to the quarters in the city,\r\n     keeping a few steps before. Gomara and Herrera follow this\r\n     version. But Bernal Diaz states explicitly that he left the\r\n     Spaniards to follow, allowing the people an opportunity to\r\n     gaze; and Ixtlilxochitl assumes that he goes in order to\r\n     be ready to receive him at the quarters. _Hist. Chich._,\r\n     295. It is not probable that Montezuma would expose himself\r\n     to the inconvenience of walking so far back, since this\r\n     involved troublesome ceremonies, as we have seen, not only\r\n     to himself but to the procession, and interfered with the\r\n     people who had come forth to gaze. The native records state\r\n     that Montezuma at once surrendered to Cortés the throne and\r\n     city. ‘Y se fueron ambos juntos á la par para las casas\r\n     reales.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, 23-4. Leading Cortés\r\n     into the Tozi hermitage, at the place of meeting, he made\r\n     the nobles bring presents and tender allegiance, while he\r\n     accepted also the faith. _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii.\r\n     440-1.\r\n\r\n     [472] About 6000 in all. ‘Nosotros aun no llegauamos á 450\r\n     soldados.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 65. Prescott\r\n     places the number at about 350.\r\n\r\n     [473] According to Sahagun not a soul was to be seen,\r\n     either upon the causeway or along the streets, the people\r\n     having taken this manner to express their indignation at\r\n     the semi-forcible entry of the Spaniards. Montezuma came to\r\n     receive them purely out of a feeling of humanity. Startled\r\n     at this solitude, Cortés fears dangers, and vows, if all\r\n     goes well, to build a church. This was the origin, says\r\n     Bustamante, of the Hospital de Jesus. _Sahagun_, _Hist.\r\n     Conq._ (ed. Mex. 1840), 79-84. See note 12, this chapter.\r\n     Brasseur de Bourbourg accepts this view. _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 212-13. Still Sahagun describes the interview\r\n     with Cortés as most cordial. He is in fact contradictory,\r\n     and it is evident that the order issued to the people to\r\n     keep the narrow causeway clear, and the etiquette which\r\n     required them to give way to the emperor, have been hastily\r\n     interpreted by the chronicler into ‘deserted streets’ and\r\n     ‘popular indignation.’ Had the citizens objected to receive\r\n     the strangers, the bridges could have been raised against\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     [474] ‘Au coin de la rue _del Indio triste_ et de celle de\r\n     Tacuba,’ says Humboldt, _Vues_, i. 58, prudently, without\r\n     attempting to give its extent. Ramirez and Carbajal do\r\n     so, however, and in allowing it about the same length\r\n     as the temple inclosure, they place it right across the\r\n     eastern avenue of the city, which like the other three is\r\n     admitted to have terminated at one of the temple gates.\r\n     _Carbajal Espinosa_, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 222; _Ramirez_,\r\n     notes in _Prescott’s Mex._ (ed. Mex. 1845), ii. app. 103.\r\n     ‘Donde hoy las Casas de el Marqués del Valle,’ says Lorenzana, in\r\n     _Cortés_, _Hist. N. Esp._, 86, a statement disputed by later\r\n     writers. Prescott quotes Humboldt, but evidently does not\r\n     understand him, for he places the palace ‘facing the western\r\n     gate,’ which is not only on the wrong side, but across\r\n     the western avenue. _Mex._, ii. 79. ‘Adonde ... tenia el\r\n     gran Monteçuma sus grandes adoratorios de idolos ... nos\r\n     lleuaron á aposentar á aquella casa por causa, que como nos\r\n     llamauã Teules, é por tales nos tenian, que estuuiessemos\r\n     entre sus idolos.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 66. The\r\n     idea of being regarded as a god seems to have pleased the\r\n     old soldier immensely.\r\n\r\n     [475] They doubtless formed a double necklace, with gold\r\n     setting and pendants. Cortés writes that on the way to\r\n     the palace Montezuma halted to place them round his neck.\r\n     _Cartas_, 85; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 100-1; _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist. Conq._, 23.\r\n\r\n     [476] ‘A throne of gold,’ is Peter Martyr’s briefer yet\r\n     grander term. dec. v. cap. iii.\r\n\r\n     [477] _Hist. Verdad._, 65-6; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. vii.\r\n     cap. v.; _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, 25-6.\r\n\r\n     [478] Bernal Diaz states that the emperor always addressed\r\n     him as Malinche, and, indeed, it was common among Mexicans\r\n     to address persons by a name given them in later life in\r\n     connection with some peculiarity, deed, or incident. Hence\r\n     Cortés, as master of the prominent female interpreter,\r\n     received a name implying that relationship.\r\n\r\n     [479] For which see _Native Races_.\r\n\r\n     [480] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 86. This is in substance the\r\n     speech of Montezuma, as given by native as well as Spanish\r\n     records; yet it appears improbable that the emperor should\r\n     have been so ready, at the first interview, and in presence\r\n     of his courtiers, to humble himself so completely before\r\n     a few strangers whom he regarded as mortals. See note 19.\r\n     ‘Myself, my wife and children, my house, and all that I\r\n     possess, are at your disposal,’ says the Spaniard, even in\r\n     our day, to the guest whom he wishes to impress with his\r\n     hospitality. Perhaps Montezuma was equally profuse with\r\n     hollow words, which have been recorded as veritable offers.\r\n\r\n     [481] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 86-7. Bernal Diaz introduces this\r\n     paragraph during the next interview.\r\n\r\n     [482] _Id._ ‘Á cada vno de nuestros Capitanes diò cositas\r\n     de oro, y tres cargas de mantas de labores ricas de plumas,\r\n     y entre todos los soldados tambien nos diò á cada vno á\r\n     dos cargas de mantas.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 66;\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 101-2; _Peter Martyr_, dec. v. cap.\r\n     iii.; _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 441-2; _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. vii. cap. vi.; _Torquemada_, i. 452-3;\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 296; _Peralta_, _Not.\r\n     Hist._, 107-8. Acosta implies that Cortés now reconciled\r\n     the Tlascaltecs with the Aztecs. _Hist. Ind._, 521.\r\n\r\n     [483] ‘Eramos hermanos en el amor, y amistad, é personas mui\r\n     principales,’ is the way Bernal Diaz expresses it. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 66.\r\n\r\n     [484] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 102-3. ‘Los haçia proveer\r\n     luego, assi de mugeres de serviçio, como de cama, é les\r\n     daba á cada uno una joya que pessaba hasta diez pessos de\r\n     oro.’ _Oviedo_, iii. 500-1.\r\n\r\n     [485] _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 129. Sahagun,\r\n     followed by Acosta, Brasseur de Bourbourg, and others, states\r\n     that the artillery was discharged at night to startle the\r\n     natives. _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 85.\r\n\r\n     [486] It is so depicted in the old Nuremberg view of the\r\n     city, already referred to. Ramirez, Carbajal Espinosa,\r\n     and Alaman give the extent, and the latter enters into\r\n     quite a lengthy account of its situation with respect to\r\n     present and former outlines of the quarter. _Disert._, ii.\r\n     202, etc.; _Carbajal Espinosa_, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 221-2;\r\n     _Ramirez_, notes in _Prescott’s Mex._ (ed. Mex. 1845), ii.\r\n     app. 103. Humboldt places it opposite the southern half of\r\n     the western temple side, _Essai Pol._, i. 190, but that site\r\n     is assigned by all the above historians to the old palace\r\n     of Montezuma, so called—not the Axayacatl where Cortés was\r\n     quartered. The mistake is probably owing to his ignorance\r\n     of the fact that the residence of the Cortés family stood\r\n     first on the site of the new palace of Montezuma, whence\r\n     it was moved to that of the old palace when the government\r\n     bought the former.\r\n\r\n     [487] The Spaniards were also ‘costretti a scalzarsi, ed\r\n     a coprirsi gli abiti sfarzosi con vesti grossolane,’ says\r\n     Clavigero, _Storia Mess._, iii. 83, but that is unlikely.\r\n\r\n     [488] ‘Con esto cumplimos, por ser el primer toque.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 67.\r\n\r\n     [489] ‘Â nosotros los soldados nos diò á cada vno dos\r\n     collares de oro, que valdria cada collar diez pesos, è dos\r\n     cargas de mantas.’ The rest went to their officers. _Id._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF THE EMPEROR.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER, 1519.\r\n\r\n     CORTÉS INSPECTS THE CITY—VISITS THE TEMPLE WITH\r\n     MONTEZUMA—DISCOVERY OF BURIED TREASURE—PRETENDED EVIDENCES\r\n     OF TREACHERY—CORTÉS PLANS A DARK DEED—PREPARATIONS FOR\r\n     THE SEIZURE OF MONTEZUMA—WITH A FEW MEN CORTÉS ENTERS THE\r\n     AUDIENCE-CHAMBER OF THE KING—PERSUASIVE DISCOURSE—WITH GENTLE\r\n     FORCE MONTEZUMA IS INDUCED TO ENTER THE LION’S DEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCortés failed not to make diligent inquiries and examinations into\r\nthe approaches, strength, and topography of the city, but he longed\r\nfor a view from one of the great temples which, rising high above all\r\nother edifices, would enable him to verify his observations. He also\r\ndesired to obtain a closer insight into the resources of the place.\r\nWith these objects he sent to Montezuma for permission to make a tour\r\nthrough the town to the Tlatelulco market and temple.[490] This was\r\ngranted; and attended by the cavalry and most of the soldiers, all\r\nfully armed, Cortés set out for that suburb, guided by a number of\r\ncaciques. It was here that the largest market-place in the city was\r\nsituated.[491]\r\n\r\nFrom this centre of trade the Spaniards proceeded to the lofty temple,\r\nwhich occupied one end of the Tlatelulco market-place,[492] and whither\r\nMontezuma had already gone to prepare for their reception, and to\r\npropitiate the idols for the intrusion by prayers and sacrifices.\r\nHe hoped, no doubt, that his presence would prove a check upon the\r\nimpulsive hands and tongues of the guests. Dismounting at the gate,\r\nthe riders advanced with most of the soldiers through the temple\r\ncourt, and climbed the one hundred and more steps which led to the\r\nsummit. Some priests and chiefs had been sent by Montezuma to assist\r\nCortés to ascend, but he preferred to trust to himself. This pyramid,\r\nunlike that in Mexico proper, appears to have had but one continuous\r\nstair-way leading up the western slope.[493] The first sight which\r\nmet the Spaniards on reaching the summit was the sacrificial cage\r\nfor holding victims, and a large snake-skin drum, whose sombre tones\r\ngave appropriate effect to the horrible rites enacted around it.\r\n\r\nMontezuma came out of one of the chapels to welcome them, expressing\r\na fear that they must have been fatigued by the ascent, but Cortés\r\nhastened to assure him that Spaniards never tired. Calling their\r\nattention to the view here afforded of the city and its surroundings,\r\nhe stood silent for a while to let the beauteous vision work its own\r\nenchantment. Around on every side spread the lake and its connecting\r\nwaters, bordered with prairies and fields. Forests and towns\r\nintermingled on the green carpet, and extended far away till they\r\ndisappeared in the shadows of the hills. The soldiers recognized the\r\nsettlements and towns which they had passed, and saw the causeways\r\nwhich on three sides connected with the mainland. Beneath them lay\r\na vast expanse of terraced roofs, intersected by streets and canals\r\nteeming with passengers and canoes. Here and there rose palatial\r\nedifices and towering temples, interspersed with open squares, and\r\nwith gardens shaded by trees and relieved by the silvery jets of the\r\nfountain. At their feet lay the market through which they had just\r\npassed, alive with busy Lilliputians, whose talk and cries reached\r\ntheir ears in a confused murmur. Cortés could not fail to be impressed\r\nby scenes so varied and so attractive, but the æsthetic aspect was\r\nin him speedily overshadowed by the practical sense of the military\r\nleader. Then rose on high his soul as he thought to secure for Spain\r\nso rich an inheritance as the great city with its vast population,\r\nand turning to Father Olmedo he suggested that the site ought to be\r\nobtained for a church; but the prudent friar remonstrated that the\r\nemperor appeared to be in no mood to listen to such a proposal.\r\n\r\nCortés accordingly contented himself with asking to see the idols, and\r\nafter consulting the priests Montezuma led them past the piscina with\r\nthe vestal fire into the chapel. Withdrawing a tasselled curtain he\r\ndisplayed the images, glittering with ornaments of gold and precious\r\nstones, which at first drew the attention of the beholders from the\r\nhideous form and features. Before them stood the stone of sacrifice,\r\nstill reeking with gore, and around lay the instruments for securing\r\nthe human victim and for tearing open the breast. On one altar could\r\nbe seen three hearts, and on the other five, offered to the idols,\r\nand even now warm and palpitating with life. The interior walls were\r\nso smeared with human blood as to obscure their original color, and\r\nto emit a fetid odor which made the Spaniards glad to reach the open\r\nair again.\r\n\r\nForgetting his prudence, Cortés expressed his wonder to Montezuma\r\nthat so great and wise a prince should worship abominable demons\r\nlike these. “Let me but plant a cross on this summit,” he said, “and\r\nwithin the chapel place an image of the virgin, and you shall behold\r\nthe fear of the idols.” The eyes of the priests were at this aflame\r\nwith anger, and the emperor could hardly suppress his indignation as\r\nhe replied, “Malinche, had I suspected that such insults were to be\r\noffered, I would not have shown you my gods. They are good; they give\r\nus health, sustenance, victory, and whatever we require. We adore\r\nthem, and to them make our sacrifices. I entreat you say not another\r\nword against them.” Observing the effect his remarks had produced,\r\nCortés thought it best to restrain himself, and to express regrets at\r\nhis hastiness. Then with a forced smile he said that it was time to\r\ndepart. Montezuma bade them farewell. As for himself, he must remain\r\nto appease the idols for the insult offered.[494]\r\n\r\nNot at all abashed by his rebuff at the temple, Cortés asked Montezuma\r\nto let him erect a church in his own quarters. Glad probably at finding\r\nthe Spanish pretensions in this respect so modified, he not only\r\nassented, but gave artisans to aid in the work. This was concluded\r\nwithin three days, and services henceforth held therein, at which\r\nthe Indians were always welcomed. A cross was also erected before the\r\nentrance, so that the natives might be impressed by the devotion of\r\ntheir visitors.\r\n\r\nThis effort in behalf of the faith was not to go unrequited. While\r\nlooking for the best site for the altar, says Bernal Diaz, Yañez, the\r\ncarpenter, discovered signs of a door-way recently closed and plastered\r\nover. Cortés was told of this, and ever on the guard against plots,\r\nhe ordered the wall to be opened. Aladdin on entering the cave could\r\nnot have been more surprised than the Spaniards were on stepping\r\ninto the chamber there revealed. The interior fairly blazed with\r\ntreasures; bars of gold were there, nuggets large and small, figures,\r\nimplements, and jewelry of the same metal; and then the silver, the\r\nrare bejewelled and embroidered fabrics, the prized chalchiuite and\r\nother precious stones! Cortés allowed the favored beholders to revel\r\nin the ecstasy created by the sight, but to their greed he set a\r\ncheck. He had reasons for not disturbing the treasures at this time,\r\nand gave orders to restore the wall, so that no suspicions might be\r\naroused that the deposit had been discovered.[495]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne reason with Cortés for not touching the treasures was to hold out\r\nan alluring bait to those who, more prone to listen to the warnings of\r\ntimid allies than to the ambitious promptings of their leader, were\r\never ready to take alarm and urge withdrawal from a position which\r\nthey regarded as dangerous. Unbending in his resolution, the general\r\nhad nevertheless grasped all the perils of their position. Hitherto no\r\nfirm ground existed for alarm. They had been a week in the capital,\r\nand were still receiving from all hands the kindest treatment and\r\nthe most generous hospitality. Cortés was aware, however, that this\r\ndepended on the favor of the emperor, whose power over the submissive\r\npeople resembled that of a god, and whose person appeared to them as\r\nsacred as his will was absolute. He had also learned that this monarch\r\nwas a man affrighted by his superstitions, and often influenced by\r\ntrifling circumstances; ready to strike where he had fawned the moment\r\nbefore, and little bound by words or pledges, particularly when they\r\ninvolved his own sovereignty. One misstep by the Spanish leader or\r\nany of his men, ill-behaved and importunate as they were, according to\r\nhis own statement, might precipitate the change. The presence of the\r\nhated Tlascaltecs was itself a burden, and the drain for supporting\r\nthe self-invited guests would soon be felt. The religious topic had\r\nalready created a momentary irritation, which might rankle and grow\r\nunder the promptings of the priests, who must naturally object to\r\nrival interference.\r\n\r\nEmperor and subjects were evidently restrained only by the military\r\nprestige of the Spaniards, and to some extent by the belief in their\r\ndivine mission; but they were also aware that, whatever might be the\r\nprowess of the visitors and the power of their weapons and steeds,\r\nthey were mortals, for this had been proved quite lately by the\r\nunfortunate defeat of Escalante, and in the Nautla campaign. The\r\nsoldiers of Montezuma had but to raise the bridges of the causeways\r\nand cut off retreat, then stop supplies and reduce them by starvation.\r\nTrue, there was the fate of Cholula before the Mexicans; but they\r\nhad gained experience, and could mass vastly more warriors and arms,\r\nwhile the Spaniards would have no allies in reserve to operate in the\r\nrear. Besides, what mattered the destruction of a part, or even of\r\nthe entire city, when thereupon depended the safety of the throne,\r\nmenaced by a horde of cruel, avaricious monsters!\r\n\r\nCortés had considered all these points, and knew the expediency of\r\nresolute action. He had undertaken an enterprise wherein one bold\r\nmove must be supported by another, and to these all means had to be\r\nsubordinate. He had not come all this way to place himself within\r\nthe power of a suspicious and vacillating despot, nor to waste his\r\ntime in waiting for what events might bring forth, while his enemies,\r\nheaded by Velazquez, were arranging for his overthrow. He had formed\r\nhis plans long beforehand, as indicated in his first letter to the\r\nking, wherein he promised to have the great Montezuma “a prisoner,\r\na corpse, or a subject to the royal crown of your Majesty.”[496]\r\nConquest, followed by settlement and conversion, was his aim. It\r\nwould not pay him to play for a smaller stake.\r\n\r\nJust now rumors began to circulate tending to stir anew the fears\r\nwhich Montezuma’s friendly and hospitable demeanor had soothed. One\r\nwas that the nobles had actually prevailed on the emperor to break\r\nthe bridges, to arm the whole city, and to fall on the Spaniards with\r\nall available strength.[497] Soldiers were readily found who fancied\r\nthat the mayordomo was less obsequious than formerly, and that he\r\ngave scantier supplies. It was also understood from Tlascaltecs that\r\nthe populace appeared less friendly during the last day or two. These\r\nreports may have sprung wholly from timid minds still agitated by the\r\nwarnings uttered by Tlascaltecs before the departure from Cholula,\r\nor they may have been promoted by Cortés himself in furtherance of\r\nhis plans. He at any rate seized the pretence to hold a council,\r\ncomposed of Alvarado, Leon, Ordaz, and Sandoval, together with twelve\r\nsoldiers whose advice he most valued, “including myself,” says Bernal\r\nDiaz. His chief reason was to persuade them of the necessity for the\r\nmeasure he had resolved on, and to win their hearty coöperation. Laying\r\nbefore them the current rumors which confirmed the warnings formerly\r\nreceived, and representing the unreliable and suspicious character\r\nof Montezuma, his great power, and the peculiar position and strength\r\nof the city, he concluded by proposing the daring venture of seizing\r\nthe emperor and holding him a hostage.[498]\r\n\r\nHere was folly run mad! Four hundred men, after penetrating formidable\r\nbarriers and gaining the very heart of a great empire, whose vast\r\narmies could oppose a thousand warriors to every Spaniard there,\r\ncoolly propose to take captive the worshipped monarch of this vast\r\nrealm, and then to defy its millions of subjects! The wildest tales\r\nof mediæval knights hardly equal this project. Reckless as was the\r\nconception, it was the fruit of yet greater audacity. Cortés reared\r\nhis structure of folly insensate upon the platform of still greater\r\ninsensate folly. If it was true that he had practically placed himself\r\nin the position of a captive, then he would cut the knot by capturing\r\nthe captor. And yet, foolhardy as might appear the scheme when coolly\r\nviewed from the isle of Cuba, situated as the Spaniards were, it was\r\ndoubtless the best they could do; it was doubtless all they could do.\r\nThe efficiency of hostages had been frequently tried by the conquerors\r\nin the Antilles, and the opportune seizure of the Cempoalan lord had\r\nnot been forgotten; but this had been effected under the impulse of\r\nthe moment, while the chieftain was surrounded by Spaniards. Here\r\nwas required not only a calm resolution, unflinching to the end, but\r\na well laid stratagem. Cortés stood prepared with both.\r\n\r\nProducing the letter from Villa Rica, which had been kept secret all\r\nthis time, he gave an account of the unfortunate successes at Almería,\r\ndescribing in exaggerated terms the treachery of Quauhpopoca, and\r\nconsequently of Montezuma as his master, and stirring the feelings\r\nof the council by an appeal to avenge their comrades.[499] Here was\r\na pretence[500] which served also to set aside the suggestion that\r\nthe emperor would be only too glad to let them depart in peace,\r\nfor it was argued that a retreat now, since the Spaniards stood\r\nrevealed as mortals, would draw upon them not only the contempt of\r\nallies and countrymen, but a general uprising, with the most fatal\r\nresults. Retreat meant also the surrender of all hopes of wealth,\r\npreferment, and honor, to be followed by punishment and disgrace for\r\ntheir irregular proceedings so far. With Montezuma in their power,\r\nthey possessed a hostage whose sacredness in the eyes of his subjects\r\ninsured their safety, and made the people pliable to their will, while\r\ndisaffected vassals could be secured by alliances, or by the promise\r\nof reforms. Should the seizure result in the monarch’s death, the\r\nsuccession would doubtless become the cause of division and dissension,\r\nin the midst of which the Spaniards might influence affairs in their\r\nown interest. Thus were answered the various objections raised.\r\n\r\nAs for the manner of seizure, the safest plan would doubtless be to\r\ninveigle Montezuma to their quarters and there detain him; but this\r\nwould cause delay, and might arouse suspicion,[501] and, since prompt\r\naction was considered necessary, the best way would be to seize him in\r\nhis own palace. This was agreed upon, and the same evening the facts\r\nand arguments were effectively presented to the men and preparations\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n“All night,” writes Bernal Diaz, “we passed in earnest prayer, the\r\npriests devoutly imploring God to so direct the undertaking that it\r\nmight redound to his holy service.”[502]\r\n\r\nIn the morning Cortés sent to announce that he would visit the emperor.\r\nHe then despatched a number of small parties as if for a stroll,\r\nwith orders to keep themselves in and near the palace, and on the\r\nway to it, ready for any emergency. Twenty-five soldiers were told to\r\nfollow him, by twos and threes, into the audience-chamber, whither he\r\npreceded them with Alvarado, Sandoval, Velazquez de Leon, Francisco\r\nde Lugo, and Ávila.[503] All were armed to the teeth,[504] and as the\r\nMexicans had been accustomed to see them thus equipped no suspicions\r\nwere aroused. Montezuma proved on this occasion to be particularly\r\ngracious, and after a brief chat he offered several presents of finely\r\nwrought gold, and to Cortés he presented one of his daughters, the\r\ncaptains being given women of rank from his own harem, which was a\r\nmark of great favor.[505] Cortés sought to decline for himself the\r\nfavor, on the ground that he could not marry. Montezuma nevertheless\r\ninsisted, and he yielded not unwillingly.[506]\r\n\r\nAssuming a serious tone, the latter now produced the letter from\r\nVilla Rica, and informed the emperor that he had received an account\r\nof the outrageous conduct of Quauhpopoca, resulting in the death of\r\nsome of his men, and that he, the sovereign, had been accused of being\r\nthe instigator. Montezuma gave an indignant denial,[507] and Cortés\r\nhastened to assure him that he believed the charge to be false, but\r\nas commander of a party he had to account for the men to his king,\r\nand must ascertain the truth. In this Montezuma said he would aid\r\nhim; and calling a trusted officer, he gave him a bracelet from his\r\nwrist bearing the imperial signet—a precious stone graven with his\r\nlikeness[508]—bidding him to bring Quauhpopoca and his accomplices,\r\nby force, if necessary.[509] Cortés expressed himself pleased, but\r\nadded that, in order to cover his responsibility as commander, and to\r\nconvince his men that the emperor was indeed as innocent as Cortés\r\nbelieved him to be, it would be advisable for him to come and stay\r\nat their quarters till the guilty parties had been punished.[510]\r\n\r\nMontezuma was dumfounded at this unhallowed impudence. He, the august\r\nsovereign, before whom even princes prostrated themselves, at whose\r\nword armies sprang into existence, and at whose name mighty rulers\r\ntrembled, he to be thus treated by a score of men whom he had received\r\nas guests and loaded with presents, and this in his own palace! For\r\na moment he stood mute, but the changing aspect of his countenance\r\nrevealed the agitation within. At last he exclaimed that he was not\r\nthe person to be thus treated. He would not go. They could always\r\nfind him at his palace.\r\n\r\nCortés pleaded that his presence among the soldiers was necessary,\r\nnot merely as a declaration of his innocence, but to allay the rumors\r\nwhich had reached them that he and his people were plotting for their\r\ndestruction. Montezuma again made an indignant denial; but added\r\nthat, even if he consented to go, his people would never allow it.\r\nHis refusal, insisted the general, would rouse the worst suspicions\r\nof his men, and he could not answer for their acts. Mexico might meet\r\nthe fate of Cholula, and he with it.[511]\r\n\r\nMontezuma now began to implore, and offered to surrender his legitimate\r\nchildren as hostages if he were but spared the disgrace of being made\r\na prisoner. This could not be, was the reply. The Spanish quarter was\r\nhis own palace, and he could readily persuade his subjects that he\r\nwent there for a short time of his own accord, or at the command of\r\nthe gods.[512] He would be treated with every consideration, and should\r\nenjoy his usual comfort, surrounded by favorites and councillors. The\r\nplan involved no change beyond that of residence, to a place where\r\nhe would be under secret surveillance.\r\n\r\nMontezuma still objected, and time was passing.[513] The companions\r\nof Cortés becoming nervous at this delay, Velazquez de Leon exclaimed\r\nin his stentorian voice: “Why so many words, your worship? Let us\r\neither carry him off or despatch him. Tell him that if he calls out\r\nor creates a disturbance we shall kill him!”[514] Turning in alarm\r\nto Marina, Montezuma inquired what was meant. Full of pity for the\r\ntroubled monarch, she told him that the men were becoming impatient\r\nat his delay. She besought him, as he valued his life, to accede to\r\ntheir wishes and go with them. He would be treated with all the honor\r\ndue to his rank. A glance at the frowning faces of the Spaniards\r\nconfirmed the mysterious words of the interpreter, and chilled him\r\nto the heart. He had heard too many accounts of the resolution and\r\ncruelty of these men not to believe them capable of anything. Were he\r\nto call for aid they would no doubt kill him and destroy the city;\r\nfor few as they were they had proved themselves equal to hosts of\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy monarch yielded, since it was so decreed—by the sublime\r\naudacity of this score of adventurers. The spirit of Axayacatl had\r\nevidently not survived in the son, and the prestige of his early career\r\nas military leader had dwindled to a mere shadow in the effeminate\r\nlap of court-life.[515] Summoning his attendants, he ordered a litter\r\nbrought. Everything had been quietly conducted, and since none ventured\r\nto question the emperor, his command was silently obeyed; but the\r\nmysterious interview and his agitation roused their suspicions, and\r\nthe rumor spread that something extraordinary was about to happen.\r\nWondering and murmuring crowds had already collected along the route\r\nbetween the two palaces when the emperor appeared. On seeing the\r\nsorrowing faces of the favorites who bore him, and observing how\r\nclosely it was surrounded by the Spanish soldiers who acted as guard\r\nof honor, their fears became confirmed. The distance to the quarters\r\nwas too short, however, and the news had not yet travelled far enough,\r\nto allow a serious demonstration.[516] But not long after the plaza\r\nin front of it was blocked with an excited multitude, and a number of\r\nleading personages and relatives made their way into the presence of\r\ntheir sovereign, asking with tearful eyes and knitted brows how they\r\nmight serve him. They were ready to lay down their lives to rescue\r\nhim. He assured them with a forced smile that there was no cause for\r\nalarm. Too proud to disclose his pusillanimity, he readily echoed the\r\nwords of Cortés, that he had come of his own free-will, and at the\r\nintimation of the gods, to stay awhile with his guests. He told them\r\nto calm the people with this assurance, and to disperse the gathering.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [490] They had now been four days in Mexico, without going\r\n     farther than the palace, says Bernal Diaz. A page named\r\n     Orteguilla, who had already acquired a smattering of Aztec,\r\n     was sent with the interpreters to ask this favor. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 69.\r\n\r\n     [491] Soldiers who had been in Rome and Constantinople\r\n     declared that never had they seen so large and orderly a\r\n     market, with so large an attendance. Bernal Diaz indicates\r\n     the site of the plaza to have been where the church of\r\n     Santiago de Tlatelulco was erected, and this still remains\r\n     under the same name, over a mile north-west-by-north of\r\n     the central plaza of Mexico. _Hist. Verdad._, 70-1. The\r\n     old maps of Mexico already spoken of give the same site,\r\n     and Alaman’s investigations point out correctly the street\r\n     which led and leads to it, although he has failed to notice\r\n     the above authorities, which give the very site. _Disert._,\r\n     ii. 282-5.\r\n\r\n     [492] It has been generally accepted that the temple in\r\n     the centre of the city was visited, but Bernal Diaz, who\r\n     is the only narrator of this excursion, states distinctly,\r\n     in several places, that the pyramid ascended was situated\r\n     in the Tlatelulco market-place, ‘adonde está aora señor\r\n     Santiago, que se dize el Tlatelulco.’ _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     70-1. The description of the temple court and interior\r\n     is somewhat confused, and evidently combines points which\r\n     belong to the central temple.\r\n\r\n     [493] Hence the contradictions between descriptions and\r\n     views furnished by different chroniclers, which have so\r\n     greatly puzzled modern writers.\r\n\r\n     [494] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 70-1. Sigüenza y\r\n     Góngora, the well-known Mexican scholar of the seventeenth\r\n     century, follows Bernal Diaz. _Anotaciones Crit._, MS., 1-2.\r\n\r\n     [495] ‘No dexarian de quedar aprobechados ... y satisfacer\r\n     a su necesidad,’ says Vetancurt, who knew the avarice of\r\n     his countrymen too well to believe in denials. _Teatro_,\r\n     pt. iii. 131. Bernal Diaz says that Yañez, as the servant\r\n     of Velazquez de Leon and Lugo, revealed the discovery to\r\n     them, and they told Cortés. The soldiers all heard of it,\r\n     and came quietly to gaze on the treasures, which rumor\r\n     had already located somewhere in the palace. ‘Being then\r\n     a young man,’ says the old soldier, ‘and having never seen\r\n     such wealth, I felt sure that there was not anything like\r\n     it in the world.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 72; _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. viii. cap. ii. Tapia and Gomara state that Cortés\r\n     discovered the door-way as he was walking in his room one\r\n     evening, pondering on his plans for seizing Montezuma.\r\n     ‘Cerro la puerta ... por no escandalizar a Motecçuma, no\r\n     se estoruasse por esso su prisiõ.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     123; _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii.\r\n     579. Duran intimates that on hearing of the existence\r\n     of treasures in the palace, the Spaniards, including the\r\n     ‘Santo Clérigo,’ occupied themselves more in searching for\r\n     them than in promoting the faith. They did not find them,\r\n     however, till Montezuma revealed the hiding-place, under\r\n     the pressure of questions and, it seems, of hunger. _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, MS., ii. 445-6.\r\n\r\n     [496] He refers to this promise in the second letter to\r\n     the king, saying, ‘porque certifiqué á V. A. que lo habria\r\n     preso ó muerto ó súbdito.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 52.\r\n\r\n     [497] ‘En la verdad era así é lo tinien acordado,’ affirms\r\n     Tapia, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 579. ‘Estas\r\n     nueuas, falsas, o verdaderas,’ is the non-committing phrase\r\n     of Gomara. _Hist. Mex._, 123. Ixtlilxochitl takes firmer\r\n     ground. ‘According to an original letter in my possession,\r\n     signed by the three heads of New Spain, and written to his\r\n     Majesty the emperor, our master, they exculpate Motecuhzoma\r\n     and the Mexicans of this and other charges, declaring them\r\n     inventions of the Tlascaltecs and of some Spaniards who\r\n     feared that they would never see the hour when they might\r\n     leave the city and place in security the riches they had\r\n     obtained.’ _Hist. Chich._, 296. Clavigero adopts the view\r\n     that Cortés called for such testimony from certain chiefs\r\n     among his allies, whose dislike of the Mexicans would be sure\r\n     to prompt it. ‘Per giustificar vieppiù il suo attentato, e\r\n     muovere i suoi Spagnuoli ad eseguirlo, fece chiamar parecchie\r\n     persone principali de’ suoi alleati (la cui informazione\r\n     dovrebbe sempre essergli sospettosa).’ _Storia Mess._, iii.\r\n     90-1. Vetancurt has a story that, a drought prevailing\r\n     at the time, the Spaniards induced the heavens by means\r\n     of masses and prayers to send rain. This made the priests\r\n     and idols jealous, and the emperor was prevailed on to rid\r\n     himself of the Spaniards. The Tlascaltecs learned of the\r\n     plot and reported it. _Teatro_, pt. iii. 130.\r\n\r\n     [498] According to Bernal Diaz the members of this council\r\n     suggested not only the seizure but the reasons for it.\r\n     Cortés responded that he had not been oblivious of the\r\n     danger, but saw not how the seizure could be effected. The\r\n     captains proposed to beguile the prince to their quarter\r\n     and detain him. If Cortés hesitated they were willing to\r\n     undertake the task. The old soldier is evidently misled, as\r\n     he was in the scuttling affair, to assume too much credit\r\n     for himself and his fellow-soldiers. Cortés had no doubt\r\n     adopted his common tactics, so frequently admitted by Bernal\r\n     Diaz himself, of inspiring his comrades to suggest what he\r\n     had resolved on. This is proved by the promise made to the\r\n     emperor in his first letter, four months before, to capture\r\n     Montezuma.\r\n\r\n     [499] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 73, followed by a\r\n     number of other writers, states that the letter was received\r\n     at Mexico the morning after this meeting, but it has been\r\n     shown that he must be wrong. He mentions as one of the\r\n     statements in the letter that the Totonacs were in revolt,\r\n     and it is probable that Cortés may have said so to show\r\n     the soldiers that retreat was cut off, and that seizure\r\n     was the only recourse.\r\n\r\n     [500] As both Peter Martyr and Gomara call it.\r\n\r\n     [501] The neglect of this less speedy plan does indicate\r\n     that the rumors of danger were credited to a great extent\r\n     at least.\r\n\r\n     [502] _Hist. Verdad._, 74. Cortés in his quiet way writes\r\n     to the king that, after passing six days in the great city,\r\n     and finding that for various reasons ‘it suited the royal\r\n     interest and our safety to have this lord in my power, and\r\n     not wholly at liberty, lest he change in the proposal and\r\n     desire manifested to serve Y. H.... I resolved to seize\r\n     and place him in the quarter where I was.’ _Cartas_, 88-9.\r\n\r\n     [503] ‘Mandó que su gente dos á dos ó cuatro á cuatro se\r\n     fuesen tras él ... é con él entramos hasta treinta españoles\r\n     é los demas quedaban á la puerta de la casa, é en un patio\r\n     della,’ says Tapia, who appears to have been one of those\r\n     who entered. _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 579.\r\n\r\n     [504] ‘Cõ armas secretas,’ says Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 123,\r\n     and probably they did bear extra weapons beneath their\r\n     cloaks.\r\n\r\n     [505] ‘Y otras hijas de señores á algunos de mi compañía.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 89. But the customary mark of favor\r\n     was to give them from his harem. See _Native Races_, ii.\r\n\r\n     [506] ‘Per non dar disgusto al Re, e per avere occasione di\r\n     farla Cristiana,’ is Clavigero’s excuse for the acceptance.\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 93. Brasseur de Bourbourg, and some\r\n     other writers, assume that Cortés declined; but the original\r\n     authorities all say or intimate that he accepted. Even Cortés\r\n     himself writes in his letter to the emperor, ‘despues ... de\r\n     haberme él dado algunas joyas de oro y una hija suya,’ etc.\r\n     _Cartas_, 89. ‘Le persuadió,’ says Ixtlilxochitl, _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 290. Gomara is even more explicit, and Herrera\r\n     says that Montezuma insisted, ‘porque queria tener nietos\r\n     de hombre tan valeroso.’ dec. ii. lib. viii. cap. ii. The\r\n     affair is perhaps less important in itself than as index\r\n     to the character of Cortés, who could accept so intimate\r\n     an offer with one hand while he prepared a blow with the\r\n     other. It might also be made to indicate that Montezuma\r\n     could have had no base designs against him when he made the\r\n     uncalled-for offer of intrusting a daughter (if such she\r\n     was) to his keeping. Still the imperial character would\r\n     not have suffered had it been shown that this was but an\r\n     artifice to lull his intended victim into a false security.\r\n\r\n     [507] Some authors, like Herrera and Torquemada, say that\r\n     he denied all knowledge of the occurrence, calling it an\r\n     invention of enemies.\r\n\r\n     [508] _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 297. ‘Q̄ tenia la\r\n     figura de Vitzilopuchtli,’ Gomara, 123; and so says Bernal\r\n     Diaz. Tapia states that Montezuma told Cortés to send two\r\n     Spaniards with the messengers; but he doubtless declined\r\n     to risk two lives on such a trip. _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, ii. 583-4.\r\n\r\n     [509] ‘Ingrato rey!’ exclaims Gallo, in commenting upon\r\n     this surrender of a devoted officer. _Hombres Ilust. Mex._,\r\n     i. 318.\r\n\r\n     [510] Bernal Diaz makes Cortés accuse the emperor of\r\n     perfidy, and of having instigated the Cholula massacre.\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 74. But this he would hardly do, since\r\n     his purpose was clearly to persuade, not to arouse anger.\r\n\r\n     [511] ‘No querria començar guerra, ni destruir aquesta\r\n     Ciudad ... que si alboroto, ò vozes daua, que luego sereis\r\n     muerto de aquestos mis Capitanes, que no los traigo para\r\n     otro efeto,’ is Bernal Diaz’ blunt version. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     74.\r\n\r\n     [512] ‘Auia tenido platica de su idolo Huichilobos ...\r\n     que convenia para su salud, y guardar su vida, estar con\r\n     nosotros.’ _Id._, 75.\r\n\r\n     [513] ‘Estuuieron mas de media hora en estas platicas.’\r\n     _Id._, 74. Tapia and others say four hours, which is\r\n     unlikely.\r\n\r\n     [514] ‘Porque mas vale que desta vez asseguremos nuestras\r\n     vidas, ò las perdamos.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 75.\r\n\r\n     [515] ‘Era, ó muy falto de ánimo, ó pusilánime, ó muy\r\n     prudente.’ _Oviedo_, iii. 289. ‘En él se cumplió lo que de\r\n     él se decia, que todo hombre cruel es cobarde, aunque á la\r\n     verdad, era ya llegada la voluntad de Dios.’ _Ixtlilxochitl_,\r\n     _Rel._, 411.\r\n\r\n     [516] Bernal Diaz intimates clearly enough that no\r\n     demonstration was made till after his arrival. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 75. And so does Cortés. ‘Llorando lo tomaron\r\n     en ella [the litter] con mucho silencio, y así nos fuimos\r\n     hasta el aposento donde estaba, sin haber alboroto en la\r\n     ciudad, aunque se comenzó á mover. Pero sabido por el dicho\r\n     Muteczuma, envió a mandar que no lo hubiese; y así, hubo\r\n     toda quietud.’ _Cartas_, 90. Ixtlilxochitl, however, allows\r\n     Montezuma to stay long enough in his palace, after ordering\r\n     the litter, to enable the lords and nobles to come and\r\n     offer their services. A delay like this, which the Spaniards\r\n     certainly never could have permitted, might have given time\r\n     for the tumultuous gathering which he describes. _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 297. Prescott, in following this version, makes\r\n     the emperor so far overstep his usual dignity as to ‘call\r\n     out’ to the people to disperse. ‘Tambien detuvieron consigo\r\n     á _Itcuauhtzin_, gobernador del Tlatilulco,’ says Sahagun,\r\n     while the leading nobles ‘cuando fue preso Mocthecuzoma le\r\n     desampararon y se escondieron.’ _Hist. Conq._, 25.\r\n\r\n     The seizure has, like the equally prominent episodes of the\r\n     massacre at Cholula, and the scuttling of the fleet, aroused\r\n     no little comment in justification or condemnation. ‘Now that\r\n     I am old,’ says Bernal Diaz, ‘I stop to consider the heroic\r\n     deeds then performed, and I do say that our achievements\r\n     were not effected by ourselves, but were all brought about\r\n     by God; for what men have existed in the world who, less\r\n     than 450 soldiers in number, dared to enter into so strong\r\n     a city as Mexico, larger than Venice, and so remote from\r\n     Castile, to seize so great a lord?’ _Hist. Verdad._, 76.\r\n     ‘Never Greek or Roman, nor of other nation, since kings\r\n     exist, performed a like deed, only Fernando Cortés, to\r\n     seize Motecçuma, a king most powerful, in his own house,\r\n     in a place most strong, amid an infinity of people, while\r\n     possessing but 450 companions.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 124.\r\n     Commenting on this, Torquemada adds that ‘it was indeed a\r\n     deed for daring never seen, and must be attributed to God\r\n     rather than to human heart.’ i. 458. Solis of course fails\r\n     not to extol the genius and daring of his hero, whose deed\r\n     ‘appears rather in the light of a fable’ than in consonance\r\n     with simple history. _Hist. Mex._, i. 448. ‘A deed which\r\n     makes one tremble even to conceive, and much more to carry\r\n     out. But God had so determined it.’ _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 296. ‘History contains nothing parallel to this\r\n     event, either with respect to the temerity of the attempt, or\r\n     the success of the execution,’ etc. _Robertson’s Hist. Am._,\r\n     ii. 60. ‘An expedient, which none but the most daring spirit,\r\n     in the most desperate extremity, would have conceived.’\r\n     _Prescott’s Mex._, ii. 159. ‘An unparalleled transaction.\r\n     There is nothing like it, I believe, in the annals of the\r\n     world.’ _Helps’ Cortés_, ii. 351. Clavigero is less carried\r\n     away by the incident, for he sees therein the hand of God.\r\n     Nevertheless, he sympathizes with Montezuma. _Storia Mess._,\r\n     iii. 95, etc. Pizarro y Orellana finds the deed eclipsed\r\n     by the similar achievement, with a smaller force, under\r\n     his namesake Pizarro. _Varones Ilvstres_, 89-90. And later\r\n     Mexican writers, like Bustamante, see, naturally enough,\r\n     nothing but what is detestable in the incident, for according\r\n     to the native records which form their gospel, Montezuma\r\n     was guiltless of any base intents. Unfortunately for them,\r\n     these very records paint him a blood-thirsty despot who\r\n     punishes the slightest offence against himself, even when\r\n     merely suspected, with the most atrocious cruelty; one who\r\n     is continually seeking his aggrandizement at the expense\r\n     of inoffensive, peace-loving tribes, who oppresses not only\r\n     conquered peoples, but his own subjects, with extortionate\r\n     taxes and levies to satisfy his inordinate appetite for\r\n     pomp and for new conquests. These records also admit that he\r\n     had repeatedly sent sorcerers, if not armies, to entrap and\r\n     destroy the Spaniards. He who looked calmly on hecatombs of\r\n     his own subjects, slaughtered before his very eyes, would\r\n     not hesitate to condemn strangers for plotting against\r\n     the throne which was dearer to him than life itself. The\r\n     Spaniards may have anticipated events considerably, but there\r\n     is no doubt that numerous personages, from Cuitlahuatzin\r\n     downward, were bitterly opposed to their enforced guests, and\r\n     they would sooner or later have realized the rumors which\r\n     the allies began to circulate. Placed as he was, Cortés’\r\n     duty to himself, to the men intrusted to him, to his king,\r\n     and to the cause of religion, as then regarded, required\r\n     him to give heed to such rumors, and, after weighing their\r\n     probability, to take the precautionary measure of seizing\r\n     the monarch, since retreat not only appeared fraught with\r\n     disaster and dishonor, but would be regarded as a neglect\r\n     of opportunity and of duty. With Cortés, naught but the\r\n     first steps in assuming the conquest, and in usurping\r\n     certain credit and means, can be regarded as crimes, and\r\n     the former of these was forced upon him by circumstances of\r\n     his age and surroundings. Every project, then, conceived\r\n     by him for the advancement of his great undertaking must\r\n     redound to his genius as soldier and leader. Of course,\r\n     among these projects appear many which did not advance the\r\n     great object, and which must be condemned. But where do we\r\n     find greatness wholly free from stain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nDOUBLY REFINED DEALINGS.\r\n\r\n1519-1520.\r\n\r\n     HOLLOW HOMAGE TO THE CAPTIVE KING—MONTEZUMA HAS HIS WIVES AND\r\n     NOBLES—HE RULES HIS KINGDOM THROUGH THE SPANIARDS—THE PLAYFUL\r\n     PAGE—LIBERALITY OF THE MONARCH—THE SACRED TREASURES—CORTÉS\r\n     RESENTS THE INSULTS OF THE GUARD—DIVERSIONS—QUAUHPOPOCA, HIS\r\n     SON AND OFFICERS, BURNED ALIVE—PLANTATIONS FORMED—VILLA RICA\r\n     AFFAIRS—VESSELS BUILT—PLEASURE EXCURSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA pompous reception was accorded the imperial prisoner. With no small\r\nceremony was he conducted to apartments adjoining those of Cortés, as\r\nselected by himself, and there surrounded by all accustomed comforts\r\nand every show of greatness. At hand were his favorite wives, his\r\nmost devoted servants; he held court daily, received ambassadors,\r\nissued orders, and with the aid of his learned jurists administered\r\njustice. To outward appearance the monarch was as absolute as ever;\r\nyet Montezuma knew that his glory had departed, that the continued\r\nforms of greatness were hollow, and that his power was but the power\r\nof a puppet. He was wise enough to know that a strong man is not to\r\nbe trusted who is officiously kind to a weak one.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the power of the nation, in the hands of these insidious\r\nstrangers, was to be directed against himself. It was a cunning\r\npolicy, craftily conceived and deftly executed.\r\n\r\nCortés took care that everything round the prisoner should move\r\nsmoothly, and that his presence in the Spanish quarters should appear\r\nto the natives a voluntary rather than an enforced visit. To his more\r\nintimate lords and subjects, however, who knew better his condition,\r\nand who sometimes urged him to return to his palace, the poor captive\r\nwould say, “Ah, no! it is the will of the gods that I remain with\r\nthese men and be guided by their counsel.” But on no account must\r\nthe imperial influence be allowed for the present to decline before\r\nthe people. The deception must be continued, and the dignity of the\r\nsovereign upheld by a deferential attention as profound as that which\r\nwas shown before his imprisonment. Daily, after prayers, the Spanish\r\ngeneral came to pay his respects, attended by several of his captains,\r\nmore frequently Alvarado, Velazquez, and Ordaz, and to receive the\r\nimperial commands with respect to his comforts, pleasures, and duties.\r\nOn these occasions, and indeed whenever he appeared before the emperor,\r\nsays Bernal Diaz, Cortés set the example to his followers by doffing\r\nhis hat and bowing low, and never did he presume to sit in the royal\r\npresence until requested to do so.\r\n\r\nYet a most unpleasant reminder to the monarch of his circumscribed\r\nauthority was the ever present guard in and around his apartments.[517]\r\nThis was under the command of Juan Velazquez de Leon, who enforced the\r\nstrictest watch, particularly when it became known that Montezuma’s\r\ncourtiers lost no opportunity to urge escape, and that he lent them\r\na not unwilling ear, despite the professed desire to remain with the\r\nSpaniards. Among the several schemes with this object are mentioned\r\nbored walls, tunnels beneath the palace, and an attempt by the emperor\r\nhimself to leap from the summit of the building into a safe receptacle\r\nprepared for him.[518]\r\n\r\nEspionage was also established on the emperor in his intercourse\r\nwith courtiers, by placing in the apartment the page Orteguilla, who\r\nhad acquired a fair knowledge of Aztec. Of prepossessing appearance,\r\nagreeable and sprightly in manner, the youth became a favorite with\r\nthe captive king. Among other things, the little spy gave the monarch\r\nan insight into Spanish customs and proceedings at home and abroad,\r\ninto the power and grandeur of the Castilian king, and into the\r\nmysteries of the faith. Being constantly together they grew familiar,\r\nMontezuma delighting to play pranks on the boy, throwing aloft his\r\nhat, and laughing at his efforts to regain it. These tricks were\r\nalways followed by a liberal reward.[519]\r\n\r\nMontezuma was indeed most liberal with all who came in contact with\r\nhim, as became the character of a great and rich prince. Not only\r\njewels, robes, and curiosities, but male and female slaves, were\r\nfreely dispensed, partly no doubt with a view to secure good treatment\r\nfrom the guard. A considerate thoughtfulness and gentle manner added\r\nto his popularity, and “whenever he ordered,” says the old soldier,\r\n“we flew to obey.” The inconsiderate pride and selfishness of the\r\nindependent monarch seems to have disappeared in the prisoner, yet\r\nlike the captive hawk he was submissive only to his masters. Orteguilla\r\nkept him informed of the rank and character of the men, and became the\r\nrecognized medium for his favors. He represented, for instance, that\r\nBernal Diaz longed to be the master of a pretty maiden, and Montezuma,\r\nhaving noticed the exceeding deference of the soldier, called him,\r\nsaying that he would bestow on him a fine young woman, whom he must\r\ntreat well, for she was the daughter of a chief. He also gave him three\r\nquoits of gold and two loads of robes.[520] The gift came from the\r\nemperor’s harem, from which he frequently drew to please those whom\r\nhe delighted to honor. The vacancies thus created were filled from\r\nnoble families, who like those of more advanced countries regarded\r\nit an honor for a daughter to occupy the position of royal concubine.\r\nAfter his imprisonment Montezuma seems to have disposed of his wives\r\nquite rapidly, a number of them falling to leading Spaniards.[521]\r\nTo Cortés he offered for the second time a daughter, prettier than\r\nthe one given him on the day of his capture, but in this instance\r\nthe gift was declined in favor of Olid, who accepted her, together\r\nwith any number of presents, and was henceforth treated as a relative\r\nby her imperial father. Both she and the sister with Cortés were\r\nbaptized.[522]\r\n\r\nThe soldiers generally were by no means forgotten in the distribution\r\nof women and other gifts, and in course of time the quarter became so\r\ncrowded with male and female attendants that Cortés found it necessary\r\nto issue an order reducing the number to one female servant for each\r\nman. Informed of this, Montezuma instructed his mayordomo to provide\r\ngood accommodation and sustenance for them elsewhere.[523]\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this generosity, Cortés approached him one day regarding\r\nthe secreted treasures, which had been so long respected, but which\r\nhe desired to have in his possession. He regretted to say that his\r\ngraceless soldiers had come upon the treasure-chamber, and regardless\r\nof his instructions had abstracted a number of jewels. The emperor\r\nhastened to reassure him; perhaps he understood the hint. The contents\r\nof the chamber belonged to the gods, he said; but the gold and silver\r\nmight freely be taken so long as the rest was left.[524] He would\r\ngive more, if required. Cortés did not scruple to avail himself of\r\nthe permission, by appropriating for himself and his intimate friends\r\na large share. So charged the discontented soldiers, but the main\r\nportion appears to have been reserved for the general distribution\r\nnot long after. Although the most valuable part of this collection\r\nhad been freely surrendered, the soldiers hesitated not to seize also\r\nupon other effects, such as liquid amber and several hundred loads of\r\ncotton fabrics. Cortés wished to restore them, but Montezuma declined,\r\nsaying that he never received anything back.[525] On another occasion\r\nthe Spaniards discovered the imperial warehouse for cacao beans, the\r\nmost common currency of the country, and for some time made nightly\r\nraids on it with their Indian carriers. Cortés proposed to mete out\r\npunishment for this, but finding that Alvarado was a leading culprit,\r\nhe dropped the matter with a private reprimand.[526]\r\n\r\nMontezuma’s good nature was imposed upon in more ways than one, and\r\nwith all his kindness he could not command consideration from the\r\nrougher soldiers and sailors. One of the guard, after being requested,\r\nwith a gift, to discontinue certain unseemly acts, repeated the offence\r\nin the hope of receiving another bribe; but Montezuma now reported\r\nhim to his captain, and he was removed. Cortés, who was determined\r\nto enforce respect for the captive, inflicted severe punishment on\r\noffenders in this respect. Tired of patrol duty, Pedro Lopez said\r\none day in the hearing of Montezuma, “Confusion on this dog! By\r\nguarding him constantly, I am sick at stomach unto death!” Told of\r\nthis, the general had the man lashed in the soldiers’ hall, and this\r\nregardless of his standing as a good soldier and an archer of great\r\nskill. Another who showed insolence to the emperor was ordered hanged,\r\nbut escaped with a lashing at the intercession of the captains and\r\nof Montezuma.[527] This strictness insured respect not only for the\r\nemperor, but for Cortés, so that the quarter became most exemplary\r\nfor its good order.[528]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards united heartily with the native courtiers to entertain\r\nthe captive and to remove so far as possible whatever might remind\r\nhim of his lost liberty. He found great delight in their military\r\nexercises, which recalled the faded prowess of his youth and exhibited\r\nthe tactics which contributed so powerfully to Spanish supremacy over\r\nnative arms. He also enjoyed sports, and among games the _totoloque_\r\nwas his favorite. This consisted in throwing small golden balls at\r\npieces of the same metal set up as targets at a certain distance.\r\nFive points won the stakes. Cortés often played it with him, and\r\nAlvarado, who kept count for the general, usually marked more points\r\nthan he was entitled to. Montezuma playfully protested against such\r\nmarking, although what Cortés won he gave to the Mexican attendants,\r\nwhile Montezuma presented his gains to the Spanish guard.[529]\r\n\r\nMontezuma was at times allowed to visit his palaces, and to enjoy\r\nthe hunting-field, but these trips were of rare occurrence, owing to\r\nthe danger of popular demonstrations.[530] On such occasions, says\r\nCortés, the escort of prominent Mexicans numbered at least three\r\nthousand. The first time Montezuma requested this privilege it was for\r\nthe purpose of offering prayer and sacrifice at the great temple, as\r\nrequired by his gods, he said; and although Cortés did not like the\r\narrangement, his prisoner convinced him that this public demonstration\r\nwas necessary, in order to show the people that he was not kept in\r\ncompulsory confinement, but remained with the strangers at the order\r\nof the deity he was about to consult. Four captains were appointed\r\nto escort him with a guard of one hundred and fifty soldiers, and he\r\nwas warned that any attack upon them, or any attempt at rescue, would\r\nresult in his own death. He was carried in a rich litter, attended\r\nby a brilliant procession of nobles, and preceded, according to\r\ncustom, by a dignitary bearing the triple wand which indicated that\r\nthe emperor was approaching and demanded loyal veneration.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the temple the imperial worshipper stepped forth, leaning\r\non the arms of his relatives, and was assisted to the summit. Human\r\nsacrifices had been forbidden, and Father Olmedo came to watch over\r\nthe observance of the order; but it appears that four captives had\r\nbeen offered during the night, and despite the remonstrances of\r\nthe friar the attendant rites went on.[531] The captains thought it\r\nprudent not to exceed a protest, and congratulated themselves when\r\nthe ceremony was ended and the emperor safely back in their quarters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA fortnight after the seizure of Montezuma, Quauhpopoca arrived in\r\nthe capital, accompanied by his son and fifteen of his staff. He made\r\nhis entry with the pomp befitting a powerful governor and a relative\r\nof the sovereign, and hastened to the palace. As was customary with\r\nsubjects who were about to appear in the imperial presence, the rich\r\nrobes were covered with a coarse cloak, in token of humiliation.\r\nHis master received him with a stern countenance, and signified his\r\ndispleasure at the proceedings which under pretext of his authority had\r\ncaused loss of Spanish life. No attention was paid to explanations,\r\nand he was surrendered with his followers to the Spaniards, to be\r\ndealt with as they thought fit.[532] Cortés held a trial: he was a\r\nshrewd inquisitor, and his sentence was sure to accord with his own\r\ninterests. “Are you a vassal of Montezuma?” he asked of Quauhpopoca.\r\n“What else could I be?” was the reply. “Did you attack Spaniards\r\nby his order?” The prisoner was in a most serious dilemma. At first\r\nhe refused to implicate the emperor, but finding that his fate was\r\nsealed he confessed having acted under his orders.[533] This could\r\nnot avail him, however, for in obeying his master he had injured the\r\nsubjects and outraged the laws and majesty of the Spanish king, who\r\nwas sovereign of all, and this demanded punishment.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Spanish prestige, on which so much depended,\r\nhad suffered through the machinations of the governor, and it was\r\nconsidered necessary to restore it. Therefore it was decreed that\r\nQuauhpopoca, with his son and officers, should be burned alive in the\r\nplaza, before the palace. Cortés availed himself of the opportunity\r\nto seize all the arms in the arsenals,[534] and therewith build a\r\npyre worthy such noted offenders.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready Cortés presented himself before the emperor, and\r\nannounced with a severe tone that the evidence of the condemned showed\r\ntheir acts to have been authorized by him, and as a life called for a\r\nlife, according to Spanish laws, he deserved death. Cortés, however,\r\nloved him—for himself, his generosity, and services he loved him too\r\ndearly to let justice have its course, and would take on himself to\r\nappease its demands by a nominal punishment.[535] He then turned on his\r\nheel, while one of the soldiers clasped a pair of shackles round the\r\nprisoner’s ankles, and the mighty emperor of the Aztecs was ironed.\r\nFor a moment Montezuma stood rooted to the floor. Then he groaned\r\nwith anguish at this the greatest indignity ever offered his sacred\r\nperson. He trembled with apprehension at what might yet follow. His\r\ncourtiers were no less afflicted, and with tears in their eyes they\r\nknelt to lessen the weight at least of the shameful bonds, and with\r\nbandages to relieve the imperial limbs.[536]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the troops formed an imposing cordon in front of the palace\r\nto prevent a rescue of the condemned as they were led out and tied\r\nto the stake. Writhing with pain, yet mute as became brave warriors,\r\nwith the ascending smoke from Aztec shields and darts they rendered up\r\ntheir anguished souls. It was rare strategy thus with the offenders\r\nto destroy the means of offence. Supposing that the execution was by\r\nimperial sanction, the populace tacitly assented, gazing on the horrid\r\nspectacle with pallid faces and bated breath. Though accustomed to\r\nscenes like this in connection with their religious festivals, it\r\nappeared terrible when perpetrated by foreigners, to the dreary sound\r\nof muffled drums.[537]\r\n\r\nAll being over, Cortés reëntered the apartments of Montezuma with\r\nhis captains, and kneeling down he himself took off the fetters,\r\ndeclaring that he felt deeply grieved at the infliction, for he loved\r\nhim as a brother. The monarch became almost hysteric with joy at this\r\ndeliverance, and with falling tears he expressed himself in abject\r\nterms of gratitude, like the dog licking the hand which has chastised\r\nit. Every fresh incident reveals some new trait in the character of\r\nthis unhappy man which calls for pity or contempt. “Yet further,”\r\ncontinued Cortés, “to show my deep regard and confidence, you are\r\nnow at full liberty to return to your own house.” But Montezuma\r\nunderstood well enough that these were but words, an empty offer;\r\nindeed he had been informed by the well prompted page that, although\r\nthe general might wish to release him, the Spanish captains would\r\nnever permit it.[538] He accordingly expressed his thanks, and said\r\nthat he preferred to remain with him, giving as a reason that, were\r\nhe free, the importunities of his relatives and nobles to attack the\r\nSpaniards might prevail over his friendship for them and their king,\r\nand this would entail not only loss of life on both sides, but the\r\nruin of the city. Thereupon Cortés embraced him with every appearance\r\nof deep devotion, and said, “Next to my king you shall be king; vast\r\nas are your possessions, I will make you ruler of more and greater\r\nprovinces.”[539]\r\n\r\nWe can imagine the words by which the Spaniards might justify to\r\nthemselves the death of Quauhpopoca, but we cannot understand the\r\nobject in degrading the emperor in the eyes of his subjects—an act\r\nwhich they had hitherto been so careful to avoid—unless it was to\r\nlift themselves in their own esteem and that of the natives, far\r\nabove the highest American princes and powers, and to impress the\r\nsacredness of their persons on the minds of the Indians. Further than\r\nthis, they seemed to think some punishment of the emperor necessary,\r\neither because he had authorized the Nautla outrage, or because he\r\nhad countenanced it by neglecting to reprimand the perpetrators.\r\nAt all events, the effect was salutary, so much so that Spaniards\r\nwere to be seen wandering singly about the country without fear of\r\nmolestation.[540]\r\n\r\nThis effect, which extended also to adjoining independent provinces,\r\nenabled Cortés to carry out the long-cherished project of gathering\r\ninformation on the condition of the country, particularly its political\r\nfeeling and its mineral resources. Montezuma readily gave the aid\r\nrequested by providing maps and officials to guide the exploring\r\nparties. The first investigations were directed to the upper parts\r\nof Rio Zacatula and to Miztecapan, some eighty leagues south of the\r\ncapital, and to the northern branches of the Papaloapan, whence most\r\nof the gold was said to come.[541] The Zacatula party was headed\r\nby Pilot Gonzalo de Umbría, in compensation perhaps for the loss of\r\nhis feet at Villa Rica. He returned before the other parties, within\r\nthe forty days allowed for the trip, and brought about three hundred\r\npesos’ worth of gold dust, washed out in dishes from three rivers,\r\nby order of the cacique. Two chiefs accompanied him, bearing gold\r\npresents of nearly the same value as the dust, and offering allegiance\r\nto the Spaniards in the name of their caciques.[542] Small as was the\r\ntreasure, it afforded a substantial proof of the glowing report of\r\nUmbría. He had passed through three beautiful and fertile provinces,\r\nfilled with towns containing buildings equal to any in Spain. He\r\ndescribed a fortress finer in appearance and stronger than the castle\r\nof Búrgos, and the people of Tamazulapan as most superior in dress\r\nand intelligence.[543]\r\n\r\nAnother party, under one Pizarro,[544] proceeded south-eastward,\r\nthrough Tochtepec and Malinaltepec, both of which yielded them gold\r\ndust to the value of about three hundred pesos. Descending along\r\nthe northern fork of Papaloapan, they reached the country of the\r\nChinantecs, hostile to the Aztecs who had taken some of the border\r\ntowns. Their independence had not otherwise been affected, owing to\r\ntheir mountain fastnesses, their warlike spirit, and their formidable\r\nweapons, which were pikes about twenty feet in length. They invited the\r\nSpaniards to enter, but would not allow the Mexican escort to cross the\r\nboundary. The guides warned Pizarro not to trust himself to what they\r\ntermed a treacherous people, but after a brief hesitation he advanced\r\nand received a hearty reception. Aid was given to search for gold,\r\nof which seven hundred pesos’ worth was obtained from several rivers,\r\nmost of it in rough grains.[545] On his return he brought two chiefs,\r\nwho bore presents of gold from their chief cacique Cohuatlicamac,\r\nand tendered his allegiance on condition that the Aztecs should not\r\nbe allowed to enter the country. Finding the inhabitants so friendly\r\nand the province rich in resources, Pizarro left four of his small\r\nparty behind to establish cacao and maize plantations and to search\r\nfor more gold.[546]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe project appears to have found favor with Cortés, who besought\r\nMontezuma to form plantations for the king also in his adjoining\r\nprovince of Malinaltepec. This was at once attended to, and within\r\ntwo months four substantial houses and a vast reservoir had been\r\nconstructed, and a large tract of land brought under cultivation,\r\nthe improvements being valued at twenty thousand pesos de oro.[547]\r\n\r\nAnother important object was to find a better harbor than Villa\r\nRica, and the emperor being consulted, he at once ordered a map to\r\nbe made, which showed very accurately not only the rivers and inlets\r\nalready known to the Spaniards, between Pánuco and Tabasco, but the\r\nyet unknown Rio Goazacoalco, beyond the Mexican border. This being\r\nsaid to have a large and deep entrance, Cortés availed himself of\r\nOrdaz’ offer to examine it. Ten men, chiefly sailors and pilots, and\r\nsome guides, accompanied him, and authority was given to take escorts\r\nfrom the frontier garrisons. He proceeded to Chalchiuhcuecan or San\r\nJuan de Ulua, and thence followed the coast examining the inlets.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the frontier complaints became numerous against the native\r\ngarrisons by reason of raids and outrages, and supported by the chiefs\r\nwho attended him he reprimanded the commanders, threatening them\r\nwith the fate of Quauhpopoca unless they restrained the troops. They\r\nused to extend their raids into the Goazacoalco province, but were\r\nat present somewhat guarded, owing to a repulse wherein a number of\r\ncomrades had perished.[548]\r\n\r\nOrdaz’ proceedings served him well, for Tuchintlec, the cacique of\r\nthis province, sent a deputation of leading men to extend a welcome,\r\nand furnished canoes and men to aid in sounding the river. The bar\r\nwas found to be at least two fathoms and a half deep at low water,\r\nand above this, for twelve leagues, the soundings showed fully\r\nfive fathoms, with a prospect of an equal depth for some distance,\r\nwhereupon the pilots expressed the opinion that the channel might be\r\na strait leading to the southern sea.[549] Ordaz received not only\r\npresents of gold and pretty women for himself, but brought with him\r\nmessengers bearing jewels, tiger-skins, feathers, and precious stones\r\nfor Cortés, together with an offer of allegiance and tribute similar\r\nto those already tendered by the neighbors of Tabasco. His report,\r\nwhich extolled the agricultural resources as well as the port, induced\r\nthe general to send with the returning messengers another party to\r\nexamine these features more thoroughly and to test the disposition of\r\nthe inhabitants. They again sounded the river, selected a town site,\r\nand reported in favor of a settlement. The cacique also expressed\r\nhimself eager to receive settlers, and offered to begin at once the\r\nconstruction of houses. This decided Cortés to establish a colony on\r\nthe river, and in April Juan Velazquez and Rodrigo Rangel set out with\r\none hundred and fifty men to carry out the project. This, however,\r\nwas not destined to be so speedily accomplished.[550]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Villa Rica had been a source of no small anxiety to Cortés.\r\nHe had appointed Alonso de Grado to fill the vacant place of Escalante,\r\nas commander of the fortress, and as his lieutenant in the district.\r\nGrado was a man of agreeable presence and conversation, and with\r\nsome fame among his comrades as a writer and musician, but more of a\r\nbraggart than a soldier, with decided sympathies in favor of Velazquez.\r\nIndeed, Bernal Diaz charges him with having been the ringleader of the\r\nmutinous demonstration at Tlascala. Cortés was well acquainted with\r\nthe character of the man; but his glib tongue had evidently overcome\r\nthe prudence of the general, or else he preferred a less bold spirit\r\nthan Escalante’s at this post. “Now, Señor Grado,” said he in handing\r\nhim his commission, “here is the fulfilment of your long felt desire\r\nof going to Villa Rica. Take care of the fort, treat the Indians well,\r\nand do not undertake any expeditions like that of Escalante, or you\r\nmay meet his fate.” “In saying this,” adds Bernal Diaz, “he gave us\r\nsoldiers a wink, which we readily enjoyed, knowing well enough that\r\nGrado would not venture to do so, even under penalty of disgrace.”\r\nThe office of alguacil mayor, held by the former commander, was not\r\nincluded in the present commission, but was given to Sandoval, and\r\nwhen Grado remonstrated he was promised compensation in due time.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Villa Rica the evil nature of the man came to the front.\r\nHe assumed pompous demeanor, and expected the settlers to serve him\r\nas a great lord, while the Totonacs were pressed for gold and female\r\nslaves. The fort and the duties connected with it were neglected,\r\nand the commander spent his time in gormandizing and gambling, not\r\nto mention the secret efforts to undermine his general’s influence\r\nand to gain adherents for Velazquez. This soon reached the ears\r\nof Cortés, who felt not a little annoyed at having trusted such a\r\nfellow. He recognized the necessity of intrusting this district to\r\none thoroughly devoted to himself, since a fleet from Cuba might at\r\nany moment arrive and create mischief. Therefore he sent Sandoval,\r\nwho was brave and prudent, as well as loyal, and with him Pedro de\r\nIrcio, a former equerry, of insinuating manners and gossiping tongue,\r\nwhom Sandoval elevated to a commanding position.[551]\r\n\r\nGrado was immediately sent up to Mexico under a native guard, and\r\nwhen he arrived, with hands tied and a noose round his neck, the\r\nsoldiers derided him, while Cortés felt half inclined to hang the\r\nfellow. After a few days’ exposure in the stocks he was released, and\r\nsoon his smooth persuasion paved once more a way to the favor of his\r\ngeneral, with whom he became so reconciled as to obtain the office\r\nof contador not long afterward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the instructions to Sandoval was one to send to Mexico two\r\nshipwrights with ship-building implements, also chains, iron, sails,\r\nrope, compass, and everything needful to fit out four vessels which\r\nhad been placed on the stocks shortly after the seizure of the\r\nemperor.[552] The object was to afford a means for the ready movement\r\nof troops and for escape in case of an uprising, when the bridges would\r\ndoubtless be raised. In asking Montezuma for aid to fell and prepare\r\ntimber, it was pretended that it was for pleasure-boats wherewith\r\nto entertain him. Under the able direction of Martin Lopez aided by\r\nAlonso Nuñez, the master carpenters, they were completed within a\r\nfew weeks, and provided with four guns and tiers of oars, affording\r\ntransport for three hundred men.\r\n\r\nA hunting-trip to one of the imperial reserves across the lake was at\r\nonce arranged.[553] The largest vessel had been provided with awnings\r\nand other comforts for the reception of Montezuma, his suite, and\r\na strong guard, while other notables were accommodated in the other\r\ncraft. A volley from the guns announced their arrival, and did more\r\nprobably to inspire respect than even the presence of majesty. The\r\nvessels were accompanied by a fleet of canoes, some holding forty\r\nor more courtiers, hunters, or attendants. All were curious to see\r\nhow the winged water-houses would behave, for their immense size was\r\nsupposed to render them slow and clumsy. A fair breeze was blowing,\r\nhowever, and as the large sails unfurled, the vessels bounded forward\r\nwith a speed that in a few moments left the occupants of the canoes\r\nfar behind. Montezuma was delighted, and the trip was repeated.\r\nHunting parties were likewise formed; for the royal captive enjoyed\r\nthe chase and used the blow-pipe with great skill.[554]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [517] ‘Le dió en guarda á un capitan, é de noche é de dia\r\n     siempre estaban españoles en su presencia.’ _Tapia_, _Rel._,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 580. This captain appears\r\n     to have been Juan Velazquez, whose place was taken by Olid,\r\n     when required. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 77, 86.\r\n\r\n     [518] ‘Se quiso echar de vna açutea de diez estados en\r\n     alto, para que los suyos le recibiessen, sino le detuuiera\r\n     vn Castellano.... Denoche y de dia procurauan de sacarle,\r\n     oradando a cada passo las paredes, y echando fuego por las\r\n     azuteas.’\r\n\r\n     The result was an increase of the guard, Álvarez Chico being\r\n     placed with 60 men to watch the rear of the quarters, and\r\n     Andrés de Monjarraz the front, with the same number, each\r\n     watch consisting of twenty men. _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     viii. cap. iii. Bernal Diaz intimates that the guarding\r\n     of Montezuma proved a severe strain on the soldiers; but,\r\n     situated as they were, vigilance was ever required, and\r\n     still greater must have been the danger had he not been in\r\n     their power.\r\n\r\n     [519] Herrera calls him Peña, which may have been one of\r\n     his names, dec. ii. lib. viii. cap. v. Bernal Diaz assumes\r\n     that Montezuma asked Cortés to give him the page, after\r\n     the execution of Quauhpopoca. _Hist. Verdad._, 75.\r\n\r\n     [520] The bride was named Francisca. _Hist. Verdad._, 77.\r\n     As an instance of Montezuma’s eagerness to gratify the\r\n     Spaniards, and at the same time to exhibit his own power,\r\n     it is related that one day a hawk pursued a pigeon to the\r\n     very cot in the palace, amid the plaudits of the soldiers.\r\n     Among them was Francisco the dandy, former maestresala to\r\n     the admiral of Castile, who loudly expressed the wish to\r\n     obtain possession of the hawk and to tame him for falconry.\r\n     Montezuma heard him, and gave his hunters orders to catch\r\n     it, which they did. _Id._; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 125.\r\n\r\n     [521] Duran states that the soldiers discovered a house\r\n     filled with women, supposed to be wives of Montezuma, and\r\n     hidden to be out of the reach of the white men. He assumes\r\n     that gratitude would have made the Spaniards respect them;\r\n     or, if the women were nuns, that respect for virtue must\r\n     have obtained.\r\n\r\n     [522] Cortés’ protégée being named Ana. Quite a number of\r\n     the general’s followers declare in their testimony against\r\n     him, in 1528, that he assumed the intimate protectorship of\r\n     two or even three of Montezuma’s daughters, the second being\r\n     called Inés, or by others Isabel, the wife of Grado, and\r\n     afterward of Gallego. ‘Tres fijas de Montezuma e que las dos\r\n     dellas an parido del e la otra murio preñada del quando se\r\n     perdio esta cibdad.’ _Tirado_, in _Cortés_, _Residencia_,\r\n     ii. 39, 241, 244; i. 63, 99, 221, 263. Intrigues are\r\n     mentioned with other Indian princesses. Vetancurt assumes\r\n     that two noble maidens were given, one of whom Olid received.\r\n     _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 133; _Torquemada_, i. 462. Bernal\r\n     Diaz supposes that this is the first daughter offered by\r\n     Montezuma, and he believes evidently that Cortés accepts\r\n     her, to judge by a later reference. _Hist. Verdad._, 85, 102.\r\n\r\n     [523] Herrera states that Cortés’ order was prompted by\r\n     a consideration for the heavy expense to Montezuma. The\r\n     latter remonstrated at this economical fit, and commanded\r\n     that double rations should be provided for the exiled. dec.\r\n     ii. lib. viii. cap. iv.\r\n\r\n     [524] _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii.\r\n     580. ‘Purchè non tocchino disse il Re, le immagini degli\r\n     Dei, nè ciò che è destinato al loro culto, prendano quanto\r\n     vogliono,’ is Clavigero’s free interpretation of Ojeda’s\r\n     version. _Storia Mess._, iii. 97; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     125.\r\n\r\n     [525] ‘Lo q̄ vna vez daua no lo auia de tornar a recibir.’\r\n     ‘Las caxas donde la ropa estaua, eran tan grandes que\r\n     llegauan a las vigas de los aposentos, y tan anchas, q̄\r\n     despues de vacias, se alojauã en cada vna dos Castellanos.\r\n     Sacaron al patio mas de mil cargas de ropa.’ _Herrera_,\r\n     ii. viii. iv.\r\n\r\n     [526] ‘Casa de Cacao, de Motecuhçuma, adonde avia mas de\r\n     quarenta mil Cargas, que era Gran Riqueça, porque solia\r\n     valer cada Carga quarenta Castellanos.’ Alvarado alone\r\n     emptied six jars of 600 loads. _Torquemada_, i. 472.\r\n\r\n     [527] The man had insisted that Montezuma should have a\r\n     search made for two of his missing female attendants. The\r\n     emperor did not wish Spaniards punished for pilfering, as he\r\n     told Cortés, only for offering insult and violence. In such\r\n     cases he would have his own courtiers lashed. _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. viii. cap. v.\r\n\r\n     [528] ‘Tinie el marques tan recogida su gente, que ninguno\r\n     salie un tiro de arcabuz del aposento sin licencia, é\r\n     asimismo la gente tan en paz, que se averiguó nunca reñir\r\n     uno con otro.’ _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, ii. 586.\r\n\r\n     [529] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist Verdad._, 77. ‘Un giuoco, che\r\n     gli Spagnuoli chiamavano il _bodoque_.’ _Clavigero_, _Storia\r\n     Mess._, iii. 97. Bodoque signifies balls in this connection.\r\n     When Alvarado lost, he with great show of liberality paid\r\n     in chalchiuites, stones which were highly treasured by\r\n     the natives, but worth nothing to the Spaniards. Montezuma\r\n     paid in quoits, worth at least 50 ducats. One day he lost\r\n     40 or 50 quoits, and with pleasure, since it gave him the\r\n     opportunity to be generous. B. V. de Tapia testifies that\r\n     Alvarado used to cheat in playing cards with him and others.\r\n     _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. 51-2. Another way of gratifying\r\n     this bent was to accept trifles from the Spaniards and\r\n     liberally compensate them. Alonso de Ojeda, for instance,\r\n     had a silk-embroidered satchel with many pockets, for which\r\n     Montezuma gave him two pretty slaves, beside a number of\r\n     robes and jewels. Ojeda wrote a memoir on the conquest, of\r\n     which Herrera makes good use. dec. ii. lib. viii. cap. v.\r\n\r\n     [530] ‘Fué muchas veces á holgar con cinco ó seis españoles\r\n     á una y dos leguas fuera de la ciudad.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     92. Both the times and the number of the Spaniards are\r\n     doubtful, however. ‘Quando salia a caçar.... Lleuaua ocho o\r\n     diez Españoles en guarda de la persona, y tres mil Mexicanos\r\n     entre señores, caualleros, criados, y caçadores.’ _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 124; _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 297.\r\n\r\n     [531] Bernal Diaz intimates that more sacrifices were made\r\n     in their presence. ‘Y no podiamos en aquella sazon hazer\r\n     otra cosa sino dissimular con èl.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 78.\r\n\r\n     [532] Bernal Diaz admits that he knows not what occurred\r\n     between governor and monarch, but Herrera claims to be\r\n     better informed. Barefooted, and with eyes upon the floor,\r\n     Quauhpopoca approached the throne and said: ‘Most great\r\n     and most powerful lord, thy slave Quauhpopoca has come at\r\n     thy bidding, and awaits thy orders.’ He had done wrong,\r\n     was the reply, to kill the Spaniards, and then declare\r\n     that he had orders so to do. For this he should suffer as\r\n     a traitor to his sovereign and to the strangers. He was\r\n     not allowed to make any explanations, dec. ii. lib. viii.\r\n     cap. ix. It is not unlikely that Montezuma commanded him\r\n     not to reveal anything that might implicate his master,\r\n     hoping that Cortés would out of regard for his generous\r\n     host inflict a comparatively light punishment.\r\n\r\n     [533] ‘Examinaron los segunda vez, con mas rigor, y amenazas\r\n     de tormento, y sin discrepar todos confessaron,’ says\r\n     Herrera, loc. cit.\r\n\r\n     [534] ‘En vna de las casas reales dicha Tlacochalco.’\r\n     _Herrera_, loc. cit. ‘É serien mas que quinientas\r\n     carretadas.’ _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._,\r\n     ii. 584.\r\n\r\n     [535] ‘Me has negado no auer mãdado a Couatlpopocà q̄ matasse\r\n     a mis compañeros, no lo has hecho como tan gran señor que\r\n     eres, ... porque no quedes sin algun castigo, y tu y los\r\n     tuyos sepays quanto vale el tratar verdad, te mãdare echar\r\n     prisiones.’ Herrera implies with this that Cortés laid more\r\n     weight on the disregard for truth than on the authorization\r\n     of the outrage. dec. ii. lib. viii. cap. ix. ‘Que ya que\r\n     aquella culpa tuuiesse, que antes la pagaria el Cortès\r\n     por su persona, que versela passar al Monteçuma.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 75.\r\n\r\n     [536] ‘Esto hizo por ocuparle el pensamiento en sus duelos,\r\n     y dexasse los ajenos.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 129. ‘Todo\r\n     à fin de espantarle mas.’ _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._,\r\n     298.\r\n\r\n     [537] Solis seems to say that the bodies were burned after\r\n     execution, _Hist. Mex._, i. 461-2, but Cortés and others\r\n     are frank enough about the actual burning, which was not\r\n     regarded in that cruel age with the same aversion as by us.\r\n     Instances are to be found in the _Native Races_, ii.-iii.,\r\n     where this ordeal was undergone by criminals as well as\r\n     temple victims among the Aztecs. Bernal Diaz gives the names\r\n     of two of Quauhpopoca’s companions in misfortune, Quiabuitle\r\n     and Coatl. _Hist. Verdad._, 75. Prescott, _Mex._, ii. 173,\r\n     states that the execution took place in the court-yard;\r\n     but this is probably a misprint, to judge by his own text.\r\n\r\n     [538] ‘Á lo que entendimos, ê lo mas cierto, Cortés auia\r\n     dicho á Aguilar la lengua, que le dixesse de secreto, que\r\n     aunque Malinche le mandasse salir de la prision, que los\r\n     Capitanes nuestros, è soldados no querriamos.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 75.\r\n\r\n     [539] ‘Fué tanto el buen tratamiento que yo le hice, y el\r\n     contentamiento que de mí tenia, que algunas veces y muchas\r\n     le acometi con su libertad, rogándole que fuese á su casa,\r\n     y me dijo todas las veces que se lo decia, que él estaba\r\n     bien allí,’ etc. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 91. ‘No osaua, de\r\n     miedo que los suyos no le matassen ... por auerse dexado\r\n     prender,’ is one of the suppositions of Gomara, who calls\r\n     him a man of little heart. _Hist. Mex._, 129-30. Peter\r\n     Martyr appears to be moved rather by pity for him. dec.\r\n     v. cap. iii. ‘Non gli conveniva ritornare al suo palagio,\r\n     mentre fossero nella Corte gli Spagnuoli.’ _Clavigero_,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 102.\r\n\r\n     [540] ‘Como este castigo se supo en todas las Prouincias\r\n     de la Nueua-España, temieron, y los pueblos de la costa,\r\n     adonde mataron nuestros soldados, bolvieron á servir.’\r\n     Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 75-6, comments upon the\r\n     daring of the Spaniards in carrying out these and similar\r\n     high-handed acts. For a short time after this, says Herrera,\r\n     the soldiers were ordered to sleep on their arms, in case\r\n     of any demonstration. dec. ii. lib. viii. cap. ix. Clavigero\r\n     regards the burning as unjustifiable, since the emperor was\r\n     regarded as having authorized it. If he was not guilty,\r\n     the Spaniards were ungrateful to treat him as they did.\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 101. Robertson finds some excuse for\r\n     Quauhpopoca’s punishment, but calls the humiliation of\r\n     Montezuma a wanton display of power. _Hist. Am._, ii. 63,\r\n     453-4. Prescott, on the other hand, regards the humiliation\r\n     as politic, on the ground that by rendering the monarch\r\n     contemptible in the eyes of his subjects, he was obliged\r\n     to rely more on the Spaniards. _Mex._, ii. 177. But this\r\n     would hardly have been necessary since he was in their\r\n     power, and considering that the object of keeping him so\r\n     was to control the country, it would have been better not\r\n     to degrade him.\r\n\r\n     [541] ‘Donde mas oro se solia traer, que era de vna Provincia\r\n     que se dize, Zacatula ... de otra Provincia, que se dize\r\n     Gustepeque, cerca de donde desembarcamos ... é que cerca\r\n     de aquella Provincia ay otras buenas minas, en parte que\r\n     no son sujetos, que se dizen, los Chinatecas, y Capotecas.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 81. Montezuma detailed two\r\n     persons for each of four provinces where gold was to be\r\n     had, and Cortés gave two Spaniards for each couple. The\r\n     provinces named were Cuzula, Tamazulapa, Malinaltepeque,\r\n     Tenis. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 92-3. Of the eight Indians, four\r\n     were miners or goldsmiths, and the others guides. _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 130. Chimalpain names the provinces: Tamazólan,\r\n     in upper Miztecapan, Malinaltepec and Tenich, both on the\r\n     same river, and Tututepec, twelve leagues farther, in the\r\n     Xicayan country. _Hist. Conq._, i. 254-5.\r\n\r\n     [542] ‘Con tal, que los de Culùa no entrassen en su tierra.’\r\n     They were reassured and dismissed with presents. _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. ix. cap. i.\r\n\r\n     [543] ‘Cortés se holgô tanto con el oro como si fueran\r\n     treinta mil pesos, en saber cierto que avia buenas minas.’\r\n     Bernal Diaz intimates beside that Umbría and his two\r\n     companions had provided themselves with plenty of gold.\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 81-2.\r\n\r\n     [544] A young man of 25 years, whom Cortés treated as\r\n     a relative. With him went four Spaniards who understood\r\n     mining, and four chiefs. _Id._\r\n\r\n     [545] ‘En granos crespillos, porque dixeron los mineros,\r\n     que aquello era de mas duraderas minas como de nacimiento.’\r\n     _Id._, 82.\r\n\r\n     [546] Bernal Diaz names them, ‘Barriẽtos, y Heredia el\r\n     viejo, y Escalona el moço, y Cervantes el chocarrero,’ and\r\n     says that Cortés, displeased at soldiers being left to raise\r\n     fowl and cacao, sent Alonso Luis to recall them. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 82; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. ix. cap. i. He is\r\n     evidently mistaken, as shown by his own later text, for\r\n     Cortés himself states that he sought to form plantations\r\n     in that direction. The recall was made later and for a\r\n     different reason.\r\n\r\n     [547] ‘Estaban sembradas sesenta hanegas de maíz y diez\r\n     de frijoles, y dos mil piés de cacap [cacao] ... hicieron\r\n     un estanque de agua, y en él pusieron quinientos patos\r\n     ... y pusieron hasta mil y quinientas gallinas.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 94; _Peter Martyr_, dec. v. cap. iii. Oviedo writes\r\n     that farms were established for the king in two or three\r\n     provinces, one in Chimanta [Chimantla]. The two Spaniards\r\n     left in the latter were saved, but elsewhere, subject to the\r\n     Aztecs, they were killed during the uprising originated by\r\n     Alvarado. iii. 376. Tapia refers to an expedition at this\r\n     time against a revolted province, 80 leagues off. _Rel._,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 584.\r\n\r\n     [548] ‘Por aquella causa llaman oy en dia, donde aquella\r\n     guerra passò, Cuilonemiqui.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     82.\r\n\r\n     [549] _Herrera_, loc. cit. ‘Creyan lo que desseauan,’\r\n     remarks Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 131.\r\n\r\n     [550] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 95, 116; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     131-2. Bernal Diaz throws doubt on the expedition of\r\n     Velazquez, but is evidently forgetful. _Hist. Verdad._, 81-2.\r\n     ‘El señor de la provinçia ... luego hiço seys [casas] en el\r\n     assiento é parte que para el pueblo se señaló.’ _Oviedo_,\r\n     iii. 293. Peter Martyr calls these buildings ‘Tributaries’\r\n     houses.’ dec. v. cap. iii.; _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 6,\r\n     49.\r\n\r\n     [551] He had served as equerry in the noble houses of the\r\n     Conde de Ureña and Pedro Giron, of whose affairs he was\r\n     always prating. His propensity for tale-telling lost him\r\n     many friends, but he managed to keep intimate with Sandoval,\r\n     whose favors he afterward repaid with ingratitude. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 76, 246. Gomara insists on naming him\r\n     as the comandante, but this dignity he attained only after\r\n     Sandoval and Rangel had held it. _Cortés_, _Residencia_,\r\n     i. 256; _Torquemada_, i. 456.\r\n\r\n     [552] ‘Luego que entré en la dicha ciudad di mucha priesa\r\n     á facer cuatro bergantines ... tales que podian echar\r\n     trecientos hombres en la tierra y llevar los caballos.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 103; _Peter Martyr_, dec. v. cap.\r\n     iv. ‘Quatro fustas.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 146. ‘Dos\r\n     vergantines.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 76. The cedars\r\n     of Tacuba, numerous enough at this period, yielded much\r\n     of the timber, and the slopes of Iztaccihuatl and Telapon\r\n     the harder portion for masts, keels, etc. _Mora_, in _Soc.\r\n     Mex.

The Mexicans were not\r\nslow to mark this, and there were those among them, and others beside\r\nthem, who began to think of taking matters into their own hands, of\r\ndestroying the invaders and releasing the emperor.\r\n\r\nMontezuma’s occasional appearance in public, and the assertion that\r\nhe remained with the Spaniards of his free-will, and because the gods\r\ndesired it, had for a time satisfied the nobles; but the hard irons\r\non his limbs and the cruel burning of patriotic men had opened their\r\neyes somewhat to the true state of affairs. No one knew when his turn\r\nmight come. Life was insecure enough subject to the caprice of their\r\nown sovereign, but the dark uncertain ways of these emissaries of\r\nevil were past finding out. These things were thought of and talked\r\nof in high places. Race aversions and the political systems of the\r\ntripartite alliance caused more than one party to be formed, each with\r\naspirations that could not be entertained by the others. The most\r\nprominent leader at this time was Cacama, who had at first favored\r\nthe strangers in their character as envoys. And now he began the\r\nendeavor to direct the movement of the Aztec nobility, but jealousy\r\nof Acolhua influence rose uppermost, and his efforts tended only to\r\ncreate a reaction in favor of abiding by the will of the emperor.[555]\r\n\r\nAlthough there were enough of sympathizers in Mexico for his purpose,\r\nCacama found that he must rely almost wholly on the northern provinces,\r\nand in connection with Cuitlahuatzin, Totoquihuatzin II. of Tlacopan,\r\nhis own brothers, and others, he organized a conspiracy which had for\r\nits aim the expulsion of the Spaniards and the release of his uncle.\r\nBeneath this was harbored a design upon the Aztec throne, which would\r\nprobably become vacant; and even if Cacama was not sure of gaining\r\nthis for himself, he had at least the expectation of assuming the\r\nleadership of the Anáhuac confederacy.[556] He presented to the council\r\nin the most dismal aspect the purposes of the Spaniards, who evidently\r\nsought to become absolute masters and reduce them all to slavery. It\r\nwas time to rise for religion and liberty. Their honor and welfare\r\ndemanded it, and this before the Spaniards rendered themselves too\r\npowerful by reinforcements and alliances. With heedless confidence\r\nhe vaunted that Mexico should be his within a few hours after setting\r\nout against her, for there were many of her citizens ready to aid in\r\nsuch a work. The Spaniards were overrated, and could effect little,\r\nsurrounded as they were on all sides, and without other supplies than\r\nthose provided by the Mexicans.\r\n\r\nThe motives and the necessity were recognized, though the means\r\nproposed met with some objections; but when the question of spoils\r\nand rewards came forward there were still greater differences.\r\nAmong others, the brave and powerful lord of Matlaltzinco advanced\r\npretensions, founded in part on his close relationship to Montezuma,\r\nwhich Cacama above all could not admit. The result was disagreement,\r\nfollowed by the withdrawal of several members.[557]\r\n\r\nNo attempt had been made to keep the movement, or its ostensible\r\nmotive, a secret from Montezuma, nor could it have been kept from him\r\nwho was the still powerful ruler of a servile race; but, even if the\r\ndeeper lying aim was not revealed him, he could not fail to foresee\r\nthe troubles that might arise, particularly under such a leader.\r\nHe still hoped the Spaniards would soon leave, or that his release\r\nmight be effected by other means, for he dreaded a conflict with the\r\npowerful invaders, involving perhaps the destruction of the city and\r\nhis own death. He sent to tell the conspirators that they need not\r\nconcern themselves about his imprisonment. The Spaniards had more\r\nthan once proposed that he should return to his own palace, but the\r\ngods had decreed it otherwise. He could not allow his people to be\r\nneedlessly exposed to war, or his capital to destruction. Remember\r\nCholula. Their stay would not be long.\r\n\r\nThis message was not without its effect even among the Tezcucans, for,\r\nalthough the fate of the Aztec capital and king may have concerned them\r\nbut little, there were many who could not forget that the impetuous\r\nand proud Cacama had obtained the throne by favor of Montezuma, to the\r\nprejudice of an elder brother, Tetlahuehuetquizitzin.Their father,\r\nNezahualpilli, had died in 1515, without naming a successor, and\r\nthe choice devolving on the royal council, in conjunction with the\r\nrulers of Mexico and Tlacopan, Cacama was elected. Cohuanacoch, the\r\nthird brother, acquiesced, but the youngest, the fiery Ixtlilxochitl,\r\nprotested in favor of the eldest heir, and denounced the selection\r\nas due to Montezuma, who hoped to mould the new king to his own will\r\nand so again to control. He even resorted to arms in support of his\r\nviews, and enlisting the northern provinces in his favor, after a\r\nshort campaign he obliged Cacama to consent to a division of the\r\nkingdom with himself.[558]\r\n\r\nHis ready success proved that Cacama had no very great hold on the\r\npeople, and now, when came the warning of Montezuma, more than one\r\nchief counselled prudence from other motives than fear. But the king\r\nstamped all these objections as cowardly, and appears even to have\r\nplaced under restraint several of those whose want of sympathy he\r\nhad reason to suspect.[559] His blood was hot, and relying on the\r\npromises of his supporters, he considered himself strong enough to bid\r\ndefiance to his opponents. He sent word to his uncle that if he had\r\nany regard for the dignity of his station and the honor of his person\r\nand ancestry, he would not quietly submit to the bondage imposed by\r\na handful of robbers, who with smooth tongue sought to cover their\r\noutrages against him and the gods. If he refused to rise in defence\r\nof his religion, throne, and liberty, Cacama would not.[560]\r\n\r\nThis outspoken utterance of the nephew whom he had assisted to\r\nrulership amazed Montezuma as much as it wounded his pride, and he no\r\nlonger hesitated to take counsel with Cortés, who had already obtained\r\nan inkling that something was stirring.[561] With characteristic\r\npromptness the latter suggested that, since Cacama’s real object\r\nwas evidently to usurp the throne, a Mexican army should be given to\r\naid the Spaniards in laying waste the territory of the conspirators\r\nand in capturing them. The emperor had probably entertained a hope\r\nthat the news would frighten his guest and make it safe to urge a\r\nretreat from Mexico, thus ending the whole trouble. He was therefore\r\nsomewhat startled by this proposal, the true tenor of which he well\r\nunderstood. He feared a fratricidal war of doubtful result, wherein\r\nhe would appear as arrayed against the defenders of national religion\r\nand liberty; and being now weak and cowed he hesitated to arm at all,\r\npreferring peaceful measures. To this Cortés was not averse, for he\r\nrecognized on second thought that aggressive steps might become the\r\nsignal for a general uprising which would overwhelm him, since Aztec\r\ntroops could never be relied on.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly sent messages to Cacama, reminding him of their friendly\r\nintercourse, and representing the danger of offending the Spanish\r\nking by proceedings which could only react on himself and lead to\r\nthe destruction of his kingdom. Montezuma supported this by asking\r\nthe king to come to Mexico and arrange the difficulty. Cacama had\r\nnot gone so far to be restrained by what he termed an empty threat,\r\nand regardless of the warnings from a timid minority he replied that\r\nhe knew not the king of the Spaniards, and would never accept the\r\nfriendship of men who had oppressed his country and outraged his blood\r\nand religion. He had had enough of their promises, but would declare\r\nhis determination when he saw them.[562] To Montezuma he sent word\r\nthat he would come, “not with the hand on the heart, however, but on\r\nthe sword.”[563]\r\n\r\nThere was considerable meaning in this threat, for Cacama had with\r\ngreat energy set about to mass his forces at Oztoticpac, and they in\r\nconjunction with those of his allies would make a formidable host.[564]\r\nCortés was aware of this, and seeing that no time was to be lost he\r\nfirmly represented to Montezuma the necessity of securing the person\r\nof the king, openly or by stealth; and when he still hesitated, the\r\nsignificant hint was given that the Spaniards would regard a refusal\r\nwith suspicion. This decided him, and he promised that it should be\r\ndone, if possible. Cortés broke forth in expressions of good-will,\r\nand again offered him that freedom which Montezuma well knew he would\r\nnever grant.\r\n\r\nIn placing Cacama on the throne, the emperor had seized the opportunity\r\nto introduce into the Acolhua government offices several creatures of\r\nhis own, who were paid to maintain Aztec influence in the council[565]\r\nand to watch operations. To these men he sent an order, weighted\r\nwith presents, to seize the king and bring him to Mexico.[566] They\r\naccordingly prevailed on their victim to hold a council at Tepetzinco\r\nfor finally arranging the campaign. This palace was situated on the\r\nlake, near Tezcuco, and approached by canals. Here Cacama was seized\r\nand thrown into a boat prepared for the occasion, and carried to the\r\nAztec capital.[567]\r\n\r\nAshamed, perhaps, of his share in the transaction, and unwilling to\r\nface the taunts of the captive, Montezuma refused to see him, and\r\nhe was surrendered to Cortés, who, regardless of royalty, applied\r\nthe fetters as the surest means against escape.[568] This seizure\r\nscattered the conspirators and their schemes to the winds, and the\r\ndemoralization was completed by the arrest of several of the more\r\nimportant personages, such as the king of Tlacopan and the lords of\r\nIztapalapan and Coyuhuacan, who were also shackled.[569] Thus we see\r\nthat Montezuma’s captivity did not greatly affect his power, since\r\nhe could so readily place under restraint the confederate kings, in\r\ntheir own provinces; and it was not wholly unwelcome to him to find\r\nhis misfortune shared by other prominent men, since this made his\r\ndisgrace less conspicuous.\r\n\r\nHe now resolved, with the approval of Cortés, to depose the Tezcucan\r\nruler, as a rebel against his authority, and to place on the throne\r\na more dutiful subject, a younger natural brother of Cacama, named\r\nCuicuetzcatl,[570] whom his ill-treatment had driven to Mexico for\r\nprotection. The nomination was for the sake of appearance submitted\r\nfor ratification to a convention of loyal Tezcucan chiefs, many of\r\nwhom hoped no doubt to obtain greater influence under this youth. The\r\nnew king was escorted to the gates of Mexico by Cortés and Montezuma,\r\nand received at Tezcuco with triumphal arches and processions.[571]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now, with the three confederate rulers and a number of leading\r\ncaciques in his power, the great king-maker thought the time had come\r\nto exact a formal acknowledgment of Spanish sovereignty. He reminded\r\nMontezuma of his promises to pay tribute, and demanded that he and his\r\nvassals should tender allegiance. Instead of the objections expected,\r\nCortés was surprised to hear a prompt acquiescence. Montezuma had\r\nevidently been long prepared for the demand, and said that he would\r\nat once convene his chiefs for consultation. Within little more than a\r\nweek the summoned dignitaries had arrived, and at a meeting, attended\r\nby no Spaniards save the page, he intimated to the leading personages,\r\nso far as he dared before this witness, that the concession demanded\r\nof them was to satisfy the importunate jailers. “The gods, alas! are\r\nmute,” concluded Montezuma; “but by and by they may signify their will\r\nmore clearly, and I will then say what further is to be done.”[572]\r\nAll declared sorrowfully that they would do as he bade, and Cortés\r\nwas informed that on the following day the required ceremony would\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the chiefs mustered in force before Montezuma, who\r\nwas seated on a throne having on either side the new king of Tezcuco\r\nand he of Tlacopan.[573] All being prepared, the Spanish general\r\nentered with his captains and a number of soldiers. The emperor\r\nnow addressed his vassals, reminding them of the relation so long\r\nand happily maintained between them—as dutiful subjects on the one\r\nside, and a line of loving monarchs on the other. Comparing the\r\nQuetzalcoatl myth and other indications with the advent of white men\r\nfrom the region of the rising sun, he showed that they must be the\r\nlong expected race, sent to claim allegiance for their king, to whom\r\nthe sovereignty evidently belonged. The gods had willed it that their\r\ngeneration should repair the omission of their ancestors. “Hence I\r\npray that as you have hitherto held and obeyed me as your lord, so\r\nyou will henceforth hold and obey this great king, for he is your\r\nlegitimate ruler, and in his place accept this captain of his. All the\r\ntribute and service hitherto tendered me give to him, for I also have\r\nto contribute and serve with all that he may require. In doing this\r\nyou will fulfil not only your duty, but give me great pleasure.”[574]\r\n\r\nHis concluding words were almost lost in the sobs which his humiliated\r\nsoul could no longer stifle. The chiefs were equally affected, and\r\nthe sympathies even of the flint-hearted Spaniards were aroused to a\r\ndegree which moistened many an eye. With some of the lately arrived\r\ndignitaries, who had not had time to fully grasp the situation at the\r\ncapital, indignation struggled with grief at the dismal prospect.\r\nOthers recalled the prophecy that the empire would terminate with\r\nMontezuma, whose very name appeared fraught with evil omen,[575] and\r\nwere quite reconciled to the inevitable. So were most of them, for\r\nthat matter, either through belief in the myth or from a sense of\r\nduty to their master. One of the eldest nobles broke the oppressive\r\nsilence by declaring his sorrow at witnessing the grief of their\r\nbeloved sovereign and hearing the announcement of coming changes.\r\nBut since the time had come for the fulfilment of divine decrees,\r\nthey, as devout and dutiful subjects, could only submit. Again their\r\ngrief broke forth, though many a bitter glance was called up by the\r\nallusion to changes in store for them. Observing the bad impression,\r\nCortés hastened to assure them that Montezuma would not only remain\r\nthe great emperor he had always been, and his vassals be confirmed\r\nin their dignities and possessions, but that their domain and power\r\nwould be increased. The changes proposed were merely intended to\r\nstop wars, to enlighten them on matters with which they were as yet\r\nunacquainted, and to promote general welfare. One after another,\r\nbeginning with Montezuma, they now swore allegiance, and gave promise\r\nof service and tribute, after which they were dismissed with thanks\r\nfor their compliance.[576]\r\n\r\nThe submission of the sovereigns appears to have been quietly accepted\r\nthroughout the country, and the impunity with which even single\r\nSpaniards moved about shows that no hostility had been aroused by\r\nthe act, in the provinces at least. Evidently the people hovered\r\nbetween fear of men who so few in number could yet perform so great\r\nachievements, and awe of divine will as indicated by the prophecies\r\nand traditions. Cortés was not slow in making use of his new power by\r\nrepresenting to the emperor that, his king being in need of gold for\r\ncertain projects, it would be well for the new vassals to begin tribute\r\npayments as an earnest of their loyalty. Montezuma had expected this,\r\nand it was readily agreed that he should send officers, accompanied\r\nby Spaniards, to the different provinces and towns of the empire for\r\ncontributions.[577] These demands were met with more or less alacrity,\r\nand in poured gold and silver, in dust, and quoits, and leaves, and\r\ntrinkets, which formed to a certain extent a medium for trade. Many\r\ntowns remote from the mines had nothing to offer save a few jewels,\r\nwhich were perhaps heirlooms among the chiefs.[578]\r\n\r\nWhen the collectors returned, Montezuma summoned the Spanish leaders,\r\nand surrendered what they had brought. In addition to this, he\r\noffered them the treasures kept in his own palace, regretting that\r\nhe had not more to give; but previous offerings had diminished what\r\nhe possessed. “When you transmit it to your king,” he said, “tell\r\nhim that it comes from his good vassal, Montezuma.” He requested that\r\ncertain fine chalchiuite stones, each valued at two loads of gold, and\r\nsome finely chased and inlaid blow-pipes, should be given to the king\r\nalone.[579] This liberality evoked the most profound protestations of\r\ngratitude, as may be supposed, for they had not expected so great an\r\naddition to the glittering heaps already in their possession. Tapia\r\nand another officer were despatched in all haste with the imperial\r\nmayordomo to receive the treasure. It was stored in a hall and two\r\nsmaller chambers of the aviary building,[580] and consisted of gold,\r\nsilver, and precious stones, in setting and in separate form, with\r\nfeathers, robes, and other articles, all of which were transferred\r\nto the Spanish quarters.[581]\r\n\r\nThese valuables, together with the collections from the provinces\r\nand the previously surrendered treasures of Axayacatl, were given to\r\nCortés, who placed them in charge of the treasurer, Gonzalo Mejía,\r\nand the contador, Alonso de Ávila. The famed smiths of Azcapuzalco\r\nwere called in to separate the gold and silver settings from the\r\njewels of less delicacy and beauty, which it had been determined to\r\nmelt. This took about three days. They were then melted into bars,\r\nthree fingers in breadth, and stamped with the royal arms.[582] Iron\r\nweights were made of one arroba and downward, not very exact, it seems,\r\nyet suitable for the purpose, and with these the value of the melted\r\ngold was found to be somewhat over 162,000 pesos de oro, according\r\nto Cortés’ statement; the silver weighed over 500 marcos, and the\r\nunbroken jewels and other effects were estimated at over 500,000\r\nducats, not counting the workmanship.[583] The jewels were set with\r\nfeathers, pearls, and precious stones, fashioned chiefly in animal\r\nforms, “so perfect as to appear natural.” A number of trinkets for the\r\nroyal share had also been fashioned by the goldsmiths after designs\r\nby the Spaniards, such as saintly images, crucifixes, bracelets, and\r\nchains, all made with wonderful fidelity to originals. The silver for\r\nthe same share was made into plates, spoons, and similar articles. The\r\nfeathers presented a brilliant variety of colors and forms, and the\r\ncotton, some of the most delicate texture and color, was both plain\r\nand embroidered, and made into robes, tapestry, covers, and other\r\narticles. Turquoises, pearls, toys, and trinkets were also among the\r\ntreasures.[584]\r\n\r\nCortés proposed to defer the distribution till more gold and better\r\nweights were obtained; but the men, who with good reason, perhaps,\r\nsuspected that a delay might diminish rather than increase the\r\ntreasures, clamored for an immediate division. The troops were\r\naccordingly called, and in their presence the partition was made:\r\nfirst of the royal fifth;[585] then of the fifth promised to Cortés\r\nwhen appointed captain-general; after this a large sum was set apart\r\nto cover expenditures by Cortés and Velazquez on the fleet and its\r\noutfit, and the value of the horses killed during the campaign,[586]\r\nand another sum for the expenses and shares of the procuradores in\r\nSpain, while double or special shares were assigned to the priests,\r\nthe captains, those owning horses, and the men with fire-arms and\r\ncross-bows.[587] After all these deductions but little remained for\r\nthe rank and file—a hundred pesos, if we may credit Bernal Diaz.[588]\r\nThis, many indignantly refused to accept; others took it, but joined\r\nin the clamors of the discontented.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is almost too much to ask of vultures not to quarrel over their\r\nprey. The murmur against the royal fifth was loud enough, but the\r\nsecond fifth for Cortés raised quite an outcry. “Are we to have a\r\nsecond king?” they asked. Others inquired, “For whose fleet are we\r\npaying?” They further wished to know whether the fame and promotion\r\nacquired for the general by his men could not satisfy some of his\r\nclaims, for the present, at least. They had once before surrendered\r\nhard-earned money to please him and to promote his credit with the\r\nking, and now, when they had been led to expect reward, it was again\r\nsnatched from them. Some said that a large proportion of the treasures\r\nhad been secured by Cortés and his favorites before the distribution\r\nbegan; and the value of the heavy gold chains and other ornaments\r\ndisplayed by them was significantly pointed at as out of proportion\r\nto their share.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion was confirmed by a quarrel which occurred shortly after\r\nbetween Velazquez de Leon and Treasurer Mejía respecting the payment\r\nof the royal fifth on certain unbroken jewels found in Velazquez’\r\npossession, and received by him before the apportionment. It was\r\nenough, said Mejía, for Cortés to appropriate unassessed treasures.\r\nVelazquez refusing to comply, they came to blows, and if friends\r\nhad not interfered there might have been an officer or two less in\r\nthe camp. As it was, both received slight wounds, and subsequently\r\nshackles. Mejía was released within a few hours; but his antagonist\r\nretained the fetters for two days, persuaded to submit with grace\r\nthereto by Cortés, it was said, in order to allay suspicions and\r\nto show that the general could be just, even when it affected a\r\nfriend.[589]\r\n\r\nFinding that the murmurs were becoming serious, Cortés brought his\r\nsoothing eloquence to bear upon the troubled spirits. He represented\r\nthat all his thoughts, efforts, and possessions were for the honor of\r\nhis God, his king, and his companions. With them he had shared every\r\ndanger and hardship, and for their welfare he had watched, rendering\r\njustice to all. The division had been fairly made in accordance with\r\nprevious arrangement. But he was not avaricious; all he had was theirs,\r\nand he would employ it for them as might a father. He would surrender\r\nthe fifth which had been assigned him, if they wished it, retaining\r\nonly his share as captain-general; and he would also help any one\r\nin need. The treasure thus far secured was insignificant compared\r\nto what lay before them. What mattered a few hundred pesos more or\r\nless in view of the rich mines, the large tracts, and the immense\r\nnumber of towns, which were all theirs, so long as they held loyally\r\ntogether? “I will make a lord of every one of you,” he concluded,\r\n“if you will but have peace and patience.”[590] And to give greater\r\neffect to this harangue he bribed with gifts and promises the more\r\ninfluential to sound his praises; whereupon the murmurs died away,\r\nthough rancor still remained with many, awaiting opportunity.[591]\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the soldiers imitated the example of the heavy\r\nsharers in the spoils by converting their allotment, with the aid of\r\nAzcapuzalcan goldsmiths, into chains, crosses, and other adornments for\r\ntheir persons, so that the display of wealth became quite dazzling.\r\nOthers yielded to the infatuation for gambling, then so prevalent,\r\nand lost without a murmur the hard-earned share.[592]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut one thing now remained to complete the triumph of the conqueror.\r\nThe manacled kings were subservient, and the people displayed their\r\nloyalty by pouring tribute into his coffers. But his god was not\r\ntheirs, and this the pious pilferer could not endure. He and his\r\npriests had lost no opportunity to preach the faith to emperor and\r\nsubjects;[593] but the hearts of the natives were obdurately fixed on\r\nthe idols of the pyramid. He never beheld the temple without being\r\ntempted to lay low the effigies of Satan, and it was owing only to\r\nFather Olmedo’s prudent counsel that the temptation was resisted.\r\nRepeatedly had he urged on the weak emperor to begin the great work\r\nby some radical reform, but could obtain only the promise that human\r\nsacrifices would be stopped. Finding that even this was not observed,\r\nhe consulted with his captains, and it was agreed to demand the\r\nsurrender of the great temple for Christian worship, so that the\r\nnatives might be made to feel the holy influence of its symbols and\r\nrites. Montezuma was prepared with excuses, but the deputation declared\r\nwith fierce vehemence that if this were refused they would forcibly\r\nremove the idols and kill the priests who resisted. “Malinche,”\r\nexclaimed the monarch in alarm, “do you then seek the destruction of\r\nthe city? Our gods are incensed against us, and the people imbittered.\r\nEven your lives will not be safe. Wait, I entreat you, till I call\r\nthe priests for consultation.”[594]\r\n\r\nCortés saw that nothing more could then be attained, but with the\r\nindiscreet zeal for religion which often blinded him he determined\r\nthat there should be no further delay. He apprehended no uprising\r\namong a people which had so patiently submitted to all exactions, yet\r\nhe feared that the priests, if warned, might prevent an entry into\r\nthe temple, and so he resolved to anticipate them, and to demonstrate\r\nthe impotency of their gods. Giving orders for a strong force to\r\nfollow after a short interval, he went forward with hardly a dozen\r\nmen in order not to arouse suspicion.[595] Entering the sanctuary,\r\nand finding that he could not draw aside the costly curtain with\r\nits golden pellet fringe which shielded the bejewelled idols from\r\nprofane gaze, he had it cut asunder. The reason for the obstruction\r\nnow became apparent. The idol showed traces of fresh human blood. At\r\nthis evidence of broken promises and disregarded orders Cortés began\r\nto rave. “Oh God!” he cried, “why dost thou permit the devil to be\r\nthus honored in this land? Let it appear good that we serve thee.”\r\n\r\nTurning to the temple attendants, who had followed with apprehensive\r\nmien, he upbraided them for their blind adherence to a bloody\r\nworship, and compared the evil of idolatry with the saving rites\r\nof Christianity. He was determined, he said, to remove the idols\r\nand install an image of the virgin. They must take away all within\r\nthe sanctuary and cleanse it. The priests shook their heads at such\r\nan insane idea. All the city and country around adored these gods,\r\nand they would die rather than see them desecrated. They further\r\nintimated that the deities would themselves know how to chastise the\r\nsacrilegious. This reply only fired the fury of Cortés, and unable\r\nfurther to restrain himself, he seized a bar, dashed at the idol,\r\nand striking it a blow which caused the golden mask to fall off, he\r\nexclaimed, “Shall we not do something for God?” Captain Andrés de\r\nTapia, one of the dozen Spaniards present on the occasion, testifies\r\nto the rash proceeding: “I swear by my faith as a gentleman and by\r\nGod that it is true. It seems as if I now see the marquis springing\r\nwith excitement and striking at the idol.”[596]\r\n\r\nWhen the real intentions of Cortés had first become apparent to the\r\npriests, they sent to warn Montezuma, as emperor and high-priest,\r\nthat some outrage might be perpetrated. Suspecting that the recent\r\nthreat was about to be carried out, he despatched a messenger to the\r\ngeneral asking permission to come to the temple, and imploring him\r\nmeanwhile to respect the idols. The message arrived before much damage\r\nwas done, and with the advice of his followers Cortés was induced\r\nto yield. He recognized that the attitude assumed might lead to more\r\nserious results than had been at first supposed. The rumor had spread\r\nof extraordinary proceedings on the temple summit, and armed and\r\nthreatening crowds were gathering at the foot, impeded only by the\r\nSpanish reserve escort[597] from ascending to defend their gods. Why\r\nshould not they fight for their religion as well as others? Seeing that\r\nthe emperors presence was necessary to calm them, Cortés permitted\r\nhim to come. He soon arrived, under a strong guard, and pointing to\r\nthe excited masses he reasoned with Cortés upon the uselessness and\r\ndanger of his hasty project. The latter stubbornly insisted, and\r\nafter a consultation with the priests it was agreed to surrender both\r\nthe summit chapels of Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatlipoca to Christian\r\nworship,[598] on condition that the idols within might be removed\r\nby the reverent hands of priests alone. This was effected while the\r\nemperor remained on the summit. The chapels were then whitewashed,\r\na cross was planted, and two altars rose, on which were placed the\r\nimage of the virgin and of a saint whom Tapia calls San Cristóbal.[599]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPreparations were next made to consecrate the sanctuary, now festive\r\nwith garlands and flowers. The Spaniards marched in procession through\r\nthe streets, to the chant of psalms, headed by the two priests who\r\nbore the crucifix and images. Crowds of wondering natives lined\r\ntheir path, and remained to watch the cross winding its way round\r\nthe pyramid in a sanctifying orbit. Cortés was the first to kiss the\r\ninstalled crucifix, while tears of joy rolled down his cheeks. Mass\r\nfollowed the consecration, and with a swelling Te Deum the soldiers\r\nrendered thanks to the supreme being for the triumph accorded them\r\nover paganism.\r\n\r\nIt was but a partial victory, however, for in the court the priests\r\nwere even then gathered in adoration of the chief idol, bewailing\r\ntheir own impotency, and imploring it to rise and avenge its outraged\r\nmajesty and their humiliation. An old soldier was left as guard\r\nto keep the candles burning, and to prevent intrusion from, temple\r\nattendants, save to clean the place for the frequent services which\r\nwere henceforth held here.[600]\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the step thus gained, the priests and their\r\nfollowers sought to impress upon the natives the superiority of\r\ntheir faith,[601] and numbers were convinced, says Tapia, although\r\nfew accepted baptism out of fear of their countrymen.[602] There was\r\na drought prevailing at the time, and the priests, having in vain\r\nappealed for a remedy, ascribed the evil to the anger of the gods at\r\nthe presence of the worshippers of strange deities and their hateful\r\nsymbols. A few days after the consecration of the altars a deputation\r\nof natives appeared at the Spanish quarters, bearing withered\r\ncorn-stalks, and demanding that, since the Europeans had removed\r\nthe idols to whom they prayed for rain, they should ask their god\r\nfor it, so that the people might not die of hunger. Cortés reassured\r\nthem,[603] and ordered a general prayer for relief. “The following\r\nday,” says Tapia, “we marched in procession to the temple, under a\r\nblazing sun.” While mass was being said a cloud might be seen gathering\r\non Mount Tepcaquilla, and “on our way back the rain fell so heavily\r\nthat we had to wade in water up to our ankles.” The rain continued\r\nfor several days, and the harvest turned out abundant.[604] Each party\r\nclaimed the meteorological display as a direct answer to its prayer,\r\nfor the Mexicans were hardly prepared to yield everything without a\r\nstruggle. To this insignificant and hated band of intruders they had\r\npractically abandoned their country, by acknowledging serfdom with\r\ntribute. Daily they submitted to wrongs and indignities. The sacred\r\nperson of their king had been profaned, their nobles brought to the\r\ndust. Now should they submit to this destruction of their gods? If\r\nso, the heavens and earth would come together, grinding them to powder!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [555] ‘Visto por el rey Cacama el poco ánimo y determinacion\r\n     de los Mexicanos, se salió de la ciudad y se fué á la de\r\n     Tezcuco, para juntar sus gentes.’ _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 298, and _Torquemada_, i. 459. But it is doubtful\r\n     whether he remained many days in Mexico after the seizure\r\n     of his uncle, if indeed he was there then.\r\n\r\n     [556] Bernal Diaz assumes, naturally enough for a Spanish\r\n     conqueror, that one of the main objects of Cacama was to\r\n     rescue the imperilled treasures at Mexico. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     79-80.\r\n\r\n     [557] ‘Aun dezian, que le venia de derecho el Reyno, y\r\n     señorio de Mexico.’ However that may be, he laid a claim to\r\n     the Aztec throne, and Cacama replied that to himself alone\r\n     should that belong. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 79-80.\r\n\r\n     [558] See _Native Races_, v. 474.\r\n\r\n     [559] ‘Mandó echar presos tres dellos.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 80.\r\n\r\n     [560] ‘Cacama le respondio muy agramente, diziendo que si\r\n     el tuuiera sangre en el ojo, ni estaria preso, ni catiuo\r\n     de quatro estranjeros,’ etc. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 133.\r\n\r\n     [561] According to Bernal Diaz and Gomara, Cortés was\r\n     informed by Montezuma before he and Cacama exchanged the\r\n     severe messages referred to, and that the Spaniard sent\r\n     the first remonstrance, but the emperor, as master, and\r\n     as the person whom the revolt immediately concerned, had\r\n     naturally to take the initiative.\r\n\r\n     [562] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 79. He would not hold\r\n     friendship with him who took away his honor and kingdom.\r\n     The war was for the good of his subjects, and in defence of\r\n     their land and religion. Before laying down arms he would\r\n     avenge his uncle and his gods. He knew not who was the king\r\n     of the Spaniards, nor would he listen to him, much less\r\n     know him. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 132.\r\n\r\n     [563] ‘Con hechizos le teniamos quitado su gran coraçon, y\r\n     fuerça; ò que nuestros Dioses, y la gran muger de Castilla\r\n     ... nos dá aquel gran poder.’ In this last he did not err,\r\n     remarks Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 80.\r\n\r\n     [564] Over 100,000 men. _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 299.\r\n\r\n     [565] ‘Tenia en su tierra del dicho Cacamazin muchas personas\r\n     principales que vivian con él y les daba su salario.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 97.\r\n\r\n     [566] According to Bernal Diaz, six chiefs were sent with\r\n     the imperial signet, which was to be given to certain\r\n     relatives and dignitaries discontented with Cacama, and\r\n     they were to seize him and his council. _Hist. Verdad._, 80.\r\n\r\n     [567] ‘Tambien truxeron otros cinco presos.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 80. ‘Prendieron al Cacama vn dia, estando\r\n     con ellos y otros muchos en consejo para cõsultar las cosas\r\n     de la guerra.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 133. According to\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl, when Cacama left Mexico, partly out of fear\r\n     lest the Spaniards should seize him for promoting a revolt\r\n     there, his brothers Cohuanacoch and Ixtlilxochitl, all now\r\n     reconciled, pretended to fall into his views. Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     recommended Tepetzinco as the place best suited for beginning\r\n     operations on Mexico, and while proceeding to the place in a\r\n     canoe he was carried on to Mexico by his faithless brothers.\r\n     Without Ixtlilxochitl’s aid Montezuma and Cortés could never\r\n     have been able to overcome the powerful Cacama, concludes\r\n     the author. _Hist. Chich._, 298-9. In his _Relaciones_, 389,\r\n     412, the same author states that Cacama was seized not for\r\n     plotting, but because Cortés desired to secure so powerful\r\n     a personage. Brasseur de Bourbourg follows the former\r\n     version, and believes that Montezuma favored the conspiracy\r\n     as a means to oblige the Spaniards to depart. _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 258. There may be some truth in this belief,\r\n     so far as the beginning of the plot is concerned, but it\r\n     must be considered that Montezuma would have preferred not\r\n     to intrust such a movement to a probable rival, the ruler\r\n     of a people jealous of Aztec supremacy, and the ally of\r\n     his most hated enemy, Ixtlilxochitl. If, again, Cacama was\r\n     his tool, the emperor would not have had him seized, to be\r\n     executed for all he knew, when he could have warned him to\r\n     flee or to defend himself. Had Ixtlilxochitl surrendered\r\n     the king, Cortés would not be likely to give the credit to\r\n     Montezuma, as he does. _Cartas_, 97-8.\r\n\r\n     [568] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 133. Yet Bernal Diaz assumes\r\n     that Montezuma examined him and the other prisoners, ‘y supo\r\n     Monteçuma de los conciertos en que andaua, que era alçarse\r\n     por señor.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 80. ‘Y à cabo de pocos dias\r\n     le dieron Garrote secretamente,’ adds Torquemada, i. 470,\r\n     erroneously. Had Cortés fallen into his hands, the stone of\r\n     sacrifice would speedily have received him, and the captive\r\n     must accordingly have regarded himself as mercifully treated.\r\n     The general knew the value of such prominent hostages. The\r\n     leniency gained him besides great credit, as Solis rightly\r\n     assumes. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 21-2.\r\n\r\n     [569] ‘En ocho dias todos estuuieron presos en la cadena\r\n     gorda.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 80. This author\r\n     includes the lord of Matlaltzinco, who escaped his pursuers\r\n     the longest, and when finally brought before the emperor\r\n     spoke his mind so freely that he would have been consigned\r\n     to the executioner had not Cortés interfered. Duran adds\r\n     the lord of Xochimilco instead of the last two. _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, MS., ii. 444. ‘Pigliò ancora il Re di Tlacopan, i\r\n     Signori d’Iztapalapan, e di Cojohuacan, fratelli tutti e\r\n     due del Re Motezuma, due figliuoli di questo medesimo Re,\r\n     Itzquauhtzin Signor di Tlatelolco, un Sommo Sacerdote di\r\n     Messico, e parecchj altri.’ _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._,\r\n     iii. 107.\r\n\r\n     [570] ‘Se llamò Don Carlos.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     80; at a later period, most likely. ‘Surnommé Tocpaxochitl\r\n     ... bâtard de Nezahualpilli.’ _Brasseur de Bourbourg_,\r\n     _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 258. Cortés calls him a son of\r\n     Cacama, _Cartas_, 98, but this he afterward corrects. The\r\n     native records, in _Sahagun_, _Hist. Gen._, ii. 277, and in\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, ignore him. The latter, indeed, assumes that\r\n     Cacama continued to reign, though captive like Montezuma.\r\n     _Hist. Chich._, 299 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [571] Herrera gives the speeches on the occasion. dec. ii.\r\n     lib. ix. cap. iii. ‘Era mas bien quisto, que no Cacama....\r\n     Y Cortes hazia reyes, y mandaua con tanta autoridad, como\r\n     si ya vuiera ganado el imperio.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     133. Brasseur de Bourbourg assumes that Cohuanacoch and\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl at once managed to obtain control of the weak\r\n     youth and of the government.\r\n\r\n     [572] ‘El tiempo andando veremos si tenemos otra mejor\r\n     respuesta de nuestros Dioses, y como vieremos el tiempo\r\n     assi harémos ... presto os dirè lo que mas non conuenga.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 81.\r\n\r\n     [573] The latter had probably tendered his submission in\r\n     order to retain the throne. Ixtlilxochitl names Cacama as\r\n     the Tezcucan king present.\r\n\r\n     [574] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 98-9. ‘Demos gracias a los dioses,\r\n     q̄ an venido en nuestros dias los q̄ tãto desseauamos,’ et\r\n     seq. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 134.\r\n\r\n     [575] ‘Tenia del oraculo de sus dioses respuesta muchas vezes\r\n     ... q̄ perderia la silla a los ocho años de su reynado, y\r\n     q̄ por esto nunca quiso hazer guerra a los Españoles,....\r\n     Bien que por otro cabo lo tenia por burla, pues auia mas\r\n     dezisiete años q̄ era rey.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Max._, 134-5;\r\n     _Acosta_, _Hist. Ind._, 502-3.\r\n\r\n     [576] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 91, 98-9; _Herrera_, dec. ii.\r\n     lib. ix. cap. iv.; _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, ii. 580-1. The allegiance was tendered before\r\n     Secretary Pedro Fernandez. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     81. Solis assumes that Montezuma of his own accord offered\r\n     allegiance and tribute, in the hope that this would fill\r\n     the measure of the Spaniards’ expectations and cause them\r\n     to depart. In that case the general grief must have been\r\n     well counterfeited. He regards this act as giving legality\r\n     to the conquest. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 23-32. Prescott supposes\r\n     that the submission was prompted less by fear than by\r\n     conscience—conscientious obedience to the myth. _Mex._, ii.\r\n     198. Oviedo looks on the tears as evidence of unwillingness,\r\n     and thinks that either the emperor was very pusillanimous,\r\n     or the will of God clearly manifest, iii. 297. According to\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl the kings and caciques were required to leave\r\n     hostages for the observance of their oath. ‘Cacama, y con\r\n     él sus dos hermanos, Cohuanacochtzin y Ixtlilxochitl, segun\r\n     las relaciones y pinturas de Tezcuco, dieron en rehenes á\r\n     cuatro hermanos suyos y otras tantas hermanas.’ He names the\r\n     brothers, and states that Montezuma also had to leave sons\r\n     and brothers. _Hist. Chich._, 299-300. Brasseur de Bourbourg\r\n     supposes, from a resemblance in the surname of the new\r\n     king of Tezcuco to that of one of his brothers’ hostages,\r\n     that he had already been forced to abdicate in favor of\r\n     Cohuanacoch and Ixtlilxochitl, and surrender himself to\r\n     the Spaniards. One of his sisters, baptized as Doña Juana,\r\n     became the mistress of Cortés, as Ixtlilxochitl observes,\r\n     and ‘périt dans la nuit de la retraite, enceinte du fait\r\n     de Cortès.’ _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 262. The readiness with\r\n     which Spaniards ventured, often singly, all over the country\r\n     to exact tribute and to inquire into resources and the\r\n     condition of affairs, would indicate that the prudent general\r\n     had taken the precaution of obtaining living guarantees.\r\n\r\n     [577] ‘Luego mandó que le diese los españoles que queria\r\n     enviar, y de dos en dos y de cinco en cinco los repartió\r\n     para muchas provincias y ciudades.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 100.\r\n\r\n     [578] According to the Tezcucan records, twenty Spaniards\r\n     were sent with two of the king’s brothers, Nezahualquentzin\r\n     and Tetlahuehuezquititzin, to collect the tribute of that\r\n     city. As they were leaving Mexico, Montezuma despatched a\r\n     messenger to the former prince, enjoining him to treat the\r\n     Spaniards well and to obtain a large sum. This whispered\r\n     advice was assumed by the Spaniards to hide a plot, and\r\n     laying violent hands on the prince, the leader carried\r\n     him to Cortés, who had him hanged at once. The king was\r\n     of course deeply grieved, but dared not say anything.\r\n     Guided by another brother, Tepacxochitzin, the Spaniards\r\n     reached Tezcuco, and behaved outrageously. With the aid of\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl they seized the contents of the royal treasury,\r\n     filling with the gold a chest two fathoms in height and\r\n     length, and one in width. After this they compelled the\r\n     chiefs to contribute as much more. Ixtlilxochitl assumes\r\n     that Cacama is the king, and that the deed occurred before\r\n     allegiance was sworn, and seven weeks after the Spaniards’\r\n     arrival at Mexico. _Hist. Chich._, 298; _Id._, _Rel._,\r\n     388-9, 411-12. Brasseur de Bourbourg repeats this story in\r\n     substance, though he corrects it by stating that Montezuma\r\n     interfered and saved the prince. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv.\r\n     252-3. Herrera writes that ‘the servant’ sent to guide the\r\n     Spaniards disappeared on the way. He was caught and hanged\r\n     by order of Cacama, who gave them a more trusty attendant.\r\n     They were received at Tezcuco with great pomp, and presented\r\n     with female slaves. A large amount of gold, pearls, and\r\n     other valuables was obtained, and 80 carriers were sent to\r\n     Mexico laden with honey, which Cortés distributed, while he\r\n     kept the treasures, dec. ii. lib. ix. cap. i. According to\r\n     Vazquez de Tapia, 15,000 pesos in gold were obtained from\r\n     Tezcuco, beside some jewels and cloth. Not satisfied with\r\n     this, Cortés sent Cacama in charge of Alvarado to exact\r\n     more. But little being obtained, boiling pitch was applied\r\n     to the stomach of Cacama before he was sent back to Mexico.\r\n     Alvarado denies this outrage. _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra\r\n     Alvarado_, 3, 35-6, 65.\r\n\r\n     Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl claims our attention as\r\n     a native historian who has labored zealously to vindicate the\r\n     glorious antecedents of his race, particularly the Acolhuas,\r\n     whose loyal devotion to the Spanish invaders he advocates\r\n     with an enthusiasm as unblushing as it is inconsistent. The\r\n     chief hero of the theme is his ancestor and namesake, King\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl, his great great grandfather, according to\r\n     Muñoz’ genealogic list. Little good was derived from this\r\n     calculated zeal, for at Alva’s birth, in about 1568, the\r\n     family estate had dwindled to small proportions, while the\r\n     tribute exemption which testified to royal descent expired\r\n     not many years later. After a course at the Santa Cruz\r\n     College Alva figured as interpreter to the native tribunal\r\n     of the viceroy. The death of the eldest brother brought\r\n     lawsuits which threatened to impoverish him, but urgent\r\n     representation procured, in 1602, a cedula recognizing\r\n     him as heir to the family property. _Florencia_, _La\r\n     Estrella_, 103 etc.; _Becerra Tanco_, _Felicidad Mex._, 49;\r\n     _Guadalupe_, _Col._, 551; _Panes_, _Teatro Nueva-España_,\r\n     MSS. The requirements of the suit called forth more than\r\n     one of his writings, which had in view to establish both\r\n     his own title and the claims of his family. Their research\r\n     and style attracted the attention of the viceroy, who\r\n     encouraged him to continue a task for which he was so well\r\n     fitted, not only by his Spanish and Aztec studies, but as\r\n     a native to whom his countrymen would readily communicate\r\n     their views and traditions, and as the possessor of a vast\r\n     family archive. The command accorded with his inclination\r\n     and improved fortune, and a number of pieces were produced,\r\n     which after his death, about 1648, passed to the Jesuit\r\n     college, _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, i. 10, and thence to\r\n     the Archivo General, where they form volumes iv. and xiii.\r\n\r\n     The most complete list of his works is given in _Dicc.\r\n     Univ._, iv.; that by Boturini is nearly as full, _Catálogo_,\r\n     2 etc.; Beristain, _Bibl._, ‘Alva,’ gives it less so, and\r\n     Clavigero’s is still briefer, while Pinelo, _Epitome_, ii.\r\n     608, makes merely a general allusion. Kingsborough, on the\r\n     other hand, offers an almost complete reproduction of the\r\n     writings in volume ix. of his _Mex. Antiq._ The longest and\r\n     most important is the _Historia Chichimeca_, dedicated to the\r\n     viceroy, in 95 chapters, of which the first 76 treat of the\r\n     rise and progress of the Chichimec empire, represented at the\r\n     conquest by the Acolhuas, and of its glories as inherited\r\n     by his ancestors, the kings of Tezcuco. The remaining 19\r\n     chapters relate to the conquest by the Spaniards, and are\r\n     incomplete. It is the most carefully written of the series,\r\n     elaborated partly from previous manuscripts, partly from\r\n     fresh researches, while the account of the conquest rests\r\n     also on the testimony of eye-witnesses, reinforced by\r\n     additions from Gomara and other sources, as he admits on\r\n     pp. 300, 303. An allusion to Torquemada shows that it could\r\n     not have been completed before 1615, and it was probably\r\n     his last work. More than one copy is extant, from one of\r\n     which Ternaux-Compans printed a French translation, while\r\n     the best issue, that of Kingsborough, is after a copy from\r\n     Veytia. The material has been largely used, and Veytia’s\r\n     _Hist. Ant. Mej._ may be said to rest upon it. The more\r\n     important of the other writings are, _Sumaria Relacion\r\n     de todas las cosas en la Nueva-España, y que los tultecas\r\n     alcanzaron_, in 5 relations, which treat of the mythical\r\n     period from the creation of the world, according to native\r\n     tradition, to the fall of the Toltecs; _Historia de los\r\n     Señores Chichimecas_, in 12 relations, which brings the\r\n     history down to the Spanish conquest; _Noticias de los\r\n     pobladores y naciones de Nueva España_, in 13 relations; the\r\n     first 12 quite short, and relating to native peoples; the\r\n     last of considerable length, and dwelling on the conquest.\r\n     Cárlos María de Bustamante published the 13th relation in\r\n     separate form, to which, under an excess of patriotic zeal,\r\n     he gave the abnormal title of _Horribles Crueldades de los\r\n     Conquistadores_, Mexico, 1829. Notes were appended, and\r\n     considerable liberties taken with text, so as to increase\r\n     the odium against the conquerors. Ternaux-Compans included\r\n     a French translation of it in his collection. Kingsborough\r\n     has printed eleven shorter pieces by Ixtlilxochitl, and\r\n     a few more are attributed to his pen, as a translation\r\n     of Nezahualcoyotl’s poems, a fragment of the same king’s\r\n     biography, and a history of the Virgin of Guadalupe; but\r\n     the last two are doubtful. Several of the pieces are mere\r\n     repetitions and summaries under different titles, connected\r\n     with the author’s pleadings, while the 13th relation may be\r\n     termed a cleverly prepared biography of his great namesake,\r\n     from the exaggerated prominence given to his services for\r\n     the Spanish cause. Prescott’s several blunders on this and\r\n     other points are probably due as much to a want of access\r\n     to sufficient material as to a hasty study.\r\n\r\n     Throughout these writings are evidences of the patriotic\r\n     spirit which prompted Ixtlilxochitl in the study and\r\n     translation of the painted records of his people; and\r\n     every now and then gleams forth a very natural hatred of\r\n     the Spanish oppressor, so marked indeed as once to call\r\n     forth the condemnation of an official censor. Otherwise the\r\n     narrative of events connected with the conquerors are closely\r\n     masked; for the sake of private aims and the common fear of\r\n     the white masters. As a consequence many troublesome facts\r\n     are hidden and many questions smoothed to the detriment\r\n     of history. The narratives are also extremely confusing\r\n     in dates, and to a great extent in arrangement, while the\r\n     interest is diminished by trivial details and improbable\r\n     stories. But these were the faults of his time rather than\r\n     of himself. He did wonderfully well in grappling with misty\r\n     traditions, enveloped as they were in the intricate mazes of\r\n     hieroglyphics. And he is justly entitled to our admiration,\r\n     and to the gratitude of his countrymen, for rescuing from\r\n     now unattainable sources so large a mass of material to\r\n     illustrate the glories of his race. His style indicates a\r\n     scholar from whom even his Spanish contemporaries might have\r\n     taken lessons, for the language is exceedingly clear for\r\n     this period, and full of graceful sentences and striking\r\n     descriptions, rendering him not unworthy to be called the\r\n     Livy and the Cicero of Anáhuac, as Prescott and Bustamante\r\n     respectively entitle him.\r\n\r\n     [579] Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 83, gives a description\r\n     of these and other presents.\r\n\r\n     [580] ‘Que se llamaba _Totocalco_.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, 26.\r\n\r\n     [581] _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._,\r\n     ii. 581; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 135; _Herrera_, dec. ii.\r\n     lib. ix. cap. iv. Bernal Diaz assumes that the Axayacatl\r\n     treasures were those now given; but the testimony of the\r\n     eye-witnesses, Tapia and Ojeda, confirmed and accepted\r\n     by Gomara and Herrera, shows that they were given on a\r\n     previous occasion already referred to. Still, Bernal Diaz\r\n     does mention that after the melting of the rougher jewels\r\n     new presents came from Montezuma. _Hist. Verdad._, 82-3. He\r\n     is very confusing, however, in his account of the treasures\r\n     generally; and Clavigero, Prescott, and others, have allowed\r\n     themselves to follow him too closely in this and other\r\n     instances.\r\n\r\n     [582] ‘Como de vn Real, y del tamaño de vn toston de a\r\n     quatro.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 83.\r\n\r\n     [583] _Probanza de Lejalde_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._,\r\n     i. 421-2. Cortés, _Cartas_, 100-1, is not so explicit with\r\n     regard to the latter figure, saying merely that he had\r\n     set apart for the king unbroken jewels and other objects\r\n     valued at over 100,000 ducats; but, since this figure comes\r\n     in connection with the account of one fifth of all the\r\n     treasures reserved for the sovereign, it may be assumed that\r\n     the 100,000 formed also a fifth of the unbroken lot. This,\r\n     consisting to a great extent of precious stones, pearls,\r\n     cotton, and other effects, could not have all been reserved\r\n     for the king. It seems besides improbable that so large a\r\n     proportion of treasure as 100,000 ducats should a second\r\n     time have been taken from the soldiers, even if Montezuma had\r\n     destined them especially for their ruler. All the treasures\r\n     and gifts acquired were obtained by the efforts of the\r\n     expedition, and were always regarded as a part of its fund.\r\n     Yet Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 135-6, who had the statements of\r\n     Cortés and others at his disposal, writes that the 100,000\r\n     lot was selected from the treasures, previous to melting,\r\n     in order to form a present for the king in connection with\r\n     the one fifth. Bernal Diaz writes confusedly that the heaps\r\n     of unmelted gold from which feathers and other settings\r\n     had been removed were valued at 600,000 pesos. ‘This did\r\n     not include the plates, quoits, and dust of gold, nor the\r\n     silver and other treasures.’ A few lines further he says\r\n     that the royal officials declared the gold, melted, and in\r\n     quoits, dust, and jewels, to be worth over 600,000 pesos,\r\n     beside the silver and many jewels not valued. From these\r\n     lots the distribution was made for king and expedition.\r\n     Many soldiers declared that the original amount was larger,\r\n     one third having been abstracted by the leaders. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 83. The marginal print in this authority calls\r\n     the above sums pesos de oro, which increases the value three\r\n     times. Confusing as this version is, it confirms at any rate\r\n     the supposition that the unbroken jewels were also divided\r\n     among the members of the expedition. Prescott estimates the\r\n     whole treasure in the money value of his time at $6,300,000,\r\n     which may be accepted as sufficiently approximate. See\r\n     _Mex._, ii. 202-5. Robertson accepts Bernal Diaz’ last\r\n     estimate in pesos, which is equivalent to about two fifths\r\n     of Prescott’s. The small proportion of silver indicates how\r\n     little the natives understood and resorted to mining, and\r\n     how insignificant a portion of the metallic wealth of the\r\n     country was represented by the treasures so far acquired.\r\n     Gold was obtained from loose and shallow alluvial deposits\r\n     in and near the rivers, and it was only in the extraction\r\n     of tin and copper that the Indians exhibited an advance in\r\n     the art of mining. Robertson is wrong in assuming that gold\r\n     was not used as a trade medium; still, it was only partly\r\n     so, and it was chiefly sought for ornaments. The rarity of\r\n     silver made this metal far more valuable than in Europe,\r\n     and the stones most esteemed were regarded by the Spaniards\r\n     as so many pebbles. For an account of mines, metals, and\r\n     money among the Aztecs, see _Native Races_, ii. In vol. i.\r\n     chap. iii. note 8 of the Central American division of the\r\n     present work is given information on the currency of this\r\n     period.\r\n\r\n     [584] For a description, see _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 100-1;\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 135-6; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     ix. cap. iv.; _Peter Martyr_, dec. v. cap. iii.; _Oviedo_,\r\n     iii. 298-9.\r\n\r\n     [585] Consisting of 32,400 and odd pesos de oro of melted\r\n     gold; 100,000 ducats’ worth of unbroken jewels, feathers,\r\n     etc.; and 100 and more marcos of silver. _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     100-1. ‘Lo dieron é entregaron á Alonso de Escobar.’\r\n     _Probanza de Lejalde_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 422.\r\n\r\n     [586] The expenditures were represented largely by a number\r\n     of unpaid notes of hand issued by the captain-general to\r\n     the owners of vessels, provisions, and arms, and held for\r\n     the most part by captains and leading members of the party.\r\n     Many of the names and claims are given in _Probanza de\r\n     Lejalde_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 411 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [587] Bernal Diaz appears to say that all these men, from\r\n     priests to archers, received double rates, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     83-4, and Herrera so accepts it, dec. ii. lib. ix. cap.\r\n     v.; but this seems unequal. In the _Probanza de Lejalde_,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 411 et seq., a number of\r\n     special payments are mentioned, and also wages for sailors.\r\n\r\n     [588] ‘Soldados huuo q tomaron sus partes a cien pesos.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 84. But this sum may mean\r\n     pesos de oro, which according to the calculation accepted\r\n     represents nearly $1200.\r\n\r\n     [589] ‘Cortes, so color de hazer justicia, porq̄ todos le\r\n     temiessemos, era con grandes mañas.’ It appears that Mejía,\r\n     on hearing the men complain, spoke to Cortés about missing\r\n     gold, and thenceforth they were not very friendly. Noticing\r\n     that Velazquez was in fetters, Montezuma asked the general\r\n     for the cause, and was told that, not satisfied with his\r\n     share of gold, he wished to make a tour of the towns to\r\n     demand more, and perhaps to commit excesses. The emperor\r\n     asked that he be allowed to go, and Cortés consented with\r\n     apparent reluctance. A sentence seems to have been passed\r\n     for the culprit to leave camp, and he proceeded with a\r\n     Mexican official to Cholula, whence he returned with more\r\n     gold a few days later. So runs the story of Bernal Diaz,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 84-5. B. V. de Tapia declares that Cortés\r\n     kept him ‘muchos dias en una casylla pequeña e con guardas.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. 40-1.\r\n\r\n     [590] _Id._, and _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. ix. cap. v.\r\n\r\n     [591] Among those who took most to heart the disappointing\r\n     distribution was Juan de Cárdenas, a pilot and sailor of\r\n     Triana, who had a wife and children in Spain. Tired of\r\n     struggling with poverty at home he had come to seek a better\r\n     lot with the conquerors in America. The first sight of the\r\n     treasures to be divided had inspired him with an ardent\r\n     hope of being able to return to his family, for an equal\r\n     division would have given him quite a little fortune. Finding\r\n     his dream of happiness shattered he became almost raving.\r\n     Cortés gave him 300 pesos, and promised that he should be\r\n     sent home by the first opportunity. Cárdenas appeared to be\r\n     satisfied, but on reaching Spain he came forward as a bitter\r\n     opponent of the general. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     84. Solis speaks up in behalf of his hero, and condemns\r\n     the men as avaricious and ungrateful for demanding more\r\n     than their share. The leaders and best men deserved larger\r\n     gains. As for Bernal Diaz, ‘Habla mas como pobre soldado,\r\n     que como historiador.’ _Hist. Mex._, ii. 35. The share for\r\n     Villa Rica was sent to Tlascala, says Bernal Diaz, whither\r\n     rumor had it that large sums were forwarded for Cortés\r\n     and others, who claimed afterward that they had been lost\r\n     during the uprising. ‘Las piedras bajas y plumages, todo lo\r\n     tomaron los Indios de Tlaxcala.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._,\r\n     26.\r\n\r\n     [592] The cards, made by Pedro Valenciano from drumskins,\r\n     were as neatly painted as those of Spain. _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 84.\r\n\r\n     [593] Herrera gives lengthy specimens of the warrior\r\n     preacher’s effusions, occupying more than one chapter. dec.\r\n     ii. lib. viii. cap. vi.-vii.\r\n\r\n     [594] According to Bernal Diaz Cortés made a sign that he\r\n     and Olmedo desired to speak privately to Montezuma. He now\r\n     proposed that in order to prevent tumult his captains might\r\n     be persuaded to rest content with a space in the great\r\n     temple for an altar and cross. _Hist. Verdad._, 85.\r\n\r\n     [595] Tapia leaves the impression that he called casually\r\n     at the temple, and afterward sent for more troops.\r\n\r\n     [596] In _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 585.\r\n\r\n     [597] Of 30 or 40 men, says Tapia.\r\n\r\n     [598] ‘Fice limpiar aquellas capillas ... y puse en ellas\r\n     imágenes de nuestra Señora y de otros santos.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 106. Andrés de Tapia is still more explicit in\r\n     relating how Cortés insisted on having both chapels cleared\r\n     of idols. ‘El marques hizo hacer dos altares, uno en una\r\n     parte de la torre, que era partida en dos huecos, é otro\r\n     en otra.’ _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 585-6.\r\n     In testifying to the proceedings in the temple previous to\r\n     the massacre by Alvarado, B. V. de Tapia states that the\r\n     Indians intended to restore Huitzilopochtli to the tower,\r\n     ‘donde solia estar por que lo habia quitado de alli D.\r\n     Hernando e puesto a nuestra Señora.’ _Ramirez_, _Proceso\r\n     contra Alvarado_, 36. Alvarado confirms this in different\r\n     words. _Id._, 66-7. The only other eye-witness who refers\r\n     with any detail to the above is Bernal Diaz, and he accords\r\n     only a space on the summit to the Christian emblems. But\r\n     his different allusions to the temple are confused and\r\n     contradictory; yet he has been followed by modern writers:\r\n     first, because the preceding three testimonies have not been\r\n     accessible till late years; and second, because they have\r\n     been content to copy Prescott, who adopts Bernal Diaz in\r\n     only too many instances. The mistake appears also to rest on\r\n     the finding of Huitzilopochtli’s image in one of the summit\r\n     chapels when it was recaptured by the Spaniards during the\r\n     later siege. It is only natural that the Aztecs, on obtaining\r\n     possession of their temple, should have reinstalled the war\r\n     god. Peter Martyr does assume that one image was too large\r\n     to be removed. dec. v. cap. iv. And Gomara intimates that\r\n     idols remained. ‘Pusierõ cruzes e imagines ... entre sus\r\n     ídolos.’ _Hist. Mex._, 128. The phrase can apply to those in\r\n     the court, although his statement may be founded on Martyr,\r\n     as that of Ixtlilxochitl is on him: ‘Y dió [Montezuma]\r\n     permiso que en la capilla del templo mayor ... se pusiesen\r\n     entre los dos ídolos de Huitzilopochtli, un crucifijo, una\r\n     imagen de Nuestra Señora y una cruz.’ _Hist. Chich._, 297.\r\n     As regards the casting-down of idols, Prescott, in common\r\n     with most modern writers, assumes this to be a mere boast on\r\n     the part of Cortés; but a careful investigation, supported\r\n     by the ‘solemn’ assurance of Tapia, not accessible to them,\r\n     confirms this statement in the main. The general probably\r\n     exaggerates somewhat in saying: ‘Los mas principales destos\r\n     ídolos ... derroqué yo de sus sillas y los fice echar por\r\n     las escaleras abajo.’ _Cartas_, 106. This probably strikes\r\n     Oviedo, who, while repeating the account, expresses a\r\n     doubt about its truth: ‘Bien pudo Dios dar lugar á ello;\r\n     pero para mí yo tengo por maravilla, é grande, la mucha\r\n     paçiençia de Monteçuma é de los indios.’ iii. 303. Solis\r\n     even doubts that altar and cross were ever erected in so\r\n     unclean a spot, amid idols and idolatrous priests: it would\r\n     have been sacrilege; besides the Mexicans would never have\r\n     permitted the intrusion. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 9-12. The doubt\r\n     expressed against Cortés’ boast rests chiefly with Bernal\r\n     Diaz, whose faulty account states that Montezuma by mere\r\n     persuasion sent for the priests, and after consulting with\r\n     them had a space on the temple summit quietly assigned to\r\n     the Spaniards. _Hist. Verdad._, 85. Gomara devotes several\r\n     pages to the casting down of the idols, which he justly\r\n     regards as a memorable feat: ‘Mas honra y prez gano Cortés\r\n     con esta hazaña Christiana, que si los venciera en batalla.’\r\n     He applies it, however, to the occasion of the imperial\r\n     prisoner’s first visit to the temple. Montezuma stops Cortés\r\n     in the midst of his destructive work and checks the fury of\r\n     the crowd, which the general thereupon appeases with a long\r\n     profound speech on theologic mysteries, carefully prepared\r\n     by Gomara. _Hist. Mex._, 126-8. The preceding points assume\r\n     importance when it is considered that the usurpation of\r\n     the great pyramid by Christian emblems gave the strongest\r\n     impulse to the uprising soon to follow.\r\n\r\n     [599] ‘É puso en una parte la imágen de Nuestra Señora en un\r\n     retablico de tabla, é en otro la de Sant Cristóbal, porque\r\n     no habie estonces otras imágines.’ _Rel._, loc. cit. It is\r\n     generally assumed by the faithful that the virgin’s image\r\n     is identical with the one now known as the Vírgen de los\r\n     Remedios, in its celebrated shrine near Mexico. It had been\r\n     given to Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte by his brother, an\r\n     Augustine friar, when he departed for the Indies. During\r\n     the uprising in June, 1520, the image is believed to have\r\n     of its own accord taken flight to the site where a shrine\r\n     afterward rose in its honor. _Medina_, _Chrón. de San Diego\r\n     de Mex._, 30; _Cabrera_, _Escudo Armas_, 106-25; _Lorenzana_, in\r\n     _Cortés_, _Hist. N. Esp._, 138 et seq.; _Bustamante_, _Mem.\r\n     Piedad Mex._ Unfortunately for this belief, Tapia’s testimony\r\n     describes the image as a picture on a board, while the\r\n     Remedios image is a little battered doll. The testimony is\r\n     contradicted by nothing but pious supposition. In preparing\r\n     the site for altars the Spaniards noticed that the walls\r\n     were of unusual thickness. Breaking them open they found\r\n     a number of jewels. Gold was also obtained from tombs on\r\n     the summit platform, and the curtain pendants and other\r\n     valuables were of course appropriated. _Tapia_, _Rel._, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, 586; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     viii, cap. vi.\r\n\r\n     [600] Montezuma received the returning procession with\r\n     a forced welcome, and gave orders to destroy a series of\r\n     brothels in Tlatelulco, containing over 400 women, whose\r\n     iniquity, he said, had brought the present evil upon the\r\n     city. _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. viii. cap. vi.\r\n\r\n     [601] Herrera devotes five columns to Cortés’ sermon. dec.\r\n     ii. lib. viii. cap. vii.; _Torquemada_, i. 465-7.\r\n\r\n     [602] Or perhaps of the teachers of the faith, who appeared\r\n     with sword in hand to enforce their cruel, rapacious, and\r\n     immoral demands. Herrera believes Montezuma would have become\r\n     a Christian had he dared. dec. ii. lib. viii. cap. ix. But\r\n     Duran states that according to the native records all the\r\n     three captive rulers were baptized, and that Father Olmedo\r\n     had told him he believed such was the case, although the\r\n     rite had not been administered by himself. _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     MS., ii. 445. This question will be discussed in a later\r\n     chapter.\r\n\r\n     [603] ‘Sed ciertos, que de aqui a mañana llouera, y tendreys\r\n     el mejor año que jamas aueys tenido.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii.\r\n     lib. viii. cap. vi.\r\n\r\n     [604] _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.

If\r\nfeeble man by fearful combinations be brought low, surely the gods\r\nmay yet defend themselves from insult.\r\n\r\nHitherto it had been the higher nobles only who harbored designs\r\nagainst the Spaniards, but, while no longer cemented by the accustomed\r\ndespotism, they were held in check by their jealousies, their party\r\npolitics, and fear for their possessions. A stronger influence than\r\nthese was at hand, however. Now for the first time the lesser nobles\r\nand the common people were aroused. The outrage on the idols affected\r\nall. And the clergy, who out of regard for their high-priest, the\r\nemperor, had remained passive, now felt themselves struck in a vital\r\npart. Their influence, supremacy, and means of support were all\r\ninvolved, and the power of the priesthood was as great here as among\r\nother superstitious peoples. How far they worked upon the nobles and\r\nplebeians is not clear, but their interviews with Montezuma, although\r\nheld in secret, out of the reach even of the favorite page, became so\r\nfrequent and earnest as to rouse the suspicions of the guard. It was\r\nsaid that, assisted by influential courtiers, they represented how\r\ndeeply the sacrilegious act had stirred the people, already incensed\r\nby the shameful captivity of their sovereigns. Further than this,\r\noracles had announced that the gods would abandon the city and its\r\ninhabitants to their fate if the obnoxious strangers were not quickly\r\nkilled or driven hence. The masses would rise, and if Montezuma,\r\nforgetful of his dignity and duty, still declined to be liberated,\r\npreferring the fate of Quauhpopoca, which must surely overtake him,\r\nthen they would choose another monarch.[605] This last threat struck\r\nhome. Sorely had Montezuma sighed for liberty, and he had feared for\r\nhis throne; now his own subjects threatened him with what he dreaded\r\nmost. In this dilemma he turned to Cortés.[606]\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions of the Spaniards had been aroused not only by the\r\nsecret interviews of the priests, but by the somewhat distant manner\r\nof the emperor, and at this unusual summons they became seriously\r\nalarmed. Even the general could not suppress his misgivings as he\r\nhurried to the emperor’s apartments, attended by Olid, then captain\r\nof the guard. With solemn visage Montezuma bade him be seated. Then\r\nhe reminded him of the warnings against his many rash proceedings,\r\nparticularly the installation of the cross upon the pyramid. The\r\nincensed gods at last had spoken, had ordered him to attack and drive\r\nthe Spaniards into the sea, and the people were stirred almost beyond\r\ncontrol. He had only to give the signal; nay, did he delay to do so,\r\nthey would rise. But he loved Malinche; had he not proved this by\r\nhis devotion? He wished to save the Spaniards; and now he warned,\r\nhe implored them to leave the city before it would be too late. They\r\nmight take all his treasures; nay, he would give each man a load of\r\ngold if they would only go.[607]\r\n\r\nThe tone and manner of the prince convinced them that his words were\r\nsincere. Cortés deemed it best to feign compliance. He thanked the\r\nemperor for the interest manifested in their safety, and replied that\r\nsince he and his gods and people so desired it, they would comply;\r\nbut having no vessels, time must be allowed to build them.[608] This\r\nwas perplexing, but Montezuma overlooked everything on hearing that\r\nthe Spaniards were ready to leave. He insisted no further, knowing\r\nwell enough that he and the other captives would have to follow if a\r\nwithdrawal from the city was required before the means of transport\r\nhad been found.[609] He had seen that it did not take long to\r\nconstruct ships, and offered the necessary carpenters to fell and\r\nprepare timber, as before. Meanwhile he would endeavor to appease his\r\nvassals, pointing out that an uprising would be disastrous also to\r\nhimself and them. Martin Lopez was at once sent down to Villa Rica\r\nwith Andrés Nuñez, some chiefs, and a number of Indian workmen, to\r\nbuild three vessels, but with secret instructions to delay the work\r\nin every manner.[610]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCortés had no intention to surrender his hold on the country. It was\r\nnow more than eight months since the procuradores had left for Spain,\r\nand he began to look for their return with a royal commission, if not\r\nwith reinforcements. Once provided with this worshipful paper he could\r\nbrave Velazquez and all the world. He could send to the Islands and\r\nbuy vessels, arms, and supplies; and he could easily enlist all the\r\ntroops necessary to the achievement of his great project. Meanwhile he\r\nhoped to maintain his position, supported by native allies, such as\r\nthe Tlascaltecs, Chinantecs, Goazacoalcos, and Cempoalans. It needed\r\nnot the warning of Montezuma to convince the Spaniards that a serious\r\nattitude had been assumed against them by the natives, and that the\r\nprecautions for defence must be redoubled. The attendants appeared\r\nless obsequious, and the supplies had materially diminished—owing to\r\nthe late drought, they said.[611] This was remedied by the commands\r\nof the emperor. But even the prospect of a speedy departure of the\r\nstrangers did not appear to conciliate the people; and less sanguine\r\nthan their leader, the soldiers of Cortés felt oppressed by gloomy\r\nforebodings. In addition to this they were harassed by extra guard\r\nduty and by being obliged to sleep in their accoutrements, ready for\r\ninstant defence.[612]\r\n\r\nWe must now go back to Cuba for a moment, where long since we left the\r\nirate governor cursing. Poor Velazquez! Córdoba, Grijalva, Cortés,\r\nall the deputies sent out to conquer for him new lands, had only\r\nbeen a drain on him, bringing back little compensation in slaves and\r\ngold. Deeply as he felt these troubles they had not yet affected his\r\nobesity, and it was with difficulty that he waddled about his island\r\nstirring up avengers. With the aid of Fonseca the chaplain, Benito\r\nMartin, whom Velazquez had sent to Spain on his behalf, had obtained\r\nfor him a royal commission,[613] with the title of adelantado of\r\nthe lands lately discovered under his auspices to the westward; and\r\nOctober, 1519, saw busy preparations on the island for an expedition\r\nas well against Cortés as Montezuma.[614]\r\n\r\nThere was no trouble in obtaining men. The rumors created by the visit\r\nof Puertocarrero and Montejo left the impression that ship-loads of\r\ngold had been forwarded from the new region to Spain, and the island\r\nwas consequently in a ferment with excitement. So great indeed became\r\nthe desire to enlist that Velazquez would in any case have been obliged\r\nto form an expedition to prevent the people from going on their own\r\naccount to reinforce Cortés.[615] At first it was announced that the\r\ngovernor would go in person, and so prevent further rebellion. But\r\nVelazquez never thought of such a thing: he was too corpulent, he\r\nlacked courage, and he could not abandon his interests and his post\r\nin Cuba, leaving the island scantily provided with defenders. Further\r\nthan this, he had confidence in the legal right conferred on him over\r\nthe new country and over any expedition he might send. His announced\r\nreasons were the duties of his office, which demanded his presence\r\nmore than ever owing to the prevalent small-pox epidemic.[616]\r\n\r\nAmong the many candidates eager for the command were Baltasar Bermudez,\r\na relative, Vasco Porcallo de Figueroa, and Pánfilo de Narvaez, the\r\nfirst two mentioned already in connection with Cortés’ appointment.\r\nWith Bermudez the governor could come to no arrangement, and with\r\nPorcallo he managed to quarrel after selecting him,[617] so that he\r\nwas left with no other choice than Narvaez. This was the hidalgo of\r\nValladolid,[618] whom we have met before, who had joined Velazquez\r\nshortly after his arrival in Cuba, and had taken a leading part in its\r\nconquest. This over, he had married a rich widow, María de Valenzuela,\r\npossessing a number of towns, and had accepted civil positions, such\r\nas procurador for the island, and contador in the newly discovered\r\nregion. Narvaez was about forty-two years of age, tall and strongly\r\nbuilt, with a long face, ruddy complexion, and sandy beard. To a deep\r\nvoice might be added agreeable manners, being quite fascinating in\r\nconversation. His qualities were such as created favorable impression.\r\nOrdinarily he exhibited good judgment, but he was careless, headstrong,\r\nand arrogant. As a soldier he was undoubtedly brave, but deficient\r\nin discipline and foresight; as a general he was far from being the\r\nequal of Cortés.[619]\r\n\r\nBy virtue of his commission Velazquez appointed this man\r\ncaptain-general and lieutenant-governor of the new country, with\r\norders to send Cortés and any rebellious captain in chains to Cuba,\r\nto carry on the conquest, and to administer for the best interests\r\nof the settlement.[620] But the friends of Cortés were not idle. They\r\ncaused representations to be secretly made to the audiencia[621] that\r\na fratricidal war was about to be opened in the new region, ruinous\r\nto the interests of God and the king, and legal steps were at once\r\ntaken by the promotor fiscal.[622] The policy of Cortés in sending\r\nprocuradores to Spain, with presents and messages to the king, had\r\nits effect on the audiencia, which considered not only that his case\r\nhad passed beyond them, but that he was rendering, and likely to\r\nrender, greater service to the royal interest than was his rival.\r\nBy no means predisposed in favor of Velazquez, they moreover sent\r\nto Cuba the prudent licentiate Lucas Vazquez de Aillon, a member of\r\ntheir body, with instructions to prevent the threatened danger.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Pedro de Ledesma, secretary to the audiencia, and the\r\nalguacil mayor, Aillon met Narvaez at Yagua,[623] preparing with\r\na portion of the fleet to join the rest at Guaniguanico. Placing\r\nthe captain under injunction not to leave Cuba, he proceeded to the\r\nrendezvous and represented to Velazquez the evil which must result\r\nfrom his project, urging that his duty as governor and loyal subject\r\ndemanded him to forego personal vengeance and interest, and finally\r\nforbidding the expedition without express permission from the king. The\r\ngovernor, who appears to have obtained more definite news from Spain\r\nregarding the wealth and promises of New Spain, was more determined\r\nthan ever to carry out his scheme. Relying upon the grant of the\r\ncountry to himself, he considered that he had every right to claim\r\nhis own and to treat Cortés as an interloper. At first he refused\r\nto recognize the jurisdiction of the audiencia in the matter, but\r\npretended finally to fall in with Aillon’s views.\r\n\r\nIt was accordingly agreed that, in order to promote the interests both\r\nof king and governor, by rendering available the costly preparations\r\nmade, the fleet should proceed to its destination, but without\r\nIndians, and with a less number of settlers than had volunteered.\r\nNarvaez might present the claims of his principal upon Cortés, but\r\nonly in a peaceable manner, without landing any forces. If they were\r\nnot entertained, he must sail onward in quest of new discoveries.[624]\r\n\r\nIn the presence of Aillon instructions were given to Narvaez in\r\naccordance with the agreement, but the former nevertheless resolved\r\nto accompany the expedition and watch over their observance, for he\r\nsuspected the sincerity of both parties.[625]\r\n\r\nThe expedition was the largest which had as yet been fitted out in\r\nthe New World, and consisted of eleven large and seven small vessels,\r\nwith somewhat over nine hundred soldiers, including eighty men with\r\nfire-arms, one hundred and twenty with cross-bows, and eighty horsemen.\r\nThere were also several hundred Indians, a large force of sailors,\r\nand a park of artillery, together with ample stores of all kinds.[626]\r\n\r\nSail was set early in March, 1520, and after touching at Cozumel\r\nIsland to pick up the party which had been left there[627] some time\r\nbefore, they entered Rio de Tabasco to obtain water and provisions.\r\nThe inhabitants fled from the town on seeing so large a force, but\r\nwith the aid of an interpreter found there they were reassured, and\r\nbrought maize and fowl, together with three women, as presents for\r\nthe captain. Four days after leaving the river the fleet was dispersed\r\nby a storm, with the loss of six vessels and a number of soldiers and\r\nsailors.[628] The rest of the vessels arrived at San Juan de Ulua in\r\nthe latter part of April.[629]\r\n\r\nThree soldiers, deserters from the exploring expedition[630] of Cortés,\r\ncame on board, and after declaring allegiance to Narvaez, poured into\r\nthe ears of their wondering countrymen the story of their general’s\r\nbrilliant achievements. They told of the vast extent and resources\r\nof the country, of the wealth accumulated, the unfairness of Cortés\r\nin dividing, and the consequent discontent of the soldiers and the\r\ndanger of their position.[631] This tended to render the conceited\r\nNarvaez over-confident, so that his rival was rather benefited than\r\ninjured by the story of the deserters. He now told Aillon that he\r\nwould land, since Cortés was so far in the interior and the vessels\r\nin a bad condition. He was also determined to form a settlement, and\r\nregardless of the oidor’s protest a town was founded for a second\r\ntime upon the site of the present Vera Cruz.[632] The governor of\r\nCuetlachtlan hastened to send presents of supplies, as an act of\r\ncourtesy to a captain whom he supposed to be the friend of Cortés.\r\nHe was undeceived, however, and told by the deserters that Narvaez\r\nwas the real envoy and captain sent by the king, while Cortés and\r\nhis men were fugitive adventurers whom Narvaez would punish. His\r\nking had heard of the outrage on the emperor, and had sent him to\r\nprocure his release, to restore order, and thereupon to return. The\r\ngovernor reported this to Montezuma, who, thinking no doubt that it\r\nwould be prudent to secure the friendship of so powerful a commander,\r\nwhether he came as liberator or oppressor, sent him a number of\r\nvaluable presents, and gave orders to provide his army with supplies.\r\nNarvaez kept the valuables for himself, a course which did not tend\r\nto increase his popularity, and transmitted in return a few trinkets\r\nto the monarch, with assurances of his good-will.[633]\r\n\r\nHearing that Velazquez de Leon was leading a large force not far\r\noff, Narvaez sent a message, appealing to him as a relative and old\r\nfriend to join him with his men; but Velazquez, who was still in the\r\nregion in and above Chinantla, looking for tribute and gold, deigned\r\nnot even to reply, but forwarded the letter to his general and asked\r\nfor orders. Meanwhile he and his lieutenant, Rangel, assembled their\r\nmen and made them swear allegiance to Cortés, a few suspected of\r\nsympathy with the Cuban governor being placed under surveillance.[634]\r\nThe next step of Narvaez was to demand the surrender of Villa Rica,\r\nwhich the deserters represented as held by less than four score\r\nmen. This task was intrusted to the clergyman Juan Ruiz de Guevara,\r\naccompanied by Notary Vergara, Amaya a relative of Velazquez, and\r\nthree witnesses,[635] and letters were given them for distribution\r\namong Cortés’ soldiers, with a view to gain their allegiance.[636]\r\n\r\nSandoval had been advised concerning the fleet, and suspecting the\r\nobject he sent to warn Cortés, despatching at the same time two\r\ndark-complexioned soldiers, disguised as Indian fruit vendors, to learn\r\nfurther particulars. The spies remained in Narvaez’ camp a whole day,\r\nand by mingling with the leaders they picked up valuable information,\r\nescaping during the night with two horses.[637] Sandoval now sent off\r\nthe old and infirm soldiers to a town called Papalote, in the hills,\r\nand obtained the promise of the remainder to hold the fort with him,\r\na gallows being erected in a conspicuous site as a warning to the\r\nfaint-hearted. About this time Guevara appeared before the quarters\r\nof Sandoval. No one came to receive him, and he had to find his way\r\nto the commander’s house. The priest had been led to believe that\r\nlittle or no objection would be made by the adherents of Cortés to\r\nhis demands, and confidently he began his harangue, speaking of the\r\nclaims of Velazquez and the treason of Cortés. The word treason fired\r\nSandoval. His party were the better servants of the king, he said,\r\nand were it not for Guevara’s character as a clergyman he would have\r\nhim chastised for his impudence. As it was, he referred him to Cortés\r\nas captain-general and justicia mayor of New Spain. Guevara likewise\r\ngrew warm,[638] and a war of words followed, which the commander cut\r\nshort by ordering some Indians to bundle the three principals into\r\nnet hammocks. In these they were carried to Mexico, under a Spanish\r\nguard, to be delivered to the general.[639]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Montezuma first received news from the coast governor of the\r\narrival of the great fleet, he supposed that these were the vessels\r\nwhich Cortés had said that he expected, and by which it was hoped\r\nhe would depart. Montezuma at once sent for Cortés to impart the\r\ntidings.[640] The Spanish general was not a little surprised at this\r\nsecond unusual summons, and still more when told that his vessels\r\nhad arrived, and that new ones need not be built. While he was yet\r\npuzzling over the words, the emperor produced the painted message\r\nshowing a fleet at anchor off Chalchiuhcuecan. “You can now leave\r\nin safety, and all will be well,” continued the monarch, overjoyed\r\nat the thought of release.[641] “Thanks be to God, who provides all\r\nthings!” was the fervent utterance of the general, while the soldiers\r\nsent up shouts of joy mingled with discharges of fire-arms. “Surely,”\r\nthey said, “Puertocarrero and Montejo have returned in good time.”\r\nFurther consideration of the matter, however, convinced Cortés that\r\nthese were not the ships of his friends, but that they belonged to\r\nhis archenemy of Cuba. His captains thought the same, and talked\r\nwith calculated effect to the men of the great wrong to them if the\r\nhirelings of Velazquez were to step in and reap the results of their\r\nhardships.\r\n\r\nAnxious to learn something definite, Cortés sent two messengers by\r\ndifferent routes to bring news about the expedition, a third being\r\ninstructed to follow Velazquez de Leon with instructions to await\r\norders before proceeding to Goazacoalco; a fourth messenger was\r\ndespatched to Villa Rica.[642] Learning meanwhile from Sandoval that\r\nthe expedition was inimical to him, Cortés sent letters from himself\r\nand his regidores to the commander, stating the progress of conquest\r\non behalf of the Spanish king, and demanding his object. If he needed\r\nno succor, and came not provided with royal authority, he must at once\r\ndepart; otherwise Cortés would march against him, supported by the\r\nvast forces of the empire.[643] The letters were made the subject of\r\njest among the officers of Narvaez, the veedor Salvatierra declaring\r\nthat the messages of traitors should receive no attention. He urged\r\nthe expediency of marching upon them without loss of time, and swore\r\nthat he would broil and eat the ears of Cortés.\r\n\r\nShortly after the letters had been sent, the approach of Guevara\r\nand his companions was announced. And now for more of that deep\r\ndiplomacy in which Cortés was so skilled. Perceiving the importance\r\nof conciliating men of their standing, he despatched an escort with\r\nhorses to bring them with all honor into the city, and he himself\r\nwent to meet them, expressing regret at the rude treatment they had\r\nreceived. With smooth tongue and promises he wove his web round them,\r\nand “oiled their hands with gold,” as Bernal Diaz expresses it. He\r\nshowed them the greatness and wealth of the country, and explained\r\nto them how it was all in his power; and he sought to convince them\r\nof the injury dissension must occasion to God, to the king, and\r\nto themselves. Ah, rare talent, the talent of tongue! Guevara, at\r\nleast, was won over, and went back delighted with his courtesy and\r\nliberality, and in full sympathy with his cause.[644] On reaching\r\nthe camp he told of what he had seen, the great extent of country,\r\nits vast population, and the number of well built towns on every\r\nside. Nor did he fail to sing the praises of Cortés, and speak of\r\nhis treasures, of which he displayed specimens. Every captain and\r\nsoldier under him, he said, could boast of heavy gold ornaments and\r\nwell filled purses, of numerous servants and beautiful women; and\r\nthey lived on the fat of the land, having the country and all its\r\ninhabitants at their disposal. The general had taken care to exhibit\r\nonly the attractive features of his position, which as now detailed\r\nby the priest captivated the hearts of the listeners, who longed to\r\nbe with so fortunate and liberal a leader. Even before this many were\r\ndisaffected, and despised the arrogant and narrow-minded Narvaez;\r\nothers took an impartial view, and recognized the evil of dissension\r\nin a country only half subdued, while yet others were intent only on\r\nsecuring treasures.\r\n\r\nThe priest brought a letter to Narvaez, wherein Cortés expressed\r\ndelight at finding his old friend commander of the expedition, although\r\nhe regretted that hostile measures had been taken against him, who as\r\na loyal servant held the country for the king. If Narvaez carried a\r\nroyal commission, it had only to be presented to be obeyed; otherwise\r\nhe was willing to come to a friendly agreement, since hostilities must\r\nbe prejudicial not only to them both, but to the crown.[645] Guevara\r\nsupported these expressions by recommending a peaceful arrangement\r\nand withdrawal to new territory, for Cortés was evidently loyal, and\r\nhad hosts of Indians to aid him in maintaining his position. Narvaez\r\nnot only refused to listen to any overtures, but became indignant\r\nwith the clergyman and his companions for advocating them. He knew\r\nthat the forces of Cortés were inferior to his own, and of Indians\r\nhe had no fear.\r\n\r\nCortés had elicited from Guevara a number of facts regarding the\r\nexpedition, among them that the arrogance and parsimony of Narvaez\r\nhad alienated a large proportion of his followers, and that a little\r\ngold would have a wonderful effect.[646] Indeed, they had come for\r\ngold, and had no desire to raise the sword against their brethren\r\nif it could be avoided. This information was not lost on the astute\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\nShortly after the departure of the clergyman, Cortés took counsel with\r\nFather Olmedo, that most admirable of friars, whose knowledge of the\r\nworld, calm judgment, and clear foresight had more than once saved\r\nCortés from himself. Olmedo now undertook the conversion of Narvaez and\r\nhis men. Laden with instructions and jewels, he proceeded to their camp\r\nand endeavored to win Narvaez to peaceful measures. Special letters\r\nand presents were given Duero, Aillon, and others, who were supposed\r\nto be friendly, with a view of obtaining their active coöperation.\r\nCortés wished especially that Narvaez should understand that he was\r\nfriendly to him. Dissension would react on both, particularly on\r\nNarvaez; unity of action could alone promote their common aim and\r\npreserve the country to the king. Cortés had fewer soldiers, but was\r\nnevertheless stronger, from possessing interpreters, knowledge of\r\nthe country, and control of its forces and resources. Were not the\r\nkings already his servants?\r\n\r\nBut Narvaez was stubborn. Olmedo, however, overcame the scruples of a\r\nnumber of his counsellors, who advised him to negotiate with a man so\r\nstrongly established. Narvaez called them all traitors, and told Olmedo\r\nthat he ought to be ashamed of himself for promulgating such base\r\nsentiments; whereat the priest became indignant, and devoted himself\r\nall the more assiduously to the subordinates, among whom he found the\r\nway well prepared by Guevara. His arguments found willing ears, and\r\nhis gold confirmed the arguments. Among his companions from Mexico was\r\none Usagre, an artillerist, whose brother occupied a similar position\r\nunder Narvaez. This man also did Cortés good service. These doings\r\ncould not escape notice, and, warned by Salvatierra, the commander\r\nwould have arrested the friar had not Duero and others interfered.\r\nThey called attention to his diplomatic and religious character, and\r\nthe courteous treatment Cortés had given his own messengers. Narvaez\r\nhurried him away, however, with a letter for his general, wherein he\r\nclaimed authority to take possession of the country for Velazquez.\r\nIf Cortés resisted, it would fare ill with him.[647]\r\n\r\nIt was an easy escape for Olmedo, for Narvaez had not scrupled shortly\r\nbefore to deal with the royal oidor in a most peremptory manner. Aillon\r\nhad remonstrated with him about his proceedings, such as forming a\r\nsettlement, threatening to enter the country, spreading harsh reports\r\namong the natives against Cortés, and neglecting to restrain his\r\nmen from taking property and otherwise abusing the inhabitants. No\r\nattention being paid to this, he formally called upon Narvaez to make\r\na peaceful demand for the surrender of the country, and, if refused,\r\nto go elsewhere to settle. He intimated publicly that the measures of\r\nNarvaez were actuated by malice, rather than by loyal wisdom. This the\r\nvain and arrogant commander could not endure. It was to the oidor, he\r\nsaid, that the present growing disaffection among his men was due. He\r\nwas becoming dangerous, and the municipal officers were directed to\r\nseize and carry him on board the same vessel in which he had arrived.\r\nHis secretary and alguacil were placed on board another, and a day or\r\ntwo after sail was set for Cuba, the captains and crews having been\r\nsworn to deliver them to Velazquez.[648] During the voyage, however,\r\nAillon persuaded his jailers to take him to Española, which he reached\r\nin the last days of August, after a long and dangerous trip of three\r\nmonths and a half. The consort vessel was separated from him during\r\na storm shortly after leaving Ulua, and the secretary and alguacil\r\ndid not rejoin the oidor till October. A report of the outrage was\r\npromptly forwarded to the king, signed by the whole audiencia, with\r\na request that severe chastisement be inflicted, in order to maintain\r\nrespect for that august tribunal.[649]\r\n\r\nAmong others falling under the wrath of Narvaez was Gonzalo de\r\nOblanco, whose advocacy of Cortés and condemnation of Aillon’s arrest\r\nbrought imprisonment, which so wrought upon him that he died within\r\na few days.[650] These harsh and foolish measures engendered further\r\ndiscontent, and half a dozen of Aillon’s supporters, including Pedro\r\nde Villalobos, deserted to Sandoval, who received them with open\r\narms. Others sent to signify their willingness to join Cortés.[651]\r\n\r\nAfter Aillon’s arrest Narvaez had been persuaded to move his camp\r\nto Cempoala, as a healthier place, more suitable for head-quarters,\r\nand better provided with supplies. The cacique was intimidated to\r\nsurrender some effects belonging to Cortés and to accord the new-comers\r\na welcome, which seemed to stamp his conduct as desertion. “Oh, well!”\r\nsaid Cortés when told of it, “long live the last victor.”[652] But\r\nhe could hardly blame the natives for yielding, when even Sandoval\r\nhimself, on hearing of this approach, abandoned Villa Rica and took\r\nrefuge in the mountains, where he remained till the general bade him\r\njoin his forces.[653]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [605] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 136-7; _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 85-6. ‘El diablo q̄ muchas vezes le hablaua, le\r\n     amenazaua.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. ix. cap. vi. ‘Hiço\r\n     Monteçuma aperçebir çient mill hombres de pelea.’ _Oviedo_,\r\n     iii. 507. Others make the number less. To this Clavigero\r\n     objects: ‘Mi persuado che vi sia stata in fatti qualche\r\n     truppa allestita, non però per ordine del Re, ma soltanto\r\n     d’alcuni Nobili.’ _Storia Mess._, iii. 112.\r\n\r\n     [606] Solis sees in this determination only a proof of his\r\n     supposition that the offer of vassalage and tribute was but\r\n     a bribe to satiate the Spaniards, since he now bids them\r\n     go. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 35-6.\r\n\r\n     [607] ‘Yo os daré para vos dos cargas de oro, é una para\r\n     cada chripstiano.’ _Oviedo_, iii. 507; _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 138. Herrera increases this to four loads for Cortés\r\n     and two loads for each horseman. dec. ii. lib. ix. cap. vi.\r\n     And Duran heard that a ship-load of treasures was offered;\r\n     but the pious Cortés was too intent on converting souls to\r\n     accept the bribe. _Pizarro y Orellana_, _Varones Ilvstres_,\r\n     91; _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 86. Montezuma had become\r\n     attached to many of the Spaniards, including the courteous\r\n     general, and really wished them well.\r\n\r\n     [608] ‘Dixo a vn Español de los doze, q̄ fuesse a auisar a\r\n     los compañeros q̄ se aparejassen por quanto se trataua cõ el\r\n     de sus vidas.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 137-8. This author\r\n     and others state that Cortés gives thanks for the warning,\r\n     and offers to go whenever he is bidden. Montezuma, equally\r\n     polite, tells him to select his own time. When ready to\r\n     leave he will give a load of gold to each man, and two for\r\n     himself. Cortés thereupon brings up the question of vessels.\r\n\r\n     [609] ‘Cortes le dixo ... q̄ por fuerça auia de ir el\r\n     Mõteçuma con nosotros, para que le vea nuestro gran\r\n     Emperador.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 86. It is not\r\n     probable that this was said on the present occasion, however,\r\n     and it would only have irritated the emperor.\r\n\r\n     [610] ‘Yd con essos indios, é córtese la madera, y entretanto\r\n     Dios nos proveerá de gente é socorro: por tanto, poned\r\n     tal dilaçion que parezca que haçeys algo.’ _Oviedo_, iii.\r\n     507-8; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 138. Bernal Diaz considers\r\n     this wrong. He knows not what Cortés told Lopez, ‘mas\r\n     muy secretamente me dixo el Martin Lopez, que de hecho,\r\n     y apriessa los labrava.’ Montezuma had demanded that ‘no\r\n     huviesse mas palabras, sino obras.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 86.\r\n     Perhaps Lopez did hurry, from personal fear of remaining\r\n     in the country; or he may have been instructed by Cortés\r\n     to say so to the soldiers, in order to calm them.\r\n\r\n     [611] ‘Comenzó á faltar todo lo necessario para comer y\r\n     beber.’ To remedy this, strict orders had to be issued\r\n     to purveyors, and the Tlascaltecs were sent on foraging\r\n     expeditions, which led to much abuse. _Sahagun_, _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, 25 (ed. 1840), 90.\r\n\r\n     [612] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 138. In speaking of this,\r\n     Bernal Diaz says that he became so used to sleeping in his\r\n     clothes, and enduring hardships generally, that he almost\r\n     discarded the bed during his later encomendero life, and\r\n     could take only short naps. ‘Esto he dicho, por que sepã\r\n     de que arte andamos los verdaderos Conquistadores, y como\r\n     estavamos tan acostũbrados a las armas, y a velar.’ _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 86.\r\n\r\n     [613] This was dated Saragossa, November 13, 1518, within\r\n     a week of Cortés’ usurpation of the fleet, as Las Casas\r\n     observes, and conceded to Velazquez the position of\r\n     adelantado not only over Yucatan, Cozumel, and ‘other\r\n     islands’ discovered by his expeditions, but over any further\r\n     lands that he might find. In connection with this title\r\n     was granted, to him and one heir, one fifteenth of the\r\n     revenue accruing to the king from these lands; and after\r\n     their conquest and settlement one twentieth of the same\r\n     revenue, in perpetuity for himself and heirs, from any one\r\n     island that he might select—the discoveries were supposed\r\n     to be all islands. All supplies of food, clothes, and arms,\r\n     introduced by him during his life, were to be free of duty.\r\n     In support of his expenses a royal plantation near Habana\r\n     was transferred to him, and an annual salary conferred\r\n     of 300,000 maravedís. A number of other provisions were\r\n     made for the promotion of economic, politic, and spiritual\r\n     welfare in the new region. A synopsis of the commission\r\n     is given in _Las Casas_, _Hist. Ind._, v. 2-5. Prescott\r\n     misunderstands the _Carta de Velazquez_ of October 12, 1519,\r\n     in supposing that the governor had not received notice of\r\n     his appointment by that time, and is therefore wrong in\r\n     taking Gomara to task for saying: ‘Estando pues en aqueste\r\n     pensamiẽto [to thwart Cortés], auino que llego a Santiago\r\n     ... cartas del Emperador, y el titulo de Adelantado, y\r\n     cedula de la gouernacion ... de Yucatã.’ _Hist. Mex._, 140.\r\n\r\n     [614] _Carta de Velazquez_, October 12, 1519, in _Pacheco_\r\n     and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xii. 246-51. Solis assumes that\r\n     the preparations of Velazquez were influenced by the news\r\n     of the reception accorded in Spain to the procuradores of\r\n     Cortés. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 42-4. But this supposition, based\r\n     partly on a vague expression of Herrera, dec. ii. lib. ix.\r\n     cap. xviii., is wrong, for the procuradores reached Spain\r\n     only in October, and were detained for some time before\r\n     they saw the emperor.\r\n\r\n     [615] ‘Conociendo que la gẽte, de vna manera o de otra, se\r\n     auia de yr, acordò de recogerla.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     ix. cap. xviii.\r\n\r\n     [616] _Letter to Figueroa_, Nov. 17, 1519, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 400.\r\n\r\n     [617] It appears that Velazquez’ suspicious nature had led\r\n     him to cast reflections upon Porcallo, who resented them\r\n     by throwing up the appointment. Herrera tells the story,\r\n     which is not very interesting. dec. ii. lib. ix. cap. xviii.\r\n\r\n     [618] Bernal Diaz says also ‘Ualladolid, ó de Tudela de\r\n     Duero.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 246, 38.\r\n\r\n     [619] ‘A este Narvaez hizo Diego Velazquez su Capitan\r\n     principal, siempre honrándolo, de manera que despues dél\r\n     tuvo en aquella isla el primer lugar.’ _Las Casas_, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, iv. 4-6; _Oviedo_, i. 496. ‘Dezian que era muy\r\n     escaco.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 247.\r\n\r\n     [620] In a letter to Judge Figueroa, of the Española\r\n     audiencia, dated November 17, 1519, he gives notice of this\r\n     appointment, and states that the object of the expedition is\r\n     to prevent injury to the royal interest and outrages upon the\r\n     natives. That very day he was leaving for Trinidad and other\r\n     parts to aid Narvaez in the preparations. _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 399-403. Narvaez’ appointment is mentioned\r\n     already in the letter of October 12th, addressed to a Spanish\r\n     dignitary, wherein he is spoken of as contador for the new\r\n     countries. _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xii. 250.\r\n\r\n     [621] ‘Auiso y relacion dellos les embió desde Cuba el\r\n     licenciado Zuaço, que auia venido ... a tomar residencia.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 87. But we are safe in\r\n     saying that Duero gave the impulse.\r\n\r\n     [622] This official, Juan Carrillo, laid the case before\r\n     the audiencia, December 24th, representing that Cortés had\r\n     without superior permission made war on the natives of the\r\n     new lands and conquered them. He had also appropriated\r\n     Velazquez’ fleet and captured men from Garay’s party,\r\n     greatly to the injury of both. Velazquez was now preparing\r\n     an expedition against him. The two parties would meet\r\n     and fight, giving the natives the opportunity to rise and\r\n     recover the country. Both Cortés and Velazquez being guilty\r\n     in undertaking such expeditions without authority, the\r\n     fiscal prays that they be punished in person and estate. An\r\n     oidor or his proxy should at once be sent to investigate\r\n     the case and prevent such war. During the following weeks\r\n     Carrillo presented letters and witnesses in support of his\r\n     petition. _Proceso por Real Audiencia de la Española_, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 404-10.\r\n\r\n     [623] Fourteen leagues west of Trinidad.\r\n\r\n     [624] ‘Todo lo qual se asentó desta manera, y lo dió por\r\n     instruccion en mi presencia al dicho Pánfilo de Narvaez.’\r\n     _Ayllon_, in _Carta de Audiencia_, in _Pacheco_ and\r\n     _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiii. 337. For fuller text of this\r\n     agreement see _Ayllon_, _Parecer_, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._,\r\n     i. 476-9. By the time the discovery voyage was concluded\r\n     the king would have decided the case.\r\n\r\n     [625] This creeps out in his report, to which he adds:\r\n     ‘Parecióme que, pues yo principalmente habia ido á estorbar\r\n     que no oviesen debates y escándalos, que debia seguir mi\r\n     camino hasta los dexar pacíficos.’ _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, xiii. 337. The account of his efforts in Cuba\r\n     is also given in a special letter to the king, written by\r\n     him at Guaniguanico March 4th, on the eve of departure for\r\n     New Spain. This letter was detained in Cuba till August.\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xi. 439-42; _Col.\r\n     Doc. Inéd._, i. 481-6. Herrera, who is not aware of the\r\n     agreement with Aillon, assumes that Velazquez and Narvaez\r\n     answer his protests by mere assurances that they intend no\r\n     harm, but will take care of the king’s interest, Narvaez\r\n     ending the discussion by saying: ‘de qualquiera manera se\r\n     pensaua embarcar dentro de dos horas.’ dec. ii. lib. ix.\r\n     cap. xviii. Bernal Diaz also states that Velazquez relied\r\n     so much on the favor of the bishop that he totally ignored\r\n     the protests of Aillon. ‘Soldados dixeron, que venia con\r\n     intencion de ayudarnos, y si no lo pudiesse hazer, tomar la\r\n     tierra en si por su Magestad, como Oidor.’ _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     87. Solis supposes that Aillon hoped to prevail on Narvaez\r\n     when once out of Velazquez’ reach. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 47;\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 117; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 140. The\r\n     governor evidently feared to oppose Aillon’s distasteful\r\n     resolution to embark, lest he should induce the audiencia\r\n     to adopt a more forcible interference; and perhaps he\r\n     thought that his protests could be more safely disregarded\r\n     the farther he was removed from the centre of government.\r\n\r\n     [626] At the review in Cempoala, New Spain, were found 80\r\n     musketeers, 120 archers, 600 infantry, and 80 horsemen.\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 146. Cortés was told by Guevara\r\n     that there were 800 infantry, including 80 archers and 120\r\n     musketeers. _Cartas_, 116. Oviedo has only 800 men, but with\r\n     200 horses, iii. 508, while Bernal Diaz raises the totals\r\n     to 19 vessels, with 1300 to 1400 soldiers, including 80\r\n     horsemen, 90 archers, and 70 musketeers, but not counting\r\n     the sailors. The artillery of guns was in charge of Captain\r\n     Rodrigo Martin. _Hist. Verdad._, 86-7. Clavigero adopts 18\r\n     vessels, 800 infantry, 85 cavalry, over 500 sailors, and\r\n     12 guns. _Storia Mess._, iii. 113. Aillon vaguely mentions\r\n     ‘over 600 Spaniards in sixteen vessels.’ ‘Sin que yo lo\r\n     supiese, llevaron hasta mil indios.’ _Carta_, in _Pacheco_\r\n     and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiii. 337; and Tapia says 1000\r\n     and odd men. _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 587.\r\n     The figures from the review in New Spain must be increased\r\n     by the number lost with six of the vessels off that coast,\r\n     and this may be what Bernal Diaz attempts to do, although\r\n     he evidently makes the estimate too high. Agustin Bermudez\r\n     was alguacil mayor, and Cortés’ old friend, Duero, managed\r\n     to join as contador. _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. i.\r\n\r\n     [627] Eighty Spaniards had been landed, and a number of\r\n     Indians, but most of the latter, together with a large\r\n     proportion of the natives, had died of small-pox introduced\r\n     by the Cubans. To judge from Aillon’s report he appears to\r\n     have allowed a number of Spaniards to remain, with a view\r\n     to make there a calling-place for ships, and which might\r\n     serve as a base for operations tending to the conquest\r\n     of Yucatan. He refers to the latter country as an island\r\n     adjoining Ulua, which he believes is a continent, lying\r\n     near the land discovered by Solís and Yañez. _Carta de\r\n     Audiencia_, Aug. 30, 1520, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, xiii. 338.\r\n\r\n     [628] ‘Se ahogaron cinqüenta ombres é los demas escapamos\r\n     con harto riesgo.’ _Carta de Audiencia_, in _Pacheco_ and\r\n     _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiii. 338-9. Montezuma informed\r\n     Cortés of this shipwreck, ‘é le mostró en una manta\r\n     pintados diez y ocho navíos, é los cinco dellos á la costa\r\n     quebrados é trastornados en el arena.’ _Tapia_, _Rel._,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 586. ‘Tuuo vn viento de\r\n     Norte ... y de noche se le perdio vn nauio de poco porte,\r\n     que dio al traues; Capitan ... Christoval de Morante ...\r\n     y se ahogó cierta gente.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     87.\r\n\r\n     [629] Aillon was among the first to arrive, Narvaez and\r\n     the other captains coming in during the following two\r\n     days. _Carta de Audiencia_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, xiii. 339. Hence Prescott’s date of April 23d\r\n     is somewhat too accurate. Brasseur de Bourbourg assumes\r\n     that a landing is effected on April 20th. _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 276. Cortés states that the news reached him in\r\n     the beginning of May. _Cartas_, 113. Taking four days to\r\n     travel to Mexico, the fleet arrived eight days after the\r\n     ship-building party had left the capital. _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 138; _Alaman_, _Disert._, i. 109. Narvaez’ agent\r\n     in Spain states that the fleet numbered eleven vessels on\r\n     arrival. _Demanda de Ceballos_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, i. 437.\r\n\r\n     [630] Three of the men left in Chinantla, ‘que se dezian\r\n     Ceruantes el chocarrero, y Escalana, y ... Alonso Hernandez\r\n     Carretero.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 87; _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. ix. cap. xviii. Porras gives several and\r\n     different names. _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 500. Cortés\r\n     appears to say that they were the men sent by him to bring\r\n     news of Narvaez and who deserted. _Cartas_, 115. Aillon\r\n     speaks of one man who came on board of his vessel. Finding\r\n     that Cortés had instructed the Indians to regard any foreign\r\n     arrivals as inimical, this man was sent to reassure them.\r\n     _Carta de Audiencia_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, xiii. 339. It appears probable, however, that Cortés’\r\n     expectation of messengers from his king was known to the\r\n     Indians.\r\n\r\n     [631] ‘Alçauan las manos a Dios, que los librò del poder de\r\n     Cortés, y de salir de ... Mexico, donde cada dia esperauan\r\n     la muerte ... y aũ dezia el Cervantes, ... O Narvaez,\r\n     Narvaez, que bien avẽturado que eres ... que tiene esse\r\n     traidor de Cortes allegados mas de seteciẽtos mil pesos de\r\n     oro, y todos los soldados estan mui mal con el.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 87.\r\n\r\n     [632] This was speedily abandoned for a camp at Cempoala.\r\n     Aillon wanted merely a camp to be formed near a well supplied\r\n     town. The municipal officers were: ‘Alcaldes hordinarios\r\n     á Francisco Verdugo, cuñado del dicho Diego Velazquez,\r\n     casado con una hermana suya, é un Juan Yuste, su cuñado é\r\n     mayordomo, é regidores á Diego Velazquez é Pero Velazquez,\r\n     sus sobrinos, é á Gonzalo Martin de Salvatierra é Juan de\r\n     Gamarra.’ _Carta de Audiencia_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, xiii. 342.\r\n\r\n     [633] ‘Conocian en el Narvaez ser la pura miseria, y\r\n     el oro, y ropa ... todo se lo guardaua.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 89, 87. According to Oviedo’s version\r\n     Montezuma held a council, wherein some members favored\r\n     the plan of attacking and killing the Spaniards then in\r\n     Mexico, so as to prevent a junction of forces. This might\r\n     frighten the rest into departing. Others, who were more\r\n     confident, urged that the new arrivals should be allowed\r\n     to come to Mexico, so as to swell the list of victims for\r\n     the sacrifices, and this proposition was carried, iii.\r\n     509. Oviedo’s informant evidently ignores the declared\r\n     object of Narvaez; or, like Solis, _Hist. Mex._, ii.\r\n     64-6, he does not believe that any communication could\r\n     have taken place, for want of an interpreter. But Solis\r\n     forgets the three deserters, and Indian mediums, perhaps.\r\n     Prescott takes the peculiar ground that for Montezuma to\r\n     ‘have entered into a secret communication, hostile to the\r\n     general’s interests, is too repugnant to the whole tenor of\r\n     his conduct.’ _Mex._, ii. 236. Cortés states that Father\r\n     Olmedo had evidence of communication and interchange of\r\n     presents between Montezuma and Narvaez. _Cartas_, 120-1.\r\n     Others confirm this, as: _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, ii. 587; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 141-2; _Carta\r\n     del Ejército de Cortés_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i.\r\n     428-30. The position of the emperor as prisoner, and the\r\n     speedy succession of events, did not permit the relationship\r\n     between the two to develop.\r\n\r\n     [634] Francisco de Lugo being actually secured with shackles.\r\n     _Tirado_, in _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 6; _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 118; _Carta de Audiencia_, in _Pacheco_ and\r\n     _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiii. 342. Oviedo reviews Velazquez’\r\n     conduct in this instance, and concludes that, since Cortés\r\n     gave him the men and appointed him captain, he was bound to\r\n     obey this his immediate principal, unless royal orders to\r\n     the contrary had been exhibited. ‘Si aquel capitan, Johan\r\n     Velazquez de Leon, no estoviera mal con su pariente Diego\r\n     Velazquez, é se passara con los çiento é çinqüenta hombres,\r\n     que avia llevado à Guaçacalco, á la parte de Pámphilo de\r\n     Narvaez, su cuñado, acabado oviera Cortés su offiçio.’ iii.\r\n     316-17.\r\n\r\n     [635] ‘Alonso de Vergara, escribano, é con Antonio de Maya.’\r\n     _Demanda de Ceballos_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 439;\r\n     Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 88, writes Amaya; _Cortés_,\r\n     _Residencia_, ii. 168, 412.\r\n\r\n     [636] ‘Me trajeron mas de cien cartas,’ wherein the soldiers\r\n     were told to give credit to the statements of Guevara and\r\n     his companions, and to rest assured that they would be\r\n     rewarded on joining. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 116.\r\n\r\n     [637] While selling cherries to Captain Salvatierra they\r\n     heard him refer to the treasures of Cortés as a magnificent\r\n     prize. The designs of Cortés against Montezuma and his\r\n     subjects were painted in dark colors. One of the stolen\r\n     horses belonged to this captain, whose raving against the\r\n     spies afforded great amusement to the camp. _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 92; _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, ii. 587.\r\n\r\n     [638] He ordered Vergara to read the provisions. Sandoval\r\n     declared that none but a royal notary should do so, and\r\n     threatened him with 100 lashes unless he desisted. Guevara\r\n     interfered, and was told that he lied, and was a low\r\n     clergyman. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 88.\r\n\r\n     [639] Alguacil Pedro de Solis was in charge. Bernal Diaz,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 88, describes how they wondered at the\r\n     succession of great cities, etc. The guard consisted of\r\n     twenty men. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 115.\r\n\r\n     [640] Gomara describes somewhat minutely the apprehension\r\n     created among the soldiers by this summons, in face of\r\n     the threatening aspect of affairs. _Hist. Mex._, 138-9.\r\n     Bernal Diaz states that Montezuma kept the news back for\r\n     three days, while he communicated with Narvaez. He might\r\n     have delayed longer, but feared that Cortés would suspect\r\n     something. _Hist. Verdad._, 87.\r\n\r\n     [641] While still talking, they received another message,\r\n     saying that troops, horses, and guns had been landed. In\r\n     his joy Montezuma embraced Cortés, exclaiming that he loved\r\n     him more than ever, and saying that he would dine with him.\r\n     While at table both were in good humor, the emperor thinking\r\n     of the departure, the general of renewed conquests. After\r\n     this Montezuma gave daily feasts, in the belief that the\r\n     task of entertaining would soon be over. _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 139. It is more likely that apprehensions prevailed\r\n     on both sides. Brasseur de Bourbourg calls attention to\r\n     the fact that no stranger had till then been so far honored\r\n     as to sit at the same table with the monarch. _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 277.\r\n\r\n     [642] Monjaras gives their names. ‘Fuesen ... tiznados como\r\n     los yndios,’ et seq. _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. 442-3; ii.\r\n     47-49, 134-5. Andrés de Tapia, who had just returned from\r\n     Cholula, after settling a boundary dispute with Tlascala, was\r\n     the fourth messenger. He followed by-paths, walking by day\r\n     and being carried by Indians at night, so that he reached his\r\n     destination in three days and a half. Finding that Sandoval\r\n     had already sent messages, he remained with him. _Rel._, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 586-7. Cortés writes that\r\n     after being informed by Montezuma he received a letter,\r\n     by a Cuban Indian, from a Spaniard who had been stationed\r\n     on the coast to watch for vessels. This announced that a\r\n     vessel had anchored at San Juan de Ulua, which was supposed\r\n     to be that of the returning procuradores. The general now\r\n     despatched his four messengers. Fifteen days passed without\r\n     further news—this is probably a misprint—after which native\r\n     paintings were received showing the number of men landed,\r\n     and with them the report that the messengers from Mexico\r\n     were detained by the new arrivals. _Cartas_, 114-15. A man\r\n     named Pinedo, who fled from the capital, was overtaken by\r\n     Aztecs, at Cortés’ order, and brought back dead. _Demanda\r\n     de Ceballos_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 440.\r\n\r\n     [643] Cortés intimates that a friar carried this message,\r\n     and that one of the questions was the nationality of the\r\n     expedition. _Cartas_, 115. The friar appears to have carried\r\n     a later message. Gomara assumes that Cortés already knew\r\n     who the commander was, and offered his friendship. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 142.\r\n\r\n     [644] ‘A cabo de dos dias ... donde venian muy bravosos\r\n     leones, bolvieron muy mansos, y se le ofrecieron por\r\n     servidores.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 88; _Cortés_,\r\n     _Residencia_, ii. 168, 465, 500.\r\n\r\n     [645] Cortés said that he could not leave Mexico, where\r\n     his presence was necessary for the preservation of peace\r\n     and treasures. _Cartas_, 117-18. ‘Y q̄ se viessen solos.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 142. According to Bernal Diaz a\r\n     letter of similar tenor had been sent on before, by a swift\r\n     messenger, to clear the way for Guevara’s recommendations,\r\n     and Cortés therein intimated that the hostile utterances\r\n     attributed to Narvaez must be due to the interpreters,\r\n     for he was sure that so wise and brave a captain would\r\n     not utter anything to the prejudice of king and comrades.\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 89.\r\n\r\n     [646] ‘Porq̄ dadivas quebrantan peñas.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 89.\r\n\r\n     [647] According to Bernal Diaz, Duero persuaded Narvaez,\r\n     at the instigation of the friar, to invite the latter, and\r\n     to seek by friendly efforts to win him over. Pretending\r\n     to yield to his persuasions, Olmedo told him that if the\r\n     proper persons were sent to confer with Cortés, he could no\r\n     doubt be brought to terms. It was then agreed that Duero\r\n     and others should arrange a private interview between the\r\n     two generals. _Hist. Verdad._, 93; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     ix. cap. xxi.\r\n\r\n     [648] The reason for this separation of oidor and officers\r\n     was to prevent the former from issuing authoritative orders.\r\n     This seizure had been effected just as Guevara returned\r\n     from Mexico. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 118. Hence, Cortés’ letter\r\n     failed to reach him; yet Bernal Diaz assumes that he received\r\n     it, and coöperated accordingly. _Hist. Verdad._, 89.\r\n\r\n     [649] This report, embodying Aillon’s, is dated August\r\n     30, 1520. A formal statement of the case, prepared on the\r\n     arrival of the secretary, was forwarded on November 10th.\r\n     _Carta de Audiencia_, in _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, xiii. 332-48; _Ayllon_, _Relacion_, in _Id._, xii.\r\n     251-2; _Carta al Rey de los Oidores_, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._,\r\n     i. 495-511. The report proved a heavy argument against\r\n     Velazquez’ case, although Bishop Fonseca at first sought\r\n     to keep it back. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 90; _Peter\r\n     Martyr_, dec. v. cap. v.\r\n\r\n     [650] Two soldiers were also imprisoned for speaking\r\n     favorably of Cortés. One of them was Sancho de Barahona who\r\n     settled in Guatemala. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 89,\r\n     100. To Bernardino de Santa Clara, who had aided Aillon in\r\n     the formal demands upon Narvaez, nothing was done, owing to\r\n     his many friends in the camp. _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. ix.\r\n     cap. xx.-xxi. This man was not actuated by friendship for\r\n     Cortés, however.

He might win a\r\nscore of Marathons, but one Paros would ruin all. When embarking in\r\nthis enterprise, he was to all appearance little above the common\r\nadventurer. But rare talents were constantly appearing as required\r\nby occasion. Though sometimes carried away by excess of zeal, he\r\nhad proved himself an adept in diplomacy. And for one hitherto so\r\nsportive and pleasure-loving, his temper was now grave, particularly in\r\ntimes of peril, when his calm self-mastery increased with increasing\r\ndanger. The rhythm of battle was the sweetest harmony that could stir\r\nhis soul, and yet he never fought but for a purpose. On gaining an\r\nadvantage he indulged in no holiday of retrospect or repose; so long as\r\nanything remained to be done no time was wasted in self-gratulations.\r\nHe never turned from danger, but hastened to seek it out, perceiving\r\nit even in the darkness, intuitively, and always looking it full in\r\nthe face. It was while preparing to strike that the enemy received\r\nthe staggering blow, and the advantage thus gained was followed up to\r\nyet greater advantage At no time appears this hero stronger, grander,\r\nthan now, when, without authority, without the royal sanction, in one\r\nsense an outlaw, with the people of the country against him, his own\r\ncountrymen coming to war on him, his force insignificant as compared\r\nwith that of any one of his several enemies, he yet holds them all\r\nat bay, by his iron nerve and ever ready strategic resources, keeping\r\nthem asunder, pitting one against another, playing on the foibles of\r\nthem all as easily and serenely as a lady fingers her guitar.\r\n\r\nGreatly imperilled were now the conqueror’s brilliant visions of\r\nconquest and conversion, of fame and wealth. If Narvaez were to\r\nadvance on Mexico, the Aztecs could not fail to take advantage of the\r\nopportunity, either to join the professed liberator of their emperor\r\nand themselves, or to attack the foreigners’ quarters on their own\r\naccount. This would place him between two fires, to which famine\r\nwould prove an effective ally. If Narvaez remained on the coast, it\r\nwould be to cut off both retreat and reinforcement, leaving him to\r\nAztec vengeance. To abandon Mexico for a campaign against the enemy\r\nwould be to surrender the most important part of the conquest.\r\n\r\nTo divide his forces, so as at once to retain his hold on the capital\r\nand meet this new visitation—such a measure would render his already\r\nsmall force less able to cope with an enemy not only its equal\r\nin courage and military art, but far superior to it in number and\r\nresources. Yet this he determined to do. The revelations of Narvaez’\r\nmessengers had shown how possible it might be, by judicious gifts and\r\npromises, to sow discord in the enemy’s camp. The priests Guevara\r\nand Olmedo, and others of both parties, were even then at work,\r\nand chiefly on their efforts depended his prospects. Thus would he\r\nseduce to his purpose the opponent’s troops, in so far at least as to\r\neffect a compromise by which Narvaez might leave him in comparative\r\npeace.[654] Who shall say that his good fortune may not still favor\r\nhim! And thereupon he resolved to move his camp nearer to the enemy,\r\nso as to be ready for any emergency, and further, to give himself\r\na more imposing appearance by the addition of native auxiliaries.\r\nAnother reason for this advance was by his presence to counteract\r\nthe defection of Indian allies, arising from the parade of a superior\r\nforce by Narvaez, and from the stamping of Cortés as an impostor.\r\n\r\nHe laid the project before his council, showing the danger of\r\nawaiting the advance of Narvaez, whose ill-will had already caused\r\ntheir property to be declared confiscated and their names branded\r\nwith dishonor. Deserters to Sandoval had brought news of serious\r\ndiscontent in the enemy’s camp. Hundreds, they said, would be ready\r\nto come over or to remain neutral if Cortés showed a bold front.\r\nIndeed, the protests of Aillon against a fratricidal war had been\r\nechoed by most of them, intent as they were on obtaining gold, not\r\non slaughtering countrymen. It was in any case better to advance and\r\nsecure a good position, perhaps to surprise the careless Narvaez.\r\nWith God and the king on their side, so they claimed, they could not\r\nfail to conquer. Some objections were ventured upon, but promptly\r\nsuppressed by one of the captains, who reminded his comrades of their\r\nglorious achievements under Cortés, and their probable fate should\r\nNarvaez gain the ascendancy. The result was an unanimous approval of\r\nthe plan proposed; and Cortés thereupon commissioned the captains to\r\nrepresent the matter to the men, and to ascertain who were willing\r\nto follow, and who should remain in Mexico.[655]\r\n\r\nOn acquainting Montezuma with his intention, the monarch questioned\r\nhim as to the reason of the hostility shown by the other force. Cortés\r\nwell knew that it was useless wholly to conceal the state of affairs.\r\nHe had been silent, he replied, in order not to give him pain. He and\r\nhis men had been sent by their king on this mission, and were from\r\nthe royal province of Castile, whilst the forces on the coast were\r\na rebellious horde from the outside province of Biscay, and inferior\r\nto them, as Otomís, for instance, were inferior to the nobler Aztecs.\r\nThey had come with the design of injuring the natives, and Cortés as\r\ntheir protector; but with the aid of his patron saint he would have\r\nno trouble in chastising them, and in securing their vessels for his\r\nspeedy departure.[656] Alvarado, the tonatiuh, would remain in Mexico,\r\nand him he recommended to the monarch’s consideration, requesting that\r\nsupplies be provided and peace maintained. Any attempt at revolt would\r\nreact with terrible effect on himself and his people. The emperor\r\npromised that this should be done, and offered not only guides, but\r\nan army to aid him. The latter was declined, chiefly because Aztec\r\ntroops could not be relied on.[657]\r\n\r\nIt was decided that all who were not wholly in sympathy with Cortés,\r\nshould remain with the garrison left in charge of Mexico, since\r\nself-preservation would constrain them to act in the direction of\r\nhis interest. This force numbered one hundred and forty men, and with\r\nthe loyal Alvarado for captain, Mexico was regarded as secured. The\r\ndefences of the Spanish quarters were strengthened; all the guns and\r\nmost of the fire-locks, cross-bows, and ammunition were left with the\r\ngarrison, also seven horses. Supplies being not over abundant, owing\r\nto the drought, maize and other provisions were brought from Tlascala\r\nto serve in case of need. The men were promised wealth and honors if\r\nthey remained faithful, and their somewhat hot-headed commander was\r\nexhorted to prudence. “You are few in number,” said Cortés to them\r\non leaving, “and yet you are strong; finally, have a care of your\r\nprisoner.”[658]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of May Cortés set out from Mexico with seventy\r\nSpaniards, sworn to implicit obedience.[659] There were also native\r\ncarriers, a number of prominent Mexicans as hostages, and guides who\r\nwere to take them by a short southern route through Aztec territory\r\nto the coast. Montezuma accompanied him to the Iztapalapan causeway,\r\nand there took his leave with friendly demonstration, while a number\r\nof chieftains continued with him for some distance on the way to\r\nthe Huitzilapan plateau. He had no intention of encumbering himself\r\nwith heavy war material, for the little he possessed could not avail\r\nagainst the superior armament of the enemy. His must be a light corps,\r\ncapable of quick movements; stratagem should supply the place of\r\nnumbers. And now what hopes and fears were theirs as they marched on\r\ntoward the sea! Surely so brave a little army was never more beset\r\nby pitfalls and snares.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Cholula they were joined by Velazquez and Rangel, with one\r\nhundred and fifty men, who were now the mainstay of the expedition.\r\nAbout a score of these, suspected of favoring too strongly the Cuban\r\ngovernor, were sent back to Mexico, so that the enterprise might\r\nnot be imperilled by treason. Among the remainder were distributed\r\nthe gold collected by the expedition in the Tochtepec and adjoining\r\nregion, in order to encourage loyalty.[660]\r\n\r\nUnable himself to visit Tlascala, Cortés sent Francisco Rodriguez, with\r\ninstructions to raise a force of her stanch warriors. He succeeded in\r\nenlisting several thousand; but as it became evident whom they were\r\nto meet, the natives recalled only too vividly the terrible effect of\r\nSpanish arms and prowess, and began rapidly to desert, so that only\r\na few presented themselves before Cortés, and they were dismissed\r\nwith presents.[661]\r\n\r\nDuring the march to the coast scouts were sent out by the main road\r\nand through by-paths to gather information of the enemy. Not far\r\nfrom Cholula Olmedo rejoined the army, with a letter from Narvaez\r\ndemanding submission. Of this no notice was taken, for although the\r\nlatter had endeavored to intimidate the envoy by holding a review\r\nof his troops, the brave friar had sounded the disposition of the\r\nmen too truly to be alarmed. He seemed rather disposed to underrate\r\nthe strength of Narvaez, and with a sense of the ludicrous he amused\r\nthe camp with his description of the vanity and carelessness of the\r\nleader, and the arrogant assumption of the officers. When, therefore,\r\nat Quecholac[662] they encountered Alonso de Mata,[663] notary of\r\nNarvaez, who had been sent with four witnesses to advise Cortés of\r\nhis commission and demands, he was told first to produce his own\r\ncredentials as royal notary, and being unable to do so he was refused\r\na hearing.[664] The official mission of the messengers being thus\r\ndisposed of, Cortés soothed their wounded pride with soft words\r\nand hospitable cheer; he gave them presents, and took care before\r\ndismissing them to feast their eyes on the gold and jewels which he\r\ncaused his men to display, and to let them know that thousands of\r\nTlascaltec and other troops were on the way to join him. Their report\r\nto Narvaez was a confirmation of Guevara’s statement, and did much\r\nto promote the growing disaffection toward Narvaez.\r\n\r\nThe army now descended from the plateau to Ahuilizapan, and followed\r\nthe slope northward to Huatusco. This town appears to have been\r\nsituated on the head-waters of the present Rio Jamapa. Half-way down\r\nthis river, about ten leagues south of Cempoala, lay the town of\r\nTampaniquita,[665] which was the rendezvous. A number of Indians who\r\nhere appeared with complaints of outrages by Narvaez were consoled\r\nwith promises of speedy relief. Sandoval had come by a long and\r\ndifficult mountain route to avoid the enemy, and had brought with\r\nhim about sixty able-bodied soldiers, the old and infirm remaining\r\nat Papalote.[666]\r\n\r\nThis addition raised the force to about two hundred and sixty\r\nmen, according to common statement, including the deserters from\r\nNarvaez. Among the number were five horsemen, and a few archers and\r\nmusketeers.[667] They were poorly equipped, for they brought from\r\nMexico little else than well-worn escaupiles, or quilted cotton\r\narmor, shields, swords, and dirks, a miserable outfit in which to\r\nmeet the well armed troops of Narvaez.[668] But the ready resource\r\nof Cortés had found a remedy. He had noticed in the hands of the\r\nChinantecs a spear, twenty feet in length, which struck him at once\r\nas a formidable weapon, either in defence or attack. It would be\r\nparticularly serviceable against cavalry. Immediately on hearing of\r\nNarvaez’ arrival he had sent a messenger to that province with an\r\norder for three hundred of the pikes, to be finished not with the\r\nusual iztli head, but with double points of copper, a metal which\r\nabounded in that region. The natives having previously tendered\r\nsubmission to the Spaniards, Cortés also asked them for two thousand\r\nwarriors, to join him on pentecost day at the rendezvous. Both of\r\nthese requests were promptly granted, and before the Spaniards were on\r\nthe ground the messenger had returned with a force of Indians bearing\r\nthe weapons,[669] with points superior in finish to the models sent.\r\nThe messenger was Tobilla, a soldier from the Italian wars, and an\r\nexpert at arms, particularly with the lance. Under his instruction\r\nthe soldiers soon became expert pikemen, and gained no little praise.\r\nAdd to this courage, increased by many victories, their admirable\r\ndiscipline, their influence over the natives, and their knowledge of\r\nthe country, and the little band assumes more formidable proportions.\r\n\r\nUnder the several influences surrounding him the original fierce design\r\nof Narvaez in his dealings with Cortés had cooled somewhat. The calm\r\nconfidence and caustic wit of Olmedo tended to inspire respect for\r\nhis commander, which was not lessened by the rumor of vast Indian\r\narmies massing under his banner. Nor were his men apparently inclined\r\nto turn the sword against their countrymen.\r\n\r\nBefore the return of Mata he despatched a commission to Cortés\r\ndemanding the surrender of the country, but offering him liberty\r\nto depart for any other region, accompanied by those who wished to\r\nfollow his fortunes. With this object vessels and stores would be\r\nprovided. The bearers of this proposal were his old friend Andrés de\r\nDuero, Guevara, another clergyman named Juan de Leon, and one or two\r\nothers.[670]\r\n\r\nDuero, it will be remembered, had greatly assisted Cortés in fitting\r\nout his expedition from Cuba; in fact, without his intervention\r\nCortés would never have been appointed to the command. Láres was\r\ndead, and it was quite natural, after this lapse of time, that Duero\r\nshould desire to look in on Mexico, and for that reason had joined\r\nthe expedition of Narvaez. Yet his sympathies were wholly with his\r\npartner, and after a warm embrace he came at once to the subject of\r\nhis ducats. Their interview was private and protracted, and appears\r\nto have been satisfactory, Cortés receiving on the one hand valuable\r\ninformation about Narvaez’ plans and position, and Duero, on the\r\nother, coming forth with weighted pockets, as an instalment of the\r\nlarger sum to follow. According to Bernal Diaz it was arranged that\r\nDuero should receive valuable grants and offices if he persuaded the\r\nalguacil mayor and other leaders so to manage affairs that Narvaez\r\nshould be captured or killed, and Cortés acknowledged captain-general\r\nover all the troops.[671] Whatever may have been the agreement, there\r\nis no doubt that Duero promised to promote his friend’s schemes in\r\nthe other camp.\r\n\r\nGuevara and the other members of the commission were also loaded with\r\npresents, and confirmed as supporters of Cortés. As for Narvaez’\r\nproposition, he charged them to reply that he would listen to none\r\nbut a royal mandate, and would hold the country for the king, as was\r\nthe duty of a loyal subject, and to this he and his followers were\r\nprepared to pledge their lives. Still, he was ready to meet Narvaez,\r\neach accompanied by ten attendants, in order that their respective\r\nclaims might peradventure be happily adjusted. It was supposed by the\r\ncaptains of Cortés, who had influenced the proposal, that the result\r\nwould be a division of territory, and to this they were willing to\r\nagree.[672]\r\n\r\nDuero had been requested by Narvaez to persuade Velazquez de Leon to\r\nvisit their camp, in the hope that a personal meeting might win him\r\nto their cause.[673]\r\n\r\nVelazquez’ disregard of the former summons from the enemy had confirmed\r\nthe faith of Cortés in his loyalty, and since a visit to the camp of\r\nNarvaez might lead to important information, he advised him to go; at\r\nthe same time intimating that his heavy ornaments might have a happy\r\neffect on that gold-thirsty crew.[674] With a view to temporize he\r\nwas authorized to offer himself as mediator between the two generals,\r\nand with a supply of gold for bribes he went over to the camp of\r\nNarvaez. There he met a most cordial reception. Gently the commander\r\nremonstrated at his adherence to a traitor who had so deeply injured\r\nhis relatives. “He is no traitor,” replied Velazquez warmly, “there\r\nhas been no treason either acted or intended.” He would not listen\r\nto any overtures, even when coupled with the promise of a command\r\nsecond only to that of Narvaez. “I have sworn loyalty to Cortés,” he\r\nsaid, “and I will remain true.” Nevertheless, that he might not appear\r\nungracious, he promised to use his efforts toward the recognition of\r\nNarvaez’ supremacy. A review of the troops was held to impress him\r\nwith the superiority of the forces with which he might soon have to\r\ncontend.\r\n\r\nA courtier in manner, and with a fine presence, Velazquez quickly won\r\nhis way among the captains and staff; nor did he fail to improve the\r\nopportunity by presenting his general’s cause in the most attractive\r\nlight. No little weight was given to his words by the heavy gold\r\nchain which fell in several coils upon his breast.[675]\r\n\r\nCortés affirms that the proposal for an interview with Narvaez\r\nhad been accepted, and that he was preparing to attend it when the\r\nwarning came that advantage would be taken of the meeting to seize\r\nor kill him.[676] If treachery was intended, it is more likely to\r\nhave originated with Cortés, who was by no means scrupulous, as we\r\nhave seen, while Narvaez appears to have borne the reputation of a\r\nman of honor.[677] It is still more probable that Cortés invented the\r\nwarning in order to be free before his followers, and before Narvaez,\r\nto carry out a more momentous project, which, with the increased\r\nknowledge of affairs in the enemy’s camp, and with the growth there\r\nof his party, had begun to unfold in his mind.\r\n\r\nIt was a grand conception; yet grander still the execution. It was\r\na different matter with a small force to fall upon a well appointed\r\narmy of countrymen; different from war on naked savages, to surprise\r\nthem by night, or otherwise to vanquish them. Yet this was what\r\nCortés now proposed to do. Nor, in adopting this bold measure, does\r\nhe lay himself open to the charge of rashness or recklessness. His\r\nsituation was desperate: he must conquer or be conquered. Cortés\r\nwas no abstract theorist: he dealt mainly in concrete facts; not\r\nnecessarily demonstrated facts, but facts reached often by intuition\r\nalone. With facts, intuitively or practically arrived at, he kept\r\nhimself well stored. He possessed many noble qualities, but on the\r\nwhole, as we have seen, his character was not cast in an immaculate\r\nmould. He was exceedingly religious; and while, as I have said, he\r\nwould not let religion stand in the way of his ambition, yet he was\r\nmore bigoted than any of his followers. Aside from the chivalrous\r\nabandonment of himself to fate, and the brilliant achievements thence\r\narising, there was little admirable in him. He knew nothing of lofty\r\nmagnanimity, although he did many magnanimous acts; he knew nothing\r\nof pure disinterestedness, or a generosity of soul, although he was\r\nofttimes exceedingly generous. He had none of that sense of unswerving\r\njustness and sensitiveness to wrong which characterized Grijalva. His\r\nself-possession never left him. He was a power within himself, and\r\nhe knew it. Thus it was in Mexico now; and for years afterward when\r\nMexico was all America, he was Agamemnon, king of men, the greatest\r\nof Greece when Greece was all the world.\r\n\r\nUnder the present inspiration, he sent Rodrigo Álvarez Chico and\r\na notary[678] to withdraw the proposal he had made Narvaez for an\r\ninterview, and to demand of him the production of a royal commission,\r\nauthorizing his presence there, which commission would be respected;\r\notherwise he must cease meddling with the affairs of the country.\r\nThe followers of Narvaez were to be formally forbidden to obey his\r\norders; and they were to appear before Cortés within a specified time,\r\nand learn from him what the interests of the king required of them.\r\nFailing in this, he would have them seized and dealt with as rebels\r\nagainst his majesty.[679]\r\n\r\nThe cool impudence of this demand, coming from the captain of a little\r\nband of outlaws hemmed in between hostile forces, gave rise to no\r\nsmall amusement in the enemy’s camp. Narvaez chose nevertheless to\r\nregard the matter seriously, receiving the message as an insolent\r\ndefiance. He declared he would no longer show forbearance toward the\r\ntraitor; he set a price on the head of Cortés, announced the estate\r\nof his followers to be confiscated, and proclaimed open war against\r\nthem.[680]\r\n\r\nImmediately after despatching his ultimatum Cortés broke camp and\r\nfollowed his messengers at a quick march.[681] At Rio de Canoas, or La\r\nAntigua, Velazquez came up with letters from Duero and others. They\r\nhad probably been written under a preconcerted arrangement, for they\r\nwere read to the leaders and discussed, the result being a unanimous\r\nresolution to advance. So forward they went, Cortés exclaiming, “Death\r\nto the ass or to him who drives it!”[682]\r\n\r\nCrossing the swollen river with some difficulty,[683] he hurried\r\non to Rio Chachalacas, over a league from Cempoala, where camp\r\nwas formed quietly and without fires.[684] This sudden movement,\r\ncoming immediately after Duero’s interview with Cortés, confirms\r\nthe supposition that a plot had been concocted by them, which was\r\nto surprise Narvaez under advantageous circumstances arranged by\r\nconfederates. There were to be no half-way measures; all must be\r\nstaked on one cast.[685]\r\n\r\nCalling his men round him, he made one of those stirring appeals in\r\nwhich he knew so well how to animate their spirit and touch their\r\nheart. He reviewed their right to the conquest, and their promises to\r\nhold the country for the king. “And now comes this emissary of Señor\r\nVelazquez,” Cortés continued, “full of envy and treacherous design,\r\nto appropriate the fruit of your hard-won victories. This pompous\r\nNarvaez, while seizing your riches and clothing himself in your glory,\r\nwould load you with impositions and brand you with dishonor. Will you\r\nsubmit to this? Will you, who have overcome mighty hosts, who have\r\nseized empires, who even now hold monarchs in your hands, will you\r\nplace your necks in the yoke and humbly submit to the unjust demands\r\nof this instrument of your ancient enemy? God, who has always been\r\nwith us, will still fight on our side, if we will be true to him and\r\ntrue to our king. We must fight, and it is for life; ay, and more\r\nthan life—for honor and glorious inheritance.” Cheer after cheer burst\r\nfrom the men, while the captains hastened to assure Cortés that they\r\nwould follow him to the death.[686]\r\n\r\nAlthough it was generally understood that coöperation was expected\r\nwithin the enemy’s camp, the prudent general made no mention of the\r\nfact, lest it might render the men less self-reliant. He pointed out,\r\nhowever, that their opponents, although more numerous than they,\r\nwere unused to war, effeminate, disheartened from hardships, and\r\ndiscontented with their commander. He explained the arrangement of\r\nNarvaez’ camp, and divided the force into three parties, under the\r\ncommand respectively of Sandoval, Olid, and himself, the position\r\nof the former as alguacil mayor and comandante on the coast, and the\r\nsecond as maestre de campo, entitling them to this distinction, young\r\nas they were, particularly since Cortés retained the direction of\r\naffairs. To the former, aided by Jorge and Gonzalo Alvarado, Alonso\r\nde Ávila, and eighty men, was intrusted the task of attacking Narvaez’\r\nspecial quarters, with the formally worded command to seize him, dead\r\nor alive.[687] As a further inducement toward the accomplishment of\r\nthis important end, rewards of three thousand, two thousand, and one\r\nthousand pesos respectively were promised to the first three soldiers\r\nwho should secure the general.[688] Olid received the important\r\norder to capture the artillery, from which the greatest danger was\r\nto be apprehended. With him were Andrés de Tapia, Diego Pizarro, and\r\nothers. Cortés himself was to follow and render aid where most needed,\r\nsupported by Ordaz, Grado, the brothers Chico, and others.[689] The\r\npassword was ‘Espíritu Santo,’ suggested by Olmedo with reference to\r\npentecost day, on which all these events took place.\r\n\r\nWhile occupied with their preparations a deserter arrived, sent by\r\nDuero, it seems, to warn Cortés that, advised of his approach by the\r\nIndians,[690] Narvaez had taken alarm, and was forming the best part\r\nof his troops in the field[691] between him and Cempoala. To this he\r\nhad been prompted also by the more watchful of his captains, who had\r\nnot failed to observe the growing sympathy for the rival general.\r\nThis most unpleasant change of tactics disconcerted Cortés not a\r\nlittle, and for the time he could do nothing but remain in camp,\r\nprotected in front by the creek. Fortune again came to the rescue,\r\nhowever, in the form of a heavy rain, which fell all Sunday. It was\r\nthe beginning of the rainy season.[692] Most of Narvaez’ men, unused\r\nto military service, and enervated by the frivolous inactivity of the\r\ncamp, found this highly disagreeable, and began to complain at what\r\nthey termed an unnecessary precaution against an insignificant foe.\r\nThe friends of Cortés did not fail to take advantage of this feeling\r\nby ridiculing the manœuvre, representing that no troops, much less a\r\nhandful of boasters, would think of attacking in such weather. They\r\nwould in any case be far more secure within their strong quarters,\r\nand by leaving an advance post in the field timely warning could be\r\ngiven. This appeared to be reasonable, and since Narvaez by no means\r\nrelished the exposure, he gave orders to return to quarters before\r\ndusk, leaving, however, a body of forty horsemen on the plain and\r\ntwo spies at a brook ford, about half a league off. The remainder\r\nof the horses were kept saddled at the entrance to the camp, and the\r\nmen were instructed to sleep on their arms, prepared at any rate to\r\nreoccupy the field in the morning. The watchword was ‘Santa María.’\r\n\r\nCortés was occupied in devising new measures when informed of this\r\nmovement. Pointing out to his men the effeminacy and unsoldierly\r\nqualities of the rabble with which they had to deal, and the\r\ncarelessness and inefficiency of their commander, he ordered an\r\nimmediate advance on Cempoala, where they would now be scarcely\r\nexpected. “You know the maxim,” he said, “‘upon the enemy at dawn;’\r\nbut better still, we will surprise them by night.[693] Let each strive\r\nto excel his comrade in valor.” These words were received with hearty\r\napproval, for anything was preferable to suspense in a dreary bivouac\r\nwithout fire or comfort. Crossing the creek they marched noiselessly\r\nover the plain, through the rain, drenched and hungry. On reaching\r\nthe brook, near the town, they came upon the two scouts of the enemy,\r\nGonzalo Carrasco and Alonso Hurtado; they captured the former, while\r\nthe latter, warned by the cry of his comrade, hurried into camp to\r\ngive the alarm. Carrasco was compelled under threats to answer a\r\nnumber of questions on the position and plans of his party, and was\r\nmenaced with death if he played false.[694]\r\n\r\nA cross had been erected at the ford,[695] probably during the first\r\nmarch to Cempoala, and here the army knelt in all humility to do\r\nreverence. Father Olmedo then gave the men the general absolution,\r\nand appealed to heaven to bless the efforts now to be made in behalf\r\nof their faith and the king, closing with the soul-stirring assurance\r\nthat victory should be theirs. The men, one and all, felt no doubt\r\nthat they were about to fight not only for their own rights, but for\r\nGod and their sovereign; and if the robber could feel encouraged in\r\nhis lawless pursuit after kneeling at the shrine of St Demas, surely\r\nthese heroes of a hundred fights were stronger for their religious\r\nfaith. Therefore it was with renewed confidence that the men buckled\r\ntighter their escaupiles, and pike in hand, their main reliance,\r\nthey resumed the march with quickened steps, leaving the baggage and\r\nhorses in the care of Marina and the carriers. The horsemen stationed\r\nin the field were not encountered, thanks to Duero who was one of them.\r\n\r\nIt was just past midnight, on the morning of whit-monday,[696] when\r\nthey entered Cempoala. Owing to the darkness and the presence of troops\r\nin the field, together with the recent marches and countermarches,\r\nthe presence of the intruders was not suspected till they had almost\r\ncrossed the plaza. The storm was not wholly past, but the moon\r\npeered forth at times between the chasing clouds, dimly revealing the\r\nbuildings occupied by the enemy. These consisted of three conspicuous\r\nedifices, rising upon pyramidal foundations, the ascent to which was\r\nby a wide staircase along one of the slopes. The highest was a temple,\r\nknown as Nuestra Señora since the iconoclastic achievement of Cortés\r\ntherein, and this was occupied by the troops of Diego Velazquez. Next\r\nto it was the building held by the captain-general, guarded by the\r\nwhole battery of guns.[697]\r\n\r\nHurtado had arrived nearly half an hour before and given warning,\r\nbut instead of immediately calling to arms, Narvaez lost time with\r\nquestions, which elicited only that his companion had been seized and\r\nthat he fancied he had heard Spanish voices. Some of the captains,\r\nfriendly to Cortés, ridiculed the story as a dream, and entertained\r\nthe general with speculations about the projects of the audacious\r\nrebel.[698] While so occupied the alarm of the sentinels was heard.\r\nCortés was upon them.[699] Narvaez at once became the self-possessed\r\ncommander, and hastened to issue the necessary orders. There was a\r\nrush to arms, and the confusion was increased by the appearance of\r\ninnumerable fire-flies, which the besieged mistook for the fire-arms\r\nand spears of a large army.[700]\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the range of the guns, Cortés had kept his men\r\nalong the sides of the approaches, and on finding himself discovered\r\nhe shouted, “Close with them! At them!” Fife and drum joined in\r\nand echoed the cry.[701] Olid rushed on the battery, ranged along\r\na terrace on the ascent to the commander’s house. So sudden was the\r\nattack that those of the artillerymen who still remained loyal had\r\ntime to discharge only one gun, which killed two men.[702] The next\r\ninstant Olid, Pizarro, and their followers had practically secured\r\nthe pieces, and were pressing the defenders, who offered little\r\nresistance. At the same time Sandoval rushed past and hurried up the\r\nstair-way to the summit, where Narvaez stood to receive him.[703] A\r\nvolley of arrows and bullets was fired at him, but being poorly aimed,\r\nout of consideration for comrades below, he escaped unharmed. Nothing\r\ndaunted, Sandoval’s followers pressed onward in a compact column, and\r\nin a moment they were on the summit platform. “Surrender!” shouted\r\ntheir leader with resolute confidence, to which Narvaez responded\r\nwith a jeer, calling on his men to spare no traitors. But the order\r\nwas an empty one, for their swords and short Spanish lances availed\r\nnothing against the line of bristling copper points on the long pikes\r\nof the attacking party, and step by step they were driven backward\r\ninto the building. What they did with their fire-arms or cross-bows\r\nis not stated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cortés was doing brave work below. One body engaged the\r\ncavalry, unhorsing with the all-effective pike those who had managed\r\nto reach the saddle, and cutting the girths. Another body turned their\r\nattention to the reinforcements which came rushing from the adjoining\r\nquarters to the scene of action, and taking advantage of the confusion\r\nand the darkness, relieved only at fitful intervals by the moon,\r\ntheir cool opponents readily disarmed the greater number, so that but\r\na small proportion made their way through the besieging lines.[704]\r\nWhile thus occupied they heard a shout from above, “Victory! Victory\r\nfor Cortés! Narvaez is dead!”[705] Cortés immediately caused the cry\r\nto be taken up by the rest of his men, which added to the confusion\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Sandoval, although reinforced by a portion of Olid’s\r\nparty, could not effect an entry into the building to which his pikes\r\nhad driven those who still adhered to Narvaez, a number having passed\r\nover to his side before this. After watching the vain skirmishing\r\nfor a while, Lopez, the ship-builder, bethought himself of setting\r\nfire to the dry palm roof of the otherwise substantial building.\r\nThe besieged now had no recourse but to come out, which they did,\r\nheaded by Narvaez. No sooner had they appeared on the platform than\r\nSandoval’s men charged them with the pikes, and the commander was the\r\nfirst to receive a thrust, in the left eye, which bore him down as he\r\ncried out: “Santa María, save me!” In an instant Pedro Sanchez Farfan\r\nwas upon him,[706] and he was dragged down the steps and placed in\r\na chapel. Awed by this mischance the rest speedily surrendered.\r\n\r\nAlférez Fuentes fought valiantly till overthrown with two pike\r\nthrusts. “Our Lady save me!” he cried, still clutching the standard.\r\n“She shall!” responded Sandoval, averting the pikes of the excited\r\nsoldiers.[707]\r\n\r\nThe cry of victory and the rumor of Narvaez’ death had stayed the\r\nstream of reinforcements from the adjoining houses, wherein defence\r\nwas now alone thought of. Recognizing that a charge on them might meet\r\nwith more determined opposition, Cortés resolved to bring the enemy’s\r\nown battery to his aid.[708] By the time the guns were in position,\r\nmost of the forces of Sandoval and Olid were free to aid Velazquez\r\nde Leon in the task of reducing the quarters in which Salvatierra\r\nand Diego Velazquez still held out.\r\n\r\nThey were summoned to submit to the king and to Cortés, under pain\r\nof death, but gave a defiant answer. The guns were now brought into\r\nplay, and fired first over their heads to frighten them. As the balls\r\ncame whizzing by, the blustering Salvatierra, who had sworn to eat\r\nthe ears of Cortés, declared himself sick. His fierceness changed to\r\nabject fear, and his men asserted that they never saw a captain behave\r\nso contemptibly. The shots, supported by promises, soon brought about\r\nthe surrender of this pyramid.\r\n\r\nThe last to hold out was Diego Velazquez, a brave fellow, well liked by\r\nhis followers; but after a few more parleys, and the loss of three men\r\nfrom well directed shots, his party was also prevailed on to descend\r\nand deliver up their arms,[709] the leaders being secured and removed\r\nin irons to the chapel, the wounded receiving there the attentions\r\nof a surgeon. Cortés looked in to examine their condition, and as\r\nthe whisper reached Narvaez that the hero of the day was present, he\r\nturned and said: “Señor Cortés, you may hold high the good fortune\r\nyou have had, and the great achievement of securing my person.” With\r\na twinkle of malicious merriment Cortés regarded for a moment his\r\nfallen foe, whose insufferable conceit did not desert him even here,\r\nand said: “Señor Narvaez, many deeds have I performed since coming\r\nto Mexico, but the least of them all has been to capture you.”[710]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [654] ‘Velazquez ... si yua en persona no podia escusar de\r\n     respetarle, aunque por su buena, y blãda condicion, confiaua\r\n     que le traeria a qualquier buen partido; pero temia que\r\n     yendo otro qualquier General.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     ix. cap. xix.\r\n\r\n     [655] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 144; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     ix. cap. xxi.; _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 90. ‘Afirman\r\n     muchos, que en essa saçon estaba tan bien quisto Cortés,\r\n     que si á todos los quisiera llevar, todos se fueran trás\r\n     él.’ _Oviedo_, iii. 509. Which is exaggerated, as we have\r\n     seen.\r\n\r\n     [656] ‘Debia ser alguna mala gente, y no vasallos de V.\r\n     A.,’ is Cortés’ version of the reply, _Cartas_, 119-20,\r\n     while his interpreter, Aguilar, gives it more literally as\r\n     ‘una gente vizcaynos e que no los enbiava el enperador.’\r\n     _Testimonio_, in _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 47, 184. Gomara\r\n     adds that Cortés said he was going to protect Montezuma’s\r\n     subjects, and to keep the strangers on the coast till he\r\n     was ready to depart. The emperor probably dissimulated,\r\n     ‘holgando que vnos Christianos a otros se matassen.’ _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 145. Forgetting that the declared purposes of Narvaez\r\n     were well known in Mexico, Herrera renders the answer that\r\n     this captain was a brother of Cortés, sent with a present\r\n     from their king. Both would come up to the capital and then\r\n     leave the country. The rumored enmity was due to an order\r\n     from Spain to avenge any injury suffered at the hands of\r\n     the natives, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. i. Brasseur de Bourbourg\r\n     follows him.\r\n\r\n     [657] ‘Aquellos españoles le dejaba encomendados con todo\r\n     aquel oro y joyas que él me habia dado ... y le dí muchas\r\n     joyas y ropas á él,’ et seq. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 119-20.\r\n     ‘Aun prometiò, que embiaria en nuestra ayuda cinco mil\r\n     hombres de guerra, e Cortes ... bien entendiò que no los\r\n     auia de embiar, e le dixo, que no auia menester.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 91; _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt.\r\n     iii. 135. Ixtlilxochitl assumes in one place that Cortés\r\n     asked for men, and was told that Aztecs dared not fight\r\n     Spaniards, but would go as carriers. In another version the\r\n     confederate kings grant the auxiliaries. _Hist. Chich._,\r\n     300; _Relaciones_, 389, 412. Solis assumes that Montezuma\r\n     is devoted to Cortés; so does Zamacois, who sees a proof\r\n     thereof in the offer of troops. He could not communicate\r\n     with Narvaez for want of interpreters, and had he wished to\r\n     aid the latter he would have attacked the Spanish quarters.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, ii. 70-1. All of which shows that this author\r\n     is not profound either in investigation or argument.\r\n\r\n     [658] Bernal Diaz places the force at 83 men, with 10\r\n     cross-bows, 14 firelocks, 4 large guns, falconets, 7\r\n     horses, and all the ammunition; 150 men were left, and 150\r\n     taken, _Oviedo_; a little over 50 were left, _Tapia_; all\r\n     wished to go, but 200 were left and 250 taken, including\r\n     the men of Velazquez, with 8 to 9 horses, and a force of\r\n     carriers, _Gomara_; 150 left, 250 taken, with a number of\r\n     Indians, _Ixtlilxochitl_; 150 left, _Probanza de Lejalde_.\r\n     B. V. de Tapia, who remained with Alvarado, says 130;\r\n     _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 36. Cortés’ own\r\n     account distributes the total of his force as follows:\r\n     140 left at Mexico, 150 absent under Velazquez, 70 taken\r\n     by himself, 150 at Villa Rica; but this is more than the\r\n     original number given on setting out for the plateau. The\r\n     Villa Rica force may, however, have been reduced by later\r\n     drafts, for other authorities allow only about 70 men for\r\n     this fortress. In the Ramusio edition of the _Cartas_ 140\r\n     men are given as the garrison left under Alvarado, while\r\n     60 are taken by Cortés, _Viaggi_, iii. 244, but later\r\n     issues place the former figure at 500, which is evidently\r\n     a misprint. However much the figures of different writers\r\n     may vary, it seems to be admitted that war and disease had\r\n     made a considerable inroad upon them.\r\n\r\n     [659] ‘Fizo capitan dellos a Alonzo Davila.’ _Monjaras and\r\n     Aguilar_, in _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 48, 184.\r\n\r\n     [660] ‘Que seria fasta catorze mill castellanos.’ _Monjaras_,\r\n     in _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 49. ‘Cinco o seys mill.’\r\n     _Tirado_, in _Id._, 7.\r\n\r\n     [661] ‘Porq̄ le pareciò q̄ auia conseguido su intento.’\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. i. Perhaps in spreading\r\n     the rumor that he came with Indian auxiliaries. Among the\r\n     auxiliaries were 400 men from Huexotzinco, under Pedro\r\n     Gonzalez de Trujillo. _Tirado_, and others, in _Cortés_,\r\n     _Residencia_, i. 247 et seq.; ii. 7 et seq. It is this\r\n     expedition of Rodriguez, assisted by Diego Garcia, Alonso\r\n     de Ojeda, and Juan Marquez, as captains, that has misled\r\n     Gomara, and particularly Herrera, in supposing that the\r\n     whole expedition received a grand reception at Tlascala;\r\n     but, beside the above reference, Cortés intimates clearly\r\n     enough that he did not go that way, and he certainly\r\n     did take a more southerly route to the coast than on the\r\n     previous journey. _Cartas_, 120. Bernal Diaz also says:\r\n     ‘embiò Cortes a Tlascala â rogar ... que nos embiassen de\r\n     presto quatro mil hombres.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 91. Prescott\r\n     falls not only into this generally adopted error, but states\r\n     that 600 troops were asked for, _Mex._, ii. 243, whilst the\r\n     chroniclers all say from 4000 to 10,000. ‘La maior parte de\r\n     ellos se bolviò, porque aquella Nacion no estaba acostumbrada\r\n     à pelear fuera de su Tierra.’ _Torquemada_, i. 482. A not\r\n     very sound excuse, since their troops had already gone to\r\n     Mexico.\r\n\r\n     [662] About twenty leagues east of Cholula.\r\n\r\n     [663] ‘Vezino de la Puebla, que era ballestero.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 90.\r\n\r\n     [664] ‘Púsole preso en su pié de amigo.’ _Demanda de\r\n     Ceballos_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 441. But this\r\n     is not likely. Bernal Diaz says that Narvaez was told to\r\n     send communications to Tampaniquita. _Hist. Verdad._, 91;\r\n     _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. 248, ii. 185.\r\n\r\n     [665] Torquemada and Clavigero attempt to correct this\r\n     spelling, but Bernal Diaz is sustained by Orozco y Berra, in\r\n     _Mex._, _Noticias Ciudad_, 244-6. Bernal Diaz also mentions\r\n     Mitalaguita, which may be Metlangutla, a few leagues farther\r\n     east. _Hist. Verdad._, 91. Herrera states that they passed\r\n     through Cotastlan, by which he means probably the province,\r\n     and not the town, of Cuetlachtlan. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. i.\r\n\r\n     [666] Herrera, ubi sup., leaves Ircio in command at Villa\r\n     Rica, which is improbable. Sandoval arrived at the rendezvous\r\n     the day after us. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 92;\r\n     _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 3-9. Prescott makes him join\r\n     long before this, on the high plateau, but he misunderstands\r\n     his authorities, and is quite at sea with respect to the\r\n     route followed by the forces.\r\n\r\n     [667] Bernal Diaz and Herrera say 266 in all; Torquemada\r\n     has 266, beside captains and five horsemen; Cortés, 250 in\r\n     all; Tapia, about 250.\r\n\r\n     [668] ‘Por vn peto, ó capacete, ó casco, ó babera de hierro,\r\n     dieramos aquella noche quãto nos pidierã por ello.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 98.\r\n\r\n     [669] Thirty-eight palmos long. _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     x. cap. iii.\r\n\r\n     [670] According to Bernal Diaz this commission was arranged\r\n     by the combined influence of Olmedo and Duero, during\r\n     Olmedo’s second visit to the camp. The friar appears,\r\n     however, to have been there but once, when he was expelled.\r\n     Knowing Salvatierra to be a blusterer, Bermudez, the alguacil\r\n     mayor, proposed that he should join the commission, but\r\n     his intended victim, not caring to trust himself within\r\n     the power of Cortés, pleaded sickness and a dislike to\r\n     speak with a traitor. ‘Señor Veedor,’ chimed in Olmedo,\r\n     ironically, ‘best it is to be prudent, and you may have\r\n     him prisoner before long.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 93.\r\n\r\n     [671] Duero was to receive the share of treasures claimed,\r\n     a command in the expedition equal to that of Cortés, and\r\n     after the conquest a grant of towns similar to his own.\r\n     As a further inducement, sufficient gold was given to load\r\n     his two Cuban servants. On taking leave of the general, on\r\n     pentecost morning, Duero asked: ‘What has your worship to\r\n     say, before I leave?’ ‘God be with you,’ was the reply, ‘and\r\n     see to it, Señor Duero, that it be done as arranged, or by\r\n     my conscience [Cortés’ favorite oath] I’ll be in your camp\r\n     within three days, with all my companions, and the first\r\n     to receive the lance will be your worship, if I see aught\r\n     contrary.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 94. Monjaras\r\n     states that Duero and Leon warned Cortés against opposing\r\n     Narvaez’ army and commission. _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii.\r\n     49.\r\n\r\n     [672] Cortés to remain governor of the part to be allotted\r\n     him till the king should decide. _Tapia_, _Rel._, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 588. According to Gomara,\r\n     who sends Veedor Álvarez Chico, Juan Velazquez, and Juan\r\n     del Rio, to carry the message, Cortés proposed a private\r\n     interview for the discussion of two points, whether Narvaez\r\n     would leave Mexico to him and go to Pánuco or elsewhere,\r\n     aided by Cortés with gold and supplies, or whether Narvaez\r\n     preferred to take Mexico and give him 300 or 400 men\r\n     wherewith to pass on to new conquests. _Hist. Mex._, 144.\r\n     The last proposal could only have been a trap to secure\r\n     Narvaez’ men. Prescott chooses to omit the proposal for\r\n     an interview, and sends instead the ultimatum with Duero,\r\n     a glaring disregard of Cortés’ own text, as confirmed by\r\n     others. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 121-2; _Oviedo_, iii. 314.\r\n\r\n     [673] ‘Dize Narvaez, y en todo su Real ay fama, qui si\r\n     U. merced [Velazquez] vá allâ, que luego yo [Cortés] soy\r\n     deshecho.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 95.\r\n\r\n     [674] Bernal Diaz states that Cortés made the request in\r\n     a manner that appeared to Velazquez an attempt to probe\r\n     his loyalty. He therefore refused to take any valuables\r\n     with him, but was finally persuaded. Juan del Rio, Cortés’\r\n     equerry, kept him company.\r\n\r\n     [675] Bernal Diaz adds that, these efforts being observed\r\n     by Salvatierra, Narvaez was urged to seize Velazquez, and\r\n     this would have been done but for the representations of\r\n     Duero and others. During the dinner given in his honor,\r\n     Captain Diego Velazquez, nephew of the Cuban governor,\r\n     alluded in one of his remarks to Cortés as a traitor. The\r\n     guest appealed to Narvaez against such expressions. Diego\r\n     repeated the term, and added that Juan did not deserve to\r\n     bear the name Velazquez. Grasping his sword the latter\r\n     retorted, calling him a liar. He would prove himself a\r\n     better man than either uncle or nephew, if permission\r\n     was granted. The others had to interfere to prevent the\r\n     clashing of swords, and Narvaez was persuaded to order the\r\n     turbulent visitor away. At leave-taking the general showed\r\n     his annoyance, and said that it would have been better had\r\n     he not come. Diego Velazquez, who stood by his side, added\r\n     a threat, to which Juan rashly retorted, with a twirl of\r\n     his beard: ‘Before many days I shall see if your prowess\r\n     equals your boast.’ Alarmed at his want of self-control,\r\n     Duero and other sympathizers hurried him away before he\r\n     could utter any more indiscretions. He and the equerry had\r\n     hardly left camp before some horsemen appeared, as if in\r\n     pursuit, and caused them to increase their pace. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 95-6; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. i.\r\n\r\n     [676] _Cartas_, 122. Bernal Diaz assumes that the proposal\r\n     for an interview came from Narvaez, through Duero, to\r\n     whom he also confided the intended treachery. Olmedo, who\r\n     had pretended to be won over, was also informed. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 93. Herrera supposes that Sandoval warns Cortés,\r\n     who, according to Gomara, is still at Mexico when the\r\n     proposal comes. _Hist. Mex._, 144. Solis is more correct\r\n     in ascribing the warning to Duero. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 83.\r\n\r\n     [677] The fact that he allowed such dangerous men as\r\n     Velazquez de Leon and Olmedo to go free indicates that he\r\n     harbored no treachery.\r\n\r\n     [678] Gomara sends them with Velazquez de Leon. _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     144. ‘Chico, é Pedro Hernandez, escribano.’ _Demanda de\r\n     Ceballos_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 440. Velazquez\r\n     having gone on a mediatory mission, Chico must have been\r\n     sent after his departure.\r\n\r\n     [679] ‘La respuesta ... fué prender al escribano y á la\r\n     persona que con mi poder ... los cuales estuvieron detenidos\r\n     hasta que llegó otro mensajero que yo envié.’ ‘Escribí una\r\n     carta al dicho Narvaez y otra á los terceros, diciéndoles\r\n     cómo yo habia sabido su mala intencion.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     122-3. The reference to a messenger indicates Cortés’\r\n     meaning to be that Chico preceded Velazquez de Leon. Gomara\r\n     assumes that Cortés’ pretext for withdrawing the proposal\r\n     for an interview was that Narvaez had declined to entertain\r\n     the points to be there discussed. See note 19. Chico had\r\n     warned him of the intended treachery. _Hist. Mex._, 144.\r\n     ‘Y que supiesse que no auian de cantar dos gallos en vn\r\n     muladar, y que aparejasse las manos.’ _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. ix. cap. xxi. Bernal Diaz sends the message with\r\n     Olmedo, ‘since no royal notary dare carry it,’ and gives\r\n     Narvaez three days in which to send in any commission he\r\n     may possess signed by the king. Without such commission he\r\n     must leave the country, or Cortés will seize him and inflict\r\n     punishment for the outrage on Aillon and on the Indians.\r\n     This ultimatum was signed also by the captains and some\r\n     soldiers, including Bernal Diaz. _Hist. Verdad._, 92-3. An\r\n     answer was demanded through the same messengers. _Tapia_,\r\n     _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.

On\r\n     the way to Rio de Canoas, where they arrived the day after\r\n     leaving camp, two hogs, with navel on the back, were killed,\r\n     an incident which many interpreted as a sign of victory.\r\n     Velazquez having arrived with the messenger who carried\r\n     the ultimatum, the army proceeded. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 95. ‘Anduvimos aquel dia casi diez leguas.’\r\n     _Tapia_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.

Verdad._, 98; _Tapia_,\r\n     _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 590.\r\n\r\n     [688] Herrera writes 3000, 1500, and 1000 pesos de oro.\r\n     Cortés’ acts are said by the men of Velazquez to have been\r\n     prompted by ‘un diabólico pensamiento é infernal osadía.’\r\n     _Demanda de Ceballos_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 441.\r\n\r\n     [689] The above agrees chiefly with Herrera, who assigns\r\n     Sandoval 60 men, and names a number of the leading members\r\n     of each party. The parties were to keep a stone’s throw\r\n     apart. One of Cortés’ squads was to look to the cacique’s\r\n     palace, and another to Alcalde Yuste’s quarters. dec. ii.\r\n     lib. x. cap. iii. He is evidently confused on many points,\r\n     and several names are guessed at. Bernal Diaz states\r\n     that Pizarro, with 60 young men, including himself, was\r\n     charged to capture the artillery; Sandoval received 60 men;\r\n     Velazquez de Leon also a force of 60, wherewith to attack\r\n     Diego Velazquez’ quarters; Cortés remained with a reserve\r\n     of 20. It is more likely that a higher officer, like Olid,\r\n     received the order to capture the artillery, rather than the\r\n     comparatively unknown Pizarro. Velazquez de Leon does not\r\n     appear to have been detailed for his charge till afterward.\r\n     Cortés names only Sandoval as the leader of one party of 80\r\n     men, he himself following with the remaining 170. _Cartas_,\r\n     123. Solis reverses Herrera’s order. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 91-2.\r\n\r\n     [690] The stout cacique had remonstrated with the general\r\n     on his carelessness, assuring him that Malinche with his\r\n     Teules was far different. ‘When you least expect it he\r\n     will be here and will kill you.’ Although the warning was\r\n     received with laughter, yet the hint was not lost. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 96.\r\n\r\n     [691] Eighty horsemen and 500 infantry. ‘Y llegó casi una\r\n     legua de donde yo estaba.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 123.\r\n\r\n     [692] _Laet_, _Nov.

After obtaining certain information, more was\r\n     demanded. The prisoner declared that he knew nothing more.\r\n     ‘Well, then, you will swing,’ said Cortés, half jestingly.\r\n     The two pikemen who held the rope round his neck took this\r\n     for a command, and hoisted him. Rangel rode up, however,\r\n     and saved his life, but the compression of the throat\r\n     troubled him for some time. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. ii.-iii.\r\n     Carrasco warned him against attacking the powerful Narvaez.\r\n     _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Ecles._, pt. iii. 137; _Tapia_, _Rel._,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.

Prescott says that\r\n     he with ‘Spartan heroism’ remained silent, _Mex._, 257-8;\r\n     but Prescott has evidently not understood his authorities.\r\n\r\n     [695] At a cross-road a little farther on, says Herrera.\r\n\r\n     [696] May 28th. _Chimalpain_, _Hist.

Verdad._, 99, calls the flies\r\n     cocayos.\r\n\r\n     [701] Prescott, following Herrera, makes Cortés shout the\r\n     password ‘Espíritu Santo,’ which Bernal Diaz says was given\r\n     as a secret word for mutual recognition.\r\n\r\n     [702] So say all the original authorities that refer to it,\r\n     except Bernal Diaz, who claims that four guns were fired,\r\n     three balls passing overhead and the fourth killing three\r\n     men. Cortés acknowledges no casualties from it. Tapia even\r\n     intimates that no discharge took place, owing to the fact\r\n     that to protect the touch-holes from rain they had been\r\n     covered with wax and tiles. Confused by the sudden alarm\r\n     the artillerists applied the match, forgetful of the wax,\r\n     and ‘we saw that the charges failed to go off.’ _Rel._, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 590. Perhaps he would have\r\n     been more correct in saying that the men were confused by the\r\n     glittering bribes of Usagre. Bachiller A. Perez testifies:\r\n     ‘Dixo al artillero poned fuego a estos tiros ... puso fuego\r\n     e no salieron los tiros e oyo dezir este testigo que avian\r\n     puesto cera en los dichos tiros.’ _Cortés_, _Residencia_,\r\n     ii. 85. This implies that the wax had been smeared on by\r\n     accomplices.\r\n\r\n     [703] With from 40 to 100 men, are the different estimates.\r\n\r\n     [704] ‘Vinien los contrarios á nuestra gente, creyendo que\r\n     eran de los suyos, á preguntar, “¿qué es esto?” é así los\r\n     prendien.’ _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._,\r\n     ii. 590. ‘De las otras dos torres ... no le acudierõ,\r\n     porq̄ dizen algunos que se hizieron sordos, otros que\r\n     no pudieron llegar, por el impedimento de las tropas de\r\n     Cortes.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. iii.; _Cardona_,\r\n     in _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. 181-2.\r\n\r\n     [705] ‘Uitoria, vitoria por los del nõbre del Espíritu Sãto,\r\n     q muerto es Narvaez!’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 98.\r\n     Even this authority now shouts forth the password!\r\n\r\n     [706] Solis assumes that Farfan gave also the thrust. Bernal\r\n     Diaz’ text leads one to suppose that Narvaez received the\r\n     thrust before his followers were driven into the building,\r\n     but the other authorities state clearly: ‘al salir de su\r\n     camara, le dieron vn picaço.... Echaronle luego mano.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 147; _Oviedo_, iii. 510. Monjaras\r\n     states that Narvaez supplicated for his life: ‘Hidalgos,\r\n     por amor de Dios no me mateys!’ _Testimonio_, in _Cortés_,\r\n     _Residencia_, ii. 51, 85, 107; i. 365. ‘Alonso Dávila le\r\n     sacó dichas provisiones reales de V. M. del seno, teniéndolo\r\n     preso é abrazado el dicho Pero Sanchez Farfán.’ _Demanda\r\n     de Ceballos_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 442. This\r\n     occurred some time after the capture. Narvaez called upon\r\n     his fellow-prisoners to witness the deed, but Ávila shouted\r\n     that the papers were merely letters. They were given to\r\n     Cortés. ‘Las avian quemado.’ _Testimonio_, in _Cortés_,\r\n     _Residencia_, i. 345, 365, 250; ii. 52, 187.\r\n\r\n     [707] He died, however, says Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     99. Herrera calls him Diego de Rojas, whom Bernal classes\r\n     as a captain.\r\n\r\n     [708] ‘Se retrajeron á una torre alta de un ídolo de aquel\r\n     pueblo casi cuatrocientos hombres, é muchos de los de caballo\r\n     ... salieron al campo.’ _Tapia_, _Rel._, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, 590. Herrera says that 300 intrenched themselves\r\n     till the morning. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. iv. Cortés reached\r\n     the battery just in time to prevent a catastrophe, as\r\n     Tapia relates. A hot-blooded young companion of the latter,\r\n     carried away by excitement, rushed to powder barrels, eight\r\n     in number, and shouted, ‘Let us fire the powder and spoil\r\n     it for the enemy!’ Cleaving a barrel, he cast a brand into\r\n     it, and threw himself flat upon the ground, commending his\r\n     life to God. It happened, fortunately, that this barrel\r\n     contained sandals, which by some mistake had been mixed\r\n     up with the ammunition. After waiting in vain a while for\r\n     the explosion, the madcap discovered the reason and began\r\n     to open another barrel. At this moment Cortés came up, and\r\n     learning of his intention he rushed forward and snatched\r\n     away the brand.\r\n\r\n     [709] Including also Juan Yuste, Juan Bono, and Gomara.\r\n\r\n     [710] _Oviedo_, iii. 510. Bernal Diaz lengthens Cortés’\r\n     reply: He thanked God for the victory and for giving him\r\n     such valiant gentlemen and companions to aid him. One of\r\n     the smallest things he had done in New Spain was to secure\r\n     and defeat him; it appeared more daring to seize an oidor\r\n     of his majesty. Las Casas relates that Narvaez had a not\r\n     dissimilar surprise by night from Cuban Indians, during\r\n     his campaign for Velazquez, and had a narrow escape. _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, iv. 6-8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nALVARADO’S MERCILESS MASSACRE.\r\n\r\nMAY, 1520.\r\n\r\n     AFTER THE BATTLE—VICTORY MADE SECURE—CONDUCT OF THE\r\n     CONQUERED—A GENERAL AMNESTY—DISPOSITION OF THE FORCES—AFFAIRS\r\n     AT THE CAPITAL—INSURRECTION THREATENED—THE SPANIARDS HOLD A\r\n     COUNCIL—ALVARADO’S RESOLVE—THE GREAT DAY OF THE FEAST—THE\r\n     SPANIARDS PROCEED TO THE TEMPLE—THE GRAND DISPLAY THERE\r\n     WITNESSED—THE ATTACK OF THE SPANIARDS—HORRORS UPON HORRORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCortés was exultant. During the last brief hour how completely had\r\nhis fortunes changed! Again was his star ascendant, filling the whole\r\nheavens with its brightness. Alas now for Montezuma and Mexico! And\r\nVelazquez; this was his fourth attempt on Mexico, and in some respects\r\nhis greatest failure. Instead of annihilating the outlaw with his\r\ngrand army, the outlaw in one fell swoop had secured the grand army,\r\nand was now master of all the ships, and men, and munitions of war,\r\nwhich he so much needed in consummation of his further designs. It\r\nseemed to be the fate of the fat governor out of his solid substance\r\nto feed his enemy with wealth and honors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore it was fairly light Cortés had seized and placed in confinement\r\nsuch persons as might question his rights as victor; the remainder on\r\nsurrendering their arms were permitted to go at large.[711] In order\r\nto make more secure his magnificent prize before the all-searching\r\nsun should disclose the paucity and poverty of the victors, Cortés\r\nseated himself in state, arrayed in a wide orange-colored robe, and\r\nordered the conquered troops to pass before him, and swear allegiance\r\nto the king, and fealty to him as captain-general and justicia mayor.\r\nThis was done by nearly all, some humbling themselves and kissing\r\nhis hand, while the late hostile leaders and old acquaintances were\r\nrecognized with friendly greetings and embraces.[712]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Olid and Ordaz, each with a corps, set out on the captured\r\nhorses to summon stragglers and seek the forty troopers in the field.\r\nDuero and other friends of Cortés being among them, little persuasion\r\nwas needed to win the party over, and shortly after dawn the whole\r\ncavalcade came in to the sound of fife and drum, shouting vivas\r\nfor Cortés.[713] High above this noise were heard from a window the\r\nvoices of two women, named Ordaz, filling the air with their loud\r\nphilippics. “Villainous Dominicanos!” they cried to the soldiers of\r\ntheir own party, “the distaff would better suit you than the sword.\r\nA good account have you given of yourselves! Unfortunate women we\r\nto have come to the wars with such men!” Truly might Narvaez exclaim\r\nwith Xerxes, as he beheld his fair ally, Queen Artemisia, outwit her\r\nAthenian pursuers, “My men fight like women, and my women like men.”\r\nThe Ordaz women, however, fought only with their tongues, and that\r\nafter the issue of battle. And thus relieved they immediately descended\r\nand did homage to the victor. The general did all he could to check\r\nthis excess of zeal, which he feared might engender ill feeling, and\r\nhe even seized some of the noisiest enthusiasts, although they were\r\nafterward rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe cacique of Cempoala, who had been slightly wounded during the\r\nbattle, appeared like the rest to offer fealty to the victor by\r\ncrowning him with flowers. Cortés received his demonstrations as if\r\nnothing had taken place to mar their intercourse, and took up his\r\nabode with Catalina, whose hand he had accepted during his previous\r\noccupation of the place. The chiefs vied with one another to obliterate\r\ntheir unfortunate mistake by increased attention and hospitality,\r\nwhile many among Narvaez’ men thought it necessary to excuse their\r\ntardy surrender by pleading that they had been deceived by their\r\nprincipals, who had assured them that Cortés was a traitor. Great\r\nwas their chagrin in the morning on discovering how few the victors\r\nwere and how poorly they were armed. And where were the much talked\r\nof native auxiliaries? At the same time they could not but admire\r\na leader who had achieved such results with such means. Narvaez and\r\nhis supporters declared that the victory was due wholly to treachery,\r\nparticularly noticeable in the action of the artillerists.[714] In\r\nthis there was much truth, but the consummate tact and soldierly\r\nqualities of Cortés shine no less brightly for all that. And the\r\ncost of this glory and advantage, how insignificant it was! Four of\r\nhis own men and fifteen of the enemy, including a captain, beside a\r\nnumber wounded on both sides; this was all.[715]\r\n\r\nIn his report to the king Cortés seeks to gloss over the occurrence\r\nby stating that only two men were killed, intimating that it was on\r\nboth sides. There was a deeper reason for this and other falsehoods\r\nthan the wish to hide the bloody result of fratricidal conflict. He\r\nwas still doubtful as to the view taken in Spain of his conduct, and\r\ncould not afford to prejudice his case by laying bare every misfortune.\r\nHe was aware that even to the impartial observer he must appear as a\r\ndefaulter in the duty owing by him to a principal, and in the agreement\r\nor partnership which he had formed, and also as the usurper of an\r\nexpedition fitted out in the name and under the auspices, at least,\r\nof Velazquez. His plea rested on his brave and masterly conquest of a\r\nrich country, and on his election to independent command by a party\r\nformed on the pretence that the superior interests of the sovereign\r\ndemanded the immediate subjugation of the country. But his acceptance\r\nof that command was a breach of duty and of contract; the right of\r\nthe party to act as it did was doubtful, and its pretence hasty, or\r\nperhaps usurped from Velazquez, who had first entertained it; while\r\nthe commission to undertake the conquest had already been conferred on\r\nthe latter. Velazquez held besides the right of a discoverer to this\r\ncoast, and above all the royal grant to it, vaguely worded though it\r\nwas so far as indicating the situation and extent of territory. He\r\nhad a right to claim his own; though circumstances had so changed,\r\nCortés claimed, as to render this perilous to the interests of God,\r\nthe king, and the people, which rose above those of individuals; and\r\nin ignoring the orders of the audiencia to desist from war on his\r\ncountrymen he followed only natural law and justifiable impulse.\r\nIn this respect Cortés was equally guilty, since his duty was to\r\nyield to the rightful claimant. He pleads in his letter to the king,\r\nhowever, that self-preservation obliged him to resist, for Narvaez had\r\ndetermined to hang him and several of his followers. Here he again\r\nhides the fact that favorable terms were at one time offered. “Had\r\nNarvaez carried off the victory,” he continues, “it would have been\r\nwith a great loss, which must have so weakened him as to surely enable\r\nthe Indians to succeed in their meditated revolt. This would have\r\nlost the country to the king and to the faith, and twenty years would\r\nnot have sufficed to regain it.”[716] In brief, howsoever we admire\r\nCortés, however much we would prefer his banner to that of Velazquez\r\nor Narvaez, we must admit that he had hardly a shadow of right on his\r\nside, and that no position in which he could possibly place himself\r\nwas tenable. He was a defaulter, pirate, usurper, renegade, traitor,\r\noutlaw, hypocrite; but he was a most lovable villain, an admirable\r\nsoldier, a rare hero. On the other hand, Velazquez was right. But,\r\nthough deeply injured, he was disagreeable; though foully wronged,\r\nhe was vanquished. And the Spanish monarch was not the first or last\r\nto smile on iniquitous success, or turn the cold shoulder to whining,\r\ndisappointed virtue.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the morning the soldier Barrientos, who had been\r\nstaying in Chinantla, arrived with the promised Chinantec warriors,\r\ntwo thousand in number.[717] They had reached the rendezvous on\r\npentecost day, as ordered, but Cortés had found it convenient to\r\nadvance on Cempoala sooner than he had intended. An imposing sight\r\nthey presented as they marched by amidst vivas in a file of three\r\nabreast, gorgeous with plumes and shields, the centre man with bow and\r\narrows, while his companions on either side carried the formidable\r\npike, tipped with glistening iztli. It was fortunate that they had\r\nfailed to arrive in time, since much bloodshed was saved thereby. In\r\nfact the soldiers of Narvaez expressed a fear that they would have\r\nfared badly with such opponents. Cortés was nevertheless delighted\r\nwith their coming, since this proved not only the sincerity of their\r\nfriendship, but showed the conquered that he did indeed control native\r\narmies. Distributing some beads and trinkets, he bade them return\r\npeaceably under the supervising care of Barrientos.\r\n\r\nOne of the first measures after the fight was to secure the fleet;\r\nand for this purpose a suitable force was sent down to the port to\r\ntake the vessels to Villa Rica, and remove the sails and rudders, so\r\nas to prevent the escape of any to Cuba.[718] Shortly after, when the\r\nmasters and crews had tendered allegiance, the vessels were placed\r\nin charge of Pedro Caballero, captain of one of the vessels under\r\nNarvaez, in whom Cortés had great confidence.[719] The fortress was\r\nagain garrisoned, with a larger force,[720] and thither were sent\r\nNarvaez and Salvatierra in chains.[721]\r\n\r\nAs for the rest, Cortés applied himself with his usual skill to\r\nrecompense those who had remained true, and to conciliate the yet\r\nunreconciled. He reminded them that they had come not to risk their\r\nlives for Velazquez, but to gain honor and wealth under the banner of\r\nthe king, and he was prepared to aid in this by offering them equal\r\nterms with his veterans. As an earnest he restored within two days\r\ntheir arms to all except a few leaders, and ordered his men to return\r\nthe horses, weapons, and other effects taken by them as spoils of\r\nwar.[722] What with their admiration of the liberality and soldierly\r\nqualities of Cortés, and the prospect of speedy advancement, there\r\nwere but few who did not immediately and cheerfully accept the terms.\r\nBut this was by no means to the taste of the aforesaid veterans. They\r\nhad seen with envy that rich presents were made to the conquered,\r\nwhile they, whose courage and devotion had achieved such magnificent\r\nresults, received nothing, and were even told to return what they\r\nregarded as lawful spoils; and, further, to share with these late\r\ncomers and intended despoilers the fruits of their years of toil\r\nand victories. A general murmur arose, and many soldiers refused to\r\nsurrender the appropriated effects. Captain Ávila and Father Olmedo\r\nbeing requested to remonstrate, did so earnestly, and told Cortés\r\nthat he acted like Alexander, who honored more the conquered than\r\nthose who won the battle. He and all he possessed belonged to his\r\ncomrades, was the reply, but at present it was necessary to conciliate\r\ntheir invaluable acquisition, whose aid was needed to overcome the\r\nthreatening danger in Mexico, and who being the more numerous party\r\nmight otherwise rise against them. Their aims effected, the entire\r\nresources of a vast and rich country were theirs. Olmedo was convinced\r\nof the wisdom of the course, although he considered that too great\r\nliberality had been shown. The headstrong Ávila pressed the point with\r\nhis natural haughtiness, whereupon Cortés said: “I am for Mexico;\r\nthose who please may follow; those who do not, may leave it alone.\r\nThere are yet women in Spain to bear soldiers.” “Yes, and captains\r\nand governors,” retorted Ávila. Cortés deemed it discreet to bandy\r\nno further words at present. So spirited a tongue must be curbed with\r\ngifts; but Cortés awaited his opportunity. He never forgot anything.\r\n\r\nWith a view chiefly to divert the troubled spirits two expeditions\r\nwere sent out, each of two hundred men, mostly from the ranks of the\r\nlate enemy. One was directed to Goazacoalco, as before, under the\r\ncommand of Velazquez de Leon, who had already held this commission,\r\nand two vessels were placed at his disposal to send to Jamaica for\r\nlive-stock, seeds, and other requirements of the proposed colony.\r\nThe other expedition was intrusted to Ordaz for the occupation of\r\nPánuco, with a view to anticipate Garay. Two vessels were given him\r\nto explore the coast.[723]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Cortés was thus risking all on the cast of fortune at Cempoala\r\nthe troops at Mexico had been exposed to even greater perils. At the\r\ntime of his departure for the coast, Toxcatl, the fifth month, had\r\nbegun, and with it the most solemn festival of the year. It was in\r\nhonor of Tezcatlipoca, the highest of the divinities, and identified\r\nwith a supreme god, although less conspicuous in the daily worship\r\nof the people, for they appealed rather to the nearer minor deities,\r\nwhom they regarded as intercessors, than to their supreme divinity,\r\nwhom they greatly feared, and who was very far away. The Mexicans\r\nhad been permitted to hold the celebration in the great temple,\r\nwhich had been partly dedicated to Christian worship, on condition\r\nthat no human sacrifices should take place.[724] A festival of this\r\nprominence could not fail to recall with all its force to the natives\r\nthe indignities to which they and their gods had been subjected. We\r\nhave seen how narrowly an uprising on account of the occupation of\r\nthe great temple by strange religious emblems was escaped, and how\r\nit was restrained only by the promise of the speedy departure of the\r\nSpaniards. Before Cortés had left the capital he saw the smouldering\r\nfire, and it was this that led him to strengthen the defences of\r\nthe fort, to obtain extra supplies from Tlascala, and to enjoin the\r\nstrictest watchfulness and moderation.\r\n\r\nThe hostile feeling was by no means diminished by the tidings of\r\nanother larger host of invaders with doubtful motives. At a meeting\r\nof native leaders it was admitted that the promises and statements of\r\nthe newly arrived Spaniards could no more be relied upon than those\r\nof the deceitful Malinche, and the deferred proposition to drive out\r\nor to kill the Spaniards was renewed with ardor. A better opportunity\r\nfor carrying out such a measure could never again be found. The\r\ngreat Cortés with his cunning controlling mind was absent. There\r\nremained only a small force in charge of the city, and the troops\r\non the seaboard were divided against each other. On the other hand\r\na multitude of pilgrims were pouring in for the festival; and what\r\nbetter subjects to be worked upon for an uprising than these, and\r\nwhat better incentive than religion? Beside the appeal for vengeance\r\non the desecrators of their altars came the patriotic call for the\r\nrelease of an oppressed sovereign, whose influence was still supreme\r\nwith many, and the alluring prospect of securing the rich spoils in\r\npossession of the Spaniards and the Tlascaltecs, the latter still\r\nmore detested as an inferior race which after years of contest had\r\nnow assumed the galling attitude of master. The preparations made\r\nduring the late fermentation required only to be perfected. More arms\r\nwere made, the people were stirred by passionate appeals, warriors\r\nwere enrolled, and other measures taken.[725]\r\n\r\nThe utmost secrecy had been observed by the conspirators, but with\r\nso many confidants, actuated by race jealousy, by ties of friendship,\r\nby interest, and by one above all others, the love of woman, that the\r\nrumor was whispered in Alvarado’s ear.[726] Yet to the mistress, who\r\nin her devotion to the lover forgot her duty to home and kindred, must\r\nnot be charged more than is her due. Sharpened by the remembrance\r\nof past wrongs suffered on battle-field and stone of sacrifice,\r\nthe wits of the Tlascaltecs discovered evidence which their hatred\r\nfailed not to magnify. Warnings were hardly required, however, to\r\nindicate that something unusual was stirring, for the demeanor of the\r\nIndians had undergone a yet more marked change. Supplies were further\r\ndiminished; servants sent to market were abused and ill-treated, and\r\ninsolence was shown even to the Spaniards themselves.[727] A still\r\nmore alarming sign was the discovery of an undermined wall,[728]\r\nand after obtaining further particulars from a devoted Tezcucan\r\nchief,[729] afterward known as Don Hernando, Alvarado resolved to\r\ninspect the adjacent temple where the chief celebration was held.\r\nHere a number of suspicious circumstances were noticed, which the\r\nCastilians readily wrought into threatening realities; among them\r\nseveral victims destined for sacrifice, regardless of the promises\r\ngiven, while some bloody hearts which they saw testified to the work\r\nalready done by the knife.[730] With the victims Alvarado seized\r\ntheir attendants and certain of the emperor’s courtiers, from some\r\nof whom he tortured a confession. In this manner he learned what he\r\nalready partially knew, namely, that many arms were prepared; that\r\nduring the Incensing of Huitzilopochtli, as the festival was called,\r\nthe Christian emblems would be cast out of the temple, and that the\r\nuprising was to take place at the conclusion of the feast.[731]\r\n\r\nA seeming confirmation of the proposed sacrilege came from Montezuma\r\nhimself, who sent to request the removal of the Christian emblems\r\nfrom the summit of the great temple, pleading as high-priest that the\r\npresence of strange images must prove irritating to the worshippers\r\nof other gods. Alvarado indignantly refused; he would rather fight.\r\nThe Mexicans did not choose to see their festival broken up before\r\nthe appointed time, and so the point was waived. It was then arranged\r\nthat the Spaniards should attend the ceremonies, so as to be assured\r\nthat no indignities would be offered their images.[732]\r\n\r\nAnd now comes another of those diabolical deeds which, done in the\r\nname of civilization, or religion, or any other entity or idea,\r\nfills us with horror toward the gods and men for whom or by whom such\r\nacts are consummated. The lion and the tiger are humane and gentle\r\nbeside the Spaniard, harboring thoughts born of bigoted zeal or blind\r\napprehension. And what are his thoughts? These: He would enter the\r\nsanctuary, the holy temple of his god and their gods, and while all\r\nthe people, while priests and nobles, the flower of the Aztec race,\r\nwere celebrating the highest service of the highest festival, he\r\nand his men would fall upon them and hew them in pieces! And this\r\nbecause they had tired of harboring and feeding them. They desire to\r\nbe relieved of the self-invited guests, and since dismissal does not\r\navail they must be driven out or killed. But the intruders do not\r\nwish to be exterminated, and if there is striking to be done, they\r\npropose to strike first.\r\n\r\nPedro de Alvarado was no such man as Hernan Cortés. He was scarcely\r\nfit to be his servant. There were a dozen prominent qualities that\r\ncombined to make up the great man in Cortés which were absent in\r\nAlvarado. Both of them were loyal, brave, and merciless, but there\r\nwas a method in the excesses of Cortés which those of Alvarado lacked.\r\nCortés was deep, Alvarado shallow; Cortés was patient under affront,\r\nAlvarado was violent; Cortés was cool in time of danger, Alvarado\r\nwas excited—and so on. And yet Alvarado was a gallant cavalier.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards now held a council, before which Alvarado placed the\r\ninformation thus far obtained of the plot, and the necessity of prompt\r\nmeasures was at once recognized. They did not believe Montezuma to\r\nbe taking any active part in the conspiracy, but that swayed by hopes\r\nand fears he was allowing himself, with his usual want of resolution,\r\nto yield to the stronger will of his courtiers a passive consent to\r\nthe efforts for his release.[733]\r\n\r\nLess prudent than his chief, and less fertile in resources, Alvarado\r\ndid not look for preventives to check the conspiracy, but to what he\r\nregarded as a decisive blow to crush it, such as that administered\r\nat Cholula. He had not the foresight of his general with regard to\r\nthe proper adjustment of means to ends, nor his magic influence over\r\nthose around him, friend or foe. He remembered only the good effect\r\nof the massacre on the effeminate Cholultecs, and felt convinced that\r\nso excellent a measure must answer also for the apparently abject\r\nAztecs. It thoroughly suited his rash daring and cruel disposition.\r\nTo attack is to win, was his maxim. The difference in circumstances\r\nhardly entered into consideration, chief among which was the smaller\r\nforce, unsupported by the neutrality of half the city, as at Cholula,\r\nand without allies close at hand. The gathering of so many nobles and\r\nmilitary leaders in connection with the war-god celebration provided\r\nthe opportunity desired, since this would permit the blow to be\r\ndirected against those who were looked on as the promoters of the\r\nrevolt; and deprived of their leaders the people would be likely to\r\nabandon any further attempt. This plan met with general approval.[734]\r\n\r\nThe hour[735] having arrived for the visit to the temple,[736] Alvarado\r\nselects half the force to accompany him,[737] and proceeds thither,\r\narmed with more than usual care. Upon those who remain in charge of\r\nthe fort, says Tapia, devolves the safer, though even more cruel task\r\nof slaughtering the greater part of the courtiers and attendants,[738]\r\nwho have this day presented themselves in larger numbers than usual.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards with their Tlascaltec followers are welcomed at the\r\nsanctuary with great demonstrations by the unsuspecting nobles, who\r\nsee nothing to apprehend in the gleaming arms, since the Spaniards\r\nnever go forth without weapons. We must remember it is a gala day,\r\nand the court presents a magnificent scene with its festive decking\r\nof garlands, festoons, and drapery, and its gayly attired audience.\r\nA procession of plumed priests and pages march by with swinging\r\ncensers, chanting weird music before the hideous idols. Behind comes\r\na file of nuns and novices, with red feathers and painted faces,\r\nsurmounted by garlands of toasted maize, and bearing in their hands\r\nflags with black bars. Hidden musicians strike, and the dance begins.\r\nJoining the priests, the consecrated women and the tyros whirl round\r\na large brazier, while two shield-bearers with blackened faces direct\r\ntheir motions. A conspicuous figure is the _ixteocale_, the living\r\nrepresentative of the god, for whom he is fated to die, like the more\r\nprominent proxy of Tezcatlipoca. Dressed like a warrior ready for\r\nthe fray, and prepared to lead in the chief dances as is his duty,\r\nhe seems to impersonate the omen of evil which hovers over the scene.\r\n\r\nPresently the Spaniards are conducted to a separate court, wherein\r\nare assembled several hundred nobles and leading men, arrayed in\r\nrich costumes glittering with gold and precious stones. The centre\r\nof attraction is the new image of Huitzilopochtli, of _tzoalli_\r\ndough, its jacket wrought with human bones. Before this image the\r\n_mazehualiztli_ dance now begins.[739] Rings are formed round the\r\nmusic-stand, where two leaders direct the movements, the highest\r\nnobles and the most aged composing the inner circles, and the younger\r\nmen the outer. When all is ready the music strikes up lightly to a\r\nwell known tune, and the dancers move off, chanting a song bearing on\r\nthe event of the day, and on gods and kings.[740] Forewarned as the\r\nSpaniards are, they see treason in every act and word, and many who\r\nunderstand somewhat the Aztec language declare that the songs bear\r\ndistinct allusions to the intended uprising.\r\n\r\nAs the dance progresses a few of the soldiers, together with a number\r\nof Tlascaltecs, take possession of the different entrances, while the\r\nrest distribute themselves in suitable positions and watch for the\r\nsignal.[741] Instructed by his native allies, Alvarado waits the time\r\nwhen the Indians shall install the war-god image in the chapel. And\r\nnow the sanguinary moment has come. Falling on the assembly with pike\r\nand sword, some strike the idol and some its worshippers. They hew\r\ndown the priests and drive the cruel steel through the bodies of the\r\nnobles. Few of the Indians possess any weapons with which to defend\r\nthemselves from the sharp Toledo blades. Taken thus by surprise,\r\npanic-stricken, they tread one upon another, and then fall helpless\r\nunder the merciless thrusts of the enemy. Their first impulse has\r\nbeen to rush for the gates, but lines of bristling pikes oblige them\r\nto press back against the crowd, thereby increasing the confusion.\r\nSome attempt to climb over the high walls, some to hide in the temple\r\nbuildings, even burrowing beneath the heaps of the slain. Before an\r\nhour has passed there is nothing left in sight deemed worthy of Spanish\r\nswords, so suddenly has this brilliant assembly been transformed into\r\nloathsome masses of mangled bodies. The pathway of the conquerors is\r\neverywhere slippery with the blood of their victims.\r\n\r\nIn this horrible butchery, as we have seen, the lower classes suffered\r\nless than the nobles. Desolation was brought home to nearly every\r\nprominent family in the city. Their grief, shared by dependants and\r\nadherents throughout the provinces, was commemorated in plaintive\r\nballads, by which the people kept alive the hatred of their oppressors\r\nlong after the conquest. The estimates of the killed vary from four\r\nhundred to over three thousand, the most common number being six\r\nhundred; and as this generally refers to prominent personages it may\r\nbe accepted as not too low.[742]\r\n\r\nFinding no more to kill, or rather no more worth the killing, the\r\nSpaniards and the Tlascaltecs proceeded to plunder. The reward was\r\nrich, but even in the eyes of their national historians odium attached\r\nto every trinket, for by such action, as Herrera observes, they gave\r\ncurrency to the charge that the deed had been prompted by avarice. But\r\nthis interesting occupation was destined to be interrupted. Shouts from\r\nthe maddened multitude without were soon heard, roaring in response to\r\nthe death clamor of their countrymen. Warned by the guard at the gates,\r\nthe plunderers hastened to regain the fort. Yells of execration greeted\r\nthem as they issued from the temple, and showers of stones and darts\r\nfell thick, while the front ranks of the assailants pressed them with\r\nswords and clubs.[743] Short as was the distance to the fort, much time\r\nwas occupied in reaching it, and hardly a man escaped injury. Alvarado\r\nwas severely wounded, while one soldier and a number of allies were\r\nslain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [711] _Cartas_, 124; _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 12. Bernal\r\n     Diaz confirms that this was effected long before dawn, while\r\n     Herrera states that 300 held out till morning; but he is\r\n     contradictory. Carrasco, whom he assumes to be free, urged\r\n     them to fall upon the attacking party, who were scattered\r\n     to plunder. But this was not done for want of a leader. Nor\r\n     did they favor his advice to plunder the baggage of Cortés,\r\n     which was protected only by Indians, and to embark with\r\n     Diego Velazquez. Carrasco accordingly proceeded alone to the\r\n     baggage camp, and securing a horse and lance he returned\r\n     and urged them to follow. He had evidently supernatural\r\n     means wherewith to penetrate the besieging force. dec. ii.\r\n     lib. x. cap. iv. Duran allows Cortés to form ambuscades and\r\n     leap walls, so that the arms are secured ere the men of\r\n     Narvaez can form in defence. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 453.\r\n     Peter Martyr disposes briefly of the matter, and assumes\r\n     that the chief captains of Narvaez were seduced. dec. v.\r\n     cap. v.; _Castellanos_, _Varones ilustres de Indias_, 71-2;\r\n     _Galvano’s Discov._, 144-5.\r\n\r\n     [712] ‘Cortes se mandò pregonar por Capitan general, y\r\n     justicia mayor, de ambos exercitos.’ Carrasco was three\r\n     days in stocks before he yielded obedience. _Herrera_, ubi\r\n     sup. ‘Y todo esto era de noche, que no amanecia.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 99.\r\n\r\n     [713] ‘Viua, viua la gala de los Romanos, que siẽdo tan\r\n     pocos, han vencido a Narvaez!’ to which Guidelo, the negro\r\n     jester of Narvaez, added, ‘Behold! the Romans never performed\r\n     such a feat.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 99. Herrera\r\n     speaks more at length of the sayings of this negro, who\r\n     was rewarded with a crown of gold worth 600 ducats. dec.\r\n     ii. lib. x. cap. iv.\r\n\r\n     [714] ‘I saw Narvaez in Spain in 1525, and heard him publicly\r\n     denounce Cortés as a traitor. He asked but royal permission\r\n     to prove it, face to face with his enemy; furthermore,\r\n     he was a liar, a tyrant, and an ingrate. Narvaez had been\r\n     betrayed by those in whom he confided.’ _Oviedo_, iii. 316.\r\n     Still, the chronicler cannot excuse his carelessness nor\r\n     his entering into parley with Cortés; and he told him so.\r\n     iii. 316.\r\n\r\n     [715] Bernal Diaz mentions fifteen [a misprint of _dos_\r\n     for _doce_ makes it only five deaths among Narvaez’ men,\r\n     including Captain Rojas, Alférez Fuentes, who was an hidalgo\r\n     of Seville, and Carretero, one of the deserters from Cortés’\r\n     explorers. Cortés lost four. _Hist. Verdad._, 99. Cortés\r\n     prudently mentions to the king only two deaths, but leaves it\r\n     uncertain to what side they belonged. _Cartas_, 124. Gomara\r\n     claims them for Cortés, and states that Narvaez lost his eye,\r\n     his honor, and sixteen men. _Hist. Mex._, 148. Cortés lost\r\n     two men and one wounded; Narvaez eleven. _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. x. cap. iv. Cortés four, Narvaez eleven, besides\r\n     many wounded on both sides. _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt.\r\n     iii. 138. Solis supposes that two wounded of Cortés’ army\r\n     died, making four in all, while Narvaez lost fifteen. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, ii. 101. One version claims that Narvaez lost fifteen\r\n     by arms and six by fire in the burning of the quarters,\r\n     which is probably an exaggeration. Narvaez lost all his\r\n     property, including notes of hand. _Demanda de Ceballos_,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 442. The testimony in\r\n     _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. ii., varies from twelve to sixteen\r\n     for Narvaez.\r\n\r\n     [716] Oviedo looks on Cortés’ reasons as insufficient to\r\n     justify his procedure, such as ordering Narvaez to be seized,\r\n     and demanding of him to exhibit a royal commission, ‘as if\r\n     Cortés had been appointed by the king.’ Velazquez, as the\r\n     principal who sent him forth, had every right to remove\r\n     him. iii. 316.\r\n\r\n     [717] Bernal Diaz places the number at 1500, while Ceballos\r\n     raises it to 3000, under Heredia, and places the arrival\r\n     a day or two later. Herrera assumes that they came in time\r\n     to march with Cortés on Cempoala. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. i.\r\n\r\n     [718] Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 100, names Francisco\r\n     de Lugo as the captain of this party, but Tirado states\r\n     that he had been sent back to Mexico as an adherent of\r\n     Velazquez. _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 6. ‘Dió con los\r\n     once navios que el dicho mi parte allí tenia, al través, é\r\n     les fizo quemar.’ _Demanda de Ceballos_, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 442. Bernal Diaz also intimates that all\r\n     but two vessels were destroyed when the army proceeded to\r\n     Mexico and one afterward. _Hist. Verdad._, 109. It is not\r\n     probable, however, that more than a few were destroyed,\r\n     because unseaworthy. Some were wrecked a few months later.\r\n\r\n     [719] ‘Por Almirãte, y Capitan de la mar ... al qual\r\n     dizen que le dió primero buenos tejuelos de oro.’ His\r\n     baptismal name was either Juan or Pedro. Two vessels were\r\n     still expected to arrive. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     100, 113. Caballero was probably an old friend. ‘Pedro de\r\n     Maluenda criado de Diego Velazquez, que venia por mayordomo\r\n     de Naruaez, recogio y guardo los nauios y todo la ropa y\r\n     hazienda.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 148. By Cortés’ order,\r\n     adds Herrera.\r\n\r\n     [720] ‘Envié otros docientos hombres á la villa de la\r\n     Veracruz.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 125. Clavigero assumes that\r\n     Cortés at this time already gave orders for removing Villa\r\n     Rica southward, but events interfered with the project.\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 120.\r\n\r\n     [721] ‘Cortés le [Narvaez] tuvo preso con muy ásperas\r\n     prisiones tres años, poco mas ó menos, é con guardias que\r\n     nadie no le pudiese ver; é aquellos pasados, le quitó las\r\n     prisiones é le tuvo preso otros dos años.’ So says Narvaez’\r\n     agent. _Demanda de Ceballos_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._,\r\n     i. 442-3. The testimony in _Cortés_, _Residencia_, reduces\r\n     the term to two years, and intimates that several other\r\n     men were kept at Villa Rica, under surveillance at least.\r\n     i. 223, 362-3, et seq.\r\n\r\n     [722] Narvaez claims to have been robbed of 100,000\r\n     castellanos’ worth of effects, and it is not likely that his\r\n     property was restored. See _Demanda de Ceballos_, ubi sup.\r\n     Bernal Diaz had to surrender a horse fully accoutred, two\r\n     swords, three daggers, and other effects. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     100. Santa Clara intimates that the horses and arms were not\r\n     as a rule restored. _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 169. If so,\r\n     compensation was probably given, according to the _Relacion\r\n     hecha por el Señor Andrés de Tápia, sobre la Conquista de\r\n     México_. This is one of the most valuable documents extant on\r\n     the earlier period of the conquest, but it is unfortunately\r\n     only a fragment, which takes up the narrative from the eve\r\n     of leaving Cuba, and carries it to the capture of Narvaez,\r\n     relating with rather uneven completeness the principal\r\n     incidents of the voyage to Vera Cruz, the march to Mexico,\r\n     the stay there, and the operations against the forces of\r\n     Velazquez. Andrés de Tápia appears from his own statement\r\n     to have been a poor nephew of Governor Velazquez, to whom\r\n     he presented himself just in time to join the expedition\r\n     of Cortés. At this time, says Bernal Diaz, he was about 24\r\n     years old, of good build, with a grave face, slight beard,\r\n     and somewhat ashy complexion. _Hist. Verdad._, 246. He took\r\n     an active part in the leading wars and expeditions during\r\n     and after the conquest, and became one of the most noted\r\n     among the captains, favored by Cortés, with whom he was\r\n     frequently associated, accompanying him also on a voyage\r\n     to Spain. Settling in Mexico, he died there peacefully,\r\n     long after 1539, to judge from his reference to this date.\r\n     His narrative, as may be supposed, is a panegyric upon his\r\n     leader and patron, and some statements have accordingly to\r\n     be weighed, but this defect impairs the importance of only\r\n     a few passages, the rest being highly valuable, and many\r\n     of them unique in their testimony. Guided by a reference\r\n     in _Bibl. de Autores Esp._, xxii., Señor Icazbalceta of\r\n     Mexico obtained, after great trouble, a copy of the apparent\r\n     original from the Royal Academy of History, Madrid, entitled:\r\n     _Relacion de algunas cosas de las que acaecieron al Muy\r\n     Ilustre Señor Don Hernando Cortés_, etc. This he published\r\n     in his _Coleccion de Documentos_, ii. 554-94. The last three\r\n     pages form an appendix of brief remarks on the inhabitants\r\n     and resources of New Spain.\r\n\r\n     [723] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 149. ‘Dos dias después de\r\n     preso el dicho Narvaez, porque en aquella ciudad no se\r\n     podia sostener tanta gente ... despaché dos capitanes.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 125. Cortés writes that before leaving\r\n     for Mexico he sent Mexican envoys to obtain the friendship\r\n     and allegiance of the lord of Pánuco. This was at once\r\n     offered, and presents were exchanged. _Id._, 56-7, 125,\r\n     144-45. Cortés was either deceived or he invented the story\r\n     to counteract Garay’s schemes. Bernal Diaz names Ordaz for\r\n     Goazacoalco and Velazquez for Pánuco; but it has entirely\r\n     escaped his memory or notes that Velazquez had already\r\n     been charged to form a colony in Goazacoalco, for which\r\n     he was also better fitted, while Ordaz was more suited\r\n     for rough warfare in Pánuco. This author gives to each 120\r\n     men, twenty of them from the ranks of Cortés, ‘porq̄ teniã\r\n     mas experiẽcia en la guerra.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 100. The\r\n     200 allowed by others may include the ship-crews. Herrera\r\n     places 300 men under Ordaz. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. iv.\r\n\r\n     [724] For description of the feast, so as better to\r\n     understand what follows, see _Native Races_, ii. 317-21,\r\n     iii. 422-8.\r\n\r\n     [725] Oviedo refers the council and its acts only to the\r\n     time immediately preceding Cortés’ departure, iii. 509.\r\n\r\n     [726] ‘Esto afirmaron muchas mugeres, de las quales se sabia\r\n     siẽpre la verdad.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. viii.\r\n\r\n     [727] ‘Nos quitaron la comida e enbiando por ella no nos\r\n     la quisieron dar e nos davan de palos a las naborias e\r\n     estando lavando una yndia de las nuestras la hahogaron e\r\n     dezian e publicavan que asy avian de hazer a los españoles.’\r\n     _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 66. This testimony\r\n     is confirmed by a number of his followers.\r\n\r\n     [728] ‘Con muchas escalas para subir y matar a los\r\n     españoles.’ _Id._, 67. _Martin_, in _Id._, 144.\r\n\r\n     [729] ‘Le prince acolhua Tecocoltzin.’ _Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 287.\r\n\r\n     [730] ‘A number of poles were raised in the court-yard,\r\n     destined, as I was told, to impale the Spaniards, one\r\n     taller than the rest upon the pyramid being reserved for\r\n     me.’ _Alvarado_, in _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_,\r\n     66.\r\n\r\n     [731] Alvarado’s statements with regard to reports and signs\r\n     of revolt, and to the confession of several natives, is\r\n     confirmed by a number of witnesses, including the clergyman\r\n     Juan Diaz. _Id._, 66, 113, et seq. Tapia, who is arrayed\r\n     against Alvarado, intimates that torture induced the natives\r\n     to give the confirmation of the plot as desired by the\r\n     Spanish captain, and that the interpreter was unreliable.\r\n     One witness declares that the uprising was understood to\r\n     be planned to take place within ten days; another says on\r\n     the day following the torture, intimating that it was to\r\n     be after the great dances. _Id._, 37, 150. ‘Alvarado dixo,\r\n     que luego le auian de venir a dar guerra ... que lo supo\r\n     de vn Papa, y de dos Principales, y de otros Mexicanos.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 102.\r\n\r\n     [732] Tapia’s testimony to this and other criminating points\r\n     is particularly valuable, as he was a bitter opponent of\r\n     Alvarado. The latter states that Montezuma declared himself\r\n     powerless to prevent the premeditated sacrilege to the\r\n     Christian images. _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_,\r\n     36-7, 66-7. But this plea, if made, must, according to other\r\n     accounts, be interpreted to apply only to pagan ceremonies,\r\n     held almost before the images, and which might be regarded as\r\n     a sacrilege. Torquemada writes that arms had been collected\r\n     within the temple and everything prepared for the day when\r\n     the Spaniards attended by invitation to witness the dance\r\n     of the nobles. At a given signal an evidently simultaneous\r\n     attack was to be made on the assembled guests and on the\r\n     fort, thus taking the Spaniards at a disadvantage. Jars\r\n     stood prepared, filled with certain liquids, wherein to\r\n     cook their bodies for the feast. i. 489-90. The general\r\n     inclination of those who follow the Spanish version, of\r\n     which Torquemada, usually so stanch for the natives, is\r\n     here the best exponent, has been to assume that the attack\r\n     was arranged for the day of the great dances; and this\r\n     is not unlikely, although the original writers and their\r\n     commentators appear to be ignorant of or oblivious to certain\r\n     features of the festival. Another view has been to place\r\n     the attack during the installation of the new image of the\r\n     war-god. This ceremony belonged to the preceding day, a\r\n     fact not as a rule understood, and therefore the source of\r\n     much confusion. Brasseur de Bourbourg, who is clearest on\r\n     these points, assumes that the raising of the idol would\r\n     involve the casting forth of the Christian emblems, and\r\n     be the signal for attack. But evidences are conclusive\r\n     that the natives were not ready on that day. They were\r\n     too occupied with the celebration, and Alvarado, with his\r\n     small force, was not so negligent as to wait till the last\r\n     moment, when the enemy was fully prepared. He and several\r\n     of his men indicate clearly enough that they attended the\r\n     temple at the installation. The uprising must therefore have\r\n     been appointed for the following or even a later day. See\r\n     note 25. Vetancurt, _Teatro Mex._, iii. 139, is among the\r\n     authorities who follow the version of Torquemada in general.\r\n     One of the fervid-minded witnesses of Alvarado repeats the\r\n     account of pots and jars for cooking the Spaniards. Helps\r\n     supposes that Huitzilopochtli’s festival had not yet been\r\n     entered upon, and that Tezcatlipoca’s image is the one in\r\n     question; but the Spaniards, who knew the difference between\r\n     these idols, all affirm that the celebration of the war-god\r\n     was now held. See _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_,\r\n     69, 113, 130, 137, and 150.\r\n\r\n     [733] This received support from his neglect to interfere\r\n     when supplies were cut down. Even Tapia refers to a change\r\n     in his disposition, and to Alvarado’s displeasure thereat,\r\n     but his words may apply to the stoppage either of supplies or\r\n     of presents. _Id._, 36. Want of power could not be pleaded\r\n     by Montezuma, because a few days later, when the natives\r\n     were far more embittered both against the Spaniards and\r\n     against their captive sovereign, the latter was able by a\r\n     mere appeal to stay their onslaught. The testimony speaks\r\n     not only of an undermined wall and scaling ladders, but\r\n     of weapons, ‘porras y otras armas,’ and of conspirators\r\n     within the fort. _Id._, 67, 113, et seq. Gomara says that\r\n     his love for the Spaniards has been denied by some. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 154-5; but Bernal Diaz will not believe Montezuma\r\n     guilty of conspiracy. _Hist. Verdad._, 102. The grief of the\r\n     Spaniards at his death, and the care taken of his children,\r\n     indicate that they and the crown regarded him as loyal.\r\n\r\n     [734] ‘Los españoles lo requirieron al dicho D. Pedro.’\r\n     _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 150. Tapia pretends\r\n     that he objected. _Id._, 37.\r\n\r\n     [735] Alvarado and his men in more than one instance indicate\r\n     the day when the dough idol was raised. _Id._, 67, 113,\r\n     134. Ixtlilxochitl points to the following greater day,\r\n     which he dates May 19th. _Relaciones_, 412. Sahagun is not\r\n     so definite, but his editor accepts the chief day, calling\r\n     it whitsunday, May 27th. _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 99. In\r\n     another place he says May 25th. _Tezcuco en los ultimos\r\n     tiempos_, 274. One of Alvarado’s men states that it was a\r\n     Thursday. _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 131.\r\n\r\n     [736] The testimony of the conquerors, confirmed by native\r\n     paintings and records, leaves no doubt that the dance of\r\n     the nobles and the massacre took place in the great temple\r\n     adjoining the fort. _Ramirez_, _Proceso_, 37 et seq. Acosta\r\n     writes, however, that they occurred in the palace, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, 522, and he is partly right, since a massacre was\r\n     carried out here also. Clavigero follows Acosta, and assumes\r\n     that the fort is meant. He argues that the dance was held\r\n     there so that the emperor might, as customary, be present,\r\n     and that a massacre could not have been undertaken by so\r\n     few Spaniards in the great temple, where the arsenals were\r\n     situated, and where the concourse of people must have been\r\n     very large. _Storia Mess._, iii. 118. The Spaniards had\r\n     forbidden the use of arms during the festival, and none\r\n     appear to have been produced in the temple. Among other\r\n     precautions Alvarado appears to have insisted on a small\r\n     attendance beyond that of nobles, and most authorities so\r\n     accept it.\r\n\r\n     [737] Torquemada says 50 men; the Tlascaltecs are seldom\r\n     counted.\r\n\r\n     [738] ‘Que no quedaron sino el dicho Montezuma y quinze o\r\n     veynte criados,’ says the charge against Alvarado. _Ramirez_,\r\n     _Proceso_, 4, 20, 37, 43. This generally ignored part of the\r\n     massacre finds also indirect confirmation in the diffuse\r\n     testimony to the finding of concealed weapons among the\r\n     attendants of Montezuma. Alvarado would not have failed to\r\n     punish them for this.\r\n\r\n     [739] _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Relaciones_, 412. ‘Este bayle es\r\n     como el Netoteliztli.’ ‘Mazeualiztli: que quiere dezir\r\n     Merecimiento con trabajo.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 150.\r\n\r\n     [740] See _Native Races_, ii. 288-9.\r\n\r\n     [741] ‘Fue al patio donde estava el Oechilobos e vi mucha\r\n     gente junta para le subir e defendiendolo venia mucha gente\r\n     los quales comensaron a pelear con nosotros.’ _Ramirez_,\r\n     _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 67. This is a mere excuse\r\n     evidently, which none attempt to support, definitely at\r\n     least; but it sounded well to say that the actual fight began\r\n     on the native side, as had the plotting. One of Brasseur\r\n     de Bourbourg’s unique manuscripts states that the first\r\n     attack by the Spaniards was upon those who were advancing\r\n     with the idol. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 287. ‘Este testigo\r\n     desfizo el ydolo que los dichos yndios tenian para sobir\r\n     donde estava Nuestra Señora.’ _Nuño Pinto_, in _Ramirez_,\r\n     134.\r\n\r\n     [742] There were from 300 to 400 dancers, nearly all chiefs,\r\n     and an audience of from 2000 to 3000, says Tapia; and from\r\n     the wording of the accusation against Alvarado it appears\r\n     that all the chiefs were killed, and a number of the rest,\r\n     besides those slaughtered in the fort. Ramirez interprets\r\n     the native painting to signify 400, most likely of the\r\n     nobles only, _Id._, 4, 37, 286; 400 killed, _Cortés_,\r\n     _Residencia_, i. 41; over 600 nobles slaughtered in one\r\n     hour, _Cano_, in _Oviedo_, iii. 550; 600 to 1000 nobles\r\n     and caciques, _Gomara_; over 1000 nobles, _Ixtlilxochitl_,\r\n     _Relaciones_, 412, and _Brasseur de Bourbourg_. ‘Fué tan\r\n     grande el derramamiento de sangre, que corrian arroyos della\r\n     por el patio como agua cuando mucho llueve.’ _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 100. He gives sickening details\r\n     of truncated bodies, of dismembered hands and feet, and of\r\n     draggling entrails. Father Duran goes to an extreme in his\r\n     account, according to which Alvarado prompted the deed, and\r\n     Cortés executed it. From 8000 to 10,000 illustrious men were\r\n     summoned through Montezuma to assemble in the temple, in\r\n     order to permit Cortés to kill them and thus become master\r\n     in the country. He places ten soldiers at each gate, and\r\n     sends in ten to commit the slaughter. _Hist. Ind._, MS. ii.\r\n     456-9. Las Casas is not so absurd, this time at least, but\r\n     close behind him in the estimate, for he states that the\r\n     slaughter was carried on in different parts of the city\r\n     at the same time, and in one place alone about 2000 young\r\n     nobles fell. Prescott misinterprets him. ‘Non procul à\r\n     palatio aberant, duo circiter millia juvenum nobilium.... Ad\r\n     hos se contulit Hispanorum Capitaneus, & alios ad reliquas\r\n     urbis partes, in quibus hæ choreæ celebrabantur, misit,\r\n     ... non cessabunt celebrare & lamentari ... calamitatem,’\r\n     etc. _Regio. Ind. Devastat._, 32.\r\n\r\n     [743] _Tapia_, and others, in _Ramirez_, 38, 67, 131.\r\n     Torquemada assumes that the arms used by the assailants\r\n     were those which had been collected for the outbreak in the\r\n     houses adjoining the temple, i. 490. As regards the motives\r\n     for the massacre, the Spanish authorities seek as a rule to\r\n     justify them, while the native accounts are equally inclined\r\n     to ascribe them to greed or to wanton cruelty. According to\r\n     Sahagun the celebration was held at the instance of Alvarado,\r\n     who slaughtered the devotees without known cause. _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, 27 (ed. 1840), 100. Duran, who is as prejudiced\r\n     as he is blundering, dates the massacre after the return\r\n     of Cortés from the coast. Alvarado persuades him to secure\r\n     the submission of the country by killing all the lords and\r\n     chiefs, and they are accordingly allured to their death.\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 456-7. Las Casas inclines to a similar\r\n     motive; ‘quo magis cresceret, & augeretur in his provinciis\r\n     formido illorum crudelitatis.’ _Regio. Ind. Devastat._, 30.\r\n     Nearer the truth comes Ixtlilxochitl, who, while disposed\r\n     to credit his countrymen, dares not accuse the Spaniards,\r\n     and so takes the prudent middle course of casting the blame\r\n     on the Tlascaltecs. Prompted by the hatred bred of former\r\n     wrongs inflicted by Mexicans, and by greed for spoils, they\r\n     invent charges of treason and speedy revolt. Alvarado, being\r\n     also avaricious, is readily induced to believe them, and\r\n     considers it besides a good opportunity to obtain control\r\n     by dispatching the assembled chiefs, unarmed as they are.\r\n     _Hist. Chich._, 300; _Relaciones_, 389, 412. Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     is not to blame for his assumption, since his admired\r\n     guide, the biographer of Cortés, does not attempt to defend\r\n     Alvarado, but merely mentions that he was influenced either\r\n     by reports of a proposed uprising or by avarice. _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 151. The commentator Chimalpain says bluntly\r\n     that the latter motive ‘es mas de creer.’ _Hist. Conq._,\r\n     i. 281; _Benzoni_, _Mondo Nuovo_, 94; _Pizarro y Orellana_,\r\n     _Varones Ilvstres_, 92. Vetancurt rather condemns Alvarado\r\n     for acting on insufficient evidence. _Teatro Mex._, pt.\r\n     iii. 139-40. Cortés’ silence respecting the cause may be\r\n     attributed to his usual prudence in suppressing unpleasant\r\n     facts. He states, however, that Montezuma supplicated him\r\n     not to be annoyed at what had happened, since he regretted\r\n     it as much as the Spaniards. This implies that the Indians\r\n     were regarded as originators of the trouble. The severity\r\n     with which he treated the emperor on his return to Mexico,\r\n     notwithstanding the efforts made by him to save the\r\n     Spaniards, indicates still more strongly that Cortés was\r\n     convinced of Mexican treachery. _Cartas_, 126 et seq. In the\r\n     letter of the army to the emperor the uprising is attributed\r\n     to Narvaez’ plots. _Carta del Ejército_, in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 429. Herrera notices the native versions,\r\n     particularly that which accuses the Tlascaltecs of having\r\n     trumped up charges against the Mexicans, but he affirms,\r\n     ‘la verdad fue, que pensaron matar los Castellanos.’ He\r\n     thereupon enumerates proofs of the plot. dec. ii. lib. x.\r\n     cap. viii. Torquemada, who is more fully acquainted with\r\n     native accounts, condemns them as unreliable, and states\r\n     that Sahagun accepted them without investigation, i.\r\n     489-91. The charge that Alvarado was influenced by avarice\r\n     is promptly rejected by Bernal Diaz. ‘No lo creo, ni nunca\r\n     tal oí, ni es de creer que tal hiziesse.’ His motive was to\r\n     inspire terror and inflict such injury as to prevent the\r\n     Indians from attacking him. That they intended to attack,\r\n     Bernal Diaz fully believes. _Hist. Verdad._, 102. Solis is\r\n     quite indignant at the supposition that avarice impelled\r\n     the Spaniards. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 117. According to Oviedo\r\n     the intention of the natives was to kill also Cortés on\r\n     his return. He inserts without comment the version of\r\n     Cano, married to Montezuma’s daughter, that avarice was\r\n     the motive, iii. 510, 550. Acosta, who generally adheres\r\n     to native versions, does not apparently find them reliable\r\n     in this case, since he merely says that a ‘chastisement’\r\n     was inflicted, but that it was excessive. _Hist. Ind._,\r\n     522. This is also the opinion of Clavigero, who believes\r\n     that the Spaniards were deceived by Tlascaltec stories of\r\n     a plot, and wished to anticipate it, on the principle that\r\n     ‘chi assalisce vince. Checchessia, la sua condotta non può\r\n     scusarsi d’imprudenza, e di crudeltà.’ _Storia Mess._, iii.\r\n     119. This view has been widely adopted, even by the modern\r\n     Mexican historian Carbajal Espinosa, plagiarist though he be.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, ii. 339. His confrère Bustamante, as editor\r\n     of Sahagun, is inclined to magnify even the exaggerations\r\n     of the latter. Prescott wavers between Clavigero’s views\r\n     and disbelief in Alvarado’s apology. But in expressing\r\n     his opinion he misconstrues Bernal Diaz and raises some\r\n     meaningless questions. _Mex._, ii. 284-6. There is no doubt\r\n     that the Indians were bent on mischief. A large faction had\r\n     been hostile to the Spaniards ever since their arrival, as\r\n     intruders who menaced the existing politic, economic, and\r\n     religious order. This feeling had been steadily spreading\r\n     under the threatening attitude assumed by the unbidden\r\n     guests in seizing the emperor, in extorting tribute, and in\r\n     assuming mastery. With the occupation of the temple by the\r\n     Christian emblems the climax was reached; and now the whole\r\n     population became possessed with a desire to avenge not only\r\n     the outraged idols, but themselves and their sovereign,\r\n     and to uphold the tottering throne. The observations of\r\n     the Spaniards and the reports of their informers were\r\n     correct in pointing to an uprising, to take place during\r\n     the gathering of pilgrims for the war-god festival, when\r\n     the reduced number of the Spanish garrison favored the\r\n     design. The confession of several natives, whether extorted\r\n     by torture or not, confirmed the charges and justified\r\n     belief. Alvarado could not as a prudent commander ignore\r\n     them, and duty required him to use prompt measures for the\r\n     protection of his force, and of the interests of his king\r\n     and the expedition. It might be urged by those who seek to\r\n     defend this kind of thing that seizure of the victims for\r\n     hostages would have been equally effective and more humane;\r\n     but from the precedence established by the general himself\r\n     at Cholula the conduct of the rash Alvarado is scarcely to\r\n     be wondered at. Cortés’ object had been to strike terror\r\n     as the only effective lesson for a people who seemed\r\n     to recognize no other sway, and if this was regarded as\r\n     necessary with the Cholultecs, Alvarado must have held it to\r\n     be doubly so now. His position was far more critical than\r\n     that at the former city, for his resources were smaller,\r\n     the prospect of aid was hopeless, and escape was cut off.\r\n     He had to strike promptly and strike well. Here were the\r\n     leaders, and here the temple, wherein a punishment would\r\n     apparently have greater effect. It was natural to suppose\r\n     that the installation of the war-god would be attended by\r\n     the leaders or representative men of the enemy; and to\r\n     level the blow at this class must be considered as less\r\n     cruel at least than to strike the multitude, as at Cholula.\r\n     Perhaps the recognition of this was a reason for the silence\r\n     of Cortés. All this discussion, however, as to the minor\r\n     motives prompting a dastardly deed I do not regard as very\r\n     relevant. I am very sure that the motives of the Spaniards\r\n     in this massacre were not plunder. They were playing for\r\n     a higher stake, for the whole country, and, in case they\r\n     won, all in it would be theirs. The present heavy blow was\r\n     but one of the points in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nUPRISING OF THE AZTECS.\r\n\r\nMAY-JUNE, 1520.\r\n\r\n     CHARACTER OF THE AZTECS—SPANISH QUARTERS—THE CITY IN\r\n     ARMS—GROWING HATRED TOWARD THE INVADERS—PERILOUS POSITION\r\n     OF ALVARADO—MONTEZUMA CALLED TO INTERFERE—FAILING\r\n     PROVISIONS—MIRACULOUS WATER—CORTÉS TO THE RESCUE—RENDEZVOUS\r\n     AT TLASCALA—THE CITY AND ITS PEOPLE—THE ARMY JOINS\r\n     ALVARADO—DESPERATE ENCOUNTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards had mistaken somewhat the character of the Aztecs.\r\nGround to the dust by political despotism and bloody superstition,\r\ntheir features had assumed a melancholy cast and their form the\r\nattitude of humility. Yet beneath all slumbered a ferocity the most\r\nblood-thirsty among the Nahua nations. And now, though their nature\r\nmight be as cold and impassive as the stone of the pavement, the iron\r\nheel of the conqueror had struck fire from it.\r\n\r\nBefore the fort the angry throng increased, until the whole city seemed\r\nto have gathered there. On the roofs and in the courts fell showers\r\nof arrows, stones, and darts, and charge after charge was made at\r\nthe entrances. Attempts were also made both to scale and undermine\r\nthe walls, and some resorted to battering, until it seemed to the\r\nbesieged as if the whole habitation was coming down upon their heads.\r\n\r\nThe structure consisted of a vast irregular pile of stone buildings,\r\none story in height, and raised, like most of the pretentious edifices,\r\non a pyramidal foundation, which was low and difficult to undermine or\r\nbeat down. An occasional tower relieved the monotony of the outline\r\nand offered a view over the neighborhood. Beside the smaller courts\r\ninclosed by the buildings, a larger yard appears to have been formed by\r\na stout wall, within which the allies had erected temporary shelter.\r\nThis was the weakest point, and here the battering parties were\r\nchiefly collected. The flanks and curtains of modern fortification\r\nwere wanting, and the protection of the wall face depended on the\r\nturrets which rose here and there, and on the parapets, with their\r\nfew embrasures.\r\n\r\nThough attempting no sortie beyond the immediate vicinity of the\r\ngates, the Spaniards were not sparing of powder and arrows, and picked\r\noff the more presumptuous assailants, while their pikes and swords\r\ndid good service at the parapets and openings. The cannon, however,\r\nloaded as they were with small shot and scraps, which brought down\r\na dozen or more at a time, were the only weapons that could hold the\r\nenemy in check. On one occasion, when a charging party had approached\r\nin a somewhat wavering column to carry the main entrance, the cannon\r\ncharge failed to explode, owing to dampness. This the assailants\r\nwere quick to observe, and with yells of encouragement they rushed\r\nforward, and were soon in a hand-to-hand conflict with a party which\r\nhad sallied to break the first column. The Spaniards plied their\r\nswords and pikes with desperation, supported by a desultory fire\r\nfrom the musketeers and archers of the fort, but without effect. The\r\ngaps made by their weapons were quickly filled with fresh warriors,\r\nand the sallying party was obliged to fall back with the loss of two\r\nsoldiers, who were captured alive and devoted to sacrifice. It was a\r\ncritical moment, for the enraged horde was about to follow them into\r\nthe quarters. Just then, as if touched by invisible fire, the powder\r\nignited, sending from the cannon its death-dealing missiles, mowing\r\na path through the crowd of pursuers. The Mexicans were appalled and\r\nspeedily thrown into disorder, of which the Spaniards were not slow\r\nto take advantage. Nor was this the only miracle of the day; for it\r\nis alleged that the virgin, and he of the dazzling white steed, both\r\nappeared fighting on the side of the Spaniards, and bringing defeat\r\nand confusion upon their assailants, as at Tabasco and Tlascala.[744]\r\n\r\nThus closed the first day of Alvarado’s chivalrous doings, during which\r\na large number were wounded, although there were but six killed,[745]\r\nnot including allies. A portion of the quarters, with a quantity of\r\nammunition and supplies, had been burned, and a large breach made\r\nin the wall. The brigantines were also burned, the bridges raised,\r\nand barricades erected in different parts of the city; while the\r\nsupply of provisions was cut off. Even after darkness had stilled the\r\nfury of the warriors the unhappy people remained before the Spanish\r\nquarters, and with outstretched arms and dishevelled hair they lifted\r\nup their voices, crying, “You are doomed, you vile things! But for\r\nyour thunder and your fortress walls, curses on them, you would now\r\nbe killed and cooked. And you shall be, unless you instantly release\r\nMontezuma and depart. You shall meet with holy death, and be cooked\r\nwith _chilmole_, and be given as food to the eagles and the beasts,\r\nfor your flesh is bitter, as we have found, and not fit for men to\r\neat. Why does not the earth swallow you alive? Oh ye gods! ye gods!\r\nunmoved all, all but the devilish gods of these devilish men. But our\r\nmighty ones, whom you have outraged, shall yet give you your deserts.\r\nIf they do not, we shall; nor shall they escape, the despicable ones\r\nof Tlascala, your slaves, who serve you as women and hire out the\r\nwives of their lords!” Thus raved the heart-broken.\r\n\r\nSo critical had become his condition on the second day that Alvarado\r\nappealed to Montezuma to exert his influence to stay the assailants,\r\nintimating that if the Spaniards perished so would the Aztec king.\r\nMontezuma’s overtures were not received with enthusiasm by the\r\npeople; nevertheless aggressive operations were reduced to desultory\r\nattacks.[746] Water was greatly needed by the besieged, and again the\r\ngood fortune of the Spaniards, which hardly ever forsook them, came\r\nto their aid. Digging, under inspiration or desperation, they struck\r\nfresh water within the fortress,[747] and offered thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nCommunication was shortly after established between Alvarado and\r\nCortés. Several Tlascaltecs and Cholultecs were despatched by\r\ndifferent routes to the coast, and a courier arrived from Cempoala\r\nand gained entrance to the fort.[748] Ordering Velazquez and Ordaz\r\nto abandon their mission and direct their march to Tlascala, Cortés\r\nhastened preparations to join them there. A garrison of one hundred\r\nmen was left at Villa Rica, under Rodrigo Rangel, a relative of the\r\ngeneral,[749] and about thirty men remained at Cempoala to take charge\r\nof the sick and wounded, and some baggage, with orders to follow as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe route to the plateau lay partly through a bleak and desert country,\r\nand the inhabitants being beside less friendly than before, the army\r\nwould have found it difficult to obtain supplies; but Cortés had\r\ngathered experience from his previous march, and Tlascala was entered\r\nin the middle of June.[750] A hearty reception was accorded, and\r\nmore encouraging news obtained from Mexico, showing that the siege\r\nmaintained its passive character. Reinforcements were nevertheless\r\nurgent, since a fresh outbreak might at any time occur. A message was\r\nagain sent to gladden the garrison with promises of speedy relief.[751]\r\n\r\nIncluding the troops under Velazquez and Ordaz the muster-roll\r\nshowed about eleven hundred men, with some eighty horses, one hundred\r\ncross-bows, and eighty fire-arms, besides several cannon, and a large\r\nquantity of ammunition.[752] The heart of the company, however, was\r\nthe veterans of Cortés, whose superior discipline and familiarity\r\nwith native warfare made them doubly reliable. Eager for a fray with\r\nthe detested Aztecs, and desirous of excusing their refusal of men\r\na month before, the Tlascaltecs offered not only supplies but large\r\nreinforcements, of which only two thousand were accepted, besides a\r\nsmall number from Cholula and Huexotzinco.\r\n\r\nThe more northerly route by way of Calpulalpan, recommended already on\r\nthe former march as the easiest, was this time selected, partly with\r\na view to obtain provisions more readily.[753] As the lake region was\r\napproached evidences were seen of the revolt in deserted villages and\r\nin the sullen demeanor of the few Indians who showed themselves. The\r\ncontrast was chilling indeed as compared with the reception accorded\r\non the former occasion, when the journey resembled the triumphal\r\nmarch of gods. Oppressed with misgivings the army entered Tezcuco,\r\nthe seat of the Acolhua kings, a few leagues north of Mexico, on the\r\nborder of the same lake.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most ancient cities of the country, ranking since\r\nthe early half of the eighth century as the capital of a dominion\r\nfounded by Tezcatlipoca, the later supreme deity of the Nahuas.\r\nAfter the fall of the Toltec empire it took the leading position in\r\nAnáhuac, as the centre of Chichimec power. The new dynasty fostered\r\nthe inherited culture in every way, and made the city not only the\r\npolitical capital, but the Athens of the country. The rise of the\r\nAztecs gave it a rival in Mexico, which in course of the fifteenth\r\ncentury assumed the political sceptre, but Tezcuco still maintained\r\nthe precedence in culture and elegance. It was said to contain one\r\nhundred and forty thousand houses, distributed among different suburbs,\r\nand extending with their smiling gardens from the border of the lake\r\nto a distance of from three to four leagues. The six divisions of the\r\ncity were crossed by a series of fine streets lined with tasteful and\r\ncostly buildings. Among the finest structures were the two palaces,\r\nwhich are claimed to have excelled those of Mexico. The older, the\r\nHuetecpan, wherein the poet-king Nezahualcoyotl held his court, formed\r\na magnificent monument of his artistic taste. It lay upon a triple\r\nterrace bathed by the lake, and was surrounded by an immense wall,\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty-five feet high, inclosing two large squares.\r\nWithin this precinct were the council-chambers, the halls for various\r\narts and sciences, and the royal apartments. The pleasure-grounds,\r\nalmost hedged by cedars, were filled with shady groves, traversed\r\nby labyrinthian paths, and interspersed with well stocked ponds\r\nand aviaries, baths, and sparkling fountains. The new palace, which\r\noccupied a smaller space, excelled in imposing architecture and in\r\ncomforts of the most varied character.\r\n\r\nBeside these there were a number of summer resorts in the neighborhood,\r\nconspicuous among them the fine palace of Tezcocingo, a prototype\r\nof Chapultepec, and like it overlooking the capital from a hill, two\r\nleagues to the east. An aqueduct of stone supplied two reservoirs on\r\nthe summit, whence the water was distributed over grounds intersected\r\nby canals with meandering currents and picturesque cascades. The\r\npalace lay almost hidden within groves of gigantic cedar and cypress,\r\nrevealing to the rapt beholder pavilions of marble, tessellated\r\npavements, and playing fountains with statuary of unique form.[754]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards found none to welcome them, but were allowed unmolested\r\nto take up their quarters in the palace. Shortly afterward a\r\ncanoe arrived from Mexico[755] with an imperial messenger and a\r\nSpaniard,[756] bearing the cheering news that everything had been\r\nquiet in the capital for some time, and that supplies, which had been\r\nscantily furnished only against heavy payments, had now become more\r\nliberal. Montezuma sent word that the city would return to its normal\r\ncondition the moment Cortés entered it, and he expressed a hope that\r\nno ill-will would be entertained toward him for what had happened,\r\nsince this had been beyond his control, and had grieved him as much\r\nas the Spaniards. Reassuring messages were forwarded to Villa Rica.\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of four days the army proceeded from Tezcuco by the\r\nnorthern shore of the lake, and camped for the night at Tepeyacac,\r\nthe terminus of the northern causeway from Mexico.[757] On entering\r\nthis place the horse of Solis, Casquete, stepped into a hole on the\r\nbridge and broke a leg, throwing its rider into the water. This was\r\nlooked on as a bad omen, particularly by an astrologer soldier named\r\nBotello, but Cortés made light of it, saying, “Troubles at St John’s\r\nfestival bring peace for the year.”[758] The following morning, St\r\nJohn’s day, the army entered the capital. On all sides an ominous\r\nsilence prevailed. The streets were deserted, the houses apparently\r\nabandoned, and the solitary native occasionally seen hovered in the\r\ndistance like a shadow.[759] It was also noticed with apprehension\r\nthat many of the canal bridges were removed. On approaching the\r\nAxayacatl palace the arrival was heralded by trumpet blasts, which\r\ncalled forth responsive shouts from the garrison. Throwing open the\r\ngates, the besieged received their deliverers with the most extravagant\r\ndemonstrations of joy.[760] For greater accommodation a part of the\r\ntroops were quartered in the great temple adjoining the fort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe unpleasant aspect of affairs, so apparent during the last days\r\nof the march, had ruffled the temper of Cortés, and his treatment\r\nof Alvarado was not altogether cordial. Still, as he had ever been\r\na close friend, and as he was an invaluable officer, brave and\r\ninfluential, he deemed it prudent to go no further than to express\r\na curt disapproval of his rashness.[761] Indeed, an inquiry into\r\nthe causes and results of the massacre could criminate Alvarado no\r\nfurther than the Cholula affair did himself. The captain had acted\r\nin full accord with his party, and whatever blame might attach must\r\nbe shared by all. Dissension would never answer, and so the matter\r\nwas dropped. But the ill-temper which the general dared not wreak on\r\nhis own men found a ready object in Montezuma. The conduct of Cortés\r\nin this respect was most ungenerous. It shows the several sides of\r\nhumanity: how odious in some respects are those who appear to the\r\nbest advantage in other respects. This poor king had a superstitious\r\nsympathy, a maudlin affection for the captain, who, considering his\r\nown infamous conduct toward him, might at least have saved the captive\r\nunnecessary mental suffering. As Cortés entered the fort Montezuma\r\nstepped out of his apartment to welcome him. The cavalier passed by\r\nthe king in lofty disdain, ignoring his presence. Cut to the quick,\r\nthe monarch shrank back, apparently more stunned by this treatment\r\nthan by the late terrible slaughter of his subjects.[762] He retired\r\ndeeply chagrined to pour his sorrow into Olmedo’s ear. “What can I\r\ndo?” he cried; “he loves gold and fame, and I will give him a life-size\r\nequestrian statue of himself in gold if he will but be kind to me.”\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of the main forces supplies were stopped, as if in\r\nprotest, and Cortés became only the more irritated. Accordingly, when\r\ntwo chiefs appeared on behalf of the emperor to ask for an interview\r\nthey were repulsed with the insulting epithet of ‘dogs!’ Velazquez\r\nand other officers remonstrated against the policy of this rudeness to\r\none who had interfered to save his troops. “What consideration can I\r\nhave for a dog?” was the dastardly rejoinder. “Was he not willing to\r\ntreat with Narvaez, and does he not now seek to starve us?” Persuaded\r\npresently of the necessity for imperial interposition, he addressed\r\nthe chiefs roughly, “Tell your master, Montezuma, to order markets to\r\nbe held at once, or there will be trouble.” His tone and gesture were\r\nsufficient indications to the chiefs of the insults offered to them\r\nand their august lord, and they failed not to give them full force in\r\ntheir report. In answer to the demand Montezuma said that he and his\r\nchief officials were prisoners, and that nothing could be effected\r\nwithout the release of one among them. Cortés saw the necessity,\r\nand, without considering the result, released Cuitlahuatzin, lord of\r\nIztapalapan, the emperor’s brother, and generalissimo of the army, a\r\nman whose hostility to everything Spanish was well known. According\r\nto Aztec law he was the most probable successor to the throne, and\r\ntherefore particularly dangerous.[763]\r\n\r\nCortés was becoming foolhardy. Whether the brothers were in accord\r\nupon the measures to be adopted is uncertain; but Cuitlahuatzin,\r\nwho was not only bold, but ambitious, had evidently determined on\r\nhis course. If the Mexicans had hoped for better prospects with the\r\narrival of Cortés that hope was now dissipated, and bitter indignation\r\nfilled their breasts. Cuitlahuatzin was welcomed as a liberator. His\r\nconstant efforts in the imperial council to oppose the admission of\r\nthe Spaniards, by force if necessary, and his services for the cause\r\nof liberty and religion in connection with the Cacama revolt, were\r\nsufficient to endear him to his brother patriots. Strongly urged, he\r\naccepted the leadership of the insurgents, a position for which his\r\nexperience and success as a general had well fitted him. He began\r\nby ordering war material and erecting barricades. The value of the\r\nChinantec pikes introduced by Cortés had not been lost on him, and\r\na number were provided, barbed with the vitreous iztli. Arrangements\r\nwere made with adjoining towns and provinces for a supply of provisions\r\nand reinforcements to carry on the holy war.[764]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards soon learned what was brewing, and first in this way:\r\nOjeda and Marquez, when out foraging early in the morning of the day\r\nfollowing their arrival, observed several suspicious circumstances,\r\namong others broken bridges, which in one place obliged them to\r\nfill up a canal before crossing it. Here and there they saw large\r\ncollections of slings and other weapons, and presently they came on a\r\npriest with dishevelled hair shouting with wild gesticulations to a\r\ncrowd of armed men. They hurried back to inform the general, guided\r\nthrough intricate cross-streets by a Tlascaltec. Antonio del Rio,\r\nwho had been despatched for Villa Rica the same morning, returned\r\nat a gallop in less than half an hour, excited and bleeding. The\r\nstreets, he said, were full of warriors, who had raised the bridges\r\nand were apparently prepared to attack. Had it not been for his trusty\r\nsword and swift horse he would have been slain. At this moment the\r\nsentinels in the towers announced the approach of a vast multitude\r\nfrom different directions, with gleaming iztli weapons, and speedily\r\nthe neighborhood was alive with warriors, whose yells rose high above\r\nthe shrill shell and doleful drum.[765] Even if they did not inspire\r\nthe full measure of dread intended they presented a striking picture\r\nin their painted bodies, grotesque with patterns and brilliant colors,\r\nwith no covering among the rank and file save the raw cotton on the\r\nhead and the universal maxtli round the loins. They were protected\r\nin part by the _chimalli_, or shield, a slight bamboo frame covered\r\nwith gaudily colored skin or reed-grass, chiefly oval and round, and\r\noften large enough to cover the whole body. Secured to the arm it left\r\nthe hand free to hold the bow or stone, while the right managed the\r\narrow or the sling. The latter was an implement of great effect with\r\nthe Aztecs, who could impel the stone with wonderful precision and\r\nforce. The _maza_, or club, with its knotty head, and the _macana_,\r\nor sword, toothed with iztli, were well represented, while high above\r\ngleamed the obsidian or copper points of the spear. One of the most\r\ndreaded weapons was the _tlacochtli_, or javelin, often provided with\r\nthree points, and attached to a cord by which it could be recovered\r\nfor a fresh cast. Conspicuous among the warriors were the nobles,\r\nthose that were left of them, in lofty quetzal plumage on a head-dress\r\nof green feathers set in tiger-skin, or in a gold or silver band,\r\nwhich gave the appearance of metal helmets. The body was covered in\r\ncorselets of red, green, or yellow feathers, worked with gold, and so\r\narranged as to indicate the company or district to which the wearer\r\nbelonged. Beneath gleamed occasionally cuirasses of gold or silver.\r\nThe limbs were covered with wood or leather armor set with feathers\r\nor gold plates. A more common body armor was the cotton tunic, one\r\nor two fingers in thickness, which extended to the knees and elbows.\r\nIt was almost equivalent to the quilted cotton protector used on the\r\neastern coast, whose efficiency against native weapons had caused\r\nthe Spaniards to adopt it. The tunic was adorned with feathers, which\r\ncorresponded to the uniform in color and arrangement, usually in the\r\nform of an animal. Many were distinguished by casques in the form of\r\neagle-heads, and in armor spotted like a tiger-skin, indicative of the\r\ntwo orders of Quauhtin and Ocelome, eagles and tigers. At the head of\r\nthe different columns appeared officers with small drums, painted and\r\nadorned with feathers, with which they directed the march. Beyond,\r\nin the centre of the masses, could be seen banners, with devices\r\nin various colors and forms, which the Tlascaltecs pointed out as\r\nbelonging to different wards and to cities on the mainland, a sign\r\nthat an extensive body of troops had been enlisted for the war.[766]\r\n\r\nAs the forces drew near, slingers and bowmen appeared on the roofs\r\nof the neighboring buildings, who, together with those below, began\r\nto send stones, arrows, and darts in showers upon the fort. The\r\nSpaniards responded with a series of volleys, the number of cannon\r\nbeing increased to twelve or more. The effect was merely to startle\r\nthem for a moment, and on they pressed over dead and dying, amid\r\nencouraging shouts, till they reached the sides of the wall, where\r\nthe dreaded cannon, at least, could not destroy them. All attempts to\r\nscale the wall proved futile, and soon their efforts were confined to\r\neffecting breaches. With their rude implements this was slow work,\r\nbut they persevered with reckless obstinacy, reinforced at frequent\r\nintervals, while the main body kept up a galling discharge of missiles,\r\nand occupied the attention of the besieged with continual charges at\r\ndifferent points.\r\n\r\nThis passive or defensive policy did not suit the Spaniards, while\r\nit encouraged the Aztecs. Therefore two corps were formed, each of\r\ntwo hundred men, besides allies, under Cortés and Ordaz. Clearing a\r\npath with a volley of artillery, they sallied in different directions\r\nto drive back the assailants, who hurried for safety into lanes and\r\nhouses, and behind barricades. This comparative freedom of advance\r\nappears to have been permitted to entice the Spaniards into a\r\ndisadvantageous position, for soon the natives reappeared in swarms\r\nin the rear and along the flanks, showering arrows and stones, and\r\ncoming to close quarters with spears and swords. The heaviest attack\r\nwas from the roofs, on which large supplies of missiles had been\r\ncollected, and from which commanding position the enemy was able\r\nto direct the discharges with terrible effect, particularly upon\r\nthe naked Tlascaltecs. Several Spaniards also fell, and the greater\r\nnumber were wounded. Ordaz received three cuts, and Cortés a wound\r\nwhich maimed two fingers of the left hand.[767] The assailants were\r\ncomparatively safe, for those on the roofs could be picked off only\r\nby archers and musketeers, and those below took refuge when pressed,\r\nonly to return to fresh attack. Efforts were made to fire the houses,\r\nbut this was slow work, since they were constructed almost wholly of\r\nadobe or stone, and were filled with defenders. Nor would the fire\r\nspread, owing to the detached form of the buildings, separated by\r\nalleys or canals, so that the torch had to be applied to each.\r\n\r\nThus matters continued until Ordaz, who was engaged on the street to\r\nthe west of the fort, sent word to Cortés, who was pressing forward\r\nin the direction of the Iztapalapan causeway, that he was losing\r\nground. Leaving his own forces, the general hurried to the scene with\r\na few horsemen, and heading the charge, drove back the warriors at\r\nthe most exposed point, so as to relieve the infantry in the retreat\r\nwhich was now found necessary. Returning to his men he found them also\r\nretreating, those who headed the column, including Andrés Duero, the\r\nCuban secretary, having been cut down. “Shame upon you!” exclaimed\r\nCortés to the corps, as he led the horsemen to the rescue of the\r\nfallen cavaliers. He was just in time to save them, for a moment more\r\nand Duero, at least, would have been slain. The elated warriors fell\r\nback before the charge of the terrible Malinche, although they soon\r\nrecovered. Cortés then concluded to retreat, but this proved no less\r\ndangerous than the advance, and among others Lezcano was dragged from\r\nhis horse and killed, after having distinguished himself for bravery\r\nand execution. The fort had meanwhile sustained an active siege,\r\nand when the retreating corps approached it they found more enemies\r\nin waiting, who, fearful of losing their prey, rushed forward with\r\ngreater fury than ever. An entrance was finally effected, the forces\r\nin the temple being at the same time withdrawn for the greater safety\r\nof themselves and the fort.[768]\r\n\r\nSwelling with triumph the Aztecs now directed all their efforts\r\nagainst the Spanish quarters. Burning arrows and whirling brands began\r\nto mingle with their missiles. Although the building itself was of\r\nstone, the roof and portions of the outwork, and the Tlascaltec camp\r\nin the yards, were of inflammable material, and more than once the\r\nflames burst forth, filling the whole place with suffocating smoke,\r\nand calling for the greatest exertions to subdue them. The little\r\nwater at hand could not be spared, and so earth was cast up, and\r\nportions of the wall were torn down to check the fire and to stop\r\nthe gaps. The assault continued all day, till darkness sent most of\r\nthe warriors to their homes.[769]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [744] Which speaks little to the credit of either Mary or\r\n     Santiago. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 102. ‘Otro miraglo\r\n     ... é fué muy notorio.’ ‘Ya sé que los incrédulos ... dirán\r\n     que mi ocupaçion en esto de miraglos, pues no los ví, es\r\n     supérflua ... é yo hablo que esto é más se puede é debe\r\n     creer;’ for did the Indians have mysteries and miracles,\r\n     surely God, the virgin, and the saints could effect greater\r\n     deeds. _Oviedo_, iii. 511. He quotes from Livy and others\r\n     concerning the reliable miracles of Roman times. Prescott\r\n     and others transfer the miracles to the siege under Cortés\r\n     for greater effect. Bustamante, the modern champion of the\r\n     shrines of Mexico, who is ready to uphold any deed attributed\r\n     to these images, is rather incredulous about miracles\r\n     recorded in favor of Spanish cutthroats. See _Chimalpain_,\r\n     _Hist. Conq._, i. 283 et seq. ‘Si no oviéssemos miedo de\r\n     esse del caballo blanco, ya vosotros estaríedes coçidos,’\r\n     cried some, _Oviedo_, iii. 511, while the more valiant added\r\n     that ‘con todo esto si no soltays a Motecçumacin, y os vays\r\n     luego, presto sereys muertos.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 152.\r\n\r\n     [745] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 127. Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     101-2, says seven, two having been taken alive. ‘Mataron\r\n     a Peña, el querido de Motezuma,... Valdibia, y Juan Martin\r\n     Narizes.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. vii.\r\n\r\n     [746] ‘Tuvieron guerra con los yndios en esta Cibdad dos\r\n     medios dias que fueron jueves e viernes.’ ‘Guerra casy dos\r\n     dias.’ _Lopes_ and _Flores_, in _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra\r\n     Alvarado_, 131, 134. ‘Dieron bateria los Mexicanos á los\r\n     Españoles siete dias, y los tuvieron cercados veinte y tres\r\n     dias.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, 29. ‘Cercados los españoles\r\n     ocho dias.’ _Id._ (ed. 1840), 105. ‘Pelearõ y combatieron\r\n     la casa diez dias arreo.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 151.\r\n     Torquemada explains this by assuming two days of fighting\r\n     and eight days of close siege, with attacks upon all who\r\n     sallied, i. 490. Sahagun states that Itzquauhtzin, governor\r\n     of Tlatelulco, accompanied Montezuma to the roof and spoke\r\n     to the people, representing that the Spaniards, as the\r\n     mightier race, would inflict great injury on them unless they\r\n     ceased to fight, and that the emperor would be murdered. The\r\n     Mexicans responded with insults and missiles, but as the\r\n     soldiers interposed their shields no harm was done. They\r\n     appear to have stopped active operations, however. _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, 28-9. The insults and missiles belong no doubt to\r\n     the later siege under Cortés. Duran states, however, that\r\n     Montezuma was henceforth looked on as an accomplice of the\r\n     Spaniards, and discarded as a ruler, it being resolved\r\n     to kill him and his family. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 463.\r\n     According to Oviedo the news came at this time of the\r\n     victory over Narvaez, ‘é Monteçuma mandó á los indios que\r\n     dexassen de pelear é dexassen venir los otros chripstianos,\r\n     porque á todos juntos matassen; é aquesto se cree que fué su\r\n     intento.’ iii. 512. That he may have urged this with intent\r\n     or as a bait is not unlikely, but it should apply equally\r\n     to Narvaez’ men, since it appears that their defeat could\r\n     not yet have been known. When known, however, it must have\r\n     had its effect. ‘Quando supieron nuestra vitoria, cessarõ\r\n     de dalle guerra.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 101. Yet\r\n     Gomara writes that on learning of the large forces coming\r\n     against them, the besiegers resumed the attack at one time.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 151.\r\n\r\n     [747] This spring was rediscovered during the reign of\r\n     Viceroy Revilla Gigedo. _Bustamante_, _Mem. Piedad Mex._, 7.\r\n     A pool of sweet water was the chief inducement for founding\r\n     the city on this site in 1325. _Native Races_, ii. 559-61;\r\n     v. 345 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [748] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 126. The Spanish messenger from\r\n     Mexico returned wounded. _Peter Martyr_, dec. v. cap. v.\r\n     With him, or about the same time, arrived four chiefs sent\r\n     by Montezuma to complain that Alvarado had attacked the\r\n     nobles without cause. While defending themselves six soldiers\r\n     had fallen. Cortés told the chiefs with stern countenance\r\n     that he was returning to investigate the matter. A letter\r\n     was sent to Alvarado enjoining him to guard the emperor\r\n     closely. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 101.\r\n\r\n     [749] And the zealous aid of Velazquez de Leon, who did so\r\n     much toward securing the Goazacoalco command for Cortés when\r\n     Narvaez sent letters to win it over. _Cortés_, _Residencia_,\r\n     i. 409; ii. 6, 31, 165-6. He is accused by his enemies of\r\n     impiety and licentiousness, and as one whom the general\r\n     favored above more worthy men. Solis assumes that Sandoval\r\n     nominally retained the command of the coast province, Rangel\r\n     being merely his lieutenant. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 108.\r\n\r\n     [750] ‘Llegò aquel dia [the first] à la Rinconada, el segundo\r\n     caminò siete Leguas ... llegò à Tlaxcalla à diez y siete de\r\n     Junio.’ _Torquemada_, i. 492. Herrera tells a long story of\r\n     suffering from hunger and thirst during the march through\r\n     the desert. Marquez and Ojeda were sent ahead to Tlascala\r\n     for supplies, and came back with 1200 carriers laden with\r\n     fowl, bread, fruit, and other refreshments. Cortés, among\r\n     others, was found starving, and a number were discovered on\r\n     the road almost dead. All, it seems, were rescued. dec. ii.\r\n     lib. x. cap. vii. There are several reasons for believing\r\n     that Herrera, who is somewhat confused about this period,\r\n     has confounded the present march with the flight from Mexico\r\n     to Tlascala of a month later, when the people were really\r\n     starving. This seems confirmed by the erroneous statement\r\n     that the troops arrived at Tlascala July 17th, the time,\r\n     according to Herrera’s own later statement, when they reached\r\n     that place after the flight. The account also intimates\r\n     that the starving army was met among the Otomí settlements,\r\n     where food could readily be obtained, without the necessity\r\n     for Marquez and Ojeda to go ten leagues farther, to the\r\n     capital, to obtain it. These and other discrepancies are\r\n     overlooked by all who refer to the march. Prescott dwells\r\n     in particular on the suffering from thirst, forgetful of\r\n     the statement on a previous page that the rainy season\r\n     had begun about three weeks before, and that water must\r\n     have been abundant along the whole route. Solis finds that\r\n     the effeminate followers of Narvaez endured the suffering\r\n     remarkably well. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 109.\r\n\r\n     [751] ‘Embiò a fray Bartolome de Olmedo ... a Motezuma.’\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. vii. It is unlikely that\r\n     so valuable a man would have been sent while affairs were\r\n     threatening.\r\n\r\n     [752] Narvaez landed with about 900 soldiers, including 80\r\n     horsemen, 120 with bows, and 80 with fire-arms. A number\r\n     had been picked up at Cozumel, but an equal proportion\r\n     perished by shipwreck. Cortés had about 250 men, and 200\r\n     were probably left on the coast, of garrison, guards, and\r\n     invalids. To the 950 soldiers thus taken may be added at\r\n     least 150 from the crews of the dismantled or destroyed\r\n     vessels. Prescott manages to mysteriously increase the horses\r\n     and projectile arms beyond what he previously assigns to\r\n     Narvaez and Cortés. One thousand infantry, 100 horsemen,\r\n     and many allies, say Gomara and Herrera. The _Probanza de\r\n     Lejalde_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 425, indicates\r\n     80 horses. Bernal Diaz places the figures as high as 1300\r\n     soldiers, including 96 or 97 horsemen, 80 archers, 80\r\n     musketeers, and 2000 Tlascaltec warriors; while Cortés,\r\n     with a prudent desire to cover the subsequent losses at\r\n     Mexico, reduces them to 500 infantry and 70 cavalry. Solis\r\n     gives the reason of the profound historian for the small\r\n     number of allies taken to Mexico: ‘Por no escandalizar á\r\n     Motezuma, ó poner en desesperacion á los rebeldes.’ _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, ii. 111.\r\n\r\n     [753] The arrival at Tezcuco is evidence enough that a more\r\n     northern road was taken than the one previous. The middle\r\n     route by Telapon appears somewhat more direct for Mexico,\r\n     but requires a detour to reach the Acolhua capital, and it\r\n     is not likely that an army in hurried march could afford\r\n     to go out of its way. Hence the Calpulalpan road must have\r\n     been followed.\r\n\r\n     [754] See _Native Races_, ii. 162-3, 168-73, 569; v.,\r\n     passim; _Motolinia_, _Hist. Ind._, 181-3.\r\n\r\n     [755] Cortés writes that he was on the point of sending\r\n     a Spaniard to Mexico with Tezcucan rowers, a chief being\r\n     taken as hostage, but just then came this canoe. _Cartas_,\r\n     127.\r\n\r\n     [756] Two, named Santa Clara and Pedro Hernandez, says\r\n     Herrera, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. vii.\r\n\r\n     [757] ‘Parò en Tepeaquilla, lugar a legua de Mexico.’ _Id._\r\n     Now the shrine of Guadalupe. Prescott assumes that the\r\n     Iztapalapan road was taken, as before, but it was avoided\r\n     probably because Cortés feared the fort Xoloc, which guarded\r\n     the centre. It was also longer, and had more movable bridges\r\n     than the other causeways.\r\n\r\n     [758] ‘Riñas por San Iuan pazes para todo el año.’\r\n     _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 139. The following\r\n     day a dress was found hanging from a beam, and in a square\r\n     a pile of bread, with over 500 fowl, without a guard. This\r\n     Cortés considered less favorable, and said ‘que serian riñas\r\n     de por San Iuan.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. vii.-viii.\r\n\r\n     [759] ‘Para dar á entender con esto que ellos estaban de\r\n     guerra y muy ofendidos de los españoles que él habia dejado.’\r\n     _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 108. His account\r\n     of deserted streets, applied to Cortés’ first arrival in\r\n     Mexico, belongs no doubt to this occasion. Duran argues\r\n     that had the massacre taken place before Cortés’ arrival he\r\n     would not have been allowed to enter. _Hist. Ind._, MS.,\r\n     ii. 470. Equally in the dark is Acosta, who assumes that\r\n     the Indians were openly at war, but the custom being to\r\n     rest every fourth day, Cortés managed to enter during the\r\n     cessation of hostilities. _Hist. Ind._, 522. Oviedo looks\r\n     on the non-resistance of the Indians as a wile to entrap\r\n     all the Spaniards. iii. 510.\r\n\r\n     [760] Herrera writes amusingly that Cortés shouted before\r\n     the closed gates, ‘Open!’ ‘Who is there?’ demanded Alvarado.\r\n     ‘I,’ replied Cortés. ‘Do you come with full liberty, and\r\n     power to command, as before?’ ‘Yes, and with victory, and\r\n     greater forces.’ Alvarado thereupon opened, kissed his\r\n     hand, and surrendered the keys! dec. ii. lib. x. cap. viii.\r\n\r\n     [761] ‘Con que aventuró la mayor parte de sus fuerzas.’\r\n     _Solis_, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 120. Or perhaps because he had\r\n     not had recourse to some safer measure, such as arresting\r\n     the leaders of the proposed plot, for hostages. ‘Le dixo\r\n     muy enojado, q̄ era muy mal hecho, y grande desatino, y poca\r\n     verdad ... no le hablò mas en ello.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 102. Cortés would hardly have told him that he\r\n     lied, since his statements were confirmed by so many; they\r\n     certainly were years after. Vetancurt supposes that Cortés\r\n     told him he should have allowed the emperor to attend the\r\n     festival, and should have awaited the attack rather than\r\n     opened the war. _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 140. ‘Dissimulo por\r\n     no enojar a los que lo hizieron.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     151.\r\n\r\n     [762] Solis supposes, however, that the two met in friendly\r\n     intercourse, and takes Bernal Diaz and Herrera to task for\r\n     asserting the contrary. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 112-14. He refers\r\n     to Cortés’ friendly message from Tezcuco, which is doubtful,\r\n     and to Gomara, who certainly allows Cortés to refer to\r\n     Montezuma and his courtiers as ‘dogs.’ _Hist. Mex._, 153.\r\n     In the testimony during Cortés’ residencia the discourtesy\r\n     is asserted. _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. 42 etc. Clavigero\r\n     suggests ‘ch’era d’uopo il far sembianza di credere il Re\r\n     colpevole dell’inquietudine.’ _Storia Mess._, iii. 121.\r\n\r\n     [763] _Native Races_, ii. 134-6; v. 462-4; ‘Il y\r\n     joignait, comme de coutume, la charge du grand prêtre de\r\n     Huitzilopochtli.’ _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._,\r\n     iv. 309. Gomara assumes that Cortés orders a chief to open\r\n     the market. He, offended at the insults used, goes only to\r\n     rouse the people. _Hist. Mex._, 153. Ixtlilxochitl supposes\r\n     that the chief is offended at the reprimand administered for\r\n     delaying to open the market. _Hist. Chich._, 301. ‘Mandò\r\n     Hernando Cortes llamar a los mas principales caualleros,\r\n     hizoles vna larga platica diziẽdo, que les perdonaua lo\r\n     passado, con que para adelãte fuessen ... amigos: ... sin\r\n     responder ... se fueron.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap.\r\n     viii.\r\n\r\n     [764] Duran enumerates some of the provinces summoned, as\r\n     Xilotepec and Matlaltzinco. ‘Mandó llamar á ... Encantadores\r\n     y Hechiceros para que los asombrasen y los mostrasen algunas\r\n     visiones de noche, ... para que alli muriesen de espanto.’\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 462-6.\r\n\r\n     [765] Cortés describes first a brief attack, then a sally,\r\n     succeeded by a fresh assault on the fort, while Bernal Diaz\r\n     and Herrera let a force advance against the Indians before\r\n     they reached the palace. I follow Cortés as the chief guide,\r\n     because his account of all this period was written while\r\n     quite fresh in his mind, and appears the most sensible and\r\n     correct, while the other versions depend more or less on\r\n     faint recollection and hearsay. Cortés as a rule did not\r\n     wait till the enemy approached, but he may not have been\r\n     prepared for the sudden attack. Yet it is probable that\r\n     he wished in his report to lay the responsibility of the\r\n     attack upon the enemy. I do not think Cortés inclined to\r\n     misrepresent in general or without an object.\r\n\r\n     [766] For war customs see _Native Races_, ii. 400-32.\r\n\r\n     [767] ‘Sinistræ manus digitis duobus mutilis.’ _Peter\r\n     Martyr_, _De Insvlis_, 5. Cortés also says ‘quedé manco,’\r\n     _Cartas_, 142, 131, yet Cano ridicules the statement, and\r\n     declares ‘nunca fué manco dellos ni le faltan.’ _Oviedo_,\r\n     iii. 551-2.\r\n\r\n     [768] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 128-9. Bernal Diaz speaks of\r\n     a sally by Ordaz, with 400 men, before the natives reach\r\n     the fort. He is sorely beset, as related, and retires with\r\n     a loss of 23 soldiers. _Hist. Verdad._, 102-3. Herrera’s\r\n     account, as usual, is confused. After Rio returns wounded\r\n     to report the uprising of warriors, five horsemen rally to\r\n     reconnoitre. The following day Ojeda and Marquez set out to\r\n     forage, and come to announce the approach of assailants. Two\r\n     hundred men now make a sortie and kill a multitude without\r\n     losing a man. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. viii. It is useless to\r\n     follow this author here except for incidents.\r\n\r\n     [769] Bernal Diaz places the dead at 35 soldiers, besides a\r\n     large number of allies. Eight fell during the first discharge\r\n     upon Ordaz’ party and fifteen more before he regained the\r\n     fort, while of the 46 wounded among the garrison twelve\r\n     died. _Hist. Verdad._, 103. Cortés, with his usual prudent\r\n     suppression of evil news, allows four deaths and over 80\r\n     wounded. He never refers to those who die of wounds. Gomara\r\n     follows him. _Hist. Mex._, 153.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nFIGHT UPON THE TEMPLE SUMMIT.\r\n\r\nJUNE, 1520.\r\n\r\n     THE NATIVES CONTINUE THE ASSAULT—THEIR FIERCE BRAVERY—THE\r\n     SPANIARDS BUILD TURRETS—STILL THE MEXICANS PROVE TOO STRONG\r\n     FOR THEM—MONTEZUMA CALLED TO INTERCEDE—HE IS INSULTED AND\r\n     STONED BY HIS SUBJECTS—CORTÉS ATTEMPTS EGRESS BY THE TLACOPAN\r\n     CAUSEWAY—FAILURE OF ESCOBAR TO TAKE THE PYRAMID—CORTÉS GAINS\r\n     THE SLIPPERY HEIGHT—THE GLADIATORIAL COMBAT THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt dawn the assault was renewed with the same fierceness as before,\r\nand with even less regard for the sweeping volleys of the cannon,\r\nwhich were fired without aim into the packed masses of the natives,\r\nbringing them down by the score. The gaps were quickly closed, and\r\nthe rapidly repeated shots seemed to make no more impression on the\r\nsurging mass than pebbles dropped into the boiling surf. It was a\r\ncritical time for Cortés, who seemed not yet to recognize the full\r\nextent of the danger. He felt the necessity of open communication with\r\nthe mainland, for obvious reasons, and to this end, in the course of\r\nthe morning, he arranged another sortie like that of the preceding\r\nday, but in one direction only. The Indians retired, as before, into\r\nlanes and buildings, and beyond canals, raising; the bridges behind\r\nthem. Barricades having been thrown up to impede the advance since\r\nthe last sally, some guns were brought to the front, and with their\r\naid a few of the obstructions were demolished and more than one\r\nbridge was gained, together with a number of houses, to which the\r\ntorch was applied. The discharges from the roofs were kept up with\r\ngalling pertinacity, although the effect was not so fatal as during\r\nthe preceding day, owing to the experience then gained. The forces\r\nbelow, who had retired before the charges of the advance, rolled back\r\nlike recurring billows, and in ever increasing number, upon flank and\r\nrear, as if to overwhelm them. Such were their numbers and stubborn\r\nrecklessness that ten thousand Hectors and Rolands, says Bernal Diaz,\r\ncould have effected nothing against them, and soldiers from the Italian\r\nwar swore that never among Christians or Turks had they witnessed such\r\nfierceness. Considerable alarm was also created by the appearance\r\nof long pikes, like those of the Chinantecs, directed particularly\r\nagainst the cavalry. Fortunately they were not numerous, nor were\r\nthe pikemen sufficiently practised to be very dangerous. Worn out in\r\nthe unequal contest Cortés turned to gain his camp, which was no easy\r\ntask, since the natives were massed in greatest number in the rear,\r\ndetermined to cut off retreat. The fort was gained, nevertheless,\r\nalthough hardly a man escaped uninjured, while about a dozen were\r\nkilled; one unfortunate soldier being captured and sacrificed in full\r\nview of the garrison.[770]\r\n\r\nIt had been found that the greatest danger to the sallying parties came\r\nfrom the roofs, whence discharges could be directed with comparative\r\nimpunity and with greater effect than from the ground. In order to\r\ncounteract them, three _mantas_, or movable turrets, were planned,\r\nwhose occupants were to devote their attention wholly to clearing\r\nthe roofs of assailants. The completing of these machines and other\r\npreparations kept the garrison busy all the 27th of June, so that\r\nno sally was made. Ascribing this to fear, the Indians became more\r\npressing in their assault, and more profuse with their insults.\r\n“Dogs!” cried some, “of hunger and thirst shall you die!” Others\r\nshouted, “Here is a piece of my tortilla!” at the same time flinging\r\nthem unpalatable fragments of toasted bread. “Eat it, you perjured\r\nvillains, who can fight only on the backs of animals; for soon shall\r\nyour own bodies be cut up for food and cast before the beasts!” The\r\nenemy appeared more numerous than ever, and the roofs and yards were\r\nliterally covered with their missiles. The greatest danger to the\r\nSpaniards lay in the operations of the battering and mining parties,\r\nwho, regardless of bullets from the wall turrets, sought steadily to\r\nopen fresh breaches. Conspicuous in the hostile camp was a richly\r\ndressed Indian, surrounded by a staff of finely attired warriors,\r\nwho seemed to direct operations, and whose orders were received with\r\nthe deepest reverence. This personage the prisoners declared to be\r\nCuitlahuatzin, and the next in rank Quauhtemotzin.[771] Charge after\r\ncharge was made by his direction, and with a vehemence that threatened\r\nto carry everything before it; and loudly rang the yells, whether of\r\ndelight at some advantage gained or of fury over a repulse.\r\n\r\nThus the besieged were harassed beyond endurance. Large numbers were\r\nwounded, and all were exhausted from vigils, hard fighting, trying\r\nwork, and the want of sufficient water and food; for in view of the\r\nstoppage of supplies, rations had been reduced. Those of the Narvaez\r\nexpedition were particularly disheartened, and bestowed freely their\r\nmaledictions, first on Velazquez, who had sent them to such a country,\r\nand then upon Cortés, whose promises of golden treasures and well\r\nstocked encomiendas had lured them to this plight. Perceiving, however,\r\nthat unity of purpose alone could save them, they stifled regrets\r\nand showed Cortés that something must immediately be done to stay the\r\nonslaught, lest the building fall about their ears. It was exceedingly\r\ndisagreeable, but it must be done; the proud Spanish general must\r\nsue to the greatly injured captive king, pleading for his influence\r\nin behalf of peace.[772] Montezuma had all these days been closely\r\nconfined to his rooms brooding over the insults offered him, and\r\napparently indifferent to the danger from without. When the message\r\nwas brought he sullenly said, “Why does Malinche address himself to\r\nme, who care no longer for life? I will not listen to him, for he it\r\nis who has brought me into this plight.” He intimated further that the\r\npromises of the general could not be relied upon, and that his words\r\ncarried a double meaning. Olmedo and Olid, who had come to urge the\r\nrequest, had recourse to soothing words and persuasion, and succeeded\r\nin mollifying him somewhat.[773] He replied, however, that it was\r\nprobably too late to appease the Mexicans by promises. “They have now\r\na new leader,” he said, “who is resolved to spare no Spaniard, and\r\nI believe that you have all to die in this city.”[774] Nevertheless\r\nhe yielded, and as befitted the momentous point at issue, he arrayed\r\nhimself in the richly bejewelled robes of state, and placed upon his\r\nhead the mitred _copilli_, beneath whose precious feathers gleamed\r\nthe golden plate.[775] Carefully guarded he ascended to the roof and\r\nstepped to the parapet, preceded by a courtier who bore the triple\r\nwand of the empire, as was customary on such occasions. Instantly\r\nthe tumult was hushed, even before the leaders could issue orders\r\nfor a stay of hostilities; instantly a thousand heads were bent in\r\nhumble adoration before the august majesty of their sovereign. This\r\nattitude, however, was assumed but for a moment; soon these same heads\r\nwere held higher than ever. Then the chiefs drew near to listen to\r\nthe unhappy monarch.\r\n\r\nMontezuma had appeared with a feeling of mingled fear and doubt as to\r\nwhat his reception might be, and he did not fail to observe that the\r\naccustomed reverence was shown only for an instant, involuntarily,\r\nas it were, and that silence was prompted rather by curiosity than\r\nrespect. The urgency of the moment demanded that he should speak, but\r\nit was rather as supplicant than ruler that he turned to his people.\r\n\r\n“You are in arms, my children,” he said, “in hot battle. Why is this?\r\nYou will be slain, and there will be heard throughout the land for\r\nmany years the wail of wives and little ones. You would give me my\r\nliberty, and I thank you. You do not turn from me in anger, and I\r\nthank you. You have not chosen another king in my stead, and I thank\r\nyou. Such an act would displease the gods, and bring destruction on\r\nall. And see! I am no prisoner. Go your way; I am free. By divine\r\ncommand I must remain the guest of the Spaniards yet a little longer,\r\nand you must not molest them, for soon they will return whence they\r\ncame. Alas, my people, my country, my crown!”[776]\r\n\r\nWith a heavy sigh, and midst copious tears, his head fell on his\r\nbreast. The monarch’s strength had indeed departed. The people knew\r\nthat he spoke falsely, that he was little better than imbecile, unfit\r\nto be their sovereign. Oh, if he but had the good fortune to die while\r\nhelping them to grind to powder these hated enemies! Only a little\r\nwhile ago his words would have been received as the utterances of a\r\ndeity. Now the scales had fallen from their eyes, and they saw him as\r\nhe was. They could bear no more. Jeers and groans reached him from\r\nevery direction. “Coward! chicken! Woman to the Spaniards, fit only\r\nfor the gown and the spindle! Murderer of your nobles!” Such were the\r\ncries which now reached his ears as he stood stupefied with agony.\r\nPresently came a shower of arrows and stones, and before the Spanish\r\nguard could interpose their shields several missiles struck him, one\r\non the left temple, which caused him to fall senseless into the arms\r\nof the by-standers.[777]\r\n\r\nStartled by the crime they had committed, awe fell upon the multitude\r\nas the stricken sovereign was led away. Taking advantage of this\r\nfeeling Cortés beckoned the chiefs to a parley with a view to explain\r\nwhat Montezuma had intended to convey. He had always wished them\r\nwell, he said, and felt grieved to wage war for what had occurred\r\nduring his absence. He desired peace, yet the desire was not prompted\r\nby fear, but by consideration for their safety and that of the city.\r\nThe chiefs replied that the Spaniards must leave the country to the\r\nnatives, and depart at once. That was exactly what they wished to do,\r\nreplied Cortés, but they would not be driven away. If the Mexicans\r\ndesired them to go, they must abandon the siege, tear down the\r\nbarricade, and retire to their homes; they must likewise restore the\r\nbridges and supply provisions. To this the chiefs declined to listen,\r\ndeclaring that they would not lay down their arms so long as there\r\nwas a Spaniard left on whom to use them.[778] The evident desire of\r\nthe besieged for peace served only to encourage the Indians, and the\r\nassault was renewed with an increased ardor that taxed the defenders\r\nto the utmost.\r\n\r\nAnd now, whatever the cost, a way out of this place must be opened.\r\nCortés knew of three causeways which led to the mainland, the only\r\nmeans of exit for his forces. He knew that they were low and narrow,\r\nexposed on both sides to the attacks of canoe fleets, and intersected\r\nby a number of bridges which were perhaps by this time raised. Each of\r\nthese openings was an almost impassable chasm. The southern causeway\r\nto Iztapalapan was two leagues in length, and provided with seven\r\ndrawbridges, besides a strong fortress, which rendered it impassable\r\nto an enemy. The northern, leading to Tepeyacac, was one league long,\r\nwhile the shortest, conducting westward to Tlacopan, half a league\r\ndistant, was broken by only three bridges.[779] Cortés resolved to\r\nundertake the passage by this last named causeway. During the night\r\nhad been completed three mantas, of light framework and planks, each\r\nto hold twenty musketeers and archers, with which it was hoped to\r\ncheck the assailants on the roofs. These mantas were built with two\r\nchambers, provided with loop-holes; the upper ranged on a level with\r\nthe house-tops of ordinary one-story buildings of the city, and had\r\ndoors, so as to allow of sallies upon the roofs.[780]\r\n\r\nThe following morning, June 28th, Cortés placed himself at the head\r\nof five hundred Spaniards and over three thousand allies, and took\r\nthe direction of the Tlacopan causeway.[781] By a sudden charge the\r\ncavalry drove back the Indians and allowed the free passage of the\r\nmantas, which were drawn and pushed by Tlascaltecs, and protected\r\nby bodies of infantry. A corps of pioneers accompanied them with\r\npickaxes, mattocks, crow-bars, and ladders, to destroy barricades and\r\nwalls, and to scale buildings. Four cannon were also brought. The\r\nrear was protected by a portion of the cavalry. The Aztecs were at\r\nfirst amazed at the curious moving turrets, and feared that they might\r\ncontain more terrible destroyers even than the grape-charged guns;\r\nbut finding them less dangerous, they continued their efforts, and\r\nfast and thick poured the stones and arrows on the line of advance,\r\nparticularly on the engines, which were severely damaged. The march\r\nproceeded, however, with more or less interruption till a raised\r\nbridge was reached on the main road, where the Indians had gathered in\r\nvast numbers, with an evident determination to check the expedition.\r\nThe turrets were brought alongside the houses adjoining the canal in\r\norder to clear the crowded roofs, but regardless of the volleys from\r\nthe firelocks, the natives on the roofs plied their missiles only the\r\nfaster, letting fly heavy rocks[782] upon the engine coverings, so\r\nas to render them untenable and hinder the manœuvring of the cannon.\r\nThis success enabled the warriors beyond the canal and behind the\r\nbarricades to maintain their assault with great effect, and to prevent\r\na further advance. They gained a considerable advantage by a change\r\nof tactics in directing the missiles to a great extent against the\r\nlegs of the Spaniards, to their serious discomfiture.[783] After\r\nspending the greater part of the forenoon in an unsuccessful attempt\r\nto destroy the houses nearest the canal, and to fill a passage across\r\nit, the troops retired to the fort greatly disheartened. Even the\r\nTlascaltecs, who were usually so glib of tongue in replying to Aztec\r\ntaunts, for once held their peace.[784]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the battle raged fiercely round the fort. The temple in\r\nfront of it, since its evacuation by the Spaniards, had been occupied\r\nby some five hundred Mexicans, chosen men,[785] who introduced a large\r\nquantity of ammunition and supplies, and began to batter the besieged\r\nquarter. It was this shower which had first damaged the turrets and\r\nharassed the march. Perceiving the danger of leaving so commanding a\r\nposition in hostile hands, Cortés had sent his chamberlain, Escobar,\r\nwith one hundred men[786] and some allies to dispossess them. This\r\nwas no easy task, for the pyramid was of great extent and over eighty\r\nfeet in height, composed of a series of abrupt stone terraces, each\r\nreceding about six feet from the one beneath, and so arranged that\r\nthe ascent led along the entire circuit of each ledge before the\r\nsteps conducting to the next could be gained.[787] Twenty men, says\r\nCortés, could have held it against a thousand; yet the one hundred\r\nwere to attempt it. Step by step they fought their way, beneath\r\nshowers of arrows, and against javelins, and sword and lance thrusts\r\nfrom the upper ledges. More dangerous even than these weapons were\r\nthe cumbrous missiles in the shape of heavy stones and timber which\r\ncame crashing down upon them. Three times[788] did Escobar lead his\r\nmen to the charge, only to see them repulsed and sent rolling down\r\nthe steps and over the ledges. Finally he sent word to Cortés that\r\nthe task was impracticable. The general received this notice while\r\nvainly battling at the canal, and he eagerly seized upon it as excuse\r\nfor changing his base of operation. He hurried to the spot, threw a\r\ncordon round the pyramid, and although badly wounded in the left hand\r\nhe immediately led his men to the charge. The Spaniards were making\r\nfair progress, when two heavy beams, which had been reserved at the\r\nsummit for the last extremity, were loosened and sent tumbling down\r\nthe side, so directed as to sweep to destruction the assailants along\r\nits entire length. At about the centre of their terrible passage, full\r\nbefore them, stood Cortés. Immediate death for himself and his brave\r\ncomrades seemed inevitable, when behold! by some unseen finger the\r\nbeams were turned end foremost and shot harmlessly through the opening\r\nmade for them by the soldiers. “Thanks be to God and the virgin, whose\r\nimage was placed in this tower!” cried Cortés, as without the loss\r\nof a moment he sprang forward and speedily gained the summit. There\r\nthe fight assumed the form of a gladiatorial combat, a hand-to-hand\r\nand line-to-line conflict, poised in mid-air on this narrow slippery\r\nsummit, and in full view of the whole city. As if by common consent\r\nthe combatants below paused in their bloody work and stood breathless,\r\nlost in the more thrilling sight above.\r\n\r\nAt the eastern end of the platform stood the two three-story chapels,\r\nover fifty feet in height, originally dedicated to Huitzilopochtli\r\nand Tezcatlipoca. Against this the Indians had massed themselves,\r\nfierce in their desperation. The Castilians had taken their stand\r\nat the other end. It was an awful situation, dire destruction being\r\ninevitable to one side or the other. With nerves and sinews strained to\r\ntheir utmost tension, they stood between attacks regarding each other,\r\nregarding every motion, anon picking from the other’s number with\r\njavelin, dart, or musket, as they were able. It was with difficulty\r\nthe Spaniards could stand, and there was no railing round the slippery\r\nheight; but fortune again assisted by unveiling the sun and sending\r\nits blinding rays full in the face of the enemy. Every now and then\r\nthe soldiers charged in solid phalanx into the centre of the opposite\r\nmass, only to be obliged to retire under the pressure of its weight,\r\nand to receive the counter-charge, encouraged by wildly gesticulating\r\npriests, who flitted to and fro in bloody robes and dishevelled hair.\r\nAware of the inferiority of their weapons, the natives sought rather\r\nto seize hold of the Spaniards, singly or in groups, and with the\r\nrecklessness of doomed men to hurl themselves with their victims\r\nfrom the dizzy height. In one instance Cortés himself was selected\r\nfor this terrible fate. Inspired to martyrdom and revenge, two young\r\nnobles watched their opportunity, and approached him on their knees,\r\nas if pleading for mercy. Ere he had time to consider the situation\r\nthey had seized him in their arms and were struggling to gain the\r\nedge. One moment more and he would have been dashed to death, but by\r\nputting forth his whole strength, nerved by desperation, he succeeded\r\nin freeing himself from their grasp. Ojeda was singled out for a\r\nsimilar attempt, and would have perished had not a Genoese come to\r\nhis aid.[789]\r\n\r\nFor three hours the struggle lasted, while one Indian after another\r\nwas picked off by the bullet and the arrow, or pierced by the pike\r\nand sword, or sent headlong over the platform, either to be crushed\r\nby the fall or to be transfixed by the Spaniards on the ledges below.\r\nAs their number diminished, many a one sought the higher martyrdom\r\nby leaping from the sacred spot into paradise. Thus melted away that\r\nfated band of Aztec warriors. At the portal of Huitzilopochtli’s chapel\r\nfell the last defender; and two priests, one of them the high-priest,\r\nalone remained to offer themselves as captives. On entering the chapel\r\nconsecrated to the virgin no traces appeared of the holy emblems,\r\nonly evidences of idolatrous rites, and upon the altar stains from the\r\nblackened hands of the temple attendants.[790] In the adjoining chapel\r\nthe war-god was found reinstalled in all its glittering hideousness.\r\nSome consolation for this sacrilegious intrusion was offered to the\r\nvictors in despoiling it of the rich ornaments, while the cacao and\r\nother provisions stored here by the garrison proved a prize to the\r\nhalf-famished Spaniards. The Tlascaltecs, so long deprived of meat,\r\npounced upon the bodies of the slain heroes to secure them for a feast,\r\nwhich should not only satisfy the cravings of hunger, but infuse their\r\nhearts and minds with some of the qualities of the valiant dead.[791]\r\nThe chapels were then fired. The upper portion of the structure being\r\nof wood, the flames rose in columns heavenward, heralding the triumph\r\nof the Spaniard, and striking the Indian with awe. It was a great and\r\nthrilling feat, this fight upon the temple top; and so the natives\r\nregarded it, their heart, and mind, and paintings being all stained\r\nsanguine over its remembrance.[792]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [770] Bernal Diaz mentions the death of ten or twelve, but\r\n     Cortés acknowledges only three score of wounded. On this\r\n     occasion, apparently, Herrera allows Cortés to gain Tacuba,\r\n     whither he might have retreated in safety with all his forces\r\n     and wealth; yet he states that the return fight proved most\r\n     severe, the fort being regained with difficulty, after the\r\n     loss of two guns and several soldiers, one taken alive.\r\n     dec. ii. lib. x. cap. ix. Solis manages to transform the\r\n     operation into a victory, wherein Cortés stays the slaughter\r\n     out of mercy. Prescott is quite arbitrary in the use of\r\n     the chronicles. He combines the incidents of several days\r\n     into one and transposes them at pleasure, with the sole aim\r\n     apparently of presenting an exciting description of what\r\n     the siege might have been. A few facts are elaborated, and\r\n     the rest sacrificed to style.\r\n\r\n     [771] Marina asked Montezuma if a new king had been chosen,\r\n     but he did not think they would elect one while he lived.\r\n     _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 141.\r\n\r\n     [772] ‘Fue acordado de demandalles pazes para salir de\r\n     Mexico, ... acordò Cortes, que el gran Monteçuma les\r\n     hablasse.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 104. ‘Muteczuma\r\n     ... dijo que le sacasen ... y que él hablaria á los\r\n     capitanes.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 129-30. The latter statement\r\n     may be Herrera’s authority for saying that Montezuma was\r\n     the first to propose speaking to the Mexicans. dec. ii.\r\n     lib. x. cap. x. Observing Cuitlahuatzin’s regal authority\r\n     over the besieging forces, Montezuma was seized with a\r\n     fit of jealous alarm for throne and life. ‘Chiamò Cortès,\r\n     ... pregandolo instantemente di non differir più la sua\r\n     partenza.’ _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 124. This\r\n     implies that the emperor was not aware of the vain efforts\r\n     made to open communication with the mainland, or even to\r\n     approach it. Cortés had to urge him in any case to speak to\r\n     his subjects, an unwelcome task in view of his declining\r\n     influence and of the merely partial success of the former\r\n     appeal.\r\n\r\n     [773] Among other reasons it was represented that Cortés was\r\n     not to blame for the late massacre. ‘Que si la indignacion\r\n     de los mexicanos podia templarse con el castigo de los\r\n     culpados ... le prometia castigar.’ So says the native\r\n     version of _Tezozomoc_, _Recop. tradiciones_, MS., cap.\r\n     vi.; _Chimalpain_, _Hist. Conq._, 287-8.\r\n\r\n     [774] He felt no eagerness to plead in behalf of those who\r\n     had caused all his misfortunes, and he was only too conscious\r\n     that his pusillanimity must have degraded him in the eyes\r\n     of his subjects, while the elevation of his brother to the\r\n     leadership must have diminished the influence which till then\r\n     may have remained with him. He could hardly avoid a feeling\r\n     of jealousy at the thought of this elevation; and if he,\r\n     during an impulse of anger against Cortés, had counselled\r\n     the proceedings of Cuitlahuatzin, he now felt probably both\r\n     grieved and terrified at the storm he had raised. He also\r\n     harbored a wholesome fear of Malinche, and the prospect\r\n     of his speedy departure helped to stir anew the embers of\r\n     hope. All might yet be well: the capital might be spared\r\n     further desolation, and he again resume his former grandeur.\r\n\r\n     [775] See description of his first meeting with Cortés,\r\n     _Native Races_, ii. This appearance of the emperor took\r\n     place on the 27th of June, as Cortés states, but Bernal\r\n     Diaz, Herrera, and Ixtlilxochitl place it respectively on\r\n     the 5th, 6th, and 7th day of the siege.\r\n\r\n     [776] _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. x.; _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 104. ‘No molestàsen à los estrangeros\r\n     y fuésen sus amigos, pues su persona corria riesgo.’\r\n     _Tezozomoc_, _Recop. tradiciones_, MS., cap. vi. Cortés,\r\n     followed by Gomara, gives him no time to speak ere the\r\n     people assault.\r\n\r\n     [777] They would no longer recognize him as emperor, etc.\r\n     Saying this, a chief threw a stone which struck Montezuma on\r\n     the forehead. _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 468. Acosta\r\n     attributes this first throw to ‘Quicuxtemoc,’ the later\r\n     king of Mexico. _Hist. Ind._, 523. ‘Ma io nol credo,’ says\r\n     Clavigero, _Storia Mess._, iii. 126. ‘Aunque vn Castellano\r\n     tenia cuydado de arrodelar a Motezuma ... le acertò vna\r\n     piedra en las sienes.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. x.\r\n     Had not the Spaniards held up a shield before Montezuma\r\n     the people would have known it was he and not thrown the\r\n     stone which killed him, says Cano, his later son-in-law.\r\n     _Oviedo_, iii. 550. Gomara is inclined to believe this,\r\n     for his people ‘no lo quisieran hazer mas que sacarse los\r\n     ojos.’ _Hist. Mex._, 154. ‘Una saéta alcanzó al emperador\r\n     en el estòmago que lo atravezó por el baso, y una piedra\r\n     le dió en la sien izquierda.’ The people would never have\r\n     thrown missiles, for they pitied him, and were prepared\r\n     to obey his injunctions, but Cacama, who stood behind the\r\n     emperor, made signs that they should continue the attack\r\n     without regard for him or for the monarch. _Tezozomoc_,\r\n     _Recop. tradiciones_, MS., cap. vi. According to Bernal\r\n     Diaz, the four chiefs who had approached to confer with him\r\n     expressed their sympathy for his misfortunes. They had now\r\n     chosen as leader ‘Coadlabacan, señor de Iztapalapa,’ and had\r\n     sworn to the gods to continue the war till all Spaniards\r\n     were exterminated. Yet they prayed daily to the gods for\r\n     his safety, and if all went well he would more than ever\r\n     be their lord. They had hardly finished when showers of\r\n     missiles fell, of which three stones and an arrow hit him,\r\n     on the head, arm, and leg. _Hist. Verdad._, 104. ‘Remorse\r\n     succeeded to insult,’ and they fled, says Robertson, _Hist.\r\n     Am._, 90, a statement which Prescott improves by stating\r\n     that the square before the fort was left empty. But remorse\r\n     must have been brief, for the main authorities, Cortés,\r\n     Gomara, Bernal Diaz, and Torquemada, either declare or\r\n     intimate that the assault never stopped. ‘No por eso cesó la\r\n     guerra y muy mas recia y muy cruda de cada dia.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 130.\r\n\r\n     [778] ‘Esta Fortaleza casi no tiene exemplar,’ exclaims Lorenzana,\r\n     forgetting that Cortés’ firmness was due to the justifiable\r\n     fear that a trap was intended. _Cortés_, _Hist. N. España_,\r\n     136-7. Cortés concludes the sentence about Montezuma’s\r\n     being wounded by saying that he died within three days.\r\n     He thereupon resumes the account of parleys and siege\r\n     operations, leaving the impression that these took place\r\n     after his death, while such was not the case. Nevertheless,\r\n     Gomara, Herrera, and others, Bernal Diaz not excluded, are\r\n     misled, by this vagueness evidently, into extending the\r\n     siege and confounding the events, so that modern historians\r\n     have all more or less remained mystified. Solis assumes\r\n     that during Montezuma’s illness the siege was conducted\r\n     only by straggling parties, the main forces being occupied\r\n     with crowning the new emperor. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 155-6.\r\n     This is probably due to a misconstruction of Bernal Diaz.\r\n\r\n     [779] ‘En esta auia tres no mas, y en la de Yztapalapà,\r\n     siete.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xi.; _Native\r\n     Races_, ii. 561 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [780] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 130, 133. ‘Quatro ingenios ...\r\n     en que pudiessen yr veynte y cinco hombres,’ says Bernal\r\n     Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 103. ‘Tres mantas ... cõ sus ruedas;\r\n     leuauan treynta hombres a cada vna, cubierta con tablas\r\n     gruessas de tres dedos.’ _Herrera_, loc. cit. Drawn by men\r\n     within, adds Peter Martyr, dec. v. cap. v. ‘Cabia cada vno\r\n     veynte hombres, con picas escopetas y ballestas y vn tiro.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 154.\r\n\r\n     [781] Herrera unwisely assumes that the three towers with\r\n     their forces were respectively directed against the three\r\n     causeway approaches.\r\n\r\n     [782] ‘De tres y quatro arrouas, que maltrataron a los que\r\n     yuan en los ingenios, y rompieron las tablas.’ _Herrera_,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xi.\r\n\r\n     [783] ‘Hirieron a mas de docientos Castellanos.’ _Id._,\r\n     cap. ix.\r\n\r\n     [784] ‘Nos mataron un español y hirieron muchos.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 130-1.\r\n\r\n     [785] ‘Subieron allá dos vigas rollizas para desde alli\r\n     echarlas sobre las casas reales y hundirlas.’ _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist. Conq._, 30. Peter Martyr supposes the temple to have\r\n     been long held by the enemy, but this is contrary to what\r\n     Cortés and Sahagun say.\r\n\r\n     [786] Three hundred, says Gomara.\r\n\r\n     [787] For a full description of this pyramid see _Native\r\n     Races_, ii. 579 et seq. Some horses had been taken to clear\r\n     the approaches, but they slipped on the smooth pavement,\r\n     and were sent back as unserviceable. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 105.\r\n\r\n     [788] ‘Acometiola tres o quatro vezes, y otros tantos dias,’\r\n     is Gomara’s interpretation, in order to fill up the time\r\n     assumed by him. _Hist. Mex._, 156.\r\n\r\n     [789] Ojeda appears to be the sole authority upon which\r\n     Herrera relies for these two struggles. dec. ii. lib. x.\r\n     cap. ix. Clavigero doubts them; yet there is nothing unlikely\r\n     in either attempt.\r\n\r\n     [790] It was related afterward that when the natives\r\n     first sought to remove the virgin image their hands clove\r\n     powerlessly to it for some time, and left their marks\r\n     upon it. _Oviedo_, iii. 510. Montezuma, being told of\r\n     this miracle, ordered the image to be left in its place.\r\n     Afterward, ‘pareciò, segun supimos, que el gran Monteçuma\r\n     tenia ó deuocion en ella, ó miedo, y la mandó guardar.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 104, 102. Others, as will\r\n     be shown, suppose it to have been saved by its owner,\r\n     Villafuerte, perhaps when Cortés withdrew the troops from\r\n     the temple, or to have fled by its own miraculous power to\r\n     the shrine at Remedios.\r\n\r\n     [791] ‘Comierõ de los caualleros Mexicanos muertos.’\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. ix.\r\n\r\n     [792] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 130-1. According to Bernal Diaz\r\n     the sally with the engines was directed against the temple,\r\n     which he appears to place at some distance. It was held by\r\n     3000 or 4000 Indians, ‘all chiefs,’ and cost the Spaniards\r\n     46 lives, every man being beside wounded. They returned\r\n     hard pressed by the enemy. ‘Se mostrò Cortes mui varõ, como\r\n     siẽpre.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 103-4. ‘Murieron todos quinientos\r\n     Indios, como valientes.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 157. ‘En\r\n     trecientos caualleros que alli estauan no quedaron seys\r\n     viuos.’ _Herrera_, loc. cit. This author describes on a later\r\n     occasion the capture of a tower attached to Montezuma’s own\r\n     palace, from which missiles fell with telling effect. Cortés\r\n     goes with 200 men to reduce it, and is hotly received; yet\r\n     the Indians, relying upon the execution to be made by some\r\n     loose beams which are to be rolled down upon the assailants\r\n     at a favorable moment, allow the Spaniards to rush forward\r\n     and gain the tower, putting almost every occupant to the\r\n     sword. This story is probably a version of the temple fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF MONTEZUMA.\r\n\r\nJUNE, 1520.\r\n\r\n     A LIVING DEATH—THE OLD IMPERIAL PARTY AND THE NEW POWER—AZTEC\r\n     DEFIANCE—PERILOUS POSITION OR THE SPANIARDS—DISAPPOINTMENT\r\n     TO CORTÉS—ANOTHER SALLY—THE DYING MONARCH—HE HAS NO DESIRE\r\n     TO LIVE—HIS REJECTION OF A NEW FAITH—HE WILL NONE OF THE\r\n     HEAVEN OF THE SPANIARDS—COMMENDS HIS CHILDREN TO CORTÉS—THE\r\n     CHARACTER OF MONTEZUMA AND OF HIS REIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before this the Spaniards had learned that the power which had\r\narisen in Montezuma’s stead was of a different quality from that lately\r\nwielded by the poor caged monarch, whose proud spirit they had so\r\nblighted and brought low. No Quetzalcoatl or other personage, fair or\r\ndark, heaven-descended or of import infernal, might now interpose to\r\nprevent the killing and cooking of the strangers. Cortés had thought\r\nthat the late spoliation of idols would fill the people with awe\r\ntoward beings so superior to their gods. But when he threatened that\r\nif they did not lay down their arms not a man of them should remain\r\nalive, nor one stone be left on another throughout all their city, they\r\nlaughed at him, the priests abetting. “How speak you so foolishly,”\r\nthey said, “mortal as we now know you to be, when for every Spanish\r\nlife we are prepared to sacrifice, if need be, twenty-five thousand\r\nof our own lives?” They had cut off retreat at the causeways, so that\r\nthe lake alone was open to exit, and here they were prepared with\r\nfleets of canoes filled with resolute men. Even should the Spaniards\r\nhold out against assault, hunger and thirst must overcome them in\r\nthe end. “The truth of this was too evident,” observes Cortés, “for\r\nhunger alone would have soon killed us.”\r\n\r\nThe imperial party, which had sunk to insignificance since the\r\nelevation of Cuitlahuatzin to the leadership, and was now sustained\r\nonly by a few relatives of Montezuma, had no longer a voice in the\r\ndirection of affairs. Their efforts to make terms with the Spaniards\r\nmight have gained public approval, but the ambition of Cuitlahuatzin\r\nstood in the way of any compromise. To release the strangers would be\r\nto restore Montezuma, and he preferred to occupy the throne himself.\r\nHe was also covetous of military fame; and knowing the desperate\r\ncondition of the besieged, he hoped by their reduction to add to his\r\nrecord of glorious achievements.[793]\r\n\r\nThe soldiers felt the peril of their position more than the general.\r\nThey had been cheered for a moment by victory, only to find how barren\r\nit was; only to realize that many such triumphs would prove their ruin.\r\nIn order to counteract this growing despondency, Cortés resolved on\r\na night sally with half his force. The Indians being unprepared for\r\nthis, the party advanced with comparative impunity, destroyed several\r\nbarricades, and fired a large number of houses along the Tlacopan\r\nroad, where the roof assault had been so severe. The warriors having\r\nfinally gathered in sufficient force to render retreat advisable, the\r\nSpaniards destroyed a number of buildings in the vicinity of their\r\nquarters before entering, and thus secured additional immunity.[794]\r\n\r\nThe present purpose of the Spaniards was to open an exit from the\r\ncity. At a council, called to consider the situation, it was admitted\r\nthat delay would only reduce their strength without corresponding\r\ngain, and with the prospect of closing more effectually the gate\r\nagainst them.[795] It was a great disappointment to Cortés thus to\r\nabandon his hard-earned advantage. There were those who would exult\r\nover his misfortunes, and never could he hope to win favor from the\r\nking except by some brilliant success. But this he would yet achieve,\r\nGod willing, or perish in the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe engines were strengthened, and every preparation was made to meet\r\nthe rapidly accumulating difficulties. At dawn a large force set out in\r\nthe direction of the Tlacopan causeway to secure its approaches.[796]\r\nThe advance was made in the order of the day previous, with guns and\r\npioneers, and with cavalry in front and rear. The late destruction\r\nof houses proved of no considerable advantage, but the cannon being\r\nbrought to play on the barricades, an opening was soon made. The\r\nengines, with their fortified sides and covers, proved more efficient\r\nthan formerly in checking assaults from the roofs. The soldiers\r\naccordingly advanced with firmer resolution, and although the showers\r\nfrom the house-tops were still troublesome, and resistance on the\r\nstreets was as fierce as ever, yet one after another the first four\r\ncanals were captured. The nearest houses were razed, and with the\r\ndébris roadways were thrown across the channels.\r\n\r\nThese operations were carried on in the face of a bitter onslaught,\r\nand occupied the entire day. Evening being at hand the crossings were\r\nleft in charge of a strong guard, composed of the freshest men, while\r\nthe rest returned to the fort.\r\n\r\nMontezuma the while lay a-dying, prostrate a-dying, not as Vespasian\r\nwould have an emperor die—standing; but with manhood, and the\r\naspirations of man, ay, even the regrets and remorse incident to\r\nfoiled endeavor, all crushed he was killed when the insults of his\r\npeople fell upon him; he scarcely heeded their darts and stones.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary always that breath shall cease before one can be\r\ndead. From Ianthe’s spirit fell the shackles of sense, the body being\r\nleft with its animal life, but soulless. And though corporal life was\r\nyet present in Montezuma, the soul was already free: the accursed\r\naliens had done their worst. When the might of sacred sovereignty\r\nwas extinguished, the remains were less than man, though they walked,\r\nand talked, and wept.\r\n\r\nCompared with his present condition, how dignified and happy death\r\nwould have been by the hands of his brother priests, before the gods,\r\nin the eyes of the nation, on the sacred sacrificial stone! Or, like\r\nthat among the Massagetæ, told of by Herodotus, who sacrificed and\r\nate their old people, holding natural death a misfortune—even this\r\nor any other stepping down and out would have been preferable to thus\r\ndying like a silly hare in a trap!\r\n\r\nHe refused food and any attention to the wounds, which were far\r\nfrom fatal. He tore off the bandages, threw from him all medicines,\r\nand bared his body to disease, even as his soul had been long since\r\nbared, and stretched out his hand to hasten the cold stony grasp of\r\ndeath. What a farce was life, and honor, and majesty, all to end in\r\npoverty and disgrace! Feeling the all-changing moment at hand, he\r\nsummoned Cortés; for despite his long maltreatment he entertained\r\na kind of affection for the monster, who might even yet prove to be\r\nthe demi-god of some far away incomprehensible world. Moreover, the\r\nSpaniard’s intellect and arm were the stronger; he was his son-in-law\r\nand probable successor; therefore, though his jailer, he would speak\r\nwith him. And when he came Montezuma said: “The end for me approaches,\r\nMalinche; it is even here. You cannot harm me further, nor help me\r\nif you would. I have given you all; you have taken all—my liberty, my\r\nkingdom, my life, and that which is more to me than kingdom, liberty,\r\nor life, the affection of my people, the love of my counsellors and\r\nfriends; and respect—respect of self, and that sacred respect which,\r\nliving or dead, is mine by inheritance, and by virtue of my office.\r\nBut I would not upbraid you; I pray only that my ruin will benefit\r\nyou; I beg of you care for my children, and I conjure you to avenge\r\nme on my rebel subjects and their leaders.”[797]\r\n\r\nMoved by the touching appeal, Cortés promised all that was asked of\r\nhim, while remonstrating with the monarch for rejecting food and\r\nmedicine. Montezuma then, in like manner, exhorted his nobles who\r\nwere prisoners with him, and was touched by their sorrow for the\r\nsad state of the empire, and their manifestation of affection for\r\nhimself. Father Olmedo, who had never relaxed his efforts for the\r\ncaptive’s conversion, now pressed to his aid the general. But in vain.\r\nAll else these beings maledict had taken from him; they should not\r\nnow rob him of his religion. His faith was as dear to him, as true,\r\nas pure, as efficacious, as was theirs to them. Away with another’s\r\ngods! Let each live and die by his own. He was high-priest, too, and\r\nfor him to prove recreant to the national faith would overshadow\r\nall his former crimes combined. “What is this they would have of\r\nme?” he groaned within himself. Then turning suddenly to Olmedo, he\r\nasked, “Do Spaniards go to this heaven of yours?” “Assuredly,” was\r\nthe reply; “it was made for them, and is held by Christians, against\r\nall others, as the reward of their pure belief and gentle deeds.” “It\r\nis enough; I will none of it,” said Montezuma, who from that moment\r\nwould not listen to a word of Christian exhortation.[798] It was early\r\nin the morning of the 30th of June,[799] three days after the trying\r\nscene in the presence of his people, that the monarch breathed his\r\nlast. And even the Spaniards forgot for a moment their diabolisms,\r\nand allowed their minds to dwell on the virtues of this magnificent\r\nheathen, this mighty sovereign, their sweet-tempered prisoner, and\r\nkind and generous host.[800]\r\n\r\nOf a truth, despite his pusillanimity with regard to the Spaniards,\r\nwhich was indeed little else than pardonable superstition, this man was\r\nin many respects not unworthy the title of Great so freely bestowed\r\nupon him. Montezuma was but forty-one[801] at the time of his death,\r\nand had wielded the sceptre for nearly eighteen years with wonderful\r\nsuccess. Under him the Aztec empire acquired its widest extent and\r\ngreatest glory. While his armies by well directed operations spread\r\nthe terror of his name to distant provinces and increased the national\r\ndomain by fresh conquests, his subtle intrigues secured advantages\r\nat home, and established the supremacy of Mexico in the tripartite\r\nalliance. With a high regard for the dignity of his throne, he caused\r\nthe sovereign to be worshipped almost like a god, and sustained the\r\ngrandeur of his surroundings with lavish expenditure. This severe and\r\nostentatious pride kept him above the reach of his people, and failing\r\nto understand their wants or to sympathize with their condition, he\r\nruled not by love, but by fear. Thus it is that we find the native\r\nrecords dwell upon his fitful cold-blooded cruelty and superstition,\r\nnot as a tyrant, however, but as an administrator of their own cruel\r\nyet revered rites. He was reputed just, but this quality was to be\r\nfound rather in the intention than in the act. With all his pride\r\nhe appears to have been most affable and kind to those with whom\r\nhe came in contact. The Spaniards certainly found him so. In their\r\nlater intercourse other considerations may have ruled him, however,\r\nand with the cunning and secrecy of his race he may have submitted\r\nto the inevitable demands of circumstances.[802]\r\n\r\nSurrounded by fawning ministers, whose existence depended on his favor,\r\nhe was encouraged in the extravagant habits of a magnificent court,\r\nwhich promoted their schemes at the expense of a tax-ridden people.\r\nThe ambition to extend his fame and power required the maintenance of\r\nimmense armies, of numerous garrisons, and of costly campaigns, which\r\nproved another drain on the people. This was augmented in subjected\r\nprovinces by the extortions of imperial officers, who found means to\r\nprevent the cry of the oppressed from reaching the throne. Perhaps the\r\nmost terrible infliction was the levy on the youth of both sexes for\r\nslaves, and for sacrificial victims to appease the bloody appetite of\r\nAztec gods—an appetite which had increased in horror with the abject\r\nsuperstition of this otherwise enlightened monarch. Enlightened he\r\nundoubtedly was, for as high-priest he had become versed in the higher\r\nlearning of the priesthood. The study of mythology came naturally\r\nto him, while astronomy and natural history were favorite subjects\r\nwith the lords of the lake peoples, the former connected with myths\r\nand divinations, the latter illustrated by specimens from different\r\nregions, and collected in the botanic and zoologic gardens of Mexico\r\nand other cities. The studies of his youth had gained for him a well\r\nmerited respect from his priestly confrères, and the prudence and\r\nsagacity which controlled the well stored mind commanded attention\r\nin the council.[803] While yet a young man there seemed to develop\r\nqualities which fitted him for the position of high-priest, also as\r\ncounsellor, to which his princely rank paved an easy way. Besides this\r\nhe had shown himself possessed of great courage, and had established\r\nhis fame as a general by many victories.\r\n\r\nIt was with this reputation, as zealous and learned priest, prudent\r\nstatesman, and brave soldier, that he ascended the throne in 1503,\r\nwhile only twenty-three years of age. It is in such terms that his\r\ncolleague Nezahualpilli in his coronation address refers to the hopes\r\nentertained of the youthful ruler.[804] Though ever a devout servant\r\nof the gods, the effeminate pleasures of the court weakened the nerves\r\nand energy of the soldier, till his warlike ardor survived only in\r\na taste for military reviews and for the chase. The caution of the\r\ngeneral remained, but timidity saves few leaders from disaster. Vanity\r\nand designing ministers overruled too often the dictates of wisdom\r\nin the administration of affairs.[805] His path had been prepared by\r\nable predecessors, and answered well for the policy of aggrandizement\r\nwhich became the leading feature of his reign. In this his natural\r\nliberality and talent for intrigue, fostered by priestly training,\r\nserved him well and procured blindly devoted instruments for his plans.\r\nThus, by fair means and foul, the empire was raised to the pinnacle\r\nof its glory, but not being of a natural or healthy growth it proved\r\nunstable, and crumbling under the strong commotion created by the\r\napproach of Castilians, it revived only for a moment in the present\r\nuprising like the mental illumination preceding death. Montezuma could\r\nnot have failed to recognize the insecurity of the bonds which held\r\nit, and influenced by the predictions of its downfall he readily fell\r\nbeneath the spell of the superior intellects which were to assume\r\ncontrol. It was his misfortune to have lost the sanguine energy of\r\nhis youth, which might have enabled him to rise above the weaknesses\r\nof himself and his age. Duty and honor were overcome by superstition\r\nand absorbing love of power, of life, and he reaped the natural fruit\r\nof puerile and misdirected efforts by losing both. Resistance might\r\nnot long have delayed the inevitable, but it would at least have\r\nprocured for him an end worthy of his grandeur.\r\n\r\nOf his many wives may be named the princesses Teitlalco, Acatlan,\r\nand Miahuaxochitl, of whom the first named appears to have been the\r\nonly legitimate consort.[806] By her he left a son, Asupacaci, who\r\nfell during the _noche triste_, and a daughter, Tecuichpo, baptized\r\nas Isabel, married consecutively to Quauhtemotzin, the last Mexican\r\nsovereign, to visitador general Alonso Grado, to Pedro Andrade Gallego,\r\nand to Juan Cano de Saavedra. She had children by the latter two,\r\nfrom whom descend the illustrious families of Andrade-Montezuma and\r\nCano-Montezuma.\r\n\r\nBy the Princess Acatlan were left two daughters, baptized as María\r\nand Mariana. The latter alone left offspring, from whom descends the\r\nSotelo-Montezuma family. By the third wife came to the emperor the\r\nson Tlacahuepantzin, known after baptism as Pedro Yohualicahuacatzin\r\nMontezuma, whose descendants, the condes de Montezuma y de Tula,\r\nintermarried with the noblest families of Spain, and connected the name\r\nwith the highest offices of state, and with the title of grandee.[807]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [793] In _Manuscrit de 1528_, _Aubin Col._, Cihuacohuatl\r\n     and Tzihuacpopocatzin, brothers of Montezuma, are named as\r\n     the leaders of the opposition party, connected also with\r\n     the followers of Quetzalcoatl, who abhorred the cruel rites\r\n     of the Aztecs. They succeeded, it is said, in introducing\r\n     provisions for the besieged. _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist.\r\n     Nat. Civ._, iv. 317-18. But this is doubtful.\r\n\r\n     [794] This is probably the sally which Herrera intrusts to\r\n     Salcedo. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. viii.\r\n\r\n     [795] ‘Por importunidad de muchos ... acordó de salir della.’\r\n     _Carta del Ejército_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i.\r\n     429. ‘El ... capitan dilataba de cada dia la dicha salida,’\r\n     but the officers insisted that he should leave. _Segunda\r\n     Probanza de Lejalde_, in _Id._, 423.\r\n\r\n     [796] Clavigero directs the operation against the Iztapalapan\r\n     road, which would have been a useless manœuvre. Cortés is\r\n     explicit enough on the point.\r\n\r\n     [797] In a _privilegio_ in favor of the daughter Isabel,\r\n     Cortés refers to this interview, saying that three daughters\r\n     were intrusted to him. No allusion is made to any son. The\r\n     affectionate terms in which he herein speaks of Montezuma\r\n     must be due to political reasons, and perhaps to a regard\r\n     for the princesses. _Panes_, _Vireyes_, in _Monumentos\r\n     Domin. Esp._, MS., 67-8. Ramirez ridicules the idea of an\r\n     appeal by the emperor to Cortés, who was on unfriendly terms\r\n     with him. _Soc. Mex. Geog._, _Boletin_, x. 359 et seq. But\r\n     the effort of Montezuma to save the Spaniards shows that\r\n     intercourse had been reëstablished; and was not Cortés,\r\n     as the husband of one or more of his daughters, the proper\r\n     person to protect their sisters?\r\n\r\n     [798] The question of his conversion has been much discussed.\r\n     ‘No le pudo atraer a que se bolviesse Cristiano,’ says\r\n     Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 105; and Herrera is even\r\n     more explicit. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. x. Cortés and his\r\n     followers, Martyr and Oviedo, give no indications to the\r\n     contrary. Ixtlilxochitl states, however, that he had learned\r\n     several prayers, and even begged for baptism, but that the\r\n     rite was deferred ‘por la pascua siguiente, que era de la\r\n     resurreccion, y fue tan desdichado, que nunca alcanzó tanto\r\n     bien.’ _Hist. Chich._, 299. Yet he adds that it has been said\r\n     ‘que se bautizó y se llamó Don Juan.’ _Relaciones_, 457.\r\n     According to Gomara he asked for baptism in the beginning\r\n     of lent, but it was determined to postpone the rite till\r\n     pentecost, for greater effect, and as more appropriate\r\n     for so high a personage. Owing to the troubles arising out\r\n     of Narvaez’ arrival nothing was done then, ‘y despues de\r\n     herido oluidose con la prissa del pelear!’ _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     154. Cortés had persuaded him, says Vetancurt, during the\r\n     early days of his imprisonment, to accept baptism, and he\r\n     was taken to the temple for the purpose, but at the last\r\n     moment he excused himself on the ground that the Indians\r\n     would elect another lord and attack them all if he abandoned\r\n     the faith. _Teatro Mex._, iii. 132-3. Father Duran, on the\r\n     contrary, ever zealous for the natives, and particularly\r\n     for his hero, Montezuma, asserts that trustworthy men had\r\n     vouched for his baptism. Padre Olmedo had also expressed\r\n     belief therein, although he had not been present when it\r\n     was administered. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 445. The father’s\r\n     memory must have failed him with respect to Olmedo. Camargo\r\n     has also been assured of his baptism, with Cortés and\r\n     Alvarado for sponsors. _Hist. Tlax._, 166. Tezozomoc, who\r\n     claims to have investigated the point, declares explicitly\r\n     that the rite was administered on his death-bed, when he\r\n     received the name of Cárlos, and that Cortés, Olid, and\r\n     Alvarado were the sponsors. _Recopilacion de verídicas\r\n     tradiciones, probando que el emperador Moteuhsoma recibió\r\n     el santo sacramento del bautismo._ This author wrote at\r\n     the close of the sixteenth century, and follows traditions\r\n     only. Bustamante, in modern times, has also reviewed the\r\n     question, and follows Tezozomoc implicitly. In support\r\n     thereof he quotes a poem, by Captain Angel Betancourt,\r\n     wherein he refers to Montezuma as the ‘indio _bautizado_,’\r\n     introduces the vague utterance of Ixtlilxochitl, and even\r\n     attempts to misconstrue a certain expression of Cortés.\r\n     Montezuma tells the latter to baptize his daughters, and\r\n     this Bustamante regards as proof that he himself desired the\r\n     rite. He does not suppose that the religion of the vicious\r\n     Spaniards could have had great attractions for him, but when\r\n     about to die he accepted it, ‘as the drowning man does the\r\n     saving plank.’ Article in _Chimalpain_, _Hist. Conq._, i.\r\n     287-95. Still fuller is the review of Ramirez, who follows\r\n     Torquemada in pointing out the fact that neither Cortés\r\n     nor Alvarado ever referred to their supposed sponsorship,\r\n     as they certainly would have done in connection with so\r\n     distinguished a personage had they felt empowered. _Soc.\r\n     Mex. Geog._, _Boletin_.\r\n\r\n     [799] Cortés’ chronology, as indicated in the _Cartas_, shows\r\n     clearly that he left Mexico during the night of June 30th,\r\n     as will be demonstrated. He also implies what Bernal Diaz\r\n     and Herrera distinctly assert, that considerable fighting\r\n     took place on the Tlacopan road between the time the corpse\r\n     was surrendered to the Aztecs and the Spaniards returned to\r\n     their quarters preparatory to evacuation. Hence the death\r\n     must have occurred early on that day. Herrera confirms\r\n     Cortés’ testimony that he could not have died before the\r\n     30th, by saying, ‘en quatro dias se murio.’ dec. ii. lib.\r\n     x. cap. x. It is also generally admitted that he was not\r\n     wounded before the third day of the siege.\r\n\r\n     [800] ‘Cortes lloró por èl, y todos nuestros Capitanes, y\r\n     soldados: è hombres huvo entre nosotros ... que tan llorado\r\n     fue, como si fuera nuestro padre.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 104. Cortés speaks highly of him, ‘y siempre tuvo\r\n     mui buena voluntad á los Españoles,’ but this is in the deed\r\n     presented to his daughter. See _Privilegio_, _Monumentos\r\n     Domin. Esp._, MS., 66. In the Cartas he is referred to\r\n     merely as a captive who dies. After saying that he never\r\n     consented to the death of a Spaniard nor to injury against\r\n     Cortés, Gomara adds: ‘Tambien ay quien lo cõtrario diga.’\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 154-5.\r\n\r\n     [801] Clavigero says 54, but Bernal Diaz, who was so much\r\n     in his company, could hardly have been mistaken, and the\r\n     comparative youth of his children also indicates that 41\r\n     is more correct.\r\n\r\n     [802] ‘Antes ni despues huvo en este mundo quien le\r\n     igualase en magestad y profanidad ... fue muy justiciero\r\n     ... de condicion muy severo, aunque cuerdo y gracioso.’\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 301. ‘Dizen los Indios\r\n     que fue el mejor de su linaje, y el mayor rey de Mexico.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 155. ‘Fu circospetto, magnifico,\r\n     liberale ... sua giustizia degenerava in crudeltà.’\r\n     Clavigero, _Storia Mess._, iii. 132; _Herrera_, dec. ii.\r\n     lib. x. cap. x.; _Torquemada_, i. 499-500.\r\n\r\n     [803] ‘Fue muy sabio, pues passaua por las cosas assi,\r\n     o muy necio q̄ no las sentia.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     155. ‘El hombre mas sábio de su siglo,’ is Bustamante’s\r\n     interpretation. He also discovers that Montezuma objected\r\n     to sacrifices! _Chimalpain_, _Hist. Conq._, 292-3.\r\n\r\n     [804] See _Native Races_, ii. 149-50.\r\n\r\n     [805] ‘Pareva aver cangiato di sesso, siccome dicevano i\r\n     suoi sudditi.’ _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 132.\r\n\r\n     [806] So Cano, the son-in-law, declares, _Oviedo_, iii.\r\n     549, and so Cortés intimates in the _privilegio_ to Isabel,\r\n     whom he calls ‘su legitima heredera,’ especially commended\r\n     to him.\r\n\r\n     [807] Of the rest of the imperial wives and concubines\r\n     nothing positive is known, save that a number of them\r\n     and their daughters were liberally bestowed, as a mark\r\n     of imperial favor, on prominent personages, including\r\n     Spaniards. After the conquest they sank into obscurity,\r\n     although some of them still managed to maintain a certain\r\n     consideration among the natives, despite their poverty.\r\n     Bernal Diaz claims that he received one of the concubines;\r\n     upon Olid was bestowed a daughter, and upon Cortés two,\r\n     it is said, one baptized as Ana, the other as Inés. Two\r\n     witnesses declare that Isabel also ‘cinco meses questava\r\n     casada con ... Gallego e que pario una fija y que hera del\r\n     ... Cortés.’ _Cortés_, _Residencia_, ii. 242, 244; i. 63,\r\n     99, 221, 263. The three daughters confided to Cortés on\r\n     their father’s death-bed were not in the Spanish quarters\r\n     at the time, at least not all of them, but were found after\r\n     the conquest and baptized. The eldest and legitimate,\r\n     the attractive Tecuichpo, was then the wife of the last\r\n     and captive sovereign, Quauhtemotzin, her cousin, who had\r\n     married her chiefly with a view to strengthen his hold on\r\n     the throne, for she was too young for the married state.\r\n     She was baptized as Isabel, and her Indian husband having\r\n     been executed, Cortés, on his return from Honduras, gave\r\n     her in marriage to the hidalgo Alonso Grado, of Alcántara,\r\n     who had succeeded Ávila as contador, and now held the\r\n     position of visitador general of New Spain. In consideration\r\n     partly of Grado’s services and partly of Isabel’s rank, the\r\n     captain-general bestowed as dower, in the emperor’s name,\r\n     the town of Tacuba (Tlacopan), with the villages and farms\r\n     subject to it, together with the title of señora thereof.\r\n     The deed, which recounts the services of her father and the\r\n     intrusting of his daughters to Cortés, is signed by him as\r\n     captain-general and governor of New Spain, and dated June 27,\r\n     1523. It is given, among other books, in _Monumentos Domin.\r\n     Esp._, MS., 65-8. Grado dying soon after, without issue,\r\n     she married Pedro Andrade Gallego, by whom she had one son,\r\n     Juan Andrade, the founder of the Andrade-Montezuma family.\r\n     This branch inherited the Villa Alta villages, in Oajaca,\r\n     and other estates, which in 1745 were bought up by the\r\n     crown for a pension of 3000 pesos, continued by the Mexican\r\n     government in irregular payments. A member of this branch\r\n     was the bishop of Chiapas a few years later. _Certificacion\r\n     de las Mercedes_, MS., 14-18. M. Fossey describes a visit,\r\n     in 1849, to the poverty-stricken yet proud descendants.\r\n     _Mexique_, 497-500. The omission of Gallego’s middle name\r\n     has led the critical Alaman, among others, to assume that\r\n     this family descends from Isabel’s fifth marriage with\r\n     Juan Andrade. _Prescott’s Mex._ (Mex. 1844), ii. 31. Nor\r\n     is Prescott free from error in connection with Montezuma’s\r\n     descendants. The Andrade branch became allied to the Condes\r\n     de Miravalle, and a daughter of this house was the wife of\r\n     General Barragan, who became _presidente interino_ of the\r\n     republic, thus raising a descendant of Montezuma once again\r\n     to the supreme place in the country. The Princess Isabel\r\n     was married a fourth time, to Juan Cano de Saavedra, by\r\n     whom she had five children, the inheritors of the Tacuba\r\n     estates, also exchanged for a pension which was continued\r\n     by the republic. Of the Princess Acatlan’s two daughters,\r\n     María and Mariana, the former left no issue. Mariana\r\n     married the conquistador Juan de Paz, bringing a dower of\r\n     three towns, and after his death she took for husband the\r\n     conqueror Cristóbal de Valderrama. By him she had a daughter,\r\n     Leonor, who, marrying Diego Arias Sotelo, gave origin to\r\n     the Sotelo-Montezuma family. _Fonseca_, _Hist. Hacienda_,\r\n     i. 464. This work, with its collection of official papers\r\n     and extracts, gives a mass of information about the imperial\r\n     descendants and estates. Prescott confounds the mother and\r\n     daughter. _Mex._, ii. 351-2. Viceroy Mendoza, in a despatch\r\n     to the emperor of December 10, 1537, refers to the death,\r\n     three weeks before, of Valderrama, and speaks of children\r\n     by the former husband, which are not admitted in Fonseca.\r\n     _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, ii. 208. Cortés\r\n     refers to three sons of Montezuma: the heir, who fell on\r\n     the causeway during the _noche triste_, and two surviving\r\n     boys, ‘one said to be insane, the other paralyzed.’ On\r\n     leaving Mexico he took with him one son and two daughters,\r\n     his concubines probably, all of whom perished. _Cartas_,\r\n     135, 153. Sahagun names two sons, who perished on that\r\n     occasion. _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 122, 126. Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     gives them different names. _Hist. Chich._, 302. Cano gives\r\n     the name Asupacaci to the heir, or only legitimate son, the\r\n     brother of his wife Isabel, and states that he was killed\r\n     by Quauhtemotzin, who feared him as the only rival to the\r\n     throne. _Oviedo_, iii. 549. Brasseur de Bourbourg follows\r\n     him, but prefers the name of Cipocatzin for the young\r\n     prince, while Axayoca is also applied. Cortés’ version is\r\n     more likely to be correct, however. One of the surviving\r\n     sons, ‘Signor di Tenajoccan,’ _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._,\r\n     iii. 133, was baptized with the intervention of his sponsor,\r\n     Rodrigo de Paz, and died three years after the conquest,\r\n     ‘y se enterrò en la Capilla de San Joseph.’ _Vetancvrt_,\r\n     _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 144. This author assumes that the\r\n     youth fled with the Spaniards from the capital and hid at\r\n     Tepotzotlan. The other prince, son of Miahuaxochitl, daughter\r\n     of the lord of Tula, and niece of Montezuma—baptized as\r\n     María, says Vetancurt—received the name of Don Pedro. He\r\n     accompanied Cortés to Spain in 1528, it appears, at the\r\n     age of eighteen, and made repeated appeals to the emperor\r\n     for a maintenance in accordance with his rank. At first\r\n     some trifling favors were granted, and he, together with a\r\n     cousin, was educated by the Franciscans in Madrid. _Puga_,\r\n     _Cedulario_, 85. President Fuenleal, of the audiencia, and\r\n     other prominent persons having added their recommendation,\r\n     regular pensions and encomiendas were bestowed, including\r\n     the town of Tula, the seat of his maternal grandparents,\r\n     upon which was based the second title of Condes de Montezuma\r\n     y de Tula, conferred on his grandson. The line expired on\r\n     the male side with the great great-grandson of the emperor,\r\n     whose daughter married Sarmiento de Valladares, duke of\r\n     Atlixco, and viceroy of New Spain, thus raising the name\r\n     again to the highest position in the country. Prescott,\r\n     following Humboldt, _Essai Pol._, i. 191, 203, calls\r\n     Valladares, by mistake, a descendant of Montezuma. The\r\n     cousin of the vice-queen married Silva, the first marquis\r\n     of Tenebron, whose descendants inherited the title and\r\n     estates from the other branch, and became grandees in 1765.\r\n     Their pension amounted at this time to 40,000 pesos, says\r\n     Berni, _Titulos de Castilla_, which represented in part\r\n     the encomiendas withdrawn by the government. The republic\r\n     recognized this portion, as it had the pensions to the\r\n     other branches. Shortly after the independence of Mexico the\r\n     holder of the title, Alonso Marcilla de Teruel Montezuma,\r\n     came over with the intention of asserting his claim to the\r\n     throne of his forefathers, but the prudent possessors of\r\n     the power thought it best not to admit him, and he passed\r\n     on to New Orleans, there to put an end to his life some\r\n     years later. Prescott understands that the septuagenarian\r\n     had been disappointed in love. _Mex._, ii. 352. Several\r\n     members of the Spanish nobility have intermarried with\r\n     this line, among them a branch of the Guzman family, whence\r\n     the claim made for the consort of Napoleon III. of having\r\n     Montezuma’s blood in her veins. Gondra gives a portrait\r\n     of a member married into the Mendoza family. _Prescott’s\r\n     Mex._ (ed. Mex. 1845), 219. One of the line, Padre Louis\r\n     de Montezuma, wrote the _Historia del Emperador_, which\r\n     has been consulted by Alaman, _Disert._, i. app. ii. 158.\r\n     Clavigero gives a genealogic table in _Storia Mess._, iii.\r\n     235, and Carbajal, while plagiarizing the statements and\r\n     blunders of others, adds a few of his own. _Hist. Mex._, ii.\r\n     378-88. In _Fonseca_, _Hist. Hacienda_, i. 455 et seq., are\r\n     to be found several valuable extracts concerning titles and\r\n     estates; also in _Reales Cédulas_, MS., i. pt. i. 5, ii.\r\n     4 etc.; _Certificacion de las Mercedes_, MS.; _Mex. Mem.\r\n     Hacienda, 1848_, 35-6; _Fuenleal_, _Carta_, in _Pacheco_\r\n     and _Cárdenas_, _Col. Doc._, xiii. 222. The family name has\r\n     been spelled in different ways, also by its possessors, as\r\n     Motezuma, Muteczuma, Moctezuma, Mocthecuzoma, Motecuhzuma,\r\n     Moteuhzuma; but Montezuma is the most common form.\r\n\r\n     The _Historia de las Indias de Nueva-España y Islas de Tierra\r\n     Firme_, by Father Diego Duran, is claimed by its author, in\r\n     the introductory to chapter lxxiv., to be devoted essentially\r\n     to the life and rule of this monarch, ‘cuya vida é história\r\n     yo escribo.’ The preparation of the work was more directly\r\n     prompted by a compassion for the maltreated natives, whose\r\n     champion he constituted himself, in common with so many\r\n     of the friars. This spirit led him naturally to color the\r\n     occurrences of the conquest; and a non-critical acceptance\r\n     of whimsical legends and statements in favor of his protégés\r\n     tends further to reduce the value of the work. His deep\r\n     interest in the aborigines and their history may be explained\r\n     by the fact that he was born at Tezcuco, of a native mother.\r\n     Franco wrongly calls him Pedro, and Clavigero, Fernando. He\r\n     professed as a Dominican at Mexico, in 1556, with missionary\r\n     aspirations, no doubt, but a delicate constitution and\r\n     constant suffering confined him rather to the monastery, and\r\n     directed his efforts to researches and writing. Castellanos,\r\n     _Defensa_, 28, attributes several works to him, and Eguiara,\r\n     _Bib. Mex._, 324, the compilation of the Dominican history\r\n     of Dávila Padilla, though not the style and form. Dávila\r\n     also, ‘scrisse la Storia antica de’ Messicani, servendosi\r\n     de’ materiali raccolti già da Ferdinando Duran Domenicano\r\n     da Tezcuco; ma questa opera non si trova.’ _Clavigero_,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, i. 13. But this may be a mistake. A similar\r\n     rewriting would have greatly improved the _Historia de las\r\n     Indias_, which is exceedingly unpolished and slovenly,\r\n     full of repetitions and bad spelling, and showing great\r\n     poverty of expression. On the other hand, it is relieved by\r\n     an admirable portrayal of character and knowledge of human\r\n     nature, and by a minute study of the effect of conversion\r\n     on the natives. The work consists of three tratados, the\r\n     first in 78 chapters, giving the history of Mexico from its\r\n     origin to the conquest, terminating with the expedition\r\n     to Honduras. This was completed in 1581, while the other\r\n     two were finished two years before. The second tratado, in\r\n     23 chapters, treats of Mexican divinities and rites, and\r\n     the third, in two, or more properly nineteen, chapters, of\r\n     calendar and festivals. Padre Duran died in 1588, leaving\r\n     the manuscripts to Juan Tovar, _Dávila Padilla_, _Hist.\r\n     Fvnd. Mex._, 653, who gave them to Acosta, then occupied\r\n     in preparing his _Natura Novi Orbis_, and other works. The\r\n     contribution came most opportunely, and was used chiefly for\r\n     his account of Mexico, as he frankly admits, though giving\r\n     the credit to Tovar, who may have claimed the authorship.\r\n     On the strength of this statement Clavigero, with others,\r\n     confirms the claim to the ‘nobilissimo Gesuita Messicano.’\r\n     Torquemada, i. 170-1, ii. 120, himself not spotless, takes\r\n     advantage of the confession to rail at Acosta for borrowed\r\n     plumage, mutilated at that. The manuscripts, now in the\r\n     Biblioteca Nacional de Madrid, are written in double columns\r\n     and illustrated with numerous plates. Pinelo, _Epitome_,\r\n     ii. 711, refers to them as in two parts. A few copies have\r\n     been taken, mine forming three volumes. A set obtained by\r\n     José Fernando Ramirez, one of Maximilian’s ministers, was\r\n     prepared by him for publication, but, owing to the death of\r\n     the imperial patron, only the first 68 chapters were issued\r\n     at Mexico, 1867, in one volume, with notes and considerable\r\n     changes of the style. This mutilation, as some term it, may\r\n     have been a reason for the seizure of the whole edition,\r\n     together with the separate plates, by the republican\r\n     government. Only a few copies escaped this fate, one of\r\n     which I succeeded in obtaining. Although independent issue\r\n     was long withheld from Duran, he has at least enjoyed the\r\n     honor of being associated with one possessed of far greater\r\n     fame than he himself could ever hope to achieve.\r\n\r\n     The motives which impelled Joseph de Acosta to write on\r\n     America were quite pretentious. Among the many Spanish\r\n     books on the New World, he says: ‘I have not seene any\r\n     other author which treates of the causes and reasons of\r\n     these novelties and wonders of nature, or that hath made\r\n     any search thereof. Neither have I read any booke which\r\n     maketh mention of the histories of the antient Indians,\r\n     and naturall inhabitants.’ With a view to repair these\r\n     omissions he issued _De Natvra Novi Orbis libri dvo, et de\r\n     Promvlgatione Evangelii, apvd Barbaros, sive de Procvranda\r\n     Indorvm Salvte Libri sex._ Salmanticœ, 1589. The first\r\n     part, _De Natura_, is a philosophic dissertation on physical\r\n     features, on the probable knowledge among the ancients of\r\n     a western hemisphere, and on the origin of the Indians.\r\n     The second part, in six books, bearing a separate imprint\r\n     under 1588, though published only in connection with the\r\n     previous two books, treats entirely of the method and\r\n     progress of Indian conversion. The _Natura_ was translated\r\n     into Spanish, and incorporated, with some amendments, in the\r\n     _Historia Natvral y moral de las Indias_, Sevilla, 1590,\r\n     dedicated to Infanta Isabel, which treats also of Indian\r\n     history and customs, and refers briefly to the conquest.\r\n     The work achieved great success, and was reproduced in\r\n     numerous editions, in nearly every language, though often\r\n     without Acosta’s name, and in distorted form, as in De\r\n     Bry and some German versions. This may not be considered\r\n     bad treatment by those who charge Acosta with plagiarism,\r\n     although he frankly admits following a number of authors,\r\n     among them ‘es vno Polo Ondegardo, a quien communmente\r\n     sigo en las cosas de el Piru: y en las materias de Mexico\r\n     Ioan de Touar prebendado que fue de la Iglesia de Mexico,\r\n     y agora es religioso de nuestra Compañia de Iesvs. El qual\r\n     por orden del Virrey hizo dõ Martin Enriquez diligẽte, y\r\n     copiosa aueriguaciõ de las historias antiguas.’ See p. 396.\r\n     There is no doubt that the interest and value of the work\r\n     are owing chiefly to the circumstance that the original\r\n     authorities have remained sealed, until lately at least;\r\n     for, despite its pretentious aim, the pages are marred by\r\n     frequent indications of the then prevalent superstition\r\n     and credulity. The _Procvrando Indorvm Salvte_ is more in\r\n     consonance with the character of the Jesuit missionary and\r\n     scholastic.\r\n\r\n     Born at Medina del Campo about 1539, he had in his fourteenth\r\n     year joined the Society, to which four brothers already\r\n     belonged. After studying and teaching theology at Ocana,\r\n     he proceeded in 1571 to Peru, where he became the second\r\n     provincial of his order. Returning to Spain seventeen years\r\n     later—‘post annos in Peruano regno exactos quindeciem, in\r\n     Mexicano & Insularibus duos,’ says the dedication of 1588\r\n     to Philip II., in _De Natvra_ of 1589—he gained the favor\r\n     of the king, occupied the offices of visitador and superior,\r\n     and died as rector at Salamanca, February 15, 1600. Several\r\n     other works, in print and manuscript, chiefly theologic,\r\n     are attributed to him—see _Camus_, 104-13—among them _De la\r\n     criança de Cyro_, dedicated to Filipe III. in 1592, which\r\n     was also a borrowed text, from Xenophon, and remained a\r\n     manuscript in the Royal Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nLA NOCHE TRISTE.\r\n\r\nJUNE 30, 1520.\r\n\r\n     THE CAPTIVE-KING DRAMA CARRIED TOO FAR—BETTER HAD THE\r\n     SPANIARDS TAKEN MONTEZUMA’S ADVICE, AND HAVE DEPARTED WHILE\r\n     OPPORTUNITY OFFERED—DIPLOMATIC VALUE OF A DEAD BODY—NECESSITY\r\n     FOR AN IMMEDIATE EVACUATION OF THE CITY—DEPARTURE FROM THE\r\n     FORT—MIDNIGHT SILENCE—THE CITY ROUSED BY A WOMAN’S CRY—THE\r\n     FUGITIVES FIERCELY ATTACKED ON ALL SIDES—MORE HORRORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now what must have been the feelings of the invaders, who, like\r\nthe ancient mariner, had killed the bird that made the breeze blow!\r\nFor assuredly they were responsible for the emperor’s death. Indeed,\r\nthe direct charge of murder against Cortés has not been wanting, even\r\namong Spanish chroniclers; but this was owing greatly to the effort\r\nof the general to extricate the army from its desperate situation\r\nwhile the enemy was supposed to be distracted by grief and engaged in\r\nsolemn obsequies. We may be sure, however, that the Spaniards did not\r\nkill Montezuma; that they did not even desire his death; but regarded\r\nit at this juncture as the greatest misfortune which could happen\r\nto them.[808] For in the vast evolvings of their fast, unfathomable\r\ndestiny, they were now all like sea-gulls poised in mid-air while\r\nfollowing a swiftly flying ship.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the manœuvring on both sides over the dead\r\nmonarch, who having ministered so faithfully to his enemies while\r\nliving, must needs continue in the service after death. The hostile\r\nchiefs were called and informed of the sad consequences of their\r\noutrage on the emperor. The body would be sent to them, so that they\r\nmight accord it the last honors. The leaders replied curtly that\r\nthey had now a new chief, and cared no longer for Montezuma, dead or\r\nalive. The corpse was nevertheless carefully arrayed in fitting robes\r\nand given in charge of two prisoners, a priest and a chief,[809]\r\nwith instructions to carry it to the Mexican camp, and explain the\r\ncircumstances of the death and the grief of the Spaniards. On appearing\r\noutside the fort a leader motioned them back, and would probably\r\nhave used force but for the priestly character of the bearers, behind\r\nwhom the gate had been closed. A few moments later they disappeared\r\nfrom view. The disrespect shown the living was not spared the dead.\r\nAs the corpse was borne through the streets jeers and insults fell\r\nfrom lips which formerly kissed the ground on which the monarch had\r\nstood. Many declared that a coward like Montezuma, who had brought\r\nso many misfortunes on the country, was not worthy of even ordinary\r\nburial.[810] The imperial party managed, however, to secure the body,\r\nand, assisted by those to whom the royal blood and high priestly\r\ncharacter of the deceased outweighed other feelings, an honorable\r\nthough quiet cremation was accorded in the Celpalco, where Sahagun\r\nintimates that the ashes remained.[811]\r\n\r\nShortly after the body had left the Spanish quarters Cortés sent a\r\nfresh message to the Mexicans, believing that by this time the presence\r\nof the august dead might have had its effect on them. He pointed\r\nout the respect due to the remains of a sovereign, and proposed a\r\ncessation of hostilities with that view, and till they had elected\r\na successor, one more worthy than the present leader, who had driven\r\nthem to rebel.[812] The chiefs replied that the Spaniards need trouble\r\nthemselves about nothing but their own safety. They might come forth,\r\nthey added tauntingly, to arrange a truce with their new leader, whose\r\nheart was not so easily moulded as that of Montezuma. Respect for\r\nthe emperor, the Spaniards replied, had made them hitherto lenient\r\ntoward his people, but if they remained obstinate no further mercy\r\nwould be shown, and not one Mexican would be spared. “Two days hence\r\nnot one Spaniard will be alive!” was the retort.\r\n\r\nHostilities were thereupon resumed, and Cortés did not delay the\r\nprearranged attempt to complete the capture of the approach to\r\nTlacopan. The presence of the imperial corpse had either a retarding\r\ninfluence on the movements of the enemy, or else the Spaniards sallied\r\nunexpectedly and fought with greater energy, for the four remaining\r\nbridges were gained with little difficulty, and twenty horsemen passed\r\non to the shore, while the infantry and allies took possession of the\r\nroute, and began filling in the channels with débris, so as to form\r\na solid path, or to repair the bridges at the deeper places. At this\r\ntime a messenger arrived with the announcement from the chiefs who\r\nwere directing the siege of the fort that they were willing to treat\r\nfor peace. Leaving the forces in charge of Velazquez, Cortés hurried\r\nwith some horsemen to answer the welcome summons. The chiefs proposed\r\nthat if pardon was granted them for past offences they would raise\r\nthe siege, repair the bridges and causeways, and return to peaceful\r\nintercourse. In order to arrange the conditions they demanded the\r\nliberation of the captured high-priest. This was at once agreed to,\r\nand after some discussion messengers were despatched to different\r\nparts of the city, bearing orders, it was said, to stay hostilities.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat singular that the astute Cortés should have given\r\nsuch ready credence to proposals so advantageous to himself. Yet this\r\nappears to have been the case. Delighted with the happy adjustment of\r\naffairs, he ordered prepared a grand supper; but he had hardly seated\r\nhimself at table before tidings reached him that the Mexicans had\r\nreturned to the attack on the causeway, largely reinforced by land and\r\nwater, and were regaining the bridges taken that day. The conference\r\nhad been a ruse to throw the Spaniards off their guard, to obtain the\r\nrelease of the high-priest, from whom besides much information was\r\nexpected about the condition of the besieged, and to gain time for\r\nbringing up reinforcements.[813] Fearful that his retreat would yet\r\nbe cut off, Cortés galloped back to the causeway, threw himself on\r\nthe enemy, recovered the bridges, and was soon in hot pursuit of the\r\nflying Mexicans. He had not proceeded far, however, when the Indians,\r\nwho had rushed for safety into the lake and the canals, were encouraged\r\nto return to the attack and cut off the cavalry. With furious charges\r\nthey drove the guard from the bridges, and began to destroy them and\r\nremove the filling.[814] The causeway swarmed again with foes, and\r\nthe water round it was alive with canoes, whence myriads of missiles\r\nwere directed against the horsemen as they pushed their way back.\r\nOn reaching the last causeway breach, nearest the city, the riders\r\nfeared they would be overwhelmed, for here the enemy was gathered\r\nin masses and had destroyed the passage. Nothing was left for them\r\nbut to take to the water, midst a storm of stones and darts, while\r\nlines of spears and javelins pressed against them from the land and\r\nfrom canoes. The party was thrown in disorder, and one rider was\r\npitched from his saddle during the mêlée, obstructing the passage\r\nto the rest.[815] Cortés remained the last to cover the retreat, and\r\nsingle-handed now and then turned on the swarming warriors, striking\r\nwith the energy of despair. Eager to secure the great general, the\r\nenemy pressed heavily upon him, and but for the stout armor protecting\r\nhimself and the horse he would certainly have perished. As it was, he\r\nreceived two severe wounds in the knee, besides many scratches. The\r\nlast Spaniard having left the bank, Cortés rang loud his San Pedro\r\ncry, and clearing the way he leaped his heavily laden horse across the\r\nchasm, six feet in width, and quickly left behind him the discomfited\r\ncrowd. “Had not God helped me,” he writes, “that moment would have\r\nbeen my last.” Indeed, it was already rumored in the city that he\r\nwas dead. It being found impossible to hold the causeway bridges, a\r\nguard was left only at the others, while the remainder of the troops\r\nreturned to the fort, worn-out and demoralized.[816]\r\n\r\nLong since it had been agreed among the Spaniards that the city must\r\nbe evacuated; time and method were the only questions. The former\r\nof these was now resolved on by the council: it should be this very\r\nnight. It was safer to meet the issue now than later. The enemy was\r\nhourly reinforced. Perilous indeed was the undertaking to pass with\r\nluggage, war stores, prisoners, and women over the broken causeway\r\nin the darkness; but to remain was death. Botello, the astrologer,\r\nhad declared for this time, and so it was determined. For Botello\r\nwas wise and prudent, knowing Latin and the stars; he had foretold\r\nthe greatness of Cortés, and had recommended his night attack on\r\nNarvaez, and general and soldiers believed in him.[817] Had he lived\r\na century or two later his words might have been employed as the _vox\r\nstellarum_ by the almanac makers. The Mexicans had said that they\r\nwould make it a time of sore distress, any attempted escape of the\r\nintruders, a time when men must struggle, and women would pray and\r\nweep; and if so, it were no worse for the fugitives that black night\r\nshould fling her mantle over the bloody scene.\r\n\r\nSince the Indians were supposed to have destroyed the crossing at the\r\ncauseway channels, a portable bridge was made with which to effect\r\nthe passage. Two more would probably have been made had time and\r\nconvenience permitted, but misfortune willed it otherwise. It was\r\nagreed that a large portion of the effects must be left behind in order\r\nnot to encumber the march, but the gold demanded special care. The\r\nroyal officials, Mejía and Ávila, were charged to secure it, and for\r\nthis purpose a number of carriers were assigned, the general giving\r\nalso one of his own mares. Their convoy was intrusted to a body of\r\ninfantry, under Alonso de Escobar.[818] The secretary, Hernandez,\r\nand the royal notaries were called to testify that all had been\r\ndone that was possible. There still remained a large quantity of the\r\nbulky jewels belonging to the king, besides a mass of unappropriated\r\ntreasure, which could not be intrusted to carriers, or for which no\r\ncarriers were found, and rather than leave them to the ‘Indian dogs’\r\nCortés announced that the soldiers might take all they wished—after\r\npermitting his favorites the first selection. He warned them, however,\r\nthat the more they took the more their safety would be endangered.\r\nThe adherents of Cortés do not appear to have been eager to encumber\r\nthemselves, and Bernal Diaz shared this prudence in taking only four\r\nchalchiuite stones. The men of Narvaez practised less restraint, and\r\nmany loaded themselves with the metal. Cortés was afterward charged\r\nwith having appropriated a considerable share of the wealth thus\r\nthrown open; he certainly had funds with which to send for horses,\r\nwar material, and supplies.[819]\r\n\r\nSandoval was appointed to lead the van, with two hundred infantry and\r\ntwenty horsemen, assisted by Ordaz, Andrés de Tapia, and others. With\r\nhim went fifty men under Captain Magarino to carry the bridge. They\r\nwere pledged to remain at their post to the last, and were escorted\r\nby a select body of infantry and allies. For the middle were destined\r\nthe baggage and treasure, the prisoners and the sick, under a large\r\nescort, supervised by Cortés himself, who, with Olid, Morla, Ávila,\r\nand other captains, and a special force of one hundred men, were to\r\nrender aid where needed. The artillery was intrusted to two hundred\r\nand fifty Tlascaltecs and fifty soldiers, and the rear was placed in\r\ncharge of Alvarado and Velazquez, with thirty horsemen and about one\r\nhundred adherents of Cortés, with most of the men of Narvaez. The\r\nallied forces, of whom a number appear to have returned home during\r\nthe inaction of Montezuma’s captivity, and who had suffered greatly\r\nduring the siege, must still have numbered nearly six thousand men,\r\nincluding carriers, distributed among the three divisions.[820] Among\r\nthe prisoners Cortés enumerates the legitimate son of Montezuma,\r\nand two of his daughters, probably those bestowed on the general\r\nin marriage, King Cacama and his younger brother and successor, and\r\nseveral other high personages.[821] The sick were to be carried in\r\nhammocks and behind riders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is the evening of the 30th of June.[822] Fiery copper has been the\r\nsky that day; the sun blood-red and moon-like, turning day to night,\r\nwhen night is so soon to be employed as day. As the hour approaches,\r\na fog sets in, which thickens into mist and denser moisture until,\r\nto favor the Spaniards, providence turns it to a drizzling rain,[823]\r\nthus to veil their movements, and make substantial the silence of the\r\ncity, the lake, the distant wood; and thereupon all join fervently\r\nin the prayer of Father Olmedo and commend their lives to almighty God.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight the order is given to march.[824] Stealthily they creep\r\ndown the temple square and reach the Tlacopan road.[825] The streets\r\nare wholly deserted. All is quiet, save the dull rumble of tramping\r\nsoldiers. The blessed rain, or some supernatural interposition, seems\r\nto keep the whole city within doors. And if this kind power will\r\nbut have patience and not desert them for one brief hour—ah, it is\r\nso easy for Omnipotence to help! Along the road like a phantom the\r\narmy moves. The van picks up the guard at the canal crossings. The\r\ncauseway is almost reached. Already they begin to breathe freer; a\r\nfeeling of intense relief steals into their breasts, and—Mother of\r\nGod! what noise is that? It is the piercing outcry of a woman[826]—may\r\nthe foul fiend seize her!—breaking upon the stillness like a warning\r\nnote from the watch-tower of Avernus. On the instant the war-drum\r\nof the Tlatelulco temple sends forth its doleful sound, chilling the\r\nfugitives to the very heart’s core. Quickly its tones are drowned by\r\nthe nearer, shriller trumpet-blasts and shouts of warriors, echoed\r\nand reëchoed from every quarter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the advance column had reached the sixth bridge\r\ncrossing,[827] the first to connect with the causeway, and had\r\nobliged the Mexican picket to retire, after exchanging a few shots.\r\nThe portable bridge was here laid, and the van crossed with quickened\r\nsteps, followed by the centre with the baggage and artillery. At\r\nthis juncture the enemy fell upon the rear, rending the air with\r\ntheir yells, sending their missiles fast and furious, while from the\r\ncross-roads issued a swarm, with lance and sword, on Alvarado’s flank.\r\nOver the water resounded their cries, and canoes came crowding round\r\nthe causeway to attack the forward ranks. To add to the horrors of\r\nthe tumult, several men and horses slipped on the wet bridge and fell\r\ninto the water; others, midst heart-rending cries, were crowded over\r\nthe edge by those behind. All the rest succeeded in crossing, however,\r\nexcept about one hundred soldiers. These, it is said, bewildered\r\nby the battle cries and death shrieks, turned back to the fort, and\r\nthere held out for three days, till hunger forced them to surrender\r\nand meet the fate of sacrificial victims at the coronation feast of\r\nCuitlahuatzin.[828]\r\n\r\nThe half mile of causeway extending between the first and second\r\nbreaches was now completely filled with Spaniards and allies, whose\r\nflanks were harassed by the forces brought forward in canoes on either\r\nside. Dark and foggy as the night was, the outline of the Indian crews\r\ncould be distinguished by the white and colored _tilmatli_ in which\r\nmany of them were clad, owing to the coldness of the air. Fearlessly\r\nthey jumped to the banks, and fought the Spaniards with lance and\r\njavelin, retreating into the water the moment the charge was over.\r\nSome crept up the road sides, and seizing the legs of the fugitives\r\nendeavored to drag them into the water. So crowded were the soldiers\r\nthat they could scarcely defend themselves; aggressive movements were\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\nRepeated orders had been transmitted to Magarino to hurry forward\r\nthe removal of his bridge to the second channel, and, seeing no more\r\nsoldiers on the opposite bank of the first opening, he prepared to\r\nobey, but the structure had been so deeply imbedded in the banks from\r\nthe heavy traffic that his men labored for some time in vain to lift\r\nit, exposed all the while to a fierce onslaught. Finally, after a\r\nnumber of the devoted band had succumbed, the bridge was released,\r\nbut before it could be drawn over the causeway the enemy had borne it\r\ndown at the other end so as effectually to wreck it.[829] The loss of\r\nthe bridge was a great calamity, and was so regarded by the troops,\r\nhemmed in as they were between two deep channels, on a causeway which\r\nin width would hold only twenty men in a line. On all sides were\r\nenemies thirsting for blood. Presently a rush was made for the second\r\nchannel, where the soldiers had already begun, in face of the foe, to\r\ncross on a single beam, which had been left intact when the bridge\r\nwas destroyed. As this was an exceedingly slow process, many took\r\nto the water, only to receive their death-blow at the hands of the\r\nwatermen. Some were taken prisoners; some sank beneath their burden\r\nof gold; the horses found a ford on one side where the water was not\r\nabove the saddle.\r\n\r\nThe canoes, however, were as numerous here as elsewhere, and their\r\noccupants as determined; and the horsemen had the greatest trouble\r\nto keep their seats while resisting them. The general, being at\r\nthe head, suffered most. At one time some Indians seized him by the\r\nlegs and tried to drag him off. The footing of the horse being so\r\ninsecure, the attempt would probably have succeeded but for the prompt\r\naid of Antonio de Quiñones, and Texmaxahuitzin, a Tlascaltec, known\r\nafterward as Antonio. Olid, who also came to the rescue, was almost\r\noverpowered, but managed to free himself by means of backhanded blows\r\nfrom his muscular arm. One of the cavalry, Juan de Salazar, the page\r\nof Cortés, then took the lead to clear the way for the rest, only to\r\nfall a victim to his zeal. The next moment his master had gained the\r\nbank, and thereupon directed the troops by the ford.[830]\r\n\r\nThus in the darkness the wild roar of battle continued, the commingling\r\nshouts and strokes of combatants falling on the distant ear as one\r\ncontinuous moan. The canoes now pressed on the fugitives in greater\r\nnumber at the ford than in the channel. Sandoval, with his party,\r\nhad swum the channel before the Mexicans assembled there in great\r\nnumbers, and was now leading the van down the causeway, scattering the\r\nassailants right and left. Little regular fighting was attempted, the\r\nSpaniards being intent on escaping and the Mexicans quickly yielding\r\nbefore the cavalry, taking refuge in and round the canoes. With\r\ngreater hardihood and success, however, they harassed those on foot.\r\nOn reaching the next channel, which was the last, the fugitives found\r\nwith dismay that it was wider and deeper than the others, and with\r\nbitter regret they saw their mistake in not bringing three portable\r\nbridges. The enemy was here also gathering in ever increasing force, to\r\nwatch the death trap. Every effort to clear a passage was stubbornly\r\nresisted, and, the soldiers growing more irresolute, a rider was sent\r\nto bring Cortés. Before he arrived, however, Sandoval had already\r\nplunged in with a number of the cavalry, followed by foot-soldiers,\r\nwho seized the opportunity to fall into the wake, by either holding\r\non to the trappings of the horses or striking out for themselves. The\r\npassage was extremely difficult, and more than one horseman reeled\r\nand fell, from the united pressure of friends and foes. Those who\r\nfollowed suffered yet more, being pushed down by comrades, struck by\r\nclubs and stones, pierced by spears, or, most horrible of all, drawn\r\nin by dusky boatmen, who carefully guarded them for the dread stone\r\nof sacrifice.\r\n\r\nWith five horsemen Cortés led a body of one hundred infantry to\r\nthe mainland. Accompanying this force was a number of carriers with\r\ntreasures secured by the general and his friends. Leaving the gold\r\nin charge of Jaramillo, with orders to hold the entrance of the\r\ncauseway against assailants from the shore, Cortés returned to the\r\nchannel where Sandoval had taken a stand to keep clear the bank and\r\nprotect the passage. Tidings coming that Alvarado was in danger,\r\nCortés proceeded to the rear, beyond the second channel, and found\r\nit hotly contested. His opportune arrival infused fresh courage,\r\nas with gallant charges he relieved the troops from the terrible\r\npressure. He looked in vain for many comrades who had been placed\r\nat this post, and would have gone in search of them had not Alvarado\r\nassured him that all the living were there. He was told that the guns\r\nreserved for the rear had for a while been directed with sweeping\r\neffect against the ever growing masses of warriors around them; but\r\nfinally a simultaneous attack from the canoe crews on either side, and\r\nfrom the land forces to the rear, impelled by their own volume, had\r\noverwhelmed the narrow columns nearest the city, together with their\r\ncannon, killing and capturing a large number, and throwing the rest\r\ninto the panic-stricken condition from which he had just extricated\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLeaving Alvarado to cover the rear as best he could, Cortés hastened\r\nto direct the passage of the middle channel. What a sight was there!\r\nOf all the bloody terrors of that dark, sorrowful night, this was the\r\nmost terrible! A bridge had been wanting, and behold, the bridge was\r\nthere! With dead and living fugitives the chasm on either side the\r\nslippery beam had been filled,[831] and now the soldiers and allies\r\nwere rushing, heedless of the groans beneath them, across this gory\r\nsupport, still narrow and full of gaps, to be filled by the next\r\ntripping fugitive. Scattered pell-mell on the bank lay the baggage\r\nand artillery, abandoned by the fleeing carriers, which, proving only\r\nan obstruction, Cortés ordered it thrown into the channel in order\r\nto widen the crossing.\r\n\r\nBut the end was not yet. Great as had been the woe, it was yet to be\r\nincreased at the last and wider channel. Here was indeed a yawning\r\nabyss, having likewise a single remaining beam, whose narrow slippery\r\nsurface served rather as a snare than a support.[832] The necessarily\r\nslow motion of the train had enabled the Mexicans to come up in swarms,\r\nand like sharks surround the chasm. Harassed on every side, and with\r\nan avalanche rolling against the rear, the retreating thought only\r\nof escaping the new danger, and at once. They threw aside their arms\r\nand treasures and plunged in, bearing one another down regardless\r\nof any claims of friendship or humanity. And woful to hear were the\r\nheart-rending cries from that pit of Acheron. Some begged help of\r\nMary and Santiago; some cursed their fate and him who had brought\r\nthem to it, while many sank with mute despair into the arms of death;\r\nand over all roared the wild cries and insults of the Mexicans. In\r\nstrong contrast to the panic-stricken men appeared a woman, María de\r\nEstrada, who, with shield and sword, faced the enemy like a lioness,\r\nstanding forth among the men as a leader, and astonishing friend and\r\nfoe with her prowess.[833]\r\n\r\nCortés did all he could, as became an able commander and valiant\r\nsoldier, to save his men. He was indefatigable in his efforts, being\r\neverywhere present, encouraging, guiding, and protecting. Yet his\r\nposition was most trying; there were that night so many brave soldiers\r\ngiven over to despair, so many ears deaf to commands and prudent\r\ncounsel. Unable to do more at the channels, he hastened to look to\r\nthose who had crossed and were proceeding in straggling bands to join\r\nJaramillo. Heedless of companies or officers, the soldiers had banded\r\nin parties of a score or two, and sword in hand, where this had not\r\nbeen thrown away, they were hurrying down the causeway.[834] The\r\nassailants fell off somewhat beyond the last channel, and finding the\r\nadvance comparatively safe, guided by his soldierly impulses Cortés\r\nagain returned with a few horsemen[835] and foot-soldiers to cover\r\nthe remnant of the army. The rear, composed chiefly of the Narvaez\r\nparty, were approaching the last channel, but under the continued\r\nonslaught panic had seized them. They made hardly an effort to defend\r\nthemselves, and like the Indians during the massacre by Alvarado they\r\nhuddled one against the other, offering their backs as a target for\r\nunsparing attack. Among this number was the loyal and noble Velazquez\r\nde Leon, who shared with the Tonatiuh the command of this section.\r\nHow he fell is not known, but he never crossed the last breach.[836]\r\n\r\nAlvarado had been wounded and had lost his horse, in common with most\r\nof his party. Finding it impossible to control the men, he gathered\r\na small band round him and sought the channel, leaving the rest to\r\nlook to themselves.[837] On reaching the spot he saw a confused\r\nmass of struggling humanity in the water, but the solitary beam\r\nwhich spanned it was vacant, and steadying himself with his lance he\r\nsprang swiftly across. Narrow and slippery as was the beam, it was\r\nno insignificant feat for a wounded man to cross upon it, but time\r\nmagnified the performance to something miraculous. When Alvarado came\r\nto the channel, it is related, no friendly beam spanned the wide,\r\ndeep gap. His life turned on brief resolve and instant action. Lithe,\r\nstrong, and determined, even though wounded, he was not yet ready to\r\nyield all. With a searching glance into the troubled pool and across\r\nthe awful chasm he stepped back for a preparatory spring. Then,\r\nrushing forward, he planted the long pike upon the yielding débris\r\nand vaulted across, to the wonder of all witnesses. The Indians, says\r\nCamargo, prostrated themselves in admiration, and tearing up grass,\r\nate it, with the exclamation, “Truly, this man is the Tonatiuh!” So\r\nruns the story, preserved by tradition, and by the name yet given to\r\nthe spot, ‘El Salto de Alvarado.’[838]\r\n\r\nCortés and his small band of rescuers came up as Alvarado appeared,\r\npike in hand and bleeding, accompanied by a few stragglers.[839] Among\r\nthese was Juan Tirado, who, in gratitude for his deliverance, erected\r\nat this bridge after the conquest a hermitage to San Acacio, known also\r\nas De los Mártires—martyrs to avarice, as Torquemada intimates.[840]\r\nThe badly wounded were now mounted behind the horsemen,[841] and\r\nrepelling the foes who still pressed on them, Cortés in person covered\r\nthe remnant of the army in its retreat toward Tlacopan,[842] losing\r\nin this final struggle the gallant Captain Morla.[843] The route lay\r\nthrough Popotla village or suburb; and here, according to tradition,\r\nCortés seated himself on a stone to weep over the misfortunes of this\r\nSorrowful Night.[844]\r\n\r\nBy a similar process of annealing, gold is made soft and iron hard;\r\nso by misfortune the wise man is made wiser while the fool is hardened\r\nin his folly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [808] According to the version of the rabid Duran, based\r\n     on native paintings and narratives, the bodies of the\r\n     prisoners were found in the fort after its evacuation,\r\n     that of Montezuma with five stabs in the breast. _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, MS., ii. 477-9. Acosta seems rather to favor the\r\n     story, improbable as several of its points are. _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, 524. To some extent it rests on the statement\r\n     repeated by Ixtlilxochitl, which assumes that Cacama, who\r\n     had made himself particularly obnoxious to the Spaniards,\r\n     was killed with 47 stabs before the fort was evacuated.\r\n     _Hist. Chich._, 301. A more severe account is found in a\r\n     manuscript fragment in Ramirez’ collection, written by a\r\n     Tezcucan, wherein it is related that a sword was thrust into\r\n     the intestines, ‘por la parte baxa.’ The body was thereupon\r\n     taken to the roof, as if to address the people. A stone\r\n     struck the head, and now the Spaniards proclaimed that this\r\n     had caused the death. _Soc. Mex. Geog._, _Boletin_, x. 362.\r\n     This is substantially repeated in _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Rel._,\r\n     457. A stronger testimony, however, comes from Sahagun,\r\n     who states that Cortés recommended to his followers the\r\n     murder of the prisoners in order to terrify the natives\r\n     and to assume the mastery. ‘Y lo primero que hicieron,\r\n     fue dàr Garrote à Motecuhçuma, y à Itzquauhtzin, Señor de\r\n     Tlatelolco, y à otros.’ Version in _Torquemada_, i. 498,\r\n     and in _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._ [ed. 1840], 113. The issue,\r\n     modified by the censor, merely states that the bodies were\r\n     found near a stone, Teoaioc, outside the fort. _Id._ [ed.\r\n     1829], 31. This account has received its chief support\r\n     in the _quasi_ admission of Torquemada; and when he, the\r\n     otherwise zealous champion of the conquerors, takes such\r\n     a view, others may be pardoned for accepting it. ‘Y que\r\n     esto aia sido asi, puede ser posible, pues para tenerse\r\n     por seguros, le avian prendido; y viendo agora, que no\r\n     bastaba la prision, vsarian de este vltimo medio, para\r\n     vèr si le aplacaban, y atemoriçaban estos Mexicanos.’ i.\r\n     498-9. Brasseur de Bourbourg accepts the version, and adds\r\n     that Montezuma was told of his fate and urged to accept\r\n     baptism. ‘On répandit aussitôt la nouvelle de sa mort comme\r\n     s’il eût expiré naturellement.’ Hence even the soldiers\r\n     did not know of the murder. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 330-1.\r\n     Bustamante, of course, adopts anything Sahagun may say\r\n     against the Spaniards; and Carbajal takes Torquemada’s view,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, ii. 375, as does Beltrami, eager for any\r\n     sensation. _Mex._, ii. 145. Vetancurt seeks to reconcile\r\n     conflicting opinions by assuming that when Montezuma died\r\n     Itzquauhtzin and several other prisoners were murdered\r\n     and cast out together with the emperor’s body, in order to\r\n     terrify the Mexicans and occupy their attention while the\r\n     Spaniards hurried away. _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 142. ‘Io\r\n     non posso persuadermi,’ says Clavigero, ‘che gli Spagnuoli\r\n     si risolvessero a toglier la vita ad un Re, a cui doveano\r\n     tanti beni, e dalla cui morte non potevano aspettarsi, se\r\n     non molti mali.’ _Storia Mess._, iii. 131. Solis cannot\r\n     believe Cortés guilty of an act so bad and reckless. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, ii. 150-1. Prescott disposes of the charge as an\r\n     ‘absurdity’ and a ‘monstrous imputation.’ _Hist. Mex._, ii.\r\n     321. It must be considered, however, that the Spaniards did\r\n     seek to profit by the death; and scruples about ‘killing a\r\n     dog of an Indian,’ as they had so lately termed him, could\r\n     not have weighed with such men when their interests were\r\n     concerned; how much less when their lives were at stake?\r\n     The whole argument, then, may be said to depend on the\r\n     question whether Montezuma was more valuable as captive or\r\n     as corpse. If the people manifested little respect for the\r\n     living ruler, the Spaniards could have had no reason to\r\n     expect more for the dead. His death would only have loosened\r\n     the bond which still restrained a vast number, whether of\r\n     kindred or of mere subjects, and given the hostile leaders\r\n     fresh motives and strength for their operations. Besides,\r\n     Montezuma must have retained a great influence outside the\r\n     city, which a fugitive army would have found of service.\r\n     The recognition of this influence is shown by the efforts\r\n     made to save the imperial children, as noticed even by the\r\n     most rabid accusers of the Spaniards. It may be mentioned\r\n     that no charge is brought forward in the residencias either\r\n     against Cortés or Alvarado.\r\n\r\n     [809] Apanecatl, according to Brasseur de Bourbourg, _Hist.\r\n     Nat. Civ._, iv. 332. Bernal Diaz sends these men to carry\r\n     the news of the death, and following them were six high\r\n     personages and most of the captive priests, carrying the\r\n     body. _Hist. Verdad._, 105.\r\n\r\n     [810] Stones were thrown upon the cortege, and it was driven\r\n     from quarter to quarter. Finally Apanecatl took refuge in\r\n     the palace where Cuitlahuatzin held forth, and appealed\r\n     to him, only to be repulsed by his courtiers. The body\r\n     was nevertheless secured by a friendly party. _Manuscrit\r\n     Nahuatl_, 1576, in _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 333.\r\n\r\n     [811] ‘Hicieron todas las solemnidades que solian hacer ...\r\n     Mocthecuzoma lo enterraron en México ... algunos decian\r\n     mal de Mocthecuzoma porque habia sido muy cruel.’ _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, 31. ‘Vimos q̄ hizierõ muy gran llanto, q̄ biẽ oimos\r\n     las gritas, y aullidos q̄ por èl dauan.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 105. ‘Hizieron muy gran llanto, para\r\n     enterrar al rey en Chapultepec.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     154. Herrera combines these two authorities in saying ‘le\r\n     deuieron de enterrar en el monte de Chapultepèque, porque\r\n     alli se oyò vn gran llanto.’ dec. ii. lib. x. cap. x. He\r\n     forgets that Chapultepec lay three miles off. Torquemada\r\n     corrects Herrera, and insists that the ‘Copalco’ was the\r\n     place. He gives specimens of the insults offered during\r\n     the cremation, i. 499. ‘Estaban indignados contra él.’\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 301. It has been asserted\r\n     by some, says Duran, that the ashes were scattered to the\r\n     winds, as unworthy of preservation. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii.\r\n     479. Acosta attempts a modification by stating that the\r\n     body being contemptuously rejected, a servant burned it,\r\n     ‘y puso sus cenizas dõde pudo en lugar harto desechado.’\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, 524. The burial-place has certainly not been\r\n     pointed out to posterity. According to Sahagun, the body of\r\n     Itzquauhtzin was ‘cast forth’ from the quarters, together\r\n     with that of Montezuma, and was taken in charge by his\r\n     subjects of Tlatelulco, by whom he was greatly beloved and\r\n     mourned. ubi sup. To ‘cast forth’ the bodies could have\r\n     been only a needless insult, which Cortés was too prudent\r\n     to inflict on the people.\r\n\r\n     [812] ‘Que alçassen a su primo del Monteçuma, que con\r\n     nosotros estaua, por Rey.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     105. ‘Dixo Cortes ... el se queria hallar a sus honras.’\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. x.\r\n\r\n     [813] Prescott, following Clavigero, assumes that the whole\r\n     was an artifice to liberate the two captive priests, one\r\n     of whom was indispensable in the event of a coronation.\r\n     _Mex._, ii. 338. Brasseur de Bourbourg supposes that the\r\n     parley was conducted by the party favorable to the Spaniards,\r\n     and duped by the stronger faction, which never intended to\r\n     adhere to the arrangement. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, 321.\r\n\r\n     [814] ‘Como los peones estaban cansados y heridos y\r\n     atemorizados; ... ninguno me siguió. A cuya causa, después\r\n     de pasadas yo las puentes ... las hallé tomadas.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 134. Where had he left his prudence?\r\n\r\n     [815] ‘Hallé á todos los de caballo que conmigo iban, caidos\r\n     en ella, y un caballo suelto.’ _Id._\r\n\r\n     [816] With a loss of over twenty men. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 105. This author places all the fighting on the\r\n     causeway on one day, a Thursday, the day of evacuating\r\n     Mexico, and the day following the surrender of Montezuma’s\r\n     body. Herrera, who is far more confused, has a sally on\r\n     this day in three directions, one being the Tlacopan road;\r\n     but the operations on the latter route are only partially\r\n     told, and the rest referred to the third day of the siege.\r\n     There are also several contradictions to aid in confusing\r\n     the many who follow him. _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap.\r\n     xi. Prescott abandons himself to the guidance of Clavigero\r\n     for the occurrences of these days, but embellishes the\r\n     narrative with some incidents belonging to the siege of\r\n     Alvarado.\r\n\r\n     [817] ‘Botello ... afirmò que ... supiessen que moriria el\r\n     o su hermano, y algunos de la cõpañia, y qui se saluaria\r\n     el Capitan, y otros muchos, y ninguno si salian de dia.’\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xi. ‘Hora lo creyesen,\r\n     hora no.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 159. ‘Anteponendo le\r\n     vane osservazioni di quel meschino Soldato alla luce della\r\n     prudenza militare,’ is the indignant comment of Clavigero,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 135. But there is no doubt that\r\n     ‘military prudence’ had more weight in the matter than\r\n     Botello’s words, and that the result was not due to his\r\n     advice. Solis casts the blame of crediting the ‘ignorant\r\n     charlatan’ Botello chiefly on the majority of the council,\r\n     to whom Cortés yielded. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 171-2. In order\r\n     to lull any suspicions among the Mexicans, says Bernal\r\n     Diaz, a leading priest and some other captives were sent\r\n     to the Mexican camp with a proposal to surrender all the\r\n     gold if the Spaniards were allowed to leave in peace eight\r\n     days later. _Hist. Verdad._, 105.\r\n\r\n     [818] _Lejalde_, _Segunda Prob._, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._, ii. 424. For carrying the royal treasures ‘les dió\r\n     siete cauallos heridos, y cojos, y vna yegua, y muchos Indios\r\n     Tlascaltecas, que segun dixeron, fueron mas de ochenta.’\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 106.\r\n\r\n     [819] Bernal Diaz, for instance, states that he had hardly\r\n     taken the four chalchiuites for his share, from a collection\r\n     in a mat, when Cortés gave orders to his mayordomo to secure\r\n     it. loc. cit. His penchant for appropriating large shares\r\n     to himself is well known. Greed of gold was not now his\r\n     motive, however, but rather a prudential care to secure\r\n     means for his plans, and he could hardly neglect them when\r\n     taking so great care of the royal portion. Martyr, Gomara,\r\n     and Herrera estimate the treasure at 700,000 ducats,\r\n     chiefly in bulky jewels according to Gomara. Bernal Diaz\r\n     reckons in pesos, which may mean pesos de oro. Peter Martyr\r\n     assumes it to have been the general fund, from which the\r\n     royal fifth had been set apart only at the last moment,\r\n     but not apportioned. dec. v. cap. vi. Solis assumes that\r\n     700,000 pesos remained after the king’s portion had been\r\n     deducted. _Hist. Mex._, 174-5. One witness estimates that\r\n     over 2,000,000 pesos were lost during that night. _Cortés_,\r\n     _Residencia_, ii. 414. The _Carta del Ejército_ reduces the\r\n     loss to 400,000 pesos de oro. Another witness states that\r\n     300,000 castellanos remained when the soldiers were told\r\n     to help themselves; afterward the general compelled them\r\n     to surrender what had been thus given, only to keep it for\r\n     himself. _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. 241-2. ‘Lo demás ... lo\r\n     dimos y repartimos por los españoles para que lo sacasen,’\r\n     says Cortés, _Cartas_, 135, which may be interpreted as\r\n     either giving or intrusting. Whatever may have been left\r\n     after the Spaniards had taken their loads was gleaned by\r\n     the allies. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 159.\r\n\r\n     [820] Bernal Diaz gives Sandoval 100 young unmarried\r\n     soldiers, with Francisco de Acevedo, the dandy, Ordaz, Tapia,\r\n     and eight or nine of Narvaez’ men, captains on his staff.\r\n     To Cortés he gives 50 men, and adds B. V. de Tapia to his\r\n     staff. _Hist. Verdad._, 105. This author is contradictory,\r\n     however. Herrera places Antonio de Quiñones as Sandoval’s\r\n     chief aid, and Olid and Ordaz in the rear. dec. ii. lib. x.\r\n     cap. xi.; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 160; _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     134; _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 30 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [821] Herrera adds a brother of Montezuma, and Sahagun names\r\n     two sons. _Hist. Conq._, 33. So does Vetancurt, although he\r\n     assumes that one was saved. _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 142-3.\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl gives a longer list, including two sons of\r\n     Montezuma, and two sons and four daughters of Nezahualpilli,\r\n     of Tezcuco. One of the daughters escaped, but it was not\r\n     the beloved of Cortés, who had been baptized and named\r\n     Juana. Cacama is not included in the list, because he is\r\n     assumed to have been stabbed to death before the fort was\r\n     evacuated. _Hist. Chich._, 302; _Relaciones_, 390. With\r\n     the prisoners’ division went Marina, the interpreter, the\r\n     Tlascaltec princesses Luisa and Elvira, and some other\r\n     women, protected, says Bernal Diaz, by 30 soldiers and 300\r\n     Tlascaltecs.\r\n\r\n     [822] This date is based on Cortés’ letter, wherein he places\r\n     the arrival on Tlascala’s border on Sunday, July 8th, after\r\n     giving a clear account of the intermediate days. Any doubt\r\n     about this date is removed by the testimony in _Lejalde_,\r\n     _Segunda Probanza_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 423,\r\n     wherein the leading captains state that the siege lasted\r\n     six days. This testimony also clears up the only doubtful\r\n     point in Cortés’ account of the siege operations, where\r\n     he disposes of the wounding and death of Montezuma in one\r\n     sentence, and then resumes the description of the fighting\r\n     in a manner that has assisted to mislead Gomara and many\r\n     others into extending the stay in Mexico till July 10th.\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl adopts this date, yet in the _Relaciones_, 390,\r\n     412-13, he states that the siege lasted only seven days.\r\n     Bernal Diaz places the eve of the departure on a Thursday,\r\n     July 10th [with Cortés it is Saturday], yet he dates the\r\n     battle of Otumba just one week later than Cortés. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 105, 108. This latter date induces Zamacois to\r\n     change the date of flight to July 8th. _Hist. Méj._, iii.\r\n     406-7. ‘La notte del 1 Luglio,’ says Clavigero, _Storia\r\n     Mess._, iii. 135, but his reasons for the date are wrong,\r\n     and the term he uses may apply also to the night following\r\n     that adopted in the text.\r\n\r\n     [823] The Spaniards recognized this as a favoring shield\r\n     direct from God, says Duran, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 473-4.\r\n\r\n     [824] Ojeda was instructed to see that no somnolent or sick\r\n     person was left. He found one man asleep on the roof and\r\n     roused him. _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xi. Gomara\r\n     takes the trouble to deny the statement of Cano that 270\r\n     men, ignorant of Cortés’ departure, were left behind to\r\n     perish. _Oviedo_, iii. 551. A later note will explain the\r\n     cause of this rumor.\r\n\r\n     [825] The ravaging sallies of the preceding days, which\r\n     had involved the destruction of houses in the vicinity and\r\n     along the approaches to Tlacopan, had evidently obliged\r\n     the enemy to retire from these streets and seek shelter\r\n     elsewhere for the night. Oviedo assumes that Cortés led\r\n     the way, but Diaz and Herrera let him advance only when\r\n     the first troops are guided into Tlacopan.\r\n\r\n     [826] ‘Pasaron cuatro acequias, y antes que pasasen las\r\n     demas salió vna muger á tomar agua y viólos.’ _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist. Conq._, 32. ‘A devil, without doubt,’ adds Camargo,\r\n     who describes her as a keeper of an eating-house, and\r\n     indicates exactly the location of her house. _Hist. Tlax._,\r\n     167. Cortés states that the alarm was given by the guard at\r\n     the first breach held by the Mexicans, where the portable\r\n     bridge was laid down. _Cartas_, 136.\r\n\r\n     [827] Sahagun names this Mictlantonco, and the next two\r\n     Tlantecayocan and Petlacalco. In another place he names\r\n     the first Tecpantzinco, and the second or third Tolteacali.\r\n     _Hist. Conq._, loc. cit., and [ed. 1840] 121-2. Torquemada\r\n     gives the second breach of the causeway the latter\r\n     name. The names should probably be written Tecpantzinco,\r\n     Tolteca-Acalulco, and Petlacalco.\r\n\r\n     [828] This native rumor, as recorded in the manuscripts\r\n     used by Duran, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 476-7, is probably\r\n     the foundation for Cano’s statement, that Cortés abandoned\r\n     270 men in the fort. Herrera reduces them to 100. ‘Que se\r\n     boluieron a la torre del templo, adonde se hizieron fuertes\r\n     tres dias.’ dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xii.\r\n\r\n     [829] Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 106, assumes that the\r\n     enemy bore it down before the baggage train had crossed, and\r\n     that the channel was filled in consequence with artillery,\r\n     baggage, and dead bodies. Gomara gets the bridge across\r\n     the second breach. Both must be mistaken, however.\r\n\r\n     [830] Camargo relates the incidents of the passage in detail,\r\n     and says that Cortés fell into a hole as the enemy pounced\r\n     upon him. The two deliverers disputed the honor of having\r\n     rescued the general. _Hist. Tlax._, 169.\r\n\r\n     [831] ‘El foso se hinchó hasta arriba; ... y los de la\r\n     retroguardia pasaron sobre los muertos. Los españoles\r\n     que aquí quedaron muertos fueron trescientos, y de los\r\n     tlaxcaltecas y otros indios amigos fueron mas de dos mil.’\r\n     _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 122.\r\n\r\n     [832] _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 4, 53, 68.\r\n\r\n     [833] ‘Casò esta Señora, con Pedro Sanchez Farfan [who\r\n     seized Narvaez], y dieronle en Encomienda el Pueblo de\r\n     Tetela.’ She married a second time, and died in Puebla.\r\n     _Torquemada_, i. 504.\r\n\r\n     [834] Bernal Diaz formed one of a band of 50, who were\r\n     repeatedly attacked with arms and midst insults. He quotes\r\n     some of the low expressions used. _Hist. Verdad._, 106.\r\n\r\n     [835] One authority states that Cortés was nearing Tlacopan,\r\n     when Olid and others called out to him that the fugitives\r\n     were accusing the captains of abandoning them, and urged that\r\n     they should turn back. ‘It is a miracle to have escaped,’\r\n     was his reply, ‘and fewer will be left if we return.’ Saying\r\n     this he headed a dozen horsemen and a few foot-soldiers\r\n     and galloped back. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 106.\r\n     But Cortés was not the man to wait in such a case till\r\n     entreaty came. ‘Yo con tres ó cuatro de caballo,’ he says,\r\n     ‘y hasta veinte peones, que osaron quedar conmigo, me fuí\r\n     en la rezaga.’ _Cartas_, 135. He takes the palm from all\r\n     American conquerors, exclaims Oviedo, iii. 326.\r\n\r\n     [836] Zamacois makes atonement for a lack of research by\r\n     inventing doughty deeds for this hero. _Hist. Méj._, iii.\r\n     417-18.\r\n\r\n     [837] Among the soldiers contributed in later times by\r\n     Garay’s expedition was one Ocampo, who, fond of scandal\r\n     and pasquinades, libelled many of the captains, among them\r\n     Alvarado, declaring that he had left Velazquez with over\r\n     200 men to die. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 106-7. The\r\n     charge came forward in the residencia, but Alvarado brought\r\n     witnesses to prove that he had lost all control over the\r\n     men, and could do nothing else than to save himself, wounded\r\n     and unhorsed as he was. There were other witnesses who did\r\n     all they could to blacken his fame, and to attribute to his\r\n     neglect of duty a great portion of the loss sustained during\r\n     that sad night. _Ramirez_, _Proceso_, 4, 38, 53, 68, and\r\n     288. Ramirez decides against the accused. But Alvarado was\r\n     admittedly brave, recklessly so, and it must be regarded\r\n     rather as his misfortune that a panic seized the men.\r\n     Perhaps, as commander intrusted with this section, he should\r\n     have remained longer at his post. This signified death,\r\n     and such men as then comprised his command he regarded as\r\n     hardly worth dying for. He chose to save life at the expense\r\n     of a blemish on his honor. More it never amounted to, for\r\n     the court absolved him. He redeemed the fault afterward by\r\n     brave achievements.\r\n\r\n     [838] Camargo intimates that several Tlascalan chiefs of the\r\n     expedition testified to the feat. _Hist. Tlax._, 168; and\r\n     Gomara adds that several followers tried to imitate it, but\r\n     failed, and were drowned. _Hist. Mex._, 160. Contradictory\r\n     as Bernal Diaz is about the incidents of the night, he\r\n     strenuously insists that the channel was examined during the\r\n     following siege and found to be too wide and too deep to\r\n     allow of such a leap. _Hist. Verdad._, 107. This solitary\r\n     denial of a story which has been adopted by almost every\r\n     writer, from Oviedo to Prescott, finds support in testimony\r\n     during the hero’s residencia, wherein it is distinctly\r\n     stated that he crossed the channel on a fixed beam. His\r\n     own testimony gives assent to the charge so formulated,\r\n     although hitherto he had no doubt allowed the other version\r\n     to be believed. _Ramirez_, _Proceso_, 4, 53, 68 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [839] Seven Spaniards and eight Tlascaltecs, all badly\r\n     wounded. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 106.\r\n\r\n     [840] ‘Durò poco este nombre, pues tampoco les convenia à\r\n     los muertos, que iban cargados de Oro.’ _Monarq. Ind._, i.\r\n     504. Zamacois describes the site as he found it not long\r\n     ago. _Hist. Méj._, iii. 421-3. Bernal Diaz implies that\r\n     the ‘martyr’ name was given in honor of those captured and\r\n     sacrificed during the siege, a year later. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     153.\r\n\r\n     [841] Alvarado was taken on Gamboa’s horse, Laso on\r\n     Sandoval’s. _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 69, 119.\r\n\r\n     [842] Alvarado said that only the dead remained behind, but\r\n     Olid insisted that a number were still fighting the enemy.\r\n     Cortés accordingly went back again and rescued several more.\r\n     _Castañeda_, in _Id._, 44. Bernal Diaz also states that\r\n     Cortés returned as far as the bridges. _Hist. Verdad._, 106.\r\n\r\n     [843] The same who sprang into the sea, off Yucatan, to\r\n     replace the rudder of his vessel, unshipped during the storm.\r\n\r\n     [844] La Noche Triste, as it has ever since been called. Amid\r\n     so much that is romantic the tendency to further romance is\r\n     often uncontrollable. The truth of this statement is open to\r\n     grave doubts. ‘Llegó [Alvarado] á Cortés, que estaba ençima\r\n     de unas gradas de un qü, sentado diçiendo muchas lástimas.’\r\n     _Oviedo_, iii. 514. Zamacois describes the enormous tree,\r\n     yet standing, which shaded the stone and bears the name\r\n     of ‘_Arbol de la Noche Triste_.’ _Hist. Méj._, iii. 424.\r\n     Prescott improves the occasion by allowing the army to file\r\n     past in sad dilapidation, regardless of the fact that the\r\n     army was already gathered in Tlacopan. _Mex._, ii. 371-2.\r\n     Testimony confirms the statement of Cortés that ‘fuí en la\r\n     rezaga, peleando con los indios hasta llegar á una ciudad\r\n     que se dice Tacuba’ [Tlacopan]. _Cartas_, 135-6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nRETREAT TO TLASCALA.\r\n\r\nJULY, 1520.\r\n\r\n     FATAL MISTAKE OF THE MEXICANS—A BRIEF RESPITE ALLOWED THE\r\n     SPANIARDS—THE REMNANT OF THE ARMY AT TLACOPAN—THEY SET OUT\r\n     FOR TLASCALA—AN EVER INCREASING FORCE AT THEIR HEELS—REST AT\r\n     THE TEPZOLAC TEMPLE—CORTÉS REVIEWS HIS DISASTERS—THE MARCH\r\n     CONTINUED AMIDST GREAT TRIBULATION—ENCOUNTER OF THE GRAND\r\n     ARMY—IMPORTANT BATTLE AND REMARKABLE VICTORY—ARRIVAL AT\r\n     TLASCALA—THE FRIENDLY RECEPTION ACCORDED THEM THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would Emperor Charles have said to Hernan Cortés had they met\r\non the morning after the Sorrowful Night! It is related of Xerxes\r\nthat with a golden crown he rewarded a pilot who had saved his life,\r\nand thereupon ordered him beheaded for having sacrificed in the\r\noperation the lives of so many of his Persian subjects. Now Cortés\r\nhad not saved the emperor’s life, nor yet the emperor’s gold; he had\r\nsacrificed many lives, and had little to show for them. Had Charles\r\nbeen there, and had he valued Spaniards as did Xerxes Persians, he\r\nmight have cut off the Estremaduran’s head; but Cortés was yet worth\r\nto Charles more than all that had been thus far lost in New Spain.\r\n\r\nProsperity implies ability; adversity, weakness of mind and\r\ncharacter. In the high-souled and chivalrous, prosperity tends to\r\nyet loftier heights, while adversity sinks the unfortunate still\r\nlower; nevertheless, the fortitude and dignity which come to the\r\nreally great under misfortune are among the grandest sights in this\r\nuniverse. I have said that Cortés might have ridden to Mexico over\r\npalm branches, midst hosannas, had he but known it; but had he done\r\nso, there would have been no greatness attending the act. The door of\r\npeaceable exit from the city of Mexico had long been open to him; but\r\nto have accepted Montezuma’s invitation hence would not have raised\r\nCortés in the estimation either of himself or of his soldiers.\r\n\r\nAfter all the terrible disasters of the Noche Triste the Spaniards were\r\nnot wholly forsaken by fortune, though they called it the irrepressible\r\nSantiago on his milk-white steed who caused the Mexicans to neglect\r\ntheir opportunity of vigorously pursuing the fugitives beyond the\r\nlast channel, and in their helpless state to exterminate them. Yet\r\nwe cannot help asking why Santiago did not come to their assistance\r\nsooner, and save them untold woe. The Spaniards, however, were not\r\ncaptious in their criticisms of benefactors, and so a small stone\r\nwas erected on the Tacuba road in honor of the mounted saint.[845]\r\nIf we would have the real cause why the Mexicans did not follow up\r\nthe Spaniards, we may find it in their greed for spoils, as Sahagun\r\nobserves, which detained the warriors, especially round the channels. A\r\nthorough search was soon instituted by them; the canals were dragged,\r\nand quantities of arms, baggage, and personal effects were secured,\r\nbeside the gold and jewels which had been taken by the Spaniards.\r\nTheir own dead they decently buried, while those of the Spaniards\r\nand their allies were more summarily disposed of, and the whole road\r\ncleared of obstructions and whatever might infect the atmosphere.[846]\r\n\r\nAccording to Gomara the discovery of the bodies of Montezuma’s son\r\nand heir and other princes created such sorrow that pursuit was on\r\nthis account suspended. It seems not unreasonable that the natives\r\nshould have charged their death wounds to the Spaniards, who, rather\r\nthan see men like King Cacama free to create mischief, should have\r\npreferred to dispatch them, offering, Medea-like, a bribe to reverence\r\nand love with a view to retard the Colchian pursuers.[847] Although\r\nthis accusation could not be proven, their death was nevertheless to\r\nbe avenged. At least forty Spaniards and a number of allies had been\r\ncaptured during the night, and at the obsequies, which were of the\r\nmost imposing order, they added solemnity to the occasion by yielding\r\ntheir hearts’ blood; while those who, according to native tradition,\r\nturned back to hold the fort for three days before they swelled the\r\nthrong of victims, were reserved for the coronation soon to follow.\r\n\r\nThe respite from close pursuit had enabled the fugitive army to join,\r\nin detached groups, the nucleus already gathered under Jamarillo\r\nin one of the squares of Tlacopan,[848] the capital of the smallest\r\ntripartite state, half a league from Mexico. A sorry spectacle was\r\nthis remainder of the brilliant army which had so lately entered\r\nMexico as conquerors. A haggard, bleeding, ragged crowd, dreggy\r\nwith mire and smeared with gore, many without weapons, and without\r\na vestige of their baggage and war stores. When Cortés arrived with\r\nthe last remnant the sun was rising, and fearing the danger of an\r\nattack in the narrow streets, such as had made the sallies in Mexico\r\nso disastrous, he hastened to conduct his men into the open field.\r\nThe movement was made none too soon, for immediately after the scouts\r\ngave warning of approaching hosts, magnified to a hundred thousand or\r\nmore, speedily the war shrieks again broke on the ears of the startled\r\ntroops. The Mexicans had sent word to Tlacopan and the neighboring\r\ntowns to intercept the fugitives, and assistance coming with the dawn\r\nthey joined in the attack.[849]\r\n\r\nA Tlascaltec chief had recommended a northward course, round the lakes,\r\nas the least exposed to pursuit, and offered himself as guide.[850]\r\nThe march was accordingly directed north-westward through some\r\nmaizefields, with Cortés leading. The enemy were upon them before the\r\nrear left the city, and several soldiers fell in the onslaught. A short\r\ndistance before them rose the hill of Totoltepec, Bird Mountain,[851]\r\nsurmounted by a temple with several strong buildings,[852] and a\r\nsmall village. This appeared an eligible spot for the rest which\r\nthey so much needed. Crossing the Tepzolac Creek, at its foot, Cortés\r\nordered the advance guard, under Ordaz, to capture it, while he faced\r\nthe pursuers. Little resistance was offered at the temple, but the\r\ngeneral was hotly pressed, as the enemy perceived that their prey\r\nwas about to escape. At this juncture it was said that the Vírgen de\r\nlos Remedios appeared, and by casting dust into the eyes of the foe\r\nenabled the Spaniards to effect their escape with little loss into\r\nthe temple. “By this time,” writes Cortés, “we had not a horse that\r\ncould run, or a horseman who could lift an arm, or a foot-soldier\r\nwho could move.”[853]\r\n\r\nA few additional intrenchments were thrown up, and the necessary\r\nguards posted to watch the baffled enemy, who perceiving the strength\r\nof the place contented themselves with flinging their missiles and\r\nfilling the air with shouts. Feeling comparatively secure, the troops\r\nabandoned themselves to rest round blazing fires. The food found in\r\nthe place, although insufficient for the demands of the half-starved\r\nmen, afforded some comfort, which was increased by grateful sleep.[854]\r\n\r\nThus were refreshed the wounded and disheartened. And with grateful\r\nhearts the remnant of the brave army returned thanks to God for\r\ndeliverance. Some, however, attributed their escape to the presence\r\namong them of the image of the Vírgen de los Remedios, which Rodriguez\r\nde Villafuerte is said to have afterward placed in the great temple of\r\nMexico. It had been brought here by the owner, although some supposed\r\nit might have come over of its own accord, as it is said to have\r\nmiraculously done in later times when detained in Mexico against its\r\nwill.[855] Some years after the Noche Triste it was found on this hill\r\nunder a bush, by a converted cacique named Juan de Tobar, who kept it\r\nfor a long time, and then by divine direction built a hermitage for\r\nit on the hill, where it had been found. The many miracles reported\r\nof the shrine induced the City of Mexico in 1574 to adopt it as a\r\npatron, and by the following year the simple chapel was replaced by\r\na fine temple worthy of the sanctity of the image which has absorbed\r\nso large a share of holy pilgrimage.[856]\r\n\r\nThe review held on Remedios Hill revealed the full extent of the blow\r\nsuffered, “one which Spaniards alone could have endured,” says Peter\r\nMartyr. At the beginning of the siege the army mustered twelve hundred\r\nand fifty Spaniards and six thousand allies, with arms and ammunition\r\nin abundance, and now little more than five hundred soldiers and less\r\nthan two thousand allies remained.[857] The baggage, artillery and\r\nammunition, intrusted to the trains of carriers, had all been lost,\r\nand a great portion of the arms carried by the men, so that only twelve\r\nbattered cross-bows and seven firelocks could be counted. What better\r\ncommentary could we have on the night’s disaster! The side arms were\r\nfortunately better preserved, and there were twenty-four horses left,\r\nnow the only formidable element of the army.[858] Of the treasure\r\nnone could tell what had been saved, the holders keeping the fact\r\nsecret. It was whispered, however, that Cortés had taken good care of\r\nthe portion appropriated by him, Bernal Diaz, among others, insisting\r\nthat with the first party conducted by the general to Tlacopan went\r\na number of carriers with gold bars and jewels. Among these is said\r\nto have been some of the royal treasure, but the officers declared\r\nthat it had all been lost, including the mare with the fifth proper,\r\nand the account books and records. The loss of the papers, however\r\nunfortunate for history, must have been rather convenient to Cortés,\r\nat least, who had a fancy for adjusting facts and figures to suit\r\nhis schemes.[859]\r\n\r\nDeeply stricken was Cortés, and bitterly did he repent of the mistakes\r\nwhich had contributed to this sad result: of having left Alvarado\r\nin charge to follow his rash bent; of having treated Montezuma and\r\nhis chiefs so inconsiderately on his arrival; and, above all, the\r\nfaulty arrangements for the flight by night.[860] His had been the\r\ngreatest conquest yet undertaken in the New World, and his the greatest\r\ndisaster. The men of Narvaez had suffered most, partly, it is said,\r\nbecause they were most eager to burden themselves with gold, but\r\nrather because they were inexperienced, and assigned chiefly to the\r\nrear. It was the gaps in the ranks of his veterans that touched Cortés\r\nmost. Gone was the dear dandy Francisco de Salcedo, whom slovenly\r\ncomrades should no more trouble! The cavalry, so sadly depleted,\r\nmissed among its number the dashing Láres[861] and the brave Morla.\r\nNeither could Botello be injured by the curses freely given him for\r\nhis false reading of the stars.[862] The death which most deeply moved\r\nCortés, however, was that of the true-hearted and brave Velazquez,\r\nwhose standing and influence, as a relative of the Cuban governor\r\nand as a man of high birth, had so greatly assisted the general in\r\ncarrying out his schemes. Cortés had in return conferred on him some\r\nof the most important commissions, ever regarding him as among the\r\ntruest of his friends. With him had died his native wife, Elvira,\r\nthe daughter of the Tlascaltec lord Maxixcatzin, and nearly every\r\nprisoner.[863]\r\n\r\nWith so many losses to deplore, it proved a solace for Cortés to\r\nfind present his favorite captains, Sandoval, Alvarado, and Olid.\r\nHis interpreters were also here, and foremost the loving Marina,\r\nwhose life, together with that of Luisa, Xicotencatl’s daughter, was\r\ndue to the zealous care of the latter’s brothers. Martin Lopez, the\r\nship-builder, also survived, and the sight of him assisted to give the\r\nthoughts of the general a hopeful bent, rousing in his enterprising\r\nspirit projects for vengeance and recuperation. Remnants though\r\nthey were, his forces were still larger than those with which he had\r\novercome Narvaez, and which he had till then regarded as sufficient\r\nfor the conquest of the empire. The experience gained and a knowledge\r\nof the country were in themselves an army; and, thank fortune, he\r\nhad some gold, and better still, allies. Tlascala was now his hope.\r\nEverything, indeed, depended on the little republic, and whether it\r\nwould afford him shelter and aid. He knew that the loss of so many\r\nof its warriors under his banner had brought wide-spread affliction,\r\nwhich might turn to hatred toward him as the cause. Thereupon he\r\ntalked to the Tlascaltec chiefs who were yet alive, and endeavored\r\nto stir in them the thirst for revenge, and excite their desires for\r\nrich spoils and increased domain.[864]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesiegers and besieged sat watching each other the whole day, but\r\nthe latter made no signs of stirring. Thinking that they would not\r\nventure forth for some time, many of the former began to file off\r\nhomeward, leaving, nevertheless, a strong force round the hill. Cortés\r\nfeared that the morrow would bring them back with reinforcements\r\nand make escape difficult. Trusting again therefore to the darkness,\r\nnow joined to the more advantageous circumstance of an open field,\r\nhe set forth, leaving the fires blazing to lull the watchfulness of\r\nthe foe. Eight captains were appointed for the different sections to\r\nmaintain the arranged order of march,[865] Cortés with a portion of\r\nthe cavalry taking the rear, as the post of danger. The rest of the\r\nhorsemen led the van, while the sound infantry formed a cordon for\r\nthe centre, wherein the wounded were carried in hammocks, or hobbled\r\nalong on hastily prepared crutches, a few being taken up behind the\r\nhorsemen. The rear had hardly left the temple before the enemy were\r\nupon them with swords and lances, many of the captured and recovered\r\nweapons of the Spaniards being now used against themselves. But the\r\nattack was not severe, partly because the pursuers had been reduced\r\nto irregular bands from the mainland settlements, whose chief object\r\nwas plunder. At dawn the town of Calacoayan was sighted, and on\r\napproaching it the mounted scouts came in a ravine upon an ambuscade\r\nformed by its warriors. Believing them to be numerous the horsemen\r\ngalloped back, and joined by others returned to charge. It is related\r\nthat the leader halting for a moment to arrange for the attack, a\r\nsoldier became impatient, and hoisting an improvised flag on his lance\r\nhe called out, “Santiago! follow me who dare!” The rest responded,\r\nand the enemy was routed with slaughter.[866] The town was ransacked\r\nfor food and fired as a warning to the assailants. The march was\r\nresumed, and the plain of Tizaapan reached, but owing to the fight\r\nat the town and the constant skirmishing only three leagues were made\r\nthat day. Toward sunset they reached the hamlet of Teuculhuacan, and\r\ntook peaceable possession of the temple for the night.[867]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt noon on the 3d the march was resumed, with quickened steps and\r\nwith less interruption. Though persistent in harassing, the pursuers\r\nfled whenever the cavalry charged, and took refuge on the hill-slopes,\r\nflinging with their missiles jeers and insults. “Women!” they cried;\r\n“cowards, who fight only when mounted! You are going whence none\r\nof you shall escape!” The latter threat was frequently heard, but\r\nits meaning failed as yet to be understood. There was a worse enemy\r\nthan the Mexicans, however, and that was hunger, which made itself\r\nseverely felt, “although Spaniards can endure its pangs better than\r\nany other nation,” vaunts Gomara, “and this band of Cortés’ better\r\nthan all.” Eagerly they scanned the road side for fruit or roots,\r\nand many ate grass, while the Tlascaltecs threw themselves upon the\r\nground and begged their gods to take pity upon them.[868] One soldier\r\nopened a dead body and ate the liver, and when Cortés heard of it\r\nhe ordered the man hanged, but the sentence was not executed. The\r\nroute, at first craggy, passed through the towns of Quauhtitlan and\r\nTepotzotlan, along the lake of Zumpango, to Citlaltepec, where camp\r\nwas formed. The inhabitants had fled, but food was there to eat, and\r\neven to carry on their journey, and there they remained all the next\r\nday.[869]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 5th of July they skirted the lake and turned\r\nwestward to Tlascala, pursued by increasing forces;[870] owing\r\nto which, or to the roughness of the road, or to the guide, less\r\nprogress was made than on the previous day, and camp was pitched at\r\nthe deserted hamlet of Xoloc. The following day they proceeded toward\r\nthe Azaquemecan Mountains, and halted at the town Zacamolco.[871]\r\nObserving a mysterious movement among the Indians on the slope, Cortés\r\nset out with five horsemen and a dozen foot-soldiers to reconnoitre.\r\nAfter skirting the mountain he came in sight of a large army,[872]\r\nwith a portion of which he came to close quarters, the fleet natives\r\nhaving gained on the foot-soldiers in making the turn of the hill.\r\nIn the mêlée Cortés was badly wounded in the head.[873] He retreated\r\nto camp and had the wound bandaged, and the forces were hurried away\r\nfrom the town, which appeared too exposed for an attack. The Indians\r\npursued them so closely that two men were killed and a number wounded,\r\nbeside four or five horses. One of the animals died, and although the\r\ntroops deplored its loss, the meat proved acceptable, for roasted maize\r\nwith a little fruit had been their only food for several days.[874]\r\nCamp appears to have been formed for the night in a hamlet among the\r\nhills, the enemy being left on the opposite western slope of the range.\r\n\r\nA serious encounter being apprehended the next day, additional crutches\r\nand hammocks were prepared for those of the wounded who had hitherto\r\nbeen carried on horseback, so as to leave the cavalry free in its\r\nmovements.[875] Before dawn on July 7th[876] the march was resumed,\r\nin the hope of eluding the forces in the rear, little suspecting that\r\nthis was but a wing of the main body now preparing to surround them.\r\nThey had proceeded about a league, and were on the point of entering\r\nthe large plain of Otumba,[877] when the scouts came galloping back\r\nwith the information that the whole field was filled with warriors\r\nin battle array. The hearts of the Spaniards sank within them. They\r\nwere hoping to escape an enemy such as this.[878] Cortés ordered a\r\nhalt, and with his captains talked over the situation. Retreat was\r\nout of the question, and to turn aside would be useless. “We must\r\ncharge upon this host,” said Cortés; “we must make our path through\r\nits very centre. Remember your dead comrades; remember your God;\r\ncomport yourselves like Christian soldiers, and this idolatrous horde\r\nwill melt before you like the morning mist.” He thereupon issued the\r\nnecessary instructions for charging and resisting, and for protecting\r\nthe disabled. The horsemen were to ride with loose rein, lancing at\r\nthe faces, so as to break the enemy’s lines, and open a path for the\r\ninfantry, who were to follow and thrust their sidearms at the bowels\r\nof their assailants.[879]\r\n\r\nCommending themselves to the virgin, and invoking the aid of Santiago,\r\nthe troops advanced and entered the plain, skirted on the east by\r\nthe lower ranges of the Tlaloc, which inclosed in the distance the\r\ntown of Otumba. The sight was as grand as it was terrifying. In every\r\ndirection were seemingly endless columns, with flowing plumage,\r\nbrilliant shields of varied designs, and above and beyond these a\r\nforest of glittering iztli points. “It was the finest army Spaniards\r\never encountered in the Indies,” exclaims Bernal Diaz. Their number\r\nwas legion, and the richness of their attire signified the presence\r\nof the strength and nobility of the empire. The original estimate was\r\ndoubled, and that was increased fourfold, until, like Don Quixote’s\r\nsheep, two hundred thousand seemed small. Aware of the route taken\r\nand the destination of the Spaniards, Cuitlahuatzin had sent orders\r\nto the caciques of Otumba, Teotihuacan, Calpulalpan, and adjoining\r\nregion, to mass their forces here and exterminate the intruders. This\r\norder came most opportune, for at the time a fair was held at Otumba,\r\nwhich attracted a large concourse, from which volunteers were readily\r\nobtained for so laudable an object, represented not only as easy of\r\nachievement, but as profitable from the spoils that were to follow.\r\nA strong force from the lake region had come to form the nucleus of\r\nthe army, the command of which was assumed by Cihuacatzin, lord of\r\nTeotihuacan.[880]\r\n\r\nThe sight of the sorry remnant of the Spanish army was greeted by\r\nthe native host with triumphant shouts, trumpet blasts, and the\r\nclashing of weapons. Nothing should now prevent their escape; they\r\nwere doomed! Cautiously the Indians advanced to surround them; for\r\nthough the wounded and bedraggled band was small, it still looked\r\nviperish. Like the French in Egypt the Mexicans might have said that\r\nthe centuries were looking down on them from the mystic towers of\r\nTeotihuacan, consecrated to the sacred past. It was natural enough\r\nfor them to feel glad and proud; surely the invaders had brought\r\nthem misery enough to justify any return. But let them not forget\r\nthat there are still strong men, now nerved to desperation. And just\r\nbeyond the mountain fringe, toward which pointed their holy banner\r\nof the cross, was a promised land, ‘the land of bread,’ and, as they\r\nhoped, of trusty friends.\r\n\r\nCortés did not wait for them to advance too near before he made\r\na charge. With head and arm bandaged he led the cavalry, which in\r\nparties of five rushed at the enemy, lancing straight at the face,\r\nand opening a way for the infantry, which followed at a quick pace,\r\nthrusting sword and pike as they had been directed.[881] This tactic\r\ndisconcerted the natives somewhat, and discarding their projectile\r\nweapons the front ranks seized on lances, two-handed swords, and heavy\r\nclubs, encouraging one another by shouting the names of their towns\r\nand districts. After breaking the lines the horsemen turned to open\r\nanother path in the direction of the infantry, throwing the Indians\r\nin a disorderly pressure one against the other, and keeping them in a\r\nstate of apprehension as to where the mounted avalanche would next roll\r\nover them. Again the horsemen turned, dashing close along the flanks\r\nof the troops, scattering the intermediate assailants in confusion,\r\nand rendering them an easy prey to the foot-soldiers. Swift as the\r\nwind the gallant Sandoval flew past, crying to his comrades: “We win\r\nto-day, señores! We win to-day, God helping us!” María de Estrada was\r\nlikewise there, cheering onward the men, and sharing danger with the\r\nforemost of the brave.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed seem to persons of less confidence than the Spaniards\r\nthat some supernatural power had been necessary on this day to deliver\r\nthem. Nor did the Tlascaltecs belie their fame as warriors, for they\r\nfought like lions, as the soldier-chronicler declares, the chief\r\nCalmecahua being particularly conspicuous for his bravery.[882]\r\n\r\nFor a while the horsemen had it all their own way, chiefly, as Cortés\r\nobserves, because the enemy consisted of such disorganized masses\r\nas to prevent one another either from fighting or fleeing; but as\r\nthey became more used to the Spanish tactics they offered firmer\r\nresistance. The horse of the general being so severely struck in\r\nthe mouth as to become unmanageable, Cortés dismounted and turned it\r\nloose to seek another. The injured animal, seemingly imbued with its\r\nmaster’s spirit, dashed at the enemy in mad career, creating quite a\r\npanic in its course. The cavalry took advantage of the confusion to\r\nfollow, partly with a view to secure the animal; after regaining the\r\nmain body they indulged in a brief rest. The heat no less than the\r\nfighting had tired out both men and horses; but there was for them\r\nlittle respite, for no sooner had the foes observed their inaction\r\nthan they closed in round them with renewed courage. “Thrust well\r\nand deep,” came the order to the soldiers, “for they are all chiefs!”\r\nAnd so they seemed, from their rich dress, their elaborate devices,\r\nand their glittering ornaments. Cortés now mounted a horse whose\r\nviciousness had hitherto consigned him to the baggage department,[883]\r\nand again the cavalry formed, this time in more compact order. But the\r\nenemy, ever relieved by fresh men, maintained the firmness with which\r\nthey had begun the charge, and both horsemen and foot-soldiers found\r\nthe pressure becoming greater and the fight hotter. Thus the battle\r\ncontinued during the greater part of the forenoon,[884] the natives\r\nevidently as fresh as ever, and the Spaniards visibly failing. “We\r\nthought surely that this was to be our last day,” writes Cortés, “in\r\nview of the great strength of the Indians and the little resistance\r\nthey could find in us, tired as we were, and nearly all wounded, and\r\nfaint with hunger.”\r\n\r\nA feeling of suffocation and deathly despair comes over the Spaniards\r\nas the dusky host fold them in closer and yet fiercer embrace. Hot\r\nfalls the blood-reeking breath upon their faces, as, flushed with\r\nsuccess and sure of their victims, the foe lay hold of the Spaniards to\r\ndrag them away to the sacrifice. Rare offerings to the gods, indeed,\r\nare these magnificent men! And such they will surely become if Mary,\r\nSantiago, or the ready genius of Cortés appears not quickly to the\r\nrescue! But how shall there be rescue? What rescue is there to the\r\nsinking ship alone in mid-ocean? Can this Cortés for the release of\r\nhis comrades baffle death like Hercules for the release of Alcestis?\r\n\r\nSo it would seem. Behold yonder grand personage, borne aloft in open\r\nlitter, high over the others, with plumed head-dress, and above it\r\nthe gold-net standard, the _tlahuizmatlaxopilli_, set with precious\r\nfeathers, and secured to his back by a staff, according to custom.[885]\r\nThis is the generalissimo of all the native forces there gathered,\r\nand around him are the flower of the army in feathered armor of rich\r\ndesigns, guarding with zealous care the banner, and encouraging the\r\nrest to renewed efforts and brave deeds. Cortés sees him, and his\r\npurpose for weal or woe is fixed almost before his comrades are aware\r\nof the chieftain’s approach; for he comes as captain of the hounds\r\nto be in at the death of these Spanish foxes. Cortés is well aware\r\nof the importance attached by natives to the person of the general,\r\nand to the safe-keeping of the standard. In these centre all the\r\nhope of their armies: success is theirs so long as they remain; but\r\nonce brought low, and the Indian regards all as lost. Even at this\r\njuncture Cortés does not fail to observe the increased firmness and\r\nspirit among the warriors as the banner approaches. Here, then, is\r\nthe one chance more, which is all the brave man asks. With a quick\r\nmotion to his mounted followers, pointing to the sacred insignia, and\r\nas if he would throw the whole might of Spain into his brief words,\r\nCortés cries out: “Señores, let us break with them! In the name of\r\nGod and St Peter, señores, let us close with them!” Not a man there\r\nbut knew that the next moment would determine all, would determine\r\nthe fate of every Spaniard in New Spain.\r\n\r\nThrowing themselves with the compact force of one of their own\r\ncannon-balls against the heaving mass, they mow an instant path to\r\nthe charmed centre. The wave of disorder strikes the sacred guard,\r\nwhile the unruly horse of Cortés, bearing him unresistingly onward,\r\noverturns the litter of the generalissimo, and hurls the bearers to\r\nthe ground. “Victory!” shouts Cortés, when he recovers his breath; and\r\n“victory! victory!” echo his people, while Juan de Salamanca plunges\r\nhis lance into the body of the prostrate chief, and seizing the sacred\r\nbanner, presents it to the general as his rightful trophy.[886]\r\n\r\nThe welcome cry of Cortés electrified the whole Spanish line, while\r\nthe warriors lately so triumphant stood stupefied with dismay. With\r\nthe disappearance of the palladium their courage had fallen, while\r\nthe Spanish soldiers, with the confidence and strength of joy, rushed\r\nfrom wing to wing upon them. The warriors wavered; then, with one more\r\nsearching glance in the direction of the guiding emblem, they became\r\nconvinced that their leader had indeed fallen. Consternation followed;\r\nthe panic from the centre overtook the more distant, and valiantly\r\nas they had fought before, as cravenly did they now flee.[887]\r\n\r\nForgetful of wounds and hunger, and regardless of the imminent danger\r\nattending such a course, the Spaniards pursued the foolish fugitives,\r\nthrusting and slashing at them until they had killed twenty thousand—a\r\nround figure, truly, and one which accords well with the estimates\r\nof the entire force. But after all, what the natives had hitherto\r\nsuffered must have been little compared with the present slaughter,\r\nfor their dead lay very thick along the line of retreat. Hardly one\r\namong the Spaniards had come off scathless, while few of the poor\r\nTlascaltecs were left to share in the rich spoils.[888]\r\n\r\nAfter recalling the troops from their bloody pursuit, the first care of\r\nCortés was to see that the wounded soldiers had rest and refreshment.\r\nThen a solemn thanksgiving service was held, and right earnestly\r\ndid they all join in its offering. Cortés ascribed the victory to\r\nSt Peter, as with his name on his lips he had made the miraculous\r\ncharge. But Santiago was the soldiers’ favorite, as they declared he\r\nwas present and fought with them; and near the village of Tenexcalco\r\na chapel was afterward erected to commemorate his appearance.[889]\r\n\r\nObviously this battle was the most important so far in the New World;\r\nand it must ever be regarded as one of the most remarkable in history.\r\nThe natives were probably much less numerous than the estimates of the\r\nboastful victors; still they were immensely superior in number and\r\ncondition to the Spaniards, enfeebled by recent defeat, by wounds,\r\nand want. Further, the latter had no fire-arms wherewith to terrify\r\nthe natives, only swords and pikes. Their main advantage lay in their\r\nhorses, their discipline, and the genius of their leader;[890] all\r\nstrengthened by the enthusiasm born of a national pride, and a certain\r\nknowledge that failure meant utter destruction.\r\n\r\nFatigued as all were, and weakened from battle, Cortés resolved\r\nnevertheless to push on toward Tlascala the same day, fearing that the\r\nenemy might be shamed into a rally, or receive such reinforcements to\r\ntheir already immense numbers as to encourage them to return. In this\r\nhe was not mistaken, for Cuitlahuatzin had ordered Tezcuco, Chalco, and\r\nneighboring districts to send larger forces, and so insure an assumed\r\nvictory for the Otumban army. The reinforcements appear to have been\r\nalready in motion when news came of the defeat, accompanied by the\r\nrumor that a Tlascaltec army was on the way to aid the Spaniards. The\r\nhasty march eastward of the fugitives offered in itself sufficient\r\nencouragement for straggling marauders from the surrounding villages\r\nto follow in their wake and harass them with occasional missiles.[891]\r\n\r\nBy night the town of Temalacayocan[892] was reached, and here the\r\narmy obtained some food and camped in and around the temple. Badly\r\nwounded as he was, Cortés took charge of the watch, for sleep had no\r\npower over his mind at that moment. Before him rose invitingly the\r\nranges of the Tlascaltec border, where he hoped to find a haven. It\r\nwas only hope, however; for Cortés came not as before, heralded as the\r\ninvincible conqueror, to whose bravery and deeds the warlike republic\r\nwas delighted to offer homage; nor with the vision of the mighty\r\nMontezuma bending before him; nor with the prospect of entering to\r\nassume control of a great empire. All this was changed. He had lost\r\nhis former prestige, and could present himself only as a fugitive to\r\nseek protection for a remnant of his army. And this at the hands of\r\nthose who might yet smart under the stigma of defeat by a handful,\r\nand who might now find it prudent and convenient to accept the\r\nfriendship and wealth of the victorious Aztecs. What if the people\r\nof Tlascala should reject him? “We were not very confident in finding\r\nthe natives of the said province faithful and friends of ours,” writes\r\nCortés; “for we feared that they, on seeing us so dismembered, might\r\nseek our lives, in order to recover the liberty which they formerly\r\nenjoyed. This thought and fear kept us in as great an affliction as\r\nwhen we marched along harassed by those of Culúa.”[893] Nevertheless\r\nhe sought to cheer his men with hopes for the best, and to remind\r\nthem how necessary it was, now above all, to guard their conduct\r\nso as to give rise to no jealousies or unpleasantness, since even a\r\npetty quarrel might raise a whirlwind to overwhelm them. Should God,\r\nhowever, not permit them to rest in Tlascala, they must recall their\r\nmany glorious victories over greater forces than could henceforth be\r\nbrought against them, and be prepared with stout hearts and vigorous\r\narms to meet the issue.\r\n\r\nThe march was resumed in the morning with the usual precautions,\r\nalthough the pursuers fell off as the border was approached. Soon\r\nthe Spaniards reached a fountain on the slope of a hill, close to\r\nan ancient fortress, which marked the boundary of the republic.[894]\r\nResting there for a while, they drank of the water and were refreshed.\r\nThen they passed on to Hueyotlipan, a town of three or four thousand\r\nfamilies, about four leagues from the capital.[895] Here food was\r\nobtained in sufficient abundance, yet not without the stimulus of\r\npresents. The women, however, were most sympathetic in their offers\r\nto tend the wounded, although only too many were deep in mourning\r\nand clamoring for vengeance for brothers, sons, or husbands, who had\r\nfallen during the retreat. The captains did their best to console them\r\nwith the prospect of speedy victories, with bitter retaliation on the\r\nhated Aztecs. Whatever doubt yet remained of Tlascaltec disposition was\r\ndispelled in the afternoon by the arrival of the lords, including the\r\nruler of Huexotzinco, with a large suite, bearing provisions and other\r\npresents, and cheering the hearts of the discomfited with the most\r\ncordial greeting. They still showed admiration for the white heroes,\r\nand extended a sympathy for their sufferings which displayed itself\r\neven to tears. This feeling was particularly strong in Maxixcatzin,\r\nthe most powerful of the four chiefs, who gently upbraided Cortés and\r\nhis captains for not having listened to his warnings. Remonstrances\r\nwere now out of place, however, and he and his could only bid them\r\nwelcome, and tender their estates and services. They were to regard\r\nthemselves as in their own house. Their escape from the plots and\r\noverwhelming forces of the Mexicans had raised them and their prowess\r\nin the estimation of the Tlascaltecs, and they were prepared, as\r\nfriends and as vassals of the Spanish king, to shed their last drop\r\nof blood in the task of avenging the common injury suffered at the\r\nhands of their ancient enemies. How inexpressibly dear is the prospect\r\nof revenge! The hatred of the Tlascaltecs for the Mexicans was too\r\ndeep to be smothered by one reverse, and the desire to avenge their\r\nfallen brethren intensified it. When the news came of the hostile\r\ngathering at Otumba they had endeavored to procure reinforcements for\r\ntheir allies, but had not been able to collect a sufficient number\r\nin time.[896]\r\n\r\nCortés was deeply moved by the kind expressions and offers accorded\r\nhim, and sought in every way to strengthen this so vital friendship.\r\nHe exhibited profound grief over the death of so many Tlascaltec\r\nallies, and sympathized in particular with Maxixcatzin over the loss\r\nof his daughter Elvira, who had fallen with her husband Velazquez.\r\nHe also distributed presents, chiefly such as had been obtained from\r\nthe Otumba battle-field, and induced his men to follow the example.\r\nMaxixcatzin’s heart was completely won by the gift of the banner\r\ntaken from the Mexican generalissimo,[897] and other chiefs were\r\ngladdened with different trophies. The troops remained at Hueyotlipan\r\nfor three days,[898] in order to recruit somewhat, and then, assisted\r\nby a number of carriers, they passed on to the capital. Here the\r\nwhole population came forth, headed by the lords, to welcome them,\r\nwith music, and flowers, and acclamations.[899] Cortés was taken in\r\ncharge by Maxixcatzin and lodged in his palace; Alvarado became the\r\nguest of old Xicotencatl, and the others received every attention.\r\nThe reception concluded with a series of festivities.[900]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [845] ‘Esto despues lo declararon los mismos Indios.’\r\n     _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 143.

Mex._, ii. 185-6.\r\n\r\n     [848] ‘Llegado á la dicha ciudad de Tacuba, hallé toda la\r\n     gente remolinada en una plaza, que no sabían dónde ir.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 136. ‘Hasta cerca de Tlacupan hasta un\r\n     lugar que se llama _Tilihucan_.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._,\r\n     33. ‘Tacuba ... is at the present day chiefly noted for the\r\n     large and noble church which was erected there by Cortez.’\r\n     _Latrobe’s Rambler_, 128.\r\n\r\n     [849] Gomara assumes that the Tlacopan people were not\r\n     aware of the broken condition of the troops. Now they\r\n     joined the 40,000 Mexicans who had set forth prepared for\r\n     pursuit. _Hist. Mex._, 161. ‘Yà auian venido de Mexico....\r\n     dar mandado a Tacuba, y a Escapuçalco, y a Tenayuca, para\r\n     que nos saliessen al encuentro.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 106. The Mexicans were disgusted with those of\r\n     Tlacopan for their neglect. _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x.\r\n     cap. xii.\r\n\r\n     [850] ‘Un Angel de Guarda, ó San Pedro, como otros quieren,\r\n     ó Santiago Apostol,’ observes the enthusiastic Lorenzana. _Cortés_,\r\n     _Hist. N. España_, 145.\r\n\r\n     [851] ‘Totolpec.’ _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 302;\r\n     Toltotepec is Vetancurt’s misspelling. ‘Cerro llamado de\r\n     Muteczuma.’ _Lorenzana_, ubi sup.\r\n\r\n     [852] ‘Una torre y aposento fuerte.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     136. ‘Vnas caserias q̄ en vn cerro estauan, y alli jũto a vn\r\n     Cu, e adoratorio, y como fortaleza.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 107. ‘A este templo llamaron de la Vitoria, y\r\n     despues nuestra Señora de los remedios.’ _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. x. cap. xii. Sahagun calls the rise Acueco, and\r\n     places upon it the Otomí village of Otoncapulco. _Hist.\r\n     Conq._ (ed. 1840), 122. Vetancurt follows, _Teatro Mex._,\r\n     pt. iii. 143, while Camargo calls it Tzacuyocan. The\r\n     variations in Sahagun’s editions lead Torquemada to say that\r\n     the Spaniards moved the same day from Otoncalpulco pueblo\r\n     to Acueco, an Otomí village, i. 504-5. This, Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg follows. The Spaniards may have passed through it\r\n     on departing, but would hardly move from a stronghold to a\r\n     probably open village while surrounded by enemies. If food\r\n     was the object, the able-bodied soldiers would have made a\r\n     sally for it. It appears that the army camped for the night\r\n     on the hill now occupied by the Remedios shrine, and in the\r\n     fortress-like temple, to which a small village was attached.\r\n     Alzate, however, who took pains to inquire into the subject,\r\n     found that the natives applied the name Otoncapulco, not\r\n     to the Remedios hill, but to the mountain, three fourths\r\n     of a league off. On this mountain he found the ruins of a\r\n     strong building, and none on the hill, whence he assumes\r\n     that the camp was not made on the site of the shrine, but\r\n     on the mountain. _Gacetas de Lit._, ii. 457-9. Bustamante\r\n     accepts this view, but Archbishop Lorenzana, whose testimony in the\r\n     matter must be reliable, says: ‘Se conservan aun algunos\r\n     vestigios de la antigua Fortaleza, y esta se ha convertido\r\n     dichosamente en el célebre Santuario de N. Sra. de los\r\n     Remedios.’ _Cortés_, _Hist. N. España_, p. xiii. He also\r\n     intimates that the Otoncapulco name is misapplied. Hence it\r\n     may be assumed that the common application of Otoncapulco\r\n     to this hill is due to a misinterpretation of Sahagun’s\r\n     versions, which have been greatly tampered with, for that\r\n     matter, and that the ruins mentioned by Lorenzana had disappeared\r\n     by the time Alzate examined the place.\r\n\r\n     [853] _Cartas_, 136; _Cabrera_, _Escudo Armas_, 110. ‘Aqui se\r\n     señalò mucho Gonçalo Dominguez, hombre diestro y valiente.’\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xii. Prescott makes several\r\n     blunders and omissions in connection with this day.\r\n\r\n     [854] A few stragglers managed to reach the camp, and\r\n     among them one Sopuerta, who had escaped death by feigning\r\n     it. _Herrera_, ubi sup. Sahagun states that Otomís from\r\n     Teucalhuican, and from the immediate neighborhood, no doubt,\r\n     brought food, and invited the Spaniards to the former town,\r\n     a few leagues from there. _Hist. Conq._, 33. Torquemada\r\n     follows him, but the story is probably an exaggeration.\r\n\r\n     [855] It has been shown previously, by testimony not\r\n     accessible till later years, that the image placed in\r\n     the great temple was a picture on a tablet, while that of\r\n     Remedios is a doll. But, of course, the image that could\r\n     move through the air could also transform its shape. Bernal\r\n     Diaz assumes, as we have seen, that Montezuma had ordered\r\n     the image to be cared for; yet many believe that Rodriguez\r\n     secured it before or after the massacre, while the more\r\n     pious prefer to suppose that he could not find it, for want\r\n     of time, perhaps, and that it moved miraculously to the\r\n     camp. _Acosta_, _Hist. Ind._, 524; _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 302. After the departure of the troops the image\r\n     hid itself on the spot, or Rodriguez, tired of the burden\r\n     which had saved his life, ungratefully left it there. It\r\n     is also supposed to have been carried to Tlascala ere it\r\n     reappeared on its later site. _Cabrera_, _Escudo Armas_,\r\n     106 et seq.; _Alaman_, _Disert._, i. 122. Lorenzana accepts\r\n     it as the image from Mexico’s temple. _Cortés_, _Hist. N.\r\n     España_, 138.\r\n\r\n     [856] It has frequently been brought to Mexico, and is\r\n     still brought to avert epidemics and other ills, to bring\r\n     rain or other blessings. When detained it would travel\r\n     back of its own accord to the shrine, a proof of which was\r\n     afforded by the travel stains on the dress. One rainy night\r\n     it arrived covered with mud. _Latrobe’s Rambler_, 133.\r\n     Thompson describes it as ‘a little alabaster doll, with the\r\n     nose broken, and the eye out ... about eight inches high.’\r\n     Her wardrobe and jewels are valued at over $1,000,000.\r\n     _Recollections_, 103-9. He gives an account of the veneration\r\n     for the image and its miraculous power. The history of its\r\n     origin and worship is to be found in a multitude of books,\r\n     among which may be mentioned, _Medina_, _Chrón. S. Diego\r\n     Mex._, 30 et seq.; _Cabrera_, _Escudo Armas_, 106 et seq.;\r\n     _Bustamante_, _Mem. Piedad Mex._, 1-52.\r\n\r\n     [857] Cortés prudently limits, and we must add untruthfully,\r\n     the loss to 150 soldiers and some 2000 allies. It is with\r\n     a view to this estimate that he reduced the force brought\r\n     into Mexico to 570 men, to which must be added the 140\r\n     composing the garrison. Deducting the 150 lost, 560 remain,\r\n     and since he would hardly overestimate the number, for\r\n     obvious reasons, this figure is probably near the truth.\r\n     Bernal Diaz musters 1300 at Tlascala, and has 80 at Mexico.\r\n     Deducting from this 800 men stated to have been lost before\r\n     entering Tlascala, not counting those who fell in other\r\n     provinces, leaves about 580; yet he acknowledges only\r\n     440 alive. _Hist. Verdad._, 108 et seq. Herrera is also\r\n     contradictory, admitting in one place 500, and in another\r\n     ‘less than’ 400 soldiers and 600 allies. Oviedo reduces the\r\n     soldiers to 340. iii. 513. Vetancurt adopts Bernal Diaz’\r\n     440 soldiers and Herrera’s 600 allies. Prescott hastily\r\n     declares Gomara as nearest to the truth, yet he departs from\r\n     him in the result. With regard to the allies, he reckons\r\n     the full number of all who were brought to Mexico, while it\r\n     is pretty obvious, from figures and facts, that a portion\r\n     must have been allowed to return home during the inaction\r\n     of the emperor’s captivity. The list of losses, as given\r\n     by different authorities, stands as follows: 150 soldiers,\r\n     over 2000 allies, _Cortés_; over 200 soldiers, over 2000\r\n     allies, _Lejalde_, _Probanza_; nearly 200 soldiers, over\r\n     1000 allies, _Solis_; 300 soldiers, over 2000 allies, at\r\n     one bridge, _Sahagun_, 122; 450 soldiers, 4000 allies,\r\n     _Gomara_, followed by Ixtlilxochitl, Clavigero, Camargo,\r\n     and others; over 500 soldiers in all New Spain, _Carta del\r\n     Ejército_; over 600 soldiers, _Robertson_; over 600 soldiers,\r\n     _B. V. de Tapia_, in _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_,\r\n     38; 800 soldiers in all New Spain, _Cortés_, _Residencia_,\r\n     i. 42; 870 soldiers in all New Spain, _Bernal Diaz_; 1170\r\n     soldiers, 8000 allies, _Cano_, in _Oviedo_, iii. 551.\r\n\r\n     [858] The loss in horses varies from 45, in _Cortés_, to\r\n     56, in _Lejalde_, _Probanza_, both acknowledging 24 left.\r\n\r\n     [859] ‘Perdidose todo el oro y joyas y ropa,’ etc. _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 135. It had been confided to Tlascaltecs, and was\r\n     nearly all lost, says their chief. _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._,\r\n     169-70. The officers testified afterward before public\r\n     notary: ‘Se perdió todo el dicho oro é joyas de SS. AA., é\r\n     mataron la yegua que lo traia.’ _Lejalde_, _Probanza_, in\r\n     _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 425. Two witnesses during the\r\n     residencia of Cortés stated that the general had two mares,\r\n     one given to carry the royal treasures and the other laden\r\n     with his own. The latter being lost, he claimed the other\r\n     to be his, and in this manner appropriated 45,000 pesos or\r\n     more which belonged to the king. _Cortés_, _Residencia_,\r\n     i. 69, 101-2. Not long after the retreat he called on all\r\n     to declare, under penalty, what gold they had saved of that\r\n     taken from the unappropriated piles. From those who did so\r\n     the treasures were taken, although it was understood that\r\n     they had been given to them. All this Cortés kept. _Id._,\r\n     101-2, 241-2; ii. 402. Many refused to surrender, and since\r\n     the leaders had also secured shares from the common pile,\r\n     the order to reveal possession thereof was not enforced,\r\n     says Bernal Diaz. He adds that one third was to be retained\r\n     by the possessor as a reward. Cortés kept as a forced loan\r\n     what had been surrendered. _Hist. Verdad._, 117-18. The\r\n     loss of treasure, that thrown away by carriers and pressed\r\n     soldiers, or sunken with their bodies, has been estimated at\r\n     from several hundred thousand pesos to over two millions,\r\n     in the values of that time; to which Wilson sarcastically\r\n     objects, that ‘nothing was really lost but the _imaginary\r\n     treasure_, now grown inconveniently large, and which had\r\n     to be accounted for to the emperor. The _Conquistador_ was\r\n     too good a soldier to hazard his gold; it was therefore in\r\n     the advance, and came safely off.’ _Conq. Mex._, 412-13.\r\n\r\n     [860] ‘Si esta cosa fuera de dia, por ventura no murieran\r\n     tantos,’ adds Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 161. While grieving he\r\n     recognized ‘el manifiesto milagro que la reyna de los angeles\r\n     su abogada, el apostol San Pedro, y el de los egércitos\r\n     Españoles Santiago, habian hecho en haberse escapado él.’\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 302. Vetancurt moralizes on\r\n     the flight as a chastisement by God, who saved the remnant\r\n     to spread the faith. _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 145-6.\r\n\r\n     [861] On a later page Bernal Diaz says he fell at Otumba.\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 107, 246.\r\n\r\n     [862] Herrera attempts to save somewhat the reputation of\r\n     the astrologer by the statement that he prophesied death\r\n     for himself or his brother.\r\n\r\n     [863] Every one, say Cortés and Herrera; but Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     states that one sister of King Cacama was saved, and he\r\n     intimates that one or two of his brothers also escaped.\r\n     He is contradictory, however. _Hist. Chich._, 302, 390.\r\n     The one who escaped must have been Cuicuitzcatl, the newly\r\n     made king of Tezcuco. Brasseur de Bourbourg adds two of\r\n     his brothers, probably from misinterpreting Ixtlilxochitl.\r\n     _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 339.\r\n\r\n     [864] Ixtlilxochitl names some of the chiefs to whom these\r\n     offers were made. _Hist. Chich._, 302.\r\n\r\n     [865] Ávila, a veritable martinet, maimed a soldier with\r\n     a blow for stepping from the ranks to pluck some fruit.\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xii. The same story has\r\n     been told of Ávila in Cempoala.\r\n\r\n     [866] Cortés allows the five scouts to defeat the enemy,\r\n     who are frightened by the supposition that a larger force\r\n     is upon them. _Cartas_, 137. Herrera is more explicit\r\n     with regard to the ambuscade, and makes Ordaz lead up the\r\n     reinforcements. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xii.\r\n\r\n     [867] ‘Mas no cenar.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 162. Sahagun\r\n     states, however, that this was the town to which the Otomís\r\n     had on the preceding day invited them, chiefly because\r\n     they were related to the Otomís of the Tlascaltec division\r\n     under Cortés. _Hist. Conq._, 34-5. A risky proceeding,\r\n     if true, for an isolated community, on whom might fall\r\n     the vengeance of the hostile Mexicans. In the account of\r\n     the route followed to Tlascala Cortés is still the best\r\n     guide, for he not only kept a record, but wrote his report\r\n     while the occurrences were yet fresh. He is wanting in\r\n     details, however, and fails to give names to localities.\r\n     These omissions are remedied by Sahagun, who now seems\r\n     more reliable. Other authors are vague or misleading for\r\n     the route, but the occasional incidents told by them are\r\n     noteworthy. Bernal Diaz indicates only one stopping place,\r\n     Quauhtitlan evidently, before Otumba is reached. Camargo\r\n     skips to a place adjoining Otumba, and Ixtlilxochitl takes\r\n     the army to Quauhximalpan, a place which modern maps locate\r\n     south of Remedios. He resumes the northern route, but names\r\n     some towns that cannot be identified. Gomara adheres pretty\r\n     well to Cortés, but his commentator, Chimalpain, supplies\r\n     names for places, which differ from Sahagun and indicate a\r\n     deviation from the extreme northern course, as will be seen.\r\n     Torquemada follows chiefly Sahagun, whom he recommends.\r\n     Orozco y Berra has closely studied the journey, and throws\r\n     much light on it, more so than any other writer; yet his\r\n     conclusions are not always satisfactory. _Itinerario del\r\n     Ejercito Español_, in _Mex. Not. Ciudad._, 246 et seq. I have\r\n     already spoken at length, in _Native Races_, iii. 231-6,\r\n     on the life and writings of Father Sahagun, and will here\r\n     refer only to the twelfth book of his _Historia General_,\r\n     inserted by Bustamante, at the beginning of the set, under\r\n     the title of _Historia de la Conquista de Mexico_. This\r\n     copy is from one found by Muñoz in the Franciscan convent\r\n     of Tolosa, in Navarre. Another copy of the twelfth book,\r\n     in possession of Conde de Cortina, claimed as the true\r\n     original, was published separately by the same editor, at\r\n     Mexico, 1840, with lengthy notes from Clavigero and other\r\n     writers to complete the chain of events, and to comment on\r\n     the suppression in the former issue of statements concerning\r\n     Spanish misdeeds. It has also an additional chapter. Neither\r\n     copy, however, corresponds quite to that used by Torquemada,\r\n     who in more than one instance quotes passages that are\r\n     startling compared with the modified expressions in the\r\n     others. The severity of the friar toward Spanish conquerors\r\n     was no doubt a strong reason for the suppression of his\r\n     work. The twelfth book begins with Grijalva’s arrival and\r\n     the omens preceding it, and carries the narrative of the\r\n     conquest down to the fall of Mexico. According to his own\r\n     statement, on page 132, it is founded to a great extent on\r\n     the relations given him by eye-witnesses, soldiers who had\r\n     assumed the Franciscan robe and associated daily with the\r\n     friar; but much is adopted, with little or no critique,\r\n     from superstitious natives, the whole forming a rather\r\n     confusing medley, so that it is difficult to extract the\r\n     many valuable points which it contains. This difficulty is,\r\n     of course, not encountered by such followers as Bustamante\r\n     and Brasseur de Bourbourg, and similar supporters of native\r\n     records or anti-Spanish versions.\r\n\r\n     In the _Native Races_ I give the traits which characterize\r\n     the French abbé and his famous works on Central American\r\n     culture and antiquities, and it remains only to refer\r\n     briefly to his version of the conquest, comprised in the\r\n     fourth volume of the _Histoire des Nations Civilisées_.\r\n     His pleasing style lends attraction to every page, but his\r\n     faults become more conspicuous from the comparison presented\r\n     by a vast array of authorities, revealing the indiscreet\r\n     and enthusiastic readiness to accept native tales, or\r\n     anything that favors the hypotheses by which he is ruled,\r\n     and in the disposition to build magnificent structures on\r\n     airy foundation. His version, indeed, strives rather to\r\n     narrate the conquest from a native standpoint, and to use\r\n     Spanish chronicles only as supplementary authority. To\r\n     this end he relies chiefly on the now well known writings\r\n     of Sahagun, Ixtlilxochitl, Camargo, and Torquemada, and it\r\n     is but rarely that he is able to quote the often startling\r\n     original manuscripts possessed only by himself.\r\n\r\n     [868] ‘Mordiendo la tierra, arrancando yeruas, y alçãdo los\r\n     ojos al cielo, dezian, dioses no nos desampareys en este\r\n     peligro, pues teneys poder sobre todos los hombres, hazed\r\n     que con vuestra ayuda salgamos del.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii.\r\n     lib. x. cap. xii.\r\n\r\n     [869] Herrera conforms to Cortés and Gomara in admitting a\r\n     stay of two nights at one place, but makes this Tecopatlan,\r\n     called ‘duck town,’ from its many fowl. This is evidently\r\n     Tepotzotlan. But it was not near the lake like Citlaltepec,\r\n     and ‘duck town’ applies rather to a lake town, in this\r\n     region, at least. Cortés also writes, in _Cartas_, 137,\r\n     ‘fuimos aquel dia por cerca de unas lagunas hasta que\r\n     llegamos á una poblacion,’ and this does not apply well\r\n     to Tepotzotlan, which lies a goodly distance from the\r\n     lakes, requiring certainly no march along ‘some’ lakes to\r\n     reach it. Hence the Citlaltepec of Sahagun must be meant.\r\n     This author, however, supposes the Spaniards to stay one\r\n     night at each place. _Hist. Conq._, 36 (ed. 1840), 129.\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl calls the place after Tepotzotlan, Aychqualco.\r\n     _Hist. Chich._, 302. At Tepotzotlan, says Vetancurt, some\r\n     of the people remained to receive the Spaniards—this is\r\n     in accordance with one of Sahagun’s versions—and here\r\n     remained to hide the son of Montezuma, whom he supposes to\r\n     have escaped with the troops. _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 144.\r\n     According to Chimalpain’s interpretation the Spaniards stay\r\n     the two nights at Quauhtitlan, and thence proceed by way of\r\n     Ecatepec, now San Cristóbal, skirting the northern shore of\r\n     Tezcuco Lake, and on to Otumba. _Hist. Conq._, i. 304-5.\r\n     This route certainly appears the most direct, but there\r\n     is no authority for it. The sentence from Cortés might no\r\n     doubt be adopted equally well for this road; but Sahagun,\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl, and Herrera name towns which lie east and\r\n     north of the Zumpango Lake, and during the rainy season\r\n     now prevailing the passages between the lakes were rather\r\n     swampy. Tezcuco was beside too close for the fleeing army.\r\n     Alaman accepts the route south of Zumpango, _Disert._, i.\r\n     122, against which nearly all the above reasons apply.\r\n\r\n     [870] ‘Nos convenia ir muchas veces fuera de camino.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 138. Owing to the guide’s inefficiency,\r\n     adds Gomara, _Hist. Mex._, 162.\r\n\r\n     [871] Sahagun also calls the mountain, or the slope, Tona.\r\n     His confusing versions sometimes reverse all the names.\r\n     Cortés places it two leagues from the last camp.\r\n\r\n     [872] ‘Detrás dél [hill] estaba una gran ciudad de mucha\r\n     gente.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 138. Zacamolco is also called a\r\n     large town. There could hardly be two large towns so close\r\n     together in a district like this, so that the other must\r\n     have been Teotihuacan, ‘city of the gods,’ with its ancient\r\n     and lofty pyramids, sacred to all Anáhuac, and one of the\r\n     chief centres of pilgrimage.

Llegado el medio dia, con el intolerable trabajo\r\n     de la pelea, los españoles comenzaron á desmayar.’ _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist.

Verdad._, 108. Ixtlilxochitl calls the gold net\r\n     _matlaxopili_. _Hist. Chich._, 303. Camargo more correctly\r\n     agrees with Torquemada.\r\n\r\n     [886] The accounts of this incident vary greatly. According\r\n     to Bernal Diaz ‘Cortes dió vn encuẽtro cõ el cauallo al\r\n     Capitã Mexicano, hizo abatir su vãdera ... quiẽ siguiò\r\n     al Capitan q̄ traia la vandera que aun no auia caido del\r\n     encuentro que Cortes le diò, fue vn Juan de Salamanca,\r\n     natural de Ontiueros, con vna buena yegua ouera, que le\r\n     acabò de matar.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 108. The banner could\r\n     not have fallen without the general. Gomara intimates that\r\n     Cortés charged alone against the ‘capitan general, y diole\r\n     dos lançadas, de que cayo y murio.’ _Hist. Mex._, 163.\r\n     This is also substantially the view of Duran and Camargo.\r\n     Herrera leaves the impression that Salamanca alone follows\r\n     Cortés in the charge, and cuts off the head and banner of\r\n     the commander after his chief had wounded and overthrown\r\n     him. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xiii. Torquemada, Clavigero,\r\n     Prescott, and others, also assume that Cortés lances the\r\n     generalissimo, but they let the cavalry follow. Sahagun, who\r\n     obtained his information from participants that afterward\r\n     became friars, merely states that Cortés and one other led\r\n     the charge, which resulted in the overthrow of the general\r\n     and his banner. _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 132. Cortés\r\n     is still more reticent in saying: ‘quiso Dios que murió\r\n     una persona dellos, que debia ser tan principal, que con\r\n     su muerte cesó toda aquella guerra.’ _Cartas_, 139. The\r\n     assumption that Cortés overthrew the commander with his\r\n     lance rests chiefly on the fact that Cortés as leader of\r\n     the charge receives credit for everything that happens.\r\n     Writers also forget that the commander was carried aloft in\r\n     a litter the better to observe the movements of the army.\r\n     His burdened carriers would with greater likelihood have\r\n     been overthrown by the horses or in the disorder created\r\n     by their advance. This supposition is confirmed by Cortés’\r\n     reference to the affair, wherein he gives credit to none\r\n     for the act, his usual custom when some one else performed\r\n     a noteworthy deed. He was seldom chary in giving credit to\r\n     himself for achievements, as may be gathered alone from his\r\n     account of the stay in Mexico City, which announces that\r\n     he it was who tore down the idols, who captured the temple\r\n     after another had failed to do so, who single-handed covered\r\n     the retreat of his comrades on the Tlacopan causeway on\r\n     the morning preceding the flight, and who with less than a\r\n     score that ‘dared stay with him’ protected the retreat of\r\n     the last remnant from the city. The supposition receives\r\n     further support from the permission given by the emperor to\r\n     Salamanca to add to his escutcheon the trophy taken from\r\n     the commander. This implies that although the victory was\r\n     due to Cortés he could not have inflicted the mortal wound.\r\n     Salamanca became alcalde mayor of Goazacoalco. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 108, 111.\r\n\r\n     [887] ‘Los principales, lleuarõ cõ grã llanto, el cuerpo de\r\n     su general,’ says Herrera; but this is doubtful, to judge\r\n     also from his subsequent observations.\r\n\r\n     [888] ‘Murieron ... casi todos los amigos de los españoles,\r\n     y algunos de ellos mismos.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._ (ed.\r\n     1840), 132. Solis acknowledges only wounded, of whom two\r\n     or three died afterward. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 203. Cortés did\r\n     not escape additional wounds, from which he was soon to\r\n     suffer intensely.\r\n\r\n     [889] The natives were particularly ready to testify to\r\n     this supernatural aid, as Camargo relates, _Hist. Tlax._,\r\n     172, perhaps for their own credit, as good converts and\r\n     brave warriors.\r\n\r\n     [890] ‘Never,’ writes Gomara, ‘did a man show such prowess as\r\n     he, and never were men so well led. He by his own personal\r\n     efforts saved them.’ _Hist. Mex._, 163. ‘Se tuuo la vitoria\r\n     despues de Dios, por el valor de Cortés.’ _Herrera_, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. x. cap. xiii. While quite prepared to uphold the\r\n     general as a hero, Bernal Diaz takes exception to this\r\n     praise as unjust to his many followers, who not only did\r\n     wonders in sustaining him, but in saving his life. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 111.\r\n\r\n     [891] Ixtlilxochitl assumes that another army was encountered\r\n     and routed with great slaughter, a few leagues ahead, at\r\n     Teyocan. _Hist. Chich._, 303.\r\n\r\n     [892] _Ixtlilxochitl._ Chimalpain calls it Apam, which\r\n     appears to have been situated farther north. Lorenzana\r\n     refers to all this extent as the plains of Apan, the name\r\n     which it now bears. Camargo names the plains of Apantema,\r\n     Tacacatitlan, and Atlmoloyan as traversed by the army to\r\n     reach Tlascala. _Hist. Tlax._, 172.\r\n\r\n     [893] _Cartas_, 140. ‘Pues quizà sabiamos cierto, que nos\r\n     auian de ser leales, ò que voluntad ternian.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 108.\r\n\r\n     [894] Brasseur de Bourbourg gives to a village here\r\n     the name of Xaltelolco. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 352.\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl refers to it as Huexoyotlipan, and states\r\n     that Citlalquiauhtzin came up with food and presents from\r\n     the lords.\r\n\r\n     [895] Cortés calls the town Gualipan; Bernal Diaz, Gualiopar;\r\n     Gomara, Huazilipan; Herrera gives it 2000 houses.\r\n\r\n     [896] ‘Yo queria,’ said Maxixcatzin, ‘yr en vuestra busca\r\n     con treynta mil guerreros.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     109. This is confirmed by the Aztec version of Duran, which\r\n     says that the rumor of Tlascaltec preparations helped to\r\n     intimidate the proposed Mexican reinforcements for Otumba.\r\n     _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 483. According to Oviedo, 50,000\r\n     warriors, followed by 20,000 carriers, met the Spaniards\r\n     at the frontier, iii. 514. Camargo extends the number to\r\n     200,000, ‘who came too late, but served nevertheless to\r\n     check pursuit from the enemy.’ _Hist. Tlax._, 173. Gomara\r\n     stamps Oviedo’s statement as hearsay, but adds that the\r\n     Tlascaltecs declared themselves prepared to return with\r\n     the Spaniards at once against Mexico. This Cortés declined\r\n     to do for the present, but allowed a few soldiers to join\r\n     a band in pursuit of marauding stragglers. _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     164. The delay in collecting the proposed reinforcements\r\n     may have been due to the small faction hostile to the\r\n     Spaniards, headed by the captain-general, Xicotencatl the\r\n     younger, who seems never to have forgiven the disgrace of\r\n     defeat which they had been the first to inflict upon him. He\r\n     had accompanied the lords to Hueyotlipan, perhaps to gloat\r\n     over the misfortune of his victors. According to Herrera,\r\n     Captain Juan Paez—Torquemada writes Perez—was one of the\r\n     invalids at Tlascala, and to him 100,000 warriors had been\r\n     offered to go to the aid of his general; but he declined,\r\n     on the ground that his strict orders were to remain with\r\n     his 80 men at Tlascala. For this he was naturally upbraided\r\n     by Cortés as a coward, fit for hanging. The story is not\r\n     very probable. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xiv,; _Torquemada_,\r\n     i. 512.\r\n\r\n     [897] ‘Que estimó él mucho, y puso por una de sus armas.’\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 303.\r\n\r\n     [898] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 140. Bernal Diaz intimates one day.\r\n\r\n     [899] ‘Cõ mas de duzientos mil hombres en orden: yuan las\r\n     mugeres, y niños, en la delantera.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii.\r\n     lib. x. cap. xiii. This order may have been intended to\r\n     signify peace and welcome.\r\n\r\n     [900] Camargo differs from Bernal Diaz, in intimating that\r\n     all were lodged in Maxixcatzin’s palace, while Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     assumes that Cortés was the guest of Xicotencatl. ‘Magiscacin\r\n     me trajo una cama de madera encajada, con alguna ropa ... y\r\n     á todos hizo reparar de lo que él tuvo.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     141.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nINVALUABLE FRIENDSHIP.\r\n\r\nJULY-SEPTEMBER, 1520.\r\n\r\n     DIVERS DISASTERS TO THE SPANIARDS—MEXICO MAKES OVERTURES\r\n     TO TLASCALA—A COUNCIL HELD—TLASCALA REMAINS TRUE TO THE\r\n     SPANIARDS—DISAFFECTION IN THE SPANISH ARMY—CORTÉS AGAIN\r\n     WINS THE SOLDIERS TO HIS VIEWS—RENEWAL OF ACTIVE OPERATIONS\r\n     AGAINST THE AZTECS—SUCCESS OF THE SPANISH ARMS—LARGE\r\n     REINFORCEMENTS OF NATIVE ALLIES—ONE AZTEC STRONGHOLD AFTER\r\n     ANOTHER SUCCUMBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Tlascala were certain invalid Spaniards, who praised the natives for\r\ntheir kind treatment, and for the almost universal sympathy exhibited\r\nwith regard to the misfortunes at Mexico. The army now learned\r\nthat disaster had also befallen the Spaniards in other parts of the\r\ncountry. The news of the flight had spread with marvellous rapidity,\r\nand Cuitlahuatzin’s envoys had not failed to magnify the successes\r\nof his arms while urging throughout the country the extermination of\r\nthe invaders. This advice had found ready acceptance in the provinces\r\nwest and south of Tlascala, which had additional reasons for hostility\r\nin the assumption of the little republic since she became the ally\r\nof the strangers.\r\n\r\nShortly after the departure of the army from the coast a party of\r\nfifty men with five horses had followed with baggage and valuables. At\r\nTlascala a portion of them, with two horses, under Juan de Alcántara\r\nsenior, received the portion of treasure set aside during the late\r\nrepartition for the coast garrison, estimated at sixty thousand pesos.\r\nWith this they set out on their return to Villa Rica, accompanied by\r\na few invalids. On the way they were surprised and slaughtered, the\r\ntreasures and effects being distributed as spoils.[901]\r\n\r\nThe larger division of the party, under the hidalgo Juan Yuste,[902]\r\nwhich were to join Cortés, also picked up some convalescents, together\r\nwith additional treasure and baggage, and proceeded to Mexico by\r\nthe way of Calpulalpan. They numbered five horsemen, forty-five\r\nfoot-soldiers, and three hundred Tlascaltecs, the latter under command\r\nof one of Maxixcatzin’s sons. Advised of their approach the natives of\r\nZultepec, among others, were induced, more by cupidity than patriotic\r\nzeal, to form an ambuscade along the steep declivity of a narrow\r\npass which had to be followed. Here they fell upon the party on all\r\nsides as they descended in single file, encumbered beside by their\r\nburdens. Resistance was ineffective, and those not slain were carried\r\nto Tezcuco to be offered up to the idols, while their effects were\r\ndistributed, some of the trophies being dedicated to temples of the\r\nAcolhuan capital, there to tell the mournful tale to the returning\r\nconquerors.[903]\r\n\r\nAbout this time a vessel arrived at Villa Rica with three or four\r\nscore of adventurers, under Captain Coronado, and being told of the\r\nfabulously rich Mexico they resolved to lose no time in following\r\nthe army, in order to secure a share of treasures. It was just after\r\nthe flight from Mexico, and the provinces were in arms, elated at the\r\ntriumphs at the lake. On approaching the Tepeaca district the party\r\nwas surprised, and partly slaughtered, partly captured, the prisoners\r\nbeing distributed among the towns of the province for sacrifice.[904]\r\n\r\nThese reports created no small alarm for the safety of Villa Rica, and\r\nseveral Tlascaltec messengers were sent with letters, by different\r\nroutes, to bring news. Orders were also given to the comandante to\r\nforward powder, fire-arms, bows, and other necessaries that he could\r\nspare, together with some men, sailors, if no others were available.\r\nThe reply was reassuring, for although the natives had fuller\r\nparticulars of the disaster at Mexico than Cortés had chosen to impart\r\nto the garrison, yet everything remained quiet. The remittance of war\r\nmaterial was small, and the men who convoyed it numbered less than\r\na dozen, men stricken by disease, and led by Lencero, who became the\r\nbutt of the _drôles de corps_.[905]\r\n\r\nEvery attention and comfort was tendered at Tlascala to the Spaniards\r\nwhile caring for their wounds and awaiting the development of projects.\r\nHardly a man had arrived scathless, and quite a number had received\r\ninjuries which maimed them for life or resulted in death.[906] Cortés’\r\nwounds were most serious. The indomitable spirit which sustained him\r\nso far now yielded with the failing body. Severe scalp cuts brought\r\non fever,[907] which caused his life to hang in the balance for\r\nsome time. Finally his strong constitution and the excellent empiric\r\nmethods of the native herb doctors prevailed, to the joy, not alone\r\nof Spaniards, but of Tlascaltecs, who had shown the utmost anxiety\r\nduring the crisis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring this period of Spanish inaction the Mexicans were energetically\r\nstriving to follow up their blow against the invaders. The first act\r\nafter ridding the capital of their presence was one of purgation,\r\nin which the victorious party fell on those whose lukewarmness,\r\nor whose friendly disposition toward Montezuma and his guests, had\r\nhindered the siege operations and aided the enemy. A tumult was soon\r\nraised, wherein perished four royal princes, brothers and sons of\r\nMontezuma,[908] whose death may be attributed to Cuitlahuatzin’s\r\ndesire to remove any dangerous rival to the throne. Not that this was\r\na necessary precaution, since his standing, as a younger brother of\r\nMontezuma, and his successful operations against the Spaniards, were\r\nsufficient to raise him above every other candidate.[909] Furthermore,\r\nas commander-in-chief of the army and as leader of the successful\r\nparty, he held the key to the position, and accordingly was unanimously\r\nchosen. About the same time Cohuanacoch was elected king at Tezcuco,\r\nin lieu of the younger brother forced on the people by Cortés, and\r\nQuauhtemotzin, nephew of Montezuma, rose to the office of high-priest\r\nto Huitzilopochtli. The coronation was the next prominent event,[910]\r\nfor which the indispensable captives had already been secured from\r\nthe fleeing army. What more precious victims, indeed, could have been\r\ndesired for the inaugural than the powerful Spaniards and the hated\r\nwarriors of brave Tlascala? And what grander site for the ceremony\r\nthan the great temple, recovered from the detested intruders and\r\npurified from foreign emblems? In connection with this came a series\r\nof festivals.[911]\r\n\r\nThe utmost activity was displayed in repairing the damage caused\r\nby the Spaniards, and in fortifying the city and its approaches\r\nagainst a possible future invasion. The construction and discipline\r\nof the army were improved in some degree after the examples given\r\nby the Europeans; its tactics were revised, and its arms perfected\r\nwith the aid of captured weapons, the Chinantec pike being also\r\nintroduced and tipped with Toledo blades or other metal points.\r\nEnvoys were despatched to near and distant provinces, bidding for\r\ntheir support by remission of taxes and tributes, by restoration of\r\nconquered territories, by patriotic appeals, and by roseate views\r\nand promises.[912] The Spaniards were painted as selfish, perfidious,\r\nand cruel, intent on conquering the whole country, on enslaving the\r\npeople, on extorting their substance, and on overthrowing social and\r\nreligious institutions. Spoils and heads of Spanish men and horses were\r\nsent round to disabuse the people of their supposed invulnerability;\r\nand as a further encouragement the dreaded Cortés was declared to\r\nhave fallen.\r\n\r\nThe most important missions were those to Michoacan and Tlascala,\r\nthe former an independent kingdom of considerable extent, stretching\r\nwestward beyond the lake region to the Pacific, over an undulating,\r\nwell watered territory, which abounded in all the resources of a rich\r\nsoil and a tropic climate. The inhabitants, the Tarascos, were distinct\r\nfrom the Aztecs in language, but fully their equals in culture, which\r\nwas of the Nahua type, and as a rule successful in resisting the\r\narmed encroachments of the lake allies. The present ruler was Zwanga,\r\nwho held court at Tzintzuntzan, on Lake Patzcuaro. He received the\r\nembassadors of Cuitlahuatzin with due attention, but hesitated about\r\nthe answer to be given. The Aztecs had from time immemorial been\r\nthe enemies of his people, and to aid them would surely bring upon\r\nhim the wrath of the Spaniards, who must still be powerful, since\r\nthe Mexicans came to plead for his alliance. In this dilemma it was\r\nresolved, with the advice of the council, to send plenipotentiaries\r\nto Mexico, in order to learn more fully the condition of affairs,\r\nand there determine what should be done.[913]\r\n\r\nMore decisive in its results was the mission to Tlascala. Regarded\r\nas the most important of all, it was intrusted to six prominent\r\nmen, of acknowledged talent for negotiation. They came fortified\r\nwith choice presents of robes, feathers, salt, and similar desirable\r\ncommodities, and were received with customary courtesy by the assembled\r\nlords and council. The eldest was the first to speak. He recalled\r\nthe intimate relationship between Mexico and Tlascala in blood and\r\nlanguage, deplored the feud which had so long existed, and urged the\r\nestablishment of permanent peace, for mutual benefit, whereby the\r\nTlascaltecs would gain all the advantages of a long prohibited trade.\r\nOne obstacle alone interposed to prevent a happy harmony, which was the\r\npresence of the Spaniards, to whom was due the unfortunate condition\r\nof the whole country. Their only aim was to make themselves masters,\r\nto overthrow the gods of the natives, to enslave the inhabitants,\r\nand impoverish them by exactions.\r\n\r\nThe Tlascaltecs would after rendering service be treated with the\r\nsame base ingratitude and perfidy as the over generous Montezuma,\r\nand reap not only universal detestation, but the anger of the gods.\r\nBetter, therefore, to seize the present favorable opportunity to\r\ndeliver themselves from dreadful calamities, to establish prosperity\r\nand independence on a firm basis, and by a joint alliance recover the\r\nalienated provinces and share the revenues therefrom.[914] The first\r\nstep to this desirable end was the destruction of the Spaniards,\r\nnow at their mercy, whereby they would gain also the gratitude of\r\nneighboring peoples, the fame of patriots, and the blessing of the\r\ngods.\r\n\r\nThe speech delivered, together with the presents, the envoys withdrew\r\nto let the council deliberate. Bitter as was the enmity between the\r\ntwo peoples, intensified by the recent defeat, there were not wanting\r\npersons to whom the argument and offers seemed all that the most\r\nbrilliant fortune could bring. What, indeed, had they in common with\r\na strange race by whom they had been conquered, and whose presence\r\nportended many changes in their social and religious institutions,\r\ntransmitted by their forefathers, and upheld with the blood of\r\ngenerations? Their independence would be endangered. Besides, the\r\ninvaders had been shamefully defeated, and might never again hold up\r\ntheir heads. The whole country was mustering to drive them out, and,\r\nif successful, woe to Tlascala, as their ally. In any case a struggle\r\nwas in prospect, wherein their sons and brethren would be sacrificed\r\nby the thousands. And for what? For the benefit of strangers, always\r\nready with their yoke of slavery. On the other hand, they were offered\r\nthe peace so long desired, with its accompanying blessings; deliverance\r\nfrom the trade blockade and seclusion which had so long afflicted\r\nthem, together with the attractive adjunct of assured independence,\r\nand the triumphant and profitable position of conquering allies of\r\nthe Mexicans.[915]\r\n\r\nThe strongest advocate of these views was Xicotencatl junior, who\r\nhad never forgotten the several Spanish victories that checked his\r\ntriumphal career as soldier and general, and humiliated him in the\r\neyes of the whole people. Yet this feeling was tinged with love for\r\nthe independence and welfare of the country, threatened, in his eyes,\r\nby the invaders. With the news of disaster at Mexico his party had\r\nassumed respectable proportions. Some of its members were impelled by\r\nmotives similar to his own; some were bribed by Mexican gifts, and\r\npromises of wealth and preferment; some were tempted by the arms,\r\nbaggage, and treasure of the fugitives, whom it seemed easy now to\r\novercome. Not a few considered the burden of maintaining a horde of\r\nstrangers, with the prospect of afterward yielding them service and\r\nblood for their aggrandizement. When the collectors of provisions for\r\nthe Spaniards made their rounds they could not but observe the bitter\r\nfeeling which prevailed in some quarters.[916] The elder Xicotencatl\r\nappears to have remonstrated with his son for breeding trouble; but\r\nthis availed little, as may be supposed. During the deliberation\r\nof the council on the Mexican proposal the young chieftain stepped\r\nbeyond the timid suggestions of those who inclined toward an Aztec\r\nalliance, and boldly advocated it as the only salvation for Tlascala.\r\n\r\nNext spoke the wise Maxixcatzin, the leading representative of the\r\nrepublic. In his chivalrous nature devotion to the Spaniards exercised\r\nan influence, while as ruler of the richest district, in agriculture\r\nand trade, he had also an eye to the benefits which would accrue from\r\nan alliance with them. He recalled the many instances of treachery\r\nand want of good faith on the part of the Mexicans to show how little\r\ntheir promises could be relied on. It was merely the presence of the\r\nSpaniards that prompted their offer of alliance, which was to restore\r\nMexico to its former terrorizing strength. This accomplished, the\r\nancient enemy would not fail to remember that Tlascala, in addition\r\nto the old-standing enmity, had been one of the chief instruments in\r\ntheir late suffering and humiliation, and had figured as conqueror\r\nand master over them. They would lose no time in avenging themselves,\r\nand by the destruction of the republic remove forever so dangerous an\r\nenemy. Far better, then, to maintain the friendship of the Spaniards,\r\nwhose good faith had been tried, and whose prowess was not broken\r\nby one defeat. Previous to their arrival they had been suffering\r\nfrom the want even of necessaries, and had been exposed to incessant\r\nravages and warfare, which threatened their very existence. With the\r\nSpaniards’ aid they had been freed from this want and danger; they\r\nhad enriched themselves with trade and spoils, and had raised the\r\nrepublic to the most prominent position it had ever occupied, all\r\nfar beyond what the Mexicans would ever permit. What did the gods\r\nsay? Oracles and omens had foretold the doom of the empire. It was\r\nin vain to struggle with fate, which had decreed the control to the\r\nnew-comers. The interests of the state demanded the friendship of\r\nthese destined victors, who offered them wealth and glory, while good\r\nfaith and honor demanded loyalty to the invited guests, from whom so\r\nmany benefits had already sprung.\r\n\r\nObserving the effect of the appeal on the wavering members, young\r\nXicotencatl hastened to defend his cherished plans, but with such\r\nimprudence as to rouse Maxixcatzin to strike him. He was thereupon\r\njostled out of the council-chamber, badly bruised and with torn\r\nclothes.[917] Against this expulsion none of his supporters ventured to\r\nremonstrate, and the vote being unanimously in favor of Maxixcatzin’s\r\nviews, the Aztec envoys were notified accordingly.[918] How momentous\r\nthis discussion! And did the council of Tlascala realize the full\r\nimport of their acts? For thereby they determined the present and\r\npermanent fate of many powerful nations besides themselves. Undoubtedly\r\nthe country would at some time have fallen before the dominant power;\r\nbut, had it been possible for the nations of the great plateau to\r\ncombine and act in unison, very different might have been their\r\nultimate condition. Cortés and his company owed their safety to a\r\ndecision which kept alive discord between the native tribes, while\r\nthe Tlascaltecs were saved from what probably would have been a\r\ntreacherous alliance, perhaps from annihilation, only to sink into\r\npeaceful obscurity and merge into the mass of conquered people.[919]\r\nThey endeavored to keep the disagreement in the council-chamber a\r\nsecret from Cortés, but he heard of it, and failed not to confirm\r\nMaxixcatzin in his devotion by holding forth the most brilliant\r\nprospects as the result of this alliance. The words by which the\r\ncouncil decided for Cortés were to him as drops of perspiration on\r\nthe lately fevered brow, which tell that the crisis is passed.\r\n\r\nThere was another cloud about this time appearing on the horizon\r\nof the fortunes of Cortés. During his stay at Tlascala the men of\r\nNarvaez began again to moot the subject of return. The golden vision\r\nof Mexico’s treasures had been rudely dissipated, leaving only the\r\nremembrance of hardships and disgrace. The flowery Antilles appeared\r\nmore alluring than ever to these gold-seekers, only too many of whom\r\nwere more accustomed to the farm than to the camp. They could think of\r\nnothing but the ease and security of the fertile plantations, where\r\nnature unloaded its wealth, and where docile natives ministered to\r\nevery want. In furtherance of this idea it was urged on Cortés, by\r\nDuero and other leaders, to retire, to Villa Rica before the Mexicans\r\nhad succeeded in their efforts to cut off his retreat. There they would\r\nintrench themselves while awaiting aid from the islands and arranging\r\na fresh campaign, having the vessels to fall back on, if necessary.\r\nBut to these intimations Cortés would not for a moment listen. And\r\nthere were many reasons for this—his ambition to be all or nothing\r\nin this enterprise, his crimes against Velazquez, his irregularities\r\nregarding the king’s interests, which only brilliant success could\r\nredeem. As well might they talk to the unyielding hills; he would join\r\nhis dead comrades in the canals of Mexico, or voluntarily ascend to\r\nthe sacrificial stone, but he would not turn back from this adventure.\r\n\r\nWhen the general revealed his firm intention to renew the campaign\r\nas soon as possible, the outcry became loud. The Noche Triste and the\r\nnarrow escape at Otumba had left impressions too horrible to be easily\r\nforgotten. They shuddered at the thought of renewing such risk, and\r\ncursed the gold which had allured them to former discomfitures. If\r\nthe general wished to throw away his life he might do so, but they\r\nwere not such madmen. Moreover, it was highly imprudent to place so\r\nmuch faith in the Tlascaltecs, who might at the first encounter with\r\nthe enemy abandon or betray allies differing so greatly in language,\r\nreligion, and customs. A formal demand was therefore addressed to\r\nhim, through the notary, to return to Villa Rica, on the ground of\r\ntheir small number and dismembered condition, devoid as they were\r\nof clothing, arms, ammunition, and horses, and with so many maimed\r\nand wounded. They were wholly unfit to undertake any campaign, much\r\nless against an enemy who had just defeated them when they were far\r\nstronger in number and armament than now. Declared, as it was, in the\r\nname of the army, though in truth by the men of Narvaez only,[920]\r\nand headed by such persons as Duero, with invocation of the imperial\r\nname, the proposal placed Cortés in a dilemma. Yet it roused in him\r\nonly a firmer determination. He was more master now than ever he\r\ncould be under the new proposal; and Cortés loved to be master. The\r\nsame reasons which had moved him before to advance into Mexico in\r\nquest of independent fame and wealth, and to evade the prospective\r\ndisgrace and poverty, imprisonment and death, were reasons stronger\r\nnow than ever.\r\n\r\nHere was another of those delicate points on which the destiny of the\r\nEstremaduran seemed ever turning. Rousing himself to meet the issue,\r\nthough still weak with disease, he summoned an audience. “What is this\r\nI hear?” he asked of the assembled soldiers. “Is it true that you\r\nwould retire from the fertile fields of New Spain, you, Spaniards,\r\nCastilians, Christians! leave the ship-loads of gold which in the\r\nAztec capital we saw and handled; leave still standing the abominable\r\nidols with their bloody ministers, and tamely summon others to enjoy\r\nthe riches and glories which you are too craven to achieve? Alack!\r\nfor your patriotism, for duty to your emperor, to God, for the honor\r\nof Spanish arms! Know you not that one step further in retreat than\r\nnecessary is equivalent to the abandonment of all? Or perhaps the\r\nfault is my own. I have been too careful of mine ease, too cowardly\r\nto expose my person to the dangers into which I directed you; I\r\nhave fled before the foe—help me to remember, friends—I have left my\r\ncomrades to die unaided on the battle-field while I sought safety,\r\nI have fed while you starved, I have slept while you labored, or my\r\ntoo sluggish brain has refused the duty due by your commander.” The\r\nspeaker paused, but only for a moment. At this, the very beginning of\r\nhis plea, a hundred eyes were affectionately regarding him through\r\ntheir moisture, a hundred tongues were denying all insinuations of\r\nbaseness as applied to him, their great and brave commander. Already\r\ntheir hearts were aflame with avarice and ambition; aflame, like St\r\nAugustine’s, with Christian zeal and fervency of devotion, soldier\r\nfanatics as they were, stern, forehead-wrinkled men—for fighting\r\nmen, no less than fighting dogs, display a gravity in their every-day\r\ndemeanor unknown to tamer spirits. “Are not my interests yours, and\r\nyours mine?” continued Cortés. “Therefore, I pray you, ascribe not\r\nmy views to disregard of your wishes, but to a desire to promote the\r\ngood of all. What people going to war that does not sometimes suffer\r\ndefeat; but what brave men ever abandoned a glorious campaign because\r\nof one repulse? And do you not see that it is more dangerous to go than\r\nto remain—that to retreat further would only invite further attack?\r\nI will not allude before soldiers of mine,” concluded the speaker,\r\n“to the everlasting infamy of abandoning these brave Tlascaltecs to\r\nthe enmity of the combined forces of the plateau for having stood the\r\nSpaniards’ friend in time of danger. Go, all of you who will! abandon\r\nyour sacred trusts, and with them the riches in mines, and tributes\r\nhere awaiting you, and fair encomiendas, with countless servants\r\nto attend before your new nobility; for myself, if left alone, then\r\nalone will I here remain and general Indians, since Spaniards have\r\nall turned cowards!”\r\n\r\nHearts of steel could not withstand such words so spoken; and loud\r\ncame the shouts of approval from Cortés’ old comrades, who swore that\r\nnot a man should be allowed to endanger the common safety by leaving.\r\nThis manifestation was in itself sufficient to shame the disaffected\r\ninto resignation, although not into silence, for mutterings were\r\nfrequent against the quality of persuasion employed by the general and\r\nhis beggarly followers, who had nothing to lose except their lives.\r\nIn order somewhat to allay their discontent Cortés promised that at\r\nthe conclusion of the next campaign their wishes should be consulted,\r\nand the first favorable opportunity for departure be tendered them—a\r\ncool proposal, affecting only those who would be left of them, yet\r\nmade with sober visage by the artless Cortés.[921]\r\n\r\nThe determination of Cortés was now what it always had been, namely,\r\nto conquer and become master of all New Spain; and the greater the\r\ndifficulty the greater the glory. Fearing that further evil might\r\nresult from continued inactivity, and from remaining a burden on the\r\nallies, Cortés resolved to lose no time in taking the field.[922] In\r\nthe fertile plains to the south of Tlascala lay the rich province\r\nof Tepeyacac,[923] euphonized into Tepeaca, long hostile to the\r\nrepublic. Intimidated by the subjugation of Tlascala and Cholula, the\r\nthree brothers who ruled it[924] had tendered their submission to the\r\nconquerors, only to return to their old masters, the Aztecs, the moment\r\nfortune seemed to favor them. The latter had indeed, in connection\r\nwith their other preparations, made particular efforts to stir the\r\nprovinces round Tlascala and toward the coast, sending large garrisons\r\nto form centres for the native armies, the object being partly to cut\r\noff communication with the coast, so as to prevent reinforcements from\r\nreaching the Spaniards, and partly to effect a rear movement when it\r\nmight be decided to attack the republic. Reinforcements had already\r\nbeen surprised in this region and slaughtered, as we have seen, and\r\nraids had been made on the allied frontier.\r\n\r\nHere was all the cause the Spaniards required for attack, and as the\r\ncountry was for the most part open, the horsemen would have great\r\nadvantage over native troops. Its subjugation, therefore, promised\r\nto be easy, and would secure the rear. The Tlascaltecs approved\r\nof beginning the campaign with the outlying provinces,[925] where\r\nthe concentration of forces was smaller, and where the memory of\r\nAztec misrule and oppression might readily induce the inhabitants\r\nto transfer their allegiance, so as to strengthen the conquerors\r\nand allure fresh allies. They were eager to begin the campaign, and\r\noffered a large force of warriors. Xicotencatl junior also evinced a\r\npromptness to coöperate, as if to remove any ill feeling that might\r\nhave arisen from his machinations.[926] In order to thoroughly enlist\r\ntheir sympathies Cortés made an arrangement with the lords whereby\r\na number of privileges were assured to their people, together with\r\na fixed proportion of the spoils[927] to be obtained during the war.\r\n\r\nThe troops were mustered at Tzompantzinco, near Tlascala, amidst a\r\nlarge concourse of people. There were about four hundred and fifty\r\nSpanish soldiers, with nearly twenty horses, a few firelocks and\r\nfield-pieces, and a number of cross-bows, but the arms were chiefly\r\nswords and pikes. The reinforcements consisted of six thousand\r\nTlascaltecs, including a few Cholultecs and Huexotzincas, a larger\r\nforce being prepared under Xicotencatl to follow later.[928] A demand\r\nhad meanwhile been sent to Tepeaca to confirm the oath of allegiance\r\nonce tendered the Spanish sovereign and dismiss the Aztec garrisons,\r\nwhereupon all past offences would be forgiven. The reply was a\r\ncontemptuous refusal, with the threat that any attempt at coercion\r\nwould bring upon the invaders worse punishment than they had received\r\nat Mexico, for they all would be dished up at the festive board.\r\nEvery proposal being rejected, a formal notice was sent condemning\r\nthe province to be chastised with sword, and fire, and slavery, for\r\nrebellion and murder of Spaniards.[929]\r\n\r\nThe army now advanced on Zacatepec, the first town on the Tepeaca\r\nborder, where an ambuscade had been prepared in some maize fields. This\r\nwas discovered in time to prevent a surprise, but a fierce encounter\r\ntook place, wherein the horsemen did good execution, and victory was\r\nsoon obtained, with slaughter of the flying. Ojeda, who had led the\r\nTlascaltecs into the thickest of the fight, came during the pursuit to\r\nthe residence of the cacique and planted there the republican flag, in\r\ntoken of capture. These warriors had suffered severely, owing in part\r\nto the use of large lances by the enemy, but the Spaniards had only\r\na dozen wounded, beside two horses, one of which died.[930] During\r\nthe three days’ stay at this town the neighborhood was reduced, with\r\npillage and enslavement.\r\n\r\nThe next camp was formed at Acatzingo, which had been abandoned by the\r\nenemy after a short fight. These successes so discouraged the Mexican\r\ngarrisons that they abandoned the province, and the allies, on marching\r\nstraight for Tepeaca, five days later, entered it without opposition.\r\nThis now became the headquarters for the different expeditions sent\r\nout to reduce the surrounding districts;[931] and rare work they\r\nmade of it, plundering, and tearing down idols, and making captives.\r\nSalt, cotton, feather ware, and other commodities were abundant,\r\nand with their share therein the Tlascaltecs were highly delighted,\r\nbut the Spaniards obtained little gold. The rulers of the country\r\nhad fled; one of them to Mexico, to remonstrate against the retreat\r\nof the garrisons, and to demand additional aid. Finding themselves\r\nabandoned, the inhabitants sent to beg mercy of the conquerors, and\r\nbeing assured that no further harm should be done them, they returned\r\nto the city and again tendered allegiance. Several other towns were\r\ntaken, some, like Tecalco, south of Tepeaca, being evacuated, others\r\ntendering submission in advance, while still others required hard\r\nfighting to subdue.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the Tepeaca province, which was virtually accomplished\r\nin about a month,[932] produced an immediate and marked effect, not\r\nonly on the natives, but on the late refractory Spanish soldiers. The\r\nlatter were reconciled to the prosecution of the conquest on finding\r\nthe opening campaign so speedy and comparatively bloodless, and fresh\r\nconfidence was infused into the Tlascaltecs, and new allies came\r\nforward, while the prestige of Spanish arms began again to spread\r\nterror among the enemy and open a way into other provinces. This was\r\npromoted by messengers, who carried promises of release from Aztec\r\ntyranny, and pointed out the fate of rebellious and stubborn Tepeacan\r\ntowns. The Mexicans, who during the inactivity of the allies had\r\ngrown somewhat lax in their efforts to conciliate subject provinces,\r\nnow became more earnest, more free with presents and offers to remit\r\ntribute. These endeavors were greatly counteracted by their troops,\r\nhowever, whose insolence and greed drove the inhabitants to tacitly\r\nor openly favor the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of the Aztec garrisons from Tepeaca served to strengthen\r\nthose on its frontier, particularly at Quauhquechollan,[933] ten\r\nor eleven leagues south-west of the new Spanish head-quarters,\r\nwhich protected the approach to the southern pass into the valley\r\nof Mexico.[934] Its province bordered on Huexotzinco and Cholula,\r\nand skirting the snow-crowned Popocatepetl it extended for some\r\ndistance south and south-east of it. The lord,[935] who had tendered\r\nallegiance to Spain simultaneously with Montezuma, had recently sent\r\nin the assurance of his loyalty, with the explanation that fear of\r\nthe Mexicans had prevented him from doing so before. A few days later\r\ncame his messengers to ask protection against the Aztec garrisons,\r\nreinforced to the extent of some thirty thousand men,[936] who, from\r\ntheir camp within a league of the city, were plundering and committing\r\noutrages. This appeal being quite in accord with the plans of Cortés,\r\nhe at once complied by sending Olid and Ordaz, with two hundred\r\nsoldiers, thirteen horses, most of the fire-arms and cross-bows, and\r\nthirty thousand allies.[937] It was arranged with the Quauhquechollans\r\nthat they should begin the attack as soon as the Spaniards came near,\r\nand cut off communication between the city garrison and the adjoining\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nOlid marched by way of Cholula, and received _en route_ large\r\naccessions of volunteers, chiefly from the province to be aided and\r\nfrom Huexotzinco, all eager for a safe blow at the Aztecs, and for a\r\nshare of the spoils. So large, indeed, was the enrolment that some\r\nof the ever timid men of Narvaez conjured up from this a plot for\r\ntheir betrayal into the hands of the Mexicans, with whom rumor filled\r\nevery house at Quauhquechollan, making in all a larger number than at\r\nOtumba. The loyalty of the new province being wholly untried, and that\r\nof Huexotzinco but little proven, the alarm appeared not unfounded,\r\nand even the leaders became so infected as to march back to Cholula,\r\nwhence the chiefs of the suspected allies were sent under guard to\r\nCortés, with a report of the occurrence.[938] The latter examined\r\nthe prisoners, and readily surmised the cause of the trouble; but,\r\nas it would not answer to dampen native ardor for the war by leaving\r\nthem in that suspicion, he apologized for what had happened as a\r\nmisunderstanding, smoothed their ruffled feelings with presents,\r\nand encouraged their zeal. With an additional force of one hundred\r\nsoldiers and some horses he set out for Cholula to assume command in\r\nperson, shaming the men out of their fears,[939] and accepting the\r\nlarge reinforcements which were offered on the way.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he came in sight, at the end of the valley, the\r\nQuauhquechollans, who had made their preparations in advance, fell on\r\nthe garrison, securing at the same time the scouts and stragglers. The\r\nAztecs resisted valiantly, encompassed though they were by assailants\r\nwho filled the roofs and heights round the temple which formed the\r\ncitadel. An entry was effected by the Spaniards, and the natives\r\nrushed upon the warriors with such fury that scarcely one was left\r\nto tell the tale. A number of the besieged, outside the citadel,\r\nhad already fled toward the Aztec camp, whose battalions were now\r\ndescending, brilliant in feathered mail and ornaments. Entering the\r\nfurther side of the city they began to fire it. Cortés was summoned\r\nto the rescue, and hurrying onward with the cavalry he soon routed\r\ntheir disorganized masses, leaving pursuit chiefly to the allies.\r\nAt a certain pass the enemy rallied, to be dislodged within a few\r\nmoments and cut off from their camp. Exhausted by battle and flight,\r\nunder a broiling sun, they turned in disorderly scramble up the\r\nsteep mountain slope, only to find themselves checked on the summit\r\nby fleeter bands of Quauhquechollans and other allies, and obliged\r\nto make a stand. By this time they could hardly raise their hands\r\nin self-defence, and the battle became little more than a butchery,\r\nduring which scattered remnants alone managed to escape, leaving the\r\nrich garments and jewels of the dead to stay the pursuers, who now,\r\naccording to Cortés, numbered over one hundred thousand. Several\r\nSpaniards were wounded, and one horse killed.[940] The field being\r\nreaped, the victors entered the camp,[941] which was divided into\r\nthree parts, each large enough, it is said, to form a respectable town,\r\nwell appointed, with hosts of servants, supplies, and paraphernalia.\r\nLaden with spoils they returned to the city to receive a well merited\r\novation. The citizens were afterward rewarded with several privileges\r\nfor their loyal aid;[942] deservedly rewarded, for without their\r\ncoöperation the place could not have been captured without difficulty,\r\nsince it lay between two rivers[943] coursing through deep ravines,\r\nand was shielded on one side by a steep mountain range. Beside its\r\nnatural strength the city was protected by a breastwork of masonry,\r\nwhich extended toward the mountain and down into the ravines, forming\r\nhere a smooth facing of some twenty feet, and rising in other places\r\ninto a distinct wall of great height and width,[944] with a parapet.\r\nThere were four entrances,[945] wide enough for one horseman only,\r\nwith staircase approaches, and with maze-like lappings of the walls,\r\nwhich rendered it difficult to force an entrance. Along the walls\r\nlay piles of stones and rocks ready for the foe. The population was\r\nestimated at five or six thousand families, supported in part by a\r\nnumber of gardens within the city, and subject to it were three towns\r\nin the valley, containing an equal number of people.\r\n\r\nFour leagues south of Quauhquechollan lay Itzocan,[946] a well built\r\ncity, with a hundred temples, says Cortés, and a population of three\r\nor four thousand families, situated in a fertile, irrigated valley,\r\nwhich from the climatic protection afforded by the sheltering mountains\r\nincluded cotton as one of its staples, and had also some attractive\r\ngold mines. The place lay at the foot of a hill, surmounted by a\r\nstrong turreted fort, and offered a striking resemblance to Málaga,\r\nit was said. The level sides were protected by the banks of a deep\r\nriver, which here formed a semicircle, and all round the city ran a\r\nwall five feet high, well provided with towers and stone ammunition.\r\nThe cacique was an alien, appointed by Montezuma, whose niece he had\r\nmarried, and possessed strong sympathies for the lake government,\r\nwhich maintained a fine garrison. To reduce the place, so as to root\r\nout a stronghold for the dissemination of Aztec influence, was of\r\nthe first importance.\r\n\r\nThither, therefore, Cortés proceeded with his forces, including\r\nallies, who were by this time so numerous as to cover the plains and\r\nmountains, wherever the eye could reach, representing at least one\r\nhundred and twenty-five thousand men. On arriving before the city\r\nit was found occupied only by warriors, estimated at from five to\r\neight thousand, the women and children having all withdrawn. Guided\r\nby natives the army passed to a point affording a comparatively easy\r\nentrance. The surprised garrison now thought less of resistance than of\r\nsecuring their retreat across the river. It was spanned by a bridge,\r\nbut this the Spaniards destroyed as they fell upon them, and many of\r\nthe unfortunate Aztecs took to the water in their confusion, only to\r\nadd to the list of victims. The cavalry, swimming across with ease,\r\novertook and arrested a large portion of the flying till the allies\r\ncame up to aid in the slaughter.[947] Two captives were sent to offer\r\npardon to the inhabitants, on the condition of their returning and\r\nremaining loyal. Soon after the chiefs came to make arrangements,\r\nand within a few days the city had resumed its wonted appearance.\r\n\r\nCortés thought it the best policy, in this frontier town of his\r\nconquest, to make a favorable impression by extending mercy, and with\r\nthe rapid flight of his fame as an irresistible conqueror spread\r\nalso his reputation as a dispenser of justice, lenient or severe,\r\nas the case might be. A number of caciques hastened accordingly to\r\npropitiate him, during his stay in this quarter,[948] by tendering\r\nsubmission and praying to be confirmed in authority. Among them came\r\na deputation from the inhabitants of Ocopetlahuacan,[949] at the foot\r\nof Popocatepetl, who cast the blame for delay on their cacique. He\r\nhad fled with the retreating Mexicans, and they disowned him, praying\r\nthat the dignity might be conferred on his brother, who had remained,\r\nand who shared the popular desire for Spanish supremacy. After a\r\njudicious hesitation the request was granted, with the intimation\r\nthat future disobedience would be severely chastised.[950]\r\n\r\nStill more flattering overtures came from the caciques of eight towns\r\nin Cohuaixtlahuacan,[951] some forty leagues to the south, who had\r\nalready tendered allegiance on the occasion when Pilot Umbría first\r\npassed through that province in search of Zacatula’s gold mines.[952]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Itzucan, Cortés was called upon to appoint a successor\r\nto the fugitive cacique. The candidates were a bastard son of the\r\nlate native cacique, whose death was due to Montezuma, and the son\r\nof the deceased ruler’s legitimate daughter, married to the lord of\r\nQuauhquechollan. The general, being only too eager to please so loyal\r\nan ally, decided in favor of his son, on the ground of legitimacy;\r\nbut since he was not yet ten years old, the regency was intrusted to\r\nthe bastard uncle, aided by some chiefs.[953] The boy followed the\r\narmy to imbibe Spanish ideas and instruction, and received baptism\r\nnot long after, with the name of Alonso,[954] the first Christian\r\nprince in New Spain.\r\n\r\nAnother important yet troublesome expedition was to secure the road\r\nto Villa Rica, on which so many Spaniards had fallen, and which\r\nwas still dangerous. It was intrusted to two hundred men, with ten\r\nhorses, and a large force of allies.[955] The first reduction in\r\nthis quarter had been Quecholac, where pillage and enslavement formed\r\nthe retaliation for murders committed,[956] and Tecamachalco, which\r\ngave greater trouble before it fell, and yielded over two thousand\r\nslaves, besides much spoil.[957] The chastisement of these districts\r\nhad taught the easterly parts a lesson, so that more hardship than\r\nfighting was now encountered, for the march lay to a great extent\r\nthrough uninhabited tracts. It was in the region of Las Lagunas that\r\nsome captive Spaniards had been denuded and fattened, and then goaded\r\nto death, like bulls in a ring, for the amusement of the natives.\r\nThe bodies had then been devoured, a part of the flesh being jerked\r\nand distributed over the district as choice morsels, and pronounced\r\nsavory. Forty of the most guilty tormentors were secured in a yard\r\nfor execution. Informed of their fate they began to dance and sing,\r\ncommending themselves quite cheerfully to the gods as they bent their\r\nheads to the sword.[958] How blessed the righteous when they die!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [901] This appears to have taken place on the Xocotlan road,\r\n     followed by the Spaniards on first entering the country, for\r\n     in the temple of this town, says Bernal Diaz, were found the\r\n     saddles and other trophies. He estimates the treasure lost\r\n     at 40,000 pesos. _Hist. Verdad._, 108, 116-117; _Lejalde_,\r\n     _Probanza_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 425.\r\n\r\n     [902] Herrera writes, under Iuste and Morla. If correct\r\n     there were two Morlas.\r\n\r\n     [903] Herrera copies this account, but gives also another in\r\n     an earlier chapter, which leads one to suppose that Yuste\r\n     and a few companions escaped to the mountains. They either\r\n     perished of hunger or were captured at some settlement\r\n     while offering the remnant of their treasures for food.\r\n     An inscription by Yuste on a piece of bark recorded their\r\n     sufferings. ‘Por aqui passò el desdichado Iuan Iuste, con\r\n     sus desdichados compañeros, con tãta hambre, que por pocas\r\n     tortillas de mayz, diò vno vna barra de oro, que pesaua\r\n     ochocientos ducados.’ dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xiii.; dec. iii.\r\n     lib. i. cap. v. Torquemada repeats both versions, i. 530-1.\r\n     Peter Martyr and Gomara are also confused, allowing the\r\n     Yuste party in one page to fall at the pass, and on another\r\n     to turn back to Villa Rica from Tlascala. _Hist. Mex._, 165,\r\n     181-2. A misinterpretation of a vague passage by Cortés is\r\n     the cause of the mistake, into which nearly every writer\r\n     has fallen. The party carried, according to the _Cartas_,\r\n     141, 183-4, a number of agreements with the natives, and\r\n     other valuable documents, beside Cortés’ personal effects\r\n     and valuables, worth over 30,000 pesos de oro. Bernal Diaz\r\n     says three loads of gold. The inhabitants said that people\r\n     from Tezcuco and Mexico had done the deed to avenge Cacama.\r\n     But none except the natives of the district could have had\r\n     time to gather for the attack.\r\n\r\n     [904] Herrera places the number of the party at 50 or 60.\r\n     dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xv. Bernal Diaz speaks of the slaughter\r\n     in Tochtepec of 72 men and 5 women, and he leaves the\r\n     impression that they were a part of the Narvaez force which\r\n     had followed the army at their leisure. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     108. This is no doubt the party described in the text.\r\n     Yet Herrera, in cap. xvii., refers to the destruction at\r\n     Tochtepec of a force of 80 men under Captain Salcedo, who\r\n     was sent to reduce this province a few months later. This\r\n     incident, mentioned by no other original authority, may be\r\n     identical with the preceding. Had the party in question\r\n     belonged to the original force of Narvaez it would have\r\n     accompanied Yuste and Alcántara. Such not being the case,\r\n     it must have arrived after their departure. This receives\r\n     confirmation from Gomara’s statement that several small\r\n     parties, who had been attracted to New Spain by Cortés’\r\n     conquests, were killed in Tepeaca and Xalacinco. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 173. The narratives of Bernal Diaz and Cortés specify\r\n     some of these, numbering from ten to eighteen men, who\r\n     fell at Quecholac, Tepeaca, and other places. It is not\r\n     likely that so many small parties could have arrived on the\r\n     coast during the short interval of Cortés’ departure from\r\n     Cempoala and his retreat to Tlascala; nor that they would\r\n     have ventured in small numbers into a strange country,\r\n     during so unquiet a period; nor would a mere dozen have\r\n     been allowed to penetrate so far as Tepeaca ere they met\r\n     their fate. Hence they must have belonged to the large party\r\n     spoken of in the text, whose members, dead or captive, were\r\n     distributed among the different towns which had aided in\r\n     their defeat. This appears to be the only way to reconcile\r\n     the differing statements, which have so confused every\r\n     writer as to lead them into apparent blunders or into the\r\n     omission of facts. See _Robertson’s Hist. Am._, ii. 99;\r\n     _Prescott’s Mex._, ii. 409-10; _Brasseur de Bourbourg_,\r\n     _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 353-5.\r\n\r\n     [905] Bernal Diaz intimates that only two vessels remained\r\n     of Narvaez’ fleet, and one of these was now destroyed so\r\n     that the crew might be sent to Tlascala. The reinforcements\r\n     numbered four soldiers and three sailors, two of whom\r\n     suffered from swollen stomachs, and the rest from venereal\r\n     diseases. _Hist. Verdad._, 109.\r\n\r\n     [906] Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 109, mentions only four\r\n     deaths.\r\n\r\n     [907] ‘Se le pasmo la cabeça, o porque no le curaron bien,\r\n     sacãdole cascos: o por el demasiado trabajo.’ _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 162. Solis describes the progress of the\r\n     cure with a minuteness that would do credit to a medical\r\n     journal. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 212-14.\r\n\r\n     [908] The Cihuacohuatl, Tzihuacpopocatzin, Cipocatli,\r\n     and Tencuecuenotzin. The account of this tumult is given\r\n     in a memorial on the conquest by an Indian, possessed\r\n     by Torquemada. i. 509-10. Brasseur de Bourbourg assumes\r\n     Tzihuacpopocatzin and the Cihuacohuatl to be sons of Tizoc,\r\n     and the last two to be the sons of Montezuma, the last named\r\n     a bastard. Cipocatli, accepted by him as the other name for\r\n     Asupacaci, the legitimate heir of the emperor, he assumes\r\n     with Cano to have been murdered by Quauhtemotzin. _Hist.\r\n     Nat. Civ._, iv. 345. But we have seen that Cortés appears\r\n     more correct in saying that the prince fell with him during\r\n     the Noche Triste. Brasseur de Bourbourg’s assumption serves\r\n     merely to show how hasty and untrustworthy his statements\r\n     often are.\r\n\r\n     [909] Cortés assumes only two rivals, the natural sons of\r\n     Montezuma, ‘el uno diz que es loco y el otro perlático.’\r\n     _Cartas_, 153.\r\n\r\n     [910] Twenty days after Montezuma’s death. _Ixtlilxochitl_,\r\n     _Relaciones_, 413, 304.\r\n\r\n     [911] Of which Sahagun gives some account. _Hist. Conq._\r\n     (ed. 1840), 137. See also _Torquemada_, i. 511.\r\n\r\n     [912] ‘Él les hace gracia por un año de todos los tributos y\r\n     servicios que son obligados á le hacer.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     155; _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 173.\r\n\r\n     [913] _Beaumont_, _Crón. Mich._, MS., 68 etc.; _Native\r\n     Races_, ii. 107-8; v. 508 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [914] ‘Entrarian en parte de todas las rentas de las\r\n     provincias sugetas por el imperio.’ _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 304.\r\n\r\n     [915] ‘Tanto supieron decir á la señoría estos embajadores,\r\n     que casi toda ella, ... la redugeron á su voluntad y deseo.’\r\n     Old Xicotencatl being one of the most devoted. _Id._ Herrera\r\n     also assumes that this chief favors the Mexicans, but the\r\n     supposition is due to confounding the two men of this name.\r\n     dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xiv.\r\n\r\n     [916] ‘A q̄ venistes, a comernos nuestra hazienda, anda\r\n     que boluistes destroçados de Mexico, echados como viles\r\n     mugeres.’ _Id._\r\n\r\n     [917] Bernal Diaz assumes that the young chief had been\r\n     brought before the council a prisoner, to be arraigned for\r\n     his machinations. His father was so deeply incensed against\r\n     him as to decree his death, but the other chiefs were\r\n     lenient out of respect for the father; the conspirators were\r\n     arrested. _Hist. Verdad._, 109-10. A later writer states,\r\n     on doubtful authority, that the chieftain was also removed\r\n     from the command of the army; and Solis assumes that the\r\n     act of jostling him down the steps in the council-hall was\r\n     the form of degradation, which took place during a special\r\n     session, after the deliberation. He appealed to Cortés,\r\n     who caused him to be reinstated. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 220-3.\r\n     According to Camargo, the elder Xicotencatl had ceded\r\n     his place as ruler to the son, owing to his advanced age.\r\n     _Hist. Tlax._, 173-4. In such a case no imprisonment or\r\n     degradation could have been admitted; perhaps in no case,\r\n     since he merely advocated what he considered to be the\r\n     best for the country. Duran states that he was surrendered\r\n     to Cortés, who ‘le puso en prisiones, y creo que al cabo\r\n     le mandó matar,’ _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 485, a statement\r\n     which may have aided to confuse Gomara, who allows Cortés\r\n     to execute him already during his first stay at Tlascala.\r\n     On the present occasion he lets Maxixcatzin strike the\r\n     leader of the opposite faction. _Hist. Mex._, 90, 164.\r\n     His blunder and vagueness helped Herrera to confound the\r\n     two Xicotencatls, and Brasseur de Bourbourg to attribute\r\n     to father and son the same opinion. _Hist. Nat. Civ._,\r\n     iv. 365-7. This is also the view of Ixtlilxochitl. The\r\n     discussion was held in the hall or oratory of Xicotencatl,\r\n     where Cortés had planted the cross. While Maxixcatzin was\r\n     advocating the Spanish cause a cloud settled on the cross\r\n     and darkened the room. This miracle encouraged the orator,\r\n     who threw down the younger Xicotencatl and won all to his\r\n     side. The Mexican envoys were now dismissed with a refusal,\r\n     whereupon the cloud dissipated, leaving the room bright\r\n     and the cross resplendent, and attracting many believers.\r\n     _Hist. Chich._, 304-5. Sahagun allows Xicotencatl, chief\r\n     among the lords, to attack the second lord for urging the\r\n     murder of the Spaniards. _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 138.\r\n\r\n     [918] With reference to the attack on Xicotencatl in the\r\n     council-chamber, Herrera says, ‘Sin tener los Mexicanos otra\r\n     respuesta se boluieron, con relacion de lo que passaua,’ dec.\r\n     ii. lib. x. cap. xiv., a sentence which Clavigero elaborates\r\n     into a flight of the envoy on observing the agitation of\r\n     the people. ‘E’ però da credersi, che il Senato mandasse\r\n     degli Ambasciatori Tlascallesi per portar la risposta.’\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 149. Prescott and others also suppose\r\n     that they fled; but this is unlikely, since personages so\r\n     conspicuous as envoys could hardly have escaped from the\r\n     centre of the republic without the knowledge of the senate,\r\n     who had, beside, given them a guard, as well for their\r\n     honor and protection as for preventing the undue exercise of\r\n     their curiosity. Envoys enjoyed great respect among these\r\n     peoples. Camargo and Ixtlilxochitl assume more correctly\r\n     that the envoys were notified and dismissed.\r\n\r\n     [919] Tlascala sealed her enslavement, as some view it,\r\n     ignoring national interests for the sake of shameful\r\n     revenge. Behold now the punishment in her decay, and in the\r\n     odium cast on her descendants by other peoples. So says\r\n     Bustamante, in _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 140.\r\n     They have certainly dwindled away ever since Cortés began\r\n     to scatter them as colonists in different directions; but\r\n     this was the natural and inevitable consequence of the\r\n     presence of the stronger element. During Spanish dominion\r\n     they enjoyed some slight privileges, and since then no\r\n     odium has attached to them except in casual references to\r\n     the conquest by prejudiced writers.\r\n\r\n     [920] ‘En nombre de todos.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 166.\r\n     Whereat Bernal Diaz is exceedingly wroth. ‘We, the old\r\n     soldiers, stood by Cortés,’ he asserts, ‘and Gomara’s\r\n     omission to say so is intended to exalt him at our expense.’\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 110. Cortés himself intimates that the\r\n     request was general. _Cartas_, 142. But Herrera more justly\r\n     attributes it to ‘la mayor parte.’ dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xiv.\r\n\r\n     [921] ‘Si mal nos sucediere la ida [of the next campaign]\r\n     hare lo que pedis: y si bien, hareis lo que os ruego.’\r\n     Thus Cortés, by his skill and firmness, saved not only\r\n     the conquest but the lives of his men, which must have\r\n     been sacrificed in a retreat. Had they reached Villa Rica\r\n     they would not have remained there, but would have passed\r\n     on to the islands, thus abandoning the country. _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 167. Most of the points in the above speech\r\n     are to be found in the lengthy harangue prepared by this\r\n     author. Oviedo’s is weaker, and loses itself in repetitions\r\n     and crude elaborations, adorned with learned references\r\n     ill suiting a soldier addressing rude men, although not\r\n     altogether inconsistent with Cortés’ love of display.\r\n     Toward the conclusion is said: ‘If any one there is who\r\n     still insists on leaving, let him go; for rather will I\r\n     remain with a small and brave number than with many, if\r\n     composed in part of cowards and of those who respect not\r\n     their honor. Even if all fail in their duty I shall not.\r\n     We shall now know who, being of us, will drink water from\r\n     the hand, and who will kneel to drink with the face to\r\n     the ground, so that they may be bidden to depart, as God\r\n     said to Gideon.’ _Oviedo_, iii. 332-3. The test, if ever\r\n     intended, was not made, since all acquiesced. Solis, the\r\n     inveterate speech-maker, has unaccountably subsided for\r\n     this period; perhaps he is piqued at finding himself so\r\n     fully anticipated. Cortés gives a brief synopsis of what he\r\n     indicates to have been a long speech. On no account would\r\n     he commit so shameful, dangerous, and treasonable an act\r\n     as to abandon the country. _Cartas_, 142-3; _Clavigero_,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 151; _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap.\r\n     xiv.\r\n\r\n     [922] ‘Habiendo estado en esta provincia veinte dias,\r\n     aunque ni yo estaba muy sano de mis heridas, y los de mi\r\n     compañia todavía bien flacos, salí della.’ _Cortés_, 143.\r\n     Gomara follows, while Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 110,\r\n     writes that after a stay at Tlascala of 22 days Cortés\r\n     announced the determination to march on Tepeaca, which\r\n     provoked murmurs from the men of Narvaez. Preparations for\r\n     the campaign appear to have intervened before the march\r\n     began, and negotiations with the province to be assailed.\r\n     Herrera intimates that fully 50 days had passed before\r\n     negotiations were opened. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xv.\r\n\r\n     [923] ‘Significa Tepeyacac, remate, o punta de zerro,’\r\n     owing to the position of the city at the end of a mountain\r\n     range. _Id._, cap. xxi.\r\n\r\n     [924] Their father, Chichtuc, had been sole ruler, but after\r\n     his death the sons divided the province. _Id._ This author\r\n     assumes that it was merely an ally of Mexico, but there\r\n     is little doubt about its being tributary. ‘Ixcozauhqui,\r\n     le principal de ses trois chefs.’ _Brasseur de Bourbourg_,\r\n     _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 368.\r\n\r\n     [925] The suggestion of thus opening the campaign is claimed\r\n     by native historians for the Tlascaltec lords, Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     naming Xicotencatl as the originator. _Hist. Chich._, 303;\r\n     _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._, 177.\r\n\r\n     [926] And out of gratitude for Cortés’ intercession in his\r\n     behalf, as Solis claims.\r\n\r\n     [927] Half of the booty obtained in all conquered countries,\r\n     with incorporation of Cholula, Huexotzinco, and Tepeyacac.\r\n     _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._, 176. This extent of jurisdiction\r\n     is doubtful. ‘Les haria en nõbre de su Magestad escriptura\r\n     de conservarlos en sus tierras, y govierno,’ is the moderate\r\n     arrangement given in _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii.\r\n     146. When in 1655 an attempt was made to encroach on their\r\n     rights they produced the document and obtained justice.\r\n\r\n     [928] Bernal Diaz, who alone enters into details, enumerates\r\n     420 soldiers, 4000 Tlascaltecs, 17 horses, and 6 cross-bows,\r\n     without artillery or ammunition. _Hist. Verdad._, 111. But\r\n     this is hardly reliable, for a few lines before he refers\r\n     to 440 men, and there is no doubt that some ammunition,\r\n     field-pieces, and other war material must have been\r\n     obtained from Villa Rica. Herrera speaks of musketeers and\r\n     6000 allies, 50,000 more to follow. dec. ii. lib. x. cap.\r\n     xv. Gomara allows 40,000 allies to set out at once, with\r\n     provisions and carriers. _Hist. Mex._, 168. Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     mentions only 4000, and names some of the leaders. _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 305. Herrera states that a question arose as to\r\n     the prudence of trusting so small a body of soldiers with\r\n     so large a force of allies—which soon swelled to over\r\n     100,000—who might in case of disagreement overwhelm them.\r\n     A council was held, which decided that the loyalty of the\r\n     Tlascaltecs had been sufficiently tried, and that a small\r\n     number of allies would be of no service. ubi sup., cap. xiv.\r\n\r\n     [929] Cortés’ first messengers returned with two Mexicans,\r\n     who brought the contemptuous reply. They were given presents,\r\n     and told to summon the native chiefs to a parley. On their\r\n     return with a threatening answer ‘fue acordado, ... por\r\n     ante Escriuano ... que se diessen por esclauos à todos los\r\n     aliados de Mexico, que huviessen muerto Españoles.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 112. ‘Respondieron que si mataron\r\n     Españoles fue con justa razon, pues en tiempo de guerra\r\n     quisieron passar por su tierra por fuerça, y sin demandar\r\n     licencia.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 168.\r\n\r\n     [930] ‘Tuuierõ los Indios amigos buena cena aquella noche\r\n     de piernas, y braços, porque sin los assadores de palo,\r\n     que eran infinitos, huuo cincuenta mil ollas de carne\r\n     humana.’ The Spaniards suffered from want of water and food.\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xv. Rather a strong story.\r\n     The Spaniards could not well suffer from hunger in the midst\r\n     of maize fields, in harvest time. Oviedo takes occasion\r\n     to dwell on the common practice of devouring the slain on\r\n     the battle-field, thus saving the trouble of burial. iii.\r\n     334. ‘Mi pare una favola,’ is Clavigero’s comment. _Storia\r\n     Mess._, iii. 152. See _Native Races_.\r\n\r\n     [931] ‘Padeciendo siempre de agua, y comida.’ _Herrera_,\r\n     ubi sup. But this could hardly be the case in so rich a\r\n     province, at this time.\r\n\r\n     [932] ‘En obra de veinte dias hobe pacíficas muchas villas\r\n     y poblaciones á ella sujetas ... sin que en toda la dicha\r\n     guerra me matasen ni hiriesen ni un español.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 143. ‘En obra de quarenta dias tuvimos aquellos\r\n     pueblos pacificos,’ but with great hardship, ‘porque de\r\n     sangre, y polvo que estaua quajado en las entrañas, no\r\n     echauamos otra cosa del cuerpo, y por la boca,’ etc. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 112-13.\r\n\r\n     [933] The name of a beautiful bird, now San Martin de\r\n     Huaquechula. This town was known to the Spaniards under\r\n     the name of Guacachula.\r\n\r\n     [934] ‘Á la entrada de un puerto que se pasa para entrar á\r\n     la provincia de Méjico por allí.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 145.\r\n     After the conquest it was moved to a more open site, three\r\n     leagues south. _Torquemada_, i. 316.\r\n\r\n     [935] Calcozametl. _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 372.\r\n\r\n     [936] Herrera reduces Cortés’ figure to 20,000.\r\n\r\n     [937] Bernal Diaz names Olid alone for the command, and\r\n     Gomara adds Ordaz and Andrés de Tapia, while Herrera\r\n     substitutes Ordaz and Ávila. The latter is probably wrong\r\n     in giving them 300 soldiers, and Peter Martyr errs, through\r\n     his printer, perhaps, in allowing only 3000 allies.\r\n\r\n     [938] Cortés writes that this occurred in a town of\r\n     Huexotzinco province, and that here the Spaniards were\r\n     alarmed by the report of collusion between the Huexotzincas,\r\n     the Quauhquechollans, and the Aztecs. The leaders described\r\n     the expedition as difficult. _Cartas_, 146. Gomara follows,\r\n     naming the captain who brought the chiefs captive to Cortés.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 169. Bernal Diaz points out very plausibly\r\n     that Huexotzinco lay wholly out of the way; and, ignoring\r\n     the accession of volunteers, he assumes that the report of\r\n     a vast gathering of Mexican troops round Quauhquechollan\r\n     was the cause for alarm, among the Narvaez party only. Olid\r\n     appealed to their honor, and did all he could to encourage\r\n     them, but failed. _Hist. Verdad._, 112-13. Clavigero\r\n     believes, on the other hand, that Olid caught the alarm as\r\n     readily as the rest. _Storia Mess._, iii. 154. The joining\r\n     of Huexotzincas may have led to the belief that the march\r\n     lay through their territory.\r\n\r\n     [939] Bernal Diaz states that Cortés did not go, but sent\r\n     Olid a sharp letter, which roused him to proceed with the\r\n     expedition. But our chronicler was sick with fever all this\r\n     time, and has evidently not been well informed.

Returning\r\n     to Tepeaca he was received with great honor, and joined in\r\n     laughing at the alarm which had caused the army to turn back\r\n     at Cholula.

Chimalpain identifies\r\n     it with Huaxtéca, which is decidedly out of the way, _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, ii. 12, while Orozco y Berra stamps ‘en verdad\r\n     errónea’ the suggestion of Lorenzana that it is Oajaca; but\r\n     modern maps do place it in Oajaca, very slightly modified\r\n     in spelling.\r\n\r\n     [952] They had always been loyal, they said, although\r\n     deterred by fear of Mexico from sooner proclaiming it; the\r\n     four remaining pueblos of the province would soon send in\r\n     their allegiance. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 152-3.\r\n\r\n     [953] The construction of sentences in _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     152, and the complex relationship, have misled nearly every\r\n     one who notices this incident—as, _Gomara_, _Hist.

V. de Tapia, in his testimony against Cortés,\r\n     states that about 6000 prisoners were sent to him from\r\n     these districts by Olid, all of whom had surrendered\r\n     without resistance, and that he ordered the men, 2000 in\r\n     number, to be executed, the women and children being sold\r\n     or distributed. _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i. 59-60.\r\n\r\n     [958] ‘Boluierõ a Tepeaca, y auiendo estado treynta dias en\r\n     esta jornada hallaron a Hernando Cortes, que era buelto de\r\n     Guacachula.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xvii. These\r\n     successes are said to have been dimmed by a severe defeat\r\n     at Tochtepec, on Rio Papaloapan, whither Salcedo had been\r\n     sent with 80 men. It was the _entrepôt_ for trade in this\r\n     region, and was held by a strong Aztec garrison, aided by\r\n     native warriors with Chinantec pikes. Owing partly to the\r\n     efficient use of this weapon, and partly to the carelessness\r\n     of Salcedo, the troops were surprised and slaughtered to a\r\n     man, after selling their lives as dearly as possible. The\r\n     disaster being a blow also to Spanish prestige which it\r\n     would never do to overlook, Ordaz and Ávila were sent not\r\n     long after with a larger force, some horses, and 20,000\r\n     allies, to exact retaliation in death, captivity, and rich\r\n     spoil. The victors came back with ample plunder. _Herrera_,\r\n     ubi sup.

It was easy\r\nwork overcoming the divided Aztec forces, which combined had proved\r\nso formidable. And there was little trouble now from factions. None\r\nadvocated a station by the sea-side, with ships ready for flight; none\r\nthought of abandoning New Spain for Cuba. The simple presence of the\r\ngeneral was as the shield of Abas, which performed so many marvels,\r\nand the mere sight of which could on the instant stay a revolt or\r\nreduce a province to submission.\r\n\r\nThe successes of the Spaniards were rapidly enlarging the fame and\r\ninfluence of their leader, bringing among other fruits, as we have\r\nseen, alliances and reinforcements, not alone from native sources,\r\nbut from Spanish. The first accession of the latter was thirteen\r\nsoldiers and two horses, brought in a small vessel under the hidalgo,\r\nPedro Barba, formerly commandant at Habana. Commandant Rangel at\r\nVilla Rica had received instructions to secure any vessel that might\r\narrive, both with a view to obtain recruits, and to prevent news from\r\ntravelling to Cuba of the defeat of Narvaez, or other incidents. As\r\nthe vessel entered the roadstead he accordingly approached it in a well\r\nmanned boat, with hidden arms. “How fares Narvaez?” was Barba’s first\r\ninquiry. “Exceedingly well,” replied Rangel. “He is prosperous and\r\nrich, while Cortés is a fugitive, with a score of miserable followers\r\nat the most; or he even may be dead.” “All the better,” rejoined\r\nBarba; “for I bear letters from the most magnificent Velazquez, with\r\ninstructions to secure the traitor, if he be alive, and send him at\r\nonce to Cuba, whence he shall go to Spain, as commanded by our most\r\nillustrious Bishop Fonseca.” As a matter of course, Señor Barba will\r\naccept the proffered hospitality; he will go ashore and deliver his\r\nmessage to Narvaez in person. And he will catch this slippery fox\r\nfrom Estremadura, and carry him hence to be hanged; he will carry\r\nhim to his worshipful master Velazquez to be hanged. So entering the\r\nboat he is conveyed away, but only, alas! to be declared a prisoner;\r\nonly, alas! to learn that though damned, Cortés is not dead, and is\r\nby no means likely at once to meet strangulation at the hand either\r\nof Barba, Narvaez, or Velazquez. Meanwhile other visitors in other\r\nboats proceed to secure the crew. The vessel is dismantled; and\r\nsince Cortés is the king, and not Narvaez, the so lately fierce and\r\nloyal Barba, nothing loath, declares for Cortés. Indeed, Barba was\r\nby no means unfriendly to the general, as proven by his attitude at\r\nHabana two years before. Any such reinforcement was gladly welcomed\r\nat Tepeaca, and Cortés sought to insure Barba’s loyalty by making him\r\ncaptain of archers.[959] A week later arrived another small vessel,\r\nunder the hidalgo Rodrigo Morejon de Lobera, with eight soldiers, a\r\nmare, a quantity of crossbow material, and a cargo of provisions. It\r\nwas secured in the same manner, and the soldiers and sailors proceeded\r\nto join the army. Thus Cortés draws them in, friend and foe alike\r\nbeing his fish, if once they enter his net.\r\n\r\nMore substantial reinforcements were in store, however. Governor\r\nGaray, of Jamaica, had in no manner been discouraged by the failure\r\nof his last expedition to Pánuco, and the rumors of his rival’s\r\nsuccess in New Spain fired him to renewed efforts, the more so since\r\nhe possessed the royal grant, the vessels, and the men, with ample\r\nmeans to sustain them. In the spring of 1520 he had despatched three\r\nvessels, with about one hundred and fifty soldiers and sailors, a few\r\nhorses, and some artillery, under the former commander, Pineda.[960]\r\nAscending the Pánuco the expedition came to a town,[961] and met\r\nwith good reception, but the natives soon tired of giving their\r\nsubstance to strangers, who may beside have been guilty of excesses,\r\nand they made hostile demonstrations. Pineda showed a bold front, and\r\nproceeded to attack the town, but was surprised and killed, together\r\nwith a number of soldiers and the horses.[962] The rest escaped as\r\nbest they could in two of the vessels, pursued by a fleet of canoes.\r\nOne of the caravels was wrecked not far above Villa Rica, whereupon\r\na portion of the men resolved to proceed by land rather than suffer\r\nstarvation on board, for in the hurry of the flight the lockers had\r\nreceived no attention. Both the sea and land parties arrived at the\r\nSpanish port, where every care was given them.[963] Thence they were\r\nforwarded to Tepeaca, where their cadaverous complexion and swollen\r\nbodies procured for them the nickname of ‘panzaverdetes,’ or green\r\npaunches. Hardship and bad food had carried a number past relief,\r\nand even in Tepeaca several died, including Camargo, as Bernal Diaz\r\nbelieves.\r\n\r\nA month later, after the Quauhquechollan expedition, another vessel\r\narrived with about fifty soldiers,[964] under Miguel Diaz de Auz, an\r\nAragonian cavalier. He had been sent to reinforce Pineda, but after\r\nremaining at Rio Pánuco for a month, without seeing even a native,\r\nhe had come down to search for the fleet. The fame of Cortés and the\r\npromise of rich spoils induced him to follow the preceding party,\r\nin contradistinction to which his stout and lusty recruits were\r\ndubbed the ‘strong-backs.’[965] Hearing that two other vessels had\r\nbeen fitted out to follow the Pánuco expeditions, and were probably\r\nnow cruising along the coast, Cortés ordered a crew to be sent in\r\npursuit, with the sole desire, as he expressed it, to save them from\r\nthe fate which had so nearly overtaken Camargo. One was never heard\r\nof, and the other, the largest, entered the port before the searching\r\nvessel had left, it seems, bringing about one hundred and twenty\r\nmen and sixteen horses. Camargo was induced to remonstrate with the\r\ncaptain against proceeding to Pánuco, since the result could only be\r\ndisastrous, the native lord having, beside, tendered allegiance to\r\nCortés in Montezuma’s time.[966] But the captain would not listen to\r\nhim. To the joy of Cortés, however, a storm arose, which obliged this\r\ncaptain to slip his anchor and put to sea; obliged him to take refuge\r\nin San Juan de Ulua harbor, where he found his vessel so unsafe as to\r\nrequire her to be stranded, whereupon the forces and armaments were\r\nlanded.[967] Cortés at once sent a sympathizing message, offering\r\nthe captain every assistance, but never for a moment intending to\r\ngive him any. He even tendered other vessels for his voyage—so he\r\ntells the emperor.[968] But there is no doubt that the tender was\r\nillusive, and that he did all in his power, with bribery, promises,\r\nand even force, to secure the men and armament, and at the same time\r\nto weaken his rivals by their loss. According to some accounts he\r\ncaused their vessels to be sunk to prevent departure,[969] an act\r\nwhich Oviedo declares a fair war measure, particularly on the part\r\nof Cortés, who greatly needed reinforcements. Men destined for so\r\ncomparatively unattractive a region as Pánuco must have been pleased\r\nby the prospect of ready spoils and Mexican treasures soon to fall\r\ninto their hands under so able and successful a leader as Cortés. They\r\nwere therefore readily induced to join him, the captains alone, as in\r\nthe last instance, interposing objections for a while. These several\r\naccessions amounted, according to the testimony of Cortés, to about\r\ntwo hundred men and some twenty horses,[970] together with a large\r\nquantity of small-arms, artillery, and ammunition. Thus again and\r\nagain was the shrewd and lucky Cortés aided by the very means which\r\nhis great enemies and rivals had sent to be used against him; aided to\r\nreap the advantages they had planned and plotted to secure. And all\r\nthe while he was pitting the antagonisms of native foes one against\r\nanother, employing them also to assist him in securing the grand\r\nprize. Greatness is but another name for good fortune. Circumstances\r\ncertainly did as much for Cortés in promoting success as Spanish arms\r\nand superior civilization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCivilization! What fools we are, pluming ourselves in its radiance,\r\nthe radiance of ghastly electrical lights, adopted instead of the\r\nglorious sun of nature. For is not the unartificial nature, and nature\r\nGod, while artifice is rather of the devil? And yet we persist in\r\nglorifying artifice and calling it deity. The human sacrifice of the\r\nAztecs was a horrible rite, but in the hands of the Spaniards is not\r\nChristianity a bloody mistress? And does not European civilization\r\nconstantly demand the sacrifice of millions of lives, if not for\r\nthe propitiation of gods, then to avenge an insult, to preserve the\r\nintegrity of a nation, or to gratify the spleen of rulers? At hand even\r\nnow, coming to the assistance of the magnificent Cortés, civilization’s\r\npride and pet for the moment, is another ally of civilization, more\r\nterrible than horses, blood-hounds, gunpowder, or steel. At the\r\ntime of Narvaez’ departure for Cuba, small-pox was raging there so\r\nseverely that it offered a reason for preventing the governor from\r\nleaving with the expedition. A pioneer vessel of the fleet sowed\r\nthe malady at Cozumel, whence it entered the continent. Before it\r\nspread far in this direction Cempoala was infected by a negro slave\r\nof Narvaez.[971] The Spaniards knew little about its treatment, and\r\nthat little they sought to impart, not for their own safety, since\r\nthose that were left of them were considered almost proof against the\r\nmalady, but for the sake of the allies. Their advice did not avail\r\nmuch, however, for the natives were too devoted to their panacea,\r\nthe hot and cold bath, which only intensified the evil. The terrible\r\nforce of the first attacks of epidemics and endemics is well known,\r\nand it has been advocated with apparent truth that the diseases of\r\na strong people fall with particular force on weaker races. After\r\ndesolating the coast region for some time, the small-pox crossed\r\nthe plateau border during the summer, and in September[972] it broke\r\nout round the lakes, on its way to the western sea, smiting high and\r\nlow, rich and poor. For sixty days, according to native records, the\r\n_hueyzahuatl_, or great pest, raged here with such virulence as to\r\nfix itself a central point in their chronology. In most districts,\r\nsays Motolinia, over half the population died, leaving towns almost\r\ndeserted, and in others the mortality was appalling. Those who\r\nrecovered presented an appearance that made their neighbors flee\r\nfrom them, until they became accustomed to the sight. Learning how\r\ncontagious was the disease, and terrified by the number of deaths,\r\nthe inhabitants left the bodies to putrefy, thus aiding to extend the\r\npest. In some cases the authorities ordered the houses to be pulled\r\ndown over the dead, so as to check the contagion. Not the least of\r\nthe evil was a famine, which resulted from a lack of harvesters.[973]\r\n\r\nAmong the first victims at the capital were King Totoquihuatzin, of\r\nTlacopan, and Cuitlahuatzin, the successor of Montezuma. The latter\r\nhad ruled barely three months,[974] but sufficiently long to prove\r\nhimself a most able leader of his people in their struggle for liberty,\r\nfor he was brave, full of devices, and energetic, yet prudent; a\r\nman who, not content with securing the expulsion of invaders, had\r\nsought to strengthen his position with alliances and by attracting\r\nthe subject provinces through gifts, remissions, and promises. If he\r\ndid not succeed so well as he had hoped, the fault must be ascribed\r\nto the reputation of the previous government and to dereliction of\r\nduty among his officers.\r\n\r\nAs a monarch he would not have fallen far short of the native ideal,\r\nfor as a general he had distinguished himself; and, the brother of\r\nMontezuma, he had in his court imbibed the dignity and majestic manner\r\nborn of constant adulation from subservient nobles and plebeians.\r\nCrafty and unscrupulous, he appears not to have hesitated at crime and\r\nbreach of faith to secure his aims for personal and state advancement.\r\nThe flourishing condition of his own province indicated a not unwise\r\nadministrator; and the beauty of Iztapalapan, its magnificent palaces,\r\nand exquisite gardens filled with choice plants from different regions,\r\npointed to a ruler of cultivated taste.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Mexico lost in him one of the most promising\r\nof sovereigns, and perhaps the only leader capable of giving her\r\na longer lease of freedom in face of the irresistible onslaught of\r\nforeigners.[975] Thus bravely worked the small-pox for Cortés and\r\nthe superior civilization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe strongest candidate for the Mexican throne was now the high-priest\r\nQuauhtemotzin,[976] a young man of about twenty-three[977] years,\r\nrather handsome, of fairer complexion than the average of his race,\r\ngrave and dignified, as befitted a prince, and ‘quite a gentleman for\r\nan Indian.’ He is said to have been the son of Montezuma’s sister by\r\nItzquauhtzin, lord of Tlatelulco, the twin town or suburb of Mexico,\r\nwho had been fellow-prisoner of the late emperor, and sharer in his\r\nfate.[978] The brothers and descendants of Montezuma had been pretty\r\nwell removed by death, or through the machinations of Cuitlahuatzin;\r\nbut if nearer legitimate claimants existed, Quauhtemotzin had eclipsed\r\nthem all in experience, influence, and fame, as a brave and able\r\nleader. As the chief companion of his predecessor, and one who even\r\nbefore the appearance of the latter had led the uprising against\r\nthe Spaniards, he had become identified as a true patriot, keeping\r\nhimself at the head of the dominant party which began and continued\r\nthe struggle for freedom. In order further to secure his influence\r\nhe had taken to wife the only legitimate daughter of Montezuma,\r\nPrincess Tecuichpo, or Isabel; and although the marriage was merely\r\nnominal, she being but a child, yet the alliance served the intended\r\naim.[979] The Tepanecs at the same time elected as successor to their\r\nking, his son Tetlepanquetzaltzin,[980] whose coronation took place\r\nat the same time as that of Quauhtemotzin, hallowed by the blood of\r\ncaptive enemies, including no doubt some Spaniards. Cohuanacoch had\r\nmeanwhile been chosen at Tezcuco in lieu of the disowned protégé\r\nwhom Cortés had foisted upon them. By this trio were taken up the\r\nplans of Cuitlahuatzin for the deliverance of the country from her\r\ninvaders, and especially were their efforts directed toward securing\r\nthe loyalty of provinces and allies which had been stirred by the\r\nalarming progress of Spanish arms in Tepeaca.\r\n\r\nA loss to the Spaniards through the epidemic, which outweighed many\r\na gain, was the death of Maxixcatzin, to whose devoted friendship\r\nthey chiefly owed their escape from the recent crises;[981] for he\r\nit was who took the lead in offering the Tlascaltec alliance and\r\nin overthrowing the inimical plans of the younger Xicotencatl in\r\nfavor of the Aztecs. When the sad news came, Cortés felt as if he\r\nhad lost a father, says Bernal Diaz, and mourning robes were donned\r\nby quite a number of the captains and men. In this they felt the\r\nmore justified, since the chief, on finding himself stricken by the\r\ndread disease, had expressed a wish to become a Christian, and with\r\nthe name of Lorenzo had received baptism at the hands of Olmedo, who\r\njoyfully hastened to Tlascala to perform so welcome a service for\r\nthe Spaniards’ champion. He died exhorting his family and friends to\r\nobey Cortés and his brethren, the destined rulers of the land, and\r\nto accept their god, who had given victory over the idols.[982] It\r\nwas fortunate that he did not die before Spanish prestige had been\r\nreëstablished by the Tepeaca campaign; for his friendship sufficed\r\nto confirm the allies in their adhesion, to gain for the Spaniards\r\nfurther coöperation, and to obtain for them a firm footing in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe allied forces had become so numerous by the time Itzucan fell\r\nthat they were absolutely unmanageable, and on returning from this\r\nplace to Tepeaca Cortés dismissed them with friendly words to their\r\nhomes, retaining only the tried Tlascaltecs, who had become efficient\r\nin the European style of warfare under the Spanish discipline and\r\ntactics.[983]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore the Quauhquechollan expedition summoned him away, Cortés\r\nhad begun a report to the emperor on the condition of affairs. On\r\nreturning, he completed this his second and perhaps most interesting\r\nletter, dated at Segura de la Frontera, or Tepeaca, October 30, 1520,\r\nwherein are related the occurrences since the despatch of the first\r\nletter in the middle of July, a year before. “I write your Majesty,”\r\nit states, “although poorly told, the truth of all that has happened\r\nin these parts, and that which your Majesty has most need of knowing.\r\nWith the aid of God the conquest is progressing in this new country,\r\nwhich from its similarity to Spain, in fertility, extent, temperature,\r\nand many other things, I have called La Nueva España del Mar Océano.”\r\nThen he proceeds to humbly beg his majesty to confirm this name. In\r\na brief supplementary letter he asks the emperor to send a person of\r\nconfidence to investigate and prove the truth of his statements.[984]\r\n\r\nThe council also wrote a letter to the emperor, speaking hopefully\r\nof the conquest, which already “extended, over one hundred and\r\nfifty leagues of the coast, from Rio Grande de Tabasco to Rio de\r\nPánuco,”[985] while the remainder of the interior was on the sure\r\nway to reduction, under the able leadership of Cortés, whose valor\r\nand energy they praised.\r\n\r\nThey prayed that he, the beloved of all the troops, might be confirmed\r\nin the office of captain-general, as the only man whose genius and\r\nexperience could be relied on to carry out and maintain the conquest.\r\nThe natives being docile and ready to receive conversion, friars\r\nshould be sent to secure this harvest for the church, and also to\r\nadminister to the spiritual wants of the Spaniards. Colonists were\r\nneeded; also horses, and other live-stock—the latter to be paid for\r\nat a future time—in order to secure the country and develop its wealth.\r\n\r\nWith these letters went one from the army, which, recounting but\r\nbriefly the leading incidents of the campaigns, had for its main\r\nobject to decry Narvaez and Velazquez as the sole cause of all the\r\ndisasters that had occurred in the country, and to praise Cortés as\r\na noble, loyal, and able man, by whom alone the conquest could be\r\nachieved.[986] These and other letters were intrusted to Alonso de\r\nMendoza, a townsman of Cortés, together with thirty thousand pesos,\r\nin fifths and presents, and a number of commissions from different\r\nmembers of the expedition. A well appointed vessel was assigned for\r\nthe voyage, and three other vessels were despatched for Española,\r\nthere to enlist recruits and to buy horses, arms and ammunition,\r\ncattle, clothing, and other requirements, and four strong vessels to\r\nmaintain traffic with the Antilles. Letters were sent to Licenciado\r\nRodrigo de Figueroa and other royal officers on the Island, inclosing\r\nduplicates of those forwarded to Spain; and a number of specimens of\r\nthe jewels, manufactures, and natural resources of the country, were\r\ntransmitted as presents and as samples to allure recruits. The letters\r\nand the ample funds for the enlistment and purchases were intrusted to\r\nContador Ávila and another officer,[987] with instructions to use every\r\neffort to confirm the audiencia officials in their good opinion of\r\nCortés, so that they might plead his cause in Spain. The ill-treatment\r\nof Aillon by Velazquez and Narvaez had already impelled them to do\r\nthis, as we have seen. Their advice was to be asked regarding the\r\nenslavement of rebels and other measures, and their authority and aid\r\nsought for obtaining men and stores.[988] Another vessel was sent\r\nunder Solis[989] to Jamaica to buy horses and war material. Bernal\r\nDiaz does not fail to point out the evidence in the large remittance\r\nfor Spain and the Antilles of treasures secretly taken from Mexico\r\nby Cortés and his clique, and accuses him of having appropriated\r\nalso the share for Villa Rica, claimed to have been captured by the\r\nIndians during its transmission from Tlascala.[990]\r\n\r\nNo sooner were these preparations announced than Duero and a number\r\nof others of the Narvaez party claimed a fulfilment of the promise\r\nregarding their departure. The success of the Spanish arms and the\r\nallurement of spoils had reconciled most of the lately disaffected,\r\nso that those who now demanded to return were only a few of the more\r\nwealthy. The services of these could be readily dispensed with, now\r\nthat such large reinforcements had been received, and the display of\r\ntheir accumulations at home might inspire fresh recruits. Therefore\r\nCortés gave his consent, with abundant promises that as soon as the\r\nconquest was fully accomplished, gold and other rewards would flow\r\non those who supported his cause either in the Islands or in Spain.\r\nLeaders like Duero and Bermudez were the chief recipients of such\r\noffers; and offers alone they remained in most instances, for Cortés\r\nwas not the man to reward desertion. Duero and others evidently\r\nexpected nothing more, since they were soon after found arrayed on the\r\nside of Velazquez. When some among the Cortés party raised objections\r\nto this diminution of the force, they were quieted with the declaration\r\nthat the army was better rid of unwilling and inefficient soldiers,\r\nwhose presence served only to discourage others.[991]\r\n\r\nThe vessel for Spain and two of those for the Islands were wrecked\r\non the coast; and one consequence was that Mendoza’s departure was\r\ndelayed till the 5th of March. He took with him a supplementary letter\r\nfor the emperor, relating the progress so far made for the recovery of\r\nMexico. By this time Ordaz was, according to Bernal Diaz, commissioned\r\nto join him and plead the cause of Cortés before the emperor, and at\r\nthe same time to receive the reward for his many achievements, one\r\nof which was the ascent of the volcano. Several of the Narvaez party\r\nappear to have left by the same vessel.[992]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn course of the late campaign the advantages of the town of Tepeaca\r\nfor permanent occupation had become apparent, chiefly as a point of\r\nobservation for watching over the new conquest. It was well situated\r\nfor protecting the road to Villa Rica,[993] and for communicating\r\nwith Cholula and Tlascala, each capital eight or nine leagues\r\ndistant, and it lay in the midst of a fertile maize country, which\r\noffered ample subsistence for a garrison. Although the punishment at\r\nfirst inflicted, by sacking and enslaving, had been severe, yet the\r\ntreatment of the inhabitants became afterward so considerate that\r\nthey themselves prayed for a continuance of Spanish protection.[994]\r\nEvery circumstance, therefore, demanding a settlement, it was decided\r\nin council to found a villa in this same town, with the appropriate\r\nname of Segura de la Frontera, intended, as it was, to secure the\r\nfrontier against the Mexicans. Pedro de Ircio was made alcalde, with\r\nFrancisco de Orozco and others as regidores.[995]\r\n\r\nThe campaign being practically concluded, a division was ordered to\r\nbe made of the spoils not hitherto distributed, including slaves,\r\nwhich had now become a prominent feature thereof, and were intended\r\nfor personal and plantation service, as already practised in the\r\nAntilles. The pretence was to enslave only the inhabitants of districts\r\nconcerned in the murder of Spaniards, but the distinction was not\r\nvery strictly observed, and rebellious tribes and those addicted\r\nto cannibalism and other vicious practices were included.[996] The\r\nSpaniards, as a rule, kept only the women and the children, the men\r\nbeing transferred to the allies for their share, “because they were\r\ndifficult to watch,” says Bernal Diaz, “and because their services\r\nwere not needed while we had the Tlascaltecs with us.”[997]\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were ordered to bring in all their captives, which from\r\nthe first had been branded for recognition with a ‘G,’ signifying\r\n_guerra_, war.[998] When the day for distribution came, it was found\r\nthat the leaders and favored men had already secured their share by\r\nappropriating the prettiest and choicest slaves. They had probably\r\nbeen priced by the officials, and the leaders, being entitled to\r\nlarger shares, had secured the best articles. At this there was a\r\nconsiderable uproar, increased by the outcry against the fifth set\r\napart for Cortés, after deducting the royal fifth.[999] How the matter\r\nwas settled is not clear, except that the general had recourse to the\r\nsoothing eloquence he knew so well how to apply, promising that for\r\nthe future he would conform to the general desire, which appeared\r\nto be in favor of offering the slaves at auction, so as to arrive\r\nat their proper value, and to give all members of the expedition an\r\nequal chance in securing the more desirable.[1000]\r\n\r\nOne of the last expeditions fitted out at Segura was for the reduction\r\nof the northern route to Villa Rica, by which the Spaniards had first\r\nentered the plateau, and for the punishment of those concerned in\r\nthe murder of Alcántara and other Spaniards.[1001] It set out in the\r\nbeginning of December, under Sandoval, with two hundred infantry,\r\ntwenty horses, and the usual complement of allies, and entered\r\nXocotlan valley, which readily submitted, with the exception of the\r\nmain town, named Castilblanco during the first entry into the country.\r\nThe cacique, who had then already shown himself unfriendly, rejected\r\nevery proposition, with the threat that he would make a feast on the\r\ncommander and his followers, as he had on the former party. There\r\nbeing no alternative, the cavalry charged the large force which had\r\ntaken up position near a ravine, on the outskirts of the city, with\r\na view to defend the entrance. Under cover of the musketeers and\r\narchers, who from one side of the ravine did considerable harm to\r\nthe enemy, the charge succeeded, though four riders and nine horses\r\nwere wounded, one of the latter dying. The enemy thrown into disorder\r\nfled to join the remaining garrison, which occupied the temples on\r\nthe plaza. With the aid of the infantry and allies the stronghold\r\nspeedily fell, and a number of prisoners were secured.[1002]\r\n\r\nProceeding northward along the mountain border of the plateau Sandoval\r\nadded a considerable extent of country to his conquest, meeting serious\r\nopposition only at Jalancingo, where the Aztec garrison, ever since\r\nthe beginning of the Tepeaca campaign, had been employed in fortifying\r\nthe place, and either considered themselves secure or feared that\r\na surrender would procure no better terms, for them, at least. They\r\nwere disconcerted by being attacked on different sides, under native\r\nguidance, and after a brief resistance took to flight, during which\r\na number of them were captured, the Spaniards losing three horses,\r\nand having eight men severely injured, Sandoval receiving an arrow\r\nwound. In a temple were found relics of slaughtered Spaniards, in\r\nthe shape of dresses, arms, and saddles.[1003] A few days later the\r\nexpedition set out to rejoin the army, with a large amount of spoils\r\nand a train of captives. The chiefs were pardoned by Cortés, with\r\npolitic regard for the future, and enjoined to furnish their quota\r\nof supplies at Segura.[1004]\r\n\r\nThe head-quarters had meanwhile been removed to Tlascala, preparatory\r\nto a march on Mexico, and Segura was now in charge of the alcalde,\r\nPedro de Ircio, lately lieutenant of Sandoval at Villa Rica, assisted\r\nby the regidor, Francisco de Orozco, and sixty men, including the\r\ninvalids and the disabled.[1005] Cortés had left it in the middle\r\nof December,[1006] taking with the cavalry the route through\r\nCholula,[1007] to settle the question of succession to a number of\r\ncacique offices vacated during the epidemic. These appeals were made to\r\nhim not only as the representative of the Spanish monarch to whom the\r\npeople had sworn obedience, but as an acknowledgment of his influence\r\nover the native mind. His treatment of the conquered and his equitable\r\ndecisions of disputes had made him the umpire and king-maker whom\r\nnot only allies, but half-reconciled tribes were willing to heed, in\r\nprivate and public affairs. Having made the appointments, and formed\r\nfavorable arrangements for himself, he rejoined the army. The march to\r\nTlascala was one befitting the return of conquering heroes. Triumphal\r\narches covered the roads, and processions came to chant the praises\r\nof the victors, and recount the successes achieved by the Tlascaltec\r\nallies, as shown by spoils and banners from different provinces and\r\ncities, and by long files of captives. On nearing the republican\r\ncapital the whole population came forth to join in the ovation, and\r\nat the plaza an orator stepped forward to greet Cortés in a glowing\r\npanegyric, wherein he reviewed his progress as conqueror and avenger.\r\nIn reply Cortés alluded feelingly to the brotherhood between the two\r\nraces, now cemented by blood and victories, and to the common loss\r\nsustained in the death of the wise and noble Maxixcatzin. These words,\r\nadded to the evidence of sorrow in the mourning array of their dress\r\nand arms, left a most favorable impression on the minds of the brave\r\nallies.\r\n\r\nHe was again called as representative of his king to appoint as\r\nsuccessor to Maxixcatzin his eldest legitimate son, a boy of twelve\r\nyears, against whom a claimant had arisen.[1008] This done, Cortés\r\ndubbed him a knight, according to Castilian usage, in recognition\r\nof the services of his father, causing him also to be baptized, with\r\nthe name of Juan, Maxixcatzin becoming the family name.[1009] Taking\r\nadvantage of the occasion and of his own popularity, the general sought\r\nto inspire a more general feeling in favor of his religion, but the\r\neffort met with little encouragement, and he wisely refrained from\r\npressing so dangerous a subject. According to Bernal Diaz, the elder\r\nXicotencatl was among the limited number of saved souls, and received\r\nthe name of Vicente.[1010] The native records, as given by Camargo and\r\nTorquemada, and adopted by most writers, assume that the four chiefs\r\nwere all baptized at this time, if not earlier; but they are neither\r\nclear nor consistent, and are evidently impelled by a desire to redeem\r\nthe native leaders from the charge of idolatry. Cortés, Herrera,\r\nDiaz, and other chroniclers would not have failed to record so large\r\nand prominent a conquest for the church, particularly since the two\r\nlatter do mention the exceptional converts.[1011] Cortés also refers\r\nto a conversion in the person of Tecocoltzin, a younger brother of\r\nKing Cacama, and the future head of Tezcuco, who is named Fernando;\r\nbut he does so in a manner which indicates that the conversion was\r\nexceptional.[1012] His baptism took place probably on the same day\r\nas that of young Maxixcatzin and old Xicotencatl, the occasion being\r\ncelebrated with banquets and dances, with illumination, sports, and\r\nexchange of presents, the Spaniards adding horse-races and other\r\ninteresting proceedings for the gratification of the natives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [959] ‘Con este ... vino vn Francisco Lopez, vezino,\r\n     y Regidor que fue de Guatimala.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 113. Vetancurt assumes that Pedro del Castillo—Diaz\r\n     calls him ‘el Almirante Pedro Cauallero’—secured Barba\r\n     and his vessel. _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 148; _Cortés_,\r\n     _Residencia_, ii. 165.\r\n\r\n     [960] ‘El capitã Diego de Camargo,’ says Herrera; but Bernal\r\n     Diaz explains that this man stepped into the captaincy on\r\n     the murder of ‘fulano Alvarez Pinedo,’ at Pánuco. ‘Dixeron,\r\n     que el Capitan Camargo auia sido Fraile Dominico, e que\r\n     auia hecho profession.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 114.\r\n\r\n     [961] Seven leagues up, says Herrera.\r\n\r\n     [962] ‘Muerto diez y siete ó diez y ocho cristianos, y\r\n     herido otros muchos. Asimismo ... muerto siete caballos.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 144. Bernal Diaz assumes that the whole\r\n     attacking force was killed and some vessels destroyed.\r\n     ‘Dexaron vna carauela,’ says Herrera.\r\n\r\n     [963] Herrera states that hunger caused the land expedition\r\n     to abandon the vessels some twenty leagues above Almería.\r\n     The people from the wrecked caravel were taken on board the\r\n     last vessel. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xviii. Cortés leaves\r\n     the impression that both vessels arrived at Villa Rica,\r\n     perhaps because the one was wrecked so near it. ‘Vn nauio\r\n     ... y traia sobre sesenta soldados.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 114. This may include the land party, but not\r\n     the sailors.\r\n\r\n     [964] ‘Con hasta treinta hombres de mar y tierra.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 154. ‘Sus soldados, que eran mas de cincuenta,\r\n     y mas siete cauallos,’ says Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     114; and, since Cortés would be less apt to indicate large\r\n     accessions, he may be correct.\r\n\r\n     [965] ‘Este fue el mejor socorro.... Diaz de Auz sirvió muy\r\n     bien a su Magestad en todo lo que se ofreciò en las guerras,\r\n     ... traxo pleyto despues, sobre el pleyto de la mitad de\r\n     Mestitan, ... conque le den la parte de lo que rentare el\r\n     pueblo mas de dos mil y quinientos pesos.’ _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 114-15. He was excluded from the town\r\n     itself, owing to cruel treatment of Indians.\r\n\r\n     [966] ‘El señor de aquel rio y tierra, que se dice Pánuco,\r\n     se habia dado por vasallo de V. M., en cuyo reconocimiento me\r\n     habia enviado á la ciudad de Tenuxtitan, con sus mensajeros,\r\n     ciertas cosas.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 144-5. But this is\r\n     probably a mere assertion, since the Spanish expeditions\r\n     had never been higher than Almería, and the cacique could\r\n     have had no inducement for submitting.\r\n\r\n     [967] Bernal Diaz refers to the last accession from Garay’s\r\n     expeditions as 40 soldiers and 10 horses, under an old man\r\n     named Ramirez. Protected by heavy cotton armor they were\r\n     nicknamed the ‘albardillas.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 115.\r\n\r\n     [968] ‘Si todos ó algunos dellos se quisiesen volver en los\r\n     navíos que allí estaban, que les diese licencia.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 163.\r\n\r\n     [969] _Oviedo_, iii. 335; and so Herrera also intimates\r\n     in reference to Camargo’s only remaining vessel, ‘la qual\r\n     se anegò tãbien dẽtro de 10. dias en el puerto.’ dec. ii.\r\n     lib. x. cap. xviii.\r\n\r\n     [970] The last two vessels bring 150 men and 16 horses,\r\n     probably over 20, to which must be added Camargo’s force,\r\n     amounting no doubt to 50 effective men, for Bernal Diaz\r\n     admits 60 soldiers, not counting sailors; and Herrera\r\n     intimates that over 100 men must have reached Villa Rica of\r\n     the total force on board Camargo’s three vessels. Bernal\r\n     Diaz’ estimates for the five vessels which he enumerates\r\n     exceed 170 soldiers and 20 horses; on fol. 115 he contradicts\r\n     several points, including the total, to which the sailors may\r\n     be added, while a small reduction is to be made for deaths\r\n     among Camargo’s men. Vetancurt follows Bernal Diaz, and so\r\n     does Prescott, who assumes that full 150 men and 20 horses\r\n     must have been obtained. _Mex._, ii. 438. Robertson raises\r\n     this nearer to the truth by saying 180 men, _Hist. Am._,\r\n     ii. 104, as does Brasseur de Bourbourg, who nevertheless,\r\n     on an earlier page, adds Sahagun’s fanciful reinforcement\r\n     of 300 men. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 371, 387. While the\r\n     Spaniards were curing themselves, ‘llegó á Tlaxcala un\r\n     Francisco Hernandez, español, con 300 soldados castellanos\r\n     y con muchos caballos y armas.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._,\r\n     i. 37. The later edition does not give the number. Gomara\r\n     merely states that numerous small parties came over from\r\n     the Antilles, attracted by Cortés’ fame, through Aillon’s\r\n     reports, he seems to say. Many of them were murdered on\r\n     the way, but sufficient numbers reached him to restore the\r\n     army and encourage the prosecution of the conquest. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 173.\r\n\r\n     [971] Said to have been named Francisco Eguia. _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist.

Herrera writes that many assumed the malady to have\r\n     been one of the periodical scourges that used to fall on\r\n     the country. ‘Y el no auer tocado a los Castellanos, parece\r\n     que trae aparencia de razon.’ dec. ii. lib. x. cap. iv. But\r\n     it appears to have been wholly a new disease to the natives.\r\n\r\n     [972] ‘En el mes que llamaban Tepeilhuitl que es al fin de\r\n     setiembre,’ as Sahagun assumes. _Hist.

Chich._, 304; _Id._, _Relaciones_, 413. Others extend\r\n     the rule to 80 days, both as leader and king, perhaps,\r\n     which would agree with Cano’s version.\r\n\r\n     [975] Such characteristics may be seen in Spanish as well\r\n     as native records; yet Solis writes, ‘su tibieza y falta de\r\n     aplicacion dexáse poco menos que borrada entre los suyos\r\n     la memoria de su nombre.’ _Hist. Mex._, 372. Sufficient\r\n     proof of his energy is found in the siege resulting in the\r\n     expulsion from Mexico.\r\n\r\n     [976] The native authorities incline to Quauhtemoc, but the\r\n     Spanish generally add the ‘tzin,’ the ‘c’ being elided,\r\n     and the ‘Q’ changed to ‘G,’ making the name Guatemotzin.\r\n     ‘Quauhtemoc, que significa Aguila que baja.’ _Vetancvrt_,\r\n     _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 51.\r\n\r\n     [977] Bernal Diaz describes him about a year later as 23\r\n     or 24 years old, while on another occasion he alludes to\r\n     him as 25. _Hist. Verdad._, 112, 155. Ixtlilxochitl makes\r\n     him 18. _Hist. Chich._, 304.\r\n\r\n     [978] ‘Por muerte de su Padre gobernaba el Tlatelulco.’\r\n     _Duran_, _Hist.

This\r\n     incorrect view is adopted by Brasseur de Bourbourg and many\r\n     others.\r\n\r\n     [979] ‘Moglie già del suo Zio Cuitlahuatzin,’ is the\r\n     supposition of Clavigero, _Storia Mess._, iii. 160. ‘Se\r\n     hizo temer de tal manera, que todos los suyos temblauan\r\n     dél.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.

Cortés inflicted on them severe chastisement. dec.\r\n     ii. lib. x. cap. xvi. xviii.\r\n\r\n     [984] The reports and other papers by Cortés, written during\r\n     a period of nearly three decades in connection with New\r\n     Spain, are both numerous and lengthy, but only the five\r\n     letters relating to the actual conquest of Mexico and Central\r\n     America have achieved bibliographic celebrity, under the\r\n     title of _Cortés’ Letters or Relations_. Although the first\r\n     letter has been lost, and the companion letter long missing,\r\n     yet an allusion to the expedition against Mexico appeared\r\n     as early as 1520 in _Ein auszug ettlicher sendbrieff dem\r\n     aller durchleüchtigisten grossmechtigistẽ Fürsten ... von\r\n     wegen einer new gefundẽ Inseln. Nürmberg durch Fryderichen\r\n     Peypus am. 17. tag Marcij MDXX._, wherein the voyages of\r\n     Córdoba and Grijalva are also described. Harrisse, _Bib.\r\n     Am. Vet._, 179, assumes that the information is taken\r\n     from Peter Martyr’s _Decades_. A later brief reference\r\n     to the city of Mexico itself is given in _Translationuss\r\n     hispanischer sprach zü Frantzösisch gemacht so durch dẽ\r\n     Vice Rey in Neapole fraw Margareten Hertzogiñ iñ Burgundi\r\n     zü geschrieben_, published in 1522. On folio A. iii. is\r\n     written: Not far from the same island they have conquered\r\n     a city called Tenustitan, wherein 60,000 hearths have been\r\n     counted, within a good wall. The letter of the ayuntamiento\r\n     was first published in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i., 1842.\r\n\r\n     By the time of the receipt in Spain of Cortés’ second\r\n     letter, of October 30, 1520, the general and his conquest\r\n     had become so famous that his communications were not likely\r\n     to be lost sight of. The incidents treated of were besides\r\n     highly enticing, particularly the victories in Tlascala, the\r\n     entry into Montezuma’s wonderful island city, the disastrous\r\n     expulsion, and the renewal of the campaign, and Cromberger\r\n     had it printed in 1522 under the title of _Carta de relaciõ\r\n     ẽbiada a su. S. majestad del ẽpador nt̃o señor por el\r\n     capitã general dela nueua spaña: llamado fernãdo cortes_,\r\n     etc. _Seuilla: por Jacobo crõberger aleman. A viii. dias\r\n     de Nouiẽbre.

An Italian abstract of the\r\n     letter appeared immediately after, as _Noue de le Isole\r\n     & Terra ferma Nouamente trouate In India per el Capitaneo\r\n     de larmata de la Cesarea Maiestate. Mediolani decimosexto\r\n     calẽ. Decembris M.D.XXII._ A reprint of the Seville text\r\n     was issued at Saragossa in January, 1523. A later abridged\r\n     account of the conquest is given in _Ein schöne Newe zeytung\r\n     so Kayserlich Mayestet auss India yetz newlich zükommen\r\n     seind_, ascribed to Sigmund Grimm of Augsburg, about 1522.\r\n     _Bibliotheca Grenvilliana_ and _Harrisse_.

Perhaps 1523 is the more correct\r\n     date, which may also be ascribed to _Tres sacree Imperiale\r\n     et catholique mageste ... eust nouuelles des marches ysles\r\n     et terre ferme occeanes_.

In 1524\r\n     appeared the first Latin version of the second letter, by\r\n     Savorgnanus, _Praeclara Ferdinãdi Cortesii de Noua maris\r\n     Oceani Hyspania Narratio, Norimberga. M.D.XXIIII._, which\r\n     contains a copy of the now lost map of the Gulf of Mexico,\r\n     and also a plan of Mexico City. In the same year two Italian\r\n     translations of this version, by Liburnius, _La Preclara\r\n     Narratione_, were printed at Venice, one by Lexona, the\r\n     other by Sabio, yet both at the instance of Pederzani. The\r\n     plan and map are often missing. Antonio, _Bib. Hisp. Nova_,\r\n     iii. 375, mentions only Lexona’s issue. A translation from\r\n     Flavigny appeared in the _Portfolio_, Philadelphia, 1817.\r\n     The originals of the second and other letters were, in the\r\n     early part of the eighteenth century, ‘en la Libreria de\r\n     Don Miguel Nuñez de Rojas, del Consejo Real de las Ordenes,’\r\n     says Pinelo, _Epitome_, ii. 597. Much of the vagueness which\r\n     involves the narrative of events previous to the flight from\r\n     Mexico may be due to the loss of diary and documents during\r\n     that episode. The loss was convenient to Cortés, since it\r\n     afforded an excuse for glossing over many irregularities\r\n     and misfortunes.\r\n\r\n     The third letter, dated Coyuhuacan, May 15, 1522, and\r\n     relating the siege and fall of Mexico, was first published\r\n     at Seville, on Cromberger’s press, March 30, 1523, as _Carta\r\n     tercera de relaciõ: embiada por Fernãdo cortes capitan\r\n     y justicia mayor del yucatan llamado la nueua espana del\r\n     mar oceano_. It received a reproduction in Latin by the\r\n     same hand and at the same time as the second letter. Both\r\n     were reprinted, together with some missionary letters and\r\n     Peter Martyr’s _De Insulis_, in _De Insvlis nuper Inventis\r\n     Ferdinandi Cortesii. Coloniæ, M.D.XXXII._ The title-page\r\n     displays a portrait of Charles V., and is bordered with his\r\n     arms. Martyr’s part, which tells rather briefly of Cortés,\r\n     found frequent reprint, while the second and third letters\r\n     were republished, with other matter, in the Spanish _Thesoro\r\n     de virtudes_, 1543; in the German _Ferdinandi Cortesii.\r\n     Von dem Newen Hispanien. Augspurg_, 1550, wherein they\r\n     are called first and second narratives, and divided into\r\n     chapters, with considerable liberty; in the Latin _Novus\r\n     Orbis_ of 1555 and 1616; and in the Flemish _Nieuwe Weerelt_\r\n     of 1563; while a French abridgment appeared at Paris in\r\n     1532. The secret epistle accompanying the third letter was\r\n     first printed in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, i., and afterward by\r\n     Kingsborough and Gayangos.\r\n\r\n     The fourth letter, on the progress of conquest after the\r\n     fall of Mexico, dated at Temixtitan (Mexico), October 15,\r\n     1524, was issued at Toledo, 1525, as _La quarta relacion_,\r\n     together with Alvarado’s and Godoy’s reports to Cortés.\r\n     A second edition followed at Valencia the year after.\r\n     The secret letter accompanying it was not published till\r\n     1865, when Icazbalceta, the well known Mexican collector,\r\n     reproduced it in separate black-letter form, and in his\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 470-83.\r\n\r\n     The substance of the above three relations has been given\r\n     in a vast number of collections and histories, while in\r\n     only a limited number have they been reproduced in a full\r\n     or abridged form, the first reproduction being in the\r\n     third volume of _Ramusio Viaggi_, of 1556, 1565, and 1606,\r\n     which contains several other pieces on the conquest, all\r\n     supplied with appropriate headings and marginals. Barcia\r\n     next published them direct from the manuscript, in the\r\n     _Historiadores Primitivos_, i. This collection bears the\r\n     imprint Madrid, 1749, but the letters had already been\r\n     printed in 1731, as Pinelo affirms, _Epitome_, ii. 597.\r\n     Barcia died a few years before his set was issued. From this\r\n     source Archbishop Lorenzana took the version published by\r\n     him under the title of _Historia de Nueva-España_, Mexico,\r\n     1770, which is not free from omissions and faults, though\r\n     provided with valuable notes on localities and customs,\r\n     and supplemented with illustrated pieces on routes and\r\n     native institutions, a map of New Spain by Alzate, an\r\n     article on the Gobierno Politico by Vetancurt, a copy\r\n     of a native tribute-roll from picture records, not very\r\n     accurately explained, and the first map of Lower California\r\n     and adjoining coast, by Castillo, in 1541. This version of\r\n     the letters was reproduced in New York, 1828, with a not\r\n     wholly successful attempt by Del Mar to introduce modern\r\n     spelling. The work is also marked by a number of omissions\r\n     and blunders, and the introductory biographic sketch by\r\n     Robert Sands adds little to its value. An abridgment from\r\n     Lorenzana appeared as _Correspondance de Fernand Cortés,\r\n     par le Vicomte de Flavigny_, Paris, 1778, which obtained\r\n     three reprints during the following year at different\r\n     places. A great many liberties are taken with facts, as may\r\n     be imagined; and the letters are, beside, misnamed first,\r\n     second, and third. From the same source, or perhaps from\r\n     Flavigny, of whom they savor, are _Briefe des Ferdinand\r\n     Cortes_, Heidelberg, 1779, with several reproductions,\r\n     and with notes; and the corrected _Brieven van Ferdinand\r\n     Cortes_, Amsterdam, 1780-1. The first edition in English,\r\n     from Lorenzana, was issued by Folsom, as _Despatches of\r\n     Hernando Cortes_, New York, 1843, also with notes.\r\n\r\n     The fifth letter of the conqueror, on the famous expedition\r\n     to Honduras, dated at Temixtitan, September 3, 1526, lay\r\n     hidden in the Vienna Imperial Library till Robertson’s\r\n     search for the first letter brought it to light. _Hist.\r\n     Am._, i. xi. He made use of it, but the first complete copy\r\n     was not published till of late, in _Col. Doc. Inéd._, iv.\r\n     8-167, reprinted at New York, 1848, and, in translation, in\r\n     the Hakluyt Society collection, London, 1868. It bore no\r\n     date, but the copy found at Madrid has that of September\r\n     3, 1526, and the companion letter printed in _Col. Doc.\r\n     Inéd._, i. 14-23, that of September 11th. This, as well as\r\n     the preceding letters, was issued by Vedia, in Ribadeneyra’s\r\n     _Biblioteca de Autores Españoles_, xxii.; the first three\r\n     letters being taken from Barcia, and the fifth from its MS.\r\n     The letter of the ayuntamiento is given and a bibliographic\r\n     notice of little value. A very similar collection is to be\r\n     found in the _Biblioteca Historica de la Iberia_, i. But\r\n     the most complete reproduction of the principal writings\r\n     by Cortés, and connected with him, is in the _Cartas y\r\n     Relaciones de Hernan Cortés_, Paris, 1866, by Gayangos,\r\n     which contains 26 pieces, beside the relations, chiefly\r\n     letters and memorials to the sovereign, a third of which\r\n     are here printed for the first time. Although a few of\r\n     Lorenzana’s blunders find correction, others are committed,\r\n     and the notes of the archbishop are adopted without credit,\r\n     and without the necessary amendment of date, etc., which\r\n     often makes them absurd. The earliest combined production\r\n     of Cortés’ relations, and many of his other writings, may\r\n     be credited to Peter Martyr, who in his _Decades_ gave the\r\n     substance of all that they relate, although he also mingled\r\n     other versions. Oviedo, in the third volume of his _Hist.\r\n     Gen._, gives two versions of the conquest, the first, p.\r\n     258 et seq., almost a reproduction of Cortés’ letters, and\r\n     the other, p. 506 et seq., from different sources.\r\n\r\n     Beside the relations, there are a number of miscellaneous\r\n     letters, petitions, orders, instructions, and regulations,\r\n     by Cortés, largely published in _Navarrete_, _Col. de\r\n     Viages_; _Col. Doc. Inéd._; _Pacheco_ and _Cárdenas_, _Col.\r\n     Doc._; _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._; _Kingsborough’s Mex.\r\n     Antiq._; _Alaman_, _Disert._, and as appendices to histories\r\n     of Mexico. A special collection is the _Escritos Sueltos\r\n     de Hernan Cortés_, Mex., 1871, forming vol. xii. of the\r\n     _Bib. Hist. de la Iberia_, which presents 43 miscellaneous\r\n     documents from various printed sources, instructions,\r\n     memorials, and brief letters, nearly all of which are filled\r\n     with complaints against ruling men in Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Cortés’ letters have not inaptly been compared by Prescott\r\n     to the Commentaries of Cæsar, for both men were military\r\n     commanders of the highest order, who spoke and wrote like\r\n     soldiers; but their relative positions with regard to the\r\n     superior authorities of their states were different, and\r\n     so were their race feelings, and their times, and these\r\n     features are stamped upon their writings. Cortés was not the\r\n     powerful consul, the commander of legions, but the leader\r\n     of a horde of adventurers, and an aspirant for favor, who\r\n     made his narrative an advocate. The simplicity and energy\r\n     of the style lend an air of truth to the statements, and\r\n     Helps, among others, is so impressed thereby as to declare\r\n     that Cortés ‘would as soon have thought of committing a small\r\n     theft as of uttering a falsehood in a despatch addressed to\r\n     his sovereign.’ _Cortés_, ii. 211. But it requires little\r\n     study of the reports to discover that they are full of\r\n     calculated misstatements, both direct and negative, made\r\n     whenever he considered it best for his interest to conceal\r\n     disagreeable and discreditable facts, or to magnify the\r\n     danger and the deed. They are also stamped with the religious\r\n     zeal and superstition of the age, the naïve expressions of\r\n     reliance on God being even more frequent than the measured\r\n     declarations of devotedness to the king; while in between\r\n     are calmly related the most cold-blooded outrages on behalf\r\n     of both. There is no apparent effort to attract attention\r\n     to himself; there is even at times displayed a modesty most\r\n     refreshing in the narrative of his own achievements, by\r\n     which writers have as a rule been quite entranced; but this\r\n     savors of calculation, for the general tone is in support\r\n     of the _ego_, and this often to the exclusion of deserving\r\n     officers. Indeed, generous allusions to the character or\r\n     deeds of others are not frequent, or they are merged in\r\n     the non-committing term of ‘one of my captains.’ Pedro de\r\n     Alvarado complains of this in one of his _Relaciones_, in\r\n     _Barcia_, _Hist. Prim._, i. 165-6. In truth, the calculating\r\n     egotism of the diplomate mingles freely with the frankness\r\n     of the soldier. Cortés, however, is ever mindful of his\r\n     character as an hidalgo, for he never stoops to meanness,\r\n     and even in speaking of his enemies he does not resort to\r\n     the invectives or sharp insinuations which they so freely\r\n     scatter. His style bears evidence of training in rhetoric\r\n     and Latin, yet the parade of the latter is not so frequent\r\n     as might be expected from the half-bred student and zealot.\r\n     Equally indicative are his regulations and instructions\r\n     of the experience gained as notary and alcalde, and the\r\n     promise once entertained of him as a legal light. The\r\n     sentences are remarkably concise and clear for the time,\r\n     and the expression both fluent and pure. The whole tends\r\n     to confirm the opinion already formed of his character,\r\n     as one who, while not wholly free from defects of his age,\r\n     indulged in grand views, and stood forward conspicuous as\r\n     a born leader of men.\r\n\r\n     [985] Of the central provinces actually under control\r\n     Herrera enumerates: Cempoala, with 50 towns and villages,\r\n     containing over 120,000 families; Tlascala, with 60 vassal\r\n     lords, over 120,000; Huexotzinco, 50,000; Cholula, 40,000;\r\n     Tepeaca, Acatzingo, and Quecholac, 80,000; Quauhquechollan\r\n     and Itzucan, 20,000; ‘beside a number of others.’ dec. ii.\r\n     lib. x. cap. xviii.\r\n\r\n     [986] Narvaez it was, they said, who without right or\r\n     without exhibiting evidence of such right, had set himself\r\n     up against Cortés, and begun to rouse the natives against\r\n     him and his followers as piratical intruders, intent on\r\n     mischief, while his own announced object was to right the\r\n     natives, release Montezuma, and then to depart from the\r\n     country without taking even gold with him. These intrigues\r\n     caused the uprising which lost Mexico to the emperor,\r\n     together with so many hundred lives and millions of treasure.\r\n     To Velazquez, therefore, no control should be given in a\r\n     country lost through the machinations of himself and his\r\n     lieutenant. If any grants had been made to him, they were\r\n     based on false representations, and would imperil the safety\r\n     of these extensive and rich lands. The second object of the\r\n     latter was to laud the character of Cortés as a man and\r\n     soldier, and to pray that he be confirmed in the office\r\n     of captain-general and justicia mayor as the only fit\r\n     and worthy person. At the foot came the signature of 534\r\n     Spaniards, the majority of the troops, headed by Alvarado,\r\n     Ordaz, and similar warm friends of the commander, and also\r\n     by such prominent personages of the Narvaez party as Vasco\r\n     Porcallo, and Juan Diaz, the clergyman. Bernal Diaz was\r\n     still down with fever, which accounts for the absence of\r\n     his name. Many others whose names might have been added\r\n     were probably away on expeditions and on garrison duty.\r\n     For copy of letter see _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 427-36.\r\n\r\n     [987] Whom Bernal Diaz calls Francisco Álvarez Chico; and\r\n     Vetancurt, Francisco Hernandez.\r\n\r\n     [988] Bernal Diaz insinuates that there were a number of\r\n     officers far more suitable than Captain Ávila for this\r\n     mission, but Cortés desired to be rid of so outspoken an\r\n     observer and champion of the men, and at the same time to\r\n     promote the more pliable Alonso de Grado to the vacated\r\n     contaduría, and the devoted Andrés de Tapia to the captaincy.\r\n     He thinks that Grado, or Alonso de Cáceres, the rich, should\r\n     have been sent. _Hist. Verdad._, 117. His insinuation cannot\r\n     be wholly correct, however, since Ávila had already been for\r\n     some time alcalde mayor of New Spain, and Grado, contador.\r\n     See _Lejalde_, _Probanza_, in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._,\r\n     i. 419 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [989] ‘Despues de ganado Mexico, le llamamos Solis el de la\r\n     huerta, yerno de ... Bachiller Ortega.’ _Hist. Verdad._, 118.\r\n\r\n     [990] This author indicates the despatch of only three\r\n     vessels for Spain, Española, and Jamaica, respectively, one\r\n     of which, or a fourth, conveyed the returning adherents of\r\n     Narvaez. _Id._, 117. But Cortés writes: ‘Envio á la isla\r\n     Española cuatro navíos para que luego vuelvan cargados de\r\n     caballos y gente.’ _Cartas_, 154, 162. The Jamaica vessel\r\n     is probably included in this number.\r\n\r\n     [991] Bernal Diaz names twelve of those who returned, two\r\n     going merely to bring their children. Pilot Cárdenas, whose\r\n     clamor at the treasure repartition at Mexico had called the\r\n     attention of Cortés, was allowed to return to his family,\r\n     with a present of 300 pesos from the general, only to join\r\n     the ranks of his enemies. With one of the Cubans Cortés sent\r\n     some bullion and jewels to his wife and brother-in-law.\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 117; _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro\r\n     Mex._, pt. iii. 148.\r\n\r\n     [992] Cáceres also joined the commissioners. _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 117. Clavigero names Ordaz as the sole\r\n     commissioner, and he was probably the principal. _Storia\r\n     Mess._, iii. 160.\r\n\r\n     [993] ‘Para el camino de la costa de la mar no hay mas\r\n     de dos puertos muy agros y ásperos, que confinan con esta\r\n     dicha provincia.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 145. ‘Que señoreaua\r\n     los puertos, el vno que se dize de Siculchima, por donde\r\n     los Castellanos entraron en aquellas partes, y el otro\r\n     de Quochula, legua y media de Tepeaca, por donde van los\r\n     caminos Reales de la villa Rica.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib.\r\n     x. cap. xvi.\r\n\r\n     [994] ‘Le auian pedido presidio.’ _Id._ Cortés gives merely\r\n     the strategic motives.\r\n\r\n     [995] Francisco de Solis, Cristóbal Corral, and Cristóbal\r\n     Martin are mentioned as regidores in _Probanza de Lejalde_,\r\n     in _Icazbalceta_, _Col. Doc._, i. 418-19. Herrera adds to\r\n     their ranks Gerónimo de Aguilar, the interpreter, ‘porque\r\n     sabia Cortes honrar ... los benemeritos.’ dec. ii. lib.\r\n     x. cap. xvi. The villa was removed after the conquest to\r\n     a new site in the plain, not far from the old town. In\r\n     1545 it received the dignity of a city, and has ever since\r\n     ranked as a district seat, supported to some extent by\r\n     woollen factories. Of the strong fortress erected by the\r\n     conquerors the remains are still to be seen in the plaza\r\n     under the name of el Rollo de Tepeaca. _Chimalpain_, _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, ii. 8; and in _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840),\r\n     145-6. In _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xxi. is given a\r\n     description of the city and district. _Clavigero_, _Storia\r\n     Mess._, iii. 153; _Villa-Señor y Sanchez_, _Theatro_, i.\r\n     248; _Alcedo_, in _Dic. Univ._, v.\r\n\r\n     [996] ‘Tambien me movió á facer los dichos esclavos por\r\n     poner algun espanto á los de Culúa, y porque tambien hay\r\n     tanta gente, que si no ficiese grande y cruel castigo\r\n     en ellos, nunca se emendarian.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 144;\r\n     _Oviedo_, iii. 334. ‘Otros dizen que sin partido los tomo\r\n     a todos, y castigo asi aquellos en venganza, y por no auer\r\n     obedecido sus requerimiẽtos, por putos, por ydolatras,’\r\n     etc. _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 168.\r\n\r\n     [997] _Hist. Verdad._, 116. This was probably the case, and\r\n     Tapia’s testimony appears to confirm it in saying that of the\r\n     6000 captives taken from the Tecamachalco region the males,\r\n     2000 in number, were slaughtered in cold blood. _Cortés_,\r\n     _Residencia_, i. 59. Perhaps it would be more correct to\r\n     assume that a few were killed to expiate the murder of\r\n     Spaniards, while the rest were given to the Tlascaltecs.\r\n\r\n     [998] ‘Saluo a las mugeres y niños,’ says Herrera, which\r\n     leads Brasseur de Bourbourg to assume that women and children\r\n     were not enslaved. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 370. ‘Creyerõ, q̄\r\n     a cada soldado bolveriã sus pieças, y q̄ apreciarian que\r\n     tantos pesos valian, y que como las apreciassen, pagassen\r\n     el quinto a su Magestad.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     116-17. This could hardly have been the case.\r\n\r\n     [999] ‘Mandò Cortes vender a muchos que auia prendido ...\r\n     aplicando vna parte a su exercito, y a otra la republica\r\n     de Tlascala, sacando primero el quinto que pertenecia al\r\n     Rey.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xv. ‘Y despues otro\r\n     quinto para Cortez,’ adds Vetancurt, _Teatro Mex._, pt.\r\n     iii. 148, and this appears correct; yet Clavigero and many\r\n     others do not refer to the second fifth. This deduction\r\n     was declared to be an attempt at installing a second king.\r\n     The deceit practised, as they claimed, at the distribution\r\n     of treasure at Mexico was again called up, and declared\r\n     to be less outrageous than the present effort to defraud\r\n     poor and wounded soldiers of the prize for which they had\r\n     shed their blood. Juan Bono de Quexo declared that he would\r\n     complain to the emperor, and others were no less bitter.\r\n     Previous to this a cause for dissatisfaction had been given\r\n     by a proclamation of Cortés ordering the surrender of all\r\n     gold saved from the common treasure at Mexico, thrown open\r\n     to the soldiers on the eve of the flight. One third was\r\n     to be retained by the possessor. Many refused to comply,\r\n     and since the royal officials and leaders had shared in\r\n     the treasure, the proclamation was allowed to lapse. What\r\n     had been surrendered Cortés kept as a loan. _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 116-117.\r\n\r\n     [1000] ‘Buenas, ò malas Indias, sacallas al almoneda ...\r\n     que se venderia.’ _Id._ This was to be done at the next\r\n     distribution in Tezcuco. The proceeding was discussed at\r\n     length in Spain, and favored also by a large body of the\r\n     clergy, as justifiable; but the emperor took the humane\r\n     course of allowing captives to be held only as prisoners,\r\n     so long as this was absolutely necessary. _Solis_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, ii. 233.\r\n\r\n     [1001] The party commissioned to carry the Villa Rican share\r\n     of the Aztec treasure from Tlascala to the coast. Bernal\r\n     Diaz intimates that another party of nine were killed at\r\n     Xocotlan. _Hist.

Mex._, 172.\r\n     Bernal Diaz speaks of a second expedition to Xocotlan,\r\n     with 30 cavalry and 100 infantry; but this must be owing\r\n     to a confusion of names, in one case the valley, Cacatami,\r\n     being mentioned, in the other the town, Cocotlan. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 116.\r\n\r\n     [1005] _Gomara_, _Hist.

Verdad._, 118.\r\n\r\n     [1011] Camargo gives at length the speeches of Cortés\r\n     and the chiefs on the occasion. The latter invites him\r\n     to accept their friendship and services, and settle among\r\n     them, whereupon the general explains that the main object\r\n     of his coming is to overthrow false idols, and that the\r\n     condition of his staying with them must be the adoption\r\n     of the true faith, wherein lies the sole reason for the\r\n     superiority of his race over theirs. The holy ghost assists\r\n     to impress his words, and they yield; but they implore him\r\n     not to cast down the revered idols, for such an act may be\r\n     fraught with the most terrible disasters. Cortés insists,\r\n     and promises to assume all risks. Thus pressed, they ask\r\n     to confer with the representatives of the people, lest a\r\n     revolt occur. The council objects, offers to give the most\r\n     prominent place to the new gods, and finally yields, amidst\r\n     tears and wailing. The people secretly hide the adored\r\n     images, and while accepting baptism still retain the old\r\n     worship in secret. The four chiefs first receive the rite,\r\n     under the sponsorship of the leading Spanish captains,\r\n     Maxixcatzin the elder being named Lorenzo; Xicotencatl,\r\n     Vicente; Tlehuexolotl, Gonzalo; and Citlalpopoca, Bartolomé.\r\n     The general baptism followed, those baptized on the first\r\n     day being named Juan, and María, and Ana, for men and women\r\n     respectively, each receiving a ticket whereon the name was\r\n     written. Many forgot their names, nevertheless, and had to\r\n     appeal to the register; some received baptism over again,\r\n     because they failed to acknowledge the previous rite, and\r\n     others attended service for years without having been to\r\n     the font. Among the idols and relics saved from the general\r\n     destruction were the ashes of Camaxtli, the chief god of the\r\n     tribe, said by some to have been the brother of Tezcatlipoca,\r\n     by others the father of Quetzalcoatl. They were jealously\r\n     guarded by the chief Tecpanecatl Tecuhtli, of Tepeticpac,\r\n     till 1576, when, tired of the temporal injuries which were\r\n     falling upon him, owing to their presence in his house, he\r\n     turned to the Church and surrendered the relic, and died\r\n     the same week, on holy Thursday, while penitently lashing\r\n     himself before the madonna. On opening the envelope of the\r\n     relic a mass of blonde hair fell out, showing that tradition\r\n     was true in describing the god as a white man. _Camargo_,\r\n     _Hist. Tlax._, 151-9, 178-9. Brasseur de Bourbourg eagerly\r\n     seizes on this statement to support his theory that the\r\n     Toltecs had come from the north of Europe to found their\r\n     empire and era of culture in Mexico. _Hist. Nat. Civ._,\r\n     iv. 392 et seq. Camargo places the general baptism on the\r\n     occasion of Cortés’ first arrival in the republic, but\r\n     herein Torquemada corrects him, although following the\r\n     version in other respects. The picture in the convent\r\n     at Tlascala indicates, he says, that the four chiefs,\r\n     including the elder Maxixcatzin, were baptized together,\r\n     and by the clergyman Juan Diaz. Great festivals followed\r\n     the ceremony, i. 523, iii. 166-9. Ixtlilxochitl, who also\r\n     refers to this picture, follows Camargo’s date, but names\r\n     Xicotencatl senior Bartolomé, Zitlapopocatzin Baltasar,\r\n     Tlehuexolotzin Gonzalo, and Maxixcatzin, a young man, Juan.\r\n     _Hist. Chich._, 294. Brasseur de Bourbourg corrects this by\r\n     substituting Xicotencatl junior for Maxixcatzin and naming\r\n     him Vicente. He adds Nezahualpilli’s son Tecocoltzin, who\r\n     receives the name of Fernando, ubi sup. The assumption\r\n     that the four elder chiefs were baptized together, and the\r\n     statement that the elder Maxixcatzin had died before Cortés\r\n     returned to Tlascala, appear contradictory, but Vetancurt\r\n     reconciles them by dating the general baptism just before the\r\n     beginning of the Tepeaca campaign, and adopting the names\r\n     as given on the picture in ‘our convent,’ and as quoted by\r\n     Camargo and Torquemada. Padre Juan Diaz, who performed the\r\n     rite, is supposed to have been killed soon after. Several\r\n     other versions of his fate and burial-place are given.\r\n     _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 146. But he testified\r\n     during the residencia investigation against Alvarado, 1529.\r\n     See _Ramirez_, _Proceso contra Alvarado_, 124. Clavigero\r\n     follows Vetancurt, and maintains, notwithstanding the\r\n     failure of the conquest writers to notice that event, that\r\n     ‘è certo, che tutti i quattro Capi di quella Repubblica\r\n     furono battezzati avanti la conquista.... Oltre ad’ altre\r\n     pruove ciò consta dalle pitture antiche.’ _Storia Mess._,\r\n     iii. 150. It would be interesting to know what the ‘altre\r\n     pruove’ are. Prescott admits only the baptism of the two\r\n     Maxixcatzins and old Xicotencatl, but avoids giving the new\r\n     names, owing to the conflict of authorities. _Mex._, ii. 445.\r\n\r\n     [1012] ‘Cómo era Muchacho, imprimió mas en él nuestra\r\n     conversacion y tornóse cristiano.’ _Cartas_, 177.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF THE FLEET.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1520-FEBRUARY, 1521.\r\n\r\n     THE OBJECTIVE POINT—VESSELS NEEDED—MARTIN LOPEZ SENT TO\r\n     TLASCALA FOR TIMBER—THIRTEEN BRIGANTINES ORDERED—CORTÉS\r\n     AT TLASCALA—DRILL AND DISCIPLINE—ADDRESS OF THE\r\n     GENERAL—PARADE OF THE TLASCALTECS—MARCH TO TEZCUCO—NEW RULER\r\n     APPOINTED—SACKING OF IZTAPALAPAN—THE CHALCANS—ARRIVAL AT\r\n     TEZCUCO OF THE BRIGANTINE BRIGADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tepeaca campaign had been only part of the plan conceived during\r\nthe flight to Tlascala for the recovery of the dominating point of\r\nthe empire. The strength of the capital, and the ascendancy acquired\r\nby the Aztecs during Spanish exclusion from the lake region, made it\r\nimpossible to strike directly at the centre of the uprising. It was\r\nnecessary first to conquer the surrounding provinces on which Mexico\r\ndepended for aid, and to do this in detail was easier than to meet the\r\ncombined strength of the foe. This would also leave the conquering\r\ntroops free to turn their whole attention against the capital, with\r\nfresh allies and larger resources. A centre for operation was now\r\nneeded within the valley, and one from which the Aztecs might be\r\nattacked in due time both by land and water. For this object Tezcuco\r\npresented the greatest advantages in being situated on the lake,\r\nsome six leagues from Mexico, in the midst of a fertile country, and\r\nnear enough to Tlascala, from and through which reinforcements might\r\nreadily be obtained.[1013]\r\n\r\nWith a prudent foresight to these movements Cortés had shortly after\r\nhis first successes in Tepeaca sent Martin Lopez, the shipwright, to\r\nTlascala to prepare timber for thirteen brigantines, which were to be\r\ntransported to the lake for besieging purposes. The republic offered to\r\nprovide material and native carpenters, and aided by Andrés Nuñez and\r\nothers, Lopez soon formed an efficient corps of assistants for felling\r\nand shaping the pieces, as modelled and numbered by himself. The\r\nsite of construction was at Atempan, on the Rio Zahuatl,[1014] which\r\nafforded the necessary water for the trial launch, and had forests\r\nnear by from which timber, masts, and pitch could be obtained.[1015]\r\nIron, sails, cordage, and other needful articles taken from the sunken\r\nfleet were forwarded from Villa Rica, together with smiths and other\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of Cortés at Tlascala, preparations receive a fresh\r\nimpulse, and weapons and armor are overhauled, pikes and arrows made,\r\nand stores collected. An opportune addition is made by the arrival of\r\na vessel from Spain and the Canaries, laden with war material, bows,\r\nbowstrings, arquebuses, powder, and a variety of goods; also over a\r\ndozen soldiers, with three horses. Cortés purchases the whole cargo,\r\nand persuades the owner, Juan de Búrgos, the captain, and the men to\r\njoin him.[1016]\r\n\r\nDrill receives attention, and equally necessary is the maintenance\r\nof order, for they are few, remote from succor, and surrounded by a\r\npowerful, warlike, and astute foe. Then they must maintain friendly\r\nrelations with their allies, whose aid is essential to the achievement\r\nof their plans. One hasty utterance, one unjust act, can raise a storm\r\nwherein all may perish. Good treatment on every hand is necessary to\r\nwin neutral and hostile provinces. It is often easier to persuade than\r\nto enforce. With this view Cortés, as captain-general and justicia\r\nmayor for his majesty, prepares a series of regulations which are\r\nproclaimed on the 26th of December 1520.\r\n\r\nIn a lengthy preamble are set forth some reasons for its publication\r\nand the necessity for good conduct, as recognized not only in human\r\nbut in divine affairs, and practised since time immemorial for the\r\nregulation of wars.\r\n\r\nThe first article proclaims the primary motive of this, and indeed of\r\nall their campaigns, to be spiritual conquest, in the absence of which\r\nmaterial conquests must be regarded as unjust. Blasphemy is forbidden\r\nlest the offended Almighty should refuse his assistance. Gambling in\r\na modified form is permitted, but quarrelling is prohibited.\r\n\r\nRules are laid down for discipline in camp and field for sentinels,\r\nfor prompt and courageous performance of duty. No Spaniard may enter\r\nhouses in a hostile city to plunder until the foe has been driven\r\nforth and victory secured; and booty of whatsoever nature, however\r\nand wherever acquired, must be declared before the proper officers,\r\nunder penalty of death. Any captain who attacks an enemy without\r\norders shall be put to death.[1017]\r\n\r\nOrders were also issued to regulate the prices of clothing and\r\naccoutrements, which were excessive. In order to enforce the necessary\r\nrespect for the regulations, Cortés punished the earlier infringements\r\nwith a severity even in excess of the penalty proclaimed. Two of\r\nthe general’s own negro slaves were hanged for petty theft, and a\r\npilfering soldier was pardoned only when half strangled.[1018]\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight of rest and preparation Cortés concluded to resume\r\nthe campaign, partly lest a longer delay should cool the ardor of\r\nthe soldiers and allies. On the day following Christmas the troops\r\nwere mustered for review in the main square of Tlascala, where Cortés\r\nin velvet-covered mail stood surrounded by the royal officials, the\r\nleading chiefs of the republic, and a brilliant suite. First marched\r\nthe cross-bowmen in double file, who at a signal discharged their arms\r\naloft and passed on with a salute. After them came the shield-bearers,\r\nwaving their swords, which they sheathed after saluting; then the\r\npikemen with copper-headed pikes, followed by arquebusiers, who saluted\r\nwith a thundering salvo that reëchoed along the circling hills and\r\nsent a tremor through the crowd of native spectators. Last came the\r\ncavalry, prancing and skirmishing in rapid evolutions, to display\r\ntheir skill as fighters and riders, and to dazzle the beholders with\r\ntheir glittering arms and adornment. The total force consisted of\r\nfive hundred and fifty infantry, divided into nine companies, and\r\nforty cavalry in four squads, with nine small pieces of artillery,\r\neighty cross-bows and arquebuses.[1019]\r\n\r\nThe main reliance of the infantry was in the swords and pikes, the long\r\nChinantec poles being largely introduced, even among the allies, and\r\nmade effective by long drilling. The nucleus of the troops, whereon\r\nrested the highest hopes, was of course the horsemen, whose safety\r\nhad been carefully looked to by providing the steeds with poitrels,\r\nand side and quarter coverings of stout bulls’-hide, reaching to the\r\nhocks. They were fringed with small pieces of iron which jingled like\r\nbells, and were supposed to add to the terror ever spread by these\r\nanimals among the natives.[1020] The riders were equally protected,\r\nsome with helmet and body mail of steel, which covered even the limbs,\r\nleaving the wearer vulnerable only at the joints.[1021] Others had\r\nless complete mail, while many possessed only the twisted cotton armor\r\nworn by the foot-soldiers, though this was sufficiently effective\r\nin native warfare. Thus was experience rapidly developing the art of\r\nwar in America.\r\n\r\nThe troops having fallen into line, Cortés advanced on horseback and\r\naddressed them. They had mustered for a most important enterprise,\r\nto recover the rich provinces once acquired but wrested from them by\r\ntreacherous rebels, to elevate the holy faith insulted by idolaters,\r\nand to avenge the blood of cruelly murdered friends and comrades. “Just\r\nare the reasons which impel us,” cried the speaker, “and necessary\r\nto our security. Spaniards! God has ever favored you; therefore be\r\nfearless. Let your conduct be such as to inspire with respect and\r\nconfidence our stout and tried allies, a hundred thousand and more\r\nof whom stand ready and eager to join us. What more can Christian\r\nsoldiers desire than the double favors which God here giveth us, rich\r\nrewards in temporal blessings and that glory immortal which follows\r\nvictory?” Thus the astute commander stirred the hearts of his men;\r\nand believing his own words, was himself stirred thereby. And the\r\nshout came back to him that they would regain the lost and avenge\r\nthemselves on the exultant Tenochtitlans.[1022]\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone by foreigners, next morning the Tlascaltecs marched\r\ninto the plaza to the sound of conchs, pipes, and drums, the four\r\nlords at the head richly attired and in plumage studded with precious\r\nstones, which rose a yard above their heads in variegated colors,\r\ndenoting their rank and achievements. Following them were four squires\r\nbearing their weapons, and the standard-bearers of the respective\r\nquarters. Then in files of twenty deep came the regular warriors,\r\ndivided into archers, shieldmen, and pikemen, and into companies, each\r\nwith its ensigns and musicians. A striking spectacle they presented\r\nin their orderly lines, gay with flowing plumes, glittering arms, and\r\nmany-colored devices; some of the latter displayed on a broad plane\r\nof shields extended; others embroidered on the quilted cotton tunics\r\nof leading warriors. All together formed a series of gay streaks\r\nbroken by wider bronze-hued masses of naked rank and file, while above\r\nall heads rose a profusion of feather-work banners, speckled with\r\nbrilliant ornaments.[1023] These were lowered as the companies passed\r\nbefore Cortés, who doffed his cap in acknowledgment, the warriors\r\nresponding by bending the head and discharging their bows. Their\r\nnumber on this occasion has been estimated as high as one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand, and although this is evidently exaggerated, there\r\nis no doubt that the large Tlascaltec army was swelled by companies\r\nfrom the neighboring provinces.[1024]\r\n\r\nThe march over, Cortés addressed the allies, extolling their deeds\r\nwhich had covered the republic with glory. Soon again would they\r\nadd to its renown and its wealth, while avenging ancient wrongs. He\r\nwould see to it that their services were recognized by the emperor.\r\nA small proportion would accompany him on the present march; the\r\nremainder could follow after the completion of the brigantines.[1025]\r\nIn orthodox cheers the native warriors testified approbation. Their\r\ngeneral then spoke, exhorting them ever to remember that they were\r\nTlascaltecs, a name of terror to all foes. Only twenty thousand of the\r\neager republicans, including some Huexotzincas and the carriers, were\r\nallowed to join the expedition, for more could not be conveniently used\r\nduring the preliminary campaign. Their general was Chichimecatl.[1026]\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the 28th of December, after the invocation of\r\ndivine aid, and midst the stirring strains of music, the army filed\r\nout of Tlascala, the populace lining the route and shouting their\r\nfarewell blessings. “The gods grant you victory!” they cried, “and\r\nsuccessful return.” “There go the strong ones to humble the proud,”\r\nsaid some, while of the women many sobbed: “Oh! if our eyes should\r\nnever behold you again!” There were three routes leading into the\r\nlake provinces, two of them tried already during former marches; but\r\nsince the enemy were doubtless on the alert with ambuscades and other\r\nmeasures, it was deemed best to select the third and worst road,\r\nnorth of snow-crowned Iztaccihuatl, by which an approach would be\r\nleast expected.[1027] This led through Tezmeluca,[1028] a village in\r\nHuexotzinco, six leagues from Tlascala, where camp was formed. Here\r\nbegan a three-league ascent of the pass, and the Tezcucan border\r\nwas crossed amidst intense cold, the gradually dwindling vegetation\r\ngiving freer scope to the bleak wind which came whistling from the\r\nsummits. A league farther a convenient spot was found for a halt,\r\nand the tired and shivering soldiers were soon huddling round fires.\r\nOn the following day a thick pine forest was entered, and soon after\r\nthe road was found blocked with felled trees. This created no little\r\nstir among the men, but Cortés, who had not expected an unobstructed\r\npath, sent forward a body of natives to clear it.[1029] With forces\r\nmassed and arms prepared, Cortés thereupon led the way, and in half a\r\nleague open ground was gained, to the relief of all. The difficulties\r\nof the march were passed, and behind the army now lay the grim expanse\r\nof barren rocks and hoary peaks; while beneath a pale-blue sky they\r\ndescended the wooded slopes to the valley below, rich in variegated\r\nhues of field and garden, and enlivened with the gleaming white of\r\nhuman habitation. Beyond spread the glassy surface of the lakes,\r\nbordered on the farther side by the misty outline of low ranges,\r\nfading in the distance like the glories of the now fading empire. The\r\nqueen city was the theme, however, and while some descanted to late\r\nrecruits on its wealth and beauties, others stood silently gazing on\r\nthe spot so dimmed with sad remembrances. Thus pondering on the past\r\nthey could almost hear the voices of fallen comrades calling on them\r\nfor vengeance, and “we vowed,” writes Cortés, “there to achieve victory\r\nor perish.”[1030] As if in response to the challenge, ominous smoke\r\ncolumns rose from the circling heights, the signal of the Mexicans\r\nto rouse the inhabitants against the invaders.\r\n\r\nNo opposition was met during the descent, but beyond a ravine, on level\r\nground, forces were seen approaching from different directions.[1031]\r\nBy a quick movement Cortés managed to leave the broken ground and gain\r\nthe bridges ere the foe had united. Having now a plain before them,\r\nfifteen of the horsemen charged and routed the main body. The rest\r\ndispersed, with the Tlascaltecs in close pursuit to kill and ravage.\r\nThe army did not camp till they reached the deserted Coatepec, some\r\nthree leagues from Tezcuco.\r\n\r\nShortly before this there had been an accession in the person of\r\nIxtlilxochitl,[1032] the ruler of the northern part of Acolhuacan, who\r\nhad offered his friendship to the Spaniards before they ever entered\r\nthe valley. His faith in them was unshaken, particularly under the\r\naspect of their late successes, and he came to renew his protestations,\r\nassuring Cortés that no opposition would be offered at Tezcuco. He gave\r\ninformation about the political feeling, the prospect for humbling\r\nthe hated Aztecs, and the fate of certain small bodies of Spaniards\r\nduring the uprising. He also stated that Cuicuetzcatl was no more.\r\nWhile at Tepeaca, Cortés had sent to Cohuanacoch, the usurper king at\r\nTezcuco, an Acolhua noble,[1033] with peaceful proposals. The envoy was\r\nexecuted. Not long after, Cuicuetzcatl set out for Tezcuco, without\r\nleave, tired as he was of the semi-captive restraint at Tlascala,\r\nand confident that with the aid of his adherents and the prestige of\r\nSpanish success he would be able to overthrow his usurping brother\r\nand resume the sceptre entrusted him by Montezuma and Cortés. The\r\npresence of so powerful an intriguer in the capital could not long\r\nescape the spies of Cohuanacoch, who had him seized, and by the advice\r\nof Quauhtemotzin summarily removed from his path.[1034]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough fully a hundred thousand warriors were rumored to be hovering\r\nhereabout, no formidable evidences of hostility were encountered during\r\nthe march to Tezcuco. A short distance from Coatepec a procession of\r\nAcolhua nobles appeared, headed by four prominent personages, and\r\nbearing a golden banner as a peace offering. They came in the name\r\nof Cohuanacoch to tender his submission and the hospitality of the\r\ncity, with the request that no ravages be committed. After what he had\r\nlearned Cortés could hardly look upon their master as other than an\r\ninimical usurper, whose tardy proffers could not be trusted, and whose\r\nopposition need not be feared. He accordingly received the message\r\ncoldly, referred to the treacherous slaughter of the Yuste party of\r\nfifty Spaniards and three hundred Tlascaltecs, and demanded that at\r\nleast the treasures seized on that occasion should be restored; failing\r\nin which, a thousand natives should die for every Spaniard killed. The\r\nenvoys tremblingly explained that the outrage had been committed by\r\nZoltepecs at the instance of the Aztec ruler, whose men had carried\r\noff the valuables. Still, they would institute a search.[1035]\r\n\r\nRegardless of their urgent request that the entry into the capital\r\nshould be deferred till quarters had been prepared, Cortés proceeded\r\nthrough the outlying suburbs of Coatlichan and Huexotla, where the\r\nchiefs came forth to render homage, and passed on Monday, the 31st\r\nof December, into Tezcuco, which was for many a month to be his\r\n‘halting-place,’ as the name signifies.[1036] Quarters were taken up\r\nin Nezahualcoyotl’s palace, as the largest and strongest place.[1037]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some soldiers who had ascended a tower came to report that\r\nthe inhabitants were hurrying away by land and water. Cortés now\r\nunderstood why the envoys had sought to detain him on the road, and\r\ngave immediate orders to seize the ruler and as many leading men as\r\npossible. It was too late, however. Cohuanacoch had escaped. After\r\nusurping the throne, combining with the foes of the Spaniards, and\r\nmurdering the ruler appointed by them, he did not dare to trust himself\r\nwithin their reach. Hence, as the invaders marched in he embarked for\r\nMexico with his family, his chief adherents and treasures, attended by\r\na fleet of canoes with fugitives and effects. The anger of Cortés at\r\nthis escape encouraged the pursuing troops to commit certain excesses;\r\nand in this they could hardly be blamed, for in one of the temples\r\nwere found relics of the Yuste party, which very naturally fired the\r\nsoldiers with a desire for vengeance.[1038] Ixtlilxochitl and other\r\nfriendly chiefs implored pity for the unoffending inhabitants, and\r\norders were issued in accordance, though not until the allies had\r\nsacked a number of houses and fired the beautiful Nezahualpilli palace\r\ncontaining the national archives.[1039]\r\n\r\nNot knowing what might follow this exodus, Cortés hastened to fortify\r\nhis quarters and to collect supplies, aided by Ixtlilxochitl, who\r\nhad succeeded somewhat in reassuring the people. In order to restore\r\nconfidence, however, and win the inhabitants to his purposes, he saw\r\nthat there should be a recognized head, with influence to control\r\nthem, and one whom he could trust. The former necessity demanded that\r\nthe choice should be made among the brothers of Cohuanacoch, children\r\nof Nezahualpilli, and of these Ixtlilxochitl and Tecocoltzin were\r\nthe only professed friends of the Spaniards. The latter was of less\r\nlegitimate birth, it seems, than some of the brothers, and a mere\r\nyouth, who had shared the _quasi_ captivity of Cuicuetzcatl, and had\r\naccepted baptism with the name of Fernando Cortés de Monroy.[1040]\r\nHe was tall and well formed, of noble presence, and as fair as the\r\naverage Spaniard. Of docile disposition, he had readily conformed to\r\nthe teachings of the friars, had adopted Spanish ideas, and had become\r\na favorite among the conquerors. It may be readily understood that\r\nthis easily ruled boy should be preferred by Cortés to Ixtlilxochitl,\r\nwhose stay in Tezcuco during the troublous times had not tended to\r\nstrengthen Spanish confidence.\r\n\r\nCortés summoned the chiefs and represented that since Cohuanacoch\r\nhad forfeited any claims that he might have had to the throne, by\r\nmurdering the lawfully elected king and by abandoning his country,\r\nthey should therefore choose another ruler. He took care that his\r\nselection should become known to them, and the electors hastened to\r\nconform to the conqueror’s will, not even Ixtlilxochitl venturing to\r\nremonstrate.[1041]\r\n\r\nFernando was accordingly brought from Tlascala soon after and installed\r\nwith great ceremony, receiving a Spanish dress with arms.[1042] He\r\nproved kind and faithful, particularly to his patrons, yet Cortés never\r\nrelaxed his caution, and in order to keep him under safe surveillance\r\nAntonio de Villareal was appointed his tutor, and Bachiller Escobar\r\ncaptain of Tezcuco, while Pedro Sanchez Farfan and his brave wife\r\nMaría de Estrada also remained there. This recognition of an esteemed\r\ndescendant of the beloved Nezahualpilli, and the just and moderate\r\nconduct of the Spaniards, served to reconcile the people, who speedily\r\nreturned to their homes and avocations. The caciques of Coatlichan,\r\nHuexotla, and Atenco tendered allegiance within three days of the\r\nSpanish entry, protesting that their hostility had been wholly\r\ncompulsory.\r\n\r\nThis ready submission was by no means palatable to Quauhtemotzin, who\r\nsent messengers to stir anew the spirit of revolt, while preparing to\r\nstrike a blow. But the emissaries were promptly surrendered to the\r\nSpaniards, before whom they pretended to be merely peace mediators.\r\nIt pleased Cortés to accept the explanation, and after treating the\r\ncaptives with great kindness he sent them back to Mexico to carry\r\npeace proposals. Those who had been the chief promoters of the late\r\nuprising were now dead, and it was better the past should be forgotten,\r\nand friendship established. To this no answer was vouchsafed.\r\n\r\nNo hostile demonstration having occurred for eight days after the entry\r\ninto Tezcuco, Cortés resolved to waste no further time in preparation,\r\nbut to begin the campaign. This course was also needed to maintain\r\nthe troops in activity, to encourage them with spoils, and to save\r\nthe friendly Tezcucans from the constant drain of providing supplies.\r\nAmong the intended head-quarters during the siege of Mexico to follow\r\nwas the rich and beautiful garden city of Iztapalapan, close to the\r\nsouthern entrance of the capital. This was an advantageous point,\r\nthrough which a blow might be dealt the Mexicans while chastising\r\nthe town itself for the hostility of its inhabitants and their late\r\nruler, Cuitlahuatzin, the brother and successor of Montezuma. The\r\nexpedition consisted of eighteen horse and two hundred foot, with\r\na few thousand Tlascaltecs and Tezcucans,[1043] headed by Cortés,\r\nSandoval remaining in charge of the camp.\r\n\r\nWarned by the movement, the inhabitants began to remove their families\r\nand valuables, while the warriors marched along the lake shore for\r\nnearly two leagues to meet and detain the invaders, supported by\r\nAztec forces and a fleet of canoes. As soon as the Spaniards came\r\nup a lively skirmish ensued, the warriors being obliged to retreat,\r\nthough slowly, rallying at times, when the nature of the ground\r\npermitted.[1044] Three hours of fighting brought them near the town,\r\nand a final assault by the soldiers effected an entrance and forced\r\nthe warriors to take refuge in canoes and houses. The first comers\r\noccupied the upper quarters, the others continued their course toward\r\nthe lake, where the dwellings stood on piles, cutting down every person\r\nencountered in the streets. General massacre was followed by pillage,\r\nand before nightfall six thousand bodies were ready for the funeral\r\npyre.[1045] Suddenly midst the work of destruction Cortés observed\r\nstartling signs of increasing waters, and soon after a Tezcucan brought\r\nword that the dike shielding the town on the west had been cut. In\r\ntheir desperation the inhabitants had invoked the flood, whose mercy\r\ncould not be more pitiless than the invaders, while it might assist\r\nthe work of revenge.[1046]\r\n\r\nThe opening was widening every moment. No time was to be lost. The\r\nrecall was sounded, but with the people so scattered it took some time\r\nto gather them. Staggering under the weight of spoil they fell into\r\nline, their march being dimly lighted by the flames behind them. The\r\nflood increased so much that few of them could retain their burdens,\r\nand near the opening the water came with such force as to make the\r\npassage difficult. Several of the allies were swept away. It was nine\r\no’clock before the last of the troops gained the high land beyond\r\nthe dike. “A delay of three hours longer, and none of us would have\r\nescaped,” writes Cortés. Failing in their desperate sacrifice to\r\ncatch the invaders in the flooded houses, there to be imprisoned all\r\nnight by the rushing waters, the enemy were at hand in canoes with\r\nearly dawn, showering missiles and sallying against the flanks of\r\nthe invaders. The Spaniards could only reply with sword and lance,\r\nfor the powder was wet, and since nothing more could be done under\r\nthe circumstances, they continued the retreat to Tezcuco. A number\r\nof allies fell, and even the soldiers, who had suffered no casualties\r\nin the capture of Iztapalapan, now lost one out of their ranks.[1047]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the loss of booty and the humiliating retreat, the\r\nexpedition had succeeded in its main object, to inflict a severe lesson\r\non the foe by desolating one of the finest cities in the valley, at\r\nthe very threshold of the capital. The effect was noticed in the\r\narrival, the day after the return to Tezcuco, of messengers from\r\nOtumba and several adjacent towns,[1048] penitently to renew their\r\nallegiance, which was never again broken. A number of other towns\r\nand domains followed the example, notably Chalco, a large and fertile\r\ndistrict extending round Chalco Lake, and toward the south-eastward.\r\nIt had fallen from the rank of an independent kingdom to that of a\r\nprovince tributary to the Aztecs. The severity of its taskmasters\r\nkept ever smouldering the flame of revolt, and deeply the people\r\nsighed for deliverance. Owing to the proximity of the Mexicans and\r\nthe presence of their lawless garrisons, they like many others had\r\nnot before ventured to cast off the yoke, but with the approach of\r\nthe Spaniards they gathered courage, and two envoys were sent to\r\nimplore protection.[1049]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis accorded with Cortés’ plans, and Sandoval was instructed to\r\nassist them. His first order, however, was to escort to Tlascala with\r\ntwenty horsemen and two hundred infantry the carriers, together with\r\na number of warriors, who desired to return home with the booty so\r\nfar acquired. Fresh supplies were likewise desired, and communication\r\nwith Villa Rica must be kept open. They had not proceeded far before\r\nthe Tlascaltecs, who had hastened in advance of the Spanish main\r\nbody, found themselves attacked by a large force, which slew a number\r\nand captured the carriers’ train. Sandoval routed the assailants and\r\nrecaptured most of the booty.[1050]\r\n\r\nFrom Tlascala Sandoval turned to Chalco. In certain maizefields in\r\nfront of the capital the Mexicans stood prepared with twelve thousand\r\nwarriors to dispute possession. He charged them at the head of his\r\ncavalry, but, though yielding for a moment, they rallied and with\r\ntheir long pikes compelled him to fall back upon the infantry and\r\nallies. The second charge was more successful, and within two hours\r\nthe foe was in flight, during which large numbers were slaughtered\r\nand some captives taken, including three leading men, while but few\r\nof the Spaniards were even wounded.\r\n\r\nThe Chalcans came forth to tender an ovation, and the two young rulers\r\nAcazitzin and Omacatzin[1051] accompanied the troops to personally\r\noffer allegiance to Cortés, together with some small presents. Their\r\nfather had always admired the Spaniards and sought to serve them,[1052]\r\nand on his death-bed, during the late small-pox epidemic, he had\r\nrecommended them and their counsellors to submit to the white chief,\r\nfor to him and his children of the sun did prophecy point as rulers\r\nof that land. So important an accession gave no little pleasure to\r\nCortés, who treated the young prisoners with every consideration. At\r\ntheir own request he confirmed them in the lordship, assigning to the\r\neldest Chalco city, with more than half the towns in the province,\r\nwhile the younger received Tlalmanalco and Chimalhuacan, with Ayotzinco\r\nand other places subject to them.[1053]\r\n\r\nThe eight captives were kindly treated, and sent to Mexico with\r\npeace proposals similar to those transmitted by the former captors;\r\nbut there came no reply. The secession of Chalco was a blow to the\r\nMexicans even more severe than the capture of Iztapalapan, owing to the\r\nbad example to submissive and wavering provinces, and Quauhtemotzin\r\nhastened with allurements and threats to reimpress upon them the\r\nnecessity for remaining true to the empire. These messages were also\r\nsent to the towns round Tezcuco; and the caciques of Coatlichan and\r\nHuexotla came to the Spanish camp in great distress, to say that all\r\nMexico was coming upon them. They were doubtful whether to flee to\r\nthe mountains or come to Tezcuco. They were reassured and promised\r\nsuccor when required; meanwhile they must entrench themselves and\r\nprepare the warriors. The Mexicans did little, however, beyond making\r\nraids on farms and stragglers from two towns,[1054] wherein they were\r\nentrenched, not far from Tezcuco. This attack on the larder of the\r\narmy could not be endured, and Cortés went forth on two occasions\r\nto secure the threatened crops for himself, driving off a force of\r\nmarauders who had come with quite a fleet in the expectation of a\r\nfine harvest, and capturing their strongholds on the lake.[1055]\r\n\r\nAll this made communication with Tlascala insecure, and on last leaving\r\nthat province Sandoval had strictly forbidden any one to cross to\r\nTezcuco without a permit. It so happened that a vessel arrived at\r\nVilla Rica with over thirty soldiers, besides the crew, eight horses,\r\nand a quantity of war stores. Knowing how pleased Cortés would be,\r\na young soldier broke the rules, adventured his life, and carried\r\nthe tidings to the general, who freely forgave the disobedience of\r\norders. This young cavalier also reported that the brigantines were\r\ncompleted and ready for transport. Since siege operations could not\r\nbegin until the brigantines were floated on Tezcuco Lake, no time\r\nwas to be lost, and Sandoval received orders to proceed at once to\r\nTlascala and convoy the precious train. In going he must pass through\r\nZoltepec, five leagues distant, near the eastern border of Acolhuacan,\r\nand there inflict chastisement for the murder of the Yuste party\r\nduring the late uprising.\r\n\r\nSandoval set out with fifteen horse and two hundred foot. On the way\r\na house was passed bearing upon its wall the touching inscription,\r\n“Herein the unhappy Juan Yuste was a prisoner.” The inhabitants\r\nof Zoltepec, henceforth termed ‘pueblo Morisco,’ had long expected\r\nthis descent, and no sooner did the party appear in sight than they\r\nhastened to the mountains. One body of soldiers entered the town to\r\nplunder, and found among other things relics of the dress, arms, and\r\naccoutrements of their slain comrades in one of the temples.[1056]\r\nAnother body pursued the fugitives, killing a few and capturing a\r\nlarge number, chiefly women, who were enslaved. Their pleading so\r\nmoved the heart of Sandoval that he issued a pardon to those who had\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Martin Lopez, the master shipwright in Tlascala, had arranged\r\nfor the transportation of the brigantines. A trial launch had been\r\nmade of one or two above a dam thrown across Zahuatl River,[1057] and\r\nthis proving satisfactory they were broken up. Upon the shoulders of\r\neight thousand carriers were now loaded the separate pieces of timber\r\nand planks, duly marked and numbered for fitting them together; also\r\nthe spars, cordage, sails, together with a quantity of ammunition, two\r\nheavy guns, and other effects.[1058] Gayly they bent to the burden\r\nwherein lay enginery so portentous for the destruction of the hated\r\nAztecs. The caravan set forth, escorted by a large force of warriors,\r\nand halted at Hueyotlipan to await the Spanish convoy. After a time the\r\nTlascaltecs became impatient, and regardless of warnings proceeded.\r\nWhile encamped near the border an alarm was raised, and tumultuously\r\nthe warriors rushed to arms to protect a portion at least of the train\r\nwhich had cost such labor and embodied such hopes. The next moment\r\na cheer was heard. It was Sandoval and his men.\r\n\r\nWith this new protection many of the Tlascaltec escort could be\r\ndismissed, and the remaining twenty thousand were redistributed,\r\nthe rear being assigned to the leading chief, Chichimecatl, and the\r\nflanks to Axotecatl and Teotepil.[1059]\r\n\r\nIt was a strange sight in those parts, this serpentine procession as\r\nit wound its way across the Tezcucan border, along the narrow defiles\r\nof the mountains,[1060] extending two miles from front to rear, it\r\nis said. A fleet impelled by human agencies over mountain and plain,\r\nthrough forest and dale, it was indeed a “cosa maravillosa,” as Cortés\r\nexpresses it. The feat of Vasco Nuñez stood repeated, but magnified\r\nin some respects, in the number of the vessels, in the distance of\r\nthe journey, the lurking foe being ever present, and in the audacity\r\nof purpose, the subjugation of the proudest metropolis on all this\r\nvast continent. And great was the rejoicing at Tezcuco as the caravan\r\ncame in sight on the fourth day, arrayed in gala attire, with brightly\r\ngleaming devices and ornaments, and waving plumage, advancing in one\r\nlong line to inspiring music. With a large retinue, also in gala dress,\r\nCortés went forth to meet them, and as the procession passed into\r\nthe city the Tlascaltecs rolled forth their newly acquired Spanish\r\nvivas: “Viva el Emperador!” “Viva Malinche!” “Castilla!” “Tlascala,\r\nTlascala, Castilla!” The march past occupied six hours, says Cortés.\r\nShip-yards were prepared for the vessels on the border of a creek or\r\nirrigation canal, which had been deepened and widened for nearly half\r\na league, fortified in places with timber and masonry, and provided\r\nwith dams and locks. This labor had occupied eight thousand Tezcucans\r\nfifty days.[1061]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [1013] Many favored Ayotzinco, near Chalco, which offered\r\n     also a good launching place for the vessels. _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 118.\r\n\r\n     [1014] Where now is the chapel of San Buenaventura.\r\n     _Camargo_, _Hist. Tlax._, 176. Yet Lorenzana says: ‘Por\r\n     constante tradicion se trabajó en un Barrio de Hueyothlipan,\r\n     que llaman Quausimalán, que quiere decir, donde labran\r\n     los Palos.’ _Cortés_, _Hist. N. Esp._, 167. But it is more\r\n     likely to have been on the river passing through Tlascala\r\n     city, and near Matlalcueye Mount.\r\n\r\n     [1015] The timber came probably from the Matlalcueye slopes;\r\n     the masts from Hueyotlipan; the pitch from the pine woods\r\n     near Huexotzinco, says Bernal Diaz, where it was prepared\r\n     by four sailors, for the natives did not understand its\r\n     manufacture. ‘Es la Sierra Matlalcuie,’ states Torquemada,\r\n     _Monarq. Ind._, i. 524. ‘La brea se saca de ... la sierra\r\n     de la Agua de Xalapa,’ near San Juan de los Llanos.\r\n     _Bustamante_, in _Chimalpain_, _Hist. Conq._, ii. 13.\r\n     This applies rather to colonial times. Bernal Diaz, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 118, 124, names a number of those who aided in\r\n     building. See also _Mora_, in _Soc. Mex. Geog._, _Boletin_,\r\n     x. 302-3.\r\n\r\n     [1016] Bernal Diaz names several of the thirteen soldiers.\r\n     The captain was Francisco Medel. One of the men, Monjaraz,\r\n     was said to have murdered his wife. He kept aloof from all\r\n     combat, but once he ascended a tower to look on, and was\r\n     that same day killed by Indians. _Hist. Verdad._, 118-19.\r\n\r\n     [1017] Such are in substance the famous regulations of\r\n     Cortés. The document was witnessed on the 22d of December\r\n     by the leading officers, before Juan de Ribera, ‘notary\r\n     public in all the kingdoms of Spain,’ and was publicly read\r\n     at the review of the troops, the 26th, by Anton García,\r\n     crier. The full text has been reproduced in _Icazbalceta_,\r\n     _Col. Doc._, i. 445-51, and _Cortés_, _Escritos Sueltos_,\r\n     13-23, owing to the defects of the copy by Prescott, and\r\n     the briefness and blunders of earlier references to it.\r\n\r\n     [1018] ‘Quedò tal, que no boluio en si, ni pudo tragar en\r\n     vn mes.’ _Herrera_, dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xx. One soldier\r\n     was lashed for imposing on an Indian, and another degraded.\r\n\r\n     [1019] This is Cortés’ own account, with the exception that\r\n     he gives the field-pieces as eight or nine. _Cartas_, 165.\r\n     Gomara says 540 infantry and nine guns. _Hist. Mex._, 174.\r\n     Vetancurt writes six guns, which may be a misprint. _Teatro\r\n     Mex._, pt. iii. 150.\r\n\r\n     [1020] ‘Anqueras,’ as Spaniards call the covering, are\r\n     still in use by rich horsemen in Mexico, highly ornamented.\r\n\r\n     [1021] Thompson describes the armor of Alvarado at the\r\n     Mexico museum. It indicates that this renowned cavalier was\r\n     a smaller man than Cortés, whom he supposes to have been\r\n     of Napoleon’s size. _Recol. Mex._, 119.\r\n\r\n     [1022] In _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 165-6, are given the main\r\n     points of the speech, too brief evidently for Gomara,\r\n     who fabricates a verbose spiritless oration according to\r\n     his fancy, _Hist. Mex._, 174-5, while shorter versions\r\n     are presented by Ixtlilxochitl, Oviedo, Torquemada, and\r\n     Clavigero.\r\n\r\n     [1023] See _Native Races_, ii. 405-12, for description of\r\n     arms, banners, etc.\r\n\r\n     [1024] Herrera, who objects to Ojeda’s large figure, gives\r\n     60,000 archers, 40,000 shieldmen, and 10,000 pikemen, dec.\r\n     ii. lib. x. cap. xx., and this Vetancurt accepts, _Teatro\r\n     Mex._, pt. iii. 150, while Solis reduces the men at the\r\n     review to 10,000, though he allows over 60,000 to join the\r\n     march the following day. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 287-8.\r\n\r\n     [1025] If any there were who followed not of their free-will\r\n     they should remain behind. He had enough men as it was.\r\n     The lords replied that they would rather be drowned in the\r\n     lake than return without victory. _Torquemada_, i. 526. On\r\n     this occasion may have been presented to the Tlascaltec\r\n     battalion the red damask banner, bearing on one side the\r\n     crowned image of the virgin with the hands uplifted in\r\n     prayer, and on the other the royal arms of Castile and\r\n     Leon, a banner which Boturini obtained possession of with\r\n     proofs of its genuineness. _Catálogo_, 75. Yet this design\r\n     appears to belong to a standard borne by the Spaniards on\r\n     entering the conquered Mexico.\r\n\r\n     [1026] The chief motive for restricting the number was,\r\n     according to Gomara, the trouble of sustaining them. _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 176. Bernal Diaz mentions only 10,000 warriors,\r\n     wherein he evidently does not include carriers. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 119. Herrera increases the number to 80,000,\r\n     under four captains, directed to a certain extent by Ojeda\r\n     and Juan Marquez. dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xx.\r\n\r\n     [1027] ‘Acordé de entrar por esta de Tezmoluca, porque ...\r\n     el puerto dél era mas agro y fragoso.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     167. Yet Lorenzana adds a note of explanation which shows\r\n     that he misunderstands the text. Ixtlilxochitl calls the\r\n     road Tlepehuacan. _Hist. Chich._, 306. Through the Rio Frio\r\n     Mountains. _Chimalpain_, _Hist. Conq._, ii. 19. The present\r\n     improved road from Vera Cruz to Mexico. _Orozco y Berra_,\r\n     in _Noticias Mex._, 255.\r\n\r\n     [1028] ‘Lugar de Enzinas.’ _Herrera_, loc. cit. Now San\r\n     Martin Tezmeluca. _Bustamante_, in _Chimalpain_, ubi sup.\r\n\r\n     [1029] Herrera leaves the impression that a new road was\r\n     now opened to escape the entrenchments and traps already\r\n     formed by the enemy. But he is evidently wrong.\r\n\r\n     [1030] ‘Prometimos todos de nunca dellas salir sin victoria,\r\n     ó déjar allí las vidas.’ _Cartas_, 169. ‘We vowed, if God\r\n     gave success, to act better in besieging the city.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 119.\r\n\r\n     [1031] Herrera calls them 100,000; Vetancurt, 140,000.\r\n\r\n     [1032] At Tlepehuacan, near the border. _Ixtlilxochitl_,\r\n     _Hist. Chich._, 306-7.\r\n\r\n     [1033] Ixtlilxochitl calls him in one place the brother of\r\n     Cohuanacoch. _Id._, 299.\r\n\r\n     [1034] ‘As a spy,’ adds Cortés, _Cartas_, 176. Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     states, contrary to Cortés, that this general sent him to\r\n     Tezcuco on the same errand as the previous envoy. _Hist.\r\n     Chich._, 306. But this appears a needless exposure of an\r\n     important personage.\r\n\r\n     [1035] Bernal Diaz states that Cortés nevertheless embraced\r\n     the envoys, three of whom were relatives of Montezuma.\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 120.\r\n\r\n     [1036] _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 214.\r\n\r\n     [1037] Prescott says Nezahualpilli’s, but this was burned\r\n     at this very time according to the only authority on the\r\n     point, Ixtlilxochitl, _Hor. Crueldades_, 10. Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg assumes that the allies stayed at Huexotla, which\r\n     is doubtful. _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 402.\r\n\r\n     [1038] The stuffed skins of the five horses were found,\r\n     and other things, offered to the idol. _Cortés_, _Cartas_,\r\n     183. Strange that the Tezcucans should not have removed so\r\n     palpable evidence against them.\r\n\r\n     [1039] _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 306.\r\n\r\n     [1040] _Real Cédula, 1551._ In this cédula are named a number\r\n     of the brothers, but the pagan name is not given in every\r\n     instance. Bernal Diaz and Torquemada confirm this baptismal\r\n     name for the ruler now appointed; Cortés writes merely\r\n     Fernando; Ixtlilxochitl adds Tecocoltzin; Sahagun gives the\r\n     latter name and calls him legitimate, as he was in a certain\r\n     sense. _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 143. Clavigero calls him\r\n     Fernando Cortés Ixtlilxochitl; Chimalpain interpolates De\r\n     Alvarado in lieu of Cortés, but substitutes Tecocoltzin for\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl in one place. _Hist. Conq._, 21, 55. Vetancurt\r\n     evidently accepts the true name, but applies the baptism and\r\n     appointment to Ixtlilxochitl. _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 152.\r\n     The latter, who succeeded to the Tezcucan rulership toward\r\n     the end of 1521, received the name of Fernando Pimentel,\r\n     and it is this similarity of the first name that has led to\r\n     the pretty general confusion about the appointee. Lockhart\r\n     actually attempts to rectify the correct statement of Bernal\r\n     Diaz with a blunder, _Memoirs_, ii. 411; and Zamacois, in\r\n     doing the same with the blundering Solis, gives a long note\r\n     amusingly erroneous. _Hist. Méj._, iii. 585.\r\n\r\n     [1041] Ixtlilxochitl states not wrongly that Tecocoltzin\r\n     was chosen by general request, but he adds that while the\r\n     political horizon was so cloudy the electors preferred\r\n     that a legitimate heir like Ixtlilxochitl should not fill\r\n     so dangerous a position; nor did the latter care to rule\r\n     while the elder brother lived. _Hist. Chich._, 307; _Hor.\r\n     Crueldades_, 11-13. Pretty good excuse for a prince who\r\n     forcibly wrested half the domain from Cacama. Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg assumes that he feared to be suspected of seeking\r\n     a Spanish alliance merely to obtain the crown. _Hist. Nat.\r\n     Civ._, iv. 409. But this design he had long harbored, as\r\n     even the abbé intimates at times. He no doubt stood, with\r\n     his strong character, as one of the powers behind the throne.\r\n     Cohuanacoch does not appear to have had much influence.\r\n\r\n     [1042] Solis takes this opportunity to elaborate a few\r\n     of his specimen speeches. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 315-16. ‘Fue\r\n     el primero que en publico en Tezcuco se casò, y velò.’\r\n     _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 152.\r\n\r\n     [1043] Bernal Diaz differs somewhat, and gives the proportion\r\n     of forces, attended also by Alvarado and Olid. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 121. The Tlascaltecs numbered about 4000, and\r\n     the Tezcucans, according to Ixtlilxochitl, from 4000 to 6000.\r\n\r\n     [1044] Gomara assumes that they sought to allure the\r\n     Spaniards into the town. _Hist. Mex._, 179.\r\n\r\n     [1045] So estimated by Cortés and others. Herrera reduces\r\n     it to 5000.\r\n\r\n     [1046] Cortés states that he saw men cutting the dike as\r\n     he entered the town, but did not consider the significance\r\n     until the water rose and recalled it to him. _Cartas_, 174.\r\n\r\n     [1047] So says Cortés, while Bernal Diaz assumes that two\r\n     men and one horse were lost, he himself receiving so severe\r\n     a wound in the throat as to become an invalid for some\r\n     time. _Hist. Verdad._, 121. Solis refers to the affair as\r\n     a glorious victory.\r\n\r\n     [1048] Four, says Cortés, and Lorenzana enumerates several\r\n     which may have embraced them. _Hist. N. Esp._, 196. Brasseur\r\n     de Bourbourg confounds some with southern Chalco towns.\r\n\r\n     [1049] Duran states that the Chalcans had sent presents\r\n     with offers of alliance before the Spaniards crossed the\r\n     mountain border. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 491. But this is\r\n     doubtful. Ixtlilxochitl assumes that they appealed first to\r\n     his namesake, as their suzerain, and he advised submission\r\n     to Cortés. Mizquic and Cuitlahuac appear to have joined in\r\n     the submission.\r\n\r\n     [1050] Bernal Diaz writes that two archers fell and seven\r\n     of the foe. Owing to this incident Sandoval left orders\r\n     that no reënforcements from Villa Rica should advance\r\n     beyond Tlascala till further orders. _Hist. Verdad._, 122.\r\n     Prescott wrongly assumes that this attack occurred on the\r\n     march to Chalco.\r\n\r\n     [1051] Ixtlilxochitl, _Hist. Chich._ 314. On another\r\n     page, 307, he names Omacatzin and four other caciques, and\r\n     Chimalpain, several others, _Hist. Conq._, 36-7; but they\r\n     appear nearly all to be sub-caciques. Brasseur de Bourbourg\r\n     calls the first lord Itzcahuatzin.\r\n\r\n     [1052] He had served the Spaniards during the late uprising.\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 178-9.\r\n\r\n     [1053] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 123; _Clavigero_,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 174. After taking them back to Chalco,\r\n     Sandoval escorted from Tlascala some Spaniards and Don\r\n     Fernando, the new ruler of Tezcuco.\r\n\r\n     [1054] Chimalpain names Chimalhuacàn, Chitlahuaca, and\r\n     Chicoaloapan. _Hist. Conq._, ii. 24.\r\n\r\n     [1055] Some of the raided fields were Mexico temple\r\n     properties. One Spaniard was killed and twelve wounded,\r\n     while the Mexicans lost over a dozen, besides a number\r\n     of prisoners. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 122-3. The\r\n     caciques of the captured strongholds came now to submit. The\r\n     Aztecs recaptured them, and had again to be driven forth.\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 180-1; _Torquemada_, i. 529.\r\n\r\n     [1056] ‘Dos caras que auian desollado ... quatro cueros de\r\n     cauallos curtidos ... muchos vestidos de los Españoles q̄\r\n     auiã muerto.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 124.\r\n\r\n     [1057] Herrera, dec. iii. lib. i. cap. v., intimates that\r\n     all were launched, as do Camargo, Prescott, and others, but\r\n     Torquemada observes that it would have been needless injury\r\n     to the timbers to put all together. Besides, all were made\r\n     on one or two models, the different pieces being shaped in\r\n     exact imitation of those for the models.\r\n\r\n     [1058] Ojeda, who appears to have rendered great service\r\n     as interpreter and in controlling the Tlascaltecs, was\r\n     soon after rewarded with what he terms a generalship over\r\n     all the auxiliaries under Cortés. Herrera makes a special\r\n     later expedition of 5000 Tlascaltecs convey the guns and\r\n     other effects, carried in wooden beds by relays of twenty\r\n     natives for each. dec. iii. lib. i. cap. vi.\r\n\r\n     [1059] The names are written in different ways by different\r\n     authors. The former is probably identical with the chief\r\n     of Atlihuetzian, who afterward killed his two sons for\r\n     becoming Christians, says Clavigero, _Storia Mess._, iii.\r\n     176. Chimalpain calls them brothers. _Hist. Conq._, ii. 26.\r\n     Camargo, followed by Herrera, assumes that the original\r\n     native force was 180,000. Gomara and Ixtlilxochitl allow\r\n     20,000 to have been retained, besides carriers; others give\r\n     each of the chiefs 10,000 men, while Bernal Diaz, who as a\r\n     rule seeks to ignore the value of native aid, reduces the\r\n     number to 8000 warriors and 2000 carriers. Chichimecatl\r\n     became quite indignant at finding himself removed from\r\n     the van. He was a lord of Tlascala, and had ever been\r\n     accustomed to posts of honor and danger. ‘For this very\r\n     reason,’ replied Sandoval, ‘have I placed you in the rear,\r\n     for there the foe will be most likely to attack.’ Though\r\n     mollified in the main, Chichimecatl still grumbled, and\r\n     considered his army sufficient to guard the rear without\r\n     the aid of the Spanish force attached to his. Sandoval\r\n     no doubt took the van, though Bernal Diaz states that he\r\n     joined the rear. _Hist. Verdad._, 124. Cortés implies that\r\n     the change was owing to the risk, in case of attack, to\r\n     have in the van the cumbersome timber under Chichimecatl’s\r\n     care. _Cartas_, 184-5. Chimalpain supposes that the chief\r\n     carried his points. _Hist. Conq._, ii. 27.\r\n\r\n     [1060] North of Telapon, as the easiest route, is the\r\n     supposition of Orozco y Berra, in _Noticias Mex._, 256.\r\n\r\n     [1061] ‘Hizieronla quatro cientos mil hombres.’ _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 191. That is, 8000 fresh men daily for 50\r\n     days, to judge by the figure. Ixtlilxochitl fails not to\r\n     adopt a number which speaks so well for the size of his\r\n     province. _Hist. Chich._, 307; _Relaciones_, 416. ‘La\r\n     zanja tenia mas de dos estados de hondura y otros tantos\r\n     de anchura, y iba toda chapada y estacada.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 206. Bustamante claims to have seen traces of\r\n     it, _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, 66-7, as did Lorenzana in his\r\n     time. _Cortés_, _Hist. N. Esp._, 234. For the caulking of\r\n     the vessels cotton was also used, and for want of grease,\r\n     human fat was obtained from slain enemies, writes Gomara.\r\n     Oidor Zuazo was assured of this pagan consecration for the\r\n     fleet. This has been denied by others, observes Oviedo,\r\n     iii. 423-4; but there is nothing improbable in a partial\r\n     use thereof, for human fat had been frequently used in other\r\n     cases, as Cortés admits. Additional timber was obtained in\r\n     Tolantzinco, says Ixtlilxochitl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY CAMPAIGNS.\r\n\r\nMARCH-MAY, 1521.\r\n\r\n     PLAN FOR THE INVESTMENT OF MEXICO—RECONNOITRING TOUR ROUND\r\n     THE LAKE—CORTÉS IN COMMAND—ALVARADO AND OLID ACCOMPANY—THEY\r\n     PROCEED NORTHWARD FROM TEZCUCO—CAPTURE OF CITIES AND\r\n     STRONGHOLDS—XALTOCAN, QUAUHTITLAN, TENAYOCAN, AZCAPUZALCO,\r\n     TLACOPAN, AND BACK TO TEZCUCO—CHALCO DISTURBED—PEACE\r\n     PROPOSALS SENT TO MEXICO—FURTHER RECONNOISSANCE OF THE\r\n     LAKE REGION—MANY BATTLES AND VICTORIES—QUAUHNAHUAC\r\n     CAPTURED—BURNING OF XOCHIMILCO—SECOND RETURN TO\r\n     TEZCUCO—CONSPIRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrival at Tezcuco of the brigantines recalled the necessity for\r\nplanning the investment of Mexico, and this involved a reconnoitring\r\ntour round the lake, for which the Tlascaltecs in particular were\r\nimportunate. Chichimecatl pressed this measure the moment he arrived\r\nat Tezcuco. He had come to serve the emperor, to join the Spaniards\r\nin avenging their fallen countrymen. Cortés expressed appreciation\r\nof his zeal, “but rest now,” he said, “for soon you shall have your\r\nhands full.” A few days later the general set out from Tezcuco\r\nwith twenty-five horse, three hundred foot-soldiers, twenty-five\r\narchers and crossbowmen, and over thirty thousand allies, chiefly\r\nTlascaltecs, with a number of Tezcucans. Among the war material were\r\nsix field-pieces.[1062] Alvarado and Olid accompanied the expedition,\r\nand also a number of the Tezcucan leaders, partly as hostages, while\r\nSandoval remained in charge. A northward course was taken, though the\r\naim and destination were divulged to but a few, owing to the distrust\r\nstill entertained of the Tezcucans.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE VALLEY OF MEXICO.]\r\n\r\nOn the Tecama Plain, four miles from Tezcuco, a hostile force\r\napproached, probably by accident. After routing them the army encamped.\r\nThe following day they proceeded to Xaltocan,[1063] a prominent town\r\nsituated on an island in the northern end of the lake bearing that\r\nname. Once the capital successively of a Toltec, Otomí, and Chichimec\r\nprincipality, it had succumbed to the vicissitudes of political\r\nrevolution and wars, and was at present one of the chief strongholds\r\nbelonging to the tripartite power in the valley. It was approached\r\nby a causeway provided with breastworks and drawbridges.\r\n\r\nThe intention of the army had been surmised, so that preparations were\r\nmade in every direction to resist an entry, and the water swarmed\r\nwith canoes. In advancing along the causeway a tempest of stones,\r\narrows, and darts came upon them from both sides, while hampered on a\r\nnarrow road, hemmed in by the waters, and able to do little against\r\nthe floating enemy, who were comparatively safe behind the bulwarks\r\nfitted to their canoes. Advance was soon stopped by the first trench\r\nin the causeway, not only wide and deep, but protected on the farther\r\nside by strong breastworks. The situation was embarrassing. Falling\r\nback a little, with the loss of one man, the guns were brought forward\r\nto protect the allies while filling the gap; but at this juncture\r\ntwo Tezcucans informed Cortés that they could guide him across by a\r\nfordable passage.\r\n\r\nThe offer was eagerly accepted, and while a part of the forces\r\nattracted the foe to the causeway, and the horses covered the rear,\r\nCortés led another party by the ford. The water reached only to the\r\nwaist, and though the enemy hastened forward, resistance was in vain,\r\nand soon the town was reached, and all who had not escaped immediately\r\nsurrendered. Good spoils were secured of fabrics and other merchandise,\r\nas well as some gold. Since the canoe fleet might attempt a night\r\nattack, it was not considered safe to camp on the island, and as the\r\narmy withdrew to the plain one league beyond, a part of the town was\r\nfired, in further warning. Xaltocan had more than once before risen\r\nfrom her ashes, but these were the flames of her funeral pyre. She\r\nnever assumed importance again, and is now but a pretty village.\r\n\r\nThe next camp was formed in Quauhtitlan, “a large and beautiful city,”\r\nas Cortés calls it, which was found deserted. Thence they followed\r\nthe route which had been taken after that night of ineffaceable\r\nhorrors, when the foe seemed to fill the air and beat their faces in\r\nthe blackness like the birds of Avernus, cutting off the stragglers\r\nfaint with wounds and hunger, and sending terror to the hearts of\r\nthe bravest. Now they came in confident strength, yet again the foe\r\nhovered round, though only at a distance, along the safe hill slopes,\r\nwhile from the summits rose pillars of smoke to proclaim the coming\r\nof the avengers. They passed through Tenayocan, once the capital of\r\nthe Chichimec empire, and now renowned only for the immense serpent\r\nidols in its temple, from which the Spaniards called it El Pueblo\r\nde los Sierpes. Thence to Azcapuzalco, the former proud seat of the\r\nTepanec kings.[1064]\r\n\r\nNo resistance being offered at any of these towns, they were spared\r\nthe brand, whereat the disappointed sackers felt aggrieved. As\r\nthe army neared Tlacopan a large opposing body appeared, which was\r\nreinforced by warriors from the towns thereabout and from Mexico. The\r\nground being level, the cavalry easily broke through their lines, and\r\nthe infantry completed the rout, pursuing them into the city. After\r\nclearing the greater number of streets from foes, camp was formed in\r\nthe palace.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly any evidence of the late ravages to which Mexico and\r\nits approaches had been exposed during Spanish occupation, and Cortés\r\nsaw that it would be no easy matter to besiege such a stronghold, or\r\nseries of strongholds, as the massive buildings may be termed, held\r\nas they were by so obstinate a people as the Aztecs, with whom any\r\ntrifling or imaginary success seemed to efface the effect of continual\r\ndefeats.\r\n\r\nThe prospect was not encouraging, and as he looked at the causeway\r\nfull of those pitfalls which had defeated his high purposes, gloomy\r\nthoughts filled his breast. “Why so sad, your worship?” broke in\r\na cavalier.[1065] “Yours was not the fault, and never will you be\r\ncompared with heartless Nero.” “I am not thinking of that sorrow\r\nalone,” said Cortés, “but of the struggles yet required to achieve\r\nthe mastery. Still with God’s approval we will soon attempt it.”[1066]\r\n\r\nIn the morning hostile forces again appeared, only to be driven back,\r\nwhereupon the allies dispersed to sack and fire, with the determination\r\nto avenge the attack made upon them during the flight from Mexico.\r\n“And in this they used such diligence,” writes Cortés, “that even\r\nour quarters were endangered.” The general was nothing loath to see\r\nthe flames, for it suited his plans not only to chastise the people,\r\nbut to render the place less strong in view of later operation;\r\nfurthermore, it was no easy matter to restrain the Tlascaltecs. Next\r\nday the enemy came again in force, but this time they waited not to\r\nbe routed. They retired steadily to and along the causeway to Mexico,\r\ndrawing the Spaniards after them. It was the very spot where they\r\nhad suffered so severely the year before. Cortés had led the cavalry\r\nfar along the causeway and across one bridge, when the Mexicans with\r\ninspiring shouts and doubled force came rolling back on front and\r\nflank, from houses and lanes, thrusting with pikes and striking with\r\nswords, the roofs meanwhile swarming with slingers. Cortés quickly\r\nsounded retreat, and the troops retired, but the onslaught had been\r\ntremendous, and it required no small effort to stay themselves.\r\nAlmost every one was wounded, it is said, and several fatally. In\r\ncrossing the bridge Alférez Juan Volante was knocked into the water.\r\nSeveral canoe-men seized him, but he was a powerful fellow, and with\r\nthe strength of desperation he shook them off and sprang back to\r\nhis comrades with his banner. Cortés made repeated charges with the\r\nhorses to relieve the pressed foot-soldiers, till open ground was\r\ngained and the danger past.[1067]\r\n\r\nOn the following days the Mexicans sought to repeat their manœuvres,\r\nbut Cortés was more prudent, and covered his rear carefully as he\r\nadvanced. Observing this, the Mexicans tauntingly called out: “Enter,\r\nO brave ones, and fight! for to-day you will be masters of Mexico.\r\nEnter to feast, all is prepared!” And again: “You shall find no\r\nMontezuma now to do your bidding. Begone, therefore, to your own!”\r\nOthers confined themselves to insults directed against the Tlascaltecs.\r\n“Rogues,” they cried, “never would you thus dare to approach us but\r\nfor the Christians, whose concubines you are. But wait awhile; we\r\nshall eat you both with chile, for you are not fit to be slaves!” The\r\nTlascaltecs were not slow to answer: “Always have you fled before us\r\nlike treacherous cowards. We are the men, you the women. Never have\r\nyou entered our territory as we yours. The Castilians are not men\r\nbut gods, one of whom suffices to rout a thousand such as you!” This\r\nverbal skirmish led in several cases to challenges, the principals\r\nbeing accorded a free field wherein to settle their disputes; and\r\nsince they were generally men selected from both sides for their\r\nbravery, skill, and strength, the struggles were eagerly watched.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a solitary warrior of great stature stepped from a\r\ncanoe to the causeway, armed with sword and shield, and challenged any\r\nSpaniard to combat, for he desired to appease the gods with blood. The\r\nsoldiers gaped in astonishment at this rashness. “What, you hesitate,\r\nyou cowards!” he cried. The next instant a soldier named Gonzalo\r\nHernandez rushed upon him with sword and shield, whereupon he leaped\r\ninto the water, pursued by the soldier, who sought to despatch him.\r\nA number of canoes stole up, however, and Hernandez was seized by the\r\nwarriors. His comrades rushed to the rescue, and so beset the canoes\r\nas to kill a chief and bring their champion ashore.[1068] During one\r\nof the sallies Cortés reached the breach in the causeway where his\r\nmen had suffered so severely during the Sorrowful Night. The bridge\r\nwas down, and he appealed to the warriors on the other side: “Why so\r\nfoolishly court destruction? If there is a leader among you, let him\r\nappear, so that I may speak.” “Speak,” was the response, “we are all\r\nleaders here; leaders who shall make a banquet of thee and thine!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSix days had been spent at Tlacopan, and since nothing could be\r\nachieved, not even an interview with Quauhtemotzin, for which Cortés\r\nardently longed, he turned homeward. This abandonment of what the\r\nMexicans had probably regarded as the beginning of the siege created no\r\nsmall exultation among them, and eagerly they pursued the retreating\r\narmy, though repelled now and then with some punishment by the\r\ncavalry. The following day the pursuing forces had swelled to larger\r\nproportions, and were more daring than ever. Cortés accordingly ordered\r\nthe infantry to advance, while he, with twenty horses, divided into\r\nseveral parties and formed an ambuscade. No sooner had the unsuspecting\r\nMexicans reached the spot than the cavalry charged into their midst\r\nwith thundering war cries. The surprise, no less than the execution,\r\ncaused a panic, and the infantry hastened back to join in the usual\r\nchastisement. Molestation ceased.\r\n\r\nFrom Quauhtitlan the army proceeded by way of Acolman to Tezcuco.\r\nThe presence of so large a body of allies being considered for the\r\nmoment unnecessary, the greater number, elated with success and laden\r\nwith spoil, were dismissed to their homes, there to prepare for the\r\ngathering to follow the completion of the brigantines.[1069]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal from Tlacopan encouraged the Mexicans to attempt the\r\nrecovery of Chalco and to inflict chastisement for its secession. The\r\nplace was indeed most important to Mexico, since from its fertile\r\nplains came the largest supplies, now more than ever required. The\r\nthreat had been held over the Chalcans ever since their submission to\r\nCortés, and the two young lords had hardly returned from Tezcuco before\r\nthey sent messengers to implore aid. This occurred while Sandoval\r\nwas preparing to leave for Tlascala to convey the brigantines, and no\r\nfurther troops could therefore be detached without great risk, so that\r\nthe Chalcans were told to wait. As the messengers were leaving with\r\nthis cold comfort envoys arrived from Huexotzinco and Quauhquechollan.\r\nThey had seen the signal pillars of smoke of the hostile allies, and\r\nhad come to ask if they could be of service. The proposals came most\r\nopportunely.\r\n\r\nThe Huexotzincas and Quauhquechollans had long entertained a hatred\r\nof the Chalcans, as natives of an Aztec province against whose forces\r\nthey had often been arrayed, but Cortés represented the true state\r\nof affairs and convinced the respective envoys of the important\r\nservice they could render themselves and their new sovereign, to\r\nwhom all owed allegiance, by forgetting occurrences for which their\r\noppressors were to blame, and to combine for mutual aid. His arguments\r\nwere convincing, and both Huexotzinco and Quauhquechollan promised\r\nimmediately to support the Chalcans with a large force.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs do not appear to have gone much beyond threats until after\r\nthe Spanish retirement from Tlacopan, but two days after their return\r\nto Tezcuco, Chalcan messengers appeared with such supplications that\r\nSandoval was despatched to their aid with twenty horse, three hundred\r\ninfantry, and a force of allies,[1070] largely reinforced at Chalco\r\nby Huexotzincas, Quauhquechollans, and Chalcans. On arriving before\r\nChimalhuacan,[1071] he found the enemy drawn up in battle array in\r\nthree large divisions. A rush at the invaders was made. The cavalry\r\nmet them, breaking their ranks and throwing them into confusion.\r\nRetiring to more broken ground, where they were comparatively safe from\r\nthe horses, they rallied to face the infantry, but the well directed\r\nvolleys of fire-arms and cross-bows proved another surprise, which\r\nprepared the way for an effective charge from swordsmen and lancers.\r\nNow the retreat assumed more the form of a flight, the Spaniards\r\npursuing eagerly. During this operation Gonzalo Dominguez was thrown\r\nfrom his horse, which fell upon him, inflicting such injuries that he\r\ndied within a few days. In him the army lost one of its most dashing\r\nhorsemen, and the equal of any in daring.\r\n\r\nThe troops then retired to the town for the night. Next day they\r\nmarched to Huastepec, the objective point of the expedition, where\r\nfifteen thousand Mexicans, composed partly of the defeated forces,\r\nattacked them with such energy that five horses and a number of\r\nsoldiers were wounded. The Spaniards soon routed them, and chased the\r\nfleeing through the town, a number taking refuge in a stronghold. While\r\na portion of the troops, together with the Tlascaltecs, dispersed in\r\nquest of the rich spoil, and the cavalry were tending their horses,\r\nthe fugitive garrison stole back to the town and fought their way to\r\nthe stronghold near the square, where they took a stand behind some\r\nbreastworks. Their position was not long maintained, however, after\r\nthe troops had collected for the assault. The entire force of Mexicans\r\nwas then driven for over a league, with considerable slaughter.\r\nThe army now took up their quarters for two days in the palace. A\r\npeaceful summons was sent to the lord of the place, without meeting\r\nany response; another to Yacapichtla brought an insulting answer. The\r\ninsolence was due to the confidence of the garrison in its strength,\r\nsituated as it was on an almost inaccessible height.[1072] The Chalcans\r\nimplored Sandoval to capture the place and drive forth the occupants,\r\nwho would otherwise not fail to descend with fire and sword on their\r\nland. The proposition was by no means agreeable after so arduous a\r\nmarch and with so many wounded, including himself; but Sandoval never\r\nshrank from what he regarded duty, and soon he appeared before the\r\nfort to repeat his demands, only to hear taunts and jeers. The ascent\r\nwas steep, with few points affording cover, and when the Chalcans were\r\nurged to begin the attack for which they had pleaded they objected\r\nunless the Teules accompanied them. Sandoval unhesitatingly placed\r\nsome horsemen to guard the rear, and dismounting with Tápia the two\r\ntook their shields and swords and led the way, followed by a number\r\nof soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe garrison lustily plied their stones and darts, and despite the\r\nprotecting shields several were wounded, among them Tápia and Osma,\r\nwhile others were overthrown by the concussion and came tumbling\r\ndown. With cheering Santiagos the soldiers urged one another onward\r\nuntil even the Chalcans joined the assault. The first Spaniard had\r\nhardly reached the summit before the occupants attempted flight,\r\nonly to bring death upon them the quicker. Many were chased over the\r\ncliff, to fall into equally relentless hands below; others in their\r\nfear and despair cast themselves headlong from the height. So freely\r\nflowed blood, the soldiers say, that the creek at the foot of the\r\nfortress was stained sanguine, and so remained for an hour, repelling\r\nin horror the victors who approached it to quench their thirst.[1073]\r\nThe Chalcans being now content, Sandoval returned to Tezcuco with\r\nconsiderable spoils and a number of pretty slaves.\r\n\r\nInformed of the victorious advance of the Spaniards, Emperor\r\nQuauhtemotzin hastened to send reinforcements to his garrisons, and\r\nhardly had Sandoval tendered a report to his general before the alarmed\r\nChalcans sent messengers stating that a fleet of two thousand large\r\ncanoes with numerous warriors were descending upon them. Believing\r\nthat Sandoval must have been too hasty or negligent, Cortés without\r\ndeigning to listen to excuses ordered him to return immediately.\r\nMeanwhile the Chalcans, encouraged by the allies, had faced the\r\ninvaders bravely and routed them in a fierce battle, killing quite a\r\nnumber and capturing over twoscore warriors, among them the general\r\nand several chiefs.[1074] When Sandoval came up the fight was over,\r\nand the proud victors surrendered their captives, who were sent to\r\nTezcuco, the Spaniards following as soon as the danger appeared to\r\nbe over.\r\n\r\nAggrieved at the brusqueness of his commander, Sandoval sent in\r\nhis report without presenting himself; but Cortés had by this time\r\nrecognized the injustice of his treatment, and actuated by policy no\r\nless than by affection, he summoned his captain and frankly avowed\r\nhis haste, thus strengthening the friendship which ever after bound\r\nthem. The victories in Chalco left secure the entire region between\r\nVilla Rica and the Spanish lines, and communication was henceforth\r\nregularly maintained, permitting fresh supplies and war material to be\r\nbrought from a vessel which had recently reached the coast. A great\r\nevent was the arrival of three vessels with two hundred Spaniards,\r\neighty horses, and a full complement of arms, ammunition, and other\r\neffects, partly bought and partly enlisted by the agents whom Cortés\r\nhad despatched to the Islands during the previous autumn. Among the\r\nnew-comers were Julian de Alderete of Tordesillas, appointed royal\r\ntreasurer for New Spain, and the Franciscan Pedro Melgarejo de Urrea\r\nof Seville, bearing a supply of papal indulgences for the men who\r\nhad been engaged in the crusade. That the soldiers were conscious\r\nof frequent transgressions may be judged from the suggestive and not\r\nwholly reverential observation of Bernal Diaz, that “after patching\r\ntheir defects the friar returned to Spain within a few months, a rich\r\nman.”[1075]\r\n\r\nCortés was cheered by offers of submission and alliance, owing partly\r\nto the good offices of Tezcucans and other allies. Some came from\r\nplaces quite distant, such as Nautla and Tuzapan, on the coast north\r\nof Villa Rica, laden as usual with presents.[1076] Another pleasing\r\nevidence of still more devoted loyalty came not long after from the\r\nsouth, from the country of the valiant Chinantecs, of the long pikes.\r\nDuring the great uprising, when Spaniards in small or straggling\r\nparties had everywhere been slaughtered, this people faithfully\r\nprotected the two soldiers who happened to be with them, and were in\r\nreturn aided by their prowess and advice to achieve victories over\r\nadjoining tribes. One of these men, Captain Hernando de Barrientos,\r\nsent two natives in April with a letter to his countrymen imparting\r\nthe assurance that Chinantla and its six sub-towns were loyal.[1077]\r\n\r\nThe recent successes and the arrival of the two hundred men induced\r\nCortés once more to propose peace to Quauhtemotzin. To this end,\r\nduring passion week, he bade some of the captured nobles proceed to\r\nMexico with a letter as a symbol of their commission, and impress upon\r\ntheir master the superiority in arms and skill of the Spanish forces,\r\ntheir constant and large reinforcements, and their unvarying success\r\nin the field. They must point out the generous and humane treatment\r\nof the provinces which had submitted, and assure the Aztec leaders\r\nthat equal forgiveness would be accorded them. Refusal to return to\r\ntheir allegiance would lead to the destruction of themselves and their\r\ncity. Only two of the captives ventured to accept the commission,\r\nfor according to Aztec articles of war any noble who returned to\r\nhis country after having been captured by an enemy was doomed to\r\ndecapitation unless he had performed some extraordinary deed.[1078]\r\n\r\nNo answer came from Mexico, and it was afterward learned that the\r\nmessengers had suffered death. The Aztec ruler had not even given a\r\nthought to peace. He was watching his opponents, prepared to take\r\nadvantage of any neglect or relaxation in their effort. No sooner\r\nhad Sandoval been induced by peaceful appearances to retire from\r\nChalco than Aztec forces again prepared to invade the province. The\r\nChalcans had due warning, and close upon the heels of Sandoval came\r\ntwo messengers lamenting louder than ever, and exhibiting a painting\r\nwherein were named the many towns whose forces were coming upon them,\r\nfully fifty thousand strong. These constant menaces and movements\r\nwere exasperating, and Cortés resolved personally to inflict a lesson\r\nwhich might be lasting. At the same time he proposed to complete\r\nhis reconnoissance of the lake region and encourage his troops with\r\nspoils from hostile localities whereon the Aztecs yet relied for\r\nsupport.[1079]\r\n\r\nCortés selected thirty horse, three hundred infantry, a number\r\nof Tlascaltecs, and over twenty thousand Tezcucans, under Prince\r\nIxtlilxochitl, to which twice that number of other allies were added\r\non the way. A large proportion of archers and aquebusiers were taken,\r\ntogether with Alvarado, Olid, Alderete, Melgarejo, and others, while\r\nSandoval was left in charge of Tezcuco, with instructions to watch\r\nand promote the completion of the brigantines against which several\r\nincendiary attempts had been made.\r\n\r\nThe expedition left Friday, the 5th of April, and passed through\r\nChalco, Tlalmanalco, and Chimalhuacan,[1080] and crossing in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction into the Totolapan province, they entered\r\nthe hills which form the southern border of the Mexican valley.\r\nBy this time the forces had assumed proportions hardly inferior to\r\nthose of the Iztocan campaign, when over one hundred thousand moved\r\nagainst the foe. Highly picturesque was the spectacle of this army,\r\nits naked hordes of warriors relieved by plumage and glittering\r\niztli points which rose above the broad line of gaudy shields; its\r\nwhite adventurers in mail of cotton and metal, surmounted by bright\r\nhelmets, and armed knights on proudly stepping steeds: picturesque\r\nin particular as it wound in almost endless line along the rounded\r\nslopes of the cliffs, or climbed in clearly defined file across the\r\nhill-tops, only to descend again into gulches gloomy as their own\r\nsinister purpose.\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the invasion, the inhabitants had abandoned their valley\r\nhomes, and had sought refuge on the summits, whence they hurled\r\nmissiles at the passing lines. Little attention was paid these\r\nirregular bands, composed as they were to a great extent of women and\r\nchildren. On entering the Tlayacapan Valley, however, and observing\r\non the craggy sides of an almost perpendicular isolated rock, perched\r\nthere like an eagle’s nest, a place of refuge peopled with more\r\npretentious opposers, in a fit of insensate folly Cortés ordered\r\nthe place to be assailed. He seemed to think the honor of the army\r\ndemanded it, and was ready to stake the lives of valuable men on its\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nOrders were given to attack from three several sides, the steepest\r\nbeing assigned to Alférez Corral, a brave and spirited leader. Verdugo\r\nand Villafuerte were given another side, and Ircio and Monjaraz the\r\nthird. Each party consisted of about threescore men, and included\r\narchers and arquebusiers. At a given signal all rushed forward to the\r\nascent. Soon they were on hands and knees, crawling over projections\r\nand pulling themselves up by means of shrubs. All the while stones\r\nand darts rattled on helmet and breastplate; and huge rocks came\r\nrolling down upon them. In vain they sought shelter in crevices and\r\nunder crags; they must face the storm. Bernal Diaz followed Corral,\r\nand after receiving many a hard knock they gained what was called\r\ntwo turns of the rock. There they paused and looked around, wondering\r\nat their success thus far. Supporting himself against a small tree,\r\nhis face bathed in blood, his banner rent, Corral said, “Señor Diaz,\r\nit is useless to advance farther; not a man will survive.” Then they\r\nshouted a warning to Pedro Barba, at the head of his archers, not to\r\nclimb farther. “The order is to advance!” was the reply. The next\r\nmoment Barba was wounded by a stone, and a soldier at his side was\r\nkilled. Cortés then sounded the recall, but not until eight brave men\r\nhad laid down their lives, victims of their commander’s puerility,\r\nand of the rest most of them returned wounded.[1081]\r\n\r\nThe recall was likewise prompted by the approach of a considerable\r\nforce in the valley. This the cavalry charged and quickly routed,\r\nfollowing in close pursuit, though the broken ground soon enabled\r\nthe fugitives to gain shelter. During this ride some of the horsemen\r\ncame, a league beyond, to another hill fortress, strong in its natural\r\nfeatures, and held by a large force. Near by were some springs. The\r\nneed of water was pressing, which afforded a plausible excuse for\r\nabandoning the scaling of Tlayacapan, and the whole force was moved\r\nto the springs. Early next morning Cortés examined the approaches\r\nto the new stronghold. It extended over three hills, the central\r\none exceedingly steep and held by the largest force; the others\r\neasier of ascent, though higher, and occupied by smaller numbers. In\r\nreconnoitring, Cortés advanced toward the centre. This movement led\r\nthe occupants of the other hills to infer an attack on the central\r\nheight, and they began to abandon their positions with a view to\r\nreënforce the threatened point. Observing this, Cortés ordered Barba\r\nto occupy the most commanding elevation with some fifty arquebusiers\r\nand archers, while he himself continued to scale the centre as a\r\nfeint, for there was little hope of capturing a point so steep and\r\nstrongly held. The stones and darts rained here as previously, and\r\nman after man was struck down, some bleeding freely from the wounds\r\nsustained.[1082]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Barba’s sharp-shooters had made so effective a use of their\r\nweapons that within half an hour the volleys from the fortress ceased,\r\nand the women began to wave their robes in token of truce, shouting\r\ntheir submission. Cortés graciously met the advances, and extended\r\nfull pardon. He also prevailed on the chiefs to induce the Tlayacapans\r\nto submit. On the extensive surface of the rock were collected all\r\nthe inhabitants of the neighborhood, with their effects, which Cortés\r\nordered not to be touched.[1083]\r\n\r\nThe army remained encamped for two days to refresh themselves after\r\ntheir arduous march, and after sending the wounded to Tezcuco,\r\nCortés proceeded to Huastepec. The report of the clemency extended\r\nto preceding settlements had a reassuring effect on this town, whose\r\ncacique came forth to welcome them, and tender his palace for their\r\nentertainment. This was situated in a garden, celebrated throughout\r\nNew Spain for its beauty and extent, and the immense variety of\r\nits plants, collected partly for scientific purposes. A river with\r\ntributary canals flowed through its grounds, which extended over a\r\ncircuit of nearly two leagues, murmuring its melody in unison with\r\nwinged songsters hidden in arbors or playing between bush and hedge,\r\nmingling their bright color with the green expanse. Adjacent were steep\r\nrocks, on whose smooth surface were sculptured the portraits of noted\r\nwarriors, statesmen, and orators, with hieroglyphic inscriptions of\r\ntheir fame. It was a paradise formed equally for student and idler, and\r\nto the weary soldiers no spot could perhaps have proven so grateful.\r\nCortés certainly grows ecstatic in describing it, declaring it “the\r\nlargest, most beautiful, and freshest garden ever seen.”[1084] Tempting\r\nas was the retreat, Cortés tore himself from it the following day,\r\nand proceeded in a south-westerly direction to Yauhtepec. Although\r\nmany warriors were gathered there, they fled on the approach of the\r\nSpaniards, and were chased, with some slaughter, for about two leagues,\r\ninto the town of Xiuhtepec.[1085] The women and effects there found\r\nwere appropriated as spoils, and rendered agreeable the two days’\r\nstay. The ruler failing to appear, the place was fired, and terrified\r\nby this warning the lord of Yauhtepec hastened to proffer submission.\r\n\r\nAfter a day’s hard march the army came in sight of Quauhnahuac,[1086]\r\ncapital of the Tlahuicas. They were one of the Nahuatlaca tribes, which\r\naccording to tradition had entered the Anáhuac country to supplant\r\nthe Toltecs. Coming rather late, they found their brethren already\r\nin possession of the lake region, and so they crossed the range to\r\nseek a home on the headwaters of the Zacatula, where soon a number\r\nof settlements rose round Quauhnahuac. They afterward fell under\r\nthe sway of the Chichimecs, and finally the Aztecs took advantage of\r\ninternal discord to establish sovereignty,[1087] maintaining it by a\r\ngarrison in the capital. This was a natural stronghold, situated on\r\na tongue of land between two steep ravines over forty feet in depth,\r\nand through which ran a little stream during the rainy season. It was\r\nfurther protected by strong walls, particularly on the side where a\r\nstrongly guarded gate opened to a fine stretch of country. Two other\r\nentrances faced the ravines, sometimes spanned by bridges, which were\r\nnow removed.\r\n\r\nSituated at the gateway to the tropical southern valleys, between\r\nwhich and the colder lake region interposed a range of mountains,\r\nthe spot stood as a new Eden in its manifold beauties. A sight even\r\nof the pine-fringed mountains that rolled off toward the north,\r\nwith their green slopes shaded by oak and birch, and bathed in soft\r\nthough bracing airs, was refreshing to the indolent inhabitants of\r\nthe burning plain beyond. On the other hand the sturdy toilers of\r\nthe northern plateaux might in this sunny south seek relaxation in\r\nthe varied charms of a softer air balmy with the incense of a more\r\nlustrous vegetation.[1088]\r\n\r\nIt was an opulent community that of Quauhnahuac, surrounded as it was\r\nby endless resources and advantages, and the people were in no mood\r\ntamely to yield their wealth to invaders. And in this determination\r\nthey were sustained by their lord, Yohuatzin,[1089] who was not only a\r\nvassal but a relative of Quauhtemotzin. Confident in the impregnable\r\nposition of his city, in which supplies were ample, he replied with\r\nvolleys to the demands of the Spanish forces as they appeared on the\r\nother side of the ravines. It seemed almost impossible to effect\r\na crossing and climb the steep wall of the ravine to the city;\r\nnevertheless Cortés selected a position and began to open fire so as\r\nto occupy the attention of the garrison and cover the scaling parties.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus busied a brave Tlascaltec reconnoitred and came\r\nto a point half a league beyond, where the ravine was steepest and\r\nnarrowed to an abyss. On the two sides grew two large trees, which\r\ninclined toward each other, with branches intertwined, forming a sort\r\nof natural bridge, though by no means secure. He called the attention\r\nof his party to this and led the way across, followed by several\r\nSpaniards. The natives, who were more accustomed to this kind of\r\ntactics, found comparatively little difficulty in swinging themselves\r\nacross; but to the soldiers it was far from easy, and three of them,\r\novercome by dizziness or weight of armor, slipped and fell.[1090]\r\n\r\nThe attention of the inhabitants being attracted elsewhere, a number\r\nof the invaders had gained a secure foothold within the city before\r\nthey were observed. Even now a few resolute men might have driven\r\nthem back, but such were wanting, and the sudden appearance of the\r\ndreaded white men, as if indeed they had dropped into the stronghold\r\nfrom some cloud made radiant by the sun whose reputed children they\r\nwere, struck terror to the hearts of the poor natives. All impotent\r\nand nerveless, they permitted the daring strangers to lower the\r\ndrawbridge, and turned to spread the panic. Meanwhile the reports\r\nof a formidable army advancing from the rear so wrought on the fears\r\nof the garrison that, when the handful who had crossed on the bushy\r\nbridge fell on them, they offered no resistance. This also allowed\r\nthe scaling forces to pour in, so that within a short time the siege\r\nwas turned into a rout, wherein the cavalry played a prominent part.\r\nThe zeal of the allies was already indicated by smoky columns in\r\ndifferent parts of the city, and the foot-soldiers hastened to share\r\nin the rich plunder and intercept the women.\r\n\r\nMost of the fugitives had gathered on an adjacent height, and though\r\nno attempt was made that day to molest them, yet they began to fear\r\nthat men who could so readily capture one of the strongest fortresses\r\nin the country, would find no difficulty in reaching them anywhere;\r\ntherefore, after listening to the advice of messengers sent by\r\nCortés, Yohuatzin concluded to surrender, and presented himself on the\r\nfollowing day with a large retinue and rich presents. The Mexicans were\r\nas usual blamed for the opposition offered. He would have submitted\r\nbefore, but thought it best to expiate the fault of resistance by\r\nallowing the Spaniards to pursue, so that after spending their fury\r\nthey might be more ready to forgive.[1091]\r\n\r\nThere was no time at present to extend the reconnoissance farther\r\nin this direction, and after a brief rest Cortés turned northward\r\nto the lakes. The route over the mountains proved far more difficult\r\nthan before, and after issuing from the pine forest the army entered\r\na desert country terminating in a three-league pass through the\r\nAjuzco Mountains. Here thirst became so intense that several natives\r\nsuccumbed.[1092] This suffering was relieved in a hamlet not far from\r\nthe pass.\r\n\r\nOn the following day they passed through a fine and cultivated\r\ncountry toward Xochilmilco, that is to say, Field of Flowers, aptly\r\nnamed, for round almost every house, particularly on the outskirts,\r\nwas a flower-garden enclosed by canals. Many of them were of the\r\nchinampa class, or floating gardens,[1093] the outgrowth of early\r\nAztec weakness, now forming a picturesque border to the lake towns.\r\nAltogether the aspect was most pleasing, while the buildings of the\r\ncentral parts were artistic and striking. Besides the strength added\r\nby canals and moats, pile buildings were frequent, and intrenchments\r\nhad been thrown up and drawbridges raised to defend the approach\r\nagainst any enemy of the Aztecs, for its loyalty to the queen city\r\nwas fully as great as that of Iztapalapan. It was the most important\r\nplace on the thickly settled fresh-water lake. Bishop Garcés relates\r\nthat angels were heard to sing praises in the Mexican tongue when it\r\nwas converted.[1094] The usual summons was issued by the Spaniards,\r\nand no heed being given, they attacked in three divisions by different\r\napproaches. The enemy fell back behind the raised bridges and\r\nintrenchments, whence they kept up a steady volley. The archers and\r\narquebusiers replied briskly, and covered the van as it plunged into\r\nnot very deep water and waded across to capture the fortifications.\r\nThis effected, the foe was driven from one retreat to another. Seeing\r\nhow affairs went, they sought to parley, but the pursuers paid no\r\nheed, regarding it as a trick to gain time for the removal of their\r\nfamilies and property. Within half an hour the greater part of the city\r\nwas won, and soldiers and allies were sacking as they advanced. The\r\nfoe rallied now and then to cover their retreat, and in one instance\r\nmanaged to despatch two soldiers who had allowed avarice to overcome\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\nNot long after, a body of some ten thousand warriors, reënforced by\r\nfugitives from the city, was seen advancing from the rear as if to\r\ncut off retreat. They were already close at hand when first observed,\r\nand without losing a moment Cortés charged them at the head of a body\r\nof cavalry.[1095]\r\n\r\nAt first they boldly faced the animals, and fought so well as to\r\nseverely wound four, besides several riders; but the mounted body\r\nkept breaking through their ranks and then turned to fall on the rear.\r\nThis movement proved decisive, and the enemy dispersed in flight, the\r\nhorsemen scattering in pursuit. Already weakened by the severe march\r\nacross the mountains, the horse of Cortés became quite exhausted,\r\nand while its rider was striking right and left into a large body of\r\nfugitives, it fell. No other horseman being near, the enemy gathered\r\ncourage and rushed upon the general, who had risen to his feet and\r\nstood with sword in hand to defend himself. It was a critical moment,\r\nand had not a brave Tlascaltec warrior come to his rescue thus\r\nopportunely, the career of the Estremaduran would have ended there;\r\nfor he had already received a severe blow on the head and was about\r\nto be dragged away when thus rescued. The general’s body-guard then\r\ncame up and cut in pieces his late stupid assailants—stupid because\r\nthey might so easily have killed him, and did not.[1096] The pursuit\r\nwas not long maintained, tired as the horses were, and remounting\r\nhis steed Cortés led the way back to camp in the square.\r\n\r\nLate as it was he superintended the filling of all the channels which\r\nbroke the causeways, and the erection of defences, and ordered the\r\nsoldiers to put in order their arms and prepare arrows. The forces\r\nwere distributed at three points, and extra guards were posted for\r\nthe night, together with bodies of troops at probable landing-points.\r\nThese precautions were prompted chiefly by the evident effort of the\r\nlast body of the enemy to shut up the army within the city, a movement\r\nwhich boded other attempts, as Cortés rightly supposed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Quauhtemotzin heard that the Spaniards had marched against\r\nXochimilco he called a council to consider the course to adopt, and\r\nthe result was the despatch of reënforcements. Finding that the city\r\nhad so easily fallen, he became furious. The gods were indignant at\r\nthe outrages of the strangers. Arms must be employed more manfully,\r\nand, these failing, the loyal ones must let their nails grow, as the\r\nlast means of protection. The first step should be the recovery of\r\nXochimilco. That very night two thousand canoes were sent with some\r\ntwelve thousand warriors, and a similar force by land, all approaching\r\nstealthily, without music.[1097]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rumor of a probable night attack kept the Spanish camp on the\r\nalert, and advised of this, the enemy made no attack. At dawn their\r\ncanoes were already swarming round the city, the inmates rending the\r\nair with loud and repeated shouts, and brandishing their weapons,\r\nthose of the chiefs being captured Spanish swords. “With your own\r\narms you shall be killed, and we will eat you!” they cried. “We fear\r\nyou not, for Montezuma is dead!” At the same time the land forces\r\nwere seen approaching, evidently to assist the fleet in besieging\r\nthe Spaniards within the city, which would give the Mexicans greater\r\nadvantage, as they had well learned during the siege of Mexico. Cortés\r\nunderstood the manœuvre, and leaving the greater part of the infantry\r\nand allies to guard the city, he sallied with most of the horse, in\r\nthree parties, a few of the infantry and several hundred Tlascaltecs,\r\nbreaking through the enemy’s ranks and gaining the foot of a hill in\r\ntheir rear, the Tepechpan.\r\n\r\nWhile the enemy were rallying, Cortés led the horse round to their\r\ndenser flank, and gave orders to the infantry to allure the Mexicans\r\nby climbing the steepest part of the hill and pretending to escape.\r\nThis succeeded, and the next moment they were attacked in several\r\ndirections with such effect as to cause a panic and drive them in\r\nflight toward a quarter where one division of horse had taken a\r\nstand. Five hundred Mexicans covered the field and five leaders were\r\namong the captured, while the Spanish loss was only one soldier and\r\na few allies, including three Tlascaltec chiefs, although a number\r\nwere wounded. During the pursuit the foremost division of horse came\r\nupon a further Mexican reënforcement, estimated at ten thousand,\r\nwhich rallied the fugitives and caused the pursuers to halt. Soon,\r\nhowever, the remaining force came up, the charge was continued, and\r\nthe Mexicans routed.[1098]\r\n\r\nToo tired for long pursuit, the Spaniards returned by ten o’clock\r\nin the morning to Xochimilco, where their garrison had repulsed the\r\nlake force. The fight had been fierce, and the soldiers had exhausted\r\nall their ammunition, capturing in return two Spanish swords. These\r\nvictories brought little satisfaction, however, for the captives\r\ngave information that the forces so far sent were but detachments\r\nof the armies destined for Xochimilco, which must be recovered, and\r\nthe Spaniards driven forth, if it cost the lives of all the men in\r\nMexico. The Spaniards might defeat force after force, but even victory\r\nmust so weaken them that the Mexicans would finally triumph. This\r\nseemed to be confirmed by the movements of the fleet, which, though\r\nrepulsed, was still hovering thereabout.\r\n\r\nCortés now gave orders to burn the city, as a warning to the wilful\r\ninhabitants and preparatory to its evacuation. The soldiers, who\r\nhad been interrupted in their plundering the day before, obeyed with\r\nalacrity. Xochimilco was a wealthy city, and not a Spaniard or ally\r\nbut obtained an abundance of robes, feathers, and other effects, and\r\neven some gold, which helped to cheer those whom ordinary merchandise\r\nand slaves did not satisfy. The enemy had been watchful, however, and\r\nin their canoes they flitted round the city to cut off stragglers.\r\nAt one point quite a charge was made, wherein several Spaniards were\r\nwounded and four carried off alive. This event did more to cast\r\na gloom over the army than many defeats, for all knew the fate of\r\nprisoners.[1099]\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of three days, all fraught with hard fighting, the army\r\nfiled out from Xochimilco, presenting the appearance of a dilapidated\r\ncaravan rather than of a reconnoitring and fighting expedition, so\r\nmuch so that Cortés thought it necessary to remonstrate, but in vain.\r\nThe enemy hovered about like vultures, to harass them in what they\r\nregarded as a retreat. The march was made in regular fighting order,\r\nwith cavalry distributed in three sections, in van, rear, and on flank.\r\nIn order to complete the reconnoissance, a north-westerly route was\r\ntaken to Coyuhuacan, the centre of a series of inner towns which lay\r\nclustered within a radius of a league and a half, along the shores or\r\nupon islands in the lake, all picturesque in their pyramidal temples\r\nand their white walls, which gleamed amidst blooming orchards and\r\nshady groves. Coyuhuacan itself was a beautiful town, and Cortés felt\r\nso captivated with it that he afterward made it for some time his\r\nfavorite residence.[1100] It had been evacuated, but toward and beyond\r\nMexico the lake teemed with canoes, while in every direction spread\r\none continuous extent of farms and hamlets, connected by causeways\r\nand roads with busy traffic. To Alderete and friar Melgarejo this\r\nwas a novel scene, and they could not refrain from expressing their\r\nadmiration at the enterprise and prowess of Cortés and his followers\r\nin undertaking so vast a conquest. God’s aid alone could have enabled\r\nthem to succeed as they had done.[1101]\r\n\r\nThe army remained here over the following day, chiefly to examine\r\nthe place as intended head-quarters of a besieging force. It was\r\nfound satisfactory; and while arrows were prepared and the wounded\r\ntended, the general advanced along the causeway leading to Mexico\r\nand expended his remaining ammunition in the useless capture of the\r\ntemple fortress of Xoloc,[1102] during which a number of soldiers were\r\nwounded, though the enemy suffered considerably. After offering to\r\nheaven the fiery sacrifice of pagan temple, the army proceeded through\r\nTlacopan without halting, for they had no ammunition, and this place\r\nhad been examined on the previous expedition. This unexpected haste\r\nencouraged the Mexicans to come forth in great numbers and attack\r\nthe baggage train and rear. Owing to the level nature of the ground\r\nthe cavalry found no difficulty in repelling them, yet they caused\r\nmore trouble, and succeeded even in carrying off two of the favorite\r\nequerries[1103] of Cortés. He was deeply grieved at the loss, and\r\npartly with a view to avenge them, partly to inflict a lesson which\r\nshould save the army from such annoyance, he formed an ambuscade beside\r\nthe road with twenty horse. Seeing the other ten horses engaged as\r\nformerly in covering the rear, the Mexicans continued their pursuit.\r\nAt a favorable moment the hidden horsemen appeared, and soon over a\r\nhundred of the flower of the Mexicans lay dead upon the ground,[1104]\r\ntheir rich panoplies, dresses, and arms offering a pleasing addition\r\nto the already heavy plunder. Freed from further molestation, the\r\narmy proceeded through Azcapuzalco and Tenayocan to Quauhtitlan, all\r\ndeserted. Here the army clustered round camp fires of green wood, wet\r\nfrom a recent shower and supperless. Next morning they followed the\r\nroute already pursued during the flight from Mexico, round Zumpango\r\nLake through Citlaltepec, and thence through Acolman to Tezcuco.[1105]\r\n\r\nA mass of booty and slaves being now at hand, a general distribution\r\nwas ordered, the second in Tezcuco. Again, says Bernal Diaz, Cortés\r\ndisregarded his promises and secured not only for himself the\r\nobjectionable fifth, but allowed his favorites to carry off the\r\nprettiest women before they were brought forward at auction. Many\r\nwho remembered the former tricks hid their women and said they had\r\nescaped, or they declared them free servants from allied tribes;\r\nwhile a few managed to obtain a private branding, paying the fifth\r\nrequired. A large proportion of the soldiers were so heavily in debt\r\nfor stores and fifths that their booty left them no surplus.[1106]\r\n\r\nWhile the reconnoitring expeditions had on the whole been fraught\r\nwith pecuniary benefit and glory, they had nevertheless served to open\r\nthe eyes of many to the difficulty of the great purpose, the capture\r\nof Mexico. This was particularly the case with the Velazquez party,\r\nwhose adhesion before the Tepeaca campaign had been compulsory, and\r\nafter it mercenary in its motives. Every obstacle to them appeared\r\nterrible, magnified through constant fear of the dreaded stone of\r\nsacrifice, on which so many comrades had already been laid. And this\r\nthey were encountering for what? the advancement of an envied usurper\r\nand a pecuniary reward far beneath their expectations. The failure\r\nat Iztapalapan, the repeated inroads of the Mexicans, unabashed by\r\nconstant repulses, and the hardships of the campaigns, particularly\r\nthe last, all tended to support their arguments against Cortés’ plans\r\nas chimerical, involving long delays, constant toil, and waste of\r\nlife, and with poor recompense save for Cortés and his favorites.\r\n\r\nPresently the affair assumed the color of conspiracy, headed by\r\nAntonio de Villafañe, a common soldier from Zamora, who is claimed\r\nby Herrera to have had the active or passive sympathy of some three\r\nhundred malcontents, nearly one third of the army. The professed\r\nobject was to secure a pliable leader who would consult the wishes\r\nof the soldiers, even those desirous of returning. Such a man, and\r\nwithal of great influence and valor, was Verdugo, the brother-in-law\r\nof the all-powerful patron Velazquez, and him the conspirators chose\r\nas the new captain-general, unknown to himself, since he might prove\r\ntoo honorable to engage in plots against the commander. As a reward\r\nfor his own efforts Villafañe claimed the position of alguacil mayor,\r\nwhile other friends and influential men of Narvaez were assured of the\r\nremaining offices, from alcalde mayor and maestre de campo downward,\r\nnow held by the retainers of Cortés, as well as a share in the arms\r\nand other effects of the doomed number.[1107] It was arranged that\r\nwhen Cortés was seated at table with his intimate friends, as Alvarado,\r\nSandoval, Olid, and Tápia, a letter was to be handed him, as if coming\r\nfrom his father, and while he was reading, the conspirators should\r\nfall on and stab him and his supporters, since all must be removed\r\nwho might prove troublesome. The new officers were thereupon to be\r\nproclaimed, together with the liberal plan agreed on, by which it\r\nwas hoped to allure even the friends of Cortés.\r\n\r\nThere were too many in the secret, however, and Cortés was a man of\r\nmagnetic influence. At the eleventh hour, two days after the return\r\nfrom Xochimilco, says Diaz, an accomplice, struck with compunction,\r\nrushed distractedly to the feet of Cortés and implored pardon for\r\nhaving even dared to listen to the vile machinations. He thereupon\r\nrevealed the plot and stated that Villafañe carried the names and\r\ndetails on a list in his breast-pocket. Cortés quietly summoned his\r\ncaptains. He represented the need for a “remedy, since, besides the\r\nscandal, it was evident that all the Spaniards must perish if once\r\nthey turned one against the other; and to this end not only declared\r\nfoes but allies would join.”[1108]\r\n\r\nAttended by Sandoval and others, Cortés hastened to the house of the\r\naccused and found several persons assembled. Some were secured as they\r\nsought escape. Villafañe found time to take a paper from his breast and\r\ntear it in pieces, but Cortés gathered and arranged them,[1109] and\r\nwas grieved to read the names of quite a number of promising persons\r\nwhom he had honored and regarded as friends. Villafañe confessed\r\nthe details of the plot, which had been forming since the Tepeaca\r\ncampaign. A court-martial was held, presided over by Cortés himself,\r\nand there being no doubt of his guilt, the accused was condemned to\r\ndeath and promptly hanged from the window of his dwelling.[1110]\r\n\r\nCortés had probably no doubt regarding the guilt of the persons named\r\non the list, but the prosecution of so many notable men might not\r\nbe prudent, and would only widen the breach between himself and the\r\nmalcontents and gain them sympathy. The day following the execution\r\nthe general called a meeting. Many were the consciences that pricked\r\ntheir possessors to trembling on that occasion. But the sage Cortés\r\npreferred the traitors should risk their necks in winning for him\r\nMexico, rather than himself to break them with a rope.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, who in national warfare could open with his sword the veins\r\nof the people until there poured forth torrents of blood, shrank in\r\nhorror from blood shed in civil broils. It was policy with Cortés,\r\nhowever. So, after finishing his narration of the conspiracy, he coolly\r\ninformed them that Villafañe had refused to reveal his accomplices,\r\nand he could not therefore name the guilty. There were no doubt men\r\namongst them with real or fancied grievances which may have induced\r\nthem to harbor resentment; but let them frankly state their wrongs\r\nand he would seek to right them. If he had erred, let the error be\r\nnamed. The conclusion of the affair created general satisfaction.\r\nThankful for their escape, the guilty sought both by words and deeds\r\nto prove their devotion, and although Cortés kept his eye upon them,\r\nthere was no indication that he suspected any. He rather sought to win\r\nthem back with favors.[1111] So impressed were his intimate followers\r\nby the risk to which so valuable a life had been exposed that they\r\ninsisted on his accepting a body-guard of twelve select men, under\r\nthe command of Antonio de Quiñones, an hidalgo of Zamora,[1112] who\r\nwatched over him day and night.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [1062] This is according to Cortés; others differ slightly,\r\n     and Ixtlilxochitl increases the Tezcucan force to 60,000.\r\n     _Hor. Crueldades_, 13.\r\n\r\n     [1063] From _tocatl_ and _xal_, spider and sand.\r\n     _Chimalpain_, _Hist. Conq._, ii. 29. The lake in which it\r\n     lies is divided about the centre by an artificial causeway\r\n     about one league long, running from east to west, the\r\n     southern water being now known as San Cristóbal Ecatepec,\r\n     from the town of that name, and the northern water as\r\n     Xaltocan or Tomanitla, San Cristóbal being also the general\r\n     term for both waters.\r\n\r\n     [1064] See _Native Races_, ii. v.\r\n\r\n     [1065] Bachiller Alonso Perez, afterward fiscal of Mexico.\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 135.\r\n\r\n     [1066] This incident was commemorated by some poetic follower\r\n     in a ballad which became a favorite with the conquerors:\r\n\r\n               En Tacuba está Cortés,\r\n               Con su esquadron esforçado,\r\n               Triste estaua, y muy penoso,\r\n               Triste, y con gran cuidado,\r\n               La vna mano en la mexilla,\r\n               Y la otra en el costado.\r\n\r\n     Which may be translated literally:\r\n\r\n               In Tacuba stands Cortés,\r\n               With his troopers strong and brave:\r\n               Sad he was and deeply grave;\r\n               Sad, and heavily oppressed.\r\n               With one hand his cheek he pressed;\r\n               Against his side, the other.\r\n\r\n     [1067] So runs Bernal Diaz’ account, which appears a little\r\n     exaggerated, for recently Cortés had shown the greatest\r\n     caution, and would hardly have allowed himself to be so\r\n     readily trapped on so memorable a spot. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     126. Cortés states that not a Spaniard was lost, though\r\n     several Mexicans fell. _Cartas_, 187.\r\n\r\n     [1068] _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. i. cap. vii.\r\n\r\n     [1069] They begged permission to return home, says\r\n     Chimalpain, _Hist. Conq._, i. 31. Herrera relates that\r\n     the efforts of Ojeda, by Cortés’ order, to take from the\r\n     Tlascaltecs the gold part of their booty so offended them\r\n     that they began to desert. The extortion was accordingly\r\n     stopped, dec. iii. lib. i. cap. vii. Clavigero doubts\r\n     the story. Prescott regards the departure of the allies\r\n     as distasteful to Cortés; but we have seen that he did\r\n     not care at present to encumber himself with too many\r\n     unruly auxiliaries to prey upon the peaceful provinces.\r\n     The Tlascaltecs would willingly have remained to share in\r\n     raiding expeditions.\r\n\r\n     [1070] Including 8000 Tezcucans under Chichinquatzin.\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hor. Crueldades_, 15. On March 12th, says\r\n     Vetancurt, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 154.\r\n\r\n     [1071] Also known as Chimalhuacan-Chalco, to distinguish\r\n     it from Chimalhuacan on Tezcuco Lake.\r\n\r\n     [1072] Lorenzana inspected the position in later times.\r\n     _Cortés_, _Hist. N. Esp._, 214.\r\n\r\n     [1073] ‘Que todos los que allí se hallaron afirman.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 190. The general lauds the achievement\r\n     with rare fervor for him. Bernal Diaz sneers at the river\r\n     of blood story; but then he was not present to share the\r\n     glory. The Roman Mario was less dainty than these Spaniards\r\n     under a similar circumstance, commemorated by Plutarch;\r\n     or as Floro more prosaically puts it: ‘Ut victor Romanus\r\n     de cruento flumine non plus aquæ biberit quam sanguinis\r\n     barbarorum.’ _Epitome_, lib. iii. cap. iii.\r\n\r\n     [1074] Fifteen, says Bernal Diaz. Chimalpain, the Chalcan\r\n     narrator, states that his tribe lost 350 men, but killed\r\n     1500 foes, capturing the captain-general, Chimalpopocatzin,\r\n     a relative of the emperor, who now became a captain among\r\n     the Tezcucans, and was killed during the siege. _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, ii. 34. Some of these facts are evidently not very\r\n     reliable. He also assumes that Sandoval lost eight soldiers\r\n     on again returning to Tezcuco.\r\n\r\n     [1075] The ‘comissario’ or clerk in charge of the bulls\r\n     was Gerónimo Lopez, afterward secretary at Mexico. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 129. This author names several of\r\n     the arrivals, some of whom became captains of vessels. A\r\n     number also arrived during the following week, he adds,\r\n     notably in Juan de Búrgos’ vessel, which brought much\r\n     material.\r\n\r\n     [1076] Gomara mentions also Maxcaltzinco as a distant place.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 186.\r\n\r\n     [1077] The chiefs were awaiting orders to appear before\r\n     Cortés. The general told them to wait till tranquillity\r\n     was more fully restored. The name of the other soldier was\r\n     Nicolás. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 203-5. Herrera assumes that\r\n     Barrientos arrived in camp during the late Tepeaca campaign,\r\n     dec. ii. lib. x. cap. xvii.\r\n\r\n     [1078] Of the rank and file none suffered penalty on\r\n     returning, for captivity was regarded as disgraceful only\r\n     to a noble. _Native Races_, ii. 419.\r\n\r\n     [1079] Bernal Diaz states that the soldiers were tired of\r\n     these repeated calls, many being also on the sick-list,\r\n     but Cortés had now a large fresh force only too eager for\r\n     a fray attended with spoliation.\r\n\r\n     [1080] According to a native painting the army entered here\r\n     April 5th, which is a day or two too early, and received\r\n     a reënforcement of 20,000. See copy in Carbajal Espinosa,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, ii. 523.\r\n\r\n     [1081] So says Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 130, who names\r\n     four. Cortés allows only two killed and twenty wounded; how\r\n     many fatally so, he carefully omits to mention. _Cartas_,\r\n     194.\r\n\r\n     [1082] Twenty fell, says Bernal Diaz. He speaks of two\r\n     futile attempts on the previous evening to scale the central\r\n     hill. It seems unlikely for soldiers, tired by repulse and\r\n     march, to undertake so difficult a feat, and that at the\r\n     least assailable point.\r\n\r\n     [1083] Yet Bernal Diaz relates a story to show that the\r\n     order was a mere pretence.\r\n\r\n     [1084] _Cartas_, 196; _Torquemada_, i. 536.\r\n\r\n     [1085] Some write Xilotepec. Bernal Diaz mentions Tepoxtlan,\r\n     which may have been visited by a detachment.\r\n\r\n     [1086] Place of the Eagle. Corrupted into the present\r\n     Cuernavaca, which singularly enough means cow’s horn.\r\n\r\n     [1087] See _Native Races_, v.\r\n\r\n     [1088] Cortés was so captivated by the alluring clime and\r\n     scenery that he made the town his favorite residence in\r\n     later years. It was included in the domains granted to him,\r\n     and descended to his heirs. Madame Calderon speaks of his\r\n     ruined palace and church. _Life in Mexico_, ii. 50.\r\n\r\n     [1089] _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist. Chich._, 311. Brasseur de\r\n     Bourbourg calls him Yaomahuitl.\r\n\r\n     [1090] ‘El vno se quebró la pierna ... y se me desvanecia\r\n     la cabeça, y todavia pasè yo, y otros veinte, ô trienta\r\n     soldados.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 132. Solis\r\n     misinterprets the passage, and gives this author credit for\r\n     leading the party. _Hist. Mex._, ii. 362. Vetancurt calls\r\n     the district toward this spot Amanalco. _Teatro Mex._, pt.\r\n     iii. 155.\r\n\r\n     [1091] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 196. Ixtlilxochitl assumes that\r\n     the submission is tendered through his namesake, as prince\r\n     of Tezcuco, the only capital of the tripartite empire loyal\r\n     to the Spaniards. _Hor. Crueldades_, 17-18.\r\n\r\n     [1092] Also one old Spaniard, believes Bernal Diaz, who\r\n     relates his own sufferings minutely, and how he followed\r\n     some mounted scouts in search of water, which he found,\r\n     bringing a supply to Cortés. _Hist. Verdad._, 133. Vetancurt\r\n     names this watering-place Topilejo, now San Miguel. _Teatro\r\n     Mex._, pt. iii. 155. Chimalpain mentions Quauhxômolco, just\r\n     before. _Hist. Conq._, ii. 40.\r\n\r\n     [1093] See _Native Races_, ii., 345.\r\n\r\n     [1094] _Lorenzana_, in _Cortés_, _Hist. N. Esp._, 225.\r\n\r\n     [1095] Six, says Cortés.\r\n\r\n     [1096] Bernal Diaz states that a soldier named Olea was the\r\n     main instrument in saving Cortés, _Hist. Verdad._, 133; but\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl, _Hist. Chich._, 311, gives the credit to the\r\n     Tlascaltec lord Chichimecatl, and Chimalpain to a noble\r\n     named Ocelotzin. _Hist. Conq._, ii. 41. Cortés says: ‘Un\r\n     indio de los de Tlascaltecal,’ _Cartas_, 199, who could not\r\n     be found the next day, and Cortés accordingly attributed\r\n     the aid, writes Herrera, to St Peter, dec. iii. lib. i.\r\n     cap. viii.\r\n\r\n     [1097] Followed by other bodies. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 134; _Torquemada_, i. 537.\r\n\r\n     [1098] Cortés leaves the impression that the foremost\r\n     division of six horse defeated the foe. Both Gomara and\r\n     Herrera are confused, and Prescott and others are led into\r\n     several mistakes.\r\n\r\n     [1099] Bernal Diaz names two of them.\r\n\r\n     [1100] He even willed that his bones should there be\r\n     entombed, a request which was not carried out.\r\n\r\n     [1101] ‘No eran cosas de hombres humanos ... que ayan hecho\r\n     ningunos vasallos tan grandes servicios a su Rey ... y\r\n     dello harian relacion a su Magestad.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 135.\r\n\r\n     [1102] At the junctions of the causeways which led from\r\n     the different shores to the southern avenue of Mexico. The\r\n     place is also known as Acachinanco.\r\n\r\n     [1103] Bernal Diaz states that Cortés was preparing an\r\n     ambuscade with ten horse and four equerries when he fell\r\n     into one himself and lost the two, whom he names. Alarmed\r\n     at his delay, Alvarado went back to look for him. loc. cit.\r\n     This is less likely than the version of Cortés.\r\n\r\n     [1104] Nobles they are termed, and Herrera doubles the\r\n     number.\r\n\r\n     [1105] Prescott and others intimate that they passed between\r\n     the lakes, from Quauhtitlan to Acolman, but Cortés mentions\r\n     Zilotepec, which may be identical with Citlaltepec, as\r\n     mentioned by Herrera, or Xilotzinco, about two leagues\r\n     eastward, as given by Ixtlilxochitl. Bernal Diaz also\r\n     appears to indicate the northern route.\r\n\r\n     [1106] _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 129.\r\n\r\n     [1107] Bernal Diaz assumes that more than one captain-general\r\n     was to be appointed. ‘Para boluerse a Cuba, y deshazer a\r\n     Cortes,’ is all the explanation given by Gomara, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 178.\r\n\r\n     [1108] Such are in substance the words used by Cortés in\r\n     his relation to the emperor. ‘E cómo yo vi que se me habia\r\n     revelado tan gran traicion, dí gracias á nuestro Señor,\r\n     porque en aquello consistia el remedio.’ _Cartas_, 269.\r\n\r\n     [1109] So Cortés intimates, while Herrera states that\r\n     Villafañe hastened to devour the paper. His throat being\r\n     pressed, about half of it was rescued. dec. iii. lib. i.\r\n     cap. i. He further says that Sandoval was sent to make\r\n     the arrest; but Bernal Diaz asserts that Cortés went in\r\n     person, which is likely under the circumstances, and took\r\n     from Villafañe’s breast the paper. Finding thereon so many\r\n     names of quality he caused it to be rumored that the man had\r\n     eaten it, or part of it. _Hist. Verdad._, 136-7. Clavigero\r\n     assumes that the culprit revealed the names, and that\r\n     Cortés preferred not to believe him. _Storia Mess._, iii.\r\n     191. Torture failed to extort any names from him, writes\r\n     Torquemada, i. 528, and those on the list he declared to\r\n     be merely of men whom he intended to sound.\r\n\r\n     [1110] ‘Un alcalde y yo lo condenamos á muerte.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 269.\r\n\r\n     [1111] Bernal Diaz states that he frightened many by having\r\n     them arrested and threatened with trial; probably those\r\n     seized with Villafañe. Oviedo, iii. 515, mentions Escudero\r\n     as executed for plotting; but this is doubtful. As for\r\n     Verdugo, he became regidor of Mexico, and in 1529 alcalde.\r\n     He afterward joined Guzman’s expedition and settled at\r\n     Tonalá in Jalisco. _Razon_, in _Cortés_, _Residencia_, i.\r\n     363.\r\n\r\n     [1112] This was Cortés’ own idea, says Bernal Diaz, and\r\n     he appealed to us to guard him. _Hist. Verdad._, 137.\r\n     Quiñones was succeeded by Francisco de Tenesas [Terrazas].\r\n     _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hist.

A very bad person\r\nmay do mankind a great service. An evil-minded man, while sinking his\r\nsoul yet deeper in corruption, may bring benefactions upon society.\r\nBut even a fairly good man cannot increase his innate nobleness of\r\ncharacter while doing injury to his fellows.\r\n\r\nI do not know that the claim of good man was ever advanced for Hernan\r\nCortés, except, indeed, by that strange fanaticism which, dazzled\r\nby one object, fails to see other objects, or the terrible means for\r\ntheir attainment. He and his followers formed a sad mixture of good\r\nand evil, in which the latter predominated, if judged by the moral\r\nstandard which they had formed for themselves as soldiers of the cross.\r\nThe grossest injustice, the most horrible wickedness constituted\r\npart of their moral ideal, so that while fighting for the highest\r\nmorality they were the most immoral of men. Long after the conquest\r\nwas consummated, under the ministrations of men of piety and ability,\r\nit would seem that the weapons used by these conquerors, who at times\r\njustified murder as the highest morality, were still instinct with\r\nblood, even as the cornel-wood spear with which the king of Thrace\r\ntransfixed the unhappy Polydorus springs into life instinct with the\r\nblood of Priam’s slaughtered son.\r\n\r\nCortés was not an idealist after the manner of Columbus. Both were full\r\nof egoism; the spiritual-mindedness of both was essentially selfish.\r\nThey would both dictate terms to God and their king, that for so much\r\nservice they must have so much reward. Both were full of the follies\r\nof their day; but Columbus displayed a grave, unconscious folly, while\r\nCortés consciously indulged in all the follies of lust and cruelty\r\nthat prudence admitted or his aim demanded. Cortés abandoned himself\r\nto ambition; Columbus to brooding thought. The insanity of reckless\r\nadventure was not the insanity of Columbus, who nevertheless was as\r\nmad as any lunatic in his own way. Commanding energy and practical\r\ndaring were as conspicuous in Cortés as in Columbus; but it happened\r\nthat the aims of Columbus were of greater import to the race than\r\nthose of Cortés.\r\n\r\nHow alike, and yet how different, these men! Cortés was impetuous and\r\nextravagant; Columbus calm, calculating, and prudent. One was full\r\nof joyous activity, the simple exercise of which was his greatest\r\npleasure; obligations of every sort sat lightly on him; the other was\r\nbut an instrument in the hands of providence. Both were ambitious,\r\nboth excessively religious; but Cortés, in the main, made religion\r\nsubservient to advancement, as before noted, while mundane glories\r\nto Columbus were hollow indeed beside his heavenly aspirations. Both\r\nwere exceedingly great men; both became eminent by a selfish adventure\r\nof self; but Columbus saw the New World through the glorious haze\r\nof immortality, while Cortés viewed Mexico under the lightly woven\r\ncovering of personal ambition.\r\n\r\nCortés was an Antony rather than a Cæsar, nor did he lack that one\r\ngreat gift of Antony’s, subordination, as we have seen. He was not so\r\ngreatly in love with himself, stood not so greatly in awe of himself,\r\nas Cæsar; he was possessed of finer perceptions and feelings, and\r\nwith consummate versatility could drop himself out of his plans as\r\noccasion required. Nor was Cortés without imagination and the æsthetic\r\nsense, though of a grosser and sensual kind; but it is not in great\r\nmen that we are to look for the swelling harmonies of nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA turning-point was now reached in the campaign. The brigantines were\r\ncompleted, and the siege could begin. The day for the entry of the\r\nvessels into the lake was a gala day, inaugurated with the communion\r\nand festive with the concourse of gayly attired spectators.[1113]\r\nAfter prayer and a discourse the flags with name and royal arms were\r\nhoisted on each vessel,[1114] amid salvos and cheers, and the dams\r\nbeing broken, the gallant fleet floated down the canal to the placid\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nWhile the mute bunting was thus proclaiming Spanish supremacy over\r\nthese inland waters, a Te Deum, in which joined a thousand voices,\r\nechoed aloud the gratitude of every heart. Each vessel was placed in\r\ncharge of a captain[1115] with twenty-four Spaniards, of whom about\r\nsix were cross-bowmen and arquebusiers, some artillerists to manage\r\nthe bronze gun, and twelve rowers, six to each side. The boats were\r\nevidently half-decked.[1116]\r\n\r\nActive preparations were now made to begin the siege. Tlascaltecs,\r\nHuexotzincas, Cholultecs, Chalcans, and other allies were summoned to\r\nsend in contingents by Whitsunday, the latter to assemble at Chalco,\r\nand the Tlascaltecs at Tezcuco. Though but ten days’ notice was given,\r\nthe last named presented themselves in the camp before the appointed\r\ntime to the number of over fifty thousand, which was increased by\r\nlater reënforcement.[1117]\r\n\r\nAs they approached Tezcuco under the guidance of Ojeda, and commanded\r\nnotably by Chichimecatl and Xicotencatl junior, they spread out in\r\none long serpentine file, bristling with iztli points and brilliant\r\nwith shields and armor covered with variegated devices and flowing\r\nplumage, while at intervals waved high the banners of the different\r\ncorps. Cortés went forth to meet them with grand demonstrations, and\r\nas they marched past loud vivas[1118] rent the air.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of April Cortés had mustered his forces and found that,\r\nwith the several reënforcements lately arrived, there were present\r\nover nine hundred Spaniards, of whom eighty-six were horsemen and one\r\nhundred and eighteen cross-bowmen and arquebusiers;[1119] the rest\r\nbeing armed with swords and shields and the more formidable pikes.\r\nThey were well protected with cotton armor, many having cuirasses and\r\ncorselets, and small weapons were not wanting. The artillery consisted\r\nof three heavy iron guns, fifteen smaller pieces of bronze, mostly\r\ndistributed among the vessels, with ten quintals of powder and a\r\nquantity of shot, while some fifty thousand arrows had been furnished\r\nby the Tezcucan towns, all fitted according to pattern with copper\r\ntips.[1120]\r\n\r\nNot only had the Spaniards, particularly the new recruits, been well\r\nexercised in cavalry movements, target practice, fencing, and pike\r\ndrill, but the allies had been trained to a certain extent in European\r\ntactics. For efficiency and good conduct this army rose far above\r\nany yet mustered in the Indies. In the usual speech before the ranks,\r\nCortés pointed out how God had favored them with constant victories\r\nand with reënforcements which had nearly doubled their number and\r\nresources. They might indeed be hopeful, for holy was their cause.\r\nFull of confidence they could march against the only stronghold yet\r\nopposed to them, avenge their slaughtered comrades, and win riches\r\nand glory for themselves.\r\n\r\nOn Whitmonday, the 20th of May, an apportionment of the troops was\r\nmade to Alvarado, Olid, and Sandoval, who led the cavalry in person,\r\nbut directed the movements of the infantry through captains, and of\r\nthe allies through native chiefs. Each received from twenty-four to\r\nthirty horsemen, and one hundred and fifty infantry, divided into two\r\nor three battalions, with a proportionate number of arquebusiers,\r\ncross-bowmen, guns, and ammunition, besides from twenty to forty\r\nthousand allies. To Sandoval was given the smallest number of horse and\r\nthe largest number of allies, those gathered at Chalco having orders\r\nto await him, while Alvarado received a full half of the Tlascaltec\r\nforce, with whom the Tonatiuh was a great favorite. To this leader\r\nTlacopan was assigned for head-quarters; to Olid, Coyuhuacan; and\r\nSandoval received orders to complete the destruction of Iztapalapan,\r\nand then to advance through Coyuhuacan and along one of the southern\r\ncauseways, and there to select his head-quarters, under the protection\r\nof the brigantines. These appointments and orders underwent several\r\nchanges during the siege. For himself Cortés selected the management\r\nof the fleet, whereon so much depended during the opening of the\r\nsiege, and in addition to its ships’ companies of three hundred\r\nmen he was supported by several thousand allies, chiefly Tezcucans\r\nunder Ixtlilxochitl, who attended in a large number of canoes. This\r\nselection hardly pleased the army, which considered their operations\r\nthe most important and dangerous, and therefore in need of Cortés’\r\nsupervision. But he evidently never intended to remain with the fleet\r\nexcept at the beginning.[1121]\r\n\r\nThe following day the allied forces apportioned to Alvarado and\r\nOlid were ordered to march in advance, for greater convenience,\r\nto the border of Tezcuco province and there await the Spaniards.\r\nNot many hours after their departure a messenger appeared with the\r\nannouncement that Xicotencatl, the companion general of Chichimecatl,\r\nhad disappeared. Inquiries revealed that shortly before his cousin\r\nPiltecuhtli had been severely and wantonly struck by a soldier during\r\na quarrel over some carriers. In order to save the soldier from the\r\nwrath of Cortés, Ojeda, the Spanish inspecting officer over the allied\r\nforces, smoothed the matter and sent the injured nobleman home. It\r\nwas claimed by some that this outrage had so wounded Xicotencatl\r\nthat he followed his cousin. Others assumed that both chiefs were\r\nin love with the same woman, and that Xicotencatl could not bear to\r\nleave his rival alone in the field. But the true reason lay no doubt\r\nin his dislike to fight for the Spaniards, whom he had never ceased\r\nto oppose, openly and in secret, as invaders bent on the enslavement\r\nof the whole country. This idea, if faint at first, had become more\r\nfixed with every fresh blow against his personal ambition, such as\r\nthe first series of defeats which plucked from him his just renown;\r\nthe equal or perhaps superior position assigned in the native army to\r\nChichimecatl, of whom he appears to have been deeply jealous;[1122]\r\nand the prospect of a wearisome and unprofitable campaign, wherein\r\nhe must be content to figure as a subordinate, not only of Alvarado,\r\nbut subject perhaps to the orders of petty Spanish officers. All this\r\nbecame too galling to his proud spirit, and with a few followers he\r\nturned toward his mountain home.\r\n\r\nIt would never do to countenance desertion, and by so prominent a man,\r\nat the very opening of a campaign; and Cortés immediately sent a number\r\nof troopers in pursuit, with instructions to represent to the chief\r\nthe gravity of his offence, which cast a heavy stain on Tlascaltec\r\nhonor, and to persuade him to return. They speedily overtook him,\r\nonly to meet with insolence. He would not go back; if his people had\r\nlistened to him they would not now be tools and servants of a horde\r\nof foreigners. With this reply the troops were forced to return.\r\n“This cacique is incorrigible,” exclaimed Cortés, “and will ever be a\r\ntraitor and counsellor to evil. I have had enough of him!” The troopers\r\nwere at once sent back, accompanied by an alguacil and some trusty\r\nTlascaltec nobles, with orders to arrest the fugitive and bring him\r\nto Tezcuco. In a letter to the republican lords, Cortés at the same\r\ntime complained of the desertion and its grave influence, and declared\r\nthat according to Spanish law the penalty was death. They replied\r\nthat the same punishment obtained in Tlascala; and not only do they\r\nappear to have actively aided in surrendering the culprit, but they\r\ndeclared all his property, including wives and slaves, confiscated to\r\nthe crown, against which he had sinned.[1123] Indeed, the arrogance\r\nof the young chief does not seem to have endeared him to the other\r\nrulers. Instantly on his arrival he was sentenced and hanged on a\r\nvery high gallows, while the crier and interpreter announced his crime.\r\n\r\nThe execution of so prominent a chief, heir to one of the rulers\r\namong his best allies, was an act which few besides Cortés would\r\nhave ventured on; but he saw the necessity for a firm observance of\r\ndiscipline, and was not deceived in the salutary effect which it had\r\non the allies.[1124] There were not many Tlascaltecs left in Tezcuco,\r\nor a serious demonstration might have occurred; as it was, the mantle\r\nand maxtli of the deceased were secured, and an eager contest ensued\r\nfor them as relics. Axayacatzin Xicotencatl had achieved fame before\r\nthe advent of the Spaniards.[1125]\r\n\r\nAlvarado and Olid had set out from Tezcuco for Tlacopan with their\r\nSpanish forces on the 22d of May,[1126] taking the same route by which\r\nCortés had returned from the Xochimilco campaign, and though longer\r\nthan that north of Tezcuco Lake, yet it was easier and safer. On\r\napproaching Acolman, Olid sent a party in advance to secure quarters,\r\nand when Alvarado arrived he found every house bearing the green\r\nbough on the roof, which indicated occupancy. This raised a tumult\r\nbetween the parties, and even the captains would have come to blows\r\nbut for the interference of friends. Informed of the trouble, Cortés\r\ntook steps to reconcile them, although the two leaders never renewed\r\ntheir former intimacy.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the fourth day they reached Tlacopan, which was\r\ndeserted, as were all the towns along the route.[1127] Late as was the\r\nhour, forages and reconnoissances were made, involving a skirmish with\r\nthe Mexicans. The following day, Sunday, Olid proceeded to Chapultepec\r\nto cut the aqueduct which supplied the city, a task which involved\r\nanother encounter wherein a score of Mexicans fell. Meanwhile the\r\ncanals were filled and other obstacles removed which might impede a\r\nfree advance, and foraging tours were made. The Mexicans continued to\r\nharass the operations with repeated sallies, and finally Alvarado,\r\nwith characteristic rashness, pursued them until his troops were\r\nwell advanced between the houses and bridges. The Mexicans, who had\r\nretreated on purpose, now rolled back upon his front and flanks.\r\nThe roofs, hitherto deserted, teemed with slingers and archers, who\r\nshowered their missiles with terrible effect, while from the lanes and\r\nopenings between the houses sprang numbers who assailed the cramped\r\nsoldiers with their long lances, swords, and clubs, and leaped back\r\ninto their holes and canoes and behind breastworks whenever they\r\nwere pressed. The allies were ordered back, and the Spaniards slowly\r\nretreated, with a loss of eight killed and fifty wounded, glad to be\r\nrelieved from their strait.\r\n\r\nOlid was highly incensed with Alvarado for his rashness, and regardless\r\nof all remonstrance he seized the pretext to hasten the departure\r\nto his own camp at Coyuhuacan. He established his head-quarters on\r\nCorpus Christi day, the 30th of May, and from this date, accordingly,\r\nClavigero and many others date the beginning of the siege. The causeway\r\nleading thence to Mexico was broken, and he sought for several days\r\nto cover the breaches and gain a footing upon it, but without success.\r\nThe Mexican warriors displayed great spirit, and their leaders are to\r\nbe blamed for not energetically assuming the offensive and attacking\r\nthe two camps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans had not quite understood the drift of Cortés’ delay\r\nand preliminary manœuvres. When they found two camps established,\r\nthe aqueduct destroyed, and earnest preparations in progress for\r\ninvestment, their eyes were opened; but they were then too bewildered\r\nto act with promptness and precision. The chronicles relate that\r\nQuauhtemotzin held a grand council to consider the situation, and\r\nto sound the spirit of the people for peace or war, so that there\r\nmight be no faltering when necessity came. A number indeed of the\r\nelder and wiser lords, particularly of the Montezuma faction, spoke\r\nof the formidable enginery and strength of the Spaniards, and their\r\nhost of allies, and expressed fears of failure. With the occupation\r\nof all the surrounding territory, and the influx of people from\r\nabroad, the food supply might fall short, and famine and sickness\r\nensue. But the young men and the warriors, as might be expected,\r\nwould listen to no counsellor whose words implied cowardice; they\r\nwere enthusiastic for resistance, and formed too numerous a party to\r\nallow the entertaining of peace proposals. Quauhtemotzin cautiously\r\nrefrained from committing himself,[1128] but reminded the assembly\r\nthat the oracles of their gods and heroic ancestors had above all to\r\nbe listened to in so important a matter as the preservation of the\r\nhomes and sacred temples intrusted to their care. He knew well what\r\nanswer would come from the priests, whose possessions, wealth, and\r\nhonors depended on the exclusion of invaders, aiming above all at the\r\noverthrow of their religion. “My people shall not fear the enemy,”\r\nspake the war-god Huitzilopochtli, “for the allied hosts will not\r\npersevere long in the siege, and I will scatter the Castilians now\r\nas hitherto.” This utterance suited many views, and the declaration\r\nfor war was solemnized by sacrifices of human beings, including the\r\nfour Spaniards lately captured.[1129]\r\n\r\nRenewed efforts were made to fortify and supply the city, and canoes\r\nwere collected to aid in the defence. With insolent assurance,\r\nderived from the oracles, corps of warriors would advance close to\r\nthe Spanish camps and vent their feelings with insults and menaces,\r\n“Men of evil, you shall pay for your madness! Behold, the gods have\r\nalready feasted on your bodies!” they cried, flinging in among the\r\nhorrified soldiers pieces of their sacrificed comrades. “Our snakes\r\nshall drink your blood, and our tigers devour your flesh, though they\r\nare already satiated therewith. And you, infamous Tlascaltecs, slaves\r\nand traitors! you shall atone for your misdeeds; you shall die a bad\r\ndeath, and furnish flesh for our banquets! Behold!” And therewith\r\nthey threw in disjointed pieces of dusky human bodies. “We shall\r\nnot rest till your land is desolated, and not a man or woman left to\r\nperpetuate your vile race.” Unabashed by this tirade the Tlascaltecs\r\ntold them not to threaten like women, but to act like men. Still it\r\nwere better for them to yield unless they wished to be destroyed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCortés had been delayed till the fleet should be fully prepared. On\r\nthe 31st of May, following Corpus Christi day, he was able to despatch\r\nSandoval, who, reënforced by some forty thousand allies awaiting\r\nhim on the Chalco border, marched against Iztapalapan. Although\r\nseverely crippled by Cortés’ expedition, this town still figured as\r\na stronghold of too great importance to be left in the rear. Advised\r\nof the movement, the Mexicans hurried by road and water to aid in\r\ncovering the retreat of the inhabitants. Suddenly smoke columns\r\nwere observed in different parts of the lake, and cries of alarm\r\nran through the town. Yet more and more hurriedly the people fled,\r\nand while one body of warriors retired along the causeway to Mexico,\r\nothers departed in canoes. The Spanish forces pressed onward in close\r\npursuit, and slaughter, pillage, and torch accompanied them. The\r\nchief cause of the panic was the appearance of the brigantines, which\r\nhad set sail shortly after Sandoval’s departure, attended by a large\r\nnumber of Tezcucan canoes[1130] whose object was to coöperate against\r\nIztapalapan. On approaching it the vessels passed close to a steep\r\nrocky isle, the Tepepulco, since known as El Peñol del Marqués,[1131]\r\noccupied by a large number of fugitives who shouted defiance, and\r\nshowered stones and arrows. Finding that Sandoval required no aid,\r\nCortés resolved to inflict a lesson on the insolent islanders. The\r\nMexicans appeared confident in the impregnable strength of the rock,\r\nand gave so warm a reception to the hundred and fifty men with whom\r\nCortés began to climb it, that fully a score were wounded at the\r\nonset. The brigantines turned their guns upon them, however, and under\r\nthis cover the soldiers speedily gained the summit, there to wreak\r\nbloody vengeance. Not a man was spared, only the women and children.\r\n“It was a beautiful victory!” exclaims Cortés.\r\n\r\nWhile they were pillaging, a large fleet of canoes, five hundred at\r\nthe lowest estimate,[1132] was seen to approach from the direction of\r\nMexico, bristling with iztli points, which found a gleaming reflection\r\nin the smooth waters of the lake. Cortés ordered an immediate return\r\nto the brigantines, and rowed them forward into an extended line. He\r\nhad longed for an opportunity like this, to meet a formidable fleet\r\nupon which the brigantines might inflict a lesson severe enough to\r\nopen the eyes of the enemy to their invincible power; for “in them\r\nlay the key of war,” as he expressed it. Unfortunately the wind was\r\nso light as barely to flap the sails. The hostile fleet had already\r\ndrawn up in good order just beyond range, evidently puzzled at the\r\npassive attitude of the monster vessels, yet shouting defiance.[1133]\r\nCortés stood chafing with impatience, for without wind his greatest\r\nadvantage would be lost, and his position even become precarious. Just\r\nthen the waters rippled and a breeze came from abaft which speedily\r\nfreshened. “Ah, God favors us!” he cried, and with a grateful gaze\r\ntoward heaven he gave orders to advance under full sail. As they\r\ncame close to the enemy a blinding volley was sent pouring in upon\r\nthem from the whole line, from guns, arquebuses, and cross-bows, and\r\nwhile the natives were trying to recover from their confusion, from\r\nout the smoke burst the ponderous bows, crashing into the lines of\r\ncanoes, overturning, breaking, and sinking. In the vessels’ wake were\r\nwrecks and struggling bodies, while the few canoes which had escaped\r\nby passing between the ships struggled to escape the Tezcucan boats\r\nin the rear. At the first encounter the canoes in the farther lines\r\nturned in hot haste for home, as did a vast number of others which had\r\nventured forth, partly with reënforcements, partly with spectators.\r\nBut the clumsy-looking vessels sped faster, pursuing their career\r\nof destruction for three leagues, into the very canals of the city,\r\nwhence they turned back to pick up captives. The victory exceeded the\r\nwildest hopes of the Spaniards, as Cortés admits, for not only did\r\nthe Aztecs lose a great number of their foremost warriors and their\r\nbest canoes, but they surrendered forever to the formidable craft\r\nsovereignty over the lake waters, and with it the hope of assistance\r\nfrom trans-lacustrine allies.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this success, Olid advised Alvarado, and both hastened\r\nto take advantage of the panic to advance along the causeways and\r\neffect considerable execution, impelled as they were with emulation\r\nand fresh courage.[1134] Olid had advanced close to Fort Xoloc, which\r\nwith its stout battlemented walls and towers guarded the junction of\r\nthe southern causeways, when the brigantines approached it from the\r\neastern side. It was already after vespers; nevertheless Cortés landed\r\nto coöperate with his lieutenant and pursue the advantage gained. A\r\nbreach was made in the wall with one of the heavy guns, and under\r\ncover of the fleet’s artillery the place was soon carried. Cortés\r\nhad intended to make Coyuhuacan his head-quarters, but such were the\r\nobvious advantages of Xoloc, in strength and in position, for it lay\r\nbut half a league from Mexico and was connected in the rear with the\r\nmainland by three causeways, that he at once decided to establish\r\nhis camp there, making it also his naval station.\r\n\r\nEnraged rather than discouraged by the several defeats, Quauhtemotzin\r\nordered a night attack on Xoloc, contrary to native custom. They\r\napproached both by sea and land, but owing to their noise they were\r\nobserved, and driven back by the artillery. The fort was not very\r\nstrong on the northern side, and the force within was small; but in\r\nthe morning half of Olid’s troops came to reënforce him, together\r\nwith fifty of Sandoval’s infantry. The addition was opportune, for\r\nthe Mexicans were advancing in swarms along the causeway as well as\r\nby water, this time on the inner side of the road where the vessels\r\ncould not reach them. The heavy guns soon cleared a space on the\r\nroadway, but as the soldiers pursued they suffered severely from the\r\ncanoes, which not only showered missiles but afforded retreat for\r\nthe sallying parties. Orders were accordingly given to cut a passage\r\nthrough the embankment, so that the four brigantines might enter to\r\nclear the inner basin. By this means the Spaniards were able to advance\r\nto the very entrance of the city and inflict some damage, while the\r\nremaining vessels explored the waters beyond, and drove back canoes\r\nand fired buildings in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nSandoval at the same time advanced along the causeway from Iztapalapan\r\nto Coyuhuacan. It was a league and a half in length, and a quarter\r\nof a league from shore it passed through an island town, which was\r\ncaptured and burned. Advised of this, Quauhtemotzin directed a fleet\r\nto cut the causeway and entrap the Spaniards; but before long two of\r\nthe vessels were able to relieve Sandoval, who thereupon left a portion\r\nof his troops, including the allies, at Coyuhuacan, and joined his\r\nchief with the remainder. Nearly a week was occupied in strengthening\r\nFort Xoloc, arranging the camp, and bringing in supplies, during\r\nwhich time desultory skirmishings were maintained, wherein Sandoval\r\namong others received wounds. The brigantines roamed incessantly and\r\ninflicted great damage, entering on one occasion for a long distance\r\na canal which led into the suburbs.[1135] Canoes no longer ventured\r\nabroad when a sail was in sight, and the Mexicans began to protect\r\nthe water approaches and channels with stakes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn order to complete the investment of the city it was only necessary\r\nto occupy the northern causeway to Tepeyacac, along which the\r\nbesieged maintained a steady intercourse with the mainland. Advised\r\nof this neglect by Alvarado, the general ordered Sandoval to form\r\na camp at that town[1136] with one hundred and forty Spaniards, of\r\nwhom twenty-three were horsemen, and a full proportion of allies.\r\nAlvarado had half as many more infantry and a few more cavalry, while\r\ntwo hundred infantry were quartered at Xoloc, supported besides by\r\na cavalry force in the rear, and by Olid’s party, with whom remained\r\nthe largest proportion of allies, now over eighty thousand, according\r\nto Cortés’ own statement. The fort could not hold them, and they\r\naccordingly encamped at Coyuhuacan, which lay more convenient for\r\nsupplies, and must be occupied to watch the hostile shore and lake\r\ntowns clustered in this quarter. The brigantines carried at least\r\ntwo hundred and fifty men.[1137]\r\n\r\nEverything being prepared, Cortés ordered a simultaneous attack from\r\nall the camps, so as to divide the attention of the Mexicans and gain\r\nall possible advantage. He himself advanced along the Iztapalapan\r\ncauseway with the greater part of his infantry, attended by several\r\ncavaliers on foot, and by over eighty thousand allies, while a vessel\r\nskirted the road on either side. There was more than one breach in\r\nthe road, behind which were posted large forces of warriors protected\r\nby intrenchments of earth and masonry.\r\n\r\nWithout the vessels it would have cost much time and many lives to\r\ncross; but the well-directed fire from the guns and arquebuses on the\r\nflanks and rear of the enemy soon wrought disorder, which enabled\r\nthe sallying parties to obtain a foothold. Meanwhile a number of\r\ninfantry had swum across the channel and aided to drive the Mexicans\r\nbeyond the next breach. The same manœuvre was repeated at this and\r\nthe other chasms, till the army found itself at the very entrance of\r\nthe city, protected by a wider channel than the preceding, with more\r\nextensive fortifications, commanded by a temple tower. This with its\r\nswarms of slingers and archers made the capture difficult, and the\r\nMexicans also showed more determination; but the guns and fusillade\r\ncould not be resisted, and soon the Spaniards stood within the city\r\nfor the first time since the memorable Noche Triste. Revenge seemed\r\nalready secured, and the lost treasures almost within the invaders’\r\ngrasp. Cortés, however, did not permit himself to be carried away\r\nby a momentary success. He saw the main street beyond thronged with\r\nwarriors fiercely bent on resistance, streets as far as the distant\r\ntemple of the war-god bordered with buildings, each a fortress in\r\nitself, while many a barricaded channel blocked the way.\r\n\r\nA large force of allies had been left to fill the chasm and level\r\nthe ground as the army advanced, using for this purpose the captured\r\nintrenchments and buildings, or even material from the causeway\r\nitself. This work was under the direction of Diego Hernandez, a\r\nman of herculean strength, who could throw a stone with a force and\r\nprecision, it was said, approximating those of cannon.[1138] This\r\nfilling of the chasms enabled the horses to be brought forward, and\r\nthey now led the charge against the dense masses of natives, after\r\nthe arquebuses had effected the preliminary clearing. Cortés had not\r\nunderestimated the annoyance to be encountered from the archers and\r\nslingers covering the roofs on either side; but the operations of the\r\ncavalry left the many arquebusiers and cross-bowmen at liberty to cover\r\nthe points of approach through which the allies in particular poured\r\nin countless numbers with sidearms and fire-brands. The progress so\r\nfar had surpassed all anticipation; but now the Spaniards came to\r\na canal from which the retreating Mexicans removed the few planks\r\nremaining of the bridge, leaving a solitary beam. Here the warriors\r\nwere massed in greater confidence, free as they were from the attack\r\nof vessels and sheltered by strong intrenchments, while the adjoining\r\nroofs, equally protected by the canals, teemed with missile-throwers.\r\nThe soldiers tried again and again to cross the chasm, only to be\r\ndriven back with injury. The volleys from cross-bows and fire-arms\r\ncould effect but little damage against the well sheltered warriors,\r\nwhile their arrows and stones came in rattling showers. Finally two\r\ncannon were brought forward. This changed the issue, for a breach\r\nwas speedily made in the intrenchments, and now the small-arms were\r\nable to coöperate with great execution.\r\n\r\nAfter a delay of two hours the soldiers were across; and while the\r\nallies filled the canal they again pursued their advance along the\r\navenue, though suffering considerably from the roof missiles. They\r\nnow came to the last channel in the street, close to the main plaza,\r\nwherein stood the famous temple of Huitzilopochtli.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the Spaniards had been so unexpected and rapid that\r\nthe Mexicans had not thought of fortifying this canal, and little\r\ndifficulty was met in crossing. But beyond, the plaza was filled\r\nwith files of defenders, determined to save their deities and that\r\nsacred ground. Greatly frightened, the priests cried out to them:\r\n“Behold! it was here upon this spot you fought these beings infernal\r\nbefore, and drove them forth in shameful flight; the gods will help\r\nyou again!” Even the Spanish soldiers were impressed by the words\r\nand gestures of the frantic devotees, and noted their effect in the\r\ngleaming eyes and pressed lips of the warriors, and they paused. But\r\npresently a gun was brought forward and directed against the packed\r\nthrong. This effected a backward movement. “There is no time for rest\r\nor fear!” shouted Cortés, as with shield in hand he rushed forward.\r\nWith a thundering Santiago the soldiers followed. The charge was\r\nirresistible, and already startled by the mowing cannon-balls the\r\nMexicans took refuge within the temple enclosure and in the by-streets.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards followed the crowd within the sacred grounds, slashing\r\nand thrusting. It seemed a repetition of Alvarado’s massacre, and\r\nthe war-god, thirsting for blood, might now have his fill. In a\r\nfew moments not a warrior was left round the temple, only prostrate\r\nbodies. Then the soldiers prepared to ascend the pyramid to hurl down\r\nthe idol and its defenders. But the deity was aroused. The sombre\r\nnotes of the sacred drum struck their fearful appeal on every heart,\r\n“Rouse ye to your imperilled hearths and temples!” It was but now the\r\nMexicans observed that the death-dealing horsemen were not present,\r\nfor the last channel had not yet been filled to afford a crossing.\r\nThis lent them courage, and on the foe they quickly rushed from lanes\r\nand houses, while down from the temple-top came a doubly inspired\r\navalanche. The shock was overwhelming. The Spaniards were forced to\r\nretire, partly in disorder. Cortés made frantic efforts to stay the\r\nflight, and at the gate a momentary rally was made by a few; but\r\nwhat availed that handful against the torrent sweeping onward, headed\r\nby the renowned band of Quauhtin? Perforce they must yield and join\r\nthe troops which were in such hasty flight from the plaza that they\r\neven abandoned the cannon. Cortés was on foot in the crowd, and his\r\nvoice was drowned in the tumult. He could but follow with the wild\r\ncurrent, which threatened to lead into another disaster. Just then\r\ncries of alarm burst from the crowds on the roofs, and there was a\r\nlull in the shower of stones and darts, and the pressure of pursuers\r\nrelaxed. The next moment the ears of the wandering Spaniards caught\r\nthe clatter of hoofs.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry had come up; a revulsion set in. They were but a few,[1139]\r\nbut enough to bring back to the minds of the Mexicans their original\r\nand ever present fear of the monsters, for they knew not how many\r\nmight be coming down upon them.\r\n\r\nThe infantry followed the horsemen with inspiring cheers, and bore\r\nunresisted onward, for the late bravery of the foe was now turned to\r\ncowardice. Before long the Spaniards had penetrated through the plaza\r\nand occupied once more the temple court. Once more their looks were\r\nupward toward the summit of the lofty pyramid consecrated during their\r\nformer occupation to the holy virgin; and while the main portion of the\r\ntroops fought the now rallying Mexicans, a sturdy handful undertook\r\nthe capture of the sanctuary. A dozen chiefs held possession, but\r\nnaught could stay the fury of the soldiers, and in a few moments the\r\nlast defender had yielded his spirit in defense of his faith.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards looked in vain for any trace of their own altar and\r\nsymbols, round which they had so oft congregated in prayer. In their\r\nstead rose a new idol glittering with ornaments and hideous with\r\ndevices, while fresh stains of blood spread horror over all. The\r\ngleam of gold proved all absorbing, however, and hastily the jewels\r\nand the golden mask were torn away, and then the head of the idol\r\nwas struck off and sent clattering below.[1140]\r\n\r\nThere was time for nothing more, for on finding so few horsemen\r\npresent, the Quauhtin knights had again made an effective rally,\r\npressing the troops closely. Fortunately a larger force of cavalry\r\ncame up again to turn the tide of battle and inflict a severe lesson.\r\nAs it was late by this time, there remained no choice but that\r\nof returning to camp. This movement gave fresh confidence to the\r\nMexicans, who followed in swarms, harassing from roofs and lanes,\r\non front and flanks, rushing forward with renewed fury after every\r\ncharge by the cavalry which covered the rear. But for the horses\r\nthe soldiers would have suffered severely; as it was, the retreat\r\nproceeded in good order, and as many houses as possible were fired\r\nwith a view to make the next entry safer. On approaching the causeway\r\nthe canoe crews, composed of selected warriors, fell on the flanks\r\nand created no little confusion before they were driven back. After\r\nthis no difficulty was experienced in reaching camp, thanks to the\r\nforesight of Cortés, who had ordered the channels filled.[1141] The\r\nother captains, Alvarado and Sandoval, had performed their share in\r\nthe day’s work, and although they do not appear to have reached even\r\nthe suburb, detained by the many breaches and other obstacles on\r\nthe causeways, yet the diversion created by their attacks proved of\r\ngreat service to Cortés. One reason for their slower advance was the\r\nwant of coöperation from the vessels, which had been of such great\r\nassistance on the Iztapalapan road. This was at once remedied by the\r\ndetachment of three brigantines each for the Tlacopan and Tepeyacac\r\ncamps.[1142]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [1113] Several leading authors assume this to have occurred\r\n     on the 28th of April, when Cortés mustered his forces. He\r\n     says nothing about the formal launch on that occasion, and\r\n     it is hardly likely that two such performances could have\r\n     been effected in one day.\r\n\r\n     [1114] ‘Las vanderas Reales, y otras vanderas del nombre\r\n     que se dezia ser el vergantin.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 138. Ixtlilxochitl assumes that the flag-ship\r\n     was named _Medellin_, _Hist. Chich._, 313-14, but this\r\n     appears to be based on a misinterpretation of Herrera, who\r\n     places Villafuerte ‘of Medellin’ at the head of the list\r\n     of captains. Vetancurt believes that the vessels were named\r\n     after the apostles, to whom Cortés was so devoted. _Teatro\r\n     Mex._, pt. iii. 156. If so, the flag-ship may have been\r\n     called _San Pedro_, after his patron. When all were floated\r\n     a storm came which threatened to break them one against\r\n     the other. _Torquemada_, i. 532.\r\n\r\n     [1115] Their names appear to have been Juan Rodriguez de\r\n     Villafuerte of Medellin, Juan Jaramillo of Salvatierra,\r\n     Francisco Rodriguez Magariño of Merida, Cristóbal Flores\r\n     of Valencia, Juan García Holguin of Cáceres, Caravajal of\r\n     Zamora, Pedro Barba of Seville, Gerónimo Ruiz de la Mota\r\n     of Búrgos, Pedro de Briones of Salamanca, Rodrigo Morejon\r\n     de Lovera of Medina del Campo, Antonio de Sotelo of Zamora,\r\n     Juan de Portillo of Portillo, and Miguel Diaz de Auz. Martin\r\n     Lopez, the ship-builder, also joined, in the character of\r\n     chief pilot. Herrera, dec. iii. lib. i. cap. xii. xxi., has\r\n     Francisco de Verdugo, of Arévalo, instead of Diaz de Auz,\r\n     but Bernal Diaz names him as one of the company captains\r\n     under Olid, and he ought to know better in this respect.\r\n     He also names a second Caravajal, Zamora, a ship-master,\r\n     afterward settled in Oajaca, Colmenero, Gines Nortes, and\r\n     Lerma. _Hist. Verdad._, 138.\r\n\r\n     [1116] The smallest was soon set aside as useless. There was\r\n     some trouble in obtaining rowers, owing in a great measure\r\n     to the employment in Spain of criminals in that capacity.\r\n     Hidalgos shrank from anything that could be regarded as\r\n     common labor, and even ordinary sailors refused to handle\r\n     a branded implement. In this dilemma a list was made of\r\n     all natives of seaports, and of those known to be able\r\n     fishermen, and finally the selected number were ordered to\r\n     take the oar, regardless of caste.\r\n\r\n     [1117] So says Cortés, _Cartas_, 208. Bernal Diaz as usual\r\n     implies a smaller number by stating that Cortés sent to ask\r\n     for only 20,000 men from the republics. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     137-8. The Cholultecs, he says, who had maintained a neutral\r\n     attitude since the massacre there, sent a small force under\r\n     their own captain. Gomara allows 60,000 allies to come;\r\n     Vetancurt 90,000, of whom 60,000 are Tlascaltecs; Clavigero\r\n     limits the arrival to 50,000 Tlascaltecs, the whole number\r\n     of allies swelling gradually to over 200,000, while Herrera\r\n     makes that number arrive within two days; Ixtlilxochitl\r\n     names thirteen chiefs, who commanded the 50,000 Tlascaltecs\r\n     (a misprint gives 5000), and some of those leading the\r\n     10,000 Huexotzincas; he also allows 10,000 Cholultecs;\r\n     of his own Tezcucans he claims over 200,000 to have come,\r\n     50,000 each being furnished by the provinces of Tezcuco,\r\n     Otumba, Tziuhcohua, and Chalco, with Tepeaca, Quauhnahuac,\r\n     etc.; 8000 chiefs or nobles joined besides from Tezcuco,\r\n     and 50,000 laborers in addition, it seems. _Hist. Chich._,\r\n     313; _Hor. Crueldades_, 20.\r\n\r\n     [1118] ‘Viua el Emperador nuestro señor, y Castilla,\r\n     Castilla, Tlascala, Tlascala!’ _Bernal Diaz_, loc. cit. It\r\n     took three days for the auxiliaries to enter, says Ojeda,\r\n     and great as was Tezcuco, there was not room for them.\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. i. cap. xii. Bernal Diaz reduces\r\n     the days to hours.\r\n\r\n     [1119] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 206. Gomara agrees, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     191, but Bernal Diaz gives the number as 84 horsemen, 650\r\n     soldiers with swords, shields, and lances, and 194 archers\r\n     and arquebusiers. loc. cit.\r\n\r\n     [1120] Some half a dozen towns furnished 8000 each within\r\n     eight days. The feathers were fastened by the archers with\r\n     glue from the _cactle_ root. They kept two strings and as\r\n     many catches, and maintained their skill by target practice.\r\n     _Id._\r\n\r\n     [1121] The distribution of forces as given by Cortés stands\r\n     thus: To Alvarado, 30 horse, 18 arquebusiers and archers,\r\n     150 sword and shield men, and over 25,000 Tlascaltecs; to\r\n     Olid, 33 horse, 18 archers and arquebusiers, 160 sword\r\n     and shield men, and over 20,000 allies; to Sandoval, 24\r\n     horse, 4 arquebusiers, 13 archers, 150 sword and shield\r\n     men, and over 30,000 allies from Huexotzinco, Cholula, and\r\n     Chalco. _Cartas_, 207. Others differ more or less, some\r\n     giving details that hardly accord with the totals. Bernal\r\n     Diaz names as Alvarado’s three captains his brother Jorge\r\n     de Alvarado, Gutierre de Badajoz, and Andrés de Monjaraz,\r\n     the latter an agreeable, bright-faced fellow of about 32\r\n     years, always suffering from a Lotharian disease which\r\n     prevented him from doing anything. The three captains under\r\n     Olid were Andrés de Tápia, a growing favorite of Cortés’,\r\n     Francisco Verdugo, the unconscious fellow-conspirator\r\n     of Villafañe, and Francisco de Lugo, the natural son of\r\n     a prominent estate-holder at Medina del Campo. Sandoval\r\n     had but two captains, the insinuating Pedro de Ircio, and\r\n     Luis Marin of San Lúcar, a muscular and dashing fellow, of\r\n     Monjaraz’ age, with an open blonde face, somewhat pitted,\r\n     and possessed of a voluble tongue. _Hist. Verdad._, 139,\r\n     240, 246. Ixtlilxochitl gives a longer list, which is\r\n     clearly wrong in many respects, and he adds some names of\r\n     native leaders. Alvarado kept the Tlascaltecs of Tizatlan\r\n     and Tepeticpac; Olid those of Ocotelulco and Quiahuiztlan.\r\n     _Hist. Chich._, 313-14. He further states that his namesake\r\n     joined Cortés’ fleet with 16,000 canoes, containing 50,000\r\n     Tezcucans, of whom 8000 were nobles. _Hor. Crueldades_, 21.\r\n     Brasseur de Bourbourg follows this author in many respects,\r\n     improving somewhat on the names. Herrera names five of the\r\n     sub-captains, among them Hernando de Lerma of Galicia. dec.\r\n     iii. lib. i. cap. xii.\r\n\r\n     [1122] ‘Iva a tomar por fuerça el Cacicazgo, e vassallos,\r\n     y tierra del mismo Chichimecatecle,’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 139, which must be an idle rumor.\r\n\r\n     [1123] Some time later when Ojeda went to Tlascala for\r\n     supplies he brought back the confiscated property, including\r\n     a quantity of treasure, and 30 women, the daughters,\r\n     servants, etc., of Xicotencatl. _Torquemada_, i. 558. The\r\n     Tlascaltec laws were severe, ‘E l’odio particolare, che\r\n     portavano a quel Principe, il cui orgoglio non potevano\r\n     più soffrire.’ _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 195. Some\r\n     Tlascaltecs say his father had warned Cortés against his\r\n     son, and urged his death. _Bernal Diaz_, loc. cit. Herrera\r\n     observes that he could hardly have been seized without\r\n     Tlascaltec aid. dec. iii. lib. i. cap. xvii.\r\n\r\n     [1124] _Ojeda_, in _Herrera_, loc. cit. Solis, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     ii. 379, thinks that it would have been hazardous to hang\r\n     him at Tezcuco, where many Tlascaltecs were gathered; but\r\n     he forgets that nearly all this people had already set\r\n     out for Mexico. His supposition is based on Bernal Diaz,\r\n     who intimates that he was not hanged in Tezcuco. Alvarado\r\n     had pleaded for his life, and Cortés, while pretending\r\n     compliance, secretly ordered the alguacil to despatch him.\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 139.\r\n\r\n     [1125] Cortés divided the lordship of the chieftain afterward\r\n     between his two sons, and the name of Xicotencatl has been\r\n     perpetuated by more than one line, as Camargo shows in\r\n     his _Hist. Tlax._ Two officers of that name figured during\r\n     the American invasion of 1847 in defence of their country.\r\n     _Brasseur de Bourbourg_, _Hist. Nat. Civ._, iv. 447.\r\n\r\n     [1126] Most writers say the 10th, misled by an error in\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 208; and this error causes Prescott,\r\n     among others, to fall into more than one mistake, which\r\n     he upholds with vain arguments. On earlier pages in the\r\n     _Cartas_ are given dates in connection with religious\r\n     festivals which show that Whitsunday fell on the 19th of\r\n     May, and the departure took place three days later. Bernal\r\n     Diaz gives the 13th, and says that the Xicotencatl affair\r\n     had detained them a day. He afterward varies the date.\r\n\r\n     [1127] They passed round Zumpango Lake, through Quauhtitlan\r\n     and Tenayocan. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 210; _Bernal Diaz_,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 139.\r\n\r\n     [1128] ‘Jamàs quisieron Paz [the Aztecs]; y aunque à\r\n     la postre la recibieron, el Rei no la aceptò, porque al\r\n     principio, contra su Consejo, la rehusaron.’ _Torquemada_,\r\n     i. 572. Gomara says the same, but Duran, the historian\r\n     of his dynasty, declares that he loved too much to rule\r\n     and to display his personal valor ever to listen to peace\r\n     proposals. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 490. On the following\r\n     pages he gives a speech by this ruler, painting the shame\r\n     and evil of surrender. Before this, according to the native\r\n     records of Sahagun, Cortés had invited Quauhtemotzin, under\r\n     promise of security, to a conference, in order to explain\r\n     his motives for the campaign. Not wishing to appear afraid,\r\n     the Aztec monarch came to the rendezvous near Acachinanco,\r\n     in a state barge, attended by several nobles. Cortés arrived\r\n     in a brigantine. He reviewed the allegiance tendered to the\r\n     Spanish sovereign, the revolt, precipitated by Alvarado’s\r\n     effort to anticipate the murderous plot, and the subsequent\r\n     slaughter of Spaniards and robbery of treasures. These\r\n     unjustifiable and inhuman outrages he had come to avenge;\r\n     and he would not stay his hand till the enemies of his king\r\n     and God had been driven forth. Quauhtemotzin merely replied\r\n     that he accepted war, and thereupon returned to the city.\r\n     _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 147-50. Torquemada,\r\n     i, 543, and Brasseur de Bourbourg adopt this story, the\r\n     latter stating that the Aztec ruler proposed to consult his\r\n     council. But Clavigero rightly assumes that the interview\r\n     never took place. All other records say that Quauhtemotzin\r\n     persistently refused ever to speak with Cortés, even from\r\n     behind his walls.\r\n\r\n     [1129] Many captives had been secured during recent raids\r\n     on Chalco and Tezcuco, and other parts, so that there was\r\n     no lack. The native victims numbered 4000, it is said.\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. i. cap. xvii. ‘All boys,’ says\r\n     Oviedo, iii. 515. ‘Yo bien creo que fuerõ muchas, mas no\r\n     tantas.’ _Gomara_, loc. cit. The limbs of the Spaniards were\r\n     sent to different provinces to frighten the inhabitants.\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 135.\r\n\r\n     [1130] Ixtlilxochitl states in one place that his namesake\r\n     remained at Tezcuco to raise troops and to arrange for\r\n     regular trains of supplies for the Spanish camps. In another\r\n     relation he allows him to accompany Cortés with 16,000\r\n     canoes. _Hor. Crueldades_, 21; _Relacion_, 314. The canoes\r\n     which now attended the fleet appear to have served chiefly\r\n     as transports.\r\n\r\n     [1131] Owned even under republican rule by the heirs of\r\n     Cortés, as a tetzontli quarry.\r\n\r\n     [1132] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 211. Bernal Diaz raises the number\r\n     to 4000, Peter Martyr to 5000, while Vetancurt assumes that\r\n     the 500 were merely the van. _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii. 158.\r\n\r\n     [1133] Oviedo writes that they were sacrificing boys to\r\n     propitiate the gods. iii. 516. ‘La flota q̄ les parecio\r\n     no dar batalla con tan pocas y cansadas,’ observes Gomara,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 194.\r\n\r\n     [1134] Alvarado advanced as far as the first wide bridge,\r\n     but lost three men. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 141.\r\n\r\n     [1135] Probably behind the great southern levee. See _Native\r\n     Races_, ii. 564.\r\n\r\n     [1136] Gomara calls it wrongly Xaltoca, and Robertson\r\n     confounds it, singularly enough, with Tezcuco. _Hist. Am._,\r\n     ii. 114.\r\n\r\n     [1137] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 216-17. The greater number of\r\n     the allies came daily from their camp at Coyuhuacan to\r\n     join Cortés as warriors and sappers. Digging and similar\r\n     work was done chiefly by Tezcucans. Herrera states that\r\n     the vessels of Flores and Ruiz de la Mota were placed at a\r\n     broken causeway between the camps of Alvarado and Sandoval.\r\n     dec. iii. lib. i. cap. xvii.\r\n\r\n     [1138] ‘Asserrador ... trabajò mas que mil Indios.’\r\n     _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. i. cap. xviii.\r\n\r\n     [1139] Only three, says Cortés and others.\r\n\r\n     [1140] Ixtlilxochitl allows his namesake and Cortés to figure\r\n     in this scene, the former cutting off the idol’s head while\r\n     the general secured the mask. He states that the temple\r\n     was captured during the first entry into the court. When\r\n     the Mexicans rallied, Ixtlilxochitl managed to kill their\r\n     general, which so enraged them that they rushed madly on\r\n     and drove back the Spaniards till the horse arrived. _Hor.\r\n     Crueldades_, 29-30. His version is adopted in the main by\r\n     Prescott and others; but there are several discrepancies.\r\n     The death of a general as a rule discouraged native armies.\r\n     Cortés, who would not have failed to claim the overthrow\r\n     of the idol, states that it was effected by four or five\r\n     Spaniards, after the second capture of the court. _Cartas_,\r\n     218. His presence was needed below to direct operations.\r\n     Gomara’s text must have misled Ixtlilxochitl and others.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 197-8. Herrera and Torquemada adhere better\r\n     to Cortés.\r\n\r\n     [1141] Cortés speaks of an ambuscade by the horsemen wherein\r\n     30 Mexicans fell. _Cartas_, 218. How many of his own were\r\n     lost he prudently abstains from mentioning, though admitting\r\n     many wounded. ‘Dexaron perdido los Españoles esta vez el\r\n     tiro grueso,’ says Torquemada, i. 548, but this is unlikely.\r\n\r\n     [1142] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 221. Bernal Diaz states that\r\n     Alvarado received four and Sandoval only two. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 141.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nCONTINUATION OF THE SIEGE.\r\n\r\nJUNE-JULY, 1521.\r\n\r\n     SOMETHING ABOUT QUAUHTEMOTZIN—INFAMOUS PRETENSIONS OF\r\n     EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION AND CHRISTIANITY—PROMPT ACTION OF THE\r\n     MEXICAN EMPEROR—REPETITIONS OF THE ENTRY ASSAULT—SUBMISSION\r\n     OF THE SURROUNDING NATIONS—DIRE CONDITION OF THE\r\n     MEXICANS—SPANISH DEFEAT AND DISAFFECTION—RESOLUTION TO RAZE\r\n     THE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their present position, with the advantages of superior\r\ncivilization, there was equal glory accruing to the Spaniards in\r\nwinning Mexico, and to the Mexicans in manfully losing their city.\r\nQuauhtemotzin as a patriot and a skilful general was fully alive to the\r\nperils of his position, but he was prepared to use to best advantage\r\nall the resources at his command, and that is all any one can do.\r\nStern as Saturnius, and passionately patient, from the day of the\r\ncapture of Montezuma his nature had been proof against all pleasure.\r\nOf an imperious temper, haughty and overbearing as Coriolanus, yet\r\nwas he as faithful to defend the city as any Hector or Horatius. I\r\nhold that Spaniards of the sixteenth century were no worse than their\r\nneighbors. It was a bigoted and cruel age; though for that matter\r\nenough of bigotry yet remains, and there is sufficient cruelty in\r\nour latter-day fightings to keep us humble. And while we see much to\r\ncondemn in the motives that brought hither these foreigners, and much\r\nin their conduct that was cruel and unjust, yet we are constrained\r\nto admit that the work which they accomplished was in the pathway of\r\ndestiny. The conquest of the county, the destruction of its barbarous\r\nand inhuman rites, and the establishment of the religion of Christ\r\nin their place were the inevitable consequences of the discovery\r\nof America. Once brought face to face with the sacrificial stone,\r\nand other brutal atrocities of the Aztecs, and Christianity had no\r\nalternative but to eradicate these evils or be itself overthrown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe victorious advance into the heart of the city had been a\r\npleasant surprise to the Spaniards, while to the Mexicans it was\r\nincomprehensible. If such were the results of the first day’s doings,\r\nwhat would the days following bring forth? Quauhtemotzin immediately\r\nissued orders to reopen the channels and construct fresh intrenchments\r\nand pitfalls. Such were the forces employed, and such their zeal,\r\nthat when the morning dawned the causeways and streets presented even\r\ngreater difficulties than before. The allies of the Mexicans were\r\nnot so easily reassured, however, and several began to waver, among\r\nthem the Xochimilcans, to the rear of Olid’s camp, who sent in their\r\nsubmission to Cortés, promising not only active aid but much needed\r\nsupplies. The same offer came from the more numerous Otomís, occupying\r\nthe western mountain border of the valley, followed by the substantial\r\nreinforcement of twenty thousand of their sturdy warriors, with large\r\nsupplies.[1143] Still larger reinforcements arrived just before these\r\nfrom Tezcuco, where ever since Cortés’ departure the young king and\r\nhis brothers had been busily engaged in forwarding supplies[1144]\r\nand fitting out troops. Fifty thousand were raised and placed under\r\nthe command of the energetic Ixtlilxochitl, who had great military\r\nreputation and possessed far more influence than his ruling brother.\r\nHe joined Cortés with thirty thousand, and distributed the rest\r\namong the other captains. Cortés praises him for his bravery and good\r\ntraits, a eulogy which serves only to embitter Mexican writers against\r\none who favored aliens against his own race, and aided to overthrow\r\ntheir liberty and religion. During the campaign he was frequently\r\ntaunted as a renegade, traitor, and fratricide, but he never swerved\r\nin his allegiance, and found ready retorts and excuses, the strongest\r\nbeing that he favored the Christians for introducing the true faith.\r\nYet this strange religion he was in no haste, personally, to adopt.\r\n“Curses on his odious memory!” exclaims the rabid Bustamante.[1145]\r\n\r\nThree days after the last assault a second was made, supported by more\r\nallies than ever. Cortés’ Spanish forces consisted of twenty horses,\r\nthree hundred infantry, with three guns. Although he had noticed the\r\noperations of the Mexicans, he was hardly prepared to find his work\r\nso completely undone. As before, each channel with its intrenchments\r\nhad to be captured anew, and while the causeway was readily gained\r\nwith the aid of brigantines, the advance along the street was slower,\r\nalthough the soldiers were somewhat less exposed to roof volleys since\r\nthe burning of so many of the buildings during the previous entry. The\r\nbreaches and channels were filled up as they advanced. In the plaza\r\nthe houses were yet intact and the missile showers severe, so much\r\nso that Cortés found it necessary to apply the torch, among others\r\nto the Axayacatl palace, his former head-quarters, wherein he had\r\nsustained so fierce a siege, and to the House of Birds, which formed\r\nso prominent and admired a feature in the city. It was of vast extent,\r\nand devoted almost wholly to the maintenance of beasts and birds of\r\nevery species, some kept in the gardens, some in courts, others in\r\ngalleries, rooms, and cages; altogether a collection which must tend\r\nto cast a favorable light on the culture of the race. Both palaces\r\nwere splendid specimens of Nahua architecture, adorned with marble\r\ngalleries supported on monolith pillars, with elaborate cornices\r\nand stucco work, and surmounted by turrets and battlements, while\r\nwithin and around rose groves of rare trees, choice shrubbery, and\r\nflowers, refreshed by ever sparkling fountains. Cortés had rightly\r\nconcluded that the destruction of such monuments, cherished not alone\r\nfor their beauty and contents but for their hallowed associations,\r\nwould be a more severe lesson than the loss of numerous lives; and as\r\nthe flames rose over all that vast area, fed by the roofs, interior\r\nwood-work, and other combustible material, lamentations mingled with\r\nthe maddened cries of burning animals. Around in the suburbs, also,\r\ncould be seen column after column of dense smoke started by the\r\ntorches of the cruisers, and settling in dense masses over the city\r\nas if threatening to bury her forever from sight. Fortunately for the\r\ninhabitants, the houses thereabout were too wide apart to allow the\r\nflames to spread far. Even at this juncture the work of destruction\r\nmight have been stopped for the reason that Cyrus stopped the sack of\r\nSardis when Crœsus said to him: “These are not my goods, but thine,\r\nO Cyrus, that thou art spoiling!”\r\n\r\nAll this time waged the conflict of arms, the Mexicans seeking by\r\nrepeated charges and sallies to check the advance of the Spaniards\r\nand to harass them. The native chronicles relate that during one of\r\nthe countercharges by the cavalry a horseman pierced a warrior with\r\nsuch force that the lance remained fast in the ground. Regarding\r\nit as a disgrace to abandon his weapon he rashly dismounted to\r\nunfasten it, only to be surrounded by the foe and cut in pieces. His\r\ncomrades hastened to the rescue, but could recover only the mangled\r\nremains.[1146]\r\n\r\nWhen evening came and the signal was given for return to camp, the\r\nMexicans fell upon the rear with renewed ardor. It seems as if courage\r\ncame to them in proportion to their misfortunes. For their fury broke\r\nforth anew, fed by the dire conditions round them, by the sight of\r\nlately enslaved Otomís, Xochimilcans, and Chalcans, now fighting\r\nagainst them under the sheltering wings of the invaders, and exulting\r\nover their misfortunes with bitter taunts. “Behold!” they cried,\r\ndisplaying dismembered limbs of Aztecs, “we shall fill our bellies\r\nwith your braves, and have enough over wherewith to feed the beasts.\r\nDo not starve yourselves, for to-morrow we will return for more.”\r\n“And in truth they both supped and breakfasted on the limbs,” says\r\nCortés.[1147] Camp was regained without serious trouble.\r\n\r\nThe following day the entry was repeated, and early as it was, the\r\nchannels had been nearly all reopened and provided with the usual\r\nintrenchments. This involved a repetition of the previous day’s\r\nmanœuvres, but the Mexicans fought with greater obstinacy, partly\r\nbecause they had become accustomed to the Spanish tactics, and it was\r\none o’clock before the plaza was reached, by which time the archers\r\nand arquebusiers had exhausted their quivers and ammunition-pouches.\r\nCortés now advanced beyond the temple along the Tlacopan road, well\r\nknown to the veterans from the hard fighting there met during the\r\nprevious siege, and captured two canal crossings, which were filled\r\nup, while to the buildings on either side the torch was applied.\r\nThe object of the movement was partly to open intercourse with\r\nAlvarado’s forces, which were advancing less rapidly, owing to the\r\nnumber of intrenched channels. Progress was slowly increased during\r\nthe succeeding entries, when Andrés de Tápia and Ávila pushed along\r\nadjoining streets with detachments.[1148]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne result of the Spanish successes was the submission of all the\r\nthreatening and neutral lake and island towns to the south and\r\nsouth-west of Mexico, from Iztapalapan and Culhuacan to Cuitlahuac.\r\nTo this step they had been partly impelled by the repeated raids of\r\nthe Chalcan confederates, and since their submission was so tardy they\r\nwere employed chiefly as laborers and purveyors. Gomara now estimates\r\nthe native auxiliaries at two hundred thousand men, “some engaged\r\nintent on fighting, some on eating, some on stealing, and many on\r\ngazing.”[1149] These lake peoples, known as Chinampanecs, from their\r\nfloating gardens and aquatic life, possessed canoes in abundance, and\r\nCortés availed himself of this to reënforce the blockading fleet with\r\na boat flotilla, three thousand in all, which harassed the city on\r\nevery side, entering into the canals to burn and pillage, and landing\r\nsallying parties to carry desolation all through the suburbs.\r\n\r\nAllured by the prospect of spoils, the Chinampanec crews arranged\r\na plan whereby a still richer draught might be made. Before their\r\nadhesion to the Spanish cause, or knowledge of it had yet come to\r\nQuauhtemotzin, they sent to offer him their services against the\r\ninvaders, with whom they proposed to deal treacherously. They were\r\nassigned a post and played their part well. No sooner were the Mexicans\r\noccupied with the Spanish forces than they rushed into the dwellings\r\nof their pretended allies and began to rob, slay, and carry off\r\nwomen and children. An alarm was given and reënforcements hurried up\r\nwhich speedily overwhelmed the traitorous crews, killing a number,\r\ncapturing others, and recovering nearly all the booty. The captives\r\nwere condemned to the stone of sacrifice, those of Cuitlahuac by one\r\nof their own caciques, Mayehuatzin, a companion of Quauhtemotzin.\r\nThe incident cost many lives on both sides, greatly to the delight\r\nof the Spaniards, to whom this mutual throat-cutting was the economy\r\nof war.[1150]\r\n\r\nWith so large a hostile fleet upon the lake the Mexican crews never\r\nventured abroad by day, but when darkness set in, their canoes\r\nsped across, impelled by the demand for food. Informed of this,\r\nCortés detached two brigantines, under Portillo and Pedro Barba, to\r\ncruise all night. This proved a severe blow to the poor Mexicans,\r\nalthough a number of canoes still ran the blockade successfully,\r\nand it was resolved to entrap the vessels, since open battle could\r\nnot avail against them. Thirty of the largest canoes, or piraguas,\r\nwere accordingly manned with stout warriors and strong boatmen, and\r\nhidden amongst the rushes near a heavily staked channel, into which\r\nsome swift canoes were to decoy the brigantines. This succeeded, and\r\nno sooner were they fast on the stakes than the canoes attacked them\r\nwith such spirit that every Spaniard was wounded, while Portillo fell,\r\nand Barba died within three days.[1151] The brigantines managed to\r\nescape. Encouraged by this attempt the Mexicans became more brisk\r\nin their blockade-running, and stationed forty piraguas to repeat\r\nthe decoy surprise. Advised of this by two captives, Cortés sent six\r\nbrigantines by night to hide near the spot, leaving one to cruise\r\nabout for canoes. Some of these soon appeared, and the sailor pursued\r\nthem for a distance toward the hiding-place of the Mexicans. Suddenly\r\nshe turned about as if afraid of stakes. Observing this, the forty\r\npiraguas ventured forth and were allured toward the Spanish ambuscade.\r\nAt the proper moment the six vessels came down upon the pursuers,\r\noverturning and sinking a number, and capturing others, together with\r\nmany warriors. The Mexicans attempted no further naval surprises.[1152]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the night cruisers and the Chinampanecs, supplies were nearly all\r\ncut off, and gaunt hunger began to stalk the streets of the fated\r\ncapital. The ravages of the fleet and the flotilla along the eastern\r\nsuburbs had rendered these wholly untenable, and the south-eastern\r\ndistrict had been desolated by Cortés’ divisions, compelling the\r\ninhabitants to abandon the greater part of Tenochtitlan and concentrate\r\nchiefly in Tlatelulco. These two main divisions of the city had been\r\nrivals ever since its foundation, with frequent disputes to sustain\r\nthe flame of discord. Gradually the Tenochtitlans had assumed the\r\nsway, honored by imperial presence, while the other division had\r\nassumed a plebeian stamp, patronized by the former. During this common\r\nmisfortune, however, rivalry was forgotten, and the more warlike\r\nTlatelulcans unhesitatingly aided the others and now welcomed them\r\ninto their quarter.[1153]\r\n\r\nEvery loss of allies to the Mexicans was a corresponding gain to the\r\nSpaniards, less in regard to fresh auxiliaries than to the relief from\r\nhostile attitude and to supplies. The Chinampanecs, for instance, were\r\nordered to bring material and construct barracks along the causeway\r\non either side of Fort Xoloc. These afforded shelter for all the\r\nSpaniards and two thousand servants, and proved most welcome, for\r\nthe rainy season had already set in. The same natives were obliged\r\nto provide supplies, such as fish and a species of cherry, which\r\ntogether with maize formed the chief sustenance of the army. Frijoles,\r\nor beans, cacao, _quilite_ herbs, and _nochtli_, afforded variety.\r\nThe maize was ground by hand and made into tortillas, or pancakes,\r\nby the slave women and mistresses of the soldiers, either for their\r\nindividual lords or for the mess to which they belonged. These duties\r\nwere also assumed by some of the few Spanish and mulatto women who\r\nhad accompanied their husbands. Although there was little fear of\r\nstarvation in the Spanish camps, yet the fare was at times not of\r\nthe best.[1154] The less fastidious auxiliaries were content with\r\na range of eatables which the soldiers would not touch; human meat\r\nwith them was a _bonne-bouche_ for which they were prepared to risk\r\neven their own flesh.[1155] Alvarado’s men enjoyed perhaps the least\r\ncomfort, for they had moved their camp to a point on the causeway,\r\nleaving the auxiliaries at Tlacopan, together with the slaves and\r\ntortilla-makers. Nor were their barracks properly constructed, so\r\nthat exposure to wind and rain was added to poor fare and miry roads,\r\nwhile the situation of the camp added to danger and guard duty.\r\n\r\nThe camp had been formed round a temple square on the causeway, quite\r\nclose to Mexico, or rather to Tlatelulco, for Alvarado had tired\r\nof having his day’s work destroyed every night, and he resolved at\r\nleast to protect the approach to the suburb. One deep channel yet\r\nintervened, beyond which the camp could not well be moved, but a\r\nlarge force was stationed to guard it at night, so that the crossing\r\nshould be assured for the morning’s attack.[1156] On the other side\r\ngleamed the watch-fires of the Mexicans, behind and between which\r\nmight be seen the flitting figures of their warriors, signalling to\r\none another by whistling. This and other operations were forced upon\r\nthem to a great extent by Spanish tactics, from which they had copied\r\nmany features with no little effect.\r\n\r\nFrom Alvarado’s camp to the Tlatelulco market, the heart of the\r\nenemy’s stronghold, the distance was less than from the camp of\r\nCortés, though the first part of the way was more difficult than\r\nthe Iztapalapan road. The immense stride of the Fort Xoloc party\r\nhad wholly eclipsed the progress of the others, and Alvarado’s men\r\nbegan to fear that, near as they were to the enemy’s centre, the\r\nmore distant comrades might reach it before them. It was therefore\r\nresolved to make strenuous efforts to penetrate into the suburb. The\r\nassault being on Tlatelulco itself, the Mexicans found no difficulty\r\nin offering so strong a resistance that hardly any advance could\r\nbe made. Several vessels were thereupon directed against the suburb\r\nto coöperate with a brisk fire, and to divert attention by landing\r\nsallying parties. This succeeded for a while, but inspired by the\r\nprowess of two Tlatelulcans named Tzoyetzin and Temoctzin, the warriors\r\nrallied and drove back the invaders. Another brave who distinguished\r\nhimself during the repulse was Tzilacatzin. In the guise of an Otomí\r\nwarrior, and protected by cotton armor and shield, he rushed toward\r\nthe Spaniards as if bewildered, in advance of his comrades, and threw\r\nhis stone, knocking down an opponent at each throw. This man appeared\r\nin different guise on different days, and did no little to encourage\r\nhis companions.[1157]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these rebuffs Alvarado persevered, and the Mexicans\r\nresolved to take advantage of his zeal to entrap him. Two or three\r\nwide channels intervened between the end of the causeway and the\r\ngreat market, and the first of these was now the point of contention,\r\na chasm of sixty feet in width and over ten feet in depth. By great\r\neffort a crossing had here been formed with débris. This the Mexicans\r\nundermined one night and covered a part with a false ground. In the\r\nmorning they attacked the Spanish outpost with great demonstration,\r\nbut retired as soon as the horsemen charged. Flushed with success, the\r\nSpaniards followed in divided parties, and one of fifty with a number\r\nof allies pursued across the channel. No sooner were they over than\r\nthe boatmen below tore away the support, while the warriors turned\r\nwith overwhelming force upon the band. Resistance was impossible,\r\nand they retreated only to fall into the opening, where crews were at\r\nhand to pounce upon them. Indescribable confusion ensued. Thick fell\r\nthe blows off the despairing men, as they sought to beat back the\r\ntriumphant foe. Bernal Diaz, who was among the number trapped, felt\r\nhimself seized by stout arms, but although badly wounded he managed\r\nto cast off the assailant and spring to the bank, where he fell\r\nexhausted. Fortunately Alvarado came up at this moment, after driving\r\nback a division in another direction, and so startled the assailants\r\nthat they retreated, though with four captive Spaniards, one or two\r\nmore being killed, besides a horse and a number of allies.[1158]\r\n\r\nWhen Cortés heard of the affair he came over to administer a reprimand,\r\nbut on learning the particulars he could not withhold his admiration\r\nfor the valiant deeds performed, and merely exhorted his lieutenant to\r\nbe more cautious.[1159] Great was the exultation of the Mexicans over\r\ntheir success, and tauntingly they hovered round the camp, imitating\r\nthe cries of the entrapped soldiers. So encouraged did they feel as\r\nto make several determined night attacks on the different camps or\r\ntheir advance posts. Alvarado’s being nearest and most exposed had\r\nto sustain quite a severe fight, losing several men.[1160]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough Alvarado had made little advance into the city, the planting\r\nof his camp so near it saved much fighting and enabled him to direct\r\ndaily operations almost at once against the main points. In this\r\nhe possessed an advantage over Cortés, who was compelled daily to\r\nrecapture a number of positions already gained. He himself remarks on\r\nthis loss of time and work. “Your Majesty may blame me for retreating\r\ninstead of holding what is gained,” he writes, but guards at the\r\nbridges, which must be large, would be so harassed as to unfit them\r\nfor the next day’s work, while to take up a position within the city\r\nwould draw the whole of the large population upon them, and might lead\r\nto the cutting off of communication and supplies, and probably to a\r\nrepetition of the great disaster of the previous year. Such a position\r\nwould besides render it possible for the Mexicans to obtain supplies\r\nfrom the mainland, for the Spanish allies could not be relied on to\r\nwatch them. Cortés’ own officers, however, could not fail to observe\r\nthat Alvarado’s course might have been followed with some advantage.\r\nThey began to tire of the slow progress, attended as it was with so\r\nmuch fighting for so little gain; so much exposure to alternate rain\r\nand heat; so much discomfort in rude camps with poor diet and want of\r\nproper care for wounded or sick men. This was represented to Cortés,\r\nwith the request that a general storming be attempted with a view\r\nto abbreviate the siege. He represented the danger of advancing over\r\nso many channels, along streets lined with houses, against hosts of\r\ndetermined warriors, with the prospect of being caught in the rear.\r\nStill he was as eager as any one to end the siege, and would call a\r\ncouncil to deliberate on the matter. The result was a decided majority\r\nfor the proposition to attempt the capture of Tlatelulco market and\r\nthere establish a permanent camp.[1161]\r\n\r\nSince Sandoval will not be able to render efficient service on his\r\nroute for an attack on Tlatelulco, he is ordered to join Alvarado\r\nwith the weightiest part of his forces, and to take advantage of the\r\nmovement to entrap the Mexicans. He will pretend to make a general\r\nevacuation of his camp, and thus allure the foe to an attack on the\r\nbaggage-train, during which the ambuscaded cavalry can inflict a\r\nlesson which shall also serve to secure the camp against later attack.\r\nSandoval sends another portion of his forces to Cortés, who has more\r\npoints to cover, and receives instructions to attend in particular\r\nto the capture of the channels and their filling, and otherwise to\r\nsecure the safety of the more impetuous Alvarado.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed, the brigantines with their flotillas are sent\r\nearly to aid in clearing the causeways and approaches. The troops\r\nfind little trouble in reaching the Tlacopan avenue, from which three\r\nlong roads give access to the market. It is advantageous to push the\r\nadvance on each of these, and three divisions are accordingly formed,\r\none to follow the main street under command of the comptroller and\r\ntreasurer, Julian de Alderete, who has been among the foremost to\r\nurge the assault; another under Andrés de Tápia and Jorge de Alvarado,\r\nbrother of the Tlacopan leader, both dashing and able men; the third\r\nand somewhat larger body, swelled particularly by auxiliaries, Cortés\r\nhimself directs along the most dangerous approach, a sort of causeway,\r\nlined with houses but bordered with water.[1162] Two cannon are placed\r\non the Tlacopan road, guarded by eight horsemen, and Cortés leaves\r\nhis horse at the entrance of the road taken by him, and gives strict\r\norders to all captains for filling every channel behind them.\r\n\r\nCortés at first leads his men on foot, and with the aid of a\r\nfield-piece readily gains the first bridge and barricade, carrying\r\nall before him, while the auxiliaries swarm into the houses and\r\ndrive slingers and archers from the roofs. The determination of the\r\nassaulting party seems to have disheartened the Mexicans, for the\r\nadvance is quite rapid, so much so that the captain who has taken\r\nCortés’ place at the head of his division soon reports that he is\r\napproaching the market and can hear the operations of Alvarado\r\nand Sandoval. May he advance? This message reaches Cortés on a\r\nsection of his causeway to the rear, where he has remained to gain\r\na contested point, and to oppose assaults from the cross-streets.\r\nHe replies that the captain must first secure his rear and flanks,\r\nand look particularly to the channels, of which there are three\r\nin that causeway. “They are filled,” was the answer, made without\r\na thought as to its accuracy, for flushed with the success of the\r\nadvance, soldiers and cavaliers alike cast prudence to the winds,\r\nand disregarding common ditches bend their eyes alone upon the goal.\r\nImmediately after comes the doleful sound of the _teponastli_, and\r\na shrill trumpet blast, the alarm signal of Paynalton, the mythic\r\npage of the war-god. Struck on the summit of Tlatelulco temple, the\r\nsounds float over the contestants, sending a chill into the heart\r\nof the Spaniards and allies as they rush onward filled with visions\r\nof success. To the Mexicans, on the other hand, it comes as a magic\r\nappeal from Huitzilopochtli, stirring their spirit with fresh energy:\r\na resistless appeal to make a supreme effort for imperilled home,\r\nand faith, and liberty.[1163]\r\n\r\nCortés also hears the warning, only too deeply impressed since that\r\nSorrowful Night, and with anxious heart he hastens forward to see how\r\nmatters stand. His anxiety is increased as the jubilant cries of his\r\nown men appear to change, while high above them rise the unmistakably\r\ntriumphant shouts of the Aztecs. Just then he comes to one of the\r\ncrossings formed by his party at a channel ten to twelve paces wide,\r\nand over ten feet deep. It seems insecure, and on looking he finds it\r\nconstructed of some loosely thrown pieces of wood and reed, covered\r\nwith a little earth. He at once orders the auxiliaries in his following\r\nto rebuild the structure. Scarcely is the order uttered before he\r\nsees his forces coming down the causeway in disorderly flight, led\r\nby the allies. Cortés makes frantic efforts to stay the current. None\r\nheed him. Fears lend wings and drown all appeal. On come the pressing\r\nthrong, on to the frail bridge, which sinks with its living freight\r\ninto the deep water. Still onward rush the mass behind, impelled by\r\ntheir mad momentum, tumbling on the heads of these, scrambling and\r\nwading, adding their cries for help to the shrieks of despair beneath,\r\nwhile from the rear roll the terrifying shouts of hot pursuers. Already\r\nthe house-tops teem with slingers and archers; the lanes pour forth\r\ntheir warriors with swords and long pikes to pierce the flanks, and\r\nthe canals are alive with canoes whose crews secure the struggling\r\nfugitives for sacrifice, or deal the more grateful _coup de grace_.\r\nThe Spanish soldiers are among the last to come up, and a terrible\r\ngauntlet they have had to run. Regardless of the showering missiles\r\nor the pressing foe, Cortés stands on the brink to strike back the\r\nhungry crew and lend a helping hand to his floundering men. “I was\r\ndetermined to remain there and die fighting,” he writes. But so many\r\nare beyond his reach, and there he must stand helpless to watch the\r\nstruggle; to behold now this soldier felled, now the other carried\r\noff; and more, to see the banner torn from the hands of his alférez.\r\n_Tlapanecatl_ is the name given by the records to the doughty captor\r\nof so esteemed a prize.\r\n\r\nStanding there conspicuously on the brink, Cortés becomes the target\r\nfor hundreds of missiles, though protected by his mail; but soon the\r\nfoe begin to press round him, and even in his rear, separating him from\r\nthe men.[1164] The next moment more than one pair of arms had coiled\r\nround his body, and, with triumphant shouts of “Malinche! Malinche!”\r\nthey seek to drag him into the water to the canoes. Alarmed by the\r\noutcry, his body-soldier, Cristóbal de Olea, hastens to his side, and\r\nwith a sabre-blow severs the arm which was well nigh pulling over the\r\nbent form of his master. The next instant he himself falls beneath the\r\nfurious onslaught roused by the magnitude of the prize, “a glorious\r\ndeath in so good a cause!” exclaims Herrera. Another soldier, named\r\nLerma, rushes to the spot and is nearly overpowered; while a stout\r\nTlascaltec, Temacatzin, plants himself in front of the leader, half\r\nprostrate with exhaustion and wounds, and wards off the blows till\r\nAntonio de Quiñones, captain of the guard, manages to force his way\r\nforward and sustains him, followed by a number of men whom the report\r\nof their general’s danger has stirred to fierceness.[1165] “Away\r\nfrom here, your worship, and save your person,” cries the captain,\r\n“for without you all will be lost!” Cortés refuses, “for I desired\r\nrather death than life,” he writes; but finally by dint of pleading\r\nand main force he is induced slowly to retire, seeking to cover the\r\nrear of the fleeing. And well it was, for a longer stay would have\r\nproved fatal. But for the eagerness of the Mexicans to secure as\r\nprisoner so magnificent a prize, they could easily have despatched\r\nhim. Aztecs made it a point to obtain as many prisoners as possible,\r\nparticularly chiefs and nobles, and white men, who ranked even above\r\nthese, in order to do honor to the war-god. This effort was prompted\r\nby a deep religious obligation as well as by warrior spirit.\r\n\r\nNot far from the disastrous channel a horse was brought, upon which\r\nCortés was mounted, though wounded in the leg. Shortly before, his\r\nchamberlain, Cristóbal de Guzman, a great favorite, had ridden up\r\nwith a charger to the relief of his master, only to be surrounded with\r\nwarriors and cut down, together with the animal,[1166] while another\r\nrider was obliged to retreat with a lance-thrust in the throat. On\r\nretiring from the section of causeway assigned to the horse, another\r\nanimal was killed and a third narrowly escaped. Finally the troops\r\nreached the broader Tlacopan road, and now Cortés, with the nine\r\nhorsemen left in his division, was able to take a firm stand against\r\nthe enemy. Checked in their pursuit, and made timid in their charges\r\nby the presence of the bold line of horses and lances, they flung\r\ntheir missiles and insults with increased energy. Suddenly two or\r\nthree Spanish heads were cast before the horsemen, with the cry:\r\n“Tonatiuh!” “Sandoval!” The meaning could not be misunderstood, and\r\nas the Spaniards gazed on the gory and disfigured faces a sickening\r\nfear crept over them. Could it be that these beloved leaders had\r\nfallen! There was no time for deliberation. Finding his own party now\r\ncomparatively secure, Cortés hurriedly sent messengers to recall the\r\nother divisions under Alderete and Tápia.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly need for this message. The triumphant shouts of\r\nthe Mexicans in pursuit of the troops of Cortés and the increased\r\nattack on their own had already warned these leaders. Still they\r\npersevered, although their men manifested some discouragement. It\r\nwas not long, however, before two or three mutilated, bearded heads\r\nwere cast before them with the cry, “Malinche is dead!” “Tonatiuh and\r\nall their men have fallen!” The leaders saw that farther advance was\r\nuseless, especially since the Mexicans now attacked with great fury.\r\nThe leaders kept their men in good order, and were already retiring\r\nwhen the order of recall reached them. The streets there being wider\r\nand easier, and the channels all filled, they found no trouble in\r\nrejoining their general. Now jointly they retreated through the plaza\r\nand down the Iztapalapan road, furiously pursued by the warriors,\r\nwho showed themselves more reckless than usual on seeing their prey\r\nescape. The central temple was filling with a vast throng to watch\r\nthe onslaught, and on the summit the priests were already burning\r\nincense and chanting in honor of victory, while the rabble railed at\r\nthe humiliated children of the sun.\r\n\r\nAlvarado had meanwhile advanced along the road to Tlatelulco from\r\nhis causeway, leaving Sandoval to coöperate along the flank and\r\nto direct the movements of the brigantines and the filling of the\r\nchannels. The advance was fiercely resisted by the Mexicans from roofs,\r\ncross-lanes, and barricades, and hundreds had been severely wounded,\r\nchiefly Tlascaltecs, only too many fatally, yet he persevered. He\r\nwas already near the market, the aim of all efforts, when the drum\r\nand trumpet came to startle his men and to encourage the Mexicans to\r\ngreater resistance. Progress was now almost checked, and soon came\r\nthe cry, “Malinche is dead!” “Sandoval and the other captains are\r\ndead!” “Behold their faces!” And therewith several heads with gory\r\nbeards were cast before them. “This shall be your fate!”\r\n\r\nAlvarado’s men were white with dismay, and but for the intrepid\r\ncourage of their leader the rout of Cortés’ party might have been\r\nrepeated. Making a bold stand with his Spaniards, he ordered the\r\nTlascaltecs to fall back and leave the retreat open. They needed no\r\nsecond instructions to this end, for the bleeding heads lent wings\r\nto their haste. Then grew the onslaught fiercer than ever, for the\r\nretreat of Cortés’ forces enabled a larger number of enemies to turn\r\nagainst Alvarado and Sandoval. The latter also received his cast of\r\nbloody heads with a new string of prominent names, all calculated to\r\ninspire terror. “By this time they had us all killed,” adds Bernal\r\nDiaz, “but, in truth, we were all wounded, and filled with anguish\r\nconcerning the fate of our chief. Without God’s aid we could never\r\nhave escaped from the swords and clutches of the Mexicans.” Some\r\npious chroniclers, indeed, assert as usual that the virgin appeared\r\nin person, together with perennial Santiago, to save the Spaniards\r\nfrom their greatest peril.[1167]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the victories on land, the Mexicans had ventured forth\r\nalso in their canoes to harass the vessels which were occupied in\r\nprotecting the retreat of the armies. Unable in some instances to\r\nleave their position, or impeded in their movement by stakes and other\r\nobstacles, many of the brigantines were severely pressed, and one,\r\ncommanded by Briones, in Alvarado’s division, was actually captured,\r\nwith the loss of four men, one being taken alive. Jaramillo came to the\r\nrelief of the vessel, however, drove forth the enemy, and kept them\r\nat bay.[1168] By this time both the forces of Alvarado and Sandoval\r\nhad reached the causeway, pursued by a great host, reckless in their\r\nendeavor to inflict all the injury possible ere the Spaniards escaped.\r\nSome delay occurred in crossing the only partly filled channel to the\r\ncauseway, and a number of soldiers were detained waist-deep in water,\r\nseeking to lift a brigantine over the stakes, for the auxiliaries\r\nwere already away from the front; and all this time the cavalry were\r\ncompelled to remain before the causeway to cover the infantry and\r\nbear the brunt of the terrible onslaught. Charge after charge they\r\nmade to keep back the advancing foe, through the shower of blinding\r\nmissiles, against the line of bristling lances, amidst the whirling\r\nswords and clubs, until not a rider but felt his arm droop and his\r\nbody grow faint with loss of blood. Sandoval himself had a number\r\nof wounds. “For God’s sake make haste and retire,” he cried to his\r\nfoot-soldiers, “or we shall all be lost!”\r\n\r\nFinally the passage was clear, and they fell back along the causeway,\r\nstill fighting, and now exposed to the canoe sallies. On reaching\r\nhis quarters, Alvarado turned two cannon against the swarm which\r\nsought to scale the camp, and this with the fusillade procured a much\r\nneeded respite.[1169] It was time, for the increasing darkness would\r\nsoon have added fresh dangers to the retreat. Sandoval had already\r\nhurried away with a solitary companion to seek the camp of Cortés and\r\ncalm his fears.[1170] With a similar object Andrés de Tápia had been\r\nsent with three horsemen from Fort Xoloc to Alvarado’s camp, where\r\nhe arrived with some scars from marauding stragglers. Not wishing to\r\ndiscourage the soldiers, he reduced the losses of his party to quite\r\na small number, and made light of the matter.\r\n\r\nBy this time the enemy had retired, but from the city rose their shouts\r\nof triumph, and every temple was ablaze with fires to celebrate the\r\nvictory. The summit of the Tlatelulco pyramid, the highest of them\r\nall, was the scene of great commotion, and soon the sombre notes of\r\nthe melancholy drum called it to attention. A number of instruments\r\nnow added their discordant notes, in clash and blast, and a procession\r\nwith torches, swinging censers, and religious paraphernalia circled\r\nround with imposing ceremony. Then a space was cleared, and a long file\r\nof naked men stood revealed. A cry of horror burst from the gazing\r\nsoldiers. There could be no mistake. Distant as was the temple, the\r\nglare of fire clearly revealed the white hue and bearded faces of\r\ntheir comrades, bound for sacrifice, and plumed. Now they were made\r\nto march forward, and with blows to dance before the idol to whom\r\nthey had been consecrated. Ah, to be a helpless looker-on at such a\r\ntime! Again they formed in line exhausted, and then one was seized by\r\nseveral priests and borne struggling to the stone of sacrifice. He was\r\nthrown on his back and held down by the limbs while the high-priest\r\nwith ceremonious flourish raised the glittering blade. The gazing\r\nsoldiers clutched each other’s hands in agony, as their eyes followed\r\nthe instrument and saw it plunged into the breast of the victim.\r\nThey seemed to hear his stifled cry, to feel the knife in their own\r\nheart, and realizing that they were still safe they thanked heaven\r\nfor their escape.[1171]\r\n\r\nVictim after victim was carried to the stone, some with frantic\r\nstruggles, others resigned, and still others weighed down in helpless\r\nfear of what they had beheld. Heart after heart was torn from the\r\ngaping breasts and held before the idol, while the bodies were cast\r\ndown the steps. The skin, particularly of the head and upper body,\r\nwas removed and used as a dress for festive occasion, and the flesh\r\nwas hacked to pieces, the limbs for the banquet table, the trunk\r\nfor the beasts. After a while came darker-hued victims, and now\r\nthe Tlascaltecs and other allies shuddered. To them the sacrifices\r\nwere not so terrifying as to the Spaniards, but they could not\r\nunmoved behold the cruel death of their countrymen. Then came more\r\nprocessions, music, and idolatrous rites, followed by fresh companies\r\nfor the sacrifice, white and dark; and so passed the night, until the\r\nhorror palled on the gazers, and many expressed the opinion that the\r\npriests were pretending sacrifice by producing the same bodies upon\r\nthe stone several times so as to inspire greater fear. This belief\r\nwas strengthened when they observed similar ceremonies take place on\r\nother minor temples, and by the continuance of the sacrifices for\r\nseveral days. The offering at the minor temples consisted chiefly\r\nof the lower class of allies. All the pyramids, however, received\r\na quota of heads from Spanish, leading native, and equine victims,\r\nwherewith to decorate their summits.[1172]\r\n\r\nAware that the sight of the sacrifice, purposely intensified for\r\nSpanish edification, must have stirred deeply the breasts of the\r\nsurvivors, the Mexicans took advantage of this to attack the camp of\r\nAlvarado during the night. “Behold the fate in store for you all!”\r\nthey cried, casting in half-roasted pieces of flesh from white and\r\ndusky bodies. “Eat, for we are satiated!” The Spaniards were too well\r\nprepared to suffer from the assault, but it added to their sorrows.\r\nThe lesson had been costly, for about sixty men were lost, with six\r\nhorses, one gun, and a number of small-arms, while the ranks of the\r\nallies had been diminished by from one to two thousand, and this\r\nwithout reckoning the vast number of wounded.[1173]\r\n\r\nWhen Sandoval reached Camp Xoloc and learned the news he burst forth,\r\n“Señor Capitan, what is this? Where are the fine counsels and warlike\r\nskill which you are wont to exhibit?” With tears springing to his\r\neyes, Cortés replied: “Sandoval, my son, my sins I admit, but I am not\r\nso guilty in this matter as I appear. The officer whom I charged to\r\nfill the channel failed to obey.” He further intimated that Alvarado\r\nmight be led by his daring into difficulties, and bade Sandoval\r\nwatch carefully over the safety of the western and northern camps,\r\nparticularly for the present, while Cortés was restrained by his\r\nwounds.[1174] The injunction was needful in view of the reoccupation by\r\nthe Mexicans of the channels from which they had lately been driven,\r\nand their harassing attacks, chiefly by night, against the camps and\r\nfleets. Alvarado’s camp, as the nearest to the city, was the most\r\nexposed, and Sandoval with his tried prudence could be best relied\r\non to counteract the recklessness of its commander in repelling these\r\nattacks. Knowing the signal for the sallies, usually a shot, the enemy\r\nwere warned in time to retire, or to form some trap or combination;\r\nso that the charge of the soldiers carried little advantage.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, it is related, a shield-bearer named Peinado stepped\r\noutside the camp gate and found himself surrounded by a horde of\r\nmarauders. Escape was cut off. In this dilemma he began to rattle\r\nhis shield and sword, and shout, looking at the same time toward the\r\ncamp. The enemy assumed at once that he was signalling to some party\r\nin ambush, and beat a hasty retreat.[1175] For several days[1176] the\r\nSpaniards remained inactive. During this time the Mexicans continued\r\ntheir daily sacrifice of captives, with conspicuous rites and loud\r\ndemonstrations.\r\n\r\nAs usual amidst trying scenes, there were here examples of the\r\ndevotedness of woman. In one of the encounters on the causeway to\r\ndrive back the prowling Mexicans, Beatriz Bermudez de Velasco, wife\r\nof Francisco de Olmos, accompanied the soldiers, in cotton armor, and\r\nwith sword and shield. Such was the pressure of the enemy that the\r\ntroops were thrown into disorder and began to turn in flight. With\r\nraised sword she planted herself in their path and cried, “Shame upon\r\nyou, Castilians! turn at once against this vile rabble, for I will\r\nkill any man who attempts to pass this way.” So abashed were the men\r\nby this resolute demeanor that they again fell upon the Mexicans and\r\ndefeated them.[1177] Other women of less valor did equally good service\r\nas sisters of mercy, to tend and cheer the many disabled. One, named\r\nIsabel de Rodriguez, attained quite a reputation in curing wounds,\r\na success attributed chiefly to her holy invocation, for in applying\r\nthe bandage she invariably uttered the formula, “In the name of the\r\nfather, the son, and the holy ghost, one true God; may he cure and\r\nrestore thee!”[1178]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCortés found it absolutely necessary to resume operations in order\r\nto prevent the utter demoralization of his men, although they could\r\nadvance no farther than the last canal on the Iztapalapan road, which\r\nwas strongly fortified to protect the plaza. On the Tlatelulco side\r\nthe channel separating the city from the causeway had been reopened\r\nas a barrier. No serious effort was made to pass these points, and\r\nthe movements were effected with the greatest prudence possible.\r\n\r\nFor this caution several reasons existed, based on momentous\r\nconsequences of the late defeat. In their exultation the Mexicans\r\nhad imprudently published the oracular utterance that within eight\r\ndays the Spaniards would be destroyed, though many Aztecs would also\r\nperish.[1179] Care was taken that this divine proclamation should\r\nbe known in the Spanish camps, with the intent of disheartening the\r\nallies and procuring their desertion. This main object accomplished,\r\nit was hoped that neighboring districts might be again persuaded to\r\njoin in hostile operations, or at least assume a neutral attitude\r\nagainst the isolated Spaniards. Severely harassed by all the strength\r\nof the capital and its allies, the Spaniards would be unable to\r\nmaintain the siege or even to sustain their own position, particularly\r\nif supplies were cut off, and so be obliged to retreat. Many indeed\r\nlooked upon the Spaniards as doomed, and tired besides of the long\r\nsiege, so contrary to native ideas of warfare, corps after corps of\r\ntheir allies disappeared, in secret retreat to their homes. Others\r\nwere sufficiently shaken in their belief to lose all ardor, the more\r\nso when they recalled the prophecy of disaster uttered by the hanged\r\nXicotencatl. Cortés and his officers did all they could to counteract\r\nthis influence by referring to previous failures of oracles, to\r\nthe comparatively small percentage of the late losses, the critical\r\ncondition of the besieged, and their efforts to gain advantages by\r\nspreading lies. Let the allies but abide till the end of the term\r\nmentioned by the oracle and they would be convinced of its falsity.\r\nThe last argument was perhaps the strongest that could be offered\r\nunder the circumstances, and it was decided to take no risks that\r\nmight imperil the proof.[1180]\r\n\r\nThese precautions were imperative in view of the effect of Aztec\r\nmachinations in the lake districts and outlying provinces. The lake\r\ntowns last to join the Spaniards relapsed into a frigid neutrality,\r\nand might have risen but for the imposing proximity of the fleet and\r\narmy. Remoter districts assumed a more decided attitude, and from\r\nQuauhnahuac came an urgent appeal for help against the attacks of\r\nthe Malinalcas and Cohuixcas, prompted by Mexico. Immediately after\r\nthe late victory Quauhtemotzin had sent envoys to these and other\r\nprovinces, in every direction, bearing heads or flayed skins of\r\nSpaniards and horses, and other tokens, wherewith to impress their\r\nstory that more than half of the white besiegers were slain, and\r\nthat the remainder would soon perish, as declared by the oracle. It\r\nbehooved them, therefore, to decide at once whether they would join\r\nfor a share in the spoils, or be forever excluded from all favor at\r\nthe hands of victorious Mexico. Thus, while many were frightened into\r\nsevering their connection with the invaders, secretly or openly, more\r\naggressive provinces like Malinalco hastened to profit by the state\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo detach troops under the circumstances was not agreeable, and\r\nmany officers objected, but Cortés considered that it would be far\r\nmore dangerous to Spanish prestige and prospects to encourage such\r\nhostile movements by a passive demeanor. “It was now more necessary\r\nthan ever,” he writes, “to exhibit prowess and spirit, so as to\r\nhide our weakness both from friends and foes.” Andrés de Tápia was\r\naccordingly despatched with ten horse and eighty foot, together with\r\na considerable force of allies.[1181] In order to calm the many\r\nremonstrances against the expedition, he was instructed to return\r\nwithin ten days. Tápia found the enemy awaiting him in large force\r\nnear a hamlet not far from Malinalco, and at once prepared to attack,\r\nassisted by the Quauhnahuacs. The ground being level, the horses\r\nproved of great service, and the hostile army was presently in flight\r\ntoward Malinalco. This place was strongly situated on a height, well\r\nsupplied with water, so that Tápia considered it useless to attempt\r\nan assault, much less a siege when so short a term had been allowed\r\nhim, and he accordingly returned.\r\n\r\nThe complaint from Quauhnahuac was followed by a deeper wail from\r\nToluca and adjoining Otomí settlements in the mountain region west of\r\nthe lake. The Matlalzincas, devoted adherents of Quauhtemotzin, had\r\nbeen induced to openly declare for him and to invade their districts,\r\npreparatory to advancing against the Spaniards. This intention had\r\nbeen already vauntingly proclaimed by the Aztecs, and since the\r\nMatlaltzincas were both powerful and warlike, the necessity for prompt\r\nmeasures became even more apparent in this case. The tried Sandoval\r\nwas intrusted with the expedition, composed of eighteen cavalry, one\r\nhundred infantry, and a large force of allies chiefly Otomís, which\r\nsoon grew to about seventy thousand. After a quick march he came\r\nto the smoking ruins of some settlements and startled into flight\r\na band of marauders, who left behind them a quantity of plunder and\r\nprovisions, including some tender children still roasting on the spit.\r\nHe pursued the raiders, and after crossing a river[1182] came upon\r\na larger force, which turned as he approached, to seek safety within\r\nthe town of Matlaltzinco, over two leagues distant. The cavalry made\r\nterrible havoc among them, and the infantry following in their wake,\r\nkilled more than two thousand. Those who escaped made a stand at the\r\ntown to cover the conveyance of families and effects to a fortified\r\nhill close by. This was pretty well accomplished before the infantry\r\ncame up to assist in capturing the town. The defenders now fled, and\r\nthe place was entered and burned, after being rifled of what remained\r\nto take. Since it was late, the assault on the hill was deferred\r\ntill the morning. There the natives maintained a loud uproar until\r\nsome time after midnight, when all became quiet. With early dawn the\r\nSpaniards prepared to storm the hill only to learn that it had been\r\nabandoned. A number of people were seen in the field, however, and\r\neagerly the soldiers revived the fading expectation for a fray. In a\r\ntwinkling they were among the rabble, and a number were slain before\r\nthe explanation gained ears that these people belonged to the friendly\r\nOtomís. Sandoval now advanced on another fortified town, whose cacique\r\nthrew open the gates on beholding the hosts before him, and not only\r\noffered his own submission, but promised to effect the submission of\r\nthe allied caciques and those of Malinalco and Cohuixco. Regardless\r\nof the insinuations of the Otomís that such promises could not be\r\nrelied on, Sandoval returned to Mexico, and four days later appeared\r\nthere the caciques of all these provinces to tender allegiance and\r\naid for the siege.[1183]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the portentous eighth day had dawned on the Spanish camps.\r\nHardly less concerned than the natives, the soldiers could not control\r\ntheir trepidation as they thought of the oracle, although striving\r\nto appear indifferent. Nor were they without tangible reasons for\r\ntheir fears. With a daily growing desertion among the much needed\r\nallies, and fading enthusiasm among those who remained; with supplies\r\ngreatly reduced owing to the neutral attitude assumed by surrounding\r\ndistricts; with fresh wars upon their hands, which demanded not only\r\nmore hardships but a division of their weakened forces; with constant\r\nvigils and alarms amid the harassing attacks of a triumphant foe; with\r\na large number of wounded deprived of needful care and comforts, and\r\nabove all the ghastly spectacle of a daily sacrifice of late comrades,\r\nattended by wild and imposing celebrations—with all this gloom and\r\ndistress it required stout hearts indeed to remain steadfast. Yet\r\nthey were firm; they believed in the strength and justice of their\r\ncause, and in their ultimate triumph, though momentarily dismayed,\r\nprayer afforded them relief. It dissipated fear and infused fresh\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nThus passed the day, amidst fear and hope, and the Spaniards still\r\nexisted. The Mexicans do not appear to have made any special effort\r\nto support the oracle by a determined attack. Nor had they been able\r\nto open any effective communication with the mainland; for although\r\nthe lake towns had withdrawn their canoe fleet, they offered no aid\r\nto the besieged, while the brigantines maintained too strict a guard\r\nto permit many boats to gain the capital with supplies.\r\n\r\nThe ninth day came, and now it was the turn of the Spaniards to exult,\r\nfor not only did they feel inspired with the belief that providence\r\nwas protecting them—and nobly the friars helped Cortés to impart that\r\nstirring idea—but they were cheered with revived animation among the\r\nallies and the early return of most of the deserters. From Tezcuco,\r\nindeed, came additional troops under the command of some Spaniards\r\nthere stationed.[1184] Cortés greeted the returning corps with rather\r\ncold forgiveness. He showed them that besides carrying on the siege\r\nwithout their aid he had undertaken victorious campaigns, and needed\r\nnot their assistance. Nevertheless, since they had served so zealously\r\nbefore, he would not only overlook the grave crime of desertion, due\r\npartly to ignorance of Spanish laws, but let them again share in the\r\nfinal reduction of the city, and thus gain both revenge and riches.\r\nCortés could adopt no other course, for the siege could not be carried\r\non without the allies.\r\n\r\nUnder Spanish training the latter had besides grown very efficient,\r\nas the following instance will illustrate: No sooner had the eight\r\nportentous days passed by than Chichimecatl, the leading Tlascaltec\r\ncaptain serving under Alvarado, disgusted with the idle fears which\r\nhad unmanned his people, and eager to retrieve them in the eyes of the\r\nSpaniards, resolved to show both them and the Aztecs what he could do.\r\nWith the aid of the soldiers the first fortified channel was captured,\r\nand the chief advanced into the city with his own people only, the\r\nflower of his warriors, after leaving several hundred archers near\r\nthe passage to keep the route clear for retreat. With unwavering\r\ncolumns he advanced along the main street and captured the next canal\r\npassage after a fierce struggle. Then he passed onward to the next,\r\nmaintaining a sharp contest all the day. Finally came the hour for\r\nreturning, and the Aztecs bore down with doubled fury on his flank\r\nand rear. The retreat was performed in good order, partly owing to\r\nthe foresight of leaving a rear body; and Chichimecatl came back a\r\nlauded hero.[1185]\r\n\r\nMessengers had been sent to the allies far and wide to encourage them\r\nwith the news of the non-fulfilment of the oracle. Ojeda and Marquez\r\nwent in person to Tlascala, partly also with the object of procuring\r\ncertain supplies. They left Alvarado’s camp at midnight with only\r\na few natives, and when about half-way to Tepeyacac they perceived\r\na train of men descending from the hills with heavy burdens, which\r\nthey deposited in a number of canoes. Information was at once sent to\r\nAlvarado, who placed a guard along the shore to check this smuggling\r\nthat had evidently escaped the cruisers.[1186] Ojeda’s party proceeded\r\nto Tlascala and brought a large train of provisions.[1187] In addition\r\nto this the camps were cheered by the arrival of a party of recruits\r\nwith quite a mass of war material, chiefly powder and cross-bows,\r\nrelics of Ponce de Leon’s Florida expedition.[1188] The war stores\r\nwere particularly valuable; so low had run the actual stock that\r\nCortés was preparing more Chinantec pikes to cover the deficiency in\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nEverything was again ready for a serious revival of hostilities. Over\r\nsix weeks had passed since the siege began, and the end seemed little\r\nnearer than before. On the day of the defeat three fourths of the city\r\nmight be said to have been reduced; but nearly all this advantage had\r\nbeen lost, owing chiefly to the narrow streets, encompassed by houses\r\nwhich served both for attack and retreat, and the numerous traps in\r\nthe form of canals and channels. So long as these obstacles remained\r\nthe progress must not only be slow, ever slower as advance was made,\r\nbut the troops would be constantly exposed to fresh disaster. One\r\nmore defeat might ruin all, and Cortés resolved to avoid risks. He\r\nwould tear down every building as he advanced on both sides of the\r\nstreets, and fill up every channel; “not take one step in advance\r\nwithout leaving all desolated behind, and convert water into firm land,\r\nregardless of the delay.” So writes the general, and yet he expresses\r\nregret for this destruction of the city, “the most beautiful in the\r\nworld.”[1189] In pursuance of this plan he asked the allied chiefs to\r\nsummon additional forces of laborers with the necessary implements.\r\nThey eagerly consented, and within a few days the men stood prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [1143] ‘Eran esclavos del señor de Tenuxtitan,’ is Cortés’\r\n     definition of their vassalage to Mexico. _Cartas_, 220.\r\n\r\n     [1144] A service which employed 20,000 carriers, 1000\r\n     canoes, and 32,000 convoy warriors, all at the expense of\r\n     Tezcuco, says Ixtlilxochitl, _Relaciones_, 314.\r\n\r\n     [1145] His biographer admits to a certain extent the truth\r\n     of the invectives, but eager to please his Spanish masters\r\n     he seeks rather to extol the self-sacrifice and loyalty\r\n     of his kinsman. He claims that with this reënforcement the\r\n     Tezcucan auxiliaries reached the improbable number of 250,000\r\n     men, of whom 5000 wounded were now sent home. ‘Next to God,\r\n     Cortés owed to Tezcucan aid the conquest and the planting\r\n     of the faith.’ He further assumes that Ixtlilxochitl was\r\n     already king, and had been with Cortés since the fleet\r\n     set sail, while his brother Ahuaxpictzoctzin remained at\r\n     Tezcuco to provide supplies. _Hor.

Verdad._, 144-5.\r\n\r\n     [1153] Cortés exultantly claims that three fourths of the\r\n     city is now captured. _Cartas_, 227; _Sahagun_, _Hist.\r\n     Conq._ (ed. 1840), 181; _Torquemada_, i. 550.\r\n\r\n     [1154] ‘No se hartauan de pescado, que tuuierõ pocos dias:\r\n     y demas de la hambre con q̄ peleauan, el sol, y el frio\r\n     no les dio pequeño trabajo.’ _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. i.\r\n     cap. xix.\r\n\r\n     [1155] ‘Soliti sunt hostes in prælio cadentes intra suos\r\n     ventres sepelire,’ explains Peter Martyr, dec. v. cap.\r\n     viii., and with some truth.\r\n\r\n     [1156] Forty soldiers watched till midnight, when a similar\r\n     number relieved them, and they again were relieved two hours\r\n     before dawn; all three divisions camping on the spot. Often\r\n     every man was kept awake by alarms. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 142-3. The old soldier waxes eloquent over the\r\n     hardships, for he served at this camp.\r\n\r\n     [1157] The Spaniards tried in vain to despatch him.\r\n     Sahagun states that during these attacks fifteen soldiers\r\n     were captured, and shortly after eighteen more, who were\r\n     sacrificed in a temple of Tlacuchcalco ward, ‘donde agora\r\n     es la iglesia de Santa Ana.’ _Hist. Conq._, 183, ed.\r\n     1840, 188-9. One repulse took place in Coyonacazco ward.\r\n     _Torquemada_, i. 550-2. Spanish versions indicate no such\r\n     losses, and they may probably belong to the later great\r\n     defeat.\r\n\r\n     [1158] Such is in main the version of Bernal Diaz; the\r\n     other accounts differ greatly. This author states that five\r\n     Spaniards were captured, nearly all the men wounded, and\r\n     two rowers killed, for the brigantines in seeking to aid\r\n     had become fast on stakes and exposed to attack. Had the\r\n     Mexicans not been so frightened by the horsemen the loss\r\n     would have been very great. _Hist. Verdad._, 143-4. Cortés\r\n     allows three or four captured. _Cartas_, 228; _Clavigero_,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 196. Duran places the scene where rose\r\n     afterward the San Hipólito hermitage. _Hist. Ind._, MS.,\r\n     ii. 500. But for Quauhtlizcatzin, the prince who led the\r\n     Tezcucan auxiliaries, all the Spaniards would have been\r\n     lost, exclaims Ixtlilxochitl, _Hor. Crueldades_, 36. Herrera\r\n     assumes that the fault lay with Alvarado for neglecting to\r\n     fill the channel. dec. iii. lib. i. cap. xx.\r\n\r\n     [1159] ‘No solo no le culpo, mas loole.’ _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Mex._, 203.\r\n\r\n     [1160] The most serious attacks took place on June 24th and\r\n     25th, as if oracles had impelled the Mexicans to seek the\r\n     destruction of the Spaniards on the anniversary of their\r\n     reëntry into the city after the Alvarado massacre. The\r\n     Tlacopan camp lost ten soldiers and had a dozen severely\r\n     wounded, including Alvarado. _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     142, 145.\r\n\r\n     [1161] Bernal Diaz seeks to convey the idea that he or his\r\n     camp were opposed to the attempt, _Id._, 146, but had it\r\n     succeeded, he would probably have declared the truth, that\r\n     Cortés was urged on all sides to make the effort, as stated\r\n     in _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 203, _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib.\r\n     i. cap. xx., and _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 228-9. Perhaps the\r\n     general made objections chiefly to cover his responsibility\r\n     in case of failure.\r\n\r\n     [1162] Alderete’s party consisted of 70 infantry, 7 or 8\r\n     horsemen, and 15,000 to 20,000 allies, besides a force of\r\n     laborers to tear down and to fill up; Tápia’s of 80 men and\r\n     over 10,000 allies, and Cortés’ of 8 horsemen, 100 infantry,\r\n     and an immense number of allies. _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 230-1.\r\n     Gomara and Herrera differ slightly. Ixtlilxochitl says\r\n     that his namesake followed Cortés with 8000 Tezcucans.\r\n     _Hor. Crueldades_, 37. This insignificant number makes it\r\n     difficult to account for the 250,000 Tezcucans which he\r\n     lately introduced into the camps. Chimalpain names the\r\n     three streets Cuahuecatitlan, Tecontlanamacoya, and the\r\n     later Santa Ana. _Hist. Conq._, ii. 62.\r\n\r\n     [1163] See _Native Races_, ii. 303; iii. 293 et seq.\r\n\r\n     [1164] He crossed the channel with fifteen soldiers to\r\n     sustain the fugitives, says Torquemada, i. 554; but this\r\n     seems incorrect.\r\n\r\n     [1165] The claims to the honor of rescuing the general are\r\n     conflicting. Gomara, followed by Herrera and Torquemada,\r\n     names ‘Francisco’ de Olea. Bernal Diaz, who states that\r\n     this soldier slew four of the captains holding Cortés,\r\n     lets Lerma dispose of the remainder. After this came other\r\n     soldiers and Quiñones. Cristóbal de Olea was quite young, 26\r\n     years of age, a native of Medina del Campo, muscular, and\r\n     skilled in arms, and a general favorite. Bernal Diaz adds\r\n     other particulars. _Hist. Verdad._, 146, 246. Ixtlilxochitl,\r\n     on the other hand, claims for his namesake the credit of\r\n     having done what Spaniards claim for Olea, aided by his\r\n     Tezcucans, who kept the enemy at bay. This, he adds, is\r\n     proved by a painting on the gate of the monastery of Santiago\r\n     Tlatelulco. _Hor. Crueldades_, 38-9. Herrera briefly alludes\r\n     to Ixtlilxochitl as coming up after Olea, and then relates\r\n     with some detail that at the same time came the Tlascaltec,\r\n     Tamaxautzin he calls him, a native of Hueyotlipan. He was\r\n     afterward baptized as Antonio or Bautista, and became a\r\n     good Christian, the first native to receive extreme unction.\r\n     dec. iii. lib. i. cap. xx. Torquemada, i. 555, copies, but\r\n     calls the man Teamacatzin. Both evidently prefer Tlascaltec\r\n     to Tezcucan records. In fact, Ixtlilxochitl adds certain\r\n     incredible particulars about the prowess of his wounded hero\r\n     in pursuing the Mexican general into a temple, although such\r\n     pursuit could not have taken place under the circumstances.\r\n     See also _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 503, and _Camargo_,\r\n     _Hist. Tlax._, 130. Cortés writes that he would have been\r\n     lost but for Quiñones, and one of his men who lost his life\r\n     to save him. _Cartas_, 233. A small chapel was erected in\r\n     the convent de la Concepcion to commemorate the escape.\r\n     See _Saavedra_, _Indio Peregrino_, canto 20.\r\n\r\n     [1166] Bernal Diaz assumes that Guzman rode up after Cortés\r\n     was mounted, and fell captive into Aztec hands. _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 147.\r\n\r\n     [1167] ‘Como lo hallarán pintado en la Yglesia de Tlatilulco,\r\n     los cuales Indios confiesan haberle visto.’ _Duran_, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, MS., ii. 512. Why these patrons did not give their aid\r\n     before is a question to which Bernal Diaz answers ‘porque\r\n     Nuestro Señor Iesu Christo lo permitiò.’ _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     146.\r\n\r\n     [1168] Herrera relates how two captains, Flores and Mota,\r\n     advanced with their vessels up a narrow channel. Flores was\r\n     severely pressed at one time, and the latter had to sally\r\n     on the street to relieve him and enable the brigantines\r\n     to gain more open water. Flores died within a week of his\r\n     wounds. dec. iii. lib. i. cap. xx. Torquemada says that\r\n     Briones’ vessel was lifted through a breach in the causeway.\r\n     i. 555. Bernal Diaz speaks of several such narrow escapes.\r\n     loc. cit.\r\n\r\n     [1169] The artillerists being all disabled or dead, Pedro\r\n     Moreno de Medrano, afterward a settler at Puebla, took\r\n     their place. _Id._\r\n\r\n     [1170] Bernal Diaz writes as if Sandoval gained the camp\r\n     at an early hour, rode over to Fort Xoloc, and came back\r\n     in time to aid in Alvarado’s retreat. But he would never\r\n     have ventured to leave his command and his comrade in\r\n     their danger; nor does it seem likely that he could have\r\n     ridden the long distance to Xoloc and back in time to join\r\n     in Alvarado’s conflict, even if Cortés’ defeat took place\r\n     before ‘misa mayor,’ as he assumes. _Hist. Verdad._, 146-8.\r\n     This author is here very confused, assuming, for instance,\r\n     that Sandoval was fighting from his own camp instead of\r\n     coöperating near Alvarado.\r\n\r\n     [1171] So deeply affected was Bernal Diaz, among others, by\r\n     the sight, and by the fear of himself falling captive—twice\r\n     had he narrowly escaped—that he ever after had an oppressive\r\n     feeling before battle. He then had recourse to prayer,\r\n     and this invariably fortified him for the fight, so that\r\n     he always maintained his reputation as a good soldier. He\r\n     enumerates several incidents to prove that he was esteemed\r\n     a brave man. _Hist. Verdad._, 157. Oviedo, referring to\r\n     human sacrifices among the Romans, observes that they could\r\n     not have been half so fearful. iii. 515.\r\n\r\n     [1172] ‘Sacrificados los Nuestros, en el Momoztli, y Templo\r\n     de su Maior Dios,’ observes Torquemada, i. 553, among other\r\n     points, though all are not exactly true. Huitzilopochtli’s\r\n     image had been brought with the retreating Mexicans to\r\n     Tlatelulco. ‘Immediatamente sacrificati,’ says Clavigero,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 212, probably on authority of Gomara;\r\n     but Bernal Diaz states that the sacrifices lasted ten days,\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 150; others write eight; one victim is\r\n     said to have been kept eighteen days. See also _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist. Conq._, 192. Ixtlilxochitl states that three victims\r\n     were burned. _Hor. Crueldades_, 39.\r\n\r\n     [1173] A count revealed the loss of 62 men and 6 horses,\r\n     says Bernal Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 146, 152, 241, though\r\n     he in one place leaves the impression that the men were all\r\n     captured alive. This could hardly be the case, for a ‘count’\r\n     would reveal only the missing; none could tell how many\r\n     fell captive. Yet Prescott boldly assumes this number to\r\n     have been taken, besides those who fell. Vetancurt divides\r\n     the figures into 40 captives and 20 dead, _Teatro Mex._,\r\n     pt. iii. 162, and Clavigero also includes dead and captive\r\n     in that number, while raising the dead horses to 7. _Storia\r\n     Mess._, iii. 212. Solis writes that over 40 Spaniards were\r\n     carried off alive, and that Alvarado and Sandoval lost 20.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, ii. 410. Bernal Diaz acknowledges only a third\r\n     of such loss between these two captains. Gomara gives 40\r\n     captives, several killed, 3 or 4 horses lost, and over 30\r\n     wounded. _Hist. Mex._, 205-6. Ixtlilxochitl raises the allied\r\n     loss to over 2000. _Hor. Crueldades_, 37-9. Fifty-three\r\n     Spaniards, says Sahagun, _Hist. Conq._, 192. In the cédula\r\n     of March 7, 1525, granting a coat-of-arms to Cortés, 50 are\r\n     mentioned, but in his letter to the sovereign the general\r\n     acknowledges only 35 to 40 and over 1000 allies. Herrera\r\n     and Torquemada adopt these figures. Oviedo, iii. 516, lowers\r\n     the number to 30. Duran, who confounds the late repulse of\r\n     Alvarado with the Sorrowful Night and this defeat, allows\r\n     4 banners to be captured. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 501-4,\r\n     508.\r\n\r\n     [1174] Bernal Diaz gives this conversation with some detail,\r\n     and names Treasurer Alderete as the guilty officer who\r\n     neglected to fill the channel, intimating that Cortés had\r\n     been heedlessly allured onward by the Mexicans, leaving\r\n     Alderete to attend to the filling. He even allows the\r\n     treasurer to retort to the charge, in Sandoval’s presence,\r\n     that Cortés’ eagerness had been the cause of the neglect.\r\n     This is probably an invented account, based on Gomara’s\r\n     statement that the ‘treasurer,’ no name being given,\r\n     neglected to fill a channel on his route. Informed of this,\r\n     Cortés hastened thither to remedy the fault, only to meet the\r\n     fleeing. Herrera adopts this version, as do most writers,\r\n     including Prescott; but it is evidently wrong, for Cortés\r\n     writes clearly that the misfortune occurred on his own\r\n     route, some distance above its junction with the Tlacopan\r\n     road, to which they soon retreated. On reaching this road\r\n     he sent to recall the ‘treasurer and comptroller,’ who were\r\n     leading their division victoriously at the farther end of\r\n     it. Owing to their care in filling channels ‘they received\r\n     no injury in retreating.’ _Cartas_, 233-4. There can be\r\n     little doubt about this statement, since Cortés would have\r\n     been only too glad to cast the blame on any other division\r\n     than his own. He does not even claim to have been at the\r\n     front, but in the rear, and near the spot where the neglect\r\n     occurred. The only question then is, who was the guilty\r\n     officer? The ‘treasurer’ commanded the centre division,\r\n     and although there were several treasurers, the royal,\r\n     late and new, and he who acted for the army, yet the new\r\n     royal treasurer is undoubtedly meant, and this appears to\r\n     have been Alderete, according to the statement of several\r\n     authorities. Hence the accusation against Alderete must be\r\n     wrong; anything besides this must be conjecture.\r\n\r\n     [1175] ‘Bolviò à la grita, Andrés de Tapia [the captain of\r\n     his party] matò mas de sesenta Mexicanos,’ adds Torquemada,\r\n     i. 558-9.\r\n\r\n     [1176] ‘Esto no fue sino cinco dias.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist.\r\n     Verdad._, 149.\r\n\r\n     [1177] Similar women of courage were María de Estrada, the\r\n     heroine of Otumba, Beatriz de Escobar, Juana Martin, and\r\n     Beatriz de Palacios. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. ii. cap. i.\r\n\r\n     [1178] Oil was the chief remedy. _Torquemada_, i. 558-60.\r\n     Bernal Diaz speaks of a soldier named Juan Catalan who\r\n     performed cures with the sign of the cross and psalm-singing.\r\n     The Tlascaltecs also besieged the man for his attentions.\r\n     ‘Y verdaderamente digo, que hallauamos que Nuestro Señor\r\n     Iesu Christo era servido de darnos esfuerço, ... y de\r\n     presto sanauan.’ Not twenty of Alvarado’s men were free\r\n     from wounds at this time. _Hist. Verdad._, 142. Solis allows\r\n     this wonderful healing power to be attributed to no woman.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, ii. 412. But then he was a strict priest,\r\n     who saw woman chiefly as a feeble and adoring supplicant.\r\n\r\n     [1179] ‘Que de ai a ocho dias no auia de quedar ninguno\r\n     de nosotros a vida, porque assi se lo auian prometido la\r\n     noche antes sus Dioses.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 149.\r\n\r\n     [1180] Solis, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 415, states, and Prescott\r\n     hastily affirms, that nearly all the allies deserted, and\r\n     Bernal Diaz enumerates the mere handful that remained;\r\n     but this must be erroneous, as shown by the course of the\r\n     narratives in general. Two expeditions were sent forth about\r\n     this time, and the large number of allies which joined\r\n     therein may account in part for the gaps which gave rise\r\n     to the above exaggeration. Cortés, indeed, alludes very\r\n     indirectly to any defection.\r\n\r\n     [1181] Forty thousand, says Ixtlilxochitl, obtained chiefly\r\n     from Quauhnahuac and other towns subject to Tezcuco. _Hor.\r\n     Crueldades_, 40. Herrera and others mention no auxiliaries\r\n     from the camp. Bernal Diaz is confused.\r\n\r\n     [1182] The Chicuhnauhtla, Ixtlilxochitl calls it.\r\n\r\n     [1183] ‘Y ellos le siruieron muy biẽ en el cerco.’ _Gomara_,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 207. Ixtlilxochitl claims of course that his\r\n     Tezcucans formed the chief auxiliaries of Sandoval. Bernal\r\n     Diaz wrongly gives Tápia this expedition, which Cortés\r\n     intimates to have been sent about three days after the\r\n     return of the Quauhnahuac party. _Cartas_, 237.\r\n\r\n     [1184] Farfan and Villareal came, says Bernal Diaz,\r\n     and Tecapaneca, cacique of Topeyanco, led the returning\r\n     Tlascaltecs. _Hist. Verdad._, 151.\r\n\r\n     [1185] Cortés leaves the impression that this incident\r\n     took place during the days when the Spaniards were making\r\n     desultory entries into the city; but since he does not speak\r\n     of the oracle or the defection the affair is undecided.\r\n     Torquemada, i. 557, intimates that Chichimecatl served\r\n     under Sandoval, but this is wrong.\r\n\r\n     [1186] Ojeda magnifies the train of men to 4000 and the\r\n     canoes to 3000. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. i. cap. xxii.\r\n\r\n     [1187] Fifteen hundred loads maize, 1000 loads fowl, 300\r\n     sides venison, besides other effects, including Xicotencatl’s\r\n     confiscated property and women. _Id._\r\n\r\n     [1188] Herrera intimates that the material may have been\r\n     a consignment to Leon, for which the disappointed owner\r\n     sought a market. A vessel of Aillon’s fleet, says Bernal\r\n     Diaz, _Hist. Verdad._, 153.\r\n\r\n     [1189] Some time before he had expressed the same intention,\r\n     and the fear that little or no treasure would be recovered.\r\n     _Cartas_, 222, 241. Ixtlilxochitl claims that his namesake\r\n     provided 100,000 men for the task, _Hor. Crueldades_, 42,\r\n     and Bernal Diaz states that this prince proposed purely a\r\n     strict blockade as a safe and sure plan. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     150. The result proves that this would have been the best\r\n     and as speedy as the one adopted, while the city would\r\n     have been saved from destruction. That the plan was ever\r\n     seriously suggested among this impatient crew is affirmed\r\n     by no other authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST ACHIEVED.\r\n\r\nJULY-AUGUST, 1521.\r\n\r\n     THE DESTROYERS ADVANCE—FIERCE FIGHTING IN THE PLAZA—DISMAL\r\n     SITUATION OF THE MEXICANS—THE WORK OF DEMOLITION—MOVEMENTS\r\n     OF ALVARADO—THE EMPEROR REFUSES TO PARLEY—MISERY OF\r\n     THE AZTECS UNBEARABLE—HORRIBLE MASSACRE OF WOMEN AND\r\n     CHILDREN—THE TENDER-HEARTED CORTÉS MOURNS OVER HIS OWN\r\n     WORK—CAPTURE OF THE EMPEROR—THE CONQUEST COMPLETED—BANQUETS\r\n     AND THANKSGIVINGS—DISPERSION OF THE ALLIES TO THEIR\r\n     HOMES—REFLECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a force of over one hundred and fifty thousand men the Spaniards\r\nnow advanced on the city, a large proportion destined wholly to raze\r\nbuildings, fill channels, and remove obstacles, while the rest were\r\nto drive back the enemy and keep them at bay. At the channel near\r\nthe plaza the Mexicans detained the forces for an hour with a peace\r\nproposal, in order to gain time for some operation, and then suddenly\r\nthey began to ply their missiles. Cortés was not slow to accept the\r\nchallenge, and led the attack with a recklessness that caused his\r\nfollowers to remonstrate with him for exposing so valuable a life.\r\nIt had the effect, however, of so encouraging the charging party that\r\nthe channel with its intrenchments was quickly captured. On reaching\r\nthe plaza they found it covered with loose stones, which prevented\r\nthe horses from running. Several streets leading to it were blocked\r\nwith stone barricades. The main effort for this day was directed\r\ntoward opening the approach to the plaza, which was to serve as the\r\nstarting-point for subsequent movements. The work was slow, owing to\r\nthe massive character of the buildings along the leading avenue, and\r\nin this imperial centre of the city; but myriads swarmed thereat,\r\nand structure after structure was levelled, opening wide access to\r\nthe southern causeway.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans made repeated efforts to stay such ruthless destruction.\r\nBut their onslaught was futile, for thundering cannon and fiery\r\nchargers protected every point. “Burn and raze, you slaves,” they\r\nshouted to the auxiliaries in their impotent fury; “you will have to\r\nrebuild it all, either for us if we win, or for your present masters\r\nif they conquer!” And so it happened. With dreary tasks did they pay\r\nfor the momentary triumph over their enemy. During the withdrawal of\r\nthe troops to camp in the evening the Mexicans were able to make a\r\nforcible demonstration, more so than usual on these occasions, if we\r\nmay credit the native records. They pushed in front of their lines a\r\nfine-looking Spanish cross-bowman, reserved from the late captives,\r\nand sought to make him direct his arrows against his countrymen. This\r\nhe refused to do, always shooting too high, and finally the enraged\r\nAztecs cut him down. His presence naturally interfered with the free\r\noperations of the soldiers, as the enemy had expected.\r\n\r\nOn the following days Cortés ascended the commanding temple pyramid\r\nin the plaza, and thence directed more effectively the operations\r\nfor razing buildings and driving back the Mexicans, who fought with\r\ndesperation for every foot of ground, so much so that on one day\r\nalone fell twenty thousand it is said. On one occasion a corps of\r\nTlascaltecs crossed a canal and were thrown into disorder by the enemy.\r\nThe Aztecs began to exult, and one of their number, a muscular warrior\r\nwith enormous bejewelled plumage, armed with a Spanish sword and\r\nshield, shouted a challenge to any Spaniard. Several were ready, among\r\nthem Hernando de Osma, who had just swum across the canal to sustain\r\nthe wavering allies. Dripping wet he rushed upon the warrior, but\r\nreceived a blow which cleft his shield. Recovering himself, he dealt\r\nthe Mexican a thrust from below and stretched him dead, whereupon he\r\nsnatched the sword and plumage and sprang back in time to escape the\r\npursuing friends of the fallen man. He afterward offered the trophy\r\nto Cortés, who accepted, but returned it at once with the remark that\r\nnone was so worthy thereof as he who had won it. The deed served also\r\nto reanimate the Tlascaltecs, and they sustained their position.\r\n\r\nNot long after, another powerful warrior, similarly plumed, came\r\nforth brandishing a Spanish sword and announcing that he sought the\r\nglory of either dying by the hand of a brave Spaniard or defeating\r\nhim. Cortés, who was present, told him that ten more men like himself\r\nwere needed to match one soldier. The warrior insisted. “Very well,”\r\nsaid the general, “this beardless page of mine shall despatch you,\r\nand demonstrate the mettle of our Castilian boys.” Juan Nuñez de\r\nMercado, as the youth was called, thereupon stepped forward, and\r\nbravely as this Goliah fought, a few passes from the skilled arm\r\nof the youngster soon sufficed to lay him low. This feat served not\r\nalone to discourage duels with Spaniards, but was regarded by many\r\nMexicans as a bad omen.[1190]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the reverses of the enemy, they usually rallied\r\nin the evening to pursue the troops as they returned to camp, the\r\nallies being always sent back first so as to leave the road clear for\r\nthe soldiers, covered by the cavalry. One day the pursuit was not\r\nmade for some reason, and a few horsemen ventured to look into it,\r\nbut only to be driven back with two animals badly wounded. Cortés\r\nresolved to be avenged. He ordered Sandoval to reënforce him so\r\nas to increase the number of horse to forty. Thirty of these were\r\nposted early in the day in a hiding-place near the plaza, and close\r\nby a hundred select soldiers and a corps of Tlascaltecs. When the\r\nhour came to return to camp, the Mexicans, as expected, fell upon\r\nthe retreating lines in stronger force than ever, encouraged by the\r\nachievement of the previous evening and by the pretended timidity\r\nof the ten horsemen who covered the rear. When the first columns of\r\npursuers had well passed the hiding-place, the signal was given,\r\nand with ringing Santiagos the parties in ambush rushed upon the\r\nstartled warriors. Finding their retreat cut off, the severed section\r\nlost presence of mind, and permitted themselves to be butchered like\r\ncattle. When the massacre was over, fully five hundred of the flower\r\nof the Aztec armies covered the ground.[1191] Never again were the\r\nSpaniards exposed to pursuit near or beyond the plaza, or indeed to\r\nany such fierce charges, and the horses became again an object of\r\nawe.[1192]\r\n\r\nThe captives were questioned regarding the condition of the city,\r\nand from them a revelation was obtained showing that the majority of\r\nthe occupants were in favor of capitulation, but afraid to express\r\ntheir views in face of the firmness of Quauhtemotzin and his party,\r\nwho were resolved to defend their city to the end. And there was\r\nstill enthusiasm among the Mexican people. Women and cripples could\r\nbe seen preparing and bringing war material for stronger arms to use;\r\nthey swept dust from the roofs into the faces of assailants, while\r\nchildren threw tiny stones and lisped an echo of the curse that fell\r\nfrom the lips of their parents. But all this manifest spirit was\r\nslowly but surely subsiding, and deep and dismal woe was settling down\r\nupon them.[1193] Alas for Mexico, pride of the grand plateau! Alas\r\nfor thine ancient grandeur! Blotted out forever must be thy culture,\r\ncrushed thy budding progress! The days of thy glory are ended; and\r\nso are thy bloody ceremonies and sacrificial stones!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLong sieges had never suited the native ideas of warfare, and\r\nexperience could therefore teach little in the preparation for the\r\nevent. Vast supplies had been accumulated by the Mexicans, but a\r\nlarge influx of fugitives from the lake towns had swelled the number\r\nof non-combatants and had helped to diminish the food supply, which\r\nhad received but scanty additions, owing to the close watch of the\r\ncruisers. Nor had any restrictions been placed on consumption, since\r\nthe provisions were chiefly in private hands. Now famine was raging\r\nwith rapidly increasing horrors, and jewels were offered by the handful\r\nfor an equal quantity of food.[1194] Excluded from such competition,\r\nthe poorer classes sought in holes and canals for snails, lizards,\r\nand rats, skimmed the surface of the water for its mucilaginous scum,\r\nor tore up the earth for roots and weeds, glad even to chew the bark\r\nof trees, and anxiously waiting for the scanty allowance of brackish\r\nwater. Disease was marching hand-in-hand with hunger, and weakened by\r\ntheir sufferings hundreds were left to linger in torment till welcome\r\ndeath relieved them. The frequency of these incidents made the people\r\ncallous, and the sufferings even of near friends were looked on with\r\nindifference by the gaunt and hollow-eyed, who were themselves marked\r\nfor death.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the consequences, many crept at night close to the\r\nSpanish camps in search of roots and refuse which could no longer be\r\nfound within their precincts. Advised of such movements, a body of\r\nsoldiers and allies was sent out before sunrise one day and fell on\r\na large number, slaughtering many of them before discovering them\r\nto be starving women and children.[1195] It was necessary to take\r\nincreased measures even against these surreptitious attempts to\r\nsustain the defence, and to keep in the useless population, though\r\nthere was little prospect of any important exodus, since the fear\r\nof the savage and cannibal auxiliaries who surrounded the city made\r\nits very pest-holes appear attractive places of refuge. The vessels\r\nwere particularly efficient for this purpose, the more so since the\r\ncrews had found a ready means to render the submerged stakes and\r\npalisades of little hindrance.[1196] They were thus enabled to ravage\r\nthe suburbs, and to coöperate with the other forces by landing and\r\ndriving the inhabitants toward the narrow quarter in which they were\r\nnow confined. They had not always an easy task, however, for the\r\nMexicans were growing more reckless, and would sometimes venture to\r\nmeet even the ‘winged houses.’\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a portion of the fleet was closely beset in a confined\r\nplace, and the flag-ship happening to strand on some timbers the\r\ncrew became panic-stricken and sought to abandon her. Martin Lopez,\r\nthe builder, who was the chief pilot, at once turned against the\r\ndeserters, and being a large and powerful man he pitched two into the\r\nwater, beat and bruised half a dozen others, and soon compelled their\r\nreturn to duty. He thereupon led them against the enemy and drove\r\nthem off, killing the leader, who was a prominent officer. For this\r\nimportant service the brave Lopez was rewarded with a captaincy.[1197]\r\n\r\nCortés made quite rapid advance in the work of demolition, considering\r\nthe immensity of it. The Tlacopan road had been levelled, rendering\r\ncommunication easy with the camp of Alvarado, and on the eve of\r\nSantiago’s day[1198] the greater part of the main street to the\r\nmarket was gained. This thoroughfare bore afterward the name of\r\nGuatemotzin,[1199] because this emperor’s palace was here situated.\r\nStrongly fortified, its capture was not effected without a severe\r\nstruggle, wherein many a brave fellow met his fate. During the fight\r\nAlderete’s horse became unmanageable from a thrust, and rushed amid\r\nthe enemy in mad fury, creating more disorder by his pawing and biting\r\nthan a squad of soldiers could have done.[1200]\r\n\r\nEqually severe was the struggle on the following days in entering\r\nand filling a street with a wide canal, adjoining the main road. At\r\nthe same time was taken a temple,[1201] wherein a number of impaled\r\nbearded heads stared the horrified Spaniards in the face. Tears filled\r\nthe eyes of the beholders, and reverently the ghastly remains were\r\ntaken down to receive Christian rites.[1202]\r\n\r\nThe progress of Cortés’ party in the direction of Tlatelulco market,\r\nthe objective point of all the movements, had impelled Alvarado to\r\nalmost superhuman efforts to gain before them a spot lying much nearer\r\nto his camp. Once within, he hoped to keep his ground, for it was\r\nlarge and level, twice the size of the market-place in Salamanca,\r\nsays Cortés, and capable of accommodating sixty thousand persons. It\r\nwas lined with porticos, wherein more substantial traders had their\r\nshops, while the open square was covered with booths, between which the\r\nSpaniards had so often wandered to gaze on products of every variety,\r\nfrom field and forest, from river and mountain, as well as from the\r\nworkshop of artisan and artist.[1203] Thus it was formerly; but now\r\nwere to be displayed only the worst phases of human selfishness,\r\ncunning, and brutality; blood and corpses in lieu of fabrics and\r\nprovisions; fierce war-cries and the clash of arms in place of merry\r\ntraffickings and the clink of coin. By the day following Santiago’s day\r\nAlvarado had levelled a wide approach, and now he resolved to direct\r\nhis whole strength against this plaza, leaving merely a portion of\r\nhis auxiliaries to attend to further razing operations. Before dawn\r\nthe next morning he advanced with all his force and took the Aztecs\r\nby surprise. He effected an entrance with little trouble, and was\r\nable to meet in good order the bands which came to retrieve their\r\nneglect by fierce charges. They were led by the renowned orders of\r\nTigers and Eagles, conspicuous in their corresponding gear, and eager\r\nto maintain the reputation which had gained for them their insignia.\r\nMayehuatzin, lord of Cuitlahuac, was also among the prominent leaders,\r\nbut the cavalry soon obliged him to turn in flight, and enabled the\r\ninfantry to capture a number of the shops which lined the market, and\r\nbegin to pillage. Much more determined proved the division under the\r\nTiger captain, Coyohuehuetzin, who fell back and maintained himself\r\non the Momuztli edifice.\r\n\r\nWhile the main portion of the Spanish forces thus fought at different\r\npoints in the plaza with varying advantage, Captain Gutierre de Badajoz\r\nwas ordered to capture the great temple which overlooked the market.\r\nIt was held by Temilotzin and Tlacatecatl, who fiercely disputed his\r\nadvance. Time and again were his men driven back, or sent tumbling\r\ndown the steps, bruised and bleeding, many a one never to rise. But\r\nBadajoz persevered, and step by step he climbed upward, sustained by\r\nreënforcements, till after two hours of hard contest the summit was\r\ngained, first by Alférez Montaño. Woe now to the defenders remaining!\r\nNot a Spaniard there but had wounds to show, and not one who did not\r\nstrive to exact blood for blood. It was a repetition of the aerial\r\ncombat of the year before on the summit of the central temple. The\r\nMexicans neither expected mercy nor asked it; rather longed they to\r\ndedicate their last breath to the gods, and gain by glorious death\r\nadmission into the abode of the blessed. By nine o’clock in the\r\nforenoon the two wooden towers holding the altars and idols were\r\ngained, and the next moment dense smoke columns rose to announce the\r\nvictory of the Spaniards.[1204] Loud rose the wail of the natives\r\nas they witnessed the portentous result, and with the recklessness\r\nof despair they renewed their onslaught, led by Axoquentzin and the\r\nEagle captain, Quachic. So severely pressed was Alvarado that he was\r\nobliged to call down Badajoz and to concentrate his forces, abandoning\r\nthe several temples which surrounded the large pyramid. Encouraged by\r\nthis success the Mexicans pushed their advantage from all sides, and\r\nunable to hold their position the Spaniards retired with considerable\r\nloss, including three horses.[1205]\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, Alvarado repeated his entry on the following day, and\r\nmet with comparatively little opposition, the enemy being evidently\r\ndiscouraged by the fall of the temple and the resolute bearing of\r\nthe Spaniards. He now passed through and came up to Cortés’ party, by\r\nwhom he was received with ringing and repeated cheers. The latter had\r\njust captured the last canal and intrenchments near the market-place,\r\nafter a sharp struggle, and now the general and his doughty lieutenant\r\nentered the market and ascended the lofty pyramid, on which the royal\r\nbanner waved a proud welcome, while beside it the still impaled heads\r\nof white and dusky victims recalled the bitter vengeance yet to be\r\nexacted. Surveying the city beneath him on all sides, Cortés says: “It\r\nseemed undoubted that of eight parts we had gained seven.” The late\r\nmagnificent metropolis, the finest and largest on all the northern\r\ncontinent, displayed now a mass of ruins, through which the broad paths\r\nlevelled by the invaders led to the one corner which alone remained\r\nto the besieged,[1206] wherein, amid famine, pest, and putrefying\r\nbodies, they huddled in packed masses, sending forth from their\r\nmidst the groans of dying and loud lamentations, in an atmosphere so\r\npestiferous that the soldiers who entered the lately abandoned lanes\r\nwere almost stifled. People were found in different stages of hunger\r\nand disease, meeting the soldiers with passive indifference in the\r\nrecklessness of despair. Beyond on the roofs stalked the warriors,\r\ngaunt and yellow, like caged and starving beasts.\r\n\r\nCortés felt painfully oppressed on beholding so much misery, and at\r\nonce ordering a stay of hostilities he sent some captive chiefs to\r\nQuauhtemotzin with peace proposals, showing the utter futility of\r\nfurther resistance, which could involve only a needless infliction\r\nof suffering and slaughter, and embitter against him and his the\r\nbesieging forces. He was prepared to forget all past animosity, and\r\nrespect the persons and property of the besieged, and his rights\r\nas sovereign, and demanded in return only the renewal of allegiance\r\nalready offered in Montezuma’s time. Quauhtemotzin scarcely gave the\r\nmessengers time to speak, before he answered solemnly: “Tell Malinche\r\nthat I and mine elect to die. We will intrust ourselves neither to\r\nthe men who commit, nor to the God who permits, such atrocities!”\r\n\r\nStruck by the lofty bearing of the doomed, and desirous of securing\r\nthe treasure which the besieged assured him would all be cast into\r\nthe water before his fingers should touch it, Cortés again sent a\r\nproposal, formally attested by notary and witnesses, declaring that\r\nthe responsibility for the terrible consequences which must follow\r\nthe rejection of his offer would fall wholly on the besieged. But all\r\nwithout avail. And when the priests came and declared the oracle,\r\n“Appeased by sacrifice the gods have promised victory after three\r\ndays,” Quauhtemotzin made answer, his council being present: “It is\r\nwell. And since it is so, let us have a care of the provisions, and\r\nif need be die fighting like men. Let no one henceforth speak of\r\npeace under pain of death!”\r\n\r\nPreparations were accordingly made to renew hostilities at the\r\ndesignated time, on which occasion sacred relics were to be brought\r\ninto service from the paraphernalia of Huitzilopochtli, one a twisted\r\nsnake sceptre set with mosaic, called the Xiuhcoatl, which was said\r\nto become alive when launched against the foe and terrify them to\r\nflight; the other a war-dress of feathers tipped with an owl’s head\r\nof fearful aspect, an ægis to scatter the enemy.[1207]\r\n\r\nCortés on his side was not impatient to break the truce, for he knew\r\nthat hunger and disease were efficiently fighting his battle, and he\r\nwas besides busy constructing in the market-place a catapult which was\r\nto soon end his labors there whatever might be the further decision of\r\nthe Mexicans. The idea had been suggested by a soldier named Sotelo,\r\nwho boasted of military science acquired during the Italian wars; and\r\nsince powder was becoming scarce the necessary carpenters were readily\r\nfurnished to construct the machine. “Behold!” cried the Tlascaltecs,\r\npointing it out to the Mexicans, “behold a monster mechanism which\r\nwill quickly annihilate you!” But on trial it proved a failure.\r\n\r\nThen messengers were again despatched to Quauhtemotzin to talk of\r\npeace, and were told that they should have an answer soon. Next day\r\nthe Spanish sentinels observed a great commotion among the Mexicans\r\nand a gathering of armed masses. They gave due notice of this, but\r\nbefore the troops were fully prepared the enemy came rushing from\r\ntheir retreats with a suddenness that threw the first opposing lines\r\nin disorder, a number being wounded and several killed, at least among\r\nthe auxiliaries.[1208] The troops quickly rallied, however, under\r\ncover of the artillery, and Cortés resolved to inflict chastisement.\r\nAlvarado was ordered to attack a large ward containing over a thousand\r\nbuildings, while the remaining forces should turn against the main\r\nquarter. Incited by the presence of the mystic owl and the sacred\r\nsnake-bearer, the Mexicans fought with an indifference to fate that\r\nturned the war into a butchery. When the survivors were driven back\r\nit was ascertained that over twelve thousand Mexicans had been killed\r\nor captured.\r\n\r\nThe promised victory had proved a disastrous defeat, and even the most\r\nhopeful Mexican sank into the depths of despair. This feeling was\r\ngreatly fostered by a strange occurrence about this time, which the\r\nnative records describe as a fiery whirlwind, resolving into flames\r\nand sparks. It rose with great noise in the north, after sunset,\r\nrevolved over the doomed quarter and disappeared in the lake, leaving\r\nthe natives overwhelmed with apprehensions.[1209]\r\n\r\nTheir eyes were fully opened to the situation. And in pondering on\r\nthe dreadful past and present, the dreadful future became dim, even\r\nits terrors growing every day fainter. They had been passive under\r\nthe pain of wounds and under hardships indescribable; but when at last\r\nfrenzied mothers and fathers seized upon their own offspring to still\r\nthe pangs of hunger over which sane minds no longer had control; when\r\nothers began furtively to look about for less closely allied beings\r\nwhereon to feed, then indeed a stranger and more terrible fear came\r\nover them.[1210]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Cortés returned with full force on the following day to renew\r\nthe fight, crowds of miserable beings came forth, repulsive in their\r\nemaciated and haggard appearance, careless of their lives yet clamoring\r\nfor mercy and for bread. Moved by the appeal, he ordered them not to\r\nbe injured, and proceeded to answer certain chiefs who had summoned\r\nhim to a parley. “Son of heaven!” they cried, “within one brief day\r\nand night the tireless orb returns. Why dost not thou also finish thy\r\ntask as quickly? Kill us, so that we may no longer suffer, but enter\r\nparadise and join the happy throng already sent thither!”[1211] He\r\ntold them that in their hands was the remedy. They had but to cease\r\ntheir insane opposition, and their suffering would cease, for he would\r\ngive them food and respect their persons and property. No satisfactory\r\nanswer was returned. They were evidently afraid to speak of peace,\r\nthough eager for it. Cortés felt convinced that the emperor and a\r\nfew leading nobles were the only persons holding back, and willing\r\nto spare the people he again resolved on an appeal.\r\n\r\nA distinguished captive was prevailed on to carry this message in\r\norder to give it more weight,[1212] and to use his influence with the\r\nemperor. On appearing before Quauhtemotzin the noble began to speak\r\nof the kind treatment he had received from the Spaniards. Praise of\r\nthis nature hardly accorded with the mood of the ruler or with the\r\nviews he wished to impart, and no sooner did the envoy allude to\r\npeace than he was ordered away with an imperious sign to the stone\r\nof sacrifice.[1213] Any fate for ruler and people was better than to\r\nfall into the hands of Christian civilization. At the same time the\r\nwarriors faintly threw themselves against the Spaniards with shouts\r\nof “Death or liberty!” The attack cost the besiegers a horse, and\r\nseveral men were wounded, but the charge was easily repelled, and\r\nwas followed up by further slaughter. That night the allies encamped\r\nwithin the city.\r\n\r\nThe following day Cortés again approached some nobles at an\r\nintrenchment and asked, “Why remains the emperor so stubborn? Why will\r\nhe not come and speak with me, and stay the useless slaughter of his\r\nsubjects?” Bound by superstitious loyalty to their ruler, weepingly\r\nthey replied, “We know not; we will speak with him; we can but die!”\r\nPresently they returned to say that Quauhtemotzin would present himself\r\nin the market-place on the following noon. Delighted, Cortés ordered\r\na dais to be prepared on the raised masonry platform recently used\r\nfor the catapult, together with choice viands. At the appointed hour\r\nthe Spanish general appeared in state, with the soldiers drawn up in\r\nline, ready to do honor to the distinguished guest. After waiting\r\nimpatiently for some time, they saw five personages approach, who\r\nproved to be the bearers of excuses. Quauhtemotzin could not come,\r\nbut desired to learn the wishes of Malinche.[1214]\r\n\r\nConcealing his chagrin, Cortés caused the nobles to be entertained,\r\nand then he sent them to their master with assurance of good\r\ntreatment; they soon returned with presents, and said the emperor\r\nwould not come. Again they were sent, and again their efforts were\r\nunavailing. The truth is, Cortés desired with the monarch to secure\r\nhis treasure; else he would not long have stayed his bloody hand. On\r\nthe other hand, though Quauhtemotzin’s conduct might be attributed\r\nto selfish obstinacy, he well knew that even for his people death\r\nwas to be scarcely more feared than capture; now they might at once\r\nenter paradise, but the foreigners sought them but to enslave.\r\n\r\nThe following day the five nobles again kept Cortés waiting with\r\na promise that the emperor would meet him. The hour having passed\r\nwithout his appearance, the allies, who had been kept in the background\r\nduring the negotiations, were called forward and the order was given\r\nfor assault, Sandoval directing the fleet along the shore and up\r\nthe canals to the rear. “Since they will not have peace, they shall\r\nhave war!” cried Cortés. Then the carnage became fearful. Spaniards\r\nand auxiliaries alike, two hundred thousand strong and more, so it\r\nwas said, abandoned themselves to the butchery, while Satan smiled\r\napproval. In helpless despair, like cooped beasts in the shambles, they\r\nreceived the death-blow as a deliverance.[1215] I will not paint the\r\nsickening details so often told of chasms filled, and narrow streets\r\nblockaded high with the dead bodies of the unoffending, while down\r\nupon the living settled desolation. It must indeed have been appalling\r\nwhen he who had brought to pass such horrors writes: “Such was the\r\ncry and weeping of children and women that not one amongst us but\r\nwas moved to the heart.” Then he attempts to throw upon the allies\r\nthe blame of it. “Never,” he says, “was such cruelty seen, beyond\r\nall bounds of nature, as among these natives.” Already, before this\r\nmassacre of forty thousand[1216] the streets and houses were filled\r\nwith human putridity, so that now the Spaniards were forced to burn\r\nthat quarter of the city to save themselves from infection.\r\n\r\nAnother morrow engenders fresh horrors. The three heavy guns are\r\nbrought forward to assist in dislodging the besieged. Fearful lest\r\nthe emperor escape him in canoes, Cortés directs Sandoval to place\r\nvessels on the watch for fugitives, particularly at the basin of\r\nTlatelulco,[1217] into which it is proposed to drive the besieged,\r\nthere to catch the king and nobles with their gold and jewels. Of\r\na truth Cortés does not wish to kill the miserable remnant of this\r\nso lately proud race—particularly if thereby he loses the encaged\r\ntreasure. So he again appeals to them, and the Cihuacoatl,[1218]\r\nchief adviser of the emperor, appears and is treated with great\r\ncourtesy. After a time he takes his departure, then for the first\r\ntime declaring that Quauhtemotzin will on no account present himself.\r\n“Return then,” exclaims Cortés in ill-suppressed anger, “and prepare\r\nfor death, invoked, not by high and holy purpose, but by obstinate\r\ntimidity!”[1219]\r\n\r\nFive hours are thus gained by the wily monarch for the escape of the\r\nwomen and children, who pour out in swarms, the fainting supported by\r\nthe feeble, all emaciated and haggard, and many marked by wounds or\r\ndisease. Seeing which the allies pounce upon them, all stricken and\r\ndefenceless as they are, and murder them, to the number of fifteen\r\nthousand. And the same number perish in the fall of broken bridges,\r\nin the choked canals, and from the tread of their fellow fugitives.\r\nHow glorious is war! How noble the vocation! How truly great the hero\r\nof such hellish deeds! Blush, oh sun! for making such to-morrows; for\r\nlending thy light to human intelligence by which to do such diabolical\r\nwickedness!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nObserving no signs of surrender, Cortés opened fire with his cannon\r\nand gave the signal of attack. Another massacre followed, the\r\nMexicans displaying the same apathy and sullen indifference to death\r\nas on other late occasions. At some points, however, large bodies\r\nsurrendered, and the remaining Mexican quarters were fast falling\r\ninto the conqueror’s hands Sandoval on his side was closely guarding\r\nthe water front and preparing to coöperate. Entering the harbor basin\r\nwith a portion of the fleet, he bore down on the canoes with a crash,\r\nupsetting the greater number, filled chiefly with nobles and their\r\nfamilies, of whom a large portion perished. The canoes which escaped\r\nscattered in different directions, into canals and corners, most of\r\nthem however turning toward a nook of the basin with the brigantines\r\nin hot pursuit. At this moment a few boats of larger build emerged\r\nfrom a retreat at the other end and paddled rapidly toward the open\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nWarned by his commander to watch closely for the emperor, Sandoval\r\nhad not failed to observe the movement, and he immediately directed\r\nGarcía de Holguin, captain of the fastest vessel, to overhaul the\r\nfugitives, who might be persons of note. Aided both by sails and oars,\r\nHolguin speedily gained on them, and they began to scatter in different\r\ndirections, evidently with a view to confuse him; but a captive on\r\nboard indicated one as most likely to contain the emperor.[1220] On\r\napproaching it the archers levelled their cross-bows, whereupon a sign\r\nof surrender was made, with the pleading cry that Quauhtemotzin was\r\nthere. As the overjoyed Holguin stepped down to secure his captives,\r\namong whom were the young empress, the king of Tlacopan, and other\r\nprominent personages,[1221] the monarch bade him respect his consort\r\nand his retinue. As for himself, he was at his disposal.\r\n\r\nConducted by his captor, he passed along the streets to the presence\r\nof the conqueror, the object of ten thousand eyes, for rumor had\r\npreceded him. Men rested from the slaughter to gaze at him. In the\r\ndistance was heard the din of battle, but along the captive’s path\r\nthere fell a hush. His was a striking figure. The grave, careworn face\r\nbetokened suffering. He wore a dingy blood-stained robe, and the pallor\r\nwhich overspread a naturally fair face was yet more heightened by the\r\nfeverish brilliancy of the eyes, now bent dejectedly on the ground,\r\nnow looking straight before him. He walked with a firm step, and young\r\nas he was, the majestic dignity of the prince and leader impressed\r\nevery beholder. “He was quite a gentleman,” graciously affirms Bernal\r\nDiaz. Cortés had stationed himself on the roof of a high building in\r\nthe Amaxac ward,[1222] thence to direct operations, and now he caused\r\na dais to be prepared, and a table with refreshments. When the emperor\r\napproached the guard drew up in line, and the general advanced with\r\nbenign dignity and led him to a seat by his side. “Malinche,” said\r\nthe captive, “I have done all within my power for the defence of my\r\npeople, but the gods have not favored me. My empire is gone, my city\r\nis destroyed, and my vassals are dead. For what have I to live? Rid\r\nme therefore of worthless existence.”[1223] Saying this, with his\r\nhand he touched a dagger in the belt of Cortés. The general sought to\r\nreassure him, declaring that none could resist the Christian’s God.\r\nHe had performed his duty bravely, like a good prince, and should be\r\ntreated as such.\r\n\r\nAlthough the great end was thus accomplished, slaughter and pillage\r\nwere continued until long after vespers. Before the troops withdrew to\r\ntheir respective camps, the prisoners, including the pretty empress,\r\nTecuichpo, were conducted to safe quarters in Coyuhuacan. Shortly\r\nafterward a rain set in, aiding the efforts of the Spaniards to check\r\nthe auxiliaries in their maraudings, and this, developing toward\r\nmidnight into a furious storm with lightning and thunder, seemed\r\nto the homeless Mexicans to be the xiuhcoatl of Huitzilopochtli and\r\nthe tumult of departing deities. To the conquerors this flashing and\r\nthundering of heaven’s artillery was the salvo attending victory,\r\nwhich was celebrated in feasting and merriment till came late slumber\r\nwith visions of gold, and lands, and vassals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus ended Tuesday, the 13th of August 1521, sacred to St Hippolytus,\r\nand accordingly adopted by the conquerors as patron saint of the\r\ncity. During colonial _régime_ the day was annually celebrated by a\r\nsolemn festival, wherein the leading citizens and officials rode on\r\nhorseback in procession round the city, headed by the viceroy and the\r\nalférez mayor bearing a banner commemorative of the conquest.[1224]\r\nFor seventy-five days consecutively, says Cortés,[1225] the siege had\r\nbeen wreathing its coils midst almost hourly scenes of bloodshed,\r\nwherein nearly one thousand Spaniards and two hundred times that\r\nnumber of allies had taken part, one hundred or thereabout of the\r\nformer falling, and many thousands among the latter.[1226]\r\n\r\nAs for the Mexicans, most of the early authorities assert that fully\r\none hundred thousand perished, besides those who died from pest and\r\nfamine.[1227] At the order of their sovereign, after the proclamation\r\nof peace, the miserable remnant began to evacuate their pest-holes,\r\nand to seek the fields adjacent, now lustrous green under refreshing\r\nrains. Ah! it was pitiful, life to them now, this world a great\r\ncharnel-house filled with the bones of their loved ones, and their\r\nhearts dead though still bleeding. What were their sins more than\r\nthose of others, that they should be so stricken, that they should\r\nbe so ground to the dust while the conquerors flushed with victory\r\nwere exulting before God because he had so ordered and accomplished?\r\nThey had sacrificed human beings on the altars of their gods, sixty\r\nthousand in one year, some said. But what were these butcheries of the\r\nSpaniards but human sacrifices, of more than six times sixty thousand\r\nin one year! Behold them as they file along the causeway, the very\r\nsun striking black and stifling on their famine-stricken forms and\r\nagonized faces. On them, then, ye conquerors! Complete your work;\r\nfor in its swift continuance is their earliest rest![1228]\r\n\r\nThe 14th of August the troops entered the surrendered quarters to\r\nreview their work and its results. “I swear,” writes Bernal Diaz,\r\n“that the lake and houses and abodes were so full of bodies and heads\r\nof dead men that I am unable to convey an idea thereof; for in the\r\nstreets and courts of Tlatelulco there were no other things, and we\r\ncould walk only amidst dead bodies.”[1229] Many became sick from\r\nthe stench, and Cortés ordered fires to be lighted to purify the\r\nair. Natives were sent to bring forth the dead, and with them went\r\nSpaniards seeking for gold, silver, precious stones, and plumage,\r\nleaving textile fabrics and other less valued effects to the allies;\r\nbut the quantity known to have been obtained fell far below their\r\nextravagant expectations, and in their disappointment the soldiers\r\nsearched the persons of fugitives, looking into their very mouths\r\nfor hidden gold, says a native record. Bernal Diaz complains that\r\nthe brigantine crews had already plundered the wealthiest persons,\r\nwho were in the canoes, and had sacked the treasure-houses while the\r\nothers were fighting. They in their turn affirmed that the Mexicans\r\nhad cast their treasures into the lake. The mysterious depths harbor\r\nmany secrets, and beneath the waters, round the famed city of the\r\nAztecs, tradition still places glittering deposits of untold extent.\r\n\r\nThree or four days after the fall, Cortés passed over to Coyuhuacan\r\nwith the greater part of his forces, there more formally to celebrate\r\nthe end of the siege in banqueting and thanksgiving. A feature of the\r\nperformance was a solemn procession by all the soldiers, bareheaded,\r\nwith banners, raising their voices in praise to God, who had given\r\nthem the victory, and who was so soon to be worshipped from gulf to\r\nsouthern sea.[1230]\r\n\r\nThe services of the allies being at present no longer needed, Cortés\r\nassembled them to speak farewell. He dwelt in flattering terms on their\r\nbrave and effective deeds. He promised they should be duly represented\r\nto his majesty, who would reward them with singular privileges. To\r\nthe chiefs were then given shields, robes, and other articles, with\r\npromises of more lands and vassals. Then they went their way, happy\r\nin their slaves and spoils, happy in the thought of humbled foe, happy\r\nin the promises of the Spaniards; they did not know, poor simpletons,\r\nthat all along the days and nights of this terrible siege, with sword\r\nand lance on Aztec breast, they had been forging their own fetters,\r\nwhich they and their children long must wear.[1231]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Mexico was less a subjugation by Spanish soldiers\r\nthan their skilful manœuvring of New World forces against one another.\r\nHad Anáhuac been united it would have succumbed less readily, perhaps\r\nnever. As it was, while the native nations were slaying each other,\r\nfighting out their ancient feuds, the astute Spaniards laid their\r\nall-possessing hand upon the country.\r\n\r\nNor was any apology on their part needed before Christendom. Mankind\r\nto this day have not become so humane and just as not to find excuse\r\nfor any wrong within the realms of strength and inclination. What\r\nthen could be expected of an age and nation wherein it was not\r\nuncommon to cloak crime under the fair garb of religion. Hitherto\r\ncame the Spaniards to murder and to rob: to rob and murder in the\r\nname of charity and sweet heaven. No excuses were necessary, however\r\nconvenient to that end came the appeals of the Cempoalans groaning\r\nunder terrible oppression at the hand of a race delighting in blood\r\nand extortion; a race which within two centuries had risen from a\r\ndegrading servitude largely by means of intrigue and treachery; a\r\nrace stamped with ignoble characteristics born of serfdom, and eager\r\nto retaliate on others for their past humiliation, yet energetic,\r\nenterprising, and advancing with rapid strides along the pathway\r\nof indigenous culture. Ambitious to rule, they sent their armies to\r\nbring province after province under the yoke. Rapacious collectors\r\nfollowed to press the substance out of the people, for the appetite\r\nof themselves and their masters. Confiscation, enslavement, and\r\ndesolation marched in the train, and the fairest hopes of the land\r\nwere dragged away in bondage, and to bleed on the stone of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nTo all these appalling evils the Totonacs, among others, were exposed,\r\nwhen soldiers appeared on their shores bearing aloft the symbol of\r\ncharity, of deliverance. The crushed family appealed to them, also the\r\nwrithing slaves, for from the altars of hideous idols rose the dying\r\nshrieks of youths and maidens. But a short time before knights of\r\ndifferent orders swarmed over Europe, the professed champions of the\r\noppressed; and the spirit of the crusaders still lingered in Spain,\r\nin form if nothing more; and what Christian soldier could unheedingly\r\nview such outrages!\r\n\r\nMontezuma and his people were inhuman monsters, and Grotius,\r\nMontesquieu, and others who should know, say that war in behalf of\r\nhumanity is a duty;[1232] and this notwithstanding the remedy be\r\ntenfold more inhuman than the disease.\r\n\r\nNot that the Spaniards were insincere in their proffers of such\r\nexcuses; duty comes to us in the color of our desires. Moreover,\r\nthey were fresh from the Moorish wars; they were imbued with a\r\nreligious exaltation and chivalric sentiment that placed before them\r\nin varied light duty to their God, their king, and themselves. For\r\ncenturies they had been trained to devote life and possessions to\r\nadvance the interests of sovereign and church. Many of the noblest\r\ncharacteristics were interwoven in the nature of Cortés, and also\r\nwith admirable distinctness in such men as Juan Velazquez, Sandoval,\r\nand Puertocarrero. In others we find the dignity of the hidalgo\r\nupheld without marked stain, and this notwithstanding the tendency\r\nto intrigue, the disregard for truth and justice, and a yielding to\r\ncertain vices on the part of leaders, and the greed and brutality\r\nof rank and file. But even among the common soldiers, in fairness we\r\ncannot disregard the echo of noble sentiment, the aspiration toward\r\nhigh emprise there present. It is the leader, however, who with all\r\nhis selfish cruelties and unprincipled trickeries must ever remain\r\nthe central figure of our admiration. If ever there was a hero, a\r\ngenius of war worthy the adoration of war worshippers, if ever there\r\nwere grand conception and achievement, all were vividly displayed in\r\nthe mind and person of Hernan Cortés.\r\n\r\nAn able French writer, comparing the siege of Mexico with that of\r\nTroy, depicts Cortés as an Achilles in whom were combined the talents\r\nof Agamemnon and Ulysses.[1233]\r\n\r\nIn some respects, and as compared with his companions, he indeed\r\napproached the deity the Mexicans thought him. Behold him out upon\r\nthis venture, throwing life to the winds that waft him from Cuba,\r\nsinking his ships behind him, plunging into the heart of a hostile\r\ncountry, and with a handful of men opposing powerful armies, quelling\r\ninsurrections, capturing his captors, turning enemies into allies,\r\nbalancing upon his finger contending powers, and after the grand\r\ncataclysm opened by him on the central plateau has spent itself,\r\nhe quietly pockets the prize. No Alexander, or Scipio, or Cæsar, or\r\nNapoleon ever achieved results so vast with means so insignificant.\r\nIt was indeed a rare piracy!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the testimony of eye-witnesses and the early\r\nchroniclers on the conquest may be considered as fully up to the\r\naverage of historical evidence. While there was no little exaggeration,\r\nand some downright mendacity, such were the number of the witnesses,\r\nthe time, place, and circumstances of their several relations, and the\r\nclearness of their testimony, that we find no difficulty with regard\r\nto any important matters in determining truth and falsehood. When in\r\naddition to the writings of the Spaniards we have native records and\r\narchitectural remains as collateral evidence, every honest searcher\r\nafter truth may be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the two writers by the name of Diaz who accompanied\r\nthe first expedition to Mexico, I have spoken of the _Itinerario\r\nde Grijalva_ of the priest, and before closing this volume I will\r\nreview the _Historia Verdadera_ of the soldier. Following these were\r\nthe memorials of the relatives of Velazquez, wholly unreliable; the\r\nrelation of the Anonymous Conqueror, whose statements were for the\r\nmost part true; many documents, such as the _Carta del Ejército_, and\r\n_Probanza de Lejalde_, as well as the _Cartas de Cortés_, in the main\r\ntrue, but which may properly be accepted only after close scrutiny\r\nand careful comparison; the reports of Zurita, and the innumerable\r\npapers and documents lately brought to light by Navarrete, Ramirez,\r\nIcazbalceta, Ternaux-Compans, and others, and published as _Coleccion\r\nde Documentos Inéditos_, _Coleccion de Documentos para la Historia de\r\nMexico_, etc.; native and Spanish historians, Tezozomoc, Camargo, and\r\nIxtlilxochitl; Duran, Veytia, Sahagun, Mendieta, and Las Casas; Oviedo,\r\nPeter Martyr, and Gomara; Herrera, Torquemada, Solis, and Clavigero;\r\nBustamante, Robertson, Prescott, and Brasseur de Bourbourg. These\r\nand others of but little inferior importance offer ample foundation\r\non which the modern historian may safely rear his superstructure.\r\n\r\nI say that it is easy enough to determine truth from falsehood in such\r\na study as this, where the evidence is so abundant and the witnesses\r\nare so widely separated. When Torquemada enters into a long argument\r\nto show that the misery wrought by the conquest was the punishment\r\nby God for the vices of the Mexicans, I do not discuss the matter. I\r\nwillingly admit that the ancient historian knew, if indeed he knew\r\nanything about it, more concerning the mind of the deity than the\r\nmodern, though the latter might ask if the sufferings of the Spaniards\r\nwere not in like manner on account of their vices.\r\n\r\nThe books treating of Cortés’ achievements, as I have said, form an\r\nimmense array, as may be expected from the importance and interest\r\nof what Robertson justly terms “the most memorable event in the\r\nconquest of America,” involving the subjugation of the richest and\r\nmost advanced country therein, the fall of its beautiful and renowned\r\ncity, and one of the most daring campaigns ever undertaken. The\r\nnarrative reads indeed like a romance rather than history based on\r\nstern facts, and it is not strange that men have arisen who seek to\r\ncast doubt, not alone on certain incidents, but on the main features\r\nof the achievement and the field.\r\n\r\nOne method of doubt has been to lower the estimate of native culture\r\nand resources; to sneer at the large cities, magnificent palaces,\r\nregal state, certain industrial and fine arts, picture-writing, and\r\nother evidences of a higher culture. Such statements reveal to the\r\nexperienced student a lamentable disregard or ignorance of evidence\r\nextant, of ruins with their massive form, their beautifully designed\r\nornamentation, their admirable sculptured and plastic delineation of\r\nthe human figure, both far in advance of the conventional specimens\r\nof Egypt, and the former equal in many respects to the productions of\r\nthe higher Greek art. The picture-writing, again, reveals the phonetic\r\nelement so developed as to endow the Mexicans with that high proof of\r\nculture, written records, applied not only to historic incidents and\r\ncommon facts, but to abstract subjects of philosophic, scientific,\r\nand poetic nature, as instanced in my _Native Races_.\r\n\r\nIt needed not the official investigation instituted by the Spanish\r\ngovernment to confirm the mute testimony of relics, and the vivid\r\ndeclaration of chroniclers. Native records exist in sufficient\r\nabundance to speak for themselves; records written by and for the\r\npeople, and therefore free from any suspicion of misrepresentation;\r\nrecords used by a number of writers for obtaining that insight into\r\nesoteric features of Nahua institutions which could not well be\r\nacquired by Spaniards. The translation of these records, as reproduced\r\nin the volumes of Sahagun, Ixtlilxochitl, Kingsborough, and others,\r\nwith copies of original paintings, have been carefully used both\r\nfor the _Native Races_ and the histories of Mexico and Guatemala,\r\nand introduced indeed more thoroughly in this series as evidence\r\nthan by any modern writer on the subject, not excepting the learned\r\nAbbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, though unlike this enthusiast I have not\r\nallowed myself to accept this evidence with the same non-critical\r\nbias. I have merely used it for what it is worth, after applying\r\nsevere analytic tests. Certain points may be covered by merely one\r\nor two authorities; but even then the erudite student will readily\r\ndetermine the value of the testimony from internal evidence, while in\r\nthe generality of cases he will find a number of versions by natives\r\nand Spaniards, by partisans and rivals, whose contradictions will\r\naid him in determining the truth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a previous bibliographic note I have pointed out the many internal\r\nevidences furnished by the letters of Cortés, of undoubted reliability\r\non most points, in their minuteness, their frank soldierly tone, and\r\nother features. They are besides confirmed in all the more essential\r\npoints by the contemporaneous letters from the municipality of Villa\r\nRica and the army, the sworn depositions before the royal notary by\r\nleading officers, the narratives of Andrés de Tápia, and others. Still\r\nstronger confirmation is given in the complaints and memorials issued\r\nby enemies and rivals of the great captain, who in their efforts to\r\ndetract from his character and achievements provide the historian\r\nwith material that enables him to avoid the pitfalls abounding\r\neven in the honest narratives of partisans, either from sympathy,\r\nfrom lack of thorough knowledge, or from hearsay. Such testimony\r\nis abundant in the residencia investigations of Cortés, Alvarado,\r\nGuzman, and others, all which contain voluminous testimony on the\r\nmost important questions. Prescott’s opportunities for consulting new\r\nmaterial were vastly superior to those of his predecessors. If mine\r\nhave been correspondingly greater, it may perhaps to some extent be\r\ndue to the example set by him in his earnest researches, and because\r\nsince the publication of his volumes, private individuals and learned\r\nsocieties have striven with increased enthusiasm to bring to light\r\nhidden material, notably from the rich archives of Spain and certain\r\nLatin-American states.\r\n\r\nFrom this mass of what may be termed documentary evidence we turn\r\nto the regular historians and narrators, beginning with Peter Martyr\r\nand Oviedo, who both adhere chiefly to Cortés, though the latter adds\r\nother versions by different eye-witnesses. Sahagun’s account contains\r\na strange admixture of native absurdities and vague recollections\r\nof converted soldiers. A more complete version is given by Gomara,\r\nthe biographer of the great captain, who had access to private and\r\npublic archives and individual narratives now lost; but he frequently\r\ncolors the incidents to the credit of his hero and his profession.\r\nNevertheless the value of the text is testified to by his Mexican\r\ntranslator Chimalpain, who adds some interesting facts from native\r\nrecords and personal knowledge. The Tezcucan writer Ixtlilxochitl\r\nalso follows him pretty closely for the Spanish side, while the\r\narchives left him by his royal ancestors and different narratives\r\nfurnish the other side, frequently absurd and highly colored. Camargo\r\ngives a rather brief Tlascaltec version. Gomara’s coloring, which,\r\nin accordance with the method of most historians, leaves the credit\r\nfor achievements with the leader, roused the feelings of more than\r\none of the soldiers who had shared in the glories of that period,\r\nand Bernal Diaz promptly began to write his celebrated _Historia\r\nVerdadera_, which professes to tell the true story and rectify in\r\nparticular the so-called blunders of Gomara. Although this profession\r\nis not always to be relied on, the story is most valuable from its\r\nexceeding completeness, its many new facts, and its varied version.\r\nNot long after, Herrera, the official historiographer, began his\r\ndecades, wherein for the conquest he uses the material already\r\nprinted, with a leaning toward Gomara, yet with several additional\r\nnarratives to perfect his own revised version, notably that of Ojeda,\r\na leading officer under Cortés, and also no small mass of material\r\nfrom the archives of Spain. Torquemada copies him for the most part,\r\nthough he adds much native testimony from Sahagun, from a Tezcucan\r\nwriter, and others, making his account of the conquest the most\r\ncomplete up to that time. Solis elaborates with little critique,\r\nand with a verboseness and grandiloquence that tire. Vetancurt’s\r\nversion is comparatively brief, with few additions, and Robertson’s\r\nis a brilliant summary; but Clavigero, while adding not much to\r\nTorquemada’s bulky account, presents it in quite a new form, pruned\r\nof verboseness, re-arranged in a masterly manner, and invested with\r\na philosophic spirit altogether superior to anything presented till\r\nPrescott’s time. On the above historians and some of Cortés’ letters\r\nare founded the immense array of minor accounts and summaries on the\r\nconquest, both in separate and embodied form, some of them provided\r\nwith occasional observations, but for the great part they contain\r\nnothing of any value to the student. Those after Prescott’s time\r\nfollow him as a rule. Mexican accounts might naturally be expected to\r\npresent useful features, but such is hardly the case. Alaman, Ramirez,\r\nIcazbalceta, Orozco y Berra, Bustamante, and certain writers in the\r\nBoletin of the Mexican Geographical Society, have brought to light\r\nseveral documents and monographs bearing on particular incidents and\r\nfeatures; but no complete account of real value has been written,\r\nCarbajal’s pretentious version being almost wholly a plagiarism from\r\nClavigero, Mora’s a hasty compilation, and so on. As for the new bulky\r\nSpanish version by Zamacois, it is not only verbose but superficial\r\nand narrow in its research, blundering even where Prescott points\r\nthe way, and representing more a feuilleton issue than a history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBernal Diaz del Castillo is, as I have said, the main historian of\r\nthe conquest, from the exhaustive thoroughness of his material, as\r\ncompared with other original writers, and from his participation in\r\nall its leading scenes, including the discovery voyages. For about\r\nhalf a century he survives, and sees comrade after comrade disappear\r\nfrom the field till but five of Cortés’ original company remain, “all\r\nof us very old, suffering from infirmities, and very poor, burdened\r\nwith sons and daughters to marry, and grandchildren, and with but a\r\nsmall income; and thus we pass our days in toil and misery.” He is not\r\nso badly off, however, as he would have us believe, for a comfortable\r\nencomienda supplies every want, and numerous descendants throng round\r\nto minister to his comfort and listen to his tales. But as he recalls\r\nthe great achievements wherein he participated, he swells with the\r\nimportance of the events, and dwelling on the multiplied treasures\r\nhe has assisted to capture, the reward sinks to insignificance. It\r\nis but the chronic grumble, however, of an old soldier that half the\r\ncontinent would not satisfy. Springing from a poor and humble family\r\nof Medina del Campo, in old Castile, he had embarked at an early age\r\nwith the expedition of Pedrarias in 1514 to seek fortune in Darien.\r\nFailing there, he drifts to Cuba in time to join the discovery parties\r\nof Córdoba and Grijalva. Subsequently he enlists under Cortés as a\r\ncommon soldier, yet somewhat above the mass in the favor of his chief.\r\n“Soldado distinguido,” says Juarros, implying higher birth; but this\r\nis doubtful. There is hardly a prominent incident of the conquest\r\nin which he does not participate, being present in no less than one\r\nhundred and nineteen battles, according to his enumeration, whereof\r\nmany a scar remains to bear witness, and many a trophy to attest his\r\nvalor. In due time he receives his share of repartimientos of land and\r\nserfs, and settles in Goazacoalco as regidor, with sufficient means to\r\nfeed a taste that procures for him the not ill-esteemed nickname of\r\nDandy. From his life of contentment, though not equal to his claims,\r\nhe is torn by the Honduras expedition under Cortés, who gives him at\r\ntimes the command of a small party, whence comes the sported title of\r\ncaptain. Afterward for a time he drifts about, and finally settles\r\nin Guatemala city with the rank of regidor perpétuo, and with a\r\nrespectable encomienda, obtained partly through the representations of\r\nCortés to the king. He marries Teresa, daughter of Bartolomé Becerra,\r\none of the founders of the city, and repeatedly its alcalde, and has\r\nseveral children, whose descendants survive to witness the overthrow\r\nof the royal banner planted by their forefather. Grandsons figure as\r\ndeans of the city church, and an historian of the adopted country\r\nrises in Fuentes y Guzman. _Pinelo_, _Epitome_, ii. 604; _Gonzalez\r\nDávila_, _Teatro Ecles._, i. 177; _Memorial de Conquistadores_, in\r\n_Monumentos Admin. Munic._, MS.; _Juarros_, _Guat._, i. 338, 350;\r\n_Torquemada_, i. 351.\r\n\r\nThe leisure afforded him in Guatemala, broken by little save the\r\ninspection of his estate, gave opportunity for indulging in the\r\nreveries of by-gone days. Histories of achievements were nearly all\r\nconnected with the great Cortés, famed on every lip; yet that fame\r\nhad been acquired with the aid of soldiers who like himself had\r\nbeen consigned to an obscure corner of the vast domains conquered by\r\nthem. It did not seem right to the scarred veteran that the fruits\r\nof combined toil should fall to one or two alone; that he himself\r\nshould be regarded far less than hundreds of upstarts whose only\r\ndeeds had been to reap the field won by him and his comrades. He\r\nwould tell his tale at all events; and forthwith he began to arrange\r\nthe notes formed during his career, and to uplift the curtains of\r\nmemory for retrospective views. While thus occupied he came upon the\r\nhistory by Gomara, and perceiving “his great rhetoric, and my work\r\nso crude, I stopped writing, and even felt ashamed to let it appear\r\namong notable persons.” But finding that the biographer of Cortés\r\nhad committed many blunders, and had colored the narrative on behalf\r\nof his patron, he again seized the pen, with the double purpose of\r\ncorrecting such errors and of vindicating his slighted comrades.\r\nFaithfully he carried out his plan, recording name after name of\r\nbrave fellows who shed lustre on the flag, who freely risked their\r\nlives in gallant encounters, or who gave their last breath for church\r\nand king. While dwelling lovingly on humble companions, whose cause\r\nhe espoused, he detracts little from the leaders and cavaliers. He\r\ndescribes their appearance and traits with a graphic fidelity that\r\nseems to bring them before us in person; he freely accords them every\r\ncredit, and if he spares not their vices they are seldom brought\r\nforward in a captious or ill-natured spirit. On the contrary, he\r\nfrequently covers disagreeable facts in deference to the dead. This\r\ngeneral fairness of dealing is particularly noticeable in regard to\r\nCortés, whom nevertheless he sometimes severely criticises; and while\r\nDiaz assumes for his side the credit of many a suggestion and deed,\r\nyet he is ever the loyal soldier, and frequently takes up the cudgel\r\nin behalf of the honored leader when others seek to assail him. He\r\nadmires the great captain hardly less than himself. Indeed, to say\r\nthat the old campaigner was vain is stating it mildly. Two licentiates\r\nwho read the manuscript pointed this out to him, but he replied, “Whom\r\ndoes it harm? No one praises an old, broken-down soldier, so I must\r\neven praise myself. It is a duty I owe not only to my fair name but\r\nto my descendants.” He revives in his narrative and carries us back\r\nwith him to those stirring days, depicting now the hardships of the\r\nmarch, now the new countries and races that appear; then he enters\r\ninto the heat of battle with a fidelity that brings the din and\r\nturmoil vividly before us; and anon we see the adventurers in camp,\r\nin their social relations, relieved by pleasing episodes. He enters\r\nthoroughly into their hopes and feelings, deeds and life; he grows\r\neloquent and pathetic by turns, and reveals also the undercurrent of\r\npiety and zeal which pervaded the rakish crew. Here is the gossipy\r\nfrankness of Herodotus, illumined by many a quaint observation and\r\nmany a blunt sally. Bernal Diaz had but the rudiments of education,\r\nwhich nevertheless was above the average among his fellow-soldiers;\r\nbut he had evidently read a little in later years, to judge by his\r\nallusions to classic history, though not enough to acquire more than\r\na mediocre proficiency in grammar. There is a minuteness of detail\r\nat times wearisome, and garrulous digression and repetition; but a\r\nsimple perspicuity pervades the whole narrative, which makes it easy\r\nto follow, while the frankness and frequent animation are pleasing.\r\nMuch of it appears to have been dictated, perhaps to some one of\r\nhis children, “cuyo manuscrito se conserva en el archivo de esta\r\nmunicipalidad.” _Jil_, in _Gaceta Nic._, June 24, 1865. It was given\r\nfor perusal to different persons, and several copies made; but none\r\ncared to assume its publication. Sixty years later, however, Friar\r\nAlonso Remon, chronicler of the Merced order in Spain, found one set\r\nin the library of Ramirez del Prado, of the Council of the Indies,\r\nand perceiving the importance of the narrative, he caused it to be\r\nprinted at Madrid in 1632 under the title of _Historia Verdadera de\r\nla Conquista de la Nueva-España_. Remon dying during the publication,\r\nFriar Gabriel Adarzo, “nunc Hydruntinus præsul,” _Antonio_, _Bib.\r\nHisp. Nova_, iii. 224, took it in charge. Several discrepancies\r\nindicate that revisions have been made, and Vazquez, _Chron. Guat._,\r\n524, whose jealousy as a friar was aroused by allusions to Father\r\nOlmedo, Cortés’ companion, compared the print with the original copy\r\nand pointed out several differences. A second edition, bearing the\r\ndate 1632, though published later probably, contains an additional\r\nchapter on omens, which appears in others of the many editions and\r\ntranslations issued in different countries, even of late years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most clear-sighted writer on Mexico during the last\r\ncentury was Francisco Javier Clavigero, himself a native of that\r\ncountry, and born at Vera Cruz in 1731. His father was a Leonese,\r\nwhose official duties called him to different parts of the country,\r\nand young Francisco profited by this to acquire a knowledge of\r\nits resources and idioms. After a novitiate of three years at the\r\nJesuit college of Tepozotlan, he passed to that at Puebla, and there\r\nstudied philosophy and theology, and showed particular fondness for\r\nlanguages, both classic and native. He taught rhetoric and philosophy\r\nin the principal schools of the country, though restricted somewhat\r\nby the superiors in his too liberal ideas, for which Mexico was not\r\nyet considered ripe. Meanwhile his enthusiasm centred on the study\r\nof Aztec history and hieroglyphs, which received a serious check in\r\nthe expulsion of Jesuits from America in 1767. He sought refuge in\r\nItaly, staying chiefly at Bologna, where he founded an academy, and\r\nhaving considerable leisure he began to shape the results of his late\r\nstudies, impelled in no small degree by the writings of De Pauw and\r\nRobertson, which grated on his patriotic spirit. They were prepared\r\nin Spanish, but the authorities giving no encouragement for their\r\npublication in Spain, an Italian translation was made and issued in\r\nfour volumes, as _Storia Antica del Messico_, Cesena, 1780, dedicated\r\nto the university at Mexico. Subsequently a Spanish version appeared,\r\nbut not before several editions had been published in England and\r\nother countries. The first volume treats of resources and ancient\r\nhistory, the second of manners and customs, the third of the conquest,\r\nand the fourth consists of a series of dissertations on the origin of\r\nthe Americans, on chronology, physique, languages, and other points.\r\nThey have been widely quoted, and Francisco Carbajal de Espinosa has\r\nshown such appreciation of it as to copy almost the whole text in what\r\nhe calls his _Historia de Mexico_, Mex., 1856, 2 vols. Clavigero’s\r\nwork is based to a great extent on aboriginal records and personal\r\nobservation, and the old chronicles have been largely used; but their\r\ncumbrous and confused material is here arranged in a manner worthy of\r\nthe liberal-minded philosopher and rhetorician. Indeed, no previous\r\nwork in this field can at all compare with it for comprehensiveness\r\nand correctness, depth of thought and clearness of expression. In the\r\nformer respect he greatly surpasses Robertson and in the latter he\r\nmay be classed as his equal. His death, which took place at Bologna in\r\n1787, found him in the midst of a number of literary projects, called\r\nforth in part by the success of the _Storia_, and by the different\r\nsubjects which he had therein touched but lightly. Among these works\r\nwas the _Storia della California_, issued at Venice two years after\r\nhis death. It will be noticed in due order.\r\n\r\nThere can be no more fitting close to this volume on the conquest\r\nof Mexico than a tribute of esteem to William Hickling Prescott. I\r\nhave noted in a previous volume his amiable weakness, incident to\r\nthe times rather than to the man, of intensifying the character of\r\nprominent personages so as to present the good better and the bad\r\nworse than they truly were, in order to render his narrative stronger\r\nand more interesting than it would be otherwise; but this is nothing\r\nas compared with his general fairness, united with a magnificent\r\nstyle and philosophic flow of thought. I have noted some inaccuracies\r\nand contradictions in his history, but these are nothing as compared\r\nwith his general care and correctness as a writer. I have mentioned\r\nmaterial which he lacked, but this is nothing as compared with the\r\ngreat mass of fresh evidence which he brought to enrich his subject.\r\nWords fail to express my admiration of the man, the scholar, the\r\nauthor. Apart from the din and dust of ordinary life, he lived as\r\none in the world but not of it, pure of mind, gentle of heart, and\r\nsurpassingly eloquent.\r\n\r\nMr Prescott was born at Salem, Massachusetts, May 4, 1796. His\r\nfather, a lawyer of rising reputation, then thirty-four years of age,\r\nremoved his family to Boston in 1808. At the age of fifteen William\r\nentered Harvard College. While engaged in a boyish frolic one day\r\nduring his junior year a large hard piece of bread, thrown probably\r\nat random, struck full in his left eye, forever depriving him of its\r\nuse. Pursuing his studies with his wonted cheerfulness, he graduated\r\nin 1814, and entered upon the study of law in his father’s office. In\r\n1815 a rheumatic inflammation settled in his right eye, now his sole\r\ndependence, causing him much pain and anxiety. A change of climate\r\nhaving been determined upon, he embarked for the Azores, on a visit to\r\nhis grandfather Hickling, then United States consul at Saint Michael.\r\nThere he remained about six months, confined the greater part of the\r\ntime to a dark room. In April 1816 he embarked for London, crossed\r\nto Paris, made the usual Italian tour, and the following year, his\r\neye becoming worse, he returned home. But hope for the restoration of\r\nhis sight still lingered, and the marvellous buoyancy of his spirits\r\nnever deserted him. A devoted sister cheered the long hours of his\r\nsolitude by readings from his favorite authors. A literary venture\r\nmade at this time in a contribution to the _North American Review_\r\nfailed; his manuscript was returned, and his sister, alone in the\r\nsecret, was enjoined to silence.\r\n\r\nLeaving his darkened chamber and mingling again with society, of\r\nwhich he was ever a bright ornament, he became attached to a daughter\r\nof Thomas C. Amory, a Boston merchant, whom he married on his\r\ntwenty-fourth birthday.\r\n\r\nMr Prescott now abandoned the hope of the entire restoration of his\r\neye. If by restrictions of diet and dieting and by persistent open-air\r\nexercise he might preserve a partial use of the organ he would rest\r\ncontent. And thus he passed the remainder of his life. At times he\r\nwas in almost total darkness, but ordinarily he could read and revise\r\nhis manuscripts; for the purpose of writing, however, he was obliged\r\nto use a noctograph.\r\n\r\nPossessing strong literary tastes, and an aversion to law, Mr Prescott\r\ndetermined upon literature as a pursuit, and in 1826, with the aid of\r\na secretary, he began a systematic course of reading for a history of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella. For three years and a half he pursued this\r\npreparatory labor; in 1829 he began writing, publishing the work in\r\n1837. Ten of the best years of his life Mr Prescott claims to have\r\ndevoted to this book; and for the use of the stereotype-plates, which\r\nMr Prescott supplied at his own cost, and the right to publish twelve\r\nhundred and fifty copies, the American Stationers’ Company agreed to\r\npay the sum of one thousand dollars. But money was not the author’s\r\nobject. The publication in London was offered to John Murray and to\r\nthe Longmans, and was declined by both. Bentley finally became the\r\nLondon publisher. The work was well received on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic; it was translated into several languages, and procured for\r\nthe author at once a world-wide reputation. The _Conquest of Mexico_\r\nwas a worthy outgrowth of so splendid a creation as the _Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella_. The year following the publication of his first work, and\r\nafter having sent to Spain and Mexico for materials for histories of\r\nthe conquests of Mexico and Peru, Mr Prescott learned accidentally that\r\nMr Irving was engaged on similar work. He wrote Irving, acquainting\r\nhim of the fact, and the latter retired gracefully from the field.\r\nIn 1843 the _Conquest of Mexico_ appeared, under the auspices of the\r\nHarpers, who paid $7500 for the use of the plates and the right to\r\npublish 5000 copies. The _Conquest of Peru_ was published in 1847;\r\n_Philip the Second_ in 1855-8; and _Robertson’s Charles the Fifth_\r\nin 1856. Mr Prescott died of apoplexy in the sixty-third year of his\r\nage.\r\n\r\nFor his _Conquest of Mexico_, besides all printed material extant,\r\nMr Prescott drew upon a large mass of new information in manuscript,\r\nfrom several sources, notably from the valuable collection of Muñoz,\r\nbrought together for an intended history of America; that of Vargas\r\nPonce, obtained chiefly from Seville archives; that of Navarrete,\r\npresident of the Royal Academy of History at Madrid; and the archives\r\nof Cortés’ heirs, all of which shed new light on almost every\r\nsection of the subject. His deep research, manifest throughout in\r\ncopious foot-notes, is especially displayed in the very appropriate\r\nintroduction on Mexican civilization, which enables the reader to gain\r\nan intimate knowledge of the people whose subjugation he follows. Good\r\njudgment is also attested in the dissertation on the moot question of\r\nthe origin of this culture, wherein he prudently abstains from any\r\ndecided conclusions. The fact of occasional inaccuracies cannot be\r\nseverely criticised when we consider the infirmity under which the\r\nauthor labored. Since his time so great a mass of material has been\r\nbrought to light that the aspect of history is much changed. This\r\nnew material consists partly of native records, and it is due to his\r\nunacquaintance with these records that a great lack is implied in his\r\npages. The fact that Prescott relied too much on Spanish material\r\nmay account for the marked bias in favor of the conquerors in many\r\ninstances where strict impartiality might be expected, and for the\r\ncondemnatory and reflective assertions which at times appear in direct\r\ncontradiction to previous lines of thought. At times, as if aware of\r\nthis tendency, he assumes a calmness that ill fits the theme, giving\r\nit the very bias he seeks to avoid. Yet with all this it is safe to\r\nsay that few histories have been written in which the qualities of\r\nphilosopher and artist are so happily blended.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n     [1190] Herrera, dec. iii. lib. ii. cap. ii., lib. i. cap.\r\n     xx., places this incident on the third day of entry into\r\n     the city.\r\n\r\n     [1191] ‘Todos los mas principales y esforzados y valientes.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 244. And 2000 captives. _Ixtlilxochitl_,\r\n     _Hor. Crueldades_, 43. ‘Tuuieron bien q̄ cenar aquella noche\r\n     los Indios nuestros amigos,’ observes Gomara, unctuously.\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 209. Bernal Diaz, who claims to have been\r\n     among the 100 select, intimates that Alvarado also formed an\r\n     ambuscade that day, though less effective. _Hist. Verdad._,\r\n     153-4. In rushing from the hiding-place, says Cortés, two\r\n     horses collided, one of them throwing its rider and charging\r\n     alone amid the foe. After receiving several wounds it sought\r\n     refuge among the soldiers and was conducted to camp, where\r\n     it died.\r\n\r\n     [1192] ‘Fué bien principal causa para que la ciudad mas\r\n     presto se ganase,’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 245, but this must\r\n     be regarded as an exaggerated estimate.\r\n\r\n     [1193] _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. ii. cap. ii. Torquemada,\r\n     i. 560, 564, wavers, intimating in one place that all were\r\n     determined to die. When the people at last inclined to\r\n     peace, says Gomara, Quauhtemotzin opposed it on the ground\r\n     that they had once decided for war, ‘contra su voluntad y\r\n     consejo.’ _Hist. Mex._, 213. Most of the revelation was made\r\n     by a woman of rank, it appears. Carried away by his love\r\n     for hero-painting, Prescott has either missed or ignored\r\n     the facts which now reveal his false coloring.\r\n\r\n     [1194] ‘Y asi escondidas huvo algunos Principales de las\r\n     Provincias cercanas que acudieron con algun maiz para solo\r\n     llevar joyas.’ That is, where the cruisers allowed such\r\n     smuggling. _Duran_, _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 497.\r\n\r\n     [1195] About 1000 were killed, says Ixtlilxochitl, _Hor.\r\n     Crueldades_, 44; but Cortés puts the killed and captured\r\n     at more than 800. _Cartas_, 245.\r\n\r\n     [1196] ‘Osauan nuestros vergantines romper las estacadas\r\n     ... remauan con gran fuerça y ... a todas velas.’ _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 150.\r\n\r\n     [1197] ‘De la Capitana, que èl havia salvado,’ says Herrera,\r\n     while asserting that the captain Villafuerte abandoned her;\r\n     but this hardly agrees with his own later statements that\r\n     Villafuerte remained in charge of the fleet, dec. iii.\r\n     lib. i. cap. xxi.; lib. ii. cap. viii. The slain leader\r\n     is called the lieutenant-general of Quauhtemotzin, and\r\n     his death ‘fue causa, que mas presto se ganase la Ciudad,’\r\n     _Torquemada_, i. 558, all of which is doubtful. A similar\r\n     reward to that of Lopez was accorded on another occasion\r\n     to a soldier named Andrés Nuñez, who after the captain had\r\n     abandoned his vessel led her to the rescue of two consorts.\r\n     When the commander came to resume his post Nuñez refused\r\n     to admit him, saying that he had forfeited it. On being\r\n     appealed to, Cortés sustained the brave fellow and gave\r\n     him the command, in which capacity he rendered important\r\n     service. _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. ii. cap. i.\r\n\r\n     [1198] July 25th, according to Clavigero, while Torquemada\r\n     less correctly makes it August 5th.\r\n\r\n     [1199] The Spanish corruption of Quauhtemotzin. ‘La calle\r\n     qᵉ ba al tianguiz de Tlatelulco qᵉ se llama de Guatimosa.’\r\n     _Libro de Cabildo_, MS., 88.\r\n\r\n     [1200] Herrera names Magallanes as one of those who succumbed\r\n     under the onslaught of a chief, but his death was avenged\r\n     by Diego Castellanos, a noted marksman. dec. iii. lib. i.\r\n     cap. xx. On this occasion Ixtlilxochitl intimates that his\r\n     namesake captured his brother, the usurper king of Tezcuco,\r\n     and surrendering him to Cortés, he was at once secured with\r\n     shackles. _Hor. Crueldades_, 42-3. ‘De manera que de cuatro\r\n     partes de la ciudad, las tres estaban ya por nosotros.’\r\n     _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 246.\r\n\r\n     [1201] At the corner of the street leading to Sandoval’s\r\n     quarter. _Id._, 247.\r\n\r\n     [1202] I knew three of them, writes Bernal Diaz. ‘Las\r\n     enterramos en vna Iglesia, que se dize aora los Mártires.’\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 153.\r\n\r\n     [1203] For a full description see _Native Races_, ii. 382\r\n     et seq.\r\n\r\n     [1204] Cortés saw the smoke from his camp, from which\r\n     he was preparing to start. _Cartas_, 247. Herrera leaves\r\n     the impression that Alférez Montaño captured the temple,\r\n     dec. iii. lib. ii. cap. i., but he was probably only the\r\n     first to step on the summit. Bernal Diaz, who fought under\r\n     Alvarado, states distinctly that Badajoz led the party, but\r\n     he is no doubt incorrect in adding that the fight on the\r\n     top continued till night. _Hist. Verdad._, 153. Torquemada,\r\n     i. 565, refers to the temple as the Acatliyacapan. Duran\r\n     makes Cortés appeal to the Chalcans, and they ‘tomando\r\n     la delantera del Ejército, y con ellos Yxtlilxachitl ...\r\n     ganaron el Cue grande.’ _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 506. This\r\n     must be a Chalcan version.\r\n\r\n     [1205] _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 210. Cortés calls them wounded\r\n     merely. Sahagun’s native version of the plaza fight is very\r\n     confusing, and mixed with that of the struggle against the\r\n     other divisions, ‘y tomaron los bergantines [two] á los\r\n     españoles, y lleváronlos á una laguna que llaman _Amanalco_.’\r\n     _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 202-3. But this must be a mistake.\r\n\r\n     [1206] ‘Que se llama Atenantitech, donde ahora està edificada\r\n     la Iglesia de la Concepcion, junto de la Albarrada.’\r\n     _Torquemada_, i. 553. Tetenamitl ward, says Sahagun in one\r\n     edition. _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 209.\r\n\r\n     [1207] This or a third relic bore the name of Mamalhuaztli.\r\n     Sahagun also refers to a divine bow and arrow. _Hist. Conq._,\r\n     53-4. But his editions vary in text; see that of 1840,\r\n     210-12. The serpent was invoked even after the conquest,\r\n     says the pious friar, and he heard Father Tembleque relate\r\n     that he one day opened his window during a storm and had his\r\n     left eye injured by a ray of lightning, which damaged the\r\n     house and adjoining church. This ray, the Mexicans assured\r\n     him, was the Xiuhcoatl, conjured up by the sorcerers, for\r\n     they had seen it issue in the form of a big snake through\r\n     the door. The editor Bustamante tells an equally impressive\r\n     story in connection with an attempt to account for the\r\n     snake and lightning.\r\n\r\n     [1208] One being killed and two horses wounded. _Bernal\r\n     Diaz_, loc. cit.\r\n\r\n     [1209] _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 213. The editor\r\n     Bustamante speaks of a similar phenomenon in Michoacan in\r\n     1829. _Id._ (ed. 1829), 68.\r\n\r\n     [1210] ‘De los niños no quedó nadie, que las mismas madres\r\n     y padres los comian,’ is the statement of the native\r\n     records. _Id._, 210. Yet Torquemada, i. 572, assumes that\r\n     the Mexicans would not eat of their own race. Thousands had\r\n     already died of starvation without touching the flesh of\r\n     countrymen, though priests partook of children sacrificed\r\n     during ordinary festivals; but at last the scruple among\r\n     the masses was overcome by despair. See _Native Races_,\r\n     ii. passim.\r\n\r\n     [1211] ‘Porque no acabas cõ el que nos acabe?... Desseamos la\r\n     muerte por yr a descansar cõ Quetçalcouatlh,’ adds Gomara,\r\n     _Hist. Mex._, 210-11.\r\n\r\n     [1212] The chroniclers call him an uncle of the Tezcucan\r\n     king, but this appears to be a misinterpretation of Cortés’\r\n     text, wherein he says that such an uncle had captured the\r\n     prisoner.\r\n\r\n     [1213] _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 251. This was partly in accordance\r\n     with the law against nobles who returned from captivity,\r\n     as already instanced.\r\n\r\n     [1214] ‘Tenia mucho miedo de parecer ante mí, y tambien\r\n     estaba malo.’ _Cortés_, _Cartas_, 253. ‘Empacho,’ explains\r\n     Herrera, dec. iii. lib. ii. cap. vii. He feared to be shot.\r\n     _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 164.\r\n\r\n     [1215] ‘Ni tenian ni hallaban flechas ni varas ni piedras\r\n     con que nos ofender.... No tenian paso por donde andar sino\r\n     por encima de los muertos y por las azoteas.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 254.\r\n\r\n     [1216] ‘Mataron y prendieron mas de cuarenta mil ánimas.’\r\n     _Id._ Ixtlilxochitl, _Hor. Crueldades_, 48, raises the\r\n     number to 50,000, while Duran states that over 40,000 men\r\n     and women perished while fleeing. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii.\r\n     510. What pained the conquerors most, however, was the sight\r\n     and knowledge of what immense quantity of booty eluded them\r\n     to pass into the hands of these marauders.\r\n\r\n     [1217] ‘Entre la Garita del Peralvillo, la place de Santiago\r\n     de Tlatelolco et le pont d’Amaxac.’ So says Pichardo.\r\n     _Humboldt_, _Essai Pol._, i. 193. ‘Donde se embarcaban para\r\n     Atzlapotzalco,’ adds Bustamante. _Ixtlilxochitl_, _Hor.\r\n     Crueldades_, 50.\r\n\r\n     [1218] Chimalpain calls him Tlacotzin, afterward baptized\r\n     as Juan Velasquez. _Hist. Conq._, ii. 71. ‘Ciguacoacin, y\r\n     era el Capitan y gobernador de todos ellos, é por su consejo\r\n     se seguian todas las cosas de la guerra,’ says Cortés,\r\n     _Cartas_, 255.\r\n\r\n     [1219] ‘Porque les queria combatir y acabar de matar.’\r\n     _Cartas_, 256. ‘Pues eran barbaros, que no queria dexar\r\n     hombre vivo, q̄ se fuessen.’ _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. ii.\r\n     cap. vii.\r\n\r\n     [1220] The distinguished captive said: ‘Capitan señor,\r\n     dáte buena maña, que aquellos indios ... son esclavos de\r\n     Guatimuçin, é podrá ser quél va allí huyendo, porque su\r\n     bandera ya no paresçe.’ _Oviedo_, iii. 516. A canoe of twenty\r\n     rowers and bearing a number of people. _Gomara_, _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, 212. See also _Vetancvrt_, _Teatro Mex._, pt. iii.\r\n     164; _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii. 230. A small canoe,\r\n     says Duran.\r\n\r\n     [1221] Torquemada, i. 570-1, followed by Clavigero, mentions\r\n     besides Tetlepanquetzaltzin, king of Tlacopan, the fugitive\r\n     king of Tezcuco; but this is doubtful, as we have seen.\r\n     He enumerates several dignitaries. Brasseur de Bourbourg\r\n     names Tlacahuepan, son of Montezuma, while his authority,\r\n     Ixtlilxochitl, states that his namesake captured him\r\n     and Tetlepanquetzaltzin in another canoe, and in a third\r\n     Papantzin Oxomoc, widow of Emperor Cuitlahuatzin. _Hor.\r\n     Crueldades_, 50. ‘Quahutimoc se puso en pie en la popa de\r\n     su canoa para pelear. Mas como vio ballestas ... rindiose.’\r\n     _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._, 213. This probably assumed fact\r\n     has been elaborated by some writers into an heroic act.\r\n     The incident has been placed by tradition as occurring near\r\n     the later Puente del Clérigo. But this can hardly be. See\r\n     note 27. According to Bernal Diaz, Sandoval came up shortly\r\n     after, on learning the news, and demanded the surrender of\r\n     the captives to him as the commander of the fleet, who had\r\n     ordered Holguin to pursue the canoes. The latter refused,\r\n     and a delay occurred, during which another crew hurried to\r\n     bear the tidings to Cortés and claim the reward granted\r\n     for first reports. Two captains were now sent to summon\r\n     the disputants and captives. _Hist. Verdad._, 155. Cortés,\r\n     while according in his letter the credit of the capture to\r\n     Holguin, promised to refer the claim to the king. Holguin\r\n     figures some years later as regidor and estate owner in\r\n     the city.\r\n\r\n     [1222] ‘Esta casa era de un principal tlatilulcano que se\r\n     llamaba Aztaoatzin.’ _Sahagun_, _Hist. Conq._, 55.\r\n\r\n     [1223] The versions of this remarkable speech vary greatly.\r\n     ‘Habia hecho todo lo que de su parte era obligado para\r\n     defenderse á si y á los suyos hasta venir en aquel estado,\r\n     que ahora ficiese dél lo que yo quisiese.’ _Cortés_,\r\n     _Cartas_, 257. ‘Diçiéndole que le diesse de puñaladas é lo\r\n     matasse, porque no era raçon que viviesse en el mundo hombre\r\n     que avia perdido lo que’l avia perdido,’ adds Oviedo, iii.\r\n     422. ‘Preguntáronle por los chripstianos, é dixo: No me\r\n     preguntés esso; é si me quereys matar; matadme ya: que harto\r\n     estoy de vivir,’ says another version. _Id._, 517. ‘Iria mui\r\n     consolado adonde sus dioses estaban, especialmente haviendo\r\n     muerto à manos de tal Capitan.’ _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib.\r\n     ii. cap. vii. ‘Why so stubborn?’ is the way Duran opens the\r\n     conversation on Cortés’ part. _Hist. Ind._, MS., ii. 509.\r\n     ‘Toglietemi con questo pugnale una vita, che non perdei nella\r\n     difesa del mio Regno.’ _Clavigero_, _Storia Mess._, iii.\r\n     230. See also Ixtlilxochitl and others. Writers generally\r\n     go into ecstacy over this utterance. ‘Magnanimo,’ exclaims\r\n     Peter Martyr, dec. v. cap. viii. ‘Heroic,’ ejaculates\r\n     Bustamante in support of Chimalpain’s encomium. _Hist.\r\n     Conq._, ii. 75. ‘Ce trait est digne du plus beau temps de\r\n     la Grèce et de Rome.’ _Humboldt_, _Essai Pol._, i. 193.\r\n     ‘A spirit worthy of an ancient Roman,’ echoes Prescott,\r\n     _Mex._, iii. 206. Bernal Diaz says the emperor wept, and\r\n     with him his chiefs. _Hist. Verdad._, 155.\r\n\r\n     [1224] Made a few years later by order of the city council.\r\n     It was not, as many suppose, the original standard, for\r\n     this was hidden during two centuries among rubbish in the\r\n     university, as stated in its records. It now exists in the\r\n     museum, forming a piece about a yard square, which shows\r\n     on one side the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception with\r\n     hands joined in prayer, and bearing on her head a crown\r\n     of gold surrounded by a halo and a circle of stars; on\r\n     the other are the royal arms. _Boturini_, _Idea_, 157.\r\n     In his _Catálogo_, 75, this author assumes it to be the\r\n     standard given to the Tlascaltecs, but Carbajal states\r\n     that at Tlascala exists another standard of Cortés’, with\r\n     royal arms, _Hist. Mex._, ii. 637, with a picture of the\r\n     above named virgin. See also _Beaumont_, _Crón. Mich._, ii.\r\n     345-6. By order of July 31, 1528, the city council orders\r\n     bull-fights and other entertainments in honor of the day,\r\n     ‘e q todos cabalguen los q tovieren bestias.’ _Libro de\r\n     Cabildo_, MS., 127, 234. Mexicans are never seen to share\r\n     in the procession. ‘Tan profundo está en sus ánimos la\r\n     herida.’ _Cavo_, _Tres Siglos_, i. 3; _Humboldt_, _Essai\r\n     Pol._, i. 192. A minute account of the ceremonies on the\r\n     occasion is given in _Monumentos Hist. Admin. Colon._, MS.,\r\n     365, copied from the _Archivo General_.\r\n\r\n     [1225] Counting from May 30th, _Cartas_, 257, and so it is\r\n     stated in the grant to Cortés of Escudo de Armas. Duran\r\n     and Ixtlilxochitl extend it to 80 and Bernal Diaz to 93\r\n     days. ‘Despues de muchos combates, y mas de sessenta peleas\r\n     peligrosisimas.’ _Acosta_, _Hist. Nat. Ind._, 525.\r\n\r\n     [1226] Over 60 soldiers were lost in the great defeat, and\r\n     small numbers now and then, while the auxiliaries, less\r\n     skilled in fighting and chiefly unarmored, succumbed in\r\n     hordes. Gomara says about 50 soldiers, 6 horses, and not many\r\n     Indians; Herrera modifies to ‘a little over’ 50; Torquemada\r\n     advances to ‘less than 100,’ and Clavigero to ‘more than\r\n     100 Spaniards.’ Hernandez, in his _Estadist. Méj._, 232,\r\n     computes such curiously exact figures as 107 Spaniards,\r\n     18,915 Tlascaltecs, and 33,240 Aztecs. Ixtlilxochitl, ever\r\n     eager to enlarge upon the services of his race, claims\r\n     that 30,000 Tezcucans fell out of 200,000 employed, _Hor.\r\n     Crueldades_, 51; but this is evidently exaggerated.\r\n\r\n     [1227] ‘En que murieron infinitos.’ _Gomara_, _Hist. Mex._,\r\n     213; _Herrera_, dec. iii. lib. ii. cap. viii.; _Clavigero_,\r\n     _Storia Mess._, iii. 232-3. Bustamante raises the number\r\n     killed to ‘150,000 at least.’ _Chimalpain_, _Hist. Conq._,\r\n     ii. 74; Ixtlilxochitl, loc. cit., to 240,000, including most\r\n     of the nobles; while Torquemada, i. 577, observes ‘que de\r\n     veinte partes, no quedò vna, aviendo perecido, y muerto las\r\n     diez y nueve,’ he and several others allowing the estimate\r\n     of fully 300,000 inhabitants. The survivors are estimated\r\n     at from 30,000 persons, by Torquemada to 70,000 warriors\r\n     by Oviedo, iii. 516.\r\n\r\n     [1228] ‘Hiço herrar algunos Hombres, y Mugeres por Esclavos;\r\n     à todos los demàs dexò en libertad.’ _Torquemada_, 573. ‘À\r\n     muchos indios é indias, porque estaban dados por traydores,’\r\n     says Oviedo, iii. 517. Cortés stayed and punished those\r\n     who took slaves, ‘aunque todavia herraron en la cara á\r\n     algunos mancebos y mugeres.’ So states the native record of\r\n     Sahagun, _Hist. Conq._ (ed. 1840), 231. But if he punished\r\n     slave-takers it was for not declaring the capture to\r\n     the royal official. Duran reduces his account of Spanish\r\n     liberality to an absurdity, but more from politic reasons\r\n     than because he had not at hand better evidence, _Hist.\r\n     Ind._, MS., ii. 510.\r\n\r\n     [1229] _Hist. Verdad._, 156. ‘Io sospetto, che da’ Messicani\r\n     lasciati fossero a bella posta insepolti i cadaveri, per\r\n     iscacciar colla puzza gli Assediatori.’ _Clavigero_, _Storia\r\n     Mess._, iii. 231. But this is unlikely. A severe siege will\r\n     produce such results.\r\n\r\n     [1230] Bernal Diaz relates that although wine and provisions\r\n     from Cuba were abundantly dispensed at the banquet, yet\r\n     there was not room for one third of the soldiers, and much\r\n     discontent grew out of it, partly from the utterances of\r\n     drunken men. A dance followed. Father Olmedo complained of\r\n     so much revelry before the rendering of due thanks to God.\r\n     Cortés pleaded that soldiers must be allowed some license,\r\n     but the following day was set apart for religious services.\r\n     _Hist. Verdad._, 156.\r\n\r\n     [1231] Bustamante comments on the non-fulfilment of the\r\n     promises to Tlascala, saying that the republic was rightly\r\n     served for lending herself to the invaders. _Sahagun_,\r\n     _Hist. Conq._, 144. On their way home, says Ixtlilxochitl,\r\n     the Tlascaltecs and their neighbors plundered Tezcuco and\r\n     other towns. With the slaves carried home by his namesake,\r\n     he adds consolingly, the destroyed palaces of Tezcuco were\r\n     rebuilt. _Hor. Crueldades_, 52-3. The Tlascaltecs ‘aun\r\n     lleuaron hartas cargas de tasajos cecinados de Indios\r\n     Mexicanos, que repartieron entre sus parientes ... por\r\n     fiestas.’ _Bernal Diaz_, _Hist. Verdad._, 157.\r\n\r\n     [1232] ‘Non dubitamus quin justa sint bella ... in eos qui\r\n     humanam carnem epulantur,’ etc. _De Jure Belli_, lib. ii.\r\n     cap. xx.\r\n\r\n     [1233] Alvarado was Ajax; Maxixcatzin, Nestor; Quauhtemotzin,\r\n     Hector. _Chevalier_, _Mex. Ancien_, 232-41.",
