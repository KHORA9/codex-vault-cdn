In ecclesiastical history quite as much use can be made\r\nof the same aid in instruction. It is hoped that the present book may\r\nsupply a want increasingly felt by teachers employing modern methods in\r\nteaching ecclesiastical history. It has grown out of classroom work, and\r\nis addressed primarily to those who are teaching and studying the history\r\nof the Christian Church in universities and seminaries. But it is hoped\r\nthat it may serve the constantly increasing number interested in the early\r\nhistory of Christianity.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement of the selected illustrative material, a chronological\r\nanalysis and grouping of topics has been followed, according to the lines\r\nof treatment employed by K. Müller, F. Loofs, Von Schubert in his edition\r\nof Moeller’s text-book, and by Hergenröther to some extent. The whole\r\nhistory of ancient Christianity has accordingly been divided into\r\ncomparatively brief periods and subdivided into chapters and sections.\r\nThese divisions are connected and introduced by brief analyses and\r\ncharacterizations, with some indications of additional source material\r\navailable in English.\r\n\r\nA bibliography originally prepared for each chapter and section has been\r\nomitted. When the practical question arose of either reducing the amount\r\nof source material to admit a bibliography, or of making the book too\r\nexpensive for general use by students, the main purpose of the book\r\ndetermined the only way of avoiding two unsatisfactory solutions of the\r\nproblem, and the bibliography has been omitted. In this there may be less\r\nloss than at first appears. The student of ecclesiastical history is\r\nfortunately provided with ample bibliographical material for the ancient\r\nChurch in the universally available theological and other encyclopædias\r\nwhich have very recently appeared or are in course of publication, and in\r\nthe recent works on patristics. Possibly the time has come when, in place\r\nof duplicating bibliographies, reliance in such matters upon the work of\r\nothers may not be regarded as mortal sin against the ethics of\r\nscholarship. A list of works has been given in the General Bibliographical\r\nNote, which the student is expected to consult and to which the instructor\r\nshould encourage him to go for further information and bibliographical\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThe book presupposes the use of a text-book of Church history, such as\r\nthose by Cheetham, Kurtz, Moeller, Funk, or Duchesne, and a history of\r\ndoctrine, such as those of Seeberg, Bethune-Baker, Fisher, or Tixeront.\r\nReadings in more elaborate treatises, special monographs, and secular\r\nhistory may well be left to the direction of the instructor.\r\n\r\nThe translations, with a few exceptions which are noted, are referred for\r\nthe sake of convenience to the _Patrology_ of Migne or Mansi’s _Concilia_.\r\nAlthough use has been freely made of the aid offered by existing\r\ntranslations, especially those of the _Ante-Nicene_ and _Post-Nicene\r\nFathers_, yet all translations have been revised in accordance with the\r\nbest critical texts available. The aim in the revision has been accuracy\r\nand closeness to the original without too gross violation of the English\r\nidiom, and with exactness in the rendering of ecclesiastical and\r\ntheological technical terms. Originality is hardly to be expected in such\r\na work as this.\r\n\r\nAn author may not be conscious of any attempt to make his selection of\r\ntexts illustrate or support any particular phase of Christian belief or\r\necclesiastical polity, and his one aim may be to treat the matter\r\nobjectively and to render his book useful to all, yet he ought not to\r\nflatter himself that in either respect he has been entirely successful. In\r\necclesiastical history, no more than in any other branch of history, is it\r\npossible for an author who is really absorbed in his work to eliminate\r\ncompletely the personal equation. He should be glad to be informed of any\r\ninstance in which he may have unwittingly failed in impartiality, that\r\nwhen occasion presented he might correct it. The day has gone by in which\r\necclesiastical history can not be treated save as a branch of polemical\r\ntheology or as an apologetic for any particular phase of Christian belief\r\nor practice. It has at last become possible to teach the history of the\r\nChristian Church, for many centuries the greatest institution of Western\r\nEurope, in colleges and universities in conjunction with other historical\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\nThis volume has been prepared at the suggestion of the American Society of\r\nChurch History, and valuable suggestions have been gained from the\r\ndiscussions of that society. To Professor W. W. Rockwell, of Union\r\nTheological Seminary, New York, Professor F. A. Christie, of Meadville\r\nTheological School, the late Professor Samuel Macauley Jackson, of New\r\nYork, and Professor Ephraim Emerton, of Harvard University, I have also\r\nbeen indebted for advice. The first two named were members with me of a\r\ncommittee on a _Source-Book for Church History_ appointed several years\r\nago by the American Society of Church History.\r\n\r\nThat the book now presented to the public may be of service to the teacher\r\nand student of ecclesiastical history is my sincere wish. It may easily\r\nhappen that no one else would make just the same selection of sources here\r\nmade. But it is probable that the principal documents, those on which the\r\nmajority would agree and which are most needed by the teacher in his work,\r\nare included among those presented. There are, no doubt, slips and defects\r\nin a book written at intervals in a teacher’s work. With the kind\r\nco-operation of those who detect them, they may be corrected when an\r\nopportunity occurs.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH CULLEN AYER, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder each period special collections of available sources are to be\r\nfound.

D. 324\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the accession of Constantine to the sole sovereignty of the Roman\r\nEmpire, A. D. 324, ancient Christianity may be conveniently divided into\r\ntwo great periods. In the first, it was a religion liable to persecution,\r\nsuffering severely at times and always struggling to maintain itself; in\r\nthe second, it became the religion of the State, and in its turn set about\r\nto repress and persecute the heathen religions. It was no longer without\r\nlegal rights; it had the support of the secular rulers and was lavishly\r\nendowed with wealth. The conditions of the Church in these two periods are\r\nso markedly different, and the conditions had such a distinct effect upon\r\nthe life and growth of the Christian religion, that the reign of\r\nConstantine is universally recognized as marking a transition from one\r\nhistorical period to another, although no date which shall mark that\r\ntransition is universally accepted. The year 311, the year in which the\r\nDiocletian persecution ceased, has been accepted by many as the dividing\r\npoint. The exact date adopted is immaterial.\r\n\r\nThe principal sources in English for the history of the Christian Church\r\nbefore A. D. 324 are:\r\n\r\n_The Ante-Nicene Fathers. Translations of the Writings of the Fathers down\r\nto A. D. 325._ American edition, Buffalo and New York, 1885-1896; new\r\nedition, New York, 1896 (a reprint). The collection, cited as ANF,\r\ncontains the bulk of the Christian literature of the period, with the\r\nexception of the less important commentaries of Origen.\r\n\r\nEusebius, _Church History_. Translated with Prolegomena and Notes by\r\nArthur Cushman McGiffert. In _A Select Library of the Nicene and\r\nPost-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church_. Second series, New York,\r\n1890. The _Church History_ of Eusebius is the foundation of the study of\r\nthe history of the Church before A. D. 324, as it contains a vast number\r\nof citations from works now lost. The edition by Professor McGiffert is\r\nthe best in English, and is provided with scholarly notes, which serve as\r\nan elaborate commentary on the text. It should be in every library. This\r\nwork is cited as Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._ The text used in the extracts given\r\nin this source book is that of Ed. Schwartz, in _Die Griechischen\r\nChristlicher: Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte_. Kleine\r\nAusgabe, Leipsic, 1908. This text is identical with the larger and less\r\nconvenient edition by the same editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriod I. The Apostolic Age: To Circa A. D. 100\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period in the Church before the clash with Gnosticism and the rise of\r\nan apologetic literature comprises the apostolic and the post-apostolic\r\nages. These names have become traditional. The so-called apostolic age, or\r\nto circa 100, is that in which the Apostles lived, though the best\r\ntradition makes John the only surviving Apostle for the last quarter of a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe principal sources for the history of the Church in this period are the\r\nbooks of the New Testament, and only to a slight degree the works of\r\ncontemporaneous Jewish and heathen writers. It is hardly necessary to\r\nreproduce New Testament passages here. The Jewish references of importance\r\nwill be found in the works on the life of Christ and of St. Paul. As the\r\ntreatment of this period commonly falls under a different branch of study,\r\nNew Testament exegesis, it is not necessary in Church history to enter\r\ninto any detail. There are, however, a few references to events in this\r\nperiod which are to be found only outside the New Testament, and are of\r\nimportance to the student of Church history. These are the Neronian\r\npersecution (§ 1), the death of the Apostles (§§ 2, 3), and the\r\npersecution under Domitian (§ 4). The paucity of references to\r\nChristianity in the first century is due chiefly to the fact that\r\nChristianity appeared to the men of the times as merely a very small\r\nOriental religion, struggling for recognition, and contending with many\r\nothers coming from the same region. It had not yet made any great advance\r\neither in numbers or social importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. The Neronian Persecution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Neronian persecution took place A. D. 64. The occasion was the great\r\nfire which destroyed a large part of the city of Rome. To turn public\r\nsuspicion from himself as responsible for the fire, Nero attempted to make\r\nthe Christians appear as the incendiaries. Many were put to death in\r\nhorrible and fantastic ways. It was not, however, a persecution directed\r\nagainst Christianity as an unlawful religion. It was probably confined to\r\nRome and at most the immediate vicinity, and there is no evidence that it\r\nwas a general persecution.\r\n\r\nAdditional source material: Lactantius, _De Mortibus Persecutorum_, ch. 2\r\n(ANF, VII); Sulpicius Severus, Chronicon, II. 28 (PNF, ser. II, vol. XI).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Tacitus, _Annales_, XV, 44. Preuschen, _Analecta_, I, § 3:1. Mirbt,\r\nn. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tacitus (c. 52-c. 117), although not an eye-witness of the\r\n    persecution, had exceptionally good opportunities for obtaining\r\n    accurate information, and his account is entirely trustworthy. He\r\n    is the principal source for the persecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither by works of benevolence nor the gifts of the prince nor means of\r\nappeasing the gods did the shameful suspicion cease, so that it was not\r\nbelieved that the fire had been caused by his command. Therefore, to\r\novercome this rumor, Nero put in his own place as culprits, and punished\r\nwith most ingenious cruelty, men whom the common people hated for their\r\nshameful crimes and called Christians. Christ, from whom the name was\r\nderived, had been put to death in the reign of Tiberius by the procurator\r\nPontius Pilate. The deadly superstition, having been checked for a while,\r\nbegan to break out again, not only throughout Judea, where this mischief\r\nfirst arose, but also at Rome, where from all sides all things scandalous\r\nand shameful meet and become fashionable. Therefore, at the beginning,\r\nsome were seized who made confessions; then, on their information, a vast\r\nmultitude was convicted, not so much of arson as of hatred of the human\r\nrace. And they were not only put to death, but subjected to insults, in\r\nthat they were either dressed up in the skins of wild beasts and perished\r\nby the cruel mangling of dogs, or else put on crosses to be set on fire,\r\nand, as day declined, to be burned, being used as lights by night. Nero\r\nhad thrown open his gardens for that spectacle, and gave a circus play,\r\nmingling with the people dressed in a charioteer’s costume or driving in a\r\nchariot. From this arose, however, toward men who were, indeed, criminals\r\nand deserving extreme penalties, sympathy, on the ground that they were\r\ndestroyed not for the public good, but to satisfy the cruelty of an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Clement of Rome, _Ep. ad Corinthios_, I, 5, 6. Funk, _Patres\r\nApostolici_, 1901. (MSG, 1:218.) Preuschen, _Analecta_, I, § 3:5.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The work known as the First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians\r\n    was written in the name of the Roman Church about 100. The\r\n    occasion was the rise of contentions in the Corinthian Church. The\r\n    name of Clement does not appear in the body of the epistle, but\r\n    there is no good ground for questioning the traditional ascription\r\n    to Clement, since before the end of the second century it was\r\n    quoted under his name by several writers. This Clement was\r\n    probably the third or fourth bishop of Rome. The epistle was\r\n    written soon after the Domitian persecution (A. D. 95), and refers\r\n    not only to that but also to an earlier persecution, which was\r\n    very probably that under Nero. As the reference is only by way of\r\n    illustration, the author gives little detail. The passage\r\n    translated is of interest as containing the earliest reference to\r\n    the death of the Apostles Peter and Paul, and the language used\r\n    regarding Paul has been thought to imply that he labored in parts\r\n    beyond Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 5. But to leave the ancient examples, let us come to the champions who\r\nlived nearest our times; let us take the noble examples of our generation.\r\nOn account of jealousy and envy the greatest and most righteous pillars of\r\nthe Church were persecuted, and contended even unto death. Let us set\r\nbefore our eyes the good Apostles: Peter, who on account of unrighteous\r\njealousy endured not one nor two, but many sufferings, and so, having\r\nborne his testimony, went to his deserved place of glory. On account of\r\njealousy and strife Paul pointed out the prize of endurance. After he had\r\nbeen seven times in bonds, had been driven into exile, had been stoned,\r\nhad been a preacher in the East and in the West, he received the noble\r\nreward of his faith; having taught righteousness unto the whole world, and\r\nhaving come to the farthest bounds of the West, and having borne witness\r\nbefore rulers, he thus departed from the world and went unto the holy\r\nplace, having become a notable pattern of patient endurance.\r\n\r\nCh. 6. Unto these men who lived lives of holiness was gathered a vast\r\nmultitude of the elect, who by many indignities and tortures, being the\r\nvictims of jealousy, set the finest examples among us. On account of\r\njealousy women, when they had been persecuted as Danaïds and Dircæ, and\r\nhad suffered cruel and unholy insults, safely reached the goal in the race\r\nof faith and received a noble reward, feeble though they were in body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. The Death of Peter and Paul\r\n\r\n\r\n    Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, II, 25. (MSG, 20:207.) _Cf._ Mirbt, n. 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n    For an examination of the merits of Eusebius as a historian, see\r\n    McGiffert’s edition, PNF, ser. II, vol. I, pp. 45-52; also J. B.\r\n    Lightfoot, art. “Eusebius (23) of Caesarea,” in DCB.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The works of Caius have been preserved only in fragments; see\r\n    Krüger, § 90. If he was a contemporary of Zephyrinus, he probably\r\n    lived during the pontificate of that bishop of Rome, 199-217 A. D.\r\n    The Phrygian heresy which Caius combated was Montanism; see below,\r\n    § 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, was a contemporary of Soter, Bishop\r\n    of Rome, 166-174 A. D., whom he mentions in an epistle to the\r\n    Roman Church. Of his epistles only fragments have been preserved;\r\n    see Krüger, § 55. The following extract from his epistle to the\r\n    Roman Church is the earliest explicit statement that Peter and\r\n    Paul suffered martyrdom at the same time or that Peter was ever in\r\n    Italy. In connection with this extract, that from Clement of Rome\r\n    (see § 1, _a_) should be consulted; also Lactantius, _De Mortibus\r\n    Persecutorum_, ch. 2 (ANF).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is therefore recorded that Paul was beheaded at Rome itself, and that\r\nPeter was crucified likewise at the same time. This account of Peter and\r\nPaul is confirmed by the fact that their names are preserved in the\r\ncemeteries of that place even to the present time. It is confirmed no less\r\nby a member of the Church, Caius by name, a contemporary of Zephyrinus,\r\nBishop of Rome. In carrying on a discussion in writing with Proclus, the\r\nleader of the Phrygian heresy, he says as follows concerning the places\r\nwhere the sacred corpses of the aforesaid Apostles are laid: “But I am\r\nable to show the trophies of the Apostles. For if you will go to the\r\nVatican or to the Ostian Way, you will find the trophies of those who laid\r\nthe foundations of this church.” And that they two suffered martyrdom at\r\nthe same time is stated by Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, corresponding\r\nwith the Romans in writing, in the following words: “You have thus by such\r\nadmonition bound together the planting of Peter and Paul at Rome and at\r\nCorinth. For both planted in our Corinth and likewise taught us, and in\r\nlike manner in Italy they both taught and suffered martyrdom at the same\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. The Death of the Apostle John\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Irenæus, _Adversus Hæreses_, II, 22, 5; III, 3, 4. (MSG, 7:785,\r\n854.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Irenæus was bishop of Lyons soon after 177. He was born in Asia\r\n    Minor about 120, and was a disciple of Polycarp (ob. circa 155)\r\n    and of other elders who had seen John, the disciple of the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\nII, 22, 5. Those in Asia associated with John, the disciple of the Lord,\r\ntestify that John delivered it [a tradition regarding the length of\r\nChrist’s ministry] to them. For he remained among them until the time of\r\nTrajan [98-117 A. D.].\r\n\r\nIII, 3, 4. But the church in Ephesus also, which was founded by Paul, and\r\nwhere John remained until the time of Trajan, is a faithful witness of the\r\napostolic tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Jerome, _Comm. ad Galat._ (MSL, 26:462.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following extract from Jerome’s commentary on Galatians is of\r\n    such late date as to be of doubtful value as an authority. There\r\n    is, however, nothing improbable in it, and it is in harmony with\r\n    other traditions. It is to be taken as a tradition which at any\r\n    rate represents the opinion of the fourth century regarding the\r\n    Apostle John. _Cf._ Jerome, _De Viris Inlustribus_, ch. 9 (PNF,\r\n    ser. II, vol. III, 364).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the holy Evangelist John had lived to extreme old age in Ephesus, he\r\ncould be carried only with difficulty by the hands of the disciples, and\r\nas he was not able to pronounce more words, he was accustomed to say at\r\nevery assembly, “Little children, love one another.” At length the\r\ndisciples and brethren who were present became tired of hearing always the\r\nsame thing and said: “Master, why do you always say this?” Thereupon John\r\ngave an answer worthy of himself: “Because this is the commandment of the\r\nLord, and if it is observed then is it enough.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, III, 31. (MSG, 20:279.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Polycrates was bishop of Ephesus and a contemporary of Victor of\r\n    Rome (189-199 A. D.). His date cannot be fixed more precisely. The\r\n    reference to the “high priest’s mitre” is obscure; see J. B.\r\n    Lightfoot, _Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians_, p. 345. A\r\n    longer extract from this epistle of Polycrates will be found under\r\n    the Easter Controversy (§ 38).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time of John’s death has been given in a general way,(1) but his\r\nburial-place is indicated by an epistle of Polycrates (who was bishop of\r\nthe parish of Ephesus) addressed to Victor of Rome, mentioning him,\r\ntogether with the Apostle Philip and his daughters, in the following\r\nwords: “For in Asia also great lights have fallen asleep, which shall rise\r\nagain at the last day, at the coming of the Lord, when he shall come with\r\nglory from heaven and seek out all the saints. Among these are Philip, one\r\nof the twelve Apostles, who sleeps at Hierapolis, and his two aged virgin\r\ndaughters, and another daughter who lived in the Holy Spirit and now rests\r\nat Ephesus; and moreover John, who was both a witness and a teacher, who\r\nreclined upon the bosom of the Lord, and being a priest wore the high\r\npriest’s mitre, also sleeps at Ephesus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. The Persecution under Domitian\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is commonly called the persecution under Domitian (81-96) does not\r\nseem to have been a persecution of Christianity as such. The charges of\r\natheism and superstition may have been due to heathen misunderstanding of\r\nthe Christian faith and worship. There is no sufficient ground for\r\nidentifying Flavius Clemens with the Clemens who was bishop of Rome. For\r\nbibliography of the persecution under Domitian, see Preuschen, _Analecta_,\r\nsecond ed., I, 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Cassius Dio (excerpt. per Xiphilinum), _Hist. Rom._, LXVII, 14 _f._\r\nPreuschen, _Analecta_, I, § 4:11.\r\n\r\n\r\n    For Cassius Dio, see _Encyc. Brit._, art. “Dio Cassius.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time (95) the road which leads from Sinuessa to Puteoli was paved.\r\nAnd in the same year Domitian caused Flavius Clemens along with many\r\nothers to be put to death, although he was his cousin and had for his wife\r\nFlavia Domitilla, who was also related to him. The charge of atheism was\r\nmade against both of them, in consequence of which many others also who\r\nhad adopted the customs of the Jews were condemned. Some were put to\r\ndeath, others lost their property. Domitilla, however, was only banished\r\nto Pandataria.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, III, 18. (MSG, 20:252.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo such a degree did the teaching of our faith flourish at that time(2)\r\nthat even those writers who were far from our religion did not hesitate to\r\nmention in their histories the persecutions and martyrdoms which took\r\nplace during that time. And they, indeed, accurately indicate the time.\r\nFor they record that, in the fifteenth year of Domitian, Flavia Domitilla,\r\ndaughter of a sister of Flavius Clemens, who was at that time one of the\r\nconsuls of Rome, was exiled with many others to the island of Pontia(3) in\r\nconsequence of testimony borne to Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriod II. The Post-Apostolic Age: A. D. 100-A. D. 140\r\n\r\n\r\nThe post-apostolic age, extending from circa 100 to circa 140, is the age\r\nof the beginnings of Gentile Christianity on an extended scale. It is\r\nmarked by the rapid spread of Christianity, so that immediately after its\r\nclose the Church is found throughout the Roman world, and the Roman\r\nGovernment is forced to take notice of it and deal with it as a religion\r\n(§§ 6, 7); the decline of the Jewish element in the Church and extreme\r\nhostility of Judaism to the Church (§ 5); the continuance of chiliastic\r\nexpectations (§ 10); the beginnings of the passion for martyrdom (§ 8); as\r\nwell as the appearance of the forms of organization and worship which\r\nsubsequently became greatly elaborated and remained permanently in the\r\nChurch (§§ 12-15); as also the appearance of religious and moral ideas\r\nwhich became dominant in the ancient Church (§§ 11, 12, 16). The\r\nliterature of the period upon which the study of the conditions and\r\nthought of the Church of this age must be based is represented principally\r\nby the so-called Apostolic Fathers, a name which is convenient, but\r\nmisleading and to be regretted. These are Clement of Rome, Barnabas,\r\nIgnatius, Polycarp, Papias, Hermas; with the writings of these are\r\ncommonly included two anonymous books known as the _Didache_, or _Teaching\r\nof the Twelve Apostles_, and the _Epistle to Diognetus_. From all of these\r\nselections are given.(4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. Christianity and Judaism\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Christian Church grew up not on Jewish but on Gentile soil. In a very\r\nshort time the Gentiles formed the overwhelming majority within the\r\nChurch. As they did not become Jews and did not observe the Jewish\r\nceremonial law, a problem arose as to the place of the Jewish law, which\r\nwas accepted without question as of divine authority. One solution is\r\ngiven by the author of the so-called Epistle of Barnabas, which should be\r\ncompared with the solution given by St. Paul in his epistles to the\r\nGalatians and to the Romans. The number of conversions from Judaism\r\nrapidly declined, and very early an extreme hostility toward Christianity\r\nbecame common among the Jews.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Barnabas, _Epistula_, 4, 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The epistle attributed to Barnabas is certainly not by the Apostle\r\n    of that name. Its date is much disputed, but may be safely placed\r\n    within the first century. The author attempts to show the contrast\r\n    between Judaism and Christianity by proving that the Jews wholly\r\n    misunderstood the Mosaic law and had long since lost any claims\r\n    supposed to be derived from the Mosaic covenant. The epistle is\r\n    everywhere marked by hostility to Judaism, of which the writer has\r\n    but imperfect knowledge. The book was regarded as Holy Scripture\r\n    by Clement of Alexandria and by Origen, though with some\r\n    hesitation. The position taken by the author was undoubtedly\r\n    extreme, and not followed generally by the Church. It was,\r\n    however, merely pushing to excess a conviction already prevalent\r\n    in the Church, that Christianity and Judaism were distinct\r\n    religions. For a saner and more commonly accepted position, see\r\n    Justin Martyr, _Apol._, I, 47-53 (ANF, I, 178 _ff._). A\r\n    translation of the entire epistle may be found in ANF, I, 137-149.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 4. It is necessary, therefore, for us who inquire much concerning\r\npresent events to seek out those things which are able to save us. Let us\r\nwholly flee, then, from all the works of iniquity, lest the works of\r\niniquity take hold of us; and let us hate the error of the present times,\r\nthat we may set our love on the future. Let us not give indulgence to our\r\nsoul, that it should have power to run with sinners and the wicked, that\r\nwe become not like them. The final occasion of stumbling approaches,\r\nconcerning which it is written as Enoch speaks: For this end the Lord has\r\ncut short the times and the days, that His beloved may hasten and will\r\ncome to his inheritance.… (5) Ye ought therefore to understand. And this\r\nalso I beg of you, as being one of you and with special love loving you\r\nall more than my own soul, to take heed to yourselves, and not be like\r\nsome, adding largely to your sins, and saying: “The covenant is both\r\ntheirs and ours.” For it is ours; but they thus finally lost it, after\r\nMoses had already received it.(6)\r\n\r\nCh. 9. … But also circumcision, in which they trusted, has been abrogated.\r\nHe declared that circumcision was not of the flesh; but they transgressed\r\nbecause an evil angel deluded them.(7)… Learn, then, my beloved children,\r\nconcerning all things richly, that Abraham, the first who enjoined\r\ncircumcision, looking forward in spirit to Jesus, circumcised, the\r\nteaching of the three letters having been received. For the Scripture\r\nsaith: “Abraham circumcised eighteen and three hundred men of his\r\nhousehold.” What, then, was the knowledge [_gnosis_] given to him in this?\r\nLearn that he says the eighteen first and then, making a space, the three\r\nhundred. The eighteen are the Iota, ten, and the Eta, eight; and you have\r\nhere the name of Jesus. And because the cross was to express the grace in\r\nthe letter Tau, he says also, three hundred. He discloses therefore Jesus\r\nin the two letters, and the cross in one. He knows this who has put within\r\nus the engrafted gift of his teaching. No one has learned from me a more\r\nexcellent piece of knowledge, but I know that ye are worthy.(8)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Justin Martyr, _Dialogus cum Tryphone_, 17. J. C. T. Otto, Corpus\r\n_Apologetarum Christianorum Sæculi Secundi_, third ed.; 1876-81. (MSG,\r\n6:511.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Justin Martyr was born about 100 in Samaria. He was one of the\r\n    first of the Gentiles who had been trained in philosophy to become\r\n    a Christian. His influence upon the doctrinal development of the\r\n    Church was profound. He died as a martyr between 163 and 168. His\r\n    principal works are the two Apologies written in close connection\r\n    under Antoninus Pius (138-161), probably about 150, and his\r\n    dialogue with Trypho the Jew, which was written after the first\r\n    Apology. All translations of Justin Martyr are based upon Otto’s\r\n    text, _v. supra_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the other nations have not been so guilty of wrong inflicted on us and\r\non Christ as you have been, who are in fact the authors of the wicked\r\nprejudices against the Just One and against us who hold by Him.(9) For\r\nafter you had crucified Him, the only blameless and righteous Man, through\r\nwhose stripes there is healing to those who through Him approach the\r\nFather, when you knew that He had risen from the dead and ascended into\r\nheaven, as the prophecies foretold would take place, not only did you not\r\nrepent of those things wherein you had done wickedly, but you then\r\nselected and sent out from Jerusalem chosen men through all the world to\r\nsay that the atheistical heresy of the Christians had appeared and to\r\nspread abroad those things which all they who know us not speak against\r\nus; so that you are the cause of unrighteousness not only in your own\r\ncase, but, in fact, in the case of all other men generally.… Accordingly,\r\nyou show great zeal in publishing throughout all the world bitter, dark,\r\nand unjust slanders against the only blameless and righteous Light sent\r\nfrom God to men.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Martyrdom of Polycarp_, 12, 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, died at Smyrna February 2, 155, at the\r\n    age of at least eighty-six, but he was probably nearer one hundred\r\n    years old. He was the disciple of John, probably same as the\r\n    Apostle John. His epistle was written circa 115, soon after the\r\n    death of Ignatius of Antioch. At present it is generally regarded\r\n    as genuine, though grave doubts have been entertained in the past.\r\n    The martyrdom was written by some member of the church at Smyrna\r\n    for that body to send to the church at Philomelium in Phrygia, and\r\n    must have been composed soon after the death of the aged bishop.\r\n    It is probably the finest of all the ancient martyrdoms and should\r\n    be read in its entirety. Translation in the ANF, I, 37-45.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 12. The whole multitude both of the heathen and the Jews who dwelt at\r\nSmyrna cried out with uncontrollable fury and in loud voice: “This is the\r\nteacher of Asia, the father of the Christians and the overthrower of our\r\ngods, who teaches many neither to sacrifice nor to worship.” Saying these\r\nthings, they cried out and demanded of Philip, the Asiarch, to let a lion\r\nloose upon Polycarp. But he said he could not do this, since the sports\r\nwith beasts had ended. Then it pleased them to cry out with one consent\r\nthat he should burn Polycarp alive.…\r\n\r\nCh. 13. These things were carried into effect more rapidly than they were\r\nspoken, and the multitude immediately gathered together wood and fagots\r\nout of the shops and baths, and the Jews especially, as was their custom,\r\nassisted them eagerly in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. The Extension of Christianity\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine with accuracy even the principal places to\r\nwhich Christianity had spread in the first half of the second century.\r\nAncient writers were not infrequently led astray by their own rhetoric in\r\ndealing with this topic.\r\n\r\n\r\nJustin Martyr, _Dialogus cum Tryphone_, 117. (MSG, 6:676.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following passage is of significance as bearing not only upon\r\n    the extent to which Christianity had spread, after making due\r\n    allowance for rhetoric, but also upon the conception of the\r\n    eucharist and its relation to the ancient sacrifices held, by some\r\n    Christians at least, in the first half of the second century.\r\n    _Cf._ ch. 41 of the same work, _v. infra_, §§ 12 _f._\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, as to all sacrifices offered in His name, which Jesus Christ\r\ncommanded to be offered, _i.e._, in the eucharist of the bread and cup,\r\nand which are offered by Christians in all places throughout the world,\r\nGod, anticipating them, testified that they are well-pleasing to Him; but\r\nHe rejects those presented by you and by those priests of yours, saying:\r\nAnd your sacrifices I will not accept at your hands; for from the rising\r\nof the sun unto the going down of the same my name is great among the\r\nGentiles (He says), but ye have profaned it.(10) But since you deceive\r\nyourselves, both you and your teachers, when you interpret what was said\r\nas if the Word spoke of those of your nation who were in the dispersion,\r\nand that it said that their prayers and sacrifices offered in every place\r\nare pure and well-pleasing, you should know that you are speaking falsely\r\nand are trying to cheat yourselves in every way; for, in the first place,\r\nnot even yet does your nation extend from the rising to the setting sun,\r\nfor there are nations among which none of your race ever dwelt. For there\r\nis not a single race of men, whether among barbarians or Greeks, or by\r\nwhatever name they may be called, of those who live in wagons or are\r\ncalled nomads or of herdsmen living in tents, among whom prayers and\r\nthanksgivings are not offered through the name of the crucified Jesus to\r\nthe Father and Maker of all things. For, furthermore, at that time, when\r\nthe prophet Malachi said this, your dispersion over the whole earth, as\r\nyou are now, had not taken place, as is evident from the Scriptures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. Relation of the Roman State to Christianity\r\n\r\n\r\nThe procedure of the Roman Government against the Christians first took a\r\ndefinite form with the rescript of Trajan addressed to Pliny circa A. D.\r\n111-113, but there is no formal imperial edict extant before Decius on the\r\nquestion of the Christian religion. In an addition to the rescript of\r\nTrajan addressed to Pliny there is a letter of Hadrian on the Christians\r\n(_Ep. ad Servianum_) which is of interest as giving the opinion of that\r\nEmperor, but the rescript addressed to Minucius Fundanus is probably\r\nspurious, as is also the Epistle of Antoninus Pius to the Common Assembly\r\nof Asia.\r\n\r\nAdditional source material: The text of the rescripts may be found in\r\nPreuschen, _Analecta_, I, §§ 6, 7; translations, ANF, I, 186 _f._, and\r\nEusebius, _Hist. Ec._ (ed. McGiffert), IV, 9, and IV, 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlinius Junior, _Epistulæ_, X, 96, 97. Preuschen, _Analecta_, I, 12 _ff._\r\n_Cf._ Mirbt, nn. 14. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Caius Cæcilius Secundus is commonly known as Pliny the Younger, to\r\n    distinguish him from his uncle, Pliny the Naturalist, whose wealth\r\n    he inherited and whose name he seems to have borne. He was\r\n    proprætor of Bithynia under Trajan (98-117), with whom he stood on\r\n    terms of friendship and even intimacy. His letter to the Emperor\r\n    requesting advice as to the right mode of dealing with Christians\r\n    was written between 111 and 113.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This correspondence is of the first importance, as it is\r\n    unimpeachable evidence as to the spread of Christianity in the\r\n    province in which Pliny was placed, to the customs of the\r\n    Christians in their worship, and to the method of dealing with the\r\n    new religion, which was followed for a long time with little\r\n    change. It established the policy that Christianity, as such, was\r\n    not to be punished as a crime, that the State did not feel called\r\n    upon to seek out Christians, that it would not act upon anonymous\r\n    accusations, but that when proper accusations were brought, the\r\n    general laws, which Christians had violated on account of their\r\n    faith, should be executed. Christianity was not to be treated as a\r\n    crime. The mere renunciation of Christianity, coupled with the\r\n    proof of renunciation involved in offering sacrifice, enabled the\r\n    accused to escape punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEp. 96. It is my custom, my lord, to refer to you all questions about\r\nwhich I have doubts. Who, indeed, can better direct me in hesitation, or\r\nenlighten me in ignorance? In the examination of Christians I have never\r\ntaken part; therefore I do not know what crime is usually punished or\r\ninvestigated or to what extent. So I have no little uncertainty whether\r\nthere is any distinction of age, or whether the weaker offenders fare in\r\nno respect otherwise than the stronger; whether pardon is granted on\r\nrepentance, or whether when one has been a Christian there is no gain to\r\nhim in that he has ceased to be such; whether the mere name, if it is\r\nwithout crimes, or crimes connected with the name are punished. Meanwhile\r\nI have taken this course with those who were accused before me as\r\nChristians: I have asked them whether they were Christians. Those who\r\nconfessed I asked a second and a third time, threatening punishment. Those\r\nwho persisted I ordered led away to execution. For I did not doubt that,\r\nwhatever it was they admitted, obstinacy and unbending perversity\r\ncertainly deserve to be punished. There were others of the like insanity,\r\nbut because they were Roman citizens I noted them down to be sent to Rome.\r\nSoon after this, as it often happens, because the matter was taken notice\r\nof, the crime became wide-spread and many cases arose. An unsigned paper\r\nwas presented containing the names of many. But these denied that they\r\nwere or had been Christians, and I thought it right to let them go, since\r\nat my dictation they prayed to the gods and made supplication with incense\r\nand wine to your statue, which I had ordered to be brought into the court\r\nfor the purpose, together with the images of the gods, and in addition to\r\nthis they cursed Christ, none of which things, it is said, those who are\r\nreally Christians can be made to do. Others who were named by an informer\r\nsaid that they were Christians, and soon afterward denied it, saying,\r\nindeed, that they had been, but had ceased to be Christians, some three\r\nyears ago, some many years, and one even twenty years ago. All these also\r\nnot only worshipped your statue and the images of the gods, but also\r\ncursed Christ. They asserted, however, that the amount of their fault or\r\nerror was this: that they had been accustomed to assemble on a fixed day\r\nbefore daylight and sing by turns [_i.e._, antiphonally] a hymn to Christ\r\nas a god; and that they bound themselves with an oath, not for any crime,\r\nbut to commit neither theft, nor robbery, nor adultery, not to break their\r\nword and not to deny a deposit when demanded; after these things were\r\ndone, it was their custom to depart and meet together again to take food,\r\nbut ordinary and harmless food; and they said that even this had ceased\r\nafter my edict was issued, by which, according to your commands, I had\r\nforbidden the existence of clubs. On this account I believed it the more\r\nnecessary to find out from two maid-servants, who were called deaconesses\r\n[_ministræ_], and that by torture, what was the truth. I found nothing\r\nelse than a perverse and excessive superstition. I therefore adjourned the\r\nexamination and hastened to consult you. The matter seemed to me to be\r\nworth deliberation, especially on account of the number of those in\r\ndanger. For many of every age, every rank, and even of both sexes, are\r\nbrought into danger; and will be in the future. The contagion of that\r\nsuperstition has penetrated not only the cities but also the villages and\r\ncountry places; and yet it seems possible to stop it and set it right. At\r\nany rate, it is certain enough that the temples, deserted until quite\r\nrecently, begin to be frequented, that the ceremonies of religion, long\r\ndisused, are restored, and that fodder for the victims comes to market,\r\nwhereas buyers of it were until now very few. From this it may easily be\r\nsupposed what a multitude of men can be reclaimed if there be a place of\r\nrepentance.\r\n\r\nEp. 97 (_Trajan to Pliny_). You have followed, my dear Secundus, the\r\nproper course of procedure in examining the cases of those who were\r\naccused to you as Christians. For, indeed, nothing can be laid down as a\r\ngeneral law which contains anything like a definite rule of action. They\r\nare not to be sought out. If they are accused and convicted, they are to\r\nbe punished, yet on this condition, that he who denies that he is a\r\nChristian and makes the fact evident by an act, that is, by worshipping\r\nour gods, shall obtain pardon on his repentance, however much suspected as\r\nto the past. Papers, however, which are presented anonymously ought not to\r\nbe admitted in any accusation. For they are a very bad example and\r\nunworthy of our times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. Martyrdom and the Desire for Martyrdom\r\n\r\n\r\nIgnatius of Antioch, _Ep. ad Romanos_, 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ignatius was bishop of Antioch in the opening years of the second\r\n    century. According to tradition, he suffered martyrdom in Rome\r\n    under Trajan, circa 117. Having been sent from Antioch to Rome by\r\n    command of the Emperor, on his way he addressed letters to various\r\n    churches in Asia, exhorting them to seek unity and avoid heresy by\r\n    close union with the local bishop. His aim seems to have been\r\n    practical, to promote the welfare of the Christian communities\r\n    rather than the exaltation of the episcopal office itself. Doubts\r\n    have arisen as to the authenticity of these epistles on account of\r\n    the frequent references to the episcopate and to heresy. Further\r\n    difficulty has been caused by the fact that the epistles of\r\n    Ignatius appear in three forms or recensions, a longer Greek\r\n    recension forming a group of thirteen epistles, a short Greek of\r\n    seven epistles, and a still shorter Syriac version of only three.\r\n    After much fluctuation of opinion, due to the general\r\n    reconstruction of the history of the whole period, which has gone\r\n    through various marked changes, the opinion of scholars has been\r\n    steadily settling upon the short Greek recension of seven epistles\r\n    as authentic, especially since the critical re-examination of the\r\n    whole question by Zahn and Lightfoot.\r\n\r\n\r\nI write to all the churches and impress on all, that I shall willingly die\r\nfor God unless ye hinder me. I beseech you not to show unseasonable\r\ngood-will toward me.(11) Permit me to be the food of wild beasts, through\r\nwhom it will be granted me to attain unto God. I am the wheat of God and I\r\nam ground by the teeth of wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread\r\nof Christ. Rather entice the wild beasts, that they may become my tomb and\r\nleave nothing of my body, so that when I have fallen asleep I may be\r\nburdensome to no one. Then I shall be truly a disciple of Jesus Christ,\r\nwhen the world sees not my body. Entreat Christ for me, that by these\r\ninstruments I may be found a sacrifice to God. Not as Peter and Paul(12)\r\ndo I issue commandments unto you. They were Apostles, I a condemned man;\r\nthey were free, I even until now a slave.(13) But if I suffer, I shall be\r\nthe freedman of Jesus Christ, and shall rise again free in Him. And now,\r\nbeing in bonds, I learn not to desire anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. The Position of the Roman Community of Christians in the Church\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church took very early a leading place in the Christian Church,\r\neven before the rise of the Petrine tradition, and its importance was\r\ngenerally recognized. Its charity was very widely known and extolled. It\r\nwas a part of its care for Christians everywhere, a care which found\r\nexpression later in the obligation of maintaining the faith in the great\r\ntheological controversies. On the position of the Roman Church in this\r\nperiod, see the address of the Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans (ANF, I,\r\n73), as also the relation of Polycarp to the Roman Church in connection\r\nwith the question of the date of Easter (see § 38, below).\r\n\r\n\r\nDionysius of Corinth, “Epistle to the Roman Church,” in Eusebius, _Hist.\r\nEc._, IV, 23. (MSG, 20:388.) For text, see Kirch, n. 49 _f._\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is still current an Epistle of Dionysius to the Romans,\r\naddressed to Soter, bishop at that time. But there is nothing like quoting\r\nits words in which, in approval of the custom of the Romans maintained\r\nuntil the persecution in our own time, he writes as follows: “For you have\r\nfrom the beginning this custom of doing good in different ways to all the\r\nbrethren, and of sending supplies to many churches in all the cities, in\r\nthis way refreshing the poverty of those in need, and helping brethren in\r\nthe mines with the supplies which you have sent from the beginning,\r\nmaintaining as Romans the customs of the Romans handed down from the\r\nfathers, which your blessed bishop Soter has not only kept up, but also\r\nincreased, helping the saints with the abundant supply he sends from time\r\nto time, and with blessed words exhorting, as a loving father his\r\nchildren, the brethren who come up to the city.” In this same epistle he\r\nalso mentions the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians, showing that from\r\nthe first it was read by ancient custom before the Church. He says,\r\ntherefore: “To-day, then, being the Lord’s day we kept holy; in which we\r\nread your letter; for reading it we shall always have admonition, as also\r\nfrom the former one written to us through Clement.” Moreover, the same\r\nwriter speaks of his own epistles as having been falsified, as follows:\r\n“For when the brethren asked me to write letters, I wrote them. And these\r\nthe apostles of the devil have filled with tares, taking away some things\r\nand adding others. For them there is woe in store. So it is not marvellous\r\nthat some have tried to falsify even the dominical scriptures [_i.e._, the\r\nHoly Scriptures], when they have conspired against writings of another\r\nsort.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. Chiliastic Expectations\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimitive Christianity was marked by great chiliastic enthusiasm, traces\r\nof which may be found in the New Testament. By chiliasm, strictly\r\nspeaking, is meant the belief that Christ was to return to earth and reign\r\nvisibly for one thousand years. That return was commonly placed in the\r\nimmediate future. With that reign was connected the bodily resurrection of\r\nthe saints. This belief, in somewhat varying form, was one of the great\r\nethical motives in apostolic and post-apostolic times. It was a part of\r\nthe fundamental principles of Montanism. It disappeared with the rise of a\r\n“scientific theology” such as that of Alexandria, the exclusion of\r\nMontanism, and the changed conception of the relation of the Church and\r\nthe world, due to the lapse of time and the establishment of Christianity\r\nas the religion of the State. From the fourth century it ceased to be a\r\nliving doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Papias, in Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, III, 39. (MSG, 20: 300.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Papias, from whom two selections have been taken, was bishop of\r\n    Hierapolis in Phrygia during the first part of the second century.\r\n    He was, therefore, an elder contemporary of Justin Martyr. His\r\n    work, _The Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord_, has perished,\r\n    with the exception of a few fragments. The comments of Eusebius in\r\n    introducing the quotations of Papias are characteristic of the\r\n    change that had come over the Church since the post-apostolic\r\n    period. That Papias was not to be regarded as a man of small power\r\n    simply because he held chiliastic ideas is sufficiently refuted by\r\n    the fact that Justin Martyr falls but little behind Papias in\r\n    extravagance of expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I shall not hesitate, also, to set in order for you with my\r\ninterpretations whatsoever things I have ever learned carefully from the\r\nelders and carefully remembered, guaranteeing the truth of them.… For I\r\ndid not think that what was to be gotten from the books would profit me as\r\nmuch as what came from the living and abiding voice.…” The same writer\r\ngives also other accounts which he says came to him through unwritten\r\ntraditions, certain strange parables and teachings of the Saviour and some\r\nother more mythical things. Among these he says that there will be a\r\nperiod of some thousand years after the resurrection of the dead, when the\r\nkingdom of Christ will be set up in a material form on this very earth. I\r\nsuppose he got these ideas through a misunderstanding of the apostolic\r\naccounts, not perceiving that the things said by them were spoken\r\nmystically in figures. For he appears to have been of very limited\r\nunderstanding, as one can see from his discourses, though so many of the\r\nChurch Fathers after him adopted a like opinion, urging in their support\r\nthe antiquity of the man; as, for instance, Irenæus and any one else that\r\nmay have proclaimed similar views.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Irenæus. _Adv. Hæreses_, V, 33. (MSG, 7:1213.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elders who saw John, the disciple of the Lord, relate that they heard\r\nfrom him how the Lord used to teach in regard to those times, and say:\r\n“The days will come in which vines shall grow, each having ten thousand\r\nbranches, and in each branch ten thousand twigs, and in each twig ten\r\nthousand shoots, and in each one of the shoots ten thousand clusters, and\r\non every cluster ten thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed will\r\nyield five-and-twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the saints\r\nshall lay hold of a cluster, another shall cry out, ‘I am better cluster,\r\ntake me; bless the Lord through me.’ In like manner [the Lord declared]\r\nthat a grain of wheat would produce ten thousand ears, and that every ear\r\nwould produce ten thousand grains, and every grain would yield ten pounds\r\nof clear, pure, fine flour; and that all other fruit-bearing trees, and\r\nseeds and grass would produce similar proportions, and that all animals\r\nfeeding [only] on the productions of the earth would [in those days]\r\nbecome peaceful and harmonious with each other and be in perfect\r\nsubjection to men.” And these things are borne witness to in writing by\r\nPapias, the hearer of John, and a companion of Polycarp, in his fourth\r\nbook; for there were five books compiled by him. And he says in addition:\r\n“Now these things are credible to believers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Justin Martyr, _Dialogus cum Tryphone_, 80 _f._ (MSG, 6:665.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 80. Although you have fallen in with some who are called Christians,\r\nbut who do not admit this truth [the resurrection] and venture to\r\nblaspheme the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of\r\nJacob,(14) and who say that there is no resurrection of the dead and that\r\ntheir souls, when they die, are taken to heaven, be careful not to regard\r\nthem as Christians.… But I and whoever are on all points right-minded\r\nChristians know that there will be a resurrection of the dead and a\r\nthousand years in Jerusalem, which will then be built, adorned, and\r\nenlarged as the prophets Ezekiel and Isaiah and the others declare.\r\n\r\nCh. 81. And, further, a certain man with us, named John, one of the\r\nApostles of Christ, predicted by a revelation that was made to him that\r\nthose who believed in our Christ would spend a thousand years in\r\nJerusalem, and thereafter the general, or to speak briefly, the eternal\r\nresurrection and judgment of all men would likewise take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. The Church and the World\r\n\r\n\r\nSo long as chiliastic expectations were the basis of the Christian’s hope\r\nand his judgment of the order of this present world, the Christian felt\r\nthat he was but a stranger and sojourner in the world, and that his real\r\nhome was the kingdom of Christ, soon to be established here on earth. With\r\nsuch a view the Christian would naturally define his relation to the world\r\nas being in it, yet not of it. As time passed, the opinion became more\r\ncommon that the kingdom of Christ was not a future world-order to be set\r\nup on His return, but the Church here on earth. This thought, which is the\r\nkey to the _City of God_ by St. Augustine, was not to be found in the\r\nfirst century and a half of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ep. ad Diognetum_, 5, 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Epistle to Diognetus is one of the choicest pieces of\r\n    ante-Nicene literature. Although it is commonly included among the\r\n    Apostolic Fathers, the date is uncertain, it is anonymous, and the\r\n    reason for its inclusion is not clear. The weight of opinion is in\r\n    favor of an early date. It was preserved in but one manuscript,\r\n    which was unfortunately destroyed in 1870. The main themes of the\r\n    epistle are the faith and manners of the Christians, and an\r\n    attempt to explain the late appearance of Christianity in the\r\n    world. The work, therefore, is of the nature of an apology, and\r\n    should be compared with _The Apology of Aristides_. A translation\r\n    of the epistle may be found in ANF, I, 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 5. The Christians are distinguished from other men neither by country,\r\nnor language, nor the customs which they observe. For they neither inhabit\r\ncities of their own, nor employ a peculiar form of speech, nor lead a life\r\nwhich is marked out by any singularity. The course of conduct which they\r\nfollow has not been devised by any speculation or deliberation of\r\ninquisitive men; nor do they, like some, proclaim themselves the advocates\r\nof any merely human doctrines. But, inhabiting Greek as well as barbarian\r\ncities, according as the lot of each of them has been determined, and\r\nfollowing the customs of the natives in respect to clothing, food, and the\r\nrest of their ordinary conduct, they display to us their wonderful and\r\nconfessedly striking method of life. They dwell in their own countries,\r\nbut simply as sojourners. As citizens, they share in all things with\r\nothers, and yet endure all things as if foreigners. Every foreign country\r\nis to them as their native land, and every land of their birth as a land\r\nof strangers. They marry as do all; they beget children; but they do not\r\ncommit abortion. They have a common table, but not a common bed. They are\r\nin the flesh, but they do not live after the flesh. They pass their days\r\non earth, but they are the citizens of heaven. They obey the prescribed\r\nlaws, and at the same time surpass the laws by their lives. They love all\r\nmen, and are persecuted by all. They are unknown and condemned; they are\r\nput to death and restored to life. They are poor, yet they make many rich;\r\nthey are in lack of all things, and yet abound in all. They are\r\ndishonored, and yet in their very dishonor are glorified. They are\r\nevil-spoken of, and yet are justified. They are reviled and bless; they\r\nare insulted and repay insult with honor; they do good, yet are punished\r\nas evil-doers. When punished they rejoice as if quickened into life; they\r\nare assailed by the Jews as foreigners and are persecuted by the Greeks;\r\nyet those who hate them are unable to assign a reason for their hatred.\r\n\r\nCh. 6. What the soul is in the body, that the Christians are in the world.\r\nThe soul is spread through all the members of the body, and Christians\r\nthrough the cities of the world. The soul dwells in the body, but is not\r\nof the body; so Christians dwell in the world, but they are not of the\r\nworld. The invisible soul is guarded in the visible body; so Christians\r\nare known as existing in the world, but their religion remains invisible.\r\nThe flesh hates the soul and wages war on it, though it has received no\r\nwrong, because it is forbidden to indulge in pleasures; so the world hates\r\nChristians, though it receives no wrong from them, because they are\r\nopposed to its pleasures. The soul loves the flesh which hates it, and it\r\nloves the members; so Christians love those who hate them. The soul is\r\nenclosed in the body, yet itself holds the body together; so the\r\nChristians are kept in the world as in a prison-house, yet they themselves\r\nhold the world together. The immortal soul dwells in a mortal tabernacle;\r\nso Christians sojourn amid corruptible things, looking for the\r\nincorruptibility in the heavens. The soul when hardly treated in the\r\nmatter of meats and drinks is improved; so Christians when punished\r\nincrease more and more daily. In so great an office has God appointed\r\nthem, which it is not lawful for them to decline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12. Theological Ideas\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the post-apostolic period are to be traced the beginnings of\r\ndistinctive forms of religious and ethical ideas as distinguished from\r\nmere repetition of New Testament phrases. The most influential writer was\r\nIgnatius of Antioch, the founder, or earliest representative, of what may\r\nbe called the Asia Minor theology, which is to be traced through Irenæus,\r\nMethodius, and Athanasius to the other great theologians of the Nicene\r\nperiod, becoming the distinctive Eastern type of piety. It probably\r\npersisted in Asia Minor after Ignatius. Among its characteristic features\r\nwas the thought of redemption as the imparting to man of incorruptibility\r\nthrough the incarnation and the sacraments.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Ignatius, _Ep. ad Ephesios_, 18 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Epistle to the Ephesians is doctrinally the most important of\r\n    the writings of Ignatius. In the passage that follows there is a\r\n    remarkable anticipation of a part of the Apostles’ Creed (_cf._\r\n    Hahn. § 1). The whole passage contains in brief the fundamental\r\n    point of the writer’s teachings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 18. My spirit is an offering(15) of the cross, which is a\r\nstumbling-block to unbelievers, but to us salvation and life eternal.\r\n“Where is the wise man? where the disputer?” [I Cor. 1:20.] Where is the\r\nboasting of those called prudent? For our God, Jesus Christ, was,\r\naccording to the dispensation of God, conceived in the womb of Mary of the\r\nseed of David, but of the Holy Ghost. He was born and baptized, that by\r\nHis passion He might purify the water.\r\n\r\nCh. 19. And the virginity of Mary was hidden from the Prince of this\r\nWorld, and her bringing forth, and likewise the death of the Lord; three\r\nmysteries of shouting, which were wrought in silence of God. How, then,\r\nwas He manifested to the world? A star shone forth from heaven above all\r\nother stars, and its light was inexpressible, while its novelty struck men\r\nwith astonishment, but all the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon,\r\nformed a chorus to this star, and its light was exceedingly great above\r\nthem all. And there was agitation whence this novelty, so unlike to\r\neverything else. Hence every kind of magic was destroyed and every bond of\r\nwickedness disappeared; ignorance was removed and the old kingdom\r\nabolished, for God had been manifested in human form for the renewal of\r\neternal life. And now that took a beginning which had been prepared by\r\nGod. Henceforth all things were in a state of tumult because He meditated\r\nthe abolition of death.\r\n\r\nCh. 20. … Especially [will I write again] if the Lord make known to me\r\nthat ye all, man by man, through grace given to each, agree in one faith\r\nand in Jesus Christ, who was of the family of David according to the\r\nflesh, the Son of Man and the Son of God, so that ye obey the bishop and\r\nthe presbytery with an undivided mind, breaking one bread, which is the\r\nmedicine of immortality, and the antidote to prevent dying, but which is\r\nlife forever in Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Ignatius, _Ep. ad Smyrnæos_, 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following passage may be regarded as a parallel to part of the\r\n    preceding extract from the same writer’s Epistle to the Ephesians.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey abstain from the eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not\r\nthat the eucharist is the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which\r\nsuffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up\r\nagain. Those, therefore, who speak against this gift of God, die while\r\ndisputing. But it were better for them to love it, that they also may rise\r\nagain. It is fitting, therefore, that ye should keep aloof from such\r\npersons, and not speak of them either in private or public, but to give\r\nheed to the prophets and, above all, to the Gospel, in which the passion\r\nhas been revealed to us and the resurrection fully proved. But avoid all\r\ndivisions as the beginning of evils.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Ignatius, _Ep. ad Trallianos_, 9, 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The heresy which the writer fears is that known as Docetism, which\r\n    denied the reality of the body of Jesus. Reference is made to it\r\n    in the New Testament, I John 4:2. It was based upon the same\r\n    philosophical idea as much of the later Gnostic speculation, that\r\n    matter is essentially evil, and therefore a pure spirit could not\r\n    be united to a real body composed of matter. See J. B. Lightfoot,\r\n    _Apostolic Fathers_, pt. II, vol. II, p. 173 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 9. Be ye therefore deaf when any one speaks to you apart from Jesus\r\nChrist, who was of the race of David, who was born of Mary, who was truly\r\nborn and ate and drank, who was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate, who\r\nwas truly crucified and died while those in heaven and those on earth and\r\nthose under the earth looked on; who, also, was truly raised from the\r\ndead, His Father having raised Him, who in like fashion will raise us who\r\nbelieve in Him; His Father, I say, will raise us in Christ Jesus, apart\r\nfrom whom we have not true life.\r\n\r\nCh. 10. But if it were as certain persons who are godless, that is,\r\nunbelievers, say, that He only appeared to suffer, they themselves being\r\nonly in appearance, why am I bound? And why, also, do I desire to fight\r\nwith wild beasts? I therefore die in vain. Truly, then, I lie against the\r\nLord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13. Worship in the Post-Apostolic Period\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worship of the Christian Church in the earliest period centred in the\r\neucharist. There are references to this in the New Testament (_cf._ Acts\r\n2:42; 20:7; I Cor. 10:16). How far the agape was connected with the\r\neucharist is uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: See Pliny’s letter to Trajan (_v.\r\n    supra_, § 7); the selections from Ignatius already given (_v.\r\n    supra_, § 12) and the _Didache_ (_v. infra_, § 14, _a_).\r\n\r\n\r\nJustin Martyr, _Apologia_, I, 61:65-67. (MSG, 6:428 _ff._) _Cf._ Mirbt, n.\r\n18.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _First Apology_ of Justin Martyr was written probably about\r\n    150. As Justin’s work is dated, and is of indisputable\r\n    authenticity, his account of the early worship of the Christians\r\n    is of the very first importance. It should be noted, however,\r\n    that, inasmuch as he is writing for non-Christians, he uses no\r\n    technical terms in his description, and therefore nothing can be\r\n    determined as to the exact significance of the titles he applies\r\n    to the presiding officer at the eucharist. The following passage\r\n    is of importance, also, as a witness to the custom of reading, in\r\n    the course of Christian public worship, books that appear to be\r\n    the Gospels. Irenæus, thirty years later, limits the number of the\r\n    Gospels to four, _v. infra_, § 28. On the eucharist, _v. infra_, §\r\n    33.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 61. But I will explain the manner in which we who have been made new\r\nthrough Christ have also dedicated ourselves to God, lest by passing it\r\nover I should seem in any way to be unfair in my explanation. As many as\r\nare persuaded and believe that the things are true which are taught and\r\nsaid by us, and promise that they are able to live accordingly, they are\r\ntaught to pray and with fasting to ask God forgiveness of their former\r\nsins, while we pray and fast with them. Thereupon they are brought by us\r\nto where there is water, and are born again in the same manner of a new\r\nbirth as we, also, ourselves were born again. For in the name of God the\r\nFather and Lord of all, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy\r\nSpirit, they then receive the washing in the water. For Christ said:\r\n“Except ye be born again, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.”\r\nBut that it is impossible for those once born to enter into the wombs of\r\ntheir mothers is manifest to all.… And this washing is called\r\nenlightenment, because those who learn these things have their\r\nunderstandings enlightened. But, also, in the name of Jesus Christ who was\r\ncrucified under Pontius Pilate, and in the name of the Holy Spirit who by\r\nthe prophets foretold all things pertaining to Jesus, he who is\r\nilluminated is washed.\r\n\r\nCh. 65. But after we have thus washed him who is persuaded and has\r\nassented, we bring him to those who are called the brethren, to where they\r\nare gathered together, making earnest prayer in common for ourselves and\r\nfor him who is enlightened, and for all others everywhere, that we may be\r\naccounted worthy, after we have learned the truth, by our works also to be\r\nfound right livers and keepers of the commandments, that we may be saved\r\nwith the eternal salvation. We salute each other with a kiss when we\r\nconclude our prayers. Thereupon to the president of the brethren bread and\r\na cup of water and wine are brought, and he takes it and offers up praise\r\nand glory to the Father of the universe through the name of the Son and\r\nthe Holy Spirit, and gives thanks at length that we have been accounted\r\nworthy of these things from Him; and when he has ended the prayers and\r\nthanksgiving the whole people present assent, saying “Amen.” Now the word\r\nAmen in the Hebrew language signifies, So be it. Then after the president\r\nhas given thanks and all the people have assented, those who are called by\r\nus deacons give to each one of those present to partake of the bread and\r\nof the wine and water for which thanks have been given, and for those not\r\npresent they take away a portion.\r\n\r\nCh. 66. And this food is called by us eucharist, and it is not lawful for\r\nany man to partake of it but him who believes the things taught by us to\r\nbe true, and has been washed with the washing which is for the remission\r\nof sins and unto a new birth, and is so living as Christ commanded. For\r\nnot as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but just as\r\nJesus Christ our Saviour, being made flesh through the word of God, had\r\nfor our salvation both flesh and blood, so, also, we are taught that the\r\nfood for which thanks are given by the word of prayer which is from Him,\r\nand from which by conversion our flesh and blood are nourished, is the\r\nflesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh. For the Apostles in the\r\nmemoirs composed by them, which are called Gospels, thus delivered what\r\nwas commanded them: that Jesus took bread and gave thanks and said, This\r\ndo in remembrance of Me, this is My body; and that He likewise took the\r\ncup, and when He had given thanks, said, This is My blood, and gave only\r\nto them. And this the evil demons imitating, commanded it to be done also\r\nin the mysteries of Mithras; for that bread and a cup of water are set\r\nforth with certain explanations in the ceremonial of initiation, you\r\neither know or can learn.\r\n\r\nCh. 67. But we afterward always remind one another of these things, and\r\nthose among us who are wealthy help all who are in want, and we always\r\nremain together. And for all things we eat we bless the Maker of all\r\nthings through His Son Jesus Christ and through the Holy Spirit. And on\r\nthe day called the Day of the Sun there is a gathering in one place of us\r\nall who live in cities or in the country, and the memoirs of the Apostles\r\nor the writings of the prophets are read as long as time allows. Then,\r\nwhen the reader has ceased, the president gives by word of mouth his\r\nadmonition and exhortation to imitate these excellent things. Afterward we\r\nall rise at once and offer prayers; and as I said, when we have ceased to\r\npray, bread is brought and wine and water, and the president likewise\r\noffers up prayers and thanksgivings as he has the ability, and the people\r\nassent, saying “Amen.” The distribution to each and the partaking of that\r\nfor which thanks were given then take place; and to those not present a\r\nportion is sent by the hands of the deacons. Those who are well-to-do and\r\nwilling give, every one giving what he will, according to his own\r\njudgment, and the collection is deposited with the president, and he\r\nassists orphans and widows, and those who through sickness or any other\r\ncause are in want, and those who are in bonds, and the strangers that are\r\nsojourning, and, in short, he has the care of all that are in need. Now we\r\nall hold our common meeting on the Day of the Sun, because it is the first\r\nday on which God, having changed the darkness and matter, created the\r\nworld; and Jesus Christ our Saviour on the same day rose from the dead.\r\nFor on the day before Saturn’s they crucified Him; and on the day after\r\nSaturn’s, which is the Day of the Sun, having appeared to his Apostles and\r\ndisciples, He taught them these things which we have offered you for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 14. Church Organization\r\n\r\n\r\nNo subject in Church history has been more hotly discussed than the\r\norganization of the primitive Christian Church. Each of several Christian\r\nconfessions have attempted to justify a polity which it regarded as _de\r\nfide_ by appeal to the organization of the Church of the primitive ages.\r\nSince it has been seen that the admission of the principle of development\r\ndoes not invalidate claims for divine warrant for a polity, the\r\nacrimonious debate has been somewhat stilled. There seems to have been in\r\nthe Church several forms of organization, and to some extent the various\r\ncontentions of conflicting creeds and polities have been therein\r\njustified. The ultimately universal form, episcopacy, may in some parts of\r\nthe Church be traced to the end of the apostolic age, but it seems not to\r\nhave been universally diffused at that time. Since Christian communities\r\nsprang up without official propaganda, at least in many instances, and\r\nwere due to the work of independent Christian believers moving about in\r\nthe Empire, this variety of organization was what might have been\r\nexpected, especially as the significance of the organization was first\r\nfelt chiefly in connection with the danger from heresy. That various\r\nexternal influences affected the development is also highly probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Clement of Rome, _Ep. ad Corinthios_, I, 42, 44.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 42. The Apostles have preached the Gospel to us from the Lord Jesus\r\nChrist; Jesus Christ was sent forth from God. Christ, therefore, was from\r\nGod, and the Apostles from Christ. Both these appointments, then, came\r\nabout in an orderly way, by the will of God. Having, therefore, received\r\ntheir orders, and being fully assured by the resurrection of our Lord\r\nJesus Christ, and established in the word of God, with full assurance of\r\nthe Holy Ghost, they went forth proclaiming that the kingdom of God was at\r\nhand. And thus preaching through countries and cities, they appointed\r\ntheir first-fruits, having proved them by the Spirit, to be bishops and\r\ndeacons of those who should afterward believe. Nor was this a new thing;\r\nfor, indeed, many ages before it was written concerning bishops and\r\ndeacons. For thus saith the Scripture in a certain place: “I will appoint\r\ntheir bishops in righteousness, and their deacons in faith.”(16)\r\n\r\nCh. 44. Our Apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that there\r\nwould be strife on account of the office of the episcopate.(17) For this\r\ncause, therefore, inasmuch as they had obtained a perfect foreknowledge of\r\nthis, they appointed those already mentioned, and afterward gave\r\ninstructions that when these should fall asleep other approved men should\r\nsucceed them in their ministry. We are of the opinion, therefore, that\r\nthose appointed by them, or afterward by other eminent men, with the\r\nconsent of the whole Church, and who have blamelessly served the flock of\r\nChrist in lowliness of mind, peaceably, and with all modesty, and for a\r\nlong time have borne a good report with all—these men we consider to be\r\nunjustly thrust out of their ministrations.(18) For it will be no light\r\nsin for us, if we thrust out those who have offered the gifts of the\r\nbishop’s office blamelessly and holily. Blessed are those presbyters who\r\nhave gone before seeing their departure was fruitful and ripe; for they\r\nhave no fear lest any one should remove them from their appointed place.\r\nFor we see that ye have displaced certain persons, though they were living\r\nhonorably, from the ministration which had been honored by them\r\nblamelessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Didache_, 7-15.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Didache_ is a very early manual of the instruction for\r\n    Christian converts. It consists of two quite distinct parts, viz.,\r\n    a brief account of the moral law (chapters 1-6). which appears to\r\n    be based upon a Jewish original to which the name of _The Two\r\n    Ways_ has been given, and a somewhat longer account of the various\r\n    rites of the Church and the regulations governing its\r\n    organization. Its date is in the first half of the second century\r\n    and belongs more probably to the first quarter than to the second.\r\n    It is a document of first-class importance, especially in the part\r\n    bearing on the organization of the Church, which is here given.\r\n    The extensive literature on the subject may be found in Krüger.\r\n    _op. cit._, Â§ 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 7. But concerning baptism, thus shall ye baptize. Having first recited\r\nall these things, baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of\r\nthe Holy Spirit in living [_i.e._, running] water. But if thou hast not\r\nliving water, then baptize in any other water; and if thou art not able in\r\ncold, in warm. But if thou hast neither, pour water upon the head thrice\r\nin the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. But\r\nbefore baptism let him that baptizeth and him that is baptized fast, and\r\nany others also who are able; and thou shalt order him that is baptized to\r\nfast a day or two before.\r\n\r\nCh. 8. And let not your fastings be with the hypocrites. For they fast on\r\nthe second and the fifth days of the week; but do ye keep your fast on the\r\nfourth and on the preparation [_i.e._, the sixth day]. Neither pray ye as\r\nthe hypocrites, but as the Lord commanded in His Gospel, thus pray ye: Our\r\nFather who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will\r\nbe done, as in heaven, so also on earth; give us this day our daily(19)\r\nbread; and forgive us our debt, as we also forgive our debtors; and lead\r\nus not into temptation, but deliver us from the Evil One; for Thine is the\r\npower and the glory forever.(20) Three times in the day pray ye so.\r\n\r\nCh. 9. But as regards the eucharist [thanksgiving], give ye thanks thus.\r\nFirst, as regards the cup: We give Thee thanks, O our Father, for the holy\r\nvine of David, Thy Son, which Thou madest known unto us through Jesus, Thy\r\nSon; Thine is the glory forever. Then as regards the breaking [_i.e._, of\r\nthe bread]: We give thanks to Thee, O our Father, for the life and\r\nknowledge which thou madest known unto us through Jesus, Thy Son; Thine is\r\nthe glory forever. As this broken bread was scattered upon the mountains\r\nand being gathered together became one, so may Thy Church be gathered\r\ntogether from the ends of the earth into Thy kingdom; for Thine is the\r\nglory and the power through Jesus Christ for ever and ever. But let no one\r\neat or drink of this eucharist [thanksgiving] but they that have been\r\nbaptized into the name of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord hath\r\nsaid: Give not that which is holy unto the dogs.\r\n\r\nCh. 10. After ye are satisfied give thanks thus: We give Thee thanks, Holy\r\nFather, for Thy holy name, which Thou hast made to tabernacle in our\r\nhearts, and for the knowledge and faith and immortality, which Thou hast\r\nmade known unto us through Thy Son Jesus; Thine is the glory forever.\r\nThou, Almighty Master, created all things for Thy name’s sake, and gave\r\nfood and drink unto men for enjoyment, that they might render thanks to\r\nThee; but bestowed upon us spiritual food and drink and eternal life\r\nthrough Thy Son. Before all things we give Thee thanks that Thou art\r\npowerful; Thine is the glory forever. Remember, Lord, Thy Church to\r\ndeliver it from all evil and to perfect it in Thy love; and gather it\r\ntogether from the four winds—even the Church which has been\r\nsanctified—into Thy kingdom which Thou hast prepared for it; for Thine is\r\nthe power and the glory forever. May grace come and may this world pass\r\naway. Hosanna to the God of David. If any one is holy let him come; if any\r\none is not, let him repent. Maran Atha. Amen. But permit the prophets to\r\noffer thanksgiving as much as they will.\r\n\r\nCh. 11. Whosoever, therefore, shall come and teach you all these things\r\nthat have been said receive him; but if the teacher himself be perverted\r\nand teach a different doctrine to the destruction thereof, hear him not;\r\nbut if to the increase of righteousness and knowledge of the Lord, receive\r\nhim as the Lord.\r\n\r\nBut concerning the apostles and prophets, so do ye according to the\r\nordinance of the Gospel: Let every apostle coming to you be received as\r\nthe Lord; but he shall not abide more than a single day, or if there be\r\nneed, a second likewise; but if he abide three days, he is a false\r\nprophet. And when he departs, let not the apostle receive anything save\r\nbread until he find shelter; but if he ask money, he is a false prophet.\r\nAnd any prophet speaking in the Spirit ye shall not try, neither discern;\r\nfor every sin shall be forgiven, but this sin shall not be forgiven. Yet\r\nnot every one that speaketh in the Spirit is a prophet, but only if he\r\nhave the ways of the Lord. From his ways, therefore, the false prophet and\r\nthe [true] prophet shall be recognized. And no prophet when he ordereth a\r\ntable in the Spirit shall eat of it; otherwise he is a false prophet.(21)\r\nAnd every prophet teaching the truth, if he doeth not what he teacheth, is\r\na false prophet. And every prophet approved and found true, working unto a\r\nworldly mystery of the Church,(22) and yet teacheth not to do what he\r\nhimself doeth, shall not be judged before you; he hath his judgment in the\r\npresence of God; for in like manner also did the ancient prophets. And\r\nwhosoever shall say in the Spirit, Give me silver or anything else, do not\r\nlisten to him; but if he say to give on behalf of others who are in want,\r\nlet no one judge him.\r\n\r\nCh. 12. But let every one coming in the name of the Lord be received; and\r\nwhen ye have tested him ye shall know him, for ye shall have understanding\r\non the right hand and on the left. If the comer is a traveller, assist him\r\nas ye are able; but let him not stay with you but for two or three days,\r\nif it be necessary. But if he wishes to settle with you, being a\r\ncraftsman, let him work and eat. But if he has no craft, according to your\r\nwisdom provide how without idleness he shall live as a Christian among\r\nyou. If he will not do this, he is trafficking upon Christ. Beware of such\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nCh. 13. But every true prophet desiring to settle among you is worthy of\r\nhis food. In like manner, a true teacher is also worthy, like the workman,\r\nof his food. Every first-fruit, then, of the produce of the wine-vat and\r\nof the threshing-floor, of thy oxen and of thy sheep, thou shalt take and\r\ngive as the first-fruit to the prophets; for they are your chief priests.\r\nBut if ye have not a prophet, give them to the poor. If thou makest bread,\r\ntake the first-fruit and give according to the commandment. In like\r\nmanner, when thou openest a jar of wine or oil, take the first-fruit and\r\ngive to the prophets; yea, and of money and raiment and every possession\r\ntake the first-fruit, as shall seem good to thee, and give according to\r\nthe commandment.\r\n\r\nCh. 14. And on the Lord’s day gather yourselves together and break bread\r\nand give thanks, first confessing your transgressions, that your sacrifice\r\nmay be pure. And let no man having a dispute with his fellow join your\r\nassembly until they have been reconciled, that your sacrifice may not be\r\ndefiled; for this is the sacrifice spoken of by the Lord: In every place\r\nand at every time offer me a pure sacrifice; for I am a great king, saith\r\nthe Lord, and my name is wonderful among the nations. [Mal. 1:11, 14.]\r\n\r\nCh. 15. Appoint [_i.e._, lay hands on], therefore, for yourselves bishops\r\nand deacons worthy of the Lord, men meek, not lovers of money, truthful,\r\nand approved; for they also render you the service of prophets and\r\nteachers. Despise them not, therefore, for they are your honored ones\r\ntogether with the prophets and teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Ignatius, _Ep. ad Trallianos_, 2, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n    For Ignatius, see § 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 2. For since ye are subject to the bishop as Jesus Christ, ye appear\r\nto me to live not after the manner of men, but according to Jesus Christ,\r\nwho died for us, in order that by believing in His death ye may escape\r\ndeath. It is therefore necessary that just as ye indeed do, so without the\r\nbishop ye should do nothing, but should also be subject to the presbytery,\r\nas to the Apostles of Jesus Christ, our Hope, living in whom we shall be\r\nfound [_i.e._, at the last]. It is right, also, that the deacons, being\r\n[ministers] of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, should in every respect be\r\nwell-pleasing to all. For they are not the ministers of meats and drinks,\r\nbut servants of the Church of God. It is necessary, therefore, that they\r\nguard themselves from all grounds of accusation as they would from fire.\r\n\r\nCh. 3. In like manner, let all reverence the deacons as Jesus Christ, as\r\nalso the bishop, who is a type of the Father, and the presbyters as the\r\nsanhedrim of God and the assembly of the Apostles. Apart from these there\r\nis no Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Ignatius, _Ep. ad Smyrnæos_, 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee that ye follow the bishop as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the\r\npresbyters as ye would the Apostles; and reverence the deacons as a\r\ncommandment of God. Without the bishop let no one do any of those things\r\nconnected with the Church. Let that be deemed a proper eucharist which is\r\nadministered either by the bishop or by him to whom he has intrusted it.\r\nWherever the bishop shall appear there let also the multitude be, even as\r\nwherever Jesus Christ is there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful\r\nwithout the bishop either to baptize or to make an agape. But whatsoever\r\nhe shall approve that is also pleasing to God, so that everything that is\r\ndone may be secure and valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 15. Church Discipline\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church was the company of the saints. How far, then, could the Church\r\ntolerate in its midst those who had committed serious offences against the\r\nmoral law? A case had occurred in the Corinthian church about which St.\r\nPaul had given some instructions to the Christians of that city (_cf._ I\r\nCor. 5:3-5; II Cor. 13:10). There was the idea current that sins after\r\nbaptism admitted of no pardon and involved permanent exclusion from the\r\nChurch (_cf._ Heb. 10:26). A distinction was also made as to sins whereby\r\nsome were regarded as “sins unto death” and not admitting of pardon (_cf._\r\nI John 5:16). In principle, the exclusion from the Church of those who had\r\ncommitted gross sins was recognized, but as the Church grew it soon became\r\na serious question as to the extent to which this strict discipline could\r\nbe enforced. We find, therefore, a well-defined movement toward relaxing\r\nthis rigor of the law. The beginning appears in Hermas, who admits the\r\npossibility of one repentance after baptism. A special problem was\r\npresented from the first by the difference between the conceptions of\r\nmarriage held by the Christians and by the heathen. The Church very early\r\ntook the position that marriage in some sense was indissoluble, that so\r\nlong as both parties to a marriage lived, neither could marry again, but\r\nafter the death of one party the surviving spouse could remarry, although\r\nthis second marriage was looked upon with some disfavor. Both the idea of\r\na second repentance and the idea of the indissolubility of marriage are\r\nexpressed in the following extract from Hermas:\r\n\r\n\r\nHermas, _Pastor_, Man. IV, I, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hermas wrote in the second century. Opinions have varied as to his\r\n    date, some putting him near the beginning, some near the middle of\r\n    the century. The weight of opinion seems to be that he lived\r\n    shortly before 150. His work entitled _The Pastor_ is in the form\r\n    of revelations, and was therefore thought to partake of an\r\n    inspiration similar to that of Holy Scripture. This naturally gave\r\n    it a place among Scriptures for a while and accounts for the great\r\n    popularity of the work in the early Church. It is the best example\r\n    of an extensive apocalyptic literature which flourished in the\r\n    Church in the first two centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 1. If the husband should not take her back [_i.e._, the penitent wife\r\nwho has committed adultery] he sins, and brings a great sin upon himself;\r\nfor he ought to take back her who has sinned and repented; but not\r\nfrequently; for there is but one repentance to the servants of God\r\n[_i.e._, after becoming the servants of God]. On account of her repentance\r\n[_i.e._, because she may repent, and therefore should be taken back] the\r\nhusband ought not to marry. This treatment applies to the woman and to the\r\nman.\r\n\r\nCh. 3. And I said to him: “I should like to continue my questions.” “Speak\r\non,” said he. And I said: “I have heard, sir, from some teachers that\r\nthere is no other repentance than that when we descend into the water and\r\nreceive remission of our former sins.” He said to me: “Thou hast well\r\nheard, for so it is. For he who has received remission of his sins ought\r\nto sin no more, but to live in purity. Since, however, you inquire\r\ndiligently into all things, I will point out this also to you, not as\r\ngiving occasion for error to those who are to believe, or have lately\r\nbelieved, in the Lord. For those who have now believed and those who are\r\nto believe have not repentance of their sins, but they have remission of\r\ntheir former sins. For to those who have been called before these days the\r\nLord has set repentance. For the Lord, who knows the heart and foreknows\r\nall things, knew the weakness of men and the manifold wiles of the devil,\r\nthat he would inflict some evil on the servants of God and would act\r\nwickedly against them. The Lord, therefore, being merciful, has had mercy\r\non the works of His hands and has set repentance for them; and has\r\nintrusted to me the power over this repentance. And therefore I say unto\r\nyou,” he said, “that if after that great and holy calling any one is\r\ntempted by the devil and sins, he has one repentance. But if thereupon he\r\nshould sin and then repent, to such a man his repentance is of no benefit;\r\nfor with difficulty will he live.”(23)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 16. Moral Ideas in the Post-Apostolic Period\r\n\r\n\r\nChristians were convinced that their religion made the highest possible\r\nmoral demands upon them. They were to live in the world, but remain\r\nuncontaminated by it (_cf._ _supra_, § 11). This belief even candid\r\nheathen were sometimes forced to admit (_cf._ Pliny’s correspondence with\r\nTrajan, _supra_, § 7). The morality of the Christians and the loftiness of\r\ntheir ethical code were common features in the apologies which began to\r\nappear in the post-apostolic period (_cf. The Apology of Aristides,\r\ninfra_, § 20, _a_). Christianity was a revealed code of morals, by the\r\nobservance of which men might escape the fires of hell and obtain the\r\nbliss of immortality (_a_) (_cf. infra_, § 30). At the same time there was\r\ndeveloped a tendency toward asceticism, by which a higher excellence might\r\nbe obtained than the law required of ordinary Christians (_b__, __c_).\r\nThis higher morality was not without its compensations; superior merit was\r\nrecognized by God, and was accordingly rewarded; it might even be applied\r\nto offset sins committed (_d__, __e_). This last idea is to be traced to\r\nthe book of Tobit (cf. also James 5:20; I Peter 4:8). The fuller\r\ndevelopment is to be found in the theology of Tertullian and Cyprian (v.\r\n_infra_, § 39).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Justin Martyr, _Apologia_, I, 10, 12. (MSG, 6:339, 342.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 10. We have received by tradition that God does not need man’s\r\nmaterial offerings, since we see that He himself provides all things. And\r\nwe have been taught, have been convinced, and do believe that He accepts\r\nonly those who imitate the virtues which reside in Him, temperance and\r\njustice and philanthropy, and as many virtues as are peculiar to a God who\r\nis called by no given name. And we have been taught that He in the\r\nbeginning, since He is good, did for man’s sake create all things out of\r\nunformed matter; and if men by their works show themselves worthy of His\r\ndesign, they are deemed worthy, for so we have received, of reigning in\r\ncompany with Him, having become incorruptible and incapable of suffering.\r\nFor as in the beginning He created us when we were not, so we consider\r\nthat, in like manner, those who choose what is pleasing to Him are, on\r\naccount of their choice, deemed worthy of incorruption and of fellowship\r\nwith Him. For the coming into being at first was not in our power; and in\r\norder that we may follow those things which please Him, choosing them by\r\nmeans of the rational faculties with which He has himself endowed us, He\r\nboth persuades us and leads us to faith.…\r\n\r\nCh. 12. And more than all other men are we your helpers and allies in\r\npromoting peace; for we are of the opinion that it is impossible for the\r\nwicked, or the covetous, or the conspirator, or the virtuous to escape the\r\nnotice of God, and that each man goes to eternal punishment or salvation\r\naccording to the deserts of his actions. For if all men knew this, no one\r\nwould choose wickedness, even for a little time, knowing that he goes to\r\nthe eternal punishment of fire; but he would in every respect restrain\r\nhimself and adorn himself with virtue, that he might obtain the good gifts\r\nof God and escape punishment. For those who, on account of the laws and\r\npunishments you impose, endeavor when they offend to escape detection,\r\noffend thinking that it is possible to escape your detection, since you\r\nare but men; but if they learned and were convinced that it is not\r\npossible that anything, whether actually done or only intended, should\r\nescape the notice of God, they would live decently in every respect, on\r\naccount of the penalties threatened, as even you yourselves will admit.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Didache_, 6. _Cf._ Mirbt, n. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee that no one cause thee to err from this way of the teaching, since\r\napart from God it teacheth thee. For if thou art able to bear all the yoke\r\nof the Lord, thou wilt be perfect; but if thou art not able, do what thou\r\nart able. And concerning foods, bear what thou art able; but against that\r\nwhich is sacrificed to idols be exceedingly on thy guard; for it is the\r\nservice of dead gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Hermas, _Pastor_, Man. IV, 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again I asked him, saying: “Sir, since you have been so patient with\r\nme, will you show me this also?” “Speak,” said he. And I said: “If a wife\r\nor husband die, and the widow or widower marry, does he or she commit\r\nsin?” “There is no sin in marrying again,” said he; “but if they remain\r\nunmarried, they gain greater honor and glory with the Lord; but if they\r\nmarry, they do not sin. Guard, therefore, your chastity and purity and you\r\nwill live to God. What commandments I now give you, and what I am to give\r\nyou, keep from henceforth, yea, from the very day when you were intrusted\r\nto me, and I will dwell in your house. And your former sins will be\r\nforgiven, if you keep my commandments. And to all there is forgiveness if\r\nthey keep these my commandments and walk in this chastity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Clement of Rome, _Ep. ad Corinthios_, II, 4, 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 4. Let us, then, not call Him Lord, for that will not save us. For He\r\nsaith: “Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he\r\nthat worketh righteousness.” Wherefore, brethren, let us confess Him by\r\nour works, by loving one another, by not committing adultery, or speaking\r\nevil of one another, or cherishing envy; but by being continent,\r\ncompassionate, and good. We ought also to sympathize with one another, and\r\nnot be avaricious. By such works let us confess Him, and not by those that\r\nare of an opposite kind. And it is not fitting that we should fear men,\r\nbut rather God. For this reason, if we should do such things, the Lord\r\nhath said: “Even though ye were gathered together to me in my very bosom,\r\nyet if ye were not to keep my commandments, I would cast you off, and say\r\nunto you. Depart from me; I know you not, whence ye are, ye workers of\r\niniquity.”(24)\r\n\r\nCh. 16. So then, brethren, having received no small occasion to repent,\r\nwhile we have opportunity, let us turn to God, who called us while we yet\r\nhave One to receive us. For if we renounce these indulgences and conquer\r\nthe soul by not fulfilling its wicked desires, we shall be partakers of\r\nthe mercy of Jesus. Know ye not that the day of judgment draweth nigh like\r\na burning oven, and certain of the heavens and all the earth will melt,\r\nlike lead melting in fire; and then will appear the hidden and manifest\r\ndeeds of men? Good, then, are alms as repentance from sin; better is\r\nfasting than prayer, and alms than both; “charity covereth a multitude of\r\nsins,” and prayer out of a good conscience delivereth from death. Blessed\r\nis every one that shall be found complete in these; for alms lighten the\r\nburden of sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Hermas, _Pastor_, Sim. V, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n“If you do anything good beyond the commandment of God, you will gain for\r\nyourself more abundant glory, and will be more honored before God than you\r\nwould otherwise be. If, therefore, you keep the commandments of God and do\r\nthese services, you will have joy if you observe them according to my\r\ncommandment.” I said unto him: “Sir, whatsoever you command me I will\r\nobserve; for I know that you are with me.” “I will be with you,” he said,\r\n“because you have such a desire for doing good; I will be with all those,”\r\nhe said, “who have such a desire. This fasting,” he continued, “is very\r\ngood, provided the commandments of the Lord be observed. Thus, then, shall\r\nyou observe the fast which you intend to keep. First of all, be on your\r\nguard against every evil word and every evil desire, and purify your heart\r\nfrom all the vanities of this world. If you guard against these things,\r\nyour fasting will be perfect. But do thus: having fulfilled what is\r\nwritten, during the day on which you fast you will taste nothing but bread\r\nand water; and having reckoned up the price of the dishes of that day\r\nwhich you intended to have eaten, you will give it to a widow, an orphan,\r\nor to some one in want, and thus you will be humble-minded, so that he who\r\nhas received benefit from your humility may fill his own soul and pray to\r\nthe Lord for you. If you observe fasting as I have commanded you, your\r\nsacrifice will be acceptable to God, and this fasting will be written\r\ndown; and the service thus performed is noble and sacred and acceptable to\r\nthe Lord.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriod III. The Critical Period: A. D. 140 to A. D. 200\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interval between the close of the post-apostolic age and the end of\r\nthe second century, or from about 140 to 200, may be called the Critical\r\nPeriod of Ancient Christianity. In this period there grew up conceptions\r\nof Christianity which were felt by the Church, as a whole, to be\r\nfundamentally opposed to its essential spirit and to constitute a serious\r\nmenace to the Christian faith as it had been commonly received. These\r\nconceptions, which grew up both alongside of, and within the Church, have\r\nbeen grouped under the term Gnosticism, a generic term including many\r\nwidely divergent types of teaching and various interpretations of\r\nChristian doctrine in the light of Oriental speculation. There were also\r\nreactionary and reformatory movements which were generally felt to be out\r\nof harmony with the development upon which Christian thought and life had\r\nalready entered; such were Montanism and Marcionism. To overcome these\r\ntendencies and movements the Christian churches in the various parts of\r\nthe Roman Empire were forced, on the one hand, to develop more completely\r\nsuch ecclesiastical institutions as would defend what was commonly\r\nregarded as the received faith, and, on the other hand, to pass from a\r\ncondition in which the various Christian communities existed in isolated\r\nautonomy to some form of organization whereby the spiritual unity of the\r\nChurch might become visible and better able to strengthen the several\r\nmembers of that Church in dealing with theological and administrative\r\nproblems. The Church, accordingly, acquired in the Critical Period the\r\nfundamental form of its creed, as an authoritative expression of belief;\r\nthe episcopate, as a universally recognized essential of Church\r\norganization and a defence of tradition; and its canon of Holy Scripture,\r\nat least in fundamentals, as the authoritative primitive witness to the\r\nessential teachings of the Church. It also laid the foundations of the\r\nconciliar system, and the bonds of corporate unity between the scattered\r\ncommunities of the Church were defined and recognized. At the same time,\r\nthe Church developed in its conflict with heathenism an apologetic\r\nliterature, and in its conflict with heresy a polemical literature, in\r\nwhich are to be found the beginnings of its theology or scientific\r\nstatement of Christian truth. Of this theology two lines of development\r\nare to be traced: one a utilization of Greek philosophy which arose from\r\nthe Logos doctrine of the Apologists, and the other a realistic doctrine\r\nof redemption which grew out of the Asia Minor type of Christian teaching,\r\ntraces of which are to be found in Ignatius of Antioch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. The Church In Relation To The Empire And Heathen Culture\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the second century the Church spread rapidly into all\r\nparts of the Empire, and even beyond. It became so prominent that the\r\nrelation of the Church to heathen thought and institutions underwent a\r\nmarked change. Persecutions of Christians became more frequent, and\r\nthereby the popular conviction was deepened that Christians were\r\nmalefactors. To some extent men of letters began to notice the new faith\r\nand attack it. In opposition to persecution and criticism, the Church\r\ndeveloped an active apologetic or defence of Christianity and Christians\r\nagainst heathen aspersions.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 17. The Extension of Christianity\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the head of Extension of Christianity are to be placed only such\r\ntexts as may be regarded as evidence for the presence of the Church in a\r\nwell-defined locality. It is apparent that the evidence must be\r\nincomplete, for many places must have received the Christian faith which\r\nwere unknown to the writers whose works we have or which they had no\r\noccasion to mention. Rhetorical overstatement of the extension of the\r\nChurch was a natural temptation in view of the rapid spread of\r\nChristianity. Each text needs to be scrutinized and its merits assessed.\r\nIt should, however, be borne in mind that the existence of a\r\nwell-established church in any locality is in most cases sufficient reason\r\nfor believing that Christianity had already been there for some time. In\r\nthis way valid historical reasoning carries the date of the extension of\r\nthe Church to a locality somewhat further back than does the date of the\r\nappearance of a document which testifies to the existence of Christianity\r\nin a definite place at a definite time.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Tertullian, _Adv. Judæos_, 7. (MSL, 2:649.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus (circa 160-circa 220 A. D.)\r\n    is the most important ante-Nicene Latin ecclesiastical writer. He\r\n    has been justly regarded as the founder of Latin theology and the\r\n    Christian Latin style. His work is divided into two periods by his\r\n    adherence (between 202 and 207 A. D.) to the Montanistic sect.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The treatise _Adversus Judæos_ probably belongs to Tertullian’s\r\n    pre-Montanist period, though formerly placed among his Montanist\r\n    writings (see Krüger, § 85, 6). For Geographical references, see\r\n    W. Smith, _Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography_.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon whom else have all nations believed but upon the Christ who has\r\nalready come? For whom have the other nations believed—Parthians, Medes,\r\nElamites, and they who inhabit Mesopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Cappadocia,\r\nand those dwelling in Pontus and Asia, and Pamphylia, sojourners in Egypt,\r\nand inhabitants of the region of Africa which is beyond Cyrene, Romans and\r\nsojourners, yes, and in Jerusalem, Jews and other nations;(25) as now the\r\nvaried races of the Gætulians, and manifold confines of the Moors, all the\r\nlimits of Spain, and the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the places of\r\nthe Britons inaccessible to the Romans, but subjugated to Christ, and of\r\nthe Sarmatians and Dacians, and Germans and Scythians, and of many remote\r\nnations and provinces and many islands unknown to us and which we can\r\nhardly enumerate? In all of these places the name of Christ, who has\r\nalready come, now reigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Tertullian, _Apologeticus adversus Gentes pro Christianis_, 37.\r\n(MSL, 1:525.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The date of this work is 197 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are but of yesterday, and we have filled every place among you—cities,\r\nislands, fortresses, towns, market-places, the very camps, tribes,\r\ncompanies, palace, Senate, and Forum. We have left you only the temples.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hæreses_, I, 10, 3. (MSG, 7:551 _f._) For text, see\r\nKirch, § 91.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the Church has received this preaching and this faith, as we have\r\nsaid, the Church, although it is scattered throughout the whole world,\r\ndiligently guards it as if it dwelt in one house; and likewise it believes\r\nthese things as if it had one soul and one heart, and harmoniously it\r\npreaches, teaches, and believes these things as if possessing one mouth.\r\nFor although the languages of the world are dissimilar, yet the import of\r\nthe tradition is one and the same. For the churches which have been\r\nfounded in Germany have not believed nor handed down anything different,\r\nnor have those among the Iberians, nor those among the Gauls, nor those in\r\nthe East, nor those in Egypt, nor those in Libya, nor those which have\r\nbeen established in the central regions(26) of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Bardesanes, _De Fato_. F. Nau, _Bardesane l’astrologue; le livre des\r\nlois des pays_, Paris. 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bardesanes (154-222 A. D.) was the great Christian teacher of\r\n    Edessa. He lived at the court of Abgar IX (179-214), whom,\r\n    according to a doubtful tradition, he is said to have converted.\r\n    The entire book may be found well translated by B. P. Pratten,\r\n    ANF, VIII. 723-734.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Syria and Edessa men used to part with their manhood in honor of\r\nTharatha,(27) but when King Abgar became a believer he commanded that\r\nevery one that did so should have his hand cut off, and from that day\r\nuntil now no one does so in the country of Edessa.\r\n\r\nAnd what shall we say of the new race of us Christians, whom Christ at His\r\nadvent planted in every country and in every region? For, lo, wherever we\r\nare, we are called after the one name of Christ—namely, Christians. On one\r\nday, the first day of the week, we assemble ourselves together, and on the\r\ndays of the readings(28) we abstain from sustenance. The brethren who are\r\nin Gaul do not take males for wives, nor those in Parthia two wives; nor\r\ndo those in Judea circumcise themselves; nor do those of our sisters who\r\nare among the Geli consort with strangers; nor do those of our brethren\r\nwho are in Persia take their daughters for wives; nor do those who are in\r\nMedia abandon their dead or bury them alive or give them as food to the\r\ndogs; nor do those who are in Edessa kill their wives who commit adultery,\r\nnor their sisters, but they withdraw from them, and give them over to the\r\njudgment of God; nor do those who are in Hatra stone thieves to death; but\r\nwherever they are, and in whatever place they are found, the laws of the\r\nseveral countries do not hinder them from obeying the law of their Christ;\r\nnor does the Fate of the celestial governors(29) compel them to make use\r\nof the things which they regard as impure.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 10. (MSG, 20:455.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Missions in the extreme East.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey say that Pantænus displayed such zeal for the divine word that he was\r\nappointed a herald of the Gospel of Christ to the nations of the East and\r\nwas sent as far as India.(30) For indeed there were still many evangelists\r\nof the word who sought earnestly to use their inspired zeal, after the\r\nexample of the Apostles, for the increase and building up of the divine\r\nword. Pantænus was one of these, and he is said to have gone to India. The\r\nreport is that among persons in that country who knew of Christ he found\r\nthe Gospel according to Matthew, which had anticipated his own arrival.\r\nFor Bartholomew, one of the Apostles, had preached to them and left them\r\nthe writing of Matthew in the Hebrew language, and they had preserved it\r\ntill that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 18. Heathen Religious Feeling and Culture in Relation to Christianity\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Christian religion in the course of the latter part of the second\r\ncentury began to attract the attention of heathen writers; it became an\r\nobject of literary attack. The principal literary opponent of Christianity\r\nwas Celsus, who subjected the Christian traditions and customs to a\r\nsearching criticism to prove that they were absurd, unscientific, and\r\nfalse. Lucian of Samosata, does not seem to have attacked Christianity\r\nfrom any philosophical or religious interest, but treated it as an object\r\nof derision, making sport of it. There were also in circulation\r\ninnumerable heathen calumnies, many of the most abominable character.\r\nThese have been preserved only by Christian writers. It was chiefly in\r\nreference to these calumnies that the Christian apologists wrote. The\r\nanswer to Celsus made by Origen belongs to a later period, though Celsus\r\nrepresents the best philosophical criticism of Christianity of the latter\r\npart of the second century.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Celsus, _The True Word_, in Origen, _Contra Celsum_. (MSG, 11:651\r\n_ff._)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The work of Celsus against Christianity, or _The True Word_,\r\n    written about 178, is lost, but it has been so incorporated in the\r\n    elaborate reply of Origen that it can be reconstructed without\r\n    much difficulty. This Theodor Keim has done. The following\r\n    extracts from Origen’s _Contra Celsum_ are quotations from Celsus\r\n    or references to his criticism of Christianity. For Origen, _v.\r\n    infra_, § 43, _b_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI, 1. (MSG, 11:651.) Wishing to throw discredit upon Christianity, the\r\nfirst point Celsus brings forward is that the Christians have entered\r\nsecretly into associations with each other which are forbidden by the\r\nlaws; saying that “of associations some are public, others again secret;\r\nand the former are permitted by the laws; the latter are prohibited by the\r\nlaws.”\r\n\r\nI, 4. (MSG, 11:661.) Let us notice, also, how he thinks to cast discredit\r\nupon our system of morals as neither venerable nor a new branch of\r\ninstruction, inasmuch as it is common to other philosophers.\r\n\r\nI, 9. (MSG, 11:672.) He says that “Certain of them do not wish either to\r\ngive or to receive reasons for those things to which they hold; saying,\r\n‘Do not examine, only believe and your faith will save you!’ ”; and he\r\nalleges that such also say: “The wisdom of this life is bad, but\r\nfoolishness is a good thing.”\r\n\r\nI, 38. (MSG, 11:733.) He admits somehow the miracles which Jesus wrought\r\nand by means of which He induced the multitude to follow Him as the\r\nChrist. He wishes to throw discredit on them, as having been done not by\r\ndivine power, but by help of magic, for he says: “That he [Jesus], having\r\nbeen brought up secretly and having served for hire in Egypt, and then\r\ncoming to the knowledge of certain miraculous powers, returned from\r\nthence, and by means of those powers proclaimed himself a god.”\r\n\r\nII, 55. (MSG, 11:884.) “Come, now, let us grant to you that these things\r\n[the prediction made by Christ of His resurrection] were said. Yet how\r\nmany others are there who have used such wonders to deceive their simple\r\nhearers, and who made gain of their deception? Such was the case, they\r\nsay, with Zalmoxis in Scythia, the slave of Pythagoras; and with\r\nPythagoras himself in Italy.… But the point to be considered is, whether\r\nany one who was really dead ever rose with a veritable body. Or do you\r\nimagine the statements of others not only are myths, but appear as such,\r\nbut you have discovered a becoming and credible termination of your drama,\r\nthe voice from the cross when he breathed his last, the earthquake and the\r\ndarkness? that while living he was of no help to himself, but when dead he\r\nrose again, and showed the marks of his punishment and his hands as they\r\nhad been. Who saw this? A frantic woman, as you state, and, if any other,\r\nperhaps one of those who were engaged in the same delusion, who, owing to\r\na peculiar state of mind, had either dreamed so, or with a wandering fancy\r\nhad imagined things in accordance with his own wishes, which has happened\r\nin the case of very many; or, which is most probable, there was some one\r\nwho desired to impress the others with this portent, and by such a\r\nfalsehood to furnish an occasion to other jugglers.”\r\n\r\nII, 63. (MSG, 11:896.) “If Jesus desired to show that his power was really\r\ndivine, he ought to have appeared to those who had ill-treated him, and to\r\nhim who had condemned him, and to all men universally.”\r\n\r\nIII, 59. (MSG, 11:997.) “That I bring no heavier charge than what truth\r\nrequires, let any one judge from the following. Those who invite to\r\nparticipation in other mysteries make proclamation as follows: ‘Every one\r\nwho has clean hands and a prudent tongue’; others again thus: ‘He who is\r\npure from every pollution, and whose soul is conscious of no evil, and who\r\nhas lived well and justly.’ Such is the proclamation made by those who\r\npromise purification from sins. But let us hear whom the Christians\r\ninvite. ‘Whoever,’ they say, ‘is a sinner, whoever is devoid of\r\nunderstanding, whoever is a child,’ and, to speak generally, ‘whoever is\r\nunfortunate, him will the kingdom of God receive.’ Do you not call him a\r\nsinner, then, who is unjust and a thief and a house-breaker and a\r\npoisoner, a committer of sacrilege and a robber of the dead? Whom else\r\nwould a man invite if he were issuing a proclamation for an assembly of\r\nrobbers?”\r\n\r\nVII, 18. (MSG, 11:1445.) “Will they not again make this reflection: If the\r\nprophets of the God of the Jews foretold that he who should come was the\r\nson of this same God, how could he command them through Moses to gather\r\nwealth, to rule, to fill the earth, to put to the sword their enemies from\r\nyouth up, and to destroy them utterly, which, indeed, he himself did in\r\nthe eyes of the Jews, as Moses says, threatening them, moreover, that if\r\nthey did not obey his commands he would treat them as his open enemies;\r\nwhilst, on the other hand, his son, the man of Nazareth, promulgating laws\r\nin opposition to these, declares that no one comes to the Father who is\r\nrich or who loves power or seeks after wisdom or glory; that men ought to\r\nbe no more careful in providing food than the ravens: that they were to be\r\nin less concern about their raiment than the lilies; that to him who has\r\nsmitten them once they should offer opportunity to smite again? Is it\r\nMoses or Jesus who lies? Did the Father when he sent Jesus forget the\r\nthings he commanded Moses? Or did he change his mind and, condemning his\r\nown laws, send forth a messenger with the opposite instructions?”\r\n\r\nV, 14. (MSG, 11:1201.) “It is folly for them to suppose that when God, as\r\nif he were a cook, introduces the fire, all the rest of the human race\r\nwill be burnt up, while they alone will remain, not only those who are\r\nalive, but also those who have been dead long since, which latter will\r\narise from the earth clothed with the self-same flesh as during life; the\r\nhope, to speak plainly, of worms. For what sort of human soul is it that\r\nwould still long for a body gone to corruption? For this reason, also,\r\nthis opinion of yours is not shared by some of the Christians,(31) and\r\nthey pronounce it exceedingly vile and loathsome and impossible; for what\r\nkind of body is that which, after being completely corrupted, can return\r\nto its original nature, and to that self-same first condition which it\r\nleft? Having nothing to reply, they betake themselves to a most absurd\r\nrefuge—that all things are possible to God. But God cannot do things which\r\nare disgraceful, nor does he wish things contrary to his nature; nor, if\r\nin accordance with your wickedness you desire something shameful, would\r\nGod be able to do it; nor must you believe at once that it will be done.\r\nFor God is the author, not of inordinate desires nor of a nature\r\ndisordered and confused, but of what is upright and just. For the soul,\r\nindeed, he might be able to provide everlasting life; but dead bodies, on\r\nthe other hand, are, as Heraclitus observes, more worthless than dung. So,\r\nthen, God neither will nor can declare contrary to reason that the flesh\r\nis eternal, which is full of those things which it is not honorable to\r\nmention. For he is the reason of all things that exist, and therefore can\r\ndo nothing either contrary to reason or contrary to himself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Lucian of Samosata, _De morte Peregrini Protei_, § 11 _ff._\r\nPreuschen, _Analecta_, I, 20 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 11. About this time he made himself proficient in the marvellous\r\nwisdom of the Christians by associating around Palestine with their\r\npriests and scribes. And would you believe it? In a short time he\r\nconvinced them that they were mere children and himself alone a prophet,\r\nmaster of ceremonies, head of the synagogue, and everything. He explained\r\nand interpreted some of their books, and he himself also wrote many, so\r\nthey came to look upon him almost as a God, made him their law-giver and\r\nchose him as their patron.… At all events, they still worship that\r\nenchanter [mage] who was crucified in Palestine for introducing among men\r\nthis new religious sect.\r\n\r\nCh. 12. Then Proteus was, on this account, seized and thrown into prison,\r\nand this very circumstance procured for him during his subsequent career\r\nno small renown and the reputation for wonderful powers and the glory\r\nwhich he loved. When, then, he had been put in bonds, the Christians\r\nlooked upon these things as a misfortune and in their efforts to secure\r\nhis release did everything in their power. When this proved impracticable,\r\nother assistance of every sort was rendered him, not occasionally, but\r\nwith zeal. From earliest dawn old women, widows, and orphan children were\r\nto be seen waiting beside the prison, and men of rank among them slept\r\nwith him in the prison, having bribed the prison guards. Then they were\r\naccustomed to bring in all kinds of viands, and they read their sacred\r\nScriptures together, and the most excellent Peregrinus (for such was still\r\nhis name) was styled by them a New Socrates.\r\n\r\nCh. 13. Certain came even from the cities of Asia, sent by the Christians\r\nat the common charge, to assist and plead for him and comfort him. They\r\nexhibit extraordinary activity whenever any such thing occurs affecting\r\ntheir common interest. In short, they are lavish of everything. And what\r\nis more, on the pretext of his imprisonment, many contributions of money\r\ncame from them to Peregrinus at that time, and he made no little income\r\nout of it. These poor men have persuaded themselves that they are going to\r\nbe immortal and live forever; they both despise death and voluntarily\r\ndevote themselves to it; at least most of them do so. Moreover, their\r\nlaw-giver persuaded them that they were all brethren, and that when once\r\nthey come out and reject the Greek gods, they should then worship that\r\ncrucified sophist and live according to his laws. Therefore they despise\r\nall things and hold everything in common, having received such ideas from\r\nothers, without any sufficient basis for their faith. If, then, any\r\nimpostor or trickster who knows how to manage things came among them, he\r\nsoon grew rich, imposing on these foolish folk.\r\n\r\nCh. 14. Peregrinus was, however, set at liberty by the governor of Syria\r\nat that time, a lover of philosophy, who understood his folly and knew\r\nthat he would willingly have suffered death that by it he might have\r\nacquired glory. Thinking him, however, not worthy of so honorable an end,\r\nhe let him go.…\r\n\r\nCh. 16. A second time he left his country to wander about, having the\r\nChristians as a sufficient source of supplies, and he was cared for by\r\nthem most ungrudgingly. Thus he was supported for some time; at length,\r\nhaving offended them in some way—he was seen, I believe, eating food\r\nforbidden among them—he was reduced to want, and he thought that he would\r\nhave to demand his property back from the city;(32) and having obtained a\r\nprocess in the name of the Emperor, he expected to recover it. But the\r\ncity sent messengers to him, and nothing was done; but he was to remain\r\nwhere he was, and to this he agreed for once.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Minucius Felix, _Octavius_, VIII, 3-10. (MSL. 3:267 _ff._)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following passage is taken from an apologetic dialogue\r\n    entitled _Octavius_. Although it was composed by a Christian, it\r\n    probably represents the current heathen conceptions of\r\n    Christianity and its morals, especially its assemblies, where the\r\n    worst excesses were supposed to take place. In the dialogue the\r\n    passage is put into the mouth of the disputant who represents the\r\n    heathen objection to the new faith. The date is difficult to\r\n    determine probably it was the last third of the second century.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 8. … Is it not lamentable that men of a reprobate, unlawful, and\r\ndangerous faction should rage against the gods? From the lowest dregs, the\r\nmore ignorant and women, credulous and yielding on account of the\r\nheedlessness of their sex, gathered and established a vast and wicked\r\nconspiracy, bound together by nightly meetings and solemn feasts and\r\ninhuman meats—not by any sacred rites, but by such as require expiation.\r\nIt is a people skulking and shunning the light; in public silent, but in\r\ncorners loquacious. They despise the temples as charnel-houses; they\r\nreject the gods; they deride sacred things. While they are wretched\r\nthemselves, if allowed they pity the priests; while they are half naked\r\nthemselves, they despise honors and purple robes. O wonderful folly and\r\nincredible effrontery! They despise present torments, but fear those that\r\nare uncertain and in the future. While they fear to die after death, for\r\nthe present life they do not fear to die. In such manner does a deceitful\r\nhope soothe their fear with the solace of resuscitation.\r\n\r\nCh. 9. And now, as wickeder things are advancing more successfully and\r\nabandoned manners are creeping on day by day, those foul shrines of an\r\nimpious assembly are increasing throughout the whole world. Assuredly this\r\nconfederacy should be rooted out and execrated. They know one another by\r\nsecret marks and signs. They love one another almost before they know one\r\nanother. Everywhere, also, there is mingled among them a certain religion\r\nof lust; and promiscuously they call one another brother and sister, so\r\nthat even a not unusual debauchery might, by the employment of those\r\nsacred names, become incestuous. It is thus that their vain and insane\r\nsuperstition glories in crimes. Nor, concerning these matters, would\r\nintelligent report speak of things unless there was the highest degree of\r\ntruth, and varied crimes of the worst character called, from a sense of\r\ndecency, for an apology. I hear that they adore the head of an ass, that\r\nbasest of creatures, consecrated by I know not what silly persuasion—a\r\nworthy and appropriate religion for such morals. Some say that they\r\nworship the genitalia of their pontiff and priest, and adore the nature,\r\nas it were, of their parent. I know not whether these things be false;\r\ncertainly suspicion has place in the case of secret and nocturnal rites;\r\nand he who explains their ceremonies by reference to a man punished by\r\nextreme suffering for wickedness, and to the deadly wood of the cross,\r\nbestows fitting altars upon reprobate and wicked men, that they may\r\nworship what they deserve. Now the story of their initiation of young\r\nnovices is as detestable as it is well known. An infant covered with meal,\r\nso as to deceive the unwary, is placed before him who is to be defiled\r\nwith their rites; this infant is slain with dark and secret wounds by the\r\nyoung novice, who has been induced to strike harmless blows, as it were,\r\non the surface of the meal. Thirstily—O horror!—they lick up its blood;\r\neagerly they divide its limbs. By this victim they are confederated, with\r\nthe consciousness of this wickedness they are pledged to a mutual silence.\r\nThese sacred rites are more foul than any sort of sacrilege. And of their\r\nbanqueting it is well known what is said everywhere; even the speech of\r\nour Cirtensian(33) testifies to it. On a solemn day they assemble at a\r\nbanquet with all their children, their sisters and mothers, people of\r\nevery sex and age. There, after much feasting, when the sense of\r\nfellowship has waxed warm and the fervor of incestuous lust has grown hot\r\nwith drunkenness, a dog that has been tied to a chandelier is provoked to\r\nrush and spring about by throwing a piece of offal beyond the length of\r\nthe line by which he is bound; and thus the light, as if conscious, is\r\noverturned and extinguished in shameless darkness, while unions of\r\nabominable lust involve them by the uncertainty of chance. Although if all\r\nare not in fact, yet all are in their conscience, equally incestuous;\r\nsince whatever might happen by the act of the individuals is sought for by\r\nthe will of all.\r\n\r\nCh. 10. I purposely pass over many things, for there are too many, all of\r\nwhich, or the greater part of them, the obscurity of their vile religion\r\ndeclares to be true. For why do they endeavor with such pains to conceal\r\nand cloak whatever they worship, since honorable things always rejoice in\r\npublicity, but crimes are kept secret? Why have they no altars, no\r\ntemples, no acknowledged images? Why do they never speak openly, never\r\ncongregate freely, unless it be for the reason that what they adore and\r\nconceal is either worthy of punishment or is something to be ashamed of?\r\nMoreover, whence or who is he, or where is the one God, solitary and\r\ndesolate, whom no free people, no kingdoms, and not even Roman\r\nsuperstition have known? The sole, miserable nationality of the Jews\r\nworshipped one God, and one peculiar to itself; but they worshipped him\r\nopenly, with temples, with altars, with victims, and with ceremonies; and\r\nhe has so little force or power that he is enslaved together with his own\r\nspecial nation to the Roman deities. But the Christians, moreover, what\r\nwonders, what monstrosities, do they feign, that he who is their God, whom\r\nthey can neither show nor see, inquires diligently into the conduct of\r\nall, the acts of all, and even into their words and secret thoughts. They\r\nwould have him running about everywhere, and everywhere present,\r\ntroublesome, even shamelessly inquisitive, since he is present at\r\neverything that is done, and wanders about in all places. When he is\r\noccupied with the whole, he cannot give attention to particulars; or when\r\noccupied with particulars, he is not enough for the whole. Is it because\r\nthey threaten the whole earth, the world itself and all its stars, with a\r\nconflagration, that they are meditating its destruction? As if either the\r\nnatural and eternal order constituted by the divine laws would be\r\ndisturbed, or, when the league of the elements has been broken up and the\r\nheavenly structure dissolved, that fabric in which it is contained and\r\nbound together would be overthrown!\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 19. The Attitude of the Roman Government toward Christians, A. D. 138 to\r\nA. D. 192\r\n\r\n\r\nNo general persecution of the Christians was undertaken by the Roman\r\nGovernment during the second century, though Christians were not\r\ninfrequently put to death under the existing laws. These laws, however,\r\nwere by no means uniformly carried out. The most sanguinary persecutions\r\nwere generally occasioned by mob violence and may be compared to modern\r\nlynchings. At Lyons and Vienne, in Gaul, there was much suffering in 177.\r\nThe letter from the churches of these cities to the Christians in Asia and\r\nPhrygia, Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 1 (PNF, ser. I, vol. I, 211), and the\r\n_Martyrdom of Polycarp_ (ANF, I, 37) are among the finest pieces of\r\nliterature in this period and should be read by every student. Under\r\nCommodus (180-193), Marcia seems to have aided the Christians suffering\r\npersecution. The _Martyrdom of Justin_ may be found ANF, I, 303, appended\r\nto his works. The doubtful rescript of Hadrian and the certainly spurious\r\nrescript of Antoninus Pius may be found in the Appendix to Justin Martyr’s\r\nworks (ANF, I, 186), and in Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, IV, 9 and 13. For a\r\ndiscussion of their genuineness, see McGiffert’s notes to Eusebius, _Hist.\r\nEc._ The original texts may be found in Preuschen’s _Analecta_, I, § 6\r\n_f_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Justin Martyr, _Apologia_. II. 2. (MSG, 6:445.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The martyrdom of Ptolemæus.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A certain woman had been converted to Christianity by Ptolemæus.\r\n    Her dissolute husband, who had deserted her some time before, was\r\n    divorced by her on account of his profligacy. In revenge he\r\n    attempted to injure her, but she sought and obtained the\r\n    protection of the imperial courts. The husband thereupon turned\r\n    his attack upon Ptolemæus. According to Ruinart, the martyrdom\r\n    took place in 166. See DCB, arts. “Ptolemæus” and “Justin Martyr.”\r\n    This and the following martyrdoms illustrate the procedure of the\r\n    courts in dealing with Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince he was no longer able to prosecute her, he directed his assaults\r\nagainst a certain Ptolemæus whom Urbicus punished, and who had been the\r\nteacher of the woman in the Christian doctrines. And he did this in the\r\nfollowing way: He persuaded a centurion, his friend, who had cast\r\nPtolemæus into prison, to take Ptolemæus and interrogate him only as to\r\nwhether he were a Christian. And Ptolemæus, being a lover of the truth,\r\nand not of deceitful or false disposition, when he confessed himself to be\r\na Christian, was thrown in chains by the centurion and for a long time was\r\npunished in prison. At last, when he was brought to Urbicus, he was asked\r\nthis one question only: whether he was a Christian. And again, conscious\r\nof the noble things that were his through the teaching of Christ, he\r\nconfessed his discipleship in the divine virtue. For he who denies\r\nanything either denies it because he condemns the thing itself or he\r\navoids confession because he knows his own unworthiness or alienation from\r\nit; neither of which cases is that of a true Christian. And when Urbicus\r\nordered him to be led away to punishment, a certain Lucius, who was also\r\nhimself a Christian, seeing the unreasonable judgment, said to Urbicus:\r\n“What is the ground of this judgment? Why have you punished this man: not\r\nas an adulterer, nor fornicator, nor as one guilty of murder, theft, or\r\nrobbery, nor convicted of any crime at all, but who has only confessed\r\nthat he is called by the name of Christian? You do not judge, O Urbicus,\r\nas becomes the Emperor Pius, nor the philosopher, the son of Cæsar, nor\r\nthe sacred Senate.” And he, replying nothing else to Lucius, said: “You\r\nalso seem to me to be such an one.” And when Lucius answered, “Most\r\ncertainly I am,” he then ordered him also to be led away. And he professed\r\nhis thanks, since he knew that he was going to be delivered from such\r\nwicked rulers and was going to the Father and King of the heavens. And\r\nstill a third came forward and was condemned to be punished.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Passion of the Scilitan Martyrs._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Text: J. A. Robinson, _Text and Studies_, I, 2, 112-116,\r\n    Cambridge, 1891; reprinted in R. Knopf, _Ausgewählte\r\n    Märtyreracten_, 34 _ff._, Tübingen, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The date of this martyrdom is July 17, 180 A.D. Scili, the place\r\n    of residence of these martyrs, was a small city in northwestern\r\n    Proconsular Africa. For an account of ancient martyrologies, see\r\n    Krüger, §§ 104 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Præsens, for the second time, and Claudianus were consuls, on the\r\nseventeenth day of July, and when Speratus, Nartzalus, Cittinus, Donata,\r\nSecunda, and Vestia were brought into the judgment-hall at Carthage, the\r\nproconsul Saturninus said: Ye can win the indulgence of our lord the\r\nEmperor if ye return to a sound mind.\r\n\r\nSperatus said: We have never done ill; we have not lent ourselves to\r\nwrong; we have never spoken ill; but when we have received ill we have\r\ngiven thanks, because we pay heed to our Emperor.\r\n\r\nSaturninus, the proconsul, said: We, too, are religious, and our religion\r\nis simple; and we swear by the genius of our lord the Emperor, and pray\r\nfor his welfare, which also ye, too, ought to do.\r\n\r\nSperatus said: If thou wilt peaceably lend me thine ears, I will tell thee\r\nthe mystery of simplicity.\r\n\r\nSaturninus said: I will not lend my ears to thee, when thou beginnest to\r\nspeak evil things of our sacred rites; but rather do thou swear by the\r\ngenius of our lord the Emperor.\r\n\r\nSperatus said: The empire of this world I know not; but rather I serve\r\nthat God whom no man hath seen nor with these eyes can see. [I Tim. 6:16.]\r\nI have committed no theft; but if I have bought anything I pay the tax;\r\nbecause I know my Lord, the King of kings and Emperor of all nations.\r\n\r\nSaturninus, the proconsul, said to the rest: Cease to be of this\r\npersuasion.\r\n\r\nSperatus said: It is an ill persuasion to do murder, to bear false\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nSaturninus, the proconsul, said: Be not partakers of this folly.\r\n\r\nCittinus said: We have none other to fear except only our Lord God, who is\r\nin heaven.\r\n\r\nDonata said: Honor to Cæsar as Cæsar, but fear to God. [_Cf._ Rom. 13:7.]\r\n\r\nVestia said: I am a Christian.\r\n\r\nSecunda said: What I am that I wish to be.\r\n\r\nSaturninus, the proconsul, said to Speratus: Dost thou persist in being a\r\nChristian?\r\n\r\nSperatus said: I am a Christian. And with him they all agreed.\r\n\r\nSaturninus, the proconsul, said: Will ye have a space to consider?\r\n\r\nSperatus said: In a matter so just there is no considering.\r\n\r\nSaturninus, the proconsul, said: What are the things in your chest?\r\n\r\nSperatus said: Books and epistles of Paul, a just man.\r\n\r\nSaturninus, the proconsul, said: Have a delay of thirty days and bethink\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\nSperatus said a second time: I am a Christian. And with him all agreed.\r\n\r\nSaturninus, the proconsul, read out the decree from the tablet: Speratus,\r\nNartzalus, Cittinus, Donata, Vestia, Secunda, and the rest who have\r\nconfessed that they live according to the Christian rite because an\r\nopportunity has been offered them of returning to the custom of the Romans\r\nand they have obstinately persisted, it is determined shall be put to the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nSperatus said: We give thanks to God.\r\n\r\nNartzalus said: To-day we are martyrs in heaven; thanks be to God.\r\n\r\nSaturninus, the proconsul, ordered it to be proclaimed by the herald:\r\nSperatus, Nartzalus, Cittinus, Veturius, Felix, Aquilinus, Lætatius,\r\nJanuaria, Generosa, Vestia, Donata, and Secunda I have ordered to be\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nThey all said: Thanks be to God.\r\n\r\nAnd so they all at one time were crowned with martyrdom; and they reign\r\nwith the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, forever and ever. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Hippolytus, _Refutatio omnium Hæresium_, X, 7. (MSG, 16:3382.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hippolytus, a Greek writer of the West, lived at Rome in the time\r\n    of Zephyrinus (198-217) and until shortly after A. D. 235. He\r\n    appears to have been consecrated bishop of a schismatical party in\r\n    Rome. Of his numerous works many have been lost in whole or in\r\n    part. The _Philosophumena, or the Refutation of All Heresies_, was\r\n    lost, with the exception of the first book, until 1842, and was\r\n    then published among the works of Origen. It is of importance as\r\n    giving much material for the study of Gnosticism. It may be found\r\n    as a whole translated in ANF, V.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut after a time, when other martyrs were there [_i.e._, in the mines in\r\nSardinia], Marcia, the pious concubine of Commodus, wishing to perform\r\nsome good deed, called before her the blessed Victor [193?-202], at that\r\ntime bishop of the Church, and inquired of him what martyrs were in\r\nSardinia. And he delivered to her the names of all, but did not give the\r\nname of Callistus, knowing what things had been attempted by him. Marcia,\r\nhaving obtained her request from Commodus, hands the letter of\r\nemancipation to Hyacinthus, a certain eunuch rather advanced in life [or a\r\npresbyter], who, receiving it, sailed away to Sardinia. He delivered the\r\nletter to the person who at that time was governor of the territory, and\r\nhe released the martyrs, with the exception of Callistus.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 20. The Literary Defence of Christianity\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reply to the attacks made upon Christianity, the apologists defended\r\ntheir religion along three lines: It was philosophically justified; it was\r\ntrue; it did not favor immorality, but, on the contrary, inculcated\r\nvirtue. The philosophical defence, or justification, of Christianity was\r\nmost brilliantly undertaken by Justin Martyr, who employed the current\r\nphilosophical conception of the Logos. The general proof of Christianity\r\nwas chiefly based upon the argument from the fulfilment of prophecy. All\r\napologists undertook to show that the heathen calumnies against the\r\nChristians were false, that the heathen religions were replete with\r\nobscene tales of the gods, and that the worship of idols was absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Aristides, _Apology_, 2, 13, 15, 16. Ed. J. R. Harris and J. A.\r\nRobinson, _Texts and Studies_, I, 1, Cambridge, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Apology_ of Aristides was long lost, but was found in a\r\n    Syriac version in 1889. It was then found that much of the Greek\r\n    original had been incorporated in the _Life of Barlaam and\r\n    Josaphat_, a popular religious romance of the Middle Ages; see the\r\n    introduction to the parallel translations by D. H. McKay in ANF,\r\n    vol. IX, 259-279. This work of Aristides may be as early as 125;\r\n    if so, it disputes with the similar work of Quadratus the honor of\r\n    being the first Christian apology. A large part of it is taken up\r\n    with a statement of the contradictions and absurdities of the\r\n    mythology of the Greeks and Barbarians. Of this statement, ch. 13,\r\n    quoted below, is the conclusion. Then, after a short passage\r\n    regarding the Jews, the author passes to an exposition of the\r\n    faith of Christians and a statement regarding their high morality.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 2. [Found only in Syriac.] The Christians trace the beginning of their\r\nreligion to Jesus the Messiah; and He is named the Son of the most high\r\nGod. And it is said that God came down from heaven and from a Hebrew\r\nvirgin assumed and clothed Himself with flesh, and that the Son of God\r\nlived in a daughter of man. This is taught in that Gospel which, as is\r\nrelated among them, was preached among them a short time ago. And you,\r\nalso, if you will read therein, may perceive the power that belongs to it.\r\nThis Jesus, therefore, was born of the race of the Hebrews. He had twelve\r\ndisciples, that His wonderful plan of salvation might be carried out. But\r\nHe himself was pierced by the Jews, and He died and He was buried. And\r\nthey say that after three days He rose and was raised to heaven. Thereupon\r\nthose twelve disciples went forth into the known parts of the world, and\r\nwith all modesty and uprightness taught concerning His greatness. And\r\ntherefore also those at the present time who now believe that preaching\r\nare called Christians and they are known.\r\n\r\nCh. 13. When the Greeks made laws they did not perceive that by their laws\r\nthey condemned their gods. For if their laws are righteous, their gods are\r\nunrighteous, because they committed transgressions of the law in that they\r\nkilled one another, practised sorcery, and committed adultery, robbed,\r\nstole, and lay with males, not to mention their other practices. For if\r\ntheir gods have done right in doing all this, as they write, then the laws\r\nof the Greeks are unrighteous in not being made according to the will of\r\ntheir gods. And consequently the whole world has gone astray.\r\n\r\nCh. 15. The Christians, O King, in that they go about and seek the truth,\r\nhave found it and, as we have understood from their writings, they have\r\ncome much nearer to the truth and correct knowledge than have the other\r\npeoples. They know and trust God, the creator of heaven and earth, in whom\r\nare all things and from whom are all things, in Him who has no other God\r\nbeside Him, in Him from whom they have received commandments which they\r\nhave engraved upon their minds, commandments which they observe in the\r\nfaith and expectation of the world to come. Wherefore they do not commit\r\nadultery or fornication, nor bear false witness, nor covet what is held in\r\npledge, nor covet what is not theirs. They honor father and mother and\r\nshow kindness to their neighbors. If they are judges, they judge\r\nuprightly. They do not worship idols made in human form. And whatsoever\r\nthey would not that others should do unto them, they do not to others.\r\nThey do not eat of food offered to idols, because they are pure. And their\r\noppressors they appease and they make friends of them; they do good to\r\ntheir enemies.… If they see a stranger, they take him to their dwellings\r\nand rejoice over him as over a real brother. For they do not call\r\nthemselves brethren after the flesh, but after the Spirit and in God. But\r\nif one of their poor passes from the world, each one of them who sees him\r\ncares for his burial according to his ability. And if they hear that one\r\nof them is imprisoned or oppressed on account of the name of their\r\nMessiah, all of them care for his necessity, and if it is possible to\r\nredeem him, they set him free. And if any one among them is poor and\r\nneedy, and they have no spare food, they fast two or three days in order\r\nto supply him with the needed food.(34) The precepts of their Messiah they\r\nobserve with great care. They live justly and soberly, as the Lord their\r\nGod commanded them. Every morning and every hour they acknowledge and\r\npraise God for His lovingkindnesses toward them, and for their food and\r\ndrink they give thanks to Him. And if any righteous man among them passes\r\nfrom this world, they rejoice and thank God and they escort his body as if\r\nhe were setting out on a journey from one place to another.…\r\n\r\nCh. 16. … Their words and precepts, O King, and the glory of their worship\r\nand their hope of receiving reward, which they look for in another world,\r\naccording to the work of each one, you can learn about from their\r\nwritings. It is enough for us to have informed your Majesty in a few words\r\nconcerning the conduct and truth of the Christians. For great, indeed, and\r\nwonderful is their doctrine for him who will study it and reflect upon it.\r\nAnd verily this is a new people, and there is something divine in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Justin Martyr, _Apologia_, I, 46. (MSG, 6:398.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the following, Justin Martyr states his argument from the\r\n    doctrine of the Logos, which was widely accepted in Greek\r\n    philosophy and found its counterpart in Christianity in the\r\n    Johannine theology (see below, § 32 _A_). With Justin should be\r\n    compared Clement of Alexandria (see below, § 43 _a_), who develops\r\n    the same idea in showing the relation of Greek philosophy to the\r\n    Mosaic dispensation and to the Christian revelation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been taught that Christ is the first-born of God, and we have\r\ndeclared above that He is the Word of whom every race of men partake; and\r\nthose who lived reasonably were Christians, even though they have been\r\nthought atheists; as among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus and those\r\nlike them; and among the Barbarians, Abraham and Ananias, and Azarias, and\r\nMisael, and Elias, and many others whose actions and names we now decline\r\nto recount, because we know it would be tedious.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Justin Martyr, _Apologia_, II, 10, 13. (MSG, 6:459, 466.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 10. Our doctrines, then, appear to be greater than all human teaching;\r\nbecause Christ who appeared for our sakes, became the whole rational\r\nbeing,(35) body and reason and soul. For whatever either law-givers or\r\nphilosophers uttered well they elaborated by finding and contemplating\r\nsome part of the Logos. But since they did not know the whole of the\r\nLogos, which is Christ, they often contradicted themselves. And those who\r\nby human birth were more ancient than Christ, when they attempted to\r\nconsider and prove things by reason, were brought before the tribunals as\r\nimpious persons and busybodies. And Socrates, who was more zealous in this\r\ndirection than all of them, was accused of the very same crimes as\r\nourselves. For they said that he was introducing new divinities, and did\r\nnot consider those to be gods whom the State recognized. But he cast out\r\nfrom the State both Homer and the rest of the poets, and taught men to\r\nreject the wicked demons and those who did the things which the poets\r\nrelated; and he exhorted them to become acquainted with the God who was\r\nunknown to them, by means of the investigation of reason, saying, “That it\r\nis not easy to find the Father and Maker of all, nor, having found Him, is\r\nit safe to declare Him to all.”(36) But these things our Christ did\r\nthrough His own power. For no one trusted in Socrates so as to die for\r\nthis doctrine, but in Christ, who was partially known even by Socrates\r\n(for He was and is the Logos who is in every man, and who foretold the\r\nthings that were to come to pass both through the prophets and in His own\r\nperson when He was made of like passions and taught these things), not\r\nonly philosophers and scholars believed, but also artisans and people\r\nentirely uneducated, despising both glory and fear and death; since He is\r\nthe power of the ineffable Father, and not the mere instrument of human\r\nreason.(37)\r\n\r\nCh. 13. … I confess that I both boast and with all my strength strive to\r\nbe found a Christian; not because the teachings of Plato are different\r\nfrom those of Christ, but because they are not in all respects similar, as\r\nneither are those of others, Stoics, poets, and historians. For each man\r\nspoke well in proportion to the share he had of the spermatic divine\r\nLogos, seeing what was related to it. But they who contradict themselves\r\non the more important points appear not to have possessed the heavenly\r\nwisdom and the knowledge which cannot be spoken against. Whatever things\r\nwere rightly said among all men are the property of us Christians. For\r\nnext to God we worship and love the Logos, who is from the unbegotten and\r\nineffable God, since also He became man for our sakes, that, becoming a\r\npartaker of our sufferings, He might also bring us healing. For all the\r\nwriters were able to see realities darkly through the sowing of the\r\nimplanted Logos that was in them. For the seed of anything and a copy\r\nimparted according to capacity [_i.e._, to receive] is one thing, and\r\nquite another is the thing itself, of which there is the participation and\r\nimitation according to the grace which is from Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Justin Martyr, _Apologia_, I, 31, 53. (MSG, 6:375, 406.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The argument from prophecy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 31. There were then among the Jews certain men who were prophets of\r\nGod, through whom the prophetic Spirit [context shows that the Logos is\r\nhere meant] published beforehand things that were to come to pass before\r\nthey happened. And their prophecies, as they were spoken and when they\r\nwere uttered, the kings who were among the Jews at the several times\r\ncarefully preserved in their possession, when they had been arranged by\r\nthe prophets themselves in their own Hebrew language.… They are also in\r\npossession of all Jews throughout the world.… In these books of the\r\nprophets we found Jesus our Christ foretold as coming, born of a virgin,\r\ngrowing up to manhood, and healing every disease and every sickness, and\r\nraising the dead, and being hated and unrecognized, and crucified, and\r\ndying, and rising again, and ascending into heaven, and both being and\r\nalso called the Son of God, and that certain persons should be sent by Him\r\ninto every race of men to publish these things, and that rather among the\r\nGentiles [than among the Jews] men should believe on Him. And He was\r\npredicted before He appeared first 5,000 years before, and again 3,000,\r\nthen 2,000 then 1,000, and yet again 800; for according to the succession\r\nof generations prophets after prophets arose.\r\n\r\nCh. 53. Though we have many other prophecies, we forbear to speak, judging\r\nthese sufficient for the persuasion of those who have ears capable of\r\nhearing and understanding; and considering also that these persons are\r\nable to see that we do not make assertions, and are unable to produce\r\nproof, like those fables that are told of the reputed sons of Jupiter. For\r\nwith what reason should we believe of a crucified man that He is the\r\nfirst-born of the unbegotten God, and Himself will pass judgment on the\r\nwhole human race, unless we found testimonies concerning Him published\r\nbefore He came and was born as a man, and unless we saw that things had\r\nhappened accordingly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. The Internal Crisis: The Gnostic And Other Heretical Sects\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second century the Church passed through an internal crisis even\r\nmore trying than the great persecutions of the following centuries and\r\nwith results far more momentous. Of the conditions making possible such a\r\ncrisis the most important was absence in the Church of norms of faith\r\nuniversally acknowledged as binding. Then, again, many had embraced\r\nChristianity without grasping the spirit of the new religion. Nearly all\r\ninterpreted the Christian faith more or less according to their earlier\r\nphilosophical or religious conceptions; _e.g._, the apologists within the\r\nChurch used the philosophical Logos doctrine. In this way arose numerous\r\ninterpretations of Christian teaching and perversions of that teaching,\r\nsome not at all in harmony with the generally received tradition. These\r\ndiscordant interpretations or perversions are the heretical movements of\r\nthe second century. They varied in every degree of departure from the\r\ngenerally accepted Christian tradition. Some, like the earlier Gnostics (§\r\n21), and even the greater Gnostic systems (§ 22), at least in their\r\nesoteric teaching, show that their principal inspiration was other than\r\nChristian; others, as the Gnosticism of Marcion (§ 23) and the\r\nenthusiastic sect of the Montanists (§ 25), seem to have built largely\r\nupon exaggerated Christian tenets, contained, indeed, in the New\r\nTestament, but not fully appreciated by the majority of Christians; or\r\nstill others, as the Encratites (§ 24), laid undue stress upon what was\r\ngenerally recognized as an element of Christian morality.\r\n\r\nThe principal source materials for the history of Gnosticism and other\r\nheresies of this chapter may be found collected and provided with\r\ncommentary in Hilgenfeld, _Ketzergeschichte des Urchristenthums_, Leipsic,\r\n1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 21. The Earlier Gnostics: Gnosticism in General\r\n\r\n\r\nGnosticism is a generic name for a vast number of syncretistic religious\r\nsystems prevalent, especially in the East, both before and after the\r\nChristian era. For the most part the movement was outside of Christianity,\r\nand was already dying out when Christianity appeared. It derived its\r\nessential features from Persian and Babylonian sources and was markedly\r\ndualistic. As it spread toward the West, it adopted many Western elements,\r\nmaking use of Christian ideas and terms and Greek philosophical concepts.\r\nModified by such new matter, it obtained a renewed lease of life. In\r\nproportion as the various schools of Gnosticism became more influenced by\r\nChristian elements, they were more easily confused with Christianity, and\r\naccordingly more dangerous to it. Among such were the greater schools of\r\nBasilides and Valentinus (see next section). The doctrines of Gnosticism\r\nwere held by many who were nominally within the Church. The tendency of\r\nthe Gnostics and their adherents was to form little coteries and to keep\r\nmuch of their teaching secret from those who were attracted by their more\r\npopular tenets. The esoteric element seems to have been the so-called\r\n“systems” in which the fanciful and mythological element in Gnosticism\r\nappears. This, as being the most vulnerable part of the Gnostic teaching,\r\nwas attacked most bitterly by the opponents of heresy. There are no extant\r\nwritings of the earlier Gnostics, Simon, Menander, or Cerinthus. They are\r\nknown only from Christian opponents.\r\n\r\nSources for the history of Gnosticism: The leading sources are the Church\r\nFathers Irenæus, Hippolytus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria (all\r\ntranslated in ANF), Origen (in part only translated in ANF), and\r\nEpiphanius. The accounts of these bitter enemies must necessarily be used\r\nwith caution. They contain, however, numerous fragments from Gnostic\r\nwritings. The fragments in the ante-Nicene Fathers may be found in A.\r\nHilgenfeld, _op. cit._, in Greek, with commentary. For the literary\r\nremains of Gnosticism, see Krüger, §§ 22-31. The more accessible are:\r\n_Acts of Thomas_ (best Greek text by Bonnet, Leipsic, 1903, German\r\ntranslation with excellent commentary in E. Hennecke, _Neutestamentliche\r\nApokryphen_, Tübingen and Leipsic, 1904); Ptolemæus, _Epistle to Flora_\r\n(in Epiphanius, _Panarion_, Hær. XXXIII); _Hymn of the Soul_, from the\r\n_Acts of Thomas_ (text and English translation by Bevan in _Text and\r\nStudies_, V, 3, Cambridge, 1897, also translated in F. C. Burkitt, _Early\r\nEastern Christianity_, N. Y., 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Tertullian, _De Præscriptione Hæreticorum_, 7. (MSL, 2:21.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    A wide-spread opinion that Gnosticism was fundamentally a\r\n    perversion of Christianity finds its most striking expression in\r\n    the phrase of Harnack that it was “the acute secularizing or\r\n    Hellenizing of Christianity” (_History of Dogma_, English\r\n    translation, I, 226). The foundation for this representation is\r\n    the later Gnosticism, which took over many Christian and Greek\r\n    elements, and the opinion of Tertullian that Gnosticism and Greek\r\n    philosophy discussed the same questions and held the same\r\n    opinions. (_Cf._ the thesis of Hippolytus in his _Philosophumena,\r\n    or the Refutation of All Heresies_; see the Proemium, ANF, V, 9\r\n    _f._, and especially bk. VII.) Tertullian, although retaining\r\n    unconsciously the impress of his former Stoicism, was violently\r\n    opposed to philosophy, and in his denunciation of heresy felt that\r\n    it was a powerful argument against the Gnostics to show\r\n    similarities between their teaching and the Greek philosophy he so\r\n    heartily detested. It is a brilliant work and may be taken as a\r\n    fair specimen of Tertullian’s style.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the doctrines of men and of demons born of the spirit of this\r\nworld’s wisdom, for itching ears; and the Lord, calling this foolishness,\r\nchose the foolish things of this world to the confusion of philosophy\r\nitself. For philosophy is the material of the world’s wisdom, the rash\r\ninterpreter of the nature and dispensation of God. Indeed, heresies\r\nthemselves are instigated by philosophy. From this source came the eons,\r\nand I know not what infinite forms, and the trinity of man in the system\r\nof Valentinus; he was of Plato’s school. From this source came Marcion’s\r\nbetter god with all his tranquillity; he came of the Stoics. Then again\r\nthe opinion that the soul dies is held by the Epicureans. The denial of\r\nthe resurrection of the body is taken from the united schools of all\r\nphilosophers. When matter is made equal to God, you have the teaching of\r\nZeno; and when anything is alleged touching a fiery god, then Heraclitus\r\ncomes in. The same subject-matter is discussed over and over again by the\r\nheretics and the philosophers; the same arguments are involved. Whence and\r\nwherefore is evil? Whence and how has come man? Besides these there is the\r\nquestion which Valentinus has very recently proposed, Whence comes God?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, I, 23. (MSG, 7:670.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Simon Magus. For additional source material, see Justin Martyr,\r\n    _Apol._ I, 26, 56, _Dial. c. Tryph._, 120; Hippolytus, _Ref._ VI,\r\n    72 _f._ The appearance of Simon in the pseudo-Clementine\r\n    literature (translated in ANF, VIII), presents an interesting\r\n    historical problem. The present condition of investigation is\r\n    given in the article “Clementine Literature” by J. V. Bartlett, in\r\n    _Encyc. Brit._, eleventh ed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimon the Samaritan, that magician of whom Luke, the disciple and follower\r\nof the Apostles, says: “But there was a certain man, Simon by name,” etc.\r\n[Acts 8:9-11, 20, 21, 23.] Since he did not put his faith in God a whit\r\nmore, he set himself eagerly to contend against the Apostles, in order\r\nthat he himself might seem to be a wonderful being, and studied with still\r\ngreater zeal the whole range of magic art, that he might the better\r\nbewilder the multitude of men. Such was his procedure in the reign of\r\nClaudius Cæsar, by whom also he is said to have been honored with a statue\r\non account of his magic. This man, then, was glorified by many as a god,\r\nand he taught that it was he himself who appeared among the Jews as the\r\nSon, but descended in Samaria as the Father, while he came to other\r\nnations in the character of the Holy Spirit. He represented himself as the\r\nloftiest of all powers, that it is he who is over all as the Father, and\r\nhe allowed himself to be called whatsoever men might name him.\r\n\r\nNow this Simon of Samaria, from whom all heresies derive their origin, has\r\nas the material for his sect the following: Having redeemed from slavery\r\nat Tyre, a city of Phœnicia, a certain woman named Helena,(38) a\r\nprostitute, he was in the habit of carrying her about with him, declaring\r\nthat she was the first conception [_Ennœa_] of his mind, the mother of\r\nall, by whom he conceived in his mind to make the angels and archangels.\r\nFor this Ennœa, leaping forth from him and comprehending the will of her\r\nfather, descended to the lower regions and generated angels and powers, by\r\nwhom, also, he declared this world was made. But after she had generated\r\nthem she was detained by them through jealousy, because they were\r\nunwilling that they should be regarded as the progeny of any other being.\r\nAs to himself, he was wholly unknown to them, but his Ennœa was detained\r\nby those powers and angels who had been produced by her. She suffered all\r\nkinds of contumely from them, so that she could not return upward to her\r\nfather, but was even shut up in a human body and for ages passed in\r\nsuccession from one female body to another, as from one vessel to another\r\nvessel. She was in that Helen on whose account the Trojan War was\r\nundertaken; wherefore also Stesichorus was struck blind, because he cursed\r\nher in his poems; but afterward, when he had repented and written those\r\nverses which are called palinodes, in which he sung her praises, he saw\r\nonce more. Thus passing from body to body and suffering insults in every\r\none of them, she at last became a common prostitute; and she it is who was\r\nthe lost sheep.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose he himself had come, that he might win her first and free\r\nher from chains, and confer salvation upon men by making himself known to\r\nthem. For since the angels ruled the world poorly, because each one of\r\nthem coveted the principal power, he had come to mend matters and had\r\ndescended, been transfigured and assimilated to powers and angels, so that\r\nhe might appear among men as man, although he was not a man; and that he\r\nwas supposed to have suffered in Judea, although he had not suffered.\r\nMoreover, the prophets inspired by the angels, who were the makers of the\r\nworld, pronounced their prophecies; for which reason those who place their\r\ntrust in him and Helena no longer regard them, but are free to do what\r\nthey will; for men are saved according to his grace, and not according to\r\ntheir righteous works. For deeds are not righteous in the nature of\r\nthings, but by mere accident and just as those angels who made the world\r\nhave determined, seeking by such precepts to bring men into bondage. On\r\nthis account he promised that the world should be dissolved and that those\r\nwho are his should be freed from the rule of them who made the world.\r\n\r\nThus, then, the mystic priests belonging to this sect both live\r\nprofligately and practise magical arts, each one to the extent of his\r\nability. They use exorcisms and incantations, love-potions, also, and\r\ncharms, as well as those beings who are called “familiars” [_paredri_] and\r\n\"dream senders\" [_oniropompi_], and whatever other curious arts can be had\r\nare eagerly pressed into their service.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, I, 23. (MSG, 7:673.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The system of Menander. _Cf._ also Eusebius. _Hist. Ec._, III, 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe successor of Simon Magus was Menander, a Samaritan by birth, who also\r\nbecame a perfect adept in magic. He affirms that the first power is\r\nunknown to all, but that he himself is the person who has been sent forth\r\nby the invisible beings as a saviour for the salvation of men. The world\r\nwas made by angels, who, as he also, like Simon, says, were produced by\r\nthe Ennœa, He gives also, as he affirms, by means of the magic which he\r\nteaches knowledge, so that one may overcome those angels that made the\r\nworld. For his disciples obtain the resurrection by the fact that they are\r\nbaptized into him, and they can die no more, but remain immortal without\r\never growing old.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, I, 26. (MSG, 7:686.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The system of Cerinthus. For additional source material, see\r\n    Irenæus, III, 3, 4; Hippolytus, _Ref._ VII, 33; X, 21; Eusebius,\r\n    _Hist. Ec._, III, 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nCerinthus, again, taught in Asia that the world was not made by the\r\nsupreme God, but by a power separated and distant from that Ruler\r\n[_principalitate_] who is over the universe, and ignorant of the God who\r\nis above all. He represented Jesus as not having been born of a virgin,\r\nfor this seemed impossible to him, but as having been the son of Joseph\r\nand Mary in the same way that all other men are sons, only he was more\r\nrighteous, prudent, and wise than other men. After his baptism Christ\r\ndescended upon him in the form of a dove from the Supreme Ruler; and that\r\nthen he proclaimed the unknown Father and performed miracles. But at last\r\nChrist departed from Jesus, and then Jesus suffered and rose again, but\r\nChrist remained impassable, since He was a spiritual being.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 22. The Greater Gnostic Systems: Basilides and Valentinus\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gnostic systems having most influence within the Church and effect\r\nupon its development were those of Basilides and Valentinus. Of these\r\nteachers and their followers we have not only the accounts of those\r\nopponents who attacked principally their esoteric and most\r\ncharacteristically Gnostic tenets, but also fragments and other remains\r\nwhich give a more favorable impression of the religious and moral value of\r\nthe great schools of Gnosticism. In their “systems” of vast theogonies and\r\ncosmologies, in their wild mythological treatment of the most abstract\r\nconceptions and their dualism, the Church writers naturally saw at once\r\ntheir most vulnerable and most dangerous element.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. The School of Basilides\r\n\r\n\r\nThe school of Basilides marks the beginning of the distinctively\r\nHellenistic stadium of Gnosticism. Basilides, its founder, apparently\r\nworked first in the East; circa 120-130 he was at Alexandria. He was the\r\nfirst important Gnostic writer. Of his Gospel, Commentary on that Gospel\r\nin twenty-four books (_Exegetica_), and his odes only fragments remain of\r\nthe second, preserved by Clement of Alexandria and in the _Acta Archelai_\r\n(collected by Hilgenfeld, _Ketzergeschichte_, 207-213).\r\n\r\nAdditional source material: Clement of Alexandria, _Strom._, II, 3, 8, 20;\r\nIV, 24, 26 (ANF. II); Hippolytus, _Ref._, VII, 20-27; X, 14 (=VII, 1-15,\r\nX, 10, ANF, V); Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, IV. 7. The account of Hippolytus\r\ndiffers markedly from that of Irenæus, and his quotations and references\r\nhave been the subject of long dispute among scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Acta Archelai_, 55. (MSG, 10:1526.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Acta Archelai_ purport to be an account of a disputation held\r\n    in the reign of the Emperor Probus (276-282) by Archelaus, Bishop\r\n    of Kaskar in Mesopotamia, with Mani, the founder of Manichæanism.\r\n    The work is of uncertain authorship; it belongs to the first part\r\n    of the fourth century. It is the most important source for the\r\n    Manichæan doctrine (_v. infra_, § 54). It exists only in a Latin\r\n    translation probably from a Greek original.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Persians there was also a certain preacher, one Basilides, of\r\nmore ancient date, not long after the time of our Apostles. Since he was\r\nof a shrewd disposition himself, and observed that at that time all other\r\nsubjects were preoccupied, he determined to affirm that dualism which was\r\nmaintained also by Scythianus. And so, since he had nothing to advance\r\nwhich he might call his own, he brought the sayings of others before his\r\nadversaries. And all his books contain some matters difficult and\r\nextremely harsh. The thirteenth book of his Tractates,(39) however, is\r\nstill extant, which begins thus: “In writing the thirteenth book of our\r\nTractates, the word of salvation furnished us with the necessary and\r\nfruitful word. It illustrates(40) under the figure of a rich [principle]\r\nand a poor [principle], a nature without root and without place and only\r\nsupervenes upon things.(41) This is the only topic which the book\r\ncontains.” Does it not, then, contain a strange word, as also certain\r\npersons think? Will ye not all be offended with the book itself, of which\r\nthis is the beginning? But Basilides, returning to the subject, some five\r\nhundred lines intervening, more or less, says: “Give up this vain and\r\ncurious variation, and let us rather find out what inquiries the\r\nBarbarians [_i.e._, the Persians] have instituted concerning good and\r\nevil, and to what opinions they have come on all these subjects. For\r\ncertain among them have said that there are for all things two beginnings\r\n[or principles], to which they have referred good and evil, holding these\r\nprinciples are without beginning and ingenerate; that is to say, that in\r\nthe origins of things there were light and darkness, which existed of\r\nthemselves, and which were not declared to exist.(42) When these subsisted\r\nby themselves, they each led its own proper mode of life as it willed to\r\nlead, and such as was competent to it. For in the case of all things, what\r\nis proper to it is in amity with it, and nothing seems evil to itself. But\r\nafter they came to the knowledge of each other, and after the darkness\r\ncontemplated the light, then, as if fired with a passion for something\r\nsuperior, the darkness rushed to have intercourse with the light.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Clement of Alexandria, _Strom._, IV, 12. (MSG, 8:1289.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Basilides taught the transmigration of souls as an explanation of\r\n    human suffering. _Cf._ Origen in _Ep. ad Rom._, V: “I [Paul], he\r\n    says, died [Rom. 7:9], for now sin began to be reckoned unto me.\r\n    But Basilides, not noticing that these things ought to be\r\n    understood of the natural law, according to impious and foolish\r\n    fables turns this apostolic saying into the Pythagorean dogma,\r\n    that is, attempts to prove from this word of the Apostle that\r\n    souls are transferred from one body to another. For he says that\r\n    the Apostle has said, ‘I lived without any law’—_i.e._, before I\r\n    came into the body I lived in that sort of body which is not under\r\n    the law, _i.e._, of beasts and birds.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBasilides, in the twenty-third book of the Exegetics, respecting those\r\nthat are punished by martyrdom, expresses himself in the following\r\nlanguage: “For I say this, Whosoever fall under the afflictions mentioned,\r\nin consequence of unconsciously transgressing in other matters, are\r\nbrought to this good end by the kindness of Him who brings about all\r\nthings, though they are accused on other grounds; so that they may not\r\nsuffer as condemned for what are acknowledged to be iniquities, nor\r\nreproached as the adulterer or the murderer, but because they are\r\nChristians; which will console them, so that they do not appear to suffer.\r\nAnd if one who has not sinned at all incur suffering (a rare case), yet\r\neven he will not suffer aught through the machinations of power, but will\r\nsuffer as the child which seems not to have sinned would suffer.” Then\r\nfurther on he adds: “As, then, the child which has not sinned before, nor\r\nactually committed sin, but has in itself that which committed sin, when\r\nsubjected to suffering is benefited, reaping the advantage of many\r\ndifficulties; so, also, although a perfect man may not have sinned in act,\r\nand yet endures afflictions, he suffers similarly with the child. Having\r\nwithin him the sinful principle, but not embracing the opportunity of\r\ncommitting sin, he does not sin; so that it is to be reckoned to him as\r\nnot having sinned. For as he who wishes to commit adultery is an\r\nadulterer, although he fails to commit adultery, and he who wishes to\r\ncommit murder is a murderer, although he is unable to kill; so, also, if I\r\nsee the man without sin, whom I refer to, suffering, though he have done\r\nnothing bad, I should call him bad on account of the wish to sin. For I\r\nwill affirm anything rather than call Providence evil.” Then, in\r\ncontinuation, he says expressly concerning the Lord, as concerning man:\r\n“If, then, passing from all these observations, you were to proceed to put\r\nme to shame by saying, perchance impersonating certain parties, This man\r\nhas then sinned, for this man has suffered; if you permit, I will say, He\r\nhas not sinned, but was like a child suffering. If you insist more\r\nurgently, I would say, That the man you name is man, but God is righteous,\r\n‘for no one is pure,’ as one said, ‘from pollution.’ ” But the hypothesis\r\nof Basilides says that the soul, having sinned before in another life,\r\nendures punishment in this—the elect soul with honor by martyrdom, the\r\nother purged by appropriate punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, I, 24:3 _ff._ (MSG, 7:675.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The system of Basilides, as presented by Irenæus, is dualistic and\r\n    emanationist; with it is to be compared the presentation of the\r\n    system by Hippolytus in his _Philosophumena_, where it appears as\r\n    evolutionary and pantheistic. The trend of present opinion appears\r\n    to be that the account given by Irenæus is more correct, or, at\r\n    least, is earlier. The following account has all the appearance of\r\n    having been taken from an original source (_cf._ Hilgenfeld,\r\n    _Ketzergeschichte_, 195, 198). It represents the esoteric and more\r\n    distinctively Gnostic teaching of the school.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 3. Basilides, to appear to have discovered something more sublime and\r\nplausible, gives an immense development to his doctrine. He declares that\r\nin the beginning the Nous was born of the unborn Father, that from him in\r\nturn was born the Logos, then from the Logos the Phronesis, from the\r\nPhronesis Sophia and Dynamis, and from Dynamis and Sophia the powers and\r\nprincipalities and angels, whom he calls the first; and that by these the\r\nfirst heaven was made. Then by emanation from these others were formed,\r\nand these created another heaven similar to the first. And in like manner,\r\nwhen still others had been formed by emanations from these, corresponding\r\nto those who were over them, they framed another third heaven; and from\r\nthis third heaven downward there was a fourth succession of descendants;\r\nand so on, in the same manner, they say that other and still other princes\r\nand angels were formed, and three hundred and sixty-five heavens.\r\nWherefore the year contained the same number of days in conformity with\r\nthe number of the heavens.\r\n\r\nCh. 4. The angels occupying the lowest heaven, that, namely, which is\r\nvisible to us, created all those things which are in the world, and made\r\nallotments among themselves of the earth, and of those nations which are\r\nupon it. The chief of them is he who is thought to be the God of the Jews.\r\nInasmuch as he wished to make the other nations subject to his own people,\r\nthe Jews, all the other princes resisted and opposed him. Wherefore all\r\nother nations were hostile to his nation. But the unbegotten and nameless\r\nFather, seeing their ruin, sent his own first-begotten Nous, for he it is\r\nwho is called Christ, to set free from the power of those who made the\r\nworld them that believe in him. He therefore appeared on earth as a man to\r\nthe nations of those powers and wrought miracles. Wherefore he did not\r\nhimself suffer death, but Simon, a certain Cyrenian, was compelled and\r\nbore the cross in his stead; and this latter was transfigured by him that\r\nhe might be thought to be Jesus and was crucified through ignorance and\r\nerror; but Jesus himself took the form of Simon and stood by and derided\r\nhim. For as he is an incorporeal power and the Nous of the unborn Father,\r\nhe transfigured himself at pleasure, and so ascended to him who had sent\r\nhim, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be held, and was invisible to\r\nall. Those, then, who know these things have been freed from the princes\r\nwho made the world; so that it is not necessary to confess him who was\r\ncrucified, but him who came in the form of a man, and was thought to have\r\nbeen crucified, and was called Jesus, and was sent by the Father, that by\r\nthis dispensation he might destroy the works of the makers of the world.\r\nTherefore, Basilides says that if any one confesses the crucified, he is\r\nstill a slave, under the power of those who made our bodies; but whoever\r\ndenies him has been freed from these beings and is acquainted with the\r\ndispensation of the unknown Father.\r\n\r\nCh. 5. Salvation is only of the soul, for the body is by nature\r\ncorruptible. He says, also, that even the prophecies were derived from\r\nthose princes who made the world, but the law was especially given by\r\ntheir chief, who led the people out of the land of Egypt. He attaches no\r\nimportance to meats offered to idols, thinks them of no consequence, but\r\nmakes use of them without hesitation. He holds, also, the use of other\r\nthings as indifferent, and also every kind of lust. These men,\r\nfurthermore, use magic, images, incantations, invocations, and every other\r\nkind of curious arts. Coining also certain names as if they were those of\r\nthe angels, they assert that some of these belong to the first, others to\r\nthe second, heaven; and then they strive to set forth the names,\r\nprinciples, angels, powers, of the three hundred and sixty-five imagined\r\nheavens. They also affirm that the name in which the Saviour ascended and\r\ndescended is Caulacau.(43)\r\n\r\nCh. 6. He, then, who has learned these things, and known all the angels\r\nand their causes, is rendered invisible and incomprehensible to the angels\r\nand powers, even as Caulacau also was. And as the Son was unknown to all,\r\nso must they also be known by no one; but while they know all and pass\r\nthrough all, they themselves remain invisible and unknown to all; for “Do\r\nthou,” they say, “know all, but let nobody know thee.” For this reason,\r\npersons of such a persuasion are also ready to recant, yea, rather, it is\r\nimpossible that they should suffer on account of a mere name, since they\r\nare alike to all. The multitude, however, cannot understand these matters,\r\nbut only one out of a thousand, or two out of ten thousand. They declare\r\nthat they are no longer Jews, and that they are not yet Christians; and\r\nthat it is not at all fitting to speak openly of their mysteries, but\r\nright to keep them secret by preserving silence.\r\n\r\nCh. 7. They make out the local position of the three hundred and\r\nsixty-five heavens in the same way as do the mathematicians. For,\r\naccepting the theorems of the latter, they have transferred them to their\r\nown style of doctrine. They hold that their chief is Abraxas [or Abrasax];\r\nand on this account that the word contains in itself the numbers amounting\r\nto three hundred and sixty-five.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. The School of Valentinus\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Valentinians were the most important of all the Gnostics closely\r\nconnected with the Church. The school had many adherents scattered\r\nthroughout the Roman Empire, its leading teachers were men of culture and\r\nliterary ability, and the sect maintained itself a long time. Valentinus\r\nhimself was a native of Egypt, and probably educated at Alexandria, where\r\nhe may have come under the influence of Basilides. He taught his own\r\nsystem chiefly at Rome c. 140-c. 160. The great work of Irenæus against\r\nthe Gnostics, although having all Gnostics in view, especially deals with\r\nthe Valentinians in their various forms, because Irenæus was of the\r\nopinion that he who refutes their system refutes all (_cf. Adv. Hær._, IV,\r\n_præf._, 2). It is difficult to reconstruct with certainty the esoteric\r\nsystem of Valentinus as distinguished from possibly later developments of\r\nthe school, as Irenæus, the principal authority, follows not only\r\nValentinus, but Ptolomæus and others, in describing the system. The\r\nfollowing selection of sources gives fragments of the letters and other\r\nwritings of Valentinus himself as preserved by Clement of Alexandria,\r\npassages from Irenæus bringing out distinctive features of the system, and\r\nthe important letter of Ptolemæus to Flora, one of the very few extant\r\nwritings of the Gnostics of an early date. It gives a good idea of the\r\ncharacter of the exoteric teaching of the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: The principal authority for the system\r\n    of the Valentinians is Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, Lib. I (ANF), see\r\n    also Hippolytus, _Refut._, VI, 24-32 (ANF); “The Hymn of the\r\n    Soul,” from the _Acts of Thomas_, trans. by A. A. Bevan, _Texts\r\n    and Studies_, III, Cambridge, 1897; _The Fragments of Heracleon_,\r\n    trans. by A. E. Burke, _Text and Studies_, I, Cambridge, 1891; see\r\n    also ANF, IX, index, p. 526, _s. v., Heracleon_. The _Excerpta\r\n    Theodoti_ contained in ANF, VIII, are really the _Excerpta\r\n    Prophetica_, another collection, identified with the _Excerpta\r\n    Theodoti_ by mistake of the editor of the American edition, A. C.\r\n    Coxe (on the _Excerpta_, see Zahn, _History of the Canon of the\r\n    New Testament_).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Clement of Alexandria, _Strom._, IV, 13. (MSG, 8:1296.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following passages appear to be taken from the same homily of\r\n    Valentinus. The pneumatics are naturally immortal, but have\r\n    assumed mortality to overcome it. Death is the work of the\r\n    imperfect Demiurge. The concluding portion, which is very obscure,\r\n    does not fit well into the Valentinian system. _Cf._ Hilgenfeld,\r\n    _op. cit._, p. 300.\r\n\r\n\r\nValentinian in a homily writes in these words: “Ye are originally\r\nimmortal, and ye are children of eternal life, and ye desired to have\r\ndeath distributed to you, that ye may spend and lavish it, and that death\r\nmay die in you and by you; for when ye dissolve the world, and are not\r\nyourselves dissolved, ye have dominion over creation and all\r\ncorruption.”(44) For he also, similarly with Basilides, supposes a class\r\nsaved by nature [_i.e._, the pneumatics, _v. infra_], and that this\r\ndifferent race has come hither to us from above for the abolition of\r\ndeath, and that the origin of death is the work of the Creator of the\r\nworld. Wherefore, also, he thus expounds that Scripture, “No one shall see\r\nthe face of God and live” [Ex. 33:20], as if He were the cause of death.\r\nRespecting this God, he makes those allusions, when writing, in these\r\nexpressions: “As much as the image is inferior to the living face, so much\r\nis the world inferior to the living Eon. What is, then, the cause of the\r\nimage? It is the majesty of the face, which exhibits the figure to the\r\npainter, to be honored by his name; for the form is not found exactly to\r\nthe life, but the name supplies what is wanting in that which is formed.\r\nThe invisibility of God co-operates also for the sake of the faith of that\r\nwhich has been fashioned.” For the Demiurge, called God and Father, he\r\ndesignated the image and prophet of the true God, as the Painter, and\r\nWisdom, whose image, which is formed, is to the glory of the invisible\r\nOne; since the things which proceed from a pair [syzygy] are complements\r\n[_pleromata_], and those which proceed from one are images. But since what\r\nis seen is no part of Him, the soul [_psyche_] comes from what is\r\nintermediate, and is different; and this is the inspiration of the\r\ndifferent spirit. And generally what is breathed into the soul, which is\r\nthe image of the spirit [_pneuma_], and in general, what is said of the\r\nDemiurge, who was made according to the image, they say was foretold by a\r\nsensible image in the book of Genesis respecting the origin of man; and\r\nthe likeness they transfer to themselves, teaching that the addition of\r\nthe different spirit was made, unknown to the Demiurge.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Clement of Alexandria, _Strom._, II, 20. (MSG, 8:1057.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    According to Basilides, the various passions of the soul were no\r\n    original parts of the soul, but appendages to the soul. “They were\r\n    in essence certain spirits attached to the rational soul, through\r\n    some original perturbation and confusion; and that again, other\r\n    bastard and heterogeneous natures of spirits grow onto them, like\r\n    that of the wolf, the ape, the lion, and the goat, whose\r\n    properties, showing themselves around the soul, they say,\r\n    assimilate the lusts of the soul to the likeness of these\r\n    animals.” See the whole passage immediately preceding the\r\n    following fragment. The fragment can best be understood by\r\n    reference to the presentation of the system by W. Bousset in\r\n    _Encyc. Brit._, eleventh ed., art. “Basilides.”\r\n\r\n\r\nValentinus, too, in a letter to certain people, writes in these very words\r\nrespecting the appendages: “There is One good, by whose presence is the\r\nmanifestation, which is by the Son, and by Him alone can the heart become\r\npure, by the expulsion of every evil spirit from the heart; for the\r\nmultitude of spirits dwelling in it do not suffer it to be pure; but each\r\nof them performs his own deeds, insulting it oft with unseemly lusts. And\r\nthe heart seems to be treated somewhat like a caravansary. For the latter\r\nhas holes and ruts made in it, and is often filled with filthy dung; men\r\nliving filthily in it, and taking no care for the place as belonging to\r\nothers. So fares it with the heart as long as there is no thought taken\r\nfor it, being unclean and the abode of demons many. But when the only good\r\nFather visits it, it is sanctified and gleams with light. And he who\r\npossesses such a heart is so blessed that he shall see God.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Clement of Alexandria, _Strom._, II. 8. (MSG, 8:972.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The teaching in the following passage attaches itself to the text,\r\n    “The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom” (_cf._ Prov. 1:7).\r\n    Compare with it Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, I, 30:6.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the followers of Basilides, interpreting this expression [Prov. 1:7]\r\nsay that “the Archon, having heard the speech of the Spirit, who was being\r\nministered to, was struck with amazement both with the voice and the\r\nvision, having had glad tidings beyond his hopes announced to him; and\r\nthat his amazement was called fear, which became the origin of wisdom,\r\nwhich distinguishes classes, and discriminates, and perfects, and\r\nrestores. For not the world alone, but also the election, He that is over\r\nall has set apart and sent forth.”\r\n\r\nAnd Valentinus appears also in an epistle to have adopted such views. For\r\nhe writes in these very words: “And as terror fell on the angels at this\r\ncreature, because he uttered things greater than proceeds from his\r\nformation, by reason of the being in him who had invisibly communicated a\r\ngerm of the supernal essence, and who spoke with free utterance; so, also,\r\namong the tribes of men in the world the works of men became terrors to\r\nthose who made them—as, for example, images and statues. And the hands of\r\nall fashion things to bear the image of God; for Adam, formed into the\r\nname of man, inspired the dread attaching to the pre-existing man, as\r\nhaving his being in him; and they were terror-stricken and speedily marred\r\nthe work.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Clement of Alexandria, _Strom._, III, 7. (MSG, 8:1151.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Docetism of Valentinus comes out in the following. It is to be\r\n    noted that Clement not only does not controvert the position taken\r\n    by the Gnostic as to the reality of the bodily functions of Jesus,\r\n    but in his own person makes almost the same assertions (_cf.\r\n    Strom._, VI, 9). He might indeed call himself, as he does in this\r\n    latter passage, a Gnostic in the sense of the true or Christian\r\n    Gnostic, but he comes very close to the position of the\r\n    non-Christian Gnostic.\r\n\r\n\r\nValentinus in an epistle to Agathopous says: “Since He endured all things,\r\nand was continent [_i.e._, self-controlled], Jesus, accordingly, obtained\r\nfor Himself divinity. He ate and drank in a peculiar manner, not giving\r\nforth His food. Such was the power of His continence [self-control] that\r\nthe food was not corrupted in Him, because He himself was without\r\ncorruption.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, I, 7, 15; I, 8, 23. (MSG, 7:517, 528.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The division of mankind into three classes, according to their\r\n    nature and consequent capacity for salvation, is characteristic of\r\n    the Valentinian Gnosticism. The other Gnostics divided mankind\r\n    into two classes: those capable of salvation, or the pneumatics,\r\n    or Gnostics, and those who perish in the final destruction of\r\n    material existence, or the hylics. Valentinus avails himself of\r\n    the notion of the trichotomy of human nature, and gives a place\r\n    for the bulk of Christians, those who did not embrace Gnosticism;\r\n    _cf._ Irenæus, _ibid._, I, 6. Valentinus remained long within the\r\n    Church, accommodating his teaching as far as possible, and in its\r\n    exoteric side very fully, to the current teaching of the Church.\r\n    The doctrine as to the psychics, capable of a limited salvation,\r\n    appears to be a part of this accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI, 7, 5. The Valentinians conceive of three kinds of men: the pneumatic\r\n[or spiritual], the choic [or material],(45) and the psychic [or animal];\r\nsuch were Cain, Abel, and Seth. These three natures are no longer in one\r\nperson, but in the race. The material goes to destruction. The animal, if\r\nit chooses the better part, finds repose in an intermediate place; but if\r\nit chooses the worse, it, too, goes to the same [destruction]. But they\r\nassert that the spiritual principles, whatever Acamoth has sown, being\r\ndisciplined and nourished here from that time until now in righteous\r\nsouls, because they were sent forth weak, at last attain perfection and\r\nshall be given as brides(46) to the angels of the Saviour, but their\r\nanimal souls necessarily rest forever with the Demiurge in the\r\nintermediate place. And again subdividing the animal souls themselves,\r\nthey say that some are by nature good and others are by nature evil. The\r\ngood are those who become capable of receiving the seed; the evil by\r\nnature, those who are never able to receive that seed.\r\n\r\nI, 8, 23. The parable of the leaven which the woman is said to have hid in\r\nthree measures of meal they declare manifests the three kinds of men:\r\npneumatic, psychic, and the choic, but the leaven denoted the Saviour\r\nhimself. Paul also very plainly set forth the choic, the psychic, and the\r\npneumatic, saying in one place: “As is the earthy [choic] such are they\r\nalso that are earthy” [I Cor. 15:48]; and in another place, “He that is\r\nspiritual [pneumatic] judgeth all things” [I Cor. 2:14]. And the passage,\r\n“The animal man receiveth not the things of the spirit” [I Cor. 2:15],\r\nthey affirm was spoken concerning the Demiurge, who, being psychic, knew\r\nneither his mother, who was spiritual, nor her seed, nor the Eons in the\r\npleroma.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Irenæus. _Adv. Hær._, I, 1. (MSG, 7:445 _f._)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following passage appears, from the context, to have been\r\n    written with the teaching of Ptolemæus especially in mind. It\r\n    should be compared with the account further on in the same book,\r\n    I, 11: 1-3. The syzygies are characteristic of the Valentinian\r\n    teaching, and the symbolism of marriage plays an important part in\r\n    the “system” of all the Valentinians. In the words of Duchesne\r\n    (_Hist. ancienne de l’église_, sixth ed., p. 171): “Valentinian\r\n    Gnosticism is from one end to the other a ‘marriage Gnosticism.’\r\n    From the most abstract origins of being to their end, there are\r\n    only syzygies, marriages, and generations.” For the connection\r\n    between these conceptions and antinomianism, see Irenæus, _Adv.\r\n    Hær._, I, 6:3 _f._ For their sacramental application, _ibid._, I,\r\n    21:3. _Cf._ I, 13:3, a passage which seems to belong to the\r\n    sacrament of the bridal chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey [the Valentinians] say that in the invisible and ineffable heights\r\nabove there exists a certain perfect, pre-existent Eon, and him they call\r\nProarche, Propator, and Bythos; and that he is invisible and that nothing\r\nis able to comprehend him. Since he is comprehended by no one, and is\r\ninvisible, eternal, and unbegotten, he was in silence and profound\r\nquiescence in the boundless ages. There existed along with him Ennœa, whom\r\nthey call Charis and Sige. And at a certain time this Bythos determined to\r\nsend forth from himself the beginnings of all things, and just as seed he\r\nwished to send forth this emanation, and he deposited it in the womb of\r\nher who was with him, even of Sige. She then received this seed, and\r\nbecoming pregnant, generated Nous, who was both similar and equal to him\r\nwho had sent him forth(47) and alone comprehended his father’s greatness.\r\nThis Nous they also call Monogenes and Father and the Beginning of all\r\nThings. Along with him was also sent forth Aletheia; and these four\r\nconstituted the first and first-begotten Pythagorean Tetrad, which also\r\nthey denominate the root of all things. For there are first Bythos and\r\nSige, and then Nous and Aletheia. And Monogenes, when he perceived for\r\nwhat purpose he had been sent forth, also himself sent forth Logos and\r\nZoe, being the father of all those who are to come after him, and the\r\nbeginning and fashioning of the entire pleroma. From Logos and Zoe were\r\nsent forth, by a conjunction, Anthropos and Ecclesia, and thus were formed\r\nthe first-begotten Ogdoad, the root and substance of all things, called\r\namong them by four names; namely, Bythos, Nous, Logos, and Anthropos. For\r\neach of these is at once masculine and feminine, as follows: Propator was\r\nunited by a conjunction with his Ennœa, then Monogenes (_i.e._, Nous) with\r\nAletheia, Logos with Zoe, Anthropos with Ecclesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Ptolemæus, _Epistula ad Floram_, ap. Epiphanius, _Panarion, Hær._\r\nXXXIII, 3. Ed. Oehler, 1859. (MSG, 41:557.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ptolemæus was possibly the most important disciple of Valentinus.\r\n    and the one to whom Irenæus is most indebted for his first-hand\r\n    knowledge of the teaching of the sect of the Valentinians. Of his\r\n    writings have been preserved, in addition to numerous brief\r\n    fragments, a connected passage of some length, apparently from a\r\n    commentary on the Prologue or the Gospel of St. John (see Irenæus,\r\n    _Adv. Hær._, I, 8:5), and the Epistle to Flora. The commentary is\r\n    distinctly a part of the esoteric teaching, the epistle is as\r\n    clearly exoteric.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat many have not(48) received the Law given by Moses, my dear sister\r\nFlora, without recognizing either its fundamental ideas or its precepts,\r\nwill be perfectly clear to you, I believe, if you become acquainted with\r\nthe different views regarding the same. For some [_i.e._, the Church] say\r\nthat it was commanded by God and the Father; but others [_i.e._, the\r\nMarcionites], taking the opposite direction, affirm that it was commanded\r\nby an opposing and injurious devil, and they attribute to him the creation\r\nof the world, and say that he is the Father and Creator. But such as teach\r\nsuch doctrine are altogether deceived, and each of them strays from the\r\ntruth of what lies before him. For it appears not to have been given by\r\nthe perfect God and Father, because it is itself imperfect, and it needs\r\nto be completed [_cf._ Matt. 5:17], and it has precepts not consonant with\r\nthe nature and mind of God; neither is the Law to be attributed to the\r\nwickedness of the adversary, whose characteristic is to do wrong. Such do\r\nnot know what was spoken by the Saviour, that a city or a house divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand, as our Saviour has shown us. And besides, the\r\nApostle says that the creation of the world was His work (all things were\r\nmade by Him and without Him nothing was made), refuting the unsubstantial\r\nwisdom of lying men, the work not of a god working ruin, but a just one\r\nwho hates wickedness. This is the opinion of rash men who do not\r\nunderstand the cause of the providence of the Creator [Demiurge] and have\r\nlost the eyes not only of their soul, but of their body. How far,\r\ntherefore, such wander from the way of truth is evident to you from what\r\nhas been said. But each of these is induced by something peculiar to\r\nhimself to think thus, some by ignorance of the God of righteousness:\r\nothers by ignorance of the Father of all, whom the Only One who knew Him\r\nalone revealed when He came. To us it has been reserved to be deemed\r\nworthy of making manifest to you the ideas of both of these, and to\r\ninvestigate carefully this Law, whence anything is, and the law-giver by\r\nwhom it was commanded, bringing proofs of what shall be said from the\r\nwords of our Saviour, by which alone one can be led without error to the\r\nknowledge of things.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is to be known that the entire Law contained in the\r\nPentateuch of Moses was not given by one—I mean not by God alone; but some\r\nof its precepts were given by men, and the words of the Saviour teach us\r\nto divide it into three parts. For He attributes some of it to God himself\r\nand His law-giving, and some to Moses, not in the sense that God gave laws\r\nthrough him, but in the sense that Moses, impelled by his own spirit, set\r\ndown some things as laws; and He attributes some things to the elders of\r\nthe people, who first discovered certain commandments of their own and\r\nthen inserted them. How this was so you clearly learn from the words of\r\nthe Saviour. Somewhere the Saviour was conversing with the people, who\r\ndisputed with Him about divorce, that it was allowed in the Law, and He\r\nsaid to them: Moses, on account of the hardness of your hearts, permitted\r\na man to divorce his wife; but from the beginning it was not so. For God,\r\nsaid He, joined this bond, and what the Lord joined together let not man,\r\nHe said, put asunder. He therefore pointed out one law that forbids a\r\nwoman to be separated from her husband, which was of God, and another,\r\nwhich was of Moses, that allows, on account of the hardness of men’s\r\nhearts, the bond to be dissolved. And accordingly, Moses gives a law\r\nopposed to God, for it is opposed to the law forbidding divorce. But if we\r\nconsider carefully the mind of Moses, according to which he thus\r\nlegislated, we shall find that he did not do this of his own mere choice,\r\nbut by constraint because of the weakness of those to whom he was giving\r\nthe law. For since they were not able to observe that precept of God by\r\nwhich it was not permitted them to cast forth their wives, with whom some\r\nof them lived unhappily, and because of this they were in danger of\r\nfalling still more into unrighteousness, and from that into utter ruin,\r\nMoses, intending to avoid this unhappy result, because they were in danger\r\nof ruin, gave a certain second law, according to circumstances less evil,\r\nin place of the better; and by his own authority gave the law of divorce\r\nto them, that if they could not keep that they might keep this, and should\r\nnot fall into unrighteousness and wickedness by which complete ruin should\r\novertake them. This was his purpose in as far as he is found giving laws\r\ncontrary to God. That thus the law of Moses is shown to be other than the\r\nLaw of God is indisputable, if we have shown it in one instance.\r\n\r\nAnd as to there being certain traditions of the elders which have been\r\nincorporated in the Law, the Saviour shows this also. For God, said He,\r\ncommanded: Honor thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee.\r\nBut ye, He said, addressing the elders, have said: It is a gift to God,\r\nthat by which ye might be profited by me, and ye annul the law of God by\r\nthe traditions of your elders. And this very thing Isaiah declared when he\r\nsaid: This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from\r\nme, vainly do they worship me, teaching the doctrines and commandment of\r\nmen [_cf._ Matt. 15:4-9.] Clearly, then, from these things it is shown\r\nthat this whole Law is to be divided into three parts. And in it we find\r\nlaws given by Moses, by the elders, and by God; and this division of the\r\nwhole Law as we have made it, has shown the real truth as to the Law.\r\n\r\nBut one portion of the Law, that which is from God, is again to be divided\r\ninto three parts: first, into the genuine precepts, quite untainted with\r\nevil, which is properly called the law, and which the Saviour came not to\r\ndestroy but to complete (for what he completed was not alien to Him, but\r\nyet it was not perfect); secondly, the part comprising evil and\r\nunrighteous things, which the Saviour did away with as something unfitting\r\nHis nature; and thirdly, the part which is for types and symbols, which is\r\ngiven as a law, as images of things spiritual and excellent which, from\r\nbeing evident and manifest to the senses, the Saviour changed into the\r\nspiritual and unseen. Now the law of God, pure and untainted with anything\r\nbase, is the Decalogue itself, or those ten precepts distributed in two\r\ntables, for the prohibition of things to be avoided and the performance of\r\nthings to be done. Although they constitute a pure body of laws, yet they\r\nare not perfect, but need to be completed by the Saviour. But there is\r\nthat body of commands which are tainted with unrighteousness; such is the\r\nlaw requiring vengeance and requital of injuries upon those who have first\r\ninjured us, commanding the smiting out of an eye for an eye and a tooth\r\nfor a tooth and revenging bloodshed with bloodshed. For one who is second\r\nin doing unrighteousness acts no less unrighteously, when the difference\r\nis only one of order, doing the self-same work. But such a precept was,\r\nand is, in other respects just, because of the infirmity of those to whom\r\nthe law was given, and it was given in violation of the pure law, and was\r\nnot consonant with the nature and goodness of the Father of all; it was to\r\na degree appropriate, but yet given under a certain compulsion. For he who\r\nforbids the commission of a single murder in that he says, Thou shalt not\r\nkill, but commands that he who kills shall in requital be killed, gives a\r\nsecond law and commands a second slaying, when he has forbidden one, and\r\nhas been compelled to do this by necessity. And therefore the Son, sent by\r\nHim, abolishes this portion of the Law, He himself confessing that it is\r\nfrom God, and this, among other things, is to be attributed to an ancient\r\nheresy, among which, also, is that God, speaking, says: He that curseth\r\nfather or mother, let him die the death. But there is that part of the Law\r\nwhich is typical, laying down that which is an image of things spiritual\r\nand excellent, which gives laws concerning such matters as offerings, I\r\nmean, and circumcision, the Sabbath and fasting, the passover and the\r\nunleavened bread, and such like. For all these things, being images and\r\nsymbols of the truth which had been manifested, have been changed. They\r\nwere abrogated so far as they were external, visible acts of bodily\r\nperformance, but they were retained so far as they were spiritual, the\r\nnames remaining, but the things being changed. For the Saviour commands us\r\nto present offerings, though not of irrational animals or of incense, but\r\nspiritual offerings—praise, glory, and thanksgiving, and also liberality\r\nand good deeds toward the neighbor. He would have us circumcised with a\r\ncircumcision not of the flesh, but spiritual and of the heart; and have us\r\nobserve the Sabbath, for he wishes us to rest from wicked actions; and\r\nfast, but he does not wish us to observe a bodily fast, but a spiritual,\r\nin that we abstain from all that is unworthy. External fasting, however,\r\nis observed among our people, since it is capable of benefiting the soul\r\nto some degree, if it is practised with reason, when it is neither\r\nperformed from imitation of any one, nor by custom, nor on account of a\r\nday, as if a day were set apart for that purpose; and at the same time it\r\nis also for a reminder of true fasting, that they who are not able to fast\r\nthus may have a reminder of it from the fast which is external. And that\r\nthe passover, in the same way, and the unleavened bread are images, the\r\nApostle Paul also makes clear, saying: Christ our Passover is sacrificed\r\nfor us, and That ye may be unleavened, not having any leaven (for he calls\r\nleaven wickedness), but that ye may be a new dough.\r\n\r\nThis entire Law, therefore, acknowledged to be from God, is divided into\r\nthree parts: into that part which is fulfilled by the Saviour, such as\r\nThou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not\r\nforswear thyself, for they are included in this, thou shalt not be angry,\r\nthou shalt not lust, thou shalt not swear; into that which is completely\r\nabolished, such as an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, being\r\ntainted with unrighteousness, and having the same work of unrighteousness,\r\nand these are taken away by the Saviour because contradictory (for those\r\nthings which are contradictory are mutually destructive), “For I say unto\r\nyou that ye in no wise resist evil, but if any one smite thee turn to him\r\nthe other cheek also;” and into that part which is changed and converted\r\nfrom that which is bodily into that which is spiritual, as he expounds\r\nallegorically a symbol which is commanded as an image of things that are\r\nexcellent. For these images and symbols, fitted to represent other things,\r\nwere good so long as the truth was not yet present; but when the truth is\r\npresent, it is necessary to do the things of truth, not the image of\r\ntruth. The same thing his disciples and the Apostle Paul teach, inasmuch\r\nas in regard to things which are images, as we have already said, they\r\nshow by the passover and the unleavened bread that they are for our sake,\r\nbut in regard to the law which is tainted with unrighteousness, they call\r\nit the law of commandments and ordinances, that is done away; but as to\r\nthe law which is untainted with evil, he says that the law is holy and the\r\ncommandment holy and just and good.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I think that it has been sufficiently shown you, so far as it\r\nis possible to discuss the matter briefly, that there are laws of men\r\nwhich have slipped in, and there is the very Law of God which is divided\r\ninto three parts. There remains, therefore, for us to show, who, then, is\r\nthat God who gave the Law. But I think that this has been shown you in\r\nwhat has already been said, if you have listened attentively. For if the\r\nLaw was not given by the perfect God, as we have shown, nor by the devil,\r\nwhich idea merely to mention is unlawful, there is another beside these,\r\none who gave the Law. This one is, therefore, the Demiurge and maker of\r\nthis whole world and of all things in it, different from the nature of the\r\nother two, and placed between them, and who therefore rightly bears the\r\nname of the Midst. And if the perfect God is good according to His own\r\nnature, as also He is (for that there is only One who is good, namely, God\r\nand His Father, the Saviour asserted, the God whom He manifested), there\r\nis also one who is of the nature of the adversary, bad and wicked and\r\ncharacterized by unrighteousness. Standing, therefore, between these, and\r\nbeing neither good nor bad nor unjust, he can be called righteous in a\r\nsense proper to him, as the judge of the righteousness that corresponds to\r\nhim, and that god will be lower than the perfect God, and his\r\nrighteousness lower than His, because he is begotten and not unbegotten.\r\nFor there is one unbegotten One, the Father, from whom are all things, for\r\nall things have been prepared by Him. But He is greater and superior to\r\nthe adversary, and is of a different essence or nature from the essence of\r\nthe other. For the essence of the adversary is corruption and darkness,\r\nfor he is hylic and composite,(49) but the essence of the unbegotten\r\nFather of all is incorruptibility, and He is light itself, simple and\r\nuniform. But the essence of these(50) brings forth a certain twofold\r\npower, and he is the image of the better. Do not let these things disturb\r\nyou, who wish to learn how from one principle of all things, whom we\r\nacknowledge and in whom be believe, namely, the unbegotten and the\r\nincorruptible and the good, there exist two other natures, namely, that of\r\ncorruption and that of the Midst, which are not of the same essence\r\n[ἀνομοοῦσιοι], though the good by nature begets and brings forth what is\r\nlike itself, and of the same essence [ὁμοοῦσιος]. For you will learn by\r\nGod’s permission, in due order, both the beginning of this and its\r\ngeneration, since you are deemed worthy of the apostolic tradition, which\r\nby a succession we have received, and in due season to test all things by\r\nthe teaching of the Saviour. The things which in a few words I have said\r\nto you, my sister Flora, I have not exhausted, and I have written briefly.\r\nAt the same time I have sufficiently explained to you the subject\r\nproposed, and what I have said will be constantly of use to you, if as a\r\nbeautiful and good field you have received the seed and will by it produce\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23. Marcion\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently Marcion has been commonly treated apart from the Gnostics on\r\naccount of the large use he made of the Pauline writings. By some he has\r\neven been regarded as a champion of Pauline ideas which had failed to hold\r\na place in Christian thought. This opinion of Marcion is being modified\r\nunder the influence of a larger knowledge of Gnosticism. At the bottom\r\nMarcion’s doctrine was thoroughly Gnostic, though he differed from the\r\nvast majority of Gnostics in that his interest seems to have been\r\nprimarily ethical rather than speculative. His school maintained itself\r\nfor some centuries after undergoing some minor modifications. Marcion was\r\nteaching at Rome, A. D. 140. The aspersions upon his moral character must\r\nbe taken with caution, as it had already become a common practice to\r\nblacken the character of theological opponents, regardless of the truth, a\r\ncustom which has not yet wholly disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Justin Martyr, _Apol._, I. 26, 58;\r\n    Irenæus, III. 12:12 _ff._ The most important source is\r\n    Tertullian’s elaborate _Adversus Marcionem_, especially I, 1 _f._,\r\n    29; III, 8. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Irenæus, Adv. _Hær._, I, 27: 1-3. (MSG, 7:687.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The system of Cerdo and Marcion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 1. A certain Cerdo, who had taken his fundamental ideas from those who\r\nwere with Simon [_i.e._, Simon Magus], and who was in Rome in the time of\r\nHyginus, who held the ninth place from the Apostles in the episcopal\r\nsuccession, taught that the God who was preached by the law and the\r\nprophets is not the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the former is\r\nknown, but the latter is unknown; and the former is righteous, but the\r\nother is good.\r\n\r\nCh. 2. And Marcion of Pontus succeeded him and developed a school,\r\nblaspheming shamelessly Him who is proclaimed as God by the law and the\r\nprophets; saying that He is maker of evils and a lover of wars, inconstant\r\nin purpose and inconsistent with Himself. He said, however, that Jesus\r\ncame from the Father, who is above the God who made the world, into Judea\r\nin the time of Pontius Pilate, the procurator of Tiberius Cæsar, and was\r\nmanifested in the form of a man to those who were in Judea, destroying the\r\nprophets and the law, and all the works of that God who made the world and\r\nwhom he also called Cosmocrator. In addition to this, he mutilated the\r\nGospel which is according to Luke, and removed all that refers to the\r\ngeneration of the Lord, removing also many things from the teaching in the\r\nLord’s discourses, in which the Lord is recorded as very plainly\r\nconfessing that the founder of this universe is His Father; and thus\r\nMarcion persuaded his disciples that he himself is truer than the Apostles\r\nwho delivered the Gospel; delivering to them not the Gospel but a part of\r\nthe Gospel. But in the same manner he also mutilated the epistles of the\r\nApostle Paul, removing all that is plainly said by the Apostle concerning\r\nthat God who made the world, to the effect that He is the Father of our\r\nLord Jesus Christ, and all that the Apostle taught by quotation from the\r\nprophetical writings which foretold the coming of the Lord.\r\n\r\nCh. 3. He taught that salvation would be only of the souls of those who\r\nshould receive his doctrine, and that it is impossible for the body to\r\npartake of salvation, because it was taken from the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Tertullian, _Adv. Marcion._, I, 19; IV, 2, 3. (MSL, 2: 293. 393.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tertullian’s great work against Marcion is his most important and\r\n    most carefully written polemical treatise. He revised it three\r\n    times. The first book of the present revision dates from A. D.\r\n    207; the other books cannot be dated except conjecturally. In\r\n    spite of the openly displayed hostile animus of the writer, it can\r\n    be used with confidence when controlled by reference to other\r\n    sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nI, 19. Marcion’s special and principal work is the separation of the law\r\nand the Gospel; and his disciples will not be able to deny that in this\r\nthey have their best means by which they are initiated into, and confirmed\r\nin, this heresy. For these are Marcion’s antitheses—that is, contradictory\r\npropositions; and they aim at putting the Gospel at variance with the law,\r\nthat from the diversity of the statements of the two documents they may\r\nargue for a diversity of gods, also.\r\n\r\nIV, 2. With Marcion the mystery of the Christian religion dates from the\r\ndiscipleship of Luke. Since, however, it was under way previously, it must\r\nhave had its authentic materials by means of which it found its way down\r\nto Luke; and by aid of the testimony which it bore Luke himself becomes\r\nadmissible.\r\n\r\nIV, 3. Well, but because Marcion finds the Epistle to the Galatians by\r\nPaul, who rebukes even Apostles for “not walking uprightly according to\r\nthe truth of the Gospel” [Gal. 2:14], as well as accuses certain false\r\napostles of being perverters of the Gospel of Christ, he attempts to\r\ndestroy the standing of those gospels which are published as genuine and\r\nunder the names of Apostles, or of apostolic men, to secure, forsooth, for\r\nhis own gospel the credit he takes away from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Rhodon, in Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 13. (MSG, 20:459.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Rhodon, a native of Asia, who, as he himself states, had been\r\ninstructed at Rome by Tatian, with whom we have already become acquainted,\r\nwrote excellent books, and published among the rest one against the heresy\r\nof Marcion which, he says, was in his time divided into various sects; and\r\nhe describes those who occasioned the division and refutes carefully the\r\nfalsehood devised by each. But hear what he writes: “Therefore also they\r\nhave fallen into disagreement among themselves, and maintain inconsistent\r\nopinions. For Apelles, one of their herd, priding himself on his manner of\r\nlife and his age, acknowledged one principle [_i.e._, source of\r\nexistence], but says that the prophecies were from an opposing spirit. And\r\nhe was persuaded of the truth of this by the responses of a demoniac\r\nmaiden named Philumene. But others hold to two principles, as does the\r\nmariner Marcion himself, among these are Potitus and Basiliscus. These,\r\nfollowing the wolf of Pontus and, like him, unable to discover the\r\ndivisions of things, became reckless, and without any proof baldly\r\nasserted two principles. Again, others of them drifted into worse error\r\nand assumed not only two, but three, natures. Of these Syneros is the\r\nleader and chief, as those say who defend his teaching.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 24. Encratites\r\n\r\n\r\nAsceticism is a wide-spread phenomenon in nearly all religions. It is to\r\nbe found in apostolic Christianity. In the early Church it was regarded as\r\na matter in the option of the Christian who was aiming at the religious\r\nlife [see above, § 16]. The characteristic of the Encratites was their\r\ninsistence upon asceticism as essential to Christian living. They were\r\ntherefore associated, and with abundant historical justification, with\r\nGnosticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Clement of Alexandria, _Strom._, III,\r\n    _passim_; Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, IV, 29, _cf._ the many references\r\n    in the notes to McGiffert’s edition, PNF.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Hippolytus, VIII, 13. (MSG, 16:3368.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    See above, § 19, _c_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers, however, styling themselves Encratites, acknowledge some things\r\nconcerning God and Christ in like manner with the Church, but in respect\r\nto their mode of life they pass their time inflated with pride; thinking\r\nthat by meats they glorify themselves, they abstain from animal food, are\r\nwater drinkers, and, forbidding to marry, they devote the rest of their\r\nlife to habits of asceticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._ I, 28. (MSG, 7:690.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMany offshoots of numerous heresies have already been formed from those\r\nheresies which we have described.… By way of example, let us say there are\r\nthose springing from Saturninus and Marcion, who are called Encratites\r\n[_i.e._, self-controlled], who preached the unmarried state, thus setting\r\naside the original creation of God, and indirectly condemning Him who made\r\nmale and female for the propagation of the human race. Some of those\r\nreckoned as belonging to them have also introduced abstinence from animal\r\nfood, being ungrateful to God who created all things. They deny, also, the\r\nsalvation of him who was first created. It is but recently that this\r\nopinion has been discovered among them, since a certain man named Tatian\r\nfirst introduced the blasphemy. He had been a hearer of Justin’s, and as\r\nlong as he continued with him he expressed no such views; but after his\r\nmartyrdom [circa A. D. 165] he separated from the Church, and having\r\nbecome excited and puffed up by the thought of being a teacher, as if he\r\nwere superior to others, he composed his own peculiar type of doctrine. He\r\ninvented a system of certain invisible Eons, like the followers of\r\nValentinus; and like Marcion and Saturninus, he declared that marriage was\r\nnothing else than corruption and fornication. But this denial of Adam’s\r\nsalvation was an opinion due entirely to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 25. Montanism\r\n\r\n\r\nMontanism was, in part at least, an attempt to revive the enthusiastic\r\nprophetic element in the early Christian life. In its first\r\nmanifestations, in Asia Minor, Montanism was wild and fanatical. It soon\r\nspread to the West, and in doing so it became, as did other Oriental\r\nreligious movements (_e.g._, Gnosticism and Manichæanism, see § 54), far\r\nmore sober. It even seemed to many serious persons to be nothing more than\r\na praiseworthy attempt to revive or retain certain primitive Christian\r\nconditions, both in respect to personal morals and ecclesiastical\r\norganization and life. In this way it came to be patronized by not a few\r\n(_e.g._, Tertullian) who, in other respects, deviated in few or no points\r\nfrom the prevailing thought and practice of Christians. See also § 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 16-19, cf.\r\n    literature cited in McGiffert’s notes. The sayings of Montanus,\r\n    Maximilla, and Priscilla are collected in Hilgenfeld,\r\n    _Ketzergeschichte_, 591 _ff._ See also Hippolytus, _Refut._, X,\r\n    25_f._ [= X, 21, ANF.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 16:7. (MSG, 20:463.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    For Eusebius, see § 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is said to be a certain village named Ardabau, in Mysia, on the\r\nborders of Phrygia. There, they say, when Gratus was proconsul of Asia, a\r\nrecent convert, Montanus by name—who, in his boundless desire for\r\nleadership, gave the adversary opportunity against him—first became\r\ninspired; and falling into a sort of frenzy and ecstasy raved and began to\r\nbabble and utter strange sounds, prophesying in a manner contrary to the\r\ntraditional and constant custom of the Church from the beginning.… And he\r\nstirred up, besides, two women [Maximilla and Priscilla], and filled them\r\nwith the false spirit, so that they talked frantically, at unseasonable\r\ntimes, and in a strange manner, like the person already mentioned.… And\r\nthe arrogant spirit taught them to revile the universal and entire Church\r\nunder heaven, because the spirit of false prophecy received from it\r\nneither honor nor entrance into it; for the faithful in Asia met often and\r\nin many places throughout Asia to consider this matter and to examine the\r\nrecent utterances, and they pronounced them profane and rejected the\r\nheresy, and thus these persons were expelled from the Church and shut out\r\nfrom the communion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Apollonius, in Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 18. (MSG, 20:475.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Apollonius was possibly bishop of Ephesus. His work against the\r\n    Montanists, which appears to have been written about 197, was one\r\n    of the principal sources for Eusebius in his account of the\r\n    Montanists. Only fragments of his work have been preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is he who taught the dissolution of marriages; who laid down laws for\r\nfasting; who named Pepuza and Tymion (which were small cities in Phrygia)\r\nJerusalem, desiring to gather people to them from everywhere; who\r\nappointed collectors of money; who devised the receiving of gifts under\r\nthe name of offerings; who provided salaries for those who preached his\r\ndoctrine, so that by gluttony the teaching of his doctrine might prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Hippolytus, _Refut._, VIII, 19. (MSG, 16:3356.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    For Hippolytus, see § 19, _c_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there are others who are themselves in nature more heretical than the\r\nQuartodecimans. These are Phrygians by birth and they have been deceived,\r\nhaving been overcome by certain women called Priscilla and Maximilla; and\r\nthey hold these for prophetesses, saying that in them the Paraclete Spirit\r\ndwelt; and they likewise glorify one Montanus before these women as a\r\nprophet. So, having endless books of these people, they go astray, and\r\nthey neither judge their statements by reason nor pay attention to those\r\nwho are able to judge. But they behave without judgment in the faith they\r\nplace in them, saying they have learned something more through them than\r\nfrom the law and the prophets and the Gospels. But they glorify these\r\nwomen above the Apostles and every gift, so that some of them presume to\r\nsay that there was something more in them than in Christ. These confess\r\nGod the Father of the universe and creator of all things, like the Church,\r\nand all that the Gospel witnesses concerning Christ, but invent new fasts\r\nand feasts and meals of dry food and meals of radishes, saying that thus\r\nthey were taught by their women. And some of them agree with the heresy of\r\nthe Noetians and say that the Father is very Son, and that this One became\r\nsubject to birth and suffering and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. The Defence Against Heresy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church first met the various dangerous heresies which distracted it in\r\nthe second century by councils or gatherings of bishops (§ 26). Although\r\nit was not difficult to bring about a condemnation of novel and manifestly\r\nerroneous doctrine, there was need of fixed norms and definite authorities\r\nto which to appeal. This was found in the apostolic tradition, which could\r\nbe more clearly determined by reference to the continuity of the apostolic\r\noffice, or the episcopate, and especially to the succession of bishops in\r\nthe churches founded by Apostles (§ 27), the apostolic witness to the\r\ntruth, or the more precise determination of what writings should be\r\nregarded as apostolic, or the canon of the New Testament (§ 28); and the\r\napostolic faith, which was regarded as summed up in the Apostles’ Creed (§\r\n29). These norms of orthodoxy seem to have been generally established as\r\nauthoritative somewhat earlier in the West than in the East. The result\r\nwas that Gnosticism was rapidly expelled from the Church, though in some\r\nforms it lingered for centuries (§ 30), and that the Church, becoming\r\norganized around the episcopate, assumed by degrees a rigid hierarchical\r\nconstitution (§ 31).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 26. The Beginnings of Councils as a Defence against Heresy\r\n\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical councils were the first defence against heresy. As the\r\nChurch had not as yet attained its hierarchical constitution and the\r\nautonomy of the local church still persisted, these councils had little\r\nmore than the combined authority of the several members composing them.\r\nThey had, as yet, only moral force, and did not speak for the Church\r\nofficially. With the development of the episcopal constitution, the\r\ncouncils gained rapidly in authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: See Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 16\r\n    (given above, § 25, _a_), V, 24; Tertullian, _De Jejun._, 13\r\n    (given below, § 38).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Libellus Synodicus_, Man.

In this synod Montanus and Maximilla, the false prophets, and at\r\nthe same time, Theodotus the tanner, were condemned and expelled. A holy\r\nand local synod was gathered under the most holy Bishop Sotas of\r\nAnchialus(51) and twelve other bishops, who condemned and rejected\r\nTheodotus the tanner and Montanus together with Maximilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Eusebius. _Hist. Ec._, V, 18. (MSG, 20:475.) _Cf._ Mirbt, n. 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following should be connected with the first attempts of the\r\n    Church to meet the heresy of the Montanists by gatherings of\r\n    bishops. It also throws some light on the methods of dealing with\r\n    the new prophets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerapion, who, according to report, became bishop of Antioch at that time,\r\nafter Maximinus, mentions the works of Apollinarius against the\r\nabove-mentioned heresy. And he refers to him in a private letter to\r\nCaricus and Pontius, in which he himself exposes the same heresy, adding\r\nas follows: “That you may see that the doings of this lying band of new\r\nprophecy, as it is called, are an abomination to all the brethren\r\nthroughout the world, I have sent you writings of the most blessed\r\nClaudius Apollinarius, bishop of Hierapolis in Asia.” In the same letter\r\nof Serapion are found the signatures of several bishops, of whom one has\r\nsubscribed himself as follows: “I, Aurelius Cyrenius, a witness, pray for\r\nyour health.” And another after this manner: “Ælius Publius Julius, bishop\r\nof Debeltum, a colony of Thrace. As God liveth in the heavens, the blessed\r\nSotas in Anchialus desired to cast the demon out of Priscilla, but the\r\nhypocrites would not permit him.” And the autograph signatures of many\r\nother bishops who agreed with them are contained in the same letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 27. The Apostolic Tradition and the Episcopate\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gnostics claimed apostolic authority for their teaching and appealed\r\nto successions of teachers who had handed down their teachings. This\r\nprocedure forced the Church to lay stress upon the obvious fact that its\r\ndoctrine was derived from the Apostles, a matter on which it never had had\r\nany doubt, but was vouched for, not by obscure teachers, but by the\r\nchurches which had been founded by the Apostles themselves in large cities\r\nand by the bishops whom the Apostles had instituted in those churches.\r\nThose churches, furthermore, agreed among themselves, but the Gnostic\r\nteachers differed widely. By this appeal the bishop came to represent the\r\napostolic order (for an earlier conception _v. supra_, § 14, _b_, _c_),\r\nand to take an increasingly important place in the church (_v. infra_, §\r\n31).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: For Gnostic references to successions\r\n    of teachers, see Tertullian, _De Præscr._, 25; Clement of\r\n    Alexandria, _Strom._, VII, 17; Hippolytus, _Refut._, VII, 20. (=\r\n    VII, 8. ANF.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, III, 3: 1-4. (MSG, 7:848.) _Cf._ Mirbt, n. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first appearance of the appeal to apostolic tradition as\r\n    preserved in apostolic sees is the following passage from Irenæus,\r\n    written about 175. The reference to the church of Rome, beginning,\r\n    “For with this Church, on account of its more powerful\r\n    leadership,” has been a famous point of discussion. While it is\r\n    obscure in detail, the application of its general purport to the\r\n    argument of Irenæus is clear. Since for this passage we have not\r\n    the original Greek of Irenæus, but only the Latin translation,\r\n    there seems to be no way of clearing up the obscurities and\r\n    apparently contradictory statements. The text may be found in\r\n    Gwatkin, _op. cit._, and in part in Kirch, _op. cit._, §§ 110-113.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 1. The tradition, therefore, of the Apostles, manifested throughout\r\nthe world, is a thing which all who wish to see the facts can clearly\r\nperceive in every church; and we are able to count up those who were\r\nappointed bishops by the Apostles, and to show their successors to our own\r\ntime, who neither taught nor knew anything resembling these men’s ravings.\r\nFor if the Apostles had known hidden mysteries which they used to teach\r\nthe perfect, apart from and without the knowledge of the rest, they would\r\nhave delivered them especially to those to whom they were also committing\r\nthe churches themselves. For they desired them to be very perfect and\r\nblameless in all things, and were also leaving them as their successors,\r\ndelivering over to them their own proper place of teaching; for if these\r\nshould act rightly great advantage would result, but if they fell away the\r\nmost disastrous calamity would occur.\r\n\r\nCh. 2. But since it would be very long in such a volume as this to count\r\nup the successions [_i.e._, series of bishops] in all the churches, we\r\nconfound all those who in any way, whether through self-pleasing or\r\nvainglory, or through blindness and evil opinion, gather together\r\notherwise than they ought, by pointing out the tradition derived from the\r\nApostles of the greatest, most ancient, and universally known Church,\r\nfounded and established by the two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul,\r\nand also the faith declared to men which through the succession of bishops\r\ncomes down to our times. For with this Church, on account of its more\r\npowerful leadership [_potiorem principalitatem_], every church, that is,\r\nthe faithful, who are from everywhere, must needs agree; since in it that\r\ntradition which is from the Apostles has always been preserved by those\r\nwho are from everywhere.\r\n\r\nCh. 3. The blessed Apostles having founded and established the Church,\r\nintrusted the office of the episcopate to Linus.(52) Paul speaks of this\r\nLinus in his Epistles to Timothy. Anacletus succeeded him, and after\r\nAnacletus, in the third place from the Apostles, Clement received the\r\nepiscopate. He had seen and conversed with the blessed Apostles, and their\r\npreaching was still sounding in his ears and their tradition was still\r\nbefore his eyes. Nor was he alone in this, for many who had been taught by\r\nthe Apostles yet survived. In the times of Clement, a serious dissension\r\nhaving arisen among the brethren in Corinth, the Church of Rome sent a\r\nsuitable letter to the Corinthians, reconciling them in peace, renewing\r\ntheir faith, and proclaiming the doctrine lately received from the\r\nApostles.…\r\n\r\nEvaristus succeeded Clement, and Alexander Evaristus. Then Sixtus, the\r\nsixth from the Apostles, was appointed. After him Telesephorus, who\r\nsuffered martyrdom gloriously, and then Hyginus; after him Pius, and after\r\nPius Anicetus; Soter succeeded Anicetus, and now, in the twelfth place\r\nfrom the Apostles, Eleutherus [174-189] holds the office of bishop. In the\r\nsame order and succession the tradition and the preaching of the truth\r\nwhich is from the Apostles have continued unto us.\r\n\r\nCh. 4. But Polycarp, too, was not only instructed by the Apostles, and\r\nacquainted with many that had seen Christ, but was also appointed by\r\nApostles in Asia bishop of the church in Smyrna, whom we, too, saw in our\r\nearly youth (for he lived a long time, and died, when a very old man, a\r\nglorious and most illustrious martyr’s death); he always taught the things\r\nwhich he had learned from the Apostles, which the Church also hands down,\r\nand which alone are true. To these things all the Asiatic churches\r\ntestify, as do also those who, down to the present time, have succeeded\r\nPolycarp, who was a much more trustworthy and certain witness of the truth\r\nthan Valentinus and Marcion and the rest of the evil-minded. It was he who\r\nwas also in Rome in the time of Anicetus and caused many to turn away from\r\nthe above-mentioned heretics to the Church of God, proclaiming that he had\r\nreceived from the Apostles this one and only truth which has been\r\ntransmitted by the Church. And there are those who heard from him that\r\nJohn, the disciple of the Lord, going to bathe in Ephesus, when he saw\r\nCerinthus within, ran out of the bath-house without bathing, crying: “Let\r\nus flee, lest even the bath-house fall, because Cerinthus, the enemy of\r\nthe truth, is within.” And Polycarp himself, when Marcion once met him and\r\nsaid, “Knowest thou us?” replied, “I know the first-born of Satan.” Such\r\ncaution did the Apostles and their disciples exercise that they might not\r\neven converse with any of those who perverted the truth; as Paul, also,\r\nsaid: “A man that is a heretic after the first and second admonition,\r\nreject; knowing that he that is such subverteth and sinneth, being\r\ncondemned by himself.” There is also a very powerful Epistle of Polycarp\r\nwritten to the Philippians, from which those who wish to, and who are\r\nconcerned for their own salvation, may learn the character of his faith\r\nand the preaching of the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Tertullian, _De Prœscriptione_, 20, 21. (MSL, 2:38.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tertullian worked out in legal fashion the argument of Irenæus\r\n    from the testimony of the bishops in apostolic churches. He may\r\n    have obtained the argument from Irenæus, as he was evidently\r\n    acquainted with his works. From Tertullian’s use of the argument\r\n    it became a permanent element in the thought of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 20. The Apostles founded in the several cities churches from which the\r\nother churches have henceforth borrowed the shoot of faith and seeds of\r\nteaching and do daily borrow that they may become churches; and it is from\r\nthis fact that they also will be counted as apostolic, being the offspring\r\nof apostolic churches. Every kind of thing must be judged by reference to\r\nits origin. Therefore so many and so great churches are all one, being\r\nfrom that first Church which is from the Apostles. Thus they are all\r\nprimitive and all apostolic, since they altogether are approved by their\r\nunity, and they have the communion of peace, the title of brotherhood, and\r\nthe interchange of hospitality, and they are governed by no other rule\r\nthan the single tradition of the same mystery.\r\n\r\nCh. 21. Here, then, we enter our demurrer, that if the Lord Jesus Christ\r\nsent Apostles to preach, others than those whom Christ appointed ought not\r\nto be received as preachers. For no man knoweth the Father save the Son\r\nand he to whom the Son has revealed Him [_cf._ Luke 10:22]; nor does it\r\nappear that the Son has revealed Him unto any others than the Apostles,\r\nwhom He sent forth to preach what, of course, He had revealed to them.\r\nNow, what they should preach, that is, what Christ revealed to them, can,\r\nas I must likewise here enter as a demurrer, properly be proved in no\r\nother way than by those very churches which the Apostles themselves\r\nfounded by preaching to them, both _viva voce_, as the phrase is, and\r\nsubsequently by epistles. If this is so, it is evident that all doctrine\r\nwhich agrees with those apostolic churches, the wombs and origins of the\r\nfaith, must be reckoned for truth, as undoubtedly containing what the\r\nchurches received from the Apostles, the Apostles from Christ, Christ from\r\nGod. There remains, therefore, for us to show whether our doctrine, the\r\nrule of which we have given above [_v. infra_, § 29, _c_], agrees with the\r\ntradition of the Apostles, and likewise whether the others come from\r\ndeceit. We hold fast to the apostolic churches, because in none is there a\r\ndifferent doctrine; this is the witness of the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Tertullian, _De Præscriptione_, 36. (MSL, 2:58.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    It should be noted that the appeal to apostolic churches is to any\r\n    and all such, and is accordingly just so much the stronger in the\r\n    controversy in which it was brought forward. The argument,\r\n    whenever it occurs, does not turn upon the infallibility of any\r\n    one see or church as such. That point is not touched. Such a turn\r\n    to the argument would have weakened the force of the appeal in the\r\n    dispute with the Gnostics, however powerfully it might be used in\r\n    other controversies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCome, now, you who would indulge a better curiosity, if you would apply it\r\nto the business of your salvation, run over the apostolic churches, in\r\nwhich the very thrones of the Apostles are still pre-eminent in their\r\nplaces, in which their own authentic writings are read, uttering the voice\r\nand representing the face of each of them severally. Achaia is very near\r\nyou, in which you find Corinth. Since you are not far from Macedonia, you\r\nhave Philippi; there, too, you have the Thessalonians. Since you are able\r\nto cross to Asia, you get Ephesus. Since, moreover, you are close upon\r\nItaly, you have Rome, from which there comes even into our own hands the\r\nvery authority of Apostles themselves. How happy is that church, on which\r\nApostles poured forth all their doctrine along with their blood! Where\r\nPeter endures a passion like his Lord’s; where Paul wins a crown in a\r\ndeath like John’s; where the Apostle John was first plunged, unhurt, into\r\nboiling oil, and thence remitted to his island exile! See what she has\r\nlearned, what taught; what fellowship she has had with even our churches\r\nin Africa! One Lord God does she acknowledge, the Creator of the universe,\r\nand Christ Jesus born of the Virgin Mary, the Son of God the Creator; and\r\nthe resurrection of the flesh; the law and the prophets she unites in one\r\nvolume with the writings of Evangelists and Apostles, from which she\r\ndrinks in her faith. This she seals with the water of baptism, arrays with\r\nthe Holy Ghost, feeds with the eucharist, cheers with martyrdom, and\r\nagainst such a discipline thus maintained she admits no gainsayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 28. The Canon or the Authoritative New Testament Writings\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gnostics used in support of their doctrines writings which they\r\nattributed to the Apostles, thus having a direct apostolic witness to\r\nthese doctrines. This they did in imitation of the Church’s practice of\r\nusing apostolic writings for edification and instruction. Marcion drew up\r\na list of books which were alone to be regarded as authoritative among his\r\nfollowers [_v. supra_, § 23, _a_]. The point to be made by the champions\r\nof the faith of the great body of Christians was that only those books\r\ncould be legitimately used in support of Christian doctrine which could\r\nclaim actual apostolic origin and had been used continuously in the\r\nChurch. As a fact, the books to which they appealed had been in use\r\ngeneration after generation, but the Gnostic works were unknown until a\r\ncomparatively recent time and were too closely connected with only the\r\nfounders of a sect to deserve credence. It was a simple literary argument\r\nand appeal to tangible evidence. The list of books regarded as\r\nauthoritative constituted the Canon of Scripture. The state of the Canon\r\nin the second half of the second century, especially in the West, is shown\r\nin the following extracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: See Preuschen, _Analecta_, II,\r\n    Tübingen, 1910; Tatian, Diatessaron, ANF, IX; The Gospel of Peter,\r\n    _ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Muratorian Fragment._ Text, B. F. Westcott, _A General Survey\r\nof the History of the Canon of the New Testament_, seventh ed., Cambridge,\r\n1896. Appendix C; Kirch, n. 134; Preuschen, _Analecta_, II, 27. _Cf._\r\nMirbt, n. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The earliest list of canonical books of the New Testament was\r\n    found by L. A. Muratori in 1740 in a MS. of the eighth century. It\r\n    lacks beginning and end. It belongs to the middle or the second\r\n    half of the second century. It cannot with certainty be attributed\r\n    to any known person. The obscure Latin text is probably a\r\n    translation from the Greek. The fragment begins with what appears\r\n    to be an account of St. Mark’s Gospel.\r\n\r\n\r\n… but at some he was present, and so he set them down.\r\n\r\nThe third book of the gospels, that according to Luke. Luke, the\r\nphysician, compiled it in his own name in order, when, after the ascension\r\nof Christ, Paul had taken him to be with him like a student of law. Yet\r\nneither did he see the Lord in the flesh; and he, too, as he was able to\r\nascertain events, so set them down. So he began his story from the birth\r\nof John.\r\n\r\nThe fourth of the gospels is John’s, one of the disciples. When exhorted\r\nby his fellow-disciples and bishops, he said, “Fast with me this day for\r\nthree days; and what may be revealed to any of us, let us relate to one\r\nanother.” The same night it was revealed to Andrew, one of the Apostles,\r\nthat John was to write all things in his own name, and they were all to\r\ncertify.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, though various elements are taught in the several books of\r\nthe gospels, yet it makes no difference to the faith of the believers,\r\nsince by one guiding Spirit all things are declared in all of them\r\nconcerning the nativity, the passion, the resurrection, the conversation\r\nwith His disciples, and His two comings, the first in lowliness and\r\ncontempt, which has come to pass, the second glorious with royal power,\r\nwhich is to come.\r\n\r\nWhat marvel, therefore, if John so firmly sets forth each statement in his\r\nepistles, too, saying of himself: “What we have seen with our eyes and\r\nheard with our ears and our hands have handled, these things we have\r\nwritten to you”? For so he declares himself to be not an eye-witness and a\r\nhearer only, but also a writer of all the marvels of the Lord in order.\r\n\r\nThe acts, however, of all the Apostles are written in one book. Luke puts\r\nit shortly, “to the most excellent Theophilus,” that the several things\r\nwere done in his own presence, as he also plainly shows by leaving out the\r\npassion of Peter, and also the departure of Paul from the city [_i.e._,\r\nRome] on his journey to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe epistles, however, of Paul make themselves plain to those who wish to\r\nunderstand what epistles were sent by him, and from what place and for\r\nwhat cause. He wrote at some length, first of all, to the Corinthians,\r\nforbidding schisms and heresies; next to the Galatians, forbidding\r\ncircumcision; then to the Romans, impressing on them the plan of the\r\nScriptures, and also that Christ is the first principle of them,\r\nconcerning which severally it is necessary for us to discuss, since the\r\nblessed Apostle Paul himself, following the order of his predecessor John,\r\nwrites only by name to seven churches in the following order: to the\r\nCorinthians a first, to the Ephesians a second, to the Philippians a\r\nthird, to the Colossians a fourth, to the Galatians a fifth, to the\r\nThessalonians a sixth, to the Romans a seventh; and yet, although for the\r\nsake of admonition there is a second to the Corinthians and to the\r\nThessalonians, but one Church is recognized as being spread over the\r\nentire world. For John, too, in the Apocalypse, though he writes to seven\r\nchurches, yet speaks to all. Howbeit to Philemon one, to Titus one, and to\r\nTimothy two were put in writing from personal inclination and attachment,\r\nto be in honor, however, with the Catholic Church for the ordering of the\r\necclesiastical mode of life. There is current, also, one to the\r\nLaodiceans, another to the Alexandrians, [both] forged in Paul’s name to\r\nsuit a heresy of Marcion, and several others, which cannot be received\r\ninto the Catholic Church; for it is not fitting that gall be mixed with\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nThe Epistle of Jude, no doubt, and the couple bearing the name of John are\r\naccepted in the Catholic [Church], and the Wisdom written by the friends\r\nof Solomon in his honor. The Apocalypse, also, of John and of Peter only\r\nwe receive; which some of us will not have read in the Church. But the\r\nShepherd was written quite lately in our times by Hermas, while his\r\nbrother Pius, the bishop, was sitting in the chair of the church of the\r\ncity of Rome; and therefore it ought to be read, indeed, but it cannot to\r\nthe end of time be publicly read in the Church to the people, either among\r\nthe prophets, who are complete in number, or among the Apostles.\r\n\r\nBut of Valentinus, the Arsinoite, and his friends, we receive nothing at\r\nall, who have also composed a long new book of Psalms, together with\r\nBasilides and the Asiatic founder of the Montanists.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, III, II:8. (MSG, 7:885.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following extract illustrates the allegorical method of\r\n    exegesis in use throughout the Church, and also the opinion of the\r\n    author that there were but four gospels, and could be no more than\r\n    four. It should be noted that the symbolism of the beasts is not\r\n    that which has become current in ecclesiastical art.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not possible that the gospels be either more or fewer than they are.\r\nFor since there are four regions of the world in which we live, and four\r\nprincipal winds, and the Church is scattered over the whole earth, and the\r\npillar and ground of the Church is the Gospel and the Spirit of Life, it\r\nis fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing forth immortality\r\non every side, and giving life to men. From this it is evident that the\r\nWord, the Artificer of all, who sitteth upon the cherubim and who contains\r\nall things and was manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under four\r\nforms, but bound together by one Spirit. As also David says when he prayed\r\nfor His coming: “Thou that sittest between the cherubim, shine forth”\r\n[_cf._ Psalm 80:1]. For the cherubim, also, were four-faced, and their\r\nfaces were images of the dispensation of the Son of God. For he says, “The\r\nfirst living creature was like a lion” [_cf._ Ezek. 1:5 _ff._],\r\nsymbolizing His effectual working, leadership, and royal power; the second\r\nwas like a calf, symbolizing His sacrificial and sacerdotal order; but\r\n“the third had, as it were, the face of a man,” evidently describing His\r\ncoming as a human being; “the fourth was like a flying eagle,” pointing\r\nout the gift of the Spirit hovering over the Church. And therefore the\r\ngospels are in accord with these things, among which Christ is seated. For\r\nthat according to John relates His original, effectual, and glorious\r\ngeneration from the Father, thus declaring, “In the beginning was the Word\r\nand the Word was with God and the Word was God” [_cf._ John 1:1 _ff._],\r\nand further, “All things were made by Him and without Him was nothing\r\nmade.” For this reason, also, is that Gospel full of confidence, for such\r\nis His person. But that according to Luke, which takes up His priestly\r\ncharacter, commenced with Zacharias, the priest, who offers sacrifice to\r\nGod. For now was made ready the fatted calf, about to be immolated for the\r\nrecovery of the younger son [Luke 15:23]. Matthew, again, relates His\r\ngeneration as a man, saying, “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ,\r\nthe son of David, the son of Abraham” [Matt. 1:1]; and “The birth of Jesus\r\nChrist was on this wise” [Matt. 1:18]. This, then, is the gospel of His\r\nhumanity; for which reason the character of a humble and meek man is kept\r\nup through the whole gospel. Mark, on the other hand, commences with\r\nreference to the prophetical Spirit who comes down from on high to men,\r\nsaying, “The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in\r\nIsaiah the prophet,” pointing to the winged aspect of the Gospel, and on\r\nthis account he makes a compendious and brief narrative, for such is the\r\nprophetical character. And the Word of God himself had intercourse with\r\nthe patriarchs, before Moses, in accordance with His divinity and glory;\r\nbut for those under the Law He instituted a sacerdotal and liturgical\r\nservice. Afterward, having been made man for us, He sent the gift of the\r\nheavenly Spirit over all the earth, to protect it with His wings. Such,\r\nthen, was the course followed by the Son of God, and such, also, were the\r\nforms of the living creatures; and such as was the form of the living\r\ncreatures, such, also, was the character of the Gospel. For the living\r\ncreatures are quadriform, and the Gospel is quadriform, as is also the\r\ncourse followed by our Lord. For this reason four principal covenants were\r\ngiven mankind: one prior to the Deluge, under Adam; the second after the\r\nDeluge, under Noah; the third was the giving of the law under Moses; the\r\nfourth is that which renovates man and sums up all things in itself by\r\nmeans of the Gospel, raising and bearing men upon its wings into the\r\nheavenly kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Tertullian, _Adv. Marcion._, IV, 5. (MSL, 2:395.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tertullian’s work against Marcion belongs to the first decade of\r\n    the third century; see above, § 23, _b_. In the following passage\r\n    he combines the argument from the apostolic churches with the\r\n    authority of the apostolic witness. This is the special importance\r\n    of the reference to the connection of St. Mark’s Gospel with St.\r\n    Peter, and is an application of the principle that the authority\r\n    of a book in the Church rested upon its apostolic origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it is evidently true that what is earlier is more true, that what is\r\nearlier is what is from the beginning, that what is from the beginning is\r\nfrom the Apostles, it will be equally evidently true that what is handed\r\ndown from the Apostles is what has been a sacred deposit in the churches\r\nof the Apostles. Let us see what milk the Corinthians drank from Paul; to\r\nwhat rule the Galatians were brought for correction; what the Philippians,\r\nthe Thessalonians, the Ephesians, read; what the Romans near by also say,\r\nto whom Peter and Paul bequeathed the Gospel even sealed with their own\r\nblood. We have also John’s nursling churches. For, although Marcion\r\nrejects his Apocalypse, the order of bishops, when traced to their origin,\r\nwill rest on John as their author. Likewise the noble lineage of the other\r\nchurches is recognized. I say, therefore, that in them, and not only in\r\nthe apostolic churches, but in all those which are united with them in the\r\nfellowship of the mystery [_sacramenti_], that Gospel of Luke, which we\r\nare defending with all our might [_cf._ § 23], has stood its ground from\r\nits very first publication; whereas Marcion’s gospel is not known to most\r\npeople, and to none whatever is it known without being condemned. Of\r\ncourse it has its churches, but they are its own; they are as late as they\r\nare spurious. Should you want to know their origins, you will more easily\r\ndiscover apostasy in it than apostolicity, with Marcion, forsooth, as\r\ntheir founder or some one of Marcion’s swarm. Even wasps make combs; so,\r\nalso, these Marcionites make churches. The same authority of the apostolic\r\nchurches will afford evidence to other gospels, also, which we possess\r\nequally through their means and according to their usage—I mean the Gospel\r\nof John and the Gospel of Matthew, but that which Mark published may be\r\naffirmed to be Peter’s, whose interpreter Mark was. For even the Digest of\r\nLuke men usually ascribe to Paul. And it may well seem that the works\r\nwhich disciples publish belong to their masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 29. The Apostles’ Creed\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the second century there were current in the Church brief\r\nconfessions of faith which had already been in use from a time in the\r\nremoter past as summaries of the apostolic faith. They were naturally\r\nattributed to the Apostles themselves, although they seem to have varied\r\nin many details. They were used principally in baptism, and were long kept\r\nsecret from the catechumen until just before that rite was administered.\r\nThey are preserved only in paraphrase, and can be reconstructed only by a\r\ncareful comparison of many texts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: See Hahn, _Bibliothek der Symbole und\r\n    Glaubensregeln der allen Kirche_, third ed., Breslau, 1897; _cf._\r\n    Mirbt, n. 16, 16 _a_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Irenæus, _Adv. Haer._, 1, 10. (MSG, 7:549 _f._)\r\n\r\n\r\n    For Irenæus, _v. supra_, § 3, _a_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church, though dispersed through the whole world to the ends of the\r\nearth, has received from the Apostles and their disciples the faith: In\r\none God, the Father Almighty, who made the heaven and the earth and the\r\nseas, and all that in them is; And in one Christ Jesus, the Son of God,\r\nwho was incarnate for our salvation; And in the Holy Ghost, who through\r\nthe prophets preached the dispensations and the advents, and the birth\r\nfrom the Virgin, and the passion, and the resurrection from the dead, and\r\nthe bodily assumption into the heavens of the beloved Christ Jesus our\r\nLord, and His appearing from the heavens in the glory of the Father, in\r\norder to sum up all things under one head [_cf._ Ephes. 1:10], and to\r\nraise up all flesh of all mankind, that to Christ Jesus, our Lord and God\r\nand Saviour and King, every knee of those that are in heaven and on earth\r\nand under the earth should bow [_cf._ Phil. 2:11], according to the good\r\npleasure of the Father invisible, and that every tongue should confess\r\nHim, and that He may execute righteous judgment on all; sending into\r\neternal fire the spiritual powers of wickedness and the angels who\r\ntransgressed and apostatized, and the godless and unrighteous and lawless\r\nand blasphemous among men, but granting life and immortality and eternal\r\nglory to the righteous and holy, who have both kept the commandments and\r\ncontinued in His love, some from the beginning, some from their\r\nconversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, III, 4. (MSG, 7:855.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following form of the creed more closely resembles the\r\n    traditional Apostles’ Creed. With it compare the paraphrase in\r\n    Irenæus. _op. cit._, IV, 33:7.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Apostles had not left us the Scriptures, would it not be necessary\r\nto follow the order of tradition which they handed down to those to whom\r\nthey committed the churches? To this order many nations of the barbarians\r\ngave assent, of those who believe in Christ, having salvation written in\r\ntheir hearts by the Spirit without paper and ink, and guarding diligently\r\nthe ancient tradition: Believing in one God, Maker of heaven and earth,\r\nand all that is in them; through Jesus Christ, the Son of God; who,\r\nbecause of His astounding love toward His creatures, sustained the birth\r\nof the Virgin, Himself uniting man to God, and suffered under Pontius\r\nPilate, and rising again was received in brightness, and shall come again\r\nin glory as the Saviour of those who are saved and the judge of those who\r\nare judged, and sending into eternal fire the perverters of the truth and\r\ndespisers of His Father and His coming.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Tertullian, _De Virginibus Velandis_, 1. (MSL, 2:937).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tertullian gives various paraphrases of the creed. The three most\r\n    important are the following and _d_, _e_. The date of the work _De\r\n    Virginibus Velandis_ is about 211, and belongs to his Montanist\r\n    period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rule of Faith is altogether one, sole, immovable, and\r\nirreformable—namely, of believing in one God the Almighty, the Maker of\r\nthe world; and His Son, Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, crucified\r\nunder Pontius Pilate, on the third day raised again from the dead,\r\nreceived in the heavens, sitting now at the right hand of the Father,\r\ncoming to judge the quick and the dead, also through the resurrection of\r\nthe flesh.(53)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Tertullian, _Adv. Praxean_, 2. (MSL, 2:156.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The work of Tertullian against Praxeas is one of his latest works,\r\n    and is especially important as developing the doctrine of the\r\n    Trinity as opposed to the Patripassianism of Praxeas. To this\r\n    theory of Praxeas, Tertullian refers in the opening sentence of\r\n    the following extract, quoting the position of Praxeas. See below,\r\n    § 40, _b_.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Therefore after a time the Father was born, and the Father suffered, He\r\nhimself God, the omnipotent Lord, Jesus Christ was preached.” But as for\r\nus always, and now more, as better instructed by the Paraclete, the Leader\r\ninto all truth: We believe one God; but under this dispensation which we\r\ncall the economy there is the Son of the only God, his Word [_Sermo_] who\r\nproceeded from Him, through whom all things were made, and without whom\r\nnothing was made. This One was sent by the Father into the Virgin, and was\r\nborn of her, Man and God, the Son of Man and the Son of God, and called\r\nJesus Christ; He suffered, He died and was buried, according to the\r\nScriptures; and raised again by the Father, and taken up into the heavens,\r\nand He sits at the right hand of the Father; He shall come again to judge\r\nthe quick and the dead: and He thence did send, according to His promise,\r\nfrom the Father, the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, the Sanctifier of the\r\nfaith of those who believe in the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.\r\nThat this rule has come down from the beginning, even before any of the\r\nearlier heresies, much more before Praxeas, who is of yesterday, the\r\nlateness of date of all heresies proves, as also the novelties of Praxeas,\r\na pretender of yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Tertullian, _De Præscriptione_, 13. (MSL, 2:30.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rule of Faith is … namely, that by which it is believed: That there is\r\nonly one God, and no other besides the Maker of the world, who produced\r\nthe universe out of nothing, through His Word [Verbum], sent forth first\r\nof all; that this Word, called His Son, was seen in the name of God in\r\nvarious ways by the patriarchs, and always heard in the prophets, at last\r\nwas sent down from the Spirit and power of God the Father, into the Virgin\r\nMary, was made flesh in her womb, and born of her, lived as Jesus Christ;\r\nthat thereupon He preached the new law and the new promise of the kingdom\r\nof the heavens; wrought miracles; was fastened to the cross; rose again\r\nthe third day; was caught up into the heavens; and sat down at the right\r\nhand of the Father; He sent in His place the power of the Holy Ghost, to\r\nlead the believers; He will come again with glory to take the saints into\r\nthe enjoyment of eternal life and the celestial promises, and to judge the\r\nwicked with perpetual fire, with the restoration of the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 30. Later Gnosticism\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Gnosticism was expelled from the Church as it perfected its\r\norganization and institutions on the basis of the episcopate, the Canon of\r\nScripture, and the creeds, outside the Catholic Church, or the Church as\r\nthus organized, Gnosticism existed for centuries, though rapidly declining\r\nin the third century. The strength of the movement was still further\r\ndiminished by loss of many adherents to Manichæanism (_v._ § 54), which\r\nhad much in common with Gnosticism. The persistence of these sects,\r\ntogether with various later heresies, in spite of the very stringent laws\r\nof the Empire against them (_v._ § 73) should prevent any hasty\r\nconclusions as to the unity of the faith and the absence of sects in the\r\npatristic age. Unity can be found only by overlooking those outside the\r\nunity of the largest body of Christians, and agreement by ignoring those\r\nwho differed from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodoret of Cyrus, _Epistulæ 81_, 145. (MSG, 83:1259, 1383.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ep. 81 was written to the Consul Nonus, A. D. 445. Ep. 145 was\r\n    written to the monks of Constantinople, A. D. 450.\r\n\r\n\r\nEp. 81. To every one else every city lies open, and that not only to the\r\nfollowers of Arius and Eunomius, but to Manichæans and Marcionites, and to\r\nthose suffering from the disease of Valentinus and Montanus, yes, and even\r\nto pagans and Jews; but I, the foremost champion of the teaching of the\r\nGospel, am excluded from every city.… I led eight villages of Marcionites\r\nwith their surrounding country into the way of truth, another full of\r\nEunomians and another of Arians I brought to the light of divine\r\nknowledge, and, by God’s grace, not a tare of heresy was left among us.\r\n\r\nEp. 145. I do indeed sorrow and lament that I am compelled by the attacks\r\nof fever to adduce against men, supposed to be of one and the same faith\r\nwith myself, the arguments which I have already urged against the victims\r\nof the plague of Marcion, of whom, by God’s grace, I have converted more\r\nthan ten thousand and brought them to holy baptism.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 31. The Results of the Crisis\r\n\r\n\r\nThe internal crisis, or the conflict with heresy, led the Church to\r\nperfect its organization, and, as a result, the foundation was laid for\r\nsuch a development of the episcopate that the Church was recognized as\r\nbased upon an order of bishops receiving their powers in succession from\r\nthe Apostles. Just what those powers were and how they were transmitted\r\nwere matters left to a later age to determine. (_V. infra_, §§ 50, 51.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, IV, 26:2, 5. (MSG, 7:1053.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    That Irenæus, writing about 175, could appeal to the episcopal\r\n    succession as commonly recognized and admitted, and use it as a\r\n    basis of unity for the Church, is generally regarded as evidence\r\n    of the existence of a wide-spread episcopal organization at an\r\n    early date in the second century. Possibly the connection of\r\n    Irenæus with Asia Minor, where the episcopal organization\r\n    admittedly was earliest, diminishes the force of the argument. The\r\n    reference to the “charisma of truth,” which the bishops were said\r\n    to possess, was to furnish later a theoretical basis for the\r\n    authority of bishops assembled in council.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 2. Wherefore it is incumbent to obey the presbyters who are in the\r\nChurch, those who, as I have shown, possess the succession from the\r\nApostles; those who together with the succession of the episcopate have\r\nreceived the certain gift [charisma] of the truth according to the good\r\npleasure of the Father; but also to hold in suspicion others who depart\r\nfrom the primitive succession and assemble themselves together in any\r\nplace whatsoever.…\r\n\r\nCh. 5. Such presbyters does the Church nourish, of whom also the prophet\r\nsays: “I will give thy rulers in peace, and thy bishops in righteousness”\r\n[_cf._ Is. 60:17]. Of whom also the Lord did declare: “Who, then, shall be\r\na faithful steward, good and wise, whom the Lord sets over His household,\r\nto give them their meat in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his\r\nLord when he cometh shall find so doing” [Matt. 24:45 _f._]. Paul, then,\r\nteaching us where one may find such, says: “God hath placed in the Church,\r\nfirst, Apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers” [I Cor. 12:28].\r\nWhere, then, the gifts of the Lord have been placed there we are to learn\r\nthe truth; namely, from those who possess the succession of the Church\r\nfrom the Apostles, and among whom exists that which is sound and blameless\r\nin conduct, as well as that which is unadulterated and incorrupt in\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Tertullian, _De Præscriptione_, 32. (MSL, 2:52.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In Tertullian’s statement as to the necessity of apostolic\r\n    succession, the language is more precise than in Irenæus’s. Bishop\r\n    and presbyter are not used as interchangeable terms, as would\r\n    appear in the passage in Irenæus. The whole is given a more legal\r\n    turn, as was in harmony with the writer’s legal mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if there be any heresies bold enough to plant themselves in the midst\r\nof the apostolic age, that they may thereby seem to have been handed down\r\nfrom the Apostles, because they were in the time of the Apostles, we can\r\nsay: Let them produce the originals of their churches; let them unfold the\r\nroll of their bishops, running down in due succession from the beginning\r\nin such manner that that first bishop of theirs shall be able to show for\r\nhis ordainer or predecessor some one of the Apostles or of apostolic men—a\r\nman, moreover, who continued steadfast with the Apostles. For in this\r\nmanner the apostolic churches transmit their registers; as the church of\r\nSmyrna, which records that Polycarp was placed therein by John; as also\r\nthe church of Rome, which makes Clement to have been ordained in like\r\nmanner by Peter. In exactly the same way the other churches likewise\r\nexhibit their several worthies, whom, as having been appointed to their\r\nepiscopal places by the Apostles, they regard as transmitters of the\r\napostolic seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. The Beginnings Of Catholic Theology\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theology of the Church, as distinguished from the current traditional\r\ntheology, was the statement of the beliefs commonly held by Christians but\r\nexpressed in the more precise and scientific language of current\r\nphilosophy, the co-ordination of those beliefs as so stated together with\r\ntheir necessary consequences, and their proof by reference to Holy\r\nScripture and reason. In this attempt to build up a body of reasoned\r\nreligious ideas there were two lines of thought or interpretation of the\r\ncommon Christianity already distinguished by the middle of the second\r\ncentury, and destined to hold a permanent place in the Church. These were\r\nthe apologetic conception of Christianity as primarily a revealed\r\nphilosophy (§ 32), and the so-called Asia Minor school of theology, with\r\nits conception of Christianity as primarily salvation from sin and\r\ncorruptibility (§ 33). In both lines of interpretation the Incarnation\r\nplayed an essential part: in the apologetic as insuring the truth of the\r\nrevealed philosophy, in the Asia Minor theology as imparting to\r\ncorruptible man the divine incorruptibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 32. The Apologetic Conception of Christianity\r\n\r\n\r\nChristianity was regarded as a revealed philosophy by the apologists. This\r\nthey considered under three principal aspects: knowledge, or a revelation\r\nof the divine nature; a new law, or a code of morals given by Christ; and\r\nlife, or future rewards for the observance of the new law that had been\r\ngiven. The foundation of all was laid in the doctrine of the Logos (_A_),\r\nwhich involved, as a consequence, some theory of the relation of the\r\nresulting distinctions in the divine nature to the primary conviction of\r\nthe unity of God, or some doctrine of the Trinity (_B_). As a result of\r\nthe new law given, moralism was inevitable, whereby a man by his efforts\r\nearned everlasting life (_C_). The proof that Jesus was the incarnate\r\nLogos was drawn from the fulfilment of Hebrew prophecy (_D_). It should be\r\nremembered that the apologists influenced later theology by their actual\r\nwritings, and not by unexpressed and undeveloped opinions which they held\r\nas a part of the common tradition and the Christianity of the Gentile\r\nChurch. Whatever they might have held in addition to their primary\r\ncontentions had little or no effect, however valuable it may be for modern\r\nstudents, and the conviction that Christianity was essentially a revealed\r\nphilosophy became current, especially in the East, finding its most\r\npowerful expression in the Alexandrian school. (_V. infra_, § 43.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) The Logos Doctrine\r\n\r\n\r\nAs stated by the apologists, the Logos doctrine not only furnished a\r\nvaluable line of defence for Christianity (_v. supra_, § 20), but also\r\ngave theologians a useful formula for stating the relation of the divine\r\nelement in Christ to God. That divine element was the Divine Word or\r\nReason (Logos). It is characteristic of the doctrine of the Logos as held\r\nby the early apologists that, although they make the Word, or Logos,\r\npersonal and distinguish Him from God the Father, yet that Word does not\r\nbecome personally distinguished from the source of His being until, and in\r\nconnection with, the creation of the world. Hence there arose the\r\ndistinction between the _Logos endiathetos_, or as yet within the being of\r\nthe Father, and the _Logos prophorikos_, or as proceeding forth and\r\nbecoming a distinct person. Here is, at any rate, a marked advance upon\r\nthe speculation of Philo, by whom the Logos is not regarded as distinctly\r\npersonal.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Justin Martyr, _Apol._, I, 46. (MSG, 6:398.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In addition to the following passage from Justin Martyr, see\r\n    above, § 20, for a longer statement to much the same effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been taught that Christ is the first-born of God, and we have\r\ndeclared above that He is the Word of whom every race of men were\r\npartakers; and those who lived reasonably are Christians even though they\r\nhave been thought atheists; as among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus,\r\nand men like them; and among the barbarians, Abraham and Ananias, Azarias,\r\nand Missael [the “three holy children,” companions of Daniel, see LXX,\r\nDan. 3:23 _ff._], and Elias [_i.e._, Elijah], and many others whose\r\nactions and names we now decline to recount because we know that it would\r\nbe tedious.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Theophilus, _Ad Autolycum_, II, 10, 22. (MSG, 6:398.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Theophilus was the sixth bishop of Antioch, from 169 until after\r\n    180. His apology, consisting of three books addressed to an\r\n    otherwise unknown Autolycus, has alone been preserved of his\r\n    works. Fragments attributed to him are of very doubtful\r\n    authenticity. The date of the third book must be subsequent to the\r\n    death of Marcus Aurelius, March 17, 180, which is mentioned. The\r\n    first and second books may be somewhat earlier. The distinction\r\n    made in the following between the _Logos endiathetos_ and the\r\n    _Logos prophorikos_ was subsequently dropped by theologians.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 10. God, then, having His own Logos internal [_endiatheton_] within\r\nHis own bowels, begat Him, emitting Him along with His own wisdom before\r\nall things.\r\n\r\nCh. 22. What else is this voice but the Word of God, who is also His Son?\r\nNot as the poets and writers of myths talk of the sons of the gods\r\nbegotten from intercourse with women, but as the Truth expounds, the Word\r\nthat always exists, residing within [_endiatheton_] the heart of God. For\r\nbefore anything came into existence He had Him for His counsellor, being\r\nHis own mind and thought. But when God wished to make all that He had\r\ndetermined on, He begat this Word proceeding forth [_prophorikon_], the\r\nfirst-born of all creation, not being Himself emptied of the Word [_i.e._,\r\nbeing without reason], but having begotten Reason and always conversing\r\nwith His reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B) The Doctrine of the Trinity\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the Trinity followed naturally from the doctrine of the\r\nLogos. The fuller discussion belongs to the Monarchian controversies. It\r\nis considered here as a position resulting from the general position taken\r\nby the apologists. (_V. infra_, § 40.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Theophilus, _Ad Autolycum_, II, 15. (MSG, 6:1078.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following passage is probably the earliest in which the word\r\n    Trinity, or Trias, is applied to the relation of Father, Son, and\r\n    Holy Ghost. It is usual in Greek theology to use the word Trias as\r\n    equivalent to the Latin term Trinity. _Cf._ Tertullian, _Adv.\r\n    Praxean_, 2, for first use of the term Trinity in Latin theology.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn like manner, also, the three days, which were before the luminaries(54)\r\nare types of the Trinity (Trias) of God, and His Word, and His Wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Athenagoras, _Supplicatio_, 10, 12. (MSG, 6:910, 914.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Athenagoras, one of the ablest of the apologists, was, like Justin\r\n    Martyr and several others, a philosopher before he became a\r\n    Christian. His apology, known as _Supplicatio_, or _Legatio pro\r\n    Christianis_, is his most important work. Its date is probably\r\n    177, as it is addressed to the Emperors Marcus Aurelius and\r\n    Commodus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 10. If it occurs to you to inquire what is meant by the Son, I will\r\nbriefly state that He is the first product of the Father, not as having\r\nbeen brought into existence (for from the beginning God, who is the\r\neternal mind [_Nous_], had the Logos in Himself, being eternally\r\nreasonable [λογικός]), but inasmuch as He came forth to be idea and\r\nenergizing power of all material things, which lay like a nature without\r\nattributes, and an inactive earth, the grosser particles being mixed up\r\nwith the lighter. The prophetic Spirit also agrees with our statements:\r\n“The Lord, it says, created me the beginning of His ways to His works.”\r\nThe Holy Spirit himself, also, which operates in the prophets we say is an\r\neffluence of God, flowing from Him and returning back again as a beam of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nCh. 12. Are, then, those who consider life to be this, “Let us eat and\r\ndrink, for to-morrow we die” [_cf._ I Cor. 15:32], and who regard death as\r\na deep sleep and forgetfulness [_cf._ Hom., _Iliad_, XVI. 672], to be\r\nregarded as living piously? But men who reckon the present life as of very\r\nsmall worth indeed, and are led by this one thing along—that they know God\r\nand with Him His Logos, what is the oneness of the Son with the Father,\r\nwhat the communion of the Father with the Son, what is the Spirit, and\r\nwhat is the unity of these and their distinction, the Spirit, the Son, and\r\nthe Father—and who know that the life for which we look is far better than\r\ncan be described in word, provided we arrive at it pure from all\r\nwrong-doing, and who, moreover, carry our benevolence to such an extent\r\nthat we not only love our friends … shall we, I say, when such we are and\r\nwhen we thus live that we may escape condemnation, not be regarded as\r\nliving piously?\r\n\r\n\r\n(C) Moralistic Christianity\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moralistic conception of Christianity, _i.e._, the view of\r\nChristianity as primarily a moral code by the observance of which eternal\r\nlife was won, remained fixed in Christian thought along with the\r\nphilosophical conception of the faith as formulated by the apologists.\r\nThis moralism was the opposite pole to the conceptions of the Asia Minor\r\nschool, the Augustinian theology, and the whole mystical conception of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    For additional source material, see above, § 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheophilus, _Ad Autolycum_, II, 27. (MSG, 6:27.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGod made man free and with power over himself. That [death], man brought\r\nupon himself through carelessness and disobedience, this [life], God\r\nvouchsafes to him as a gift through His own love for man and pity when men\r\nobey Him. For as man, disobeying, drew death upon himself, so, obeying the\r\nwill of God, he who desires is able to procure for himself everlasting\r\nlife. For God has given us a law and holy commandments; and every one who\r\nkeeps these can be saved, and obtaining the resurrection, can inherit\r\nincorruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n(D) Argument from Hebrew Prophecy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal to the fulfilment of Hebrew prophecy was the main argument of\r\nthe apologists for the divine character of the mission of Christ. The\r\nexegesis of the prophetic writings was in the spirit of the times. Hebrew\r\nprophecy was also regarded as the source of all knowledge of God outside\r\nof Israel. The theory that the Greeks and other nations borrowed was\r\nemployed to show the connection; in this the apologists followed Philo\r\nJudæus. No attempt was made either by them or by Clement of Alexandria to\r\nremove the inconsistency of this theory of borrowing with the doctrine of\r\nthe Logos; see above, under “Logos Doctrine;” also § 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nJustin Martyr, _Apol._, I, 30, 44. (MSG, 6:374, 394.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Justin Martyr, _Dial. c. Tryph._,\r\n    _passim_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 30. But lest any one should say in opposition to us: What should\r\nprevent that He whom we call Christ, being a man born of men, performed\r\nwhat we call His mighty works by magical art, and by this appeared to be\r\nthe Son of God? We will offer proof, not trusting to mere assertions, but\r\nbeing of necessity persuaded by those who prophesied of Him before these\r\nthings came to pass.\r\n\r\nCh. 44. Whatever both philosophers and poets have said concerning the\r\nimmortality of the soul, or punishments after death, or contemplation of\r\nthings heavenly, or doctrines of the like kind, they have received such\r\nsuggestions from the prophets as have enabled them to understand and\r\ninterpret these things. And hence there seem to be seeds of truth among\r\nall men.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 33. The Asia Minor Conception of Christianity\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Asia Minor school regarded Christianity primarily as redemption,\r\nsalvation, the imparting of new power, life, and incorruptibility by union\r\nwith divinity in the Incarnation. Its leading representative was Irenæus,\r\na native of Asia Minor, but many of his leading ideas had been anticipated\r\nby Ignatius of Antioch, and they were shared by many others.\r\n\r\nThe theology of Irenæus influenced Tertullian to some extent, but its\r\nessential points were reproduced by Athanasius, who was directly indebted\r\nto Irenæus, and through him it superseded in the Neo-Alexandrian school\r\nthe tradition derived through Origen and Clement from the apologists.\r\nCharacteristic features of the Asia Minor theology are the place assigned\r\nto the Incarnation as itself effecting redemption or salvation, the idea\r\nof recapitulation whereby Christ becomes the head of a new race of\r\nredeemed men, a second Adam, and of the eucharist as imparting the\r\nincorruptibility of Christ’s immortal flesh which is received by the\r\nfaithful.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, V, 1. (MSG, 7:1119.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The position of the Incarnation in the system and its relation to\r\n    redemption.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no other way could we have learned the things of God, if our Master,\r\nexisting previously as the Word, had not been made man. For no one else\r\ncould have declared to us the truths of the Father than the Father’s own\r\nWord. For who else knew the mind of the Lord or who else has been his\r\ncounsellor? [Rom. 11:34]. Nor again in any other way could we have learned\r\nexcept by seeing our Master with our eyes and hearing His voice with our\r\nears; that so as imitators of His acts and doers of His words we might\r\nhave fellowship with Him and receive of the fulness of Him who is perfect\r\nand who was before all creation. All this we have been made in these\r\nlatter days by Him who only is supremely good and who has the gift of\r\nincorruptibility; inasmuch as we are conformed to His likeness and\r\npredestinated to become what we never were before, according to the\r\nforeknowledge of the Father, made a first-fruit of His workmanship, we\r\nhave, therefore, received all this at the foreordained season, according\r\nto the dispensation of the Word, who is perfect in all things. For He, who\r\nis the mighty Word and very man, redeeming us by His blood in a reasonable\r\nmanner, gave Himself as a ransom for those who had been led into\r\ncaptivity. And since apostasy tyrannized over us unjustly, for though by\r\nnature we were God’s possession, it yet alienated us contrary to nature,\r\nmaking us its own disciples, the Word of God, powerful in all things and\r\nconstant in His justice, dealt justly even with apostasy itself, redeeming\r\nfrom it what was His own property. Not by force, the way in which the\r\napostasy had originally gained its mastery over us, greedily grasping at\r\nthat which was not its own; but by moral force [_secundum suadelam_] as\r\nbecame God, by persuasion and not by force, regaining what He wished; so\r\nthat justice might not be violated and God’s ancient handiwork might not\r\nperish. Therefore, since by His own blood the Lord redeemed us and gave\r\nHis soul for our soul, and His flesh for our flesh, and shed on us His\r\nFather’s spirit to unite and join us in communion God and man, bringing\r\nGod down to men by the descent of the Spirit, and raising up man to God by\r\nHis incarnation, and by a firm and true promise giving us at His advent\r\nincorruptibility by communion with Him, and thus all the errors of the\r\nheretics are destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Irenæus. _Adv. Hær._, III. 18:1, 7. (MSG, 6:932, 937.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following is a statement by Irenæus of his doctrine of\r\n    recapitulation, which combines the idea of the second Adam of Paul\r\n    and the Johannine theology.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 1. Since it has been clearly demonstrated that the Word, who existed\r\nin the beginning with God, and by whom all things were made, who also was\r\npresent with the human race, was in these last days, according to the time\r\nappointed by the Father, united to His own workmanship, having been made a\r\nman liable to suffering, every objection is set aside of those who say:\r\n“If Christ was born at that time, He did not exist before that time.” For\r\nI have shown that the Son of God did not then begin to be, since He\r\nexisted with His Father always; but when He was incarnate, and was made\r\nman, He commenced afresh [_in seipso recapitulavit_] the long line of\r\nhuman beings, and furnished us in a brief and comprehensive manner with\r\nsalvation; so that what we had lost in Adam—namely, to be according to the\r\nimage and likeness of God—that we might recover in Christ Jesus.\r\n\r\nCh. 7. He caused human nature to cleave to and to become one with God, as\r\nwe have said. For if man had not overcome the adversary of man, the enemy\r\nwould not have been legitimately overcome. And again, if God had not given\r\nsalvation, we could not have had it securely. And if man had not been\r\nunited to God, he could never have become a partaker of incorruptibility.\r\nFor it was incumbent upon the Mediator between God and man, by His\r\nrelationship to both, to bring about a friendship and concord, and to\r\npresent man to God and to reveal God to man. For in what way could we be\r\npartakers of the adoption of sons, if we had not received from Him,\r\nthrough the Son, that fellowship which refers to Himself, if the Word,\r\nhaving been made flesh, had not entered into communion with us? Wherefore\r\nHe passed also through every stage of life restoring to all communion with\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, IV, 18:5. (MSG, 6:1027 _f._)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The conception of redemption as the imparting of incorruptibility\r\n    connected itself easily with the doctrine of the eucharist, which\r\n    had been called by Ignatius of Antioch “the medicine of\r\n    immortality” (_v. supra_, § 12). With this passage compare\r\n    Irenæus, _Adv. Hær._, IV, 17:5.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can they say that the flesh which is nourished with the body of the\r\nLord and with His blood goes to corruption and does not partake of life?\r\nLet them, therefore, either alter their opinion or cease from offering the\r\nthings mentioned. But our opinion is in accordance with the eucharist, and\r\nthe eucharist, in turn, establishes our opinion. For we offer to Him His\r\nown, announcing consistently the fellowship and union of the flesh and the\r\nSpirit. For as the bread which is produced from the earth when it receives\r\nthe invocation of God is no longer common bread, but the eucharist,\r\nconsisting of two realities, earthly and heavenly, so, also, our bodies,\r\nwhen they receive the eucharist, are no longer corruptible, having the\r\nhope of the resurrection unto eternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriod IV. The Age Of The Consolidation Of The Church: 200 to 324 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fourth period of the Church under the heathen Empire, or the period\r\nof the consolidation of the Church, the number of Christians increased so\r\nrapidly that the relation of the Roman State to the Church became a matter\r\nof the gravest importance (ch. 1). During a period of comparative peace\r\nand prosperity the Church developed its doctrinal system and its\r\nconstitution (ch. 2). Although the school of Asia Minor became isolated\r\nand temporarily ceased to affect the bulk of the Church elsewhere, the\r\nschool of the apologists was brilliantly continued at Alexandria under\r\nClement and Origen, and later under Origen at Cæsarea in Palestine.\r\nMeanwhile the foundations were laid in North Africa for a distinctive type\r\nof Western theology, inaugurated by Tertullian and developed by Cyprian.\r\nAfter years of alternating favor and local persecutions, the first general\r\npersecution (ch. 3) broke upon the Church, rudely testing its organization\r\nand ultimately strengthening and furthering its tendencies toward a\r\nstrictly hierarchical constitution. In the long period of peace that\r\nfollowed (ch. 4), the discussions that had arisen within the Church as to\r\nthe relation of the divine unity to the divinity of Christ reached a\r\ntemporary conclusion, the cultus was elaborated and assumed the essentials\r\nof its permanent form, and the episcopate was made supreme over rival\r\nauthorities within the Church, becoming at once the expression and organ\r\nof ecclesiastical unity. At the same time new problems arose; within the\r\nChurch there was the appearance of an organized asceticism which appeared\r\nfor a time to be a rival to the Church’s system, and outside the Church\r\nthe appearance of a hostile rival in the rapidly spreading Manichæan\r\nsystem, in which was revived, in a better organized and therefore more\r\ndangerous form, the expelled Gnosticism. The period ends with the last\r\ngeneral persecution (ch. 5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. The Political And Religious Conditions Of The Empire\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accession of Septimius Severus, A. D. 193, marks a change in the\r\ncondition of the Empire. It was becoming more harassed by frontier wars,\r\nnot always waged successfully. Barbarians were gradually settling within\r\nthe Empire. The emperors themselves were no longer Romans or Italians.\r\nProvincials, some not even of the Latin race, assumed the imperial\r\ndignity. But it was a period in which the Roman law was in its most\r\nflourishing and brilliant stage, under such men as Papinian, Ulpian, and\r\nothers second only to these masters. Stoic cosmopolitanism made for wider\r\nconceptions of law and a deeper sense of human solidarity. The Christian\r\nChurch, however, profited little by this (§ 34) until, in the religious\r\nsyncretism which became fashionable in the highest circles, it was favored\r\nby even the imperial family along with other Oriental religions (§ 35).\r\nThe varying fortunes of the emperors necessarily affected the Church (§\r\n36), though, on the whole, there was little suffering, and the Church\r\nspread rapidly, and in many parts of the Empire became a powerful\r\norganization (§ 37), with which the State would soon have to reckon.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 34. State and Church under Septimius Severus and Caracalla\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Christians were at first favored by Septimius Severus, they were\r\nstill liable to the severe laws against secret societies, and the policy\r\nof Septimius was later to enforce these laws. The Christians tried to\r\nescape the penalties prescribed against such societies by taking the form\r\nof friendly societies which were expressly tolerated by the law.\r\nNevertheless, numerous cases are to be found in various parts of the\r\nEmpire in which Christians were put to death under the law. Yet the number\r\nof martyrs before the general persecution of Decius in the middle of the\r\ncentury was relatively small. The position of Christians was not\r\nmaterially affected by the constitution of Caracalla conferring Roman\r\ncitizenship on all free inhabitants of the Empire, and the constitution\r\nseems to have been merely a fiscal measure which laid additional burdens\r\nupon the provincials.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VI, 1-12.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Tertullian, _Ad Scapulam_, 4. (MSL, 1:781.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The account of Tertullian is generally accepted as substantially\r\n    correct. Scapula was chief magistrate of Carthage and, under the\r\n    circumstances, the author would not have indulged his tendency to\r\n    rhetorical embellishment. Furthermore, the book is written with\r\n    what was for Tertullian great moderation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many rulers, men more resolute and more cruel than you, have contrived\r\nto get quit of such causes—as Cincius Severus, who himself suggested the\r\nremedy at Thysdris, pointing out how Christians should answer that they\r\nmight be acquitted; as Vespronius Candidus, who acquitted a Christian on\r\nthe ground that to satisfy his fellow-citizens would create a riot; as\r\nAsper, who, in the case of a man who under slight torture had fallen, did\r\nnot compel him to offer sacrifice, having owned among the advocates and\r\nassessors of the court that he was annoyed at having to meddle with such a\r\ncase! Prudens, too, at once dismissed a Christian brought before him,\r\nperceiving from the indictment that it was a case of vexatious accusation;\r\ntearing the document in pieces, he refused, according to the imperial\r\ncommand, to hear him without the presence of his accuser. All this might\r\nbe officially brought under your notice, and by the very advocates, who\r\nthemselves are under obligations to Christians, although they cry out\r\nagainst us as it suits them. The clerk of one who was liable to be thrown\r\ndown by an evil spirit was set free; as was also a relative of another,\r\nand the little boy of a third. How many men of rank (not to mention common\r\npeople) have been cured of devils and of diseases! Even Severus himself,\r\nthe father of Antonine, was mindful of the Christians; for he sought out\r\nthe Christian Proclus, surnamed Torpacion, the steward of Euhodias, who\r\nonce had cured him by means of oil, and whom he kept in his palace till\r\nhis death. Antonine [Caracalla], too, was brought up on Christian\r\nmilk,(55) was intimately acquainted with this man. But Severus, knowing\r\nboth men and women of the highest rank to be of this sect, not only did\r\nnot injure them, but distinguished them with his testimony and restored\r\nthem to us openly from the raging populace.(56)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Laws Relating to Forbidden Societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Justinian, _Digest_, XLVII. 23:1.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following is a passage taken from the Institutes of Marcian,\r\n    Bk. III.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy princely commands it was prescribed to the governors of provinces that\r\nthey should not permit social clubs and that soldiers should not have\r\nsocieties in the camp. But it is permitted to the poor to collect a\r\nmonthly contribution, so long as they gather together only once in a\r\nmonth, lest under a pretext of this sort an unlawful society meet. And\r\nthat this should be allowed not only in the city, but also in Italy and\r\nthe provinces, the divine Severus ordered. But for the sake of religion\r\nthey are not forbidden to come together so long as they do nothing\r\ncontrary to the Senatus-consultum, by which unlawful societies are\r\nrestrained. It is furthermore not lawful to belong to more than one lawful\r\nsociety, as this was determined by the divine brothers [Caracalla and\r\nGeta]; and if any one is in two, it is ordered that it be necessary for\r\nhim to choose in which he prefers to be, and he shall receive from the\r\nsociety from which he resigns that which belongs to him proportionately of\r\nwhat there is of a common fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Justinian, _Digest_, I, 12:14.\r\n\r\n\r\n    From Ulpian’s treatise, _De officio Præfecti Urbi_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe divine Severus ordered that those who were accused of meeting in\r\nforbidden societies should be accused before the prefect of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Persecutions under Severus.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VI, 1. (MSG, 20:522.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following extract is important not only as a witness to the\r\n    fact of the execution of the laws against Christians in\r\n    Alexandria, but also to the extension of Christianity in the more\r\n    southern provinces of Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Severus began to persecute the churches, glorious testimonies were\r\ngiven everywhere by the athletes of religion. Especially numerous were\r\nthey in Alexandria, for thither, as to a more prominent theatre, athletes\r\nof God were sent from Egypt and all Thebais, according to their merit, and\r\nthey won crowns from God through their great patience under many tortures\r\nand every mode of death. Among these was Leonidas, said to be the father\r\nof Origen, who was beheaded while his son was still young.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Spartianus, _Vita Severi_, XVII. 1. (_Scriptores Historiæ Augustæ_. Ed.\r\nPeter, 1884; Preuschen, _Analecta_, I, 32.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The date of the following is A. D. 202.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe forbade, under heavy penalties, any to become Jews. He made the same\r\nregulation in regard to Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Tertullian. _Apol._, 39. (MSL, 1:534.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the following, Christian assemblies, or churches, are\r\n    represented as being a sort of friendly society, similar but\r\n    superior to those existing all over the Empire, common and\r\n    tolerated among the poorer members of society. The date of the\r\n    _Apology_ is 197.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough we have our treasure-chest, it is not made up of purchase money, as\r\nif our religion had its price. On the regular day in the month, or when\r\none prefers, each one makes a small donation; but only if it be his\r\npleasure, and only if he be able; for no one is compelled, but gives\r\nvoluntarily. These gifts are, as it were, piety’s deposit fund. For they\r\nare taken thence and spent, not on feasts and drinking-bouts, and\r\nthankless eating-houses, but to support and bury poor people, to supply\r\nthe wants of boys and girls destitute of means and parents, and of old\r\npersons confined to the house, likewise the shipwrecked, and if there\r\nhappen to be any in the mines, or banished to the islands, or shut up in\r\nthe prisons for nothing but their fidelity to the cause of God’s Church,\r\nthey become the nurslings of their confession. But it is mainly for such\r\nwork of love that many place a brand upon us. See, they say, how they love\r\none another!\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) _The Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas._ (MSL, 3:51.) (_Cf._ Knopf,\r\npp. 44-57.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The date of this martyrdom is A. D. 203. The _Passio SS. Perpetuæ\r\n    et Felicitatis_ has been attributed to Tertullian. It betrays\r\n    clear evidence of Montanist sympathies. It has even been thought\r\n    by some that the martyrs themselves were Montanists. At that date\r\n    probably not a few who sympathized with Montanism were still in\r\n    good standing in certain parts of the Church. At any rate, the day\r\n    of their commemoration has been from the middle of the fourth\r\n    century at Rome March 7. See Kirch, p. 323.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day of their victory dawned, and they proceeded from the prison into\r\nthe amphitheatre, as if to happiness, joyous and of brilliant\r\ncountenances; if, perchance, shrinking, it was with joy and not with fear.\r\nPerpetua followed with placid look, and with step and gait as a matron of\r\nChrist, beloved of God, casting down the lustre of her eyes from the gaze\r\nof all. Likewise Felicitas came, rejoicing that she had safely brought\r\nforth, so that she might fight with the beasts.… And when they were\r\nbrought to the gate, and were constrained to put on the clothing—the men\r\nthat of the priests of Saturn, and the women that of those who were\r\nconsecrated to Ceres—that noble-minded woman resisted even to the end with\r\nconstancy. For she said: “We have come thus far of our own accord, that\r\nour liberty might not be restrained. For this reason we have yielded our\r\nminds, that we might not do any such thing as this; we have agreed on this\r\nwith you.” Injustice acknowledged the justice; the tribune permitted that\r\nthey be brought in simply as they were. Perpetua sang psalms, already\r\ntreading under foot the head of the Egyptian [seen in a vision; see\r\npreceding chapters]; Revocatus and Saturninus and Saturus uttered\r\nthreatenings against the gazing people about this martyrdom. When they\r\ncame within sight of Hilarianus, by gesture and nod they began to say to\r\nHilarianus: “Thou judgest us, but God will judge thee.” At this the\r\nexasperated people demanded that they should be tormented with scourges as\r\nthey passed along the rank of the _venatores_. And they, indeed, rejoiced\r\nthat they should have incurred any one of their Lord’s passions.\r\n\r\nBut He who had said, “Ask and ye shall receive,” gave to them, when they\r\nasked, that death which each one had desired. For when they had been\r\ndiscoursing among themselves about their wish as to their martyrdom,\r\nSaturninus, indeed, had professed that he wished that he might be thrown\r\nto all the beasts; doubtless that he might wear a more glorious crown.\r\nTherefore, in the beginning of the exhibition he and Revocatus made trial\r\nof the leopard, and, moreover, upon the scaffold they were harassed by the\r\nbear. Saturus, however, held nothing in greater horror than a bear; but he\r\nthought he would be finished by one bite of a leopard. Therefore, when a\r\nwild boar was supplied, it was the huntsman who had supplied that boar,\r\nand not Saturus, who was gored by that same beast and who died the day\r\nafter the shows. Saturus only was drawn out; and when he had been bound on\r\nthe floor near to a bear, the bear would not come forth from his den. And\r\nso Saturus for the second time was recalled, unhurt.\r\n\r\nMoreover, for the young women the devil, rivalling their sex also in that\r\nof the beasts, prepared a very fierce cow, provided especially for that\r\npurpose contrary to custom. And so, stripped and clothed with nets, they\r\nwere led forth. The populace shuddered as they saw one young woman of\r\ndelicate frame, and another with breasts still dropping from her recent\r\nchildbirth. So, being recalled, they were unbound. Perpetua was first led\r\nin. She was tossed and fell on her loins; and when she saw her tunic torn\r\nfrom her side, she drew it over her as a veil for her thighs, mindful of\r\nher modesty rather than of her suffering. Then she was called for again,\r\nand bound up her dishevelled hair; for it was not becoming for a martyr to\r\nsuffer with dishevelled hair, lest she should appear to be mourning in her\r\nglory. She rose up, and when she saw Felicitas crushed she approached and\r\ngave her her hand and lifted her up. And both of them stood together; and\r\nthe brutality of the populace being appeased, they were recalled to the\r\nSanavivarian gate. Then Perpetua was received by a certain one who was\r\nstill a catechumen, Rusticus by name, who kept close to her; and she, as\r\nif roused from sleep, so deeply had she been in the Spirit and in an\r\necstasy, began to look around her and to say to the amazement of all: “I\r\ndo not know when we are to be led out to that cow.” Thus she said, and\r\nwhen she had heard what had already happened, she did not believe it until\r\nshe had perceived certain signs of injury in her own body and in her\r\ndress, and had recognized the catechumen. Afterward, causing that\r\ncatechumen and the brother to approach, she addressed them, saying: “Stand\r\nfast in the faith, and love one another, all of you, and be not offended\r\nat our sufferings.”\r\n\r\nThe same Saturus at the other entrance exhorted the soldier Prudens,\r\nsaying: “Assuredly here I am, as I have promised and foretold, for up to\r\nthis moment I have felt no beast. And now believe with your whole heart.\r\nLo, I am going forth to the leopard, and I shall be destroyed with one\r\nbite.” And immediately on the conclusion of the exhibition he was thrown\r\nto the leopard; and with one bite by it he was bathed with such a quantity\r\nof blood that the people shouted out to him, as he was returning, the\r\ntestimony of his second baptism: “Saved and washed, saved and washed.”\r\nManifestly he was assuredly saved who had been glorified in such a\r\nspectacle. Then to the soldier Prudens he said: “Farewell, and be mindful\r\nof my faith; and let not these things disturb, but confirm you.” And at\r\nthe same time he asked for a little ring from his finger, and returned it\r\nto him bathed in his wound, leaving to him an inherited token and memory\r\nof his blood. And then lifeless he was cast down with the rest, to be\r\nslaughtered in the usual place. And when the populace called for them into\r\nthe midst, that as the sword penetrated into their body they might make\r\ntheir eyes partners in the murder, they rose up of their own accord, and\r\ntransferred themselves whither the people wished; but they first kissed\r\none another, that they might consummate their martyrdom with the rites of\r\npeace. The rest, indeed, immovable and in silence, received the sword; and\r\nso did Saturus, who had also first ascended the ladder, and first gave up\r\nhis spirit, for he was waiting for Perpetua. But Perpetua, that she might\r\ntaste some pain, being pierced between the ribs, cried out loudly and she\r\nherself placed the wavering right hand of the youthful gladiator to her\r\nthroat. Possibly such a woman could not have been slain unless she herself\r\nhad willed it, because she was feared by the impure spirit.\r\n\r\nO most brave and blessed martyrs! O truly called and chosen unto the glory\r\nof our Lord Jesus Christ! Whoever magnifies, and honors, and adores Him,\r\nassuredly ought to read these examples for the edification of the Church,\r\nnot less than the ancient ones, so that new virtues also may testify that\r\none and the same Holy Spirit is always operating even until now, and God\r\nthe Father Omnipotent, and his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, whose is glory\r\nand infinite power forever and ever. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Origen, _Contra Celsum_, III, 8. (MSG, 11:930.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Origen is writing just before the first general persecution under\r\n    Decius about the middle of the century. He points out the\r\n    relatively small number of those suffering persecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to Christians, because they were taught not to avenge\r\nthemselves upon their enemies, and have thus observed laws of a mild and\r\nphilanthropic character; and because, although they were able, yet they\r\nwould not have made war even if they had received authority to do so; for\r\nthis cause they have obtained this from God: that He has always warred on\r\ntheir behalf, and at times has restrained those who rose up against them\r\nand who wished to destroy them. For in order to remind others, that seeing\r\na few engaged in a struggle in behalf of religion, they might also be\r\nbetter fitted to despise death, a few, at various times, and these easily\r\nnumbered, have endured death for the sake of the Christian religion; God\r\nnot permitting the whole nation [_i.e._, the Christians] to be\r\nexterminated, but desiring that it should continue, and that the whole\r\nworld should be filled with this salvation and the doctrines of religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Justinian, _Digest_, I, 5:17.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The edict of Caracalla (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus) conferring\r\n    Roman citizenship upon all free inhabitants of the Empire has not\r\n    been preserved. It is known only from a brief extract from the\r\n    twenty-second book of Ulpian’s work on the Prætorian Edict,\r\n    contained in the _Digest_ of Justinian.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who were in the Roman world were made Roman citizens by the\r\nconstitution of the Emperor Antoninus.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 35. Religious Syncretism in the Third Century\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the third century religious syncretism took two leading forms—the\r\nMithraic worship, which spread rapidly throughout the Empire, and the\r\nfashionable interest in novel religions fostered by the imperial court.\r\nMithraism was especially prevalent in the army, and at army posts have\r\nbeen found numerous remains of sanctuaries, inscriptions, etc. It was by\r\nfar the purest of the religions that invaded the Roman Empire, and drew\r\nits leading ideas from Persian sources. The fashionable court interest in\r\nnovel religions seems not to have amounted to much as a positive religious\r\nforce, which Mithraism certainly was, though on account of it Christianity\r\nwas protected and even patronized by the ladies of the imperial household.\r\nAmong the works produced by this interest was the _Life of Apollonius of\r\nTyana_, written by Philostratus at the command of the Empress Julia Domna.\r\nApollonius was a preacher or teacher of ethics and the Neo-Pythagorean\r\nphilosophy in the first century, _ob._ A. D. 97.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Philostratus, _Life of Apollonius_\r\n    (the latest English translation, by F. C. Conybeare, with Greek\r\n    text in the _Loeb Classical Library_, 1912).\r\n\r\n\r\nMithraic Prayer, Albrecht Dietrich, _Eine Mithrasliturgie_, Leipsic, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following prayer is the opening invocation of what appears to\r\n    be a Mithraic liturgy, and may date from a period earlier than the\r\n    fourth century. It gives, as is natural, no elaborated statement\r\n    of Mithraic doctrine, but, as in all prayer, much is implied in\r\n    the forms used and the spirit of the religion breathed through it.\r\n    The combination has already begun as is shown by the doctrine of\r\n    the four elements. It should be added that Professor Cumont does\r\n    not regard it as a Mithraic liturgy at all, but accounts for the\r\n    distinct mention of the name Mithras, which is to be found in some\r\n    parts, to a common tendency of semi-magical incantations to employ\r\n    as many deities as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Origin of my origin, first Beginning of my beginning, Spirit of\r\nSpirit, first of the spirit in me. Fire which to compose me has been given\r\nof God, first of the fire in me. Water of water, first of the water in me.\r\nEarthy Substance of earthy substance, first of the earthy substance, the\r\nentire body of me, N. N. son of N. N., completely formed by an honorable\r\narm and an immortal right hand in the lightless and illuminated world, in\r\nthe inanimated and the animated. If it seem good to you to restore me to\r\nan immortal generation, who am held by my underlying nature, that after\r\nthis present need which presses sorely upon me I may behold the immortal\r\nBeginning with the immortal Spirit, the immortal Water, the Solid and the\r\nAir, that I may be born again, by the thought, that I may be consecrated\r\nand the holy Spirit may breathe in me, that I may gaze with astonishment\r\nat the holy Fire, that I may look upon abysmal and frightful Water of the\r\nsun-rising, and the generative Ether poured around may listen to me. For I\r\nwill to-day look with immortal eyes, I who was begotten a mortal from a\r\nmortal womb, exalted by a mighty working power and incorruptible right\r\nhand, I may look with an immortal spirit upon the immortal Eon and the\r\nLord of the fiery crowns, purified by holy consecrations, since a little\r\nunder me stands the human power of mind, which I shall regain after the\r\npresent bitter, oppressive, and debt-laden need, I, N. N. the son of N.\r\nN., according to God’s unchangeable decree, for it is not within my power,\r\nborn mortal, to mount up with the golden light flashes of the immortal\r\nilluminator. Stand still, corruptible human nature, and leave me free\r\nafter the pitiless and crushing necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 36. The Religious Policy of the Emperors from Heliogabalus to Philip the\r\nArabian, 217-249\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the brief exception of the reign of Maximinus Thrax (235-238),\r\nChristians enjoyed peace from the death of Caracalla to the death of\r\nPhilip the Arabian. This was not due to disregard of the laws against\r\nChristians nor to indifference to suspected dangers to the Empire arising\r\nfrom the new religion, but to the policy of religious syncretism which had\r\ncome in with the family of Severus. The wife of Septimius Severus was the\r\ndaughter of Julius Bassianus, priest of the Sun-god of Emesa, and of the\r\nrulers of the dynasty of Severus one, Heliogabalus, was himself a priest\r\nof the same syncretistic cult, and another, Alexander, was under the\r\ninfluence of the women of the same priestly family.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Lampridius, _Vita Heliogabali_, 3, 6, 7. Preuschen, _Analecta_, I, §\r\n12.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lampridius is one of the _Scriptores Historiæ Augustæ_, by whom is\r\n    a series of lives of the Roman emperors. The series dates from the\r\n    fourth century, and is of importance as containing much\r\n    information which is not otherwise accessible. The dates of the\r\n    various lives are difficult to determine. Avitus Bassianus, known\r\n    as Heliogabalus, a name he assumed, reigned 218-222.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 3. But when he had once entered the city, he enrolled Heliogabalus\r\namong the gods and built a temple to him on the Palatine Hill next the\r\nimperial palace, desiring to transfer to that temple the image of Cybele,\r\nthe fire of Vesta, the Palladium, the sacred shields, and all things\r\nvenerated by the Romans; and he did this so that no other god than\r\nHeliogabalus should be worshipped at Rome. He said, besides, that the\r\nreligions of the Jews and the Samaritans and the Christian worship should\r\nbe brought thither, that the priesthood of Heliogabalus should possess the\r\nsecrets of all religions.\r\n\r\nCh. 6. Not only did he wish to extinguish the Roman religions, but he was\r\neager for one thing throughout the entire world—that Heliogabalus should\r\neverywhere be worshipped as god.\r\n\r\nCh. 7. He asserted, in fact, that all the gods were servants of his god,\r\nsince some he called his chamber-servants, others slaves, and others\r\nservants in various capacities.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Lampridius, _Vita Alexandri Severi_, 29, 43, 49. Preuschen,\r\n_Analecta_, I, § 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Alexander Severus (222-235) succeeded his cousin Heliogabalus. The\r\n    mother of Alexander, Julia Mammæa, sister of Julia Soæmias, mother\r\n    of Heliogabalus, was a granddaughter of Julius Bassianus, whose\r\n    daughter, Julia Domna, had married Septimius Severus. It was\r\n    through marriages with the female descendants of Julius, who was\r\n    priest of the Sun-god at Emesa, that the members of the dynasty of\r\n    Severus were connected and their attitude toward religion\r\n    determined. It was in the reign of Alexander that syncretism\r\n    favorable to Christianity was at its height.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 29. This was his manner of life: as soon as there was opportunity—that\r\nis, if he had not spent the night with his wife—he performed his devotions\r\nin the early morning hours in his lararium, in which he had statues of the\r\ndivine princes and also a select number of the best men and the more holy\r\nspirits, among whom he had Apollonius of Tyana, and as a writer of his\r\ntimes says, Christ, Abraham, and Orpheus, and others similar, as well as\r\nstatues of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nCh. 43. He wished to erect a temple to Christ and to number Him among the\r\ngods. Hadrian, also, is said to have thought of doing this, and commanded\r\ntemples without any images to be erected in all cities, and therefore\r\nthese temples, because they have no image of the Divinity, are to-day\r\ncalled _Hadriani_, which he is said to have prepared for this end. But\r\nAlexander was prevented from doing this by those who, consulting the\r\nauspices, learned that if ever this were done all would be Christians, and\r\nthe other temples would have to be deserted.\r\n\r\nCh. 49. When the Christians took possession of a piece of land which\r\nbelonged to the public domain and in opposition to them the guild of cooks\r\nclaimed that it belonged to them, he decreed that it was better that in\r\nthat place God should be worshipped in some fashion rather than that it be\r\ngiven to the cooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VI, 21. (MSG, 20:574.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mother of the Emperor, whose name was Julia Mammæa, was a most pious\r\nwoman, if ever one was. When the fame of Origen had extended everywhere\r\nand had come even to her ears, she desired greatly to see the man, and to\r\nmake trial of his understanding of divine things, which was admired by\r\nall. When she was staying for a time in Antioch, she sent for him with a\r\nmilitary escort. Having remained with her for a while and shown her many\r\nthings which were for the glory of the Lord and of the excellency of\r\ndivine teaching, he hastened back to his accustomed labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Firmilianus, _Ep. ad Cyprianum_, in Cyprian, _Ep. 75_. (MSL,\r\n3:1211.) Preuschen, _Analecta_, I, § 14:2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following epistle is found among the Epistles of Cyprian, to\r\n    whom it is addressed. It is of importance in connection with the\r\n    persecution of Maximinus, throwing light on the occasion and\r\n    extent of the persecution and relating instances of strange\r\n    fanaticism and exorcism.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I wish to tell you about an affair connected with this very matter\r\n[baptism by heretics, the main subject of the epistle, _v. infra_, § 52]\r\nwhich occurred among us. About twenty years ago, in the time after Emperor\r\nAlexander, there happened in these parts many struggles and difficulties,\r\neither in common to all men or privately to Christians. There were,\r\nfurthermore, many and frequent earthquakes, so that many cities throughout\r\nCappadocia and Pontus were thrown down; and some even were dragged down\r\ninto the abyss and swallowed by the gaping earth. From this, also, there\r\narose a severe persecution against the Christian name. This arose suddenly\r\nafter the long peace of the previous age. Because of the unexpected and\r\nunaccustomed evil, it was rendered more terrible for the disturbance of\r\nour people.\r\n\r\nSerenianus was at that time governor of our province, a bitter and cruel\r\npersecutor. But when the faithful had been thus disturbed and were fleeing\r\nhither and thither from fear of persecution and were leaving their native\r\ncountry and crossing over to other regions—for there was opportunity of\r\ncrossing over, because this persecution was not over the whole world, but\r\nwas local—there suddenly arose among us a certain woman who in a state of\r\necstasy announced herself as a prophetess and acted as if filled with the\r\nHoly Ghost. And she was so moved by the power of the chief demons that for\r\na long time she disturbed the brethren and deceived them; for she\r\naccomplished certain wonderful and portentous things: thus, she promised\r\nthat she would cause the earth to be shaken, not that the power of the\r\ndemon was so great that he could shake the earth and disturb the elements,\r\nbut that sometimes a wicked spirit, foreseeing and understanding that\r\nthere will be an earthquake, pretends that he will do what he foresees\r\nwill take place. By these lies and boastings he had so subdued the minds\r\nof several that they obeyed him and followed whithersoever he commanded\r\nand led. He would also make that woman walk in the bitter cold of winter\r\nwith bare feet over the frozen snow, and not to be troubled or hurt in any\r\nrespect by walking in this fashion. Moreover, she said she was hurrying to\r\nJudea and Jerusalem, pretending that she had come thence. Here, also, she\r\ndeceived Rusticus, one of the presbyters, and another one who was a\r\ndeacon, so that they had intercourse with the same woman. This was shortly\r\nafter detected. For there suddenly appeared before her one of the\r\nexorcists, a man approved and always well versed in matters of religious\r\ndiscipline; he, moved by the exhortation of many of the brethren, also,\r\nwho were themselves strong in the faith, and praiseworthy, raised himself\r\nup against that wicked spirit to overcome it; for the spirit a little\r\nwhile before, by its subtle deceitfulness, had predicted, furthermore,\r\nthat a certain adverse and unbelieving tempter would come. Yet that\r\nexorcist, inspired by God’s grace, bravely resisted and showed that he who\r\nbefore was regarded as holy was a most wicked spirit. But that woman, who\r\npreviously, by the wiles and deceits of the demon, was attempting many\r\nthings for the deception of the faithful, had among other things by which\r\nshe deceived many also frequently dared this—to pretend that with an\r\ninvocation, not to be contemned, she sanctified bread and consecrated the\r\neucharist and offered sacrifice to the Lord without the sacrament as\r\ncustomarily uttered; and to have baptized many, making use of the usual\r\nand lawful words of interrogation, that nothing might seem to be different\r\nfrom the ecclesiastical and lawful mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VI, 34. (MSG, 20:595.) Preuschen, _Analecta_,\r\nI, § 15, and Kirch, n. 397.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following tradition that Philip the Arabian was a Christian is\r\n    commonly regarded as doubtful. That he favored the Christians, and\r\n    even protected them, may be the basis for such a report.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Gordianus (238-244) had been Roman Emperor for six years, Philip\r\n(244-249) succeeded him. It is reported that he, being a Christian,\r\ndesired on the day of the last paschal vigil to share with the multitude\r\nin the prayers of the Church, but was not permitted by him who then\r\npresided to enter until he had made confession and numbered himself among\r\nthose who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of\r\npenitence. For if he had not done this, he would never have been received\r\nby him, on account of the many crimes he had committed, and it is said\r\nthat he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious\r\nfear of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 37. The Extension of the Church at the Middle of the Third Century\r\n\r\n\r\nSome approximately correct idea of the extension of the Church by the\r\nmiddle of the third century may be gathered from a precise statement of\r\nthe organization of the largest church, that at Rome, about the year 250\r\n(_a_), from the size of provincial synods, of which we have detailed\r\nstatements for North Africa (_b_), from references to organized and\r\napparently numerous churches in various places not mentioned in earlier\r\ndocuments (_c_). That the Church, at least in Egypt and parts adjacent,\r\nhad ceased to be confined chiefly to the cities and that it was composed\r\nof persons of all social ranks is attested by Origen (_d_).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Cornelius, _Ep. ad Fabium_, in Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VI, 43. (MSG,\r\n20:622.) _Cf._ Kirch, n. 222 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cornelius was bishop of Rome 251-253.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis avenger of the Gospel [Novatus] did not then know that there should\r\nbe one bishop in a Catholic church; yet he was not ignorant (for how could\r\nhe be) that in it [_i.e._, the Roman church] there were forty-six\r\npresbyters, seven deacons, seven subdeacons, forty-two acolytes, fifty-two\r\nexorcists, readers, and janitors, and over fifteen hundred widows and\r\npersons in distress, all of whom the grace and kindness of the Master\r\nnourished. But not even this great multitude, so necessary in the Church,\r\nnor those who through God’s providence were rich and full, together with\r\nvery many, even innumerable, people, could turn him from such desperation\r\nand recall him to the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Cyprian, _Epistulæ 71_ [=70] (MSL, 4:424) and 59:10 [=54] (MSL,\r\n3:877)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The church in North Africa had grown very rapidly before Cyprian\r\n    was elevated to the see of Carthage. An evidence of this is the\r\n    number of councils held in North Africa. That held under\r\n    Agrippinus, between 218 and 222, was the first known in that part\r\n    of the Church. Under Cyprian a council was held at Carthage in 258\r\n    at which no less than seventy bishops, whose names and opinions\r\n    have been preserved, are given. See ANF, V, 565 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ep. 71_ [=70]. _Ad Quintum._\r\n\r\nWhich thing, indeed, Agrippinus [A. D. 218-222], also a man of worthy\r\nmemory, with his fellow-bishops, who at that time governed the Lord’s\r\nChurch in the province of Africa and Numidia, decreed, and by the\r\nwell-weighed examination of the common council established.\r\n\r\n_Ep. 59_ [=54]:10. _Ad Cornelium._\r\n\r\nI have also intimated to you, my brother, by Felicianus, that there had\r\ncome to Carthage Privatus, an old heretic in the colony of Lambesa, many\r\nyears ago condemned for many and grave crimes by the judgment of ninety\r\nbishops, and severely remarked upon in the letters of Fabian and Donatus,\r\nalso our predecessors, as is not hidden from your knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Cyprian, _Epistula 67_ [=68]. (MSL, 3:1057, 1065.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following extracts from Cyprian’s Epistle “To the Clergy and\r\n    People abiding in Spain, concerning Basilides and Martial,” is of\r\n    importance as bearing upon the development of the appellate\r\n    jurisdiction of the Roman see, for which see the epistle in its\r\n    entirety as given in Cyprian’s works, ANF, vol. V, for the\r\n    treatment of the vexed question of discipline in the case of those\r\n    receiving certificates that they had sacrificed, (see below, §§ 45\r\n    _f._), and as the first definite statements as to localities in\r\n    Spain where there were Christians and bishops placed over the\r\n    Church. The mass of martyrdoms that have been preserved refer to\r\n    still others.\r\n\r\n\r\nCyprian … to Felix, the presbyter, and to the peoples abiding in Legio\r\n[Leon] and Asturica [Astorga], also to Lælius, the deacon, and the people\r\nabiding in Emerita [Merida], brethren in the Lord, greeting. When we had\r\ncome together, dearly beloved brethren, we read your letters, which,\r\naccording to the integrity of your faith and your fear of God, you wrote\r\nto us by Felix and Sabinus, our fellow-bishops, signifying that Basilides\r\nand Martial, who had been stained with the certificates of idolatry and\r\nbound with the consciousness of wicked crimes, ought not to exercise the\r\nepiscopal office and administer the priesthood of God. Wherefore, since we\r\nhave written, dearly beloved brethren, and as Felix and Sabinus, our\r\ncolleagues, affirm, and as another Felix, of Cæsar-Augusta [Saragossa], a\r\nmaintainer of the faith and a defender of the truth, signifies in his\r\nletter, Basilides and Martial have been contaminated by the abominable\r\ncertificate of idolatry.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Origen, _Contra Celsum_, III, 9. (MSG, 11:951.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    With the following should be compared the statements of Pliny,\r\n    more than a hundred years earlier, relative to Bithynia. See\r\n    above, § 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nCelsus says that “if all men wished to become Christians, the latter would\r\nnot desire it.” That this is false, is evident from this, that Christians\r\ndo not neglect, as far as they are able, to take care to spread their\r\ndoctrines throughout the whole world. Some, accordingly, have made it\r\ntheir business to go round about not only through cities, but even\r\nvillages and country houses, that they may persuade others to become pious\r\nworshippers of God.… At present, indeed, when because of the multitude of\r\nthose who have embraced the teaching, not only rich men, but also some\r\npersons of rank and delicate and high-born ladies, receive the teachers of\r\nthe Word, there will be some who dare to say that it is for the sake of a\r\nlittle glory that certain assume the office of Christian teachers. In the\r\nbeginning, when there was much danger, especially to its teachers, this\r\nsuspicion could have had no place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. The Internal Development Of The Church In Doctrine, Custom,\r\nAnd Constitution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe characteristic Eastern and Western conceptions of Christianity began\r\nto be clearly differentiated in the early years of the third century. A\r\njuristic conception of the Church as a body at the head of which, and\r\nclothed with authority, appeared the bishop of Rome, had, indeed, become\r\ncurrent at Rome in the last decade of the second century on the occasion\r\nof the Easter controversy, which had ended in an estrangement between the\r\npreviously closely affiliated churches of Asia Minor and the West,\r\nespecially Rome (§ 38). Western theology soon became centred in North\r\nAfrica under the legally trained Tertullian, by whom its leading\r\nprinciples were laid down in harmony with the bent of the Latin genius (§\r\n39). In this period numerous attempts were made to solve the problem\r\narising from the unity of God and the divinity of Christ, without recourse\r\nto a Logos christology. Some of the more unsuccessful of these attempts\r\nhave since been grouped under the heads of Dynamistic and of Modalistic\r\nMonarchianism (§ 40). At the same time Montanism was excluded from the\r\nChurch (§ 41), as subversive of the distinction between the clergy and\r\nlaity and the established organs of the Church’s government, which in the\r\nrecent rise of a theory of the necessity of the episcopate (see above, §\r\n27) had become important. In the administration of the penitential\r\ndiscipline (§ 42) the position of the clergy and the realization of a\r\nhierarchically organized Church was still further advanced, preparatory\r\nfor the position of Cyprian. At the same time as these constitutional\r\ndevelopments were taking place in the West, and especially in North\r\nAfrica, there occurred in Egypt and Palestine a remarkable advance in\r\ndoctrinal discussion, whereby the theology of the apologists was developed\r\nin the Catechetical School of Alexandria, especially under the leadership\r\nof Clement of Alexandria and Origen (§ 43). In this new speculation a vast\r\nmass of most fruitful theological ideas was built up, from which\r\nsubsequent ages drew for the defence of the traditional faith, but some of\r\nwhich served as the basis of new and startling heresies. Corresponding to\r\nthe intellectual development within the Church was the last phase of\r\nHellenic philosophy, known as Neo-Platonism (§ 44), which subsequently\r\ncame into bitter conflict with the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 38. The Easter Controversy and the Separation of the Churches of Asia\r\nMinor from the Western Churches\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church grew up with only a loose form of organization. Each local\r\ncongregation was for a while autonomous, and it was the local constitution\r\nthat first took a definite and fixed form. In the first centuries local\r\ncustoms naturally varied, and conflicts were sure to arise when various\r\nhitherto isolated churches came into closer contact and the sense of\r\nsolidarity deepened. The first clash of opposing customs occurred over the\r\ndate of Easter, as to which marked differences existed between the\r\nchurches of Asia Minor, at that time the most flourishing part of the\r\nChurch, and the churches of the West, especially with the church of Rome,\r\nthe strongest local church of all. The course of the controversy is\r\nsufficiently stated in the following selection from Eusebius. The outcome\r\nwas the practical isolation of the churches of Asia Minor for many years.\r\nThe controversy was not settled, and the churches of Asia Minor did not\r\nagain play a prominent part in the Church until the time of Constantine\r\nand the Council of Nicæa, 325 (see § 62, _b_), although a provisional\r\nadjustment of the difficulty, so far as the West was concerned, took place\r\nshortly before, at the Council of Arles (see § 62, _a_, 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nEusebius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 23, 24. (MSG, 20:489.) Mirbt, n. 22, and in\r\nKirch, n. 78 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    A brief extract from the following may be found above in § 3 in a\r\n    somewhat different connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 23. At this time a question of no small importance arose. For the\r\nparishes [_i.e._, dioceses in the later sense of that word] of all Asia,\r\nas from an older tradition, held that the fourteenth day of the moon,\r\nbeing the day on which the Jews were commanded to sacrifice the lamb,\r\nshould be observed as the feast of the Saviour’s passover, and that it was\r\nnecessary, therefore, to end their fast on that day, on whatever day of\r\nthe week it might happen to fall. It was not, however, the custom of the\r\nchurches elsewhere to end it at this time, but they observed the practice,\r\nwhich from apostolic tradition has prevailed to the present time, of\r\nending the fast on no other day than that of the resurrection of the\r\nSaviour. Synods and assemblies of bishops were held on this account, and\r\nall with one consent, by means of letters addressed to all, drew up an\r\necclesiastical decree that the mystery of the resurrection of the Lord\r\nfrom the dead should be celebrated on no other day than on the Lord’s Day,\r\nand that we should observe the close of the paschal fast on that day only.\r\nThere is still extant a writing of those who were then assembled in\r\nPalestine, over whom Theophilus, bishop of the parish of Cæsarea, and\r\nNarcissus, Bishop of Jerusalem, presided; also another of those who were\r\nlikewise assembled at Rome, on account of the same question, which bears\r\nthe name of Victor; also of the bishops in Pontus, over whom Palmas, as\r\nthe oldest, presided; and of the parishes in Gaul, of which Irenæus was\r\nbishop; and of those in Osrhoene and the cities there; and a personal\r\nletter of Bacchylus, bishop of the church in Corinth, and of a great many\r\nothers who uttered one and the same opinion and judgment and cast the same\r\nvote. Of these, there was one determination of the question which has been\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nCh. 24. But the bishops of Asia, led by Polycrates, decided to hold fast\r\nto the customs handed down to them. He himself, in a letter addressed to\r\nVictor and the church of Rome, set forth the tradition which had come down\r\nto him as follows: “We observe the exact day, neither adding nor taking\r\nanything away. For in Asia, also, great lights have fallen asleep, which\r\nshall rise again on the day of the Lord’s coming, when He shall come with\r\nglory from heaven and shall seek out all the saints. Of these were Philip,\r\none of the twelve Apostles, who fell asleep at Hierapolis, and his two\r\naged virgin daughters and his other daughter, who, having lived in the\r\nHoly Spirit, rest at Ephesus; and, moreover, John, who reclined on the\r\nLord’s bosom, and being a priest wore the sacerdotal mitre, who was both a\r\nwitness and a teacher; he fell asleep at Ephesus; and, further, Polycarp\r\nin Smyrna, both a bishop and a martyr.… All these observed the fourteenth\r\nday of the passover, according to the Gospel, deviating in no respect, but\r\nfollowing the rule of faith. And I, Polycrates, do the same, the least of\r\nyou all, according to the tradition of my relatives, some of whom I have\r\nclosely followed. For seven of my relatives were bishops, and I am the\r\neighth. And my relatives always observed the day when the people put away\r\nthe leaven; I, therefore, am not affrighted by terrifying words. For those\r\ngreater than I have said, We ought to obey God rather than men.”…\r\nThereupon(57) Victor, who was over the church of Rome, immediately\r\nattempted to cut off from the common unity the parishes of all Asia, with\r\nthe churches that agreed with them, as being heterodox. And he published\r\nletters declaring that all the brethren there were wholly excommunicated.\r\nBut this did not please all the bishops, and they besought him to consider\r\nthe things of peace, of neighborly unity and love. Words of theirs are\r\nstill extant, rather sharply rebuking Victor. Among these were Irenæus,\r\nwho sent letters in the name of the brethren in Gaul, over whom he\r\npresided, and maintained that the mystery of the resurrection of the Lord\r\nshould be observed only on the Lord’s Day, yet he fittingly admonishes\r\nVictor that he should not cut off whole churches of God which observed the\r\ntradition of an ancient custom, and after many other words he proceeds as\r\nfollows: “For the controversy is not merely concerning the day, but also\r\nconcerning the very manner of the fast. For some think that they should\r\nfast one day, others two, yet others more; some, moreover, count their\r\ndays as consisting of forty hours day and night. And this variety of\r\nobservance has not originated in our times, but long before, in the days\r\nof our ancestors. It is likely that they did not hold to strict accuracy,\r\nand thus was formed a custom for their posterity, according to their own\r\nsimplicity and their peculiar method. Yet all these lived more or less in\r\npeace, and we also live in peace with one another; and the disagreement in\r\nregard to the fast confirms the agreement in the faith.… Among these were\r\nthe elders [_i.e._, bishops of earlier date] before Soter, who presided\r\nover the church which thou [Victor] now rulest. We mean Anicetus, and\r\nPius, and Hyginus, and Telesphorus, and Sixtus. They neither observed it\r\nthemselves nor did they permit others after them to do so. And yet, though\r\nthey did not observe it, they were none the less at peace with those who\r\ncame to them from the parishes in which it was observed, although this\r\nobservance was more opposed to those who did not observe it. But none were\r\never cast out on account of this form, but the elders before thee, who did\r\nnot observe it, sent the eucharist to those of the other parishes\r\nobserving it. And when the blessed Polycarp was at Rome in the time of\r\nAnicetus, and they disagreed a little about certain other things, they\r\nimmediately made peace with one another, not caring to quarrel over this\r\npoint. For neither could Anicetus persuade Polycarp not to observe what he\r\nhad always observed with John, the disciple of the Lord, and the other\r\nApostles with whom he had associated; neither could Polycarp persuade\r\nAnicetus to observe it, as he said that he ought to follow the customs of\r\nthe elders who had preceded him. But though matters were thus, they\r\nnevertheless communed together and Anicetus granted the eucharist in the\r\nchurch to Polycarp, manifestly as a mark of respect.(58) And they parted\r\nfrom each other in peace, maintaining the peace of the whole Church, both\r\nof those who observed and those who did not.” Thus Irenæus, who was truly\r\nwell named, became a peace-maker in this matter, exhorting and negotiating\r\nin this way for the peace of the churches. And he conferred by letter\r\nabout this disputed question, not only with Victor, but also with most of\r\nthe other rulers of the churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 39. The Religion of the West: Its Moral and Juristic Character\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the writings of Tertullian a conception of Christianity is quite fully\r\ndeveloped according to which the Gospel was a new law of life, with its\r\nprescribed holy seasons and hours for prayer; its sacrifices, though as\r\nyet only sacrifices of prayer; its fasts and almsgiving, which had\r\npropitiatory effect, atoning for sins committed and winning merit with\r\nGod; its sacred rites, solemnly administered by an established hierarchy;\r\nand all observed for the sake of a reward which God in justice owed those\r\nwho kept His commandments. It is noticeable that already there is the same\r\ndivided opinion as to marriage, whereby, on the one hand, it was regarded\r\nas a concession to weakness, a necessary evil, and, on the other, a high\r\nand holy relation, strictly monogamous, and of abiding worth. The\r\npropitiatory and meritorious character of fasts and almsgiving as laid\r\ndown by Tertullian was developed even further by Cyprian and became a\r\npermanent element in the penitential system of the Church, ultimately\r\naffecting its conception of redemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Tertullian, _De Oratione_, 23, 25, 28. (MSL, 1:1298.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 23. As to kneeling, also, prayer is subject to diversity of observance\r\non account of a few who abstain from kneeling on the Sabbath. Since this\r\ndissension is particularly on its trial before the churches, the Lord will\r\ngive His grace that the dissentients may either yield or else follow their\r\nown opinion without offence to the others. We, however, as we have\r\nreceived, only on the Sunday of the resurrection ought to guard not only\r\nagainst this kneeling, but every posture and office of anxiety; deferring\r\neven our businesses, lest we give any place to the devil. Similarly, too,\r\nthe period of Pentecost, is a time which we distinguish by the same\r\nsolemnity of exultation. But who would hesitate every day to prostrate\r\nhimself before God, at least in the first prayer with which we enter on\r\nthe daylight? At fasts, moreover, and stations, no prayer should be made\r\nwithout kneeling and the remaining customary marks of humility. For then\r\nwe are not only praying, but making supplication, and making satisfaction\r\nto our Lord God.\r\n\r\nCh. 25. Touching the time, however, the extrinsic observance of certain\r\nhours will not be unprofitable; those common hours, I mean, which mark the\r\nintervals of the day—the third, the sixth, the ninth—which we may find in\r\nScripture to have been more solemn than the rest.\r\n\r\nCh. 28. This is the spiritual victim which has abolished the pristine\r\nsacrifices.… We are the true adorers and true priests, who, praying in the\r\nspirit, in the spirit sacrifice prayer, proper and acceptable to God,\r\nwhich, assuredly, He has required, which He has looked forward to for\r\nHimself. This victim, devoted from the whole heart, fed on faith, tended\r\nby truth, entire in innocence, pure in chastity, garlanded with love\r\n[agape], we ought to escort with the pomp of good works, amid psalms and\r\nhymns, unto God’s altar, to obtain all things from God for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Tertullian, _De Jejun._, 3. (MSL, 2:100.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following is a characteristic statement of the meritorious and\r\n    propitiatory character of fasting. See below, _h_, Cyprian.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince He himself both commands fasting and calls a soul wholly\r\nshattered—properly, of course, by straits of diet—a sacrifice (Psalm\r\n51:18), who will any longer doubt that of all macerations as to food the\r\nrationale has been this: that by a renewed interdiction of food and\r\nobservance of the precept the primordial sin might now be expiated, so\r\nthat man may make God satisfaction through the same causative material by\r\nwhich he offended, that is, by interdiction of food; and so, by way of\r\nemulation, hunger might rekindle, just as satiety had extinguished,\r\nsalvation, contemning for the sake of one thing unlawful many things that\r\nare lawful?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Tertullian, _De Baptismo_, 17. (MSL, 1:1326.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt remains to put you in mind, also, of the due observance of giving and\r\nreceiving baptism. The chief priest (_summus sacerdos_), who is the\r\nbishop, has the right of giving it; in the second place, the presbyters\r\nand deacons, yet not without the bishop’s authority, on account of the\r\nhonor of the Church. When this has been preserved, peace is preserved.\r\nBesides these, even laymen have the right; for what is equally received\r\ncan be equally given. If there are no bishops, priests, or deacons, other\r\ndisciples are called. The word of the Lord ought not to be hidden away by\r\nany. In like manner, also, baptism, which is equally God’s property, can\r\nbe administered by all; but how much more is the rule of reverence and\r\nmodesty incumbent on laymen, since these things belong to their superiors,\r\nlest they assume to themselves the specific functions of the episcopate!\r\nEmulation of the episcopal office is the mother of schism.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Tertullian, _De Pœnitentia_, 2. (MSL, 1:1340.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow small is the gain if you do good to a grateful man, or the loss if to\r\nan ungrateful man! A good deed has God as its debtor, just as an evil deed\r\nhas Him also; for the judge is a rewarder of every cause. Now, since God\r\nas judge presides over the exacting and maintaining of justice, which is\r\nmost dear to Him, and since it is for the sake of justice that He appoints\r\nthe whole sum of His discipline, ought one to doubt that, as in all our\r\nacts universally, so, also, in the case of repentance, justice must be\r\nrendered to God?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Tertullian, _Scorpiace_, 6. (MSL, 2:157.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf he had put forth faith to suffer martyrdoms, not for the contest’s\r\nsake, but for its own benefit, ought it not to have had some store of\r\nhope, for which it might restrain its own desire and suspend its wish,\r\nthat it might strive to mount up, seeing that they, also, who strive to\r\ndischarge earthly functions are eager for promotion? Or how will there be\r\nmany mansions in the Father’s house, if not for a diversity of deserts?\r\nHow, also, will one star differ from another star in glory, unless in\r\nvirtue of a disparity of their rays?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Tertullian, _Ad Uxorem_, I, 3; II, 8-10. (MSL, 1:1390, 1415.) _Cf._\r\nKirch, n. 181.\r\n\r\n\r\nI, 3. There is no place at all where we read that marriages are\r\nprohibited; of course as a “good thing.” What, however, is better than\r\nthis “good,” we learn from the Apostle in that he permits marriage,\r\nindeed, but prefers abstinence; the former on account of the insidiousness\r\nof temptations, the latter on account of the straits of the times (I Cor.\r\n7:26). Now by examining the reason for each statement it is easily seen\r\nthat the permission to marry is conceded us as a necessity; but whatever\r\nnecessity grants, she herself deprecates. In fact, inasmuch as it is\r\nwritten, “It is better to marry than to burn” (I Cor. 7:9), what sort of\r\n“good” is this which is only commended by comparison with “evil,” so that\r\nthe reason why “marrying” is better is merely that “burning” is worse?\r\nNay; but how much better is it neither to marry nor to burn?\r\n\r\nII, 8. Whence are we to find adequate words to tell fully of the happiness\r\nof that marriage which the Church cements and the oblation(59) confirms,\r\nand the benediction seals; which the angels announce, and the Father holds\r\nfor ratified? For even on earth children do not rightly and lawfully wed\r\nwithout their father’s consent. What kind of yoke is that of two believers\r\nof one hope, one discipline, and the same service? The two are brethren,\r\nthe two are fellow-servants; no difference of spirit or flesh; nay, truly,\r\ntwo in one flesh; where there is one flesh the spirit is one.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Tertullian, _De Monogamia_, 9, 10. (MSL, 2:991 _f._)\r\n\r\n\r\n    This work was written after Tertullian became a Montanist, and\r\n    with other Montanists repudiated second marriage, to which\r\n    reference is made in both passages. But the teaching of the Church\r\n    regarding remarriage after divorce was as Tertullian here speaks.\r\n    The reference to offering at the end of ch. 10 does not refer to\r\n    the eucharist, but to prayers. See above, _Ad Uxorem_, ch. II, 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 9. So far is it true that divorce “was not from the beginning” [_cf._\r\nMatt. 19:8] that among the Romans it is not till after the six hundredth\r\nyear after the foundation of the city that this kind of hardness of heart\r\nis recorded to have been committed. But they not only repudiate, but\r\ncommit promiscuous adultery; to us, even if we do divorce, it will not be\r\nlawful to marry.\r\n\r\nCh. 10. I ask the woman herself, “Tell me, sister, have you sent your\r\nhusband before in peace?” What will she answer? In discord? In that case\r\nshe is bound the more to him with whom she has a cause to plead at the bar\r\nof God. She is bound to another, she who has not departed from him. But if\r\nshe say, “In peace,” then she must necessarily persevere in that peace\r\nwith him whom she will be no longer able to divorce; not that she would\r\nmarry, even if she had been able to divorce him. Indeed, she prays for his\r\nsoul, and requests refreshment for him meanwhile, and fellowship in the\r\nfirst resurrection; and she offers on the anniversary of his falling\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Cyprian, _De Opere et Eleemosynis_, 1, 2, 5. (MSL, 4:625.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage (249-258), was the most important\r\n    theologian and ecclesiastic between Tertullian and Augustine. He\r\n    developed the theology of the former especially in its\r\n    ecclesiastical lines, and his idea of the Church was accepted by\r\n    the latter as a matter beyond dispute. His most important\r\n    contributions to the development of the Church were his\r\n    hierarchical conceptions, which became generally accepted as the\r\n    basis of the episcopal organization of the Church (see below, §§\r\n    46, 50, 51). His writings, which are of great importance in the\r\n    history of the Church, consist only of epistles and brief tracts.\r\n    His influence did much to determine the lines of development of\r\n    the Western Church, and especially the church of North Africa.\r\n    With the following _cf. supra_, § 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 1. Many and great, beloved brethren, are the divine benefits wherewith\r\nthe large and abundant mercy of God the Father and of Christ both has\r\nlabored and is always laboring for our salvation: because the Father sent\r\nthe Son to preserve us and give us life, that He might restore us; and the\r\nSon was willing to be sent and to become the son of man, that He might\r\nmake us the sons of God. He humbled Himself that He might raise up the\r\npeople who before were prostrate; He was wounded that He might heal our\r\nwounds; He served that He might draw to liberty those who were in bondage;\r\nHe underwent death, that He might set forth immortality to mortals. These\r\nare many and great boons of compassion. But, moreover, what a providence,\r\nand how great the clemency, that by a plan of salvation it is provided for\r\nus that more abundant care should be taken for preserving man who has been\r\nredeemed! For when the Lord, coming to us, had cured those wounds which\r\nAdam had borne, and had healed the old poisons of the serpent, He gave a\r\nlaw to the sound man, and bade him sin no more lest a worse thing should\r\nbefall the sinner. We had been limited and shut up in a narrow space by\r\nthe commandment of innocence. Nor should the infirmity and weakness of\r\nhuman frailty have anything it might do, unless the divine mercy, coming\r\nagain in aid, should open some way of securing salvation by pointing out\r\nworks of justice and mercy, so that by almsgiving we may wash away\r\nwhatever foulness we subsequently contract.\r\n\r\nCh. 2. The Holy Spirit speaks in the sacred Scriptures saying, “By\r\nalmsgiving and faith sins are purged” [Prov. 16:6]. Not, of course, those\r\nsins which had been previously contracted, for these are purged by the\r\nblood and sanctification of Christ. Moreover, He says again, “As water\r\nextinguishes fire, so almsgiving quencheth sin” [Eccles. 3:30]. Here,\r\nalso, is shown and proved that as by the laver of the saving water the\r\nfire of Gehenna is extinguished, so, also, by almsgiving and works of\r\nrighteousness the flame of sin is subdued. And because in baptism\r\nremission of sins is granted once and for all, constant and ceaseless\r\nlabor, following the likeness of baptism, once again bestows the mercy of\r\nGod.… The Lord also teaches this in the Gospel.… The Merciful One teaches\r\nand warns that works of mercy be performed; because He seeks to save those\r\nwho at great cost He has redeemed, it is proper that those who after the\r\ngrace of baptism have become foul can once more be cleansed.\r\n\r\nCh. 5. The remedies for propitiating God are given in the words of God\r\nhimself. The divine instructions have taught sinners what they ought to\r\ndo; that by works of righteousness God is satisfied, and with the merits\r\nof mercy sins are cleansed.… He [the angel Raphael, _cf._ Tobit. 12:8, 9]\r\nshows that our prayers and fastings are of little avail unless they are\r\naided by almsgiving; that entreaties alone are of little force to obtain\r\nwhat they seek, unless they be made sufficient by the addition of deeds\r\nand good works. The angel reveals and manifests and certifies that our\r\npetitions become efficacious by almsgiving, that life is redeemed from\r\ndangers by almsgiving, that souls are delivered from death by almsgiving.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 40. The Monarchian Controversies\r\n\r\n\r\nMonarchianism is a general term used to include all the unsuccessful\r\nattempts of teachers within the Church to explain the divine element in\r\nChrist without doing violence to the doctrine of the unity of God, and yet\r\nwithout employing the Logos christology. These attempts were made chiefly\r\nbetween the latter part of the second century and the end of the third.\r\nThey fall into classes accordingly as they regard the divine element in\r\nChrist as personal or impersonal. One class makes the divine element to be\r\nan impersonal power (Greek, dynamis) sent from God into the man Jesus;\r\nhence the term “Dynamistic Monarchians.” The other class makes the divine\r\nelement a person, without, however, making any personal distinction\r\nbetween Father and Son, only a difference in the mode in which the one\r\ndivine person manifests Himself; hence the term “Modalistic Monarchians.”\r\nBy some the Dynamistic Monarchians have been called Adoptionists, because\r\nthey generally taught that the man Jesus ultimately became the Son of God,\r\nnot being such by nature but by “adoption.” The name Adoptionist has been\r\nso long applied to a heresy of the eighth century, chiefly in Spain, that\r\nit leads to confusion to use the term in connection with Monarchianism.\r\nFurthermore, to speak of them as Dynamistic Monarchians groups them with\r\nother Monarchians, which is desirable. The most important school of\r\nModalistic Monarchians was that of Sabellius, in which the Modalistic\r\nprinciple was developed so as to include the three persons of the Trinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sources may be found collected and annotated in Hilgenfeld,\r\n    _Ketsergeschichte_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) Dynamistic Monarchianism\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Hippolytus, _Refut._, VII, 35, 36. (MSG, 16:3342.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 35. A certain Theodotus, a native of Byzantium, introduced a novel\r\nheresy, saying some things concerning the origin of the universe partly in\r\nkeeping with the doctrines of the true Church, in so far as he admits that\r\nall things were created by God. Forcibly appropriating, however, his idea\r\nof Christ from the Gnostics and from Cerinthus and Ebion, he alleges that\r\nHe appeared somewhat as follows: that Jesus was a man, born of a virgin,\r\naccording to the counsel of the Father, and that after He had lived in a\r\nway common to all men, and had become pre-eminently religious, He\r\nafterward at His baptism in Jordan received Christ, who came from above\r\nand descended upon Him. Therefore miraculous powers did not operate within\r\nHim prior to the manifestation of that Spirit which descended and\r\nproclaimed Him as the Christ. But some [_i.e._, among the followers of\r\nTheodotus] are disposed to think that this man never was God, even at the\r\ndescent of the Spirit; whereas others maintain that He was made God after\r\nthe resurrection from the dead.\r\n\r\nCh. 36. While, however, different questions have arisen among them, a\r\ncertain one named Theodotus, by trade a money-changer [to be distinguished\r\nfrom the other Theodotus, who is commonly spoken of as Theodotus, the\r\nleather-worker], attempted to establish the doctrine that a certain\r\nMelchizedek is the greatest power, and that this one is greater than\r\nChrist. And they allege that Christ happens to be according to the\r\nlikeness of this one. And they themselves, similarly with those who have\r\nbeen previously spoken of as adherents of Theodotus, assert that Jesus is\r\na mere man, and that in conformity with the same account, Christ descended\r\nupon Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Little Labyrinth_, in Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 28. (MSG,\r\n20:511.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The author of _The Little Labyrinth_, a work from which Eusebius\r\n    quotes at considerable length, is uncertain. It has been\r\n    attributed to Hippolytus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Artemonites say that all early teachers and the Apostles themselves\r\nreceived and taught what they now declare, and that the truth of the\r\npreaching [_i.e._, the Gospel] was preserved until the time of Victor, who\r\nwas the thirteenth bishop in Rome after Peter, and that since his\r\nsuccessor, Zephyrinus, the truth has been corrupted. What they say might\r\nbe credible if first of all the divine Scriptures did not contradict them.\r\nAnd there are writings of certain brethren which are older than the times\r\nof Victor, and which they wrote in behalf of the truth against the heathen\r\nand against heresies of their time. I refer to Justin, Miltiades, Tatian,\r\nClement, and others. In all of their works Christ is spoken of as God. For\r\nwho does not know the works of Irenæus and of Melito and of others, which\r\nteach that Christ is God and man? And how many psalms and hymns, written\r\nby the faithful brethren from the beginning, celebrate Christ as the Word\r\nof God, speaking of Him as divine? How, then, since the Church’s present\r\nopinion has been preached for so many years, can its preaching have been\r\ndelayed, as they affirm, until the times of Victor? And how is it that\r\nthey are not ashamed to speak thus falsely of Victor, knowing well that he\r\ncut off from communion Theodotus, the leather-worker, the leader and\r\nfather of this God-denying apostasy, and the first to declare that Christ\r\nis mere man.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain confessor, Natalius, not long ago, but in our day.\r\nThis man was deceived at one time by Asclepiodotus and another Theodotus,\r\na certain money-changer. Both of them were disciples of Theodotus, the\r\nleather-worker, who, as I said, was the first person excommunicated by\r\nVictor, bishop at that time, on account of this senseless sentiment or,\r\nrather, senselessness. Natalius was persuaded by them to allow himself to\r\nbe chosen bishop of this heresy with a salary, so that he was to receive\r\nfrom them one hundred and fifty _denarii_ a month.\r\n\r\nThey have treated the divine Scriptures recklessly and without fear; they\r\nhave set aside the rule of ancient faith; and Christ they have not known,\r\nnot endeavoring to learn what the divine Scriptures declare, but striving\r\nlaboriously after any form of syllogism which may be found to suit their\r\nimpiety. And if any one brings before them a passage of divine Scripture,\r\nthey see whether a conjunctive or a disjunctive form of syllogism can be\r\nmade from it. And as being of the earth and speaking of the earth and as\r\nignorant of Him that cometh from above, they devote themselves to geometry\r\nand forsake the holy writings of God. Euclid is at least laboriously\r\nmeasured by some of them; Aristotle and Theophrastus admired; and Galen,\r\nperhaps, by some is even worshipped. But that those who use the arts of\r\nunbelievers for their heretical opinion and adulterate the simple faith of\r\nthe divine Scriptures by the craft of the godless are not near the faith,\r\nwhat need is there to say? Therefore, they have laid their hands boldly\r\nupon the divine Scriptures, alleging that they have corrected them. That I\r\nam not speaking falsely of them in this matter, whoever wishes can learn.\r\nFor if any one will collect their respective copies and compare them with\r\none another, he will find that they differ greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B) Modalistic Monarchianism\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Hippolytus, _Adversus Noetum,\r\n    Refutatio_, IX, 7 _ff._, X, 27; Tertullian, _Adversus Praxean_;\r\n    Basil, _Ep._ 207, 210. (PNF, ser. II, vol. VIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Hippolytus, _Refut._, X, 27. (MSG, 16:3440.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following passages from the great work of Hippolytus give the\r\n    earlier form of Modalistic Monarchianism. They are also of\r\n    importance as being a part of the foundation for the statement of\r\n    Harnack and others, that this heresy was the official Roman\r\n    doctrine for some years. See also IX, 12, of which the text may be\r\n    found in Kirch, nn. 201-206. The whole question as to the position\r\n    of Callistus, or Calixtus, as bishop of Rome and his relations to\r\n    the Church as a whole is difficult and full of obscurity, due to a\r\n    large extent to the fact that the principal source for his history\r\n    is the work of Hippolytus, who, as may easily be seen, was\r\n    bitterly opposed to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoetus, a Smyrnæan by birth, a reckless babbler and trickster, introduced\r\nthis heresy, which originated with Epigonus, and was adopted by Cleomenes,\r\nand has thus continued to this day among his successors. Noetus asserts\r\nthat there is one Father and God of the universe, and that He who had made\r\nall things was, when He wished, invisible to those who existed, and when\r\nHe wished He became visible; that He is invisible when He is not seen and\r\nvisible when He is seen; that the Father is unbegotten when He is not\r\ngenerated, but begotten when He is born of a virgin; that He is not\r\nsubject to suffering and is immortal when He does not suffer and die, but\r\nwhen His passion came upon Him Noetus admits that the Father suffers and\r\ndies. The Noetians think that the Father is called the Son according to\r\nevents at different times.\r\n\r\nCallistus supported the heresy of these Noetians, but we have carefully\r\ndescribed his life [see above, § 19, _c_]. And Callistus himself likewise\r\nproduced a heresy, taking his starting-point from these Noetians. And he\r\nacknowledges that there is one Father and God, and that He is the Creator\r\nof the universe, and that He is called and regarded as Son by name, yet\r\nthat in substance He is one.(60) For the Spirit as Deity is not, he says,\r\nany being different from the Logos, or the Logos from Deity; therefore,\r\nthis one person is divided by name, but not according to substance. He\r\nsupposes this one Logos to be God and he says that He became flesh. He is\r\ndisposed to maintain that He who was seen in the flesh and crucified is\r\nSon, but it is the Father who dwells in Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Hippolytus, _Refut._, IX, 7, 11 _f._ (MSG, 16:3369.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 7. There has appeared a certain one, Noetus by name, by birth a\r\nSmyrnæan. This person introduced from the tenets of Heraclitus a heresy.\r\nNow a certain Epigonus became his minister and pupil, and this person\r\nduring his sojourn in Rome spread his godless opinion.… But Zephyrinus\r\nhimself was in course of time enticed away and hurried headlong into the\r\nsame opinion; and he had Callistus as his adviser and fellow-champion of\r\nthese wicked tenets.… The school of these heretics continued in a\r\nsuccession of teachers to acquire strength and to grow because Zephyrinus\r\nand Callistus helped them to prevail.\r\n\r\nCh. 11. Now that Noetus affirms that the Son and the Father are the same,\r\nno one is ignorant. But he makes a statement as follows: “When, indeed, at\r\nthe time the Father was not yet born, He was justly styled the Father; and\r\nwhen it pleased Him to undergo generation and to be begotten, He himself\r\nbecame His own Son, not another’s.” For in this manner he thinks he\r\nestablishes the Monarchy, alleging that the Father and the Son, so called,\r\nare not from one another, but are one and the same, Himself from Himself,\r\nand that He is styled by the names Father and Son, according to the\r\nchanges of times.\r\n\r\nCh. 12. Now Callistus brought forward Zephyrinus himself and induced him\r\nto avow publicly the following opinions: “I know that there is one God,\r\nJesus Christ; and that excepting Him I do not know another begotten and\r\ncapable of suffering.” When he said, “The Father did not die but the Son,”\r\nhe would in this way continue to keep up ceaseless disturbance among the\r\npeople. And we [_i.e._, Hippolytus], becoming aware of his opinions, did\r\nnot give place to him, but reproved him and withstood him for the truth’s\r\nsake. He rushed into folly because all consented to his hypocrisy; we,\r\nhowever, did not do so, and he called us worshippers of two gods,\r\ndisgorging freely the venom lurking within him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Hippolytus, _Adversus Noetum_. (MSG, 10:804.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following is from a fragment which seems to be the conclusion\r\n    of an extended work against various heresies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome others are secretly introducing another doctrine who have become the\r\ndisciples of a certain Noetus, who was a native of Smyrna, and lived not\r\nvery long ago. This man was greatly puffed up with pride, being inspired\r\nby the conceit of a strange spirit. He alleged that Christ was the Father\r\nhimself, and that the Father himself was born and suffered and died.… When\r\nthe blessed presbyters heard these things they summoned him before the\r\nChurch and examined him. But he denied at first that he held such\r\nopinions. Afterward, taking shelter among some and gathering round him\r\nsome others who had been deceived in the same way, he wished to maintain\r\nhis doctrine openly. And the blessed presbyters summoned him and examined\r\nhim. But he resisted, saying, “What evil, then, do I commit when I glorify\r\nChrist?” And the presbyters replied to him, “We, too, know in truth one\r\nGod; we know Christ; we know that the Son suffered even as He suffered,\r\nand died even as He died, and rose again on the third day, and is at the\r\nright hand of the Father, and cometh to judge the living and the dead. And\r\nthese things which we have learned we assert.” Then, after refuting him,\r\nthey expelled him from the Church. And he was carried to such a pitch of\r\npride that he established a school.\r\n\r\nNow they seek to exhibit the foundation of their dogma, alleging that it\r\nis said in the Law, “I am the God of your fathers; ye shall have no other\r\ngods beside me” [_i.e._, of Moses, _cf._ Ex. 3:6, 13; 20:3]; and again in\r\nanother passage, “I am the first and the last and besides me there is none\r\nother” [_cf._ Is. 44:6]. Thus they assert that God is one. And then they\r\nanswer in this manner: “If therefore I acknowledge Christ to be God, He is\r\nthe Father himself, if He is indeed God; and Christ suffered, being\r\nHimself God, and consequently the Father suffered, for He was the Father\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Tertullian, _Adv. Praxean_, 1, 2, 27, 29. (MSL, 2:177 _f._, 214.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tertullian is especially bitter against Praxeas, because he\r\n    prevented the recognition of the Montanists at Rome when it seemed\r\n    likely that they would be treated favorably. The work _Adversus\r\n    Praxean_ is the most important work of Western theology on the\r\n    Trinity before the time of Augustine. It was corrected in some\r\n    important points by Novatian, but its clear formulæ remained in\r\n    Western theology permanently. The work belongs to the late\r\n    Montanistic period of Tertullian.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 1. In various ways has the devil rivalled the truth. Sometimes his aim\r\nhas been to destroy it by defending it. He maintains that there is one\r\nonly Lord, the Almighty Creator of the world, that of this doctrine of the\r\nunity he may fabricate a heresy. He says that the Father himself came down\r\ninto the Virgin, was Himself born of her, Himself suffered, indeed, was\r\nHimself Jesus Christ.… He [Praxeas] was the first to import into Rome this\r\nsort of perversity, a man of restless disposition in other respects, and\r\nabove all inflated with the pride of martyrdom [confessorship] simply and\r\nsolely because of a short annoyance in prison; when, even if he had given\r\nhis body to be burned, it would have profited him nothing, not having the\r\nlove of God, whose very gifts he resisted and destroyed. For after the\r\nBishop of Rome had acknowledged the prophetic gifts of Montanus,\r\nPriscilla, and Maximilla, and in consequence of the acknowledgment had\r\nbestowed his peace on the churches of Asia and Phrygia, Praxeas, by\r\nimportunately urging false accusations against the prophets themselves and\r\ntheir churches, and insisting on the authority of the bishop’s\r\npredecessors in the see, compelled him to recall the letter of peace which\r\nhe had issued, as well as to desist from his purpose of acknowledging the\r\nsaid gifts. Thus Praxeas did two pieces of the devil’s work in Rome: he\r\ndrove out prophecy and he brought in heresy; he put to flight the\r\nParaclete and he crucified the Father.\r\n\r\nCh. 2. After a time, then, the Father was born, and the Father\r\nsuffered—God himself, the Almighty, is preached as Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nCh. 27. For, confuted on all sides by the distinction between the Father\r\nand the Son, which we make while their inseparable union remains as [by\r\nthe examples] of the sun and the ray, and the fountain and the river—yet\r\nby help of their conceit of an indivisible number [with issues] of two and\r\nthree, they endeavor to interpret this distinction in a way which shall\r\nnevertheless agree with their own opinions; so that, all in one person,\r\nthey distinguish two—Father and Son—understanding the Son to be the flesh,\r\nthat is the man, that is Jesus; and the Father to be the Spirit, that is\r\nGod, that is Christ.\r\n\r\nCh. 29. Since we(61) teach in precisely the same terms that the Father\r\ndied as you say the Son died, we are not guilty of blasphemy against the\r\nLord God, for we do not say that He died after the divine nature, but only\r\nafter the human.… They [the heretics], indeed, fearing to incur blasphemy\r\nagainst the Father, hope to diminish it in this way, admitting that the\r\nFather and the Son are two; but if the Son, indeed, suffers, the Father is\r\nHis fellow-sufferer.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Formula Macrostichos_, in Socrates. _Hist. Ec._, II, 19. (MSG,\r\n67:229.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the Arian controversy several councils were held at Antioch in\r\n    the endeavor to bring about a reconciliation of the parties. At\r\n    the third council of Antioch, A. D. 345, the elaborate _Formula\r\n    Macrostichos_ was put forth, in which the council attempted to\r\n    steer a middle course between the Sabellians, who identified the\r\n    Father and the Son, and the extreme Arians, who made the Son a\r\n    creature. Text may also be found in Hahn, _op. cit._, § 159.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who say that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the same person,\r\nimpiously understanding the three names to refer to one and the same\r\nperson, we expel with good reason from the Church, because by the\r\nincarnation they subject the Father, who is infinite and incapable of\r\nsuffering, to finitude and suffering in the incarnation. Such are those\r\ncalled Patripassianists by the Romans and Sabellians by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Athanasius, _Orationes contra Arianos_, IV, 9, 25. (MSG, 26:480,\r\n505.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    For Athanasius, _v. infra_, § 65, _c_. Of the four _Orations\r\n    against the Arians_, attributed to Athanasius and placed between\r\n    the years 356 and 362, doubts have been raised against the\r\n    genuineness of the fourth. The following quotations are, in any\r\n    case, valuable as setting forth the Sabellian position. But the\r\n    case against the fourth oration has not been conclusively proved.\r\n    In the passage from ch. 25 the statement is that of the\r\n    Sabellians, not of Athanasius.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 9. If, again, the One have two names, this is the expedient of\r\nSabellius, who said that Son and Father were the same and did away with\r\nboth, the Father when there is a Son, and the Son when there is a Father.…\r\n\r\nCh. 25. “As there are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit, so also\r\nthe Father is the same, but is dilated into Son and Spirit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Athanasius, _Expositio fidei_. (MSG, 25:204.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the critical questions regarding this little work of uncertain\r\n    date see PNF, ser. II, vol. VI, p. 83.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor neither do we hold a Son-father, as do the Sabellians, calling Him of\r\none but not of the same essence, and thus destroying the existence of the\r\nSon.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Basil the Great, _Epistula_, 210:3. (MSG, 32:772, 776.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Basil the Great, Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, was one of the\r\n    more important ecclesiastics of the fourth century, and the leader\r\n    of the New-Nicene party in the Arian controversy. _V. infra_, §\r\n    66, _c_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSabellianism is Judaism imported into the preaching of the Gospel under\r\nthe guise of Christianity. For if a man calls Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\r\none, but manifold as to person [prosopon], and makes one hypostasis of the\r\nthree, what else does he do than deny the everlasting pre-existence of the\r\nOnly begotten?…\r\n\r\nNow Sabellius did not even deprecate the formation of the persons without\r\nthe hypostasis, saying, as he did, that the same God, being one in\r\nsubstance,(62) was metamorphosed as the need of the moment required and\r\nspoken of now as Father, now as the Son, and now as Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 41. Later Montanism and the Consequences of its Exclusion from the\r\nChurch\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the West Montanism rapidly discarded the extravagant chiliasm of\r\nMontanus and his immediate followers; it laid nearly all the stress upon\r\nthe continued work of the Holy Spirit in the Church and the need of a\r\nstricter moral discipline among Christians. This rigoristic discipline or\r\nmorality was not acceptable to the bulk of Christians, and along with the\r\nMontanists was driven out of the Church, except in the case of the clergy,\r\nto whom a stricter morality was regarded as applicable. In this way a\r\ndistinctive morality and mode of life came to be assigned to the clergy,\r\nand the separation between clergy and laity, or _ordo_ and _plebs_, which\r\nwas becoming established about the time of Tertullian, at least in the\r\nWest, was permanently fixed. (See § 42, _d_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTertullian, _De Exhortatione Castitatis_, 7. (MSL, 2:971.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    As a Montanist, Tertullian rejected second marriage, and in this\r\n    treatise, addressed to a friend who had recently lost his wife, he\r\n    treated it as the foulest adultery. This work belongs to the later\r\n    years of Tertullian’s life and incidentally reveals that a sharp\r\n    distinction between clergy and laity was becoming fixed in the\r\n    main body of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should be foolish if we thought that what is unlawful for priests(63)\r\nis lawful for laics. Are not even we laics priests? It is written: “He has\r\nmade us kings also, and priests to God and his Father.” The authority of\r\nthe Church has made the difference between order [_ordinem_] and the laity\r\n[_plebem_], and the honor has been sanctified by the bestowal of the\r\norder. Therefore, where there has been no bestowal of ecclesiastical\r\norder, you both offer and baptize and are a priest to yourself alone. But\r\nwhere there are three, there is the Church, though they are laics.…\r\nTherefore, if, when there is necessity, you have the right of a priest in\r\nyourself, you ought also to have the discipline of a priest where there is\r\nnecessity that you have the right of a priest. As a digamist,(64) do you\r\nbaptize? As a digamist, do you offer? How much more capital a crime it is\r\nfor a digamist laic to act as a priest, when the priest, if he turn\r\ndigamist, is deprived of the power of acting as a priest?… God wills that\r\nat all times we be so conditioned as to be fitted at all times and in all\r\nplaces to undertake His sacraments. There is one God, one faith, one\r\ndiscipline as well. So truly is this the case that unless the laics well\r\nobserve the rules which are to guide the choice of presbyters, how will\r\nthere be presbyters at all who are chosen from among the laics?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 42. The Penitential Discipline\r\n\r\n\r\nIn baptism the convert received remission of all former sins, and, what\r\nwas equivalent, admission to the Church. If he sinned gravely after\r\nbaptism, could he again obtain remission? In the first age of the Church\r\nthe practice as to this question inclined toward rigorism, and the man who\r\nsinned after baptism was in many places permanently excluded from the\r\nChurch (_cf._ Heb. 10:26, 27), or the community of those whose sins had\r\nbeen forgiven and were certain of heaven. By the middle of the second\r\ncentury the practice at Rome tended toward permitting one readmission\r\nafter suitable penance (_a_). After this the penitential discipline\r\ndeveloped rapidly and became an important part of the business of the\r\nlocal congregation (_b_). The sinner, by a long course of\r\nself-mortification and prayer, obtained the desired readmission (_c_). The\r\nMontanists, however, in accord with their general rigorism, would make it\r\nextremely hard, if not impossible, to obtain readmission or forgiveness.\r\nThe body of the Church, and certainly the Roman church under the lead of\r\nits bishop, who relied upon Matt. 16:18, adopted a more liberal policy and\r\ngranted forgiveness on relatively easy terms to even the worst offenders\r\n(_d_). The discipline grew less severe, because martyrs or confessors,\r\naccording to Matt. 10:20, were regarded as having the Spirit, and\r\ntherefore competent to speak for God and announce the divine forgiveness.\r\nThese were accustomed to give “letters of peace,” which were commonly\r\nregarded as sufficient to procure the immediate readmission of the\r\noffender (_e_), a practice which led to great abuse. One of the effects of\r\nthe development of the penitential discipline was the establishment of a\r\ndistinction between mortal and venial sins (_f_), the former of which\r\nwere, in general, acts involving unchastity, shedding of blood, and\r\napostasy, according to the current interpretation of Acts 15:29.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Hermas, _Pastor_, Man. IV, 3:1.\r\n\r\n\r\n    For Hermas and the _Pastor_, _v. supra_, § 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nI heard some teachers maintain, sir, that there is no other repentance\r\nthan that which takes place when we descend into the waters and receive\r\nremission of our former sins. He said to me, That was sound doctrine which\r\nyou heard; for that is really the case. For he who has received remission\r\nof his sins ought not to sin any more, but to live in purity.… The Lord,\r\ntherefore, being merciful, has had mercy on the work of His hands, and has\r\nset repentance for them; and He has intrusted to me the power over this\r\nrepentance. And therefore I say unto you that if any one is tempted by the\r\ndevil, and sins after that great and holy calling in which the Lord has\r\ncalled His people to everlasting life, he has opportunity to repent but\r\nonce. But if he should sin frequently after this, and then repent, to such\r\na man his repentance will be of no avail, for with difficulty will he\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Tertullian. _Apology_, 39. (MSL, 1:532.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe meet together as an assembly and congregation that, offering up prayer\r\nto God, with united force we may wrestle with Him in our prayers.… In the\r\nsame place, also, exhortations are made, rebukes and sacred censures are\r\nadministered. For with a great gravity is the work of judging carried on\r\namong us, as befits those who feel assured that they are in the sight of\r\nGod; and you have the most notable example of judgment to come when any\r\none has so sinned as to be severed from common union with us in prayer, in\r\nthe congregation, and in all sacred intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Tertullian, _De Pœnitentia_, 4, 9. (MSL, 2:1343, 1354.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    According to Bardenhewer, § 50:5, this work belongs to the\r\n    Catholic period of Tertullian’s literary activity. Text in part in\r\n    Kirch, nn. 175 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 4. As I live, saith the Lord, I prefer penance rather than death\r\n[_cf._ Ezek. 33:11]. Repentance, then, is life, since it is preferred to\r\ndeath. That repentance, O sinner like myself (nay, rather, less a sinner\r\nthan myself, for I acknowledge my pre-eminence in sins), do you hasten to\r\nembrace as a shipwrecked man embraces the protection of some plank. This\r\nwill draw you forth when sunk in the waves of sin, and it will bear you\r\nforward into the port of divine clemency.\r\n\r\nCh. 9. The narrower the sphere of action of this, the second and only\r\nremaining repentance, the more laborious is its probation; that it may not\r\nbe exhibited in the conscience alone, but may likewise be performed in\r\nsome act. This act, which is more usually expressed and commonly spoken of\r\nunder the Greek name, exomologesis, whereby we confess our sins to the\r\nLord, not indeed to Him as ignorant of them, but inasmuch as by confession\r\na satisfaction is made; of confession repentance is born; by repentance\r\nGod is appeased. And thus exomologesis is a discipline for man’s\r\nprostration and humiliation, enjoining a demeanor calculated to move\r\nmercy. With regard, also, to the very dress and food, it commands one to\r\nlie in sackcloth and ashes, to cover the body as in mourning, to lay the\r\nspirit low in sorrow, to exchange for severe treatment the sins which he\r\nhas committed; furthermore, to permit as food and drink only what is\r\nplain—not for the stomach’s sake, but for the soul’s; for the most part,\r\nhowever, to feed prayers on fastings, to groan, to weep, and make outcries\r\nunto the Lord our God; to fall prostrate before the presbyters and to\r\nkneel to God’s dear ones; to enjoin on all the brethren to be ambassadors\r\nto bear his deprecatory supplication before God. All this exomologesis\r\ndoes, that it may enhance repentance, that it may honor the Lord by fear\r\nof danger, may, by itself, in pronouncing against the sinner stand in\r\nplace of God’s indignation, and by temporal mortification (I will not say\r\nfrustrate, but rather) expunge eternal punishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Tertullian, _De Pudicitia_, 1, 21, 22. (MSL, 2:1032, 1078.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Callistus, to whom reference is made in the first chapter, was\r\n    bishop of Rome 217 to 222. The work, therefore, belongs to the\r\n    latest period of Tertullian’s life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 1. I hear that there has been an edict set forth, and, indeed, a\r\nperemptory one; namely, that the Pontifex Maximus, the bishop of bishops,\r\nissues an edict: “I remit to such as have performed penance, the sins both\r\nof adultery and fornication.”\r\n\r\nCh. 21. “But,” you say, “the Church has the power of forgiving sins.” This\r\nI acknowledge and adjudge more, I, who have the Paraclete himself in the\r\nperson of the new prophets, saying: “The Church has the power to forgive\r\nsins, but I will not do it, lest they commit still others.”… I now inquire\r\ninto your opinion, to discover from what source you usurp this power to\r\nthe Church.\r\n\r\nIf, because the Lord said to Peter, “Upon this rock I will build My Church\r\n[Matt. 16:18].… To Thee I have given the keys of the kingdom of heaven,”\r\nor “Whatsoever thou shalt bind or loose on earth, shall be bound or loosed\r\nin heaven,” you therefore presume that the power of binding and loosing\r\nhas descended to you, that is, to every church akin to Peter; what sort of\r\nman, then, are you, subverting and wholly changing the manifest intention\r\nof the Lord, who conferred the gift personally upon Peter? “On Thee,” He\r\nsays, “I will build my Church,” and “I will give thee the keys,” not to\r\nthe Church; and “whatsoever thou shalt have loosed or bound,” not what\r\nthey shall have loosed or bound. For so the result actually teaches. In\r\nhim (Peter) the Church was reared, that is, through him (Peter) himself;\r\nhe himself tried the key; you see what key: “Men of Israel, let what I say\r\nsink into your ears; Jesus, the Nazarene, a man appointed of God for\r\nyou,”(65) and so forth. Peter himself, therefore, was the first to unbar,\r\nin Christ’s baptism, the entrance to the kingdom of heaven, in which are\r\nloosed the sins that aforetime were bound.…\r\n\r\nWhat, now, has this to do with the Church and your Church, indeed, O\r\nPsychic? For in accordance with the person of Peter, it is to spiritual\r\nmen that this power will correspondingly belong, either to an Apostle or\r\nelse to a prophet.… And accordingly the “Church,” it is true, will forgive\r\nsins; but it will be the Church of the Spirit, by a spiritual man; not the\r\nChurch which consists of a number of bishops.\r\n\r\nCh. 22. But you go so far as to lavish this power upon martyrs indeed; so\r\nthat no sooner has any one, acting on a preconceived arrangement, put on\r\nsoft bonds in the nominal custody now in vogue, than adulterers beset him,\r\nfornicators gain access to him; instantly prayers resound about him;\r\ninstantly pools of tears of the polluted surround him; nor are there any\r\nwho are more diligent in purchasing entrance to the prison than they who\r\nhave lost the fellowship of the Church.… Whatever authority, whatever\r\nreason, restores ecclesiastical peace to the adulterer and the fornicator,\r\nthe same will be bound to come to the aid of the murderer and the idolater\r\nin their repentance.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Tertullian, _Ad Martyres_, 1. (MSL, 1:693.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following extract from Tertullian’s little work addressed to\r\n    martyrs in prison, written about 197, shows that in his earlier\r\n    life as a Catholic Christian he did not disapprove of the practice\r\n    of giving _libelli pacis_ by the confessors, a custom which in his\r\n    more rigoristic period under the influence of Montanism he\r\n    denounced most vehemently; see preceding extract from _De\r\n    Pudicitia_, ch. 22. The reference to some discord among the\r\n    martyrs is not elsewhere explained. For _libelli pacis_, see\r\n    Cyprian, _Ep. 10_ (=_Ep. 15_), 22 (=21).\r\n\r\n\r\nO blessed ones, grieve not the Holy Spirit, who has entered with you into\r\nthe prison; for if He had not gone with you there, you would not be there\r\nto-day. Therefore endeavor to cause Him to remain with you there; so that\r\nHe may lead you thence to the Lord. The prison, truly, is the devil’s\r\nhouse as well, wherein he keeps his family.… Let him not be successful in\r\nhis own kingdom by setting you at variance with one another, but let him\r\nfind you armed and fortified with concord; for your peace is war with him.\r\nSome, not able to find peace in the Church, have been accustomed to seek\r\nit from the imprisoned martyrs. Therefore you ought to have it dwelling\r\nwith you, and to cherish it and guard it, that you may be able, perchance,\r\nto bestow it upon others.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Tertullian, _De Pudicitia_, 19. (MSL, 2:1073.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The distinction between mortal and venial sins became of great\r\n    importance in the administration of penance and remained as a\r\n    feature of ecclesiastical discipline from the time of Tertullian.\r\n    The origin of the distinction was still earlier. See above, an\r\n    extract from the same work.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe ourselves do not forget the distinction between sins, which was the\r\nstarting-point of our discussion. And this, too, for John has sanctioned\r\nit [_cf._ I John 5:16], because there are some sins of daily committal to\r\nwhich we are all liable; for who is free from the accident of being angry\r\nunjustly and after sunset; or even of using bodily violence; or easily\r\nspeaking evil; or rashly swearing; or forfeiting his plighted word; or\r\nlying from bashfulness or necessity? In business, in official duties, in\r\ntrade, in food, in sight, in hearing, by how great temptations are we\r\nassailed! So that if there were no pardon for such simple sins as these,\r\nsalvation would be unattainable by any. Of these, then, there will be\r\npardon through the successful Intercessor with the Father, Christ. But\r\nthere are other sins wholly different from these, graver and more\r\ndestructive, such as are incapable of pardon—murder, idolatry, fraud,\r\napostasy, blasphemy, and, of course, adultery and fornication and whatever\r\nother violation of the temple of God there may be. For these Christ will\r\nno more be the successful Intercessor; these will not at all be committed\r\nby any one who has been born of God, for he will cease to be the son of\r\nGod if he commit them.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 43. The Catechetical School of Alexandria: Clement and Origen\r\n\r\n\r\nThree types of theology developed in the ante-Nicene Church: the Asia\r\nMinor school, best represented by Irenæus (_v._ § 33); the North African,\r\nrepresented by Tertullian and Cyprian (_v._ § 39); and the Alexandrian, in\r\nthe Catechetical School of which Clement and Origen were the most\r\ndistinguished members. In the Alexandrian theology the tradition of the\r\napologists (_v._ § 32) that Christianity was a revealed philosophy was\r\ncontinued, especially by Clement. Origen, following the bent of his\r\ngenius, developed other sides of Christian thought as well, bringing it\r\nall into a more systematic form than had ever before been attempted. The\r\nCatechetical School of Alexandria was the most celebrated of all the\r\neducational institutions of Christian antiquity. It aimed to give a\r\ngeneral secular and religious training. It appears to have been in\r\nexistence well before the end of the second century, having been founded,\r\nit is thought, by Pantænus. Clement assisted in the instruction from 190,\r\nand from about 200 was head of the school for a few years. In 202 or 203\r\nhe was forced by persecution under Septimius Severus to flee from the\r\ncity. He died before 215. Of his works, the most important is his\r\nthree-part treatise composed of his _Protrepticus_, an apologetic work\r\naddressed to the Greeks; his _Pædegogus_, a treatise on Christian\r\nmorality; and his _Stromata_, or miscellanies. Origen became head of the\r\nCatechetical School in 203, when but eighteen years old, and remained in\r\nthat position until 232, when, having been irregularly ordained priest\r\noutside his own diocese and being suspected of heresy, he was deposed. But\r\nhe removed to Cæsarea in Palestine, where he continued his work with the\r\ngreatest success and was held in the highest honor by the Church in\r\nPalestine and parts other than Egypt. He died 254 or 255 at Tyre, having\r\npreviously suffered severely in the Decian persecution. His works are of\r\nthe highest importance in various fields of theology. _De Principiis_ is\r\nthe first attempt to present in connected form the whole range of\r\nChristian theology. His commentaries cover nearly the entire Bible. His\r\n_Contra Celsum_ is the greatest of all early apologies. The _Hexapla_ was\r\nthe most elaborate piece of text-criticism of antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Eusebius. _Hist. Ec._, VI, deals at\r\n    length with Origen; Gregory Thaumaturgus, _Panegyric on Origen_,\r\n    in ANF. VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Clement of Alexandria, _Stromata_, I, 5. (MSG, 8:717.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clement’s view of the relation of Greek philosophy to Christian\r\n    revelation is almost identical with that of the apologists, as are\r\n    also many of his fundamental concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of the Lord philosophy was necessary to the Greeks for\r\nrighteousness. And now it becomes useful to piety, being a kind of\r\npreparatory training to those who attain to faith through demonstration.\r\n“For thy foot,” it is said, “will not stumble” if thou refer what is good,\r\nwhether belonging to the Greeks or to us, to Providence. For God is the\r\ncause of all good things; but of some primarily, as of the Old and the New\r\nTestament, and of others by consequence, as philosophy. Perchance, too,\r\nphilosophy was given to the Greeks directly till the Lord should call the\r\nGreeks also. For this was a schoolmaster to bring the Hellenic mind to\r\nChrist, as was the law to bring the Hebrews. Philosophy, therefore, was a\r\npreparation, paving the way for him who is perfected in Christ.\r\n\r\n“Now,” says Solomon, “defend wisdom, and it will exalt thee, and it will\r\nshield thee with a crown of pleasure.”(66) For when thou hast strengthened\r\nwisdom with a breastwork by philosophy, and with expenditure, thou wilt\r\npreserve her unassailable by sophists. The way of truth is therefore one.\r\nBut into it, as into a perennial river, streams flow from every side.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Clement of Alexandria, _Stromata_, VII, 10. (MSG, 9:47.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    See Clement of Alexandria, _VIIth Book of the Stromateis_, ed. by\r\n    Hort and Mayor, London, 1902. In making faith suffice for\r\n    salvation, Clement clearly distinguishes his position from that of\r\n    the Gnostics, though he uses the term “gnostic” as applicable to\r\n    Christians. See next passage.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowledge [gnosis], so to speak, is a perfecting of man as man, which is\r\nbrought about by acquaintance with divine things; in character, life, and\r\nword harmonious and consistent with itself and the divine Word. For by it\r\nfaith is made perfect, inasmuch as it is solely by it that the man of\r\nfaith becomes perfect. Faith is an internal good, and without searching\r\nfor God confesses His existence and glorifies Him as existent. Hence by\r\nstarting with this faith, and being developed by it, through the grace of\r\nGod, the knowledge respecting Him is to be acquired as far as possible.…\r\n\r\nBut it is not doubting, in reference to God, but believing, that is the\r\nfoundation of knowledge. But Christ is both the foundation and the\r\nsuperstructure, by whom are both the beginning and the end. And the\r\nextreme points, the beginning and the end, I mean faith and love, are not\r\ntaught. But knowledge, which is conveyed from communication through the\r\ngrace of God as a deposit, is intrusted to those who show themselves\r\nworthy of it; and from it the worth of love beams forth from light to\r\nlight. For it is said, “To him that hath shall be given” [_cf._ Matt.\r\n13:12]—to faith, knowledge; and to knowledge, love; and to love, the\r\ninheritance.…\r\n\r\nFaith then is, so to speak, a compendious knowledge of the essentials; but\r\nknowledge is the sure and firm demonstration of what is received by faith,\r\nbuilt upon faith by the Lord’s teaching, conveying us on to unshaken\r\nconviction and certainty. And, as it seems to me, the first saving change\r\nis that from heathenism to faith, as I said before; and the second, that\r\nfrom faith to knowledge. And this latter passing on to love, thereafter\r\ngives a mutual friendship between that which knows and that which is\r\nknown. And perhaps he who has already arrived at this stage has attained\r\nequality with the angels. At any rate, after he has reached the final\r\nascent in the flesh, he still continues to advance, as is fit, and presses\r\non through the holy Hebdomad into the Father’s house, to that which is\r\nindeed the Lord’s abode.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Clement of Alexandria, _Stromata_, V, 11. (MSG, 9:102, 106.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The piety of the Christian Gnostic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sacrifice acceptable with God is unchanging alienation from the body\r\nand its passions. This is the really true piety. And is not philosophy,\r\ntherefore, rightly called by Socrates the meditation on death? For he who\r\nneither employs his eyes in the exercise of thought nor draws from his\r\nother senses, but with pure mind applies himself to objects, practises the\r\ntrue philosophy.…\r\n\r\nIt is not without reason, therefore, that in the mysteries which are to be\r\nfound among the Greeks lustrations hold the first place; as also the laver\r\namong the barbarians. After these are the minor mysteries, which have some\r\nfoundation for instruction and preparation for what is to follow. In the\r\ngreat mysteries concerning the universe nothing remains to be learned, but\r\nonly to contemplate and comprehend with the mind nature and things. We\r\nshall understand the more of purification by confession, and of\r\ncontemplation by analysis, advancing by analysis to the first notion,\r\nbeginning with the properties underlying it; abstracting from the body its\r\nphysical properties, taking away the dimension of depth, then of breadth,\r\nand then of length. For the point which remains is a unit, so to speak,\r\nhaving position; from which, if we abstract position, there is the\r\nconception of unity.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we abstract all that belongs to bodies and things called\r\nincorporeal, we cast ourselves into the greatness of Christ, and thence\r\nadvancing into immensity by holiness, we may reach somehow to the\r\nconception of the Almighty, knowing not what He is, but knowing what He is\r\nnot. And form and motion, or standing, or a throne or place, or right hand\r\nor left, are not at all to be conceived as belonging to the Father of the\r\nuniverse, although it is so written. For what each of these signifies will\r\nbe shown in the proper place. The First Cause is not then in space, but\r\nabove time and space and name and conception.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Origen, _De Principiis_, I, 2:2. (MSG, 11:130.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Origen’s doctrine of the “eternal generation of the Son” was of\r\n    primary importance in all subsequent discussions on the Trinity.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet no one imagine that we mean anything unsubstantial when we call Him\r\nthe Wisdom of God; or suppose, for example, that we understand Him to be,\r\nnot a living being endowed with wisdom, but something which makes men\r\nwise, giving itself to, and implanting itself in, the minds of those who\r\nare made capable of receiving its virtues and intelligence. If, then, it\r\nis once rightly understood that the only begotten Son of God is His Wisdom\r\nhypostatically [substantialiter] existing, I know not whether our mind\r\nought to advance beyond this or entertain any suspicion that the\r\nhypostasis or substantia contains anything of a bodily nature, since\r\neverything corporeal is distinguished either by form, or color, or\r\nmagnitude. And who in his sound senses ever sought for form, or color, or\r\nsize, in wisdom, in respect of its being wisdom? And who that is capable\r\nof entertaining reverential thoughts or feelings regarding God can suppose\r\nor believe that God the Father ever existed, even for a moment of time,\r\nwithout having generated this Wisdom? For in that case he must say either\r\nthat God was unable to generate Wisdom before He produced her, so that He\r\nafterward called into being that which formerly did not exist, or that He\r\ncould, but—what is impious to say of God—was unwilling to generate; both\r\nof which suppositions, it is patent to all, are alike absurd and impious:\r\nfor they amount to this, either that God advanced from a condition of\r\ninability to one of ability, or that, although possessed of the power, He\r\nconcealed it, and delayed the generation of Wisdom. Therefore we have\r\nalways held that God is the Father of His only begotten Son, who was born\r\nindeed of Him, and derives from Him, what He is, but without any\r\nbeginning, not only such as may be measured by any divisions of time, but\r\neven that which the mind alone contemplates within itself, or beholds, so\r\nto speak, with the naked soul and understanding. And therefore we must\r\nbelieve that Wisdom was generated before any beginning that can be either\r\ncomprehended or expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Origen, _De Principiis_, I, 2:10. (MSG, 11:138.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Origen’s doctrine of “eternal creation” was based upon reasoning\r\n    similar to that employed to show the eternal generation of the\r\n    Son, but it was rejected by the Church, and figures among the\r\n    heresies known as Origenism. See below, §§ 87, 93.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs no one can be a father without having a son, nor a master without\r\npossessing a servant, so even God cannot be called omnipotent(67) unless\r\nthere exists those over whom He may exercise His power; and therefore,\r\nthat God may be shown to be almighty it is necessary that all things\r\nshould exist. For if any one assumes that some ages or portions of time,\r\nor whatever else he likes to call them, have passed away, while those\r\nthings which have been made did not yet exist, he would undoubtedly show\r\nthat during those ages or periods God was not omnipotent but became\r\nomnipotent afterward: viz., from the time that He began to have those over\r\nwhom He exercised power; and in this way He will appear to have received a\r\ncertain increase, and to have risen from a lower to a higher condition;\r\nsince there can be no doubt that it is better for Him to be omnipotent\r\nthan not to be so. And, now, how can it appear otherwise than absurd, that\r\nwhen God possessed none of those things which it was befitting for Him to\r\npossess, He should afterward, by a kind of progress, come to have them?\r\nBut if there never was a time when He was not omnipotent,(68) of necessity\r\nthose things by which He receives that title must also exist; and He must\r\nalways have had those over whom He exercised power, and which were\r\ngoverned by Him either as king or prince, of which we shall speak more\r\nfully when we come to discuss the subject of creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Origen, _De Principiis_, II, 9:6. (MSG, 11:230.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The theory of pre-existence and the pretemporal fall of each soul\r\n    was the basis of Origen’s theodicy. It caused great offence in\r\n    after years when theology became more stereotyped, and it has\r\n    retained no place in the Church’s thought, for the idea ran too\r\n    clearly counter to the biblical account of the Fall of Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have frequently shown by those statements which we are able to adduce\r\nfrom the divine Scriptures that God, the Creator of all things, is good,\r\nand just, and all-powerful. When in the beginning He created all those\r\nbeings whom He desired to create, _i.e._, rational natures, He had no\r\nother reason for creating them than on account of Himself, _i.e._, His\r\ngoodness. As He himself, then, was the cause of the existence of those\r\nthings which were to be created, in whom there was neither any variation\r\nnor change nor want of power, He created all whom He made equal and alike,\r\nbecause there was no reason for Him to produce variety and diversity. But\r\nsince those rational creatures themselves, as we have frequently shown and\r\nwill yet show in the proper place, were endowed with the power of free\r\nchoice, this freedom of his will incited each one either to progress by\r\nimitation of God or induced him to failure through negligence. And this,\r\nas we have already stated, is the cause of the diversity among rational\r\ncreatures, deriving its origin not from the will or judgment of the\r\nCreator, but from the freedom of the individual will. God, however, who\r\ndeemed it just to arrange His creatures according to merit, brought down\r\nthese differences of understanding into the harmony of one world, that He\r\nmight adorn, as it were, one dwelling, in which there ought to be not only\r\nvessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay and some, indeed, to\r\nhonor and others to dishonor, with those different vessels, or souls, or\r\nunderstandings. And these are the causes, in my opinion, why that world\r\npresents the aspect of diversity, while Divine Providence continues to\r\nregulate each individual according to the variety of his movements or of\r\nhis feelings and purpose. On which account the Creator will neither appear\r\nto be unjust in distributing (for the causes already mentioned) to every\r\none according to his merits; nor will the happiness or unhappiness of each\r\none’s birth, or whatever be the condition that falls to his lot, be deemed\r\naccidental; nor will different creators, or souls of different natures, be\r\nbelieved to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Origen, _Homil. in Exod._, VI, 9. (MSG, 12:338.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the following passage from Origen’s _Commentary on Exodus_ and\r\n    the four following passages are stated the essential points of\r\n    Origen’s theory of redemption. In this theory there are two\r\n    elements which have been famous in the history of Christian\r\n    thought: the relation of the death of Christ to the devil, and the\r\n    ultimate salvation of every soul. The theory that Christ’s death\r\n    was a ransom paid to the devil was developed by Gregory of Nyssa\r\n    and Gregory the Great, and reappeared constantly in theology down\r\n    to the scholastic period, when it was overthrown by Anselm and the\r\n    greater scholastics. Universal redemption or salvation, especially\r\n    when it included Satan himself, was never taken up by Church\r\n    theologians to any extent, and was one of the positions condemned\r\n    as Origenism. See § 93.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certain, they say, that one does not buy that which is his own. But\r\nthe Apostle says: “Ye are bought with a price.” But hear what the prophet\r\nsays: “You have been sold as slaves to your sins, and for your iniquities\r\nI have put away your mother.” Thou seest, therefore, that we are the\r\ncreatures of God, but each one has been sold to his sins, and has fallen\r\nfrom his Creator. Therefore we belong to God, inasmuch as we have been\r\ncreated by Him, but we have become the servants of the devil, inasmuch as\r\nwe have been sold to our sins. But Christ came to redeem us when we were\r\nservants to that master to whom we had sold ourselves by sinning.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Origen, _Contra Celsum_, VII, 17. (MSG, 11:1445.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we consider Jesus in relation to the divinity that was in Him, the\r\nthings which He did in this capacity are holy and do not offend our idea\r\nof God; and if we consider Him as a man, distinguished beyond all others\r\nby an intimate communion with the very Word, with Absolute Wisdom, He\r\nsuffered as one who was wise and perfect whatever it behooved Him to\r\nsuffer, who did all for the good of the human race, yea, even for the good\r\nof all intelligent beings. And there is nothing absurd in the fact that a\r\nman died, and that his death was not only an example of death endured for\r\nthe sake of piety, but also the first blow in the conflict which is to\r\noverthrow the power of the evil spirit of the devil, who had obtained\r\ndominion over the whole world. For there are signs of the destruction of\r\nhis empire; namely, those who through the coming of Christ are everywhere\r\nescaping from the power of demons, and who after their deliverance from\r\nthis bondage in which they were held consecrate themselves to God, and\r\naccording to their ability devote themselves day by day to advancement in\r\na life of piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i_) Origen, _Homil. in Matt._, XVI, 8. (MSG, 13:1398.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did this in service of our salvation so far that He gave His soul a\r\nransom for many who believed on Him. If all had believed on Him, He would\r\nhave given His soul as a ransom for all. To whom did He give His soul as a\r\nransom for many? Certainly not to God. Then was it not to the Evil One?\r\nFor that one reigned over us until the soul of Jesus was given as a ransom\r\nfor us. This he had especially demanded, deceived by the imagination that\r\nhe could rule over it, and he was not mindful of the fact that he could\r\nnot endure the torment connected with holding it fast. Therefore death,\r\nwhich appeared to reign over Him, did not reign over Him, since He was\r\n“free among the dead” and stronger than the power of death. He is, indeed,\r\nso far superior to it that all who from among those overcome by death will\r\nfollow Him can follow Him, as death is unable to do anything against\r\nthem.… We are therefore redeemed with the precious blood of Jesus. As a\r\nransom for us the soul of the Son of God has been given (not His spirit,\r\nfor this, according to Luke [_cf._ Luke 23:46] He had previously given to\r\nHis Father, saying: “Father, into Thy hands I commit my spirit”); also,\r\nnot His body, for concerning this we find nothing mentioned. And when He\r\nhad given His soul as a ransom for many, He did not remain in the power of\r\nhim to whom the ransom was given for many, because it says in the\r\nsixteenth psalm [Psalm 16:10]: “Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j_) Origen, _De Principiis_, I, 6:3. (MSG, 11:168.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following states in brief the theory of universal salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be borne in mind, however, that certain beings who fell away from\r\nthat one beginning of which we have spoken, have given themselves to such\r\nwickedness and malice as to be deemed altogether undeserving of that\r\ntraining and instruction by which the human race while in the flesh are\r\ntrained and instructed with the assistance of the heavenly powers: they\r\ncontinue, on the contrary, in a state of enmity and opposition to those\r\nwho are receiving this instruction and teaching. And hence it is that the\r\nwhole life of mortals is full of certain struggles and trials, caused by\r\nthe opposition and enmity against us of those who fell from a better\r\ncondition without at all looking back, and who are called the devil and\r\nhis angels, and other orders of evil, which the Apostle classed among the\r\nopposing powers. But whether any of these orders, who act under the\r\ngovernment of the devil and obey his wicked commands, will be able in a\r\nfuture world to be converted to righteousness because of their possessing\r\nthe faculty of freedom of will, or whether persistent and inveterate\r\nwickedness may be changed by habit into a kind of nature, you, reader, may\r\ndecide; yet so that neither in those things which are seen and temporal\r\nnor in those which are unseen and eternal one portion is to differ wholly\r\nfrom the final unity and fitness of things. But in the meantime, both in\r\nthose temporal worlds which are seen, and in those eternal worlds which\r\nare invisible, all those beings are arranged according to a regular plan,\r\nin the order and degree of merit; so that some of them in the first,\r\nothers in the second, some even in the last times, after having undergone\r\nheavier and severer punishments, endured for a lengthened period and for\r\nmany ages, so to speak, improved by this stern method of training, and\r\nrestored at first by the instruction of angels and subsequently advanced\r\nby powers of a higher grade, and thus advancing through each stage to a\r\nbetter condition, reach even to that which is invisible and eternal,\r\nhaving travelled by a kind of training through every single office of the\r\nheavenly powers. From which, I think, this will follow as an\r\ninference—that every rational nature can, in passing from one order to\r\nanother, go through each to all, and advance from all to each, while made\r\nthe subject of various degrees of proficiency and failure, according to\r\nits own actions and endeavors, put forth in the enjoyment of its power of\r\nfreedom of will.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k_) Origen, _De Principiis_, IV, 9-15. (MSG, 11:360, 363, 373.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Allegorism.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The method of exegesis known as allegorism, whereby the\r\n    speculations of the Christian theologians were provided with an\r\n    apparently scriptural basis, was taken over from the Jewish and\r\n    Greek philosophers and theologians who employed it in the study of\r\n    their sacred books. Origen, it should be added, contributed not a\r\n    little to a sound grammatical interpretation as well. For\r\n    Porphyry’s criticism of Origen’s methods of exegesis see Eusebius,\r\n    _Hist. Ec._, VI, 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 9. Now the cause, in all the points previously enumerated, of the\r\nfalse opinions and of the impious statements or ignorant assertions about\r\nGod appears to be nothing else than that the Scriptures are not understood\r\naccording to their spiritual meaning, but are interpreted according to the\r\nmere letter. And therefore to those who believe that the sacred books are\r\nnot the compositions of men, but were composed by the inspirations of the\r\nHoly Spirit, according to the will of the Father of all things through\r\nJesus Christ, and that they have come down to us, we must point out the\r\nmodes of interpretation which appear correct to us, who cling to the\r\nstandard of the heavenly Church according to the succession of the\r\nApostles of Jesus Christ. Now that there are certain mystical economies\r\nmade known in the Holy Scriptures, all, even the most simple of those who\r\nadhere to the word, have believed; but what these are, the candid and\r\nmodest confess they know not. If, then, one were to be perplexed about the\r\nincest of Lot with his daughters, and about the two wives of Abraham, and\r\nthe two sisters married to Jacob, and the two handmaids who bore him\r\nchildren, they can return no other answer than this—that these are\r\nmysteries not understood by us.…\r\n\r\nCh. 11. The way, then, as it seems to me, in which we ought to deal with\r\nthe Scriptures and extract from them their meaning is the following, which\r\nhas been ascertained from the sayings [of the Scriptures] themselves. By\r\nSolomon in the Proverbs we find some rule as this enjoined respecting the\r\nteaching of the divine writings, “And do thou portray them in a threefold\r\nmanner, in counsel and knowledge, to answer words of truth to them who\r\npropose them to thee” [_cf._ Prov. 22:20 _f._, LXX]. One ought, then, to\r\nportray the ideas of Holy Scripture in a threefold manner upon his soul,\r\nin order that the simple man may be edified by the “flesh,” as it were, of\r\nScripture, for so we name the obvious sense; while he who has ascended a\r\ncertain way may be edified by the “soul,” as it were. The perfect man, and\r\nhe who resembles those spoken of by the Apostle, when he says, “We speak\r\nwisdom among them that are perfect, but not the wisdom of the world, nor\r\nof the rulers of this world, who come to nought; but we speak the wisdom\r\nof God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom, which God hath ordained before the\r\nages unto our glory” [I Cor. 2:6, 7], may receive edification from the\r\nspiritual law, which was a shadow of things to come. For as man consists\r\nof body and soul and spirit, so in the same way does the Scripture\r\nconsist, which has been arranged by God for the salvation of men.\r\n\r\nCh. 12. But as there are certain passages which do not contain at all the\r\n“corporeal” sense, as we shall show in the following, there are also\r\nplaces where we must seek only for the “soul,” as it were, and “spirit” of\r\nScripture.\r\n\r\nCh. 15. But since, if the usefulness of the legislation and the sequence\r\nand beauty of the history were universally evident, we should not believe\r\nthat any other thing could be understood in the Scriptures save what was\r\nobvious, the Word of God has arranged that certain stumbling-blocks, and\r\noffences, and impossibilities, should be introduced into the midst of the\r\nlaw and the history, in order that we may not, through being drawn away in\r\nall directions by the merely attractive nature of the language, either\r\naltogether fall away from the true doctrines, as learning nothing worthy\r\nof God, or, by not departing from the letter, come to the knowledge of\r\nnothing more divine. And this, also, we must know: that, since the\r\nprincipal aim is to announce the “spiritual” connection in those things\r\nthat are done and that ought to be done where the Word found that things\r\ndone according to the history could be adapted to these mystic senses, He\r\nmade use of them, concealing from the multitude the deeper meaning; but\r\nwhere in the narrative of the development of super-sensual things there\r\ndid not follow the performance of those certain events which was already\r\nindicated by the mystical meaning the Scripture interwove in the history\r\nthe account of some event that did not take place, sometimes what could\r\nnot have happened; sometimes what could, but did not happen.… And at other\r\ntimes impossibilities are recorded for the sake of the more skilful and\r\ninquisitive, in order that they may give themselves to the toil of\r\ninvestigation of what is written, and thus attain to a becoming conviction\r\nof the manner in which a meaning worthy of God must be sought out in such\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 44. Neo-Platonism\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last phase of Hellenic philosophy was religious. It aimed to combine\r\nthe principles of many schools of the earlier period and to present a\r\nmetaphysical system that would at once give a theory of being and also\r\nfurnish a philosophical basis for the new religious life. This final\r\nphilosophy of the antique world was Neo-Platonism. It was thoroughly\r\neclectic in its treatment of earlier systems, but under Plotinus attained\r\nno small degree of consistency. The emphasis was laid especially upon the\r\nreligious problems, and in the system it may be fairly said that the\r\nreligious aspirations of heathenism found their highest and purest\r\nexpression. Because it was in close touch with current culture and in its\r\nmetaphysical principles was closely akin to the philosophy of the Church\r\nteachers, we find Neo-Platonism sometimes a bitter rival of Christianity,\r\nat other times a preparation for the Christian faith, as in the case of\r\nAugustine and Victorinus.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: _Select Works of Plotinus_, translated\r\n    by Thomas Taylor, ed. G. R. S. Mead, London, 1909 (contains\r\n    bibliography of other translations of Plotinus, including those in\r\n    French and German together with a select list of works bearing on\r\n    Neo-Platonism); _Select Works of Porphyry_, trans. by Thomas\r\n    Taylor, London, 1823; Taylor translated much from all the\r\n    Neo-Platonists, but his other books are very scarce.

Nauck, Leipsic, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The letter is addressed to Marcella by her husband, the\r\n    philosopher Porphyry. It gives a good idea of the religious and\r\n    ethical character of Neo-Platonism. For the metaphysical aspects\r\n    see Plotinus, translated by T. Taylor. Porphyry was, after\r\n    Plotinus, the greatest of the Neo-Platonists, and brought out most\r\n    clearly those religious elements which were rivals to\r\n    Christianity. His attack upon Christianity was keen and bitter,\r\n    and he was consequently especially hated by the Christians. He\r\n    died at Rome 304.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 16. You will honor God best when you form your soul to resemble him.\r\nThis likeness is only by virtue; for only virtue draws the soul upward\r\ntoward its own kind. There is nothing greater with God than virtue; but\r\nGod is greater than virtue. But God strengthens him who does what is good;\r\nbut of evil deeds a wicked demon is the instigator. Therefore the wicked\r\nsoul flees from God and wishes that the foreknowledge of God did not\r\nexist; and from the divine law which punishes all wickedness it shrinks\r\naway completely. But a wise man’s soul is in harmony with God, ever sees\r\nHim, ever is with Him. But if that which rules takes pleasure in that\r\nwhich is ruled, then God cares for the wise and provides for him; and\r\ntherefore is the wise man blessed, because he is under the protection of\r\nGod. It is not the discourses of the wise man which are honorable before\r\nGod, but his works; for the wise man, even when he keeps silence, honors\r\nGod, but the ignorant man, even in praying and sacrificing, dishonors the\r\nDivinity. So the wise man alone is a priest, alone is dear to God, alone\r\nknows how to pray.\r\n\r\nCh. 17. He who practises wisdom practises the knowledge of God; though not\r\nalways in prayer and sacrifice, practising piety toward God by his works.\r\nFor a man is not rendered agreeable to God by ruling himself according to\r\nthe prejudices of men and the vain declamations of the sophists. It is the\r\nman himself who, by his own works, renders himself agreeable to God, and\r\nis deified by the conforming of his own soul to the incorruptible blessed\r\nOne. And it is he himself who makes himself impious and displeasing to\r\nGod, not suffering evil from God, for the Divinity does only what is good.\r\nIt is the man himself who causes his evils by his false beliefs in regard\r\nto God. The impious is not so much he who does not honor the statues of\r\nthe gods as he who mixes up with the idea of God the superstitions of the\r\nvulgar. As for thyself, do not hold any unworthy idea of God, of his\r\nblessedness or of his incorruptibility.\r\n\r\nCh. 18. The greatest fruit of piety is this—to honor the Deity according\r\nto our fatherland; not that He has need of anything, but His holy and\r\nhappy Majesty invites us to offer Him our homage. Altars consecrated to\r\nGod do no harm, and when neglected they render no help. But he who honors\r\nGod as needing anything declares, without knowing it, that he is superior\r\nto God. Therefore it is not angering God that harms us, but not knowing\r\nGod, for wrath is alien to God, because it is the product of the\r\ninvoluntary, and there is nothing involuntary in God. Do not then dishonor\r\nthe Divinity by human false opinions, for thou wilt not thereby injure the\r\nBeing enjoying eternal blessedness, from whose incorruptible nature every\r\ninjury is repelled.\r\n\r\nCh. 19. But thou shouldest not think that I say these things when I exhort\r\nto the worship of God; for he who exhorts to this would be ridiculous; as\r\nif it were possible to doubt concerning this; and we do not worship Him\r\naright doing this thing or thinking that about God.(69) Neither tears nor\r\nsupplications turn God from His purpose; nor do sacrifices honor God, nor\r\nthe multitude of offerings glorify God, but the godlike mind well governed\r\nenters into union with God. For like is of necessity joined to like. But\r\nthe victims of the senseless crowd are food for the flames, and their\r\nofferings are the supplies for a licentious life to the plunderers of\r\ntemples. But, as I have said to thee, let the mind within thee be the\r\ntemple of God. This must be tended and adorned to become a fit dwelling\r\nfor God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. The First General Persecution And Its Consequences\r\n\r\n\r\nOn account of various principles of the Roman law, Christians were always\r\nliable to severe penalties, and parts of the Church occasionally suffered\r\nfearfully. But it was only in exceptional cases and sporadically that the\r\nlaws were enforced. There was, accordingly, no prolonged and systematic\r\neffort made to put down Christianity everywhere until the reign of Decius\r\n(249-251). The renewed interest in heathen religions and the revived\r\npatriotism in some circles occasioned in 248 by the celebration of the\r\nthousandth anniversary of the founding of Rome may have contributed to a\r\nrenewal of hostilities against the Church. Decius undertook the military\r\ndefence of the frontier. His colleague, Valerian, had charge of the\r\ninternal affairs of the Empire and was the author of the measures against\r\nthe Christians. Because the Church included many who had embraced the\r\nfaith in the long period when the Church rarely felt the severity of the\r\nlaws, many were unable to endure the persecution, and so apostatized or\r\n“fell.” The persecution continued only for a short time in full intensity,\r\nbut it was not abandoned for a number of years. It became violent once\r\nmore when Valerian became Emperor (253-260). One result of the\r\npersecutions was the rise of serious disputes, and even schisms, from\r\ndifferences regarding the administration of discipline by the bishops. In\r\nthe case of the Novatians at Rome, a dissenting Church which spread\r\nrapidly over the Empire came into existence and lasted for more than two\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 45. The Decian-Valerian Persecution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first persecution which may fairly be said to have been general in\r\npurpose and effect was that falling in the reigns of Decius (249-251) and\r\nValerian (253-260). Of the course of the persecution we have information\r\nbearing directly upon Carthage, Alexandria, and Asia Minor. But it\r\nprobably was felt very generally throughout the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Cyprian, _De Lapsis_, Epp. 14, 22, 43;\r\n    Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VI, 39-45, VII, 11, 15, 30: for original\r\n    texts see Preuschen, _Analecta_, I, §§ 16, 17; also R. Knopf,\r\n    _Ausgewählte Märtyreracten_ (of these the most reliable are the\r\n    martyrdom of Pionius and of Cyprian).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Origen, _Contra Celsum_, III, 15. (MSG, 11:937.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Origen, writing about 248, observes the probable approach of a\r\n    period of persecution for the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat it is not the fear of external enemies which strengthens our union is\r\nplain from the fact that this cause, by God’s will, has already ceased for\r\na considerable time. And it is probable that the secure existence, so far\r\nas this life is concerned, which is enjoyed by believers at present will\r\ncome to an end, since those who in every way calumniate the Word [_i.e._,\r\nChristianity] are again attributing the frequency of rebellion to the\r\nmultitude of believers and to their not being persecuted by the\r\nauthorities, as in former times.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Lactantius, _De Mortibus Persecutorum_, 3, 4. (MSL, 7:200.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lucius Cælius Firminianus Lactantius was of African birth. Having\r\n    obtained some local fame as a teacher of rhetoric, he was\r\n    appointed by Diocletian professor of that subject in his new\r\n    capital of Nicomedia. This position Lactantius lost during the\r\n    Diocletian persecution. He was afterward tutor of Crispus, the son\r\n    of Constantine. His work _On the Death of the Persecutors_ is\r\n    written in a bitter spirit, but excellent style. Although in some\r\n    circles it has been customary to impeach the veracity of\r\n    Lactantius, no intentional departure from historical truthfulness,\r\n    apart from rhetorical coloring, which was inevitable, has been\r\n    proved against him. Of late there has been some doubt as to the\r\n    authorship of _De Mortibus Persecutorum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 3. … This long peace, however, was afterward interrupted.\r\n\r\nCh. 4. For after many years there appeared in the world an accursed wild\r\nbeast, Decius by name, who should afflict the Church. And who but a bad\r\nman would persecute righteousness? As if for this end he had been raised\r\nup to sovereign eminence, he began at once to rage against God, and at\r\nonce to fall. For having undertaken an expedition against the Carpi, who\r\nhad then occupied Dacia and Mœsia, he was suddenly surrounded by the\r\nbarbarians, and slain, together with a great part of his army; nor could\r\nhe be honored with the rights of sepulture, but, stripped and naked, he\r\nlay as food for wild beasts and birds, as became the enemy of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VI, 39. (MSG, 20:660.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Decian persecution and the sufferings of Origen.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecius succeeded Philip, who had reigned seven years. On account of his\r\nhatred of Philip, Decius commenced a persecution of the churches, in which\r\nFabianus suffered martyrdom at Rome, and Cornelius succeeded him in the\r\nepiscopate. In Palestine, Alexander, bishop of the church of Jerusalem,\r\nwas brought again on Christ’s account before the governor’s judgment seat\r\nin Cæsarea, and having acquitted himself nobly in a second confession, was\r\ncast into prison, crowned with the hoary locks of venerable age. And after\r\nhis honorable and illustrious confession at the tribunal of the governor,\r\nhe fell asleep in prison, and Mazabanes became his successor in the\r\nbishopric of Jerusalem. Babylas in Antioch having, like Alexander, passed\r\naway in prison after his confession, Fabius presided over that church.\r\n\r\nBut how many and how great things came upon Origen in the persecution, and\r\nwhat was their final result—as the evil demon marshalled all his forces\r\nand fought against the man with his utmost craft and power, assaulting him\r\nbeyond all others against whom he contended at that time; and what and how\r\nmany things the man endured for the word of Christ—bonds and bodily\r\ntortures and torments under the iron collar and in the dungeon; and how\r\nfor many days with his feet stretched four spaces of the stocks he bore\r\npatiently the threats of fire and whatever other things were inflicted by\r\nhis enemies; and how his sufferings terminated, as his judge strove\r\neagerly with all his might not to end his life; and what words he left\r\nafter these things full of comfort to those needing aid, a great many of\r\nhis epistles show with truth and accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Cyprian, _De Lapsis_, 8-10. (MSL, 4:486.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The many cases of apostasy in the Decian persecution shocked the\r\n    Church inexpressibly. In peace discipline had been relaxed and\r\n    Christian zeal had grown weak. The same phenomena appeared in the\r\n    next great persecution, under Diocletian, after a long period of\r\n    peace. _De Lapsis_ was written in the spring of 251, just after\r\n    the end of the severity of the Decian persecution and Cyprian’s\r\n    return to Carthage. Text in part in Kirch, nn. 227 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 8. From some, alas, all these things have fallen away, and have passed\r\nfrom memory. They indeed did not even wait, that, having been apprehended,\r\nthey should go up, or, having been interrogated, they might deny. Many\r\nwere conquered before the battle, prostrated without an attack. Nor did\r\nthey even leave it to be said for them that they seemed to sacrifice to\r\nidols unwillingly. They ran to the forum of their own accord; freely they\r\nhastened to death, as if they had formerly wished it, as if they would\r\nembrace an opportunity now given which they had always desired. How many\r\nwere put off by the magistrates at that time, when evening was coming on!\r\nHow many even asked that their destruction might not be delayed! What\r\nviolence can such a one plead, how can he purge his crime, when it was he\r\nhimself who rather used force that he might perish? When they came\r\nvoluntarily to the capitol—when they freely approached to the obedience of\r\nthe terrible wickedness—did not their tread falter, did not their sight\r\ndarken, their hearts tremble, their arms fall helplessly down, their\r\nsenses become dull, their tongues cleave to their mouths, their speech\r\nfail? Could the servant of God stand there, he who had already renounced\r\nthe devil and the world, and speak and renounce Christ? Was not that\r\naltar, whither he drew near to die, to him a funeral pile? Ought he not to\r\nshudder at, and flee from, the altar of the devil, which he had seen to\r\nsmoke and to be redolent of a foul stench, as it were, a funeral and\r\nsepulchre of his life? Why bring with you, O wretched man, a sacrifice?\r\nWhy immolate a victim? You yourself have come to the altar an offering,\r\nyourself a victim; there you have immolated your salvation, your hope;\r\nthere you have burned up your faith in those deadly fires.\r\n\r\nCh. 9. But to many their own destruction was not sufficient. With mutual\r\nexhortations the people were urged to their ruin; death was pledged by\r\nturns in the deadly cup. And that nothing might be wanting to aggravate\r\nthe crime, infants, also, in the arms of their parents, being either\r\ncarried or conducted, lost, while yet little ones, what in the very\r\nbeginning of their nativity they had gained. Will not they, when the day\r\nof judgment comes, say: “We have done nothing; nor have we forsaken the\r\nLord’s bread and cup to hasten freely to a profane contract.…”\r\n\r\nCh. 10. Nor is there, alas, any just and weighty reason which excuses such\r\na crime. One’s country was to be left, and loss of one’s estate was to be\r\nsuffered. Yet to whom that is born and dies is there not a necessity at\r\nsome time to leave his country and to suffer loss of his estate? But let\r\nnot Christ be forsaken, so that the loss of salvation and of an eternal\r\nhome should be feared.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Cyprian, _De Lapsis_, 28. (MSL, 4:501.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Those who did not actually sacrifice in the tests that were\r\n    applied to Christians, but by bribery had procured certificates\r\n    that they had sacrificed, were known as _libellatici_. It was to\r\n    the credit of the Christian moral feeling that this subterfuge was\r\n    not admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor let those persons flatter themselves that they need repent the less\r\nwho, although they have not polluted their hands with abominable\r\nsacrifices, yet have defiled their consciences with certificates. That\r\nprofession of one who denies is the testimony of a Christian disowning\r\nwhat he has been. He says he has done what another has actually committed,\r\nand although it is written, “Ye cannot serve two masters” [Matt. 6:24], he\r\nhas served an earthly master in that he has obeyed his edict; he has been\r\nmore obedient to human authority than to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) _A Libellus._ From a papyrus found at Fayum.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The text may be found in Kirch, n. 207. This is the actual\r\n    certificate which a man suspected of being a Christian obtained\r\n    from the commission appointed to carry out the edict of\r\n    persecution. It has been preserved these many centuries in the dry\r\n    Egyptian climate, and is with some others, which are less perfect,\r\n    among the most interesting relics of the ancient Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresented to the Commission for the Sacrifices in the village of Alexander\r\nIsland, by Aurelius Diogenes, the son of Satabus, of the village of\r\nAlexander Island, about seventy-two years of age, with a scar on the right\r\neyebrow.\r\n\r\nI have at other times always offered to the gods as well as also now in\r\nyour presence, and according to the regulations have offered, sacrificed,\r\nand partaken of the sacrificial meal; and I pray you to attest this.\r\nFarewell. I, Aurelius Diogenes, have presented this.\r\n\r\n[In a second hand.]\r\n\r\nI, Aurelius Syrus, testify as being present that Diogenes sacrificed with\r\nus.\r\n\r\n[First hand.]\r\n\r\nFirst year of the Emperor Cæsar Gaius Messius Quintus Trajanus Decius,\r\npious, happy, Augustus, 2d day of Epiphus. [June 25, 250.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Cyprian, _Epistula 80_ (=82). (MSL, 4:442.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The date of this epistle is 257-258, at the outbreak of the\r\n    Valerian persecution, a revival of the Decian. It was therefore\r\n    shortly before Cyprian’s death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCyprian to his brother Successus, greeting. The reason why I write to you\r\nat once, dearest brother, is that all the clergy are placed in the heat of\r\nthe contest and are unable in any way to depart hence, for all of them are\r\nprepared, in accordance with the devotion of their mind, for divine and\r\nheavenly glory. But you should know that those have come back whom I sent\r\nto Rome to find out and bring us the truth concerning what had in any\r\nmanner been decreed respecting us. For many, various, and uncertain things\r\nare currently reported. But the truth concerning them is as follows:\r\nValerian has sent a rescript to the Senate, to the effect that bishops,\r\npresbyters, and deacons should be immediately punished; but that senators,\r\nmen of rank, and Roman knights should lose their dignity and be deprived\r\nof their property; and if, when their property has been taken away, they\r\nshould persist in being Christians, that they should then also lose their\r\nheads; but that matrons should be deprived of their property and banished.\r\nMoreover, people of Cæsar’s household, who had either confessed before or\r\nshould now confess, should have their property confiscated, and be sent in\r\nchains and assigned to Cæsar’s estates. The Emperor Valerian also added to\r\nhis address a copy of the letters he prepared for the presidents of the\r\nprovinces coercing us. These letters we are daily hoping will come, and we\r\nare waiting, according to the strength of our faith, for the endurance of\r\nsuffering and expecting from the help and mercy of the Lord the crown of\r\neternal life. But know that Sixtus was punished [_i.e._, martyred] in the\r\ncemetery on the eighth day of the ides of August, and with him four\r\ndeacons. The prefects of the city, furthermore, are daily urging on this\r\npersecution; so that if any are presented to them they are punished and\r\ntheir property confiscated.\r\n\r\nI beg that these things be made known by you to the rest of our\r\ncolleagues, that everywhere by their exhortations the brotherhood may be\r\nstrengthened and prepared for the spiritual conflict, that every one may\r\nthink less of death than of immortality, and dedicated to the Lord with\r\nfull faith and courage, they may rejoice rather than fear in this\r\nconfession, wherein they know that the soldiers of God and Christ are not\r\nslain, but crowned. I bid you, dearest brother, ever farewell in the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 46. Effects of the Persecution upon the Inner Life of the Church\r\n\r\n\r\nThe persecution developed the popular opinion of the superior sanctity of\r\nmartyrdom. This was itself no new idea, having grown up in the Church from\r\nthe time of Ignatius of Antioch, but it now received new applications and\r\ndevelopments (_a_, _b_). See also § 42, _d_, and below for problems\r\narising from the place the martyrs attempted to take in the organization\r\nof the Church and the administration of discipline. This claim of the\r\nmartyrs was successfully overcome by the bishops, especially under\r\nCyprian’s leadership and example. But in the administration of discipline\r\nthere were sure to arise difficulties and questions, _e.g._, Was there a\r\ndistinction to be made in favor of those who had escaped without actually\r\nsacrificing? (_c_). No matter what policy was followed by the bishop,\r\nthere was the liability of the rise of a party in opposition to him. If he\r\nwas strict, a party advocating laxity appeared, as in the case of\r\nFelicissimus at Carthage; if he was milder in policy, a party would call\r\nfor greater rigor, as in the case of Novatian at Rome (_e_).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Cyprian, _Ep._ 39-45, 51 (ANF, V);\r\n    Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VI, 43, 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Origen, _Exhortatio ad Martyrium_, 30, 50. (MSG, 11:601, 636.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    An estimate of the importance and value of martyrdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Exhortation to Martyrdom_ was addressed by Origen to his\r\n    friend and patron Ambrosius, and to Protoctetus, a presbyter of\r\n    Cæsarea, who were in great danger during the persecution\r\n    undertaken by Maximinus Thrax (235-238). It was probably written\r\n    in the reign of that Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 30. We must remember that we have sinned and that it is impossible to\r\nobtain forgiveness of sins without baptism, and that according to the\r\nevangelical laws it is impossible to be baptized a second time with water\r\nand the Spirit for the forgiveness of sins, and therefore the baptism of\r\nmartyrdom is given us. For thus it has been called, as may be clearly\r\ngathered from the passage: “Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of, and\r\nbe baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” [Mark 10:38]. And\r\nin another place it is said: “But I have a baptism to be baptized with;\r\nand how am I straightened until it be accomplished!” [Luke 12:50]. For be\r\nsure that just as the expiation of the cross was for the whole world, it\r\n(the baptism of martyrdom) is for the cure of many who are thereby\r\ncleansed. For as according to the law of Moses those placed near the altar\r\nare seen to minister forgiveness of sins to others through the blood of\r\nbulls and goats, so the souls of those who have suffered on account of the\r\ntestimony of Jesus are not in vain near that altar in heaven [_cf._ Rev.\r\n6:9 _ff._], but minister forgiveness of sins to those who pray. And at the\r\nsame time we know that just as the high priest, Jesus Christ, offered\r\nhimself as a sacrifice, so the priests, of whom He is the high priest,\r\noffer themselves as sacrifices, and on account of this sacrifice they are\r\nat the altar as in their proper place.\r\n\r\nCh. 50. Just as we have been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ,\r\nwho received the name that is above every name, so by the precious blood\r\nof the martyrs will others be redeemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Origen, _Homil. ad Num._, X, 2. (MSG, 12:658.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of Origen’s homilies on the Pentateuch only a few fragments of the\r\n    Greek text remain. We have them, however, in a Latin translation\r\n    or paraphrase made by Rufinus. The twenty-eight homilies on\r\n    Numbers were written after A. D. 244.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the martyrs, the Apostle John writes in the Apocalypse that the\r\nsouls of those who have been slain for the name of the Lord Jesus are\r\npresent at the altar; but he who is present at the altar is shown to\r\nperform the duties of priest. But the duty of a priest is to make\r\nintercession for the sins of the people. Wherefore I fear, lest,\r\nperchance, inasmuch as there are made no martyrs, and sacrifices of saints\r\nare not offered for our sins, we will not receive remission of our sins.\r\nAnd therefore I fear, lest our sins remaining in us, it may happen to us\r\nwhat the Jews said of themselves, that not having an altar, nor a temple,\r\nnor priesthood, and therefore not offering sacrifices, our sins remain in\r\nus, and so no forgiveness is obtained.… And therefore the devil, knowing\r\nthat remission of sins is obtained by the passion of martyrdom, is not\r\nwilling to raise public persecutions against us by the heathen.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Cyprian, _Epistula 55_, 14 (=51). (MSL, 3:805.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The opinion of the Church as to the _libellatici_. The date is 251\r\n    or 252.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince there is much difference between those who have sacrificed, what a\r\nwant of mercy it is, and how bitter is the hardship, to associate those\r\nwho have received certificates with those who have sacrificed, when he who\r\nhas received the certificate may say, “I had previously read and had been\r\ninformed by the discourse of the bishop that we ought not to sacrifice to\r\nidols, that the servant of God ought not to worship images; and therefore\r\nthat I might not do this which is not lawful, when the opportunity of\r\nreceiving a certificate was offered (and I would not have received it, if\r\nthe opportunity had not been offered) I either went or charged some one\r\nother person going to the magistrate to say that I am a Christian, that I\r\nam not allowed to sacrifice, that I cannot come to the devil’s altars, and\r\nthat I will pay a price for this purpose, that I may not do what is not\r\nlawful for me to do”! Now, however, even he who is stained by a\r\ncertificate, after he has learned from our admonitions that he ought not\r\nto have done even this, and though his hand is pure, and no contact of\r\ndeadly food has polluted his lips, yet his conscience is nevertheless\r\npolluted, weeps when he hears us, and laments, and is now admonished for\r\nthe things wherein he has sinned, and having been deceived, not so much by\r\nguilt as by error, bears witness that for another time he is instructed\r\nand prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Epistula pacis_, Cyprian, _Epistula 16_. (MSL, 4:268.) _Cf._ Kirch,\r\nn. 241.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This brief Letter of Peace is a specimen of the forms that were\r\n    being issued by the confessors, and which a party in the Church\r\n    regarded as mandatory upon the bishops. These Cyprian strenuously\r\n    and successfully resisted. See also Cyprian, _Ep. 21_, in ANF, V,\r\n    299.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the confessors to Cyprian, pope,(70) greeting. Know that we all have\r\ngiven peace to those concerning whom an account has been rendered you as\r\nto what they have done since they committed their sin; and we wish to make\r\nthis rescript known through you to the other bishops. We desire you to\r\nhave peace with the holy martyrs. Lucianus has written this, there being\r\npresent of the clergy an exorcist and a lector.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Cyprian, _Epistula 43_, 2, 3. (MSL, 4:342.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The schism of Felicissimus was occasioned by the position taken by\r\n    Cyprian in regard to the admission of the _lapsi_ in the Decian\r\n    persecution. But it was at the same time the outcome of an\r\n    opposition to Cyprian of longer standing, on account of jealousy,\r\n    as he had only recently become a Christian when he was made bishop\r\n    of Carthage.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 2. It has appeared whence came the faction of Felicissimus, on what\r\nroot and by what strength it stood. These men supplied in a former time\r\nencouragements and exhortations to confessors, not to agree with their\r\nbishop, not to maintain the ecclesiastical discipline faithfully and\r\nquietly, according to the Lord’s precepts, not to keep the glory of their\r\nconfession with an uncorrupt and unspotted mode of life. And lest it\r\nshould have been too little to have corrupted the minds of certain\r\nconfessors and to have wished to arm a portion of our broken fraternity\r\nagainst God’s priesthood, they have now applied themselves with their\r\nenvenomed deceitfulness to the ruin of the lapsed, to turn away from the\r\nhealing of their wound the sick and the wounded, and those who, by the\r\nmisfortune of their fall, are less fit and less able to take stronger\r\ncounsels; and having left off prayers and supplications, whereby with long\r\nand continued satisfaction the Lord is to be appeased, they invite them by\r\nthe deceit of a fallacious peace to a fatal rashness.\r\n\r\nCh. 3. But I pray you, brethren, watch against the snares of the devil,\r\nand being careful for your own salvation, guard diligently against this\r\ndeadly deceit. This is another persecution and another temptation. Those\r\nfive presbyters are none other than the five leaders who were lately\r\nassociated with the magistrates in an edict that they might overthrow our\r\nfaith, that they might turn away the feeble hearts of the brethren to\r\ntheir deadly nets by the perversion of the truth. Now the same scheme, the\r\nsame overturning, is again brought about by the five presbyters, linked\r\nwith Felicissimus, to the destruction of salvation, that God should not be\r\nbesought, and that he who has denied Christ should not appeal for mercy to\r\nthe same Christ whom he has denied; that after the fault of the crime\r\nrepentance also should be taken away; and that satisfaction should not be\r\nmade through bishops and priests, but, the Lord’s priests being forsaken,\r\na new tradition of sacrilegious appointment should arise contrary to the\r\nevangelical discipline. And although it was once arranged as well by us as\r\nby the confessors and the clergy of the city,(71) likewise by all the\r\nbishops located either in our province or beyond the sea [_i.e._, Italy],\r\nthat there should be no innovations regarding the case of the lapsed\r\nunless we all assembled in one place, and when our counsels had been\r\ncompared we should then decide upon some moderate sentence, tempered alike\r\nwith discipline and with mercy; against this, our counsel, they have\r\nrebelled and all priestly authority has been destroyed by factious\r\nconspiracies.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Eusebius, _Hist. Ec_., VI, 43. (MSG, 20:616.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The schism of Novatian at Rome was occasioned by the question of\r\n    discipline of the lapsed. While the schism of Felicissimus was in\r\n    favor of more lenient treatment of those who had fallen, the\r\n    schism of Novatian was in favor of greater strictness. The sect of\r\n    Novatians, named after the founder, Novatus or Novatianus, lasted\r\n    for more than two centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovatus [Novatianus], a presbyter at Rome, being lifted up with arrogance\r\nagainst these persons, as if there was no longer for them a hope of\r\nsalvation, not even if they should do all things pertaining to a pure and\r\ngenuine conversion, became the leader of the heresy of those who in the\r\npride of their imagination style themselves Cathari.(72) Thereupon a very\r\nlarge synod assembled at Rome, of bishops in number sixty, and a great\r\nmany more presbyters and deacons; and likewise the pastors of the\r\nremaining provinces deliberated in their places by themselves concerning\r\nwhat ought to be done. A decree, accordingly, was confirmed by all that\r\nNovatus and those who joined with him, and those who adopted his\r\nbrother-hating and inhuman opinion, should be considered by the Church as\r\nstrangers; but that they should heal such of the brethren as had fallen\r\ninto misfortune, and should minister to them with the medicines of\r\nrepentance. There have come down to us epistles of Cornelius, bishop of\r\nRome, to Fabius, of the church at Antioch, which show what was done at the\r\nsynod at Rome, and what seemed best to all those in Italy and Africa and\r\nthe regions thereabout. Also other epistles, written in the Latin\r\nlanguage, of Cyprian and those with him in Africa, by which it is shown\r\nthat they agreed as to the necessity of succoring those who had been\r\ntempted, and of cutting off from the Catholic Church the leader of the\r\nheresy and all that joined him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. The Period Of Peace For The Church: A. D. 260 To A. D. 303\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Decian-Valerian persecution (250-260) the Church enjoyed a long\r\npeace, rarely interrupted anywhere by hostile measures, until the outbreak\r\nof the second great general persecution, under Diocletian (303-313), a\r\nspace of over forty years. In this period the Church cast off the chiliasm\r\nwhich had lingered as a part of a primitive Jewish conception of\r\nChristianity (§ 47), and adapted itself to the actual condition of this\r\npresent world. Under the influence of scientific theology, especially that\r\nof the Alexandrian school, the earlier forms of Monarchianism disappeared\r\nfrom the Church, and the discussion began to narrow down to the position\r\nwhich it eventually assumed in the Arian controversy (§ 48). Corresponding\r\nto the development of the theology went that of the cultus of the Church,\r\nand already in the West abiding characteristics appeared (§ 49). The\r\ncultus and the disciplinary work of the bishops advanced in turn the\r\nhierarchical organization of the Church and the place of the bishops (§\r\n50), but the theory of local episcopal autonomy and the universalistic\r\ntendencies of the see of Rome soon came into sharp conflict (§ 51),\r\nespecially over the validity of baptism administered by heretics (§ 52).\r\nIn this discussion the North African Church assumed a position which\r\nsubsequently became the occasion of the most serious schism of the ancient\r\nChurch, or Donatism. In this period, also, is to be set the rise of\r\nChristian Monasticism as distinguished from ordinary Christian asceticism\r\n(§ 53). At the same time, a dangerous rival of Christianity appeared in\r\nthe East, in the form of Manichæanism, in which were absorbed nearly all\r\nthe remnants of earlier Gnosticism (§ 54).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 47. The Chiliastic Controversy\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the third century the belief in chiliasm as a part of the Church’s\r\nfaith died out in nearly all parts of the Church. It did not seem called\r\nfor by the condition of the Church, which was rapidly adjusting itself to\r\nthe world in which it found itself. The scientific theology, especially\r\nthat of Alexandria, found no place in its system for such an article as\r\nchiliasm. The belief lingered, however, in country places, and with it\r\nwent no little opposition to the “scientific” exegesis which by means of\r\nallegory explained away the promises of a millennial kingdom. The only\r\naccount we have of this so-called “Chiliastic Controversy” is found in\r\nconnection with the history of the schism of Nepos in Egypt given by\r\nEusebius, But it may be safely assumed that the condition of things here\r\ndescribed was not peculiar to any one part of the Church, though an open\r\nschism resulting from the conflict of the old and new ideas is not found\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Origen, _De Principiis_, II, 11 (ANF,\r\n    IV); Lactantius, _Divini Institutiones_, VII, 14-26 (ANF, VII);\r\n    Methodius, _Symposium_, IX, 5 (ANF, VI); _v. infra_, § 48.\r\n\r\n\r\nEusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VII, 24. (MSG, 20:693.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dionysius was bishop of Alexandria 248-265, after serving as the\r\n    head of the Catechetical School, a position which he does not seem\r\n    to have resigned on being advanced to the episcopate. His work _On\r\n    the Promises_ has, with the exception of fragments preserved by\r\n    Eusebius, perished, as has also the work of Nepos, _Against the\r\n    Allegorists_. The date of the work of Nepos is not known. That of\r\n    the work of Dionysius is placed conjecturally at 255. The\r\n    “Allegorists,” against whom Nepos wrote, were probably Origen and\r\n    his school, who developed more consistently and scientifically the\r\n    allegorical method of exegesis; see above, § 43, _k_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides all these, the two books _On the Promises_ were prepared by him\r\n[Dionysius]. The occasion of these was Nepos, a bishop in Egypt, who\r\ntaught that the promises made to the holy men in the divine Scriptures\r\nshould be understood in a more Jewish manner, and that there would be a\r\ncertain millennium of bodily luxury upon this earth. As he thought that he\r\ncould establish his private opinion by the Revelation of John, he wrote a\r\nbook on this subject, entitled _Refutation of Allegorists_. Dionysius\r\nopposes this in his books _On the Promises_. In the first he gives his own\r\nopinion of the dogma; and in the second he treats of the Revelation of\r\nJohn,(73) and, mentioning Nepos at the beginning, writes of him as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“But since they bring forward a certain work of Nepos, on which they rely\r\nconfidently, as if it proved beyond dispute that there will be a reign of\r\nChrist upon earth, I confess that in many other respects I approve and\r\nlove Nepos for his faith and industry and his diligence in the Scriptures,\r\nand for his extensive psalmody with which many of the brethren are still\r\ndelighted; and I hold the man in the more reverence because he has gone\r\nbefore us to rest.… But as some think his work very plausible, and as\r\ncertain teachers regard the law and the prophets as of no consequence, and\r\ndo not follow the Gospels, and treat lightly the apostolic epistles, while\r\nthey make promises as to the teaching of this work as if it were some\r\ngreat hidden mystery, and do not permit our simpler brethren to have any\r\nsublime and lofty thoughts concerning the glorious and truly divine\r\nappearing of our Lord and our resurrection from the dead, and our being\r\ngathered together unto Him, and made like Him, but, on the contrary, lead\r\nthem to a hope for small things and mortal things in the kingdom of God,\r\nand for things such as exist now—since this is the case, it is necessary\r\nthat we should dispute with our brother Nepos as if he were present.”\r\nFarther on he says:\r\n\r\n“When I was in the district of Arsinoe, where, as you know, this doctrine\r\nhas prevailed for a long time, so that schisms and apostasies of entire\r\nchurches have resulted, I called together the presbyters and teachers of\r\nthe brethren in the villages—such brethren as wished being present—and I\r\nexhorted them to make a public examination of this question. Accordingly\r\nwhen they brought me this book, as if it were a weapon and fortress\r\nimpregnable, sitting with them from morning till evening for three\r\nsuccessive days, I endeavored to correct what was written in it.… And\r\nfinally the author and mover of this teaching, who was called Coracion, in\r\nthe hearing of all the brethren present acknowledged and testified to us\r\nthat he would no longer hold this opinion, nor discuss it, nor mention it,\r\nnor teach it, as he was fully convinced by the arguments against it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 48. Theology of the Second Half of the Third Century under the Influence\r\nof Origen\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the second half of the third century theology had become a speculative\r\nand highly technical science (_a_), and under the influence of Origen, the\r\nLogos theology, as opposed to various forms of Monarchianism (_b_), had\r\nbecome universal. Under this influence, Paul of Samosata, reviving\r\nDynamistic Monarchianism, modified it by combining with it elements of the\r\nLogos theology (_c-e_). At the same time there was in various parts of the\r\nChurch a continuation of the Asia Minor theological tradition, such as had\r\nfound expression in Irenæus. A representative of this theology was\r\nMethodius of Olympus (_f_).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Athanasius, _De Sent. Dionysii_ (PNF,\r\n    ser. II, vol. IV).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Gregory Thaumaturgus, _Confession of Faith_. (MSG, 46:912)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gregory Thaumaturgus, or the Wonder-worker, was born about 213 in\r\n    Neo-Cæsarea in Pontus. He studied under Origen at Cæsarea in\r\n    Palestine from 233 to 235, and became one of the leading\r\n    representatives of the Origenistic theology, representing the\r\n    orthodox development of that school, as distinguished from Paul of\r\n    Samosata and Lucian.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following Confession of Faith is found only in the _Life of\r\n    Gregory Thaumaturgus_, by Gregory of Nyssa. (MSG, 46: 909 _f._)\r\n    Its genuineness is now generally admitted; see Hahn, _op. cit._, §\r\n    185. According to a legend, it was communicated to Gregory in a\r\n    vision by St. John on the request of the Blessed Virgin. It\r\n    represents the speculative tendency of Origenism and current\r\n    theology after the rise of the Alexandrian school. It should be\r\n    noted that it differs markedly from other confessions of faith in\r\n    not employing biblical language.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one God, the Father of the living Word, His substantive Wisdom,\r\nPower, and Eternal Image, the perfect Begetter of the perfect One, the\r\nFather of the Only begotten Son.\r\n\r\nThere is one Lord, only One from only One, God from God, the image and\r\nlikeness of the Godhead, the active Word, The Wisdom which comprehends the\r\nconstitution of all things, and the Power which produced all creation; the\r\ntrue Son of the true Father, Invisible of Invisible, and Incorruptible of\r\nIncorruptible, and Immortal of Immortal, and Everlasting of Everlasting.\r\n\r\nAnd there is one Holy Spirit having His existence from God, and manifested\r\nby the Son [namely, to men],(74) the perfect likeness of the perfect Son,\r\nLife and Cause of the living [the sacred Fount], Sanctity, Leader of\r\nsanctification, in whom is revealed God the Father, who is over all and in\r\nall, and God the Son, who is through all; a perfect Trinity(75) not\r\ndivided nor differing in glory and eternity and sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, nothing created or subservient in the Trinity, nor\r\nintroduced as if not there before, but coming afterward; for there never\r\nwas a time when the Son was lacking to the Father, nor the Spirit to the\r\nSon, but the same Trinity is ever unvarying and unchangeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Athanasius, _De Sent. Dionysii_, 4, 5, 6, 13-15. (MSG, 25:484 f.,\r\n497 f.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    What has been called the “Controversy of the two Dionysii” was in\r\n    reality no controversy. Dionysius of Alexandria [_v. supra_, § 48]\r\n    wrote a letter to the Sabellians near Cyrene, pointing out the\r\n    distinction of the Father and the Son. In it he used language\r\n    which was, to say the least, indiscreet. Complaint was made to\r\n    Dionysius, bishop of Rome, that the bishop of Alexandria did not\r\n    hold the right view of the relation of the Son to the Father and\r\n    of the divinity of the Son. Thereupon, Dionysius of Rome wrote to\r\n    Dionysius of Alexandria. In reply, Dionysius of Alexandria pointed\r\n    out at length, in a _Refutation and Defence_, his actual opinion\r\n    on the matter as a whole, rather than as merely opposed to\r\n    Modalistic Monarchianism or Sabellianism. The course of the\r\n    discussion is sufficiently clear from the extracts. Athanasius is\r\n    writing in answer to the Arians, who had appealed to the letter of\r\n    Dionysius in support of their opinion that the Son was a creature,\r\n    and that there was when He was not [_v. infra_, § 63]. His work,\r\n    from which the following extracts are taken, was written between\r\n    350 and 354.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 4. They (the Arians) say, then, that in a letter the blessed Dionysius\r\nhas said: “The Son of God is a creature and made, and not His own by\r\nnature, but in essence alien from the Father, just as the husbandman is\r\nfrom the vine, or the shipbuilder is from the boat; for that, being a\r\ncreature, He was not before He came to be.” Yes. He wrote it, and we, too,\r\nadmit that such was his letter. But as he wrote this, so also he wrote\r\nvery many other epistles, which ought to be read by them, so that from all\r\nand not from one merely the faith of the man might be discovered.\r\n\r\nCh. 5. At that time [_i.e._, when Dionysius wrote against the Sabellians]\r\ncertain of the bishops of Pentapolis in Upper Libya were of the opinion of\r\nSabellius. And they were so successful with their opinion that the Son of\r\nGod was scarcely preached any longer in the churches. Dionysius heard of\r\nthis, as he had charge of those churches (_cf._ Canon 6, Nicæa, 325; see\r\nbelow, § 72), and sent men to counsel the guilty ones to cease from their\r\nfalse doctrine. As they did not cease but waxed more shameless in their\r\nimpiety, he was compelled to meet their shameless conduct by writing the\r\nsaid letter and to define from the Gospels the human nature of the\r\nSaviour, in order that, since those men waxed bolder in denying the Son\r\nand in ascribing His human actions to the Father, he accordingly, by\r\ndemonstrating that it was not the Father but the Son that was made man for\r\nus, might persuade the ignorant persons that the Father is not the Son,\r\nand so by degrees lead them to the true godhead of the Son and the\r\nknowledge of the Father.\r\n\r\nCh. 6. … If in his writings he is inconsistent, let them [_i.e._, the\r\nArians] not draw him to their side, for on this assumption he is not\r\nworthy of credit. But if, when he had written his letter to Ammonius, and\r\nfallen under suspicion, he made his defence, bettering what he had said\r\npreviously, defending himself, but not changing, it must be evident that\r\nhe wrote what fell under suspicion by way of “accommodation.”\r\n\r\nCh. 13. The following is the occasion of his writing the other letters.\r\nWhen Bishop Dionysius had heard of the affairs in Pentapolis and had\r\nwritten in zeal for religion, as I have said, his letter to Euphranor and\r\nAmmonius against the heresy of Sabellius, some of the brethren belonging\r\nto the Church, who held a right opinion, but did not ask him so as to\r\nlearn from himself what he had written, went up to Rome and spake against\r\nhim in the presence of his namesake, Dionysius, bishop of Rome. And the\r\nlatter, upon hearing it, wrote simultaneously against the adherents of\r\nSabellius and against those who held the same opinions for uttering which\r\nArius was cast out of the Church; and he called it an equal and opposite\r\nimpiety to hold with Sabellius or with those who say that the Word of God\r\nis a creature, framed and originated. And he wrote also to Dionysius\r\n[_i.e._, of Alexandria] to inform him of what they had said about him. And\r\nthe latter straightway wrote back and inscribed a book entitled _A\r\nRefutation and a Defence_.\r\n\r\nCh. 14. … In answer to these charges he writes, after certain prefatory\r\nmatter in the first book of the work entitled _A Refutation and a\r\nDefence_, in the following terms:\r\n\r\nCh. 15. “For never was there a time when God was not a Father.” And this\r\nhe acknowledges in what follows, “that Christ is forever, being Word and\r\nWisdom and Power. For it is not to be supposed that God, having at first\r\nno issue, afterward begat a Son. But the Son has his being not of Himself,\r\nbut of the Father.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VII, 27, 29, 30. (MSG, 25:705.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The deposition of Paul of Samosata.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The controversy concerning Paul’s doctrinal views is sufficiently\r\n    set forth in the extract from Eusebius given below. Paul was\r\n    bishop of Antioch from about 260 to 268. His works have perished,\r\n    with the exception of a few fragments. The importance of Paul is\r\n    that in his teaching is to be found an attempt to combine the\r\n    Logos theology of Origen with Dynamistic Monarchianism, with\r\n    results that appeared later in Arianism, on the one hand, and\r\n    Nestorianism, it is thought, on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 27. After Sixtus had presided over the church of Rome eleven years,\r\nDionysius, namesake of him of Alexandria, succeeded him. About that time\r\nDemetrianus died in Antioch, and Paul of Samosata received that\r\nepiscopate. As he held low and degraded views of Christ, contrary to the\r\nteaching of the Church, namely, that in his nature He was a common man,\r\nDionysius of Alexandria was entreated to come to the synod. But being\r\nunable to come on account of age and physical weakness, he gave his\r\nopinion on the subject under consideration by a letter. But the other\r\npastors of the churches assembled from all directions, as against a\r\ndespoiler of the flock of Christ, all making haste to reach Antioch.\r\n\r\nCh. 29. During his [Aurelian’s, 270-275] reign a final synod composed of a\r\ngreat many bishops was held, and the leader of heresy in Antioch was\r\ndetected and his false doctrine clearly shown before all, and he was\r\nexcommunicated from the Catholic Church under heaven. Malchion especially\r\ndrew him out from his hiding-place and refuted him. He was a man learned\r\nalso in other matters, and principal of the sophist school of Grecian\r\nlearning in Antioch; yet on account of the superior nobility of his faith\r\nin Christ he had been made a presbyter of that parish [_i.e._, diocese].\r\nThis man, having conducted a discussion with him, which was taken down by\r\nstenographers, and which we know is still extant, was alone able to detect\r\nthe man who dissembled and deceived others.\r\n\r\nCh. 30. The pastors who had assembled about this matter prepared by common\r\nconsent an epistle addressed to Dionysius, bishop of Rome, and Maximus of\r\nAlexandria, and sent it to all the provinces.…\r\n\r\nAfter other things they describe as follows the manner of life which he\r\nled: “Whereas he has departed from the rule [_i.e._, of faith], and has\r\nturned aside after base and spurious teachings, it is not necessary—since\r\nhe is without—that we should pass judgment upon his practices: as for\r\ninstance … in that he is haughty and is puffed up, and assumes worldly\r\ndignities, preferring to be called ducenarius rather than bishop; and\r\nstruts in the market-places, reading letters and reciting them as he walks\r\nin public, attended by a bodyguard, with a multitude preceding and\r\nfollowing him, so that the faith is envied and hated on account of his\r\npride and haughtiness of heart, … or that he violently and coarsely\r\nassails in public the expounders of the Word that have departed this life,\r\nand magnifies himself, not as bishop, but as a sophist and juggler, and\r\nstops the psalms to our Lord Jesus Christ as being novelties and the\r\nproductions of modern men, and trains women to sing psalms to himself in\r\nthe midst of the church on the great day of the passover.… He is unwilling\r\nto acknowledge that the Son of God came down from heaven. (And this is no\r\nmere assertion, but is abundantly proved from the records which we have\r\nsent you; and not least where he says, ‘Jesus Christ is from below.’)… And\r\nthere are the women, the ‘_subintroductæ_,’ as the people of Antioch call\r\nthem, belonging to him and to the presbyters and deacons with him.\r\nAlthough he knows and has convicted these men, yet he connives at this and\r\ntheir incurable sins, in order that they may be bound to him, and through\r\nfear for themselves may not dare to accuse him for his wicked words and\r\ndeeds.…”\r\n\r\nAs Paul had fallen from the episcopate, as well as from the orthodox\r\nfaith, Domnus, as has been said, succeeded to the service of the church at\r\nAntioch [_i.e._, became bishop]. But as Paul refused to surrender the\r\nchurch building, the Emperor Aurelian was petitioned; and he decided the\r\nmatter most equitably, ordering the building to be given to those to whom\r\nthe bishops of Italy and of the city of Rome should adjudge it. Thus this\r\nman was driven out of the Church, with extreme disgrace, by the worldly\r\npower.\r\n\r\nSuch was Aurelian’s attitude toward us at that time; but in the course of\r\ntime he changed his mind in regard to us, and was moved by certain\r\nadvisers to institute a persecution against us. And there was great talk\r\nabout it everywhere. But as he was about to do it, and was, so to speak,\r\nin the very act of signing the decrees against us, the divine judgment\r\ncame upon him and restrained him at the very verge of his undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Malchion of Antioch, _Disputation with Paul_. (MSG, 10:247-260.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The doctrine of Paul of Samosata.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following fragments are from the disputation of Malchion with\r\n    Paul at the Council of Antioch, 268 [see extract from Eusebius,\r\n    _Hist. Ec._, VII, 27, 29, 30; see above (_c_)], which Malchion is\r\n    said to have revised and published. The passages may be found also\r\n    in Routh, _Reliquiæ Sacræ_, second ed., III, 300 _ff._ Fragments\r\n    I-III are from the work of the Emperor Justinian, _Contra\r\n    Monophysitas_; fragment IV is from the work of Leontius of\r\n    Byzantium, _Adversus Nestorianos et Eutychianos_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Logos became united with Him who was born of David, who is Jesus,\r\nwho was begotten of the Holy Ghost. And Him the Virgin bore by the Holy\r\nSpirit; but God generated that Logos without the Virgin or any one else\r\nthan God, and thus the Logos exists.\r\n\r\nII. The Logos was greater than Christ. Christ became greater through\r\nWisdom, that we might not overthrow the dignity of Wisdom.\r\n\r\nIII. In order that the Anointed, who was from David, might not be a\r\nstranger to Wisdom, and that Wisdom might not dwell so largely in another.\r\nFor it was in the prophets, and more in Moses, and in many the Lord was,\r\nbut more also in Christ as in a temple. For Jesus Christ was one and the\r\nLogos was another.\r\n\r\nIV. He who appeared was not Wisdom, for He could not be found in an\r\noutward form, neither in the appearance of a man; for He is greater than\r\nall things visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Paul of Samosata, _Orationes ad Sabinum_, Routh, _op. cit._, III,\r\n329.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The doctrine of Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Paul’s work addressed to Sabinus has perished with the exception\r\n    of a few fragments. See Routh, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Thou shouldest not wonder that the Saviour had one will with God; for\r\njust as nature shows us a substance becoming one and the same out of many\r\nthings, so the nature of love makes one and the same will out of many\r\nthrough a manifest preference.\r\n\r\nII. He who was born holy and righteous, having by His struggle and\r\nsufferings overcome the sin of our progenitors, and having succeeded in\r\nall things, was united in character to God, since He had preserved one and\r\nthe same effort and aim as He for the promotion of things that are good;\r\nand since He has preserved this inviolate, His name is called that above\r\nevery name, the prize of love having been freely bestowed upon Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Epiphanius, _Panarion_, _Hær._ LXV. (MSG, 42:12.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The doctrine of Paul of Samosata.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Epiphanius was bishop of Salamis, 367-403. His works are chiefly\r\n    polemical and devoted to the refutation of all heresies, of which\r\n    he gives accounts at some length. He is a valuable, though not\r\n    always reliable, source for many otherwise unknown heresies. In\r\n    the present case we have passages from Paul’s own writings that\r\n    confirm and supplement the statements of the hereseologist.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe [Paul of Samosata] says that God the Father and the Son and the Holy\r\nSpirit are one God, that in God is always His Word and His Spirit, as in a\r\nman’s heart is his own reason; that the Son of God does not exist in a\r\nhypostasis, but in God himself.… That the Logos came and dwelt in Jesus,\r\nwho was a man. And thus he says God is one, neither is the Father the\r\nFather, nor the Son the Son, nor the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit, but\r\nrather the one God is Father and in Him is his Son, as the reason is in a\r\nman.… But he did not say with Noetus that the Father suffered, but only,\r\nsaid he, the Logos came and energized and went back to the Father.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Methodius of Olympus, _Symposium_, III, 4, 8. (MSG, 18:65, 73.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The theology of Origen was not suffered to go without being\r\n    challenged by those who could not accept some of his extreme\r\n    statements. Among those opposed to him were Peter, bishop of\r\n    Alexandria, and Methodius, bishop of Olympus. Both were strongly\r\n    influenced by Origen, but the denial of a bodily resurrection and\r\n    the eternity of the creation were too offensive. The more\r\n    important of the two is Methodius, who combined a strong\r\n    anti-Origenistic position on these two points with that\r\n    “recapitulation” theory of redemption which has been called the\r\n    Asia Minor type of theology and is represented also by Irenæus;\r\n    see above, § 27. He has been called the author of the “theology of\r\n    the future,” with reference to his relation to Athanasius, in that\r\n    he laid the foundation for a doctrine of redemption which\r\n    superseded that of the old Alexandrian school, and became\r\n    established in the East under the lead of Athanasius and the\r\n    Nicene divines generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Methodius was bishop of Olympus, in Lycia. The statements that he\r\n    also held other sees are unreliable. He died in 311 as a martyr.\r\n    Nothing else is known with certainty as to his life. Of his\r\n    numerous and well-written works, only one, _The Banquet_, or\r\n    _Symposium_, has been preserved entire. His work _On the\r\n    Resurrection_ is most strongly opposed to Origen and his denial of\r\n    the bodily resurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 4. For let us consider how rightly he [Paul] compared Adam to Christ,\r\nnot only considering him to be the type and image, but also that Christ\r\nHimself became the very same thing, because the Eternal Word fell upon\r\nHim. For it was fitting that the first-born of God, the first shoot, the\r\nOnly begotten, even the Wisdom [of God], should be joined to the\r\nfirst-formed man, and first and first-born of men, and should become\r\nincarnate. And this was Christ, a man filled with the pure and perfect\r\nGodhead, and God received into man. For it was most suitable that the\r\noldest of the Æons and the first of the archangels, when about to hold\r\ncommunion with men, should dwell in the oldest and first of men, even\r\nAdam. And thus, renovating those things which were from the beginning, and\r\nforming them again of the Virgin by the Spirit, He frames the same just as\r\nat the beginning.\r\n\r\nCh. 8. The Church could not conceive believers and give them new birth by\r\nthe laver of regeneration unless Christ, emptying Himself for their sakes,\r\nthat He might be contained by them, as I said, through the recapitulation\r\nof His passion, should die again, coming down from heaven, and, being\r\n“joined to His wife,” the Church, should provide that a certain power be\r\ntaken from His side, so that all who are built up in Him should grow up,\r\neven those who are born again by the laver, receiving of His bones and of\r\nHis flesh; that is, of His holiness and of His glory. For he who says that\r\nthe bones and flesh of Wisdom are understanding and virtue, says most\r\nrightly; and that the side [rib] is the Spirit of truth, the Paraclete, of\r\nwhom the illuminated [_i.e._, baptized], receiving, are fitly born again\r\nto incorruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Methodius of Olympus, _De Resurrect._, I, 13. (MSG, 18:284.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_De Resur._, I, 13.(76) If any one were to think that the earthly image is\r\nthe flesh itself, but the heavenly image is some other spiritual body\r\nbesides the flesh, let him first consider that Christ, the heavenly man,\r\nwhen He appeared, bore the same form of limbs and the same image of flesh\r\nas ours, through which, also, He, who was not man, became man, that, “as\r\nin Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” For if it was\r\nnot that he might set the flesh free and raise it up that He bore flesh,\r\nwhy did He bear flesh superfluously, as He purposed neither to save it nor\r\nto raise it up? But the Son of God does nothing superfluous. He did not\r\ntake, then, the form of a servant uselessly, but to raise it up and save\r\nit. For He was truly made man, and died, and not in appearance, but that\r\nHe might truly be shown to be the first begotten from the dead, changing\r\nthe earthly into the heavenly, and the mortal into the immortal.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 49. The Development of the Cultus\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church’s cultus and sacramental system developed rapidly in the third\r\ncentury. The beginnings of the administration of the sacraments according\r\nto prescribed forms are to be traced to the Didache and Justin Martyr (see\r\nabove, §§ 13, 14). At the beginning of the third century baptism was\r\nalready accompanied by a series of subsidiary rites, and the eucharist was\r\nregarded as a sacrifice, the benefit of which might be directed toward\r\nspecific ends. The further development was chiefly in connection with the\r\neucharist, which effected in turn the conception of the hierarchy (see\r\nbelow, § 50). Baptism was regarded as conferring complete remission of\r\nprevious sins; subsequent sins were atoned for in the penitential\r\ndiscipline (see above, § 42). As for the eucharist, the conception of the\r\nsacrifice which appears in the Didache, an offering of praise and\r\nthanksgiving, gradually gives place to a sacrifice which in some way\r\npartakes of the nature of Christ’s sacrificial death upon the cross. At\r\nthe same time, the elements are more and more completely identified with\r\nthe body and blood of Christ, and the nature of the presence of Christ is\r\nconceived under quasi-physical categories. As representatives of the lines\r\nof development, Tertullian, at the beginning of the century, and Cyprian,\r\nat the middle, may be taken. That a similar development took place in the\r\nEast is evident, not only from the references to the same in the writings\r\nof Origen and others, but also from the appearance in the next century of\r\nelaborate services, or liturgies, as well as the doctrinal statements of\r\nwriters generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Tertullian, _De Corona_, 3. (MSL, 2:98.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The ceremonies connected with baptism.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd how long shall we draw the saw to and fro through this line when we\r\nhave an ancient practice which by anticipation has settled the state of\r\nthe question? If no passage of Scripture has prescribed it, assuredly\r\ncustom, which without doubt flowed from tradition, has confirmed it. For\r\nhow can anything come into use if it has not first been handed down? Even\r\nin pleading tradition written authority, you say, must be demanded. Let us\r\ninquire, therefore, whether tradition, unless it be written, should not be\r\nadmitted. Certainly we shall say that it ought not to be admitted if no\r\ncases of other practices which, without any written instrument, we\r\nmaintain on the ground of tradition alone, and the countenance thereafter\r\nof custom, affords us any precedent. To deal with this matter briefly, I\r\nshall begin with baptism. When we are going to enter the water, but a\r\nlittle before, in the church and under the hand of the president, we\r\nsolemnly profess that we renounce the devil, and his pomp, and his angels.\r\nHereupon we are thrice immersed, making a somewhat ampler pledge than the\r\nLord has appointed in the Gospel. Then, when we are taken up (as new-born\r\nchildren), we taste first of all a mixture of milk and honey; and from\r\nthat day we refrain from the daily bath for a whole week. We take also in\r\ncongregations, before daybreak, and from the hands of none but the\r\npresidents, the sacrament of the eucharist, which the Lord both commanded\r\nto be eaten at meal-times, and by all. On the anniversary day we make\r\nofferings for the dead as birthday honors. We consider fasting on the\r\nLord’s Day to be unlawful, as also to worship kneeling. We rejoice in the\r\nsame privilege from Easter to Pentecost. We feel pained should any wine or\r\nbread, even though our own, be cast upon the ground. At every forward step\r\nand movement, at every going in and going out, when we put on our shoes,\r\nat the bath, at table, on lighting the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all\r\nthe ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign\r\n[_i.e._, of the cross].\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Tertullian, _De Baptismo_, 5-8. (MSL, 1:1314.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The whole passage should be read as showing clearly that\r\n    Tertullian recognized the similarity between Christian baptism and\r\n    heathen purifying washings, but referred the effects of the\r\n    heathen rites to evil powers, quite in harmony with the Christian\r\n    admission of the reality of heathen divinities as evil powers and\r\n    heathen exorcisms as wrought by the aid of evil spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 5. … Thus man will be restored by God to His likeness, for he formerly\r\nhad been after the image of God; the image is counted being in His form\r\n[_in effigie_], the likeness in His eternity [_in æternitate_]. For he\r\nreceives that Spirit of God which he had then received from His afflatus,\r\nbut afterward lost through sin.\r\n\r\nCh. 6. Not that in the waters we obtain the Holy Spirit, but in the water,\r\nunder (the witness of angels) we are cleansed and prepared for the Holy\r\nSpirit.…\r\n\r\nCh. 7. After this, when we have issued from the font, we are thoroughly\r\nanointed with a blessed unction according to the ancient discipline,\r\nwherein on entering the priesthood men were accustomed to be anointed with\r\noil from a horn, wherefore Aaron was anointed by Moses.… Thus, too, in our\r\ncase the unction runs carnally, but profits spiritually; in the same way\r\nas the act of baptism itself is carnal, in that we are plunged in the\r\nwater, but the effect spiritual, in that we are freed from sins.\r\n\r\nCh. 8. In the next place, the hand is laid upon us, invoking and inviting\r\nthe Holy Spirit through benediction.… But this, as well as the former, is\r\nderived from the old sacramental rite in which Jacob blessed his grandsons\r\nborn of Joseph, Ephraim, and Manasses; with his hands laid on them and\r\ninterchanged, and indeed so transversely slanted the one over the other\r\nthat, by delineating Christ, they even portended the future benediction in\r\nChrist. [_Cf._ Gen. 48:13 _f._]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Cyprian, _Ep. ad Cæcilium, Ep. 63_, 13-17. (MSL, 4:395.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The eucharist.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thascius Cæcilius Cyprianus, bishop of Carthage, was born about\r\n    200, and became bishop in 248 or 249. His doctrinal position is a\r\n    development of that of Tertullian, beside whom he may be placed as\r\n    one of the founders of the characteristic theology of North\r\n    Africa. His discussion of the place and authority of the bishop in\r\n    the ecclesiastical system was of fundamental importance in the\r\n    development of the theory of the hierarchy, though it may be\r\n    questioned whether his particular theory of the relation of the\r\n    bishops to each other ever was realized in the Church. For his\r\n    course during the Decian persecution see §§ 45, 46. He died about\r\n    258, in the persecution under Valerian.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the epistle from which the following extract is taken Cyprian\r\n    writes to Cæcilius to point out that it is wrong to use merely\r\n    water in the eucharist, and that wine mixed with water should be\r\n    used, for in all respects we do exactly what Christ did at the\r\n    Last Supper when he instituted the eucharist. In the course of the\r\n    letter, which is of some length, Cyprian takes occasion to set\r\n    forth his conception of the eucharistic sacrifice, which is a\r\n    distinct advance upon Tertullian. The date of the letter is about\r\n    253.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 13. Because Christ bore us all, in that He also bore our sins, we see\r\nthat in the water is understood the people, but in the wine is showed the\r\nblood of Christ. But when in the cup the water is mingled with the wine\r\nthe people is made one with Christ, and the assembly of believers is\r\nassociated and conjoined with Him on whom it believes; which association\r\nand conjunction of water and wine is so mingled in the Lord’s cup that\r\nthat mixture cannot be separated any more. Whence, moreover, nothing can\r\nseparate the Church—that is, the people established in the Church,\r\nfaithfully and firmly continuing in that in which they have believed—from\r\nChrist in such a way as to prevent their undivided love from always\r\nabiding and adhering. Thus, therefore, in consecrating the cup water alone\r\nshould not be offered to the Lord, even as wine alone should not be\r\noffered. For if wine only is offered, the blood of Christ begins to be\r\nwithout us.(77) But if the water alone be offered, the people begin to be\r\nwithout Christ, but when both are mingled and are joined to each other by\r\nan intermixed union, then the spiritual and heavenly sacrament is\r\ncompleted. Thus the cup of the Lord is not, indeed, water alone, nor wine\r\nalone, nor unless each be mingled with the other; just as, on the other\r\nhand, the body of the Lord cannot be flour alone or water alone, nor\r\nunless both should be united and joined together and compacted into the\r\nmass of one bread: in which sacrament our people are shown to be one; so\r\nthat in like manner as many grains are collected and ground and mixed\r\ntogether into one mass and made one bread, so in Christ, who is the\r\nheavenly bread, we may know that there is one body with which our number\r\nis joined and united.\r\n\r\nCh. 14. There is, then, no reason, dearest brother, for any one to think\r\nthat the custom of certain persons is to be followed, who in times past\r\nhave thought that water alone should be offered in the cup of the Lord.\r\nFor we must inquire whom they themselves have followed. For if in the\r\nsacrifice which Christ offered none is to be followed but Christ, we ought\r\ncertainly to obey and do what Christ did, and what He commanded to be\r\ndone, since He himself says in the Gospel: “If ye do whatsoever I command\r\nyou, henceforth I call you not servants, but friends” [John 15:14 _f._].…\r\nIf Jesus Christ, our Lord and God, is Himself the chief priest of God the\r\nFather, and has first offered Himself a sacrifice to the Father, and has\r\ncommanded this to be done in commemoration of Himself, certainly that\r\npriest truly acts in the place of Christ who imitates what Christ did; and\r\nhe then offers a true and full sacrifice in the Church of God to God the\r\nFather when he proceeds to offer it according to what he sees Christ\r\nhimself to have offered.\r\n\r\nCh. 15. But the discipline of all religion and truth is overturned unless\r\nwhat is spiritually prescribed be faithfully observed; unless, indeed, any\r\none should fear in the morning sacrifices lest the taste of wine should be\r\nredolent of the blood of Christ.(78) Therefore, thus the brotherhood is\r\nbeginning to be kept back from the passion of Christ in persecutions by\r\nlearning in the offerings to be disturbed concerning His blood and His\r\nblood-shedding.… But how can we shed our blood for Christ who blush to\r\ndrink the blood of Christ?\r\n\r\nCh. 16. Does any one perchance flatter himself with this reflection—that,\r\nalthough in the morning water alone is seen to be offered, yet when we\r\ncome to supper we offer the mingled cup? But when we sup, we cannot call\r\nthe people together for our banquet that we may celebrate the truth of the\r\nsacrament in the presence of the entire brotherhood. But still it was not\r\nin the morning, but after supper that the Lord offered the mingled cup.\r\nOught we, then, to celebrate the Lord’s cup after supper, that so by\r\ncontinual repetition of the Lord’s Supper we may offer the mingled cup? It\r\nwas necessary that Christ should offer about the evening of the day, that\r\nthe very hour of sacrifice might show the setting and the evening of the\r\nworld as it is written in Exodus: “And all the people of the synagogue of\r\nthe children of Israel shall kill it in the evening.”(79) And again in the\r\nPsalms: “Let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.”(80) But\r\nwe celebrate the resurrection of the Lord in the morning.\r\n\r\nCh. 17. And because we make mention of His passion in all sacrifices (for\r\nthe Lord’s passion is the sacrifice which we offer), we ought to do\r\nnothing else than what He did. For the Scripture says: “For as often as ye\r\neat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show forth the Lord’s death till\r\nHe come.”(81) As often, therefore, as we offer the cup in commemoration of\r\nthe Lord and His passion, let us do what it is known the Lord did.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 50. The Episcopate in the Church\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest name connected with the development of the hierarchical\r\nconception of the Church in the third century is without question Cyprian\r\n(see § 49). He developed the conception of the episcopate beyond the point\r\nit had reached in the hands of Tertullian, to whom the institution was\r\nimportant primarily as a guardian of the deposit of faith and a pledge of\r\nthe continuity of the Church. In the hands of Cyprian the episcopate\r\nbecame the essential foundation of the Church. According to his theory of\r\nthe office, every bishop was the peer of every other bishop and had the\r\nsame duties to his diocese and to the Church as a whole as every other\r\nbishop. No bishop had any more than a moral authority over any other. Only\r\nthe whole body of bishops, or the council, could bring anything more than\r\nmoral authority to bear upon an offending prelate. The constitution of the\r\ncouncil was not as yet defined. In several points the ecclesiastical\r\ntheories of Cyprian were not followed by the Church as a whole, notably\r\nhis opinion regarding heretical baptism (see § 47), but his main\r\ncontention as to the importance of the episcopate for the very existence\r\n(_esse_), and not the mere welfare (_bene esse_), of the Church was\r\nuniversally accepted. His theory of the equality of all bishops was a\r\nsurvival of an earlier period, and represented little more than his\r\npersonal ideal. The following sections should also be consulted in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Cyprian deals with the hierarchical\r\n    constitution in almost every epistle; see, however, especially the\r\n    following: 26:1 [33:1], 51:24 [55:24], 54:5 [59:5], 64:3 [3:3],\r\n    72:21 [73:21], 74:16 [75:16] (important for the testimony of\r\n    Firmilian as to the hierarchical ideas in the East). _Serapion’s\r\n    Prayer Book_, trans. by J. Wordsworth, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Cyprian, _Epistula 68_, 8 [=66]. (MSL, 4:418.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough a rebellious and arrogant multitude of those who will not obey\r\ndepart, yet the Church does not depart from Christ; and they are the\r\nChurch who are a people united to the priest, and the flock which adheres\r\nto its pastor. Whence you ought to know that the bishop is in the Church\r\nand the Church in the bishop; and that if any one be not with the bishop,\r\nhe is not in the Church, and that those flatter themselves in vain who\r\ncreep in, not having peace with God’s priests, and think that they\r\ncommunicate secretly with some; while the Church, which is Catholic and\r\none, is not cut nor divided, but is indeed connected and bound together by\r\nthe cement of the priests who cohere with one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Council of Carthage, A. D. 256. (MSL, 3:1092.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The council of Carthage, in 256, was held, under the presidency of\r\n    Cyprian, to act on the question of baptism by heretics. See § 52.\r\n    Eighty-seven bishops were present. The full report of proceedings\r\n    is to be found in the works of Cyprian. See ANF, V, 565, and\r\n    Hefele, § 6. The theory of Cyprian which is here expressed is that\r\n    all bishops are equal and independent, as opposed to the Roman\r\n    position taken by Stephen, and that the individual bishop is\r\n    responsible only to God.\r\n\r\n\r\nCyprian said: … It remains that upon this matter each of us should bring\r\nforward what he thinks, judging no man, nor rejecting from the right of\r\ncommunion, if he should think differently. For neither does any one of us\r\nset himself up as a bishop of bishops, nor by tyrannical terrors does any\r\none compel his colleagues to the necessity of obedience; since every\r\nbishop, according to the allowance of his liberty and power, has his own\r\nproper right of judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he\r\nhimself can judge another. But let us all wait for the judgment of our\r\nLord Jesus Christ, who alone has the power of advancing us in the\r\ngovernment of His Church, and of judging us in our conduct here.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Cyprian, _Epistula_ 67:5. (MSL, 3:1064.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following epistle was written to clergy and people in Spain,\r\n    _i.e._, at Leon, Astorga, and Merida, in regard to the ordination\r\n    of two bishops, Sabinus and Felix, in place of Basilides and\r\n    Martial, who had lapsed in the persecution and had been deprived\r\n    of their sees. The passage illustrates the methods of election and\r\n    ordination of bishops, and the failure of Cyprian, with his theory\r\n    of the episcopate, to recognize in the see of Rome any\r\n    jurisdiction over other bishops. Its date appears to be about 257.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must diligently observe and keep the practice delivered from divine\r\ntradition and apostolic observance, which is also maintained among us, and\r\nthroughout almost all the provinces: that for the proper celebration of\r\nordinations all the neighboring bishops of the same province should\r\nassemble with that people for which a prelate is ordained. And the bishops\r\nshould be chosen in the presence of the people, who have most fully known\r\nthe life of each one, and have looked into the doings of each one as\r\nrespects his manner of life. And this also, we see, was done by you in the\r\nordination of our colleague Sabinus; so that, by the suffrage of the whole\r\nbrotherhood, and by the sentence of the bishops who had assembled in their\r\npresence, and who had written letters to you concerning him, the\r\nepiscopate was conferred upon him, and hands were imposed on him in the\r\nplace of Basilides. Neither can an ordination properly completed be\r\nannulled, so that Basilides, after his crimes had been discovered and his\r\nconscience made bare, even by his own confession, might go to Rome and\r\ndeceive Stephen, our colleague, who was placed at a distance and was\r\nignorant of what had been done, so as to bring it about that he might be\r\nreplaced unjustly in the episcopate from which he had been justly deposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 51. The Unity of the Church and the See of Rome\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the third century there were in sharp conflict two\r\ndistinct and opposed theories of Church unity: the theory that the unity\r\nwas based upon adherence to and conformity with the see of Peter; and the\r\ntheory that the episcopate was itself one, and that each bishop shared\r\nequally in it. The unity was either in one see or in the less tangible\r\nunity of an order of the hierarchy. The former was the theory of the Roman\r\nbishops; the latter, the theory of Cyprian of Carthage, and possibly of a\r\nnumber of other ecclesiastics in North Africa and Asia Minor. Formerly\r\npolemical theology made the study of this point difficult, at least with\r\nanything like impartiality. In the passage given below from Cyprian’s\r\ntreatise _On the Unity of the Catholic Church_ the text of the Jesuit\r\nFather Kirch is followed in the most difficult and interpolated chapter 4.\r\nAs Father Kirch gives the text it is perfectly consistent with the theory\r\nof Cyprian as he has elsewhere stated it, and that the interpolated text\r\nis not. See, however, P. Battifol, _Primitive Catholicism_, Lond., 1911,\r\nExcursus E.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: _V. supra_, § 27; also Mirbt, §§\r\n    56-69. The little treatise _De Aleatoribus_ (MSL, 4: 827), from\r\n    which Mirbt gives an extract (n. 71), might be cited in this\r\n    connection, but its force depends upon its origin. It is wholly\r\n    uncertain that it was written either by a bishop of Rome or in\r\n    Italy. _Cf._ Bardenhewer. Kirch also gives the text in part, n.\r\n    276; for other references, see Kirch.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Cyprian, _De Catholicæ Ecclesiæ Unitate_, 4, 5. (MSL, 4:513.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The tract entitled _On the Unity of the Catholic Church_ is the\r\n    most famous of Cyprian’s works. As the theory there developed is\r\n    opposed to that which became dominant, and as Cyprian was regarded\r\n    as the great upholder of the Church’s constitution, interpolations\r\n    were early made in the text which seriously distort the sense.\r\n    These interpolations are to-day abandoned by all scholars. The\r\n    best critical edition of the works of Cyprian is by W. von Hartel\r\n    in the CSEL, but critical texts of the following passage with\r\n    references to literature and indication of interpolations may be\r\n    found in Mirbt (Prot.), n. 52, and in Kirch (R. C.), n. 234\r\n    (chapter 4 only).\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 4. The Lord speaks to Peter, saying: “I say unto thee, that thou art\r\nPeter; and upon this rock I will build my Church and the gates of hell\r\nshall not prevail against it. I will give thee the keys of the Kingdom of\r\nHeaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound also in\r\nheaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed also in\r\nheaven” (Matt. 16:18, 19). [To the same He says after His resurrection:\r\n“Feed my sheep” (John 21:15). Upon him He builds His Church, and to him He\r\ncommits His sheep to be fed, and although. _Interpolation._] Upon one he\r\nbuilds the Church, although also to all the Apostles after His\r\nresurrection He gives an equal power and says, “As the Father has sent me,\r\nI also send you: receive ye the Holy Ghost: whosesoever sins ye retain,\r\nthey shall be retained” (John 20:21); yet, that He might show the unity,\r\n[He founded one see. _Interpolation._] He arranged by His authority the\r\norigin of that unity as beginning from one. Assuredly the rest of the\r\nApostles were also what Peter was, with a like partnership both of honor\r\nand power; but the beginning proceeds from unity [and the primacy is given\r\nto Peter. _Interpolation._], that there might be shown to be one Church of\r\nChrist [and one see. And they are all shepherds, but the flock is shown to\r\nbe one which is fed by the Apostles with unanimous consent.\r\n_Interpolation._]. Which one Church the Holy Spirit also in the Song of\r\nSongs designates in the person of the Lord and says: “My dove, my spotless\r\none, is but one. She is the only one of her mother, chosen of her that\r\nbare her” (Cant. 6:9). Does he who does not hold this unity of the Church\r\n[unity of Peter. _Corrupt reading._] think that he holds the faith? Does\r\nhe who strives against and resists the Church [who deserts the chair of\r\nPeter. _Interpolation._] trust that he is in the Church, when, moreover,\r\nthe blessed Apostle Paul teaches the same things and sets forth the\r\nsacrament of unity, saying, “There is one body and one spirit, one hope of\r\nyour calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God”? (Eph. 4:4.)\r\n\r\nCh. 5. And this unity we ought to hold firmly and assert, especially we\r\nbishops who preside in the Church, that we may prove the episcopate itself\r\nto be one and undivided. Let no one deceive the brotherhood by a\r\nfalsehood; let no one corrupt the truth by a perfidious prevarication. The\r\nepiscopate is one, each part of which is held by each one in its entirety.\r\nThe Church, also, is one which is spread abroad far and wide into a\r\nmultitude by an increase of fruitfulness. As there are many rays of the\r\nsun, but one light, and many branches of a tree, but one strength based\r\nupon its tenacious root, and since from one spring flow many streams,\r\nalthough the multiplicity seems diffused in the liberality of an\r\noverflowing abundance, yet the unity is still preserved in its source.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Firmilian of Cæesarea, _Ep. ad Cyprianum_, in Cyprian, _Ep. 74_\r\n[=75]. (MSL, 3:1024.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The matter in dispute was the rebaptism of those heretics who had\r\n    received baptism before they conformed to the Church. See § 52. It\r\n    was the burning question after the rise of the Novatian sect.\r\n    Stephen, bishop of Rome (254-257), had excommunicated a number of\r\n    churches and bishops, among them probably Cyprian himself. See the\r\n    epistle of Dionysius to Sixtus of Rome, the successor of Stephen,\r\n    in Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VII, 5. “He” (Stephen) therefore had\r\n    written previously concerning Helenus and Firmilianus and all\r\n    those in Cilicia, Cappadocia, Galatia, and the neighboring\r\n    countries, saying that he would not communicate with them for this\r\n    same cause: namely, that they rebaptized heretics. This attitude\r\n    of Stephen roused no little resentment in the East, as is shown by\r\n    the indignant tone of Firmilian, who recognizes no authority in\r\n    Rome. The text may be found in Mirbt, n. 74, and in part in Kirch,\r\n    n. 274. The epistle of Firmilian is to be found among the epistles\r\n    of Cyprian, to whom it was written.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 2. We may in this matter give thanks to Stephen that it has now\r\nhappened through his unkindness [inhumanity] that we receive proof of your\r\nfaith and wisdom.\r\n\r\nCh. 3. But let these things which were done by Stephen be passed by for\r\nthe present, lest, while we remember his audacity and pride, we bring a\r\nmore lasting sadness on ourselves from the things he has wickedly done.\r\n\r\nCh. 6. That they who are at Rome do not observe those things in all cases\r\nwhich have been handed down from the beginning, and vainly pretend the\r\nauthority of the Apostles, any one may know; also, from the fact that\r\nconcerning the celebration of the day of Easter, and concerning many other\r\nsacraments of divine matters, one may see that there are some diversities\r\namong them, and that all things are not observed there alike which are\r\nobserved at Jerusalem; just as in very many other provinces also many\r\nthings are varied because of the difference of places and names, yet on\r\nthis account there is no departure at all from the peace and unity of the\r\nCatholic Church. And this departure Stephen has now dared to make;\r\nbreaking the peace against you, which his predecessors have always kept\r\nwith you in mutual love and honor, even herein defaming Peter and Paul,\r\nthe blessed Apostles, as if the very men delivered this who in their\r\nepistles execrated heretics and warned us to avoid them. Whence it appears\r\nthat this tradition is human which maintains heretics, and asserts that\r\nthey have baptism, which belongs to the Church alone.\r\n\r\nCh. 17. And in this respect I am justly indignant at this so open and\r\nmanifest folly of Stephen, that he who so boasts of the place of his\r\nepiscopate and contends that he holds the succession of Peter, on whom the\r\nfoundation of the Church was laid, should introduce many other rocks and\r\nestablish new buildings of many churches, maintaining that there is a\r\nbaptism in them by his authority; for those who are baptized, without\r\ndoubt, make up the number of the Church.… Stephen, who announces that he\r\nholds by succession the throne of Peter, is stirred with no zeal against\r\nheretics, when he concedes to them, not a moderate, but the very greatest\r\npower of grace.\r\n\r\nCh. 19. This, indeed, you Africans are able to say against Stephen, that\r\nwhen you knew the truth you forsook the error of custom. But we join\r\ncustom to truth, and to the Romans’ custom we oppose custom, but the\r\ncustom of truth, holding from the beginning that which was delivered by\r\nChrist and the Apostles. Nor do we remember that this at any time began\r\namong us, since it has always been observed here, that we have known none\r\nbut one Church of God, and have accounted no baptism holy except that of\r\nthe holy Church.\r\n\r\nCh. 24. Consider with what want of judgment you dare to blame those who\r\nstrive for the truth against falsehood.(82) … For how many strifes and\r\ndissensions have you stirred up throughout the churches of the whole\r\nworld! Moreover, how great sin have you heaped up for yourself, when you\r\ncut yourself off from so many flocks! For it is yourself that you have cut\r\noff. Do not deceive yourself, since he is really the schismatic who has\r\nmade himself an apostate from the communion of ecclesiastical unity. For\r\nwhile you think that all may be excommunicated by you, you have alone\r\nexcommunicated yourself from all; and not even the precepts of an Apostle\r\nhave been able to mould you to the rule of truth and peace.(83)\r\n\r\nCh. 25. How carefully has Stephen fulfilled these salutary commands and\r\nwarnings of the Apostle, keeping in the first place lowliness of mind and\r\nmeekness! For what is more lowly or meek than to have disagreed with so\r\nmany bishops throughout the whole world, breaking peace with each one of\r\nthem in various kinds of discord: at one time with the Easterns, as we are\r\nsure is not unknown to you; at another time with you who are in the south,\r\nfrom whom he received bishops as messengers sufficiently patiently and\r\nmeekly as not to receive them even to the speech of common conference;\r\nand, even more, so unmindful of love and charity as to command the whole\r\nbrotherhood that no one should receive them into his house, so that not\r\nonly peace and communion, but also a shelter and entertainment were denied\r\nto them when they came. This is to have kept the unity of the Spirit in\r\nthe bond of peace, to cut himself off from the unity of love, and to make\r\nhimself a stranger in all things to his brethren, and to rebel against the\r\nsacrament and the faith with the madness of contumacious discord.… Stephen\r\nis not ashamed to afford patronage to such a position in the Church, and\r\nfor the sake of maintaining heretics to divide the brotherhood; and, in\r\naddition, to call Cyprian a false Christ, and a false Apostle, and a\r\ndeceitful worker, and he, conscious that all these characters are for\r\nhimself, has been in advance of you by falsely objecting to another those\r\nthings which he himself ought to bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 52. Controversy over Baptism by Heretics\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the great persecutions schisms arose in connection with the\r\nadministration of discipline (_cf._ § 46). The schismatics held in general\r\nthe same faith as the main body of Christians. Were the sacraments they\r\nadministered to be regarded, then, as valid in such a sense that when they\r\nconformed to the Catholic Church, which they frequently did, they need not\r\nbe baptized, having once been validly baptized; or should their schismatic\r\nbaptism be regarded as invalid and they be required to receive baptism on\r\nconforming if they had not previously been baptized within the Church? Was\r\nbaptism outside the unity of the Church valid? Rome answered in the\r\naffirmative, admitting conforming schismatics without distinguishing as to\r\nwhere they had been baptized; North Africa answered in the negative and\r\nrequired not, indeed, a second baptism, but claimed that the Church’s\r\nbaptism was alone valid, and that if the person conforming had been\r\nbaptized in schism he had not been baptized at all. This view was shared\r\nby at least some churches in Asia Minor (_cf._ § 51, _b_), and possibly\r\nelsewhere. It became the basis of the Donatist position (_cf._ § 62),\r\nwhich schism shared with the Novatian schism the opinion, generally\r\nrejected by the Church, that the validity of a sacrament depended upon the\r\nspiritual condition of the minister of the sacrament, _e.g._, whether he\r\nwas in schism or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Seventh Council of Carthage (ANF, vol.\r\n    V); Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VII, 7:4-6; Augustine, _De Baptismo\r\n    contra Donatistas_, Bk. III (PNF, ser. I, vol. IV).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Cyprian, _Ep. ad Jubianum_, _Ep._ 73, 7 [=72]. (MSL, 3:1159, 168.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    A portion of this epistle may be found in Mirbt, n. 70.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 7. It is manifest where and by whom the remission of sins can be\r\ngiven, _i.e._, that remission which is given by baptism. For first of all\r\nthe Lord gave the power to Peter, upon whom He built the Church, and\r\nwhence he appointed and showed the source of unity, the power, namely,\r\nthat that should be loosed in heaven which he loosed on earth [John 20:21\r\nquoted]. When we perceive that only they who are set over the Church and\r\nestablished in the Gospel law and in the ordinance of the Lord are allowed\r\nto baptize and to give remission of sins, we see that outside of the\r\nChurch nothing can be bound or loosed, for there there is no one who can\r\neither bind or loose anything.\r\n\r\nCh. 21. Can the power of baptism be greater or of more avail than\r\nconfession, than suffering when one confesses Christ before men, and is\r\nbaptized in his own blood? And yet, even this baptism does not benefit a\r\nheretic, although he has confessed Christ and been put to death outside\r\nthe Church, unless the patrons and advocates of heretics [_i.e._, those\r\nwhom Cyprian is opposing] declare that the heretics who are slain in a\r\nfalse confession of Christ are martyrs, and assign to them the glory and\r\nthe crown of martyrdom contrary to the testimony of the Apostle, who says\r\nthat it will profit them nothing although they are burned and slain. But\r\nif not even the baptism of a public confession and blood can profit a\r\nheretic to salvation, because there is no salvation outside of the Church,\r\nhow much less shall it benefit him if, in a hiding-place and a cave of\r\nrobbers stained with the contagion of adulterous waters, he has not only\r\nnot put off his old sins, but rather heaped up still newer and greater\r\nones! Wherefore baptism cannot be common to us and to heretics, to whom\r\nneither God the Father nor Christ the Son, nor the Holy Ghost, nor the\r\nfaith, nor the Church itself is common. And wherefore they ought to be\r\nbaptized who come from heresy to the Church, so that they who are prepared\r\nand receive the lawful and true and only baptism of the holy Church, by\r\ndivine regeneration for the kingdom of God may be born of both sacraments,\r\nbecause it is written: “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit,\r\nhe cannot enter the kingdom of God” [John 3:5].\r\n\r\nCh. 26. These things, dearest brother, we have briefly written to you\r\naccording to our modest abilities, prescribing to none and prejudging\r\nnone, so as to prevent any one of the bishops doing what he thinks well,\r\nand having the free exercise of his judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Cyprian, _Ep. ad Magnum_, _Ep._ 75 [=69]. (MSL, 3:1183.) _Cf._\r\nMirbt, n. 67.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith your usual diligence you have consulted my poor intelligence, dearest\r\nson, as to whether, among other heretics, they also who come from Novatian\r\nought, after his profane washing, to be baptized and sanctified in the\r\nCatholic Church, with the lawful, true, and only baptism of the Church. In\r\nanswer to this question, as much as the capacity of my faith and the\r\nsanctity and truth of the divine Scriptures suggest, I say that no\r\nheretics and schismatics at all have any right to power. For which reason\r\nNovatian, since he is without the Church and is acting in opposition to\r\nthe peace and love of Christ, neither ought to be, nor can be, omitted\r\nfrom being counted among the adversaries and antichrists. For our Lord\r\nJesus Christ, when He declared in His Gospel that those who were not with\r\nHim were His adversaries, did not point out any species of heresy, but\r\nshowed that all who were not with Him, and who were not gathering with\r\nHim, were scattering His flock, and were His adversaries, saying: “He that\r\nis not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me\r\nscattereth” [Luke 11:23]. Moreover, the blessed Apostle John distinguished\r\nno heresy or schism, neither did he set down any specially separated, but\r\nhe called all who had gone out from the Church, and who acted in\r\nopposition to the Church, antichrists, saying, “Ye have heard that\r\nAntichrist cometh, and even now are come many antichrists; wherefore we\r\nknow that this is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not\r\nof us, for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us” [I\r\nJohn 2:18 _f._]. Whence it appears that all are adversaries of the Lord\r\nand are antichrists who are known to have departed from the charity and\r\nfrom the unity of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 53. The Beginnings of Monasticism\r\n\r\n\r\nAsceticism in some form is common to almost all religions. It was\r\npractised extensively in early Christianity and ascetics of both sexes\r\nwere numerous. This asceticism, in addition to a life largely devoted to\r\nprayer and fasting, was marked by refraining from marriage. But these\r\nascetics lived in close relations with those who were non-ascetics.\r\nMonasticism is an advance upon this earlier asceticism in that it attempts\r\nto create, apart from non-ascetics, a social order composed only of\r\nascetics in which the ascetic ideals may be more successfully realized.\r\nThe transition was made by the hermit life in which the ascetic lived\r\nalone in deserts and other solitudes. This became monasticism by the union\r\nof ascetics for mutual spiritual aid. This advance is associated with St.\r\nAnthony. See also Pachomius, in § 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Pseudo-Clement. _De Virginitate_ (ANF,\r\n    VIII, 53); Methodius, _Symposium_ (ANF, VI, 309); the _Lausiac\r\n    History of Palladius_, E. C. Butler, _Texts and Studies_,\r\n    Cambridge, 1898; _Paradise, or Garden of the Holy Fathers_, trans.\r\n    by E. A. W. Budge, London, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nAthanasius, _Vita S. Antonii_, 2-4, 44. (MSG, 26:844, 908.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Anthony, although not the first hermit, gave such an impetus to\r\n    the ascetic life and did so much to bring about some union of\r\n    ascetics that he has been popularly regarded as the founder of\r\n    monasticism. He died 356, at the age of one hundred and five. His\r\n    _Life_, by St. Athanasius, although formerly attacked, is a\r\n    genuine, and, on the whole, trustworthy account of this remarkable\r\n    man. It was written either 357 or 365, and was translated into\r\n    Latin by Evagrius of Antioch (died 393). Everywhere it roused the\r\n    greatest enthusiasm for monasticism. The _Life of St. Paul of\r\n    Thebes_, by St. Jerome, is of very different character, and of no\r\n    historical value.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 2. After the death of his parents, Anthony was left alone with one\r\nlittle sister. He was about eighteen or twenty years old, and on him\r\nrested the care of both the home and his sister. Now it happened not six\r\nmonths after the death of his parents, and when he was going, according to\r\ncustom, into the Lord’s house, and was communing with himself, that he\r\nreflected as he walked how the Apostles left all and followed the Saviour,\r\nand how, in the Acts, men sold their possessions and brought and laid them\r\nat the Apostles’ feet for distribution to the needy, and what and how\r\ngreat a hope was laid up for them in heaven. While he was reflecting on\r\nthese things he entered the church, and it happened that at that time the\r\nGospel was being read, and he heard the Lord say to the rich man: “If thou\r\nwouldest be perfect, go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor; and\r\ncome and follow me and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.” Anthony, as\r\nthough God had put him in mind of the saints and the passage had been read\r\non his account, went out straightway from the Lord’s house, and gave the\r\npossessions which he had from his forefathers to the villagers—they were\r\nthree hundred acres, productive and very fair—that they should be no more\r\na clog upon himself and his sister. And all the rest that was movable he\r\nsold, and, having got together much money, he gave it to the poor,\r\nreserving a little, however, for his sister’s sake.\r\n\r\nCh. 3. And again as he went into the Lord’s house, and hearing the Lord\r\nsay in the Gospel, “Be not anxious for the morrow,” he could stay no\r\nlonger, but went and gave also those things to the poor. He then committed\r\nhis sister to known and faithful virgins, putting her in a convent\r\n[_parthenon_], to be brought up, and henceforth he devoted himself outside\r\nhis house to ascetic discipline, taking heed to himself and training\r\nhimself patiently. For there were not yet many monasteries in Egypt, and\r\nno monk at all knew of the distant desert; but every one of those who\r\nwished to give heed to themselves practised the ascetic discipline in\r\nsolitude near his own village. Now there was in the next village an old\r\nman who had lived from his youth the life of a hermit. Anthony, after he\r\nhad seen this man, imitated him in piety. And at first he began to abide\r\nin places outside the village. Then, if he heard of any good man anywhere,\r\nlike the prudent bee, he went forth and sought him, nor did he turn back\r\nto his own place until he had seen him; and he returned, having got from\r\nthe good man supplies, as it were, for his journey in the way of virtue.\r\nSo dwelling there at first, he steadfastly held to his purpose not to\r\nreturn to the abode of his parents or to the remembrance of his kinsfolk;\r\nbut to keep all his desire and energy for the perfecting of his\r\ndiscipline. He worked, however, with his hands, having heard that “he who\r\nis idle, let him not eat,” and part he spent on bread and part he gave to\r\nthe needy. And he prayed constantly, because he had learned that a man\r\nought to pray in secret unceasingly. For he had given such heed to what\r\nwas read that none of those things that were written fell from him to the\r\nground; for he remembered all, and afterward his memory served him for\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nCh. 4. Thus conducting himself, Anthony was beloved by all. He subjected\r\nhimself in sincerity to the good men he visited, and learned thoroughly\r\nwherein each surpassed him in zeal and discipline. He observed the\r\ngraciousness of one, the unceasing prayer of another; he took knowledge of\r\none’s freedom from anger, and another’s kindliness; he gave heed to one as\r\nhe watched, to another as he studied; one he admired for his endurance,\r\nanother for his fasting and sleeping on the ground; he watched the\r\nmeekness of one, and the long-suffering of another; and at the same time\r\nhe noted the piety toward Christ and the mutual love which animated all.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Athanasius describes Anthony’s removal to the desert and the\r\n    coming of disciples to him, and weaves into his narrative, in the\r\n    form of a speech, a long account of the discipline laid down,\r\n    probably by Anthony himself, chs. 16-43. It is to this long speech\r\n    that the opening words of the following section refers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 44. While Anthony was thus speaking all rejoiced; in some the love of\r\nvirtue increased, in others carelessness was thrown aside, the\r\nself-conceit of others was stopped; and all were persuaded to despise the\r\nassaults of the Evil One, and marvelled at the grace given Anthony from\r\nthe Lord for the discerning of spirits. So their cells were in the\r\nmountains, like tabernacles filled with holy bands of men who sang psalms,\r\nloved reading, fasted, prayed, rejoiced in the hope of things to come,\r\nlabored in almsgiving, and maintained love and harmony with one another.\r\nAnd truly it was possible to behold a land, as it were, set by itself,\r\nfilled with piety and justice. For then there was neither the evil-doer\r\nnor the injured, nor the reproaches of the tax-gatherer; but instead a\r\nmultitude of ascetics, and the one purpose of all was to aim at virtue. So\r\nthat one beholding the cells again and seeing such good order among the\r\nmonks would lift up his voice and say: “How goodly are thy dwellings, O\r\nJacob, and thy tents, O Israel; as shady glens and as a garden by a river;\r\nas tents which the Lord has pitched, and like cedars near the waters”\r\n[Num. 24:5, 6].\r\n\r\nCh. 45. Anthony, however, returned, according to his custom, alone to his\r\ncell, increased his discipline, and sighed daily as he thought of the\r\nmansions of heaven, having his desire fixed on them and pondering over the\r\nshortness of man’s life.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 54. Manichæanism\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last great rival religion to Christianity was Manichæanism, the last\r\nof the important syncretistic religions which drew from Persian and allied\r\nsources. Its connection with Christianity was at first slight and its\r\naffinities were with Eastern Gnosticism. After 280 it began to spread\r\nwithin the Empire, and was soon opposed by the Roman authorities. Yet it\r\nflourished, and, like other Gnostic religions, with which it is to be\r\nclassed, it assimilated more and more of Christianity, until in the time\r\nof Augustine it seemed to many as merely a form of Christianity. On\r\naccount of its general character, it absorbed for the most part what\r\nremained of the earlier Gnostic systems and schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: The most important accessible works\r\n    are the so-called _Acta Archelai_ (ANF, V, 175-235), the\r\n    anti-Manichæan writings of Augustine (PNF, ser. I, vol. IV), and\r\n    Alexander of Lycopolis, _On the Manichæans_ (ANF, VI, 239). On\r\n    Alexander of Lycopolis, see DCB. In the opinion of Bardenhewer,\r\n    Alexander was probably neither a bishop nor a Christian at all,\r\n    but a heathen and a Platonist. Roman edict against Manichæanism in\r\n    Kirch, n. 294.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Nadim, _Fihrist_. (Translation after Kessler, _Mani_, 1889.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Fihrist_, _i.e._, Catalogue, is a sort of history of\r\n    literature made in the eleventh century by the Moslem historian An\r\n    Nadim. In spite of its late date, it is the most important\r\n    authority for the original doctrines of Mani and the facts of his\r\n    life, as it is largely made up from citations from ancient authors\r\n    and writings of Mani and his original disciples.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Life of Mani.\r\n\r\n\r\nMohammed ibn Isak says: Mani was the son of Fatak,(84) of the family of\r\nthe Chaskanier. Ecbatana is said to have been the original home of his\r\nfather, from which he emigrated to the province of Babylon. He took up his\r\nresidence in Al Madain, in a portion of the city known as Ctesiphon. In\r\nthat place was an idol’s temple, and Fatak was accustomed to go into it,\r\nas did also the other people of the place. It happened one day that a\r\nvoice sounded forth from the sacred interior of the temple, saying to him:\r\n“Fatak, eat no flesh, drink no wine and refrain from carnal intercourse.”\r\nThis was repeated to him several times on three days. When Fatak perceived\r\nthis, he joined a society of people in the neighborhood of Dastumaisan\r\nwhich were known under the name of Al-Mogtasilah, _i.e._, those who wash\r\nthemselves, baptists, and of whom remnants are to be found in these parts\r\nand in the marshy districts at the present time. These belonged to that\r\nmode of life which Fatak had been commanded to follow. His wife was at\r\nthat time pregnant with Mani, and when she had given him birth she had, as\r\nthey say, glorious visions regarding him, and even when she was awake she\r\nsaw him taken by some one unseen, who bore him aloft into the air, and\r\nthen brought him down again; sometimes he remained even a day or two\r\nbefore he came down again. Thereupon his father sent for him and had him\r\nbrought to the place where he was, and so he was brought up with him in\r\nhis religion. Mani, in spite of his youthful age, spake words of wisdom.\r\nAfter he had completed his twelfth year there came to him, according to\r\nhis statement, a revelation from the King of the Paradise of Light, who is\r\nGod the Exalted, as he said. The angel which brought him the revelation\r\nwas called Eltawan; this name means “the Companion.” He spoke to Mani, and\r\nsaid: “Separate thyself from this sort of faith, for thou belongest not\r\namong its adherents, and it is obligatory upon you to practise continence\r\nand to forsake the fleshly desires, yet on account of thy youth the time\r\nhas not come for thee to take up thy public work.” But when he was\r\ntwenty-four years old, Eltawan appeared to him and said: “Hail, Mani, from\r\nme and from the Lord who has sent me to thee and has chosen thee to be his\r\nprophet. He commands thee now to proclaim thy truth and on my announcement\r\nto proclaim the truth which is from him and to throw thyself into this\r\ncalling with all thy zeal.”\r\n\r\nThe Manichæans say: He first openly entered upon his work on the day when\r\nSapor, the son of Ardaschir, entered upon his reign, and placed the crown\r\nupon his head; and this was Sunday, the first day of Nisan (March 20,\r\n241), when the sun stood in the sign Aries. He was accompanied by two men,\r\nwho had already attached themselves to his religion; one was called\r\nSimeon, the other Zakwa; besides these, his father accompanied him, to see\r\nhow his affairs would turn out.\r\n\r\nMani said he was the Paraclete, whom Jesus, of blessed memory,(85) had\r\npreviously announced. Mani took the elements of his doctrine from the\r\nreligion of the Magi and Christianity.… Before he met Sapor Mani had spent\r\nabout forty years in foreign lands.(86) Afterward he converted Peroz, the\r\nbrother of Sapor, and Peroz procured him an audience with his brother\r\nSapor. The Manichæans relate: He thereupon entered where he was and on his\r\nshoulders were shining, as it were, two candles. When Sapor perceived him,\r\nhe was filled with reverence for him, and he appeared great in his eyes;\r\nalthough he previously had determined to seize him and put him to death.\r\nAfter he had met him, therefore, the fear of him filled him, he rejoiced\r\nover him and asked him why he had come and promised to become his\r\ndisciple. Mani requested of him a number of things, among them that his\r\nfollowers might be unmolested in the capital and in the other territories\r\nof the Persian Empire, and that they might extend themselves whither they\r\nwished in the provinces. Sapor granted him all he asked.\r\n\r\nMani had already preached in India, China, and among the inhabitants of\r\nTurkestan, and in every land he left behind him disciples.(87)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Teaching of Mani.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following extract from the same work gives but the beginning\r\n    of an extended statement of Mani’s teaching. But it is hoped that\r\n    enough is given to show the mythological character of his\r\n    speculation. The bulk of his doctrine was Persian and late\r\n    Babylonian, and the Christian element was very slight. It is clear\r\n    from the writings of St. Augustine that the doctrine changed much\r\n    in later years in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of Mani, especially his dogmas of the Eternal, to whom be\r\npraise and glory, of the creation of the world and the contest between\r\nLight and Darkness: Mani put at the beginning of the world two eternal\r\nprinciples. Of these one is Light, the other Darkness. They are separated\r\nfrom each other. As to the Light, this is the First, the Mighty One, and\r\nthe Infinite. He is the Deity, the King of the Paradise of Light. He has\r\nfive members or attributes, namely, gentleness, wisdom, understanding,\r\ndiscretion, and insight; and further five members or attributes, namely,\r\nlove, faith, truth, bravery, and wisdom. He asserts that God was from all\r\neternity with these attributes. Together with the Light-God there are two\r\nother things from eternity, the air and the earth.\r\n\r\nMani teaches further: The members of the air, or the Light-Ether, are\r\nfive: gentleness, wisdom, understanding, discretion, and insight. The\r\nmembers of the Light-Earth are the soft gentle breath, the wind, the\r\nlight, the water, and the fire. As to the other Original Being, the\r\nDarkness, its members are also five: the vapor, the burning heat, the\r\nfiery wind, the poison, and the darkness.\r\n\r\nThis bright shining Primal Being was in immediate proximity with the dark\r\nPrimal Being, so that no wall of partition was between them and the Light\r\ntouched the Darkness on its broad side. The Light is unlimited in its\r\nheight, and also to the right hand and to the left; the Darkness, however,\r\nis unlimited in its depth, and also to the right hand and to the left.\r\n\r\nFrom this Dark-Earth rose Satan, not so that he himself was without\r\nbeginning, although his parts were in their elements without beginning.\r\nThese parts joined themselves together from the elements and formed\r\nthemselves into Satan. His head was like that of a lion, his trunk like\r\nthat of a dragon, his wings as those of a bird, his tail like that of a\r\ngreat fish, and his four feet like the feet of creeping things. When this\r\nSatan had been formed from the Darkness—his name is the First Devil—then\r\nhe began to devour and to swallow up and to ruin, to move about to the\r\nright and to the left, and to get down into the deep, so that he\r\ncontinually brought ruin and destruction to every one who attempted to\r\novermaster him. Next he hastened up on high and perceived the rays of\r\nlight, but felt an aversion to them. Then when he saw how these rays by\r\nreciprocal influence and contact were increased in brilliancy, he became\r\nafraid and crept together into himself, member by member, and withdrew for\r\nunion and strengthening back to his original constituent parts. Now once\r\nmore he hastened back into the height, and the Light-Earth noticed the\r\naction of Satan and his purpose to seize and to attack and to destroy. But\r\nwhen she perceived this thereupon the world æon of Insight perceived it,\r\nthen the æon of Wisdom, the æon of Discretion, the æon of the\r\nUnderstanding, and then the æon of Gentleness. Thereupon the King of the\r\nParadise of Light perceived it and reflected on means to gain the mastery\r\nover him. His armies were indeed mighty enough to overcome him; he had the\r\nwish, however, to accomplish this himself. Therefore he begat with the\r\nspirit of his right hand, with the five æons, and with his twelve elements\r\na creature, and that was the Primal Man, and him he sent to the conquest\r\nof Darkness.(88)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. The Last Great Persecution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last of the persecutions was closely connected with the increased\r\nefficiency of the imperial administration after a period of anarchy, and\r\nwas more effective because of the greater centralization of the government\r\nwhich Diocletian had introduced (§ 55). It was preceded by a number of\r\nminor persecuting regulations, but broke forth in its full fury in 303,\r\nraging for nearly ten years (§ 56). It was by far the most severe of all\r\npersecutions, in extent and duration and severity surpassing that of\r\nDecius and Valerian. As in that persecution, very many suffered severely,\r\nstill more lapsed, unprepared for suffering, as many were in the previous\r\npersecution, and the Church was again rent with dissensions and schisms\r\narising over the question of the administration of discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 55. The Reorganization of the Empire by Diocletian\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a period of anarchy Diocletian (284-305) undertook a reorganization\r\nof the Empire for the sake of greater efficiency. Following a precedent of\r\nearlier successful emperors, he shared (285) the imperial authority with a\r\ncolleague, Maximianus, who in 286 became Augustus of the West. As the\r\ngreatest danger seemed to lie in the East, Diocletian retained the Eastern\r\npart of the Empire, and having already abandoned Rome as the imperial\r\nresidence (284), he settled in Nicomedia in Bithynia. To provide for a\r\nsuccession to the throne more efficient than the chance succession of\r\nnatural heirs, two Cæsars were appointed in 293, Constantius Chlorus for\r\nthe West, and Galerius, the son-in-law of Diocletian, for the East.\r\nConstantius at once became the son-in-law of Maximianus. These Cæsars were\r\nto ascend the throne when the _Augusti_ resigned after twenty years’\r\nreign. The scheme worked temporarily for greater efficiency, but ended in\r\ncivil war as the claims of natural heirs were set aside in favor of an\r\nartificial dynasty. At the same time the system bore heavily upon the\r\npeople and the prosperity of the Empire rapidly declined.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bibliography in _Cambridge Medieval History_, London and New York,\r\n    1911, vol. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nLactantius, _De Mortibus Persecutorum_, 7. (MSL, 7:204.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Diocletian, the author of crimes and deviser of evils, was ruining\r\nall things, not even from against God could he withhold his hand. This\r\nman, partly by avarice and partly by timidity, overturned the world. For\r\nhe made three persons sharers with him in the government. The Empire was\r\ndivided into four parts, and armies were multiplied, since each of the\r\nfour princes strove to have a much larger military force than any emperor\r\nhad had when one emperor alone carried on the government. There began to\r\nbe a greater number of those who received taxes than of those who paid\r\nthem; so that the means of the husbandmen were exhausted by enormous\r\nimpositions, the fields were abandoned, and cultivated grounds became\r\nwoodlands, and universal dismay prevailed. Besides, the provinces were\r\ndivided into minute portions and many presidents and prefects lay heavy on\r\neach territory, and almost on every city. There were many stewards and\r\nmasters and deputy presidents, before whom very few civil causes came, but\r\nonly condemnations and frequent forfeitures, and exactions of numberless\r\ncommodities, and I will not say often repeated, but perpetual and\r\nintolerable, wrongs in the exacting of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 56. The Diocletian Persecution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last great persecution was preceded by a number of laws aimed to annoy\r\nthe Christians. On March 12, 295, all soldiers in the army were ordered to\r\noffer sacrifice. In 296 sacred books of the Christians were sought for and\r\nburnt at Alexandria. In 297 or 298 Christian persecutions began in the\r\narmy, but the great persecution itself broke out in 303, as described\r\nbelow. Among other reasons for energetic measures in which Galerius took\r\nthe lead, appears to have been that prince’s desire to establish the unity\r\nof the Empire upon a religious basis, which is borne out by his attempts\r\nto reorganize the heathen worship immediately after the cessation of the\r\npersecution. In April, 311, the edict of Galerius, known as the Edict of\r\nthe Three Emperors, put an official end to the persecution. In parts of\r\nthe Empire, however, small persecutions took place and the authorities\r\nattempted to attack Christianity without actually carrying on\r\npersecutions, as in the wide-spread dissemination of the infamous “Acts of\r\nPilate,” which were posted on walls and spread through the schools. In the\r\nterritories of Constantius Chlorus the persecution had been very light,\r\nand there was none under Constantine who favored Christians from the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VIII, and IX,\r\n    9; his little work _On the Martyrs of Palestine_ will be found\r\n    after the eighth book. Lactantius, _De Mortibus Persecutorum_.

Knopf, _Ausgewählte Märtyreracten_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Lactantius. _De Mortibus Persecutorum_, 12 _ff_. (MSL. 7:213.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The outbreak of the persecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fit and auspicious day was sought for the accomplishment of this\r\nundertaking [_i.e._, the persecution of the Christians]; and the festival\r\nof the great god Terminus, celebrated on the seventh calends of March\r\n[Feb. 23], was chosen, to put an end, as it were, to this religion,\r\n\r\n“That day the first of death, was first of evil’s cause” (Vergil),\r\n\r\nand cause of evils which befell not only the Christians but the whole\r\nworld. When that day dawned, in the eighth consulship of Diocletian and\r\nseventh of Maximianus, suddenly, while it was hardly light, the prefect,\r\ntogether with the chief commanders, tribunes, and officers of the\r\ntreasury, came to the church [in Nicomedia], and when the gates had been\r\nforced open they sought for an image of God. The books of the Holy\r\nScriptures were found and burnt; the spoil was given to all. Rapine,\r\nconfusion, and tumult reigned. Since the church was situated on rising\r\nground, and was visible from the palace, Diocletian and Galerius stood\r\nthere as if on a watch-tower and disputed long together whether it ought\r\nto be set on fire. The opinion of Diocletian prevailed, for he feared\r\nlest, when so great a fire should once be started, the city might be\r\nburnt; for many and large buildings surrounded the church on all sides.\r\nThen the prætorian guard, in battle array, came with axes and other iron\r\ninstruments, and having been let loose everywhere, in a few hours they\r\nlevelled that very lofty building to the ground.\r\n\r\nCh. 13. Next day the edict was published ordaining that men of the\r\nChristian religion should be deprived of all honors and dignities; and\r\nalso that they should be subjected to torture, of whatsoever rank or\r\nposition they might be; and that every suit of law should be entertained\r\nagainst them; but they, on the other hand, could not bring any suit for\r\nany wrong, adultery, or theft; and finally, that they should have neither\r\nfreedom nor the right of suffrage. A certain person, although not\r\nproperly, yet with a brave soul, tore down this edict and cut it up,\r\nsaying in derision: “These are the triumphs of Goths and Samaritans.”\r\nHaving been brought to judgment, he was not only tortured, but was burnt\r\nin the legal manner, and with admirable patience he was consumed to ashes.\r\n\r\nCh. 14. But Galerius was not satisfied with the terms of the edict, and\r\nsought another way to gain over the Emperor. That he might urge him to\r\nexcess of cruelty in persecution, he employed private agents to set the\r\npalace on fire; and when some part of it had been burnt the Christians\r\nwere accused as public enemies, and the very appellation of Christian grew\r\nodious on account of its connection with the fire in the palace. It was\r\nsaid that the Christians, in concert with the eunuchs, had plotted to\r\ndestroy the princes, and that both the emperors had well-nigh been burnt\r\nalive in their own palace. Diocletian, who always wanted to appear shrewd\r\nand intelligent, suspecting nothing of the deception, but inflamed with\r\nanger, began immediately to torture all his domestics.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VIII, 2; 6: 8. (MSG, 20:753.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The edicts of Diocletian.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first passage occurs, with slight variations, in the\r\n    introduction to the work _On the Martyrs of Palestine._\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 2. It was in the nineteenth year of the reign of Diocletian, in the\r\nmonth Dystus, called March by the Romans, when the feast of the Saviour’s\r\npassion was near at hand, that royal edicts were published everywhere\r\ncommanding that the churches be levelled to the ground, the Scriptures be\r\ndestroyed by fire, and all holding places of honor be branded with infamy,\r\nand that the household servants, if they persisted in the profession of\r\nChristianity, be deprived of their freedom.\r\n\r\nSuch was the original edict against us. But not long after other decrees\r\nwere issued, commanding that all the rulers of the churches everywhere\r\nshould be first thrown into prison, and afterward compelled by every means\r\nto sacrifice.\r\n\r\nCh. 6:8. Such things occurred in Nicomedia at the beginning of the\r\npersecution. But not long after, as persons in the country called Melitina\r\nand others throughout Syria attempted to usurp the government, a royal\r\nedict commanded that the rulers of the churches everywhere be thrown into\r\nprison and bonds. What was to be seen after this exceeds all description.\r\nA vast multitude were imprisoned in every place; and the prisons\r\neverywhere, which had long before been prepared for murderers and\r\ngrave-robbers, were filled with bishops, presbyters and deacons, readers\r\nand exorcists, so that room was no longer left in them for those condemned\r\nfor crimes. And as other decrees followed the first, directing that those\r\nin prison, if they sacrificed, should be permitted to depart from the\r\nprison in freedom, but that those who refused should be harassed with many\r\ntortures, how could any one again number the multitude of martyrs in every\r\nprovince, and especially those in Africa and Mauretania, and Thebais and\r\nEgypt?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Edict of Galerius, A.D. 311. Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, VIII. 17. (MSG,\r\n20:792.) _Cf._ Preuschen, _Analecta_, I, § 21:5.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This may also be found in Lactantius. _De Mortibus Persecutorum_,\r\n    ch. 34. It is known as the “Edict of Three Emperors,” as it was\r\n    issued from Nicomedia in the name of Galerius, Constantine, and\r\n    Licinius. The date is April 30, 311. By it the persecution was not\r\n    wholly ended. Galerius died in the next month, but Maximinus Daza\r\n    resumed the persecution. There was for six months, however, some\r\n    mitigation of the persecutions in the East, granted at the request\r\n    of Constantine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst our other measures, which we are always making for the use and\r\nprofit of the commonwealth, we have hitherto endeavored to bring all\r\nthings into conformity with the ancient laws and public order of the\r\nRomans, and to bring it about also that the Christians, who have abandoned\r\nthe religion of their ancestors, should return to sound reason. For in\r\nsome way such wilfulness has seized the Christians and such folly\r\npossessed them that they do not follow those constitutions of the\r\nancients, which peradventure their own ancestors first established, but\r\nentirely according to their own judgment and as it pleased them they were\r\nmaking such laws for themselves as they would observe, and in different\r\nplaces were assembling various sorts of people. In short, when our command\r\nwas issued that they were to betake themselves to the institutions of the\r\nancients, many of them were subdued by danger, many also were ruined. Yet\r\nwhen great numbers of them held to their determination, and we saw that\r\nthey neither gave worship and due reverence to the gods nor yet regarded\r\nthe God of the Christians, we therefore, mindful of our most mild clemency\r\nand of the unbroken custom whereby we are accustomed to grant pardon to\r\nall men, have thought that in this case also speediest indulgence ought to\r\nbe granted to them, that the Christians might exist again and might\r\nestablish their gatherings, yet so that they do nothing contrary to good\r\norder. By another letter we shall signify to magistrates how they are to\r\nproceed. Wherefore, in accordance with this our indulgence, they ought to\r\npray their God for our good estate, for that of the commonwealth, and for\r\ntheir own, that the commonwealth may endure on every side unharmed and\r\nthat they may be able to live securely in their own homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Constantine, _Edict of Milan_, A. D. 313, in Lactantius, _De\r\nMortibus Persecutorum_, 48. (MSL, 7:267.) See also Eusebius. _Hist. Ec._,\r\nX, 5:2. (MSG, 20:880.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The so-called Edict of Milan, granting toleration to the\r\n    Christians, is not the actual edict, but a letter addressed to a\r\n    prefect and referring to the edict, which probably was much\r\n    briefer. The following passage is translated from the emended text\r\n    of Lactantius, as given in Preuschen, _op. cit._, I, § 22:4.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I, Constantine Augustus, and I, Licinius Augustus, had happily met\r\ntogether at Milan, and were having under consideration all things which\r\nconcern the advantage and security of the State, we thought that, among\r\nother things which seemed likely to profit men generally, we ought, in the\r\nvery first place, to set in order the conditions of the reverence paid to\r\nthe Divinity by giving to the Christians and all others full permission to\r\nfollow whatever worship any man had chosen; whereby whatever divinity\r\nthere is in heaven may be benevolent and propitious to us, and to all\r\nplaced under our authority. Therefore we thought we ought, with sound\r\ncounsel and very right reason, to lay down this law, that we should in no\r\nway refuse to any man any legal right who has given up his mind either to\r\nthe observance of Christianity or to that worship which he personally\r\nfeels best suited to himself; to the end that the Supreme Divinity, whose\r\nworship we freely follow, may continue in all things to grant us his\r\naccustomed favor and good-will. Wherefore your devotion should know that\r\nit is our pleasure that all provisions whatsoever which have appeared in\r\ndocuments hitherto directed to your office regarding Christians and which\r\nappeared utterly improper and opposed to our clemency should be abolished,\r\nand that every one of those men who have the same wish to observe\r\nChristian worship may now freely and unconditionally endeavor to observe\r\nthe same without any annoyance or molestation. These things we thought it\r\nwell to signify in the fullest manner to your carefulness, that you might\r\nknow that we have given free and absolute permission to the said\r\nChristians to practise their worship. And when you perceive that we have\r\ngranted this to the said Christians, your devotion understands that to\r\nothers also a similarly full and free permission for their own worship and\r\nobservance is granted, for the quiet of our times, so that every man may\r\nhave freedom in the practice of whatever worship he has chosen. And these\r\nthings were done by us that nothing be taken away from any honor or form\r\nof worship. Moreover, in regard to the Christians, we have thought fit to\r\nordain this also, that if any appear to have bought, either from our\r\nexchequer or from others, the places in which they were accustomed\r\nformerly to assemble, and concerning which definite orders have been given\r\nbefore now, and that by letters sent to your office, the same be restored\r\nto the Christians, setting aside all delay and dispute, without payment or\r\ndemand of price. Those also who have obtained them by gift shall restore\r\nthem in like manner without delay to the said Christians; and those,\r\nmoreover, who have bought them, as well as those who have obtained them by\r\ngift, if they request anything of our benevolence, they shall apply to the\r\ndeputy that order may be taken for them too by our clemency. All these\r\nmust be delivered over at once and without delay by your intervention to\r\nthe corporation of the Christians. And since the same Christians are known\r\nto have possessed not only the places where they are accustomed to\r\nassemble, but also others belonging to their corporation, namely, to the\r\nchurches and not to individuals, all these by the law which we have\r\ndescribed above you will order to be restored without any doubtfulness or\r\ndispute to the said Christians—that is, to their said corporations and\r\nassemblies; provided always, as aforesaid, that those who restore them\r\nwithout price, as we said, shall expect a compensation from our\r\nbenevolence. In all these things you must give the aforesaid Christians\r\nyour most effective intervention, that our command may be fulfilled as\r\nsoon as may be, and that in this matter also order may be taken by our\r\nclemency for the public quiet. And may it be, as already said, that the\r\ndivine favor which we have already experienced in so many affairs, shall\r\ncontinue for all time to give us prosperity and successes, together with\r\nhappiness for the State. But that it may be possible for the nature of\r\nthis decree and of our benevolence to come to the knowledge of all men, it\r\nwill be your duty by a proclamation of your own to publish everywhere and\r\nbring to the notice of all men this present document when it reaches you,\r\nthat the decree of this our benevolence may not be hidden.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 57. Rise of Schisms in Consequence of the Diocletian Persecution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diocletian persecution and its various continuations, on account of\r\nthe severity of the persecution and its great extent, seriously strained\r\nthe organization of the Church for a time, and in at least three important\r\nChurch centres gave rise to schisms, of which two were of some duration.\r\nThe causes for these schisms, as in the case of the schisms connected with\r\nthe Decian persecution, are to be found in the confusion caused by the\r\nenforced absence of bishops from their sees and in the administration of\r\ndiscipline. In the latter point the activity of the confessors no longer\r\nplays any part, as the authority of the bishops in the various communities\r\nis now undisputed by rival. It was a question of greater or less rigor in\r\nreadmitting the lapsed to the communion of the Church. For the canons of\r\ndiscipline in force in Alexandria, see the _Canonical Epistle of Peter of\r\nAlexandria_, ANF, VI, 269 _ff._ (MSG, 18:467.) They were regarded by the\r\nrigorist party in Alexandria as too lax. Of the three schisms known to\r\nhave arisen from the Diocletian persecution, that in Alexandria is known\r\nas the Meletian schism, and three selections are given bearing on it. For\r\nthe proposals of the Council of Nicæa to bring about a settlement and\r\nunion, see the _Epistle of the Synod of Nicæa_, Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, I,\r\n9 (given below, § 61, _II_, _b_). The schism continued until the fifth\r\ncentury. The schism at Rome, known as the schism of Heraclius, was much\r\nless important. It was caused by the party advocating greater laxity in\r\ndiscipline, and was for a time difficult to deal with on account of long\r\nvacancies in the Roman episcopate. The duration of the schism could not\r\nhave been long, but the solution of the questions raised by it is unknown.\r\nIn fact, the history of the Roman church is exceedingly obscure in the\r\nhalf-century preceding the Council of Nicæa. The third schism, that of the\r\nDonatists in North Africa, which broke out in Carthage, was the most\r\nconsiderable in the Church before the schisms arising from the\r\nchristological controversies. For the Donatist schism, see §§ 61, 67, 72.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Epistle of Hesychius, Pachomius, Theodorus, and Phileas to\r\nMeletius_. (MSG, 10:1565.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Meletian schism.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following epistle was written in the name of these four\r\n    bishops, probably by Phileas, bishop of Thmuis, one of the number,\r\n    to Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis. The four were in prison when it\r\n    was written. It is the most important document bearing on the\r\n    schism, and is important as setting forth the generally accepted\r\n    legal opinion of the time regarding ordination and the authority\r\n    of bishops. The document exists only in a Latin translation from a\r\n    Greek original, and appears to form, with the two following\r\n    fragments, a continuous narrative, possibly a history of the\r\n    Church, but nothing further is known of it. For an account of the\r\n    Meletian schism see Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, 1, 6 _ff._ The text of\r\n    these selections bearing on the Meletian schism is to be found in\r\n    Routh, _op. cit._, IV, 91 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\nHesychius, Pachomius, Theodorus, and Phileas to Meletius, our friend and\r\nfellow-minister in the Lord, greeting. In simple faith, regarding as\r\nuncertain the things which have been heard concerning thee, since some\r\nhave come to us and certain things are reported foreign to divine order\r\nand ecclesiastical rule which are being attempted, yea, rather, which are\r\nbeing done by thee, we were not willing to credit them when we thought of\r\nthe audacity implied by their magnitude, and we thought that they were\r\nuncertain attempts. But since so many coming to us at the present time\r\nhave lent some credibility to these reports, and have not hesitated to\r\nattest them as facts, we, greatly astonished, have been compelled to write\r\nthis letter to thee. And what agitation and sadness have been caused to us\r\nall in common and to each of us individually by the ordination performed\r\nby thee in parishes not pertaining to thee, we are unable sufficiently to\r\nexpress. We have not delayed, however, by a short statement, to prove thy\r\npractice wrong.\r\n\r\nIn the law of our fathers and forefathers, of which thou also art not\r\nthyself ignorant, it is established, according to the divine and\r\necclesiastical order (for it is all for the good pleasure of God and the\r\nzealous regard for better things), that it has been determined and settled\r\nby them that it is not lawful for any bishop to perform ordinations in\r\nother parishes than his own. This law is exceedingly important and wisely\r\ndevised. For, in the first place, it is but right that the conversation\r\nand life of those who are ordained should be examined with great care;\r\nand, in the second place, that all confusion and turbulence should be done\r\naway with. For every one shall have enough to do in managing his own\r\nparish, and in finding, with great care and many anxieties, suitable\r\nsubordinates among those with whom he has passed his whole life, and who\r\nhave been trained under his hands. But thou, considering none of these\r\nthings, nor regarding the future, nor considering the law of our holy\r\nFathers and those who have put on Christ in long succession, nor the honor\r\nof our great bishop and father, Peter,(89) on whom we all depend in the\r\nhope which we have in the Lord Jesus Christ, nor softened by our\r\nimprisonments and trials, and daily and multiplied reproaches, nor the\r\noppressions and distress of all, hast ventured on subverting all things at\r\nonce. And what means will be left for thee for justifying thyself with\r\nrespect to these things?\r\n\r\nBut perhaps thou wilt say, I did this to prevent many from being drawn\r\naway with the unbelief of many, because the flocks were in need and\r\nforsaken, there being no pastor with them. Well, but it is most certain\r\nthat they were in no such destitution; in the first place, because there\r\nwere many going among them and able to visit them; and, in the second\r\nplace, even it there were some things neglected by them, representation\r\nshould have come from the people, and we should have duly considered the\r\nmatter. But they knew that they were in no want of ministers, and\r\ntherefore they did not come to seek thee. They knew that either we were\r\nwont to warn them from such complaint or there was done, with all\r\ncarefulness, what seemed profitable; for it was done under correction and\r\nall was considered with well-approved honesty. Thou, however, giving such\r\ncareful attention to the deceits of certain men and their vain words,(90)\r\nhast, as it were, stealthily leaped forward to the performance of\r\nordinations. For if, indeed, those accompanying thee constrained thee to\r\nthis and compelled thee and were ignorant of the ecclesiastical order,\r\nthou oughtest to have followed the rule and have informed us by letter;\r\nand in that way what seemed expedient would have been done. And if\r\nperchance some persuaded thee to credit their story, who said to thee that\r\nit was all over with us—a matter which could not have been unknown to\r\nthee, because there were many passing and repassing by us who might visit\r\nthee—even if this had been so, yet oughtest thou to have waited for the\r\njudgment of the superior father and his allowance of this thing. But\r\nthinking nothing of these matters, and hoping something different, or\r\nrather having no care for us, thou hast provided certain rulers for the\r\npeople. For now we learn that there are also divisions, because thy\r\nunwarrantable ordination displeased many.\r\n\r\nAnd thou wert not readily persuaded to delay such procedure or restrain\r\nthy purpose, no, not even by the word of the Apostle Paul, the most\r\nblessed seer and the man who put on Christ, the Apostle of us all; for he,\r\nin writing to his dearly loved Timothy, says: “Lay hands suddenly on no\r\nman, neither be partaker of other men’s sins.” [I Tim. 5:22.] And thus he\r\nat once shows his own consideration of him, and gives his example and\r\nexhibits the law according to which, with all carefulness and caution,\r\ncandidates are chosen for the honor of ordination. We make this\r\ndeclaration to thee, that in the future thou mayest study to keep within\r\nthe safe and salutary limits of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Fragment on the Meletian Schism_. (MSG, 10:1567.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the connection of the Meletians with Arianism, see Socrates,\r\n    _Hist. Ec._, I, 6. Text in Routh, _op. cit._, IV, 94.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeletius received and read this epistle, and he neither wrote a reply, nor\r\nrepaired to them in prison, nor went to the blessed Peter [bishop of\r\nAlexandria]. But when all these bishops, presbyters, and deacons had\r\nsuffered in the prison,(91) he at once entered Alexandria. Now in that\r\ncity there was a certain person, Isidorus by name, turbulent in character,\r\nand possessed with the ambition of being a teacher. And there was also a\r\ncertain Arius, who wore the habit of piety and was in like manner\r\npossessed with the ambition of being a teacher. And when they discovered\r\nthe object of Meletius’s passion and what it was he sought, hastening to\r\nhim and regarding with malice the episcopal authority of the blessed\r\nPeter, that the aim and desire of Meletius might be made manifest, they\r\ndiscovered to Meletius certain presbyters, then in hiding, to whom the\r\nblessed Peter had given authority to act as diocesan visitors for\r\nAlexandria. And Meletius, recommending them to improve the opportunity\r\ngiven them for rectifying their error, suspended them for a time, and by\r\nhis authority ordained two persons in their places, one of whom was in\r\nprison and the other in the mines. On learning these things, the blessed\r\nPeter, with much endurance, wrote to the people of Alexandria in the\r\nfollowing terms. [See next selection.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Peter of Alexandria. _Epistle to the Church in Alexandria._ (MSG,\r\n18:510.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    For Peter of Alexandria, see DCB. Peter was in hiding when he\r\n    wrote the following to the Alexandrian church in 306. He died 312\r\n    as a martyr.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter to the brethren in the Lord, beloved and established in the faith of\r\nGod, peace. Since I have discovered that Meletius acts in no way for the\r\ncommon good, for he does not approve the letter of the most holy bishops\r\nand martyrs, and invading my parish, has assumed so much to himself as to\r\nendeavor to separate from my authority the priests and those who had been\r\nintrusted with visiting the needy, and, giving proof of his desire for\r\npre-eminence, has ordained in the prison several unto himself; now take ye\r\nheed to this and hold no communion with him, until I meet him in company\r\nwith some wise men, and see what designs they are which he has thought\r\nupon. Fare ye well.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Epitaph of Eusebius, Bishop of Rome._ _Cf._ Kirch, n. 534.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Schism of Heraclius.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following epitaph was placed on the tomb of Eusebius, bishop of Rome\r\n(April 18 to August 17, 310 A. D.), by Damasus, bishop of Rome (366-384.)\r\n\r\nI, Damasus, have made this:\r\nHeraclius forbade the fallen to lament their sin,\r\nEusebius taught the wretched ones to weep for their crimes.\r\nThe people was divided into parties by the increasing madness.\r\nSedition, bloodshed, war, discord, strife arose.\r\nAt once they were equally smitten by the ferocity of the tyrant.(92)\r\nAlthough the guide of the Church(93) maintained intact the bonds of peace.\r\nHe endured exile joyful under the Lord as judge,\r\nAnd gave up this earthly life on the Trinacrian shore.(94)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND DIVISION OF ANCIENT CHRISTIANITY: THE CHURCH UNDER THE\r\nCHRISTIAN EMPIRE: FROM 312 TO CIRCA 750\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second division of the history of ancient Christianity, or\r\nChristianity under the influence of the Græco-Roman type of culture,\r\nbegins with the sole rule of Constantine, A. D. 324, or his sole reign in\r\nthe West, A. D. 312, and extends to the beginning of the Middle Ages, or\r\nthat period in which the Germanic nations assumed the leading rôle in the\r\npolitical life of western Europe. The end of this division of Church\r\nhistory may be placed, at the latest, about the middle of the eighth\r\ncentury, as the time when the authority of the Eastern Empire ceased to\r\naffect materially the fortunes of the West. But it is impossible to name\r\nany year or reign or political event as of such outstanding importance as\r\nto make it a _terminus ad quem_ for the division which will command the\r\nsuffrages of all as the boundary between the ancient and the mediæval\r\nepochs of history.\r\n\r\nThe second division of ancient Christianity may be subdivided into three\r\nperiods:\r\n\r\nI. The Imperial State Church of the Undivided Empire, or until the Death\r\nof Theodosius the Great, or to 395.\r\n\r\nII. The Church in the Divided Empire until the Collapse of the Western\r\nEmpire and the Schism between the East and the West arising out of the\r\nMonophysite Controversies, or to circa 500.\r\n\r\nIII. The Dissolution of the Imperial Church of the West and the Transition\r\nto the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nIn the third period are to be placed the beginnings of the Middle Ages, as\r\nthe German invaders had long before 500 established their kingdoms and had\r\nbegun to dominate the affairs of the West. But the connection of the\r\nChurch of the West, or rather of Italy, with the East was long so close\r\nthat the condition of the Church is more that of a dissolution of the\r\nancient imperial State Church than of a building up of the mediæval\r\nChurch. At the same time, the transition to the Middle Ages, so far as the\r\nChurch is concerned at least, takes place under the influence of the\r\nancient tradition, and institutions are established in which the leading\r\nelements, taken from ancient life, are not yet transformed by Germanic\r\nideas. The East knew no Middle Age. For a history of the Eastern Church\r\nother divisions would have to be made, but in a history in which, for\r\npractical reasons, the development is traced in Western Christianity, the\r\naffairs of the Eastern Church must be treated as subordinate to those of\r\nWestern Christianity.\r\n\r\nFor the second division of the history of ancient Christianity, the\r\nprincipal sources available in English are the translations in _A Select\r\nLibrary of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church_.\r\nEdited by Ph. Schaff and H. Wace. The _First Series_ of this collection\r\n(PNF, ser. I) contains the principal works of Augustine and Chrysostom.\r\nThe _Second Series_ (PNF, ser. II) is for historical study even more\r\nvaluable, and gives, generally with very able introductions and excellent\r\nbibliographies, the most important works of many of the leading patristic\r\nwriters, including the principal ecclesiastical historians, as well as\r\nAthanasius, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, Basil the Great, Cyril\r\nof Jerusalem, Hilary of Poitiers, Jerome, Rufinus, Cassian, Vincent of\r\nLérins, Leo the Great, Gregory the Great, and others. These translations\r\nare in part fresh versions, and in part older versions but slightly, if at\r\nall, revised, taken from the _Library of the Fathers of the Holy Catholic\r\nChurch anterior to the Division of the East and West_, Oxford, 1838, _et\r\nseq._\r\n\r\nFor the period before the outbreak of the great christological\r\ncontroversies, the ecclesiastical historians are of great value. There are\r\nno less than four continuations of the _Ecclesiastical History_ of\r\nEusebius accessible: the ecclesiastical histories of Socrates, 324-439\r\n(ed. R. Hussey, Oxford, 1853); of Sozomen, 324-425 (ed. R. Hussey, Oxford,\r\n1860); of Rufinus, 324-395, which is appended to a Latin version or rather\r\nrevised and “edited” Latin version of Eusebius; of Theodoret, 323-428 (ed.\r\nGaisford, Oxford, 1854). Fragments of the _Ecclesiastical History_ of the\r\nArian Philostorgius, from the appearance of Arius as a teacher until 423,\r\nhave been translated and are to be found in Bohn’s _Ecclesiastical\r\nLibrary_. For the period after the Council of Ephesus, A. D. 431, there is\r\nno such abundance, but Evagrius, of whose history (ed. Parmentier and\r\nBidez, London, 1898) there is a translation in Bohn’s _Ecclesiastical\r\nLibrary_, though not in PNF, is of great value as he gives many original\r\ndocuments; and a portion of the _Ecclesiastical History_ of John of\r\nEphesus (trans. by R. P. Smith, Oxford, 1860) carries the history to about\r\n600. There are also works devoted to the history of the West by Gregory of\r\nTours, the Venerable Bede, and Paulus Diaconus, and others of the greatest\r\nvalue for the third period of this division. They will be mentioned in\r\ntheir place.\r\n\r\nAs the series of the great church councils begins with the Christian\r\nEmpire, the _History of the Councils_, by Hefele, becomes indispensable to\r\nthe student of ecclesiastical history, not only for its narrative but for\r\nthe sources epitomized or given in full. It has been translated into\r\nEnglish as far as the close of the eighth century, or well into the\r\nbeginnings of the history of the mediæval Church. The new French\r\ntranslation should be used if possible as it contains valuable additional\r\nnotes. In connection with Hefele may be used:\r\n\r\nPercival, _The Seven Ecumenical Councils_, in PNF, ser. II, vol. XIV.\r\n\r\nWm. Bright, _Notes on the Canons of the First Four General __ Councils_,\r\n1882, should be consulted for this period. Bruns, _op. cit._, and\r\nLauchert, _op. cit._, give texts only.\r\n\r\nThe two great collections of secular laws are:\r\n\r\n_Codex Theodosianus_, ed. Mommsen and Meyer, Berlin, 1905.\r\n\r\n_Corpus Juris Civilis_, ed. Krüger, Mommsen, Schoell, and Knoll, Berlin,\r\n1899-1902.\r\n\r\n_The Cambridge Medieval History_, vol. I, 1912, covers the period\r\nbeginning with Constantine and extending to the beginning of the fifth\r\ncentury. It contains valuable bibliographies of a more discriminating\r\ncharacter than those in the _Cambridge Modern History_, and render\r\nbibliographical references unnecessary. To this the student is accordingly\r\nreferred for such matters. The second volume of this work will cover the\r\nperiod 500-850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriod I: The Imperial State Church Of The Undivided Empire, Or Until The\r\nDeath Of Theodosius The Great, 395\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Church in the first period of the second division of\r\nthe history of ancient Christianity has to deal primarily with three lines\r\nof development, viz.: first, the relation of the Church to the imperial\r\nauthority and the religious forces of the times, whereby the Church became\r\nestablished as the sole authorized religion of the Empire, and heathenism\r\nand heresy were prohibited by law; secondly, the development of the\r\ndoctrinal system of the Church until the end of the Arian controversy,\r\nwhereby the full and eternal deity of the Son was established as the\r\nCatholic faith; thirdly, the development of the constitution, the fixation\r\nof the leading ecclesiastical conceptions, and the adaptation of the\r\nsystem of the Church to the practical needs of the times. The entire\r\nperiod may be divided into two main parts by the reign of Julian the\r\nApostate (361-363); and the reign of Constantine as Emperor of the West\r\n(312-324) may be regarded as a prelude to the main part of the history. On\r\nthe death of Theodosius the Great in 395, the Empire became permanently\r\ndivided, and though in the second period the courses of the Church in the\r\nEast and in the West may be treated to some extent together, yet the\r\nfortunes, interests, and problems of the two divisions of the Church begin\r\nto diverge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. The Church And Empire Under Constantine\r\n\r\n\r\nConstantine was the heir to the political system of Diocletian. The same\r\nline of development was followed by him and his sons, and with increasing\r\nseverity the burden pressed upon the people. But the Church, which had\r\nbeen fiercely persecuted by Diocletian and Galerius, became the object of\r\nimperial favor under Constantine. At the same time in many parts of the\r\nEmpire, especially in the West, the heathen religion was rooted in the\r\naffections of the people and everywhere it was bound up with the forms of\r\nstate. The new problems that confronted Constantine on his accession to\r\nsole authority in the West, and still more when he became sole Emperor,\r\nwere of an ecclesiastical rather than a civil character. In the\r\nadministration of the Empire he followed the lines laid down by Diocletian\r\n(§ 58). But in favoring the Church he had to avoid alienating the heathen\r\nmajority. This he did by gradually and cautiously extending to the Church\r\nprivileges which the heathen religion had enjoyed (§ 59), and with the\r\nutmost caution repressing those elements in heathenism which might be\r\nplausibly construed as inimical to the new order in the state (§ 60). At\r\nthe same time, Constantine found in the application of his policy to\r\nactual conditions that he could not favor every religious sect that\r\nassumed the name of Christian. He must distinguish between claimants of\r\nhis bounty. He must also bring about a unity in the Church where it had\r\nbeen threatened (§ 61), and repress what might lead to schism. Accordingly\r\nhe found himself, immediately after his accession to sole authority,\r\nengaged in ecclesiastical discussions and adjudicating by councils\r\necclesiastical cases (§ 62).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 58. The Empire under Constantine and His Sons\r\n\r\n\r\nConstantine became sole Emperor of the West, 312, and by the defeat of\r\nLicinius, July 23, 324, sole ruler of the entire Roman Empire. On his\r\ndeath, May 22, 337, his three sons divided between them the imperial\r\ndignity: Constantine II (337-340), taking Gaul, Spain, and Britain;\r\nConstans (337-350), Italy, Africa, and Illyria, and in 340 receiving the\r\nshare of Constantine II; Constantius (337-361), taking the East, including\r\nEgypt. Of these three the ablest was Constantius who, after the renewed\r\nPersian war (337-350), became, on the death of Constans, sole Emperor.\r\nAlthough the imperial authority was divided and the ecclesiastical policy\r\nof each Emperor followed the religious condition and theological\r\ncomplexion of his respective portion of the Empire, the social conditions\r\nwere everywhere much the same. There were under Constantine and also under\r\nhis sons the continuation of that centralization which had already been\r\ncarried far by Diocletian, the same court ceremonial and all that went\r\nwith it, and the development of the bureaucratic system of administration.\r\nThe economic conditions steadily declined as the imperial system became\r\nconstantly more burdensome (_v. supra_, § 55), and the changes in the\r\ndistribution of wealth and the administration of landed property affected\r\ndisastrously large sections of the populace. A characteristic feature of\r\nRoman society, which affected the position of the Church not a little, was\r\nthe tendency to regard callings and trades as hereditary, and by the\r\nfourth century this was enforced by law. The aim of this legislation was\r\nto provide workmen to care for the great public undertakings for the\r\nsupport of the populace of the cities and for the maintenance of the\r\npublic business. This policy affected both the humble artisan and the\r\ncitizen of curial rank. The former, although given various privileges, was\r\ncrushed down by being obliged to continue in what was often an\r\nunprofitable occupation; the latter was made responsible for the taxes and\r\nvarious public burdens which custom, gradually becoming law, laid upon\r\nhim. Constant attempt was made by great numbers to escape these burdens\r\nand disabilities by recourse to other occupations, and especially to the\r\nChristian ministry with its immunities (see § 59, _c_). Constant\r\nlegislation endeavored to prevent this and restore men to their hereditary\r\nplaces. The following extracts from the Theodosian Code are enactments of\r\nConstantine, and are intended to illustrate the condition, under that\r\nEmperor, of the law as to hereditary occupations and guilds, and the\r\nposition of the curiales, so as to explain the law as to admission to the\r\npriesthood.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XIII, 5, 1; A. D. 314.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Theodosian Code was a collection of law made at the command of\r\n    Theodosius II, A. D. 438. See § 80. It was intended to comprise\r\n    all the laws of general application made since the accession of\r\n    Constantine and arranged under appropriate titles.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a shipman shall have been originally a lighterman, none the less he\r\nshall remain permanently among those among whom it shall appear that his\r\nparents had been.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XIII, 5, 3; A. D. 319.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any shipman shall have obtained surreptitiously or in any other way\r\nimmunity, it is our will that he be not at all admitted to plead any\r\nexemption. But also if any one possess a patrimony liable to the duties of\r\na shipman, although he may be of higher dignity, the privileges of honor\r\nshall be of no avail to him in this matter, but let him be held to this\r\nduty either by the whole or in proportion. For it is not just that when a\r\npatrimony liable to this public duty has been excused all should not bear\r\nthe common burden in proportion to ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XIV, 4, 1; A. D. 334.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the guild of swineherds has fallen off to but few, we command that\r\nthey plead in the presence of the Roman people, for the defence should be\r\nmade to them for whom the burden was established.… Therefore let them know\r\nthat the personal property of the swineherds is liable to public burdens\r\nand let them choose one of two courses: either let them retain the\r\nproperty which is liable to the functions of swineherd, and let themselves\r\nbe held to the duty of swineherd, or let them name some suitable person\r\nwhom they will, who shall satisfy the same requirement. For we suffer no\r\none to be exempt from the obligation of this thing, but whether they have\r\nadvanced in honors, or by some fraud have escaped, we command that they be\r\nbrought back and the same thing performed, the Roman people being present\r\nand witnessing, and we are to be consulted, that we may take note of those\r\nwho make use of these shifts; as for further avoidance of public duties,\r\nit is by no means to be granted any, but he who shall have been able to\r\nescape shall run danger of his safety, the privilege having been taken\r\naway from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XII, 1, 11; A. D. 325.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following laws illustrate the attempts of the curiales to\r\n    escape their burdens.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause some have forsaken the curiæ and have fled to the camps of the\r\nsoldiery, we prescribe that all who shall be found not yet indebted to the\r\nchief centurion, are to be dismissed from the soldiery and returned to the\r\nsame curiæ; those only are to remain among the soldiery who are retained\r\non account of the necessities of the place or the troop.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XII, 1, 12; A. D. 325.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one belongs in a larger or smaller town and desiring to avoid the\r\nsame, betakes himself to another for the sake of dwelling there, and shall\r\nhave attempted to make petitions concerning this or shall have relied upon\r\nany sort of fraud that he may escape the birth from his own city, let him\r\nbear the burden of the decurionate of both cities, of one because it was\r\nhis choice, of the other because of his birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 2, 3, cf. XVI, 2, 6; A. D. 326.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince a constitution that has been issued prescribes that thereafter no\r\ndecurion nor child of a decurion or person with suitable wealth and able\r\nto support the public burdens shall have recourse to the name and duties\r\nof the clergy, but only those shall be called to the place of the deceased\r\nwho are of small fortune and are not held liable to civil burdens, we have\r\nlearned that some have been molested, who before the promulgation of the\r\nsaid law had joined themselves to the company of the priests. Therefore we\r\ndecree that these shall be free from all annoyance, but those who after\r\nthe promulgation of the law, to avoid their public duties took recourse to\r\nthe number of the clergy, shall be separated from that body and restored\r\nto their curial rank and made liable for their civil duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 59. Favor Shown the Church by Constantine\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither on his conversion nor on his attainment of the sole rule of the\r\nEmpire did Constantine establish the Church as the one official religion\r\nof the State. The ruler himself professed the Christian religion and\r\nneither abolished the former religion of the State nor disestablished it.\r\nBut he granted to his own religion favors similar to those enjoyed by the\r\nheathen religious systems (_a-d_), though these privileges were only for\r\nthe Catholic Church, and not for heretics (_e_); and he passed such laws\r\nas would make it possible for Christians to carry out their religious\r\npractices, _e.g._, that Christians should not be compelled to sacrifice\r\nwhen the laws prescribed sacrifices (_f_), that Sunday be observed (_g_),\r\nand that celibacy might be practised (_h_).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Eusebius, _Vita Constantini_ (PNF,\r\n    ser.

Since it is our\r\npleasure that something should be granted in all the provinces, namely,\r\nAfrica and Numidia and Mauritania, to certain ministers of the legitimate\r\nand most holy Catholic religion, to defray their expenses, I have given\r\nwritten instructions to Ursus, the illustrious finance minister of Africa,\r\nand have directed him to make provision to pay to thy firmness three\r\nthousand folles.(95) Do thou, therefore, when thou hast received the above\r\nsum of money, command that it be distributed among all those mentioned\r\nabove, according to the brief sent unto thee by Hosius. But if thou\r\nshouldest find that anything is wanting for the fulfilment of this my\r\npurpose in regard to all of them, thou shalt demand without hesitation\r\nfrom Heracleides, our treasurer, whatever thou findest to be necessary.\r\nFor I commanded him, when he was present, that if thy firmness should ask\r\nhim for any money, he should see to it that it be paid without any delay.\r\nAnd since I have learned that some men of unsettled mind wish to turn the\r\npeople from the most holy and Catholic Church by a certain method of\r\nshameful corruption, do thou know that I gave command to Anulinus, the\r\nproconsul, and also to Patricius, vicar of the prefects, when they were\r\npresent, that they should give proper attention not only to other matters,\r\nbut also, above all, to this, and that they should not overlook such a\r\nthing when it happened. Wherefore if thou shouldest see any such men\r\ncontinuing in this madness, do thou without delay go to the\r\nabove-mentioned judges and report the matter to them; that they may\r\ncorrect them as I commanded them when they were present. The divinity of\r\nthe great God preserve thee many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Constantine, _Ep. ad Anulinum_, in Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, X, 7.\r\n(MSG, 20:893.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following epistle, of the same year as the preceding to\r\n    Cæcilianus, is the basis of exemptions of the clergy from public\r\n    duties. The extension of these exemptions was made by the decree\r\n    of 319, given below. Text in Kirch, n. 325.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreeting to thee, our most esteemed Anulinus. Since it appears from many\r\ncircumstances that when that religion is despised in which is preserved\r\nthe chief reverence for the most celestial Power, great dangers are\r\nbrought upon public affairs; but that when legally adopted and observed it\r\naffords most signal prosperity to the Roman name and remarkable felicity\r\nto all the affairs of men, through the divine beneficence, it seemed good\r\nto me, most esteemed Anulinus, that those men who give their services with\r\ndue sanctity and with constant observance of this law to the worship of\r\nthe divine religion should receive recompense for their labors. Wherefore\r\nit is my will that those within the province intrusted to thee, in the\r\nCatholic Church over which Cæcilianus presides, who give their services to\r\nthis holy religion, and who are commonly called clergymen, be entirely\r\nexempted from all public duties, that by any error or sacrilegious\r\nnegligence they may not be drawn away from the service due to the Deity,\r\nbut may devote themselves without any hindrance to their own law. For it\r\nseems that when they show greatest reverence to the Deity the greatest\r\nbenefits accrue to the State. Farewell, our most esteemed and beloved\r\nAnulinus.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 2, 2; A. D. 319.\r\n\r\n\r\n    By the following law the exemption of the clergy from public\r\n    burdens was made universal. As many availed themselves of the\r\n    clerical immunities to escape their burdens as curiales, a law was\r\n    soon afterward passed limiting access to the ministry to those in\r\n    humbler social position. _V. supra_, § 58 _f._\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who in divine worship perform the services of religion—that is,\r\nthose who are called clergy—are altogether exempt from public obligations,\r\nso that they may not be called away from their sacred duties by the\r\nsacrilegious malice of certain persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 2, 4; A. D. 321.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Church is hereby permitted to receive legacies. This was a\r\n    recognition of its corporate character in the law, and indirectly\r\n    its act of incorporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one has permission to leave when he is dying whatsoever goods he\r\nwishes to the most holy Catholic Church.…\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 5, 1; A. D. 326.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Privileges were granted only to the clergy of the Catholic or\r\n    great Church as distinguished from heretics and schismatics. The\r\n    State was, accordingly, forced by its exemptions and privileges\r\n    granted the Church to take up a position as to heresy and schism.\r\n    See for Constantine’s policy toward heresy, Eusebius, _Vita\r\n    Constantini_, III. 64 _ff._ (PNF, ser. II, vol. I.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivileges which have been bestowed in consideration of religion ought to\r\nbe of advantage only to those who observe the Catholic law. It is our will\r\nthat heathen and schismatics be not only without the privileges but bound\r\nby, and subject to, various political burdens.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 2, 5; A. D. 323.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This and the following laws were passed to enable the Christians\r\n    to escape from disadvantages in the carrying out of their\r\n    religion. This law, that Christians should not be compelled to\r\n    sacrifice, was enacted just before the final encounter with\r\n    Licinius.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause we have heard that ecclesiastics and others belonging to the\r\nCatholic religion are compelled by men of different religions to celebrate\r\nthe sacrifices of the lustrum, we, by this decree, do ordain that if any\r\none believes that those who observe the most sacred law ought to be\r\ncompelled to take part in the rites of a strange superstition, let him, if\r\nhis condition permits, be beaten with staves, but if his rank exempts him\r\nfrom such rigor, let him endure the condemnation of a very heavy fine,\r\nwhich shall fall to the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) _Codex Justinianus_; III, 12, 3; A.

By the _Lex Julia et Papia\r\n    Poppea_ it had been forbidden under a fine and loss of rights\r\n    under wills. Childless marriages also rendered the parties liable\r\n    to disabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who are held as celibates by the ancient law are freed from the\r\nthreatened terrors of the laws, and let them so live as if by the compact\r\nof marriage they were among the number of married men, and let all have an\r\nequal standing as to taking what each one deserves. Neither let any one be\r\nheld childless; and let them not suffer the penalties set for this. The\r\nsame thing we hold regarding women, and freely to all we loose from their\r\nnecks the commands which the law placed upon them as a certain yoke. But\r\nthere is no application of this benefit to husbands and wives as regards\r\neach other, whose deceitful wiles are often scarcely restrained by the\r\nappointed rigor of the law, but let the pristine authority of the law\r\ncontinue between such persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 60. The Repression of Heathenism under Constantine\r\n\r\n\r\nConstantine’s religious policy in respect to heathenism may have been from\r\nthe first to establish Christianity as the sole religion of the Empire and\r\nto put down heathenism. If so, in the execution of that policy he\r\nproceeded with great caution, especially in the period before his victory\r\nover Licinius. It looks at times as if for a while he aimed at a parity of\r\nreligions. Certain is the fact that only as conditions became more\r\nfavorable to active measures of repression he increased the severity of\r\nhis laws against what was of doubtful legality in heathenism, though he\r\nwas statesman enough to recognize the difference in the religious\r\nconditions between the East and the West, especially as to the hold which\r\nChristianity had upon the mass of the people. While his measures in the\r\nEast became constantly harsher, in the West he tolerated heathenism. The\r\ncommonly received theory is that Constantine changed his policy. All the\r\nfacts can be as easily understood on the hypothesis that as a statesman he\r\nhad constant regard to the advisability of drastic execution of a policy\r\nwhich he in theory accepted and would have carried out in its entirety\r\neverywhere if he had been able.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Eusebius, _Vita Constantini_ (PNF),\r\n    II. 44 _f._, 47 _f._, 54 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Codex Theodosianus_, IX, 16, 2; A.

The Donatist Schism under Constantine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Donatist schism arose in connection with the Diocletian persecution,\r\nin part over the policy of Mensurius of Carthage regarding the fanatical\r\ndesire for martyrdom and the delivery of the sacred books according to the\r\nedict of persecution. Combined with this were the personal ambitions of\r\nthe Archdeacon Cæcilianus, the offended dignity of the Primas of Numidia,\r\nBishop Secundus of Tigisi, and the pique of a wealthy female devotee,\r\nLucilla. It was mixed up with the customs of the North African church,\r\nwhereby the Primas of Numidia exercised a leading authority in the conduct\r\nof the election of the bishop of Carthage, and also with the notion\r\nprevalent in the same church, for which also Cyprian contended in the\r\ncontroversy on the baptism of heretics [see § 52], that the validity of a\r\nsacrament depended in some way upon the personal character of the minister\r\nof that sacrament. It was asserted by the partisans of Secundus, who\r\nelected Majorinus bishop of Carthage, that Felix of Aptunga, the\r\nconsecrator of Cæcilianus, who had been elected by the other party, had\r\ndelivered the sacred books to the heathen officials, and was therefore\r\nguilty as a traditor. A schism, accordingly, arose in Carthage which\r\nspread rapidly throughout North Africa. The party of Majorinus soon came\r\nunder the lead of Donatus the Great, his successor in the schismatical see\r\nof Carthage. The Donatist schism became of importance almost at once, and\r\nas it was inconsistent with Constantine’s religious policy, which called\r\nfor Church unity,(97) it presented an immediate difficulty in the\r\nexecution of laws granting favors to the Catholic Church.(98) On account\r\nof the interests involved, the schism was of long duration, lasting after\r\nthe conquest of North Africa by the Vandals, and even to the Saracen\r\nconquest, though long since of no importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnulinus. _Ep. ad Constantinum_, in Augustine, _Ep._ 88.

After a few days, however, there arose some,\r\nto whom a crowd of people joined themselves, who thought that proceedings\r\nshould be taken against Cæcilianus and presented me a sealed packet\r\nwrapped in leather and a small document without seal, and earnestly\r\nrequested that I should transmit them to the sacred and venerable court of\r\nyour divinity, which your Majesty’s most humble servant has taken care to\r\ndo, Cæcilianus continuing meanwhile as he was. The acts pertaining to the\r\ncase have been subjoined, in order that your Majesty may be able to make a\r\ndecision concerning the whole matter. I have sent two documents, one in a\r\nleathern envelope entitled “A Document of the Catholic Church, the Charges\r\nagainst Cæcilianus, Furnished by the Party of Majorinus”; the other\r\nattached without a seal to the same leathern envelope. Given on the 17th\r\nday before the calends of May, in the third consulship of our Lord\r\nConstantine Augustus [April 15, 313].\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 62. Constantine’s Endeavors to Bring about the Unity of the Church by\r\nMeans of General Synods: The Councils of Arles and Nicæa\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the intentions of Constantine in his support of Christianity seems\r\nto have been the employment of the Christian religion as a basis for\r\nimperial unity. The policy of several earlier emperors in reviving\r\nheathenism, and Galerius in his persecution of the Christians, seems\r\nlikewise to have been to use religion as a basis of unity. One of the\r\nfirst tasks Constantine encountered after he became sole ruler of the West\r\nwas to restore the unity of the Church in Africa, which had been\r\nendangered by the disputes culminating in the Donatist schism; and when he\r\nbecame sole ruler of the Empire a new task of a similar character was to\r\nrestore unity to the Church of the East, endangered by the Meletian schism\r\nin Egypt [_v. supra_, § 57, _a_], the Arian controversy in its first stage\r\n[_v. infra_, § 63], and the estrangement of the Asia Minor churches, due\r\nto the Easter controversy [_v. supra_, § 38]. It was a master-stroke of\r\npolicy on the part of Constantine to use the Church’s conciliar system on\r\nan enlarged scale to bring about this unity. The Church was made to feel\r\nthat the decision was its own and to be obeyed for religious reasons; at\r\nthe same time the Emperor was able to direct the thought and action of the\r\nassembly in matters of consequence and to give to conciliar action legal\r\nand coercive effect. The two great assemblies summoned to meet the\r\nproblems of the West and of the East were respectively the Councils of\r\nArles, A. D. 314, and of Nicæa, A. D. 325.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

When some began\r\nwickedly and perversely to disagree among themselves in regard to the holy\r\nworship and the celestial power and Catholic doctrine, I, wishing to put\r\nan end to such disputes among them, formerly gave command that certain\r\nbishops should be sent from Gaul, and that the opposing parties, who were\r\ncontending persistently and incessantly with each other, should be\r\nsummoned from Africa; that in their presence and in the presence of the\r\nbishop of Rome the matter which appeared to be causing the disturbance\r\nmight be examined and decided with all care. But since, as it happens,\r\nsome, forgetful both of their own salvation and of the reverence due to\r\nthe most holy religion, do not even yet bring hostilities to an end, and\r\nare unwilling to conform to the judgment already passed, and assert that\r\nthose who expressed their opinions and decisions were few, or that they\r\nhad been too hasty and precipitate in giving judgment, before all the\r\nthings which ought to have been accurately investigated had been\r\nexamined—on account of all this it has happened that those very ones who\r\nought to hold brotherly and harmonious relations toward each other are\r\nshamefully, or rather abominably, divided among themselves, and give\r\noccasion for ridicule to those men whose souls are alien as to this most\r\nholy religion. Wherefore it has seemed necessary to me to provide that\r\nthis dissension, which ought to have ceased after the judgment had been\r\nalready given, by their own voluntary agreement, should now, if possible,\r\nbe brought to an end by the presence of many. Since, therefore, we have\r\ncommanded a number of bishops from a great many different places to\r\nassemble in the city of Arles, before the calends of August, we have\r\nthought proper to write to thee also that thou shouldest secure from the\r\nmost illustrious Latronianus, Corrector of Sicily, a public vehicle, and\r\nthat thou shouldest take with thee two others of the second rank whom thou\r\nthyself shalt choose, together with three servants, who may serve you on\r\nthe way, and betake thyself to the above-mentioned place before the\r\nappointed day; that by thy firmness and by the wise unanimity and harmony\r\nof the others present, this dispute, which has disgracefully continued\r\nuntil the present time, in consequence of certain shameful strifes, after\r\nall has been heard, which those have to say who are now at variance with\r\none another, and whom we have likewise commanded to be present, may be\r\nsettled in accordance with the proper faith, and that brotherly harmony,\r\nthough it be but gradual, may be restored. May Almighty God preserve thee\r\nin health many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Synodal Epistle addressed to Sylvester, Bishop of Rome_, Bruns, II,\r\n107. _Cf._ Kirch, nn. 330-337.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following extracts give the canons of most importance in the\r\n    history of the times. The exact wording of the canons has not been\r\n    retained in the letter, which is the only record extant of the\r\n    action of the council. The text from which the following is\r\n    translated is that given by the monks of St. Maur in their\r\n    _Collectio Conciliorum Galliæ_, reprinted by Hefele, § 15, and\r\n    Bruns, _Canones Apostolorum et Conciliorum_, II, 107 _ff._ It is\r\n    to be preferred to the text of Mansi and the older collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first canon settled for the West the long-standing question as\r\n    to the date of Easter. The Roman custom as to the day of the week\r\n    and computation of the time of year should be followed everywhere;\r\n    the same decision was reached at Nicæa for the East (_v. __§ 62,\r\n    II, a_). As a matter of fact, however, the computation customary\r\n    at Alexandria eventually prevailed as the more accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The eighth and thirteenth canons touch upon North African\r\n    disputes. The former overrules the contention of Cyprian and his\r\n    colleagues, that heretical or schismatical baptisms were invalid.\r\n    It also laid down a principle by which Novatianism stood\r\n    condemned. The thirteenth applied a similar principle to\r\n    ordination; the crimes of the bishop who gave the ordination\r\n    should not invalidate the ordination of a suitable person, as was\r\n    claimed in the case of the ordination of Cæcilianus by Felix of\r\n    Aptunga, accused as a _traditor_; further it ruled out the\r\n    complaints against Felix until more substantial proof be brought,\r\n    the official documents that he had made the tradition required by\r\n    the edict of persecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarinus and the assembly of bishops, who have come together in the town of\r\nArles, to the most holy lord and brother Sylvester. What we have decreed\r\nwith general consent we signify to your charity that all may know what\r\nought to be observed in the future.\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, concerning the observation of the Lord’s Easter, we\r\nhave determined that it be observed on one day and at one time throughout\r\nthe world by us, and that you send letters according to custom to all.\r\n\r\n8. Concerning the Africans, because they make use of their own law, to the\r\neffect that they rebaptize, we have determined that if any one should come\r\nfrom heresy to the Church they should ask him the creed; and if they\r\nshould perceive that he had been baptized in the name of the Father and of\r\nthe Son and of the Holy Ghost, hands only should be laid upon him that he\r\nmight receive the Holy Ghost. That if when asked he should not reply this\r\nTrinity, let him be baptized.\r\n\r\n9. Concerning those who bring letters of the confessors, it pleased us\r\nthat these letters having been taken away, they should receive other\r\nletters of communion.\r\n\r\n13. Concerning those who are said to have given up the Holy Scriptures or\r\nthe vessels of the Lord or the name of their brethren, it has pleased us\r\nwhoever of them shall have been convicted by public documents and not by\r\nmere words, should be removed from the clerical order; though if the same\r\nhave been found to have ordained any, and those whom they have ordained\r\nare worthy, it shall not render their ordination invalid. And because\r\nthere are many who are seen to oppose the law of the Church and think that\r\nthey ought to be admitted to bring accusation by hired witnesses, they are\r\nby no means to be admitted, except, as we have said above, they can prove\r\ntheir accusations by public documents.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Council of Nicæa\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the Council of Nicæa, see Hefele, §§ 18-44. All church\r\n    histories give large space to the Council of Nicæa. _V. infra, §§\r\n    __63__ ff., __72, a_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Council of Nicæa, 325. _Synodical Letter_, Socrates, _Hist. Ec._ I,\r\n9. (MSG, 67 :77.) Text in Kirch, nn. 369 _ff._; Mirbt, n. 107.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the holy and, by the grace of God, great Church of the Alexandrians,\r\nand to our beloved brethren throughout Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis, the\r\nbishops assembled at Nicæa constituting the great and holy synod, send\r\ngreetings in the Lord.\r\n\r\nSince by the grace of God, a great and holy synod has been convened at\r\nNicæa, our most pious sovereign Constantine having summoned us out of\r\nvarious cities and provinces for that purpose, it appeared to us\r\nindispensably necessary that a letter should be written also to you on the\r\npart of the sacred synod; in order that you may know what subjects were\r\nbrought under consideration, what rigidly investigated, and also what was\r\neventually determined on and decreed. In the first place, the impiety and\r\nguilt of Arius and his adherents were examined into, in the presence of\r\nour most pious Emperor Constantine: and it was unanimously decided that\r\nhis impious opinion be anathematized, with all the blasphemous expressions\r\nand terms he has blasphemously uttered, affirming that the Son of God\r\nsprang from nothing, and that there was a time when He was not; saying,\r\nmoreover, that the Son of God was possessed of a free will, so as to be\r\ncapable either of vice or virtue; and calling Him a creature and a work.\r\nAll these the holy synod has anathematized, having scarcely patience to\r\nendure the hearing of such an impious or, rather, bewildered opinion, and\r\nsuch abominable blasphemies. But the conclusion of our proceedings against\r\nhim you must either have heard or will hear; for we would not seem to\r\ntrample on a man who has received the chastisement which his crime\r\ndeserved. Yet so strong is his impiety as to involve Theonas, Bishop of\r\nMarmarica, and Secundus of Ptolemais; for they have suffered the same\r\ncondemnation as himself. But the grace of God freed us from this false\r\ndoctrine, impiety, and blasphemy, and from those persons who have dared to\r\ncause discord and division among the people previously at peace; and there\r\nstill remained the contumacy of Meletius to be dealt with, and those who\r\nhad been ordained by him; and we shall now state to you, beloved brethren,\r\nwhat resolution the synod came to on this point. Acting with more clemency\r\ntoward Meletius, although, strictly speaking, he was wholly undeserving of\r\nfavor, the council permitted him to remain in his own city, but decreed\r\nthat he should exercise no authority either to ordain or nominate for\r\nordination; and that he should appear in no other district or city on this\r\npretence, but simply retain a nominal dignity; that those who had received\r\nappointments from him, after having been confirmed by a more legitimate\r\nordination, should be admitted to communion on these conditions: that they\r\nshould continue to hold their rank and ministry, but regard themselves as\r\ninferior in every respect to all those who had been previously ordained\r\nand established in each place and church by our most honored\r\nfellow-minister Alexander. In addition to these things, they shall have no\r\nauthority to propose or nominate whom they please, or to do anything at\r\nall without the concurrence of a bishop of the Catholic Church, who is one\r\nof Alexander’s suffragans. Let such as by the grace of God and your\r\nprayers have been found in no schism, but have continued in the Catholic\r\nChurch blameless, have authority to nominate and ordain those who are\r\nworthy of the sacred office, and to act in all things according to\r\necclesiastical law and usage. Whenever it may happen that any of those\r\nplaced in the Church die, then let such as have been recently admitted\r\ninto orders be advanced to the dignity of the deceased, provided that they\r\nappear worthy, and that the people should elect them, and the bishop of\r\nAlexandria confirm their choice. This is conceded to all the others,\r\nindeed, but as for Meletius personally we by no means grant the same, on\r\naccount of his formerly disorderly conduct; and because of the rashness\r\nand levity of his character he is deprived of all authority and\r\njurisdiction, as a man liable again to create similar disturbances. These\r\nare things which specially affect Egypt and the most holy Church of the\r\nAlexandrians; and if any other canon or ordinance should be established,\r\nour lord and most honored fellow-minister and brother Alexander being\r\npresent with us, will on his return to you enter into more minute details,\r\ninasmuch as he is not only a participator in whatever is transacted, but\r\nhas the principal direction of it. We have also to announce the good news\r\nto you concerning the unanimity as to the holy feast of Easter: that this\r\nby your prayers has been settled so that all the brethren in the East, who\r\nhave hitherto kept this festival with the Jews, will henceforth conform to\r\nthe Romans and to us, and to all who from the earliest times have observed\r\nour period of celebrating Easter. Rejoicing, therefore, on account of a\r\nfavorable termination of matters and in the extirpation of all heresy,\r\nreceive with the greater honor and more abundant love our fellow-minister\r\nand your bishop, Alexander, who has greatly delighted us by his presence,\r\nand even at his advanced age has undergone extraordinary exertions in\r\norder that peace might be re-established among you. Pray on behalf of us\r\nall, that the decisions to which we have so justly come may be inviolably\r\nmaintained through Almighty God and our Lord Jesus Christ, together with\r\nthe Holy Spirit to whom be glory forever. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Council of Nicæa, Canon 8, _On the Novatians_, Bruns. I, 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Church recognized the substantial orthodoxy of the Novatians,\r\n    and according to the principles laid down at Arles (cc. 8, 13, §\r\n    62 _I, b_) the ordination of the Novatians was regarded as valid.\r\n    The following canon, although a generous concession on the part of\r\n    the Church, did not bring about a healing of the schism which\r\n    lasted several centuries. The last mention of the Novatians is\r\n    contained in the 95th canon of the second Trullan Council, known\r\n    as the Quinisext, A. D. 692.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 8. Concerning those who call themselves Cathari, who come over to\r\nthe Catholic and Apostolic Church, the great and holy synod decrees that\r\nthey who are ordained shall continue as they are among the clergy. But\r\nbefore all things it is necessary that they should profess in writing that\r\nthey will observe and follow the teachings of the Catholic and Apostolic\r\nChurch; that is, that they will communicate with those who have been twice\r\nmarried and with those who have lapsed during the persecution, and upon\r\nwhom a period of penance has been laid and a time for restoration fixed;\r\nso that in all things they will follow the teachings of the Catholic\r\nChurch. Wheresoever, then, whether in villages or in cities, only these\r\nare found who have been ordained, let them remain as found among the\r\nclergy and in the same rank. But if any come over where there is a bishop\r\nor presbyter of the Catholic Church, it is manifest that the bishop of the\r\nChurch must have the dignity of a bishop, and he who was named bishop by\r\nthose who are called Cathari shall have the honor of a presbyter, unless\r\nit seem fit to the bishop to share with him the honor of the title. But if\r\nthis should not seem good to him, then shall the bishop provide for him a\r\nplace as chorepiscopus, or as presbyter, in order that he may be evidently\r\nseen to be of the clergy, and that in one city there may not be two\r\nbishops.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 5, 2; A. D. 326.\r\n\r\n\r\n    With the generous treatment of the Novatians by the Council of\r\n    Nicæa should be compared the mild and generous treatment of\r\n    Constantine, who distinguished them from other heretics.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have not learned that the Novatians have been so condemned that we\r\nbelieve that to them should not be granted what they claim. Therefore we\r\nprescribe as to the buildings of their churches and places suitable for\r\nburial that they are to possess, without any molestation, those buildings\r\nand lands, namely, which on ground of long possession or from purchase or\r\nclaim for any sound reason they may have. It will be well looked out for\r\nthat they attempt to claim nothing for themselves of those things which\r\nbefore their secession belonged evidently to the churches of perpetual\r\nsanctity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. The Arian Controversy Until The Extinction Of The Dynasty Of\r\nConstantine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arian controversy may be divided into four periods or stadia:\r\n\r\n1. From the outbreak of the Arian controversy to the Council of Nicæa\r\n(318-325). In this stadium the positions of the parties are defined, and\r\nthe position of the West, in substantial agreement with that of Alexander\r\nand Athanasius, forced through by Constantine and Hosius at Nicæa (§ 63).\r\n\r\n2. From the Council of Nicæa to the death of Constantine (325-337). In\r\nthis stadium, without the setting aside of the formula of Nicæa, an\r\nattempt is made to reconcile those who in fact dissented. In this period\r\nConstantine, now living in the East, inclines toward a position more in\r\nharmony with Arianism and more acceptable in the East than was the\r\ndoctrine of Athanasius. This is the period of the Eusebian reaction (§\r\n64).\r\n\r\n3. From the death of Constantine to the death of Constantius (337-361). In\r\nthis stadium the anti-Nicæan party is victorious in the East (§ 65), but\r\nas it included all those who for any reason were opposed to the definition\r\nof Nicæa, it fell apart on attaining the annulment of the decision of\r\nNicæa. There arose, on the one hand, an extreme Arian party and, on the\r\nother, a homoiousian party which approximated closely to the Athanasian\r\nposition but feared the Nicene terminology.\r\n\r\n4. From the accession of Julian to the council of Constantinople\r\n(361-381). Under the pressure brought against Christianity by Julian (§\r\n68), parties but little removed from each other came closer together (§\r\n70). A new generation of theologians took the lead, with an interpretation\r\nof the Nicene formula which made it acceptable to those who had previously\r\nregarded it as Sabellian. And under the lead of these men, backed by the\r\nEmperor Theodosius, the reaffirmation of the Nicene formula at\r\nConstantinople, 381, was accepted by the East (§ 71).\r\n\r\nIn the period in which the Arian controversy is by far the most important\r\nseries of events in Church history, the attitude of the sons of\r\nConstantine toward heathenism and Donatism was of secondary importance,\r\nbut it should be noticed as throwing light on the ecclesiastical policy\r\nwhich made the Arian controversy so momentous. In their policy toward\r\nheathenism and dissent, the policy of Constantine was carried to its\r\nlogical completion in the establishment of Christianity as the only lawful\r\nreligion of the Empire (§ 67).\r\n\r\nArianism may be regarded as the last attempt of Dynamistic Monarchianism\r\n(_v. supra_, § 40) to explain the divinity of Jesus Christ without\r\nadmitting His eternity. It was derived in part from the teaching of Paul\r\nof Samosata through Lucian of Antioch. Paul of Samosata had admitted the\r\nexistence of an eternal but impersonal Logos in God which dwelt in the man\r\nJesus. Arianism distinguished between a Logos uncreated, an eternal\r\nimpersonal reason in God, and a personal Logos created in time, making the\r\nlatter, the personal Logos, only in a secondary sense God. This latter\r\nLogos, neither eternal nor uncreated, became incarnate in Jesus, taking\r\nthe place in the human personality of the rational soul or logos. To guard\r\nagainst the worship of a being created and temporal, and to avoid the\r\nassertion of two eternal existences, the anti-Arian or Athanasian\r\nposition, already formulated by Alexander, made the personal Logos of one\r\nessence or substance with the Father, eternal as the Father, and thereby\r\ndistinguishing between begetting, or the imparting of subsistence, and\r\ncreating, or the calling into being from nothing, a distinction which\r\nArianism failed to make; and thus allowing for the eternity and deity of\r\nthe Son without detracting from the monotheism which was universally\r\nregarded as the fundamental doctrine of Christianity as a body of\r\ntheology. In this controversy the party of Alexander and Athanasius was\r\nanimated, at least in the earlier stages of the controversy, not so much\r\nby speculative interests as by religious motives, the relation of Jesus to\r\nredemption, and they were strongly influenced by Irenæus. The party of\r\nArius, on the other hand, was influenced by metaphysical interests as to\r\nthe relation of being to creation and the contrast between the finite and\r\nthe infinite. It may be said, in general, that until the council of\r\nChalcedon, and possibly even after that, the main interest that kept alive\r\ntheological discussion was intimately connected with vital problems of\r\nreligious life of the times. After that the scholastic period began to set\r\nin and metaphysical discussions were based upon the formulæ of the\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 63. The Outbreak of the Arian Controversy and the Council of Nicæa, A.\r\nD. 325\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arian controversy began in Alexandria about 318, as related by\r\nSocrates (_a_). The positions of the two parties were defined from the\r\nbeginning both by Alexander, bishop of Alexandria (_b_), and Arius himself\r\n(_c_), who by appealing to Eusebius of Nicomedia, his fellow-student in\r\nthe school of Lucian of Antioch, enlisted the support of that able\r\necclesiastical politician and courtier and at once extended the area of\r\nthe controversy throughout the East. By means of poems of a somewhat\r\npopular character entitled the _Thalia_, about 322 (_d_), Arius spread his\r\ndoctrines still further, involving others than the trained professional\r\ntheologian. In the meanwhile Arius and some other clergy sympathizing with\r\nhim in Egypt were deposed about 320 (_e_). Constantine endeavored to end\r\nthe dispute by a letter, and, failing in this, sent Hosius of Cordova, his\r\nadviser in ecclesiastical matters, to Alexandria in 324. On the advice of\r\nHosius, a synod was called to meet at Nicæa in the next year, after the\r\npattern of the earlier synod for the West at Arles in 314. Here the basis\r\nfor a definition of faith was a non-committal creed presented by Eusebius\r\nof Cæsarea, the Church historian (_f_). This was modified, probably under\r\nthe influence of Hosius, so as to be in harmony at once with the tenets of\r\nthe party of Alexander and Athanasius, and with the characteristic\r\ntheology of the West (_g_).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: J.

By chance, one day,\r\nin the presence of the presbyters and the rest of his clergy, he was\r\ndiscussing too ambitiously the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, teaching that\r\nthere was a unity in the Trinity. But Arius, one of the presbyters under\r\nhis jurisdiction, a man of no inconsiderable logical acumen, imagining\r\nthat the bishop was subtly introducing the doctrine of Sabellius the\r\nLibyan, from the love of controversy took the opposite opinion to that of\r\nthe Libyan, and, as he thought, vigorously responded to the things said by\r\nthe bishop. “If,” said he, “the Father begat the Son, He that was begotten\r\nhad a beginning of existence; and from this it is evident that there was a\r\ntime when the Son was not. It follows necessarily that He had His\r\nsubsistence [hypostasis] from nothing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Alexander of Alexandria. _Ep. ad Alexandrum_, in Theodoret, _Hist.\r\nEc._, I, 3.

The omissions in the extract are of the less\r\n    important glosses and proof-texts. For the position of Alexander\r\n    the letter of Arius to Eusebius of Nicomedia given below (_c_)\r\n    should also be examined.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe as the Apostolic Church teaches, In one unbegotten Father, who\r\nof His being has no cause, immutable and invariable, and who subsists\r\nalways in one state of being, admitting neither of progression nor\r\ndiminution; who gave the law and the prophets and the Gospel; of\r\npatriarchs and Apostles and all saints, Lord; and in one Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, the only begotten Son of God, begotten not out of that which is\r\nnot, but of the Father, who is; yet not after the manner of material\r\nbodies, by severance or emanation, as Sabellius and Valentinus taught, but\r\nin an inexpressible and inexplicable manner.… We have learned that the Son\r\nis immutable and unchangeable, all-sufficient and perfect, like the\r\nFather, lacking only His “unbegottenness.” He is the exact and precisely\r\nsimilar image of His Father.… And in accordance with this we believe that\r\nthe Son always existed of the Father.… Therefore His own individual\r\ndignity must be reserved to the Father as the Unbegotten One, no one being\r\ncalled the cause of His existence: to the Son, likewise, must be given the\r\nhonor which befits Him, there being to Him a generation from the Father\r\nwhich has no beginning.… And in addition to this pious belief respecting\r\nthe Father and the Son, we confess as the sacred Scriptures teach us, one\r\nHoly Spirit, who moved the saints of the Old Testament, and the divine\r\nteachers of that which is called the New. We believe in one and only\r\nCatholic and Apostolic Church, which can never be destroyed even though\r\nall the world were to take counsel to fight against it, and which gains\r\nthe victory over all the impious attacks of the heterodox.… After this we\r\nreceive the resurrection from the dead, of which Jesus Christ our Lord\r\nbecame the first-fruits; who bore a body, in truth, not in semblance,\r\nderived from Mary, the mother of God [theotokos] in the fulness of time\r\nsojourning among the race, for the remission of sins: who was crucified\r\nand died, yet for all this suffered no diminution of His Godhead. He rose\r\nfrom the dead, was taken into heaven, and sat down on the right hand of\r\nthe Majesty on high.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Arius, _Ep. ad Eusebium_, in Theodoret, _Hist. Ec._, I, 4. (MSG,\r\n88:909.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    A statement in the words of Arius of his own position and that of\r\n    Alexander addressed to Eusebius of Nicomedia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo his very dear lord, the man of God, the faithful and orthodox Eusebius,\r\nArius unjustly persecuted by Alexander the Pope, on account of that\r\nall-conquering truth of which you are also the champion, sendeth greeting\r\nin the Lord.\r\n\r\n… Alexander has driven us out of the city as atheists, because we do not\r\nconcur in what he publicly preaches; namely, “God is always, the Son is\r\nalways; as the Father so the Son; the Son coexists unbegotten with God; He\r\nis everlastingly begotten; He is the unbegotten begotten; neither by\r\nthought nor by any interval does God precede the Son; always God, always\r\nthe Son; the Son is of God himself.”… To these impieties we cannot listen\r\neven though heretics threaten us with a thousand deaths. But we say and\r\nbelieve and have taught and do teach, that the Son is not unbegotten, nor\r\nin any way part of the Unbegotten; nor from any substance\r\n[hypokeimenon],(99) but that of His own will and counsel He has subsisted\r\nbefore time and before ages, as perfect God only begotten and\r\nunchangeable, and that before He was begotten or created or purposed or\r\nestablished He was not. For He was not unbegotten. We are persecuted\r\nbecause we say that the Son has a beginning, but that God is without\r\nbeginning. This is the cause of our persecution, and likewise because we\r\nsay that He is of that which is not.(100) And this we say because He is\r\nneither part of God, nor of any substance [hypokeimenon]. For this we are\r\npersecuted; the rest you know. I bid thee farewell in the Lord,\r\nremembering our afflictions, my fellow-Lucianist and true Eusebius\r\n[_i.e._, pious].\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Arius, _Thalia_, in Athanasius, _Orat. contra Arianos_, I, 2. (MSG,\r\n26:21.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following extracts from the _Thalia_, although given by\r\n    Athanasius, the opponent of Arius, are so in harmony with what\r\n    Arius and his followers asserted repeatedly that they may be\r\n    regarded as correctly representing the work from which they\r\n    profess to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nGod was not always Father; but there was when God was alone and was not\r\nyet Father; afterward He became a Father. The Son was not always; for\r\nsince all things have come into existence from nothing, and all things are\r\ncreatures and have been made, so also the Logos of God himself came into\r\nexistence from nothing and there was a time when He was not; and that\r\nbefore He came into existence He was not; but He also had a beginning of\r\nHis being created. For God, he says, was alone and not yet was there the\r\nLogos and Wisdom. Afterward He willed to create us, then He made a certain\r\none and named Him Logos and Wisdom and Son, in order that by Him He might\r\ncreate us. He says, therefore, that there are two wisdoms, one proper to,\r\nand existing together with, God; but the Son came into existence by that\r\nwisdom, and was made a partaker of it and was only named Wisdom and Logos.\r\nFor Wisdom existed by wisdom and the will of God’s wisdom. So, he says,\r\nthat there is another Logos besides the Son in God, and the Son partaking\r\nof that Logos is again named Logos and Son by grace.… There are many\r\npowers; and there is one which is by nature proper to God and eternal; but\r\nChrist, again, is not the true power of God, but is one of those which are\r\ncalled powers, of whom also the locust and the caterpillar are called not\r\nonly a power but a great power [Joel 2:2], and there are many other things\r\nlike to the Son, concerning whom David says in the Psalms: “The Lord of\r\nPowers”;(101) likewise the Logos is mutable, as are all things, and by His\r\nown free choice, so far as He wills, remains good; because when He wills\r\nHe is able to change, as also we are, since His nature is subject to\r\nchange. Then, says he, God foreseeing that He would be good, gave by\r\nanticipation to Him that glory, which as a man He afterward had from His\r\nvirtue; so that on account of His works, which God foresaw, God made Him\r\nto become such as He is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Council of Alexandria, A. D. 320, _Epistula encyclica_, in Socrates,\r\n_Hist. Ec._, I, 6. (MSG, 67:45.) _Cf._ Kirch, nn. 353 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The encyclical of the Council of Alexandria under Alexander, in\r\n    which Arius and his sympathizers were deposed, was possibly\r\n    composed by Athanasius. It is commonly found in his works,\r\n    entitled _Depositio Arii_. It is also found in the _Ecclesiastical\r\n    History_ of Socrates. For council, see Hefele, § 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who became apostates were Arius, Achillas, Æithales, Carpones,\r\nanother Arius, and Sarmates, who were then presbyters; Euzoius, Lucius,\r\nJulianus, Menas, Helladius, and Gaius, who were then deacons; and with\r\nthem Secundus and Theonas, then called bishops. And the novelties which\r\nthey have invented and put forth contrary to the Scriptures are the\r\nfollowing: God was not always a Father, but there was a time when He was\r\nnot a Father. The Logos of God was not always, but came into existence\r\nfrom things that were not; wherefore there was a time when He was not; for\r\nthe Son is a creature and a work. Neither is He like in essence to the\r\nFather. Neither is He truly by nature the Logos of the Father; neither is\r\nHe His true Wisdom; but He is one of the things made and created, and is\r\ncalled the Logos and Wisdom by an abuse of terms, since He himself\r\noriginated by God’s own logos and by the wisdom that is in God, by which\r\nGod has made not only all things but Him also. Wherefore He is in His\r\nnature subject to change and variation as are all rational creatures. And\r\nthe Logos is foreign, is alien and separated from the being [_ousia_] of\r\nGod. And the Father cannot be(102) described by the Son, for the Logos\r\ndoes not know the Father perfectly and accurately, neither can He see Him\r\nperfectly. Moreover, the Son knows not His own essence as it really is;\r\nfor He was made on account of us, that God might create us by Him as by an\r\ninstrument; and He would not have existed had not God willed to create us.\r\nAccordingly some one asked them whether the Logos of God is able to change\r\nas the devil changed, and they were not afraid to say that He can change;\r\nfor being something made and created, His nature is subject to change.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Eusebius of Cæsarea, _Creed_, in Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, I, 8. (MSG,\r\n67:69.) _Cf._ Hahn, § 188.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This creed was presented at the Council of Nicæa by the historian\r\n    Eusebius, who took the lead of the middle party at the council. He\r\n    stated that it had long been in use in his church.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe in one God, Father Almighty, the maker of all things visible\r\nand invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Logos of God, God of God,\r\nLight of Light, Life of Life, only begotten Son, the first-born of all\r\ncreation, begotten of His Father before all ages, by whom, also, all\r\nthings were made, who for our salvation became flesh, who lived among men,\r\nand suffered and rose again on the third day, and ascended to the Father,\r\nand will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead. We believe\r\nalso in one Holy Spirit. We believe that each of these [_i.e._, three] is\r\nand subsists;(103) the Father truly Father, the Son truly Son; the Holy\r\nSpirit truly Holy Spirit; as our Lord also said, when He sent His\r\ndisciples to preach: “Go teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of\r\nthe Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” [Matt. 28:19].\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Council of Nicæa A. D. 325, _Creed_, in Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, I, 8.\r\n(MSG, 67:68.) _Cf._ Hahn, § 142.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The creed of Nicæa is to be carefully distinguished from what is\r\n    commonly called the Nicene creed. The actual creed put forth at\r\n    the council is as follows. The discussion by Loofs,\r\n    _Dogmengeschichte_, § 32, is brief but especially important, as he\r\n    shows that the creed was drawn up under the influence of the\r\n    Western formulæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe in one God, Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and\r\ninvisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of His\r\nFather, only begotten, that is of the _ousia_ of the Father, God of God,\r\nLight of Light, true God of true God; begotten, not made, of one\r\nsubstance(104) with the Father, by whom all things were made, both things\r\nin heaven and things in earth, who for us men and for our salvation, came\r\ndown from heaven and was made [became] flesh and was made [became] man,\r\nsuffered and rose again on the third day, ascended into the heavens and\r\ncomes to judge living and dead. And in the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nBut those who say there was when He was not, and before being begotten He\r\nwas not, and He was made out of things that were not(105) or those who say\r\nthat the Son of God was from a different substance [hypostasis] or being\r\n[_ousia_] or a creature, or capable of change or alteration, these the\r\nCatholic Church anathematizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 64. The Beginnings of the Eusebian Reaction under Constantine\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the Council of Nicæa, Constantine seems to have become aware\r\nof the fact that the decision at that council was not acceptable in the\r\nEast as a whole, representing, as it did, what was generally felt to be an\r\nextreme position. In coming to this opinion he was much influenced by\r\nEusebius of Nicomedia who, by powerful court interest, was soon recalled\r\nfrom exile and even became the leading ecclesiastical adviser of\r\nConstantine. The policy of this bishop was to prepare the way for the\r\nrevocation of the decree of Nicæa by a preliminary rehabilitation of Arius\r\n(_a_), and by attacking the leaders of the opposite party (_b_).\r\nConstantine, however, never consented to the abrogation of the creed of\r\nNicæa.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, I, 8 (letter of\r\n    Eusebius to his diocese), 14, 28 ff. _Eusebius, Vita Constantini_,\r\n    III, 23; Athanasius, _Historia Arianorum_, §§ 4-7.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Arius, _Confession of Faith_, in Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, I, 26. (MSG,\r\n67:149.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    As a part of the process whereby Arius should be rehabilitated by\r\n    being received back into the Church he was invited by Constantine\r\n    to appear at the court. He was there presented to the Emperor and\r\n    produced a confession of faith purposely vague and general in\r\n    statement, but intended to give the impression that he held the\r\n    essentials of the received orthodoxy. The text is that given by\r\n    Hahn, § 187.\r\n\r\n\r\nArius and Euzoius to our most religious and pious Lord, the Emperor\r\nConstantine.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the command of your devout piety, sovereign lord, we\r\ndeclare our faith, and before God we profess in writing that we and our\r\nadherents believe as follows:\r\n\r\nWe believe in one God, the Father Almighty; and in the Lord Jesus Christ\r\nHis Son, who was made by Him before all ages, God the Word, through whom\r\nall things were made, both those which are in heaven and those upon earth;\r\nwho descended, and became incarnate, and suffered, and rose again,\r\nascended into the heavens, and will again come to judge the living and the\r\ndead. Also in the Holy Spirit, and in the resurrection of the flesh, and\r\nin the life of the coming age, and in the kingdom of the heavens, and in\r\none Catholic Church of God, extending from one end of the earth to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThis faith we have received from the holy gospels, the Lord therein saying\r\nto His disciples: “Go teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the\r\nFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” If we do not so believe\r\nand truly receive the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as the whole Catholic\r\nChurch and the Holy Scriptures teach (in which we believe in every\r\nrespect) God is our judge both now and in the coming judgment. Wherefore\r\nwe beseech your piety, most devout Emperor, that we who are persons\r\nconsecrated to the ministry, and holding the faith and sentiments of the\r\nChurch and of the Holy Scriptures, may by your pacific and devoted piety\r\nbe reunited to our mother, the Church, all superfluous questions and\r\ndisputings being avoided; that so both we and the whole Church may be at\r\npeace and in common offer our accustomed prayers for your tranquil reign\r\nand on behalf of your whole family.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, I, 23. (MSG, 67:140.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The attack of the Arians upon Athanasius and his party.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe partisans of Eusebius and Theognis having returned from their exile,\r\nthey received again their churches, having expelled, as we observed, those\r\nwho had been ordained in their stead. Moreover they came into great\r\nconsideration with the Emperor, who honored them exceedingly, as those who\r\nhad returned from error to the orthodox faith. They, however, abused the\r\nlicense granted them by exciting commotions in the world greater than\r\nbefore; being instigated to this by two causes—on the one hand, the Arian\r\nheresy with which they had been previously infected, and on the other\r\nhand, by animosity against Athanasius because in the synod he had so\r\nvigorously withstood them in the discussion of the articles of the faith.\r\nAnd in the first place they objected to the ordination of Athanasius, not\r\nonly as of one unworthy of the episcopate, but also as of one not elected\r\nby qualified persons. But when he had shown himself superior to this\r\ncalumny (for having assumed direction of the Church of the Alexandrians,\r\nhe ardently contended for the Nicene creed), then the adherents of\r\nEusebius exerted themselves to cause the removal of Athanasius and to\r\nbring Arius back to Alexandria; for thus only did they think they should\r\nbe able to cast out the doctrine of consubstantiality and introduce\r\nArianism. Eusebius therefore wrote to Athanasius to receive Arius and his\r\nadherents; and when he wrote he not only entreated him, but he openly\r\nthreatened him. When Athanasius would by no means accede to this he\r\nendeavored to persuade the Emperor to receive Arius in audience and then\r\npermit him to return to Alexandria; and how he accomplished these things I\r\nshall tell in its proper place.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, before this, another commotion was raised in the Church. In\r\nfact those of the household of the Church again disturbed her peace.\r\nEusebius Pamphilius says that immediately after the synod Egypt became\r\nagitated by intestine divisions; but he does not give the reason for this.\r\nFrom this he has gained the reputation of being disingenuous and of\r\navoiding the specification of the causes of these dissensions from a\r\ndetermination on his part not to give his sanction to the proceedings at\r\nNicæa. Yet as we ourselves have discovered from various letters which the\r\nbishops wrote to one another after the synod, the term homoousios troubled\r\nsome of them. So that while they occupied themselves about it,\r\ninvestigating it very minutely, they roused the strife against each other.\r\nIt seemed not unlike a contest in the dark; for neither party appeared to\r\nunderstand distinctly the grounds on which they calumniated one another.\r\nThose who objected to the word homoousios conceived that those who\r\napproved it favored the opinion of Sabellius and Montanus; they therefore\r\ncalled them blasphemers, as subverting the existence of the Son of God.\r\nAnd again those who defended the term, charging their opponents with\r\npolytheism, inveighed against them as introducers of heathen\r\nsuperstitions. Eustathius, bishop of Antioch, accuses Eusebius Pamphilius\r\nof perverting the Nicene creed; Eusebius again denies that he violates\r\nthat exposition of the faith, and accuses Eustathius of introducing the\r\nopinion of Sabellius. Therefore each of them wrote as if contending\r\nagainst adversaries; but both sides admitted that the Son of God has a\r\ndistinct person and existence, confessing that there is one God in three\r\npersons (hypostases) yet they were unable to agree, for what cause I do\r\nnot know, and could in no way be at peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 65. The Victory of the Anti-Nicene Party in the East\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Constantine died in 337 the party of Eusebius of Nicomedia was\r\ncompletely in the ascendant in the East. A council at Antioch, 339,\r\ndeposed Athanasius, and he was expelled from Alexandria, and Gregory of\r\nCappadocia was consecrated in his place. Athanasius, with Marcellus of\r\nAncyra and other supporters of the Nicene faith, repaired to Rome where\r\nthey were supported by Julius, bishop of Rome, at a well-attended local\r\ncouncil in 340 (_a__, __b_). In the East numerous attempts were made to\r\nformulate a confession of faith which might take the place of the Nicene\r\ncreed and prove acceptable to all parties. The most important of these\r\nwere produced at the Council of Antioch, 341, at which no less than four\r\ncreeds were formulated (_c__, __d_).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Percival, _The Seven Ecumenical\r\n    Councils_ (PNF, ser. II, vol. XIV); Socrates, _Hist. Ec._ (PNF,\r\n    ser. II, vol. II), II, 19 (Formula Macrostichos); Athanasius, _De\r\n    Synodis_ (PNF, ser. II, vol. IV).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Athanasius, _Apologia contra Arianos_, 20. (MSG, 25:280.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Athanasius and his allies in exile in the West are exonerated at\r\n    Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eusebians wrote also to Julius, thinking to frighten me, requesting\r\nhim to call a council, and Julius himself to be the judge if he pleased.\r\nWhen, therefore, I went up to Rome, Julius wrote to the Eusebians, as was\r\nsuitable, and sent moreover two of his presbyters, Elpidius and\r\nPhiloxenus. But when they heard of me they became confused, because they\r\ndid not expect that we would come up; and they declined, alleging absurd\r\nreasons for so doing, but in truth fearing lest the things should be\r\nproved against them which Valens and Ursacius afterward confessed.\r\nHowever, more than fifty bishops assembled in the place where the\r\npresbyter Vito held his congregation, and they acknowledged my defence and\r\ngave me the confirmation both of their communion and their love. On the\r\nother hand, they expressed great indignation against the Eusebians and\r\nrequested that Julius write to the following effect to them who had\r\nwritten to him. And he wrote and sent it by Count Gabienus.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Julius of Rome, _Epistula_, in Athanasius. _Apologia contra\r\nArianos_, §§ 26 _ff._ (MSG, 25:292.)\r\n\r\n\r\nJulius to his dearly beloved brethren, Danius, Flacillus, Narcissus,\r\nEusebius, and Matis, Macedonius, Theodorus, and their friends, who have\r\nwritten him from Antioch, sends health in the Lord.\r\n\r\n§ 26. … It is necessary for me to inform you that although I alone wrote,\r\nyet it was not my opinion only, but of all the bishops throughout Italy\r\nand in these parts. I, indeed, was unwilling to cause them all to write,\r\nlest they might have weight by mere numbers. The bishops, however,\r\nassembled on the appointed day, and agreed in these opinions, which I\r\nagain write to signify to you; so that, dearly beloved, although I alone\r\naddress you, yet you may know it is the opinion of all.…\r\n\r\n§ 27. That we have not admitted to our communion our fellow-bishops\r\nAthanasius and Marcellus either hastily or unjustly, although sufficiently\r\nshown above, it is but fair to set briefly before you. The Eusebians first\r\nwrote against Athanasius and his fellows, and you have also written now;\r\nbut many bishops out of Egypt and other provinces wrote in his favor. Now\r\nin the first place, your letters against him contradict each other, and\r\nthe second have no sort of agreement with the first, but in many instances\r\nthe former are refuted by the latter, and the latter are impeached by the\r\nformer.…\r\n\r\n§ 29. Now when these things were thus represented, and so many witnesses\r\nappeared in his behalf, and so much advanced by him in his own\r\njustification, what did it become us to do? Or what did the rule of the\r\nChurch require except that we should not condemn the man, but rather\r\nreceive him and hold him as a bishop as we have done.…\r\n\r\n§ 32. With respect to Marcellus, forasmuch as you have written concerning\r\nhim also as impious in respect to Christ, I am anxious to inform you that,\r\nwhen he was here, he positively declared that what you had written\r\nconcerning him was not true; but, being nevertheless requested by us to\r\ngive an account of his faith, he answered in his own person with the\r\nutmost boldness, so that we recognize that he maintains nothing outside of\r\nthe truth. He confessed that he piously held the same doctrine concerning\r\nour Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ as the Catholic Church holds; and he\r\naffirmed that he had held these opinions not merely now but for a very\r\nlong time since; as indeed our presbyters, who were at a former time at\r\nthe Council of Nicæa, testified to his orthodoxy, for he maintained both\r\nthen and now his opposition to the heresy of Arius; on which point it is\r\nright to admonish you, that none of you admit such heresy, but instead\r\nabominate it as alien from the wholesome doctrine. Since he professed\r\northodox opinions and offered testimony to his orthodoxy, what again ought\r\nwe in his case to have done except to treat him as a bishop, as we did,\r\nand not reject him from our communion?…\r\n\r\n§ 33. For not only the bishops Athanasius and Marcellus and their fellows\r\ncame here and complained of the injustice that had been done them, but\r\nmany other bishops, also, from Thrace, from Cœle-Syria, from Phœnicia, and\r\nPalestine; and presbyters, not a few, and others from Alexandria and from\r\nother parts were present at the council here and, in addition to their own\r\nstatements, lamented bitterly before all the assembled bishops the\r\nviolence and injustice which the churches had suffered; and they affirmed\r\nthat outrages similar to those which had been committed in Alexandria had\r\noccurred not in word only but in deed in their own churches and in others\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Second Creed of Antioch_, A. D. 341, in Athanasius, _De Synodis\r\nArimini et Seleuciæ_, ch. 23. (MSG, 26:721.) Also in Socrates, _Hist.\r\nEc._, II, 10. (MSG, 67:201.) _Cf._ Hahn, § 154.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Council of Antioch in 341 was gathered ostensibly to dedicate\r\n    the great church of that city, in reality to act against the\r\n    Nicene party. It was attended by ninety or more bishops of whom\r\n    thirty-six were Arians. The others seem to have been chiefly\r\n    members of the middle party. The dogmatic definitions of this\r\n    council have never been accepted by the Church; on the other hand,\r\n    the canons on discipline have always enjoyed a very high place in\r\n    the esteem of later generations. The following creed, the second\r\n    of the Antiochian creeds, is traditionally regarded as having been\r\n    composed originally by Lucian of Antioch, the master of Arius.\r\n    Hence it is known as the creed of Lucian.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe in accordance with evangelic and apostolic tradition in one God\r\nthe Father Almighty, the creator, the maker and provider of all things.\r\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, God, through whom are\r\nall things, who was begotten of His Father before all ages, God of God,\r\nwhole of whole, only one of only one, perfect of perfect, king of king,\r\nlord of lord, the living word, living wisdom, true light, way, truth,\r\nresurrection, shepherd, door, unchangeable, unalterable, and immutable,\r\nthe unchangeable likeness of the Godhead, both of the substance, and will\r\nand power and glory of the Father, the first-born of all creation, who was\r\nin the beginning with God, God Logos, according to what is said in the\r\nGospel: “and the word was God,” through whom all things were made, and “in\r\nwhom all things consist,” who in the last days came down from above, and\r\nwas born of a virgin, according to the Scriptures, and became man, the\r\nmediator between God and man, and the apostle of our faith, and the prince\r\nof life; as He says, “I have come down from heaven, not to do mine own\r\nwill, but the will of Him that sent me”; who suffered for us, and rose the\r\nthird day and ascended into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of the\r\nFather, and comes again with glory and power to judge the living and the\r\ndead. And in the Holy Spirit given for consolation and sanctification and\r\nperfection to those who believe; as also our Lord Jesus Christ commanded\r\nhis disciples, saying, “Go ye, teach all nations, baptizing them in the\r\nname of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,” clearly of the\r\nFather who is really a Father, and of the Son who is really a Son, and of\r\nthe Holy Spirit who is really a Holy Spirit; these names being assigned\r\nnot vaguely nor idly, but indicating accurately the special subsistence\r\n[hypostasis], order, glory of those named, so that in subsistence they are\r\nthree, but in harmony one.\r\n\r\nHaving then this faith from the beginning and holding it to the end,\r\nbefore God and Christ we anathematize all heretical false doctrines. And\r\nif any one contrary to the right faith of the Holy Scriptures, teaches and\r\nsays that there has been a time, a season, or age, or being or becoming,\r\nbefore the Son of God was begotten, let him be accursed. And if any one\r\nsays that the Son is a creature as one of the creatures, or generated as\r\none of the things generated, or made as one of the things made, and not as\r\nthe divine Scriptures have handed down each of the forenamed statements;\r\nor if a man teaches or preaches anything else contrary to what we have\r\nreceived, let him be accursed. For we truly and clearly both believe and\r\nfollow all things from the Holy Scriptures that have been transmitted to\r\nus by the prophets and Apostles.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Fourth Creed of Antioch_, Socrates, _Hist._ Ec., II, 18. (MSG,\r\n67:221.) _Cf._ Hahn, § 156.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This creed is an approximation to the Nicene creed but without the\r\n    use of the word of especial importance, homoousios. Valuable\r\n    critical notes on the text of this and the preceding creed are to\r\n    be found in Hahn; as these creeds are to be found both in the work\r\n    of Athanasius on the councils of synods of Ariminum and Seleucia,\r\n    in the ecclesiastical history of Socrates and elsewhere, there is\r\n    a variety of readings, but of minor significance so far as the\r\n    essential features are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe in one God, Father Almighty, the creator and maker of all\r\nthings, of whom the whole family in heaven and upon earth is named; and in\r\nhis only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was begotten of the\r\nFather before all ages; God of God, light of light, through whom all\r\nthings in the heavens and upon earth, both visible and invisible were\r\nmade: who is the word, and wisdom, and power, and life, and true light:\r\nwho in the last days for our sake was made [became] man, and was born of\r\nthe holy Virgin; was crucified, and died; was buried, arose again from the\r\ndead on the third day, and ascended into heaven, is seated at the right\r\nhand of the Father, and is coming at the consummation of the age to judge\r\nthe living and the dead, and to render to each according to his works:\r\nwhose kingdom, being perpetual, shall continue to infinite ages (for He\r\nshall sit at the right hand of the Father, not only in this age, but also\r\nin that which is to come). And in the Holy Spirit; that is, in the\r\ncomforter, whom the Lord, according to His promise, sent to His Apostles\r\nafter His ascension into the heavens, to teach and bring all things to\r\ntheir remembrance: by whom, also, the souls of those who have sincerely\r\nbelieved in Him shall be sanctified; and those who assert that the Son was\r\nmade of things which are not, or of another subsistence [hypostasis], and\r\nnot of God, or that there was a time or age when He did not exist the holy\r\nCatholic Church accounts as aliens.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 66. Collapse of the Anti-Nicene Middle Party; the Renewal of Arianism;\r\nthe Rise of the Homoousian Party\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Constantius became sole Emperor, on the death of his brother Constans\r\nin 350, there was no further need of considering the interests of the\r\nNicene party. Only the necessity of establishing his authority in the West\r\nagainst usurpers engaged his attention until 356, when a series of\r\ncouncils began, designed to put an end to the Nicene faith. Of the\r\nnumerous confessions of faith put forth, the second creed of Sirmium of\r\n357 is important as attempting to abolish in connection with the\r\ndiscussion the use of the term _ousia_ and likewise _homoousios_ and\r\n_homoiousios_ (_a_). At Nice in Thrace a still greater departure from\r\nNicæa was attempted in 359, and a creed was put forth (_b_), which is of\r\nspecial significance as containing the first reference in a creed to the\r\n_descensus ad inferos_ and to the fact that it was subscribed by the\r\ndeputies of the West including Bishop Liberius of Rome. For the discussion\r\nof this act of Liberius, see J. Barmby, art. “Liberius” in DCB; see also\r\n_Catholic Encyclopædia_, art. “Liberius.” It was also received in the\r\nsynod of Seleucia in the East. On these councils see Athanasius, _De\r\nSynodis_ (PNF). It was in reference to this acceptance of the creed of\r\nNice that Jerome wrote “The whole world groaned and was astonished that it\r\nwas Arian.” See Jerome, _Contra Luciferianos_, §§ 18 _ff._ (PNF. ser. II,\r\nvol. VI).\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the anti-Nicene opposition party was a coalition of all\r\nparties opposed to the wording of the Nicene creed, as soon as that creed\r\nwas abolished the bond that held them together was broken. At once there\r\narose an extreme Arianism which had remained in the background. On the\r\nother hand, those who were opposed to Arianism sought to draw nearer the\r\nNicene party. These were the Homoiousians, who objected to the term\r\nhomoousios as savoring of Sabellianism, and yet admitted the essential\r\npoint implied by it. That this was so was pointed out by Hilary of\r\nPoitiers (_c_) who contended that what the West meant by homoousios the\r\nEast meant by homoiousios. The Homoiousian party of the East split on the\r\nquestion of the deity of the Holy Spirit. Those of them who denied the\r\ndeity of the Spirit remained Semi-Arians.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Second Creed of Sirmium_, in Hilary of Poitiers, _De Synodis_, ch.\r\n11. (MSL, 10:487.) _Cf._ Hahn, § 161.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Council of Sirmium in 357 was the second in that city. It was\r\n    attended entirely by bishops from the West. But among them were\r\n    Ursacius, Valens, and Germinius, leaders of the opposition to the\r\n    Nicene creed. Hosius under compulsion signed the following; see\r\n    Hilary, _loc cit._ The Latin original is given by Hilary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident that there is one God, the Father Almighty, according as it\r\nis believed throughout the whole world; and His only Son Jesus Christ our\r\nSaviour, begotten of Him before the ages. But we cannot and ought not to\r\nsay there are two Gods.…\r\n\r\nBut since some or many persons were disturbed by questions as to\r\nsubstance, called in Greek _ousia_, that is, to make it understood more\r\nexactly, as to _homoousios_ or what is called _homoiousios_, there ought\r\nto be no mention of these at all, nor ought any one to state them; for the\r\nreason and consideration that they are not contained in the divine\r\nScriptures, and that they are above man’s understanding, nor can any man\r\ndeclare the birth of the Son, of whom it is written: “Who shall declare\r\nHis generation?” For it is plain that only the Father knows how He begat\r\nthe Son, and the Son how He was begotten of the Father. There is no\r\nquestion that the Father is greater. No one can doubt that the Father is\r\ngreater than the Son, in honor, dignity, splendor, majesty and in the very\r\nname Father, the Son himself testifying, He that sent Me is greater than\r\nI. And no one is ignorant that it is Catholic doctrine that there are two\r\npersons of Father and Son; and that the Father is greater, and that the\r\nSon is subordinated to the Father, together with all things which the\r\nFather hath subordinated to Him; and that the Father has no beginning and\r\nis invisible, immortal, and impassible, but that the Son has been begotten\r\nof the Father, God of God, light of light, and of this Son the generation,\r\nas is aforesaid, no one knows but His Father. And that the Son of God\r\nhimself, our Lord and God, as we read, took flesh or a body, that is, man\r\nof the womb of the Virgin Mary, as the angel announced. And as all the\r\nScriptures teach, and especially the doctor of the Gentiles himself. He\r\ntook of Mary the Virgin, man, through whom He suffered. And the whole\r\nfaith is summed up and secured in this, that the Trinity must always be\r\npreserved, as we read in the Gospel: “Go ye and baptize all nations in the\r\nname of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Complete and\r\nperfect is the number of the Trinity. Now the Paraclete, or the Spirit, is\r\nthrough the Son: who was sent and came according to His promise in order\r\nto instruct, teach, and sanctify the Apostles and all believers.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Creed of Nice_ A. D. 359, Theodoret, _Hist. Ec._, II, 16. (MSG,\r\n82:1049.) _Cf._ Hahn, § 164.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The deputies from the Council of Ariminum were sent to Nice, a\r\n    small town in Thrace, where they met the heads of the Arian party.\r\n    A creed, strongly Arian in tendency, was given them and they were\r\n    sent back to Ariminum to have it accepted. See Theodoret, _loc.\r\n    cit._, and Athanasius, _De Synodis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe in one and only true God, Father Almighty, of whom are all\r\nthings. And in the only begotten Son of God, who before all ages and\r\nbefore every beginning was begotten of God, through whom all things were\r\nmade, both visible and invisible; begotten, only begotten, alone of the\r\nFather alone, God of God, like the Father that begat Him, according to the\r\nScriptures, whose generation no one knoweth except only the Father that\r\nbegat Him. This only begotten Son of God, sent by His Father, we know to\r\nhave come down from heaven, as it is written, for the destruction of sin\r\nand death; begotten of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary, as it is\r\nwritten, according to the flesh. Who companied with His disciples, and\r\nwhen the whole dispensation was fulfilled, according to the Father’s will,\r\nwas crucified, dead and buried, and descended to the world below, at whom\r\nhell itself trembled; on the third day He rose from the dead and companied\r\nwith His disciples, and when forty days were completed He was taken up\r\ninto the heavens, and sitteth on the right hand of His Father, and is\r\ncoming at the last day of the resurrection, in His Father’s glory, to\r\nrender to every one according to his works. And in the Holy Ghost, which\r\nthe only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ, both God and Lord, promised to\r\nsend to the race of men, the comforter, as it is written, the spirit of\r\ntruth, and this Spirit He himself sent after He had ascended into the\r\nheavens and sat at the right hand of the Father, from thence He is coming\r\nto judge both the quick and the dead.\r\n\r\nBut the word “substance,” which was simply inserted by the Fathers and not\r\nbeing understood was a cause of scandal to the people because it was not\r\nfound in the Scriptures, it hath seemed good to us to remove, and that for\r\nthe future no mention whatever be permitted of “substance,” because the\r\nsacred Scriptures nowhere make any mention of the “substance” of the\r\nFather and the Son. Nor must one “subsistence” [hypostasis] be named in\r\nrelation to the person [prosopon] of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And we\r\ncall the Son like the Father, as the Holy Scriptures call Him and teach.\r\nBut all heresies, both those already condemned, and any, if such there be,\r\nwhich have arisen against the document thus put forth, let them be\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Hilary of Poitiers. _De Synodis_, §§ 88, 89, 91. (MSL, 10:540.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    That the Homoiousian party meant substantially the same by their\r\n    term homoiousios as did the Homoousians or the Nicene party, by\r\n    their term homoousios.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hilary was of great importance in the Arian controversy in\r\n    bringing the Homoiousian party of the East and the Nicene party of\r\n    the West to an agreement. The Eastern theologians, who hesitated\r\n    to accept the Nicene term, were eventually induced to accept,\r\n    understanding by the term homoousios the same as homoiousios. See\r\n    below, § 70.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 88. Holy brethren, I understand by homoousios God of God, not of an\r\nunlike essence, not divided, but born; and that the Son has a birth that\r\nis unique, of the substance of the unknown God, that He is begotten yet\r\nco-eternal and wholly like the Father. The word homoousios greatly helped\r\nme already believing this. Why do you condemn my faith in the homoousios,\r\nwhich you cannot disapprove by the confession of the homoiousios? For you\r\ncondemn my faith, or rather your own, when you condemn its verbal\r\nequivalent. Does somebody else misunderstand it? Let us together condemn\r\nthe misunderstanding, but not take away the security of your faith. Do you\r\nthink that one must subscribe to the Samosetene Council, so that no one\r\nmay make use of homoousios in the sense of Paul of Samosata? Then let us\r\nsubscribe to the Council of Nicæa, so that the Arians may not impugn the\r\nword homoousios. Have we to fear that homoiousios does not imply the same\r\nbelief as homoousios? Let us decree that there is no difference between\r\nbeing of one and being of a similar substance. But may not the word\r\nhomoousios be understood in a wrong sense? Let it be proved that it can be\r\nunderstood in a good sense. We hold one and the same sacred truth. I\r\nbeseech you that the one and the same truth which we hold, we should\r\nregard as sacred among us. Forgive me, brethren, as I have so often asked\r\nyou to do. You are not Arians; why, then, by denying the homoousios,\r\nshould you be thought to be Arians?\r\n\r\n§ 89. … True likeness belongs to a true natural connection. But when the\r\ntrue natural connection exists, the homoousios is implied. It is likeness\r\naccording to essence when one piece of metal is like another and not\r\nplated.… Nothing can be like gold but gold, or like milk that does not\r\nbelong to that species.\r\n\r\n§ 91. I do not know the word homoousios or understand it unless it\r\nconfesses a similarity of essence. I call God of heaven and earth to\r\nwitness, that when I heard neither word, my belief was always such that I\r\nshould have interpreted homoiousios by homoousios. That is I believed that\r\nnothing could be similar according to nature unless it was of the same\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 67. The Policy of the Sons of Constantine Toward Heathenism and Donatism\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the sons of Constantine a harsher policy toward heathenism was\r\nadopted. Laws were passed forbidding heathen sacrifices (_a__, __b_), and\r\nalthough these were not carried out vigorously in the West, where there\r\nwere many heathen members of the leading families, they were more\r\ngenerally enforced in the East, and heathenism was thereby much reduced,\r\nat least in outward manifestations. As to heresy, the action of the\r\nemperors and especially Constantius in his constant endeavor to set aside\r\nthe Nicene faith involved harsh measures against all who differed from the\r\napproved theology of the court. Donatism called for special treatment. A\r\npolicy of conciliation was attempted, but on account of the failure to win\r\nover the Donatists and their alliance with fierce revolutionary fanatics,\r\nthe Circumcellions, violent measures were taken against them which nearly\r\nextirpated the sect.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 10, 2; A. D. 341.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This edict of Constantius is of importance here as it seems to\r\n    imply that Constantine did more toward repressing heathen\r\n    sacrifices than to forbid those celebrated in private. It is,\r\n    however, the only evidence of his prohibiting sacrifice, and it\r\n    might have been due to misunderstanding that his example is here\r\n    cited.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet superstition cease; let the madness of sacrifices be abolished. For\r\nwhoever, against the law of the divine prince, our parent [Constantine]\r\nand this command of our clemency, shall celebrate sacrifices, let a\r\npunishment appropriate to him and this present decision be issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 10, 3; A. D. 342.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the West Constans did not enforce the law against sacrifices\r\n    with great severity, but tolerated the existence and even use of\r\n    certain temples without the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough all superstition is to be entirely destroyed, yet we will that\r\nthe temple buildings, which are situated without the walls, remain intact\r\nand uninjured. For since from some have arisen various sports, races, and\r\ncontests, it is not proper that they should be destroyed, from which the\r\nsolemnity of ancient enjoyments are furnished to the Roman people.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 10, 4; A. D. 346.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is our pleasure that in all places and in all cities the temples be\r\nhenceforth closed, and access having been forbidden to all, freedom to sin\r\nbe denied the wicked. We will that all abstain from sacrifices; that if\r\nany one should commit any such act, let him fall before the vengeance of\r\nthe sword. Their goods, we decree, shall be taken away entirely and\r\nrecovered to the fisc, and likewise rectors of provinces are to be\r\npunished if they neglect to punish for these crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Optatus, _De schismate Donatistarum_, III, §§ 3, 4. (MSL, 11:999.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The principal historical writer treating the schism of the\r\n    Donatists is Optatus, Bishop of Mileve. His work on this sect was\r\n    written about 370 and revised and enlarged in 385. It is of\r\n    primary importance not merely for the history but for the dogmatic\r\n    discussions on the doctrine of the Church, Bk. II, the doctrine of\r\n    the sacraments, the idea of _opus operatum_ as applied to them,\r\n    Bk. V; in all of which he laid the foundation upon which Augustine\r\n    built. In addition to the passage from Optatus given here,\r\n    Epistles 88 and 185 by Augustine are accessible in translations\r\n    and will be found of assistance in filling in the account of the\r\n    Circumcellions. The latter is known as _De correctione\r\n    Donatistarum_ and is published in the anti-Donatist writings of\r\n    Augustine in PNF, ser. I, vol. IV; the most important passages are\r\n    §§ 15 and 25. It is probable that the party of the Circumcellions\r\n    was originally due to a revolt against intolerable agrarian\r\n    conditions and that their association with the Donatists was at\r\n    first slight.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. … The Emperor Constans did not send Paulus and Macarius primarily to\r\nbring about unity, but with alms, that, assisted by them, the poor of the\r\nvarious churches might be relieved, clothed, and fed. When they came to\r\nDonatus, your father, and showed him why they had come, he was seized with\r\nhis accustomed furious anger and broke forth with these words: “What has\r\nthe Emperor to do with the Church.”…\r\n\r\n§ 4. If anything, therefore, has been done harshly in bringing about\r\nunity,(106) you see, brother Parmenianus, to whom it ought to be\r\nattributed. Do you say that the military was sought by us Catholics; if\r\nso, then why did no one see the military in arms in the proconsular\r\nprovince? Paulus and Macarius came, everywhere to consider the poor and to\r\nexhort individuals to unity; and when they approached Bagaja, then another\r\nDonatus, bishop of that city, desiring to place an obstacle in the way of\r\nunity and hinder the work of those coming, whom we have mentioned, sent\r\nmessengers throughout the neighboring places and all markets, and summoned\r\nthe Circumcellions, calling them Agonistici, to come to the said place.\r\nAnd at that time the gathering of these was desired, whose madness a\r\nlittle before had been seen by the bishops themselves to have been\r\nimpiously inspired. For when men of this sort before the unity(107)\r\nwandered through various places, when Axido and Fasir were called by the\r\nsame mad ones the leaders of the saints, no one could be secure in his\r\npossessions; written evidences of indebtedness lost their force; no\r\ncreditor was at liberty at that time to demand anything. All were\r\nterrified by the letters of those who boasted that they were the leaders\r\nof the saints, and if there was any delay in fulfilling their commands,\r\nsuddenly a furious multitude hurried up and, terror going on before,\r\ncreditors were surrounded with a wall of dangers, so that those who ought\r\nto have been asked for their protection were by fear of death compelled to\r\nuse humble prayers. Each one hastened to abandon his most important\r\nduties; and profit was thought to have come from these outrages. Even the\r\nroads were no longer at all safe, because masters, turned out of their\r\ncarriages, ran humbly before their slaves sitting in the places of their\r\nmasters. By the judgment and rule of these the order of rank between\r\nmasters and servants was changed. Therefore when there arose complaint\r\nagainst the bishops of your party, they are said to have written to Count\r\nTaurinus, that such men could not be corrected in the Church, and they\r\ndemanded that they should receive discipline from the said count. Then\r\nTaurinus, in response to their letters, commanded an armed body of\r\nsoldiers to go through the markets where the Circumcellions were\r\naccustomed to wander. In Octavum very many were killed, many were beheaded\r\nand their bodies, even to the present day, can be counted by the white\r\naltars or tables.(108) When first some of their number were buried in the\r\nbasilicas, Clarus, a presbyter in Subbulum, was compelled by his bishop to\r\ndisinter those buried. Whence it is reported that what was done had been\r\ncommanded to be done, when it is admitted that sepulture in the house of\r\nGod is not granted. Afterward the multitude of these people increased. In\r\nthis way Donatus of Bagaja found whence he might lead against Macarius a\r\nraging mob. Of that sort were those who were to their own ruin murderers\r\nof themselves in their desire for a false martyrdom. Of these, also, were\r\nthose who rushed headlong and threw themselves down from the summits of\r\nlofty mountains. Behold from what numbers the second Bishop Donatus formed\r\nhis cohorts! Those who were bearing treasure which they had obtained for\r\nthe poor were held back by fear. They decided in so great a predicament to\r\ndemand from Count Sylvester armed soldiery, not that by these they should\r\ndo violence to any one, but that they might stop the force drawn up by the\r\naforesaid Bishop Donatus. Thus it happened that an armed soldiery was\r\nseen. Now, as to what followed, see to whom it ought or can be ascribed.\r\nThey had there an infinite number of those summoned, and it is certain\r\nthat a supply of provisions for a year had been provided. Of the basilicas\r\nthey made a sort of public granary, and awaited the coming of those\r\nagainst whom they might expend their fury, if the presence of armed\r\nsoldiery had not prevented them. For when, before the soldiers came, the\r\nmetatores,(109) as was the custom, were sent, they were not properly\r\nreceived, contrary to the apostolic precept, “honor to whom honor, custom\r\nto whom custom, tribute to whom tribute, owe no man anything.” For those\r\nwho had been sent with their horses were smitten by those whose names you\r\nhave made public with malicious intent. They were the authors of their own\r\nwrong; and what they could suffer they themselves taught by these\r\noutrages. The soldiers who had been maltreated returned to their fellows,\r\nand for what two or three suffered, all grieved. All were roused, and\r\ntheir officers could not restrain the angered soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 68. Julian the Apostate\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reign of Julian the Apostate (361-363) is important in the history of\r\nthe Christian Church, in the first place, as indicating the slight hold\r\nwhich heathenism had retained as a system upon the bulk of the people and\r\nthe impossibility of reviving it in any form in which it might compete\r\nwith the Church. Julian attempted to inject into a purified heathenism\r\nthose elements in the Christian Church which he was forced to admire. The\r\nresult was a fantastic mixture of rites and measures with which the\r\nheathen would have nothing to do. In the second place, in the development\r\nof the Church’s doctrinal system, and especially in the Arian controversy,\r\nthe reign of Julian gave the contestants, who were obliged to stand\r\ntogether against a common enemy, reason for examining in a new way the\r\npoints they had in common, and enabled them to see that some at least\r\ndiffered more over the expression than over the content of their faith.\r\nThe character of Julian has long been a favorite subject of study and\r\nespecially the motives that induced him to abandon Christianity for the\r\nNeo-Platonic revival of heathenism.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, III: Ammianus\r\n    Marcellinus, _Roman History_, XVI-XXV, translated by C. D. Yonge\r\n    (Bohn’s Classical Library); _Select Works of Julian_, translated\r\n    by C. W. King (Bohn).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Socrates. _Hist Ec._ III. 1. (MSG, 67:368.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Emperor Julian.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The account of the Emperor Julian as given by Socrates is probably\r\n    the best we have. It is, on the whole, a model of a fair\r\n    statement, such as is characteristic of the history of Socrates in\r\n    nearly all its parts. In spite of its length it is worthy of a\r\n    place in its entirety, as it explains the antecedents of a\r\n    character which the world has had difficulty in understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nConstantine, who gave Byzantium his own name, had two brothers born of the\r\nsame father but by a different mother, of these one was named Dalmatius,\r\nthe other Constantius. Dalmatius had a son of the same name as his own;\r\nConstantius had two sons, Gallus and Julian. Now, as on the death of\r\nConstantine, the founder of Constantinople, the soldiery had put the\r\nyounger brother Constantius to death, the lives of his two orphaned\r\nchildren were also endangered; but a disease, apparently fatal, preserved\r\nGallus from the violence of his father’s murderers; and as to Julian, his\r\nage—for he was only eight years old at the time—protected him. The\r\nEmperor’s jealousy toward them having been subdued, Gallus attended\r\nschools at Ephesus in Ionia, in which country considerable possessions had\r\nbeen left them by their parents. Julian, however, when he was grown up\r\npursued his studies at Constantinople, going constantly to the palace,\r\nwhere the schools then were, in simple attire and under the care of the\r\neunuch Mardonius. In grammar, Nicocles, the Lacedæmonian, was his\r\ninstructor; and Ecbolius, the sophist, who was at that time a Christian,\r\ntaught him rhetoric; for the Emperor Constantius had made provision that\r\nhe should have no pagan masters, lest he should be seduced to pagan\r\nsuperstitions; for Julian was a Christian at the beginning. Since he made\r\ngreat progress in literature, the report began to spread that he was\r\ncapable of ruling the Roman Empire; and this popular rumor becoming\r\ngenerally spread abroad, greatly disquieted the Emperor. Therefore he\r\nremoved him from the great city to Nicomedia, forbidding him at the same\r\ntime to frequent the school of Libanius the Syrian sophist. For Libanius,\r\nhaving been driven away by the teachers of Constantinople, had opened a\r\nschool at Nicomedia. Here he gave vent to his indignation against the\r\nteachers in his treatise composed against them. Julian, however, was\r\ninterdicted from being his auditor, because Libanius was a pagan in\r\nreligion; nevertheless because he admired his orations, he procured them\r\nand read them secretly and diligently. As he was becoming very expert in\r\nthe rhetorical art, Maximus the philosopher arrived in Nicomedia, not the\r\nByzantine, Euclid’s father, but the Ephesian whom the Emperor Valentinian\r\nafterward caused to be executed as a practicer of magic. This took place\r\nlater; at that time the only thing that attracted him to Nicomedia was the\r\nfame of Julian. Having obtained from him a taste for the principles of\r\nphilosophy, Julian began to imitate the religion of his teacher, who had\r\ninstilled into his mind a desire for the Empire. When these things reached\r\nthe ears of the Emperor, wavering between hope and fear, Julian became\r\nvery anxious to lull the suspicion that had been awakened, and he who was\r\nat first truly a Christian then became one in pretence. Shaved to the very\r\nskin, he pretended to live the monastic life; and while in private he\r\npursued philosophical studies, in public he read the sacred writings of\r\nthe Christian Church. Moreover, he was appointed reader of the church in\r\nNicomedia. Thus by these pretexts he escaped the Emperor’s displeasure.\r\nNow he did all this from fear, but he by no means abandoned his hope;\r\ntelling many of his friends that times would be happier when he should\r\npossess all. While his affairs were in this condition his brother Gallus,\r\nwho had been created Cæsar, when he was on his way to the East came to\r\nNicomedia to see him. But when Gallus was slain shortly after, Julian was\r\nimmediately suspected by the Emperor; therefore the latter directed that\r\nhe should be kept under guard; he soon found means, however, of escaping\r\nfrom his guards, and fleeing from place to place he managed to be in\r\nsafety. At last Eusebia, the wife of the Emperor, having discovered him in\r\nhis retreat, persuaded the Emperor to do him no harm, and to permit him to\r\ngo to Athens to study philosophy. From thence—to be brief—the Emperor\r\nrecalled him and afterward created him Cæsar, and having given him his own\r\nsister Helen in marriage, he sent him to Gaul against the barbarians. For\r\nthe barbarians whom the Emperor Constantius had hired as auxiliary forces\r\nagainst Magnentius, being of no use against that usurper, were pillaging\r\nthe Roman cities. Inasmuch as he was young he ordered him to undertake\r\nnothing without consulting the other military chiefs.… Julian’s complaint\r\nto the Emperor of the inertness of his military officers procured for him\r\na coadjutor in the command more in sympathy with his ardor; and by their\r\ncombined efforts an assault was made upon the barbarians. But they sent\r\nhim an embassy, assuring him that they had been ordered by letters of the\r\nEmperor to march into Roman territories, and they showed him the letters.\r\nBut he cast the ambassadors into prison, vigorously attacked the forces of\r\nthe enemy and totally defeated them; and having taken their king prisoner,\r\nhe sent him to Constantius. After these successes he was proclaimed\r\nEmperor by the soldiers; and inasmuch as there was no imperial crown at\r\nhand, one of the guards took the chain which he wore around his own neck\r\nand placed it upon Julian’s head. Thus Julian became Emperor; but whether\r\nhe subsequently conducted himself as a philosopher, let my readers\r\ndetermine. For he neither sent an embassy to Constantius, nor paid him the\r\nleast homage in acknowledgment of past favors; but conducted everything\r\njust as it pleased him. He changed the rulers of the provinces, and he\r\nsought to bring Constantius into contempt by reciting publicly in every\r\ncity the letters which Constantius had written to the barbarians. For this\r\nreason the cities revolted from Constantius and attached themselves to\r\nhim. Then he openly put off the pretence of being a Christian; going about\r\nto the various cities, he opened the pagan temples, offering sacrifices to\r\nthe idols, and designating himself “Pontifex Maximus”; and the heathen\r\ncelebrated their pagan festivals with pagan rites. By doing these things\r\nhe excited a civil war against Constantius; and thus as far as he was\r\nconcerned all the evils involved in war happened. For this philosopher’s\r\ndesire could not have been fulfilled without much bloodshed. But God, who\r\nis the judge of His own counsels, checked the fury of these antagonists\r\nwithout detriment to the State by the removal of one of them. For when\r\nJulian arrived among the Thracians, it was announced that Constantius was\r\ndead. And thus did the Roman Empire at that time escape the intestine\r\nstrife. Julian entered Constantinople and at once considered how he might\r\nconciliate the masses and secure popular favor. Accordingly, he had\r\nrecourse to the following measures: he knew that Constantius was hated by\r\nall the people who held the homoousian faith and had driven them from the\r\nchurches and had proscribed and exiled their bishops. He was aware, also,\r\nthat the pagans were extremely discontented because they had been\r\nforbidden to sacrifice to their gods, and were anxious to get their\r\ntemples opened and to be at liberty to offer sacrifices to their idols.\r\nThus he knew that both classes secretly entertained hostile feelings\r\ntoward his predecessor, and at the same time the people in general were\r\nexceedingly exasperated by the violence of the eunuchs, and especially by\r\nthe rapacity of Eusebius, the chief officer of the imperial bed-chamber.\r\nTherefore he treated all with craftiness. With some he dissembled; others\r\nhe attached to himself by conferring obligations upon them, led by a\r\ndesire for vainglory; but to all he manifested how he stood toward the\r\nheathen religion. And first, in order to slander Constantius and condemn\r\nhim as cruel toward his subjects among the people generally, he recalled\r\nthe exiled bishops and restored to them their confiscated estates. He next\r\ncommanded suitable agents to open the pagan temples without delay. Then he\r\ndirected that those who had been treated unjustly by the eunuchs should\r\nreceive back the property of which they had been plundered. Eusebius, the\r\nchief officer of the imperial bed-chamber, he punished with death, not\r\nonly on account of the injuries he had inflicted on others, but because he\r\nwas assured that it was through his machinations his brother Gallus had\r\nbeen killed. The body of Constantius he honored with an imperial funeral,\r\nbut he expelled the eunuchs, the barbers, and cooks from the palace.… At\r\nnight, remaining awake, he wrote orations which he afterward delivered in\r\nthe Senate, going thither from the palace, though in fact he was the first\r\nand only Emperor since the time of Julius Cæsar who made speeches in that\r\nassembly. He honored those who were eminent for literary attainments, and\r\nespecially those who taught philosophy; in consequence of which an\r\nabundance of pretenders to learning of this sort resorted to the palace\r\nfrom all quarters, men who wore their palliums and were more conspicuous\r\nfor their costume than for their erudition. These impostors, who\r\ninvariably adopted the religious sentiments of their prince, were inimical\r\nto the welfare of the Christians; but since Julian himself was overcome by\r\nexcessive vanity he derided all his predecessors in a book which he wrote,\r\nentitled “The Cæsars.” Led by the same haughty disposition, he composed\r\ntreatises against the Christians as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Sozomenus, _Hist. Ec._, V, 3. (MSG, 67:1217.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Julian’s restoration of heathenism.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Julian was placed in sole possession of the Empire he commanded all\r\nthe temples throughout the East to be reopened; and he also commanded that\r\nthose which had been neglected to be repaired, those which had fallen into\r\nruins to be rebuilt, and the altars to be restored. He assigned\r\nconsiderable money for this purpose. He restored the customs of antiquity\r\nand the ancestral ceremonies in the cities and the sacrifices. He himself\r\noffered libations openly and sacrificed publicly; and held in honor those\r\nwho were zealous in these things. He restored to their ancient privileges\r\nthe initiators and the priests, the hierophants and the servants of the\r\ntemples, and confirmed the legislation of former emperors in their favor.\r\nHe granted them exemption from duties and other burdens as they had\r\npreviously had had such exemption. He restored to the temple guardians the\r\nprovisions which had been abolished. He commanded them to be pure from\r\nmeats, and to abstain from whatever, according to pagan opinion, was not\r\nbefitting him who had announced his purpose of leading a pure life.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Sozomenus, _Hist. Ec._, V, 5. (MSG, 67:1225.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Julian’s measures against the Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Among those who benefited by the recall of those who had been\r\n    banished for their religious beliefs were not only the orthodox\r\n    Christians who suffered under Constantius, but also the Donatists\r\n    and others who had been expelled from their homes by the previous\r\n    emperors.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulian recalled all who, during the reign of Constantius, had been\r\nbanished on account of their religious beliefs, and restored to them their\r\nproperty which had been confiscated by law. He charged the people not to\r\ncommit any act of injustice against any of the Christians, not to insult\r\nthem and not to constrain them to sacrifice unwillingly.… He deprived the\r\nclergy, however, of their immunities, honors, and provisions which\r\nConstantine had conferred, repealed the laws which had been enacted in\r\ntheir favor, and reinforced their statutory liabilities. He even compelled\r\nthe virgins and widows, who on account of their poverty were reckoned\r\namong the clergy, to refund the provision which had been assigned them\r\nfrom the public treasury.… In the intensity of his hatred of the faith, he\r\nseized every opportunity to ruin the Church. He deprived it of its\r\nproperty, votive offerings, and sacred vessels, and condemned those who\r\nhad demolished temples during the reign of Constantine and Constantius to\r\nrebuild them or to defray the expense of re-erection. On this ground,\r\nsince they were unable to repay the sum and also on account of the search\r\nafter sacred money, many of the priests, clergy, and other Christians were\r\ncruelly tortured and cast into prison.… He recalled the priests who had\r\nbeen banished by the Emperor Constantius; but it is said that he issued\r\nthis order in their behalf, not out of mercy, but that through contention\r\namong themselves the churches might be involved in fraternal strife and\r\nmight fall away from their law, or because he wished to asperse the memory\r\nof Constantius.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Julian, _Ep._ 49, _ad Arsacium_; Julian, Imp., _Epistulæ_, ed.\r\nHertlein.

Hellenism(110) does not flourish as\r\nwe would have it, because of its votaries. The worship of the gods,\r\nhowever, is grand and magnificent beyond all our prayers and hopes. Let\r\nour Adrastea be propitious to these words. No one a little while ago could\r\nhave dared to look for such and so great a change in a short time. But do\r\nwe think that these things are enough, and not rather consider that\r\nhumanity shown strangers, the reverent diligence shown in burying the\r\ndead, and the false holiness as to their lives have principally advanced\r\natheism?(111) Each of these things is needful, I think, to be faithfully\r\npractised among us. It is not sufficient that you alone should be such,\r\nbut in general all the priests, as many as there are throughout Galatia,\r\nwhom you must either shame or persuade to be zealous, or else deprive them\r\nof their priestly office, if they do not come with their wives, children,\r\nand servants to the temples of the gods, or if they support servants,\r\nsons, or wives who are impious toward the gods and prefer atheism to\r\npiety. Then exhort the priests not to frequent the theatres, not to drink\r\nin taverns, nor to practise any art or business which is shameful or\r\nmenial. Honor those who comply, expel those who disobey. Establish\r\nhostelries in every city, so that strangers, or whoever has need of money,\r\nmay enjoy our philanthropy, not merely those of our own, but also those of\r\nother religions. I have meanwhile made plans by which you will be able to\r\nmeet the expense. I have commanded that throughout the whole of Galatia\r\nannually thirty thousand bushels of corn and sixty thousand measures of\r\nwine be given, of which the fifth part I order to be devoted to the\r\nsupport of the poor who attend upon the priests; and the rest is to be\r\ndistributed by us among strangers and beggars. For if there is not one\r\namong the Jews who begs, and even the impious Galileans, in addition to\r\ntheir own, support also ours, it is shameful that our poor should be\r\nwanting our aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Sozomenus, _Hist. Ec._, V, 16. (MSG, 67:1260.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Measures taken by Julian for the restoration of heathenism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, who had long since been eager that Hellenism should prevail\r\nthrough the Empire, was bitterly grieved seeing it excelled by\r\nChristianity. The temples, however, were kept open; the sacrifices and the\r\nancient festivals appeared to him in all the cities to come from his will.\r\nHe grieved that when he considered that if they should be deprived of his\r\ncare they would experience a speedy change. He was particularly chagrined\r\non discovering that the wives, children, and servants of many pagan\r\npriests professed Christianity. On reflecting that the Christian religion\r\nhad a support in the life and behavior of those professing it, he\r\ndetermined to introduce into the pagan temples everywhere the order and\r\ndiscipline of the Christian religion: by orders and degrees of the\r\nministry, by teachers and readers to give instruction in pagan doctrines\r\nand exhortations, by appointed prayers on certain days and at stated\r\nhours, by monasteries both for men and for women who desired to live in\r\nphilosophical retirement, likewise hospitals for the relief of strangers\r\nand of the poor, and by other philanthropy toward the poor to glorify the\r\nHellenic doctrine. He commanded that a suitable correction be appointed by\r\nway of penance after the Christian tradition for voluntary and involuntary\r\ntransgressions. He is said to have admired especially the letters of\r\nrecommendation of the bishops by which they commended travellers to other\r\nbishops, so that coming from anywhere they might go to any one and be\r\nhospitably received as known and as friends, and be cared for kindly on\r\nthe evidence of these testimonials. Considering also these things, he\r\nendeavored to accustom the pagans to Christian practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Sozomenus. _Hist. Ec._, V, 18. (MSG, 67:1269.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Cf._ Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, III, 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulian forbade the children of Christians to be instructed in the writings\r\nof the Greek poets and authors, and to frequent the public schools.… He\r\ndid not permit Christians to be educated in the learning of the Greeks,\r\nsince he considered that only from them the power of persuasion was\r\ngained. Apollinaris,(112) therefore, at that time employed his great\r\nlearning and ingenuity in the production of a heroic epic on the\r\nantiquities of the Hebrews to the reign of Saul as a substitute for the\r\npoem of Homer.… He also wrote comedies in imitation of Menander, and\r\nimitated the tragedies of Euripides and the odes of Pindar.… Were it not\r\nthat men were accustomed to venerate antiquity and to love that to which\r\nthey are accustomed, the works of Apollinaris would be equally praised and\r\ntaught.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Julian, _Epistula_ 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Edict against Christian teachers of the classics.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is the famous decree prohibiting Christians from teaching the\r\n    Greek classics, and was quite generally understood by Christians\r\n    as preventing them from studying the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think true culture consists not in proficiency in words and speech, but\r\nin a condition of mind which has sound intentions and right opinions\r\nconcerning good and evil, the honorable and the base. Whoever, therefore,\r\nthinks one thing and teaches those about him another appears to be as\r\nwanting in culture as in honor. If in trifles there is a difference\r\nbetween thought and speech, it is nevertheless an evil in some way to be\r\nendured; but if in important matters any one thinks one thing and teaches\r\nin opposition to what he thinks, this is the trick of charlatans, the act\r\nnot of good men, but of those who are thoroughly depraved, especially in\r\nthe case of those who teach what they regard as most worthless, deceiving\r\nand enticing by flattery into evil those whom they wish to use for their\r\nown purposes. All those who undertake to teach anything should be upright\r\nin life and not cherish in their minds ideas which are in opposition to\r\nthose commonly received; most of all I think that such they ought to be\r\nwho converse with the young on learning, or who explain the writings of\r\nthe ancients, whether they are teachers of eloquence or of rhetoric, and\r\nstill more if they are sophists. For they aim to be not merely teachers of\r\nwords but of morals as well, and claim instruction in political science as\r\nbelonging to their field. Whether this be true, I will leave undetermined.\r\nBut praising them as those who thus strive for fine professions, I would\r\npraise them still more if they neither lied nor contradicted themselves,\r\nthinking one thing and teaching their pupils another. Homer, Hesiod,\r\nDemosthenes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Isocrates, and Lysias were indebted to\r\nthe gods for all their science. Did they not think that they were under\r\nthe protection of Hermes and of the Muses? It seems to me, therefore,\r\nabsurd that those who explain their writings should despise the gods they\r\nhonored. But when I think it is absurd, I do not say that, on account of\r\ntheir pupils, they should alter their opinions; but I give them the\r\nchoice, either not to teach what they do not hold as good, or, if they\r\nprefer to teach, first to convince their pupils that Homer, Hesiod, or any\r\nof those whom they explain and condemn, is not so godless and foolish in\r\nrespect to the gods as they represent him to be. For since they draw their\r\nsupport and make gain from what these have written, they confess\r\nthemselves most sordidly greedy of gain, willing to do anything for a few\r\ndrachmas. Hitherto there were many causes for the lack of attendance upon\r\nthe temples, and overhanging fear gave an excuse for keeping secret the\r\nright teaching concerning the gods. Now, however, since the gods have\r\ngranted us freedom, it seems to me absurd that men should teach what they\r\ndo not regard as good. If they believe that all those men are wise whose\r\nwritings they expound and as whose prophets they sit, let them first\r\nimitate their piety toward the gods; but if they think that these writers\r\nerred concerning the most honored gods, let them go into the churches of\r\nthe Galileans and expound Matthew and Luke, believing whom you forbid\r\nattendance upon the sacrifices. I would that your ears and tongues were\r\nborn again, as you would say, of those things in which I always take part,\r\nand whoever loves me thinks and does. This law is to apply to teachers and\r\ninstructors generally. Whoever among the youth wishes to make use of their\r\ninstruction is not forbidden. For it would not be fair in the case of\r\nthose who are yet youths and do not know which way to turn, to forbid the\r\nbest way, and through fear to compel them to remain unwillingly by their\r\nancestral institutions. Although it would be right to cure such people\r\nagainst their wills as being insane, yet it is permitted all to suffer\r\nunder this disease. For it is my opinion that the ignorant should be\r\ninstructed, not punished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. The Triumph Of The New Nicene Orthodoxy Over Heterodoxy And\r\nHeathenism\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arian controversy was the most important series of events in the\r\ninternal history of the Christian Church in the fourth century, without\r\nreference to the truth or error of the positions taken or the rightful\r\nplace of dogma within the Church. It roused more difficulties, problems,\r\nand disputes, led to more persecutions, ended in greater party triumphs\r\nthan any other ecclesiastical or religious movement. It entered upon its\r\nlast important phase about the time of the accession of the Emperor\r\nJulian. From that time the parties began to recognize their real\r\naffiliations and sought a basis of union in a common principle. The effect\r\nwas that on the accession of Christian emperors the Church was able to\r\nadvance rapidly toward a definitive statement. Of the emperors that\r\nfollowed Julian, Valentinian I (364-375), who ruled in the West, took a\r\nmoderate and tolerant position in the question regarding the existence of\r\nheathenism alongside of the Church and heretical parties within the\r\nChurch, though afterward harsher measures were taken by his son and\r\nsuccessor (§ 69). In the East his colleague Valens (364-378) supported the\r\nextreme Arian party and persecuted the other parties, at the same time\r\ntolerating heathenism. This only brought the anti-Arians more closely\r\ntogether as a new party on the basis of a new interpretation of the Nicene\r\nformula (§ 70, _cf._ § 66, _c_). On the death of Valens at Adrianople,\r\n378, an opportunity was given this new party, which it has become\r\ncustomary to call the New Nicene party, to support Theodosius (379-395) in\r\nhis work of putting through the orthodox formula at the Council of\r\nConstantinople, 381 (§ 71).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 69. The Emperors from Jovian to Theodosius and Their Policy toward\r\nHeathenism and Arianism\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reign of Jovian lasted so short a time, June, 363, to February, 364,\r\nthat he had no time to develop a policy, and the assertion of Theodoret\r\nthat he extinguished the heathen sacrificial fires is doubtful. On the\r\ndeath of Jovian, Valentinian was elected Emperor, who soon associated with\r\nhimself his brother Valens as his colleague for the East. The two were\r\ntolerant toward heathenism, but Valens took an active part in favor of\r\nArianism, while Valentinian held aloof from doctrinal controversy. On the\r\ndeath of Valentinian I, his sons Gratian (murdered at Lyons, 383) and\r\nValentinian II (murdered at Vienne by Arbogast, 392), succeeded to the\r\nEmpire. Under them the policy of toleration ceased, heathenism was\r\nproscribed. In the East under Theodosius, appointed colleague of Gratian\r\nin 379, the same policy was enforced. Arianism was now put down with a\r\nstrong hand in both parts of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Ammianus Marcellinus, _Roman History_, XXX, 9, § 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The religious policy of Valentinian I.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ammianus Marcellinus is probably the best of the later Roman\r\n    historians, and is the chief authority for much of the secular\r\n    history from 353 to 378, in which period he is a source of the\r\n    first rank, writing from personal observation and first-hand\r\n    information. Ammianus was himself a heathen, but he seems not to\r\n    have been embittered by the persecution to which his faith had\r\n    been subjected. He was a man of a calm and judicial mind, and his\r\n    judgment is rarely biassed, even when he touches upon\r\n    ecclesiastical matters which, however, he rarely does.\r\n\r\n\r\nValentinian was especially remarkable during his reign for his moderation\r\nin this particular—that he kept a middle course between the different\r\nsects of religion, and never troubled any one, nor issued any orders in\r\nfavor of one kind of worship rather than another; nor did he promulgate\r\nany threatening edicts to bow down the necks of his subjects to the form\r\nof worship to which he himself was inclined; but he left these parties\r\njust as he found them, without making any alterations.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XII, 1, 75; A. D. 371.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In this edict Valentinian I confirms the immunities of the heathen\r\n    priesthood which had been restored by Julian. The heathen\r\n    priesthood is here shown to continue as still open to aspirants\r\n    after political honors and conferring immunities upon those who\r\n    attained it. The curial had to pass through the various offices in\r\n    fixed order before he attained release from burdens which had been\r\n    laid upon him by the State’s system of taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet those be held as enjoying immunity who, advancing by the various\r\ngrades and in due order, have performed their various obligations and have\r\nattained by their labor and approved actions to the priesthood of a\r\nprovince or to the honor of a chief magistracy, gaining this position not\r\nby favor and votes obtained by begging for them, but with the favorable\r\nreport of the citizens and commendation of the public as a whole, and let\r\nthem enjoy the repose which they shall have deserved by their long labor,\r\nand let them not be subject to those acts of bodily severity in punishment\r\nwhich it is not seemly that _honorati_ should undergo.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Theodoret. _Hist. Ec._, IV, 21; V, 20. (MSG, 82:1181.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following statement of Theodoret might seem to have been\r\n    inspired by the general hatred which was felt for the violent\r\n    persecutor and pronounced Arian, Valens. Nevertheless the\r\n    statement is supported by references to the conditions under\r\n    Valens made by Libanius in his _Oratio pro Templis_, addressed to\r\n    the Emperor Theodosius.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV, 21. At Antioch Valens spent considerable time, and gave complete\r\nlicense to all who under cover of the Christian name, pagans, Jews, and\r\nthe rest preached doctrines contrary to those of the Gospel. The slaves of\r\nthis error even went so far as to perform pagan rites, and thus the\r\ndeceitful fire which after Julian had been quenched by Jovian, was now\r\nrekindled by permission of Valens. The rites of the Jews, of Dionysus and\r\nDemeter were no longer performed in a corner as they would have been in a\r\npious reign, but by revellers running wild in the forum. Valens was a foe\r\nto none but to them that held the apostolic doctrine.\r\n\r\nV, 20. Against the champions of the apostolic decrees alone he persisted\r\nin waging war. Accordingly, during the whole period of his reign the altar\r\nfire was lit, libations and sacrifices were offered to idols, public\r\nfeasts were celebrated in the forum, and votaries initiated in the orgies\r\nof Dionysus ran about in goatskins, mangling dogs in Bacchic frenzy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Symmachus, _Memorial to Valentinian II_; Ambrose, _Epistula_ 17.\r\n(MSL, 16:1007.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    A petition for the restoration of the altar of Victory in the\r\n    Senate House at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Symmachus, prefect of the city, had previously appealed to Gratian\r\n    to restore the altar which had been removed. The following\r\n    petition, of which the more impressive parts are given, was made\r\n    in 384, two years after the first petition. The opening paragraph\r\n    refers to the former petition. The memorial is found among the\r\n    Epistles of Ambrose, who replies to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. As soon as the most honorable Senate, always devoted to you, knew what\r\ncrimes were made amenable to law, and saw that the reputation of late\r\ntimes was being purified by pious princes, following the example of a\r\nfavorable time, it gave utterance to its long-suppressed grief and bade me\r\nbe once again the delegate to utter its complaints. But through wicked men\r\naudience was refused me by the divine Emperor, otherwise justice would not\r\nhave been wanting, my lords and emperors of great renown, Valentinian,\r\nTheodosius, and Arcadius, victorious, triumphant, and ever august.\r\n\r\n3. It is our task to watch on behalf of your clemency. For by what is it\r\nmore suitable that we defend the institutions of our ancestors, and the\r\nrights and destiny of our country, than by the glory of these times, which\r\nis all the greater when you understand that you may not do anything\r\ncontrary to the custom of your ancestors? We request, then, the\r\nrestoration of that condition of religious affairs which was so long of\r\nadvantage to the State. Let the rulers of each sect and of each opinion be\r\ncounted up; a late one [Julian] practised the ceremonies of his ancestors,\r\na later [Valentinian I], did not abolish them. If the religion of old\r\ntimes does not make a precedent, let the connivance of the last\r\n[Valentinian and Valens] do so.\r\n\r\n4. Who is so friendly with the barbarians as not to require an altar of\r\nVictory?…\r\n\r\n5. But even if the avoidance of such an omen(113) were not sufficient, it\r\nwould at least have been seemly to abstain from injuring the ornaments of\r\nthe Senate House. Allow us, we beseech you, as old men to leave to\r\nposterity what we received as boys. The love of custom is great. Justly\r\ndid the act of the divine Constantius last for a short time. All\r\nprecedents ought to be avoided by you, which you know were soon\r\nabolished.(114)\r\n\r\n6. Where shall we swear to obey your laws and commands? By what religious\r\nsanctions shall the false mind be terrified, so as not to lie in bearing\r\nwitness? All things are, indeed, filled with God, and no place is safe for\r\nthe perjured, but to be bound in the very presence of religious forms has\r\ngreat power in producing a fear of sinning. That altar preserves the\r\nconcord of all; that altar appeals to the good faith of each; and nothing\r\ngives more authority to our decrees than that our order issues every\r\ndecree as if we were under the sanction of an oath. So that a place will\r\nbe opened to perjury, and my illustrious princes, who are defended by a\r\npublic oath, will deem this to be such.\r\n\r\n7. But the divine Constantius is said to have done the same. Let us rather\r\nimitate the other actions of that prince [Valentinian I], who would have\r\nundertaken nothing of the kind, if any one else had committed such an\r\nerror before him. For the fall of the earlier sets his successor right,\r\nand amendment results from the censure of a previous example. It was\r\npardonable for your clemency’s ancestor in so novel a matter not to guard\r\nagainst blame. Can the same excuse avail us, if we imitate what we know to\r\nhave been disapproved?\r\n\r\n8. Will your majesties listen to other actions of this same prince, which\r\nyou may more worthily imitate? He diminished none of the privileges of the\r\nsacred virgins, he filled the priestly offices with nobles. He did not\r\nrefuse the cost of the Roman ceremonies, and following the rejoicing\r\nSenate through all the streets of the Eternal City, he beheld the shrines\r\nwith unmoved countenance, he read the names of the gods inscribed on the\r\npediments, he inquired about the origin of the temples, and expressed\r\nadmiration for their founders. Although he himself followed another\r\nreligion, he maintained these for the Empire, for every one has his own\r\ncustoms, every one his own rites. The divine Mind has distributed\r\ndifferent guardians and different cults to different cities. As souls are\r\nseparately given to infants as they are born, so to a people is given the\r\ngenius of its destiny. Here comes in the proof from advantage, which most\r\nof all vouches to man for the gods. For, since our reason is wholly\r\nclouded, whence does the knowledge of the gods more rightly come to us,\r\nthan from the memory and records of successful affairs? Now if a long\r\nperiod gives authority to religious customs, faith ought to be kept with\r\nso many centuries, and our ancestors ought to be followed by us as they\r\nhappily followed theirs.\r\n\r\n9. Let us now suppose that we are present at Rome and that she addresses\r\nyou in these words: “Excellent princes, fathers of your country, respect\r\nmy years to which pious rites have brought me. Let me use the ancestral\r\nceremonies, for I do not repent of them. Let me live after my own fashion,\r\nfor I am free. This worship subdued the world to my laws, these sacred\r\nrites repelled Hannibal from the walls, and the Senones from the capitol.\r\nHave I been reserved for this, that when aged I should be blamed? I will\r\nconsider what it is thought should be set in order, but tardy and\r\ndiscreditable is the reformation of old age.”\r\n\r\n10. We ask, therefore, peace for the gods of our fathers and of our\r\ncountry. It is just that what all worship be considered one. We look on\r\nthe same stars, the sky is common, the same world surrounds us. What\r\ndifference does it make by what paths each seeks the truth? We cannot\r\nattain to so great a secret by one road; but this discussion is rather for\r\npersons at ease; we offer now prayers, not conflict.(115)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Ambrose, _Epistula_ 18. (MSL, 16:1013.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Reply of Ambrose to the Memorial of Symmachus.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Immediately after the receipt of the Memorial of Symmachus by\r\n    Valentinian II, a copy was sent to Ambrose, who wrote a reply or\r\n    letter of advice to Valentinian, which might be regarded as a\r\n    counter-petition. In it he enters upon the arguments of Symmachus.\r\n    Although he could not present the same pathetic figure of an old\r\n    man pleading for the religion of his ancestors, his arguments are\r\n    not unjust, and dispose satisfactorily of the leading points made\r\n    by Symmachus. The line of reasoning represents the best Christian\r\n    opinion of the times on the matter of the relation of the State to\r\n    heathenism.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The illustrious prefect of the city has in a memorial set forth three\r\npropositions which he considers of force—that Rome, he says, asks for her\r\nrites again, that pay be given to her priests and vestal virgins, and that\r\na general famine followed upon the refusal of the priests’ stipends.…\r\n\r\n7. Let the invidious complaints of the Roman people come to an end. Rome\r\nhas given no such charge. She speaks other words. “Why do you daily stain\r\nme with the useless blood of the harmless herd? Trophies of victory depend\r\nnot upon the entrails of the flock, but on the strength of those who\r\nfight. I subdued the world by a different discipline. Camillus was my\r\nsoldier who slew those who had taken the Tarpeian rock, and brought back\r\nto the capitol the standards taken away; valor laid low those whom\r\nreligion had not driven off.… Why do you bring forward the rites of our\r\nancestors? I hate the rites of Neros. Why should I speak of emperors of\r\ntwo months,(116) and the ends of rulers closely joined to their\r\ncommencements. Or is it, perchance, a new thing for barbarians to cross\r\ntheir boundaries? Were they, too, Christians whose wretched and\r\nunprecedented cases, the one a captive emperor(117) and under the\r\nother(118) the captive world,(119) made manifest that their rites which\r\npromised victory were false? Was there then no altar of Victory?…”\r\n\r\n8. By one road, says he, one cannot attain to so great a secret. What you\r\nknow not, that we know by the voice of God. And what you seek by fancies\r\nwe have found out from the very wisdom and truth of God. Your ways,\r\ntherefore, do not agree with ours. You implore peace for your gods from\r\nthe Emperor, we ask peace for our emperors themselves from Christ.…\r\n\r\n10. But, says he, let the ancient altars be restored to their images, and\r\ntheir ornaments to the shrines. Let this demand be made of one who shares\r\nin their superstitions; a Christian emperor has learned to honor the altar\r\nof Christ alone.… Has any heathen emperor raised an altar to Christ? While\r\nthey demand the restoration of things which have been, by their own\r\nexample they show us how great reverence Christian emperors ought to pay\r\nto the religion which they follow, since heathen ones offered all to their\r\nsuperstitions.\r\n\r\nWe began long since, and now they follow those whom they excluded. We\r\nglory in yielding our blood, an expense moves them.… We have increased\r\nthrough loss, through want, through punishment; they do not believe that\r\ntheir rites can continue without contribution.\r\n\r\n11. Let the vestal virgins, he says, retain their privileges. Let those\r\nspeak thus who are unable to believe that virginity can exist without\r\nreward, let those who do not trust virtue, encourage it by gain. But how\r\nmany virgins have their promised rewards gained for them? Hardly are seven\r\nvestal virgins received. See the whole number whom the fillet and chaplets\r\nfor the head, the robes of purple dye, the pomp of the litter surrounded\r\nby a company of attendants, the greatest privileges, immense profits, and\r\na prescribed time for virginity have gathered together.\r\n\r\n12. Let them lift up the eyes of soul and body, let them look upon a\r\npeople of modesty, a people of purity, an assembly of virginity. Not\r\nfillets are the ornament of their heads, but a veil common in use but\r\nennobled by chastity; the enticement of beauty not sought out, but laid\r\naside; none of those purple insignia, no delicious luxuries, but the\r\npractice of fasts; no privileges, no gains; all other things, in fine, of\r\nsuch a kind that one would think them restrained from desire whilst\r\npractising their duties. But whilst the duty is being practised the desire\r\nfor it is aroused. Chastity is increased by its own sacrifice. That is not\r\nvirginity which is bought with a price, and not kept through a desire for\r\nvirtue; that is not purity which is bought by auction for money or which\r\nis bid for a time.\r\n\r\n16. No one has denied gifts to shrines and legacies to soothsayers; their\r\nland only has been taken away, because they did not use religiously that\r\nwhich they claimed in right of religion. Why did not they who allege our\r\nexample practise what we did? The Church has no possessions of her own\r\nexcept the faith. Hence are her returns, her increase. The possessions of\r\nthe Church are the maintenance of the poor. Let them count up how many\r\ncaptives the temples have ransomed, what food they have contributed for\r\nthe poor, to what exiles they have supplied the means of living. Their\r\nlands, then, have been taken away, but not their rights.\r\n\r\n23. He says the rites of our ancestors ought to be retained. But why,\r\nseeing that all things have made a progress toward what is better?… The\r\nday shines not at the beginning, but as time proceeds it is bright with\r\nincrease of light and grows warm with increase of heat.\r\n\r\n27. We, too, inexperienced in age, have an infancy of our senses, but,\r\nchanging as years go by, lay aside the rudimentary conditions of our\r\nfaculties.\r\n\r\n28. Let them say, then, that all things ought to have remained in their\r\nfirst dark beginnings; that the world covered with darkness is now\r\ndispleasing because it has brightened with the rising of the sun. And how\r\nmuch more pleasant is it to have dispelled the darkness of the mind than\r\nthat of the body, and that the rays of faith should have shone than that\r\nof the sun. So, then, the primeval state of the world, as of all things,\r\nhas passed away that the venerable old age of hoary faith might follow.…\r\n\r\n30. If the old rites pleased, why did Rome also take up foreign ones? I\r\npass over the ground hidden with costly buildings, and shepherds’ cottages\r\nglittering with degenerate gold. Why, that I may reply to the very matter\r\nwhich they complain of, have they eagerly received the images of captured\r\ncities, and conquered gods, and the foreign rites of alien superstition?\r\nWhence, then, is the pattern of Cybele washing her chariots in a stream\r\ncounterfeiting the Almo? Whence were the Phrygian prophets and the deities\r\nof unjust Carthage, always hateful to the Romans? And he whom the Africans\r\nworship as Celestis, the Persians as Mithra, and the greater number as\r\nVenus, according to a difference of name, not a variety of deities?\r\n\r\n31. They ask to have her altar erected in the Senate House of the city of\r\nRome, that is where the majority who meet together are Christians! There\r\nare altars in all the temples, and an altar also in the Temple of Victory.\r\nSince they delight in numbers, they celebrate their sacrifices everywhere.\r\nTo claim a sacrifice on this one altar, what is it but to insult the\r\nfaith? Is it to be borne that a heathen should sacrifice and a Christian\r\nbe present?… Shall there not be a common lot in that common assembly? The\r\nfaithful portion of the Senate will be bound by the voices of those who\r\ncall upon the gods, by the oaths of those who swear by them. If they\r\noppose they will seem to exhibit their falsehood, if they acquiesce, to\r\nacknowledge what is a sacrilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 10, 12; A. D. 392.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Decree of Theodosius prohibiting heathen worship as a crime of the\r\n    same character as treason.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following decree may be said to have permanently forbidden\r\n    heathenism, at least in the East, though as a matter of fact many\r\n    heathen not only continued to practise their rites in defiance of\r\n    the law or with the connivance of the authorities, but also\r\n    received appointments at the court and elsewhere. The law was\r\n    never repealed. In course of time heathenism disappeared as a\r\n    religious system.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI, 10, 12. Hereafter no one of whatever race or dignity, whether placed\r\nin office or discharged therefrom with honor, powerful by birth or humble\r\nin condition and fortune, shall in any place or in any city sacrifice an\r\ninnocent victim to a senseless image, venerate with fire the household\r\ndeity by a more private offering, as it were the genius of the house, or\r\nthe Penates, and burn lights, place incense, or hang up garlands. If any\r\none undertakes by way of sacrifice to slay a victim or to consult the\r\nsmoking entrails, let him, as guilty of lese-majesty, receive the\r\nappropriate sentence, having been accused by a lawful indictment, even\r\nthough he shall not have sought anything against the safety of the princes\r\nor concerning their welfare. It constitutes a crime of this nature to wish\r\nto repeal the laws, to spy into unlawful things, to reveal secrets, or to\r\nattempt things forbidden, to seek the end of another’s welfare, or to\r\npromise the hope of another’s ruin. If any one by placing incense\r\nvenerates either images made by mortal labor, or those which are enduring,\r\nor if any one in ridiculous fashion forthwith venerates what he has\r\nrepresented, either by a tree encircled with garlands or an altar of cut\r\nturfs, though the advantage of such service is small, the injury to\r\nreligion is complete, let him as guilty of sacrilege be punished by the\r\nloss of that house or possession in which he worshipped according to the\r\nheathen superstition. For all places which shall smoke with incense, if\r\nthey shall be proved to belong to those who burn the incense, shall be\r\nconfiscated. But if in temples or public sanctuaries or buildings and\r\nfields belonging to another, any one should venture this sort of\r\nsacrifice, if it shall appear that the acts were performed without the\r\nknowledge of the owner, let him be compelled to pay a fine of twenty-five\r\npounds of gold, and let the same penalty apply to those who connive at\r\nthis crime as well as those who sacrifice. We will, also, that this\r\ncommand be observed by judges, defensors, and curials of each and every\r\ncity, to the effect that those things noted by them be reported to the\r\ncourt, and by them the acts charged may be punished. But if they believe\r\nanything is to be overlooked by favor or allowed to pass through\r\nnegligence, they will lie under a judicial warning. And when they have\r\nbeen warned, if by any negligence they fail to punish they will be fined\r\nthirty pounds of gold, and the members of their court are to be subjected\r\nto a like punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 70. The Dogmatic Parties and Their Mutual Relations\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties in the Arian controversy became greatly divided in the course\r\nof the conflict. Speaking broadly, there were still two groups, of which\r\none was composed of all those who regarded the Son as a creature and so\r\nnot eternal and not truly God; and the other, of those who regarded Him as\r\nuncreated and in some real sense eternal and truly God, yet without\r\ndenying the unity of God. The former were the various Arian parties\r\ntending to constant division. The latter can hardly yet be comprised under\r\none common name, and might be called the anti-Arian parties, were it not\r\nthat there was a positive content to their faith which was in far better\r\nharmony with the prevailing religious sentiment of the East and was\r\nconstantly receiving accessions. In the second generation after Nicæa, a\r\nnew group of theologians came to the front, of whom the most important\r\nwere Eustathius of Sebaste, Cyril of Jerusalem, and the three\r\nCappadocians, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa, most of\r\nwhom had at least sympathized with the Homoiousian party. Already at the\r\nsynod of Ancyra, in 358, an approach was made toward a reconciliation of\r\nthe anti-Arian factions, in that, by a more careful definition, homoousios\r\nwas rejected only in the sense of identity of being, and homoiousios was\r\nasserted only in the sense of equality of attributes in the not identical\r\nsubjects which, however, shared in the same essence. Homoiousios did not\r\nmean mere similarity of being. (Anathemas in Hahn, § 162; Hefele, § 80.)\r\nThe line of development ultimately taken was by a precise distinction\r\nbetween _hypostasis_ and _ousia_, whereby _hypostasis_, which never meant\r\nperson in the modern sense, which later is represented by the Greek\r\n_prosopon_, was that which subsists and shares with other _hypostases_ in\r\na common essence or _ousia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Athanasius, _De Synodis_ (PNF); Basil,\r\n    _Epp._ 38, 52, 69, 125 (PNF, ser. II, vol. VIII); Hilary of\r\n    Poitiers, _De Synodis_, cc. 87-91 (PNF, ser. II, vol. IX);\r\n    Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, III, 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil of Alexandria A. D. 362. _Tomus ad Antiochenos_. (MSG, 26:797.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Council of Alexandria, A. D. 362, was held by Athanasius in\r\n    the short time he was allowed to be in his see city at the\r\n    beginning of the reign of Julian. In the synodal letter or tome\r\n    addressed to the Nicene Christians at Antioch we have the\r\n    foundation of the ultimate formula of the Church as opposing\r\n    Arianism, one substance and three persons, one _ousia_ and three\r\n    _hypostases_. The occasion of the letter was an attempt to win\r\n    over the Meletian party in the schism among the anti-Arians of\r\n    Antioch. Meletius and his followers appear to have been\r\n    Homoiousians who were strongly inclined to accept the Nicene\r\n    confession. Their church was in the Old Town, a portion of\r\n    Antioch. Opposed to them was Paulinus with his party, which held\r\n    firmly to the Nicene confession. The difficulty in the way of a\r\n    full recognition of the Nicene statement by Meletius and his\r\n    followers was that it savored of Sabellianism. The difficulty of\r\n    the party of Paulinus in recognizing the orthodoxy of the\r\n    Meletians was their practice of speaking of the three hypostases\r\n    or subsistences, which was condemned by the words of the Nicene\r\n    definition.(120) The outcome of the Alexandrian Council in the\r\n    matter was that a distinction could be made between _ousia_ and\r\n    _hypostasis_, that the difference between the parties was largely\r\n    a matter of terminology, that those who could use the Nicene\r\n    symbol with the understanding that the Holy Ghost was not a\r\n    creature and was not separate from the essence of Christ should be\r\n    regarded as orthodox. Out of this understanding came the “New\r\n    Nicene” party, of which the first might be said to have been\r\n    Meletius, who accepted _homoousios_ in the sense of _homoiousios_,\r\n    and of which the “three great Cappadocians” became the recognized\r\n    leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Council of Alexandria, in addition to condemning the\r\n    Macedonian heresy, in advance of Constantinople, also anticipated\r\n    that assembly by condemning Apollinarianism without mentioning the\r\n    teacher by whom the heresy was taught. It is condemned in the\r\n    seventh section of the tome.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. As many, then, as desire peace with us, and especially those who\r\nassemble in the Old Town, and those again who are seceding from the\r\nArians, do ye call to yourselves, and receive them as parents their sons,\r\nand as tutors and guardians welcome them; and unite them to our beloved\r\nPaulinus and his people, without requiring more from them than to\r\nanathematize the Arian heresy and confess the faith confessed by the holy\r\nFathers at Nicæa and to anathematize also those who say that the Holy\r\nGhost is a creature and separate from the essence of Christ. For this is\r\nin truth a complete renunciation of the abominable heresy of the Arians,\r\nto refuse to divide the Holy Trinity, or to say that any part of it is a\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\n§ 5. … As to those whom some were blaming for speaking of three\r\nsubsistences (hypostases), on the ground that the phrase is unscriptural\r\nand therefore suspicious, we thought it right, indeed, to require nothing\r\nbeyond the confession of Nicæa, but on account of the contention we made\r\ninquiry of them, whether they meant, like the Arian madmen, subsistences\r\nforeign and strange and alien in essence from one another, and that each\r\nsubsistence was divided apart by itself, as is the case with other\r\ncreatures in general and those begotten of men, or like substances, such\r\nas gold, silver, or brass; or whether, like other heretics, they meant\r\nthree beginnings and three Gods, by speaking of three subsistences.\r\n\r\nThey assured us in reply that they neither meant this nor had ever held\r\nit. But upon our asking them “what, then, do you mean by it, or why do you\r\nuse such expressions?” they replied: Because they believe in a Holy\r\nTrinity, not a trinity in name only, but existing and subsisting in truth,\r\nboth Father truly existing and subsisting, and a Son, truly substantial\r\nand subsisting, and a Holy Ghost subsisting and really existing do we\r\nacknowledge, said they, and that neither had they said there were three\r\nGods or three beginnings, nor would they at all tolerate such as said or\r\nheld so, but that they acknowledged a Holy Trinity, but one Godhead and\r\none beginning, and that the Son is co-essential with the Father, as the\r\nFathers said; and the Holy Ghost not a creature, nor external, but proper\r\nto, and inseparable from, the essence of the Father and the Son.\r\n\r\n§ 6. Having accepted, then, these men’s interpretation of their language\r\nand their defence, we made inquiry of those blamed by them for speaking of\r\none subsistence, whether they use the expression in the sense of\r\nSabellius, to the negation of the Son and Holy Ghost, or as though the Son\r\nwas non-substantial, or the Holy Ghost without subsistence. But they in\r\ntheir turn assured us that they neither said this nor had ever held it,\r\nbut, “we use the word subsistence thinking it the same thing to say\r\nsubsistence or essence.”(121) But we hold there is One, because the Son is\r\nof the essence of the Father and because of the identity of nature. For we\r\nbelieve that there is one Godhead, and that the nature of it is one, and\r\nnot that there is one nature of the Father, from which that of the Son and\r\nof the Holy Ghost are distinct. Well, thereupon, they who had been blamed\r\nfor saying that there were three subsistences agreed with the others,\r\nwhile those who had spoken of one essence, also confessed the doctrine of\r\nthe former as interpreted by them. And by both sides Arius was\r\nanathematized as an adversary of Christ, and Sabellius, and Paul of\r\nSamosata as impious men, and Valentinus and Basilides as aliens from the\r\ntruth, and Manichæus as an inventor of mischief. And all, by God’s grace,\r\nand after the above explanations, agreed together that the faith confessed\r\nby the Fathers at Nicæa is better and more accurate than the said phrases,\r\nand that for the future they would prefer to be content to use its\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n§ 7. But since, also, certain seemed to be contending together concerning\r\nthe fleshly economy of the Saviour, we inquired of both parties. And what\r\nthe one confessed the others also agreed to: that not as when the word of\r\nthe Lord came to the prophets, did it dwell in a holy man at the\r\nconsummation of the ages, but that the Word himself was made flesh; and\r\nbeing in the form of God, He took the form of a servant, and from Mary\r\nafter the flesh became man for us, and that thus in Him the human race is\r\nperfectly and wholly delivered from sin and made alive from the dead, and\r\nled into the kingdom of heaven. For they also confess that the Saviour had\r\nnot a body without a soul, nor without sense or intelligence;(122) for it\r\nwas not possible, when the Lord had become man for us, that His body\r\nshould be without intelligence; nor was the salvation, effected in the\r\nWord himself, a salvation of the body only, but of the soul also. And\r\nbeing Son of God in truth, He became also Son of Man; and being God’s only\r\nbegotten Son, He became also at the same time “first-born among many\r\nbrethren.” Wherefore neither was there one Son of God before Abraham,\r\nanother after Abraham: nor was there one that raised up Lazarus, another\r\nthat asked concerning him; but the same it was that said as man, “Where\r\ndoes Lazarus lie?” and as God raised him up; the same that as man and in\r\nthe body spat, but divinely as Son of God opened the eyes of the man blind\r\nfrom his birth; and while, as Peter says, in the flesh He suffered, as God\r\nHe opened the tomb and raised the dead. For which reasons, thus\r\nunderstanding all that is said in the Gospel, they assured us that they\r\nheld the same truth about the Word’s incarnation and becoming man.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 71. The Emperor Theodosius and the Triumph of the New Nicene Orthodoxy\r\nat the Council of Constantinople, A. D. 381\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Theodosius was appointed colleague of Gratian and Valentinian\r\nII, 378. He issued in conjunction with these emperors an edict (_Cod.\r\nTheod._, XVI, 1, 2; _cf._ _Cod. Just._, I, 1, 1, _v. infra_, § 72, _b_,\r\n_e_), requiring all subjects of the Empire to hold the orthodox faith in\r\nthe Trinity. He then called a council of Eastern bishops to meet at\r\nConstantinople in 381 to settle the question as to the succession to the\r\nsee of that city and to confirm the creed of Nicæa as the faith of the\r\nEastern half of the Church. Gregory of Nazianzus was appointed bishop of\r\nConstantinople, but was forced to resign, having formerly been bishop of\r\nSasima, from which he had been translated in violation of the Nicene\r\ncanons. As soon as it was apparent that the bishops would have to accept\r\nthe Nicene faith the thirty-six Macedonians withdrew. Their opinion as to\r\nthe Holy Spirit, that He was not divine in the same sense that the Son was\r\ndivine, was condemned, without express statement of the point condemned,\r\nas was also the teaching of Apollinaris as to the nature of Christ. The\r\ncouncil was not intended to be an ecumenical or general council, and it\r\nwas not regarded as such even in the East until after the Council of\r\nChalcedon, A. D. 451, and then probably on account of the creed which was\r\nthen falsely attributed to the Fathers of Constantinople. In the West the\r\ncouncil was not recognized as an ecumenical council until well into the\r\nsixth century. (See Hefele, § 100.) The council issued no creed and made\r\nno additions to the Nicene creed. It published a tome, since lost, setting\r\nforth the faith in the Trinity. It enacted four canons, of which only the\r\nfirst three are of general application.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Percival, _Seven Ecumenical Councils_\r\n    (PNF); Theodoret, _Hist.

The _Translations and Reprints_ of the\r\n    University of Pennsylvania give translations. For the address of\r\n    the council to Theodosius, see § 72, _b_. The fourth canon is of a\r\n    merely temporary importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 1. The faith of the three hundred and eighteen Fathers who were\r\nassembled at Nicæa in Bithynia shall not be set aside but shall remain\r\ndominant. And every heresy shall be anathematized, especially that of the\r\nEunomians or Anomœans, the Arians or Eudoxians, the semi-Arians or\r\nPneumatomachians, the Sabellians, Marcellians, Photinians, and\r\nApollinarians.\r\n\r\nCanon 2. The bishops are not to go beyond their dioceses to churches lying\r\noutside of their bounds, nor bring confusion on churches; but let the\r\nbishop of Alexandria, according to the canons, alone administer the\r\naffairs of Egypt; and let the bishops of the East manage the East alone,\r\nthe privileges of the church in Antioch, which are mentioned in the canons\r\nof Nicæa, being preserved; and let the bishops of the Asian diocese\r\nadminister the Asian affairs only; and the Pontic bishops only Pontic\r\nmatters; and the Thracian bishops only Thracian matters. And let not the\r\nbishops go beyond their dioceses for ordination or any other\r\necclesiastical ministrations, unless they be invited. And the aforesaid\r\ncanon concerning dioceses being observed, it is evident that the synod of\r\neach province will administer the affairs of that particular province as\r\nwas decreed at Nicæa. But the churches of God in heathen nations must be\r\ngoverned according to the custom which has prevailed from the time of the\r\nFathers.\r\n\r\nCanon 3.

His\r\n    passion for orthodoxy was taken advantage of by Theophilus of\r\n    Antioch to cause trouble for Chrysostom and others; see\r\n    Origenistic controversy, § 87. The _Ancoratus_, from which the\r\n    following creed is taken, is a statement of the Catholic faith\r\n    which, amidst the storms of the Arian controversy, should serve as\r\n    an anchor of salvation for the Christians. The date of the\r\n    following creed, which has come to be known as the Salaminium, is\r\n    374. It is evidently based upon that of Jerusalem given by Cyril.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe in one God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth and\r\nof all things visible and invisible.\r\n\r\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten of\r\nthe Father before all worlds, that is, of the substance of the Father,\r\nlight of light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one\r\nsubstance [homoousios] with the Father; by whom all things were made, both\r\nthose in heaven and those on earth; who for us men and for our salvation\r\ncame down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost and the Virgin\r\nMary, and was made man; He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and\r\nsuffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the\r\nScriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the\r\nFather; and He shall come again in glory to judge the quick and the dead;\r\nof whose kingdom there shall be no end.\r\n\r\nAnd in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from the\r\nFather, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and\r\nglorified, who spake by the prophets; and in one holy Catholic and\r\nApostolic Church; we acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins;\r\nand we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nBut those who say there was a time when He was not, and He was not before\r\nHe was begotten, or He was made of nothing, or of another substance or\r\nessence [hypostasis or ousia], saying that the Son of God is effluent or\r\nvariable—these the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. The Empire And The Imperial State Church\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the period extending from the accession of Constantine (311 or 324) to\r\nthe death of Theodosius the Great (395), the characteristic features of\r\nthe Church’s organization took definite form, and its relations to the\r\nsecular authorities and the social order of the Empire were defined. Its\r\nconstitution with its hierarchical organization of clergy, of courts, and\r\nsynods, together with its intimate union, at least in the East, with the\r\nimperial authority, became fixed (§ 72). As the Church of the Empire, it\r\nwas under the control and patronage of the State; all other forms of\r\nreligion, whether pagan or Christian, schismatical or heretical, were\r\nseverely repressed (§ 73). The Christian clergy, as officials in this\r\nState Church, became a class by themselves in the society of the Empire,\r\nnot only as the recipients of privileges, but as having special functions\r\nin the administration of justice, and eventually in the superintendence of\r\nsecular officials and secular business (§ 74). By degrees the Christian\r\nspirit influenced the spirit of the laws and the popular customs, though\r\nless than at first sight might have been expected; the rigors of slavery\r\nwere mitigated and cruel gladiatorial sports abandoned (§ 75). Meanwhile\r\npopular piety was by no means raised by the influx of vast numbers of\r\nheathen into the Church; bringing with them no little of their previous\r\nmodes of thought and feeling, and lacking the testing of faith and\r\ncharacter furnished by the persecutions, they lowered the general moral\r\ntone of the Church, so that Christians everywhere were affected by these\r\nalien ideas and feelings (§ 76). The Church, however, endeavored to raise\r\nthe moral tone and ideals and to work effectively in society by care for\r\nthe poor and other works of benevolence, and in its regulation of\r\nmarriage, which began in this period to be a favorite subject of\r\nlegislation for the Church’s councils (§ 76). In monasticism this striving\r\nagainst the lowering forces in Christian society and for a higher type of\r\nlife most clearly manifested itself, and, beginning in Egypt, organized\r\nforms of asceticism spread throughout the East and toward the end of the\r\nperiod to the West as well (§ 78). But monasticism was not confined to the\r\nprivate ascetic. The priesthood, as necessarily presenting an example of\r\nhigher moral life, began to be touched by the ascetic spirit, and in the\r\nWest this took the form of enforced clerical celibacy, though the custom\r\nof the East remained far less rigorous (§ 79). In presenting these lines\r\nof development, it is at times convenient to pass beyond the exact bounds\r\nof the period, so that the whole subject may be brought together at this\r\npoint of the history.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 72. The Constitution of the State Church\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church’s constitution received its permanent form in this period. The\r\nconciliar system was carried to its logical completion in the ecumenical\r\ncouncil representing the entire Church and standing at the head of a\r\nsystem which included the provincial and patriarchal councils, at least in\r\ntheory. The clergy were organized into a hierarchy which rested upon the\r\nbasis of the single bishop in his diocese, who had under him his clergy,\r\nand culminated in the patriarchs placed over the great divisions of the\r\nState Church, corresponding to the primary divisions of the Empire. The\r\nEmperor assumed the supreme authority in the Church, and the foundation\r\nwas laid for what became under Justinian Cæsaropapism. By the institution\r\nof the hierarchical gradation of authority and jurisdiction, for the most\r\npart corresponding to the political and administrative divisions of the\r\nEmpire, the Church both assumed a rigidly organized form and came more\r\neasily under the control of the secular authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) The Ecumenical Council\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Council of Nicæa was held before there was any definition of the place\r\nof an ecumenical council. Many councils were held during the Arian\r\ncontroversy that were quite as representative. It was taken for granted\r\nthat the councils were arranged in a scale of authority corresponding to\r\nthe extent of the Church represented. The first clear statement of this\r\nprinciple is at the Council of Constantinople A. D. 382.\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil of Constantinople, A. D. 382, _Canon_ 2. Text, Hefele, § 98.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The so-called second general council was held in 381, but in the\r\n    next year nearly the same bishops were called together by\r\n    Theodosius (_cf._ Theodoret, _Hist. Ec._, V. 9). In a letter\r\n    addressed to the Western bishops at a council at Rome this council\r\n    speaks of their previous meeting at Constantinople in 381 as being\r\n    an ecumenical council. The query suggests itself whether,\r\n    considering the fact that it actually only represented the East\r\n    and did represent more than one patriarchate, “ecumenical” might\r\n    not be understood as being used in a sense similar to that in\r\n    which the African bishops spoke of their councils as\r\n    _universalis_. See Hefele, § 100, note.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following canon is printed as the sixth canon of\r\n    Constantinople, A. D. 381, in Hefele and the other collections,\r\n    _e.g._, Bruns and Percival.\r\n\r\n\r\n… If persons who are neither heretics, nor excommunicated, nor condemned,\r\nnor charged with crime claim to have a complaint in matters ecclesiastical\r\nagainst the bishop,(124) the holy synod commands such to bring their\r\ncharges first before all the bishops of the province, and to prove before\r\nthem the charges against the accused bishop. But should it happen that the\r\ncomprovincials be unable to settle the charges alleged against the bishop,\r\nthe complainants shall have recourse then to the larger synod of the\r\nbishops of that diocese,(125) who shall be called together on account of\r\nthe complaint; and the complainants may not bring their complaint until\r\nthey have agreed in writing to take upon themselves the same punishment\r\nwhich would have fallen upon the accused, in case the complainants in the\r\ncourse of the matter should be proved to have brought a false charge\r\nagainst the bishop. But if any one, holding in contempt these directions,\r\nventure to burden the ear of the Emperor, or the tribunals of the secular\r\njudges, or disturb an ecumenical synod,(126) dishonoring the bishops of\r\ntheir patriarchal province, such shall not be admitted to make complaint,\r\nbecause he despises the canons and violates the Church’s order.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B) The Hierarchical Organization\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Council of Nicæa, A. D. 325, _Canons_. Text, Hefele, § 42. _Cf._\r\nKirch, nn. 364-368.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Canons of organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Canon 4 regulates the ordinations of bishops; Canon 5 orders that\r\n    excommunications in one diocese shall hold good everywhere; Canon\r\n    6 defines the larger provincial organization which eventually\r\n    resulted in the patriarchates; Canon 7 defines the position of the\r\n    bishopric of Jerusalem; Canons 15 and 16 place the bishops\r\n    permanently in their sees and the clergy under their own proper\r\n    bishop.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 4. It is by all means proper that a bishop should be appointed by\r\nall the bishops in the province; but should this be difficult, either on\r\naccount of urgent necessity or because of distance, three at least should\r\nassemble, and the suffrages of the absent should also be given and\r\ncommunicated in writing, and then the ordination should take place. But in\r\nevery province the ratification of what is done should be left to the\r\nmetropolitan.\r\n\r\nCanon 5. Concerning those, whether of the clergy or of the laity, who have\r\nbeen excommunicated in the several provinces, let the provisions of the\r\ncanon be observed by the bishops which provides that persons cast out by\r\nsome be not readmitted by others.… Nevertheless, inquiry should be made\r\nwhether they have been excommunicated through captiousness, or\r\ncontentiousness, or any such like ungracious disposition in the bishops.\r\nAnd that this matter may have due investigation, it is decreed that in\r\nevery province synods shall be held twice a year, in order that when all\r\nthe bishops of the province are assembled together, such questions may be\r\nthoroughly examined by them, that so those who have confessedly offended\r\nagainst their bishop may be seen by all to be for just causes\r\nexcommunicated, until it shall appear fit to a general meeting of the\r\nbishops to pronounce a milder sentence upon them. And let these synods be\r\nheld, the one before Lent (that the pure gift may be offered to God after\r\nall bitterness has been put away) and let the second be held about autumn.\r\n\r\nCanon 6. Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis prevail,\r\nthat the bishop of Alexandria shall have jurisdiction in all these, since\r\nthe like is customary for the bishop of Rome also.(127) Likewise in\r\nAntioch and the other provinces, let the churches retain their privileges.\r\nAnd this is to be universally understood, that if any one be made bishop\r\nwithout the consent of his metropolitan, the great synod has declared that\r\nsuch a man ought not to be bishop. If, however, two or three bishops\r\nshall, from natural love of contradiction, oppose the common suffrage of\r\nthe rest, it being reasonable and in accordance with the ecclesiastical\r\nlaw, then let the choice of the majority prevail.\r\n\r\nCanon 7. Since custom and ancient tradition have prevailed that the bishop\r\nof Ælia [_i.e._, Jerusalem] should be honored, let him, saving its due\r\ndignity to the metropolis, have the next place of honor.\r\n\r\nCanon 15. On account of the great disturbance and discords that occur, it\r\nis decreed that the custom prevailing in certain places contrary to the\r\ncanon must wholly be done away; so that neither bishop, presbyter, nor\r\ndeacon shall pass from city to city. And if any one, after this decree of\r\nthe holy and great synod, shall attempt any such thing or continue in such\r\ncourse, his proceedings shall be utterly void, and he shall be restored to\r\nthe church for which he was ordained bishop or presbyter.\r\n\r\nCanon 16. Neither presbyters, nor deacons, nor any others enrolled among\r\nthe clergy, who, not having the fear of God before their eyes, nor\r\nregarding the ecclesiastical canon, shall recklessly remove from their own\r\nchurch, ought by any means to be received by another church; but every\r\nconstraint should be applied to restore them to their own parishes;(128)\r\nand, if they will not go, they must be excommunicated. And if one shall\r\ndare surreptitiously to carry off and in his own church ordain a man\r\nbelonging to another, without the consent of his own proper bishop from\r\nwhom, although he was enrolled in the clergy list, he has seceded, let the\r\nordination be void.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Synod of Antioch, A. D. 341. _Canons_, Bruns, I, 80 _f._, _Cf._\r\nKirch, nn. 439 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the Council of Antioch, see § 65, _c_. These canons on\r\n    discipline were held in highest authority in the Church, although\r\n    enacted by Arians whose creed was rejected. They obtained this\r\n    position in the law of the Church because they carried further the\r\n    natural line of development long since taken in the ecclesiastical\r\n    system. _Cf._ Hefele, § 56.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 2. All who enter the Church of God and hear the Holy Scriptures, but\r\ndo not communicate with the people in prayers, or who turn away, by reason\r\nof some disorder, from the holy partaking of the eucharist, are to be cast\r\nout of the Church until, after they shall have made confession, have\r\nbrought forth fruits of penance, and have made earnest entreaty, they\r\nshall have obtained forgiveness; and it is unlawful to communicate with\r\nexcommunicated persons, or to assemble in private houses and pray with\r\nthose who do not pray in the Church; or to receive in one church those who\r\ndo not assemble with another church. And if any one of the bishops,\r\npresbyters, or deacons, or any one in the canon shall be found\r\ncommunicating with excommunicated persons, let him also be excommunicated,\r\nas one who brings confusion on the order of the Church.\r\n\r\nCanon 3. If any presbyter or deacon or any one whatever belonging to the\r\npriesthood shall forsake his own parish and shall depart, and, having\r\nwholly changed his residence, shall set himself to remain for a long time\r\nin another parish, let him no longer officiate; especially if his own\r\nbishop shall summon and urge him to return to his own parish, and he shall\r\ndisobey. And if he persist in his disorder, let him be wholly deposed from\r\nhis ministry, so that no further room be left for his restoration. And if\r\nanother bishop shall receive a man deposed for this cause, let him be\r\npunished by the common synod as one who nullifies the ecclesiastical laws.\r\n\r\nCanon 4. If any bishop be deposed by a synod, or any presbyter or deacon,\r\nwho has been deposed by his bishop, shall presume to execute any part of\r\nthe ministry, whether it be a bishop according to his former function, or\r\na presbyter, or a deacon, he shall no longer have any prospect of\r\nrestoration in another synod, nor any opportunity of making his defence;\r\nbut they who communicate with him shall be cast out of the Church, and\r\nparticularly if they have presumed to communicate with the persons\r\naforementioned, knowing the sentence pronounced against them.\r\n\r\nCanon 6. If any one has been excommunicated by his own bishop, let him not\r\nbe received by others until he has either been restored by his own bishop,\r\nor until, when a synod is held, he shall have appeared and made his\r\ndefence, and, having convinced the synod, shall have received a different\r\nsentence. And let this decree apply to the laity, and to the presbyters\r\nand deacons, and all who are enrolled in the clergy list.\r\n\r\nCanon 9. It behooves the bishops in each province to acknowledge the\r\nbishop who presides in the metropolis, and who has to take thought of the\r\nwhole province; because all men of business come together from every\r\nquarter to the metropolis. Wherefore it is decreed that he have precedence\r\nin rank, and that the other bishops do nothing extraordinary without him,\r\naccording to the ancient canon which prevailed from the time of our\r\nfathers, or such things only as pertain to their own particular parishes\r\nand the districts subject to them. For each bishop has authority over his\r\nown parish, both to manage it with piety, which is incumbent on every one,\r\nand to make provision for the whole district which is dependent upon his\r\ncity; to ordain presbyters and deacons; and to settle everything with\r\njudgment. But let him not undertake anything further without the bishop of\r\nthe metropolis; neither the latter without the consent of the others.\r\n\r\nCanon 10. The holy synod decrees that those [bishops] living in village\r\nand country districts, or those who are called chorepiscopi, even though\r\nthey have received ordination to the episcopate, shall regard their own\r\nlimits and manage the churches subject to them, and be content with the\r\ncare and administration of these; but they may ordain readers, subdeacons,\r\nand exorcists, and shall be content with promoting these; but they shall\r\nnot presume to ordain either a presbyter or a deacon, without the consent\r\nof the bishop of the city to which he and his district are subject. And if\r\nhe shall dare to transgress these decrees, he shall be deposed from the\r\nrank which he enjoys. And a chorepiscopus is to be appointed by the bishop\r\nof the city to which he is subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Council of Sardica, A. D. 343 or 344, _Canons_, Bruns, I, 88. _Cf._\r\nMirbt, n. 113, and Kirch, nn. 448 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Council of Sardica was intended to be composed of\r\n    representatives from the entire Empire who might be able to settle\r\n    once and for all the Arian question. It met at Sardica on the\r\n    boundary between the two divisions of the Empire as they were then\r\n    defined. The Eastern ecclesiastics, strongly Arian, found\r\n    themselves outnumbered by the Western bishops who supported\r\n    Athanasius and the Nicene definition of faith. The Eastern\r\n    representatives withdrew to Philippopolis near by, and held their\r\n    own council. The following canons were intended to provide a\r\n    system of appeal for cases like that of Athanasius, and although\r\n    they do not seem to have been acted upon enough to have become a\r\n    part of the Church’s system, yet they were of great importance\r\n    inasmuch as subsequently they were used as late as the ninth\r\n    century for a support to a wholly different system of appeals.\r\n    These canons were very early attributed to the Council of Nicæa A.\r\n    D. 325.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 3. Bishop Hosius said: This, also, it is necessary to add—that\r\nbishops shall not pass from their own province to another province in\r\nwhich there are bishops, unless perchance they are invited by their\r\nbrethren, that we seem not to close the door to charity. But if in any\r\nprovince a bishop have an action against his brother bishop, neither shall\r\ncall in as judge a bishop from another province. But if judgment shall\r\nhave gone against any bishop in a case, and he think that he has a good\r\ncase, in order that the question may be heard, let us, if it be your\r\npleasure, honor the memory of St. Peter the Apostle, and let those who\r\nhave tried the case write to Julius, the bishop of Rome, and if he shall\r\ndecide that the case should be retried, let it be retried, and let him\r\nappoint judges; but if he shall be satisfied that the case is such that\r\nwhat has been done should not be disturbed, what has been decreed shall be\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\nIs this the pleasure of all? The synod answered: It is our pleasure.\r\n\r\nCanon 4. Bishop Gaudentius said: If it please you, it is necessary to add\r\nto this sentence, which full of sincere charity thou hast pronounced, that\r\nif any bishop has been deposed by the judgment of those bishops who\r\nhappened to be in the vicinity, and he asserts that he has fresh matter in\r\ndefence, a new bishop is not to be settled in his see, unless the bishop\r\nof Rome judge and render a decision as to this.\r\n\r\n_Latin Version of Canon 4._ Bishop Gaudentius said: If it please you,\r\nthere ought to be added to this sentence, which full of holiness thou hast\r\npronounced, that if any bishop has been deposed by the judgment of those\r\nbishops who dwell in the vicinity, and he asserts that the business ought\r\nto be conducted by him in the city of Rome, another bishop should in\r\nnowise be ordained in his see after the appellation of him who appears to\r\nhave been deposed, unless the cause shall have been determined by the\r\njudgment of the bishop of Rome.\r\n\r\nCanon 5.(129) Bishop Hosius said: Let it be decreed that if a bishop shall\r\nhave been accused and the assembled bishops of the same region shall have\r\ndeposed him from his office, and he, so to speak, appeals and takes refuge\r\nwith the bishop of the Roman Church and wishes to be heard by him, if\r\nhe(130) think it right to renew the examination of his case, let him be\r\npleased to write to those of fellow-bishops who are nearest the province\r\nthat they may examine the particulars with care and accuracy and give\r\ntheir votes on the matter in accordance with the word of truth. And if any\r\none demand that his case be heard yet again, and at his request it seems\r\ngood to the bishop of Rome to send presbyters from his own side, let it be\r\nin the power of that bishop, according as he judges it to be good and\r\ndecides it to be right, that some be sent to be judges with the bishops\r\nand invested with his authority by whom they were sent. And be this also\r\nordained. But if he thinks that they [the bishops] are sufficient for the\r\nhearing and determining of the matter of the bishop, let him do what shall\r\nseem good in his most prudent judgment.\r\n\r\nThe bishops answered: What has been said is approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Gratian and Valentinian, _Rescript_; A. D. 378. (MSG, 13:586.)\r\nMirbt, nn. 118, _f._\r\n\r\n\r\n    This rescript was sent in answer to a petition addressed to the\r\n    emperors by a Roman council under Damasus. It is, therefore, found\r\n    connected with an epistle in the works of Damasus. It does not\r\n    seem to have been the foundation of any claim or to have played\r\n    any considerable part in the development of the Roman primacy. It\r\n    is of importance in the present connection as illustrating the\r\n    part emperors took in the internal affairs of the Church. For\r\n    Damasus and the disturbances in connection with his election, _v.\r\n    infra_, § 74, _a_. The rescript may be found in Mansi, III, 624;\r\n    Hardouin, I, 842; and in Gieseler, I, 380.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. If any one shall have been condemned by the judgment of Damasus, which\r\nhe shall have delivered with the council of five or seven bishops, or by\r\nthe judgment or council of those who are Catholics, and if he shall\r\nunlawfully attempt to retain his church,(131) in order that such a one,\r\nwho has been called to the priestly judgment, shall not escape by his\r\ncontumacy, it is our will that such a one be remitted by the illustrious\r\nprefects of Gaul and Italy, either by the proconsul or the vicars, use\r\nhaving been made of due authority, to the episcopal judgment, and shall\r\ncome to the city of Rome under an escort; or if such insolence of any one\r\nshall appear in parts very far distant, the entire pleading of his case\r\nshall be brought to the examination of the metropolitan of the province in\r\nwhich the bishop is, or if he himself is the metropolitan, then of\r\nnecessity he shall hasten without delay to Rome, or to those whom the\r\nRoman bishop shall assign as judges, so that whoever shall have been\r\ndeposed shall be removed from the confines of the city in which they were\r\npriests. For we punish those who deserve punishment less severely than\r\nthey deserve, and we take vengeance upon their sacrilegious stubbornness\r\nmore gently than it merits. And if the unfairness or partiality of any\r\nmetropolitan, bishop, or priest is suspected, it is allowed to appeal to\r\nthe Roman bishop or to a council gathered of fifteen neighboring bishops,\r\nbut so that after the examination of the case shall have been concluded\r\nwhat was settled shall not be begun over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 1, 2; Feb. 27, A. D. 380. _Cf._ Kirch, n.\r\n755.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following edict was issued by Gratian, Valentinian and\r\n    Theodosius, requiring the acceptance of the orthodox faith by all\r\n    subjects. In other words, the emperors, following the example of\r\n    Constantius and Valens in enforcing Arianism, are now enforcing\r\n    the Nicene theology. Sozomenus, _Hist. Ec._, VII, 4, gives the\r\n    circumstances under which this edict was issued.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is our will that all the peoples whom the government of our clemency\r\nrules shall follow that religion which a pious belief from Peter to the\r\npresent declares the holy Peter delivered to the Romans, and which it is\r\nevident the pontiff Damasus and Peter, bishop of Alexandria, a man of\r\napostolic sanctity, follow; that is, that according to the apostolic\r\ndiscipline and evangelical doctrine we believe in the deity of the Father\r\nand the Son and the Holy Ghost of equal majesty, in a holy trinity. Those\r\nwho follow this law we command shall be comprised under the name of\r\nCatholic Christians; but others, indeed, we require, as insane and raving,\r\nto bear the infamy of heretical teaching; their gatherings shall not\r\nreceive the name of churches; they are to be smitten first with the divine\r\npunishment and after that by the vengeance of our indignation, which has\r\nthe divine approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 1, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Auxonius, proconsul of\r\n    Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n    To enforce still further the principles of Nicene orthodoxy\r\n    certain bishops were named as teachers of the true faith,\r\n    communion with whom was a test of orthodoxy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe command that all churches be forthwith delivered up to the bishops who\r\nconfess the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost to be of one majesty and\r\npower; of the same glory and of one splendor, making no distinction by any\r\nprofane division, but rather harmony by the assertion of the trinity of\r\nthe persons and the unity of the Godhead, to the bishops who are\r\nassociated in communion with Nectarius, bishop of the Church of\r\nConstantinople, and with Timotheus in Egypt, bishop of the city of\r\nAlexandria; in the parts of the Orient, who are in communion with\r\nPelagius, bishop of Laodicæa and Diodorus, bishop of Tarsus; in\r\nproconsular Asia and in the diocese of Asia, who are in communion with\r\nAmphilochius, bishop of Iconium, and Optimus, bishop of Antioch; in the\r\ndiocese of Pontus, who are in communion with Helladius, bishop of Cæsarea,\r\nand Otreius, bishop of Melitina, and Gregory, bishop of Nyssa, Terennius,\r\nbishop of Scythia, Marmarius, bishop of Marcianopolis. Those who are of\r\nthe communion and fellowship of approved priests(132) ought to be admitted\r\nto possess the Catholic churches; but all who dissent from the communion\r\nof the faith of those whom the special list has named ought to be expelled\r\nfrom the churches as manifest heretics; and no opportunity whatsoever\r\nought to be allowed them henceforth of obtaining episcopal churches(133)\r\nthat the priestly orders of the true and Nicene faith may remain pure and\r\nno place be given to evil cunning, according to the evident form of our\r\nprecept.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Council of Constantinople, A. D. 381. _Address to Theodosius._ See\r\nMansi, III, 557.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following letter illustrates the relation of the councils in\r\n    the East to the imperial authority. The emperors called the\r\n    various general councils, directed their discussions and confirmed\r\n    the results. In this way their findings were given the force of\r\n    laws and authority throughout the Church. _V. infra_, §§ 90, 91.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the most religious Emperor Theodosius, the holy synod of bishops\r\nassembled in Constantinople out of different provinces.\r\n\r\nWe begin our letter to your Piety with thanks to God, who has established\r\nthe Empire of your Piety for the common peace of the churches and for the\r\nsupport of the true faith. And, after rendering due thanks unto God, as in\r\nduty bound, we lay before your Piety the things which have been done in\r\nthe holy synod. When, then, we had assembled in Constantinople, according\r\nto the letter of your Piety, we first of all renewed our unity of heart\r\neach with the other, and then we pronounced some concise definitions,\r\nratifying the faith of the Nicene Fathers, and anathematizing the heresies\r\nwhich have sprung up contrary thereto. Besides these things, we also\r\nframed certain canons for the better ordering of the churches, all which\r\nwe have subjoined to this our letter. We therefore beseech your Piety that\r\nthe decree of the synod may be ratified, to the end that as you have\r\nhonored the Church by your letter of citation, so you should set your seal\r\nto the conclusion of what has been decreed. May the Lord establish your\r\nEmpire in peace and righteousness, and prolong it from generation to\r\ngeneration; and may He add unto your earthly powers the fruition of the\r\nheavenly kingdom also. May God, by the prayers of the saints, show favor\r\nto the world, that you may be strong and eminent in all good things as an\r\nEmperor most truly pious and beloved of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Synod of Antioch, A. D. 341, _Canons_, Bruns, I, 80.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following canons passed at Antioch are the first touching a\r\n    habit which they did little to correct. The so-called sixth canon\r\n    of Constantinople, 381, in reality a canon of the council of the\r\n    next year, took up the matter again. All through the great\r\n    controversies appeals were constantly made to the emperors\r\n    because, after all, they alone had the authority. _Cf._ Hefele, §\r\n    56.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 11. If any bishop, or presbyter, or any one whatever of the canon\r\nshall presume to betake himself to the Emperor without the consent and\r\nletters of his bishop of the province and particularly of the bishop of\r\nthe metropolis, such a one shall be publicly deposed and cast out, not\r\nonly from the communion, but also from the rank which he happens to have\r\nhad; inasmuch as he dares to trouble the ears of our Emperor, beloved of\r\nGod, contrary to the law of the Church. But, if necessary business shall\r\nrequire any one to go to the Emperor, let him do it with the advice and\r\nconsent of the metropolitan and other bishops in the province, and let him\r\nundertake his journey with the letters from them.\r\n\r\nCanon 12. If any presbyter or deacon deposed by his own bishop, or any\r\nbishop deposed by a synod, shall dare trouble the ears of the Emperor,\r\nwhen it is his duty to submit his case to a greater synod of bishops, and\r\nto refer to more bishops the things which he thinks right, and to abide by\r\nthe examination and decision made by them; if, despising these, he shall\r\ntrouble the Emperor, he shall be entitled to no pardon, neither shall he\r\nhave opportunity of defence, nor any hope of future restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 73. Sole Authority of the State Church\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Theodosius had successfully forced upon the East the theology of\r\nNicæa, his policy as to religious matters was manifest. No longer was\r\nheresy to be allowed. Laws were to control opinion in the same way that\r\nthey did conduct. The old plea of the persecuted Christians under the\r\nheathen Roman Empire, _religio non cogi potest_, was completely forgotten.\r\nAs Christianity was the one sole religion of divine character, based upon\r\nthe unique divine act of the incarnation, it was folly to allow men to\r\ncontinue in heathenism—it might even be dangerous to the State to allow\r\nthem, as it might bring down the just vengeance of God. With this policy\r\nthe populace was completely in accord, especially when it led to the\r\nplunder and destruction of heathen sanctuaries, and many of the more\r\nzealous of the clergy were willing to lead in the assault. In these ways\r\nthe State Church obtained a two-fold exclusive authority: as regards\r\nheathenism, and as regards heresy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Codex Theodosianus._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Laws regarding heathenism.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI, 10, 14; A. D. 399.\r\n\r\nWhatever privileges were conceded by the ancient laws to the priests,\r\nministers, prefects, hierophants of sacred things, or by whatsoever name\r\nthey may be designated, are to be abolished henceforth, and let them not\r\nthink that they are protected by a granted privilege when their religious\r\nconfession is known to have been condemned by the law.\r\n\r\nXVI, 10, 16; A. D. 399.\r\n\r\nIf there are temples in the fields, let them be destroyed without crowd or\r\ntumult. For when these have been thrown down and carried away, the support\r\nof superstition will be consumed.\r\n\r\nXVI, 10, 15; A. D. 399.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This law appears again in the _Cod. Just._, I, 13, 3, for it\r\n    appears to have been necessary even as late as the sixth century\r\n    to prevent unauthorized destructions of temples which were in the\r\n    cities and might be fairly regarded as ornaments to the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe prohibit sacrifices yet so that we wish that the ornaments of public\r\nworks to be preserved. And that those who attempt to overthrow them may\r\nnot flatter themselves that it is with some authority, if any rescript or,\r\nperchance, law is alleged, let these documents be taken from their hands\r\nand referred to our knowledge.\r\n\r\nXVI, 10, 21; A. D. 416.\r\n\r\nThose who are polluted by the error or crime of pagan rites are not to be\r\nadmitted to the army nor to receive the distinction and honor of\r\nadministrator or judge.\r\n\r\nXVI, 10, 23; A. D. 423.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pagans that remain ought to be subjected to capital\r\npunishment if at any time they are detected in the abominable sacrifices\r\nof demons, let exile and confiscation of goods be their punishment.\r\n\r\nXVI, 10, 24; A. D. 423. (Retained in _Cod. Just._, I, 11, 16.)\r\n\r\nThe Manichæans and those who are called Pepyzitæ [Montanists] and also\r\nthose who by this one opinion are worse than all heretics, in that they\r\ndissent from all as to the venerable day of the Easter festival, we\r\nsubject to the same punishment, viz.: confiscation of goods and exile, if\r\nthey persist in the same unreason. But this we especially demand of\r\nChristians, both those who are really such and those who are called such,\r\nthat they presume not, by an abuse of religion, to lay hands upon the Jews\r\nand pagans who live peaceably and who attempt nothing riotous or contrary\r\nto the laws. For if they should do violence to them living securely and\r\ntake away their goods, let them be compelled to restore not merely what\r\nthey have taken away but threefold and fourfold. Let the rectors of\r\nprovinces, officials, and provincials know that if they permit these\r\nthings to be done, they themselves will be punished, as well as those who\r\ndo them.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Theodoret, _Hist. Ec._, V, 29. (MSG, 82:1256.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The destruction of temples.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following passage is illustrative of the temper of those who\r\n    took part in the destruction of heathen sanctuaries. The imperial\r\n    edicts for these acts were obtained in 399. Chrysostom, the leader\r\n    in the movement, fairly represents the best thought and temper of\r\n    the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn receiving information that Phœnicia was still suffering from the\r\nmadness of the demons’ rites, he [John Chrysostom] got together some monks\r\nfired with divine zeal and despatched them, armed with imperial edicts,\r\nagainst the idols’ shrines. He did not draw from the imperial treasury the\r\nmoney to pay the craftsmen and their assistants who were engaged in the\r\nwork of destruction, but he persuaded certain faithful and wealthy women\r\nto make liberal contributions, pointing out to them how great would be the\r\nblessing their generosity would win. Thus the remaining shrines of the\r\ndemons were utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, VII, 15. (MSG, 67:768.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The murder of Hypatia.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The fearful murder of Hypatia represents another aspect of the\r\n    opposition to heathenism, in which the populace seconded the\r\n    efforts of the authorities in a policy of extirpating paganism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a woman in Alexandria named Hypatia. She was the daughter of the\r\nphilosopher Theon, and she had attained such a proficiency in literature\r\nand science as to surpass by far all the philosophers of her own time.\r\nHaving succeeded to the Platonic school, which had come down from\r\nPlotinus, she explained all the principles of philosophy to her auditors.\r\nTherefore many from all sides, wishing to study philosophy, came to her.\r\nOn account of the self-possession and ease of manner which she had\r\nacquired by her study, she not infrequently appeared with modesty in the\r\npresence of magistrates. Neither did she feel abashed in entering an\r\nassembly of men. For all men, on account of her extraordinary dignity and\r\nvirtue, admired her the more. Against her envious hostility arose at that\r\ntime. For as she had frequent interviews with Orestes [governor of\r\nAlexandria] it was calumniously reported among the Christian populace that\r\nit was she who prevented Orestes from being reconciled to the bishop\r\n[Cyril]. Some men of this opinion and of a hot-headed disposition, whose\r\nleader was a reader named Peter, waylaid her returning home. Dragging her\r\nfrom her carriage they took her to the church called Cæsareum. There they\r\ncompletely stripped her and murdered her with tiles. When they had torn\r\nher in pieces, they took her mangled limbs to a place called Cinaron, and\r\nthere they burnt them. This affair brought no little opprobrium, not only\r\nupon Cyril but also upon the whole Alexandrian Church. And surely murders,\r\nfights, and actions of that sort are altogether alien to those who hold\r\nthe things of Christ. These things happened in the fourth year of the\r\nepiscopate of Cyril [415].\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, VII, 11. (MSG, 67:757.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Novatians and the Church at the beginning of the fifth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Socrates is the principal authority for the later history of the\r\n    Novatians. It is probable that his interest in them and evident\r\n    sympathy for them were due to some connection with the sect,\r\n    perhaps in his early years, and he gives many incidents in their\r\n    history, otherwise unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Innocent [401-417], Zosimus [417-418] governed the Roman Church for\r\ntwo years, and after him Boniface [418-422] presided over it for three\r\nyears. Celestinus [422-432] succeeded him, and this Celestinus took away\r\nthe churches from the Novatians at Rome and obliged Rusticula, their\r\nbishop, to hold his meetings secretly in private houses. Until this time\r\nthe Novatians had flourished exceedingly in Rome, having many churches\r\nthere and gathering large congregations. But envy attacked them there,\r\nalso, as soon as the Roman episcopate, like that of Alexandria, extended\r\nitself beyond the limits of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and degenerated\r\ninto its present state of secular domination. And for this cause the\r\nbishops would not suffer even those who agreed with them in matters of\r\nfaith to enjoy the privileges of assembling in peace, but stripping them\r\nof all they possessed, praised them merely for these agreements in faith.\r\nThe bishops of Constantinople kept themselves free from this sort of\r\nconduct; in so much as in addition to tolerating them and permitting them\r\nto hold their assemblies within the city, as I have already stated,(134)\r\nthey treated them with every mark of Christian regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 5, 40; A. D. 407.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Edict of Arcadius and Honorius against the Manichæans and other\r\n    heretics. (Retained in _Cod. Just._, I, 5, 4.) _Cf._ Mirbt, n.\r\n    155.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we have thought concerning the Donatists we have recently set forth.\r\nEspecially do we pursue, with well-merited severity, the Manichæans, the\r\nPhrygians, and the Priscillianists,(135) since men of this sort have\r\nnothing in common with others, neither in custom nor laws. And first we\r\ndeclare that their crime is against the State, because what is committed\r\nagainst the divine religion is held an injury of all. And we will take\r\nvengeance upon them by the confiscation of their goods, which, however, we\r\ncommand shall fall to whomsoever is nearest of their kindred, in ascending\r\nor descending lines or cognates of collateral branches to the second\r\ndegree, as the order is in succession to goods. Yet it shall be so that we\r\nsuffer the right to receive the goods to belong to them, only if they\r\nthemselves are not in the same way polluted in their conscience. And it is\r\nour will that they be deprived of every grant or succession from whatever\r\ntitle derived. In addition, we do not leave to any one convicted of this\r\ncrime the right of giving, buying, selling, or finally of making a\r\ncontract. The prosecution shall continue till death. For if in the case of\r\nthe crime of treason it is lawful to attack the memory of the deceased,\r\nnot without desert ought he to endure condemnation. Therefore let his last\r\nwill and testament be invalid, whether he leave property by testament,\r\ncodicil, epistle, or by any sort of will, if ever he has been convicted of\r\nbeing a Manichæan, Phrygian, or Priscillianist, and in this case the same\r\norder is to be followed as in the grades above stated; and we do not\r\npermit sons to succeed as heirs unless they forsake the paternal\r\ndepravity; for we grant forgiveness of the offence to those repenting. We\r\nwill that slaves be without harm if, rejecting their sacrilegious master,\r\nthey pass over to the Catholic Church by a more faithful service. Property\r\non which a congregation of men of this sort assemble, in case the owner,\r\nalthough not a participator in the crime, is aware of the meeting and does\r\nnot forbid it, is to be annexed to our patrimony; if the owner is\r\nignorant, let the agent or steward of the property, having been punished\r\nwith scourging, be sent to labor in the mines, and the one who hires the\r\nproperty, if he be a person liable to such sort of punishment, be\r\ndeported. Let the rectors of provinces, if by fraud or force they delay\r\nthe punishment of these crimes when they have been reported, or if\r\nconviction have been obtained neglect punishment, know that they will be\r\nsubject to the fine of twenty pounds of gold. As for defensors and heads\r\nof the various cities and the provincial officials, a penalty of ten\r\npounds is to compel them to do their duty, unless performing those things\r\nwhich have been laid down by the judges in this matter, they give the most\r\nintelligent care and the most ready help.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Leo the Great, _Epistula_ 7. (MSL, 54:620.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Manichæanism in Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This epistle, addressed to the bishops throughout Italy, shows the\r\n    way in which zealous bishops could, and were expected to,\r\n    co-operate with the secular authorities in putting down heresy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Leo the Great [440-461], the greatest of the popes before Gregory\r\n    the Great, was equally great as an ecclesiastical statesman, as\r\n    theologian, and universally acknowledged leader of the Roman\r\n    people in the times of the invasions of Attila and Genseric.\r\n    Without being the creator of the papal idea, he was able so to\r\n    gather up the elements that had been developed by Siricius,\r\n    Innocent, and others, as to give it a classical expression that\r\n    almost warrants one in describing him as the first of the popes in\r\n    the later sense of that term. His literary remains consist of\r\n    sermons, of which ninety-six are genuine, in which, among other\r\n    matters, he sets forth his conception of the Petrine prerogative\r\n    (see below, § 87, _b_), and letters in which he deals with the\r\n    largest questions of ecclesiastical politics, especially in the\r\n    matter of the condemnation of Monophysitism at the Council of\r\n    Chalcedon. See below, § 91.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur search has discovered in the city a great many followers and teachers\r\nof the Manichæan impiety, our watchfulness has proclaimed them, and our\r\nauthority and censure have checked them: those whom we could reform we\r\nhave corrected and driven to condemn Manichæus with his preachings and\r\nteachings, by public confession in the Church, and by the subscription of\r\ntheir own hands; and thus we have lifted those who have acknowledged their\r\nfault from the pit of their impiety, by granting them opportunity for\r\nrepentance. But some who had so deeply involved themselves that no remedy\r\ncould assist them have been subjected to the laws, in accordance with the\r\nconstitutions of our Christian princes, and lest they should pollute the\r\nholy flock by their contagion, have been banished into perpetual exile by\r\nthe public judges. And all the profane and disgraceful things which are\r\nfound, as well in their writings as in their secret traditions, we have\r\ndisclosed and clearly proved to the eyes of Christian laity, that the\r\npeople might know what to shrink from or avoid; so that he that was called\r\ntheir bishop was himself tried by us and betrayed the criminal views which\r\nhe held in his mystic religion, as the record of our proceedings can show\r\nyou. For this, too, we have sent you for instruction; and after reading\r\nthem you will be able to understand all the discoveries we have made.\r\n\r\nAnd because we know that some of those who are involved here in too close\r\nan accusation for them to clear themselves have fled, we have sent this\r\nletter to you, beloved, by our acolyte; that your holiness, dear brothers,\r\nmay be informed of this, and see fit to act more diligently and\r\ncautiously, lest the men of Manichæan error be able to find opportunity of\r\nhurting your people and of teaching these impious doctrines. For we cannot\r\notherwise rule those intrusted to us unless we pursue, with the zeal of\r\nfaith in the Lord, those who are destroyers and destroyed; and with what\r\nseverity we can bring to bear, cut them off from intercourse with sound\r\nminds, lest this pestilence spread much wider. Wherefore I exhort you,\r\nbeloved, I beseech and warn you to use such watchful diligence as you\r\nought and can employ in tracking them out lest they find opportunity of\r\nconcealment anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Leo the Great, _Epistula_ 15. (MSL, 54:680.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    An account of the tenets of the Priscillianists. Leo is answering\r\n    a letter sent him by Bishop Turribius of Asturia, in which that\r\n    bishop had given him statements about the faith of these\r\n    sectaries. It appears that these statements which Leo quotes and\r\n    refutes in brief are not wholly correct and that the\r\n    Priscillianists were far from being as heretical as they have been\r\n    commonly represented. See articles in the recent encyclopædias,\r\n    _e.g._, New Schaff-Herzog, and Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th ed.\r\n    The change in opinion is due to the discovery of writings of\r\n    Priscillian himself. Nevertheless, these statements, defective as\r\n    they may be, represent the opinion of the times as to these\r\n    heretics and the general attitude toward what was regarded as\r\n    heretical and savoring of Manichæanism.(136)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. And so under the first head is shown what impious views they hold about\r\nthe divine Trinity; they affirm that the person of the Father, the Son,\r\nand the Holy Ghost is one and the same, as if the same God were named now\r\nFather, now Son, now Holy Ghost; and as if He who begat were not one, He\r\nwho was begotten another, and He who proceedeth from both yet another; but\r\nan undivided unity must be understood, spoken of under three names, but\r\nnot consisting of three persons.…\r\n\r\n2. Under the second head is displayed their foolish and empty fancy about\r\nthe issue of certain virtues from God which He began to possess, and which\r\nwere posterior to God in His own essence.…\r\n\r\n3. Again the language of the third head shows that these same impious\r\npersons assert that the Son of God is called “only begotten” for this\r\nreason that He alone was born of a virgin.…\r\n\r\n4. The fourth head deals with the fact that the birthday of Christ, which\r\nthe Catholic Church venerates as His taking on Him the true man, because\r\n“the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,” is not truly honored by these\r\nmen, but they pretend that they honor it, for they fast on that day, as\r\nthey do also on the Lord’s Day, which is the day of Christ’s resurrection.\r\nNo doubt they do this because they do not believe that Christ the Lord was\r\ntruly born in man’s nature, but maintain that by a sort of illusion there\r\nwas an appearance of what was not a reality.\r\n\r\n5. Their fifth head refers to their assertion that man’s soul is a part of\r\nthe divine substance, and that the nature of our human state does not\r\ndiffer from its Creator’s nature.…\r\n\r\n6. The sixth points out that they say that the devil never was good and\r\nthat his nature is not God’s handiwork, but that he came forth of chaos\r\nand darkness.…\r\n\r\n7. In the seventh place follows that they condemn marriage and are\r\nhorrified at begetting children, in which, as in nearly all things, they\r\nagree with the profanity of the Manichæans.\r\n\r\n8. Their eighth point is that the formation of men’s bodies is the device\r\nof the devil and that the seed of conception is shaped by the aid of\r\ndemons in the womb.…\r\n\r\n9. The ninth notice declares that they say that the sons of promise are\r\nborn, indeed, of women, conceived by the Holy Spirit; lest the offspring\r\nthat is born of carnal seed should seem to share in God’s estate.…\r\n\r\n10. Under the tenth head they are reported as asserting that the souls\r\nwhich are placed in men’s bodies have previously been without a body and\r\nhave sinned in their heavenly habitation and for this reason have fallen\r\nfrom their high estate to a lower one alighting upon ruling spirits of\r\ndivers qualities, and after passing through a succession of powers of the\r\nair and stars, some fiercer, some milder, are enclosed in bodies of\r\ndifferent sorts and conditions, so that whatever variety and inequality is\r\nmeted out to us in this life, seems the result of previous causes.…\r\n\r\n11. Their eleventh blasphemy is that in which they suppose that both the\r\nsouls and bodies of men are under the influence of fatal stars.…\r\n\r\n12. The twelfth of these points is this: that they map out the parts of\r\nthe soul under certain powers and the limbs under others; and they suggest\r\nthe characters of the inner powers that rule the soul by giving them the\r\nnames of the patriarchs; and on the other hand, they attribute the signs\r\nof the stars to those under which they put the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 74. The Position of the State Church in the Social Order of the Empire\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the Church exposed the Church to worldliness whereby\r\nselfish men, or men carried away with partisan zeal, took advantages of\r\nits privileges or contended fiercely for important appointments. The\r\nclergy all too frequently ingratiated themselves with wealthy members of\r\ntheir flocks that they might receive from them valuable legacies, an abuse\r\nwhich had to be corrected by civil law; factional spirit occasionally led\r\nto bloodshed in episcopal elections. But on the other hand the Church was\r\nemployed by the State in an important work which properly belonged to the\r\nsecular administration, viz., the administration of justice in the\r\nepiscopal courts of arbitration, for which see _Cod.

I; and in the supervision of civil officials in the\r\nexpenditures of funds for public improvements. These are but instances of\r\ntheir large public activity according to law.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Ammianus Marcellinus, _Hist. Rom._, XXVII, 3, §§ 12 _ff._ _Cf._\r\nKirch, nn. 607 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Damasus and Ursinus.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The strife which attained shocking proportions in connection with\r\n    the election of Damasus seems to have been connected with the\r\n    schism at Rome occasioned by the attitude of Liberius in the Arian\r\n    controversy. Damasus proved one of the ablest bishops that Rome\r\n    ever had in the ancient Church. For aid in overcoming the\r\n    partisans of Ursinus a Roman council appealed to the Emperor\r\n    Gratian, whose answer is given in part above, § 72, _e_.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Damasus and Ursinus, being both immoderately eager to obtain the\r\nbishopric, formed parties and carried on the conflict with great asperity,\r\nthe partisans of each carrying their violence to actual battle, in which\r\nmen were wounded and killed. And as Juventius, prefect of the city, was\r\nunable to put an end to it, or even to soften these disorders, he was at\r\nlast by their violence compelled to withdraw to the suburbs.\r\n\r\n13. Ultimately Damasus got the best of the strife by the strenuous efforts\r\nof his partisans. It is certain that on one day one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven dead bodies were found in the Basilica of Sicinus, which is a\r\nChristian church. And the populace who had thus been roused to a state of\r\nferocity were with great difficulty restored to order.\r\n\r\n14. I do not deny, when I consider the ostentation that reigns at Rome,\r\nthat those who desire such rank and power may be justified in laboring\r\nwith all possible exertion and vehemence to obtain their wishes; since\r\nafter they have succeeded, they will be secure for the future, being\r\nenriched by offerings of matrons, riding in carriages, dressing\r\nsplendidly, and feasting luxuriously, so that their entertainments surpass\r\neven royal banquets.\r\n\r\n15. And they might be really happy if, despising the vastness of the city\r\nwhich they excite against themselves by their vices, they were to live in\r\nimitation of some of the priests in the provinces, whom the most rigid\r\nabstinence in eating and drinking, and plainness of apparel, and eyes\r\nalways cast on the ground, recommend to the everlasting Deity and His true\r\nworshippers as pure and sober-minded men.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XVI, 2, 20; A. D. 370. _Cf._ Kirch, n. 759.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following law is only one of several designed to correct what\r\n    threatened to become an intolerable abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nEcclesiastics and those who wish to be known by the name of the\r\ncontinent(137) are not to come into possession of the houses of widows and\r\norphan girls, but are to be put aside by public courts if afterward the\r\naffines and near relatives of such think that they ought to be put away.\r\nAlso we decree that the aforesaid may acquire nothing whatsoever from the\r\nliberality of that woman to whom privately, under the cloak of religion,\r\nthey have attached themselves, or from her last will; and all shall be of\r\nno effect which has been left by one of these to them, they shall not be\r\nable to receive anything by way of donation or testament from a person in\r\nsubjection. But if, by chance, after the warning of our law, these women\r\nshall think something is to be left to them by way of donation or in their\r\nlast will, let it be seized by the fisc. But if they should receive\r\nanything by the will of those women in succession to whom or to whose\r\ngoods they have the support of the _jus civile_ or the benefit of the\r\nedict, let them take it as relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Codex Theodosianus_, I, 27, 2; A. D. 408.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Edict of Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius II concerning the\r\n    _Audientia Episcopalis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    According to Roman law many cases were frequently decided by an\r\n    arbitrator, according to an agreement between the litigants. The\r\n    bishops had long acted as such in many cases among Christians. As\r\n    they did not always decide suits on authorization by the courts,\r\n    their decisions did not have binding authority in all cases. But\r\n    after Constantine’s recognition of the Church they were given\r\n    authority to decide cases, and according to an edict of 333 their\r\n    decisions were binding even if only one litigant appealed to his\r\n    judgment. But this was reduced to cases in which there was an\r\n    agreement between the parties. The following law, the earliest\r\n    extant, though probably not the earliest, may be found, curtailed\r\n    by the omission of the second sentence, in _Cod. Just._, I, 4, 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn episcopal judgment shall be binding upon all who chose to be heard by\r\nthe priests.(138) For since private persons may hear cases between those\r\nwho consent, even without the knowledge of the judges, we suffer it to be\r\npermitted them. That respect is to be shown their decisions which is\r\nrequired to be shown your authority,(139) from which there is no appeal.\r\nBy the court and the officials execution is to be given the sentence, so\r\nthat the episcopal judicial examination may not be rendered void.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Codex Theodosianus_, II, 1, 10; A. D. 398.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Law of Arcadius and Honorius.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following law is cited to show that in the legalization of the\r\n    _Audientia Episcopalis_ the legislation followed a principle that\r\n    was not peculiar to the position of the Church as the State\r\n    Church. The Jews had a similar privilege. The conditions under\r\n    which their religious authorities could act as arbitrators were\r\n    similar to that in which the bishops acted. This edict can also be\r\n    found in _Cod. Just._, I, 9, 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nJews living at Rome, according to common right, are in those cases which\r\ndo not pertain to their superstition, their court, laws, and rights, to\r\nattend the courts of justice, and are to bring and defend legal actions\r\naccording to the Roman laws; hereafter let them be under our laws. If,\r\nindeed, any by agreement similar to that for the appointment of\r\narbitrators, decide that the litigation be before the Jews or the\r\npatriarchs by the consent of both parties and in business of a purely\r\ncivil character, they are not forbidden by public law to choose their\r\ncourts of justice; and let the provincial judges execute their decisions\r\nas if the arbitrators had been assigned them by the sentence of a judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Codex Justinianus_, I, 4, 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following law of the Emperor Justinian, A. D. 530, is one of\r\n    many showing the way in which the bishops were employed in many\r\n    duties of the State which hardly fell to their part as\r\n    ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the yearly affairs of cities, whether they concern the\r\nordinary revenues of the city, either from funds derived from the property\r\nof the city, or from legacies and private gifts, or given or received from\r\nother sources, whether for public works, or for provisions, or public\r\naqueducts, or the maintenance of baths or ports, or the construction of\r\nwalls and towers, or the repairing of bridges and roads, or for trials in\r\nwhich the city may be engaged in reference to public or private interests,\r\nwe decree as follows: The very pious bishop and three men of good\r\nreputation, in every respect the first men of the city, shall meet and\r\neach year not only examine the work done, but take care that those who\r\nconduct them or have been conducting them, shall manage them with\r\nexactness, shall render their accounts, and show by the production of the\r\npublic records that they have duly performed their engagements in the\r\nadministration of the sums appropriated for provisions, or baths, or for\r\nthe expenses involved in the maintenance of roads, aqueducts, or any other\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 75. Social Significance of the State Church\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church at no time degenerated into a mere department of the State. In\r\nspite of the worldly passions that invaded it and the dissensions that\r\ndistracted it, the Church remained mindful of its duty as not merely a\r\nguardian of the deposit of faith but as a school of Christian morality.\r\nThis was the principle of the penitential discipline of the ante-Nicene\r\nperiod. It was saved from becoming a mere form, or lost altogether by the\r\ncustom which became general after 400, of having the confession of sin\r\nmade in private. In matters of great moral concern, such as the treatment\r\nof slaves, marriage, and divorce, and the cruel sports of the arena, the\r\nChurch was able to exert its influence and eventually bring about a change\r\nin the law. And in standing for righteousness, instances were not lacking\r\nwhen the highest were rebuked by the Church, as in the great case of\r\nAmbrose and Theodosius.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Leo the Great, _Epistula_ 168, ch. 2. (MSL, 54:1210.) _Cf._\r\nDenziger, n. 145.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Confession should no longer be public, but only private. From the\r\n    tone of the letter it would appear that private confession had\r\n    been customary for some time and that public confession had so far\r\n    gone out of use as to appear as a novelty. _V. supra_, § 42.\r\n\r\n\r\nI direct that that presumptuous violation of the apostolic rule be\r\nentirely done away, which we have recently learned has been without\r\nwarrant committed by some; namely, concerning penance, which is demanded\r\nof the faithful, that a written confession in a schedule concerning the\r\nnature of each particular sin be not recited publicly, since it suffices\r\nthat the guilt of conscience be made known by a secret confession to the\r\npriests alone. Although that fulness of faith appears to be laudable which\r\non account of the fear of God is not afraid to blush before men, yet\r\nbecause the sins of all are not such that those who demand penance would\r\nnot be afraid to publish them, let a custom so objectionable be done away;\r\nthat many may not be deterred from the remedies of penitence, since they\r\nare ashamed or are afraid to disclose their deed to their enemies, by\r\nwhich they might be ruined by the requirements of the laws. For that\r\nconfession suffices which is first offered to God, then further to the\r\npriest, who intervenes as with intercessions for the sins of the penitent.\r\nIn this way many can be brought to penitence if the bad conscience of the\r\none making the confession is not published in the ears of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Codex Theodosianus_, IV, 7, 1; A. D. 321. _Cf._ Kirch, n. 749.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Edict of Constantine granting the privilege of manumission to take\r\n    place in churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Church does not seem to have been opposed to slavery as an\r\n    institution. It recognized it as a part of the social order,\r\n    following the advice of St. Paul. But, at the same time, also\r\n    following his advice, it endeavored to inculcate Christian love in\r\n    the treatment of slaves, and legislated frequently on the matter.\r\n    The edict of Constantine was in favor of this humane teaching of\r\n    the Church to the extent that it enabled it to forward the\r\n    tendency toward manumission of slaves, which the Church taught as\r\n    a pious act. This edict is to be found in _Cod. Just._, I, 13, 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who from the motives of religion shall give deserved liberty to\r\ntheir slaves in the midst of the Church shall be regarded as having given\r\nthe same with the same legal force as that by which Roman citizenship has\r\nbeen customarily given with the traditional solemn rites. But this is\r\npermitted only to those who give this liberty in the presence of the\r\npriest. But to the clergy we concede more, so that, when they give liberty\r\nto their slaves, they may be said to have granted a full enjoyment of\r\nliberty, not merely in the face of the Church and the religious people,\r\nbut also, when in their last disposition of their effects they shall have\r\ngiven liberty or shall direct by any words whatsoever that it be given, on\r\nthe day of the publication of their will liberty, without any witness or\r\nintervention of the law, shall belong to them immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Canons bearing on Slavery:\r\n\r\n\r\nSynod of Elvira, A. D. 309, _Canon_ 5, Bruns, II, 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a mistress seized with furious passion beat her female slave with whips\r\nso that within three days she gives up her soul in suffering, inasmuch as\r\nit is uncertain whether she killed her wilfully or by chance, let her, if\r\nit was done wilfully, be readmitted after seven years, when the lawful\r\npenance has been accomplished; or after the space of five years if it was\r\nby chance; but if she should become ill during the appointed time, let her\r\nreceive the communion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSynod of Gangra, A. D. 343, _Canon_ 3, Bruns, I, 107.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one, under the pretence of piety, advises a slave to despise his\r\nmaster and run away from his service and not with good will and full\r\nrespect serve his master, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\nSynod of Agde, A. D. 509. _Canon_ 7, Bruns, II, 147.\r\n\r\n\r\n    As slaves were a valuable possession, bishops could no more\r\n    alienate them than any other property, or only under the same\r\n    conditions. This canon lays down principles generally followed in\r\n    the relation of the Church toward the unfree of every sort on\r\n    lands belonging to the endowments of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bishops should possess the houses and slaves of the Church in a\r\nfaithful manner and without diminishing the right of the Church, as the\r\nprimitive authorities direct, and also the vessels of their ministry as\r\nintrusted to them. That is, they should not presume to sell nor alienate\r\nby any contracts those things from which the poor live. If necessity\r\nrequires that something should be disposed of either as a usufruct(140) or\r\nin direct sale, let the case be first shown before two or three bishops of\r\nthe same province or neighborhood, as to why it is necessary to sell; and\r\nafter the priestly discussion has taken place, let the sale which was made\r\nbe confirmed by their subscription; otherwise the sale or transaction made\r\nshall not have validity. If the bishop bestows upon any deserving slaves\r\nof the Church their liberty, let the liberty that has been conferred be\r\nrespected by his successors, together with that which the manumitter gave\r\nthem when they were freed; and we command them to hold twenty solidi in\r\nvalue in fields, vineyards, and dwellings; what shall have been given more\r\nthe Church shall reclaim after the death of the one who manumitted.(141)\r\nBut little things and things of less utility to the Church we permit to be\r\ngiven to strangers and clergy for their usufruct, the right of the Church\r\nbeing maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Apostolic Constitutions_, IV, 6. (MSG, 1:812.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cruelty to slaves was placed upon the same moral level as cruelty\r\n    and oppression of other weak and defenceless people.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Apostolic Constitutions form an elaborate treatise upon the\r\n    Church and its organization in eight books, which appear,\r\n    according to the consensus of modern scholars, to belong to the\r\n    early part of the fifth century. The Apostolic Canons are\r\n    eighty-five canons appended to the eighth book.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the bishop ought to know whose oblations he ought to receive, and\r\nwhose he ought not. For he is to avoid corrupt dealers and not receive\r\ntheir gifts.… He is also to avoid those that oppress the widow and\r\noverbear the orphan, and fill the prisons with the innocent, and abuse\r\ntheir own slaves wickedly, I mean with stripes and hunger and hard\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Apostolic Canons_, _Canon_ 81, Bruns, I, 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This deals with the question of the ordination of a slave. Later,\r\n    if a slave was ordained without his master’s consent, the\r\n    ordination held, but the bishop was obliged to pay the price of\r\n    the slave to his master. _Cf._ Council of Orleans, A. D. 511,\r\n    _Can._ 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not permit slaves to be ordained to the clergy without their\r\nmasters’ consent; for this would wrong those that owned them. For such a\r\npractice would occasion the subversion of families. But if at any time a\r\nservant appears worthy to be ordained to a high office, such as Onesimus\r\nappears to have been, and if his master allows it, and gives him his\r\nfreedom, and dismisses him free from his house, let him be ordained.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Gregory the Great, _Ep. ad Montanam et Thomam_. (MSL, 77:803.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gregory and others approved of manumission of slaves as an act of\r\n    self-denial, for therein a man surrendered what belonged to him,\r\n    as in almsgiving; but he and others also justified the practice of\r\n    manumission upon lines that recall Stoic ideas of man’s natural\r\n    freedom. Yet, at the same time, Gregory could insist upon the\r\n    strict discipline of slaves in the administration of the Church\r\n    property.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following is a letter of manumission addressed apparently to a\r\n    man and his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince our Redeemer, the Maker of every creature, vouchsafed to assume\r\nhuman flesh for this end, that when by the grace of His divinity the chain\r\nof slavery wherewith we were held had been broken He might restore us to\r\nour pristine liberty, it is a salutary deed if men, whom nature originally\r\nproduced free, and whom the law of nations has subjected to the yoke of\r\nslavery, be restored by the benefit of manumission to the liberty in which\r\nthey were born. And so moved by loving-kindness and consideration of the\r\ncase, we make you Montana and Thomas, slaves of the holy Roman Church,\r\nwhich with the help of God we serve, free from this day and Roman\r\ncitizens, and we release to you all your private property.(142)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) _Codex Theodosianus_, XV, 12, 1; A. D. 325. _Cf._ Kirch, n. 754.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Constitution of Constantine regarding gladiatorial shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This edict was by no means enforced everywhere. In a shorter form\r\n    it passed into the _Cod. Just._ (XI, 44, 1), but only after the\r\n    edict of Honorius had stopped these shows.\r\n\r\n\r\nBloody spectacles are not pleasing in civil rest and domestic\r\ntranquillity. Wherefore we altogether prohibit them to be gladiators(143)\r\nwho, it may be, for their crimes have been accustomed to receive this\r\npenalty and sentence, and you shall cause them rather to serve in the\r\nmines, that without blood they may pay the penalty of their crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Theodoret, _Hist. Ec._, V, 26. (MSG, 82:1256.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHonorius, who had inherited the Empire of Europe, put a stop to\r\ngladiatorial combats, which had long been held in Rome, and he did this\r\nunder the following circumstances. There was a certain man named\r\nTelemachus who had embraced the ascetic life. He had set out for the East\r\nand for this reason had repaired to Rome. There, when the abominable\r\nspectacle was being exhibited, he went himself into the stadium, and\r\nstepping down into the arena endeavored to stop the men who were wielding\r\ntheir weapons against one another. The spectators of the slaughter were\r\nindignant and, inspired by the mad fury of the demon who delights in these\r\nbloody deeds, stoned the peacemaker to death. When the admirable Emperor\r\nwas informed of this he numbered Telemachus in the army of the victorious\r\nmartyrs, and put an end to that impious practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i_) Ambrose, _Ep. 51_. (MSL, 16:1210.) _Cf._ Kirch, nn. 754 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Letter to the Emperor Theodosius after the massacre at\r\n    Thessalonica in 390.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Emperor had ordered a general massacre of the inhabitants of\r\n    Thessalonica because of a sedition there. Ambrose wrote to him the\r\n    following letter after having pleaded in vain with him before the\r\n    massacre to deal mercifully with the people. (The well-known story\r\n    of the penitence of Theodosius may be found in Theodoret, _Hist.\r\n    Ec._, V, 17.) His residence at the seat of the imperial government\r\n    at that time, Milan, made him the chief adviser to the court in\r\n    spite of the fact that the Arian influence was strong at court, as\r\n    the empress mother Justina was an Arian, _cf._ Ambrose, _Ep._ 20,\r\n    21. (PNF, ser. II, vol. X.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Listen, august Emperor, I cannot deny that you have a zeal for the\r\nfaith; I confess that you have the fear of God. But you have a natural\r\nvehemence, which, if any one endeavors to soothe it, you quickly turn to\r\nmercy; and if any one stirs it up, you allow it to be roused so much that\r\nyou can scarcely restrain it. Would that it might be that, if no one\r\nsoothed it, at least no one inflamed it. To yourself I willingly intrust\r\nit, restrain yourself and overcome your natural vehemence by the love of\r\npiety.…\r\n\r\n6. There took place in the city of the Thessalonians that of which no\r\nmemory recalls the like, which I was not able to prevent taking place;\r\nwhich, indeed, I had before said, would be most atrocious when I so often\r\npetitioned concerning it(144) and which as you yourself show, by revoking\r\nit too late, you consider to be grave, and this I could not extenuate when\r\ncommitted.…\r\n\r\n\r\n    After citing from the Bible several cases of kings exhibiting\r\n    penance for sins, Ambrose continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n11. I have written this, not to confound you, but that the examples of\r\nkings may stir you up to put away this sin from your kingdom, for you will\r\nput it away by humbling your soul before God. You are a man, temptation\r\nhas come to you; conquer it. Sin is not done away but by tears and\r\npenitence. Neither angel can do it, nor archangel. The Lord himself, who\r\nalone can say “I am with you,” if we have sinned, does not forgive any but\r\nthose who do penance.\r\n\r\n12. I urge, I beg, I exhort, I warn; for it is grief to me that you who\r\nwere an example of unheard-of piety, who were conspicuous for clemency,\r\nwho would not suffer single offenders to be put in peril, should not mourn\r\nthat so many innocent persons have perished. Though you have waged war\r\nmost successfully, though in other matters too you are worthy of praise,\r\nyet piety was ever the crown of your actions. The devil envied that which\r\nyou had as a most excellent possession. Conquer him whilst you still\r\npossess that wherewith you can conquer. Do not add another sin to your sin\r\nby a course of action which has injured many.\r\n\r\n13. I, indeed, though a debtor to your kindness, for which I cannot be\r\nungrateful, that kindness which I regard as surpassing that of many\r\nemperors, and has been equalled by one only, I have no cause, I say, for a\r\ncharge of contumacy against you, but have cause for fear. I dare not offer\r\nthe sacrifice if you intend to be present. Is that which is not allowed\r\nafter the shedding of the blood of one innocent person allowed after the\r\nshedding of the blood of many? I think not.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_j_) _Codex Theodosianus_, III, 16, 2; A. D. 421.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The later Roman law of divorce.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Roman law under the Empire was extremely favorable to divorce,\r\n    making it easy for either party to become rid of the other for any\r\n    cause that seemed sufficient. The Christian Church from the first,\r\n    following the teaching of Christ, opposed divorce. Marriage was an\r\n    indissoluble relation; see § 39 _f_, _g_. It was only by degrees\r\n    that much change could be introduced into the civil law. The\r\n    following law of Theodosius II gives the condition of the law in\r\n    the fifth century. It shows that to some extent the Christian\r\n    principles regarding marriage had affected legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a woman leave her husband by a repudiation made by her and prove no\r\ncause for her divorcing him, the gifts which she received as bride shall\r\nbe taken away and she shall likewise be deprived of her dowry, and be\r\nsubjected to the punishment of deportation; and to her we deny not only\r\nthe right of marriage with another man, but also the right of\r\npost-liminium.(145) But if the woman opposed to the marriage prove faults\r\nof morals and vices, though of no great gravity, let her lose her dowry\r\nand pay back to her husband her marriage gift, and let her never join\r\nherself in marriage with another; that she may not stain her widowhood\r\nwith the impudence of unchastity we give the repudiated husband the right\r\nof bringing an accusation by law. Hereafter if she who abandons her\r\nhusband prove grave causes and a guilt involving great crimes, let her\r\nobtain a control of her dowry and marriage gifts, and five years after the\r\nday of repudiation she shall receive the right of remarrying; for it would\r\nthen appear that she had acted rather out of detestation of her husband\r\nthan from desire after another. Likewise, if the husband bring a divorce\r\nand charge grave crimes against the woman, let him bring action against\r\nthe accused under the laws and let him both have the dowry (sentence\r\nhaving been obtained) and let him receive his gifts to her and let the\r\nfree choice of marrying another be granted him immediately. But if it is\r\nan offence of manners and not of a criminal nature, let him receive the\r\ndonations, relinquish the dowry, and marry after two years. But if he\r\nmerely wishes to dissolve the marriage by dissent, and she who is put away\r\nis charged with no fault or sin, let the man lose the donation and the\r\ndowry, and in perpetual celibacy let him bear as a penalty for his\r\nwrongful divorce the pain of solitude; to the woman, however, is conceded\r\nafter a year the right to remarry. Regarding the retention of the dowry on\r\naccount of the children we command that the directions of the old law\r\nshall be observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_k_) Jerome, _Epistula_ 78, _ad Oceanum_. (MSL, 22:691.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Divorce and remarriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The principle here laid down by Jerome was that which ultimately\r\n    prevailed in the Church of the West, that after divorce there\r\n    could be no remarriage, inasmuch as the marriage bond was\r\n    indissoluble, though the parties might be separated by the law.\r\n    But another principle was also made a part of the code of\r\n    Christian morality, that what was forbidden a woman was also\r\n    forbidden a man, _i.e._, the moral code as to chastity was the\r\n    same for both sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. The Lord hath commanded that a wife should not be put away except for\r\nfornication; and that when she has been put away, she ought to remain\r\nunmarried [Matt. 19:9; I Cor. 7:11]. Whatever is given as a commandment to\r\nmen logically applies to women also. For it cannot be that while an\r\nadulterous wife is to be put away, an incontinent husband must be\r\nretained.… The laws of Cæsar are different, it is true, from the laws of\r\nChrist. Papinian commands one thing; our Paul another.(146) Among them the\r\nbridles are loosened for immodesty in the case of men. But with us what is\r\nunlawful for women is equally unlawful for men; and both are bound by the\r\nsame conditions of service. She(147) then put away, as they report, a\r\nhusband that was a sinner; she put away one who was guilty of this and\r\nthat crime.… She was a young woman; she could not preserve her widowhood.…\r\nShe persuaded herself and thought that her husband had been lawfully put\r\naway from her. She did not know that the strictness of the Gospel takes\r\naway from women all pretexts for remarriage, so long as their former\r\nhusbands are alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_l_) Jerome, _Adversus Jovinianum_, I, 7. (MSL, 23:229.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The inferiority of marriage to virginity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    While the Church teachers insisted on the indissolubility of\r\n    marriage and its sanctity, in not a few cases they depreciated\r\n    marriage. Of those who did this Jerome may be regarded as the most\r\n    characteristic and representative of a tendency which had set in,\r\n    largely in connection with the increase of monasticism, regarded\r\n    as the only form of Christian perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is good for a man not to touch a woman.”(148) If it is good not to\r\ntouch a woman, it is bad to touch one; for nothing is opposed to goodness\r\nbut the bad. But if it be bad and the evil is pardoned, it is conceded\r\nthat a worse evil may not happen. But what sort of good is that which is\r\nallowed only because there may be something worse? He would have never\r\nadded, “Let each man have his own wife,” unless he had previously said,\r\n“But because of fornication.”… “Defraud ye not one another, except it be\r\nby consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer.” What, I\r\npray, is the quality of that good thing which hinders prayer, which does\r\nnot allow the body of Christ to be received? So long as I do a husband’s\r\npart, I fail in continency. The same Apostle in another place commands us\r\nto pray always.(149)\r\n\r\n9. “It is better to marry than to burn.” If marriage itself be good, do\r\nnot compare it with fire, but simply say, “It is good to marry.” I suspect\r\nthe goodness of that thing which must be only the lesser of two evils.\r\nWhat I want is not the smaller evil, but a thing that is absolutely good.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_m_) Chrysostom, _Hom._ 66 _in Matth._ (XX, 30). (MSG, 58:630.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Church took the lead in philanthropy and not only organized\r\n    relief of poor but constantly exhorted people to contribute to the\r\n    cause. See above, § 68, _d_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf both the wealthy and those next to them in wealth were to distribute\r\namong themselves those in need of bread and raiment, scarcely would one\r\npoor person fall to the share of fifty men, or even a hundred. Yet,\r\nnevertheless, though in such great abundance of persons able to assist\r\nthem, they are wailing every day. And that thou mayest learn their\r\ninhumanity, recall that the Church(150) has a revenue of one of the lowest\r\namong the wealthy, and not of the very rich; and consider how many widows\r\nit succors every day, how many virgins; for indeed the list of them\r\namounts to the number of three thousand. Together with these she succors\r\nthem that dwell in prison, the sick in the caravansaries, the healthy,\r\nthose that are absent from their homes, those that are maimed in their\r\nbodies, those that wait upon the altar; and with respect to food and\r\nraiment, those that casually come every day; and her substance is in no\r\nrespect diminished. So that if ten men only were thus willing to spend,\r\nthere would be no poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_n_) Gregory of Nazianzus, _Panegyric on Basil_, ch. 63. (MSG, 36:577.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gregory of Nazianzus was the friend and schoolmate of Basil. The\r\n    action of Basil in forcing upon him the bishopric of Sasima led to\r\n    an estrangement and brought about the tragedy of Gregory’s\r\n    ecclesiastical career, his forced resignation of the\r\n    archiepiscopal see of Constantinople. See Gregory’s oration, “The\r\n    Last Farewell” (PNF, ser. II, vol. VII, 385). Nevertheless, the\r\n    death of Basil was an occasion for him to deliver his greatest\r\n    oration. It was probably composed and delivered several years\r\n    after Basil’s decease and after Gregory had retired from\r\n    Constantinople to his home at Nazianzus.\r\n\r\n\r\nGo forth a little way from the city, behold the New City,(151) the\r\nstorehouse of piety … where disease is regarded in a philosophic light,\r\nand disaster is thought to be a blessing in disguise, and sympathy is\r\ntested. Why should I compare with this work Thebes having the seven gates,\r\nand the Egyptian Thebes and the walls of Babylon … and all other objects\r\nof men’s wonder and of historic record, from all of which, except for some\r\nslight glory, there was no advantage to their founders? My subject is the\r\nmost wonderful of all, the short road to salvation, the easiest ascent to\r\nheaven.(152) There is no longer before our eyes that terrible and piteous\r\nspectacle of men dead before their death, in many members of their body\r\nalready dead, driven away from their cities and homes and public places\r\nand fountains, ay and from their dearest ones, recognizable by their names\r\nrather than by their features.… He, however, it was who most of all\r\npersuaded us men, as being men, not to despise men nor to dishonor Christ,\r\nthe head of all, by inhuman treatment of them; but in the misfortune of\r\nothers to establish well our own lot and to lend to God that mercy, since\r\nwe ourselves need mercy. He did not therefore disdain to honor disease\r\nwith his lips; he was noble and of noble ancestry and of brilliant\r\nreputation, but he saluted them as brethren, not out of vainglory, as some\r\nmight suppose (for who was so far removed from this feeling?), but taking\r\nthe lead in approaching to tend them in consequence of his philosophy, and\r\nso giving not only a speaking but also a silent instruction. Not only the\r\ncity, but the country and parts beyond behave in like manner; and even the\r\nleaders of society have vied with one another in their philanthropy and\r\nmagnanimity toward them.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 76. Popular Piety and the Reception of Heathenism in the Church\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen vast numbers poured into the Church in the fourth century and the\r\nprofession of Christianity no longer involved danger, morals became less\r\naustere, and the type of piety became adapted to the religious condition\r\nof those with whom the Church had now to deal. This is shown in the new\r\nplace that the intercession of saints and the veneration of their relics\r\ntake in the religious life of the times. Yet these and similar forms of\r\ndevotion in popular piety were not new and cannot be attributed in\r\nprinciple to any wholesale importation of heathenism into the Church, as\r\nwas charged at the time and often since. In principle, and to some extent\r\nin practice, they can be traced to times of persecution and danger. But,\r\non the other hand, no little heathenism was brought into the Church by\r\nthose who came into it without any adequate preparation or real change of\r\nreligious feeling. With this heathenism the Church had to struggle, either\r\ncasting it out in whole or in part, or rendering it as innocuous as\r\npossible. In spite of all, many heathen superstitions remained everywhere\r\nin Christendom, though playing for the most part such an inferior rôle as\r\nto be negligible in the total effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Eusebius, _Vita Constantini_ (PNF),\r\n    III, 21, 28; IV, 38, 39, 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Ambrose, _De Viduis_, ch. 9. (MSL, 16:264.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The importance and value of calling upon the saints for their\r\n    intercessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with violent fever, Peter and\r\nAndrew besought the Lord for her: “And He stood over her and commanded the\r\nfever and it left her, and immediately she arose and ministered unto\r\nthem.”…\r\n\r\nSo Peter and Andrew prayed for the widow. Would that there were some one\r\nwho could so quickly pray for us, or better still, they who prayed for the\r\nmother-in-law—Peter and Andrew his brother. Then they could pray for one\r\nrelated to them, now they are able to pray for us and for all. For you see\r\nthat one bound by great sin is less fit to pray for herself, certainly\r\nless likely to obtain for herself. Let her then make use of others to pray\r\nfor her to the Physician. For the sick, unless the Physician be called to\r\nthem by the prayers of others, cannot pray for themselves. The flesh is\r\nweak, the soul is sick and hindered by the chains of sins, and cannot\r\ndirect its feeble steps to the throne of that great Physician. The angels\r\nmust be entreated for us, who have been to us as guardians; the martyrs\r\nmust be entreated whose patronage we seem to claim by a sort of pledge,\r\nthe possession of their body. They can entreat for our sins, who, if they\r\nhad any sins, washed them in their own blood; for they are the martyrs of\r\nGod, our leaders, the beholders of our life and of our actions. Let us not\r\nbe ashamed to take them as intercessors for our weakness, for they\r\nthemselves knew the weakness of the body, even when they overcame.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Jerome, _Contra Vigilantium_, chs. 4 _ff._ (MSL, 23:357.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    A defence of the worship and practice of the Church, especially in\r\n    regard to veneration of relics against the criticism of\r\n    Vigilantius.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Jerome’s attack on Vigilantius is in many respects a masterpiece\r\n    of scurrility, and unworthy of the ability of the man. But it is\r\n    invaluable as a statement of the opinions of the times regarding\r\n    such matters as the veneration of relics, the attitude toward the\r\n    departed saints and martyrs, and many other elements of the\r\n    popular religion which have been commonly attributed to a much\r\n    later period.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 4. Among other words of blasphemy he [Vigilantius] may be heard to\r\nsay: “What need is there for you not only to reverence with so great honor\r\nbut even to adore I know not what, which you carry about in a little\r\nvessel and worship?” And again in the same book, “Why do you adore by\r\nkissing a bit of powder wrapped up in a cloth?” and further on, “Under the\r\ncloak of religion we see really a heathen ceremony introduced into the\r\nchurches; while the sun is shining heaps of tapers are lighted, and\r\neverywhere I know not what paltry bit of powder wrapped in a costly cloth\r\nis kissed and worshipped. Great honor do men of this sort pay to the\r\nblessed martyrs, who, as they think, are to be glorified by trumpery\r\ntapers, but to whom the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne, with all\r\nthe brightness of His majesty gives light.”\r\n\r\nCh. 5. … Is the Emperor Arcadius guilty of sacrilege, who, after so long a\r\ntime, conveyed the bones of the blessed Samuel from Judæa to Thrace? Are\r\nall the bishops to be considered not only sacrilegious but silly as well,\r\nwho carried that most worthless thing, dust and ashes, wrapped in silk and\r\nin a golden vessel? Are the people of all the churches fools, who went to\r\nmeet the sacred relics, and received them with as much joy as if they\r\nbeheld the living prophet in the midst of them, so that there was one\r\ngreat swarm of people from Palestine to Chalcedon and with one voice the\r\npraises of Christ resounded?…\r\n\r\nCh. 6. For you say that the souls of the Apostles and martyrs have their\r\nabode either in the bosom of Abraham, or in some place of refreshment, or\r\nunder the altar of God, and that they cannot leave their own tombs and be\r\npresent where they will. They are, it seems, of senatorial rank and are\r\nnot in the worst sort of prison and among murderers, but are kept apart in\r\nliberal and honorable custody in the isles of the blessed and the Elysian\r\nfields. Do you lay down laws for God? Will you throw the Apostles in\r\nchains? So that to the day of judgment they are to be kept in confinement\r\nand are not with the Lord, although it is written concerning them, “They\r\nfollow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth.” If the Lamb is present\r\neverywhere, then they who are with the Lamb, it must be believed, are\r\neverywhere. And while the devil and the demons wander through the whole\r\nworld, and with only too great speed are present everywhere, the martyrs\r\nafter shedding their blood are to be kept out of sight shut up in a\r\ncoffin(153) from whence they cannot go forth? You say in your pamphlet\r\nthat so long as we are alive we can pray for one another; but after we are\r\ndead the prayer of no person for another can be heard, and especially\r\nbecause the martyrs, though they cry for the avenging of their blood, have\r\nnever been able to obtain their request. If Apostles and martyrs, while\r\nstill in the body, can pray for others, when they ought still to be\r\nanxious for themselves, how much more must they do so after they have\r\ntheir crowns and victories and triumphs? A single man, Moses, won pardon\r\nfrom God for six hundred thousand armed men; and Stephen, the follower of\r\nhis Lord and the first martyr for Christ, entreats pardon for his\r\npersecutors; and after they have entered on their life with Christ, shall\r\nthey have less power? The Apostle Paul says that two hundred and\r\nseventy-six souls were given him in the ship; and after his dissolution,\r\nwhen he began to be with Christ, must he then shut up his mouth and be\r\nunable to say a word for those who throughout the whole world have\r\nbelieved in his Gospel? Shall Vigilantius the live dog be better than Paul\r\nthe dead lion?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Council of Laodicæa, A. D. 343-381, _Canons_ 35. _f._, Bruns, I, 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Council of Laodicæa is of uncertain date, but its earliest\r\n    possible date is 343 and the latest 381, _i.e._, between the\r\n    Councils of Sardica and Constantinople. See Hefele, § 93. It owes\r\n    its importance not to any immediate effect it had upon the course\r\n    of the Church’s development, but to the fact that its canons were\r\n    incorporated in collections and received approval, possibly at\r\n    Chalcedon, A. D. 451, though not mentioned by name in Canon 1, and\r\n    certainly at the Quinisext, A. D. 692, Canon 2. In the West the\r\n    canons were of importance as having been used by Dionysius Exiguus\r\n    in his collection. That the Canon of Holy Scripture was settled at\r\n    this council is a traditional commonplace in theology, but hardly\r\n    borne out by the facts. The council only drew up one of the\r\n    several imperfect lists of sacred books which appeared in\r\n    antiquity. The following canons show the influx of heathenism into\r\n    the Church, resulting from the changed status of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 35. Christians must not forsake the Church of God and go away and\r\ninvoke angels and gather assemblies, which things are forbidden. If,\r\ntherefore, any one shall be found engaged in secret idolatry, let him be\r\nanathema; for he has forsaken our Lord Jesus Christ and gone over to\r\nidolatry.\r\n\r\nCanon 36. They who are of the priesthood and of the lower clergy shall not\r\nbe magicians, enchanters, mathematicians(154) nor astrologers; nor shall\r\nthey make amulets, which are chains for their own souls. And those who\r\nwear such we command to be cast out of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Augustine, _Epistula_ 29. (MSL, 33:117.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Heathenism in the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n    An Epistle of Augustine, written when Augustine was still a\r\n    presbyter of Hippo, concerning the birthday of Leontius, formerly\r\n    bishop of Hippo. In it he tells Alypius that he had at length put\r\n    an end to the custom among the Catholics of Hippo of taking part\r\n    in splendid banquets on the birthday of saints, as was then the\r\n    custom in the African churches.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 8. When the day dawned on which they were accustomed to prepare\r\nthemselves for excess in eating and drinking, I received notice that some,\r\neven of those who were present at my sermon, had not yet ceased\r\ncomplaining, and that so great was the power of detestable custom among\r\nthem that, using no other argument, they asked: “Wherefore is this now\r\nprohibited? Were they not Christians who in former times did not interfere\r\nwith this practice?”…\r\n\r\nCh. 9. Lest, however, any slight should seem to be put by us upon those\r\nwho before our time either tolerated or dared not put down such manifest\r\nwrong-doings of an undisciplined multitude, I explained to them the\r\nnecessity by which this custom seems to have arisen in the Church; namely,\r\nthat when, in the peace which came after such numerous and violent\r\npersecutions, crowds of heathen who wished to assume the Christian\r\nreligion were kept back because, having been accustomed to celebrate the\r\nfeasts connected with idols in revelling and drunkenness, they could not\r\neasily refrain from these pleasures so hurtful and so habitual; and it\r\nseemed good to our ancestors that for a time a concession should be made\r\nto this infirmity, that after they had renounced the former festivals they\r\nmight celebrate other feasts, in honor of the holy martyrs, which were\r\nobserved, not with the same profane design, although with similar\r\nindulgence. Now upon them as persons bound together in the name of Christ,\r\nand submissive to the yoke of His august authority, the wholesome\r\nrestraints of sobriety were laid; and these restraints, on account of the\r\nhonor and fear of Him who appointed them they might not resist; and that\r\ntherefore it was now time that those who did not dare to deny that they\r\nwere Christians should begin to live according to Christ’s will; being now\r\nChristians they should reject those things conceded that they might become\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 77. The Extension of Monasticism Throughout the Empire\r\n\r\n\r\nAsceticism arose within the Christian Church partly as the practical\r\nexpression of the conviction of the worthlessness of things transitory and\r\npartly as a reaction against the moral laxity of the times. As this laxity\r\ncould not be kept entirely out of the Church, and Christians everywhere\r\nwere exposed to it, those who sought the higher life felt the necessity of\r\nretirement. From the life of the isolated hermit, asceticism advanced\r\nnaturally to the community type of the ascetic life. There were\r\nforerunners in non-Christian religions of the solitary ascetic and the\r\ncenobite in Egypt, Palestine, India, and elsewhere, but all the essentials\r\nof Christian monasticism can be adequately explained without employing the\r\ntheory of borrowing or imitation. For the principal points of development,\r\n_v._ §§ 53, 78, 104. When monasticism had once made itself a strong factor\r\nin the Christian religious life of Egypt, it was quickly taken up by other\r\nparts of the Church as it satisfied a widely felt want. In Asia Minor\r\nBasil of Cæsarea was the great promoter and organizer of the ascetic life;\r\nand his rule still obtains throughout the East. In the West Athanasius\r\nappears to have introduced monastic ideas during his early exiles. Ambrose\r\nwas a patron of the movement. Martin of Tours, Severinus, and John Cassian\r\ndid much to extend it in Gaul. Augustine organized his clergy according to\r\na monastic rule which ultimately played a large part in later monasticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Palladius, _Historia Lausiaca_, ch. 38. (MSG, 34:1099.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Rule of Pachomius.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Palladius, the author of the history of monasticism, known as the\r\n    _Historia Lausiaca_, was an Origenist, pupil of Evagrius Ponticus,\r\n    and later bishop in Asia Minor. He is not to be confused with\r\n    Palladius of Helenopolis, who lived about the same time, in the\r\n    first part of the fifth century. The work of Palladius receives\r\n    its name from the fact that it is dedicated to a high official,\r\n    Lausus by name. Palladius made a careful study of monasticism,\r\n    travelling extensively in making researches for his work. He also\r\n    used what written material was available. It is probable that the\r\n    text is largely interpolated, but on the whole it is a trustworthy\r\n    account of the early monasticism. It was written about A. D. 420,\r\n    and the following account of Pachomius should be compared with\r\n    that of Sozomenus, _Hist. Ec._, III, 14, written some years later.\r\n    Text in Kirch, nn. 712 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a place in the Thebaid called Tabenna, in which lived a certain\r\nmonk Pachomius, one of those men who have attained the highest form of\r\nlife, so that he was granted predictions of the future and angelic\r\nvisions. He was a great lover of the poor, and had great love to men.\r\nWhen, therefore, he was sitting in a cave an angel of the Lord came in and\r\nappeared to him and said: Pachomius you have done well those things which\r\npertain to your own affairs; therefore sit no longer idle in this cave.\r\nUp, therefore, go forth and gather all the younger monks and dwell with\r\nthem and give them laws according to the form which I give thee. And he\r\ngave him a brass tablet on which the following things were written:\r\n\r\n1. Give to each to eat and drink according to his strength; and give\r\nlabors according to the powers of those eating, and forbid neither fasting\r\nnor eating. Thus appoint difficult labors to the stronger and those who\r\neat, but the lighter and easy tasks to those who discipline themselves\r\nmore and are weaker.\r\n\r\n2. Make separate cells in the same place; and let three remain in a cell.\r\nBut let the food of all be prepared in one house.\r\n\r\n3. They may not sleep lying down, but having made seats built inclining\r\nbackward let them place their bedding on them and sleep seated.\r\n\r\n4. But by night let them wear linen tunics, being girded about. Let each\r\nof them have a shaggy goatskin, made white. Without this let them neither\r\neat nor sleep. When they go in unto the communion of the mysteries of\r\nChrist every Sabbath and Lord’s Day, let them loose their girdles and put\r\noff the goatskin, and enter with only their cuculla [_cf._ DCA]. But he\r\nmade the cuculla for them without any fleece, as for boys; and he\r\ncommanded to place upon them certain branding marks of a purple cross.\r\n\r\n5. He commanded that there be twenty-four groups of the brethren,\r\naccording to the number of the twenty-four letters. And he prescribed that\r\nto each group should be given as a name a letter of the Greek alphabet,\r\nfrom Alpha and Beta, one after another, to Omega, in order that when the\r\narchimandrite asked for any one in so great a company, that one may be\r\nasked who is the second in each, how group Alpha is, or how the group\r\nBeta; again let him salute the group Rho; the name of the letters\r\nfollowing its own proper sign. And upon the simpler and more guileless\r\nplace the name Iota; and upon those who are more ill-tempered and less\r\nrighteous the letter Xi. And thus in harmony with the principles and the\r\nlife and manners of them arrange the names of the letters, only the\r\nspiritual understanding the meaning.\r\n\r\n6. There was written on the tablet that if there come a stranger of\r\nanother monastery, having a different form of life, he shall not eat nor\r\ndrink with them, nor go in with them into the monastery, unless he shall\r\nbe found in the way outside of the monastery.\r\n\r\n7. But do not receive for three years into the contest of proficients him\r\nwho has entered once for all to remain with them; but when he has\r\nperformed the more difficult tasks, then let him after a period of three\r\nyears enter the stadium.\r\n\r\n8. When they eat let them veil their faces, that one brother may not see\r\nanother brother eating. They are not to speak while they eat; nor outside\r\nof their dish or off the table shall they turn their eyes toward anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n9. And he made it a rule that during the whole day they should offer\r\ntwelve prayers; and at the time of lighting the lamps, twelve; and in the\r\ncourse of the night, twelve; and at the ninth hour, three; but when it\r\nseemed good for the whole company to eat, he directed that each group\r\nshould first sing a psalm at each prayer.\r\n\r\nBut when the great Pachomius replied to the angel that the prayers were\r\nfew, the angel said to him: I have appointed these that the little ones\r\nmay advance and fulfil the law and not be distressed; but the perfect do\r\nnot need to have laws given to them. For being by themselves in their\r\ncells, they have dedicated their entire life to contemplation on God. But\r\nto these, as many as do not have an intelligent mind, I will give a law\r\nthat as saucy servants out of fear for the Master they may fulfil the\r\nwhole order of life and direct it properly. When the angel had given these\r\ndirections and fulfilled his ministry he departed from the great\r\nPachomius. There are monasteries observing this rule, composed of seven\r\nthousand men, but the first and great monastery, wherein the blessed\r\nPachomius dwelt, and which gave birth to the other places of asceticism,\r\nhas one thousand three hundred men.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Basil the Great, _Regula fusius tractata_, Questio 7. (MSG, 31:927.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Rule of St. Basil is composed in the form of question and\r\n    answer, and in place of setting down a simple, clearly stated law,\r\n    with perhaps some little exhortation, goes into much detailed\r\n    argument, even in the briefer Rule. In the following passage Basil\r\n    points out the advantages of the cenobitic life over the solitary\r\n    or hermit life. It is condensed as indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestio VII. Since your words have given us full assurance that the life\r\n[_i.e._, the cenobitic life] is dangerous with those who despise the\r\ncommandments of the Lord, we wish accordingly to learn whether it is\r\nnecessary that he who withdraws should remain alone or live with brothers\r\nof like mind who have placed before themselves the same goal of piety.\r\n\r\n_Responsio_ 1. I think that the life of several in the same place is much\r\nmore profitable. First, because for bodily wants no one of us is\r\nsufficient for himself, but we need each other in providing what is\r\nnecessary. For just as the foot has one ability, but is wanting another,\r\nand without the help of the other members it would find neither its own\r\npower strong nor sufficient of itself to continue, nor any supply for what\r\nit lacks, so it is in the case of the solitary life: what is of use to us\r\nand what is wanting we cannot provide for ourselves, for God who created\r\nthe world has so ordered all things that we are dependent upon each other,\r\nas it is written that we may join ourselves to one another [_cf._ Wis.\r\n13:20]. But in addition to this, reverence to the love of Christ does not\r\npermit each one to have regard only to his own affairs, for love, he says,\r\nseeks not her own [I Cor. 13:5]. The solitary life has only one goal, the\r\nservice of its own interests. That clearly is opposed to the law of love,\r\nwhich the Apostle fulfilled, when he did not in his eyes seek his own\r\nadvantage but the advantage of many, that they might be saved [_cf._ I\r\nCor. 10:33]. Further, no one in solitude recognizes his own defects, since\r\nhe has no one to correct him and in gentleness and mercy direct him on his\r\nway. For even if correction is from an enemy, it may often in the case of\r\nthose who are well disposed rouse the desire for healing; but the healing\r\nof sin by him who sincerely loves is wisely accomplished.… Also the\r\ncommands may be better fulfilled by a larger community, but not by one\r\nalone; for while this thing is being done another will be neglected; for\r\nexample, by attendance upon the sick the reception of strangers is\r\nneglected; and in the bestowal and distribution of the necessities of life\r\n(especially when in these services much time is consumed) the care of the\r\nwork is neglected, so that by this the greatest commandment and the one\r\nmost helpful to salvation is neglected; neither the hungry are fed nor the\r\nnaked clothed. Who would therefore value higher the idle, useless life\r\nthan the fruitful which fulfils the commandments of God?\r\n\r\n3. … Also in the preservation of the gifts bestowed by God the cenobitic\r\nlife is preferable.… For him who falls into sin, the recovery of the right\r\npath is so much easier, for he is ashamed at the blame expressed by so\r\nmany in common, so that it happens to him as it is written: It is enough\r\nthat the same therefore be punished by many [II Cor. 2:6].… There are\r\nstill other dangers which we say accompany the solitary life, the first\r\nand greatest is that of self-satisfaction. For he who has no one to test\r\nhis work easily believes that he has completely fulfilled the\r\ncommandments.…\r\n\r\n4. For how shall he manifest his humility, when he has no one to whom he\r\ncan show himself the inferior? How shall he manifest compassion, cut off\r\nfrom the society of many? How will he exercise himself in patience, if no\r\none opposes his wishes?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Council of Chalcedon, A. D. 451, _Canon_ 4. Bruns, I, 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The subjection of the monastery and the monks to the bishop.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Asceticism of the solitary life was apart from the organization of\r\n    the Church; when this form of life had developed in cenobitism it\r\n    still remained for a time, at least, outside the ecclesiastical\r\n    organization. Athanasius, who was a patron of the monastic life\r\n    and often found support and refuge among the monks, did much to\r\n    bring Egyptian monasticism back to the Church, and in the fifth\r\n    century monks became a great power in ecclesiastical affairs,\r\n    _cf._ the Origenistic controversy, _v. infra_, § 88. Basil, at\r\n    once archbishop of Cæsarea and leading exponent of monastic ideas,\r\n    brought the two to some extent together. But always the episcopal\r\n    control was only with difficulty brought to bear on the monastic\r\n    life, and in the West this opposition of the two religious forces\r\n    ultimately became embodied in the principle of monastic exemption.\r\n    The Council of Chalcedon, in 451, aimed to correct the early abuse\r\n    by placing the monasteries under the control of the bishop.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey who lead a true and worthy monastic life shall enjoy the honor that\r\nbelongs to them. But since there are some who assume the monastic\r\ncondition only as a pretence, and will upset the ecclesiastical and civil\r\nregulations and affairs, and run about without distinction in the cities\r\nand want to found cloisters for themselves, the synod therefore has\r\ndecreed that no one shall build a cloister or house of prayer or erect\r\nanywhere without the consent of the bishop of the city; and further, that\r\nalso the monks of every district and city shall be subject to the bishop,\r\nthat they shall love peace and quiet and observe the fasts and prayers in\r\nthe places where they are assigned continually; that they shall not cumber\r\nthemselves with ecclesiastical and secular business and shall not take\r\npart in such; they shall not leave their cloisters except when in cases of\r\nnecessity they may be commissioned by the bishop of the city with such;\r\nthat no slave shall be admitted into the cloister in order to become a\r\nmonk without the permission of his master. Whoever violates this our order\r\nshall be excommunicated, that the name of God be not blasphemed. The\r\nbishop of the city must keep a careful oversight of the cloisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Jerome, _Epistula_ 127, _ad Principiam_. (MSL, 22:1087.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The introduction of monasticism into the West during the Arian\r\n    controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. At that time no high-born lady at Rome knew of the profession of the\r\nmonastic life, neither would she have dared, on account of the novelty,\r\npublicly to assume a name that was regarded as ignominious and vile. It\r\nwas from some priests of Alexandria and from Pope Athanasius(155) and\r\nsubsequently from Peter,(156) who, to escape the persecution of the Arian\r\nheretics, had fled for refuge to Rome as the safest haven of their\r\ncommunion—it was from these that she [Marcella] learned of the life of the\r\nblessed Anthony, then still living, and of the monasteries in the Thebaid,\r\nfounded by Pachomius, and of the discipline of virgins and widows. Nor was\r\nshe ashamed to profess what she knew was pleasing to Christ. Many years\r\nafter her example was followed first by Sophronia and then by others.… The\r\nrevered Paula enjoyed Marcella’s friendship, and it was in her cell that\r\nEustochium, that ornament of virginity, was trained.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Augustine, _Confessiones_, VIII, ch. 6. (MSL, 32:755.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The extension of monasticism in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon a certain day … there came to the house to see Alypius and me,\r\nPontitianus, a countryman of ours, in so far as he was an African, who\r\nheld high office in the Emperor’s court. What he wanted with us I know\r\nnot. We sat down to talk together, and upon the table before us, used for\r\ngames, he noticed by chance a book; he took it up, opened it, and,\r\ncontrary to his expectations, found it to be the Apostle Paul, for he\r\nimagined it to be one of those books the teaching of which was wearing me\r\nout. At this he looked up at me smilingly, and expressed his delight and\r\nwonder that he so unexpectedly found this book, and this only, before my\r\neyes. For he was both a Christian and baptized, and in constant and daily\r\nprayers he often prostrated himself before Thee our God in the Church.\r\nWhen, then, I had told him that I bestowed much pains upon these writings,\r\na conversation ensued on his speaking of Anthony, the Egyptian monk, whose\r\nname was in high repute among Thy servants, though up to that time\r\nunfamiliar to us. When he came to know this he lingered on that topic,\r\nimparting to us who were ignorant a knowledge of this man so eminent, and\r\nmarvelling at our ignorance. But we were amazed, hearing Thy wonderful\r\nworks most fully manifested in times so recent, and almost in our own,\r\nwrought in the true faith and the Catholic Church. We all wondered—we that\r\nthey were so great, and he that we had never heard of them.\r\n\r\nFrom this his conversation turned to the companies in the monasteries, and\r\ntheir manners so fragrant unto Thee, and of the fruitful deserts of the\r\nwilderness, of which we knew nothing. And there was a monastery at Milan\r\nfull of good brethren, without the walls of the city, under the care of\r\nAmbrose, and we were ignorant of it. He went on with his relation, and we\r\nlistened intently and in silence. He then related to us how on a certain\r\nafternoon, at Treves, when the Emperor was taken up with seeing the\r\nCircensian games, he and three others, his comrades, went out for a walk\r\nin the gardens close to the city walls, and there, as they chanced to walk\r\ntwo and two, one strolled away with him, while the other two went by\r\nthemselves; and these in their ramblings came upon a certain cottage where\r\ndwelt some of Thy servants, “poor in spirit,” of whom “is the kingdom of\r\nheaven,” and they found there a book in which was written the life of\r\nAnthony. This one of them began to read, marvel at, and be inflamed by it;\r\nand in the reading to meditate on embracing such a life, and giving up his\r\nworldly employments to serve Thee.… Then Pontitianus, and he that had\r\nwalked with him through other parts of the garden, came in search of them\r\nto the same place, and, having found them, advised them to return as the\r\nday had declined.… But the other two, setting their affections upon\r\nheavenly things, remained in the cottage. And both of them had affianced\r\nbrides who also, when they heard of this, dedicated their virginity to\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Sulpicius Severus, _Life of St. Martin of Tours_, ch. 10. (MSL,\r\n20:166.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Monasticism in Gaul.\r\n\r\n\r\n    St. Martin, bishop of Tours, was born 316, became bishop of Tours\r\n    in 371, and died 396. He was the most considerable figure in the\r\n    Church life of Gaul at that time. Sulpicius Severus was his\r\n    disciple and enthusiastic biographer. For John Cassian and his\r\n    works on monasticism, see PNF, ser. II, vol. XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now having entered upon the episcopal office, it is beyond my power to\r\nset forth how well and how much he [Martin] performed. For he remained\r\nwith the utmost constancy the same as he had been before. In his heart\r\nthere was the same humility and in his garments the same simplicity; and\r\nso full of dignity and courtesy, he maintained the dignity of a bishop,\r\nyet so as not to lay aside the objects and virtues of a monk. Accordingly\r\nhe made use for some time of the cell connected with the church; but\r\nafterward, when he felt it impossible to tolerate the disturbance of the\r\nnumbers of those visiting it, he established a monastery for himself about\r\ntwo miles outside the city. This spot was so secret and retired that he\r\ndid not desire the solitude of a hermit. For, on one side, it was\r\nsurrounded by a precipitous rock of a lofty mountain; while the river\r\nLoire has shut in the rest of the plain by a bend extending back for a\r\ndistance. The place could be approached by only one passage, and that very\r\nnarrow. Here, then, he possessed a cell constructed of wood; many also of\r\nthe brethren had, in the same manner, fashioned retreats for themselves,\r\nbut most of them had formed these out of the rock of the overhanging\r\nmountain, hollowed out into caves. There were altogether eighty disciples,\r\nwho were being disciplined after the example of the saintly master. No one\r\nthere had anything which was called his own; all things were possessed in\r\ncommon. It was not allowed either to buy or sell anything, as is the\r\ncustom amongst most monks. No art was practised there except that of\r\ntranscribers, and even to this the more youthful were assigned, while the\r\nelders spent their time in prayer. Rarely did any of them go beyond the\r\ncell unless when they assembled at the place of prayer. They all took\r\ntheir food together after the hour of fasting was past. No one used wine\r\nexcept when illness compelled him. Most of them were dressed in garments\r\nof camel’s hair. Any dress approaching softness was there deemed criminal,\r\nand this must be thought the more remarkable because many among them were\r\nsuch as are deemed of noble rank, who though very differently brought up\r\nhad forced themselves down to this degree of humility and patience, and we\r\nhave seen many of these afterward as bishops. For what city or church\r\ncould there be that would not desire to have its priest from the monastery\r\nof Martin?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 78. Celibacy of the Clergy and the Regulation of Clerical Marriage\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insistence upon clerical celibacy and even the mere regulation of the\r\nmarriage of the clergy contributed not a little to making a clear\r\ndistinction between the clergy and the laity which became a marked feature\r\nin the constitution of the Church. The East and the West have always\r\ndiffered as to clerical marriage. In the East the parish clergy have\r\nalways been married; the bishops formerly married have long since been\r\nexclusively of the unmarried clergy. The clergy who do not marry become\r\nmonks. This seems to have been the solution of practical difficulties\r\nwhich were found to arise in that part of the Church in connection with\r\ngeneral clerical celibacy. In the West the celibacy of the clergy as a\r\nbody was an ideal from the beginning of the fourth century, and became an\r\nestablished principle by the middle of the fifth century under Leo the\r\nGreat, though as a matter of fact it was not enforced as a universal\r\nobligation of the clerical order until the reforms of Gregory VII. In the\r\nfollowing canons and documents the division is made between the East and\r\nthe West, and the selected documents are arranged chronologically so as to\r\nshow the progress in legislation toward the condition that afterward\r\nbecame dominant in the respective divisions of the Empire and the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) _Clerical Marriage in the East_\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Council of Ancyra, A. D. 314, _Canon_ 10. Bruns, I, 68. _Cf._ Mirbt,\r\nn. 90.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following canon is important as being the first Eastern\r\n    regulation of a council bearing on the subject and having been\r\n    generally followed long before the canons of this council were\r\n    adopted as binding by the Council of Constantinople known as the\r\n    Quinisext in 692, Canon 2; _cf._ Hefele, § 327. For the Council of\r\n    Ancyra, see Hefele, § 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 10. Those who have been made deacons, declaring when they were\r\nordained that they must marry, because they were not able to abide as they\r\nwere, and who afterward married, shall continue in the ministry because it\r\nwas conceded to them by the bishop. But if they were silent on the matter,\r\nundertaking at their ordination to abide as they were, and afterward\r\nproceeded to marry, they shall cease from the diaconate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Council of Nicæa, A. D. 325, _Canon_ 3. Bruns, I, 15. _Cf._ Mirbt,\r\nn. 101, Kirch, n. 363.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The meaning of the following canon is open to question because of\r\n    the term _subintroducta_ and the concluding clause. Hefele\r\n    contends that every woman is excluded except certain specified\r\n    persons. But the custom of the East was not to treat the rule as\r\n    meaning such. See E. Venables, art. “Subintroductæ,” in DCB; and\r\n    Achelis, art. “Subintroductæ,” in PRE. Hefele’s discussion may be\r\n    found in his _History of the Councils_, §§ 42 and 43; in the\r\n    latter he discusses the question as to the position of the council\r\n    as to the matter of clerical celibacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 3. The great synod has stringently forbidden any bishop, presbyter,\r\ndeacon, or any one of the clergy whatever, to have a _subintroducta_\r\n(συνείσακτος) dwelling with him, except only a mother, sister, or aunt, or\r\nsuch persons only as are beyond all suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Council of Gangra, A. D. 355-381, _Canon_ 4. Bruns, I, 107.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The canons of this council were approved at the Quinisext together\r\n    with those of Ancyra and Laodicæa and others. This canon is\r\n    directed against the fanaticism of the Eustathians.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 4. If any one shall maintain, concerning a married presbyter, that\r\nit is not lawful to partake of the oblation that he offers, let him be\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, V, 22. (MSG, 67:640.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    That the custom of clerical celibacy grew up without much regard\r\n    to conciliar action, and that canons only later regulated what had\r\n    been established and modified by custom, is illustrated by the\r\n    variation in the matter of clerical marriage noted by Socrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nI myself learned of another custom in Thessaly. If a clergyman in that\r\ncountry should, after taking orders, cohabit with his wife, whom he had\r\nlegally married before ordination, he would be degraded.(157) In the East,\r\nindeed, all clergymen and even bishops abstain from their wives; but this\r\nthey do of their own accord and not by the necessity of law; for many of\r\nthem have had children by their lawful wives during their episcopate. The\r\nauthor of the usage which obtains in Thessaly was Heliodorus, bishop of\r\nTricca in that country, under whose name it is said that erotic books are\r\nextant, entitled _Ethiopica_, which he composed in his youth. The same\r\ncustom prevails in Thessalonica and in Macedonia and Achaia.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Quinisext Council, A. D. 692, _Canons_ 6, 12, 13, 48. Bruns, I, 39\r\n_ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Canons on celibacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Trullan Council fixed the practice of the Eastern churches\r\n    regarding the celibacy of the clergy. In general it may be said\r\n    that the clergyman was not allowed to marry after ordination. But\r\n    if he married before ordination he did not, except in the case of\r\n    the bishops separate from his wife, but lived with her in lawful\r\n    marital relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 6. Since it is declared in the Apostolic Canons that of those who\r\nare advanced to the clergy unmarried, only lectors and cantors are able to\r\nmarry, we also, maintaining this, determine that henceforth it is in\r\nnowise lawful for any subdeacon, deacon, or presbyter after his ordination\r\nto contract matrimony; but if he shall have dared to do so, let him be\r\ndeposed. And if any of those who enter the clergy wishes to be joined to a\r\nwife in lawful marriage before he is ordained subdeacon, deacon, or\r\npresbyter, let it be done.\r\n\r\nCanon 12. Moreover, it has also come to our knowledge that in Africa and\r\nLibya and in other places the most God-beloved bishops in those parts do\r\nnot refuse to live with their wives, even after consecration, thereby\r\ngiving scandal and offence to the people. Since, therefore, it is our\r\nparticular care that all things tend to the good of the flock placed in\r\nour hands and committed to us, it has seemed good that henceforth nothing\r\nof the kind shall in any way occur.… But if any shall have been observed\r\nto do such a thing, let him be deposed.\r\n\r\nCanon 13. [Text in Kirch, nn. 985 _ff._] Since we know it to be handed\r\ndown as a rule of the Roman Church that those who are deemed worthy to be\r\nadvanced to the diaconate and presbyterate should promise no longer to\r\ncohabit with their wives, we, preserving the ancient rule and apostolic\r\nperfection and order, will that lawful marriage of men who are in holy\r\norders be from this time forward firm, by no means dissolving their union\r\nwith their wives nor depriving them of their mutual intercourse at a\r\nconvenient season.… For it is meet that they who assist at the divine\r\naltar should be absolutely continent when they are handling holy things,\r\nin order that they may be able to obtain from God what they ask in\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\nCanon 48. The wife of him who is advanced to the episcopal dignity shall\r\nbe separated from her husband by mutual consent, and after his ordination\r\nand consecration to the episcopate she shall enter a monastery situated at\r\na distance from the abode of the bishop, and there let her enjoy the\r\nbishop’s provision. And if she is deemed worthy she may be advanced to the\r\ndignity of a deaconess.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B) _Clerical Celibacy in the West_\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Council of Elvira, A. D. 306, _Canon_ 33. Bruns, II, 6. _Cf._ Mirbt,\r\nn. 90, and Kirch, n. 305.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is the earliest canon of any council requiring clerical\r\n    celibacy. For the Council of Elvira, see Hefele, § 13; A. W. W.\r\n    Dale, _The Synod of Elvira_, London. 1882. For discussion of\r\n    reasons for assigning a later date, see E. Hennecke, art. “Elvira,\r\n    Synode um 313,” in PRE, and the literature there cited. The\r\n    council was a provincial synod of southern Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 33. It was voted that it be entirely forbidden(158) bishops,\r\npresbyters, and deacons, and all clergy placed in the ministry to abstain\r\nfrom their wives and not to beget sons: whoever does this, let him be\r\ndeprived of the honor of the clergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Siricius, _Decretal_ A. D. 385. (MSL, 13:1138.) Mirbt, nn. 122 _f._;\r\n_cf._ Denziger, nn. 87 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clerical celibacy: the force of decretals.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the following passages from the first authentic decretal, the\r\n    celibacy of the clergy is laid down as of divine authority in the\r\n    Church, and the rule remains characteristic of the Western Church.\r\n    See Canon 13 of the Quinisext Council, above, § 78, _c_. The\r\n    binding authority of the decretals of the bishop of Rome is also\r\n    asserted, and this, too, becomes characteristic of the\r\n    jurisprudence of the Western Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 7 (§ 8). Why did He admonish them to whom the holy of holies was\r\ncommitted, Be ye holy, because I the Lord your God am holy? [Lev. 20:7.]\r\nWhy were they commanded to dwell in the temple in the year of their turn\r\nto officiate, afar from their own homes? Evidently it was for the reason\r\nthat they might not be able to maintain their marital relations with their\r\nwives, so that, adorned with a pure conscience, they might offer to God an\r\nacceptable sacrifice. After the time of their service was accomplished\r\nthey were permitted to resume their marital relations for the sake of\r\ncontinuing the succession, because only from the tribe of Levi was it\r\nordained that any one should be admitted to the priesthood.… Wherefore\r\nalso our Lord Jesus, when by His coming He brought us light, solemnly\r\naffirmed in the Gospel that He came not to destroy but to fulfil the law.\r\nAnd therefore He who is the bridegroom of the Church wished that its form\r\nshould be resplendent with chastity, so that in the day of Judgment, when\r\nHe should come again, He might find it without spot or blemish, as He\r\ntaught by His Apostle. And by the rule of its ordinances which may not be\r\ngainsaid, we who are priests and Levites are bound from the day of our\r\nordination to keep our bodies in soberness and modesty, so that in those\r\nsacrifices which we offer daily to our God we may please Him in all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nCh. 15 (§ 20). To each of the cases, which by our son Bassanius you have\r\nreferred to the Roman Church as the head of your body, we have returned,\r\nas I think, a sufficient answer. Now we exhort your brotherly mind more\r\nand more to obey the canons and to observe the decretals that have been\r\ndrawn up, that those things which we have written to your inquiries you\r\nmay cause to be brought to the attention of all our fellow-bishops, and\r\nnot only of those who are placed in your diocese, but also of the\r\nCarthaginians, the Bætici, the Lusitani, and the Gauls, and those who in\r\nneighboring provinces border upon you, those things which by us have been\r\nhelpfully decreed may be sent accompanied by your letters. And although no\r\npriest of the Lord is free to ignore the statutes of the Apostolic See and\r\nthe venerable definitions of the canons, yet it would be more useful and,\r\non account of the long time you have been in holy orders, exceedingly\r\nglorious for you, beloved, if those things which have been written you\r\nespecially by name, might through your agreement with us be brought to the\r\nnotice of all our brethren, and that, seeing that they have not been drawn\r\nup inconsiderately but prudently and with very great care, they should\r\nremain inviolate, and that, for the future, opportunity for any excuse\r\nmight be cut off, which is now open to no one among us.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Council of Carthage, A. D. 390, _Canon 2_. Bruns, I, 117.\r\n\r\n\r\n    See also Canon 1 of the same council.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 2. Bishop Aurelius said: “When in a previous council the matter of\r\nthe maintenance of continence and chastity was discussed, these three\r\norders were joined by a certain agreement of chastity through their\r\nordination, bishops, I say, presbyters, and deacons; as it was agreed that\r\nit was seemly that they, as most holy pontiffs and priests of God, and as\r\nLevites who serve divine things, should be continent in all things whereby\r\nthey may be able to obtain from God what they ask sincerely, so that what\r\nthe Apostles taught and antiquity observed, we also keep.” By all the\r\nbishops it was said: “It is the pleasure of all that bishops, presbyters,\r\nand deacons, or those who handle the sacraments, should be guardians of\r\nmodesty, and refrain themselves from their wives.” By all it was said: “It\r\nis our pleasure that in all things, and by all, modesty should be\r\npreserved, who serve the altar.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Leo the Great, _Ep. 14_, _ad Anastasium_; _Ep. 167_, _ad Rusticum_.\r\n(MSL, 54:672, 1204.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The final form of the Western rule, that the clergy, from\r\n    subdeacon to bishop, both inclusive, should be bound to celibacy,\r\n    was expressed in its permanent form by Leo the Great in his\r\n    letters to Anastasius and Rusticus. From each of these letters the\r\n    passage bearing on the subject is quoted. By thus following up the\r\n    ideas of the Council of Elvira and the Council of Carthage as well\r\n    as the decretal of Siricius, the subdeacon was included among\r\n    those who were vowed to celibacy, for he, too, served at the\r\n    altar, and came to be counted as one of the major orders of the\r\n    ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\nEp. 14, Ch. 5. Although they who are not within the ranks of the clergy\r\nare free to take pleasure in the companionship of wedlock and the\r\nprocreation of children, yet, for the sake of exhibiting the purity of\r\ncomplete continence, even subdeacons are not allowed carnal marriage; that\r\n“both they that have wives be as though they had none” [I Cor. 7:29], and\r\nthey that have not may remain single. But if in this order, which is the\r\nfourth from the head, this is worthy to be observed, how much more is it\r\nto be kept in the first, the second, and the third, lest any one be\r\nreckoned fit for either the deacon’s duties or the presbyter’s honorable\r\nposition, or the bishop’s pre-eminence, who is discovered as not yet\r\nhaving bridled his uxorious desires.\r\n\r\nEp. 167, Quest. 3. Concerning those who minister at the altar and have\r\nwives, whether they may cohabit with them.\r\n\r\nReply. The same law of continence is for the ministers of the altar as for\r\nthe bishops and priests who, when they were laymen, could lawfully marry\r\nand procreate children. But when they attained to the said ranks, what was\r\nbefore lawful became unlawful for them. And therefore in order that their\r\nwedlock may become spiritual instead of carnal, it is necessary that they\r\ndo not put away their wives(159) but to have them “as though they had them\r\nnot,” whereby both the affection of their married life may be retained and\r\nthe marriage functions cease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriod II. The Church From The Permanent Division Of The Empire Until The\r\nCollapse Of The Western Empire And The First Schism Between The East And\r\nThe West, Or Until About A. D. 500\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second period of the history of the Church under the Christian\r\nEmpire, the Church, although existing in two divisions of the Empire and\r\nexperiencing very different political fortunes, may still be regarded as\r\nforming a whole. The theological controversies distracting the Church,\r\nalthough different in the two halves of the Græco-Roman world, were felt\r\nto some extent in both divisions of the Empire and not merely in the one\r\nin which they were principally fought out; and in the condemnation of\r\nheresy, each half of the Church assisted the other. Though already marked\r\nlines of cleavage are clearly perceptible, and in the West the dominating\r\npersonality of Augustine forwarded the development of the characteristic\r\ntheology of the West, setting aside the Greek influences exerted through\r\nHilary, Ambrose, Rufinus, and Jerome, and adding much that was never\r\nappreciated in the East—yet the opponent of Augustine was condemned at the\r\ngeneral council of Ephesus, 431, held by Eastern bishops in the East; and\r\nat the same time in the East the controversies regarding the union of the\r\ndivine and human natures in Christ, although of interest almost entirely\r\nin the East and fought out by men of the East, found their preliminary\r\nsolution at Chalcedon in 451 upon a basis proposed by the West. On the\r\nother hand, the attitudes of the two halves of the Church toward many\r\nprofound problems were radically different, and the emergence of the Roman\r\nSee as the great centre of the West amid the overturn of the Roman world\r\nby the barbarians, and the steadily increasing ascendency of the State\r\nover the Church in the East tended inevitably to separate ecclesiastically\r\nas well as politically the two divisions of the Empire. As the emperors of\r\nthe East attempted to use dogmatic parties in the support of a political\r\npolicy, the differences between the Church of the East, under the Roman\r\nEmperor, and the Church of the West, where the imperial authority had\r\nceased to be a reality, became manifest in a schism resulting from the\r\nMonophysite controversy and the attempt to reconcile the Monophysites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. The Church At The Beginning Of The Permanent Separation Of The\r\nTwo Parts Of The Roman Empire\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Theodosius the Great had been the dominating power in the\r\ngovernment of the Empire almost from his accession in 379, he was sole\r\nruler of the united Roman Empire for only a few months before his death in\r\n395. The East and the West became henceforth permanently divided after\r\nhaving been united, since the reorganization of the Empire under\r\nDiocletian in 285, for only three periods aggregating twenty-eight years\r\nin all. The imperial authority was divided between the sons of Theodosius,\r\nArcadius taking the sovereignty of the East and Honorius that of the West.\r\nStilicho, a Vandal, directed the fortunes of the West until his death in\r\n408, but the Empire of the East soon began to take a leading part,\r\nespecially after the barbarians commenced to invade the West about 405,\r\nand to establish independent kingdoms within the boundaries of the Empire.\r\nThe German tribes that settled within the Empire were either Arians when\r\nthey entered or became such almost immediately after; this Arianism had\r\nbeen introduced among the West Goths from Constantinople during the\r\ndominance of that creed. The Franks alone of all the Germanic tribes were\r\nheathen when they settled within the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 79. The Empire of the Dynasty of Theodosius.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Emperors of the West_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Honorius; born 384, Emperor 395-423.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Valentinian III; born 419, Emperor 425-455; son of Galla Placidia,\r\n    the daughter of Theodosius the Great, and the Empress of the West\r\n    419-450.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Emperors of the East_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Arcadius: born 377, Emperor 395-408.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Theodosius II: born 401, Emperor 408-450.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Marcianus: Emperor 450-457; husband of Pulcheria (born 399, died\r\n    453), daughter of Arcadius.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest event in the first half of the fifth century, the period in\r\nwhich the degenerate descendants of Theodosius still retained the imperial\r\ntitle, was the Barbarian Invasion, a truly epoch-making event. In 405 the\r\nVandals, Alans, and Suevi crossed the Rhine, followed later by the\r\nBurgundians. August 24, 410, Alarich, the king of the West Goths, captured\r\nRome. In 419 the West Gothic kingdom was established with Toulouse as a\r\ncapital. In 429 the Vandals began to establish themselves in North Africa,\r\nand about 450 the Saxons began to invade Britain, abandoned by the Romans\r\nabout 409. Although the West was thus falling to pieces, the theory of the\r\nunity of the Empire was maintained and is expressed in the provision of\r\nthe new Theodosian Code of 439 for the uniformity of law throughout the\r\ntwo parts of the Empire. This theory of unity was not lost for centuries\r\nand was influential even into the eighth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Jerome, _Ep._ 123, _ad Ageruchiam_. (MSL, 22:1057.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Barbarian Invasions in the opening years of the fifth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Jerome’s letters are not to be considered a primary source for the\r\n    barbarian invasion, but they are an admirable source for the way\r\n    the invasion appeared to a man of culture and some patriotic\r\n    feeling. With this passage should be compared his _Ep._ 60, _ad\r\n    Heliodorum_, § 16, written in 396, in which he expresses his\r\n    belief that Rome was falling and describes the barbarian invaders.\r\n    The following letter was written 409.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 16. Innumerable savage tribes have overrun all parts of Gaul. The whole\r\ncountry between the Alps and the Pyrenees, between the Rhine and the\r\nocean, have been laid waste by Quadi, Vandals, Sarmatians, Alans, Gepidi,\r\nHerules,(160) Saxons, Bergundians, Allemans and, alas for the common\r\nweal—even the hordes of the Pannonians. For Asshur is joined with them\r\n(Psalm 83:8). The once noble city of Mainz has been captured and\r\ndestroyed. In its church many thousands have been massacred. The people of\r\nWorms have been extirpated after a long siege. The powerful city of\r\nRheims, the Ambiani [a tribe near Amiens], the Altrabtæ [a tribe near\r\nArras], the Belgians on the outskirts of the world, Tournay, Speyer, and\r\nStrassburg have fallen to Germany. The provinces of Aquitaine and of the\r\nNine Nations, of Lyons and Narbonne, with the exception of a few cities,\r\nall have been laid waste. Those whom the sword spares without, famine\r\nravages within. I cannot speak of Toulouse without tears; it has been kept\r\nhitherto from falling by the merits of its revered bishop, Exuperius. Even\r\nthe Spains are about to perish and tremble daily as they recall the\r\ninvasion of the Cymri; and what others have suffered once they suffer\r\ncontinually in fear.\r\n\r\n§ 17. I am silent about other places, that I may not seem to despair of\r\nGod’s mercy. From the Pontic Sea to the Julian Alps, what was once ours is\r\nours no longer. When for thirty years the barrier of the Danube had been\r\nbroken there was war in the central provinces of the Roman Empire. Long\r\nuse dried our tears. For all, except a few old people, had been born\r\neither in captivity or during a blockade, and they did not long for a\r\nliberty which they had never known. Who will believe it? What histories\r\nwill seriously discuss it, that Rome has to fight within her borders, not\r\nfor glory but for bare life; and that she does not fight even, but buys\r\nthe right to exist by giving gold and sacrificing all her substance? This\r\nhumiliation has been brought upon her, not by the fault of her emperors,\r\nboth of them most religious men [Arcadius and Honorius], but by the crime\r\nof a half-barbarian traitor,(161)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Jerome, _Prefaces to Commentary on Ezekiel_. (MSL, 25, 15:75.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The fall of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Jerome’s account of the capture of Rome by Alarich is greatly\r\n    exaggerated (see his _Ep._ 127, _ad Principiam_). By his very\r\n    exaggeration, however, one gains some impression of the shock the\r\n    event must have occasioned in the Roman world.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface to Book I. Intelligence has suddenly been brought to me of the\r\ndeath of Pammachus and Marcella, the siege of Rome [A. D. 408], and the\r\nfalling asleep of many of my brethren and sisters. I was so stupefied and\r\ndismayed that day and night I could think of nothing but the welfare of\r\nall.… But when the bright light of all the world was put out,(162) or,\r\nrather, when the Roman Empire was decapitated, and, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, the whole world perished in one city, “I became dumb and\r\nhumbled myself, and kept silence from good words, but my grief broke out\r\nafresh, my heart was hot within me, and while I was musing the fire was\r\nkindled” [Psalm 39:3, 4].\r\n\r\nPreface to Book III. Who would believe that Rome, built up by the conquest\r\nof the whole world, had collapsed; that she had become both the mother of\r\nnations and their tomb; that all the shores of the East, of Egypt, of\r\nAfrica, which had once belonged to the imperial city should be filled with\r\nthe hosts of her men-servants and maid-servants; that every day holy\r\nBethlehem should be receiving as mendicants men and women who were once\r\nnoble and abounding in every kind of wealth?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Theodosius II, _Novella I, de Theodosiani Codicis Auctoritate_; Feb.\r\n15, 439.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian, Augusti, to Florentius, Prætorian\r\nPrefect of the East.\r\n\r\nOur clemency has often been at a loss to understand the cause of the fact\r\nthat, although so many rewards are held out for the maintenance of arts\r\nand studies, so few and rare are they who are fully endowed with a\r\nknowledge of the civil law, and that although so many have grown pale from\r\nlate studies, scarcely one or two have gained a sound and complete\r\nlearning. When we consider the enormous multitude of books, the diversity\r\nin the forms of process, and the difficulty of legal cases, and, further,\r\nthe huge mass of imperial constitutions which, hidden as it were under a\r\nveil of gross mist and darkness, precludes man’s intellect from gaining a\r\nknowledge of them, we have performed a task needful for our age, and, the\r\ndarkness having been dispelled, we have given light to the laws by a brief\r\ncompendium. Noble men of approved faithfulness were selected, men of\r\nwell-known learning, to whom the matter was intrusted. We have published\r\nthe constitutions of former princes, cleared by interpretation of\r\ndifficulties so that men may no longer have to wait formidable responses\r\nfrom expert lawyers as from a shrine, since it is quite plain what is the\r\nvalue of a donation, by what action an inheritance is to be sued for, with\r\nwhat words a contract is to be made.… Thus having wiped out the cloud of\r\nvolumes, on which many wasted their lives and explained nothing in the\r\nend, we establish a compendious knowledge of the imperial constitutions\r\nsince the time of the divine Constantine, and permit no one after the\r\nfirst day of next January to use in courts and daily practice of law the\r\nimperial law, or to draw up pleadings except from these books which bear\r\nour name and are kept in the sacred archives.…\r\n\r\nTo this we add that henceforward no constitution can be passed in the West\r\nor in any other place by the unconquerable Emperor, the son of our\r\nclemency, the everlasting Augustus Valentinian, or possess any legal\r\nvalidity, except the same by a divine pragmatica be communicated to us.\r\nThe same rule is to be observed in the acts which are promulgated by us in\r\nthe East; and those are to be condemned as spurious which are not recorded\r\nin the Theodosian Code [certain documents excepted which were kept in the\r\nregisters of bureaux].\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 80. The Extension of the Church about the Beginning of the Fifth Century\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important missionary work in the early part of the fifth century\r\nwas the extension of the work of Ulfilas among the German tribes and the\r\nwork of the missionaries of the West in Gaul and western Germany. Of the\r\nlatter the most important was Martin of Tours.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, II, 41. (MSG, 67:349.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ulfilas.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional material for the life of Ulfilas may be found in the\r\n    _Ecclesiastical History_ of Philostorgius, fragments of which, as\r\n    preserved, may be found appended to the Bohn translation of\r\n    Sozomen’s _Ecclesiastical History_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    After giving a list of creeds put forth by various councils, from\r\n    Nicæa down to the Arian creed of Constantinople, 360 (text may be\r\n    found in Hahn, § 167), Socrates continues:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last creed was that put forth at Constantinople [A. D. 360], with the\r\nappendix. For to this was added the prohibition respecting the mention of\r\nsubstance [ousia], or subsistence [hypostasis], in relation to God. To\r\nthis creed Ulfilas, bishop of the Goths, then first gave his assent. For\r\nbefore that time he had adhered to the faith of Nicæa; for he was a\r\ndisciple of Theophilus, bishop of the Goths, who was present at the Nicene\r\nCouncil, and subscribed what was there determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Ulfilas, _Confession of Faith_. Hahn, § 198.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This confession of faith, which Ulfilas describes as his\r\n    testament, is found at the conclusion of a letter of Auxentius,\r\n    his pupil, an Arian bishop of Silistria, in Mœsia Inferior; see\r\n    note of Hahn. It should be compared with that of Constantinople of\r\n    360.\r\n\r\n\r\nI, Ulfilas, bishop and confessor, have always thus believed, and in this\r\nsole and true faith I make my testament before my Lord: I believe that\r\nthere is one God the Father, alone unbegotten and invisible; and in His\r\nonly begotten Son, our Lord and God, the fashioner and maker of all\r\ncreation, not having any one like him—therefore there is one God of all,\r\nwho, in our opinion, is God—and there is one Holy Spirit, the illuminating\r\nand sanctifying power—as Christ said to his apostles for correction,\r\n“Behold I send the promise of my Father to you, but remain ye in the city\r\nof Jerusalem until ye be indued with power from on high”; and again, “And\r\nye shall receive power coming upon you from the Holy Spirit”—neither God\r\nnor Lord, but a minister of Christ in all things; not ruler, but a\r\nsubject, and obedient in all things to the Son, and the Son himself\r\nsubject and obedient in all things to his Father … through Christ … with\r\nthe Holy Spirit.…(163)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, IV, 23. (MSG, 67:551.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe barbarians dwelling beyond the Danube, who are called Goths, having\r\nbeen engaged in a civil war among themselves, were divided into two\r\nparties; of one of these Fritigernus was the leader, of the other\r\nAthanaric. When Athanaric had obtained an evident advantage over his\r\nrival, Fritigernus had recourse to the Romans and implored their\r\nassistance against his adversary. When these things were reported to the\r\nEmperor Valens [364-378], he ordered the troops garrisoned in Thrace to\r\nassist those barbarians against the barbarians fighting against them. They\r\nwon a complete victory over Athanaric beyond the Danube, totally routing\r\nthe enemy. This was the reason why many of the barbarians became\r\nChristians: for Fritigernus, to show his gratitude to the Emperor for the\r\nkindness shown him, embraced the religion of the Emperor, and urged those\r\nunder him to do the same. Therefore it is that even to this present time\r\nso many of the Goths are infected with the religion of Arianism, because\r\nthe emperors at that time gave themselves to that faith. Ulfilas, the\r\nbishop of the Goths at that time, invented the Gothic letters and,\r\ntranslating the Holy Scriptures into their own language, undertook to\r\ninstruct these barbarians in the divine oracles. But when Ulfilas taught\r\nthe Christian religion not only to the subjects of Fritigernus but to the\r\nsubjects of Athanaric also, Athanaric, regarding this as a violation of\r\nthe privileges of the religion of his ancestors, subjected many of the\r\nChristians to severe punishments, so that many of the Arian Goths of that\r\ntime became martyrs. Arius, indeed, failing to refute the opinion of\r\nSabellius the Libyan, fell from the true faith and asserted that the Son\r\nof God was a new God; but the barbarians, embracing Christianity with\r\ngreater simplicity, despised this present life for the faith of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Sulpicius Severus, _Vita S. Martini_, 13. (MSL, 20:167.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sulpicius Severus was a pupil of Martin of Tours, and wrote the\r\n    life of his master during the latter’s lifetime (died 397), but\r\n    published it after his death. He wrote also other works on Martin.\r\n    The astounding miracles they contain present curious problems for\r\n    the student of ethics as well as of history. As St. Martin was one\r\n    of the most popular saints of Gaul, and in this case the merits of\r\n    the man and his reputation as a saint were in accord, the works of\r\n    Sulpicius became the basis of many popular lives of the saint. The\r\n    following passage illustrates the embellishment which soon became\r\n    attached to all the lives of religious heroes. It is, however, one\r\n    of the least astounding of the many miracles the author relates in\r\n    apparent good faith. Whatever may be the judgment regarding the\r\n    miracle, the story contains several characteristic touches met\r\n    with in the history of missions in the following centuries:\r\n    _e.g._, the destruction of heathen temples and objects of worship.\r\n    This sacred tree also finds its duplicate in other attacks upon\r\n    heathen sanctuaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 13. When in a certain village he had demolished a very ancient temple,\r\nand had set about cutting down a pine-tree, which stood close to the\r\ntemple, the chief priest of that place and a crowd of other heathen began\r\nto oppose him. And though these people, under the influence of the Lord,\r\nhad been quiet while the temple was being overthrown, they could not\r\npatiently allow the tree to be cut down. Martin carefully instructed them\r\nthat there was nothing sacred in the trunk of a tree; let them rather\r\nfollow God, whom he himself served. He added that it was necessary that\r\nthat tree be cut down, because it had been dedicated to a demon [_i.e._,\r\nto a heathen deity]. Then one of them, who was bolder than the others,\r\nsaid: “If you have any trust in the God whom you say you worship, we\r\nourselves will cut down this tree, you shall receive it when it falls; for\r\nif, as you declare, your Lord is with you, you will escape all injury.”\r\nThen Martin, courageously trusting in the Lord, promised that he would do\r\nthis. Thereupon all that crowd of heathen agreed to the condition; for\r\nthey held the loss of their tree a small matter, if only they got the\r\nenemy of their religion buried beneath its fall. Accordingly when that\r\npine-tree was hanging over in one direction, so that there was no doubt as\r\nto what side it would fall on being cut, Martin, having been bound, was,\r\nin accordance with the decision of these pagans, placed in that spot\r\nwhere, as no one doubted, the tree was about to fall. They began,\r\ntherefore, to cut down their own tree with great joy and mirth. At some\r\ndistance there was a great multitude of wondering spectators. And now the\r\npine-tree began to totter and to threaten its own ruin by falling. The\r\nmonks at a distance grew pale and, terrified by the danger ever coming\r\nnearer, had lost all hope and confidence, expecting only the death of\r\nMartin. But he, trusting in the Lord, and waiting courageously, when now\r\nthe falling pine had uttered its expiring crash, while it was now falling,\r\nwhile it was just rushing upon him, with raised hand put in its way the\r\nsign of salvation [_i.e._, the sign of the cross]. Then, indeed, after the\r\nmanner of a spinning top (one might have thought it driven back) it fell\r\non the opposite side, so that it almost crushed the rustics, who had been\r\nstanding in a safe spot. Then truly a shout was raised to heaven; the\r\nheathen were amazed by the miracle; the monks wept for joy; and the name\r\nof Christ was extolled by all in common. The well-known result was that on\r\nthat day salvation came to that region. For there was hardly one of that\r\nimmense multitude of heathen who did not desire the imposition of hands,\r\nand, abandoning his impious errors, believe in the Lord Jesus. Certainly,\r\nbefore the times of Martin, very few, nay, almost none, in those regions\r\nhad received the name of Christ; but through his virtues and example it\r\nhas prevailed to such an extent that now there is no place there which is\r\nnot filled with either very crowded churches or monasteries. For wherever\r\nhe destroyed heathen temples, there he was accustomed to build,\r\nimmediately, either churches or monasteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. The Church Of The Western Empire In The Fifth Century\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period between the closing years of the fourth century, in which the\r\nstruggle was still going on between heathenism and Christianity (§ 81),\r\nand the end of the Roman Empire of the West is of fundamental importance\r\nin the study of the history of the Christian Church of the West. In this\r\nperiod were laid the foundations for its characteristic theology and its\r\necclesiastical organization. The former was the work of St. Augustine, the\r\nmost powerful religious personality of the Western Church. In this he\r\nbuilt partly upon the traditions of the West, but also, largely, upon his\r\nown religious experience (§ 82). These elements were developed and\r\nmodified by the two great controversies in which, by discussion, he\r\nformulated more completely than ever had been done before the idea of the\r\nChurch and its sacraments in opposition to the Donatists (§ 83), and the\r\ndoctrines of sin and grace in opposition to a moralistic Christianity,\r\nrepresented by Pelagius (§ 84). The leading ideas of Augustine, however,\r\ncould be appropriated only as they were modified and brought into\r\nconformity with the dominant ecclesiastical and sacramental system of the\r\nChurch, in the semi-Pelagian controversy, which found a tardy termination\r\nin the sixth century (§ 85). In the meanwhile the inroads of the\r\nbarbarians with all the horrors of the invasions, the confusion in the\r\npolitical, social, and ecclesiastical organization, threatened the\r\noverthrow of all established institutions. In the midst of this anarchy,\r\nthe Roman See, in the work of Innocent I, and still more clearly in the\r\nwork of Leo the Great, enunciated its ideals and became the centre, not\r\nmerely of ecclesiastical unity, in which it had often to contest its\r\nclaims with the divided Church organizations of the West, but still more\r\nas the ideal centre of unity for all those that held to the old order of\r\nthe Empire with its culture and social life (§ 86).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 81. The Western Church Toward the End of the Fourth Century\r\n\r\n\r\nHeathenism lingered as a force in society longer in the West than in the\r\nEast, not merely among the peasantry, but among the higher classes. This\r\nwas partly due to the conservatism of the aristocratic classes and the\r\nsuperior form in which the religious philosophy of Neo-Platonism had been\r\npresented to the West. This presentation was due, in no small part, to the\r\nwork of such philosophers as Victorinus, who translated the earlier works\r\nof the Neo-Platonists so that it escaped the tendencies, represented by\r\nJamblichus, toward theurgy and magic, and an alliance with polytheism and\r\npopular superstition. Victorinus himself became a Christian, passing by an\r\neasy transition from Neo-Platonism to Christianity; a course in which he\r\nwas followed by Augustine, and, no doubt, by others as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugustine, _Confessiones_, VIII, 2. (MSL, 32:79.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The conversion of Victorinus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Simplicianus then I went—the father of Ambrose,(164) in receiving Thy\r\ngrace,(165) and whom he truly loved as a father. To him I narrated the\r\nwindings of my error. But when I mentioned to him that I had read certain\r\nbooks of the Platonists, which Victorinus, formerly professor of rhetoric\r\nat Rome (who died a Christian, as I had heard), had translated into Latin,\r\nhe congratulated me that I had not fallen upon the writings of other\r\nphilosophers, which were full of fallacies and deceit, “after the\r\nrudiments of this world” [Col. 2:8], whereas they, in many respects, led\r\nto the belief in God and His word. Then to exhort me to the humility of\r\nChrist, hidden from the wise and revealed to babes, he spoke of Victorinus\r\nhimself, whom, while he was in Rome, he had known intimately; and of him\r\nhe related that about which I will not be silent. For it contained great\r\npraise of Thy grace, which ought to be confessed unto Thee, how that most\r\nlearned old man, highly skilled in all the liberal sciences, who had read,\r\ncriticised, and explained so many works of the philosophers; the teacher\r\nof so many noble senators, who, also, as a mark of his excellent discharge\r\nof his duties, had both merited and obtained a statue in the Roman Forum\r\n(something men of this world esteem a great honor), he, who had been, even\r\nto that age, a worshipper of idols and a participator in the sacrilegious\r\nrites to which almost all the nobility of Rome were addicted, and had\r\ninspired the people with the love of “monster gods of every sort, and the\r\nbarking Anubis, who hold their weapons against Neptune and Venus and\r\nMinerva” [Vergil, _Æneid_, VIII, 736 _ff._], and those whom Rome once\r\nconquered, she now worshipped, all of which Victorinus, now old, had\r\ndefended so many years with vain language,(166) he now blushed not to be a\r\nchild of Thy Christ, and an infant at Thy fountain, submitting his neck to\r\nthe yoke of humility, and subduing his forehead to the reproach of the\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nO Lord, Lord, who hast bowed the heavens and come down, touched the\r\nmountains and they smoked [Psalm 144:5], by what means didst Thou convey\r\nThyself into that bosom? He used to read, Simplicianus said, the Holy\r\nScriptures and most studiously sought after and searched out all the\r\nChristian writings, and he said to Simplicianus, not openly, but secretly\r\nand as a friend: “Knowest thou that I am now a Christian?” To which he\r\nreplied: “I will not believe it, nor will I rank you among the Christians\r\nunless I see you in the Church of Christ.” Whereupon he replied\r\nderisively: “Do walls then make Christians?” And this he often said, that\r\nalready he was a Christian; and Simplicianus used as often to make the\r\nsame answer, and as often the conceit of the walls was repeated. For he\r\nwas fearful of offending his friends, proud demon worshippers, from the\r\nheight of whose Babylonian pride, as from the cedars of Lebanon, which the\r\nLord had not yet broken [Psalm 29:5], he seriously thought a storm of\r\nenmity would descend upon him. But after that he had derived strength from\r\nreading and inquiry, and feared lest he should be denied by Christ before\r\nthe holy angels if he was now afraid to confess Him before men [Matt.\r\n10:33], and appeared to himself to be guilty of a great fault in being\r\nashamed of the sacraments of the humility of Thy word, and not being\r\nashamed of the sacrilegious rites of those proud demons, which as a proud\r\nimitator he had accepted, he became bold-faced against vanity and\r\nshamefaced toward the truth, and suddenly and unexpectedly said to\r\nSimplicianus, as he himself informed me: “Let us go to the Church; I wish\r\nto be made a Christian.” And he, unable to contain himself for joy, went\r\nwith him. When he had been admitted to the first sacrament of instruction\r\n[_i.e._, the Catechumenate], he, not long after, gave in his name that he\r\nmight be regenerated by baptism. Meanwhile Rome marvelled and the Church\r\nrejoiced; the proud saw and were enraged; they gnashed with their teeth\r\nand melted away [Psalm 92:9]. But the Lord God was the hope of Thy\r\nservant, and He regarded not vanities and lying madness [Psalm 40:4].\r\n\r\nFinally the hour arrived when he should make profession of his faith,\r\nwhich, at Rome, they, who are about to approach Thy grace, are accustomed\r\nto deliver from an elevated place, in view of the faithful people, in a\r\nset form of words learnt by heart. But the presbyters, he said, offered\r\nVictorinus the privilege of making his profession more privately, as was\r\nthe custom to do to those who were likely, on account of bashfulness, to\r\nbe afraid; but he chose, rather, to profess his salvation in the presence\r\nof the holy assembly. For it was not salvation that he had taught in\r\nrhetoric and yet he had publicly professed that. How much less, therefore,\r\nought he, when pronouncing Thy word, to dread Thy meek flock, who, in the\r\ndelivery of his own words, had not feared the mad multitudes! So then,\r\nwhen he ascended to make his profession, and all recognized him, they\r\nwhispered his name one to the other, with a tone of congratulation. And\r\nwho was there among them that did not know him? And there ran through the\r\nmouths of all the rejoicing multitude a low murmur: “Victorinus!\r\nVictorinus!” Sudden was the burst of exultation at the sight of him, and\r\nas sudden the hush of attention that they might hear him. He pronounced\r\nthe true faith with an excellent confidence, and all desired to take him\r\nto their hearts, and by their love and joy they did take him to them; such\r\nwere the hands with which they took him.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 82. Augustine’s Life and Place in the Western Church\r\n\r\n\r\nAurelius Augustinus, the greatest of the Latin fathers, was born 354, at\r\nTagaste, in Numidia. He was educated to be a teacher of rhetoric, and\r\npractised his profession at Carthage, Rome, and Milan. From 374 to 383, he\r\nwas a Manichæan catechumen, for although his mother, Monnica, was a\r\nChristian, his religious education had been very meagre, and he was\r\nrepelled by the literary character of the Scriptures as commonly\r\ninterpreted. In 387, after a long struggle, and passing through various\r\nschools of thought, he, with his son Adeodatus, were baptized at Milan by\r\nAmbrose. In 391 he became a presbyter, and in 394 bishop of Hippo Regius,\r\na small town in North Africa. He died 430, during the Vandal invasion. Of\r\nhis works, the _Confessions_ are the most widely known, as they have\r\nbecome a Christian classic of edification of the first rank. They give an\r\naccount of his early life and conversion, but are more useful as showing\r\nhis type of piety than as a biography. From them is learned the secret of\r\nhis influence upon the Western world. The literary activity of Augustine\r\nwas especially developed in connection with the prolonged controversies,\r\nin which he was engaged throughout his episcopate (see §§ 83, 84), but he\r\nwrote much in addition to controversial treatises. The group of\r\ncharacteristic doctrines known as “Augustinianism,” viz.: Original Sin,\r\nPredestination, and Grace and the doctrines connected with them, were, to\r\na large extent, the outcome of his own religious experience. He had known\r\nthe power and depth of sin. He had discovered the hand of God leading him\r\nin spite of himself. He knew that his conversion was due, not to his own\r\neffort or merit, but to God’s grace.\r\n\r\nThe works of Augustine have been translated in part in PNF, ser. I, vols.\r\nI-VIII. There are many translations of the _Confessions_; among others,\r\none by E. B. Pusey, in “Library of the Fathers of the Holy Catholic\r\nChurch,” reprinted in “Everyman’s Library.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Augustine, _Confessiones_, VIII, 12. (MSL, 32:761.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The conversion of Augustine.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is, perhaps, the most famous passage in the _Confessions_. It\r\n    came at the end of a long series of attempts to find peace in\r\n    various forms of philosophy and religion. Augustine regarded it as\r\n    miraculous, the crown and proof of the work of grace in him. The\r\n    scene was in Milan, 387, in the garden of the villa he occupied\r\n    with his friend Alypius. The principal obstacle to his embracing\r\n    Christianity was his reluctance to abandon his licentious life. To\r\n    this the reference is made in the passage from Scripture which he\r\n    read, _i.e._, Rom. 13:13, 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a profound reflection had, from the depths of my soul, drawn together\r\nand heaped up all my misery before the sight of my heart, there arose a\r\nmighty storm, accompanied by as mighty a shower of tears. That I might\r\npour it all forth in its own words I arose from beside Alypius; for\r\nsolitude suggested itself to me as fitter for the business of weeping. So\r\nI retired to such a distance that even his presence could not be\r\noppressive to me. Thus it was with me at that time, and he perceived it;\r\nfor something, I believe, I had spoken, wherein the sound of my voice\r\nappeared choked with weeping, and thus I had risen up. He then remained\r\nwhere we had been sitting, very greatly astonished. I flung myself down, I\r\nknow not how, under a certain fig-tree, giving free course to my tears,\r\nand the streams of my eyes gushed out, an acceptable sacrifice unto Thee.\r\nAnd not indeed in these words, yet to this effect, spake I much unto\r\nThee—“But Thou, O Lord, how long?” [Psalm 13:1]. “How long, Lord? Wilt\r\nThou be angry forever? Oh, remember not against us former iniquities”\r\n[Psalm 79:5, 8]; for I felt that I was held fast by them. I sent up these\r\nsorrowful cries: “How long, how long? To-morrow, and to-morrow? Why not\r\nnow? Why is there not this hour an end to my uncleanness?”\r\n\r\nI was saying these things and was weeping in the most bitter contrition of\r\nmy heart, when, lo, I hear the voice as of a boy or girl, I know not\r\nwhich, coming from a neighboring house, chanting and oft repeating: “Take\r\nup and read; take up and read.” Immediately my countenance was changed,\r\nand I began most earnestly to consider whether it was usual for children\r\nin any kind of game to sing such words; nor could I remember ever to have\r\nheard the like anywhere. So, restraining the torrent of my tears, I rose\r\nup, interpreting it in no other way than as a command to me from Heaven to\r\nopen the book and read the first chapter I should light upon. For I had\r\nheard of Anthony [see also § 77, _e_], that accidentally coming in whilst\r\nthe Gospel was being read, he received the admonition as if what was read\r\nwas addressed to him: “Go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,\r\nand thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me” [Matt.\r\n19:21]. And by such oracle was he forthwith converted unto Thee. So\r\nquickly I returned to the place where Alypius was sitting; for there had I\r\nput down the volume of the Apostles, when I rose thence. I seized, I\r\nopened, and in silence I read that paragraph on which my eye first fell:\r\n“Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in\r\nstrife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not\r\nprovision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof” [Rom. 13:13, 14]. No\r\nfurther would I read; there was no need; for instantly, as the sentence\r\nended, by a light, as it were, of security infused into my heart, all the\r\ngloom of doubt vanished away.\r\n\r\nClosing the book, then, and putting either my finger between, or some\r\nother mark, I now with a tranquil countenance made it known to Alypius.\r\nAnd he thus disclosed to me what was wrong in him, which I knew not. He\r\nasked to look at what I had read. I showed him; and he looked even further\r\nthan I had read, and I knew not what followed. This, in fact, followed:\r\n“Him that is weak in the faith, receive ye” [Rom. 14:1]; which he applied\r\nto himself, and discovered to me. By this admonition was he strengthened;\r\nand by a good resolution and purpose, very much in accord with his\r\ncharacter (wherein, for the better, he was always far different from me),\r\nwithout any restless delay he joined me. Thence we go to my mother. We\r\ntell her—she rejoices. We relate how it came to pass—she exults and\r\ntriumphs, and she blesses Thee, who art “able to do exceeding abundantly\r\nabove all that we ask or think” [Eph. 3:20]; for she perceived Thee to\r\nhave given her more for me than she used to ask by her pitiful and most\r\ndoleful groanings. For Thou didst so convert me unto Thyself, that I\r\nsought neither a wife, nor any other hope of this world—standing in that\r\nrule of faith in which Thou, so many years before, had showed me unto her.\r\nAnd thou didst turn her grief unto gladness [Psalm 30:11], much more\r\nplentiful than she had desired, and much dearer and chaster than she used\r\nto crave, by having grandchildren of my flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Augustine, _Confessiones_, X, 27, 29, 43. (MSL, 32:795, 796, 808.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following passages from the _Confessions_ are intended to\r\n    illustrate Augustine’s type of piety.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 29. My whole hope is only in Thy exceeding great mercy. Give what Thou\r\ncommandest and command what Thou wilt.(167) Thou imposest continency upon\r\nus. “And when I perceived,” saith one, “that no one could be continent\r\nexcept God gave it; and this was a point of wisdom also to know whose this\r\ngift was” [Wis. 8:21]. For by continency are we bound up and brought into\r\none, whence we were scattered abroad into many. For he loves Thee too\r\nlittle, who besides Thee loves aught which he loves not for Thee. O love,\r\nwho ever burnest and art never quenched! O charity, my God, kindle me!\r\nThou commandest continency; give what Thou commandest, and command what\r\nThou wilt.\r\n\r\nCh. 27. Too late have I loved Thee, O fairness, so ancient, yet so new!\r\nToo late have I loved Thee. For behold Thou wast within and I was without,\r\nand I was seeking Thee there; I, without love, rushed heedlessly among the\r\nthings of beauty Thou madest. Thou wast with me, but I was not with Thee.\r\nThose things kept me far from Thee, which, unless they were in Thee, were\r\nnot. Thou didst call and cry aloud, and Thou broke through my deafness.\r\nThou didst gleam and shine and chase away my blindness. Thou didst exhale\r\nfragrance and I drew in my breath and I panted for Thee. I tasted, and did\r\nhunger and thirst. Thou didst touch me, and I burned for Thy peace.\r\n\r\nCh. 43. O how Thou hast loved us, O good Father, who sparedst not thine\r\nonly Son, but didst deliver Him up for us wicked ones! [Rom. 8:32.] O how\r\nThou hast loved us, for whom He, who thought it not robbery to be equal\r\nwith Thee, “became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross”\r\n[Phil. 2:8]. He alone, “free among the dead” [Psalm 88:5], that had power\r\nto lay down His life, and power to take it again [John 10:18]; for us was\r\nHe unto Thee both victor and the victim, and the victor became the victim;\r\nfor He was unto Thee both priest and sacrifice, and priest because\r\nsacrifice; making us from being slaves to become Thy sons, by being born\r\nof Thee, and by serving us. Rightly, then, is my strong hope in Him,\r\nbecause Thou didst cure all my diseases by Him who sitteth at Thy right\r\nhand and maketh intercession for us [Rom. 8:34]; else should I utterly\r\ndespair. For numerous and great are my infirmities, yea numerous and great\r\nare they; but Thy medicine is greater. We might think that Thy word was\r\nremoved from union with man and despair of ourselves had not He been “made\r\nflesh and dwelt among us” [John 1:14].\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Augustine, _De Civitate Dei_, XIII, 3, 14. (MSL, 41:378; 86.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Fall of Man and Original Sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _City of God_ is Augustine’s great theodicy, apology, and\r\n    philosophy of universal history. It was begun shortly after the\r\n    capture of Rome, and the author was engaged upon it from 413 to\r\n    426. It was the source whence the mediæval ecclesiastics drew\r\n    their theoretical justification for the curialistic principles of\r\n    the relation of State and Church, and at the same time the one\r\n    work of St. Augustine that Gibbon the historian regarded highly.\r\n    For an analysis see Presensée, art. “Augustine” in DCB.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Compare the position of Augustine with the following passage from\r\n    St. Ambrose, _On the Death of Satyrus_, II, 6, “Death is alike to\r\n    all, without difference for the poor, without exception for the\r\n    rich. And so although through the sin of one alone, yet it passed\r\n    upon all; … In Adam I fell, in Adam I was cast out of paradise. In\r\n    Adam I died; how shall the Lord call me back, except He find me in\r\n    Adam; guilty as I was in him, so now justified in Christ.” [MSL,\r\n    16:1374.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first men would not have suffered death if they had not sinned.… But\r\nhaving become sinners they were so punished with death, that whatsoever\r\nsprang from their stock should also be punished with the same death. For\r\nnothing else could be born of them than what they themselves had been. The\r\ncondemnation changed their nature for the worse in proportion to the\r\ngreatness of their sin, so that what was before as punishment in the man\r\nwho had first sinned, followed as of nature in others who were born.… In\r\nthe first man, therefore, the whole human nature was to be transmitted by\r\nthe woman to posterity when that conjugal union received the divine\r\nsentence of its own condemnation; and what man was made, not when he was\r\ncreated but when he sinned, and was punished, this he propagated, so far\r\nas the origin of sin and death are concerned.\r\n\r\nCh. 14. For God, the author of natures, not of vices, created man upright;\r\nbut man, being by his own will corrupt and justly condemned, begot\r\ncorrupted and condemned children. For we were all in that one man when we\r\nwere all that one man, who fell into sin by the woman who had been made\r\nfrom him before the sin. For not yet was the particular form created and\r\ndistributed to us, in which we as individuals were to live; but already\r\nthe seminal nature was there from which we were to be propagated; and this\r\nbeing vitiated by sin, and bound by the chain of death, and justly\r\ncondemned, man could not be born of man in any other state. And thus from\r\nthe bad use of free will, there originated a whole series of evils, which\r\nwith its train of miseries conducts the human race from its depraved\r\norigin, as from a corrupt root, on to the destruction of the second death,\r\nwhich has no end, those only being excepted who are freed by the grace of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Augustine, _De Correptione et Gratia_, 2. (MSL, 44:917.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Grace and Free Will.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the Lord not only shows us what evil we should shun, and what good we\r\nshould do, which is all the letter of the law can do; but moreover He\r\nhelps us that we may shun evil and do good [Psalm 37:27], which none can\r\ndo without the spirit of grace; and if this be wanting, the law is present\r\nmerely to make us guilty and to slay us. It is on this account that the\r\nApostle says: “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life” [II Cor.\r\n3:6]. He, then, who lawfully uses the law, learns therein evil and good,\r\nand not trusting in his own strength, flees to grace, by the help of which\r\nhe may shun evil and do good. But who flees to grace except when “the\r\nsteps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and He wills his ways”? [Psalm\r\n37:23.] And thus also to desire the help of grace is the beginning of\r\ngrace.… It is to be confessed, therefore, that we have free choice to do\r\nboth evil and good; but in doing evil every one is free from righteousness\r\nand is a servant of sin, while in doing good no one can be free, unless he\r\nhave been made free by Him who said: “If the Son shall make you free, then\r\nyou shall be free indeed” [John 8:36]. Neither is it thus, that when any\r\none shall have been made free from the dominion of sin, he no longer needs\r\nthe help of his Deliverer; but rather thus, that hearing from Him,\r\n“Without me ye can do nothing” [John 15:5], he himself also says to Him:\r\n“Be Thou my helper! Forsake me not!”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Augustine, _De Civitate Dei_, XV, 1. (MSL, 41:437.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Predestination.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inasmuch as all men are born condemned, and of themselves have not\r\n    the power to turn to grace, which alone can save them, it follows\r\n    that the bestowal of grace whereby they may turn is not dependent\r\n    upon the man but upon God’s sovereign good pleasure. This is\r\n    expressed in the doctrine of Predestination. For a discussion of\r\n    the position of Augustine respecting Predestination and his other\r\n    doctrines as connected with it, see J. B. Mozley, _A Treatise on\r\n    the Augustinian Doctrine of Predestination_, 1873, a book of great\r\n    ability. _Cf._ also Tixeront, _History of Dogmas_, vol. II.\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust that we have already done justice to these great and difficult\r\nquestions regarding the beginning of the world, of the soul, and of the\r\nhuman race itself. This race we have distributed into two parts: the one\r\nconsisting of those who live according to man, the other of those who live\r\naccording to God. And these we have also mystically called the two cities,\r\nor the two communities of men, of which one is predestined to reign\r\neternally with God, and the other to suffer eternal punishment with the\r\ndevil.…\r\n\r\nEach man, because born of condemned stock, is first of all born from Adam,\r\nevil and carnal, and when he has been grafted into Christ by regeneration\r\nhe afterward becomes good and spiritual. So in the human race, as a whole,\r\nwhen these two cities began to run their course by a series of births and\r\ndeaths, the citizen of this world was born first, and after him the\r\nstranger of this world, and belonging to the City of God,(168) predestined\r\nby grace, elected by grace, by grace a stranger here below, and by grace a\r\ncitizen above. For so far as regards himself he is sprung from the same\r\nmass, all of which is condemned in its origin; but God like a potter (for\r\nthis comparison is introduced by the Apostle judiciously and not without\r\nthought) of the same lump made one vessel to honor and another to dishonor\r\n[Rom. 9:21].\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Augustine, _De Correptione et Gratia_, chs. 23 (9), 39 (13). (MSL,\r\n44:930, 940.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 23 (9). Whosoever, therefore, in God’s most providential ordering are\r\nforeknown [_præsciti_] and predestinated, called justified, glorified—I\r\nsay not, even though not yet born again, but even though not yet born at\r\nall—are already children of God, and absolutely cannot perish.… From Him,\r\ntherefore, is given also perseverance in good even to the end; for it is\r\nnot given except to those who will not perish, since they who do not\r\npersevere will perish.(169)\r\n\r\nCh. 39 (13). I speak of those who are predestinated to the kingdom of God,\r\nwhose number is so certain that no one can either be added to them or\r\ntaken from them; not of those who when He had announced and spoken, were\r\nmultiplied beyond number [Psalm 40:6]. For these may be said to be called\r\n[_vocati_] but not chosen [_electi_], because they are not called\r\naccording to purpose.(170)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Augustine, _Enchiridion_, 100. (MSL, 40:279.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Twofold Predestination.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Augustine does not commonly speak of predestination of the wicked,\r\n    _i.e._, those who are not among the elect and consequently\r\n    predestinated to grace and salvation. As a rule he speaks of\r\n    predestination in connection with the saints, those who are saved.\r\n    But that he, with perfect consistency, regarded the wicked as also\r\n    predestinated is shown by the following, as also other passages in\r\n    his works, _e.g._, _City of God_, XV, 1 (_v. supra_), XXII, ch.\r\n    24:5. This point has a bearing in connection with the controversy\r\n    on predestination in the ninth century, in which Gottschalk\r\n    reasserted the theory of a double predestination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the great works of the Lord, sought out according to all His\r\ngood pleasure [Psalm 111:2], and wisely sought out, that when the angelic\r\nand the human creature sinned, that is, did not do what He willed but what\r\nthe creature itself willed, so by the will of the creature, by which was\r\ndone what the Creator did not will, He carried out what He himself willed;\r\nthe supremely Good thus turning to account even what is evil; to the\r\ncondemnation of those whom He has justly predestinated to punishment and\r\nto the salvation of those whom He has mercifully predestinated to grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Augustine, _De Civitate Dei_, XVI, 2. (MSL, 41:479.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Augustine’s theory of allegorical interpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Augustine had been repelled by the literal interpretation of the\r\n    Scriptures and turned to the Manichæans who rejected the Old\r\n    Testament. _Confessions_, III, 5. From Ambrose he learned the\r\n    “mystical” or allegorical method of interpreting the Old\r\n    Testament, _cf._ _Confessions_, VI, 4. With Augustine’s theory,\r\n    treated at length, especially in his _De Doctrina Christiana_, Bk.\r\n    3, should be compared Origen’s in _De Principiis_, IV, 9-15. See\r\n    above, § 43, _b_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese secrets of the divine Scriptures we investigate as we can;(171) some\r\nin more, some in less agreement, but all faithfully holding it as certain\r\nthat these things were neither done nor recorded without some\r\nforeshadowing of future events, and that they are to be referred only to\r\nChrist and His Church, which is the City of God, the proclamation of which\r\nhas not ceased since the beginning of the human race; and we now see it\r\neverywhere accomplished. From the blessing of the two sons of Noah and\r\nfrom the cursing of the middle son, down to Abraham, for more than a\r\nthousand years, there is no mention of any righteous person who worshipped\r\nGod. I would not, therefore, believe that there were none, but to mention\r\nevery one would have been very long, and there would have been historical\r\naccuracy rather than prophetic foresight. The writer of these sacred\r\nbooks, or rather the Spirit of God through him, sought for those things by\r\nwhich not only the past might be narrated, but the future foretold, which\r\npertained to the City of God; for whatever is said of these men who are\r\nnot its citizens is given either that it may profit or be made glorious by\r\na comparison with what is different. Yet it is not to be supposed that all\r\nthat is recorded has some signification; but those things which have no\r\nsignification of their own are interwoven for the sake of the things which\r\nare significant. Only by the ploughshare is the earth cut in furrows; but\r\nthat this may be, other parts of the plough are necessary. Only the\r\nstrings of the harp and other musical instruments are fitted to give forth\r\na melody; but that they may do so, there are other parts of the instrument\r\nwhich are not, indeed, struck by those who sing, but with them are\r\nconnected the strings which are struck and produce musical notes. So in\r\nprophetic history some things are narrated which have no significance, but\r\nare, as it were, the framework to which the significant things are\r\nattached.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i_) Augustine, _Enchiridion_, 109, 110. (MSL, 40:283.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Augustine in his teaching combined a number of different\r\n    theological tendencies, without working them into a consistent\r\n    system. His doctrines of Original Sin, Predestination, Grace are\r\n    by no means harmonized with his position regarding the Church and\r\n    the sacraments in which he builds upon the foundation laid in the\r\n    West, especially by Optatus. See below, § 83. There is also a no\r\n    small remnant of what might be called pre-Augustinian Western\r\n    piety, which comes down from Tertullian and of which the following\r\n    is an illustration, a passage which is of significance in the\r\n    development of the doctrine of purgatory. Cf. Tertullian, _De\r\n    Monogamia_, ch. 10. See above, § 39.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 109. The time, moreover, which intervenes between a man’s death and the\r\nfinal resurrection, keeps the soul in a hidden retreat, as each is\r\ndeserving of rest or affliction, according to what its lot was when it\r\nlived in the flesh.\r\n\r\n§ 110. Nor can it be denied that the souls of the dead are benefited by\r\nthe piety of their living friends, when the sacrifice of the Mediator is\r\noffered, or alms given in the Church in their behalf. But these services\r\nare of advantage only to those who during their lives merited that\r\nservices of this kind could help them. For there is a manner of life which\r\nis neither so good as not to require these services after death, nor so\r\nbad that these services are of no avail after death. There is, on the\r\nother hand, a kind of life so good as not to require them; and again one\r\nso bad that when they depart this life they render no help. Therefore it\r\nis here that all the merit and demerit is acquired, by which one can\r\neither be relieved or oppressed after death. No one, then, need hope that\r\nafter he is dead he shall obtain the merit with God which he had neglected\r\nhere. And, accordingly, those services which the Church celebrates for the\r\ncommendation of the dead are not opposed to the Apostle’s words: “For we\r\nmust all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may\r\nreceive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,\r\nwhether it be good or bad” [Rom. 14:10; II Cor. 5:10]. For that merit that\r\nrenders services profitable to a man, each one has acquired while he lives\r\nin the body. For it is not to every one that these services are\r\nprofitable. And why are they not profitable to all, except it be because\r\nof the different kinds of lives that men lead in the body? When,\r\ntherefore, sacrifices either of the altar or of alms of any sort are\r\noffered on behalf of the dead who have been baptized, they are\r\nthanksgivings for the very good; they are propitiations [_propitiationes_]\r\nfor the not very bad; and for the case of the very bad, even though they\r\ndo not assist the dead, they are a species of consolation to the living.\r\nAnd to those to whom they are profitable, their benefit consists either in\r\nfull remission of sins, or at least in making the condemnation more\r\ntolerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 83. Augustine and the Donatist Schism\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the recall of the Donatists by the Emperor Julian, the sect rapidly\r\nincreased, though soon numerous divisions appeared in the body. The more\r\nliberal opinions of the Donatist grammarian Tychonius about 370 were\r\nadopted by many of the less fanatical. The connection of the party with\r\nthe Circumcellions alienated others. The contest for rigorism led by\r\nMaximianus about 394 occasioned a schism within the Donatist body.\r\n\r\nAugustine’s activity in the Donatist troubles began as soon as he was made\r\nbishop of Hippo, as his town was made up largely of Donatists, who\r\nprobably constituted more than a half of the population. The books written\r\nby him after 400 have alone survived.\r\n\r\nThe turning-point in the history of Donatism was the Collatio, or\r\nconference, held at Carthage in 411. Two hundred and seventy-nine\r\nDonatist, and two hundred and eighty-six Catholic, bishops were present.\r\nAugustine was one of those who represented the Catholic position. The\r\nvictory was adjudged by the imperial commissioners to the Catholic party.\r\nAfter this the laws against the sect were enforced relentlessly, and\r\nDonatism rapidly lost its importance. The Vandal invasion in 429 changed\r\nthe condition of things for a time. The last traces of Donatism disappear\r\nonly with the Moslem invasion in the seventh century.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Donatist controversy is that in it were defined the\r\ndoctrines of the Church and of the sacraments, definitions which, with\r\nsome modifications, controlled the theology of the Church for centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Optatus, _De Schismate Donatistarum_, II, 1-3. (MSL, 11:941.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The unity of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 1. The next thing to do … is to show that there is one Church which\r\nChrist called a dove and a bride. Therefore the Church is one, the\r\nsanctity of which is derived from the sacraments; and it is not valued\r\naccording to the pride of persons. Therefore this one dove Christ also\r\ncalls his beloved bride. This cannot be among heretics and schismatics.…\r\nYou have said, brother Parmenianus, that it is with you alone … among you\r\nin a small part of Africa, in the corner of a small region, but among us\r\nin another part of Africa will it not be? In Spain, in Gaul, in Italy,\r\nwhere you are not, will it not be?… And through so many innumerable\r\nislands and other provinces, which can scarcely be numbered, will it not\r\nbe? Wherein then will be the propriety of the Catholic name, since it is\r\ncalled Catholic, because it is reasonable(172) and everywhere diffused?\r\n\r\nCh. 2. I have proved that that is the Catholic Church, which spread\r\nthroughout the whole world, and now are its ornaments to be recalled; and\r\nit is to be seen where the first five gifts [_i.e._, notes of the Church]\r\nare, which you say are six. Among these the first is the cathedra, and\r\nunless a bishop, who is the angel [the second gift or note according to\r\nthe Donatists], sit in it, no other gift can be joined. It is to be seen\r\nwho first placed a see and where.… You cannot deny that in the city of\r\nRome the episcopal cathedra was first placed by Peter, and in it sat\r\nPeter, the head of all the Apostles, wherefore he is called Cephas, so\r\nthat in that one cathedra unity is preserved by all, that the other\r\nApostles might not claim each one for himself a cathedra; so that he is a\r\nschismatic and a sinner who against that one cathedra sets up another.\r\n\r\nCh. 3. Therefore Peter first sat in that single cathedra, which is the\r\nfirst gift of the Church, to him succeeded Linus … to Damasus, Siricius,\r\nwho is our contemporary, with whom the world together with us agree in one\r\nfellowship of communion by the interchange of letters. Recite the origin\r\nof your cathedra, you who would claim for yourself the Holy Church [_cf._\r\nTertullian, _De Præscriptione_, c. 32].\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Optatus, _De Schismate Donatistarum_, V, 4. (MSL, 11:1051.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The validity of sacraments is not dependent on the character of\r\n    those who minister them. With this should be compared Augustine,\r\n    _Contra litteras Petiliani Donatistæ_, II, 38-91, and the treatise\r\n    _De Baptismo contra Donatistas libri septem_, which is little more\r\n    than a working out in a thousand variations of this theme.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn celebrating this sacrament of baptism there are three things which you\r\ncan neither increase, diminish, nor omit. The first is the Trinity, the\r\nsecond the believer, and the third the minister.… The first two remain\r\never immutable and unmoved. The Trinity is always the same, the faith in\r\neach is one. But the person of him who ministers is clearly not equal to\r\nthe first two points, in that it alone is mutable.… For it is not one man\r\nwho always and everywhere baptizes. In this work there were formerly\r\nothers, and now others still, and again there will be others; those who\r\nminister may be changed, the sacraments cannot be changed. Since therefore\r\nyou see that they who baptize are ministers and are not lords, and the\r\nsacraments are holy in themselves, not on account of men, why is it that\r\nyou claim so much for yourselves? Why is it that you endeavor to exclude\r\nGod from His gifts? Permit God to be over the things which are His. For\r\nthat gift cannot be performed by a man because it is divine. If you think\r\nit can be so bestowed, you render void the words of the prophets and the\r\npromises of God, by which it is proved that God washes, not man.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Augustine, _De Baptismo contra Donatistas_, IV, 17 (§ 24). (MSL,\r\n43:169.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Baptism without the Church valid but unprofitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Augustine, as opposing the Donatists and agreeing with the\r\n    Catholic Church, asserted the validity of baptism when conferred\r\n    by one outside the communion of the Church. It was notorious that\r\n    Cyprian and the Council of Carthage, A. D. 258 [see ANF, vol. V.,\r\n    pp. 565 _ff._; _cf._ Hefele, § 6], had held an opposite opinion.\r\n    As Cyprian was the great teacher of North Africa, and in the\r\n    highest place in the esteem of all, Augustine was forced to make\r\n    “distinctions.” This he did in his theory as to the validity of\r\n    baptism as in the following passage. The Sixth Book of the same\r\n    treatise is composed of a statement of the bishops at the Council\r\n    of Carthage, and Augustine’s answer to each statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Can the power of baptism,” says Cyprian, “be greater than confession,\r\nthan martyrdom, that a man should confess Christ before men, and be\r\nbaptized in his own blood, and yet,” he says, “neither does this baptism\r\nprofit the heretic, even though for confessing Christ he be put to death\r\noutside the Church.” This is most true; for by being put to death outside\r\nthe Church, he is proved not to have had that charity of which the Apostle\r\nsays: “Though I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it\r\nprofiteth me nothing” [I Cor. 13:3]. But if martyrdom is of no avail for\r\nthe reason that charity is lacking, neither does it profit those who, as\r\nPaul says, and Cyprian further sets forth, are living within the Church\r\nwithout charity, in envy and malice; and yet they can both receive and\r\ntransmit true baptism. “Salvation,” he says, “is not without the Church.”\r\nWho denies this? And therefore whatever men have that belongs to the\r\nChurch, outside the Church it profits them nothing toward salvation. But\r\nit is one thing not to have, another to have it but to no use. He who has\r\nit not must be baptized that he may have it; he who has to no use must be\r\ncorrected, that what he has he may have to some use. Nor is the water in\r\nbaptism “adulterous,” because neither is the creature itself, which God\r\nmade, evil, nor is the fault to be found in the words of the Gospel in the\r\nmouths of any who are astray; but the fault is theirs in whom there is an\r\nadulterous spirit, even though it may receive the adornment of the\r\nsacrament from a lawful spouse. It therefore can be true that baptism is\r\n“common to us and to the heretics,” since the Gospel can be common to us,\r\nalthough their error differs from our faith; whether they think otherwise\r\nthan the truth about the Father or Son or the Holy Spirit; or, being cut\r\naway from unity, do not gather with Christ, but scatter abroad, because it\r\nis possible that the sacrament of baptism can be common to us if we are\r\nthe wheat of the Lord with the covetous within the Church and with robbers\r\nand drunkards and other pestilent persons, of whom it is said, “They shall\r\nnot inherit the kingdom of God,” and yet the vices by which they are\r\nseparated from the kingdom of God are not shared by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Augustine, _Ep. 98, ad Bonifatium_. (MSL, 33:363.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Relation of the sacrament to that of which it is the sign.\r\n    Sacraments are effective if no hinderance is placed to their\r\n    working.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday we say, “This day the Lord rose from the dead,” although\r\nso many years have passed since His resurrection.… The event itself being\r\nsaid to take place on that day, because, although it really took place\r\nlong before, it is on that day sacramentally celebrated. Was not Christ\r\nonce for all offered up in His own person as a sacrifice? And yet, is He\r\nnot likewise offered up in the sacrament as a sacrifice, not only in the\r\nspecial solemnities of Easter, but also daily among our congregations; so\r\nthat when a man is questioned and answers that He is offered as a\r\nsacrifice in that ordinance, does he not declare what is strictly true?\r\nFor if sacraments had not some points of real resemblance to the things of\r\nwhich they are the sacraments, they would not be sacraments at all.\r\n[Augustine’s general definition of a sacrament is that it is a sign of a\r\nsacred thing.] In most cases, moreover, they do, in virtue of this\r\nlikeness, bear the names of the realities which they resemble. As\r\ntherefore in a certain manner the sacrament of the body of Christ is the\r\nbody of Christ, the sacrament of the blood of Christ is the blood of\r\nChrist, so the sacrament of faith is faith.… Now, believing is nothing\r\nelse than having faith; and accordingly, when on behalf of an infant as\r\nyet incapable of exercising faith, the answer is given that he believes,\r\nthis answer means that he has faith because of the sacrament of faith, and\r\nin like manner the answer is made that he turns himself toward God because\r\nof the sacrament of conversion, since the answer itself belongs to the\r\ncelebration of the sacrament. Thus the Apostle says, in regard to this\r\nsacrament of baptism: “We are buried with Christ by baptism into death.”\r\nHe does not say, “We have signified our being buried with Him,” but: “We\r\nhave been buried with Him.” He has therefore given to the sacrament\r\npertaining to so great a transaction no other name than the word\r\ndescribing the transaction itself.\r\n\r\n10. Therefore an infant, although he is not yet a believer in the sense of\r\nhaving that faith which includes the consenting will of those who exercise\r\nit, nevertheless becomes a believer through the sacrament of that faith.…\r\nThe infant, though not yet possessing a faith helped by the understanding,\r\nis not obstructing(173) faith by an antagonism of the understanding, and\r\ntherefore receives with profit the sacrament of faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Augustine, _De Correctione Donatistarum_, §§ 22 _ff._ (MSL, 33:802.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The argument in favor of using force to compel the Donatists to\r\n    return to the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Augustine in the early part of the Donatist controversy was not in\r\n    favor of using force. Like the others, _e.g._, Optatus, he denied\r\n    that force had been employed by the Church. About 404 the\r\n    situation changed, and his opinion did likewise. This work, known\r\n    also as Epistle CLXXXV, was written circa 417. Compare Augustine’s\r\n    position with the statement of Jerome, “Piety for God is not\r\n    cruelty,” _cf._ Hagenbach, _History of Christian Doctrines_, §\r\n    135:7. The Donatists had much injured their position by their\r\n    treatment of a party which had produced a schism in their own\r\n    body, the Maximianists.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 22. Who can love us more than Christ who laid down His life for the\r\nsheep? And yet, after calling Peter and the other Apostles by His word\r\nalone, in the case of Paul, formerly Saul, the great builder of His\r\nChurch, but previously its cruel persecutor, He not only constrained him\r\nwith His voice, but even dashed him to the earth with His power.… Where is\r\nwhat they [the Donatists] are accustomed to cry: “To believe or not to\r\nbelieve is a matter that is free”? Toward whom did Christ use violence?\r\nWhom did He compel? Here they have the Apostle Paul. Let them recognize in\r\nhis case Christ’s first compelling and afterward teaching; first striking\r\nand afterward consoling. For it is wonderful how he who had been compelled\r\nby bodily punishment entered into the Gospel and afterward labored more in\r\nthe Gospel than all they who were called by word only; and the greater\r\nfear compelled him toward love, that perfect love which casts out fear.\r\n\r\n§ 23. Why, therefore, should not the Church compel her lost sons to return\r\nif the lost sons compelled others to perish? Although even men whom they\r\nhave not compelled but only led astray, their loving mother embraces with\r\nmore affection if they are recalled to her bosom through the enforcement\r\nof terrible but salutary laws, and are the objects of far more deep\r\ncongratulation than those whom she has never lost. Is it not a part of the\r\ncare of the shepherd, when any sheep have left the flock, even though not\r\nviolently forced away, but led astray by soft words and by coaxings, and\r\nthey have begun to be possessed by strangers, to bring them back to the\r\nfold of his master when he has found them, by the terrors or even the\r\npains of the whip, if they wish to resist; especially since, if they\r\nmultiply abundantly among the fugitive slaves and robbers, he has the more\r\nright in that the mark of the master is recognized on them, which is not\r\noutraged in those whom we receive but do not baptize?(174) So indeed is\r\nthe error of the sheep to be corrected that the sign of the Redeemer shall\r\nnot be marred. For if any one is marked with the royal stamp by a\r\ndeserter, who has himself been marked with it, and they receive\r\nforgiveness, and the one returns to his service, and the other begins to\r\nbe in the service in which he had not yet been, that mark is not effaced\r\nin either of them, but rather it is recognized in both, and approved with\r\ndue honor because it is the king’s. Since they cannot show that that is\r\nbad to which they are compelled,(175) they maintained that they ought not\r\nto be compelled to the good. But we have shown that Paul was compelled by\r\nChrist; therefore the Church in compelling the Donatists is following the\r\nexample of her Lord, though in the first instance she waited in hopes of\r\nnot having to compel any, that the prediction might be fulfilled\r\nconcerning the faith of kings and peoples.\r\n\r\n§ 24. For in this sense also we may interpret without absurdity the\r\napostolic declaration when the blessed Apostle Paul says: “Being ready to\r\nrevenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled” [II Cor.\r\n10:6]. Whence also the Lord himself bids the guests to be brought first to\r\nHis great supper, and afterward compelled; for when His servants answered\r\nHim, “Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room,” He\r\nsaid to them: “Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come\r\nin” [Luke 14:22, 23]. In those, therefore, who were first brought in with\r\ngentleness the former obedience is fulfilled, but in those who were\r\ncompelled the disobedience is avenged. For what else is the meaning of\r\n“Compel them to come in,” after it had previously been said, “Bring in,”\r\nand the answer was: “Lord, it is done as Thou commandest, and yet there is\r\nroom”? Wherefore if by the power which the Church has received by divine\r\nappointment in its due season, through the religious character and faith\r\nof kings, those who are found in the highways and hedges—that is, in\r\nheresies and schisms—are compelled to come in, then let them not find\r\nfault because they are compelled, but consider to what they are so\r\ncompelled. The supper of the Lord, the unity, is of the body of Christ,\r\nnot only in the sacrament of the altar but also in the bond of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Augustine, _Contra epistulam Parmeniani_, II, 13 (29). (MSL, 43:71.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Indelibility of baptism.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Parmenianus was the Donatist bishop who succeeded Donatus in the\r\n    see of Carthage. The letter here answered was written to\r\n    Tychonius, a leading Donatist. In it Parmenianus calls the Church\r\n    defiled because it contained unworthy members. The answer of\r\n    Augustine was written in 400, many years later.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one, either a deserter or one who has never served as a soldier,\r\nsigns any private person with the military mark, would not he who has\r\nsigned be punished as a deserter, when he has been arrested, and so much\r\nthe more severely as it could be proved that he had never at all served as\r\na soldier, and at the same time along with him would not the most impudent\r\ngiver of the sign, be punished if he have surrendered him? Or perchance he\r\ntakes no military service, but is afraid of the military mark\r\n[_character_] in his body, and he betakes himself to the clemency of the\r\nEmperor, and when he has poured forth prayers and obtained forgiveness, he\r\nthen begins to undertake military service, when the man has been liberated\r\nand corrected is that mark [_character_] ever repeated, and not rather is\r\nhe not recognized and approved? Would the Christian sacraments by chance\r\nbe less enduring than this bodily mark, since we see that apostates do not\r\nlack baptism, and to them it is never given again when they return by\r\nmeans of penitence, and therefore it is judged not possible to lose it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Augustine, _Contra epistulam Manichæi_, ch. 4 (5). (MSL, 42:175.)\r\n_Cf._ Mirbt, n. 132.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Authority of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This work, written in 396 or 397, is important in this connection\r\n    as showing the place the Catholic Church took in the mind of\r\n    Augustine as an authority and the nature of that authority.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot to speak of that wisdom which you [the Manichæans] do not believe to\r\nbe in the Catholic Church, there are many other things which most justly\r\nkeep me in her bosom. The consent of people and nations keeps me in the\r\nChurch; so does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by hope,\r\nenlarged by love, established by age. The succession of priests keeps me,\r\nbeginning from the very seat of Peter the Apostle, to whom the Lord after\r\nHis resurrection gave it in charge to feed His sheep down to the present\r\nepiscopate. And so lastly does the name itself of Catholic, which not\r\nwithout reason, amid so many heresies, that Church alone has so retained\r\nthat, though all heretics wish to be called Catholics, yet when a stranger\r\nasks where the Catholic Church meets no heretic will venture to point to\r\nhis own basilica or house. Since then so many and so great are the very\r\nprecious ties belonging to the Christian name which rightly keep a man who\r\nis a believer in the Catholic Church … no one shall move me from the faith\r\nwhich binds my mind with ties so many and so strong to the Christian\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nLet us see what Manichæus teaches us; and in particular let us examine\r\nthat treatise which you call the Fundamental Epistle in which almost all\r\nthat you believe is contained. For in that unhappy time when we read it,\r\nwe were called by you enlightened. The epistle begins: “Manichæus, an\r\napostle of Jesus Christ, by the providence of God the Father. These are\r\nwholesome words from the perennial and living fountain.” Now, if you\r\nplease, patiently give heed to my inquiry. I do not believe that he is an\r\napostle of Christ. Do not, I beg of you, be enraged and begin to curse.\r\nYou know that it is my rule not to believe without consideration anything\r\noffered by you. “Wherefore I ask, who is this Manichæus?” You reply, “An\r\napostle of Christ.” I do not believe it. Now you are at a loss what to say\r\nor do; for you promised to give me knowledge of the truth, and you force\r\nme to believe something I do not know. Perhaps you will read the Gospel to\r\nme, and from it you will attempt to defend the person of Manichæus. But\r\nshould you meet with a person not yet believing the Gospel, what could you\r\nreply to him if he said to you: “I do not believe”? For my part I should\r\nnot believe the Gospel except the authority of the Catholic Church moved\r\nme. So then I have assented to them when they say to me, “Believe the\r\nGospel”; why should I not assent to them saying to me: “Do not believe the\r\nManichæans”?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 84. The Pelagian Controversy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pelagian controversy, in which the characteristic teaching of\r\nAugustine found its best expression, may be divided into three periods. In\r\nthe first period, beginning about 411, Pelagius and Cælestius, who had\r\nbeen teaching at Rome unmolested since 400 and had come to Carthage,\r\nprobably on account of the barbarian attack upon Rome, are opposed at\r\nCarthage, and six propositions attributed to Cælestius are condemned at a\r\ncouncil there, where he attempted to be ordained. Cælestius leaves for the\r\nEast and is ordained at Ephesus, 412, and Pelagius soon after follows him.\r\nIn the second period, 415-417, the controversy is in the East as well as\r\nin the West, as Augustine by letters to Jerome gave warning about\r\nPelagius, and councils are held at Jerusalem and Diospolis, where Pelagius\r\nis acquitted of heresy. This was probably due as much to the general\r\nsympathy of the Eastern theologians with his doctrine as to any alleged\r\nmisrepresentation by Pelagius. But in North Africa synods are also held\r\ncondemning Pelagius, and their findings are approved by Innocent of Rome.\r\nBut Pelagius and Cælestius send confessions of faith to Zosimus (417-418),\r\nInnocent’s successor, who reproves the Africans and acquits Pelagius and\r\nCælestius as entirely sound. In the third period, 417-431, the attack on\r\nPelagius is taken up at Rome itself by some of the clergy, and an imperial\r\nedict is obtained against the Pelagians. Zosimus changes his opinion and\r\napproves the findings of a general council called at Carthage in 418, in\r\nwhich the doctrines of original sin and the need of grace are asserted.\r\nThe last act of the controversy in its earlier form, after the deposition\r\nof the leading Pelagians, among them Julian, of Eclanum, their theologian,\r\nis the condemnation of Pelagius at the Council of Ephesus, in 431. _V.\r\ninfra_, § 89.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: See A. Bruckner, _Quellen zur\r\n    Geschichte des pelagianischen Streites_ (in Latin), in Krüger’s\r\n    _Quellenschriften_, Freiburg-im-Breisgau, 1906. The principal\r\n    works of Augustine bearing on the Pelagian controversy may be\r\n    found in PNF, ser. I, vol. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Augustine, _Ep. 146, ad Pelagium_. (MSL, 33:596.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    This was probably written before the controversy. As to its use\r\n    later, see Augustine, _De gestis Pelagii_, chs. 51 (26) _f._ (PNF)\r\n\r\n\r\nI thank you very much that you have been so kind as to make me glad by\r\nyour letter informing me of your welfare. May the Lord recompense you with\r\nthose blessings that you forever be good and may live eternally with Him\r\nwho is eternal, my lord greatly beloved and brother greatly longed for.\r\nAlthough I do not acknowledge that anything in me deserves the eulogies\r\nwhich the letter of your benevolence contains about me, I cannot, however,\r\nbe ungrateful for the good-will therein manifested toward one so\r\ninsignificant, while suggesting at the same time that you should rather\r\npray for me that I may be made by the Lord such as you suppose me already\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Augustine. _De Peccatorum Meritis et Remissione et de Baptismo\r\nParvulorum_. (MSL, 44:185, 188.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Augustine’s testimony as to the character of Pelagius.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This work was written in 412, after the condemnation of Cælestius\r\n    at Carthage. It was the first in the series of polemical writings\r\n    against the teaching of Pelagius. The first book is especially\r\n    important as a statement of Augustine’s position as to the nature\r\n    of justifying grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n    It should be recalled that Pelagius was a monk of exemplary life,\r\n    and a zealous preacher of morality. It may be said that in him the\r\n    older moralistic tendency in theology was embodied in opposition\r\n    to the new religious spirit of Augustine. _Cf._ Bruckner, _op.\r\n    cit._, n. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. 1. However, within the last few days I have read some writings of\r\nPelagius, a holy man, as I hear, who has made no small progress in the\r\nChristian life, and these writings contain very brief expositions of the\r\nEpistles of Paul the Apostle.(176)\r\n\r\nIII. 3. But we must not omit that this good and praiseworthy man (as they\r\nwho know him describe him as being) has not advanced this argument against\r\nthe natural transmission of sin in his own person.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Pelagius, _Fragments_, in Augustine’s _De Gratia Christi et de\r\nPeccato Originali_. (MSL, 44:364, 379.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The teaching of Pelagius can be studied not only in his opponent’s\r\n    statements but in his own words. These are to be found in his\r\n    commentary (see note to previous selection), and also in fragments\r\n    found in Augustine’s writings and several minor pieces (see\r\n    below).\r\n\r\n\r\nI. 7. Very ignorant persons think that we do wrong in this matter to\r\ndivine grace, because we say that it by no means perfects sanctity in us\r\nwithout our will: as if God could impose any commands upon His grace and\r\nwould not supply also the help of His grace to those to whom He has given\r\ncommands, so that men might more easily accomplish through grace what they\r\nare required to do by their free will. And this grace we do not for our\r\npart, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also in the\r\nhelp of God. God helps us by His teaching and revelation when He opens the\r\neyes of our heart; when He points out to us the future, that we may not be\r\nabsorbed in the present; when He discovers to us the snares of the devil;\r\nwhen He enlightens us with manifold and ineffable gifts of heavenly grace.\r\nDoes the man who says this appear to you to be a denier of grace? Does he\r\nnot acknowledge both man’s free will and God’s grace?\r\n\r\nI. 39. Speaking of the text Rom. 7:23: “But I see another law in my\r\nmembers, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into\r\ncaptivity to the law of sin which is in my members.”\r\n\r\nNow what you [_i.e._, Augustine, whom he is addressing] wish us to\r\nunderstand of the Apostle himself, all Church writers assert that he spoke\r\nin the person of the sinner, and of one still under the law, who by reason\r\nof very long custom of vice was held bound, as it were, by a certain\r\nnecessity of sinning, and who, although he desired good with his will in\r\npractice, indeed, was driven into evil. In the person, however, of one man\r\nthe Apostle designates the people who sinned still under the ancient law,\r\nand this people, he declares, are to be delivered from this evil of custom\r\nthrough Christ, who first of all remits all sins in baptism, to those who\r\nbelieve on Him, and then by an imitation of Himself incites them to\r\nperfect holiness, and by the example of virtues overcomes the evil custom\r\nof sins.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Pelagius, _Epistula ad Demetriadem_. (MSL, 33:1100 _ff._)\r\n\r\n\r\n    This epistle, from which selections are given, was written\r\n    probably about 412 or 413. As it gives a statement of the teaching\r\n    of Pelagius in his own words, it is of especial historical\r\n    interest. Demetrias was a virgin, and probably under the spiritual\r\n    direction of Pelagius, though little is known of her. Text in\r\n    Bruckner, _op. cit._, n. 56.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 2. As often as I have to speak of the principles of virtue and a holy\r\nlife, I am accustomed first of all to call attention to the capacity and\r\ncharacter of human nature, and to show what it is able to accomplish; then\r\nfrom this to arouse the feelings of the hearer, that he may strive after\r\ndifferent kinds of virtue, that he may permit himself to be roused to acts\r\nwhich perhaps he had regarded as impossible. For we are quite unable to\r\ntravel the way of virtue if hope does not accompany us. For all attempts\r\nto accomplish anything cease if one is in doubt whether he will attain the\r\ngoal. This order of exhortation I follow in other minor writings and in\r\nthis case also. I believe it must be kept especially in mind where the\r\ngood of nature needs to be set forth the more in detail as the life is to\r\nbe more perfectly formed, that the spirit may not be more neglectful and\r\nslow in its striving after virtue, as it believes itself to have the less\r\nability, and when it is ignorant of what is within it, think that it does\r\nnot possess it.\r\n\r\nCh. 3. One must be careful to see to it that … one does not think that a\r\nman is not made good because he can do evil and is not compelled to an\r\nimmutable necessity of doing good through the might of nature. For if you\r\ndiligently consider it and turn your mind to the subtler understanding of\r\nthe matter, the better and superior position of man will appear in that\r\nfrom which his inferior condition was inferred. But just in this freedom\r\nin either direction, in this liberty toward either side, is placed the\r\nglory of our rational nature. Therein, I say, consists the entire honor of\r\nour nature, therein its dignity; from this the very good merit praise,\r\nfrom this their reward. For there would be for those who always remain\r\ngood no virtue if they had not been able to have chosen the evil. For\r\nsince God wished to present to the rational creature the gift of voluntary\r\ngoodness and the power of the free will, by planting in man the\r\npossibility of turning himself toward either side, He made His special\r\ngift the ability to be what he would be in order that he, being capable of\r\ngood and evil, could do either and could turn his will to either of them.\r\n\r\nCh. 8. We defend the advantage of nature not in the sense that we say it\r\ncannot do evil, since we declare that it is capable of good and evil; we\r\nonly protect it from reproach. It should not appear as if we were driven\r\nto evil by a disease of nature, we who do neither good nor bad without our\r\nwill, and to whom there is always freedom to do one of two things, since\r\nalways we are able to do both.… Nothing else makes it difficult for us to\r\ndo good than long custom of sinning which has infected us since we were\r\nchildren, and has gradually corrupted us for many years, so that afterward\r\nit holds us bound to it and delivered over to it, so that it almost seems\r\nas if it had the same force as nature.\r\n\r\nIf before the Law, as we are told, and long before the appearance of the\r\nRedeemer, various persons can be named who lived just and holy lives, how\r\nmuch more after His appearance must we believe that we are able to do the\r\nsame, we who have been taught through Christ’s grace, and born again to be\r\nbetter men; and we who by His blood have been reconciled and purified, and\r\nby His example incited to more perfect righteousness, ought to be better\r\nthan they who were before the Law, better than they who were under the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Marius Mercator, _Commonitorium super nomine Cælestii_, ch. 1. (MSL,\r\n48:67.) _Cf._ Kirch, nn. 737 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Council of Carthage and the opinions of Cælestius condemned at\r\n    that council, 411.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Marius Mercator, a friend and supporter of Augustine, was one of\r\n    the most determined opponents of Pelagianism, as also of\r\n    Nestorianism. His dates are not well determined. In 418 he sent\r\n    works to Augustine to be examined by the latter, and he seems to\r\n    have lived until after the Council of Chalcedon, 451. The work\r\n    from which the selection is taken was written, 429, in Greek, and\r\n    translated and republished in Latin, 431 or 432. With the\r\n    following should be compared Augustine’s _De Gratia Christi et\r\n    Peccato Originali_, II, 2_f._, and _Ep._ 175:6; 157:3, 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain Cælestius, a eunuch from his mother’s womb, a disciple and\r\nauditor of Pelagius, left Rome about twenty years ago and came to\r\nCarthage, the metropolis of all Africa, and there he was accused of the\r\nfollowing heads before Aurelius, bishop of that city, by a complaint from\r\na certain Paulinus, a deacon of Bishop Ambrose of Milan, of sacred memory,\r\nas the record of the acts stands in which the same complaint is inserted\r\n(a copy of the acts of the council we have in our hands) that he not only\r\ntaught this himself, but also sent in different directions throughout the\r\nprovinces those who agreed with him to disseminate among the people these\r\nthings, that is:\r\n\r\n1. Adam was made mortal and would have died whether he had sinned or had\r\nnot sinned.\r\n\r\n2. The sin of Adam injured himself alone, and not the human race.\r\n\r\n3. New-born children are in that state in which Adam was before his fall.\r\n\r\n4. Neither by the death and sin of Adam does the whole race die, nor by\r\nthe resurrection of Christ does the whole race rise.\r\n\r\n5. The Law leads to the kingdom of heaven as well as the Gospel.\r\n\r\n6. Even before the coming of the Lord there were men without sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Pelagius. _Confessio fidei_. (MSL, 45:1716 _f._) Hahn, § 209.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The confession of faith addressed to Innocent of Rome, but\r\n    actually laid before Zosimus, in 417, consists of an admirably\r\n    orthodox statement of the doctrine of the Trinity and of the\r\n    incarnation, an expansion of the Nicene formula with reference to\r\n    perversions of the faith by various heretics, and in conclusion a\r\n    statement of Pelagius’s own opinions regarding free will, grace,\r\n    and sin. It is due to the irony of history that it should have\r\n    been found among the works of both Jerome and Augustine, long\r\n    passed current as a composition of Augustine, _Sermo CCXXXVI_, and\r\n    should have been actually quoted by the Sorbonne, in 1521, in its\r\n    articles against Luther. It also appears in the _Libri Carolini_,\r\n    III, 1, as an orthodox exposition of the faith. The passages which\r\n    bear upon the characteristic Pelagian doctrine are here given.\r\n    Fragments of the confessions of other Pelagians, _e.g._,\r\n    Cælestius, and Julius of Eclanum, are found in Hahn, §§ 210 and\r\n    211. For the proceedings in the East, see Hefele, § 118.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold that there is one baptism, which we assert is to be administered\r\nto children in the same words of the sacrament as it is administered to\r\nadults.…\r\n\r\nWe execrate also the blasphemy of those who say that anything impossible\r\nto do is commanded man by God, and the commands of God can be observed,\r\nnot by individuals but by all in common, also those who with the\r\nManichæans condemn first marriages or with the Cataphrygians condemn\r\nsecond marriages.… We so confess the will is free that we say that we\r\nalways need the aid of God, and they err who with the Manichæans assert\r\nthat man cannot avoid sins as well as those who with Jovinan say that man\r\ncannot sin; for both take away the liberty of the will. But we say that\r\nman can both sin and not sin, so that we confess that we always have free\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Augustine, _Sermo_ 131. (MSL, 38:734.) _Cf._ Kirch, n. 672.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Causa finita est._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Late in 416 synods were held in Carthage and Mileve condemning\r\n    Pelagianism. On January 27, 417, Innocent wrote to the Africans,\r\n    approving their councils and condemning Pelagianism, incidentally\r\n    stating the supreme authority of the Roman See and requiring that\r\n    nothing should ever be definitively settled without consulting the\r\n    Apostolic See (text of passage in Denziger. ed. 1911, n. 100).\r\n    September 23 of the same year, about the time when Pelagius and\r\n    Cælestius were at Rome with Zosimus seeking to rehabilitate\r\n    themselves in the West, Augustine delivered a sermon in which he\r\n    made the following statement. It is the basis of the famous phrase\r\n    _Roma locuta, causa finita est_, a saying which is apocryphal,\r\n    however, and not found in the works of Augustine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, therefore, is said concerning the Jews, that we see in them [_i.e._,\r\nthe Pelagians]. They have the zeal for God; I bear witness, that they have\r\na zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. Why is it not according to\r\nknowledge? Because, being ignorant of the justice of God and wishing to\r\nestablish their own, they are not subject to the righteousness of God\r\n[Rom. 10:2 _f._]. My brethren, have patience with me.\r\n\r\nWhen you find such, do not conceal them, let there be not false mercy in\r\nyou. Most certainly when you find such, do not conceal them. Refute those\r\ncontradicting, and those resisting bring to me. For already two councils\r\nabout this case have been sent to the Apostolic See, whence also rescripts\r\nhave come. The case has been ended; would that the error might some time\r\nend! Therefore let us warn them that they pay attention; let us teach them\r\nthat they may be instructed; let us pray that they may be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Zosimus, III _Ep. ad Episcopos Africæ de causa Cælestii_ A. D. 417.\r\n(MSL, 45:1721.) _Cf._ Bruckner, _op. cit._, n. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fragments of his later _Epistula tractoria_ together with other\r\n    letters may be found in Bruckner, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n\r\nLikewise Pelagius sent letters also containing an extended justification\r\nof himself, to which he added a profession of his faith, what he condemned\r\nand what he followed, without any dissimulation, so that all subtilities\r\nof interpretation might be avoided. There was a public recitation of\r\nthese. They contained all things like those which Cælestius had previously\r\npresented and expressed in the same sense and drawn up in the same\r\nthoughts. Would that some of you, dearest brethren, could have been\r\npresent at the reading of the letters. What was the joy of the holy men\r\nwho were present; what was the admiration of each of them! Some of them\r\ncould scarcely restrain themselves from tears and weeping, that such men\r\nof absolutely correct faith could have been suspected. Was there a single\r\nplace in which the grace of God or his aid was omitted?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_i_) Council of Carthage, A. D. 418, _Canons_. Bruns, I, 188.\r\n\r\n\r\n    These canons of the Council of Carthage, A. D. 418, were\r\n    incorporated in the _Codex Canon Ecclesiæ Africanæ_ adopted at the\r\n    Council of Carthage A. D. 419. The numbers given in brackets are\r\n    the numbers in that Codex. Interprovincial councils were known in\r\n    North Africa as “general councils.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the consulate of the most glorious emperors, Honorius for the twelfth\r\ntime and Theodosius for the eighth, on the calends of May, at Carthage in\r\nthe Secretarium of the Basilica of Faustus, when Bishop Aurelius presided\r\nover the general council, the deacons standing by, it pleased all the\r\nbishops, whose names and subscriptions are indicated, met together in the\r\nholy synod of the church of Carthage:\r\n\r\n1 [109]. That whosoever should say that Adam, the first man, was created\r\nmortal, so that whether he had sinned or not, he would have died in the\r\nbody—that is, he would have gone forth of the body, not because of the\r\ndesert [or merit] of sin, but by natural necessity, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n2 [110]. Likewise that whosoever denies that infants newly from their\r\nmother’s womb should be baptized, or says that baptism is for remission of\r\nsins, but that they derive from Adam no original sin, which is removed by\r\nthe layer of regeneration, whence the conclusion follows that in them the\r\nform of baptism for the remission of sins is to be understood as false and\r\nnot true, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nFor not otherwise can be understood what the Apostle says, “By one man sin\r\nhas come into the world,(177) and so it passed upon all men in that all\r\nhave sinned,” than as the Catholic Church everywhere diffused has always\r\nunderstood it. For on account of this rule of faith, even infants, who\r\ncould have committed no sin themselves, therefore are truly baptized for\r\nthe remission of sins, in order that what in them is the result of\r\ngeneration may be cleansed by regeneration.\r\n\r\n3 [111]. Likewise, that whoever should say that the grace of God, by which\r\na man is justified through Jesus Christ our Lord, avails only for the\r\nremission of past sins, and not for assistance against committing sins in\r\nthe future, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n4 [112]. Also, whoever shall say that the same grace of God through Jesus\r\nChrist our Lord helps us not to sin only in that by it are revealed to us\r\nand opened to our understanding the commandments, so that we may know what\r\nto seek, what we ought to avoid, and also that we should love to do so,\r\nbut that through it we are not helped so that we are able to do what we\r\nknow we should do, let him be anathema. For when the Apostle says, “Wisdom\r\npuffeth up, but charity edifieth,” it were truly infamous were we to\r\nbelieve that we have the grace of Christ for that which puffeth us up, but\r\nhave it not for that which edifieth, since each is the gift of God, both\r\nto know what we ought to do, and to love it so as to do it; so that wisdom\r\ncannot puff us up while charity is edifying us. For as it is written of\r\nGod, “Who teacheth man knowledge,” so also it is written, “Love is of\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\n5 [113]. It seemed good that whosoever should say that the grace of\r\njustification is given to us only that we might be able more readily by\r\ngrace to perform what we were commanded to do through our free will; as if\r\nwhen grace was not given, although not easily, yet nevertheless we could\r\neven without grace fulfil the divine commandments, let him be anathema.\r\nFor the Lord spake concerning the fruits of the commandments, when he\r\nsaid, “Without me ye can do nothing,” and not “Without me ye can do it but\r\nwith difficulty.”\r\n\r\n6 [114]. It seemed also good that as St. John the Apostle says, “If ye\r\nshall say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not\r\nin us”; whosoever thinks that this should be so understood as to mean that\r\nout of humility we ought to say that we have sin, and not because it is\r\nreally so, let him be anathema. For the Apostle goes on to add, “But if we\r\nconfess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to\r\ncleanse us from all iniquity,” where it is sufficiently clear that this is\r\nsaid not only in humility but also in truth. For the Apostle might have\r\nsaid, “If we shall say we have no sins we shall extol ourselves, and\r\nhumility is not in us”; but when he says, “we deceive ourselves and the\r\ntruth is not in us,” he sufficiently intimates that he who affirmed that\r\nhe had no sin would speak not that which is true but that which is false.\r\n\r\n7 [115]. It has seemed good that whosoever should say that when in the\r\nLord’s Prayer, the saints say, “Forgive us our trespasses,” they say this\r\nnot for themselves, because they have no need of this petition, but for\r\nthe rest who are sinners of the people; and that therefore none of the\r\nsaints can say, “Forgive me my trespasses,” but “Forgive us our\r\ntrespasses”; so that the just is understood to seek this for others rather\r\nthan for himself, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n8 [116]. Likewise it seemed good, that whosoever asserts that these words\r\nof the Lord’s Prayer when they say, “Forgive us our trespasses,” are said\r\nby the saints out of humility and not in truth, let them be anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following canon, although it seems to have been enacted for\r\n    the case of Apiarius, is nevertheless often cited in the same\r\n    connection as the eight against Pelagius, and is therefore given\r\n    here for the sake of convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n18 [125]. Likewise, it seemed good that presbyters, deacons, or other of\r\nthe lower clergy who are to be tried, if they question the decision of\r\ntheir bishops, the neighboring bishops having been invited by them with\r\nthe consent of their bishops shall hear them and determine whatever\r\nseparates them. But should they think that an appeal should be carried\r\nfrom them, let them not carry the appeal except to African councils or to\r\nthe primates of their provinces. But whoso shall think of carrying an\r\nappeal across the seas, shall be admitted to communion by no one in\r\nAfrica.(178)\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 85. Semi-Pelagian Controversy\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the condemnation of Pelagianism the doctrine of Augustine in its\r\nlogically worked out details was not necessarily approved. The necessity\r\nof baptism for the remission of sins in all cases was approved as well as\r\nthe necessity of grace. The doctrine of predestination, an essential\r\nfeature in the Augustinian system, was not only not accepted but was\r\nvigorously opposed by many who heartily condemned Pelagianism. The ensuing\r\ndiscussion, known as the Semi-Pelagian controversy (427-529), was largely\r\ncarried on in Gaul, which after the Vandal occupation of North Africa,\r\nbecame the intellectual centre of the Church in the West. The leading\r\nopponent of Augustine was John Cassian (ob. 435), abbot of a monastery at\r\nMarseilles, hence the term Massilians applied to his party, and his pupil,\r\nVincent of Lerins, author of _Commonitorium_, written 434. The chief\r\nAugustinians were Hilary and Prosper of Aquitaine. The discussion was not\r\ncontinuous. About 475 it broke out again when Lucidus was condemned at a\r\ncouncil at Lyons and forced to retract his predestinarian views; and again\r\nabout 520. The matter received what is regarded as its solution in the\r\nCouncil of Orange, 529, confirmed by Boniface II in 531. By the decrees of\r\nthis council so much of the Augustinian system as could be combined with\r\nthe teaching and practice of the Church as to the sacraments was formally\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) John Cassian. _Collationes_, XIII. 7 _ff._ (MSL, 49:908.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    John Cassian, born about 360, was by birth and education a man of\r\n    the East, and does not appear in the West until 405, when he went\r\n    to Rome on some business connected with the exile of Chrysostom,\r\n    his friend and patron. In 415 he established two monasteries at\r\n    Marseilles, one for men and the other for women. He had himself\r\n    been educated as a monk and made a careful study of monasticism in\r\n    Egypt and Palestine. Western monasticism is much indebted to him\r\n    for his writings. _De Institutis Cœnobiorum_ and the\r\n    _Collationes_. In the former, he describes the monastic system of\r\n    Palestine and Egypt and the principal vices to which the monastic\r\n    life is liable; in the latter, divided into three parts, Cassian\r\n    gives reports or what purports to be reports of conversations he\r\n    and his friend Germanus had with Egyptian ascetics. These books\r\n    were very popular during the Middle Ages and exerted a wide\r\n    influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 7. When His [God’s] kindness sees in us even the very smallest spark\r\nof good-will shining forth or which He himself has, as it were, struck out\r\nfrom the hard flints of our hearts, He fans it and fosters it and nurses\r\nit with His breath, as He “will have all men to be saved and to come unto\r\nthe knowledge of the truth” [I Tim. 2:4].… For He is true and lieth not\r\nwhen He lays down with an oath: “As I live, saith the Lord, I will not the\r\ndeath of a sinner, but that he should turn from his way and live” [Ezek.\r\n33:11]. For if he willeth not that one of His little ones should perish,\r\nhow can we think without grievous blasphemy that He willeth not all men\r\nuniversally, but only some instead of all be saved. Those then who perish,\r\nperish against His will, as He testifieth against each of them day by day:\r\n“Turn from your evil ways for why will ye die, O house of Israel?” [Ezek.\r\n33:11] … The grace of Christ is then at hand every day, which, while it\r\n“willeth all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth,”\r\ncalleth all without exception, saying: “Come all unto me all ye that labor\r\nand are heavy laden and I will give you rest” [Matt. 11:28]. But if he\r\ncalls not all generally but only some, it follows that not all are heavy\r\nladen with either original sin or actual sin, and that this saying is not\r\na true one: “For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God” [Rom.\r\n3:23]; nor can we believe that “death passed on all men” [Rom. 5:12]. And\r\nso far do all who perish, perish against the will of God, that God cannot\r\nbe said to have made death, as the Scripture itself testifieth: “For God\r\nmade not death, neither hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living”\r\n[Wisdom 1:13].\r\n\r\nCh. 8. When He sees anything of good-will arisen in us He at once\r\nenlightens it and strengthens it and urges it on to salvation, giving\r\nincrease to that which He himself implanted or He sees to have arisen by\r\nour own effort.\r\n\r\nCh. 9. … But that it may be still more evident that through the good of\r\nnature, which is bestowed by the kindness of the Creator, sometimes the\r\nbeginnings of a good-will arise, yet cannot come to the completion of\r\nvirtue unless they are directed by the Lord, the Apostle is a witness,\r\nsaying: “For to will is present with me, but to perform what is good I\r\nfind not” [Rom. 7:18].\r\n\r\nCh. 11. … If we say that the beginnings of a good-will are always inspired\r\nin us by the grace of God, what shall we say about the faith of Zacchæus,\r\nor of the piety of that thief upon the cross, who by their own desire\r\nbrought violence to bear upon the Kingdom of Heaven, and so anticipated\r\nthe special leadings of their callings?…\r\n\r\nCh. 12. We should not hold that God made man such that he neither wills\r\nnor is able to do good. Otherwise He has not granted him a free will, if\r\nHe has suffered him only to will or be capable of evil, but of himself\r\nneither to will nor be capable of what is good.… It cannot, therefore, be\r\ndoubted that there are by nature seeds of goodness implanted in every soul\r\nby the kindness of the Creator; but unless these are quickened by the\r\nassistance of God, they will not be able to attain to an increase of\r\nperfection; for, as the blessed Apostle says: “Neither is he that planteth\r\nanything nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase” [I Cor.\r\n3:7]. But that freedom of will is to some degree in a man’s power is very\r\nclearly taught in the book called _The Pastor_,(179) where two angels are\r\nsaid to be attached to each one of us, _i.e._ a good and a bad one, while\r\nit lies in a man’s own option to choose which to follow. And, therefore,\r\nthe will always remains free in man, and it can either neglect or delight\r\nin the grace of God. For the Apostle would not have commanded, saying,\r\n“Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling” [Phil. 2:12], had he\r\nnot known that it could be advanced or neglected by us.… But that they\r\nshould not think that they did not need divine aid he adds: “For it is God\r\nwho worketh in you both to will and accomplish His good pleasure” [Phil.\r\n2:13]. The mercy of the Lord, therefore, goes before the will of man, for\r\nit is said, “My God will prevent me with His mercy” [Psalm 59:10], and\r\nagain, that He may put our desire to the test, our will goes before God\r\nwho waits, and for our good delays.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Vincent of Lerins, _Commonitorium_, chs. 2, 23, 26, (MSL, 50:659.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The rule of Catholic verity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Vincent of Lerins wrote his _Commonitorium_ in 434, three years\r\n    after the death of Augustine, who had been commended in 432 to the\r\n    clergy of Gaul by Celestine of Rome [_Ep._ 21; Denziger, nn.\r\n    128-142; Mansi IV, 454 _ff._]. Vincent attacked Augustine in his\r\n    _Commonitorium_, not openly, but, so far as the work has been\r\n    preserved, covertly, under the pseudonym of Peregrinus. The work\r\n    consists of two books, of which the second is lost with the\r\n    exception of what appear to be some concluding chapters, or a\r\n    summary taking the place of the book. In the first book he lays\r\n    down the general principle as to the tests of Catholic truth. In\r\n    doing so he is careful to point out several cases of very great\r\n    teachers, renowned for learning, ability, and influence, who,\r\n    nevertheless, erred against the test of Catholic truth, and\r\n    brought forward opinions which, on account of their novelty, were\r\n    false. It is a working out in detail of the principles of the idea\r\n    of Tertullian in his _De Prœscriptione_ [_v. supra_, § 27]. The\r\n    Augustinian doctrines of predestination and grace could not stand\r\n    the test of the appeal to antiquity. After laying down his test of\r\n    truth it appears to have been the author’s intention to prove\r\n    thereby the doctrine of Augustine false. The so-called “Vincentian\r\n    rule” is often quoted without a thought that it was intended,\r\n    primarily, as an attack upon Augustine. The _Commonitorium_ may be\r\n    found translated in PNF, ser. II, vol. XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 2 [4]. I have often inquired earnestly and attentively of very many\r\nmen eminent for sanctity and learning, how and by what sure and, so to\r\nspeak, universal rule I might be able to distinguish the truth of the\r\nCatholic faith from the falsehood of heretical pravity, and I have always,\r\nand from nearly all, received an answer to this effect: That whether I or\r\nany one else should wish to detect the frauds of heretics as they arise,\r\nor to avoid their snares, and to continue sound and complete in the faith,\r\nwe must, the Lord helping, fortify our faith in two ways: first, by the\r\nauthority of the divine Law, and then, by the tradition of the Catholic\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nBut here some one, perhaps, will ask: Since the canon of Scripture is\r\ncomplete and sufficient for everything, and more than sufficient, what\r\nneed is there to add to it the authority of the Church’s interpretation?\r\nFor this reason: because, owing to the depth of Holy Scripture, all do not\r\naccept it in one and the same sense, but one understands its words one\r\nway, another in another way; so that almost as many opinions may be drawn\r\nfrom it as there are men.… Therefore it is very necessary, on account of\r\nso great intricacies, and of such various errors, that the rule of a right\r\nunderstanding of the prophets and Apostles should be framed in accordance\r\nwith the standard of ecclesiastical and Catholic interpretation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the Catholic Church itself all possible care should be taken\r\nthat we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, and by\r\nall. For that is truly and properly “Catholic” which, as the name implies\r\nand the reason of the thing declares, comprehends all universally. This\r\nwill be the case if we follow universality, antiquity, and consent. We\r\nshall follow universality in this way, if we confess that one faith to be\r\ntrue which the whole Church throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if\r\nwe in nowise depart from those interpretations which it is manifest were\r\nnotoriously held by our holy ancestors and fathers; consent in like\r\nmanner, if in antiquity itself we adhere to the consentient definitions\r\nand determinations of all, or at least almost all, priests and doctors.\r\n\r\nCh. 23 [59]. The Church of Christ, the careful and watchful guardian of\r\nthe doctrines deposited in her charge, never changes anything in them,\r\nnever diminishes, never adds; does not cut off what is necessary, does not\r\nadd what is superfluous, does not lose her own, does not appropriate what\r\nis another’s, but, while dealing faithfully and judiciously with ancient\r\ndoctrine, keeps this one object carefully in view—if there be anything\r\nwhich antiquity has left shapeless and rudimentary, to fashion and to\r\npolish it; if anything already reduced to shape and developed, to\r\nconsolidate and strengthen it; if any already ratified and defined, to\r\nkeep and guard it. Finally, what other objects have councils ever aimed at\r\nin their decrees, than to provide that what was before believed in\r\nsimplicity, should in the future be believed intelligently; that what was\r\nbefore preached coldly, should in the future be preached earnestly; that\r\nwhat before was practised negligently, should henceforth be practised with\r\ndouble solicitude?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Passage referring especially to Augustine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 26 [69]. But what do they say? “If thou be the Son of God, cast\r\nthyself down”; that is, “If thou wouldest be a son of God, and wouldest\r\nreceive the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven, cast thyself down; that\r\nis, cast thyself down from the doctrine and tradition of that sublime\r\nChurch, which is imagined to be nothing less than the very temple of God.”\r\nAnd if one should ask one of the heretics who gives this advice: How do\r\nyou prove it? What ground have you for saying that I ought to cast away\r\nthe universal and ancient faith of the Catholic Church? he has only the\r\nanswer ready: “For it is written”; and forthwith he produces a thousand\r\ntestimonies, a thousand examples, a thousand authorities from the Law,\r\nfrom the Psalms, from the Apostles, from the prophets, by means of which,\r\ninterpreted on a new and wrong principle, the unhappy soul is precipitated\r\nfrom the height of Catholic truth to the lowest abyss of heresy. Then with\r\nthe accompanying promises, the heretics are wont marvellously to beguile\r\nthe incautious. For they dare to teach and promise that in their church,\r\nthat is, in the conventicle of their communion, there is a certain great\r\nand special and altogether personal grace of God, so that whosoever\r\npertain to their number, without any labor, without any effort, without\r\nany industry, even though they neither ask, nor seek, nor knock,(180) have\r\nsuch a dispensation from God, that borne up of angel hands, that is,\r\npreserved by the protection of angels, it is impossible they should ever\r\ndash their feet against a stone, that is, that they should ever be\r\noffended.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Council of Orange, A. D. 529, _Canons_. Bruns II, 176. _Cf._\r\nDenziger, n. 174.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The end of the Semi-Pelagian controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Council of Orange, A. D. 529, was made up of several bishops\r\n    and some lay notables who had gathered for the dedication of a\r\n    church at Orange. Cæsarius of Arles had received from Felix IV of\r\n    Rome eight statements against the Semi-Pelagian teaching. He added\r\n    some more of his own to them, and had them passed as canons by the\r\n    company gathered for the dedication. It is noteworthy that the lay\r\n    notables signed along with the bishops. Boniface II, to whom the\r\n    canons were sent, confirmed them in 532: “We approve your above\r\n    written confession as agreeable to the Catholic rule of the\r\n    Fathers.” _Cf._ Hefele, § 242. For the sources of the canons, see\r\n    Seeberg, _History of Doctrines_, Eng. trans., I, 380, note 3. For\r\n    the sake of brevity the scriptural quotations are not given,\r\n    merely indicated by references to the Bible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 1. Whoever says that by the offence of the disobedience of Adam not\r\nthe entire man, that is, in body and soul, was changed for the worse, but\r\nthat the freedom of his soul remained uninjured, and his body only was\r\nsubject to corruption, has been deceived by the error of Pelagius and\r\nopposes Scripture [Ezek. 18:20; Rom. 6:16; II Peter 2:19].\r\n\r\nCanon 2. Whoever asserts that the transgression of Adam injured himself\r\nonly, and not his offspring, or that death only of the body, which is the\r\npenalty of sin, but not also sin, which is the death of the soul, passed\r\nby one man to the entire human race, wrongs God and contradicts the\r\nApostle [Rom. 5:12].\r\n\r\nCanon 3. Whoever says that the grace of God can be bestowed in reply to\r\nhuman petition, but not that the grace brings it about so that it is asked\r\nfor by us, contradicts Isaiah the prophet and the Apostle [Is. 65:1; Rom.\r\n10:20].\r\n\r\nCanon 4. Whoever contends that our will, to be set free from sin, may\r\nanticipate God’s action, and shall not confess that it is brought about by\r\nthe infusion of the Holy Spirit and his operation in us, that we wish to\r\nbe set free, resists that same Holy Spirit speaking through Solomon: “The\r\nwill is prepared by the Lord” [Proverbs 8:35, _cf._ LXX; not so in Vulgate\r\nor Heb.], and the Apostle [Phil. 2:13].\r\n\r\nCanon 5. Whoever says the increase, as also the beginning of faith and the\r\ndesire of believing, by which we believe in Him who justifies the impious,\r\nand we come to the birth of holy baptism, is not by the free gift of\r\ngrace, that is, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit turning our will\r\nfrom unbelief to belief, from impiety to piety, but belongs naturally to\r\nus, is declared an adversary of the apostolic preaching [Phil. 1:6; Ephes.\r\n2:8]. For they say that faith by which we believe in God is natural, and\r\nthey declare that all those who are strangers to the Church of Christ in\r\nsome way are believing.\r\n\r\nCanon 6. Whoever says that to us who, without the grace of God, believe,\r\nwill, desire, attempt, struggle for, watch, strive for, demand, ask,\r\nknock, mercy is divinely bestowed, and does not rather confess that it is\r\nbrought about by the infusion and inspiration of the Holy Spirit in us\r\nthat believe, will, and do all these other things as we ought, and annexes\r\nthe help of grace to human humility and obedience, and does not admit that\r\nit is the gift of that same grace that we are obedient and humble, opposes\r\nthe Apostle [I Cor. 4:7].\r\n\r\nCanon 7. Whoever asserts that by the force of nature we can rightly think\r\nor choose anything good, which pertains to eternal life, or be saved, that\r\nis, assent to the evangelical preaching, without the illumination of the\r\nHoly Spirit, who gives to all grace to assent to and believe the truth, is\r\ndeceived by an heretical spirit, not understanding the voice of the Lord\r\n[John 15:5], and of the Apostle [II Cor. 3:5].\r\n\r\nCanon 8. Whoever asserts that some by mercy, others by free will, which in\r\nall who have been born since the transgression of the first man is\r\nevidently corrupt, are able to come to the grace of baptism, is proved an\r\nalien from the faith. For he asserts that the free will of all has not\r\nbeen weakened by the sin of the first man, or he evidently thinks that it\r\nhas been so injured that some, however, are able without the revelation of\r\nGod to attain, by their own power, to the mystery of eternal salvation.\r\nBecause the Lord himself shows how false this is, who declares that not\r\nsome, but no one was able to come to Him unless the Father drew him [John\r\n6:4], and said so to Peter [Matt. 16:17] and the Apostle [I Cor. 12:3].\r\n\r\n\r\n    The canons that follow are less important. The whole concludes\r\n    with a brief statement regarding the points at issue, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so according to the above sentences of the Holy Scriptures and\r\ndefinitions of ancient Fathers, by God’s aid, we believe that we ought to\r\nbelieve and preach:\r\n\r\nThat by the sin of the first man, free will was so turned aside and\r\nweakened that afterward no one is able to love God as he ought, or believe\r\nin God, or do anything for God, which is good, except the grace of divine\r\nmercy comes first to him [Phil. 1:6, 29; Ephes. 2:8; I Cor. 4:7, 7:25;\r\nJames 1:17; John 3:27].…\r\n\r\nWe also believe this to be according to the Catholic faith, that grace\r\nhaving been received in baptism, all who have been baptized, can and\r\nought, by the aid and support of Christ, to perform those things which\r\nbelong to the salvation of the soul, if they labor faithfully.\r\n\r\nBut not only do we not believe that some have been predestinated to evil\r\nby the divine power, but also, if there are any who wish to believe so\r\nevil a thing, we say to them, with all detestation, anathema.\r\n\r\nAlso this we profitably confess and believe, that in every good we do not\r\nbegin and afterward are assisted by the mercy of God, but without any good\r\ndesert preceding, He first inspires in us faith and love in Him, so that\r\nwe both faithfully seek the sacrament of baptism, and after baptism with\r\nHis help are able to perform those things which are pleasing to Him.\r\nWhence it is most certainly to be believed that in the case of that thief,\r\nwhom the Lord called to the fatherland of paradise, and Cornelius the\r\nCenturion, to whom an angel of the Lord was sent, and Zacchæus, who was\r\nworthy of receiving the Lord himself, their so wonderful faith was not of\r\nnature, but was the gift of the divine bounty.\r\n\r\nAnd because we desire and wish our definition of the ancient Fathers,\r\nwritten above, to be a medicine not only for the clergy but also for the\r\nlaity, it has been decided that the illustrious and noble men, who have\r\nassembled with us at the aforesaid festival, shall subscribe it with their\r\nown hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 86. The Roman Church as the Centre of the Catholic Roman Element of the\r\nWest\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the confusion of the fifth century, when the provinces of the Roman\r\nEmpire were being lopped off one by one, Italy invaded, and the larger\r\npolitical institutions disappearing, the Church was the one institution\r\nthat maintained itself. In not a few places among the barbarians the\r\nbishops became the acknowledged heads of the Roman element of the\r\ncommunities. In meeting the threatened invasion of Italy by Attila, Leo\r\nwas the representative of the Roman people, the head of the embassy sent\r\nto induce the Hun to recross the Danube. Under such circumstances the see\r\nof Rome constantly gained in importance politically and ecclesiastically.\r\nAs a centre of unity it was far more powerful than a feeble emperor at\r\nRavenna or puppets set up by barbarians. It was the one and only great\r\nlink between the provinces and the representative of the ancient order. It\r\nrepresented Rome, an efficient and generally gratefully recognized\r\nauthority. In the development of the papal idea the first stadium was\r\ncompleted with the pontificate of Leo the Great (440-461), who, fully\r\nconscious of the inherited Petrine prerogatives, expressed them the most\r\nclearly, persistently, and, on the whole, most successfully of any pontiff\r\nbefore Gregory the Great. Leo, therefore, stands at the end of a\r\ndevelopment marked by the utterances of Victor, Cornelius, Siricius,\r\nInnocent I, Zosimus, Boniface I, and Celestine. For their statements of\r\nthe authority of the Roman see, see Denziger, under their names, also\r\nKirch and Mirbt. The whole may be found combined in one statement in\r\nSchwanne, _Dogmengeschichte_, I, 413 _f._; II, 661-698.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: In English there is comparatively\r\n    little except the writings of Leo, see especially _Sermones_ 2,\r\n    82, 84; _Epistulæ_ 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 105, 167; Jerome,\r\n    _Ep._ 146, _ad Evangelum_. Kirch, Mirbt, and Denziger give many\r\n    references to original texts and citations.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Leo the Great, _Sermo_ 3. (MSL, 55:145 _f._)\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the prerogatives of Peter and his see.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 2. … From His overruling and eternal providence we have received also\r\nthe support of the Apostle’s aid, which assuredly does not cease from its\r\noperation; and the strength of the foundation, on which the whole lofty\r\nbuilding of the Church is reared, is not weakened by the weight of the\r\ntemple that rests upon it. For the solidity of that faith which was\r\npraised in the chief of the Apostles is perpetual; and, as that remains\r\nwhich Peter believed in Christ, so that remains which Christ instituted in\r\nPeter. For when, as has been read in the Gospel lesson [_i.e._, for the\r\nday], the Lord has asked the disciples whom they believed Him to be, amid\r\nthe various opinions that were held, the blessed Peter replied, saying:\r\n“Thou art the Christ,” etc. [Matt. 16:16-19].\r\n\r\nCh. 3. The dispensation of the truth therefore abides, and the blessed\r\nPeter, persevering in the strength of the rock which he has received, has\r\nnot abandoned the helm of the Church which he undertook. For he was\r\nordained before the rest in such a way that since he is called the rock,\r\nsince he is pronounced the foundation, since he is constituted the\r\ndoorkeeper of the kingdom of heaven, since he is set up as the judge to\r\nbind and to loose, whose judgments shall retain their validity in heaven,\r\nfrom all these mystical titles we might know the nature of his association\r\nwith Christ. And still to-day he more fully and effectually performs what\r\nis intrusted to him, and carries out every part of his duty and charge in\r\nHim and with Him, through whom he has been glorified. And so if anything\r\nis rightly done or rightly decreed by us, if anything is obtained from the\r\nmercy of God by daily supplications, it is his work and merits whose power\r\nlives in his see and whose authority excels. For this, dearly beloved,\r\nthat confession gained, that confession which, inspired in the Apostle’s\r\nheart by God the Father, transcends all the uncertainty of human opinions,\r\nand was endued with the firmness of a rock, which no assaults could shake.\r\nFor throughout the Church Peter daily says, “Thou art the Christ, the Son\r\nof the living God,” and every tongue which confesses the Lord is inspired\r\nby the instruction [_magisterio_] of that voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Leo the Great, _Ep._ 104, _ad Marcianum Augustum_, A. D. 452. (MSL,\r\n54:993.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Condemnation of the twenty-eighth canon of Chalcedon.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This and the two following epistles upon the twenty-eighth canon\r\n    of the Council of Chalcedon define the relation of the Roman see\r\n    to councils, canons, and patriarchal sees. Apostolic sees may not\r\n    be constituted by mere canon; political importance of a place does\r\n    not regulate its ecclesiastical position; the see of Rome can\r\n    reject the canons of councils even though general; apostolic sees\r\n    connected with Peter may not have their authority diminished. For\r\n    the twenty-eighth canon of Chalcedon, _v. infra_, § 90, _d_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 3. Let the city of Constantinople have, as we desire, its glory, and\r\nmay it, under the protection of God’s right hand, long enjoy the rule of\r\nyour clemency. Yet the basis of things secular is one, and the basis of\r\nthings divine another; and there can be no sure building save on that rock\r\nwhich the Lord laid as a foundation. He that covets what is not his due,\r\nloses what is his own. Let it be enough for the aforesaid [Anatolius,\r\nbishop of Constantinople] that by the aid of your piety and by my\r\nfavorable assent he has obtained the bishopric of so great a city. Let him\r\nnot disdain a royal city, which he cannot make an apostolic see; and let\r\nhim on no account hope to be able to rise by injury to others. For the\r\nprivileges of the churches, determined by the canons of the holy Fathers,\r\nand fixed by the decrees of the Nicene synod, cannot be overthrown by an\r\nunscrupulous act, nor disturbed by an innovation. And in the faithful\r\nexecution of this task by the aid of Christ, it is necessary that I show\r\nan unflinching devotion; for it is a charge intrusted to me, and it tends\r\nto condemnation if the rules sanctioned by the Fathers and laid down under\r\nthe guidance of God’s spirit at the synod of Nicæa for the government of\r\nthe whole Church are violated with my connivance (which God forbid) and if\r\nthe wishes of a single brother have more weight with me than the common\r\nword of the Lord’s whole house.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Leo the Great, _Ep._ 105, _ad Pulcheriam Augustam_ A. D. 452. (MSL,\r\n54:997.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Condemnation of all canons contravening those of Nicæa.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. Let him [Anatolius] know to what sort of man he has succeeded, and,\r\nexpelling all the spirit of pride, let him imitate the faith of Flavian,\r\nhis modesty and his humility, which raised him up even to a confessor’s\r\nglory. If he will shine with his virtues, he will be praiseworthy and\r\neverywhere he will win an abundance of love, not by seeking human things,\r\nbut divine favor. And by this careful course I promise that my heart will\r\nalso be bound to him, and the love of this apostolic see which we have\r\never bestowed upon the church of Constantinople shall never be violated by\r\nany change. Because, if rulers, lacking self-restraint, fall into errors,\r\nyet the purity of the churches of Christ continues. As for the assents of\r\nbishops which are in contradiction with the regulations of the holy canons\r\ncomposed at Nicæa, in conjunction with your faithful race we do not\r\nrecognize them, and by the authority of the blessed Apostle Peter we\r\nabsolutely disannul in comprehensive terms in all cases ecclesiastical,\r\nfollowing those laws which the Holy Ghost set forth by three hundred and\r\neighteen bishops for the pacific observance of all priests, so that, even\r\nif a much greater number were to pass a different decree from theirs,\r\nwhatever was opposed to their constitution would have to be held in no\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Leo the Great, _Ep._ 106, _ad Anatolium_ A. D. 452.

The see of Alexandria may not\r\nlose any of that dignity which it merited through St. Mark, the evangelist\r\nand disciple of the blessed Peter, nor may the splendor of so great a\r\nchurch be obscured by another’s clouds, when Dioscurus fell through his\r\npersistence in impiety. The church of Antioch, too, in which first, at the\r\npreaching of the blessed Apostle Peter, the Christian name arose, must\r\ncontinue in the position assigned to it by the Fathers, and, being set in\r\nthe third place [Can. 6, Nicæa, 325, _v. supra_, § 72], must never be\r\nlowered therefrom. For the see is one thing, and those who preside in it\r\nsomething different; and an individual’s great honor is his own integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Leo the Great, _Ep._ 6, _ad Anastasium_ A. D. 444.

Inasmuch, dear brother, as your request has been made known to us\r\nthrough our son Nicholas, the priest, that you also, like your\r\npredecessors, might receive from us in your turn authority over Illyricum\r\nfor the observance of the rules, we give our consent, and earnestly exhort\r\nthat no concealment and no negligence may be allowed in the management of\r\nthe churches situated throughout Illyricum, which we commit to you in our\r\nstead, following the precedent of Siricius, of blessed memory, who then,\r\nfor the first time acting on a fixed method, intrusted them to your last\r\npredecessor but one, Anysius, of holy memory, who had at the time well\r\ndeserved of the Apostolic See, and was approved by after events, that he\r\nmight render assistance to the churches situated in that province, whom he\r\nwished to keep up to the discipline.…\r\n\r\nCh. 5.

The Church In The Eastern Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the permanent division of the Empire, the church life\r\nof the East was disturbed by a series of closely connected disputes known\r\nas the First Origenistic Controversy (§ 87), in which were comprised a\r\nconflict between a rationalistic tendency, connected with the religious\r\nphilosophy of Origen, and a traditionalism that eschewed speculation, a\r\nbitter rivalry between the great sees of Alexandria, the religious and\r\nintellectual capital of the East, and Constantinople, the church of the\r\nnew imperial city, and personal disputes. But more serious controversies\r\nwere already beginning. While the Church of the West was laying the\r\nfoundations of the papal system, the Church of the East was falling more\r\nand more under the dominance of the secular authority; while the West was\r\ndeveloping its anthropology, with its doctrines of Original Sin, Grace,\r\nand Election, the East was entering upon the long discussion of the topic\r\nwhich had been left by the Arian controversy—granted that the incarnate\r\nSon of God is truly eternal God, in what way are the divine and human\r\nnatures related to the one personality of the incarnate God (§ 88)? The\r\ncontroversies that arose over this topic involved the entire Church of the\r\nEast, and found in the general councils of Ephesus, A. D. 431 (§ 89), and\r\nChalcedon, A. D. 451 (§ 90), partial solutions. In the case of each\r\ncouncil, permanent schisms resulted, and large portions of the Church of\r\nthe East broke away from the previous unity (§ 91); and on account of the\r\nintimate connection between the affairs of the Church and the secular\r\npolicy of the Empire, a schism was caused between the see of Rome and the\r\nchurches in communion with the see of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 87. The First Origenistic Controversy and the Triumph of Traditionalism\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the East the leading theologians of the fourth century were educated\r\nunder the influence of Origenism; among these were Basil of Cæsarea,\r\nGregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus. In the West the feeling\r\nregarding Origen was not so favorable, but the Western theologians, Jerome\r\nand Rufinus, who were then living in Palestine, shared in the general\r\nadmiration of Origen. But a series of brief controversies broke out in\r\nwhich the standing of Origen as an orthodox theologian was seriously\r\nattacked, as well as the whole tendency for which he stood. The result was\r\na wide-spread condemnation of the spiritualizing teaching of the great\r\nAlexandrian, and the rise of what might be called an anthropomorphic\r\ntraditionalism. The first of the three controversies took place in\r\nPalestine, 395-399, and was occasioned by Epiphanius of Salamis, a zealous\r\nopponent of heresy. He denounced Origen and induced Jerome to abandon\r\nOrigen; and Rufinus was soon in bitter enmity with Jerome. The second\r\ncontroversy took place in Egypt about the same time, when a group of monks\r\nin the Scetic desert, who were violently opposed to Origenism, compelled\r\nTheophilus, bishop of Alexandria and an admirer of Origen, to abandon that\r\ntheologian and to side with them against the monks of the Nitrian desert,\r\nwho were Origenists, and to condemn Origen at a council at Alexandria,\r\n399. The third controversy involved John Chrysostom, bishop of\r\nConstantinople, who had protected four Nitrian monks who had fled to his\r\nprotection. Theophilus seized the opportunity and, with the assistance for\r\na time of Epiphanius, ultimately brought about the downfall of Chrysostom,\r\nwho died deposed and in exile, 404. No controversies of the ancient Church\r\nare less attractive than the Origenistic, in which so much personal\r\nrancor, selfish ambition, mean intrigue, and so little profound thought\r\nwere involved. The literature, therefore, is scanty.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Jerome, _Ep._ 86-99 (PNF); Rufinus and\r\n    Jerome, controversial writings bearing on Origenism in PNF, ser.\r\n    II. vol. III, pp. 417-541; Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, VI, 2-21;\r\n    Sozomen, _Hist. Ec._, VIII, 2-28.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Basil, _De Spiritu Sancto_, 27. (MSG, 32:187.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The force of unwritten tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following is the most important and authoritative statement of\r\n    the force of unwritten tradition in the Eastern Church. It is\r\n    referred to by John of Damascus in his defence of images (_De Fide\r\n    Orthod._, IV, 16), _cf._ § 109. It is placed in the present\r\n    section as illustrating the principle of traditionalism which, in\r\n    a fanatical form, brought about the Origenistic controversies.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the beliefs and public teachings preserved in the Church, some we have\r\nfrom written tradition, others we have received as delivered to us “in a\r\nmystery” by the tradition of the Apostles; and both of these have in\r\nrelation to true piety the same binding force. And these no one will\r\ngainsay, at least no one who is versed even moderately in the institutions\r\nof the Church. For were we to reject such customs as are unwritten as\r\nhaving no great force, we should unintentionally injure the gospels in\r\ntheir very vitals; or, rather, reduce our public definition to a mere name\r\nand nothing more. For example, to take the first and most general\r\ninstance, who is there who has taught us in writing to sign with the cross\r\nthose who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? What writing\r\nhas taught us to turn to the East in our prayers? Which of the saints has\r\nleft us in writing the words at the invocation and at the displaying of\r\nthe bread in the eucharist and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is\r\nwell known, content with what the Apostle or the Gospel has recorded; but,\r\nboth before and after, we say other words as having great importance for\r\nthe mystery, and these we derive from unwritten teaching. Moreover, we\r\nbless the water of baptism and the oil of chrism, and, besides this, him\r\nwho is baptized. From what writings? Is it not from the silent and\r\nmystical tradition? What written word teaches the anointing of oil itself?\r\nAnd whence is it that a man is baptized three times? And as to other\r\ncustoms of baptism, from what Scripture comes the renunciation of Satan\r\nand his angels? Does not this come from the unpublished and secret\r\nteaching which our fathers guarded in silence, averse from curious\r\nmeddling and inquisitive investigation, having learned the lesson that the\r\nreverence of the mysteries is best preserved in silence? How was it proper\r\nto parade in public the teaching of those things which it was not\r\npermitted the uninitiated to look at?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Jerome, _Preface to the Vulgate Translation of the New Testament_.\r\n(MSL, 29:557.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Jerome’s free critical attitude in his work in his earlier life.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This preface is addressed to Bishop Damasus of Rome and is dated\r\n    383.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou urge me to make a new work out of an old and, as it were, to sit in\r\njudgment on the copies of the Scriptures already scattered throughout the\r\nwhole world; and, inasmuch as they differ among themselves, I am to decide\r\nwhich of them agree with the Greek original. A pious labor, but a perilous\r\npresumption; to judge others, myself to be judged of all; to change the\r\nlanguage of the aged, and to carry back the world already grown gray, back\r\nto the beginnings of its infancy! Is there a man, learned or unlearned,\r\nwho will not, when he takes the volume into his hands and perceives that\r\nwhat he reads differs from the flavor which once he tasted, break out\r\nimmediately into violent language and call me a forger and a profane\r\nperson for having the audacity to add anything to the ancient books or to\r\nchange or correct anything? I am consoled in two ways in bearing this\r\nodium: in the first place, that you, the supreme bishop, command it to be\r\ndone; and secondly, even on the testimony of those reviling us, what\r\nvaries cannot be true. For if we put faith in the Latin texts, let them\r\ntell us which; for there are almost as many texts as copies. But if the\r\ntruth is to be sought from many, why should we not go back to the original\r\nGreek and correct the mistakes introduced by inaccurate translators, and\r\nthe blundering alterations of confident and ignorant men, and further, all\r\nthat has been added or altered by sleepy copyists? I am not discussing the\r\nOld Testament, which was turned into Greek by the Seventy Elders, and has\r\nreached us by a descent of three steps. I do not ask what Aquila and\r\nSymmachus think, or why Theodotion takes a middle course between the\r\nancients and the moderns. I am willing to let that be a true translation\r\nwhich had apostolic approval [_i.e._, the LXX]. I am now speaking of the\r\nNew Testament. This was undoubtedly composed in Greek, with the exception\r\nof the work of the Apostle Matthew, who first published the gospel of\r\nChrist in Judea and in Hebrew. This [_i.e._, the New Testament], as it is\r\nin our language, is certainly marked by discrepancies, and the stream\r\nflows in different channels; it must be sought in one fountainhead. I pass\r\nover those manuscripts bearing the names of Lucian and Hesychius, which a\r\nfew contentious persons perversely support. It was not permitted these\r\nwriters to amend anything in the Old Testament after the labor of the\r\nSeventy; and it was useless to make corrections in the New, for\r\ntranslations of the Scriptures already made in the language of many\r\nnations show that they are additions and false. Therefore this short\r\npreface promises only the four gospels, of which the order is Matthew,\r\nMark, Luke, and John, revised by a comparison of the Greek manuscripts and\r\nonly of the ancient manuscripts. And that they might not depart far from\r\nthe Latin customarily read, I have used my pen with some restraint, so\r\nthat having corrected only the passages which seemed to change the\r\nmeaning, I have allowed the rest to remain as it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Jerome, _Ep._ 7, _ad Pammachium_. (MSL, 23:376.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The principal errors of Origen according to Jerome.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is the most important work of Jerome in the controversy known\r\n    as the Origenistic controversy. Jerome attacks in this work John,\r\n    bishop of Jerusalem, and writes as a result of the work of\r\n    Epiphanius in Palestine three years before. The following were\r\n    addressed to John to reject, as a test of that bishop’s orthodoxy.\r\n    See above, § 43.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, in the book περὶ ἀρχῶν it is said [I, 1:8]: “For as it is unfitting\r\nto say that the Son can see the Father, so it is not meet to think that\r\nthe Holy Spirit can see the Son.”\r\n\r\nSecondly, that souls are bound in this body as in a prison; and that\r\nbefore man was made in paradise they dwelt among rational creatures in the\r\nheavens. Wherefore, afterward, to console itself, the soul says in the\r\nPsalms, “Before I was humbled I went wrong,” and “Return, my soul, unto\r\nthy rest,” and “Lead my soul out of prison,” and similarly elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that he says that both the devil and the demons will some time or\r\nother repent and ultimately reign with the saints.\r\n\r\nFourthly, that he interprets the coats of skins, with which Adam and Eve\r\nwere clothed after their fall and ejection from paradise, to be human\r\nbodies, and no doubt they were previously in paradise without flesh,\r\nsinews, or bones.\r\n\r\nFifthly, he most openly denies the resurrection of the flesh, the bodily\r\nstructure, and the distinction of sexes by which we men are distinguished\r\nfrom women, both in his explanation of the first psalm and in many other\r\ntreatises.\r\n\r\nSixthly, he so allegorizes paradise as to destroy the truth of history,\r\nunderstanding angels instead of trees, heavenly virtues instead of rivers;\r\nand he overthrows all that is contained in the history of paradise by his\r\ntropological interpretation.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, he thinks that the waters which in the Scriptures are said to\r\nbe above the heavens are holy and supernal powers; while those which are\r\nupon the earth and beneath the earth are, on the contrary, demoniacal\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nEighthly, that the image and likeness of God, in which man was created,\r\nwas lost and was no longer in man after he was expelled from paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Anastasius, _Ep. ad Simplicianum_, in Jerome, _Ep._ 95 (MSL,\r\n22:772.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Condemnation of Origen by Anastasius, bishop of Rome, A. D. 400\r\n\r\n\r\nTo his lord and brother, Simplicianus, Anastasius.\r\n\r\nIt is felt right that a shepherd have great care and watchfulness over his\r\nflock. In like manner, also, the careful watchman from his lofty tower\r\nkeeps a lookout day and night on behalf of the city. In the hour of\r\ntempest and peril the prudent shipmaster suffers great distress of mind\r\nlest by the tempest and the violent waves his vessel be dashed upon the\r\nrocks. With similar feelings that reverend and honorable man Theophilus,\r\nour brother and fellow-bishop, ceases not to watch over the things which\r\nmake for salvation, that God’s people in the different churches may not by\r\nreading Origen run into awful blasphemies.\r\n\r\nHaving been informed, then, by the letter of the aforesaid, we inform your\r\nholiness that just as we are set in the city of Rome, in which the prince\r\nof the Apostles, the glorious Peter, founded the Church and then by his\r\nfaith strengthened it; to the end that no man contrary to the commandment\r\nread these books which we have mentioned and the same we have condemned;\r\nand with earnest prayers we have urged that the precepts of the\r\nEvangelists which God and Christ have inspired the Evangelists to teach\r\nought not to be forsaken; but that is to be remembered which the venerable\r\nApostle Paul preached by way of warning: “If any one preach a gospel unto\r\nyou other than that which was preached unto you, let him be anathema”\r\n[Gal. 1:8]. Holding fast, therefore, this precept, we have intimated that\r\neverything written in days past by Origen that is contrary to our faith is\r\neven by us rejected and condemned.\r\n\r\nWe have written these things to your holiness by the hand of the presbyter\r\nEusebius, who, being a man filled with a glowing faith and having the love\r\nof the Lord, has shown me some blasphemous chapters at which we shuddered\r\nand which we condemned, but if any other things have been put forth by\r\nOrigen, you should know that with their author they are alike condemned by\r\nme. The Lord have you in safe-keeping, my lord and brother deservedly held\r\nin honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Rufinus, _Preface to Translation of Origen’s __“__De Principiis__”_.\r\n(MSL, 22:733 and also MSG, 11:111.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In this preface Rufinus refers, without mentioning names, to\r\n    Jerome. Inasmuch as it was perfectly clear to whom the allusion\r\n    was made, as the translator and admirer of Origen, Jerome felt\r\n    himself personally attacked and retorted furiously upon Rufinus.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that a great many of the brethren, incited by their desire for a\r\nknowledge of the Scriptures, have requested various men versed in Greek\r\nletters to make Origen a Roman and give him to Latin ears. Among these was\r\nour brother and associate [_i.e._, Jerome], who was so requested by Bishop\r\nDamasus, when he translated the two homilies on the Song of Songs from\r\nGreek into Latin, prefixed to the work a preface so full of beauty and so\r\nmagnificent that he awoke in every one the desire of reading Origen and of\r\neagerly examining his works, and he said that to the soul of that man the\r\nwords might well be applied, “The King has brought me into his chamber”\r\n[Cant. 2:4], and he declared that Origen in his other books surpassed all\r\nother men, but in this had surpassed himself. What he promised in his\r\npreface is, indeed, that he would give to Roman ears not only these books\r\non the Song of Songs, but many others of Origen. But, as I perceive, he is\r\nso pleased with his own style that he pursues an object bringing him more\r\nglory, viz., to be the father of a book rather than a translator. I am\r\ntherefore following out a task begun by him and commended by him.… In\r\ntranslation, I follow as far as possible the method of my predecessors,\r\nand especially of him whom I have already mentioned, who, after he had\r\ntranslated into Latin above seventy of the books of Origen, which he\r\ncalled Homilies, and also a certain number of the tomes written on the\r\nApostle [the Epistles of St. Paul], since a number of offensive passages\r\nare to be found in the Greek, eliminated and purged, in his translation,\r\nall of them, so that the Latin reader will find nothing in these which jar\r\non our faith. Him, therefore, we follow, not indeed with the power of his\r\neloquence, but as far as we can in his rules and methods: that is, taking\r\ncare not to promulgate those things which in the books of Origen are found\r\nto be discrepant and contradictory one to the other. The cause of these\r\nvariations I have set forth fully in the apology which Pamphilus wrote for\r\nthe books of Origen, to which is appended a short treatise showing how\r\nproofs which, as I judge, are quite clear in his books have in many cases\r\nbeen falsified by heretical and evil-disposed persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Augustine, _Ep._ 73, Ch. 8. (MSL, 33:249.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The attempt of Augustine to bring about a reconciliation between\r\n    Rufinus and Jerome. Jerome had written some affectionate words to\r\n    Augustine to which he alludes in the beginning of the following\r\n    passage:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, by these words, now not only yours but also mine, I am gladdened and\r\nrefreshed, and when I am comforted not a little by the desire of both of\r\nus for mutual fellowship, which has been suspended and is not satisfied,\r\nsuddenly I am pierced through by the darts of keenest sorrow when I\r\nconsider that between you [_i.e._, Rufinus and Jerome] (to whom God\r\ngranted in fullest measure and for a long time that which both of us have\r\nlonged for, that in closest and most intimate fellowship you tasted\r\ntogether the honey of Holy Scriptures) such a blight of bitterness has\r\nbroken out, when, where, and in whom it was not to be feared, since it has\r\nbefallen you at the very time when, unencumbered, having cast away secular\r\nburdens, you were following the Lord, were living together in that land in\r\nwhich the Lord walked with human feet, when He said, “Peace I leave with\r\nyou, My peace I give unto you”; being, moreover, men of mature age, whose\r\nlife was devoted to the study of the word of God. Truly, “man’s life on\r\nearth is a period of trial” [Job 7:1]. Alas, that I cannot meet you both\r\ntogether, perchance that in agitation, grief, and fear I might cast myself\r\nat your feet, weep till I could weep no more, and appeal as I love you,\r\nfirst to each of you for his own sake, and then for the sake of those,\r\nespecially the weak, “for whom Christ died” [I Cor. 8:11], who to their\r\ngreat peril look on you as on the stage of time, imploring you not to\r\nscatter abroad, in writing, those things about each other which when\r\nreconciled, you, who are now unwilling to be reconciled, could not then\r\ndestroy, and which when reconciled you would not dare to read lest you\r\nshould quarrel anew.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, VI, 15. (MSG, 67:708.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The fall of Chrysostom.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Epiphanius had gone to Constantinople on the suggestion of\r\n    Theophilus, and there, in his zeal, had violated the canons of\r\n    ordination as generally received. In this case he had ordained\r\n    priests in the diocese of Chrysostom and without his permission.\r\n    Other troubles had arisen. On being called to account for his\r\n    conduct by Chrysostom, Epiphanius hastily left the city, and died\r\n    on the voyage back to his diocese, Salamis, in Cyprus.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Epiphanius had gone John was informed by some person that the Empress\r\nEudoxia had set Epiphanius against him. Being of a fiery temperament and\r\nof ready utterance, he soon after pronounced to the public an invective\r\nagainst women in general. The people readily took this as uttered\r\nindirectly against the Empress, and so the speech, laid hold of by\r\nevil-disposed persons, was brought to the knowledge of those in authority.\r\nAt length the Empress, having been informed of it, immediately complained\r\nto her husband of the insult offered her, saying that the insult offered\r\nher was an insult to him. He therefore gave orders that Theophilus should\r\nspeedily convoke a synod against John; Severianus also co-operated in\r\npromoting this, for he still retained his grudge [_i.e._, against\r\nChrysostom. See DCB, art. “Severianus, bishop of Gabala.”]. No great\r\nlength of time, accordingly, intervened before Theophilus arrived, having\r\nstirred up many bishops from different cities; but this, also, the summons\r\nof the Emperor had commanded. Especially did they assemble who had one\r\ncause or another of complaint against John, and there were present besides\r\nthose whom John had deposed, for John had deposed many bishops in Asia\r\nwhen he went to Ephesus for the ordination of Heraclides. Accordingly they\r\nall, by previous agreement, assembled at Chalcedon in Bithynia.… Now none\r\nof the clergy [_i.e._, of Constantinople] would go forth to meet\r\nTheophilus or pay him the customary honors because he was openly known as\r\nJohn’s enemy. But the Alexandrian sailors—for it happened that at that\r\ntime the grain-transport ships were there—on meeting him, greeted him with\r\njoyful acclamations. He excused himself from entering the church, and took\r\nup his abode at one of the imperial mansions called “The Placidian.” Then,\r\nin consequence of this, many accusations began to be poured forth against\r\nJohn, and no longer was there any mention of the books of Origen, but all\r\nwere intent on pressing a variety of absurd accusations. When these\r\npreliminary matters were settled the bishops were convened in one of the\r\nsuburbs of Chalcedon, which is called “The Oak,” and immediately cited\r\nJohn to answer charges which were brought against him.… And since John,\r\ntaking exception to those who cited him, on the ground that they were his\r\nenemies, demanded a general council, without delay they repeated their\r\ncitation four times; and as he persisted in his refusal to answer, always\r\ngiving the same reply, they condemned him, and deposed him without giving\r\nany other cause for his deposition than that he refused to obey when\r\nsummoned. This, being announced toward evening, incited the people to a\r\nvery great sedition, insomuch that they kept watch all night and would by\r\nno means suffer him to be removed from the church, but cried out that the\r\ncharges against him ought to be determined by a larger assembly. A decree\r\nof the Emperor, however, commanded that he should be immediately expelled\r\nand sent into exile. When John knew this he voluntarily surrendered\r\nhimself about noon, unknown to the populace, on the third day after his\r\ncondemnation; for he dreaded any insurrectionary movement on his account,\r\nand he was accordingly led away.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Theophilus of Alexandria, _Ep. ad Hieronymum_, in Jerome, _Ep._ 113.\r\n(MSL, 22:932.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Theophilus on the fall of Chrysostom.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the well-beloved and most loving brother Jerome, Theophilus sends\r\ngreeting in the Lord.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the verdict of truth satisfies but few; but the Lord,\r\nspeaking by the prophet, says, “My judgment goeth forth as the light,” and\r\nthey who are surrounded with a horror of darkness do not with clear mind\r\nperceive the nature of things, and they are covered with eternal shame and\r\nknow by their outcome that their efforts have been in vain. Wherefore we\r\nalso have always desired that John [Chrysostom], who for a time ruled the\r\nchurch of Constantinople, might please God, and we have been unwilling to\r\naccept as facts the cause of his ruin in which he behaved himself rashly.\r\nBut not to speak of his other misdeed, he has by taking the Origenists\r\ninto his confidences,(184) by advancing many of them to the priesthood,\r\nand by this crime saddening with no slight grief that man of God,\r\nEpiphanius, of blessed memory, who has shone throughout all the world a\r\nbright star among bishops, deserved to hear the words, “Babylon is fallen,\r\nis fallen.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 88. The Christological Problem and the Theological Tendencies\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arian controversy in bringing about the affirmation of the true deity\r\nof the Son, or Logos, left the Church with the problem of the unity of the\r\ndivine and human natures in the personality of Jesus. It seemed to not a\r\nfew that to combine perfect deity with perfect humanity would result in\r\ntwo personalities. Holding fast, therefore, to the reality of the human\r\nnature, a solution was attempted by Apollinarius, or Apollinaris, by\r\nmaking the divine Logos take the place of the human logos or reason.\r\nMankind consisted of three parts: a body, an animal soul, and a rational\r\nspirit. The Logos was thus united to humanity by substituting the divine\r\nfor the human logos. But this did violence to the integrity of the human\r\nnature of Christ. This attempt on the part of Apollinaris was rejected at\r\nConstantinople, but also by the Church generally. The human natures must\r\nbe complete if human nature was deified by the assumption of man in the\r\nincarnation. On this basis two tendencies showed themselves quite early:\r\nthe human nature might be lost in the divinity, or the human and the\r\ndivine natures might be kept distinct and parallel or in such a way that\r\ncertain acts might be assigned to the divine and certain to the human\r\nnature. The former line of thought, adopted by the Cappadocians, tended\r\ntoward the position assumed by Cyril of Alexandria and in a more extreme\r\nform by the Monophysites. The latter line of thought tended toward what\r\nwas regarded as the position of Nestorius. In this position there was such\r\na sharp cleavage between the divine and the human natures as apparently to\r\ncreate a double personality in the incarnate Son. This divergence of\r\ntheological statement gave rise to the christological controversies which\r\ncontinued in various forms through several centuries in the East, and have\r\nreappeared in various disguises in the course of the Church’s theological\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: There are several exegetical works of\r\n    Cyril of Alexandria available in English, see Bardenhewer, § 77,\r\n    also a German translation of three treatises bearing on\r\n    christology in the Kempten _Bibliothek der Kirchenväter_, 1879.\r\n    For the general point of view of the Cappadocians and the relation\r\n    of the incarnation to redemption, see Gregory of Nyssa, _The Great\r\n    Catechism_ (PNF, ser. II, vol. V), _v. infra_, § 89 and references\r\n    in Seeberg, § 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Apollinaris, _Fragments_. Ed. H. Lietzmann.\r\n\r\n\r\n    His Christology.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following fragments of the teaching of Apollinaris are from H.\r\n    Lietzmann, _Apollinaris von Laodicea und seine Schule. Texte und\r\n    Untersuchungen_, 1904. Many fragments are to be found in the\r\n    _Dialogues_ which Theodoret wrote against Eutychianism, which he\r\n    traced to the teaching of Apollinaris. The first condemnation of\r\n    Apollinaris was at Rome, 377, see Hefele, § 91; Theodoret, _Hist.\r\n    Ec._, V, 10, gives the letter of Damasus issued in the name of the\r\n    synod.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. 224 [81]. If God had been joined with a man, one complete being with\r\nanother complete being, there would be two sons of God, one Son of God by\r\nnature, another through adoption.\r\n\r\nP. 247 [150]. They who assume a twofold spirit in Christ pull a stone out\r\nwith their finger. For if each is independent and impelled by its own\r\nnatural will, it is impossible that in one and the same subject the two\r\ncan be together, who will what is opposed to each other; for each works\r\nwhat is willed by it according to its own proper and personal motives.\r\n\r\nP. 248 [152]. They who speak of one Christ, and assert that there are two\r\nindependent spiritual natures in Him, do not know Him as the Logos made\r\nflesh, who has remained in His natural unity, for they represent Him as\r\ndivided into two unlike natures and modes of operation.\r\n\r\nP. 239 [129]. If a man has soul and body, and both remain distinguished in\r\nunity, how much more has Christ, who joins His divine being with a body,\r\nboth as a permanent possession without any commingling one with the other?\r\n\r\nP. 209 [21, 22]. The Logos became flesh, but the flesh was not without a\r\nsoul, for it is said that it strives against the spirit and opposes the\r\nlaw of the understanding. [In this Apollinaris takes up the trichotomy of\r\nhuman nature, a view which he did not apparently hold at the beginning of\r\nhis teaching.]\r\n\r\nP. 240 [137]. John [John 2:19] spoke of the destroyed temple, that is, of\r\nthe body of Him who would raise it up again. The body is altogether one\r\nwith Him. But if the body of the Lord has become one with the Lord, then\r\nthe characteristics of the body are proved to be characteristics of Him on\r\naccount of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Apollinaris, _Letter to the Emperor Jovian_. Lietzmann, 250 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe confess the Son of God who was begotten eternally before all times, but\r\nin the last times was for our salvation born of Mary according to the\r\nflesh; … and we confess that the same is the Son of God and God according\r\nto the spirit, Son of man according to the flesh; we do not speak of two\r\nnatures in the one Son, of which one is to be worshipped and one is not to\r\nbe worshipped, but of only one nature of the Logos of God, which has\r\nbecome flesh and with His flesh is worshipped with one worship; and we\r\nconfess not two sons, one who is truly God’s Son to be worshipped and\r\nanother the man—who is of Mary and is not to be worshipped, who by the\r\npower of grace had become the Son of God, as is also the case with men,\r\nbut one Son of God who at the same time was born of Mary according to the\r\nflesh in the last days, as the angel answered the Theotokos Mary who\r\nasked, “How shall this be?”—“The Holy Ghost will come upon thee.” He,\r\naccordingly, who was born of the Virgin Mary was Son of God by nature and\r\ntruly God … only according to the flesh from Mary was He man, but at the\r\nsame time, according to the spirit, Son of God; and God has in His own\r\nflesh suffered our sorrows.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Gregory of Nazianzus, _Ep. I ad Cledonium_. (MSG, 37:181.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In this epistle Gregory attacks Apollinaris, basing his argument\r\n    on the notion of salvation by incarnation, which formed the\r\n    foundation of the most characteristic piety of the East, had been\r\n    used as a major premise by Athanasius in opposition to Arianism,\r\n    and runs back to Irenæus and the Asia Minor school; see above, §\r\n    33.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one trusted in a man without a human mind, he is himself really\r\nbereft of mind and quite unworthy of salvation. For what has not been\r\nassumed has not been healed; but what has been united to God is saved. If\r\nonly half of Adam fell, then that which is assumed and saved may be half\r\nalso; but if the whole, it must be united to the whole of Him that was\r\nbegotten and be saved as a whole. Let them not, then, begrudge us our\r\ncomplete salvation, or clothe the Saviour only with bones and nerves and\r\nthe semblance of humanity. For if His manhood is without soul [ἄψυχος],\r\neven the Arians admit this, that they may attribute His passion to the\r\ngodhead, as that which gives motion to the body is also that which\r\nsuffers. But if He had a soul and yet is without a mind, how is He a man,\r\nfor man is not a mindless [ἄνουν] animal? And this would necessarily\r\ninvolve that His form was human, and also His tabernacle, but His soul was\r\nthat of a horse, or an ox, or some other creature without mind. This,\r\nthen, would be what is saved, and I have been deceived in the Truth, and\r\nhave been boasting an honor when it was another who was honored. But if\r\nHis manhood is intellectual and not without mind, let them cease to be\r\nthus really mindless.\r\n\r\nBut, says some one, the godhead was sufficient in place of the human\r\nintellect. What, then, is this to me? For godhead with flesh alone is not\r\nman, nor with soul alone, nor with both apart from mind, which is the most\r\nessential part of man. Keep, then, the whole man, and mingle godhead\r\ntherewith, that you may benefit me in my completeness. But, as he asserts\r\n[_i.e._, Apollinaris], He could not contain two perfect natures. Not if\r\nyou only regard Him in a bodily fashion. For a bushel measure will not\r\nhold two bushels, nor will the space of one body hold two or more bodies.\r\nBut if you will look at what is mental and incorporeal, remember that I\r\nmyself can contain soul and reason and mind and the Holy Spirit; and\r\nbefore me this world, by which I mean the system of things visible and\r\ninvisible, contained Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. For such is the nature\r\nof intellectual existences that they can mingle with one another and with\r\nbodies, incorporeally and invisibly.…\r\n\r\nFurther, let us see what is their account of the assumption of the\r\nmanhood, or the assumption of the flesh, as they call it. If it was in\r\norder that God, otherwise incomprehensible, might be comprehended, and\r\nmight converse with men through His flesh as through a veil, their mask is\r\na pretty one, a hypocritical fable; for it was open to Him to converse\r\nwith us in many other ways, as in the burning bush [Ex. 3:2] and in the\r\nappearance of a man [Gen. 18:5]. But if it was that He might destroy the\r\ncondemnation of sin by sanctifying like by like, then as He needed flesh\r\nfor the sake of the condemned flesh and soul for the sake of the soul, so\r\nalso He needed mind for the sake of mind, which not only fell in Adam but\r\nwas first to be affected, as physicians say, of the illness. For that\r\nwhich received the commandment was that which failed to observe the\r\ncommandment, and that which failed to observe the commandment was that\r\nalso which dared to transgress, and that which transgressed was that which\r\nstood most in need of salvation, and that which needed salvation was that\r\nwhich also was assumed. Therefore mind was taken upon Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Council of Constantinople, A. D. 382, _Epistula Synodica_. Hefele, §\r\n98.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Condemnation of Apollinarianism.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At the Council of Constantinople held the year after that which is\r\n    known as the Second General Council, and attended by nearly the\r\n    same bishops, there was an express condemnation of Apollinaris and\r\n    his doctrine, for though Apollinaris had been condemned in 381,\r\n    the point of doctrine was not stated. The synodical letter of the\r\n    council of 382 is preserved only in part in Theodoret, _Hist.\r\n    Ec._, V, 9, who concludes his account with these words:\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly they openly condemn the innovation of Apollinarius [so Theodoret\r\nwrites the name] in the phrase, “And we preserve the doctrine of the\r\nincarnation of the Lord, holding the tradition that the dispensation of\r\nthe flesh is neither soulless, nor mindless, nor imperfect.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Theodore of Mopsuestia, _Creed_. Hahn, § 215.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The position of the Nestorians.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following extracts are from the creed which was presented at\r\n    the Council of Ephesus, 431, and was written by Theodore of\r\n    Mopsuestia, the greatest theologian of the party which stood with\r\n    Nestorius. Although it does not state the whole doctrine of\r\n    Theodore, yet its historical position is so important that its\r\n    characteristic passages belong in the present connection.\r\n    Bibliographical and critical notes in Hahn, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the dispensation which the Lord God accomplished for our\r\nsalvation in the dispensation according to the Lord Christ, it is\r\nnecessary for us to know that the Lord God the Logos assumed a complete\r\nman, who was of the seed of Abraham and David, according to the statement\r\nof the divine Scriptures, and was according to nature whatsoever they were\r\nof whose seed He was, a perfect man according to nature, consisting of\r\nreasonable soul and human flesh, and the man who was as to nature as we\r\nare, formed by the power of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin,\r\nborn of a woman, born under the law, that he might redeem us all from the\r\nbondage of the law [Gal. 4:4] who receive the adoption of sonship which\r\nwas long before ordained, that man He joined to himself in an ineffable\r\nmanner.…\r\n\r\nAnd we do not say that there are two Sons or two Lords, because there is\r\none God [Son?] according to substance, God the Word, the only begotten Son\r\nof the Father, and He who has been joined with Him is a participator in\r\nHis deity and shares in the name and honor of the Son; and the Lord\r\naccording to essence is God the Word, with whom that which is joined\r\nshares in honor. And therefore we say neither two Sons nor two Lords,\r\nbecause one is He who has an inseparable conjunction with Himself of Him\r\nwho according to essence is Lord and Son, who, having been assumed for our\r\nsalvation, is with Him received as well in the name as in the honor of\r\nboth Son and Lord, not as each one of us individually is a son of God\r\n(wherefore also we are called many sons of God, according to the blessed\r\nPaul), but He alone in an unique manner having this, namely, in that He\r\nwas joined to God the Word, participating in the Sonship and dignity,\r\ntakes away every thought of two Sons or two Lords, and offers indeed to us\r\nin conjunction with the God the Word, to have all faith in Him and all\r\nunderstanding and contemplation, on account of which things also He\r\nreceives from every creature the worship and sacrifice of God. Therefore\r\nwe say that there is one Lord, namely, the Lord Jesus Christ, by whom all\r\nthings were made, understanding principally God the Word, who according to\r\nsubstance is Son of God and Lord, equally regarding that which was\r\nassumed, Jesus of Nazareth, who God anointed with the Spirit and power, as\r\nin conjunction with God the Lord, and participating in sonship and\r\ndignity, who also is called the second Adam, according to the blessed\r\nApostle Paul, as being of the same nature as Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Theodore of Mopsuestia, _Fragments_. Swete, _Theodori epis. Mops. in\r\nepistulas b. Pauli commentarii_, Cambridge, 1880, 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the appendix to the second volume of this work by Theodore\r\n    there are many fragments of Theodore’s principal dogmatic work,\r\n    _On the Incarnation_, directed against Eunomius. The work as a\r\n    whole has not been preserved. In the same appendix there are also\r\n    other important fragments. The references are to this edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. 299. If we distinguish the two natures, we speak of one complete nature\r\nof God the Word and a complete person (πρόσωπον). But we name complete\r\nalso the nature of the man and also the person. If we think on the\r\nconjunction (συνάφεια) then we speak of one person.\r\n\r\nP. 312. In the moment in which He [Jesus] was formed [in the womb of the\r\nVirgin] He received the destination of being a temple of God. For we\r\nshould not believe that God was born of the Virgin unless we are willing\r\nto assume that one and the same is that which is born and what is in that\r\nwhich is born, the temple, and God the Logos in the temple.… If God had\r\nbecome flesh, how could He who was born be named God from God [_cf._\r\nNicene Creed], and of one being with the Father? for the flesh does not\r\nadmit of such a designation.\r\n\r\nP. 314. The Logos was always in Jesus, also by His birth and when He was\r\nin the womb, at the first moment of his beginning; to His development He\r\ngave the rule and measure, and led Him from step to step to perfection.\r\n\r\nP. 310. If it is asked, did Mary bear a man, or is she the bearer of God\r\n[Theotokos], we can say that both statements are true. One is true\r\naccording to the nature of the case; the other only relatively. She bore a\r\nman according to nature, for He was a man who was in the womb of Mary.…\r\nShe is Theotokos, since God was in the man who was born; not enclosed in\r\nHim according to nature, but was in Him according to the relation of His\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Nestorius, _Fragments_. Loofs, _Nestoriana_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The fragments of Nestorius have been collected by Loofs,\r\n    _Nestoriana_, Halle, 1905; to this work the references are made.\r\n    It now appears that what was condemned as Nestorianism was a\r\n    perversion of his teaching and that Nestorius was himself in\r\n    harmony with the definition which was put forth at Chalcedon, a\r\n    council which he survived and regarded as a vindication of his\r\n    position after the wrong done him at Ephesus by Cyril; _cf._\r\n    Bethune-Baker, _Nestorius and His Teaching_, Cambridge, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. 252. Is Paul a liar when he speaks of the godhead of Christ and says:\r\n“Without father, without mother, without genealogy”? My good friend, Mary\r\nhas not born the godhead, for that which is born of the flesh is flesh.… A\r\ncreature has not born the Creator, but she bore a man, the organ of\r\ndivinity; the Holy Ghost did not create God the Word, but with that which\r\nwas born of the Virgin He prepared for God the Word, a temple, in which He\r\nshould dwell.\r\n\r\nP. 177. Whenever the Holy Scriptures make mention of the works of\r\nsalvation prepared by the Lord, they speak of the birth and suffering, not\r\nof the divinity but of the humanity of Christ; therefore, according to a\r\nmore exact expression the holy Virgin is named the bearer of Christ\r\n[Christotokos].\r\n\r\nP. 167. If any one will bring forward the designation, “Theotokos,”\r\nbecause the humanity that was born was conjoined with the Word, not\r\nbecause of her who bore, so we say that, although the name is not\r\nappropriate to her who bore, for the actual mother must be of the same\r\nsubstance as her child, yet it can be endured in consideration of the fact\r\nthat the temple, which is inseparably united with God the Word, comes of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nP. 196. Each nature must retain its peculiar attributes, and so we must,\r\nin regard to the union, wonderful and exalted far above all understanding,\r\nthink of one honor and confess one Son.… With the one name Christ we\r\ndesignate at the same time two natures.… The essential characteristics in\r\nthe nature of the divinity and in the humanity are from all eternity\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nP. 275. God the Word is also named Christ because He has always\r\nconjunction with Christ. And it is impossible for God the Word to do\r\nanything without the humanity, for all is planned upon an intimate\r\nconjunction, not on the deification of the humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Gregory of Nyssa, _Contra Eunomium_, V, 5. (MSG, 45:705.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Christology of the Cappadocians.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Cappadocians use language which was afterward condemned when\r\n    given its extreme Alexandrian interpretation. Hefele, § 127, may\r\n    be consulted with profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flesh is not identical with the godhead before this is transformed\r\ninto the godhead, so that necessarily some things are appropriate to God\r\nthe Word, other things to the form of a servant. If, then, he [Eunomius]\r\ndoes not reproach himself with a duality of Words, on account of such\r\nconfusion, why are we slanderously charged with dividing the faith into\r\ntwo Christs, we who say that He who was highly exalted after His passion,\r\nwas made Lord and Christ by His union with Him who is verily Lord and\r\nChrist, knowing by what we have learned that the divine nature is always\r\none and the same mode of existence, while the flesh in itself is that\r\nwhich reason and sense apprehend concerning it, but when mixed with the\r\ndivine it no longer remains in its own limitations and properties, but is\r\ntaken up to that which is overwhelming and transcendent. Our\r\ncontemplation, however, of the respective properties of the flesh and of\r\nthe godhead remains free from confusion, so long as each of these is\r\nconsidered in itself, as, for example, “The Word was before the ages, but\r\nflesh came into being in the last times.”… It is not the human nature that\r\nraises up Lazarus, nor is it the power that cannot suffer that weeps for\r\nhim when he lies in the grave; the tear proceeds from the man, the life\r\nfrom the true Life.… So much as this is clear … that the blows belong to\r\nthe servant in whom the Lord was, the honors to the Lord, whom the servant\r\ncompassed about, so that by reason of contact and the union of natures the\r\nproper attributes of each belong to both, as the Lord receives the stripes\r\nof the servant, while the servant is glorified with the honor of the Lord.\r\n\r\nThe godhead “empties” itself that it may come within the capacity of the\r\nhuman nature, and the human nature is renewed by becoming divine through\r\nits commixture with the divine.… As fire that lies in wood, hidden often\r\nbelow the surface, and is unobserved by the senses of those who see or\r\neven touch it, is manifest, however, when it blazes up, so too, at His\r\ndeath (which He brought about at His will, who separated His soul from His\r\nbody, who said to His own Father “Into Thy hands I commend My spirit”\r\n[Luke 23:46], “who,” as He says, “had power to lay it down and had power\r\nto take it again”), He who, because He is the Lord of glory, despised that\r\nwhich is shame among men, having concealed, as it were, the flame of His\r\nlife in His bodily nature, by the dispensation of His death, kindled and\r\ninflamed it once more by the power of His own godhead, warming into life\r\nthat which had been made dead, having infused with the infinity of His\r\ndivine power those humble first-fruits of our nature; made it also to be\r\nthat which He himself was, the servile form to be the Lord, and the man\r\nborn of Mary to be Christ, and Him, who was crucified through weakness, to\r\nbe life and power, and making all such things as are piously conceived to\r\nbe in God the Word to be also in that which the Word assumed; so that\r\nthese attributes no longer seem to be in either nature, being, by\r\ncommixture with the divine, made anew in conformity with the nature that\r\noverwhelms it; participates in the power of the godhead, as if one were to\r\nsay that a mixture makes a drop of vinegar mingled in the deep to be sea,\r\nfor the reason that the natural quality of this liquid does not continue\r\nin the infinity of that which overwhelms it.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 89. The Nestorian Controversy; the Council of Ephesus A. D. 431.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ephesus was called to settle the dispute which had arisen\r\nbetween Cyril and the Alexandrians and Nestorius, archbishop of\r\nConstantinople, and the Antiochians. Several councils had been held\r\npreviously, and much acrimonious debate. Both parties desired a council to\r\nadjust the dispute. The Emperor Theodosius II, in an edict of November 19,\r\n430, called a council to be held on the following Whitsunday at Ephesus.\r\nThe council was opened by Cyril and Memnon, bishop of Ephesus, June 22, a\r\nfew days after the date assigned. This opening of the synod was opposed by\r\nthe imperial commissioner and the party of Nestorius, because many of the\r\nAntiochians had not yet arrived. Cyril and Memnon, who had undertaken to\r\nbring about the condemnation and deposition of Nestorius, forced through\r\ntheir programme. On June 26 or 27 the Antiochians arrived, and, under the\r\npresidency of John of Antioch, and with the approval of the imperial\r\ncommissioner, they held a council attended by about fifty bishops, while\r\ntwo hundred attended the rival council under Cyril. This smaller council\r\ndeposed Cyril and Memnon. Both synods appealed to the Emperor and were\r\nconfirmed by him. But shortly after Cyril and Memnon were restored. The\r\nAntiochians now violently attacked the successful Alexandrians but, having\r\nabandoned Nestorius, patched up a union with the Alexandrians, by which\r\nCyril subscribed in 433 to a creed drawn up by the Antiochians, probably\r\nby Theodoret of Cyrus. Accordingly, the council of Cyril was now\r\nrecognized by the Antiochians, as well as by the imperial authority, and\r\nbecame known as the Council of Ephesus, A. D. 431.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Socrates, _Hist. Ec._, VII, 29-34;\r\n    Theodoret, _Epistulæ_ in PNF, ser. II, vol.

Hahn, § 219.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Condemnation of the position of Nestorius.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cyril held a council at Alexandria in 430, in which he set forth\r\n    the teaching of Nestorius, as he understood it, in the form of\r\n    anathemas against any who held the opinions which he set forth in\r\n    order. Nestorius immediately replied by corresponding\r\n    anathematisms. They may be found translated PNF, ser. II, vol.\r\n    XIV, p. 206, where they are placed alongside of Cyril’s. In the\r\n    meantime, Celestine of Rome had called upon Nestorius to retract,\r\n    though as a matter of fact the Nestorian or Antiochian position\r\n    was more in harmony with the position held in Rome, _e.g._,\r\n    compare Anath. IV with the language of Nestorius and Leo, see\r\n    _Tome_ of Leo in § 90. A Greek text of these Anathematisms of\r\n    Cyril may be found also in Denziger, n. 113, as they were\r\n    described in the Fifth General Council as part of the acts of the\r\n    Council of Ephesus A. D. 431; the Latin version (the Greek is\r\n    lost) of the Anathematisms of Nestorius, as given by Marius\r\n    Mercator are in Kirch, nn. 724-736.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. If any one shall not confess that the Emmanuel is in truth God, and\r\nthat therefore the holy Virgin is Theotokos, inasmuch as according to the\r\nflesh she bore the Word of God made flesh; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nII. If any one shall not confess that the Word of God the Father is united\r\naccording to hypostasis to flesh, and that with the flesh of His own He is\r\none Christ, the same manifestly God and man at the same time; let him be\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\nIII. If any one after the union divide the hypostases in the one Christ,\r\njoining them by a connection only, which is according to worthiness, or\r\neven authority and power, and not rather by a coming together, which is\r\nmade by a union according to nature; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nIV. If any one divide between the two persons or hypostases the\r\nexpressions in the evangelical and apostolic writings, or which have been\r\nsaid concerning Christ by the saints, or by Himself concerning Himself,\r\nand shall apply some to Him as to a man regarded separately apart from the\r\nWord of God, and shall apply others, as appropriate to God only, to the\r\nWord of God the Father; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nV. If any one dare to say that the Christ is a god-bearing man, and not\r\nrather that He is in truth God, as an only Son by nature, because “The\r\nWord was made flesh,” and hath share in flesh and blood as we have; let\r\nhim be anathema.\r\n\r\nVI. If any one shall dare to say that the Word of God the Father is the\r\nGod of Christ or the Lord of Christ, and shall not rather confess Him as\r\nat the same time both God and man, since according to the Scriptures the\r\nWord became flesh; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nVII. If any one say that Jesus is, as a man, energized by the Word of God,\r\nand that the glory of the Only begotten is attributed to Him as being\r\nsomething else than His own; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nVIII. If any one say that the man assumed ought to be worshipped together\r\nwith God the Word, and glorified together with Him, and recognized\r\ntogether with Him as God, as one being with another (for this phrase\r\n“together with” is added to convey this meaning) and shall not rather with\r\none adoration worship the Emmanuel and pay Him one glorification, because\r\n“the Word was made flesh”; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nIX. If any man shall say that the one Lord Jesus Christ was glorified by\r\nthe Spirit, so that He used through Him a power not His own, and from Him\r\nreceived power against unclean spirits, and power to perform divine signs\r\nbefore men, and shall not rather confess that it was His own spirit,\r\nthrough which He worked these divine signs; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nX. The divine Scriptures say that Christ was made the high priest and\r\napostle of our confession [Heb. 3:1], and that for our sakes He offered\r\nHimself as a sweet odor to God the Father. If then any one say that it is\r\nnot the divine Word himself, when He was made flesh and had become man as\r\nwe are, but another than He, a man born of a woman, yet different from Him\r\nwho has become our high priest and apostle; or if any one say that He\r\noffered Himself as an offering for Himself, and not rather for us,\r\nwhereas, being without sin, He had no need of offering; let him be\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\nXI. If any one shall not confess that the flesh of the Lord is\r\nlife-giving, and belongs to the Word of God the Father as His very own,\r\nbut shall pretend that it belongs to another who is united to Him\r\naccording to worthiness, and who has served as only a dwelling for the\r\nDivinity; and shall not rather confess that that flesh is life-giving, as\r\nwe say, because it has been made the possession of the Word who is able to\r\ngive life to all; let him be anathema.\r\n\r\nXII. If any one shall not confess that the Word of God suffered in the\r\nflesh, and that He was crucified in the flesh, and that likewise He tasted\r\ndeath in the flesh, and that He is become the first-born from the dead\r\n[Col. 1:18], for as God He is the life and life-giving; let him be\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Council of Ephesus, A. D. 431. _Condemnation of Nestorius_. Mansi,\r\nIV, 1211.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The text may also be found in Hefele, § 134, under the First\r\n    Session of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe holy synod says: Since in addition to other things the impious\r\nNestorius has not obeyed our Citation and did not receive the most holy\r\nand God-fearing bishops who were sent to him by us, we were compelled to\r\nproceed to the examination of his impieties. And, discovering from his\r\nletters and treatises and from the discourses recently delivered by him in\r\nthis metropolis, which have been testified to, that he has held and\r\npublished impious doctrines, and being compelled thereto by the canons and\r\nby the letter of our most holy father and fellow-servant Celestine, the\r\nRoman bishop, we have come, with many tears, to this sorrowful sentence\r\nagainst him: Our Lord Jesus Christ whom he has blasphemed, decrees through\r\nthe present most holy synod that Nestorius be excluded from the episcopal\r\ndignity and from all priestly communion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Council of Ephesus, A. D. 431, _Ep. ad Celestinum_. Mansi, IV,\r\n1330-1338.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The letter is very long and gives an almost complete history of\r\n    the council. It may be found complete in PNF, _loc. cit._, p. 237.\r\n    It is of special importance in connection with the Pelagian\r\n    controversy, as it states that the Council of Ephesus had\r\n    confirmed the Western deposition of the Pelagians.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters were read which were written to him [Nestorius] by the most\r\nholy and reverend bishop of the church of Alexandria, Cyril, which the\r\nholy synod approved as being orthodox and without fault, and in no point\r\nout of agreement, either with the divinely inspired Scriptures, or with\r\nthe faith handed down and set forth in the great synod by the holy Fathers\r\nwho were assembled some time ago at Nicæa, as your holiness, also rightly\r\nhaving examined this, has given witness.…\r\n\r\nWhen there had been read in the holy synod what had been done touching the\r\ndeposition of the irreligious Pelagians and Celestinians, of Celestius,\r\nPelagius, Julianus, Præsidius, Florus, Marcellinus, and Orontius, and\r\nthose inclined to like errors, we also deemed it right that the\r\ndeterminations of your holiness concerning them should stand strong and\r\nfirm. And we all were of the same mind, holding them deposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Council of Ephesus, A. D. 431, _Canons_, Bruns, I, 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The text may be found also in Hefele, § 141.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas it is needful that they who were detained from the holy synod and\r\nremained in their own district or city for any reason, ecclesiastical or\r\npersonal, should not be ignorant of the matters which were decreed by the\r\nsynod; we therefore notify your holiness and charity that——\r\n\r\nI. If any metropolitan of a province, forsaking the holy and ecumenical\r\nsynod, has joined the assembly of apostasy [the council under John of\r\nAntioch], or shall join the same hereafter; or if he has adopted, or shall\r\nadopt, the doctrines of Celestius,(185) he has no power in any way to do\r\nanything in opposition to the bishops of the province because he is\r\nalready cast forth by the synod from all ecclesiastical communion, and is\r\nwithout authority; but he shall be subjected to the same bishops of the\r\nprovince and to the neighboring bishops who hold the orthodox doctrines,\r\nto be degraded completely from his episcopal rank.\r\n\r\nII. If any provincial bishops were not present at the holy synod, and have\r\njoined or attempted to join the apostasy; or if, after subscribing to the\r\ndeposition of Nestorius, they went back to the assembly of apostasy,\r\nthese, according to the decree of the holy synod, are to be deposed\r\ncompletely from the priesthood and degraded from their rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Council of Ephesus, A. D. 431, _Manifesto of John of Antioch and his\r\ncouncil against Cyril and his council_. Mansi, IV, 1271.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe holy synod assembled in Ephesus, by the grace of God and at the\r\ncommand of the pious emperors, declares: We should indeed have wished to\r\nbe able to hold a synod in peace, according to the canons of the holy\r\nFathers and the letters of our most pious and Christ-loving emperors; but\r\nbecause you held a separate assembly from a heretical, insolent, and\r\nobstinate disposition, although, according to the letters of our most\r\npious emperors, we were in the neighborhood, and because you have filled\r\nboth the city and the holy synod with every sort of confusion, in order to\r\nprevent the examination of points agreeing with the Apollinarian, Arian,\r\nand Eunomian heresies and impieties, and have not waited for the arrival\r\nof the most religious bishops summoned from all regions by our pious\r\nemperors, and when the most magnificent Count Candidianus warned you and\r\nadmonished you in writing and verbally that you should not hear such a\r\nmatter, but await the common judgment of all the most holy bishops;\r\ntherefore know thou, O Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, and thou, O Memnon,\r\nbishop of this city, that ye are dismissed and deposed from all sacerdotal\r\nfunctions as the originators and leaders of all this disorder and\r\nlawlessness, and those who have violated the canons of the Fathers and the\r\nimperial decrees. And all ye others who seditiously and wickedly, and\r\ncontrary to all ecclesiastical sanctions and the royal decrees, gave your\r\nconsent are excommunicated until you acknowledge your fault and reform and\r\naccept anew the faith set forth by the holy Fathers at Nicæa, adding to it\r\nnothing foreign or different, and until ye anathematize the heretical\r\npropositions of Cyril, which are plainly repugnant to evangelical and\r\napostolic doctrine, and in all things comply with the letters of our most\r\npious and Christ-loving emperors, who require a peaceful and accurate\r\nconsideration of the dogma.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Creed of Antioch A. D. 433. Hahn, § 170.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This creed was probably composed by Theodoret of Cyrus, and was\r\n    sent by Count Johannes to the Emperor Theodosius in 431 as\r\n    expressing the teaching of the Antiochian party. The bitterest\r\n    period of the Nestorian controversy was after the council which is\r\n    commonly regarded as having settled it. The Antiochians and the\r\n    Alexandrians attacked each other vigorously. At last, in 433,\r\n    John, bishop of Antioch, sent the creed given below to Cyril of\r\n    Alexandria, who signed it. The creed expresses accurately the\r\n    position of Nestorius. In this way a union was patched up between\r\n    the contending parties. But the irreconcilable Nestorians left the\r\n    Church permanently. This creed in the form in which it had been\r\n    presented to the Emperor was at the beginning and the end worded\r\n    somewhat differently, _cf._ Hahn, _loc. cit._, note.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe therefore acknowledge our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only\r\nbegotten, complete God and complete man, of a rational soul and body;\r\nbegotten of the Father before the ages according to His godhead, but in\r\nthe last days for us and for our salvation, of the Virgin Mary, according\r\nto the manhood; that He is of the same nature as the Father according to\r\nHis godhead, and of the same nature with us according to His manhood; for\r\na union of the two natures has been made; therefore we confess one Christ,\r\none Son, one Lord. According to this conception of the unconfused union,\r\nwe confess that the holy Virgin is Theotokos, because God the Word was\r\nmade flesh and became man, and from her conception united with Himself the\r\ntemple received from her. We recognize the evangelical and apostolic\r\nutterances concerning the Lord, making common, as in one person, the\r\ndivine and the human characteristics, but distinguishing them as in two\r\nnatures; and teaching that the godlike traits are according to the godhead\r\nof Christ, and the humble traits according to His manhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 90. The Eutychian Controversy and the Council of Chalcedon A. D. 451\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the Eutychian controversy is less a dogmatic controversy\r\nthan a struggle between the patriarchs of the East for supremacy, using\r\nparty theological differences as a support. Few passages in the history of\r\nthe Church are more painful. The union made in 433 between the Antiochian\r\nand Alexandrian parties lasted fifteen years, or until after the death of\r\nthose who entered into it. At Antioch Domnus became bishop in 442, at\r\nAlexandria Dioscurus in 444, and at Constantinople Flavian in 446. Early\r\nin 448 Dioscurus, who aimed at the domination of the East, began to attack\r\nthe Antiochians as Nestorians. In this he was supported at Constantinople\r\nby Chrysaphius, the all-powerful minister of the weak Theodosius II, and\r\nthe archimandrite Eutyches, the godfather of the minister. Eusebius of\r\nDorylæum thereupon accused Eutyches, who held the Alexandrian position in\r\nan extreme form, of being heretical on the doctrine of the Incarnation.\r\nEutyches was condemned by Flavian at an endemic synod [_cf._ DCA, I. 474].\r\nNovember 22, 448. Both Eutyches and Flavian [_cf._ Leo the Great, _Ep._\r\n21, 22] thereupon turned to Leo, bishop of Rome. Leo, abandoning the\r\ntraditional Roman alliance with Alexandria, on which Dioscurus had\r\ncounted, supported Flavian, sending him June 13, 449, a dogmatic epistle\r\n(the _Tome, Ep._ 28) defining, in the terms of Western theology, the point\r\nat issue. A synod was now called by Theodosius at Ephesus, August, 449, in\r\nwhich Dioscurus with the support of the court triumphed. Eutyches was\r\nrestored, and the leaders of the Antiochian party, Flavian, Eusebius,\r\nIbas, Theodoret, and others deposed. Flavian [_cf._ Kirch, nn. 804 _ff._],\r\nEusebius, and Theodoret appealed to Leo, who vigorously denounced the\r\nsynod as a council of robbers (Latrocinium Ephesinum). At the same time\r\nthe situation at the court, upon which Dioscurus depended, was completely\r\nchanged by the fall of Chrysaphius and the death of Theodosius. Pulcheria,\r\nhis sister, and Marcian, her husband, succeeded to the throne, both\r\nadherents of the Antiochian party, and opposed to the ecclesiastical\r\naspirations of Dioscurus. A new synod was now called by Marcian at\r\nChalcedon, a suburb of Constantinople. Dioscurus was deposed, as well as\r\nEutyches, but Ibas and Theodoret were restored after an examination of\r\ntheir teaching. A definition was drawn up in harmony with the _Tome_ of\r\nLeo. It was a triumph for Leo, which was somewhat lessened by the passage\r\nof canon 28, based upon the third canon of Constantinople, A. D. 381, a\r\ncouncil which was henceforth recognized as the “Second General Council.”\r\nLeo refused to approve this canon, which remained in force in the East and\r\nwas renewed at the Quinisext Council A. D. 692.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: W. Bright, _Select Sermons of S.

D. 448, _Acts_. Mansi, VI, 741 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The position of Eutyches and his condemnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inasmuch as Eutyches was no theologian and no man of letters, he\r\n    has left no worked-out statement of his position. What he taught\r\n    can be gathered only from the acts of the Council of\r\n    Constantinople A. D. 448. These were incorporated in the acts of\r\n    the Council of Ephesus, A. D. 449, and as his friends were there\r\n    they may be regarded as trustworthy. The acts of the Council of\r\n    Ephesus, A. D. 449 were read in the Council of Chalcedon, A. D.\r\n    451, and in this way the matter is known.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following passages are taken from the seventh sitting of the\r\n    Council of Constantinople, November 22, 448.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchbishop Flavian said: Do you confess that the one and the same Son, our\r\nLord Jesus Christ, is consubstantial with His Father as to His divinity,\r\nand consubstantial with His mother as to His humanity?\r\n\r\nEutyches said: When I intrusted myself to your holiness I said that you\r\nshould not ask me further what I thought concerning the Father, Son, and\r\nHoly Ghost.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop said: Do you confess Christ to be of two natures?\r\n\r\nEutyches said: I have never yet presumed to speculate concerning the\r\nnature of my God, the Lord of heaven and earth; I confess that I have\r\nnever said that He is consubstantial with us. Up to the present day I have\r\nnot said that the body of our Lord and God was consubstantial with us; I\r\nconfess that the holy Virgin is consubstantial with us, and that of her\r\nour God was incarnate.…\r\n\r\nFlorentius, the patrician, said: Since the mother is consubstantial with\r\nus, doubtless the Son is consubstantial with us.\r\n\r\nEutyches said: I have not said, you will notice, that the body of a man\r\nbecame the body of God, but the body was human, and the Lord was incarnate\r\nof the Virgin. If you wish that I should add to this that His body is\r\nconsubstantial with us, I will do this; but I do not understand the term\r\nconsubstantial in such a way that I do not deny that he is the Son of God.\r\nFormerly I spoke in general not of a consubstantiality according to the\r\nflesh; now I will do so, because your Holiness demands it.…\r\n\r\nFlorentius said: Do you or do you not confess that our Lord, who is of the\r\nVirgin, is consubstantial and of two natures after the incarnation?\r\n\r\nEutyches said: I confess that our Lord was of two natures before the union\r\n[_i.e._, the union of divinity and humanity in the incarnation], but after\r\nthe union one nature.… I follow the teaching of the blessed Cyril and the\r\nholy Fathers and the holy Athanasius, because they speak of two natures\r\nbefore the union, but after the union and incarnation they speak not of\r\ntwo natures but of one nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Condemnation of Eutyches.\r\n\r\n\r\nEutyches, formerly presbyter and archimandrite, has been shown, by what\r\nhas taken place and by his own confession, to be infected with the heresy\r\nof Valentinus and Apollinaris, and to follow stubbornly their blasphemies,\r\nand rejecting our arguments and teaching, is unwilling to consent to true\r\ndoctrines. Therefore, weeping and mourning his complete perversity, we\r\nhave decreed through our Lord Jesus Christ, who has been blasphemed by\r\nhim, that he be deprived of every sacerdotal office, that he be put out of\r\nour communion, and deprived of his position over a monastery. All who\r\nhereafter speak with him or associate with him, are to know that they also\r\nare fallen into the same penalty of excommunication.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Leo the Great, _Epistola Dogmatica_ or the _Tome_. Hahn, § 176.\r\n(MSL, 54:763.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    This letter was written to Flavian on the subject which had been\r\n    raised by the condemnation of Eutyches in 448. It is of the first\r\n    importance, not merely in the history of the Church, but also in\r\n    the history of doctrine. Yet it cannot be said that Leo advanced\r\n    beyond the traditional formulæ of the West, or struck out new\r\n    thoughts [_cf._ Augustine, _Ep._ 187, text and translation of most\r\n    important part in Norris, _Rudiments of Theology_, 1894, pp.\r\n    262-266]. It was to be read at the Council of Ephesus, 449 A. D.,\r\n    but was not. It soon became widely known, however, and was\r\n    approved at the endemic Council of Constantinople, A. D. 450, and\r\n    when read at Chalcedon, the Fathers of the council cried out:\r\n    “Peter has spoken by the mouth of Leo.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    It may be found translated in PNF, ser II, vol. XII, p. 38, and\r\n    again vol. XIV, p. 254. The best critical text is given in Hahn, §\r\n    224. A translation with valuable notes may be found in Wm. Bright,\r\n    _op. cit._ Hefele, § 176, gives a paraphrase and text with useful\r\n    notes. The most significant passages, which are here translated,\r\n    may be found in Denziger, nn. 143 _f._\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 3. Without detracting from the properties of either nature and\r\nsubstance, which came together in one person, majesty took on humility;\r\nstrength, weakness; eternity, mortality; and to pay off the debt of our\r\ncondition inviolable nature was united to passible nature, so that as\r\nproper remedy for us, one and the same mediator between God and man, the\r\nman Jesus Christ, could both die with the one and not die with the other.\r\nThus in the whole and perfect nature of true man was true God born,\r\ncomplete in what was His and complete in what was ours.…\r\n\r\nCh. 4. There enters, therefore, these lower parts of the world the Son of\r\nGod, descending from His heavenly seat, and not quitting the glory of His\r\nFather, begotten in a new order by a new nativity. In a new order: because\r\nHe who was invisible in His own nature, was made visible in ours; He who\r\nwas incomprehensible [could not be contained], became comprehensible in\r\nours; remaining before all times, He began to be in time; the Lord of all,\r\nHe took upon Him the form of a servant, having obscured His immeasurable\r\nmajesty. He who was God, incapable of suffering, did not disdain to be\r\nman, capable of suffering, and the immortal to subject Himself to the laws\r\nof death. Born by a new nativity: because the inviolate virginity knew not\r\nconcupiscence, it ministered the material of the flesh. The nature of the\r\nLord was assumed from the mother, not sin; and in the Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nborn of the womb of the Virgin, because His nativity is wonderful, yet is\r\nHis nature not dissimilar to ours. For He who is true God, is likewise\r\ntrue man, and there is no fraud(186) since both the humility of the man\r\nand the loftiness of God meet.(187) For as God is not changed by the\r\nmanifestation of pity, so the man is not consumed [absorbed] by the\r\ndignity. For each form [_i.e._, nature] does in communion with the other\r\nwhat is proper to it [_agit enim utraque forma cum alterius communione\r\nquod proprium est_]; namely, by the action of the Word what is of the\r\nWord, and by the flesh carrying out what is of the flesh. One of these is\r\nbrilliant with miracles, the other succumbs to injuries. And as the Word\r\ndoes not depart from equality with the paternal glory, so the flesh does\r\nnot forsake the nature of our race.(188)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Council of Chalcedon, A. D. 451, _Definition_. Mansi, VII, 107.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The definition of Chalcedon lays down the fundamental principles\r\n    upon which rests the doctrine of the incarnation, both in Eastern\r\n    and Western theology. It is the necessary complement and result of\r\n    the discussion that led to the definition of Nicæa, and is\r\n    theologically second only to that in importance. At Nicæa the true\r\n    and eternal deity of the Son who became incarnate was defined; at\r\n    Chalcedon the true, complete, and abiding humanity of manhood of\r\n    the incarnate Son of God. In this way two natures were asserted to\r\n    be in the incarnate Logos. According to Chalcedon, which came\r\n    after the Nestorian and the Eutychian controversies, these natures\r\n    are neither to be confused so that the divine nature suffers or\r\n    the human nature is lost in the divine, nor to be separated so as\r\n    to constitute two persons. The definition was, however, not\r\n    preceded by any clear understanding of what was to be understood\r\n    by nature in relation to hypostasis. This was left for later\r\n    discussion. There was even then left open the question as to the\r\n    relation of the will to the nature, and this gave rise to the\r\n    Monothelete controversy (see § 110). But the definition of\r\n    Chalcedon is important not merely for the history of doctrine but\r\n    also for the general history of the Church. The course of\r\n    Christianity in the East depends upon the great controversies, and\r\n    in Monophysitism the Church of the East was split into permanent\r\n    divisions. The divisions of the Eastern Church prepared the way\r\n    for the Moslem conquests. The attempts made to set aside the\r\n    definition of Chalcedon as a political move led to a temporary\r\n    schism between the East and the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In this definition, it should be noted, the Council of\r\n    Constantinople, A. D. 381, for the first time takes its place\r\n    alongside of Nicæa and Ephesus, A. D. 431, and the so-called creed\r\n    of Constantinople is placed on the same level as the creed put\r\n    forth at Nicæa. The creed of Constantinople eventually took the\r\n    place of the creed of Nicæa even in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The text of the definition may be found in its most important\r\n    dogmatic part in Hefele, § 193; Hahn, § 146; Denziger, n. 148. For\r\n    a general description of the council, see Evagrius, _Hist. Ec._,\r\n    II, 3, 4. Extracts from the acts in PNF, ser. II, vol. XIV, 243\r\n    _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe holy, great, and ecumenical synod, assembled by the grace of God and\r\nthe command of our most religious and Christian Emperors Marcian and\r\nValentinian, Augusti, at Chalcedon, the metropolis of the province of\r\nBithynia, in the martyry of the holy and victorious martyr Euphemia, has\r\ndecreed as follows:\r\n\r\nOur Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, when strengthening the knowledge of the\r\nfaith in his disciples, to the end that no one might disagree with his\r\nneighbor concerning the doctrines of religion, and that the proclamation\r\nof the truth might be set forth equally to all men, said: “My peace I\r\nleave with you, my peace I give unto you.” But since the Evil One does not\r\ndesist from sowing tares among the seeds of godliness, but ever invents\r\nsomething new against the truth, therefore the Lord, providing, as He ever\r\ndoes, for the human race, has raised up this pious, faithful, and zealous\r\nsovereign, and He has called together unto Himself from all parts the\r\nchief rulers of the priesthood, so that, with the grace of Christ, our\r\ncommon Lord, inspiring us, we may cast off every plague of falsehood from\r\nthe sheep of Christ and feed them with the tender leaves of truth. And\r\nthis we have done, with unanimous consent driving away erroneous doctrine\r\nand renewing the unerring faith of the Fathers, publishing to all the\r\ncreed of the three hundred and eighteen [_i.e._, the creed of Nicæa], and\r\nto their number adding as Fathers those who have received the same summary\r\nof religion. Such are the one hundred and fifty who afterward assembled in\r\ngreat Constantinople and ratified the same faith. Moreover, observing the\r\norder and every form relating to the faith which was observed by the holy\r\nsynod formerly held in Ephesus, of which Celestine of Rome and Cyril of\r\nAlexandria, of holy memory, were the leaders [_i.e._, Ephesus A. D. 431],\r\nwe do declare that the exposition of the right and blameless faith made by\r\nthe three hundred and eighteen holy and blessed Fathers, assembled at\r\nNicæa in the reign of Constantine, of pious memory, shall be pre-eminent,\r\nand that those things shall be of force also which were decreed by the one\r\nhundred and fifty holy Fathers at Constantinople for the uprooting of the\r\nheresies which had then sprung up and for the confirmation of the same\r\nCatholic and apostolic faith of ours.\r\n\r\nThen follow:\r\n\r\n“The Creed of the Three Hundred and Eighteen Fathers at Nicæa.” The\r\nso-called Constantinopolitan creed, without the “filioque.”\r\n\r\nThis wise and salutary formula of divine grace sufficed for the perfect\r\nknowledge and confirmation of religion; for it teaches the perfect\r\ndoctrine concerning Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and sets forth the\r\nincarnation of the Lord to them that faithfully receive it. But forasmuch\r\nas persons undertaking to make void the preaching of the truth have\r\nthrough their individual heresies given rise to empty babblings, some of\r\nthem daring to corrupt the mystery of the Lord’s incarnation for us and\r\nrefusing to use the name Theotokos in reference to the Virgin, while\r\nothers bringing in a confusion and mixture, and idly conceiving that there\r\nis one nature of the flesh and the godhead, maintaining that the divine\r\nnature of the Only begotten is by mixture capable of suffering; therefore\r\nthis present, great, and ecumenical synod, desiring to exclude from them\r\nevery device against the truth and teaching that which is unchanged from\r\nthe beginning, has at the very outset decreed that the faith of the three\r\nhundred and eighteen Fathers shall be preserved inviolate. And on account\r\nof them that contend against the Holy Ghost, it confirms the doctrine\r\nafterward delivered concerning the substance of the Spirit by the one\r\nhundred and fifty holy Fathers assembled in the imperial city, which\r\ndoctrine they declare unto all men, not as though they were introducing\r\nanything that had been lacking in their predecessors, but in order to\r\nexplain through written documents their faith concerning the Holy Ghost\r\nagainst those who were seeking to destroy His sovereignty. And on account\r\nof those who are attempting to corrupt the mystery of the dispensation\r\n[_i.e._, the incarnation], and who shamelessly pretend that He who was\r\nborn of the holy Virgin Mary was a mere man, it receives the synodical\r\nletters of the blessed Cyril, pastor of the church of Alexandria,\r\naddressed to Nestorius and to the Easterns,(189) judging them suitable for\r\nthe refutation of the frenzied folly of Nestorius and for the instruction\r\nof those who long with holy ardor for a knowledge of the saving symbol.\r\nAnd to these it has rightly added for the confirmation of the orthodox\r\ndoctrines the letter of the president of the great and old Rome, the most\r\nblessed and holy Archbishop Leo, which was addressed to Archbishop\r\nFlavian, of blessed memory,(190) for the removal of the false doctrines of\r\nEutyches, judging them to be agreeable to the confession of the great\r\nPeter and to be a common pillar against misbelievers. For it opposes those\r\nwho would rend the mystery of the dispensation into a duad of Sons; it\r\nrepels from the sacred assembly those who dared to say that the godhead of\r\nthe Only begotten is capable of suffering; it resists those who imagine\r\nthere is a mixture or confusion in the two natures of Christ; it drives\r\naway those who fancy His form as a servant is of an heavenly or of some\r\nsubstance other than that which was taken of us,(191) and it anathematizes\r\nthose who foolishly talk of two natures of our Lord before the union,(192)\r\nconceiving that after the union there was only one.(193)\r\n\r\nFollowing the holy Fathers,(194) we all with one voice teach men to\r\nconfess that the Son and our Lord Jesus Christ is one and the same, that\r\nHe is perfect in godhead and perfect in manhood, truly God and truly man,\r\nof a reasonable soul and body, consubstantial with His Father as touching\r\nHis godhead, and consubstantial with us as to His manhood,(195) in all\r\nthings like unto us, without sin; begotten of His Father before all worlds\r\naccording to His godhead; but in these last days for us and for our\r\nsalvation of the Virgin Mary, the Theotokos, according to His manhood, one\r\nand the same Christ, Son, Lord, only begotten Son,(196) in(197) two\r\nnatures, unconfusedly, immutably, indivisibly, inseparably; the\r\ndistinction of natures being preserved and concurring in one person and\r\nhypostasis,(198) not separated or divided into two persons, but one and\r\nthe same Son and Only begotten, God the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ, as\r\nthe prophets from the beginning have spoken concerning Him, and as the\r\nLord Jesus Christ himself has taught us, and as the creed of the Fathers\r\nhas delivered us.\r\n\r\nThese things having been expressed by us with great accuracy and\r\nattention, the holy ecumenical synod decrees that no one shall be\r\npermitted to bring forward another faith,(199) nor to write, nor to\r\ncompose, nor to excogitate, nor to teach such to others. But such as dare\r\nto compose another faith, or to bring forward, or to teach, or to deliver\r\nanother creed to such as wish to be converted to the knowledge of the\r\ntruth from among the Gentiles or the Jews, or any heresy whatever; if they\r\nbe bishops or clerics, let them be deposed, the bishops from the\r\nepiscopate, the clerics from the clerical rank; but if they be monks or\r\nlaymen, let them be anathematized.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Council of Chalcedon, A.

With this canon should be compared Canons 9 and 17\r\n    of Chalcedon, which, taken with Canon 28, make Constantinople\r\n    supreme in the East.

For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of Old\r\nRome, because it was the royal city, and the one hundred and fifty most\r\nreligious bishops, moved by the same considerations, gave equal privileges\r\nto the most holy throne of New Rome, judging with good reason that the\r\ncity which is honored with the sovereignty and the Senate, and also enjoys\r\nequal privileges with old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters\r\nalso be magnified as she is, and rank next after her; so that in the\r\ndioceses of Pontus, Asia, and Thrace the metropolitans, and such bishops\r\nalso of the dioceses aforesaid as are among the barbarians, should be\r\nordained only by the aforesaid most holy throne of the most holy Church of\r\nConstantinople; every metropolitan of the aforesaid dioceses together with\r\nthe bishops of his province ordaining bishops of the province, as has been\r\ndeclared by the divine canons; but that, as has been said above, the\r\nmetropolitans of the aforesaid dioceses shall be ordained by the\r\narchbishop of Constantinople, after the proper elections have been held\r\naccording to custom and have been reported to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Council of Chalcedon, A.

But if not, let our\r\nprotest be placed in these acts [_i.e._, the minutes of the council then\r\nbeing approved], so that we may know clearly what we are to report to that\r\napostolic and chief bishop of the whole Church [Latin text: to that\r\napostolic man and Pope of the universal Church], so that he may be able to\r\ntake action with regard either to the indignity done to his see or to the\r\nsetting at naught of the canons.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 91. Results of the Decision of Chalcedon: the Rise of Schisms from the\r\nMonophysite Controversy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe definition of the Council of Chalcedon, in spite of its condemnation\r\nof Nestorius and its approval of the letters of Cyril, was a triumph of\r\nthe Antiochian school and a condemnation of Alexandrian theology. At\r\nChalcedon no more than at Nicæa was a controversy settled. So far from\r\nbeing settled at the council, Monophysitism began with it its long career\r\nin the Eastern Church only to end in permanent schisms. As soon as the\r\nresults of Chalcedon were known the Church was in an uproar. Riots broke\r\nout in Jerusalem against the patriarch. At Alexandria, Timothy Ælurus, a\r\nMonophysite, was able to drive out the orthodox patriarch. In Antioch,\r\nPetrus Fullo did the same and added to the liturgical Trisagion [Is. 6:3]\r\nthe Theopaschite phrase: “God who was crucified for us.” The Emperor\r\nMarcian died 457 and was succeeded by Leo I (457-474). His grandson Leo II\r\n(474) was succeeded by his father Zeno (474-475, 477-491). Zeno was\r\ntemporarily deposed by Basiliscus (475-477), who, basing his authority\r\nupon the Monophysite faction, issued an Encyclion condemning Chalcedon and\r\nLeo’s Epistle, and making Monophysitism the religion of the Empire. Zeno\r\nwas restored by a Dyophysite faction under the lead of Acacius, patriarch\r\nof Constantinople. Zeno, to win back the Monophysites, issued in 482 the\r\n_Henoticon_, setting aside Chalcedon and making only the definition of\r\nNicæa authoritative. Dissatisfaction arose on both sides, and minor\r\nschisms in the East took place. With Rome a schism arose lasting 484-519.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Evagrius, _Hist. Ec._, lib.

(MSG, 86, II:2600.) _Cf._ Kirch, nn. 879 _f._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Although an anti-encyclion was issued in 477 condemning Eutyches\r\n    as well as Nestorius, the attempts of Basiliscus were in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Cæsar Basiliscus, pious, victorious, triumphant, supreme,\r\never-worshipful Augustus, and Marcus, the most noble Cæsar, to Timotheus,\r\narchbishop of the great city of the Alexandrians, most reverend and\r\nbeloved of God.\r\n\r\nWhatever laws the pious emperors before us, who worshipped the blessed and\r\nimmortal and life-giving Trinity, have decreed in behalf of the true and\r\napostolic faith, these laws, we say, as always beneficial for the whole\r\nworld, we will at no time to be inoperative, but rather we promulgate them\r\nas our own. We, preferring piety and zeal in the cause of our God and\r\nSaviour, Jesus Christ, who created and has made us glorious before all\r\ndiligence in human affairs, and also believing that concord among the\r\nflocks of Christ is the preservation of ourselves and our subjects, the\r\nfirm foundation and unshaken bulwark of our Empire, and, accordingly,\r\nbeing rightly moved with godly zeal and offering to God and our Saviour,\r\nJesus Christ, the unity of the holy Church as the first-fruits of our\r\nreign, do ordain as the basis and confirmation of human felicity, namely,\r\nthe symbol of the three hundred and eighteen holy Fathers who were in time\r\npast assembled with the Holy Ghost at Nicæa, into which both ourselves and\r\nall our believing subjects were baptized; that this alone should have\r\nreception and authority with the orthodox people in all the most holy\r\nchurches of God as the only formulary of the right faith, and sufficient\r\nfor the utter destruction of all heresy and for the complete unity of the\r\nholy churches of God; the acts of the one hundred and fifty holy Fathers\r\nassembled in this imperial city, in confirmation of the sacred symbol\r\nitself and in condemnation of those who blasphemed against the Holy Ghost,\r\nretaining their own force; as well as of all done in the metropolitan city\r\nof the Ephesians against the impious Nestorius and those who subsequently\r\nfavored his opinions.(200) But the proceedings which have disturbed the\r\nunity and good order of the holy churches of God, and the peace of the\r\nwhole world, that is to say, the so-called _Tome_ of Leo, and all things\r\ndone at Chalcedon in innovation upon the before-mentioned holy symbol of\r\nthe three hundred and eighteen holy Fathers, whether by way of definition\r\nof the faith or setting forth of symbols, or interpretation, or\r\ninstruction, or discourse; we decree that these shall be anathematized\r\nboth here and everywhere by all the most holy bishops in every church and\r\nshall be given to the flames by whomsoever they shall be found, insomuch\r\nas it was so enjoined respecting all heretical doctrines by our\r\npredecessors of pious and blessed memory, Constantine and Theodosius the\r\nyounger [_v. supra_, § 73], and that, having thus been rendered null, they\r\nshall be utterly cast out from the one and only Catholic and Apostolic\r\nOrthodox Church, as superseding the everlasting and saving definitions of\r\nthe three hundred and eighteen Fathers, and those of the blessed Fathers\r\nwho, by the Holy Ghost, decreed at Ephesus [it is possible that there is a\r\nfault in the text here; the expected reading of the passage would be: and\r\nof the one hundred and fifty bishops who decreed concerning the Holy\r\nSpirit; and of those who were assembled at Ephesus] that no one, either of\r\nthe priesthood or laity, be allowed to deviate in any respect from that\r\nmost sacred constitution of the holy symbol, and we decree that these be\r\nanathematized together with all the innovations upon the sacred symbol\r\nwhich were made at Chalcedon and the heresy of those who do not confess\r\nthat the only begotten Son of God was truly incarnate and made man of the\r\nHoly Ghost and of the holy and ever-virgin Mary, Theotokos, but falsely\r\nallege that either from heaven or in mere phantasy and seeming He took\r\nflesh; and, in short, every heresy and whatever else at any time in any\r\nmanner or place in the whole world, in either thought or word, has been\r\ndevised as an innovation upon and in derogation of the sacred symbol. And\r\ninasmuch as it belongs especially to imperial providence to furnish to\r\ntheir subjects, with forecasting deliberation, security not only for the\r\npresent but for the future, we decree that everywhere the most holy\r\nbishops shall subscribe to this our sacred circular letter when exhibited\r\nto them, and shall distinctly declare that they submit to the sacred\r\nsymbol of the three hundred and eighteen holy Fathers alone, which the one\r\nhundred and fifty holy Fathers confirmed, as it was also defined by the\r\nmost holy Fathers who subsequently assembled in the metropolitan city of\r\nthe Ephesians, that they should submit to the sacred symbol of the three\r\nhundred and eighteen holy Fathers, as the definition of faith, and shall\r\nanathematize everything done at Chalcedon as an offence to the orthodox\r\npeople and utterly cast it out of the churches as an impediment to the\r\ngeneral happiness and our own.(201) Those, moreover, who after the issuing\r\nof this our sacred letter, which we trust has been issued according to\r\nGod, in an endeavor to bring about that unity which all desire for the\r\nholy churches of God, shall attempt to bring forward or so much as to name\r\nthe innovation upon the faith made at Chalcedon, either in discourse,\r\ninstruction, or writing, in whatsoever manner or place—those persons, as\r\nthe cause of confusion and tumult in the churches of God and among the\r\nwhole body of our subjects, and as enemies of God and to our safety, we\r\ncommand (in accordance with the laws ordained by our predecessor\r\nTheodosius, of blessed and pious memory, against such sorts of evil\r\ndesigns, which laws are subjoined to this our sacred circular) that, if\r\nthey be bishops or clergy, they be deposed; if monks or laymen, that they\r\nbe subjected to banishment and every mode of confiscation and the severest\r\npenalties. For so the holy and homoousian Trinity, the Creator and\r\nLife-giver of the universe, which has ever been adored by us in piety, now\r\nalso is served by us in the destruction of the before-mentioned tares and\r\nthe confirmation of the true and apostolic traditions of the holy symbol,\r\nbecoming favorable and gracious both to our souls and to every one of our\r\nsubjects, shall ever aid us and preserve in peace human affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Zeno, _Henoticon_; in Evagrius, _Hist. Ec._, III, 14. (MSG, 86,\r\nII:2620.) _Cf._ Kirch, nn. 883 _f._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Zeno published his _Henoticon_ in 482 as an attempt to win back\r\n    the Monophysites. Evagrius says, in a note to the document: “When\r\n    these things were read, those who were in Alexandria were joined\r\n    to the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.” The effect so far as\r\n    the West went was just the opposite. Felix III protested and\r\n    threatened. But Acacius, bishop of Constantinople, who was chiefly\r\n    responsible for the document, refused to listen. Felix (_cf._\r\n    Evagrius, III, 18) and Acacius thereupon issued mutual\r\n    excommunications. On the accession of the Emperor Anastasius\r\n    [491-518] the _Henoticon_ continued in force, as his sympathies\r\n    were with the Monophysites. It will be noted that the _Henoticon_\r\n    not merely sets aside Chalcedon but introduces phrases which make\r\n    it appear that the same moral subject is present in every act,\r\n    whether of humility or majesty, and that it is God who suffers.\r\n    These are characteristic Monophysite positions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Cæsar Zeno, pious, victorious, triumphant, supreme,\r\never-worshipful Augustus, to the most reverend bishops and clergy, and to\r\nthe monks and laity throughout Alexandria, Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis.\r\n\r\nBeing assured that the origin and constitution, the might and invincible\r\nshield of our sovereignty, is the only right and true faith, which the\r\nthree hundred and eighteen holy Fathers assembled at Nicæa set forth by\r\ndivine inspiration, and the one hundred and fifty holy Fathers who in like\r\nmanner met at Constantinople, confirmed; we night and day employ every\r\nmeans of prayer, of zealous care, and of laws, that the holy Catholic and\r\nApostolic Church of God in every place may be multiplied, which is the\r\nincorruptible and immortal mother of our sceptre; and that the pious\r\nlaity, continuing in peace and unanimity in respect to God, may, together\r\nwith the bishops, highly beloved of God, the most pious clergy, the\r\narchimandrites, and monks, offer up acceptably their supplications in\r\nbehalf of our sovereignty. So long as our great God and Saviour, Jesus\r\nChrist, who was made man and brought forth of Mary, the holy Virgin and\r\nTheotokos, approves and readily accepts the praise we render by concord\r\nand our service, the power of enemies will be crushed and swept away, and\r\nall will bend their necks to our power, which is according to God, and\r\npeace and its blessings, kindly temperature, abundant produce, and\r\nwhatever else is beneficial will be liberally bestowed upon men. Since,\r\nthen, the irreprehensible faith is the preserver of both ourselves and\r\nRoman affairs, petitions have been offered to us from pious archimandrites\r\nand hermits and other venerable persons, imploring with tears that there\r\nbe unity for the most holy churches, and the parts should be joined to\r\nparts which the enemy of all good has of old time attempted to keep apart,\r\nknowing that, if he assails the body of the Church sound and complete, he\r\nwill be defeated. For, since it happens that of unnumbered generations\r\nwhich during the lapse of so many years in time have withdrawn from life,\r\nsome have departed deprived of the laver of regeneration, and others have\r\nbeen borne away on the inevitable journey of man without having partaken\r\nof the divine communion; and innumerable murders have also been committed;\r\nand not only the earth, but the very air has been filled by a multitude of\r\nblood-sheddings, who would not pray that this state of things might be\r\ntransformed into good? For this reason we were anxious that you should\r\nknow that neither we nor the churches everywhere have ever held or shall\r\nhold, nor are we aware of any persons who hold, any other symbol or\r\nteaching or definition of faith or creed than the aforementioned holy\r\nsymbol of the three hundred and eighteen holy Fathers, which the aforesaid\r\none hundred and fifty holy Fathers confirmed. If any person should hold\r\nsuch, we regard him as an alien; for we are confident that this symbol\r\nalone is, as we said, the preserver of our sovereignty. And all the people\r\ndesiring the saving illumination were baptized, receiving this faith only,\r\nand this the holy Fathers assembled at Ephesus also followed; who deposed\r\nthe impious Nestorius and those who subsequently held his sentiments. And\r\nthis Nestorius we also anathematize, together with Eutyches and all who\r\nentertain opinions contrary to the above-mentioned, receiving at the same\r\ntime the twelve chapters of Cyril, of holy memory, formerly archbishop of\r\nthe holy Catholic Church of the Alexandrians. We confess, moreover, that\r\nthe only begotten Son of God, himself God, who truly became man, namely,\r\nour Lord Jesus Christ, is consubstantial with the Father as to his\r\ngodhead, and the same consubstantial with ourselves as respects his\r\nmanhood; that having descended and become flesh of the Holy Ghost and\r\nMary, the Virgin and Theotokos, He is one and not two; for we affirm that\r\nboth His miracles and the sufferings which He voluntarily endured in the\r\nflesh, are of one; for we do not in any degree admit those who either make\r\na division or a confusion or introduce a phantom; inasmuch as His truly\r\nsinless incarnation from the Theotokos did not produce an addition of a\r\nson, because the Trinity continued as a Trinity, even when one of the\r\nTrinity, God the Word, did become incarnate. Knowing, then, that neither\r\nthe holy orthodox churches of God in all places nor the priests, highly\r\nbeloved of God, who are at their head, nor our own sovereignty, have\r\nallowed or do allow any other symbol or definition of faith than the\r\nbefore-mentioned holy teaching, we have united ourselves thereunto without\r\nhesitation. And these things we write, not as making an innovation upon\r\nthe faith, but to satisfy you; and every one who has held or holds any\r\nother opinion, either at the present or at another time, whether at\r\nChalcedon or in any synod whatever, we anathematize; and specially the\r\naforementioned Nestorius and Eutyches, and those who maintain their\r\ndoctrines. Link yourselves, therefore, to the spiritual mother, the\r\nChurch, and in her enjoy divine communion with us, according to the\r\naforesaid one and only definition of the faith of the three hundred and\r\neighteen holy Fathers. For your all-holy mother, the Church, waits to\r\nembrace you as true children, and longs to hear your gentle voice so long\r\nwithheld. Speed yourselves, therefore, for by so doing you will both draw\r\ntoward yourselves the favor of our Master and Saviour and God, Jesus\r\nChrist, and be commended by our sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 92. The Church of Italy under the Ostrogoths and during the first Schism\r\nbetween Rome and the Eastern Church\r\n\r\n\r\nThe schism between New and Old Rome lasted from 484 to 517, but attempts\r\nwere made on both sides to end the deplorable situation. The two\r\nsuccessors of Acacius were willing to resume communion with Rome and\r\nrestore the name of the bishop of Rome to the diptychs, but refused to\r\ntake the names of their predecessors from the same, as required by the\r\nlatter. Gelasius (492-496), Anastasius II (496-498), and Symmachus\r\n(498-514) held firmly but unavailingly to the Roman contention that,\r\nbefore any communion was possible, the name of Acacius must be struck from\r\nthe diptychs—in the case of the dead an act as condemnatory as\r\nexcommunication in the case of the living. Meanwhile the Roman see boldly\r\nasserted the independence of the Church, and protested against the action\r\nof the Emperor in setting aside the decree of Chalcedon as usurpation and\r\ntyranny. This is most clearly set forth by Gelasius, in his epistle to the\r\nEmperor Anastasius. The schism finally came to an end in 519, in\r\naccordance with the ecclesiastical policy of Justinian, and at that time\r\nthe _Formula_ of Hormisdas (514-523) was accepted by the heads of the\r\nEastern Church by an act constituting a complete surrender of the claims\r\nof the Orientals.\r\n\r\nWhile the schism was still existing and Rome was treating with the East\r\nupon an independent footing, the situation in Italy was far less\r\nbrilliant. The Arian king, the Ostrogoth Theodoric (489, 493-526) ruled\r\nItaly, and the attitude of the Roman see was far less authoritative toward\r\nthe local ruler. It was, however, a period of great importance for the\r\nfuture of the Church; Boethius, Cassiodorus, Dionysius Exiguus, and\r\nBenedict of Nursia (_v. infra_, §§ 104, 105) all belong to this period and\r\nthe decree of Gelasius, _De Recipiendis Libris_, was of permanent\r\ninfluence upon the theological science of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Cassiodorus, _Varia_, Eng. trans.\r\n    (condensed), by T.

Greenwood, _Cathedra Petri_, II, pp. 41-84, the\r\n    chapter entitled “Papal Prerogative under Popes Gelasius and\r\n    Symmachus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    After Gelasius has alluded to the circumstances in which he is\r\n    writing and excused his not writing, he mentions his natural\r\n    devotion to the Roman Emperor—being himself by birth a Roman\r\n    citizen—his desire as a Christian to share with him the right\r\n    faith, and as vicar of the Apostolic See his constant anxiety to\r\n    maintain the true faith; he then proceeds:\r\n\r\n\r\nI beseech your piety not to regard as arrogance duty in divine affairs.\r\nFar be it from a Roman prince, I pray, to regard as injury truth that has\r\nbeen intimated to him. For, indeed, there are, O Emperor Augustus, two by\r\nwhom principally this world is ruled: the sacred authority of the pontiffs\r\nand the royal power. Of these the importance of the priests is so much the\r\ngreater, as even for kings of men they will have to give an account in the\r\ndivine judgment. Know, indeed, most clement son, that although you\r\nworthily rule over the human race, yet as a man of devotion in divine\r\nmatters you submit your neck to the prelates, and also from them you await\r\nthe matters of your salvation, and in making use of the celestial\r\nsacraments and in administering those things you know that you ought, as\r\nis right, to be subjected to the order of religion rather than preside\r\nover it; know likewise that in regard to these things you are dependent\r\nupon their judgment and you should not bend them to your will. For if, so\r\nfar as it pertains to the order of public discipline, the priests of\r\nreligion, knowing that the imperial power has been bestowed upon you by\r\ndivine providence, obey your laws, lest in affairs of exclusively mundane\r\ndetermination they might seem to resist, with how much more gladness, I\r\nask, does it become you to obey them who have been assigned to the duty of\r\nperforming the divine mysteries. Just as there is no light risk for the\r\npontiffs to be silent about those things which belong to the service of\r\nthe divinity, so there is no small peril (which God forbid) to those who,\r\nwhen they ought to obey, refuse to do so. And if it is right that the\r\nhearts of the faithful be submitted to all priests generally who treat\r\nrightly divine things, how much more is obedience to be shown to the\r\nprelate of that see which the highest divinity wished to be pre-eminent\r\nover all priests and which the devotion of the whole Church continually\r\nhonors?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Gelasius, _Epist. de Recipiendis et non Recipiendis Libris_. Mansi,\r\nVIII, 153 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    This decretal is evidently made of matter of different dates, as\r\n    has been shown by Hefele, § 217, and probably contains matter\r\n    which may be later than Gelasius. In the first section of the\r\n    decretal is a list of the canonical books of the Bible, as in the\r\n    Vulgate; the decretal then sets forth the claims of the Roman see\r\n    (§ 2), the books to be received (§ 3), and the books which the\r\n    Roman Church rejects (§ 4). In respect to several there are\r\n    various comments added, but these have in several cases been\r\n    omitted for the sake of brevity, where they are of less\r\n    importance. Portions of the decretal in Denziger, nn. 162-164; the\r\n    full text of the decretal may be found in Mansi VIII, 153 _ff._\r\n    Preuschen, _Analecta_, vol. II, pp. 52 _ff._; Mirbt, n. 168.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Although the one dwelling of the universal Catholic Church spread\r\nthrough the world is of Christ, the holy Roman Church, however, has been\r\nplaced before the other churches by no synodical decrees, but has obtained\r\nthe primacy by the evangelic voice of our Lord and Saviour, saying, “Thou\r\nart Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,” etc.(202) To it was\r\ngiven the fellowship of the most blessed Apostle Paul, that chosen vessel\r\nwho not at a different time, as heretics prate, but at one time and on one\r\nand the same day by a glorious death, was crowned together with Peter in\r\nagony in the city of Rome under the Emperor Nero. And they equally\r\nconsecrated the said holy Roman Church to Christ and placed it over all\r\nthe others in the whole world by their presence and venerable triumph.\r\n\r\nIII. Therefore the first see of Peter the Apostle is the Roman Church, not\r\nhaving any spot or wrinkle or any such thing. The second see was\r\nconsecrated at Alexandria in the name of the blessed Peter by Mark, his\r\ndisciple and the evangelist. He himself, having been directed by the\r\nApostle Peter to Egypt, preached the word of truth and consummated a\r\nglorious martyrdom. But as the third see of the same most blessed Apostle\r\nPeter is held the see of Antioch, since he held that before he came to\r\nRome, and there the name of the new people, the name of Christians, arose.\r\n\r\nIV. 1. And although no other foundation can be laid than that which has\r\nbeen laid, which is Christ Jesus, yet after the writings of the Old and\r\nNew Testaments,(203) which we receive regularly, the same holy Roman\r\nChurch does not prohibit these following writings to be received for the\r\npurposes of edification:\r\n\r\n2. The holy synod of Nicæa, according to the three hundred and eighteen\r\nFathers, under the Emperor Constantine.\r\n\r\n3. The holy synod of Ephesus, in which Nestorius was condemned with the\r\nconsent of the most blessed Pope [_papa_] Celestine, held under Cyril, the\r\nprelate of the see of Alexandria, and Acadius, a bishop sent from Italy.\r\n\r\n4. The holy synod of Chalcedon, which was held under the Emperor Marcian\r\nand Anatolius, bishop of Constantinople, and in which Nestorius, Eutyches,\r\nand Dioscurus were condemned.\r\n\r\nV. 1. Likewise the works of the blessed Cæcilius Cyprianus, martyr, and\r\nbishop of Carthage; 2. … of Gregory the bishop of Nazianzus; 3. … of\r\nBasil, bishop of Cappadocia; 4. … of Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria; 5.\r\n… of John [Chrysostom], bishop of Constantinople; 6. … of Theophilus,\r\nbishop of Alexandria; 7. … of Cyril, bishop of Alexandria; 8. … of Hilary,\r\nbishop of Poitiers; 9. … of Ambrose, bishop of Milan; 10. … of Augustine,\r\nbishop of Hippo; 11. … of Jerome, the presbyter; 12. … of Prosper; 13. …\r\nlikewise the Epistle of the blessed Pope Leo to Flavian, bishop of\r\nConstantinople, against Eutyches and other heretics; and if any one\r\ndispute even so much as an iota of the text of the epistle, and will not\r\nreverently receive it in all points, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n14. Likewise the works and treatises of the orthodox Fathers are to be\r\nread, who in no respect have deviated from the union with the holy Roman\r\nChurch, nor have separated from its faith and teaching; but, by the grace\r\nof God, have shared in communion with it even to the last days of their\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n15. Likewise the decretal epistles which the most blessed Popes at\r\ndifferent times have given from the city of Rome, in reply to\r\nconsultations of various fathers, are to be reverently received.\r\n\r\n16. Likewise the acts of the holy martyrs.… But, according to an ancient\r\ncustom and singular caution, they are not to be read in the holy Roman\r\nChurch, because the names of those who wrote them are not known.…\r\n\r\n17. Likewise the lives of the fathers Paul, Antony, Hilarion, and all\r\nhermits which the most blessed Jerome has described, we receive in honor.\r\n\r\n18. Likewise the acts of the blessed Sylvester, prelate of the Apostolic\r\nSee, although the name of the writer is unknown; however, we know that it\r\nis read by many Catholics in the city of Rome, and on account of its\r\nancient use many churches have copied it.\r\n\r\n19. Likewise the writing concerning the discovery of the cross and another\r\nconcerning the discovery of the head of the blessed John the Baptist.…\r\n\r\n20. Rufinus, a most religious man, has published many books on\r\necclesiastical affairs and has also translated several writings. But\r\nbecause the venerable Jerome has criticised him in various points for his\r\nfreedom in judgment, we are of the same opinion as we know Jerome is, and\r\nnot only concerning Rufinus but all others whom, out of zeal toward God\r\nand devotion to the faith, Jerome has condemned.\r\n\r\n21. Likewise several works of Origen which the blessed Jerome does not\r\nreject we receive as to be read; the remaining works along with their\r\nauthor we declare are to be rejected.\r\n\r\n22. Likewise the chronicles of Eusebius of Cæsarea and the books of his\r\n_Ecclesiastical History_, although in the first book of his narrative he\r\nhas been a little warm and afterward he wrote one book in praise and\r\ndefence of Origen, the schismatic, yet on account of the mention of\r\nseveral things, which pertain to instruction, we say that they are to that\r\nextent not to be rejected.…\r\n\r\n23. Likewise we approve Orosius; 24. … the works of Sedulius; 25. … the\r\nworks of Juvencus.…\r\n\r\nVI. Other works which have been written by heretics or schismatics the\r\nCatholic and Apostolic Roman Church in no respect receives, and these,\r\nalthough they are not received and are to be avoided by Catholics, we\r\nbelieve ought to be added below.\r\n\r\n\r\n    There follow a list of thirty-five apocryphal gospels, acts, and\r\n    similar documents. The epistle continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n36. The book which is called _The Canons of the Apostles_; 37. the book\r\ncalled _Physiologus_, written by heretics and ascribed to Ambrose; 38. the\r\nhistory of Eusebius Pamphilius; 39. the works of Tertullian; 40. … of\r\nLactantius or Firminianus; 41. … of Africanus; 42. … Postumianus and\r\nGallus; 43. … of Montanus, Priscilla, and Maximilla; 44. … all the works\r\nof Faustus the Manichæan; 45. the works of Commodus; 46. the works of\r\nanother Clement of Alexandria; 47. the works of Thascius Cyprianus; 48. of\r\nArnobius; 49. of Tichonius; 50. of Cassianus a presbyter of Gaul; 51.\r\nVictorinus of Pettau; 52. of Frumentius the blind; 53. of Faustus of Reiz;\r\n54. the Epistle of Jesus to Abgar; 55. Passion of St. Cyricus and Julitta;\r\n56. Passion of St. Georgius; 57. the writings which are called the \"Curse\r\nof Solomon\"; 58. all phylacteries which have been written not with the\r\nnames of angels, as they pretend, but rather of demons; 59. these works\r\nand all similar to them which Simon Magus [a list of heretics down to]\r\nPeter [Fullo] and another Peter [Mongus], of whom one defiled Alexandria\r\nand the other Antioch, Acacius of Constantinople with his adherents, as\r\nalso all heretics or disciples of heretics or schismatics have taught or\r\nwritten, whose names we do not remember are not only repudiated by the\r\nentire Roman Catholic Church, but we declare are bound forever with an\r\nindissoluble anathema together with their authors and followers of their\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Hormisdas, _Formula_. Mansi, VIII, 407. _Cf._ Denziger, nn. 171 _f._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The formula which Hormisdas of Rome (514-523) proposed in 515, and\r\n    which was accepted Easter 519 by the patriarch John II of\r\n    Constantinople and many other Orientals, and which ended the\r\n    schism between Rome and Constantinople occasioned by Acacius. As\r\n    soon as this formula was accepted the leading Monophysites fled to\r\n    Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of salvation is to preserve the rule of a correct faith and\r\nto deviate in no respect from the constitutions of the fathers. And\r\nbecause the teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ cannot be allowed to fail,\r\nwho said, “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,”\r\netc. [Matt. 16:18], these things which were said are proved by the effects\r\nof things, because in the Apostolic See religion has always been preserved\r\nwithout spot or blemish. Desiring in no respect to be separated from this\r\nhope and faith, and following the constitutions of the Fathers, we\r\nanathematize all heretics, and especially the heretic Nestorius, who was\r\nonce bishop of the city of Constantinople, and condemned in the Council of\r\nEphesus by Pope Celestine and by the holy Cyril, prelate of the city of\r\nAlexandria. Likewise we anathematize Eutyches and Dioscurus of Alexandria,\r\ncondemned in the holy synod of Chalcedon which we follow and embrace;\r\nadding to these Timotheus the parricide, known as Ælurus, and also his\r\ndisciple and follower Peter [Mongus], also Acacius, who remained in the\r\nsociety of their communion; because he mixed himself with their communion\r\nhe deserves the same sentence of condemnation as they; no less condemning\r\nPeter [Fullo] of Antioch with his followers and the followers of all those\r\nabove named. We receive and approve, therefore, all the universal Epistles\r\nof Pope Leo which he wrote concerning the Christian religion. And\r\ntherefore, as we have said, following in all things the Apostolic See and\r\napproving all of its constitutions, I trust that I may be deemed worthy to\r\nbe in the communion with you, in which as the Apostolic See declares there\r\nis, complete and true, the totality of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriod III. The Dissolution Of The Imperial State Church And The\r\nTransition To The Middle Ages: From The Beginning Of The Sixth Century To\r\nThe Latter Part Of The Eighth\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third period of the ancient Church under the Christian Empire begins\r\nwith the accession of Justin I (518-527), and the end of the first schism\r\nbetween Rome and Constantinople (519). The termination of the period is\r\nnot so clearly marked. By the middle and latter part of the eighth\r\ncentury, however, the imperial Church has ceased to exist in its original\r\nconception. The Church in the East has become, in great part, a group of\r\nnational schismatic churches under Moslem rulers, and only the largest\r\nfragment of the Church of the East is the State Church of the greatly\r\nreduced Eastern empire. In the West, the imperial influence has ceased,\r\nand the Roman see has allied its fortunes with the rising Frankish power,\r\nand the rise of a Western empire is already foreshadowed.\r\n\r\nIn this period, the imperial ecclesiastical system, which had begun with\r\nConstantine, found its completion in the Cæsaropapism which was\r\ndefinitively established by Justinian as the constitution of the Eastern\r\nChurch. But at the same time the Monophysite churches seceded and became\r\npermanent national churches. The long Christological controversy found, at\r\nleast as regards Monophysitism, its settlement on a basis derived from the\r\nrevived Aristotelian philosophy; and the mystical piety of the East, with\r\nits apparatus of hierarchy and sacraments, found its characteristic\r\nexpression in the works of Dionysius the Areopagite.\r\n\r\nWhile in the East the Church was assuming its permanent form, in the West\r\nthe condition of the Church was being profoundly influenced by the\r\ncompletely changed political organization of what had been the Roman\r\nEmpire of the West, but was now parcelled out among new Germanic\r\nnationalities. The Church in the various kingdoms, in spite of its\r\nadherence to the see of Rome as the centre of Catholic unity, came, to no\r\nsmall extent, under the secular authority, and Christianity in Ireland, in\r\nSpain, among the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and even among the Lombards in\r\nItaly assumed a national character, coming largely under the control and\r\nsubject to the laws and customs of the nation. In this period were laid\r\nthe foundations of the leading ecclesiastical institutions of the Middle\r\nAges, as the Church, although still under the influence of antiquity,\r\nadapted itself and its institutions to the changed condition due to the\r\npolitical situation and took up its duty of training the rude peoples that\r\nhad come within its fold.\r\n\r\nThe seventh and eighth centuries saw the completion of the revolution in\r\nthe ecclesiastical situation. In the East, in the territories in which the\r\nnational churches of the Monophysites were established, the Moslem rule\r\nprotected them from the attempts of the orthodox emperors to enforce\r\nuniformity. The attempts made to recover their allegiance before they\r\nsuccumbed to Islam had only ended in a serious dispute within the Orthodox\r\nChurch, the Monothelete controversy, which ended in the Sixth General\r\nCouncil of 681. In Italy the Arian Lombards were gradually won to the\r\nCatholic faith, but the Roman see soon found itself embarrassed by the too\r\nnear secular authority. Accordingly, when the controversy with the East\r\nover Iconoclasm broke out, the Roman Church became practically independent\r\nof the Eastern imperial authority, and in its conflict with the Lombards\r\ncame into alliance with the rising Frankish power. With this, the\r\ntransition to the Middle Ages may be said to have been completed. It was,\r\nhowever, only the last of a series of acts whereby the Church was severing\r\nitself from the ancient order and coming into closer alliance with the new\r\norder in the life of the West. Henceforth the Church, which found its\r\ncentre in the Roman see, belongs to the West, and its relations to the\r\nEast, although no formal schism had occurred, are of continued and\r\nincreasing estrangement or alienation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Cambridge Medieval History_, vol. II, will cover the entire\r\n    period and give ample bibliographical references.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. The Church In The Eastern Empire\r\n\r\n\r\nThe century extending from the accession of Justin I (518-528) to the end\r\nof the Persian wars of Heraclius (610-641), or from 518 to 628, is the\r\nmost brilliant period of the Eastern Empire. The rise of Islam had not yet\r\ntaken place, whereby the best provinces in Asia and Africa were cut off\r\nfrom the Empire. A large part of the West was recovered under Justinian,\r\nand under Heraclius the power of Persia, the ancient enemy of the Roman\r\nEmpire, which had been a menace since the latter part of the third\r\ncentury, was completely overthrown in the most brilliant series of\r\ncampaigns since the foundation of the Roman Empire. With the death of\r\nJustin II (565-578), the family of Justin came to an end after occupying\r\nthe throne for sixty years. But under Tiberius (578-582) and Maurice\r\n(582-602) the policy of Justinian was continued in all essentials in the\r\nstereotyped form known as Byzantinism. The Church became practically a\r\ndepartment of the State and of the political machinery. The only\r\nlimitation upon the will of the Emperor was the determined resistance of\r\nthe Monophysites and smaller factions. Maurice was succeeded by the rude\r\nPhocas (602-610), whom a military revolution placed upon the throne, and\r\nwho instituted a reign of terror and blood. Upon his downfall, Heraclius\r\n(610-641) ascended the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 93. The Age of Justinian\r\n\r\n\r\nJustinian I, the greatest of all the rulers of the Eastern Empire,\r\nsucceeded his uncle Justin I (518-527); but he had, from the beginning of\r\nthe latter’s reign, exercised an ever-increasing influence over the\r\nimperial policy, and to him can be attributed the direction of\r\necclesiastical affairs from the accession of Justin. No reign among the\r\nEastern emperors was more filled with important events and successful\r\nundertakings. His first great work was the reduction of the vast mass of\r\nRoman law to what approached a system. This was accomplished in 534,\r\nresulting in the Digest, made up of the various decisions and opinions of\r\nthe most celebrated Roman legal authorities, the Codex, comprising all the\r\nstatute law then in actual force and applicable to the conditions of the\r\nEmpire, and the Institutes, a revision of the excellent introductory\r\nmanual of Gaius. No body of law reduced to writing has been more\r\ninfluential in the history of the world. The second great undertaking, or\r\nseries of undertakings, was the reconquest of the West. In 533 Belisarius\r\nrecovered North Africa to the Empire by the overthrow of the Vandal\r\nkingdom. In 554 the conquest of Italy by Belisarius and Narses was\r\ncompleted. Portions of Spain had also been recovered. No Eastern Emperor\r\nruled over a larger territory than did Justinian at the time of his death.\r\nThe third great line of work on the part of Justinian was his regulation\r\nof ecclesiastical and theological matters. In this he took an active\r\npersonal part. The end of the schism with the West had been brought about\r\nunder the reign of his uncle. Three controversies fill the reign of\r\nJustinian: the Theopaschite (519-533) over the introduction of the phrase\r\ninto the Trisagion, stating that God was crucified for us, so that the\r\nTrisagion read as follows, “Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, who was\r\ncrucified for us, have mercy upon us”; the Second Origenistic controversy\r\n(531-543) in which those elements of Origen’s teaching which had never\r\nbeen accepted by the Church were condemned along with Origen himself; and\r\nthe Three Chapters controversy, 544-553, in which, as an attempt to win\r\nback the Monophysites, which began even before the Conference with the\r\nSeverians in 533, three of the leading Antiochians were condemned. In\r\nconnection with the two last controversies, the Fifth General Council was\r\nheld A. D. 553.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Evagrius, _Hist. Ec._, Lib. IV-VI;\r\n    John of Ephesus, _The Third Part of His Ecclesiastical History_,\r\n    trans. by R. Payne Smith, Oxford, 1860; Percival, _Seven\r\n    Ecumenical Councils_ (PNF).\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Justinian, _Anathematisms against Origen_. Mansi, IX, 533. (MSG,\r\n86:1013; MSL, 65:221.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Origenistic controversy arose in Palestine, where the learned\r\n    monks were nicknamed Origenists by the more ignorant. The abbot\r\n    St. Sabas was especially opposed to the group which had received\r\n    this name. But several, among whom the more important were\r\n    Domitian and Theodore Askidas, won the favor of Justinian and the\r\n    latter received promotion, becoming bishop of Cæsarea in\r\n    Cappadocia. Supported by them, struggles broke out in various\r\n    places between the Sabaites and the Origenists. Ephraem, patriarch\r\n    of Antioch, in a synodal letter thereupon condemned Origenism. The\r\n    Origenists tried in vain to win the support of John, patriarch of\r\n    Constantinople. But he turned to Justinian, who thereupon\r\n    abandoned the Origenists and issued an edict condemning Origen and\r\n    his writings, and appending a summary of the positions condemned\r\n    in ten anathematisms. Text in Denziger, nn. 203 _f._ Synods were\r\n    ordered for the condemnation of Origen, and among these was the\r\n    synod under Menas, patriarch of Constantinople, in which were\r\n    issued fifteen anathematisms based upon the ten of Justinian\r\n    (Hefele, §§ 257, 258). With this action, the controversy may be\r\n    said to be closed, were it not that in spite of the renewed\r\n    condemnation at the Fifth General Council (see below) disputes and\r\n    disturbances continued in Palestine until 563.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If any one says or thinks that human souls pre-existed, that is, that\r\nthey had previously been spirits and holy powers, but that satiated with\r\nthe vision of God, they turned to evil, and in this way the divine love in\r\nthem became cold [ἀποψυγείσας] and they were there named souls [ψυχάς] and\r\nwere condemned to punishment in bodies, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n2. If any one says or thinks that the soul of the Lord pre-existed and was\r\nunited with God the Word before the incarnation and conception of the\r\nVirgin, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n3. If any one says or thinks that the body of the Lord Jesus Christ was\r\nfirst formed in the womb of the holy Virgin, and that afterward there was\r\nunited with it God the Word and the pre-existing soul, let him be\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\n4. If any one says or thinks that the Word of God has become like to all\r\nheavenly orders, so that for the cherubim He was a cherub and for the\r\nseraphim a seraph, in short, like all the superior powers, let him be\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\n5. If any one says or thinks that, at the resurrection, human bodies will\r\narise spherical in form and not like our present form, let him be\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\n6. If any one says or thinks that the heavens, the sun, moon, and stars,\r\nand the waters above the firmament have souls and are spiritual and\r\nrational beings, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n7. If any one says or thinks that Christ the Lord in a future age will be\r\ncrucified for demons as He was for men, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n8. If any one says or thinks that the power of God is limited and that He\r\ncreated only as much as He was able to comprehend, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n9. If any one says or thinks that the punishment of demons and impious men\r\nis only temporary and will have an end, and that a restoration\r\n[_apocatastasis_] will take place of demons and impious men, let him be\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\n10. Let Origen be anathema together with that Adamantius who set forth\r\nthese opinions together with his nefarious and execrable doctrine, and\r\nwhoever there is who thinks thus or defends these opinions, or in any way\r\nhereafter at any time shall presume to protect them.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Vigilius, _Judicatum_. Mansi, IX, 181.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This important document was addressed to Menas of Constantinople\r\n    and is dated April 11, 548. Unfortunately it exists only in\r\n    detached fragments, which are given below, taken from the text as\r\n    given by Hefele, § 259. The first is given in a letter of\r\n    Justinian to the Fifth Council, an abridgment of which may be\r\n    found in Hefele, § 267. Other fragments are from the _Constitutum_\r\n    (see below), where they are quoted by Vigilius from his previous\r\n    letter to Menas, which Hefele has identified with the _Judicatum_.\r\n    In this opinion Krüger (art. “Vigilius” in PRE). and Bailey (art.\r\n    “Vigilius” in DCB) and other scholars concur. The force of the\r\n    first is that the writings condemned by the Three Chapters are\r\n    heretical; of the others, that the credit of the Council of\r\n    Chalcedon must be maintained. How the two positions were\r\n    reconciled is not clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. And because certain writings under the name of Theodore of Mopsuestia\r\nhave been handed to us which contain many things contrary to the right\r\nfaith, we, following the warnings of the Apostle Paul, who said: Prove all\r\nthings, hold fast that which is good, therefore anathematize Theodore, who\r\nwas bishop of Mopsuestia, with all his impious writings, and also those\r\nwho defend him. We anathematize also the impious epistle which is said to\r\nhave been written by Ibas to Maris the Persian, as contrary to the right\r\nfaith, and also all who defend it and say that it is right. We\r\nanathematize also the writings of Theodoret which were written contrary to\r\nthe right faith and against the capitula of Cyril.(204)\r\n\r\n2. Since it is evident to us by sufficient reason, that whosoever attempts\r\nto do anything to the disparagement of the aforesaid council, will rather\r\nsin against himself.\r\n\r\n3. If it had been shown conclusively by us to be contained in the acts\r\n[_i.e._, of the Council of Chalcedon], no one would have dared to be the\r\nauthor of so great a presumption or would have regarded as doubtful or\r\nundecided anything which was brought before that most holy judgment; since\r\nit is to be believed that those then present could have investigated\r\nthings diligently even apart from writing, and have defined them\r\npositively, which appears to us after so much time and on account of\r\nunknown causes still unsettled; since also it is a part of reverence for\r\nthe synods that in those things which are less understood one recognizes\r\ntheir authority.\r\n\r\n4. All things being accepted and remaining perpetually established which\r\nwere defined in the venerable councils at Nicæa, and Constantinople, in\r\nthe first at Ephesus, and at Chalcedon, and confirmed by the authority of\r\nour predecessors; and all who in the said holy councils were deposed are\r\nwithout doubt condemned, and those are no less absolved whose absolution\r\nwas decreed by the same synods.\r\n\r\n5. Subjecting also him to the sentence of anathema who accepts as of any\r\nforce whatsoever may be found against the said synod of Chalcedon, written\r\nin this present letter, or in anything in the present case whatever done\r\nby us or by any one; and let the holy synod of Chalcedon, of which the\r\nauthority is great and unshaken, perpetual and reverenced, have the same\r\nforce as that which the synods of Nicæa, Constantinople, and the first at\r\nEphesus have.\r\n\r\n6. We anathematize also whoever does not faithfully follow and equally\r\nvenerate the holy synods of Nicæa. of Constantinople, the first of\r\nEphesus, and the synod of Chalcedon as most holy synods, agreeing in the\r\none and immaculate faith of the Apostles, and confirmed by the pontiffs of\r\nthe Apostolic See, and whoever wishes to correct as badly said, or wishes\r\nto supply as imperfect, those things which were done in the same councils\r\nwhich we have mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Vigilius, _Oath to Justinian_, August 15, A. D. 550. Mansi. IX, 363.\r\n(MSL, 69: 121.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Judicatum_ met with great opposition in the West. Vigilius,\r\n    to still the clamor against it, withdrew it and proposed other\r\n    measures in consultation with Justinian. In connection with this\r\n    he bound himself with an oath to support Justinian in putting\r\n    through the condemnation of the Three Chapters, and this oath\r\n    Justinian produced later, when Vigilius had presented his\r\n    _Constitutum_ to him refusing to condemn the chapters. The Emperor\r\n    thereupon suppressed the _Constitutum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most blessed Pope Vigilius has sworn to the most pious lord Emperor in\r\nour presence, that is of me, Theodorus, bishop of Cæsarea, in Cappadocia\r\n[see DCB, _Theodorus of Askidas_], and of me, Cethegus, the patrician, by\r\nthe sacred nails with which our Lord God Jesus Christ was crucified and by\r\nthe four holy Gospels, as also by the sacred bridle,(205) so also by the\r\nfour Gospels; that, being of one mind and will with your piety, we shall\r\nso will, attempt, and act, as far as we are able, so that the three\r\nchapters, that is, Theodore of Mopsuestia, the epistle attributed to Ibas,\r\nand the writings of Theodoret against the orthodox faith and his sayings\r\nagainst the twelve capitula of the holy Cyril, may be condemned and\r\nanathematized; and to do nothing, either by myself or by those whom we can\r\ntrust, either of the clerical or lay order, in behalf of the chapters,\r\nagainst the will of your piety, or to speak or to give counsel secretly in\r\nbehalf of those chapters. And if any one should say anything to me to the\r\ncontrary, either concerning these chapters or concerning the faith, or\r\nagainst the State, I will make him known to your piety, without peril of\r\ndeath, and also what has been said to me, so that on account of my place\r\nyou do not abandon my person; and you have promised, because I observe\r\nthese things toward your piety, to protect my honor in all respects, and\r\nalso to guard my person and reputation and to defend them with the help of\r\nGod and to protect the privileges of my see. And you have also promised\r\nthat this paper shall be shown to no one. I promise further that in the\r\ncase of the three chapters, we shall treat in common as to what ought to\r\nbe done, and whatsoever shall appear to us useful we will carry out with\r\nthe help of God. This oath was given the fifteenth day of August,\r\nindiction XIII, the twenty-third year of the reign of our lord Justinian,\r\nthe ninth year after the consulship of the illustrious Basil. I, Theodore,\r\nby the mercy of God bishop of Cæsarea, in Cappadocia, have subscribed\r\nhereunto as a witness to this oath; I, Flavius Cethegus, patrician, have\r\nsubscribed hereunto as a witness to this oath.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Vigilius, _Constitutum_, May 14, 553. (MSL, 69:67.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The synod known as the Fifth General Council met May 5, 553, and\r\n    proceeded to condemn the Three Chapters, as directed by the\r\n    Emperor. Vigilius refused to attend, but consented to pronounce\r\n    his judgment on the matter apart from the council. This he did in\r\n    his _Constitutum ad Imperatorem_, May 14, 553. In it he condemns\r\n    the teaching of Theodore of Mopsuestia, but opposes the\r\n    condemnation of Theodore himself, inasmuch as he had died in the\r\n    communion of the Church. He also opposes the condemnation of\r\n    Theodoret and Ibas, because both were acquitted at Chalcedon. This\r\n    _Constitutum_ is to be distinguished from the _Constitutum_ of 554\r\n    (MSL, 69:143, 147), in which, after the council had acceded to the\r\n    proposals of the Emperor and condemned the Three Chapters and had\r\n    excommunicated Vigilius by removing his name from the diptychs,\r\n    the latter confirmed the decisions of the council and joined in\r\n    the condemnation of the Three Chapters. For a discussion of the\r\n    whole situation, see Hefele, §§ 272-276. The devious course\r\n    followed by Vigilius has been the subject of much acrimonious\r\n    debate. The facts of the case are now generally recognized. The\r\n    conclusion of Cardinal Hergenröther, KG. I, 612, is the best that\r\n    can be said for Vigilius: “In the question as to the faith,\r\n    Vigilius was never wavering; but he was so, indeed, in the\r\n    question as to whether the action was proper or opportune, whether\r\n    it was advisable or necessary to condemn subsequently men whom the\r\n    Council of Chalcedon had spared, to put forth a judgment which\r\n    would be regarded by the Monophysites as a triumph of their cause,\r\n    which was most obnoxious for the same reason, and its supposed\r\n    dishonoring of the Council of Chalcedon, and was likely to create\r\n    new divisions instead of healing the old.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    The portions of the _Constitutum_ given below are the conclusions\r\n    of Vigilius as to each of the Three Chapters. The whole is a\r\n    lengthy document.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these things have been diligently examined, and although our Fathers\r\nspeak in different phrases yet are guided by one sentiment, that the\r\npersons of priests, who have died in the peace of the Church, should be\r\npreserved untouched; likewise the constitutions of the Apostolic See,\r\nwhich we have quoted above, uniformly define that it is lawful for no one\r\nto judge anew anything concerning the persons of the dead, but each is\r\nleft in that condition in which the last day finds him; and especially\r\nconcerning the name of Theodore of Mopsuestia, what our Fathers determined\r\nis clearly shown above. Him, therefore, we dare not condemn by our\r\nsentence, and we do not permit him to be condemned by any one else; the\r\nabove-written chapters of dogmas, which are damned by us, or any sayings\r\nof any one without name affixed, not agreeing with, or consonant with, the\r\nevangelical and apostolic doctrine and the doctrines of the four synods,\r\nof Nicæa, of Constantinople, of the first of Ephesus, and of Chalcedon,\r\nwe, however, do not suffer to be admitted to our thought or even to our\r\nears.\r\n\r\nBut concerning the writings which are brought forward under the name of\r\nthat venerable man, Theodoret, late bishop, we wonder, first, why it\r\nshould be necessary or with what desire anything should be done to the\r\ndisparagement of the name of that priest, who more than a hundred years\r\nago, in the judgement of the sacred and venerable Council of Chalcedon,\r\nsubscribed without any hesitation and consented with profound devotion to\r\nthe Epistle of the most blessed Pope Leo.… The truth of these things\r\nhaving been considered, we determine and decree that nothing be done or\r\nproposed by any one in judgement upon him to the injury and defamation of\r\na man most approved in the synod of Chalcedon, that is to say, Theodoret\r\nof Cyrus. But guarding in all respects the reverence of his person,\r\nwhatsoever writings are brought forward under his name or under that of\r\nanother evidently in accord with the errors of the wicked Nestorius and\r\nEutyches we anathematize and condemn.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Then follow these five anathematisms, the test of which may be\r\n    found in Hahn, § 228:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If any one does not confess that the Word was made flesh, and the\r\ninconvertibility of the divine nature having been preserved, and from the\r\nmoment of conception in the womb of the virgin united according to\r\nsubsistence [hypostatically] human nature to Himself, but as with a man\r\nalready existing; so that, accordingly, the holy Virgin is not to be\r\nbelieved to be truly the bearer of God, but is called so only in word, let\r\nhim be anathema.\r\n\r\n2. If any one shall deny that a unity of natures according to subsistence\r\n[hypostatically] was made in Christ, but that God the Word dwelt in a man\r\nexisting apart as one of the just, and does not confess the unity of\r\nnatures according to subsistence, that God the Word with the assumed flesh\r\nremained and remains one subsistence or person, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n3. If any one so divides the evangelical, apostolic words in reference to\r\nthe one Christ, that he introduces a division of the natures united in\r\nHim, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n4. It any one says that the one Jesus Christ, God the Word and the same\r\ntrue Son of Man, was ignorant of future things or of the day of the last\r\njudgment, and was able to know only so far as Deity revealed to Him, as if\r\ndwelling in another, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n5. If any one applies to Christ as if stripped of His divinity the saying\r\nof the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews,(206) that He knew obedience\r\nby experience and with strong crying and tears offered prayers and\r\nsupplications to God who was able to save Him from death, and who was\r\nperfected by the labors of virtue, so that from this he evidently\r\nintroduces two Christs or two Sons, and does not believe the one and the\r\nsame Christ to be confessed and adored Son of God and Son of Man, of two\r\nand in two natures inseparable and undivided, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n… We have also examined concerning the Epistle of the venerable man Ibas,\r\nonce bishop of the city of Edessa, concerning which you also ask if in\r\nearly times anything concerning it was undertaken by our Fathers, or\r\ndiscussed, or examined, or determined. Because it is known to all and\r\nespecially to your piety, that we are ignorant of the Greek language, yet\r\nby the aid of some of our company, who have knowledge of that tongue, we\r\ndiscover clearly and openly that in the same synod the affair of the\r\nvenerable man Ibas was examined, from the action taken regarding Photius,\r\nbishop of Tyre, and Eustathius, bishop of Berytus, that this epistle,\r\nconcerning which inquiry is made, was brought forward against him by his\r\naccusers; and when, after discussion of the affair was ended, it was asked\r\nof the venerable Fathers what ought to be done concerning the matter of\r\nthe same Ibas, the following sentence was passed:\r\n\r\nPaschasius and Lucentius, most reverend bishops, and Boniface, presbyter,\r\nholding the place of the Apostolic See (because the apostolic delegates\r\nare accustomed always to speak and vote first in synods), by Paschasius\r\nsaid: “Since the documents have been read, we perceive from the opinion of\r\nthe most reverend bishops that the most reverend Ibas is approved as\r\ninnocent; for now that his epistle has been read we recognize it as\r\northodox. And on this account we decree that the honor of the episcopate\r\nbe restored to him, and the church, from which unjustly and in his absence\r\nhe was driven out, be given back.” [The patriarchs of Constantinople and\r\nAntioch agreed, and their opinions are also quoted by Vigilius from the\r\nActs of the Council of Chalcedon.]\r\n\r\n… Therefore we, following in all things the discipline and judgment of the\r\nholy Fathers, and the disposition of all things according to the account\r\nwhich we have given of the judgment of the Council of Chalcedon, since it\r\nis most evidently true, from the words of the Epistle of the venerable man\r\nIbas, regarded with the right and pious mind, and from the action taken\r\nregarding Photius and Eustathius, and from the opinions of bishop Ibas,\r\ndiscussed in his presence by those present, that our Fathers present at\r\nChalcedon most justly pronounced the faith of the same venerable man Ibas\r\northodox and his blaming the blessed Cyril, which they perceive to have\r\nbeen from error of human intelligence, purged by appropriate satisfaction,\r\nby the authority of our present sentence, we determine and decree in all\r\nthings so also in the often-mentioned Epistle of the venerable Ibas, the\r\njudgment of the Fathers present at Chalcedon remain inviolate.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conclusion of the _Constitutum_:\r\n\r\n\r\nThese things having been disposed of by us in every point with all caution\r\nand diligence, in order to preserve inviolate the reverence of the said\r\nsynods and the venerable constitutions of the same; mindful that it has\r\nbeen written [_cf._ Prov. 22:26], we ought not to cross the bounds of our\r\nFathers, we determine and decree that it is permitted to no one of any\r\necclesiastical rank or dignity to do anything contrary to these things\r\nwhich, by this present constitution, we assert and determine, concerning\r\nthe oft-mentioned three chapters, or to write or to bring forward, or to\r\ncompose, or to teach, or to make any further investigation after this\r\npresent definition. But concerning the same three chapters, if anything\r\ncontrary to these things, which we here determine and assert, is made in\r\nthe name of any one, in ecclesiastical order or dignity, or shall be found\r\nby any one or anywheresoever, such a one by the authority of the Apostolic\r\nSee, in which by the grace of God we are placed, we refute in every way.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Council of Constantinople, A. D. 553, _Definition_. Mansi, IX, 367.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Condemnation of the Three Chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This action is taken from the Definition of the council, a rather\r\n    wordy document, but ending with a passage indicating the action of\r\n    the council. From this concluding passage this condemnation is\r\n    taken. See Hefele, § 274, also PNF, ser. II, vol. XIV, pp.\r\n    306-311.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe condemn and anathematize with all other heretics who have been\r\ncondemned and anathematized by the before-mentioned four holy synods, and\r\nby the Catholic and Apostolic Church, Theodore, who was bishop of\r\nMopsuestia, and his impious writings, and also those things which\r\nTheodoret impiously wrote against the right faith and against the twelve\r\ncapitula of the holy Cyril, and against the first synod of Ephesus, and\r\nalso those which he wrote in defence of Theodore and Nestorius. In\r\naddition to these, we also anathematize the impious epistle which Ibas is\r\nsaid to have written to Maris the Persian, which denies that God the Word\r\nwas incarnate of the holy Theotokos and ever-virgin Mary, and accuses\r\nCyril, of holy memory, who taught the truth, of being a heretic and of the\r\nsame sentiments with Apollinaris, and blames the first synod of Ephesus\r\nfor deposing Nestorius without examination and inquiry, and calls the\r\ntwelve capitula of Cyril impious and contrary to the right faith, and\r\ndefends Theodore and Nestorius, and their impious dogmas and writings. We,\r\ntherefore, anathematize the three chapters before mentioned, that is the\r\nimpious Theodore of Mopsuestia with his execrable writings, and those\r\nthings which Theodoret impiously wrote, and the impious letter which is\r\nsaid to be by Ibas, together with their defenders and those who have\r\nwritten or do write in defence of them, or who dare to say that they are\r\ncorrect, and who have defended or do attempt to defend their impiety with\r\nthe names of the holy Fathers or of the holy Council of Chalcedon.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Council of Constantinople A. D. 553. _Anathematism_ 11. Mansi, IX,\r\n201. _Cf._ Denziger. n. 223.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Condemnation of Origen.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Appended to the Definition of the council are fourteen\r\n    anathematisms, forming (1-10) an exposition of the doctrine of the\r\n    two natures, and concluding with condemnation of Origen, together\r\n    with other heretics, and of the Three Chapters (11-14). These\r\n    anathematisms are based upon a confession of faith of the Emperor\r\n    Justinian, a lengthy document, but containing thirteen\r\n    anathematisms. This confession of faith was composed before the\r\n    council, probably in 551. For an analysis of it, see Hefele, §\r\n    263. The text of the council’s anathematisms may be found in\r\n    Hefele, § 274, also in Hahn, § 148. Attempts have been made by\r\n    older scholars to show that the name Origen was a later insertion.\r\n    For arguments, see Hefele, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one does not anathematize Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius, Apollinaris,\r\nNestorius, Eutyches, and Origen, with their impious writings, as also all\r\nother heretics already condemned and anathematized by the holy Catholic\r\nand Apostolic Church, and by the aforesaid four holy synods, and all those\r\nwho have been or are of the same mind with the heretics mentioned, and who\r\nremain to the end in their impiety, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 94. The Byzantine State Church under Justinian\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Justinian’s scheme of Church government, the Emperor was the\r\nhead of the Church in the sense that he had the right and duty of\r\nregulating by his laws the minutest detail of worship and discipline, and\r\nalso of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church. This\r\nis shown, not merely in his conduct of the Fifth General Council, but also\r\nin his attempt, at the end of his life, to force Aphthartodocetism upon\r\nthe Church. This position of the Emperor in relation to the Church is\r\nknown as Cæsaropapism. (See Bury, _Later Roman Empire_, chap. XI.) The\r\necclesiastical legislation of Justinian should also be considered. At the\r\nsame time Justinian strictly repressed the lingering heathenism and, in\r\nthe interest of the schools at Constantinople, closed the schools at\r\nAthens, the last stronghold of paganism.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Evagrius, _Hist. Ec._, IV, 39. (MSG, 86 II:2781.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aphthartodocetism of Justinian.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Among the many variations of Monophysitism flourishing under\r\n    Justinian was Aphthartodocetism, according to which the body of\r\n    Christ, before as well as after his resurrection, was “a glorified\r\n    body,” or incapable of suffering. See selection for description.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time Justinian, abandoning the right road of doctrine and\r\nfollowing the path untrodden by the Apostles and Fathers, became entangled\r\nin thorns and briars; and he attempted to fill the Church also with these,\r\nbut failed in his purpose, and thereby fulfilled the prediction of\r\nprophecy.… Justinian, after he had anathematized Origen, Didymus, and\r\nEvagrius, issued what the Latins call an edict, after the deposition of\r\nEustochius [A. D. 556], in which he termed the body of the Lord\r\nincorruptible and incapable of the natural and blameless passions;\r\naffirming that the Lord ate before His passion in the same manner as after\r\nHis resurrection, His holy body having undergone no conversion or change\r\nfrom the time of its actual formation in the womb, not even in respect to\r\nthe natural and voluntary passions, nor yet after the resurrection. To\r\nthis he proceeded to compel bishops in all parts to give their assent.\r\nHowever, they all professed to look to Anastasius, the Bishop of Antioch,\r\nand thus avoided the first attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Justinian, _Novella VI_ “Preface.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    Church and State according to Justinian.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the greatest gifts of God bestowed by the kindness of heaven are the\r\npriesthood and the imperial dignity. Of these the former serves things\r\ndivine; the latter rules human affairs and cares for them. Both are\r\nderived from the one and the same source, and order human life. And,\r\ntherefore, nothing is so much a care to the emperors as the dignity of the\r\npriesthood; so that they may always pray to God for them. For if one is in\r\nevery respect blameless and filled with confidence toward God, and the\r\nother rightly and properly maintains in order the commonwealth intrusted\r\nto it, there is a certain excellent harmony which furnishes whatsoever is\r\nneedful for the human race. We, therefore, have the greatest cares for the\r\ntrue doctrines of God and the dignity of the priesthood which, if they\r\npreserve it, we trust that by it great benefits will be bestowed by God,\r\nand we shall possess undisturbed those things which we have, and in\r\naddition acquire those things which we have not yet acquired. But all\r\nthings are well and properly carried on, if only a proper beginning is\r\nlaid, and one that is acceptable to God. But this we believe will be so if\r\nthe observance of the sacred canons is cared for, which also the Apostles,\r\nwho are rightly to be praised, and the venerated eye-witnesses and\r\nministers of the word of God, delivered, and which the holy Fathers have\r\nalso preserved and explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Justinian, _Novella CXXXVII_, 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following section from the conclusion of a _novella_\r\n    illustrates the manner in which Justinian legislated in matter of\r\n    internal affairs for the Church and instituted a control over the\r\n    priesthood which was other than that of the Church’s own system of\r\n    discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe command that all bishops and presbyters shall offer the sacred oblation\r\nand the prayers in holy baptism not silently, but with a voice which may\r\nbe heard by the faithful people, that thereby the minds of those listening\r\nmay be moved to greater contrition and to the glory of God. For so,\r\nindeed, the holy Apostle teaches (I Cor. 14:16; Rom. 10:10).… Therefore it\r\nis right that to our Lord Jesus Christ, to our God with the Father and the\r\nHoly Ghost, be offered prayer in the holy oblation and other prayers with\r\nthe voice by the most holy bishops and the presbyters; for the holy\r\npriests should know that if they neglect any of those things they shall\r\nrender an account at the terrible judgment of the great God and our\r\nSaviour Jesus Christ, and that we shall not quietly permit such things\r\nwhen we know of them and will not leave them unpunished. We command,\r\ntherefore, that the governors of the epachies, if they see anything\r\nneglected of those things which have been decreed by us, first urge the\r\nmetropolitans and other bishops to celebrate the aforesaid synods, and do\r\nwhatsoever things we have ordered by this present law concerning synods,\r\nand, if they see them delaying, let them report to us, that from us may\r\ncome a proper correction of those who put off holding synods. And the\r\ngovernors and the officials subject to them should know that if they do\r\nnot observe these matters they will be liable to the extreme penalty\r\n[_i.e._, death]. But we confirm by this present law all things which have\r\nbeen decreed by us in various constitutions concerning bishops,\r\npresbyters, and other clerics, and further concerning lodging-places for\r\nstrangers, poor-houses, orphan asylums and others as many as are over the\r\nsacred buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Justinian, _Novella CXXIII_, 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Laws governing the ordination of bishops.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe decree that whenever it is necessary to ordain a bishop, the clergy and\r\nthe leading citizens whose is the bishop who is to be ordained shall make,\r\nunder peril of their souls, with the holy Gospels placed before them,\r\ncertificates concerning three persons, testifying in the same certificates\r\nthat they have not chosen them for any gifts or promises or for reasons of\r\nfriendship, or any other cause, but because they know that they are of the\r\ntrue and Catholic faith and of honest life, and learned in science and\r\nthat none of them has either wife or children, and know that they have\r\nneither concubine nor natural children, but that if any of them had a wife\r\nthe same was one and first, neither a widow nor separated from her\r\nhusband, nor prohibited by the laws and sacred canons; and know that they\r\nare not a curial or an official, or, in case they should be such, are not\r\nliable to any curial or official duty; and they know that they have in\r\nsuch case spent not less than fifteen years in a monastery. This also is\r\nto be contained in the certificate: that they know the person selected by\r\nthem to be not less than thirty years of age; so that from the three\r\npersons for whom these certificates were made the best may be ordained by\r\nthe choice and at the peril of him who ordains. But a curial or an\r\nofficial who, as has been said, has lived fifteen years in a monastery and\r\nis advanced to the episcopate is freed from his rank so that as freed from\r\nthe curia he may retain a fourth part of his property, since the rest of\r\nhis property, according to our law, is to be claimed by the curia and\r\nfisc. Also we give to those who make the certificate the privilege that if\r\nthey deem a layman, with the exception of a curial or an official, worthy\r\nof the said election, they may choose such layman with the two other\r\nclergy or monks, but so, however, that the layman who has in this way been\r\nchosen to the episcopate shall not be ordained at once, but shall first be\r\nnumbered among the clergy not less than three months, and so having\r\nlearned the holy canons and the sacred ministry of the Church, he shall be\r\nordained bishop; for he who ought to teach others ought not himself to be\r\ntaught by others after his consecration. But if by chance there are not\r\nfound in any place three persons eligible to such election, it is\r\npermitted those who make the certificates to make them for two or even for\r\nonly one person, who shall each have the testimonials mentioned by us. But\r\nif those who ought to elect a bishop do not make this certificate within\r\nsix months, then, at the peril of his soul, let him who ought to ordain\r\nordain a bishop, provided, however, that all things which we have said be\r\nobserved. But if any one is made bishop contrary to the aforesaid rules,\r\nwe command that he be driven entirely from the episcopate; but as for him\r\nwho dared to ordain him against these commands, let him be separated from\r\nthe sacred ministry for a year and all his property, which at any time or\r\nin any way shall come into his possession, shall be seized on account of\r\nthe crime he has committed against the rule of the Church of which he was\r\na bishop.\r\n\r\nCh. 13. We do not permit clergy to be ordained unless they are educated,\r\nhave the right faith, and an honorable life, and neither have, nor have\r\nhad, a concubine or natural children, but who either live chastely or have\r\na lawful wife and her one and only, neither a widow not separated from her\r\nhusband, nor forbidden by laws and sacred canons.\r\n\r\nCh. 14. We do not permit presbyters to be made less than thirty years old,\r\ndeacons and sub-deacons less than twenty-five, and lectors less than\r\nsixteen; nor a deaconess to be ordained(207) in the holy Church who is\r\nless than forty years old and who has been married a second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Justinian, _Codex_, I, 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Law against paganism.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following laws of Justinian, though of uncertain date, mark\r\n    the termination of the contest between Christianity and paganism.\r\n    In the second of these laws there is a reference to the\r\n    prohibition of pagan teachers. It is in line with the closing of\r\n    the schools of the heathen teachers at Athens. The decree closing\r\n    the schools has not been preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 9. We command that our magistrates in this royal city and in the\r\nprovinces take care with the greatest zeal that, having been informed by\r\nthemselves or the most religious bishops of this matter, they make inquiry\r\naccording to law into all impurities of pagan(208) superstitions, that\r\nthey be not committed, and if committed that they be punished; but if\r\ntheir repression exceed provincial power, these things are to be referred\r\nto us, that the responsibility for, and incitement of, these crimes may\r\nnot rest upon them.\r\n\r\n(1) It is permitted no one, either in testament or by gift, to leave or\r\ngive anything to persons or places for the maintenance of pagan impiety,\r\neven if it is not expressly contained in the words of the will, testament,\r\nor donation, but can be truly perceived in some other way by the judges.\r\n(2) But those things which are so left or given shall be taken from the\r\npersons and places to whom they have been given or left, and shall belong\r\nto the cities in which such persons dwell or in which such places are\r\nsituated, so that they may be paid as a form of revenue. (3) All penalties\r\nwhich have been introduced by previous emperors against the errors of\r\npagans or in favor of the orthodox faith are to remain in force and effect\r\nforever and guarded by this present pious legislation.\r\n\r\nCh. 10. Because some are found who are imbued with the error of the\r\nimpious and detestable pagans, and do those things which move a merciful\r\nGod to just wrath, and that we may not suffer ourselves to leave\r\nuncorrected matters which concern these things, but, knowing that they\r\nhave abandoned the worship of the true and only God, and have in insane\r\nerror offered sacrifices, and, filled with all impiety, have celebrated\r\nsolemnities, we subject those who have committed these things, after they\r\nhave been held worthy of holy baptism, to the punishment appropriate to\r\nthe crimes of which they have been convicted; but for the future we decree\r\nto all by this present law that they who have been made Christians and at\r\nany time have been deemed worthy of the holy and saving baptism, if it\r\nappear that they have remained still in the error of the pagans, shall\r\nsuffer capital punishment.\r\n\r\n(1) Those who have not yet been worthy of the venerable rite of baptism\r\nshall report themselves, if they dwell in this royal city or in the\r\nprovinces, and go to the holy churches with their wives and children and\r\nall the household subject to them, and be taught the true faith of\r\nChristians, so that having been taught their former error henceforth to be\r\nrejected, they may receive saving baptism, or know, if they regard these\r\nthings of small value, that they are to have no part in all those things\r\nwhich belong to our commonwealth, neither is it permitted them to become\r\nowners of anything movable or immovable, but, deprived of everything, they\r\nare to be left in poverty, and besides are subject to appropriate\r\npenalties.\r\n\r\n(2) We forbid also that any branch of learning be taught by those who\r\nlabor under the insanity of the impious pagans, so that they may not for\r\nthis reason pretend that they instruct those who unfortunately resort to\r\nthem, but in reality corrupt the minds of their pupils; and let them not\r\nreceive any support from the public treasury, since they are not permitted\r\nby the Holy Scriptures or by pragmatic forms [public decrees] to claim\r\nanything of the sort for themselves.\r\n\r\n(3) For if any one here or in the provinces shall have been convicted of\r\nnot having hastened to the holy churches with his wife and children, as\r\nsaid, he shall suffer the aforesaid penalties, and the fisc shall claim\r\nhis property, and they shall be sent into exile.\r\n\r\n(4) If any one in our commonwealth, hiding himself, shall be discovered to\r\nhave celebrated sacrifices or the worship of idols, let him suffer the\r\nsame capital punishment as the Manichæans and, what is the same, the\r\nBorborani [certain Ophitic Gnostics; _cf._ DCB], for we judge them to be\r\nsimilar to these.\r\n\r\n(5) Also we decree that their children of tender years shall at once and\r\nwithout delay receive saving baptism; but they who have passed beyond\r\ntheir earliest age shall attend the holy churches and be instructed in the\r\nHoly Scriptures, and so give themselves to sincere penitence that, having\r\nrejected their early error, they may receive the venerable rite of\r\nbaptism, for in this way let them steadfastly receive the true faith of\r\nthe orthodox and not again fall back into their former error.\r\n\r\n(6) But those who, for the sake of retaining their military rank or their\r\ndignity or their goods, shall in pretence accept saving baptism, but have\r\nleft their wives and children and others who are in their households in\r\nthe error of pagans, we command that they be deprived of their goods and\r\nhave no part in our commonwealth, since it is manifest that they have not\r\nreceived holy baptism in good faith.\r\n\r\n(7) These things, therefore, we decree against the abominable pagans and\r\nthe Manichæans, of which Manichæans the Borborani are a part.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 95. The Definitive Type of Religion in the East: Dionysius the\r\nAreopagite\r\n\r\n\r\nThe works of Dionysius the Areopagite first appear in the controversies in\r\nthe reign of Justinian, when they are quoted in the Conference with the\r\nSeverians, 531 or 533. There are citations from the works of the\r\nAreopagite fifteen or twenty years earlier in the works of Severus, the\r\nMonophysite patriarch of Antioch. In this is given the latest date to\r\nwhich they may be assigned. They cannot be earlier than 476, because the\r\nauthor is acquainted with the works of Proclus (411-485) and uses them;\r\nalso he refers to the practice of singing the Credo in divine service,\r\nwhich was first introduced by the Monophysites at Antioch in 476. No\r\ncloser determination of the date is possible. The author is wholly\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThat he was Dionysius the Areopagite (Acts 17:34) is maintained by no\r\nscholar to-day. His standpoint is that of the later Eastern religious\r\nfeeling and practice, with its strong desire for mysteries and sacramental\r\nsystem. But he brings to it Neo-Platonic thought to such a degree as to\r\ncolor completely his presentation of Christian truth. The effect of the\r\nbook was only gradual, but eventually very great. In the East it gave\r\nauthority, which seemed to be that of the apostolic age, for its highly\r\ndeveloped system of mysteries, which had grown up in the Church. In the\r\nWest it served as a philosophical basis for scholastic mysticism. On\r\naccount of the connection between Dionysius and the later Greek philosophy\r\nand the mediæval philosophy, Dionysius the Areopagite occupies a place in\r\nthe histories of philosophy quite out of proportion to the intrinsic merit\r\nof the writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: English translations of Dionysius the\r\n    Areopagite, Dean Colet, ed. by J. H. Lupton, London, 1869, and J.\r\n    Parker, Oxford, 1897 (not complete); a new translation into German\r\n    appeared in the new edition of the _Kempten Bibliothek der\r\n    Kirchenväter_, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Dionysius Areopagita, _De Cælesti Hierarchia_, III, 2. (MSG, 3:165.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dionysius thus defines “Hierarchy”:\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who speaks of a hierarchy indicates thereby a holy order … which in a\r\nholy manner works the mysteries of illumination which is appropriate to\r\neach one. The order of the hierarchy consists in this, that some are\r\npurified and others purify; some are illuminated and others illuminate;\r\nsome are completed and others complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _De Cælesti Hierarchia_, VI, 2. (MSG, 3:200.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The heavenly hierarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheology has given to all heavenly existences new explanatory titles. Our\r\ndivine initiator divides these into three threefold ranks. The first is\r\nthat, as he says, which is ever about God, and which, as it is related\r\n(Ezek. 1), is permanently and before all others immediately united to Him;\r\nfor the explanation of the Holy Scripture tells us that the most holy\r\nthrone and the many-eyed and many-winged ranks, which in Hebrew are called\r\ncherubim and seraphim, stand before God in the closest proximity. This\r\nthreefold order, or rank, our great leader names the one, like, and only\r\ntruly first hierarchy, which is more godlike and stands more immediately\r\nnear the first effects of the illuminations of divinity than all others.\r\nAs the second hierarchy, he names that which is composed of authorities,\r\ndominions, and powers, and as the third and last of the heavenly\r\nhierarchies he names the order of angels, archangels, and principalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _De Ecclesiastica Hierarchia_, I, 1. (MSG, 3:372.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The nature of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat our hierarchy … which is given by God, is God-inspired and divine, a\r\ndivinely acting knowledge, activity, and completion, we must show from the\r\nsupernal and most Holy Scriptures to those who through hierarchical\r\nsecrets and traditions have been initiated into the holy consecration.…\r\nJesus, the most divine and most transcendent spirit, the principle and the\r\nbeing and the most divine power of every hierarchy, holiness, and divine\r\noperation, brings to the blessed beings superior to us a more bright and\r\nat the same time more spiritual light and makes them as far as possible\r\nlike to His own light. And through our love which tends upward toward Him,\r\nby the love of the beautiful which draws us up to Him, He brings together\r\ninto one our many heterogeneities; that He might perfect them so as to\r\nbecome a uniform and divine life, condition, and activity, He gives us the\r\npower of the divine priesthood. In consequence of this honor we arrive at\r\nthe holy activity of the priesthood, and so we ourselves come near to the\r\nbeings over us, that we, so far as we are able, approximate to their\r\nabiding and unchangeable holy state and so look up to the blessed and\r\ndivine brilliancy of Jesus, gaze religiously on what is attainable by us\r\nto see, and are illuminated by the knowledge of what is seen; and thus we\r\nare initiated into the mystic science, and, initiating, we can become\r\nlight-like and divinely working, complete and completing.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _De Ecclesiastica Hierarchia_, V, 3. (MSG, 3:504.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most holy consecration of initiation has as the godlike power or\r\nactivity the expiatory purification of the imperfect, as the second the\r\nilluminating consecration of the purified, and as the last, which also\r\nincludes the other two, the perfecting of the consecrated in the knowledge\r\nof the consecrations that belong to them.…\r\n\r\n5. The divine order of the hierarch(209) is the first under the\r\nGod-beholding orders; it is the highest and also the last, for in it every\r\nother order of our hierarchy ends and is completed.(210) For we see that\r\nevery hierarchy ends in Jesus, and so each one ends in the God-filled\r\nhierarchs.\r\n\r\n6. The hierarchical order, which is filled full of the perfecting power,\r\nperforms especially the consecrations of the hierarchy, imparts by\r\nrevelation the knowledge of the sacred things, and teaches the conditions\r\nand powers appropriate to them. The order of priests which leads to light\r\nleads to the divine beholding of the sacred mysteries all those who have\r\nbeen initiated by the divine order of the hierarchs and with that order\r\nperforms its proper sacred functions. In what it does it displays the\r\ndivine working through the most holy symbols [_i.e._, sacraments] and\r\nmakes those who approach beholders and participants in the most holy\r\nmysteries, sending on to the hierarch those who desire the knowledge of\r\nthose sacred rites which are seen. The order of the liturges [or deacons]\r\nis that which cleanses and separates the unlike before they come to the\r\nsacred rites of the priests, purifies those who approach that it may\r\nrender them pure from all that is opposing and unworthy of beholding and\r\nparticipating in the sacred mysteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) _De Ecclesiastica Hierarchia_, I, 3. (MSG, 3:373.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sacraments.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The mysteries or sacraments, according to Dionysius the\r\n    Areopagite, are six in number: baptism, the eucharist, anointing\r\n    or confirmation, the consecration of priests, the consecration of\r\n    monks,(211) and the consecration of the dead. These he discusses\r\n    in chs. 2-7 of the _Ecclesiastical Hierarchy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalvation can in no other way come about than that the saved are deified.\r\nThe deification is the highest possible resemblance to God and union with\r\nHim. The common aim of all the hierarchy is the love which hangs upon God\r\nand things divine, which fills with a divine spirit and works in godlike\r\nfashion; and before this is the complete and never retreating flight from\r\nthat which is opposed to it, the knowledge of being as being, the vision\r\nand knowledge of the holy truth, the divinely inspired participation in\r\nthe homogeneous perfection of the One himself, so far as man can come to\r\nthat, the enjoyment of the holy contemplation, which spiritually nourishes\r\nand deifies every one who strives for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. The Transition To The Middle Ages. The Foundation Of The\r\nGermanic National Churches\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the doctrinal system of the Church was being wrought out in the\r\ndisputes and councils of Rome and the East, the foundations of the\r\nGermanic national churches were being laid in the West. In the British\r\nIsles the faith was extended from Britain to Ireland and thence to\r\nScotland (§ 96). Among the inmates of the monasteries of these countries\r\nwere many monks who were moved to undertake missionary journeys to various\r\nparts of Western Europe, and among them St. Columbanus. But even more\r\nimportant for the future of Western Christendom was the conversion of the\r\nFranks from paganism to Catholic Christianity. At a time when the other\r\nGermanic rulers were still Arian, Clovis and the Franks became Catholics\r\nand, as a consequence, the champions of the Catholic faith. The Franks\r\nrapidly became the dominant power in the West, and soon other Germanic\r\nraces either were conquered or followed the example of the Franks and\r\nbecame Catholics (§ 97). The State churches that thus arose were more\r\nunder the control of the local royal authority than the Catholic Church\r\nhad previously been, and the rulers were little disposed to favor outside\r\ncontrol of the ecclesiastical affairs of their kingdoms (§ 98). Toward the\r\nend of the sixth century the greatest pontiff of the ancient Church,\r\nGregory the Great, more than recovered the prestige and influence which\r\nhad been lost under Vigilius. By his able administration he did much to\r\nunite the West, to heal the schism resulting from the Fifth Council, and\r\nto overcome the heresies which divided the Arians and the Catholics. At\r\nthe same time he advanced the authority of the see of Rome in the East as\r\nwell as in the West (§ 99). Of the many statesman-like undertakings of\r\nGregory none had more far-reaching consequences than the conversion of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons and the establishment in England of a church which would be\r\nin close and loyal dependence upon the Roman see, and in consequence of\r\nthat close connection would be the heir of the best traditions of culture\r\nin the West (§ 100).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 96. The Celtic Church in the British Isles\r\n\r\n\r\nChristianity was probably planted in the British Isles during the second\r\ncentury; as to its growth in the ante-Nicene period little is definitely\r\nknown. Representatives of the British Church were at Arles in 314. The\r\nChurch was in close connection with the Church on the Continent during the\r\nfourth century and in the fifth during the Pelagian controversy. The\r\nChristianity thus established was completely overthrown or driven into\r\nWales by the invasion of the pagan Angles, Jutes, and Saxons _circa_\r\n449-500. (For the conversion of the newcomers, _v. infra_, § 100.) Early\r\nin the fifth century the conversion of Ireland took place by missionaries\r\nfrom Britain. In this conversion St. Patrick traditionally plays an\r\nimportant part.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Bede, _Hist. Ec._, Eng. trans. by\r\n    Giles, London, 1894; by A. M.

His work becomes of independent value with\r\n    the account of the coming of Augustine of Canterbury, 597 (I, 23).\r\n    The history extends to A. D. 731.

B. Bury, _The Life of\r\n    St. Patrick __ and his Place in History_, 1905.

In the eighth year of his reign,\r\nPalladius was sent by Celestinus, the pontiff of the Roman Church, to the\r\nScots(212) that believed in Christ to be their first bishop. In the\r\ntwenty-third year of his reign (446), Aëtius, the illustrious, who was\r\nalso patrician, discharged his third consulate with Symmachus as his\r\ncolleague. To him the wretched remnants of the Britons sent a letter\r\nbeginning: “To Aëtius, thrice consul, the groans of the Britons.” And in\r\nthe course of the letter they thus express their calamities: “The\r\nbarbarians drive us to the sea; the sea drives us back to the barbarians;\r\nbetween them there have arisen two sorts of death; we are either slain or\r\ndrowned.” Yet neither could all this procure any assistance from him, as\r\nhe was then engaged in a most dangerous war with Blæda and Attila, kings\r\nof the Huns. And though the year next before this, Blæda had been murdered\r\nby the treachery of his brother Attila, yet Attila himself remained so\r\nintolerable an enemy to the republic that he ravaged almost all Europe,\r\ninvading and destroying cities and castles.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Patrick, _Confessio_, chs. 1, 10. (MSL, 53:801.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The call of St. Patrick to be a missionary.\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is much dispute and uncertainty about the life and work of\r\n    St. Patrick. Of the works of Patrick, two appear to be genuine,\r\n    his _Confessio_ and his _Epistola ad Coroticum_. The other works\r\n    attributed to him are very probably spurious. The genuine works\r\n    may be found in Haddan and Stubbs, _Councils and Ecclesiastical\r\n    Documents relating to Great Britain and Ireland_, vol. II, pt. ii,\r\n    296 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\nI, Patrick, a sinner, the most ignorant and least of all the faithful, and\r\nthe most contemptible among many, had for my father Calpornius the deacon,\r\nson of the presbyter Potitus, the son of Odissus, who was of the village\r\nof Bannavis Tabernia; he had near by a little estate where I was taken\r\ncaptive. I was then nearly sixteen years old. But I was ignorant of the\r\ntrue God(213) and I was taken into captivity unto Ireland, with so many\r\nthousand men, according to our deserts, because we had forsaken God and\r\nnot kept His commandments and had not been obedient to our priests who\r\nwarned us of our salvation. And the Lord brought upon us the fury of His\r\nwrath and scattered us among many nations, even to the end of the earth,\r\nwhere now my meanness appears to be among strangers. And there the Lord\r\nopened the senses of my unbelief, that I might remember my sin, and that I\r\nmight be converted with my whole heart to my Lord God, who looked upon my\r\nhumbleness and had mercy upon my youth and ignorance, and guarded me\r\nbefore I knew Him, and before I knew and distinguished between good and\r\nevil, and protected me and comforted me as a father a son.\r\n\r\n… And again after a few years(214) I was with my relatives in Britain, who\r\nreceived me as a son, and earnestly besought me that I should never leave\r\nthem after having endured so many great tribulations. And there I saw in a\r\nvision by night a man coming to me as from Ireland, and his name was\r\nVictorinus, and he had innumerable epistles; and he gave me one of them\r\nand I read the beginning of the epistle as follows: “The voice of the\r\nIrish.” And while I was reading the epistle, I think that it was at the\r\nvery moment, I heard the voice of those who were near the wood of\r\nFochlad,(215) which is near the Western Sea. And thus they cried out with\r\none voice: We beseech thee, holy youth, to come here and dwell among us.\r\nAnd I was greatly smitten in heart, and could read no further and so I\r\nawoke. Thanks be to God, because after many years the Lord granted them\r\naccording to their cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Bede, _Hist. Ec._, III, 4. (MSL, 95:121.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    St. Ninian and St. Columba in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 565, when Justin the younger, the successor of\r\nJustinian, took the government of the Roman Empire, there came into\r\nBritain a priest and abbot, distinguished in habit and monastic life,\r\nColumba by name, to preach the word of God to the provinces of the\r\nnorthern Picts, that is, to those who are separated from the southern\r\nparts by steep and rugged mountains. For the southern Picts, who had their\r\nhomes within those mountains, had long before, as is reported, forsaken\r\nthe error of idolatry, and embraced the true faith, by the preaching of\r\nthe word to them by Ninian,(216) a most reverend bishop and holy man of\r\nthe British nation, who had been regularly instructed at Rome in the faith\r\nand mysteries of the truth, whose episcopal see was named after St.\r\nMartin, the bishop, and was famous for its church, wherein he and many\r\nother saints rest in the body, and which the English nation still\r\npossesses. The place belongs to the province of Bernicia, and is commonly\r\ncalled Candida Casa,(217) because he there built a church of stone, which\r\nwas not usual among the Britons.\r\n\r\nColumba came to Britain in the ninth year of the reign of Bridius, the son\r\nof Meilochon, the very powerful king of the Picts, and he converted by\r\nwork and example that nation to the faith of Christ; whereupon he also\r\nreceived the aforesaid island [Iona] for a monastery. It is not large, but\r\ncontains about five families, according to English reckoning. His\r\nsuccessors hold it to this day, and there also he was buried, when he was\r\nseventy-seven, about thirty-two years after he came into Britain to\r\npreach. Before he came into Britain he had built a noble monastery in\r\nIreland, which from the great number of oaks is called in the Scottish\r\ntongue(218) Dearmach, that is, the Field of Oaks. From both of these\r\nmonasteries many others had their origin through his disciples both in\r\nBritain and Ireland; but the island monastery where his body lies holds\r\nthe rule.\r\n\r\nThat island always has for its ruler an abbot, who is a priest, to whose\r\ndirection all the province and even bishops themselves are subject by an\r\nunusual form of organization, according to the example of their first\r\nteacher, who was not a bishop, but a priest and monk; of whose life and\r\ndiscourses some writings are said to have been preserved by his disciples.\r\nBut whatever he was himself, this we regard as certain concerning him,\r\nthat he left successors renowned for their great continency, their love of\r\nGod, and their monastic rules. However, they followed uncertain\r\ncycles(219) in their observance of the great festival [Easter], for no one\r\nbrought them the synodal decrees for the observance of Easter, because\r\nthey were placed so far away from the rest of the world; they only\r\npractised such works of piety and chastity as they could learn from the\r\nprophetical, evangelical, and apostolical writings. This manner of keeping\r\nEaster continued among them for a long time, that is, for the space of one\r\nhundred and fifty years, or until the year of our Lord’s incarnation 715.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 97. The Conversion of the Franks. The Establishment of Catholicism in\r\nthe Germanic Kingdoms\r\n\r\n\r\nChlodowech (Clovis, 481-511) was originally a king of the Salian Franks,\r\nnear Tournay. By his energy he became king of all the Franks, and,\r\noverthrowing Syagrius in 486, pushed his frontier to the Loire. In 496 he\r\nconquered a portion of the Alemanni. About this time he became a Catholic.\r\nHe had for some time favored the Catholic religion, and with his\r\nconversion his rule was associated with that cause in the kingdoms subject\r\nto Arian rulers. In this way his support of Catholicism was in line with\r\nhis policy of conquest. By constant warfare Chlodowech was able to push\r\nhis frontier, in 507, to the Garonne. His death, in 511, at less than\r\nfifty years of age, cut short only for a time the extension of the\r\nFrankish kingdom. Under his sons, Burgundy, Thuringia, and Bavaria were\r\nconquered. The kingdom, which had been divided on the death of Chlodowech,\r\nwas united under the youngest son, Chlotar I (sole ruler 558-561), again\r\ndivided on his death, to be united under Chlotar II (sole ruler 613-628).\r\nIn Spain the Suevi, in the northwest, became Catholic under Carrarich in\r\n550. They were conquered in 585 by the Visigoths, who in turn became\r\nCatholic in 589.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Gregory of Tours, _Historia Francorum_, II, 30. 31. (MSL, 71:225.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gregory of Tours (538-593) became bishop of Tours in 573. Placed\r\n    in this way in the most important see of France, he was constantly\r\n    thrown in contact with the Merovingian royal family and had\r\n    abundant opportunity to become acquainted with the course of\r\n    events at first hand. His most important work, the _History of the\r\n    Franks_, is especially valuable from the fifth book on, as here he\r\n    is on ground with which he was personally familiar. In Book II,\r\n    from which the selection is taken, Gregory depends upon others,\r\n    and must be used with caution.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The baptism of Chlodowech was probably the result of a long\r\n    process of deliberation, beginning probably before his marriage\r\n    with Chrotechildis, a Burgundian princess, who was a Catholic.\r\n    While still a pagan he was favorably disposed toward the Catholic\r\n    Church. About 496 he was baptized, probably on Christmas Day, at\r\n    Rheims, by St. Remigius. The place and date have been much\r\n    disputed of late. The earliest references to the conversion are by\r\n    Nicetus of Trier (_ob. circa_ 566), _Epistula ad Chlodosvindam\r\n    reginam Longobardorum_ (MSL, 5:375); and Avitus, _Epistula_ 41,\r\n    addressed to Chlodowech himself. (MSL, 59:257). A careful\r\n    examination of all the evidence may be found in A. Hauck,\r\n    _Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands_, fourth ed., I, 595 _ff._ Hauck\r\n    concludes that “the date, December 25, 496, may be regarded as\r\n    almost certainly the date of the baptism of Chlodowech. The\r\n    connection as to time between the first war with the Alemanni and\r\n    the baptism may have given occasion to seek for some actual\r\n    connection between the two events.” The selection is therefore\r\n    given as the traditional version and is not to be relied upon as\r\n    correct in detail. It represents what was probably the current\r\n    belief within a few decades of the event.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 30. The queen (Chrotechildis) ceased not to warn Chlodowech that he\r\nshould acknowledge the true God and forsake idols. But in no way could he\r\nbe brought to believe these things. Finally war broke out with the\r\nAlemanni. Then by necessity was he compelled to acknowledge what before he\r\nhad denied with his will. The two armies met and there was a fearful\r\nslaughter, and the army of Chlodowech was on the point of being\r\nannihilated. When the king perceived that, he raised his eyes to heaven,\r\nhis heart was smitten and he was moved to tears, and he said: “Jesus\r\nChrist, whom Chrotechildis declares to be the Son of the living God, who\r\nsays that Thou wilt help those in need and give victory to those who hope\r\nin Thee, humbly I flee to Thee for Thy mighty aid, that Thou wilt give me\r\nvictory over these my enemies, and I will in this way experience Thy\r\npower, which the people called by Thy name claim that they have proved to\r\nbe in Thee. Then will I believe on Thee and be baptized in Thy name. For I\r\nhave called upon my gods but, as I have seen, they are far from my help.\r\nTherefore, I believe that they have no power who do not hasten to aid\r\nthose obedient to them. I now call upon Thee and I desire to believe on\r\nThee. Only save me from the hand of my adversaries.” As he thus spoke, the\r\nAlemanni turned their backs and began to take flight. But when they saw\r\nthat their king was dead, they submitted to Chlodowech and said: “Let not,\r\nwe pray thee, a nation perish; now we are thine.” Thereupon he put an end\r\nto the war, exhorted the people, and returned home in peace. He told the\r\nqueen how by calling upon the name of Christ he had obtained victory. This\r\nhappened in the fifteenth year of his reign (496).\r\n\r\nCh. 31. Thereupon the queen commanded that the holy Remigius, bishop of\r\nRheims, be brought secretly to teach the king the word of salvation. The\r\npriest was brought to him secretly and began to lay before him that he\r\nshould believe in the true God, the creator of heaven and earth, and\r\nforsake idols, who could neither help him nor others. But he replied:\r\n“Gladly do I listen to thee, most holy Father, but one thing remains, for\r\nthe people who follow me suffer me not to forsake their gods. But I will\r\ngo and speak to them according to thy words.” When he met his men, and\r\nbefore he began to speak, all the people cried out together, for the\r\ndivine power had anticipated him: “We reject the mortal gods, pious king,\r\nand we are ready to follow the immortal God whom Remigius preaches.” These\r\nthings were reported to the bishop, who rejoiced greatly and commanded the\r\nfont to be prepared.… The king first asked to be baptized by the pontiff.\r\nHe went, a new Constantine, into the font to be washed clean from the old\r\nleprosy, and to purify himself in fresh water from the stains which he had\r\nlong had. But as he stepped into the baptismal water, the saint of God\r\nbegan in moving tone: “Bend softly thy head, Sicamber, reverence what thou\r\nhast burnt, and burn what thou hast reverenced.”…\r\n\r\nTherefore the king confessed Almighty God in Trinity, and was baptized in\r\nthe name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and was\r\nanointed with the holy chrism with the sign of the cross. Of his army more\r\nthan three thousand were baptized. Also his sister Albofledis was\r\nbaptized.… And another sister of the king, Lanthechildis by name, who had\r\nfallen into the heresy of the Arians, was converted, and when she had\r\nconfessed that the Son and the Holy Ghost were of the same substance with\r\nthe Father, she was given the chrism.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Gregory of Tours, _Hist. Francorum_, II, 35-38. (MSL, 71:232.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clovis at the head of the anti-Arian party in Gaul.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 35. When Alarich, the king of the Goths, saw that King Chlodowech\r\ncontinually conquered the nations, he sent messengers to him saying: “If\r\nmy brother wishes, it is also in my heart that we see each other, if God\r\nwill.” Chlodowech was not opposed to this and came to him. They met on an\r\nisland in the Loire, in the neighborhood of Amboise, in the territory of\r\nTours, and spake and ate and drank together, promised mutual friendship,\r\nand parted in peace.\r\n\r\nCh. 36. But already many Gauls wished with all their heart to have the\r\nFranks for their masters. It therefore happened that Quintianus, bishop of\r\nRhodez, was driven out of his city on account of this. For they said to\r\nhim: “You wish that the rule of the Franks possessed this land.” And a few\r\ndays after, when a dispute had arisen between him and the citizens, the\r\nrumor reached the Goths who dwelt in the city, for the citizens asserted\r\nthat he wished to be subject to the rule of the Franks; and they took\r\ncounsel and planned how they might kill him with the sword. When this was\r\nreported to the man of God, he rose by night, and with the most faithful\r\nof his servants left Rhodez and came to Arverne.…\r\n\r\nCh. 37. Thereupon King Chlodowech said to his men: “It is a great grief to\r\nme that these Arians possess a part of Gaul. Let us go forth with God’s\r\naid, conquer them, and bring this land into our power.” And since this\r\nspeech pleased all, he marched with his army toward Poitiers, for there\r\ndwelt Alarich at that time.… King Chlodowech met the king of the Goths,\r\nAlarich, in the Campus Vocladensis [Vouillé or Voulon-sur-Clain] ten miles\r\nfrom Poitiers; and while the latter fought from afar, the former withstood\r\nin hand to hand combat. But since the Goths, in their fashion, took to\r\nflight, King Chlodowech at length with God’s aid won the victory. He had\r\non his side a son of Sigbert the Lame, whose name was Chloderich. The same\r\nSigbert, ever since he fought with the Alemanni near Zulpich [in 496], had\r\nbeen wounded in the knee and limped. The king killed King Alarich and put\r\nthe Goths to flight.… From this battle Amalrich, Alarich’s son, fled to\r\nSpain, and by his ability obtained his father’s kingdom. Chlodowech,\r\nhowever, sent his son Theuderic to Albi, Rhodez, and Arverne, and\r\ndeparting he subjugated those cities, from the borders of the Goths to the\r\nborders of the Burgundians, to the rule of his father. But Alarich reigned\r\ntwenty-two years.\r\n\r\nChlodowech spent the winter in Bourdeaux, and carried away the entire\r\ntreasure of Alarich from Toulouse, and he went to Angoulême. Such favor\r\ndid the Lord show him that, when he looked on the walls, they fell of\r\nthemselves. Thereupon when the Goths had been driven from the city he\r\nbrought it under his rule. After the accomplishment of these victories he\r\nreturned to Tours and dedicated many gifts to the holy Church of St.\r\nMartin.\r\n\r\nCh. 38. At that time he received from the Emperor Anastasius the title of\r\nconsul, and in the Church of St. Martin he assumed the purple cloak and\r\nput on his head a diadem. He then mounted a horse and with his own hand\r\nscattered among the people who were present gold and silver in the\r\ngreatest profusion, all the way from the door of the porch of the Church\r\nof St. Martin to the city gate. And from this day forward he was addressed\r\nas consul, or Augustus. From Tours Chlodowech went to Paris and made that\r\nthe seat of his authority.(220)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Third Council of Toledo, A. D. 589, _Acts_. Mansi, IX, 992.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This council is the most important event in the history of the\r\n    Visigothic Church of Spain, marking the abandonment of Arianism by\r\n    the ruling race of Spain and the formal acceptance of the doctrine\r\n    of the Trinity or the Catholic faith and unity. The Suevi had\r\n    accepted Catholicism more than thirty-five years before; see Synod\r\n    of Braga, A. D. 563, in Hefele, § 285 (_cf._ also Hahn, § 176, who\r\n    gives the text of the anathematisms in which, after a statement of\r\n    the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity, the balance of the\r\n    anathematisms are concerned with Priscillianism). Reccared, the\r\n    Visigothic king (586-601), became a Catholic in 587, and held the\r\n    council of 589 to effect the conversion of the nation to his new\r\n    faith. For a letter of Gregory the Great on the conversion of\r\n    Reccared, see PNF, ser. II, vol. XII, pt. 2. p. 87, and two from\r\n    Gregory to Reccared himself (_ibid._, vol. XIII, pp. 16, 35). The\r\n    creed, as professed at Toledo, is the first instance of the\r\n    authorized use of the term \"and the Son\" in a creed in connection\r\n    with the doctrine of the “procession of the Holy Spirit,” the form\r\n    in which the so-called Nicene creed came to be used in the West,\r\n    and the source of much dispute between the East and the West in\r\n    the ninth century and ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. From the Speech of Reccared at the Opening of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nI judge that you are not ignorant, most reverend priests [_i.e._, bishops]\r\nthat I have called you into our presence for the restoration of\r\necclesiastical discipline; and because in time past the existence of\r\nheresy prevented throughout the entire Catholic Church the transaction of\r\nsynodical business. God, who has been pleased by our action to remove the\r\nobstacle of the same heresy, warns us to set in order the ecclesiastical\r\nlaws concerning church matters. Therefore let it be a matter of joy and\r\ngladness to you that the canonical order is being brought back to the\r\nlines of the times of our fathers, in the sight of God and to our glory.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. From the Statement of Faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is present here all the famous nation of the Goths, esteemed for\r\ntheir real bravery by nearly all nations, who, however, by the error of\r\ntheir teachers have been separated from the faith and unity of the\r\nCatholic Church; but now, agreeing as a whole with me in my assent to the\r\nfaith, participate in the communion of that Church which receives in its\r\nmaternal bosom a multitude of different nations and nourishes them with\r\nthe breasts of charity. Concerning her the prophet foretelling said: “My\r\nhouse shall be called the house of prayer for all nations.” For not only\r\ndoes the conversion of the Goths add to the amount of our reward, but also\r\nan infinite multitude of the people of the Suevi, whom under the\r\nprotection of Heaven we have subjected to our kingdom, led away into\r\nheresy by the fault of an alien,(221) we have endeavored to recall to the\r\nsource of truth. Therefore, most holy Fathers, I offer as by your hands to\r\nthe eternal God, as a holy and pleasing offering, these most noble\r\nnations, who have been attached by us to the Lord’s possessions. For it\r\nwill be to me in the day of the retribution of the just an unfading crown\r\nand joy if these peoples, who now by our planning have returned to the\r\nunity of the Church, remain founded and established in the same. For as by\r\nthe divine determination it has been a matter of our care to bring these\r\npeoples to the unity of the Church of Christ, so it is a matter of your\r\nteaching to instruct them in the Catholic dogmas, by which they may be\r\ninstructed in the full knowledge of the truth, that they may know how to\r\nreject totally the errors of pernicious heresy, to remain in charity in\r\nthe ways of the true faith, and to embrace with fervent desire the\r\ncommunion of the Catholic Church.… As it is of benefit to us to profess\r\nwith the mouth what we believe in the heart … therefore I anathematize\r\nArius with all his doctrines … so I hold in honor, to the praise and honor\r\nand glory of God, the faith of the holy Council of Nicæa.… I embrace and\r\nhold the faith of the one hundred and fifty Fathers assembled at\r\nConstantinople.… I believe the faith of the first Council of Ephesus …\r\nlikewise with all the Catholic Church I reverently receive the faith of\r\nthe Council of Chalcedon.… To this my confession I have added the holy\r\nconstitutions [_i.e._, confessions of faith] of the above-mentioned\r\ncouncils, and I have subscribed with complete singleness of heart to the\r\ndivine testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here follows the faith of Nicæa, the so-called creed of\r\n    Constantinople, with the words relating to the Holy Ghost, _ex\r\n    Patre et Filio procedentem_ (proceeding from the Father and the\r\n    Son); the actual form _filioque_ does not here occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. From the _Anathemas_, Hahn, § 178.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Whosoever does not believe in the Holy Ghost and will not believe that\r\nHe proceeds from the Father and the Son, and will not say that He is\r\nco-essential with the Father and the Son, let him be anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. From the _Canons_, Bruns, I, 212.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 1. After the damnation of the heresy of Arius and the exposition of\r\nthe Catholic faith, this holy council ordered that, because in the midst\r\nof many heretics and heathen throughout the churches of Spain, the\r\ncanonical order has been necessarily neglected (for while liberty of\r\ntransgressing abounded, and the desirable discipline was denied, and every\r\none fostered excesses of heresy in the protection and continuation of evil\r\ntimes, a strict discipline was far off, but now the peace of the Church\r\nhas been restored by the mercy of Christ), everything which by the\r\nauthority of early canons may be forbidden is forbidden, discipline\r\narising again, and everything is required which they order done. Let the\r\nconstitutions of all the councils remain in their force, likewise all the\r\nsynodical letters of the holy Roman prelates. Henceforth let no one aspire\r\nunworthily to ecclesiastical promotions and honors against the canons. Let\r\nnothing be done which the holy Fathers, filled with the Spirit of God,\r\ndecreed should not be done. And let those who presume to violate the laws\r\nbe restrained by the severity of the earlier canons.\r\n\r\nCanon 2. Out of reverence for the most holy faith and to strengthen the\r\nweak minds of men, acting upon the advice of the most pious and glorious\r\nKing Reccared(222) the synod has ordered that throughout the churches of\r\nSpain, Gaul, and Gallicia, the symbol of the faith be recited according to\r\nthe form of the Oriental churches, the symbol of the Council of\r\nConstantinople, that is, of the one hundred and fifty bishops; and before\r\nthe Lord’s prayer is said, let it be pronounced to the people in a clear\r\nvoice, by which also the true faith may have a manifest testimony, and the\r\nhearts of the people may approach to the reception of the body and blood\r\nof Christ with hearts purified by faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 98. The State Church in the Germanic Kingdoms\r\n\r\n\r\nSo long as the Germanic rulers remained Arian, the Catholic Church in\r\ntheir kingdoms was left for the most part alone or hindered in its\r\nsynodical activity. But as the kingdoms became Catholic on the conversion\r\nof their kings, the rulers were necessarily brought into close official\r\nrelations with the Church and its administration; and they exercised a\r\nstrict control over the ecclesiastical councils and the episcopal\r\nelections. The Merovingians, on their conversion from paganism, at once\r\nbecame Catholics, and they consequently assumed this control immediately.\r\nWith the extension of the Frankish kingdom, the authority of the king in\r\necclesiastical affairs was likewise extended. In Spain the Visigoths were\r\nArians until 589. On the conversion of the nation at that date, the king\r\nat once assumed an extensive ecclesiastical authority (for Reccared’s\r\nconfirmation of the Third Synod of Toledo, 589, see Bruns, I, 393), and in\r\nthe development of the system the councils of Toledo became at once the\r\nparliaments of the entire nation, now united through its common faith, and\r\nthe synods of the Church. This system was cut short by the Moslem invasion\r\nof 711, and the development of the Church and its relation to the State is\r\nto be studied in the Frankish kingdom in which from this time the\r\necclesiastical development of Western Europe is to be traced. The best\r\nevidence for the legal state of the Church under the Germanic rulers is\r\nchiefly in the acts of councils.\r\n\r\nBut there was also in the Catholic Church in the Germanic kingdoms a\r\nstrong monastic spirit which was by no means willing to see the Church\r\nbecome an “establishment.” This fitted in poorly with the condition of the\r\nState Church. It is illustrated by the career of St. Columbanus.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Council of Orleans, A. D. 511, _Synodical Letter_. Bruns, II, 160.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The king summons the council and approves its findings. Extract\r\n    from the synodical letter in which the canons are sent to\r\n    Chlodowech.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo their Lord, the Son of the Catholic Church, Chlodowech, the most\r\nglorious king, all the priests(223) whom you have commanded to come to the\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nBecause your great care for the glorious faith so moves you to reverence\r\nfor the Catholic religion that from love of the priesthood you have\r\ncommanded the bishops to be gathered together into one that they might\r\ntreat of necessary things, according to the proposals of your will and the\r\ntitles [_i.e._, topics] which you have given, we reply by determining\r\nthose things which seem good to us; so that if those things which we have\r\ndecreed prove to be right in your judgment, the approval of so great a\r\nking and lord might by a greater authority cause the determinations of so\r\nmany bishops to be observed more strictly.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Council of Orleans, A. D. 549, _Canons_. Bruns, II, 211.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Canons regarding Episcopal elections. The first instance in\r\n    canonical legislation in the West recognizing the necessity of\r\n    royal consent to the election of a bishop. For the relation of the\r\n    Pope to metropolitans, see in § 99 the Epistle of Gregory the\r\n    Great to Vigilius of Arles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 10. That it shall be lawful for no one to obtain the episcopate by\r\npayment or bargaining, but with the permission of the king, according to\r\nthe choice of the clergy and the people, as it is written in the ancient\r\ncanons, let him be consecrated by the metropolitan or by him whom he sends\r\nin his place, together with the bishops of the province. That if any one\r\nviolates by purchase the rule of this holy constitution, we decree that\r\nhe, who shall have been ordained for money, shall be deposed.\r\n\r\nCanon 11. Likewise as the ancient canons decree, no one shall be made\r\nbishop of those who are unwilling to receive him, and neither by the force\r\nof powerful persons are the citizens and clergy to be induced to give a\r\ntestimonial of election.(224) For this is to be regarded as a crime; that\r\nif this should be done, let him, who rather by violence than by legitimate\r\ndecree has been ordained bishop, be deposed forever from the honor of the\r\nepiscopate which he has obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Council of Paris, A. D. 557, _Canon_. Bruns, II, 221.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 8. No bishop shall be ordained for people against their will, but\r\nonly he whom the people and clergy in full election shall have freely\r\nchosen; neither by the command of the prince nor by any condition whatever\r\nagainst the will of the metropolitan and the bishops of the province shall\r\nhe be forced in. That if any one with so great rashness presumes by royal\r\nappointment(225) to reach the height of this honor, let him not deserve to\r\nbe received as a bishop by the bishops of the province in which the place\r\nis located, for they know that he was ordained improperly. If any of the\r\nfellow bishops of the province presume to receive him against this\r\nprohibition, let him be separated from all his brethren and be deprived of\r\nthe charity of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Gregory of Tours, _Hist. Francorum_, IV, 15. (MSL, 71:280.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The difficulty of the Church in living under the Merovingian\r\n    monarchs with their despotism and violence is illustrated by the\r\n    following passage. The date of the event is 556.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the clergy of Tours heard that King Chlothar [511-561; 558-561, as\r\nsurviving son of Chlodowech, sole ruler of the Franks] had returned from\r\nthe slaughter of the Saxons, they prepared the consensus(226) that they\r\nhad chosen the priest Eufronius bishop and went to the king. When they had\r\npresented the matter, the king answered: “I had indeed commanded that the\r\npriest Cato should be ordained there, and why has our command been\r\ndisregarded?” They answered him: “We have indeed asked him, but he would\r\nnot come.” And as they said this suddenly the priest Cato appeared and\r\nbesought the king to command that Cautinus be removed and himself be\r\nappointed bishop of Arverne.(227) But when the king laughed at this, he\r\nbesought him again, that he might be ordained for Tours, which he had\r\nbefore rejected. Then the king said to him: “I have already commanded that\r\nyou should be consecrated bishop of Tours, but, as I hear, you have\r\ndespised that church; therefore you shall be withheld from the government\r\nof it.” Thereupon he departed ashamed. But when the king asked concerning\r\nthe holy Eufronius, they said that he was a nephew of the holy Gregory,\r\nwhom we have mentioned above.(228) The king answered: “That is a\r\ndistinguished and very great family. Let the will of God and of the holy\r\nMartin(229) be done; let the election be confirmed.” And after he had\r\ngiven a decree for the ordination, the holy Eufronius was ordained as the\r\neighth bishop after St. Martin.(230)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Gregory of Tours, _Hist. Franc._, VIII, 22, (MSL, 71:464.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Royal interference in episcopal elections was not infrequent under\r\n    the Merovingians. Confused as the following account is, it is\r\n    clear from it that the kings were accustomed to violate the canons\r\n    and to exercise a free hand in episcopal appointments. See also\r\n    the preceding selection. The date of the event is 585. For the\r\n    Synod of Maçon, A. D. 585, see Hefele, § 286.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaban, Bishop of Eauze,(231) died that year. Desiderius, a layman,\r\nsucceeded him, although the king had promised with an oath that he would\r\nnever again ordain a bishop from the laity. But to what will not the\r\naccursed hunger for gold drive human hearts? Bertchramnus(232) had\r\nreturned from the synod,(233) and on the way was seized with a fever. The\r\ndeacon Waldo was summoned, who in baptism had also been called\r\nBertchramnus, and he committed to him the whole of his episcopal office,\r\nas he also committed to him the provisions regarding his testament, as\r\nwell as those who merited well by him. As he departed the bishop breathed\r\nout his spirit. The deacon returned and with presents and the\r\nconsensus(234) of the people, went to the king(235) but he obtained\r\nnothing. Then the king, having issued a mandate, commanded Gundegisilus,\r\ncount of Saintes, surnamed Dodo, to be consecrated bishop; and so it was\r\ndone. And because many of the clergy of Saintes before the synod had, in\r\nagreement with Bishop Bertchramnus, written various things against their\r\nBishop Palladius to humiliate him, after his(236) death they were arrested\r\nby the bishop, severely tortured, and stripped of their property.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Chlotar II, Capitulary, A.

They also\r\n    legislated on the affairs of the Church, _e.g._, on the election\r\n    of bishops. The text may also be found in Altmann und Bernheim,\r\n    _Ausgewählte Urkunden_.

It is our decree that the statutes of the canons be observed in all\r\nthings, and those of them which have been neglected in the past because of\r\nthe circumstances of the times shall hereafter be observed perpetually; so\r\nthat when a bishop dies one shall be chosen for his place by the clergy\r\nand people, who is to be ordained by the metropolitan and his provincials;\r\nif the person be worthy let him be ordained by the order of the prince;\r\nbut if he be chosen from the palace(237) let him be ordained on account of\r\nthe merit of his person and his learning.\r\n\r\nCh. 2.

The\r\n    best edition is in the MGH, _Scriptores rerum Merovingicarum_ II,\r\n    ed. Krusch. An account of the work may be found in DCB, art.\r\n    “Fredegarius Scholasticus.” In the Frankish kingdom the higher\r\n    clergy, especially the bishops, assembled with the great men of\r\n    the realm in councils under the king to discuss affairs of State.\r\n    These councils have been called _concilia mixta_. They are,\r\n    however, to be distinguished from the strictly ecclesiastical\r\n    assemblies in which the clergy alone acted. A change was\r\n    introduced by Charles the Great. The following passage shows the\r\n    king consulting with the bishops, along with the other nobles.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 75. In the eleventh year of his reign Dagobert came to the city of Metz,\r\nbecause the Wends at the command of Samo still manifested their savage\r\nfury and often made inroads from their territory to lay waste the Frankish\r\nkingdom, Thuringia, and other provinces. Dagobert, coming to Metz, with\r\nthe counsel of the bishops and nobles, and the consent of all the great\r\nmen of his kingdom, made his son, Sigibert, king of Austrasia, and\r\nassigned him Metz as his seat. To Chunibert, bishop of Cologne, and the\r\nDuke Adalgisel, he committed the conduct of his palace and kingdom.(238)\r\nAlso he gave to his son sufficient treasure and fitted him out with all\r\nthat was appropriate to his high dignity; and whatsoever he had given him\r\nhe confirmed by charters specially made out. Since then the Frankish land\r\nwas sufficiently defended by the zeal of the Austrasians against the\r\nWends.\r\n\r\n§ 76. When in the twelfth year of his reign a son named Chlodoveus was\r\nborn by Queen Nantechilde to Dagobert, he made, with the counsel and\r\nadvice of the Neustrians, an agreement with his Sigibert. All the great\r\nmen and the bishops of Austrasia and the other people of Sigibert, holding\r\nup their hands, confirmed it with an oath, that after the death of\r\nDagobert, Neustria and Burgundy, by an established ordinance, should fall\r\nto Chlodoveus; but Austrasia, because in population and extent it was\r\nequal to those lands, should belong in its entire extent to Sigibert.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Jonas, _Vita Columbani_, chs. 9, 12, 17, 32, 33, 59, 60. (MSL,\r\n87:1016.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Columbanus (543-615) was the most active and successful of the\r\n    Irish missionary monks laboring on the continent of Europe. In 585\r\n    Columbanus left Ireland to preach in the wilder parts of Gaul, and\r\n    in 590 or 591 founded Luxeuil, which became the parent monastery\r\n    of a considerable group of monastic houses. He came into conflict\r\n    with the Frankish clergy on account of the Celtic mode of fixing\r\n    the date of Easter [see Epistle of Columbanus among the Epistles\r\n    of Gregory the Great, to whom it is addressed, Bk. IX, Ep. 127,\r\n    PNF, ser. II, vol. XIII, p. 38; two other epistles on the subject\r\n    in MSL, vol. 80], his monastic rule [MSL, 80:209], and his\r\n    condemnatory attitude toward the dissoluteness of life prevalent\r\n    in Gaul among the clergy, as well as in the court. Banished from\r\n    Burgundy in 610 partly for political reasons, he worked for a time\r\n    in the vicinity of Lake Constance. In 612, leaving his disciple\r\n    Gallus [see _Vita S. Galli_, by Walafrid Strabo, MSL, 114; English\r\n    translation by C. W. Bispham, Philadelphia, 1908], he went to\r\n    Italy and, having founded Bobbio, died in 615. Gallus (_ob. circa_\r\n    640) subsequently founded the great monastery of St. Gall in\r\n    Switzerland, near Lake Constance. The Celtic monks on the\r\n    continent abandoned their Celtic peculiarities in the ninth\r\n    century and adopted the Benedictine rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Jonas, the author of the life of Columbanus, was a monk at Bobbio.\r\n    His life of Columbanus was written about 640; see DCB, “Jonas\r\n    (6).” In the following, the divisions and numbering of paragraphs\r\n    follow Migne’s edition. There is an excellent new edition in the\r\n    MGH, _Script. rerum Merovin._, ed. Krusch, 8vo, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Columbanus sets forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 9. Columbanus gathered such treasures of divine knowledge that even in\r\nhis youth he could expound the Psalter in polished discourse and could\r\nmake many other discourses, worthy of being sung and useful to teach.\r\nThereupon he took pains to be received into the company of monks, and\r\nsought the monastery of Benechor [in Ulster] the head of which, the\r\nblessed Commogellus, was famous for his many virtues. He was an excellent\r\nfather of his monks and highly regarded because of his zeal in religion\r\nand the maintenance of discipline according to the rule. And here he began\r\nto give himself entirely to prayer and fasting and to bear the yoke of\r\nChrist, easy to those who bear it, by denying himself and taking up his\r\ncross and following Christ, that he, who was to be the teacher of others,\r\nmight himself learn by teaching, and by mortification to endure in his own\r\nbody what he should abundantly show forth; and he who should teach what by\r\nothers ought to be fulfilled, himself first fulfilled. When many years had\r\npassed for him in the cloister, he began to desire to wander forth,\r\nmindful of the command which the Lord gave Abraham: “Get thee out of thy\r\ncountry and from thy kindred and from thy father’s house unto a land that\r\nI will show thee” [Gen. 12:1]. He confessed to Commogellus, the venerable\r\nFather, the warm desire of his heart, the desire enkindled by the fire of\r\nthe Lord [Luke 12:49]; but he received no such answer as he wished. For it\r\nwas a grief to Commogellus to bear the loss of a man so full of comfort.\r\nFinally Commogellus began to take courage and place it before his heart\r\nthat he ought to seek more to advance the benefit of others than to pursue\r\nhis own needs. It happened not without the will of the Almighty, who had\r\ntrained His pupil for future wars, that from his victories he might obtain\r\nglorious triumphs and gain joyful victories over the phalanxes of slain\r\nenemies. The abbot called Columbanus unto him and said that though it was\r\na grief to him yet he had come to a decision useful to others, that he\r\nwould remain in peace with him, would strengthen him with consolation, and\r\ngive him companions for his journey men who were known for their\r\nreligion.…\r\n\r\nSo Columbanus in the twentieth(239) year of his life set forth, and with\r\ntwelve companions under the leadership of Christ went down to the shore of\r\nthe sea. Here they waited the grace of Almighty God that he would prosper\r\ntheir undertaking, if it took place with His consent; and they perceived\r\nthat the will of the merciful Judge was with them. They embarked and began\r\nthe dangerous journey through the straits, and crossed a smooth sea with a\r\nfavorable wind, and after a quick passage reached the coasts of Brittany.…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Columbanus founds monasteries in Gaul.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 12. At that time there was a wide desert called Vosagus [the Vosges]\r\nin which there lay a castle long since in ruins. And ancient tradition\r\ncalled it Anagrates [Anegray]. When the holy man reached this place, in\r\nspite of its wild isolation, its rudeness, and the rocks, he settled there\r\nwith his companions, content with meagre support, mindful of the saying\r\nthat man lives not by bread alone, but, satisfied with the Word of Life,\r\nhe would have abundance and never hunger again unto eternity.\r\n\r\nCh. 17. When the number of the monks had increased rapidly, he began to\r\nthink of seeking in the same desert for a better place, where he might\r\nfound a monastery. And he found a place, which had formerly been strongly\r\nfortified, at a distance from the first place about eight miles, and which\r\nwas called in ancient times Luxovium.(240) Here there were warm baths\r\nerected with special art. A multitude of stone idols stood here in the\r\nnear-by forest, which in the old heathen times had been honored with\r\nexecrable practices and profane rites. Residing here, therefore, the\r\nexcellent man began to found a cloister. On hearing of this the people\r\ncame to him from all sides in order to dedicate themselves to the practice\r\nof religion, so that the great crowd of monks gathered together could\r\nhardly be contained in the company of one monastery. Here the children of\r\nnobles pressed to come, that, despising the scorned adornments of the\r\nworld and the pomp of present wealth, they might receive eternal rewards.\r\nWhen Columbanus perceived this and that from all sides the people came\r\ntogether for the medicines of penance, and that the walls of one monastery\r\ncould not without difficulty hold so great a body of converts to the\r\nreligious life, and although they were of one mind and one heart, yet it\r\nwas ill fitted to the intercourse of so great a multitude, he sought out\r\nanother place, which was excellent on account of its abundance of water,\r\nand founded a second monastery, which he named Fontanæ,(241) and placed\r\nrulers over it, of whose piety none doubted. As he now settled companies\r\nof monks in this place, he dwelt alternately in each and, filled with the\r\nHoly Ghost, he established a rule which they should observe that the\r\nprudent reader or hearer of it might know by what sort of discipline a man\r\nmight become holy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The quarrel of Columbanus with the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 32. It happened one day that the holy Columbanus came to Brunichildis,\r\nwho was at that time in Brocariaca.(242) When she saw him coming to the\r\ncourt she led to the man of God the sons of Theuderich, whom he had\r\nbegotten in adultery. He asked as he saw them what they wanted of him, and\r\nBrunichildis said: “They are the king’s sons; strengthen them with thy\r\nblessing.” But he answered: “Know then that these will never hold the\r\nroyal sceptre, for they have sprung from unchastity.” In furious anger she\r\ncommanded the boys to depart. The man of God thereupon left the royal\r\ncourt, and when he had crossed the threshold there arose a loud roar so\r\nthat the whole house shook, and all shuddered for fear; yet the rage of\r\nthe miserable woman could not be restrained. Thereupon she began to plot\r\nagainst the neighboring monasteries, and she caused a decree to be issued\r\nthat the monks should not be allowed to move freely outside the land of\r\nthe monastery, and that no one should give them any support or otherwise\r\nassist them with offerings.\r\n\r\nCh. 33. Against Columbanus Brunichildis excited the mind of the king and\r\nendeavored to disturb him; and she encouraged the minds of his princes,\r\nhis courtiers, and great men to set the mind of the king against the man\r\nof God, and she began to urge the bishops that by vilifying the religion\r\nof Columbanus they might dishonor the rule he had given his monks to\r\nobserve.…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Columbanus founds Bobbio.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 59. When the blessed Columbanus learned that Theudebert had been\r\nconquered by Theuderich, he left Gaul and Germany,(243) which were under\r\nTheuderich, and entered Italy where he was honorably received by Agilulf\r\nthe Lombard king, who gave him permission to dwell where he wished in\r\nItaly. It happened by the will of God that, while he was in Milan,\r\nColumbanus wishing to attack and root out by the use of the Scripture the\r\nerrors of the heretics, that is, the false doctrine of the Arians,\r\nlingered and composed an excellent work against them.(244)\r\n\r\n§ 60. While things were thus going on, a man named Jocundus came before\r\nthe king and reported to him that he knew of a church of the blessed\r\nPeter, prince of the Apostles, in a desert region of the Apennines, in\r\nwhich he learned that there were many advantages, being uncommonly\r\nfruitful and supplied with water full of fish. It was called in old time\r\nBobium(245) on account of the brook which flowed by it; another river in\r\nthe neighborhood was called Trebia, on which Hannibal, spending a winter,\r\nsuffered great losses of men, horses, and elephants. Thither Columbanus\r\nremoved and restored with all possible diligence the already half-ruined\r\nchurch in all its former beauty. The roof and the top of the temple and\r\nthe ruins of the walls he repaired and set to work to construct other\r\nthings necessary for a monastery.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 99. Gregory the Great and the Roman Church in the Second Half of the\r\nSixth Century\r\n\r\n\r\nGregory the Great was born about 540. In 573 he was appointed prefect of\r\nthe city of Rome, but resigned the following year to become a monk. Having\r\nbeen ordained deacon, he was sent in 579 to Constantinople as papal\r\napocrisiarius, or resident ambassador at the court of the Emperor. In 586\r\nhe was back in Rome and abbot of St. Andrew’s, and in 590 he was elected\r\nPope. As Pope his career was even more brilliant. He reorganized the papal\r\nfinances, carried through important disciplinary measures, and advanced\r\nthe cause of monasticism. His work as the organizer of missions in\r\nEngland, his labors to heal the Istrian schism, his relations with the\r\nLombards, his dealings with the Church in Gaul, his controversy with\r\nConstantinople in the matter of the title “Ecumenical Patriarch,” and\r\nother large relations and tasks indicate the range of his interests and\r\nthe extent of his activities. As a theologian Gregory interpreted\r\nAugustine for the Middle Ages and was the most important and influential\r\ntheologian of the West after Augustine and before the greater scholastics.\r\nHe did much to restore the prestige of his see, which had been lost in the\r\nearlier part of the sixth century. He died 604.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Selections from the writings of\r\n    Gregory, including many of his letters, may be found in PNF, ser.\r\n    II, vols. XII and XIII; see also _A Library of the Fathers of the\r\n    Holy Catholic Church_ (Oxford).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe selections under this section are arranged under four heads: (1)\r\nRelations with Gaul; (2) Relations with Constantinople; (3) Relations with\r\nthe Schism in Northern Italy; (4) Relations with the Lombards; for English\r\nmission, v. infra, § 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Relations with Gaul.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Gregory the Great, _Ep. ad Vigilium_, Reg. V, 53. (MSL, 77:782.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following letter was written in 595 in reply to a letter from\r\n    Vigilius, bishop of Arles, asking for the pallium (DCA, art.\r\n    “Pallium,” also _Cath. Encyc._) and the vicariate. For the\r\n    relation of the Roman see to the bishop of Arles as primate of\r\n    Gaul, see E. Loening, _Geschichte des deutschen Kirchenrechts_.\r\n    The relation of the vicariate to the papacy and also to the royal\r\n    power is indicated by the fact that the pallium is given in\r\n    response to the request of the king. The condition of the church\r\n    under Childebert is also shown; see § 98 for canons bearing on\r\n    simony and irregularities in connection with ordination.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to thy having asked therein [in a letter of Vigilius to Gregory]\r\naccording to ancient custom for the use of the pallium and the vicariate\r\nof the Apostolic See, far be it from me to suspect that thou hast sought\r\neminence of transitory power, or the adornment of external worship, in our\r\nvicariate and the pallium. But, since it is known to all whence the holy\r\nfaith proceeded in the regions of Gaul, when your fraternity asks for a\r\nrepetition of the early custom of the Apostolic See, what is it but that a\r\ngood offspring reverts to the bosom of its mother? With willing mind\r\ntherefore we grant what has been requested, lest we should seem either to\r\nwithhold from you anything of the honor due to you, or to despise the\r\npetition of our most excellent son, King Childebert.…\r\n\r\nI have learned from certain persons informing me that in the parts of Gaul\r\nand Germany no one attains to holy orders except for a consideration\r\ngiven. If this is so, I say it with tears, I declare it with groans, that,\r\nwhen the priestly order has fallen inwardly, neither will it be able to\r\nstand outwardly for long.…\r\n\r\nAnother very detestable thing has also been reported to us, that some\r\npersons being laymen, through the desire of temporal glory, are tonsured\r\non the death of bishops, and all at once are made priests.…\r\n\r\nOn this account your fraternity must needs take care to admonish our most\r\nexcellent son, King Childebert, that he remove entirely the stain of this\r\nsin from his kingdom, to the end that Almighty God may give him so much\r\nthe greater recompense with himself as He sees him both love what He loves\r\nand shun what He hates.\r\n\r\nAnd so we commit to your fraternity, according to ancient custom, under\r\nGod, our vicariate in the churches which are under the dominion of our\r\nmost excellent son Childebert, with the understanding that their proper\r\ndignity, according to primitive usage, be preserved to the several\r\nmetropolitans. We have also sent a pallium which thy fraternity will use\r\nwithin the Church for the solemnization of mass only. Further, if any of\r\nthe bishops should by any chance wish to travel to any considerable\r\ndistance, let it not be lawful for him to remove to other places without\r\nthe authority of thy holiness. If any question of faith, or it may be\r\nrelating to other matters, should have arisen among the bishops, which\r\ncannot easily be settled, let it be ventilated and decided in an assembly\r\nof twelve bishops. But if it cannot be decided after the truth has been\r\ninvestigated, let it be referred to our judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Relations with Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Gregory the Great, _Ep. ad Johannem Jejunatorem_, Reg. V, 44. (MSL,\r\n77:738.) _Cf._ Mirbt, n. 180.\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the title “Ecumenical Patriarch.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    The controversy over the title “Ecumenical Patriarch” was a result\r\n    of Gregory’s determination to carry through, as far as possible,\r\n    the Petrine rights and duties as he conceived them. The title was\r\n    probably intended to mark the superiority of Constantinople to the\r\n    other patriarchates in the East, according to the Eastern\r\n    principle that the political rank of a city determined its\r\n    ecclesiastical rank. It seemed to Gregory to imply a position of\r\n    superiority to the see of Peter. As it certainly might imply that,\r\n    he consistently opposed it. But it had been a title in use for\r\n    nearly a century. (_Cf._ Gieseler, KG, Eng. trans., vol. I, p.\r\n    504.) Justinian in 533 so styled the patriarch of Constantinople\r\n    (Cod. I, 1, 7). For the difference in point of view between the\r\n    East and the West as to rank of great sees, see Leo’s letters on\r\n    the 28th canon of Chalcedon, A. D. 451, _supra_, in § 86.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time when your fraternity was advanced in sacerdotal dignity, you\r\nrecall what peace and concord of the churches you found. But, with what\r\ndaring or with what swelling of pride I know not, you have attempted to\r\nseize upon a new name for yourself, whereby the hearts of all your\r\nbrethren would be offended. I wonder exceedingly at this, since I remember\r\nthat in order not to attain to the episcopal office thou wouldest have\r\nfled. But now that thou hast attained unto it, thou desirest so to\r\nexercise it as if thou hadst run after it with ambitious desire. And thou\r\nwho didst confess thyself unworthy to be called a bishop, hast at length\r\nbeen brought to such a pitch that, despising thy brethren, thou desirest\r\nto be named the only bishop. And in regard to this matter, weighty letters\r\nwere sent to thy holiness by my predecessor Pelagius, of holy memory, and\r\nin them he annulled the acts of the synod,(246) which had been assembled\r\namong you in the case of our former brother and fellow priest, Gregory,\r\nbecause of that execrable title of pride, and forbade the archdeacon whom\r\nhe sent according to custom to the feet of our Lord(247) to celebrate the\r\nsolemnities of the mass with thee. But after his death, when I, an\r\nunworthy man, succeeded to the government of the Church, I took care,\r\nformerly through thy representatives, and now through our common son and\r\ndeacon, Sabianus, to address thy fraternity, not indeed in writing, but by\r\nword of mouth, desiring thee to refrain thyself from such presumption; and\r\nin case thou wouldest not amend I forbade his celebrating the solemnities\r\nof the mass with thee; that so I might appeal to thy holiness through a\r\ncertain sense of shame, and then, if the execrable and profane assumption\r\ncould not be corrected through shame, I might resort to canonical and\r\nprescribed measures. And because sores that are to be cut away should\r\nfirst be stroked with a gentle hand, I beg of thee, I beseech thee, and,\r\nas kindly as I can, I demand of thee that thy fraternity rebuke all who\r\nflatter thee and offer thee this name of error, and not consent to be\r\ncalled by a foolish and proud title. For truly I say it weeping, and out\r\nof deepest sorrow of heart attribute it to my sins, that this my brother,\r\nwho has been placed in the episcopal order, that he might bring back the\r\nsouls of others to humility, has, up to the present time, been incapable\r\nof being brought back to humility; that he who teaches truth to others has\r\nnot consented to teach himself, even when I implore him.\r\n\r\nConsider, I pray thee, that by this rash presumption the peace of the\r\nwhole Church is disturbed, and that it is in contradiction to the grace\r\npoured out on all in common; in which grace thou thyself wilt be able to\r\ngrow so far as thou thyself wilt determine to do so. And thou wilt become\r\nby so much the greater as thou restrainest thyself from the usurpation of\r\nproud and foolish titles; and thou wilt advance in proportion as thou art\r\nnot bent on arrogation by the humiliation of thy brethren.… Certainly\r\nPeter, the first of the Apostles, was a member of the holy and universal\r\nChurch; Paul, Andrew, John—what are they but the heads of particular\r\ncommunities? And yet all are members under one Head. And to bind all\r\ntogether in a short phrase, the saints before the Law, the saints under\r\nthe Law, the saints under grace, all these making up the Lord’s body were\r\nconstituted as members of the Church, and not one of them has ever wished\r\nhimself to be called “universal.”…\r\n\r\nIs it not the fact, as your fraternity knows, that the prelates of this\r\nApostolic See, which by the providence of God I serve, had the honor\r\noffered them by the venerable Council of Chalcedon of being called\r\n“universal”?(248) But yet not one of them has ever wished to be called by\r\nsuch a title, or seized upon this rash name, lest, if in virtue of the\r\nrank of the pontificate, he took to himself the glory of singularity, he\r\nmight seem to have denied it to all his brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Gregory the Great, _Ep. ad Phocam_, Reg. XIII, 31. (MSL, 77:1281.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Epistle to Phocas congratulating him on his accession.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Phocas (602-610) was a low-born, ignorant centurion whom chance\r\n    had placed at the head of a successful rebellion originating in\r\n    the army of the Danube. The rebellion was successful, and the\r\n    Emperor Maurice was murdered, together with his sons. Maurice had\r\n    been unsuccessful in war, unpopular with the army, and his\r\n    financial measures had been oppressive. Phocas was utterly\r\n    incompetent as a ruler, licentious and sanguinary as a man. His\r\n    reign was a period of horror and blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nGregory to Phocas. Glory to God in the highest, who, according as it is\r\nwritten, changes times, and transfers kingdoms, because He has made\r\napparent to all what He has vouchsafed to speak by His prophet, that the\r\nmost High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He\r\nwill [Dan. 4:17]. For in the incomprehensible dispensation of Almighty God\r\nthere is an alternating control of human life, and sometimes, when the\r\nsins of many are to be smitten, one is raised up through whose hardness\r\nthe necks of subjects may be bowed down under the yoke of tribulation, as\r\nin our affliction we have long had proof. But sometimes, when the merciful\r\nGod has decreed to refresh with His consolation the mourning hearts of\r\nmany, He advances one to the summit of government, and through the bowels\r\nof His mercy infuses in the minds of all the grace of exultation in Him.\r\nIn which abundance of exultation we believe that we, who rejoice that the\r\nbenignity of your piety has arrived at imperial supremacy, shall speedily\r\nbe confirmed. “Let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad” [Psalm\r\n96:11], and let the whole people of the republic, hitherto afflicted\r\nexceedingly, grow cheerful for your benignant deeds. Let the proud minds\r\nof enemies be subdued to the yoke of your domination. Let the sad and\r\ndepressed spirit of subjects be relieved by your mercy. Let the power of\r\nheavenly grace make you terrible to your enemies; let piety make you kind\r\nto your subjects. Let the whole republic have rest in your most happy\r\ntimes, since the pillage of peace under the color of legal processes has\r\nbeen exposed. Let plottings about testaments cease, and benevolences\r\nextorted by violence end. Let secure possession of their own goods return\r\nto all, that they may rejoice in possessing without fear what they have\r\nacquired without fraud. Let every single person’s liberty be now at length\r\nrestored to each one under the yoke of the holy Empire. For there is this\r\ndifference between the kings of the nations and the emperors of the\r\nrepublic: the kings of the nations are lords of slaves, but the emperors\r\nlords of free men. But we shall better speak of these things by praying\r\nthan by putting you in mind of them. May Almighty God keep the heart of\r\nyour piety in the hand of His grace in every thought and deed. Whatsoever\r\nthings should be done justly, whatever things with clemency, may the Holy\r\nGhost, who dwells in your breast direct, that your clemency may both be\r\nexalted in a temporal kingdom and after the course of many years attain to\r\nheavenly kingdoms.

Gregory and the Schism in North Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Among the results of the Fifth General Council of Constantinople,\r\n    553, was a wide-spread schism in the northern part of Italy and\r\n    adjacent lands. The bishops of the western part of Lombardy, under\r\n    the lead of the bishop of Milan, together with the bishops of\r\n    Venetia, Istria, and a portion of Illyricum, Rhætia Secunda, and\r\n    Noricum, under the bishop of Aquileia, renounced communion with\r\n    the see of Rome, and became autocephalic. Even bishops in Tuscany\r\n    abandoned communion with the see of Rome because the council and\r\n    Vigilius had condemned Theodore, Theodoret, and Ibas (_v. supra_,\r\n    § 93). Justin II attempted to heal the schism, and his verbose\r\n    edict may be found in Evagrius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 4. A serious\r\n    problem was presented to the Roman see. In dealing with them,\r\n    however, it was possible to treat each group separately. On\r\n    account of the Lombard invasion the bishop of Aquileia removed his\r\n    see to Grado. Gregory the Great had some success in drawing the\r\n    schismatics into more friendly relations. But not till 612 was the\r\n    see of Aquileia-Grado in communion with Rome. A rival bishop was\r\n    elected, who removed his see to old Aquileia. See extract from\r\n    Paulus Diaconus (_f_). And the opposition was maintained until\r\n    about 700. The Milanese portion of the schism had long since\r\n    ended. Of Gregory’s epistles several bearing on the schism are\r\n    available in PNF, ser. II, vols. XII and XIII: Reg. I, 16; II, 46,\r\n    51; IV, 2, 38, 39; V, 51; IX, 9, 10; XIII, 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Gregory the Great, _Ep. ad Constantium_, Reg. IV, 2. (MSL, 77:669.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGregory to Constantius, Bishop of Milan. My beloved son, the deacon\r\nBoniface, has given me information from a private letter of thy\r\nfraternity: namely, that three bishops, having sought out rather than\r\nhaving found an occasion, have separated themselves from the pious\r\ncommunion of thy fraternity, saying that thou hast assented to the\r\ncondemnation of the three chapters and hast given a solemn pledge. And,\r\nindeed, whether there has been any mention made of the three chapters in\r\nany word or writing whatever, thy fraternity remembers well; although thy\r\nfraternity’s predecessor, Laurentius (_circa_ 573), did send a most strict\r\nsecurity to the Apostolic See, and to it a legal number of the most noble\r\nmen subscribed; among whom, I also, at that time holding the prætorship of\r\nthe city, likewise subscribed; because, when such a schism had taken place\r\nabout nothing, it was right that the Apostolic See should be careful to\r\nguard in all respects the unity of the universal Church in the minds of\r\npriests. But as to its being said that our daughter, Queen\r\nTheodelinda,(249) after hearing this news has withdrawn herself from thy\r\ncommunion, it is perfectly evident that though she has been seduced to\r\nsome little extent by the words of wicked men, yet when Hippolytus the\r\nnotary and John the abbot arrive, she will seek in all ways the communion\r\nof the fraternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Gregory the Great, _Ep. ad Constantium_, Reg. IV, 39. (MSL, 77:713.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In reply to a letter from Constantius of Milan informing Gregory\r\n    that the demand had been made upon him by the clergy of Brescia\r\n    that he should take an oath that he, Constantius, had not\r\n    condemned the Three Chapters, _i.e._, had not accepted the Fifth\r\n    General Council, Gregory advises him to take no such oath.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut lest those who have thus written to you should be offended, send them\r\na letter declaring under an imposition of an anathema that you neither\r\ntake away anything from the faith of the synod of Chalcedon nor receive\r\nthose who do, and that you condemn whatsoever it condemned and absolve\r\nwhatsoever it absolved. And thus I believe that they may soon be\r\nsatisfied.… As to what you have written to the effect that you are\r\nunwilling to transmit my letter to Queen Theodelinda on the ground that\r\nthe fifth synod is named in it, for you believed that she might be\r\noffended, you did right not to transmit it. We are therefore doing now as\r\nyou recommended, namely, only expressing approval of the four synods. Yet\r\nas to the synod which was afterward called at Constantinople, which is\r\ncalled by many the fifth, I would have you know that it neither ordained\r\nnor held anything in opposition to the four most holy synods, seeing that\r\nnothing was done in it with respect to the faith, but only with respect to\r\nthree persons, about whom nothing is contained in the acts of the Council\r\nof Chalcedon;(250) but after the canons had been promulgated, discussion\r\narose, and final action was ventilated concerning persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Paulus Diaconus, _Historia Langobardorum_, IV, 32, 33, 36. (MSL,\r\n95:657.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The continuation of the schism in Istria and the rise of the two\r\n    patriarchates of Aquileia. The Emperor Phocas and the title “Head\r\n    of All the Churches.”\r\n\r\n\r\n32. In the following month of November [A. D. 605] King Agilulf concluded\r\npeace with the Patrician Smaragdus for a year, and received from the\r\nRomans twelve thousand solidi. Also the Tuscan cities Balneus Regis\r\n[Bagnarea] and Urbs Vetus [Orvieto] were conquered by the Lombards. Then\r\nappeared in the heavens in the months of April and May a star which is\r\ncalled a comet. Thereupon King Agilulf again made a peace with the Romans\r\nfor three years.\r\n\r\n33. In the same days after the death of the patriarch Severus, the abbot\r\nJohn was made patriarch of old Aquileia in his place with the approval of\r\nthe king and Duke Gisulf. Also in Grados [Grado] the Roman(251)\r\nCandidianus was appointed bishop. In the months of November and December a\r\ncomet was again visible. After the death of Candidianus, Epiphanius, who\r\nhad formerly been the papal chief notary, was elected patriarch by the\r\nbishops who stood under the Romans; and since this time there were two\r\npatriarchs.\r\n\r\n36. Phocas, as also has been related above, after the murder of Maurice\r\nand his sons, obtained the Roman Empire and ruled for eight years. At the\r\nrequest of Pope Boniface(252) he decreed that the seat of the Roman and\r\nApostolic Church should be the head of all churches [_caput omnium\r\necclesiarum_], because the Church of Constantinople in a proclamation had\r\nnamed itself first of all. At the request of another Pope Boniface,(253)\r\nhe commanded that the idolatrous rubbish should be removed from the old\r\ntemple which bore the name of the Pantheon, and from it a church should be\r\nmade to the holy Virgin Mary and all martyrs, so that where formerly the\r\nservice not of all gods but of all idols was celebrated, now only the\r\nmemory of all saints should be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Gregory the Great and the Lombards.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Lombards entered Italy 568, and gradually spread over nearly\r\n    all the peninsula. The territories retained by the Emperor from\r\n    the conquests of Justinian were only the Exarchate of Ravenna, the\r\n    Ducatus Romanus, and the Ducatus Neapolitanus, the extreme\r\n    southern parts of the peninsula and Liguria. The Lombards were the\r\n    last Germanic tribe to settle within the Empire, and like so many\r\n    others they were Arians. Theodelinda, the queen of the Lombards,\r\n    was a Bavarian princess and a Catholic. Her second husband,\r\n    Agilulf, seems to have been favorably disposed to Catholicism, far\r\n    more so than Authari, her first husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Paulus Diaconus, _Historia Langobardorum_, IV, 5-9. (MSL, 95:540.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Paulus Warnefridi, known as Paulus Diaconus (circa 720-circa 800),\r\n    was himself a Lombard, and in writing his _History of the\r\n    Lombards_ shows himself the patriot as well as the loyal son of\r\n    the Roman Church. To do this was at times difficult. The work is\r\n    one of the most attractive histories written in the Middle Ages.\r\n    For nearly all of his history, Paulus is dependent upon older\r\n    sources, but he restates the older accounts in clear and careful\r\n    fashion. The connection between the various extracts is not always\r\n    felicitous, yet he has succeeded in producing one of the great\r\n    books of history. For an analysis of the sources, see F. H. B.\r\n    Daniell, art. “Paulus (70) Diaconus” in DCB. The best edition is\r\n    that by Bethmann and Waitz in the MGH, _Scriptores rerum\r\n    Langobardorum et Italicarum sæc._ VI-IX, also in the 8vo edition.\r\n    There is an English translation of the entire work in the\r\n    _Translations and Reprints of the Historical Department of the\r\n    University of Pennsylvania_.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. At that time the learned and pious Pope Gregory, after he had already\r\nwritten much for the benefit of the holy Church, wrote also four books\r\nconcerning the lives of the saints; these books he called _Dialogus_, that\r\nis, conversation, because in them he has introduced himself speaking with\r\nhis deacon Peter. The Pope sent these books to Queen Theodelinda, whom he\r\nknew to be true in the faith in Christ and abounding in good works.\r\n\r\n6. Through this queen the Church of God obtained many and great\r\nadvantages. For the Lombards, when they were still held by heathen\r\nunbelief, had taken possession of the entire property of the Church. But,\r\ninduced by successful requests of the queen, the king, holding fast to the\r\nCatholic faith,(254) gave the Church of Christ many possessions and\r\nassigned to the bishops, who had theretofore been oppressed and despised,\r\ntheir ancient place of honor once more.\r\n\r\n7. In these days Tassilo was made king of Bavaria by the Frankish king\r\nChildebert. With an army he immediately marched into the land of the\r\nSlavs, and with great booty returned to his own land.\r\n\r\n9. At the same time the patrician and exarch of Ravenna, Romanus,(255)\r\nwent to Rome. On his return to Ravenna he took possession of the cities\r\nwhich had been taken by the Lombards. The names of them are: Sutrium\r\n[Sutri], Polimarcium [near Bomarzio and west of Orte], Horta [Orte], Tuder\r\n[Todi], Ameria [Amelia], Perusia [Perugia], Luceoli [near Gubbio], and\r\nseveral others. When King Agilulf received word of this, he at once\r\nmarched forth from Ticinus with a strong army and pitched before the city\r\nof Perusia. Here he besieged several days the Lombard duke Marisio, who\r\nhad gone over to the side of the Romans, took him prisoner, and without\r\ndelay had him executed. On the approach of the king, the holy Pope Gregory\r\nwas so filled with fear that, as he himself reports in his homilies, he\r\nbroke off the explanation of the temple, to be read about in Ezekiel; King\r\nAgilulf returned to Ticinus after he had settled the matter, and not long\r\nafter, chiefly on account of the entreaties of his wife, Queen\r\nTheodelinda, who had often been advised in letters by the holy Father\r\nGregory to do so, he concluded with Gregory and the Romans a lasting\r\npeace. To thank her for this, the venerable priest sent the following\r\nletter to the queen:\r\n\r\nGregory to Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards. How your excellency has\r\nlabored earnestly and kindly, as is your wont, for the conclusion of\r\npeace, we have learned from the report of our son, the abbot Probus. Nor,\r\nindeed, was it otherwise to be expected of your Christianity than that you\r\nwould in all ways show assiduity and goodness in the cause of peace.\r\nWherefore, we give thanks to Almighty God, who so rules your heart with\r\nHis lovingkindness that, as He has given you a right faith, so He also\r\ngrants you to work always what is pleasing in His sight. For you may be\r\nassured, most excellent daughter, that for the saving of much bloodshed on\r\nboth sides you have acquired no small reward. On this account, returning\r\nthanks for your good-will, we implore the mercy of God to repay you with\r\ngood in body and soul here and in the world to come. Moreover, greeting\r\nyou with fatherly affection, we exhort you so to deal with your most\r\nexcellent consort that he may not reject the alliance of the Christian\r\nrepublic. For, as I believe you yourself know, it is in many ways\r\nprofitable that he should be inclined to betake himself to its friendship.\r\nDo you then, after your manner, always strive for what tends to good-will\r\nand conciliation between the parties, and labor wherever an occasion of\r\nreaping a reward presents itself, that you may commend your good deeds the\r\nmore before the eyes of Almighty God.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 100. The Foundation of the Anglo-Saxon Church\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon Church owes its foundation to the missionary zeal and wise\r\ndirection of Gregory the Great. Augustine, whom Gregory sent, arrived in\r\nthe kingdom of Kent 597, and established himself at Canterbury. In 625,\r\nPaulinus began his work at York, and Christianity was accepted by the\r\nNorthumbrian king and many nobles. On the death of King Eadwine, Paulinus\r\nwas obliged to leave the kingdom. Missionaries were brought into\r\nNorthumbria in 635 from the Celtic Church, the centre of which was at\r\nIona, where the new king Oswald had taken refuge on the death of Eadwine.\r\nAidan now became the leader of the Northern Church. As the\r\nChristianization of the land advanced and Roman customs were introduced\r\ninto the northern kingdom, practical inconveniences as to the different\r\nmethods of reckoning the date of Easter, in which the North Irish and the\r\nCelts of Scotland differed from the rest of the Christian Church, came to\r\na settlement of the difficulty at Streaneshalch, or Whitby, 664. Colman,\r\nBishop of Lindisfarne, the leader of the Celtic party, withdrew, and\r\nWilfrid, afterward bishop of York, took the lead under the influence of\r\nthe Roman tradition. The Church of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, now in\r\nagreement as to custom, was organized by Theodore of Canterbury (668-690),\r\nand developed a remarkable intellectual life, becoming, in fact, for the\r\nfirst part at least of the eighth century, the centre of Western\r\ntheological and literary culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: Bede, _Ecclesiastical History of the\r\n    English People_, for editions, _v. supra_, § 96.

(MSL, 95:69.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The scheme of Gregory the Great for the organization of the\r\n    English Church A. D. 601.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gregory, in planning his mission, seems not to have been aware of\r\n    the profound changes in the kingdom resulting from the Anglo-Saxon\r\n    invasion. He selected York as the seat of an archbishop, because\r\n    it was the ancient capital of the Roman province in the North, and\r\n    London, because it was the great city of the South. The rivalry of\r\n    the two archbishops caused difficulties for centuries, and was a\r\n    hinderance to the efficiency of the ecclesiastical system. By this\r\n    letter, the British bishops were to be under the authority of\r\n    Augustine, a position which was distasteful to the British, who\r\n    were extremely hostile to the Anglo-Saxons, and incomprehensible\r\n    to them, as they saw no reason or justification in any such\r\n    arrangement without their consent. They withdrew from all\r\n    intercourse with the new Anglo-Saxon Church and retired into\r\n    Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the most reverend and holy brother and fellow bishop, Augustine,\r\nGregory, servant of the servants of God.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is certain that the unspeakable rewards of the eternal kingdom\r\nare laid up for those who labor for Almighty God, yet it is necessary for\r\nus to render to them the benefits of honors, that from this recompense\r\nthey may be able to labor more abundantly in the zeal for spiritual work.\r\nAnd because the new Church of the English has been brought by thee to the\r\ngrace of Almighty God, by the bounty of the same Lord and by your toil, we\r\ngrant you the use of the pallium, in the same to perform only the\r\nsolemnities of the mass, in order that in the various places you ordain\r\ntwelve bishops who shall be under your authority, so that the bishop of\r\nthe city of London ought always thereafter to be consecrated by his own\r\nsynod and receive the pallium of honor from the holy Apostolic See, which\r\nby God’s authority I serve.(256) Moreover, we will that you send to York a\r\nbishop whom you shall see fit to ordain, yet so that if the same city\r\nshall have received the word of God along with the neighboring places, he\r\nshall ordain twelve other bishops, and enjoy the honor of metropolitan,\r\nbecause if our life last, we intend, with the Lord’s favor, to give him\r\nthe pallium also. And we will that he be subject to your authority, my\r\nbrother. But after your decease he shall preside over the bishops he has\r\nordained, so that he shall not be subject in anywise to the bishop of\r\nLondon. Moreover, let there be a distinction of honor between the bishops\r\nof the city of London and of York, in such a way that he shall take the\r\nprecedence who has been ordained first. But let them arrange in concord by\r\ncommon counsel and harmonious action the things which need to be done for\r\nthe zeal for Christ; let them determine rightly and let them accomplish\r\nwhat they have decided upon without any mutual misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nBut you, my brother, shall have subject to you not only the bishops whom\r\nyou have ordained and those ordained by the bishop of York, but also, by\r\nthe authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, the priests [_i.e._, the bishops]\r\nof Britain; so that from the lips of your holiness they may receive the\r\nform both of correct faith and of holy life, and fulfilling the duties of\r\ntheir office in faith and morals may, when the Lord wills, attain to the\r\nkingdom of heaven. May God keep you safe, most reverend brother.

Ec._, III, 25 _f._ (MSL, 95:158.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Easter dispute and the synod of Whitby. The triumph of the\r\n    Roman tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sharpest dispute between the Celtic and the Roman churches was\r\n    on the date of Easter as presenting the most inconveniences. The\r\n    principal points were as follows: Both parties agreed that it must\r\n    be on Sunday, in the third week of the first lunar month, and the\r\n    paschal full moon must not fall before the vernal equinox. But the\r\n    Celts placed the vernal equinox on March 25, and the Romans on\r\n    March 21. The Celts, furthermore, reckoned as the third week the\r\n    14th to the 20th days of the moon inclusive; the Romans the 15th\r\n    to the 21st inclusive. The Irish Church in the southern part of\r\n    Ireland had already adopted the Roman reckoning at the synod of\r\n    Leighlin, 630-633 [Hefele, § 289]. The occasion of the difference\r\n    of custom was, in reality, that the Romans had adopted in the\r\n    previous century a more correct method of reckoning and one that\r\n    had fewer practical inconveniences. For a statement by a Celt, see\r\n    Epistle of Columbanus to Gregory the Great, in the latter’s\r\n    _Epistolæ_, Reg. IX, Ep. 127 (PNF, ser. II, vol. XIII, p. 38). In\r\n    the following selection space has been saved by omissions which\r\n    are, however, indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time [_circa_ 652] a great and frequent controversy happened about\r\nthe observance of Easter; those that came from Kent or France asserting\r\nthat the Scots kept Easter Sunday contrary to the custom of the universal\r\nChurch. Among them was a most zealous defender of the true Easter, whose\r\nname was Ronan, a Scot by nation, but instructed in ecclesiastical truth,\r\neither in France or Italy, who disputed with Finan,(257) and convinced\r\nmany, or at least induced them, to make a stricter inquiry after the\r\ntruth; yet he could not prevail upon Finan … James, formerly the deacon of\r\nthe venerable archbishop Paulinus … kept the true and Catholic Easter,\r\nwith all those that he could persuade to adopt the right way. Queen\r\nEanfleda [wife of Oswy, king of Northumbria] and her attendants also\r\nobserved the same as she had seen practised in Kent, having with her a\r\nKentish priest that followed the Catholic mode, whose name was Romanus.\r\nThus it is said to have happened in those times that Easter was kept twice\r\nin one year;(258) and that when the king, having ended the time of\r\nfasting, kept his Easter, the queen and her attendants were still fasting\r\nand celebrating Palm Sunday.…\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Finan [662] … when Colman, who was also sent out of\r\nScotland, came to be bishop, a great controversy arose about the\r\nobservance of Easter, and the rules of ecclesiastical life.… This reached\r\nthe ears of King Oswy and his son Alfrid; for Oswy, having been instructed\r\nand baptized by the Scots, and being very perfectly skilled in their\r\nlanguage, thought nothing better than what they taught. But Alfrid, having\r\nbeen instructed in Christianity by Wilfrid, a most learned man, who had\r\nfirst gone to Rome to learn the ecclesiastical doctrine, and spent much\r\ntime at Lyons with Dalfinus, archbishop of France, from whom he had\r\nreceived the ecclesiastical tonsure, rightly thought this man’s doctrine\r\nought to be preferred to all the traditions of the Scots.…\r\n\r\nThe controversy having been started concerning Easter, the tonsure, and\r\nother ecclesiastical matters, it was agreed that a synod should be held in\r\nthe monastery of Streaneshalch, which signifies the bay of the lighthouse,\r\nwhere the Abbess Hilda, a woman devoted to God, presided; and that there\r\nthe controversy should be decided. The kings, both father and son, came\r\nhither. Bishop Colman, with his Scottish clerks, and Agilbert,(259) and\r\nthe priests Agatho and Wilfrid. James and Romanus were on their side. But\r\nthe Abbess Hilda and her associates were for the Scots, as was also the\r\nvenerable bishop Cedd, long before ordained by the Scots.… Then Colman\r\nsaid: “The Easter which I keep, I received from my elders who sent me\r\nhither as bishop; all our fathers, men beloved of God, are known to have\r\nkept it in the same manner; and that the same may not seem to any to be\r\ncontemptible or worthy of being rejected, it is the same which St. John\r\nthe Evangelist, the disciple especially beloved of our Lord, with all the\r\nchurches over which he presided, is recorded as having observed.…”\r\n\r\nWilfrid, having been ordered by the king to speak, said: “The Easter which\r\nwe observe we saw celebrated by all at Rome, where the blessed Apostles,\r\nPeter and Paul, lived, taught, suffered, and were buried; we saw the same\r\ndone in Italy and France, when we travelled through those countries for\r\npilgrimage and prayer. We found the same practised in Africa, Asia, Egypt,\r\nGreece, and in all the world, wherever the Church of Christ is spread\r\nabroad, through several nations and tongues, at one and the same time …\r\nexcept only those and their accomplices in obstinacy, I mean the Picts and\r\nthe Britons, who foolishly, in these two remote islands of the world, and\r\nonly in part of them, oppose all the rest of the universe.… John, pursuant\r\nto the custom of the law, began the celebration of the feast of Easter on\r\nthe fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, not regarding whether the\r\nsame happened on a Saturday or any other day.… Thus it appears that you,\r\nColman, neither follow the example of John, as you imagine, nor that of\r\nPeter, whose traditions you knowingly contradict.… For John, keeping the\r\npaschal time according to the decree of the Mosaic law, had no regard to\r\nthe first day after the Sabbath [_i.e._, that it should fall on Sunday],\r\nand you who celebrate Easter only on the first day after the Sabbath do\r\nnot practise this. Peter kept Easter Sunday between the fifteenth and the\r\ntwenty-first day of the moon, and you do not do this, but keep Easter\r\nSunday from the fourteenth to the twentieth day of the moon, so that you\r\noften begin Easter on the thirteenth moon in the evening … besides this in\r\nyour celebration of Easter, you utterly exclude the twenty-first day of\r\nthe moon, which the law ordered to be especially observed.”\r\n\r\nTo this Colman rejoined: “Did Anatolius, a holy man, and much commended in\r\necclesiastical history, act contrary to the Law and the Gospel when he\r\nwrote that Easter was to be celebrated from the fourteenth to the\r\ntwentieth? Is it to be believed that our most reverend Father Columba and\r\nhis successors, men beloved of God, who kept Easter after the same manner,\r\nthought or acted contrary to the divine writings? Whereas there were many\r\namong them whose sanctity was attested by heavenly signs and the workings\r\nof miracles, whose life, customs, discipline I never cease to follow, not\r\nquestioning that they are saints in heaven.”\r\n\r\nWilfrid said: “It is evident that Anatolius was a most holy and learned\r\nand commendable man; but what have you to do with him, since you do not\r\nobserve his decrees? For he, following the rule of truth in his Easter,\r\nappointed a cycle of nineteen years, which you are either ignorant of, or\r\nif you know yet despise, though it is kept by the whole Church of Christ.…\r\nConcerning your Father Columba and his followers … I do not deny that they\r\nwere God’s servants, and beloved by Him, who, with rustic simplicity but\r\npious intentions, have themselves loved Him.… But as for you and your\r\ncompanions, you certainly sin, if, having heard the decrees of the\r\nApostolic See, or rather of the universal Church, and the same confirmed\r\nby Holy Scripture, you refuse to follow them. For though your Fathers were\r\nholy, do you think that their small number in a corner of the remotest\r\nisland is to be preferred before the universal Church of Christ throughout\r\nthe world? And if that Columba of yours (and, I may say, ours also, if he\r\nwas Christ’s servant) was a holy man and powerful in miracles, yet could\r\nhe be preferred before the most blessed prince of the Apostles, to whom\r\nour Lord said: ‘Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,\r\nand the gates of hell shall not prevail against it, and to thee I will\r\ngive the keys of the kingdom of heaven’?”\r\n\r\nWhen Wilfrid had thus spoken, the king said: “Is it true, Colman, that\r\nthese words were spoken to Peter by our Lord?” He answered: “It is true, O\r\nking.” Then he said: “Can you show any such power given to your Columba?”\r\nColman answered: “None.” Then the king added: “Do you both agree that\r\nthese words were principally directed to Peter, and that the keys of\r\nheaven were given to him by our Lord?” They both answered: “We do.” Then\r\nthe king concluded: “And I also say unto you that he is the doorkeeper\r\nwhom I will not contradict, but will, as far as I know and am able in all\r\nthings, obey his decrees, lest, when I come to the gates of the kingdom of\r\nheaven, there should be one to open them, he being my adversary who is\r\nproved to have the keys.” The king having said this, all present, both\r\nsmall and great, gave their assent, and renounced the more imperfect\r\ninstitution, and resolved to conform to that which they found to be\r\nbetter.… [ch. 26]. Colman, perceiving that his doctrine was rejected and\r\nhis sect despised, took with him such as would not comply with the\r\nCatholic Easter and the tonsure (for there was much controversy about that\r\nalso) and went back to Scotland to consult with his people what was to be\r\ndone in this case. Cedd, forsaking the practices of the Scots, returned to\r\nhis bishopric, having submitted to the Catholic observance of Easter. This\r\ndisputation happened in the year of our Lord’s incarnation, 664.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Bede, _Hist. Ec._, IV, 5. (MSL, 95:180.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Council of Hertford A. D. 673. The organization of the\r\n    Anglo-Saxon Church by Theodore.\r\n\r\n\r\n    As the important synod of Whitby marks the beginning of conformity\r\n    of the Anglo-Saxon Church under the leadership of the kingdom of\r\n    Northumbria to the customs of the Roman Church, so the synod of\r\n    Hertford brings the internal organization of the Church into\r\n    conformity with the diocesan system of the Continent and of the\r\n    East, where the principles of the general councils were at this\r\n    time most completely enforced. Theodore of Canterbury was a\r\n    learned Greek who was sent to England to be archbishop of\r\n    Canterbury by Pope Vitalian in 668. The Council of Hertford was\r\n    the first council of all the Church among the Anglo-Saxons. For\r\n    the council, see also Haddan and Stubbs, _Councils and\r\n    Ecclesiastical Documents_, III, 118-122. The text given is that of\r\n    Plummer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the name of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, in the perpetual\r\nreign of the same Lord Jesus Christ and His government of His Church. It\r\nseemed good that we should come together according to the prescription of\r\nthe venerable canons, to treat of the necessary affairs of the Church. We\r\nare met together on this 24th day of September, the first indiction in the\r\nplace called Hertford. I, Theodore, although unworthy, appointed by the\r\nApostolic See bishop of the church of Canterbury, and our fellow priest\r\nthe most reverend Bisi, bishop of the East Angles, together with our\r\nbrother and fellow bishop Wilfrid, bishop of the nation of the\r\nNorthumbrians, present by his proper legates, as also our brethren and\r\nfellow bishops, Putta, bishop of the Castle of the Kentishmen called\r\nRochester, Leutherius, bishop of the West Saxons, and Winfrid, bishop of\r\nthe province of the Mercians, were present. When we were assembled and had\r\ntaken our places, each according to his rank, I said: I beseech you,\r\nbeloved brethren, for the fear and love of our Redeemer, that we all labor\r\nin common for our faith, that whatsoever has been decreed and determined\r\nby the holy and approved Fathers may be perfectly followed by us all. I\r\nenlarged upon these and many other things tending unto charity and the\r\npreservation of the unity of the Church. And when I had finished my speech\r\nI asked them singly and in order whether they consented to observe all\r\nthings which had been canonically decreed by the Fathers? To which all our\r\nfellow priests answered: We are all well agreed readily and most\r\ncheerfully to keep whatever the canons of the holy Fathers have\r\nprescribed. Whereupon I immediately produced the book of canons,(260) and\r\npointed out ten chapters from the same book, which I had marked, because I\r\nknew that they were especially necessary for us, and proposed that they\r\nshould be diligently observed by all, namely:\r\n\r\nCh. 1. That we shall jointly observe Easter day on the Lord’s day after\r\nthe fourteenth day of the moon in the first month.\r\n\r\nCh. 2. That no bishop invade the diocese of another, but be content with\r\nthe government of the people committed to him.\r\n\r\nCh. 3. That no bishop be allowed to trouble in any way any monasteries\r\nconsecrated to God, nor to take away by violence anything that belongs to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCh. 4. That the monks themselves go not from place to place; that is, from\r\none monastery to another, without letters dismissory of their own\r\nabbot;(261) but that they shall continue in that obedience which they\r\npromised at the time of their conversion.\r\n\r\nCh. 5. That no clerk, leaving his own bishop, go up and down at his own\r\npleasure, nor be received wherever he comes, without commendatory letters\r\nfrom his bishop; but if he be once received and refuse to return when he\r\nis desired so to do, both the receiver and the received shall be laid\r\nunder an excommunication.\r\n\r\nCh. 6. That stranger bishops and clerks be content with the hospitality\r\nthat is freely offered them; and none of them be allowed to exercise any\r\nsacerdotal function without permission of the bishop in whose diocese he\r\nis known to be.\r\n\r\nCh. 7. That a synod be assembled twice in the year. But, because many\r\noccasions may hinder this, it was jointly agreed by all that once in the\r\nyear it be assembled on the first of August in the place called Clovesho.\r\n\r\nCh. 8. That no bishop ambitiously put himself before another, but that\r\nevery one observe the time and order of his consecration.\r\n\r\nCh. 9. The ninth chapter was discussed together: That the number of\r\nbishops be increased as the number of the faithful grew;(262) but we did\r\nnothing as to this point at present.\r\n\r\nCh. 10. As to marriages: That none shall be allowed to any but what is a\r\nlawful marriage. Let none commit incest. Let none relinquish his own wife\r\nbut for fornication, as the holy Gospel teaches. But if any have dismissed\r\na wife united to him in lawful marriage, let him not be joined to another\r\nif he wish really to be a Christian, but remain as he is or be reconciled\r\nto his own wife.\r\n\r\nAfter we had jointly treated on and discussed these chapters, that no\r\nscandalous contention should arise henceforth by any of us, and that there\r\nbe no changes in the publication of them, it seemed proper that every one\r\nshould confirm by the subscription of his own hand whatever had been\r\ndetermined. I dictated this our definitive sentence to be written by\r\nTitillus, the notary. Done in the month and indiction above noted.\r\nWhosoever, therefore, shall attempt in any way to oppose or infringe this\r\nsentence, confirmed by our present consent, and the subscription of our\r\nhands as agreeable to the decrees of the canons, let him know that he is\r\ndeprived of every sacerdotal function and our society. May the divine\r\ngrace preserve us safe living in the unity of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Bede, _Hist. Ec._, IV, 17. (MSL, 95:198.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Council of Hatfield, A. D. 680.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At the Council of Hatfield the Anglo-Saxon Church formally\r\n    recognized the binding authority of the five general councils\r\n    already held, and rejected Monotheletism in accord with the Roman\r\n    synod A. D. 649. It seems to have been, as stated in the\r\n    introduction to the Acts of the council, a preventive measure. In\r\n    Plummer’s edition of Bede this chapter is numbered 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Theodore, hearing that the faith of the Church of\r\nConstantinople had been much disturbed by the heresy of Eutyches,(263) and\r\nbeing desirous that the churches of the English over which he ruled should\r\nbe free from such a stain, having collected an assembly of venerable\r\npriests and very many doctors, diligently inquired what belief they each\r\nheld, and found unanimous agreement of all in the Catholic faith; and this\r\nhe took care to commit to a synodical letter for the instruction and\r\nremembrance of posterity. This is the beginning of the letter:\r\n\r\nIn the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in the reign of our most\r\npious lords, Egfrid, king of the Humbrians, in the tenth year of his\r\nreign, on the fifteenth day before the Kalends of October [September 17]\r\nin the eighth indiction, and Ethelred, king of the Mercians, in the sixth\r\nyear of his reign; and Adwulf, king of the Kentishmen, in the seventh year\r\nof his reign; Theodore being president, by the grace of God, archbishop of\r\nthe island of Britain and of the city of Canterbury, and other venerable\r\nmen sitting with him, bishops of the island of Britain, with the holy\r\nGospels laid before them, and in the place which is called by the Saxon\r\nname of Hatfield, we, handling the subject in concert, have made an\r\nexposition of the right and orthodox faith, as our incarnate Lord Jesus\r\nChrist delivered it to His disciples, who saw Him present and heard His\r\ndiscourses, and as the creed of the holy Fathers has delivered it, and all\r\nthe holy and universal synods and all the chorus of approved doctors of\r\nthe Catholic Church teach. We therefore piously and orthodoxly following\r\nthem and, making our profession according to their divinely inspired\r\nteaching, believe in unison with it, and confess according to the holy\r\nFathers that the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are properly and\r\ntruly a consubstantial Trinity in unity, and unity in Trinity; that is, in\r\none God in three consubstantial subsistencies or persons of equal glory\r\nand honor.\r\n\r\nAnd after many things of this kind that pertained to the confession of the\r\nright faith, the holy synod also adds these things to its letter:\r\n\r\nWe have received as holy and universal five synods of the blessed Fathers\r\nacceptable to God; that is, of the three hundred and eighteen assembled at\r\nNicæa against the most impious Arius and his tenets; and of the one\r\nhundred and fifty at Constantinople against the madness of Macedonius and\r\nEudoxius and their tenets; and of the two hundred in the first Council of\r\nEphesus against the most wicked Nestorius and his tenets; and of the six\r\nhundred and thirty at Chalcedon against Eutyches and Nestorius and their\r\ntenets; and again of those assembled in a fifth council at Constantinople\r\n[A. D. 553], in the time of the younger Justinian, against Theodore and\r\nthe epistles of Theodoret and Ibas and their tenets against Cyril.\r\n\r\nAnd a little after: Also we have received the synod(264) that was held in\r\nthe city of Rome in the time of the blessed Pope Martin in the eighth\r\nindiction, in the ninth year of the reign of the most pious\r\nConstantine.(265) And we glorify our Lord Jesus Christ as they glorified\r\nHim, neither adding nor subtracting anything; and we anathematize with\r\nheart and mouth those whom they anathematized; and those whom they\r\nreceived we receive, glorifying God the Father without beginning, and his\r\nonly begotten Son, begotten of the Father before the world began, and the\r\nHoly Ghost proceeding ineffably from the Father and the Son, as those holy\r\nApostles, prophets, and doctors have declared whom we have mentioned\r\nabove. And we all who with Theodore have made an exposition of the\r\nCatholic faith have subscribed hereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. The Foundation Of The Ecclesiastical Institutions Of The\r\nMiddle Ages\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the period between the conversion of the Franks and the rise of the\r\ndynasty of Charles Martel, or the period comprising the sixth and seventh\r\ncenturies, the foundation was laid for those ecclesiastical institutions\r\nwhich are peculiar to the Middle Ages, and found in the mediæval Church\r\ntheir full embodiment. In the Church the Latin element was still more or\r\nless dominant, and society was only slowly transformed by the Germanic\r\nelements. In the adjustment of Roman institutions to the new political\r\nconditions in which Germanic factors were dominant, the Germanic and the\r\nRoman elements are accordingly found in constantly varying proportions. In\r\nthe case of the diocesan and parochial organization, only very slowly\r\ncould the Church in the West attain that complete organization which had\r\nlong since been established in the East, and here Roman ideas were\r\nprofoundly modified by Germanic legal principles (§ 101). But at the same\r\ntime the Church’s body of teaching and methods of moral training were made\r\nclearly intelligible and more applicable to the new conditions of\r\nChristian life. The teaching of Augustine was received only in part at the\r\nCouncil of Orange, A. D. 529 (_v. supra_, § 85), and it was profoundly\r\nmodified by the moralistic type of theology traceable to Tertullian and\r\neven further back (_v. supra_, § 39). It was, furthermore, completed by a\r\nclearer and more precise statement of the doctrines of purgatory and the\r\nsacrifice of the mass, and to the death of Christ was applied\r\nunequivocally the doctrine of merit which had been developed in the West\r\nin connection with the early penitential discipline, and which was seen to\r\nthrow a new light upon the sacrifice of Christ upon the cross. These\r\nconceptions served as a foundation for new discussions, and confirmed\r\ntendencies already present in the Church (§ 102). Connected with this\r\ntheology was the penitential discipline, which, growing out of the ancient\r\ndiscipline as modified by the earlier form of monastic life, especially in\r\nIreland, came under the influence of the Germanic legal conceptions (§\r\n103). In the same period monasticism was organized upon a new rule by\r\nBenedict of Nursia (§ 104), and the need of provision for the education of\r\nthe young and for the training of the clergy was felt and, to some extent,\r\nprovided for by monastery schools and other methods of education (§ 105).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 101. Foundation of the Mediæval Diocesan and Parochial Constitution\r\n\r\n\r\nAn outline of some of the legislation is here given, whereby the parish as\r\norganized in the West was built up, and the diocese was made to consist of\r\na number of parishes under the bishop, who, however, did not exercise an\r\nabsolute control over the incomes and position of the priests under him.\r\n\r\nThe selections are given in chronological order.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Council of Agde, A. D. 506, _Canons_. Bruns, II, 145.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is one of the most important councils of the period. Its\r\n    various canons have all been embodied in the Canon Law; for the\r\n    references to the Decretum of Gratian, in which they appear, see\r\n    Hefele, § 222. It is to be noted that it was held under Alarich,\r\n    the Arian king of the Visigoths. The preface is, therefore, given\r\n    as being significant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this holy synod has been assembled in the name of the Lord and with\r\nthe permission of our most glorious, magnificent, and most pious king in\r\nthe city of Agde, there, with knees bent and on the ground, we have prayed\r\nfor his kingdom, his long life, for the people, that the lord who has\r\ngiven us permission to assemble, may happily extend his kingdom, that he\r\nmay govern justly and protect valiantly; we have assembled in the basilica\r\nof St. Andrew to treat of the discipline and the ordination of pontiffs\r\nand other things of utility to the Church.\r\n\r\nCanon 21. If any one wishes to have an oratory in the fields outside of\r\nthe parishes, in which the gathering of the people is lawful and\r\nappointed, we permit him to have a mass there with the proper license on\r\nthe other festivals, on account of the weariness of the family [_i.e._, in\r\ngoing to the distant parish church], but on Easter, Christmas, Epiphany,\r\nAscension Day, Pentecost and the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, or if\r\nthere are any other very high festival days observed, let them hold no\r\nmasses except in the cities and parishes. But if the clergy, without the\r\ncommand or permission of the bishop, hold and perform the masses on the\r\nfestivals above mentioned in the oratories, let them be driven from the\r\ncommunion.\r\n\r\nCanon 30. Because it is appropriate that the service of the Church be\r\nobserved in the same way by all, it is to be desired that it be done so\r\neverywhere. After the antiphones the collects shall be said in order by\r\nthe bishops and presbyters, and the hymns of Matins and Vespers be sung\r\ndaily; and at the conclusion of the mass of Matins and Vespers,(266) after\r\nthe hymns a chapter of the Psalms shall be read, and the people who are\r\ngathered shall, after the prayer, be dismissed with a benediction of the\r\nbishop until Vespers.\r\n\r\nCanon 38. Without letters commendatory of their bishops, it is not\r\npermitted to the clergy to travel. The same rule is to be observed in the\r\ncase of monks. If reproof of words does not correct them, we decree that\r\nthey shall be beaten with rods. It is also to be observed in the case of\r\nmonks that it is not permitted them to leave the community for solitary\r\ncells, unless the more severe rule is remitted by their abbot to them who\r\nhave been approved in the hermit life, or on account of the necessity of\r\ninfirmity; but only then let it be done so that they remain within the\r\nwalls of the same monastery, and they are permitted to have separate cells\r\nunder the authority of the abbots. It is not permitted abbots to have\r\ndifferent cells or many monasteries, or except on account of the inroads\r\nof enemies to erect dwellings within walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) I Council of Orleans, A. D. 511, _Canons_. Bruns, II, 160.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 15. Concerning those things which in the form of lands, vineyards,\r\nslaves, and other property the faithful have given to the parishes, the\r\nstatutes of the ancient canons are to be observed, so that all things\r\nshall be in the control of the bishop; but of those things which are given\r\nat the altar, a third is to be faithfully given to the bishop.\r\n\r\nCanon 17. All churches which in various places have been built and are\r\ndaily being built shall, according to the law of the primitive canons, be\r\nin the control of the bishop in whose territory they are located.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) IV Council of Orleans, A. D. 541, _Canons_. Bruns, II, 208.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 7. In oratories on landed estates, the lords of the property shall\r\nnot install wandering clergy against the will of the bishop to whom the\r\nrights of that territory belong, unless, perchance, they have been\r\napproved, and the bishop has in his discretion appointed them to serve in\r\nthat place.\r\n\r\nCanon 26. If any parishes are established in the houses of the mighty, and\r\nthe clergy who serve there have been admonished by the archdeacon of the\r\ncity, according to the duty of his office, and they neglect to do what\r\nthey ought to do for the Church, because under the protection of the lord\r\nof the house, let them be corrected according to the ecclesiastical\r\ndiscipline; and if by the agents of these lords, or by these lords\r\nthemselves of the place, they are prevented from doing any part of their\r\nduty toward the Church, those who do this iniquity are to be deprived of\r\nthe sacred rites until, having made amends, they are received back into\r\nthe peace of the Church.(267)\r\n\r\nCanon 33. If any one has, or asks to have, on his land a diocese [_i.e._,\r\nparish], let him first assign to it sufficient lands and clergy who may\r\nthere perform their duties, that suitable reverence be done to the sacred\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) V Council of Orleans, A. D. 549, _Canons_. Bruns, II, 208.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At this council no less than seven archbishops, forty-three\r\n    bishops and representatives of twenty-one other bishops were\r\n    present. It was, therefore, a general council of the Frankish\r\n    Church, although politically the Frankish territory was divided\r\n    into three kingdoms held respectively by Childebert, Chlothar, and\r\n    Theudebald. Orleans itself was in the dominion of Childebert.\r\n    _Cf._ preface to the canons of II Orleans, A. D. 533, which states\r\n    that that council was attended by five archbishops and the deputy\r\n    of a sixth, as well as by bishops from all parts of Gaul, and was\r\n    called at the command of the “Glorious kings,” _i.e._, Childebert,\r\n    Chlothar, and Theudebert.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 13. It is permitted to no one to retain, alienate, or take away\r\ngoods or property which has been lawfully given to a church, monastery, or\r\norphan asylums for any charity; that if any one does do so he shall,\r\naccording to the ancient canons [_cf._ Hefele, §§ 220, 222], be regarded\r\nas a slayer of the poor, and shall be shut out from the thresholds of the\r\nChurch so long as those things are not restored which have been taken away\r\nor retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Council of Braga, A. D. 572, _Canons_. Bruns, II, 37.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 5. As often as bishops are requested by any of the faithful to\r\nconsecrate churches, they shall not, as having a claim, ask any payment of\r\nthe founders; but if he wishes to give him something from a vow he has\r\nmade, let it not be despised; but if poverty or necessity prevent him, let\r\nnothing be demanded of him. This only let each bishop remember, that he\r\nshall not dedicate a church or basilica before he shall have received the\r\nendowment of the basilica and its service confirmed by an instrument of\r\ndonation; for it is a not light rashness for a church to be consecrated,\r\nas if it were a private dwelling, without lights and without the support\r\nof those who are to serve there.\r\n\r\nCanon 6. In case of any one who builds a basilica, not from any faithful\r\ndevotion, but from the desire of gain, that whatsoever is there gathered\r\nof the offerings of the people he may share half and half with the clergy,\r\non the ground that he has built the basilica on his own land, which in\r\nvarious places is said to be done quite constantly, this therefore ought\r\nhereafter to be observed, that no bishop consent to such an abominable\r\npurpose, that he should dare to consecrate a basilica which is founded not\r\nas the heritage of the saints but rather under the condition of tribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) II Council of Toledo, A. D. 589, _Canons_. Bruns, I, 217.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 19. Many who have built churches demand that these churches,\r\ncontrary to the canons, shall be consecrated in such a way that they shall\r\nnot allow the endowment, which they have given the church, to belong to\r\nthe control of the bishop; when this has been done in the past, let this\r\nbe void, and in the future forbidden; but let all things pertain to the\r\npower and control of the bishop according to the ancient law.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 102. Western Piety and Thought in the Period of the Conversion of the\r\nBarbarians\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the century following Augustine, the dogmatic interest of the Church\r\nwas chiefly absorbed in the Christological controversies in the East.\r\nThere were, however, some discussions in the West arising from the\r\nmanifest difficulty of reconciling the doctrine of predestination, as\r\ndrawn from Augustine, with the efficacy of baptism. For the adjustment of\r\nthe teaching of Augustine to the sacramental system of the Church and to\r\nbaptism more particularly, see the Council of Orange, A. D. 529, of which\r\nthe principal conclusions are given above (§ 85). In the sixth century and\r\nin the early part of the seventh, doctrines were clearly enunciated which\r\nhad been abundantly foreshadowed by earlier writers, but had not been\r\nfitted into an intelligible and practical system. These were especially\r\nthe doctrine of purgatory and the sacrifice of the mass. The doctrine of\r\npurgatory completed the penitential system of the early Church by making\r\nit possible to expiate sin by suffering in a future existence, in the case\r\nof those who had died without completely doing penance here. By the\r\nsacrifice of the mass the advantages of Christ’s death were constantly\r\napplied, not merely to the sin of the world in general, but to specified\r\nobjects; the believer was brought into closest contact with the great act\r\nof redemption, and a centre was placed around which the life of the\r\nindividual and the authority of the hierarchy could be brought into\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: The works of Gregory the Great, PNF.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Cæsarius of Arles, _Sermon_ 104. (MSL, 39:1947, 1949.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cæsarius presided at the Council of Orange A. D. 529. He died in\r\n    543. Not a few of his sermons have been mixed up with those of\r\n    Augustine, and this sermon is to be found in Appendix to the works\r\n    of Augustine in the standard editions of that Father. It should be\r\n    noted that this conception of purgatory is not wholly unlike that\r\n    of St. Augustine; see his _Enchiridion_, chs. 69, 109 (_v. supra_,\r\n    § 84); also _De Civ. Dei_, 20:25; 21:13.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 4. By continual prayers and frequent fasts and more generous alms, and\r\nespecially by forgiveness of those who sin against us, we diligently\r\nredeem our sins, lest by chance when collected together against us at once\r\nthey make a great mass and overwhelm us. Whatsoever of these sins shall\r\nnot have been redeemed by us is to be purged by that fire concerning which\r\nthe Apostle said: “Because it will be revealed by fire, and if any man’s\r\nwork is burned he will suffer loss” (I Cor. 3:15). If in tribulation we do\r\nnot give thanks to God, if by good works we do not redeem our sins, we\r\nwill remain so long in that fire of purification(268) until the little,\r\ntrifling sins, as hay, wood, and stubble are consumed.\r\n\r\nCh. 8. All saints who serve God truly strive to give themselves to reading\r\nand prayer, and to perseverance in good works, and building no mortal sins\r\nand no little sins, that is, wood, hay, and stubble, upon the foundation\r\nof Christ; but good works, that is, gold, silver, and precious stones,\r\nwill without injury go through that fire of which the Apostle spoke:\r\n“Because it will be revealed by fire.” But those who, although they do not\r\ncommit capital sins, yet are prone to commit very little sins and are\r\nnegligent in redeeming them, will attain to eternal life because they\r\nbelieved in Christ, but first either in this life they are purified by\r\nbitter tribulation, or certainly in that fire of which the Apostle speaks\r\nthey are to be tormented, that they may come to eternal life without spot\r\nor wrinkle. But those who have committed homicide, sacrilege, adultery and\r\nother similar sins, if there does not come to their aid suitable\r\npenitence, will not deserve to go through that fire of purification to\r\nlife, but they will be thrown into death by eternal fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Gregory the Great, _Dialogorum libri IV, de Vita et Miraculis Patrum\r\nItalicorum_, IV, 56. (MPL, 77:425.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sacrifice of the mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n    See also the selection below on the doctrine of purgatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be considered that it is safer to do to men, while one is\r\nliving, the good which one hopes will be done by others after one’s death.\r\nIt is more blessed to depart free than to seek liberty after chains. We\r\nought, with our whole mind, despise the present world, especially since we\r\nsee it already passing away. We ought to immolate to God the daily\r\nsacrifice of our tears, the daily offerings of His flesh and blood. For\r\nthis offering peculiarly preserves the soul from eternal death, and it\r\nrenews to us in a mystery the death of the Only begotten, who, although\r\nbeing risen from the dead, dieth no more, and death hath no more dominion\r\nover Him (Rom. 6:9); yet, while in Himself He liveth immortal and\r\nincorruptible, for us He is immolated again in this mystery of the sacred\r\noblation. For it is His body that is there given, His flesh that is\r\ndivided for the salvation of the people, His blood that is poured, no\r\nlonger into the hands of unbelievers, but into the mouths of the faithful.\r\nFor this let us ever estimate what this sacrifice is for us, which for our\r\nabsolution ever imitates the passion of the only begotten Son. For what\r\none of the faithful can have any doubt that at the very hour of the\r\noffering [_immolatio_], at the word of the priest, the heavens are opened,\r\nthe choirs of angels are present at the mystery of Jesus Christ, the\r\nlowest things are united to the highest, earthly things with heavenly, and\r\nfrom the invisible and the visible there is made one?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Gregory the Great, _Dialog._, IV, 39. (MSL, 77:393.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The doctrine of purgatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gregory hardly adds anything to Augustine more than a clearer\r\n    definition after the lines laid down by Cæsarius of Arles.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom these sayings [John 12:35; II Cor. 6:2; Eccles. 9:10] it is evident\r\nthat as one left the earth so one will appear before the judgment. Yet\r\nstill it is to be believed that for certain slight sins there is to be\r\nbefore that judgment a fire of purification, because the Truth says that,\r\nif one utters blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, his sin will be forgiven\r\nhim neither in this world nor in the future [Matt. 12:31]. From this\r\nsaying one is given to understand that some sins can be forgiven in this\r\nlife, others in a future life.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Gregory the Great, _In Evangelia_, II, 37, 8. (MSL, 76:1279.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The application of the sacrifice of the mass to persons in\r\n    purgatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long before our time the case is told of a certain man who, having\r\nbeen taken captive, was carried far away [_cf. Dialog._, IV, 57], and\r\nbecause he was held a long time in chains his wife, since she had not\r\nreceived him back from that captivity, believed him to be dead and every\r\nweek she had the sacrifice offered for him as already dead. And as often\r\nas the sacrifice was offered by his spouse for the absolution of his soul,\r\nthe chains were loosed in his captivity. For having returned a long time\r\nafter, greatly astonished he told his wife that on certain days each week\r\nhis chains were loosed. His wife considered the days and hours, and then\r\nknew that he was loosed when, as she remembered, the sacrifice was offered\r\nfor him. From that perceive, my dearest brothers, to what extent the holy\r\nsacrifice offered by us is able to loose the bonds of the heart, if the\r\nsacrifice offered by one for another can loose the chains of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 103. The Foundation of the Mediæval Penitential System\r\n\r\n\r\nThe penitential system, as it was organized in the Western Church in the\r\nsixth, seventh, and eighth centuries, was but the carrying out of\r\nprinciples which had appeared elsewhere in Christendom and were involved\r\nin the primitive method of dealing with moral delinquents by the\r\nauthorities of the Church. [See the epistles of Basil the Great to\r\nAmphilochius (Ep. 189, 199, 217) in PNF, ser. II, vol. VIII.] Similar\r\nproblems had to be handled everywhere whenever the Church came to deal\r\nwith moral conduct, and much the same solution was found everywhere. There\r\nis, however, no known connection between the earliest penitentials of the\r\nWestern Church, those of Ireland, and the similar books of the East. There\r\nis no need of supposing that there was a connection. But in the case of\r\nthe works attributed to Theodore of Tarsus, archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nhimself a Greek and probably a native of Tarsus, there is a provable\r\nconnection which is evident to any one reading his work, as he refers to\r\nBasil and others. The characteristics of the Western penitentials are\r\ntheir minute division of sins, their exact determination of penances for\r\neach sin, and the great extent to which they were used in the practical\r\nwork of the Church. They serve as the first crude beginnings of a moral\r\ntheology of a practical character, such as would be needed by the poorly\r\ntrained parish clergy of the times in dealing with their flocks. On\r\naccount of the nature of these works, it is hardly necessary or expedient\r\nto give more than a few brief extracts in addition to references to\r\nsources. Much of the matter is extremely offensive to modern taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) King Æthelberht, _Laws_. Thorpe, _Ancient Laws and Institutes_\r\n(Rolls Series), 1 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Early Germanic Codes are full of regulations whereby for an\r\n    injury the aggrieved party, or his family in case of his death,\r\n    could be prevented from retaliating in kind upon the aggressor and\r\n    his family. This was effected by a money payment as compensation\r\n    for damages sustained, and the amount for each sort of injury was\r\n    carefully regulated by law, _i.e._, by ancient custom, which was\r\n    reduced to writing in the sixth century in some cases. The _Laws\r\n    of Æthelberht_ are written in Anglo-Saxon and are probably the\r\n    earliest in a Teutonic language. For a translation of\r\n    characteristic portions of the _Salic Law_, which should be\r\n    compared with the _Laws of Æthelberht_ to show the universality of\r\n    the same system, see Henderson, _Select Historical Documents of\r\n    the Middle Ages_, p. 176, London, 1892; also Hodgkin, _Italy and\r\n    Her Invaders_, VI, 183, for the Lombard law of Rothari, a little\r\n    later, but of the same spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. If any man slay another, let him make bot with a half leod-geld of 100\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\n22. If any man slay another at an open grave, let him pay 20 shillings and\r\npay the whole leod within 40 days.\r\n\r\n23. If a stranger retire from the land, let his kindred pay a half leod.\r\n\r\n24. If any one bind a freeman, let him make bot with 20 shillings.\r\n\r\n25. If any one slay a ceorl’s hlaf-aeta,(269) let him make bot with 5\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\n38. If a shoulder be lamed,(270) let bot be made with 12 shillings.\r\n\r\n39. If the ear be struck off, let bot be made with 12 shillings.\r\n\r\n40. If the other ear hear not, let bot be made with 25 shillings.\r\n\r\n41. If an eye be struck out, let bot be made with 50 shillings.\r\n\r\n51. For each of the four front teeth, 6 shillings; for the tooth that\r\nstands next to them, 4 shillings; for that which stands next to that, 3\r\nshillings, and then afterward 1 shilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Vinnian, _Penitential_. Wasserschleben, _Die Bussordnungen der\r\nabendländischen Kirche_, 108 _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is one of the earliest of the penitentials and belongs to the\r\n    Irish Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If one has committed in his heart a sin of thought and immediately\r\nrepents of it, let him smite his breast and pray God for forgiveness and\r\nperform satisfaction because he has sinned.\r\n\r\n2. If he has often thought of the sins and thinks of committing them, and\r\nis then victor over the thought or is overcome by it, let him pray God and\r\nfast day and night until the wicked thought disappears and he is sound\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n3. If he has thought on a sin and determines to commit it, but is\r\nprevented in the execution, so is the sin the same, but not the\r\npenance.(271)\r\n\r\n6. If a cleric has planned in his heart to smite or kill his neighbor, he\r\nshall do penance half a year on bread and water according to the\r\nprescribed amount, and for a whole year abstain from wine and the eating\r\nof meat, and then may he be permitted again to approach the altar.\r\n\r\n7. If it is a layman, he shall do penance for a whole week; for he is a\r\nman of this world and his guilt is lighter in this world and his\r\npunishment in the future is less.\r\n\r\n8. If a cleric has smitten his brother [_i.e._, a clergyman] or his\r\nneighbor and drawn blood … he shall do penance a whole year on bread and\r\nwater; he may not fill any clerical office, but must with tears pray to\r\nGod for himself.\r\n\r\n9. Is he a layman, he shall do penance for 40 days, and according to the\r\njudgment of the priest or some other righteous man pay a determined sum of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Theodore of Tarsus, _Penitential_, I.

That he wrote a penitential is\r\n    not certain. But that he was regarded as the author of a\r\n    penitential is clear enough. In fact, his name is attached to\r\n    penitentials in much the same way as David’s name is attached to\r\n    the whole book of Psalms. For a discussion of the various works\r\n    attributed to Theodore, see Haddan and Stubbs, _Councils and\r\n    Ecclesiastical Documents_, _loc. cit._ This is a characteristic\r\n    penitential and may be regarded as following closely the decisions\r\n    and opinions of Theodore. Much of it is unprintable in English.\r\n\r\n\r\nCap. I. _On drunkenness._ 1. If any bishop or other person ordained is\r\ncustomarily given to the vice of drunkenness, let him cease from it or be\r\ndeposed.\r\n\r\n2. If a monk vomit from drunkenness, let him do 30 days’ penance.\r\n\r\n3. If a presbyter or deacon do the same, let him do 40 days’ penance.\r\n\r\n4. If any one by infirmity or because he has abstained for a long time,\r\nand it is not his habit to drink or eat much, or for joy at Christmas or\r\nat Easter, or for the commemoration of any of the saints, does this, and\r\nhe has not taken more than is decreed by the elders, he has done no wrong.\r\nIf the bishop should have commanded, he does no harm to him unless he\r\nhimself does likewise.\r\n\r\n5. If a believing layman vomits from drunkenness, let him do 15 days’\r\npenance.\r\n\r\n6. He who becomes drunk against the commandment of the Lord, if he has a\r\nvow of holiness let him do penance 7 days on bread and water, and 70 days\r\nwithout fat; the laity without beer.\r\n\r\n7. Whoever out of malice makes another drunk, let him do penance 40 days.\r\n\r\n8. Whoever vomits from satiety let him do penance 3 days.\r\n\r\n9. If with the sacrifice of the communion, let him do penance 7 days; but\r\nif out of infirmity, he is without guilt.\r\n\r\nCap. II. _On fornication._\r\n\r\nCap. III. _On theft._\r\n\r\nCap. IV. _On the killing of men._ [This should be compared with the\r\nsecular laws.]\r\n\r\n1. If any one out of vengeance for a relative kill a man, let him do\r\npenance as for homicide 7 or 10 years. If, however, he is willing to\r\nreturn to relatives the money of valuation [Weregeld, according to the\r\nsecular rating], the penance will be lighter, that is by one-half the\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n2. He who kills a man for vengeance for his brother, let him do penance 3\r\nyears; in another place he is said to do penance 10 years.\r\n\r\n3. But homicides 10 or 7 years.\r\n\r\n4. If a layman kills another man with thoughts of hatred, if he does not\r\nwish to relinquish his arms, let him do penance 7 years, without flesh and\r\nwine 3 years.\r\n\r\n5. If any one kills a monk or a clergyman, let him relinquish his arms and\r\nserve God(272) or do 7 years’ penance. He is in the judgment of the\r\nbishop. But he who kills a bishop or a presbyter, the judgment concerning\r\nhim is in the king.\r\n\r\n6. He who by the command of his lord kills a man, let him keep away from\r\nthe church 40 days; and he who kills a man in a public war, let him do\r\npenance 40 days.\r\n\r\n7. If out of wrath, 3 years; if by chance, 1 year; if by drink or any\r\ncontrivance, 4 years or more; if by strife, let him do penance 10\r\nyears.(273)\r\n\r\nCap.

Haddan and Stubbs, _Councils and\r\nEcclesiastical Documents_, III, 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Penitential of Bede is to be distinguished from the _Liber de\r\n    Remediis Peccatorum_ attributed to him, _cf._ Haddan and Stubbs,\r\n    _op. cit._, who print the genuine penitential. It belongs to the\r\n    period before 725. In not a few points it closely resembles that\r\n    of Theodore. The concluding passage here given is to be found in\r\n    many penitentials with but little variation. It is probably as\r\n    early as the work itself, although apparently not by Bede. It is a\r\n    method of commuting penances. In place of fasting inordinate or\r\n    impossible lengths of time, other penances could be substituted.\r\n    In later ages still other forms of commutation were introduced.\r\n    Even money payments were used as commutation of penance.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. _On Counsel to be Given._\r\n\r\nWe read in the penitential of doing penance on bread and water, for the\r\ngreat sins one year or two or three years, and for little sins a month or\r\na week. Likewise in the case of some the conditions are harsh and\r\ndifficult. Therefore to him who cannot do these things we give the counsel\r\nthat psalms, prayers, and almsgiving ought to be performed some days in\r\npenance for these; that is, that psalms are for one day when he ought to\r\ndo penance on bread and water. Therefore he should sing fifty psalms on\r\nhis knees, and if not on his knees seventy psalms inside the church or in\r\none place. For a week on bread and water, let him sing on his knees three\r\nhundred psalms in order and in the church or in one place. And for one\r\nmonth on bread and water, one thousand five hundred psalms kneeling, or if\r\nnot kneeling one thousand eight hundred and twenty, and afterward let him\r\nfast every day until the sixth hour and abstain from flesh and wine; but\r\nwhatsoever other food God has given him let him eat, after he has sung the\r\npsalms. And he who does not know psalms ought to do penance and to fast,\r\nand every day let him give to the poor the value of a denarius, and fast\r\none day until the ninth hour, and the next until vespers, and after that\r\nwhatsoever he has let him eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 104. The New Monasticism and the Rule of Benedict of Nursia\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first centuries of monasticism in the West, the greatest variety\r\nwas to be found among the constitutions of the various monastic houses and\r\nthe rules drawn up by great leaders in the ascetic movement. This variety\r\nextended even to the nature of the vows assumed and their obligation.\r\nBenedict of Nursia (circa 480 to circa 544), gave the rule according to\r\nwhich for some centuries nearly all the monasteries of the West were\r\nultimately organized. The first great example of this rule in operation\r\nwas Benedict’s own monastery at Monte Cassino. For a time the rule of\r\nBenedict came into conflict with that of Columbanus in Gaul.(274) But the\r\npowerful recommendation of Gregory the Great, who had introduced it in\r\nRome, and the intrinsic superiority of the rule itself made the\r\nBenedictine system triumphant. It should be noted that the Benedictine\r\ncloisters were for centuries independent establishments and only formed\r\ninto organized groups of monasteries in the great monastic reforms of the\r\ntenth and following centuries. It is a question how far the Benedictine\r\nrule was introduced into England in the early centuries of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nChurch, although it is often taken for granted that it was introduced by\r\nAugustine. Critical edition of the Benedictine rule by Wölfflin, Leipsic,\r\n1895; in Migne’s edition there is an elaborate commentary with many\r\nillustrative extracts and formulæ, as well as traditional glosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: An abbreviated translation of the\r\n    Benedictine rule may be found in Henderson, _Select Historical\r\n    Documents_, 1892, and in full in Thatcher and McNeal, _A Source\r\n    Book for Mediæval History_, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Benedict of Nursia, _Regula_. (MSL, 66:246.)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Concerning the kinds of monks and their modes of living._ It is\r\nmanifest that there are four kinds of monks. The first is that of the\r\ncenobites, that is the monastic, serving under a rule and an abbot. The\r\nsecond kind is that of the anchorites, that is the hermits, those who have\r\nlearned to fight against the devil, not by the new fervor of conversion,\r\nbut by a long probation in a monastery, having been taught already by\r\nassociation with many; and having been well prepared in the army of the\r\nbrethren for the solitary fight of the hermit, and secure now without the\r\nencouragement of another, they are able, God helping them, to fight with\r\ntheir own hand or arm against the vices of the flesh or of their thoughts.\r\nBut a third and very bad kind of monks are the sarabites, not tried as\r\ngold in the furnace by a rule, experience being their teacher, but\r\nsoftened after the manner of lead; keeping faith with the world by their\r\nworks, they are known by their tonsure to lie to God. Being shut up by\r\ntwos and threes alone and without a shepherd, in their own and not in the\r\nLord’s sheepfold, they have their own desires for a law. For whatever they\r\nthink good and choose, that they deem holy; and what they do not wish,\r\nthat they consider unlawful. But the fourth kind of monk is the kind\r\ncalled the _gyrovagi_, who during their whole life are guests for three or\r\nfour days at a time in the cells of different monasteries throughout the\r\nvarious provinces; they are always wandering and never stationary, serving\r\ntheir own pleasures and the allurements of the palate, and in every way\r\nworse than the sarabites. Concerning the most wretched way of all, it is\r\nbetter to keep silence than to speak. These things, therefore, being\r\nomitted, let us proceed with the aid of God to treat of the best kind, the\r\ncenobites.\r\n\r\n2. _What the abbot should be like._ An abbot who is worthy to preside over\r\na monastery ought always to remember what he is called and to carry out in\r\nhis deeds the name of a superior. For in the monastery he is believed to\r\nbe Christ’s representative, since he is called by His name, the Apostle\r\nsaying: “We have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry\r\nAbba, Father” [Rom. 8:15]. And so the abbot ought not (and oh that he may\r\nnot!) teach or decree or order anything apart from the precepts of the\r\nLord; but his order or teaching should be sprinkled with the leaven of\r\ndivine justice in the minds of his disciples.… No distinctions of persons\r\nshall be made by him in the monastery. One shall not be loved by him more\r\nthan another, unless the one whom he finds excelling in good work and\r\nobedience. A free-born man shall not be preferred to one coming from\r\nservitude, unless there be some reasonable cause. But when it is just and\r\nit seems good to the abbot he shall show preference no matter what the\r\nrank shall be. But otherwise they shall keep their own places; for,\r\nwhether we be bound or free, we are all one in Christ, and under God we\r\nperform an equal service of subjection; for God is no respecter of persons\r\n[Acts 10:34].…\r\n\r\n3. _Concerning calling the brethren to take counsel._ As often as anything\r\nunusual is to be done in the monastery, let the abbot call together the\r\nwhole congregation and himself explain the question before them. And\r\nhaving heard the advice of the brethren, he shall consider it by himself,\r\nand let him do what he judges most advantageous. And for this reason,\r\nmoreover, we have said that all ought to be called to take counsel;\r\nbecause it is often to a younger person that the Lord reveals what is\r\nbest. The brethren, moreover, ought, with all humble subjection, to give\r\ntheir advice so that they do not too boldly presume to defend what seems\r\ngood to them, but it should rather depend upon the judgment of the abbot;\r\nso that, whatever he decides upon as the more salutary, they should all\r\nagree to it.…\r\n\r\n4. _Concerning the instruments of good works._\r\n\r\n5. _Concerning obedience._ The first grade of humility is prompt\r\nobedience. This becomes those who, on account of the holy service which\r\nthey professed, or on account of the fear of hell or the glory of eternal\r\nlife, consider nothing dearer to them than Christ; so that as soon as\r\nanything is commanded by their superior, they may not know how to suffer\r\ndelay in doing it, even as if it were a divine command.…\r\n\r\n6. _Concerning silence._ 7. _Concerning humility._ 8. _Concerning the\r\nDivine Offices at night._ 9. _How many Psalms are to be said at night._\r\n10. _How in summer the Nocturnal Praises shall be carried on._ 11. _How\r\nVigils shall be conducted on Sunday._ 12. _Concerning the order of Matins\r\non Sunday._ 13. _Concerning the order of Matins on week days._ 14.\r\n_Concerning the order of Vigils on Saints’ days._ 15. _Concerning the\r\noccasions when the Alleluias shall be said._ 16. _Concerning the order of\r\nDivine Worship during the day._ 17. _On the number of Psalms to be said at\r\nthese times._ 18. _Concerning the order in which the Psalms are to be\r\nsaid._ 19. _Concerning the art of singing._ 20. _Concerning the reverence\r\nin prayer._ 21. _Concerning __ the Deans of monasteries._ 22. _How monks\r\nshall sleep._ 23. _Concerning excommunication for faults._ 24. _What ought\r\nto be the measure of excommunication._ 25. _Concerning graver faults._ 26.\r\n_Concerning those who without being ordered by the Abbot, associate with\r\nthe excommunicated._ 27. _What care the Abbot should exercise with regard\r\nto the excommunicated._ 28. _Concerning those who, being often rebuked, do\r\nnot amend._ 29. _Whether brothers who leave the monastery ought to be\r\nreceived back._ 30. _Concerning boys under age, how they should be\r\ncorrected._ 31. _Concerning the Cellarer of the monastery, what sort of\r\nperson he should be._ 32. _Concerning the utensils or property of the\r\nmonastery._\r\n\r\n33. _Whether monks should have anything of their own._ More than anything\r\nelse is this special vice to be cut off root and branch from the\r\nmonastery, that one should presume to give or receive anything without\r\norder from the abbot, or should have anything of his own; he should have\r\nabsolutely nothing, neither a book nor tablets nor a pen, nothing at\r\nall—for indeed it is not allowed to have their own bodies or wills in\r\ntheir own power. But all things necessary they must receive from the\r\nfather of the monastery; nor is it allowable to have anything which the\r\nabbot has not given or permitted.…\r\n\r\n34. _Whether all ought to receive necessaries equally._ 35. _Concerning\r\nthe weekly officers of the kitchen._ 36. _Concerning infirm brothers._ 37.\r\n_Mitigation of the rule for the very old and the very young._ 38.\r\n_Concerning the weekly reader._\r\n\r\n39. _Concerning the amount of food._ We believe, moreover, that for the\r\ndaily refection of the sixth and for that of the ninth hour as well two\r\ncooked dishes, on account of the infirmities of the different ones, are\r\nenough in all months for all tables; so that whoever, perchance, cannot\r\neat of one may partake of the other. Therefore let two cooked dishes\r\nsuffice for all the brethren; and if it is possible to obtain apples or\r\nfresh vegetables, a third may be added. One full pound of bread shall\r\nsuffice for a day, whether there be one refection or breakfast and supper.\r\nBut if they are to have supper, the third part of that same pound shall be\r\nreserved by the cellarer to be given back to those when they are about to\r\nsup. But if perchance some greater labor shall have been performed, it\r\nshall be in the will and power of the abbot, if it is expedient, to\r\nincrease anything.… But to younger boys the same quantity shall not be\r\nserved, but less than to the older ones, as moderation is to be observed\r\nin all things. But every one shall abstain altogether from eating the\r\nflesh of four-footed beasts except alone in the case of the weak and the\r\nsick.\r\n\r\n40. _Concerning the amount of drink._ Each one has his own gift from God,\r\none in this way and another in that. Therefore it is with some hesitation\r\nthat the amount of daily sustenance for others is fixed by us.\r\nNevertheless, considering the weakness of the infirm, we believe that a\r\nhalf pint of wine a day is enough for each one. Those, moreover, to whom\r\nGod has given the ability of enduring abstinence should know that they\r\nwill have their own reward. But the prior shall judge if either the needs\r\nof the place, or labor, or heat of the summer require more; considering,\r\nin all things, lest satiety or drunkenness creep in. Indeed, we read that\r\nwine is not suitable for monks at all. But, because in our times it is not\r\npossible to persuade monks of this, let us agree at least as to the fact\r\nthat we should not drink until we are sated, but sparingly. For wine can\r\nmake even the wise to go astray. Where, moreover, the limitations of the\r\nplace are such that the amount written above cannot be found, but much\r\nless or nothing at all, those who live there shall bless God and shall not\r\nmurmur. And we admonish them as to this, above all, that they be without\r\nmurmuring.\r\n\r\n41. _At what hours the brethren ought to take their refection._ 42. _That\r\nafter Compline no one shall speak._ 43. _Concerning those who come late to\r\nDivine Service or to table._ 44. _Concerning those who are excommunicated\r\nand how they shall render satisfaction._ 45. _Concerning those who make\r\nmistakes in the oratory._ 46. _Concerning those who err in other matters._\r\n47. _Concerning the announcement of the hour of Divine Service._\r\n\r\n48. _Concerning the daily manual labor._ Idleness is the enemy of the\r\nsoul. Therefore at fixed times the brethren ought to be occupied in manual\r\nlabor; and again at fixed times in sacred reading. Therefore we believe\r\nthat according to this disposition both seasons ought to be so arranged\r\nthat, from Easter until the first of October, going out early from the\r\nfirst until about the fourth hour, they shall labor at what might be\r\nnecessary. Moreover, from the fourth until about the sixth hour, they\r\nshall give themselves to reading. After the sixth hour, moreover, rising\r\nfrom table, they shall rest in their beds with all silence; or perchance\r\nhe that wishes to read may so read to himself that he shall not disturb\r\nanother. And nones shall be said rather early, about the middle of the\r\neighth hour; and again they shall work at what is necessary until vespers.\r\nBut if the exigency or the poverty of the place demands that they shall be\r\noccupied by themselves in picking fruits, they shall not be cast down; for\r\nthen they are truly monks if they live by the labor of their hands, as did\r\nalso our Fathers and the Apostles.\r\n\r\nFrom the first of October until the beginning of Lent, they shall give\r\nthemselves unto reading until the second full hour. At the second hour\r\ntierce shall be said, and all shall labor at the task which is enjoined\r\nupon them until the ninth. When the first signal of the ninth hour shall\r\nhave been given they shall each leave off his work and be ready when the\r\nsecond signal strikes. Moreover, after the refection they shall give\r\nthemselves to their reading or to the Psalms.\r\n\r\nAnd in the days of Lent, from dawn until the third full hour, they shall\r\ngive themselves to their reading; and until the tenth hour they shall do\r\nthe labor that is enjoined upon them. In the days of Lent they shall all\r\nreceive separate books from the library, which they shall read through\r\ncompletely in order; these books shall be given out on the first day of\r\nLent. Above all, there shall certainly be appointed one or two elders to\r\ngo around the monastery at the hours in which the brethren are engaged in\r\nreading and see to it that no troublesome brother is to be found who is\r\ngiven to idleness and chatting and is not intent upon his reading and is\r\nnot only of no use to himself but disturbing the others. If such an one\r\n(and may there not be such!) be found, he shall be admonished once and a\r\nsecond time. If he does not amend, he shall be subject under the rule to\r\nsuch punishment that others may fear. Nor shall the brethren assemble at\r\nunsuitable hours.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays all shall give themselves to reading except those who are\r\ndeputed to various duties. But if any one be so negligent and lazy that he\r\nwill not or cannot meditate or read, some task shall be imposed upon him\r\nwhich he can perform, so that he be not idle. On feeble and delicate\r\nbrothers such a labor or art is to be imposed that they shall neither be\r\nidle nor so oppressed by the burden of labor as to be driven to take to\r\nflight. Their weakness is to be taken into consideration by the abbot.\r\n\r\n49. _The observance of Lent._ 50. _Concerning brothers who labor far from\r\nthe oratory or are on a journey._ 51. _Concerning brothers who do not\r\njourney very far._ 52. _Concerning the oratory of the monastery._ 53.\r\n_Concerning the reception of guests._ 54. _As to whether a monk should be\r\nallowed to receive letters or anything._ 55. _Concerning the Vestiarius\r\nand Calciarius._ 56. _Concerning the table of the Abbot._ 57. _Concerning\r\nthe artificers of the monastery._\r\n\r\n58. _Concerning the manner of receiving brethren._ When any one newly\r\ncomes for conversion of life, an easy entrance shall not be granted him,\r\nbut as the Apostle says: “Try the spirits whether they be of God” [I John\r\n4:1]. Therefore if one who comes perseveres in knocking, and is seen after\r\nfour or five days to endure patiently the insults heaped upon him and the\r\ndifficulty of ingress and to persist in his request, let entrance be\r\ngranted him, and let him be for a few days in the guest cell. After this\r\nlet him be in the cell of the novices, where he shall meditate and eat and\r\nsleep. And an elder shall be appointed for him such as shall be capable of\r\nwinning souls, who shall altogether intently watch him, and be zealous to\r\nsee if he in truth seek God, if he be zealous for the work of God, for\r\nobedience, for suffering shame. And above all the harshness and roughness\r\nof the means through which one approaches God shall be told him in\r\nadvance. If he promise perseverance in his steadfastness after the lapse\r\nof two months, this Rule shall be read over to him in order, and it shall\r\nbe said to him: Behold the law under which thou didst wish to serve; if\r\nthou canst observe it, enter; but if thou canst not, depart freely. If he\r\nshall have stood firm thus far, then he shall be led into the aforesaid\r\ncell of the novices, and again he shall be proven with all patience.\r\n\r\nAnd after the lapse of six months, the Rule shall be reread to him, that\r\nhe may know upon what he is entering. And if he persist thus far, after\r\nfour months the same Rule shall still again be read to him. If, after\r\ndeliberating with himself, he shall promise that he will observe all\r\nthings and to obey all the commands laid upon him, then he shall be\r\nreceived into the congregation, knowing that it is decreed that by the law\r\nof the Rule he shall from that day not be allowed to depart from the\r\nmonastery, nor to shake free from his neck the yoke of the Rule, which\r\nafter such painful deliberation he was at liberty to refuse or receive.\r\n\r\nHe who is to be received shall make in the oratory, in the presence of\r\nall, a promise before God and His saints concerning his stability\r\n[_stabilitas loci_] and the change in the manner of his life [_conversio\r\nmorum_] and obedience [_obedientia_],(275) so that if at any time he act\r\ncontrary he shall know that he shall be condemned by Him whom he mocks.\r\nAnd concerning this, his promise, he shall make a petition addressed by\r\nname to the saints whose relics are there, and to the abbot who is\r\npresent. And this petition he shall write out with his own hand; or, if he\r\nbe really unlearned in letters, let another at his request write it, and\r\nto that the novice shall make his sign. With his own hand he shall place\r\nit upon the altar. And when he has placed it there, the novice shall\r\nimmediately begin this verse: “Receive me O Lord according to Thy promise\r\nand I shall live; and cast me not down from my hope” [Psalm 119:116,\r\nVulgate version]. And this verse the whole congregation shall repeat three\r\ntimes adding: Glory be to the Father, etc. Then that brother novice shall\r\nprostrate himself at the feet of each one that they may pray for him. And\r\nalready from that day he shall be considered as in the congregation.\r\n\r\nIf he have any property, he shall first either present it to the poor or,\r\nmaking a solemn donation, shall confer it on the monastery, receiving\r\nnothing at all for himself; and he shall know for a fact that from that\r\nday he shall have no power even over his own body. Immediately thereafter,\r\nin the monastery, he shall take off his own garments in which he was clad,\r\nand shall put on the garments of the monastery. Those garments,\r\nfurthermore, which he has taken off shall be placed in the vestiary to be\r\npreserved; so that if, at any time, on the devil’s persuasion, he shall\r\nwish to go forth from the monastery (and may it never happen) then, taking\r\noff the garments of the monastery let him be cast out. But the petition he\r\nmade and which the abbot took from upon the altar, he shall not receive\r\nagain, but it shall be preserved in the monastery.\r\n\r\n59. _Concerning the sons of nobles and poor men who are presented._ If by\r\nchance any one of the nobles offers his son to God in the monastery, and\r\nthe boy himself is a minor in age, his parents shall make the petition of\r\nwhich we have spoken above. And with an oblation, they shall wrap the\r\npetition and the hand of the boy in the linen cloth of the altar; and thus\r\nshall they offer him. Concerning their property, either they shall promise\r\nin the present petition, under an oath, that they will never, either\r\nindirectly or otherwise, give him anything at any time, or furnish him\r\nwith means of possessing it. Or, if they be unwilling to do this, and wish\r\nto offer something as alms to the monastery for their salvation, they\r\nshall make a donation of those things which they wish to give to the\r\nmonastery, retaining for themselves the usufruct if they so wish. And let\r\nall things be so observed that no suspicion may remain with the boy; by\r\nwhich, as we have learned from experience, being deceived, he might perish\r\n(and may it not happen). The poorer ones shall do likewise. Those who have\r\nnothing at all shall simply make their petitions; and with an oblation\r\nthey shall offer their sons before witnesses.\r\n\r\n60. _Concerning priests who may wish to dwell in the monastery._ 61.\r\n_Concerning pilgrim monks, how they are to be received._ 62. _Ordination\r\nof monks as priests._ 63. _Concerning rank in the congregation._ 64.\r\n_Concerning the ordination of an Abbot._ 65. _Concerning the Prior of the\r\nmonastery._ 66. _Concerning the Doorkeepers of the monastery._ 67.\r\n_Concerning brothers sent on a journey._ 68. _If impossibilities are\r\nimposed on a brother._ 69. _That in the monastery one shall not presume to\r\ndefend another._ 70. _That no one shall presume to strike another._ 71.\r\n_That they shall be obedient to one another._ 72. _Concerning the good\r\nzeal which monks ought to have._\r\n\r\n73. _Concerning the fact that not every just observance is decreed in this\r\nRule._ We have written down this Rule, that we may show those observing it\r\nin the monasteries how to have some honesty of character or beginning of\r\nconversion. But for those who hasten to the perfection of living, there\r\nare the teachings of the holy Fathers; the observance of which leads a man\r\nto the heights of perfection. For what page or what discourse of divine\r\nauthority in the Old or New Testament is not a more perfect rule of human\r\nlife? Or what book of the holy and Catholic Fathers does not trumpet forth\r\nhow by the right road we shall come to our Creator?\r\n\r\nAlso the reading aloud of the Fathers, and their decrees and lives; also\r\nthe Rule of our holy Father Basil—what else are they except instruments of\r\nvirtue for good living and obedient monks? But to us who are idle and evil\r\nlivers and negligent there is the blush of confusion. Thou, therefore,\r\nwhoever hastens to the heavenly fatherland, perform with Christ’s aid this\r\nRule written out as the least beginnings; and then at length, under God’s\r\nprotection, thou wilt come to the greater things that we have mentioned—to\r\nthe summits of teaching and virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Formulæ._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following _formulæ_ are given to illustrate the Rule in its working.\r\nThe first group bear upon the vow of _stabilitas loci_. The case not\r\ninfrequently arose that a brother wished to go to a monastery in which the\r\nobservance of the Rule was stricter. In case a new foundation was begun\r\nanywhere, the first monks were almost always from another monastery. If\r\ntherefore the monk is to remove, he must obtain permission of his abbot,\r\nand this was not regarded as a violation of the vow of _stabilitas loci_\r\nand obedience to his abbot. These _formulæ_ were not uniform throughout\r\nthe Church, but the following are given as samples of early practice.\r\n\r\n1. _Letters dimissory._ (MSL, 66:859.)\r\n\r\n(_a_) To all bishops and all orders of the holy Church, and to all\r\nfaithful people.\r\n\r\nBe it known unto you that I have given license to this our brother, John\r\nor Paul by name, that where he finds it agreeable to dwell in order to\r\nlead the monastic life, he shall have license to dwell for the benefit of\r\nhimself and the monastery.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Since such a brother desires to dwell in another monastery, where,\r\nas it seems to him, he can save his soul and serve God, know then that by\r\nthese letters dimissory, we have given him license to go to another\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\n(_c_) From the _Consuetudines_ of the Monastery of St. Paul at Rome.\r\n\r\nI, a humble abbot. You should know, beloved, that this brother, John or\r\nPaul by name, has asked us to give him permission to dwell with you. And,\r\nbecause we know that you observe the Rule of the order, we assent to his\r\ndwelling with you. I now commend him to you, that you may treat him as I\r\nwould, and for him you are to render an account to God as I would have had\r\nto render.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Another from the same.\r\n\r\nTo the venerable father the abbot of ( … ) monastery, the abbot of ( … )\r\nmonastery greeting with a holy kiss. Since our monastery has been burdened\r\nwith various embarrassments and poverty, we beseech your brotherliness\r\nthat you will receive our brother to dwell in your monastery, and we\r\ncommend him by these letters of commendation and dismission to your\r\njurisdiction and obedience.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Alternate conclusion:\r\n\r\n\r\nWe send him from our obedience to serve the Lord under your obedience.\r\n\r\n2. _Offering of a child to a monastery._ (MSL, 66:842.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following forms should be compared with chapter 59 of the\r\n    Rule. Children so offered were known as _oblati_, _i.e._, offered.\r\n    These forms are from a manuscript of the ninth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) To offer children to God is sanctioned in the Old and New Testaments\r\nas Abraham(276) … are related to have done. Moved by the example of these\r\nand many others, I ( … ) do now, for the salvation of my soul and for the\r\nsalvation of the souls of my parents, offer in the presence of the abbot (\r\n… ) this my son ( … ) to Almighty God and to St. Mary His mother,\r\naccording to the Rule of the blessed Benedict in the Monastery of Mons\r\nMajor, so that from this day forth it shall not be lawful for him to\r\nwithdraw his neck from the yoke of this service; and I promise never, by\r\nmyself or by any agent, to give him in any way opportunity of leaving, and\r\nthat this writing may be confirmed I sign it with my own hand.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Brief form.\r\n\r\nI give this boy in devotion to our Lord Jesus Christ, before God and His\r\nsaints, that he may remain all the days of his life and become a monk\r\nuntil his death.\r\n\r\n3. _Ceremony of receiving a monk into a Benedictine monastery._ (MSL,\r\n66:829.)\r\n\r\n(_a_) From Peter Boherius, _Commentary on the Regula S. Benedicti_, ch. 58\r\nof the Rule, _v. supra_.\r\n\r\nWhen the novice makes his solemn profession, the abbot vests to say mass,\r\nand after the offertory the abbot interrogates him saying:\r\n\r\nBrother (such a one): Is it your will to renounce the world and all its\r\npomps?\r\n\r\nHe answers: It is.\r\n\r\nAbbot: Will you promise obedience according to the Rule of St. Benedict?\r\nAnswer: I will.\r\n\r\nAbbot: May God give you his aid.\r\n\r\nThen the novice, or some one at his request, reads the aforesaid\r\nprofession, and when it has been read he places it upon his head, and then\r\nupon the altar. After this, when he has prostrated himself on his knees in\r\nfour directions in the form of a cross, he says the verse: Receive me, O\r\nLord, etc. And then the _Gloria Patri_, the _Kyrie Eleison_, the _Pater\r\nNoster_ and the Litany are said, the novice remaining prostrate on the\r\nground before the altar, until the end of the mass. And the brothers ought\r\nto be in the choir kneeling while the Litany is said. When the Litany has\r\nbeen said, then shall follow very devoutly the special prayers as\r\ncommanded by the Fathers, and immediately after the communion and before\r\nthe prayer is said, the garments of the novice, which have been folded and\r\nplaced before the altar, shall be blessed with their proper prayers; and\r\nthey shall be anointed and sprinkled with holy water by the abbot. After\r\n“_Ite, missa est_”(277) the novice rises from the ground, and having put\r\noff his old garments which were not blessed he puts on those which have\r\nbeen blessed, while the abbot recites: _Exuat te Dominus_, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd when the kiss has been given by the abbot, all the brothers in turn\r\ngive him the kiss of peace, and he shall keep silence for three days\r\ncontinuously after this, going about with his head covered and receiving\r\nthe communion every day.\r\n\r\n(_b_) From Theodore of Canterbury, _ibid._, 827.\r\n\r\nIn the ordination of monks the abbot ought to say mass, and say three\r\nprayers over the head of the novice; and for seven days he veils his head\r\nwith his cowl, and on the seventh day the abbot takes the veil off.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The Vow. From another form, _ibid._\r\n\r\nI promise concerning my stability and conversion of life and obedience\r\naccording to the Rule of St. Benedict before God and His saints.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 105. Foundation of Mediæval Culture and Schools\r\n\r\n\r\nSchools never wholly disappeared from Western society, either during the\r\nbarbarian invasion or in the even more troublous times that followed.\r\nSecular schools continued throughout the fifth century. During the sixth\r\ncentury they gave way for the most part to schools fostered by the Church,\r\nor were thoroughly transformed by ecclesiastical influences. In the fifth\r\nand sixth centuries, the great compends were made that served as\r\ntext-books for centuries. Boethius, Cassiodorus, Isidore of Seville, and\r\nBede represent great steps in the preparation for the mediæval schools.\r\nBut, apart from the survival of old schools, there was a real demand for\r\nthe establishment of new schools. The new monasticism needed them. It\r\nrequired some reading and study every day by the monks. As children were\r\nconstantly being received, ordinarily at the age of seven, these _oblati_\r\nneeded instruction. The monastic schools, which thus arose, early made\r\nprovision for the instruction of those not destined for the monastic life\r\nin the external schools of the monasteries. Then again, the need of clergy\r\nwith some literary training, however simple, was felt, especially as the\r\nsecular schools declined or were found not convenient, and conciliar\r\naction was taken in various countries to provide for such education. In\r\nthe conversion of the English, schools seem very early to have been\r\nestablished, and the encouragement given these schools by the learned\r\nTheodore of Tarsus, archbishop of Canterbury, bore splendid fruit, not\r\nmerely in the great school of Canterbury but still more in the monastic\r\nschools of the North, at Jarrow and Wearmouth and at York. It was from the\r\nschools in the North that the culture of the Frankish kingdom under\r\nCharles the Great largely came. There was always a marked difference of\r\nopinion as to the value of secular literature in education, as is shown by\r\nthe attitude already taken by Gregory the Great in his letter to\r\nDesiderius of Vienne, a letter which did much to discourage the literary\r\nstudy of the classics.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Augustine, _De Doctrina Christiana_, II, 40 (§ 60). (MSL, 34:63).\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Christian’s use of heathen writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The whole book should be examined carefully to see the working out\r\n    of the same idea in detail. St. Augustine was a man of literary\r\n    culture, although he was imperfectly acquainted with Greek. He\r\n    speaks from his own experience of the help he had derived from\r\n    this culture. The work _On Christian Doctrine_ is, in fact, not at\r\n    all a treatise on theology but on pedagogy, and was of immense\r\n    influence in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf those who are called philosophers and especially the Platonists have\r\nsaid anything true and in harmony with the faith, we ought not only not to\r\nshrink from it, but rather to appropriate it for our own use, taking it\r\nfrom them as from unlawful possessors. For as the Egyptians had not only\r\nthe idols and heavy burdens, which the people of Israel hated and fled\r\nfrom, but also vessels and ornaments of gold and silver and clothing which\r\nthe same people on going out of Egypt secretly appropriated to themselves\r\nas for a better use, not on their own authority but on the command of God,\r\nfor the Egyptians in their ignorance lent those things which they\r\nthemselves were not using well [Ex. 3:22; 12:35]; in the same way all\r\nbranches of heathen learning have not only false and superstitious fancies\r\nand heavy burdens of unnecessary toil which each of us, in going out under\r\nthe leadership of Christ from the fellowship of the heathen, ought to hate\r\nand avoid; but they contain also liberal instruction which it is well to\r\nadapt to the use of truth and some most useful precepts of morality; and\r\nsome truths in regard even to the worship of the one God are found among\r\nthem. Now these are, so to speak, their gold and silver, which they\r\nthemselves did not create, but dug, as it were, out of certain mines of\r\nGod’s providence, which are everywhere scattered abroad, and are\r\nperversely and unlawfully misused to the worship of devils. These,\r\ntherefore, the Christian, when he separates himself in spirit from the\r\nmiserable fellowship of these men, ought to take away from them for their\r\nproper use in preaching the Gospel. Their clothing also, that is, human\r\ninstitutions, adapted to that intercourse with men which is indispensable\r\nfor this life, it is right to take and to have so as to be turned to\r\nChristian use.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) John Cassian. _Institutiones_, V, 33, 34. (MSL, 49:249.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cassian, born 360, was one of the leaders of the monastic\r\n    movement. He founded monasteries near Marseilles, and did much to\r\n    spread the monastic movement in Gaul and Spain. His\r\n    _Institutiones_ and _Collationes_ were of influence, even after\r\n    his monasteries had been entirely supplanted by the Benedictines.\r\n    The opinion here given is probably that prevalent in the\r\n    monasteries in Egypt. It is utterly different from the spirit of\r\n    Basil, and the great theologians of Asia Minor who, in the matter\r\n    of secular studies, hold the same opinion as the older Alexandrian\r\n    school of Clement and Origen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 33. We also saw the abbot Theodore, a man endowed with the utmost\r\nholiness and with perfect knowledge not only of things of the practical\r\nlife but also of the meaning of the Scriptures, which he had acquired, not\r\nso much by study and reading, or secular scholarship, as by purity of\r\nheart alone; since he was able only with difficulty to understand or speak\r\neven but a few words in the Greek language. This man, when he was seeking\r\nan explanation of some most difficult question, continued indefatigably\r\nseven days and nights in prayer until, by a revelation of the Lord, he\r\nknew the answer to the question propounded.\r\n\r\nCh. 34. This man, therefore, when some of the brethren were wondering at\r\nthe splendid light of his knowledge, and were asking him some meanings of\r\nScripture, said: “A monk desiring to attain to a knowledge of the\r\nScriptures ought in no wise to spend his labor on the books of the\r\ncommentators, but rather to keep all the efforts of his mind and the\r\nintentions of his heart set on purification from carnal vices. When these\r\nare driven out, at once the eyes of the heart, when the veil of passions\r\nhas been removed, will begin, as it were, naturally to gaze on the\r\nmysteries of Scripture, since these were not declared unto us by the grace\r\nof the Holy Ghost to remain unknown and obscure; but they are rendered\r\nobscure by our vices, as the veil of our sins cover the eyes of the heart,\r\nand for these, when restored to their natural health, the mere reading of\r\nHoly Scripture is amply sufficient for the perception of the true\r\nknowledge; nor do they need the instruction of commentators, just as these\r\neyes of flesh need no man’s assistance to see provided they are free from\r\nthe dimness or darkness of blindness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Gregory the Great, _Ep. ad Desiderium_, Reg. XI, ep. 54. (MSL,\r\n77:1171.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Desiderius was bishop of Vienne. This letter was sent with several\r\n    others written in connection with the sending of Mellitus to\r\n    England; see Bede, _Hist. Ec._, I, 27, 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany good things have been reported to us regarding your pursuits, and\r\nsuch joy arose in our hearts that we could not bear to refuse what your\r\nfraternity had requested to have granted you. But afterward it came to our\r\nears, what we cannot mention without shame, that thy fraternity is in the\r\nhabit of expounding grammar to certain persons. This thing pained us so\r\nand we so strongly disapproved of it that we changed what had been said\r\nbefore into groaning and sadness, since the praises of Christ cannot find\r\nroom in the one mouth with the praises of Jupiter. And consider thyself\r\nwhat a grave and heinous offence it is for bishops to sing what is not\r\nbecoming even for a religious layman. And, though our most beloved son\r\nCandidus, the presbyter, who was strictly examined on this matter when he\r\ncame to us, denied it and endeavored to excuse you, yet still the thought\r\nhas not left our mind that, in proportion as it is execrable for such a\r\nthing to be related of a priest, it ought to be ascertained by strict and\r\nveracious evidence whether or not it be so. If, therefore, hereafter what\r\nhas been reported to us should prove to be evidently false, and it should\r\nbe clear that you do not apply yourself to trifles and secular literature,\r\nwe shall give thanks to God, who has not permitted your heart to be\r\nstained with the blasphemous phrases of what is abominable; and we will\r\ntreat without misgiving or hesitation concerning granting what you have\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nWe commend to you in all respects the monks whom, together with our most\r\nbeloved son Laurentius, the presbyter, and Mellitus, the abbot, we have\r\nsent to our most reverend brother and fellow-bishop Augustine, that by the\r\nhelp of your fraternity no delay may hinder their journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Council of Vaison, A. D. 529, _Canon_ 1. Bruns, II, 183.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Vaison is a small see in the province of Arles. The synod was\r\n    attended by about a dozen bishops. It is, therefore, not\r\n    authoritative for a large district, but when taken in connection\r\n    with the following selection indicates a wide-spread custom.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat presbyters in their parishes shall bring up and instruct young\r\nreaders in their houses. It was decided that all presbyters who are placed\r\nin parishes should, according to a custom which we learn is very\r\nbeneficially observed throughout Italy, receive young readers, as many as\r\nthey have who are unmarried, into their house where they dwell, and as\r\ngood fathers shall endeavor to bring them up spiritually to render the\r\nPsalms, and to instruct them in the divine readings, and to educate them\r\nin the law of the Lord, that so they may provide for themselves worthy\r\nsuccessors, and receive from the Lord eternal rewards. But when they come\r\nto full age, if any of them, on account of the weakness of the flesh, wish\r\nto marry, they shall not be denied the right of doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) II Council of Toledo, A. D. 531, _Canon_ 1. Bruns, I, 207.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning those whom their parents voluntarily give in the first years of\r\ntheir childhood to the office of the clergy, we have decreed this to be\r\nobserved; namely, that as soon as they have been tonsured or have been\r\ngiven to the care of appointed persons, they ought to be educated by some\r\none set over them, in the church building, and in the presence of the\r\nbishop. When they have completed their eighteenth year, they shall be\r\nasked by the bishop, in the presence of all the clergy and people, their\r\nwill as to seeking marriage. And if by God’s inspiration they have the\r\ngrace of chastity, and shall have promised to observe the profession of\r\ntheir chastity without any necessity of marriage, let these who are more\r\ndesirous of the hardest life put on the most gentle yoke of the Lord, and\r\nfirst let them receive from their twentieth year the ministry of the\r\nsubdiaconate, probation having been made of their profession, that, if\r\nblamelessly and without offence they attain the twenty-fifth year of their\r\nage, they may be promoted to the office of the diaconate, if they have\r\nbeen proved by their bishop to be able to fulfil it.…\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) Bede, _Hist. Ec._, III, 18. (MSL, 95:144.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sigebert became king of the East Angles about 631 and died 637.\r\n    The facts known of him are briefly recorded in DCB.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time the kingdom of the East Angles, after the death of Earpwald,\r\nthe successor of Redwald, was subject to his brother Sigebert, a good and\r\nreligious man, who long before had been baptized in France, whilst he\r\nlived in banishment, flying from the enmity of Redwald; when he returned\r\nhome and had ascended the throne he was desirous of imitating the good\r\ninstitutions which he had seen in France, and he set up a school for the\r\nyoung to be instructed in letters, and was assisted therein by Bishop\r\nFelix, who had come to him from Kent and who furnished him with masters\r\nand teachers after the manner of that country.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) Bede, _Hist. Ec._, IV, 2. (MSL, 95:173.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodore arrived at his church the second year after his consecration, on\r\nSunday, May 27, and held the same twenty-one years, three months and\r\ntwenty-six days. Soon after he visited all the islands, wherever the\r\ntribes of the Angles dwelt, for he was willingly entertained and heard by\r\nall persons. Everywhere he was attended and assisted by Hadrian, and he\r\ntaught the right rule of life and the canonical custom of celebrating\r\nEaster.(278) This was the first archbishop whom all the English Church\r\nobeyed. And forasmuch as both of them were, as has been said, well read in\r\nsacred and secular literature, they gathered a crowd of scholars and there\r\ndaily flowed from them rivers of knowledge to water the hearts of their\r\nhearers; and together with the books of the holy Scriptures they also\r\ntaught them the arts of ecclesiastical poetry, astronomy, and arithmetic.\r\nA testimony of which is that there are still living at this day [_circa_\r\nA. D. 727] some of their scholars who are as well versed in the Greek and\r\nLatin tongues as in their own, in which they were born. Never were there\r\nhappier times since the English came to Britain; for their kings were\r\nbrave men and good Christians and were a terror to all barbarous nations,\r\nand the minds of all men were bent upon the joys of the heavenly kingdom\r\nof which they had just heard. And all who desired instruction in sacred\r\nreading had masters at hand to teach them. From that time also they began\r\nin all the churches of the English to learn sacred music which till then\r\nhad been only known in Kent. And excepting James, mentioned above, the\r\nfirst singing-master(279) in the churches of the Northumbrians was Eddi,\r\nsurnamed Stephen, invited from Kent by the most reverend Wilfrid, who was\r\nthe first of the bishops of the English nation that taught the churches of\r\nthe English the Catholic mode of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_h_) Council of Clovesho, A. D. 747, _Canon_ 7. Haddan and Stubbs, III,\r\n360.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey decreed in the seventh article of agreement that bishops, abbots, and\r\nabbesses should by all means take care and diligently provide that their\r\nfamilies should incessantly apply their minds to reading, and that\r\nknowledge be spread by the voices of many to the gaining of souls and to\r\nthe praise of the eternal King. For it is sad to say how few(280) in these\r\ntimes do heartily love and labor for sacred knowledge and are willing to\r\ntake pains in learning, but they are from their youth up rather employed\r\nin divers vanities and the affectation of vainglory; and they rather\r\npursue the amusements of this present unstable life than the assiduous\r\nstudy of holy Scriptures. Therefore let boys be kept and trained up in\r\nsuch schools, to the love of sacred knowledge, and that, being by this\r\nmeans well learned, they may become in all respects useful to the Church\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. The Revolution In The Ecclesiastical And Political Situation\r\nDue To The Rise Of Islam And The Doctrinal Disputes In The Eastern Church\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the seventh and eighth centuries, the ecclesiastical and\r\npolitical situation altered completely. This change was due, in the first\r\nplace, to the rise of the religion and empire of the Moslems, whereby a\r\nvery large part of the Eastern Empire was conquered by the followers of\r\nthe Prophet, who had rapidly extended their conquests over Syria and the\r\nbest African provinces. Reduced in extent and exposed to ever fresh\r\nattacks from a powerful enemy, the Eastern Empire had to face new\r\npolitical problems. In the second place, as the provinces overrun\r\ncontained the greater number of those dissatisfied with the doctrinal\r\nresults of the great councils, the apparently interminable contests over\r\nthe question as to the two natures of Christ came to an unexpected end.\r\nThis did not take place until a new cause for dispute had arisen among the\r\nadherents of Chalcedon, due to an attempt to win back the Monophysites by\r\naccounting for the unity of the person of Christ by positing one will in\r\nJesus. Monotheletism at once became among the adherents of Chalcedon a\r\nburning question. It was finally condemned at the Sixth General Council,\r\nConstantinople, A. D. 683, at which Pope Agatho played a part very similar\r\nto that played by Pope Leo at Chalcedon, but at the cost of seeing his\r\npredecessor, Honorius, condemned as a Monothelete. It was the last triumph\r\nof the West in the dogmatic controversies of the East. The Eastern\r\necclesiastics, irritated at the diplomatic triumph of Rome, expressed\r\ntheir resentment at the Concilium Quinisextum, in 692, where, in passing\r\ncanons to complete the work of the Fifth and Sixth Councils, an\r\nopportunity was embraced of expressly condemning several Roman practices.\r\nIn the confusion resulting in the next century from the attempt of Leo the\r\nIsaurian to put an end to the use of images in the churches, the Roman see\r\nwas able to rid itself of the nominal control which the Emperor still had\r\nover the papacy by means of the exarchate of Ravenna. When the Lombards\r\npressed too heavily upon the papacy it was easy for the Bishop of Rome to\r\nmake an alliance with the Franks, who on their side saw that it was\r\nprofitable to employ the papacy in the advancement of their own schemes.\r\nIn this way arose that alliance between the pontiff and the new Frankish\r\nmonarchy upon which the ecclesiastical development of the Middle Ages\r\nrests. But Iconoclasm suffered defeat at the Seventh General Council, 787,\r\nin which the doctrinal system of the East was completed. As this was the\r\nlast undisputed general council, it may be taken as marking the\r\ntermination of the history of the ancient Church. In following the further\r\ncourse of the Western Church there is no longer need of a detailed tracing\r\nof the history of the Eastern Church, which ceased to be a determining\r\nfactor in the religious life of the West. The two parts of Christendom\r\ncome in contact from time to time, but without formal schism they have\r\nceased to be organically united.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 106. The Rise and Extension of Islam\r\n\r\n\r\nMohammed (571-632) began his work as a prophet at Mecca about 613, having\r\nbeen “called” about three years earlier. He was driven from Mecca in 622\r\nand fled to Yathrib, afterward known as Medina. Here he was able to unite\r\nwarring factions and, placing himself at their head, to build up despotic\r\nauthority over the surrounding country. He steadily increased the\r\nterritory under his sway, and by conquests and diplomacy was able to gain\r\nMecca in 629. Before his death in 632 he had conquered all Arabia. His\r\nauthority continued in his family after his death, and the course of\r\nconquest went on. Damascus was conquered in 635; in 636 the Emperor\r\nHeraclius was driven to abandon Syria, which now fell into the hands of\r\nthe Moslems. In 637 the Persians were forced back. In 640 Egypt was taken,\r\nand by 650 all between Carthage and the eastern border of Persia had been\r\nacquired for Islam. In 693, after a period of civil war, the work of\r\nconquest was resumed. In 709 all the African coast as far as the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar was gained, and in 711 the Moslems entered Spain. They at\r\nonce made themselves masters of the peninsula with the exception of a\r\nsmall strip in the north in the mountains of Asturias, the kingdom of\r\nGallicia. Crossing the Pyrenees, they attempted to possess Gaul, but were\r\nforced to retreat from central Gaul by Charles Martel at the battle at\r\nTours and Poitiers in 732. They maintained themselves north of the\r\nPyrenees until 759 when they were driven out of Narbonne and across the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: _The Koran_, standard translation by\r\n    E.

If I had said it, Thou wouldest have known it; Thou knowest what is in\r\nmy soul, but I know not what is in Thy soul; verily Thou art one who\r\nknoweth the unseen. I never told them save what Thou didst bid me,\r\n‘Worship God, my Lord and your Lord,’ and I was a witness against them so\r\nlong as I was among them, but when Thou didst take me away to Thyself Thou\r\nwert the watcher over them, for Thou art witness over all.”…\r\n\r\n\r\nSurah IV, 152.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Relation of Islam to Judaism and Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[152.] The people of the Book will ask thee to bring down for them a book\r\nfrom heaven; but they asked Moses a greater thing than that, for they\r\nsaid, “Show us God openly”; but the thunderbolt caught them in their\r\ninjustice. Then they took a calf, after what had come to them of manifest\r\nsigns; but we pardoned that, and gave Moses obvious authority. And we held\r\nover them the mountain at their compact, and said to them, “Enter ye the\r\ndoor adoring,” and we said to them, “Transgress not on the Sabbath day,”\r\nand we took from them a rigid compact.\r\n\r\nBut for that they broke their compact, and for their misbelief in God’s\r\nsigns, and for their killing the prophets undeservedly, and for their\r\nsaying, “Our hearts are uncircumcised”—nay, God hath stamped on them their\r\nmisbelief, so that they cannot believe, except a few—and for their\r\nmisbelief, and for their saying about Mary a mighty calumny, and for their\r\nsaying, “Verily we have killed the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, the\r\napostle of God,” but they did not kill Him, and they did not crucify Him,\r\nbut a similitude was made for them. And verily, those who differ about Him\r\nare in doubt concerning Him; they have no knowledge concerning Him, but\r\nonly follow an opinion. They did not kill Him, for sure! nay God raised\r\nHim up unto Himself; for God is mighty and wise!…\r\n\r\n[164.] O ye people of the Book! do not exceed in your religion, nor say\r\nagainst God save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, is but\r\nthe apostle of God and His Word, which He cast into Mary and a spirit from\r\nHim; believe then in God and His apostles, and say not “Three.” Have done!\r\nit were better for you.

(MSL, 95:654.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Advance of the Saracens.\r\n\r\n\r\nCh. 46. At that time [A. D. 711] the people of the Saracens, crossing over\r\nfrom Africa at a place which is called Ceuta, invaded all Spain. Then\r\nafter ten years, coming with their wives and children, they invaded as if\r\nto settle in Aquitania, a province of Gaul. Charles(285) had at that time\r\na dispute with Eudo, prince of Aquitania. But they came to an agreement\r\nand fought with perfect harmony against the Saracens. For the Franks fell\r\nupon them(286) and slew three hundred and seventy-five thousand of them;\r\nbut on the side of the Franks only fifteen hundred fell. Eudo with his men\r\nbroke into their camp and slew many and laid waste all.\r\n\r\nCh. 47. At the same time [A. D. 717], the same people of the Saracens with\r\nan immense army came and encompassed Constantinople and for three years\r\nbesieged it until, when the people had called upon God with great\r\nearnestness, many of the enemy perished from hunger and cold and by war\r\nand pestilence and so wearied out they abandoned the siege. When they had\r\nleft they carried on war against the people of the Bulgarians who were\r\nbeyond the Danube, but, vanquished by them also, they fled back to their\r\nships. But when they had put out to the deep sea, a sudden storm fell upon\r\nthem and many were drowned and their vessels were destroyed. But in\r\nConstantinople three hundred thousand men died of the pestilence.\r\n\r\nCh. 48. Now when Liutprand heard that the Saracens, when Sardinia had been\r\nlaid waste, had also polluted those places where the bones of the holy\r\nbishop Augustine, on account of the devastation of the barbarians, had\r\nformerly been transported and solemnly buried, he sent thither and when he\r\nhad given a large sum obtained them and transported them to the city of\r\nPavia, where he buried them with the honor due so great a father.(287) In\r\nthese days the city of Narnia was conquered by the Lombards.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 107. The Monothelete Controversy and the Sixth General Council,\r\nConstantinople A. D. 681\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monothelete controversy was the natural outcome of the earlier\r\nChristological controversies. With the assertion of the two complete and\r\npersisting natures of Christ, the question must sooner or later arise as\r\nto whether there was one will or two in Christ. If there were two wills,\r\nit seemed to lead back to Nestorianism; if there was but one, either the\r\nhumanity was incomplete or the position led to virtual monophysitism. But\r\npolitical causes played even a greater part than the theological\r\ndialectic. The Emperor Heraclius, in attempting to win back the\r\nMonophysite churches, on account of the war with Persia and later on\r\naccount of the advancing Moslems, proposed that a union should be effected\r\non the basis of a formula which asserted that there was but one will in\r\nthe God-man. This had been suggested to him in 622 by Sergius, patriarch\r\nof Constantinople [Hefele, §§ 291, 295]. In 633 Cyrus of Phasis, since 630\r\npatriarch of Alexandria, brought about a union between the Orthodox Church\r\nand the Egyptian Monophysites on the basis of a Monothelete formula,\r\n_i.e._, a statement that there was but one will or energy in Christ. At\r\nonce a violent controversy broke out. The formula was supported by\r\nHonorius of Rome, but attacked by Sophronius, patriarch of Jerusalem, and\r\nafter the fall of Jerusalem in 638, by the monk Maximus Confessor. In 638\r\nHeraclius tried to end the controversy by an _Ecthesis_ [_Hefele_, § 299],\r\nand Constans II (641-668) attempted the same in 648, by his _Typos_. But\r\nat the Lateran Council of 649, under Martin I, Monotheletism as well as\r\nthe _Ecthesis_ and _Typos_ were condemned. For this Martin was ultimately\r\nbanished, dying in misery, 654, in the Chersonesus, and Maximus, after a\r\nlong, cruel imprisonment, and horrible torture and mutilation, died in\r\nexile, 662. But Constantius Pogonatus (668-685), the successor of Constans\r\nII, determined to settle the matter by a general council. Pope Agatho\r\n(678-682) thereupon held a great council at Rome, 679, at which it was\r\ndecided to insist at the coming general council upon the strictest\r\nmaintenance of the decisions of the Roman Council of 649. On this basis\r\nAgatho dictated the formula which was accepted by the Council of\r\nConstantinople, A. D. 681, which sent its proceedings and conclusions to\r\nthe Pope to be approved. Along with them was an express condemnation of\r\nHonorius. Leo II (682-683), Agatho’s successor, approved the council with\r\nspecial mention of Honorius as condemned for his heresy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Cyrus of Alexandria, _Formula of Union_, A. D. 633, Hahn, § 232.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The author of this formula, known also as Cyrus of Phasis, under\r\n    which name he was condemned at Constantinople, A. D. 680,\r\n    attempted to win over the Monophysites in Alexandria and met with\r\n    great success on account of his formula of union. The first five\r\n    anathemas, the form in which the formula is composed, are clearly\r\n    based upon the first four councils. The sixth is slightly\r\n    different; and the seventh, the most important, is clearly tending\r\n    toward Monotheletism. The document is to be found in the\r\n    proceedings of the Sixth General Council in Mansi, and also in\r\n    Hardouin. For a synopsis, see Hefele, § 293, who is most valuable\r\n    for the whole controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. If any one does not confess the one Christ, the one Son, to be of two\r\nnatures, that is, divinity and humanity, one nature become flesh(288) of\r\nGod the Word, according to the holy Cyril, unmixed, unchanged,\r\nunchangeable, that is to say, one synthetic hypostasis, who is the same,\r\nour Lord Jesus Christ, being one of the holy homoousian Triad, let such an\r\none be anathema.\r\n\r\n7. If any one, saying that our one Lord Jesus Christ is to be regarded in\r\ntwo natures, does not confess that He is one of the Holy Triad, God the\r\nWord, eternally begotten of the Father, in the last times of the world\r\nmade flesh and born of our all-holy and spotless lady, the Theotokos and\r\never-virgin Mary; but is this and another and not one and the same,\r\naccording to the most wise Cyril, perfect in deity and the same perfect in\r\nhumanity, and accordingly only to be thought of as in two natures; the\r\nsame suffering and not suffering, according to one or the other nature, as\r\nthe same holy Cyril said, suffering as a man in the flesh, inasmuch as he\r\nwas a man, remaining as God without suffering in the sufferings of His own\r\nflesh; and the one and the same Christ energizing the divine and the human\r\nthings with the one theandric energy,(289) according to the holy\r\nDionysius; distinguishing only in thought those things from which the\r\nunion has taken place, and viewing these in the mind as remaining\r\nunchanged, unalterable, and unmixed after their union according to nature\r\nand hypostasis; and recognizing in these without division or separation\r\nthe one and the same Christ and Son, inasmuch as he regards in his mind\r\ntwo as brought together to each other without commingling, making the\r\ntheory of them as a matter of fact, but not by a lying imagination and\r\nvain combinations of the mind; but in nowise separating them, since now\r\nthe division into two has been destroyed on account of the indescribable\r\nand incomprehensible union; saying with the holy Athanasius, for there is\r\nnow flesh and again the flesh of God the Word, now flesh animated and\r\nintelligent, and again the flesh of the animated and intelligent God the\r\nWord; but should under such expressions understand a distinction into\r\nparts, let such an one be anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) Constans II, _Typos_, A. D. 648, Mansi, X, 1029. _Cf._ Kirch, nn.\r\n972 _f._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The attempt to end the controversy by returning to the condition\r\n    of things before the controversy broke out, an entirely futile\r\n    undertaking. The question having been raised had to be discussed\r\n    and settled by rational processes. See Hefele, § 306.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it is our custom to do everything and to consider everything which\r\ncan serve the welfare of the Christian State, and especially what concerns\r\nour true faith, by which we believe all our happiness is brought about, we\r\nperceive that our orthodox people are greatly disturbed, because some in\r\nrespect to the Economy(290) of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ\r\nassert that there is only one will, and that one and the same affects both\r\nthe divine and human deeds; but others teach two wills and two operations\r\nin the same dispensation of the incarnate Word. The former defend their\r\nviews by asserting that our Lord Jesus Christ was only one person in two\r\nnatures, and therefore without confusion or separation, working and\r\nwilling as well the divine as the human deeds. The others say that because\r\nin one and the same person two natures are joined without any separation,\r\nso their differences from each other remain, and according to the\r\ncharacter of each nature one and the same Christ works as well the divine\r\nas the human; and from this our Christian State has been brought to much\r\ndissension and confusion, so that differing from one another they do not\r\nagree, and from this the State must in many ways needs suffer.\r\n\r\nWe believe that, under God’s guidance, we must extinguish the flames\r\nenkindled by discord, and we ought not to permit them further to destroy\r\nhuman souls. We decree, therefore, that our subjects who hold our\r\nimmaculate and orthodox Christian faith, and who are of the Catholic and\r\nApostolic Church, shall from the present moment on have no longer any\r\npermission to raise any sort of dispute and quarrel or strife with one\r\nanother over the one will and energy, or over two wills and two energies.\r\nWe order that this is not in any way to take anything from the pious\r\nteaching, which the holy and approved Fathers have taught concerning the\r\nincarnation of God the Word, but with the purpose that all further strife\r\nin regard to the aforesaid questions cease, and in this matter we follow\r\nand hold as sufficient only the Holy Scriptures and the tradition of the\r\nfive holy general councils and the simple statements and unquestioned\r\nusage and expressions of the approved Fathers (of which the dogmas, rules,\r\nand laws of God’s holy Catholic and Apostolic Church consists), without\r\nadding to or taking from them anything, or without explaining them against\r\ntheir proper meaning, but everywhere shall be preserved the former\r\ncustoms, as before the disputes broke out, as if no such dispute had\r\nexisted. As to those who have hitherto taught one will and one energy or\r\ntwo wills and two energies, there shall be no accusation on this account;\r\nexcepting only those who have been cast forth as heretics, together with\r\ntheir impious doctrines and writings, by the five holy universal councils\r\nand other approved orthodox Fathers. But to complete the unity and\r\nfellowship of the churches of God, and that there remain no further\r\nopportunity or occasion to those who are eager for endless dispute, we\r\norder that the document,(291) which for a long time has been posted up in\r\nthe narthex of the most holy principal church of this our God-preserved\r\nroyal city, and which touches upon the points in dispute, shall be taken\r\ndown. Whoever dares to transgress this command is subject before all to\r\nthe fearful judgment of Almighty God, and then also will be liable to the\r\npunishment for such as despise the imperial commands. If he be a bishop or\r\nclergyman, he will altogether be deposed from his priesthood or clerical\r\norder; if a monk, excommunicated and driven out of his residence; if a\r\ncivil or military officer, he shall lose his rank and office; if a private\r\ncitizen, he shall, if noble, be punished pecuniarily, if of lower rank, be\r\nsubjected to corporal punishment and perpetual exile.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Council of Rome, A.

If any one does not, according to the holy Fathers, and in\r\ncompany with us, reject and anathematize with mind and mouth all those\r\nwhom as most wicked heretics the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of\r\nGod, that is, the five universal synods and likewise all approved Fathers\r\nof the Church, rejects and anathematizes, with all their impious writings\r\neven to each point, that is, Sabellius, etc. … and justly with these, as\r\nlike them and in equal error … Cyrus of Alexandria, Sergius of\r\nConstantinople, and his successors Pyrrhus and Paul, persisting in their\r\npride, and all their impious writings, and those who to the end agreed\r\nwith them in their thought, or do so agree, that there is one will and one\r\noperation of the deity and manhood of Christ; and in addition to these the\r\nmost impious _Ecthesis_, which, by the persuasion of the same Sergius, was\r\nput forth by the former Emperor Heraclius against the orthodox faith,\r\ndefining, by way of adjustment, one will in Christ our God, and one\r\noperation to be venerated; also all those things which were impiously\r\nwritten or done by them; and those who received it, or any of those things\r\nwhich were written or done for it; and along with these, furthermore, the\r\nwicked _Typos_, which, on the persuasion of the aforesaid Paul, was\r\nrecently issued by our most serene prince Constans against the Catholic\r\nChurch, inasmuch as it equally denies and excludes from discussion the two\r\nnatural wills and operations, a divine and a human, which are piously\r\ntaught by the holy Fathers to be in Christ, our God, and also our Saviour,\r\nand also the one will and operation, which by the heretics is impiously\r\nvenerated in Him, and therefore declaring that with the holy Fathers also\r\nthe wicked heretics are unjustly freed from all rebuke and condemnation,\r\nto the destruction of the definitions of the Catholic Church and its rule\r\nof faith … let him be condemned.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Sixth General Council, Constantinople, A.

II, vol. XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe holy, great, and ecumenical synod assembled by the grace of God and\r\nthe religious decree of the most religious, faithful, and mighty Emperor\r\nConstantine, in this God-preserved and royal city of Constantinople, New\r\nRome, in the hall of the imperial palace called Trullus, has decreed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe only begotten Son and Word of God the Father, who was made man, like\r\nunto us in all things, without sin, Christ our true God, has declared\r\nexpressly in the words of the Gospel: “I am the light of the world; he\r\nthat followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of\r\nlife” [John 8:12]; and again: “My peace I leave with you, My peace I give\r\nunto you” [John 14:27]. Our most gracious Emperor, the champion of\r\northodoxy and opponent of evil doctrine, being reverentially led by this\r\ndivinely uttered doctrine of peace, and having assembled this our holy and\r\necumenical synod, has united the judgment of the whole Church. Wherefore\r\nthis our holy and ecumenical synod, having driven away the impious error\r\nwhich has prevailed for a certain time until now, and following closely\r\nthe straight path of the holy and approved Fathers, has piously given its\r\nassent to the five holy and ecumenical synods—that is to say, to that of\r\nthe three hundred and eighteen holy Fathers assembled at Nicæa against the\r\ninsane Arius; and the next at Constantinople of the one hundred and fifty\r\nGod-inspired men against Macedonius, the adversary of the Spirit, and the\r\nimpious Apollinaris; and also the first at Ephesus of two hundred\r\nvenerable men assembled against Nestorius, the Judaizer; and that in\r\nChalcedon of six hundred and thirty God-inspired Fathers against Eutyches\r\nand Dioscurus, hated of God; and in addition to these the last, that is\r\nthe fifth, holy synod assembled in this place against Theodore of\r\nMopsuestia, Origen, Didymus, and Evagrius, and the writings of Theodoret\r\nagainst the twelve chapters of the celebrated Cyril, and the epistle which\r\nwas said to have been written by Ibas to Maris the Persian—without\r\nalteration this synod renews in all points the ancient decrees of\r\nreligion, chasing away the impious doctrines of irreligion. And this our\r\nholy and ecumenical synod, inspired of God, has set its seal to the creed\r\nof the three hundred and eighteen Fathers, and again religiously confirmed\r\nby the one hundred and fifty, which also the other holy synods gladly\r\nreceived and ratified for the removal of every soul-destroying heresy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Then follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Nicene Creed of the three hundred and eighteen holy Fathers.\r\n    _We believe_, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Creed of the one hundred and fifty holy Fathers assembled at\r\n    Constantinople. _We believe_, etc., but without the _filioque_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe holy and ecumenical synod further says that this pious and orthodox\r\ncreed of the divine grace would be sufficient for the full knowledge and\r\nconfirmation of the orthodox faith. But as the author of evil, who in the\r\nbeginning availed himself of the aid of the serpent, and by it brought the\r\npoison of death upon the human race, has not desisted, but in like manner\r\nnow, having found suitable instruments for the accomplishment of his\r\nwill—that is to say, Theodorus, who was bishop of Pharan; Sergius,\r\nPyrrhus, Paul and Peter, who were prelates of this royal city; and also\r\nHonorius, who was pope of Old Rome; Cyrus, bishop of Alexandria,\r\nMarcarius, lately bishop of Antioch, and Stephen, his disciple—has not\r\nceased with their declaration of orthodoxy by this our God-assembled and\r\nholy synod; for according to the sentence spoken of God: “Where two or\r\nthree are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them”\r\n[Matt. 18:20], the present(292) holy and ecumenical synod, faithfully\r\nreceiving and saluting with uplifted hands also the suggestion which by\r\nthe most holy and blessed Pope Agatho, Pope of Old Rome, was sent to our\r\nmost pious and faithful Emperor Constantine, which rejected by name those\r\nwho taught or preached one will and operation in the dispensation of the\r\nincarnation of Christ(293) our very God, has likewise adopted that other\r\nsynodal suggestion which was sent by the council held under the same most\r\nholy Pope, composed of one hundred and twenty-five bishops beloved of\r\nGod,(294) to his God-instructed tranquillity [_i.e._, the Emperor], as\r\nconsonant to the holy Council of Chalcedon and the _Tome_ of the most holy\r\nand blessed Leo, Pope of the same Old Rome, which was directed to the holy\r\nFlavian, which also the council called the pillar of a right faith; and\r\nalso agrees with the synodical letters written by the blessed Cyril\r\nagainst the impious Nestorius and addressed to the Oriental bishops.\r\n\r\nFollowing(295) the five holy and ecumenical synods and the most holy and\r\napproved Fathers, with one voice defining that our Lord Jesus Christ must\r\nbe confessed to be our very God, one of the holy and consubstantial and\r\nlife-giving Trinity, perfect in deity and the same perfect in humanity,\r\ntruly God and truly man, of a reasonable soul and body; consubstantial\r\nwith His Father as to His godhead, and consubstantial with us as to His\r\nmanhood; in all things like unto us, without sin [Heb. 4:15]; begotten of\r\nHis Father before the ages according to His godhead, but in these last\r\ndays for us men and for our salvation begotten of the Holy Ghost and of\r\nthe Virgin Mary, strictly and in truth Theotokos, according to the flesh;\r\none and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only begotten, in two natures\r\nunconfusedly, unchangeably, inseparably, indivisibly to be recognized; the\r\npeculiarities of neither nature lost by the union, but rather the\r\nproperties of each nature preserved, concurring in one person,(296) and in\r\none subsistence,(297) not parted or divided into two persons, but one and\r\nthe same only begotten Son, the Word of God,(298) the Lord Jesus Christ,\r\naccording as the prophets of old have taught, and as Jesus Christ Himself\r\nhath taught, and the creed of the holy Fathers hath delivered to us;(299)\r\nwe likewise declare that in Him are two natural wills or willings and two\r\nnatural operations indivisibly, unchangeably, inseparably, unconfusedly,\r\naccording to the teaching of the holy Fathers. And these two natural wills\r\nare not contrary one to the other (which God forbid), as the impious\r\nheretics say, but His human will follows, not as resisting or reluctant,\r\nbut rather therefore as subject to His divine and omnipotent will. For it\r\nwas right that the will of the flesh should be moved, but be subject to\r\nthe divine will, according to the most wise Athanasius. For as His flesh\r\nis called and is the flesh of God the Word, so also the natural will of\r\nHis flesh is called and is the proper will of God the Word, as He Himself\r\nsays: “I came down from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of\r\nthe Father which sent Me,” [John 6:38], wherein he calls His own will the\r\nwill of the flesh, inasmuch as His flesh was also His own. For as His most\r\nholy and immaculately animated flesh was not destroyed because it was\r\ndeified [θεωθεῖσα], but continued in its own state and nature, so also His\r\nhuman will, although deified, was not taken away, but rather was preserved\r\naccording to the saying of Gregory the Theologian:(300) “His will, namely\r\nthat of the Saviour, is not contrary to God, but altogether deified.”\r\n\r\nWe glorify two natural operations, indivisibly, unchangeably, inseparably,\r\nunconfusedly, in the same our Lord Jesus Christ, our true God, that is to\r\nsay, a divine operation and a human operation, according to the divine\r\npreacher Leo, who most distinctly says as follows: “For each form does in\r\ncommunion with the other what pertains to it, namely the Word doing what\r\npertains to the Word, and the flesh what pertains to the flesh.”(301) For\r\nwe will not admit one natural operation of God and of the creature, that\r\nwe may not exalt into the divine essence what is created, nor will we\r\nbring down the glory of the divine nature to the place suited for those\r\nthings which have been made. We recognize the miracles and the sufferings\r\nas of one and the same person, but of one or of the other nature of which\r\nHe is, and in which He has His existence, as the admirable Cyril said.\r\nPreserving in all respects, therefore, the unconfusedness and\r\nindivisibility, we express all in brief phrase: Believing that our Lord\r\nJesus Christ, one of the Trinity also after the incarnation, is our true\r\nGod, we say that His two natures shone forth in His one subsistence\r\n[hypostasis], in which were both the miracles and the suffering throughout\r\nthe whole incarnate life,(302) not in appearance merely but in reality,\r\nthe difference as to nature being recognized in one and the same\r\nsubsistence; for, although joined together, each nature wills and operates\r\nthe things proper to it.(303) For this reason we glorify two natural(304)\r\nwills and operations concurring most fitly in Him for the salvation of the\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\nSince these things have been formulated by us with all diligence and care,\r\nwe decree that to no one shall it be permitted to bring forward or write\r\nor to compose or to think or to teach otherwise. Whosoever shall presume\r\nto compose a different faith or to propose, or to teach, or to hand to\r\nthose wishing to be converted to the knowledge of the truth from the\r\nheathen or the Jews or from any heresy any different symbol, or to\r\nintroduce a new mode of expression to subvert these things which have now\r\nbeen determined by us, all these, if they be bishops or clergy, shall be\r\ndeposed, the bishops from the episcopate, the clergy from the clerical\r\noffice; but if they be monks or laymen, they shall be anathematized.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) Council of Constantinople, A. D. 681, _Sessio_ XIII. Mansi, XI,\r\n1050. _Cf._ Mirbt, n. 188.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The condemnation of the Monotheletes, including Honorius of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The condemnation of Honorius has become a _cause célèbre_,\r\n    especially in connection with the doctrine of papal infallibility.\r\n    It should be observed, however, that the doctrine of papal\r\n    infallibility, as defined at the Vatican Council, A. D. 1870\r\n    (_cf._ Mirbt, n. 509), requires that only when the Pope speaks _ex\r\n    cathedra_ is he infallible, and it has not been shown that any\r\n    opinion whatever held by Honorius was an _ex cathedra_ definition\r\n    of faith and morals according to the Vatican Council. The matter\r\n    is therefore a mere question of fact and may be treated apart from\r\n    the Vatican dogma. It should be borne in mind, further, that the\r\n    Sixth General Council was approved by Pope Leo II, A. D. 682\r\n    (_cf._ Mirbt, n. 189), who included Honorius by name among those\r\n    whose condemnation was approved. That he did so approve it is also\r\n    stated in the _Liber Pontificalis_ (_cf._ Mirbt, n. 190), and\r\n    according to the _Liber Diurnus_, the official book of formulæ\r\n    used in the papal business, the Pope took an oath recognizing\r\n    among others the Sixth General Council, and condemning Honorius\r\n    among other heretics (_cf._ Mirbt, n. 191). That Honorius was\r\n    actually a heretic is still another matter; for it seems not at\r\n    all unlikely that he misunderstood the point at issue and his\r\n    language is quite unscientific. The text of the letters of\r\n    Honorius may be found in Kirch, nn. 949-965, and in Hefele in a\r\n    translation, §§ 296, 298. On the condemnation of Honorius, see\r\n    Hefele, § 324.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe holy council said: After we had reconsidered, according to our promise\r\nmade to your highness,(305) the doctrinal letter written by Sergius, at\r\none time patriarch of this royal God-preserved city, to Cyrus, who was\r\nthen bishop of Phasis, and to Honorius, sometime Pope of Old Rome, as well\r\nas the letter of the latter to the same Sergius, and finding that the\r\ndocuments are quite foreign to the apostolic dogmas, to the definitions of\r\nthe holy councils, and to all the approved Fathers, and that they follow\r\nthe false teachings of the heretics, we entirely reject them, and execrate\r\nthem as hurtful to the soul.\r\n\r\nBut the names of those men whom we execrate must also be thrust forth from\r\nthe holy Church of God, namely, that of Sergius, sometime bishop of this\r\nGod-preserved royal city, who was the first to write on this impious\r\ndoctrine; also that of Cyrus of Alexandria, of Pyrrhus, Paul, and Peter,\r\nwho died bishops of this God-preserved city, and were like-minded with\r\nthem; and that of Theodore, sometime bishop of Pharan, all of whom the\r\nmost holy and thrice-blessed Agatho, Pope of Old Rome, in his suggestion\r\nto our most pious and God-preserved lord and mighty Emperor, rejected\r\nbecause they were minded contrary to our orthodox faith, all of whom we\r\ndeclare are subject to anathema. And with these we decree that there shall\r\nbe expelled from the holy Church of God and anathematized Honorius, who\r\nwas Pope of Old Rome, because of what we found written by him to Sergius,\r\nthat in all respects he followed his view and confirmed his impious\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nWe have also examined the synodal letter(306) of Sophronius, of holy\r\nmemory, sometime patriarch of the holy city of our God, Jerusalem, and\r\nhave found it in accordance with the true faith and with apostolic\r\nteachings, and with the teachings of the holy and approved Fathers.\r\nTherefore, we have received it as orthodox and salutary to the holy and\r\nCatholic and Apostolic Church, and have decreed that it is right that his\r\nname be inserted in the diptychs of the holy churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 108. Rome, Constantinople, and the Lombard State Church in the Seventh\r\nCentury\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sixth General Council was the last great diplomatic triumph of Rome in\r\nthe East in matters of faith, though two centuries after, in the matter of\r\nPhotius, Rome played a brilliant part in the internal affairs of the\r\nEastern Church. Immediately after the council of 681, it was felt that the\r\nWest, of which the Greeks had grown very jealous, had triumphed over the\r\nEast, especially as several of the leading patriarchs had been condemned.\r\nMonotheletism, furthermore, was too strongly intrenched in the East to be\r\nremoved by a single conciliar action. It was felt necessary to take action\r\nto confirm the results of Constantinople in 681. The fifth and sixth\r\ngeneral councils had been occupied entirely with doctrinal matters and had\r\nnot issued any disciplinary canons. A new council might be gathered to\r\ncomplete the work of the Sixth General Council, not only to reaffirm it,\r\nbut in connection with some much-needed legislation to retort upon the\r\nWest by condemning some Roman practices. In this way the Second Trullan\r\nCouncil, or Concilium Quinisextum, came about in 692. The Roman see, in\r\nthe meanwhile, although it had triumphed at Constantinople in 681, did not\r\nenjoy an independent political position in Italy. It was still under the\r\nRoman Emperor at Constantinople, as had been most painfully perceived in\r\nthe treatment of Martin I by Constans. Although the Pope had his\r\napocrisiarius, or nuncio, at Constantinople, he came into immediate\r\ncontact with the exarch of Ravenna, the Emperor’s representative in Italy.\r\nIn Italy, furthermore, the Arian heresy long persisted among the Lombards,\r\nalthough greater toleration was shown the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: The canons of the Quinisext Council\r\n    may be found complete in Percival, _Seven Ecumenical Councils_,\r\n    PNF, ser. II, vol. XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) Concilium Quinisextum, A. D. 692, _Canons_. Bruns, I, 34, _ff._\r\n\r\n\r\n    This council was commonly regarded as the continuation of the\r\n    Sixth General Council, and has been received in the East, not as a\r\n    separate council, but as a part of the sixth. The West has never\r\n    accepted this opinion and has only to a limited extent admitted\r\n    the authority of its canons, though some have been current in the\r\n    West because, like much conciliar action, they were re-enactments\r\n    of older canons. Occasionally some of the canons have been cited\r\n    by popes as belonging to the Sixth Council. The canons given here\r\n    are, for the most part, those which were in some point in\r\n    opposition to the Roman practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 1. _Renewal of the Condemnations of the Sixth Council._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe, by divine grace at the beginning of our decrees, define that the faith\r\nset forth by the God-chosen Apostles, who themselves had both seen the\r\nWord and were ministers of the Word, shall be preserved without any\r\ninnovation, unchanged and inviolate. Moreover the faith of the three\r\nhundred and eighteen holy and blessed Fathers, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Here follows a detailed statement of the first five general\r\n    councils.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso we agree to guard untouched the faith of the Sixth Holy Synod, which\r\nfirst assembled in this royal city in the time of Constantine, our\r\nEmperor, of blessed memory, which faith received still greater\r\nconfirmation from the fact that the pious Emperor ratified with his own\r\nsignet what was written, for the security of every future age. And again\r\nwe confess that we should guard the faith unaltered and openly\r\nacknowledged; that in the Economy of the incarnation of our one Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, the true God, there are two natural wills or volitions and two\r\nnatural operations; and have condemned by a just sentence those who\r\nadulterated the true doctrine and taught the people that in the one Lord,\r\nour God, Jesus Christ, there is but one will and operation, that is to\r\nsay, Theodore of Pharan, Cyrus of Alexandria, Honorius of Rome, Sergius,\r\nPyrrhus, Paul, and Peter, who were bishops of this God-preserved city,\r\nMacarius, who was bishop of Antioch, Stephen who was his disciple, and the\r\ninsane Polychronius, depriving them henceforth of the communion of the\r\nbody of Christ our God.…\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 2. _On the Sources of Canon Law._\r\n\r\n\r\n    This canon opposed Rome in two respects: it accepted eighty-five\r\n    Apostolic Canons, whereas Rome received but fifty; it drew up a\r\n    list of councils and of Fathers whose writings should have\r\n    authority as canons, and omitted the important Western councils,\r\n    except Carthage, and all the papal decrees. With this canon should\r\n    be compared the decretal of Gelasius, _De Libris Recipiendis, v.\r\n    supra_, § 92.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has also seemed good to this holy synod that the eighty-five canons\r\nreceived and ratified by the holy and blessed Fathers before us, and also\r\nhanded down to us in the name of the holy and glorious Apostles, should\r\nfrom this time forth remain firm and unshaken for the cure of souls and\r\nthe healing of disorders. And since in these canons we are bidden to\r\nreceive the _Constitutions of the Holy Apostles_ by Clement, in which, in\r\nold time, certain spurious matter entirely contrary to piety was\r\nintroduced by heterodox persons for the polluting of the Church, which\r\nobscures to us the elegance and beauty of the divine decrees; we,\r\ntherefore, for the edification and security of the most Christian flock,\r\nreject properly such constitutions; by no means admitting the offspring of\r\nheretical error, and cleaving to the pure and perfect doctrine of the\r\nApostles. But we set our seal likewise upon all the other holy canons set\r\nforth by our holy and blessed Fathers, that is, by the three hundred and\r\neighteen God-fearing Fathers assembled at Nicæa, and those at Ancyra;\r\nfurther, those at Neo-Cæsarea and at Gangra, and besides these those at\r\nAntioch in Syria [A. D. 341], those too at Laodicea in Phrygia, and\r\nlikewise those of the one hundred and fifty assembled in this\r\nGod-preserved imperial city and of the two hundred, who assembled for the\r\nfirst time in the metropolis of the Ephesians, and of the six hundred and\r\nthirty holy and blessed Fathers at Chalcedon; in like manner those of\r\nSardica and those of Carthage; those also who assembled in this\r\nGod-preserved imperial city under Nectarius [A. D. 394], and under\r\nTheophilus, archbishop of Alexandria; likewise too the canons(307) of\r\nDionysius, formerly archbishop of the great city of Alexandria, and of\r\nPeter, archbishop of Alexandria, and martyr; of Gregory the Wonder-worker,\r\narchbishop of Neo-Cæsarea; of Athanasius, archbishop of Alexandria; of\r\nBasil, archbishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia; of Gregory, bishop of Nyssa;\r\nof Gregory the Theologian;(308) of Amphilochius of Iconium; of Timothy,\r\narchbishop of Alexandria; of the first Theophilus, archbishop of the same\r\nmetropolis of Alexandria; of Gennadius, patriarch of the God-preserved\r\nimperial city; moreover the canons set forth by Cyprian, archbishop of the\r\ncountry of the Africans, and martyr, and by the synod under him,(309)\r\nwhich have been kept in the country of the aforesaid bishops and only\r\naccording to the custom delivered down to them. And that no one be allowed\r\nto transgress the aforesaid canons, or to receive other canons besides\r\nthem, supposititiously set forth by some who have attempted to make a\r\ntraffic of the truth. But should any one be convicted of innovating upon\r\nthem, or attempting to overturn any of the aforementioned canons, he shall\r\nbe condemned to receive the penalty which the canon imposes and so to be\r\ncured of his transgressions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 13. _On the Marriage of the Clergy._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following canon permits subdeacons and priests if married\r\n    before ordination to continue to live in marriage relations with\r\n    their wives. But they are not allowed to marry a second time or to\r\n    marry a widow. Neither are bishops to remain married; but if they\r\n    are married when elected, their wives must enter a monastery at a\r\n    distance. With this canon should be compared the earlier\r\n    legislation of Nicæa, _v. supra_, § 78, and also the law of\r\n    Justinian, _v. supra_, § 94.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince we know that it is handed down in the canonical discipline in the\r\nRoman Church that those who are about to be deemed worthy of ordination to\r\nthe diaconate or presbyterate should promise no longer to live maritally\r\nwith their wives, we, pursuing the ancient rule of apostolic discipline\r\nand order, will that henceforth the lawful marriage of men in holy orders\r\nremain firm, by no means dissolving their union with their wives, nor\r\ndepriving them of intercourse with each other at a convenient season.…\r\nTherefore, if any one shall have dared, contrary to the Apostolic Canons,\r\nto deprive any one in holy orders, that is, any presbyter, deacon, or\r\nsubdeacon, of cohabitation and intercourse with his lawful wife, let him\r\nbe deposed; likewise also if any presbyter or deacon, on pretence of\r\npiety, puts away his wife, let him be excluded from communion; but if he\r\npersists let him be deposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 36. _On the Rank of the Patriarchal Sees._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rome always rejected the claim of Constantinople to rank as\r\n    second. _Cf._ Leo’s opinion, _v. supra_, § 87.\r\n\r\n\r\nRenewing the enactments of the one hundred and fifty Fathers assembled in\r\nthe God-preserved and imperial city, and the six hundred and thirty\r\nassembled at Chalcedon, we decree that the see of Constantinople shall\r\nenjoy equal privilege with the see of Old Rome, and in ecclesiastical\r\nmatters shall be as highly regarded as that is, and second after it. And\r\nafter this [Constantinople] shall be ranked the see of the great city of\r\nAlexandria, and after that the see of Antioch, and after that the see of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 37. _On Bishops of Sees among Infidels._\r\n\r\n\r\n    This canon is cited here, though not entering into the controversy\r\n    between the East and the West, because it is significant of the\r\n    changed position of the Eastern Church at this time, due to the\r\n    Moslem and other conquests. The Monophysite bishops in Egypt and\r\n    Syria were not molested by the Moslems. This canon marks the\r\n    beginning of the practice of ordaining bishops _in partibus\r\n    infidelium_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince at different times there have been invasions of the barbarians, and\r\nconsequently very many cities have come into the possession of the\r\ninfidels, so that as a consequence the prelate of a city may not be able,\r\nafter he has been ordained, to take possession of his see and to be\r\nsettled in it in sacerdotal order, and so to perform and manage, according\r\nto custom, the ordinations and all other things which appertain to the\r\nbishop; we, preserving the honor and veneration of the priesthood, and in\r\nnowise wishing to make use of the heathen injury to the ruin of\r\necclesiastical rights, have decreed that they who have been thus ordained,\r\nand for the aforesaid causes have not settled in their sees, may be kept\r\nfrom any prejudice from this thing, so that they may canonically perform\r\nthe ordination of the different clerics and use the authority of their\r\noffices according to proper limits, and that whatever administration\r\nproceeds from them may be valid and legitimate. For the exercise of his\r\noffice shall not be circumscribed by reason of necessity, when the exact\r\nobservance of the law is circumscribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 55. _On Fasts in Lent._\r\n\r\n\r\n    As stated in the canon, this enactment is aimed at the Roman\r\n    usage, and refers to the 64th Apostolic Canon, which Rome\r\n    rejected. For the Apostolic Canons, see ANF, VII, 504.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince we have learned that in the city of the Romans, in the holy fast of\r\nLent, they fast on the Sabbaths(310) contrary to the traditional\r\necclesiastical observance, it seemed good to the holy synod that also in\r\nthe Church of the Romans the canons shall be in force without wavering\r\nwhich says: If any cleric shall be found to fast on Sunday or on the\r\nSabbath except on one occasion only,(311) he shall be deposed; and if a\r\nlayman he shall be excommunicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 67. _On Eating Blood._\r\n\r\n\r\n    This canon is less distinctly aimed at Rome. In the West the\r\n    prohibition against eating blood seems to have been little\r\n    observed, as it had been given another interpretation. At the time\r\n    of the Second Trullan Council the practice was very common.\r\n    Augustine, it might be said, did not consider the apostolic\r\n    command as binding except in the special circumstance in which it\r\n    was issued. _Cf._ Augustine, _Contra Faustum_, 32:13.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe divine Scriptures command us to abstain from blood, from things\r\nstrangled, and from fornication. Those, therefore, who, on account of a\r\ndainty stomach, prepare by any art for food the blood of animals and so\r\neat it, we punish suitably. If any one henceforth venture to eat in any\r\nway the blood of an animal, if he be a clergyman let him be deposed; if a\r\nlayman, let him be excommunicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 82. _On Pictures of the Lamb of God._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The custom which is here condemned was prevalent in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some pictures of the holy icons, a lamb is painted to which the\r\nForerunner(312) points his finger, and this is received to serve as a type\r\nof grace, indicating beforehand through the Law our true lamb, Christ our\r\nGod. Embracing therefore the ancient types and shadows as symbols and\r\npatterns of the truth, which have been given to the Church, we prefer\r\n“grace and truth,” receiving it as the fulfilment of the Law. In order,\r\ntherefore, that what is perfect may be delineated to the eyes of all, at\r\nleast in colored expression, we decree that the figure of the lamb who\r\ntaketh away the sin of the world, Christ our God, be henceforth exhibited\r\naccording to human form in the icons, instead of the ancient lamb, so that\r\nall may understand, by means of it, the depth of the humiliation of the\r\nWord of God, and that we may recall to our memory His life in the flesh,\r\nHis passion and salutary death, and the redemption resulting therefrom for\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum_, n. 58.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Notification to the Emperor of an Election of a Pontiff.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The _Liber Diurnus_ was the book of official formulæ used on\r\n    occasions such as elections of pontiffs and the conferring of the\r\n    pallium. It was composed between 685 and 751, and was employed in\r\n    the papal chancellery down to the eleventh century, when it became\r\n    antiquated on account of the changes in the position of the popes.\r\n    The modern editions of the book are by Rozière, Paris, 1869, and\r\n    by Sickel, Vienna, 1889. The text may be found in Mirbt, n. 195,\r\n    where may also be found numerous other useful extracts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it has not been without the merciful divine ordering that, after\r\nthe death of the supreme pontiff, the votes of all should agree in the\r\nelection of one, and that there be perfect harmony so that no one at all\r\nis to be found who would oppose it, it is yet necessary that we ought\r\nobediently to pour forth the prayers of our petitions to our most serene\r\nand most pious lord, who is known to rejoice in the concord of his\r\nsubjects, and graciously to grant what has been asked by them in\r\nunanimity. And so when our Pope (_name_) of most blessed memory died, the\r\nassent of all was given, by the will of God, to the election of (_name_),\r\nthe venerable archdeacon of the Apostolic See, because from the beginning\r\nof his life he had so served the same church, and in all things shown\r\nhimself so able that he ought deservedly to be placed, with the divine\r\napproval, over the ecclesiastical government, especially since by his\r\nconstant association with the aforesaid most blessed pontiff (_name_), he\r\nhas been able to attain to the same distinctions of so great merit, by\r\nwhich the same prelate of holy memory is known to have been adorned, who\r\nby his words always stirred up his mind, being desirous of heavenly joys,\r\nso that whatsoever good we have lost in his predecessor we are confident\r\nthat we have certainly found in him. Therefore, in tears, all we your\r\nservants pray that the piety of the lords may deign to hear the\r\nsupplication of their servants, and the desires of their petitioners may\r\nbe granted by the command of their piety, for the benefit of the Empire,\r\nthat command may be given for his ordination; so that when we have been\r\nplaced by your sacred and exalted clemency under him as our pastor, we may\r\nalways pray for the life and empire of our most serene lords to the Lord\r\nAlmighty and to the blessed Peter, prince of the Apostles, to whose church\r\nit has been granted that a worthy ruler be ordained.\r\n\r\nSubscription of the priests.\r\n\r\nI (_name_), by the mercy of God, presbyter of the holy Roman Church,\r\nconsenting to this action made by us in regard to (_name_), the venerable\r\narchdeacon of the holy Apostolic See and our elected Pope, have\r\nsubscribed.\r\n\r\nSubscription of the laity.\r\n\r\nI (_name_), servant of your piety, consenting to this action drawn up by\r\nus in regard to (_name_), the venerable archdeacon of the holy Apostolic\r\nSee and our elected Pope, have subscribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum_, ch. 60.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Notification of the Election of a Pontiff to the Exarch of\r\n    Ravenna.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The text may be found in part in Mirbt, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the most excellent and exalted lord, graciously to be preserved to us\r\nfor a long life in his princely office (_name_), exarch of Italy, the\r\npriests, deacons, and all the clergy of Rome, the magistrates, the army,\r\nand the people of this city of Rome as suppliants send greeting.\r\n\r\nProvidence is able to give aid in human affairs and to change the weeping\r\nand groaning of the sorrowing into rejoicing.…\r\n\r\nInasmuch as (_name_), of pontifical memory, has been called from present\r\ncares to eternal rest, as is the lot of mortals, a great load of sorrow\r\noppressed us, for as guardians we were deprived of our own guardian. But\r\nthe accustomed kindness of our God did not permit us to remain long in\r\nthis affliction because we hoped in Him. For after we had humbly spent\r\nthree days in prayer that the heavenly kindness might, for the merits of\r\nall, make known whom as worthy it commanded to be elected to succeed to\r\nthe apostolic office, with the aid of His grace which inspired the minds\r\nof all; and after we had assembled as is customary, that is, the clergy\r\nand the people of Rome with the presence of the nobility and the army,\r\nfrom the least to the greatest, so to speak; and the election, with the\r\nhelp of God and the aid of the holy Apostles, fell upon the person of\r\n(_name_), the most holy archdeacon of this holy Apostolic See of the Roman\r\nChurch. The good and chaste life of this man, beloved of God, was in the\r\nopinion of all so deserving that none opposed his election, no one was\r\nabsent, and none dissented from it. For why should not men agree\r\nunanimously upon him whom the incomparable and unfailing providence of our\r\nGod had foreordained to this office? For without doubt this had been\r\ndetermined upon in the presence of God. So solemnly performing his decrees\r\nand confirming with our signatures the desires of hearts concerning his\r\nelection, we have sent you our fellow-servants as the bearers of this\r\nletter (_names_), most holy bishop (_name_), venerable presbyter (_name_),\r\nregionary notary (_name_), regionary subdeacons (_names_), honorable\r\ncitizens, and from the most flourishing and successful Roman army\r\n(_name_), most eminent consul, and (_names_) chief men, tribunes of the\r\narmy, begging and praying together that your excellency, whom may God\r\npreserve, may with your accustomed goodness agree with our pious choice;\r\nbecause he, who has been unanimously elected by our humility, is such that\r\nso far as human discernment is able to see, no spot of reproach appears in\r\nhim. And therefore we beg and beseech you, by God’s inspiration, to grant\r\nour petition quickly, because there are many questions and other matters\r\narising daily which require for remedy the care of pontifical favor. And\r\nthe affairs of the province and the need of causes connected therewith\r\nalso seek and await the control of due authority. Besides we need some one\r\nto keep the neighboring enemy in check, which can only be done by the\r\npower of God, and of the Prince of the Apostles through his vicar, the\r\nbishop of Rome; since it is well known that at various times the bishop of\r\nRome has driven off enemies by his warnings, and at other times he has\r\nturned aside and restrained them by his prayers; so that by his words\r\nalone, on account of their reverence for the Prince of the Apostles, they\r\nhave offered voluntary obedience, and thus they, whom the force of arms\r\nhad not overcome, have yielded to the warnings and prayers of the Pope.\r\n\r\nSince these things are so, we again and again beseech you, our exalted\r\nlord, preserved by God, that, with the aid and inspiration of God in your\r\nheart, you may quickly give orders to adorn the Apostolic See by the\r\ncompleted ordination of the same, our father. And we, your humble\r\nservants, on seeing our desires fulfilled, may then give unceasing thanks\r\nto God and to you, and with our spiritual pastor, our bishop, enthroned in\r\nthe Apostolic Seat, we may pour out prayers for the life and health and\r\ncomplete victories of our most exalted and Christian lords (_names_), the\r\ngreat and victorious emperors, that the merciful God may give manifold\r\nvictories to their royal courage, and cause them to triumph over all\r\npeoples, and that God may give them joy of heart, because the ancient rule\r\nof Rome has been restored. For we know that he whom we have elected Pope\r\ncan, with his prayers, influence the divine omnipotence; and he has\r\nprepared a joyful increase for the Roman Empire, and he will aid you in\r\nthis, in the government of this province of Italy, which is subject to\r\nyou, and will aid and protect all of us, your servants, through many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSubscription of the priests.\r\n\r\nI, (_name_), the humble archpriest of the holy Roman Church, have with\r\nfull consent subscribed to this document which we have made concerning\r\n(_name_), most holy archdeacon, our bishop elect.\r\n\r\nAnd the subscription of the laity.\r\n\r\nI, (_name_), in the name of God, consul, have with full consent subscribed\r\nto this document which we have made concerning (_name_), most holy\r\narchdeacon, our bishop-elect.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) Paulus Diaconus, _Hist. Langobardorum_, IV, 44. (MSL, 95:581.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Agilulf may have been a convert to the Catholic faith, _v. supra_,\r\n    § 99. His successors were not. In fact, not until 653, when\r\n    Aribert, the nephew of Theodelinda, ascended the throne, were the\r\n    Lombards permanently under Catholic rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n44. After Ariwald (626-636) had reigned twelve years over the Lombards he\r\ndeparted this life, and Rothari of the family of Arodus took the kingdom\r\nof the Lombards. He was a strong, brave man, and walked in the paths of\r\njustice; in Christian faith, however, he did not hold to the right way,\r\nbut was polluted by the unbelief of the Arian heresy. The Arians say, to\r\ntheir confusion, that the Son is inferior to the Father and, in the same\r\nway, the Holy Ghost is inferior to the Father and the Son; we, Catholic\r\nChristians, on the contrary, confess that the Father and the Son and the\r\nHoly Ghost are one true God in three persons, equal in power and glory. In\r\nthe times of Rothari there were in nearly all the cities of his kingdom\r\ntwo bishops, a Catholic and an Arian.\r\n\r\nTo this very day there is shown in the city of Ticinus [Pavia] the place\r\nwhere the Arian bishop resided, at the church of St. Eusebius, and held\r\nthe baptistery while the Catholic bishop was at the head of another\r\nchurch. The Arian bishop, however, who was in this city, whose name was\r\nAnastasius, accepted the Catholic faith and afterward ruled the Church of\r\nChrist. This king Rothari caused the laws of the Lombards to be reduced to\r\nwriting and named the book _The Edict_; the law of the Lombards up to that\r\ntime had been retained merely in memory and by their use in the courts.\r\nThis took place, as the king in the preface to his law-book says, in the\r\nseventy-seventh year(313) after the Lombards came into Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 109. Rome, Constantinople, and the Lombards in the Period of the First\r\nIconoclastic Controversy; the Seventh General Council, Nicæa, A. D. 787\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the eight century the veneration of pictures or icons had become\r\nwide-spread throughout the Eastern Church. Apart from their due place in\r\nthe cultus, grave abuses and superstitions had arisen in many parts of the\r\nChurch in connection with the icons. To Leo III the Isaurian (717-741),\r\nand to the army, the veneration of the icons, as practised by the\r\npopulace, and especially by the monks, seemed but little removed from the\r\ngrossest idolatry. Accordingly, in an edict issued in 726, Leo attempted\r\nto put an end to the abuses by preventing all veneration of the icons.\r\nMeeting with opposition, his measures passed from moderate to severe. In\r\nItaly, although the use of icons was not developed to the same extent as\r\nin the East, sympathy was entirely against the Iconoclasts. Gregory II\r\n(715-731) and Gregory III (731-741) bitterly reproached and denounced the\r\naction of the Emperor. Nearly all the exarchate willingly passed under the\r\npower of the Lombards. Other parts of northern Italy also broke with the\r\nEmperor. Leo retaliated by annexing Illyricum to the see of Constantinople\r\nand confiscating the papal revenues in southern Italy. From that time the\r\nconnection between the Pope and the Emperor was very slight. The Emperor\r\nConstantine V Copronymus (741-775) was more severe than his father, and in\r\nmany respects even fiercely brutal in his treatment of the monks. A synod\r\nwas assembled at Constantinople, 754, attended by three hundred and\r\nthirty-eight bishops, who, as was customary in Eastern synods, supported\r\nthe Emperor. His son, Leo IV Chazarus (775-780) was less energetic and\r\ndisposed to tolerate the use of icons in private. But his widow, Irene,\r\nthe guardian of her infant son, Constantine VI, was determined to restore\r\nthe images or icons. A synod held at Constantinople in 786 was broken up\r\nby the soldiery of the capital. In 787 at Nicæa, a council was called at a\r\nsafe distance and Iconoclasm was condemned.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional source material: _St. John Damascene on Holy Images_,\r\n    Eng. trans. by Mary H.

It is hardly likely that the Emperor ordered the\r\n    death of the pontiff as recorded, and more probable that his\r\n    over-officious representatives regarded it as a means of\r\n    ingratiating themselves with their master. The passage is strictly\r\n    contemporaneous, as the _Liber Pontificalis_, at least in this\r\n    part, is composed of brief biographies of Popes written\r\n    immediately after their decease and in some instances during their\r\n    lives. For a fuller statement of the whole period, see Hefele, §§\r\n    332 _ff._, who gives an abstract of the following and also of two\r\n    letters alleged to have been written by Gregory II to the Emperor,\r\n    which Hefele accepts as genuine. For a criticism of these letters,\r\n    see Hodgkin, _op. cit._, VI, 501-505. Hodgkin gives an excellent\r\n    account of King Liutprand in ch. XII of the same volume, pp.\r\n    437-508, and throws much light on the following passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the events immediately preceding this, see Paulus Diaconus,\r\n    _Hist. Langobardorum_, VI, 46-48, given above in § 106. Paulus\r\n    refers to the capture of Narnia in the last sentence of ch. 48.\r\n    and his next chapter is apparently a condensation of the following\r\n    sections of the official papal biography.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time [_circa_ A. D. 725] Narnia(314) was taken by the Lombards.\r\nAnd Liutprand, the king of the Lombards, advanced upon Ravenna with his\r\nentire army, and besieged it for some days. Taking the fortress of\r\nClassis, he bore off many captives and immense booty. After some time the\r\nduke Basilius, the chartularius Jordanes, and the subdeacon John, surnamed\r\nLurion, conspired to kill the Pope; and Marinus, the imperial spatarius,\r\nwho at that time held the government of the duchy of Rome, having been\r\nsent by the command of the Emperor to the royal city, joined their\r\nconspiracy. But they could not find an opportunity. The plot was broken up\r\nby the judgment of God, and he therefore left Rome. Later Paulus, the\r\npatrician, was sent as exarch to Italy, who planned how at length he might\r\naccomplish the crime; but their plans were disclosed to the Romans, These\r\nwere so enraged that they killed Jordanes and John Lurion. Basilius,\r\nhowever, became a monk and ended his life hidden in a certain place. But\r\nthe exarch Paulus, on the command of the Emperor, tried to kill the\r\npontiff because he hindered the levying of a tax upon the province,\r\nintending to strip the churches of their property, as was done in other\r\nplaces, and to appoint another [Pope] in his place. After this another\r\nspatarius was sent with commands to remove the pontiff from his seat. Then\r\nagain the patrician Paulus sent, for the accomplishment of this crime,\r\nsuch soldiers as he could withdraw from Ravenna, with his guard and some\r\nfrom the camps. But the Romans were aroused, and from all sides the\r\nLombards gathered for the defence of the pontiff at the bridge of Solario,\r\nin the district of Spoleto, and the dukes of the Lombards, surrounding the\r\nRoman territories, prevented this crime.\r\n\r\nIn a decree afterward sent, the Emperor ordered that there no longer\r\nshould be in any church an image(315) of any saint, or martyr, or angel\r\n(for he said that all these were accursed); and if the pontiff assented he\r\nshould enjoy his favor, but if he prevented the accomplishment of this\r\nalso he should fall from his position. The pious man, despising therefore\r\nthe profane command of the prince, armed himself against the Emperor as\r\nagainst an enemy, rejecting this heresy and writing everywhere to warn\r\nChristians of the impiety which had arisen.\r\n\r\nAroused by this, the inhabitants of the Pentapolis(316) and the armies of\r\nVenetia resisted the command of the Emperor, saying that they would never\r\nassent to the murder of the pontiff, but on the contrary would strive\r\nmanfully for his defence. They anathematized the exarch Paulus, him who\r\nhad sent him, and those who sided with him, refusing to obey them; and\r\nthroughout Italy all chose leaders(317) for themselves, so eager were all\r\nconcerning the pontiff and his safety. When the iniquities of the Emperor\r\nwere known, all Italy started to choose for itself an emperor and conduct\r\nhim to Constantinople, but the pontiff prevented this plan, hoping for the\r\nconversion of the prince.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in those days, the duke Exhiliratus,(318) deceived by the\r\ninstigation of the devil, with his son Adrian, occupied parts of Campania,\r\npersuading the people to obey the Emperor and kill the pontiff. Then all\r\nthe Romans pursued after him, took him, and killed both him and his son.\r\nAfter this they chased away the duke Peter [governor of Rome under the\r\nEmperor], saying that he had written against the pontiff to the Emperor.\r\nWhen, therefore, a dissension arose in and about Ravenna, some consenting\r\nto the wickedness of the Emperor and some holding to the pontiff and those\r\nfaithful to him, a great fight took place between them and they killed the\r\npatrician Paulus [exarch at that time]. And the cities of Castra Æmilia,\r\nFerrorianus, Montebelli, Verabulum, with its towns, Buxo, Persiceta, the\r\nPentapolis, and Auximanum, surrendered to the Lombards.(319) After this\r\nthe Emperor sent to Naples Eutychius Fratricius, the eunuch, who had\r\nformerly been exarch, to accomplish what the exarch Paulus, the spatarii,\r\nand the other evil counsellors had been unable to do. But by God’s\r\nordering his miserable craft was not so hidden but that his most wicked\r\nplot was disclosed to all, that he would attempt to violate the churches\r\nof Christ, to destroy all, and to take away the property of all. When he\r\nhad sent one of his own men to Rome with written instructions, among other\r\nthings, that the pontiff should be killed, together with the chief men of\r\nRome, this most bloody outrage was discovered, and the Romans would at\r\nonce have killed the messenger of the patrician if the opposition of the\r\nPope had not prevented them. But they anathematized the same exarch\r\nEutychius, binding themselves, great and small, by an oath, never to\r\npermit the pontiff, the zealous guardian of the Christian faith and the\r\ndefender of the churches, to be killed or removed, but to be ready all to\r\ndie for his safety. Thereupon the patrician [Eutychius], promising many\r\ngifts to the dukes and to the king of the Lombards, attempted to persuade\r\nthem by his messengers to abandon the support of the pontiff. But they\r\ndespised the man’s detestable wiles contained in his letters; and the\r\nRomans and the Lombards bound themselves as brothers in the bond of faith,\r\nall desiring to suffer a glorious death for the pontiff, and never to\r\npermit him to receive any harm, contending for the true faith and the\r\nsalvation of Christians. While they were doing this that father chose, as\r\na stronger protection, to distribute with his own hand such alms to the\r\npoor as he found; giving himself to prayers and fastings, he besought the\r\nLord daily with litanies, and he remained always more supported by this\r\nhope than by men; however, he thanked the people for their offer, and with\r\ngentle words he besought all to serve God with good deeds and to remain\r\nsteadfast in the faith; and he admonished them not to renounce their love\r\nand fidelity to the Roman Emperor.\r\n\r\nAt that time in the eleventh indiction,(320) the castle of Sutri was taken\r\nby the Lombards by craft, and was held by them for a period of forty\r\ndays,(321) but urged by the constant letters of the pontiff and warnings\r\nsent to the king, when very many gifts had been made, as a gift at least\r\nfor all the towns, the king of the Lombards restored them and gave them as\r\na donation to the most blessed Apostles Peter and Paul. At the same time,\r\nin the twelfth indiction [A. D. 729], in the month of January, for ten\r\ndays and more, a star, called Gold-bearing,(322) with rays, appeared in\r\nthe west. Its rays were toward the north and reached to the midst of the\r\nheavens. At that time, also, the patrician Eutychius and King Liutprand\r\nmade a most wicked agreement, that when an army had been gathered the king\r\nshould subject Spoleto and Beneventum,(323) and the exarch of Rome, and\r\nthey should carry out what was already commanded concerning the pontiff.\r\nWhen the king came to Spoleto, oaths and hostages were received from both\r\n[_i.e._, the dukes of Spoleto and Beneventum], and he came with all his\r\ntroops to the Campus Neronis.(324) The pontiff went forth and presented\r\nhimself before him and endeavored to the extent of his ability to soften\r\nthe mind of the king by pious warnings, so that the king threw himself at\r\nhis feet and promised to harm no one; and he was so moved to compunction\r\nby the pious warnings that he abandoned his undertaking and laid on the\r\ngrave of the Apostle his mantle, his military cloak, his sword belt, his\r\nshort two-edged sword, and his golden sword, as well as a golden crown and\r\na silver cross. After prayer he besought the pontiff to consent to make\r\npeace with the exarch, which also was done. So he departed, for the king\r\nforsook the bad designs with which he had entered into the plot with the\r\nexarch. While the exarch remained in Rome, there came into Tuscany to\r\nCastrum Maturianense,(325) a certain deceiver, Tiberius by name, called\r\nalso Petasius,(326) who attempted to usurp the rule of the Roman Empire\r\nand deceived some of the less important, so that Maturianum, Luna, and\r\nBlera [Bieda] took oath to him. The exarch, hearing of this, was troubled,\r\nbut the most holy Pope supported him, and, sending with him his chief men\r\nand an army, he advanced and came to Castrum Maturianense. Petasius was\r\nkilled, his head was cut off and sent to Constantinople, to the prince;\r\nnevertheless the Emperor showed no great favor to the Romans.\r\n\r\nAfter these things the malice of the Emperor became evident, on account of\r\nwhich he had persecuted the pontiff. For he compelled all the inhabitants\r\nof Constantinople, by force and persuasion, to displace the images of the\r\nSaviour as well as of His holy mother, and of all saints, wherever they\r\nwere, and (what is horrible to tell) to burn them in the fire in the\r\nmiddle of the city, and to whitewash all the painted churches. Because\r\nvery many of the people of the city withstood the commission of such an\r\nenormity, they were subjected to punishment; some were beheaded, others\r\nlost a part of their body. For this reason also, because Germanus, the\r\nprelate of the church of Constantinople, was unwilling to consent to this,\r\nthe Emperor deprived him of his pontifical position, and appointed in his\r\nplace the presbyter Anastasius, an accomplice. Anastasius sent to the Pope\r\na synodical letter, but when that holy man saw that he held the same\r\nerror, he did not regard him as brother and fellow-priest, but wrote him\r\nwarning letters, commanding him to be put out of his sacerdotal office\r\nunless he returned to the Catholic faith. He also charged the Emperor,\r\nurging wholesome advice, that he should desist from such execrable\r\nwickedness, and he warned him by letter.(327)\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) John of Damascus, _De Fide Orthodoxa_, IV, 16. (MSG, 94:1168.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    John of Damascus (_ob. ante_ 754) was the last of the Church\r\n    Fathers of the East. He became the classical representative of the\r\n    theology of the Eastern Church, and his system forms the\r\n    conclusion and summing up of the results of all the great\r\n    controversies that had distracted that part of the Church. His\r\n    greatest work, _De Fide Orthodoxa_, may be found translated in\r\n    PNF. In the following chapter John sums up briefly the arguments\r\n    which he uses in his three orations _In Defence of Images_ (to be\r\n    found in MSG, 94:1227 _ff._; for translation see head of section).\r\n    By images one should understand pictures rather than statues. The\r\n    latter were never common and fell entirely out of use and were\r\n    forbidden. They seemed too closely akin to idols. In the\r\n    translation, the phrase “to show reverence” is the equivalent of\r\n    the Greek προσκυνέω.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince some find fault with us for showing reverence and honoring the image\r\nof our Saviour and that of our Lady, and also of the rest of the saints\r\nand servants of Christ, let them hear that from the beginning God made man\r\nafter His own image. On what other grounds, then, do we show reverence to\r\neach other than that we are made after God’s image? For as Basil, that\r\nmost learned expounder of divine things, says: “The honor given to the\r\nimage passes over to the prototype.”(328) Now a prototype is that which is\r\nimaged, from which the form is derived. Why was it that the Mosaic people\r\nshowed reverence round about the tabernacle which bore an image and type\r\nof heavenly things, or rather the whole creation? God, indeed, said to\r\nMoses: “Look that thou make all things after the pattern which was shewed\r\nthee in the mount” [Ex. 33:10]. The Cherubim, also, which overshadowed the\r\nmercy-seat, are they not the work of men’s hands? What is the renowned\r\ntemple at Jerusalem? Is it not made by hands and fashioned by the skill of\r\nmen? The divine Scriptures, however, blame those who show reverence to\r\ngraven images, but also those who sacrifice to demons. The Greeks\r\nsacrificed and the Jews also sacrificed; but the Greeks to demons; the\r\nJews, however, to God. And the sacrifice of the Greeks was rejected and\r\ncondemned, but the sacrifice of the just was acceptable to God. For Noah\r\nsacrificed, and God smelled a sweet savor of a good purpose, receiving,\r\nalso, the fragrance of a good-will toward Him. And so the graven images of\r\nthe Greeks, since they were the images of demon deities, were rejected and\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nBut besides this, who can make an imitation of the invisible, incorporeal,\r\nuncircumscribed, and formless God? Therefore to give form to the Deity is\r\nthe height of folly and impiety. And therefore in the Old Testament the\r\nuse of images was repressed. But after God, in the bowels of His mercy,\r\nbecame for our salvation in truth man, not as He was seen by Abraham in\r\nthe semblance of a man, or by the prophets, but He became in truth man,\r\naccording to substance, and after He lived upon earth and dwelt among men,\r\nworked miracles, suffered, and was crucified, He rose again, and was\r\nreceived up into heaven; since all these things actually took place and\r\nwere seen by men, they were written for the remembrance and instruction of\r\nus who were not present at that time, in order that, though we saw not, we\r\nmay still, hearing and believing, obtain the blessing of the Lord. But\r\nsince all have not a knowledge of letters nor time for reading, it\r\nappeared good to the Fathers that those events, as acts of heroism, should\r\nbe depicted on images(329) to be a brief memorial of them. Often,\r\ndoubtless, when we have not the Lord’s passion in mind and see the image\r\nof Christ’s crucifixion, we remember the passion and we fall down and show\r\nreverence not to the material but to that which is imaged; just as we do\r\nnot show reverence to the material of the Gospel, nor to the material of\r\nthe cross, but that which these typify.(330) For wherein does the cross\r\nthat typifies the Lord differ from a cross that does not do so? It is the\r\nsame also as to the case of the Mother of God.(331) For the honor which is\r\ngiven her is referred to Him who was incarnate of her. And similarly also\r\nthe brave acts of holy men stir us to bravery and to emulation and\r\nimitation of their valor and to the glory of God. For, as we said, the\r\nhonor that is given to the best of fellow servants is a proof of good-will\r\ntoward our common lady, and the honor rendered the image passes over to\r\nthe prototype. But this is an unwritten tradition, just as is also to show\r\nreverence toward the East and to the cross, and very many similar\r\nthings.(332)\r\n\r\nA certain tale is told also that when Augarus [_i.e._, Abgarus] was king\r\nover the city of the Edessenes, he sent a portrait-painter to paint a\r\nlikeness of the Lord; and when the painter could not paint because of the\r\nbrightness that shone from His countenance, the Lord himself put a garment\r\nover His divine and life-giving face and impressed on it an image of\r\nHimself, and sent this to Augarus to satisfy in this way his desire.\r\n\r\nMoreover, that the Apostles handed down much that was unwritten, Paul the\r\nApostle of the Gentiles writes: Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold\r\nthe traditions which ye have been taught of us, whether by word or by\r\nepistles [II Thess. 2:14]. And to the Corinthians he writes: Now I praise\r\nyou, brethren, that ye remembered me in all things and keep the traditions\r\nas I have delivered them to you [I Cor. 2:2].\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Basil the Great, _De Spiritu Sancto_, ch. 18. (MSG, 32:149.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Basil is speaking of the three persons of the Trinity, and says\r\n    that although we speak of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, we must\r\n    not count up “by way of addition gradually increasing from unity\r\n    to multitude,” but that number must be understood otherwise in\r\n    speaking of the three divine persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow then, if one and one, are there not two Gods? Because we speak of a\r\nking and of the king’s image, and not of two kings. The power is not\r\nparted nor the glory divided. The power ruling over us is one, and the\r\nauthority one, and so also the doxology ascribed by us is one and not\r\nplural; because the honor paid to the image passes over to the prototype.\r\n\r\nNow what in the one case the image is by reason of imitation, that in the\r\nother case the Son is by nature; and as in works of art the likeness is\r\ndependent upon the form, so in the case of the divine and uncompounded\r\nnature the union consists in the communion of the godhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) The Seventh General Council, Nicæa, A.

XIV, see Mendham,\r\n    _The Seventh General Council, the Second of Nicæa, in which the\r\n    Worship of Images was Established; with copious notes from the\r\n    __“__Caroline Books,__”__ compiled by order of Charlemagne for its\r\n    Confutation_, London, n. d.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe holy, great and ecumenical synod which, by the grace of God and the\r\ncommand of the pious and Christ-loving Emperors, Constantine, and Irene\r\nhis mother, was gathered together for the second time at Nicæa, the\r\nillustrious metropolis of the eparchy of Bithynia, in the holy Church of\r\nGod which is named Sophia, having followed the tradition of the Catholic\r\nChurch, hath defined as follows:\r\n\r\nChrist our Lord, who hath bestowed upon us the light of the knowledge of\r\nHimself, and hath redeemed us from the darkness of idolatrous madness,\r\nhaving espoused to Himself His holy Catholic Church without spot or\r\ndefect, promised that He would so preserve her; and assured His holy\r\ndisciples, saying, “I am with you always, even unto the end of the world”\r\n[Matt. 28:20], which promise He made, not only to them, but to us also who\r\nthrough them should believe in His name. But some, not considering this\r\ngift, and having become fickle through the temptation of the wily enemy,\r\nhave fallen from the right faith; for, withdrawing from the tradition of\r\nthe Catholic Church, they have erred from the knowledge of the truth, and\r\nas the proverb saith: “The husbandmen have gone astray in their own\r\nhusbandry, and have gathered in their hands sterility,” because certain\r\npriests in deed, but not priests in reality, had dared to slander the\r\nGod-approved ornaments of the sacred monuments. Of whom God cries aloud\r\nthrough the prophet: “Many pastors have corrupted my vineyard, they have\r\npolluted my portion” [Jer. 12:10; _cf._ LXX]. And, forsooth, following\r\nprofane men, trusting to their own senses, they have calumniated His holy\r\nChurch espoused to Christ our God, and have not distinguished between holy\r\nand profane, styling the images of the Lord and of His saints by the same\r\nname as the statute of diabolical idols. Seeing which things, our Lord God\r\n(not willing to behold His people corrupted by such manner of plague) hath\r\nof His good pleasure called us together, the chief of His priests, from\r\nevery quarter, moved with a divine zeal and brought hither by the will of\r\nour Emperors, Constantine and Irene, to the end that the divine tradition\r\nof the Catholic Church may receive stability by our common decree.\r\nTherefore, with all diligence, making a thorough examination and\r\ninvestigation, and following the trend of the truth, diminishing naught,\r\nadding naught, we preserve unchanged all things which pertain to the\r\nCatholic Church, and following the six ecumenical synods, especially that\r\nwhich met in this illustrious metropolis of Nicæa, as also that which was\r\nafterward gathered together in the God-preserved royal city.\r\n\r\nWe believe in one God … life of the world to come. Amen.(333)\r\n\r\nWe detest and anathematize Arius and all who agree with him and share his\r\nabsurd opinion; also Macedonius and those who, following him, are well\r\nstyled foes of the Spirit.(334) We confess that our lady, St. Mary, is\r\nproperly and truly the Theotokos, because she bore, after the flesh, one\r\nof the Holy Trinity, to wit, Christ our God, as the Council of Ephesus has\r\nalready defined, when it cast out of the Church the impious Nestorius with\r\nhis allies, because he introduced a personal [προσωπικὴν] duality [in\r\nChrist]. With the Fathers of this synod we confess the two natures of Him\r\nwho was incarnate for us of the immaculate Theotokos and ever-Virgin Mary,\r\nrecognizing Him as perfect God and perfect man, as also the Council of\r\nChalcedon hath promulgated, expelling from the divine Atrium as\r\nblasphemers, Eutyches and Dioscurus; and placing with them Severus, Peter,\r\nand a number of others blaspheming in divers fashions. Moreover, with\r\nthese we anathematize the fables of Origen, Evagrius, and Didymus, in\r\naccordance with the decision of the Fifth Council held at Constantinople.\r\nWe affirm that in Christ there are two wills and operations according to\r\nthe reality of each nature, as also the Sixth Council held at\r\nConstantinople taught, casting out Sergius, Honorius, Cyrus, Pyrrhus,\r\nMacarius, and those who are unwilling to be reverent and who agree with\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nTo make our confession short, we keep unchanged all the ecclesiastical\r\ntraditions handed down to us, written or unwritten, and of these one is\r\nthe making of pictorial representations, agreeable to the history of the\r\npreaching of the Gospel, a tradition useful in many respects, but\r\nespecially in this, that so the incarnation of the Word of God is shown\r\nforth as real and not merely fantastic, for these have mutual indications,\r\nand without doubt have also mutual significations.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, following the royal pathway and the divinely inspired\r\nauthority of our holy Fathers and the traditions of the Catholic Church\r\nfor, as we all know, the Holy Spirit dwells in her, define with all\r\ncertitude and accuracy, that just as the figure of the precious and\r\nlife-giving cross, so also the venerable and holy images, as well in\r\npainting and mosaic, as of other fit materials, should be set forth in the\r\nholy churches of God, and on the sacred vessels and on the vestments and\r\non hangings and in tablets both in houses and by the wayside, to wit, the\r\nfigure of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, of our spotless lady, the\r\nTheotokos, of the venerable angels, of all saints, and of all pious\r\npeople. For by so much the more frequently as they are seen in artistic\r\nrepresentation, by so much the more readily are men lifted up to the\r\nmemory of their prototypes, and to a longing after them; and to these\r\nshould be given due salutation and honorable reverence [ἀσπασμὸν καὶ\r\nτιμητικὴν προσκύνησιν], not indeed that true worship [τὴν ἀληθινὴν\r\nλατρείαν] which pertains alone to the divine nature; but to these, as to\r\nthe figure of the precious and life-giving cross, and to the book of the\r\nGospels and to other holy objects, incense and lights may be offered\r\naccording to ancient pious custom. For the honor which is paid to the\r\nimage passes on to that which the image represents, and he who shows\r\nreverence [προσκυνεῖ] to the image shows reverence to the subject\r\nrepresented in it. For thus the teaching of our holy Fathers, which is\r\ncalled the tradition of the Catholic Church, which from one end of the\r\nearth to the other hath received the Gospel, is strengthened. Thus we\r\nfollow Paul, who spake in Christ, and the whole divine Apostolic company\r\nand the holy Fathers, holding fast the traditions which we have received.\r\nSo we sing prophetically the triumphal hymns of the Church: Rejoice\r\ngreatly, O daughter of Sion; Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Rejoice and\r\nbe glad with all thy heart. The Lord hath taken away from thee the\r\noppression of thy adversaries; thou art redeemed from the hand of thy\r\nenemies: The Lord is a king in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil\r\nany more, and peace be unto thee forever.\r\n\r\nThose, therefore, who dare to think or teach otherwise, or as wicked\r\nheretics dare to spurn the traditions of the Church and to invent some\r\nnovelty, or else to reject some of those things which the Church hath\r\nreceived, to wit, the book of the Gospels, or the image of the cross, or\r\nthe pictorial icons, or the holy relics of a martyr, or evilly and sharply\r\nto devise anything subversive of the lawful traditions of the Catholic\r\nChurch, or to turn to common uses the sacred vessels and the venerable\r\nmonasteries, if they be bishops or clerics we command that they be\r\ndeposed; if religious(335) or laics, that they be cut off from communion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Analytical Table of Contents at the opening of this volume should be\r\nused to supplement this Index.\r\n\r\nAcacius of Constantinople, 526, 536.\r\n\r\nAdoptionists, 172.\r\n\r\nAdvent, second.

Harnack,\r\n      and Th. Zahn, Leipsic, 1876, 1877, reprinted 1894 and since.\r\n\r\n      _Opera Patrum Apostolicorum_, edited by F. X. Funk, Tübingen, 1881.\r\n      There is a very inexpensive reprint of the text in Krüger’s\r\n      _Sammlung ausgewählter kirchen- und dogmengeschichtlicher\r\n      Quellenschriften_, 2te Reihe, 1 Heft. Funk’s text is used in the\r\n      following sections, but as the Apostolic Fathers are everywhere\r\n      accessible no references are given to Migne.\r\n\r\n      _The Apostolic Fathers_, edited by J. B. Lightfoot, second ed., part\r\n      I, 2 vols. (Clement of Rome), London, 1890; part II, 3 vols.\r\n      (Ignatius and Polycarp), London, 1889; smaller ed. (containing all\r\n      the Apostolic Fathers), London. 1890.\r\n\r\n      The most recent edition of the Apostolic Fathers is that of Kirsopp\r\n      Lake, in the _Loeb Classical Library_, 1912 (text and translation on\r\n      opposite pages).\r\n\r\n_    5 Cf._ Matt. 24:6, 22; Mark 13:7, 20. These words do not occur in the\r\n      book of Enoch.\r\n\r\n    6 The writer quotes Ex. 31:18; 34:28; 32:7; Deut. 9:12.\r\n\r\n_    7 I.e._, so that they believed that circumcision should be made in\r\n      the flesh and not taken spiritually.\r\n\r\n    8 ΙΗ or Ιη = Ἰησους. T was taken as a picture of a cross. For the Tau\r\n      or Egyptian cross, see DCA, art. “Cross.” The method of allegorical\r\n      interpretation here used is that species known as gematria, in which\r\n      the numerical equivalence of letters composing a word is employed as\r\n      a key to mystic meaning. This differs somewhat from the ordinary\r\n      gematria, for which see Farrar, _History of Interpretation_, 1886,\r\n      pp. 98 _ff._, 445 _f._ Barnabas is by no means singular among early\r\n      Christians in resorting to Jewish allegorical interpretation.\r\n\r\n    9 For the same charge brought against the Jews of stirring up\r\n      hostility against the Christians, see Tertullian, _Ad Nationes_, I,\r\n      14; _Adv. Marcionem_, III, 23; _Adv. Judæos_, 13; Origen, _Contra\r\n      Celsum_, VI, 27.\r\n\r\n_   10 Cf._ Mai. 1:10-12.\r\n\r\n   11 The Christians at Rome seem, according to this statement, to have\r\n      been in such a position that they might be able to interfere in the\r\n      case of prisoners.\r\n\r\n   12 A possible reference to the presence of Peter and Paul at Rome, but\r\n      by no means certain, as epistolatory commands would fulfil the\r\n      conditions better. The connection of Peter with Rome, however, is\r\n      very significant.\r\n\r\n   13 It can not be concluded from this that Ignatius was of servile\r\n      condition. His journey to Rome in chains might be enough here to\r\n      explain the language, especially when the style of Ignatius is\r\n      considered.\r\n\r\n   14 Such were evidently Gnostics, as shown by their rejection of the God\r\n      of the Jews.\r\n\r\n   15 Piaculum.\r\n\r\n   16 Clement alters the passage slightly; see Is. 60:17.\r\n\r\n   17 The Greek is ἐπισκοπή (_episcopē_), meaning primarily “oversight.”\r\n\r\n   18 This seems to be the occasion for this letter to the Corinthians. As\r\n      they appear to be several, they correspond to presbyters rather than\r\n      to bishops, and the use of the term “presbyters” in the passage\r\n      sustains this interpretation.\r\n\r\n   19 The word rendered daily is ἐπιοὑσιον, the same as that used in Matt.\r\n      6:11.\r\n\r\n   20 Note the doxology also at the end of the other prayers.\r\n\r\n   21 The sense is: If a prophet speaking in the Spirit commands a meal to\r\n      be prepared for the poor and should himself eat of it, it would be\r\n      apparent that he ordered it for himself. But if he eats he must be a\r\n      false prophet.\r\n\r\n   22 A most difficult and obscure passage. Various interpretations have\r\n      been proposed; see the various editions of the Apostolic Fathers,\r\n      especially Funk’s. The rendering here given is strictly literal.\r\n\r\n   23 This passage is quoted at length by Clement of Alexandria,\r\n      _Stromata_, II, 12, 13.\r\n\r\n   24 The first part of this quotation has not been identified; the\r\n      conclusion is Matt. 7:23.\r\n\r\n_   25 Cf._ Acts 2:9 _ff._\r\n\r\n   26 Probably Palestine is here meant.\r\n\r\n   27 The great Syrian goddess Atargatis.\r\n\r\n   28 Reference is obscure.\r\n\r\n   29 A reference to astrological doctrine.\r\n\r\n   30 There is good reason for believing that by India is meant what is\r\n      now understood as India, and not Arabia. There was no little\r\n      intercourse between India and the West, and we have the direct\r\n      testimony of Dio Chrysostom, circa 100, that there was intercourse\r\n      between Alexandria and India, and that Indians came to Alexandria to\r\n      study in the schools of that city. See DCB, art. “Pantænus.”\r\n\r\n   31 Probably the Gnostics.\r\n\r\n   32 He had given his property to his native place.\r\n\r\n   33 Fronto. See W.

Hær._, I, 215.\r\n\r\n   45 Generally spoken of as hylics.\r\n\r\n_   46 Cf._ introductory note to following selection.\r\n\r\n   47 The term used for a sending forth is προβολή or emanation, and is\r\n      constantly used in Gnosticism; hence the objection on the part of\r\n      the majority of Christian theologians to the use of the term in\r\n      describing the relations of the members of the Trinity.\r\n\r\n   48 This negative seems to spoil the sense of the passage, and is\r\n      omitted in some editions.\r\n\r\n   49 Simplicity is always regarded in ancient thought as a characteristic\r\n      of Deity.\r\n\r\n   50 According to another reading, of this one.\r\n\r\n   51 A city of Thrace on the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n   52 See this passage as quoted in Eusebius, _Hist. Ec._, V, 6, and\r\n      McGiffert’s notes.\r\n\r\n   53 By a slight change in the order of the words, as suggested by\r\n      Neander, the last two clauses might read more clearly: “To judge the\r\n      quick and also the dead through the resurrection of the flesh.”\r\n\r\n   54 Reference to the creation of the sun, moon, and stars on the fourth\r\n      day of creation.\r\n\r\n   55 Probably his wet-nurse was a Christian.\r\n\r\n   56 On the occasion of his triumphal entry into Rome.\r\n\r\n   57 From here text in Kirch, nn. 84 _ff._\r\n\r\n   58 Probably the reference is to the privilege of celebrating the\r\n      eucharist, and not merely the reception of the sacrament from the\r\n      hands of Anicetus.\r\n\r\n   59 Here, as elsewhere in Tertullian, the oblation, or sacrifice, or\r\n      offering, is the prayers of the faithful, and not the eucharist.\r\n\r\n   60 The word substance as used here in connection with the nature of the\r\n      Trinity has not taken its later meaning and use.\r\n\r\n_   61 I.e._, the followers of Praxeas, who are here introduced as\r\n      speaking.\r\n\r\n   62 Not οὐσία, but ὑποκειμένω.\r\n\r\n_   63 Sacerdotes_, and so throughout.\r\n\r\n   64 A person married a second time, _i.e._, after the death of his first\r\n      wife.\r\n\r\n_   65 Cf._ Acts 2:22.\r\n\r\n   66 Proverbs 4:8, 9.\r\n\r\n_   67 I.e._, having rule over all, not merely able to do all, and so\r\n      throughout.\r\n\r\n   68 The Greek is preserved here and throws light on the reasoning. The\r\n      Latin _omnipotens_ stands for παντοκράτωρ.\r\n\r\n_   69 I.e._, it is not certain rites nor certain beliefs that give merit\r\n      to our worship.\r\n\r\n   70 The term _papa_ is applied to Cyprian several times in the extant\r\n      epistles addressed to him.\r\n\r\n_   71 I.e._, Rome. There was a vacancy at that time, A. D. 250. in the\r\n      episcopate of Rome and the clergy administered the affairs of that\r\n      church _sede vacante_.\r\n\r\n_   72 I.e._, the pure ones.\r\n\r\n   73 In the next chapter of Eusebius (= VII, 25) there are the critical\r\n      reasons against the apostolic authorship of the Revelation of St.\r\n      John, based upon a critical comparison with the Fourth Gospel and\r\n      the Epistles of St. John, reasons which are still current in radical\r\n      critical circles.\r\n\r\n   74 The bracketed phrases are doubtful.\r\n\r\n   75 Gregory uses the term Trias for Trinity here and throughout.\r\n\r\n   76 On the whole passage, _cf._ I Cor. 15:42 _ff._\r\n\r\n_   77 Sanguis Christi incipit esse sine nobis._ Paschasius Radbertus\r\n      quotes this. _De corpore et sanguine Domini_, ch.

On this whole matter of the\r\n      sacraments in the Fathers, see Schwanne, _Dogmengeschichte_, § 93,\r\n      which is very clear and helpful, especially as showing the basis of\r\n      scholastic theory of the sacraments in the patristic period, and\r\n      that, too, without doing violence to his authorities.\r\n\r\n  174 The basis of the doctrine of the indelible character of baptism.\r\n      _Cf._ Augustine, _Contra epist.

II. vol. XIV; To Nestorius, p. 197; To the Easterns,\r\n      _i.e._, to John of Antioch (Cyril, _Ep._ 39), p. 251.\r\n\r\n  190 See above, the _Tome_ of Leo.\r\n\r\n  191 It was charged against Eutyches that he taught that the Son brought\r\n      His body with Him from heaven. This Eutyches denied.\r\n\r\n  192 This is the position of Eutyches. Cyril of Alexandria also taught\r\n      the same; _cf._ Loofs, _Leitfaden zum Studium der Dogmengeschichte_,\r\n      1906, § 37, 2.\r\n\r\n  193 Cyril’s phrase was “The one nature of the incarnate Logos”; _cf._\r\n      Ottley, _The Doctrine of the Incarnation_, 1896, II, 93.\r\n\r\n  194 The text of this passage, the most important dogmatically, may be\r\n      found in all the references given above.\r\n\r\n  195 Against Eutyches, who denied this point, and also against\r\n      Apollinaris, _v. supra_, § 88, _a_.\r\n\r\n  196 The Nestorians were accused of dividing the person of Christ into\r\n      two Sons.\r\n\r\n  197 The present Greek text reads “of two natures,” but “in two natures”\r\n      was the original reading.

For so long as\r\n      this constitution be perpetually observed in the Church of God, the\r\n      entire belief of the faithful will be confirmed, and the false faith\r\n      of the infidels be confuted, in order that one may be very easily\r\n      inclined to believe what one hears very often repeated, neither\r\n      shall any one excuse himself from all blame by pleading ignorance of\r\n      the faith, when he knows from the mouth of all what the Catholic\r\n      Church holds and believes.” (From the Speech of Reccared, _cf._\r\n      Mansi, _loc. cit._)\r\n\r\n  223 Here, as very often, the bishops attending a council are spoken of\r\n      as priests. The term “priest” had not become identified with\r\n      “presbyter.” The bishop was a _sacerdos_ or priest. The presbyter\r\n      was also a _sacerdos_.\r\n\r\n  224 This testimonial, or certificate of election, was to be presented to\r\n      the king that he might give his assent; _cf._ § 94.\r\n\r\n  225 The kings appear to have attempted to appoint bishops without\r\n      canonical election.

In the eighth, ninth, and tenth\r\n      sessions of the Council of Chalcedon, the cases of Theodoret and\r\n      Ibas were examined, they were heard in their own defence and were\r\n      acquitted or excused without censure.

The\r\n      case of Theodore of Mopsuestia, however, did not come before the\r\n      Council of Chalcedon, because he was dead. _v. supra_, § 93, the\r\n      _Constitutum_ of Vigilius.\r\n\r\n_  251 I.e._, in communion with the Roman see.\r\n\r\n  252 Boniface III, 606-607.\r\n\r\n  253 Boniface IV, 607-615.\r\n\r\n  254 He was not a professed Catholic.

It is not improbable that the genuine relics of St.\r\n      Augustine are here.\r\n\r\n  288 Note that this is not “the one nature of the Word of God become\r\n      flesh,” the formula most commonly employed by Cyril, and to be\r\n      distinguished from this, though Cyril sometimes appears to use the\r\n      two contrary to his own distinction.\r\n\r\n  289 The phrase of Dionysius was not “one theandric energy” but “a new\r\n      theandric energy.”\r\n\r\n_  290 I.e._, the incarnation, term so used constantly in Greek theology.\r\n\r\n  291 The _Ecthesis_.\r\n\r\n  292 From here text in Denziger.\r\n\r\n  293 Latin reads: _our Lord Jesus Christ_.\r\n\r\n  294 For this council, see Hefele, § 314.\r\n\r\n  295 From here the text may be found also in Hahn, § 150.\r\n\r\n_  296 Prosopon_, and so throughout.\r\n\r\n_  297 Hypostasis_, and so throughout.\r\n\r\n  298 Latin: _God the Word_.\r\n\r\n  299 The preceding is but a recapitulation of Chalcedon; see above, § 90.\r\n\r\n_  300 I.e._, Gregory Nazianzus.\r\n\r\n  301 Leo, _Ep. ad Flavianum_, ch. 4: Agit enim utraque forma cum alterius\r\n      communione quod proprium est, Verbo scilicet operante quod Verbi\r\n      est, et carne exsequente quod carnis est; unum horum coruscat\r\n      miraculis, aliud succumbit iniuriis; _v. supra_, § 90, _b_.\r\n\r\n  302 Greek: _economic life_.\r\n\r\n  303 Latin adds: _indivisibly and unconfusedly_.\r\n\r\n  304 Here, as elsewhere, “natural will” means such a will as belongs to a\r\n      nature, divine or human.\r\n\r\n  305 The Emperor to whom the report is made.\r\n\r\n  306 The most important parts of this are to be found in Hahn, § 235.\r\n\r\n  307 Decretal letters.\r\n\r\n_  308 I.e._, Gregory Nazianzus.\r\n\r\n  309 Probably that of 256.\r\n\r\n_  310 I.e._, Saturdays.\r\n\r\n  311 See canon 69 of the Apostolic Canons, which prescribed fasting on\r\n      the Saturday before Easter, or the Preparation.\r\n\r\n  312 John the Baptist.\r\n\r\n_  313 The Edict_ says seventy-sixth year.\r\n\r\n  314 In the duchy of Spoleto.\r\n\r\n_  315 I.e._, a picture, and not a statue, for these had been forbidden\r\n      long since.\r\n\r\n  316 Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Sinigaglia, and Ancona.\r\n\r\n_  317 Duces_ can hardly mean dukes here.\r\n\r\n  318 Governor of Naples under the Emperor.\r\n\r\n  319 These names are not all to be identified. Auximanum, however, is\r\n      Osimo, south of Ancona; Ferronianus is Fregnano, near Modena;\r\n      Montebelli or Monte Veglio is west of Bologna; Persiceta is also\r\n      near Bologna, which Paulus Diaconus says was taken by the Lombards,\r\n      _op. cit._, VI, 49.\r\n\r\n  320 From Sept. 1, A. D. 727, to Sept. 1, A. D. 728.\r\n\r\n  321 One hundred and forty, according to another reading.\r\n\r\n  322 Aurifer, or, according to another reading, Lucifer.\r\n\r\n  323 Both duchies were nominally under the king of the Lombards, but it\r\n      is very probable that they were attempting to free themselves from\r\n      his rule.\r\n\r\n  324 The Campus Neronis was outside the walls of Rome, as they then\r\n      extended and adjoined the Vatican.\r\n\r\n  325 Barberino, fifteen miles east of Civita Vecchia.\r\n\r\n  326 This was his real name.\r\n\r\n  327 See introduction to this extract.\r\n\r\n  328 See next selection.\r\n\r\n_  329 I.e._, in pictures.\r\n\r\n  330 John had a strong argument here as the Iconoclasts reverenced the\r\n      true cross.\r\n\r\n  331 θεομήτως, not θεοτόκος.\r\n\r\n_  332 Cf._ Basil, _De Spiritu_, ch. 27; _v. supra_, § 87, for Basil on\r\n      the force of tradition.\r\n\r\n  333 The creed of Nicæa is not here recited, only the so-called creed of\r\n      Constantinople, but without the _filioque_ in the Greek.\r\n\r\n  334 Pneumatomachians.\r\n\r\n_  335 I.e._, monks.",
