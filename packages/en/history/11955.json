(1589-1593.)\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of August, 1589, in the morning, upon his arrival in his\r\nquarters at Meudon, Henry of Navarre was saluted by the Protestants King\r\nof France.  They were about five thousand in an army of forty thousand\r\nmen.  When, at ten o’clock, he entered the camp of the Catholics at St.\r\nCloud, three of their principal leaders, Marshal d’Aumont, and Sires\r\nd’Humieres and de Givry, immediately acknowledged him unconditionally, as\r\nthey had done the day before at the death-bed of Henry III., and they at\r\nonce set to work to conciliate to him the noblesse of Champagne, Picardy,\r\nand Ile-de-France.  “Sir,” said Givry, “you are the king of the brave;\r\nyou will be deserted by none but dastards.”  But the majority of the\r\nCatholic leaders received him with such expressions as, “Better die than\r\nendure a Huguenot king!”  One of them, Francis d’O, formally declared to\r\nhim that the time had come for him to choose between the insignificance\r\nof a King of Navarre and the grandeur of a King of France; if he\r\npretended to the crown, he must first of all abjure.  Henry firmly\r\nrejected these threatening entreaties, and left their camp with an urgent\r\nrecommendation, to them to think of it well before bringing dissension\r\ninto the royal army and the royal party which were protecting their\r\nprivileges, their property, and their lives against the League.  On\r\nreturning to his quarters, he noticed the arrival of Marshal de Biron,\r\nwho pressed him to lay hands without delay upon the crown of France, in\r\norder to guard it and save it.  But, in the evening of that day and on\r\nthe morrow, at the numerous meetings of the lords to deliberate upon the\r\nsituation, the ardent Catholics renewed their demand for the exclusion of\r\nHenry from the throne if he did not at once abjure, and for referring the\r\nelection of a king to the states-general.  Biron himself proposed not to\r\ndeclare Henry king, but to recognize him merely as captain-general of the\r\narmy pending his abjuration.  Harlay de Sancy vigorously maintained the\r\ncause of the Salic law and the hereditary rights of monarchy.  Biron took\r\nhim aside and said, I had hitherto thought that you had sense; now I\r\ndoubt it.  If, before securing our own position with the King of Navarre,\r\nwe completely establish his, he will no longer care for us.  The time is\r\ncome for making our terms; if we let the occasion escape us, we shall\r\nnever recover it.”  “What are your terms?” asked Sancy.  “If it please\r\nthe king to give me the countship of Perigord, I shall be his forever.”\r\n Sancy reported this conversation to the king, who promised Biron what he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nThough King of France for but two days past, Henry IV. had already\r\nperfectly understood and steadily taken the measure of the situation.  He\r\nwas in a great minority throughout the country as well as the army, and\r\nhe would have to deal with public passions, worked by his foes for their\r\nown ends, and with the personal pretensions of his partisans.  He made no\r\nmistake about these two facts, and he allowed them great weight; but he\r\ndid not take for the ruling principle of his policy and for his first\r\nrule of conduct the plan of alternate concessions to the different\r\nparties and of continually humoring personal interests; he set his\r\nthoughts higher, upon the general and natural interests of France as he\r\nfound her and saw her.  They resolved themselves, in his eyes, into the\r\nfollowing great points: maintenance of the hereditary rights of monarchy,\r\npreponderance of Catholics in the government, peace between Catholics and\r\nProtestants, and religious liberty for Protestants.  With him these\r\npoints became the law of his policy and his kingly duty, as well as the\r\nnation’s right.  He proclaimed them in the first words that he addressed\r\nto the lords and principal personages of state assembled around him.\r\n“You all know,” said he, “what orders the late king my predecessor gave\r\nme, and what he enjoined upon me with his dying breath.  It was chiefly\r\nto maintain my subjects, Catholic or Protestant, in equal freedom, until\r\na council, canonical, general, or national, had decided this great\r\ndispute.  I promised him to perform faithfully that which he bade me, and\r\nI regard it as one of my first duties to be as good as my word.  I have\r\nheard that some who are in my army feel scruples about remaining in my\r\nservice unless I embrace the Catholic religon.  No doubt they think me\r\nweak enough for them to imagine that they can force me thereby to abjure\r\nmy religion and break my word.  I am very glad to inform them here, in\r\npresence of you all, that I would rather this were the last day of my\r\nlife than take any step which might cause me to be suspected of having\r\ndreamt of renouncing the religion that I sucked in with my mother’s milk,\r\nbefore I have been better instructed by a lawful council, to whose\r\nauthority I bow in advance.  Let him who thinks so ill of me get him gone\r\nas soon as he pleases; I lay more store by a hundred good Frenchmen than\r\nby two hundred who could harbor sentiments so unworthy.  Besides, though\r\nyou should abandon me, I should have enough of friends left to enable me,\r\nwithout you and to your shame, with the sole assistance of their strong\r\narms, to maintain the rights of my authority.  But were I doomed to see\r\nmyself deprived of even that assistance, still the God who has preserved\r\nme from my infancy, as if by His own hand, to sit upon the throne, will\r\nnot abandon me.  I nothing doubt that He will uphold me where He has\r\nplaced me, not for love of me, but for the salvation of so many souls who\r\npray, without ceasing, for His aid, and for whose freedom He has deigned\r\nto make use of my arm.  You know that I am a Frenchman and the foe of all\r\nduplicity.  For the seventeen years that I have been King of Navarre, I\r\ndo not think that I have ever departed from my word.  I beg you to\r\naddress your prayers to the Lord on my behalf, that He may enlighten me\r\nin my views, direct my purposes, bless my endeavors.  And in case I\r\ncommit any fault or fail in any one of my duties,--for I acknowledge that\r\nI am a man like any other,--pray Him to give me grace that I may correct\r\nit, and to assist me in all my goings.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry IV.----11]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of August, 1589, an official manifesto of Henry IV.’s\r\nconfirmed the ideas and words of this address.  On the same day, in the\r\ncamp at St. Cloud, the majority of the princes, dukes, lords, and\r\ngentlemen present in the camp expressed their full adhesion to the\r\naccession and the manifesto of the king, promising him “service and\r\nobedience against rebels and enemies who would usurp the kingdom.”  Two\r\nnotable leaders, the Duke of Epernon amongst the Catholics, and the Duke\r\nof La Tremoille amongst the Protestants, refused to join in this\r\nadhesion; the former saying that his conscience would not permit him to\r\nserve a heretic king, the latter alleging that his conscience forbade him\r\nto serve a prince who engaged to protect Catholic idolatry.  They\r\nwithdrew, D’Epernon into Angoumois and Saintonge, taking with him six\r\nthousand foot and twelve thousand horse; and La Tremoille into Poitou,\r\nwith nine battalions of Reformers.  They had an idea of attempting, both\r\nof them, to set up for themselves independent principalities.  Three\r\ncontemporaries, Sully, La Force, and the bastard of Angouleme, bear\r\nwitness that Henry IV. was deserted by as many Huguenots as Catholics.\r\nThe French royal army was reduced, it is said, to one half.  As a\r\nmake-weight, Saucy prevailed upon the Swiss, to the number of twelve\r\nthousand, and two thousand German auxiliaries, not only to continue in\r\nthe service of the new king, but to wait six months for their pay, as he\r\nwas at the moment unable to pay them.  From the 14th to the 20th of\r\nAugust, in Ile-de-France, in Picardy, in Normandy, in Auvergne, in\r\nChampagne, in Burgundy, in Anjou, in Poitou, in Languedoc, in Orleanness,\r\nand in Touraine, a great number of towns and districts joined in the\r\ndetermination of the royal army.  The last instance of such adherence had\r\na special importance.  At the time of Henry III.’s rupture with the\r\nLeague, the Parliament of Paris had been split in two; the royalists had\r\nfollowed the king to Tours, the partisans of the League had remained at\r\nParis.  After the accession of Henry IV., the Parliament of Tours, with\r\nthe president, Achille de Harlay, as its head, increased from day to day,\r\nand soon reached two hundred members, whilst the Parliament of Paris, or\r\nBrisson Parliament, as it was called from its leader’s name, had only\r\nsixty-eight left.  Brisson, on undertaking the post, actually thought it\r\nright to take the precaution of protesting privately, making a\r\ndeclaration in the presence of notaries “that he so acted by constraint\r\nonly, and that he shrank from any rebellion against his king and\r\nsovereign lord.”  It was, indeed, on the ground of the heredity of the\r\nmonarchy and by virtue of his own proper rights that Henry IV. had\r\nascended the throne; and M. Poirson says quite correctly, in his learned\r\n_Histoire du Regne d’Henri IV._  [t. i.  p. 29, second edition, 1862],\r\n“The manifesto of Henry IV., as its very name indicates, was not a\r\ncontract settled between the noblesse in camp at St. Cloud and the\r\nclaimant; it was a solemn and reciprocal acknowledgment by the noblesse\r\nof Henry’s rights to the crown, and by Henry of the nation’s political,\r\ncivil, and religious rights.  The engagements entered into by Henry were\r\nonly what were necessary to complete the guarantees given for the\r\nsecurity of the rights of Catholics.  As touching the succession to the\r\nthrone, the signataries themselves say that all they do is to maintain\r\nand continue the law of the land.”\r\n\r\nThere was, in 1589, an unlawful pretender to the throne of France; and\r\nthat was Cardinal Charles de Bourbon, younger brother of Anthony de\r\nBourbon, King of Navarre, and consequently uncle of Henry IV., sole\r\nrepresentative of the elder branch.  Under Henry III., the cardinal had\r\nthrown in his lot with the League; and, after the murder of Guise, Henry\r\nIII. had, by way of precaution, ordered him to be arrested and detained\r\nhim in confinement at Chinon, where he still was when Henry III. was in\r\nhis turn murdered.  On becoming king, the far-sighted Henry IV. at once\r\nbethought him of his uncle and of what he might be able to do against\r\nhim.  The cardinal was at Chinon, in the custody of Sieur de Chavigny,\r\n“a man of proved fidelity,” says De Thou, “but by this time old and\r\nblind.”  Henry IV. wrote to Du Plessis-Mornay, appointed quite recently\r\ngovernor of Saumur, “bidding him, at any price,” says Madame de Mornay,\r\n“to get Cardinal de Bourbon away from Chinon, where he was, without\r\nsparing anything, even to the whole of his property, because he would\r\nincontinently set himself up for king if he could obtain his release.”\r\n Henry IV. was right.  As early as the 7th of August, the Duke of Mayenne\r\nhad an announcement made to the Parliament of Paris, and written notice\r\nsent to all the provincial governors, “that, in the interval until the\r\nstates-general could be assembled, he urged them all to unite with him in\r\nrendering with one accord to their Catholic king, that is to say,\r\nCardinal de Bourbon, the obedience that was due to him.”  The cardinal\r\nwas, in fact, proclaimed king under the name of Charles X.; and eight\r\nmonths afterwards, on the 5th of March, 1590, the Parliament of Paris\r\nissued a decree “recognizing Charles X. as true and lawful king of\r\nFrance.”  Du Plessis-Mornay, ill though he was, had understood and\r\nexecuted, without loss of time, the orders of King Henry, going bail\r\nhimself for the promises that had to be made and for the sums that had\r\nto be paid to get the cardinal away from the governor of Chinon.  He\r\nsucceeded, and had the cardinal removed to Fontenay-le-Comte in Poitou,\r\n“under the custody of Sieur de la Boulaye, governor of that place, whose\r\nvalor and fidelity were known to him.”  “That,” said Henry IV. on\r\nreceiving the news, “is one of the greatest services I could have had\r\nrendered me; M. du Plessis does business most thoroughly.”  On the 9th of\r\nMay, 1590, not three months after the decree of the Parliament of Paris\r\nwhich had proclaimed him true and lawful King of France, Cardinal de\r\nBourbon, still a prisoner, died at Fontenay, aged sixty-seven.  A few\r\nweeks before his death he had written to his nephew Henry IV. a letter in\r\nwhich he recognized him as his sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe League was more than ever dominant in Paris; Henry IV. could not\r\nthink of entering there.  Before recommencing the war in his own name, he\r\nmade Villeroi, who, after the death of Henry III., had rejoined the Duke\r\nof Mayenne, an offer of an interview in the Bois de Boulogne to see if\r\nthere were no means of treating for peace.  Mayenne would not allow\r\nVilleroi to accept the offer.  “He had no private quarrel,” he said,\r\n“with the King of Navarre, whom he highly honored, and who, to his\r\ncertain knowledge, had not looked with approval upon his brothers’ death;\r\nbut any appearance of negotiation would cause great distrust amongst\r\ntheir party, and they would not do anything that tended against the\r\nrights of King Charles X.”  Renouncing all idea of negotiation, Henry IV.\r\nset out on the 8th of August from St. Cloud, after having told off his\r\narmy in three divisions.  Two were ordered to go and occupy Picardy and\r\nChampagne; and the king kept with him only the third, about six thousand\r\nstrong.  He went and laid the body of Henry III. in the church of\r\nSt. Corneille at Compiegne, took Meulan and several small towns on the\r\nbanks of the Seine and Oise, and propounded for discussion with his\r\nofficers the question of deciding in which direction he should move,\r\ntowards the Loire or the Seine, on Tours or on Rouen.  He determined in\r\nfavor of Normandy; he must be master of the ports in that province in\r\norder to receive there the re-enforcements which had been promised him by\r\nQueen Elizabeth of England, and which she did send him in September,\r\n1589, forming a corps of from four to five thousand men, Scots and\r\nEnglish, “aboard of thirteen vessels laden with twenty-two thousand\r\npounds sterling in gold and seventy thousand pounds of gunpowder, three\r\nthousand cannon-balls, and corn, biscuits, wine, and beer, together with\r\nwoollens and even shoes.”  They arrived very opportunely for the close of\r\nthe campaign, but too late to share in Henry IV.’s first victory, that\r\nseries of fights around the castle of Arques which, in the words of an\r\neye-witness, the Duke of Angouleme, “was the first gate whereby Henry\r\nentered upon the road of his glory and good fortune.”\r\n\r\nAfter making a demonstration close to Rouen, Henry IV., learning that\r\nthe Duke of Mayenne was advancing in pursuit of him with an army of\r\ntwenty-five thousand foot and eight thousand horse, thought it imprudent\r\nto wait for him and run the risk of being jammed between forces so\r\nconsiderable and the hostile population of a large city; so he struck\r\nhis camp and took the road to Dieppe, in order to be near the coast and\r\nthe re-enforcements from Queen Elizabeth.  Some persons even suggested\r\nto him that in case of mishap he might go thence and take refuge in\r\nEngland; but at this prospect Biron answered, “There is no King of\r\nFrance out of France;” and Henry IV. was of Biron’s opinion.  At his\r\narrival before Dieppe, he found as governor there Aymar de Chastes, a\r\nman of wits and honor, a very moderate Catholic, and very strongly in\r\nfavor of the party of policists.  Under Henry III. he had expressly\r\nrefused to enter the League, saying to Villars, who pressed him to do\r\nso, “I am a Frenchman, and you yourself will find out that the Spaniard\r\nis the real head of the League.”  He had organized at Dieppe four\r\ncompanies of burgess-guards, consisting of Catholics and Protestants,\r\nand he assembled about him, to consider the affairs of the town, a small\r\ncouncil, in which Protestants had the majority.  As soon as he knew, on\r\nthe 26th of August, that the king was approaching Dieppe, he went with\r\nthe principal inhabitants to meet him, and presented to him the keys of\r\nthe place, saying, “I come to salute my lord and hand over to him the\r\ngovernment of this city.” “Ventre-saint-gris!” answered Henry IV., “I\r\nknow nobody more worthy of it than you are!”  The Dieppese overflowed\r\nwith felicitations.  “No fuss, my lads,” said Henry: “all I want is your\r\naffections, good bread, good wine, and good hospitable faces.”  When he\r\nentered the town, “he was received,” says a contemporary chronicler,\r\n“with loud cheers by the people; and what was curious, but exhilarating,\r\nwas to see the king surrounded by close upon six thousand armed men,\r\nhimself having but a few officers at his left hand.”  He received at\r\nDieppe assurance of the fidelity of La Verune, governor of Caen,\r\nwhither, in 1589, according to Henry III.’s order, that portion of the\r\nParliament of Normandy which would not submit to the yoke of the League\r\nat Rouen, had removed.  Caen having set the example, St. Lo, Coutances,\r\nand Carentan likewise sent deputies to Dieppe to recognize the authority\r\nof Henry IV.  But Henry had no idea of shutting himself up inside\r\nDieppe: after having carefully inspected the castle, citadel, harbor,\r\nfortifications, and outskirts of the town, he left there five hundred\r\nmen in garrison, supported by twelve or fifteen hundred well-armed\r\nburgesses, and went and established himself personally in the old castle\r\nof Arques, standing, since the eleventh century, upon a barren hill;\r\nbelow, in the burgh of Arques, he sent Biron into cantonments with his\r\nregiment of Swiss and the companies of French infantry; and he lost no\r\ntime in having large fosses dug ahead of the burgh, in front of all the\r\napproaches, enclosing within an extensive line of circumvallation both\r\nburgh and castle.  All the king’s soldiers and the peasants that could\r\nbe picked up in the environs worked night and day.  Whilst they were at\r\nwork, Henry wrote to Countess Corisande de Gramont, his favorite at that\r\ntime, “My dear heart, it is a wonder I am alive with such work as I\r\nhave.  God have pity upon me and show me mercy, blessing my labors, as\r\nHe does in spite of a many folks!  I am well, and my affairs are going\r\nwell.  I have taken Eu.  The enemy, who are double me just now, thought\r\nto catch me there; but I drew off towards Dieppe, and I await them in a\r\ncamp that I am fortifying.  Tomorrow will be the day when I shall see\r\nthem, and I hope, with God’s help, that if they attack me they will find\r\nthey have made a bad bargain.  The bearer of this goes by sea.  The wind\r\nand my duties make me conclude.  This 9th of September, in the trenches\r\nat Arques.”\r\n\r\nAll was finished when the scouts of Mayenne appeared.  But Mayenne also\r\nwas an able soldier: he saw that the position the king had taken and the\r\nworks he had caused to be thrown up rendered a direct attack very\r\ndifficult.  He found means of bearing down upon Dieppe another way, and\r\nof placing himself, says the latest historian of Dieppe, M. Vitet,\r\nbetween the king and the town, “hoping to cut off the king’s\r\ncommunications with the sea, divide his forces, deprive him of his\r\nre-enforcements from England, and, finally, surround him and capture him,\r\nas he had promised the Leaguers of Paris, who were already talking of the\r\niron cage in which the Bearnese would be sent to them.  “Henry IV.,”\r\n continues M. Vitet, “felt some vexation at seeing his forecasts\r\ncheckmated by Mayenne’s manoeuvre, and at having had so much earth\r\nremoved to so little profit; but he was a man of resources, confident as\r\nthe Gascons are, and with very little of pig-headedness.  To change all\r\nhis plans was with him the work of an instant.  Instead of awaiting the\r\nfoe in his intrenchments, he saw that it was for him to go and feel for\r\nthem on the other side of the valley, and that, on pain of being\r\ninvested, he must not leave the Leaguers any exit but the very road they\r\nhad taken to come.”  Having changed all his plans on this new system,\r\nHenry breathed more freely; but he did not go to sleep for all that: he\r\nwas incessantly backwards and forwards from Dieppe to Arques, from Arques\r\nto Dieppe and to the Faubourg du Pollet.  Mayenne, on the contrary,\r\nseemed to have fallen into a lethargy; he had not yet been out of his\r\nquarters during the nearly eight and forty hours since he had taken them.\r\nOn the 17th of September, 1589, in the morning, however, a few hundred\r\nlight-horse were seen putting themselves in motion, scouring the country\r\nand coming to fire their pistols close to the fosses of the royal army.\r\nThe skirmish grew warm by degrees.  “My son,” said Marshal de Biron to\r\nthe young count of Auvergne [natural son of Charles IX. and Mary\r\nTouchet], “charge: now is the time.”  The young prince, without his hat,\r\nand his horsemen charged so vigorously that they put the Leaguers to the\r\nrout, killed three hundred of them, and returned quietly within their\r\nlines, by Biron’s orders, without being disturbed in their retreat.\r\nThese partial and irregular encounters began again on the 18th and 19th\r\nof September, with the same result.  The Duke of Mayenne was nettled and\r\nhumiliated; he had his prestige to recover.  He decided to concentrate\r\nall his forces right on the king’s intrenchments, and attack them in\r\nfront with his whole army.  The 20th of September passed without a single\r\nskirmish.  Henry, having received good information that he would be\r\nattacked the next day, did not go to bed.  The night was very dark.  He\r\nthought he saw a long way off in the valley a long line of lighted\r\nmatches; but there was profound silence; and the king and his officers\r\npuzzled themselves to decide if they were men or glow-worms.  On the\r\n21st, at five A. M., the king gave orders for every one to be ready and\r\nat his post.  He himself repaired to the battle-field.  Sitting in a big\r\nfosse with all his officers, he had his breakfast brought thither, and\r\nwas eating with good appetite, when a prisoner was brought to him, a\r\ngentleman of the League, who had advanced too far whilst making a\r\nreconnaissance.  “Good day, Belin,” said the king, who recognized him,\r\nlaughing: “embrace me for your welcome appearance.”  Belin embraced him,\r\ntelling him that he was about to have down upon him thirty thousand foot\r\nand ten thousand horse.  “Where are your forces?” he asked the king,\r\nlooking about him.  “O! you don’t see them all, M. de Belin,” said Henry:\r\n“you don’t reckon the good God and the good right, but they are ever with\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThe action began about ten o’clock.  The fog was still so thick that\r\nthere was no seeing one another at ten paces.  The ardor on both sides\r\nwas extreme; and, during nearly three hours, victory seemed to twice\r\nshift her colors.  Henry at one time found himself entangled amongst some\r\nsquadrons so disorganized that he shouted, “Courage, gentlemen; pray,\r\ncourage!  Can’t we find fifty gentlemen willing to die with their king?”\r\n At this moment Chatillon, issuing from Dieppe with five hundred picked\r\nmen, arrived on the field of battle.  The king dismounted to fight at his\r\nside in the trenches; and then, for a quarter of an hour, there was a\r\nfurious combat, man to man.  At last, “when things were in this desperate\r\nstate,” says Sully, “the fog, which had been very thick all the morning,\r\ndropped down suddenly, and the cannon of the castle of Arques getting\r\nsight of the enemy’s army, a volley of four pieces was fired, which made\r\nfour beautiful lanes in their squadrons and battalions.  That pulled them\r\nup quite short; and three or four volleys in succession, which produced\r\nmarvellous effects, made them waver, and, little by little, retire all of\r\nthem behind the turn of the valley, out of cannon-shot, and finally to\r\ntheir quarters.”  Mayenne had the retreat sounded.  Henry, master of the\r\nfield, gave chase for a while to the fugitives, and then returned to\r\nArques to thank God for his victory.  Mayenne struck his camp and took\r\nthe road towards Amiens, to pick up a Spanish corps which he was\r\nexpecting from the Low Countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sully----37]\r\n\r\nFor six months, from September, 1589, to March, 1590, the war continued\r\nwithout any striking or important events.  Henry IV. tried to stop it\r\nafter his success at Arques; he sent word to the Duke of Mayenne by his\r\nprisoner Belin, whom he had sent away free on parole, “that he desired\r\npeace, and so earnestly, that, without regarding his dignity or his\r\nvictory, he made him these advances, not that he had any fear of him, but\r\nbecause of the pity he felt for his kingdom’s sufferings.”  Mayenne, who\r\nlay beneath the double yoke of his party’s passions and his own ambitious\r\nprojects, rejected the king’s overtures, or allowed them to fall through;\r\nand on the 21st of October, 1589, Henry, setting out with his army from\r\nDieppe, moved rapidly on Paris, in order to effect a strategic surprise,\r\nwhilst Mayenne was rejecting at Amiens his pacific inclinations.  The\r\nking gained three marches on the Leaguers, and carried by assault the\r\nfive faubourgs situated on the left bank of the Seine.  He would perhaps\r\nhave carried terror-stricken Paris itself, if the imperfect breaking up\r\nof the St. Maixent bridge on the Somme had not allowed Mayenne,\r\nnotwithstanding his tardiness, to arrive at Paris in time to enter with\r\nhis army, form a junction with the Leaguers amongst the population, and\r\nprevail upon the king to carry his arms elsewhither.”  The people of\r\nParis,” says De Thou, “were extravagant enough to suppose that this\r\nprince could not escape Mayenne.  Already a host of idle and credulous\r\nwomen had been at the pains of engaging windows, which they let very\r\ndear, and which they had fitted up magnificently, to see the passage of\r\nthat fanciful triumph for which their mad hopes had caused them to make\r\nevery preparation--before the victory.”  Henry left some of his\r\nlieutenants to carry on the war in the environs of Paris, and himself\r\nrepaired, on the 21st of November, to Tours, where the royalist\r\nParliament, the exchequer-chamber, the court of taxation, and all the\r\nmagisterial bodies which had not felt inclined to submit to the despotism\r\nof the League, lost no time in rendering him homage, as the head and the\r\nrepresentative of the national and the lawful cause.  He reigned and\r\nruled, to real purpose, in the eight principal provinces of the North and\r\nCentre--Ile-de-France, Picardy, Champagne, Normandy, Orleanness,\r\nTouraine, Maine, and Anjou; and his authority, although disputed, was\r\nmaking way in nearly all the other parts of the kingdom.  He made war not\r\nlike a conqueror, but like a king who wanted to meet with acceptance in\r\nthe places which he occupied and which he would soon have to govern.  The\r\ninhabitants of Le Mans and of Alencon were able to reopen their shops on\r\nthe very day on which their town fell into his hands, and those of\r\nVendome the day after.  He watched to see that respect was paid by his\r\nsoldiers, even the Huguenots, to Catholic churches and ceremonies.  Two\r\nsoldiers, having made their way into Le Mans, contrary to orders, after\r\nthe capitulation, and having stolen a chalice, were hanged on the spot,\r\nthough they were men of acknowledged bravery. He protected carefully the\r\nbishops and all the ecclesiastics who kept aloof from political strife.\r\n“If minute details are required,” says a contemporary pamphleteer, “out\r\nof a hundred or a hundred and twenty archbishops or bishops existing in\r\nthe realm of France not a tenth part approve of the counsels of the\r\nLeague.”  It was not long before Henry reaped the financial fruits of his\r\nprotective equity; at the close of 1589 he could count upon a regular\r\nrevenue of more than two millions of crowns, very insufficient, no doubt,\r\nfor the wants of his government, but much beyond the official resources\r\nof his enemies.  He had very soon taken his proper rank in Europe: the\r\nProtestant powers which had been eager to recognize him--England,\r\nScotland, the Low Countries, the Scandinavian states, and Reformed\r\nGermany--had been joined by the republic of Venice, the most judiciously\r\ngoverned state at that time in Europe, but solely on the ground of\r\npolitical interests and views, independently of any religious question.\r\nOn the accession of Henry IV., his ambassador, Hurault de Maisse, was\r\nreceived and very well treated at Venice; he was merely excluded from\r\nreligious ceremonies: the Venetian people joined in the policy of their\r\ngovernment; the portrait of the new King of France was everywhere\r\ndisplayed and purchased throughout Venice.  Some Venetians went so far as\r\nto take service in his army against the League.  The Holy Inquisition\r\ncommenced proceedings against them for heresy; the government stopped the\r\nproceedings, and even, says Count Daru, had the Inquisitor thrown into\r\nprison.  The Venetian senate accredited to the court of Henry IV. the\r\nsame ambassador who had been at Henry III.’s; and, on returning to Tours,\r\non the 21st of November, 1589, the king received him to an audience in\r\nstate.  A little later on he did more; he sent the republic, as a pledge\r\nof his friendship, his sword--the sword, he said in his letter, which he\r\nhad used at the battle of Ivry.  “The good offices were mutual,” adds M.\r\nde Daru; the Venetians lent Henry IV. sums of money which the badness of\r\nthe times rendered necessary to him; but their ambassador had orders to\r\nthrow into the fire, in the king’s presence, the securities for the\r\nloan.”\r\n\r\nAs the government of Henry IV. went on growing in strength and extent,\r\ntwo facts, both of them natural, though antagonistic, were being\r\naccomplished in France and in Europe.  The moderate Catholics were\r\nbeginning, not as yet to make approaches towards him, but to see a\r\nglimmering possibility of treating with him and obtaining from him such\r\nconcessions as they considered necessary at the same time that they in\r\ntheir turn made to him such as he might consider sufficient for his party\r\nand himself.  It has already been remarked with what sagacity Pope Sixtus\r\nV. had divined the character of Henry IV., at the very moment of\r\ncondemning Henry III. for making an alliance with him.  When Henry IV.\r\nhad become king, Sixtus V. pronounced strongly against a heretic king,\r\nand maintained, in opposition to him, his alliance with Philip II. and\r\nthe League.  “France,” said he, “is a good and noble kingdom, which has\r\ninfinity of benefices and is specially dear to us; and so we try to save\r\nher; but religion sits nearer than France to our heart.”  He chose for\r\nhis legate in France Cardinal Gaetani, whom he knew to be agreeable to\r\nPhilip II. and gave him instructions in harmony with the Spanish policy.\r\nHaving started for his post, Gaetani was a long while on the road,\r\nhalting at Lyons, amongst other places, as if he were in no hurry to\r\nenter upon his duties.  At the close of 1589, Henry IV., king for the\r\nlast five months and already victorious at Arques, appointed as his\r\nambassador at Rome Francis de Luxembourg, Duke of Pinei, to try and enter\r\ninto official relations with the pope.  On the 6th of January, 1590,\r\nSixtus V., at his reception of the cardinals, announced to them this\r\nnews.  Badoero, ambassador of Venice at Rome, leaned forward and\r\nwhispered in his ear, “We must pray God to inspire the King of Navarre.\r\nOn the day when your Holiness embraces him, and then only, the affairs of\r\nFrance will be adjusted.  Humanly speaking, there is no other way of\r\nbringing peace to that kingdom.”  The pope confined himself to replying\r\nthat God would do all for the best, and that, for his own part, he would\r\nwait.  On arriving at Rome, “the Duke of Luxembourg repaired to the\r\nVatican with two and twenty carriages occupied by French gentlemen; but,\r\nat the palace, he found the door of the pope’s apartments closed, the\r\nsentries doubled, and the officers on duty under orders to intimate to\r\nthe French, the chief of the embassy excepted, that they must lay aside\r\ntheir swords.  At the door of the Holy Father’s closet, the duke and\r\nthree gentlemen of his train were alone allowed to enter.  The\r\nindignation felt by the French was mingled with apprehensions of an\r\nambush.  Luxembourg himself could not banish a feeling of vague terror;\r\ngreat was his astonishment when, on his introduction to the pontiff, the\r\nlatter received him with demonstrations of affection, asked him news of\r\nhis journey, said he would have liked to give him quarters in the palace,\r\nmade him sit down,--a distinction reserved for the ambassadors of kings,\r\n--and, lastly, listened patiently to the French envoy’s long recital.  In\r\nfact, the receptions _intra et, extra muros_ bore very little resemblance\r\none to the other, but the difference between them corresponded pretty\r\nfaithfully with the position of Sixtus V., half engaged to the League by\r\nGaetani’s commission and to Philip II. by the steps he had recently\r\ntaken, and already regretting that he was so far gone in the direction of\r\nSpain.”  [_Sixtus V,_ by Baron Hiibner, late ambassador of Austria at\r\nParis and at Rome, t. ii.  pp. 280-282.]\r\n\r\nUnhappily Sixtus V. died on the 27th of August, 1590, before having\r\nmodified, to any real purpose, his bearing towards the King of France and\r\nhis instructions to his legate.  After Pope Urban VIII.’s apparition of\r\nthirteen days’ duration, Gregory XIV. was elected pope on the 5th of\r\nDecember, 1590; and, instead of a head of the church able enough and\r\ncourageous enough to comprehend and practise a policy European and\r\nItalian as well as Catholic in its scope, there was a pope humbly devoted\r\nto the Spanish policy, meekly subservient to Philip II.; that is, to the\r\ncause of religious persecution and of absolute power, without regard for\r\nanything else.  The relations of France with the Holy See at once felt\r\nthe effects of this; Cardinal Gaetani received from Rome all the\r\ninstructions that the most ardent Leaguers could desire; and he gave his\r\napproval to a resolution of the Sorbonne to the effect that Henry de\r\nBourbon, heretic and relapsed, was forever excluded from the crown,\r\nwhether he became a Catholic or not.  Henry IV., had convoked the\r\nstates-general at Tours for the month of March, and had summoned to that\r\ncity the archbishops and bishops to form a national council, and to\r\ndeliberate as to the means of restoring the king to the bosom of the\r\nCatholic church.  The legate prohibited this council, declaring,\r\nbeforehand, the excommunication and deposition of any bishops who should\r\nbe present at it.  The Leaguer Parliament of Paris forbade, on pain of\r\ndeath and confiscation, any connection, any correspondence, with Henry\r\nde Bourbon and his partisans.  A solemn procession of the League took\r\nplace at Paris, on the 14th of March, and a few days afterwards the\r\nunion was sworn afresh by all the municipal chiefs of the population.\r\nIn view of such passionate hostility, Henry IV., a stranger to any sort\r\nof illusion at the same time that he was always full of hope, saw that\r\nhis successes at Arques were insufficient for him, and that, if he were\r\nto occupy the throne in peace, he must win more victories.  He\r\nrecommenced the campaign by the siege of Dreux, one of the towns which\r\nit was most important for him to possess in order to put pressure on\r\nParis, and cause her to feel, even at a distance, the perils and evils\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 14th of March, 1590, was fought the battle of Ivry,\r\na village six leagues from Evreux, on the left bank of the Eure.\r\n“Starting from Dreux on the 12th of March” [Poirson, _Histoire du Regne\r\nd’Henri IV.,__ t. i.  p. 180], “the royal army had arrived the same day\r\nat Nonancourt, marching with the greatest regularity by divisions and\r\nalways in close order, through fearful weather, frost having succeeding\r\nrain; moreover, it traversed a portion of the road during the shades of\r\nevening.  The soldier was harassed and knocked up.  But scarcely had he\r\narrived at his destination for the day, when he found large fires lighted\r\neverywhere, and provisions in abundance, served out with intelligent\r\nregularity to the various quarters of cavalry and infantry.  He soon\r\nrecovered all his strength and daring.”  The king, in concert with the\r\nveteran Marshal de Biron, had taken these prudent measures.  All the\r\nhistorians, contemporary and posterior, have described in great detail\r\nthe battle of Ivry, the manoeuvres and alternations of success that\r\ndistinguished it; by rare good fortune, we have an account of the affair\r\nwritten the very same evening in the camp at Rosny by Henry IV. himself,\r\nand at once sent off to some of his principal partisans who were absent,\r\namongst others to M. de la Verune, governor of Caen.  We will content\r\nourselves here with the king’s own words, striking in their precision,\r\nbrevity, and freedom from any self-complacent gasconading on the\r\nnarrator’s part, respecting either his party or himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry IV. at Ivry----26]\r\n\r\nLETTER OF KING HENRY IV. TOUCHING THE BATTLE OF IVRY.\r\n\r\n“It hath pleased God to grant me that which I had the most desired, to\r\nhave means of giving battle to mine enemies; having firm confidence that,\r\nhaving got so far, God would give me grace to obtain the victory, as it\r\nhath happened this very day.  You have heretofore heard how that, after\r\nthe capture of the town of Honfleur, I went and made them raise the siege\r\nthey were laying to the town of Meulan, and I offered them battle, which\r\nit seemed that they ought to accept, having in numbers twice the strength\r\nthat I could muster.  But in the hope of being able to do so with more\r\nsafety, they made up their minds to put it off until they had been joined\r\nby fifteen hundred lances which the Duke of Parma was sending them; which\r\nwas done a few days ago.  And then they spread abroad everywhere that\r\nthey would force me to fight, wheresoever I might be; they thought to\r\nhave found a very favorable opportunity in coming to encounter me at the\r\nsiege I was laying before the town of Dreux; but I did not give them the\r\ntrouble of coming so far; for, as soon as I was advertised that they had\r\ncrossed the river of Seine and were heading towards me, I resolved to put\r\noff the siege rather than fail to go and meet them.  Having learned that\r\nthey were six leagues from the said Dreux, I set out last Monday, the\r\n12th of this month, and went and took up my quarters at the town of\r\nNonancourt, which was three leagues from them, for to cross the river\r\nthere.  On Tuesday, I went and took the quarters which they meant to have\r\nfor themselves, and where their quarter-masters had already arrived.\r\nI put myself in order of battle, in the morning, on a very fine plain,\r\nabout a league from the point which they had chosen the day before, and\r\nwhere they immediately appeared with their whole army, but so far from me\r\nthat I should have given them a great advantage by going so forward to\r\nseek them; I contented myself with making them quit a village they had\r\nseized close by me; at last, night constrained us both to get into\r\nquarters, which I did in the nearest villages.\r\n\r\n“To-day, having had their position reconnoitred betimes, and after it had\r\nbeen reported to me that they had shown themselves, but even farther off\r\nthan they had done yesterday, I resolved to approach so near to them that\r\nthere must needs be a collision.  And so it happened between ten and\r\neleven in the morning; I went to seek them to the very spot where they\r\nwere posted, and whence they never advanced a step but what they\r\nmade to the charge; and the battle took place, wherein God was pleased to\r\nmake known that His protection is always on the side of the right; for in\r\nless than an hour, after having spent all their choler in two or three\r\ncharges which they made and supported, all their cavalry began to take\r\nits departure, leaving their infantry, which was in large numbers.\r\nSeeing which, their Swiss had recourse to my compassion, and surrendered,\r\ncolonels, captains, privates, and all their flags.  The lanzknechts and\r\nFrench had no time to take this resolution, for they were cut to pieces,\r\ntwelve hundred of one and as many of the other; the rest prisoners and\r\nput to the rout in the woods, at the mercy of the peasants.  Of their\r\ncavalry there are from nine hundred to a thousand killed, and from four\r\nto five hundred dismounted and prisoners; without counting those drowned\r\nin crossing the River Eure, which they crossed to Ivry for to put it\r\nbetween them and us, and who are a great number.  The rest of the better\r\nmounted saved themselves by flight, in very great disorder, having lost\r\nall their baggage.  I did not let them be until they were close to\r\nMantes.  Their white standard is in my hands, and its bearer a prisoner;\r\ntwelve or fifteen other standards of their cavalry, twice as many more of\r\ntheir infantry, all their artillery; countless lords prisoners, and of\r\ndead a great number, even of those in command, whom I have not yet been\r\nable to find time to get identified.  But I know that amongst others\r\nCount Egmont, who was general of all the forces that came from Flanders,\r\nwas killed.  Their prisoners all say that their army was about four\r\nthousand horse, and from twelve to thirteen thousand foot, of which I\r\nsuppose not a quarter has escaped.  As for mine, it may have been two\r\nthousand horse and eight thousand foot.  But of this cavalry, more than\r\nsix hundred horse joined me after I was in order of battle, on the\r\nTuesday and Wednesday; nay, the last troop of the noblesse from Picardy,\r\nbrought up by Sire d’Humieres, and numbering three hundred horse, came up\r\nwhen half an hour had already passed since the battle began.\r\n\r\n“It is a miraculous work of God’s, who was pleased, first of all, to give\r\nme the resolution to attack them, and then the grace to be able so\r\nsuccessfully to accomplish it.  Wherefore to Him alone is the glory; and\r\nso far as any of it may, by His permission, belong to man, it is due to\r\nthe princes, officers of the crown, lords, captains, and all the\r\nnoblesse, who with so much ardor rushed forward, and so successfully\r\nexerted themselves, that their predecessors did not leave them more\r\nbeautiful examples than they will leave to their posterity.  As I am\r\ngreatly content and satisfied with them, so I think that they are with\r\nme, and that they have seen that I had no mind to make use of them\r\nanywhere without I had also shown them the way.  I am still following up\r\nthe victory with my cousins the princes of Conti, Duke of Montpensier,\r\nCount of St. Paul, Marshal-duke of Aumont, grand prior of France, La\r\nTremoille, Sieurs de la Guiche and de Givry, and several other lords and\r\ncaptains.  My cousin Marshal de Biron remains with the main army awaiting\r\nmy tidings, which will go on, I hope, still prospering.  You shall hear\r\nmore fully in my next despatch, which shall follow this very closely, the\r\nparticulars of this victory, whereof I desired to give you these few\r\nwords of information, so as not to keep you longer out of the pleasure\r\nwhich I know that you will receive therefrom.  I pray you to impart it to\r\nall my other good servants yonder, and, especially, to have thanks given\r\ntherefor to God, whom I pray to have you in His holy keeping.\r\n\r\n“HENRY.\r\n“From the camp at Rosny, this 14th day of March, 1590.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rosny Castle----30]\r\n\r\nHistory is not bound to be so reserved and so modest as the king was\r\nabout himself.  It was not only as able captain and valiant soldier that\r\nHenry IV. distinguished himself at Ivry; there the man was as conspicuous\r\nfor the strength of his better feelings, as generous and as affectionate\r\nas the king was farsighted and bold.  When the word was given to march\r\nfrom Dreux, Count Schomberg, colonel of the German auxiliaries called\r\nreiters, had asked for the pay of his troops, letting it be understood\r\nthat they would not fight if their claims were not satisfied.  Henry had\r\nreplied harshly, “People don’t ask for money on the eve of a battle.”  At\r\nIvry, just as the battle was on the point of beginning, he went up to\r\nSchomberg.  “Colonel,” said he, “I hurt your feelings.  This may be the\r\nlast day of my life.  I can’t bear to take away the honor of a brave and\r\nhonest gentleman like you.  Pray forgive me and embrace me.”  “Sir,”\r\n answered Schomberg, “the other day your Majesty wounded me, to-day you\r\nkill me.”  He gave up the command of the reiters in order to fight in the\r\nking’s own squadron, and was killed in action.  As he passed along the\r\nfront of his own squadron, Henry halted; and, “Comrades,” said he, “if\r\nyou run my risks, I also run yours.  I will conquer or die with you.\r\nKeep your ranks well, I beg.  If the heat of battle disperse you for a\r\nwhile, rally as soon as you can under those three pear trees you see up\r\nyonder to my right; and if you lose your standards, do not lose sight of\r\nmy white plume; you will always find it in the path of honor, and, I\r\nhope, of victory too.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Do not lose Sight of my White Plume.”----30]\r\n\r\nHaving galloped along the whole line of his army, he halted again, threw\r\nhis horse’s reins over his arm, and clasped his hands, exclaiming, “O\r\nGod, Thou knowest my thoughts, and Thou dost see to the very bottom of my\r\nheart; if it be for my people’s good that I keep the crown, favor Thou my\r\ncause and uphold my arms.  But if Thy holy will have otherwise ordained,\r\nat least let me die, O God, in the midst of these brave soldiers who give\r\ntheir lives for me!”  When the battle was over and won, he heard that\r\nRosny had been severely wounded in it; and when he was removed to Rosny\r\nCastle, the king, going close up to his stretcher, said, “My friend, I am\r\nvery glad to see you with a much better countenance than I expected; I\r\nshould feel still greater joy if you assure me that you run no risk of\r\nyour life or of being disabled forever; the rumor was, that you had two\r\nhorses killed under you; that you had been borne to earth, rolled over\r\nand trampled upon by the horses of several squadrons, bruised and cut up\r\nby so many blows that it would be a marvel if you escaped, or if, at the\r\nvery least, you were not mutilated for life in some limb.  I should like\r\nto hug you with both arms.  I shall never have any good fortune or\r\nincrease of greatness but you shall share it.  Fearing that too much\r\ntalking may be harmful to your wounds, I am off again to Mantes.  Adieu,\r\nmy friend; fare you well, and be assured that you have a good master.”\r\n\r\nHenry IV. had not only a warm but an expansive heart; he could not help\r\nexpressing and pouring forth his feelings.  That was one of his charms,\r\nand also one of his sources of power.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Ivry had a great effect in France and in Europe.  But not\r\nimmediately and as regarded the actual campaign of 1590.  The victorious\r\nking moved on Paris, and made himself master of the little towns in the\r\nneighborhood with a view of investing the capital.  When he took\r\npossession of St. Denis [on the 9th of July, 1590], he had the relics and\r\nall the jewelry of the church shown to him.  When he saw the royal crown,\r\nfrom which the principal stones had been detached, he asked what had\r\nbecome of them.  He was told that M. de Mayehne had caused them to-be\r\nremoved.  “He has the stones, then,” said the king; “and I have the\r\nsoil.”  He visited the royal tombs, and when he was shown that of\r\nCatherine de’ Medici, “ Ah!” said he smiling, “how well it suits her!”\r\n And, as he stood before Henry III.’s he said, “Ventre-saint-gris!  There\r\nis my good brother; I desire that I be laid beside him.”  As he thus went\r\non visiting and establishing all his posts around Paris, the investment\r\nbecame more strict; it was kept up for more than three months, from the\r\nend of May to the beginning of September, 1590; and the city was reduced\r\nto a severe state of famine, which would have been still more severe if\r\nHenry IV. had not several times over permitted the entry of some convoys\r\nof provisions and the exit of the old men, the women, the children, in\r\nfact, the poorest and weakest part of the population.  “Paris must not be\r\na cemetery,” be said; “I do not wish to reign over the dead.”  “A true\r\nking,” says De Thou, “more anxious for the preservation of his kingdom\r\nthan greedy of conquest, and making no distinction between his own\r\ninterests and the interests of his people.”  Two famous Protestants,\r\nAmbrose Pare and Bernard Palissy, preserved, one by his surgical and the\r\nother by his artistic genius, from the popular fury, were still living at\r\nthat time in Paris, both eighty years of age, and both pleading for the\r\nliberty of their creed and for peace.  “Monseigneur,” said Ambrose Pare\r\none day to the Archbishop of Lyons, whom he met at one end of the bridge\r\nof St. Michael, “this poor people that you see here around you is dying\r\nof sheer hunger-madness, and demands your compassion.  For God’s sake\r\nshow them some, as you would have God’s shown to you.  Think a little on\r\nthe office to which God hath called you.  Give us peace or give us\r\nwherewithal to live, for the poor folks can hold out no more.”  The\r\nItalian Danigarola himself, Bishop of Asti and attache to the embassy of\r\nCardinal Gaetani, having publicly said that peace was necessary, was\r\nthreatened by the Sixteen with being sewn up in a sack and thrown into\r\nthe river if he did not alter his tone.  Not peace, but a cessation of\r\nthe investment of Paris, was brought about, on the 23d of August, 1590,\r\nby Duke Alexander of Parma, who, in accordance with express orders from\r\nPhilip II., went from the Low Countries, with his army, to join Mayenne\r\nat Meaux and threaten Henry IV. with their united forces if he did not\r\nretire from the walls of the capital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma----32]\r\n\r\nHenry IV. offered the two dukes battle, if they really wished to put a\r\nstop to the investment; but “I am not come so far,” answered the Duke of\r\nParma, “to take counsel of my enemy; if my manner of warfare does not\r\nplease the King of Navarre, let him force me to change it, instead of\r\ngiving me advice that nobody asks him for.”  Henry in vain attempted to\r\nmake the Duke of Parma accept battle.  The able Italian established\r\nhimself in a strongly intrenched camp, surprised Lagny, and opened to\r\nParis the navigation of the Marne, by which provisions were speedily\r\nbrought up.  Henry decided upon retreating; he dispersed the different\r\ndivisions of his army into Touraine, Normandy, Picardy, Champagne,\r\nBurgundy, and himself took up his quarters at Senlis, at Compiegne, in\r\nthe towns on the banks of the Oise.  The Duke of Mayenne arrived on the\r\n18th of September at Paris; the Duke of Parma entered it himself with a\r\nfew officers, and left it on the 13th of November with his army on his\r\nway back to the Low Countries, being a little harassed in his retreat by\r\nthe royal cavalry, but easy, for the moment, as to the fate of Paris and\r\nthe issue of the war, which continued during the first six months of the\r\nyear 1591, but languidly and disconnectedly, with successes and reverses\r\nsee-sawing between the two parties and without any important results.\r\n\r\nThen began to appear the consequences of the victory of Ivry and the\r\nprogress made by Henry IV., in spite of the check he received before\r\nParis and at some other points in the kingdom.  Not only did many\r\nmoderate Catholics make advances to him, struck with his sympathetic\r\nability and his valor, and hoping that he would end by becoming a\r\nCatholic, but patriotic wrath was kindling in France against Philip II.\r\nand the Spaniards, those fomenters of civil war in the mere interest of\r\nforeign ambition.  We quoted but lately the words used by the governor of\r\nDieppe, Aymar de Chastes, when he said to Villars, governor of Rouen, who\r\npressed him to enter the League, “You will yourself find out that the\r\nSpaniard is the real head of this League.”  On the 5th of August, 1590,\r\nduring the investment of Paris, a placard was pasted all over the city.\r\n“Poor Parisians,” it said, “I deplore your misery, and I feel even\r\ngreater pity towards you for being still such simpletons.  See you not\r\nthat this son of perdition of a Spanish ambassador [Bernard de Mendoza],\r\nwho had our good king murdered, is making game of you, cramming you so\r\nwith pap that he would fain have had you burst before now in order to lay\r\nhands on your goods and on France if he could?  He alone prevents peace\r\nand the repose of desolated France, as well as the reconciliation of the\r\nking and the princes in real amity.  Why are ye so tardy to cast him in a\r\nsack down stream, that he may return the sooner to Spain?”  On the 6th of\r\nAugust, there was found written with charcoal, on the gate of St.\r\nAnthony, the following eight lines:--\r\n\r\n               “Some folks, for Holy League bear more\r\n               Than the prodigal son in the Bible bore;\r\n               For he, together with his swine,\r\n               On bean, and root, and husk would dine;\r\n               Whilst they, unable to procure\r\n               Such dainty morsels, must endure\r\n               Between their skinny lips to pass\r\n               Offal and tripe of horse or ass.”\r\n\r\n“These,” said a Latin inscription on the awnings of the butchers’ shops,\r\n“are the rewards of those who expose their lives for Philip” [_Haec sunt\r\nmunera pro iis qui vitam pro Philippo proferunt: Memoires de L’Estoile,_\r\nt. ii.  pp. 73, 74].  In 1591 these public sentiments, reproduced and\r\ndilated upon in numerous pamphlets, imported dissension into the heart of\r\nthe League itself, which split up into two parties, the Spanish League\r\nand the French League.  The Committee of Sixteen labored incessantly for\r\nthe formation and triumph of the Spanish League; and its principal\r\nleaders wrote, on the 2d of September, 1591, a letter to Philip II.,\r\noffering him the crown of France, and pledging their allegiance to him as\r\nhis subjects.  “We can positively assure your Majesty,” they said, “that\r\nthe wishes of all Catholics are to see your Catholic Majesty holding the\r\nsceptre of this kingdom and reigning over us, even as we do throw\r\nourselves right willingly into your arms as into those of our father, or\r\nat any rate establishing one of your posterity upon the throne.”  These\r\nringleaders of the Spanish League had for their army the blindly\r\nfanatical and demagogic populace of Paris, and were, further, supported\r\nby four thousand Spanish troops whom Philip II. had succeeded in getting\r\nalmost surreptitiously into Paris.  They created a council of ten, the\r\nsixteenth century’s committee of public safety; they proscribed the\r\npolicists; they, on the 15th of November, had the president, Brisson, and\r\ntwo councillors of the Leaguer Parliament arrested, hanged them to a beam\r\nand dragged the corpses to the Place de Grove, where they strung them up\r\nto a gibbet with inscriptions setting forth that they were heretics,\r\ntraitors to the city and enemies of the Catholic princes.  Whilst the\r\nSpanish League was thus reigning at Paris, the Duke of Mayenne was at\r\nLaon, preparing to lead his army, consisting partly of Spaniards, to the\r\nrelief of Rouen, the siege of which Henry IV. was commencing.  Being\r\nsummoned to Paris by messengers who succeeded one another every hour, he\r\narrived there on the 28th of November, 1591, with two thousand French\r\ntroops; he armed the guard of Burgesses, seized and hanged, in a\r\nground-floor room of the Louvre, four of the chief leaders of the Sixteen,\r\nsuppressed their committee, re-established the Parliament in full\r\nauthority, and, finally, restored the security and preponderance of the\r\nFrench League, whilst taking the reins once more into his own hands.  But\r\nthe French League before long found itself, in its turn, placed in a\r\nsituation quite as embarrassing, if not so provocative of odium, as that\r\nin which the Spanish League had lately been; for it had become itself the\r\ntool of personal and unlawful ambition.  The Lorraine princes, it is\r\ntrue, were less foreign to France than the King of Spain was; they had\r\neven rendered her eminent service; but they had no right to the crown.\r\nMayenne had opposed to him the native and lawful heir to the throne,\r\nalready recognized and invested with the kingly power by a large portion\r\nof France, and quite capable of disputing his kingship with the ablest\r\ncompetitors.  By himself and with his own party alone, Mayenne was not in\r\na position to maintain such a struggle; in order to have any chance he\r\nmust have recourse to the prince whose partisans he had just overthrown\r\nand chastised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles de Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne----35]\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of November, 1591, Henry IV. had laid siege to Rouen with a\r\nstrong force, and was pushing the operations on vigorously.  In order to\r\nobtain the troops and money without which he could not relieve this\r\nimportant place, the leader of the French League treated humbly with the\r\npatron of the Spanish League.  “In the conferences held at La Fere and at\r\nLihom-Saintot, between the 10th and the 18th of January, 1592,” says M.\r\nPoirson, “the Duke of Parma, acting for the King of Spain, and Mayenne\r\ndrew up conventions which only awaited.  the ratification of Philip II.\r\nto be converted into a treaty.  Mayenne was to receive four millions of\r\ncrowns a year and a Spanish army, which together would enable him to\r\noppose Henry IV.  He had, besides, a promise of a large establishment for\r\nhimself, his relatives, and the chiefs of his party.  In exchange, he\r\npromised, in his own name and that of the princes of his house and the\r\ngreat lords of the League, that Philip II.’s daughter, the Infanta\r\nIsabella (Clara Eugenia), should be recognized as sovereign and\r\nproprietress of the throne of France, and that the states-general,\r\nconvoked for that purpose, should proclaim her right and confer upon her\r\nthe throne.  It is true,” adds M. Poirson, “that Mayenne stipulated that\r\nthe Infanta should take a husband, within the year, at the suggestion of\r\nthe councillors and great officers of the crown, that the kingdom should\r\nbe preserved in its entirety, and that its laws and customs should be\r\nmaintained.  .  .  .  It even appears certain that Mayenne purposed not\r\nto keep any of these promises, and to emend his infamy by a breach of\r\nfaith.  .  .  .  But a conviction generally prevailed that he recognized\r\nthe rights of the Infanta, and that he would labor to place her on the\r\nthrone.  The lords of his own party believed it; the legate reported it\r\neverywhere; the royal party regarded it as certain.  During the whole\r\ncourse of the year 1592, this opinion gave the most disastrous assistance\r\nto the intrigues and ascendency of Philip II., and added immeasurably to\r\nthe public dangers.”  [Poirson, _Histoire du Regne d’Henri IV.,_  t.  i.\r\npp.  304-306.]\r\n\r\nWhilst these two Leagues, one Spanish and the other French, were\r\nconspiring thus persistently, sometimes together and sometimes one\r\nagainst the other, to promote personal ambition and interests, at the\r\nsame time national instinct, respect for traditional rights, weariness of\r\ncivil war, and the good sense which is born of long experience, were\r\nbringing France more and more over to the cause and name of Henry IV.\r\nIn all the provinces, throughout all ranks of society, the population\r\nnon-enrolled amongst the factions were turning their eyes towards him as\r\nthe only means of putting an end to war at home and abroad, the only\r\npledge of national unity, public prosperity, and even freedom of trade, a\r\nhazy idea as yet, but even now prevalent in the great ports of France and\r\nin Paris.  Would Henry turn Catholic?  That was the question asked\r\neverywhere, amongst Protestants with anxiety, but with keen desire, and\r\nnot without hope, amongst the mass of the population.  The rumor ran\r\nthat, on this point, negotiations were half opened even in the midst of\r\nthe League itself, even at the court of Spain, even at Rome, where Pope\r\nClement VIII., a more moderate man than his predecessor, Gregory XIV.,\r\n“had no desire,” says Sully, “to foment the troubles of France, and still\r\nless that the King of Spain should possibly become its undisputed king,\r\nrightly judging that this would be laying open to him the road to the\r\nmonarchy of Christendom, and, consequently, reducing the Roman pontiffs\r\nto the position, if it were his good pleasure, of his mere chaplains.”\r\n [_OEconomies royales,_ t. ii.  p. 106.] Such being the existing state of\r\nfacts and minds, it was impossible that Henry IV. should not ask himself\r\nroundly the same question, and feel that he had no time to lose in\r\nanswering it.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of February, 1593, he sent for Rosny, one evening very\r\nlate.  “And so,” says Rosny, “I found his Majesty in bed, having already\r\nwished every one a good night; who, as soon as he saw me come in, ordered\r\na hassock to be brought and me to kneel thereon against his bed, and said\r\nto me, ‘My friend, I have sent for you so late for to speak with you\r\nabout the things that are going on, and to hear your opinions thereon; I\r\nconfess that I have often found them better than those of many others who\r\nmake great show of being clever.  If you continue to leave me the care of\r\nthat which concerns you, and yourself to take continual care of my\r\naffairs, we shall both of us find it to our welfare.  I do not wish to\r\nhide any longer that for a long time past I have had my eye upon you in\r\norder to employ you personally in my most important affairs, especially\r\nin those of my finances, for I hold you to be honest and painstaking.\r\nFor the present, I wish to speak with you about that large number of\r\npersons of all parties, all ranks, and different tempers, who would be\r\ndelighted to exert themselves for the pacification of the kingdom,\r\nespecially if I can resolve to make some arrangement as regards religion.\r\nI am quite resolved not to hear of any negotiation or treaty, save on\r\nthese two conditions, that some result may be looked for tending both\r\nto the advantage of the people of my kingdom and to the real\r\nre-establishment of the kingly authority.  I know that it is your custom,\r\nwhenever I put anything before you, to ask me for time to think well\r\nthereon before you are disposed to tell me your opinion; in three or four\r\ndays I shall send for you to tell me what has occurred to you touching\r\nall these fine hopes that many would have me anticipate from their\r\ninterventions; all of them persons very diverse in temper, purposes,\r\ninterests, functions, and religion.”\r\n\r\n“Whereupon,” says Rosny, “the king having dismissed me with a good\r\nevening, he did not fail to send for me again three days afterwards, in\r\norder that I should go and see him again in bed, near the which having\r\nmade me kneel as before, he said, ‘Come, now, tell me this moment, and\r\nquite at leisurely length, all your foolish fancies, for so you have\r\nalways called the best counsels you have ever given me, touching the\r\nquestions I put to you the other evening.  I am ready to listen to you\r\nright on to the end, without interrupting you.’”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Rosny, “I have reflected not only on what your Majesty was\r\npleased to tell me three days ago, but also on what I have been able to\r\nlearn, as to the same affairs, from divers persons of all qualities and\r\nreligions, and even women who have talked to me in order to make me talk,\r\nand to see if I knew any particulars of your private intentions.  .  .  .\r\nAs it seems to me, sir, all these goings, comings, writings, letters,\r\njourneys, interventions, parleys, and conferences cannot be better\r\ncompared than to that swarming of attorneys at the courts, who take a\r\nthousand turns and walks about the great hall, under pretence of settling\r\ncases, and all the while it is they who give them birth, and would be\r\nvery sorry for a single one to die off.  In the next place, not a single\r\none of them troubles himself about right or wrong, provided that the\r\ncrowns are forthcoming, and that, by dint of lustily shouting, they are\r\nreputed eloquent, learned, and well stocked with inventions and\r\nsubtleties.  Consequently, sir, without troubling yourself further with\r\nthese treaty-mongers and negotiators, who do nothing but lure you, bore\r\nyou, perplex your mind, and fill with doubts and scruples the minds of\r\nyour subjects, I opine, in a few words, that you must still for some time\r\nexercise great address, patience, and prudence, in order that there may\r\nbe engendered amongst all this mass of confusion, anarchy, and chimera,\r\nthat they call the holy catholic union, so many and such opposite\r\ndesires, jealousies, pretensions, hatreds, longings, and designs, that,\r\nat last, all the French there are amongst them must come and throw\r\nthemselves into your arms, bit by bit, recognize your kingship alone as\r\npossible, and look to nothing but it for protection, prop, or stay.\r\nNevertheless, sir, that your Majesty may not regard me as a spirit of\r\ncontradiction for having found nothing good in all these proposals made\r\nto you by these great negotiators, I will add to my suggestions just one\r\nthing; if a bit of Catholicism were quite agreeable to you, if it were\r\nproperly embraced and accepted accordingly, in honorable and suitable\r\nform, it would be of great service, might serve as cement between you and\r\nall your Catholic subjects; and it would even facilitate your other great\r\nand magnificent designs whereof you have sometimes spoken to me.\r\nTouching this, I would say more to you about it if I were of such\r\nprofession as permitted me to do so with a good conscience; I content\r\nmyself, as it is, with leaving yours to do its work within you on so\r\nticklish and so delicate a subject.”\r\n\r\n“I quite understand your opinions,” said the king; “they resolve\r\nthemselves almost into one single point: I must not allow the\r\nestablishment of any association or show of government having the least\r\nappearance of being able to subsist, by itself or by its members, in any\r\npart of my kingdom, or suffer dismemberment in respect of any one of the\r\nroyal prerogatives, as regards things spiritual as well as temporal.\r\nSuch is my full determination.”\r\n\r\n“I answered the king,” continues Rosny, “that I was rejoiced to see him\r\ntaking so intelligent a view of his affairs, and that, for the present, I\r\nhad no advice to give him but to seek repose of body and mind, and to\r\npermit me likewise to seek the same for myself, for I was dead sleepy,\r\nnot having slept for two nights; and so, without a word more, the king\r\ngave me good night, and, as for me, I went back to my quarters.”\r\n\r\nA few days before this conversation between the king and his friend\r\nRosny, on the 26th of January, 1593, the states-general of the League\r\nhad met in the great hall of the Louvre, present the Duke of Mayenne,\r\nsurrounded by all the pomp of royalty, but so nervous that his speech in\r\nopening the session was hardly audible, and that he frequently changed\r\ncolor during its delivery.  On leaving, his wife told him that she was\r\nafraid he was not well, as she had seen him turn pale three or four\r\ntimes.  A hundred and twenty-eight deputies had been elected; only fifty\r\nwere present at this first meeting.  They adjourned to the 4th of\r\nFebruary.  In the interval, on the 28th of January, there had arrived,\r\nalso, a royalist trumpeter, bringing, “on behalf of the princes,\r\nprelates, officers of the crown, and principal lords of the Catholic\r\nfaith, who were with the King of Navarre, an offer of a conference\r\nbetween the two parties, for to lay down the basis of a peace eagerly\r\ndesired.”  On hearing this message, Cardinal Pelleve, Archbishop of Sens,\r\none of the most fiery prelates of the League, said, “that he was of\r\nopinion that the trumpeter should be whipped, to teach him not to\r\nundertake such silly errands for the future;”  “an opinion,” said\r\nsomebody, “quite worthy of a thick head like his, wherein there is but\r\nlittle sense.”\r\n\r\nThe states-general of the League were of a different opinion.  After long\r\nand lively discussion, the three orders decided, each separately, on the\r\n25th of February, to consent to the conference demanded by the friends of\r\nthe King of Navarre.  On the 4th of February, when they resumed session,\r\nCardinal Philip de Sega, Bishop of Placencia (in Spain) and legate of\r\nPope Clement VIII., had requested to be present at the deliberation of\r\nthe assembly, but his request was refused; the states confined themselves\r\nto receiving his benediction and hearing him deliver an address.\r\n\r\nThe different fate of these two proposals was a clear indication of the\r\nfeelings of the assembly; they were very diverse in the three orders\r\nwhich constituted it; almost all the clergy, prelates, and popular\r\npreachers were devoted to the Spanish League; the noblesse were not at\r\nall numerous at these states.  “The most brilliant and most active\r\nmembers of it,” says M. Picot correctly, “had ranged themselves behind\r\nHenry IV.; and it covered itself with eternal honor by having been the\r\nfirst to discern where to look for the hopes and the salvation of\r\nFrance.”  The third estate was very much divided; it contained the\r\nfanatical Leaguers, at the service of Philip II. and the court of Rome,\r\nthe partisans, much more numerous, of the French League, who desired\r\npeace, and were ready to accept Henry IV., provided that he turned\r\nCatholic, and a small band of political spirits, more powerful in talent\r\nthan number.\r\n\r\nRegularly as the deputies arrived, Mayenne went to each of them, saying\r\nprivately, “Gentlemen, you see what the question is; it is the very\r\nchiefest of all matters (_res maxima rerum agitur_).  I beg you to give\r\nyour best attention to it, and to so act that the adversaries steal no\r\nmarch on us and get no advantage over us.  Nevertheless, I mean to abide\r\nby what I have promised them.”  Mayenne was quite right: it was certainly\r\nthe chiefest of all matters.  The head of the Protestants of France, the\r\nally of all the Protestants in Europe--should he become a Catholic and\r\nKing of France?  The temporal head of Catholic Europe, the King of Spain\r\n--should he abolish the Salic law in France, by placing upon it his\r\ndaughter as queen, and dismember France to his own profit and that of the\r\nleaders of the League, his hirelings rather than his allies?  Or,\r\nperadventure, should one of these Leaguer-chiefs be he who should take\r\nthe crown of France, and found a new dynasty there?  And which of these\r\nLeaguer-chiefs should attain this good fortune?  A half-German or a true\r\nFrenchman?  A Lorraine prince or a Bourbon?  And, if a Lorraine prince,\r\nwhich?  The Duke of Mayenne, military head of the League, or his uterine\r\nbrother, the Duke of Nemours, or his nephew the young Duke of Guise, son\r\nof the Balafrc?  All these questions were mooted, all these pretensions\r\nwere on the cards, all these combinations had their special intrigue.\r\nAnd in the competition upon which they entered with one another, at the\r\nsame time that they were incessantly laying traps for one another, they\r\nkept up towards one another, because of the uncertainty of their chances,\r\na deceptive course of conduct often amounting to acts of downright\r\ntreachery committed without scruple, in order to preserve for themselves\r\na place and share in the unknown future towards which they were moving.\r\nIt was in order to have his opinion upon a position so dark and\r\ncomplicated, and upon the behavior it required, that Henry IV., then at\r\nMantes, sent once more for Rosny, and had a second conversation, a few\r\nweeks later, with him.\r\n\r\n“Well! my friend,” said the king, “what say you about all these plots\r\nthat are being projected against my conscience, my life, and my kingdom?\r\nSince the death of the Duke of Parma [on the 2d of December, 1592, in the\r\nAbbey of St. Waast at Arras, from the consequences of a wound received in\r\nthe preceding April at the siege of Caudebec], it seems that deeds of\r\narms have given place to intrigues and contests of words.  I fancy that\r\nsuch gentry will never leave me at rest, and will at last, perhaps,\r\nattempt my liberty and my life.  I beg you to tell me your opinion\r\nfreely, and what remedies, short of cruelty and violence, I might now\r\nemploy to get rid of all these hinderances and cabals (monopoles) that\r\nare going on against the rights which have come to me by the will of God,\r\nby birth, and by the laws of the realm.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Rosny, “I do not fancy that deferments and temporizations,\r\nany more than long speeches, would now be seasonable; there are, it seems\r\nto me, but two roads to take to deliver yourself from peril, but not from\r\nanxiety, for from anxiety kings and princes, the greater they are, can\r\nthe less secure themselves if they wish to reign successfully.  One of\r\nthe two roads is to accommodate yourself to the desires and wishes of\r\nthose of whom you feel distrust; the other, to secure the persons of\r\nthose who are the most powerful, and of the highest rank, and most\r\nsuspected by you, and put them in such place as will prevent them from\r\ndoing you hurt; you know them pretty nearly all; there are some of them\r\nvery rich; you will be able for a long while to carry, on war.  As for\r\nadvising you to go to mass, it is a thing that you ought not, it seems to\r\nme, to expect from me, who am of the religion; but frankly will I tell\r\nyou that it is the readiest and the easiest means of confounding all\r\nthese cabals (_monopoles_), and causing all the most mischievous projects\r\nto end in smoke.”\r\n\r\nThe King:  “But tell me freely, I beg of you, what you would do if you\r\nwere in my place.”\r\n\r\nRosny:  I can assure you honestly, sir, that I have never thought about\r\nwhat I should feel bound to do for to be king, it having always seemed to\r\nme that I had not a head able or intended to wear a crown.  As to your\r\nMajesty it is another affair; in you, sir, that desire is not only\r\nlaudable, but necessary, as it does not appear now this realm can be\r\nrestored to its greatness, opulence, and splendor but by the sole means\r\nof your eminent worth and downright kingly courage.  But whatever right\r\nyou have to the kingdom, and whatever need it has of your courage and\r\nworth for its restoration, you will never arrive at complete possession\r\nand peaceable enjoyment of this dominion but by two sole expedients and\r\nmeans.  In case of the first, which is force and arms, you will have to\r\nemploy strong measures, severity, rigor, and violence, processes which\r\nare all utterly opposed to your temper and inclination: you will have to\r\npass through an infinity of difficulties, fatigues, pains, annoyances,\r\nperils, and labors, with a horse perpetually between your legs, harness\r\n[_halecret,_ a species of light cuirass] on back, helmet on head, pistol\r\nin fist, and sword in hand.  And, what is more, you will have to bid\r\nadieu to repose, pleasure, pastime, love, mistress, play, hunting,\r\nhawking, and building; for you will not get out of such matters but by\r\nmultiplicity of town-takings, quantity of fights, signal victories, and\r\ngreat bloodshed.  By the other road, which is to accommodate yourself,\r\nas regards religion, to the wish of the greatest number of your subjects,\r\nyou will not encounter so many annoyances, pains, and difficulties in\r\nthis world, but as to the next, I don’t answer for you; it is for your\r\nMajesty to take a fixed resolution for yourself, without adopting it from\r\nany one else, and less from me than from any other, as you well know that\r\nI am of the religion, and that you keep me by you not as a theologian and\r\ncouncillor of church, but as a man of action and councillor of state,\r\nseeing that you have given me that title, and for a long space employed\r\nme as such.”\r\n\r\nThe king burst out laughing, and, sitting up in his bed, said, after\r\nscratching his head several times, to Rosny,--\r\n\r\n“All you say to me is true; but I see so many thorns on every side that\r\nit will go very hard but some of them will prick me full sore.  You know\r\nwell enough that my cousins, the princes of the blood, and ever so many\r\nother lords, such as D’Epernon, Longueville, Biron, d’O, and Vitry, are\r\nurging me to turn Catholic, or else they will join the League.  On the\r\nother hand, I know for certain that Messieurs de Turenne, de la\r\nTremoille, and their lot, are laboring daily to have a demand made, if I\r\nturn Catholic, on behalf of them of the religion, for an assembly to\r\nappoint them a protector and an establishment of councils in the\r\nprovinces; all things that I could not put up with.  But if I had to\r\ndeclare war against them to prevent it, it would be the greatest\r\nannoyance and trouble that could ever happen to me: my heart could not\r\nbear to do ill to those who have so long run my risks, and have employed\r\ntheir goods and their lives in my defence.”\r\n\r\nAt these last words, Rosny threw himself upon his knees, with his eyes\r\nfull of tears, and, kissing the king’s hands, he said, “Sir, I am\r\nrejoiced beyond measure to see you so well disposed towards them of the\r\nreligion.  I have always been afraid that, if you came to change your\r\nreligion, as I see full well that you will have to do, you might be\r\npersuaded to hate and maltreat those of us others, of the towns as well\r\nas of the noblesse, who will always love you heartily and serve you\r\nfaithfully.  And be assured that the number thereof will be so great\r\nthat, if there rise up amongst them any avaricious, ambitious, and\r\nfactious, who would fain do the contrary, these will be constrained by\r\nthe others to return to their duty.  What would, in my opinion, be very\r\nnecessary, would be to prevail upon the zealous Catholics to change that\r\nbelief which they are so anxious to have embraced by all the rest, to\r\nwit, that they of the religion are all damned.  There are certainly,\r\nalso, some ministers and other obtrusive spirits amongst the Huguenots\r\nwho would fain persuade us of the same as regards Catholics; for my own\r\npart, I believe nothing of the kind; I hold it, on the contrary, as\r\nindisputable that, of whatever religion men make outward profession,\r\nif they die keeping the Decalogue and believing in the Creed (Apostles’),\r\nif they love God with all their heart and are charitable towards their\r\nneighbor, if they put their hopes in God’s mercy and in obtaining\r\nsalvation by the death, merits, and justice of Jesus Christ, they cannot\r\nfail to be saved, because they are then no longer of any erroneous\r\nreligion, but of that which is most agreeable to God.  If you were\r\npleased to embrace it and put it in practice all the days of your life,\r\nnot only should I have no doubt of your salvation, but I should remain\r\nquite assured that, not regarding us as execrable and damned, you would\r\nnever proceed to the destruction or persecution of those of our religion\r\nwho shall love you truly and serve you faithfully.  From all such\r\nreflections and discourse I conclude that it will be impossible for you\r\never to reign in peace so long as you make outward profession of a\r\nreligion which is held in such great aversion by the majority of both\r\ngreat and small in your kingdom, and that you cannot hope to raise it to\r\nsuch general splendor, wealth, and happiness as I have observed you often\r\nprojecting.  Still less could you flatter yourself with the idea of ever\r\narriving at the accomplishment of your lofty and magnifi cent designs for\r\nthe establishment of a universal most Christian republic, composed of all\r\nthe kings and potentates of Europe who profess the name of Christ; for,\r\nin order to bring about so great a blessing, you must needs have tranquil\r\npossession of a great, rich, opulent, and populous kingdom, and be in a\r\ncondition to enter into great and trustworthy foreign associations.”\r\n [_OEconomies royales, or Memoires de Sully,_ t. ii.  pp. 81-100.] One is\r\ninclined to believe that, even before their conversations, Henry IV. was\r\nvery near being of Rosny’s opinion; but it is a long stride from an\r\nopinion to a resolution.  In spite of the breadth and independence of his\r\nmind, Henry IV. was sincerely puzzled.  He was of those who, far from\r\nclinging to a single fact and confining themselves to a single duty, take\r\naccount of the complication of the facts amidst which they live, and of\r\nthe variety of the duties which the general situation or their own\r\nimposes upon them.  Born in the Reformed faith, and on the steps of the\r\nthrone, he was struggling to defend his political rights whilst keeping\r\nhis religious creed; but his religious creed was not the fruit of very\r\nmature or very deep conviction; it was a question of first claims and of\r\nhonor rather than a matter of conscience; and, on the other hand, the\r\npeace of France, her prosperity, perhaps her territorial integrity, were\r\ndependent upon the triumph of the political rights of the Bearnese.  Even\r\nfor his brethren in creed his triumph was a benefit secured, for it was\r\nan end of persecution and a first step towards liberty.  There is no\r\nmeasuring accurately how far ambition, personal interest, a king’s\r\negotism, had to do with Henry’s IV.’s abjuration of his religion; none\r\nwould deny that those human infirmities were present; but all this does\r\nnot prevent the conviction that patriotism was uppermost in Henry’s soul,\r\nand that the idea of his duty as king towards France, a prey to all the\r\nevils of civil and foreign war, was the determining motive of his\r\nresolution.  It cost him a great deal.  To the Huguenot gentry and\r\npeasantry who had fought with him he said, “You desire peace; I give it\r\nyou at my own expense; I have made myself anathema for the sake of all,\r\nlike Moses and St. Paul.”  He received with affectionate sadness the\r\nReformed ministers and preachers who came to see him.  “Kindly pray to\r\nGod for me,” said he to them, “and love me always; as for me, I shall\r\nalways love you, and I will never suffer wrong to be done to you, or any\r\nviolence to your religion.”  He had already, at this time, the Edict of\r\nNantes in his mind, and he let a glimpse of it appear to Rosny at their\r\nfirst conversation.  When he discussed with the Catholic prelates the\r\nconditions of his abjuration, he had those withdrawn which would have\r\nbeen too great a shock to his personal feelings and shackled his con duct\r\ntod much in the government, as would have been the case with the promise\r\nto labor for the destruction of heresy.  Even as regarded the Catholic\r\nfaith, he demand of the doctors who were preparing him for it some\r\nlatitude for his own thoughts, and “that he should not have such violence\r\ndone to his conscience as to be bound to strange oaths, and to sign and\r\nbelieve rubbish which he was quite sure that the majority of them did not\r\nbelieve.”  [_Memoires de L’Estoile,_ t. ii.  p. 472.] The most passionate\r\nProtestants of his own time reproached him, and some still reproach him,\r\nwith having deserted his creed and having repaid with ingratitude his\r\nmost devoted comrades in arms and brothers in Christ.  Perhaps there is\r\nsome ingratitude also in forgetting that after four years of struggling\r\nto obtain the mastery for his religious creed and his political rights\r\nsimultaneously, Henry IV., convinced that he could not succeed in that,\r\nput a stop to religious wars, and founded, to last for eighty-seven\r\nyears, the free and lawful practice of the Reformed worship in France,\r\nby virtue of the Edict of Nantes, which will be spoken of presently.\r\n\r\nWhilst this great question was thus discussed and decided between Henry\r\nIV. in person and his principal advisers, the states-general of the\r\nLeague and the conference of Suresnes were vainly bestirring themselves\r\nin the attempt to still keep the mastery of events which were slipping\r\naway from them.  The Leaguer states had an appearance of continuing to\r\nwish for the absolute proscription of Henry IV., a heretic king, even on\r\nconversion to Catholicism, so long as his conversion was not recognized\r\nand accepted by the pope; but there was already great, though timidly\r\nexpressed, dissent as to this point in the assembly of the states and\r\namongst the population in the midst of which it was living.  Nearly a\r\nyear previously, in May, 1592, when he retired from France after having\r\nrelieved Rouen from siege and taken Caudebec, the Duke of Parma, as\r\nclear-sighted a politician as he was able soldier, had said to one of the\r\nmost determined Leaguers, “Your people have abated their fury; the rest\r\nhold on but faintly, and in a short time they will have nothing to do\r\nwith us.”  Philip II. and Mayenne perceived before long the urgency and\r\nthe peril of this situation: they exerted themselves, at one time in\r\nconcert and at another independently, to make head against this change in\r\nthe current of thoughts and facts.  Philip sent to Paris an ambassador\r\nextraordinary, the Duke of Feria, to treat with the states of the League\r\nand come to an understanding with Mayenne; but Mayenne considered that\r\nthe Duke of Feria did not bring enough money, and did not introduce\r\nenough soldiers; the Spanish army in France numbered but four thousand\r\nthree hundred men, and Philip had put at his ambassador’s disposal but\r\ntwo hundred thousand crowns, or six hundred thousand livres of those\r\ntimes; yet had he ordered that, in respect of the assembly, the pay\r\nshould not come until after the service was rendered, i.e. after a vote\r\nwas given in favor of his election or that of his daughter the Infanta\r\nIsabella to the throne.  It was not the states-general only who had to be\r\nwon over; the preachers of the League were also, at any rate the majority\r\nof them, covetous as well as fiery; both the former and the latter soon\r\nsaw that the Duke of Feria had not wherewith to satisfy them.  “And such\r\nas had come,” says Villeroi, “with a disposition to favor the Spaniards\r\nand serve them for a consideration, despised them and spoke ill of them,\r\nseeing that there was nothing to be gained from them.”  The artifices of\r\nMayenne were scarcely more successful than the stingy presents of\r\nPhilip II.; when the Lorrainer duke saw the chances of Spain in the\r\nascendant as regarded the election of a King of France and the marriage\r\nof the Infanta Isabella, he at once set to work--and succeeded without\r\nmuch difficulty--to make them a failure; at bottom, it was always for the\r\nhouse of Lorraine, whether for the marriage of his nephew the Duke of\r\nGuise with the Infanta Isabella or for the prolongation of his power,\r\nthat Mayenne labored; he sometimes managed to excite, for the promotion\r\nof this cause, a favorable movement amongst the states-general or a blast\r\nof wrath on the part of the preachers against Henry IV.; but it was\r\nnothing but a transitory and fruitless effort; the wind no longer sat in\r\nthe sails of the League; on the 27th of May, 1593, a deputation of a\r\nhundred and twenty burgesses, with the provost of tradesmen at their\r\nhead, repaired to the house of Count de Belin, governor of Paris, begging\r\nhim to introduce them into the presence of the Duke of Mayenne, to whom\r\nthey wished to make a demand for peace, and saying that their request\r\nwould, at need, be signed by ten thousand burgesses.  Next day, two\r\ncolonels of the burgess-militia spoke of making barricades; four days\r\nafterwards, some of the most famous and but lately most popular preachers\r\nof the League were hooted and insulted by the people, who shouted at them\r\nas they passed in the streets that drowning was the due of all those\r\ndeputies in the states who prevented peace from being made.  The\r\nconference assembled at Suresnes, of which mention has already been\r\nmade, had been formed with pacific intentions, or, at any rate, hopes;\r\naccordingly it was more tranquil than the states-general, but it was not\r\na whit more efficacious.  It was composed of thirteen delegates for the\r\nLeague and eight for the king, men of consideration in the two parties.\r\nAt the opening of its sessions, the first time the delegates of the\r\nLeague repaired thither, a great crowd shouted at them, “Peace!  Peace!\r\nBlessed be they who procure it and demand it!  Malediction and every\r\ndevil take all else!”  In the villages they passed through, the peasantry\r\nthrew themselves upon their knees, and, with clasped hands, demanded of\r\nthem peace.  The conference was in session from the 4th of May to the\r\n11th of June, holding many discussions, always temperately and with due\r\nregard for propriety, but without arriving at any precise solution of the\r\nquestions proposed.  Clearly neither to this conference nor to the\r\nstates-general of the League was it given to put an end to this stormy\r\nand at the same time resultless state of things; Henry IV. alone could\r\ntake the resolution and determine the issue which everybody was awaiting\r\nwith wistfulness or with dread, but without being able to accomplish it.\r\nD’Aubigne ends his account of the conference at Suresnes with these\r\nwords: “Those who were present at it reported to the king that there were\r\namongst the Leaguers so many heart-burnings and so much confusion that\r\nthey were all seeking, individually if not collectively, some pretext for\r\nsurrendering to the king, and consequently, that one mass would settle it\r\nentirely.”  [_Histoire Universelle,_ bk. iii.  chap. xx.  p. 386.]\r\n\r\nPowers that are conscious of their opportuneness and utility do not like\r\nto lose time, but are prompt to act.  Shortly after his conversations\r\nwith Rosny, whose opinion was confirmed by that of Chancellor de Chiverny\r\nand Count Gaspard de Schomberg, Henry IV. set to work.  On the 26th of\r\nApril, 1593, he wrote to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand de’ Medici,\r\nthat he had decided to turn Catholic “two months after that the Duke of\r\nMayenne should have come to an agreement with him on just and suitable\r\nterms;” and, foreseeing the expense that would be occasioned to him by\r\n“this great change in his affairs,” he felicitated himself upon knowing\r\nthat the grand duke was disposed to second his efforts towards a levy of\r\nfour thousand Swiss, and advance a year’s pay for them.  On the 28th of\r\nApril, he begged the Bishop of Chartres, Nicholas de Thou, to be one of\r\nthe Catholic prelates whose instructions he would be happy to receive on\r\nthe 15th of July, and he sent the same invitation to several other\r\nprelates.  On the 16th of May, he declared to his council his resolve to\r\nbecome a convert.  Next day, the 17th, the Archbishop of Bourges\r\nannounced it to the conference at Suresnes.  This news, everywhere spread\r\nabroad, produced a lively burst of national and Bourbonic feeling even\r\nwhere it was scarcely to be expected; at the states-general of the\r\nLeague, especially in the chamber of the noblesse, many members protested\r\n“that they would not treat with foreigners, or promote the election of a\r\nwoman, or give their suffrages to any one unknown to them, and at the\r\nchoice of his Catholic Majesty of Spain.”  At Paris, a part of the\r\nclergy, the incumbents of St. Eustache, St. Merri, and St. Sulpice, and\r\neven some of the popular preachers, violent Leaguers but lately, and\r\nnotably Guincestre, boldly preached peace and submission to the king if\r\nhe turned Catholic.  The principal of the French League, in matters of\r\npolicy and negotiation, and Mayenne’s adviser since 1589, Villeroi,\r\ndeclared “that he would not bide in a place where the laws, the honor of\r\nthe nation, and the independence of the kingdom were held so cheap;” and\r\nhe left Paris on the 28th of June.  Finally, on this same day, the\r\nParliament of Paris, all chambers assembled, issued a decree known by the\r\nname of the decree of President Lemaitre, who had the chief hand in it,\r\nand conceived as follows:--\r\n\r\n“The court, having, as it has always had, no intention but to maintain\r\nthe Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion, and the state and crown of\r\nFrance, under the protection of a most Christian, Catholic, and French\r\nking, hath ordained and doth ordain that representations shall be made,\r\nthis afternoon, by President Lemaitre, assisted by a proper number of\r\ncouncillors of the said court, to the Duke of Mayenne, lieutenant-general\r\nof the state and crown of France, to the end that no treaty be made for\r\nthe transfer of the crown to the hands of foreign princes or princesses,\r\nand that the fundamental laws of the realm be observed.  .  .  .  And\r\nfrom the present moment, the said court hath declared and doth declare\r\nall treaties made or hereafter to be made for the setting up of foreign\r\nprince or princess null and of no effect or value, as being made to the\r\nprejudice of the Salic law and other fundamental laws of this realm.”\r\n\r\nIt was understood that this decree excluded from the crown of France not\r\nonly Philip II., the Infanta Isabella, Archduke Ernest, and all the\r\nSpanish and Austrian princes, but also all the princes of the house of\r\nGuise, “because the qualification of foreigners applied to all the\r\nprinces who were not of the blood royal and who were issue of foreign\r\nhouses, even though they might have been born in France and were\r\nregnicoles.”\r\n\r\nMayenne refused, it is not known on what pretext, to receive the\r\ncommunication of this decree on the same day on which it was voted by the\r\nParliament.  When President Lemaitre presented it to him the next day\r\nbefore a large attendance, Mayenne kept his temper, and confined himself\r\nto replying gruffly, “My first care has always been to defend the\r\nCatholic religion and maintain the laws of the realm.  It seems now that\r\nI am no longer necessary to the state, and that it will be easy to do\r\nwithout me.  I could have wished, considering my position, that the\r\nParliament had not decided anything in a matter of such importance\r\nwithout consulting me.  However, I will do all that I find possible for\r\nme and that appears reasonable as to the two points of your\r\nrepresentations.”  On the following day, 30th of June, Mayenne was dining\r\nwith the Archbishop of Lyons, Peter d’Espinac; President Lemaitre was\r\nsent for, and the wrath of the lieutenant-general burst forth.  “The\r\ninsult put upon me is too palpable for me to be quiet under it; since I\r\nam played fast and loose with in that way, I have resolved to quash the\r\ndecree of the Parliament.  The Archbishop of Lyons is about to explain to\r\nyou my feelings and my motives.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lemaitre, Mayenne, and the Archbishop of Lyons----53]\r\n\r\nThe archbishop spoke long and bitterly, dwelling upon the expression that\r\n“the Parliament had played fast and loose “ with the prince.  President\r\nLemaitre interrupted him.  “I cannot unmoved hear you repeating, sir,\r\nthat to which my respect made me shut my eyes when the prince spoke.\r\nLooking upon me as an individual, you might speak to me in any way, you\r\nthought proper; but so soon as the body I represent here is injured by\r\ninsulting terms, I take offence, and I cannot suffer it.  Know then, sir,\r\nthat the Parliament does not deceive or play fast and loose with anybody,\r\nand that it renders to every man his due.”  The conversation was\r\ncontinued for some moments in this warm and serious tone; but the quarrel\r\nwent no further; from the account they received of it, the Parliament\r\napplauded the premier president’s firmness, and all the members swore\r\nthat they would suffer anything rather than that there should be any\r\nchange in the decree.  It remained intact, and Mayenne said no more about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDuring these disputes amongst the civil functionaries, and continuing all\r\nthe while to make proposals for a general truce, Henry IV. vigorously\r\nresumed warlike operations, so as to bring pressure upon his adversaries\r\nand make them perceive the necessity of accepting the solution he offered\r\nthem.  He besieged and took the town of Dreux, of which the castle alone\r\npersisted in holding out.  He cut off the provisions which were being\r\nbrought by the Marne to Paris.  He kept Poitiers strictly invested.\r\nLesdiguieres defeated the Savoyards and the Spaniards in the valleys of\r\nDauphiny and Piedmont.  Count Mansfeld was advancing with a division\r\ntowards Picardy; but at the news that the king was marching to encounter\r\nhim, he retired with precipitation.  From the military as well as the\r\npolitical point of view, there is no condition worse than that of\r\nstubbornness mingled with discouragement.  And that was the state of\r\nMayenne and the League.  Henry IV. perceived it, and confidently hurried\r\nforward his political and military measures.  The castle of Dreux was\r\nobliged to capitulate.  Thanks to the four thousand Swiss paid for him by\r\nthe Grand Duke of Florence, to the numerous volunteers brought to him by\r\nthe noblesse of his party, “and to the sterling quality of the old\r\nHuguenot phalanx, folks who, from father to son, are familiarized with\r\ndeath,” says D’Aubigne, Henry IV. had recovered, in June, 1593, so good\r\nan army that “by means of it,” he wrote to Ferdinand de’ Medici, “I shall\r\nbe able to reduce the city of Paris in so short a time as will cause you\r\ngreat contentment.”  But he was too judicious and too good a patriot not\r\nto see that it was not by an indefinitely prolonged war that he would be\r\nenabled to enter upon definitive possession of his crown, and that it was\r\npeace, religious peace, that he must restore to France in order to really\r\nbecome her king.  He entered resolutely, on the 15th of July, 1593, upon\r\nthe employment of the moral means which alone could enable him to attain\r\nthis end; he assembled at Mantes the conference of prelates and doctors,\r\nCatholic and Protestant, which he had announced as the preface to his\r\nconversion.  He had previously, on the 13th of May, given assurance to\r\nthe Protestants as to their interests by means of a declaration on the\r\npart of eight amongst the principal Catholic lords attached to his person\r\nwho undertook, “with his Majesty’s authorization, that nothing should be\r\ndone in the said assemblies to the prejudice of friendly union between\r\nthe Catholics who recognized his Majesty and them of the religion, or\r\ncontrary to the edicts of pacification.”  On the 21st of July, the\r\nprelates and doctors of the conference transferred themselves from Mantes\r\nto St. Denis.  On Friday, July 23, in the morning, Henry wrote to Gabriel\r\nle d’Estrees, “Sunday will be the day when I shall make the summerset\r\nthat brings down the house” (_le, saut perilleux_).  A few hours after\r\nusing such flippant language to his favorite, he was having a long\r\nconference with the prelates and doctors, putting to them the gravest\r\nquestions about the religion he was just embracing, asking them for more\r\nsatisfactory explanations on certain points, and repeating to them the\r\ngrounds of his resolution.  “I am moved with compassion at the misery and\r\ncalamities of my people; I have discovered what they desire; and I wish\r\nto be enabled, with a safe conscience, to content them.”  At the end of\r\nthe conference, “Gentlemen,” he said, “I this day commit my soul to your\r\nkeeping; I pray you, take heed to it, for, wheresoever you are causing me\r\nto enter, I shall never more depart till death; that I swear and protest\r\nto you;” and, in a voice of deep emotion, his eyes dim with tears, “I\r\ndesire no further delay; I wish to be received on Sunday and go to mass;\r\ndraw up the profession of faith you think I ought to make, and bring it\r\nto me this evening; “when the Archbishop of Bourges and the Bishops of Le\r\nMans and Evreux brought it to him on the Saturday morning, he discussed\r\nit apart with them, demanding the cutting out of some parts which struck\r\ntoo directly at his previous creed and life; and Chancellor de Chiverny\r\nand two presidents of the Parliament, Harlay and Groulart, used their\r\nintervention to have him satisfied.  The profession of faith was\r\nmodified.  Next day, Sunday, the 25th of July, before he got up, Henry\r\nconversed with the Protestant minister Anthony de la Faye, and embraced\r\nhim two or three times, repeating to him the words already quoted,\r\n“I have made myself anathema for the sake of all, like Moses and St.\r\nPaul.”  A painful mixture of the frivolous and the serious, of sincerity\r\nand captious reservations, of resolution and weakness, at which nobody\r\nhas any right to be shocked who is not determined to be pitiless towards\r\nhuman nature, and to make no allowance in the case of the best men for\r\ncomplication of the facts, ideas, sentiments, and duties, under the\r\ninfluence of which they are often obliged to decide and to act.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry IV.’s Abjuration----56]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the 25th of July, 1593, Henry IV. repaired in great state to\r\nthe church of St. Denis.  On arriving with all his train in front of the\r\ngrand entrance, he was received by Reginald de Beaune, Archbishop of\r\nBourges, the nine bishops, the doctors and the incumbents who had taken\r\npart in the conferences, and all the brethren of the abbey.  “Who are\r\nyou?” asked the archbishop who officiated.  “The king.”  “What want you?”\r\n “To be received into the bosom of the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman\r\nChurch.”  “Do you desire it?”  “Yes, I will and desire it.”  At these\r\nwords the king knelt and made the stipulated profession of faith.  The\r\narchbishop gave him absolution together with benediction; and, conducted\r\nby all the clergy to the choir of the church, he there, upon the gospels,\r\nrepeated his oath, made his confession, heard mass, and was fully\r\nreconciled with the church.  The inhabitants of Paris, dispensing with\r\nthe passports which were refused them by Mayenne, had flocked in masses\r\nto St. Denis and been present at the ceremony.  The vaulted roof of the\r\nchurch resounded with their shouts of Hurrah for the king!  There was the\r\nsame welcome on the part of the dwellers in the country when Henry\r\nrepaired to the valley of Montmorency and to Montmartre to perform his\r\ndevotions there.  Here, then, was religious peace, a prelude to political\r\nreconciliation between the monarch and the great majority of his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.----HENRY IV., CATHOLIC KING.  (1593-1610.)\r\n\r\nDuring the months, weeks, nay, it might be said, days immediately\r\nmediately following Henry IV.’s abjuration, a great number of notable\r\npersons and important towns, and almost whole provinces, submitted to the\r\nCatholic king.  Henry was reaping the fruits of his decision; France was\r\nflocking to him.  But the general sentiments of a people are far from\r\nsatisfying and subduing the selfish passions of the parties which have\r\ntaken form and root in its midst.  Religious and political peace\r\nresponded to and sufficed for the desires of the great majority of\r\nFrenchmen, Catholic and Protestant; but it did not at all content the\r\nfanatics, Leaguer or Huguenot.  The former wanted the complete\r\nextirpation of heretics; the latter the complete downfall of Catholicism.\r\nNeither these nor those were yet educated up to the higher principle of\r\nreligious peace, distinction between the civil and the intellectual\r\norder, freedom of thought and of faith guaranteed by political liberty.\r\nEven at the present day, the community of France, nation and government,\r\nall the while that they proclaim this great and salutary truth, do not\r\naltogether understand and admit its full bearing.  The sixteenth century\r\nwas completely ignorant of it; Leaguers and Huguenots were equally\r\nconvinced that they possessed, in the matter of religion, the truth, the\r\nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth, and that they were in their right\r\nto propagate its empire at any price.  Thence arose, in respect of\r\nreligious peace, and of Henry IV., who naturally desired it as the\r\nrequirement and the wish of France, a great governmental difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt is honorable to human nature that it never submits freely and\r\nsincerely to anything but what it considers not only useful, but\r\nessentially true and just; its passions bow to principles only; wherever\r\nthe higher principle is wanting, there also is wanting the force that\r\ncompels respect from passion.  Now the fanatics, Leaguer and Huguenot,\r\nhad a fixed principle; with the former, it was the religious sovereignty\r\nof the pope, as representative and depositary of the unity of the\r\nChristian church; with the others, it was the negation of this\r\nsovereignty and the revindication of the free regimen of the primitive\r\nChristian church.  To these fixed and peremptory principles the\r\ngovernment of Henry IV. had nothing similar to oppose; it spoke in the\r\nname of social interests, of the public peace, and of mutual toleration;\r\nall excellent reasons, but with merits consisting in their practical\r\nsoundness, not in their logical connection with the superior principle to\r\nwhich the sixteenth century had not yet attained.  It was all very well\r\nfor Henry IV. to maintain the cause and to have the support of the great\r\nmajority in France; but outside of this majority he was incessantly\r\nencountering and incessantly having to put down or to humor two parties,\r\nor rather factions, full of discontent and as irreconcilable with him as\r\namong themselves, for it was not peace and tolerance that they demanded\r\nof him, but victory and supremacy in the name of absolute right.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the scene; on one side a great majority of Catholics and\r\nProtestants favorable for different practical reasons to Henry IV.\r\nturned Catholic king; on the other, two minorities, one of stubborn\r\nCatholics of the League, the other of Protestants anxious for their creed\r\nand their liberty; both discontented and distrustful.  Such, after Henry\r\nIV.’s abjuration, was the striking feature in the condition of France and\r\nin the situation of her king.  This triple fact was constantly present to\r\nthe mind of Henry IV., and ruled his conduct during all his reign; all\r\nthe acts of his government are proof of that.\r\n\r\nHis first embarrassments arose from the faction of Catholics to the\r\nbackbone.  After his abjuration just as much as at his accession, the\r\nLeague continued to exist and to act against him.  The legate, Gaetani,\r\nmaintained that the bishops of France had no right, without the pope’s\r\napproval, to give an excommunicated prince absolution; he opposed the\r\nthree months’ truce concluded by Mayenne, and threatened to take his\r\ndeparture for Rome.  Mayenne, to appease him and detain him, renewed the\r\nalliance between the League and Spain, prevailed upon the princes and\r\nmarshals to renew also the oath of union, caused the states-general of\r\nthe League to vote the adoption of the Council of Trent, and, on\r\nproroguing them, August 8, 1593, received from them a promise to return\r\nat the expiration of the truce.  For the members of that assembly it was\r\nnot a burdensome engagement; independently of the compensation they had\r\nfrom their provinces, which was ten livres (thirty-six francs, sixty\r\ncentimes) a day during each session, they received from the King of Spain\r\na regular retainer, which raised it, for the five months from June to\r\nOctober, to seventy-two thousand one hundred and forty-four francs, which\r\nthey divided between themselves.  “It was presumed,” said Jehan\r\nl’Huillier, provost of tradesmen, to one of his colleagues who was\r\npressing him to claim this payment from the ambassador of Spain, “that\r\nthe money came from M. de Mayenne, not from foreigners; “but honest\r\npeople, such as Du Vair and Thielement, did not content themselves with\r\nthis presumption, and sent to the Hotel-Dieu, for maintenance of the\r\npoor, the share which was remitted to them.  [Poirson, _Histoire du Regne\r\nde Henry IV.,_ t. i.  p. 463.  Picot, _Histoire des Etats generaux,_\r\nt. iii.  p. 249.]\r\n\r\nThe states-general of the League did not appear again; their prorogation\r\nwas their death.  The year 1594, which came after them, was for Henry IV.\r\na year of home conquests, some pacific and due to the spontaneous\r\nmovement of the inhabitants, others obtained after resistance and\r\npurchased with gold.  The town of Lyons set the example of the first.  A\r\nrumor spread that the Spaniards were preparing an expedition against it;\r\nsome burgesses met to consult, and sent a private message to Alphonse\r\nd’Ornano, who was conducting the war for the king in Dauphiny, pressing\r\nhim to move forward, on a day appointed, to the faubourg de la\r\nGuillotiere.  A small force sent by Ornano arrived, accordingly, on the\r\n7th of February, about daybreak, at the foot of the bridge over the\r\nRhone, in the faubourg, and, after a stubborn resistance, dislodged the\r\noutpost on duty there.  At sound of the fighting, excitement broke out in\r\nthe town; and barricades were thrown up, amidst shouts of “Hurrah for\r\nFrench liberty!” without any mention of the king’s name.  The archbishop,\r\nPeter d’Espignac, a stanch Leaguer, tried to intimidate the burgesses,\r\nor at any rate to allay the excitement.  As he made no impression, he\r\nretired into his palace.  The people arrested the sheriffs and seized the\r\narsenal.  The king’s name resounded everywhere.  “The noise of the\r\ncheering was such,” says De Thou, “that there was no hearing the sound of\r\nthe bells.  Everybody assumed the white scarf with so much zeal that by\r\nevening there was not a scrap of white silk left at the tradesmen’s.\r\nTables were laid in the streets; the king’s arms were put up on the gates\r\nand in the public thoroughfares.”  Ornano marched in over the barricades;\r\nroyalist sheriffs were substituted for the Leaguer sheriffs, and hastened\r\nto take the oath of allegiance to the king, who had nothing to do but\r\nthank the Lyonnese for having been the first to come over to him without\r\nconstraint or any exigency, and who confirmed by an edict all their\r\nmunicipal liberties.  At the very moment when the Lyonnese were thus\r\nspringing to the side of their king, there set out from Lyons the first\r\nassassin who raised a hand against Henry IV., Peter Parriere, a poor\r\nboatman of the Loire, whom an unhappy passion for a girl in the household\r\nof Marguerite de Valois and the preachings of fanatics had urged on to\r\nthis hateful design.  Assassin we have called him, although there was not\r\non his part so much as an attempt at assassination; but he had, by his\r\nown admission, projected and made preparations for the crime, to the\r\nextent of talking it over with accomplices and sharpening the knife he\r\nhad purchased for its accomplishment.  Having been arrested at Melun and\r\ntaken to Paris, he was sentenced to capital punishment, and to all the\r\ntortures that ingenuity could add to it.  He owned to everything, whilst\r\ncursing those who had assured him that “if he died in the enterprise, his\r\nsoul, uplifted by angels, would float away to the bosom of God, where he\r\nwould enjoy eternal bliss.”  Moved by his torments and his repentance,\r\nthe judge who presided at his execution took upon himself to shorten it\r\nby having him strangled.  The judge was reported to the king for this\r\nindulgence.  Henry praised him for it, adding that he would have pardoned\r\nthe criminal if he had been brought before him.  Thus commenced, at the\r\nopening of his reign, the series of attempts to which he was destined to\r\nsuccumb, after seventeen years of good, able, generous, and mild\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn Normandy, at Rouen, the royalist success was neither so easy nor so\r\ndisinterested as it had been at Lyons.  Andrew de Brancas, Lord of\r\nVillars, an able man and valiant soldier, was its governor; he had served\r\nthe League with zeal and determination; nevertheless, “from the month of\r\nAugust, 1593, immediately after the king’s conversion, he had shown a\r\ndisposition to become his servant, and to incline thereto all those whom\r\nhe had in his power.”  [_Histoire du Parlement de Normandi,_ by M.\r\nFloquet, t. iii.  pp. 611-617.] Henry IV. commissioned Rosny to negotiate\r\nwith him; and Rosny went into Normandy, to Louviers first and then to\r\nRouen itself.  The negotiation seemed to be progressing favorably, but a\r\ndistrustful whim in regard to Villars, and the lofty pretensions he put\r\nforward, made Rosny hang back for a while, and tell the whole story to\r\nthe king, at the same time asking for his instructions.  Henry replied,--\r\n\r\n“My friend, you are an ass to employ so much delay and import so many\r\ndifficulties and manoeuvres into a business the conclusion of which is of\r\nso great importance to me for the establishment of my authority and the\r\nrelief of my people.  Do you no longer remember the counsels you have so\r\nmany times given to me, whilst setting before me as an example that given\r\nby a certain Duke of Milan to King Louis XI., at the time of the war\r\ncalled that of the Common Weal?  It was to split up by considerations of\r\nprivate interest all those who were leagued against him on general\r\npretexts.  That is what I desire to attempt now, far preferring that it\r\nshould cost twice as much to treat separately with each individual as it\r\nwould to arrive at the same results by means of a general treaty\r\nconcluded with a single leader, who, in that way, would be enabled to\r\nkeep up still an organized party within my dominions.  You know plenty of\r\nfolks who wanted to persuade me to that.  Wherefore, do not any longer\r\nwaste your time in doing either so much of the respectful towards those\r\nwhom you wot of, and whom we will find other means of contenting, or of\r\nthe economical by sticking at money.  We will pay everything with the\r\nvery things given up to us, the which, if they had to be taken by force,\r\nwould cost us ten times as much.  Seeing, then, that I put entire trust\r\nin you and love you as a good servant, do not hesitate any longer to make\r\nabsolute and bold use of your power, which I further authorize by this\r\nletter, so far as there may be further need for it, and settle as soon as\r\npossible with M. de Villars.  But secure matters so well that there may\r\nbe no possibility of a slip, and send me news thereof promptly, for I\r\nshall be in constant doubt and impatience until I receive it.  And then,\r\nwhen I am peaceably king, we will employ the excellent manoeuvres of\r\nwhich you have said so much to me; and you may rest assured that I will\r\nspare no travail and fear no peril in order to raise my glory and my\r\nkingdom to the height of splendor.  Adieu, my friend.  Senlis, this 18th\r\nday of March, 1594.”\r\n\r\nAmongst the pretensions made by Villars there was one which could not be\r\nsatisfied without the consent of a man still more considerable than he,\r\nand one with whom Henry IV. was obliged to settle--Biron.  Villars had\r\nreceived from Mayenne the title and office of admiral of France, and he\r\nwished, at any price, to retain them on passing over to the king’s\r\nservice.  Now Henry IV. had already given this office to Biron, who had\r\nno idea of allowing himself to be stripped of it.  It was all very fine\r\nto offer him in exchange the baton of a marshal of France, but he would\r\nnot be satisfied with it. “It was necessary,” says M. Floquet [_Histoire\r\ndu Parlement de Normandie,_ t. iii.  pp. 613-616], “for the king’s sister\r\n(Princess Catherine) to intervene.  At last, a promise of one hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand crowns won Biron over, though against the grain.”  But he\r\nwanted solid securities.  Attention was then turned to the Parliament of\r\nCaen, always so ready to do anything and sacrifice anything.  Saldaigne\r\nd’Incarville, comptroller-general of finance, having been despatched to\r\nCaen, went straight to the palace and reported to the Parliament the\r\nproposals and conditions of Villers and Biron.  “The king,” said he, “not\r\nhaving been able to bring Rouen to reason by process of arms, and being\r\nimpatient to put some end to these miseries, wishes now to try gentle\r\nprocesses, and treat with those whom he has not yet been able to subdue;\r\nbut co-operation on the part of the sovereign bodies of the provinces is\r\nnecessary.”  “To that which is for the good of our service is added your\r\nprivate interest,” wrote Henry IV. to the Parliament of Caen; and his\r\nmessenger D’Incarville added, “I have left matters at Rouen so arranged\r\nas to make me hope that before a fortnight is over you will be free to\r\nreturn thither and enter your homes once more.”  At the first mention of\r\npeace and the prospect of a reconciliation between the royalist\r\nParliament of Caen and the leaguer Parliament of Rouen, the Parliament,\r\nthe exchequer-chamber, and the court of taxation, agreed to a fresh\r\nsacrifice and a last effort.  The four presidents of the Parliament lost\r\nno time in signing together, and each for all, an engagement to guarantee\r\nthe hundred and twenty thousand crowns promised to Biron.  .  .  .  The\r\nmembers of the body bound themselves all together to guarantee the four\r\npresidents, in their turn, in respect of the engagement they were\r\ncontracting, and a letter was addressed on the spot to Henry IV., “to\r\nthank the monarch for his good will and affection, and the honor he was\r\ndoing the members of his Parliament of Normandy, by making them\r\nparticipators in the means and overtures adopted for arriving at the\r\nreduction of the town of Rouen.”  [M. Floquet, _Histoire du Parlement de\r\nNormandi,_ t. iii.  pp. 613-616.]\r\n\r\nHere is the information afforded, as regards the capitulation of Villars\r\nto Henry IV., by the statement drawn up by Sully himself, of “the amount\r\nof all debts on account of all the treaties made for the reduction of\r\ndistricts, towns, places, and persons to obedience unto the king, in\r\norder to the pacification of the realm.”\r\n\r\n“To M. Villars, for himself, his brother, Chevalier d’Oise, the towns of\r\nRouen and Havre and other places, as well as for compensation which had\r\nto be made to MM. de Montpensier, Marshal de Biron, Chancellor de\r\nChiverny, and other persons included in his treaty .  .  .  three\r\nmillions four hundred and forty-seven thousand eight hundred livres.”\r\n [Poirson, _Histoire du Regne de Henry IV.,_ t. i.  p. 667.]\r\n\r\nThese details have been entered into without hesitation because it is\r\nimportant to clearly understand by what means, by what assiduous efforts,\r\nand at what price Henry IV. managed to win back pacifically many\r\nprovinces of his kingdom, rally to his government many leaders of note,\r\nand finally to confer upon France that territorial and political unity\r\nwhich she lacked under the feudal regimen, and which, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the religious wars all but put it beyond her power to acquire.\r\nTo the two instances just cited of royalist reconciliation--Lyons and the\r\nspontaneous example set by her population, and Rouen and the dearly\r\npurchased capitulation of her governor Villars--must be added a third, of\r\na different sort.  Nicholas de Neufville, Lord of Villeroi, after having\r\nserved Charles IX. and Henry III., had become, through attachment to the\r\nCatholic cause, a member of the League, and one of the Duke of Mayenne’s\r\nconfidants.  When Henry IV. was King of France, and Catholic king,\r\nVilleroi tried to serve his cause with Mayenne, and induce Mayenne to be\r\nreconciled with him.  Meeting with no success, he made up his mind to\r\nseparate from the League, and go over to the king’s service. He could do\r\nso without treachery or shame; even as a Leaguer and a servant of\r\nMayenne’s he had always been opposed to Spain, and devoted to a French,\r\nbut, at the same time, a faithfully Catholic policy.  He imported into\r\nthe service of Henry IV. the same sentiments and the same bearing; he was\r\nstill a zealous Catholic, and a partisan, for king and country’s sake, of\r\nalliance with Catholic powers.  He was a man of wits, experience, and\r\nresource, who knew Europe well and had some influence at the court of\r\nRome.  Henry IV. saw at once the advantage to be gained from him, and, in\r\nspite of the Protestants’ complaints, and his sister Princess Catherine’s\r\nprayers, made him, on the 25th of September, 1594, secretary of state for\r\nforeign affairs.  This acquisition did not cost him so dear as that of\r\nVillars: still we read in the statement of sums paid by Henry IV. for\r\nthis sort of conquest, “Furthermore, to M. de Villeroi, for himself, his\r\nson, the town of Pontoise, and other individuals, according to their\r\ntreaty, four hundred and seventy-six thousand five hundred and\r\nninety-four livres.”  It is quite true that this statement was drawn up\r\nby Sully, the unwavering supporter of Protestant alliances in Europe,\r\nand, as such, Villeroi’s opponent in the council of Henry IV.; but the\r\nother contemporary documents confirm Sully’s assertion.  Villeroi was\r\na faithful servant to Henry, who well repaid him by stanchness in\r\nsupporting him against the repeated attacks of violent Reformers.  In\r\n1594, when he became minister of foreign affairs, the following verse\r\nwas in vogue at the Louvre:--\r\n\r\n               “The king could never beat the League;\r\n               ‘Twas Villeroi who did the thing;\r\n               So well he managed his intrigue,\r\n               That now the League hath got the king.”\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain, however, that Henry IV. was never of the opinion\r\nexpressed in that verse; for, ten years later, in 1604, Villeroi having\r\nfound himself much compromised by the treachery of a chief clerk in his\r\ndepartment, who had given up to the Spanish government some important\r\ndespatches, the king, though very vexed at this mishap, “the consequences\r\nof which rankled in his heart far more than he allowed to appear openly,\r\nnevertheless continued to look most kindly on Villeroi, taking the\r\ntrouble to call upon him, to console and comfort him under this\r\nannoyance, and not showing him a suspicion of mistrust because of what\r\nhad happened, any more than formerly; nay, even less.”  [_Journal de\r\nL’Estoile,_ t. iii.  pp. 85-441.] Never had prince a better or nobler way\r\nof employing confidence in his proceedings with his servants, old or new,\r\nat the same time that he made clear-sighted and proper distinctions\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nHenry IV., with his mind full of his new character as a Catholic king,\r\nperceived the necessity of getting the pope to confirm the absolution\r\nwhich had been given him, at the time of his conversion, by the French\r\nbishops.  It was the condition of his credit amongst the numerous\r\nCatholic population who were inclined to rally to him, but required to\r\nknow that he was at peace with the head of their church.  He began by\r\nsending to Rome non-official agents, instructed to quietly sound the\r\npope, amongst others Arnold d’Ossat, a learned professor in the\r\nUniversity of Paris, who became, at a later period, the celebrated\r\ncardinal and diplomat of that name.  Clement VIII.  [Hippolytus\r\nAldobrandini] was a clever man, moderate and prudent to the verge of\r\ntimidity, and, one who was disinclined to take decisive steps as to\r\ndifficult questions or positions until after they had been decided by\r\nevents.  He refused to have any communication with him whom he still\r\ncalled the Prince of Bearn, and only received the agents of Henry IV.\r\nprivately in his closet.  But whilst he was personally severe and\r\nexacting in his behavior to then, he had a hint given them by one of his\r\nconfidants not to allow themselves to be rebuffed by any obstacle, for\r\nthe pope would, sooner or later, welcome back the lost child who returned\r\nto him.  At this report, and by the advice of the Grand Duke of Tuscany,\r\nFerdinand de’ Medici, Henry IV. determined to send a solemn embassy to\r\nRome, and to put it under the charge of a prince of Italian origin, Peter\r\ndi Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers.  But either through the pope’s stubborn\r\nresolve or the ambassador’s somewhat impatient temper, devoted as he was,\r\nhowever, to the Holy See, the embassy had no success.  The Duke of Nevers\r\ncould not obtain an official reception as ambassador of the King of\r\nFrance.  It was in vain that he had five confidential audiences of the\r\npope; in vain that he represented energetically to him all the progress\r\nHenry IV. had already made, all the chances he had of definitive success,\r\nall the perils to which the papacy exposed itself by rejecting his\r\nadvances; Clement VIII. persisted in his determination.  Philip II. and\r\nMayenne still reigned in his ideas, and he dismissed the Duke of Nevers\r\non the 13th of January, 1594, declaring once more that he refused to the\r\nNavarrese absolution at the inner bar of conscience, absolution at the\r\nouter bar, and confirmation in his kingship.\r\n\r\nHenry IV. did not put himself out, did not give himself the pleasure of\r\ntestifying to Rome his discontent; he saw that he had not as yet\r\nsufficiently succeeded--sufficiently vanquished his enemies, or won to\r\nhimself his kingdom with sufficient completeness and definitiveness--to\r\nmake the pope feel bound to recognize and sanction his triumph.  He set\r\nhimself once more to work to grow still greater in France, and force the\r\ngates of Rome without its being possible to reproach him with violence or\r\nill temper.\r\n\r\nHe had been absolved and crowned at St.  Denis by the bishops of France;\r\nhe had not been anointed at Rheims, according to the religious traditions\r\nof the French monarchy.  At Rheims he could not be; for it was still in\r\nthe power of the League.  Researches were made, to discover whether the\r\nceremony of anointment might take place elsewhere; numerous instances\r\nwere found, and in the case of famous kings: Pepin the Short had been\r\nanointed first of all at Mayence, Charlemagne and Louis the Debonnair at\r\nRome, Charles the Bald at Mayence, several emperors at Aix-la-Chapelle\r\nand at Cologne.  The question of the holy phial (ampoule) was also\r\ndiscussed; and it was proved that on several occasions other oils, held\r\nto be of miraculous origin, had been employed instead.  These\r\ndifficulties thus removed, the anointment of Henry IV. took place at\r\nChartres on the 27th of February, 1594; the Bishop of Chartres, Nicholas\r\nde Thou, officiated, and drew up a detailed account of all the ceremonies\r\nand all the rejoicings; thirteen medals, each weighing fifteen gold\r\ncrowns, were struck, according to custom; they bore the king’s image, and\r\nfor legend, _Invia virtuti nulla est via_ (To manly worth no road is\r\ninaccessible).  Henry IV., on his knees before the grand altar, took the\r\nusual oath, the form of which was presented to him by Chancellor de\r\nChiverny.  With the exception of local accessories, which were\r\nacknowledged to be impossible and unnecessary, there was nothing wanting\r\nto this religious hallowing of his kingship.\r\n\r\nBut one other thing, more important than the anointment at Chartres, was\r\nwanting.  He did not possess the capital of his kingdom the League were\r\nstill masters of Paris.  Uneasy masters of their situation; but not so\r\nuneasy, however, as they ought to have been.  The great leaders of the\r\nparty, the Duke of Mayenne, his mother the Duchess of Nemours, his sister\r\nthe Duchess of Montpensier, and the Duke of Feria, Spanish ambassador,\r\nwere within its walls, a prey to alarm and discouragement.  “At\r\nbreakfast,” said the Duchess of Montpensier, “they regale us with the\r\nsurrender of a hamlet, at dinner of a town, at supper of a whole\r\nprovince.”  The Duchess of Nemours, who desired peace, exerted herself to\r\nconvince her son of all their danger.  “Set your affairs in order,” she\r\nsaid;--if you do not begin to make your arrangements with the king before\r\nleaving Paris, you will lose this capital.  I know that projects are\r\nalready afoot for giving it up, and that those who can do it, and in whom\r\nyou have most confidence, are accomplices and even authors of the plot.”\r\n Mayenne himself did not hide from his confidants the gravity of the\r\nmischief and his own disquietude.  “Not a day,” he wrote on the 4th of\r\nFebruary, 1594, to the Marquis of Montpezat, “but brings some trouble\r\nbecause of the people’s yearning for repose, and of the weakness which is\r\napparent on our side.  I stem and stop this forment with as much courage\r\nas I can; but the present mischief is overwhelming; the King of Navarre\r\nwill in a few days have an army of twenty thousand men, French as well as\r\nforeigners.  What will become of us, if we have not wherewithal not only\r\nto oppose him, but to make him lose the campaign?  I can tell you of a\r\nverity that, save for my presence, Paris would have already been lost\r\nbecause of the great factions there are in it, which I take all the pains\r\nin the world to disperse and break up, and also because of the small aid,\r\nor rather the gainsaying, I meet with from the ministers of the King of\r\nSpain.”  Mayenne tried to restore amongst the Leaguers both zeal and\r\ndiscipline; he convoked on the 2d of March, a meeting of all that\r\nremained of the faction of the Sixteen; he calculated upon the presence\r\nof some twelve hundred; scarcely three hundred came; he had an harangue\r\ndelivered to them by the Rev. John Boucher, charged them to be faithful\r\nto the old spirit of the League, promised them that he would himself be\r\nfaithful even to death, and exhorted them to be obedient in everything to\r\nBrissac, whom he had just appointed governor of the city, and to the\r\nprovost of tradesmen.  On announcing to them his imminent departure for\r\nSoissons, to meet some auxiliary troops which were to be sent to him by\r\nthe King of Spain, “I leave to you,” he said, “what is dearest to me in\r\nthe world--my wife, my children, my mother, and my sister.”  But when he\r\ndid set out, four days afterwards, on the 6th of March, 1594, he took\r\naway his wife and his children; his mother had already warned him that\r\nBrissac was communicating secretly, by means of his cousin, Sieur de\r\nRochepot, with the royalists, and that the provost of tradesmen,\r\nL’Huillier, and three of the four sheriffs were agreed to bring the city\r\nback to obedience to the king.  When the Sixteen and their adherents saw\r\nMayenne departing with his wife and children, great were their alarm and\r\nwrath.  A large band, with the incumbent of St. Cosmo (Hamilton) at their\r\nhead, rushed about the streets in arms, saying, “Look to your city; the\r\npolicists are brewing a terrible business for it.”  Others, more violent,\r\ncried, “To arms!  Down upon the policists!  Begin!  Let us make an end of\r\nit!”  The policists, that is, the burgesses inclined to peace, repaired\r\non their side to the provost of tradesmen to ask for his authority to\r\nassemble at the Palace or the Hotel de Ville, and to provide for security\r\nin case of any public calamity.  The provost tried to elude their\r\nentreaties by pleading that the Duke of Mayenne would think ill of their\r\nassembling.  “Then you are not the tradesmen’s but M. de Mayenne’s\r\nprovost?” said one of them.  “I am no Spaniard,” answered the provost;\r\n“no more is M. de Mayenne; I am anxious to reconcile you to the Sixteen.”\r\n “We are honest folks, not branded and defamed like the Sixteen; we will\r\nhave no reconciliation with the wretches.”  The Parliament grew excited,\r\nand exclaimed against the insolence and the menaces of the Sixteen.  “We\r\nmust give place to these sedition-mongers, or put them down.”  A decree,\r\npublished by sound of trumpet on the 14th of March, 1594, throughout the\r\nwhole city, prohibited the Sixteen and their partisans from assembling on\r\npain of death.  That same day, Count de Brissac, governor of Paris, had\r\nan interview at the abbey of St. Anthony, with his brother-in-law,\r\nFrancis d’Epinay, Lord of St. Luc, Henry IV.’s grand-master of the\r\nordnance; they had disputes touching private interests, which they\r\nwished, they said, to put right; and on this pretext advocates had\r\nappeared at their interview.  They spent three hours in personal\r\nconference, their minds being directed solely to the means of putting the\r\nking into possession of Paris.  They separated in apparent dudgeon.\r\nBrissac went to call upon the legate Gaetani, and begged him to excuse\r\nthe error he had committed in communicating with a heretic; his interest\r\nin the private affairs in question was too great, he said, for him to\r\nneglect it.  The legate excused him graciously, whilst praising him for\r\nhis modest conduct, and related the incident to the Duke of Feria, the\r\nSpanish ambassador.  “He is a good fellow, M. de Brissac,” said the\r\nambassador; “I have always found him so; you have only to employ the\r\nJesuits to make him do all you please.  He takes little notice,\r\notherwise, of affairs; one day, when we were holding council in here,\r\nwhilst we were deliberating, he was amusing himself by catching flies.”\r\n For four days the population of Paris was occupied with a solemn\r\nprocession in honor of St. Genevieve, in which the Parliament and all the\r\nmunicipal authorities took part.  Brissac had agreed with his\r\nbrother-in-law D’Epinay that he would let the king in on the 22d of\r\nMarch, and he had arranged, in concert with the provost of tradesmen, two\r\nsheriffs, and several district captains, the course of procedure.  On the\r\n21st of March, in the evening, some Leaguers paid him a visit, and spoke\r\nto him warmly about the rumors current on the subject in the city,\r\ncalling upon him to look to it.  “I have received the same notice,” said\r\nBrissac, coolly; “and I have given all the necessary orders.  Leave me to\r\nact, and keep you quiet, so as not to wake up those who will have to be\r\nsecured.  To-morrow morning you will see a fine to-do and the policists\r\nmuch surprised.”  During all the first part of the night between the 21st\r\nand 22d of March, Brissac went his rounds of the city and the guards he\r\nhad posted, “with an appearance of great care and solicitude.”  He had\r\nsome trouble to get rid of certain Spanish officers, “whom the Duke of\r\nFeria had sent him to keep him company in his rounds, with orders to\r\nthrow themselves upon him and kill him at the first suspicious movement;\r\nbut they saw nothing to confirm their suspicions, and at two A. M.,\r\nBrissac brought them back much fatigued to the duke’s, where he left\r\nthem.”  Henry IV., having started on the 21st of March from Senlis, where\r\nhe had mustered his troops, and arrived about midnight at St. Denis,\r\nimmediately began his march to Paris.  The night was dark and stormy;\r\nthunder rumbled; rain fell heavily; the king was a little behind time.\r\nAt three A. M.. the policists inside Paris had taken arms and repaired to\r\nthe posts that had been assigned to them.  Brissac had placed a guard\r\nclose to the quarters of the Spanish ambassador, and ordered the men to\r\nfire on any who attempted to leave.  He had then gone in person, with\r\nL’Huillier, the provost of tradesmen, to the New Gate, which he had\r\ncaused to be unlocked and guarded.  Sheriff Langlois had done the same at\r\nthe gate of St. Denis.  On the 22d of March, at four A. M., the king had\r\nnot yet appeared before the ramparts, nor any one for him.  Langlois\r\nissued from the gate, went some little distance to look out, and came in\r\nagain, more and more impatient.  At last, between four and five o’clock,\r\na detachment of the royal troops, commanded by Vitry, appeared before the\r\ngate of St. Denis, which was instantly opened.  Brissac’s brother-in-law,\r\nSt. Luc, arrived about the same time at the New Gate, with a considerable\r\nforce.  The king’s troops entered Paris.  They occupied the different\r\ndistricts, and met with no show of resistance but at the quay of L’Ecole,\r\nwhere an outpost of lanzknechts tried to stop them; but they were cut in\r\npieces or hurled into the river.  Between five and six o’clock Henry IV.,\r\nat the head of the last division, crossed the drawbridge of the New Gate.\r\nBrissac, Provost L’Huillier, the sheriffs, and several companies of\r\nburgesses advanced to meet him.  The king embraced Brissac, throwing his\r\nown white scarf round his neck, and addressing him as “Marshal.”  “Render\r\nunto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s,” said Brissac, as he called\r\nupon the provost of tradesmen to present to the king the keys of the\r\ncity.  “Yes,” said L’Huillier, “render them, not sell them.”  The king\r\nwent forward with his train, going along Rue St. Honore to the market of\r\nthe Innocents and the bridge of Notre-Dame; the crowd increased at every\r\nstep.  “Let them come near,” said Henry; “they hunger to see a king.”  At\r\nevery step, too, at sight of the smallest incident, the character of\r\nHenry, his natural thoughtful and lovable kindliness, shone forth.  He\r\nasked if his entry had met with resistance anywhere; and he was told that\r\nabout fifty lanzknechts had been killed at the quay of L’Ecole.  “I would\r\nwillingly give fifty thousand crowns,” said he, “to be able to say that I\r\ntook Paris without costing the life of one single man.”  As he marched\r\nalong the Rue St. Honore, he saw a soldier taking some bread by force\r\nfrom a baker’s; he rushed at him, and would have struck him with his\r\nsword.  As he passed in front of the Innocents, he saw at a window a man\r\nwho was looking at him, and pointedly keeping his hat on; the man\r\nperceived that the king’ observed him, and withdrew, shutting down the\r\nwindow.  Henry said, “Let nobody enter this house to vex or molest any\r\none in it.”  He arrived in front of Notre-Dame, followed by five or six\r\nhundred men-at-arms, who trailed their pikes “in token of a victory that\r\nwas voluntary on the people’s part,” it was said.  There was no uproar,\r\nor any hostile movement, save on the left bank of the Seine, in the\r\nUniversity quarter, where the Sixteen attempted to assemble their\r\npartisans round the gate of St. Jacques; but they were promptly dispersed\r\nby the people as well as by the royal troops.  On leaving Notre-Dame,\r\nHenry repaired to the Louvre, where he installed royalty once more.\r\nAt ten o’clock he was master of the whole city; the districts of\r\nSt. Martin, of the Temple, and St. Anthony alone remained still in the\r\npower of three thousand Spanish soldiers under the orders of their\r\nleaders, the Duke of Feria and Don Diego d’Ibarra.  Nothing would have\r\nbeen easier for Henry than to have had them driven out by his own troops\r\nand the people of Paris, who wanted to finish the day’s work by\r\nexterminating the foreigners; but he was too judicious and too\r\nfar-sighted to embitter the general animosity by pushing his victory\r\nbeyond what was necessary.  He sent word to the Spaniards that they must\r\nnot move from their quarters and must leave Paris during the day, at the\r\nsame time promising not to bear arms any more against him, in France.\r\nThey eagerly accepted these conditions.  At three o’clock in the\r\nafternoon, ambassador, officers, and soldiers all evacuated Paris, and\r\nset out for the Low Countries.  The king, posted at a window over the\r\ngate of St. Denis, witnessed their departure.  They, as they passed,\r\nsaluted him respectfully; and he returned their salute, saying, “Go,\r\ngentlemen, and commend me to your master; but return no more.”\r\n\r\nAfter his conversion to Catholicism, the capture of Paris was the most\r\ndecisive of the issues which made Henry IV. really King of France.  The\r\nsubmission of Rouen followed almost immediately upon that of Paris; and\r\nthe year 1594 brought Henry a series of successes, military and civil,\r\nwhich changed very much to his advantage the position of the kingship as\r\nwell as the general condition of the kingdom.  In Normandy, in Picardy,\r\nin Champagne, in Anjou, in Poitou, in Brittany, in Orleanness, in\r\nAuvergne, a multitude of important towns, Havre, Honfleur, Abbeville,\r\nAmiens, Peronue, Montdidier, Poitiers, Orleans, Rheims, Chateau-Thierry,\r\nBeauvais, Sens, Riom, Morlaix, Laval, Laon, returned to the king’s\r\nauthority, some after sieges and others by pacific and personal\r\narrangement, more or less burdensome for the public treasury, but very\r\neffective in promoting the unity of the nation and of the monarchy.  In\r\nthe table drawn up by Sully of expenses under that head, he estimated\r\nthem at thirty-two millions, one hundred and forty-two thousand, nine\r\nhundred and eighty-one livres, equivalent at the present day, says M.\r\nPoirson, to one hundred and eighteen millions of francs.  The rendition\r\nof Paris, “on account of M. de Brissac, the city itself and other\r\nindividuals employed on his treaty,” figures in this sum total at one\r\nmillion, six hundred and forty-five thousand, four hundred livres.\r\nTerritorial acquisitions were not the only political conquests of this\r\nepoch; some of the great institutions which had been disjointed by the\r\nreligious wars, for instance, the Parliaments of Paris and Normandy,\r\nrecovered their unity and resumed their efficacy to the advantage of\r\norder, of the monarchy, and of national independence; their decrees\r\nagainst the League contributed powerfully to its downfall.  Henry IV.\r\ndid his share in other ways besides warfare; he excelled in the art of\r\nwinning over or embarrassing his vanquished foes.  After the submission\r\nof Paris, the two princesses of the house of Lorraine who had remained\r\nthere, the Duchesses of Nemours and of Montpensier, one the mother and\r\nthe other the sister of the Duke of Mayenne, were preparing to go and\r\nrender homage to the conqueror; Henry anticipated them, and paid them the\r\nfirst visit.  As he was passing through a room where hung a portrait of\r\nHenry de Guise, he halted and saluted it very courteously.  The Duchess\r\nof Montpensier, who had so often execrated him, did not hesitate to\r\nexpress her regret that “her brother Mayenne had not been there to let\r\ndown for him the drawbridge of the gate by which he had entered Paris.”\r\n “Ventre-saint-gris,” said the king, “he might have made me wait a long\r\nwhile; I should not have arrived so early.”  He knew that the Duchess of\r\nNemours had desired peace, and when she allowed some signs of vexation to\r\npeep out at her not having been able to bring her sons and grandsons to\r\nthat determination, “Madame,” said he, a there is still time if they\r\nplease.”  At the close of 1594, he imported disorganization into the\r\nhousehold of Lorraine by offering the government of Provence to the young\r\nDuke Charles of Guise, son of the Balafre; who eagerly accepted it; and\r\nhe from that moment paved the way, by the agency of President Jeannin,\r\nfor his reconciliation with Mayenne, which he brought to accomplishment\r\nat the end of 1595.\r\n\r\nThe close of this happy and glorious year was at hand.  On the 27th of\r\nSeptember, between six and seven P.M., a deplorable incident occurred,\r\nfor the second time, to call Henry IV.’s attention to the weak side of\r\nhis position.  He was just back from Picardy, and holding a\r\ncourt-reception at Schomberg House, at the back of the Louvre.  John\r\nChastel, a young man of nineteen, son of a cloth-merchant in the city,\r\nslipped in among the visitors, managed to approach the king, and dealt\r\nhim a blow with a knife just as he was stooping to raise and embrace\r\nFrancis de la Grange, Sieur de Montigny, who was kneeling before him.\r\nThe blow, aimed at the king’s throat, merely slit his upper lip and broke\r\na tooth.  “I am wounded!” said the king.  John Chastel, having dropped\r\nhis knife, had remained on the spot, motionless and confused.  Montigny,\r\naccording to some, but, according to others, the Count of Soissons, who\r\nhappened to be near him, laid hands upon him, saying, “Here is the\r\nassassin, either he or I.”  Henry IV., always prone to pass things over,\r\npooh-poohed the suspicion, and was just giving orders to let the young\r\nman go, when the knife, discovered on the ground close to Chastel, became\r\npositive evidence.  Chastel was questioned, searched, and then handed,\r\nover to the grand provost of the household, who had him conveyed to\r\nprison at For-l’Eveque.  He first of all denied, but afterwards admitted\r\nhis deed, regretting that he had missed his aim, and saying he was ready\r\nto try again for his own salvation’s sake and that of religion.  He\r\ndeclared that he had been brought up amongst the Jesuits in Rue St.\r\nJacques, and he gave long details as to the education he had received\r\nthere and the maxims he had heard there.  The rumor of his crime and of\r\nthe revelations he had made spread immediately over Paris and caused\r\npassionate excitement.  The people filled the churches and rendered\r\nthanks to God for having preserved the king.  The burgesses took up arms\r\nand mustered at their guard-posts.  The mob bore down on the college of\r\nJesuits in Rue St. Jacques with threats of violence.  The king and the\r\nParliament sent a force thither; Brizard, councillor in the high chamber,\r\ncaptain of the district, had the fathers removed, and put them in\r\nsecurity in his own house.  The inquiry was prosecuted deliberately and\r\ntemperately.  It brought out that John Chastel had often heard repeated\r\nat his college “that it was allowable to kill kings, even the king\r\nregnant, when they were not in the church or approved of by the pope.”\r\n The accused formally maintained this maxim, which was found written out\r\nand dilated upon under his own hand in a note-book seized at his\r\nfather’s.  “Was it necessary, pray,” said Henry IV., laughing, “that the\r\nJesuits should be convicted by my mouth?”  John Chastel was sentenced to\r\nthe most cruel punishment; and he underwent it on the 20th of December,\r\n1594, by torch-light, before the principal entrance of Notre-Dame,\r\nwithout showing any symptom of regret.  His mother and his sisters were\r\nset at liberty.  His father, an old Leaguer, had been cognizant of his\r\nproject, and had dissuaded him from it, but without doing anything to\r\nhinder it; he was banished from the kingdom for nine years, and from\r\nParis forever.  His house was razed to the ground; and on the site was\r\nset up a pyramid with the decree of the Parliament inscribed upon it.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings did not stop there.  At the beginning of this same year,\r\nand on petition from the University of Paris, the Parliament had\r\ncommenced a general prosecution of the order of Jesuits, its maxims,\r\ntendencies, and influence.  Formal discussions had taken place; the\r\nprosecution and the defence had been conducted with eloquence, and a\r\ndecree of the court had ordained that judgment should be deferred.\r\nSeveral of the most respected functionaries, notably President Augustin\r\nde Thou, had pronounced against this decree, considering the question so\r\ngrave and so urgent that the Parliament should make it their duty to\r\ndecide upon the point at issue.  When sentence had to be pronounced upon\r\nJohn Chastel, President de Thou took the opportunity of saying, “When I\r\nlately gave my opinion in the matter of the University and the Jesuits, I\r\nnever hoped, at my age and with my infirmities, that I should live long\r\nenough to take part in the judgment we are about to pass to-day.  It was\r\nthat which led me, in the indignation caused me by the course at that\r\ntime adopted, to lay down an opinion to which I to-day recur with much\r\njoy.  God be praised for having brought about an occasion whereon we have\r\nnothing to do but felicitate ourselves for that the enterprise which our\r\nfoes did meditate against the state and the life of the king hath been\r\nwithout success, and which proves clearly at the same time how much the\r\nthen opinion of certain honest men was wiser than that of persons who,\r\nfrom a miserable policy, were in favor of deferment!”  The court,\r\nanimated by the same sentiments as President do Thou, “declared the\r\nmaxims maintained in the Jesuits’ name to be rash, seditious, contrary to\r\nthe word of God, savoring of heresy and condemned by the holy canons; it\r\nexpressly forbade them to be taught publicly or privately, on pain, in\r\ncase of contraveners, of being treated as guilty of treason against God\r\nand man.  It decreed, further, that the priests of the college in Rue St.\r\nJacques, their pupils, and, generally, all members of that society,\r\nshould leave Paris and all the towns in which they had colleges three\r\ndays after this decree had been made known to them, and the kingdom\r\nwithin a fortnight, as corrupters of youth, disturbers of the public\r\npeace, and enemies of the king and of the state.  In default of obedience\r\non their part, their property, real and personal, should be confiscated\r\nand employed for pious purposes.  The court, besides, prohibited all\r\nsubjects of the king from sending their children as students to any\r\nJesuits out of the kingdom, on pain of being declared enemies of the\r\nstate.”  This decree was issued on the 29th of December, 1594.  And as if\r\nto leave no doubt about the sense and bearing of this legislation, it was\r\nimmediately applied in the case of a Jesuit father, John Guignard, a\r\nnative of Chartres; his papers were examined, and there were found in his\r\nhandwriting many propositions and provocatives of sedition, such as,\r\n“That a great mistake had been made at the St. Bartholomew in not having\r\nopened the basilic vein, that is, in not having murdered Henry IV. and\r\nthe Prince of Conde, who were of the blood royal;  2. That the crown\r\nmight have been, and ought to have been, transferred to a family other\r\nthan that of the Bourbons;  3. That the Bearnese, in spite of his\r\npretended conversion, ought to consider himself only too lucky if it were\r\nconsidered sufficient to shave his head and shut him up in a convent to\r\ndo penance there; that if the crown could not betaken from him without\r\nwar, then war must be made on him; and that if the state of things did\r\nnot admit of making war on him, he ought to be got rid of at any price\r\nand in any way whatsoever.”  For having, not published, but thought and\r\nwith his own hand written out all this, and probably taught it to his\r\npupils, Father Guignard was obliged to retract, and was afterwards hanged\r\nin the Place de Greve on the 7th of January, 1595.\r\n\r\nThe task of honest men and of right minds is greater and more difficult\r\nin our day than it was in the sixteenth century, for we have to reconcile\r\nthe laws and the requirements of moral and social order with far broader\r\nprinciples and sentiments, as regards right and liberty, than were those\r\nof President Augustin de Thou and the worthy functionaries of his time.\r\n\r\nIt was one of Henry IV.’s conspicuous qualities that no event, auspicious\r\nor inauspicious, affected the correctness of his judgment, and that he\r\nwas just as much a stranger to illusion or intoxication in the hour of\r\ngood fortune as to discouragement in the hour of ill.  He had sense\r\nenough to see, in any case, things as they really were, and to estimate\r\nat the proper value the strength they brought or the obstacles they\r\nformed to his government.  He saw at a glance all the importance there\r\nwas for him in the submission of Paris, and what change in his conduct\r\nwas required by that in his position.  Certain local successes of the\r\nSpaniards at some points in his kingdom, the efforts of Mayenne to\r\nresuscitate the dying League, and John Chastel’s attempt at assassination\r\ndid not for a moment interfere with his confidence in his progress, or\r\ncause him to hesitate as to the new bearing he had to assume.  He wrote\r\non the 17th of December, 1594, to the estates of Artois and Hainault,\r\n“I have hitherto lacked neither the courage nor the power to repel the\r\ninsults offered me, and to send recoiling upon the head of the King of\r\nSpain and his subjects the evils of which he was the author.  But just as\r\nwere the grounds I had for declaring war against him, motives more\r\npowerful and concerning the interests of all Christendom restrained me.\r\nAt the present time, when the principal leaders of the factious have\r\nreturned to their duty and submitted to my laws, Philip still continues\r\nhis intrigues to foster troubles in the very heart of my kingdom.  After\r\nmaturely reflecting, I have decided that it is time for me to act.\r\nNevertheless, as I cannot forget the friendship my ancestors always felt\r\nfor your country, I could not but see with pain that, though you have\r\ntaken no share in Philip’s acts of injustice, on you will fall the first\r\nblows of a war so terrible, and I thought it my duty to warn you of my\r\npurpose before I proceed to execute it.  If you can prevail upon the King\r\nof Spain to withdraw the army which he is having levied on the frontier,\r\nand to give no protection for the future to rebels of my kingdom, I will\r\nnot declare war against him, provided that I have certain proof of your\r\ngood intentions, and that you give me reasonable securities for them\r\nbefore the 1st of January in the approaching year.”  [_Lettres missives\r\nde Henri IV,_ p. 280--De Thou, _Histoire universelle,_ t. xii.  pp. 328-\r\n342.]\r\n\r\nThese letters, conveyed to Arras by one of the king’s trumpeters,\r\nreceived no answer.  The estates of Flanders, in assembly at Brussels,\r\nsomewhat more bold than those of Artois and Hainault, in vain represented\r\nto their Spanish governor their plaints and their desires for peace; for\r\ntwo months Henry IV. heard not a word on the subject.  Philip II.\r\npersisted in his active hostility, and continued to give the King of\r\nFrance no title but that of Prince of Bearn.  On the 17th of January,\r\n1595, Henry, in performance of what he had proclaimed, formally declared\r\nwar against the King of Spain, forbade his subjects to have any com merce\r\nwith him or his allies, and ordered them to make war on him for the\r\nfuture just as he persisted in making it on France. This able and worthy\r\nresolve was not approved of by Rosny, by this time the foremost of\r\nHenry’s IV.’s councillors, although he had not yet risen in the\r\ngovernment, or, probably, in the king’s private confidence, to the\r\nsuperior rank that he did attain by the eminence of his services and the\r\ncourageous sincerity of his devotion.  In his _OEconomies royales_ it is\r\nto interested influence, on the part of England and Holland, that he\r\nattributes this declaration of war against Philip II., “into which,” he\r\nsays, “the king allowed himself to be hurried against his own feelings.”\r\n It was assuredly in accordance with his own feelings and of his own free\r\nwill that Henry acted in this important decision; he had a political\r\norder of mind greater, more inventive, and more sagacious than Rosny’s\r\nadministrative order of mind, strong common sense and painstaking\r\nfinancial abilities.  To spontaneously declare war against Philip after\r\nthe capitulation of Paris and the conquest of three quarters of France\r\nwas to proclaim that the League was at death’s door, that there was no\r\nlonger any civil war in France, and that her king had no more now than\r\nforeign war to occupy him.  To make alliance, in view of that foreign\r\nwar, with the Protestant sovereigns of England, Holland, and Germany,\r\nagainst the exclusive and absolutist patron of Catholicism, was on the\r\npart of a king but lately Protestant, and now become resolutely Catholic,\r\nto separate openly politics from religion, and to subserve the temporal\r\ninterests of the realm of France whilst putting himself into the hands of\r\nthe spiritual head of the church as regarded matters of faith.  Henry\r\nIV., moreover, discovered another advantage in this line of conduct; it\r\nrendered possible and natural the important act for which he was even\r\nthen preparing, and which will be spoken of directly, the edict of Nantes\r\nin favor of the Protestants, which was the charter of religious tolerance\r\nand the securities for it, pending the advent of religious liberty and\r\nits rights, that fundamental principle, at this day, of moral and social\r\norder in France.  Such were Henry IV.’s grand and premonitory instincts\r\nwhen, on the 17th of January, 1595, he officially declared against Philip\r\nII. that war which Philip had not for a moment ceased to make on him.\r\n\r\nThe conflict thus solemnly begun between France and Spain lasted three\r\nyears and three months, from the 17th of January, 1595, to the 1st of\r\nMay, 1598, from Henry IV.’s declaration of war to the peace of Vervins,\r\nwhich preceded by only four months and thirteen days the death of Philip\r\nII. and the end of the preponderance of Spain in Europe.  It is not worth\r\nwhile to follow step by step the course of this monotonous conflict,\r\npregnant with facts which had their importance for contemporaries, but\r\nare not worthy of an historical resurrection.  Notice will be drawn only\r\nto those incidents in which the history of France is concerned, and which\r\ngive a good idea of Henry IV.’s character, the effectiveness of his\r\ngovernment, and the rapid growth of his greatness in Europe, contrasted\r\nwith his rival’s slow decay.\r\n\r\nFour months and a half after the declaration of war, and during the\r\ncampaign begun in Burgundy between the French and the Spaniards, on the\r\n5th of June, 1595, near Fontaine-Francaise, a large burgh a few leagues\r\nfrom Dijon, there took place an encounter which, without ending in a\r\ngeneral battle, was an important event, and caused so much sensation that\r\nit brought about political results more important than the immediate\r\ncause of them.  Henry IV. made up his mind to go and reconnoitre in\r\nperson the approaches of Dijon, towards which the enemy were marching.\r\nHe advanced, with about a hundred and fifty men-at-arms and as many\r\nmounted arquebusiers, close up to the burgh of Saint-Seine; from there he\r\nsent the Marquis of Mirebeau with fifty or sixty horse to “go,” says\r\nSully, “and take stock of the enemy;” and he put himself on the track of\r\nhis lieutenant, marching as a simple captain of light-horse, with the\r\npurpose of becoming better acquainted with the set of the country, so as\r\nto turn it to advantage if the armies had to encounter.  But he had not\r\ngone more than a league when he saw Mirebeau returning at more than a\r\nfoot-pace and in some disorder; who informed him “that he had been\r\nsuddenly charged by as many as three or four hundred horse, who did not\r\ngive him leisure to extend his view as he could have desired, and that he\r\nbelieved that the whole army of the Constable of Castille was marching in\r\na body to come and quarter themselves in the burgh of Saint-Seine.”\r\n Marshal de Biron, who joined the king at this moment, offered to go and\r\nlook at the enemy, and bring back news that could be depended upon; but\r\nscarcely had he gone a thousand paces when he descried, on the top of a\r\nlittle valley, some sixty horse halted there as if they were on guard; he\r\ncharged them, toppled them over, and taking their ground, discovered the\r\nwhole Spanish army marching in order of battle and driving before them a\r\nhundred of the king’s horse, who were flying in disorder.  Biron halted\r\nand showed a firm front to the enemy’s approach; but he was himself hard\r\npressed at many points, and was charged with such impetuosity that he was\r\nobliged to begin a retreat which changed before long to a sort of flight,\r\nwith a few sword-cuts about the ears.  Thus he arrived within sight of\r\nthe king, who immediately detached a hundred horse to support Biron and\r\nstop the fugitives; but the little re-enforcement met with the same fate\r\nas those it went to support; it was overthrown and driven pell-mell right\r\nup to the king, who suddenly found himself with seven or eight hundred\r\nhorse on his hands, without counting the enemy’s main army, which could\r\nalready be discerned in the distance.  Far from being dumbfounded, the\r\nking, “borrowing,” says Sully, “increase of judgment and courage from the\r\ngreatness of the peril,” called all his men about him, formed them into\r\ntwo squadrons of a hundred and fifty men each, gave one to M. de la\r\nTremoille with orders to go and charge the Spanish cavalry on one flank,\r\nput himself at the head of the other squadron, and the two charges of the\r\nFrench were “so furious and so determined,” says Sully, the king mingling\r\nin the thickest of the fight and setting an example to the boldest, “that\r\nthe Spanish squadrons in dismay tumbled one over another, and retired\r\nhalf-routed to the main body of Mayenne’s army; who, seeing a dash made\r\nto the king’s assistance by some of his bravest officers with seven or\r\neight hundred horse, thought all the royal army was there, and, fearing\r\nto attack those gentry of whose determination he had just made proof, he\r\nhimself gave his troops the order to retreat, Henry going on in pursuit\r\nuntil he had forced them to recross the Sane below Gray, leaving Burgundy\r\nat his discretion.”\r\n\r\nA mere abridgment has been given of the story relating to this brilliant\r\naffair as it appears in the (_OEconomies Royales_ of Sully [t. ii.\r\npp. 377-387], who was present and hotly engaged in the fight.  We will\r\nquote word for word, however, the account of Henry IV. himself, who sent\r\na report four days afterwards to his sister Catherine and to the\r\nConstable Anne de Montmorency.  To the latter he wrote on the 8th of\r\nJune, 1595, from Dijon, “I was informed that the Constable of Castile,\r\naccompanied by the Duke of Mayenne, was crossing the River Sane with his\r\narmy to come and succor the castle of this town.  I took horse the day\r\nafter, attended by my cousin Marshal de Biron and from seven to eight\r\nhundred horse, to go and observe his plans on the spot.  Whence it\r\nhappened that, intending to take the same quarters without having any\r\ncertain advices about one another, we met sooner than we had hoped, and\r\nso closely that my cousin the marshal, who led the first troop, was\r\nobliged to charge those who had advanced, and I to support him. But our\r\ndisadvantage was, that all our troops had not yet arrived and joined me,\r\nfor I had but from two to three hundred horse, whereas the enemy had all\r\nhis cavalry on the spot, making over a thousand or twelve hundred drawn\r\nup by squadrons and in order of battle.  However, my said cousin did not\r\nhaggle about them; and, seeing that they were worsting him, because the\r\ngame was too uneven, I determined to make one in it, and joined in it to\r\nsuch a purpose and with such luck, thank God, together with the following\r\nI had, that we put them to the rout.  But I can assure you that it was\r\nnot at the first charge, for we made several; and if the rest of my\r\nforces had been with me, I should no doubt have defeated all their\r\ncavalry, and perhaps their foot who were in order of battle behind the\r\nothers, having at their head the said Constable of Castile.  But our\r\nforces were so unequal that I could do no more than put to flight those\r\nwho would not do battle, after having cut in pieces the rest, as we had\r\ndone; wherein I can tell you, my dear cousin, that my said cousin Marshal\r\nde Biron and I did some good handiwork.  He was wounded in the head by a\r\nblow from a cutlass in the second charge, for he and I had nothing on but\r\nour cuirasses, not having had time to arm ourselves further, so surprised\r\nand hurried were we.  However, my said cousin did not fail, after his\r\nwound, to return again to the charge three or four times, as I too did on\r\nmy side.  Finally we did so well that the field and their dead were left\r\nto us to the number of a hundred or six score, and as many prisoners of\r\nall ranks.  Whereat the said Constable of Castile took such alarm that he\r\nat once recrossed the Sane; and I have been told that it was not without\r\nreproaching the Duke of Mayenne with having deceived him in not telling\r\nhim of my arrival in this country.”\r\n\r\nThe day before, June 7, Henry had written to his sister Catherine de\r\nBourbon, “My dear sister, the more I go on, the more do I wonder at the\r\ngrace shown me by God in the fight of last Monday, wherein I thought to\r\nhave defeated but twelve hundred horse; but they must be set down at two\r\nthousand.  The Constable of Castile was there in person with the Duke of\r\nMayenne; and they both of them saw me and recognized me quite well; they\r\nsent to demand of me a whole lot of Italian and Spanish captains of\r\ntheirs, the which were not prisoners.  They must be amongst the dead who\r\nhave been buried, for I requested next day that they should be.  Many of\r\nour young noblemen, seeing me with them everywhere, were full of fire in\r\nthis engagement, and showed a great deal of courage; amongst whom I came\r\nacross Gramont, Termes, Boissy, La Curse, and the Marquis of Mirebeau,\r\nwho, as luck would have it, found themselves at it without any armor but\r\ntheir neck-pieces and _gaillardets_ (front and back plates), and did\r\nmarvels.  There were others who did not do so well, and many who did very\r\nill.  Those who were not there ought to be sorry for it, seeing that I\r\nhad need of all my good friends, and I saw you very near becoming my\r\nheiress.”  [_Lettres missives de Henri IV.,_ t. iv.  pp. 363-369; in the\r\n_Collection des Documents inedits sur l’Histoire de France_.]\r\n\r\nThis fight, so unpremeditated, at Fontaine-Francaise, and the presence of\r\nmind, steady quicksightedness, and brilliant dash of Henry IV., led off\r\nthis long war gloriously.  Its details were narrated and sought after\r\nminutely; people were especially struck with the sympathetic attention\r\nthat in the very midst of the strife the king bestowed upon all his\r\ncompanions in arms, either to give them directions or to warn them of\r\ndanger.  “At the hottest of the fight,” says the contemporary historian\r\nPeter Matthieu, “Henry, seizing Mirebeau by the arm, said, ‘Charge\r\nyonder!’ which he did: and that troop began to thin off and disappear.”\r\n A moment afterwards, seeing one of the enemy’s men-at-arms darting down\r\nupon the French, Henry concluded that the attack was intended for\r\nGilbert, de la Cure, a brave and pious Catholic lord, whom he called\r\nfamiliarly _Monsieur le Cure,_ and shouted to him from afar, “Look out,\r\nLa Curee!” which warned him and saved his life.  The roughest warriors\r\nwere touched by this fraternal solicitude of the king’s, and clung to him\r\nwith passionate devotion.\r\n\r\nIt was at Rome, and in the case of an ecclesiastical question that Henry\r\nIV.’s steady policy, his fame for ability as well as valor, and the\r\nglorious affair of Fontaine-Francaise bore their first fruits.  Mention\r\nhas already been made of the formal refusal the king had met with from\r\nPope Clement VIII. in January, 1594, when he had demanded of him, by the\r\nembassy extraordinary of the Duke of Nevers, confirmation of the\r\nabsolution granted him by the French bishops after his conversation at\r\nSt. Denis and his anointment at Chartres.  The pope, in spite of his\r\nrefusal, had indirectly given the royal agents to understand that they\r\nwere not to be discouraged; and the ablest of them, Arnold d’Ossat, had\r\nremained at Rome to conduct this delicate and dark commission.  When\r\nClement VIII. saw Henry IV.’s government growing stronger and more\r\nextensive day by day, Paris returned to his power, the League beaten and\r\nthe Gallican church upheld in its maxims by the French magistracy, fear\r\nof schism grew serious at Rome, and the pope had a hint given by Cardinal\r\nde Gondi to Henry that, if he were to send fresh ambassadors, they might\r\nbe favorably listened to.  Arnold d’Ossat had acquired veritable weight\r\nat the court of Rome, and had paved the way with a great deal of art\r\ntowards turning to advantage any favorable chances that might offer\r\nthemselves.  Villeroi, having broken with the League, had become Henry\r\nIV.’s minister of foreign affairs, and obtained some confidence at Rome\r\nin return for the good will he testified towards the papacy.  By his\r\ncouncillor’s advice, no doubt, the king made no official stir, sent no\r\nbrilliant embassy; D’Ossat quietly resumed negotiations, and alone\r\nconducted them from the end of 1594 to the spring of 1595; and when a new\r\nenvoy was chosen to bring them to a conclusion, it was not a great lord,\r\nbut a learned ecclesiastic, Abbot James du Perron, whose ability and\r\ndevotion Henry IV.  had already, at the time of his conversion,\r\nexperienced, and whom he had lately appointed Bishop of Evreux.  Even\r\nwhen Du Perron had been fixed upon to go to Rome and ask for the\r\nabsolution which Clement VIII. had seven or eight months before refused,\r\nhe was in no hurry to repair thither, and D’Ossat’s letters make it\r\nappear that he was expected there with some impatience.  He arrived there\r\non the 12th of July, 1595, and, in concert with D’Ossat, he presented to\r\nthe pope the request of the king, who solicited the papal benediction,\r\nabsolution from any censure, and complete reconciliation with the Roman\r\nchurch.  Clement VIII., on the 2d of August, assembled his consistory,\r\nwhither went all the cardinals, save two partisans of Spain who excused\r\nthemselves on the score of health.  Parleys took place as to the form of\r\nthe decree which must precede the absolution.  The pope would have liked\r\nvery much to insert two clauses, one revoking as null and void the\r\nabsolution already given to the king by the French bishops at the time of\r\nhis conversion, and the other causing the absolution granted by the pope\r\nto be at the same time considered as re-establishing Henry IV. in his\r\nrights to the crown, whereof it was contended that he was deprived by the\r\nexcommunication and censures of Sixtus V. and Gregory XIV., which this\r\nabsolution was to remove.  The two French negotiators rejected these\r\nattempts, and steadily maintained the complete independence of the king’s\r\ntemporal sovereignty, as well as the power of intervention of the French\r\nepiscopate in his absolution.  Clement VIII. was a judicious and prudent\r\npope; and he did not persist.  The absolution was solemnly pronounced on\r\nthe 17th of September, 1595, by the pope himself, from a balcony erected\r\nin St. Peter’s Square, and in presence of the population.  The gates of\r\nthe church were thrown open and a Te Deum was sung.  A grand ceremony\r\ntook place immediately afterwards in the church of St. Louis of the\r\nFrench.  Rome was illuminated for three days, and, on the 7th of November\r\nfollowing, a pope’s messenger left for Paris with the bull of absolution\r\ndrawn up in the terms agreed upon.\r\n\r\nAnother reconciliation, of less solemnity, but of great importance, that\r\nbetween the Duke of Mayenne and Henry IV., took place a week after the\r\nabsolution pronounced by the pope.  As soon as the civil war, continued\r\nby the remnants of the dying League, was no more than a disgraceful\r\nauxiliary to the foreign war between France and Spain, Mayenne was in his\r\nsoul both grieved and disgusted at it.  The affair of Fontaine-Francaise\r\ngave him an opportunity of bringing matters to a crisis; he next day\r\nbroke with the Constable of Castile, Don Ferdinand de Velasco, who\r\ndeclined to follow his advice, and at once entered into secret\r\nnegotiations with the king.  Henry wrote from Lyons to Du Plessis-Mornay,\r\non the 24th of August, 1595, “The Duke of Mayenne has asked me to allow\r\nhim three months for the purpose of informing the enemy of his\r\ndetermination in order to induce them to join him in recognizing me and\r\nserving me.  So doing, he has also agreed to bind himself from this\r\npresent date to recognize me and serve me, whatever his friends may do.”\r\n On the 23d of September following, Henry IV., still at Lyons, sent to M.\r\nde la Chatre:--\r\n\r\n“I forward you the articles of a general truce which I have granted to\r\nthe Duke of Mayenne at his pressing instance, and on the assurance he has\r\ngiven me that he will get it accepted and observed by all those who are\r\nstill making war within my kingdom, in his name or that of the League.”\r\n This truce was, in point of fact, concluded by a preliminary treaty\r\nsigned at Chalons, and by virtue of which Mayenne ordered his lieutenants\r\nto give up to the king the citadel of Dijon.  The negotiations continued,\r\nand, in January, 1596, a royal edict, signed at Folembray, near Laon,\r\nregulated, in thirty-one articles and some secret articles, the\r\nconditions of peace between the king and Mayenne.  The king granted him,\r\nhimself and his partisans, full and complete amnesty for the past,\r\nbesides three surety-places for six years, and divers sums, which, may be\r\nfor payment of his debts, and may be for his future provision, amounted\r\nto three million five hundred and eighty thousand livres at that time\r\n(twelve million eight hundred and eighty-eight thousand francs of the\r\npresent day).  The Parliament of Paris considered these terms exorbitant,\r\nand did not consent to enregister the edict until April 9, 1596, after\r\nthree letters jussory from the king.  Henry IV. nobly expressed, in the\r\npreamble of the edict, the motives of policy that led to his generous\r\narrangements; after alluding to his late reconciliation with the pope,\r\n“Our work,” he said, “would have been imperfect, and peace incomplete, if\r\nour most dear and most beloved cousin, the Duke of Mayenne, chief of his\r\nparty, had not followed the same road, as he resolved to do so soon as he\r\nsaw that our holy father had approved of our reunion.  This hath made us\r\nto perceive better than heretofore the aim of his actions, to accept and\r\ntake in good part all that he hath exhibited against us of the zeal he\r\nfelt for religion, and to commend the anxiety he hath displayed to\r\npreserve the kingdom in, its entirety, whereof he caused not and suffered\r\nnot the dismemberment when the prosperity of his affairs seemed to give\r\nhim some means of it; the which he was none the more inclined to do when\r\nhe became weakened, but preferred to throw himself into our arms rather\r\nthan betake himself to other remedies, which might have caused the war to\r\nlast a long while yet, to the great damage of our people.  This it is\r\nwhich hath made us desire to recognize his good intent, to love him and\r\ntreat him for the future as our good relative and faithful subject.”\r\n [_Memoires de la Ligue,_ t. vi.  p. 349.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Castle of Monceaux----91]\r\n\r\nTo a profound and just appreciation of men’s conduct Henry IV. knew how\r\nto add a winning grace and the surprising charm of a familiar manner.\r\nAfter having signed the edict of Folembray, he had gone to rest a while\r\nat Monceaux.  Mayenne went to visit him there on the 31st of January,\r\n1596.  There is nothing to be added to or taken from the account given by\r\nSully of their interview.  “The king, stepping forward to meet Mayenne,\r\nembraced him thrice, assuring him that he was welcome, and that he\r\nembraced him as cordially as if there had never been anything between\r\nthem.  M. de Mayenne put one knee on the ground, embraced the king’s\r\nthigh, and assured him that he was his very humble servant and subject,\r\nsaying that he considered himself greatly bounden to him, as well for\r\nhaving with so much, of gentleness, kindness, and special largesses\r\nrestored him to his duty, as for having delivered him from Spanish\r\narrogance and Italian crafts and wiles.  Then the king, having raised him\r\nup and embraced him once more, told him that he had no doubt at all of\r\nhis honor and word, for a man of worth and of good courage held nothing\r\nso dear as the observance thereof.  Thereupon he took him by the hand and\r\nbegan to walk him about at a very great pace, showing him the alleys and\r\ntelling all his plans and the beauties and conveniences of this mansion.\r\nM. de Mayenne, who was incommoded by a sciatica, followed as best he\r\ncould, but some way behind, dragging his limbs after him very heavily.\r\nWhich the king observing, and that he was mighty red, heated, and was\r\npuffing with thickness of breath, he turned to Rosny, whom he held, with\r\nthe other hand, and said in his ear, ‘If I walk this fat carcass here\r\nabout much longer, then am I avenged without much difficulty for all the\r\nevils he hath done us, for he is a dead man.’  And thereupon pulling up,\r\nthe king said to him, ‘Tell the truth, cousin, I go a little too fast for\r\nyou; and I have worked you too hard.’  ‘By my faith, sir,’ said M. de\r\nMayenne, slapping his hand upon his stomach, ‘it is true; I swear to you\r\nthat I am so tired and out of breath that I can no more.  If you had\r\ncontinued walking me about so fast, for honor and courtesy did not permit\r\nme to say to you, “Hold! enough!” and still less to leave you, I believe\r\nthat you would have killed me without a thought of it.’  Then the king\r\nembraced him, clapped him on the shoulder, and said with a laughing face,\r\nopen glance, and holding out his hand, ‘Come, take that, cousin, for, by\r\nGod, this is all the injury and displeasure you shall ever have from me;\r\nof that I give you my honor and word with all my heart, the which I never\r\ndid and never will violate.’  ‘By God, sir,’ answered M. de Mayenne,\r\nkissing the king’s hand and doing what he could to put one knee upon the\r\nground, ‘I believe it and all other generous things that may be expected\r\nfrom the best and bravest prince of our age.  And you said it, too, in so\r\nfrank a spirit and with so kindly a grace that my feelings and my\r\nobligations are half as deep again.  However, I swear to you over again,\r\nsir, by the living God, on my faith, my honor, and my salvation, that I\r\nwill be to you, all my life long, loyal subject and faithful servant; I\r\nwill never fail you nor desert you; I will have while I live no desires\r\nor designs of importance which are not suggested by your Majesty himself;\r\nnor will I ever be cognizant of them in the case of others, though they\r\nwere my own children, without expressly opposing them and giving you\r\nnotice of them at once.’  ‘There, there, cousin,’ rejoined the kinm, ‘I\r\nquite believe it; and that you may be able to love me and serve me long,\r\ngo rest you, refresh you, and drink a draught at the castle.  I have in\r\nmy cellars some Arbois wine, of which I will send you two bottles, for\r\nwell I know that you do not dislike it.  And here is Rosny, whom I will\r\nlend you to accompany you, to do the honors of the house and to conduct\r\nyou to your chamber: he is one of my oldest servants, and one of those\r\nwho have been most rejoiced to see that you would love me and serve me\r\ncordially.’” [(OEconomies royales, t. iii.  pp. 7-10.]\r\n\r\nMayenne was as good as his word.  After the edict of Folembray, he lived\r\nfourteen years at the court of Henry IV., whom he survived only about\r\nsixteen months [for he died on the 4th of October, 1611, and Henry IV.\r\nwas assassinated by Ravaillac on the 13th of May, 1610], and during all\r\nthat time he was loyal and faithful to him, never giving him any but good\r\ncounsels and sometimes rendering him useful services.  A rare example of\r\na party-chief completely awakened and tamed by experience: it made him\r\ndisgusted with fanaticism, faction, civil war, and complicity with the\r\nforeigner.  He was the least brilliant but the most sensible, the most\r\nhonest, and the most French of the Guises.  Henry IV., when seriously ill\r\nat Fontainebleau in 1608, recommended him to Queen Mary de’ Medici as one\r\nof the men whom it was most important to call to the councils of state;\r\nand, at the approach of death, Mayenne, weary and weak in the lap of\r\nrepose, could conscientiously address those who were around him in such\r\ngrand and Christian language as this: “It is no new thing to know that I\r\nmust die; for twelve years past my lingering and painful life has been\r\nfor the most part an apprenticeship thereto.  My sufferings have so\r\ndulled the sting of death that I rather count upon it than dread it;\r\nhappy to have had so long a delay to teach me to make a good end, and to\r\nrid me of the things which formerly kept me from that knowledge.  Happy\r\nto meet my end amongst mine own people and to terminate by a peaceful\r\ndeath the sufferings and miseries of my life.  I formerly sought death\r\namidst arms; but I am better pleased, for my soul’s salvation, to meet it\r\nand embrace it on my bed than if I had encountered it in battle, for the\r\nsake of the glory of the world.”\r\n\r\nLet, us return to Henry IV.  Since his declaration of war against Philip\r\nII. he had gained much ground.  He had fought gloriously, in his own\r\nperson, and beaten the Spaniards at Fontaine-Francaise.  He had obtained\r\nfrom Pope Clement VIII. the complete and solemn absolution which had been\r\nrefused to him the year before.  Mayenne had submitted to him, and that\r\nsubmission had been death to the League.  Some military reverses were\r\nintermingled with these political successes.  Between the 25th of June,\r\n1595, and the 10th of March, 1597, the Spanish armies took, in Picardy\r\nand Artois, Le Catelet, Doullens, Cambrai, Ardres, Ham, Guines and two\r\ntowns of more importance, Calais, still the object of English ambition\r\nand of offers on the part of Queen Elizabeth to any one who could hand it\r\nover to her, and Amiens, one of the keys to France on the frontier of the\r\nnorth.  These checks were not without compensation.  Henry invested and\r\ntook the strong place of La Fere; and he retook Amiens after a six\r\nmonths’ struggle.  A Spanish plot for getting possession of Marseilles\r\nfailed; the young Duke of Guise, whom Henry had made governor of\r\nProvence, entered the city amidst shouts of Hurrah for the king!\r\n“Now I am king!” cried Henry, on receiving the news, so generally was\r\nMarseilles even then regarded as the queen of the Mediterranean.  The\r\nDuke of Epernon, who had attempted to make of Provence an independent\r\nprincipality for himself, was obliged to leave it and treat with the\r\nking, ever ready to grant easy terms to those who could give up to him or\r\nsell him any portion of his kingdom.  France was thus being rapidly\r\nreconstituted.  “Since the month of January, 1596, Burgundy, parts of\r\nForez, Auvergne, and Velay, the whole of Provence, half Languedoc, and\r\nthe last town of Poitou had been brought back to their allegiance to the\r\nking.  French territory and national unity had nothing more to wait for,\r\nto complete their re-establishment, than a portion of Brittany and four\r\ntowns of Picardy still occupied by the Spaniards.”  [Poirson, _Histoire\r\ndu Regne de Henri IV., t. ii.  p. 159.]\r\n\r\nBut these results were only obtained at enormous expense and by means of\r\npecuniary sacrifices, loans, imposts, obligations of every sort, which\r\nleft the king in inextricable embarrassment, and France in a condition of\r\nexhaustion still further aggravated by the deplorable administration of\r\nthe public finances.  On the 15th of April, 1596, Henry IV. wrote from\r\nAmiens to Rosny, “My friend, you know as well as any of my servants what\r\ntroubles, labors, and fatigues I have had to go through to secure my life\r\nand my dignity against so many sorts of enemies and perils.  Nevertheless\r\nI swear to you that all these traverses have not caused me so much\r\naffliction and bitterness of spirit as the sorrow and annoyance I now\r\nfeel at finding thyself in continual controversies with those most in\r\nauthority of my servants, officers, and councillors of state, when I\r\nwould fain set about restoring this kingdom to its highest splendor, and\r\nrelieving my poor people, whom I love as my dear children (God having at\r\npresent granted me no others), from so many talliages, subsidies,\r\nvexations, and oppressions whereof they daily make complaints to me.\r\n.  .  .  Having written to them who are of my council of finance how that\r\nI had a design of extreme importance in hand for which I had need of a\r\nfund of eight hundred thousand crowns, and therefore I begged and\r\nconjured them, by their loyalty and sincere affection towards me and\r\nFrance, to labor diligently for the certain raising of that sum, all\r\ntheir answers, after several delays, excuses, and reasons whereof one\r\ndestroyed another, had finally no other conclusion than representations\r\nof difficulties and impossibilities.  Nay, they feared not to send me\r\nword that so far from being able to furnish me with so notable a sum,\r\nthey found great trouble in raising the funds to keep my household going.\r\n.  .  .  I am resolved to know truly whether the necessities which are\r\noverwhelming me proceed from the malice, bad management, or ignorance of\r\nthose whom I employ, or, good sooth, from the diminution of my revenues\r\nand the poverty of my people.  And to that end, I mean to convoke the\r\nthree orders of my kingdom, for to have of them some advice and aid, and\r\nmeanwhile to establish among those people some loyal servant of mine,\r\nwhom I will put in authority little by little, in order that he may\r\ninform me of what passes in my council, and enlighten me as to that which\r\nI desire to know.  I have, as I have already told you, cast my eyes upon\r\nyou to serve me in this commission, not doubting at all that I shall\r\nreceive contentment and advantage from your administration.  And I wish\r\nto tell you the state to which I am reduced, which is such that I am very\r\nnear the enemy, and have not, as you may say, a horse to fight on or a\r\nwhole suit of harness to my back.  My shirts are all torn, my doublets\r\nout at elbows; my cupboard is often bare, and for the last two days I\r\nhave been dining and supping with one and another; my purveyors say they\r\nhave no more means of supplying my table, especially as for more than six\r\nmonths they have had no money.  Judge whether I deserve to be so treated,\r\nand fail not to come.  I have on my mind, besides, two or three other\r\nmatters of consequence on which I wish to employ you the moment you\r\narrive.  Do not speak of all this to anybody whatsoever, not even to your\r\nwife.  Adieu, my friend, whom well I love.”\r\n\r\nHenry IV. accomplished all that, when he wrote to Rosny, he had showed\r\nhimself resolved to undertake.  External circumstances became favorable\r\nto him.  Since his conversion to Catholicism, England and her queen,\r\nElizabeth, had been colder in the cause of the French alliance.  When,\r\nafter his declaration of war against Philip II., Henry demanded in London\r\nthe support on which he had believed that he might rely, Elizabeth\r\nanswered by demanding in her turn the cession of Calais as the price of\r\nher services.  Quite determined not to give up Calais to England, Henry,\r\nwithout complaining of the demand, let the negotiation drag, confining\r\nhimself to saying that he was looking for friends, not for masters.  When\r\nin April, 1596, it was known in London that Calais had been taken by the\r\nSpaniards, Elizabeth sent word to Henry, then at Boulogne, that she would\r\nsend him prompt assistance if he promised, when Calais was recovered from\r\nthe Spaniards, to place it in the hands of the English.  “If I must be\r\ndespoiled,” answered Henry, “I would rather it should be by my enemies\r\nthan by my friends.  In the former case it will be a reverse of fortune,\r\nin the latter I might be accused of poltroonery.”  Elizabeth assured the\r\nFrench ambassador, Harlay de Sancy, “that it had never been her intention\r\nto keep Calais, but simply to take care that, in any case, this important\r\nplace should not remain in the hands of the common enemy whilst the king\r\nwas engaged in other enterprises; anyhow,” she added, “she had ordered\r\nthe Earl of Essex, admiral of the English fleet raised against Spain, to\r\narm promptly in order to go to the king’s assistance.”  There was anxiety\r\nat that time in England about the immense preparations being made by\r\nPhilip for the invasion he proposed to attempt against England, and for\r\nthe putting to sea of his fleet, the Grand Armada.  In conversation with\r\nthe high treasurer, Lord Burleigh, Elizabeth’s chief minister, Sancy\r\nfound him even colder than his queen; Burleigh laid great stress upon all\r\nthat the queen had already done for France, and on the one million five\r\nhundred thousand gold crowns she had lent to the king.  “It would be more\r\nbecoming,” he said, “in the king’s envoys to thank the queen for the aid\r\nshe had already furnished than to ask for more; by dint of drawing water\r\nthe well had gone dry; the queen could offer the king only three thousand\r\nmen, on condition that they were raised at his own expense.”  “If the\r\nking,” replied Sancy, “must expect neither alliance nor effectual aid on\r\nyour part, he will be much obliged to the queen to let him know what\r\ncourse she takes, because he, on his side, will take that which will be\r\nmost expedient for his affairs.”  Some of the king’s councillors regarded\r\nit as possible that he should make peace with the King of Spain, and did\r\nnot refrain from letting as much be understood.  Negotiations in London\r\nseemed to be broken off; the French ambassadors had taken leave of\r\nElizabeth.  The news that came from Spain altered the tone of the English\r\ngovernment; threats of Spanish invasion became day by day more distinct\r\nand the Grand Armada more dreaded.  Elizabeth sent word to the\r\nambassadors of France by some of her confidants, amongst others Sir\r\nRobert Cecil, son of the high treasurer, that she was willing to give\r\nthem a last audience before their departure.  The result of this audience\r\nwas the conclusion of a treaty of alliance offensive and defensive\r\nbetween France and England against the King of Spain, with a mutual\r\npromise not to make, one without the other, either peace or truce, with\r\nprecise stipulations as to the number and pay of the troops which the\r\nQueen of England should put in the field for the service of the King of\r\nFrance, and, further, with a proviso establishing freedom of trade\r\nbetween the two states.  The treaty was drawn up in London on the 24th of\r\nMay, 1596, ratified at Rouen by Henry IV. on the 19th of October\r\nfollowing, and on the 31st of October the States-General of Holland\r\nacceded to it, whilst regulating, accordingly, the extent of their\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\nEasy as to the part to be played by his allies in the war with Spain,\r\nHenry IV. set to work upon the internal reforms and measures of which he\r\nstrongly felt the necessity.  They were of two kinds; one administrative\r\nand financial, the other political and religious; he wished at one and\r\nthe same time to consolidate the material forces of his government and to\r\ngive his Protestant subjects, lately his own brethren, the legal liberty\r\nand security which they needed for their creed’s sake, and to which they\r\nhad a right.\r\n\r\nHe began, about the middle of October, 1596, by bringing Rosny into the\r\ncouncil of finance, saying to him, “You promise me, you know, to be a\r\ngood manager, and that you and I shall lop arms and legs from _Madame\r\nGrivelee,_ as you have so often told me could be done.”  _Madame Grivelee\r\n(Mrs. Pickings)_ was, in the language of the day, she who presided over\r\nillicit gains made in the administration of the public finances.  Rosny\r\nat once undertook to accomplish that which he had promised the king.  He\r\nmade, in person, a minute examination of four receiver-generals’ offices,\r\nin order, with that to guide him, to get a correct idea of the amount\r\nderived from imposts and the royal revenues, and of what became of this\r\namount in its passage from collection to employment for the defrayal of\r\nthe expenses of the state.  “When he went on his inspection, the\r\ntreasurers of France, receivers, accountants, comptrollers, either\r\nabsented themselves or refused to produce him any register; he suspended\r\nsome, frightened others, surmounted the obstacles of every kind that were\r\nput in his way, and he proved, from the principal items of receipt and\r\nexpenditure at these four general offices, so much and such fraudulence\r\nthat he collected five hundred thousand crowns (one million five hundred\r\nthousand livres of those times, and about five million four hundred and\r\nninety thousand francs of the present date), had these sums placed in\r\nseventy carts, and drove them to Rouen, where the king was and where the\r\nAssembly of Notables had just met.”\r\n\r\nIt was not the states-general properly so called that Henry IV. had\r\nconvoked; he had considered that his authority was still too feebly\r\nconstituted, and even too much disputed in a portion of the kingdom, to\r\nallow him to put it to such a test; and honest and sensible patriots had\r\nbeen of the same opinion D’Aubigne himself, the most independent and\r\nfault-finding spirit amongst his contemporaries, expressly says, “The\r\ntroubles which were not yet extinguished in France did not admit of a\r\nlarger convocation; the hearts of the people were not yet subdued and\r\nkneaded to obedience, as appeared from the excitement which supervened.”\r\n [_Histoire universelle,_ t. iii.  p. 526.]  Besides, Henry himself\r\nacknowledged, in the circular which he published on the 25th of July,\r\n1596, at this juncture, the superior agency of the states-general.\r\n“We would gladly have brought them together in full assembly,” he said,\r\n“if the armed efforts of our enemies allowed of any longer delay in\r\nfinding a remedy for the plague which is racking us so violently; our\r\nintent is, pending the coming of the said states, to put a stop to all\r\nthese disorders in the best and quickest way possible.”  “The king,\r\nmoreover,” says Sully, “had no idea of imitating the kings his\r\npredecessors in predilection for, and appointment of, certain deputies\r\nfor whom he had a particular fancy; but he referred the nomination\r\nthereof to them of the church, of the noblesse, and of the people; and\r\nwhen they were assembled, he prescribed to them no rules, forms, or\r\nlimits, but left them complete freedom of their opinions, utterances,\r\nsuffrages, and deliberations.”  [OEconomies royales, t. iii.  p. 29.]\r\nThe notables met at Rouen to the number of eighty, nine of the clergy,\r\nnineteen of the noblesse, fifty-two of the third estate.  The king opened\r\nthe assembly on the 4th of November, 1596, with these words, full of\r\ndignity, and powerful in their vivid simplicity: “If I desired to win the\r\ntitle of orator, I would have learned by rote some fine, long speech, and\r\nwould deliver it to you with proper gravity.  But, gentlemen, my desire\r\nprompts me towards two more glorious titles, the names of deliverer and\r\nrestorer of this kingdom.  In order to attain whereto I have gathered you\r\ntogether.  You know to your cost, as I to mine, that when it pleased God\r\nto call me to this crown, I found France not only all but ruined, but\r\nalmost entirely lost to Frenchmen.  By the divine favor, by the prayers\r\nand the good counsels of my servants who are not in the profession of\r\narms, by the sword of my brave and generous noblesse, from whom I single\r\nout not the princes, upon the honor of a gentleman, as the holders of our\r\nproudest title, and by my own pains and labors, I have preserved her from\r\nperdition.  Let us now preserve her from ruin.  Share, my dear subjects,\r\nin this second triumph as you did in the first.  I have not summoned you,\r\nlike my predecessors, to get your approbation of their own wills.  I have\r\nhad you assembled in order to receive your counsels, put faith in them,\r\nfollow them, in short, place myself under guardianship in your hands; a\r\ndesire but little congenial to kings, graybeards, and conquerors.  But\r\nthe violent love I feel towards my subjects, and the extreme desire I\r\nhave to add those two proud titles to that of king, make everything easy\r\nand honorable to me.”\r\n\r\nL’Estoile relates that the king’s favorite, Gabrielle d’Estrees, was at\r\nthe session behind some tapestry, and that, Henry IV. having asked what\r\nshe thought of his speech, she answered, “I never heard better spoken;\r\nonly I was astonished that you spoke of placing yourself under\r\nguardianship.”  “Ventre saint-gris,” replied the king, “that is true; but\r\nI mean with my sword by my side.”  [_Journal de Pierre l’Estoile,_\r\nt. iii.  p. 185.]\r\n\r\nThe assembly of notables sat from November 4, 1596, to January 29, 1597,\r\nwithout introducing into the financial regimen any really effective\r\nreforms; the rating board (_conseil de raison_), the institution of which\r\nthey had demanded of the king, in connection with the fixing of imposts\r\nand employment of public revenues, was tried without success, and was not\r\nlong before, of its own accord, resigning its power into the king’s\r\nhands; but the mere convocation of this assembly was a striking instance\r\nof the homage paid by Henry IV. to that fundamental maxim of free\r\ngovernment, which, as early as under Louis XI., Philip de Commynes\r\nexpressed in these terms: “There is no king or lord on earth who hath\r\npower, over and above his own property, to put a single penny on his\r\nsubjects without grant and consent of those who have to pay, unless by\r\ntyranny and violence.”  The ideas expressed and the counsels given by the\r\nassembly of notables were not, however, without good effect upon the\r\ngeneral administration of the state; but the principal and most salutary\r\nresult of its presence and influence was the personal authority which\r\nSully drew from it, and of which he did not hesitate to make full use.\r\nHaving become superintendent-general of finance and grand master of the\r\nordnance, he exerted all his power to put in practice, as regarded the\r\nfinancial department, a system of receipts and expenses, and as regarded\r\nmaterials for the service of war, the reforms and maxims of economy,\r\naccountability, and supervision, which were suggested to him by his great\r\ngood sense, and in which Henry IV.  supported him with the spirit of one\r\nwho well appreciated the strength they conferred upon his government,\r\ncivil and military.\r\n\r\nHis relations with the Protestants gave him embarrassments to surmount\r\nand reforms to accomplish of quite a different sort, and more difficult\r\nstill.  At his accession, their satisfaction had not been untinged by\r\ndisquietude; they foresaw the sacrifices the king would be obliged to\r\nmake to his new and powerful friends the Catholics.  His conversion to\r\nCatholicism threw into more or less open opposition the most zealous and\r\nsome of the ambitious members of his late church.  It was not long before\r\ntheir feelings burst forth in reproaches, alarms, and attacks.  In 1597,\r\na pamphlet, entitled _The Plaints of the Reformed Churches of France_\r\n[_Memoires de la Ligue,_ t. vi.  pp. 428-486], was published and spread\r\nprodigiously.  “None can take it ill,” said the anonymous author, “that\r\nwe who make profession of the Reformed religion should come forward to\r\nget a hearing for our plaints touching so many deeds of outrage,\r\nviolence, and injustice which are daily done to us, and done not here or\r\nthere, but in all places of the realm; done at a time, under a reign in\r\nwhich they seemed less likely, and which ought to have given us better\r\nhopes.  .  .  .  We, sir, are neither Spaniards nor Leaguers; we have had\r\nsuch happiness as to see you, almost born and cradled, at any rate\r\nbrought up, amongst us; we have employed our properties, our lives, in\r\norder to prevent the effects of ill will on the part of those who, from\r\nyour cradle, sought your ruin; we have, with you and under your wise and\r\nvaliant leadership, made the chiefest efforts for the preservation of the\r\ncrown, which, thank God, is now upon your head.  .  .  .  We do beseech\r\nyou, sir, to give us permission to have the particulars of our grievances\r\nheard both by your Majesty and all your French, for we do make plaint of\r\nall the French.  Not that in so great and populous a kingdom we should\r\nimagine that there are not still to be found some whose hearts bleed to\r\nsee indignities so inhuman; but of what avail to us is all they may have\r\nin them of what is good, humane, and French?  A part of them are so soft,\r\nso timorous, that they would not so much as dare to show a symptom of not\r\nliking that which displeases them; and if, when they see us so\r\nmaltreated, they do summon up sufficient boldness to look another way,\r\nand think that they have done but their duty, still do they tremble with\r\nfear of being taken for favorers of heretics.”\r\n\r\nThe writer then enters upon an exposition of all the persecutions, all\r\nthe acts of injustice, all the evils of every kind that the reformers\r\nhave to suffer.  He lays the blame of them, as he has just said, upon the\r\nwhole French community, the noblesse, the commons, the magistracy, as\r\nwell as the Catholic priests and monks; he enumerates a multitude of\r\nspecial facts in support of his plaints.  “Good God!” he cries, “that\r\nthere should be no class, no estate in France, from which we can hope for\r\nany relief!  None from which we may not fear lest ruin come upon us!”\r\n And he ends by saying, “Stem, then, sir, with your good will and your\r\nauthority, the tide of our troubles.  Direct your counsels towards giving\r\nus some security.  Accustom your kingdom to at least endure us, if it\r\nwill not love us.  We demand of your Majesty an edict which may give us\r\nenjoyment of that which is common to all your subjects, that is to say,\r\nof far less than you have granted to your enemies, your rebels of the\r\nLeague.”\r\n\r\nWe will not stop to inquire whether the matters stated in these plaints\r\nare authentic or disputable, accurate or exaggerated; it is probable that\r\nthey contain a great deal of truth, and that, even under Henry IV., the\r\nProtestants had many sufferings to endure and disregarded rights to\r\nrecover.  The mistake they made and the injustice they showed consisted\r\nin not taking into, account all the good that Henry IV. had done them and\r\nwas daily doing them, and in calling upon him, at a moment’s notice, to\r\nsecure to them by an edict all the good that it was not in his power to\r\ndo them.  We purpose just to give a brief summary of the ameliorations\r\nintroduced into their position under him, even before the edict of\r\nNantes, and to transfer the responsibility for all they still lacked to\r\nthe cause indicated by themselves in their plaints, when they take to\r\ntask all the French on the Catholic side, who, in the sixteenth century,\r\ndisregarded in France the rights of creed and of religious life, just as\r\nthe Protestants themselves disregarded them in England so far as the\r\nCatholics were concerned.\r\n\r\nOne fact immediately deserves to be pointed out; and that is the number\r\nand the practical character of meetings officially held at this period by\r\nthe Protestants: an indisputable proof of the liberty they enjoyed.\r\nThese meetings were of two sorts; one, the synods, were for the purpose\r\nof regulating their faith, their worship, their purely religious affairs.\r\nBetween 1594 and 1609, under the sway of Henry IV., Catholic king, seven\r\nnational synods of the Protestant church in France held their sessions in\r\nseven different towns, and discussed with perfect freedom such questions\r\nof religious doctrine and discipline as were interesting to them.  At the\r\nsame epoch, between 1593 and 1608, the French Protestants met at eleven\r\nassemblies, specially summoned to deliberate, not in these cases upon\r\nquestions of faith and religious discipline, but upon their temporal and\r\npolitical interests, upon their relations towards the state, and upon the\r\nconduct they were to adopt under the circumstances of their times.  The\r\nprinciple to which minds, and even matters, to a certain extent, have now\r\nattained, the deep-seated separation between the civil and the religious\r\nlife, and their mutual independence, this higher principle was unknown to\r\nthe sixteenth century; the believer and the citizen were then but one,\r\nand the efforts of laws and governments were directed towards bringing\r\nthe whole nation entire into the same state of unity.  And as they did\r\nnot succeed therein, their attempts produced strife instead of unity, war\r\ninstead of peace.  When the French Protestants of the sixteenth century\r\nmet in the assemblies which they themselves called political, they acted\r\nas one nation confronting another nation, and labored to form a state\r\nwithin state.  We will borrow from the intelligent and learned _Histoire\r\nd’Henri IV.,_ by M. Poirson, (t. ii.  pp. 497-500), a picture of one of\r\nthose assemblies and its work.  “After the king’s abjuration, and at the\r\nend of the year 1593, the French Huguenots renewed at Mantes their old\r\nunion, and swore to live and die united in their profession of faith.\r\nHenry was in hopes that they would stop short at a religious\r\ndemonstration; but they made it a starting-point for a new political and\r\nmilitary organization on behalf of the Calvinistic party.  They took\r\nadvantage of a general permission granted them by Henry, and met, not in\r\nsynod, but in general assembly, at the town of Sainte Foy, in the month\r\nof June, 1594.  Thereupon they divided all France into nine great\r\nprovinces or circles, composed each of several governments or provinces\r\nof the realm.  Each circle had a separate council, composed of from five\r\nto seven members, and commissioned to fix and apportion the separate\r\nimposts, to keep up a standing army, to collect the supplies necessary\r\nfor the maintenance and defence of the party.  The Calvinistic republic\r\nhad its general assemblies, composed of nine deputies or representatives\r\nfrom each of the nine circles.  These assemblies were invested with\r\nauthority to order, on the general account, all that the juncture\r\nrequired, that is to say, with a legislative power distinct from that of\r\nthe crown and nation.  .  .  .  If the king ceased to pay the sums\r\nnecessary to keep up the garrisons in the towns left to the Reformers,\r\nthe governors were to seize the talliages in the hands of the king’s\r\nreceivers, and apply the money to the payment of the garrisons.  And in\r\ncase the central power should attempt to repress these violent\r\nprocedures, or to substitute as commandant in those places a Catholic for\r\na Protestant, all the Calvinists of the locality and the neighboring\r\ndistricts were to unite and rise in order to give the assistance of the\r\nstrong hand to the Protestant governors so attacked.  Independently of\r\nthe ordinary imposts, a special impost was laid on the Calvinists, and\r\ngave their leaders the disposal of a yearly sum of one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand livres (four hundred and forty thousand francs of the present\r\nday).  The Calvinistic party had thus a territorial area, an\r\nadministration, finances, a legislative power and an executive power\r\nindependent of those of the countr;y; or, in other words, the means of\r\ntaking resolutions contrary to those of the mass of the nation, and of\r\nupholding them by revolt.  All they wanted was a Huguenot stadtholder to\r\noppose to the King of France, and they were looking out for one.”\r\n\r\nHenry IV. did not delude himself as to the tendency of such organization\r\namongst those of his late party.  “He rebuffed very sternly (and\r\nwisely),” says L’Estoile, “those who spoke to him of it.  ‘As for a\r\nprotector,’ he told them, ‘he would have them to understand that there\r\nwas no other protector in France but himself for one side or the other;\r\nthe first man who should be so daring as to assume the title would do so\r\nat the risk of his life; he might be quite certain of that.’”  Had Henry\r\nIV. been permitted to read the secrets of a not so very distant future,\r\nhe might have told the Huguenots of his day that the time was not so far\r\noff when their pretension to political organization and to the formation\r\nof a state within the state, would compromise their religious liberty and\r\nfurnish the absolute government of Louis XIV. with excuses for abolishing\r\nthe protective edict which Henry IV.’s sympathy was on the point of\r\ngranting them, and which, so far as its purely religious provisions went,\r\nwas duly respected by the sagacity of Cardinal Richelieu.\r\n\r\nAfter his conversion to Catholicism, and during the whole of his\r\nreign, it was one of Henry IV.’s constant anxieties to show himself\r\nwell-disposed towards his old friends, and to do for them all he could do\r\nwithout compromising the public peace in France, or abdicating in his own\r\nperson the authority he needed to maintain order and peace.  Some of the\r\nedicts published by his predecessors during the intervals of civil war,\r\nnotably the edict of Poitiers issued by Henry III., had granted the\r\nProtestants free exercise of their worship in the castles of the\r\nCalvinistic lords who had jurisdiction, to the number of thirty-five\r\nhundred, and in the faubourgs of one town or borough of each bailiwick of\r\nthe realm, except the bailiwick of Paris.  Further, the holding of\r\nproperties and heritages, union by marriage with Catholics, and the\r\nadmission of Protestants to the employments, offices, and dignities of\r\nthe realm, were recognized by this edict.  These rights, in black and\r\nwhite, had often been violated by the different authorities, or suspended\r\nduring the wars; Henry IV. maintained them or put them in force again,\r\nand supported the application of them or decreed the extension of them.\r\nIt was calculated that there were in France eight hundred towns and three\r\nhundred bailiwicks or seneschalties; the treaties concluded with the\r\nLeague had expressly prohibited the exercise of Protestant worship in\r\nforty towns and seventeen bailiwicks; Henry IV. tolerated it everywhere\r\nelse.  The prohibition was strict as regarded Paris and ten leagues\r\nround; but, as early as 1594, three months after his entry into Paris,\r\nHenry aided the Reformers in the unostentatious celebration of their own\r\nform in the Faubourg St. Germain; and he authorized the use of it at\r\ncourt for religious ceremonies, especially for marriages.  Three\r\nsuccessive edicts, two issued at Mantes in 1591 and 1593, and the third\r\nat St. Germain in 1597, confirmed and developed these signs of progress\r\nin the path of religious liberty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Castle of St. Germain in the Reign of Henry IV.--107]\r\n\r\nThe Parliaments had in general refused to enregister these decrees a fact\r\nwhich gave them an incomplete and provisional character; but equitable\r\nand persistent measures on the king’s part prevailed upon the Parliament\r\nof Paris to enregister the edict of St. Germain; and the Parliament of\r\nDijon and nearly all the other Parliaments of the kingdom followed this\r\nexample.  One of the principal provisions of this last edict declared\r\nProtestants competent to fill all the offices and dignities of the\r\nkingdom.  It had many times been inserted in preceding edicts, but always\r\nrejected by the Parliaments or formally revoked.  Henry IV. brought it\r\ninto force and credit by putting it extensively in practice, without\r\nentering upon discussion of it and without adding any comment upon it.\r\nIn 1590 he had given Palleseuil the government of Neuchatel in Normandy;\r\nhe had introduced Hurault Dufay, Du Plessis-Mornay and Rosny into the\r\ncouncil of state; in 1594 he had appointed the last a member of the\r\ncouncil of finance; Soffray de Colignon, La Force, Lesdiguieres, and\r\nSancy were summoned to the most important functions; Turenne, in 1594,\r\nwas raised to the dignity of marshal of France; and in 1595 La Tremoille\r\nwas made duke and peer.  They were all Protestants.  Their number and\r\ntheir rank put the matter beyond all dispute; it was a natural\r\nconsequence of the social condition of France; it became an habitual\r\npractice with the government.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the complaints and requirements of the malcontent\r\nProtestants continued, and became day by day more vehement; in 1596 and\r\n1597 the assemblies of Saumur, Loudun, and Vendome became their organs of\r\nexpression; and messengers were sent with them to the camp before La\r\nFere, which Henry IV. was at that time besieging.  He deferred his reply.\r\nTwo of the principal Protestant leaders, the Dukes of Bouillon and La\r\nTremoille, suddenly took extreme measures; they left the king and his\r\narmy, carrying off their troops with them, one to Auvergne and the other\r\nto Poitou.  The deputies from the assembly of Loudun started back again\r\nat the same time, as if for the purpose of giving the word to arm in\r\ntheir provinces.  Du Plessis-Mornay and his wife, the most zealous of the\r\nProtestants who were faithful at the same time to their cause and to the\r\nking, bear witness to this threatening crisis.  “The deputies,” says\r\nMadame du Mornay in her Memoires, “returned each to his own province,\r\nwith the intention of taking the cure of their evils into their own\r\nhands, whence would infallibly have ensued trouble enough to complete the\r\nruin of this state had not the king, by the management of M. du Plessis,\r\nbeen warned of this imminent danger, and by him persuaded to send off and\r\ntreat in good earnest with the said assembly.”  “These gentry, rebuffed\r\nat court,” says Du Plessis-Mornay himself in a letter to the Duke of\r\nBouillon, “have resolved to take the cure into their own hands; to that\r\nend they have been authorized, and by actions which do not seem to lead\r\nthem directly thither they will find that they have passed the Rubicon\r\nright merrily.”  It was as it were a new and a Protestant League just\r\ncoming to a head.  Henry IV. was at that time engaged in the most\r\nimportant negotiation of his reign.  After a long and difficult siege he\r\nhad just retaken.  Amiens.  He thought it a favorable moment at which to\r\ntreat for peace with Spain, and put an end to an onerous war which he had\r\nbeen for so long sustaining.  He informed the Queen of England of his\r\nintention, “begging her, if the position of her affairs did not permit\r\nher to take part in the treaty he was meditating with Spain, to let him\r\nknow clearly what he must do to preserve amity and good understanding\r\nbetween the two crowns, for he would always prefer an ally like her to\r\nreconciled foes such as the Spaniards.”  He addressed the same\r\nnotification to the Dutch government.  Elizabeth on one hand and the\r\nstates-general on the other tried to dissuade him from peace with Spain,\r\nand to get him actively re-engaged in the strife from which they were not\r\ndisposed to emerge.  He persisted in his purpose whilst setting before\r\nthem his reasons for it, and binding himself to second faithfully their\r\nefforts by all pacific means.  A congress was opened in January, 1598, at\r\nVervins in Picardy, through the mediation of Pope Clement VIII., anxious\r\nto become the pacificator of Catholic Europe.  The French\r\nplenipotentiaries, Pomponne de Bellievre and Brulart de Silleri, had\r\ninstructions to obtain the restoration to the king of all towns and\r\nplaces taken by the Spaniards from France since the treaty of peace of\r\nCateau-Cambresis, and to have the Queen of England and the United\r\nProvinces, if they testified a desire for it, included in the treaty, or,\r\nat any rate, to secure for them a truce.  After three months’ conferences\r\nthe treaty of peace was concluded at Vervins on the 2d of May, 1598, the\r\nprincipal condition being, that King Philip II. should restore to France\r\nthe towns of Calais, Ardres, Doullens, Le Catelet, and Blavet; that he\r\nshould re-enter upon possession of the countship of Charolais; and that,\r\nif either of the two sovereigns had any claims to make against one of the\r\nstates their allies in this treaty, “he should prosecute them only by way\r\nof law, before competent judges, and not by force, in any manner\r\nwhatever.”  The Queen of England took no decisive resolution.  When once\r\nthe treaty was concluded, Henry IV., on signing it, said to the Duke of\r\nEpernon, “With this stroke of my pen I have just done more exploits than\r\nI should have done in a long while with the best swords in my kingdom.”\r\n\r\nA month before the conclusion of the treaty of peace at Vervins with\r\nPhilip II., Henry IV. had signed and published at Paris on the 13th of\r\nApril, 1598, the edict of Nantes, his treaty of peace with the Protestant\r\nmalcontents.  This treaty, drawn up in ninety-two open and fifty-six\r\nsecret articles, was a code of old and new laws regulating the civil and\r\nreligious position of Protestants in France, the conditions and\r\nguarantees of their worship, their liberties, and their special\r\nobligations in their relations whether with the crown or with their\r\nCatholic fellow-countrymen.  By this code Henry IV. added a great deal\r\nto the rights of the Protestants and to the duties of the state towards\r\nthem.  Their worship was authorized not only in the castles of the lords\r\nhigh-justiciary, who numbered thirty-five hundred, but also in the\r\ncastles of simple noblemen who enjoyed no high-justiciary rights,\r\nprovided that the number of those present did not exceed thirty.  Two\r\ntowns or two boroughs, instead of one, had the same religious rights in\r\neach bailiwick or seneschalty of the kingdom.  The state was charged with\r\nthe duty of providing for the salaries of the Protestant ministers and\r\nrectors in their colleges or schools, and an annual sum of one hundred\r\nand sixty-five thousand livres of those times (four hundred and\r\nninety-five thousand francs of the present day) was allowed for that\r\npurpose. Donations and legacies to be so applied were authorized.  The\r\nchildren of Protestants were admitted into the universities, colleges,\r\nschools, and hospitals, without distinction between them and Catholics.\r\nThere was great difficulty in securing for them, in all the Parliaments\r\nof the kingdom, impartial justice; and a special chamber, called the\r\nedict-chamber, was instituted for the trial of all causes in which they\r\nwere interested.  Catholic judges could not sit in this chamber unless\r\nwith their consent and on their presentation.  In the Parliaments of\r\nBordeaux, Toulouse, and Grenoble, the edict-chamber was composed of two\r\npresidents, one a Catholic and the other a Reformer, and of twelve\r\ncouncillors, of whom six were Reformers.  The Parliaments had hitherto\r\nrefused to admit Reformers into their midst; in the end the Parliament\r\nof Paris admitted six, one into the edict-chamber and five into the\r\nappeal-chamber (enquetes).  The edict of Nantes retained, at first for\r\neight years and then for four more, in the hands of the Protestants the\r\ntowns which war or treaties had put in their possession, and which\r\nnumbered, it is said, two hundred.  The king was bound to bear the\r\nburden of keeping up their fortifications and paying their garrisons;\r\nand Henry IV.  devoted to that object five hundred and forty thousand\r\nlivres of those times, or about two million francs of our day.  When the\r\nedict thus regulating the position and rights of Protestants was\r\npublished, it was no longer on their part, but on that of the Catholics,\r\nthat lively protests were raised.  Many Catholics violently opposed the\r\nexecution of the new law; they got up processions at Tours to excite the\r\npopulace against the edict, and at Le Mans to induce the Parliament of\r\nNormandy to reject it. The Parliament of Paris put in the way of its\r\nregistration retardations which seemed to forebode a refusal.  Henry\r\nsummoned to the Louvre deputies from all the chambers.  “What I have\r\ndone,” he said to them, “is for the good of peace.  I have made it\r\nabroad; I wish to make it at home. Necessity forced me to this decree.\r\nThey who would prevent it from passing would have war.  You see me in my\r\ncloset.  I speak to you, not in royal robe, or with sword and cape, as\r\nmy predecessors did, nor as a prince receiving an embassy, but as a\r\nfather of a family in his doublet conversing familiarly with his\r\nchildren.  It is said that I am minded to favor them of the religion;\r\nthere is a mind to entertain some mistrust of me.  .  .  .  I know that\r\ncabals have been got up in the Parliament, that seditious preachers have\r\nbeen set on.  .  .  .  The preachers utter words by way of doctrine for\r\nto build up rather than pull down sedition.  That is the road formerly,\r\ntaken to the making of barricades, and to proceeding by degrees to the\r\nparricide of the late king.  I will cut the roots of all these factions;\r\nI will make short work of those who foment them.  I have scaled the\r\nwalls of cities; you may be sure I shall scale barricades.  You must\r\nconsider that what I am doing is for a good purpose, and let my past\r\nbehavior go bail for it.”\r\n\r\nParliaments and Protestants, all saw that they had to do not only with a\r\nstrong-willed king, but with a judicious and clearsighted man, a true\r\nFrench patriot, who was sincerely concerned for the public interest, and\r\nwho had won his spurs in the art of governing parties by making for each\r\nits own place in the state.  It was scarcely five years ago that the king\r\nwho was now publishing the edict of Nantes had become a Catholic; the\r\nParliaments enregistered the decree.  The Protestant malcontents resigned\r\nthemselves to the necessity of being content with it.  Whatever their\r\nimperfections and the objections that might be raised to them, the peace\r\nof Vervins and the edict of Narrtes were, amidst the obstacles and perils\r\nencountered at every step by the government of Henry IV., the two most\r\ntimely and most beneficial acts in the world for France.\r\n\r\nFour months after the conclusion of the treaty of Vervins, on the 13th of\r\nSeptember, 1598, Philip II. died at the Escurial, “prison, cloister, and\r\ntomb all in one,” as M. Rosseeuw St. Hilaire very well remarks [_Histoire\r\nd’Espagne,_ t. x.  pp. 335-363], situated eight leagues from Madrid.\r\nPhilip was so ill, and so cruelly racked by gout and fever, that it was\r\ndoubted whether he could be removed thither; “but a collection of relics,\r\namassed by his orders in Germany, had just arrived at the Escurial, and\r\nthe festival of consecration was to take place within a few days.  ‘I\r\ndesire that I be borne alive thither where my tomb already is,’ said\r\nPhilip.”  He was laid in a litter borne by men who walked at a snail’s\r\npace, in order to avoid all shaking.  Forced to halt every instant, he\r\ntook six days to do the eight leagues which separated him from his last\r\nresting-place.  There he died in atrocious agonies, and after a very\r\npainful operation, endured with unalterable courage and calmness; he had\r\nordered to be placed in front of his bed the bier in which his body was\r\nto lie and the crucifix which his father, Charles V., at his death in the\r\nmonastery of Yuste, had held in his hand.  During a reign of forty-two\r\nyears Philip II. was, systematically and at any price, on the score of\r\nwhat he regarded as the divine right of the Catholic church and of his\r\nown kingship, the patron of absolute power in Europe.  Earnest and\r\nsincere in his faith, licentious without open scandal in his private\r\nlife, unscrupulous and pitiless in the service of the religious and\r\npolitical cause he had embraced, he was capable of any lie, one might\r\nalmost say of any crime, without having his conscience troubled by it.\r\nA wicked man and a frightful example of what a naturally cold and hard\r\nspirit may become when it is a prey to all the temptations of despotism\r\nand to two sole passions, egotism and fanaticism.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Philip II. and during the first years of the reign of\r\nhis son Philip III., war continued between Spain on one side, and\r\nEngland, the United Provinces, and the German Protestants on the other,\r\nbut languidly and without any results to signify.  Henry IV. held aloof\r\nfrom the strife, all the while permitting his Huguenot subjects to take\r\npart in it freely and at their own risks.  On the 3d of April, 1603,\r\na second great royal personage, Queen Elizabeth, disappeared from the\r\nscene. She had been, as regards the Protestantism of Europe, what Philip\r\nII. had been, as regards Catholicism, a powerful and able patron; but,\r\nwhat Philip II. did from fanatical conviction, Elizabeth did from\r\npatriotic feeling; she had small faith in Calvinistic doctrines, and no\r\nliking for Puritanic sects; the Catholic church, the power of the pope\r\nexcepted, was more to her mind than the Anglican church, and her private\r\npreferences differed greatly from her public practices.  Besides, she\r\ncombined with the exigencies of a king’s position the instincts of a\r\nwoman; she had the vanities rather than the weaknesses of one; she would\r\nfain have inspired and responded to the passions natural to one; but\r\npolicy always had the dominion over her sentiments without extinguishing\r\nthem, and the proud sovereign sent to the block the overweening and\r\nalmost rebel subject whom she afterwards grievously regretted.  These\r\ninconsistent resolutions and emotions caused Elizabeth’s life to be one\r\nof agitation, though without warmth, and devoid of serenity as of\r\nsweetness.  And so, when she grew old, she was disgusted with it and\r\nweary of it; she took no pleasure any more in thing or person; she could\r\nno longer bear herself, either in her court or in her bed or elsewhere;\r\nshe decked herself out to lie stretched upon cushions and there remain\r\nmotionless, casting about her vague glances which seemed to seek after\r\nthat for which she did not ask.  She ended by repelling her physicians\r\nand even refusing nourishment.  When her ministers saw her thus, almost\r\ninsensible and dying, they were emboldened to remind her of what she had\r\nsaid to them one day at White-Hall, “My throne must be a king’s throne.”\r\n At this reminder she seemed to rouse herself, and repeated the same\r\nwords, adding, “I will not have a rascal (vaurien) to succeed me.”  Sir\r\nRobert Cecil asked her what she meant by that expression.  “I tell you\r\nthat I must have a king to succeed me; who can that be but my cousin of\r\nScotland?”  After having indicated the King of Scotland, James Stuart,\r\nson of the fair rival whom she had sent to the block, Elizabeth remained\r\nspeechless.  The Archbishop of Canterbury commenced praying, breaking off\r\nat intervals; twice the queen signed to him to go on.  Her advisers\r\nreturned in the evening, and begged her to indicate to them by signs if\r\nshe were still of the same mind; she raised her arms and crossed them\r\nabove her head.  Then she seemed to fall into a dreamy state.  At three\r\no’clock, during the night, she quietly passed away.  Some few hours\r\nafterwards, her counsellors in assembly resolved to proclaim James\r\nStuart, King of Scotland, King of England, as the nearest of kin to the\r\nlate queen, and indicated by her on her death-bed.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century Henry IV. was the only one\r\nremaining of the three great sovereigns who, during the sixteenth, had\r\ndisputed, as regarded religion and politics, the preponderance in Europe.\r\nHe had succeeded in all his kingly enterprises; he had become a Catholic\r\nin France without ceasing to be the prop of the Protestants in Europe;\r\nhe had made peace with Spain without embroiling himself with England,\r\nHolland, and Lutheran Germany.  He had shot up, as regarded ability and\r\ninfluence, in the eyes of all Europe.  It was just then that he gave the\r\nstrongest proof of his great judgment and political sagacity; he was not\r\nintoxicated with success; he did not abuse his power; he did not aspire\r\nto distant conquests or brilliant achievements; he concerned himself\r\nchiefly with the establishment of public order in his kingdom and with\r\nhis people’s prosperity.  His well-known saying, “I want all my peasantry\r\nto have a fowl in the pot every Sunday,” was a desire worthy of Louis\r\nXII.  Henry IV. had a sympathetic nature; his grandeur did not lead him\r\nto forget the nameless multitudes whose fate depended upon his\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nHe had, besides, the rich, productive, varied, inquiring mind of one who\r\ntook an interest not only in the welfare of the French peasantry, but in\r\nthe progress of the whole French community, progress agricultural,\r\nindustrial, commercial, scientific, and literary.  The conversation of an\r\nindependent thinker like Montaigne had, at the least, as much attraction\r\nfor him as that of his comrades in arms.  Long before Henry IV. was King\r\nof France, on the 19th of December, 1584, Montaigne, wrote, “The King of\r\nNavarre came to see me at Montaigne where he had never been before, and\r\nwas there two days, attended by my people without any of his own\r\nofficers; he permitted neither tasting (essai) nor state-banquet\r\n(couvert), and slept in my bed.”  On the 24th of October, 1587, after\r\nwinning the battle of Contras, Henry stopped to dine at Montaigne’s\r\nhouse, though its possessor had remained faithful to Henry III., whose\r\ntroops had just lost the battle; and on the 18th of January, 1590, when\r\nthe King of Navarre, now become King of France, besieged and took the\r\ntown of Lisieux, Montaigne wrote to him, “All the time through, sir, I\r\nhave observed in you this same fortune that is now yours; and you may\r\nremember that even when I had to make confession thereof to my\r\nparish-priest I did not omit to regard your successes with a kindly eye.\r\nNow, with more reason and freedom, I hug them to my heart.  Yonder they\r\ndo you service by effects; but they do you no less service here by\r\nreputation.  The report goes as far as the shot.  We could not derive\r\nfrom the justice of your cause arguments so powerful in sustaining or\r\nreducing your subjects as we do from the news of the prosperity of your\r\nenterprises.”\r\n\r\nAbroad the policy of Henry IV. was as judicious and far sighted as it was\r\njust and sympathetic at home.  There has been much writing and\r\ndissertation about what has been called his grand design.  This name has\r\nbeen given to a plan for the religious and political organization of\r\nChristendom, consisting in the division of Europe amongst three\r\nreligions, the Catholic, the Calvinistic, and the Lutheran, and into\r\nfifteen states, great and small, monarchical or republican, with equal\r\nrights, alone recognized as members of the Christian confederation,\r\nregulating in concert their common affairs, and pacifically making up\r\ntheir differences, whilst all the while preserving their national\r\nexistence.  This plan is lengthily and approvingly set forth, several\r\ntimes over, in the _OEconomies royales,_ which Sully’s secretaries wrote\r\nat his suggestion, and probably sometimes at his dictation.  Henry IV.\r\nwas a prince as expansive in ideas as he was inventive, who was a master\r\nof the art of pleasing, and himself took great pleasure in the freedom\r\nand unconstraint of conversation.  No doubt the notions of the grand\r\ndesign often came into his head, and he often talked about them to Sully,\r\nhis confidant in what he thought as well as in what he did.  Sully, for\r\nhis part was a methodical spirit, a regular downright putter in practice,\r\nevidently struck and charmed by the richness and grandeur of the\r\nprospects placed before his eyes by his king, and feeling pleasure in\r\nshedding light upon them whilst giving them a more positive and more\r\ncomplete shape than belonged to their first and original appearance.\r\nAnd thus came down to us the grand design, which, so far as Henry IV. was\r\nconcerned, was never a definite project.  His true external policy was\r\nmuch more real and practical.  He had seen and experienced the evils of\r\nreligious hatred and persecution.  He had been a great sufferer from the\r\nsupremacy of the house of Austria in Europe, and he had for a long while\r\nopposed it.  When he became the most puissant and most regarded of\r\nEuropean kings, he set his heart very strongly on two things--toleration\r\nfor the three religions which had succeeded in establishing themselves in\r\nEurope and showing themselves capable of contending one against another,\r\nand the abasement of the house of Austria, which, even after the death of\r\nCharles V. and of Philip II., remained the real and the formidable rival\r\nof France.  The external policy of Henry from the treaty of Vervins to\r\nhis death, was religious peace in Europe and the alliance of Catholic\r\nFrance with Protestant England and Germany against Spain and Austria.  He\r\nshowed constant respect and deference towards the papacy, a power highly\r\nregarded in both the rival camps, though much fallen from the substantial\r\nimportance it had possessed in Europe during the middle ages.  French\r\npolicy striving against Spanish policy, such was the true and the only\r\nserious characteristic of the grand design.\r\n\r\nFour men, very unequal in influence as well as merit, Sully, Villeroi,\r\nDu Plessis-Mornay, and D’Aubigne, did Henry IV. effective service, by\r\nvery different processes and in very different degrees, towards\r\nestablishing and rendering successful this internal and external policy.\r\nThree were Protestants; Villeroi alone was a Catholic.  Sully is beyond\r\ncomparison with the other three.  He is the only one whom Henry IV.\r\ncalled my friend; the only one who had participated in all the life and\r\nall the government of Henry IV., his evil as well as his exalted\r\nfortunes, his most painful embarrassments at home as well as his greatest\r\npolitical acts; the only one whose name has remained inseparably\r\nconnected with that of a master whom he served without servility as well\r\nas without any attempt to domineer.  There is no idea of entering here\r\nupon his personal history; we would only indicate his place in that of\r\nhis king.  Maximilian de Bethune-Rosny, born in 1559, and six years\r\nyounger than Henry of Navarre, was barely seventeen when in 1576 he\r\nattended Henry on his flight from the court of France to go and recover\r\nin Navarre his independence of position and character.  Rosny was content\r\nat first to serve him as a volunteer, “in order,” he said, “to learn the\r\nprofession of arms from its first rudiments.”  He speedily did himself\r\nhonor in several actions.  In 1580 the King of Navarre took him as\r\nchamberlain and counsellor.  On becoming King of France, Henry IV., in\r\n1594, made him secretary of state; in 1596, put him on the council of\r\nfinance; in 1597, appointed him grand surveyor of France, and, in 1599,\r\nsuperintendent-general of finance and master of the ordnance.  In 1602 he\r\nwas made Marquis de Rosny and councillor of honor in the Parliament; then\r\ngovernor of the Bastille, superintendent of fortifications, and surveyor\r\nof Paris; in 1603, governor of Poitou.  Lastly, in 1606, his estate of\r\nSully-sur-Loire was raised to a duchy-peerage, and he was living under\r\nthis name, which has become his historical name, when, in 1610, the\r\nassassination of Henry IV. sent into retirement, for thirty-one years,\r\nthe confidant of all his thoughts and the principal minister of a reign\r\nwhich, independently of the sums usefully expended for the service of the\r\nstate and the advancement of public prosperity, had extinguished,\r\naccording to the most trustworthy evidence, two hundred and thirty-five\r\nmillions of debts, and which left in the coffers of the state, in ready\r\nmoney or in safe securities, forty-three million, one hundred and\r\nthirty-eight thousand, four hundred and ninety livres.\r\n\r\nNicholas de Neufville, Lord of Villeroi, who was born in 1543, and whose\r\ngrandfather had been secretary of state under Francis I., was, whilst\r\nHenry III. was still reigning, member of a small secret council at which\r\nall questions relating to Protestants were treated of.  Though a strict\r\nCatholic, and convinced that the King of France ought to be openly in the\r\nranks of the Catholics, and to govern with their support, he sometimes\r\ngave Henry III. some free-spoken and wise counsels.  When he saw him\r\nspending his time with the brotherhoods of penitents whose head he had\r\ndeclared himself, “Sir,” said he, “debts and obligations are considered\r\naccording to dates, and therefore old debts ought to be paid before new\r\nones.  You were King of France before you were head of the brotherhoods;\r\nyour conscience binds you to render to the kingship that which you owe it\r\nrather than to the fraternity that which you have promised it.  You can\r\nexcuse yourself from one, but not from the other.  You only wear the\r\nsackcloth when you please, but you have the crown always on your head.”\r\n When the wars of religion broke out, when the League took form and Henry\r\nde Guise had been assassinated at Blois, Villeroi, naturally a Leaguer\r\nand a moderate Leaguer, became the immediate adviser of the Duke of\r\nMayenne.  After Henry III.’s death, as soon as he heard that Henry IV.\r\npromised to have himself instructed in the Catholic religion, he\r\nannounced his intention of recognizing him if he held to this engagement;\r\nand he held to his own, for he was during five years the intermediary\r\nbetween Henry IV. and Mayenne, incessantly laboring to reconcile them,\r\nand to prevent the estates of the League from giving the crown of France\r\nto a Spanish princess.  Villeroi was a Leaguer of the patriotically\r\nFrench type.  And so Henry IV., as soon as he was firm upon his throne,\r\nsummoned him to his councils, and confided to him the direction of\r\nforeign affairs.  The late Leaguer sat beside Sully, and exerted himself\r\nto give the prevalence, in Henry IV.’s external policy, to Catholic\r\nmaxims and alliances, whilst Sully, remaining firmly Protestant in the\r\nservice of his king turned Catholic, continued to be in foreign matters\r\nthe champion of Protestant policy and alliances.  There was thus seen,\r\nduring the sixteenth century, in the French monarchy, a phenomenon which\r\nwas to repeat itself during the eighteenth in the republic of the United\r\nStates of America, when, in 1789, its president, Washington, summoned to\r\nhis cabinet Hamilton and Jefferson together, one the stanchest of the\r\naristocratic federalists and the other the warm defender of democratic\r\nprinciples and tendencies.  Washington, in his lofty and calm\r\nimpartiality, considered that, to govern the nascent republic, he had\r\nneed of both; and he found a way, in fact, to make both of service to\r\nhim.  Henry IV. had perceived himself to be in an analogous position with\r\nFrance and Europe divided between Catholics and Protestants, whom he\r\naspired to pacificate.\r\n\r\nHe likewise succeeded.  An incomplete success, however, as generally.\r\nhappens when the point attained is an adjournment of knotty questions\r\nwhich war has vainly attempted to cut, and the course of ideas and events\r\nhas not yet had time to unravel.\r\n\r\nHenry IV.  made so great a case of Villeroi’s co-operation and influence,\r\nthat, without loving him as he loved Sully, he upheld him and kept him as\r\nsecretary of state for foreign affairs to the end of his reign.  He\r\nprecisely defined his peculiar merit when he said, “Princes have servants\r\nof all values and all sorts; some do their own business before that of\r\ntheir master; others do their master’s and do not forget their own; but\r\nVilleroi believes that his master’s business is his own, and he bestows\r\nthereon the same zeal that another does in pushing his own suit or\r\nlaboring at his own vine.”  Though short and frigidly written, the\r\nMemoires of Villeroi give, in fact, the idea of a man absorbed in his\r\ncommission and regarding it as his own business as well as that of his\r\nking and country.\r\n\r\nPhilip du Plessis-Mornay occupied a smaller place than Sully and Villeroi\r\nin the government of Henry IV.; but he held and deserves to keep a great\r\none in the history of his times.  He was the most eminent and also the\r\nmost moderate of the men of profound piety and conviction of whom the\r\nReformation had made a complete conquest, soul and body, and who placed\r\ntheir public fidelity to their religious creed above every other interest\r\nand every other affair in this world.  He openly blamed and bitterly\r\ndeplored Henry IV.’s conversion to Catholicism, but he did not ignore the\r\nweighty motives for it; his disapproval and his vexation did not make him\r\nforget the great qualities of his king or the services he was rendering\r\nFrance, or his own duty and his earlier feelings towards him.  This\r\nunbending Protestant, who had contributed as much as anybody to put\r\nHenry IV. on the throne, who had been admitted further than anybody,\r\nexcept Sully, to his intimacy, who ever regretted that his king had\r\nabandoned his faith, who braved all perils and all disgraces to keep and\r\nmaintain his own, this Mornay, malcontent, saddened, all but banished\r\nfrom court, assailed by his friends’ irritation and touched by their\r\nsufferings, never took part against the king whom he blamed, and of whom\r\nhe thought he had to complain, in any faction or any intrigue; on the\r\ncontrary, he remained unshakably faithful to him, incessantly striving to\r\nmaintain or re-establish in the Protestant church in France some little\r\norder and peace, and between the Protestants and Henry IV. some little\r\nmutual confidence and friendliness.  Mornay had made up his mind to serve\r\nforever a king who had saved his country.  He remained steadfast and\r\nactive in his creed, but without falling beneath the yoke of any\r\nnarrow-minded idea, preserving his patriotic good sense in the midst of\r\nhis fervent piety, and bearing with sorrowful constancy his friends’\r\nbursts of anger and his king’s exhibitions of ingratitude. Between 1597\r\nand 1605 three incidents supervened which put to the proof Henry IV.’s\r\nfeelings towards his old and faithful servant.  In October, 1597, Mornay,\r\nstill governor of Saumur, had gone to Angers to concert plans with\r\nMarshal de Brissac for an expedition which, by order of the king, they\r\nwere to make into Brittany against the Duke of Mercoeur, not yet reduced\r\nto submission.  As he was passing along the street with only three or\r\nfour of his men, he was unexpectedly attacked by one Sieur de Saint-Phal,\r\nwho, after calling upon him to give some explanation as to a disagreement\r\nthat had taken place between them five months before, brutally struck him\r\na blow on the head with a stick, knocked him down, immediately mounted a\r\nhorse that was held all ready on the spot, and fled in haste, leaving\r\nMornay in the hands of ten or a dozen accomplices, who dealt him several\r\nsword-thrusts as he was rising to defend himself, and who, in their turn,\r\nfled.  Some passers-by hurried up; Mornay’s wounds were found to be\r\nslight; but the affair, which nobody hesitated to call murder, made a\r\ngreat noise; there was general indignation; the king was at once informed\r\nof it; and whilst the question was being discussed at Saumur whether\r\nMornay ought to seek reparation by way of arms or by that of law, Henry\r\nIV. wrote to him in his own hand on the 8th of November, 1597:--\r\n\r\n“M. du Plessis: I am extremely displeased at the outrage you have met\r\nwith, wherein I participate both as king and as your friend.  As the\r\nformer I will do you justice and myself too.  If I bore only the second\r\ntitle, you have none whose sword would be more ready to leap from its\r\nscabbard than mine, or who would put his life at your service more\r\ncheerfully than I.  Take this for granted, that, in effect, I will render\r\nyou the offices of king, master, and friend.  And on this truthful\r\nassurance, I conclude, praying God to have you in His holy keeping.”\r\n\r\nSaint-Phal remained for a long while concealed in the very district,\r\namongst his relatives; but on the 12th of January, 1599, he was arrested\r\nand put in the Bastille; and, according to the desire of Mornay himself,\r\nthe king decided that he should be brought before him, unarmed, should\r\nplace one knee on the ground, should ask his pardon, and then, assuming\r\nhis arms, should accordingly receive that pardon, first of all from\r\nMornay, whom the king had not permitted to exact in another way the\r\nreparation due to him, and afterwards from the mouth of the king himself,\r\ntogether with a severe admonition to take heed to himself for the future.\r\nThe affair having thus terminated, there was no more heard of Saint-Phal,\r\nand Mornay returned to Saumur with a striking mark of the king’s\r\nsympathy, who, in his own words, had felt pleasure “in avenging him as\r\nking and as friend.”\r\n\r\nThe second incident was of more political consequence, and neither the\r\nking nor Mornay conducted themselves with sufficient discretion and\r\ndignity.  In July, 1598, Mornay published a treatise on the institution\r\nof the eucharist in the Christian church, how and by what degrees the\r\nmass was introduced in its place.  It was not only an attack upon the\r\nfundamental dogma and cult of the Catholic church; the pope was expressly\r\nstyled Antichrist in it.  Clement VIII. wrote several times about it to\r\nHenry IV., complaining that a man of such high standing in the government\r\nand in the king’s regard should treat so insultingly a sovereign in\r\nalliance with the king, and head of the church to which the king\r\nbelonged.  The pope’s complaint came opportunely.  Henry IV. was at this\r\ntime desirous of obtaining from the court of Rome annulment of his\r\nmarriage with Marguerite de Valois, that he might be enabled to contract\r\nanother; he did not as yet say with whom.  Mornay’s book was vigorously\r\nattacked, not only in point of doctrine, but in point of fact; he was\r\ncharged with having built his foundation upon a large number of\r\nmisquotations; and the Bishop of Evreux, M. du Perron, a great friend of\r\nthe king’s, whom he had always supported and served, said that he was\r\nprepared to point out as such nearly five hundred.  The dispute grew warm\r\nbetween the two theologians; Mornay demanded leave to prove the falsehood\r\nof the accusation; the bishop accepted the challenge.  For all his\r\ndefence of his book and his erudition, Mornay did not show any great\r\nhurry to enter upon the contest; and, on the other hand, the bishop\r\nreduced the number of the quotations against which he objected.  The sum\r\ntotal of the quotations found fault with was fixed at sixty.  A\r\nconference was summoned to look into them, and six commissioners, three\r\nCatholic and three Protestant, were appointed to give judgment; De Thou\r\nand Pithou amongst the former, Dufresne la Canaye and Casaubon amongst\r\nthe latter.  Erudition was worthily represented there, and there was\r\nevery probability of justice.  The conference met on the 4th of May,\r\n1600, at Fontainebleau, in presence of the king and many great lords,\r\nmagistrates, ecclesiastics, and distinguished spectators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Castle of Fontainbleau----124]\r\n\r\nMornay began by owning that “out of four thousand quotations made by him\r\nit was unlikely that some would not be found wherein he might have erred,\r\nas he was human, but he was quite sure that it was never in bad faith.”\r\n He then said that, being pressed for time, he had not yet been able to\r\ncollate more than nineteen out of the sixty quotations specially\r\nattacked.  Of these nineteen nine only were examined at this first\r\nconference, and nearly all were found to be incorrect.  Next day, Mornay\r\nwas taken “with a violent seizure and repeated attacks of vomiting, which\r\nM. de la Riviere, the king’s premier physician, came and deposed to.”\r\n The conference was broken off, and not resumed afterwards.  The king\r\ncongratulated himself beyond measure at the result, and even on the part\r\nwhich he had taken.  “Tell the truth,” said he to the Bishop of Evreux,\r\n“the good right had good need of aid;” and he wrote, on the 6th of May to\r\nthe Duke of Epernon, “The diocese of Evreux has beaten that of Saumur.\r\nThe bearer was present, and will tell you that I did wonders.  Assuredly\r\nit is one of the greatest hits for the church of God that have been made\r\nfor some time.”  He evidently had it very much at heart that the pope\r\nshould be well informed of what had taken place, and feel obliged to him\r\nfor it.  “Haven’t you wits to see that the king, in order to gratify the\r\npope, has been pleased to sacrifice my father’s honor at his feet?”  said\r\nyoung Philip de Mornay to some courtiers who were speaking to him about\r\nthis sad affair.  This language was reported to the king, who showed\r\nhimself much hurt by it.  “He is a young man beside himself with grief,”\r\n they said, “and it is his own father’s case.”  “Young he is not,” replied\r\nthe king; “he is forty years old, twenty in age and twenty from his\r\nfather’s teaching.”  The king’s own circle and his most distinguished\r\nservants gladly joined in his self-congratulation.  “Well,” he said to\r\nSully, “what think you of your pope?”  “I think, sir,” answered Sully,\r\n“that he is more pope than you suppose; cannot you see that he gives a\r\nred hat to M. d’Evreux?  Really, I never saw a man so dumbfounded, or one\r\nwho defended himself so ill.  If our religion had no better foundation\r\nthan his crosswise legs and arms (Mornay habitually kept them so), I\r\nwould abandon it rather to-day than to-morrow.”  [_OEconomies royales,_\r\nt. iii.  p. 346.]\r\n\r\nSully desired nothing better than to find Mornay at fault, and to see the\r\nking fully convinced of it.  Jealousy is nowhere more wide-awake and more\r\nimplacable than at courts.  However, amongst the grandees present at the\r\nconference of Fontainebleau there were some who did not share the general\r\nimpression.  “I saw there,” said the Duke of Mayenne as he went away from\r\nit, “only a very old and very faithful servant very badly paid for so\r\nmany services;” and, in spite of the king’s letter, the Duke of Epernon\r\nsent word to Mornay that he still took him for a gentleman of honor, and\r\nstill remained his friend.  Henry IV. himself, with his delicate and\r\nready tact, was not slow to perceive that he had gone too far and had\r\nbehaved badly.  Being informed that Mornay was in deep suffering, he sent\r\nto him M. de LomLnie, his cabinet-secretary, to fully assure him that the\r\nking would ever be his good master and friend.  “As for master,” said\r\nMornay, “I am only too sensible of it; as for friend, he belongs not to\r\nme: I have known men to make attempts upon the king’s life, honor, and\r\nstate, nay, upon his very bed; against them, the whole of them, he never\r\ndisplayed so much severity as against me alone, who have done him service\r\nall my life.”  And he set out on his way back to Saumur without seeing\r\nthe king again.\r\n\r\nHe returned thither with all he had dearest in the world, his wife,\r\nCharlotte Arbaleste de la Borde, his worthy partner in all his trials--\r\ntrials of prosperity as well as adversity.  She has full right to a few\r\nlines in this History, for it was she who preserved to us, in her\r\n_Memoires,_ the picture, so salutary to contemplate, of the life and\r\ncharacter of Mornay, in the midst of his friends’ outbursts of passion\r\nand his adversaries’ brutal exhibitions of hatred.  As intelligent as she\r\nwas devoted, she gave him aid in his theological studies and labors as\r\nwell as in the confronting of public events.  “During this expedition to\r\nFontainebleau, I had remained,” she says, “at Paris, in extreme\r\napprehension, recently recovered from a severe illness, harassed by the\r\ndeadlock in our domestic affairs.  And, as for all that, I felt it not in\r\ncomparison with the inevitable mishap of this expedition.  I had found\r\nfor M. du Plessis all the books of which he might possibly have need,\r\nhunted up, with great diligence considering the short time, in the\r\nlibraries of all our friends, and I got them into his hands, but somewhat\r\nlate in the day, because it was too late in the day when he gave me the\r\ncommission.”  The private correspondence of these two noble persons is a\r\nfine example of conjugal and Christian union, virtue, and affection.  In\r\n1605, their only son, Philip de Mornay, a very distinguished young man,\r\nthen twenty-six years of age, obtained Henry IV.’s authority to go and\r\nserve in the army of the Prince of Orange, Maurice of Nassau, at deadly\r\nwar with Spain.  He was killed in it on the 23d of October, at the\r\nassault upon the town of Gueldres.  On receiving news of his death,\r\n“I have now no son,” said his father; “therefore I have now no wife.”\r\n His sorrowful prediction was no delusion; six mouths after her son’s\r\ndeath Madame de Mornay succumbed, unable any longer to bear the burden\r\nshe was supporting without a murmur.  Her Memoires concludes with this\r\nexpression: “It is but reasonable that this my book should end with him,\r\nas it was only undertaken to describe to him our pilgrimage in this life.\r\nAnd, since it hath pleased God, he hath sooner gone through, and more\r\neasily ended his own.  Wherefore, indeed, if I feared not to cause\r\naffliction to M. du Plessis, who, the more mine grows upon me, makes me\r\nthe more clearly perceive his affection, it would vex me extremely to\r\nsurvive him.”\r\n\r\nOn learning by letter from Prince Maurice that the young man was dead,\r\nHenry IV. said, with emotion, to those present, “I have lost the fairest\r\nhope of a gentleman in my kingdom.  I am grieved for the father.  I must\r\nsend and comfort him.  No father but he could have such a loss.”  “He\r\ndespatched on the instant,” says Madame de Mornay herself, “Sieur\r\nBruneau, one of his secretaries, with very gracious letters to comfort\r\nus; with orders, nevertheless, not to present himself unless he were sure\r\nthat we already knew of it otherwise, not wishing to be the first to tell\r\nus such sad news.”  [_Memoires,_ t. ii.  p. 107.] This touching evidence\r\nof a king’s sympathy for a father’s grief effaced, no doubt, to some\r\nextent in Mornay’s mind his reminiscences of the conference at\r\nFontainebleau; one thing is quite certain, that he continued to render\r\nHenry IV., in the synods and political assemblies of the Protestants, his\r\nusual good offices for the maintenance or re-establishment of peace and\r\ngood understanding between the Catholic king and his malcontent former\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nA third Protestant, Theodore Agrippa d’Aubigne, grandfather of Madame de\r\nMaintenon, has been reckoned here amongst not the councillors, certainly,\r\nbut the familiar and still celebrated servants of Henry IV.  He held no\r\ngreat post, and had no great influence with the king; he was, on every\r\noccasion, a valiant soldier, a zealous Protestant, an indefatigable lover\r\nand seeker of adventure, sometimes an independent thinker, frequently an\r\neloquent and bold speaker, always a very sprightly companion.  Henry IV.\r\nat one time employed him, at another held aloof from him, or forgot him,\r\nor considered him a mischief-maker, a faction-monger who must be put in\r\nthe Bastille, and against whom, if it seemed good, there would be enough\r\nto put him on his trial.  Madame de Chatillon, who took an interest in\r\nD’Aubigne, warned him of the danger, and urged him to depart that very\r\nevening.  “I will think about it, madame,” said he; “I will implore God’s\r\nassistance, and I will see what I have to do.”  .  .  .  “The inspiration\r\nthat came to me,” says he, “was to go next morning very early to see his\r\nMajesty, and, after having briefly set before him my past services, to\r\nask him for a pension, which up to that time I had not felt inclined to\r\ndo.  The king, surprised, and at the same time well pleased to observe a\r\nsomething mercenary behind all my proud spirit, embraced me, and granted\r\non the spot what I asked of him.”  The next day D’Aubigne went to the\r\nArsenal; Sully invited him to dinner, and took him to see the Bastille,\r\nassuring him that there was no longer any danger for him, but only since\r\nthe last twenty-four hours.  [_La France Protestante,_ by MM. Haag,\r\nt. i.  p. 170.]  If D’Aubigne had not been a writer, he would be\r\ncompletely forgotten by this time, like so many other intriguing and\r\nturbulent adventurers, who make a great deal of fuss themselves, and try\r\nto bring everything about them into a fuss as long as they live, and who\r\ndie without leaving any trace of their career.  But D’Aubigne wrote a\r\ngreat deal both in prose and in verse; he wrote the _Histoire\r\nuniverselle_ of his times, personal _Memoires,_ tales, tragedies, and\r\ntheological and satirical essays; and he wrote with sagacious,\r\npenetrating, unpremeditated wit, rare vigor, and original and almost\r\nprofound talent for discerning and depicting situations and characters.\r\nIt is the writer which has caused the man to live, and has assigned him a\r\nplace in French literature even more than in French history.  We purpose\r\nto quote two fragments of his, which will make us properly understand and\r\nappreciate both the writer and the man.  During the civil war, in the\r\nreign of Henry III., D’Aubigne had made himself master of the Island of\r\nOleron, had fortified it, and considered himself insufficiently rewarded\r\nby the King of Navarre, to whom he had meant to render, and had, in fact,\r\nrendered service.  After the battle of Coutras, in 1587, he was sleeping\r\nwith a comrade named Jacques de Caumont la Force, in the wardrobe of the\r\nchamber in which the King of Navarre slept.  “La Force,” said D’Aubigne\r\nto his bed-fellow, “our master is a regular miser, and the most\r\nungrateful mortal on the face of the earth.”  “What dost say, D’Aubigne?”\r\n asked La Force, half asleep.  “He says,” repeated the King of Navarre,\r\nwho had heard all, that I am a regular miser, and the most ungrateful\r\nmortal on the face of the earth.”  D’Aubigne, somewhat disconcerted, was\r\nmum.  “But,” he adds, “when daylight appeared, this prince, who liked\r\nneither rewarding nor punishing, did not for all that look any the more\r\nblack at me, or give me a quarter-crown more.”  Thirty years later, in\r\n1617, after the collapse of the League and after the reign of Henry IV.,\r\nD’Aubigne, wishing to describe the two leaders of the two great parties,\r\nsums them up in these terms: “The Duke of Mayenne had such probity as is\r\nhuman, a good nature and a liberality which made him most pleasant to\r\nthose about him; his was a judicious mind, which made good use of\r\nexperience, took the measure of everything by the card; a courage rather\r\nsteady than dashing; take him for all in all, he might be called an\r\nexcellent captain.  King Henry IV. had all this, save the liberality; but\r\nto make up for that item, his rank caused expectations as to the future\r\nto blossom, which made the hardships of the present go down.  He had,\r\namongst his points of superiority to the Duke of Mayenne, a marvellous\r\ngift of promptitude and vivacity, and far beyond the average.  We have\r\nseen him, a thousand times in his life, make pat replies without hearing\r\nthe purport of a request, and forestall questions without committing\r\nhimself.  The Duke of Mayenne was incommoded by his great bodily bulk,\r\nwhich could not support the burden either of arms or of fatigue duty.\r\nThe other, having worked all his men to a stand-still, would send for\r\nhounds and horses for to begin a hunt; and when his horses could go no\r\nfarther, he would run down the game afoot.  The former communicated his\r\nheaviness and his maladies to his army, undertaking no enterprise that he\r\ncould not support in person; the other communicated his own liveliness to\r\nthose about him, and his captains imitated him from complaisance and from\r\nemulation.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GABRIELLE D’ESTREES--130]\r\n\r\nThese politicians, these Christians, these warriors had, in 1600, a grave\r\nquestion to solve for Henry IV., and grave counsel to give him.  He was\r\nanxious to separate from his wife, Marguerite de Valois, who had, in\r\nfact, been separated from him for the last fifteen years, was leading a\r\nvery irregular life, and had not brought him any children.  But, in order\r\nto obtain from the pope annulment of the marriage, it was first necessary\r\nthat Marguerite should consent to it, and at no price would she consent\r\nso long as the king’s favorite continued to be Gabrielle d’Estrees, whom\r\nshe detested, and by whom Henry already had several children.  The\r\nquestion arose in in 1598, in connection with a son lately born to\r\nGabrielle, who was constantly spreading reports that she would be the\r\nking’s wife.  To give consistency to this report she took it into her\r\nhead to have her son presented at baptism as a child of France, and an\r\norder was brought to Sully “to pay what was right to the heralds,\r\ntrumpeters, and hautbois players who had performed at the baptism of\r\nAlexander, Monsieur, child of France.”  After looking at the order, Sully\r\ndetained it, and had another made out, which made no mention of\r\nAlexander.  The men complained, saying, “Sir, the sum we ought to have\r\nfor our attendance at the baptism of children of France has for a long\r\nwhile been fixed.”  “ Away, away!” said Sully, in a rage; “I’ll do\r\nnothing of the sort; there are no children of France.”  And he told the\r\nking about it, who said, “There’s malice in that, but I will certainly\r\nstop it; tear up that order.”  And turning to some of his courtiers, “See\r\nthe tricks that people play, and the traps they lay for those who serve\r\nme well and after my own heart.  An order hath been sent to M. de Rosny,\r\nwith the design of offending me if he honored it, or of offending the\r\nDuchess of Beaufort if he repudiated it.  I will see to it.  Go to her,\r\nmy friend,” he said to Rosny; “tell her what has taken place; satisfy her\r\nin so far as you can.  If that is not sufficient, I will speak like the\r\nmaster, and not like the man.”  Sully went to the cloister of St.\r\nGermain, where the Duchess of Beaufort was lodged, and told her that he\r\ncame by the king’s command to inform her of what was going on.  “I am\r\naware of all,” said Gabrielle, “and do not care to know any more; I am\r\nnot made as the king is, whom you persuade that black is white.”  “Ho!\r\nho! madame,” replied Sully, “since you take it in that way, I kiss your\r\nhands, and shall not fail to do my duty for all your furies.”  He\r\nreturned to the Louvre and told the king.  “Here, come with me,” said\r\nHenry; “I will let you see that women have not possession of me, as\r\ncertain malignant spirits spread about that they have.”  He got into\r\nSully’s carriage, went with him to the Duchess of Beaufort’s, and, taking\r\nher by the hand, said, “Now, madame, let us go into your room, and let\r\nnobody else enter except you, and Rosny, and me.  I want to speak to you\r\nboth, and teach you to be good friends together.”  Then, having shut the\r\ndoor quite close, and holding Gabrielle with one hand and Rosny\r\nwith the other, he said, “Good God! madame, what is the meaning of this?\r\nSo you would vex me for sheer wantonness of heart in order to try my\r\npatience?  By God, I swear to you that, if you continue these fashions of\r\ngoing on, you will find yourself very much out in your expectations.  I\r\nsee quite well that you have been put up to all this pleasantry in order\r\nto make me dismiss a servant whom I cannot do without, and who has always\r\nserved me loyally for five and twenty years.  By God, I will do nothing\r\nof the kind, and I declare to you that if I were reduced to such a\r\nnecessity as to choose between losing one or the other, I could better do\r\nwithout ten mistresses like you than one servant like him.”\r\n\r\nGabrielle stormed, was disconsolate, wept, threw herself at the king’s\r\nfeet, and, “seeing him more strong-minded than had been supposed by those\r\nwho had counselled her to this escapade, began to calm herself,” says\r\nSully, “and everything was set right again on every side.”\r\n\r\nBut Sully was not at the end of his embarrassments or of the sometimes\r\nfeeble and sometimes sturdy fancies of his king.  On the 10th of April,\r\n1599, Gabrielle d’Estrees died so suddenly that, according to the bias of\r\nthe times, when, in the highest ranks, crimes were so common that they\r\nwere always considered possible and almost probable, she was at first\r\nsupposed to have been poisoned; but there seemed to be no likelihood of\r\nthis.  The consent of Marguerite de Valois to the annulment of her\r\nmarriage was obtained; and negotiations were opened at Rome by Arnold\r\nd’Ossat, who was made a cardinal, and by Brulart de Sillery, ambassador\r\nad hoc.  But a new difficulty supervened; not for the negotiators, who\r\nknew, or appeared to know, nothing about it, but for Sully.  In three or\r\nfour weeks after the death of Gabrielle d’Estrees Henry IV. was paying\r\ncourt to a new favorite.  One morning, at Fontainebleau, just as he was\r\ngoing out hunting, he took Sully by the hand, led him into the first\r\ngallery, gave him a paper, and, turning the other way as if he were\r\nashamed to see it read by Sully, “Read that,” said he, “and then tell me\r\nyour opinion of it.”  Sully found that it was a promise of marriage given\r\nto Mdlle. Henriette d’Entraigues, daughter of Francis de Balzac, Lord of\r\nEntraigues, and Marie Touchet, favorite of Charles IX.  Sully went up to\r\nthe king, holding in his hand the paper folded up.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of it?” said the king.  “Now, now, speak freely; your\r\nsilence offends me far more than your most adverse expressions could.  I\r\nmisdoubt me much that you will not give me your approval, if it were only\r\nfor the hundred thousand crowns that I made you hand over with so much\r\nregret; I promise you not to be vexed at anything you can possibly say to\r\nme.”  “You mean it, sir, and you promise not to be angry with me,\r\nwhatever I may say or do?”  “Yes, yes; I promise all you desire, since\r\nfor anything you say it will be all the same, neither more nor less.”\r\n Thereupon, taking that written promise as if he would have given it back\r\nto the king, Sully, instead of that, tore it in two, saying, a “There,\r\nsir, as you wish to know, is what I think about such a promise.”  “Ha!\r\nmorbleu, what are you at?  Are you mad?”  “It is true, sir; I am a madman\r\nand fool; and I wish I were so much thereof as to be the only one in\r\nFrance.”  “Very well, very well: I understand you,” said the king, “and\r\nwill say no more, in order to keep my word to you; but give me back that\r\npaper.”  “Sir,” replied Sully, “I have no doubt your Majesty is aware\r\nthat you are destroying all the preparatives for your dismarriage, for,\r\nthis promise once divulged,--and it is demanded of you for no other\r\npurpose,--never will the queen, your wife, do the things necessary to\r\nmake your dismarriage valid, nor indeed will the pope bestow upon it his\r\nApostolic blessing; that I know of my own knowledge.”\r\n\r\nThe king made no answer, went out of the gallery, entered his closet,\r\nasked for pen and ink, remained there a quarter of an hour, wrote out a\r\nsecond paper like that which had just been torn up, mounted his horse\r\nwithout saying a word to Sully whom he met, went hunting, and, during the\r\nday, deposited the new promise of marriage with Henriette d’Entraigues,\r\nwho kept it or had it kept in perfect secrecy till the 2d of July, the\r\ntime at which her father, the Count of Entiaigues, gave her up to, the\r\nking in consideration of twenty thousand crowns cash.\r\n\r\nIn the teeth of all these incidents, known or voluntarily ignored, the\r\nnegotiations for the annulment of the marriage of Henry IV.  and\r\nMarguerite de Valois were proceeded with at Rome by consent of the two\r\nparties.  Clement VIII. had pronounced on the 17th of December, 1599,\r\nand transmitted to Paris by Cardinal de Joyeuse the decree of annulment.\r\nOn the 6th of January, 1600, Henry IV. gave his ambassador, Brulart de\r\nSillery, powers to conclude at Florence his marriage with Mary\r\nde’ Medici, daughter of Francis I. de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany,\r\nand Joan, Archduchess of Austria and niece of the Grand Duke Ferdinand I.\r\nde’ Medici, who had often rendered Henry IV. pecuniary services dearly\r\npaid for.  As early as the year 1592 there had been something said about\r\nthis project of alliance; it was resumed and carried out on the 5th of\r\nOctober, 1600, at Florence with lavish magnificence.  Mary embarked at\r\nLeghorn on the 17th with a fleet of seventeen galleys; that of which she\r\nwas aboard, the _General,_ was all covered over with jewels, inside and\r\nout; she arrived at Marseilles on the 3d of November, and at Lyons on the\r\n2d of December, where she waited till the 9th for the king, who was\r\ndetained by the war with Savoy.  He entered her chamber in the middle of\r\nthe night, booted and armed, and next day, in the cathedral-church of\r\nSt. John, re-celebrated his marriage, more rich in wealth than it was\r\ndestined to be in happiness.  Mary de’ Medici was beautiful in 1592, when\r\nshe had first been talked about, and her portrait at that time had\r\ncharmed the king; but in 1600 she was twenty-seven, tall, fat, with\r\nround, staring eyes and a forbidding air, and ill dressed.  She knew\r\nhardly a word of French; and Henriette d’Entraigues, whom the king had\r\nmade Marquise do Verneuil, could not help exclaiming when she saw her,\r\n“So that is the fat bankeress from Florence!”\r\n\r\nHenry IV. seemed to have attained in his public and in his domestic life\r\nthe pinnacle of earthly fortune and ambition.  He was, at one and the\r\nsame time, Catholic king and the head of the Protestant polity in Europe,\r\naccepted by the Catholics as the best, the only possible, king for them\r\nin France.  He was at peace with all Europe, except one petty prince, the\r\nDuke of Savoy, Charles Emmanuel I., from whom he demanded back the\r\nmarquisate of Saluzzo, or a territorial compensation in France itself on\r\nthe French side of the Alps.  After a short campaign, and thanks to\r\nRosny’s ordnance, he obtained what he desired, and by a treaty of January\r\n17, 1601, he added to French territory La Bresse, Le Bugey, the district\r\nof Gex, and the citadel of Bourg, which still held out after the capture\r\nof the town.  He was more and more dear to France, to which he had\r\nrestored peace at home as well as abroad, and industrial, commercial,\r\nfinancial, monumental, and scientific prosperity, until lately unknown.\r\nSully covered the country with roads, bridges, canals, buildings, and\r\nworks of public utility.  The moment the king, after the annulment of his\r\nmarriage with Marguerite de Valois, saw his new wife, Mary de’ Medici, at\r\nLyons, she had disgusted him, and she disgusted him more every day by her\r\ncantankerous and headstrong temper; but on the 27th of September, 1601,\r\nshe brought him a son, who was to be Louis XIII.  Henry used to go for\r\ndistraction from his wife’s temper to his favorite, Henriette\r\nd’Entraigues, who knew how to please him at the same time that she was\r\nhaughty and exacting towards him.  He set less store upon the peace of\r\nhis household than upon that of his kingdom; he had established his\r\nfavorite at the Louvre itself, close beside his wife; and, his new\r\nmarriage once contracted, he considered his domestic life settled, as\r\nwell as his political position.\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken on both points; he was not at the end of either his\r\npolitical dangers or his amorous fancies.  Since 1595, his principal\r\ncompanion in arms, or rather his camp-favorite, Charles de Gontaut, Baron\r\nde Biron, whom he had made admiral, duke, and marshal of France, was, all\r\nthe while continuing to serve him in the field, becoming day by day a\r\ndetermined conspirator against him.  He had begun by being a reckless\r\ngamester; and in that way he lost fifteen hundred thousand crowns, about\r\nsix millions (of francs) of our day.  “I don’t know,” said he, “whether I\r\nshall die on the scaffold or not; but I will never come to the\r\npoorhouse.”  He added, “When peace is concluded, the king’s love-affairs,\r\nthe scarcity of his largesses, and the discontent of many will lead to\r\nplenty of splits, more than are necessary to embroil the most peaceful\r\nkingdoms in the world.  And, should that fail, we shall find in religion\r\nmore than we want to put the most lukewarm Huguenots in a passion and the\r\nmost penitent Leaguers in a fury.”  Henry IV. regarded Biron with tender\r\naffection.  I never loved anybody as I loved him,” he used to say;\r\n“I would have trusted my son and my kingdom to him.  He has done me good\r\nservice; but he cannot say that I did not save his life three times.  I\r\npulled him out of the enemy’s hands at Fontaine-Francaise so wounded and\r\nso dazed with blows, that, as I had acted soldier in saving him, I also\r\nacted marshal as regarded the retreat.”  Biron nevertheless prosecuted\r\nhis ambitious designs; the independent sovereignty of Burgundy was what\r\nhe aspired to, and any alliance, any plot, was welcome as a\r\nstepping-stone.  “Caesar or nothing,” he would say.  “I will not die\r\nwithout seeing my head on a quarter-crown piece.”  He entered into\r\nflagrant conspiracy with the King of Spain, with the Duke of Savoy, with\r\nthe French malcontents, the Duke of Bouillon, and the Count of Auvergne.\r\nHenry IV. knew it, and made every effort to appear ignorant of it, to win\r\nBiron back to him; he paid his debts; he sent him on an embassy he\r\ntempted him to confessions which should entitle him to a full pardon.\r\n“Let him weep,” he would say, “and I will weep with him; let him remember\r\nwhat he owes me, and I will not forget what I owe him.  I were loath that\r\nMarshal de Biron should be the first example of my just severity, and\r\nthat my reign, which has hitherto been calm and serene, should be charged\r\nall at once with thunder and lightning.”  He employed Rosily to bring\r\nBiron to confess.  “My friend,” said he, “here is an unhappy man, the\r\nmarshal.  It is a serious case.  I am anxious to spare him.  I cannot\r\nbring myself to harm a man who has courage, who has served me so long and\r\nbeen so familiar with me.  My fear is that, though I spare him, he will\r\nnot spare me or my children, or my kingdom.  He would never confess\r\nanything to me; he behaves to me like a man who has some mischief in his\r\nheart.  I beg you to see him.  If he is open with you, assure him that he\r\nmay come to me and I will forgive him with all my heart.”  Rosny tried\r\nand failed.  “It is not I who want to destroy this man,” said the king;\r\n“it is he who wants to destroy himself.  I will myself tell him that, if\r\nhe lets himself be brought to justice, he has no mercy whatever to expect\r\nfrom me.”  He saw Biron at Fontainebleau, received him after dinner,\r\nspoke to him with his usual familiarity, and pointing to his own\r\nequestrian statue in marble which was on the mantelpiece, said, “What\r\nwould the King cf Spain say if he saw me like that, eh?”  “He would not\r\nbe much afraid of you,” answered Biron.  Henry gave him a stern look.\r\nThe marshal tried to take back his words: “I mean, sir, if he were to see\r\nyou in that statue yonder, and not in your own person.”  The retreat was\r\nnot successful; the shot had taken effect; Henry left the room, went back\r\ninto his closet, and gave orders to his captain of the guard to arrest\r\nhim.  Then he returned to the room and said, “Marshal, reflect upon what\r\nI have said to you.”  Biron preserved a frigid silence.  “Adieu, Baron de\r\nBiron!” said the king, thus by a single word annulling all his dignities,\r\nand sending him before his proper judges to answer for his treasons.  On\r\nthe 18th of June, 1602, he brought the marshal before the court of\r\nParliament.  The inquiry lasted three weeks.  Biron was unanimously\r\ncondemned to death by a hundred and twenty-seven judges “for conspiracies\r\nagainst the king’s person, attempts upon his kingdom, and treasons and\r\ntreaties with the enemies of the kingdom.”  The king gave to this\r\nsentence all the alleviations compatible with public interests.  He\r\nallowed Biron to make his will, remitted the confiscation of his\r\nproperty, and ordered that the execution should take place at the\r\nBastille, in the presence of certain functionaries, and not on the Place\r\nde Greve and before the mob.  When Biron found himself convicted and\r\nsentenced, he burst into a fury, loaded his judges with insults, and\r\nroared out that “if he were driven to despair and frenzy, he would\r\nstrangle half of those present and force the other half to kill him.”\r\n The executioner was obliged to strike him unawares.  Those present\r\nwithdrew dumbfounded at the crime, the prisoner’s rage, the execution,\r\nand the scene.\r\n\r\nWhen the question of conspiracies and conspirators--with Spain against\r\nFrance and her king had thus been publicly raised and decided, it\r\nentailed another: had the Spanish monks, the Jesuits, to call them by\r\ntheir own name, taken part therein?  Should proceedings accordingly be\r\ntaken against them?  They were no longer in France; they had been\r\nbanished on the 29th of December, 1594, by a solemn decree of Parliament,\r\nafter John Chatel’s attempt.  They were demanding their return.  The pope\r\nwas demanding it for them.  If at other times,” they said, “the society\r\nhad shown hostility to France and her king, it was because, though well\r\nreceived everywhere else, especially in the dominions of the King of\r\nSpain, they had met in France with nothing but persecutions and insults.\r\nIf Henry would be pleased to testify good will towards them, he would\r\nsoon find them devoted to his person and his throne.”  The question was\r\ndebated at the king’s council, and especially between Henry IV. and Sully\r\nwhen they were together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry IV. and his Ministers----138]\r\n\r\nSully did not like the return of the Jesuits.  “They are away,” said he;\r\n“let them remain so.  If they return, it will be all very fine for them\r\nto wish, and all very fine for them to act; their presence, their\r\ndiscourse, their influence, involuntary though it be, will be opposed to\r\nyou, will heat your enemies, will irritate your friends; hatred and\r\nmistrust will go on increasing.”  The king was of a different opinion.\r\n“Of necessity,” he said to Sully, “I must now do one of two things: admit\r\nthe Jesuits purely and simply, relieve them from the defamation and\r\ninsults with which they have been blasted, and put to the proof all their\r\nfine sentiments and excellent promises, or use against them all\r\nseverities that can be imagined to keep them from ever coming near me and\r\nmy dominions.  In which latter case, there is no doubt it would be enough\r\nto reduce them to utter despair, and to thoughts of attempting my life;\r\nwhich would render me miserable or listless, living constantly in\r\nsuspicion of being poisoned or assassinated, for these gentry have\r\ncommunications and correspondence everywhere, and great dexterity in\r\ndisposing men’s minds as it seems good to them.  It were better for me to\r\nbe dead, being therein of Caesar’s opinion that the pleasantest death is\r\nthat which is least foreseen and apprehended.”  The king then called to\r\nremembrance the eight projected or attempted assassinations which, since\r\nthe failure of John Chatel, from 1596 to 1603, had been, and clearly\r\nestablished to have been, directed against him.  Upon this, Sully at once\r\nwent over to the king’s opinion.  In September, 1603, letters for the\r\nrestoration of the Jesuits were issued and referred to the Parliament of\r\nParis.  They there met, on the 24th of December, with strong opposition\r\nand remonstrances that have remained celebrated, the mouthpiece being the\r\npremier president Achille de Harlay, the same who had courageously\r\nwithstood the Duke of Guise.  He conjured the king to withdraw his\r\nletters patent, and to leave intact the decree which had banished the\r\nJesuits.  This was not, he said, the feeling of the Parliament of Paris\r\nonly, but also of the Parliaments of Normandy and Burgundy; that is, of\r\ntwo thirds of the magistrates throughout the king dom.  Henry was touched\r\nand staggered.  He thanked the Parliament most affectionately; but, “We\r\nmust not reproach the, Jesuits for the League,” said he; “it was the\r\nfault of the times.  Leave me to deal with this business.  I have managed\r\nothers far more difficult.”  The Parliament obeyed, though with regret,\r\nand on the 2d of January, 1604, the king’s letters patent were\r\nenregistered.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only business that Henry had at heart; he had another of\r\nanother sort, and, for him, more difficult to manage.  In February, 1609,\r\nhe saw, for the first time, at the court of France, Charlotte Marguerite,\r\nthird daughter of the Constable de Montmorency, only sixteen years old.\r\n“There was at that time,” say all contemporaries, “nothing so beautiful\r\nunder heaven, or more graceful, or more perfect.”  Before presenting her\r\nat court, her father had promised her to Francis de Bassompierre,\r\ndescended from a branch of the house of Cloves, thirty years old, and\r\nalready famous for his wit, his magnificence, and his gallantry.  He was\r\none of the principal gentlemen of the chamber to the king.  Henry IV.\r\nsent for him one morning, made him kneel on a hassock in front of his\r\nbed, and said that, obtaining no sleep, he had been thinking of him the\r\nnight before, and of getting him married.  “As for me,” says\r\nBassompierre, “who was thinking of nothing so little as of what he wanted\r\nto say to me, I answered that, if it were not for the constable’s gout,\r\nit would have already been done.  ‘No,’ said he to me, ‘I thought of\r\ngetting you married to Mlle. d’Aumale, and, in consequence of that\r\nmarriage, of renewing the Duchy of Aumale in your person.’  I asked him\r\nif he wanted me to have two wives.  Then he said to me with a deep sigh,\r\n‘Bassompierre, I will speak to thee as a friend.  I have become not only\r\nenamoured, but mad, beside myself, about Mlle. de Montmorency.  If thou\r\nwed her and she love thee, I shall hate thee; if she loved me, thou\r\nwouldst hate me.  It is better that this should not be the cause of\r\ndestroying our good understanding, for I love thee affectionately and\r\nsincerely.  I am resolved to marry her to my nephew the Prince of Conde,\r\nand keep her near my family.  That shall be the consolation and the\r\nsupport of the old age which is coming upon me.  I shall give my nephew,\r\nwho is young and loves hunting ten thousand times better than women, a\r\nhundred thousand francs a year to pass his time, and I want no other\r\nfavor from her but her affection, without looking for anything more.”\r\n\r\nThoroughly astounded and put out as he was, Bassompierre reflected that\r\nit was, so far as he was concerned, “an amour modified by marriage,” and\r\nthat it would be better to give way to the king with a good grace: and,\r\n“I withdraw, sir,” he said, on very good terms as regarded Mdlle. de\r\nMontmorency as well as himself.  The king embraced him, wept, promised to\r\nlove him dearly, saw him again in the evening in company with Mdlle. de\r\nMontmorency, who knew nothing, and conversed a long while with the young\r\nprincess.  When she retired, perceiving that Bassompierre was watching\r\nher, she shrugged her shoulders, as if to hint to him what the king had\r\nsaid to her.  “I lie not,” says Bassompierre: “that single action pierced\r\nme to the heart; I spent two days in tormenting myself like one\r\npossessed, without sleeping, drinking, or eating.”  Two or three days\r\nafterwards the Prince of Conde, announced that he intended to marry\r\nMdlle.  de Montmorency.  The court and the city talked of nothing but\r\nthis romance and the betrothal which immediately followed.\r\n\r\nHenry IV. was fifty-six.  He had been given to gallantry all his life;\r\nand he had never been faithful or exacting in his attachments.  He was\r\nnot one of those on whom ridicule fastens as fair prey; but he was so\r\nunder the dominion of his new passion that the young Princess of Conde,\r\nwho had at first exclaimed, “Jesus, my God, he is mad!”  began to fancy\r\nto herself that she would be queen before long.  Mary de Medici became\r\njealous and uneasy.  She determined to take her precautions, and demanded\r\nto be crowned before the king set out on the campaign which, it was said,\r\nhe was about to commence against Austria in accordance with his grand\r\ndesign and in concert with the Protestant princes of Germany, his allies.\r\nThe Prince of Conde had a fit of jealousy; he carried off his wife first\r\ninto Picardy; and then to Brussels, where he left her.  Henry IV., in\r\nrespect, first, of going to see her, then of getting her to come back,\r\nthen of threatening to go after her out of France, took some wild and\r\npuerile steps, which, being coincident with his warlike announcements and\r\npreparations, caused some strange language to be used, and were injurious\r\nto his personal weight as well as to his government’s character for\r\nsteadiness.  Sully grew impatient and uneasy.  Mary de’ Medici was\r\ninsisting strongly upon being crowned.  The prospect of this coronation\r\nwas displeasing to Henry IV., and he did not conceal it.  “Hey! my\r\nfriend,” he said to Sully: “I know not what is the meaning of it, but my\r\nheart tells me that some misfortune will happen to me.”  He was sitting\r\non a low chair which had been made for him by Sully’s orders at the\r\nArsenal, thinking and beating his fingers on his spectacle-case; then all\r\non a sudden he jumped up, and slapping his hands upon his thighs, “By\r\nGod,” he said, “I shall die in this city, and shall never go out of it.\r\nThey will kill me; I see quite well that they have no other remedy in\r\ntheir dangers but my death.  Ah! accursed coronation!  Thou wilt be the\r\ncause of my death.”  “Jesus! Sir,” cried Sully, “what fancy of yours is\r\nthis?  If it continue, I am of opinion that you should break off this\r\nanointment and coronation, and expedition and war; if you please to give\r\nme orders, it shall soon be done.”  “Yes, break off the coronation,” said\r\nthe king: “let me hear no more about it; I shall have my mind at rest\r\nfrom divers fancies which certain warnings have put into it.  To bide\r\nnothing from you, I have been told that I was to be killed at the first\r\ngrand ceremony I should undertake, and that I should die in a carriage.”\r\n “You never told me that, sir; and so have I often been astounded to see\r\nyou cry out when in a carriage, as if you had dreaded this petty peril,\r\nafter having so many times seen you amidst cannon-balls, musketry,\r\nlance-thrusts, pike-thrusts, and sword-thrusts; without being a bit\r\nafraid.  Since your mind is so exercised thereby, if I were you, I would\r\ngo away to-morrow, let the coronation take place without you, or put it\r\noff to another time, and not enter Paris for a long while, or in a\r\ncarriage.  If you please, I will send word to Notre-Dame and St. Denis\r\nto stop everything and to withdraw the workmen.”  “I am very much\r\ninclined,” said the king; “ but what will my wife say?  For she hath\r\ngotten this coronation marvellously into her head.”  “She may say what\r\nshe likes; but I cannot think that, when she knows your opinion about it,\r\nshe will persist any longer.”\r\n\r\nWhatever Sully might say, Mary de’ Medici “took infinite offence at the\r\nking for his alarms: the matter was disputed for three days, with high\r\nwords on all sides, and at last the laborers were sent back to work\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nHenry, in spite of his presentiments, made no change in his plans; he did\r\nnot go away; he did not defer the queen’s coronation; on the contrary, he\r\nhad it proclaimed on the 12th of May, 1610, that she would be crowned\r\nnext day, the 13th, at St. Denis, and that on Sunday, the 16th, she would\r\nmake her entry into Paris.  On Friday, the 14th, he had an idea of going\r\nto the Arsenal to see Sully, who was ill; we have the account of this\r\nvisit and of the king’s assassination given by Malherbe, at that time\r\nattached to the service of Henry IV., in a letter written on the 19th of\r\nMay, from the reports of eye-witnesses, and it is here reproduced, word\r\nfor word.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Arsenal in the Reign of Henry IV.----143]\r\n\r\n“The king set out soon after dinner to go to the Arsenal.  He deliberated\r\na long while whether he should go out, and several times said to the\r\nqueen, ‘My dear, shall I go or not?’  He even went out two or three\r\ntimes, and then all on a sudden returned, and said to the queen, ‘My\r\ndear, shall I really go?’ and again he had doubts about going or\r\nremaining.  At last he made up his mind to go, and, having kissed the\r\nqueen several times, bade her adieu.  Amongst other things that were\r\nremarked he said to her, ‘I shall only go there and back; I shall be here\r\nagain almost directly.’  When he got to the bottom of the steps, where\r\nhis carriage was waiting for him, M. de Praslin, his captain of the\r\nguard, would have attended him, but said to him, ‘Get you gone; I want\r\nnobody; go about your business.’\r\n\r\n“Thus having about him only a few gentlemen and some footmen, he got into\r\nhis carriage, took his place on the back seat at the left hand side, and\r\nmade M. d’Epernon sit at the right.  Next to him, by the door, were M. de\r\nMontbazon and M. de la Force; and by the door on M. d’Epernon’s side were\r\nMarshal de Lavardin and M. de Crsqui; on the front seat the Marquis of\r\nMirabeau and the first equerry.  When he came to the Croix-du-Tiroir he\r\nwas asked whither it was his pleasure to go; he gave orders to go towards\r\nSt. Innocent.  On arriving at Rue de la Ferronnerie, which is at the end\r\nof that of St. Honors on the way to that of St. Denis, opposite the\r\nSalamandre he met a cart, which obliged the king’s carriage to go nearer\r\nto the ironmongers’ shops which are on the St. Innocent side, and even to\r\nproceed somewhat more slowly, without stopping, however, though somebody,\r\nwho was in a hurry to get the gossip printed, has written to that effect.\r\nHere it was that an abominable assassin, who had posted himself against\r\nthe nearest shop, which is that with the _Coeur couronng perce d’une\r\nfleche,_ darted upon the king, and dealt him, one after the other, two\r\nblows with a knife in the left side; one, catching him between the armpit\r\nand the nipple, went upwards without doing more than graze; the other\r\ncatches him between the fifth and sixth ribs, and, taking a downward\r\ndirection, cuts a large artery of those called venous.  The king, by\r\nmishap, and as if to further tempt this monster, had his left hand on the\r\nshoulder of M. de Montbazon, and with the other was leaning on M.\r\nd’Epernon, to whom he was speaking.  He uttered a low cry and made a few\r\nmovements.  M. de Montbazon having asked, ‘What is the matter, sir?’ he\r\nanswered, ‘It is nothing,’ twice; but the second time so low that there\r\nwas no making sure.  These are the only words he spoke after he was\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n“In a moment the carriage turned towards the Louvre.  When he was at the\r\nsteps where he had got into the carriage, which are those of the queen’s\r\nroom, some wine was given him.  Of course some one had already run\r\nforward to bear the news.  Sieur de Csrisy, lieutenant of M. de Praslin’s\r\ncompany, having raised his head, he made a few movements with his eyes,\r\nthen closed them immediately, without opening them again any more.  He\r\nwas carried up stairs by M. de Montbazon and Count de Curzon en Quercy,\r\nand laid on the bed in his closet, and at two o’clock carried to the bed\r\nin his chamber, where he was all the next day and Sunday.  Somebody went\r\nand gave him holy water.  I tell you nothing about the queen’s tears; all\r\nthat must be imagined.  As for the people of Paris, I think they never\r\nwept so much as on this occasion.”\r\n\r\nThe grief was deep and general, at the court as well as amongst the\r\npeople, in the provinces as well as at Paris; and with the grief were\r\nmingled surprise and alarm, and an idea, also, that the king had died\r\nunhappy and uneasy.  On the 14th of May, in the morning, before starting\r\nupon his visit to the Arsenal, he had gone to hear mass at the\r\nFeuillants’ [order of St.  Bernard]; and on his return he said to the\r\nDuke of Guise and to Bassompierre, who were in attendance, “You do not\r\nunderstand me now, you and the rest; but I shall die one of these days,\r\nand, when you have lost me, you will know my worth and the difference\r\nthere is between me and other kings.”  “My God, sir,” said Bassompierre,\r\n“will you never cease vexing us by telling us that you will soon die?\r\nYou will live, please God, some good, long years.  You are only in the\r\nflower of your age, in perfect bodily health and strength, full of honor\r\nmore than any mortal man, in the most flourishing kingdom in the world,\r\nloved and adored by your subjects, with fine houses, fine women, fine\r\nchildren who are growing up.”  Henry sighed as he said, “My friend, all\r\nthat must be left.”\r\n\r\nThese are the last words that are to be found of his in contemporary\r\naccounts; a few hours afterwards he was smitten to death in his carriage,\r\nbrought back to the Louvre, laid out on his bed; one of his councillors\r\nof state, M. de Vie, seated on the same bed, had put to his mouth his\r\ncross of the order, and directed his thoughts to God; Milon, his chief\r\nphysician, was at the bedside, weeping: his surgeons wanted to dress his\r\nwounds; a sigh died away on his lips, and “It is all over,” said the\r\nphysician; “he is gone.”  Guise and Bassompierre went out to look after\r\nwhat was passing out of doors; they met “M. de Sully with some forty\r\nhorse, who, when he came up to us, said to us in tearful wise,\r\n‘Gentlemen, if the service ye vowed to the king is impressed upon your\r\nsouls as deeply as it ought to be with all good Frenchmen, swear all of\r\nye this moment to keep towards the king his son and successor the same\r\nallegiance that ye showed him, and to spend your lives and your blood in\r\navenging his death?’   ‘Sir,’ said Bassompierre, ‘it is for us to cause\r\nthis oath to be taken by others; we have no need to be exhorted thereto;’\r\nSully turned his eyes upon him, he adds, and then went and shut himself\r\nup in the Bastille, sending out to ‘seize and carry off all the bread\r\nthat could be found in the market and at the bakers’.  He also despatched\r\na message in haste to M. de Rohan, his son-in-law, bidding him face about\r\nwith six thousand Swiss, whose colonel-general he was, and march on\r\nParis.”  Henry IV.  being dead, it was for France and for the kingship\r\nthat Sully felt alarm and was taking his precautions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Louvre----145]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.----REGENCY OF MARY DE’ MEDICI. (1610-1617.)\r\n\r\nOn the death of Henry IV. there was extreme disquietude as well as grief\r\nin France.  To judge by appearances, however, there was nothing to\r\njustify excessive alarm.  The edict of Nantes (April 13, 1598) had put an\r\nend, so far as the French were concerned, to religious wars.  The treaty\r\nof Vervins (May 2, 1598) between France and Spain, the twelve years’\r\ntruce between Spain and the United Provinces (April 9, 1609), the death\r\nof Philip II. (September 13, 1598), and the alliance between France and\r\nEngland seemed to have brought peace to Europe.  It might have been\r\nthought that there remained no more than secondary questions, such as the\r\npossession of the marquisate of Saluzzo and the succession to the duchies\r\nof C1eves and Juliers.  But the instinct of peoples sees further than the\r\nnegotiations of diplomats.  In the public estimation of Europe Henry IV.\r\nwas the representative of and the security for order, peace, national and\r\nequitable policy, intelligent and practical ideas.  So thought Sully\r\nwhen, at the king’s death, he went, equally alarmed and disconsolate, and\r\nshut himself up in the arsenal; and the people had grounds for being of\r\nSully’s opinion.  Public confidence was concentrated upon the king’s\r\npersonality.  Spectators pardoned, almost with a smile, those tender\r\nfoibles of his which, nevertheless, his proximity to old age rendered\r\nstill more shocking.  They were pleased at the clear-sighted and strict\r\nattention he paid to the education of his son Louis, the dauphin, to\r\nwhose governess, Madame de Montglas, he wrote, “I am vexed with you for\r\nnot having sent me word that you have whipped my son, for I do wish and\r\ncommand you to whip him every time he shows obstinacy in anything wrong,\r\nknowing well by my own case that there is nothing in the world that does\r\nmore good than that.”  And to Mary de’ Medici herself he added, “Of one\r\nthing I do assure you, and that is, that, being of the temper I know you\r\nto be of, and foreseeing that of your son, you stubborn, not to say\r\nheadstrong, madame, and he obstinate, you will verily have many a tussle\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marie de Medicis----147]\r\n\r\nHenry IV. saw as clearly into his wife’s as into his son’s character.\r\nPersons who were best acquainted with the disposition of Mary de’ Medici,\r\nand were her most indulgent critics, said of her, in 1610, when she was\r\nnow thirty-seven years of age, “that she was courageous, haughty, firm,\r\ndiscreet, vain, obstinate, vindictive and mistrustful, inclined to\r\nidleness, caring but little about affairs, and fond of royalty for\r\nnothing beyond its pomp and its honors.”  Henry had no liking for her or\r\nconfidence in her, and in private had frequent quarrels with her.  He\r\nhad, nevertheless, had her coronation solemnized, and had provided by\r\nanticipation for the necessities of government.  On the king’s death, and\r\nat the imperious instance of the Duke of Epernon, who at once introduced\r\nthe queen, and said in open session, as he exhibited his sword, “It is as\r\nyet in the scabbard; but it will have to leap therefrom unless this\r\nmoment there be granted to the queen a title which is her due according\r\nto the order of nature and of justice,” the Parliament forthwith declared\r\nMary regent of, the kingdom.  Thanks to Sully’s firm administration,\r\nthere were, after the ordinary annual expenses were paid, at that time in\r\nthe vaults of the Bastille or in securities easily realizable, forty-one\r\nmillion three hundred and forty-five thousand livres, and there was\r\nnothing to suggest that extraordinary and urgent expenses would come to\r\ncurtail this substantial reserve.  The army was disbanded, and reduced to\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen thousand men, French or Swiss.  For a long time\r\npast no power in France had, at its accession, possessed so much material\r\nstrength and so much moral authority.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Concini, Leonora Galigai, and Mary de’ Medici----149]\r\n\r\nBut Mary de’ Medici had, in her household and in her court, the\r\nwherewithal to rapidly dissipate this double treasure.  In 1600, at the\r\ntime of her marriage, she had brought from Florence to Paris her nurse’s\r\ndaughter, Leonora Galigai, and Leonora’s husband, Concino Concini, son_\r\nof a Florentine notary, both of them full of coarse ambition, covetous,\r\nvain, and determined to make the best of their new position so as to\r\nenrich themselves, and exalt themselves beyond measure, and at any price.\r\nMary gave them, in that respect, all the facilities they could possibly\r\ndesire; they were her confidants, her favorites, and her instruments, as\r\nregarded both her own affairs and theirs.  These private and subordinate\r\nservants were before long joined by great lords, court-folks, ambitious\r\nand vain likewise, egotists, mischief-makers, whom the strong and able\r\nhand of Henry IV. had kept aloof, but who, at his death, returned upon\r\nthe scene, thinking of nothing whatever but their own fortunes and their\r\nrivalries.  They shall just be named here pell-mell, whether members or\r\nrelatives of the royal family or merely great lords the Condes, the\r\nContis, the Enghiens, the Dukes of Epernon, Guise, Elbeuf, Mayenne,\r\nBouillon, and Nevers, great names and petty characters encountered at\r\nevery step under the regency of Mary de’ Medici, and, with their\r\nfollowing, forming about her a court-hive, equally restless and useless.\r\nTime does justice to some few men, and executes justice on the ruck: one\r\nmust have been of great worth indeed to deserve not to be forgotten.\r\nSully appeared once more at court after his momentary retreat to the\r\narsenal; but, in spite of the show of favor which Mary de’ Medici thought\r\nit prudent and decent to preserve towards him for some little time, he\r\nsoon saw that it was no longer the place for him, and that he was of as\r\nlittle use there to the state as to himself; he sent in, one after the\r\nother, his resignation of all his important offices, and terminated his\r\nlife in regular retirement at Rosny and Sully-sur-Loire.  Du Plessis-\r\nMornay attempted to still exercise a salutary influence over his party.\r\n\r\n“Let there be no more talk amongst us,” said he, “of Huguenots or\r\nPapists; those words are prohibited by our edicts.  And, though there\r\nwere no edict at all, still if we are French, if we love our country, our\r\nfamilies, and even ourselves, they ought henceforth to be wiped out of\r\nour remembrance.  Whoso is a good Frenchman, shall to me be a citizen,\r\nshall to me be a brother.”  This meritorious and patriotic language was\r\nnot entirely without moral effect, but it no longer guided, no longer\r\ninspired the government; egotism, intrigue, and mediocrity in ideas as\r\nwell as in feelings had taken the place of Henry IV.  Facts, before long,\r\nmade evident the sad result of this.  All the parties, all the personages\r\nwho walked the stage and considered themselves of some account, believed\r\nthat the moment had arrived for pushing their pretensions, and lost no\r\ntime about putting them forward.  Those persons we will just pass in\r\nreview without stopping at any one of them.  History has no room for all\r\nthose who throng about her gates without succeeding in getting in and\r\nleaving traces of their stay. The reformers were the party to which the\r\nreign of Henry IV. had brought most conquests, and which was bound to\r\nstrive above everything to secure the possession of them by extracting\r\nfrom them every legitimate and practicable consequence.  Mary de’ Medici,\r\nhaving been declared regent, lost no time about confirming, on the 22d of\r\nMay, 1610, the edict of Nantes and proclaiming religious peace as the due\r\nof France.  “We have nothing to do with the quarrels of the grandees,”\r\n said the people of Paris; “we have no mind to be mixed up with them.”\r\n Some of the preachers of repute and of the party’s old leaders used the\r\nsame language.  “There must be nought but a scarf any longer between us,”\r\n Du Plessis-Mornay would say.  Two great Protestant names were still\r\nintact at this epoch: one, the Duke of Sully, without engaging in\r\nreligious polemics, had persisted in abiding by the faith of his fathers,\r\nin spite of his king’s example and attempts to bring him over to the\r\nCatholic faith: the other, Du Plessis-Mornay, had always striven, and was\r\ncontinuing to strive, actively for the Protestant cause.  These two\r\nillustrious champions of the Reformed party were in agreement with the\r\nnew principles of national right, and with the intelligent instincts of\r\ntheir people, whose confidence they deserved and seemed to possess.\r\n\r\nBut the passions, the usages, and the suspicions of the party were not\r\nslow in reappearing.  The Protestants were highly displeased to see the\r\nCatholic worship and practices re-established in Bearn, whence Queen\r\nJeanne of Navarre had banished them; the rights of religious liberty were\r\nnot yet powerful enough with them to surmount their taste for exclusive\r\ndomination.  As a guarantee for their safety, they had been put in\r\npossession of several strong places in France; neither the edict of\r\nNantes nor its confirmation by Mary de’ Medici appeared to them a\r\nsufficient substitute for this guarantee; and they claimed its\r\ncontinuance, which was granted them for five years.  After Henry IV.’s\r\nconversion to Catholicism, his European policy had no longer been\r\nessentially Protestant; he had thrown out feelers and entered into\r\nnegotiations for Catholic alliances; and these, when the king’s own\r\nliberal and patriotic spirit was no longer there to see that they did not\r\nsway his government, became objects of great suspicion and antipathy to\r\nthe Protestants.  Henry had constantly and to good purpose striven\r\nagainst the spirit of religious faction and civil war; anxious, after his\r\ndeath, about their liberty and their political importance, the Reformers\r\nreassumed a blind confidence in their own strength, and a hope of forming\r\na small special state in the midst of the great national state.  Their\r\nprovincial assemblies and their national synods were, from 1611 to 1621,\r\neffective promoters of this tendency, which before long became a formal\r\nand organized design; at Saumur, at Tonneins, at Privas, at Grenoble, at\r\nLoudun, at La Rochelle, the language, the movements, and the acts of the\r\nparty took more and more the character of armed resistance, and, ere\r\nlong, of civil war; the leaders, old and new.\r\n\r\nDuke Henry of Rohan as well as the Duke of Bouillon, the Marquis of La\r\nForce as well as the Duke of Lesdiguieres, more or less timidly urged on\r\nthe zealous Protestants in that path from which the ancient counsels of\r\nSully and Mornay were not successful in deterring them.  On the 10th of\r\nMay, 1621, in the assembly at La Rochelle, a commission of nine members\r\nwas charged to present and get adopted a, plan of military organization\r\nwhereby Protestant France, Warn included, was divided into eight circles,\r\nhaving each a special council composed of three deputies at the general\r\nassembly, under a chief who had the disposal of all the military forces;\r\nwith each army-corps there was a minister to preach; the royal moneys,\r\ntalliages, aid and gabel, were to be seized for the wants of the army;\r\nthe property of the Catholic church was confiscated, and the revenues\r\ntherefrom appropriated to the expenses of war and the pay of the\r\nministers of the religion.  It was a Protestant republic, organized on\r\nthe model of the United Provinces, and disposed to act as regarded the\r\nFrench kingship with a large measure of independence.  When, after thus\r\npreparing for war, they came to actually make it, the Protestants soon\r\ndiscovered their impotence; the Duke of Bouillon, sixty-five years of age\r\nand crippled with gout, interceded for them in his letters to Louis\r\nXIII., but did not go out of Sedan; the Duke of Lesdiguieres, to whom the\r\nassembly had given the command of the Protestants of Burgundy, Provence,\r\nand Dauphiny, was at that very moment on the point of abjuring their\r\nfaith and marching with their enemies.  Duke Henry of Rohan himself, who\r\nwas the youngest, and seemed to be the most ardent, of their new chiefs,\r\nwas for doing nothing and breaking up.  “If you are not disposed to\r\nsupport the assembly,” said the Marquis of Chateauneuf, who had been sent\r\nto him to bring him to a decision, “it will be quite able to defend\r\nitself without you.”  “If the assembly,” said Rohan, feeling his honor\r\ntouched, “does take resolutions contrary to my advice, I shall not sever\r\nmyself from the interest of our churches; “and he sacrificed his better\r\njudgment to the popular blindness.  The Dukes of La Tremoille and of\r\nSoubise, and the Marquises of La Force and of Chatillon followed suit.\r\nAs M. de Sismondi says, to these five lords and to a small number of\r\ntowns was the strength reduced of the party which was defying the King of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThus, since the death of Henry IV., the king and court of France were\r\nmuch changed: the great questions and the great personages had\r\ndisappeared.  The last of the real chiefs of the League, the brother of\r\nDuke Henry of Guise, the old Duke of Mayenne, he on whom Henry, in the\r\nhour of victory, would wreak no heavier vengeance than to walk him to a\r\nstand-still, was dead.  Henry IV.’s first wife, the sprightly and too\r\nfacile Marguerite de Valois, was dead also, after consenting to descend\r\nfrom the throne in order to make way for the mediocre Mary de’ Medici.\r\nThe Catholic champion whom Henry IV. felicitated himself upon being able\r\nto oppose to Du Plessis-Mornay in the polemical conferences between the\r\ntwo communions, Cardinal de Perron, was at the point of death.  The decay\r\nwas general, and the same amongst the Protestants as amongst the\r\nCatholics; Sully and Mornay held themselves aloof or were barely listened\r\nto.  In place of these eminent personages had come intriguing or\r\nambitious subordinates, who were either innocent of or indifferent to\r\nanything like a great policy, and who had no idea beyond themselves and\r\ntheir fortunes.  The husband of Leonora Galigai, Concini, had amassed a\r\ngreat deal of money and purchased the Marquisate of Ancre; nay, more, he\r\nhad been created Marshal of France, and he said to the Count of\r\nBassompiere, “I have learned to know the world, and I am aware that a\r\nman, when he has arrived at a certain pitch of prosperity, comes down\r\nwith a greater run the higher he has mounted.  When I came to France,\r\nI was not worth a son, and I owed more than eight thousand crowns.\r\nMy marriage and the queen’s kind favor has given me much advancement,\r\noffice, and honor; I have worked at making my fortune, and I pushed it\r\nforward as long as I saw the wind favorable.  So soon as I felt it\r\nturning, I thought about beating a retreat and enjoying in peace the\r\nlarge property we have acquired.  It is my wife who is opposed to this\r\ndesire.  At every crack of the whip we receive from Fortune, I continue\r\nto urge her.  God knows whether warnings have been wanting.  My\r\ndaughter’s death is the last, and, if we do not heed it, our downfall is\r\nat hand.”  Then he quietly made out an abstract of all his property,\r\namounting to eight millions, with which he purposed to buy from the pope\r\nthe usufruct of the duchy of Ferrara, and leave his son, besides, a fine\r\ninheritance.  But his wife continued her opposition; it would be cowardly\r\nand ungrateful, she said, to abandon the queen: “So that,” cried he, “I\r\nsee myself ruined without any help for it; and, if it were not that I am\r\nunder so much obligation to my wife, I would leave her and go some\r\nwhither where neither grandees nor common folk would come to look after\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThis modest style of language did not prevent Marshal d’Ancre from\r\noccasionally having strange fits of domineering arrogance.  “By God,\r\nsir,” he wrote to one of his friends, “I have to complain of you; you\r\ntreat for peace without me; you have caused the queen to write to me\r\nthat, for her sake, I must give up the suit I had commenced against M. de\r\nMontbazon to get paid what he owes me.  In all the devils’ names, what do\r\nthe queen and you take me for?  I am devoured to my very bones with\r\nrage.”  In his dread lest influence opposed to his own should be\r\nexercised over the young king, he took upon himself to regulate his\r\namusements and his walks, and prohibited him from leaving Paris.  Louis\r\nXIII. had amongst his personal attendants a young nobleman, Albert de\r\nLuynes, clever in training little sporting birds, called butcher-birds\r\n(pies grieches, or shrikes), then all the rage; and the king made him his\r\nfalconer and lived on familiar terms with him.  Playing at billiards one\r\nday, Marshal d’Ancre, putting on his hat, said to the king, “I hope your\r\nMajesty will allow me to be covered.”  The king allowed it, but remained\r\nsurprised and shocked.  His young page, Albert de Luynes, observed his\r\ndispleasure, and being anxious, himself also, to become a favorite, he\r\ntook pains to fan it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis XIII. and Albert de Luynes----154]\r\n\r\nA domestic plot was set hatching against Marshal d’Ancre.  What was its\r\nextent and who were the accomplices in it?  This is not clear.  However\r\nit may have been, on the 24th of April, 1617, M. de Vitry, captain of the\r\nguard (_capitaine de quartier_) that day in the royal army which was\r\nbesieging Soissons, ordered some of his officers to provide themselves\r\nwith a pistol each in their pockets, and he himself went to that door of\r\nthe Louvre by which the king would have to go to the queenmother’s.  When\r\nMarshal d’Ancre arrived at this door, “There is the marshal,” said one of\r\nthe officers; and Vitry laid hands upon him, saying, “Marshal, I have the\r\nking’s orders to arrest you.”  “Me!” said the marshal in surprise, and\r\nattempting to resist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Murder of Marshal d’Ancre----155]\r\n\r\nThe officer fired upon him, and so did several others.  It was never\r\nknown, or, at any rate, never told, whose shot it was that hit him; but,\r\n“Sir,” said Colonel d’Ornano, going up to the young king, “you are this\r\nminute King of France: Marshal d’Ancre is dead.”  And the young king,\r\nbefore the assembled court, repeated with the same tone of satisfaction,\r\n“Marshal d’Ancre is dead.”  Baron de Vitry was appointed Marshal of\r\nFrance in the room of the favorite whom he had just murdered.  The day\r\nafter the murder, the mob rushed into the church of St. German-\r\nl’Auxerrois, where the body of Marshal d’Ancre had been interred; they\r\nheaved up the slabs, hauled the body from the ground, dragged it over the\r\npavement as far as the Pont-Neuf, where they hanged it by the feet to a\r\ngallows; and they afterwards tore it in pieces, which were sold, burned,\r\nand thrown into the Seine.  The ferocious passions of the populace were\r\nsatisfied; but court-hatred and court-envy were not; they attacked the\r\nmarshal’s widow, Leonora Galigai.  She resided at the Louvre, and, at the\r\nfirst rumor of what had happened, she had sent to demand asylum with the\r\nqueen-mother.  Meeting with a harsh refusal, she had undressed herself in\r\norder to protect with her body her jewels which she had concealed in her\r\nmattresses.  The moment she was discovered, she was taken to the Bastille\r\nand brought before the Parliament.  She began by throwing all the blame\r\nupon her husband; it was he, she said, who had prevented her from\r\nretiring into Italy, and who had made every attempt to push his fortunes\r\nfarther.  When she was sentenced to death, Leonora recovered her courage\r\nand pride.  “Never,” said a contemporary, “was anybody seen of more\r\nconstant and resolute visage.”  “What a lot of people to look at one poor\r\ncreature!” said she at sight of the crowd that thronged upon her passage.\r\nThere is nothing to show that her firmness at the last earned her more of\r\nsympathy than her weaknesses had brought her of compassion.  The mob has\r\nits seasons of pitilessness.  Leonora Galigai died leaving one child, a\r\nson, who was so maltreated that he persisted in refusing all food, and,\r\nat last, would take nothing but the sweetmeats that the young queen, Anne\r\nof Austria, married two years before to Louis XIII., had the kindness to\r\nsend him.\r\n\r\nWe encounter in this very insignificant circumstance a trace of one of\r\nthose important events which marked the earliest years of Mary de’\r\nMedici’s regency and the influence of her earliest favorites.  Concini\r\nand his wife, both of them, probably, in the secret service of the court\r\nof Madrid, had promoted the marriage of Louis XIII. with the Infanta Anne\r\nof Austria, eldest daughter of Philip III., King of Spain, and that of\r\nPhilip, Infante of Spain, who was afterwards Philip IV., with Princess\r\nElizabeth of France, sister of Louis XIII.  Henry IV., in his plan for\r\nthe pacification of Europe, had himself conceived this idea, and\r\ntestified a desire for this double marriage, but without taking any\r\ntrouble to bring it about.  It was after his death that, on the 30th of\r\nApril, 1612, Villeroi, minister of foreign affairs in France, and Don\r\nInigo de Caderiias, ambassador of the King of Spain, concluded this\r\ndouble union by a formal deed.  They signed on the same day, at\r\nFontainebleau, between the King and Queen-regent of France on one side\r\nand the King, of Spain on the other, a treaty of defensive alliance to\r\nthe effect “that those sovereigns should give one another mutual succor\r\nagainst such as should attempt anything against their kingdoms or revolt\r\nagainst their authority; that they should, in such case, send one to the\r\nother, at their own expense for six months, a body of six thousand foot\r\nand twelve hundred horse; that they should not assist any criminal\r\ncharged with high treason, and should even give them over into the hands\r\nof the ambassadors of the king who claimed them.”  It is quite certain\r\nthat Henry IV. would never have let his hands be thus tied by a treaty so\r\ncontrary to his general policy of alliance with Protestant powers, such\r\nas England and the United Provinces; he had no notion of servile\r\nsubjection to his own policy, but he would have taken good care not to\r\nabandon it; he was of those, who, under delicate circumstances, remain\r\nfaithful to their ideas and promises without systematic obstinacy and\r\nwith a due regard for the varying interests and requirements of their\r\ncountry and their age.  The two Spanish marriages were regarded in France\r\nas an abandonment of the national policy; France was, in a great\r\nmajority, Catholic, but its Catholicism differed essentially from the\r\nSpanish Catholicism: it affirmed the entire separation of the temporal\r\npower and the spiritual power, and the inviolability of the former by the\r\nlatter; it refused assent, moreover, to certain articles of the council\r\nof Trent.  It was Gallican Catholicism, determined to keep a pretty large\r\nmeasure of national independence, political and moral, as opposed to\r\nSpanish Catholicism, essentially devoted to the cause of the papacy and\r\nof absolutist Austria.  Under the influence of this public feeling, the\r\ntwo Spanish marriages and the treaty which accompanied them were\r\nunfavorably regarded by a great part of France: a remedy was desired;\r\nit was hoped that one would be found in the convocation of the\r\nstates-general of the kingdom, to which the populace always looked\r\nexpectantly; they were convoked first for the 16th of September, 1614,\r\nat Sens; and, afterwards, for the 20th of October following, when the\r\nyoung king, Louis XIII., after the announcement of his majority, himself\r\nopened them in state.  Amongst the members there were one hundred and\r\nforty of the clergy, one hundred and thirty-two of the noblesse, and one\r\nhundred and ninety-two of the third estate.  The clergy elected for\r\ntheir president Cardinal de Joyeuse who had crowned Mary de’ Medici; the\r\nnoblesse Henry de Bauffremont, Baron of Senecey, and the third estate\r\nRobert Miron, provost of the tradesmen of Paris.\r\n\r\nThese elections were not worth much, and have left no trace on history.\r\nThe chief political fact connected with the convocation of the,\r\nstates-general of 1614, was the entry into their ranks of the youthful\r\nBishop of Lucon, Armand John dot Plessis de Richelieu, marked out by the\r\nfinger of God to sustain, after the powerful reign of Henry IV. and the\r\nincapable regency of Mary de’ Medici, the weight of the government of\r\nFrance.  He was in, two cases elected to the states-general, by the\r\nclergy of Loudun and by that of Poitou.  As he was born on the 5th of\r\nSeptember, 1585, he was but twenty-eight years old in 1614.  He had not\r\nbeen destined for the church, and he was pursuing a layman’s course of\r\nstudy at the college of Navarre, under the name of the Marquis de\r\nChillon, when his elder brother, Alphonse Louis du Plessis de Richelieu,\r\nbecame disgusted yith ecclesiastical life, turned Carthusian, and\r\nresigned the unpretending bishopric of Lucon in favor of his brother\r\nArmand, whom Henry IV. nominated to it in 1605, instructing Cardinal du\r\nPerron, at that time his charge d’affaires at Rome, to recommend to Pope\r\nPaul V. that election which he had very much at heart.  The young\r\nprelate betook himself with so much ardor to his theological studies,\r\nthat at twenty years of age he was a doctor, and maintained his theses\r\nin rochet and camail as bishop-nominate.  At Rome some objection was\r\nstill made to his extreme youth; but he hastened thither, and delivered\r\nbefore the pope a Latin harangue, which scattered all objections to the\r\nwind.  After consecration at Rome, in 1607, he returned to Paris, and\r\nhastened to take possession of his see of Lucon, “the poorest and the\r\nnastiest in France,” as he himself said. He could support poverty, but\r\nhe also set great store by riches, and he was seriously anxious for the\r\nexpenses of his installation.  “Taking after you, that is, being a\r\nlittle vain,” he wrote to one of his fair friends, Madame de Bourges,\r\nwith whom he was on terms of familiar correspondence about his affairs,\r\n“I should very much like, being more easy in my circumstances, to make\r\nmore show: but what can I do?  No house; no carriage; furnished\r\napartments are inconvenient; I must borrow a coach, horses, and a\r\ncoachman, in order to at least arrive at Lucon with a decent turn-out.”\r\n He purchased second-hand the velvet bed of one Madame de Marconnay, his\r\naunt; he made for himself a muff out of a portion of his uncle the\r\nCommander’s martenskins.  Silver-plate he was very much concerned about.\r\n“I beg you,” he wrote to Madame de Bourges, “to send me word what will\r\nbe the cost of two dozen silver dishes of fair size, as they are made\r\nnow; I should very much like to get them for five hundred crowns, for my\r\nresources are not great.  I am quite sure that for a matter of a hundred\r\ncrowns more, you would not like me to have anything common.  I am a\r\nbeggar, as you know; in such sort that I cannot do much in the way of\r\nplaying the opulent; but at any rate, when I have silver dishes, my\r\nnobility will be considerably enhanced.”\r\n\r\nHe succeeded, no doubt, in getting his silver dishes and his\r\nwell-appointed episcopal mansion; for when, in 1614, he was elected to\r\nthe states-general, he had acquired amongst the clergy and at the court\r\nof Louis XIII. sufficient importance to be charged with the duty of\r\nspeaking, in presence of the king, on the acceptance of the acts of the\r\ncouncil of Trent, and on the restitution of certain property belonging\r\nto the Catholic church in Warn.  He made skilful use of the occasion for\r\nthe purpose of still further exalting and improving the question and his\r\nown position.  He complained that for a long time past ecclesiastics had\r\nbeen too rarely summoned to the sovereign’s councils, “as if the honor\r\nof serving God,” he said, “rendered them incapable of serving the king;”\r\n he took care at the same time to make himself pleasant to the mighty\r\nones of the hour; he praised the young king for having, on announcing\r\nhis majority, asked his mother to continue to watch over France, and “to\r\nadd to the august title of mother of the king that of mother of the\r\nkingdom.” The post of almoner to the queen-regnant, Anne of Austria, was\r\nhis reward.  He carried still further his ambitious foresight; in\r\nFebruary, 1615, at the time when the session of the states-general\r\nclosed, Marshal d’Ancre and Leonora Galigai were still favorites with\r\nthe queen-mother; Richelieu laid himself out to be pleasant to them, and\r\nreceived from the marshal in 1616 the post of secretary of state for war\r\nand foreign affairs.  Marshal d’Ancre was at that time looking out for\r\nsupports against his imminent downfall.  When, in 1617, he fell and was\r\nmassacred, people were astonished to find Richelieu on good terms with\r\nthe marshal’s court-rival Albert de Luynes, who pressed him to remain in\r\nthe council at which he had sat for only five months.  To what extent\r\nwas the Bishop of Lucon at that time on terms of understanding with the\r\nvictor?  There is no saying; but to accept the responsibility of the new\r\nfavorite’s accession was a compromising act.  Richelieu judged it more\r\nprudent to remain Bishop of Lucon and to wear the appearance of defeat\r\nby following Mary de’ Medici to Blois, whither, since the fall of her\r\nfavorites, she had asked leave to retire.  He would there, he said, be\r\nmore useful to the government of the young king; for, remaining at the\r\nside of Mary de’ Medici, he would be able to advise her and restrain\r\nher.  He so completely persuaded Louis XIII.  and Albert de Luynes, that\r\nhe received orders to set out for Blois with the queen-mother, which he\r\ndid on the 4th of May, 1617.  The Bishop of Lucon, though still young,\r\nwas already one of the ambitious sort who stake their dignity upon the\r\nultimate success of their fortunes, success gained no matter at what\r\nprice, by address or by hardihood, by complaisance or by opposition,\r\naccording to the requirements of facts and times.  Dignity apart, the\r\nyoung bishop had accurately measured the expediency of the step he was\r\ntaking in the interest of his future, high-soaring ambition.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Blois with the queen-mother, he began by dividing his life\r\nbetween that petty court in disgrace and his diocese of Lucon.  He wished\r\nto set Albert de Luynes at rest as to his presence at the court of Mary\r\nde’ Medici, the devotion he showed her, and the counsels he gave her.  He\r\nhad but small success, however.  The new favorite was suspicious and\r\nanxious.  Richelieu appeared to be occupied with nothing but the duties\r\nof his office; he presided at conferences; and he published, against the\r\nProtestants, a treatise entitled _The Complete Christian (De la\r\nPerfection du Chretien)_.  Luynes was not disposed to believe in these\r\nexclusively religious preoccupations; he urged upon the king that\r\nRichelieu should not live constantly in the queen-mother’s neighborhood,\r\nand in June, 1617, he had orders given him to retire to the courtship of\r\nAvignon.  Pope Paul V. complained that the Bishop of Lucon was exiled\r\nfrom his diocese.  “What is to be done about residence,” said he, “which\r\nis due to his bishopric?  and what will the world say at seeing him\r\nprohibited from going whither his duty binds him to go?”  The king\r\nanswered that he was surprised at the pope’s complaint.  “An\r\necclesiastic,” said he, “could not possibly be in any better place than\r\nAvignon, church territory; my lord the Bishop of Lucon is far from\r\nfinding time for nothing but the exercises of his profession; I have\r\ndiscovered that he indulged in practices prejudicial to my service.  He\r\nis one of those spirits that are carried away far beyond their duty, and\r\nare very dangerous in times of public disorder.”\r\n\r\nRichelieu obeyed without making any objection; he passed two years at\r\nAvignon, protesting that he would never depart from it without the\r\nconsent of Luynes and without the hope of serving him.  The favor and\r\nfortune of the young falconer went on increasing every day.  He had, in\r\n1617, married the daughter of the Duke of Montbazon, and, in 1619,\r\nprevailed upon the king to have the estate of Maille raised for him to a\r\nduchy-peerage under the title of Luynes.  In 1621 he procured for himself\r\nthe dignity of constable, to which he had no military claim.  Louis XIII.\r\nsometimes took a malicious pleasure in making fun of his favorite’s\r\ncupidity and that of his following.  “I never saw,” said he, “one person\r\nwith so many relatives; they come to court by ship-loads, and not a\r\nsingle one of them with a silk dress.”  “See,” said he one day to the\r\nCount of Bassompierre, pointing to Luynes surrounded by a numerous\r\nfollowing: “he wants to play the king, but I shall know how to prevent\r\nit; I will make him disgorge what he has taken from me.”  Friends at\r\ncourt warned Luynes of this language; and Luynes replied with a somewhat\r\ndisdainful impertinence, “It is good for me to cause the king a little\r\nvexation from time to time: it revives the affection he feels for me.”\r\n Richelieu kept himself well informed of court-rumors, and was cautious\r\nnot to treat them with indifference.  He took great pains to make himself\r\npleasant to the young constable.  “My lord,” he wrote to him in August,\r\n1621, “I am extremely pleased to have an opportunity of testifying to\r\nyou, that I shall never have any possession that I shall not be most\r\nhappy to employ for the satisfaction of the king and yourself.  The queen\r\ndid me the honor of desiring that I should have the abbey of Redon; but\r\nthe moment I knew that the king and you, my lord, were desirous of\r\ndisposing of it otherwise, I gave it up with very good cheer, in order\r\nthat being in your hands you might gratify therewith whomsoever you\r\npleased; assuring you, my lord, that I have more contentment in\r\ntestifying to you thereby that which you will on every occasion recognize\r\nin me, than I should have had by an augmentation of four thousand crowns’\r\nincome.  The queen is very well, thank God.  I think it will be very meet\r\nthat from time to time, by means of those who are passing, you should\r\nsend her news of the king and of you and yours, which will give her great\r\nsatisfaction “ (Letters of Cardinal Richelieu, t. i.  p. 690).\r\n\r\nWhilst Richelieu was thus behaving towards the favorite with complaisance\r\nand modesty, Mary de’ Medici, whose mouthpiece he appeared to be, assumed\r\na different posture, and used different language; she complained bitterly\r\nof the slavery and want of money to which she was reduced at Blois; a\r\nplot, on the part of both aristocrats and domestics, were contrived by\r\nthose about her to extricate her; she entered into secret relations with\r\na great, a turbulent, and a malcontent lord, the Duke of Epernon; two\r\nFlorentine servants, Ruccellai and Vincenti Ludovici, were their\r\ngo-betweens; and it was agreed that she should escape from Blois and take\r\nrefuge at Angouleme, a lordship belonging to the Duke of Epernon.  She at\r\nthe same time wrote to the king to plead for more liberty.  He replied,\r\n“Madame, having understood that you have a wish to visit certain places\r\nof devotion, I am rejoiced thereat.  I shall be still more pleased if you\r\ntake a resolution to move about and travel henceforward more than you\r\nhave done in the past; I consider that it will be of great service to\r\nyour health, which is extremely precious to me.  If business permitted me\r\nto be of the party, I would accompany you with all my heart.”  Mary\r\nreplied to him with formal assurances of fidelity and obedience; she\r\npromised before God and His angels “to have no correspondence which could\r\nbe prejudicial to the king’s service, to warn him of all intrigues, which\r\nshould come to her knowledge, that were opposed to his will, and to\r\nentertain no design of returning to court save when it should please the\r\nking to give her orders to do so.”  There was between the king, the\r\nqueen-mother, Albert de Luynes, the Duke of Epernon and their agents, an\r\nexchange of letters and empty promises which deceived scarcely anybody,\r\nand which destroyed all confidence as well as all truthfulness between\r\nthem.  The Duke of Epernon protested that he had no idea of disobeying\r\nthe king’s commands, but that he thought his presence was more necessary\r\nfor the king’s service in Angoumois than at Metz.  He complained at the\r\nsame time that for two years past he had received from the court only the\r\nsimple pay of a colonel at ten months for the year, which took it out of\r\nhis power to live suitably to his rank.  He set out for Metz at the end\r\nof January, 1619, saying, ii I am going to take the boldest step I ever\r\ntook in my life.”\r\n\r\nThe queen-mother made her exit from Blois on the night between the 21st\r\nand 22d of February, 1619, by her closet window, against which a ladder\r\nhad been placed for the desecnt to the terrace, whence a second ladder\r\nwas to enable her to descend right down.  On arriving at the terrace she\r\nfound herself so fatigued and so agitated, that she declared it would be\r\nimpossible to avail herself of the second ladder; she preferred to have\r\nherself let down upon a cloak to the bottom of the terrace, which had a\r\nslight slant.  Her two equerries escorted her along the faubourg to the\r\nend of the bridge.  Some officers of her household saw her pass without\r\nrecognizing her, and laughed at meeting a woman between two men, at night\r\nand with a somewhat agitated air.  “They take me for a bona roba,” said\r\nthe queen.  On arriving at the end of the faubourg of Blois, she did not\r\nfind her carriage, which was to hwe been waiting for her there.  When she\r\nhad come up with it, there was a casket missing which contained her\r\njewels; there was a hundred thousand crowns’ worth in it; the casket had\r\nfallen out two hundred paces from the spot; it was recovered, and the\r\nqueen-mother got into her carriage and took the road to Loches, where the\r\nDuke of Epernon had been waiting for her since the day before.  He came\r\nto meet her with a hundred and fifty horsemen.  Nobody in the household\r\nof Mary de’Medici had observed her departure.\r\n\r\nGreat was the rumors when her escape became known, and greater still when\r\nit was learned in whose hands she had placed herself.  It was civil war,\r\nsaid everybody.  At the commencement of the seventeenth century, there\r\nwere still two possible and even probable chances of civil war in France;\r\none between Catholics and Protestants, and the other between what\r\nremained of the great feudal or quasi-feudal lords and the kingship.\r\nWhich of the two wars was about to commence?  Nobody knew; on one side\r\nthere was hesitation; the most contradictory moves were made.  Louis\r\nXIII., when he heard of his mother’s escape, tried first of all to\r\ndisconnect her from the Duke of Epernon.  “I could never have imagined,”\r\n said be, “that there was any man who, in time of perfect peace, would\r\nhave had the audacity, I do not say to carry out, but to conceive the\r\nresolution of making an attempt upon the mother of his king .  .  . ; in\r\norder to release you from the difficulty you are in, Madame, I have\r\ndetermined to take up arms to put you in possession of the liberty of\r\nwhich your enemies have deprived you.”  And he marched troops and cannon\r\nto Angoumois.  “Many men,” says Duke Henry of Rohan, “envied the Duke of\r\nEpernon his gallant deed, but few were willing to submit themselves to\r\nhis haughty temper, and everybody, having reason to believe that it would\r\nall end in a peace, was careful not to embark in the affair merely to\r\nincur the king’s hatred, and leave to others the honors of the\r\nenterprise.”  The king’s troops were well received wherever they showed\r\nthemselves; the towns opened their gates to them.  “It needs,” said a\r\ncontemporary, “mighty strong citadels to make the towns of France obey\r\ntheir governors when they see the latter disobedient to the king’s.\r\nwill.”  Several great lords held themselves carefully aloof; others\r\ndetermined to attempt an arrangement between the king and his mother; it\r\nwas known what influence over her continued to be preserved by the Bishop\r\nof Lucon, still in exile at Avignon; he was pressed to return; his\r\nconfidant, Father Joseph du Tremblay, was of opinion that he should; and\r\nRichelieu, accordingly, set out.  The governor of Lyons had him arrested\r\nat Vienne in Dauphiny, and was much surprised to find him armed with a\r\nletter from the king, commanding that he should be allowed to pass freely\r\neverywhere.  Richelieu was prepared to advise a reconciliation between\r\nking and queen-mother, and the king was as much disposed to exert himself\r\nto that end as the queen-mother’s friends.  At Limoges the Bishop of\r\nLucon was obliged to carefully avoid Count Schomberg, commandant of the\r\nroyal troops, who was not at all in the secret of the negotiation.  When\r\nhe arrived at Angers a fresh difficulty supervened.  The most daring, of\r\nthe queen-mother’s domestic advisers, Ruccellai, had conceived a hatred\r\nof the bishop, and tried to exclude him from the privy council.\r\nRichelieu let be, “Certain,” as he said, “that they would soon fall back\r\nupon him.”  He was one of the patient as well as ambitious, who can\r\ncalculate upon success, even afar off, and wait for it.  The Duke of\r\nEpernon supported him; Ruccellai, defeated, left the queen-mother, taking\r\nwith him some of her most warmly attached servants.  When the\r\nsubordinates were gone, recourse was had, accordingly, to Richelieu.  On\r\nthe 10th of August, 1619, he concluded at Angouleme between the king and\r\nhis mother a treaty, whereby the king promised to consign to oblivion all\r\nthat had passed since Blois; the queen-mother consented to exchange her\r\ngovernment of Touraine against that of Anjou; and the Duke of Epernon\r\nreceived from the town of Boulogne fifty thousand crowns in recompense\r\nfor what he had done, and he wrote to the king to protest his fidelity.\r\nThe queen-mother still hesitated to see her son; but, at his entreaty,\r\nshe at last sent off the Bishop of Lucon from Angouleme to make\r\npreparations for the interview, and, five days afterwards, she set out\r\nherself, accompanied by the Duke of Epernon, who halted at the limits of\r\nhis own government, not caring to come to any closer quarters with so\r\nrecently reconciled a court.  The king received his mother, according to\r\nsome, in the little town of Cousieres, and, according to others, at Tours\r\nor Amboise.  They embraced, with tears.  “God bless me, my boy, how you\r\nare grown!” said the queen.  “In order to be of more service to you,\r\nmother,” answered the king.  The cheers of the people hailed their\r\nreconciliation; not without certain signs of disquietude on the part of\r\nthe favorite, Albert de Luynes, who was an eye-witness.  After the\r\ninterview, the king set out for Paris again; and Mary de’ Medici returned\r\nto her government of Anjou to take possession of it, promising, she said,\r\nto rejoin her son subsequently at Paris.  Du Plessis-Mornay wrote to one\r\nof his friends at court, “If you do not get the queen along with you, you\r\nhave done nothing at all; distrust will increase with absence; the\r\nmalcontents will multiply; and the honest servants of the king will have\r\nno little difficulty in managing to live between them.”\r\n\r\nHow to live between mother and son without being committed to one or the\r\nother, was indeed the question.  A difficult task.  For three months the\r\ncourtiers were equal to it; from May to July, 1619, the court and the\r\ngovernment were split in two; the king at Paris or at Tours, the\r\nqueen-mother at Angers or at Blois.  Two eminent men, Richelieu amongst\r\nthe Catholics and Du Plessis-Mornay amongst the Protestants, advised\r\nthem strongly and incessantly to unite again, to live and to govern\r\ntogether. “Apply yourself to winning the king’s good graces,” said\r\nRichelieu to the queen-mother: “support on every occasion the interests\r\nof the public without speaking of your own; take the side of equity\r\nagainst that of favor, without attacking the favorites and without\r\nappearing to envy their influence.”  Mornay used the same language to\r\nthe Protestants.  “Do not wear out the king’s patience,” he said to\r\nthem: “there is no patience without limits.”  Louis XIII. listened to\r\nthem without allowing himself to be persuaded by them; the warlike\r\nspirit was striving within the young man; he was brave, and loved war as\r\nwar rather than for political reasons.  The grand provost of Normandy\r\nwas advising him one day not to venture in person into his province,\r\nsaying, “You will find there nothing but revolt and disagreeables.”\r\n “Though the roads were all paved with arms,” answered the king, “I would\r\nmarch over the bellies of my foes, for they have no cause to declare\r\nagainst me, who have offended nobody.  You shall have the pleasure of\r\nseeing it; you served the late king my father too well not to rejoice at\r\nit.”  The queenmother, on her side, was delighted to see herself\r\nsurrounded at Angers by a brilliant court; and the Dukes of Longueville,\r\nof La Tremoille, of Retz, of Rohan, of Mayenne, of Epernon, and of\r\nNemours, promised her numerous troops and effectual support.  She might,\r\nnevertheless, have found many reasons to doubt and wait for proofs.  The\r\nking moved upon Normandy; and his quartermasters came to assign quarters\r\nat Rouen.  “Where have you left the king?” asked the Duke of\r\nLongueville.  “At Pontoise, my lord; but he is by this time far\r\nadvanced, and is to sleep to-night at Magny.”  “Where do you mean to\r\nquarter him here?”  asked the duke.  “In the house where you are, my\r\nlord.”  “It is right that I yield him place,” said the duke, and the\r\nvery same evening took the road back to the district of Caux.  It was\r\nunder this aspect of public feeling that an embassy from the king and a\r\npacific mission from Rome came, without any success, to Rangers, and\r\nthat on the 4th of July, 1619, a fresh civil war between the king and\r\nthe partisans of the queen-mother was declared.\r\n\r\nIt was short and not very bloody, though pretty vigorously contested.\r\nThe two armies met at Ponts de Ce; they had not, either of them, any\r\norders or any desire to fight; and pacific negotiations were opened at La\r\nFleche.  The queen-mother declared that she had made up her mind to live\r\nhenceforth at her son’s court, and that all she desired was to leave\r\nhonorably the party with which she was engaged.  That was precisely the\r\ndifficulty.  The king also declared himself resolved to receive his\r\nmother affectionately; but he required her to abandon the lords of her\r\nparty, and that was what she could not make up her mind to do.  In the\r\nunpremeditated conflict that took place at Ponts de Ce, the troops of the\r\nqueen-mother were beaten.  “They had two hundred men killed or drowned,”\r\n says Bassompierre, “and about as many taken prisoners.”  This reverse\r\nsilenced the queen’s scruples; there was clearly no imperative cause for\r\nwar between her and the king, and the queen’s partisans could not be\r\nblind to the fact that, if the struggle were prolonged, they would be\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nThe kingship had the upper hand in the country, and a consent was given\r\nto the desired arrangements.  “Assure the king that I will go and see him\r\nto-morrow at Brissac,” said the queen-mother.  “I am perfectly satisfied\r\nwith him, and all I think of is to please him, and pray God for him\r\npersonally, and for the prosperity of his kingdom.”  A treaty was\r\nconcluded at Angers on the 10th of August, 1620; the queen-mother\r\nreturned to Paris; and the civil war at court was evidently, not put an\r\nend to never to recur, but stricken with feebleness and postponed.\r\n\r\nTwo men of mark, Albert de Luynes and Richelieu, came out of this crisis\r\nwell content.  The favorite felicitated himself on the king’s victory\r\nover the queen-mother, for he might consider the triumph as his own; he\r\nhad advised and supported the king’s steady resistance to his mother’s\r\nenterprises.  Besides, he had gained by it the rank and power of\r\nconstable; it was at this period that he obtained them, thanks to the\r\nretirement of Lesdiguieres, who gave them up to assume the title of\r\nmarshal-general of the king’s camps and armies.  The royal favor did not\r\nstop there for Luynes; the keeper of the seals, Du Vair, died in 1621;\r\nand the king handed over the seals to the new constable, who thus united\r\nthe military authority with that of justice, without being either a great\r\nwarrior or a great lawyer.  All he had to do was to wait for an\r\nopportunity of displaying his double power.  The defaults of the French\r\nProtestants soon supplied one.  In July, 1567, Henry IV.’s mother, Jeanne\r\nd’Albret, on becoming Queen of Navarre, had, at the demand of the Estates\r\nof Bearn, proclaimed Calvinism as the sole religion of her petty kingdom;\r\nall Catholic worship was expressly forbidden there; religious liberty,\r\nwhich Protestants everywhere invoked, was proscribed in Bearn; moreover,\r\necclesiastical property was confiscated there.  The Catholics complained,\r\nloudly; the Kings of France were supporters of their plaint; it had been\r\nfor a long time past repudiated or eluded; but on the 13th of August,\r\n1620, Louis XIII. issued two edicts for the purpose of restoring in Bearn\r\nfree Catholic worship, and making restitution of their property to the\r\necclesiastical establishments.  The council of Pau, which had at first\r\nrepudiated them, hastened to enregister these edicts in the hope of\r\nretarding at least their execution; but the king said, “In two days I\r\nshall be at Pau; you want me there to assist your weakness.”  He was\r\nasked how he would be received at Pau.  “As sovereign of Warn,” said he.\r\n“I will dismount first of all at the church, if there be one; but, if\r\nnot, I want no canopy or ceremonial entry; it would not become me to\r\nreceive honors in a place where I have never been, before giving thanks\r\nto God, from whom I hold all my dominions and all my power.”  Religious\r\nliberty was thus reestablished at Pau.  “It is the king’s intention,”\r\n said the Duke of Montmorency to the Protestants of Villeneuve-de-Berg,\r\nwho asked that they might enjoy the liberty promised them by the edicts,\r\n“that all his subjects, Catholic or Protestant, be equally free in the\r\nexercise of their religion; you shall not be hindered in yours, and I\r\nwill take good care that you do not hinder the Catholics in theirs.”  The\r\nDuke of Montmorency did not foresee that the son and successor of the\r\nking in whose name he was so energetically proclaiming religious liberty,\r\nLouis XIV., would abolish the edict of Nantes whereby his grandfather,\r\nHenry IV., had founded it.  Justice and iniquity are often all but\r\ncontemporary.\r\n\r\nIt has just been said that not only Luynes, but Richelieu too, had come\r\nwell content out of the crisis brought about by the struggle between\r\nLouis XIII. and the queen-mother.  Richelieu’s satisfaction was neither\r\nso keen nor so speedy as the favorite’s.  Pope Paul V. had announced, for\r\nthe 11th of January, 1621, a promotion of ten cardinals.  At the news of\r\nthis, the queen-mother sent an express courier to Rome with an urgent\r\ndemand that the Bishop of Lucon should be included in the promotion.  The\r\nMarquis of Coeuvres, ambassador of France at Rome, insisted rather\r\nstrongly, in the name of the queen-mother and of the Duke of Luynes, from\r\nwhom he showed the pope some very pressing letters.  The pope, in\r\nsurprise, gave him a letter to read in the handwriting of King Louis\r\nXIII., saying that he did not at all wish the Bishop of Lucon to become\r\ncardinal, and begging that no notice might be taken of any\r\nrecommendations which should be forwarded on the subject.  The\r\nambassador, greatly surprised in his turn, ceased to insist.  It was\r\nevidently the doing of the Duke of Luynes, who, jealous of the Bishop of\r\nLucon and dreading his influence, had demanded and obtained from the king\r\nthis secret measure.  It was effectual; and, at the beginning of the year\r\n1621, Richelieu had but a vague hope of the hat.  He had no idea, when he\r\nheard of this check, that at the end of a few months Luynes would undergo\r\none graver still, would die almost instantaneously after having practised\r\na policy analogous to that which Richelieu was himself projecting, and\r\nwould leave the road open for him to obtain the cardinal’s hat, and once\r\nmore enter into the councils of the king, who, however, said to the\r\nqueen-mother, “I know him better than you, madame; he is a man of\r\nunbounded ambition.”\r\n\r\nThe two victories won in 1620 by the Duke of Luynes, one over the\r\nProtestants by the re-establishment in Warn of free worship for the\r\nCatholics, and the other over his secret rival Richelieu, by preventing\r\nhim from becoming cardinal, had inspired him with great confidence in his\r\ngood fortune.  He resolved to push it with more boldness than he had yet\r\nshown.  He purposed to subdue the Protestants as a political party whilst\r\nrespecting their religious creed, and to reduce them to a condition of\r\nsubjection in the state whilst leaving them free, as Christians, in the\r\nchurch.  A fundamentally contradictory problem; for the different\r\nliberties are closely connected, one with another, and have need to be\r\nsecurity one for another; but, at the commencement of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, people were not so particular in point of consequence, and it\r\nwas thought possible to give religious liberty its guarantees whilst\r\nrefusing them to general political liberty.  That is what the Duke of\r\nLuynes attempted to do; to all the towns to which Henry IV. had bound\r\nhimself by the edict of Nantes, he made a promise of preserving to them\r\ntheir religious liberties, and he called upon them at the same time to\r\nremain submissive and faithful subjects of the sovereign kingship.  La\r\nRochelle, Montauban, Saumur, Sancerre, Charite-sur-Loire, and St. Jean\r\nd’Angely were in this category; and it was to Montauban, as one of the\r\nmost important of those towns, that Louis XIII. first addressed his\r\npromise and his appeal, inconsistent one with the other.\r\n\r\nSome years previously, in May, 1610, amidst the grief and anxiety\r\nawakened by the assassination of Henry IV. by Ravaillac, the population\r\nof Montauban had maintained and testified a pacific and moderate\r\ndisposition.  The synod was in assembly when the news of the king’s death\r\narrived there.  We read in the report of the town-council, under date of\r\nMay 19, 1610,\r\n\r\n“The ecclesiastics (Catholic) having come to the council, the consuls\r\ngave them every assurance for their persons and property, and took them\r\nunder the protection and safeguard of the king and the town, without\r\nsuffering or permitting any hurt, wrong, or displeasure to be done them.\r\n.  .  .  The ecclesiastics thanked them, and protested their desire to\r\nlive and die in that town, as good townsmen and servants of the king . .”\r\n On the 22d of May, in a larger council-general, the council gives notice\r\nto the Parliament of Toulouse that everything shall remain peaceable.\r\n.  .  .  Consul Beraud moves that “every one take forthwith the oath of\r\nfidelity we owe to his Majesty, and that every one also testify, by\r\nacclamation, his wishes and desires for the prosperity and duration of\r\nhis reign.”\r\n\r\nTen years later, in 1620, the disposition of the Protestants was very\r\nmuch changed; distrust and irritation had once more entered into their\r\nhearts.  Henry IV. was no longer there to appease them or hold them in.\r\nThe restoration of the freedom of Catholic worship in Warn had alarmed\r\nand offended them as a violation of their own exclusive right proclaimed\r\nby Jeanne d’Albret.  In January, 1621, during an assembly held at La\r\nRochelle, they exclaimed violently against what they called “the woes\r\nexperienced by their brethren of Warn.”  Louis XIII. considered their\r\nremonstrances too arrogant to be tolerated.  On the 24th of April, 1621,\r\nby a formal declaration, he confirmed all the edicts issued in favor of\r\nthe liberty of Protestants, but with a further announcement that he would\r\nput down with all the rigor of the laws those who did not remain\r\nsubmissive and tranquil in the enjoyment of their own rights.  This\r\nmeasure produced amongst the Protestants a violent schism.  Some\r\nsubmitted, and their chiefs gave up to the king the places they\r\ncommanded.  On the 10th of May, 1621, Saumur opened her gates to him.\r\nOthers, more hot-tempered and more obstinate, persisted in their\r\nremonstrances.  La Rochelle, Montauban, and St. Jean d’Angely took that\r\nside.  Duke Henry of Rohan and the Duke of Soubise, his brother,\r\nsupported them in their resistance.  Rohan went to Montauban, and,\r\nmounting into the pulpit, said to the assembly, “I will not conceal from\r\nyou that the most certain conjecture which can be formed from the current\r\nnews is, that in a short time the royal army will camp around your walls,\r\nsince St. Jean d’Angely is surrendered, and all that remains up to here\r\nis weakened, broken down, and ready to receive the yoke, through the\r\nfactions of certain evil spirits.  I have no fear lest the consternation\r\nand cowardice of the rest should reach by contagion to you.  In days past\r\nyou swore in my presence the union of the churches.  Of a surety we will\r\nget peace restored to you here.  I pray you to have confidence in me,\r\nthat on this occasion I will not desert you, whatever happen.  Though\r\nthere should be but two men left of my religion, I will be one of the\r\ntwo.  My houses and my revenues are seized, because I would not bow\r\nbeneath the proclamation.  I have my sword and my life left.  Three stout\r\nhearts are better than thirty that quail.”\r\n\r\nThe whole assembly vehemently cheered this fiery speech.  The premier\r\nconsul of Montauban, Dupuy, swore to live and die in the cause of union\r\nof the churches.  “The Duke of Rohan exerted himself to place Montauban\r\nin a position to oppose a vigorous resistance to the royal troops.\r\nConsul Dupuy, for his part, was at the same time collecting munitions and\r\nvictuals.”  It was announced that the king’s army was advancing; and\r\nreports were spread, with the usual exaggeration, of the deeds of\r\nviolence it was already committing.  “At the news thereof, every nerve is\r\nstrained to advance the fortifications “there is none that shirks, of\r\nwhatever age, or sex, or condition; every other occupation ceases; night\r\nserves to render the day’s work bigger; the inhabitants are all a-sweat,\r\nsoiled with dust, laden with earth.”  Whilst the multitude was thus\r\nworking pell-mell to put the town substantially in a state of defence,\r\nthe warlike population, gentlemen and burgesses, were arming and\r\norganizing for the struggle.  They had chosen for their chief a younger\r\nson of Sully’s, Baron d’Orval, devoted to the Protestant cause, even to\r\nthe extent of rebellion, whilst his elder brother, the Marquis of Rosny,\r\nwas serving in the royal army.  Their aged father, Sully, went to\r\nMontauban to counsel peace; not that he exactly blamed the resistance,\r\nbut he said that it would be vain, and that a peace on good terms was\r\npossible.  He was listened to with respect, though he was not believed,\r\nand though the struggle was all the while persisted in.  The royal army,\r\nwith a strength of twenty thousand men, and commanded by the young Duke\r\nof Mayenne, son of the great Leaguer, came up on the 18th of August,\r\n1621, to besiege Montauban, with its population of from fifteen thousand\r\nto twenty thousand.  Besiegers and besieged were all of them brave; the\r\nformer the more obstinate, the latter the more hare-brained and rash.\r\nThe siege lasted two months and a half with alternate successes and\r\nreverses.  The people of the town were directed and supported by\r\ncommissions charged with the duty of collecting meal, preparing quarters\r\nfor the troops, looking after the sick and wounded, and distributing\r\nammunition.  “Day and night, from hour to hour, one of the consuls went\r\nto inspect these services.  All was done without confusion, without a\r\nmurmur.  Ministers of the Reformed church, to the number of thirteen,\r\nwere charged to keep up the enthusiasm with chants, psalms, and prayers.\r\nOne of them, the pastor Chamier, was animated by a zealous and bellicose\r\nfanaticism; he was never tired of calling to mind the calamities\r\nundergone by the towns that had submitted to the royal army; he was\r\nincessantly comparing Montauban to Bethulia, Louis XIII.  to\r\nNabuchodonosor, the Duke of Mayenne to Holofernes, the Montalbanese to\r\nthe people of God, and the Catholics to the Assyrians.  The indecision\r\nand diversity of views in the royal camp formed a singular contrast to\r\nthe firm resolution, enthusiasm, and union which prevailed in the town.\r\nOn the 16th and 17th of August the king passed his army in review;\r\nseveral captains were urgent in dissuading him from prosecuting the\r\nsiege; they proposed to build forts around Montauban, and leave there the\r\nDuke of Mayenne “to harass the inhabitants, make them consume both their\r\ngunpowder and their tooth-powder, and, peradventure, bring them to a\r\ncomposition.”  But the self-respect of the king and of the army was\r\ncompromised; the Duke of Luynes ardently desired to change his name for\r\nthat of Duke of Montauban; there was promise of help from the Prince of\r\nConde and the Duke of Vendome, who were commanding, one in Berry and the\r\nother in Brittany.  These personal interests and sentiments carried the\r\nday; the siege was pushed forward with ardor, although without combined\r\neffort; the Duke of Mayenne was killed there on the 16th of September,\r\n1621; and, amongst the insurgents, the preacher Chamier met, on the 17th\r\nof October, the same fate.  It was in the royal army and the government\r\nthat fatigue and the desire of putting a stop to a struggle so costly and\r\nof such doubtful issue first began to be manifested.  And, at the outset,\r\nin the form of attempts at negotiation.  The Duke of Luynes himself had a\r\nproposal made to the Duke of Rohan, who was in residence at Castres, for\r\nan interview, which Rohan accepted, notwithstanding the mistrust of the\r\npeople of Castres, and of the majority of his friends.  The conference\r\nwas held at a league’s distance from Montauban.  After the proper\r\ncompliments, Luynes drew Rohan aside into an alley alone, and, “I thank\r\nyou,” he said, “for having put trust in me; you shall not find it\r\nmisplaced; your safety is as great here as in Castres.  Having become\r\nconnected with you, I desire your welfare; but you deprived me, whilst my\r\nfavor lasted, of the means of procuring the greatness of your house.  You\r\nhave succored Montauban in the very teeth of your king.  It is a great\r\nfeather in your cap; but you must not make too much of it.  It is time to\r\nact for yourself and your friends.  The king will make no general peace;\r\ntreat for them who acknowledge you.  Represent to them of Montauban that\r\ntheir ruin is but deferred for a few days; that you have no means of\r\nhelping them.  For Castres and other places in your department, ask what\r\nyou will, and you shall obtain it.  For your own self, anything you\r\nplease (carte blanche) is offered you.  .  .  .  If you will believe me,\r\nyou will get out of this miserable business with glory, with the good\r\ngraces of the king, and with what you desire for your own fortunes, which\r\nI am anxious to promote so as to be a support to mine.”\r\n\r\nRohan replied, “I should be my own enemy if I did not desire my king’s\r\ngood graces and your friendship.  I will never refuse from my king\r\nbenefits and honors, or from you the offices of a kind connection.  I do\r\nwell consider the peril in which I stand; but I beg you also to look at\r\nyours.  You are universally hated, because you alone possess what\r\neverybody desires.  Wars against them of the religion have often\r\ncommenced with great disadvantages for them; but the restlessness of the\r\nFrench spirit, the discontent of those not in the government, and the\r\ninfluence of foreigners have often retrieved them.  If you manage to make\r\nthe king grant us peace, it will be to his great honor and advantage,\r\nfor, after having humbled the party, without having received any check,\r\nand without any appearance of division within or assistance from without,\r\nhe will have shown that he is not set against the religion, but only\r\nagainst the disobedience it covers, and he will break the neck of other\r\nparties without having met with anything disagreeable.  But, if you push\r\nthings to extremity, and the torrent of your successes does not\r\ncontinue,--and you are on the eve of seeing it stopped in front of\r\nMontauban,--every one will recover his as yet flurried senses, and will\r\ngive you a difficult business to unravel.  Bethink you that you have\r\ngathered in the harvest of all that promises mingled with threats could\r\nenable you to gain, and that the remnant is fighting for the religion in\r\nwhich it believes.  For my own part, I have made up my mind to the loss\r\nof my property and my posts; if you have retarded the effects thereof on\r\naccount of our connection, I am obliged to you for it; but I am quite\r\nprepared to suffer everything, since my mind is made up, having solemnly\r\npromised it and my conscience so bidding me, to hear of nothing but a\r\ngeneral peace.”\r\n\r\nThe reply was worthy of a great soul devoted to a great cause, a soul\r\nthat would not sacrifice to the hopes of fortune either friends or creed.\r\nIt was a mark of Duke Henry of Rohan’s superior character to take\r\naccount, before everything, of the general interests and the moral\r\nsentiments of his party.  The chief of the royal party, the Duke of\r\nLuynes, was, on the contrary, absorbed in the material and momentary\r\nsuccess of his own personal policy; he refused to treat for a general\r\npeace with the Protestants, and he preferred to submit to a partial and\r\nlocal defeat before Montauban, rather than be hampered with the\r\ndifficulties of national pacification.  At a council held on the 26th of\r\nOctober, 1621, it was decided to publicly raise the siege.  The king and\r\nthe royal army departed in November from the precincts of Montauban,\r\nwhich they purposed to attack afresh on the return of spring: the king\r\nwas in a hurry to go and receive at Toulouse the empty acclamations of\r\nthe mob, and he ordered Luynes to go and take, on the little town of\r\nMonheur, in the neighborhood of Toulouse, a specious revenge for his\r\ncheck before Montauban.  Monheur surrendered on the 11th of December,\r\n1621.  Another little village in the neighborhood, Negrepelisse, which\r\noffered resistance to the royal army, was taken by assault, and its\r\npopulation infamously massacred.  But in the midst of these insignificant\r\nvictories, on the 14th of December, 1621, the royal favorite, the\r\nconstable, interim keeper of the seals, Duke Albert of Luynes, had an\r\nattack of malignant fever, and died in three days at the camp of\r\nLongueville.  “What was marvellously surprising, and gave a good idea of\r\nthe world and its vanity,” says his contemporary, the Marquis of Fontaine\r\nMareuil, “was that this man, so great and so powerful, found himself,\r\nnevertheless, to such a degree abandoned and despised, that for two days,\r\nduring which he was in agony, there was scarcely one of his people who\r\nwould stay in his room, the door being open all the time, and anybody who\r\npleased coming in, as if he had been the most insignificant of men; and\r\nwhen his body was taken to be interred, I suppose, to his duchy of\r\nLuynes, instead of priests to pray for him, I saw some of his valets\r\nplaying piquet on his bier whilst they were having their horses baited.”\r\n\r\nIt was not long before magnificence revisited the favorite’s bier.  “On\r\nthe 11th of January, 1622, his mortal remains having arrived at Tours,\r\nall the religious bodies went out to receive it; the constable was placed\r\nin a chariot drawn by six horses, accompanied by pages, Swiss, and\r\ngentlemen in mourning.  He was finally laid in the cathedral-church,\r\nwhere there took place a service which was attended by Marshal de\r\nLesdiguieres, the greatest lords of the court, the judicature, and the\r\ncorporation.  It is a contemporary sheet, the _Mercure Francais,_ which\r\nhas preserved to us these details as to the posthumous grandeur of Albert\r\nde Luynes, after the brutal indifference to which he had been subjected\r\nat the moment of his death.\r\n\r\nHis brothers after him held a high historical position, which the family\r\nhave maintained, through the course of every revolution, to the present\r\nday; a position which M. Cousin took pleasure in calling to mind, and\r\nwhich the last duke but one of Luynes made it a point of duty to\r\ncommemorate by raising to Louis XIII. a massive silver statue almost as\r\nlarge as life, the work of that able sculptor, M. Rudde, which figured at\r\nthe public exhibition set on foot by Count d’Haussonville, in honor of\r\nthe Alsace-Lorrainers whom the late disasters of France drove off in\r\nexile to Algeria.\r\n\r\nRichelieu, when he had become cardinal, premier minister of Louis XIII.\r\nand of the government of France, passed a just but severe judgment upon\r\nAlbert de Luynes.  “He was a mediocre and timid creature,” he said,\r\n“faithless, ungenerous, too weak to remain steady against the assault of\r\nso great a fortune as that which ruined him incontinently; allowing\r\nhimself to be borne away by it as by a torrent, without any foothold,\r\nunable to set bounds to his ambition, incapable of arresting it, and not\r\nknowing what he was about, like a man on the top of a tower, whose head\r\ngoes round and who has no longer any power of discernment.  He would fain\r\nhave been Prince of Orange, Count of Avignon, Duke of Albret, King of\r\nAustrasia, and would not have refused more if he had seen his way to it.”\r\n [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ p. 169, in the _Petitot Collection,_ Series v.,\r\nt. xxii.]\r\n\r\nThis brilliant and truthful portrait lacks one feature which was the\r\nmerit of the Constable de Luynes: he saw coming, and he anticipated, a\r\nlong way off and to little purpose, but heartily enough, the government\r\nof France by a supreme kingship, whilst paying respect, as long as he\r\nlived, to religious liberty, and showing himself favorable to\r\nintellectual and literary liberty, though he was opposed to political\r\nand national liberty.  That was the government which, after him, was\r\npractised with a high hand and rendered triumphant by Cardinal Richelieu\r\nto the honor, if not the happiness, of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.----LOUIS XIII., CARDINAL RICHELIEU, AND THE COURT.\r\n(1622-1642.)\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of Louis XIV.’s reign is the uncontested empire of the\r\nsovereign over the nation, the authority of the court throughout the\r\ncountry.  All intellectual movement proceeded from the court or radiated\r\nabout it; the whole government, whether for war or peace, was\r\nconcentrated in its hands.  Conde, Turenne, Catinat, Luxembourg, Villars,\r\nVendome belonged, as well as Louvois or Colbert, to the court; from the\r\ncourt went the governors and administrators of provinces; there was no\r\nlonger any greatness existing outside of the court; there were no longer\r\nany petty private courts.  As for the state, the king was it.\r\n\r\nFor ages past, France had enjoyed the rare good fortune of seeing her\r\nthrone successively occupied by Charlemagne and Charles V., by St. Louis\r\nand Louis XI., by Louis XII., Francis I.  and Henry IV., great conquerors\r\nor wise administrators, heroic saints or profound politicians, brilliant\r\nknights or models of patriot-kings.  Such sovereigns had not only\r\ngoverned, but also impressed the imagination of the people; it was to\r\nthem that the weak, oppressed by the great feudal lords, had little by\r\nlittle learned to apply for support and assistance; since the reign of\r\nFrancis I., especially, in the midst of the religious struggles which had\r\ncaused division amongst the noblesse and were threatening to create a\r\nstate within the state, the personal position of the grandees, and that\r\nof their petty private courts, had been constantly diminishing in\r\nimportance; the wise policy, the bold and prudent courage of Henry IV.,\r\nand his patriotic foresight had pacified hatred and stayed civil wars; he\r\nhad caused his people to feel the pleasure and pride of being governed by\r\na man of a superior order.  Cardinal Richelieu, more stern than Henry\r\nIV., set his face steadily against all the influences of the great lords;\r\nhe broke them down one after another; he persistently elevated the royal\r\nauthority; it was the hand of Richelieu which made the court and paved\r\nthe way for the reign of Louis XIV.  The Fronde was but a paltry\r\ninterlude and a sanguinary game between parties.  At Richelieu’s death,\r\npure monarchy was founded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHELIEU----180]\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, 1622, the work was as yet full of difficulty.\r\nThere were numerous rivals for the heritage of royal favor that had\r\nslipped from the dying hands of Luynes.  The Prince of Conde, a man of\r\nability and moderation, “a good managing man (_homme de bon menage_),” as\r\nhe was afterwards called by the cardinal, was the first to get possession\r\nof the mind of the king, at that time away from his mother, who was\r\nresiding at Paris.  “It was not so much from dislike that they opposed\r\nher,” says Richelieu, “as from fear lest, when once established at the\r\nking’s council, she might wish to introduce me there.  They acknowledged\r\nin me some force of judgment; they dreaded my wits, fearing lest, if the\r\nking were to take special cognizance of me, it might come to his\r\ncommitting to me the principal care of his affairs.”  [_Memoires de\r\nRichelieu,_ t. ii.  p. 193.]  On returning to Paris, the king,\r\nnevertheless, could not refuse this gratification to his mother.\r\nHowever, “the prince, who was in the habit of speaking very freely, and\r\ncould not be mum about what he had on his mind, permitted himself to go\r\nso far as to say that she had been received into the council on two\r\nconditions, one, that she should have cognizance of nothing but what they\r\npleased, and the other, that, though only a portion of affairs was\r\ncommunicated to her, she would serve as authority for all in the minds of\r\nthe people.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. ii.  p. 194.] In fact, the\r\nqueen-mother quite perceived that she was only shown the articles in the\r\nwindow, and did not enter the shop; “but, with all the prudence and\r\npatience of an Italian, when she was not carried away by passion, she\r\nknew how to practise dissimulation towards the Prince of Conde and his\r\nallies, Chancellor Sillery and his son Puisieux, secretary of state.  She\r\naccompanied her son on an expedition against the Huguenots of the South,\r\nwhich she had not advised, “foreseeing quite well that, if she were\r\nseparated from the king, she would have no part either in peace or war,\r\nand that, if they got on without her for ten months, they would become\r\naccustomed to getting on without her.”  She had the satisfaction of at\r\nlast seeing the Bishop of Lucon promoted to the cardinalship she had so\r\noften solicited for him in vain; but, at the same time, the king called\r\nto the council Cardinal Rochefoucauld, “not through personal esteem for\r\nthe old cardinal,” says Richelieu, “but to cut off from the new one all\r\nhope of a place for which he might be supposed to feel some ambition.”\r\n Nevertheless, in spite of his enemies’ intrigues, in spite of a certain\r\ninstinctive repugnance on the part of the king himself, who repeated to\r\nhis mother, “I know him better than you, madame; he is a man of unbounded\r\nambition,” the “new cardinal” was called to the council at the opening of\r\nthe year 1624, on the instance of the Marquis of La Vieuville,\r\nsuperintendent of finance and chief of the council, who felt himself\r\nunsteady in his position, and sought to secure the favor of the\r\nqueen-mother.  It was as the protege and organ of Mary de’ Medici that\r\nthe cardinal wrote to the Prince of Conde, on the 11th of May, 1624, “The\r\nking having done me the honor to place me on his council, I pray God with\r\nall my heart to render me worthy of serving him as I desire; and I feel\r\nmyself bound thereto by every sort of consideration.  I cannot\r\nsufficiently thank you for the satisfaction that you have been pleased to\r\ntestify to me thereat.  Therefore would I far rather do so in deed by\r\nserving you than by bootless words.  And in that I cannot fail without\r\nfailing to follow out the king’s intention.  I have made known to the\r\nqueen the assurance you give her by your letter of your affection, for\r\nwhich she feels all the reciprocity you can desire.  She is the more\r\nready to flatter herself with the hope of its continuance, in that she\r\nwill be very glad to incite you thereto by all the good offices she has\r\nmeans of rendering you with His Majesty.”  [_Lettres du Cardinal de\r\nRichelieu,_ t. ii.  p. 5.] On the 12th of August, however, M. de la\r\nVieuville fell irretrievably, and was confined in the castle of Amboise.\r\nA pamphlet of the time had forewarned him of the danger which threatened\r\nhim when he introduced Richelieu into the council.  “You are both of the\r\nsame temper,” it said; “that is, you both desire one and the same thing,\r\nwhich is, to be, each of you, sole governor.  That which you believe to\r\nbe your making will be your undoing.”\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the cardinal, in spite of his modest resistance based\r\nupon the state of his health, became the veritable chief of the council.\r\n“Everybody knew that, amidst the mere private occupations he had hitherto\r\nhad, it would have been impossible for him to exist with such poor\r\nhealth, unless he took frequent recreation in the country.”  [_Memoires\r\nde Richelieu,_ t. ii.  p. 289.] Turning his attention to founding his\r\npower and making himself friends, he authorized the recall of Count\r\nSchomberg, lately disgraced, and of the Duke of Anjou’s, the king’s\r\nbrother’s, governor, Colonel Ornano, imprisoned by the Marquis of La\r\nVieuville.  He, at the same time, stood out against the danger of\r\nconcentrating all the power of the government in a single pair of hands.\r\n“Your Majesty,” he said, “ought not to confide your public business to a\r\nsingle one of your councillors and hide it from the rest; those whom you\r\nhave chosen ought to live in fellowship and amity in your service, not in\r\npartisanship and division.  Every time, and as many times as a single one\r\nwants to do everything himself, he wants to ruin himself; but in ruining\r\nhimself he will ruin your kingdom and you, and as often as any single one\r\nwants to possess your ear and do in secret what should be resolved upon\r\nopenly, it must necessarily be for the purpose of concealing from Your\r\nMajesty either his ignorance or his wickedrnpss.” [_Memoires de\r\nRichelieu,_ t. ii.  p. 349.] Prudent rules and acute remarks, which\r\nRichelieu, when he became all-powerful, was to forget.\r\n\r\nEighteen months had barely rolled away when Colonel Ornano, lately\r\ncreated a marshal at the Duke of Anjou’s request, was again arrested and\r\ncarried off a prisoner “to the very room where, twenty-four years ago,\r\nMarshal Biron had been confined.”  For some time past “it had been\r\ncurrent at court and throughout the kingdom that a great cabal was going\r\non,” says Richelieu in his _Memoires,_ “and the cabalists said quite\r\nopenly that under his ministry, men might cabal with impunity, for he was\r\nnot a dangerous enemy.”  If the cabalists had been living in that\r\nconfidence, they were most wofully deceived.  Richelieu was neither\r\nmeddlesome nor cruel, but he was stern and pitiless towards the\r\nsufferings as well as the supplications of those who sought to thwart his\r\npolicy.  At this period, he wished to bring about a marriage between the\r\nDuke of Anjou, then eighteen years old, and Mdlle. de Montpensier, the\r\nlate Duke of Montpensier’s daughter, and the richest heiress in France.\r\nThe young prince did not like it.  Madame de Chevreuse, it was said,\r\nseeing the king an invalid and childless, was already anticipating his\r\ndeath, and the possibility of marrying his widowed queen to his\r\nsuccessor.  “I should gain too little by the change,” said Anne of\r\nAustria one day, irritated by the accusations of which she was the\r\nobject.  Divers secret or avowed motives had formed about the Duke of\r\nAnjou what was called the “aversion”  party, who were opposed to his\r\nmarriage; but the arrest of Colonel Ornano dismayed the accomplices for a\r\nwhile.  The Duke of Anjou protested his fidelity to his brother, and\r\npromised the cardinal to place in the king’s hands a written undertaking\r\nto submit his wishes and affections to him.  The intrigue appeared to\r\nhave been abandoned.  But the “_dreadful (epouvantable) faction,_” as the\r\nCardinal calls it in his _Memoires,_ conspired to remove the young prince\r\nfrom the court.  The Duke of Vendome, son of Henry IV. and Gabrielle\r\nd’Estrees, had offered him an asylum in his government of Brittany; but\r\nthe far-sighted policy of the minister took away this refuge from the\r\nheir to the throne, always inclined as he was to put himself at the head\r\nof a party.  The Duke of Vendome and his brother the Grand Prior,\r\ndisquieted at the rumors which were current about them, hastened to go\r\nand visit the king at Blois.  He received them with great marks of\r\naffection.  “Brother,” said he to the Duke of Vendome, laying his hand\r\nupon his shoulder, “I was impatient to see you.”  Next morning, the 15th\r\nof June, the two princes were arrested in bed.  “Ah! brother,” cried\r\nVendome, “did not I tell you in Brittany that we should be arrested?”\r\n “I wish I were dead, and you were there,” said the Grand Prior.  “I told\r\nyou, you know, that the castle of Blois was a fatal place for princes,”\r\n rejoined the duke.  They were conducted to Amboise.  The king,\r\ncontinually disquieted by the projects of assassination hatched against\r\nhis minister, gave him a company of musketeers as guards, and set off for\r\nNantes, whither the cardinal was not slow to go and join him.  In the\r\ninterval, a fresh accomplice in the plot had been discovered.\r\n\r\nThis time it was in the king’s own household that he had been sought and\r\nfound.  Henry de Talleyrand, Count of Chalais, master of the wardrobe,\r\nhare-brained and frivolous, had hitherto made himself talked about only\r\nfor-his duels and his successes with women.  He had already been drawn\r\ninto a plot against the cardinal’s life; but, under the influence of\r\nremorse, he had confessed his criminal intentions to the minister\r\nhimself.  Richelieu appeared touched by the repentance, but he did not\r\nforget the offence, and his watch over this “unfortunate gentleman,” as\r\nhe himself calls him, made him aware before long that Chalais was\r\ncompromised in an intrigue which aimed at nothing less, it was said, than\r\nto secure the person of the cardinal by means an ambush, so as  to rid\r\nhim at need.  Chalais was arrested in his bed on the 8th of July.  The\r\nMarquis la Valette, son of the Duke of Epernon and governor or Metz had\r\nbeen asked to give an asylum to Monsieur in case he decided upon flying\r\nfrom the court, had answered after embarrassed fashion; the cardinal had\r\nhis enemies in a trap He went to call on Monsieur; it was in Richelieu’s\r\nown house, and under pretext of demanding hospitality of him, that the\r\nconspirators calculated upon striking their blow.  “I very much, regret,”\r\n said the cardinal to Gaston, “that your Highness did, not warn me that\r\nyou and your friends meant to do me the honor of coming to sup with me.\r\nI would have exerted myself, to entertain them and receive them to the\r\nbest of my ability.”  [_Journal de Bassompierre,_ t. ii.] Monsieur seemed\r\nto be dumbfounded; he still thought of flight, but Madame de Guise had\r\njust arrived at Nantes with her daughter, Mdlle. de Montpensier; Madame\r\nde Chevreuse had been driven from court; the young prince’s friends had\r\nbeen scared or won over; and President le Coigneux, his most honest\r\nadviser, counselled him get the cardinal’s support with the king.  “That\r\nrascal,” said the president, “gets so sharp an edge on his wits, that it\r\nis necessary to avail one’s self of all sorts of means to undo what he\r\ndoes.”  Monsieur at last gave way, and consented to married, provided\r\nthat the king would treat it as appanage.  Louis XIII., in his turn,\r\nhesitated, being attracted by the arguments of certain underlings, “folks\r\never welcome, as being apparently out of the region of political\r\ninterests, and seeming to have an eye in everything to their master’s\r\nperson only.”  They represented to the king that if the Duke of Anjou\r\nwere to have children, he would become of more importance in the country,\r\nwhich would be to the king’s detriment.  The minister, boldly demanded of\r\nthe king the dismissal of “those petty folks who insolently abused his\r\near.”  Louis XIII., in his turn gave way; and on the 5th of August, 1626,\r\nthe cardinal celebrated the marriage of Gaston, who became Duke of\r\nOrleans on, the occasion, with Mary of Bourbon, Mdlle. de Montpesier.\r\n“No viols or music were heard that day and it was said in the\r\nbridegroom’s circle that there was no occassion for having Monsieur’s\r\nmarriage stained with blood.  This was reported,to the king, and to the\r\ncardinal who did not at all like it.”\r\n\r\nWhen Chalais, in his prison, heard of the marriage, he undoubtedly\r\nconceived some hope of a pardon, for he exclaimed, as the cardinal\r\nhimself says, “That is a mighty sharp trick, to have not only scattered a\r\ngreat faction, but, by removing its object, to have annihilated all hopes\r\nof re-uniting it.  Only the sagacity of the king and his minister could\r\nhave made such a hit; it was well done to have caught Monsieur between\r\ntouch-and-go (_entre bond et volee_).  The prince, when he knows of this,\r\nwill be very vexed, though he do not say so, and the count (of Soissons,\r\nnephew of Conde) will weep over it with his mother.”\r\n\r\nThe hopes of Chalais were deceived.  He had written to the king to\r\nconfess his fault.  “I was only thirteen days in the faction,” he said;\r\nbut those thirteen days were enough to destroy him.  In vain did his\r\nfriends intercede passionately for him; in vain did his mother write to\r\nthe king the most touching letter.  “I gave him to you, sir, at eight\r\nyears of age; he is a grandson of Marshal Montluc and President Jeannin;\r\nhis family serve you daily, but dare not throw themselves at your feet\r\nfor fear of displeasing you; nevertheless, they join with me in begging\r\nof you the life of this wretch, though he should have to end his days in\r\nperpetual imprisonment, or in serving you abroad.”  Chalais was condemned\r\nto death on the 18th of August, 1626, by the criminal court established\r\nat Nantes for that purpose; all the king’s mercy went no farther than a\r\nremission of the tortures which should have accompanied th execution.  He\r\nsent one of his friends to assure his mother of his repentance.  “Tell\r\nhim,” answered the noble lady, that I am very glad to have the\r\nconsolation he gives me of, his dying in God; if I did not think that the\r\nsight of me would be too much for him, I would go to him and not leave\r\nhim until his head was severed from his body; but, being unable to be of\r\nany help to him in that way, I am going to pray God for him.”  And she\r\nreturned into the church of the nuns of Sainte-Claire.  The friends of\r\nChalais had managed to have the executioner carried off, so as to retard\r\nhis execution; but an inferior criminal, to whom pardon had been granted\r\nfor the performance of this service, cut off the unfortunate culprit’s\r\nhead in thirty-one strokes.  [_Memoires d’un Favori du Duc d’ Orleans\r\n(Archives curieuses de l’Histoire de France),_ 2d series, t. iii.] “The\r\nsad news was brought to the Duke of Orleans, who was playing abbot; he\r\ndid not leave the game, and went on as if instead of death he had heard\r\nof deliverance.”  An example of cruelty which might well have discouraged\r\nthe friends of the Duke of Orleans “from dying a martyr’s death for him”\r\n like the unhappy Chalais.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Richelieu was neither meddlesome nor cruel, but\r\nthat he was stern and pitiless; and he gave proof of that the following\r\nyear, on an occasion when his personal interests were not in any way at\r\nstake.  At the outset of his ministry, in 1624, he had obtained from the\r\nking a severe ordinance against duels--a fatal custom which was at that\r\ntime decimating the noblesse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Double Duel----188]\r\n\r\nAlready several noblemen, amongst others M. du Plessis-Praslin, had been\r\ndeprived of their offices or sent into exile in consequence of their\r\nduels, when M. de Bouteville, of the house of Montmorency, who had been\r\npreviously engaged in twenty-one affairs of honor, came to Paris to fight\r\nthe Marquis of Beuvron on the _Place Royale_.  The Marquis’s second, M.\r\nde fussy d’Amboise, was killed by the Count of Chapelles, Bouteville’s\r\nsecond.  Beuvron fled to England.  M. de Bouteville and his comrade had\r\ntaken post for Lorraine; they were recognized and arrested at Vitry-le-\r\nBrule and brought back to Paris; and the king immediately ordered\r\nParliament to bring them to trial.  The crime was flagrant and the\r\ndefiance of the kings orders undeniable; but\r\nthe culprit was connected with the greatest houses in the kingdom; he had\r\ngiven striking proofs of bravery in the king’s service; and all the court\r\ninterceded for him.  Parliament, with regret, pronounced condemnation,\r\nabsolving the memory of Bussy d’Amboise, who was a son of President De\r\nMesmes’s wife, and reducing to one third of their goods the confiscation\r\nto which the condemned were sentenced.  “Parliament has played the king,”\r\n was openly said in the queen’s ante-chamber; “if the things proceed to\r\nexecution, the king will play Parliament.”\r\n\r\nThe cardinal was much troubled in spirit,” says he himself it was\r\nimpossible to have a noble heart and not pity this poor gentleman, whose\r\nyouth and courage excited so much compassion.”  However, whilst\r\nexpounding, according to his practice, to the king the reasons for and\r\nagainst the execution of the culprits, Richelieu let fall this astounding\r\nexpression: “It is a question of breaking the neck of duels or of your\r\nMajesty’s edicts.”\r\n\r\nLouis XIII. did not hesitate: though less stern than his brother, he was,\r\nmore indifferent, and “the love he bore his kingdom prevailed over his\r\ncompassion for these two gentlemen.”  Both died with courage.  “There was\r\nno sign of anything weak in their words or mean in their actions.  They\r\nreceived the news that they were to die with the same visage as they\r\nwould have that of pardon,”  “in such sort that they who had lived like\r\ndevils were seen dying like saints, and they who had cared for nothing\r\nbut to foment duels serving towards the extinction of them.”  [_Memoires\r\nd’un Favori du Due d’ Orleans (Archives curieuses de l’Histoire de\r\nFrance),_ t.  ii.]\r\n\r\nThe cardinal had got Chalais condemned as a conspirator; he had let\r\nBouteville be executed as a duellist; the greatest lords bent beneath his\r\nauthority, but the power that depends on a king’s favor is always menaced\r\nand tottering.  The enemies of Richelieu had not renounced the idea of\r\noverthrowing him; their hopes even went on growing, since, for some time\r\npast the queen-mother had  been waxin jealous of the all powerful\r\nminister, and no longer made common cause with him.  The king had\r\nreturned in triumph from the siege of La Rochelle; the queen-mother hoped\r\nto retain him by her at court; but the cardinal, ever on the watch over\r\nthe movements of Spain, prevailed upon Louis XIII. to support his\r\nsubject, the Duke of Nevers, legitimate heir to Mantua and Montferrat, of\r\nwhich the Spaniards were besieging the capital.  The army began to march,\r\nbut the queen designedly retarded the movements of her son.  The cardinal\r\nwas appointed generalissimo, and the king, who had taken upon himself the\r\noccupation of Savoy, was before long obliged by his health to return to\r\nLyons, where he fell seriously ill.  The two queens hurried to his\r\nbedside; and they were seconded by the keeper of the seals, M. de\r\nMarillac, but lately raised to power by Richelieu as a man on whom he\r\ncould depend, and now completely devoted to the queen-mother’s party.\r\n\r\nAt the news of the king’s danger, the cardinal quitted St. Jean-de-\r\nMaurienne for a precipitate journey to Lyons; but he was soon obliged to\r\nreturn to his army.  During the king’s convalescence, the resentment of\r\nthe queen-mother against the minister, as well as that of Anne of\r\nAustria, had free course; and when the royal train took the road slowly\r\nback to Paris, in the month of October, the ruin of the cardinal had been\r\nresolved upon.\r\n\r\nWhat a trip was that descent of the Loire from Roanne to Briare in the\r\nsame boat and “at very close quarters between the queen-mother and the\r\ncardinal!” says Bassompierre.  “She hoped that she would more easily be\r\nable to have her will, and crush her servant with the more facility, the\r\nless he was on his guard against it; she looked at him with a kindly eye,\r\naccepted his dutiful attentions and respects as usual, and spoke to him\r\nwith as much appearance of confidence as if she had wholly given it him.”\r\n [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. iii.  pp. 303-305.]\r\n\r\nThe king had requested his mother “to put off for six weeks or two months\r\nthe grand move against the cardinal, for the sake of the affairs of his\r\nkingdom, which were then at a crisis in Italy” [_Memoires de\r\nBassompierre,_ t. iii.  p. 276], and she had promised him; but Richelieu\r\n“suspected something wrong, and discovered more,” and, on the 12th of\r\nNovember, 1630, when mother and son were holding an early conference at\r\nthe Luxembourg, a fine palace which Mary de’ Medici had just finished,\r\n“the cardinal arrived there; finding the door of the chamber closed, he\r\nentered the gallery and went and knocked at the door of the cabinet,\r\nwhere he obtained no answer.  Tired of waiting, and knowing the ins and\r\nouts of the mansion, he entered by the little chapel; whereat the king\r\nwas somewhat dismayed, and said to the queen in despair, ‘Here he is!’\r\nthinking, no doubt, that he would blaze forth.  The cardinal, who\r\nperceived this dismay, said to them, ‘I am sure you were speaking about\r\nme.’  The queen answered, ‘We were not.’  Whereupon, he having replied,\r\n‘Confess it, madam,’ she said yes, and thereupon conducted herself with\r\ngreat tartness towards him, declaring to the king ‘that she would not put\r\nup with the cardinal any longer, or see in her house either him or any of\r\nhis relatives and friends, to whom she incontinently gave their\r\ndismissal, and not to them only, but even down to the pettiest of her\r\nofficers who had come to her from his hands.’” [_Memoires de Richelieu,_\r\nt. iii.  p. 428.]\r\n\r\nThe struggle was begun.  Already the courtiers were flocking to the\r\nLuxembourg; the keeper of the seals, Marillac, had gone away to sleep at\r\nhis country-house at Glatigny, quite close to Versailles, where the king\r\nwas expected; and he was hoping that Louis XIII. would summon him and put\r\nthe power in his hands.  The king was chatting with his favorite St.\r\nSimon, and tapping with his finger-tips on the window-pane.  “What do you\r\nthink of all this?” he asked.  “Sir,” was the reply, “I seem to be in\r\nanother world, but at any rate you are master.”  “Yes, I am,” answered\r\nthe king, “and I will make it felt too.”  He sent for Cardinal La\r\nVallette, son of the Duke of Epernon, but devoted to Richelieu.  “The\r\ncardinal has a good master,” he said: “go and make my compliments to him,\r\nand tell him to come to me without delay.”  [Memoires de Bassompierre,\r\nt. iii.  p. 276.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Tapping with his Finger-tips on the Window-pane.”----191]\r\n\r\nWith all his temper and the hesitations born of his melancholy mind,\r\nLouis XIII. could appreciate and discern the great interests of his\r\nkingdom and of his power.  The queen had supposed that the king would\r\nabandon the cardinal, and “that her private authority as mother, and the\r\npious affection and honor the king showed her as her son, would prevail\r\nover the public care which he ought, as king, to take of his kingdom and\r\nhis people.  But God, who holds in His hand the hearts of princes,\r\ndisposed things otherwise: his Majesty resolved to defend his servant\r\nagainst the malice of those who prompted the queen to this wicked\r\ndesign.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu._]  He conversed a long while with the\r\ncardinal, and when the keeper of the seals awoke the next morning, it was\r\nto learn that the minister was at Versailles with the king, who had\r\nlodged him in a room under his own, that his Majesty demanded the seals\r\nback, and that the exons were at his, Marillac’s, door to secure his\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nAt the same time was despatched a courier to headquarters at Foglizzo in\r\nPiedmont.  The three marshals Schomberg, La Force, and Marillac, had all\r\nformed a junction there.  Marillac, brother of the keeper of the seals,\r\nheld the command that day; and he was awaiting with patience the news,\r\nalready announced by his brother, of the cardinal’s disgrace.  Marshal\r\nSchomberg opened the despatches; and the first words that met his eye\r\nwere these, written in the king’s own hand: “My dear cousin, you will not\r\nfail to arrest Marshal Marillac; it is for the good of my service and for\r\nyour own exculpation.”  The marshal was greatly embarrassed; a great part\r\nof the troops had come with Marillac from the army of Champagne and were\r\ndevoted to him.  Schomberg determined, on the advice of Marshal La Force,\r\nin full council of captains, to show Marillac the postcript.  “Sir,”\r\n answered the marshal, “a subject must not murmur against his master,\r\nnor say of him that the things he alleges are false.  I can protest with\r\ntruth that I have done nothing contrary to his service.  The truth is,\r\nthat my brother the keeper of the seals and I have always been the\r\nservants of the queen-mother; she must have had the worst of it, and\r\nCardinal Richelieu has won the day against her and her servants.”\r\n [_Memoires de Puy-Seyur._]\r\n\r\nThus arrested in the very midst of the army he commanded, Marshal\r\nMarillac was taken to the castle of St. Menehould and thence to Verdun,\r\nwhere a court of justice extraordinary sat upon his case.  It was cleared\r\nof any political accusation: the marshal was prosecuted for peculation\r\nand extortion, common crimes at that time with many generals, and always\r\nodious to the nation, which regarded their punishment with favor.  “It is\r\na very strange thing,” said Marillac, “to prosecute me as they do; my\r\ntrial is a mere question of hay, straw, wood, stones, and lime; there is\r\nnot case enough for whipping a lackey.”  There was case enough for\r\nsentencing to death a marshal of France.  The proceedings lasted eighteen\r\nmonths; the commission was transferred from Verdun to Ruel, to the very\r\nhouse of the cardinal.  Marillac was found guilty by a majority of one\r\nonly.  The execution took place on the 10th of May, 1632.  The former\r\nkeeper of the seals, Michael de Marillac, died of decline at Chateaudun,\r\nthree months after the death of his brother.\r\n\r\n_Dupes’ Day_ was over and lost.  The queen-mother’s attack on Richelieu\r\nhad failed before the minister’s ascendency and the king’s calculating\r\nfidelity to a servant he did not like; but Mary de’ Medici’s anger was\r\nnot calmed, and the struggle remained set between her and the cardinal.\r\nThe Duke of Orleans, who had lost his wife after a year’s marriage, had\r\nnot hitherto joined his mother’s party, but all on a sudden, excited by\r\nhis grievances, he arrived at the cardinal’s, on the 30th of January,\r\n1631, “with a strong escort, and told him that he would consider it a\r\nstrange purpose that had brought him there; that, so long as he supposed\r\nthat the cardinal would serve him, he had been quite willing to show him\r\namity; now, when he saw that he foiled him in everything that be had\r\npromised, to such extent that the way in which he, Monsieur, had behaved\r\nhimself, had served no end but to make the world believe that he had\r\nabandoned the queen his mother, he had come to take back the word he had\r\ngiven him to show him affection.”  On leaving the cardinal’s house,\r\nMonsieur got into his carriage and went off in haste to Orleans, whilst\r\nthe king, having received notice from Richelieu, was arriving with all\r\ndespatch from Versailles to assure his minister “of his protection, well\r\nknowing that nobody could wish him ill, save for the faithful services he\r\nrendered him.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. ii.  p. 444.]\r\n\r\nThe queen-mother had undoubtedly been aware of the Duke of Orleans’\r\nproject, for she had given up to him Madame’s jewels which he had\r\nconfided to her; she nevertheless sent her equerry to the king,\r\nprotesting “that she had been much astonished when she heard of\r\nMonsieur’s departure, that she had almost fainted on the spot, and that\r\nMonsieur had sent her word that he was going away from court because he\r\ncould no longer tolerate the cardinal’s violent proceedings against her.\r\n\r\n“When the king signified to her that he considered this withdrawal very\r\nstrange, and let her know that he had much trouble in believing that she\r\nknew nothing about it, she took occasion to belch forth fire and flames\r\nagainst the cardinal, and made a fresh attempt to ruin him in the king’s\r\nestimation, though she had previously bound herself by oath to take no\r\nmore steps against him.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. ii.  p. 465.]\r\n\r\nThe cardinal either had not sworn at all or did not consider himself more\r\nbound than the queen by oaths.  Their Majesties set out for Compiegne;\r\nthere the minister brought the affair before the council, explaining with\r\na skilful appearance of indifference the different courses to be taken,\r\nand ending by propounding the question of his own retirement or the\r\nqueen-mother’s.  “His Majesty, without hesitation, made his own choice,\r\ntaking the resolution of returning to Paris and of begging the\r\nqueen-mother to retire for the time being to one of his mansions,\r\nparticularly recommending Moulins, which she had formerly expressed to\r\nthe late king a wish to have; and, in order that she might be the better\r\ncontented with it, he offered her the government of it and of all the\r\nprovince.”  Next day, February 23, 1631, before the queen-mother was up,\r\nher royal son had taken the road back to Paris, leaving Marshal D’Estrees\r\nat Compiegne to explain to the queen his departure and to hasten his\r\nmother’s, a task in which the marshal had but small success, for Mary de’\r\nMedici declared that, if they, meant to make her depart, they would have\r\nto drag her stark naked from her bed.  She kept herself shut up in the\r\ncastle, refusing to go out and complaining of the injury the seclusion\r\ndid to her health; then she fled by night from Compiegne, attended by one\r\ngentleman only, to go and take refuge in Flanders, whence she arrived\r\nbefore long at Brussels.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal’s game was definitively won.  Mary de’ Medici had lost all\r\nempire over her son, whom she was never to see again.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans meanwhile had taken the road to Lorraine, seeking a\r\nrefuge in the dominions of a prince able, crafty, restless, and hostile\r\nto France from inclination as well as policy.  Smitten, before long, with\r\nthe duke’s sister, Princess Margaret, Gaston of Orleans married her\r\nprivately, with a dispensation from the Cardinal of Lorraine, all which\r\ndid not prevent either duke or prince from barefacedly denying the\r\nmarriage when the king reproached them with having contracted this\r\nmarriage without his consent.  In the month of June, 1632, the Duke of\r\nOrleans entered France again at the head of some wretched regiments,\r\nrefuse of the Spanish army, given to him by Don Gonzalvo di Cordova.  For\r\nthe first time, he raised the standard of revolt openly.  For him it was\r\nof little consequence, accustomed as he was to place himself at the head\r\nof parties that he abandoned without shame in the hour of danger; but he\r\ndragged along with him in his error a man worthy of another fate and of\r\nanother chief.  Henry, Duke of Montmorency, marshal of France, and\r\ngovernor of Languedoc, was a godson of Henry IV., who said one day to\r\nM. de Villeroy and to President Jeannin, “Look at my son Montmorency, how\r\nwell made he is; if ever the house of Bourbon came to fail, there is no\r\nfamily in Europe which would so well deserve the crown of France as, his,\r\nwhose great men have always supported it, and even added to it at the\r\nprice of their blood.”  Shining at court as well as in arms, kind and\r\ncharitable, beloved of everybody and adored by his servants, the Duke of\r\nMontmorency had steadily remained faithful to the king up to the fatal\r\nday when the Duke of Orleans entangled him in his hazardous enterprise.\r\nLanguedoc was displeased with Richelieu, who had robbed it of some of its\r\nprivileges; the duke had no difficulty in collecting adherents there; and\r\nhe fancied himself to be already wielding the constable’s sword, five\r\ntimes borne by a Montmorency, when Gaston of Orleans entered France and\r\nLanguedoc sooner than he had been looked for, and with a smaller\r\nfollowing than he had promised.  The eighteen hundred men brought by the\r\nking’s brother did not suffice to re-establish him, with the queen his\r\nmother, in the kingdom; the governor of Languedoc made an appeal to the\r\nEstates then assembled at Pezenas; he was supported by the Bishop of Alby\r\nand by that of Nimes; the province itself proclaimed revolt.  The sums\r\ndemanded by the king were granted to the duke, whom the deputies prayed\r\nto remain faithful to the interests of the province, just as they\r\npromised never to abandon his.  The Archbishop of Narbonne alone opposed\r\nthis rash act; he left the Estates, where he was president, and the duke\r\nmarched out to meet Monsieur as far as Lunel.  “Troops were levied\r\nthroughout the province and the environs as openly as if it had been for\r\nthe king.”  But the regiments were slow in forming; the Duke of Orleans\r\nwished to gain over some of the towns; Narbonne and Montpellier closed\r\ntheir gates.  The bishop’s influence had been counted upon for making\r\nsure of Nimes, and Montmorency everywhere tried to practise on the\r\nHuguenots; “but the Reformed ministers of Nimes, having had advices by\r\nletter from his Majesty, whereby he represented himself to have been\r\nadvertised that the principal design of Monsieur was to excite them of\r\nthe religion styled Reformed, considered themselves bound in their own\r\ndefence to do more than the rest for the king’s service.  They assembled\r\nthe consistory, resolved to die in obedience to him, went to seek the\r\nconsuls and requested them to have the town-council assembled, in order\r\nthat it might be brought to take a similar resolution; which the consuls,\r\ngained over by M. de Montmorency, refused.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_\r\nt. iii.  p. 160.]  Thereupon the ministers sent off in haste to Marshal\r\nLa Force, who had already taken position at Pont-Saint-Esprit with his\r\narmy; and, he having despatched some light horse on the 26th of July, the\r\npeople cried, “Hurrah! for the king!” the bishop was obliged to fly, and\r\nthe town was kept to its allegiance.  “Beaucaire, the governor of which\r\nhad been won over,” made armed resistance.  “If we beat the king’s army,”\r\n said the Duke of Montmorency on returning to Pezenas after this incident,\r\n“we shall have no lack of towns; if not, we shall have to go and make our\r\ncourt at Brussels.”\r\n\r\nAt the news of his brother’s revolt, the king, who happened to be on the\r\nfrontiers of Lorraine, had put himself in motion, but he marched at his\r\nease and by short stages, “thinking that the fire Monsieur would kindle\r\nwould be only a straw fire.”\r\n\r\nHe hurried his movements when he heard of Montmorency’s uprising, and\r\nleft Paris after having put the seals upon the duke’s house, who had\r\nimprudently left five hundred and fifty thousand livres there; the money\r\nwas seized and lodged in the royal safe.  The Princess of Guemene,\r\nbetween whom and Montmorency there were very strong ties, went to see the\r\ncardinal, who was in attendance on the king.  “Sir,” she said to him,\r\n“you are going to Languedoc; remember the great marks of attachment that\r\nM. de Montmorency showed you not long ago; you cannot forget then without\r\ningratitude.”  Indeed, when the king believed himself to be dying at\r\nLyons, he had recommended the cardinal to the Duke of Montmorency, who\r\nhad promised to receive him into his government.  “Madam,” replied\r\nRichelieu coldly, “I have not been the first to break off.”\r\n\r\nAlready the Parliament of Toulouse, remaining faithful to the king, had\r\nannulled the resolutions of the Estates, the letters and commissions of\r\nthe governor; and the Parliament of Paris had just enregistered a\r\nresolution against the servants and adherents of the Duke of Orleans, as\r\nrebels guilty of high treason and disturbers of the common peace.  Six\r\nweeks were granted the king’s brother to put an end to all acts of\r\nhostility; else the king was resolved to decree against him, after that\r\ninterval of delay, “whatsoever he should consider it his duty to do for\r\nthe preservation of his kingdom, according to the laws of the realm and\r\nthe example of his predecessors.”\r\n\r\nIt was against Marshal Schomberg that Montmorency was advancing.  The\r\nlatter found himself isolated in his revolt, shut up within the limits of\r\nhis government, between the two armies of the king, who was marching in\r\nperson against him.  Calculations had been based upon an uprising of\r\nseveral provinces and the adhesion of several governors, amongst others\r\nof the aged Duke of Epernon, who had sent to Monsieur to say, “I am his\r\nvery humble servant; let him place himself in a position to be served;”\r\n but no one moved, the king every day received fresh protestations of\r\nfidelity, and the Duke of Epernon had repaired to Montauban to keep that\r\nrestless city to its duty, and to prevent any attempt from being made in\r\nthe province.\r\n\r\nAt three leagues’ distance from Castelnaudary, Marshal Schomberg was\r\nbesieging a castle called St.  Felix-de-Carmain, which held out for the\r\nDuke of Orleans.  Montmorency advanced to the aid of the place; he had\r\ntwo thousand foot and three thousand horse; and the Duke of Orleans\r\naccompanied him with a large number of gentlemen.  The marshal had won\r\nover the defenders of St. Felix, and he was just half a league from\r\nCastelnaudary when he encountered the rebel army.  The battle began\r\nalmost at once.  Count de Moret, natural son of Henry IV. and Jacqueline\r\nde Bueil, fired the first shot.  Hearing the noise, Montmorency, who\r\ncommanded the right wing, takes a squadron of cavalry, and, “urged on by\r\nthat impetuosity which takes possession of all brave men at the like\r\njuncture, he spurs his horse forward, leaps the ditch which was across\r\nthe road, rides over the musketeers, and, the mishap of finding himself\r\nalone causing him to feel more indignation than fear, he makes up his\r\nmind to signalize by his resistance a death which he cannot avoid.”  Only\r\na few gentlemen had followed him, amongst others an old officer named\r\nCount de Rieux, who had promised to die at his feet and he kept his word.\r\nIn vain had Montmorency called to him his men-at-arms and the regiment of\r\nVentadour; the rest of the cavalry did not budge.  Count de Moret had\r\nbeen killed; terror was everywhere taking possession of the men.  The\r\nduke was engaged with the king’s light horse; he had just received two\r\nbullets in his mouth.  His horse, “a small barb, extremely swift,” came\r\ndown with him and he fell wounded in seventeen places, alone, without a\r\nsingle squire to help him.  A sergeant of a company of the guards saw him\r\nfall, and carried him into the road; some soldiers who were present burst\r\nout crying; they seemed to be lamenting their general’s rather than their\r\nprisoner’s misfortune.  Montmorency alone remained as if insensible to\r\nthe blows of adversity, and testified by the grandeur of his courage that\r\nin him it had its seat in a place higher than the heart.”  [_Journal du\r\nDuc de Montmorency (Archives curieuses de l’Histoire de France),_ t. iv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry, Duke of Montmorency, at Castelnaudary----199]\r\n\r\nWhilst the army of the Duke of Orleans was retiring, carrying off their\r\ndead, nearly all of the highest rank, the king’s men were bearing away\r\nMontnmorency, mortally wounded, to Castelnaudary.  His wife, Mary Felicia\r\ndes Ursins, daughter of the Duke of Bracciano, being ill in bed at\r\nBeziers, sent him a doctor, together with her equerry, to learn the truth\r\nabout her husband’s condition.  “Thou’lt tell my wife,” said the duke,\r\n“the number and greatness of the wounds thou hast seen, and thou’lt\r\nassure her that it which I have caused her spirit is incomparably more\r\npainful, to me than all the others.”  On passing through the faubourgs of\r\nthe town, the duke desired that his litter should be opened, “and the\r\nserenity that shone through the pallor of his visage moved the feelings\r\nof all present, and forced tears from the stoutest and the most stolid.”\r\n [_Journal du Due de Montmorency (Archives curieuses de l’Histoire de\r\nFrance)_, t.  iv.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans did not lack the courage of the soldier; he would\r\nfain have rescued Montmorency and sought to rally his forces; but the\r\ntroops of Languedoc would obey none but the governor; the foreigners\r\nmutinied, and the king’s brother had no longer an army.  “Next day, when\r\nit was too late,” says Richelieu, “Monsieur sent a trumpeter to demand\r\nbattle of Marshal Schomberg, who replied that he would not give it, but\r\nthat, if he met him, he would try to defend himself against him.”\r\n Monsieur considered himself absolved from seeking the combat, and\r\nhenceforth busied himself about nothing but negotiation.  Alby, Beziers,\r\nand Pezenas hastened to give in their submission.  It was necessary for\r\nthe Duchess of Montmorency, ill and in despair, to quicken her departure\r\nfrom Beziers, where she was no longer safe.  “As she passed along the\r\nstreets she heard nothing but a confusion of voices amongst the people,\r\nspeaking insolently of those who would withdraw in apprehension.”  The\r\nking was already at Lyons.\r\n\r\nHe was at Pont-Saint-Esprit when he sent a message to his brother, from\r\nwhom he had already received emissaries on the road.  The first demands\r\nof Gaston d’Orleans were still proud; he required the release of\r\nMontmorency, the rehabilitation of all those who had served his party and\r\nhis mother’s, places of surety and money.  The king took no notice; and\r\na second envoy from the prince was put in prison.  Meanwhile, the\r\nsuperintendent of finance, M. de Bullion, had reached him from the king,\r\nand “found the mind of Monsieur very penitent and well disposed, but not\r\nthat of all the rest, for Monsieur confessed that he had been ill-advised\r\nto behave as he did at the cardinal’s house, and afterwards leave the\r\ncourt; acknowledging himself to be much obliged to the king for the\r\nclemency he had shown to him in his proclamation, which had touched him\r\nto the heart, and that he was bounden therefor to the cardinal, whom he\r\nhad always liked and esteemed, and believed that he also on his side\r\nliked him.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. viii.  p. 196.]\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Montmorency knew Monsieur, although she, it was said,\r\nhad pressed her husband to join him; and all ill as she was, had been\r\nfollowing him ever since the battle of Castelnaudary, in the fear lest he\r\nshould forget her husband in the treaty.  She could not, unfortunately,\r\nenter Beziers, and it was there that the arrangements were concluded.\r\nMonsieur protested his repentance, cursing in particular Father\r\nChanteloube, confessor and confidant of the queen his mother, “whom he\r\nwished the king would have hanged; he had given pretty counsel to the\r\nqueen, causing her to leave the kingdom; for all the great hopes he had\r\nled her to conceive, she was reduced to relieve her weariness by praying\r\nto God.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. viii.  p. 196.]  As for Monsieur,\r\nhe was ready to give up all intelligence with Spain, Lorraine, and the\r\nqueen his mother, “who could negotiate her business herself.”  He bound\r\nhimself to take no interest “in him or those who had connected themselves\r\nwith him on these occasions for their own purposes, and he would not\r\ncomplain should the king make them suffer what they had deserved.”  It is\r\ntrue that he added to these base concessions many entreaties in favor of\r\nM. de Montmorency; but M. de Bullion did not permit him to be under any\r\ndelusion.  “It is for your Highness to choose,” he said, “whether or not\r\nyou prefer to cling to the interests of M. de Montmorency, displease the\r\nking and lose his good graces.”  The prince signed everything; then he\r\nset out for Tours, which the king had assigned for his residence,\r\nreceiving on the way, from town to town, all the honors that would have\r\nbeen paid to his Majesty himself.  M. de Montmorency remained in prison.\r\n\r\n“He awaited death with a resignation which is inconceivable,” says the\r\nauthor of his _Memoires;_ “never did man speak more boldly than he about\r\nit; it seemed as if he were recounting another’s perils when he described\r\nhis own to his servants and his guards, who were the only witnesses of\r\nsuch lofty manliness.”  His sister, the Princess of Conde, had a memorial\r\nprepared for his defence put before him.  He read it carefully, then he\r\ntore it up, “having always determined,” he said, “not to (chicaner) go\r\npettifogging for (or, dispute) his life.”  “I ought by rights to answer\r\nbefore the Parliament of Paris only,” said he to the commission of the\r\nParliament of Toulouse instructed to conduct his trial, “but I give up\r\nwith all my heart this privilege and all others that might delay my\r\nsentence.”\r\n\r\nThere was not long to wait for the decree.  On arriving at Toulouse,\r\nOctober 27, at noon, the duke had asked for a confessor.  “Father,” said\r\nhe to the priest, “I pray you to put me this moment in the shortest and\r\nmost certain path to heaven that you can, having nothing more to hope or\r\nwish for but God.”  All his family had hurried up, but without being able\r\nto obtain the favor of seeing the king.  “His Majesty had strengthened\r\nhimself in the resolution he had taken from the first to make in the case\r\nof the said Sieur de Montmorency a just example for all the grandees of\r\nhis kingdom in the future, as the late king his father had done in the\r\nperson of Marshal Biron,” says Richelieu in his Memoires.  The Princess\r\nof Conde could not gain admittance to his Majesty, who lent no ear to\r\nthe supplications of his oldest servants, represented by the aged Duke of\r\nEpernon, who accused himself by his own mouth of having but lately\r\ncommitted the same crime as the Duke of Montmorency.  “You can retire,\r\nduke,” was all that Louis XIII. deigned to reply.  “I should not be a\r\nking if I had the feelings of private persons,” said he to Marshal\r\nChatillon, who pointed out to him the downcast looks and swollen eyes of\r\nall his court.\r\n\r\nIt was the 30th of October, early: and the Duke of Montmorency was\r\nsleeping peacefully.  His confessor came and awoke him.  “_Surgite,\r\neamus_ (rise, let us be going),” he said, as he awoke; and when his\r\nsurgeon would have dressed his wounds, “Now is the time to heal all my\r\nwounds with a single one,” he said, and he had himself dressed in the\r\nclothes of white linen he had ordered to be made at Lectoure for the day\r\nof execution.  When the last questions were put to him by the judges, he\r\nanswered by a complete confession; and when the decree was made known to\r\nhim, “I thank you, gentlemen,” said he to the commissioners, “and I beg\r\nyou to tell all them of your body from me, that I hold this decree of the\r\nking’s justice for a decree of God’s mercy.”  He walked to the scaffold\r\nwith the same tranquillity, saluting right and left those whom he knew,\r\nto take leave of them; then, having with difficulty placed himself upon\r\nthe block, so much did his wounds still cause him to suffer, he said out\r\nloud, “_Domine Jesu, accipe spiritum meum (Lord Jesus, receive my\r\nspirit)!_”  As his head fell, the people rushed forward to catch his\r\nblood and dip their handkerchiefs in it.\r\n\r\nHenry de Montmorency was the last of the ducal branch of his house, and\r\nwas only thirty-seven.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine opportunity for Monsieur to once more break his\r\nengagements.  Shame and anxiety drove him equally.  He was universally\r\nreproached with Montmorency’s death; and he was by no means easy on the\r\nsubject of his marriage, of which no mention had been made in the\r\narrangements.  He quitted Tours and withdrew to Flanders, writing to the\r\nking to complain of the duke’s execution, saying that the life of the\r\nlatter had been the tacit condition of his agreement, and that, his\r\npromise being thus not binding, he was about to seek a secure retreat out\r\nof the kingdom.  “Everybody knows in what plight you were, brother, and\r\nwhether you could have done anything else,” replied the king.\r\n\r\n“What think you, gentlemen, was it that lost the Duke of Montmorency his\r\nhead?” said Cardinal Zapata to Bautru and Barrault, envoys of France,\r\nwhom he met in the antechamber of the King of Spain.  “His crimes,”\r\n replied Bautru.  “No,” said the cardinal, “but the clemency of his\r\nMajesty’s predecessors.”  Louis XIII. and Cardinal Richelieu have\r\nassuredly not merited that, reproach in history.\r\n\r\nSo many and such terrible examples were at last to win the all-powerful\r\nminister some years of repose.  Once only, in 1636, a new plot on the\r\npart of Monsieur and the Count of Soissons threatened not only his power,\r\nbut his life.  The king’s headquarters were established at the castle of\r\nDemuin; and the princes, urged on by Montresor and Saint-Ibal, had\r\nresolved to compass the cardinal’s death.  The blow was to be struck at\r\nthe exit from the council.  Richelieu conducted the king back to the\r\nbottom of the staircase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The King and the Cardinal----204]\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen were awaiting the signal; but Monsieur did not budge,\r\nand retired without saying a word.  The Count of Soissons dared not go\r\nany further, and the cardinal mounted quietly to his own rooms, without\r\ndreaming of the extreme peril he had run.  Richelieu was rather lofty\r\nthan proud, and too clear-sighted to mistake the king’s feelings towards\r\nhim.  Never did he feel any confidence in his position; and never did he\r\ndepart from his jealous and sometimes petty watchfulness.  Any influence\r\nforeign to his own disquieted him in proximity to a master whose affairs\r\nhe governed altogether, without ever having been able to get the mastery\r\nover his melancholy and singular mind.\r\n\r\nWomen filled but a small space in the life of Louis XIII.  Twice,\r\nhowever, in that interval of ten years which separated the plot of\r\nMontmorency from that of Cinq-Mars, did the minister believe himself to\r\nbe threatened by feminine influence; and twice he used artifice to win\r\nthe monarch’s heart and confidence from two young girls of his court,\r\nLouise de La Fayette and Marie d’Hautefort.  Both were maids of honor to\r\nthe queen.  Mdlle. d’Hautefort was fourteen years old when, in 1630, at\r\nLyons, in the languors of convalescence, the king first remarked her\r\nblooming and at the same time severe beauty, and her air of nobility and\r\nmodesty; and it was not long before the whole court knew that he had\r\nremarked her, for his first care, at the sermon, was to send the young\r\nmaid of honor the velvet cushion on which he knelt for her to sit upon.\r\nMdlle. d’Hautefort declined it, and remained seated, like her companions,\r\non the ground; but henceforth the courtiers’ eyes were riveted on her\r\nmovements, on the interminable conversations in which she was detained by\r\nthe king, on his jealousies, his tiffs, and his reconciliations.  After\r\ntheir quarrels, the king would pass the greater part of the day in\r\nwriting out what he had said to Mdlle. d’Hautefort and what she had\r\nreplied to him.  At his death, his desk was found full of these singular\r\nreports of the most innocent, but also most stormy and most troublesome\r\nlove-affair that ever was.  The king was especially jealous of Mdlle.\r\nd’Hautefort’s passionate devotion to the queen her mistress, Anne of\r\nAustria.  “You love an ingrate,” he said, “and you will see how she will\r\nrepay your services.”  Richelieu had been unable to win Mdlle.\r\nd’Hautefort; and he did his best to embitter the tiff which separated\r\nher from the king in 1635.  But Louis XIII. had learned the charm of\r\nconfidence and intimacy; and he turned to Louise de La Fayette, a\r\ncharming girl of seventeen, who was as virtuous as Mdlle. d’Hautefort,\r\nbut more gentle and tender than she, and who gave her heart in all\r\nguilelessness to that king so powerful, so a-weary, and so melancholy at\r\nthe very climax of his reign.  Happily for Richelieu, he had a means,\r\nmore certain than even Mdlle. d’Hautefort’s pride, of separating her from\r\nLouis XIII.; Mdlle.  de La Fayette, whilst quite a child, had serious\r\nideas of becoming a nun; and scruples about being false to her vocation\r\ntroubled her at court, and even in those conversations in which she\r\nreproached herself with taking too much pleasure, Father Coussin, her\r\nconfessor, who was also the king’s, sought to quiet her conscience; he\r\nhoped much from the influence she could exercise over the king; but\r\nMdlle. de La Fayette, feeling herself troubled and perplexed, was urgent.\r\nWhen the Jesuit reported to Louis XIII. the state of his fair young\r\nfriend’s feelings, the king, with tears in his eyes, replied, “Though I\r\nam very sorry she is going away, nevertheless I have no desire to be an\r\nobstacle to her vocation; only let her wait until I have left for the\r\narmy.”  She did not wait, however.  Their last interview took place at\r\nthe queen’s, who had no liking for Mdlle. de La Fayette; and, as the\r\nking’s carriage went out of the court-yard, the young girl, leaning\r\nagainst the window, turned to one of her companions and said, “Alas! I\r\nshall never see him again!”  But she did see him again often for some\r\ntime.  He went to see her in her convent, and “remained so long glued to\r\nher grating,” says Madame de Motteville, that Cardinal Richelieu, falling\r\na prey to fresh terrors, recommenced his intrigues to tear him from her\r\nentirely.  And he succeeded.”  The king’s affection for Mdlle.\r\nd’Hautefort awoke again.  She had just rendered the queen an important\r\nservice.  Anne of Austria was secretly corresponding with her two\r\nbrothers, King Philip IV. and the Cardinal Infante, a correspondence\r\nwhich might well make the king and his minister uneasy, since it was\r\ncarried on through Madame de Chevreuse, and there was war at the time\r\nwith Spain.  The queen employed for this intercourse a valet named\r\nLaporte, who was arrested and thrown into prison.  The chancellor removed\r\nto Val-de-Grace, whither the queen frequently retired; he questioned the\r\nnuns and rummaged Anne of Austria’s cell.  She was in mortal anxiety, not\r\nknowing what Laporte might say or how to unloose his tongue, so as to\r\nkeep due pace with her own confessions to the king and the cardinal.\r\nMdlle. d’Hautefort disguised herself as a servant, went straight to the\r\nBastille, and got a letter delivered to Laporte, thanks to the agency of\r\nCommander de Jars, her friend, then in prison.  The confessions of\r\nmistress and agent being thus set in accord, the queen obtained her\r\npardon, but not without having to put up with reproaches and conditions\r\nof stern supervision.  Madame de Chevreuse took fright, and went to seek\r\nrefuge in Spain.  The king’s inclination towards Mdlle. d’Hautefort\r\nrevived, without her having an idea of turning it to profit on her own\r\naccount.  “She had so much loftiness of spirit that she could never have\r\nbrought herself to ask anything for herself and her family; and all that\r\ncould be wrung from her was to accept what the king and queen were\r\npleased to give her.”\r\n\r\nRichelieu had never forgotten Mdlle. d’Hautefort’s airs: he feared her,\r\nand accused her to the king of being concerned in Monsieur’s continual\r\nintrigues.  Louis XIII.’s growing affection for young Cinq-Mars, son of\r\nMarshal d’Effiat, was beginning to occupy the gloomy monarch; and he the\r\nmore easily sacrificed Mdlle. d’Hautefort.  The cardinal merely asked him\r\nto send her away for a fortnight.  She insisted upon hearing the order\r\nfrom the king’s own mouth.  “The fortnight will last all the rest of my\r\nlife,” she said: “and so I take leave of your Majesty forever.”  She went\r\naccompanied by the regrets and tears of Anne of Austria, and leaving the\r\nfield open to the new favorite, the king’s “rattle,” as the cardinal\r\ncalled him.\r\n\r\nM. de Cinq-Mars was only nineteen when he was made master of the wardrobe\r\nand grand equerry of France.  Brilliant and witty, he amused the king and\r\noccupied the leisure which peace gave him.  The passion Louis XIII. felt\r\nfor his favorite was jealous and capricious.  He upbraided the young man\r\nfor his flights to Paris to see his friends and the elegant society of\r\nthe Marais, and sometimes also Mary di Gonzaga, daughter of the Duke of\r\nMantua, wooed but lately by the Duke of Orleans, and not indifferent, it\r\nwas said, to the vows of M. Le Grand, as Cinq-Mars was called.  The\r\ncomplaints were detailed to Richelieu by the king himself in a strange\r\ncorrespondence, which reminds one of the “reports” of his quarrels with\r\nMdlle. d’Hautefort.  “I am very sorry,” wrote Louis XIII. on the 4th of\r\nJanuary, 1641, “to trouble you about the ill tempers of M. Le Grand.  I\r\nupbraided him with his heedlessness; he answered that for that matter he\r\ncould not change, and that he should do no better than he had done.  I\r\nsaid that, considering his obligations to me, he ought not to address me\r\nin that manner.  He answered in his usual way: that he didn’t want my\r\nkindness, that he could do very well without it, and that he would be\r\nquite as well content to be Cinq-Mars as M. Le Grand, but, as for\r\nchanging his ways and his life, he couldn’t do it.  And so, he\r\ncontinually knagging at me and I at him, we came as far as the\r\ncourt-yard, when I said to him that, being in the temper he was in, he\r\nwould do me the pleasure of not coming to see me.  I have not seen him\r\nsince.  Signed, Louis.”  This time the cardinal reconciled the king and\r\nthe favorite, whom he had himself placed near him, but whose constant\r\nattendance upon the king his master he was beginning to find sometimes\r\nvery troublesome.  “One day he sent word to him not to be for the future\r\nso continually at his heels, and treated him even to his face with so\r\nmuch tartness and imperiousness as if he had been the lowest of his\r\nvalets.”  Cinq-Mars began to lend an ear to those who were egging him on\r\nagainst the cardinal.\r\n\r\nThen began a series of negotiations and intrigues; the Duke of Orleans\r\nhad come back to Paris, the king was ill and the cardinal more so than\r\nhe; thence arose conjectures and insensate hopes; the Duke of Bouillon,\r\nbeing sent for by the king, who confided to him the command of the army\r\nof Italy, was at the same time drawn into the plot which was beginning to\r\nbe woven against the minister; the Duke of Orleans and the queen were in\r\nit; and the town of Sedan, of which Bouillon was prince-sovereign, was\r\nwanted to serve the authors of the conspiracy as an asylum in case of\r\nreverse.  Sedan alone was not sufficient; there was need of an army.\r\nWhence was it to come?  Thoughts naturally turned towards Spain.\r\n\r\nFor so perilous a treaty a negotiator was required, and the grand equerry\r\nproposed his friend, Viscount de Fontrailles, a man of wit, who detested\r\nthe cardinal, and who would have considered it a simpler plan to\r\nassassinate him; he consented, however, to take charge of the\r\nnegotiation, and he set out for Madrid, where his treaty was soon\r\nconcluded, in the name of the Duke of Orleans.  The Spaniards were to\r\nfurnish twelve thousand foot and five thousand horse, four hundred\r\nthousand crowns down, twelve thousand crowns’ pay a month, and three\r\nhundred thousand livres to fortify the frontier-town which was promised\r\nby the duke.  Sedan, Cinq-Mars, and the Duke of Bouillon were only\r\nmentioned in a separate instrument.\r\n\r\nThe king was then at Narbonne, on his way to his army, which was\r\nbesieging Perpignan.  The grand equerry was with him.  Fontrailles went\r\nto call upon him.  “I do not intend to be seen by anybody,” said he, “but\r\nto make speedily for England, as I do not think I am strong enough to\r\nundergo the torture the cardinal might put me to in his own room on the\r\nleast suspicion.”  On the 21st of April, the cardinal was dangerously\r\nill, and the king left him at Narbonne a prey to violent fever, with an\r\nabscess on the arm which prevented him from writing, whilst Cinq-Mars,\r\never present and ever at work, was doing his best to insinuate into his\r\nmaster’s mind suspicion of the minister, and the hopes founded upon his\r\ndisgrace or death.  The king listened, as he subsequently avowed, in\r\norder to discover his favorite’s wicked thoughts and make him tell all he\r\nhad in his heart.  “The king was tacitly the head of this conspiracy,”\r\n says Madame de Motteville: “the grand equerry was the soul of it; the\r\nname made use of was that of the Duke of Orleans, the king’s only\r\nbrother; and their counsel was the Duke of Bouillon, who joined with them\r\nbecause, having belonged to the party of M. de Soissons, he was in very\r\nill odor at court.  They all formed fine projects touching the change\r\nthat was to take place to the advantage of their aggrandizement and\r\nfortunes, persuading themselves that the cardinal could not live above a\r\nfew days, during which he would not be able to set himself right with the\r\nking.”  Such were their projects and their hopes when the Gazette de\r\nFrance, on the 21st of June, 1642, gave these two pieces of news both\r\ntogether.  “The cardinal-duke, after remaining two days at Arles,\r\nembarked on the 11th of this month for Tarascon, his health becoming\r\nbetter and better.  The king has ordered under arrest Marquis de Cinq-\r\nMars, grand equerry of France.”\r\n\r\nGreat was the surprise, and still greater was the dismay, amongst the\r\nfriends of Cinq-Mars.  “Your grand designs are as well known at Paris as\r\nthat the Seine flows under the Pont Neuf,” wrote Mary di Gonzaga to him a\r\nfew days previously.\r\n\r\nThose grand designs so imprudently divulged caused a presentiment of\r\ngreat peril.  When left alone with his young favorite, and suddenly\r\noverwhelmed, amidst his army, with cares and business of which his\r\nminister usually relieved him, the king had too much wit not to perceive\r\nthe frivolous insignificance of Cinq-Mars compared with the mighty\r\ncapability of the cardinal.  “I love you more than ever,” he wrote to\r\nRichelieu: “we have been too long together to be ever separated, as I\r\nwish everybody to understand.  In reply, the cardinal had sent him a copy\r\nof the treaty between Cinq-Mars and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe king could not believe his eyes; and his wrath equalled his\r\nastonishment.  Together with that of the grand equerry he ordered the\r\nimmediate arrest of M. de Thou, his intimate friend; and the order went\r\nout to secure the Duke of Bouillon, then at the head of the army of\r\nItaly.  He, caught, like Marshal Marillac, in the midst of his troops,\r\nhad vainly attempted to conceal himself; but he was taken and conducted\r\nto the castle of Pignerol.  Fontrailles had seen the blow coming.  He\r\nwent to visit the grand equerry, and, “Sir,” said he, “you are a fine\r\nfigure; if you were shorter by the whole head, you would not cease to be\r\nvery tall; as for me, who am already very short, nothing could be taken\r\noff me without inconveniencing me and making me cut the poorest figure in\r\nthe world; you will be good enough, if you please, to let me get out of\r\nthe way of edged tools.”  And he set out for Spain, whence he had hardly\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of the most guilty, if not the most dangerous, of all the\r\naccomplices?  Monsieur, “the king’s only (unique) brother,” as Madame de\r\nMotteville calls him, had come as far as Moulins, and had sent to ask the\r\ngrand equerry to appoint a place of meeting, when he heard of his\r\naccomplice’s arrest, and, before long, that of the Duke of Bouillon.\r\nFrightened to death as he was, he saw that treachery was safer than\r\nflight, and, just as the king had joined the all but dying cardinal at\r\nTarascon, there arrived an emissary from the Duke of Orleans bringing\r\nletters from him.  He assured the king of his fidelity; he entreated\r\nChavigny, the minister’s confidant, to give him “means of seeing his\r\nEminence before he saw the king, in which case all would go well.”  He\r\nappealed to the cardinal’s generosity, begging him to keep his letter as\r\nan eternal reproach, if he were not thenceforth the most faithful and\r\ndevoted of his friends.\r\n\r\nAbbe de La Riviere, who was charged to implore pardon for his master,\r\nwas worthy of such a commission: he confessed everything, he signed\r\neverything, though he “all but died of terror,” and, at the cardinal’s\r\ndemand, he soon brought all those poltrooneries written out in the Duke\r\nof Orleans’ own hand.  The prince was all but obliged to appear at the\r\ntrial and deliver up his accomplices in the face of the whole world.\r\nThe respect, however, of Chancellor Seguier for his rank spared him this\r\ncrowning disgrace.  The king’s orders to his brother, after being\r\nsubmitted to the cardinal, bore this note in the minister’s hand:\r\n“Monsieur will have in his place of exile twelve thousand crowns a month,\r\nthe same sum that the King of Spain had promised to give him.”\r\n\r\n“Paralysis of the arm did not prevent the head from acting;” the dying\r\ncardinal had dictated to the king, stretched on a couch at his side, in a\r\nchamber of his house at Monfrin, near Tarascon, those last commands which\r\ncompleted the dishonor of the Duke of Orleans and the ruin of the\r\nfavorite.  Louis XIII. slowly took the road back to Fontainebleau in the\r\ncardinal’s litter, which the latter had lent him.  The prisoners were\r\nleft in the minister’s keeping, who ordered them before long to Lyons,\r\nwhither he was himself removed.  The grand equerry coming from\r\nMontpellier, M. de Thou from Tarascon, in a boat towed by that of the\r\ncardinal, and the Duke of Bouillon from Pignerol, were all three lodged\r\nin the castle of Pierre-Encise.  Their examination was put off until the\r\narrival of such magistrates “as should be capable of philosophizing and\r\nperpetually thinking of the means they must use for arriving at their\r\nends.”  That was useless, inasmuch as the grand equerry “never ceased to\r\nsay quite openly that he had done nothing to which the king had not\r\nconsented.”\r\n\r\nLouis XIII. was, no doubt, affected by such language; for, scarcely had\r\nhe arrived at Fontainebleau, whither he had been preceded by news of the\r\nend of the queen his mother, who had died at Cologne in exile and\r\npoverty, when he wrote to all the parliaments of his kingdom, to the\r\ngovernors of the provinces, and to the ambassadors at foreign courts, to\r\ngive his own account of the arrest of the guilty and the part he himself\r\nhad played in the matter.  “The notable and visible change which had for\r\nthe last year appeared in the conduct of Sieur de Cinq-Mars, our grand\r\nequerry, made us resolve, as soon as we perceived it, to carefully keep\r\nwatch on his actions and his words, in order to fathom them and discover\r\nwhat could be the cause.  To this end, we resolved to let him act and\r\nspeak with us more freely than heretofore.”  And in a letter written\r\nstraight to the chancellor, the king exclaims in wrath, “It is true that\r\nhaving seen me sometimes dissatisfied with the cardinal, whether from the\r\napprehension I felt lest he should hinder me from going to the siege of\r\nPerpignan, or induce me to leave it, for fear lest my health might\r\nsuffer, or from any other like reason, the said Sieur de Cinq-Mars left\r\nnothing undone to chafe me against my said cousin, which I put up with so\r\nlong as his evil offices were confined within the bounds of moderation.\r\nBut when he went so far as to suggest to me that the cardinal must be got\r\nrid of, and offered to carry it out himself, I conceived a horror of his\r\nevil thoughts, and held them in detestation.  Although I have only to say\r\nso for you to believe it, there is nobody who can deem but that it must\r\nhave been so; for, otherwise, what motive would he have had for joining\r\nhimself to Spain against me, if I had approved of what he desired?”\r\n\r\nThe trial was a foregone conclusion; the king and his brother made common\r\ncause in order to overwhelm the accused, “an earnest of a peace which was\r\nnot such as God announced with good will to man on Christmas day,” writes\r\nMadame de Motteville, “but such as may exist at court and amongst\r\nbrothers of royal blood.”\r\n\r\nThe cardinal did not think it necessary to wait for the sentence.  He had\r\narrived at his house at Lyons, in a sort of square chamber, covered with\r\nred damask, and borne on the shoulders of eighteen guards; there,\r\nstretched upon his couch, a table covered with papers beside him, he\r\nworked and chatted with whomsoever of his servants he had been pleased to\r\nhave as his companion on the road.  It was in the same equipage that he\r\nleft Lyons to gain the Loire and return to Paris.  On his passage, it was\r\nnecessary to pull down lumps of wall and throw bridges over the fosses to\r\nmake way for this vast litter and the indomitable man that lay dying\r\nwithin it.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 12th of September, 1642, that the accused appeared before\r\nthe commission; there were now but two of them; the Duke of Bouillon had\r\nmade his private arrangement with the cardinal, confessing everything,\r\nand requesting “to have his life spared in order that he might employ it\r\nto preserve to the Catholic church five little children whom his death\r\nwould leave to persons of the opposite religion.”  In consideration of\r\nthis pardon, a demand was made upon him to give up Sedan to the king,\r\n“though it were easy to gain possession of-it by investment.”  The duke\r\nconsented to all, and he awaited in his dungeon at Pierre-Bncise the\r\nexecution of his accomplices who had no town to surrender.  Their death\r\nwas to be the signal of his liberation.\r\n\r\nThe two accused denied nothing.  M. de Thou merely maintained that he had\r\nnot been in any way mixed up with the conspiracy, proving that he had\r\nblamed the treaty with Spain, and that his only crime was not having\r\nrevealed it.  “He believed me to be his friend, his one faithful friend,”\r\n said he, speaking of Cinq-Mars, “and I had no mind to betray him.”  The\r\ngrand equerry told in detail the story of the plot, his connection with\r\nthe Duke of Orleans, who had missed no opportunity of paying court to\r\nhim, the resolutions taken in concert with the Duke of Bouillon, and the\r\ntreaty concluded with Spain, “confessing that he had erred, and had no\r\nhope but in the clemency of the king, and of the cardinal, whose\r\ngenerosity would be so much the more shown in asking pardon for him as he\r\nwas the less bound to do so.”  There was not long to wait for the decree;\r\nthe votes were unanimous against the grand equerry, a single one of the\r\njudges pronouncing in favor of M. de Thou.  The latter turned towards\r\nCinq-Mars, and said, “Ah! well, sir; humanly speaking, I might complain\r\nof you; you have placed me in the dock, and you are the cause of my\r\ndeath; but God knows how I love you.  Let us die, sir, let us die\r\ncourageously, and win Paradise.”\r\n\r\nThe decree against Cinq-Mars sentenced him to undergo the question in\r\norder to get a more complete revelation of his accomplices.  “It had been\r\nresolved not to put him to it,” says Tallemant des Reaux: “but it was\r\nexhibited to him nevertheless; it gave him a turn, but it did not make\r\nhim do anything to belie himself, and he was just taking off his doublet,\r\nwhen he was told to raise his hand in sign of telling the truth.”\r\n\r\nThe execution was not destined to be long deferred; the very day on which\r\nthe sentence was delivered saw the execution of it.  “The grand equerry\r\nshowed a never-changing and very resolute firmness to the death, together\r\nwith admirable calmness and the constancy and devoutness of a Christian,”\r\n wrote M. du Marca, councillor of state, to the secretary of state\r\nBrionne; and Tallemant des Reaux adds, “He died with astoundingly great\r\ncourage, and did not waste time in speechifying; he would not have his\r\neyes bandaged, and kept them open when the blow was struck.”  M. de Thou\r\nsaid not a word save to God, repeating the Credo even to the very\r\nscaffold, with a fervor of devotion that touched all present.  “We have\r\nseen,” says a report of the time, “the favorite of the greatest and most\r\njust of kings lose his head upon the scaffold at the age of twenty-two,\r\nbut with a firmness which has scarcely its parallel in our histories.  We\r\nhave seen a councillor of state die like a saint after a crime which men\r\ncannot justly pardon.  There is nobody in the world who, knowing of their\r\nconspiracy against the state, does not think them worthy of death, and\r\nthere will be few who, having knowledge of their rank and their fine\r\nnatural qualities, will not mourn their sad fate.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cinq-Mars and De Thou going to Execution----215]\r\n\r\n“Now that I make not a single step which does not lead me to death, I am\r\nmore capable than anybody else of estimating the value of the things of\r\nthe world,” wrote Cinq-Mars to his mother, the wife of Marshal d’Effiat.\r\n“Enough of this world; away to Paradise!” said M. de Thou, as he marched\r\nto the scaffold.  Chalais and Montmorency had used the same language.  At\r\nthe last hour, and at the bottom of their hearts, the frivolous courtier\r\nand the hare-brained conspirator, as well as the great soldier and the\r\ngrave magistrate, had recovered their faith in God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.----LOUIS XIII., CARDINAL RICHELIEU, AND THE PROVINCES.\r\n\r\nThe story has been told of the conspiracies at court and the repeated\r\nchecks suffered by the great lords in their attempts against Cardinal\r\nRichelieu.  With the exception of Languedoc, under the influence of its\r\ngovernor the Duke of Montmorency, the provinces took no part in these\r\nenterprises; their opposition was of another sort; and it is amongst the\r\nparliaments chiefly that we must look for it.\r\n\r\n“The king’s cabinet and his bed-time business (_petit coucher_) cause me\r\nmore embarrassment than the whole of Europe causes me,” said the cardinal\r\nin the days of the great storms at court; he would often have had less\r\ntrouble in managing the parliaments and the Parliament of Paris in\r\nparticular, if the latter had not felt itself supported by a party at\r\ncourt.  For a long time past a pretension had been put forward by that\r\ngreat body to give the king advice, and to replace towards him the\r\nvanished states-general.  “We hold the place in council of the princes\r\nand barons, who from time immemorial were near the person of the kings,”\r\n was the language used, in 1615, in the representations of the Parliament,\r\nwhich had dared, without the royal order, to summon the princes, dukes,\r\npeers, and officers of the crown to deliberate upon what was to be done\r\nfor the service of the king, the good of the state, and the relief of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThis pretension on the part of the parliaments was what Cardinal\r\nRichelieu was continually fighting against.  He would not allow the\r\nintervention of the magistrates in the government of the state.  When he\r\ntook the power into his hands, nine parliaments sat in France--Paris,\r\nToulouse, Grenoble, Bordeaux, Dijon, Rouen, Aix, Rennes, and Pau: he\r\ncreated but one, that of Metz, in 1633, to severe in a definitive manner\r\nthe bonds which still attached the three bishoprics to the Germanic\r\nempire.  Trials at that time were carried in the last resort to Spires.\r\n\r\nThroughout the history of France we find the Parliament of Paris bolder\r\nand more enterprising than all the rest: and it did not belie its\r\ncharacter in the very teeth of Richelieu.  When, after _Dupes’ Day_ was\r\nover, Louis XIII. declared all the companions of his brother’s escape\r\nguilty of high treason, the Parliament of Dijon, to which the decree was\r\npresented by the king himself, enregistered it without making any\r\ndifficulty.  All the other parliaments followed the example; that of\r\nParis alone resisted, and its decision on the 25th of April contained a\r\nbitter censure upon the cardinal’s administration.  On the 12th of May,\r\nthe decision of that Parliament was quashed by a decree of the royal\r\ncouncil, and all its members were summoned to the Louvre; on their knees\r\nthey had to hear the severe reprimand delivered by Chateauneuf, keeper of\r\nthe seals; and one president and three counsellors were at the same time\r\ndismissed.  When the Parliament, still indomitable, would have had those\r\nmagistrates sit in defiance of the royal order, they were not to be found\r\nin their houses; the soldiery had carried them off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Parliament of Paris reprimanded----217]\r\n\r\nThe trial of Marshal Marillac, before a commission, twice modified during\r\nthe course of proceedings, of the Parliament of Dijon, was the occasion\r\nof a fresh reclamation on the part of the Parliament of Paris; and the\r\nking’s ill-humor against the magistrates burst forth on the occasion of a\r\ncommission constituted at the Arsenal to take cognizance of the crime of\r\ncoining.  The Parliament made some formal objections the king, who was at\r\nthat time at Metz with his troops, summoned President Seguier and several\r\ncounsellors.  He quashed the decree of the Parliament.  “You are only\r\nconstituted,” said he, “to judge between Master Peter and Master John\r\n(between John Doe and Richard Roe); if you go on as at present, I will\r\npare your nails so close that you’ll be sorry for it.”  Five counsellors\r\nwere interdicted, and had great trouble in obtaining authority to sit\r\nagain. So many and such frequent squabbles, whether about points of\r\njurisdiction or about the registration of edicts respecting finances,\r\nwhich the Parliament claimed to have the right of looking into, caused\r\nbetween the king, inspired by his minister, and the Parliament of Paris\r\nan irritation which reached its height during the trial of the Duke of\r\nLa Valette, third son of the Duke of Epernon, accused, not without\r\ngrounds, of having caused the failure of the siege of Fontarabia from\r\n\r\njealousy towards the Prince of Conde.  The affair was called on before\r\na commission composed of dukes and peers, some councillors of state and\r\nsome members of the Parliament, which demanded that the duke should be\r\nremoved to its jurisdiction.  “I will not have it,” answered the king;\r\n“you are always making difficulties; it seems as if you wanted to keep me\r\nin leading-strings; but I am master, and shall know how to make myself\r\nobeyed: It is a gross error to suppose that I have not a right to bring\r\nto judgment whom I think proper and where I please.”  The king himself\r\nasked the judges for their opinion.  [_Isambert, Recueil des anciennes\r\nLois Francaises,_ t. xvi.]  “Sir,” replied Counsellor Pinon, dean of the\r\ngrand chamber, “for fifty years I have been in the Parliament, and I\r\nnever saw anything of this sort; M. de La Valette had the honor of\r\nwedding a natural sister of your Majesty, and he is, besides, a peer\r\nof France; I implore you to remove him to the jurisdiction of the\r\nParliament.”  “Your opinion!” said the king, curtly.  “I am of opinion\r\nthat the Duke of La Valette be removed to be tried before the\r\nParliament.”  “I will not have that; it is no opinion.”  “Sir, removal is\r\na legitimate opinion.”  “Your opinion on the case!” rejoined the king,\r\nwho was beginning to be angry; “if not, I know what I must do.”\r\n President Bellievre was even bolder.  “It is a strange thing,” said he to\r\nLouis XIII.’s face, to see a king giving his vote at the criminal trial\r\nof one of his subjects; hitherto kings have reserved to themselves the\r\nrights of grace, and have removed to their officers’ province the\r\nsentencing of culprits.  Could your Majesty bear to see in the dock a\r\nnobleman, who might leave your presence only for the scaffold?  It is\r\nincompatible with kingly majesty.”  “Your opinion on the case!” bade the\r\nking.  “Sir, I have no other opinion.”  The Duke of La Valette had taken\r\nrefuge in England: he was condemned and executed in effigy.  The\r\nattorney-general, Matthew Mold, “did not consider it his business to\r\ncarry out an execution of that sort: “and recourse was obliged to be had\r\nto the lieutenant-governor of convicts at the Chatelet of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe cup had overflowed, and the cardinal resolved to put an end to an\r\nopposition which was the more irritating inasmuch as it was sometimes\r\nlegitimate.  A notification of the king’s, published in 1641, prohibited\r\nthe Parliament from any interference in affairs of state and\r\nadministration.  The whole of Richelieu’s home-policy is summed up in the\r\npreamble to that instrument, a formal declaration of absolute power\r\nconcentrated in the hands of the king.  “It seemeth that, the institution\r\nof monarchies having its foundation in the government of a single one,\r\nthat rank is as it were the soul which animates them and inspires them\r\nwith as much force and vigor as they can have short of perfection.  But\r\nas this absolute authority raises states to the highest pinnacle of their\r\nglory, so, when it happens to be enfeebled, they are observed, in a short\r\ntime, to fall from their high estate.  There is no need to go out of\r\nFrance to find instances of truth.  .  .  .  The fatal disorders and\r\ndivisions of the League, which ought to be buried in eternal oblivion,\r\nowed their origin and growth to disregard of the kingly authority  Henry\r\nthe Great, in whom God had put the most excellent virtues of a great\r\nprince, on succeeding to the crown of Henry III., restored by his valor\r\nthe kingly authority which had been as it were cast down and trampled\r\nunder foot.  France recovered her pristine vigor, and let all Europe see\r\nthat power concentrated in the person of the sovereign is the source of\r\nthe glory and greatness of monarchies, and the foundation upon which\r\ntheir preservation rests.  .  .  .  We, then, have thought it necessary\r\nto regulate the administration of justice, and to make known to our\r\nparliaments what is the legitimate usage of the authority which the\r\nkings, our predecessors, and we have deposited with them, in order that a\r\nthing which was established for the good of the people may not produce\r\ncontrary effects, as would happen if the officers, instead of contenting\r\nthemselves with that power which makes them judges in matters of life and\r\ndeath and touching the fortunes of our subjects, would fain meddle in the\r\ngovernment of the state which appertains to the prince only.”\r\n\r\nThe cardinal had gained the victory.  Parliament bowed the head; its\r\nattempts at independence during the Fronde were but a flash, and the yoke\r\nof Louis XIV. became the more heavy for it.  The pretensions of the\r\nmagistrates were often foundationless, the restless and meddlesome\r\ncharacter of their assemblies did harm to their remonstrances; but for a\r\nlong while they maintained, in the teeth of more and more absolute kingly\r\npower, the country’s rights in the government, and they had perceived the\r\ndangers of that sovereign monarchy which certainly sometimes raises\r\nstates to the highest pinnacle of their glory, but only to let them sink\r\nbefore long to a condition of the most grievous abasement.\r\n\r\nThough always first in the breach, the Parliament of Paris was not alone\r\nin its opposition to the cardinal.  The Parliament of Dijon protested\r\nagainst the sentence of Marshal Marillac, and refused, to its shame, to\r\nbear its share of the expenses for the defence of Burgundy against the\r\nDuke of Lorraine, in 1636, a refusal which cost it the suspension of its\r\npremier president.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of Brittany, in defence of its jurisdictional privileges,\r\nrefused to enregister the decree which had for object the foundation of a\r\ncompany trading with the Indies, “for the general trade between the West\r\nand the East,” a grand idea of Richelieu’s, the seat of which was to be\r\nin the roads of Morbihan; the company, already formed, was disheartened,\r\nthanks to the delays caused by the Parliament, and the enterprise failed.\r\nThe Parliament of Grenoble, fearing a dearth of corn in Dauphiny, quashed\r\nthe treaties of supply for the army of Italy, at the time of the second\r\nexpedition to Mantua; it went so far as to have the dealers’ granaries\r\nthrown open, and the superintendent of finance, D’Emery, was obliged to\r\ncome to terms with the deputies of Dauphiny, “in order that they of the\r\nParliament of Grenoble, who said they had no interests but those of the\r\nprovince, might have no reason to prevent for the future the transport of\r\ncorn,” says Richelieu himself in his Memoires.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of Rouen had always passed for one of the most\r\nrecalcitrant.  The province of Normandy was rich, and, consequently,\r\noverwhelmed with imposts; and several times the Parliament refused to\r\nenregister financial edicts which still further aggravated the distress\r\nof the people.  In 1637 the king threatened to go in person to Rouen and\r\nbring the Parliament to submission, whereat it took fright and\r\nenregistered decrees for twenty-two millions.  It was, no doubt, this\r\naugmentation of imposts that brought about the revolt of the Nu-pieds\r\n(Barefoots) in 1639.  Before now, in 1624 and in 1637, in Perigord and\r\nRouergue, two popular risings of the same sort, under the name of\r\nCroquants (Paupers), had disquieted the authorities, and the governor of\r\nthe province had found some trouble in putting them down.  The Nu-pieds\r\nwere more numerous and more violent still; from Rouen to Avranches all\r\nthe country was a-blaze.  At Coutances and at Vire, several monopoliers\r\nand gabeleurs, as the fiscal officers were called, were massacred; a\r\ngreat number of houses were burned, and most of the receiving-offices\r\nwere pulled down or pillaged.  Everywhere the army of suffering (_armee\r\nde souffrance_), the name given by the revolters to themselves, made,\r\nappeal to violent passions; popular rhymes were circulated from hand to\r\nhand, in the name of General _Nu-pieds (Barefoot),_ an imaginary\r\npersonage whom nobody ever saw.  Some of these verses are fair enough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Barefoots----221]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO NORMANDY.\r\n\r\n               “Dear land of mine, thou canst no more\r\n               What boots it to have served so well?\r\n               For see! thy faithful service bore\r\n               This bitter fruit--the cursed gabelle.\r\n               Is that the guerdon earned by those\r\n               Who succored France against her foes,\r\n               Who saved her kings, upheld her crown,\r\n               And raised the lilies trodden down,\r\n               In spite of all the foe could do,\r\n               In spite of Spain and England too?\r\n\r\n               “Recall thy generous blood, and show\r\n               That all posterity may know--\r\n               Duke William’s breed still lives at need:\r\n               Show that thou hast a heavier hand\r\n               Than erst came forth from Northern land;\r\n               A hand so strong, a heart so high,\r\n               These tyrants all shall beaten cry,\r\n               ‘From Normans and the Norman race\r\n               Deliver us, O God of grace!’”\r\n\r\nThe tumult was more violent at Rouen than anywhere else, and the\r\nParliament energetically resisted the mob.  It had sent two counsellors\r\nas a deputation to Paris to inform the king about the state of affairs.\r\n“You may signify to the gentlemen of the Parliament of Rouen,” said\r\nChancellor Seguier, in answer to the delegates, “that I thank them for\r\nthe trouble they have taken on this occasion; I will let the king know\r\nhow they have behaved in this affair.  I beg them to go on as they have\r\nbegun.  I know that the Parliament did very good service there.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, several counsellors, on foot in the street and in the very midst\r\nof the revolters, had, at the peril of their lives, defended Le Tellier\r\nde Tourneville, receiver-general of gabels, and his officers, whilst the\r\nwhole Parliament, in their robes, with the premier president at their\r\nhead, perambulated Rouen, amidst the angry mob, repairing at once to the\r\npoints most threatened, insomuch that the presidents and counsellors were\r\n“in great danger and fear for their skins.”  [_Histoire du Parlement de\r\nNormandy,_ by M. Floquet, t. iv.]  It was this terror, born of tumults\r\nand the sight of an infuriated populace, which, at a later period,\r\nretarded the Parliament in dealing out justice, and brought down upon\r\nit the wrath of the king and of the cardinal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the insurrection was gaining ground, and the local authorities\r\nwere powerless to repress it.  There was hesitation at the king’s council\r\nin choosing between Marshal Rantzau and M. de Gassion to command the\r\nforces ordered to march into Normandy.  “That country yields no wine,”\r\n said the king “that will not do for Rantzau, or be good quarters for\r\nhim.”  And they sent Colonel Gnssion, not so heavy a drinker as Rantzau,\r\na good soldier and an inflexible character.  First at Caen, then at\r\nAvranches, where there was fighting to be done, at Coutances and at\r\nElbeuf, Gassion’s soldiery everywhere left the country behind them in\r\nsubjection, in ruin, and in despair.  They entered Rouen on the 31st of\r\nDecember, 1639, and on the 2d of January, 1640, the chancellor himself\r\narrived to do justice on the rebels heaped up in the prisons, whom the\r\nParliament dared not bring up for judgment.  “I come to Rouen,” he said,\r\non entering the town, “not to deliberate, but to declare and execute the\r\nmatters on which my mind is made up.”  And he forbade all intervention on\r\nthe part of the archbishop, Francis de Harlay, who was disposed, in\r\naccordance with his office of love as well as the parliamentary name he\r\nbore, to implore pity for the culprits, and to excuse the backward\r\njudges.  The chancellor did not give himself the trouble to draw up\r\nsentences. “The decree is at the tip of my staff,” replied Picot, captain\r\nof his guards, when he was asked to show his orders.  The executions were\r\nnumerous in Higher and Lower Normandy, and the Parliament received the\r\nwages of its tardiness.  All the members of the body, even the most aged\r\nand infirm, were obliged to leave Rouen.  A commission of fifteen\r\ncouncillors of the Parliament of Paris came to replace provisionally the\r\ninterdicted Parliament of Normandy; and, when the magistrates were\r\nempowered at last to resume their sitting, it was only a six months’\r\nterm: that is, the Parliament henceforth found itself divided into two\r\nfragments, perfect strangers one to the other, which were to sit\r\nalternately for six months.  “A veritable thunderbolt for that sovereign\r\ncourt, for by the six months’ term,” says M. Floquet, “there was no\r\nlonger any Parliament, properly speaking, but two phantoms of Parliament,\r\nmaking war on each other, whilst the government had the field open to\r\ncarve and cut without control.”\r\n\r\n“All obedience is now from fear,” wrote Grotius to Oxenstiern, chancellor\r\nof Sweden; “the idea is to exorcise and annihilate hatred by means of\r\nterror.”  “This year,” wrote an inhabitant of Rouen, “there have been no\r\nNew Year’s presents [_etrennes_], no singing of ‘the king’s drinking-song\r\n[_le roi boit_], in any house.  Little children will be able to tell\r\ntales of it when they have attained to man’s estate; for never, these\r\nfifty years past, so far as I can learn, has it been so.”  [_Journal de\r\nl’Abbe de la Rue_.]  The heaviest imposts weighed upon the whole\r\nprovince, which thus expiated the crime of an insignificant portion of\r\nits inhabitants.  “The king shall not lose the value of this handkerchief\r\nthat I hold,” said the superintendent Bullion, on arriving at Rouen.  And\r\nhe kept his word: Rouen alone had to pay more than three millions.  The\r\nprovince and its Parliament were henceforth reduced to submission.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the Parliaments that resisted the efforts of Cardinal\r\nRichelieu to concentrate all the power of the government in the hands of\r\nthe king.  From the time that the sovereigns had given up convoking the\r\nstates-general, the states-provincial had alone preserved the right of\r\nbringing to the foot of the throne the plaints and petitions of subjects.\r\nUnhappily few provinces enjoyed this privilege; Languedoc, Brittany,\r\nBurgundy, Provence, Dauphiny, and the countship of Pau alone were\r\nstates-districts, that is to say, allowed to tax themselves\r\nindependently and govern themselves to a certain extent.  Normandy,\r\nthough an elections-district, and, as such, subject to the royal agents\r\nin respect of finance, had states which continued to meet even in 1666.\r\nThe states-provincial were always convoked by the king, who fixed the\r\nplace and duration of assembly.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the states-provincial varied a great deal, according\r\nto the districts.  In Brittany all noblemen settled in the province had\r\nthe right of sitting, whilst the third estate were represented by only\r\nforty deputies.  In Languedoc, on the contrary, the nobility had but\r\ntwenty-three representatives, and the class of the third estate numbered\r\nsixty-eight deputies.  Hence, no doubt, the divergences of conduct to be\r\nremarked in those two provinces between the Parliament and the\r\nstates-provincial.  In Languedoc, even during Montmorency’s insurrection,\r\nthe Parliament remained faithful to the king and submissive to the\r\ncardinal, whilst the states declared in favor of the revolt: in Brittany,\r\nthe Parliament thwarted Richelieu’s efforts in favor of trade, which had\r\nbeen enthusiastically welcomed by the states.\r\n\r\nIn Languedoc as well as in Dauphiny the cardinal’s energy was constantly\r\ndirected towards reducing the privileges which put the imposts, and,\r\nconsequently, the royal revenues, at the discretion of the states.\r\nMontmorency’s insurrection cost Languedoc a great portion of its\r\nliberties, which had already been jeoparded, in 1629, on the occasion of\r\nthe Huguenots’ rising; and those of Dauphiny were completely lost; the\r\nstates were suppressed in 1628.\r\n\r\nThe states of Burgundy ordinarily assembled every three years, but they\r\nwere accustomed, on separating, to appoint “a chamber of states-general,”\r\n whereat the nobility, clergy, and third estate were represented, and\r\nwhich was charged to watch over the interests of the province in the\r\ninterval between the sessions. When, in 1629, Richelieu proposed to\r\ncreate, as in Languedoc, a body of “elect” to arrange with the fiscal\r\nagents for the rating of imposts without the concurrence of the states,\r\nthe assembly proclaimed that “it was all over with the liberties of the\r\nprovince if the edict passed,” and, in the chamber of the nobility, two\r\ngentlemen were observed to draw their swords.  But, spite of the\r\ndisturbance which took place at Dijon, in 1630, on occasion of an impost\r\non wines, and which was called, from the title of a popular ditty, _la\r\nSedition de Lanturlu,_ the province preserved its liberties, and remained\r\na states-district.\r\n\r\nIt was the same subject that excited in Provence the revolt of the\r\n_Cascaveous,_ or bell-bearers.  Whenever there was any question of\r\nelections or “elect,” the conspirators sounded their bells as a rallying\r\nsignal, and so numerous was the body of adherents that the bells were\r\nheard tinkling everywhere.  The Prince of Conde was obliged to march\r\nagainst the revolters, and the states assembled at Tarascon found\r\nthemselves forced to vote a subsidy of one million five hundred thousand\r\nlivres.  At this cost the privileges of Provence were respected.\r\n\r\nThe states of Brittany, on the contrary, lent the cardinal faithful\r\nsupport, when he repaired thither with the king, in 1626, at the time of\r\nthe conspiracy of Chalais; the Duke of Vendome, governor of Brittany, had\r\njust been arrested; the states requested the king “never to give them a\r\ngovernor issue of the old dukes, and to destroy the fortifications of the\r\ntowns and castles which were of no use for the defence of the country.”\r\n The petty noblemen, a majority in the states, thus delivered over the\r\nprovince to the kingly power, from jealousy of the great lords.  The\r\nordinance, dated from Nantes on the 31st of July, 1626, rendered the\r\nmeasure general throughout France.  The battlements of the castles fell\r\nbeneath the axe of the demolishers, and the masses of the district\r\nwelcomed enthusiastically the downfall of those old reminiscences of\r\nfeudal oppression.\r\n\r\nAs a sequel to the systematic humiliation of the great lords, even when\r\nprovincial governors, and to the gradual enfeeblement of provincial\r\ninstitutions, Richelieu had to create in all parts of France, still so\r\ndiverse in organization as well as in manners, representatives of the\r\nkingly power, of too modest and feeble a type to do without him, but\r\ncapable of applying his measures and making his wishes respected.  Before\r\nnow the kings of France had several times over perceived the necessity of\r\nkeeping up a supervision over the conduct of their officers in the\r\nprovinces.  The inquisitors (_enquesteurs_) of St.  Louis, the ridings of\r\nthe revising-masters (_chevauehees des maitres des requetes_), the\r\ndepartmental commissioners (_commissaires departis_) of Charles IX., were\r\nso many temporary and travelling inspectors, whose duty it was to inform\r\nthe king of the state of affairs throughout the kingdom.  Richelieu\r\nsubstituted for these shifting commissions a fixed and regular\r\ninstitution, and in 1637 he established in all the provinces overseers of\r\njustice, police, and finance, who were chosen for the most part from\r\namongst the burgesses, and who before long concentrated in their hands\r\nthe whole administration, and maintained the struggle of the kingly power\r\nagainst the governors, the sovereign courts, and the states-provincial.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the overseers of provinces were instituted, the battle\r\nof pure monarchy was gained; Richelieu had no further need of allies, he\r\nwanted mere subjects; but at the beginning of his ministry he had felt\r\nthe need of throwing himself sometimes for support on the nation, and\r\nthis great foe of the states-general had twice convoked the Assembly of\r\nNotables.  The first took place at Fontainebleau, in 1625-6.  The\r\ncardinal was at that time at loggerheads with the court of Rome: “If the\r\nMost Christian King,” said he, “is bound to watch over the interests of\r\nthe Catholic church, he has first of all to maintain his own reputation\r\nin the world.  What use would it be for a state to have power, riches,\r\nand popular government, if it had not character enough to bring other\r\npeople to form alliance with it?”  These few words summed up the great\r\nminister’s foreign policy, to protect the Catholic church whilst keeping\r\nup Protestant alliances.  The Notables understood the wisdom of this\r\nconduct, and Richelieu received their adhesion. It was just the same the\r\nfollowing year, the day after the conspiracy of Chalais; the cardinal\r\nconvoked the Assembly of Notables.  “We do protest before the living\r\nGod,” said the letters of convocation, “that we have no other aim and\r\nintention but His honor and the welfare of our subjects; that is why we\r\ndo conjure in His name those whom we convoke, and do most expressly\r\ncommand them, without fear or desire of displeasing or pleasing any, to\r\ngive us, in all frankness and sincerity, the counsels they shall judge on\r\ntheir consciences to be the most salutary and convenient for the welfare\r\nof the commonwealth.”  The assembly so solemnly convoked opened its\r\nsittings at the palace of the Tuileries on the 2d of December, 1626.  The\r\nstate of the finances was what chiefly occupied those present; and the\r\ncardinal himself pointed out the general principles of the reform he\r\ncalculated upon establishing.  “It is impossible,” he said, “to meddle\r\nwith the expenses necessary for the preservation of the state; it were a\r\ncrime to think of such a thing.  The retrenchment, therefore, must be in\r\nthe case of useless expenses.  The most stringent rules are and appear to\r\nbe, even to the most ill-regulated minds, comparatively mild, when they\r\nhave, in deed as well as in appearance, no object but the public good and\r\nthe safety of the state.  To restore the state to its pristine splendor,\r\nwe need not many ordinances, but a great deal of practical performance.”\r\n\r\nThe performance appertained to Richelieu, and he readily dispensed with\r\nmany ordinances.  The Assembly was favorable to his measures; but amongst\r\nthose that it rejected was the proposal to substitute loss of offices and\r\nconfiscation for the penalty of death in matters of rebellion and\r\nconspiracy.  “Better a moderate but certain penalty,” said the cardinal,\r\n“than a punishment too severe to be always inflicted.”  It was the\r\nnotables who preserved in the hands of the inflexible minister the\r\nterrible weapon of which he availed himself so often.  The Assembly\r\nseparated on the 24th of February, 1627, the last that was convoked\r\nbefore the revolution of 1789.  It was in answer to its demands, as well\r\nas to those of the states of 1614, that the keeper of the seals, Michael\r\nMarillac, drew up, in 1629, the important administrative ordinance which\r\nhas preserved from its author’s name the title of _Code Michau_.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal had propounded to the Notables a question which he had\r\ngreatly at heart--the foundation of a navy.  Already, when disposing,\r\nsome weeks previously, of the government of Brittany, which had been\r\ntaken away from the Duke of Vendome, he had separated from the office\r\nthat of admiral of Brittany; already he was in a position to purchase\r\nfrom M. de Montmorency his office of grand admiral of France, so as to\r\nsuppress it and substitute for it that of grand master of navigation,\r\nwhich was personally conferred upon Richelieu by an edict enregistered on\r\nthe 18th of March, 1627 .\r\n\r\n“Of the power which it has seemed agreeable to his Majesty that I should\r\nhold,” he wrote on the 20th of January, 1627, “I can say with truth, that\r\nit is so moderate that it could not be more so to be an appreciable\r\nservice, seeing that I have desired no wage or salary so as not to be a\r\ncharge to the state, and I can add without vanity that the proposal to\r\ntake no wage came from me, and that his Majesty made a difficulty about\r\nletting it be so.”\r\n\r\nThe Notables had thanked the king, for the intention he had “of being\r\npleased to give the kingdom the treasures of the sea which nature had so\r\nliberally proffered it, for without [keeping] the sea one cannot profit\r\nby the sea nor maintain war.”  Harbors repaired and fortified, arsenals\r\nestablished at various points on the coast, organization of marine\r\nregiments, foundation of pilot-schools, in fact, the creation of a\r\npowerful marine which, in 1642, numbered sixty-three vessels and\r\ntwenty-two galleys, that left the roads of Barcelona after the\r\nrejoicings for the capture of Perpignan and arrived the same evening at\r\nToulon--such were the fruits of Richelieu’s administration of naval\r\naffairs. “Instead,” said the bailiff of Forbin, “of having a handful of\r\nrebels forcing us, as of late, to compose our naval forces of foreigners\r\nand implore succor from Spain, England, Malta, and Holland, we are at\r\npresent in a condition to do as much for them if they continue in\r\nalliance with us, or to beat them when they fall off from us.”\r\n\r\nSo much progress on every point, so many efforts in all directions,\r\neighty-five vessels afloat, a hundred regiments of infantry, and three\r\nhundred troops of cavalry, almost constantly on a war footing, naturally\r\nentailed enormous expenses and terrible burdens on the people.  It was\r\nRichelieu’s great fault to be more concerned about his object than\r\nscrupulous as to the means he employed for arriving at it.  His\r\nprinciples were as harsh as his conduct.  “Reason does not admit of\r\nexempting the people from all burdens,” said he, “because in such case,\r\non losing the mark of their subjection, they would also lose remembrance\r\nof their condition, and, if they were free from tribute, would think that\r\nthey were from obedience also.”  Cruel words those, and singularly\r\ndestitute of regard for Christian charity and human dignity, beside\r\nwhich, however, must be placed these: “If the subsidies imposed on the\r\npeople were not to be kept within moderate bounds, even when they were\r\nneeded for the service of the country, they would not cease to be\r\nunjust.”  The strong common sense of this great mind did not allow him to\r\ndepart for long from a certain hard equity.  Posterity has preserved the\r\nmemory of his equity less than of his hardness: men want sympathy more\r\nthan justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.----LOUIS XIII., CARDINAL RICHELIEU, THE CATHOLICS AND THE\r\nPROTESTANTS.\r\n\r\nCardinal Richelieu has often been accused of indifference towards the\r\nCatholic church; the ultramontanes called him the Huguenots’ cardinal; in\r\nso speaking there was either a mistake or a desire to mislead; Richelieu\r\nwas all his life profoundly and sincerely Catholic; not only did no doubt\r\nas to the fundamental doctrines of his church trouble his mind, but he\r\nalso gave his mind to her security and her aggrandizement.  He was a\r\nbeliever on conviction, without religious emotions and without the\r\nmystic’s zeal; he labored for Catholicism whilst securing for himself\r\nProtestant alliances, and if the independence of his mind caused him to\r\nfeel the necessity for a reformation, it was still in the church and by\r\nthe church that he would have had it accomplished.\r\n\r\nSpirits more fervent and minds more pious than Richelieu’s felt the same\r\nneed.  On emerging from the violent struggles of the religious wars, the\r\nCatholic church had not lost her faith, but she had neglected sweetness\r\nand light.  King Henry IV.’s conversion had secured to her the victory in\r\nFrance, but she was threatened with letting it escape from her hands by\r\nher own fault.  God raised up for her some great servents who preserved\r\nher from this danger.\r\n\r\nThe oratorical and political brilliancy of the Catholic church in the\r\nreign of Louis XIV. has caused men to forget the great religious movement\r\nin the reign of Louis XIII.  Learned and mystic in the hands of Cardinal\r\nBerulle, humane and charitable with St. Vincent de Paul, bold and saintly\r\nwith M. de Saint Cyran, the church underwent from all quarters quickening\r\ninfluences which roused her from her dangerous lethargy.\r\n\r\nThe effort was attempted at all points at once.  The priests had sunk\r\ninto an ignorance as perilous as their lukewarmness. Mid all the\r\ndiplomatic negotiations which he undertook in Richelieu’s name, and the\r\nintrigues he, with the queen-mother, often hatched against him, Cardinal\r\nBerulle founded the con gregation of the Oratory, designed to train up\r\nwell-informed and pious young priests with a capacity for devoting\r\nthemselves to the education of children as well as the edification of the\r\npeople.  “ It is a body,” said Bossizet, “ in which everybody obeys and\r\nnobody commands.”  No vow fettered the members of this celebrated\r\ncongregation, which gave to the world Malebranche and Massillon.  It was,\r\nagain, under the inspiration of Cardinal B6rulle, renowned for the pious\r\ndirection of souls, that the order of Carmelites, hitherto confined to\r\nSpain, was founded in France.  The convent in Rue St.  Jacques soon\r\nnumbered amongst its penitents women of the highest rank.\r\n\r\nThe labors of Mgr. de Berulle tended especially to the salvation of\r\nindividual souls; those of St. Vincent de Paul embraced a vaster field,\r\nand one offering more scope to Christian humanity.  Some time before, in\r\n1610, St. Francis de Sales had founded, under the direction of Madame de\r\nChantal, the order of Visitation, whose duty was the care of the sick and\r\npoor; he had left the direction of his new institution to M. Vincent, as\r\nwas at that time the appellation of the poor priest without birth and\r\nwithout fortune, who was one day to be celebrated throughout the world\r\nunder the name of St. Vincent de Paul.  This direction was not enough to\r\nsatisfy his zeal for charity; children and sick, the ignorant and the\r\nconvict, all those who suffered in body or spirit, seemed to summon\r\nM. Vincent to their aid; he founded in 1617, in a small parish of Bresse,\r\nthe charitable society of Servants of the poor, which became in 1633, at\r\nParis, under the direction of Madame Legras, niece of the keeper of the\r\nseals Marillac, the sisterhood off Servants of the sick poor, and the\r\ncradle of the Sisters of Charity.  “They shall not have, as a regular\r\nrule,” said St.  Vincent, “any monastery but the houses of the sick, any\r\nchapel but their parish-church, any cloister but the streets of the town\r\nand the rooms of the hospitals, any enclosure but obedience, any grating\r\nbut the fear of God, or any veil but the holiest and most perfect\r\nmodesty.”  Eighteen thousand daughters of St. Vincent de Paul, of whom\r\nfourteen thousand are French, still testify at this day to the\r\nfar-sighted wisdom of their founder; his regulations have endured\r\nlike his work and the necessities of the poor.\r\n\r\nIt was to the daughters of Charity that M. Vincent confided the work in\r\nconnection with foundlings, when his charitable impulses led him, in\r\n1638, to take up the cause of the poor little abandoned things who were\r\nperishing by heaps at that time in Paris.  Appealing for help, on their\r\naccount, to the women of the world, one evening when he was in want of\r\nmoney, he exclaimed at the house of the Duchess of Aiguillon, Cardinal\r\nRichelieu’s niece, “Come now, ladies; compassion and charity have made\r\nyou adopt these, little creatures as your own children; you have been\r\ntheir mothers according to grace, since their mothers according to nature\r\nhave abandoned them.  Consider, then, whether you too will abandon them;\r\ntheir life and their death are in your hands; it is time to pronounce\r\ntheir sentence, and know whether you will any longer have pity upon them.\r\nThey will live if you continue to take a charitable care of them; they\r\nwill die and perish infallibly if you abandon them.”  St. Vincent de Paul\r\nhad confidence in human nature, and everywhere on his path sprang up good\r\nworks in response to his appeals; the foundation of Mission-priests or\r\nLazarists, designed originally to spread about in the rural districts the\r\nknowledge of God, still testifies in the East, whither they carry at one\r\nand the same time the Gospel and the name of France, to that great\r\nawakening of Christian charity which signalized the reign of Louis XIII.\r\nThe same inspiration created the seminary of St. Sulpice, by means of\r\nM. Olier’s solicitude, the brethren of Christian Doctrine and the\r\nUrsulines, devoted to the education of childhood, and so many other\r\ncharitable or pious establishments, noble fruits of devoutness and\r\nChristian sacrifice.\r\n\r\nNowhere was this fructuating idea of the sacrifice, the immolation of man\r\nfor God and of the present in prospect of eternity, more rigorously\r\nunderstood and practised than amongst the disciples of John du Vergier de\r\nHauranne, Abbot of St. Cyran.  More bold in his conceptions than Cardinal\r\nBerulle and St. Vincent de Paul, of a nature more austere and at the same\r\ntime more ardent, he had early devoted himself to the study of theology.\r\nConnected in his youth with a Fleming, Jansen, known under the name of\r\nJansenius and afterwards created Bishop of Ypres, he adopted with fervor\r\nthe doctrines as to the grace of God which his friend had imbibed in the\r\nschool of St. Augustin, and employing in the direction of souls that\r\nzealous ardor which makes conquerors, he set himself to work to\r\nregenerate the church by penance, sanctity, and sacrifice; God supreme,\r\nreigning over hearts subdued, that was his ultimate object, and he\r\nmarched towards it without troubling himself about revolts and\r\nsufferings, certain that he would be triumphant with God and for Him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Abbot of St. Cyran----234]\r\n\r\nVictories gained over souls are from their very nature of a silent sort:\r\nbut M. de St. Cyran was not content with them.  He wrote also, and his\r\nbook “Petrus Aurelius,” published under the veil of the anonymous,\r\nexcited a great stir by its defence of the rights of the bishops against\r\nthe monks, and even against the pope.  The Gallican bishops welcomed at\r\nthat time with lively satisfaction, its eloquent pleadings in favor of\r\ntheir cause.  But, at a later period, the French clergy discovered in\r\nSt. Cyran’s book free-thinking concealed under dogmatic forms.  “In case\r\nof heresy any Christian may become judge,” said Petrus Aurelius.  Who,\r\nthen, should be commissioned to define heresy?  So M. de St. Cyran was\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\nHe had been already by an enemy more formidable than the assemblies of\r\nthe clergy of France.  Cardinal Richelieu, naturally attracted towards\r\ngreatness as he was at a later period towards the infant prodigy of the\r\nPascals, had been desirous of attaching St. Cyran to himself.\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he one day, as he led back the simple priest into the\r\nmidst of a throng of his courtiers, “here you see the most learned man in\r\nEurope.”  But the Abbot of St. Cyran would accept no yoke but God’s: he\r\nremained independent, and perhaps hostile, pursuing, without troubling\r\nhimself about the cardinal, the great task he had undertaken.  Having\r\nhad, for two years past, the spiritual direction of the convent of Port\r\nRoyal, he had found in Mother Angelica Arnauld, the superior and reformer\r\nof the monastery, in her sister, Mother Agnes, and in the nuns of their\r\norder, souls worthy of him and capable of tolerating his austere\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nBefore long he had seen forming, beside Port Royal and in the solitude of\r\nthe fields, a nucleus of penitents, emulous of the hermits of the desert.\r\nM. Le Maitre, Mother Angelica’s nephew, a celebrated advocate in the\r\nParliament of Paris, had quitted all “to have no speech but with God.”\r\n A howling (_rugissant_) penitent, he had drawn after him his brothers,\r\nMM. de Sacy and de Sericourt, and, ere long, young Lancelot, the learned\r\nauthor of Greek roots: all steeped in the rigors of penitential life, all\r\nblindly submissive to M. de St.  Cyran and his saintly requirements.  The\r\ndirector’s power over so many eminent minds became too great.  Richelieu\r\nhad comprehended better than the bishops the tendency of M. de St.\r\nCyran’s ideas and writings.  “He continued to publish many opinions, new\r\nand leading to dangerous conclusions,” says Father Joseph in his\r\n_Memoires,_” in such sort that the king, being advertised, commanded him\r\nto be kept a prisoner in the Bois de Vincennes.”  “That man is worse than\r\nsix armies,” said Cardinal Richelieu; “if Luther and, Calvin had been\r\nshut up when they began to dogmatize, states would have been spared a\r\ngreat deal of trouble.”\r\n\r\nThe consciences of men and the ardor of their souls are not so easily\r\nstifled by prison or exile.  The Abbot of St. Cyran, in spite of the\r\nentreaties of his powerful friends, remained at Vincennes up to the death\r\nof Cardinal Richelieu; the seclusionists of Port Royal were driven from\r\ntheir retreat and obliged to disperse; but neither the severities of\r\nRichelieu, nor, at a later period, those of Louis XIV., were the true\r\ncause of the ultimate powerlessness of Jansenism to bring about that\r\nprofound reformation of the church which had been the dream of the Abbot\r\nof St. Cyran.  He had wished to immolate sinful man to God, and he\r\nregarded sanctity as the complete sacrifice of human nature corrupt to\r\nits innermost core.  Human conscience could not accept this cruel yoke;\r\nits liberty revolted against so narrow a prison; and the Protestant\r\nreformation, with a doctrine as austere as that of M. de St. Cyran, but\r\nmore true and more simple in its practical application, offered strong\r\nminds the satisfaction of direct and personal relations between God and\r\nman; it saw the way to satisfy them without crushing them; and that is\r\nwhy the kingly power in France succeeded in stifling Jansenism without\r\nhaving ever been able to destroy the Protestant faith.\r\n\r\nCardinal Richelieu dreaded the doctrines of M. de St. Cyran, and still\r\nmore those of the reformation, which went directly to the emancipation of\r\nsouls; but he had the wit to resist ecclesiastical encroachments, and,\r\nfor all his being a cardinal, never did minister maintain more openly the\r\nindependence of the civil power.  “The king, in things temporal,\r\nrecognizes no sovereign save God.”  That had always been the theory of\r\nthe Gallican church.  “The church of France is in the kingdom, and not\r\nthe kingdom in the church,” said the jurisconsult Loyseau, thus\r\nsubjecting ecclesiastics to the common law of all citizens.\r\n\r\nThe French clergy did not understand it so; they had recourse to the\r\nliberties of the Gallican church in order to keep up a certain measure of\r\nindependence as regarded Rome, but they would not give up their ancient\r\nprivileges, and especially the right of taking an independent share in\r\nthe public necessities without being taxed as a matter of law and\r\nobligation.  Here it was that Cardinal Richelieu withstood them: he\r\nmaintained that, the ecclesiastics and the brotherhoods not having the\r\nright to hold property in France by mortmain, the king tolerated their\r\npossession, of his grace, but he exacted the payment of seignorial dues.\r\nThe clergy at that time possessed more than a quarter of the property in\r\nFrance; the tax to be paid amounted, it is said, to eighty millions.  The\r\nsubsidies further demanded reached a total of eight millions six hundred\r\nlivres.\r\n\r\nThe clergy in dismay wished to convoke an assembly to determine their\r\nconduct; and after a great deal of difficulty it was authorized by the\r\ncardinal.  Before long he intimated to the five prelates who were most\r\nhostile to him that they must quit the assembly and retire to their\r\ndioceses.  “There are,” said the Bishop of Autun, who was entirely\r\ndevoted to Richelieu, “some who show great delicacy about agreeing to all\r\nthat the king demands, as if they had a doubt whether all the property of\r\nthe church belonged to him or not, and whether his Majesty, leaving the\r\necclesiastics wherewithal to provide for their subsistence and a moderate\r\nestablishment, could not take all the surplus.”  That sort of doctrine\r\nwould never do for the clergy; still they consented to pay five millions\r\nand a half, the sum to which the minister lowered his pretensions.  “The\r\nwants of the state,” said Richelieu, “are real; those of the church are\r\nfanciful and arbitrary; if the king’s armies had not repulsed the enemy,\r\nthe clergy would have suffered far more.”\r\n\r\nWhilst the cardinal imposed upon the French clergy the obligations common\r\nto all subjects, he defended the kingly power and majesty against the\r\nUltramoutanes, and especially against the Jesuits.  Several of their\r\npamphlets had already been censured by his order when Father Sanctarel\r\npublished a treatise on heresy and schism, clothed with the pope’s\r\napprobation, and containing, amongst other dangerous propositions, the\r\nfollowing: “The pope can depose emperor and kings for their iniquities or\r\nfor personal incompetence, seeing that he has a sovereign, supreme, and\r\nabsolute power.”  The work was referred to the Parliament, who ordered it\r\nto be burned in Place de Greve; there was talk of nothing less than the\r\nbanishment of the entire order.\r\n\r\nFather Cotton, superior of the French Jesuits, was summoned to appear\r\nbefore the council; he gave up Father Sanctarel unreservedly, making what\r\nexcuse he best could for the approbation of the pope and of the general\r\nof the Jesuits.  The condemnation of the work was demanded, and it was\r\nsigned by sixteen French fathers.  The Parliament was disposed to push\r\nthe matter farther, when Richelieu, always as prudent as he was firm in\r\nhis relations with this celebrated order, represented to the king that\r\nthere are “certain abuses which are more easily put down by passing them\r\nover than by resolving to destroy them openly, and that it was time to\r\ntake care lest proceedings should be carried to a point which might be as\r\nprejudicial to his service as past action had been serviceable to it.”\r\n The Jesuits remained in France, and their college at Clermont was not\r\nclosed; but they published no more pamphlets against the cardinal.  They\r\neven defended him at need.\r\n\r\nRichelieu’s grand quarrel with the clergy was nearing its end when the\r\nclimax was reached of a disagreement with the court of Rome, dating from\r\nsome time back.  The pope had never forgiven the cardinal for not having\r\naccepted his mediation in the affair with Spain on the subject of the\r\nValteline; he would not accede to the desire which Richelieu manifested\r\nto become legate of the Holy See in France, as Cardinal d’Amboise had\r\nbeen; and when Marshal d’Estrees arrived as ambassador at Rome, his\r\nresolute behavior brought the misunderstanding to a head: the pope\r\nrefused the customary funeral honors to Cardinal La Valette, who had died\r\nin battle, without dispensation, at the head of the king’s army in\r\nPiedmont.  Richelieu preserved appearances no longer; the king refused\r\nto receive the pope’s nuncio, and prohibited the bishops from any\r\ncommunication with him.  The quarrel was envenomed by a pamphlet called\r\n_Optatus Gallus_.  The cardinal’s enemies represented him as a new Luther\r\nready to excite a schism and found a patriarchate in France.  Father\r\nRabardeau, of the Jesuits’ order, maintained, in reply, that the act\r\nwould not be schismatical, and that the consent of Rome would be no more\r\nnecessary to create a patriarchate in France than it had been to\r\nestablish those of Constantinople and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nUrban VIII. took fright; he sent to France Julius Mazarin, at that time\r\nvice-legate, and already frequently employed in the negotiations between\r\nthe court of Rome and Cardinal Richelieu, who had taken a great fancy to\r\nhim.  The French clergy had just obtained authority to vote the subsidy\r\nin an assembly; and the pope contented himself with this feeble\r\nconcession.  Mazarin put the finishing touch to the reconciliation, and\r\nreceived as recompense the cardinal’s hat.  In fact, the victory of the\r\ncivil power was complete, and the independence of the crown clearly\r\nestablished.  “His Holiness,” said the cardinal, “ought to commend the\r\nzeal shown by his Majesty for the welfare of the church, and to remain\r\nsatisfied with the respect shown him by an appeal to his authority which\r\nhis Majesty might have dispensed with in this matter, having his\r\nParliaments to fall back upon for the chastisement of those who lived\r\nevilly in his kingdom.”  In principle, the supreme question between the\r\ncourt of Rome and the kingly power remained undecided, and it showed\r\nwisdom on the part of Urban VIII., as well as of Cardinal Richelieu,\r\nnever to fix fundamentally and within their exact limits the rights and\r\npretensions of the church or the crown.\r\n\r\nCardinal Richelieu had another battle to deliver, and another victory,\r\nwhich was to be more decisive, to gain.  During his exile at Avignon, he\r\nhad written against the Reformers, violently attacking their doctrines\r\nand their precepts; he was, therefore, personally engaged in the\r\ntheological strife, and more hotly than has been made out; but he was\r\nabove everything a great politician, and the rebellion of the Reformers,\r\ntheir irregular political assemblies, their alliances with the foreigner,\r\noccupied him, far more than their ministers’ preaching.  It was state\r\nwithin state that the reformers were seeking to found, and that the\r\ncardinal wished to upset.  Seconded by the Prince of Conde, the king had\r\nput an end to the war which cost the life of the constable De Luynes, but\r\nthe peace concluded at Montpellier on the 19th of November, 1622, had\r\nalready received many a blow; pacific counsels amongst the Reformers were\r\nlittle by little dying out together with the old servants of Henry IV.;\r\nDu Plessis-Mornay had lately died (November 11, 1623) at his castle of\r\nForet-sur-Sevres, and the direction of the party fell entirely into the\r\nhands of the Duke of Rohan, a fiery temper and soured by misfortunes as\r\nwell as by continual efforts made on the part of his brother, the Duke of\r\nSoubise, more restless and less earnest than he.  Hostilities broke out\r\nafresh at the beginning of the year 1625.  The Reformers complained that,\r\ninstead of demolishing Fort Louis, which commanded La Rochelle, all haste\r\nwas being made to complete the ramparts they had hoped to see razed to\r\nthe ground: a small royal fleet mustered quietly at Le Blavet, and\r\nthreatened to close the sea against the Rochellese.  The peace of\r\nMontpellier had left the Protestants only two surety-places, Montauban\r\nand La Rochelle; and they clung to them with desperation.  On the 6th of\r\nJanuary, 1625, Soubise suddenly entered the harbor of Le Blavet with\r\ntwelve vessels, and seizing without a blow the royal ships, towed them\r\noff in triumph to La Rochelle--a fatal success, which was to cost that\r\ntown dear.\r\n\r\nThe royal marine had hardly an existence; after the capture made by\r\nSoubise, help had to be requested from England and Holland; the marriage\r\nof Henrietta of France, daughter of Henry IV., with the Prince of Wales,\r\nwho was soon to become Charles I., was concluded; the English promised\r\neight ships; the treaties with the United Provinces obliged the\r\nHollanders to supply twenty, which they would gladly have refused to send\r\nagainst their brethren, if they could; the cardinal even required that\r\nthe ships should be commanded by French captains.  “One lubber may ruin a\r\nwhole fleet,” said he, “and a captain of a ship, if assured by the enemy\r\nof payment for his vessel, may undertake to burn the whole armament, and\r\nthat the more easily inasmuch as he would think he was making a grand\r\nsacrifice to God, for the sake of his religion.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Soubise had broken through the feeble obstacles opposed to\r\nhim by the Duke of Vendome, and, making himself master of all the\r\ntrading-vessels he encountered, soon took possession of the Islands of\r\nRe and Oleron and effected descents even into Medoc, whilst the Duke of\r\nRohan, leaving the duchess his wife, Sully’s daughter, at Castres, where\r\nhe had established the seat of his government, was scouring Lower\r\nLanguedoc and the Cevennes to rally his partisans.  The insurrection was\r\nvery undecided, and the movement very irregular.  Nimes, Uzes, and Alais\r\nclosed their gates; even Montauban hesitated a long while before\r\ndeclaring itself.  The Duke of Epernon ravaged the outskirts of that\r\nplace.  “At night,” writes his secretary, “might be seen a thousand\r\nfires.  Wheat, fruit trees, vines, and houses were the food that fed the\r\nflames.”  Marshal Themine did the same all round Castres, defended by\r\nthe Duchess of Rohan.\r\n\r\nThere were negotiations, nevertheless, already.  Rohan and Soubise\r\ndemanded to be employed against Spain in the Valteline, claiming the\r\ndestruction of Fort Louis; parleys mitigated hostilities; the Duke of\r\nSoubise obtained a suspension of arms from the Dutch Admiral Haustein,\r\nand then, profiting by a favorable gust of wind, approached the fleet,\r\nset fire to the admiral’s ship, and captured five vessels, which he towed\r\noff to the Island of Re.  But he paid dear for his treachery: the\r\nHollanders, in their fury, seconded with more zeal the efforts of the\r\nDuke of Montmorency, who had just taken the command of the squadron; the\r\nIsland of Re was retaken and Soubise obliged to retreat in a shallop to\r\nOleron, leaving for “pledge his sword and his hat, which dropped off in\r\nhis flight.”  Nor was the naval fight more advantageous for Soubise.\r\n“The battle was fierce, but the enemy had the worst,” says Richelieu in\r\nhis Memoires: “night coming on was favorable to their designs;\r\nnevertheless, they were so hotly pursued, that on the morrow, at\r\ndaybreak, eight of their vessels were taken.”  Soubise sailed away to\r\nEngland with the rest of his fleet, and the Island of Oleron surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe moment seemed to have come for crushing La Rochelle, deprived of the\r\nnaval forces that protected it; but the cardinal, still at grips with\r\nSpain in the Valteline, was not sure of his allies before La Rochelle.\r\nIn Holland all the churches echoed with reproaches hurled by the\r\npreachers against states that gave help against their own brethren to\r\nCatholics; at Amsterdam the mob had besieged the house of Admiral\r\nHaustein; and the Dutch fleet had to be recalled.  The English\r\nProtestants were not less zealous; the Duke of Soubise had been welcomed\r\nwith enthusiasm, and, though Charles I., now King of England and married,\r\nhad refused to admit the fugitive to his presence, he would not restore\r\nto Louis XIII. the vessels, captured from that king and his subjects,\r\nwhich Soubise had brought over to Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nThe game was not yet safe; and Richelieu did not allow himself to be led\r\nastray by the anger of fanatics who dubbed him State Cardinal.  “The\r\ncardinal alone, to whom God gave the blessedness of serving the king and\r\nrestoring to his kingdom its ancient lustre, and to his person the power\r\nand authority meet for royal Majesty which is the next Majesty after the\r\ndivine, saw in his mind the means of undoing all those tangles, clearing\r\naway all those mists, and emerging to the honor of his master from all\r\nthose confusions.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. iv.  p. 2.]\r\n\r\nMarshal Bassompierre was returning from his embassy to Switzerland,\r\nhaving secured the alliance of the Thirteen Cantons in the affair of the\r\nValteline, when it was noised abroad that peace with Spain was signed.\r\nCount du Fargis, it was said, had, in an excess of zeal, taken upon\r\nhimself to conclude without waiting for orders from Paris.  Bassompierre\r\nwas preparing a grand speech against this unexpected peace, but during\r\nthe night he reflected that the cardinal had perhaps been not so much\r\nastonished as he would have made out.  “I gave up my speech,” says he,\r\n“and betook myself to my jubilee.”\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots, on their side, yielded at the entreaties of the\r\nambassadors who had been sent by the English to France, “with orders to\r\nbeg the Rochellese to accept the peace which the king had offered them,\r\nand who omitted neither arguments nor threats in order to arrive at that\r\nconclusion; whence it came to pass that, by a course of conduct full of\r\nunwonted dexterity, the Huguenots were brought to consent to peace for\r\nfear of that with Spain, and the Spaniards to make peace for fear of that\r\nwith the Huguenots.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty the cardinal had to surmount was in the king’s\r\ncouncil; he was not ignorant that by getting peace made with the\r\nHuguenots, and showing him that he was somewhat inclined to favor their\r\ncause with the king, he might expose himself to the chance of getting\r\ninto bad odor at Rome.  But in no other way could he arrive at his\r\nMajesty’s ends.  His cloth made him suspected by the Huguenots; it was\r\nnecessary, therefore, to behave so that they should think him favorable\r\nto them, for by so doing he found means of waiting more conveniently for\r\nan opportunity of reducing them to the terms to which all subjects ought\r\nto be reduced in a state, that is to say, inability to form any separate\r\nbody, and liability to accept their sovereign’s wishes.\r\n\r\n“It was a grievous thing for him to bear, to see himself so unjustly\r\nsuspected at the court of Rome, and by those who affected the name of\r\nzealous Catholics; but he resolved to take patiently the rumors that were\r\ncurrent about him, apprehending that if he had determined to clear\r\nhimself of them effectually, he might not find that course of advantage\r\nto his master or the public.”\r\n\r\nThe cardinal, in fact, took it patiently, revising and then confirming\r\nthe treaty with Spain, and imposing on the Huguenots a peace so hard,\r\nthat they would never have accepted it but for the hope of obtaining at a\r\nlater period some assuagements, with the help of England, which refused\r\nformally to help them to carry on the war.  At the first parleys the king\r\nhad said, “I am disposed enough towards peace; I am willing to grant it\r\nto Languedoc and the other provinces.  As for La Rochelle, that is\r\nanother thing.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. iii.]  It was ultimately\r\nLa Rochelle that paid the expenses of the war, biding the time when the\r\nproud city, which had resisted eight kings in succession, would have to\r\nsuccumb before Louis XIII. and his all-powerful minister.  Already her\r\nindependence was threatened on all sides; the bastions and new\r\nfortifications had to be demolished; no armed vessel of war might be\r\nstationed in her harbor.  “The way was at last open,” said the cardinal,\r\n“to the extermination of the Huguenot party, which, for a hundred years\r\npast, had divided the kingdom.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. iii.\r\np. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Demolishing the Fortifications----244]\r\n\r\nThe peace of 1626, then, was but a preliminary to war.  Richelieu was\r\npreparing for it by land and sea; vessels of war were being built, troops\r\nwere being levied; and the temper of England furnished a pretext for\r\ncommencing the struggle.  King Charles I., at the instigation of his\r\nfavorite the Duke of Buckingham, had suddenly and unfeelingly dismissed\r\nthe French servants of the queen his wife, without giving her even time\r\nto say good by to them, insomuch that “the poor princess, hearing their\r\nvoices in the court-yard, dashed to the window, and, breaking the glass\r\nwith her head, clung with her hands to the bars to show herself to her\r\nwomen and take the last look at them.  The king indignantly dragged her\r\nback with so great an effort that he tore her hands right away.”  Louis\r\nXIII. had sent Marshal Bassompierre to England to complain of the insult\r\ndone to his sister; the Duke of Buckingham wished to go in person to\r\nFrance to arrange the difference, but the cardinal refused.  “Has\r\nBuckingham ever undertaken any foreign commission without going away\r\ndissatisfied and offended with the princes to whom he was sent?” said\r\nCardinal Richelieu to the king.  So the favorite of Charles I. resolved\r\nto go to France “in other style and with other attendants than he had as\r\nyet done; having determined to win back the good graces of the Parliament\r\nand the people of England by the succor he was about to carry to the\r\noppressed Protestant churches,” he pledged his property; he sold the\r\ntrading-vessels captured on the coasts of France; and on the 17th of\r\nJuly, 1627, he set sail with a hundred and twenty vessels, heading for La\r\nRochelle.  Soubise was on board his ship; and the Duke of Rohan, notified\r\nof the enterprise, had promised to declare himself the moment the English\r\nset foot in France.  Already he was preparing his manifesto to the\r\nchurches, avowing that he had summoned the English to his legitimate\r\ndefence, and that, since the king had but lately been justified in\r\nemploying the arms of the Hollanders to defeat them, much more reasonably\r\nmight he appeal to those of the English their brethren for protection\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nThis time the cardinal was ready; he had concluded an alliance with Spain\r\nagainst England, “declaring merely to the King of Spain that he was\r\nalready at open war with England, and that he would put in practice with\r\nall the power of his forces against his own states all sorts of\r\nhostilities permissible in honorable warfare, which his Majesty also\r\npromised to do by the month of June, 1628, at the latest.”  The king set\r\nout to go and take in person the command of the army intended to give the\r\nEnglish their reception.  He had gone out ill from the Parliament, where\r\nhe had been to have some edicts enregistered.  “I did nothing but tremble\r\nall the time I was holding my bed of justice,” he said to Bassompierre.\r\n“It is there, however, that you make others tremble,” replied the\r\nmarshal.  Louis XIII. was obliged to halt at Villeroy, where the cardinal\r\nremained with him, “being all day at his side, and most frequently not\r\nleaving him at night; he, nevertheless, had his mind constantly occupied\r\nwith giving orders, taking care above everything to let it appear before\r\nthe king that he had no fear; he preferred to put himself in peril of\r\nbeing blamed or ruined in well-doing, rather than, in order to secure\r\nhimself, to do anything which might be a cause of illness to his\r\nMajesty.”  In point of fact, Richelieu was not without anxiety, for Sieur\r\nde Toiras, a young favorite of the king’s, to whom he had entrusted the\r\ncommand in the Island of Re, had not provided for the defence of that\r\nplace so well as had been expected; Buckingham had succeeded in effecting\r\nhis descent.  The French were shut up in the Fort of St. Martin, scarcely\r\nfinished as it was, and ill-provisioned.  The cardinal “saw to it\r\ndirectly, sending of his own money because that of the king was not to be\r\nso quickly got at, and because he had at that time none to spare; he\r\ndespatched Abbe Marcillac, who was in his confidence, to see that\r\neverything was done punctually and no opportunity lost.  He did not\r\ntrouble himself to make reports of all the despatches that passed, and\r\nall the orders that were within less than a fortnight given on the\r\nsubject of this business during the king’s illness, in order to provide\r\nfor everything that was necessary, and to prepare all things in such wise\r\nthat the king and France might reap from them the fruit which was shortly\r\nafterwards gathered in.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile La Rochelle had closed her gates to the English, and the old\r\nDuchess of Rohan had been obliged to leave the town in order to bring\r\nSoubise in with her.  “Before taking any resolution,” replied the\r\nRochellese authorities to the entreaties of the duke, who was pressing\r\nthem to lend assistance to the English, “we must consult the whole body\r\nof the religion of which La Rochelle is only one member.”  An assembly\r\nwas already convoked to that end at Uzes; and when it met, on the 11th of\r\nSeptember, the Duke of Rohan communicated to the deputies from the\r\nchurches the letter of the inhabitants of La Rochelle, “not such an one,”\r\n he said, “as he could have desired, but such as he must make the best\r\nof.”  The King of England had granted his aid and promised not to relax\r\nuntil the Reformers had firm repose and solid contentment, provided that\r\nthey seconded his efforts.  “I bid you thereto in God’s name,” he added,\r\n“and for my part, were I alone, abandoned of all, I am determined to\r\nprosecute this sacred cause even to the last drop of my blood and to the\r\nlast gasp of my life.”  The assembly fully approved of their chief’s\r\nbehavior, accepting “with gratitude the King of England’s powerful\r\nintervention, without, however, loosing themselves from the humble and\r\ninviolable submission which they owed to their king.”  The consuls of the\r\ntown of Milhau were bolder in their reservations.  “We have at divers\r\ntime experienced,” they wrote to the Duke of Rohan, whilst refusing to\r\njoin the movement, “that violence is no certain means of obtaining\r\nobservation of our edicts, for force extorts many promises, but the\r\nhatred it engenders prevents them from taking effect.”  The duke was\r\nobliged to force an entrance into this small place.  La Rochelle had just\r\nrenounced her neutrality and taken sides with the English, “flattering\r\nourselves,” they said in their proclamation, “that, having good men for\r\nour witnesses and God for our judge, we shall experience the same\r\nassistance from His goodness as our fathers had aforetime.”\r\n\r\nM. de La Milliere, the agent of the Rochellese, wrote to one of his\r\nfriends at the Duke of Rohan’s quarters, “Sir, I am arrived from\r\nVilleroy, where the English are not held as they are at Paris to be a\r\nmere chimera.  Only I am very apprehensive of the September tides, and\r\nlest the new grapes should kill us off more English than the enemy will.\r\nI am much vexed to hear nothing from your quarter to second the exploits\r\nof the English, being unable to see without shame foreigners showing more\r\ncare for our welfare than we ourselves show.  I know that it will not be\r\nM. de Rohan’s fault nor yours that nothing good is done.\r\n\r\n“I forgot to tell you that the cardinal is very glad that he is no longer\r\na bishop, for he has put so many rings in pawn to send munitions to the\r\nislands, that he has nothing remaining wherewith to give the episcopal\r\nbenediction.  The most zealous amongst us pray God that the sea may\r\nswallow up his person as it has swallowed his goods.  As for me, I am not\r\nof that number, for I belong to those who offer incense to the powers\r\nthat be.”  It was as yet a time when the religious fatherland was dearer\r\nthan the political; the French Huguenots naturally appealed for aid to\r\nall Protestant nations.  It was even now an advance in national ideas to\r\ncall the English who had come to the aid of La Rochelle foreigners.\r\n\r\nToiras, meanwhile, still held out in the Fort of St. Martin, and\r\nBuckingham was beginning to “abate somewhat of the absolute confidence he\r\nhad felt about making himself master of it, having been so ill-advised as\r\nto write to the king his master that he would answer for it.”  The proof\r\nof this was that a burgess of La Rochelle, named Laleu, went to see the\r\nking with authority from the Duke of Angouleme, who commanded the army in\r\nhis Majesty’s absence, and that “he proposed that the English should\r\nretire, provided that the king would have Fort Louis dismantled.  The\r\nDuke of Angouleme was inclined to accept this proposal, but the cardinal\r\nforcibly represented all the reasons against it: “It will be said,\r\nperhaps, that if the Island of Re be lost, it will be very difficult to\r\nrecover it;” this he allowed, but he put forward, to counterbalance this\r\nconsideration, another, that, if honor were lost, it would never be\r\nrecovered, and that, if the Island of Re were lost, he considered that\r\nhis Majesty was bound to stick to the blockade of Rochelle, and that he\r\nmight do so with success.  Upon this, his Majesty resolved to push the\r\nsiege of Rochelle vigorously, and to give the command to Mylord his\r\nbrother; “but Monsieur was tardy as usual, not wanting to serve under the\r\nking when the health of his Majesty might permit him to return to his\r\narmy, so that the cardinal wrote to President Le Coigneux, one of the\r\nfavorite counsellors of the Duke of Orleans, to say that if imaginary\r\nhydras of that sort were often taking shape in the mind of Monsieur, he\r\nhad nothing more to say than that there would be neither pleasure nor\r\nprofit in being mixed up with his affairs.  As for himself, he would\r\nalways do his duty.”  Monsieur at last made up his mind to join the army,\r\nand it was resolved to give aid to the forts in the Island of Re.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Harbor of La Rochelle---248]\r\n\r\nIt was a bold enterprise that was about to be attempted to hold La\r\nRochelle invested and not quit it, and, nevertheless, to send the flower\r\nof the force to succor a citadel considered to be half lost; to make a\r\ndescent upon an island blockaded by a large naval armament; to expose the\r\nbest part of the army to the mercy of the winds and the waves of the sea,\r\nand of the English cannons and vessels, in a place where there was no\r\nlanding in order and under arms.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. iii.\r\np. 361]; but it had to be resolved upon or the Island of Re lost.  Toiras\r\nhad already sent to ask the Duke of Buckingham if he would receive him to\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of October, at eight A.  M., the Duke of Buckingham was\r\npreparing to send a reply to the fort, and he was already rejoicing “to\r\nsee his felicity and the crowning of his labors,” when, on nearing the\r\ncitadel, “there were exhibited to him at the ends of pikes lots of\r\nbottles of wine, capons, turkeys, hams, ox-tongues, and other provisions,\r\nand his vessels were saluted with lots of cannonades, they having come\r\ntoo near in the belief that those inside had no more powder.”  During the\r\nnight, the fleet which was assembled at Oleron, and had been at sea for\r\ntwo days past, had succeeded in landing close to the fort, bringing up\r\nre-enforcements of troops, provisions, and munitions.  At the same time\r\nthe king and the cardinal had just arrived at the camp before La\r\nRochelle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The King and Richelieu at La Rochelle----250]\r\n\r\nBefore long the English could not harbor a doubt but that the king’s army\r\nhad recovered its real heads: a grand expedition was preparing to attack\r\nthem in the Island of Re, and the cardinal had gone in person to Oleron\r\nand to Le Brouage in order to see to the embarkation of the troops.  “The\r\nnobility of the court came up in crowds to take leave of his Majesty, and\r\ntheir looks were so gay that it must be allowed that to no nation but the\r\nFrench is it given to march so freely to death for the service of their\r\nking or for their own honor as to make it impossible to remark any\r\ndifference between him that inflicts it and him that receives.”\r\n [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. iii.  p. 398.] Marshal Schomberg took the\r\nroad to Marennes, whence he sent to the cardinal for boats to carry over\r\nall his troops.  “This took him greatly by surprise, and as his judgments\r\nare always followed by the effect he intended, he thought that this great\r\nfollowing of nobility might hinder the said sir marshal from executing\r\nhis design so promptly.  However, by showing admirable diligence,\r\ndoubling both his vessels and his provisions, he found sufficient to\r\nembark the whole.”  [_Siege de La Rochelle.  Archives curieuses de\r\nl’Histoire de France,_ t. iii.  p. 76.]  By this time the king’s troops,\r\nin considerable numbers, had arrived in the island without the English\r\nbeing able to prevent their disembarkation; the enemy therefore took the\r\nresolution of setting sail, in spite of the entreaties which the Duke of\r\nSoubise sent them on the part of the Rochellese, those latter promising\r\ngreat assistance in men and provisions, more than they could afford.  To\r\nsatisfy them, the Duke of Buckingham determined to deliver a general\r\nassault before he departed.\r\n\r\nThe assault was delivered on the 5th and 6th of November, and everywhere\r\nrepulsed, exhausted as the besieged were.  “Those who were sick and laid\r\nup in their huts appeared on the bastions.  There were some of them so\r\nweak that, unable to fight, they loaded their comrades’ muskets; and\r\nothers, having fought beyond their strength, being able to do no more,\r\nsaid to their comrades, ‘Friend, here are my arms for thee; prithee, make\r\nmy grave;’ and, thither retiring, there they died.”  The Duke of\r\nBuckingham wrote to M. de Fiesque, who was holding Fort La Pree, that he\r\nwas going to embark, without waiting for any more men to make their\r\ndescent upon the island; but the king, who trusted not his enemies, and\r\nleast of all the English, from whom, even when friends, he had received\r\nso many proofs of faithlessness and falsehood, besides that he knew\r\nBuckingham for a man who, from not having the force of character to\r\ndecide on such an occasion, did not know whether to fight or to fly,\r\ncontinued in his first determination to transport promptly all those who\r\nremained, in order to encounter the enemy on land, fight them, and make\r\nthem for the future quake with fear if it were proposed to them to try\r\nanother descent upon his dominions.\r\n\r\nMarshal Schomberg, thwarted by bad weather, had just rallied his troops\r\nwhich had been cast by the winds on different parts of the coast, when it\r\nwas perceived that the enemy had sheered off.  M. De Toiras, issuing from\r\nhis fortress to meet the marshal, would have pursued them at once to give\r\nthem battle; but Schomberg refused, saying, “I ought to make them a\r\nbridge of gold rather than a barrier of iron;” and he contented himself\r\nwith following the English, who retreated to a narrow causeway which led\r\nto the little Island of Oie.  There, a furious charge of French cavalry\r\nbroke the ranks of the enemy, disorder spread amongst them, and when\r\nnight came to put an end to the combat, forty flags remained in the hands\r\nof the king’s troops, and he sent them at once to Notre-Dame, by Claude\r\nde St. Simon, together with a quantity of prisoners, of whom the King\r\nmade a present to his sister, the Queen of England.\r\n\r\n“Such,” says the Duke of Rohan, in his Hemoires, “was the success of the\r\nDuke of Buckingham’s expedition, wherein he ruined the reputation of his\r\nnation and his own, consumed a portion of the provisions of the\r\nRochellese, and reduced to despair the party for whose sake he had come\r\nto France.  The Duke of Rohan first learned this bad news by the bonfires\r\nwhich all the Roman Catholics lighted for it all through the countship of\r\nFoix, and, later on, by a despatch from the Duke of Soubise, who exhorted\r\nhim not to lose courage, saying that he hoped to come back next spring in\r\ncondition to efface the affront received.”  This latter prince had not\r\ncovered himself with glory in the expedition.  “As recompense and\r\nconsolation for all their losses,” says the cardinal, “they carried off\r\nSoubise to England.  He has not been mentioned all through this siege,\r\nbecause, whenever there was any question of negotiation, no one would\r\napply to him, but only to Buckingham.  When there was nothing for it but\r\nto fight, he would not hear of it.  On the day the English made their\r\ndescent, he was at La Rochelle; nobody knows where he was at the time of\r\nthe assault, but he was one of the first and most forward in the rout.”\r\n\r\nSoubise had already been pronounced guilty of high-treason by decree of\r\nthe Parliament of Toulouse; but the Duke of Rohan had been degraded from\r\nhis dignities, and “a title offered to those who would assassinate him,\r\nwhich created an inclination in three or four wretches to undertake it,\r\nwho had but a rope or the wheel for recompense, it not being in any human\r\npower to prolong or shorten any man’s life without the permission of\r\nGod.”  The Prince of Conde had been commissioned to fight the valiant\r\nchief of the Huguenots, “for that he was their sworn enemy,” says the\r\ncardinal.  In the eyes of fervent Catholics the name of Conde had many\r\nwrongs for which to obtain pardon.\r\n\r\nThe English were ignominiously defeated; the king was now confronted by\r\nnone but his revolted subjects; he resolved to blockade the place at all\r\npoints, so that it could not be entered by land or sea; and, to this end,\r\nhe claimed from Spain the fleet which had been promised him, and which\r\ndid not arrive.  “The whole difficulty of this enterprise,” said the\r\ncardinal to the king, “lies in this, that the majority will only labor\r\ntherein in a perfunctory manner.”\r\n\r\nHis ordinary penetration did not deceive him: the great lords intrusted\r\nwith commands saw with anxiety the increasing power of Richelieu.  “You\r\nwill see,” said Bassompierre, “that we shall be mad enough to take La\r\nRochelle.”  “His Majesty had just then many of his own kingdom and all\r\nhis allies sworn together against him, and so much the more dangerously\r\nin that it was secretly.  England at open war, and with all her maritime\r\npower but lately on our coasts; the King of Spain apparently united to\r\nhis Majesty, yet, in fact, not only giving him empty words, but, under\r\ncover of the emperor’s name, making a diversion against him in the\r\ndirection of Germany.  Nevertheless the king held firm to his resolve;\r\nand then the siege of La Rochelle was undertaken with a will.”\r\n\r\nThe old Duchess of Rohan (Catherine de Parthenay Larcheveque) had shut\r\nherself up in La Rochelle with her daughter Anne de Rohan, as pious and\r\nas courageous as her mother, and of rare erudition into the bargain; she\r\nhad hitherto refused to leave the town; but, when the blockade commenced,\r\nshe asked leave to retire with two hundred women.  The town had already\r\nbeen refused permission to get rid of useless mouths.  “All the\r\nRochellese shall go out together,” was the answer returned to Madame de\r\nRohan.  She determined to undergo with her brethren in the faith all the\r\nrigors of the siege.  “Secure peace, complete victory, or honorable\r\ndeath,” she wrote to her son the Duke of Rohan: the old device of Jeanne\r\nd’Albret, which had never been forgotten by the brave chief of the\r\nHuguenots.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the burgesses of La Rochelle, as determined as the Duchess\r\nof Rohan to secure their liberties or perish, was the president of the\r\nboard of marine, soon afterwards mayor of the town, John Gutton, a rich\r\nmerchant, whom the misfortunes of the times had wrenched away from his\r\nbusiness to become a skilful admiral, an intrepid soldier, accustomed for\r\nyears past to scour the seas as a corsair.  “He had at his house,” says a\r\nnarrative of those days, “a great number of flags, which he used to show\r\none after another, indicating the princes from whom he had taken them.”\r\n When he was appointed mayor, he drew his poniard and threw it upon the\r\ncouncil-table.  “I accept,” he said, “the honor you have done me, but on\r\ncondition that yonder poniard shall serve to pierce the heart of whoever\r\ndares to speak of surrender, mine first of all, if I were ever wretch\r\nenough to condescend to such cowardice.”  Of indomitable nature, of\r\npassionate and proud character, Guiton, in fact, rejected all proposals\r\nof peace.  “My friend, tell the cardinal that I am his very humble\r\nservant,” was his answer to insinuating speeches as well as to threats;\r\nand he prepared with tranquil coolness for defence to the uttermost.  Two\r\nmunicipal councillors, two burgesses, and a clergyman were commissioned\r\nto judge and to punish spies and traitors; attention was concentrated\r\nupon getting provisions into the town; the country was already\r\ndevastated, but reliance was placed upon promises of help from England;\r\nand religious exercises were everywhere multiplied.  “We will hold out to\r\nthe last day,” reiterated the burgesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Guiton’s Oath----254]\r\n\r\nIt was the month of December; bad weather interfered with the\r\nsiege-works; the king was having a line of circumvallation pushed\r\nforward to close the approaches to the city on the land side; the\r\ncardinal was having a mole of stone-work, occupying the whole breadth of\r\nthe roads, constructed; the king’s little fleet, commanded by M. de\r\nGuise, had been ordered up to protect the laborers; Spain had sent\r\ntwenty-eight vessels in such bad condition that those which were rolled\r\ninto the sea laden with stones were of more value.  “They were employed\r\nSpanish-fashion,” says Richelieu, “that is, to make an appearance so as\r\nto astound the Rochellese by the union of the two crowns.”  A few days\r\nafter their arrival, at the rumor of assistance coming from England, the\r\nSpanish admiral, who had secret orders to make no effort for France,\r\ndemanded permission to withdraw his ships.  “It was very shameful of\r\nthem, but it was thought good to let them go without the king’s consent,\r\nmaking believe that he had given them their dismissal, and desired them\r\nto go and set about preparing, one way or another, a large armament by\r\nthe spring.”  The Rochellese were rejoicing over the treaty they had\r\njust concluded with the King of England, who promised “to aid them by\r\nland and sea, to the best of his kingly power, until he should have\r\nbrought about a fair and secure peace.”  The mole was every moment being\r\nwashed away by the sea; and, “whilst the cardinal was employing all the\r\nwits which God had given him to bring to a successful issue the siege of\r\nLa Rochelle to the glory of God and the welfare of the state, and was\r\nlaboring to that end more than the bodily strength granted to him by God\r\nseemed to permit, one would have said that the sea and the winds,\r\nfavoring the English and the islands, were up in opposition and\r\nthwarting his designs.”\r\n\r\nThe king was growing tired, and wished to go to Paris; but this was not\r\nthe advice of the cardinal, and “the truths he uttered were so\r\ndispleasing to the king that he fell somehow into disgrace.  The dislike\r\nthe king conceived for him was such that he found fault with him about\r\neverything.”  The king at last took his departure, and the cardinal, who\r\nhad attended him “without daring, out of respect, to take his sunshade to\r\nprotect him against the heat of the sun, which was very great that day,”\r\n was on his return taken ill with fever.  “I am so downhearted that I\r\ncannot express the regret I feel at quitting the cardinal, fearing lest\r\nsome accident may happen to him,” the king had said to one of his\r\nservants: “tell him from me to take care of himself, to think what a\r\nstate my affairs would be in if I were to lose him.”  When the king\r\nreturned to La Rochelle on the 10th of April, he found his army\r\nstrengthened, the line of circumvallation finished, and the mole well\r\nadvanced into the sea; the assault was becoming possible, and the king\r\nsummoned the place to surrender.  [_Siege de La Rochelle.  Archives\r\neurieuses de l’Histoire de France,_ t. iii.  p. 102.]  “We recognize no\r\nother sheriffs and governors than ourselves,” answered the sergeant on\r\nguard to the improvised herald sent by the king; “nobody will listen to\r\nyou; away at once!”  It was at last announced that the re-enforcements so\r\nimpatiently expected were coming from England.  “The cardinal, who knew\r\nthat there was nothing so dangerous as to have no fear of one’s enemy,\r\nhad a long while before set everything in order, as if the English might\r\narrive any day.”  Their fleet was signalled at sea; it numbered thirty\r\nvessels, and had a convoy of twenty barks laden with provisions and\r\nmunitions, and it was commanded by the Earl of Denbigh, Buckingham’s\r\nbrother-in-law.  The Rochellese, transported with joy, “had planted a\r\nhost of flags on the prominent points of their town.”  The English came\r\nand cast anchor at the tip of the Island of Re.  The cannon of La\r\nRochelle gave them a royal salute.  A little boat with an English captain\r\non board found means of breaking the blockade; and “Open a passage,” said\r\nthe envoy to the Rochellese, “as you sent notice to us in England, and we\r\nwill deliver you.”  But the progress made in the works of the mole\r\nrendered the enterprise difficult; the besieged could not attempt\r\nanything; they waited and waited for Lord Denbigh to bring on an\r\nengagement; on the 19th of May, all the English ships got under sail and\r\napproached the roads.  The besieged hurried on to the ramparts; there was\r\nthe thunder of one broadside, and one only; and then the vessels tacked\r\nand crowded sail for England, followed by the gaze “of the king’s army,\r\nwho returned to make good cheer without any fear of the enemy, and with\r\ngreat hopes of soon taking the town.”\r\n\r\nGreat was the despair in La Rochelle: “This shameful retreat of the\r\nEnglish, and their aid which had only been received by faith, as they do\r\nin the Eucharist,” wrote Cardinal Richelieu, “astounded the Rochellese so\r\nmightily that they would readily have made up their minds to surrender,\r\nif Madame de Rohan, the mother, whose hopes for her children were all\r\ncentred in the preservation of this town, and the minister Salbert, a\r\nvery seditious fellow, had not regaled them with imaginary succor which\r\nthey made them hope for.”  The cardinal, when he wrote these words, knew\r\nnothing of the wicked proposals made to Guiton and to Salbert.  “Couldn’t\r\nthe cardinal be got rid of by the deed of one determined man?” it was\r\nasked: but the mayor refused; and, “It is not in such a way that God\r\nwilleth our deliverance,” said Salbert; “it would be too offensive to His\r\nholiness.”  And they suffered on.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the 24th of May, the posterns were observed to open, and\r\nthe women to issue forth one after another, with their children and the\r\nold men; they came gliding towards the king’s encampment, but “he ordered\r\nthem to be driven back by force; and further, knowing that they had sown\r\nbeans near the counterscarps of their town, a detachment was sent out to\r\ncut them down as soon as they began to come up, and likewise a little\r\ncorn that they had sown in some dry spots of their marshes.”  Louis the\r\nJust fought the Rochellese in other fashion than that in which Henry the\r\nGreat had fought the Parisians.\r\n\r\nThe misery in the place became frightful; the poor died of hunger, or\r\nwere cut down by the soldiery when they ventured upon shore at low tide\r\nto look for cockles; the price of provisions was such that the richest\r\nalone could get a little meat to eat; a cow fetched two thousand livres,\r\nand a bushel of wheat eight hundred livres.  Madame de Rohan had been the\r\nfirst to have her horses killed, but this resource was exhausted, and her\r\ncook at last “left the town and allowed himself to be taken, saying that\r\nhe would rather be hanged than return to die of hunger.”  A rising even\r\ntook place amongst the inhabitants who were clamorous to surrender, but\r\nGuiton had the revolters hanged.  “I am ready,” said he, “to cast lots\r\nwith anybody else which shall live or be killed to feed his comrade with\r\nhis flesh.  As long as there is one left to keep the gates shut, it is\r\nenough.”  The mutineers were seized with terror, and men died without\r\ndaring to speak. “We have been waiting three months for the effect of the\r\nexcellent letters we received from the King of Great Britain,” wrote\r\nGuiton on the 24th of August, to the deputies from La Rochelle who were\r\nin London, “and, meanwhile, we cannot see by what disasters it happens\r\nthat we remain here in misery without seeing any sign of succor; our men\r\ncan do no more, our inhabitants are dying of hunger in the streets, and\r\nall our families are in a fearful state from mourning, want, and\r\nperplexity; nevertheless, we will hold out to the last day, but in God’s\r\nname delay no longer, for we perish.”  This letter never reached its\r\ndestination; the watchmaker, Marc Biron; who had offered to convey it to\r\nEngland, was arrested whilst attempting to pass the royal lines, and was\r\nimmediately hanged.  La Rochelle, however, still held out. “Their rabid\r\nfury,” says the cardinal, “gave them new strength, or rather the avenging\r\nwrath of God caused them to be supplied therewith in extraordinary\r\nmeasure by his evil spirit, in order to prolong their woes; they were\r\nalready almost at the end thereof, and misery found upon them no more\r\nsubstance whereon it could feed and support itself; they were skeletons,\r\nempty shadows, breathing corpses, rather than living men.”  At the bottom\r\nof his heart, and in spite of the ill temper their resistance caused in\r\nhim, the heroism of the Rochellese excited the cardinal’s admiration.\r\nBuckingham had just been assassinated.  “The king could not have lost a\r\nmore bitter or a more idiotic enemy; his unreasoning enterprises ended\r\nunluckily, but they, nevertheless, did not fail to put us in great peril\r\nand cause us much mischief,” says Richelieu “the idiotic madness of an\r\nenemy being more to be feared than his wisdom, inasmuch as the idiot does\r\nnot act on any principle common to other men, he attempts everything and\r\nanything, violates his own interests, and is restrained by impossibility\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\nIt was this impossibility of any aid that the cardinal attempted to\r\nimpress upon the Rochellese by means of letters which he managed to get\r\ninto the town, representing to them that Buckingham, their protector, was\r\ndead, and that they were allowing themselves to be unjustly tyrannized\r\nover by a small number amongst them, who, being rich, had wheat to eat,\r\nwhereas, if they were good citizens, they would take their share of the\r\ngeneral misery.  These manoeuvres did not remain without effect: the\r\nbesieged resolved to treat, and a deputation was just about to leave the\r\ntown, when a burgess who had broken through the lines arrived in hot\r\nhaste, on his return from England; he had seen, he said, the armament all\r\nready to set out to save them or perish; it must arrive within a week;\r\nthe public body of La Rochelle had promised not to treat without the King\r\nof England’s participation; he was not abandoning his allies; and so the\r\ndeputies returned home, and there was more waiting still.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of September, the English flag appeared before St. Martin de\r\nRe; it was commanded by the Earl of Lindsay, and was composed of a\r\nhundred and forty vessels, which carried six thousand soldiers, besides\r\nthe crews; the French who were of the religion were in the van, commanded\r\nby the Duke of Soubise and the Count of Laval, brother of the Duke of La\r\nTremoille, who had lately renounced his faith in front of La Rochelle,\r\nbeing convinced of his errors by a single lesson from the cardinal.\r\n“This armament was England’s utmost effort, for the Parliament which was\r\nthen being holden had granted six millions of livres to fit it out to\r\navenge the affronts and ignominy which the English nation had encountered\r\non the Island of Re, and afterwards by the shameful retreat of their\r\narmament in the month of May.”  But it was too late coming; the mole was\r\nfinished, and the opening in it defended by two forts; and a floating\r\npalisade blocked the passage as well.  The English sent some petards\r\nagainst this construction, but they produced no effect; and when, next\r\nday, they attacked the royal fleet, the French crews lost but\r\ntwenty-eight men; “the fire-ships were turned aside by men who feared\r\nfire as little as water.”  Lord Lindsay retired with his squadron to the\r\nshelter of the Island of Aix, sending to the king “Lord Montagu to\r\npropose some terms of accommodation.”  He demanded pardon for the\r\nRochellese, freedom of conscience, and quarter for the English garrison\r\nin La Rochelle; the answer was, “that the Rochellese were subjectss of\r\nthe king, who knew quite well what he had to do with them, and that the\r\nKing of England had no right to interfere.  As for the English, they\r\nshould meet with the same treatment as was received by the French whom\r\nthey held prisoners.” Montagu set out for England to obtain further\r\norders from the king his master.\r\n\r\nAll hope of effectual aid was gone, and the Rochellese felt it; the\r\nFrench who were on board the English fleet had taken, like them, a\r\nresolution to treat; and they had already sent to the cardinal when, on\r\nthe 29th of October, the deputies from La Rochelle arrived at the camp.\r\n“Your fellows who were in the English army have already obtained grace,”\r\n said the cardinal to them; and when they were disposed not to believe it,\r\nthe cardinal sent for the pastors Vincent and Gobert, late delegates to\r\nKing Charles I. “they embraced with tears in their eyes, not daring to\r\nspeak of business, as they had been forbidden to do so on pain of death.”\r\n\r\nThe demands of the Rochellese were more haughty than befitted their\r\nextreme case.  “Though they were but shadows of living men, and their\r\nlife rested solely on the king’s mercy, they actually dared,\r\nnevertheless, to propose to the cardinal a general treaty on behalf of\r\nall those of their party, including Madame de Rohan and Monsieur de\r\nSoubise, the maintenance of their privileges, of their governor, and of\r\ntheir mayor, together with the right of those bearing arms to march out\r\nwith beat of drum and lighted match” [with the honors of war].\r\n\r\nThe cardinal was amused at their impudence, he writes in his _Memoires,_\r\nand told them that they had no right to expect anything more than pardon,\r\nwhich, moreover, they did not deserve.  “He was nevertheless anxious to\r\nconclude, wishing that Montagu should find peace made, and that the\r\nEnglish fleet should see it made without their consent, which would\r\nrender the rest of the king’s business easier, whether as regarded\r\nEngland or Spain, or the interior of the kingdom.”  On the 28th the\r\ntreaty, or rather the grace, was accordingly signed, “the king granting\r\nlife and property to those of the inhabitants of the town who were then\r\nin it, and the exercise of the religion within La Rochelle.”  These\r\narticles bore the signature of a brigadier-general, M. de Marillac, the\r\nking not having thought proper to put his name at the bottom of a\r\nconvention made with his subjects.\r\n\r\nNext day, twelve deputies issued from the town, making a request for\r\nhorses to Marshal de Bassompierre, whose quarters were close by, for they\r\nhad not strength to walk.  They dismounted on approaching the king’s\r\nquarters, and the cardinal presented them to his Majesty.  “Sir,” said\r\nthey, “we do acknowledge our crimes and rebellions, and demand mercy;\r\npromising to remain faithful for the future, if your Majesty deigns to\r\nremember the services we were able to render to the king your father.”\r\n\r\nThe king gazed upon these suppliants kneeling at his feet, deputies from\r\nthe proud city which had kept him more than a year at her gates;\r\nfleshless, almost fainting, they still bore on their features the traces\r\nof the haughty past.  They had kept the lilies of France on their walls,\r\nrefusing to the last to give themselves to England.  “Better surrender to\r\na king who could take Rochelle, than to one who couldn’t succor her,”\r\n said the mayor, “John Guiton, who was asked if he would not become an\r\nEnglish subject.  “I know that you have always been malignants,” said the\r\nking at last, “and that you have done all you could to shake off the yoke\r\nof obedience to me; I forgive you, nevertheless, your rebellions, and\r\nwill be a good prince to you, if your actions conform to your\r\nprotestations.”  Thereupon he dismissed them, not without giving them a\r\ndinner, and sent victuals into the town; without which, all that remained\r\nwould have been dead of hunger within two days.\r\n\r\nThe fighting men marched out, “the officers and gentlemen wearing their\r\nswords and the soldiery with bare (white) staff in hand,” according to\r\nthe conventions; as they passed they were regarded with amazement, there\r\nnot being more than sixty-four Frenchmen and ninety English: all the rest\r\nhad been killed in sorties or had died of want.  The cardinal at the same\r\ntime entered this city, which he had subdued by sheer perseverance;\r\nGuiton came to meet him with six archers; he had not appeared during the\r\nnegotiations, saying that his duty detained him in the town.  “Away with\r\nyou!” said the cardinal, “and at once dismiss your archers, taking care\r\nnot to style yourself mayor any more on pain of death.”  Guiton made no\r\nreply, and went his way quietly to his house, a magnificent dwelling till\r\nlately, but now lying desolate amidst the general ruin.  He was not\r\ndestined to reside there long; the heroic defender of La Rochelle was\r\nobliged to leave the town and retire to Tournay-Boutonne.  He returned to\r\nLa Rochelle to die, in 1656.\r\n\r\nThe king made his entry into the subjugated town on the 1st of November,\r\n1628: it was full of corpses in the chambers, the houses, the public\r\nthoroughfares; for those who still survived were so weak that they had\r\nnot been able to bury the dead.  Madame de Rohan and her daughter, who\r\nhad not been included in the treaty, were not admitted to the honor of\r\nseeing his Majesty.  “For having been the brand that had consumed this\r\npeople,” they were sent to prison at Niort; “there kept captive, without\r\nexercise of their religion, and so strictly that they had but one\r\ndomestic to wait upon them, all which, however, did not take from them\r\ntheir courage or wonted zeal for the good of their party.  The mother\r\nsent word to the Duke of Rohan, her son, that he was to put no faith in\r\nher letters, since she might be made to write them by force, and that no\r\nconsideration of her pitiable condition should make her flinch to the\r\nprejudice of her party, whatever harm she might be made to suffer.”\r\n [_Memoires du Duc de Rohan,_ t. i.  p. 395.]  Worn out by so much\r\nsuffering, the old Duchess of Rohan died in 1631 at her castle Du Pare:\r\nshe had been released from captivity by the pacification of the South.\r\n\r\nWith La Rochelle fell the last bulwark of religious liberties.\r\nSingle-handed, Duke Henry of Rohan now resisted at the head of a handful\r\nof resolute men.  But he was about to be crushed in his turn.  The\r\ncapture of La Rochelle had raised the cardinal’s power to its height; it\r\nhad, simultaneously, been the death-blow to the Huguenot party and to\r\nthe factions of the grandees.  “One of them was bold enough to say,” on\r\nseeing that La Rochelle was lost, “Now we may well say that we are all\r\nlost.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu_]\r\n\r\nUpper Languedoc had hitherto refused to take part in the rising, and the\r\nPrince of Conde was advancing on Toulouse when the Duke of Rohan\r\nattempted a bold enterprise against Montpellier.  He believed that he was\r\nsure of his communications with the interior of the town; but when the\r\ndetachment of the advance-guard got a footing on the draw-bridge the\r\nropes that held it were cut, and “the soldiers fell into a ditch, where\r\nthey were shot down with arquebuses, at the same time that musketry\r\nplayed upon them from without.”  The lieutenant fell back in all haste\r\nupon the division of the Duke of Rohan, who retreated “to the best\r\nVillages between Montpellier and Lunel, without ever a man from\r\nMontpellier going out to follow and see whither he went.”  The war was\r\nwasting Languedoc, Viverais, and Rouergue; the Dukes of Montmorency and\r\nVentadour, under the orders of the Prince of Conde, were pursuing the\r\ntroops of Rohan in every direction; the burgesses of Montauban had\r\ndeclared for the Reformers, and were ravaging the lands of their Catholic\r\nneighbors in return for the frightful ruin everywhere caused by the royal\r\ntroops.  The wretched peasantry laid the blame on the Duke of Rohan,\r\n“for one of the greatest misfortunes connected with the position of\r\nparty-chiefs is this necessity they lie under of accounting for all their\r\nactions to the people, that is, to a monster composed of numberless\r\nheads, amongst which there is scarcely one open to reason.” [_Memoires de\r\nMontmorency.]  “Whoso has to do with a people that considers nothing\r\ndifficult to undertake, and, as for the execution, makes no sort of\r\nprovision, is apt to be much hampered,” writes the Duke of Rohan in his\r\n_Memoires_ (t. i.  p. 376).  It was this extreme embarrassment that\r\nlanded him in crime.  One of his emissaries, returning from Piedmont,\r\nwhere he had been admitted to an interview with the ambassador of Spain,\r\nmade overtures to him on behalf of that power “which had an interest, he\r\nsaid, in a prolongation of the hostilities in France, so as to be able to\r\npeaceably achieve its designs in Italy.  The great want of money in which\r\nthe said duke then found himself, the country being unable to furnish\r\nmore, and the towns being unwilling to do anything further, there being\r\nnothing to hope from England, and nothing but words without deeds having\r\nbeen obtained from the Duke of Savoy, absolutely constrained him to find\r\nsome means of raising it in order to subsist.”  And so, in the following\r\nyear, the Duke of Rohan treated with the King of Spain, who promised to\r\nallow him annually three hundred thousand ducats for the keep of his\r\ntroops and forty thousand for himself.  In return the duke, who looked\r\nforward to “the time when he and his might make themselves sufficiently\r\nstrong to canton themselves and form a separate state,” promised, in that\r\nstate, freedom and enjoyment of their property to all Catholics.  A piece\r\nof strange and culpable blindness for which Rohan was to pay right\r\ndearly.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this cruel partisan war that the duke heard of the\r\nfall of La Rochelle; he could not find fault “with folks so attenuated by\r\nfamine that the majority of them could not support themselves without a\r\nstick, for having sought safety in capitulation;” but to the continual\r\nanxiety felt by him for the fate of his mother and sister was added\r\ndisquietude as to the effect that this news might produce on his troops.\r\n“The people, weary of and ruined by the war, and naturally disposed to be\r\nvery easily cast down by adversity; the tradesmen annoyed at having no\r\nmore chance of turning a penny; the burgesses seeing their possessions in\r\nruins and uncultivated; all were inclined for peace at any price\r\nwhatever.”  The Prince of  Conde, whilst cruelly maltreating the\r\ncountries in revolt, had elsewhere had the prudence to observe some\r\ngentle measures towards the peaceable Reformers in the hope of thus\r\nproducing submission.  He made this quite clear himself when writing to\r\nthe Duke of Rohan: “Sir, the king’s express commands to maintain them of\r\nthe religion styled Reformed in entire liberty of conscience have caused\r\nme to hitherto preserve those who remain in due obedience to his Majesty\r\nin all Catholic places, countries as well as towns, in entire liberty.\r\nJustice has run its free course, the worship continues everywhere, save\r\nin two or three spots where it served not for the exercise of religion,\r\nbut to pave the way for rebellion.  The officers who came out of rebel\r\ncities have kept their commissions; in a word, the treatment of so-styled\r\nReformers, when obedient, has been the same as that of Catholics faithful\r\nto the king .  .  .”  To which Henry de Rohan replied, “I confess to have\r\nonce taken up arms unadvisedly, in so far as it was not on behalf of the\r\naffairs of our religion, but of those of yourself personally, who\r\npromised to obtain us reparation for the infractions of our treaties,\r\nand you did nothing of the kind, having had thoughts of peace before\r\nreceiving news from the general assembly.  Since that time everybody\r\nknows that I have had arms in my hands only from sheer necessity, in\r\norder to defend our properties, our lives, and the freedom of our\r\nconsciences.  I seek my repose in heaven, and God will give me grace to\r\nalways find that of my conscience on earth.  They say that in this war\r\nyou have, not made a bad thing of it.  This gives me some assurance that\r\nyou will leave our poor Uvennes at peace, seeing that there are more hard\r\nknocks than pistoles to be got there.”  The Prince of  Conde avenged\r\nhimself for this stinging reply by taking possession, in Brittany, of all\r\nthe Duke of Rohan’s property, which had been confiscated, and of which\r\nthe king had made him a present.  There were more pistoles to be picked\r\nup on the duke’s estates than in the Cevennes.\r\n\r\nThe king was in Italy, and the Reformers hoped that his affairs would\r\ndetain him there a long while; but “God, who had disposed it otherwise,\r\nbreathed upon all those projects,” and the arms of Louis XIII. were\r\neverywhere victorious; peace was concluded with Piedmont and England,\r\nwithout the latter treaty making any mention of the Huguenots.  The king\r\nthen turned his eyes towards Languedoc, and, summoning to him the Dukes\r\nof Montmorency and Schomberg, he laid siege to Privas.  The cardinal soon\r\njoined him there, and it was on the day of his arrival that the treaty\r\nwith England was proclaimed by heralds beneath the walls.  The besieged\r\nthus learned that their powerful ally had abandoned them without reserve;\r\nat the first assault the inhabitants fled into the country, the garrison\r\nretired within the forts, and the king’s-soldiers, penetrating into the\r\ndeserted streets, were able, without resistance, to deliver up the town\r\nto pillage and flames.  When the affrighted inhabitants came back by\r\nlittle and little within their walls, they found the houses confiscated\r\nto the benefit of the king, who invited a new population to inhabit\r\nPrivas.\r\n\r\nTown after town, “fortified Huguenot-wise,” surrendered, opening to the\r\nroyal armies the passage to the Uvennes.  The Duke of Rohan, who had at\r\nfirst taken position at Nimes, repaired to Anduze for the defence of the\r\nmountains, the real fortress of the Reformation in Languedoc.  Alais\r\nitself had just opened its gates.  Rohan saw that he could no longer\r\nimpose the duty of resistance upon a people weary of suffering, “easily\r\nbelieving ill of good folks, and readily agreeing with those whiners who\r\nblame everything and do nothing.”  He sent “to the king, begging to be\r\nreceived to mercy, thinking it better to resolve on peace, whilst he\r\ncould still make some show of being able to help it, than to be forced,\r\nafter a longer resistance, to surrender to the king with a rope round his\r\nneck.”  The cardinal advised the king to show the duke grace, “well\r\nknowing that, together with him individually, the other cities, whether\r\nthey wished it or not, would be obliged to do the like, there being but\r\nlittle resolution and constancy in people deprived of leaders, especially\r\nwhen they are threatened with immediate harm, and see no door of escape\r\nopen.”\r\n\r\nThe general assembly of the Reformers, which was then in meeting at\r\nNimes, removed to Anduze to deliberate with the Duke of Rohan; a wish was\r\nexpressed to have the opinion of the province of the Cevennes, and all\r\nthe deputies repaired to the king’s presence.  No more surety-towns;\r\nfortifications everywhere razed, at the expense and by the hands of the\r\nReformers; the Catholic worship re-established in all the churches of the\r\nReformed towns; and, at this price, an amnesty granted for all acts of\r\nrebellion, and religious liberties confirmed anew,--such were the\r\nconditions of the peace signed at Alais on the 28th of June, 1629, and\r\nmade public the following month at Nimes, under the name of Edict of\r\nGrace.  Montauban alone refused to submit to them.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Rohan left France and retired to Venice, where his wife and\r\ndaughter were awaiting him.  He had been appointed by the Venetian senate\r\ngeneralissimo of the forces of the republic, when the cardinal, who had\r\nno doubt preserved some regard for his military talents, sent him an\r\noffer of the command of the king’s troops in the Valteline.  There he for\r\nseveral years maintained the honor of France, being at one time abandoned\r\nand at another supported by the cardinal, who ultimately left him to bear\r\nthe odium of the last reverse.  Meeting with no response from the court,\r\ncut off from every resource, he brought back into the district of Gex the\r\nFrench troops driven out by the Grisons themselves, and then retired to\r\nGeneva.  Being threatened with the king’s wrath, he set out for the camp\r\nof his friend Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar; and it was whilst fighting at\r\nhis side against the imperialists that he received the wound of which he\r\ndied in Switzerland, on the 16th of April, 1638.  His body was removed to\r\nGeneva amidst public mourning.  A man of distinguished mind and noble\r\ncharacter, often wild in his views and hopes, and so deeply absorbed in\r\nthe interests of his party and of his church, that he had sometimes the\r\nmisfortune to forget those of his country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the king had set out for Paris, and the cardinal was marching\r\non Montauban.  Being obliged to halt at Pezenas because he had a fever,\r\nhe there received a deputation from Montauban, asking to have its\r\nfortifications preserved.  On the minister’s formal refusal, supported by\r\na movement in advance on the part of Marshal Bassompierre with the army,\r\nthe town submitted unreservedly.  “Knowing that the cardinal had made up\r\nhis mind to enter in force, they found this so bitter a pill that they\r\ncould scarcely swallow it;” they, nevertheless, offered the dais to the\r\nminister, as they had been accustomed to do to the governor, but he\r\nrefused it, and would not suffer the consuls to walk on foot beside his\r\nhorse.  Bassompierre set guards at the doors of the meeting-house, that\r\nthings might be done without interruption or scandal; it was ascertained\r\nthat the Parliament of Toulouse, “habitually intractable in all that\r\nconcerned religion,” had enregistered the edict without difficulty; the\r\ngentlemen of the neighborhood came up in crowds, the Reformers to make\r\ntheir submission and the Catholics to congratulate the cardinal; on the\r\nday of his departure the pickaxe was laid to the fortifications of\r\nMontauban; those of Castres were already beginning to fall; and the\r\nHuguenot party in France was dead.  Deprived of the political guarantees\r\nwhich had been granted them by Henry IV., the Reformers had nothing for\r\nit but to retire into private life.  This was the commencement of their\r\nmaterial prosperity; they henceforth transferred to commerce and,\r\nindustry all the intelligence, courage, and spirit of enterprise that\r\nthey had but lately displayed in the service of their cause, on the\r\nbattle-field or in the cabinets of kings.\r\n\r\n“From that time,” says Cardinal Richelieu, “difference in religion never\r\nprevented me from rendering the Huguenots all sorts of good offices, and\r\nI made no distinction between Frenchmen but in respect of fidelity.”  A\r\ngrand assertion, true at bottom, in spite of the frequent grievances that\r\nthe Reformers had often to make the best of; the cardinal was more\r\ntolerant than his age and his servants; what he had wanted to destroy was\r\nthe political party; he did not want to drive the Reformers to extremity,\r\nnor force them to fly the country; happy had it been if Louis XIV. could\r\nhave listened to and borne in mind the instructions given by Richelieu to\r\nCount de Sault, commissioned to see after the application in Dauphiny of\r\nthe edicts of pacification: “I hold that, as there is no need to extend\r\nin favor of them of the religion styled Reformed that which is provided\r\nby the edicts, so there is no ground for cutting down the favors granted\r\nthem thereby; even now, when, by the grace of God, peace is so firmly\r\nestablished in the kingdom, too much precaution cannot be used for the\r\nprevention of all these discontents amongst the people.  I do assure you\r\nthat the king’s veritable intention is to have all his subjects living\r\npeaceably in the observation of his edicts, and that those who have\r\nauthority in the provinces will do him service by conforming thereto.”\r\n The era of liberty passed away with Henry IV.; that of tolerance, for the\r\nReformers, began with Richelieu, pending the advent with Louis XIV. of\r\nthe day of persecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.----LOUIS XIII., CARDINAL RICHELIEU, AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\nFrance was reduced to submission; six years of power had sufficed for\r\nRichelieu to obtain the mastery; from that moment he directed his\r\nceaseless energy towards Europe.  “He feared the repose of peace,” said\r\nthe ambassador Nani in his letters to Venice; “and thinking himself more\r\nsafe amidst the bustle of arms, he was the originator of so many wars,\r\nand of such long-continued and heavy calamities, he caused so much blood\r\nand so many tears to flow within and without the kingdom, that there is\r\nnothing to be astonished at, if many people have represented him as\r\nfaithless, atrocious in his hatred, and inflexible in his vengeance.\r\nBut no one, nevertheless, can deny him the gifts that this world is\r\naccustomed to attribute to its greatest men; and his most determined\r\nenemies are forced to confess that he had so many and such great ones,\r\nthat he would have carried with him power and prosperity wherever he\r\nmight have had the direction of affairs.  We may say that, having brought\r\nback unity to divided France, having succored Italy, upset the empire,\r\nconfounded England, and enfeebled Spain, he was the instrument chosen by\r\ndivine Providence to direct the great events of Europe.”\r\n\r\nThe Venetian’s independent and penetrating mind did not mislead him;\r\neverywhere in Europe were marks of Richelieu’s handiwork.  “There must be\r\nno end to negotiations near and far,” was his saying: he had found\r\nnegotiations succeed in France; he extended his views; numerous treaties\r\nhad already marked the early years of the cardinal’s power; and, after\r\n1630, his activity abroad was redoubled.  Between 1623 and 1642\r\nseventy-four treaties were concluded by Richelieu: four with England;\r\ntwelve with the United Provinces; fifteen with the princes of Germany;\r\nsix with Sweden; twelve with Savoy; six with the republic of Venice;\r\nthree with the pope; three with the emperor; two with Spain; four with\r\nLorraine; one with the Grey Leagues of Switzerland; one with Portugal;\r\ntwo with the revolters of Catalonia and Roussillon; one with Russia; two\r\nwith the Emperor of Morocco: such was the immense network of diplomatic\r\nnegotiations whereof the cardinal held the threads during nineteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAn enumeration of the alliances would serve, without further comment,\r\nto prove this: that the foreign policy of Richelieu was a continuation\r\nof that of Henry IV.; it was to Protestant alliances that he looked for\r\ntheir support in order to maintain the struggle against the house of\r\nAustria, whether the German or the Spanish branch.  In order to give his\r\nviews full swing, he waited till he had conquered the Huguenots at home:\r\nnearly all his treaties with Protestant powers are posterior to 1630.\r\nSo soon as he was secure that no political discussions in France itself\r\nwould come to thwart his foreign designs, he marched with a firm step\r\ntowards that enfeeblement of Spain and that upsetting of the empire of\r\nwhich Nani speaks.  Henry IV. and Queen Elizabeth, pursuing the same end,\r\nhad sought and found the same allies: Richelieu had the good fortune,\r\nbeyond theirs, to meet, for the execution of his designs, with Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, King of Sweden.\r\n\r\nRichelieu had not yet entered the king’s council (1624), when the\r\nbreaking off of the long negotiations between England and Spain, on the\r\nsubject of the marriage of the Prince of Wales with the Infanta, was\r\nofficially declared to Parliament.  At the very moment when Prince\r\nCharles, with the Duke of Buckingham, was going post-haste to Madrid, to\r\nsee the Infanta Mary Anne of Spain, they were already thinking, at Paris,\r\nof marrying him to Henrietta of France, the king’s young sister, scarcely\r\nfourteen years of age.  King James I. was at that time obstinately bent\r\nupon his plan of alliance with Spain; when it failed, his son and big\r\nfavorite forced his hand to bring him round to France.  His envoys at\r\nParis, the Earl of Carlisle and Lord Holland, found themselves confronted\r\nby Cardinal Richelieu, commissioned, together with some of his\r\ncolleagues, to negotiate the affair.  M. Guizot, in his _Projet de\r\nMariage royal_ (1 vol.  18mo: 1863; Paris, Hachette et Cie), has said\r\nthat the marriage of Henry IV.’s daughter with the Prince of Wales was,\r\nin Richelieu’s eyes, one of the essential acts of a policy necessary to\r\nthe greatness of the kingship and of France.  He obtained the best\r\nconditions possible for the various interests involved, but without any\r\nstickling and without favor for such and such a one of these interests,\r\nskilfully adapting words and appearance, but determined upon attaining\r\nhis end.\r\n\r\nThe tarryings and miscarriages of Spanish policy had warned Richelieu to\r\nmake haste.  “In less than nine moons,” says James I.’s private\r\nsecretary, James Howell, “this great matter was proposed, prosecuted, and\r\naccomplished; whereas the sun might, for as many years, have run his\r\ncourse from one extremity of the zodiac to the other, before the court of\r\nSpain would have arrived at any resolution and conclusion.  That gives a\r\ngood idea of the difference between the two nations--the leaden step of\r\nthe one and the quicksilver movements of the other.  It also shows that\r\nthe Frenchman is more noble in his proceedings, less full of scruple,\r\nreserve, and distrust, and that he acts more chivalrously.”\r\n\r\nIn France, meanwhile, as well as in Spain, the question of religion was\r\nthe rock of offence.  Richelieu confined himself to demanding, in a\r\ngeneral way, that, in this matter, the King of England should grant,\r\nin order to obtain the sister of the King of France, all that he had\r\npromised in order to obtain the King of Spain’s.  “So much was required,”\r\n he said, “by the equality of the two crowns.”\r\n\r\nThe English negotiators were much embarrassed; the Protestant feelings\r\nof Parliament had shown themselves very strongly on the subject of the\r\nSpanish marriage.  “As to public freedom for the Catholic religion,” says\r\nthe cardinal, “they would not so much as hear of it, declaring that it\r\nwas a deaign, under cover of alliance, to destroy their constitution even\r\nto ask such a thing of them.”  “You want to conclude the marriage,” said\r\nLord Holland to the queen-mother, “and yet you enter on the same paths\r\nthat the Spaniards took to break it off; which causes all sorts of doubts\r\nand mistrusts, the effect whereof the premier minister of Spain, Count\r\nOlivarez, is very careful to aggravate by saying that, if the pope\r\ngranted a dispensation for the marriage with France, the king his master\r\nwould march to Rome with an army, and give it up to sack.”\r\n\r\n“We will soon stop that,” answered Mary de’ Medici quickly; “we will cut\r\nout work for him elsewhere.”  At last it was agreed that King James and\r\nhis son should sign a private engagement, not inserted in the contract of\r\nmarriage, “securing to the English Catholics more liberty and freedom in\r\nall that concerns their religion, than they would have obtained by virtue\r\nof any articles whatsoever accorded by the marriage treaty with Spain,\r\nprovided that they made sparing use of them, rendering to the King of\r\nEngland the “obedience owed by good and true subjects; the which king,\r\nof his benevolence, would not bind them by any oath contrary to their\r\nreligion.”  The promises were vague and the securities anything but\r\nsubstantial; still, the vanity as well as the fears of King James were\r\nappeased, and Richelieu had secured, simultaneously with his own\r\nascendency, the policy of France.  Nothing remained but to send to Rome\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining the dispensation.  The ordinary ambassador,\r\nCount de Bethune, did not suffice for so delicate a negotiation;\r\nRichelieu sent Father Berulle. Father Berulle, founder of the brotherhood\r\nof the Oratory, patron of the Carmelites, and the intimate friend of\r\nFrancis de Sales, though devoid of personal ambition, had, been clever\r\nenough to keep himself on good terms with Cardinal Richelieu, whose\r\npolitical views he did not share, and with the court of Rome, whose most\r\nfaithful allies, the Jesuits, he had often thwarted.  He was devoted to\r\nQueen Mary de’ Medici, and willingly promoted her desires in the matter\r\nof her daughter’s marriage.  He found the court of Rome in confusion, and\r\nmuch exercised by Spanish intrigue.  “This court,” he wrote to the\r\ncardinal, “is, in conduct and in principles, very different from what\r\none would suppose before having tried it for one’s self; for my part, I\r\nconfess to having learned more of it in a few hours, since I have been on\r\nthe spot, than I knew by all the talk that I have heard.  The dial\r\nconstantly observed in this country is the balance existing between\r\nFrance, Italy, and Spain.”  “The king my master,” said Count de Bethune,\r\nquite openly, “has obtained from England all he could; it is no use to\r\nwait for more ample conditions, or to measure them by the Spanish ell;\r\nI have orders against sending off any courier save to give notice of\r\nconcession of the dispensation: otherwise there would be nothing but\r\nasking one thing after another.”  “If we determine to act like Spain, we,\r\nlike her, shall lose everything,” said Father Berulle.  Some weeks later,\r\non the 6th of January, 1625, Berulle wrote to the cardinal, “For a month\r\nI have been on the point of starting, but we have been obliged to take so\r\nmuch trouble and have so many meetings on the subject of transcripts and\r\nmissives as well as the kernel of the business .  .  .  I will merely\r\ntell you that the dispensation is pure and simple.”\r\n\r\nKing James I. had died on the 6th of April, 1625; and so it was King\r\nCharles I., and not the Prince of Wales, whom the Duke of Chevreuse\r\nrepresented at Paris on the 11th of May, 1625, at the espousals of\r\nPrincess Henrietta Maria.  She set out on the 2d of June for England,\r\nescorted by the Duke of Buckingham, who had been sent by the king to\r\nfetch her, and who had gladly prolonged his stay in France, smitten as he\r\nwas by the young Queen Anne of Austria.  Charles I. went to Dover to meet\r\nhis wife, showing himself very amiable and attentive to her.  Though she\r\nlittle knew how fatal they would be to her, the king of England’s palaces\r\nlooked bare and deserted to the new queen, accustomed as she was to\r\nFrench elegance; she, however, appeared contented.  “How can your Majesty\r\nreconcile yourself to a Huguenot for a husband?” asked one of her suite,\r\nindiscreetly.  “Why not?” she replied, with spirit.  “Was not my father\r\none?”\r\n\r\nBy this speech Henrietta Maria expressed, undoubtedly without realizing\r\nall its grandeur, the idea which had suggested her marriage and been\r\nprominent in France during the whole negotiations.  It was the policy of\r\nHenry IV. that Henry IV.’s daughter was bringing to a triumphant issue.\r\nThe marriage between Henrietta Maria and Charles I., negotiated and\r\nconcluded by Cardinal Richelieu, was the open declaration of the fact\r\nthat the style of Protestant or Catholic was not the supreme law of\r\npolicy in Christian Europe, and that the interests of nations should not\r\nremain subservient to the religious faith of the reigning or governing\r\npersonages.\r\n\r\nUnhappily the policy of Henry IV., carried on by Cardinal Richelieu,\r\nfound no Queen Elizabeth any longer on the throne of England to\r\ncomprehend it and maintain it.  Charles I., tossed about between the\r\nhaughty caprices of his favorite Buckingham and the religious or\r\npolitical passions of his people, did not long remain attached to the\r\ngreat idea which had predominated in the alliance of the two crowns.\r\nProud and timid, imperious and awkward, all at the same time, he did not\r\nsucceed, in the first instance, in gaining the affections of his young\r\nwife, and early infractions of the treaty of marriage; the dismissal of\r\nall the queen’s French servants, hostilities between the merchant navies\r\nof the two nations, had for some time been paving the way for open war,\r\nwhen the Duke of Buckingham, in the hope of winning back to him the House\r\nof Commons (June, 1626), madly attempted the expedition against the\r\nIsland of Re.  What was the success of it, as well as of the two attempts\r\nthat followed it, has already been shown.\r\n\r\nThree years later, on the 24th of April, 1629, the King of England\r\nconcluded peace with France without making any stipulation in favor of\r\nthe Reformers whom hope of aid from him had drawn into rebellion.  “I\r\ndeclare,” says the Duke of Rohan, “that I would have suffered any sort of\r\nextremity rather than be false to the many sacred oaths we had given him\r\nnot to listen to any treaty without him, who had many times assured us\r\nthat he would never make peace without including us in it.”  The English\r\naccepted the peace “as the king had desired, not wanting the King of\r\nGreat Britain to meddle with his rebellious Huguenot subjects any more\r\nthan he would want to meddle with his Catholic subjects if they were to\r\nrebel against him.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. iv.  p. 421.]  The\r\nsubjects of Charles I. were soon to rebel against him: and France kept\r\nher word and did not interfere.\r\n\r\nThe Hollanders, with more prudence and ability than distinguished\r\nBuckingham and Charles I., had done better service to the Protestant\r\ncause without ever becoming entangled in the quarrels that divided\r\nFrance; natural enemies as they were of Spain and the house of Austria,\r\nthey readily seconded Richelieu in the struggle he maintained against\r\nthem; besides, the United Provinces were as yet poor, and the cardinal\r\nalways managed to find money for his allies; nearly all the treaties he\r\nconcluded with Holland were treaties of alliance and subsidy; those of\r\n1641 and 1642 secured to them twelve hundred thousand livres a year out\r\nof the coffers of France.  Once only the Hollanders were faithless to\r\ntheir engagements: it was during the siege of Rochelle, when the national\r\nfeeling would not admit of war being made on the French Huguenots.  All\r\nthe forces of Protestantism readily united against Spain; Richelieu had\r\nbut to direct them.  She, in fact, was the great enemy, and her\r\nhumiliation was always the ultimate aim of the cardinal’s foreign policy;\r\nthe struggle, power to power, between France and Spain, explains, during\r\nthat period, nearly all the political and military complications in\r\nEurope.  There was no lack of pretexts for bringing it on.  The first was\r\nthe question of the Valteline, a lovely and fertile valley, which,\r\nextending from the Lake of Como to the Tyrol, thus serves as a natural\r\ncommunication between Italy and Germany.  Possessed but lately, as it\r\nwas, by the Grey Leagues of the Protestant Swiss, the Valteline, a\r\nCatholic district, had revolted at the instigation of Spain in 1620; the\r\nemperor, Savoy, and Spain had wanted to divide the spoil between them;\r\nwhen France, the old ally of the Grisons, had interfered, and, in 1623,\r\nthe forts of the Valteline had been intrusted on deposit to the pope,\r\nUrban VIII.  He still retained them in 1624, when the Grison lords,\r\nseconded by a French re-enforcement under the orders of the Marquis of\r\nCeeuvres, attacked the feeble garrison of the Valteline; in a few days\r\nthey were masters of all the places in the canton; the pope sent his\r\nnephew, Cardinal Barberini, to Paris to complain of French aggression,\r\nand with a proposal to take the sovereignty of the Valteline from the\r\nGrisons; that was, to give it to Spain.  “Besides,” said Cardinal\r\nRichelieu, “the precedent and consequences of it would be perilous for\r\nkings in whose dominions it hath pleased God to permit diversity of\r\nreligion.”  The legate could obtain nothing.  The Assembly of Notables,\r\nconvoked by Richelieu in 1625, approved of the king’s conduct, and war\r\nwas resolved upon.  The siege of La Rochelle retarded it for two years;\r\nRichelieu wanted to have his hands free; he concluded a specious peace\r\nwith Spain, and the Valteline remained for the time being in the hands of\r\nthe Grisons, who were one day themselves to drive the French out of it.\r\nWhilst the cardinal was holding La Rochelle besieged, the Duke of Mantua\r\nhad died in Italy, and his natural heir, Charles di Gonzaga, who was\r\nsettled in France with the title of Duke of Nevers, had hastened to put\r\nhimself in possession of his dominions.  Meanwhile the Duke of Savoy\r\nclaimed the marquisate of Montferrat; the Spaniards supported him; they\r\nentered the-dominions of the Duke of Mantua, and laid siege to Casale.\r\nWhen La Rochelle succumbed, Casale was still holding out; but the Duke of\r\nSavoy had already made himself master of the greater part of Montferrat;\r\nthe Duke of Mantua claimed the assistance of the King of France, whose\r\nsubject he was; here was a fresh battle-field against Spain; and scarcely\r\nhad he been victorious over the Rochellese, when the king was on the\r\nmarch for Italy.  The Duke of Savoy refused a passage to the royal army,\r\nwhich found the defile of Suza Pass fortified with three barricades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Defile of Suza Pass----278]\r\n\r\nMarshal Bassompierre went to the king, who was a hundred paces behind the\r\nstorming party, ahead of his regiment of guards.  “‘Sir,’ said he, ‘the\r\ncompany is ready, the violins have come in,’ and the masks are at the\r\ndoor; when your Majesty pleases, we will commence the ballet.’  ‘The king\r\ncame up to me, and said to me angrily, “Do you know, pray, that we have\r\nbut five hundred pounds of lead in the park of artillery?” ‘I said to\r\nhim, ‘It is a pretty time to think of that.  Must the ballet not dance,\r\nfor lack of one mask that is not ready?  Leave it to us, sir, and all\r\nwill go well.’  “Do you answer for it?”  said he to me.  ‘Sir,’ replied.\r\nthe cardinal, ‘by the marshal’s looks I prophesy that all will be well;\r\nrest assured of it.’” [_Memoires de Bassompiere._]  The French dashed\r\nforward, the marshals with the storming party, and the barricades were\r\nsoon carried.  The Duke of Savoy and his son had hardly time to fly.\r\n“Gentlemen,” cried the Duke to some Frenchmen, who happened to be in his\r\nservice, “gentlemen, allow me to pass; your countrymen are in a temper.”\r\n\r\nWith the same dash, on debouching from the mountains, the king’s troops\r\nentered Suza.  The Prince of Piedmont soon arrived to ask for peace; he\r\ngave up all pretensions to Montferrat, and promised to negotiate with the\r\nSpanish general to get the siege of Casale raised; and the effect was\r\nthat, on the 18th of March, Casale, delivered “by the mere wind of the\r\nrenown gained by the king’s arms, saw, with tears of joy, the Spaniards\r\nretiring desolate, showing no longer that pride which they had been wont\r\nto wear on their faces,--looking constantly behind them, not so much from\r\nregret for what they were leaving as for fear lest the king’s vengeful\r\nsword should follow after them, and come to strike their death-blow.”\r\n [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. iv.  p. 370.]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards remained, however, in Milaness, ready to burst again upon\r\nthe Duke of Mantua.  The king was in a hurry to return to France in order\r\nto finish the subjugation of the Reformers in the south, commanded by the\r\nDuke of Rohan.  The cardinal placed little or no reliance upon the Duke\r\nof Savoy, whose “mind could get no rest, and going more swiftly than the\r\nrapid movements of the heavens, made every day more than twice the\r\ncircuit of the world, thinking how to set by the ears all kings, princes,\r\nand potentates, one with another, so that he alone might reap advantage\r\nfrom their divisions.  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. iv.  p. 375.]  A\r\nleague, however, was formed between France, the republic of Venice, the\r\nDuke of Mantua, and the Duke of Savoy, for the defence of Italy in case\r\nof fresh aggression on the part of the Spaniards; and the king, who had\r\njust concluded peace with England, took the road back to France.\r\nScarcely had the cardinal joined him before Privas when an imperialist\r\narmy advanced into the Grisons, and, supported by the celebrated Spanish\r\ngeneral Spinola, laid siege to Mantua.  Richelieu did not hesitate: he\r\nentered Piedmont in the month of March, 1630, to march before long on\r\nPignerol, an important place commanding the passage of the Alps; it, as\r\nwell as the citadel, was carried in a few days; the governor having asked\r\nfor time to “do his Easter” (take the sacrament), Marshal Crequi, who was\r\nafraid of seeing aid arrive from the Duke of Savoy, had all the clocks in\r\nthe town put on, to such purpose that the governor had departed and the\r\nplace was in the hands of the French when the re-enforcements came up.\r\nThe Duke of Savoy was furious, and had the soldiers who surrendered\r\nPignerol cut in pieces.\r\n\r\nThe king had put himself in motion to join his army.  “The French\r\nnoblesse,” said Spinola, “are very fortunate in seeing themselves honored\r\nby the presence of the king their master amongst their armies; I have\r\nnothing to regret in my life but never to have seen the like on the part\r\nof mine.”  This great general had resumed the siege of Casale when Louis\r\nXIII. entered Savoy; the inhabitants of Chambery opened their gates to\r\nhim; Annecy and Montmelian succumbed after a few days’ siege; Maurienne\r\nin its entirety made its submission, and the king fixed his quarters\r\nthere, whilst the cardinal pushed forward to Casale with the main body of\r\nthe army.  Rejoicings were still going on for a success gained before\r\nVeillane over the troops of the Duke of Savoy, when news arrived of the\r\ncapture of Mantua by the Imperialists.  This was the finishing blow to\r\nthe ambitious and restless spirit of the Duke of Savoy.  He saw Mantua in\r\nthe hands of the Spaniards, “who never give back aught of what falls into\r\ntheir power, whatever justice and the interests of alliance may make\r\nbinding on them;” it was all hope lost of an exchange which might have\r\ngiven him back Savoy; he took to his bed and died on the 26th of July,\r\n1630, telling his son that peace must be made on any terms whatever.\r\n“By just punishment of God, he who, during forty or fifty years of his\r\nreign, had constantly tried to set his neighbors a-blaze, died amidst the\r\nflames of his own dominions, which he had lost by his own obstinacy,\r\nagainst the advice of his friends and his allies.”\r\n\r\nThe King of France, in ill health, had just set out for Lyons; and\r\nthither the cardinal was soon summoned, for Louis XIII. appeared to be\r\ndying.  When he reached convalescence, the truce suspending hostilities\r\nsince the death of the Duke of Savoy was about to expire; Marshal\r\nSchomberg was preparing to march on the enemy, when there was brought\r\nto him a treaty, signed at Ratisbonne, between the emperor and the\r\nambassador of France, assisted by Francis du Tremblay, now known as\r\nFather Joseph, perhaps the only friend and certainly the most intimate\r\nconfidant of the cardinal, who always employed him on delicate or secret\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Richelieu and Father Joseph----280]\r\n\r\nBut Marshal Schomberg was fighting against Spain; he did not allow\r\nhimself to be stopped by a treaty concluded with the emperor, and\r\nspeedily found himself in front of Casale.  The two armies were already\r\nface to face, when there was seen coming out of the intrenchments an\r\nofficer in the pope’s service, who waved a white handkerchief; he came\r\nup to Marshal Schomberg, and was recognized as Captain Giulio Mazarini,\r\noften employed on the nuncio’s affairs; he brought word that the\r\nSpaniards would consent to leave the city, if, at the same time, the\r\nFrench would evacuate the citadel.  Spinola was no longer there to make a\r\ngood stand before the place; he had died a month previously, complaining\r\nloudly that his honor had been filched from him; and, determined not to\r\nyield up his last breath in a town which would have to be abandoned, he\r\nhad caused himself to be removed out of Casale, to go and die in a\r\nneighboring castle.\r\n\r\nCasale evacuated, the cardinal broke out violently against the\r\nnegotiators of Ratisbonne, saying that they had exceeded their powers,\r\nand declaring that the king regarded the treaty as null and void; there\r\nwas accordingly a recommencement of negotiations with the emperor as well\r\nas the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nIt was only in the month of September, 1631, that the states of Savoy and\r\nMantua were finally evacuated by the hostile troops.  Pignerol had been\r\ngiven up to the new Duke of Savoy, but a secret agreement had been\r\nentered into between that prince and France: French soldiers remained\r\nconcealed in Pignerol; and they retook possession of the place in the\r\nname of the king, who had purchased the town and its territory, to secure\r\nhimself a passage into Italy.  The Spaniards, when they bad news of it,\r\nmade so much the more uproar as they had the less foreseen it, and as it\r\ncut the thread of all the enterprises they were meditating against\r\nChristendom.  The affairs of the emperor in Germany were in too bad a\r\nstate for him to rekindle war, and France kept Pignerol.  The house of\r\nAustria, in fact, was threatened mortally.  For two years Cardinal\r\nRichelieu had been laboring to carry war into its very heart.  Ferdinand\r\nII. had displeased many electors of the empire, who began to be\r\ndisquieted at the advances made by his power.  “It is, no doubt, a great\r\naffliction for the Christian commonwealth,” said the cardinal to the\r\nGerman princes, “that none but the Protestants should dare to oppose such\r\npernicious designs; they must not be aided in their enterprises against\r\nreligion, but they must be made use of in order to maintain Germany in\r\nthe enjoyment of her liberties.”  The Catholic league in Germany,\r\nhabitually allied as it was with the house of Austria, did not offer any\r\nleader to take the field against her.  The King of Denmark, after a long\r\nperiod of hostilities, had just made peace with the emperor; and, “in\r\ntheir need, all these offended and despoiled princes looked, as sailors\r\nlook to the north,” towards the King of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gustavus Adolphus----282]\r\n\r\n“The King of Sweden was a new rising sun, who, having been at war with\r\nall his neighbors, had wrested from them several provinces; he was young,\r\nbut of great reputation, and already incensed against the emperor, not so\r\nmuch on account of any real injuries he had received from him as because\r\nhe was his neighbor.  His Majesty had kept an eye upon him with a view of\r\nattempting to make use of him in order to draw off, in course of time,\r\nthe main body of the emperor’s forces, and give him work to do in his own\r\ndominions.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_ t. v.  p. 119.]  Through\r\nRichelieu’s good offices, Gustavus Adolphus had just concluded a long\r\ntruce with the Poles, with whom he had been for some time at war: the\r\ncardinal’s envoy, M. de Charnace, at once made certain propositions to\r\nthe King of Sweden, promising the aid of France if he would take up the\r\ncause of the German princes; but Gustavus turned a cold ear to these\r\novertures, “not seeing in any quarter any great encouragement to\r\nundertake the war, either in England, peace with the Spaniards being\r\nthere as good as determined upon, or in Holland, for the same reason,\r\nor in the Hanseatic towns, which were all exhausted of wealth, or in\r\nDenmark, which had lost heart and was daily disarming, or in France,\r\nwhence he got not a word on which he could place certain reliance.”  The\r\nemperor, on his side, was seeking to make peace with Sweden, “and the\r\npeople of that country were not disinclined to listen to him.”\r\n\r\nGod, for the accomplishment of his will, sets at nought the designs and\r\nintentions of men.  Gustavus Adolphus was the instrument chosen by\r\nProvidence to finish the work of Henry IV. and Richelieu.  Negotiations\r\ncontinued to be carried on between the two parties, but, before his\r\nalliance with France was concluded, the King of Sweden, taking a sudden\r\nresolution, set out for Germany, on the 30th of May, 1630, with fifteen\r\nthousand men, “having told Charnace that he would not continue the war\r\nbeyond that year, if he did not agree upon terms of treaty with the king;\r\nso much does passion blind us,” adds the cardinal, “that he thought it to\r\nbe in his power to put an end to so great a war as that, just as it had\r\nbeen in his power to commence it.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Gustavus Adolphus was in Pomerania, the duke whereof,\r\nmaltreated by the emperor, admitted him on the 10th of July into Stettin,\r\nafter a show of resistance.  The Imperialists, in their fury, put to a\r\ncruel death all the inhabitants of the said city who happened to be in\r\ntheir hands, and gave up all its territory to fire and sword.  “The King\r\nof Sweden, on the contrary, had his army in such discipline, that it\r\nseemed as if every one of them were living at home, and not amongst\r\nstrangers; for in the actions of this king there was nothing to be seen\r\nbut inexorable severity towards the smallest excesses on the part of his\r\nmen, extraordinary gentleness towards the populations, and strict justice\r\non every occasion, all which conciliated the affections of all, and so\r\nmuch the more in that the emperor’s army, unruly, insolent, disobedient\r\nto its leaders, and full of outrage against the people, made their\r\nenemy’s virtues shine forth the brighter.”  [_Memoires de Richelieu,_\r\nt. vi.  p. 419.]\r\n\r\nGustavus Adolphus had left Sweden under the impulse of love for those\r\nglorious enterprises which make great generals, but still more of a\r\ndesire to maintain the Protestant cause, which he regarded as that of\r\nGod.  He had assembled the estates of Sweden in the castle of Stockholm,\r\npresenting to them his daughter Christina, four years old, whom he\r\nconfided to their faithful care.  “I have hopes,” he said to them, “of\r\nending by bringing triumph to the cause of the oppressed; but, as the\r\npitcher that goes often to the well gets broken, so I fear it may be my\r\nfate.  I who have exposed my life amidst so many dangers, who have so\r\noften spilt my blood for the country, without, thanks to God, having been\r\nwounded to death, must in the end make a sacrifice of myself; for that\r\nreason I bid you farewell, hoping to see you again in a better world.”\r\n He continued advancing into Germany.  “This snow king will go on melting\r\nas he comes south,” said the emperor, Ferdinand, on hearing that Gustavus\r\nAdolphus had disembarked; but Mecklenburg was already in his hands, and\r\nthe Elector of Brandenburg had just declared in his favor: he everywhere\r\nmade proclamation, “that the inhabitants were to come forward and join\r\nhim to take the part of their princes, whom he was coming to replace in\r\npossession.”  He was investing all parts of Austria, whose hereditary\r\ndominions he had not yet attacked; it was in the name of the empire that\r\nhe fought against the emperor.\r\n\r\nThe diet was terminating at Ratisbonne, and it had just struck a fatal\r\nblow at the imperial cause.  The electors, Catholic and Protestant,\r\njealous of the power as well as of the glory of the celebrated\r\nWallenstein, creator and commander-in-chief of the emperor’s army, who\r\nhad made him Duke of Friedland, and endowed him with the duchies of\r\nMecklenburg, had obliged Ferdinand II. to withdraw from him the command\r\nof the forces.  At this price he had hoped to obtain their votes to\r\ndesignate his son King of the Romans; the first step towards hereditary\r\nempire had failed, thanks to the ability of Father Joseph.  “This poor\r\nCapuchin has disarmed me with his chaplet,” said the emperor, “and for\r\nall that his cowl is so narrow he has managed to get six electoral hats\r\ninto it.”  The treaty he had concluded, disavowed by France, did not for\r\nan instant hinder the progress of the King of Sweden; and the cardinal\r\nlost no time in letting him know that “the king’s intention was in no\r\nwise to abandon him, but to assist him more than ever, insomuch as he\r\ndeemed it absolutely necessary in order to thwart the designs of those\r\nwho had no end in view but their own augmentation, to the prejudice of\r\nall the other princes of Europe.”  On the 25th of January, 1631, at\r\nBernwald, the treaty of alliance between France and Sweden was finally\r\nsigned.  Baron Charnace had inserted in the draft of the treaty the term\r\nprotection as between France and Gustavus Adolphus.  “Our master asks for\r\nno protection but that of Heaven, said the Swedish plenipotentiaries;\r\n“after God, his Majesty holds himself indebted only to his sword and his\r\nwisdom for any advantages he may gain.”  Charnace did not insist; and the\r\nvictories of Gustavus Adolphus were an answer to any difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe King of Sweden bound himself to furnish soldiers,--thirty thousand\r\nmen at the least; France was to pay, by way of subsidy, four hundred\r\nthousand crowns a year, and to give a hundred thousand crowns to cover\r\npast expenses.  Gustavus Adolphus promised to maintain the existing\r\nreligion in such countries as he might conquer, “though he said,\r\nlaughingly, that there was no possibility of promising about that, except\r\nin the fashion of him who sold the bear’s skin;” he likewise guaranteed\r\nneutrality to the princes of the Catholic league, provided that they\r\nobserved it towards him.  The treaty was made public at once, through the\r\nexertions of Gustavus Adolphus, though Cardinal Richelieu had charged\r\nCharnace to keep it secret for a time.\r\n\r\nTorquato Conti, one of the emperor’s generals, who had taken\r\nWallenstein’s place, wished to break off warfare during the long frosts.\r\n“My men do not recognize winter,” answered Gustavus Adolphus.  “This\r\nprince, who did not take to war as a pastime, but made it in order to\r\nconquer,” marched with giant strides across Germany, reducing everything\r\nas he went. He had arrived, by the end of April, before Frankfurt-on-the\r\nOder, which he took; and he was preparing to succor Magdeburg, which had\r\nearly pronounced for him, and which Tilly, the emperor’s general, kept\r\nbesieged.  The Elector of Saxony hesitated to take sides; he refused\r\nGustavus Adolphus a passage over the bridge of Dessau, on the Elbe.  On\r\nthe 20th of May Magdeburg fell, and Tilly gave over the place to the\r\nsoldiery; thirty thousand persons were massacred, and the houses\r\ncommitted to the flames.  “Nothing like it has been seen since the taking\r\nof Troy and of Jerusalem,” said Tilly in his savage joy.  The Protestant\r\nprinces, who had just been reconstituting the Evangelical Union, in the\r\ndiet they had held in February at Leipzig, revolted openly, ordering\r\nlevies of soldiers to protect their territories; the Catholic League,\r\nrenouncing neutrality, flew to arms on their side; the question became\r\nnothing less than that of restoring to the Protestants all that had been\r\ngranted them by the peace of Passau.  The soldiery of Tilly were already\r\nlet loose on electoral Saxony; the elector, constrained by necessity,\r\nintrusted his soldiers to Gustavus Adolphus, who had just received\r\nre-enforcements from Sweden, and the king marched against Tilly, still\r\nencamped before Leipzig, which he had forced to capitulate.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons gave way at the first shock of the imperial troops, but the\r\nKing of Sweden had dashed forward, and nothing could withstand him; Tilly\r\nhimself, hitherto proof against lead and steel, fell wounded in three\r\nplaces; five thousand dead were left on the field of battle; and Gustavus\r\nAdolphus dragged at his heels seven thousand prisoners.  “Never did the\r\ngrace of God pull me out of so bad a scrape,” said the conqueror.  He\r\nhalted some time at Mayence, which had just opened its gates to him.\r\nAxel Oxenstiern, his most faithful servant and oldest friend, whose\r\nintimacy with his royal master reminds one of that between Henry IV. and\r\nSully, came to join him in Germany; he had hitherto been commissioned to\r\nhold the government of the conquests won from the Poles.  He did not\r\napprove of the tactics of Gustavus Adolphus, who was attacking the\r\nCatholic League, and meanwhile leaving to the Elector of Saxony the\r\ncharge of carrying the war into the hereditary dominions of Austria.\r\n.  .  .  “Sir,” said he, “I should have liked to offer you my\r\nfelicitations on your victories, not at Mayence, but at Vienna.”  “If,\r\nafter the battle of Leipzig, the King of Sweden had gone straight to\r\nattack the emperor in his hereditary provinces, it had been all over with\r\nthe house of Austria,” says Cardinal Richelieu; “but either God did not\r\nwill the certain destruction of that house, which would perhaps have been\r\ntoo prejudicial to the Catholic religion, and he turned him aside from\r\nthe counsel which would have been more advantageous for him to take, or\r\nthe same God, who giveth not all to any, but distributeth his gifts\r\ndiversely to each, had given to this king, as to Hannibal, the knowledge\r\nhow to conquer, but not how to use victory.”\r\n\r\nGustavus Adolphus had resumed his course of success: he came up with\r\nTilly again on the Leek, April 10, 1632, and crushed his army; the\r\ngeneral was mortally wounded, and the King of Sweden, entering Augsburg\r\nin triumph, proclaimed religious liberty there.  He had moved forward in\r\nfront of Ingolstadt, and was making a reconnoissance in person.  “A king\r\nis not worthy of his crown who makes any difficulty about carrying it\r\nwherever a simple soldier can go,” he said.  A cannon-ball carried off\r\nthe hind quarters of his horse and threw him down.  He picked himself up,\r\nall covered with blood and mud.  “The fruit is not yet ripe,” he cried,\r\nwith that strange mixture of courage and fatalism which so often\r\ncharacterizes great warriors; and he marched to Munich, on which he\r\nimposed a heavy war-contribution.  The Elector of Bavaria, strongly\r\nfavored by France, sought to treat in the name of the Catholic League;\r\nbut Gustavus Adolphus required complete restitution of all territories\r\nwrested from the Protestant princes, the withdrawal of the troops\r\noccupying the dominions of the evangelicals, and the absolute neutrality\r\nof the Catholic princes.  “These conditions smacked rather of your\r\nvictorious prince, who would lay down and not accept the law.”  He\r\nsummoned to him all the inhabitants of the countries he traversed in\r\nconqueror’s style: _“Surgite d mortuis,”_ he said to the Bavarians, _“et\r\nvenite ad judieium” (Rise from the dead, and come to judgment)_.\r\nProtestant Suabia had declared for him, and Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar,\r\none of his ablest lieute ants, carried the Swedish arms to the very banks\r\nof the Lake of Constance.  The Lutheran countries of Upper Austria had\r\ntaken up arms; and Switzerland had permitted the King of Sweden to\r\nrecruit on her territory.  “Italy began to tremble,” says Cardinal\r\nRichelieu; “the Genevese themselves were fortifying their town, and, to\r\nsee them doing so, it seemed as if the King of Sweden were at their\r\ngates; but God had disposed it otherwise.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Ferdinand had recalled the only general capable of making a\r\nstand against Gustavus Adolphus.  Wallenstein, deeply offended, had for\r\na long while held out; but, being assured of the supreme command over the\r\nfresh army which Ferdinand was raising in all directions, he took the\r\nfield at the end of April, 1632.  Wallenstein effected a junction with\r\nthe Elector of Bavaria, forcing Gustavus Adolphus back, little by little,\r\non Nuremberg.  “I mean to show the King of Sweden a new way of making\r\nwar,” said the German general.  The sufferings of his army in an\r\nintrenched camp soon became intolerable to Gustavus Adolphus.  In spite\r\nof inferiority of forces, he attacked the enemy’s redoubts, and was\r\nrepulsed; the king revictualled Nuremberg, and fell back upon Bavaria.\r\nWallenstein at first followed him, and then flung himself upon Saxony,\r\nand took Leipzig; Gustavus Adolphus advanced to succor his ally, and the\r\ntwo armies met near the little town of Liitzen, on the 16th of November,\r\n1632.\r\n\r\nThere was a thick fog.  Gustavus Adolphus, rising before daybreak, would\r\nnot put on his breastplate, his old wounds hurting him under harness:\r\n“God is my breastplate,” he said.  When somebody came and asked him for\r\nthe watchword, he answered, “God with us;” and it was Luther’s hymn,\r\n_“Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott” (Our God is a strong tower),_ that the\r\nSwedes sang as they advanced towards the enemy.  The king had given\r\norders to march straight on Lutzen.  “He animated his men to the fight,”\r\n says Richelieu, “with words that he had at command, whilst Wallenstein,\r\nby his mere presence and the sternness of his silence, seemed to let his\r\nmen understand that, as he had been wont to do, he would reward them or\r\nchastise them, according as they did well or ill on that great day.”\r\n\r\nIt was ten A. M., and the fog had just lifted; six batteries of cannon\r\nand two large ditches defended the Imperialists; the artillery from the\r\nramparts of Liitzen played upon the king’s army, the balls came whizzing\r\nabout him; Bernard of Saxe-Weimar was the first to attack, pushing\r\nforward on Liitzen, which was soon taken; Gustavus Adolphus marched on to\r\nthe enemy’s intrenchments; for an instant the Swedish infantry seemed to\r\nwaver; the king seized a pike and flung himself amidst the ranks.  “After\r\ncrossing so many rivers, scaling so many walls, and storming so many\r\nplaces, if you have not courage enough to defend yourselves, at least\r\nturn your heads to see me die,” he shouted to the soldiers.  They\r\nrallied: the king remounted his horse, bearing along with him a regiment\r\nof Smalandaise cavalry.  “You will behave like good fellows, all of you,”\r\n he said to them, as he dashed over the two ditches, carrying, as he went,\r\ntwo batteries of the enemy’s cannon.  “He took off his hat and rendered\r\nthanks to God for the victory He was giving him.”\r\n\r\nTwo regiments of Imperial cuirassiers rode up to meet him; the king\r\ncharged them at the head of his Swedes; he was in the thickest of the\r\nfight; his horse received a ball through the neck; Gustavus had his arm\r\nbroken; the bone came through the sleeve of his coat; he wanted to have\r\nit attended to, and begged the Duke of Saxe-Altenburg to assist him in\r\nleaving the battle-field; at that very moment, Falkenberg, lieutenant-\r\ncolonel in the Imperial army, galloped his horse on to the king and shot\r\nhim, point-blank, in the back with a pistol.  The king fell from his\r\nhorse; and Falkenberg took to flight, pursued by one of the king’s\r\nsquires, who killed him.  Gustavus Adolphus was left alone with a German\r\npage, who tried to raise him; the king could no longer speak; three\r\nAustrian cuirassiers surrounded him, asking the page the name of the\r\nwounded man; the youngster would not say, and fell, riddled with wounds,\r\non his master’s body; the Austrians sent one more pistol-shot into the\r\ndying man’s temple, and stripped him of his clothes, leaving him only his\r\nshirt.  The melley recommenced, and successive charges of cavalry passed\r\nover the hero’s corpse; there were counted nine open wounds and thirteen\r\nscars on his body when it was recovered towards the evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Death of Gustavus and his Page----290]\r\n\r\nOne of the king’s officers, who had been unable to quit the fight in\r\ntime to succor him, went and announced his fall to Duke Bernard of\r\nSaxe-Weimar.  To him a retreat was suggested; but, “We mustn’t think of\r\nthat,” said he, “but of death or victory.”  A lieutenant-colonel of a\r\ncavalry regiment made some difficulty about resuming the attack: the duke\r\npassed his sword through his body, and, putting himself at the head of\r\nthe troops, led them back upon the enemy’s intrenchments which he carried\r\nand lost three times.  At last he succeeded in turning the cannon upon\r\nthe enemy, and “that gave the turn to the victory, which, nevertheless,\r\nwas disputed till night.”\r\n\r\n“It was one of the most horrible ever heard of,” says Cardinal Richelieu;\r\n“six thousand dead or dying were left on the field of battle, where Duke\r\nBernard encamped till morning.”\r\n\r\nWhen day came, he led the troops off to Weisenfeld.  The army knew\r\nnothing yet of the king’s death.  The Duke of Saxe-Weimar had the body\r\nbrought to the front.  “I will no longer conceal from you,” he said, “the\r\nmisfortune that has befallen us; in the name of the glory that you have\r\nwon in following this great prince, help me to exact vengeance for it,\r\nand to let all the world see that he commanded soldiers who rendered him\r\ninvincible, and, even after his death, the terror of his enemies.”  A\r\nshout arose from the host, “We will follow you whither you will, even to\r\nthe end of the earth.”\r\n\r\n“Those who look for spots on the sun, and find something reprehensible\r\neven in virtue itself, blame this king,” says Cardinal Richelieu,\r\n“for having died like a trooper; but they do not reflect that all\r\nconqueror-princes are obliged to do not only the duty of captain, but of\r\nsimple soldier, and to be the first in peril, in order to lead thereto\r\nthe soldier who would not run the risk without them.  It was the case\r\nwith Caesar and with Alexander, and the Swede died so much the more\r\ngloriously than either the one or the other, in that it is more becoming\r\nthe condition of a great captain and a conqueror to die sword in hand,\r\nmaking a tomb for his body of his enemies on the field of battle, than to\r\nbe hated of his own and poniarded by the hands of his nearest and\r\ndearest, or to die of poison or of drowning in a wine-butt.”\r\n\r\nJust like Napoleon in Egypt and Italy, Gustavus Adolphus, had performed\r\nthe prelude, by numerous wars against his neighbors, to the grand\r\nenterprise which was to render his name illustrious.  Vanquished in his\r\nstruggle with Denmark in 1613, he had carried war into Muscovy, conquered\r\ntowns and provinces, and as early as 1617 he had effected the removal of\r\nthe Russians from the shores of the Baltic.  The Poles made a pretence of\r\nsetting their own king, Sigismund, upon the throne of Sweden; and for\r\neighteen years Gustavus Adolphus had bravely defended his rights, and\r\nprotected and extended his kingdom up to the truce of Altenmarket,\r\nconcluded in 1629 through the intervention of Richelieu, who had need of\r\nthe young King of Sweden in order to oppose the Emperor Ferdinand and the\r\ndangerous power of the house of Austria.  Summoned to Germany by the\r\nProtestant princes who were being oppressed and despoiled, and assured of\r\nassistance and subsidies from the King of France, Gustavus Adolphus had,\r\nno doubt, ideas of a glorious destiny, which have been flippantly taxed\r\nwith egotistical ambition.  Perhaps, in the noble joy of victory, when he\r\n“was marching on without fighting,” seeing provinces submit, one after\r\nanother, without his being hardly at the pains to draw his sword, might\r\nhe have sometimes dreamed of a Protestant empire and the imperial crown\r\nupon his head; but, assuredly, such was not the aim of his enterprise and\r\nof his life.  “I must in the end make a sacrifice of myself,” he had said\r\non bidding farewell to the Estates of Sweden; and it was to the cause of\r\nProtestantism in Europe that he made this sacrifice.  Sincerely religious\r\nin heart, Gustavus Adolphus was not ignorant that his principal political\r\nstrength was in the hands of the Protestant princes; and he put at their\r\nservice the incomparable splendor of his military genius.  In two years\r\nthe power of the house of Austria, a work of so many efforts and so many\r\nyears, was shaken to its very foundations.  The evangelical union of\r\nProtestant princes was re-forming in Germany, and treating, as equal with\r\nequal, with the emperor; Ferdinand was trembling in Vienna, and the\r\nSpaniards, uneasy even in Italy, were collecting their forces to make\r\nhead against the irresistible conqueror, when the battle-field of Lutzen\r\nsaw the fall, at thirty years of age, of the “hero of the North, the\r\nbulwark of Protestantism,” as he was called by his contemporaries,\r\nastounded at his greatness.  God sometimes thus cuts off His noblest\r\nchampions in order to make men see that He is master, and He alone\r\naccomplishes His great designs; but to them whom He deigns to thus employ\r\nHe accords the glory of leaving their imprint upon the times they have\r\ngone through and the events to which they have contributed.  Two years of\r\nvictory in Germany at the head of Protestantism sufficed to make the name\r\nof Gustavus Adolphus illustrious forever.\r\n\r\nRichelieu had continued the work of Henry IV.; and Chancellor Oxenstiern\r\ndid not leave to perish that of his master and friend.  Scarcely was\r\nGustavus Adolphus dead when Oxenstiern convoked at Erfurt the deputies\r\nfrom the Protestant towns, and made them swear the maintenance of the\r\nunion.  He afterwards summoned to Heilbronn all the Protestant princes;\r\nthe four circles of Upper Germany (Franconia, Suabia, the Palatinate, and\r\nthe Upper Rhine), and the elector of Brandenburg alone sent their\r\nrepresentatives; but Richelieu had delegated M. de Feuquieres, who\r\nquietly brought his weight to bear on the decision of the assembly, and\r\ngot Oxenstiern appointed to direct the Protestant party; the Elector of\r\nSaxony, who laid claim to this honor, was already leaning towards the\r\ntreason which he was to consummate in the following year; France at the\r\nsame time renewed her treaty with Sweden and Holland; the great general\r\nof the armies of the empire, Wallenstein, displeased with his master, was\r\nmaking secret advances to the cardinal and to Oxenstiern; wherever he did\r\nnot appear in person the Imperial armies were beaten.  The emperor was\r\njust having his eyes opened, when Wallenstein, summoning around him at\r\nPilsen his generals and his lieutenants, made them take an oath of\r\nconfederacy for the defence of his person and of the army, and, begging\r\nBernard of Saxe-Weimar and the Saxon generals to join him in Bohemia, he\r\nwrote to Feuquieres to accept the king’s secret offers.\r\n\r\nAmongst the generals assembled at Pilsen there happened to be Max\r\nPiccolomini, in whom Wallenstein had great confidence: he at once\r\nrevealed to the emperor his generalissimo’s guilty intrigues.\r\nWallenstein fell, assassinated by three of his officers, on the 15th of\r\nFebruary, 1634; and the young King of Hungary, the emperor’s eldest son,\r\ntook the command-in chief of the army under the direction of the veteran\r\ngenerals of the empire.  On the 6th of September, by one of those\r\nreversals which disconcert all human foresight, Bernard of Saxe-Weimar\r\nand the Swedish marshal, Horn, coming up to the aid of Nordlingen, which\r\nwas being besieged by the Austrian army, were completely beaten in front\r\nof that place; and their army retired in disorder, leaving Suabia to the\r\nconqueror.  Protestant Germany was in consternation; all eyes were turned\r\ntowards France.\r\n\r\nCardinal Richelieu was ready; the frequent treasons of Duke Charles of\r\nLorraine had recently furnished him with an opportunity, whilst directing\r\nthe king’s arms against him, of taking possession, partly by negotiation\r\nand partly by force, first of the town of Nancy, and then of the duchy of\r\nBar; the duke had abdicated in favor of the cardinal, his brother, who,\r\nrenouncing his ecclesiastical dignity, espoused his cousin, Princess\r\nClaude of Lorraine, and took refuge with her at Florence, whilst Charles\r\nled into Germany, to the emperor, all the forces he had remaining.  The\r\nking’s armies were coming to provisionally take possession of all the\r\nplaces in Lothringen, where the Swedes, beaten in front of Nordlingen,\r\nbeing obliged to abandon the left bank of the Upper Rhine, placed in the\r\nhands of the French the town of Philipsburg, which they had but lately\r\ntaken from the Spaniards.  The Rhinegrave Otto, who was commanding in\r\nElsass for the confederates, in the same way effected his retreat,\r\ndelivering over to Marshal La Force Colmar, Schlestadt, and many small\r\nplaces; the Bishop of Basle and the free city of Mulhausen likewise\r\nclaimed French protection.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of November, the ambassadors of Sweden and of the Protestant\r\nLeague signed at Paris a treaty of alliance, soon afterwards ratified by\r\nthe diet at Worms, and the French army, entering Germany, under Marshals\r\nLa Force and Breze, caused the siege of Heidelberg to be raised on the\r\n23d of December.  Richelieu was in treaty at the same time with the\r\nUnited Provinces for the invasion of the Catholic Low Countries.  It was\r\nin the name of their ancient liberties that the cardinal, in alliance\r\nwith the heretics of Holland, summoned the ancient Flanders to revolt\r\nagainst Spain; if they refused to listen to this appeal, the confederates\r\nwere under mutual promises to divide their conquest between them.  France\r\nconfined herself to stipulating for the maintenance of the Catholic\r\nreligion in the territory that devolved to Holland.  The army destined\r\nfor this enterprise was already in preparation, and the king was setting\r\nout to visit it, when, in April, 1635, he was informed of Chancellor\r\nOxenstiern’s arrival.  Louis XIII. awaited him at Compiegne.  The\r\nchancellor was accompanied by a numerous following, worthy of the man who\r\nheld the command of a sovereign over the princes of the Protestant\r\nLeague; he had at his side the famous Hugo Grotius, but lately exiled\r\nfrom his country on account of religious disputes, and now accredited as\r\nambassador to the King of France from the little queen, Christina of\r\nSweden.  It was Grotius who acted as interpreter between the king and the\r\nchancellor of Sweden.  A rare and grand spectacle was this interview\r\nbetween, on the one side, the Swede and the Hollander, both of them great\r\npolitical philosophers in theory or practice, and, on the other, the\r\nall-powerful minister of the King of France, in presence of that king\r\nhimself.  When Oxenstiern and Richelieu conferred alone together, the two\r\nministers had recourse to Latin, that common tongue of the cultivated\r\nminds of their time, and nobody was present at their conversation.\r\nOxenstiern soon departed for Holland, laden with attentions and presents:\r\nhe carried away with him a new treaty of alliance between Sweden and\r\nFrance, and the assurance that the king was about to declare war against\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nAnd it broke out, accordingly, on the 19th of May, 1635.  The violation\r\nof the electorate of Treves by the Cardinal Infante, and the carrying-off\r\nof the elector-archbishop served as pretext; and Louis XIII. declared\r\nhimself protector of a feeble prince who had placed in his hands the\r\ncustody of several places.  Alencon, herald-at-arms of France, appeared\r\nat Brussels, proclamation of war in hand; and, not be able to obtain an\r\ninterview with the Cardinal Infante, he hurled it at the feet of the\r\nBelgian herald-at-arms commissioned to receive him, and he affixed a copy\r\nof it to a post he set up in the ground in the last Flemish village, near\r\nthe frontier.  On the 6th of June, a proclamation of the king’s summoned\r\nthe Spanish Low Countries to revolt.  A victory had already been gained\r\nin Luxembourg, close to the little town of Avein, over Prince Thomas of\r\nSavoy, the duke-regnant’s brother, who was embroiled with him, and whom\r\nSpain had just taken into her service.  The campaign of 1635 appeared to\r\nbe commencing under happy auspices.  These hopes were deceived; the Low\r\nCountries did not respond to the summons of the king and of his\r\nconfederates; there was no rising anywhere against the Spanish yoke;\r\ntraditional jealousy of the heretics of Holland prevented the Flanders\r\nfrom declaring for France; it was necessary to undertake a conquest\r\ninstead of fomenting an insurrection.  The Prince of Orange was advancing\r\nslowly into Germany; the Elector of Saxony had treated with the emperor,\r\nand several towns were accepting the peace concluded between them at\r\nPrague; Bernard of Saxe-Weimar, supported by Cardinal Valette, at the\r\nhead of French troops, had been forced to fall back to Metz in order to\r\nprotect Lothringen and Elsass.  In order to attach this great general to\r\nhimself forever, the king had just ceded to Duke Bernard the landgravate\r\nof Elsass, hereditary possession, as it was, of the house of Austria.\r\nThe Prince of Conde was attacking Franche-Comte; the siege of Dole was\r\ndragging its slow length along, when the emperor’s most celebrated\r\nlieutenants, John van Weert and Piccolomini, who had formed a junction in\r\nBelgium, all at once rallied the troops of Prince Thomas, and, advancing\r\nrapidly towards Picardy, invaded French soil at the commencement of July,\r\n1636.  La Capelle and Le Catelet were taken by assault, and the\r\nImperialists laid siege to Corbie, a little town on the Somme four\r\nleagues from Amiens.\r\n\r\nGreat was the terror at Paris, and, besides the terror, the rage; the\r\ncardinal was accused of having brought ruin upon France; for a moment the\r\nexcitement against him was so violent that his friends were disquieted by\r\nit: he alone was unmoved.  The king quitted St. Germain and returned to\r\nParis, whilst Richelieu, alone, without escort, and with his horses at a\r\nwalk, had himself driven to the Hotel de Ville right through the mob in\r\ntheir fury.  “Then was seen,” says Fontenay-Mareuil, “what can be done by\r\na great heart (vertu), and how it is revered even of the basest souls,\r\nfor the streets were so full of folks that there was hardly room to pass,\r\nand all so excited that they spoke of nothing but killing him: as soon as\r\nthey saw him approaching, they all held their peace or prayed God to give\r\nhim good speed, that he might be able to remedy the evil which was\r\napprehended.”\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of August, Corbie surrendered to the Spaniards, who crossed\r\nthe Somme, wasting the country behind them; but already alarm had given\r\nplace to ardent desire for vengeance; the cardinal had thought of\r\neverything and provided for everything: the bodies corporate, from the\r\nParliament to the trade-syndicates, had offered the king considerable\r\nsums; all the gentlemen and soldiers unemployed had been put on the\r\nactive list of the army; and the burgesses of Paris, mounting in throngs\r\nthe steps of the Hotel de Ville, went and shook hands with the veteran\r\nMarshal La Force, saying, “Marshal, we want to make war with you.”  They\r\nwere ordered to form the nucleus of the reserve army which was to protect\r\nParis.  The Duke of Orleans took the command of the army assembled at\r\nCompiegne, at the head of which the Count of Soissons already was; the\r\ntwo princes advanced slowly; they halted two days to recover the little\r\nfortress of Roze; the Imperialists fell back; they retired into Artois;\r\nthey were not followed, and the French army encamped before Corbie.\r\n\r\nWinter was approaching; nobody dared to attack the town; the cardinal had\r\nno confidence in either the Duke of Orleans or the Count of Soissons.  He\r\nwent to Amiens, whilst the king established his headquarters at the\r\ncastle of Demuin, closer to Corbie.  Richelieu determined to attack the\r\ntown by assault; the trenches were opened on the 5th of November; on the\r\n10th the garrison parleyed; on the 14th the place was surrendered.  “I am\r\nvery pleased to send you word that we have recovered Corbie,” wrote\r\nVoiture to one of his friends, very hostile to the cardinal [_OEuvres de\r\nVoiture,_ p. 175]: “the news will astonish you, no doubt, as well as all\r\nEurope; nevertheless, we are masters of it.  Reflect, I beg you, what has\r\nbeen the end of this expedition which has made so much noise.  Spain and\r\nGermany had made for the purpose their supremest efforts.  The emperor\r\nhad sent his best captains and his best cavalry.  The army of Flanders\r\nhad given its best troops.  Out of that is formed an army of twenty-five\r\nthousand horse, fifteen thousand foot, and forty cannon.  This cloud, big\r\nwith thunder and lightning, comes bursting over Picardy, which it finds\r\nunsheltered, our arms being occupied elsewhere.  They take, first of all,\r\nLa Capelle and Le Catelet; they attack, and in nine days take, Corbie;\r\nand so they are masters of the river; they cross it, and they lay waste\r\nall that lies between the Somme and the Oise.  And so long as there is no\r\nresistance, they valiantly hold the country, they slay our peasants and\r\nburn our villages; but, at the first rumor that reaches them to the\r\neffect that Monsieur is advancing with an army, and that the king is\r\nfollowing close behind him, they intrench themselves behind Corbie; and,\r\nwhen they learn that there is no halting, and that the march against them\r\nis going on merrily, our conquerors abandon their intrenchments.  And\r\nthese determined gentry, who were to pierce France even to the Pyrenees,\r\nwho threatened to pillage Paris, and recover there, even in Notre-Dame,\r\nthe flags of the battle of Avein, permit us to effect the circumvallation\r\nof a place which is of so much importance to them, give us leisure to\r\nconstruct forts, and, after that, let us attack and take it by assault\r\nbefore their very eyes.  Such is the end of the bravadoes of Piccolomini,\r\nwho sent us word by his trumpeters to say, at one time, that he wished we\r\nhad some powder, and, at another, that we had some cavalry coming, and,\r\nwhen we had both one and the other, he took very good care to wait for\r\nus.  In such sort, sir, that, except La Capelle and Le Catelet, which are\r\nof no consideration, all the flash made by this grand and victorious army\r\nhas been the capture of Corbie, only to give it up again and replace it\r\nin the king’s hands, together with a counterscarp, three bastions, and\r\nthree demilunes, which it did not possess.  If they had taken ten more of\r\nour places with similar success, our frontier would be in all the better\r\ncondition for it, and they would have fortified it better than those who\r\nhitherto have had the charge of it.  .  .  .  Was it not said that we\r\nshould expend before this place many millions of gold and many millions\r\nof men with a chance of taking it, perhaps, in three years?  Yet, when\r\nthe resolution was taken to attack it by assault, the month of November\r\nbeing well advanced, there was not a soul but cried out.  The best\r\nintentioned avowed that it showed blindness, and the rest said that we\r\nmust be afraid lest our soldiers should not die soon enough of misery and\r\nhunger, and must wish to drown them in their own trenches.  As for me,\r\nthough I knew the inconveniencies which necessarily attend sieges\r\nundertaken at this season, I suspended my judgment; for, sooth to say, we\r\nhave often seen the cardinal out in matters that he has had done by\r\nothers, but we have never yet seen him fail in enterprises that he has\r\nbeen pleased to carry out in person and that he has supported by his\r\npresence.  I believed, then, that he would surmount all difficulties; and\r\nthat he who had taken La Rochelle in spite of Ocean, would certainly take\r\nCorbie too in spite of Winter’s rains.  .  .  .  You will tell me, that\r\nit is luck which has made him take fortresses without ever having\r\nconducted a siege before, which has made him, without any experience,\r\ncommand armies successfully, which has always led him, as it were, by the\r\nhand, and preserved him amidst precipices into which he had thrown\r\nhimself, and which, in fact, has often made him appear bold, wise, and\r\nfar-sighted: let us look at him, then, in misfortune, and see if he had\r\nless boldness, wisdom, and far sightedness.  Affairs were not going over\r\nwell in Italy, and we had met with scarcely more success before Dole.\r\nWhen it was known that the enemy had entered Picardy, that all is a-flame\r\nto the very banks of the Oise, everybody takes fright, and the chief city\r\nof the realm is in consternation.  On top of that come advices from\r\nBurgundy that the siege of Dole is raised, and from Saintonge that there\r\nare fifteen thousand peasants revolted, and that there is fear lest\r\nPoitou and Guienne may follow this example.  Bad news comes thickly, the\r\nsky is overcast on all sides, the tempest beats upon us in all\r\ndirections, and from no quarter whatever does a single ray of good\r\nfortune shine upon us.  Amidst all this darkness, did the cardinal see\r\nless clearly?  Did he lose his head during all this tempest?  Did he not\r\nstill hold the helm in one hand, and the compass in the other?  Did he\r\nthrow himself into the boat to save his life?  Nay, if the great ship he\r\ncommanded were to be lost, did he not show that he was ready to die\r\nbefore all the rest?  Was it luck that drew him out of this labyrinth,\r\nor was it his own prudence, steadiness, and magnanimity?  Our enemies are\r\nfifteen leagues from Paris, and his are inside it.  Every day come\r\nadvices that they are intriguing there to ruin him.  France and Spain,\r\nso to speak, have conspired against him alone.  What countenance was kept\r\namidst all this by the man who they said would be dumbfounded at the\r\nleast ill-success, and who had caused Le Havre to be fortified in order\r\nto throw himself into it at the first misfortune?  He did not make a\r\nsingle step backward all the same.  He thought of the perils of the\r\nstate, and not of his own; and the only change observed in him all\r\nthrough was that, whereas he had not been wont to go out but with an\r\nescort of two hundred guards, he walked about, every day, attended by\r\nmerely five or six gentlemen.  It must be owned that adversity borne with\r\nso good a grace and such force of character is worth more than a great\r\ndeal of prosperity and victory.  To me he did not seem so great and so\r\nvictorious on the day he entered La Rochelle as then; and the journeys he\r\nmade from his house to the arsenal seem to me more glorious for him than\r\nthose which he made beyond the mountains, and from which he returned with\r\nthe triumphs of Pignerol and Suza.”\r\n\r\nThis was Cardinal Richelieu’s distinction, that all his contemporaries,\r\nin the same way as Voiture, identified the mishaps and the successes of\r\ntheir country with his own fortunes, and that upon him alone were fixed\r\nthe eyes of Europe, whether friendly or hostile, when it supported or\r\nwhen it fought against France.\r\n\r\nFor four years the war was carried on with desperation by land and sea in\r\nthe Low Countries, in Germany, and in Italy, with alternations of success\r\nand reverse.  The actors disappeared one after another from the scene;\r\nthe emperor, Ferdinand II., had died on the 15th of February, 1637;--the\r\nelection of his son, Ferdinand III., had not been recognized by France\r\nand Sweden; Bernard of Saxe-Weimar succumbed, at thirty-four years of\r\nage, on the 15th of July, 1639, after having beaten, in the preceding\r\nyear, the celebrated John van Weert, whom he sent a prisoner to Paris.\r\nAt his death the landgravate of Elsass reverted to France, together with\r\nthe town of Brisach, which he had won from the Imperialists.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Savoy had died in 1637; his widow, Christine of France,\r\ndaughter of Henry IV., was, so far as her brother’s cause in Italy was\r\nconcerned, but a poor support; but Count d’Harcourt, having succeeded, as\r\nhead of the army, Cardinal Valette, who died in 1638, had retaken Turin\r\nand Casale from the Imperialists in the campaign of 1640; two years\r\nlater, in the month of June, 1642, the Princes Thomas and Maurice,\r\nbrothers-in-law of the Duchess Christine, wearied out by the maladdress\r\nand haughtiness of the Spaniards, attached themselves definitively to the\r\ninterests of France, drove out the Spanish garrisons from Nice and Ivrea,\r\nin concert with the Duke of Longueville, and retook the fortress of\r\nTortona as well as all Milaness to the south of the Po.  Perpignan,\r\nbesieged for more than two years past by the king’s armies, capitulated\r\nat the same moment.  Spain, hard pressed at home by the insurrection of\r\nthe Catalans and the revolt of Portugal at the same time, both supported\r\nby Richelieu, saw Arras fall into the hands of France (August 9, 1640),\r\nand the plot contrived with the Duke of Bouillon and the Count of\r\nSoissons fail at the battle of La Marfee, where this latter prince was\r\nkilled on the 16th of July, 1641.  In Germany, Marshal Guebriant and the\r\nSwedish general Torstenson, so paralyzed that he had himself carried in a\r\nlitter to the head of his army, had just won back from the empire\r\nSilesia, Moravia, and nearly all Saxony; the chances of war were\r\neverywhere favorable to France, a just recompense for the indomitable\r\nperseverance of Cardinal Richelieu through good and evil fortune.  “The\r\ngreat tree of the house of Austria was shaken to its very roots, and he\r\nhad all but felled that trunk which with its two branches covers the\r\nNorth and the West, and throws a shadow over the rest of the earth.”\r\n [_Lettres de Malherbe,_ t. iv.]  The king, for a moment shaken in his\r\nfidelity towards his minister by the intrigues of Cinq-Mars, had returned\r\nto the cardinal with all the impetus of the indignation caused by the\r\nguilty treaty made by his favorite with Spain.  All Europe thought as the\r\nyoung captain in the guards, afterwards Marshal Fabert, who, when the\r\nking said to him, “I know that my army is divided into two factions,\r\nroyalists and cardinalists; which are you for?” answered, “Cardinalists,\r\nsir, for the cardinal’s party is yours.”  The cardinal and France were\r\ntriumphing together, but the conqueror was dying; Cardinal Richelieu had\r\njust been removed from Ruel to Paris.\r\n\r\nFor several months past, the cardinal’s health, always precarious, had\r\ntaken a serious turn; it was from his sick-bed that he, a prey to cruel\r\nagonies, directed the movements of the army, and, at the same time, the\r\nprosecution of Cinq-Mars.  All at once his chest was attacked; and the\r\ncardinal felt that he was dying.  On the 2d of December, 1642, public\r\nprayers were ordered in all the churches; the king went from St. Germain\r\nto see his minister.  The cardinal was quite prepared.  “I have this\r\nsatisfaction,” he said, “that I have never deserted the king, and that I\r\nleave his kingdom exalted, and all his enemies abased.”  He commended his\r\nrelatives to his Majesty, “who on their behalf will remember my\r\nservices;” then, naming the two secretaries of state, Chavigny and De\r\nNoyers, he added, “Your Majesty has Cardinal Mazarin; I believe him to be\r\ncapable of serving the king.”  And he handed to Louis XIII. a\r\nproclamation which he had just prepared for the purpose of excluding\r\nthe Duke of Orleans from any right to the regency in case of the king’s\r\ndeath.  The preamble called to mind that the king had five times already\r\npardoned his brother, recently engaged in a new plot against him.\r\n\r\nThe king had left the cardinal, but without returning to St. Germain.  He\r\nremained at the Louvre.  Richelieu had in vain questioned the physicians\r\nas to how long he had to live.  One, only, dared to go beyond commonplace\r\nhopes.  “Monsignor,” he said, “in twenty-four hours you will be dead or\r\ncured.”  “That is the way to speak!” said the cardinal; and he sent for\r\nthe priest of St. Eustache, his parish.  As they were bringing into his\r\nchamber the Holy Eucharist, he stretched out his hand, and, “There,” said\r\nhe, “is my Judge before whom I shall soon appear; I pray him with all my\r\nheart to condemn me if I have ever had any other aim than the welfare of\r\nreligion and of the state.”  The priest would have omitted certain\r\ncustomary questions, but, “Treat me as the commonest of Christians,” said\r\nthe cardinal.  And when he was asked to pardon his enemies, “I never had\r\nany but those of the state,” answered the dying man.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal’s family surrounded his bed; and the attendance was\r\nnumerous.  The Bishop of Lisieux, Cospdan, a man of small wits, but of\r\nsincere devoutness, listened attentively to the firm speech, the calm\r\ndeclarations, of the expiring minister.  “So much self-confidence appalls\r\nme,” he said below his breath.  Richelieu died as he had lived, without\r\nscruples and without delicacies of conscience, absorbed by his great aim,\r\nand but little concerned about the means he had employed to arrive at it.\r\n“I believe, absolutely, all the truths taught by the church,” he had said\r\nto his confessor, and this faith sufficed for his repose.  The memory of\r\nthe scaffolds he had caused to be erected did not so much as recur to his\r\nmind.  “I have loved justice, and not vengeance.  I have been severe\r\ntowards some in order to be kind towards all,” he had said in his will,\r\nwritten in Latin.  He thought just the same on his death-bed.\r\n\r\nThe king left him, not without emotion and regret.  The cardinal begged\r\nMadame d’Aiguillon, his niece, to withdraw.  “She is the one whom I have\r\nloved most,” he said.  Those around him were convulsed with weeping.  A\r\nCarmelite whom he had sent for turned to those present, and, “Let those,”\r\n he said, “who cannot refrain from showing the excess of their weeping and\r\ntheir lamentation leave the room; let us pray for this soul.”  In\r\npresence of the majesty of death and eternity human grandeur disappears\r\nirrevocably; the all-powerful minister was at that moment only this soul.\r\nA last gasp announced his departure; Cardinal Richelieu was dead.\r\n\r\nHe was dead, but his work survived him.  On the very evening of the 3d of\r\nDecember, Louis XIII. called to his council Cardinal Mazarin; and next\r\nday he wrote to the Parliaments and governors of provinces, “God having\r\nbeen pleased to take to himself the Cardinal de Richelieu, I have\r\nresolved to preserve and keep up all establishments ordained during his\r\nministry, to follow out all projects arranged with him for affairs abroad\r\nand at home, in such sort that there shall not be any change.  I have\r\ncontinued in my councils the same persons as served me then, and I have\r\ncalled thereto Cardinal Mazarin, of whose capacity and devotion to my\r\nservice I have had proof, and of whom I feel no less sure than if he had\r\nbeen born amongst my subjects.”  Scarcely had the most powerful kings\r\nyielded up their last breath, when their wishes had been at once\r\nforgotten: Cardinal Richelieu still governed in his grave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Palais-Cardinal----305]\r\n\r\nThe king had distributed amongst his minister’s relatives the offices and\r\ndignities which he had left vacant; the fortune that came to them was\r\nenormous; the legacies left to mere domestics amounted to more than three\r\nhundred thousand-livres.  During his lifetime Richelieu had given to the\r\ncrown “my grand hotel, which I built, and called Palais-de-Cardinal, my\r\nchapel (or chapel-service) of gold, enriched with diamonds, my grand\r\nbuffet of chased silver, and a large diamond that I bought of Lopez.”  In\r\nhis will he adds, “I most humbly beseech his Majesty to think proper to\r\nhave placed in his hands, out of the coined gold and silver that I have\r\nat my decease, the sum of fifteen hundred thousand livres, of which sum\r\nI can truly say that I made very good use for the great affairs of his\r\nkingdom, in such sort, that if I had not had this money at my disposal,\r\ncertain matters which have turned out well would have, to all\r\nappearances, turned out ill; which gives me ground for daring to beseech\r\nhis Majesty to destine this sum, that I leave him, to be employed on\r\ndivers occasions which cannot abide the tardiness of financial forms.”\r\n\r\nThe minister and priest who had destroyed the power of the grandees in\r\nFrance had, nevertheless, the true instinct respecting the perpetuation\r\nof families.  “Inasmuch as it hath pleased God,” he says in his will,\r\n“to bless my labors, and make them considered by the king, my kind\r\nmaster, showing recognition of them by his royal munificence, beyond what\r\nI could hope for, I have esteemed it a duty to bind my heirs to preserve\r\nthe estate in my family, in such sort that it may maintain itself for a\r\nlong while in the dignity and splendor which it hath pleased the king to\r\nconfer upon it, in order that posterity may know that, as I served him\r\nfaithfully, he, by virtue of a complete kingliness, knew what love to\r\nshow me, and how to load me with his benefits.”\r\n\r\nThe cardinal had taken pleasure in embellishing the estate of Richelieu,\r\nin Touraine, where he was born, and which the king had raised to a\r\nduchy-peerage.  Mdlle. de Montpensier, in her _Memoires,_ gives an\r\naccount of a visit she paid to it in her youth.  “I passed,” she says,\r\n“along a very fine street of the town, all the houses of which are in the\r\nbest style of building, one like another, and quite newly made, which is\r\nnot to be wondered at.  MM. de Richelieu, though gentlemen of good\r\nstanding, had never built a town; they had been content with their\r\nvillage and with a mediocre house.  At the present time it is the most\r\nbeautiful and most magnificent castle you could possibly see, and all the\r\nornament that could be given to a house is found there.  This will not be\r\ndifficult to believe if one considers that it is the work of the most\r\nambitious and most ostentatious man in the world, premier minister of\r\nstate too, who for a long while possessed absolute authority over\r\naffairs.  It is, nevertheless, inconceivable that the apartments should\r\ncorrespond so ill in size with the beauty of the outside.  I hear that\r\nthis arose from the fact that the cardinal wished to have the chamber\r\npreserved in which he was born.  To adjust the house of a simple\r\ngentleman to the grand ideas of the most powerful favorite there has ever\r\nbeen in France, you will observe that the architect must have been\r\nhampered; accordingly he did not see his way to planning any but very\r\nsmall quarters, which, by way of recompense, as regards gilding or\r\npainting, lack no embellishment inside.\r\n\r\n“Amidst all that modern invention has employed to embellish it, there are\r\nto be seen, on the chimney-piece in a drawingroom, the arms of Cardinal\r\nRichelieu, just as they were during the lifetime of his father, which the\r\ncardinal desired to leave there, because they comprise a collar of the\r\nHoly Ghost, in order to prove to those who are wont to misrepresent the\r\norigin of favorites that he was born a gentleman of a good house.  In\r\nthis point, he imposed upon nobody.”\r\n\r\nThe castle of Richelieu is well nigh destroyed; his family, after falling\r\ninto poverty, is extinct; the Palais-Cardinal has assumed the name of\r\nPalais-Royal; and pure monarchy, the aim of all his efforts and the work\r\nof his whole life, has been swept away by the blast of revolution.  Of\r\nthe cardinal there remains nothing but the great memory of his power and\r\nof the services he rendered his country.  Evil has been spoken, with good\r\nreason, of glory; it lasts, however, more durably than material successes\r\neven when they rest on the best security.  Richelieu had no conception of\r\nthat noblest ambition on which a human soul can feed, that of governing a\r\nfree country, but he was one of the greatest, the most effective, and the\r\nboldest, as well as the most prudent servants that France ever had.\r\n\r\nCardinal Richelieu gave his age, whether admirers or adversaries, the\r\nidea which Malherbe expressed in a letter to one of his friends: “You\r\nknow that my humor is neither to flatter nor to lie; but I swear to you\r\nthat there is in this man a something which surpasses humanity, and that\r\nif our bark is ever to outride the tempests, it will be whilst this\r\nglorious hand holds the rudder.  Other pilots diminish my fear, this one\r\nmakes me unconscious of it.  Hitherto, when we had to build anew or\r\nrepair some ruin, plaster alone was put in requisition.  Now we see\r\nnothing but marble used; and, whilst the counsels are judicious and\r\nfaithful, the execution is diligent and magnanimous.  Wits, judgment, and\r\ncourage never existed in any man to the degree that they do in him.  As\r\nfor interest, he knows none but that of the public.  To that he clings\r\nwith a passion so unbridled, if I may dare so to speak, that the visible\r\ninjury it does his constitution is not capable of detaching him from it.\r\nSees he anything useful to the king’s service, he goes at it without\r\nlooking to one side or the other.  Obstacles tempt him, resistance piques\r\nhim, and nothing that is put in his way diverts him; the disregard he\r\nshows of self, and of all that touches himself, as if he knew no sort of\r\nhealth or disease but the health or disease of the state, causes all good\r\nmen to fear that his life will not be long enough for him to see the\r\nfruit of what he plants; and moreover, it is quite evident that what he\r\nleaves undone can never be completed by any man that holds his place.\r\nWhy, man, he does a thing because it has to be done!  The space between\r\nthe Rhine and the Pyrenees seems to him not field enough for the lilies\r\nof France.  He would have them occupy the two shores of the\r\nMediterranean, and waft their odors thence to the extremest countries of\r\nthe Orient.  Measure by the extent of his designs the extent of his\r\ncourage.”  [Letters to Racan and to M. de Mentin. _OEuvres de Malherbe,_\r\nt. iv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Tomb of Richelieu----308]\r\n\r\nThe cardinal had been barely four months reposing in that chapel of the\r\nSorbonne which he had himself repaired for the purpose, and already King\r\nLouis XIII. was sinking into the tomb.  The minister had died at\r\nfifty-seven, the king was not yet forty-two; but his always languishing\r\nhealth seemed unable to bear the burden of affairs which had been but\r\nlately borne by Richelieu alone.  The king had permitted his brother to\r\nappear again at court.  “Monsieur supped with me,” says Mdlle. de\r\nMontpensier, “and we had the twenty-four violins; he was as gay as if\r\nMM. Cinq-Mars and De Thou had not tarried by the way.  I confess that I\r\ncould not see him without thinking of them, and that in my joy I felt\r\nthat his gave me a pang.”  The prisoners and exiles, by degrees,\r\nreceived their pardon; the Duke of Vendome, Bassompierre, and Marshal\r\nVitry had been empowered to return to their castles, the Duchess of\r\nChevreuse and the ex-keeper of the seals, Chateauneuf, were alone\r\nexcepted from this favor.  “After the peace,” said the declaration\r\ntouching the regency, which the king got enregistered by the Parliament\r\non the 23d of April.  The little dauphin, who had merely been sprinkled,\r\nhad just received baptism in the chapel of the Castle of St. Germain.\r\nThe king asked him, next day, if he knew what his name was.  “My name is\r\nLouis XIV.,” answered the child.  “Not yet, my son, not yet,” said the\r\nking, softly.\r\n\r\nLouis XIII. did not cling to life: it had been sad and burdensome to him\r\nby the mere fact of his own melancholy and singular character, not that\r\nGod had denied him prosperity or success.  He had the windows opened of\r\nhis chamber in the new castle of St. Germain looking towards the Abbey of\r\nSt. Denis, where he had, at last, just laid the body of the queen his\r\nmother, hitherto resting at Cologne.  “Let me see my last resting-place,”\r\n he said to his servants.  The crowd of courtiers thronged to the old\r\ncastle, inhabited by the queen; visits were made to the new castle to see\r\nthe king, who still worked with his ministers; when he was alone, “he was\r\nseen nearly always with his eyes open towards heaven, as if he talked\r\nwith God heart to heart.”  [_Memoires sur la Mort de Louis XIII.,_ by his\r\nvalet-de-chambre Dubois; _Archives curieuses,_ t. v.  p. 428.]  On the\r\n23d of April, it was believed that the last moment had arrived: the king\r\nreceived extreme unction; a dispute arose about the government of\r\nBrittany, given by the king to the Duke of La Meilleraye and claimed by\r\nthe Duke of Vendome; the two claimants summoned their friends; the queen\r\ntook fright, and, being obliged to repair to the king, committed the\r\nimprudence of confiding her children to the Duke of Beaufort, Vendome’s\r\neldest son, a young scatter-brain who made a great noise about this\r\nfavor.  The king rallied and appeared to regain strength.  He was\r\nsometimes irritated at sight of the courtiers who filled his chamber.\r\n“Those gentry,” he said to his most confidential servants, “come to see\r\nhow soon I shall die.  If I recover, I will make them pay dearly for\r\ntheir desire to have me die.”  The austere nature of Louis XIII. was\r\nawakened again with the transitory return of his powers; the severities\r\nof his reign were his own as much as Cardinal Richelieu’s.\r\n\r\nHe was, nevertheless, dying, asking God for deliverance.  It was\r\nThursday, May 14.  “Friday has always been my lucky day,” said Louis\r\nXIII.: “on that day I have undertaken assaults that I have carried; I\r\nhave even gained battles: I should have liked to die on a Friday.”  His\r\ndoctors told him that they could find no more pulse; he raised his eyes\r\nto heaven and said out loud, “My God, receive me to mercy!” and\r\naddressing himself to all, he added, “Let us pray!”  Then, fixing his\r\neyes upon the Bishop of Meaux, he said, “You will, of course, see when\r\nthe time comes for reading the agony prayers; I have marked them all.”\r\n Everybody was praying and weeping; the queen and all the court were\r\nkneeling in the king’s chamber.  At three o’clock, he softly breathed his\r\nlast, on the sane day and almost at the same moment at which his father\r\nhad died beneath the dagger of Ravaillac, thirty-three years before.\r\n\r\nFrance owed to Louis XIII. eighteen years of Cardinal Richelieu’s\r\ngovernment; and that is a service which she can never forget.  “The\r\nminister made his sovereign play the second part in the monarchy and the\r\nfirst in Europe,” said Montesquieu: “he abased the king, but he exalted\r\nthe reign.”  It is to the honor of Louis XIII. that he understood and\r\naccepted the position designed for him by Providence in the government of\r\nhis kingdom, and that he upheld with dogged fidelity a power which often\r\ngalled him all the while that it was serving him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.----LOUIS XIII., RICHELIEU, AND LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nCardinal Richelieu was dead, and “his works followed him,” to use the\r\nwords of Holy Writ.  At home and abroad, in France and in Europe, he had\r\nto a great extent continued the reign of Henry IV., and had completely\r\ncleared the way for that of Louis XIV.  “Such was the strength and\r\nsuperiority of his genius that he knew all the depths and all the\r\nmysteries of government,” said La Bruyere in his admission-speech before\r\nthe French Academy; “he was regardful of foreign countries, he kept in\r\nhand crowned heads, he knew what weight to attach to their alliance;\r\nwith allies he hedged himself against the enemy.  .  .  .  And, can you\r\nbelieve it, gentlemen? this practical and austere soul, formidable to the\r\nenemies of the state, inexorable to the factious, overwhelmed in\r\nnegotiations, occupied at one time in weakening the party of heresy, at\r\nanother in breaking up a league, and at another in meditating a conquest,\r\nfound time for literary culture, and was fond of literature and of those\r\nwho made it their profession!”  From inclination and from personal\r\ninterest therein this indefatigable and powerful mind had courted\r\nliterature; he had foreseen its nascent power; he had divined in the\r\nliterary circle he got about him a means of acting upon the whole nation;\r\nhe had no idea of neglecting them; he did not attempt to subjugate them\r\nopenly; he brought them near to him and protected them.  It is one of\r\nRichelieu’s triumphs to have founded the French Academy.\r\n\r\nWe must turn back for a moment and cast a glance at the intellectual\r\ncondition which prevailed at the issue of the Renaissance and the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\nFor sixty years a momentous crisis had been exercising language and\r\nliterature as well as society in France.  They yearned to get out of it.\r\nRobust intellectual culture had, ceased to be the privilege of the\r\nerudite only; it began to gain a footing on the common domain; people no\r\nlonger wrote in Latin, like Erasmus; the Reformation and the Renaissance\r\nspoke French.  In order to suffice for this change, the language was\r\ntaking form; everybody had lent a hand to the work; Calvin with his\r\nChristian Institutes (_Institution Chretienne_) at the same time as\r\nRabelais with his learned and buffoonish romance, Ramus with his\r\nDialectics, and Bodin with his Republic, Henry Estienne with his essays\r\nin French philology, as well as Ronsard and his friends by their\r\nclassical crusade.  Simultaneously with the language there was being\r\ncreated a public intelligent, inquiring, and eager.  Scarcely had the\r\ntranslation of Plutarch by Amyot appeared, when it at once became, as\r\nMontaigne says, “the breviary of women and of ignoramuses.”  “God’s life,\r\nmy love,” wrote Henry IV. to Mary de’ Medici, “you could not have sent me\r\nany more agreeable news than of the pleasure you have taken in reading.\r\nPlutarch has a smile for me of never-failing freshness; to love him is to\r\nlove me, for he was during a long while the instructor of my tender age;\r\nmy good mother, to whom I owe everything, and who set so great store on\r\nmy good deportment, and did not want me to be (that is what she used to\r\nsay) an illustrious ignoramus, put that book into my hands, though I was\r\nthen little more than a child at the breast.  It has been like my\r\nconscience to me, and has whispered into my ear many good hints and\r\nexcellent maxims for my behavior and for the government of my affairs.”\r\n\r\nThanks to Amyot, Plutarch “had become a Frenchman:” Montaigne would not\r\nhave been able to read him easily in Greek.  Indifferent to the\r\nReformation, which was too severe and too affirmative for him, Montaigne,\r\n“to whom Latin had been presented as his mother-tongue, rejoiced in the\r\nRenaissance without becoming a slave to it, or intoxicated with it like\r\nRabelais or Ronsard.  “The ideas I had naturally formed for myself about\r\nman,” he says, “I confirmed and fortified by the authority of others and\r\nby the sound examples of the ancients, with whom I found my judgment in\r\nconformity.”  Born in 1533, at the castle of Montaigne in Perigord, and\r\ncarefully brought up by “the good father God had given him,” Michael de\r\nMontaigne was, in his childhood, “so heavy, lazy, and sleepy, that he\r\ncould not be roused from sloth, even for the sake of play.”  He passed\r\nseveral years in the Parliament of Bordeaux, but “he had never taken a\r\nliking to jurisprudence, though his father had steeped him in it, when\r\nquite a child, to his very lips, and he was always asking himself why\r\ncommon language, so easy for every other purpose, becomes obscure and\r\nunintelligible in a contract or will, which made him fancy that the men\r\nof law had muddled everything in order to render themselves necessary.”\r\n He had lost the only man he had ever really loved, Stephen de la Boetie,\r\nan amiable and noble philosopher, counsellor in the Parliament of\r\nBordeaux.  “If I am pressed to declare why I loved him,” Montaigne used\r\nto say, “I feel that it can only be expressed by answering, because he\r\nwas he, and I was I.”  Montaigne gave up the Parliament, and travelled in\r\nSwitzerland and Italy, often stopping at Paris, and gladly returning to\r\nhis castle of Montaigne, where he wrote down what he had seen; “hungering\r\nfor self-knowledge,” inquiring, indolent, without ardor for work, an\r\nenemy of all constraint, he was at the same time frank and subtle,\r\ngentle, humane, and moderate.  As an inquiring spectator, without\r\npersonal ambition, he had taken for his life’s motto, “Who knows?  (Que\r\nsais-je?)”  Amidst the wars of religion he remained without political or\r\nreligious passion.  “I am disgusted by novelty, whatever aspect it may\r\nassume, and with good reason,” he would say, “for I have seen some very\r\ndisastrous effects of it.”  Outside as well as within himself, Montaigne\r\nstudied mankind without regard to order and without premeditated plan.\r\n“I have no drill-sergeant to arrange my pieces (of writing) save\r\nhap-hazard only,” he writes; “just as my ideas present themselves, I heap\r\nthem together; sometimes they come rushing in a throng, sometimes they\r\nstraggle single file.  I like to be seen at my natural and ordinary pace,\r\nall a-hobble though it be; I let myself go, just as it happens.  The\r\nparlance I like is a simple and natural parlance, the same on paper as in\r\nthe mouth, a succulent and a nervous parlance, short and compact, not so\r\nmuch refined and finished to a hair as impetuous and brusque, difficult\r\nrather than wearisome, devoid of affectation, irregular, disconnected,\r\nand bold, not pedant-like, not preacher-like, not pleader-like.”  That\r\nfixity which Montaigne could not give to his irresolute and doubtful mind\r\nhe stamped upon the tongue; it came out in his Essays supple, free, and\r\nbold; he had made the first decisive step towards the formation of the\r\nlanguage, pending the advent of Descartes and the great literature of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century began everything, attempted everything; it\r\naccomplished and finished nothing; its great men opened the road of the\r\nfuture to France; but they died without having brought their work well\r\nthrough, without foreseeing that it was going to be completed.  The\r\nReformation itself did not escape this misappreciation and discouragement\r\nof its age; and nowhere do they crop out in a more striking manner than\r\nin Montaigne.  At the beginning of the sixteenth century, Rabelais is a\r\nsatirist and a cynic, he is no sceptic; there is felt circulating through\r\nhis book a glowing sap of confidence and hope; fifty years later,\r\nMontaigne, on the contrary, expresses, in spite of his happy nature,\r\nin vivid, picturesque, exuberant language, only the lassitude of an\r\nantiquated age.  Henry IV. was still disputing his throne with the League\r\nand Spain.  Several times, amidst his embarrassments and his wars, the\r\nking had manifested his desire to see Montaigne; but the latter was ill,\r\nand felt “death nipping him continually in the throat or the reins.”  And\r\nhe died, in fact, at his own house, on the 13th of September, 1592,\r\nwithout having had the good fortune to see Henry IV. in peaceable\r\npossession of the kingdom which was destined to receive from him,\r\ntogether with stability and peace, a return of generous hope.  All the\r\nwriters of mark in the reign of Henry IV. bear the same imprint; they all\r\nyearn to get free from the chaos of those ideas and sentiments which the\r\nsixteenth century left still bubbling up.  In literature as well as in\r\nthe state, one and the same need of discipline and unity, one universal\r\nthirst for order and peace was bringing together all the intellects and\r\nall the forces which were but lately clashing against and hampering one\r\nanother; in literature, as well as in the state, the impulse, everywhere\r\ngreat and effective, proceeded from the king, without pressure or effort.\r\n“Make known to Monsieur de Geneve,” said Henry IV. to one of the friends\r\nof St. Francis de Sales, “that I desire of him a work to serve as a\r\nmanual for all persons of the court and the great world, without\r\nexcepting kings and princes, to fit them for living Christianly each\r\naccording to their condition.  I want this manual to be accurate,\r\njudicious, and such as any one can make use of.”  St. Francis de Sales\r\npublished, in 1608, the _Introduction to a Devout Life,_ a delightful and\r\ncharming manual of devotion, more stern and firm in spirit than in form,\r\na true Christian regimen softened by the tact of a delicate and acute\r\nintellect, knowing the world and its ways.  “The book has surpassed my\r\nhope,” said Henry IV.  The style is as supple, the fancy as rich, as\r\nMontaigne’s; but scepticism has given place to Christianism; St. Francis\r\nde Sales does not doubt, he believes; ingenious and moderate withal, he\r\nescapes out of the controversies of the violent and the incertitudes of\r\nthe sceptics.  The step is firm, the march is onward towards the\r\nseventeenth century, towards the reign of order, rule, and method.\r\n\r\nThe vigorous language and the beautiful arrangement in the style of the\r\nmagistrates had already prepared the way for its advent.  Descartes was\r\nthe first master of it and its great exponent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Descartes at Amsterdam----316]\r\n\r\nNever was any mind more independent in voluntary submission to an\r\ninexorable logic.  Rene Descartes, who was born at La Haye, near Tours,\r\nin 1596, and died at Stockholm in 1650, escaped the influence of\r\nRichelieu by the isolation to which he condemned himself, as well as by\r\nthe proud and somewhat uncouth independence of his character.  Engaging\r\nas a volunteer, at one and twenty, in the Dutch army, he marched over\r\nGermany in the service of several princes, returned to France, where he\r\nsold his property, travelled through the whole of Italy, and ended, in\r\n1629, by settling himself in Holland, seeking everywhere solitude and\r\nroom for his thoughts.  “In this great city of Amsterdam, where I am\r\nnow,” he wrote to Balzac, “and where there is not a soul, except myself,\r\nthat does not follow some commercial pursuit, everybody is so attentive\r\nto his gains, that I might live there all my life without being noticed\r\nby anybody.  I go walking every day amidst the confusion of a\r\ngreat people with as much freedom and quiet as you could do in your\r\nforest-alleys, and I pay no more attention to the people who pass before\r\nmy eyes than I should do to the trees that are in your forests and to the\r\nanimals that feed there.  Even the noise of traffic does not interrupt my\r\nreveries any more than would that of some rivulet.”  Having devoted\r\nhimself for a long time past to the study of geometry and astronomy, he\r\ncomposed in Holland his Treatise on the World (_Traite du Monde_).  “I\r\nhad intended to send you my _World_ for your New Year’s gift,” he wrote\r\nto the learned Minime, Father Mersenne, who was his best friend; “but I\r\nmust tell you that, having had inquiries made, lately, at Leyden and at\r\nAmsterdam, whether Galileo’s system of the world was to be obtained\r\nthere, word was sent me that all the copies of it had been burned at\r\nRome, and the author condemned to some fine, which astounded me so\r\nmightily that I almost resolved to burn all my papers, or at least not\r\nlet them be seen by anybody.  I confess that if the notion of the earth’s\r\nmotion is false, all the foundations of my philosophy are too, since it\r\nis clearly demonstrated by them.  It is so connected with all parts of my\r\ntreatise that I could not detach it without rendering the remainder\r\nwholly defective.  But as I would not, for anything in the world, that\r\nthere should proceed from me a discourse in which there was to be found\r\nthe least word which might be disapproved of by the church, so would I\r\nrather suppress it altogether than let it appear mutilated.”\r\n\r\nDescartes’ independence of thought did not tend to revolt, as he had\r\nproved: in publishing his _Discourse on Method_ he halted at the\r\nthreshold of Christianism without laying his hand upon the sanctuary.\r\nMaking a clean sweep of all he had learned, and tearing himself free,\r\nby a supreme effort, from the whole tradition of humanity, he resolved\r\n“never to accept anything as true until he recognized it to be clearly\r\nso, and not to comprise amongst his opinions anything but what presented\r\nitself so clearly and distinctly to his mind that he could have no\r\noccasion to hold it in doubt.”  In this absolute isolation of his mind,\r\nwithout past and without future, Descartes, first of all assured of his\r\nown personal existence by that famous axiom, “Cogito, ergo sum” (I think,\r\ntherefore I am), drew from it, as a necessary consequence, the fact of\r\nthe separate existence of soul and of body; passing oft by a sort of\r\ninternal revelation which he called innate ideas, he came to the pinnacle\r\nof his edifice, concluding for the existence of a God from the notion of\r\nthe infinite impressed on the human soul.  A laborious reconstruction of\r\na primitive and simple truth which the philosopher could not, for a\r\nsingle moment, have banished from his mind all the while that he was\r\nlaboring painfully to demonstrate it.\r\n\r\nBy a tacit avowal of the weakness of the human mind, the speculations of\r\nDescartes stopped short at death.  He had hopes, however, of retarding\r\nthe moment of it.  “I felt myself alive,” he said, at forty years of age,\r\n“and, examining myself with as much care as if I were a rich old man, I\r\nfancied I was even farther from death than I had been in my youth.”  He\r\nhad yielded to the entreaties of Queen Christina of Sweden, who had\r\npromised him an observatory, like that of Tycho Brahe.  He was delicate,\r\nand accustomed to follow a regimen adapted to his studies.  “O flesh!”\r\n he wrote to Gassendi, whose philosophy contradicted his own: “O idea!”\r\n answered Gassendi.  The climate of Stockholm was severe; Descartes caught\r\ninflammation of the lungs; he insisted upon doctoring himself, and died\r\non the 11th of February, 1650.  “He didn’t want to resist death,” said\r\nhis friends, not admitting that their master’s will could be vanquished\r\nby death itself.  His influence remained for a long while supreme over\r\nhis age.  Bossuet and Fenelon were Cartesians.  “I think, therefore I\r\nam,” wrote Madame de Sevigne to her daughter.  “I think of you tenderly,\r\ntherefore I love you; I think only of you in that manner, therefore I\r\nlove you only.”  Pascal alone, though adopting to a certain extent\r\nDescartes’ form of reasoning, foresaw the excess to which other minds\r\nless upright and less firm would push the system of the great\r\nphilosopher.  “I cannot forgive Descartes,” he said; “he would have\r\nliked, throughout his philosophy, to be able to do without God, but he\r\ncould not help making Him give just a flick to set the world in motion;\r\nafter that he didn’t know what to do with God.”  A severe, but a true\r\nsaying; Descartes had required everything of pure reason; he had felt a\r\nforeshadowing of the infinite and the unknown without daring to venture\r\ninto them.  In the name of reason, others have denied the infinite and\r\nthe unknown.  Pascal was wiser and bolder when, with St. Augustine, he\r\nfound in reason itself a step towards faith.  “Reason would never give in\r\nif she were not of opinion that there are occasions when she ought to\r\ngive in.”\r\n\r\nBy his philosophical method, powerful and logical, as well as by the\r\nclear, strong, and concise style he made use of to expound it, Descartes\r\naccomplished the transition from the sixteenth century to the seventeeth;\r\nhe was the first of the great prose-writers of that incomparable epoch,\r\nwhich laid forever the foundations of the language.  At the same moment\r\nthe great Corneille was rendering poetry the same service.\r\n\r\nIt had come out of the sixteenth century more disturbed and less formed\r\nthan prose; Ronsard and his friends had received it from the hands of\r\nMarot, quite young, unsophisticated and undecided; they attempted, at the\r\nfirst effort, to raise it to the level of the great classic models of\r\nwhich their minds were full.  The attempt was bold, and the Pleiad did\r\nnot pretend to consult the taste of the vulgar.  “The obscurity of\r\nRonsard,” says M. Guizot, in his _Corneille et son Temps,_ “is not that\r\nof a subtle mind torturing itself to make something out of nothing; it is\r\nthe obscurity of a full and a powerful mind, which is embarrassed by its\r\nown riches, and has not learned to regulate the use of them.  Furnished,\r\nby his reading of the ancients, with that which was wanting in our\r\npoetry, Ronsard thought he could perceive in his lofty and really\r\npoetical imagination what was needed to supply it; he cast his eyes in\r\nall directions, with the view of enriching the domain of poetry.\r\n‘Thou wilt do well to pick dexterously,’ he says, in his abridgment of\r\nthe art of French poetry, ‘and adopt to thy work the most expressive\r\nwords in the dialects of our own France; there is no need to care whether\r\nthe vocables are Gascon, or Poitevin, or Norman, or Mancese, or Lyonnese,\r\nor of other districts, provided that they are good, and properly express\r\nwhat thou wouldst say.’  Ronsard was too bold in extending his conquests\r\nover the classical languages; it was that exuberance of ideas, that\r\neffervescence of a genius not sufficiently master over its conceptions,\r\nwhich brought down upon him, in after times, the contempt of the writers\r\nwho, in the seventeenth century, followed, with more wisdom and taste,\r\nthe road which he had contributed to open.  ‘He is not,’ said Balzac,\r\n‘quite a poet; he has the first beginnings and the making of a poet; we\r\nsee in his works nascent and half-animated portions of a body which is in\r\nformation, but which does not care to arrive at completion.’ ”\r\n\r\nThis body is that of French poetry; Ronsard traced out its first\r\nlineaments, full of elevation, play of fancy, images, and a poetic fire\r\nunknown before him.  He was the first to comprehend the dignity which\r\nbefits grand subjects, and which earned him in his day the title of\r\nPrince of poets.  He lived in stormy times, not much adapted for poetry,\r\nand steeped in the most cruel tragedies; he felt deeply the misfortunes\r\nof his country rent by civil war, when he wrote,--\r\n\r\n          “A cry of dread, a din, a thundering sound\r\n          Of men and clashing harness roars around;\r\n          Peoples ‘gainst peoples furiously rage;\r\n          Cities with cities deadly battle wage;\r\n          Temples and towns--one heap of ashes lie;\r\n          Justice and equity fade out and die\r\n          Unchecked the soldier’s wicked will is done\r\n          With human blood the outraged churches run;\r\n          Bedridden Age, disbedded, perisheth,\r\n          And over all grins the pale face of Death.”\r\n\r\nThere was something pregnant, noble, and brilliant about Ronsard, in\r\nspite of his exaggerations of style and faults of taste; his friends and\r\ndisciples imitated and carried to an extreme his defects, without\r\npossessing his talent; the unruliness was such as to call for reform.\r\nPeace revived with Henry IV., and the court, henceforth in accord with\r\nthe nation, resumed that empire over taste, manners, and ideas, which it\r\nwas destined to exercise so long and so supremely under Louis XIV.\r\nMalherbe became the poet of the court, whose business it was to please\r\nit, to adopt for it that literature which had but lately been reserved\r\nfor the feasts of the learned.  “He used often to say, and chiefly when\r\nhe was reproached with not following the meaning of the authors he\r\ntranslated or paraphrased, that he did not dress his meat for cooks, as\r\nif he had meant to infer that he cared very little to be praised by the\r\nliterary folks who understood the books he had translated, provided that\r\nhe was understood by the court-folks.”  A complete revolution in the\r\nopposite direction to that which Ronsard attempted appeared to have taken\r\nplace, but the human mind never loses all the ground it has once won; in\r\nthe verses of Malherbe, often bearing the imprint of beauties borrowed\r\nfrom the ancients, the language preserved, in consequence of the\r\ncharacter given to it by Ronsard, a dignity, a richness of style, of\r\nwhich the times of Marot showed no conception; and it was falling,\r\nmoreover, under the chastening influence of an elegant correctness.  It\r\nwas for the court that Malherbe made verses, “striving, as he said, to\r\ndegasconnize it,” seeking there his public and the source of honor as\r\nwell as profit.  As passionate an admirer of Richelieu as of Henry IV.,\r\nnaturally devoted to the service of the order established in the state as\r\nwell as in poetry, he, under the regency of Mary de’ Medici, favored the\r\ntaste which was beginning to show itself for intellectual things, for\r\nrefined pleasures, and elegant occupations.  It was not around the queen\r\nthat this honorable and agreeable society gathered; it was at the Hotel\r\nRambouillet, around Catherine de Vivonne, in Rue St. Thomas du Louvre.\r\nLiterature was there represented by Malherbe and Racan, afterwards by\r\nBalzac and Voiture, Gombault and Chapelain, who constantly met there, in\r\ncompany with Princess de Conde and her daughter, subsequently Duchess de\r\nLongueville, Mademoiselle du Vigean, Madame and Mdlle. d’Epernon, and the\r\nBishop of Lucon himself, quite young as yet, but already famous.  “All\r\nthe wits were received at the Hotel Rambouillet, whatever their\r\ncondition,” says M. Cousin: “all that was asked of them was to have good\r\nmanners; but the aristocratic tone was established there without any\r\neffort, the majority of the guests at the house being very great lords,\r\nand the mistress being at one and the same time Rambouillet and Vivonne.\r\nThe wits were courted and honored, but they did not hold the dominion.”\r\n At that great period which witnessed the growth of Richelieu’s power, and\r\nof the action he universally exercised upon French society, at the\r\noutcome from the moral licentiousness which Henry IV.’s example had\r\nencouraged in his court, and after a certain roughness, the fruit of long\r\ncivil wars, a lesson was taught at Madame de Rambouillet’s of modesty,\r\ngrace, and lofty politeness, together with the art of forming good ideas\r\nand giving them good expression, sometimes with rather too much of\r\nfar-fetched and affected cleverness, always in good company, and with\r\nmuch sweetness and self-possession on the part of the mistress of the\r\nhouse.  In 1627, Cardinal Richelieu, having become minister, sent the\r\nMarquis of Rambouillet as ambassador to Spain.  He wanted to be repaid\r\nfor this favor.  One of his friends went to call upon Madame de\r\nRambouillet.  At the first hint of what was expected from her, “I do not\r\nbelieve that there are any intrigues between Cardinal Valette and the\r\nprincess,” said she, “and, even if there were, I should not be the proper\r\nperson for the office it is intended to put upon me.  Besides, everybody\r\nis so convinced of the consideration and friendship I have for his\r\nEminence that nobody would dare to speak ill of him in my presence; I\r\ncannot, therefore, ever have an opportunity of rendering him the services\r\nyou ask of me.”\r\n\r\nThe cardinal did not persist, and remained well disposed towards Hotel\r\nRambouillet.  Completely occupied in laying solidly the foundations of\r\nhis power, in checkmating and punishing conspiracies at court, and in\r\nbreaking down the party of the Huguenots, he had no leisure just yet to\r\nthink of literature and the literary.  He had, nevertheless, in 1626,\r\nbegun removing the ruins of the Sorbonne, with a view of reconstructing\r\nthe buildings on a new plan and at his own expense.  He wrote, in 1627,\r\nto M. Saintot, “I thank him for the care he has taken of the Sorbonne,\r\nbegging him to continue it, assuring him that, though I have many\r\nexpenses on my hands, I am as desirous of continuing to build up that\r\nhouse as of contributing, to the best of my little ability, to pull down\r\nthe fortifications of La Rochelle.”  The works were not completely\r\nfinished at the death of the cardinal, who provided therefor by his will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The King’s Press----323]\r\n\r\nAt the same time that he was repairing and enriching the Sorbonne, the\r\ncardinal was helping Guy de la Brosse, the king’s physician, to create\r\nthe Botanic Gardens (_Le Jardin des Plantes_), he was defending the\r\nindependence of the College of France against the pretensions of the\r\nUniversity of Paris, and gave it for its Grand Almoner his brother, the\r\nArchbishop of Lyons.  He was preparing the foundation of the King’s Press\r\n(_Imprimerie royale_), definitively created in 1640; and he gave the\r\nAcademy or King’s College (college royal) of his town of Richelieu a\r\nregulation-code of studies which bears the imprint of his lofty and\r\nstrong mind.  He prescribed a deep study of the French tongue.  “It often\r\nhappens, unfortunately, that the difficulties which must be surmounted\r\nand the long time which is employed in learning the dead languages,\r\nbefore any knowledge of the sciences can be arrived at, have the effect,\r\nat the outset, of making young gentlemen disgusted and hasten to betake\r\nthemselves to the exercise of arms without having been sufficiently\r\ninstructed in good literature, though it is the fairest ornament of their\r\nprofession.  .  .  .  It has, therefore, been thought necessary to\r\nestablish a royal academy at which discipline suitable to their condition\r\nmay be taught them in the French tongue, in order that they may exercise\r\nthemselves therein, and that even foreigners, who are curious about it,\r\nmay learn to know its riches and the graces it hath in unfolding the\r\nsecrets of the highest discipline.”  Herein is revealed the founder of\r\nthe French Academy, skilful as he was in divining the wants of his day,\r\nand always ready to profit by new means of action, and to make them his\r\nown whilst doing them service.\r\n\r\nAssociations of the literary were not unknown in France; Ronsard and his\r\nfriends, at first under the name of the brigade and then under that of\r\nthe Pleiad, often met to read together their joint productions, and to\r\ndiscuss literary questions; and the same thing was done, subsequently, in\r\nMalherbe’s rooms.\r\n\r\n“Now let us speak at our ease,” Balzac would say, when the sitting was\r\nover, “and without fear of committing solecisms.”\r\n\r\nWhen Malherbe was dead and Balzac had retired to his country house on the\r\nborders of the Charente, some friends, “men of letters and of merits very\r\nmuch above the average,” says Pellisson in his _Histoire de l’Academie\r\nFrancaise,_ “finding that nothing was more inconvenient in this great\r\ncity than to go often and often to call upon one another without finding\r\nanybody at home, resolved to meet one day in the week at the house of one\r\nof them.  They used to assemble at M. Conrart’s, who happened to be most\r\nconveniently quartered for receiving them, and in the very heart of the\r\ncity (Rue St. Martin).  There they conversed familiarly as they would\r\nhave on an ordinary visit, and upon all sorts of things, business, news,\r\nand literature.  If any one of the company had a work done, as, often\r\nhappened, he readily communicated its contents to all the others, who\r\nfreely gave him their opinion of it, and their conferences were followed\r\nsometimes by a walk and sometimes by a collation which they took\r\ntogether.  Thus they continued for three or four years, as I have heard\r\nmany amongst them say; it was an extreme pleasure and an incredible gain,\r\ninsomuch that, when they speak nowadays of that time and of those early\r\ndays of the Academy, they speak of it as a golden age during the which,\r\nwithout bustle and without show, and without any other laws but those of\r\nfriendship, they enjoyed all that is sweetest and most charming in the\r\nintercourse of intellects and in rational life.”\r\n\r\nEven after the intervention and regulationizing of Cardinal Richelieu,\r\nthe French Academy still preserved something of that sweetness and that\r\npolished familiarity in their relations which caused the regrets of its\r\nearliest founders.  [They were MM. Godeau, afterwards Bishop of Grasse,\r\nConrart and Gombault who were Huguenots, Chapelain, Giry, Habert, Abbe de\r\nCerisy, his brother, M. de Serizay and M. de Maleville.] The secret of\r\nthe little gatherings was not so well kept but that Bois-Robert, the\r\ncardinal’s accredited gossip, ever on the alert for news to divert his\r\npatron, heard of them and begged before long to be present at them.\r\n“There was no probability of his being refused, for, besides that he was\r\non friendly terms with many of these gentlemen, the very favor he enjoyed\r\ngave him some sort of authority and added to his consequence.  He was\r\nfull of delight and admiration at what he saw, and did not fail to give\r\nthe cardinal a favorable account of the little assembly, insomuch that\r\nthe cardinal, who had a mind naturally inclined towards great things, and\r\nwho loved the French language, which he himself wrote extremely well,\r\nasked if those persons would not be disposed to form a body and assembly\r\nregularly and under public authority.”  Bois-Robert was intrusted with\r\nthe proposal.\r\n\r\nGreat was the consternation in the little voluntary and friendly Academy.\r\n“There was scarcely one of these gentlemen who did not testify\r\ndispleasure: MM. de Serizay and de Maleville, who were attached to the\r\nhouseholds of the Duke of La Rochefoucauld and Marshal Bassompierre, one\r\nin retirement on his estates and the other a prisoner in the Bastille,\r\nwere for refusing and excusing themselves as best they might to the\r\ncardinal.  Chapelain, who had a pension from his Eminence, represented\r\nthat “in good truth he could have been well pleased to dispense with\r\nhaving their conferences thus bruited abroad, but in the position to\r\nwhich things were reduced, it was not open to them to follow the more\r\nagreeable of the two courses; they had to do with a man who willed in no\r\nhalf-hearted way whatever he willed, and who was not accustomed to meet\r\nresistance or to stiffer it with impunity; he would consider as an insult\r\nthe disregard shown for his protection, and might visit his resentment\r\nupon each individual; he could, at any rate, easily prohibit their\r\nassemblies, breaking up by that means a society which every one of them\r\ndesired to be eternal.”  The arguments were strong, the members yielded;\r\nBois-Robert was charged to thank his Eminence very humbly for the honor\r\nhe did them, assuring him that they were all resolved to follow his\r\nwishes.  “I wish to be of that assembly the protector and the father,”\r\n said Richelieu, giving at once divers proofs that he took a great\r\ninterest in that establishment, a fact which soon brought the Academy\r\nsolicitations from those who were most intimate with the cardinal, and\r\nwho, being in some sort of repute for wit, gloried in being admitted to a\r\nbody which he regarded with favor.\r\n\r\nIn making of this little private gathering a great national institution,\r\nCardinal Richelieu yielded to his natural yearning for government and\r\ndominion; he protected literature as a minister and as an admirer; the\r\nadmirer’s inclination was supported by the minister’s influence.  At the\r\nsame time, and perhaps without being aware of it, he was giving French\r\nliterature a centre of discipline and union whilst securing for the\r\nindependence and dignity of writers a supporting-point which they had\r\nhitherto lacked.  Whilst recompensing them by favors nearly always\r\nconferred in the name of the state, he was preparing for them afar off\r\nthe means of withdrawing themselves from that private dependence, the\r\nyoke of which they nearly always had to bear.  Set free at his death from\r\nthe weight of their obligations to him, they became the servants of the\r\nstate; ere long the French Academy had no other protector but the king.\r\n\r\nOrder and rule everywhere accompanied Cardinal Richelieu; the Academy\r\ndrew up its statutes, chose a director, a chancellor, and a perpetual\r\nsecretary: Conrart was the first to be called to that honor; the number\r\nof Academicians was set down at forty by letters patent from the king.\r\n“As soon as God had called us to the conduct of this realm, we had for\r\naim, not only to apply a remedy to the disorders which the civil wars had\r\nintroduced into it, but also to enrich it with all ornaments suitable for\r\nthe most illustrious and the most ancient of the monarchies that are at\r\nthis day in the world.  Although we have labored without ceasing at the\r\nexecution of this design, it hath been impossible for us hitherto to see\r\nthe entire fulfilment thereof.  The disturbances so often excited in the\r\ngreater part of our provinces, and the assistance we have been obliged to\r\ngive to many of our allies, have diverted us from any other thought but\r\nthat of war, and have hindered us for a long while from enjoying the\r\nrepose we procured for others.  .  .  .  Our very clear and very much\r\nbeloved cousin, the cardinal-duke of Richelieu, who hath had the part\r\nthat everybody knows in all these things, hath represented to us that one\r\nof the most glorious signs of the happiness of a kingdom was that the\r\nsciences and arts should flourish there, and that letters should be in\r\nhonor there as well as arms; that, after having performed so many\r\nmemorable exploits, we had nothing further to do but to add agreeable\r\nthings to the necessary, and ornament to utility; and he was of opinion\r\nthat we could not begin better than with the most noble of all the arts,\r\nwhich is eloquence; that the French tongue, which up to the present hath\r\nonly too keenly felt the neglect of those who might have rendered it the\r\nmost perfect of the day, is more than ever capable of becoming so, seeing\r\nthe number of persons who have knowledge of the advantages it possesses;\r\nit is to establish fixed rules for it that he hath ordained an assembly\r\nwhose propositions were satisfactory to him.  For these reasons and in\r\norder to secure the said conferences, we will that they continue\r\nhenceforth, in our good city of Paris, under the name of French Academy,\r\nand that letters patent be enregistered to that end by our gentry of the\r\nParliament of Paris.”\r\n\r\nThe Parliament was not disposed to fulfil the formality of\r\nenregistration.  The cardinal had compressed it, stifled it, but he had\r\nnever mastered it; the Academy was a new institution, it was regarded as\r\nhis work; on that ground it inspired great distrust in the public as well\r\nas the magistrates.  “The people, to whom everything that came from this\r\nminister looked suspicious, knew not whether beneath these flowers there\r\nwere not a serpent concealed, and were apprehensive that this\r\nestablishment was, at the very least, a new prop to support is\r\ndomination, that it was but a batch of folks in his pay, hired to\r\nmaintain all that he did and to observe the actions and sentiments of\r\nothers.  It went about that he cut down scavenging expenses of Paris by\r\neighty thousand livres in order to give them a pension of two thousand\r\nlivres apiece; the vulgar were so frightened, without attempting to\r\naccount for their terror, that a tradesman of Paris, who had taken a\r\nhouse that suited him admirably in Rue Cinq Diamants, where the Academy\r\nthen used to meet at M. Chapelain’s, broke off his bargain on no other\r\nground but that he did not want to be in a street where a _’Cademy of\r\nCanspirators (une Cademie e Manopoleurs)_ met every week.”  The wits,\r\nlike St. Evremond, in his comedy of the Academistes, turned into ridicule\r\nthe body which, as it was said, claimed to subject the language of the\r\npublic to its decisions:--\r\n\r\n               “So I, with hoary head, to’ school\r\n               Must, like a child, go day by day,\r\n               And learn my parts of speech, poor fool, when\r\n               Death is taking speech away!”\r\n\r\nsaid Maynard, who, nevertheless, was one of the forty.\r\n\r\nThe letters patent for establishment of the French Academy had been sent\r\nto the Parliament in 1635; they were not registered until 1637 at the\r\nexpress instance of the cardinal, who wrote to the premier President to\r\nassure him that “the foundation of the Academy was useful and necessary\r\nto the public, and the purpose of the Academicians was quite different\r\nfrom what it had been possible to make people believe hitherto.”\r\n\r\nThe decree of verification, when it at length appeared, bore traces of\r\nthe jealous prejudices of the Parliament.  “They the said assembly and\r\nacademy,” it ran, “shall not be powered to take cognizance of anything\r\nbut the ornamentation, embellishment, and augmentation of the French\r\nlanguage, and of the books that shall be made by them and by other\r\npersons who shall desire it and want it.”\r\n\r\nThe French Academy was founded; it was already commencing its Dictionary\r\nin accordance with the suggestion enunciated by Chapelain at the second\r\nmeeting; the cardinal was here carrying out that great moral idea of\r\nliterature which he had expressed but lately in a letter to Balzac: “The\r\nconceptions in your letters,” said he, “are forcible and as far removed\r\nfrom ordinary imaginations as they are in conformity with the common\r\nsense of those who have superior judgment.  Truth has this advantage,\r\nthat it forces those who have eyes and mind sufficiently clear to discern\r\nwhat it is to represent it without disguise.”  Neither Balzac and his\r\nfriends, nor the protection of Cardinal Richelieu, sufficed as yet to\r\ngive lustre to the Academy; great minds and great writers alone could\r\nmake the glory of their society.  The principle of the association of men\r\nof letters was, however, established: men of the world, friendly to\r\nliterature, were already preparing to mingle with them; the literary,\r\nbut lately servitors of the great, had henceforth at their disposal a\r\nprivilege envied and sought after by courtiers; their independence grew\r\nby it and their dignity gained by it.  The French Academy became an\r\ninstitution, and took its place amongst the glories of France.  It had\r\nthis piece of good fortune, that Cardinal Richelieu died without being\r\nable to carry out the project he had conceived.  He had intended to open\r\non the site of the horse-market, near Porte St. Honore and behind the\r\nPalais-Cardinal, “a great Place which he would have called Ducale in\r\nimitation of the Royale, which is at the other end of the city,” says\r\nPellisson; he had placed in the hands of M. de la Mesnardiere, a\r\nmemorandum drawn up by himself for the plan of a college “which he was\r\nmeditating for all the noble sciences, and in which he designed to employ\r\nall that was most telling for the cause of literature in Europe.  He had\r\nan idea of making the members of the Academy directors and as it were\r\narbiters of this great establishment, and aspired, with a feeling worthy\r\nof the immortality with which he was so much in love, to set up the\r\nFrench Academy there in the most distinguished position in the world, and\r\nto offer an honorable and pleasant repose to all persons of that class\r\nwho had deserved it by their labors.”  It was a noble and a liberal idea,\r\nworthy of the great mind which had conceived it; but it would have\r\nstifled the fertile germ of independence and liberty which he had\r\nunconsciously buried in the womb of the French Academy.  Pensioned and\r\nbarracked, the Academicians would have remained men of letters, shut off\r\nfrom society and the world.  The Academy grew up alone, favored indeed,\r\nbut never reduced to servitude; it alone has withstood the cruel shocks\r\nwhich have for so long a time agitated France; in a country where nothing\r\nlasts, it has lasted, with its traditions, its primitive statutes, its\r\nreminiscences, its respect for the past.  It has preserved its courteous\r\nand modest dignity, its habits of polite neutrality, the suavity and\r\nequality of the relations between its members.  It was said just now that\r\nRichelieu’s work no longer existed save in history, and that revolutions\r\nhave left him nothing but his glory; but that was a mistake: the French\r\nAcademy is still standing, stronger and freer than at its birth, and it\r\nwas founded by Richelieu, and has never forgotten him.\r\n\r\nAmongst the earliest members of the Academy the cardinal had placed his\r\nmost habitual and most intimate literary servants, Bois-Robert,\r\nDesmarets, Colletet, all writers for the theatre, employed by Richelieu\r\nin his own dramatic attempts.  Theatrical representations were the only\r\npleasure the minister enjoyed, in accord with the public of his day.  He\r\nhad everywhere encouraged this taste, supporting with marked favor ,\r\nHardy and the _Theatre Parisien_.  With his mind constantly exercised by\r\nthe wants of the government, he soon sought in the theatre a means of\r\nacting upon the masses.  He had already foreseen the power of the press;\r\nhe had laid hands on Doctor Renaudot’s _Gazette de France;_ King Louis\r\nXIII. often wrote articles in it; the manuscript exists in the National\r\nLibrary, with some corrections which appear to be Richelieu’s.  As for\r\nthe theatre, the cardinal aspired to try his own hand at the work; his\r\nliterary labors were nearly all political pieces; his tragedy of\r\n_Mirame,_ to which he attached so much value, and which he had\r\nrepresented at such great expense for the opening of his theatre in the\r\nPalais-Cardinal, is nothing but one continual allusion, often bold even\r\nto insolence, to Buckingham’s feelings towards Anne of Austria.  The\r\ncomedy, in heroic style, of Europe, which appeared in the name of\r\n_Desmarets,_ after the cardinal’s death, is a political allegory touching\r\nthe condition of the world.  Francion and Ibere contend together for the\r\nfavors of Europe, not without, at the same time, paying court to the\r\nPrincess Austrasia (Lorraine).  All the cardinal’s foreign policy, his\r\nalliances with Protestants, are there described in verses which do not\r\nlack a certain force: Germanique (the emperor) pleads the cause of Ibere\r\nwith Europe:--\r\n\r\n          “No longer can he brook to gaze on such as these,\r\n          Destroyers of the shrines, foes of the Deities,\r\n          By Francion evoked from out the Frozen Main,[1]\r\n          That he might cope with us and equal war maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EUROPE.\r\n\r\n          O, call not by those names th’ indomitable race,\r\n          Who ‘midst my champions hold honorable place.\r\n          Unlike to us, they own no shrine, no sacrifice;\r\n          But still, unlike Ibere, they use no artifice;\r\n          About the Gods they speak their mind as seemeth best,\r\n          Whilst he, with pious air, still keepeth me opprest;\r\n          Through them I hold mine own, from harm and insult free,\r\n          Their errors I deplore, their valor pleases me.\r\n          What was that noble king,[2] that puissant conqueror,\r\n          Who through thy regions, like a mighty torrent, tore?\r\n          Who marched with giant strides along the path of fame,\r\n          And, in the hour of death, left victory with his name?\r\n          What are those gallant chiefs, who from his ashes rose,\r\n          Whom still, methinks, his shade assists against their foes?\r\n\r\n          [1] The Swedes.

[2] Prince of Orange. [3] The Hollanders.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready, in Mirame, Richelieu had celebrated the fall of Rochelle and of\r\nthe Huguenot party, bringing upon the scene the King of Bithynia, who is\r\ntaking arms\r\n\r\n                         “To tame a rebel slave,\r\n          Perched proudly on his rock washed by the ocean-wave.”\r\n\r\nAs epigraph to Europe there were these lines:--\r\n\r\n          “All friends of France to this my work will friendly be;\r\n          And all unfriends of her will say the author ill;\r\n          Yet shall I be content, say, reader, what you will;\r\n          The joy of some, the rage of others, pleases me.”\r\n\r\nThe enemies of France did not wait for the comedy, in heroic style, of\r\nEurope in order to frequently say ill of Cardinal Richelieu.\r\n\r\nOccupied as he was in governing the affairs of France and of Europe\r\notherwise than in verse, the cardinal chose out work-fellows; there were\r\nfive of them, to whom he gave his ideas and the plan of his piece; he\r\nintrusted to each the duty of writing an act, and “by this means finished\r\na comedy a month,” says Pellisson.  Thus was composed the comedy of the\r\n_Tuileries_ and the _Aveugle de Smyrne,_ which were printed in 1638;\r\nRichelieu had likewise taken part in the composition of the _Visionnaires\r\nof Desmarets,_ and supported in a rather remarkable scene the rule of the\r\nthree unities against its detractors.  A new comedy, the _Grande\r\nPastorale,_ was in hand.  “When he was purposing to publish it,” says the\r\n_History of the Academy,_ “he desired M. Chapelain to look over it, and\r\nmake careful observations upon it.  These observations were brought to\r\nhim by M. de Bois-Robert, and, though they were written with much\r\ndiscretion and respect, they shocked and nettled him to such a degree,\r\neither by their number or by the consciousness they caused him of his\r\nfaults, that, without reading them through, he tore them up.  But on the\r\nfollowing night, when he was in bed, and all his household asleep, having\r\nthought over the anger he had shown, be did a thing incomparably more\r\nestimable than the best comedy in the world, that is to say, he listened\r\nto reason, for he gave orders to collect and glue together the pieces of\r\nthat torn paper, and, having read it from one end to the other, and given\r\ngreat thought to it, he sent and awakened M. de Bois-Robert to tell him\r\nthat he saw quite well that the gentlemen of the Academy were better\r\ninformed about such matters than he, and that there must be nothing more\r\nsaid about that paper and print.”\r\n\r\nThe cardinal ended by permitting the liberties taken in literary matters\r\nby Chapelain and even Colletet.  His courtiers were complimenting him\r\nabout some success or other obtained by the king’s arms, saying that\r\nnothing could withstand his Eminence.  “You are mistaken,” he answered,\r\nlaughing; “and I find even in Paris persons who withstand me.  There’s\r\nColletet, who, after having fought with me yesterday over a word, does\r\nnot give in yet; look at this long letter that he has just written me!”\r\n He counted, at any rate, in the number of his five work-fellows one mind\r\ntoo independent to be subservient for long to the ideas and wishes of\r\nanother, though it were Cardinal Richelieu and the premier minister.  In\r\nconjunction with Colletet, Bois-Robert, De l’Etoile, and Rotrou, Peter\r\nCorneille worked at his Eminence’s tragedies and comedies.  He handled\r\naccording to his fancy the act intrusted to him, with so much freedom\r\nthat the cardinal was shocked, and said that he lacked, in his opinion,\r\n“the follower-spirit” (_l’esprit de suite_).  Corneille did not appeal\r\nfrom this judgment; he quietly took the road to Rouen, leaving henceforth\r\nto his four work-fellows the glory of putting into form the ideas of the\r\nall-powerful minister; he worked alone, for his own hand, for the glory\r\nof France and of the human mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peter Corneille----334]\r\n\r\nPeter Corneille, born at Rouen on the 6th of June, 1606, in a family of\r\nlawyers, had been destined for the bar from his infancy; he was a\r\nbriefless barrister; his father had purchased him two government posts,\r\nbut his heart was otherwise set than “on jurisprudence;” in 1635, when he\r\nquietly renounced the honor of writing for the cardinal, Corneille had\r\nalready had several comedies played.  He himself said of the first,\r\n_Melite,_ which he wrote at three and twenty, “It was my first attempt,\r\nand it has no pretence of being according to the rules, for I did not\r\nknow then that there were any.  I had for guide nothing but a little\r\ncommon sense, together with the models of the late Hardy, whose vein was\r\nrather fertile than polished.”  “The comedies of Corneille had met with\r\nsuccess; praised as he was by his competitors in the career of the\r\ntheatre, he was as yet, in their eyes, but one of the supports of that\r\nliterary glory which was common to them all.  Tranquil in their\r\npossession of bad taste, they were far from foreseeing the revolution\r\nwhich was about to overthrow its sway and their own.”  [_Corneille et son\r\nTemps,_ by M. Guizot.]\r\n\r\nCorneille made his first appearance in tragedy, in 1633, with a _Medee_.\r\n“Here are verses which proclaim Corneille,” said Voltaire:--\r\n\r\n          “After so many boons, to leave me can he bear?\r\n          After so many sins, to leave me can he dare?”\r\n\r\nThey proclaimed tragedy; it had appeared at last to Corneille; its\r\nfeatures, roughly sketched, were nevertheless recognizable.  He was\r\nalready studying Spanish with an old friend of his family, and was\r\nworking at the _Cid,_ when he brought out his _Illusion Comique,_ a\r\nmediocre piece, Corneille’s last sacrifice to the taste of his day.\r\nTowards the end of the year 1636, the _Cid_ was played for the first time\r\nat Paris.  There was a burst of enthusiasm forthwith.  “I wish you were\r\nhere,” wrote the celebrated comedian Mondory to Balzac, on the 18th of\r\nJanuary, 1637, “to enjoy amongst other pleasures that of the beautiful\r\ncomedies that are being played, and especially a _Cid_ who has charmed\r\nall Paris.  So beautiful is he that he has smitten with love all the most\r\nvirtuous ladies, whose passion has many times blazed out in the public\r\ntheatre.  Seated in a body on the benches of the boxes have been seen\r\nthose who are commonly seen only in gilded chamber and on the seat with\r\nthe fleurs-de-lis.  So great has been the throng at our doors, and our\r\nplace has turned out so small, that the corners of the theatre, which\r\nserved at other times as niches for the pageboys, have been given as a\r\nfavor to blue ribbons, and the scene has been embellished, ordinarily,\r\nwith the crosses of knights of the order.”  “It is difficult,” says\r\nPellisson, “to imagine with what approbation this piece was received by\r\ncourt and people.”  It was impossible to tire of seeing it, nothing else\r\nwas talked of in company; everybody knew some portion by heart; it was\r\ntaught to children, and in many parts of France it had passed into a\r\nproverb to say, “Beautiful as the _Cid_.”  Criticism itself was silenced\r\nfor a while; carried along in the general twirl, bewildered by its\r\nsuccess, the rivals of Corneille appeared to join the throng of his\r\nadmirers; but they soon recovered their breath, and their first sign of\r\nlife was an effort of resistance to the torrent which threatened to carry\r\nthem away; with the exception of Rotrou, who was worthy to comprehend and\r\nenjoy Corneille, the revolt was unanimous.  The malcontents and the\r\nenvious had found in Richelieu an eager and a powerful auxiliary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Representation of “the Cid.”----335]\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to fathom the causes of the cardinal’s\r\nanimosity to the _Cid_.  It was a Spanish piece, and represented in a\r\nfavorable light the traditional enemies of France and of Richelieu; it\r\nwas all in honor of the duel which the cardinal had prosecuted with such\r\nrigorous justice; it depicted a king simple, patriarchal, genial in the\r\nexercise of his power, contrary to all the views cherished by the\r\nminister touching royal majesty; all these reasons might have contributed\r\nto his wrath, but there was something more personal and petty in its\r\nbitterness.  In tacit disdain for the work that had been entrusted to\r\nhim, Corneille had abandoned Richelieu’s pieces; he had retired to Rouen;\r\nfar away from the court, he had only his successes to set against the\r\nperfidious insinuations of his rivals.  The triumph of the _Cid_ seemed\r\nto the resentful spirit of a neglected and irritated patron a sort of\r\ninsult.  Therewith was mingled a certain shade of author’s jealousy.\r\nRichelieu saw in the fame of Corneille the success of a rebel.  Egged on\r\nby base and malicious influences, he attempted to crush him as he had\r\ncrushed the house of Austria and the Huguenots.\r\n\r\nThe cabal of bad taste enlisted to a man in this new war.  Scudery was\r\nstandard-bearer; astounded that such fantastic beauties should have\r\nseduced knowledge as well as ignorance, and the court as well as the cit,\r\nand conjuring decent folks to suspend judgment for a while, and not\r\ncondemn without a hearing _Sophonisbe, Cesar, Cleopdtre, Hercule,\r\nMarianne, Cleomedon,_ and so many other illustrious heroes who had\r\ncharmed them on the stage.”  Corneille might have been satisfied; his\r\nadversaries themselves recognized his great popularity and success.\r\n\r\nA singular mixture of haughtiness and timidity, of vigorous imagination\r\nand simplicity of judgment!  It was by his triumphs that Corneille had\r\nbecome informed of his talents; but, when once aware, he had accepted the\r\nconviction thereof as that of those truths which one does not arrive at\r\nby one’s self absolutely, without explanation, without modification.\r\n\r\n          “I know my worth, and well believe men’s rede of it;\r\n          I have no need of leagues, to make myself admired;\r\n          Few voices may be raised for me, but none is hired;\r\n          To swell th’ applause my just ambition seeks no claque,\r\n          Nor out of holes and corners hunts the hireling pack:\r\n          Upon the boards, quite self-supported, mount my plays,\r\n          And every one is free to censure or to praise;\r\n          There, though no friends expound their views or preach my\r\n          cause,\r\n          It hath been many a time my lot to win applause;\r\n          There, pleased with the success my modest merit won,\r\n          With brilliant critics’ laws I seek to dazzle none;\r\n          To court and people both I give the same delight,\r\n          Mine only partisans the verses that I write;\r\n          To them alone I owe the credit of my pen,\r\n          To my own self alone the fame I win of men;\r\n          And if, when rivals meet, I claim equality,\r\n          Methinks I do no wrong to whosoe’er it be.”\r\n\r\n“Let him rise on the wings of composition,” said La Bruyere, “and he is\r\nnot below Augustus, Pompey, Nicodemus, Sertorius; he is a king and a\r\ngreat king; he is a politician, he is a philosopher.”  Modest and bashfnl\r\nin what concerns himself, when it has nothing to do with his works and\r\nhis talents, Corneille, who does not disdain to receive a pension from\r\nCardinal Richelieu, or, in writing to Scudery, to call him “your master\r\nand and mine,” becomes quite another creature when he defends his genius:\r\n\r\n          “Leaving full oft the earth, soon as he leaves the goal,\r\n          With lofty flight he soars into the upper air,\r\n          Looks down on envious men, and smiles at their despair.”\r\n\r\nThe contest was becoming fierce and bitter; much was written for and\r\nagainst the _Cid;_ the public remained faithful to it; the cardinal\r\ndetermined to submit it to the judgment of the Academy, thus exacting\r\nfrom that body an act of complaisance towards himself as well as an act\r\nof independence and authority in the teeth of predominant opinion.  At\r\nhis instigation, Scudery wrote to the Academy to make them the judges in\r\nthe dispute.  “The cardinal’s desire was plain to see,” says Pellisson;\r\n“but the most judicious amongst that body testified a great deal of\r\nrepugnance to this design.  They said that the Academy, which was only in\r\nits cradle, ought not to incur odium by a judgment which might perhaps\r\ndisplease both parties, and which could not fail to cause umbrage to one\r\nat least, that is to say, to a great part of France; that they were\r\nscarcely tolerated, from the mere fancy which prevailed that they\r\npretended to some authority over the French tongue; what would be the\r\ncase if they proved to have exercised it in respect of a work which had\r\npleased the majority and won the approbation of the people?  M. Corneille\r\ndid not ask for this judgment, and, by the statutes of the Academy, they\r\ncould only sit in judgment upon a work with the consent and at the\r\nentreaty of the author.”  Corneille did not facilitate the task of the\r\nAcademicians: he excused himself modestly, protesting that such\r\noccupation was not worthy of such a body, that a mere piece\r\n(_un libelle_) did not deserve their judgment.  .  .  .  “At length,\r\nunder pressure from M. de Bois-Robert, who gave him pretty plainly to\r\nunderstand what was his master’s desire, this answer slipped from him:\r\n‘The gentlemen of the Academy can do as they please; since you write me\r\nword that my Lord would like to see their judgment, and it would divert\r\nhis Eminence, I have nothing further to say.’”\r\n\r\nThese expressions were taken as a formal consent, and as the Academy\r\nstill excused themselves, “ Let those gentlemen know,” said the cardinal\r\nat last, “that I desire it, and that I shall love them as they love me.”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but to obey.  Whilst Bois-Robert was amusing his\r\nmaster by representing before him a parody of the _Cid,_ played by his\r\nlackeys and scullions, the Academy was at work drawing up their\r\nSentiments respecting the _Cid_.\r\n\r\nThrice submitted to the cardinal, who thrice sent it back with some\r\nstrong remarks appended, the judgment of the Academicians did not succeed\r\nin satisfying the minister.  “What was wanted was the complaisance of\r\nsubmission, what was obtained was only that of gratitude.”  “I know quite\r\nwell,” says Pellisson, “that his Eminence would have wished to have the\r\n_Cid_ more roughly handled, if he had not been adroitly made to\r\nunderstand that a judge must not speak like a party to a suit, and that\r\nin proportion as he showed passion, he would lose authority.”\r\n\r\nBalzac, still in retirement at his country-place, made no mistake as to\r\nthe state of mind either in the Academy or in the world when he wrote to\r\nScudery, who had sent him his _Observations sur le Cid,_ “Reflect, sir,\r\nthat all France takes sides with M. Corneille, and that there is not one,\r\nperhaps, of the judges with whom it is rumored that you have come to an\r\nagreement, who has not praised that which you desire him to condemn; so\r\nthat, though your arguments were incontrovertible and your adversary\r\nshould acquiesce therein, he would still have the wherewith to give\r\nhimself glorious consolation for the loss of his case, and be able to\r\ntell you that it is something more to have delighted a whole kingdom than\r\nto have written a piece according to regulation.  This being so, I doubt\r\nnot that the gentlemen of the Academy will find themselves much hampered\r\nin delivering a judgment on your case, and that, on the one hand, your\r\narguments will stagger them, whilst, on the other, the public approbation\r\nwill keep them in check.  You have the best of it in the closet; he has\r\nthe advantage on the stage.  If the _Cid_ be guilty, it is of a crime\r\nwhich has met with reward; if he be punished, it will be after having\r\ntriumphed; if Plato must banish him from his republic, he must crown him\r\nwith flowers whilst banishing him, and not treat him worse than he\r\nformerly treated Homer.”\r\n\r\nThe Sentiments de l’Academie at last saw the light in the month of\r\nDecember, 1637, and as Chapelain had foreseen, they did not completely\r\nsatisfy either the cardinal or Scudery, in spite of the thanks which the\r\nlatter considered himself bound to express to that body, or Corneille,\r\nwho testified bitter displeasure.  “The Academy proceeds against me with\r\nso much violence, and employs so supreme an authority to close my mouth,\r\nthat all the satisfaction I have is to think that this famous production,\r\nat which so many fine intellects have been working for six months, may no\r\ndoubt be esteemed the opinion of the French Academy, but will probably\r\nnot be the opinion of the rest of Paris.  I wrote the _Cid_ for my\r\ndiversion and that of decent folks who like Comedy.  All the favor that\r\nthe opinion of the Academy can hope for is to make as much way; at any\r\nrate, I have had my account settled before them, and I am not at all sure\r\nthat they can wait for theirs.”\r\n\r\nCorneille did not care to carry his resentment higher than the Academy.\r\nAt the end of December, 1637, when writing to Bois-Robert a letter of\r\nthanks for getting him his pension, which he calls “the liberalities of\r\nmy Lord,” he adds, “As you advise me not to reply to the _Sentiments de\r\nl’Academie,_ seeing what personages are concerned therein, there is no\r\nneed of interpreters to understand that; I am somewhat more of this world\r\nthan Heliodorus was, who preferred to lose his bishopric rather than his\r\nbook; and I prefer my master’s good graces to all the reputations on\r\nearth.  I shall be mum, then, not from disdain, but from respect.”\r\n\r\nThe great Corneille made no further defence he had become a servitor\r\nagain; but the public, less docile, persisted in their opinion.\r\n\r\n          “In vain against the Cid a minister makes league;\r\n          All Paris, gazing on Chimene, thinks with Rodrigue;\r\n          In vain to censure her th’ Academy aspires;\r\n          The stubborn populace revolts and still admires; ”\r\n\r\nsaid Boileau subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe dispute was ended, and, in spite of the judgment of the Academy, the\r\ncardinal did not come out of it victorious; his anger, however, had\r\nceased: the Duchess of Aiguillon, his niece, accepted the dedication of\r\nthe _Cid;_ when _Horace_ appeared, in 1639, the dedicatory epistle,\r\naddressed to the cardinal, proved that Corneille read his works to him\r\nbeforehand; the cabal appeared for a while on the point of making head\r\nagain.  “_Horace,_ condemned by the decemvirs, was acquitted by the\r\npeople,” said Corneille.  The same year _Cinna_ came to give the\r\nfinishing touch to the reputation of the great poet:--\r\n\r\n          “To the persecuted Cid the Cinna owed its birth.”\r\n\r\nCorneille had withdrawn to the obscurity which suited the simplicity of\r\nhis habits; the cardinal, it was said, had helped him to get married; he\r\nhad no longer to defend his works, their fame was amply sufficient.\r\n“Henceforth Corneille walks freely by himself and in the strength of his\r\nown powers; the circle of his ideas grows larger, his style grows loftier\r\nand stronger, together with his thoughts, and purer, perhaps, without his\r\ndreaming of it; a more correct, a more precise expression comes to him,\r\nevoked by greater clearness in idea, greater fixity of sentiment; genius,\r\nwith the mastery of means, seeks new outlets.  Corneille writes\r\n_Polyeucte_.”  [_Corneille et son Temps,_ by M. Guizot.]\r\n\r\nIt was a second revolution accomplished for the upsetting of received\r\nideas, at a time when paganism was to such an extent master of the\r\ntheatre that, in the midst of an allegory of the seventeenth century,\r\nalluding to Gustavus Adolphus and the wars of religion, Richelieu and\r\nDesmarets, in the heroic comedy of _Europe,_ dared not mention the name\r\nof God save in the plural.  Corneille read his piece at the Hotel\r\nRambouillet.  “It was applauded to the extent demanded by propriety and\r\nthe reputation already achieved by the author,” says Fontenelle; “but\r\nsome days afterwards, M. de Voiture went to call upon M. Corneille, and\r\ntook a very delicate way of telling him that _Polyeucte_ had not been so\r\nsuccessful as he supposed, that the Christianism had been extremely\r\ndispleasing.”  “The story is,” adds Voltaire, “that all the Hotel\r\nRambouillet, and especially the Bishop of Vence, Godeau, condemned the\r\nattempt of _Polyeucte_ to overthrow idols.”  Corneille, in alarm, would\r\nhave withdrawn the piece from the hands of the comedians who were\r\nlearning it, and he only left it on the assurance of one of the\r\ncomedians, who did not play in it because he was too bad an actor.\r\nPosterity has justified the poor comedian against the Hotel Rambouillet;\r\namongst so many of Corneille’s masterpieces it has ever given a place\r\napart to _Polyeucte;_ neither the _Saint-Genest_ of Rotrou, nor the\r\n_Zaire_ of Voltaire, in spite of their various beauties, have dethroned\r\n_Polyeucte;_ in fame as well as in date it remains the first of the few\r\npieces in which Christianism appeared, to gain applause, upon the French\r\nclassic stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corneille at the Hotel Rambouillet---342]\r\n\r\nRichelieu was no longer there to lay his commands upon the court and upon\r\nthe world: he was dead, without having been forgiven by Corneille:--\r\n\r\n         “Of our great cardinal let men speak as they will,\r\n          By me, in prose or verse, they shall not be withstood;\r\n          He did me too much good for me to say him ill,\r\n          He did me too much ill for me to say him good!”\r\n\r\nThe great literary movement of the seventeenth century had begun; it had\r\nno longer any need of a protector; it was destined to grow up alone\r\nduring twenty years, amidst troubles at home and wars abroad, to flourish\r\nall at once, with incomparable splendor, under the reign and around the\r\nthrone of Louis XIV.  Cardinal Richelieu, however, had the honor of\r\nprotecting its birth; he had taken personal pleasure in it; he had\r\ncomprehended its importance and beauty; he had desired to serve it whilst\r\ntaking the direction of it.  Let us end, as we began, with the judgment\r\nof La Bruyere: “Compare yourselves, if you dare, with the great\r\nRichelieu, you men devoted to fortune, you who say that you know nothing,\r\nthat you have read nothing, that you will read nothing.  Learn that\r\nCardinal Richelieu did know, did read; I say not that he had no\r\nestrangement from men of letters, but that he loved them, caressed them,\r\nfavored them, that he contrived privileges for them, that he appointed\r\npensions for them, that he united them in a celebrated body, and that he\r\nmade of them the French Academy.”\r\n\r\nThe Academy, the Sorbonne, the Botanic Gardens (_Jardin des Plantes_),\r\nthe King’s Press have endured; the theatre has grown and been enriched by\r\nmany masterpieces, the press has become the most dreaded of powers; all\r\nthe new forces that Richelieu created or foresaw have become developed\r\nwithout him, frequently in opposition to him and to the work of his whole\r\nlife; his name has remained connected with the commencement of all these\r\nwonders, beneficial or disastrous, which he had grasped and presaged, in\r\na future happily concealed from his ken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.----LOUIS XIV., THE FRONDE, AND THE GOVERNMENT OF CARDINAL\r\nMAZARIN.  (1643-1661.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS XIV.----344]\r\n\r\nLouis XIII. had never felt confidence in the queen his wife; and Cardinal\r\nRichelieu had fostered that sentiment which promoted his views.  When M.\r\nde Chavigny came, on Anne of Austria’s behalf, to assure the dying king\r\nthat she had never had any part in the conspiracy of Chalais, or dreamt\r\nof espousing Monsieur in case she was left a widow, Louis XIII.\r\nanswered, “Considering the state I am in, I am bound to forgive her, but\r\nnot to believe her.”  He did not believe her, he never had believed her,\r\nand his declaration touching the Regency was entirely directed towards\r\ncounteracting by anticipation the power intrusted to his wife and his\r\nbrother.  The queen’s regency and the Duke of Orleans’ lieutenant-\r\ngeneralship were in some sort subordinated to a council composed of the\r\nPrince of Conde, Cardinal Mazarin, Chancellor Seguier, Superintendent\r\nBouthillier, and Secretary of State Chavigny, “with a prohibition against\r\nintroducing any change therein, for any cause or on any occasion\r\nwhatsoever.”  The queen and the Duke of Orleans had signed and sworn the\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nKing Louis XIII. was not yet in his grave when his last wishes were\r\nviolated; before his death the queen had made terms with the ministers;\r\nthe course to be followed had been decided.  On the 18th of May, 1643,\r\nthe queen, having brought back the little king to Paris, conducted him in\r\ngreat state to the Parliament of Paris to hold his bed of justice there.\r\nThe boy sat down and said with a good grace that he had come to the\r\nParliament to testify his good will to it, and that his chancellor would\r\nsay the rest.  The Duke of Orleans then addressed the queen.  “The honor\r\nof the regency is the due altogether of your Majesty,” said he, “not only\r\nin your capacity of mother, but also for your merits and virtues; the\r\nregency having been confined to you by the deceased king, and by the\r\nconsent of all the grandees of the realm, I desire no other part in\r\naffairs than that which it may please your Majesty to give me, and I do\r\nnot claim to take any advantage from the special clauses contained in the\r\ndeclaration.”  The Prince of Condo said much the same thing, but with\r\nless earnestness, and on the evening of the same day the queen regent,\r\nhaving sole charge of the administration of affairs, and modifying the\r\ncouncil at her pleasure, announced to the astounded court that she should\r\nretain by her Cardinal Mazarin.  Not a word had been said about him at\r\nthe Parliament; the courtiers believed that he was on the point of\r\nleaving France; but the able Italian, attractive as he was subtle, had\r\nalready found a way to please the queen.  She retained as chief of her\r\ncouncil the heir to the traditions of Richelieu, and deceived the hopes\r\nof the party of Importants, those meddlers of the court at whose head\r\nmarched the Duke of Beaufort, all puffed up with the confidence lately\r\nshown to him by her Majesty.  Potier, Bishop of Beauvais, the queen’s\r\nconfidant during her troubles, “expected to be all-powerful in the state;\r\nhe sought out the Duke of Orleans and the Prince of  Conde, promising\r\nthem governorships of places, and, generally, anything they might desire.\r\nHe thought he could set the affairs of state going as easily as he could\r\nhis parish-priests; but the poor prelate came down from his high hopes\r\nwhen he saw that the cardinal was advancing more and more in the queen’s\r\nconfidence, and that, for him, too much was already thought to have been\r\ndone in according him admittance to the council, whilst flattering him\r\nwith a hope of the purple.” [_Memoires de Brienne,_ ii. 37.]\r\n\r\nCardinal Mazarin soon sent him off to his diocese.  Continuing to humor\r\nall parties, and displaying foresight and prudence, the new minister was\r\neven now master.  Louis XIII., without any personal liking, had been\r\nfaithful to Richelieu to the death; with different feelings, Anne of\r\nAustria was to testify the same constancy towards Mazarin.\r\n\r\nA stroke of fortune came at the very first to strengthen the regent’s\r\nposition.  Since the death of Cardinal Richelieu, the Spaniards, but\r\nrecently overwhelmed at the close df 1642, had recovered courage and\r\nboldness; new counsels prevailed at the court of Philip IV., who had\r\ndismissed Olivarez; the house of Austria vigorously resumed the\r\noffensive; at the moment of Louis XIII.’s death, Don Francisco de Mello,\r\ngovernor of the Low Countries, had just invaded French territory by way\r\nof the Ardennes, and laid siege to Rocroi, on the 12th of May.  The\r\nFrench army was commanded by the young Duke of Enghien, the Prince of\r\nConde’s son, scarcely twenty-two years old; Louis XIII. had given him as\r\nhis lieutenant and director the veteran Marshal de l’Hopital; and the\r\nlatter feared to give battle.  The Duke of Enghien, who “was dying with\r\nimpatience to enter the enemy’s country, resolved to accomplish by\r\naddress what he could not carry by authority.  He opened his heart to\r\nGassion alone.  As he was a man who saw nothing but what was easy even in\r\nthe most dangerous deeds, he had very soon brought matters to the point\r\nthat the prince desired.  Marshal de l’Hopital found himself\r\nimperceptibly so near the Spaniards that it was impossible for him any\r\nlonger to hinder an engagement.”  [_Relation de 31 de la Houssaye._] The\r\narmy was in front of Rocroi, and out of the dangerous defile which led to\r\nthe place, without any idea on the part of the marshal and the army that\r\nLouis XIII. was dead.  The Duke of Enghien, who had received the news,\r\nhad kept it secret.  He had merely said in the tone of a master “that he\r\nmeant to fight, and would answer for the issue.  His orders given, he\r\npassed along the ranks of his army with an air which communicated to it\r\nthe same impatience that he himself felt to see the night over, in order\r\nto begin the battle.  He passed the whole of it at the camp-fire of the\r\nofficers of Picardy.”  In the morning “it was necessary to rouse from\r\ndeep slumber this second Alexander.  Mark him as he flies to victory or\r\ndeath!  As soon as he had kindled from rank to rank the ardor with which\r\nhe was animated, he was seen, in almost the same moment, driving in the\r\nenemy’s right, supporting ours that wavered, rallying the half-beaten\r\nFrench, putting to flight the victorious Spaniards, striking terror\r\neverywhere, and dumbfounding with his flashing looks those who escaped\r\nfrom his blows.  There remained that dread infantry of the army of Spain,\r\nwhose huge battalions, in close order, like so many towers, but towers\r\nthat could repair their breaches, remained unshaken amidst all the rest\r\nof the rout, and delivered their fire on all sides.  Thrice the young\r\nconqueror tried to break these fearless warriors; thrice he was driven\r\nknack by the valiant Count of Fuentes, who was seen carried about in his\r\nchair, and, in spite of his infirmities, showing that a warrior’s soul is\r\nmistress of the body it animates.  But yield they must: in vain through\r\nthe woods, with his cavalry all fresh, does Beck rush down to fall upon\r\nour exhausted men the prince has been beforehand with him; the broken\r\nbattalions cry for quarter, but the victory is to be more terrible than\r\nthe fight for the Duke of Enghien.  Whilst with easy mien he advances to\r\nreceive the parole of these brave fellows, they, watchful still,\r\napprehend the surprise of a fresh attack; their terrible volley drives\r\nour men mad; there is nothing to be seen but slaughter; the soldier is\r\ndrunk with blood, till that great prince, who could not bear to see such\r\nlions butchered like so many sheep, calmed excited passions, and to the\r\npleasure of victory joined that of mercy.  He would willingly have saved\r\nthe life of the brave Count of Fuentes, but found him lying amidst\r\nthousands of the dead whose loss is still felt by Spain.  The prince\r\nbends the knee, and, on the field of battle, renders thanks to the God of\r\narmies for the victory he hath given him.  Then were there rejoicings\r\nover Rocroi delivered, the threats of a dread enemy converted to their\r\nshame, the regency strengthened, France at rest, and a reign, which was\r\nto be so noble, commenced with such happy augury.”  [Bossuet, _Oraison\r\nfunebre de Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Conde._]  Victory or death, below\r\nthe cross of Burgundy, was borne upon most of the standards taken from\r\nthe Imperialists; and “indeed,” says the Gazette de France, “the most\r\npart were found dead in the ranks where they had been posted.  Which was\r\nnobly brought home by one of the prisoners to our captains when, being\r\nasked how many there had been of them, he replied, “Count the dead.”\r\n Conde was worthy to fight such enemies, and Bossuet to recount their\r\ndefeat.  “The prince was a born captain,” said Cardinal de Retz.  And all\r\nFrance said so with him, on hearing of the victory of Rocroi.\r\n\r\nThe delight was all the keener in the queen’s circle, because the house\r\nof Conde openly supported Cardinal Mazarin, bitterly attacked as he was\r\nby the Importants, who accused him of reviving the tyranny of Richelieu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Great Conde----348]\r\n\r\nA ditty on the subject was current in the streets of Paris:--\r\n\r\n          “He is not dead, he is but changed of age,\r\n          The cardinal, at whom men gird with rage,\r\n          But all his household make thereat great cheer;\r\n          It pleaseth not full many a chevalier\r\n          They fain had brought him to the lowest stage.\r\n          Beneath his wing came all his lineage,\r\n          By the same art whereof he made usage\r\n          And, by my faith, ‘tis still their day, I fear.\r\n                         He is not dead.\r\n\r\n          “Hush! we are mum, because we dread the cage\r\n          For he’s at court--this eminent personage\r\n          There to remain of years to come a score.\r\n          Ask those Importants, would you fain know more\r\n          And they will say in dolorous language,\r\n                        ‘He is not dead.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, on pretext offered by a feminine quarrel between the young\r\nDuchess of Longueville, daughter of the Prince of Conde, and the Duchess\r\nof Montbazon, the Duke of Beaufort and some of his friends resolved to\r\nassassinate the cardinal.  The attempt was a failure, but the Duke of\r\nBeaufort, who was arrested on the 2d of September, was taken to the\r\ncastle of Vincennes.  Madame de Chevreuse, recently returned to court,\r\nwhere she would fain have exacted from the queen the reward for her\r\nservices and her past sufferings, was sent into exile, as well as the\r\nDuke of Vendome.  Madame d’Hautefort, but lately summoned by Anne of\r\nAustria to be near her, was soon involved in the same disgrace.  Proud\r\nand compassionate, without any liking for Mazarin, she was daring enough,\r\nduring a trip to Vincennes, to ask pardon for the Duke of Beaufort.\r\n“The queen made no answer, and, the collation being served, Madame\r\nd’Hautefort, whose heart was full, ate nothing; when she was asked why,\r\nshe declared that she could not enjoy anything in such close proximity to\r\nthat poor boy.”  The queen could not put up with reproaches; and she\r\nbehaved with extreme coldness to Madame d’Hautefort.  One day, at\r\nbedtime, her ill temper showed itself so plainly, that the old favorite\r\ncould no longer be in doubt about the queen’s sentiments.  As she softly\r\nclosed the curtains, “I do assure you, Madame,” she said, “that if I had\r\nserved God with as much attachment and devotion as I have your Majesty\r\nall my life, I should be a great saint.”  And, raising her eyes to the\r\ncrucifix, she added, “Thou knowest, Lord, what I have done for her.”  The\r\nqueen let her go to the convent where Mademoiselle de la Fayette had\r\ntaken refuge ten years before.  Madame d’Hautefort left it ere long to\r\nbecome the wife of Marshal Schomberg; but the party of the Importants was\r\ndead, and the power of Cardinal Mazarin seemed to be firmly established.\r\n“It was not the thing just then for any decent man to be on bad terms\r\nwith the court,” says Cardinal de Retz.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for a general peace, the preliminaries whereof had been\r\nsigned by King Louis XIII. in 1641, had been going on since 1644 at\r\nMunster and at Osnabriick, without having produced any result; the Duke\r\nof Enghien, who became Prince of  Conde in 1646, was keeping up the war\r\nin Flanders and Germany, with the co-operation of Viscount Turenne,\r\nyounger brother of the Duke of Bouillon, and, since Rocroi, a marshal of\r\nFrance.  The capture of Thionville and of Dunkerque, the victories of\r\nFriburg and Nordlingen, the skilful opening effected in Germany as far as\r\nAugsburg by the French and the Swedes, had raised so high the reputation\r\nof the two generals, that the Prince of  Conde, who was haughty and\r\nambitious, began to cause great umbrage to Mazarin.  Fear of having him\r\nunoccupied deterred the cardinal from peace, and made all the harder the\r\nconditions he presumed to impose upon the Spaniards.  Meanwhile the\r\nUnited Provinces, weary of a war which fettered their commerce, and\r\nskilfully courted by their old masters, had just concluded a private\r\ntreaty with Spain; the emperor was trying, but to no purpose, to detach\r\nthe Swedes likewise from the French alliance, when the victory of Lens,\r\ngained on the 20th of August, 1648, over Archduke Leopold and General\r\nBeck, came to throw into the balance the weight of a success as splendid\r\nas it was unexpected; one more campaign, and Turenne might be threatening\r\nVienna whilst Conde entered Brussels; the emperor saw there was no help\r\nfor it, and bent his head.  The house of Austria split in two; Spain\r\nstill refused to treat with France, but the whole of Germany clamored for\r\npeace; the conditions of it were at last drawn up at Munster by MM.\r\nServien and de Lionne; M. d’Avaux, the most able diplomatist that France\r\npossessed, had been recalled to Paris at the beginning of the year.  On\r\nthe 24th of October, 1648, after four years of negotiation, France at\r\nlast had secured to her Elsass and the three bishoprics of Metz, Toul,\r\nand Verdun; Sweden gained Western Pomerania, including Stettin, the Isle\r\nof Rugen, the three mouths of the Oder, and the bishoprics of Bremen and\r\nWerden, thus becoming a German power: as for Germany, she had won liberty\r\nof conscience and political liberty; the rights of the Lutheran or\r\nreformed Protestants were equalized with those of Catholics; henceforth\r\nthe consent of a free assembly of all the Estates of the empire was\r\nnecessary to make laws, raise soldiers, impose taxes, and decide peace or\r\nwar.  The peace of Westphalia put an end at one and the same time to the\r\nThirty Years’ War and to the supremacy of the house of Austria in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nSo much glory and so many military or diplomatic successes cost dear;\r\nFrance was crushed by imposts, and the finances were discovered to be in\r\nutter disorder; the superintendent, D’Emery, an able and experienced man,\r\nwas so justly discredited that his measures were, as a foregone\r\nconclusion, unpopular; an edict laying octroi or tariff on the entry of\r\nprovisions into the city of Paris irritated the burgesses, and Parliament\r\nrefused to enregister it.  For some time past the Parliament, which had\r\nbeen kept down by the iron hand of Richelieu, had perceived that it had\r\nto do with nothing more than an able man, and not a master; it began to\r\nhold up its head again; a union was proposed between the four sovereign\r\ncourts of Paris, to wit, the Parliament, the grand council, the chamber\r\nof exchequer, and the court of aids or indirect taxes; the queen quashed\r\nthe deed of union; the magistrates set her at nought; the queen yielded,\r\nauthorizing the delegates to deliberate in the chamber of St. Louis at\r\nthe Palace of Justice; the pretensions of the Parliament were exorbitant,\r\nand aimed at nothing short of resuming, in the affairs of the state, the\r\nposition from which Richelieu had deposed it; the concessions which\r\nCardinal Mazarin with difficulty wrung from the queen augmented the\r\nParliament’s demands.  Anne of Austria was beginning to lose patience,\r\nwhen the news of the victory of Lens restored courage to the court.\r\n“Parliament will be very sorry,” said the little king, on hearing of the\r\nPrince of Conde’s success.  The grave assemblage, on the 26th of August,\r\nwas issuing from Notre Dame, where a Te Deum had just been sung, when\r\nCouncillor Broussel and President Blancmesnil were arrested in their\r\nhouses, and taken one to St. Germain and the other to Vincennes.  This\r\nwas a familiar proceeding on the part of royal authority in its\r\ndisagreements with the Parliament.  Anne of Austria herself had practised\r\nit four years before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arrest of Broussel----352]\r\n\r\nIt was a mistake on the part of Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin\r\nnot to have considered the different condition of the public mind.\r\nA suppressed excitement had for some months been hatching in Paris and in\r\nthe provinces.  “The Parliament growled over the tariff-edict,” says\r\nCardinal de Retz; “and no sooner had it muttered than everybody awoke.\r\nPeople went groping as it were after the laws; they were no longer to be\r\nfound.  Under the influence of this agitation the people entered the\r\nsanctuary and lifted the veil that ought always to conceal whatever can\r\nbe said about the right of peoples and that of kings, which never accord\r\nso well as in silence.”  The arrest of Broussel, an old man in high\r\nesteem, very keen in his opposition to the court, was like fire to flax.\r\n“There was a blaze at once, a sensation, a rush, an outcry, and a\r\nshutting up of shops.”  Paul de Gondi, known afterwards as Cardinal de\r\nRetz, was at that time coadjutor of the Archbishop of Paris, his uncle\r\nwitty, debauched, bold, and restless, lately compromised in the plots of\r\nthe Count of Soissons against Cardinal Richelieu, he owed his office to\r\nthe queen, and “did not hesitate,” he says, “to repair to her, that he\r\nmight stick to his duty above all things.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cardinal de Retz----352]\r\n\r\nThere was already a great tumult in the streets when he arrived at the\r\nPalais-Royal: the people were shouting, “Broussel!  Broussel!”  The\r\ncoadjutor was accompanied by Marshal la Meilleraye; and both of them\r\nreported the excitement amongst the people.  The queen grew angry.\r\n“There is revolt in imagining that there can be revolt,” she said: “these\r\nare the ridiculous stories of those who desire it; the king’s authority\r\nwill soon restore order.”  Then, as old M. de Guitaut, who had just come\r\nin, supported the coadjutor, and said that he did not understand how\r\nanybody could sleep in the state in which things were, the cardinal asked\r\nhim, with some slight irony, “Well, M. de Guitaut, and what is your\r\nadvice?”  “My advice,” said Guitaut, “is to give up that old rascal of a\r\nBroussel, dead or alive.”  “The former,” replied the coadjutor, “would\r\nnot accord with either the queen’s piety or her prudence; the latter\r\nmight stop the tumult.”  At this word the queen blushed, and exclaimed,\r\n“I understand you, Mr. Coadjutor; you would have me set Broussel at\r\nliberty.  I would strangle him with these hands first!”  “And, as she\r\nfinished the last syllable, she put them close to my face,” says De Retz,\r\n“adding, ‘And those who .  .  .  ‘ The cardinal advanced and whispered in\r\nher ear.”  Advices of a more and more threatening character continued to\r\narrive; and, at last, it was resolved to promise that Broussel should be\r\nset at liberty, provided that the people dispersed and ceased to demand\r\nit tumultuously.  The coadjutor was charged to proclaim this concession\r\nthroughout Paris; he asked for a regular order, but was not listened to.\r\n“The queen had retired to her little gray room.  Monsignor pushed me very\r\ngently with his two hands, saying, ‘Restore the peace of the realm.’\r\nMarshal Meilleraye drew me along, and so I went out with my rochet and\r\ncamail, bestowing benedictions right and left; but this occupation did\r\nnot prevent me from making all the reflections suitable to the difficulty\r\nin which I found myself.  The impetuosity of Marshal Meilleraye did not\r\ngive me opportunity to weigh my expressions; he advanced sword in hand,\r\nshouting with all his might, ‘Hurrah for the king!  Liberation for\r\nBroussel!’  As he was seen by many more folks than heard him, he provoked\r\nwith his sword far more people than he appeased with his voice.”  The\r\ntumult increased; there was a rush to arms on all sides; the coadjutor\r\nwas felled to the ground by a blow from a stone.  He had just picked\r\nhimself up, when a burgess put his musket to his head.  “Though I did not\r\nknow him a bit,” says Retz, “I thought it would not be well to let him\r\nsuppose so at such a moment; on the contrary, I said to him, ‘Ah!\r\nwretch, if thy father saw thee!’  He thought I was the best friend of his\r\nfather, on whom, however, I had never set eyes.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Ah, Wretch, if thy Father saw thee!”----354]\r\n\r\nThe coadjutor was recognized, and the crowd pressed round him, dragging\r\nhim to the market-place.  He kept repeating everywhere that “the queen\r\npromised to restore Broussel.”  The fiippers laid down their arms, and\r\nthirty or forty thousand men accompanied him to the Palais-Royal.\r\n“Madame,” said Marshal Meilleraye as he entered, “here is he to whom I\r\nowe my life, and your Majesty the safety of the Palais-Royal.”  The queen\r\nbegan to smile.  “The marshal flew into a passion, and said with an oath,\r\n‘Madame, no proper man can venture to flatter you in the state in which\r\nthings are; and if you do not this very day set Broussel at liberty,\r\nto-morrow there will not be left one stone upon another in Paris.’  I\r\nwished to speak in support of what the marshal said, but the queen cut\r\nme short, saying, with an air of raillery, ‘Go and rest yourself, sir;\r\nyou have worked very hard.’”\r\n\r\nThe coadjutor left the Palais-Royal “in what is called a rage;” and he\r\nwas in a greater one in the evening, when his friends came and told him\r\nthat he was being made fun of at the queen’s supper-table; that she was\r\nconvinced that he had done all he could to increase the tumult; that he\r\nwould be the first to be made a great example of; and that the Parliament\r\nwas about to be interdicted.  Paul de Gondi had not waited for their\r\ninformation to think of revolt.  “I did not reflect as to what I could\r\ndo,” says he, “for I was quite certain of that; I reflected only as to\r\nwhat I ought to do, and I was perplexed.”  The jests and the threats of\r\nthe court appeared to him to be sufficient justification.  “What\r\neffectually stopped my scruples was the advantage I imagined I had in\r\ndistinguishing myself from those of my profession by a state of life in\r\nwhich there was something of all professions.  In disorderly times,\r\nthings lead to a confusion of species, and the vices of an archbishop\r\nmay, in an infinity of conjunctures, be the virtues of a party leader.”\r\n The coadjutor recalled his friends.  “We are not in such bad case as you\r\nsupposed, gentlemen,” he said to them; “there is an intention of crushing\r\nthe public; it is for me to defend it from oppression; to-morrow before\r\nmidday I shall be master of Paris.”\r\n\r\nFor some time past the coadjutor had been laboring to make himself\r\npopular in Paris; the general excitement was only waiting to break out,\r\nand when the chancellor’s carriage appeared in the streets in the\r\nmorning, on the way to the Palace of Justice, the people, secretly worked\r\nupon during the night, all at once took up arms again.  The chancellor\r\nhad scarcely time to seek refuge in the Hotel de Luynes; the mob rushed\r\nin after him, pillaging and destroying the furniture, whilst the\r\nchancellor, flying for refuge into a small chamber, and believing his\r\nlast hour had come, was confessing to his brother, the Bishop of Meaux.\r\nHe was not discovered, and the crowd moved off in another direction.  “It\r\nwas like a sudden and violent conflagration lighted up from the Pont Neuf\r\nover the whole city.  Everybody without exception took up arms.  Children\r\nof five and six years of age were seen dagger in hand; and the mothers\r\nthemselves carried them.  In less than two hours there were in Paris more\r\nthan two hundred barricades, bordered with flags and all the arms that\r\nthe League had left entire.  Everybody cried, ‘Hurrah! for the king!’ but\r\necho answered, ‘None of your Mazarin!’”\r\n\r\nThe coadjutor kept himself shut up at home, protesting his powerlessness;\r\nthe Parliament had met at an early hour; the Palace of Justice was\r\nsurrounded by an immense crowd, shouting, “Broussel!  Broussel!”  The\r\nParliament resolved to go in a body and demand of the queen the release\r\nof their members arrested the day before.  “We set out in full court,”\r\n says the premier president Mole, “without sending, as the custom is, to\r\nask the queen to appoint a time, the ushers in front, with their square\r\ncaps and a-foot: from this spot as far as the Trahoir cross we found the\r\npeople in arms and barricades thrown up at every hundred paces.”\r\n [_Memoires de Matthieu Mole,_ iii.  p. 255.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: President Mole----355]\r\n\r\n“If it were not blasphemy to say that there was any one in our age more\r\nintrepid than the great Gustavus and the Prince, I should say it was M.\r\nMole, premier president,” writes Cardinal de Retz.  Sincerely devoted to\r\nthe public weal, and a magistrate to the very bottom of his soul, Mole,\r\nnevertheless, inclined towards the side of power, and understood better\r\nthan his brethren the danger of factions.  He represented to the queen\r\nthe extreme danger the sedition was causing to Paris and to France.\r\n“She, who feared nothing because she knew but little, flew into a passion\r\nand answered, furiously, ‘I am quite aware that there is disturbance in\r\nthe city, but you shall answer to me for it, gentlemen of the Parliament,\r\nyou, your wives, and your children.’”  “The queen was pleased,” says\r\nMole, in his dignified language, “to signify in terms of wrath that the\r\nmagisterial body should be answerable for the evils which might ensue,\r\nand which the king on reaching his majority would remember.”\r\n\r\nThe queen had retired to her room, slamming the door violently; the\r\nParliament turned back to the Palace of Justice; the angry mob thronged\r\nabout the magistrates; when they arrived at Rue St. Honore, just as they\r\nwere about to turn on to the Pont Neuf, a band of armed men fell upon\r\nthem, “and a cookshop-lad, advancing at the head of two hundred men,\r\nthrust his halbert against the premier president’s stomach, saying,\r\n‘Turn, traitor, and, if thou wouldst not thyself be slain, give up to us\r\nBroussel, or Mazarin and the chancellor as hostages.’”  Matthew Mole\r\nquietly put the weapon aside, and, “You forget yourself,” he said, “and\r\nare oblivious of the respect you owe to my office.”  “Thrice an effort\r\nwas made.to thrust me into a private house,” says his account in his\r\nMemoires, “but I still kept my place; and, attempts having been made with\r\nswords and pistols on all sides of me to make an end of me, God would not\r\npermit it, some of the members (Messieurs) and some true friends having\r\nplaced themselves in front of me.  I told President de Mesmes that there\r\nwas no other plan but to return to the Palais-Royal and thither take back\r\nthe body, which was much diminished in numbers, five of the presidents\r\nhaving dropped away, and also many of the members on whom the people had\r\ninflicted unworthy treatment.”  “Thus having given himself time to rally\r\nas many as he could of the body, and still preserving the dignity of the\r\nmagistracy both in his words and in his movements, the premier president\r\nreturned at a slow pace to the Palais-Royal, amidst a running fire of\r\ninsults, threats, execrations, and blasphemies.”  [_Memoires de Retz._]\r\n\r\nThe whole court had assembled in the gallery: Mole spoke first.  “This\r\nman,” says Retz, “had a sort of eloquence peculiar to himself.  He knew\r\nnothing of apostrophes, he was not correct in his language, but he spoke\r\nwith a force which made up for all that, and he was naturally so bold\r\nthat he never spoke so well as in the midst of peril.  Monsieur made as\r\nif he would throw himself on his knees before the queen, who remained\r\ninflexible; four or five princesses, who were trembling with fear, did\r\nthrow themselves at her feet; the Queen of England, who had come that day\r\nfrom St. Germain, represented that the troubles had never been so serious\r\nat their commencement in England, nor the feelings so heated or united.”\r\n [_Histoire du Temps,_ 1647-48.  (_Archives curieuses,_ vi. p. 162.)]  At\r\nlast the cardinal made up his mind; he “had been roughly handled in the\r\nqueen’s presence by the presidents and councillors in their speeches,\r\nsome of them telling him, in mockery, that he had only to give himself\r\nthe trouble of going as far as the Pont Neuf to see for himself the state\r\nin which things were,” and he joined with all those present in entreating\r\nAnne of Austria; finally, the release of Broussel was extorted from her,\r\n“not without a deep sigh, which showed what violence she did her feelings\r\nin the struggle.”\r\n\r\n“We returned in full court by the same road,” says Matthew Mole, “and the\r\npeople demanding, with confused clamor of voices, whether M. Broussel\r\nwere at liberty, we gave them assurances thereof, and entered by the\r\nback-door of my lodging; before crossing the threshold, I took leave of\r\nPresidents De Mesmes and Le Coigneux, and waited until the members had\r\npassed, testifying my sentiments of gratitude for that they had been\r\nunwilling to separate until they had seen to the security of my person,\r\nwhich I had not at all deserved, but such was their good pleasure.  After\r\nthis business, which had lasted from six in the morning until seven\r\no’clock, there was need of rest, seeing that the mind had been agitated\r\namidst so many incidents, and not a morsel had been tasted.”  [_Memoires\r\nde Matthieu Mole,_ t. iii.  p. 265.]\r\n\r\nBroussel had taken his seat in the Parliament again.  The Prince of Conde\r\nhad just arrived in Paris; he did not like the cardinal, but he was angry\r\nwith the Parliament, which he considered imprudent and insolent.  “They\r\nare going ahead,” said he:--“if I were to go ahead with them, I should\r\nperhaps do better for my own interests, but my name is Louis de Bourbon,\r\nand I do not wish to shake the throne; these devils of squarecaps, are\r\nthey mad about bringing me either to commence a civil war before long, or\r\nto put a rope round their own necks, and place over their heads and over\r\nmy own an adventurer from Sicily, who will be the ruin of us all in the\r\nend?  I will let the Parliament plainly see that they are not where they\r\nsuppose, and that it would not be a hard matter to bring them to reason.”\r\n The coadjutor, to whom he thus expressed himself, answered that “the\r\ncardinal might possibly be mistaken in his measures, and that Paris would\r\nbe a hard nut to crack.”  Whereupon the prince rejoined, angrily, “It\r\nwill not be taken, like Dunkerque, by mining and assaults, but if the\r\nbread of Gonesse were to fail them for a week .  .  .”  The coadjutor\r\ntook the rest as said.  Some days afterwards, during the night between\r\nthe 5th and 6th of January, 1649, the queen, with the little king and the\r\nwhole court, set out at four A. M. from Paris for the castle of St.\r\nGermain, empty, unfurnished, as was then the custom in the king’s\r\nabsence, where the courtiers had great difficulty in finding a bundle of\r\nstraw.  “The queen had scarcely a bed to lie upon,” says Mdlle. de\r\nMontpensier, “but never did I see any creature so gay as she was that\r\nday; had she won a battle, taken Paris, and had all who had displeased\r\nher hanged, she could not have been more so, and nevertheless she was\r\nvery far from all that.”\r\n\r\nParis was left to the malcontents; everybody was singing,\r\n\r\n               “A Fronde-ly wind\r\n                Got up to-day,\r\n               ‘Gainst Mazarin\r\n                It howls, they say.”\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January the Parliament of Paris, all the chambers in\r\nassembly, issued a decree whereby Cardinal Mazarin was declared an enemy\r\nto the king and the state, and a disturber of the public peace, and\r\ninjunctions were laid upon all subjects of the king to hunt him down; war\r\nwas declared.\r\n\r\nScarcely had it begun, when the greatest lords came flocking to the\r\npopular side.  On the departure of the court for St. Germain, the Duchess\r\nof Longueville had remained in Paris; her husband and her brother the\r\nPrince of Conti were not slow in coming to look after her; and already\r\nthe Duke of Elbeuf, of the house of Lorraine, had offered his services to\r\nthe Parliament.  Levies of troops were beginning in the city, and the\r\ncommand of the forces was offered to the Prince of Conti; the Dukes of\r\nBouillon and Beaufort and Marshal de la Mothe likewise embraced the party\r\nof revolt; the Duchesses of Longueville and Bouillon established\r\nthemselves with their children at the Hotel de Ville as hostages given by\r\nthe Fronde of princes to the Fronde of the people; the Parliaments of Aix\r\nand Rouen made common cause with that of Paris; a decree ordered the\r\nseizure, in all the exchequers of the kingdom, of the royal moneys, in\r\norder that they might be employed for the general defence.  Every evening\r\nParis wore a festive air; there was dancing at the Hotel de Ville, and\r\nthe gentlemen who had been skirmishing during the day around the walls\r\ncame for recreation in the society of the princesses.  “This commingling\r\nof blue scarfs, of ladies, of cuirasses, of violins in the hall, and of\r\ntrumpets in the square, offered a spectacle which is oftener seen in\r\nromances than elsewhere.”  [_Memoires du Cardinal de Retz,_ t. i.]\r\nAffairs of gallantry were mixed up with the most serious resolves; Madame\r\nde Longueville was of the Fronde because she was in love with M. de\r\nMarsillac (afterwards Duke of La Rochefoucauld), and he was on bad terms\r\nwith Cardinal Mazarin.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile war was rumbling round Paris; the post of Charenton, fortified\r\nby the Frondeurs, had been carried by the Prince of Conde at the head of\r\nthe king’s troops; the Parliament was beginning to perceive its mistake,\r\nand desired to have peace again, but the great lords engaged in the\r\ncontest aspired to turn it to account; they had already caused the gates\r\nof Paris to be closed against a herald sent by the queen to recall her\r\nsubjects to their duty; they were awaiting the army of Germany, commanded\r\nby M. de Tnrenne, whom his brother, the Duke of Bouillon, had drawn into\r\nhis culpable enterprise; nay, more, they had begun to negotiate with\r\nSpain, and they brought up to the Parliament a pretended envoy from\r\nArchduke Leopold, but the court refused to receive him.  “What! sir,”\r\n said President de Mesmes, turning to the Prince of Conti, “is it possible\r\nthat a prince of the blood of France should propose to give a seat upon\r\nthe fleurs-de-lis to a deputy from the most cruel enemy of the\r\nfleurs-de-lis?”\r\n\r\nThe Parliament sent a deputation to the queen, and conferences were\r\nopened at Ruel on the 4th of March;.  the great lords of the Fronde took\r\nno part in it; “they contented themselves with having at St. Germain\r\nlow-voiced (a basses notes)--secret agents,” says Madame de Motteville,\r\n“commissioned to negotiate in their favor.”  Paris was beginning to lack\r\nbread; it was festival-time, and want began to make itself felt; a\r\n“complaint of the Carnival” was current amongst the people:--\r\n\r\n               “In my extreme affliction, yet\r\n               I can this consolation get,\r\n               That, at his hands, my enemy,\r\n               Old Lent, will fare the same as I:\r\n               That, at the times when people eat,\r\n               We both shall equal worship meet.\r\n               Thus, joining with the whole of France\r\n               In war against him _a outrance,_\r\n               Grim Lent and festive Carnival,\r\n               Will fight against the cardinal.”\r\n\r\nIt was against the cardinal, in fact, that all attacks were directed, but\r\nthe queen remained immovable in her fidelity.  “I should be afraid,” she\r\nsaid to Madame de Motteville, “that, if I were to let him fall, the same\r\nthing would happen to me that happened to the King of England (Charles I.\r\nhad just been executed), and that, after he had been driven out, my turn\r\nwould come.”  Grain had found its way into Paris during the truce; and\r\nwhen, on the 13th of March, the premier president, Molt;, and the other\r\nnegotiators, returned to Paris, bringing the peace which they had signed\r\nat Ruel, they were greeted with furious shouts: “None of your peace!\r\nNone of your Mazarin!  We must go to St.  Germain to seek our good king!\r\nWe must fling into the river all the Mazarins!”  A rioter had just laid\r\nhis hand on the premier president’s arm.  “When you have killed me,” said\r\nthe latter, calmly, “I shall only want six feet of earth;” and, when he\r\nwas advised to get back into his house by way of the record-offices, “The\r\ncourt never hides itself,” he said; “if I were certain to perish, I would\r\nnot commit this poltroonery, which, moreover, would but serve to give\r\ncourage to the rioters.  They would, of course, come after me to my house\r\nif they thought that I shrank from them here.”  The deputies of the\r\nParliament were sent back to Ruel, taking a statement of the claims of\r\nthe great lords: “according to their memorials, they demanded the whole\r\nof France.”  [_Memoires de Madame de Motteville,_ t. iii.  p. 247.]\r\n\r\nWhilst Paris was in disorder, and the agitation, through its example, was\r\nspreading over almost the whole of France, M. de Turenne, obliged to fly\r\nfrom his army, was taking refuge, he and five others, with the landgrave\r\nof Hesse; his troops had refused to follow him in revolt; the last hope\r\nof the Frondeurs was slipping from them.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves obliged to accept peace, not without obtaining some\r\nfavors from the court.\r\n\r\nThere was a general amnesty; and the Parliament preserved all its rights.\r\n“The king will have the honor of it, and we the profit,” said Guy-Patin.\r\nThe great lords reappeared one after another at St. Germain.  “It is the\r\nway of our nation to return to their duty with the same airiness with\r\nwhich they depart from it, and to pass in a single instant from rebellion\r\nto obedience.”  [_La Rochefoucauld._]  The return to rebellion was not to\r\nbe long delayed.  The queen had gone back to Paris, and the Prince of\r\nConde with her; he, proud of having beaten the parliamentary Fronde,\r\naffected the conqueror’s airs, and the throng of his courtiers, the\r\n“petits maitres,” as they were called, spoke very slightingly of the\r\ncardinal.   Conde, reconciled with the Duchess of Longueville, his\r\nsister, and his brother, the Prince of Conti, assumed to have the lion’s\r\nshare in the government, and claimed all the favors for himself or his\r\nfriends; the Fondeurs made skilful use of the ill-humor which this\r\nconduct excited in Cardinal Mazarin; the minister responded to their\r\nadvances; the coadjutor was secretly summoned to the Louvre; the dowager\r\nPrincess of  Conde felt some apprehensions; but, “What have I to fear?”\r\n her son said to her; “the cardinal is my friend.”  “I doubt it,” she\r\nanswered.  “You are wrong; I rely upon him as much as upon you.”  “Please\r\nGod you may not be mistaken!” replied the princess, who was setting out\r\nfor the Palais-Royal to see the queen, said to be indisposed that day.\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria was upon her bed; word was brought to her that the\r\ncouncil was waiting; this was the moment agreed upon; she dismissed the\r\nprincess, shut herself up in her oratory with the little king, to whom\r\nshe gave an account of what was going to be done for his service; then,\r\nmaking him kneel down, she joined him in praying to God for the success\r\nof this great enterprise.  As the Prince of  Conde arrived in the grand\r\ngallery, he saw Guitaut, captain of the guards, coming towards him; at\r\nthe same instant, through a door at the bottom, out went the cardinal,\r\ntaking with him Abbe de la Riviere, who was the usual confidant of the\r\nDuke of Orleans, but from whom his master had concealed the great secret.\r\nThe prince supppsed that Guitaut was coming to ask him some favor; the\r\ncaptain of the guards said in his ear, “My lord, what I want to say is,\r\nthat I have orders to arrest you, you, the Prince of Conti your brother,\r\nand M. de Longueville.”  “Me, M. Guitaut, arrest me?”  Then, reflecting\r\nfor a moment, “In God’s name,” he said, “go back to the queen and tell\r\nher that I entreat her to let me have speech of her!”  Guitaut went to\r\nher, whilst the prince, returning to those who were waiting for him,\r\nsaid, “Gentlemen, the queen orders my arrest, and yours too, brother, and\r\nyours too, M. de Longueville; I confess that I am astonished, I who have\r\nalways served the king so well, and believed myself secure of the\r\ncardinal’s friendship.”  The chancellor, who was not in the secret,\r\ndeclared that it was Guitaut’s pleasantry.  “Go and seek the queen then,”\r\n said the prince, “and tell her of the pleasantry that is going on; as for\r\nme, I hold it to be very certain that I am arrested.”  The chancellor\r\nwent out, and did not return.  M. Servien, who had gone to speak to the\r\ncardinal, likewise did not appear again.  M. de Guitaut entered alone.\r\n“The queen cannot see you, my lord,” he said.  “Very well; I am content;\r\nlet us obey,” answered the prince: “but whither are you going to take us?\r\nI pray you let it be to a warm place.”  “We are going to the wood of\r\nVincennes, my lord,” said Guitaut.  The prince turned to the company and\r\ntook his leave without uneasiness and with the calmest countenance: as he\r\nwas embracing M. de Brienne, secretary of state, he said to him, “Sir, as\r\nI have often received from you marks of your friendship and generosity, I\r\nflatter myself that you will some day tell the king the services I have\r\nrendered him.”  The princes went out; and, as they descended the\r\nstaircase, Conde leaned towards Comminges, who commanded the detachment\r\nof guards, saying, “Comminges, you are a man of honor and a gentleman;\r\nhave I anything to fear?”  Comminges assured him he had not, and that the\r\norders were merely to escort him to the wood of Vincennes. The carriage\r\nupset on the way; as soon as it was righted, Comminges ordered the driver\r\nto urge on his horses.  The prince burst out laughing.  “Don’t be afraid,\r\nComminges,” he said; “there is nobody to come to my assistance; I swear\r\nto you that I had not taken any precautions against this trip.”  On\r\narriving at the castle of Vincennes, there were no beds to be found, and\r\nthe three princes passed the night playing at cards; the Princess of\r\nConde and the dowager princess received orders to retire to their\r\nestates; the Duchess of Longueville, fearing with good cause that she\r\nwould be arrested, had taken with all speed the road to Normandy, whither\r\nshe went and took refuge at Dieppe, in her husband’s government.\r\n\r\nThe state-stroke had succeeded; Mazarin’s skill and prudence once more\r\ncheck-mated all the intrigues concocted against him; when the news was\r\ntold to Chavigny, in spite of all his reasons for bearing malice against\r\nthe cardinal, who had driven him from the council and kept him for some\r\ntime in prison, he exclaimed, “That is a great misfortune for the prince\r\nand his friends; but the truth must be told: the cardinal has done quite\r\nright; without it he would have been ruined.”  The contest was begun\r\nbetween Mazarin and the great Conde, and it was not with the prince that\r\nthe victory was to remain.\r\n\r\nAlready hostilities were commencing; Mazarin had done everything for the\r\nFrondeurs who remained faithful to him, but the house of Conde was\r\nrallying all its partisans; the Dukes of Bouillon and La Rochefoucauld\r\nhad thrown themselves into Bordeaux, which was in revolt against the\r\nroyal authority, represented by the Duke of Epernon.  The Princess of\r\nConde and her young son left Chantilly to join them; Madame de\r\nLongueville occupied Stenay, a strong place belonging to the Prince of\r\nConde: she had there found Turenne; on the other hand, the queen had just\r\nbeen through Normandy; all the towns had opened their gates to her; it\r\nwas just the same in Burgundy; the Princess of Conde’s able agent, Lenet,\r\ncould not obtain a declaration from the Parliament of Dijon in her favor.\r\nBordeaux was the focus of the insurrection; the people, passionately\r\ndevoted to “the dukes,” as the saying was, were forcing the hand of the\r\nParliament; riots were frequent in the town; the little king, with the\r\nqueen and the cardinal, marched in person upon Bordeaux; one of the\r\nfaubourgs was attacked, the dukes negotiated and obtained a general\r\namnesty, but no mention was made of the princes’ release.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of Paris took the matter up.  The premier president spoke\r\nin so bitter a tone of the unhappy policy of the minister, that the\r\nlittle king, feeling hurt, told his mother that, if he had thought it\r\nwould not displease her, he would have made the premier president hold\r\nhis tongue, and would have dismissed him.  On the 30th of January, Anne\r\nof Austria sent word to the Parliament that she would consent to grant\r\nthe release of the princes, “provided that the armaments of Stenay and of\r\nM. de Turenne might be discontinued.”  But it was too late; the Duke of\r\nOrleans had made a treaty with the princes.  England served as pretext.\r\nMazarin compared the Parliament to the House of Commons, and the\r\ncoadjutor to Cromwell.  Monsieur took the matter up for his friends, and\r\nwas angry.  He openly declared that he would not set foot again in the\r\nPalais-Royal as long as he was liable to meet the cardinal there, and\r\njoined the Parliament in demanding the removal of Mazarin.  The queen\r\nreplied that nobody had a right to interfere in the choice of ministers.\r\nBy way of answer, the Parliament laid injunctions upon all the officers\r\nof the crown to obey none but the Duke of Orleans, lieutenant general of\r\nthe kingdom.  A meeting of the noblesse, at a tumultuous assembly in the\r\nhouse of the Duke of Nemours, expressed themselves in the same sense.  It\r\nwas the 6th of February, 1651: during the night, Cardinal Mazarin set out\r\nfor St. Germain; a rumor spread in Paris that the queen was preparing to\r\nfollow him with the king; a rush was made to the Palais-Royal: the king\r\nwas in his bed.  Next day, Anne of Austria complained to the Parliament.\r\n“The prince is at liberty,” said the premier president, “and the king,\r\nthe king our master, is a prisoner.”  “Monsieur, who felt no fear,” says\r\nRetz, “because he had been more cheered in the streets and the hall of\r\nthe palace than he had ever been,” answered with vivacity, “The king was\r\na prisoner in the hands of Mazarin; but, thank God, he is not any\r\nlonger.”  The premier president was right; the king was a prisoner to the\r\nParisians; patrols of burgesses were moving incessantly round the Palais-\r\nRoyal; one night the queen was obliged to let the people into her\r\nchamber; the king was asleep; and two officers of the town-guard watched\r\nfor some hours at his pillow.  The yoke of Richelieu and the omnipotence\r\nof Mazarin were less hard for royalty to bear than the capricious and\r\njealous tyranny of the populace.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal saw that he was beaten; he made up his mind, and,\r\nanticipating the queen’s officers, he hurried to Le Havre to release the\r\nprisoners himself; he entered the castle alone, the governor having\r\nrefused entrance to the guards who attended him.  “The prince told me,”\r\n says Mdlle. de Montpensier, “that, when they were dining together,\r\nCardinal Mazarin was not so much in the humor to laugh as he himself was,\r\nand that he was very much embarrassed.  Liberty to be gone had more\r\ncharms for the prince than the cardinal’s company.  He said that he felt\r\nmarvellous delight at finding himself outside Le Havre, with his sword at\r\nhis side; and he might well be pleased to wear it; he is a pretty good\r\nhand at using it.  As he went out he turned to the cardinal and said,\r\n‘Farewell, Cardinal Mazarin,’ who kissed ‘the tip of sleeve’ to him.”\r\n\r\nThe cardinal had slowly taken the road to exile, summoning to him his\r\nnieces, Mdlles. Mancini and Martinozzi, whom he had, a short time since,\r\nsent for to court; he crossed from Normandy into Picardy, made some stay\r\nat Doullens, and, impelled by his enemies’ hatred, he finally crossed the\r\nfrontier on the 12th of March.  The Parliament had just issued orders for\r\nhis arrest in any part of France.  On the 6th of April, he fixed his\r\nquarters at Bruhl, a little town belonging to the electorate of Cologne,\r\nin the same territory which had but lately sheltered the last days of\r\nMary de’ Medici.\r\n\r\nThe Frondeurs, old and new, had gained the day; but even now there was\r\ndisorder in their camp.  Conde had returned to the court “like a raging\r\nlion, seeking to devour everybody, and, in revenge for his imprisonment,\r\nto set fire to the four corners of the realm.”  [_Memoires de Montglat._]\r\nAfter a moment’s reconciliation with the queen, be began to show himself\r\nmore and more haughty towards her in his demands every day; he required\r\nthe dismissal of the ministers Le Tellier, Servien, and Lionne, all three\r\ncreatures of the cardinal and in correspondence with him at Bruhl; as\r\nAnne of Austria refused, the prince retired to St. Maur; he was already\r\nin negotiation with Spain, being inveigled into treason by the influence\r\nof his sister, Madame de Longueville, who would not leave the Duke of\r\nLa Rochefoucauld or return into Normandy to her husband.  Fatal results\r\nof a guilty passion which enlisted against his country the arms of the\r\nhero of Rocroi!  When he returned to Paris, the queen had, in fact,\r\ndismissed her ministers, but she had formed a fresh alliance with the\r\ncoadjutor, and, on the 17th of August, in the presence of an assembly\r\nconvoked for that purpose at the Palais-Royal, she openly denounced the\r\nintrigues of the prince with Spain, accusing him of being in\r\ncorrespondence with the archduke.  Next day Conde brought the matter\r\nbefore the Parliament.  The coadjutor quite expected the struggle, and\r\nhad brought supporters; the queen had sent some soldiers; the prince\r\narrived with a numerous attendance.  On entering, he said to the company,\r\nthat he could not sufficiently express his astonishment at the condition\r\nin which he found the palace, which seemed to him more like a camp than a\r\ntemple of justice, and that it was not merely that there could be found\r\nin the kingdom people insolent enough to presume to dispute (superiority)\r\nthe pavement (disputer le pave) with him.  “I made him a deep obeisance,”\r\n says Retz, “and said that, I very humbly begged his Highness to pardon me\r\nif I told him that I did not believe that there was anybody in the\r\nkingdom insolent enough to dispute the wall (le haut du pave) with him,\r\nbut I was persuaded that there were some who could not and ought not, for\r\ntheir dignity’s sake, to yield the pavement (quitter le pave) to any but\r\nthe king.  The prince replied that he would make me yield it.  I said\r\nthat that would not be easy.”  The dispute grew warm; the presidents\r\nflung themselves between the disputants; Conde yielded to their\r\nentreaties, and begged the Duke of La Rochefoucauld to go and tell his\r\nfriends to withdraw.  The coadjutor went out to make the same request to\r\nhis friends.  “When he would have returned into the usher’s little\r\ncourt,” writes Mdlle. de Montpensier, “he met at the door the Duke of La\r\nRochefoucauld, who shut it in his face, just keeping it ajar to see who\r\naccompanied the coadjutor; he, seeing the door ajar, gave it a good push,\r\nbut he could not pass quite through, and remained as it were jammed\r\nbetween the two folds, unable to get in or out.  The Duke of La\r\nRochefoucauld had fastened the door with an iron catch, keeping it so to\r\nprevent its opening any wider.  The coadjutor was ‘in an ugly position,\r\nfor he could not help fearing lest a dagger should pop out and take his\r\nlife from behind.  A complaint was made to the grand chamber, and\r\nChamplatreux, son of the premier president, went out, and, by his\r\nauthority, had the door opened, in spite of the Duke of La\r\nRochefoucauld.”  The coadjutor protested, and the Duke of Brissac, his\r\nrelative, threatened the Duke of La Rochefoucauld; whereupon the latter\r\nsaid that, if he had them outside, he would strangle them both; to which\r\nthe coadjutor replied, “My dear La Franchise (the duke’s nickname), do\r\nnot act the bully; you are a poltroon and I am a priest; we shall not do\r\none another much harm.”  There was no fighting, and the Parliament,\r\nsupported by the Duke of Orleans, obtained from the queen a declaration\r\nof the innocence of the Prince of Conde, and at the same time a formal\r\ndisavowal of Mazarin’s policy, and a promise never to recall him.  Anne\r\nof Austria yielded everything; the king’s majority was approaching, and\r\nshe flattered herself that under cover of his name she would be able to\r\nwithdraw the concessions which she felt obliged to make as regent.  Her\r\ndeclaration, nevertheless, deeply wounded Mazarin, who was still taking\r\nrefuge at Bruhl, whence he wrote incessantly to the queen, who did not\r\nneglect his counsels.  “Ten times I have taken up my pen to write to\r\nyou,” he said on the 26th of September, 1651 [_Lettres du Cardinal\r\nMazarin a la Reine,_ pp. 292, 293], “but could not, and I am so beside\r\nmyself at the mortal wound I have just received, that I am not sure\r\nwhether anything I could say to you would have rhyme or reason.  The king\r\nand the queen, by an authentic deed, have declared me a traitor, a public\r\nrobber, an incapable, and an enemy to the repose of Christendom, after I\r\nhad served them with so many signs of my devotion to the advancement of\r\npeace: it is no longer a question of property, repose, or whatever else\r\nthere may be of the sort.  I demand the honor which has been taken from\r\nme, and that I be let alone, renouncing very heartily the cardinalate and\r\nthe benefices, whereof I send in my resignation joyfully, consenting\r\nwillingly to have given up to France twenty-three years of the best of my\r\nlife, all my pains and my little of wealth, and merely to withdraw with\r\nthe honor which I had when I began to serve her.”  The persistent hopes\r\nof the adroit Italian appeared once more in the postscript of the letter:\r\n“I had forgotten to tell you that it was not the way to set me right in\r\nthe eyes of the people to impress upon their mind that I am the cause of\r\nall the evils they suffer, and of all the disorders of the realm, in such\r\nsort that my ministry will be held in horror forever.”\r\n\r\nConde did not permit himself to be caught by the queen’s declarations:\r\nof all the princes he alone was missing at the ceremony of the bed of\r\njustice whereat the youthful Louis XIV., when entering his fourteenth\r\nyear, announced, on the 7th of September, to his people that, according\r\nthe laws of his realm, he “intended himself to assume the government,\r\nhoping of God’s goodness that it would be with piety and justice.”  The\r\nprince had retired to Chantilly, on the pretext that the new minister,\r\nthe president of the council, Chateauneuf, and the keeper of the seals,\r\nMatthew Mole, were not friends of his.  The Duchess of Longueville at\r\nlast carried the day; Conde was resolved upon civil war.  “You would have\r\nit,” he said to his sister on repelling the envoy, who had followed him\r\nto Bourges, from the queen and the Duke of Orleans; “remember that I draw\r\nthe sword in spite of myself, but I will be the last to sheathe it.”  And\r\nhe kept his word.\r\n\r\nA great disappointment awaited the rebels; they had counted upon the Duke\r\nof Bouillon and M. de Turenne, but neither of them would join the\r\nfaction.  The relations between the two great generals had not been\r\nwithout rubs; Turenne had, moreover, felt some remorse because he, being\r\na general in the king’s army, had but lately declared against the court,\r\n“doing thereby a deed at which Le Balafro and Admiral de Coligny would\r\nhave hesitated,” says Cardinal de Retz.  The two brothers went, before\r\nlong, and offered their services to the queen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Conde had arrived at Bordeaux: a part of Guienne, Saintonge,\r\nand Porigord had declared in his favor; Count d’Harcourt, at the head of\r\nthe royal troops, marched against La Rochelle, which he took from the\r\nrevolters under the very beard of the prince, who had come from Bordeaux\r\nto the assistance of the place, whilst the king and the queen, resolutely\r\nquitting Paris, advanced from town to town as far as Poitiers, keeping\r\nthe centre of France to its allegiance by their mere presence.  The\r\ntreaty of the Prince of Conde with Spain was concluded: eight Spanish\r\nvessels, having money and troops on board, entered the Gironde.  Conde\r\ndelivered over to them the castle and harbor of Talmont.  The queen had\r\ncommissioned the cardinal to raise levies in Germany, and he had already\r\nentered the country of Liege, embodying troops and forming alliances.  On\r\nthe 17th of November, Anne of Austria finally wrote to Mazarin to return\r\nto the king’s assistance.  In the presence of Conde’s rebellion she had\r\nno more appearances to keep up with anybody; and it was already in the\r\nmaster’s tone that Mazarin wrote to the queen, on the 30th of October, to\r\nput her on her guard against the Duke of Orleans: “The power committed to\r\nhis Royal Highness and the neutrality permitted to him, being as he is\r\nwholly devoted to the prince, surrounded by his partisans, and adhering\r\nblindly to their counsels, are matters highly prejudicial to the king’s\r\nservice, and, for my part, I do not see how one can be a servant of the\r\nking’s, with ever so little judgment and knowledge of affairs, and yet\r\ndispute these truths.  The queen, then, must bide her time to remedy all\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\nThe cardinal’s penetration had not deceived him; the Duke of Orleans was\r\nworking away in Paris, where the queen had been obliged to leave him, on\r\nthe Prince of Conde’s side.  The Parliament had assembled to enregister\r\nagainst the princes the proclamation of high treason despatched from\r\nBourges by the court; Gaston demanded that it should be sent back,\r\nthreatened as they were, he said, with a still greater danger than the\r\nrebellion of the princes in the return of Mazarin, who was even now\r\nadvancing to the frontier; but the premier president took no notice, and\r\nput the proclamation to the vote in these words “It is a great misfortune\r\nwhen princes of the blood give occasion for such proclamations, but this\r\nis a common and ordinary misfortune in the kingdom, and, for five or six\r\ncenturies past, it may be said that they have been the scourges of the\r\npeople and the enemies of the monarchy.”  The decree passed by a hundred\r\nvotes to forty.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of December, the cardinal crossed the frontier with a large\r\nbody of troops, and was received at Sedan by Lieutenant General Fabert,\r\nfaithful to his fortunes even in exile.  The Parliament was furious,\r\nand voted, almost unanimously, that the cardinal and his adherents were\r\nguilty of high treason; ordering the communes to hound him down, and\r\npromising, from the proceeds of his furniture and library which were\r\nabout to be sold, a sum of five hundred thousand livres to whoever should\r\ntake him dead or alive.  At once began the sale of the magnificent\r\nlibrary which the cardinal had liberally opened to the public.  The\r\ndispersion of the books was happily stopped in time to still leave a\r\nnucleus for the Mazarin Library.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mazarin had not allowed himself to be frightened by\r\nparliamentary decrees or by dread of assassins.  Re-entering France with\r\nsix thousand men, he forced the passage of Pontsur-Yonne, in spite of the\r\ntwo councillors of the Parliaments who were commissioned to have him\r\narrested; the Duke of Beaufort, at the head of Monsieur’s troops, did not\r\neven attempt to impede his march; and, on the 28th of January, the\r\ncardinal entered Poitiers, at once resuming his place beside the king,\r\nwho had come to meet him a league from the town.  The court took\r\nleisurely the road to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe coadjutor had received the price of his services in the royal cause;\r\nhe was a cardinal “sooner,” said he, “than Mazarias would have had him;”\r\n and so the new prince of the church considered himself released from any\r\ngratitude to the court, and sought to form a third party, at the head of\r\nwhich was to be placed the Duke of Orleans as nominal head.  Monsieur,\r\nharried by intrigues in all directions, remained in a state of inaction,\r\nand made a pretension of keeping Paris neutral; his daughter, Mdlle. de\r\nMontpensier, who detested Anne of Austria and Mazarin, and would have\r\nliked to marry the king, had boldly taken the side of the princes; the\r\ncourt had just arrived at Blois, on the 27th of March, 1652; the keeper\r\nof the seals, Mole, presented himself in front of Orleans to summon the\r\ntown to open its gates to the king; at that very moment arrived Mdlle.,\r\nthe great Mdlle., as she was then called; and she claimed possession of\r\nOrleans in her father’s name.  “It was the appanage of Monsieur; but the\r\ngates were shut and barricaded.  After they had been told that it was I,”\r\n writes Mdlle., “they did not open; and I was there three hours.  The\r\ngovernor sent me some sweetmeats, and what appeared to me rather funny\r\nwas that he gave me to understand that he had no influence.  At the\r\nwindow of the sentry-box was the Marquis d’Halluys, who watched me\r\nwalking up and down by the fosse.  The rampart was fringed with people\r\nwho shouted incessantly, ‘Hurrah for the king! hurrah for the princes!\r\nNone of your Mazarin!’  I could not help calling out to them, ‘Go to the\r\nHotel de Ville and get the gate opened to me!’  The captain made signs\r\nthat he had not the keys.  I said to him, ‘It must be burst open, and you\r\nowe me more allegiance than to the gentlemen of the town, seeing that I\r\nam your master’s daughter.’  The boatmen offered to break open for me a\r\ngate which was close by there.  I told them to make haste, and I mounted\r\nupon a pretty high mound of earth overlooking that gate.  I thought but\r\nlittle about any nice way of getting thither; I climbed like a cat; I\r\nheld on to briers and thorns, and I leapt all the hedges without hurting\r\nmyself at all; two boats were brought up to serve me for a bridge, and in\r\nthe second was placed a ladder by which I mounted.  The gate was burst at\r\nlast.  Two planks had been forced out of the middle; signs were made to\r\nme to advance; and as there was a great deal of mud, a footman took me\r\nup, carried me along, and put me through this hole, through which I had\r\nno sooner passed my head than the drums began beating.  I gave my hand to\r\nthe captain, and said to him, “You will be very glad that you can boast\r\nof having managed to get me in.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Great Mademoiselle----373]\r\n\r\nThe keeper of the seals was obliged to return to Blois, and Mdlle. kept\r\nOrleans, but without being able to effect an entrance for the troops of\r\nthe Dukes of Nemours and Beaufort, who had just tried a surprise against\r\nthe court.  Had it not been for the aid of Turenne, who had defended the\r\nbridge of Jargeau, the king might have fallen into the hands of his\r\nrevolted subjects.  The queen rested at Gien whilst the princes went on\r\nas far as Montargis, thus cutting off the communications of the court\r\nwith Paris.  Turenne was preparing to fall upon his incapable adversaries\r\nwhen the situation suddenly changed: the, Prince of Conde, weary of the\r\nbad state of his affairs in Guienne, where the veteran soldiers of the\r\nCount of Harcourt had the advantage everywhere over the new levies, had\r\ntraversed France in disguise, and forming a junction, on the 1st of\r\nApril, with the Dukes of Nemours and Beaufort, threw himself upon the\r\nquarters of Marshal d’Hocquincourt, defeated him, burned his camp, and\r\ndrove him back to Bldneau; a rapid march on the part of Turenne, coming\r\nto the aid of his colleague, forced Conde to fall back upon Chatillon;\r\non the 11th of April he was in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe princes had relied upon the irritation caused by the return of\r\nMazarin to draw Paris into the revolt, but they were only half\r\nsuccessful; the Parliament would scarcely give Conde admittance;\r\nPresident de Bailleul, who occupied the chair in the absence of Mole,\r\ndeclared that the body always considered it an honor to see the prince in\r\ntheir midst, but that they would have preferred not to see him there in\r\nthe state in which he was at the time, with his hands still bloody from\r\nthe defeat of the king’s troops.  Amelot, premier president of the Court\r\nof Aids, said to the prince’s face, “that it was a matter of\r\nastonishment, after many battles delivered or sustained against his\r\nMajesty’s troops, to see him not only returning to Paris without having\r\nobtained letters of amnesty, but still appearing amongst the sovereign\r\nbodies as if he gloried in the spoils of his Majesty’s subjects, and\r\ncausing the drum to be beaten for levying troops, to be paid by money\r\ncoming from Spain, in the capital of the realm, the most loyal city\r\npossessed by the king.”  The city of Paris resolved not to make “common\r\ncause or furnish money to assist the princes against the king under\r\npretext of its being against Mazarin.”  The populace alone were favorable\r\nto the princes’ party.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Turenne had easy work with the secondary generals remaining at\r\nthe head of the factious army; by his able maneeuvres he had covered the\r\nmarch of the court, which established itself at St. Germain.\r\n\r\nConde assembled his forces encamped around Paris: he intended to fortify\r\nhimself at the confluence of the Seine and the Marne, hoping to be\r\nsupported by the little army which had just been brought up by Duke\r\nCharles of Lorraine, as capricious and adventurous as ever.  Turenne and\r\nthe main body of his troops barred the passage.  Conde threw himself back\r\nupon Faubourg St. Antoine, and there intrenched himself, at the outlet of\r\nthe three principal streets which abutted upon Porte St. Antoine (now\r\nPlace do la Bastille).  Turenne had meant to wait for re-enforcements and\r\nartillery, but the whole court had flocked upon the heights of Charonne\r\nto see the fight; pressure was put upon him, and the marshal gave the\r\nword to attack.  The army of the Fronde fought with fury.  “I did not see\r\na Prince of Conde,” Turenne used to say; “I saw more than a dozen.”  The\r\nking’s soldiers had entered the houses, thus turning the barricades;\r\nMarshal Ferte had just arrived with the artillery, and was sweeping Rue\r\nSt. Antoine.  The princes’ army was about to be driven back to the foot\r\nof the walls of Paris, when the cannon of the Bastille, replying all on a\r\nsudden to the volleys of the royal troops, came like a thunderbolt on M.\r\nde Turenne; the Porte St. Antoine opened, and the Parisians, under arms,\r\nfringing the streets, protected the return of the rebel army.  Mdlle. de\r\nMontpensier had taken the command of the city of Paris.\r\n\r\nFor a week past the Duke of Orleans had been ill, or pretended to be; he\r\nrefused to give any order.  When the prince began his movement, on the 2d\r\nof July, early, he sent to beg Mdlle. not to desert him.  “I ran to the\r\nLuxembourg,” she says, “and I found Monsieur at the top of the stairs.\r\n‘I thought I should find you in bed,’ said I; ‘Count Fiesque told me that\r\nyou didn’t feel well.’ He answered, ‘I am not ill enough for that, but\r\nenough not to go out.’  I begged him to ride out to the aid of the\r\nprince, or, at any rate, to go to bed and assume to be ill; but I could\r\nget nothing from him.  I went so far as to say, ‘Short of having a treaty\r\nwith the court in your pocket, I cannot understand how you can take\r\nthings so easily; but can you really have one to sacrifice the prince to\r\nCardinal Mazarin?’  He made no reply: all I said lasted quite an hour,\r\nduring which every friend we had might have been killed, and the prince\r\nas well as another, without anybody’s caring; nay, there were people of\r\nMonsieur’s in high spirits, hoping that the prince would perish; they\r\nwere friends of Cardinal de Retz.  At last Monsieur gave me a letter for\r\nthe gentlemen of the Hotel, leaving it to me to tell them his intention.\r\nI was there in a moment, assuring those present that, if ill luck would\r\nhave it that the enemy should beat the prince, no more quarter would be\r\nshown to Paris than to the men who bore arms.  Marshal de l’Hopital,\r\ngovernor of Paris for the king, said to me, ‘You are aware, Mdlle., that\r\nif your troops had not approached this city, those of the king would not\r\nhave come thither, and that they only came to drive them away.’  Madame\r\nde Nemours did not like this, and began to argue the point.  I broke off\r\ntheir altercation.  ‘Consider, sir, that, whilst time is being wasted in\r\ndiscussing useless matters, the prince is in danger in your faubourgs.’”\r\n She carried with her the aid of the Duke of Orleans’ troops, and\r\nimmediately moved forwards, meeting everywhere on her road her friends\r\nwounded or dying.  “When I was near the gate, I went into the house of an\r\nexchequer-master (maitre des comptes).  As soon as I was there, the\r\nprince came thither to see me; he was in a pitiable state; he had two\r\nfingers’ breadth of dust on his face, and his hair all matted; his collar\r\nand his shirt were covered with blood, although he was not wounded; his\r\nbreastplate was riddled all over; and he held his sword bare in his hand,\r\nhaving lost the scabbard.  He said to me, ‘You see a man in despair; I\r\nhave lost all my friends; MM. de Nemours, de la Rochefoucauld, and\r\nClinchamps are wounded to death.’  I consoled him a little by telling him\r\nthat they were in better case than he supposed.  Then I went off to the\r\nBastille, where I made them load the cannon which was trained right upon\r\nthe city; and I gave orders to fire as soon as I had gone.  I went thence\r\nto the Porte St. Antoine.  The soldiers shouted, ‘Let us do something\r\nthat will astonish them; our retreat is secure; here is Mdlle. at the\r\ngate, and she will have it opened for us, if we are hard pressed.’  The\r\nprince gave orders to march back into the city; he seemed to me quite\r\ndifferent from what he had been early in the day, though he had not\r\nchanged at all; he paid me a thousand compliments and thanks for the\r\ngreat service he considered that I had rendered him.  I said to him,\r\n‘I have a favor to ask of you: that is, not to say anything to Monsieur\r\nabout the laches he has displayed towards you.’  At this very moment up\r\ncame Monsieur, who embraced the prince with as gay an air as if he had\r\nnot left him at all in the lurch.  The prince confessed that he had never\r\nbeen in so dangerous a position.”\r\n\r\nThe fight at Porte St. Antoine had not sufficiently compromised the\r\nParisians, who began to demand peace at any price.  The mob, devoted to\r\nthe princes, set themselves to insult in the street all those who did not\r\nwear in their hats a tuft of straw, the rallying sign of the faction.  On\r\nthe 4th of July, at the general assembly of the city, when the king’s\r\nattorney-general proposed to conjure his Majesty to return to Paris\r\nwithout Cardinal Mazarin, the princes, who demanded the union of the\r\nParisians with themselves, rose up and went out, leaving the assembly to\r\nthe tender mercies of the crowd assembled on the Place de Greve.  “Down\r\non the Mazarins!” was the cry; “there are none but Mazarins any longer at\r\nthe Hotel de Ville!”  Fire was applied to the doors defended by the\r\narchers; all the outlets were guarded by men beside themselves; more than\r\nthirty burgesses of note were massacred; many died of their wounds, the\r\nHotel de Ville was pillaged, Marshal de l’Hopital escaped with great\r\ndifficulty, and the provost of tradesmen yielded up his office to\r\nCouncillor Broussel.  Terror reigned in Paris: it was necessary to drag\r\nthe magistrates to the Palace of Justice to decree, on the 19th of July,\r\nby seventy-four votes against sixty-nine, that the Duke of Orleans should\r\nbe appointed “lieutenant-general of the kingdom, and the Prince of Conde\r\ncommandant of all the armies.”  The usurpation of the royal authority was\r\nflagrant, the city-assembly voted subsidies, and Paris wrote to all the\r\ngood towns of France to announce to them her resolution.  Chancellor\r\nSeguier had the poltroonery to accept the presidency of the council,\r\noffered him by the Duke of Orleans; he thus avenged himself for the\r\npreference the, queen had but lately shown for Mole by confiding the\r\nseals to him.  At the same time the Spaniards were entering France; for\r\nall the strong places were dismantled or disgarrisoned.  The king,\r\nobliged to confront civil war, had abandoned his frontiers; Gravelines\r\nhad fallen on the 18th of May, and the arch-duke had undertaken the siege\r\nof Dunkerque.  At Conde’s instance, he detached a body of troops, which\r\nhe sent, under the orders of Count Fuendalsagna, to join the Duke of\r\nLorraine, who had again approached Paris.  Everywhere the fortune of arms\r\nappeared to be against the king.  “This year we lost Barcelona,\r\nCatalonia, and Casale, the key of Italy,” says Cardinal de Retz.  We saw\r\nBrisach in revolt, on the point of falling once more into the hands of\r\nthe house of Austria.  We saw the flags and standards of Spain fluttering\r\non the Pont Neuf, the yellow scarfs of Lorraine appeared in Paris as\r\nfreely as the isabels and the blues.”  Dissension, ambition, and\r\npoltroonery were delivering France over to the foreigner.\r\n\r\nThe evil passions of men, under the control of God, help sometimes to\r\ndestroy and sometimes to preserve them.  The interests of the Spaniards\r\nand of the Prince of Conde were not identical.  He desired to become the\r\nmaster of France, and to command in the king’s name; the enemy were\r\nlaboring to humiliate France and to prolong the war indefinitely: The\r\narch-duke recalled Count Fuendalsagna to Dunkerque; and Turenne,\r\nwithstanding the terrors of the court, which would fain have fled first\r\ninto Normandy and then to Lyons, prevailed upon the queen to establish\r\nherself at Pontoise, whilst the army occupied Compiegne.  At every point\r\ncutting off the passage of the Duke of Lorraine, who had been re-enforced\r\nby a body of Spaniards, Turenne held the enemy in check for three weeks,\r\nand prevented them from marching on Paris.  All parties began to tire of\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nCardinal Mazarin took his line, and loudly demanded of the king\r\npermission to withdraw, in order, by his departure, to restore peace to\r\nthe kingdom.  The queen refused.  “There is no consideration shown,” she\r\nsaid, “for my son’s honor and my own; we will not suffer him to go away.”\r\n But the cardinal insisted.  Prudent and far-sighted as he was, he knew\r\nthat to depart was the only way of remaining.  He departed on the 19th of\r\nAugust, but without leaving the frontier: he took up his quarters at\r\nBouillon.  The queen had summoned the Parliament to her at Pontoise.  A\r\nsmall number of magistrates responded to her summons, enough, however, to\r\ngive the queen the right to proclaim rebellious the Parliament remaining\r\nat Paris.  Chancellor Srguier made his escape, in order to go and rejoin\r\nthe court.  Nobody really believed in the cardinal’s withdrawal; men are\r\nfond of yielding to appear ances in order to excuse in their own eyes a\r\nchange in their own purposes.  Disorder went on increasing in Paris; the\r\ngreat lords, in their discontent, were quarrelling one with another; the\r\nPrince of Conde struck M. de Rieux, who returned the blow; the Duke of\r\nNemours was killed in a duel by M. de Beaufort; the burgesses were\r\ngrowing weary of so much anarchy; a public display of feeling in favor\r\nof peace took place on the 24th of September in the garden of the\r\nPalais-Royal; those present stuck in their hats pieces of white paper in\r\nopposition to the Frondeurs’ tufts of straw.  People fought in the\r\nstreets on behalf of these tokens. For some weeks past Cardinal de Retz\r\nhad remained inactive, and his friends pressed him to move.  “You see\r\nquite well,” they said, “that Mazarin is but a sort of jack-in-the-box,\r\nout of sight to-day and popping up to-morrow; but you also see that,\r\nwhether he be in or out, the spring that sends him up or down is that of\r\nthe royal authority, the which will not, apparently, be so very soon\r\nbroken by the means taken to break it.  The obligation you are under\r\ntowards Monsieur, and even towards the public, as regards Mazarin, does\r\nnot allow you to work for his restoration; he is no longer here, and,\r\nthough his absence may be nothing but a mockery and a delusion, it\r\nnevertheless gives you an opportunity for taking certain steps which\r\nnaturally lead to that which is for your good.”  Retz lost no time in\r\ngoing to Compiegne, where the king had installed himself after Mazarin’s\r\ndeparture; he took with him a deputation of the clergy, and received in\r\ndue form the cardinal’s hat.  He was the bearer of proposals for an\r\naccommodation from the Duke of Orleans, but the queen cut him short.  The\r\ncourt perceived its strength, and the instructions of Cardinal Mazarin\r\nwere precise.  The ruin of De Retz was from that moment resolved upon.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Conde was ill; he had left the command of his troops to M.\r\ndo Tavannes; during the night between the 5th and 6th of October, Turenne\r\nstruck his camp at Villeneuve St. Georges, crossed the Seine at Corbeil,\r\nthe Marne at Meaux, without its being in the enemy’s power to stop him,\r\nand established himself in the neighborhood of Dammartin.  Conde was\r\nfurious.  “Tavannes and Vallon ought to wear bridles,” he said; “they are\r\nasses;” he left his house, and placed himself once more at the head of\r\nhis army, at first following after Turenne, and soon to sever himself\r\ncompletely from that Paris which was slipping away from him.  “He would\r\nfind himself more at home at the head of four squadrons in the Ardennes\r\nthan commanding a dozen millions of such fellows as we have here, without\r\nexcepting President Charton,” said the Duke of Orleans.  “The prince was\r\nwasting away with sheer disgust; he was so weary of hearing all the talk\r\nabout Parliament, court of aids, chambers in assembly, and Hotel de\r\nVille, that he would often declare that his grandfather had never been\r\nmore fatigued by the parsons of La Rochelle.”  The great Conde was\r\nathirst for the thrilling emotions of war; and the crime he committed was\r\nto indulge at any price that boundless passion.  Ever victorious at the\r\nhead of French armies, he was about to make experience of defeat in the\r\nservice of the foreigner.\r\n\r\nThe king had proclaimed a general amnesty on the 18th of October; and on\r\nthe 21st he set out in state for Paris.  The Duke of Orleans still\r\nwavered.  “You wanted peace,” said Madame, “when it depended but on you\r\nto make war; you now want war when you can make neither war nor peace.\r\nIt is of no use to think any longer of anything but going with a good\r\ngrace to meet the king.”  At these words he exclaimed aloud, as if it had\r\nbeen proposed to him to go and throw himself in the river.  “And where\r\nthe devil should I go?”  he answered.  He remained at the Luxembourg.  On\r\ndrawing near Paris, the king sent word to his uncle that he would have to\r\nleave the city.  Gaston replied in the following letter:--\r\n\r\n     “MONSEIGNEUR: Having understood from my cousin the Duke of Danville\r\n     and from Sieur d’Aligre, the respect that your Majesty would have me\r\n     pay you, I most humbly beseech your Majesty to allow me to assure\r\n     you by these lines that I do not propose to remain in Paris longer\r\n     than tillto-morrow; and that I will go my way to my house at\r\n     Limours, having no more passionate desire than to testify by my\r\n     perfect obedience that I am, with submission,\r\n\r\n     “Monseigneur,\r\n     “Your most humble and most obedient servant and subject,\r\n     “GASTON.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans retired before long to his castle at Blois, where he\r\ndied in 1660; deserted, towards the end of his life, by all the friends\r\nhe had successively abandoned and betrayed.  “He had, with the exception\r\nof courage, all that was necessary to make an honorable man,” says\r\nCardinal de Retz, “but weakness was predominant in his heart through\r\nfear, and in his mind through irresolution; it disfigured the whole\r\ncourse of his life.  He engaged in everything because he had not strength\r\nto resist those who drew him on, and he always came out disgracefully,\r\nbecause he had not the courage to support them.”  He was a prey to fear,\r\nfear of his friends as well as of his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Fronde was all over, that of the gentry of the long robe as well as\r\nthat of the gentry of the sword.  The Parliament of Paris was once more\r\nfalling in the state to the rank which had been assigned to it by\r\nRichelieu, and from which it had wanted to emerge by a supreme effort.\r\nThe attempt had been the same in France as in England, however different\r\nhad been the success.  It was the same yearnings of patriotism and\r\nfreedom, the same desire on the part of the country to take an active\r\npart in its own government, which had inspired the opposition of the\r\nParliament of England to the despotism of Charles I., and the opposition\r\nof the French Parliaments to Richelieu as well as to Mazarin.  It was\r\nEngland’s good fortune to have but one Parliament of politicians, instead\r\nof ten Parliaments of magistrates, the latter more fit for the theory\r\nthan the practice of public affairs; and the Reformation had, beforehand,\r\naccustomed its people to discussion as well as to liberty.  Its great\r\nlords and its gentlemen placed themselves from the first at the head of\r\nthe national movement, demanding nothing and expecting nothing for\r\nthemselves from the advantages they claimed for their country.  The\r\nremnant of the feudal system had succumbed with the Duke of Montmorency\r\nunder Richelieu; France knew not the way to profit by the elements of\r\ncourage, disinterestedness, and patriotism offered her by her magistracy;\r\nshe had the misfortune to be delivered over to noisy factions of princes\r\nand great lords, ambitious or envious, greedy of honors and riches, as\r\nready to fight the court as to be on terms with it, and thinking far more\r\nof their own personal interests than of the public service.  Without any\r\nunity of action or aim, and by turns excited and dismayed by the examples\r\nthat came to them from England, the Frondeurs had to guide them no\r\nHampden or Cromwell; they had at their backs neither people nor army; the\r\nEnglish had been able to accomplish a revolution; the Fronde failed\r\nbefore the dexterous prudence of Mazarin and the queen’s fidelity to her\r\nminister.  In vain did the coadjutor aspire to take his place; Anne of\r\nAustria had not forgotten the Earl of Strafford.--Cardinal de Retz\r\nlearned before long the hollowness of his hopes.  On the 19th of\r\nDecember, 1652, as he was repairing to the Louvre, he was arrested by M.\r\nde Villequier, captain of the guards on duty, and taken the same evening\r\nto the Bois de Vincennes; there was a great display of force in the\r\nstreet and around the carriage; but nobody moved,  whether it were,” says\r\nRetz, “that the dejection of the people was too great, or that those who\r\nwere well-inclined towards me lost courage on seeing nobody at their\r\nhead.”  People were tired of raising barricades and hounding down the\r\nking’s soldiers.\r\n\r\n“I was taken into a large room where there were neither hangings nor bed;\r\nthat which was brought in about eleven o’clock at night was of Chinese\r\ntaffeta, not at all the thing for winter furniture.  I slept very well,\r\nwhich must not be attributed to stout-heartedness, because misfortune has\r\nnaturally that effect upon me.  I have on more than one occasion\r\ndiscovered that it wakes me in the morning and sends me to sleep at\r\nnight.  I was obliged to get up the next day without a fire, because\r\nthere was no wood to make one, and the three exons who had been posted\r\nnear me had the kindness to assure me that I should not be without it the\r\nnext day.  He who remained alone on guard over me took it for himself,\r\nand I was a whole fortnight, at Christmas, in a room as big as a church,\r\nwithout warming myself.  I do not believe that there could be found under\r\nheaven another man like this exon.  He stole my linen, my clothes, my\r\nboots, and I was sometimes obliged to stay in bed eight or ten days for\r\nlack of anything to put on.  I could not believe that I was subjected to\r\nsuch treatment without orders from some superior, and without some mad\r\nnotion of making me die of vexation.  I fortified myself against that\r\nnotion, and I resolved at any rate not to die that kind of death.  At\r\nlast I got him into the habit of not tormenting me any more, by dint of\r\nletting him see that I did not torment myself at all.  In point of fact I\r\nhad risen pretty nearly superior to all these ruses, for which I had a\r\nsupreme contempt; but I could not assume the same loftiness of spirit in\r\nrespect of the prison’s entity (substance), if one may use the term, and\r\nthe sight of myself, every morning when I awoke, in the hands of my\r\nenemies made me perceive that I was anything rather than a stoic.”\r\n The Archbishop of Paris had just died, and the dignity passed to his\r\ncoadjutor; as the price of his release, Mazarin demanded his resignation.\r\nThe clergy of Paris were highly indignant; Cardinal de Retz was removed\r\nto the castle of Nantes, whence he managed to make his escape in August,\r\n1653; for nine years he lived abroad, in Spain, Italy, and Germany,\r\neverywhere mingling in the affairs of Europe, engaged in intrigue, and\r\nnot without influence; when at last he returned to France, in 1662, he\r\nresigned the archbishopric of Paris, and established himself in the\r\nprincipality of Commercy, which belonged to him, occupied up to the day\r\nof his death in paying his debts, doing good to his friends and servants,\r\nwriting his memoirs, and making his peace with God.  This was in those\r\ndays a solicitude which never left the most worldly: the Prince of Conti\r\nhad died very devout, and Madame de Longueville had just expired at the\r\nCarmelites’, after twenty-five years’ penance, when Cardinal de Retz died\r\non the 24th of August, 1679.  At the time of his arrest, it was a common\r\nsaying of the people in the street that together with “Cardinal de Retz\r\nit would have been a very good thing to imprison Cardinal Mazarin as\r\nwell, in order to teach them of the clergy not to meddle for the future\r\nin the things of this world.”  Language which was unjust to the grand\r\ngovernment of Cardinal Richelieu, unjust even to Cardinal Mazarin.  The\r\nlatter was returning with greater power than ever at the moment when\r\nCardinal de Retz, losing forever the hope of supplanting him in power,\r\nwas beginning that life of imprisonment and exile which was ultimately to\r\ngive him time to put retirement and repentance between himself and death.\r\n\r\nCardinal Mazarin had once more entered France, but he had not returned to\r\nParis.  The Prince of Conde, soured by the ill-success of the Fronde and\r\ndemented by illimitable pride, had not been ashamed to accept the title\r\nof generalissimo of the Spanish armies; Turenne had succeeded in hurling\r\nhim back into Luxembourg, and it was in front of Bar, besieged, that\r\nMazarin, with a body of four thousand men, joined the French army; Bar\r\nwas taken, and the campaign of 1652, disastrous at nearly every point,\r\nhad just finished with this success, when the cardinal re-entered Paris\r\nat the end of January, 1653.  Six months later, at the end of July, the\r\ninsurrection in Guienne was becoming extinguished by a series of private\r\nconventions; the king’s armies were entering Bordeaux; the revolted\r\nprinces received their pardon, waiting, meanwhile, for the Prince of\r\nConti to marry, as he did next year, Mdlle. Martinozzi, one of Mazarin’s\r\nnieces; Madame de Longueville retired to Moulin’s into the convent where\r\nher aunt, Madame de Montmorency, had for the last twenty years been\r\nmourning for her husband; Conde was the only rebel left, more dangerous,\r\nfor France, than all the hostile armies he commanded. Cardinal Mazarin\r\nwas henceforth all-powerful; whatever may have been the nature of the\r\nties which united him to the queen, he had proved their fidelity and\r\nstrength too fully to always avoid the temptation of adopting the tone of\r\na master; the young king’s confidence in his minister, who had brought\r\nhim up, equalled that of his mother; the merits as well as the faults of\r\nMazarin were accordingly free to crop out: he was neither vindictive nor\r\ncruel towards even his most inveterate enemies, whom he could not manage,\r\nas Richelieu did, to confound with those of the state; the excesses of\r\nthe factions had sufficed to destroy them.  “Time is an able fellow,” the\r\ncardinal would frequently say; if people often complained of being badly\r\ncompensated for their services, Mazarin could excuse himself on the\r\nground of the deplorable, condition of the finances.  He nevertheless\r\nfeathered his own nest inordinately, taking care, however, not to rob the\r\npeople, it was said.  He confined himself to selling everything at a\r\nprofit to himself, even the offices of the royal household, without\r\nmaking, as Richelieu had made, any “advance out of his own money to the\r\nstate, when there was none in the treasury.”  The power had been honestly\r\nwon, if the fortune were of a doubtful kind.  M. Mignet has said with his\r\nmanly precision of language, “Amidst those unreasonable disturbances\r\nwhich upset for a while the judgment of the great Turenne, which, in the\r\ncase of the great Conde, turned the sword of Rocroi against France, and\r\nwhich led Cardinal Retz to make so poor a use of his talent, there was\r\nbut one firm will, and that was Anne of Austria’s; but one man of good\r\nsense, and that was Mazarin.”  [_Introduction aux Negotiations pour la\r\nSuccession d’.Espagne._]\r\n\r\nFrom 1653 to 1657, Turenne, seconded by Marshal La Ferte and sometimes by\r\nCardinal Mazarin in person, constantly kept the Spaniards and the Prince\r\nof Conde in check, recovering the places but lately taken from France and\r\nrelieving the besieged towns; without ever engaging in pitched battles,\r\nhe almost always had the advantage.  Mazarin resolved to strike a\r\ndecisive blow.  It was now three years since, after long negotiations,\r\nthe cardinal had concluded with Cromwell, Protector of the Commonwealth\r\nof England, a treaty of peace and commerce, the prelude and first fruits\r\nof a closer alliance which the able minister of Anne of Austria had not\r\nceased to wish for and pave the way for.  On the 23d of March, 1657, the\r\nparleys ended at last in a treaty of alliance offensive and defensive;\r\nit was concluded at Paris between France and England.  Cromwell promised\r\nthat a body of six thousand English, supported by a fleet prepared to\r\nvictual and aid them along the coasts, should go and join the French\r\narmy, twenty thousand strong, to make war on the Spanish Low Countries,\r\nand especially to besiege the three forts of Gravelines, Mardyk, and\r\nDunkerque, the last of which was to be placed in the hands of the English\r\nand remain in their possession.  Six weeks after the conclusion of the\r\ntreaty, the English troops disembarked at Boulogne; they were regiments\r\nformed and trained in the long struggles of the civil war, drilled to the\r\nmost perfect discipline, of austere manners, and of resolute and stern\r\ncourage; the king came in person to receive them on their arrival; Mardyk\r\nwas soon taken and placed as pledge in the hands of the English.\r\nCromwell sent two fresh regiments for the siege of Dunkerque.  In the\r\nspring of 1658, Turenne invested the place.  Louis XIV. and Mazarin went\r\nto Calais to be present at this great enterprise.\r\n\r\n“At Brussels,” says M. Guizot in his _Histoire de la Republique\r\nd’Angleterre et de Cromwell,_ “neither Don Juan nor the Marquis of\r\nCarracena would believe that Dunkerque was in danger; being at the same\r\ntime indolent and proud, they disdained the counsel, at one time of\r\nvigilant activity and at another of prudent reserve, which was constantly\r\ngiven them by  Conde; they would not have anybody come and rouse them\r\nduring their siesta if any unforeseen incident occurred, nor allow any\r\ndoubt of their success when once they were up and on horseback.  They\r\nhurried away to the defence of Dunkerque, leaving behind them their\r\nartillery and a portion of their cavalry.   Conde, conjured them to\r\nintrench themselves whilst awaiting them; Don Juan, on the contrary,\r\nwas for advancing on to the dunes and marching to meet the French army.\r\n‘You don’t reflect,’ said Conde ‘that ground is fit only for infantry,\r\nand that of the French is more numerous and has seen more service.’\r\n‘I am persuaded,’ replied Don Juan, ‘that they will not ever dare to look\r\nHis Most Catholic Majesty’s army in the face.’  ‘Ah! you don’t know M. de\r\nTurenne; no mistake is made with impunity in the presence of such a man\r\nas that.’  Don Juan persisted, and, in fact, made his way on to the\r\n‘dunes.’  Next day, the 13th of June, Conde, more and more convinced of\r\nthe danger, made fresh efforts to make him retire.  ‘Retire!’ cried Don\r\nJuan: ‘if the French dare fight, this will be the finest day that ever\r\nshone on the arms of His Most Catholic Majesty.’  ‘Very fine, certainly,’\r\nanswered Conde, ‘if you give orders to retire.’  Turenne put an end to\r\nthis disagreement in the enemy’s camp.  Having made up his mind to give\r\nbattle on the 14th, at daybreak, he sent word to the English general,\r\nLockhart, by one of his officers who wanted at the same time to explain\r\nthe commander-in-chief’s plan and his grounds for it.  ‘All right,’\r\nanswered Lockhart: ‘I leave it to M. de Turenne; he shall tell me his\r\nreasons after the battle, if he likes.’  A striking contrast between the\r\nmanly discipline of English good sense and the silly blindness of Spanish\r\npride.  Conde was not mistaken: the issue of a battle begun under such\r\nauspices could not be doubtful.  ‘My lord,’ said he to the young Duke of\r\nGloucester, who was serving in the Spanish army by the side of his\r\nbrother, the Duke of York, ‘did you ever see a battle?’  ‘No, prince.’\r\n‘Well, then, you are going to see one lost.’  The battle of the Dunes\r\nwas, in fact, totally lost by the Spaniards, after four hours’ very hard\r\nfighting, during which the English regiments carried bravely, and with\r\nheavy losses, the most difficult and the best defended position; all the\r\nofficers of Lockhart’s regiment, except two, were killed or wounded\r\nbefore the end of the day; the Spanish army retired in disorder, leaving\r\nfour thousand prisoners in the hands of the conqueror.  ‘The enemy came\r\nto meet us,’ wrote Turenne, in the evening, to his wife; ‘they were\r\nbeaten, God be praised!  I have worked rather hard all day; I wish you\r\ngood night, and am going to bed.’  Ten days afterwards, on the 23d of\r\nJune, 1658, the garrison of Dunkerque was exhausted; the aged governor,\r\nthe Marquis of Leyden, had been mortally wounded in a sortie; the place\r\nsurrendered, and, the next day but one, Louis XIV. entered it, but merely\r\nto hand it over at once to the English.  ‘Though the court and the army\r\nare in despair at the notion of letting go what he calls a rather nice\r\nmorsel,’ wrote Lockhart, the day before, to Secretary Thurloe,\r\n‘nevertheless the cardinal is staunch to his promises, and seems as well\r\nsatisfied at giving up this place to his Highness as I am to take it.\r\nThe king, also, is extremely polite and obliging, and he has in his soul\r\nmore honesty than I had supposed.’”\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Dunkerque was soon followed by that of Gravelines and\r\nseveral other towns; the great blow against the Spanish arms had been\r\nstruck; negotiations were beginning; tranquillity reigned everywhere in\r\nFrance; the Parliament had caused no talk since the 20th of March, 1655,\r\nwhen, they having refused to enregister certain financial edicts, for\r\nwant of liberty of suffrage, the king, setting out from the castle of\r\nVincennes, “had arrived early at the Palace of Justice, in scarlet jacket\r\nand gray hat, attended by all his court in the same costume, as if he\r\nwere going to hunt the stag, which was unwonted up to that day.  When he\r\nwas in his bed of justice, he prohibited the Parliament from assembling,\r\nand, after having said a word or two, he rose and went out, without\r\nlistening to any address.” [_Memoires de Montglat,_ t. ii.]  The\r\nsovereign courts had learned to improve upon the old maxim of Matthew\r\nMole: “I am going to court; I shall tell the truth; after which the king\r\nmust be obeyed.”  Not a tongue wagged, and obedience at length was\r\nrendered to Cardinal Mazarin as it had but lately been to Cardinal\r\nRichelieu.\r\n\r\nThe court was taking its diversion.  “There were plenty of fine comedies\r\nand ballets going on.  The king, who danced very well, liked them\r\nextremely,” says Mdlle. de Montpensier, at that time exiled from Paris;\r\n“all this did not affect me at all; I thought that I should see enough of\r\nit on my return; but my ladies were different, and nothing could equal\r\ntheir vexation at not being in all these gayeties.”  It was still worse\r\nwhen announcement was made of the arrival of Queen Christina of Sweden,\r\nthat celebrated princess, who had reigned from the time she was six years\r\nold, and had lately abdicated, in 1654, in favor of her cousin, Charles\r\nGustavus, in order to regain her liberty, she said, but perhaps, also,\r\nbecause she found herself confronted by the ever-increasing opposition of\r\nthe grandees of her kingdom, hostile to the foreign fashions favored by\r\nthe queen, as well as to the design that was attributed to her of\r\nbecoming converted to Catholicism.  When Christina arrived at Paris, in\r\n1656, she had already accomplished her abjuration at Brussels, without\r\nassigning her motives for it to anybody.  “Those who talk of them know\r\nnothing about them,” she would say; “and she who knows something about\r\nthem has never talked of them.”  There was great curiosity at Paris to\r\nsee this queen.  The king sent the Duke of Guise to meet her, and he\r\nwrote to one of his friends as follows:\r\n\r\n“She is not tall, she has a good arm, a hand white and well made, but\r\nrather a man’s than a woman’s, a high shoulder,--a defect which she\r\nso well conceals by the singularity of her dress, her walk, and her\r\ngestures, that you might make a bet about it.  Her face is large without\r\nbeing defective, all her features are the same and strongly marked, a\r\npretty tolerable turn of countenance, set off by a very singular\r\nhead-dress; that is, a man’s wig, very big, and very much raised in\r\nfront; the top of the head is a tissue of hair, and the back has\r\nsomething of a woman’s style of head-dress.  Sometimes she also wears a\r\nhat; her bodice, laced behind, crosswise, is made something like our\r\ndoublets, her chemise bulging out all round her petticoat, which she\r\nwears rather badly fastened and not over straight.  She is always very\r\nmuch powdered, with a good deal of pomade, and almost never puts on\r\ngloves.  She has, at the very least, as much swagger and haughtiness as\r\nthe great Gustavus, her father, can have had; she is mighty civil and\r\ncoaxing, speaks eight languages, and principally French, as if she had\r\nbeen born in Paris.  She knows as much about it as all our Academy and\r\nthe Sorbonne put together, has an admirable knowledge of painting as well\r\nas of everything else, and knows all the intrigues of our court better\r\nthan I.  In fact, she is quite an extraordinary person.”  “The king,\r\nthough very timid at that time,” says Madame de Motteville, “and not at\r\nall well informed, got on so well with this bold, well-informed, and\r\nhaughty princess, that, from the first moment, they associated together\r\nwith much freedom and pleasure on both sides.  It was difficult, when you\r\nhad once had a good opportunity of seeing her, and above all of listening\r\nto her, not to forgive all her irregularities, though some of them were\r\nhighly blamable.”  All the court and all Paris made a great fuss about\r\nthis queen, who insisted upon going everywhere, even to the French\r\nAcademy, where no woman had ever been admitted.  Patru thus relates to\r\none of his friends the story of her visit: “No notice was given until\r\nabout eight or nine in the morning of this princess’s purpose, so that\r\nsome of our body could not receive information in time.  M. de Gombault\r\ncame without having been advertised; but, as soon as he knew of the\r\nqueen’s purpose, he went away again, for thou must know that he is wroth\r\nwith her because, he having written some verses in which he praised the\r\ngreat Gustavus, she did not write to him, she who, as thou knowest, has\r\nwritten to a hundred impertinent apes.  I might complain, with far more\r\nreason; but, so long as kings, queens, princes, and princesses do me only\r\nthat sort of harm, I shall never complain.  The chancellor [Seguier, at\r\nwhose house the Academy met] had forgotten to have the portrait of this\r\nprincess, which she had given to the society, placed in the room; which,\r\nin my opinion, ought not to have been forgotten.  Word was brought that\r\nthe carriage was entering the court-yard.  The chancellor, followed by\r\nthe whole body, went to receive the princess.  .  .  .  As soon as she\r\nentered the room, she went off-hand, according to her habit, and sat down\r\nin her chair; and, at the same moment, without any order given us, we\r\nalso sat down.  The princess, seeing that we were at some little distance\r\nfrom the table, told us that we could draw up close to it.  There was\r\nsome little drawing up, but not as if it were a dinner-party.  .  .  .\r\nSeveral pieces were read; and then the director, who was M. de la\r\nChambre, told the queen that the ordinary exercise of the society was to\r\nwork at the Dictionary, and that, if it were agreeable to her Majesty, a\r\nsheet should be read.  ‘By all means,’ said she.  M. de Mezeray,\r\naccordingly, read the word Jeux, under which, amongst other proverbial\r\nexpressions, there was, _‘Jeux de princes, qui ne plaisent qu’a ceux qui\r\nles font.’ (Princes’ jokes, which amuse only those who make them.)_  She\r\nburst out laughing.  The word, which was in fair copy, was finished.  It\r\nwould have been better to read a word which had to be weeded, because\r\nthen we should all have spoken; but people were taken by surprise--the\r\nFrench always are.  .  .  .  After about an hour, the princess rose, made\r\na courtesy to the company, and went away as she had come.  Here is really\r\nwhat passed at this famous interview, which, no doubt, does great honor\r\nto the Academy.--The Duke of Anjou talks of coming to it, and the zealous\r\nare quite transported with this bit of glory.”  [_OEuvres diverses de\r\nPatru,_ t. ii.  p. 512.]\r\n\r\nQueen Christina returned the next year and passed some time at\r\nFontainebleau.  It was there, in a gallery that King Louis Philippe\r\ncaused to be turned into apartments, which M. Guizot at one time\r\noccupied, that she had her first equerry, Monaldeschi, whom she accused\r\nof having betrayed her, assassinated almost before her own eyes; and she\r\nconsidered it astonishing, and very bad taste, that the court of France\r\nshould be shocked at such an execution.  “This barbarous princess,” says\r\nMadame de Motteville, “after so cruel an action as that, remained in her\r\nroom laughing and chatting as easily as if she had done something of no\r\nconsequence or very praiseworthy.  The queen-mother, a perfect Christian,\r\nwho had met with so many enemies whom she might have punished, but who\r\nhad received from her nothing but marks of kindness, was scandalized by\r\nit.  The king and Monsieur blamed her, and the minister, who was not a\r\ncruel man, was astounded.”\r\n\r\nThe queen-mother had other reasons for being less satisfied than she had\r\nbeen at the first trip of Queen Christina of Sweden.  The young king\r\ntestified much inclination for Mary de Mancini, Cardinal Mazarin’s niece,\r\na bold and impassioned creature, whose sister Olympia had already found\r\nfavor in his eyes before her marriage with the Count of Soissons.  The\r\neldest of all had married the Duke of Mercceur, son of the Duke of\r\nVendome; the other two were destined to be united, at a later period, to\r\nthe Dukes of Bouillon and La Meilleraye; the hopes of Mary went still\r\nhigher; relying on the love of young Louis XIV., she dared to dream of\r\nthe throne; and the Queen of Sweden encouraged her.  “The right thing is\r\nto marry one’s love,” she told the king.  No time was lost in letting\r\nChristina understand that she could not remain long in France: the\r\ncardinal, “with a moderation for which he cannot be sufficiently\r\ncommended,” says Madame de Motteville, “himself put obstacles in the way\r\nof his niece’s ambitious designs; he sent her to the convent of Brouage,\r\nthreatening, if that exile were not sufficient, to leave France and take\r\nhis niece with him.”\r\n\r\n“No power,” he said to the king, “can wrest from me the free authority of\r\ndisposal which God and the laws give me over my family.”  “You are king;\r\nyou weep; and yet I am going away!” said the young girl to her royal\r\nlover, who let her go.  Mary de Mancini was mistaken; he was not yet\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin----394]\r\n\r\nCardinal Mazarin and the queen had other views regarding the marriage of\r\nLouis XIV.; for a long time past the object of their labors had been to\r\nterminate the war by an alliance with Spain.  The Infanta, Maria Theresa,\r\nwas no longer heiress to the crown, for King Philip at last had a son;\r\nSpain was exhausted by long-continued efforts, and dismayed by the checks\r\nreceived in the, campaign of 1658; the alliance of the Rhine, recently\r\nconcluded at Frankfurt between the two leagues, Catholic and Protestant,\r\nconfirmed immutably the advantages which the treaty of Westphalia had\r\nsecured to France.  The electors had just raised to the head of the\r\nempire young Leopold I., on the death of his father, Ferdinand III., and\r\nthey proposed their mediation between France and Spain.  Whilst King\r\nPhilip IV. was still hesitating, Mazarin took a step in another\r\ndirection; the king set out for Lyons, accompanied by his mother and his\r\nminister, to go and see Princess Margaret of Savoy, who had been proposed\r\nto him a long time ago as his wife.  He was pleased with her, and\r\nnegotiations were already pretty far advanced, to the great displeasure\r\nof the queen-mother, when the cardinal, on the 29th of November, 1659, in\r\nthe evening, entered Anne of Austria’s room.  “He found her pensive and\r\nmelancholy, but he was all smiles. ‘Good news, madam,’ said he.  ‘Ah!’\r\ncried the queen, ‘is it to be peace?’  ‘More than that, Madame; I bring\r\nyour Majesty both peace and the Infanta.’”  The Spaniards had become\r\nuneasy; and Don Antonio de Pimentel had arrived at Lyons at the same time\r\nwith the court of Savoy, bearing a letter from Philip IV. for the queen\r\nhis sister.  The Duchess of Savoy had to depart and take her daughter\r\nwith her, disappointed of her hopes; all the consolation she obtained was\r\na written promise that the king would marry Princess Margaret, if the\r\nmarriage with the Infanta were not accomplished within a year.\r\n\r\nThe year had not yet rolled away, and the Duchess of Savoy had already\r\nlost every atom of illusion.  Since the 13th of August, Cardinal Mazarin\r\nhad been officially negotiating with Don Louis de Haro, representing\r\nPhilip IV.  The ministers had held a meeting in the middle of the\r\nBidassoa, on the Island of Pheasants, where a pavilion had been erected\r\non the boundary-line between the two states.  On the 7th of November the\r\npeace of the Pyrenees was signed at last; it put an end to a war which\r\nhad continued for twenty-three years, often internecine, always\r\nburdensome, and which had ruined the finances of the two countries.\r\nFrance was the gainer of Artois and Roussillon, and of several places in\r\nFlanders, Hainault, and Luxembourg; and the peace of Westphalia was\r\nrecognized by Spain, to whom France restored all that she held in\r\nCatalonia and in Franche-Comte.  Philip IV. had refused to include\r\nPortugal in the treaty.  The Infanta received as dowry five hundred\r\nthousand gold crowns, and renounced all her rights to the throne of\r\nSpain; the Prince of  Conde was taken back to favor by the king, and\r\ndeclared that he would fain redeem with his blood all the hostilities he\r\nhad committed in and out of France.  The king restored him to all his\r\nhonors and dignities, gave him the government of Burgundy, and bestowed\r\non his son, the Duke of Enghien, the office of Grand Master of France.\r\nThe honor of the King of Spain was saved, he did not abandon his allies,\r\nand he made a great match for his daughter.  But the eyes of Europe were\r\nnot blinded; it was France that triumphed; the policy of Cardinal\r\nRichelieu and of Cardinal Mazarin was everywhere successful.  The work of\r\nHenry IV. was completed, the house of Austria was humiliated and\r\nvanquished in both its branches; the man who had concluded the peace of\r\nWestphalia and the peace of the Pyrenees had a right to say, “I am more\r\nFrench in heart than in speech.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Conde returned to court, “as if he had never gone away,”\r\n says Mdlle. de Montpensier.  [_Memoires,_ t. iii.  p. 451.]  “The king\r\ntalked familiarly with him of all that he had done both in France and in\r\nFlanders, and that with as much gusto as if all those things had taken\r\nplace for his service.”  “The prince discovered him to be so great in\r\nevery point that, from the first moment at which he could approach him,\r\nhe comprehended, as it appeared, that the time had come to humble\r\nhimself.  That genius for sovereignty and command which God had implanted\r\nin the king, and which was beginning to show itself, persuaded the Prince\r\nof Conde that all which remained of the previous reign was about to be\r\nannihilated.”  [_Memoires de Madame de Motteville,_ t. v.  p. 39.]  From\r\nthat day King Louis XIV. had no more submissive subject than the great\r\nConde.\r\n\r\nThe court was in the South, travelling from town to town, pending the\r\narrival of the dispensations from Rome.  On the 3d of June, 1660, Don\r\nLouis de Haro, in the name of the King of France, espoused the Infanta in\r\nthe church of Fontfrabia.  Mdlle. de Montpensier made up her mind to be\r\npresent, unknown to anybody, at the ceremony.  When it was over, the new\r\nqueen, knowing that the king’s cousin was there, went up to her, saying,\r\n“I should like to embrace this fair unknown,” and led her away to her\r\nroom, chatting about everything, but pretending not to know her.  The\r\nqueen-mother and King Philip IV. met next day, on the Island of\r\nPheasants, after forty-five years’ separation.  The king had come\r\nprivately to have a view of the Infanta, and he watched her, through a\r\ndoor ajar, towering a whole head above the courtiers.  “May I, ask my\r\nniece what she thinks of this unknown?” said Anne of Austria to her\r\nbrother.  “It will be time when she has passed that door,” replied the\r\nking.  Young Monsieur, the king’s brother, leaned forward towards his\r\nsister-in-law, and, “What does your Majesty think of this door?” he\r\nwhispered.  “I think it very nice and handsome,” answered the young\r\nqueen.  The king had thought her handsome, “despite the ugliness of her\r\nhead-dress and of her clothes, which had at first taken him by surprise.”\r\n King Philip IV. kept looking at M. de Turenne, who had accompanied the\r\nking.  “That man has given me dreadful times,” he repeated twice or\r\nthrice.  “You can judge whether M. de Turenne felt himself offended,”\r\n says Mdlle. de Montpensier.  The definitive marriage took place at\r\nSaint-Jean-de-Luz on the 9th of June, and the court took the road\r\nleisurely back to Vincennes.  Scarcely had the arrival taken place, when\r\nall the sovereign bodies sent a solemn deputation to pay their respects\r\nto Cardinal Mazarin and thank him for the peace he had just concluded.\r\nIt was an unprecedented honor, paid to a minister upon whose head the\r\nParliament had but lately set a price.  The cardinal’s triumph was as\r\ncomplete at home as abroad; all foes had been reduced to submission or\r\nsilence, Paris and France rejoicing over the peace and the king’s\r\nmarriage; but, like Cardinal Richelieu, Mazarin succumbed at the very\r\npinnacle of his glory and power; the gout, to which he was subject, flew\r\nto his stomach, and he suffered excruciating agonies.  One day, when the\r\nking came to get his advice upon a certain matter, “Sir,” said the\r\ncardinal, “you are asking counsel of a man who no longer has his reason\r\nand who raves.”  He saw the approach of death calmly, but not\r\nunregretfully.  Concealed, one day, behind a curtain in the new\r\napartments of the Mazarin Palace (now the National Library), young\r\nBrienne heard the cardinal coming.  “He dragged his slippers along like a\r\nman very languid and just recovering from some serious illness.  He\r\npaused at every step, for he was very feeble; he fixed his gaze first on\r\none side and then on the other, and letting his eyes wander over the\r\nmagnificent objects of art he had been all his life collecting, he said,\r\n‘All that must be left behind!’  And, turning round, he added, ‘And that\r\ntoo!  What trouble I have had to obtain all these things!  I shall never\r\nsee them more where I am going.’”  He had himself removed to Vincennes,\r\nof which he was governor.  There he continued to regulate all the affairs\r\nof state, striving to initiate the young king in the government.\r\n“Nobody,” Turenne used to say, “works so much as the cardinal, or\r\ndiscovers so many expedients with great clearness of mind for the\r\nterminating of much business of different sorts.”  The dying minister\r\nrecommended to the king MM. Le Tellier and de Lionne, and he added, “Sir,\r\nto you I owe everything; but I consider that I to some extent acquit\r\nmyself of my obligation to your Majesty by giving you M. Colbert.”  The\r\ncardinal, uneasy about the large possessions he left, had found a way of\r\nsecuring them to his heirs by making, during his lifetime, a gift of the\r\nwhole of them to the king.  Louis XIV. at once returned it.  The minister\r\nhad lately placed his two nieces, the Princess of Conti and the Countess\r\nof Soissons, at the head of the household of two queens; he had married\r\nhis niece, Hortensia Mancini, to the Duke of La Meilleraye, who took the\r\ntitle of Duke of Mazarin.  The father of this duke was the relative and\r\nprotege of Cardinal Richelieu, for whom Mazarin had always preserved a\r\nfeeling of great gratitude.  It was to him and his wife that he left the\r\nremainder of his vast possessions, after having distributed amongst all\r\nhis relatives liberal bequests to an enormous amount.  The pictures and\r\njewels went to the king, to Monsieur, and to the queens.  A considerable\r\nsum was employed for the foundation and endowment of the _College des\r\nQuatre Nations (now the Palais de l’Institut),_ intended for the\r\neducation of sixty children of the four provinces re-united to France by\r\nthe treaties of Westphalia and the Pyrenees, Alsace, Roussillon, Artois,\r\nand Pignerol.  The cardinal’s fortune was estimated at fifty millions.\r\n\r\nMazarin had scarcely finished making his final dispositions when his\r\nmalady increased to a violent pitch.  “On the 5th of March, forty hours’\r\npublic prayers were ordered in all the churches of Paris, which is not\r\ngenerally done except in the case of kings,” says Madame de Motteville.\r\nThe cardinal had sent for M. Jolt, parish-priest of St. Nicholas des\r\nChamps, a man of great reputation for piety, and begged him not to leave\r\nhim.  “I have misgivings about not being sufficiently afraid of death,”\r\n he said to his confessor.  He felt his own pulse himself, muttering quite\r\nlow, “I shall have a great deal more to suffer.”  The king had left him\r\non the 7th of March, in the evening.  He did not see him again and sent\r\nto summon the ministers.  Already the living was taking the place of the\r\ndying, with a commencement of pomp and circumstance which excited wonder\r\nat the changes of the world.  “On the 9th, between two and three in the\r\nmorning, Mazarin raised himself slightly in his bed, praying to God and\r\nsuffering greatly; then he said aloud, ‘Ah holy Virgin, have pity upon\r\nme; receive my soul,’ and so he expired, showing a fair front to death up\r\nto the last moment.”  The queen-mother had left her room for the last\r\ntwo, days, because it was too near that of the dying man.  “She wept less\r\nthan the king,” says Madame de Motteville, “being more disgusted with the\r\ncreatures of his making by reason of the knowledge she had of their\r\nimperfections, insomuch that it was soon easy to see that the defects of\r\nthe dead man would before long appear to her greater than they had yet\r\nbeen in her eyes, for he did not content himself with exercising\r\nsovereign power over the whole realm, but he exercised it over the\r\nsovereigns themselves who had given it him, not leaving them liberty to\r\ndispose of anything of any consequence.”  [_Memoires de Madame de\r\nMotteville,_ t. v.  p. 103.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Death of Mazarin.----399]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. was about to reign with a splendor and puissance without\r\nprecedent; his subjects were submissive and Europe at peace; he was\r\nreaping the fruits of the labors of his grandfather Henry IV., of\r\nCardinal Richelieu, and of Cardinal Mazarin.  Whilst continuing the work\r\nof Henry IV. Richelieu had rendered possible the government of Mazarin;\r\nhe had set the kingly authority on foundations so strong that the princes\r\nof the blood themselves could not shake it.  Mazarin had destroyed party\r\nand secured to France a glorious peace.  Great minister had succeeded\r\ngreat king, and able man great minister; Italian prudence, dexterity, and\r\nfinesse had replaced the indomitable will, the incomparable judgment, and\r\nthe grandeur of view of the French priest and nobleman.  Richelieu and\r\nMazarin had accomplished their patriotic work: the king’s turn had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.----LOUIS XIV., HIS WARS AND HIS CONQUESTS. 1661-1697.\r\n\r\nCardinal Mazarin on his death-bed had given the young king this advice:\r\n“Manage your affairs yourself, sir, and raise no more premier ministers\r\nto where your bounties have placed me; I have discovered, by what I might\r\nhave done against your service, how dangerous it is for a king to put his\r\nservants in such a position.”  Mazarin knew thoroughly the king whose\r\nbirth he had seen.  “He has in him the making of four kings and one\r\nhonest man,” he used to say.  Scarcely was the minister dead, when Louis\r\nXIV. sent to summon his council: Chancellor Seguier, Superintendent\r\nFouquet, and Secretaries of State Le Tellier, de Lionne, Brienne,\r\nDuplessis-Gueneguaud, and La Vrilliere.  Then, addressing the chancellor,\r\n“Sir,” said he, “I have had you assembled together with my ministers and\r\nmy secretaries of state to tell you that until now I have been well\r\npleased to leave my affairs to be governed by the late cardinal; it is\r\ntime that I should govern them myself; you will aid me with your counsels\r\nwhen I ask for them.  Beyond the general business of the seal, in which\r\nI do not intend to make any alteration, I beg and command you,\r\nMr. Chancellor, to put the seal of authority to nothing without my orders\r\nand without having spoken to me thereof, unless a secretary of state\r\nshall bring them to you on my behalf.  .  .  .  And for you, gentlemen,”\r\n addressing the secretaries of state, “I warn you not to sign anything,\r\neven a safety-warrant or passport, without my command, to report every\r\nday to me personally, and to favor nobody in your monthly rolls.  Mr.\r\nSuperintendent, I have explained to you my intentions; I beg that you\r\nwill employ the services of M. Colbert, whom the late cardinal\r\nrecommended to me.”\r\n\r\nThe king’s councillors were men of experience; and they, all recognized\r\nthe master’s tone.  From timidity or respect, Louis XIV. had tolerated\r\nthe yoke of Mazarin, not, however, without impatience and in expectation\r\nof his own turn.  [_Portraits de la Cour, Archives curieuses,_ t. viii.\r\np. 371.]  “The cardinal,” said he one day, “does just as he pleases, and\r\nI put up with it because of the good service he has rendered me, but I\r\nshall be master in my turn;” and he added, “the king my grandfather did\r\ngreat things, and left some to do; if God gives me grace to live twenty\r\nyears longer, perhaps I may do as much or more.”  God was to grant Louis\r\nXIV. more time and power than he asked for, but it was Henry IV.’s good\r\nfortune to maintain his greatness at the sword’s point, without ever\r\nhaving leisure to become intoxicated with it.  Absolute power is in its\r\nnature so unwholesome and dangerous that the strongest mind cannot always\r\nwithstand it.  It was Louis XIV.’s misfortune to be king for seventy-two\r\nyears, and to reign fifty-six as sovereign master.\r\n\r\n“Many people made up their minds,” says the king in his _Memoires_\r\n[t. ii.  p. 392], “that my assiduity in work was but a heat which would\r\nsoon cool; but time showed them what to think of it, for they saw me\r\nconstantly going on in the same way, wishing to be informed of all that\r\ntook place, listening to the prayers and complaints of my meanest\r\nsubjects, knowing the number of my troops and the condition of my\r\nfortresses, treating directly with foreign ministers, receiving\r\ndespatches, making in person part of the replies and giving my\r\nsecretaries the substance of the others, regulating the receipts and\r\nexpenditures of my kingdom, having reports made to myself in person\r\nby those who were in important offices, keeping my affairs secret,\r\ndistributing graces according to my own choice, reserving to myself alone\r\nall my authority, and confining those who served me to a modest position\r\nvery far from the elevation of premier ministers.”\r\n\r\nThe young king, from the first, regulated his life and his time: “I laid\r\nit down as a law to myself,” he says in his _Instructions au Dauphin,_\r\n“to work regularly twice a day.  I cannot tell you what fruit I reaped\r\nimmediately after this resolution.  I felt myself rising as it were both\r\nin mind and courage; I found myself quite another being; I discovered in\r\nmyself what I had no idea of, and I joyfully reproached myself for having\r\nbeen so long ignorant of it.  Then it dawned upon me that I was king, and\r\nwas born to be.”\r\n\r\nA taste for order and regularity was natural to Louis XIV., and he soon\r\nmade it apparent in his councils.  “Under Cardinal Mazarin, there was\r\nliterally nothing but disorder and confusion; he had the council held\r\nwhilst he was being shaved and dressed, without ever giving anybody a\r\nseat, not even the chancellor or Marshal Villeroy, and he was often\r\nchattering with his linnet and his monkey all the time he was being\r\ntalked to about business.  After Mazarin’s death the king’s council\r\nassumed a more decent form.  The king alone was seated, all the others\r\nremained standing, the chancellor leaned against the bedrail, and M. de\r\nLionne upon the edge of the chimney-piece.  He who was making a report\r\nplaced himself opposite the king, and, if he had to write, sat down on a\r\nstool which was at the end of the table where there was a writing-desk\r\nand paper.”  [_Histoire de France,_ by Le P.  Daniel, t. xvi.  p. 89.] ”\r\n I will settle this matter with your Majesty’s ministers,” said the\r\nPortuguese ambassador one day to the young king.  “I have no ministers,\r\nMr. Ambassador,” replied Louis XIV.; “you mean to say my men of\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\nLong habituation to the office of king was not destined to wear out, to\r\nexhaust, the youthful ardor of King Louis XIV.  He had been for a long\r\nwhile governing, when he wrote, “You must not imagine, my son, that\r\naffairs of state are like those obscure and thorny passages in the\r\nsciences which you will perhaps have found fatiguing, at which the mind\r\nstrives to raise itself, by an effort, beyond itself, and which repel us\r\nquite as much by their, at any rate apparent, uselessness as by their\r\ndifficulty.  The function of kings consists principally in leaving good\r\nsense to act, which always acts naturally without any trouble.  All that\r\nis most necessary in this kind of work is at the same time agreeable; for\r\nit is, in a word, my son, to keep an open eye over all the world, to be\r\ncontinually learning news from all the provinces and all nations, the\r\nsecrets of all courts, the temper and the foible of all foreign princes\r\nand ministers, to be informed about an infinite number of things of which\r\nwe are supposed to be ignorant, to see in our own circle that which is\r\nmost carefully hidden from us, to discover the most distant views of our\r\nown courtiers and their most darkly cherished interests which come to us\r\nthrough contrary interests, and, in fact, I know not what other pleasure\r\nwe would not give up for this, even if it were curiosity alone that\r\ncaused us to feel it.”  [_Memoires de Louis XIV.,_ t. ii.  p. 428.]\r\n\r\nAt twenty-two years of age, no more than during the rest of his life, was\r\nLouis XIV. disposed to sacrifice business to pleasure, but he did not\r\nsacrifice pleasure to business.  It was on a taste so natural to a young\r\nprince, for the first time free to do as he pleased, that Superintendent\r\nFouquet counted to increase his influence and probably his power with the\r\nking.  “The attorney-general [Fouquet was attorney-general in the\r\nParliament of Paris], though a great thief, will remain master of the\r\nothers,” the queen-mother had said to Madame de Motteville at the time of\r\nMazarin’s death.  Fouquet’s hopes led him to think of nothing less than\r\nto take the minister’s place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fouquet----404]\r\n\r\nFouquet, who was born in 1615, and had been superintendent of finance in\r\nconjunction with Servien since 1655, had been in sole possession of that\r\noffice since the death of his colleague in 1659.  He had faithfully\r\nserved Cardinal Mazarin through the troubles of the Fronde.  The latter\r\nhad kept him in power in spite of numerous accusations of malversation\r\nand extravagance.  Fouquet, however, was not certain of the cardinal’s\r\ngood faith; he bought Belle-Ile to secure for himself a retreat, and\r\nprepared, for his personal defence, a mad project which was destined\r\nsubsequently to be his ruin.  From the commencement of his reign, the\r\ncounsels of Mazarin on his death-bed, the suggestions of Colbert, the\r\nfirst observations made by the king himself, irrevocably ruined Fouquet\r\nin the mind of the young monarch.  Whilst the superintendent was dreaming\r\nof the ministry and his friends calling him _the Future,_ when he was\r\npreparing, in his castle of Vaux-le-Vicomte, an entertainment in the\r\nking’s honor at a cost of forty thousand crowns, Louis XIV., in concert\r\nwith Colbert, had resolved upon his ruin.  The form of trial was decided\r\nupon.  The king did not want to have any trouble with the Parliament; and\r\nColbert suggested to Fouquet the idea of ridding himself of his office of\r\nattorney-general.  Achille de Harlay bought it for fourteen hundred\r\nthousand livres; a million in ready money was remitted to the king for\r\nhis Majesty’s urgent necessities; the superintendent was buying up\r\neverybody, even the king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colbert----405]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of August, 1661, the whole court thronged the gardens of\r\nVaux, designed by Le Netre; the king, whilst admiring the pictures of Le\r\nBrun, the _Facheux_ of Moliere represented that day for the first time,\r\nand the gold and silver plate which encumbered the tables, felt his\r\ninward wrath redoubled.  “Ah!  Madame,” he said to the queen his mother,\r\n“shall not we make all these fellows disgorge?”  He would have had the\r\nsuperintendent arrested in the very midst of those festivities, the very\r\nsplendor of which was an accusation against him.  Anne of Austria,\r\ninclined in her heart to be indulgent towards Fouquet, restrained him.\r\n“Such a deed would scarcely be to your honor, my son,” she said;\r\n“everybody can see that this poor man is ruining himself to give you good\r\ncheer, and you would have him arrested in his own house!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vaux le Vicomte----405a]\r\n\r\n“I put off the execution of my design,” says Louis XIV. in his Memoires,\r\n“which caused me incredible pain, for I saw that during that time he was\r\npractising new devices to rob me.  You can imagine that at the age I then\r\nwas it required my reason to make a great effort against my feelings in\r\norder to act with so much self-control.  All France commended especially\r\nthe secrecy with which I had for three or four months kept a resolution\r\nof that sort, particularly as it concerned a man who had such special\r\naccess to me, who had dealings with all that approached me, who received\r\ninformation from within and from without the kingdom, and who, of\r\nhimself, must have been led by the voice of his own conscience to\r\napprehend everything.”  Fouquet apprehended and became reassured by\r\nturns; the king, he said, had forgiven him all the disorder which the\r\ntroubles of the times and the absolute will of Mazarin had possibly\r\ncaused in the finances.  However, he was anxious when he followed Louis\r\nXIV. to Nantes, the king being about to hold an assembly of the states of\r\nBrittany.  “Nantes, Belle-Ile!  Nantes, Belle-Ile!” he kept repeating.\r\nOn arriving, Fouquet was ill and trembled as if he had the ague; he did\r\nnot present himself to the king.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of September, in the evening, the king himself wrote to the\r\nqueen-mother: “My dear mother, I wrote you word this morning about the\r\nexecution of the orders I had given to have the superintendent arrested;\r\nyou know that I have had this matter for a long while on my mind, but it\r\nwas impossible to act sooner, because I wanted him first of all to have\r\nthirty thousand crowns paid in for the marine, and because, moreover, it\r\nwas necessary to see to various matters which could not be done in a day;\r\nand you cannot imagine the difficulty I had in merely finding means of\r\nspeaking in private to D’Artagnan.  I felt the greatest impatience in the\r\nworld to get it over, there being nothing else to detain me in this\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis XIV. dismissing Fouquet----407]\r\n\r\nAt last, this morning, the superintendent having come to work with me as\r\nusual, I talked to him first of one matter and then of another, and made\r\na show of searching for papers, until, out of the window of my closet, I\r\nsaw D’Artagnan in the castle-yard; and then I dismissed the\r\nsuperintendent, who, after chatting a little while at the bottom of the\r\nstaircase with La Feuillade, disappeared during the time he was paying\r\nhis respects to M. Le Tellier, so that poor D’Artagnan thought he had\r\nmissed him, and sent me word by Maupertuis that he suspected that\r\nsomebody had given him warning to look to his safety; but he caught him\r\nagain in the place where the great church stands, and arrested him for me\r\nabout midday.  They put the superintendent into one of my carriages,\r\nfollowed by my musketeers, to escort him to the castle of Angers, whilst\r\nhis wife, by my orders, is off to Limoges.  .  .  .  I have told those\r\ngentlemen who are here with me that I would have no more superintendents,\r\nbut myself take the work of finance in conjunction with faithful persons\r\nwho will do nothing without me, knowing that this is the true way to\r\nplace myself in affluence and relieve my people.  During the little\r\nattention I have as yet given thereto, I observed some important matters\r\nwhich I did not at all understand.  You will have no difficulty in\r\nbelieving that there have been many people placed in a great fix; but I\r\nam very glad for them to see that I am not such a dupe as they supposed,\r\nand that the best plan is to hold to me.”\r\n\r\nThree years were to roll by before the end of Fouquet’s trial.  In vain\r\nhad one of the superintendent’s valets, getting the start of all the\r\nking’s couriers, shown sense enough to give timely warning to his\r\ndistracted friends; Fouquet’s papers were seized, and very compromising\r\nthey were for him as well as for a great number of court-personages, of\r\nboth sexes.  Colbert prosecuted the matter with a rigorous justice that\r\nlooked very like hate; the king’s self-esteem was personally involved in\r\nprocuring the condemnation of a minister guilty of great extravagances\r\nand much irregularity rather than of intentional want of integrity.\r\nPublic feeling was at first so greatly against the superintendent that\r\nthe peasants shouted to the musketeers told off to escort him from Angers\r\nto the Bastille, “No fear of his escaping; we would hang him with our own\r\nhands.”  But the length and the harshness of the proceedings, the efforts\r\nof Fouquet’s family and friends, the wrath of the Parliament, out of\r\nwhose hands the case had been taken in favor of carefully chosen\r\ncommissioners, brought about a great change; of the two prosecuting\r\ncounsel (_conseillers rapporteurs_), one, M. de Sainte-Helene, was\r\ninclined towards severity; the other, Oliver d’Ormesson, a man of\r\nintegrity and courage, thought of nothing but justice, and treated with\r\ncontempt the hints that reached him from the court.  Colbert took the\r\ntrouble one day to go and call upon old M. d’Ormesson, the counsel’s\r\nfather, to complain of the delays that the son, as he said, was causing\r\nin the trial: “It is very extraordinary,” said the minister, “that a\r\ngreat king, feared throughout Europe, cannot finish a case against one of\r\nhis own subjects.”  “I am sorry,” answered the old gentleman, “that the\r\nking is not satisfied with my son’s conduct; I know that he practises\r\nwhat I have always taught him,--to fear God, serve the king, and render\r\njustice without respect of persons.  The delay in the matter does not\r\ndepend upon him; he works at it night and day, without wasting a moment.”\r\n Oliver d’Ormesson lost the stewardship of Soissonness, to which he had\r\nthe titular right, but he did not allow himself to be diverted from his\r\nscrupulous integrity.  Nay, he grew wroth at the continual attacks of\r\nChancellor Seguier, more of a courtier than ever in his old age, and\r\nanxious to finish the matter to the satisfaction of the court.  “I told\r\nmany of the Chamber,” he writes, “that I did not like to have the whip\r\napplied to me every morning, and that the chancellor was a sort of\r\nchastiser I would not put up with.”  [_Journal d’ Oliver d’ Ormesson,_\r\nt. ii.  p. 88.]\r\n\r\nFouquet, who claimed the jurisdiction of the Parliament, had at first\r\nrefused to answer the interrogatory; it was determined to conduct his\r\ncase “as if he were dumb,” but his friends had him advised not to persist\r\nin his silence.  The courage and presence of mind of the accused more\r\nthan once embarrassed his judges.  The ridiculous scheme which had been\r\ndiscovered behind a looking-glass in Fouquet’s country-house was read;\r\nthe instructions given to his friends in case of his arrest seemed to\r\nforeshadow a rebellion; Fouquet listened, with his eyes bent upon the\r\ncrucifix.  “You cannot be ignorant that this is a state-crime,” said the\r\nchancellor.  “I confess that it is outrageous, sir,” replied the accused;\r\n“but it is not a state-crime.  I entreat these gentlemen,” turning to the\r\njudges, “to kindly allow me to explain what a state-crime is.  It is when\r\nyou hold a chief office, when you are in the secrets of your prince, and\r\nwhen, all at once, you range yourself on the side of his enemies, enlist\r\nall your family in the same interest, cause the passes to be given up by\r\nyour son-in-law, and the gates to be opened to a foreign army, so as to\r\nintroduce it into the heart of the kingdom.  That, gentlemen, is what is\r\ncalled a state-crime.”  The chancellor could not protest; nobody had\r\nforgotten his conduct during the Fronde.  M. d’Ormesson summed up for\r\nbanishment, and confiscation of all the property of the accused; it was\r\nall that the friends of Fouquet could hope for.  M. de Sainte-Helene\r\nsummed up for beheadal.  “The only proper punishment for him would be\r\nrope and gallows,” exclaimed M. Pussort, the most violent of the whole\r\ncourt against the accused; “but, in consideration of the offices he has\r\nheld, and the distinguished relatives he has, I relent so far as to\r\naccept the opinion of M. de Sainte-Helene.”  “What say you to this\r\nmoderation?” writes Madame de Sevigne to M. de Pomponne, like herself a\r\nfaithful friend of Fouquet’s: “it is because he is Colbert’s uncle, and\r\nwas objected to, that he was inclined for such handsome treatment.  As\r\nfor me, I am beside myself when I think of such infamy.  .  .  .  You\r\nmust know that M. Colbert is in such a rage that there is apprehension\r\nof some atrocity and injustice which will drive us all to despair.  If it\r\nwere not for that, my poor dear sir, in the position in which we now are,\r\nwe might hope to see our friend, although very unfortunate, at any rate\r\nwith his life safe, which is a great matter.”\r\n\r\n“Pray much to your God and entreat your judges,” was the message sent to\r\nMesdames Fouquet by the queen-Snother, “for, so far as the king is\r\nconcerned, there is nothing to be expected.”  “If he is sentenced,\r\nI shall leave him to die,” proclaimed Louis XIV.  Fouquet was not\r\nsentenced; the court declared for the view of Oliver d’Ormesson.  “Praise\r\nGod, sir, and thank Him,” wrote Madame de Sevigne, on the 20th of\r\nDecember, 1664, “our poor friend is saved; it was thirteen for M.\r\nd’Ormesson’s summing-up, and nine for Sainte-He1ene’s.  It will be a long\r\nwhile before I recover from my joy; it is really too overwhelming; I can\r\nhardly restrain it.  The king changes exile into imprisonment, and\r\nrefuses him permission to see his wife, which is against all usage; but\r\ntake care not to abate one jot of your joy; mine is increased thereby,\r\nand makes me see more clearly the greatness of our victory.”  Fouquet was\r\ntaken to Pignerol, and all his family were removed from Paris.  He died\r\npiously in his prison, in 1680, a year before his venerable mother, Marie\r\nMaupeou, who was so deeply concerned about her son’s soul at the very\r\npinnacle of greatness, that she threw herself upon her knees on hearing\r\nof his arrest, and exclaimed, I thank thee, O God; I have always prayed\r\nfor his salvation, and here is the way to it!”  Fouquet was guilty; the\r\nbitterness of his enemies and the severities of the king have failed to\r\nprocure his acquittal from history any more than from his judges.\r\n\r\nEven those who, like Louis XIV. and Colbert, saw the canker in the state,\r\ndeceived themselves as to the resources at their disposal for the cure of\r\nit; the punishment of the superintendent and the ruin of the farmers of\r\ntaxes (traitants) might put a stop for a while to extravagances; the\r\npowerful hand of Colbert might re-establish order in the finances, found\r\nnew manufactures, restore the marine, and protect commerce; but the order\r\nwas but momentary, and the prosperity superficial, as long as the\r\nsovereign’s will was the sole law of the state.  Master as he was over\r\nthe maintenance of peace in Europe, after so many and such long periods\r\nof hostility, young Louis XIV.  was only waiting for an opportunity of\r\nrecommencing war.  “ The resolutions I had in my mind seemed to me very\r\nworthy of execution,” he says: “my natural activity, the ardor of my age,\r\nand the violent desire I felt to augment my reputation, made me very\r\nimpatient to be up and doing; but I found at this moment that love of\r\nglory has the same niceties, and, if I may say so, the same timidities,\r\nas the most tender passions; for, the more ardent I was to distinguish\r\nmyself, the more apprehensive I was of failing, and, regarding as a great\r\nmisfortune the shame which follows the slightest errors, I intended, in\r\nmy conduct, to take the most extreme precautions.”\r\n\r\nThe day of reverses was farther off from Louis XIV. than that of errors.\r\nGod had vouchsafed him incomparable instruments for the accomplishment of\r\nhis designs.  Whilst Colbert was replenishing the exchequer, all the\r\nwhile diminishing the imposts, a younger man than the king himself, the\r\nMarquis of Louvois, son of Michael Le Tellier, admitted to the council at\r\ntwenty years of age, was eagerly preparing the way for those wars which\r\nwere nearly always successful so long as he lived, however insufficient\r\nwere the reasons for them, however unjust was their aim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louvois----411]\r\n\r\nForeign affairs were in no worse hands than the administration of finance\r\nand of war.  M. de Lionne was an able diplomatist, broken in for a long,\r\ntime past to important affairs, shrewd and sensible, more celebrated\r\namongst his contemporaries than in history, always falling into the\r\nsecond rank, behind Mazarin or Louis XIV., “who have appropriated his\r\nfame,” says M. Mignet.  The negotiations conducted by M. de Lionne were\r\nof a delicate nature.  Louis XIV. had never renounced the rights of the\r\nqueen to the succession in Spain.  King Philip IV. had not paid his\r\ndaughter’s dowry, he said; the French ambassador at Madrid, the\r\nArchbishop of Embrun, was secretly negotiating to obtain a revocation of\r\nMaria Theresa’s renunciation, or, at the very least, a recognition of the\r\nright of devolution over the Catholic Low Countries.  This strange\r\ncustom of Hainault secured to the children of the first marriage\r\nsuccession to the paternal property, to the exclusion of the offspring of\r\nthe second marriage.  Louis XIV. claimed the application of it to the\r\nadvantage of the queen his wife, daughter of Elizabeth of France.  “It is\r\nabsolutely necessary that justice should sooner or later be done the\r\nqueen, as regards the rights that may belong to her, or that I should try\r\nto exact it myself,” wrote Louis XIV. to the Archbishop of Embrun.  This\r\njustice and these rights were, sooth to say, the pivot of all the\r\nnegotiations and all the wars of King Louis XIV.  “I cannot, all in a\r\nmoment, change from white to black all the ancient maxims of this crown,”\r\n said the king.  He obtained no encouragement from Spain, and he began to\r\nmake preparations, in anticipation, for war.\r\n\r\nIn this view and with these prospects, he needed the alliance of the\r\nHollanders.  Shattered as it had been by the behavior of the United\r\nProvinces at the Congress of Munster and by their separate peace with\r\nSpain, the friendship between the States General and France had been\r\nre-soldered by the far-sighted policy of John Van Witt, grand pensionary\r\nof Holland, and preponderant, with good right, in the policy of his\r\ncountry.  Bold and prudent, courageous and wise, he had known better than\r\nanybody how to estimate the true interests of Holland, and how to\r\nmaintain them everywhere, against Cromwell as well as Mazarin, with\r\nhigh-spirited moderation.  His great and cool judgment had inclined him\r\ntowards France, the most useful ally Holland could have.  In spite of the\r\ndifficulties put in the way of their friendly relations by Colbert’s\r\ncommercial measures, a new treaty was concluded between Louis XIV. and\r\nthe United Provinces.  “I am informed from a good quarter,” says a letter\r\nto John van Witt from his ambassador at Paris, Boreel, June 8, 1662,\r\n“that his Majesty makes quite a special case of the new alliance between\r\nhim and their High Mightinesses, which he regards as his own particular\r\nwork.  He expects great advantages from it as regards the security of his\r\nkingdom and that of the United Provinces, which, he says, he knows to\r\nhave been very affectionately looked upon by Henry the Great and he\r\ndesires that, if their High Mightinesses looked upon his ancestor as a\r\nfather, they should love him from this moment as a son, taking him for\r\ntheir best friend and principal ally.”  A secret negotiation was at the\r\nsame time going on between John van Witt and Count d’Estrades, French\r\nambassador in Holland, for the formation and protection of a Catholic\r\nrepublic in the Low Countries, according to Richelieu’s old plan, or for\r\npartition between France and the United Provinces.  John van Witt was\r\nanxious to act; but Louis XIV. seemed to be keeping himself hedged, in\r\nview of the King of Spain’s death, feeling it impossible, he said, with\r\npropriety and honor, to go contrary to the faith of the treaties which\r\nunited him to his father-in-law.  “That which can be kept secret for some\r\ntime cannot be forever, nor be concealed from posterity,” he said to\r\nCount d’Estrades, in a private letter: “any how, there are certain things\r\nwhich are good to do and bad to commit to writing.”  An understanding was\r\ncome to without any writing.  Louis XIV. well understood the noble heart\r\nand great mind with which he had to deal, when he wrote to Count\r\nd’Estrades, April 20, 1663, “It is clear that God caused M. de Witt to be\r\nborn [in 1632] for great things, seeing that, at his age, he has already\r\nfor many years deservedly been the most considerable person in his state;\r\nand I believe, too, that my having obtained so good a friend in him was\r\nnot a simple result of chance, but of Divine Providence, who is thus\r\nearly arranging the instruments of which He is pleased to make use for\r\nthe glory of this crown, and for the advantage of the United Provinces.\r\nThe only complaint I make of him is, that, having so much esteem and\r\naffection as I have for his person, he will not be kind enough to let me\r\nhave the means of giving him some substantial tokens of it, which I would\r\ndo with very great joy.”  Louis XIV. was not accustomed to meet, at\r\nforeign courts, with the high-spirited disinterestedness of the\r\nburgess-patrician, who, since the age of five and twenty, had been\r\ngoverning the United Provinces.\r\n\r\nThus, then, it was a case of strict partnership between France and\r\nHolland, and Louis XIV. had remained faithful to the policy of Henry IV.\r\nand Richelieu when Philip IV. died, on the 17th of September, 1665.\r\nAlmost at the same time the dissension between England and Holland, after\r\na period of tacit hostility, broke out into action.  The United Provinces\r\nclaimed the aid of France.\r\n\r\nClose ties at that time united France and England.  Monsieur, the king’s\r\nonly brother, had married Henrietta of England, sister of Charles II.\r\nThe King of England, poor and debauched, had scarcely been restored to\r\nthe throne when he sold Dunkerque to France for five millions of livres,\r\nto the great scandal of Cromwell’s old friends, who had but lately helped\r\nTurenne to wrest it from the Spaniards.  “I knew without doubt that the\r\naggression was on the part of England,” writes Louis XIV. in his\r\nMemoires, “and I resolved to act with good faith towards the Hollanders,\r\naccording to the terms of my treaty: but as I purposed to terminate the\r\nwar on the first opportunity, I resolved to act towards the English as\r\nhandsomely as could be, and I begged the Queen of England, who happened\r\nto be at that time in Paris, to signify to her son that, with the\r\nsingular regard I had for him, I could not without sorrow form the\r\nresolution which I considered myself bound by the obligation of my\r\npromise to take; for, at the origin of this war, I was persuaded that he\r\nhad been carried away by the wishes of his subjects farther than he would\r\nhave been by his own, insomuch that, between ourselves, I thought I had\r\nless reason to complain of him than for him.  It is certain that this\r\nsubordination which places the sovereign under the necessity of receiving\r\nthe law from his people is the worst calamity that can happen to a man of\r\nour rank.  I have pointed out to you elsewhere, my son, the miserable\r\ncondition of princes who commit their people and their own dignity to the\r\nmanagement of a premier minister; but it is little beside the misery of\r\nthose who are left to the indiscretion of a popular assembly; the more\r\nyou grant, the more they claim; the more you caress, the more they\r\ndespise; and that which is once in their possession is held by so many\r\narms that it cannot be wrenched away without an extreme amount of\r\nviolence.”  In his compassion for the misery of the king of a free\r\ncountry, Louis XIV. contented himself with looking on at the desperate\r\nengagements between the English and the Dutch fleets.  Twice the English\r\ndestroyed the Dutch fleet under the orders of Admiral van Tromp.  John\r\nvan Witt placed himself at the head of the squadron.  “Tromp has courage\r\nenough to fight,” he said, “but not sufficient prudence to conduct a\r\ngreat action.  The heat of battle is liable to carry officers away,\r\nconfuse them, and not leave them enough independence of judgment to bring\r\nmatters to a successful issue.  That is why I consider myself bound by\r\nall the duties of manhood and conscience to be myself on the watch, in\r\norder to set bounds to the impetuosity of valor when it would fain go too\r\nfar.”  The resolution of the grand pensionary and the skill of Admiral\r\nRuyter, who was on his return from an expedition in Africa, restored the\r\nfortunes of the Hollanders; their vessels went and offered the English\r\nbattle at the very mouth of the Thames.  The French squadron did not\r\nleave the Channel.  It was only against the Bishop of Munster, who had\r\njust invaded the Dutch territory, that Louis XIV. gave his allies\r\neffectual aid; M. de Turenne marched against the troops of the bishop,\r\nwho was forced to retire, in the month of April, 1666.  Peace was\r\nconcluded at Breda, between England and Holland, in the month of July,\r\n1667.  Louis XIV. had not waited for that moment to enter Flanders.\r\n\r\nEverything, in fact, was ready for this great enterprise: the regent of\r\nSpain, Mary Anne of Austria, a feeble creature, under the thumb of one\r\nFather Nithard, a Jesuit, had allowed herself to be sent to sleep by the\r\nskilful manoeuvres of the Archbishop of Embrun; she had refused to make a\r\ntreaty of alliance with England and to recognize Portugal, to which Louis\r\nXIV. had just given a French queen, by marrying Mdlle. de Nemours to King\r\nAlphonso VI.  The league of the Rhine secured to him the neutrality, at\r\nthe least, of Germany; the emperor was not prepared for war; Europe,\r\ndivided between fear and favor, saw with astonishment Louis XIV. take the\r\nfield in the month of May, 1667.  “It is not,” said the manifesto sent by\r\nthe king to the court of Spain, “either the ambition of possessing new\r\nstates, or the desire of winning glory by arms, which inspires the Most\r\nChristian King with the design of maintaining the rights of the queen his\r\nwife; but would it not be shame for a king to allow all the privileges of\r\nblood and of law to be violated in the persons of himself, his wife, and\r\nhis son?  As king, he feels himself obliged to prevent this injustice;\r\nas master, to oppose this usurpation; and, as father, to secure the\r\npatrimony to his son.  He has no desire to employ force to open the\r\ngates, but he wishes to enter, as a beneficent sun, by the rays of his\r\nlove, and to scatter everywhere, in country, towns, and private houses,\r\nthe gentle influences of abundance and peace, which follow in his train.”\r\n To secure the gentle influences of peace, Louis XIV. had collected an\r\narmy of fifty thousand men, carefully armed and equipped under the\r\nsupervision of Turenne, to whom Louvois as yet rendered docile obedience.\r\nThere was none too much of this fine army for recovering the queen’s\r\nrights over the duchy of Brabant, the marquisate of Antwerp, Limburg,\r\nHainault, the countship of Namur, and other territories.  “Heaven not\r\nhaving ordained any tribunal on earth at which the Kings of France can\r\ndemand justice, the Most Christian King has only his own arms to look to\r\nfor it,” said the manifesto.  Louis XIV. set out with M. de Turenne.\r\nMarshal Crequi had orders to observe Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were taken unprepared: Armentieres, Charleroi, Douai, and\r\nTournay had but insufficient garrisons, and they fell almost without\r\nstriking a blow.  Whilst the army was busy with the siege of Courtray,\r\nLouis XIV. returned to Compiegne to fetch the queen.  The whole court\r\nfollowed him to the camp.  “All that you have read about--the\r\nmagnificence of Solomon and the grandeur of the King of Persia, is not to\r\nbe compared with the pomp that attends the king in his expedition,” says\r\na letter to Bussy-Rabutin from the Count of Coligny.  “You see passing\r\nalong the streets nothing but plumes, gold-laced uniforms, chariots,\r\nmules superbly harnessed, parade-horses, housings with embroidery of fine\r\ngold.”  “I took the queen to Flanders,” says Louis XIV., “to show her to\r\nthe peoples of that country, who received her, in point of fact, with all\r\nthe delight imaginable, testifying their sorrow at not having had more\r\ntime to make preparations for receiving her more befittingly.”  The\r\nqueen’s quarters were at Courtrai.  Marshal Turenne had moved on\r\nDendermonde, but the Flemings had opened their sluices; the country was\r\ninundated; it was necessary to fall back on Audenarde; the town was taken\r\nin two days; and the king, still attended by the court, laid siege to\r\nLille.  Vauban, already celebrated as an engineer, traced out the lines\r\nof circumvallation; the army of M. de Crequi formed a junction with that\r\nof Turenne; there was expectation of an attempt on the part of the\r\ngovernor of the Low Countries to relieve the place; the Spanish force\r\nsent for that purpose arrived too late, and was beaten on its retreat;\r\nthe burgesses of Lille had forced the garrison to capitulate; and Louis\r\nXIV. entered it on the 27th of August, after ten days’ open trenches.  On\r\nthe 2d of September, the king took the road back to St. Germain; but\r\nTurenne still found time to carry the town of Alost before taking up his\r\nwinter-quarters.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV.’s first campaign had been nothing but playing at war, almost\r\nentirely without danger or bloodshed; it had, nevertheless, been\r\nsufficient to alarm Europe.  Scarcely had peace been concluded at Breda,\r\nwhen another negotiation was secretly entered upon between England,\r\nHolland, and Sweden.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that King Charles II. leaned personally towards an\r\nalliance with France; his people had their eyes “opened to the dangers”\r\n --incurred by Europe from the arms of Louis XIV.  “Certain persons of the\r\ngreatest influence in Parliament come sometimes to see me, without any\r\nlights and muffled in a cloak in order not to be recognized,” says a\r\nletter of September 26, 1669, from the Marquis of Ruvigny to M. de\r\nLionne; “they give me to understand that common sense and the public\r\nsecurity forbid them to see, without raising a finger, the whole of the\r\nLow Countries taken, and that they are bound in good policy to oppose the\r\npurposes of this conquest if his Majesty intend to take all for himself.”\r\n On the 23d of January, 1668, the celebrated treaty of the Triple Alliance\r\nwas signed at the Hague.  The three powers demanded of the King of France\r\nthat he should grant the Low Countries a truce up to the month of May, in\r\norder to give time for treating with Spain and obtaining from her, as\r\nFrance demanded, the definitive cession of the conquered places or\r\nFranche-Comte in exchange.  At bottom, the Triple Alliance was resolved\r\nto protect helpless Spain against France; a secret article bound the\r\nthree allies to take up arms to restrain Louis XIV., and to bring him\r\nback, if possible, to the peace of the Pyrenees.  At the same moment,\r\nPortugal was making peace with Spain, who recognized her independence.\r\n\r\nThe king refused the long armistice demanded of him.  “I will grant it up\r\nto the 31st of March,” he had said, “being unwilling to miss the first\r\nopportunity of taking the field.”  The Marquis of Castel-Rodriguo made\r\nmerry over this proposal.  “I am content,” said he, “with the suspension\r\nof arms that winter imposes upon the King of France.”  The governor of\r\nthe Low Countries made a mistake: Louis XIV. was about to prove that his\r\nsoldiers, like those of Gustavus Adolphus, did not recognize winter.  He\r\nhad intrusted the command of his new army to the Prince of Conde,\r\namnestied for the last nine years, but, up to that time, a stranger to\r\nthe royal favor.  Conde expressed his gratitude with more fervor than\r\nloftiness when he wrote to the king on the 20th of December, 1667, “My\r\nbirth binds me more than any other to your Majesty’s service, but the\r\nkindnesses and the confidence you deign to show me after I have so little\r\ndeserved them bind me still more than my birth.  Do me the honor to\r\nbelieve, sir, that I hold neither property nor life but to cheerfully\r\nsacrifice them for your glory and for the preservation of your person,\r\nwhich is a thousand times dearer to me than all the things of the world.”\r\n\r\n“On pretence of being in Burgundy at the states,” writes Oliver\r\nd’Ormesson, the prosecutor of Fouquet, “the prince had obtained perfect\r\nknowledge that Franche-Comte was without troops and without apprehension,\r\nbecause they had no doubt that the king would accord them neutrality as\r\nin the last war, the inhabitants having sent to him to ask it of him.  He\r\nkept them amused.  Meanwhile the king had set his army in motion without\r\ndisclosing his plan, and the inhabitants of Franche-Comte found\r\nthemselves attacked without having known that they were to be.  Besancon\r\nand Salins surrendered at sight of the troops.  The king, on arriving,\r\nwent to Dole, and superintended an affair of counterscarps and some\r\ndemilunes, whereat there were killed some four or five hundred men.  The\r\ninhabitants, astounded, and finding themselves without troops or hope of\r\nsuccor, surrendered on Shrove Tuesday, February 14.  The king at the same\r\ntime marched to Gray.  The governor made some show of defending himself,\r\nbut the Marquis of Yenne, governor-general under Castel-Rodriguo, who\r\nbelongs to the district and has all his property there, came and\r\nsurrendered to the king, and then, having gone to Gray, persuaded the\r\ngovernor to surrender.  Accordingly, the king entered it on Sunday,\r\nFebruary 19, and had a Te Deum sung there, having at his right the\r\ngovernor-general, and at his left the special governor of the town; and,\r\nthe same day, he set out on his return.  And so, within twenty-two days\r\nof the month of February, he had set out from St. Germain, been in\r\nFranche-Comte, taken it entirely, and returned to St. Germain.  This is a\r\ngreat and wonderful conquest from every point of view.  Having paid a\r\nvisit to the prince to make my compliments, I said that the glory he had\r\nwon had cost him dear, as he had lost his shoes; he replied, laughing,\r\nthat it had been said so, but the truth was, that, happening to be at the\r\nguards’ attack, somebody came and told him that the king had pushed\r\nforward to M. de Gadaignes’ attack, that he had ridden up full gallop to\r\nbring back the king, who had put himself in too great peril, and that,\r\nhaving dismounted at a very moist spot, his shoe had come off, and he had\r\nbeen obliged to re-shoe himself in the king’s presence.”  [_Journal d’\r\nOliver d’ Ormesson,_ t.  ii.  p.  542.]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. had good reason to “push forward to the attack and put himself\r\nin too great peril;” a rumor had circulated that, having run the same\r\nrisk at the siege of Lille, he had let a moment’s hesitation appear; the\r\nold Duke of Charost, captain of his guards, had come up to him, and,\r\n“Sir,” he had whispered in the young king’s ear, “the wine is drawn, and\r\nit must be drunk.”  Louis XIV. had finished his reconnoissance, not\r\nwithout a feeling of gratitude towards Charost for preferring before his\r\nlife that honor which ended by becoming his idol.\r\n\r\nThe king was back at St. Germain, preparing enormous armaments for the\r\nmonth of April.  He had given the Prince of Conde the government of\r\nFranche-Comte.  “I had always esteemed your father,” he said to the young\r\nDuke of Enghien, “but I had never loved him; now I love him as much as I\r\nesteem him.”  Young Louvois, already in high favor with the king, as well\r\nas his father, Michael Le Tellier, had contributed a great deal towards\r\ngetting the prince’s services appreciated; they still smarted under the\r\nreproaches of M. de Turenne touching the deficiency of supplies for the\r\ntroops before Lille in 1667.\r\n\r\nWar seemed to be imminent; the last days of the armistice were at hand.\r\n“The opinion prevailing in France as to peace is a disease which is\r\nbeginning to spread very much,” wrote Louvois in the middle of March,\r\n“but we shall soon find a cure for it, as here is the time approaching\r\nfor taking the field.  You must publish almost everywhere that it is the\r\nSpaniards who do not want peace.”  Louvois lied brazenfacedly; the\r\nSpaniards were without resources, but they had even less of spirit than\r\nof resources; they consented to the abandonment of all the places won in\r\nthe Low Countries during 1667.  A congress was opened at Aix-la-Chapelle,\r\npresided over by the nuncio of the new pope, Clement IX., as favorable to\r\nFrance as his predecessor, Innocent X., had been to Spain.  “A phantom\r\narbiter between phantom plenipotentiaries,” says Voltaire, in the Siecle\r\nde Louis XIV.  The real negotiations were going on at St. Germain.\r\n“I did not look merely,” writes Louis XIV., “to profit by the present\r\nconjuncture, but also to put myself in a position to turn to my advantage\r\nthose which might probably arrive.  In view of the great increments that\r\nmy fortune might receive, nothing seemed to me more necessary than to\r\nestablish for myself amongst my smaller neighbors such a character for\r\nmoderation and probity as might assuage in them those emotions of dread\r\nwhich everybody naturally experiences at sight of too great a power.\r\nI was bound not to lack means of breaking with Spain when I pleased;\r\nFranche-Comte, which I gave up, might become reduced to such a condition\r\nthat I should be master of it at any moment, and my new conquests, well\r\nsecured, would open for me a surer entrance into the Low Countries.”\r\n Determined by these wise motives, the king gave orders to sign the peace.\r\n“M. de Turenne appeared yesterday like a man who had received a blow from\r\na club,” writes Michael Le Tellier to his son: “when Don Juan arrives,\r\nmatters will change; he says that, meanwhile, all must go on just the\r\nsame, and he repeated it more than a dozen times, which made the prince\r\nlaugh.”  Don Juan did not protest, and on the 2d of May, 1668, the peace\r\nof Aix-la-Chapelle was concluded.  Before giving up Franche-Comte, the\r\nking issued orders for demolishing the fortifications of Dole and Gray;\r\nhe at the same time commissioned Vauban to fortify Ath, Lille, and\r\nTournay.  The Triple Alliance was triumphant, the Hollanders at the head.\r\n“I cannot tell your Excellency all that these beer-brewers write to our\r\ntraders,” said a letter to M. de Lionne from one of his correspondents;\r\n“as there is just now nothing further to hope for, in respect of they Low\r\nCountries, I vent all my feelings upon the Hollanders, whom I hold at\r\nthis day to be our most formidable enemies, and I exhort your Excellency,\r\nas well for your own reputation as for the public satisfaction, to omit\r\nfrom your policy nothing that may tend to the discovery of means to abase\r\nthis great power, which exalts itself too much.”\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. held the same views as M. de Lionne’s correspondent, not\r\nmerely from resentment against the Hollanders, who had stopped him in his\r\ncareer of success, but because he quite saw that the key to the barrier\r\nbetween the Catholic Low Countries and himself remained in the hands of\r\nthe United Provinces.  He had relied upon his traditional influence in\r\nthe Estates as well as on the influence of John van Witt; but the\r\nlatter’s position had been shaken.  “I learn from a good quarter that\r\nthere are great cabals forming against the authority of M. de Witt, and\r\nfor the purpose of ousting him from it,” writel M. de Lionne on the 30th\r\nof March, 1668; Louis XIV. resolved to have recourse to arms in order to\r\nhumiliate this insolent republic which had dared to hamper his designs.\r\nFor four years, every effort of his diplomacy tended solely to make\r\nHolland isolated in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was to England that France would naturally first turn her eyes.  The\r\nsentiments of King Charles II. and of his people, as regarded Holland,\r\nwere not the same.  Charles had not forgiven the Estates for having\r\ndriven him from their territory at the request of Cromwell; the simple\r\nand austere manners of the republican patricians did not accord with his\r\ntaste for luxury and debauchery; the English people, on the contrary,\r\ndespite of that rivalry in, trade and on the seas which had been the\r\nsource of so much ancient and recent hostility between the two nations,\r\nesteemed the Hollanders and leaned towards an alliance with them.  Louis\r\nXIV., in the eyes of the English Parliament, was the representative of\r\nCatholicism and absolute monarchy, two enemies which it had vanquished,\r\nbut still feared.  The king’s proceedings with Charles II.  had,\r\ntherefore, necessarily to be kept secret; the ministers of the King of\r\nEngland were themselves divided; the Duke of Buckingham, as mad and as\r\nprodigal as his father, was favorable to France; the Earl of Arlington\r\nhad married a Hollander, and persisted in the Triple Alliance.  Louis\r\nXIV.  employed  in this negotiation his sister-in-law, Madame Henriette,\r\nwho was much attached to her brother, the King of England, and was\r\nintelligent and adroit; she was on her return from a trip to London,\r\nwhich she had with great difficulty snatched from the jealous\r\nsusceptibilities of Monsieur, when she died suddenly at Versailles on the\r\n30th of June, 1670.  “It were impossible to praise sufficiently the\r\nincredible dexterity of this princess in treating the most delicate\r\nmatters, in finding a remedy for those hidden suspicions which often keep\r\nthem in suspense, and in terminating all difficulties in such a manner as\r\nto conciliate the most opposite interests; this was the subject of all\r\ntalk, when on a sudden resounded, like a clap of thunder, that astounding\r\nnews, Madame is dying! Madame is dead!  And there, in spite of that great\r\nheart, is this princess, so admired and so beloved; there, as death has\r\nmade her for us!” [Bossuet, _Oraison funebre d’Henriette d’Angleterre._]\r\n\r\nMadame’s work was nevertheless accomplished, and her death was not\r\ndestined to interrupt it.  The treaty of alliance was secretly concluded,\r\nsigned by only the Catholic councillors of Charles II.; it bore that the\r\nKing of England was resolved to publicly declare his return to the\r\nCatholic church; the King of France was to aid him towards the execution\r\nof this project with assistance to the amount of two millions of livres\r\nof Tours; the two princes bound themselves to remain faithful to the\r\npeace of Aix-la-Chapelle as regarded Spain, and to declare war together\r\nagainst the United Provinces the King of France would have to supply to\r\nhis brother of England, for this war, a subsidy of three million livres\r\nof Tours every year.  When the Protestant ministers were admitted to\r\nshare the secret, silence was kept as to the declaration of Catholicity,\r\nwhich was put off till after the war in Holland; Parliament had granted\r\nthe king thirteen hundred thousand pounds sterling to pay his debts, and\r\neight hundred thousand pounds to “equip in the ensuing spring” a fleet of\r\nfifty vessels, in order that he might take the part he considered most\r\nexpedient for the glory of his kingdom and the welfare of his subjects.\r\n“The government of our country is like a great bell which you cannot stop\r\nwhen it is once set going,” said King Charles II., anxious to commence\r\nthe war in order to handle the subsidies the sooner; he was,\r\nnevertheless, obliged to wait.  Louis XIV. had succeeded in dragging him\r\ninto an enterprise contrary to the real interests of his country as well\r\nas of his national policy; in order to arrive at his ends he had set at\r\nwork all the evil passions which divided the court of England; he had\r\nbought up the king, his mistresses, and his ministers; he had dangled\r\nbefore the fanaticism of the Duke of York the spectacle of England\r\nconverted to Catholicism; but his work was not finished in Europe; he\r\nwished to assure himself of the neutrality of Germany in the great duel\r\nhe was meditating with the republic of the United Provinces.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1667 Louis XIV. had practically paved the way towards the\r\nneutrality of the empire by a secret treaty regulating the eventual\r\npartition of the Spanish, monarchy.  In case the little King of Spain\r\ndied without children, France was to receive the Low Countries, Franche-\r\nComte, Navarre, Naples, and Sicily; Austria was to keep Spain and\r\nMilaness.  The Emperor Leopold therefore turned a deaf ear to the\r\nentreaties of the Hollanders who would fain have bound him down to the\r\nTriple Alliance; a new convention between France and the empire, secretly\r\nsigned on the 1st of November, 1670, made it reciprocally obligatory on\r\nthe two princes not to aid their enemies.  The German princes were more\r\ndifficult to win over; they were beginning to feel alarm at the\r\npretensions of France.  The electors of Treves and of Mayence had already\r\ncollected some troops on the Rhine; the Duke of Lorraine seemed disposed\r\nto lend them assistance; Louis XIV. seized the pretext of the restoration\r\nof certain fortifications contrary to the treaty of Marsal; on the 23d of\r\nAugust, 1675, he ordered Marshal Crequi to enter Lorraine; at the\r\ncommencement of September, the whole duchy was reduced, and the duke a\r\nfugitive.  “The king had at first been disposed to give up Lorraine to\r\nsome one of the princes of that house,” writes Louvois; “but, just now,\r\nhe no longer considers that province to be a country which he ought to\r\nquit so soon, and it appears likely that, as he sees more and more every\r\nday how useful that conquest will be for the unification of his kingdom,\r\nhe will seek the means of preserving it for himself.”  In point of fact,\r\nthe king, in answer to the emperor’s protests, replied that he did not\r\nwant to turn Lorraine to account for his own profit, but that he would\r\nnot give it up at the solicitations of anybody.  Brandenburg and Saxony\r\nalone refused point blank to observe neutrality; France had renounced\r\nProtestant alliances in Germany, and the Protestant electors comprehended\r\nthe danger that threatened them. Sweden also comprehended it, but\r\nGustavus Adolphus and Oxenstiern were no longer there; there remained\r\nnothing but the remembrance of old alliances with France; the Swedish\r\nsenators gave themselves up to the buyer one after another. “When you\r\nhave made some stay at Stockholm,” wrote Courtin, the French ambassador\r\nin Sweden, to M. do Pomponne, “and seen the vanity of the Gascons of the\r\nNorth, the little honesty there is in their conduct, the cabals which\r\nprevail in the Senate, and the feebleness and inertness of those who\r\ncompose it, you cannot be surprised at the delays and changes which take\r\nplace.  If the Senate of Rome had shown as little inclination as that of\r\nSweden at the present time for war, the Roman empire would not have been\r\nof so great an extent.”  The treaty, however, was signed on the 14th of\r\nApril, 1672; in consideration of an annual subsidy of six hundred\r\nthousand livres Sweden engaged to oppose by arms those princes of the\r\nempire who should determine to support the United Provinces.  The gap was\r\nforming round Holland.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the secrecy which enveloped the negotiations of Louis XIV.,\r\nVan Witt was filled with disquietude; favorable as ever to the French\r\nalliance, he had sought to calm the irritation of France, which set down\r\nthe Triple Alliance to the account of Holland.  “I remarked,” says a\r\nletter in 1669, from M. de Pomponne, French ambassador at the Hague,\r\n“that it seemed to me a strange thing that, whereas this republic had two\r\nkings for its associates in the triple alliance, it affected in some sort\r\nto put itself at their head so as to do all the speaking, and that it was\r\nwilling to become the seat of all the manoeuvres that were going on\r\nagainst France, which was very likely to render it suspected of some\r\nprepossession in favor of Spain.”  John Van Witt defended his country\r\nwith dignified modesty.  “I know not whether to regard as a blessing or a\r\ncurse,” said he, “the incidents which have for several years past brought\r\nit about that the most important affairs of Europe have been transacted\r\nin Holland.  It must no doubt be attributed to the situation and\r\ncondition of this state, which, whilst putting it after all the crowned\r\nheads, cause it to be readily agreed to as a place without consequence;\r\nbut, as for the prepossession of which we are suspected in favor of\r\nSpain, it cannot surely be forgotten what aversion we have as it were\r\nsucked in with our milk towards that nation, the remnants that still\r\nremain of a hatred fed by so much blood and such long wars, which make it\r\nimpossible, for my part, that my inclinations should ever turn towards\r\nthat crown.”\r\n\r\nHatred to Spain was not so general in Holland as Van Witt represented;\r\nand internal dissensions amongst the Estates, sedulously fanned by\r\nFrance, were slowly ruining the authority of the aristocratic and\r\nrepublican party, only to increase the influence of those who favored the\r\nhouse of Nassau.  In his far-sighted and sagacious patriotism, John van\r\nWitt had for a long time past foreseen the defeat of his cause, and he\r\nhad carefully trained up the heir of the stadtholders, William of Nassau,\r\nthe natural head of his adversaries.  It was this young prince whom the\r\npolicy of Louis XIV. at that time opposed to Van Witt in the councils of\r\nthe United Provinces, thus strengthening in advance the indomitable foe\r\nwho was to triumph over all his greatness and vanquish him by dint of\r\ndefeats.  The despatch of an ambassador to Spain, to form there an\r\nalliance offensive and defensive, was decided upon.  “M. de Beverninck,\r\nwho has charge of this mission, is without doubt a man of strength and\r\nability,” said M. de Pomponne, “and there are many who put him on a par\r\nwith M. de Witt; it is true that he is not on a par with the other the\r\nwhole day long, and that with the sobriety of morning he often loses the\r\ndesert and capacity that were his up to dinner-time.”  The Spaniards at\r\nfirst gave but a cool reception to the overtures of the Hollanders.\r\n“They look at their monarchy through the spectacles of Philip II.,” said\r\nBeverninck, “and they take a pleasure in deceiving themselves whilst they\r\nflatter their vanity.”  Fear of the encroachments of France carried the\r\nday, however.  “They consider,” wrote M. de Lionne, “that, if they left\r\nthe United Provinces to ruin, they would themselves have but the favor\r\ngranted by the Cyclops, to be eaten last;” a defensive league was\r\nconcluded between Spain and Holland, and all the efforts of France\r\ncould not succeed in breaking it.\r\n\r\nJohn van Witt was negotiating in every direction.  The treaty of Charles\r\nII. with France had remained a profound secret, and the Hollanders\r\nbelieved that they might calculate upon the good-will of the English\r\nnation.  The arms of England were effaced from the Royal Charles, a\r\nvessel taken by Van Tromp in 1667, and a curtain was put over a picture,\r\nin the town-hall of Dordrecht, of the victory at Chatham, representing\r\nthe ruart [inspector of dikes] Cornelius van Witt leaning on a cannon.\r\nThese concessions to the pride of England were not made without a\r\nstruggle.  “Some,” says M. de Pomponne, “thought it a piece of baseness\r\nto despoil themselves during peace, of tokens of the glory they had won\r\nin the war; others, less sensitive on this point of delicacy, and more\r\naffected by the danger of disobliging a crown which formed the first and\r\nat this date the most necessary of their connections, preferred the less\r\nspirited but safer to the honorable but more dangerous counsels.”\r\n Charles II. played with Boreel, ambassador of the United Provinces at the\r\ncourt of London; taking advantage of the Estates’ necessity in order to\r\nserve his nephew the Prince of Orange, he demanded for him the office of\r\ncaptain-general, which had been filled by his ancestors.  Already the\r\nprince had been recognized as premier noble of Zealand, and he had\r\nobtained entrance to the council; John van Witt raised against him the\r\nvote of the Estates of Holland, still preponderant in the republic.\r\n“The grand pensionary soon appeased the murmurs and complaints that were\r\nbeing raised against him,” writes M. de Pomponne.  “He prefers the\r\ngreatest dangers to the re-estab lishment of the Prince of Orange, and to\r\nhis re-establishment on the recommendation of the King of England; he\r\nwould consider that the republic accepted a double yoke, both in the\r\nperson of a chief who, from the post of captain general, might rise to\r\nall those which his fathers had filled, and in accepting him at the\r\ninstance of a suspected crown.”  The grand pensionary did not err.  In\r\nthe spring of 1672, in spite of the loss of M. de Lionne, who died\r\nSeptember 1, 1671, all the negotiations of Louis XIV. had succeeded; his\r\narmaments were completed; he was at last about to crush that little power\r\nwhich had for so long a time past presented an obstacle to his designs.\r\n“The true way of arriving at the conquest of the Spanish Low Countries is\r\nto abase the Hollanders and annihilate them if it be possible,” said\r\nLouvois to the Prince of Conde on the 1st of November, 1671; and the king\r\nwrote in an unpublished memorandum, “In the midst of all my successes\r\nduring my campaign of 1667, neither England nor the empire, convinced as\r\nthey were of the justice of my cause, whatever interest they may have had\r\nin checking the rapidity of my conquests, offered any opposition.  I\r\nfound in my path only my good, faithful, and old friends the Hollanders,\r\nwho, instead of interesting themselves in my fortune as the foundation\r\nof their dominion, wanted to impose laws upon me and oblige me to make\r\npeace, and even dared to use threats in case I refused to accept their\r\nmediation.  I confess that their insolence touched me to the quick, and\r\nthat, at the risk of whatever might happen to my conquests in the Spanish\r\nLow Countries, I was very near turning all my forces against this proud\r\nand ungrateful nation; but, having summoned prudence to my aid, and\r\nconsidered that I had neither number of troops nor quality of allies\r\nrequisite for such an enterptise, I dissimulated, I concluded peace on\r\nhonorable conditions, resolved to put off the punishment of such perfidy\r\nto another time.”  The time had come; to the last attempt towards\r\nconciliation, made by Van Groot, son of the celebrated Grotius, in the\r\nname of the States General, the king replied with threatening\r\nhaughtiness.  “When I discovered that the United Provinces were trying to\r\ndebauch my allies, and were soliciting kings, my relatives, to enter into\r\noffensive leagues against me, I made up my mind to put myself in a\r\nposition to defend myself, and I levied some troops; but I intend to have\r\nmore by the spring, and I shall make use of them at that time in the\r\nmanner I shall consider most proper for the welfare of my dominions and\r\nfor my own glory.”\r\n\r\n“The king starts to-morrow, my dear daughter,” writes Madame de Sevigne\r\nto Madame de Grignan on the 27th of April “there will be a hundred\r\nthousand men out of Paris; the two armies will form a junction; the king\r\nwill command Monsieur, Monsieur the prince, the prince M. de Turenne, and\r\nM. de Turenne the two marshals and even the army of Marshal Crequi.  The\r\nking spoke to M. de Bellefonds and told him that his desire was that he\r\nshould obey M. de Turenne without any fuss.  The marshal, without asking\r\nfor time (that was his mistake), said that he should not be worthy of the\r\nhonor his Majesty had done him if he dishonored himself by an obedience\r\nwithout precedent.  Marshal d’Humieres and Marshal Crequi said much the\r\nsame.  M. de la Rochefoucauld says that Bellefonds has spoilt everything\r\nbecause he has no joints in his mind.  Marshal Crequi said to the king,\r\n‘Sir, take from me my baton, for are you not master?  Let me serve this\r\ncampaign as Marquis of Crequi; perhaps I may deserve that your Majesty\r\ngive me back the baton at the end of the war.’  The king was touched; but\r\nthe result is, that they have all three been at their houses in the\r\ncountry planting cabbages (have ceased to serve).”\r\n\r\n“You will permit me to tell you that there is nothing for it but to obey\r\na master who says that he means to be obeyed,” wrote Louvois to M. de\r\nCrequi.  The king wanted to have order and one sole command in his army:\r\nand he was right.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange, who had at last been appointed captain-general for\r\na single campaign, possessed neither the same forces nor the same\r\nauthority; the violence of party-struggles had blinded patriotic\r\nsentiment and was hampering the preparations for defence.  Out of\r\nsixty-four thousand troops inscribed on the registers of the Dutch army,\r\na great number neglected the summons; in the towns, the burgesses rose\r\nup against the magistrates, refusing to allow the faubourgs to be pulled\r\ndown, and the peasants threatened to defend the dikes and close the\r\nsluices.”  When word was sent yesterday to the peasants to come and work\r\non the Rhine at the redoubts and at piercing the dikes, not a man\r\npresented himself,” says a letter of June 28, from John van Witt to his\r\nbrother Cornelius; “all is disorder and confusion here.”  “I hope that,\r\nfor the moment, we shall not lack gunpowder,” said Beverninck; “but as\r\nfor guncarriages there is no help for it; a fortnight hence we shall not\r\nhave more than seven.”  Louvois had conceived the audacious idea of\r\npurchasing in Holland itself the supplies of powder and ball necessary\r\nfor the French army and the commercial instincts of the Hollanders had\r\nprevailed over patriotic sentiment.  Ruyter was short of munitions in\r\nthe contest already commenced against the French and English fleet.\r\n“Out of thirty-two battles I have been in I never saw any like it,” said\r\nthe Dutch admiral after the battle of Soultbay (Solebay) on the 7th of\r\nJune. “Ruyter is admiral, captain, pilot, sailor, and soldier all in\r\none,” exclaimed the English.  Cornelius van Witt in the capacity of\r\ncommissioner of the Estates had remained seated on the deck of the\r\nadmiral’s vessel during the fight, indifferent to the bullets that\r\nrained around him.  The issue of the battle was indecisive; Count\r\nd’Estrees, at the head of the French flotilla, had taken little part\r\nin the action.\r\n\r\nIt was not at sea and by the agency of his lieutenants that Louis XIV.\r\naspired to gain the victory; he had already arrived at the banks of the\r\nRhine, marching straight into the very heart of Holland.  “I thought it\r\nmore advantageous for my designs, and less common on the score of glory,”\r\n he wrote to Colbert on the 31st of May, “to attack four places at once on\r\nthe Rhine, and to take the actual command in person at all four sieges...\r\n.  I chose, for that purpose, Rheinberg, Wesel, Burick, and Orsoy, and I\r\nhope that there will be no complaint of my having deceived public\r\nexpectation.”  The four places did not hold out four days.  On the 12th\r\nof June, the king and the Prince of Conde appeared unexpectedly on the\r\nright bank of the intermediary branch of the Rhine, between the Wahal and\r\nthe Yssel.  The Hollanders were expecting the enemy at the ford of, the\r\nYssel, being more easy to pass; they were taken by surprise; the king’s\r\ncuirassier regiment dashed into the river, and crossed it partly by\r\nfording and partly by swimming; the resistance was brief; meanwhile the\r\nDuke of Longueville was killed, and the Prince of Conde was wounded for\r\nthe first time in his life.  “I was present at the passage, which was\r\nbold, vigorous, full of brilliancy, and glorious for the nation,” writes\r\nLouis XIV.  Arnheim and Deventer had just surrendered to Turenne and\r\nLuxembourg; Duisbourg resisted the king for a few days; Monsieur was\r\nbesieging Zutphen.  John van Witt was for evacuating the Hague and\r\nremoving to Amsterdam the centre of government and resistance; the Prince\r\nof Orange had just abandoned the province of Utrecht, which was\r\nimmediately occupied by the French; the defensive efforts were\r\nconcentrated upon the province of Holland; already Naarden, three leagues\r\nfrom Amsterdam, was in the king’s hands.  “We learn the surrender of\r\ntowns before we have heard of their investment,” wrote Van Witt.  A\r\ndeputation from the States was sent on the 22d of June to the king’s\r\nheadquarters to demand peace.  Louis XIV. had just entered Utrecht,\r\nwhich, finding itself abandoned, opened its gates to him.  On the same\r\nday, John van Witt received in a street of the Hague four stabs with a\r\ndagger from the hand of an assassin, whilst the city of Amsterdam, but\r\nlately resolved to surrender and prepared to send its magistrates as\r\ndelegates to Louis XIV., suddenly decided upon resistance to the bitter\r\nend.  “ If we must perish, let us at any rate be the last to fall,”\r\n exclaimed the town-councillor Walkernier, “and let us not submit to the\r\nyoke it is desired to impose upon us until there remain no means of\r\nsecuring ourselves against it.”  All the sluices were opened and the\r\ndikes cut.  Amsterdam floated amidst the waters.  “I thus found myself\r\nunder the necessity of limiting my conquests, as regarded the province of\r\nHolland, to Naarden, Utrecht, and Werden,” writes Louis XIV. in his\r\nunpublished Memoire touching the campaign of 1672, and he adds, with rare\r\nimpartiality, “the resolution to place the whole country under water was\r\nsomewhat violent; but what would not one do to save one’s self from\r\nforeign domination?  I cannot help admiring and commending the zeal and\r\nstout-heartedness of those who broke off the negotiation of Amsterdam,\r\nthough their decision, salutary as it was for their country, was very\r\nprejudicial to my service; the proposals made to me by the deputies from\r\nthe States General were very advantageous, but I could never prevail upon\r\nmyself to accept them.”\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. was as yet ignorant what can be done amongst a proud people by\r\npatriotism driven to despair; the States General offered him Maestricht,\r\nthe places on the Rhine, Brabant and Dutch Flanders, with a war-indemnity\r\nof ten millions; it was an open door to the Spanish Low Countries, which\r\nbecame a patch enclosed by French possessions; but the king wanted to\r\nannihilate the Hollanders; he demanded Southern Gueldres, the Island of\r\nBonmel, twenty-four millions, the restoration of Catholic worship, and,\r\nevery year, an embassy commissioned to thank the king for having a second\r\ntime given peace to the United Provinces.  This was rather too much; and,\r\nwhilst the deputies were negotiating with heavy hearts, the people of\r\nHolland had risen in wrath.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the war, the party of the house of Nassau had\r\nnever ceased to gain ground.  John van Witt was accused of all the\r\nmisfortunes of the state; the people demanded with loud outcries the\r\nrestoration of the stadtholderate, but lately abolished by a law voted by\r\nthe States under the presumptuous title of perpetual edict.  Dordrecht,\r\nthe native place of the Van Witts, gave the signal of insurrection.\r\nCornelius van Witt, who was confined to his house by illness, yielded to\r\nthe prayers of his wife and children, and signed the municipal act which\r\ndestroyed his brother’s work; the contagion spread from town to town,\r\nfrom province to province; on the 4th of July the States General\r\nappointed William of Orange stadtholder, captain-general, and admiral of\r\nthe Union; the national instinct had divined the savior of the country,\r\nand with tumultuous acclamations placed in his hands the reins of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William III., Prince of Orange----434]\r\n\r\nWilliam of Orange was barely two and twenty when the fate of revolutions\r\nsuddenly put him at the head of a country invaded, devastated, half\r\nconquered; but his mind as well as his spirit were up to the level of his\r\ntask.  He loftily rejected at the assembly of the Estates the proposals\r\nbrought forward in the king’s name by Peter van Groot.  “To subscribe\r\nthem would be suicide,” he said: “even to discuss them is dangerous; but,\r\nif the majority of this assembly decide otherwise, there remains but one\r\ncourse for the friends of Protestantism and liberty, and that is, to\r\nretire to the colonies in the West Indies, and there found a new country,\r\nwhere their consciences and their persons will be beyond the reach of\r\ntyranny and despotism.”  The States General decided to “reject the hard\r\nand intolerable conditions proposed by their lordships the Kings of\r\nFrance and Great Britain, and to defend this state and its inhabitants\r\nwith all their might.”  The province of Holland in its entirety followed\r\nthe example of Amsterdam; the dikes were everywhere broken down, at the\r\nsame time that the troops of the electors of Brandenburg and Saxony were\r\nadvancing to the aid of the United Provinces, and that the emperor was\r\nsigning with those two princes a defensive alliance for the maintenance\r\nof the treaties of Westphalia, the Pyrenees, and Aix-la-Chapelle.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. could no longer fly from conquest to conquest; henceforth his\r\ntroops had to remain on observation; care for his pleasures recalled him\r\nto France; he left the command-in-chief of his army to M. de Turenne, and\r\nset out for St.  Germain, where he arrived on the 1st of August.  Before\r\nleaving Holland, he had sent home almost without ransom twenty thousand\r\nprisoners of war, who before long entered the service of the States\r\nagain.  “It was an excess of clemency of which I had reason afterwards\r\nto repent,” says the king himself.  His mistake was, that he did not\r\nunderstand either Holland or the new chief she had chosen.\r\n\r\nDispirited and beaten, like his country, John van Witt had just given in\r\nhis resignation as councillor pensionary of Holland.  He wrote to Ruyter\r\non the 5th of August, as follows: “The capture of the towns on the Rhine\r\nin so short a time, the irruption of the enemy as far as the banks of the\r\nYssel, and the total loss of the provinces of Gueldres, Utrecht, and\r\nOver-Yssel, almost without resistance and through unheard-of poltroonery,\r\nif not treason, on the part of certain people, have more and more\r\nconvinced me of the truth of what was in olden times applied to the Roman\r\nrepublic: _Successes are claimed by everybody, reverses are put down to\r\none (Prospera omnes sibi vindicant, adversa uni imputantur)_.  That is my\r\nown experience.  The people of Holland have not only laid at my door all\r\nthe disasters and calamities that have befallen our republic; they have\r\nnot been content to see me fall unarmed and defenceless into the hands of\r\nfour individuals whose design was to murder me; but when, by the agency\r\nof Divine Providence, I escaped the assassins’ blows and had recovered\r\nfrom my wounds, they conceived a violent hatred against such of their\r\nmagistrates as they believed to have most to do with the direction of\r\npublic affairs; it is against me chiefly that this hatred has manifested\r\nitself, although I was nothing but a servant of the state; it is this\r\nthat has obliged me to demand my discharge from the office of\r\ncouncillor-pensionary.”  He was at once succeeded by Gaspard van Fagel,\r\npassionately devoted to the Prince of Orange.\r\n\r\nPopular passion is as unjust as it is violent in its excesses.  Cornelius\r\nvan Witt, but lately sharing with his brother the public confidence, had\r\njust been dragged, as a criminal, to the Hague, accused by a wretched\r\nbarber of having planned the assassination of the Prince of Orange.  In\r\nvain did the magistrates of the town of Dordrecht claim their right of\r\njurisdiction over their fellow-citizen.  Cornelius van Witt was put to\r\nthe torture to make him confess his crime.  ‘You will not force me to\r\nconfess a thing I never even thought of,” he said, whilst the pulleys\r\nwere dislocating his limbs.  His baffled judges heard him repeating\r\nHorace’s ode: _Just um et tenacem propositi virum_.  .  .  .  At the end\r\nof three hours he was carried back to his cell, broken but indomitable.\r\nThe court condemned him to banishment; his accuser, Tichelaer, was not\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nBefore long, at his instigation, the mob collected about the prison,\r\nuttering imprecations against the judges and their clemency.  “They are\r\ntraitors!” cried Tichelaer, “but let us first take vengeance on those\r\nwhom we have.”  John van Witt had been brought to the prison by a message\r\nsupposed to have come from the ruart.  In vain had his daughter conjured\r\nhim not to respond to it.  “What are you come here for?” exclaimed\r\nCornelius, on seeing his brother enter.  “Did you not send for me?”\r\n “No, certainly not.”  Then we are lost,” said John van Witt, calmly.  The\r\nshouts of the crowd redoubled; a body of cavalry still preserved order; a\r\nrumor suddenly spread that the peasants from the environs were marching\r\non the Hague to plunder it; the States of Holland sent orders to the\r\nCount of Tilly to move against them; the brave soldier demanded a written\r\norder.  “I will obey,” he said, “but the two brothers are lost.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Brothers Witt----436]\r\n\r\nThe troops had scarcely withdrawn, and already the doors of the prison\r\nwere forced; the ruart, exhausted by the torture, was stretched upon his\r\nbed, whilst his brother sat by his side reading the Bible aloud; the\r\nmadmen rushed into the chamber, crying, “Traitors, prepare yourselves;\r\nyou are going to die.”  Cornelius van Witt started up, joining his hands\r\nin prayer; the blows aimed at him did not reach him.  John was wounded.\r\nThey were both dragged forth; they embraced one another; Cornelius,\r\nstruck from behind, rolled to the bottom of the staircase; his brother\r\nwould have defended him; as he went out into the street, he received a\r\npike-thrust in the face; the ruart was dead already; the murderers vented\r\ntheir fury on John van Witt; he had lost nothing of his courage or his\r\ncoolness, and, lifting his arms towards heaven, he was opening his mouth\r\nin prayer to God, when a last pistol-shot stretched him upon his back.\r\n“There’s the perpetual edict floored!” shouted the assassins, lavishing\r\nupon the two corpses insults and imprecations.  It was only at night, and\r\nafter having with difficulty recognized them, so disfigured had they\r\nbeen, that poor Jacob van Witt was able to have his sons’ bodies removed;\r\nhe was before long to rejoin them in everlasting rest.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Orange arrived next day at the Hague, too late for his fame,\r\nand for the punishment of the obscure assassins, whom he allowed to\r\nescape.  The compassers of the plot obtained before long appointments and\r\nrewards.  “He one day assured me,” says Gourville, “that it was quite\r\ntrue he had not given any orders to have the Witts killed, but that,\r\nhaving heard of their death without having contributed to it, he had\r\ncertainly felt a little relieved.”  History and the human heart have\r\nmysteries which it is not well to probe to the bottom.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years John van Witt had, been the most noble exponent of his\r\ncountry’s traditional policy.  Long faithful to the French alliance, he\r\nhad desired to arrest Louis XIV. in his dangerous career of triumph;\r\nforeseeing the peril to come, he had forgotten the peril at hand; he had\r\nbelieved too much and too long in the influence of negotiations and the\r\npossibility of regaining the friendship of France.  He died unhappy, in\r\nspite of his pious submission to the will of God; what he had desired for\r\nhis country was slipping from him abroad as well as at home; Holland was\r\ncrushed by France, and the aristocratic republic was vanquished by\r\nmonarchical democracy. With the weakness characteristic of human views,\r\nhe could not open his eyes to a vision of constitutional monarchy freely\r\nchosen, preserving to his country the independence, prosperity, and order\r\nwhich he had labored to secure for her.  A politician as, bold as and\r\nmore far-sighted than Admiral Coligny, twice struck down, like him, by\r\nassassins, John van Witt remained in history the unique model of a great\r\nrepublican chief, virtuous and able, proud and modest, up to the day at\r\nwhich other United Provinces, fighting like Holland for their liberty,\r\npresented a rival to the purity of his fame, when they chose for their\r\ngovernor General Washington.\r\n\r\nFor all their brutal ingratitude, the instinct of the people of Holland\r\nsaw clearly into the situation.  John van Witt would have failed in the\r\nstruggle against France; William of Orange, prince, politician, and\r\nsoldier, saved his country and Europe from the yoke of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nOn quitting his army, the king had inscribed in his notebook, “My\r\ndeparture.--I do not mean to have anything more done.”  The temperature\r\nfavored his designs; it did not freeze, the country remained inundated\r\nand the towns unapproachable; the troops of the Elector of Brandenburg,\r\ntogether with a corps sent by the emperor, had put themselves in motion\r\ntowards the Rhine; Turenne kept them in check in Germany.  Conde covered\r\nAlsace; the Duke of Luxembourg, remaining in Holland, confined himself to\r\nburning two large villages--Bodegrave and Saammerdam.  “There was a grill\r\nof all the Hollanders who were in those burghs,” wrote the marshal to the\r\nPrince of Conde, “not one of whom was let out of the houses.  This\r\nmorning we were visited by two of the enemy’s drummers, who came to claim\r\na colonel of great note amongst them (I have him in cinders at this\r\nmoment), as well as several officers that we have not, and that are\r\ndemanded of us, who, I suppose, were killed at the approaches to the\r\nvillages, where I saw some rather pretty little heaps.”  The attempts of\r\nthe Prince of Orange on Charleroi had failed, as well as those of\r\nLuxembourg on the Hague; the Swedes had offered their mediation, and\r\nnegotiations were beginning at Cologne; on the 10th of June, 1673, Louis\r\nXIV. laid siege to Maestricht; Conde was commanding in Holland, with\r\nLuxembourg under his orders; Turenne was observing Germany.  The king was\r\nalone with Vauban.  Maestricht held out three weeks.  “M. de Vauban, in\r\nthis siege as in many others, saved a number of lives by his ingenuity,”\r\n wrote a young subaltern, the Count of Alligny.  “In times past it was\r\nsheer butchery in the trenches, now he makes them in such a manner that\r\none is as safe as if one were at home.”  “I don’t know whether it ought\r\nto be called swagger, vanity, or carelessness, the way we have of showing\r\nourselves unadvisedly and without cover,” Vauban used to say; “ but it is\r\nan original sin of which the French will never purge themselves, if God,\r\nwho is all-powerful, do not reform the whole race.”  Maestricht taken,\r\nthe king repaired to Elsass, where skilful negotiations delivered into\r\nhis hands the towns that had remained independent: it was time to\r\nconsolidate past conquests; the coalition of Europe was forming against\r\nFrance; the Hollanders held the sea against the hostile fleets; after\r\nthree desperate fights, Ruyter had prevented all landing in Holland; the\r\nStates no longer entertained the proposals they had but lately submitted\r\nto the king at Utrecht; the Prince of Orange had recovered Naarden, and\r\njust carried Bonn, with the aid of the Imperialists, commanded by\r\nMontecuculli; Luxembourg had already received orders to evacuate the\r\nprovince of Utrecht; at the end of the campaign of 1673, Gueldres and\r\nOver-Yssel were likewise delivered from the enemies who had oppressed and\r\nplundered them; Spain had come forth from her lethargy; and the emperor,\r\nresuming the political direction of Germany, had drawn nearly all the\r\nprinces after him into the league against France.  The Protestant qualms\r\nof the English Parliament had not yielded to the influence of the Marquis\r\nof Ruvigny, a man of note amongst the French Reformers, and at this time\r\nambassador of France in London; the nation desired peace with the\r\nHollanders; and Charles II. yielded, in appearance at least, to the\r\nwishes of his people.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of February, 1674, he repaired to Parliament to announce to\r\nthe two Houses that he had concluded with the United Provinces “a prompt\r\npeace, as they had prayed, honorable, and, as he hoped, durable.”  He at\r\nthe same time wrote to Louis XIV., to beg to be condoled with, rather\r\nthan upbraided, for a consent which had been wrung from him.  The\r\nregiments of English and Irish auxiliaries remained quietly in the\r\nservice of France; and the king did not withdraw his subsidies from his\r\nroyal pensioner.\r\n\r\nThus was being undone, link by link, the chain of alliances which Louis\r\nXIV. had but lately twisted round Holland.  France, in her turn, was\r\nfinding herself alone, with all Europe against her; scared, and,\r\nconsequently, active and resolute; the congress of Cologne had broken up;\r\nnot one of the belligerents desired peace; the Hollanders had just\r\nsettled the heredity of the stadtholderate in the house of Orange.  Louis\r\nXIV. saw the danger.  “So many enemies,” says he in his Memoires,\r\n“obliged me to take care of myself, and think what I must do to maintain\r\nthe reputation of my arms, the advantage of my dominions, and my personal\r\nglory.”  It was in Franche-Comte that Louis XIV. went to seek these\r\nadvantages.  The whole province was reduced to submission in the month of\r\nJune, 1674.  Turenne had kept the Rhine against the Imperialists; the\r\nmarshal alone escaped the tyranny of the king and Louvois, and presumed\r\nto conduct the campaign in his own way; when Louis XIV. sent him\r\ninstructions, he was by this time careful to add, “You will not bind\r\nyourself down to what I send you hereby as to my intentions, save when\r\nyou think that the good of my service will permit you, and you will give\r\nme of your news the oftenest you find it possible.”  (30th of March,\r\n1674.)  Turenne did not always write, and it sometimes happened that he\r\ndid not obey.\r\n\r\nThis redounded to his honor in the campaign of 1674.  Conde had gained,\r\non the 11th of August, the bloody victory of Seneffe over the Prince of\r\nOrange and the allied generals; the four squadrons of the king’s\r\nhousehold, posted within range of the fire, had remained for eight hours\r\nin order of battle, without any movement but that of closing up as the\r\nmen fell.  Madame de Sdvigne, to whom her son, standard-bearer in the\r\ndauphin’s gendarmes, had told the story, wrote to M. de BussyRabutin,\r\n“But for the Te Deum, and some flags brought to Notre-Dame, we should\r\nhave thought we had lost the battle.”  The Prince 6f Orange, ever\r\nindomitable in his cold courage, had attacked Audenarde on the 15th of\r\nSeptember; but he was not in force, and the, approach of Conde had\r\nobliged him to raise the siege; to make up, he had taken Grave, spite of\r\nthe heroic resistance made by the Marquis of Chemilly, who had held out\r\nninety-three days.  Advantages remained balanced in Flanders; the result\r\nof the campaign depended on Turenne, who commanded on the Rhine.  “If the\r\nking had taken the most important place in Flanders,” he wrote to\r\nLouvois, “and the emperor were master of Alsace, even without Philipsburg\r\nor Brisach, I think the king’s affairs would be in the worst plight in\r\nthe world; we should see what armies we should have in Lorraine, in the\r\nBishoprics, and in Champagne.  I do assure you that, if I had the honor\r\nof commanding in Flanders, I would speak as I do.”  On the 16th of June\r\nhe engaged in battle, at Sinzheim, with the Duke of Lorraine, who was\r\ncoming up with the advance-guard.  “I never saw a more obstinate fight,”\r\n said Turenne: “those old regiments of the emperor’s did mighty well.”\r\n He subsequently entered the Palatinate, quartering his troops upon it,\r\nwhilst the superintendents sent by Louvois were burning and plundering\r\nthe country, crushed as it was under war-contributions.  The king and\r\nLouvois were disquieted by the movement of the enemy’s troops, and wanted\r\nto get Turenne back into Lothringen.  “An army like that of the enemy,”\r\n wrote the marshal to Louvois, on the 13th of Septem ber, “and at the\r\nseason it is now, cannot have any idea but that of driving the king’s\r\narmy from Alsace, having neither provisions nor means of getting into\r\nLorraine, unless I be driven from the country.”  On the 20th of\r\nSeptember, the burgesses of the free city of Strasburg delivered up\r\nthe bridge over the Rhine to the Imperialists who were in the heart\r\nof Elsass.  The victory of Ensheim, the fights of Mulhausen and\r\nTurckheim, sufficed to drive them back; but it was only on the 22d\r\nof January, 1675, that Turenne was at last enabled to leave Elsass\r\nreconquered.  “There is no longer in France an enemy that is not a\r\nprisoner,” he wrote to the king, whose thanks embarrassed him.\r\n“Everybody has remarked that M. de Turenne is a little more bashful than\r\nhe was wont to be,” said Pellisson.\r\n\r\nThe coalition was proceeding slowly; the Prince of Orange was ill; the\r\nking made himself master of the citadel of Liege and some small places.\r\nLimburg surrendered to the Prince of Conde, without the allies having\r\nbeen able to relieve it; Turenne was posted with the Rhine in his rear,\r\nkeeping Montecuculli in his front; he was preparing to hem him in, and\r\nhurl him back upon Black Mountain.  His army was thirty thousand strong.\r\n“I never saw so many fine fellows,” Turenne would say, “nor better\r\nintentioned.”  Spite of his modest reserve, he felt sure of victory.\r\n“This time I have them,” he kept saying; “they cannot escape me.”\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of June, 1675, in the morning, Turenne ordered an attack on\r\nthe village of Salzbach.  The young Count of St. Hilaire found him at the\r\nhead of his infantry, seated at the foot of a tree, into which he had\r\nordered an old soldier to climb, in order to have a better view of the\r\nenemy’s manoeuvres.  The Count of Roye sent to conjure him to reconnoitre\r\nin person the German column that was advancing.  “I shall remain where I\r\nam,” said Turenne, “unless something important occur;” and he sent off\r\nre-enforcements to M. de Roye; the latter repeated his entreaties; the\r\nmarshal asked for his horse, and, at a hard gallop, reached the right of\r\nthe army, along a hollow, in order to be under cover from two small\r\npieces of cannon, which kept up an incessant fire.  “I don’t at all want\r\nto be killed to-day,” he kept saying.  He perceived M. do St. Hilaire,\r\nthe father, coming to meet him, and asked him what column it was on\r\naccount of which he had been sent for.  “My father was pointing it out to\r\nhim, writes young St.  Hilaire, “when, unhappily, the two little pieces\r\nfired: a ball, passing over the quarters of my father’s horse, carried\r\naway his left arm and the horse’s neck, and struck M. de Turenne in the\r\nleft side; he still went forward about twenty paces on his horse’s neck,\r\nand fell dead.  I ran to my father, who was down, and raised him up.\r\n‘No need to weep for me,’ he said; ‘it is the death of that great man;\r\nyou may, perhaps, lose your father, but neither your country nor you will\r\never have a general like that again.  O, poor army, what is to become of\r\nyou?’  Tears fell from his eyes; then, suddenly recovering himself, ‘Go,\r\nmy son, and leave me,’ he said; ‘with me it will be as God pleases; time\r\npresses; go and do your duty.’” [_Memoires du Marquis de St. Hilaire,_\r\nt. i.  p. 205.]  They threw a cloak over the corpse of the great general,\r\nand bore it away.  “The soldiers raised a cry that was heard two leagues\r\noff,” writes Madame de Sevigne; “no consideration could restrain them;\r\nthey roared to be led to battle, they wanted to avenge the death of their\r\nfather, with him they had feared nothing, but they would show how to\r\navenge him, let it be left to them; they were frantic, let them be led to\r\nbattle.”  Montecuculli had for a moment halted.  “Today a man has fallen\r\nwho did honor to man,” said he, as he uncovered respectfully.  He threw\r\nhimself, however, on the rearguard of the French army, which was falling\r\nback upon Elsass, and recrossed the Rhine at Altenheim.  The death of\r\nTurenne was equivalent to a defeat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Death of Turenne----443]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Napoleon said of Turenne, “He is the only general whom\r\nexperience ever made more daring.”  He had been fighting for forty years,\r\nand his fame was still increasing, without effort or ostentation on his\r\npart.  “M. de Turenne, from his youth up, possessed all good qualities,”\r\n wrote Cardinal de Retz, who knew him well, “and the great he acquired\r\nfull early.  He lacked none but those that he did not think about.  He\r\npossessed nearly all virtues as it were by nature; he never possessed the\r\nglitter of any.  He was believed to be more fitted for the head of an\r\narmy than of a party, and so I think, because he was not naturally\r\nenterprising; but, however, who knows?  He always had in everything, just\r\nas in his speech, certain obscurities, which were never cleared up save\r\nby circumstances, but never save to his glory.”  He had said, when he set\r\nout, to this same Cardinal de Retz, then in retirement at Commercy, “Sir,\r\nI am no _talker (diseur),_ but I beg you to believe that, if it were not\r\nfor this business in which perhaps I may be required, I would go into\r\nretirement as you have gone, and I give you my word that, if I come back,\r\nI, like you, will put some space between life and death.”  God did not\r\nleave him time.  He summoned suddenly to Him this noble, grand, and\r\nsimple soul.  “I see that cannon loaded with all eternity,” says Madame\r\nde Sevigne: “I see all that leads M. de Turenne thither, and I see\r\ntherein nothing gloomy for him.  What does he lack?  He dies in the\r\nmeridian of his fame.  Sometimes, by living on, the star pales.  It is\r\nsafer to cut to the quick, especially in the case of heroes whose actions\r\nare all so watched.  M. de Turenne did not feel death: count you that for\r\nnothing?”  Turenne was sixty-four; he had become a convert to Catholicism\r\nin 1668, seriously and sincerely, as he did everything.  For him Bossuet\r\nhad written his Exposition of faith.  Heroic souls are rare, and those\r\nthat are heroic and modest are rarer still: that was the distinctive\r\nfeature of M. de Turenne.  “When a man boasts that he has never made\r\nmistakes in war, he convinces me that he has not been long at it,” he\r\nwould say.  At his death, France considered herself lost.  “The premier-\r\npresident of the court of aids has an estate in Champagne, and the farmer\r\nof it came the other day to demand to have the contract dissolved; he was\r\nasked why: he answered that in M. de Turenne’s time one could gather in\r\nwith safety, and count upon the lands in that district, but that, since\r\nhis death, everybody was going away, believing that the enemy was about\r\nto enter Champagne.” [_Lettres de Madame de Sevigne_.]  “I should very\r\nmuch like to have only two hours’ talk with the shade of M. de Turenne,”\r\n said the Prince of Conde, on setting out to take command of the army of\r\nthe Rhine, after a check received by Marshal Crequi.  “I would take the\r\nconsequences of his plans if I could only get at his views, and make\r\nmyself master of the knowledge he had of the country, and of\r\nMontecuculli’s tricks of feint.”  “God preserves you for the sake of\r\nFrance, my lord,” people said to him; but the prince made no reply beyond\r\na shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURENNE.----444]\r\n\r\nIt was his last campaign.  The king had made eight marshals, “change for\r\na Turenne.”  Crequi began by getting beaten before Treves, which\r\nsurrendered to the enemy.  “Why did--the marshal give battle?” asked a\r\ncourtier.  The king turned round quickly.  “I have heard,” said he, “that\r\nthe Duke of Weimar, after the death of the great Gustavus, commanded the\r\nSwedish allies of France; one Parabere, an old blue ribbon, said to him,\r\nspeaking of the last battle, which he had lost, ‘Sir, why did you give\r\nit?’  ‘Sir,’ answered Weimar, ‘because I thought I should win it.’  Then,\r\nleaning over towards somebody else, he asked, ‘Who is that fool with the\r\nblue ribbon?’”  The Germans retired.  Conde returned to Chantilly once\r\nmore, never to go out of it again.  Montecuculli, old and ill, refused to\r\nserve any longer.  “A man who has had the honor of fighting against\r\nMahomet Coprogli, against the prince, and against M. de Turenne, ought\r\nnot to compromise his glory against people who are only just beginning to\r\ncommand armies,” said the, veteran general to the emperor on taking his\r\nretirement.  The chiefs were disappearing from the scene, the heroic\r\nperiod of the war was over.\r\n\r\nEurope demanded a general peace; England and Holland desired it\r\npassionately.  “I am as anxious as you for an end to be put to the war,”\r\n said the Prince of Orange to the deputies from the Estates, “provided\r\nthat I get out of it with honor.”  He refused obstinately to separate\r\nfrom his allies.  “It is not astonishing that the Prince of Orange does\r\nnot at once give way even to things which he considers reasonable,” said\r\nCharles II., “he is the son of a father and mother whose obstinacy was\r\ncarried to extremes; and he resembles them in that.”  Meanwhile, William\r\nhad just married (November 15, 1677), the Princess Mary, eldest daughter\r\nof the Duke of York and Anne Hyde.  An alliance offensive and defensive\r\nbetween England and Holland was the price of this union, which struck\r\nLouis XIV. an unexpected blow.  He had lately made a proposal to the\r\nPrince of Orange to marry one of his natural daughters.  “The first\r\nnotice I had of the marriage,” wrote the king, “was through the bonfires\r\nlighted in London.”  “The loss of a decisive battle could not have scared\r\nthe King of France more,” said the English ambassador, Lord Montagu.  For\r\nmore than a year past negotiations had been going on at Nimeguen; Louis\r\nXIV. resolved to deal one more great blow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Exploit of John Bart’s----446]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1676 had been insignificant, save at sea.  John Bart, a\r\ncorsair of Dunkerque, scoured the seas and made foreign commerce tremble;\r\nhe took ships by boarding, and killed with his own hands the Dutch\r\ncaptain of the Neptune, who offered resistance.  Messina, in revolt\r\nagainst the Spaniards, had given herself up to France; the Duke of\r\nVivonne, brother of Madame de Montespan, who had been sent thither as\r\ngovernor, had extended his conquests; Duquesne, quite young still, had\r\ntriumphantly maintained the glory of France against the great Ruyter, who\r\nhad been mortally wounded off Catana; on the 21st of April.  But already\r\nthe possession of Sicily was becoming precarious, and these distant\r\nsuccesses had paled before the brilliant campaign of 1677; the capture of\r\nValenciennes, Cambrai, and St.  Omer, the defence of Lorraine, the\r\nvictory of Cassel, gained over the Prince of Orange, had confirmed the\r\nking in his intentions.  “We have done all that we were able and bound to\r\ndo,” wrote William of Orange to the Estates, on the 13th of April, 1677,\r\n“and we are very sorry to be obliged to tell your High Mightinesses that\r\nit has not pleased God to bless on this occasion the arms of the state\r\nunder our guidance.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Duquesne victorious over Ruyter---446a]\r\n\r\n“I was all impatience,” says Louis XIV. in his Memoires, “to commence\r\nthe campaign of 1678, and greatly desirous of doing something therein as\r\nglorious as, and more useful than, what had already been done; but it was\r\nno easy matter to come by it, and to surpass the lustre conferred by the\r\ncapture of three large places and the winning of a battle.  I examined\r\nwhat was feasible, and Ghent being the most important of all I could\r\nattack, I fixed upon it to besiege.”  The place was invested on the 1st\r\nof March, and capitulated on the 11th; Ypres, in its turn, succumbed on\r\nthe 25th, after a vigorous resistance.  On the 7th of April the king\r\nreturned to St. Germain, “pretty content with what I had done,” he says,\r\n“and purposing to do better in the future, if the promise I had given not\r\nto undertake anything for two months were not followed by the conclusion\r\nof peace.”  Louis XIV. sent his ultimatum to Nimeguen.\r\n\r\nHolland had weight in congress as well as in war, and her influence was\r\nnow enlisted on the side of peace.  “Not only is it desired,” said the\r\ngrand pensionary Fagel, “but it is absolutely indispensable, and I would\r\nnot answer for it that the States General, if driven to extremity by the\r\nsluggishness of their allies, will not make a separate peace with France.\r\nI know nobody in Holland who is not of the same opinion.”  The Prince of\r\nOrange flew out at such language.  “Well, then, I know somebody,” said\r\nhe, “and that is myself; I will oppose it to the best of my ability;\r\nbut,” he added more slowly, upon reflection, “if I were not here, I know\r\nquite well that peace would be concluded within twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\nOne man alone, though it were the Prince of Orange, cannot long withstand\r\nthe wishes of a free people.  The republican party, for a while cast down\r\nby the death of John van Witt, had taken courage again, and Louis XIV.\r\nsecretly encouraged it.  William of Orange had let out his desire of\r\nbecoming Duke of Gueldres and Count of Zutphen: these foreshadowings of\r\nsovereignty had scared the province of Holland, which refused its\r\nconsent; the influence of the stadtholder was weakened thereby; the\r\nEstates pronounced for peace, spite of the entreaties of the Prince of\r\nOrange.  “I am always ready to obey the orders of the state,” said he,\r\n“but do not require me to give my assent to a peace which appears to me\r\nnot only ruinous, but shameful as well.”  Two deputies from the United\r\nProvinces set out for Brussels.\r\n\r\n“It is better to throw one’s self out of the window than from the top of\r\nthe roof,” said the Spanish plenipotentiary to the nuncio, when he had\r\ncognizance of the French proposals, and he accepted the treaty offered\r\nhim.  “The Duke of Villa Hermosa says that he will accept the conditions;\r\nfor ourselves, we will do the same,” said the Prince of Orange, bitterly,\r\n“and so here is peace made, if France continues to desire it on this\r\nfooting, which I very much doubt.”\r\n\r\nAt one moment, in fact, Louis XIV. raised fresh pretensions.  He wished\r\nto keep the places on the Meuse, until the Swedes, almost invariably\r\nunfortunate in their hostilities with Denmark and Brandenburg, should\r\nhave been enabled to win back what they had lost.  This was to postpone\r\npeace indefinitely.  The English Parliament and Holland were disgusted,\r\nand concluded a new alliance.  The Spaniards were preparing to take up\r\narms again.  The king, who had returned to the army, all at once cut the\r\nknot.  “The day I arrived at the camp,” writes Louis XIV., I received\r\nnews from London apprising mee that the King of England would bind\r\nhimself to join me in forcing my enemies to make peace, if I consented to\r\nadd something to the conditions he had already proposed.  I had a battle\r\nover this proposal, but the public good, joined to the glory of gaining a\r\nvictory over myself, prevailed over the advantage I might have hoped for\r\nfrom war.  I replied to the King of England that I was quite willing to\r\nmake the treaty he proposed to me, and, at the same time, I wrote to the\r\nStates General a letter, stronger than the first, being convinced that,\r\nsince they were wavering, they ought not to have time given them to take\r\ncounsel upon the subject of peace with their allies, who did not want\r\nit.”  Beverninck went to visit the king at Ghent; and he showed so much\r\nability that the special peace concluded by his pains received, in\r\nHolland, the name of Beverninck’s peace.  “I settled more business in an\r\nhour with M. de Beverninck than the plenipotentiaries would have been\r\nable to conclude in several days,” said Louis XIV.; “the care I had taken\r\nto detach the allies one from another, overwhelmed them to such an\r\nextent, that they were constrained to submit to the conditions of which I\r\nhad declared myself in favor at the commencement of my negotiations.  I\r\nhad resolved to make peace, but I wished to conclude one that would be\r\nglorious for me and advantageous for my kingdom.  I wished to recompense\r\nmyself, by means of the places that were essential, for the probable\r\nconquests I was losing, and to console myself for the conclusion of a war\r\nwhich I was carrying on with pleasure and success.  Amidst such turmoil,\r\nthen, I was quite tranquil, and saw nothing but advantage for myself,\r\nwhether the war went on or peace were made.”\r\n\r\nAll difficulties were smoothed away Sweden had given up all stipulations\r\nfor her advantage; the firm will of France had triumphed over the\r\nvacillations of Charles II.  and the allies.  “The behavior of the French\r\nin all this was admirable,” says Sir W. Temple, an experienced\r\ndiplomatist, long versed in all the affairs of Europe, “whilst our own\r\ncounsels and behavior resembled those floating islands which winds and\r\ntide drive from one side to the other.”\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of August, in the evening, the special peace between Holland\r\nand France was signed after twenty-four hours’ conference.  The Prince of\r\nOrange had concentrated all his forces near Mons, confronting Marshal\r\nLuxembourg, who occupied the plateau of Casteau; he had no official news\r\nas yet from Nimeguen, and on the 14th he began the engagement outside the\r\nabbey of St. Denis.  The affair was a very murderous one, and remained\r\nindecisive: it did more honor to the military skill of the Prince of\r\nOrange than to his loyalty.  Holland had not lost an inch of her\r\nterritory during this war; so long, so desperate, and notoriously\r\nundertaken in order to destroy her; she had spent much money, she had\r\nlost many men, she had shaken the confidence of her allies by treating\r\nalone and being the first to treat, but she had furnished a chief to the\r\nEuropean coalition, and she had shown an example of indomitable\r\nresistance; the States General and the Prince of Orange alone, besides\r\nLouis XIV., came the greater out of the struggle.  The King of England\r\nhad lost all consideration both at home and abroad, and Spain paid all\r\nthe expenses of the war.\r\n\r\nPeace was concluded on the 17th of September, thanks to the energetic\r\nintervention of the Hollanders.  The king restored Courtray, Audenarde,\r\nAth, and Charleroi, which had been given him by the treaty of Aix-la-\r\nChapelle, Ghent, Linmburg, and St.  Ghislain; but he kept by definitive\r\nright St. Omer, Cassel, Aire, Ypres, Cambray, Bouchain, Valenciennes, and\r\nall Franche-Comte; henceforth he possessed in the north of France a line\r\nof places extending from Dunkerque to the Meuse; the Spanish monarchy was\r\ndisarmed.\r\n\r\nIt still required a successful campaign under Marshal Crequi to bring the\r\nemperor and the German princes over to peace; exchanges of territory and\r\nindemnities re-established the treaty of Westphalia on all essential\r\npoints.  The Duke of Lorraine refused the conditions on which the king\r\nproposed to restore to him his duchy; so Louis XIV. kept Lorraine.\r\n\r\nThe King of France was at the pinnacle of his greatness and power.\r\n“Singly against all,” as Louvois said, he had maintained the struggle\r\nagainst Europe, and he came out of it victorious; everywhere, with good\r\nreason, was displayed his proud device, _Nec pluribus impar_.  “My will\r\nalone,” says Louis XIV. in his Memoires, “concluded this peace, so much\r\ndesired by those on whom it did not depend; for, as to my enemies, they\r\nfeared it as much as the public good made me desire it, and that\r\nprevailed on this occasion over the gain and personal glory I was likely\r\nto find in the continuation of the war.  .  .  .  I was in full enjoyment\r\nof my good fortune and the fruits of my good conduct, which had caused me\r\nto profit by all the occasions I had met with for extending the borders\r\nof my kingdom at the expense of my enemies.”\r\n\r\n“Here is peace made,” wrote Madame de Sevigne to the Count of Bussy.\r\n“The king thought it handsomer to grant it this year to Spain and Holland\r\nthan to take the rest of Flanders; he is keeping that for another time.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange thought as Madame de Seigne: he regarded the peace\r\nof Nimeguen as a truce, and a truce fraught with danger to Europe.  For\r\nthat reason did he soon seek to form alliances in order to secure the\r\nrepose of the world against the insatiable ambition of King Louis XIV.\r\nIntoxicated by his successes and the adulation of his court, the King of\r\nFrance no longer brooked any objections to his will or any limits to his\r\ndesires.  The poison of absolute power had done its work.  Louis XIV.\r\nconsidered the “office of king” grand, noble, delightful, “for he felt\r\nhimself worthy of acquitting himself well in all matters in which he\r\nengaged.”  “The ardor we feel for glory,” he used to say, “is not one of\r\nthose feeble passions which grow dull by possession; its favors, which\r\nare never to be obtained without effort, never, on the other hand, cause\r\ndisgust, and whoever can do without longing for fresh ones is unworthy of\r\nall he has received.”\r\n\r\nStanding at the king’s side and exciting his pride and ambition, Louvois\r\nhad little by little absorbed all the functions of prime minister without\r\nbearing the title.  Colbert alone resisted him, and he, weary of the\r\nstruggle, was about to succumb before long (1683), driven to desperation\r\nby the burdens that the wars and the king’s luxury caused to weigh\r\nheavily upon France.  Peace had not yet led to disarmament; an army of a\r\nhundred and forty thousand men remained standing, ever ready to uphold\r\nthe rights of France during the long discussions over the regulation of\r\nthe frontiers.  In old papers ancient titles were found, and by degrees\r\nthe villages, Burghs, and even principalities, claimed by King Louis XIV.\r\nwere re-united quietly to France; King Charles XI. was thus alienated, in\r\nconsequence of the seizure of the countship of Deux-Ponts, to which\r\nSweden laid claim.  Strasburg was taken by a surprise.  This free city\r\nhad several times violated neutrality during the war; Louvois had kept up\r\ncommunications inside the place; suddenly he had the approaches and the\r\npassage over the Rhine occupied by thirty-five thousand men on the night\r\nbetween the 16th and 17th of September, 1681; the burgesses sent up to\r\nask aid from the emperor, but the messengers were arrested; on the 30th\r\nStrasburg capitulated, and Louis XIV. made his triumphant entry there on\r\nthe 24th of October.  “Nobody,” says a letter of the day, “can recover\r\nfrom the consternation caused by the fact that the French have taken\r\nStrasburg without firing a single shot; everybody says it is one of the\r\nwheels of the chariot to be used for a drive into the empire, and that\r\nthe door of Elsass is shut from this moment.”\r\n\r\nThe very day of the surrender of Strasburg (September 30, 1681), Catinat,\r\nwith a corps of French troops, entered Casale, sold to Louis XIV. by the\r\nDuke of Mantua.  The king thought to make sure of Piedmont by marrying\r\nhis niece, Monsieur’s daughter, to the Duke of Savoy, Victor-Amadeo,\r\nquite a boy, delicate and taciturn, at loggerheads with his mother and\r\nwith her favorites.  Marie Louise d’Orleans, elder sister of the young\r\nDuchess of Savoy, had married the King of Spain, Charles II., a sickly\r\ncreature of weak intellect.  Louis XIV. felt the necessity of forming new\r\nalliances; the old supports of France had all gone over to the enemy.\r\nSweden and Holland were already allied to the empire; the German princes\r\njoined the coalition.  The Prince of Orange, with an ever-vigilant eye on\r\nthe frequent infractions of the treaties which France permitted herself\r\nto commit, was quietly negotiating with his allies, and ready to take up\r\narms to meet the common danger.  “He was,” says Massillon, “a prince\r\nprofound in his views, skilful in forming leagues and banding spirits\r\ntogether, more successful in exciting wars than on the battle-field, more\r\nto be feared in the privacy of the closet than at the head of armies, a\r\nprince and an enemy whom hatred of the French name rendered capable of\r\nconceiving great things and of executing them, one of those geniuses who\r\nseem born to move at their will both peoples and sovereigns.”  French\r\ndiplomacy was not in a condition to struggle with the Prince of Orange.\r\nM. de Pomponne had succeeded Lionne; he was disgraced in 1679.  “I order\r\nhis recall,” said the king, “because all that passes through his hands\r\nloses the grandeur and force which ought to be shown in executing the\r\norders of a king who is no poor creature.”  Colbert de Croissy, the\r\nminister’s brother, was from that time employed to manage with foreign\r\ncountries all the business which Louvois did not reserve to himself.\r\n\r\nDuquesne had bombarded Algiers in 1682; in 1684, he destroyed several\r\ndistricts of Genoa, which was accused of having failed in neutrality\r\nbetween France and Spain; and at the same time Marshals Humieres and\r\nCrequi occupied Audenarde, Courtray, and Dixmude, and made themselves\r\nmasters of Luxemburg; the king reproached Spain with its delays in the\r\nregulation of the frontiers, and claimed to occupy the Low Countries\r\npacifically; the diet of Ratisbonne intervened; the emperor, with the aid\r\nof Sobieski, King of Poland, was occupied in repelling the invasions of\r\nthe Turks; a truce was concluded for twenty-four years; the empire and\r\nSpain acquiesced in the king’s new conquests.  “It seemed to be\r\nestablished,” said the Marquis de la Fare, “that the empire of France was\r\nan evil not to be avoided by other nations.”  Nobody was more convinced\r\nof this than King Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nHe was himself about to deal his own kingdom a blow more fatal than all\r\nthose of foreign wars and of the European coalition.  Intoxicated by so\r\nmuch success and so many victories, he fancied that consciences were to\r\nbe bent like states, and he set about bringing all his subjects back to\r\nthe Catholic faith.  Himself returning to a regular life, under the\r\ninfluence of age and of Madame de Maintenon, he thought it a fine thing\r\nto establish in his kingdom that unity of religion which Henry IV. and\r\nRichelieu had not been able to bring about.  He set at nought all the\r\nrights consecrated by edicts, and the long patience of those Protestants\r\nwhom Mazarin called “the faithful flock;” in vain had persecution been\r\ntried for several years past; tyranny interfered, and the edict of Nantes\r\nwas revoked on the 13th of October, 1685.  Some years later, the\r\nReformers, by hundreds of thousands, carried into foreign lands their\r\nindustries, their wealth, and their bitter resentments.  Protestant\r\nEurope, indignant, opened her doors to these martyrs to conscience,\r\nliving witnesses of the injustice and arbitrary power of Louis XIV.\r\nAll the princes felt themselves at the same time insulted and threatened\r\nin respect of their faith as well as of their puissance.  In the early\r\nmonths of 1686, the league of Augsburg united all the German princes,\r\nHolland, and Sweden; Spain and the Duke of Savoy were not slow to join\r\nit.  In 1687, the diet of Ratisbonne refused to convert the twenty years’\r\ntruce into a definitive peace.  By his haughty pretensions the king gave\r\nto the coalition the support of Pope Innocent XI.; Louis XIV. was once\r\nmore single-handed against all, when he invaded the electorate of Cologne\r\nin the month of August, 1686.  Philipsburg, lost by France in 1676, was\r\nrecovered on the 29th of October; at the end of the campaign, the king’s\r\narmies were masters of the Palatinate.  In the month of January, 1689,\r\nwar was officially declared against Holland, the emperor, and the empire.\r\nThe commander-in-chief of the French forces was intrusted to the dauphin,\r\nthen twenty-six years of age.  “I give you an opportunity of making your\r\nmerit known,” said Louis XIV. to his son: “exhibit it to all Europe, so\r\nthat when I come to die it shall not be perceived that the king is dead.”\r\n\r\nThe dauphin was already tasting the pleasures of conquest, and the\r\ncoalition had not stirred.  They were awaiting their chief; William of\r\nOrange was fighting for them in the very act of taking possession of the\r\nkingdom of England.  Weary of the narrow-minded and cruel tyranny of\r\ntheir king, James II., disquieted at his blind zeal for the Catholic\r\nreligion, the English nation had summoned to their aid the champion of\r\nProtestantism; it was in the name of the political liberties and the\r\nreligious creed of England that the Prince of Orange set sail on the 11th\r\nof November, 1688; on the flags of his vessels was inscribed the proud\r\ndevice of his house, I will maintain; below were the words, _Pro\r\nlibertate et Protestante religione._  William landed without obstacle at\r\nTorbay, on the 15th of November; on the 4th of January, King James,\r\nabandoned by everybody, arrived in France, whither he had been preceded\r\nby his wife, Mary of Modena, and the little Prince of Wales; the\r\nconvention of the two Houses in England proclaimed William and Mary\r\n_kings_ (rois--?  king and queen); the Prince of Orange had declined the\r\nmodest part of mere husband of the queen.  “I will never be tied to a\r\nwoman’s apron-strings,” he had said.\r\n\r\nBy his personal qualities as well as by the defects and errors of his\r\nmind Louis XIV. was a predestined acquisition to the cause of James II.;\r\nhe regarded the revolution in England as an insolent attack by the people\r\nupon the kingly majesty, and William of Orange was the most dangerous\r\nenemy of the crown of France.  The king gave the fallen monarch a\r\nmagnificent reception.  “The king acts towards these majesties of England\r\nquite divinely,” writes Madame de Sevigne, on the 10th of January, 1689:\r\n“for is it not to be the image of the Almighty to support a king\r\nout-driven, betrayed, abandoned as he is?  The king’s noble soul is\r\ndelighted to play such a part as this.  He went to meet the Queen of\r\nEngland with all his household and a hundred six-horse carriages; he\r\nescorted her to St. Germain, where she found herself supplied, like the\r\nqueen, with all sorts of knick-knacks, amongst which was a very rich\r\ncasket with six thousand louis d’or.  The next day the King of England\r\narrived late at St. Germain; the king was there waiting for him, and went\r\nto the end of the Guards’ hall to meet him; the King of England bent down\r\nvery low, as if he meant to embrace his knees; the king prevented him,\r\nand embraced him three or four times over, very cordially.  At parting,\r\nhis Majesty would not be escorted back, but said to the King of England,\r\n‘This is your house; when I come hither you shall do me the honors of it,\r\nas I will do you when you come to Versailles.’  The king subsequently\r\nsent the King of England ten thousand louis.  The latter looked aged and\r\nworn, the queen thin and with eyes that have wept, but beautiful black\r\nones; a fine complexion, rather pale, a large mouth, fine teeth, a fine\r\nfigure and plenty of wits; all that makes up a very pleasing person.  All\r\nshe says is quite just and full of good sense.  Her husband is not the\r\nsame; he has plenty of spirit, but a common mind which relates all that\r\nhas passed in England with a want of feeling which causes the same\r\ntowards him.  It is so extraordinary to have this court here that it is\r\nthe subject of conversation incessantly.  Attempts are being made to\r\nregulate ranks and prepare for permanently living with people so far from\r\ntheir restoration.”\r\n\r\nIn his pride and his kingly illusions, Louis XIV. had undertaken a burden\r\nwhich was to weigh heavily upon him to the very end of his reign.\r\n\r\nCatholic Ireland had not acquiesced in the elevation of William of Orange\r\nto the throne of England; she invited over King James.  Personally brave,\r\nand blinded by his hopes, he set out from St. Germain on the 25th of\r\nFebruary, 1689.  “Brother,” said the king to him on taking leave, “the\r\nbest I can wish you is not to see you back.”  He took with him a corps of\r\nFrench troops commanded by M. de Rosen, and the Count of Avaux as\r\nadviser.  “It will be no easy matter to keep any secret with the King of\r\nEngland,” wrote Avaux to Louis XIV.; “he has said before the sailors of\r\nthe St. Michael what he ought to have reserved for his greatest\r\nconfidants.  Another thing which may cause us trouble is his indecision,\r\nfor he has frequent changes of opinion, and does not always determine\r\nupon the best.  He lays great stress on little things, over which he\r\nspends all his time, and passes lightly by the most essential.  Besides,\r\nhe listens to everybody, and as much time has to be spent in destroying\r\nthe impressions which bad advice has produced upon him as in inspiring\r\nhim with good.  It is said here that the Protestants of the north will\r\nintrench themselves in Londonderry, which is a pretty strong town for\r\nIreland, and that it is a business which will probably last some days.”\r\n\r\nThe siege of Londonderry lasted a hundred and five days; most of the\r\nFrench officers fell there; the place had to be abandoned; the English\r\narmy had just landed at Carrickfergus (August 25), under the orders of\r\nMarshal Schomberg.  Like their leader, a portion of Schomberg’s men were\r\nFrench Protestants who had left their native country after the revocation\r\nof the edict of Nantes; they fought to the bitter end against the French\r\nregiments of Rosen.  The Irish Parliament was beginning to have doubts\r\nabout James II.  “Too English,” it was said, “to render full justice to\r\nIreland.”  There was disorder everywhere, in the government as well as in\r\nthe military operations; Schomberg held the Irish and French in check; at\r\nlast William III. appeared.\r\n\r\nHe landed on the 14th of June, and at once took the road to Belfast; the\r\nProtestant opposition was cantoned in the province of Ulster, peopled to\r\na great extent by Cromwell’s Scotch colonists; three parts of Ireland\r\nwere still in the hands of the Catholics and King James.  “I haven’t come\r\nhither to let the grass grow under my feet,” said William to those who\r\ncounselled prudence.  He had brought with him his old Dutch and German\r\nregiments, and numbered under his orders thirty-five thousand men;\r\nrepresentatives from all the Protestant churches of Europe were there\r\nin arms against the enemies of their liberties.\r\n\r\nThe forces of King James were scarcely inferior to those of his\r\nson-in-law; Louis XIV. had sent him a re-enforcement of eight thousand\r\nmen under the orders of the Duke of Lauzun.  On the 1st of July the two\r\narmies met on the banks of the Boyne, near the town of Drogheda.\r\nWilliam had been slightly wounded in the shoulder the evening before\r\nduring a reconnaissance.  “There’s no harm done,” said he at once to his\r\nterrified friends, “but, as it was, the ball struck quite high enough.”\r\n He was on horseback at the head of his troops; at daybreak the whole\r\narmy plunged into the river; Marshal Schomberg commanded a division; he\r\nsaw that the Huguenot regiments were staggered by the death of their\r\nleader, M. de Caillemotte, younger brother of the Marquis of Ruvigny.\r\nHe rushed his horse into the river, shouting, “Forward, gentlemen;\r\nyonder are your persecutors.”  He was killed, in his turn, as he touched\r\nthe bank.  King William himself had just entered the Boyne; his horse\r\nhad taken to swimming, and he had difficulty in guiding it with his\r\nwounded arm; a ball struck his boot, another came and hit against the\r\nbutt of his pistol; the Irish infantry, ignorant and undisciplined,\r\neverywhere took flight.  “We were not beaten,” said a letter to Louvois\r\nfrom M. de la Hoguette, a French officer, “but the enemy drove the Irish\r\ntroops, like sheep, before them, without their having attempted to fire\r\na single musket-shot.”  All the burden of the contest fell upon the\r\ntroops of Louis XIV. and upon the Irish gentlemen, who fought furiously;\r\nWilliam rallied around him the Protestants of Enniskillen, and led them\r\nback to the charge; the Irish gave way on all sides; King James had\r\nprudently remained at a distance, watching the battle from afar; he\r\nturned bridle, and hastily took the road back to Dublin.  On the 3d of\r\nJuly he embarked at Waterford, himself carrying to St. Germain the news\r\nof his defeat. “Those who love the King of England must be very glad to\r\nsee him in safety,” wrote Marshal Luxembourg to Louvois; “but those who\r\nlove his glory have good reason to deplore the figure he made.”  “I was\r\nin trouble to know what had become of the king my father,” wrote Queen\r\nMary to William III.; “I dared not ask anybody but Lord Nottingham, and\r\nI had the satisfaction of learning that he was safe and sound.  I know\r\nthat I need not beg you to spare him, but to your tenderness add this,\r\nthat for my sake the world may know that you would not have any harm\r\nhappen to him. You will forgive me this.”  The rumor had spread at Paris\r\nthat King William was dead; the populace lighted bonfires in the\r\nstreets; and the governor of the Bastille fired a salute.  The anger and\r\nhatred of a people are perspicacious.\r\n\r\nThe insensate pride of king and nation was to be put to other trials; the\r\ncampaign of 1689 had been without advantage or honor to the king’s arms.\r\nDisembarrassed of the great Conde, of Turenne, and even of Marshal\r\nLuxembourg, who was compromised in some distressing law proceedings,\r\nLouvois exercised undisputed command over generals and armies; his harsh\r\nand violent genius encountered no more obstacles.  He had planned a\r\ndefensive war which was to tire out the allies, all the while ravaging\r\ntheir territories.  The Palatinate underwent all its horrors.  Manheim,\r\nHeidelberg, Spires, Worms, Bingen, were destroyed and burned.  “I don’t\r\nthink,” wrote the Count of Tesse to Louvois, “that for a week past my\r\nheart has been in its usual place.  I take the liberty of speaking to you\r\nnaturally, but I did not foresee that it would cost so much to personally\r\nlook to the burning of a town with a population, in proportion, like that\r\nof Orleans.  You may rely upon it that nothing at all remains of the\r\nsuperb castle of Heidelberg.  There were yesterday at noon, besides the\r\ncastle, four hundred and thirty-two houses burned; and the fire was still\r\ngoing on.  I merely caused to be set apart the family pictures of the\r\nPalatine House; that is, the fathers, mothers, grandmothers, and\r\nrelatives of Madame; intending, if you order me or advise me so, to make\r\nher a present of them, and have them sent to her when she is somewhat\r\ndistracted from the desolation of her native country; for, except\r\nherself, who can take any interest in them?  Of the whole lot there is\r\nnot a single copy worth a dozen livres.”  The poor Princess Palatine,\r\nMonsieur’s second wife, was not yet distracted from her native country,\r\nand she wrote in March, 1689, “Should it cost me my life, it is\r\nimpossible for me not to regret, not to deplore, having been, so to\r\nspeak, the pretext for the destruction of my country.  I cannot look on\r\nin cold blood and see the ruin at a single blow, in poor Manheim, of all\r\nthat cost so much pains and trouble to the late prince-elector, my\r\nfather.  When I think of all the explosions that have taken place, I am\r\nso full of horror that every night, the moment I begin to go to sleep, I\r\nfancy myself at Heidelberg or Manheim, and an eye-witness of the ravages\r\ncommitted.  I picture to myself how it all was in my time, and to what\r\ncondition it has been reduced now, and I cannot refrain from weeping hot\r\ntears.  What distresses me above all is, that the king waited to reveal\r\nhis orders until the very moment of my intercession in favor of\r\nHeidelberg and Manheim.  And yet it is thought bad taste for me to be\r\nafflicted!”\r\n\r\nThe Elector of Bavaria, an able prince and a good soldier, had roused\r\nGermany to avenge his wrongs; France had just been placed under the ban\r\nof the empire; and the grand alliance was forming.  All the German\r\nprinces joined it; the United Provinces, England, and Spain combined for\r\nthe restoration of the treaties of Westphalia and of the Pyrenees.\r\nEurope had mistaken hopes of forcing Louis XIV. to give up all his\r\nconquests.  Twenty years of wars and reverses were not to suffice for\r\nthat.  Fortune, however, was tiring of being favorable to France;\r\nMarshals Duras and Humieres were unable to hamper the movements of the\r\nDuke of Lorraine, Charles V., and of the Elector of Bavaria; the French\r\ngarrisons of Mayence and of Bonn were obliged to capitulate after an\r\nheroic defence their munitions failed.  The king recalled Marshal\r\nLuxembourg to the head of his armies.  The able courtier had managed to\r\nget reconciled with Louvois.  “You know, sir,” he wrote to him on the 9th\r\nof May, 1690, “with what pleasure I shall seek after such things as will\r\npossibly find favor with the king and give you satisfaction.  I am too\r\nwell aware how far my small authority extends to suppose that I can\r\nwithdraw any man from any place without having written to you previously.\r\nIt is with some repugnance that I resolve to put before you what comes\r\ninto my head, knowing well that all that is good can come only from you,\r\nand looking upon anything I conceive as merely simple ideas produced by\r\nthe indolence in which we are living here.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marshal Luxembourg---461]\r\n\r\nThe wary indolence and the observations of Luxembourg were not long in\r\ngiving place to activity.  The marshal crossed the Sambre on the 29th of\r\nJune, entered Charleroi and Namur, and on the 2d of July attacked the\r\nPrince of Waldeck near the rivulet of Fleurus.  A considerable body of\r\ntroops had made a forced march of seven leagues during the night, and\r\ncame up to take the enemy in the rear; it was a complete success, but\r\ndevoid of result, like the victory of Stafarde, gained by Catinat over\r\nthe Duke of Savoy, Victor-Amadeo, who had openly joined the coalition.\r\nThe triumphant naval battle delivered by Tourville to the English and\r\nDutch fleets off Beachy Head was a great humiliation for the maritime\r\npowers.  “I cannot express to you,” wrote William III. to the grand\r\npensionary Heinsius, holding in his absence the government of the United\r\nProvinces, “how distressed I am at the disasters of the fleet; I am so\r\nmuch the more deeply affected as I have been informed that my ships did\r\nnot properly support those of the Estates, and left them in the lurch.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Heinsius----461]\r\n\r\nWilliam had said, when he left Holland, “The republic must lead off the\r\ndance.”  The moment had come when England was going to take her part in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the month of January, 1691, William III. arrived in Holland.  “I am\r\nlanguishing for that moment,” he wrote six months before to Heinsius.\r\nAll the allies had sent their ambassadors thither.  “It is no longer the\r\ntime for deliberation, but for action,” said the King of England to the\r\ncongress “the King of France has made himself master of all the\r\nfortresses which bordered on his kingdom; if he be not opposed, he will\r\ntake all the rest.  The interest of each is bound up in the general\r\ninterest of all.  It is with the sword that we must wrest from his grasp\r\nthe liberties of Europe, which he aims at stifling, or we must submit\r\nforever to the yoke of servitude.  As for me, I will spare for that\r\npurpose neither my influence, nor my forces, nor my person, and in the\r\nspring I will come, at the head of my troops, to conquer or die with my\r\nallies.”\r\n\r\nThe spring had not yet come, and already (March 15) Mons was invested by\r\nthe French army.  The secret had been carefully kept.  On the 21st, the\r\nking arrived in person with the dauphin; William of Orange collected his\r\ntroops in all haste, but he did not come up in time: Mons capitulated on\r\nthe 8th of April; five days later, Nice, besieged by Catinat, surrendered\r\nlike Mons; Louis XIV. returned to Versailles, according to his custom\r\nafter a brilliant stroke.  Louvois was pushing on the war furiously; the\r\nnaturally fierce temper of the minister was soured by excess of work and\r\nby his decline in the king’s favor; he felt his position towards the king\r\nshaken by the influence of Madame de Maintenon; venting his wrath on the\r\nenemy, he was giving orders everywhere for conflagration and bombardment,\r\nwhen on the 17th of July, 1691, after working with the king, Louvois\r\ncomplained of pain; Louis XIV. sent him to his rooms; on reaching his\r\nchamber he fell down fainting; the people ran to fetch his third son, M.\r\nde Barbezieux; Madame do Louvois was not at Versailles, and his two elder\r\nsons were in the field; he arrived too late; his father was dead.\r\n\r\n“So he is dead, this great minister, this man of such importance, whose\r\negotism (_le moi_), as M. Nicole says, was so extensive, who was the\r\ncentre of so many things!  What business, what designs, what projects,\r\nwhat secrets, what interests to unfold, what wars begun, what intrigues,\r\nwhat beautiful moves-in-check to make and to superintend!  Ah! my God,\r\ngrant me a little while; I would fain give check to the Duke of Savoy and\r\nmate to the Prince of Orange!  No, no, thou shalt not have one, one\r\nsingle moment!”  Thus wrote Madame do Sevigne to her daughter Madame de\r\nGrignan.  Louis XIV., in whose service Louvois had spent his life, was\r\nless troubled at his death.  “Tell the King of England that I have lost a\r\ngood minister,” was the answer he sent to the complimentary condolence of\r\nKing James, “but that his affairs and mine will go on none the worse.”\r\n\r\nIn his secret heart, and beneath the veil of his majestic observance of\r\nthe proprieties, the king thought that his business, as well as the\r\nagreeableness of his life, would probably gain from being no longer\r\nsubject to the tempers and the roughnesses of Louvois.  The Grand\r\nMonarque considered that he had trained (_instruit_) his minister, but he\r\nfelt that the pupil had got away from him.  He appointed Barbezieux\r\nsecretary for war.  “I will form you,” said he.  No human hand had formed\r\nLouvois, not even that of his father, the able and prudent Michael le\r\nTellier; he had received straight from God the strong qualities,\r\nresolution, indomitable will, ardor for work, the instinct of\r\norganization and command, which had made of him a minister without equal\r\nfor the warlike and ambitious purposes of his master.  Power had spoiled\r\nhim, his faults had prevailed over his other qualities without destroying\r\nthem; violent, fierce, without principle and without scruple in the\r\nexecution of his designs, he had egged the king on to incessant wars,\r\ntreating with disdain the internal miseries of the kingdom as well as any\r\nidea of pity for the vanquished; he had desired to do everything, order\r\neverything, grasp everything, and he died at fifty-three, dreaded by all,\r\nhated by a great many, and leaving in the government of the country a\r\nvoid which the king felt, all the time that he was angrily seeking to\r\nfill it up.\r\n\r\nLouvois was no more; negotiations were beginning to be whispered about,\r\nbut the war continued by land and sea; the campaign of 1691 had\r\ncompletely destroyed the hopes of James II. in Ireland; it was decided to\r\nattempt a descent upon England; a plot was being hatched to support the\r\ninvasion.  Tourville was commissioned to cover the landing.  He received\r\norders to fight, whatever might be the numbers of the enemy.  The wind\r\nprevented his departure from Brest; the Dutch fleet had found time to\r\njoin the English.  Tourville wanted to wait for the squadrons of Estrees\r\nand Rochefort; Pontchartrain had been minister of finance and marine\r\nsince the death of Seignelay, Colbert’s son, in 1690; he replied from\r\nVersailles to the experienced sailor, familiar with battle from the age\r\nof fourteen, “It is not for you to discuss the king’s orders; it is for\r\nyou to execute them and enter the Channel; if you are not ready to do it,\r\nthe king will put in your place somebody more obedient and less discreet\r\nthan you.”  Tourville went out and encountered the enemy’s squadrons\r\nbetween the headlands of La Hogue and Barfleur; he had forty-four vessels\r\nagainst ninety-nine, the number of English and Dutch together.  Tourville\r\nassembled his council of war, and all the officers were for withdrawing;\r\nbut the king’s orders were peremptory, and the admiral joined battle.\r\nAfter three days’ desperate resistance, backed up by the most skilful\r\nmanoeuvres, Tourville was obliged to withdraw beneath the forts of La\r\nHogue in hopes of running his ships ashore; but in this King James and\r\nMarshal Bellefonds opposed him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battle of St. Vincent  465a]\r\n\r\nTourville remained at sea, and lost a dozen vessels.  The consternation\r\nin France was profound; the nation had grown accustomed to victory; on\r\nthe 20th of June the capture of Namur raised their hopes again; this time\r\nagain William III. had been unable to succor his allies; he determined\r\nto--revenge himself on Luxembourg, whom he surprised on the 31st of\r\nAugust, between Enghaep and Steinkirk; the ground was narrow and uneven,\r\nand the King of England counted upon thus paralyzing the brilliant French\r\ncavalry.  M. de Luxembourg, ill of fever as he was, would fain have\r\ndismounted to lead to the charge the brigades of the French guards and of\r\nthe Swiss, but he was prevented; the Duke of Bourbon, the Prince of\r\nConti, the Duke of Chartres, and the Duke of Vendome, placed themselves\r\nat the head of the infantry, and, sword in hand, led it against the\r\nenemy; a fortunate movement on the part of Marshal Boufflers resulted in\r\nrendering the victory decisive.  Next year at Neerwinden (29th of July,\r\n1693) the success of the day was likewise due to the infantry.  On that\r\nday the French guards had exhausted their ammunition; putting the bayonet\r\nat the end of their pieces they broke the enemy’s battalions; this was\r\nthe first charge of the kind in the French armies.  The king’s household\r\ntroops had remained motionless for four hours under the fire of the\r\nallies: William III. thought for a moment that his gunners made bad\r\npractice; he ran up to the batteries; the French squadrons did not move\r\nexcept to close up the ranks as the files were carried off; the King of\r\nEngland could not help an exclamation of anger and admiration.  “Insolent\r\nnation!” he cried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Battle of Neerwinden----465]\r\n\r\nThe victory of Neerwinden ended in nothing but the capture of Charleroi;\r\nthe successes of Catinat at Marsaglia, in Piedmont, had washed out the\r\nshame of the Duke of Savoy’s incursion into Dauphiny in 1692.  Tourville\r\nhad remained with the advantage in several maritime engagements off Cape\r\nSt. Vincent, and burned the English vessels in the very roads of Cadiz.\r\nOn every sea the corsairs of St. Malo and Dunkerque, John Bart and\r\nDuguay-Trouin, now enrolled in the king’s navy, towed at their sterns\r\nnumerous prizes; the king and France, for a long time carried away by a\r\ncommon passion, had arrived at that point at which victories no longer\r\nsuffice in the place of solid and definitive success.  The nation was at\r\nlast tiring of its glory.  “People were dying of want to the sound of the\r\nTe Deum,” says Voltaire in the Siecle de Louis XIV.; everywhere there was\r\nweariness equal to the suffering.  Madame de Maintenon and some of her\r\nfriends at that time, sincerely devoted to the public good, rather\r\nChristians than warriors, Fenelon, the Dukes of Beauvilliers and\r\nChevreuse, were laboring to bring, the king over to pacific views; he saw\r\ngenerals as well as ministers falling one after another; Marshal\r\nLuxembourg, exhausted by the fatigues of war and the pleasures of the\r\ncourt, died on the 4th of January, 1695, at sixty-seven years of age.  An\r\nable general, a worthy pupil of the great  Conde, a courtier of much wits\r\nand no shame, he was more corrupt than his age, and his private life was\r\ninjurious to his fame; he died, however, as people did die in his time,\r\nturning to God at the last day.  “I haven’t lived like M. de Luxembourg,”\r\n said Bourdaloue, “but I should like to die like him.”  History has\r\nforgotten Marshal Luxembourg’s death and remembered his life.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. had lost  Conde and Turenne, Luxembourg, Colbert, Louvois, and\r\nSeignelay; with the exception of Vauban, he had exhausted the first rank;\r\nCatinat alone remained in the second; the king was about to be reduced to\r\nthe third: sad fruits of a long reign, of an incessant and devouring\r\nactivity, which had speedily used up men and was beginning to tire out\r\nfortune; grievous result of mistakes long hidden by glory, but glaring\r\nout at last before the eyes most blinded by prejudice!  “The whole of\r\nFrance is no longer anything but one vast hospital,” wrote Fenelon to the\r\nking under the veil of the anonymous.  “The people who so loved you are\r\nbeginning to lose affection, confidence, and even respect; the allies\r\nprefer carrying on war with loss to concluding a peace which would not be\r\nobserved.  Even those who have not dared to declare openly against you\r\nare nevertheless impatiently desiring your enfeeblement and your\r\nhumiliation as the only resource for liberty and for the repose of all\r\nChristian nations.  Everybody knows it, and none dares tell you so.\r\nWhilst you in some fierce conflict are taking the battle-field and the\r\ncannon of the enemy, whilst you are storming strong places, you do not\r\nreflect that you are fighting on ground which is sinking beneath your\r\nfeet, and that you are about to have a fall in spite of your victories.\r\nIt is time to humble yourself beneath the mighty hand of God; you must\r\nask peace, and by that shame expiate all the glory of which you have made\r\nyour idol; finally you must give up, the soonest possible, to your\r\nenemies, in order to save the state, conquests that you cannot retain\r\nwithout injustice.  For a long time past God has had His arm raised over\r\nyou; but He is slow to smite you because He has pity upon a prince who\r\nhas all his life been beset by flatterers.”  Noble and strong language,\r\nthe cruel truth of which the king did not as yet comprehend, misled as he\r\nwas by his pride, by the splendor of his successes, and by the concert of\r\npraises which his people as well as his court had so long made to\r\nreverberate in his ears.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. had led France on to the brink of a precipice, and he had in\r\nhis turn been led on by her; king and people had given themselves up\r\nunreservedly to the passion for glory and to the intoxication of success;\r\nthe day of awakening was at hand.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. was not so blind as Fenelon supposed; he saw the danger at the\r\nvery moment when his kingly pride refused to admit it.  The King of\r\nEngland had just retaken Namur, without Villeroi, who had succeeded\r\nMarshal Luxembourg, having been able to relieve the place.  Louis XIV.\r\nhad already let out that he “should not pretend to avail himself of any\r\nspecial conventions until the Prince of Orange was satisfied as regarded\r\nhis person and the crown of England.”  This was a great step towards that\r\nhumiliation recommended by Fenelon.\r\n\r\nThe secret negotiations with the Duke of Savoy were not less significant.\r\nAfter William III., Victor-Amadeo was the most active and most devoted as\r\nwell as the most able and most stubborn of the allied princes.  In the\r\nmonth of June, 1696, the treaty was officially declared.  Victor-Amadeo\r\nwould recover Savoy, Suza, the countship of Nice and Pignerol dismantled;\r\nhis eldest daughter, Princess Mary Adelaide, was to marry the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, eldest son of the dauphin, and the ambassadors of Piedmont\r\nhenceforth took rank with those of crowned heads.  In return for so many\r\nconcessions, Victor-Amadeo guaranteed to the king the neutrality of\r\nItaly, and promised to close the entry of his dominions against the\r\nProtestants of Dauphiny who came thither for refuge.  If Italy refused\r\nher neutrality, the Duke of Savoy was to unite his forces to those of the\r\nking and command the combined army.\r\n\r\nVictory would not have been more advantageous for Victor-Amadeo than his\r\nconstant defeats were; but, by detaching him from the coalition, Louis\r\nXIV. had struck a fatal blow at the great alliance: the campaign of 1696\r\nin Germany and in Flanders had resolved itself into mere observations and\r\ninsignificant engagements; Holland and England were exhausted, and their\r\ncommerce was ruined; in vain did Parliament vote fresh and enormous\r\nsupplies.  “I should want ready money,” wrote William III. to Heinsius,\r\n“and my poverty is really incredible.”\r\n\r\nThere was no less cruel want in France.  “I calculate that in these\r\nlatter days more than a tenth part of the people,” said Vauban, “are\r\nreduced to beggary, and in fact beg.”  Sweden had for a long time been\r\nproffering mediation: conferences began on the 9th of May, 1697, at\r\nNieuburg, a castle belonging to William III., near the village of\r\nRyswick.  These great halls opened one into another; the French and the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the coalition of princes occupied the two wings, the\r\nmediators sat in the centre.  Before arriving at Ryswick, the most\r\nimportant points of the treaty between France and William III. were\r\nalready settled.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. had at last consented to recognize the king that England had\r\nadopted; William demanded the expulsion of James II. from France; Louis\r\nXIV. formally refused his consent.  “I will engage not to support the\r\nenemies of King William directly or indirectly,” said he: “it would not\r\ncomport with my honor to have the name of King James mentioned in the\r\ntreaty.”  William contented himself with the concession, and merely\r\ndesired that it should be reciprocal.  “All Europe has sufficient\r\nconfidence in the obedience and submission of my people,” said Louis\r\nXIV., “and, when it is my pleasure to prevent my subjects from assisting\r\nthe King of England, there are no grounds for fearing lest he should find\r\nany assistance in my kingdom.  There can be no occasion for reciprocity;\r\nI have neither sedition nor faction to fear.”  Language too haughty for a\r\nking who had passed his infancy in the midst of the troubles of the\r\nFronde, but language explained by the patience and fidelity of the nation\r\ntowards the sovereign who had so long lavished upon it the intoxicating\r\npleasures of success.\r\n\r\nFrance offered restitution of Strasburg, Luxembourg, Mons, Charleroi, and\r\nDinant, restoration of the house of Lorraine, with the conditions\r\nproposed at Nimeguen, and recognition of the King of England.  “We have\r\nno equivalent to claim,” said the French plenipotentiaries haughtily;\r\n“your masters have never taken anything from ours.”\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of July a preliminary deed was signed between Marshal\r\nBoufflers and Bentinck, Earl of Portland, the intimate friend of King\r\nWilliam; the latter left the army and retired to his castle of Loo; there\r\nit was that he heard of the capture of Barcelona by the Duke of Vendime;\r\nSpain, which had hitherto refused to take part in the negotiations, lost\r\nall courage, and loudly demanded peace; but France withdrew her\r\nconcessions on the subject of Strasburg, and proposed to give as\r\nequivalent Friburg in Brisgau and Brisach.  William III. did not\r\nhesitate.  Heinsius signed the peace in the name of the States General\r\non the 20th of September at midnight; the English and Spanish\r\nplenipotentiaries did the same; the emperor and the empire were alone in\r\nstill holding out: the Emperor Leopold made pretensions to regulate in\r\nadvance the Spanish succession, and the Protestant princes refused to\r\naccept the maintenance of the Catholic worship in all the places in which\r\nLouis XIV. had restored it.\r\n\r\nHere again the will of William III. prevailed over the irresolution of\r\nhis allies.  “The Prince of Orange is sole arbiter of Europe,” Pope\r\nInnocent XII. had said to Lord Perth, who had a commission to him from\r\nJames II; “peoples and kings are his slaves; they will do nothing which\r\nmight displease him.”\r\n\r\n“I ask,” said William, “where anybody can see a probability of making\r\nFrance give up a succession for which she would maintain, at need, a\r\ntwenty years’ war; and God knows if we are in a position to dictate laws\r\nto France.”  The emperor yielded, despite the ill humor of the Protestant\r\nprinces.  For the ease of their consciences they joined England and\r\nHolland in making a move on behalf of the French Reformers.  Louis XIV.\r\nrefused to discuss the matter, saying, “It is my business, which concerns\r\nnone but me.”  Up to this day the refugees had preserved some hope,\r\nhenceforth their country was lost to them; many got themselves\r\nnaturalized in the countries which had given them asylum.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of 1789 alone was to re-open to their children the gates\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since Cardinal Richelieu, France moved back her\r\nfrontiers by the signature of a treaty.  She had gained the important\r\nplace of Strasburg, but she lost nearly all she had won by the treaty of\r\nNimeguen in the Low Countries and in Germany; she kept Franche-Comte, but\r\nshe gave up Lothringen.  Louis XIV. had wanted to aggrandize himself at\r\nany price and at any risk; he was now obliged to precipitately break up\r\nthe grand alliance, for King Charles II. was slowly dying at Madrid, and\r\nthe Spanish Succession was about to open.  Ignorant of the supreme evils\r\nand sorrows which awaited him on this fatal path, the King of France\r\nbegan to forget, in this distant prospect of fresh aggrandizement and\r\nwar, the checks that his glory and his policy had just met with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.----LOUIS XIV., HIS WARS AND HIS REVERSES. (1697-1713.)\r\n\r\nFrance was breathing again after nine years of a desperate war, but she\r\nwas breathing uneasily, and as it were in expectation of fresh efforts.\r\nEverywhere the memorials of the superintendents repeated the same\r\ncomplaints.  “War, the mortality of 1693, the, constant quarterings and\r\nmovements of soldiery, military service, the heavy dues, and the\r\nwithdrawal of the Huguenots have ruined the country.”  “The people,” said\r\nthe superintendent of Rouen, “are reduced to a state of want which moves\r\ncompassion.  Out of seven hundred and fifty thousand souls of which the\r\npublic is composed, if this number remain, it may be taken for certain\r\nthat there are not fifty thousand who have bread to eat when they want\r\nit, and anything to lie upon but straw.”  Agriculture suffered for lack\r\nof money and hands; commerce was ruined; the manufactures established by\r\nColbert no longer existed; the population had diminished more than a\r\nquarter since the palmy days of the king’s reign; Pontchartrain,\r\nsecretary of finance, was reduced to all sorts of expedients for raising\r\nmoney; he was anxious to rid himself of this heavy burden, and became\r\nchancellor in 1699; the king took for his substitute Chamillard, already\r\ncomptroller of finance, honest and hard-working, incapable and docile;\r\nLouis XIV. counted upon the inexhaustible resources of France, and closed\r\nhis ears to the grievances of the financiers.  “What is not spoken of is\r\nsupposed to be put an end to,” said Madame de Maintenon.  The camp at\r\nCompiegne, in 1698, surpassed in splendor all that had till then been\r\nseen; the enemies of Louis XIV. in Europe called him “the king of\r\nreviews.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the King of Spain, Charles II., dying as he was, was regularly\r\nbesieged at Madrid by the queen, his second wife, Mary Anne of Neuburg,\r\nsister of the empress, as well as by his minister, Cardinal\r\nPorto-Carrero.  The competitors for the succession were numerous; the\r\nKing of France and the emperor claimed their rights in the name of their\r\nmothers and wives, daughters of Philip III. and Philip IV.; the Elector\r\nof Bavaria put up the claims of his son by right of his mother, Mary\r\nAntoinette of Austria, daughter of the emperor; for a short time Charles\r\nII. had adopted this young prince; the child died suddenly at Madrid in\r\n1699.  For a long time past King Louis XIV.  had been secretly\r\nnegotiating for the partition of the King of Spain’s dominions, not--with\r\nthe emperor, who still hoped to obtain from Charles II. a will in favor\r\nof his second son, the Archduke Charles, but with England and Holland,\r\ndeeply interested as they were in maintaining the equilibrium between the\r\ntwo kingly houses which divided Europe.  William III. considered himself\r\ncertain to obtain the acceptance by the emperor of the conditions\r\nsubscribed by his allies.  On the 13th and 15th of May, 1700, after long\r\nhesitation and a stubborn resistance on the part of the city of\r\nAmsterdam, the treaty of partition was signed in London and at the Hague.\r\n“King William is honorable in all this business,” said a letter to the\r\nking from his ambassador, Count de Tallard; “his conduct is sincere; he\r\nis proud--none can be more so than he; but he has a modest manner, though\r\nnone can be more jealous in all that concerns his rank.”\r\n\r\nThe treaty of partition secured to the dauphin all the possessions of\r\nSpain in Italy, save Milaness, which was to indemnify the Duke of\r\nLorraine, whose duchy passed to France; Spain, the Indies, and the Low\r\nCountries were to belong to Archduke Charles.  Great was the wrath at\r\nVienna when it was known that the treaty was signed.  “Happily,” said the\r\nminister, Von Kaunitz, to the Marquis of Villars, ambassador of France,\r\n“there is One on high who will work for us in these partitions.”  “That\r\nOne,” replied M. de Villars, “will approve of their justice.”  “It is\r\nsomething new, however, for the King of England and for Holland to\r\npartition the monarchy of Spain,” continued the count.  “Allow me,”\r\n replied M. de Villars, “to excuse them in your eyes; those two powers\r\nhave quite recently come out of a war which cost them a great deal, and\r\nthe emperor nothing; for, in fact, you have been at no expense but\r\nagainst the Turks.  You had some troops in Italy, and in the empire two\r\nregiments only of hussars which were not on its pay-list; England and\r\nHolland alone bore all the burden.”  William III. was still negotiating\r\nwith the emperor and the German princes to make them accept the treaty of\r\npartition, when it all at once became known in Europe that Charles II.\r\nhad breathed his last at Madrid on the 1st of November, 1700, and that,\r\nby a will dated October 2, he disposed of the Spanish monarchy in favor\r\nof the Duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThis will was the work of the council of Spain, at the head of which sat\r\nCardinal Porto-Carrero.  “The national party,” says M. Mignet in his\r\n“Introduction aux Documents relatifs de la Succession d’Espagne,_\r\n“detested the Austrians because they had been so long in Spain; it liked\r\nthe French because they were no longer there.  The former had been there\r\ntime enough to weary by their dominion, whilst the latter were served by\r\nthe mere fact of their removal.”  Singlehanded, Louis XIV. appeared\r\npowerful enough to maintain the integrity of the Spanish monarchy before\r\nthe face and in the teeth of all the competitors.  “The King of Spain was\r\nbeginning to see the, things of this world by the light alone of that\r\nawful torch which is lighted to lighten the dying.” [_Memoires de St.\r\nSimon,_ t. iii.  p. 16]; wavering, irresolute, distracted within himself,\r\nhe asked the advice of Pope Innocent XII., who was favorable to France.\r\nThe hopes of Louis XIV. had not soared so high; on the 9th of November,\r\n1700, he heard at one and the same time of Charles II.’s death and the\r\ncontents of his will.\r\n\r\nIt was a solemn situation.  The acceptance by France of the King of\r\nSpain’s will meant war; the refusal did not make peace certain; in\r\ndefault of a French prince the crown was to go to Archduke Charles;\r\nneither Spain nor Austria would hear of dismemberment; could they be\r\nforced to accept the treaty of partition which they had hitherto rejected\r\nangrily?  The king’s council was divided; Louis XIV. listened in silence\r\nto the arguments of the dauphin and of the ministers; for a moment the\r\nresolution was taken of holding by the treaty of partition; next day the\r\nking again assembled his council without as yet making known his\r\ndecision; on Tuesday, November 16, the whole court thronged into the\r\ngalleries of Versailles; it was known that several couriers had arrived\r\nfrom Madrid; the king sent for the Spanish ambassador into his closet.\r\n“The Duke of Anjou had repaired thither by the back way,” says the Duke\r\nof St. Simon in his Memoires; the king, introducing him to him, told him\r\nhe might salute him as his king.  The instant afterwards the king,\r\ncontrary to all custom, had the folding-doors thrown open, and ordered\r\neverybody who was there--and there was a crowd--to come in; then, casting\r\nhis eyes majestically over the numerous company, “Gentlemen,” he said,\r\nintroducing the Duke of Anjou, “here is the King of Spain.  His birth\r\ncalled him to that crown; the last king gave it him by his will; the\r\ngrandees desired him, and have demanded him of me urgently; it is the\r\nwill of Heaven, and I have yielded with pleasure.”  And, turning to his\r\ngrandson, “Be a good Spaniard,” he said; “that is from this moment your\r\nfirst duty; but remember that you are French born in order to keep up the\r\nunion between the two nations; that is the way to render them happy and\r\nto preserve the peace of Europe.”  Three weeks later the young king was\r\non the road to Spain.  There are no longer any Pyrenees,” said Louis\r\nXIV., as he embraced his grandson.  The rights of Philip V. to the crown\r\nof France had been carefully reserved by a formal act of the king’s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Here is the King of Spain.”----475]\r\n\r\nGreat were the surprise and wrath in Europe; William III. felt himself\r\npersonally affronted.  “I have no doubt,” he wrote to Heinsius, “that\r\nthis unheard-of proceeding on the part of France has caused you as much\r\nsurprise as it has me; I never had much confidence in engagements\r\ncontracted with France, but I confess I never could have supposed that\r\nthat court would have gone so far as to break, in the face of Europe,\r\nso solemn a treaty before it had even received the finishing stroke.\r\nGranted that we have been dupes; but when, beforehand, you are resolved\r\nto hold your word of no account, it is not very difficult to overreach\r\nyour mail.  I shall be blamed perhaps for having relied upon France, I\r\nwho ought to have known by the experience of the past that no treaty has\r\never bound her!  Would to God I might be quit for the blame, but I have\r\nonly too many grounds for fearing that the fatal consequences of it will\r\nmake themselves felt shortly.  I groan in the very depths of my spirit to\r\nsee that in this country the majority rejoice to find the will preferred\r\nby France to the maintenance of the treaty of partition, and that too on\r\nthe ground that the will is more advantageous for England and Europe.\r\nThis opinion is founded partly on the youth of the Duke of Anjou.  ‘He is\r\na child,’ they say; ‘he will be brought up in Spain; he will be\r\nindoctrinated with the principles of that monarchy, and hee will be\r\ngoverned by the council of Spain;’ but these are surmises which it is\r\nimpossible for me to entertain, and I fear that we shall before long find\r\nout how erroneous they are.  Would it not seem as if this profound\r\nindifference with which, in this country, they look upon everything that\r\ntakes place outside of this island, were a punishment from Heaven?\r\nMeanwhile, are not our causes for apprehension and our interests the same\r\nas those of the peoples of the continent?”\r\n\r\nWilliam III. was a more far-sighted politician than his subjects either\r\nin England or Holland.  The States General took the same view as the\r\nEnglish.  “Public funds and shares have undergone a rise at Amsterdam,”\r\n wrote Heinsius to the King of Englaiid; “and although this rests on\r\nnothing solid, your Majesty is aware how much influence such a fact has.”\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. had lost no time in explaining to the powers the grounds of\r\nhis acceptance.  “The King of Spain’s will,” he said in his manifesto,\r\n“establishes the peace of Europe on solid bases.”  “Tallard did not utter\r\na single word on handing me his sovereign’s letter, the contents of which\r\nare the same as of that which the states have received,” wrote William to\r\nHeinsius.  “I said to him that perhaps I had testified too eager a desire\r\nfor the preservation of peace, but that, nevertheless, my inclination in\r\nthat respect had not changed.  Whereupon he replied, ‘The king my master,\r\nby accepting the will, considers that he gives a similar proof of his\r\ndesire to maintain peace.’  Thereupon he made me a bow and withdrew.”\r\n\r\nWilliam of Orange had not deceived himself in thinking that Louis XIV.\r\nwould govern Spain in his grandson’s name.  Nowhere are the old king’s\r\nexperience and judgment more strikingly displayed than in his letters to\r\nPhilip V.  “I very much wish,” he wrote to him, “that you were as sure of\r\nyour own subjects as you ought to be of mine in the posts in which they\r\nmay be employed; but do not be astounded at the disorder you find amongst\r\nyour troops, and at the little confidence you are able to place in them;\r\nit needs a long reign and great pains to restore order and secure the\r\nfidelity of different peoples accustomed to obey a house hostile to\r\nyours.  If you thought it would be very easy and very pleasant to be a\r\nking, you were very much mistaken.”  A sad confession for that powerful\r\nmonarch, who in his youth found “the vocation of king beautiful, noble,\r\nand delightful.”\r\n\r\n“The eighteenth century opened with a fulness of glory and unheard-of\r\nprosperity; “but Louis XIV.  did not suffer himself to be lulled to sleep\r\nby the apparent indifference with which Europe, the empire excepted,\r\nreceived the elevation of Philip V. to the throne of Spain.  On the 6th\r\nof February, 1701, the seven barrier towns of the Spanish Low Countries,\r\nwhich were occupied by Dutch garrisons in virtue of the peace of Ryswick,\r\nopened their gates to the French on an order from the King of Spain.\r\n“The instructions which the Elector of Bavaria, governor of the Low\r\nCountries, had given to the various governors of the places, were so well\r\nexecuted,” says M. de Vault in his account of the campaign in Flanders,\r\n“that we entered without any hinderance.  Some of the officers of the\r\nDutch troops grumbled, and would have complained, but the French general\r\nofficers who had led the troops pacified them, declaring that they did\r\nnot come as enemies, and that all they wanted was to live in good\r\nunderstanding with them.”\r\n\r\nThe twenty-two Dutch battalions took the road back before long to their\r\nown country, and became the nucleus of the army which William of Orange\r\nwas quietly getting ready in Holland as well as in England; his peoples\r\nwere beginning to open their eyes; the States General, deprived of the\r\nbarrier towns, had opened the dikes; the meadows were flooded.  On the\r\n7th of September, 1701, England and Holland signed for the second time\r\nwith the emperor a Grand Alliance, engaging not to lay down arms until\r\nthey had reduced the possessions of King Philip V. to Spain and the\r\nIndies, restored the barrier of Holland, and secured an indemnity to\r\nAustria, and the definitive severance of the two crowns of France and\r\nSpain.  In the month of June the Austrian army had entered Italy under\r\nthe orders of Prince Eugene of Savoy-Carignano, son of the Count of\r\nSoissons and Olympia Mancini, conqueror of the Turks and revolted\r\nHungarians, and passionately hostile to Louis XIV., who, in his youth,\r\nhad refused to employ him.  He had already crossed the Adige and the\r\nMincio, driving the French back behind the Oglio.  Marshal Catinat, a man\r\nof prudence and far-sightedness, but discouraged by the bad condition of\r\nhis troops, coldly looked upon at court, and disquieted by the aspect of\r\nthings in Italy, was acting supinely; the king sent Marshal Villeroi to\r\nsupersede him; Catinat, as modest as he was warmly devoted to the glory\r\nof his country, finished the campaign as a simple volunteer.\r\n\r\nThe King of France and the emperor were looking up allies.  The princes\r\nof the north were absorbed by the war which was being waged against his\r\nneighbors of Russia and Poland by the young King of Sweden, Charles XII.,\r\na hero of eighteen, as irresistible as Gustavus Adolphus in his impetuous\r\nbravery, without possessing the rare qualities of authority and judgment\r\nwhich had distinguished the Lion of the North.  He joined the Grand\r\nAlliance, as did Denmark and Poland, whose new king, the Elector of\r\nSaxony, had been supported by the emperor in his candidature and in his\r\nabjuration of Protestantism.  The Elector of Brandenburg, recently\r\nrecognized as King of Prussia under the name of Frederic I., and the new\r\nElector of Hanover were eager to serve Leopold, who had aided them in\r\ntheir elevation.  In Germany, only Maximilian, Elector of Bavaria,\r\ngovernor of the Low Countries, and his brother, the Elector of Cologne,\r\nembraced the side of France.  The Duke of Savoy, generalissimo of the\r\nking’s forces in Italy, had taken the command of the army.  “But in that\r\ncountry,” wrote the Count of Tesse, “there is no reliance to be placed on\r\nplaces, or troops, or officers, or people.  I have had another interview\r\nwith this incomprehensible prince, who received me with every\r\nmanifestation of kindness, of outward sincerity, and, if he were capable\r\nof it, I would say of friendship for him of whom his Majesty made use but\r\nlately in the work of peace in Italy.  ‘The king is master of my person,\r\nof my dominions,’ he said to me, ‘he has only to give his commands; but I\r\nsuppose that he still desires my welfare and my aggrandizement.’  ‘As for\r\nyour aggrandizement, Monseigneur,’ said I, ‘in truth I do not see much\r\nmaterial for it just at present; as for your welfare, we must be allowed\r\nto see your intentions a little more clearly first, and take the liberty\r\nof repeating to you that my prescience does not extend so far.  I do him\r\nthe justice to believe that he really feels the greater part of all that\r\nhe expresses for your Majesty; but that horrid habit of indecision and\r\nputting off till to-morrow what he might do to-day is not eradicated, and\r\nnever will be.’”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Savoy was not so undecided as M. de Tess supposed; he managed\r\nto turn to good account the mystery which hung habitually over all his\r\nresolutions.  A year had not rolled by, and he was openly engaged in the\r\nGrand Alliance, pursuing, against France, the cause of that\r\naggrandizement which he had but lately hoped to obtain from her, and\r\nwhich, by the treaty of Utrecht, was worth the title of king to him.\r\n\r\nPending the time to declare himself he had married his second  daughter,\r\nPrincess Marie Louise Gabrielle, to the young King of Spain, Philip V.\r\n\r\n“Never had the tranquillity of Europe been so unstable as it was at the\r\ncommencement of 1702,” says the correspondence of Chamillard, published\r\nby General Pelet; “it was but a phantom of peace that was enjoyed, and it\r\nwas clear, from whatever side matters were regarded, that we were on the\r\neve of a war which could not but be of long duration, unless, by some\r\nunforeseen accident, the houses of Bourbon and Austria should come to an\r\narrangement which would allow them to set themselves in accord touching\r\nthe Spanish succession; but there was no appearance of conciliation.”\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. had just done a deed which destroyed the last faint hopes of\r\npeace.  King James II. was dying at St. Germain, and the king went to see\r\nhim.  The sick man opened his eyes for a moment when he was told that the\r\nking was there [_Memoires de Dangeau,_ t. viii.  p. 192], and closed them\r\nagain immediately.  The king told him that he had come to assure him that\r\nhe might die in peace as regarded the Prince of Wales, and that he would\r\nrecognize him as King of England, Ireland, and Scotland.  All the English\r\nwho were in the room fell upon their knees, and cried, “God save the\r\nking!”  James II. expired a week later, on the 16th of September, 1701,\r\nsaying to his son, as his last advice, “I am about to leave this world,\r\nwhich has been to me nothing but a sea of tempests and storms.  The\r\nOmnipotent has thought right to visit me with great afflictions; serve\r\nHim with all your heart, and never place the crown of England in the\r\nbalance with your eternal salvation.”  James II. was justified in giving\r\nhis son this supreme advice the solitary ray of greatness in his life and\r\nin his soul had proceeded from his religious faith, and his unwavering\r\nresolution to remain loyal to it at any price and at any risk.\r\n\r\n“On returning to Marly,” says St. Simon, “the king told the whole court\r\nwhat he had just done.  There was nothing but acclamations and praises.\r\nIt was a fine field for them: but reflections, too, were not less prompt,\r\nif they were less public.  The king still flattered himself that he would\r\nhinder Holland and England, the former of which was so completely\r\ndependent, from breaking with him in favor of the house of Austria; he\r\nrelied upon that to terminate before long the war in Italy, as well as\r\nthe whole affair of the succession in Spain and its vast dependencies,\r\nwhich the emperor could not dispute with his own forces only, or even\r\nwith those of the empire.  Nothing, therefore, could be more incompatible\r\nwith this position, and with the solemn recognition he had given, at the\r\npeace of Ryswick, of the Prince of Orange as King of England.  It was to\r\nhurt him personally in the most sensitive spot, all England with him and\r\nHolland into the bargain, without giving the Prince of Wales, by\r\nrecognition, any solid support in his own case.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: News for William III.----481]\r\n\r\nWilliam III. was at table in his castle of Dieren, in Holland, when he\r\nreceived this news.  He did not utter a word, but he colored, crushed his\r\nhat over his head, and could not command his countenance.  The Earl of\r\nManchester, English ambassador, left Paris without taking leave of the\r\nking, otherwise than by this note to M. de Torcy:--\r\n\r\n“Sir:  The king my master, being informed that his Most Christian.\r\nMajesty has recognized another King of Great Britain, does not consider\r\nthat his dignity and his service will permit him to any longer keep an\r\nambassador at the court of the king your master, and he has sent me\r\norders to withdraw at once, of which I do myself the honor to advertise\r\nyou by this note.”\r\n\r\n“All the English,” says Torcy, in his Memoires, “unanimously regard it\r\nas a mortal affront on the part of France, that she should pretend to\r\narrogate to herself the right of giving them a king, to the prejudice of\r\nhim whom they had themselves invited and recognized for many years past.”\r\n\r\nVoltaire declares, in the “Siecle de Louis XIV.,_ that M. de Torcy\r\nattributed the recognition of the Prince of Wales by Louis XIV. to the\r\ninfluence of Madame de Maintenon, who was touched by the tears of the\r\nqueen, Mary of Modena.  “He had not,” he said, “inserted the fact in his\r\nMemoires, because he did not think it to his master’s honor that two\r\nwomen should have made him change a resolution to the contrary taken in\r\nhis council.”  Perhaps the deplorable state of William III.’s health, and\r\nthe inclination supposed to be felt by Princess Anne of Denmark to\r\nrestore the Stuarts to the throne, since she herself had lost the Duke of\r\nGloucester, the last survivor of her seventeen children, might have\r\ninfluenced the unfortunate resolution of Louis XIV.  His kingly\r\nmagnanimity and illusions might have bound him to support James II.,\r\ndethroned and fugitive; but no obligation of that sort existed in the\r\ncase of a prince who had left England at his nurse’s, breast, and who had\r\ngrown up in exile.  In the _Athalie_ of Racine, Joad (Jehoiada) invokes\r\nupon the impious queen:\r\n\r\n              “That spirit of infatuation and error\r\n               The fatal avant-courier of the fall of kings.”\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the Prince of Wales as King of England was, in the\r\ncase of Louis XIV., the most indisputable token of that fatal blindness.\r\n\r\nWilliam III. had paid dear for the honor of being called to the throne\r\nof England.  More than once he had been on the point of abandonhig the\r\nungrateful nation which so ill requited his great services; he had\r\nthought of returning to live in the midst of his Hollanders,\r\naffectionately attached to his family as well as to his person.  The\r\ninsult of the King of France restored to his already dying adversary all\r\nthe popularity he had lost.  When William returned from Holland to open a\r\nnew Parliament, on the 10th of January, 1702, manifestations of sympathy\r\nwere lavished upon him on all sides of the house.  “I have no doubt,”\r\n said he, “that the late proceedings of his Most Christian Majesty and the\r\ndangers which threaten all the powers of Europe have excited your most\r\nlively resentment.  All the world have their eyes fixed upon England;\r\nthere is still time, she may save her religion and her liberty, but let\r\nher profit by every moment, let her arm by land and sea, let her lend her\r\nallies all the assistance in her power, and swear to show her enemies,\r\nthe foes of her religion, her liberty, her government, and the king of\r\nher choice, all the hatred they deserve.”\r\n\r\nThis speech, more impassioned than the utterances of William III.\r\ngenerally were, met with an eager echo from his people; the houses voted\r\na levy of forty thousand sailors and fifty thousand soldiers; Holland had\r\npromised ninety thousand men; but the health of the King of England went\r\non declining; he had fallen from his horse on the 4th of March, and\r\nbroken his collarbone; this accident hastened the progress of the malady\r\nwhich was pulling him down; when his friend Keppel, whom he had made Earl\r\nof Albemarle, returned, on the 18th of March, from Holland, William\r\nreceived him with these words: “I am drawing towards my end.”\r\n\r\nHe had received the consolations of religion from the bishops, and had\r\ncommunicated with great self-possession; he scarcely spoke now, and\r\nbreathed with difficulty.  “Can this last long?” he asked the physician,\r\nwho made a sign in the negative.  He had sent for the Earl of Portland,\r\nBentinek, his oldest and most faithful friend; when he arrived, the king\r\ntook his hand and held it between both his own, upon his heart.  Thus he\r\nremained for a few moments; then he yielded up his great spirit to God,\r\non the 19th (8th) of March, 1702, at eight in the morning.  He was not\r\nyet fifty-two.\r\n\r\nIn a greater degree perhaps than any other period, the eighteenth century\r\nwas rich in men of the first order.  But never did more of the spirit of\r\npolicy, never did loftier and broader views, never did steadier courage\r\nanimate and sustain a weaker body than in the case of William of Orange.\r\nSavior of Holland at the age of twenty-two in the war against Louis XIV.,\r\nprotector of the liberties of England against the tyranny of James II.,\r\ndefender of the independence of the European states against the unbridled\r\nambition of the King of France, he became the head of Europe by the\r\nproper and free ascendency of his genius; cold and reserved, more capable\r\nof feeling than of testifying sympathy, often ill, always unfortunate in\r\nwar, he managed to make his will triumph, in England despite Jacobite\r\nplots and the jealous suspicions of the English Parliaments, in Holland\r\ndespite the constant efforts of the republican and aristocratic party,\r\nin Europe despite envy and the waverings of the allied sovereigns.\r\nIntrepid, spite of his bad health, to the extent of being ready, if need\r\nwere, to die in the last ditch, of indomitable obstinacy in his\r\nresolutions, and of rare ability in the manipulation of affairs, he was\r\none of those who are born masters of men, no matter what may at the\r\noutset be their condition and their destiny.  In vain had Cromwell\r\nrequired of Holland the abolition of the stadtholderate in the house of\r\nNassau, in vain had John van Witt obtained the voting of the perpetual\r\nedict, William of Orange lived and died stadtholder of Holland and king\r\nof that England which had wanted to close against him forever the\r\napproaches to the throne in his own native countiy.  When God has created\r\na man to play a part and hold a place in this world, all efforts and all\r\ncounsels to the contrary are but so many stalks of straw under his feet.\r\nWilliam of Orange at his death had accomplished his work: Europe had\r\nrisen against Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThe campaigns of 1702 and 1703 presented an alternation of successes and\r\nreverses favorable, on the whole, to France.  Marshal Villeroi had failed\r\nin Italy against Prince Eugene.  He was superseded by the Duke of\r\nVendome, grandson of Henry IV. and captor of Barcelona, indolent,\r\ndebauched, free in tone and in conduct, but able, bold, beloved by the\r\nsoldiers, and strongly supported at court.  Catinat had returned to\r\nFrance, and went to Versailles at the commencement of the year 1702.\r\n“M. de Chamillard had told him the day before, from the king, that his\r\nMajesty had resolved to give him the command of the army in Germany; he\r\nexcused himself for some time from accepting this employment; the king\r\nended by saying, ‘Now we are in a position for you to explain to me, and\r\nopen your heart about all that took place in Italy during the last\r\ncampaign.’  The marshal answered, ‘Sir, those things are all past; the\r\ndetails I could give you thereof would be of no good to the service of\r\nyour Majesty, and would serve merely, perhaps, to keep up eternal\r\nheart-burnings; and so I entreat you to be pleased to let me preserve a\r\nprofound silence as to all that.  I will only justify myself, sir, by\r\nthinking how I may serve you still better, if I can, in Germany than I\r\ndid in Italy.’”  Worn out and disgusted, Catinat failed in Germany as he\r\nhad in Italy; he took his retirement, and never left his castle of St.\r\nGratien any more: it was the Marquis of Villars, lately ambassador at\r\nVienna, who defeated the imperialists at Friedlingen, on the 14th of\r\nAugust, 1702; a month later Tallard retook the town of Landau.  The\r\nperfidious manoeuvres of the Duke of Savoy had just come to light.  The\r\nking ordered Vendome to disarm the five thousand Piedmontese who were\r\nserving in his army.  That operation effected, the prince sent Victor-\r\nAmadeo this note, written by Louis XIV.’s own hand:--\r\n\r\n“Sir:  As religion, honor, and your own signature count for nothing\r\nbetween us, I send my cousin, the Duke of Vendome, to, explain to you my\r\nwishes.  He will give you twenty-four hours to decide.”\r\n\r\nThe mind of the Duke of Savoy was made up, from this day forth the father\r\nof the Duchess of Burgundy and of the Queen of Spain took rank amongst\r\nthe declared enemies of France and Spain.\r\n\r\nWhilst Louis XIV. was facing Europe, in coalition against him, with\r\ngenerals of the second and third order, the allies were discovering in\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough a worthy rival of Prince Eugene.  A covetous and\r\nable courtier, openly disgraced by William III. in consequence of his\r\nperfidious intrigues with the court of St. Germain, he had found his\r\nfortunes suddenly retrieved by the accession of Queen Anne, over whom his\r\nwife had for a long time held the sway of a haughty and powerful\r\nfavorite.  The campaigns of 1702 and 1703 had shown him to be a prudent\r\nand a bold soldier, fertile in resources and novel conceptions; and those\r\nhad earned him the thanks of Parliament and the title of duke.  The\r\ncampaign of 1704 established his glory upon the misfortunes of France.\r\nMarshals Tallard and Marsin were commanding in Germany together with the\r\nElector of Bavaria; the emperor, threatened with a fresh insurrection in\r\nHungary, recalled Prince Eugene from Italy; Marlborough effected a\r\njunction with him by a rapid march, which Marshal Villeroi would fain\r\nhave hindered, but to no purpose; on the 13th of August, 1704, the\r\nhostile armies met between Blenheim and Hochstett, near the Danube; the\r\nforces were about equal, but on the French side the counsels were\r\ndivided, the various corps acted independently.  Tallard sustained\r\nsingle-handed the attack of the English and the Dutch, commanded by\r\nMarlborough; he was made prisoner, his son was killed at his side; the\r\ncavalry, having lost their leader and being pressed by the enemy, took to\r\nflight in the direction of the Danube; many officers and soldiers\r\nperished in the river; the slaughter was awful.  Marsin and the elector,\r\nwho had repulsed five successive charges of Prince Eugene, succeeded in\r\neffecting their retreat; but the electorates of Bavaria and Cologne were\r\nlost, Landau was recovered by the allies after a siege of two months, the\r\nFrench army recrossed the Rhine, Elsass was uncovered, and Germany\r\nevacuated.  In Spain the English had just made themselves masters of\r\nGibraltar.  “This shows clearly, sir,” wrote Tallard to Chamillard after\r\nthe defeat, “what is the effect of such diversity of counsel, which makes\r\npublic all that one intends to do, and it is a severe lesson never to\r\nhave more than one man at the head of an army.  It is a great misfortune\r\nto have to deal with a prince of such a temper as the Elector of\r\nBavaria.”  Villars was of the same opinion; it had been his fate, in the\r\ncampaign of 1703, to come to open loggerheads with the elector.  “The\r\nking’s army will march to-morrow, as I have had the honor to tell your\r\nHighness,” he had declared.  “At these words,” says Villars, the blood\r\nmounted to his face; he threw his hat and wig on the table in a rage.\r\n‘I commanded,’ said he, ‘the emperor’s army in conjunction with the Duke\r\nof Lorraine; he was a tolerably great general, and he never treated me in\r\nthis manner.’  ‘The Duke of Lorraine,’ answered I, ‘was a great prince\r\nand a great general; but, for myself, I am responsible to the king for\r\nhis army, and I will not expose it to destruction through the evil\r\ncounsels so obstinately persisted in.’  Thereupon I went out of the\r\nroom.”  Complete swaggerer as he was, Villars had more wits and\r\nresolution than the majority of the generals left to Louis XIV., but in\r\n1704 he was occupied in putting down the insurrection of the Camisards in\r\nthe south of France: neither Tallard nor Marsin had been able to impose\r\ntheir will upon the elector.  In 1705 Villars succeeded in checking the\r\nmovement of Marlborough on Lothringen and Champagne.  “He flattered\r\nhimself he would swallow me like a grain of salt,” wrote the marshal.\r\nThe English fell back, hampered in their adventurous plans by the\r\nprudence of the Hollanders, controlled from a distance by the grand\r\npensionary Heinsius.  The imperialists were threatening Elsass; the\r\nweather was fearful; letters had been written to Chamillard to say that\r\nthe inundations alone would be enough to prevent the enemy from investing\r\nFort Louis.  “There is nothing so nice as a map,” replied Villars; “with\r\na little green and blue one puts under water all that one wishes but a\r\ngeneral who goes and examines it, as I have done, finds in divers places\r\ndistances of a mile where these little rivers, which are supposed to\r\ninundate the country, are quite snug in their natural bed, larger than\r\nusual, but not enough to hinder the enemy in any way in the world from\r\nmaking bridges.”  Fort Louis was surrounded, and Villars found himself\r\nobliged to retire upon Strasburg, whence he protected Elsass during the\r\nwhole campaign of 1706.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Hochstett, in 1704, had been the first step down the\r\nladder; the defeat of Ramillies, on the 23d of May, 1706, was the second\r\nand the fatal rung.  The king’s personal attachment to Marshal Villeroi\r\nblinded him as to his military talents.  Beaten in Italy by Prince\r\nEugene, Villeroi, as presumptuous as he was incapable, hoped to retrieve\r\nhimself against Marlborough.  “The whole army breathed nothing but\r\nbattle; I know it was your Majesty’s own feeling,” wrote Villeroi to the\r\nking, after the defeat: “could I help committing myself to a course which\r\nI considered expedient?”  The marshal had deceived himself as regarded\r\nhis advantages, as well as the confidence of his troops; there had been\r\neight hours’ fighting at Hochstett, inflicting much damage upon the\r\nenemy; at Ramillies, the Bavarians took to their heels at the end of an\r\nhour; the French, who felt that they were badly commanded, followed their\r\nexample; the rout was terrible, and the disorder inexpressible.  Villeroi\r\nkept recoiling before the enemy, Marlborough kept advancing; two thirds\r\nof Belgium and sixteen strong places were lost, when Louis XIV. sent\r\nChamillard into the Low Countries; it was no longer the time when Louvois\r\nmade armies spring from the very soil, and when Vauban prepared the\r\ndefence of Dunkerque.  The king recalled Villeroi, showing him to the\r\nlast unwavering kindness.  “There is no more luck at our age, marshal,”\r\n was all he said to Villeroi, on his arrival at Versailles.  “He was\r\nnothing more than an old wrinkled balloon, out of which all the gas that\r\ninflated it has gone,” says St.  Simon: “he went off to Paris and to\r\nVilleroi, having lost all the varnish that made him glitter, and having\r\nnothing more to show but the under-stratum.”\r\n\r\nThe king summoned Vendome, to place him at the head of the army of\r\nFlanders, “in hopes of restoring to it the spirit of vigor and audacity\r\nnatural to the French nation,” as he himself says.  For two years past,\r\namidst a great deal of ill-success, Vendome had managed to keep in check\r\nVictor-Amadeo and Prince Eugene, in spite of the embarrassment caused him\r\nby his brother the grand prior, the Duke of La Feuillade, Chamillard’s\r\nson-in-law, and the orders which reached him directly from the king; he\r\nhad gained during his two campaigns the name of taker of towns, and had\r\njust beaten the Austrians in the battle of Cascinato.  Prince Eugene had,\r\nhowever, crossed the Adige and the Po when Vendome left Italy.\r\n\r\n“Everybody here is ready to take off his hat when Marlborough’s name is\r\nmentioned,” he wrote to Chamillard, on arriving in Flanders.  The English\r\nand Dutch army occupied all the country from Ostend to Maestricht.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Orleans, nephew of the king, had succeeded the Duke of\r\nVendome.  He found the army in great disorder, the generals divided and\r\ninsubordinate, Turin besieged according to the plans of La Feuillade,\r\nagainst the advice of Vauban, who had offered “to put his marshal’s baton\r\nbehind the door, and confine himself to giving his counsels for the\r\ndirection of the siege;” the prince, in his irritation, resigned his\r\npowers into the hands of Marshal Marsin; Prince Eugene, who had effected\r\nhis junction with Victor-Amadeo, encountered the French army between the\r\nRivers Doria and Stora.  The soldiers remembered the Duke of Orleans at\r\nSteinkirk and Neerwinden; they asked him if he would grudge them his\r\nsword.  He yielded, and was severely wounded at the battle of Turin, on\r\nthe 7th of September, 1706; Marsin was killed, discouragement spread\r\namongst the generals and the troops, and the siege of Turin was raised;\r\nbefore the end of the year, nearly all the places were lost, and Dauphiny\r\nwas threatened.  Victor-Amadeo refused to listen to a special peace: in\r\nthe month of March, 1707, the Prince of Vaudemont, governor of Milaness\r\nfor the King of Spain, signed a capitulation, at Mantua, and led back to\r\nFrance the troops which still remained to him.  The imperialists were\r\nmasters of Naples.  Spain no longer had any possessions in Italy.\r\n\r\nPhilip V. had been threatened with the loss of Spain as well as of Italy.\r\nFor two years past Archduke Charles, under the title of Charles III.,\r\nhad, with the support of England and Portugal, been disputing the crown\r\nwith the young king.  Philip V. had lost Catalonia, and had just failed\r\nin his attempt to retake Barcelona; the road to Madrid was cut off, the\r\narmy was obliged to make its way by Roussillon and Warn to resume the\r\ncampaign; the king threw himself in person into his capital, whither he\r\nwas escorted by Marshal Berwick, a natural son of James II., a Frenchman\r\nby choice, full of courage and resolution, “but a great stick of an\r\nEnglishman, who hadn’t a word to say,” and who was distasteful to the\r\nyoung queen, Marie-Louise.  Philip V. could not remain at Madrid, which\r\nwas threatened by the enemy: he removed to Burgos; the English entered\r\nthe capital, and there proclaimed Charles III.\r\n\r\nThis was too, much; Spain could not let herself submit to have an\r\nAustrian king imposed upon her by heretics and Portuguese; the old\r\nmilitary energy appeared again amongst that people besotted by priests\r\nand ceremonials; war broke out all at once at every point; the foreign\r\nsoldiers were everywhere attacked openly or secretly murdered; the towns\r\nrose; a few horsemen sufficed for Berwick to recover possession of\r\nMadrid; the king entered it once more, on the 4th of October, amidst the\r\ncheers of his people, whilst Berwick was pursuing the enemy, whom he had\r\ncornered (_rencogne_), he says, in the mountains of Valencia.  Charles\r\nIII. had no longer anything left in Spain but Aragon and Catalonia.  The\r\nFrench garrisons, set free by the evacuation of Italy, went to the aid of\r\nthe Spaniards.  “Your enemies ought not to hope for success,” wrote Louis\r\nXIV. to his grandson, “since their progress has served only to bring out\r\nthe courage and fidelity of a nation always equally brave and firmly\r\nattached to its masters.  I am told that your people cannot be\r\ndistinguished from regular troops.  We have not been fortunate in\r\nFlanders, but we must submit to the judgment of God.”  He had already let\r\nhis grandson understand that a great sacrifice would be necessary to\r\nobtain peace, which he considered himself bound to procure before long\r\nfor his people.  The Hollanders refused their mediation.  “The three men\r\nwho rule in Europe, to wit, the grand pensionary Heinsius, the Duke of\r\nMarlborough, and Prince Eugene, desire war for their own interests,” was\r\nthe saying in France.  The campaign of 1707 was signalized in Spain by\r\nthe victory of Almanza, gained on the 13th of April by Marshal Berwick\r\nover the Anglo-Portuguese army, and by the capture of Lerida, which\r\ncapitulated on the 11th of November into the hands of the Duke of\r\nOrleans.  In Germany, Villars drove back the enemy from the banks of the\r\nRhine, advanced into Suabia, and ravaged the Palatinate, crushing the\r\ncountry with requisitions, of which he openly reserved a portion for\r\nhimself.  “Marshal Villars is doing very well for himself,” said\r\nsomebody, one day, to the king.  “Yes,” answered his Majesty, “and for me\r\ntoo.”  “I wrote to the king that I really must fat my calf,” said\r\nVillars.\r\n\r\nThe inexhaustible elasticity and marvellous resources of France were\r\nenough to restore some hope in 1707.  The invasion of Provence by Victor-\r\nAmadeo and Prince Eugene, their check before Toulon, and their retreat,\r\nprecipitated by the rising of the peasants, had irritated the allies; the\r\nattempts at negotiation which the king had entered upon at the Hague\r\nremained without result; the Duke of Burgundy took the command of the\r\narmies of Flanders, with Vendome for his second; it was hoped that the\r\nlieutenant’s boldness, his geniality towards the troops, and his\r\nconsummate knowledge of war, would counterbalance the excessive gravity,\r\nausterity, and inexperience of the young prince so virtuous and capable,\r\nbut reserved, cold, and unaccustomed to command; discord arose amongst\r\nthe courtiers; on the 5th of July Ghent was surprised; Vendome had\r\nintelligence inside the place, the Belgians were weary of their new\r\nmasters.  “The States have dealt so badly with this country,” said\r\nMarlborough, “that all the towns are ready to play us the same trick as\r\nGhent, the moment they have the opportunity.”  Bruges opened its gates to\r\nthe French.  Prince Eugene advanced to second Marlborough, but he was\r\nlate in starting; the troops of the Elector of Bavaria harassed his\r\nmarch.  “I shouldn’t like to say a word against Prince Eugene,” said\r\nMarlborough, “but he will arrive at the appointed spot on the Moselle ten\r\ndays too late.”  The English were by themselves when they encountered the\r\nFrench army in front of Audernarde.  The engagement began.  Vendome, who\r\ncommanded the right wing, sent word to the Duke of Burgundy.  The latter\r\nhesitated and delayed; the generals about him did not approve of\r\nVendome’s movement.  He fought single-handed, and was beaten.  The excess\r\nof confidence of one leader, and the inertness of the other, caused\r\nfailure in all the operations of the campaign; Prince Eugene and the Duke\r\nof Marlborough laid siege to Lille, which was defended by old Marshal\r\nBoufflers, the bravest and the most respected of all the king’s servants.\r\nLille was not relieved, and fell on the 25th of October; the citadel held\r\nout until the 9th of December; the king heaped rewards on Marshal\r\nBouffers: at the march out from Lille, Prince Eugene had ordered all his\r\narmy to pay him the same honors as to himself.  Ghent and Bruges were\r\nabandoned to the imperialists.  “We had made blunder upon blunder in this\r\ncampaign,” says Marshal Berwick, in his Memoires, “and, in spite of all\r\nthat if somebody had not made the last in giving up Ghent and Bruges,\r\nthere would have been a fine game the year after.”  The Low Countries\r\nwere lost, and the French frontier was encroached upon by the capture of\r\nLille.  For the first time, in a letter addressed to Marshal Berwick,\r\nMarlborough let a glimpse be seen of a desire to make peace; the king\r\nstill hoped for the mediation of Holland, and he neglected the overtures\r\nof Marlborough: “the army of the allies is, without doubt, in evil\r\nplight,” said Chamillard.\r\n\r\nThe campaign in Spain had not been successful; the Duke of Orleans, weary\r\nof his powerlessness, and under suspicion at the court of Philip V., had\r\ngiven up the command of the troops; the English admiral, Leake, had taken\r\npossession of Sardinia, of the Island of Minorca, and of Port Mahon; the\r\narchduke was master of the isles and of the sea.  The destitution in\r\nFrance was fearful, and the winter so severe that the poor were in want\r\nof everything; riots multiplied in the towns; the king sent his plate to\r\nthe mint, and put his jewels in pawn; he likewise took a resolution which\r\ncost him even more; he determined to ask for peace.\r\n\r\n“Although his courage appeared at every trial,” says the Marquis of\r\nTorcy, “he felt within him just sorrow for a war whereof the weight\r\noverwhelmed his subjects.  More concerned for their woes than for his own\r\nglory, he employed, to terminate them, means which might have induced\r\nFrance to submit to the hardest conditions before obtaining a peace that\r\nhad become necessary, if God, protecting the king, had not, after\r\nhumiliating him, struck his foes with blindness.”\r\n\r\nThere are regions to which superior minds alone ascend, and which are not\r\nattained by the men, however distinguished, who succeed them.  William\r\nIII. was no longer at the head of affairs in Europe; and the triumvirate\r\nof Heinsius, Marlborough, and Prince Eugene did not view the aggregate of\r\nthings from a sufficiently calm height to free themselves from the\r\nhatreds and, bitternesses of the strife, when the proposals of Louis XIV.\r\narrived at the Hague.  “Amidst the sufferings caused to commerce by the\r\nwar, there was room to hope,” says Torcy, “that the grand pensionary,\r\nthinking chiefly of his country’s interest, would desire the end of a war\r\nof which he felt all the burdensomeness.  Clothed with authority in his\r\nown republic, he had no reason to fear either secret design or cabals to\r\ndisplace him from a post which he filled to the satisfaction of his\r\nmasters, and in which he conducted himself with moderation.  Up to that\r\ntime the United Provinces had borne the principal burden of the war.  The\r\nemperor alone reaped the fruit of it.  One would have said that the\r\nHollanders kept the temple of peace, and that they had the keys of it in\r\ntheir hands.”\r\n\r\nThe king offered the Hollanders a very extended barrier in the Low\r\nCountries, and all the facilities they had long been asking for their\r\ncommerce.  He accepted the abandonment of Spain to the archduke, and\r\nmerely claimed to reserve to his grandson Naples, Sardinia, and Sicily.\r\nThis was what was secured to him by the second treaty of partition lately\r\nconcluded between England, tine United Provinces, and France; he did not\r\neven demand Lothringen.  President Rouille, formerly French envoy to\r\nLisbon, arrived disguised in Holland; conferences were opened secretly at\r\nBodegraven.\r\n\r\nThe treaties of partition negotiated by William of Orange, as well as\r\nthe wars which he had sustained against Louis XIV. with such persistent\r\nobstinacy, had but one sole end, the maintenance of the European\r\nequilibrium between the houses of Bourbon and Austria, which were alone\r\npowerful enough to serve as mutual counterpoise.  To despoil one to the\r\nprofit of the other, to throw, all at once, into the balance on the side\r\nof the empire all the weight of the Spanish succession, was to destroy\r\nthe work of William III.’s far-sighted wisdom.  Heinsius did not see it;\r\nbut led on by his fidelity to the allies, distrustful and suspicious as\r\nregarded France, burning to avenge the wrongs put upon the republic, he,\r\nin concert with Marlborough and Prince Eugene, required conditions so\r\nhard that the French agent scarcely dared transmit them to Versailles.\r\nWhat was demanded was the abdication, pure and simple, of Philip V.:\r\nHolland merely promised her good offices to obtain in his favor Naples\r\nand Sicily; England claimed Dunkerque; Germany wanted Strasburg and the\r\nrenewal of the peace of Westphalia; Victor-Amadeo aspired to recover Nice\r\nand Savoy; to the Dutch barrier stipulated for at Ryswick were to be\r\nadded Lille, Conde, and Tournay.  In vain was the matter discussed\r\narticle by article; Rouille for some time believed that he had gained\r\nLille.  “You misinterpreted our intentions,” said the deputies of the\r\nStates General; “we let you believe what you pleased; at the commencement\r\nof April.  Lille was still in a bad condition; we had reason to fear that\r\nthe French had a design of taking advantage of that; it was a matter of\r\nprudence to let you believe that it would be restored to you by the\r\npeace.  Lille is at the present moment in a state of security; do not\r\ncount any longer on its restitution.”  “Probably,” said the States’\r\ndelegate to Marlborough, “the king will break off negotiations rather\r\nthan entertain such hard conditions.”  “So much the worse for France,”\r\n rejoined the English general; “for when the campaign is once begun,\r\nthings will go farther than the king thinks.  The allies will never unsay\r\ntheir preliminary demands.”  And he set out for England without even\r\nwaiting for a favorable wind to cross.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. assembled his council, the same which, in 1700, had decided\r\nupon acceptance of the crown of Spain.  “The king felt all these\r\ncalamities so much the more keenly,” says Torcy, “in that he had\r\nexperienced nothing of the sort ever since he had taken into his own\r\nhands the government of a flourishing kingdom.  It was a terrible\r\nhumiliation for a monarch accustomed to conquer, belauded for his\r\nvictories, his triumphs, his moderation when he granted peace and\r\nprescribed its laws, to see himself now obliged to ask it of his enemies,\r\nto offer them to no purpose, in order to obtain it, the restitution of a\r\nportion of his conquests, the monarchy of Spain, the abandonment of his\r\nallies, and forced, in order to get such offers accepted, to apply to\r\nthat same republic whose principal provinces he had conquered in the year\r\n1692, and whose submission he had rejected when she entreated him to\r\ngrant her peace on such terms as he should be pleased to dictate.  The\r\nking bore so sensible a change with the firmness of a hero, and with a\r\nChristian’s complete submission to the decrees of Providence, being less\r\naffected by his own inward pangs than by the suffering of his people, and\r\nbeing ever concerned about the means of relieving it, and terminating the\r\nwar.  It was scarcely perceived that he did himself some violence in\r\norder to conceal his own feelings from the public; indeed; they were so\r\nlittle known that it was pretty generally believed that, thinking more of\r\nhis own glory than of the woes of his kingdom, he preferred to the\r\nblessing of peace the keeping of certain places he had taken in person.\r\nThis unjust opinion had crept in even amongst the council.”\r\n\r\nThe reading of the Dutch proposals tore away every veil; “the necessity\r\nof obtaining peace, whatever price it might cost, was felt so much the\r\nmore.”  The king gave orders to Rouille to resume the conferences,\r\ndemanding clear and precise explanations.  “If the worst comes to the\r\nworst,” said he, “I will give up Lille to the Hollanders, Strasburg\r\ndismantled to the Empire, and I will content myself with Naples without\r\nSicily for my grandson.  You will be astounded at the orders contained in\r\nthis despatch, so different from those that I have given you hitherto,\r\nand that I considered, as it was, too liberal, but I have always\r\nsubmitted to the divine will, and the evils with which He is pleased to\r\nafflict my kingdom do not permit me any longer to doubt of the sacrifice\r\nHe requires me to make to Him of all that might touch me most nearly.  I\r\nwaive, therefore, my glory.”  The Marquis of Torcy, secretary of state\r\nfor foreign affairs, followed close after the despatch; he had offered\r\nthe king to go and treat personally with Heinsius.\r\n\r\n“The grand pensionary appeared surprised when he heard that his Majesty\r\nwas sending one of his ministers to Holland.  He had been placed at that\r\npost by the Prince of Orange, who put entire confidence in him.  Heinsius\r\nhad not long before been sent to France to confer with Louvois, and, in\r\nthe discharge of that commission, he had experienced the bad temper of a\r\nminister more accustomed to speak harshly to military officers than to\r\ntreat with foreigners; he had not forgotten that the minister had\r\nthreatened to have him put in the Bastille.  Consummate master of\r\naffairs, of which he had a long experience, he was the soul of the league\r\nwith Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough; but the pensionary was\r\nnot accused either of being so much in love with the importance given him\r\nby continuance of the war as to desire its prolongation or of any\r\npersonally interested view.  His externals were simple, there was no\r\nostentation in his household; his address was cold without any sort of\r\nrudeness, his conversation was polished, he rarely grew warm in\r\ndiscussion.”  Torcy could not obtain anything from Heinsius, any more\r\nthan from Marlborough and Prince Eugene, who had both arrived at the\r\nHague: the prince remained cold and stern; he had not forgotten the\r\nking’s behavior towards his house.  “That’s a splendid post in France,\r\nthat of colonel general,” said he one day; “my father held it; at his\r\ndeath we hoped that my brother might get it; the king thought it better\r\nto give it to one of his, natural sons.  He is master, but all the same\r\nis one not sorry sometimes to find one’s self in a position to make\r\nslights repented of.”  “Marlborough displayed courtesy, insisting upon\r\nseeing in the affairs of the coalition the finger of God, who had\r\npermitted eight nations to think and act like one man.”  The concessions\r\nextorted from France were no longer sufficient: M. de Torcy gave up\r\nSicily, and then Naples; a demand was made for Elsass, and certain places\r\nin Dauphiny and Provence; lastly, the allies required that the conditions\r\nof peace should be carried out at short notice, during the two months’\r\ntruce it was agreed to grant, and that Louis XIV. should forthwith put\r\ninto the hands of the Hollanders three places by way of guarantee, in\r\ncase Philip V. should refuse to abdicate.  This was to despoil himself\r\nprematurely and gratuitously, for it was impossible to execute the\r\ndefinitive treaty of peace at the time fixed.  “The king did not hesitate\r\nabout the only course there was for him to take, not only for his own\r\nglory, but for the welfare of his kingdom,” says Torcy; he recalled his\r\nenvoys, and wrote to the governors of the provinces and towns,--\r\n\r\n“Sir:  The hope of an imminent peace was so generally diffused throughout\r\nmy kingdom, that I consider it due to the fidelity which my people have\r\nshown during the course of my reign to give them the consolation of\r\ninforming them of the reasons which still prevent them from enjoying the\r\nrepose I had intended to procure for them.  I would, to restore it, have\r\naccepted conditions much opposed to the security of my frontier\r\nprovinces; but the more readiness and desire I displayed to dissipate the\r\nsuspicions which my enemies affect to retain of my power and my designs,\r\nthe more did they multiply their pretensions, refusing to enter into any\r\nundertaking beyond putting a stop to all acts of hostility until the\r\nfirst of the month of August, reserving to themselves the liberty of then\r\nacting by way of arms if the King of Spain, my grandson, persisted in his\r\nresolution to defend the crown which God has given him; such a suspension\r\nwas more dangerous than war for my people, for it secured to the enemy\r\nmore important advantages than they could hope for from their troops.  As\r\nI place my trust in the protection of God, and hope that the purity of my\r\nintentions will bring down His blessing on my arms, I wish my people to\r\nknow that they would enjoy peace if it had depended only on my will to\r\nprocure them a boon which they reasonably, desire, but which must be won\r\nby fresh efforts, since the immense conditions I would have granted are\r\nuseless for the restoration of the public peace.\r\n\r\n“Signed:  Louis.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the mistakes due to his past arrogance, the king had a\r\nright to make use of such language.  In their short-sighted resentment\r\nthe allies had overstepped reason.  The young King of Spain felt this\r\nwhen he wrote to his grandfather, “I am transfixed at the chimerical and\r\ninsolent pretensions of the English and Dutch regarding the preliminaries\r\nof peace; never were seen the like.  I am beside myself at the idea that\r\nanybody could have so much as supposed that I should be forced to leave\r\nSpain as long as I have a drop of blood in my veins.  I will use all my\r\nefforts to maintain myself upon a throne on which God has placed me, and\r\non which you, after Him, have set me, and nothing but death shall wrench\r\nme from it or make me yield it.”  War re-commenced on all sides.  The\r\nking had just consented at last to give Chamillard his discharge.  “Sir,\r\nI shall die over the job,” had for a long time been the complaint of the\r\nminister worn out with fatigue.  “Ah!  well, we will die together,” had\r\nbeen the king’s rejoinder.\r\n\r\nFrance was dying, and Chamillard was by no means a stranger to the cause.\r\nLouis XIV. put in his place Voysin, former superintendent of Hainault,\r\nentirely devoted to Madame de Maintenon.  He loaded with benefits the\r\nminister from whom he was parting, the only one whom he had really loved.\r\nThe troops were destitute of everything.  On assuming the command of the\r\narmy of the Low Countries, Villars wrote in despair, “Imagine the horror\r\nof seeing an army without bread!  There was none delivered to-day until\r\nthe evening, and very late.  Yesterday, to have bread to serve out to the\r\nbrigades I had ordered to march, I made those fast that remained behind.\r\nOn these occasions I pass along the ranks, I coax the soldier, I speak to\r\nhim in such a way as to make him have patience, and I have had the\r\nconsolation of hearing several of them say, ‘The marshal is quite right;\r\nwe must suffer sometimes.’  ‘_Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie_’\r\n(give us this day our daily bread), the men say to me as I go through the\r\nranks; it is a miracle how we subsist, and it is a marvel to see the\r\nsteadiness and fortitude of the soldier in enduring hunger; habit is\r\neverything; I fancy, however, that the habit of not eating is not easy\r\nto acquire.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of such privations and sufferings, Villars found the army in\r\nexcellent spirits, and urged the king to permit him to give battle.\r\n“M. de Turenne used to say that he who means to altogether avoid battle\r\ngives up his country to him who appears to seek it,” the marshal assured\r\nhim; the king was afraid of losing his last army; the Dukes of Harcourt\r\nand Berwick were covering the Rhine and the Alps; Marlborough and Prince\r\nEugene, who had just made themselves masters of Tournay, marched against\r\nVillars, whom they encountered on the 11th of September, 1709, near the\r\nhamlet of Malplaquet.  Marshal Boufflers had just reached the army to\r\nserve as a volunteer.  Villars had intrenched himself in front of the\r\nwoods; his men were so anxious to get under fire, that they threw away\r\nthe rations of bread just served out; the allies looked sulkily at the\r\nworks.  “We are going to fight moles again,” they said.\r\n\r\nThere was a thick fog, as at Lutzen; the fighting went on from seven in\r\nthe morning till midday.  Villars had yielded the right wing, by way of\r\nrespect, to Bouffiers as his senior, says the allies’ account, but the\r\ngeneral command nevertheless devolved entirely upon him.  “At the hottest\r\nof the engagement, the marshal galloped furiously to the centre attacked\r\nby Prince Eugene.  It was a sort of jaws of hell, a pit of fire, sulphur,\r\nand saltpetre, which it seemed impossible to approach and live.  One shot\r\nand my horse fell,” says Villars.  “I jumped up, and a second broke my\r\nknee; I had it bandaged on the spot, and myself placed in a chair to\r\ncontinue giving my orders, but the pain caused a fainting-fit which\r\nlasted long enough for me to be carried off without consciousness to\r\nQuesnoy.”  The Prince of Hesse, with the imperial cavalry, had just\r\nturned the intrenchments, which the Dutch infantry had attacked to no\r\npurpose; Marshal Boufflers was obliged to order a retreat, which was\r\nexecuted as on parade.  “The allies had lost more than twenty thousand\r\nmen,” according to their official account.  “It was too much for this\r\nvictory, which did not entail the advantage of entirely defeating the\r\nenemy, and the whole fruits of which were to end with the taking of\r\nMons.”  Always a braggart, in spite of his real courage and indisputable\r\nmilitary talent, Villars wrote from his bed to the king, on sending him\r\nthe flags taken from the enemy, “If God give us grace to lose such\r\nanother battle, your Majesty may reckon that your enemies are\r\nannihilated.”  Boufflers was more proud, and at the same time more\r\nmodest, when he said, “The series of disasters that have for some years\r\npast befallen your Majesty’s arms, had so humiliated the French nation\r\nthat one scarcer dared avow one’s self a Frenchman.  I dare assure you,\r\nsir, that the French name was never in so great esteem, and was never\r\nperhaps more feared, than it is at present in the army of the allies.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bivouac of Louis XIV.----503]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. was no longer in a position to delude himself, and to\r\ncelebrate a defeat, even a glorious one, as a victory.  Negotiations\r\nrecommenced.  Heinsius had held to his last proposals.  It was on this\r\nsorry basis that Marshal d’Huxelles and Abbe de Polignac began the\r\nparleys, at Gertruydenberg, a small fortress of Mardyk.  They lasted from\r\nMarch 9 to July 25, 1710; the king consented to give some fortresses as\r\nguarantee, and promised to recommend his grandson to abdicate; in case of\r\nrefusal, he engaged not only to support him no longer, but to furnish the\r\nallies, into the bargain, with a monthly subsidy of a million, whilst\r\ngranting a passage through French territory; he accepted the cession of\r\nElsass to Lothringen, the return of the three bishoprics to the empire;\r\nthe, Hollanders, commissioned to negotiate in the name of the coalition,\r\nwere not yet satisfied.  “The desire of the allies,” they said, “is, that\r\nthe king should undertake, himself alone and by his own forces, either to\r\npersuade or to oblige the King of Spain to give up all his monarchy.\r\nNeither money nor the co-operation of the French troops suit their\r\npurpose; if the preliminary articles be not complied with in the space of\r\ntwo months, the truce is broken off, war will recommence, even though on\r\nthe part of the king the other conditions should have been wholly\r\nfulfilled.  The sole means of obtaining peace is to receive from the\r\nking’s hands Spain and the Indies.”\r\n\r\nThe French plenipotentiaries had been recommended to have patience.\r\nMarshal d’Huxelles was a courtier as smooth as he was clever; Abbe de\r\nPolignac was shrewd and supple, yet he could not contain his indignation.\r\n“It is evident that you have not been accustomed to conquer!” said he\r\nhaughtily to the Dutch delegates.  When the allies’ ultimatum reached the\r\nking, the pride of the sovereign and the affection of the father rose up\r\nat last in revolt.  “Since war there must be,” said he, “I would rather\r\nwage it against my enemies than against my grandson;” and he withdrew all\r\nthe concessions which had reduced Philip V. to despair.  The allies had\r\nalready invaded Artois; at the end of the campaign they were masters of\r\nDouai, St. Venant, Bethune, and Aire; France was threatened everywhere,\r\nthe king could no longer protect the King of Spain; he confined himself\r\nto sending him Vendome.  Philip V., sustained by the indomitable courage\r\nof his young wife, refused absolutely to abdicate.  “Whatever misfortunes\r\nmay await me,” he wrote to the king, “I still prefer the course of\r\nsubmission to whatever it may please God to decide for me by fighting to\r\nthat of deciding for myself by consenting to an arrangement which would\r\nforce me to abandon the people on whom my reverses have hitherto produced\r\nno other effect than to increase their zeal and affection for me.”\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, with none but the forces of Spain that Philip V., at\r\nthe outset of the campaign of 1710, found himself confronting the English\r\nand Portuguese armies.  The Emperor Joseph, brother of Archduke Charles,\r\nhad sent him a body of troops commanded by a distinguished general, Count\r\nvon Stahrenberg.  Going from defeat to defeat, the young king found\r\nhimself forced, as in 1706, to abandon his capital; he removed the seat\r\nof government to Valladolid, and departed, accompanied by more than\r\nthirty thousand persons of every rank, resolved to share his fortunes.\r\nThe archduke entered Madrid.  “I have orders from Queen Anne and the\r\nallies to escort King Charles to Madrid,” said the English general, Lord\r\nStanhope; when he is once there, God or the devil keep him in or turn him\r\nout; it matters little to me; that is no affair of mine.”\r\n\r\nStanhope was in the right not to pledge himself; the hostility of the\r\npopulation of Madrid did not permit the archduke to reside there long;\r\nafter running the risk of being carried off in his palace on the Prado,\r\nhe removed to Toledo; Vendome blocked the road against the Portuguese;\r\nthe archduke left the town, and withdrew into Catalonia; Stahrenberg\r\nfollowed him on the 22d of November, harassed on his march by the Spanish\r\nguerrillas rising everywhere upon his route; every straggler, every\r\nwounded man, was infallibly murdered by the peasants; Stanhope, who\r\ncommanded the rearguard, found himself invested by Vendome in the town of\r\nBrihuega; the Spaniards scarcely gave the artillery time to open a\r\nbreach, the town was taken by assault, and the English made prisoners.\r\nStahrenberg retraced his steps; on the 10th of December fighting began\r\nnear Villaviciosa; the advantage was for a long time undecided and\r\ndisputed; night came; the Austrian general spiked his guns and retreated\r\nby forced marches; the Spaniards bivouacked on the battle-field, the king\r\nslept on a bed made of the enemy’s flags; the allies had taken refuge in\r\nCatalonia; Spain had won back her independence and her king.  There was\r\ngreat joy at Versailles, greater than in the kingdom; the sole aspiration\r\nwas for peace.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected assistance was at hand.  Queen Anne, wearied with the\r\ncupidity and haughtiness of the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough, had\r\ngiven them notice to quit; the friends of the duke had shared his fall,\r\nand the Tories succeeded the Whigs in power.  The chancellor of the\r\nexchequer, Harley, soon afterwards Earl of Oxford, and the secretary of\r\nstate, St. John, who became Lord Bolingbroke, were inclined to peace.\r\nAdvances were made to France.  A French priest, Abbe Gautier, living in\r\nobscurity in England, arrived in Paris during January, 1711; he went to\r\nsee M. de Torcy at Versailles.  “Do you want peace?”  said he.  “I have\r\ncome to bring you the means of treating for it, and concluding\r\nindependently of the Hollanders, unworthy of the king’s kindnesses and of\r\nthe honor he has so often done them of applying to them to pacificate\r\nEurope.”  “To ask just then one of his Majesty’s ministers if he desired\r\npeace,” says Torcy, “was to ask a sick man suffering from a long and\r\ndangerous disease if he wants to be cured.”  Negotiations were secretly\r\nopened with the English cabinet.  The Emperor Joseph had just died (April\r\n17, 1711).  He left none but daughters.  From that moment Archduke\r\nCharles inherited the domains of the house of Austria, and aspired to the\r\nimperial crown; by giving him Spain, Europe re-established the monarchy\r\nof Charles V.; she saw the dangers into which she was being drawn by the\r\nresentments or short-sighted ambition of the triumvirate; she fell back\r\nupon the wise projects of William III.  Holland had abandoned them; to\r\nEngland fell the honor of making them triumphant.  She has often made war\r\nupon the Continent with indomitable obstinacy and perseverance; but at\r\nbottom and by the very force of circumstances England remains, as regards\r\nthe affairs of Europe, an essentially pacific power.  War brings her no\r\nadvantage; she cannot pretend to any territorial aggrandizement in\r\nEurope; it is the equilibrium between the continental powers that makes\r\nher strength, and her first interest was always to maintain it.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1711 was everywhere insignificant.  Negotiations were\r\nstill going on with England, secretly and through subordinate agents:\r\nManager, member of the Board of Trade, for France; and, for England, the\r\npoet Prior, strongly attached to Harley.  On the 29th of January, 1712,\r\nthe general conferences were opened at Utrecht.  The French had been\r\nanxious to avoid the Hague, dreading the obstinacy of Heinsius in favor\r\nof his former proposals.  Preliminary points were already settled with\r\nEngland; enormous advantages were secured in America to English commerce,\r\nto which was ceded Newfoundland and all that France still possessed in\r\nAcadia; the general proposals had been accepted by Queen Anne and her\r\nministers.  In vain had the Hollanders and Prince Eugene made great\r\nefforts to modify them; St. John had dryly remarked that England had\r\nborne the greatest part in the burden of the war, and it was but just\r\nthat she should direct the negotiations for peace.  For five years past\r\nthe United Provinces, exhausted by the length of hostilities, had\r\nconstantly been defaulters in their engagements; it was proved to Prince\r\nEugene that the imperial army had not been increased by two regiments in\r\nconsequence of the war the emperor’s ambassador, M. de Galas, displayed\r\nimpertinence: he was forbidden to come to the court; in spite of the\r\nreserve imposed upon the English ministers by the strife of parties in a\r\nfree country, their desire for peace was evident.  The queen had just\r\nordered the creation of new peers in order to secure a majority of the\r\nupper house in favor of a pacific policy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Grand Dauphin----505]\r\n\r\nThe bolts of Heaven were falling one after another upon the royal family\r\nof France.  On the 14th of April, 1711, Louis XIV. had lost by small-pox\r\nhis son, the grand dauphin, a mediocre and submissive creature, ever the\r\nmost humble subject of the king, at just fifty years of age.  His eldest\r\nson, the Duke of Burgundy, devout, austere, and capable, the hope of good\r\nmen and the terror of intriguers, had taken the rank of dauphin, and was\r\nseriously commencing his apprenticeship in government, when he was\r\ncarried off on the 18th of February, 1712, by spotted fever (_rougeole\r\npourpree_), six days after his wife, the charming Mary Adelaide of Savoy,\r\nthe idol of the whole court, supremely beloved by the king, and by Madame\r\nde Maintenon, who had brought her up; their son, the Duke of Brittany,\r\nfour years old, died on the 8th of March; a child in the cradle, weakly\r\nand ill, the little Duke of Anjou, remained the only shoot of the elder\r\nbranch of the Bourbons.  Dismay seized upon all France; poison was spoken\r\nof; the Duke of Orleans was accused; it was necessary to have a post\r\nmortem examination; only the hand of God had left its traces.  Europe in\r\nits turn was excited.  If the little Duke of Anjou were to die, the crown\r\nof France reverted to Philip V.  The Hollanders and the ambassadors of\r\nthe Emperor Charles VI. recently crowned at Frankfurt, insisted on the\r\nnecessity of a formal renunciation.  In accord with the English\r\nministers, Louis XIV. wrote to his grandson,--\r\n\r\n“You will be told what England proposes, that you should renounce your\r\nbirthright, retaining the monarchy of Spain and the Indies, or renounce\r\nthe monarchy of Spain, retaining your rights to the succession in France,\r\nand receiving in exchange for the crown of Spain the kingdoms of Sicily\r\nand Naples, the states of the Duke of Savoy, Montferrat, and the Mantuan,\r\nthe said Duke of Savoy succeeding you in Spain; I confess to you that,\r\nnotwithstanding the disproportion in the dominions, I have been sensibly\r\naffected by the thought that you would continue to reign, that I might\r\nstill regard you as my successor, sure, if the dauphin lives, of a regent\r\naccustomed to command, capable of maintaining order in my kingdom and\r\nstifling its cabals.  If this child were to die, as his weakly complexion\r\ngives too much reason to suppose, you would enjoy the succession to me\r\nfollowing the order of your birth, and I should have the consolation of\r\nleaving to my people a virtuous king, capable of commanding them, and one\r\nwho, on succeeding me, would unite to the crown states so considerable as\r\nNaples, Savoy, Piedmont, and Montferrat.  If gratitude and affection\r\ntowards your subjects are to you pressing reasons for remaining with\r\nthem, I may say that you owe me the same sentiments; you owe them to your\r\nown house, to your own country, before Spain.  All that I can do for you\r\nis to leave you once more the choice, the necessity for concluding peace\r\nbecoming every day more urgent.”\r\n\r\nThe choice of Philip V. was made; he had already written to his\r\ngrandfather to say that he would renounce all his rights of succession\r\nto the throne of France rather than give up the crown of Spain.  This\r\ndecision was solemnly enregistered by the Cortes.  The English required\r\nthat the Dukes of Berry and Orleans should, likewise make renunciation of\r\ntheir rights to the crown of Spain.  Negotiations began again, but war\r\nbegan again at the same time as the negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe king had given Villars the command of the army of Flanders.  The\r\nmarshal went to Marly to receive his last orders.  “You see my plight,\r\nmarshal,” said Louis XIV.  “There are few examples of what is my fate--to\r\nlose in the same week a grandson, a grandson’s wife and their son, all of\r\nvery great promise and very tenderly beloved.  God is punishing me; I\r\nhave well deserved it.  But suspend we my griefs at my own domestic woes,\r\nand look we to what may be done to prevent those of the kingdom.  If\r\nanything were to happen to the army you command, what would be your idea\r\nof the course I should adopt as regards my person?”  The marshal\r\nhesitated.  The king resumed: “This is what I think; you shall tell me\r\nyour opinion afterwards.  I know the courtiers’ line of argument; they\r\nnearly all wish me to retire to Blois, and not wait for the enemy’s army\r\nto approach Paris, as it might do if mine were beaten.  For my part, I am\r\naware that armies so considerable are never defeated to such an extent as\r\nto prevent the greater part of mine from retiring upon the Somme.  I know\r\nthat river; it is very difficult to cross; there are forts, too, which\r\ncould be made strong.  I should count upon getting to Peronne or St.\r\nQuentin, and there massing all the troops I had, making a last effort\r\nwith you, and falling together or saving the kingdom; I will never\r\nconsent to let the enemy approach my capital.  [_Memoires de Villars,\r\nt. ii.  p. 362.]”\r\n\r\nGod was to spare Louis XIV. that crowning disaster reserved for other\r\ntimes; in spite of all his defaults and the culpable errors of his life\r\nand reign, Providence had given this old man, overwhelmed by so many\r\nreverses and sorrows, a truly royal soul, and that regard for his own\r\ngreatness which set him higher as a king than he would have been as a\r\nman.  “He had too proud a soul to descend lower than his misfortunes had\r\nbrought him,” says Montesquieu, “and he well knew that courage may right\r\na crown and that infamy never does.”  On the 25th of May, the king\r\nsecretly informed his plenipotentiaries as well as his generals that the\r\nEnglish were proposing to him a suspension of hostilities; and he added,\r\n“It is no longer a time for flattering the pride of the Hollanders, but,\r\nwhilst we treat with them in good faith, it must be with the dignity that\r\nbecomes me.”  “A style different from that of the conferences at the\r\nHague and Gertruydenberg,” is the remark made by M. de Torcy.  That which\r\nthe king’s pride refused to the ill will of the Hollanders he granted to\r\nthe good will of England.  The day of the commencement of the armistice\r\nDunkerque was put as guarantee into the hands of the English, who\r\nrecalled their native regiments from the army of Prince Eugene; the king\r\ncomplained that they left him the auxiliary troops; the English ministers\r\nproposed to prolong the truce, promising to treat separately with France\r\nif the allies refused assent to the peace.  The news received by Louis\r\nXIV. gave him assurance of better conditions than any one had dared to\r\nhope for.\r\n\r\nVillars had not been able to prevent Prince Eugene from becoming master\r\nof Quesnoy on the 3d of July; the imperialists were already making\r\npreparations to invade France; in their army the causeway which connected\r\nMarchiennes with Landrecies was called the Paris road.  The marshal\r\nresolved to relieve Landrecies, and, having had bridges thrown over the\r\nScheldt, he, on the 23d of July, 1712, crossed the river between Bouchain\r\nand Denain; the latter little place was defended by the Duke of\r\nAlbemarle, son of General Monk, with seventeen battalions of auxiliary\r\ntroops in the pay of the allies; Lieutenant General Albergotti, an\r\nexperienced soldier, considered the undertaking perilous.  “Go and lie\r\ndown for an hour or two, M. d’Albergotti,” said Villars; “to-morrow by\r\nthree in the morning you shall know whether the enemy’s intrenchments are\r\nas strong as you suppose.”  Prince Eugene was coming up by forced marches\r\nto relieve Denain, by falling on the rearguard of the French army.  It\r\nwas proposed to Villars to make fascines to fill up the fosses of Denain.\r\n“Do you suppose,” said he, pointing to the enemy’s army in the distance,\r\n“that those gentry will give us the time?  Our fascines shall be the\r\nbodies of the first of our men who fall in the fosse.”\r\n\r\n“There was not an instant, not a minute to lose,” says the marshal in his\r\nMemoires.  “I made my infantry march on four lines in the most beautiful\r\norder; as I entered the intrenchment at the head of the troops, I had not\r\ngone twenty paces when the Duke of Albemarle and six or seven of the\r\nemperor’s lieutenant generals were at my horse’s feet.  I begged them to\r\nexcuse me if present matters did not permit me to show them all the\r\npoliteness I ought, but that the first of all was to provide for the\r\nsafety of their persons.”  The enemy thought of nothing but flight; the\r\nbridges over the Scheldt broke down under the multitude of vehicles and\r\nhorses; nearly all the defenders of Denain were taken or killed.  Prince\r\nEugene could not cross the river, watched as it was by French troops; he\r\ndid not succeed in saving Marchiennes, which the Count of Broglie, had\r\nbeen ordered to invest in the very middle of the action in front of\r\nDenain; the imperialists raised the siege of Landrecies, but without\r\ndaring to attack Villars, re-enforced by a few garrisons; the marshal\r\nimmediately invested Douai; on the 27th of August, the emperor’s troops\r\nwho were defending one of the forts demanded a capitulation; the officers\r\nwho went out asked for a delay of four days, so as to receive orders from\r\nPrince Eugene; the marshal, who was in the trenches, called his\r\ngrenadiers.  “This is my council on such occasions,” said he to the\r\nastonished imperialists.  “My friends, these captains demand four days’\r\ntime to receive orders from their general; what do you think?”  “Leave it\r\nto us, marshal,” replied the grenadiers; “in a quarter of an hour we will\r\nslit their windpipes.”  “Gentlemen,” said I to the officers, “they will\r\ndo as they have said; so take your own course.”  The garrison surrendered\r\nat discretion.  Douai capitulated on the 8th of September; Le Quesnoy was\r\ntaken on the 4th of October, and Bouchain on the 18th; Prince Eugene had\r\nnot been able to attempt anything; he fell back under the walls of\r\nBrussels.  On the Rhine, on the Alps, in Spain, the French and Spanish\r\narmies had held the enemy in check.  The French plenipotentiaries at\r\nUtrecht had recovered their courage.  “We put on the face the Hollanders\r\nhad at Gertruydenberg, and they put on ours,” wrote Cardinal de Polignac\r\nfrom Utrecht: “it is a complete turning of the tables.”  “Gentlemen,\r\npeace will be treated for amongst you, for you and without you,” was the\r\nremark made to the Hollanders.  Hereditary adversary of the Van Witts and\r\ntheir party, Heinsius had pursued the policy of William III. without the\r\nforesight and lofty views of William Ill.; he had not seen his way in\r\n1709 to shaking off the yoke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene in order to\r\ntake the initiative in a peace necessary for Europe; in 1712 he submitted\r\nto the will of Harley and St. John, thus losing the advantages of the\r\npowerful mediatorial position which the United Provinces had owed to the\r\neminent men successively intrusted with their government.  Henceforth\r\nHolland remained a free and prosperous country, respected and worthy of\r\nher independence, but her political influence and importance in Europe\r\nwere at an end.  Under God’s hand great men make great destinies and\r\ngreat positions for their country as well as for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Denain and its happy consequences hastened the conclusion\r\nof the negotiations; the German princes themselves began to split up;\r\nthe King of Prussia, Frederic William I., who had recently succeeded his\r\nfather, was the first to escape from the emperor’s yoke.  Lord\r\nBolingbroke put the finishing stroke at Versailles to the conditions of a\r\ngeneral peace; the month of April was the extreme limit fixed by England\r\nfor her allies; on the 11th peace was signed between France, England, the\r\nUnited Provinces, Portugal, the King of Prussia, and the Duke of Savoy.\r\nLouis XIV. recovered Lijle, Aire, Bethune, and St. Venant; he\r\nstrengthened with a few places the barrier of the Hollanders; he likewise\r\ngranted to the Duke of Savoy a barrier on the Italian slope of the Alps;\r\nhe recognized Queen Anne, at the same time exiling from France the\r\nPretender James III., whom he had but lately proclaimed with so much\r\nflourish of trumpets, and he razed the fortifications of Dunkerque.\r\nEngland kept Gibraltar and Minorca; Sicily was assigned to the Duke of\r\nSavoy.  France recognized the King of Prussia.  The peace was an\r\nhonorable and an unexpected one, after so many disasters the King of\r\nSpain held out for some time; he wanted to set up an independent\r\nprincipality for the Princess des Ursins, _camerera mayor_ to the queen\r\nhis wife, an able, courageous, and clever intriguer, all-powerful at\r\ncourt, who had done good service to the interests of France; he could not\r\nobtain any dismemberment of the United Provinces; and at last Philip V.\r\nin his turn signed.  The emperor and the empire alone remained aloof from\r\nthe general peace.  War recommenced in Germany and on the Rhine.  Villars\r\ncarried Spires and Kaiserlautern.  He laid siege to Landau.  His\r\nlieutenants were uneasy.  “Gentlemen,” said Villars, “I have heard the\r\nPrince of Conde say that the enemy should be feared at a distance and\r\ndespised at close quarters.”  Landau capitulated on the 20th of August;\r\non the 30th of September Villars entered Friburg; the citadel surrendered\r\non the 13th of November; the imperialists began to make pacific\r\novertures; the two generals, Villars and Prince Eugene, were charged with\r\nthe negotiations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marshal Villars and Prince Eugene----512]\r\n\r\n“I arrived at Rastadt on the 26th of November in the afternoon,” writes\r\nVillars in his Memoires, “and the Prince of Savoy half an hour after me.\r\nThe moment I knew he was in the court-yard, I went to the top of the\r\nsteps to meet him, apologizing to him on the ground that a lame man could\r\nnot go down; we embraced with the feelings of an old and true friendship\r\nwhich long wars and various engagements had not altered.”  The two\r\nplenipotentiaries were headstrong in their discussions.  “If we begin war\r\nagain,” said Villars, “where will you find money?”  “It is true that we\r\nhaven’t any,” rejoined the prince; “but there is still some in the\r\nempire.”  “Poor states of the empire!” I exclaimed; “your advice is not\r\nasked about beginning the dance; yet you must of course follow the\r\nleaders.”  Peace was at last signed on the 6th of March, 1714: France\r\nkept Landau and Fort Louis; she restored Spires, Brisach, and Friburg.\r\nThe emperor refused to recognize Philip V., but he accepted the status\r\nquo; the crown of Spain remained definitively with the house of Bourbon;\r\nit had cost men and millions enough; for an instant the very foundations\r\nof order in Europe had seemed to be upset; the old French monarchy had\r\nbeen threatened; it had recovered of itself and by its own resources,\r\nsustaining single-handed the struggle which was pulling down all Europe\r\nin coalition against it; it had obtained conditions which restored its\r\nfrontiers to the limits of the peace of Ryswick; but it was exhausted,\r\ngasping, at wits’ end for men and money; absolute power had obtained from\r\nnational pride the last possible efforts, but it had played itself out in\r\nthe struggle; the confidence of the country was shaken; it had been seen\r\nwhat dangers the will of a single man had made the nation incur; the\r\ntempest was already gathering within men’s souls.  The habit of respect,\r\nthe memory of past glories, the personal majesty of Louis XIV. still kept\r\nup about the aged king the deceitful appearances of uncontested power and\r\nsovereign authority; the long decadence of his great-grandson’s reign was\r\ndestined to complete its ruin.\r\n\r\n“I loved war too much,” was Louis XIV.’s confession on his death bed.\r\nHe had loved it madly and exclusively; but this fatal passion, which had\r\nruined and corrupted France, had not at any rate remained infructuous.\r\nLouis XIV. had the good fortune to profit by the efforts of his\r\npredecessors as well as of his own servants: Richelieu and Mazarin, Conde\r\nand Turenne, Luxembourg, Catinat, Vauban, Villars, and Louvois, all\r\ntoiled at the same work; under his reign France was intoxicated with\r\nexcess of the pride of conquest, but she did not lose all its fruits; she\r\nwitnessed the conclusion of five peaces, mostly glorious, the last sadly\r\nhonorable; all tended to consolidate the unity and power of the kingdom;\r\nit is to the treaties of the Pyrenees, of Westphalia, of Nimeguen, of\r\nRyswick, and of Utrecht, all signed with the name of Louis XIV., that\r\nFrance owed Roussillon, Artois, Alsace, Flanders, and Franche-Comte.  Her\r\nglory has more than once cost her dear; it has never been worth so much\r\nand such solid increment to her territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.----LOUIS XIV. AND HOME ADMINISTRATION.\r\n\r\nIt is King Louis XIV.’s distinction and heavy, burden in the eyes of\r\nhistory that it is, impossible to tell of anything in his reign without\r\nconstantly recurring to himself.  He had two ministers of the higher\r\norder, Colbert and Louvois; several of good capacity, such as Seignelay\r\nand Torcy; others incompetent, like Chamillard; he remained as much\r\nmaster of the administrators of the first rank as if they had been\r\ninsignificant clerks; the home government of France, from 1661 to 1715,\r\nis summed up in the king’s relations with his ministers.\r\n\r\n“I resolved from the first not to have any premier minister,” says Louis\r\nXIV. in his Memoires, “and not to leave to another the functions of king\r\nwhilst I had nothing but the title.  But, on the contrary, I made up my\r\nmind to share the execution of my orders amongst several persons, in\r\norder to concentrate their authority in my own alone.  I might have cast\r\nmy eyes upon people of higher consideration than those I selected, but\r\nthey seemed to me competent to execute, under me, the matters with which\r\nI purposed to intrust them.  I did not think it was to my interest to\r\nlook for men of higher standing, because, as I wanted above all things to\r\nestablish my own reputation, it was important that the public should\r\nknow, from the rank of those of whom I made use, that I had no intention\r\nof sharing my authority with them, and that they themselves, knowing what\r\nthey were, should not conceive higher hopes than I wished to give them.”\r\n\r\nIt has been said already that the court governed France in the reign of\r\nLouis XIV.; and what was, in fact, the court?  The men who lived about\r\nthe king, depending on, his favor, the source or arbiter of their\r\nfortunes.  The great lords served in the army, with lustre, when they\r\nbore the name of Conde, Turenne, or Luxembourg; but they never had any\r\nplace amongst the king’s confidential servants.  “Luck, in spite of us,\r\nhas as much to do as wisdom--and more--with the choice of our ministers,”\r\n he says in his Memoires, “and, in respect of what wisdom may have to do\r\ntherewith, genius is far more effectual than counsel.”  It was their\r\ngenius which made the fortunes and the power of Louis XIV.’s two great\r\nministers, Colbert and Louvois.\r\n\r\nIn advance, and on the faith of Cardinal Mazarin, the king knew the worth\r\nof Colbert.  “I had all possible confidence in him,” says he, “because I\r\nknew that he had a great deal of application, intelligence, and probity.”\r\n Rough, reserved, taciturn, indefatigable in work, passionately devoted to\r\nthe cause of order, public welfare, and the peaceable aggrandizement of\r\nFrance, Colbert, on becoming the comptroller of finance in 1661, brought\r\nto the service of the state superior views, consummate experience, and\r\nindomitable perseverance.  The position of affairs required no fewer\r\nvirtues.  “Disorder reigned everywhere,” says the king; “on casting over\r\nthe various portions of my kingdom not eyes of indifference, but the eyes\r\nof a master, I was sensibly affected not to see a single one which did\r\nnot deserve and did not press to be taken in hand.  The destitution of\r\nthe lower orders was extreme, and the finances, which give movement and\r\nactivity to all this great framework of the monarchy, were entirely\r\nexhausted and in such plight that there was scarcely any resource to be\r\nseen; the affluent, to be seen only amongst official people, on the one\r\nhand cloaked all their malversations by divers kinds of artifices, and\r\nuncloaked them on the other by their insolent and audacious extravagance,\r\nas if they were afraid to leave me in ignorance of them.”\r\n\r\nThe punishment of the tax-collectors (_traitants_), prosecuted at the\r\nsame time as superintendent Fouquet, the arbitrary redemption of rentes\r\n(_annuities_) on the city of Paris or on certain branches of the taxes,\r\ndid not suffice to alleviate the extreme suffering of the people.  The\r\ntalliages from which the nobility and the clergy were nearly everywhere\r\nexempt pressed upon the people with the most cruel inequality.  “The poor\r\nare reduced to eating grass and roots in our meadows like cattle,” said a\r\nletter from Blaisois those who can find dead carcasses devour them, and,\r\nunless God have pity upon them, they will soon be eating one another.”\r\n Normandy, generally so prosperous, was reduced to the uttermost distress.\r\n“The great number of poor has exhausted charity and the power of those\r\nwho were accustomed to relieve them,” says a letter to Colbert from the\r\nsuperintendent of Caen.  “In 1662 the town was obliged to throw open the\r\ndoors of the great hospital, having no longer any means of furnishing\r\nsubsistence to those who were in it.  I can assure you that there are\r\npersons in this town who have gone for whole days without anything to\r\neat.  The country, which ought to supply bread for the towns, is crying\r\nfor mercy’s sake to be supplied therewith itself.”  The peasants, wasted\r\nwith hunger, could no longer till their fields; their cattle had been\r\nseized for taxes.  Colbert proposed to the king to remit the arrears of\r\ntalliages, and devoted all his efforts to reducing them, whilst\r\nregulating their collection.  His desire was to arrive at the\r\nestablishment everywhere of real talliages, on landed property, &c.,\r\ninstead of personal talliages, variable imposts, depending upon the\r\nsupposed means or social position of the inhabitants.  He was only very\r\npartially successful, without, however, allowing himself to be repelled\r\nby the difficulties presented by differences of legislation and customs\r\nin the provinces.  “Perhaps,” he wrote to the superintendent of Aix, in\r\n1681, “on getting to the bottom of the matter and considering it in\r\ndetail, you will not discover in it all the impossibilities you have\r\npictured to yourself.”  Colbert died without having completed his work;\r\nthe talliages, however, had been reduced by eight millions of livres\r\nwithin the first two years of his administration.  “All the imposts of\r\nthe kingdom,” he writes, in 1662, to the superintendent of Tours, who is\r\ncomplaining of the destitution of the people, “are, as regards the\r\ntalliages, but about thirty-seven millions, and, for forty or fifty years\r\npast, they have always been between forty and fifty millions, except\r\nafter the peace, when his Majesty reduced them to thirty-two,\r\nthirty-three, and thirty-four millions.”\r\n\r\nPeace was of short duration in the reign of Louis XIV., and often so\r\nprecarious that it did not permit of disarmament.  At the very period\r\nwhen the able minister was trying to make the people feel the importance\r\nof the diminution in the talliages, he wrote to the king, “I entreat your\r\nMajesty to read these few lines attentively.  I confess to your Majesty\r\nthat the last time you were graciously pleased to speak to me about the\r\nstate of the finances, my respect, the boundless desire I have always had\r\nto please you and serve you to your satisfaction, without making any\r\ndifficulty or causing any hitch, and still more your natural eloquence\r\nwhich succeeds in bringing conviction of whatever you please, deprived me\r\nof courage to insist and dwell somewhat upon the condition of your\r\nfinances, for the which I see no other remedy but increase of receipts\r\nand decrease of expenses; wherefore, though this is no concern at all of\r\nmine, I merely entreat your Majesty to permit me to say that in war as\r\nwell as in peace you have never consulted your finances for the purpose\r\nof determining your expenditure, which is a thing so extraordinary that\r\nassuredly there is no example thereof.  For the past twenty years during\r\nwhich I have had the honor of serving your Majesty, though the receipts\r\nhave greatly increased, you would find that the expenses have much\r\nexceeded the receipts, which might perhaps induce you to moderate and\r\nretrench such as are excessive.  I am aware, Sir, that the figure I\r\npresent herein is not an agreeable one; but in your Majesty’s service\r\nthere are different functions; some entail nothing but agreeables whereof\r\nthe expenses are the foundation; that with which your Majesty honors me\r\nentails this misfortune, that it can with difficulty produce anything\r\nagreeable, since the proposals for expenses have no limit; but one must\r\nconsole one’s self by constantly laboring to do one’s best.”\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. did not “moderate or retrench his expenses.”\r\n\r\nColbert labored to increase the receipts; the new imposts excited\r\ninsurrections in Angoumois, in Guyenne, in Brittany.  Bordeaux rose in\r\n1695 with shouts of “_Hurrah! for the king without gabel_.”  Marshal\r\nd’Albret ventured into the streets in the district of St. Michel; he was\r\naccosted by one of the ringleaders.  “Well, my friend,” said the marshal,\r\n“with whom is thy business?  Dost wish to speak to me?”  “Yes,” replied\r\nthe townsman, “I am deputed by the people of St. Michel to tell you that\r\nthey are good servants of the king, but that they do not mean to have any\r\ngabel, or marks on pewter or tobacco, or stamped papers, or _yreffe\r\nd’arbitrage_ (arbitration-clerk’s fee).”  It was not until a year\r\nafterwards that the taxes could be established in Gascony; troops had to\r\nbe sent to Rennes to impose the stamp-tax upon the Bretons.  “Soldiers\r\nare more likely to be wanted in Lower Brittany than in any other spot,”\r\n said a letter to Colbert from the lieutenant general, M. de Lavardin; “it\r\nis a rough and wild country, which breeds inhabitants who resemble it.\r\nThey understand French but slightly, and reason not much better.  The\r\nParliament is at the back of all this.”  Riots were frequent, and were\r\nput down with great severity.  “The poor Low-Bretons collect by forty or\r\nfifty in the fields,” writes Madame de Sevigne on the 24th of September,\r\n1675: “as soon as they see soldiers, they throw themselves on their\r\nknees, saying, Mea culpa! all the French they know..  .  .”\r\n\r\n“The severities are abating,” she adds on the 3d of November: “after the\r\nhangings there will be no more hanging.”  All these fresh imposts, which\r\nhad cost so much suffering and severity, brought in but two millions five\r\nhundred thousand livres at Colbert’s death.  The indirect taxes, which\r\nwere at that time called _fermes generales_ (farmings-general), amounted\r\nto thirty-seven millions during the first two years of Colbert’s\r\nadministration, and rose to sixty-four millions at the time of his death.\r\n“I should be apprehensive of going too far, and that the prodigious\r\naugmentations of the _fermes_ (farmings) would be very burdensome to the\r\npeople,” wrote Louis XIV. in 1680.  The expenses of recovering the taxes,\r\nwhich had but lately led to great abuses, were diminished by half.  “The\r\nbailiffs generally, and especially those who are set over the recovery of\r\ntalliages, are such terrible brutes that, by way of exterminating a good\r\nnumber of these, you could not do anything more worthy of you than\r\nsuppress those,” wrote Colbert to the criminal magistrate of Orleans.\r\n“I am at this moment promoting two suits against the collectors of\r\ntalliages, in which I expect at present to get ten thousand crowns’\r\ndamages, without counting another against an assessor’s officer, who\r\nwounded one Grimault, the which had one of his daughters killed before\r\nhis eyes, his wife, another of his daughters, and his female servant\r\nwounded with swords and sticks, the writ of distrainment being executed\r\nwhilst the poor creature was being buried.”  The bailiffs were\r\nsuppressed, and the king’s justice was let loose not only against the\r\nfiscal officers who abused their power, but also against tyrannical\r\nnobles.  Masters of requests and members of the Parliament of Paris went\r\nto Auvergne and Velay and held temporary courts of justice, which were\r\ncalled _grands jours_.  Several lords were found guilty; Sieur de la\r\nMothe actually died upon the scaffold for having unjustly despoiled and\r\nmaltreated the people on his estates.  “He was not one of the worst,”\r\n says Flechier, in his _Journal des Grands Jours d’Auvergne_.  The Duke of\r\nBouillon, governor of the province, had too long favored the guilty.\r\n“I resolved,” says the king in his _Memoires,_ “to prevent the people\r\nfrom being subjected to thousands and thousands of tyrants, instead of\r\none lawful king, whose indulgence alone it is that causes all this\r\ndisorder.”  The puissance of the provincial governors, already curtailed\r\nby Richelieu, suffered from fresh attacks under Louis XIV.  Everywhere\r\nthe power passed into the hands of the superintendents, themselves\r\nsubjected in their turn to inspection by the masters of requests.\r\n“Acting on the information I had that in many provinces the people were\r\nplagued by certain folks who abused their title of governors in order to\r\nmake unjust requisitions,” says the king in his _Memoires,_ “I posted men\r\nin all quarters for the express purpose of keeping myself more surely\r\ninformed of such exactions, in order to punish them as they deserved.”\r\n Order was restored in all parts of France.  “The _Auvergnats,_” said a\r\nletter to Colbert from President de Novion, “never knew so certainly that\r\nthey had a king as they do now.”\r\n\r\n“A useless banquet at a cost of a thousand crowns causes me incredible\r\npain,” said Colbert to Louis XIV.,  and yet, when it is a question of\r\nmillions of gold for Poland, I would sell all my property, I would pawn\r\nmy wife and children, and I would go afoot all my life to provide for it\r\nif necessary.  Your Majesty, if it please you, will forgive me this\r\nlittle transport.  I begin to doubt whether the liberty I take is\r\nagreeable to your Majesty; it has seemed to me that you were beginning to\r\nprefer your pleasures and your diversions to everything else; at the very\r\ntime when your Majesty told me at St. Germain that the morsel must be\r\ntaken from one’s mouth to provide for the increment of the naval\r\narmament, you spent two hundred thousand livres down for a trip to\r\nVersailles, to wit, thirteen thousand pistoles for your gambling expenses\r\nand the queen’s, and fifty thousand livres for extraordinary banquets;\r\nyou have likewise so intermingled our diversions, with the war on land\r\nthat it is difficult to separate the two, and, if your Majesty will be\r\ngraciously pleased to examine in detail the amount of useless expenditure\r\nyou have incurred, you will plainly see that, if it were all deducted,\r\nyou would not be reduced to your present necessity.  The right thing to\r\ndo, sir, is to grudge five sous for unnecessary things, and to throw\r\nmillions about when it is for your glory.”\r\n\r\nColbert knew, in fact, how to “throw millions about” when it was for\r\nendowing France with new manufactures and industries.  “One of the most\r\nimportant works of peace,” he used to say, “is the re-establishment of\r\nevery kind of trade in this kingdom, and to put it in a position to do\r\nwithout having recourse to foreigners for the things necessary for the\r\nuse and comfort of the subjects.”  “We have no need of anybody, and our\r\nneighbors have need of us;” such was the maxim laid down in a document\r\nof that date, which has often been attributed to Colbert, and which he\r\ncertainly put incessantly into practice.  The cloth manufactures were\r\ndying out, they received encouragement; a Protestant Hollander, Van\r\nRobais, attracted over to Abbeville by Colbert, there introduced the\r\nmaking of fine cloths; at Beauvais and in the Gobelins establishment at\r\nParis, under the direction of the great painter Lebrun, the French\r\ntapestries soon threw into the shade the reputation of the tapestries of\r\nFlanders; Venice had to yield up her secrets and her workmen for the\r\nglass manufactories of St. Gobain and Tourlaville.  The great lords and\r\nladies were obliged to give up the Venetian point with which their\r\ndresses had been trimmed; the importation of it was forbidden, and lace\r\nmanufactories were everywhere established in France; there was even a\r\nstrike amongst the women at Alencon against the new lace which it was\r\ndesired to force them to make.  “There are more than eighty thousand\r\npersons working at lace in Alencon, Seez, Argentan, Falaise, and the\r\ncircumjacent parishes,” said a letter to Colbert from the superintendent\r\nof Alencon, “and I can assure you, my lord, that it is manna and a\r\nblessing from heaven over all this district, where even little children\r\nof seven years of age find means of earning a livelihood; the little\r\nshepherd-girls from the fields work, like the rest, at it; they say that\r\nthey will never be able to make such fine point as this, and that one\r\nwants to take away their bread and their means of paying their talliage.”\r\n Point d’Alencon won the battle, and the making of lace spread all over\r\nNormandy.  Manufactures of soap, tin, arms, silk, gave work to a\r\nmultitude of laborers; the home trade of France at the same time received\r\ndevelopment; the bad state of the roads was “a dreadful hinderance to\r\ntraffic;” Colbert ordered them to be every where improved.  “The\r\nsuperintendents have done wonders, and we are never tired of singing\r\ntheir praises,” writes, Madame de Sevigne to her daughter during one of\r\nher trips; “it is quite extraordinary what beautiful roads there are;\r\nthere is not a single moment’s stoppage; there are malls and walks\r\neverywhere.”  The magnificent canal of Languedoc, due to the generous\r\ninitiative of Riquet, united the Ocean to the Mediterranean; the canal of\r\nOrleans completed the canal of Briare, commenced by Henry IV.  The inland\r\ncustom-houses which shackled the traffic between province and province\r\nwere suppressed at divers points; many provinces demurred to the\r\nadmission of this innovation, declaring that, to set their affairs right,\r\n“there was need of nothing but order, order, order.”  Colbert also wanted\r\norder, but his views were higher and broader than those of Breton or\r\nGascon merchants; in spite of his desire to “put the kingdom in a\r\nposition to do without having recourse to foreigners for things necessary\r\nfor the use and comfort of the French,” he had too lofty and too\r\njudicious a mind to neglect the extension of trade; like Richelieu, he\r\nwas for founding great trading companies; he had five, for the East and\r\nWest Indies, the Levant, the North, and Africa; just as with Richelieu,\r\nthey were with difficulty established, and lasted but a little while;\r\nit was necessary to levy subscriptions on the members of the sovereign\r\ncorporations; “M. de Bercy put down his name for a thousand livres,” says\r\nthe journal of Oliver d’Ormesson.  “M. de Colbert laughed at him, and\r\nsaid that it could not be for his pocket’s sake; and the end of it was,\r\nthat he put down three thousand livres.”  Colbert could not get over the\r\nmortifying success of the company of the Dutch Indies.  “I cannot believe\r\nthat they pay forty per cent.,” said he.  It was with the Dutch that he\r\nmost frequently had commercial difficulties.  The United Provinces\r\nproduced but little, and their merchant navy was exclusively engaged in\r\nthe business of transport; the charge of fifty sous per ton on\r\nmerchandise carried in foreign vessels caused so much ill humor amongst\r\nthe Hollanders that it was partly the origin of their rupture with France\r\nand of the treaty of the Triple Alliance.  Colbert made great efforts to\r\ndevelop the French navy, both the fighting and the merchant.  “The\r\nsea-traffic of all the world,” he wrote in 1669 to M. de Pomponne, then\r\nambassador to Holland, “is done with twenty thousand vessels or\r\nthereabouts.  In the natural order of things, each nation should have its\r\nown share thereof in proportion to its power, population, and seaboard.\r\nThe Hollanders have fifteen or sixteen thousand out of this number, and\r\nthe French perhaps four or five hundred at most.  The king is employing\r\nall sorts of means which he thinks useful in order to approach a little\r\nmore nearly to the number his subjects ought naturally to have.”\r\n Colbert’s efforts were not useless; at his death, the maritime trade of\r\nFrance had developed itself, and French merchants were effectually\r\nprotected at sea by ships of war.  “It is necessary,” said Colbert in his\r\ninstructions to Seignelay, “that my son should be as keenly alive to all\r\nthe disorders that may occur in trade, and all the losses that may be\r\nincurred by every trader, as if they were his own.”  In 1692 the royal\r\nnavy numbered a hundred and eighty-six vessels; a hundred and sixty\r\nthousand sailors were down on the books; the works at the ports of\r\nToulon, Brest, and Rochefort were in full activity; Louis XIV. was in a\r\nposition to refuse the salute of the flag which the English had up to\r\nthat time exacted in the Channel from all nations.  “The king my brother\r\nand those of whom he takes counsel do not quite know me yet,” wrote the\r\nking to his ambassador in London, “when they adopt towards me a tone of\r\nhaughtiness and a certain sturdiness which has a savor of menace.  I know\r\nof no power under heaven that can make me move a step by that sort of\r\nway; evil may come to me, of course, but no sensation of fear.  The King\r\nof England and his chancellor may, of course, see pretty well what my\r\nstrength is, but they do not see my heart; I, who feel and know full well\r\nboth one and the other, desire that, for sole reply to so haughty a\r\ndeclaration, they learn from your mouth that I neither seek nor ask for\r\nany accommodation in the matter of the flag, because I shall know quite\r\nwell how to maintain my right whatever may happen.  I intend before long\r\nto place my maritime forces on such a footing that the English shall\r\nconsider it a favor if it be my good pleasure then to listen to\r\nmodifications touching a right which is due to me more legitimately than\r\nto them.”  Duquesne and Tourville, Duguay-Trouin and John Bart, permitted\r\nthe king to make good on the seas such proud words.  From 1685 to 1712\r\nthe French fleets could everywhere hold their own against the allied\r\nsquadrons of England and Holland.\r\n\r\nSo many and such sustained efforts in all directions, so many vast\r\nprojects and of so great promise, suited the mind of Louis XIV. as well\r\nas that of his minister.  “I tell you what I think,” wrote Louis XIV. to\r\nColbert in 1674; “but, after all, I end as I began, by placing myself\r\nentirely in your hands, being certain that you will do what is most\r\nadvantageous for my service.”  Colbert’s zeal for his master’s service\r\nmerited this confidence.  “O,” he exclaimed one day, “that I could render\r\nthis country happy, and that, far from the court, without favor, without\r\ninfluence, the grass might grow in my very courts!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marly----525]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. was the victim of three passions which hampered and in the\r\nlong-run destroyed the accord between king and minister: that for war,\r\nwhetted and indulged by Louvois; that for kingly and courtly\r\nextravagance; and that for building and costly fancies.  Colbert likewise\r\nloved “buildments” (_les batiments_), as the phrase then was; he urged\r\nthe king to complete the Louvre, plans for which were requested of\r\nBernini, who went to Paris for the purpose; after two years’ infructuous\r\nfeelers and compliments, the Italian returned to Rome, and the work was\r\nintrusted to Perrault, whose plan for the beautiful colonnade still\r\nexisting had always pleased Colbert. The completion of the castle of\r\nSt. Germain, the works at Fontainebleau and at Chambord, the triumphal\r\narches of St. Denis and St. Martin, the laying out of the Tuileries, the\r\nconstruction of the Observatory, and even that of the Palais des\r\nInvalides, which was Louvois’ idea, found the comptroller of the finances\r\nwell disposed, if not eager.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colonnade of the Louvre  525a]\r\n\r\nVersailles was a constant source of vexation to him.  “Your Majesty is\r\ncoming back from Versailles,” he wrote to the king on the 28th of\r\nSeptember, 1685.  “I entreat that you will permit me to say two words\r\nabout the reflections I often make upon this subject, and forgive me, if\r\nit please you, for my zeal.  That mansion appertains far more to your\r\nMajesty’s pleasure and diversion than to your glory; if you would be\r\ngraciously pleased to search all over Versailles for the five hundred\r\nthousand crowns spent within two years, you would assuredly have a\r\ndifficulty in finding them.  If your Majesty thinks upon it, you will\r\nreflect that it will appear forever in the accounts of the treasurers of\r\nyour buildments that, whilst you were expending such great sums on this\r\nmansion, you neglected the Louvre, which is assuredly the most superb\r\npalace in the world, and the most worthy of your Majesty’s grandeur.  You\r\nare aware that, in default of splendid deeds of arms, there is nothing\r\nwhich denotes the grandeur and spirit of princes more plainly than\r\nbuildments do, and all posterity measures them by the ell\r\nof those superb mansions which they have erected during their lives.\r\nO, what pity it were that the greatest king and the most virtuous in that\r\ntrue virtue which makes the greatest princes should be measured by the\r\nell of Versailles!  And, nevertheless, there is room to fear this\r\nmisfortune.  For my part, I confess to your Majesty that, notwithstanding\r\nthe repugnance you feel to increase the cash-orders [_comptants_], if I\r\ncould have foreseen that this expenditure would be so large, I should\r\nhave advised the employment of cash-orders, in order to hide the\r\nknowledge thereof forever.”  [The cash-orders (_ordonnances au comptant_)\r\ndid not indicate their object, and were not revised.  The king merely\r\nwrote, Pay cash; I know the object of this expenditure (_Bon au comptant:\r\nje sais l’objet de cette depense_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Versailles---526]\r\n\r\nColbert was mistaken in his fears for Louis XIV.’s glory; if the expenses\r\nof Versailles surpassed his most gloomy apprehensions, the palace which\r\nrose upon the site of Louis XIV.’s former hunting-box was worthy of the\r\nking who had made it in his own image, and who managed to retain all his\r\ncourt around him there, by the mere fact of his will and of his royal\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nColbert was dead before Versailles was completed; the bills amounted then\r\nto one hundred and sixteen millions; the castle of Marly, now destroyed,\r\ncost more than four millions; money was everywhere becoming scarce; the\r\ntemper of the comptroller of finances went on getting worse.  “Whereas\r\nformerly it had been noticed that he set to his work rubbing his hands\r\nwith joy,” says his secretary Perrault, brother of the celebrated\r\narchitect, “he no longer worked but with an air of vexation, and even\r\nwith sighs.  From the good-natured and easy-going creature he had been,\r\nhe became difficult to deal with, and there was not so much business, by\r\na great deal, got through as in the early years of his administration.”\r\n “I do not mean to build any more, Mansard; I meet with too many\r\nmortifications,” the king would say to his favorite architect.  He still\r\nwent on building, however; but he quarrelled with Colbert over the cost\r\nof the great railings of Versailles.  There’s swindling here,” said Louis\r\nXIV.  “Sir,” rejoined Colbert, “I flatter myself, at any rate, that that\r\nword does not apply to me?”  “No,” said the king; “but more attention\r\nshould have been shown.  If you want to know what economy is, go to\r\nFlanders; you will see how little those fortifications of the conquered\r\nplaces cost.”\r\n\r\nIt was Vauban whose praise the king thus sang, and Vauban, devoted to\r\nLouvois, had for a long time past been embroiled with Colbert.  The\r\nminister felt himself beaten in the contest he had so long maintained\r\nagainst Michael Le Tellier and his son.  In 1664, at the death of\r\nChancellor Seguier, Colbert had opposed the elevation of Le Tellier to\r\nthis office, “telling the king that, if he came in, he, Colbert, could\r\nnot serve his Majesty, as he would have him thwarting everything he\r\nwanted to do.”  On leaving the council, Le Tellier said to Brienne, “You\r\nsee what a tone M. Colbert takes up; he will have to be settled with.”\r\n The antagonism had been perpetuated between Colbert and Louvois; their\r\nrivalry in the state had been augmented by the contrary dispositions of\r\nthe two ministers.  Both were passionately devoted to their work,\r\nlaborious, indefatigable, honest in money matters, and both of fierce\r\nand domineering temper; but Louvois was more violent, more bold, less\r\nscrupulous as to ways and means of attaining his end, cruel in the\r\nexercise of his will and his wrath, less concerned about the sufferings\r\nof the people, more exclusively absorbed by one fixed idea; both rendered\r\ngreat service to the king, but Colbert performing for the prince and the\r\nstate only useful offices in the way of order, economy, wise and\r\nfar-sighted administration, courageous and steady opposition; Louvois\r\never urging the king on according to his bent, as haughty and more\r\nimpassioned than he, entangling him and encouraging him in wars which\r\nrendered his own services necessary, without pity for the woes he\r\nentailed upon the nation.  It was the misfortune and the great fault of\r\nLouis XIV. that he preferred the counsels of Louvois to those of Colbert,\r\nand that he allowed all the functions so faithfully exercised by the\r\ndying minister to drop into the hands of his enemy and rival.\r\n\r\nAt sixty-four years of age Colbert succumbed to excess of labor and of\r\ncares.  That man, so cold and reserved, whom Madame de Sevigne called\r\nNorth, and Guy-Patin the Man of Marble (_Vir marmoreus_), felt that\r\ndisgust for the things of life which appears so strikingly in the\r\nseventeenth century amongst those who were most ardently engaged in the\r\naffairs of the world.  He was suffering from stone; the king sent to\r\ninquire after him and wrote to him.  The dying man had his eyes closed;\r\nhe did not open them.  “I do not want to hear anything more about him,”\r\n said he, when the king’s letter was brought to him; “now, at any rate,\r\nlet him leave me alone.”  His thoughts were occupied with his soul’s\r\nsalvation.  Madame de Maintenon used to accuse him of always thinking\r\nabout his finances, and very little about religion.  He repeated\r\nbitterly, as the dying Cardinal Wolsey had previously said in the case of\r\nHenry, “If I had done for God what I have done for that man, I had been\r\nsaved twice over; and now I know not what will become of me.”  He expired\r\non the 6th of September, 1683; and on the 10th, Madame de Maintenon wrote\r\nto Madame de St. Geran, “The king is very well; he feels no more now than\r\na slight sorrow.  The death of M. de Colbert afflicted him, and a great\r\nmany people rejoiced at that affliction.  It is all stuff about the\r\npernicious designs he had; and the king very cordially forgave him for\r\nhaving determined to die without reading his letter, in order to be\r\nbetter able to give his thoughts to God.  M. de Seignelay was anxious to\r\nstep into all his posts, and has not obtained a single one; he has plenty\r\nof cleverness, but little moral conduct.  His pleasures always have\r\nprecedence of his duties.  He has so exaggerated his father’s talents and\r\nservices, that he has convinced everybody how unworthy and incapable he\r\nis of succeeding him.”  The influence of Louvois and the king’s ill humor\r\nagainst the Colberts peep out in the injustice of Madame de Maintenon.\r\nSeignelay had received from Louis XIV. the reversion of the navy; his\r\nfather had prepared him for it with anxious strictness, and he had\r\nexercised the functions since 1676.  Well informed, clever, magnificent,\r\nSeignelay drove business and pleasure as a pair.  In 1685 he gave the\r\nking a splendid entertainment in his castle of Sceaux; in 1686 he set off\r\nfor Genoa, bombarded by Duquesne; in 1689 he, in person, organized the\r\nfleet of Tourville at Brest.  “He was general in everything,” says Madame\r\nde la Fayette; “even when he did not give the word, he had the exterior\r\nand air of it.”  “He is devoured by ambition,” Madame de Maintenon had\r\nlately said: in 1689 she writes, “_Anxious (L’Inquiet, i. e., Louvois_)\r\nhangs but by a thread; he is very much shocked at having the direction of\r\nthe affairs of Ireland taken from him; he blames me for it.  He counted\r\non making immense profits; M. de Seignelay counts on nothing but perils\r\nand labors.  He will succeed if he do not carry things with too high a\r\nhand.  The king would have no better servant, if he could rid himself a\r\nlittle of his temperament.  He admits as much himself; and yet he does\r\nnot mend.”  Seignelay died on the 3d of November, 1690, at the age of\r\nthirty-nine.  “He had all the parts of a great minister of state,” says\r\nSt. Simon, “and he was the despair of M. de Louvois, whom he often placed\r\nin the position of having not a word of reply to say in the king’s\r\npresence.  His defects corresponded with his great qualities.  As a hater\r\nand a friend he had no peer but Louvois.”  “How young! how fortunate how\r\ngreat a position!” wrote Madame de Sevigne, on hearing of the death of M.\r\nde Seignelay, “it seems as if splendor itself were dead.”\r\n\r\nSeignelay had spent freely, but he left at his death more than four\r\nhundred thousand livres a year.  Colbert’s fortune amounted to ten\r\nmillions, legitimate proceeds of his high offices and the king’s\r\nliberalities.  He was born of a family of merchants, at Rheims, ennobled\r\nin the sixteenth century, but he was fond of connecting it with the\r\nColberts of Scotland.  The great minister would often tell his children\r\nto reflect “what their birth would have done for them if God had not\r\nblessed his labors, and if those labors had not been extreme.”  He had\r\nmarried his daughters to the Dukes of Beauvilliers, Chevreuse, and\r\nMortemart; Seignelay had wedded Mdlle. de Matignon, whose grandmother was\r\nan Orleans-Longueville.  “Thus,” said Mdlle de Montpensier, “they have\r\nthe honor of being as closely related as M. le Prince to the king; Marie\r\nde Bourbon was cousin-german to the king my grandfather.  That lends a\r\ngrand air to M. de Seignelay, who had by nature sufficient vanity.”\r\n Colbert had no need to seek out genealogies, and great alliances were\r\nnaturally attracted to his power and the favor he was in.  He had in\r\nhimself that title which comes of superior merit, and which nothing can\r\nmake up for, nothing can equal.  He might have said, as Marshal Lannes\r\nsaid to the Marquis of Montesquieu, who was exhibiting a coat taken out\r\nof his ancestors’ drawers, “I am an ancestor myself.”\r\n\r\nLouvois remained henceforth alone, without rival and without check.  The\r\nwork he had undertaken for the reorganization of the army was pretty\r\nnearly completed; he had concentrated in his own hands the whole\r\ndirection of the military service, the burden and the honor of which were\r\nboth borne by him.  He had subjected to the same rules and the same\r\ndiscipline all corps and all grades; the general as well as the colonel\r\nobeyed him blindly.  M. de Turenne alone had managed to escape from the\r\nadministrative level.  “I see quite clearly,” he wrote to Louvois on the\r\n9th of September, 1673, “what are the king’s wishes, and I will do all I\r\ncan to conform to them but you will permit me to tell you that I do not\r\nthink that it would be to his Majesty’s service to give precise orders,\r\nat such a distance, to the most incapable man in France.”  Turenne had\r\nnot lost the habit of command; Louvois, who had for a long while been\r\nunder his orders, bowed to the will of the king, who required apparent\r\naccord between the marshal and the minister, but he never forgave Turenne\r\nfor his cool and proud independence.  The Prince of Conde more than once\r\nturned to advantage this latent antagonism.  After the death of Louvois\r\nand of Turenne, after the retirement of Conde, when the central power\r\nfell into the hands of Chamillard or of Voysin, the pretence of directing\r\nwar from the king’s closet at Versailles produced the most fatal effects.\r\n“If M. de Chamillard thinks that I know nothing about war,” wrote Villars\r\nto Madame de Maintenon, “he will oblige me by finding somebody else in\r\nthe kingdom who is better acquainted with it.”  “If your Majesty,” he\r\nsaid again, “orders me to shut myself up in Bavaria, and if you want to\r\nsee your army lost, I will get myself killed at the first opportunity\r\nrather than live to see such a mishap.”  The king’s orders, transmitted\r\nthrough a docile minister, ignorant of war, had a great deal to do with\r\nthe military disasters of Louis XIV.’s later years.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile order reigned in the army, and supplies were regular.  Louvois\r\nreceived the nickname of great Victualler (_Vivrier_).  The wounded were\r\ntended in hospitals devoted to their use.  “When a soldier is once down,\r\nhe never gets up again,” had but lately been the saying.  “Had I been at\r\nmy mother’s, in her own house, I could not have been better treated,”\r\n wrote M. D’Alligny on the contrary, when he came out of one of the\r\nhospitals created by Louvois.  He conceived the grand idea of the Hotel\r\ndes Invalides.  “It were very reasonable,” says the preamble of the\r\nking’s edict which founded the establishment, “that they who have freely\r\nexposed their lives and lavished their blood for the defence and\r\nmaintenance of this monarchy, who have so materially contributed to the\r\nwinning of the battles we have gained over our enemies, and who have\r\noften reduced them to asking peace of us, should enjoy the repose they\r\nhave secured for our other subjects, and should pass the remainder of\r\ntheir days in tranquillity.”  Up to his death Louvois insisted upon\r\nmanaging the Hotel des Invalides himself.\r\n\r\nNever had the officers of the army been under such strict and minute\r\nsupervision; promotion went, by seniority, by “the order on the list,” as\r\nthe phrase then was, without any favor for rank or birth; commanders were\r\nobliged to attend to their corps.  “Sir,” said Louvois one day to M. de\r\nNogaret, “your company is in a very bad state.”  “Sir,” answered Nogaret,\r\n“I was not aware of it.”  “You ought to be aware,” said M. de Louvois:\r\n“have you inspected it?”  “No, sir,” said Nogaret.  “You ought to have\r\ninspected it, sir.”  “Sir, I will give orders about it.”  “You ought to\r\nhave given them.  A man ought to make up his mind, sir, either to openly\r\nprofess himself a courtier or to devote himself to his duty when he is an\r\nofficer.”  Education in the schools for cadets, regularity in service,\r\nobligation to keep the companies full instead of pocketing a portion of\r\nthe pay in the name of imaginary soldiers who appeared only on the\r\nregisters, and who were called dummies (_passe-volants_), the necessity\r\nof wearing uniform, introduced into the army customs to which the French\r\nnobility, as undisciplined as they were brave, had hitherto been utter\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nArtillery and engineering were developed under the influence of Vauban,\r\n“the first of his own time and one of the first of all times” in the\r\ngreat art of besieging, fortifying, and defending places.  Louvois had\r\nsingled out Vauban at the sieges of Lille, Tournay, and Douai, which he\r\nhad directed in chief under the king’s own eye.  He ordered him to render\r\nthe places he had just taken impregnable.  “This is no child’s play,”\r\n said Vauban on setting about the fortifications of Dunkerque, “and I\r\nwould rather lose my life than hear said of me some day what I hear said\r\nof the men who have preceded me.”  Louvois’ admiration was unmixed when\r\nhe went to examine the works.  “The achievements of the Romans which have\r\nearned them so much fame show nothing comparable to what has been done\r\nhere,” he exclaimed; “they formerly levelled mountains in order to make\r\nhighroads, but here more than four hundred have been swept away; in the\r\nplace where all those sand-banks were there is now to be seen nothing but\r\none great meadow.  The English and the Dutch often send people hither to\r\nsee if all they have been told is true; they all go back full of\r\nadmiration at the success of the work and the greatness of the master who\r\ntook it in hand.”  It was this admiration and this dangerous greatness\r\nwhich suggested to the English their demands touching Dunkerque during\r\nthe negotiations for the peace of Utrecht.\r\n\r\nThe honesty and moral worth of Vauban equalled his genius; he was as\r\nhigh-minded as he was modest; evil reports had been spread about\r\nconcerning the contractors for the fortifications of Lille.  Vauban\r\ndemanded an inquiry.  “You are quite right in thinking, my lord,” he\r\nwrote to Louvois, to whom he was united by a sincere and faithful\r\nfriendship, “that, if you do not examine into this affair, you cannot do\r\nme justice, and, if you do it me not, that would be compelling me to seek\r\nmeans of doing it myself, and of giving up forever fortification and all\r\nits concomitants.  Examine, then, boldly and severely; away with all\r\ntender feeling, for I dare plainly tell you that in a question of\r\nstrictest honesty and sincere fidelity I fear neither the king, nor you,\r\nnor all the human race together.  Fortune had me born the poorest\r\ngentleman in France, but in requital she honored me with an honest heart,\r\nso free from all sorts of swindles that it cannot bear even the thought\r\nof them without a shudder.”  It was not until eight years after the death\r\nof Louvois, in 1699, when Vauban had directed fifty-three sieges,\r\nconstructed the fortifications of thirty-three places, and repaired those\r\nof three hundred towns, that he was made a marshal, an honor that no\r\nengineer had yet obtained.  “The king fancied he was giving himself the\r\nbaton,” it was said, “so often had he had Vauban under his orders in\r\nbesieging places.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vauban----534]\r\n\r\nThe leisure of peace was more propitious to Vauban’s fame than to his\r\nfavor.  Generous and sincere as he was, a patriot more far-sighted than\r\nhis contemporaries, he had the courage to present to the king a memorial\r\nadvising the recall of the fugitive Huguenots, and the renewal, pure and\r\nsimple, of the edict of Nantes.  He had just directed the siege of\r\nBrisach and the defence of Dunkerque when he published a great economical\r\nwork entitled _la Dime royale,_ the fruit of the reflections of his whole\r\nlife, fully depicting the misery of the people and the system of imposts\r\nhe thought adapted to relieve it.  The king was offended; he gave the\r\nmarshal a cold reception and had the work seized.  Vauban received his\r\ndeath-blow from this disgrace.  The royal edict was dated March 19, 1707;\r\nthe great engineer died on the 30th; he was not quite seventy-four.  The\r\nking testified no regret for the loss of so illustrious a servant, with\r\nwhom he had lived on terms of close intimacy.  Vauban had appeared to\r\nimpugn his supreme authority; this was one of the crimes that Louis XIV.\r\nnever forgave.\r\n\r\nIn 1683, at Colbert’s death, Vauban was enjoying the royal favor, which\r\nhe attributed entirely to Louvois.  The latter reigned without any one to\r\ncontest his influence with the master.  It had been found necessary to\r\nbury Colbert by night to avoid the insults of the people, who imputed to\r\nhim the imposts which crushed them.  What an unjust and odious mistake of\r\npopular opinion which accused Colbert of the evils which he had fought\r\nagainst and at the same time suffered under to the last day!  All\r\nColbert’s offices, except the navy, fell to Louvois or his creatures.\r\nClaude Lepelletier, a relative of Le Tellier, became comptroller of\r\nfinance; he entered the council; M. de Blainville, Colbert’s second son,\r\nwas obliged to resign in Louvois’ favor the superintendence of\r\nbuildments, of which the king had previously promised him the reversion.\r\nAll business passed into the hands of Louvois.  Le Tellier had been\r\nchancellor since 1677; peace still reigned; the all-powerful minister\r\noccupied himself in building Trianon, bringing the River Eure to\r\nVersailles, and establishing unity of religion in France.  “The counsel\r\nof constraining the Huguenots by violent means to become Catholics was\r\ngiven and carried out by the Marquis of Louvois,” says an anonymous\r\nletter of the time.  “He thought he could manage consciences and control\r\nreligion by those harsh measures which, in spite of his wisdom, his\r\nviolent nature suggests to him almost in everything.”  Louvois was the\r\ninventor, of the dragonnades; it was his father, Michael le Tellier, who\r\nput the seals to the revocation of the edict of Nantes; and, a few days\r\nbefore he died, full of joy at his last work, he piously sang the\r\ncanticle of Simeon.  Louis XIV. and his ministers believed in good faith\r\nthat Protestantism was stamped out.  “The king,” wrote Madame de\r\nMaintenon, “is very pleased to have put the last touch to the great work\r\nof the reunion of the heretics with the church.  Father la Chaise, the\r\nking’s confessor, promised that it would not cost a drop of blood, and\r\nM. de Louvois said the same thing.”  Emigration in mass, the revolt of\r\nthe Camisards, and the long-continued punishments, were a painful\r\nsurprise for the courtiers accustomed to bend beneath the will of Louis\r\nXIV.; they did not understand that “anybody should obstinately remain of\r\na religion which was displeasing to the king.”  The Huguenots paid the\r\npenalty for their obstinacy.  The intelligent and acute biographer of\r\nLouvois, M. Camille Rousset, could not defend him from the charge of\r\nviolence in their case.  On the 10th of June, 1686, he wrote to the\r\nsuperintendent of Languedoc, “On my representation to the king of the\r\nlittle heed paid by the women of the district in which you are to the\r\npenalties ordained against those who are found at assemblies, his Majesty\r\norders that those who are not demoiselles (that is, noble) shall be\r\nsentenced by M. de Baville to be whipped, and branded with the\r\nfleur-de-lis.”  He adds, on the 22d of July, “The king having thought\r\nproper to have a declaration sent out on the 15th of this month, whereby\r\nhis Majesty orders that all those who are henceforth found at such\r\nassemblies shall be punished by death, M. de Baville will take no notice\r\nof the decree I sent you relating to the women, as it becomes useless by\r\nreason of this declaration.”  The king’s declaration was carried out, as\r\nthe sentences of the victims prove:--Condemned to the galleys, or\r\ncondemned to death--for the crime of assemblies.”  This was the language\r\nof the Roman emperors.  Seventeen centuries of Christianity had not\r\nsufficed to make men comprehend the sacred rights of conscience.  The\r\nrefined and moderate mind of Madame de Sevigne did not prevent her from\r\nwriting to M. de Bussy on the 28th of October, 1685, “You have, no\r\ndoubt, seen the edict by which the king revokes that of Nantes; nothing\r\ncan be more beautiful than its contents, and never did or will any king\r\ndo anything more memorable.”  The noble libertine and freethinker\r\nreplied to her, “I admire the steps taken by the king to reunite the\r\nHuguenots.  The war made upon them in former times and the St.\r\nBartholomew gave vigor to this sect; his Majesty has sapped it little by\r\nlittle, and the edict he has just issued, supported by dragoons and\r\nBourdaloues, has given it the finishing stroke.”  It was the honorable\r\ndistinction of the French Protestants to proclaim during more than two\r\ncenturies, by their courageous resistance, the rights and duties which\r\nwere ignored all around them.\r\n\r\nWhilst the reformers were undergoing conversion, exile, or death, war was\r\nrecommencing in Europe, with more determination than ever on the part of\r\nthe Protestant nations, indignant and disquieted as they were.  Louvois\r\nbegan to forget all about the obstinacy of the religionists, and prepared\r\nfor the siege of Philipsburg and the capture of Manheim and Coblentz.\r\n“The king has seen with pleasure,” he wrote to Marshal Boufflers, “that,\r\nafter well burning Coblentz, and doing all the harm possible to the\r\nelector’s palace, you were to march back to Mayence.”  The haughtiness of\r\nthe king and the violence of the minister went on increasing with the\r\nsuccess of their arms; they treated the pope’s rights almost as lightly\r\nas those of the Protestants.  The pamphleteers of the day had reason to\r\nwrite, “It is clearly seen that the religion of the court of France is a\r\npure matter of interest; the king does nothing but what is for that which\r\nhe calls his glory and grandeur; Catholics and heretics, Holy Pontiff,\r\nchurch, and anything you please, are sacrificed to his great pride;\r\neverything must be reduced to powder beneath his feet; we in France are\r\non the high road to putting the sacred rights of the Holy See on the same\r\nfooting as the privileges granted to Calvinists; all ecclesiastical\r\nauthority is annihilated.  Nobody knows anything of canons, popes,\r\ncouncils; everything is swallowed up in the authority of one man.”  “The\r\nking willeth it:” France had no other law any longer; and William III.\r\nsaved Europe from the same enslavement.\r\n\r\nThe Palatinate was in flames; Louvois was urging on the generals and\r\narmies everywhere, sending despatch after despatch, orders upon orders.\r\n“I am a thousand times more impatient to finish this business than you\r\ncan be,” was the spirited reply he received from M. de la Hoguette, who\r\ncommanded in Italy, in the environs of Cuneo; “besides the reasons of\r\nduty which I have always before my eyes, I beg you to believe that the\r\nlast letters I received from you were quite strong enough to prevent\r\nnegligence of anything that must be done to prevent similar ones, and to\r\ndeserve a little more confidence; but the most willing man can do nothing\r\nagainst roads encumbered with ice and snow.”  Louvois did not admit this\r\nexcuse; he wanted soldiers to be able to cross the defiles of mountains\r\nin the depths of winter just as he would have orange trees travel in the\r\nmonth of February.  “I received orders to send off to Versailles from La\r\nMeilleraye the orange trees which the Duke of Mazarin gave the king,”\r\n writes Superintendent Foucauld in his journal.  “M. Louvois, in spite of\r\nthe representations I made him, would have them sent by carriage through\r\nthe snow and ice.  They arrived leafless at Versailles, and several are\r\ndead.  I had sent him word that the king could take towns in winter, but\r\ncould not make orange trees bear removal from their hothouses.”  The\r\nnature and the consciences of the Protestants were all that withstood\r\nLouis XIV. and Louvois.  On the 16th of July, 1691, death suddenly\r\nremoved the minister, fallen in royal favor, detested and dreaded in\r\nFrance, universally hated in Europe, leaving, however, the king, France,\r\nand Europe with the feeling that a great power had fallen, a great deal\r\nof merit disappeared.  “I doubt not,” wrote Louis XIV. to Marshal\r\nBoufflers, “that, as you are very zealous for my service, you will be\r\nsorry for the death of a man who served me well.”  “Louvois,” said the\r\nMarquis of La Fare, “should never have been born, or should have lived\r\nlonger.”  The public feeling was expressed in an anonymous epitaph:\r\n\r\n“Here lieth he who to his will\r\nBent every one, knew everything\r\nLouvois, beloved by no one,\r\nstill Leaves everybody sorrowing.”\r\n\r\nThe king felt his loss, but did not regret the minister whose tyranny and\r\nviolence were beginning to be oppressive to him.  He felt himself to be\r\nmore than ever master in the presence of the young or inexperienced men\r\nto whom he henceforth intrusted his affairs.  Louvois’ son, Barbezieux,\r\nhad the reversion of the war department; Pontchartrain, who had been\r\ncomptroller of finance ever since the retirement of Lepelletier, had been\r\nappointed to the navy in 1690, at the death of Seignelay.  “M. de\r\nPontchartrain had begged the king not to give him the navy,” says Dangeau\r\ningenuously, “because he knew nothing at all about it; but the king’s\r\nwill was absolute that he should take it.  He now has all that M. de\r\nColbert had, except the buildments.”  What mattered the inexperience of\r\nministers?  The king thought that he alone sufficed for all.\r\n\r\nGod had left it to time to undeceive the all-powerful monarch; he alone\r\nheld out amidst the ruins; after the fathers the sons were falling around\r\nhim; Seignelay had followed Colbert to the tomb; Louvois was dead after\r\nMichael Le Tellier; Barbezieux died in his turn in 1701.  “This secretary\r\nof state had naturally good wits, lively and ready conception, and great\r\nmastery of details in which his father had trained him early,” writes the\r\nMarquis of Argenson.  He had been spoiled in youth by everybody but his\r\nfather.  He was obliged to put himself at the mercy of his officials, but\r\nhe always kept up his position over them, for the son of M. de Louvois,\r\ntheir creator, so to speak, could not fail to inspire them with respect,\r\nveneration, and even attachment.  Louis XIV., who knew the defects of M.\r\nde Barbezieux, complained to him, and sometimes rated him in private, but\r\nhe left him his place, because he felt the importance of preserving in\r\nthe administration of war the spirit and the principles of Louvois.\r\n“Take him for all in all,” says St. Simon, “he had the making of a great\r\nminister in him, but wonderfully dangerous; the best and most useful\r\nfriend in the world so long as he was one, and the most terrible, the\r\nmost inveterate, the most implacable and naturally ferocious enemy; he\r\nwas a man who would not brook opposition in anything, and whose audacity\r\nwas extreme.”  A worthy son of Louvois, as devoted to pleasure as he\r\nwas zealous in business, he was carried off in five days, at the age of\r\nthirty-three.  The king, who had just put Chamillard into the place of\r\nPontchartrain, made chancellor at the death of Boucherat, gave him the\r\nwar department in succession to Barbezieux, “thus loading such weak\r\nshoulders with two burdens of which either was sufficient to break down\r\nthe strongest.”\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. had been faithfully and mightily served by Colbert and\r\nLouvois; he had felt confidence in them, though he had never had any\r\nliking for them personally; their striking merits, the independence of\r\ntheir character, which peeped out in spite of affected expressions of\r\nsubmission and deference, the spirited opposition of the one and the\r\npassionate outbursts of the other, often hurt the master’s pride, and\r\nalways made him uncomfortable; Colbert had preceded him in the\r\ngovernment, and Louvois, whom he believed himself to have trained, had\r\nsurpassed him in knowledge of affairs as well as aptitude for work;\r\nChamillard was the first, the only one of his ministers whom the king had\r\never loved.  “His capacity was nil,” says St. Simon, who had very\r\nfriendly feelings towards Chamillard, “and he believed that he knew\r\neverything and of every sort; this was the more pitiable in that it had\r\ngot into his head with his promotions, and was less presumption than\r\nstupidity, and still less vanity, of which he had none.  The joke is,\r\nthat the mainspring of the king’s great affection for him was this very\r\nincapacity.  He confessed it to the king at every step, and the king was\r\ndelighted to direct and instruct him; in such sort that he grew jealous\r\nfor his success as if it were his own, and made every excuse for him.”\r\n\r\nThe king loved Chamillard; the court bore with him because he was easy\r\nand good-natured, but the affairs of the state were imperilled in his\r\nhands; Pontchartrain had already had recourse to the most objectionable\r\nproceedings in order to obtain money; the mental resources of Colbert\r\nhimself had failed in presence of financial embarrassments and increasing\r\nestimates.  It is said that, during the war with Holland, Louvois induced\r\nthe king to contract a loan; the premier-president, Lamoignon, supported\r\nthe measure.  “You are triumphant,” said Colbert, who had vigorously\r\nopposed it; “you think you have done the deed of a good man; what! did\r\nnot I know as well as you that the king could get money by borrowing?\r\nBut I was careful not to say so.  And so the borrowing road is opened.\r\nWhat means will remain henceforth of checking the king in his\r\nexpenditure?  After the loans, taxes will be wanted to pay them; and, if\r\nthe loans have no limit, the taxes will have none either.”  At the king’s\r\ndeath the loans amounted to more than two milliards and a half, the\r\ndeficit was getting worse and worse every day, there was no more money to\r\nbe had, and the income from property went on diminishing.  “I have only\r\nsome dirty acres which are turning to stones instead of being bread,”\r\n wrote Madame de Sevigne.  Trade was languishing, the manufactures founded\r\nby Colbert were dropping away one after another; the revocation of the\r\nedict of Nantes and the emigration of Protestants had drained France of\r\nthe most industrious and most skilful workmen; many of the Reformers had\r\ncarried away a great deal of capital; the roads, everywhere neglected,\r\nwere becoming impracticable.  “The tradesmen are obliged to put four\r\nhorses instead of two to their wagons,” said a letter to Barbezieux from\r\nthe superintendent of Flanders, “which has completely ruined the\r\ntraffic.”  The administration of the provinces was no longer under\r\nsupervision.  “Formerly,” says Villars, “the inspectors would pass whole\r\nwinters on the frontiers; now they are good for nothing but to take the\r\nheight and measure of the men and send a fine list to the court.”  The\r\nsoldiers were without victuals, the officers were not paid, the abuses\r\nbut lately put down by the strong hand of Colbert and Louvois were\r\ncropping up again in all directions; the king at last determined to\r\nlisten to the general cry and dismiss Chamillard.\r\n\r\n“The Dukes of Beauvilliers and Chevreuse were intrusted with this\r\nunpleasant commission, as well as with the king’s assurance of his\r\naffection and esteem for Chamillard, and with the announcement of the\r\nmarks thereof he intended to bestow upon him.  They entered Chamillard’s\r\npresence with such an air of consternation as may be easily imagined,\r\nthey having always been very great friends of his.  By their manner the\r\nunhappy minister saw at once that there was something extraordinary, and,\r\nwithout giving them time to speak, ‘What is the matter, gentlemen?’ he\r\nsaid with a calm and serene countenance.  ‘If what you have to say\r\nconcerns me only, you can speak out; I have been prepared a long while\r\nfor anything.’  They could scarcely tell what brought them.  Chamillard\r\nheard them without changing a muscle, and with the same air and tone with\r\nwhich he had put his first question, he answered, ‘The king is master.\r\nI have done my best to serve him; I hope another may do it more to his\r\nsatisfaction and more successfully.  It is much to be able to count upon\r\nhis kindness and to receive so many marks of it.’  Then he asked whether\r\nhe might write to him, and whether they would do him the favor of taking\r\ncharge of his letter.  He wrote the king, with the same coolness, a page\r\nand a half of thanks and regards, which he read out to them at once just\r\nas he had at once written it in their presence.  He handed it to the two\r\ndukes, together with the memorandum which the king had asked him for in\r\nthe morning, and which he had just finished, sent word orally to his wife\r\nto come after him to L’Etang, whither he was going, without telling her\r\nwhy, sorted out his papers, and gave up his keys to be handed to his\r\nsuccessor.  All this was done without the slightest excitement; without\r\na sigh, a regret, a reproach, a complaint escaping him, he went down his\r\nstaircase, got into his carriage, and started off to L’Etang, alone with\r\nhis son, just as if nothing had happened to him, without anybody’s\r\nknowing anything about it at Versailles until long afterwards.”\r\n [Memoires de St. Simon, t. iii.  p. 233.]\r\n\r\nDesmarets in the finance and Voysin in the war department, both\r\nsuperintendents of finance, the former a nephew of Colbert’s and\r\ninitiated into business by his uncle, both of them capable and assiduous,\r\nsuccumbed, like their predecessors, beneath the weight of the burdens\r\nwhich were overwhelming and ruining France.  “I know the state of my\r\nfinances,” Louis XIV. had said to Desmarets; “I do not ask you to do\r\nimpossibilities; if you succeed, you will render me a great service; if\r\nyou are not successful, I shall not hold you to blame for circumstances.”\r\n Desmarets succeeded better than could have been expected without being\r\nable to rehabilitate the finances of the state.  Pontchartrain had\r\nexhausted the resource of creating new offices.  “Every time your Majesty\r\ncreates a new post, a fool is found to buy it,” he had said to the king.\r\nDesmarets had recourse to the bankers; and the king seconded him by the\r\ngracious favor with which he received at Versailles the greatest of the\r\ncollectors (_traitants_), Samuel Bernard.  “By this means everything was\r\nprovided for up to the time of the general peace,” says M. d’Argenson.\r\nFrance kept up the contest to the end.  When the treaty of Utrecht was\r\nsigned, the fleet was ruined and destroyed, the trade diminished by two\r\nthirds, the colonies lost or devastated by the war, the destitution in\r\nthe country so frightful that orders had to be given to sow seed in the\r\nfields; the exportation of grain was forbidden on pain of death;\r\nmeanwhile the peasantry were reduced to browse upon the grass in the\r\nroads and to tear the bark off the trees and eat it.  Thirty years had\r\nrolled by since the death of Colbert, twenty-two since that of Louvois;\r\neverything was going to perdition simultaneously; reverses in war and\r\ndistress at home were uniting to overwhelm the aged king, alone\r\nupstanding amidst so many dead and so much ruin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Misery of the Peasantry----543]\r\n\r\n“Fifty years’ sway and glory had inspired Louis XIV. with the\r\npresumptuous belief that he could not only choose his ministers well, but\r\nalso instruct them and teach them their craft,” says M. d’Argenson.  His\r\nmistake was to think that the title of king supplied all the endowments\r\nof nature or experience; he was no financier, no soldier, no\r\nadministrator, yet he would everywhere and always remain supreme master;\r\nhe had believed that it was he who governed with Colbert and Louvois;\r\nthose two great ministers had scarcely been equal to the task imposed\r\nupon them by war and peace, by armies, buildments, and royal\r\nextravagance; their successors gave way thereunder and illusions\r\nvanished; the king’s hand was powerless to sustain the weight of affairs\r\nbecoming more and more disastrous; the gloom that pervaded the later\r\nyears of Louis XIV.’s reign veiled from his people’s eyes the splendor of\r\nthat reign which had so long been brilliant and prosperous, though always\r\nlying heavy on the nation, even when they forgot their sufferings in the\r\nintoxication of glory and success.\r\n\r\nIt is the misfortune of men, even of the greatest, to fall short of their\r\ndestiny.  Louis XIV. had wanted to exceed his, and to bear a burden too\r\nheavy for human shoulders.  Arbiter, for a while, of the affairs of all\r\nEurope, ever absolute master in his own dominions, he bent at last\r\nbeneath the load that was borne without flinching by princes less\r\npowerful, less fortunate, less adored, but sustained by the strong\r\ninstitutions of free countries.  William III. had not to serve him a\r\nConde, a Turenne, a Colbert, a Louvois; he had governed from afar his own\r\ncountry, and he had always remained a foreigner in the kingdom which had\r\ncalled him to the throne; but, despite the dislikes, the bitternesses,\r\nthe fierce contests of parties, he had strengthened the foundations of\r\nparliamentary government in England, and maintained freedom in Holland,\r\nwhilst the ancient monarchy of France, which reached under Louis XIV.\r\nthe pinnacle of glory and power, was slowly but surely going down to\r\nperdition beneath the internal and secret malady of absolute power,\r\nwithout limit and without restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.----LOUIS XIV. AND RELIGION.\r\n\r\nIndependently of simple submission to the Catholic church, there were\r\nthree great tendencies which divided serious minds amongst them during\r\nthe reign of Louis XIV.; three noble passions held possession of pious\r\nsouls; liberty, faith, and love were, respectively, the groundwork as\r\nwell as the banner of Protestantism, Jansenism, and Quietism.  It was in\r\nthe name of the fundamental and innate liberty of the soul, its personal\r\nresponsibility and its direct relations with God, that the Reformation\r\nhad sprung up and reached growth in France, even more than in Germany and\r\nin England.  M. de St. Cyran, the head and founder of Jansenism,\r\nabandoned the human soul unreservedly to the supreme will of God; his\r\nfaith soared triumphant over flesh and blood, and his disciples,\r\ndisdaining the joys and the ties of earth, lived only for eternity.\r\nMadame Guyon and Fenelon, less ardent and less austere, discovered in the\r\ntender mysticism of pure love that secret of God’s which is sought by all\r\npious souls; in the name of divine love, the Quietists renounced all will\r\nof their own, just as the Jansenists in the name of faith.\r\n\r\nJansenism is dead after having for a long while brooded in the depths of\r\nthe most noble souls; Quietism, as a sect, did not survive its\r\nillustrious founders; faith and love have withstood the excess of zeal\r\nand the erroneous tendencies which had separated them from the aggregate\r\nof Christian virtues and doctrines; they have come back again into the\r\npious treasury of the universal church.  Neither time nor persecutions\r\nhave been able to destroy in France the strong and independent groundwork\r\nof Protestantism.  Faithful to its fundamental principle, it has\r\ntriumphed over exile, the scaffold, and indifference, without other head\r\nthan God himself and God alone.\r\n\r\nRichelieu had slain the political hydra of Huguenots in France; from that\r\ntime the Reformers had lived in modest retirement.  “I have no complaint\r\nto make of the little flock,” Mazarin would say; “if they eat bad grass,\r\nat any rate they do not stray.”  During the troubles of the Fronde, the\r\nProtestants had resumed, in the popular vocabulary, their old nickname of\r\n_Tant s’en fault_ (Far from it), which had been given them at the time of\r\nthe League.  “Faithful to the king in those hard times when most\r\nFrenchmen were wavering and continually looking to see which way the .\r\nwind would blow, the Huguenots had been called _Tant s’en fault,_ as\r\nbeing removed from and beyond all suspicion of the League or of\r\nconspiracy against the state.  And so were they rightly designated,\r\ninasmuch as to the cry, ‘_Qui vive?_’ (Whom are you for?) instead of\r\nanswering ‘Vive Guise!’ or ‘Vive la Ligue!’ they would answer, ‘_Tant\r\ns’en fault, vive le Roi!_’  So that, when one Leaguer would ask another,\r\npointing to a Huguenot, ‘Is that one of ours?’  ‘Tant s’en fault,’ would\r\nbe the reply, ‘it is one of the new religion.’”  Conde had represented to\r\nCromwell all the Reformers of France as ready to rise up in his favor;\r\nthe agent sent by the Protector assured him it was quite the contrary;\r\nand the bearing of the Protestants decided Cromwell to refuse all\r\nassistance to the princes.  La Rochelle packed off its governor, who was\r\nfavorable to the Fronde; St. Jean d’Angely equipped soldiers for the\r\nking; Montauban, to resist the Frondeurs, repaired the fortifications\r\nthrown down by Richelieu.  “The crown was tottering upon the king’s\r\nhead,” said Count d’ Harcourt to the pastors of Guienne, “but you have\r\nmade it secure.”  The royal declaration of 1652, confirming and ratifying\r\nthe edict of Nantes, was a recompense for the services and fidelity of\r\nthe Huguenots.  They did not enjoy it long; an edict of 1656 annulled, at\r\nthe same time explaining, the favorable declaration of 1652; in 1660 the\r\nlast national synod was held at Loudun.  “His Majesty has resolved,” said\r\nM. de la Magdelaine, deputed from the king to the synod, “that there\r\nshall be no more such assemblies but when he considers it expedient.”\r\n Fifteen years had rolled by since the synod of Charenton in 1645.  “We\r\nare only too firmly persuaded of the usefulness of our synods, and how\r\nentirely necessary they are for our churches, after having been so long\r\nwith out them,” sorrowfully exclaimed the moderator, Peter Daille.\r\n\r\nFor two hundred and twelve years the Reformed church of France was\r\ndeprived of its synods.  God at last restored to it this corner-stone of\r\nits interior constitution.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the edict-chambers instituted by Henry IV. in all the\r\nParliaments for the purpose of taking cognizance of the affairs of the\r\nReformers followed close upon the abolition of national synods.  Peter\r\ndu Bosq, pastor of the church of Caen, an accomplished gentleman and\r\ncelebrated preacher, was commissioned to set before the king the\r\nrepresentations of the Protestants.  Louis XIV. listened to him kindly.\r\n“That is the finest speaker in my kingdom,” he said to his courtiers\r\nafter the minister’s address.  The edict-chambers were, nevertheless,\r\nsuppressed in 1669; the half and half (_mi partie_) chambers, composed of\r\nReformed and Catholic councillors, underwent the same fate in 1679, and\r\nthe Protestants found themselves delivered over to the intolerance and\r\nreligious prejudices of the Parliaments, which were almost everywhere\r\nharsher, as regarded them, than the governors and superintendents of\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n“It seemed to me, my son,” wrote Louis XIV. in his _Memoires_ of the year\r\n1661, “that those who were for employing violent remedies against the\r\nreligion styled Reformed, did not understand the nature of this malady,\r\ncaused partly by heated feelings, which should be passed over unnoticed\r\nand allowed to die out insensibly, instead of being inflamed afresh by\r\nequally strong contradiction, which, moreover, is always useless, when\r\nthe taint is not confined to a certain known number, but spread\r\nthroughout the state.  I thought, therefore, that the best way of\r\nreducing the Huguenots of my kingdom little by little, was, in the first\r\nplace, not to put any pressure upon them by any fresh rigor against them,\r\nto see to the observance of all that they had obtained from my\r\npredecessors, but to grant them nothing further, and even to confine the\r\nperformance thereof within the narrowest limits that justice and\r\npropriety would permit.  But as to graces that depended upon me alone, I\r\nhave resolved, and I have pretty regularly kept my resolution ever since,\r\nnot to do them any, and that from kindness, not from bitterness, in order\r\nto force them in that way to reflect from time to time of themselves, and\r\nwithout violence, whether it were for any good reason that they deprived\r\nthemselves voluntarily of advantages which might be shared by them in\r\ncommon with all my other subjects.”\r\n\r\nThese prudent measures, “quite in kindness and not in bitterness,” were\r\nnot enough to satisfy the fresh zeal with which the king had been\r\ninspired.  All-powerful in his own kingdom, and triumphant everywhere in\r\nEurope, he was quite shocked at the silent obstinacy of those Huguenots\r\nwho held his favor and graces cheap in comparison with a quiet\r\nconscience; his kingly pride and his ignorant piety both equally urged\r\nhim on to that enterprise which was demanded by the zeal of a portion of\r\nthe clergy.  The system of purchasing conversions had been commenced; and\r\nPellisson, himself originally a Protestant, had charge of the payments, a\r\nsource of fraud and hypocrisies of every sort.  A declaration of 1679\r\ncondemned the relapsed to _honorable amends_ (public recantation, &c.),\r\nto confiscation and to banishment.  The door’s of all employments were\r\nclosed against Huguenots; they could no longer sit in the courts or\r\nParliaments, or administer the finances, or become medical practitioners,\r\nbarristers, or notaries; infants of seven years of age were empowered to\r\nchange their religion against their parents’ will; a word, a gesture, a\r\nlook, were sufficient to certify that a child intended to abjure; its\r\nparents, however, were bound to bring it up according to its condition,\r\nwhich often facilitated confiscation of property.  Pastors were forbidden\r\nto enter the houses of their flocks, save to perform some act of their\r\nministry; every chapel into which a new convert had been admitted was to\r\nbe pulled down, and the pastor was to be banished.  It was found\r\nnecessary to set a guard at the doors of the places of worship to drive\r\naway the poor wretches who repented of a moment’s weakness; the number of\r\n“places of exercise,” as the phrase then was, received a gradual\r\nreduction; “a single minister had the charge of six, eight, and ten\r\nthousand persons,” says Elias Benoit, author of the _Histoire de l’Edit\r\nde Nantes,_ making it impossible for him to visit and assist the\r\nfamilies, scattered sometimes over a distance of thirty leagues round his\r\nown residence.  The wish was to reduce the ministers to give up\r\naltogether from despair of discharging their functions.  The chancellor\r\nhad expressly said, “If you are reduced to the impossible, so much the\r\nworse for you; we shall gain by it.”  Oppression was not sufficient to\r\nbreak down the Reformers.  There was great difficulty in checking\r\nemigration, by this time increasing in numbers.  Louvois proposed\r\nstronger measures.  The population was crushed under the burden of\r\nmilitary billets.  Louvois wrote to Marillac, superintendent of Poitou,\r\n“His Majesty has learned with much joy the number of people who continue\r\nto become converts in your department.  He desires you to go on paying\r\nattention thereto; he will think it a good idea to have most of the\r\ncavalry and officers quartered upon Protestants; if, according to the\r\nregular proportion, the religionists should receive ten, you can make\r\nthem take twenty.”  The dragoons took up their quarters in peaceable\r\nfamilies, ruining the more well-to-do, maltreating old men, women, and\r\nchildren, striking them with their sticks or the flat of their swords,\r\nhauling off Protestants in the churches by the hair of their heads,\r\nharnessing laborers to their own ploughs, and goading them like oxen.\r\nConversions became numerous in Poitou.  Those who could fly left France,\r\nat the risk of being hanged if the attempt happened to fail.  “Pray lay\r\nout advantageously the money you are going to have,” wrote Madame de\r\nMaintenon to her brother, M. d’Aubigne.  “Land in Poitou is to be had for\r\nnothing, and the desolation amongst the Protestants will cause more sales\r\nstill.  You may easily settle in grand style in that province.”  “We are\r\ntreated like enemies of the Christian denomination,” wrote, in 1662, a\r\nminister named Jurieu, already a refugee in Holland.  “We are forbidden\r\nto go near the children that come into the world, we are banished from\r\nthe bars and the faculties, we are forbidden the use of all the means\r\nwhich might save us from hunger, we are abandoned to the hatred of the\r\nmob, we are deprived of that precious liberty which we purchased with so\r\nmany services, we are robbed of our children, who are a part of\r\nourselves.  .  .  .  Are we Turks?  Are we infidels?  We believe in Jesus\r\nChrist, we do; we believe Him to be the Eternal Son of God, the Redeemer\r\nof the world; the maxims of our morality are of so great purity that none\r\ndare gainsay them; we respect the king; we are good subjects, good\r\ncitizens; we are Frenchmen as much as we are Reformed Christians.” Jurieu\r\nhad a right to speak of the respect for the king which animated the\r\nFrench Reformers.  There was no trace left of that political leaven which\r\nformerly animated the old Huguenots, and made Duke Henry de Rohan say,\r\n“You are all republicans; I would rather have to do with a pack of wolves\r\nthan an assembly of parsons.”  “The king is hood winked,” the Protestants\r\ndeclared; and all their efforts were to get at him and tell his Majesty\r\nof their sufferings.  The army remained open to them, though without hope\r\nof promotion; and the gentlemen showed alacrity in serving the king.\r\n“What a position is ours!” they would say; if we make any resistance, we\r\nare treated as rebels; if we are obedient, they pretend we are converted,\r\nand they hoodwink the king by means of our very submission.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Torture of the Huguenots---552]\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes were redoubling.  From Poitou the persecution had\r\nextended through all the provinces.  Superintendent Foucauld obtained the\r\nconversion in mass of the province of Bearn.  He egged on the soldiers to\r\ntorture the inhabitants of the houses they were quartered in, commanding\r\nthem to keep awake all those who would not give in to other tortures.\r\nThe dragoons relieved one another so as not to succumb themselves to the\r\npunishment they were making others undergo.  Beating of drums,\r\nblasphemies, shouts, the crash of furniture which they hurled from side\r\nto side, commotion in which they kept these poor people in order to force\r\nthem to be on their feet and hold their eyes open, were the means they\r\nemployed to deprive them of rest.  To pinch, prick, and haul them about,\r\nto lay them upon burning coals, and a hundred other cruelties, were the\r\nsport of these butchers.  All they thought most about was how to find\r\ntortures which should be painful without being deadly, reducing their\r\nhosts thereby to such a state that they knew not what they were doing,\r\nand promised anything that was wanted of them in order to escape from\r\nthose barbarous bands.  Languedoc, Guienne, Angoumois, Saintonge, all the\r\nprovinces in which the Reformers were numerous, underwent the same fate.\r\nThe self-restraining character of the Norman people, their respect for\r\nlaw, were manifested even amidst persecution; the children were torn away\r\nfrom Protestant families, and the chapels were demolished by act of\r\nParliament; the soldiery were less violent than elsewhere, but the\r\nmagistrates were more inveterate.  “God has not judged us unworthy to\r\nsuffer ignominy for His name,” said the ministers condemned by the\r\nParliament for having performed the offices of their ministry.  “The king\r\nhas taken no cognizance of the case,” exclaimed one of the accused,\r\nLegendre, pastor of Rouen; “he has relied upon the judges; it is not his\r\nMajesty who shall give account before God; you shall be responsible, and\r\nyou alone; you who, convinced as you are of our innocence, have\r\nnevertheless condemned us and branded us.”  “The Parliament of Normandy\r\nhas just broken the ties which held us bound to our churches,” said Peter\r\ndu Bosq.  The banished ministers took the road to Holland.  The seaboard\r\nprovinces were beginning to be dispeopled.  A momentary disturbance,\r\nwhich led to belief in a rising of the Reformers in the Cevennes and the\r\nVivarais, served as pretext for redoubled rigor.  Dauphiny and Languedoc\r\nwere given up to the soldiery; murder was no longer forbidden them, it\r\nwas merely punishing rebels; several pastors were sentenced to death;\r\nHomel, minister of Soyon in the Vivarais, seventy-five years of age, was\r\nbroken alive on the wheel.  Abjurations multiplied through terror.\r\n“There have been sixty thousand conversions in the jurisdiction of\r\nBordeaux, and twenty thousand in that of Montauban,” wrote Louvois to his\r\nfather in the first part of September, 1685; “the rapidity with which\r\nthis goes on is such, that, before the end of the month, there will not\r\nremain ten thousand religionists in the district of Bordeaux, in which\r\nthere were a hundred and fifty thousand on the 15th of last month.”  “The\r\ntowns of Nimes, Alais, Uzes, Villeneuve, and some others, are entirely\r\nconverted,” writes the Duke of Noailles to Louvois in the month of\r\nOctober, 1685; “those of most note in Nimes made abjuration in church the\r\nday after our arrival.  There was then a lukewarmness; but matters were\r\nput in good train again by means of some billets that I had put into the\r\nhouses of the most obstinate.  I am making arrangements for going and\r\nscouring the Uvennes with the seven companies of Barbezieux, and my head\r\nshall answer for it that before the 25th of November not a Huguenot shall\r\nbe left there.”\r\n\r\nAnd a few days later, at Alais--“I no longer know what to do with the\r\ntroops, for the places in which I had meant to, post them get converted\r\nall in a body, and this goes on so quickly that all the men can do is to\r\nsleep for a night at the localities to which I send them.  It is certain\r\nthat you may add very nearly a third to the estimate given you of the\r\npeople of the religion, amounting to the number of a hundred and\r\neighty-two thousand men, and, when I asked you to give me until the,\r\n25th of next month for their complete conversion, I took too long a\r\nterm, for I believe that by the end of the month all will be settled.  I\r\nwill not, however, omit to tell you that all we have done in these\r\nconversions will be nothing but useless, if the king do not oblige the\r\nbishops to send good priests to instruct the people who want to hear the\r\ngospel preached. But I fear that the king will be worse obeyed in that\r\nrespect by the priests than by the religionists.  I do not tell you this\r\nwithout grounds.”  “There is not a courier who does not bring the king\r\ngreat causes for joy,” writes Madame de Maintenon, “that is to say,\r\nconversions by thousands.  I can quite believe that all these\r\nconversions are not sincere, but God makes use of all ways of bringing\r\nback heretics.  Their children, at any rate, will be Catholics; their\r\noutward reunion places them within reach of the truth; pray God to\r\nenlighten them all; there is nothing the king has more at heart.”\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1684, she said, “The king has a design of\r\nlaboring for the entire conversion of the heretics.  He often has\r\nconferences about it with M. Le Tellier and M. de Chateauneuf, whereat\r\nI was given to understand that I should not be one too many.  M. de\r\nChateauneuf proposed measures which are not expedient.  There must be no\r\nprecipitation; it must be conversion, not persecution.  M. de Louvois was\r\nfor gentleness, which is not in accordance with his nature and his\r\neagerness to see matters ended.  The king is ready to do what is thought\r\nmost likely to conduce to the good of religion.  Such an achievement will\r\ncover him with glory before God and before men.  He will have brought\r\nback all his subjects into the bosom of the church, and will have\r\ndestroyed the heresy which his predecessors could not vanquish.”\r\n\r\nThe king’s glory was about to be complete; the _gentleness_ of Louvois\r\nhad prevailed; he had found himself obliged to moderate the zeal of his\r\nsuperintendents; “nothing remained but to weed out the religionists of\r\nthe small towns and villages;” by stretching a point the process had been\r\ncarried into the principality of Orange, which still belonged to the\r\nhouse of Nassau, on the pretext that the people of that district had\r\nreceived in their chapels the king’s subjects.  The Count of Tesse, who\r\nhad charge of the expedition, wrote to Louvois, “Not only, on one and the\r\nsame day, did the whole town of Orange become converted, but the state\r\ntook the same resolution, and the members of the Parliament, who were\r\nminded to distinguish themselves by a little more stubbornness, adopted\r\nthe same course twenty-four hours afterwards.  All this was done gently,\r\nwithout violence or disorder.  There is only a parson named Chambrun,\r\npatriarch of the district, who persists in refusing to listen to reason;\r\nfor the president, who did aspire to the honor of martyrdom, would, as\r\nwell as the rest of the Parliament, have turned Mohammedan, if I had\r\ndesired it.  You would not believe how infatuated all these people were,\r\nand are still, about the Prince of Orange, his authority, Holland,\r\nEngland, and the Protestants of Germany.  I should never end if I were to\r\nrecount all the foolish and impertinent proposals they have made to me.”\r\n M. de Tesse did not tell Louvois that he was obliged to have the pastors\r\nof Orange seized and carried off.  They were kept twelve years in prison\r\nat Pierre-Encise; none but M. de Chambrun, who had been taken to Valence,\r\nmanaged to escape and take refuge in Holland, bemoaning to the end of his\r\ndays a moment’s weakness.  “I was quite exhausted by torture, and I let\r\nfall this unhappy expression: ‘Very well, then, I will be reconciled.’\r\nThis sin has brought me down as it were into hell itself, and I have\r\nlooked upon myself as a dastardly soldier who turned his back on the day\r\nof battle, and as an unfaithful servant who betrayed the interests of his\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\nThe king assembled his council.  The lists of converts were so long that\r\nthere could scarcely remain in the kingdom more than a few thousand\r\nrecalcitrants.  “His Majesty proposed to take an ultimate resolution as\r\nregarded the Edict of Nantes,” writes the Duke of Burgundy in a\r\nmemorandum found amongst his papers.  “Monseigneur represented that,\r\naccording to an anonymous letter he had received the day before, the\r\nHuguenots had some expectation of what was coming upon them, that there\r\nwas perhaps some reason to fear that they would take up arms, relying\r\nupon the protection of the princes of their religion, and that, supposing\r\nthey dared not do so, a great number would leave the kingdom, which would\r\nbe injurious to commerce and agriculture, and, for that same reason,\r\nwould weaken the state.  The king replied that he had foreseen all for\r\nsome time past, and had provided for all; that nothing in the world would\r\nbe more painful to him than to shed a single drop of the blood of his\r\nsubjects, but that he had armies and good generals whom he would employ\r\nin case of need against rebels who courted their own destruction.  As for\r\ncalculations of interest, he thought them worthy of but little\r\nconsideration in comparison with the advantages of a measure which would\r\nrestore to religion its splendor, to the state its tranquillity, and to\r\nauthority all its rights.  A resolution was carried unanimously for the\r\nsuppression of the Edict of Nantes.”  The declaration, drawn up by\r\nChancellor Le Tellier and Chateauneuf, was signed by the king on the 15th\r\nof October, 1685; it was despatched on the 17th to all the\r\nsuperintendents.  The edict of pacification, that great work of the\r\nliberal and prudent genius of Henry IV., respected and confirmed in its\r\nmost important particulars by Cardinal Richelieu, recognized over and\r\nover again by Louis XIV. himself, disappeared at a single stroke,\r\ncarrying with it all hope of liberty, repose, and justice, for fifteen\r\nhundred thousand subjects of the king.  “Our pains,” said the preamble of\r\nthe edict, “have had the end we had proposed, seeing that the better and\r\nthe greater part of our subjects of the religion styled Reformed have\r\nembraced the Catholic.  The execution of the Edict of Nantes consequently\r\nremaining useless, we have considered that we could not do better, for\r\nthe purpose of effacing entirely the memory of the evils which this false\r\nreligion has caused in our kingdom, than revoke entirely the aforesaid\r\nEdict of Nantes, and all that has been done in favor of the said\r\nreligion.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Revocation of the Edict of Nantes----556]\r\n\r\nThe edict of October 15, 1685, supposed the religion styled Reformed to\r\nbe already destroyed and abolished.  It ordered the demolition of all the\r\nchapels that remained standing, and interdicted any assembly or worship;\r\nrecalcitrant (_opiniatres_) ministers were ordered to leave the kingdom\r\nwithin fifteen days; the schools were closed; all new-born babies were to\r\nbe baptized by the parish priests; religionists were forbidden to leave\r\nthe kingdom on pain of the galleys for the men and confiscation of person\r\nand property for the women.  “The will of the king,” said superintendent\r\nMarillac at Rouen, “is, that there be no more than one religion in this\r\nkingdom; it is for the glory of God and the well-being of the state.”\r\n Two hours were allowed the Reformers of Rouen for making their\r\nabjuration.\r\n\r\nOne clause, at the end of the edict of October 15, seemed to extenuate\r\nits effect.  “Those of our subjects of the religion styled Reformed who\r\nshall persist in their errors, pending the time when it may please God to\r\nenlighten them like the rest, shall be allowed to remain in the kingdom,\r\ncountry, and lands, which obey the king, there to continue their trade\r\nand enjoy their property without being liable to be vexed or hindered on\r\npretext of prayer or worship of the said religion of whatsoever nature\r\nthey may be.”  “Never was there illusion more cruel than that which this\r\nclause caused people,” says Benoit, in his _Histoire de l’Edit de\r\nNantes_.”  It was believed that the king meant only to forbid special\r\nexercises, but that he intended to leave conscience free, since he\r\ngranted this grace to all those who were still Reformers, pending the\r\ntime when it should please God to enlighten them.  Many gave up the\r\nmeasures they had taken for leaving the country with their families, many\r\nvoluntarily returned from the retreats where they had hitherto been\r\nfortunate enough to lie hid.  The most mistrustful dared not suppose that\r\nso solemn a promise was only made to be broken on the morrow.  They were\r\nall, nevertheless, mistaken; and those who were imprudent enough to\r\nreturn to their homes were only just in time to receive the dragoons\r\nthere.”  A letter from Louvois to the Duke of Noailles put a stop to all\r\nillusion.  “I have no doubt,” he wrote, “that some rather heavy billets\r\nupon the few amongst the nobility and third estate still remaining of the\r\nreligionists will undeceive them as to the mistake they are under about\r\nthe edict M. de Chateauneuf drew up for us.  His Majesty desires that you\r\nshould explain yourself very sternly, and that extreme severity should be\r\nemployed against those who are not willing to become of his religion;\r\nthose who have the silly vanity to glory in holding out to the last must\r\nbe driven to extremity.”  The pride of Louis XIV. was engaged in the\r\nstruggle; those of his subjects who refused to sacrifice their religion\r\nto him were disobedient, rebellious, and besotted with silly vanity.\r\n“It will be quite ridiculous before long to be of that religion,” wrote\r\nMadame de Maintenon.\r\n\r\nEven in his court and amongst his most useful servants the king\r\nencountered unexpected opposition.  Marshal Schomberg with great\r\ndifficulty obtained authority to leave the kingdom; Duquesne was refused.\r\nThe illustrious old man, whom the Algerian corsairs called “the old\r\nFrench capitan, whose bride is the sea, and whom the angel of death has\r\nforgotten,” received permission to reside in France without being\r\ntroubled about his religion.  “For sixty years I have rendered to Caesar\r\nthat which was Caesar’s,” said the sailor proudly; “it is time to render\r\nunto God that which is God’s.”  And, when the king regretted that his\r\nreligion prevented him from properly recognizing his glorious career,\r\n“Sir,” said Duquesne, “I am a Protestant, but I always thought that my\r\nservices were Catholic.”  Duquesne’s children went abroad.  When he died,\r\n1688, his body was refused to them.  His sons raised a monument to him at\r\nAubonne, in the canton of Berne, with this inscription: “This tomb awaits\r\nthe remains of Duquesne.  Passer, should you ask why the Hollanders have\r\nraised a superb monument to Ruyter vanquished, and why the French have\r\nrefused a tomb to Ruyter’s vanquisher, the fear and respect inspired by a\r\nmonarch whose power extends afar do not allow me to answer.”\r\n\r\nOf the rest, only the Marquis of Ruvigny and the Princess of Tarento,\r\ndaughter-in-law of the Duke of La Tremoille and issue of the house of\r\nHesse, obtained authority to leave France.  All ports were closed, all\r\nfrontiers watched.  The great lords gave way, one after another.\r\nAccustomed to enjoy royal favors, attaching to them excessive value,\r\nliving at court, close to Paris, which was spared a great deal during the\r\npersecution, they, without much effort, renounced a faith which closed to\r\nthem henceforth the door to all offices and all honors.  The gentlemen of\r\nthe provinces were more resolute; many realized as much as they could of\r\ntheir property, and went abroad, braving all dangers, even that of the\r\ngalleys in case of arrest.  The Duke of La Force had abjured, then\r\nrepented of his abjuration, only to relapse again.  One of his cousins,\r\nseventy-five years of age, was taken to the galleys.  He had for his\r\ncompanion Louis de Marolles, late king’s councillor.  “I live just now\r\nall alone,” wrote the latter to his wife.  “My meals are brought from\r\noutside; if you saw me in my beautiful convict-dress, you would be\r\ncharmed.  The iron I wear on my leg, though it weighs only three pounds,\r\ninconvenienced me at first far more than that which you saw me in at La\r\nTournelle.”  Files of Protestant galley-convicts were halted in the\r\ntowns, in the hope of inspiring the obstinate with a salutary terror.\r\n\r\nThe error which had been fallen into, however, was perceived at court.\r\nThe stand made by Protestants astounded the superintendents as well as\r\nLouvois himself.  Everywhere men said, as they said at Dieppe, “We will\r\nnot change our religion for anybody; the king has power over our persons\r\nand our property, but he has no power over our consciences.”  There was\r\nfleeing in all directions.  The governors grew weary of watching the\r\ncoasts and the frontiers.  “The way to make only a few go,” said Louvois,\r\n“is to leave them liberty to do so without letting them know it.”  Any\r\nway was good enough to escape from such oppression.  “Two days ago,”\r\n wrote M. de Tesse, who commanded at Grenoble, “a woman, to get safe away,\r\nhit upon an invention which deserves to be known.  She made a bargain\r\nwith a Savoyard, an ironmonger, and had herself packed up in a load of\r\niron rods, the ends of which showed.  It was carried to the custom-house,\r\nand the tradesman paid on the weight of the iron, which was weighed\r\ntogether with the woman, who was not unpacked until she was six leagues\r\nfrom the frontier.”  “For a long time,” says M. Floquet, “there was talk\r\nin Normandy of the Count of Marance, who, in the middle of a severe\r\nwinter, flying with thirty-nine others on board a fishing-smack,\r\nencountered a tempest, and remained a long time at sea without\r\nprovisions, dying of hunger, he, the countess, and all the passengers,\r\namongst whom were pregnant women, mothers with infants at the breast,\r\nwithout resources of any sort, reduced for lack of everything to a little\r\nmelted snow, with which they moistened the parched lips of the dying\r\nbabes.”  It were impossible to estimate precisely the number of\r\nemigrations; it was probably between three and four hundred thousand.\r\n“To speak only of our own province,” writes M. Floquet in his _Histoire\r\ndu Parlement de Normandie,_ “about one hundred and eighty-four thousand\r\nreligionists went away; more than twenty-six thousand habitations were\r\ndeserted; in Rouen there were counted no more than sixty thousand men\r\ninstead of the eighty thousand that were to be seen there a few years\r\nbefore.  Almost all trade was stopped there as well as in the rest of\r\nNormandy.  The little amount of manufacture that was possible rotted away\r\non the spot for want of transport to foreign countries, whence vessels\r\nwere no longer found to come.  Rouen, Darnetal, Elbeuf, Louviers,\r\nCaudebec, Le Havre, Pont-Audemer, Caen,  St. Lo, Alencon, and Bayeux were\r\nfalling into decay, the different branches of trade and industry which\r\nhad but lately been seen flourishing there having perished through the\r\nemigration of the masters whom their skilled workmen followed in shoals.”\r\n The Norman emigration had been very numerous, thanks to the extent of its\r\ncoasts and to the habitual communication between Normandy, England, and\r\nHolland; Vauban, however, remained very far from the truth when he\r\ndeplored, in 1688, “the desertion of one hundred thousand men, the\r\nwithdrawal from the kingdom of sixty millions of livres, the enemy’s\r\nfleets swelled by nine thousand sailors, the best in the kingdom, and the\r\nenemy’s armies by six hundred officers and twelve thousand soldiers, who\r\nhad seen service.”  It is a natural but a striking fact that the\r\nReformers who left France and were received with open arms in\r\nBrandenburg, Holland, England, and Switzerland carried in their hearts a\r\nprofound hatred for the king who drove them away from their country, and\r\neverywhere took service against him, whilst the Protestants who remained\r\nin France, bound to the soil by a thousand indissoluble ties, continued\r\nat the same time to be submissive and faithful.  “It is right,” said\r\nChanlay, in a Memoire addressed to the king, “whilst we condemn the\r\nconduct of the new converts, fugitives, who have borne arms against\r\nFrance since the commencement of this war up to the present, it is right,\r\nsay I, to give those who have staid in France the praise and credit they\r\ndeserve.  Indeed, if we except a few disturbances of little consequence\r\nwhich have taken place in Languedoc, we have, besides the fact of their\r\nremaining faithful to the king in the provinces, and especially in\r\nDauphiny, even whilst the confederated armies of the emperor, of Spain,\r\nand of the Duke of Savoy were in the heart of that province in greater\r\nstrength than the forces of the king, to note that those who were fit to\r\nbear arms have enlisted amongst the troops of his Majesty and done good\r\nservice.”  In 1745, after sixty years’ persecution, consequent upon the\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes, Matthew Desubas, a young pastor\r\naccused before the superintendent of Languedoc, Lenain, said with\r\nhigh-spirited modesty, “The ministers preach nothing but patience and\r\nfidelity to the king.”  I am aware of it, sir,” answered the\r\nsuperintendent.  The pastors were hanged or burned, the faithful flock\r\ndragged to the galleys and the Tower of Constance.  Prayers for the\r\nking, nevertheless, were sent up from the proscribed assemblies in the\r\ndesert, whilst the pulpit of Saurin at the Hague resounded with his\r\nanathemas against Louis XIV., and the regiments of emigrant Huguenots\r\nwere marching against the king’s troops under the flags of England or\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Ryswick had not brought the Protestants the hoped-for\r\nalleviation of their woes.  Louis XIV. haughtily rejected the petition of\r\nthe English and Dutch plenipotentiaries on behalf of “those in affliction\r\nwho ought to have their share in the happiness of Europe.”  The\r\npersecution everywhere continued,--with determination and legality in the\r\nnorth, with violence and passion in the south, abandoned to the tyranny\r\nof M. de Lamoignon de Baville, a crafty and cold-bloodedly cruel\r\npolitician, without the excuse of any zealous religious conviction.  The\r\nexecution of several ministers who had remained in hiding in the\r\nCevennes, or had returned from exile to instruct and comfort their\r\nflocks, raised to the highest pitch the enthusiasm of the Reformers of\r\nLanguedoc.  Deprived of their highly-prized assemblies and of their\r\npastors’ guidance, men and women, graybeards and children, all at once\r\nfancied themselves animated by the spirit of prophecy.  Young girls had\r\ncelestial visions; the little peasant lasses poured out their utterances\r\nin French, sometimes in the language and with the sublime eloquence of\r\nthe Bible, sole source of their religious knowledge.  The rumor of these\r\nmarvels ran from village to village; meetings were held to hear the\r\ninspired maidens, in contempt of edicts, the galleys, and the stake.  A\r\ngentleman glass-worker, named Abraham de la Serre, was, as it were, the\r\nSamuel of this new school of prophets.  In vain did M. de Baville have\r\nthree hundred children imprisoned at Uzes, and then send them to the\r\ngalleys; the religious contagion was too strong for the punishments.\r\n“Women found themselves in a single day husbandless, childless,\r\nhouseless, and penniless,” says Court; they remained immovable in their\r\npious ecstasy; the assemblies multiplied; the troops which had so long\r\noccupied Languedoc had been summoned away by the war of succession in\r\nSpain; the militia could no longer restrain the Reformers growing every\r\nday more enthusiastic through the prophetic hopes which were born of\r\ntheir long sufferings.  The arch-priest of the Cevennes, Abbe du Chayla,\r\na tyrannical and cruel man, had undertaken a mission at the head of the\r\nCapuchins.  His house was crammed with condemned Protestants; the breath\r\nof revolt passed over the mountains on the night of July 27, 1702, the\r\ncastle of the arch-priest was surrounded by Huguenots in arms, who\r\ndemanded the surrender of the prisoners.  Du Chayla refused.  The gates\r\nwere forced, the condemned released, the priests who happened to be in\r\nthe house killed or dispersed.  The archpriest had let himself down by a\r\nwindow; he broke his thigh; he was found hiding in a bush; the castle was\r\nin flames.  “No mercy, no mercy!” shouted the madmen; “the Spirit willeth\r\nthat he die.”  Every one of the Huguenots stabbed the poor wretch with\r\ntheir poniards: “That’s for my father, broken on the wheel; that’s for my\r\nbrother, sent to the galleys; that’s for my mother, who died of grief;\r\nthat’s for my relations in exile!”  He received fifty-two wounds.  Next\r\nday the Cevennes were everywhere in revolt.  A prophet named Seguier was\r\nat the head of the insurrection.  He was soon made prisoner.  “How dost\r\nthou expect me to treat thee?” asked his judge.  “As I would have treated\r\nthee, had I caught thee,” answered the prophet.  He was burned alive in\r\nthe public square of Pont-de-Montvert, a mountain burgh.  “Where do you\r\nlive?” he had been asked at his examination.  “In the desert,” he\r\nreplied, “and soon in heaven.”  He exhorted the people from the midst of\r\nthe flames.  The insurrection went on spreading.  “Say not, What can we\r\ndo? we are so few; we have no arms!” said another prophet, named Laporte.\r\n“The Lord of hosts is our strength!  We will intone the battle-psalms,\r\nand, from the Lozere to the sea, Israel shall arise!  And, as for arms,\r\nhave we not our axes?  They will beget muskets!”  The plain rose like the\r\nmountain.  Baron St. Comes, an early convert, and colonel of the militia,\r\nwas assassinated near Vauvert; murders multiplied; the priests were\r\nespecially the object of the revolters’ vengeance.  They assembled under\r\nthe name of _Children of God,_ and marched under the command of two\r\nchiefs, one, named Roland, who formerly served under Catinat, and the\r\nother, a young man, whiles a baker and whiles a shepherd, who was born in\r\nthe neighborhood of Anduze, and whose name has remained famous.\r\nJohn Cavalier was barely eighteen when M. de Baville launched his\r\nbrother-in-law, the Count of Broglie, with a few troops upon the\r\nrevolted Cevenols. The Catholic peasants called them Camisards, the\r\norigin of which name has never been clearly ascertained.  M. de Broglie\r\nwas beaten; the insurrection, which was entirely confined to the\r\npopulace, disappeared all at once in the woods and rocks of the country,\r\nto burst once more unexpectedly upon the troops of the king.  The great\r\nname of Lamoignon shielded Baville; Chamillard had for a long while\r\nconcealed from Louis XIV. the rising in the Cevennes.  He never did know\r\nall its gravity.  “It is useless,” said Madame de Maintenon, “for the\r\nking to trouble himself with all the circumstances of this war; it would\r\nnot cure the mischief, and would do him much.”  “Take care,” wrote\r\nChamillard to Baville, on superseding the Count of Broglie by Marshal\r\nMontrevel, “not to give this business the appearance of a serious war.”\r\n The rumor of the insurrection in Languedoc, however, began to spread in\r\nEurope.  Conflagrations, murders, executions in cold blood or in the\r\nheat of passion, crimes on the part of the insurgents, as well as\r\ncruelties on the part of judges and generals, succeeded one another\r\nuninterruptedly, without the military authorities being able to crush a\r\nrevolt that it was impossible to put down by terror or punishments.  “I\r\ntake it for a fact,” said a letter to Chamillard from M. de Julien, an\r\nable captain of irregulars, lately sent into Languedoc to aid the Count\r\nof Broglie, “that there are not in this district forty who are real\r\nconverts, and are not entirely on the side of the Camisards.  I include\r\nin that number females as well as males, and the mothers and daughters\r\nwould give the more striking proofs of their fury if they had the\r\nstrength of the men.  .  .  .  I will say but one word more, which is,\r\nthat the children who were in their cradles at the time of the general\r\nconversions, as well as those who were four or five years old, are now\r\nmore Huguenot than the fathers; nobody, however, has set eyes upon any\r\nminister; how, then, comes it that they are so Huguenot?  Because the\r\nfathers and mothers brought them up in those sentiments all the time\r\nthey were going to mass.  You may rely upon it that this will continue\r\nfor many generations.”  M. de Julien came to the conclusion that the\r\nproper way was to put to the sword all the Protestants of the country\r\ndistricts and burn all the villages.  M. de Baville protested.  “It is\r\nnot a question of exterminating these people,” he said, “but of reducing\r\nthem, of forcing them to fidelity; the king must have industrious people\r\nand flourishing districts preserved to him.” The opinion of the generals\r\nprevailed; the Cevenols were proclaimed outlaws, and the pope decreed a\r\ncrusade against them.  The military and religious enthusiasm of the\r\nCamisards went on increasing.  Cavalier, young and enterprising, divided\r\nhis time between the boldest attempts at surprise and mystical\r\necstasies, during which he singled out traitors who would have\r\nassassinated him or sinners who were not worthy to take part in the\r\nLord’s Supper. The king’s troops ravaged the country; the Camisards, by\r\nway of reprisal, burned the Catholic villages; everywhere the war was\r\nbecoming horrible.  The peaceable inhabitants, Catholic or Protestant,\r\nwere incessantly changing from wrath to terror. Cavalier, naturally\r\nsensible and humane, sometimes sank into despondency.  He would fling\r\nhimself on his knees, crying, Lord, turn aside the king from following\r\nthe counsels of the wicked!” and then he would set off again upon a new\r\nexpedition.  The struggle had been going on for two years, and Languedoc\r\nwas a scene of fire and bloodshed.  Marshal Montrevel had gained great\r\nadvantages when the king ordered Villars to put an end to the revolt.\r\n“I made up my mind,” writes Villars, in his Memoires, “to try\r\neverything, to employ all sorts of ways except that of ruining one of\r\nthe finest provinces in the kingdom, and that, if I could bring back the\r\noffenders without punishing them, I should preserve the best soldiers\r\nthere are in the kingdom.  They are, said I to myself, Frenchmen, very\r\nbrave and very strong, three qualities to be considered.”  “I shall\r\nalways,” he adds, “have two ears for two sides.”\r\n\r\n“We have to do here with a very extraordinary people,” wrote the marshal\r\nto Chamillard, soon after his arrival; “it is a people unlike anything I\r\never knew--all alive, turbulent, hasty, susceptible of light as well as\r\ndeep impressions, tenacious in its opinions.  Add thereto zeal for\r\nreligion, which is as ardent amongst heretics as Catholics, and you will\r\nno longer be surprised that we should be often very much embarrassed.\r\nThere are three sorts of Camisards: the first, with whom we might arrange\r\nmatters by reason of their being weary of the miseries of war.  The\r\nsecond, stark mad on the subject of religion, absolutely intractable on\r\nthat point; the first little boy or little girl that falls a-trembling\r\nand declares that the Holy Spirit is speaking to it, all the people\r\nbelieve it, and, if God with all his angels were to come and speak to\r\nthem, they would not believe them more; people, moreover, on whom the\r\npenalty of death makes not the least impression; in battle they thank\r\nthose who inflict it upon them; they walk to execution singing the\r\npraises of God and exhorting those present, insomuch that it has often\r\nbeen necessary to surround the criminals with drums to prevent the\r\npernicious effect of their speeches.  Finally, the third: people without\r\nreligion, accustomed to pillage, to murder, to quarter themselves upon\r\nthe peasants; a rascalry furious, fanatical, and swarming with\r\nprophetesses.”\r\n\r\nVillars had arrived in Languedoc the day after the checks encountered by\r\nthe Camisards.  The despondency and suffering were extreme; and the\r\nmarshal had Cavalier sounded.\r\n\r\n“What do you want to lay down your arms?” said the envoy.  “Three\r\nthings,” replied the Cevenol chief: “liberty of conscience, the release\r\nof our brethren detained in the prisons and the galleys, and if these\r\ndemands are refused, permission to quit France with ten thousand\r\npersons.”  The negotiators were intrusted with the most flattering offers\r\nfor Cavalier.  Sensible, and yet vain, moved by his country’s woes, and\r\nflattered by the idea of commanding a king’s regiment, the young Camisard\r\nallowed himself to be won.  He repaired formally to Nimes for an\r\ninterview with the marshal.  “He is a peasant of the lowest grade,” wrote\r\nVillars to Chamillard, “who is not twenty-two, and does not look\r\neighteen; short, and with no imposing air, qualities essential for the\r\nlower orders, but surprising good sense and firmness.  I asked him\r\nyesterday how he managed to keep his fellows under.  ‘Is it possible,’\r\nsaid I, ‘that, at your age, and not being long used to command, you found\r\nno difficulty in often ordering to death your own men?’  ‘No, sir,’ said\r\nhe, ‘when it seemed to me just.’  ‘But whom did you employ to inflict\r\nit?’  ‘The first whom I ordered, and nobody ever hesitated to follow my\r\norders.’  I fancy, sir, that you will consider this rather surprising.\r\nFurthermore, he shows great method in the matter of his supplies, and he\r\ndisposes his troops for an engagement as well as very experienced\r\nofficers could do.  It is a piece of luck if I get such a man away from\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nCavalier’s fellows began to escape from his sway.  They had hoped, for a\r\nwhile, that they would get back that liberty for which they had shed\r\ntheir blood.  “They are permitted to have public prayer and chant their\r\npsalms.  No sooner was that known all round,” writes Villars, “than\r\nbehold my madmen rushing up from burghs and castles in the neighborhood,\r\nnot to surrender, but to chant with the rest.  The gates were closed;\r\nthey leap the walls and force the guards.  It is published abroad that I\r\nhave indefinitely granted free exercise of the religion.”  The bishops\r\nlet the marshal be.\r\n\r\n“Stuff we our ears,” said the Bishop of Narbonne, “and make we an end.”\r\n The Camisards refused to listen to Cavalier.\r\n\r\n“Thou’rt mad,” said Roland; “thou bast betrayed thy brethren; thou\r\nshouldst die of shame.  Go tell the marshal that I am resolved to remain\r\nsword in hand until the entire and complete restoration of the Edict of\r\nNantes!”  The Cevenols thought themselves certain of aid from England;\r\nonly a handful followed Cavalier, who remained faithful to his\r\nengagements.  He was ordered with his troop to Elsass; he slipped away\r\nfrom his watchers and threw himself into Switzerland.  At the head of a\r\nregiment of refugees he served successively the Duke of Savoy, the\r\nStates-General, and England; he died at Chelsea in 1740, the only one\r\namongst the Camisards to leave a name in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Death of Roland the Camisard----569]\r\n\r\nThe insurrection still went on in Languedoc under the orders of Roland,\r\nwho was more fanatical and more disinterested than Cavalier; he was\r\nbetrayed and surrounded in the castle of Castelnau on the 16th of August,\r\n1704.  Roland just had time to leap out of bed and mount his horse; he\r\nwas taking to flight with his men by a back door when a detachment of\r\ndragoons came up with him; the Camisard chief put his back against an old\r\nolive and sold his life dearly.  When he fell, his lieutenants let\r\nthemselves be taken “like lambs” beside his corpse.  “They were destined\r\nto serve as examples,” writes Villars, “but the manner in which they met\r\ndeath was more calculated to confirm their religious spirit in these\r\nwrong heads than to destroy it.  Lieutenant Maille was a fine young man\r\nof wits above the common.  He heard his sentence with a smile, passed\r\nthrough the town of Nimes with the same air, begging the priest not to\r\nplague him; the blows dealt him did not alter this air in the least, and\r\ndid not elicit a single exclamation.  His arms broken, he still had\r\nstrength to make signs to the priest to be off, and, as long as he could\r\nspeak, he encouraged the others.  That made me think that the quickest\r\ndeath is always best with these fellows, and that their sentence should\r\nabove all things bear reference to their obstinacy in revolt rather than\r\nin religion.”  Villars did not carry executions to excess, even in the\r\ncase of the most stubborn; little by little the chiefs were killed off in\r\npetty engagements or died in obscurity of their wounds; provisions were\r\nbecoming scarce; the country was wasted; submission became more frequent\r\nevery day.  The principals all demanded leave to quit France.  “There are\r\nleft none but a few brigands in the Upper Cevennes,” says Villars.  Some\r\npartial risings, alone recalled, up to 1709, the fact that the old leaven\r\nstill existed; the war of the Camisards was over.  It was the sole\r\nattempt in history on the part of French Protestantism since Richelieu,\r\na strange and dangerous effort made by an ignorant and savage people;\r\nroused to enthusiasm by persecution, believing itself called upon by the\r\nspirit of God to win, sword in hand, the freedom of its creed under the\r\nleadership of two shepherd soldiers and prophets.  Only the Scottish\r\nCameronians have presented the same mixture of warlike ardor and pious\r\nenthusiasm, more gloomy and fierce with the men of the North, more\r\npoetical and prophetical with the Cevenols, flowing in Scotland as in\r\nLanguedoc from religious oppression and from constant reading of the Holy\r\nScriptures.  The silence of death succeeded everywhere in France to the\r\nplaints of the Reformers and to the crash of arms; Louis XIV. might well\r\nsuppose that Protestantism in his dominions was dead.\r\n\r\nIt was a little before the time when the last of the Camisards, Abraham\r\nMazel and Claris, perished near Uzes (in 1710), that the king struck the\r\nlast blow at Jansenism by destroying its earliest nest and its last\r\nrefuge, the house of the nuns of Port-Royal des Champs.  With truces and\r\nintervals of apparent repose, the struggle had lasted more than sixty\r\nyears between the Jesuits and Jansenism.  M. de St. Cyran, who left the\r\nBastille a few months after the death of Richelieu, had dedicated the\r\nlast days of his life to writing against Protestantism, being so much the\r\nmore scared by the heresy in that, perhaps, he felt himself attracted\r\nthereto by a secret affinity.  He was already dying when there appeared\r\nthe book Frequente Communion, by M. Arnauld, youngest son and twentieth\r\nchild of that illustrious family of Arnaulds in whom Jansenism seemed to\r\nbe personified.  The author was immediately accused at Rome, and buried\r\nhimself for twenty years in retirement.  M. de St. Cyran was still\r\nworking, dictating Christian thoughts and points touching death.\r\n_Stantem mori oportet_ (One should die in harness), he would say.  On the\r\n3d of October, 1643, he succumbed suddenly, in the arms of his friends.\r\n“I cast my eyes upon the body, which was still in the same posture in\r\nwhich death had left it,” writes Lancelot, “and I thought it so full of\r\nmajesty and of mien so dignified that I could not tire of admiring it,\r\nand I fancied that he would still have been capable, in the state in\r\nwhich he was, of striking with awe the most passionate of his foes, had\r\nthey seen him.”  It was the most cruel blow that could have fallen upon\r\nthe pious nuns of Port-Royal.  “_Dominus in coelo!_  (Lord in heaven!)”\r\n was all that was said by Mother Angelica Arnauld, who, like M. de St.\r\nCyran himself, centred all her thoughts and all her affections upon\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nWith his dying breath M. de St. Cyran had said to M. Gudrin, physician to\r\nthe college of Jesuits, “Sir, tell your Fathers, when I am dead, not to\r\ntriumph, and that I leave behind me a dozen stronger than I.”  With all\r\nhis penetration the director of consciences was mistaken; none of those\r\nhe left behind him would have done his work; he had inspired with the\r\nsame ardor and the same constancy the strong and the weak, the violent\r\nand the pacific; he had breathed his mighty faith into the most diverse\r\nsouls, fired with the same zeal penitents and nuns, men rescued from the\r\nscorching furnace of life in the world, and women brought up from infancy\r\nin the shade of the cloister.  M. Arnauld was a great theologian, an\r\nindefatigable controversialist, the oracle and guide of his friends in\r\ntheir struggle against the Jesuits; M. de Sacy and M. Singlin were wise\r\nand able directors, as austere as M. de St. Cyran in their requirements,\r\nless domineering and less rough than he; but M. de St. Cyran alone was\r\nand could be the head of Jansenism; he alone could have inspired that\r\nidea of immolation of the whole being to the sovereign will of God, as to\r\nthe truth which resides in Him alone.  Once assured of this point, M. de\r\nSt. Cyran became immovable.  Mother Angelica pressed him to appear before\r\nthe archbishop’s council, which was to pronounce upon his book _Theologie\r\nfamiliere_.  “It is always good to humble one’s self,” she said.  “As for\r\nyou,” he replied, “who are in that disposition, and would not in any\r\nrespect compromise the honor of the truth, you could do it; but as for\r\nme, I should break down before the eyes of God if I consented thereto;\r\nthe weak are more to be feared sometimes than the wicked.”\r\n\r\nMother Angelica Arnauld, to whom these lines were addressed, was the most\r\nperfect image and the most accomplished disciple of M. de St. Cyran.\r\nMore gentle and more human than he, she was quite as strong and quite as\r\nzealous.  “It is necessary to be dead to everything, and after that to\r\nawait everything; such was the motto of her inward life and of the\r\nconstant effort made by this impassioned soul, susceptible of all tender\r\naffections, to detach herself violently and irrevocably from earth.  The\r\ninstinct of command, loftiness and breadth of views, find their place\r\nwith the holy priest and with the nun; the mind of M. de St. Cyran was\r\nless practical and his judgment less simple than that of the abbess,\r\nhabituated as she had been from childhood to govern the lives of her nuns\r\nas their conscience.  A reformer of more than one convent since the day\r\nwhen she had closed the gates of Port-Royal against her father,\r\nM. Arnauld, in order to restore the strictness of the cloister, Mother\r\nAngelica carried rule along with her, for she carried within herself the\r\ngovernment, rigid, no doubt, for it was life in a convent, but\r\ncharacterized by generous largeness of heart, which caused the yoke to be\r\neasily borne.\r\n\r\n“To be perfect, there is no need to do singular things,” she would often\r\nrepeat, after St. Francis de Sales; “what is needed is to do common\r\nthings singularly well!”  She carried the same zeal from convent to\r\nconvent, from Port-Royal des Champs to Port-Royal de Paris; from\r\nMaubuisson, whither her superiors sent her to establish a reformation, to\r\nSt. Sacrement, to establish union between the two orders; ever devoted to\r\nreligion, without having chosen her vocation; attracting around her all\r\nthat were hers; her mother, a wife at twelve years of age, and astonished\r\nto find herself obeying after having commanded her twenty children for\r\nfifty years; five of her sisters; nieces and cousins; and in “the\r\nDesert,” beside Port-Royal des Champs, her brothers, her nephews, her\r\nfriends, steeped like herself in penitence.  Before her, St. Bernard had\r\n“dispeopled the world “ of those whom he loved, by an error common to\r\nzealous souls and exclusive spirits, solely occupied with thoughts of\r\nsalvation.  Even in solitude Mother Angelica had not found rest.  “I am\r\nnot fit to live on earth,” she would say; “I know not why I am still\r\nthere; I can no longer bear either myself or others; there is none that\r\nseeketh after God.”  She was piously unjust towards her age, and still\r\nmore towards her friends; it was the honorable distinction of M. de St.\r\nCyran and his disciples that they did seek after God and holiness, at\r\nevery cost and every risk.\r\n\r\nMother Angelica was nearing the repose of eternity, the only repose\r\nadmitted by her brother M. Arnauld, when the storm of persecution burst\r\nupon the monastery.  The Augustinus of Jansenius, Bishop of Ypres, a\r\nfriend of M. de St. Cyran’s, had just been condemned at Rome.  Five\r\npropositions concerning grace were pronounced heretical.  “The pope has a\r\nright to condemn them,” said the Jansenists, “if they are to be found in\r\nthe Augustinus, but, in fact, they are not to be found there.”  The\r\ndispute waxed hot; M. Arnauld threw himself into it passionately.  He, in\r\nhis turn, was condemned by the Sorbonne.  “This is the very day,” he\r\nwrote to his sister, Mother Angelica, “when I am to be wiped out from the\r\nnumber of the doctors; I hope of God’s goodness that He will not on that\r\naccount wipe me out from the number of His servants.  That is the only\r\ntitle I desire to preserve.”  M. Arnauld’s friends pressed him to protest\r\nagainst his condemnation.  “Would you let yourself be crushed like a\r\nchild?” they said.  He wrote in the theologian’s vein, lengthily and\r\nbitterly; his friends listened in silence.  Arnauld understood them.\r\n“I see quite well that you do not consider this document a good one for\r\nits purpose,” said he, “and I think you are right; but you who are\r\nyoung,” and he turned towards Pascal, who had a short time since retired\r\nto Port-Royal, “you ought to do something.”  This was the origin of the\r\n_Lettres Provinciales_.  For the first time Pascal wrote, something other\r\nthan a treatise on physics.  He revealed himself all at once and\r\nentirely.  The recluses of Port-Royal were obliged to close their\r\nschools; they had to disperse.  Arnauld concealed himself with his friend\r\nNicole.  “I am having search made everywhere for M. Arnauld,” said Louis\r\nXIV. to Boileau, who was supposed to be much attached to the Jansenists.\r\n“Your Majesty always was lucky,” replied Boileau; “you will not find\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nThe nuns’ turn had come; orders were given to send away the pensioners\r\n(pupils); Mother Angelica set out for the house at Paris, “where was the\r\nbattle-ground.”  [_Memoires pour servir a l’Histoire de Port-Royal,_\r\nt. ii.  p. 127.] As she was leaving the house in the fields, which was so\r\ndear to her, she met in the court-yard M. d’Andilly, her brother, who was\r\nwaiting to say good by to her.  When he came up to her, she said to him,\r\n“Good by, my dear brother; be of good courage, whatever happens.”  “Fear\r\nnothing, my dear sister; I am perfectly so.”  But she replied, “Brother,\r\nbrother, let us be humble.  Let us remember that humility without\r\nfortitude is cowardice, but that fortitude without humility is\r\npresumption.”  “When she arrived at the convent in Paris, she found us\r\nfor the most part very sad,” writes her niece, Mother Angelica de St.\r\nJean, “and some were in tears.  She, looking at us with an open and\r\nconfident countenance, said, ‘Why, I believe there is weeping here!\r\nCome, my children, what is all this?  Have you no faith?  And at what are\r\nyou dismayed?  What if men do rage?  Eh?  Are you afraid of that?  They\r\nare but flies!  You hope in God, and yet fear anything!  Fear but Him,\r\nand, trust me, all will be well;’ and to Madame de Chevreuse, who came to\r\nfetch her daughters, ‘Madame, when there is no God I shall lose courage;\r\nbut, so long as God is God, I shall hope in Him.’”  She succumbed,\r\nhowever, beneath the burden; and the terror she had always felt of death\r\naggravated her sufferings.  “Believe me, my children,” she would say to\r\nthe nuns, “believe what I tell you.  People do not know what death is,\r\nand do not think about it.  As for me, I have apprehended it all my life,\r\nand have always been thinking about it.  But all I have imagined is less\r\nthan nothing in comparison with what it is, with what I feel, and with\r\nwhat I comprehend at this moment.  It would need but such thoughts to\r\ndetach us from everything.”  M. Singlin, being obliged to conceal\r\nhimself, came secretly to see her; she would not have her nephew, M. de\r\nSacy, run the same risk.  “I shall never see him more,” she said; “it is\r\nGod’s will; I do not vex myself about it.  My nephew without God could be\r\nof no use to me, and God without my nephew will be all in all to me.”\r\n The grand-vicar of the Archbishop of Paris went to Port-Royal to make\r\nsure that the pensioners had gone.  He sat down beside Mother Angelica’s\r\nbed.  “So you are ill, mother,” said he; “pray, what is your complaint?”\r\n “I am dropsical, sir,” she replied.  “Jesus! my dear mother, you say that\r\nas if it were nothing at all.--Does not such a complaint dismay you?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” she replied; “I am incomparably more dismayed at what I see\r\nhappening in our house.  For, indeed, I came hither to die here, but I\r\ndid not come to see all that I now see, and I had no reason to expect the\r\nkind of treatment we are having.  Sir, sir, this is man’s day; God’s day\r\nwill come, who will reveal many things and avenge everything.”  She died\r\non the 6th of August, 1661, murmuring over and over again, “Good by; good\r\nby!”  And, when she was asked why she said that, she replied simply,\r\n“Because I am going away, my children.”  She had given instructions to\r\nbury her in the preau (court-yard), and not to have any nonsense\r\n(_badineries_) after her death.  “I am your Jonas,” she said to the nuns;\r\n“when I am thrown into the whale’s belly the tempest will cease.”  She\r\nwas mistaken; the tempest was scarcely beginning.\r\n\r\nCardinal de Retz was still titular Archbishop of Paris, and rather\r\nfavorable to Jansenism.  It was, therefore, the grandvicars who prepared\r\nthe exhortation to the faithful, calling upon them to accept the papal\r\ndecision touching Jansen’s book.  There was drawn up a formula or\r\nformulary of adhesion, “turned with some skill,” says Madame Perier her\r\nbiography of Jacqueline Pascal, and in such a way that subscription did\r\nnot bind the conscience, as theologians most scrupulous about the truth\r\naffirmed; the nuns of Port-Royal, however, refused to subscribe.  “What\r\nhinders us,” said a letter to Mother Angelica de St. Jean from Jacqueline\r\nPascal, Sister St. Euphemia in religion, “what hinders all the\r\necclesiastics who recognize the truth, to reply, when the formulary is\r\npresented to them to subscribe, ‘I know the respect I owe the bishops,\r\nbut my conscience does not permit me to subscribe that a thing is in a\r\nbook in which I have not seen it,’ and after that wait for what will\r\nhappen?  What have we to fear?  Banishment and dispersion for the nuns,\r\nseizure of temporalities, imprisonment and death, if you will; but is not\r\nthat our glory, and should it not be our joy?  Let us renounce the gospel\r\nor follow the maxims of the gospel, and deem ourselves happy to suffer\r\nsomewhat for righteousness’ sake.  I know that it is not for daughters to\r\ndefend the truth, though one might say, unfortunately, that since the\r\nbishops have the courage of daughters, the daughters must have the\r\ncourage of bishops; but, if it is not for us to defend the truth, it is\r\nfor us to die for the truth, and suffer everything rather than abandon\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nJacqueline subscribed, divided between her instinctive repugnance and her\r\ndesire to show herself a “humble daughter of the Catholic church.”  “It\r\nis all we can concede,” she said; “for the rest, come what may, poverty,\r\ndispersion, imprisonment, death, all this seems to me nothing in\r\ncomparison with the anguish in which I should pass the remainder of my\r\nlife if I had been wretch enough to make a covenant with death on so\r\nexcellent an occasion of paying to God the vows of fidelity which our\r\nlips have pronounced.”  “Her health was so shaken by the shock which all\r\nthis business caused her,” writes Madame Prier, “that she fell\r\ndangerously ill, and died soon after.”  “Think not, I beg of you, my\r\nfather,” she wrote to M. Arnauld, “firm as I may appear, that nature does\r\nnot greatly apprehend all the consequences of this; but I hope that grace\r\nwill sustain me, and it seems to me as if I feel it.”  “The king does all\r\nhe wills,” Madame de Guemenee had said to M. Le Tellier, whom she was\r\ntrying to soften towards Port-Royal; “he makes princes of the blood, he\r\nmakes archbishops and bishops, and he will make martyrs likewise.”\r\n Jacqueline Pascal was “the first victim” of the formulary.\r\n\r\nShe was not the only one.  “It will not stop there,” said the king, to\r\nwhom it was announced that the daughters of Port-Royal consented to sign\r\nthe formulary on condition only of giving an explanation of their\r\nconduct.  Cardinal de Retz had at last sent in his resignation.  M. du\r\nMarca, archbishop designate in succession to him, died three days after\r\nreceiving the bulls from Rome; Hardouin de Porefix had just been\r\nnominated in his place.  He repaired to Port-Royal.  The days of grace\r\nwere over, the nuns remained indomitable.\r\n\r\n“What is the use of all your prayers?” said he to Sister Christine\r\nBrisquet; “what ground for God to listen to you?  You go to Him and say,\r\n‘My God, give me Thy spirit and Thy grace; but, my God, I do not mean to\r\nsubscribe; I will take good care not to do that for all that may be\r\nsaid.’  After that, what ground for God to hearken to you?”  He forbade\r\nthe nuns the sacraments.  “They are pure as angels and proud as demons,”\r\n repeated the archbishop angrily, as he left the convent.  On the 25th of\r\nAugust he returned to Port-Royal, accompanied by a numerous escort of\r\necclesiastics and exons.  “When I say a thing, so it must be,” he said as\r\nhe entered; “I will not eat my words.”  He picked out twelve nuns, who\r\nwere immediately taken away and dispersed in different monasteries.  M.\r\nd’Andilly was at the gate, receiving in his carriage his sister, Mother\r\nAgnes, aged and infirm, and his three daughters doomed to exile.  “I had\r\nborne up all day without weeping and without inclination thereto,” writes\r\nMother Angelica de St. Jean on arrival at the _Annonciades bleues;_ “but\r\nwhen night came, and, after finishing all my prayers, I thought to lay me\r\ndown and take some rest, I felt myself all in a moment bruised and\r\nlacerated in every part by the separations I had just gone through; I\r\nthen found sensibly that, to escape weakness in the hour of deep\r\naffliction, there must be no dropping of the eyes that have been lifted\r\nto the mountains.”  Ten months later the exiled nuns returned, without\r\nhaving subscribed, to Port-Royal des Champs, a little before the moment\r\nwhen M. de Saci, who had become their secret director since the death of\r\nM. Singlin, was arrested, together with his secretary, Fontaine, at six\r\nin the morning, in front of the Bastille.  “As he had for two years past\r\nbeen expecting imprisonment, he had got the epistles of St. Paul bound up\r\ntogether so as to always carry them about with him. ‘Let them do with me\r\nwhat they please,’ he was wont to say; ‘wherever they put me, provided\r\nthat I have my St. Paul with me, I fear nothing.’”  On the 13th of May,\r\n1666, the day of his arrest, M. de Saci had for once happened to forget\r\nhis book.  He was put into the Bastille, after an examination “which\r\nrevealed a man of much wit and worth,” said the king himself.  Fontaine\r\nremained separated from him for three months.  “Liberty, for me, is to be\r\nwith M. de Saci,” said the faithful secretary; “open the door of his room\r\nand that of the Bastille, and you will see to which of the two I shall\r\nrun.  Without him everything will be prison to me; I shall be free\r\nwherever I see him.”  At last he had the joy of recovering his\r\nwell-beloved master, strictly watched and still deprived of the\r\nsacraments.  Like Luther at Wartburg, he was finishing the revisal of his\r\ntranslation of the Bible, when his cousins, MM. de Pomponne and Arnauld,\r\nentered his room on the 31st of October, 1668.  They chatted a while\r\nwithout any appearance of impatience on the part of M. de Saci.  “You are\r\nfree,” said his friends at last, who had wanted to prove him; “and they\r\nshowed him the king’s order, which he read,” says Abbe Arnauld, “without\r\nany change of countenance, and as little affected by joy as he had been a\r\nmoment before by the longinquity of his release.”\r\n\r\nHe lived fifteen years longer, occupied, during the interval of rest\r\nwhich the Peace of the Church restored to Port-Royal, in directing and\r\nfortifying souls.  He published, one after another, the volumes of his\r\ntranslation of the Bible, with expositions (_eclaircissements_) which had\r\nbeen required by the examiners.  In 1679 the renewal of the king’s\r\nseverities compelled him to retire completely to Pomponne.  On the 3d of\r\nJanuary, 1684, at seventy-one years of age, he felt ill and went to bed;\r\nhe died next day, without being taken by surprise, as regarded either his\r\naffairs or his soul, by so speedy an end.  “O blessed flames of\r\npurgatory!” he said, as he breathed his last.  He had requested to be\r\nburied at Port-Royal des Champs; he was borne thither at night; the cold\r\nwas intense, and the roads were covered with snow; the carriages were\r\nescorted by men carrying torches.  The nuns looked a moment upon the face\r\nof the saintly director, whom they had not seen for so many years; and\r\nthen he was lowered into his grave.  “Needs hide in earth what is but\r\nearth,” said Mother Angelica de St. Jean, in deep accents and a lowly\r\nvoice, “and return to nothingness what in itself is but nothing.”  She\r\nwas, nevertheless, heart-broken, and tarried only for this pious duty to\r\npass away in her turn.  “It is time to give up my veil to him from whom I\r\nreceived it,” said she.  A fortnight after the death of M. de Saci, she\r\nexpired at Port-Royal, just preceding to the tomb her brother M. de\r\nLuzancy, who breathed his last at Pomponne, where he had lived with M. de\r\nSaci.  “I confess,” said the inconsolable Fontaine, “that when I saw this\r\nbrother and sister stricken with death by that of M. de Saci, I blushed--\r\nI who thought I had always loved him--not to follow him like them; and I\r\nbecame, consequently, exasperated with myself for loving so little in\r\ncomparison with those persons, whose love had been strong as death.”  The\r\nhuman heart avenges itself for the tortures men pretentiously inflict\r\nupon it: the disciples of St. Cyran thought to stifle in their souls all\r\nearthly affections, and they died of grief on losing those they loved.\r\n“Their life ebbed away in those depths of tears,” as M. Vinet has said.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abbey of Port-Royal----580]\r\n\r\nThe great Port-Royal was dead with M. de Saci and Mother Angelica de St.\r\nJean, faithful and modest imitators of their illustrious predecessors.\r\nThe austere virtue and the pious severance from the world existed still\r\nin the house in the Fields, under the direction of Duguet; the\r\npersecution too continued, persistent and noiseless; the king had given\r\nthe direction of his conscience to the Jesuits; from Father La Chaise,\r\nmoderate and prudent, he had passed to Father Letellier, violent and\r\nperfidious; furthermore, the long persistence of the Jansenists in their\r\nobstinacy, their freedom of thought which infringed the unity so dear to\r\nLouis XIV., displeased the monarch, absolute even in his hour of\r\nhumiliation and defeat.  The property of Port-Royal was seized, and\r\nCardinal de Noailles, well disposed at bottom towards the Jansenists, but\r\nso feeble in character that determination, disgusted him as if it were a\r\npersonal insult, ended by once more forbidding the nuns the sacraments;\r\nthe house in the Fields was surpressed, and its title merged in that of\r\nPort-Royal in Paris, for some time past replenished with submissive nuns.\r\nMadame de Chateau-Renaud, “the new abbess, went to take possession; the\r\ndaughters of Mother Angelica protested, but without violence, as she\r\nwould have done in their place.”  On the 29th of October, 1709, after\r\nprime, Father Letellier having told the king that Madame de Chateau-\r\nRenaud dared not to go to Port-Royal des Champs, being convinced that\r\nthose headstrong, disobedient, and rebellious daughters would laugh at\r\nthe king’s decree, and that, unless his Majesty would be pleased to give\r\nprecise orders to disperse them, it would never be possible to carry it\r\nout, the king, being pressed in this way, sent his orders to\r\nM. d’Argenson, lieutenant of police.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Reading the Decree  581]\r\n\r\nHe appeared at Port-Royal with a commissary and two exons.  He asked for\r\nthe prioress; she was at church: when service was over, he summoned all\r\nthe nuns; one, old and very paralytic, was missing.  “Let her be\r\nbrought,” said M. d’Argenson.  “His Majesty’s orders are,” he continued,\r\n“that you break up this assemblage, never to meet again.  It is your\r\ngeneral dispersal that I announce to you; you are allowed but three hours\r\nto break up.”  “We are ready to obey, sir,” said the mother-prioress;\r\n“half an hour is more than sufficient for us to say our last good by, and\r\ntake with us a breviary, a Bible, and our regulations.”  And when he\r\nasked her whither she meant to go, “Sir, the moment our community is\r\nbroken up and dispersed, it is indifferent to me in what place I may be\r\npersonally, since I hope to find God wherever I shall be.”  They got into\r\ncarriages, receiving one after another the farewell and blessing of the\r\nmother-prioress, who was the last to depart, remaining firm to the end\r\nthere were two and twenty, the youngest fifty years old; they all died in\r\nthe convents to which they were taken.  A seizure was at once made of all\r\npapers and books left in the cells; Cardinal Noailles did not interfere.\r\nM. de St. Cyran had depicted him by anticipation, when he said that the\r\nweak were more to be feared than the wicked.  He was complaining one day\r\nof his differences with his bishops.  “What can you expect, Monsignor?”\r\n laughingly said a lady well disposed to the Jansenists; “God is just; it\r\nis the stones of Port-Royal tumbling upon your head.”  The tombs were\r\ndestroyed; some coffins were carried to a distance, others left and\r\nprofaned; the plough passed over the ruins; the hatred of the enemies of\r\nPort-Royal was satiated.  A few of the faithful, preserving in their\r\nhearts the ardent faith of M. de St. Cyran, narrowed, however, and\r\nabsorbed by obstinate resistance, a few theologians dying in exile, and\r\nleaving in Holland a succession of bishops detached from the Roman\r\nchurch,--this was all that remained of one of the noblest attempts ever\r\nmade by the human soul to rise, here below, above that which is permitted\r\nby human nature.  Virtues of the utmost force, Christianity zealously\r\npushed to its extremest limits, and the most invincible courage,\r\nsustained the Jansenists in a conscientious struggle against spiritual\r\noppression; its life died out, little by little, amongst the dispersed\r\nmembers.  The Catholic church suffered therefrom in its innermost\r\nsanctuary.  “The Catholic religion would only be more neglected if there\r\nwere no more religionists,” said Vauban, in his Memoire in favor of the\r\nProtestants.  It was the same as regarded the Jansenists.  The Jesuits\r\nand Louis XIV., in their ignorant passion, for unity and uniformity, had\r\nnot comprehended that great principle of healthy freedom and sound\r\njustice of which the scientific soldier had a glimmering.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection of the Camisards, in the Cevennes, had been entirely of\r\na popular character; the Jansenists had penitents amongst the great of\r\nthis world, though none properly belonged to them or retired to their\r\nconvents or their solitudes; it was the great French burgessdom, issue\r\nfor the most part of the magistracy, which supplied their most fervent\r\nassociates.  Fenelon and Madame Guyon founded their little church at\r\ncourt and amongst the great lords; and many remained faithful to them\r\ntill death.  The spiritual letters of Fenelon, models of wisdom, pious\r\ntact, moderation, and knowledge of the human heart, are nearly all\r\naddressed to persons engaged in the life and the offices of the court,\r\nexposed to all the temptations of the world.  It is no longer the desert\r\nof the penitents of PortRoyal, or the strict cloister of Mother Angelica;\r\nFenelon is for only inward restrictions and an abstention purely\r\nspiritual; from afar and in his retreat at Cambrai, he watches over his\r\nfaithful flock with a tender pre-occupation which does not make him\r\noverlook the duties of their position.  “Take as penance for your sins,”\r\n he wrote, “the disagreeable liabilities of the position you are in: the\r\nvery hinderances which seem injurious to our advancement in piety turn to\r\nour profit, provided that we do what depends on ourselves.  Fail not in\r\nany of your duties towards the court, as regards your office and the\r\nproprieties, but be not anxious for posts which awaken ambition.”  Such\r\nare, with their discreet tolerance, the teachings of Fenelon, adapted for\r\nthe guidance of the Dukes of Beauvilliers and Chevreuse, and of the Duke\r\nof Burgundy himself.  He went much further, and on less safe a road, when\r\nhe was living at court, under the influence of Madame Guyon.  A widow and\r\nstill young, gifted with an ardent spirit and a lofty and subtile mind,\r\nMadame Guyon had imagined, in her mystical enthusiasm, a theory of pure\r\nlove, very analogous fundamentally, if not in its practical consequences,\r\nto the doctrines taught shortly before by a Spanish priest named Molinos,\r\ncondemned by the court of Rome in 1687.  It was about the same time that\r\nMadame Guyon went to Paris, with her book on the _Moyen court et facile\r\nde faire l’Oraison du Coeur_ (Short and easy Method of making Orison with\r\nthe Heart).  Prayer, according to this wholly mystical teaching, loses\r\nthe character of supplication or intercession, to become the simple\r\nsilence of a soul absorbed in God.  “Why are not simple folks so taught?”\r\n she said.  “Shepherds keeping their flocks would have the spirit of the\r\nold anchorites; and laborers, whilst driving the plough, would talk\r\nhappily with God: all vice would be banished in a little while, and the\r\nkingdom of God would be realized on earth.”\r\n\r\nIt was a far cry from the sanguinary struggle against sin and the armed\r\nChristianity of the Jansenists; the sublime and specious visions of\r\nMadame Guy on fascinated lofty and gentle souls: the Duchess of Charost,\r\ndaughter of Fouquet, Mesdames de Beauvilliers, de Chevreuse, de\r\nMortemart, daughters of Colbert, and their pious husbands, were the first\r\nto be chained to her feet.  Fenelon, at that time, preceptor to the\r\nchildren of France (royal family), saw her, admired her, and became\r\nimbued with her doctrines.  She was for a while admitted to the intimacy\r\nof Madame de Maintenon.  It was for this little nucleus of faithful\r\nfriends that she wrote her book of _Torrents_.  The human soul is a\r\ntorrent which returns to its source, in God, who lives in perfect repose,\r\nand who would fain give it to those who are His.  The Christian soul has\r\nnothing more that is its, neither will nor desire.  It has God for soul;\r\nHe is its principle of life.”  In this way there is nothing\r\nextraordinary.  No visions, no ecstasies, no entrancements.  The way is\r\nsimple, pure, and plain; there the soul sees nothing but in God, as God\r\nsees Himself and with His eyes.”  With less vagueness, and quite as\r\nmystically, Fenelon defined the sublime love taught by Madame Guyon in\r\nthe following maxim, afterwards condemned at Rome: “There is an habitual\r\nstate of love of God which is pure charity, without any taint of the\r\nmotive of self-interest.  Neither fear of punishment nor desire of reward\r\nhave any longer part in this love; God is loved not for the merit, or the\r\nperfection, or the happiness to be found in loving Him.”  What singular\r\nseductiveness in those theories of pure love which were taught at the\r\ncourt of Louis XIV., by his grandchildren’s preceptor, at a woman’s\r\ninstigation, and zealously preached fifty years afterwards by President\r\n(of New Jersey College) Jonathan Edwards, in the cold and austere\r\natmosphere of New England!\r\n\r\nLed away by the generous enthusiasm of his soul, Fenelon had not probed\r\nthe dangers of his new doctrine.  The gospel and church of Christ, whilst\r\npreaching the love of God, had strongly maintained the fact of human\r\nindividuality and responsibility.  The theory of mere (pure) love\r\nabsorbing the soul in God put an end to repentance, effort to withstand\r\nevil, and the need of a Redeemer.  Bossuet was not deceived.  The\r\nelevation of his mind, combined with strong common sense, caused him to\r\nsee through all the veils of the mysticism.  Madame Guyon had submitted\r\nher books to him; he disapproved of them, at first quietly, then\r\nformally, after a thorough examination in conjunction with two other\r\ndoctors.  Madame Guyon retired to a monastery of Meaux; she soon returned\r\nto Paris, and her believers rallied round her.  Bossuet, in his anger, no\r\nlonger held his hand.  Madame Guyon was shut up first at Vincennes, and\r\nthen in the Bastille; she remained seven years in prison, and ended by\r\nretiring to near Blois, where she died in 1717, still absorbed in her\r\nholy and vague reveries, praying no more inasmuch as she possessed God,\r\n“a submissive daughter, however, of the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman\r\nChurch, having and desiring to admit no other opinion but its,” as she\r\nsays in her will.  Bourdaloue calls mere (pure) love “a bare faith, which\r\nhas for its object no verity of the gospel’s, no mystery of Jesus\r\nChrist’s, no attribute of God’s, nothing whatever, unless it be, in a\r\nword, God.”  In the presence of death, on the approach of the awful\r\nrealities of eternity, Madame Guyon no doubt felt the want of a more\r\nsimple faith in the mighty and living God.  Fenelon had not waited so\r\nlong to surrender.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of the pious and vigorous souls of the seventeenth century\r\nhad not allowed them to go astray: there was little talk of pantheism,\r\nwhich had spread considerably in the sixteenth century; but there had\r\nbeen a presentiment of the dangers lurking behind the doctrines of Madame\r\nGuyon.  Bossuet, that great and noble type of the finest period of the\r\nCatholic church in France, made the mistake of pushing his victory too\r\nfar.  Fenelon, a young priest when the great Bishop of Meaux was already\r\nin his zenith, had preserved towards him a profound affection and a deep\r\nrespect.  “We are, by anticipation, agreed, however you may decide,” he\r\nwrote to him on the 28th of July, 1694: “it will be no specious\r\nsubmission, but a sincere conviction.  Though that which I suppose myself\r\nto have read should appear to me clearer than that two and two make four,\r\nI should consider it still less clear than my obligation to mistrust all\r\nmy lights, and to prefer before them those of a bishop such as you.  You\r\nhave only to give me my lesson in writing; provided that you wrote me\r\nprecisely what is the doctrine of the church, and what are the articles\r\nin which I have slipped, I would tie myself down inviolably to that\r\nrule.”  Bossuet required more; he wanted Fenelon, recently promoted to\r\nthe Archbishopric of Cambrai, to approve of the book he was preparing on\r\n_Etats d’Oraison_ (States of Orison), and explicitly to condemn the works\r\nof Madame Guyon.  Fenelon refused with generous indignation.  “So it is\r\nto secure my own reputation,” he writes to Madame de Maintenon, in 1696,\r\n“that I am wanted to subscribe that a lady, my friend, would plainly\r\ndeserve to be burned with all her writings, for an execrable form of\r\nspirituality, which is the only bond of our friendship?  I tell you,\r\nmadame, I would burn my friend with my own hands, and I would burn myself\r\njoyfully, rather than let the church be imperilled.  But here is a poor\r\ncaptive woman, overwhelmed with sorrows; there is none to defend her,\r\nnone to excuse her; they are always afraid to do so.  I maintain that\r\nthis stroke of the pen, given by me against my conscience, from a\r\ncowardly policy, would render me forever infamous, and unworthy of my\r\nministry and my position.”  Fenelon no longer submitted his reason and\r\nhis conduct, then, to the judgment of Bossuet; he recognized in him an\r\nadversary, but he still spoke of him with profound veneration.  “Fear\r\nnot,” he writes to Madame de Maintenon, “that I should gainsay M. de\r\nMeaux; I shall never speak of him but as of my master, and of his\r\npropositions but as the rule of faith.”  Fenelon was at Cambrai, being\r\nregular in the residence which removed him for nine months in the year\r\nfrom the court and the children of France, when there appeared his\r\n_Explication des Maximes des Saints sur la Vie Interieure_ (Exposition of\r\nthe Maxims of the Saints touching the Inner Life), almost at the same\r\nmoment as Bossuet’s _Instruction sur les Etats d’ Oraison_ (Lessons on\r\nStates of Orison).  Fenelon’s book appeared as dangerous as those of\r\nMadame Guyon; he himself submitted it to the pope, and was getting ready\r\nto repair to Rome to defend his cause, when the king wrote to him, “I do\r\nnot think proper to allow you to go to Rome; you must, on the contrary,\r\nrepair to your diocese, whence I forbid you to go away; you can send to\r\nRome your pleas in justification of your book.”\r\n\r\nFenelon departed to an exile which was to last as long as his life; on\r\nhis departure, he wrote to Madame de Maintenon, “I shall depart hence,\r\nmadame, to-morrow, Friday, in obedience to the king.  My greatest sorrow\r\nis to have wearied him and to displease him.  I shall not cease, all the\r\ndays of my life, to pray God to pour His graces upon him.  I consent to\r\nbe crushed more and more.  The only thing I ask of his Majesty is, that\r\nthe diocese of Cambrai, which is guiltless, may not suffer for the errors\r\nimputed to me.  I ask protection only for the sake of the church, and\r\neven that protection I limit to not being disturbed in those few good\r\nworks which my present position permits me to do, in order to fulfil a\r\npastor’s duties.  It remains for me, madame, only to ask your pardon for\r\nall the trouble I have caused you.  I shall all my life be as deeply\r\nsensible of your former kindnesses as if I had not forfeited them, and my\r\nrespectful attachment to yourself, madame, will never diminish.”\r\n\r\nFenelon made no mistake in addressing to Madame de Maintenon his farewell\r\nand his regrets; she had acted against him with the uneasiness of a\r\nperson led away for a moment by an irresistible attraction, and\r\nreturning, quite affrighted, to rule and the beaten paths.  The mere love\r\ntheory had no power to fascinate her for long.  The Archbishop of Cambrai\r\ndid not drop out of that pleasant dignity.  The pious councillors of the\r\nking were working against him at Rome, bringing all the influence of\r\nFrance to weigh upon Innocent XII.  Fenelon had taken no part in the\r\ndeclarations of the Gallican church, in 1682, which had been drawn up by\r\nBossuet; the court of Rome was inclined towards him; the strife became\r\nbitter and personal; pamphlets succeeded pamphlets, letters.  Bossuet\r\npublished a _Relation du Quietisme_ (An Account of Quietism), and remarks\r\nupon the reply of M. de Cambrai.  “I write this for the people,” he said,\r\n“in order that, the character of M. de Cambrai being known, his eloquence\r\nmay, with God’s permission, no more impose upon anybody.”  Fenelon\r\nreplied with a vigor, a fullness, and a moderation which brought men’s\r\nminds over to him.  “You do more for me by the excess of your\r\naccusations,” said he to Bossuet, “than I could do myself.  But what a\r\nmelancholy consolation when we look at the scandal which troubles the\r\nhouse of God, and which causes so many heretics and libertines (free-\r\nthinkers) to triumph!  Whatever end may be put by a holy pontiff to this\r\nmatter, I await it with impatience, having no wish but to obey, no fear\r\nbut to be in the wrong, no object but peace.  I hope that it will be seen\r\nfrom my silence, my unreserved submission, my constant horror of\r\nillusion, my isolation from any book and any person of a suspicious sort,\r\nthat the evil you would fain have caused to be apprehended is as\r\nchimerical as the scandal has been real, and that violent measures taken\r\nagainst imaginary evils turn to poison.”\r\n\r\nFenelon was condemned on the 12th of March, 1699; the sentence of Rome\r\nwas mild, and hinted no suspicion of heresy; it had been wrested from the\r\npope by the urgency of Louis XIV.  “It would be painful to his Majesty,”\r\n wrote the Bishop of Meaux in the king’s name, “to see a new schism\r\ngrowing up amongst his subjects at the very time that he is applying\r\nhimself with all his might to the task of extirpating that of Calvin, and\r\nif he saw the prolongation, by manoeuvres which are incomprehensible, of\r\na matter which appeared to be at an end.  He will know what he has to do,\r\nand will take suitable resolutions, still hoping, nevertheless, that his\r\nHoliness will not be pleased to reduce him to such disagreeable\r\nextremities.”  When the threat reached Rome, Innocent XII. had already\r\nyielded.\r\n\r\nFenelon submitted to the pope’s decision completely and unreservedly.\r\n“God gives me grace to be at peace amidst bitterness and sorrow,” he\r\nwrote to the Duke of Beauvilliers on the 29th of March, 1699.  “Amongst\r\nso many troubles I have one consolation little fitted to be known in the\r\nworld, but solid enough for those who seek God in good faith, and that\r\nis, that my conduct is quite decided upon, and that I have no longer to\r\ndeliberate.  It only remains for me to submit and hold my peace; that is\r\nwhat I have always desired.  I have now but to choose the terms of my\r\nsubmission; the shortest, the simplest, the most absolute, the most\r\ndevoid of any restriction, are those that I rather prefer.  My conscience\r\nis disburdened in that of my superior.  In all this, far from having an\r\neye to my advantage, I have no eye to any man; I see but God, and I am\r\ncontent with what He does.”\r\n\r\nBossuet had triumphed: his vaster mind, his more sagacious insight, his\r\nstronger judgment had unravelled the dangerous errors in which Fenelon\r\nhad allowed himself to be entangled.  The Archbishop of Cambrai, however,\r\nhad grown in the estimation of good men on account of his moderation, his\r\ngentle and high-spirited independence during the struggle, his\r\nsubmission, full of dignity, after the papal decision.  The mind of\r\nBossuet was the greater; the spirit of Fenelon was the nobler and more\r\ndeeply pious.  “I cannot consent to have my book defended even\r\nindirectly,” he wrote to one of his friends on the 21st of July, 1699.\r\n“In God’s name, speak not of me but to God only, and leave men to think\r\nas they please; as for me, I have no object but silence and peace after\r\nmy unreserved submission.”\r\n\r\nFenelon was not detached from the world and his hopes to quite such an\r\nextent as he would have had it appear.  He had educated the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, who remained passionately attached to him, and might hope for a\r\nreturn of prosperity.  He remained in the silence and retirement of his\r\ndiocese, with the character of an able and saintly bishop, keeping open\r\nhouse, grandly and simply, careful of the welfare of the soldiery who\r\npassed through Cambrai, adored by his clergy and the people.  “Never a\r\nword about the court, or about public affairs of any sort that could be\r\nfound fault with, or any that smacked the least in the world of baseness,\r\nregret, or flattery,” writes St.  Simon; “never anything that could give\r\na bare hint of what he had been or might be again.  He was a tall, thin\r\nman, well made, pale, with a large nose, eyes from which fire and\r\nintellect streamed like a torrent, and a physiognomy such that I have\r\nnever seen any like it, and there was no forgetting it when it had been\r\nseen but once.  It combined everything, and there was no conflict of\r\nopposites in it.  There were gravity and gallantry, the serious and the\r\ngay; it savored equally of the learned doctor, the bishop, and the great\r\nlord; that which appeared on its surface, as well as in his whole person,\r\nwas refinement, intellect, grace, propriety, and, above all, nobility.\r\nIt required an effort to cease looking at him.  His manners corresponded\r\ntherewith in the same proportion, with an ease which communicated it to\r\nothers; with all this, a man who never desired to show more wits than\r\nthey with whom he conversed, who put himself within everybody’s range\r\nwithout ever letting it be perceived, in such wise that nobody could drop\r\nhim, or fight shy of him, or not want to see him again.  It was this rare\r\ntalent, which he possessed to the highest degree, that kept his friends\r\nso completely attached to him all his life, in spite of his downfall, and\r\nthat, in their dispersion, brought them together to speak of him, to\r\nsorrow after him, to yearn for him, to bind themselves more and more to\r\nhim, as the Jews to Jerusalem, and to sigh after his return and hope\r\ncontinually for it, just as that unfortunate people still expects and\r\nsighs after the Messiah.”\r\n\r\nThose faithful friends were dropping one after another.  The death of the\r\nDuke of Burgundy and of the Duke of Chevreuse in 1712, and that of the\r\nDuke of Beauvilliers in 1714, were a fatal blow to the affections as well\r\nas to the ambitious hopes of Fenelon.  Of delicate health, worn out by\r\nthe manifold duties of the episcopate, inwardly wearied by long and vain\r\nexpectation, he succumbed on the 7th of January, 1715, at the moment when\r\nthe attraction shown by the Duke of Orleans towards him and “the king’s\r\ndeclining state” were once more renewing his chances of power.  “He was\r\nalready consulted in private and courted again in public,” says St.\r\nSimon, “because the inclination of the rising sun had already shown\r\nthrough.”  He died, however, without letting any sign of yearning for\r\nlife appear, “regardless of all that he was leaving, and occupied solely\r\nwith that which he was going to meet, with a tranquillity, a peace, which\r\nexcluded nothing but disquietude, and which included penitence,\r\ndespoilment, and a unique care for the spiritual affairs of his diocese.”\r\n The Christian soul was detaching itself from the world to go before God\r\nwith sweet and simple confidence.  “O, how great is God! how all in all!\r\nHow as nothing are we when we are so near Him, and when the veil which\r\nconceals Him from us is about to lift!” [_Euvres de Fenelon, Lettres\r\nSpirituelles,_ xxv. 128.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bossuet----591]\r\n\r\nSo many fires smouldering in the hearts, so many different struggles\r\ngoing on in the souls, that sought to manifest their personal and\r\nindependent life have often caused forgetfulness of the great mass of the\r\nfaithful who were neither Jansenists nor Quietists.  Bossuet was the real\r\nhead and the pride of the great Catholic church of France in the\r\nseventeenth century; what he approved of was approved of by the immense\r\nmajority of the French clergy, what he condemned was condemned by them.\r\nModerate and prudent in conduct as well as in his opinions, pious without\r\nbeing fervent, holding discreetly aloof from all excesses, he was a\r\nGallican without fear and without estrangement as regarded the papal\r\npower, to which he steadfastly paid homage.  It was with pain, and not\r\nwithout having sought to escape therefrom, that he found himself obliged,\r\nat the assembly of the clergy in 1682, to draw up the solemn declarations\r\nof the Gallican church.  The meeting of the clergy had been called forth\r\nby the eternal discussions of the civil power with the court of Rome on\r\nthe question of the rights of regale, that is to say, the rights of the\r\nsovereign to receive the revenues of vacant bishoprics, and to appoint to\r\nbenefices belonging to them.  The French bishops were of independent\r\nspirit; the Archbishop of Paris, Francis de Harlay, was on bad terms with\r\nPope Innocent XI.; Bossuet managed to moderate the discussions, and kept\r\nwithin suitable bounds the declaration which he could not avoid.  He had\r\nalways taught and maintained what was proclaimed by the assembly of the\r\nclergy of France, “that St.  Peter and his successors, vicars of Jesus\r\nChrist, and the whole church itself, received from God authority over\r\nonly spiritual matters and such as appertain to salvation, and not over\r\ntemporal and civil matters, in such sort that kings and sovereigns are\r\nnot subject to tiny ecclesiastical power, by order of God, in temporal\r\nmatters, and cannot be deposed directly or indirectly by authority of the\r\nkeys of the church; finally, that, though the pope has the principal part\r\nin questions of faith, and though his decrees concern all the churches\r\nand each church severally, his judgment is, nevertheless, not\r\nirrefragable, unless the consent of the church intervene.”  Old doctrines\r\nin the church of France, but never before so solemnly declared and made\r\nincumbent upon the teaching of all the faculties of theology in the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nConstantly occupied in the dogmatic struggle against Protestantism,\r\nBossuet had imported into it a moderation in form which, however, did not\r\nkeep out injustice.  Without any inclination towards persecution, he,\r\nwith almost unanimity on the part of the bishops of France, approved of\r\nthe king’s piety in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.  “Take up your\r\nsacred pens,” says he in his funeral oration over Michael Le Tellier,\r\n\r\n“ye who compose the annals of the church; haste ye to place Louis amongst\r\nthe peers of Constantine and Theodosius.  Our fathers saw not as we have\r\nseen an inveterate heresy falling at a single blow, scattered flocks\r\nreturning in a mass, and our churches too narrow to receive them, their\r\nfalse shepherds leaving them without even awaiting the order, and happy\r\nto have their banishment to allege as excuse; all tranquillity amidst so\r\ngreat a movement; the universe astounded to see in so novel an event the\r\nmost certain sign as well as the most noble use of authority, and the\r\nprince’s merit more recognized and more revered than even his authority.\r\nMoved by so many marvels, say ye to this new Constantine, this new\r\nTheodosius, this new Marciaau, this new Charlemagne, what the six hundred\r\nand thirty Fathers said aforetime in the council of Chaloedon, You have\r\nconfirmed the faith; you have exterminated the heretics; that is the\r\nworthy achievement of your reign, that is its own characteristic.\r\nThrough you heresy is no more.  God alone could have wrought this marvel.\r\nKing of heaven, preserve the king of earth; that is the prayer of the\r\nchurches, that is the prayer of the bishops.”  Bossuet, like Louis XIV.,\r\nbelieved Protestantism to be destroyed.  “Heresy is no more,” he said.\r\nIt was the same feeling that prompted Louis XIV., when dying, to the\r\nedict of March 8, 1715.  “We learn,” said he, “that, abjurations being\r\nfrequently made in provinces distant from those in which our newly\r\nconverted subjects die, our judges to whom those who die relapsed are\r\ndenounced find a difficulty in condemning them, for want of proof of\r\ntheir abjuration.  The stay which those who were of the religion styled\r\nReformed have made in our kingdom since we abolished therein all exercise\r\nof the said religion is a more than sufficient proof that they have\r\nembraced the Catholic religion, without which they would have been\r\nneither suffered nor tolerated.”  There did not exist, there could not\r\nexist, any more Protestants in France; all who died without sacraments\r\nwere relapsed, and as such dragged on the hurdle.  Those who were not\r\nmarried at a Catholic church were not married.  M. Guizot was born at\r\nNimes on the 4th of October, 1787, before Protestants possessed any civil\r\nrights in France.\r\n\r\nBossuet had died on the 12th of April, 1704.  When troubles began again\r\nin the church, the enemies of the Jansenists obtained from the king a\r\ndecree interdicting the _Reflexions morales cur le Nouveau Testament,_ an\r\nold and highly esteemed work by Father Quesnel, some time an Oratorian,\r\nwho had become head of the Jansenists on the death of the great Arnauld.\r\nIts condemnation at Rome was demanded.  Cardinal de Noailles, Archbishop\r\nof Paris, had but lately, as Bishop of Chalons, approved of the book; he\r\nrefused to retract his approbation; the Jesuits made urgent\r\nrepresentations to the pope; Clement XI. launched the bull _Unigenitus,_\r\ncondemning a hundred and one propositions extracted from the _Reflexions\r\nmorales_.  Eight prelates, with Cardinal de Noailles at their head,\r\nprotested against the bull; it was, nevertheless, enregistered at the\r\nParliament, but not without difficulty.  The archbishop still held out,\r\nsupported by the greater part of the religious orders and the majority of\r\nthe doctors of Sorbonne.  The king’s confessor, Letellier, pressed him to\r\nprosecute the cardinal and get him deposed by a national council; the\r\naffair dragged its slow length along at Rome; the archbishop had\r\nsuspended from the sacred functions all the Jesuits of his diocese; the\r\nstruggle had commenced under the name of Jansenism against the whole\r\nGallican church.  The king was about to bring the matter before his bed\r\nof justice, when he fell ill.  He saw no more of Cardinal de Noailles,\r\nand this rupture vexed him.  “I am sorry to leave the affairs of the\r\nchurch in the state in which they are,” he said to his councillors.  “I\r\nam perfectly ignorant in the matter; you know, and I call you to witness,\r\nthat I have done nothing therein but what you wanted, and that I have\r\ndone all you wanted.  It is you who will answer before God for all that\r\nhas been done, whether too much or too little.  I charge you with it\r\nbefore Him, and I have a clear conscience.  I am but a know-nothing who\r\nhave left myself to your guidance.”  An awful appeal from a dying king to\r\nthe guides of his conscience.  He had dispeopled his kingdom, reduced to\r\nexile, despair, or falsehood fifteen hundred thousand of his subjects,\r\nbut the memory of the persecutions inflicted upon the Protestants did not\r\ntrouble him; they were for him rather a pledge of his salvation and of\r\nhis acceptance before God.  He was thinking of the Catholic church, the\r\nholy priests exiled or imprisoned, the nuns driven from their convent,\r\nthe division among the bishops, the scandal amongst the faithful.  The\r\ngreat burden of absolute power was evident to his eyes; he sought to let\r\nit fall back upon the shoulders of those who had enticed him or urged him\r\nupon that fatal path.  A vain attempt in the eyes of men, whatever may be\r\nthe judgment of God’s sovereign mercy.  History has left weighing upon\r\nLouis XIV. the crushing weight of the religious persecutions ordered\r\nunder his reign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.----LOUIS XIV., LITERATURE AND ART.\r\n\r\nIt has been said in this History that Louis XIV. had the fortune to find\r\nhimself at the culminating point of absolute monarchy, and to profit by\r\nthe labors of his predecessors, reaping a portion of their glory; he had\r\nlikewise the honor of enriching himself with the labors of his\r\ncontemporaries, and attracting to himself a share of their lustre; the\r\nhonor, be it said, not the fortune, for he managed to remain the centre\r\nof intellectual movement as well as of the court, of literature and art\r\nas well as affairs of state.  Only the abrupt and solitary genius of\r\nPascal or the prankish and ingenuous geniality of La Fontaine held aloof\r\nfrom king and court; Racine and Moliere, Bossuet and Fenelon, La Bruyere\r\nand Boileau lived frequently in the circle of Louis XIV., and enjoyed in\r\ndifferent degrees his favor; M. de la Rochefoucauld and Madame de Sevigne\r\nwere of the court; Lebrun, Rigaud, Mignard, painted for the king;\r\nPerrault and Mansard constructed the Louvre and Versailles; the learned\r\nof all countries considered it an honor to correspond with the new\r\nacademies founded in France.  Louis XIV. was even less a man of letters\r\nor an artist than an administrator or a soldier; but literature and art,\r\nas well as the superintendents and the generals, found in him the King.\r\nThe puissant unity of the reign is everywhere the same.  The king and the\r\nnation are in harmony.\r\n\r\nPascal, had he been born later, would have remained independent and\r\nproud, from the nature of his mind and of his character as well as from\r\nthe connection he had full early with Port-Royal, where they did not rear\r\ncourtiers; he died, however, at thirty-nine, in 1661, the very year in\r\nwhich Louis XIV. began to govern.  Born at Clermont, in Auvergne,\r\neducated at his father’s and by his father, though it was not thought\r\ndesirable to let him study mathematics, he had already discovered by\r\nhimself the first thirty-two propositions of Euclid, when Cardinal\r\nRichelieu, holding on his knee little Jacqueline Pascal, and looking at\r\nher brother, said to M. Pascal, the two children’s father, who had come\r\nto thank him for a favor, “Take care of them; I mean to make something\r\ngreat of them.”  This was the native and powerful instinct of genius\r\ndivining genius; Richelieu, however, died three years later, without\r\nhaving done anything for the children who had impressed him beyond giving\r\ntheir father a share in the superintendence of Rouen; he thus put them in\r\nthe way of the great Corneille, who was affectionately kind to\r\nJacqueline, but took no particular notice of Blaise Pascal.  The latter\r\nwas seventeen; he had already written his _Traite des Coniques_ (Treatise\r\non Conics) and begun to occupy himself with “his arithmetical machine,”\r\n as his sister, Madame Perier calls it.  At twenty-three he had ceased to\r\napply his mind to human sciences; “when he afterwards discovered the\r\nroulette (cycloid), it was without thinking,” says Madame Perier, “and to\r\ndistract his attention from a severe tooth-ache he had.”  He was not\r\ntwenty-four when anxiety for his salvation and for the glory of God had\r\ntaken complete possession of his soul.  It was to the same end that he\r\ncomposed the _Lettres Provinciales,_ the first of which was written in\r\nsix days, and the style of which, clear, lively, precise, far removed\r\nfrom the somewhat solemn gravity of Port-Royal, formed French prose as\r\nMalherbe and Boileau formed the poetry.  This was the impression of his\r\ncontemporaries, the most hard of them to please in the art of writing.\r\n“That is excellent; that will be relished,” said the recluses of Port-\r\nRoyal, in spite of the misgivings of M. Singlin.  More than thirty years\r\nafter Pascal’s ddath, Madame de Sevigne, in 1689, wrote to Madame de\r\nGrignan, “Sometimes, to divert ourselves, we read the little Letters (to\r\na provincial).  Good heavens, how charming!  And how my son reads them!\r\nI always think of my daughter, and how that excess of correctness of\r\nreasoning would suit her; but your brother says that you consider that it\r\nis always the same thing over again.  Ah!  My goodness, so much the\r\nbetter!  Could any one have a more perfect style, a raillery more\r\nrefined, more natural, more delicate, worthier offspring of those\r\ndialogues of Plato, which are so fine?  And when, after the first ten\r\nletters, he addresses himself to the reverend Jesuit fathers, what\r\nearnestness, what solidity, what force!  What eloquence!  What love for\r\nGod and for the truth!  What a way of maintaining it and making it\r\nunderstood!  I am sure that you have never read them but in a hurry,\r\npitching on the pleasant places; but it is not so when they are read at\r\nleisure.”  Lord Macaulay once said to M. Guizot, “Amongst modern works I\r\nknow only two perfect ones, to which there is no exception to be taken,\r\nand they are _Pascal’s Provincials_ and the _Letters of Madame de\r\nSevigne_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Blaise Pascal----597]\r\n\r\nBoileau was of Lord Macaulay’s opinion; at least as regarded Pascal.\r\n“Corbinelli wrote to me the other day,” says Madame de Sevigne, on the\r\n15th of January, 1690: “he gave me an account of a conversation and a\r\ndinner at M. de Lamoignon’s: the persons were the master and mistress of\r\nthe house, M. de Troyes, M. de Toulon, Father Bourdaloue, a comrade of\r\nhis, Desprdaux, and Corbinelli.  The talk was of ancient and modern\r\nworks.  Despreaux supported the ancient, with the exception of one single\r\nmodern, which surpassed, in his opinion, both old and new.  Bourdaloue’s\r\ncomrade, who assumed the well-read air, and who had fastened on to\r\nDespreaux and Corbinelli, asked him what in the world this book could be\r\nthat was so remarkably clever.  Despreaux would not give the name.\r\nCorbinelli said to him, ‘Sir, I conjure you to tell me, that I may read\r\nit all night.’  Despreaux answered, laughing, ‘Ah! sir, you have read it\r\nmore than once, I am sure.’  The Jesuit joins in, with a disdainful air,\r\nand presses Despreaux to name this marvellous writer.  ‘Do not press me,\r\nfather,’ says Despreaux.  The father persists.  At last Despreaux takes\r\nhold of his arm, and squeezing it very hard, says, ‘You will have it,\r\nfather; well, then, egad! it is Pascal.’  ‘Pascal,’ says the father, all\r\nblushes and astonishment; ‘Pascal is as beautiful as the false can be.’\r\n‘False,’ replied Despreaux: ‘false! Let me tell you that he is as true as\r\nhe is inimitable; he has just been translated into three languages.’  The\r\nfather rejoined, ‘He is none the more true for that.’ Despreaux grew\r\nwarm, and shouted like a madman: ‘Well, father, will you say that one of\r\nyours did not have it printed in one of his books that a Christian was\r\nnot obliged to love God?  Dare you say that that is false?’  ‘Sir,’ said\r\nthe father, in a fury, ‘we must distinguish.’  ‘Distinguish!’ cried\r\nDespreaux; ‘distinguish, egad! distinguish!  Distinguish whether we are\r\nobliged to love God!’  And, taking Corbinelli by the arm, he flew off to\r\nthe other end of the room, coming back again, and rushing about like a\r\nlunatic; but he would not go near the father any more, and went off to\r\njoin the rest of the company.  Here endeth the story; the curtain falls.”\r\n Literary taste and religious sympathies combined, in the case of Boileau,\r\nto exalt Pascal.\r\n\r\nThe provincials could not satisfy for long the pious ardor of Pascal’s\r\nsoul; he took in hand his great work on the _Verite de la Religion_.\r\nHe had taken a vigorous part in the discussions of Port-Royal as to\r\nsubscription of the formulary: his opinion was decidedly in favor of\r\nresistance.  It was the moment when MM. Arnauld and Nicole had discovered\r\na restriction, as it was then called, which allowed of subscribing with a\r\nsafe conscience.  “M. Pascal, who loved truth above all things,” writes\r\nhis niece, Marguerite Perier; “who, moreover, was pulled down by a pain\r\nin the head, which never left him; who had exerted himself to make them\r\nfeel as he himself felt; and who had expressed himself very vigorously in\r\nspite of his weakness, was so grief-stricken that he had a fit, and lost\r\nspeech and consciousness.  Everybody was alarmed.  Exertions were made to\r\nbring him round, and then those gentlemen withdrew.  When he was quite\r\nrecovered, Madame Perier asked him what had caused this incident.  He\r\nanswered, ‘When I saw all those persons that I looked upon as being those\r\nwhom God had made to know the truth, and who ought to be its defenders,\r\nwavering and falling.  I declare to you that I was so overcome with grief\r\nthat I was unable to support it, and could not help breaking down.’”\r\n Blaise Pascal was the worthy brother of Jacqueline; in the former, as\r\nwell as the latter, the soul was too ardent and too strong for its\r\ncovering of body.  Nearly all his relatives died young.  “I alone am\r\nleft,” wrote Mdlle. Perier, when she had become, exceptionally, very\r\naged.  “I might say, like Simon Maccabeus, the last of all his brethren,\r\nAll my relatives and all my brethren are dead in the service of God and\r\nin the love of truth.  I alone am left; please God I may never have a\r\nthought of backsliding!”\r\n\r\nPascal was unable to finish his work.  “God, who had inspired my brother\r\nwith this design and with all his thoughts,” writes his sister, “did not\r\npermit him to bring it to its completion, for reasons to us unknown.”\r\n The last years of Pascal’s life, invalid as he had been from the age of\r\neighteen, were one long and continual torture, accepted and supported\r\nwith an austere disdain of suffering.  Incapable of any application, he\r\ngave his attention solely to his salvation and the care of the poor.\r\n“I have taken it into my head,” says he, “to have in the house a sick\r\npauper, to whom the same service shall be rendered as to myself;\r\nparticular attention to be paid to him, and, in fact, no difference to be\r\nmade between him and me, in order that I may have the consolation of\r\nknowing that there is one pauper as well treated as myself, in the\r\nperplexity I suffer from finding myself in the great affluence of every\r\nsort in which I do find myself.”  The spirit of M. de St. Cyran is there,\r\nand also the spirit of the gospel, which caused Pascal, when he was\r\ndying, to say, “I love poverty, because Jesus Christ loved it.  I love\r\nwealth, because it gives the means of assisting the needy.”  A genius\r\nunique in the extent and variety of his faculties, which were applied\r\nwith the same splendid results to mathematics and physics, to philosophy\r\nand polemics, disdaining all preconceived ideas, going unerringly and\r\nstraightforwardly to the bottom of things with admirable force and\r\nprofundity, independent and free even in his voluntary submission to the\r\nChristian faith, which he accepts with his eyes open, after having\r\nweighed it, measured it, and sounded it to its uttermost depths, too\r\nsteadfast and too simple not to bow his head before mysteries, all the\r\nwhile acknowledging his ignorance.  “If there were no darkness,” says he,\r\n“man would not feel his corruption; if there were no light, man would\r\nhave no hope of remedy.  Thus it is not only quite right, but useful, for\r\nus that God should be concealed in part, and revealed in part, since it\r\nis equally dangerous for man to know God without knowing his own misery,\r\nand to know his own misery without knowing God.”  The lights of this\r\ngreat intellect had led him to acquiesce in his own fogs.  “One can be\r\nquite sure that there is a God, without knowing what He is,” says he.\r\n\r\nIn 1627, four years after Pascal, and, like him, in a family of the long\r\nrobe, was born, at Dijon, his only rival in that great art of writing\r\nprose which established the superiority of the French language.  At\r\nsixteen, Bossuet preached his first sermon in the drawing-room of Madame\r\nde Rambouillet, and the great Conde was pleased to attend his theological\r\nexaminations.  He was already famous at court as a preacher and a\r\npolemist when the king gave him the title of Bishop of Condom, almost\r\nimmediately inviting him to become preceptor to the dauphin.  A difficult\r\nand an irksome task for him who had already written for Turenne an\r\nexposition of the Catholic faith, and had delivered the funeral orations\r\nover Madame Henriette and the Queen of England.  “The king has greatly at\r\nheart the dauphin’s education,” wrote Father Lacoue to Colbert; “he\r\nregards it as one of his grand state-strokes in respect of the future.”\r\n The dauphin was not devoid of intelligence.  “Monseigneur has plenty of\r\nwits,” said Councillor Le Gout de Saint-Seine in his private journal,\r\n“but his wits are under a bushel.”  The boy was indolent, with little\r\ninclination for work, roughly treated by his governor, the Duke of\r\nMontausier, who was endowed with more virtue than ability in the\r\nsuperintendence of a prince’s education.  “O,” cried Monseigneur, when\r\nofficial announcement was made to him of the project of marriage which\r\nthe king was conducting for him with the Princess Christine of Bavaria,\r\n“we shall see whether M. Huet (afterwards bishop of Avranches) will want\r\nto make me learn ancient geography any more!”  Bossuet had better\r\nunderstood what ought to be the aim of a king’s education.  “Remember,\r\nMonseigneur,” he constantly repeated to him, “that destined as you are to\r\nreign some day over this great kingdom, you are bound to make it happy.”\r\n He was in despair at his pupil’s inattention.  “There is a great deal to\r\nendure with a mind so destitute of application,” he wrote to Marshal\r\nBellefonds; “there is no perceptible relief, and we go on, as St. Paul\r\nsays, hoping against hope.”  He had written a little treatise on\r\ninattention, _De Incogitantia,_--in the vain hope of thus rousing his\r\npupil to work.  “I dread nothing in the world so much,” Louis XIV would\r\nsay, “as to have a sluggard (_faineant_) dauphin; I would much prefer to\r\nhave no son at all!”  Bossuet foresaw the innumerable obstacles in the\r\nway of his labors.  “I perceive, as I think,” he wrote to his friends,\r\n“in the dauphin the beginnings of great graces, a simplicity, a\r\nstraightforwardness, a principle of goodness, an attention, amidst all\r\nhis flightiness, to the mysteries, a something or other which comes with\r\na flash, in the middle of his distractions, to call him back to God.  You\r\nwould be charmed if I were to tell you the questions he puts to me, and\r\nthe desire he shows to be a good servant of God.  But the world! the\r\nworld! the world! pleasures, evil counsels, evil examples!  Save us,\r\nLord! save us!  Thou didst verily preserve the children from the furnace,\r\nbut Thou didst send Thine angel; and, as for me, alas! what am I?\r\nHumility, trepidation, absorption into one’s own nothingness!”\r\n\r\nIt was not for Bossuet that the honor was reserved of succeeding in the\r\ndifficult task of a royal education.  Fenelon encountered in the Duke of\r\nBurgundy a more undisciplined nature, a more violent character, and more\r\ndangerous tendencies than Bossuet had to fight against in the\r\ngrand-dauphin; but there was a richer mind and a warmer heart; the\r\npreceptor, too, was more proper for the work.  Bossuet, nevertheless,\r\nlabored conscientiously to instruct his little prince, studying for him\r\nand with him the classical authors, preparing grammatical expositions,\r\nand, lastly, writing for his edification the _Traite de la Connaissance\r\nde Dieu et de soi-mime_ (Treatise on the Knowledge of God and of Self),\r\nthe _Discours sur l’Histoire Universelle_ (Discourse on Universal\r\nHistory), and the _Politique tiree de l’Ecriture Sainte_ (Polity derived\r\nfrom Holy Writ).  The labor was in vain; the very loftiness of his\r\ngenius, the extent and profundity of his views, rendered Bossuet unfit to\r\nget at the heart and mind of a boy who was timid, idle, and kept in fear\r\nby the king as well as by his governor.  The dauphin was nineteen when\r\nhis marriage restored Bossuet to the church and to the world; the king\r\nappointed him almoner to the dauphiness, and, before long, Bishop of\r\nMeaux.\r\n\r\nNeither the assembly of the clergy and the part he played therein, nor\r\nhis frequent preachings at court, diverted Bossuet from his duties as\r\nbishop; he habitually resided at Meaux, in the midst of his priests.  The\r\ngreater number of his sermons, written at first in fragments, collected\r\nfrom memory in their aggregate, and repeated frequently with divergences\r\nin wording and development, were preached in the cathedral of Meaux.  The\r\ndauphin sometimes went thither to see him.  “Pray, sir,” he had said to\r\nhim, in his childhood, “take great care of me whilst I am little; I will\r\nof you when I am big.”  Assured of his righteousness as a priest and his\r\nfine tact as a man, the king appealed to Bossuet in the delicate\r\nconjunctures of his life.  It is related that it was the Bishop of Meaux\r\nwho dissuaded him from making public his marriage with Madame de\r\nMaintenon.  She, more anxious for power than splendor, did not bear him\r\nany ill-will for it; amidst the various leanings of the court, divided as\r\nit was between Jansenism and Quietism, it was to the simple teaching of\r\nthe Catholic church, represented by Bossuet, that she remained\r\npractically attached.  Right-minded and strong-minded, but a little\r\ncold-hearted, Madame de Maintenon could not suffer herself to be led away\r\nby the sublime excesses of the Jansenists or the pious reveries of Madame\r\nGuyon; the Jesuits had influence over her, without her being a slave to\r\nthem; and that influence increased after the death of Bossuet.  The\r\nguidance of the Bishop of Meaux, in fact, answered the requirements of\r\nspirits that were pious and earnest without enthusiasm: less ardent in\r\nfaith and less absolute in religious practice than M. de St. Cyran and\r\nPort-Royal, less exacting in his demands than Father Bourdaloue,\r\nsusceptible now and then of mystic ideas, as is proved by his letters to\r\nSister Cornuau, he did not let himself be won by the vague ecstasies of\r\nabsolute (pure) love; he had a mind large enough to say, like Mother\r\nAngelica Arnauld, “I am of all saints’ order, and all saints are of my\r\norder; “but his preferences always inclined towards those saints and\r\nlearned doctors who had not carried any religious tendency to excess, and\r\nwho had known how to rest content with the spirit of a rule and a faith\r\nthat were practical.  A wonderful genius, discovering by flashes, and as\r\nif by instinct, the most profound truths of human nature, and giving them\r\nexpression in an incomparable style, forcing, straining the language to\r\nmake it render his idea, darting at one bound to the sublimest height by\r\nuse of the simplest terms, which he, so to speak, bore away with him,\r\nwresting them from their natural and proper signification.  “There, in\r\nspite of that great heart of hers, is that princess so admired and so\r\nbeloved; there, such as Death has made her for us!”  Bossuet alone could\r\nspeak like that.\r\n\r\nHe was writing incessantly, all the while that he was preaching at Meaux\r\nand at Paris, making funeral orations over the queen, Maria Theresa, over\r\nthe Princess Palatine, Michael Le Tellier, and the Prince of Conde.  The\r\nEdict of Nantes had just been revoked; controversy with the Protestant\r\nministers, headed by Claude and Jurieu, occupied a great space in the\r\nlife of the Bishop of Meaux.  He at that time wrote his _Histoire des\r\nVariations,_ often unjust and violent, always able in its attacks upon\r\nthe Reformation; he did not import any zeal into persecution, though all\r\nthe while admitting unreservedly the doctrines universally propagated\r\namongst Catholics.  “I declare,” he wrote to M. de Baville, “that I am\r\nand have always been of opinion, first, that princes may by penal laws\r\nconstrain all heretics to conform to the profession and practices of the\r\nCatholic church; secondly, that this doctrine ought to be held invariable\r\nin the church, which has not only conformed to, but has even demanded,\r\nsimilar ordinances from princes.”  He at the same time opposed the\r\nconstraint put upon the new converts to oblige them to go to mass,\r\nwithout requiring from them any other act of religion.\r\n\r\n“When the emperors imposed a like obligation on the Donatists,” he wrote\r\nto the Bishop of Mirepoix, “it was on the supposition that they were\r\nconverted, or would be; but the heretics at the present time, who declare\r\nthemselves by not fulfilling their Easter (communicating), ought to be\r\nrather hindered from assisting at the mysteries than constrained thereto,\r\nand the more so in that it appears to be a consequence thereof to\r\nconstrain them likewise to fulfil their Easter, which is expressly to\r\ngive occasion for frightful sacrilege.  They might be constrained to\r\nundergo instruction; but, so far as I can learn, that would hardly\r\nadvance matters, and I think that we must be reduced to three things; one\r\nis, to oblige them to send their children to the schools, or, in default,\r\nto find means of taking them out of their hands; another is, to be firm\r\nas regards marriages; and the last is, to take great pains to become\r\nprivately acquainted with those of whom there are good hopes, and to\r\nprocure for them solid instruction and veritable enlightenment; the rest\r\nmust be left to time and to the grace of God.  I know of nothing else.”\r\n About the same time Fenelon, engaged upon the missions in Poitou, being\r\nas much convinced as the Bishop of Meaux of a sovereign’s rights over the\r\nconscience of the faithful, as well as of the terrible danger of\r\nhypocrisy, wrote to Bossuet, telling him that he had demanded the\r\nwithdrawal of the troops in all the districts he was visiting: “It is no\r\nlight matter to change the sentiments of a whole people.  What difficulty\r\nmust the apostles have found in changing the face of the universe,\r\novercoming all passions, and establishing a doctrine till then unheard\r\nof, seeing that we cannot persuade the ignorant by clear and express\r\npassages which they read every day in favor of the religion of their\r\nancestors, and that the king’s own authority stirs up every passion to\r\nrender persuasion more easy for us!  The remnants of this sect go on\r\nsinking little by little, as regards all exterior observance, into a\r\nreligious indifference which cannot but cause fear and trembling.  If one\r\nwanted to make them abjure Christianity and follow the Koran, there would\r\nbe nothing required but to show them the dragoons; provided that they\r\nassemble by night, and withstand all instruction, they consider that they\r\nhave done enough.”  Cardinal Noailles was of the same mind as Bossuet and\r\nFEnelon.  “The king will be pained to decide against your opinion as\r\nregards the new converts,” says a letter to him from Madame de Maintenon;\r\n“meanwhile the most general is to force them to attend at mass.  Your\r\nopinion seems to be a condemnation of all that has been hitherto done\r\nagainst these poor creatures.  It is not pleasant to hark back so far,\r\nand it has always been supposed that, in any case, they must have a\r\nreligion.”  In vain were liberty of conscience and its inviolable rights\r\nstill misunderstood by the noblest spirits, the sincerity and\r\nhigh-mindedness of the great bishops instinctively revolted against\r\nthe hypocrisy engendered of persecution.  The tacit assuagement of the\r\nseverities against the Reformers, between 1688 and 1700, was the fruit of\r\nthe representations of Bossuet, Fenelon, and Cardinal Noailles.  Madame\r\nde Maintenon wrote at that date to one of her relatives, “You are\r\nconverted; do not meddle in the conversion of others.  I confess to you\r\nthat I do not like the idea of answering before God and the king for all\r\nthose conversions.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time with the controversial treatises, the _Elevations sur\r\nles Mysteres_ and the _Meditations sur l’Evangile_ were written at Meaux,\r\ndrawing the bishop away to the serener regions of supreme faith.  There\r\nmight he have chanced to meet those Reformers, as determined as he in the\r\nstrife, as attached, at bottom, as he, for life and death, to the\r\nmysteries and to the lights of a common hope.  “When God shall give us\r\ngrace to enter Paradise,” St. Bernard used to say, “we shall be above all\r\nastonished at not finding some of those whom we had thought to meet\r\nthere, and at finding others whom we did not expect.”  Bossuet had a\r\nmoments glimpse of this higher truth; in concert with Leibnitz, a great\r\nintellect of more range in knowledge and less steadfastness than he in\r\nreligious faith, he tried to reconcile the Catholic and Protestant\r\ncommunions in one and the same creed.  There were insurmountable\r\ndifficulties on both sides; the attempt remained unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Meaux had lately triumphed in the matter of Quietism,\r\nbreaking the ties of old friendship with Fenelon, and more concerned\r\nabout defending sound doctrine in the church than fearful of hurting his\r\nfriend, who was sincere and modest in his relations with him, and humbly\r\nsubmissive to the decrees of the court of Rome.  The Archbishop of\r\nCambrai was in exile at his own diocese; Bossuet was ill at Meaux, still,\r\nhowever, at work, going deeper every day into that profound study of Holy\r\nWrit and of the fathers of the church which shines forth in all his\r\nwritings.  He had stone, and suffered agonies, but would not permit an\r\noperation.  On his death-bed, surrounded by his nephews and his vicars,\r\nhe rejected with disdain all eulogies on his episcopal life.  “Speak to\r\nme of necessary truths,” said he, preserving to the last the simplicity\r\nof a great and strong mind, accustomed to turn from appearances and\r\nsecondary doctrines to embrace the mighty realities of time and of\r\neternity.  He died at Paris on the 12th of April, 1704, just when the\r\ntroubles of the church were springing up again.  Great was the\r\nconsternation amongst the bishops of France, wont as they were to shape\r\nthemselves by his counsels.  “Men were astounded at this mortal’s\r\nmortality.”  Bossuet was seventy-three.\r\n\r\nA month later, on the 13th of May, Father Bourdaloue in his turn died.\r\nA model of close logic and moral austerity, with a stiff and manly\r\neloquence, so impressed with the miserable insufficiency of human\r\nefforts, that he said as he was dying, “My God, I have wasted life; it is\r\njust that Thou recall it.”  There remained only Fenelon in the first\r\nrank, which Massillon did not as yet dispute with him.  Malebranche was\r\nliving retired in his cell at the Oratory, seldom speaking, writing his\r\n_Recherches sur la Verite_ (Researches into Truth), and his _Entretiens\r\nsur la Metaphysique_ (Discourses on Metaphysics), bolder in thought than\r\nhe was aware of or wished, sincere and natural in his meditations as well\r\nas in his style.  In spite of Flechier’s eloquence in certain funeral\r\norations, posterity has decided against the modesty of the Archbishop of\r\nCambrai, who said at the death of the Bishop of Nimes, in 1710, “We have\r\nlost our master.”  In his retirement or his exile, after Bossuet’s death,\r\nit was around Fenelon that was concentrated all the lustre of the French\r\nepiscopate, long since restored to the respect and admiration it\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nFenelon was born in Perigord, at the castle of Fenelon, on the 6th of\r\nAugust, 1651.  Like Cardinal Retz he belonged to an ancient and noble\r\nhouse, and was destined from his youth for the church.  Brought up at the\r\nseminary of St. Sulpice, lately founded by M. Olier, he for a short time\r\nconceived the idea of devoting himself to foreign missions; his weak\r\nhealth and his family’s opposition turned him ere long from his purpose,\r\nbut the preaching of the gospel amongst the heathen continued to have for\r\nhim an attractionn which is perfectly depicted in one of the rare sermons\r\nof his which have been preserved.  He had held himself modestly aloof,\r\noccupied with confirming new Catholics in their conversion or with\r\npreaching to the Protestants of Poitou; he had written nothing but his\r\n_Traite de l’Education des Filles,_ intended for the family of the Duke\r\nof Beauvilliers, and a book on the _ministere du pasteur_.  He was in bad\r\nodor with Harlay, Archbishop of Paris, who had said to him curtly one\r\nday, “You want to escape notice, M. Abbe, and you will;” nevertheless,\r\nwhen Louis XIV. chose the Duke of Beauvilliers as governor to his\r\ngrandson, the Duke of Burgundy, the duke at once called Fenelon, then\r\nthirty-eight years of age, to the important post of preceptor.\r\n\r\nWhereas the grand-dauphin, endowed with ordinary intelligence, was\r\nindolent and feeble, his son was, in the same proportion, violent, fiery,\r\nindomitable.  “The Duke of Burgundy,” says St. Simon, “was a born demon\r\n(_naquit terrible_), and in his early youth caused fear and trembling.\r\nHarsh, passionate, even to the last degree of rage against inanimate\r\nthings, madly impetuous, unable to bear the least opposition, even from\r\nthe hours and the elements, without flying into furies enough to make you\r\nfear that everything inside him would burst; obstinate to excess,\r\npassionately fond of all pleasures, of good living, of the chase madly,\r\nof music with a sort of transport, and of play too, in which he could not\r\nbear to lose; often ferocious, naturally inclined to cruelty, savage in\r\nraillery, taking off absurdities with a patness which was killing; from\r\nthe height of the clouds he regarded men as but atoms to whom he bore no\r\nresemblance, whoever they might be.  Barely did the princes his brothers\r\nappear to him intermediary between himself and the human race, although\r\nthere had always been an affectation of bringing them all three up in\r\nperfect equality; wits, penetration, flashed from every part of him, even\r\nin his transports; his repartees were astounding, his replies always went\r\nto the point and deep down, even in his mad fits; he made child’s play of\r\nthe most abstract sciences; the extent and vivacity of his wits were\r\nprodigious, and hindered him from applying himself to one thing at a\r\ntime, so far as to render him incapable of it.”\r\n\r\nAs a sincere Christian and a priest, Fenelon saw from the first that\r\nreligion alone could triumph over this terrible nature; the Duke of\r\nBeauvilliers, as sincere and as christianly as he, without much wits,\r\nmodestly allowed himself to be led; all the motives that act most\r\npowerfully on a generous spirit, honor, confidence, fear and love of\r\nGod, were employed one after the other to bring the prince into\r\nself-subjection.  He was but eight years old, and Fenelon had been only\r\na few months with him, when the child put into his hands one day the\r\nfollowing engagement:--\r\n\r\n“I promise M. l’Abbe de Fenelon, on the honor of a prince, to do at once\r\nwhatever he bids me, and to obey him the instant he orders me anything,\r\nand, if I fail to, I will submit to any kind of punishment and disgrace.”\r\n\r\n“Done at Versailles the 29th of November, 1689.\r\n“Signed: Louis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fenelon and the Duke of Burgundy----610]\r\n\r\nThe child, however, would forget himself, and relapse into his mad fits.\r\nWhen his preceptor was chiding him one day for a grave fault, he went so\r\nfar as to say, “No, no, sir; I know who I am and what you are.”  Fenelon\r\nmade no reply; coldly and gravely he allowed the day to close and the\r\nnight to pass without showing his pupil any sign of either resentment or\r\naffection.  Next day the Duke of Burgundy was scarcely awake when his\r\npreceptor entered the room.  “I do not know, sir,” said he, “whether you\r\nremember what you said to me yesterday, that you know what you are and\r\nwhat I am.  It is my duty to teach you that you do not know either one or\r\nthe other.  You fancy yourself, sir, to be more than I; some lackeys, no\r\ndoubt, have told you so, but I am not afraid to tell you, since you force\r\nme to it, that I am more than you.  You have sense enough to understand\r\nthat there is no question here of birth.  You would consider anybody out\r\nof his wits who pretended to make a merit of it that the rain of heaven\r\nhad fertilized his crops without moistening his neighbors.  You would be\r\nno wiser if you were disposed to be vain of your birth, which adds\r\nnothing to your personal merit.  You cannot doubt that I am above you in\r\nlights and knowledge.  You know nothing but what I have taught you; and\r\nwhat I have taught you is nothing compared with what I might still teach\r\nyou.  As for authority, you have none over me; and I, on the contrary,\r\nhave it fully and entirely over you; the king and Monseigneur have told\r\nyou so often enough.  You fancy, perhaps, that I think myself very\r\nfortunate to hold the office I discharge towards you; disabuse yourself\r\nonce more, sir; I only took it in order to obey the king and give\r\npleasure to Monseigneur, and not at all for the painful privilege of\r\nbeing your preceptor; and, that you may have no doubt about it, I am\r\ngoing to take you to his Majesty, and beg him to get you another one,\r\nwhose pains I hope may be more successful than mine.”  The Duke of\r\nBurgundy’s passion was past, and he burst into sobs.  “Ah! sir,” he\r\ncried, “I am in despair at what took place yesterday; if you speak to\r\nthe king, you will lose me his affection; if you leave me, what will be\r\nthought of me?  I promise you.  I promise you .  .  .  that you shall be\r\nsatisfied with me; but promise me .  .  .”\r\n\r\nFenelon promised nothing; he remained, and the foundation of his\r\nauthority was laid forever in the soul of his pupil.  The young prince\r\ndid not forget what he was, but he had felt the superiority of his\r\nmaster.  “I leave the Duke of Burgundy behind the door,” he was\r\naccustomed to say, “and with you I am only little Louis.”\r\n\r\nGod, at the same time with Fenelon, had taken possession of the Duke of\r\nBurgundy’s soul.  “After his first communion, we saw disappearing little\r\nby little all the faults which, in his infancy, caused us great\r\nmisgivings as to the future,” writes Madame de Maintenon.  “His piety has\r\ncaused such a metamorphosis that, from the passionate thing he was, he\r\nhas become self-restrained, gentle, complaisant; one would say that that\r\nwas his character, and that virtue was natural to him.”  “All his mad\r\nfits and spites yielded at the bare name of God,” Fenelon used to say;\r\n“one day when he was in a very bad temper, and wanted to hide in his\r\npassion what he had done in his disobedience, I pressed him to tell me\r\nthe truth before God; then he put himself into a great rage and bawled,\r\n‘Why ask me before God?  Very well, then, as you ask me in that way, I\r\ncannot deny that I committed that fault.’  He was as it were beside\r\nhimself with excess of rage, and yet religion had such dominion over him\r\nthat it wrung from him so painful an avowal.”  “From this abyss,” writes\r\nthe Duke of St. Simon, “came forth a prince affable, gentle, humane,\r\nself-restrained, patient, modest, humble, and austere towards himself,\r\nwholly devoted to his obligations and feeling them to be immense; he\r\nthought of nothing but combining the duties of a son and a subject with\r\nthose to which he saw himself destined.”\r\n\r\n“From this abyss “ came forth also a prince singularly well informed,\r\nfond of study, with a refined taste in literature, with a passion for\r\nscience; for his instruction Fenelon made use of the great works composed\r\nfor his father’s education by Bossuet, adding thereto writings more\r\nsuitable for his age; for him he composed the _Fables_ and the _Dialogues\r\ndes Morts,_ and a _Histoire de Charlemagne_ which has perished.  In his\r\nstories, even those that were imaginary, he paid attention before\r\neverything to truth.  “Better leave a history in all its dryness than\r\nenliven it at the expense of truth,” he would say.  The suppleness and\r\nrichness of his mind sufficed to save him from wearisomeness; the\r\nliveliness of his literary impressions communicated itself to his pupil.\r\n“I have seen,” says Fenelon in his letter to the French Academy, “I have\r\nseen a young prince, but eight years old, overcome with grief at sight of\r\nthe peril of little Joash; I have seen him lose patience with the chief\r\npriest for concealing from Joash his name and his birth; I have seen him\r\nweeping bitterly as he listened to these verses:--\r\n\r\n         ‘O! miseram Euridicen anima fugiente vocabat;\r\n          Euridicen toto referebant flumine ripx.’”\r\n\r\nThe soul and mind of Fenelon were sympathetic; Bossuet, in writing for\r\nthe grand-dauphin, was responsive to the requirements of his own mind,\r\nnever to those of the boy’s with whose education he had been intrusted.\r\n\r\nFenelon also wrote _Telemaque_.  “It is a fabulous narrative,” he himself\r\nsays, “in the form of an heroic poem, like Homer’s or Virgil’s, wherein I\r\nhave set forth the principal actions that are meet for a prince whose\r\nbirth points him out as destined to reign.  I did it at a time when I was\r\ncharmed with the marks of confidence and kindness showered upon me by the\r\nking; I must have been not only the most ungrateful but the most\r\ninsensate of men to have intended to put into it satirical and insolent\r\nportraits; I shrink from the bare idea of such a design.  It is true that\r\nI have inserted in these adventures all the verities necessary for\r\ngovernment and all the defects that one can show in the exercise of\r\nsovereign power; but I have not stamped any of them with a peculiarity\r\nwhich would point to any portrait or caricature.  The more the work is\r\nread, the more it will be seen that I wished to express everything\r\nwithout depicting anybody consecutively; it is, in fact, a narrative done\r\nin haste, in detached pieces and at different intervals; all I thought of\r\nwas to amuse the Duke of Burgundy, and, whilst amusing, to instruct him,\r\nwithout ever meaning to give the work to the public.”\r\n\r\n_Telemaque_ was published, without any author’s name and by an\r\nindiscretion of the copyist’s, on the 6th of April, 1699.  Fenelon was in\r\nexile at his diocese; public rumor before long attributed the work to\r\nhim; the _Maximes des Saints_ had just been condemned, _Telemaque_ was\r\nseized, the printers were punished; some copies had escaped the police;\r\nthe book was reprinted in Holland; all Europe read it, finding therein\r\nthe allusions and undermeanings against which Fenelon defended himself.\r\nLouis XIV. was more than ever angry with the archbishop.  “I cannot\r\nforgive M. de Cambrai for having composed the Telemaque,” Madame de\r\nMaintenon would say.  Fenelon’s disgrace, begun by the _Maximes des\r\nSaints_ touching absolute (pure) love, was confirmed by his ideal picture\r\nof kingly power.  Chimerical in his theories of government, high-flown in\r\nhis pious doctrines, Fenelon, in the conduct of his life as well as in\r\nhis practical directions to his friends, showed a wisdom, a prudence, a\r\ntact which singularly belied the free speculations of his mind or his\r\nheart.  He preserved silence amid the commendations and criticisms of the\r\n_Telemaque_.  “I have no need and no desire to change my position,” he\r\nwould say; “I am beginning to be old, and I am infirm; there is no\r\noccasion for my friends to ever commit themselves or to take any doubtful\r\nstep on my account.  I never sought out the court; I was sent for\r\nthither.  I staid there nearly ten years without obtruding myself,\r\nwithout taking a single step on my own behalf, without asking the\r\nsmallest favor, without meddling in any matter, and confining myself to\r\nanswering conscientiously in all matters about which I was spoken to.\r\nI was dismissed; all I have to do is to remain at peace in my own place.\r\nI doubt not that, besides the matter of my condemned work, the policy of\r\n_Telemaque_ was employed against me upon the king’s mind; but I must\r\nsuffer and hold my tongue.”\r\n\r\nEvery tongue was held within range of King Louis XIV.  It was only on the\r\n22d of December, 1701, four years after Fenelon’s departure, that the\r\nDuke of Burgundy thought he might write to him in the greatest secrecy:\r\n“At last, my dear archbishop, I find a favorable opportunity of breaking\r\nthe silence I have kept for four years.  I have suffered many troubles\r\nsince, but one of the greatest has been that of being unable to show you\r\nwhat my feelings towards you were during that time, and that my affection\r\nincreased with your misfortunes, instead of being chilled by them.  I\r\nthink with real pleasure on the time when I shall be able to see you\r\nagain, but I fear that this time is still a long way off.  It must be\r\nleft to the will of God, from whose mercy I am always receiving new\r\ngraces.  I have been many times unfaithful to Him since I saw you, but He\r\nhas always done me the grace of recalling me to Him, and I have not,\r\nthank God, been deaf to His voice.  I continue to study all alone,\r\nalthough I have not been doing so in the regular way for the last two\r\nyears, and I like it more than ever.  But nothing gives me more pleasure\r\nthan metaphysics and ethics, and I am never tired of working at them.  I\r\nhave done some little pieces myself, which I should very much like to be\r\nin a position to send you, that you might correct them as you used to do\r\nmy themes in old times.  I shall not tell you here how my feelings\r\nrevolted against all that has been done in your case, but we must submit\r\nto the will of God and believe that all has happened for our good.\r\nFarewell, my dear archbishop.  I embrace you with all my heart; I ask\r\nyour prayers and your blessing.  --Louis.”\r\n\r\n“I speak to you of God and yourself only,” answered Fenelon in a letter\r\nfull of wise and tender counsels; it is no question of me.  Thank God, I\r\nhave a heart at ease; my heaviest cross is that I do not see you, but I\r\nconstantly present you before God in closer presence than that of the\r\nsenses.  I would give a thousand lives like a drop of water to see you\r\nsuch as God would have you.”\r\n\r\nNext year, in 1702, the king gave the Duke of Burgundy the command of the\r\narmy in Flanders.  He wrote to Fenelon, “I cannot feel myself so near you\r\nwithout testifying my joy thereat, and, at the same time, that which is\r\ncaused by the king’s permission to call upon you on my way; he has,\r\nhowever, imposed the condition that I must not see you in private.  I\r\nshall obey this order, and yet I shall be able to talk to you as much as\r\nI please, for I shall have with me Saumery, who will make the third at\r\nour first interview after five years’ separation.”  The archbishop was\r\npreparing to leave Cambrai so as not to be in the prince’s way; he now\r\nremained, only seeing the Duke of Burgundy, however, in the presence of\r\nseveral witnesses; when he presented him with his table-napkin at supper,\r\nthe prince raised his voice, and, turning to his old master, said, with a\r\ntouching reminiscence of his childhood’s passions, “I know what I owe\r\nyou; you know what I am to you.”\r\n\r\nThe correspondence continued, with confidence and deference on the part\r\nof the prince, with tender, sympathetic, far-sighted, paternal interest\r\non the part of the archbishop, more and more concerned for the perils and\r\ntemptations to which the prince was exposed in proportion as he saw him\r\nnearer to the throne and more exposed to the incense of the world.  “The\r\nright thing is to become the counsel of his Majesty,” he wrote to him on\r\nthe death of the grand dauphin, “the father of the people, the comfort of\r\nthe afflicted, the defender of the church; the right thing is to keep\r\nflatterers aloof and distrust them, to distinguish merit, seek it out and\r\nanticipate it, to listen to everything, believe nothing without proof,\r\nand, being placed above all, to rise superior to every one.  The right\r\nthing is to desire to be father and not master.  The right thing is not\r\nthat all should be for one, but that one should be for all, to secure\r\ntheir happiness.”  A solemn and touching picture of an absolute monarch,\r\nsubmitting to God and seeking His will alone.  Fenelon had early imbued\r\nhis pupil with the spirit of it; and the pupil appeared on the point of\r\nrealizing it; but God at a single blow destroyed all these fair hopes.\r\n“All my ties are broken,” said Fenelon; “I live but on affection, and of\r\naffection I shall die; we shall recover ere long that which we have not\r\nlost; we approach it every day with rapid strides; yet a little while,\r\nand there will be no more cause for tears.”  A week later he was dead,\r\nleaving amongst his friends, so diminished already by death, an\r\nimmeasurable gap, and amongst his adversaries themselves the feeling of a\r\ngreat loss.  “I am sorry for the death of M. de Cambrai,” wrote Madame de\r\nMaintenon on the 10th of January, 1715; “he was a friend I lost through\r\nQuietism, but it is asserted that he might have done good service in the\r\ncouncil, if things should be pushed so far.”  Fenelon had not been\r\nmistaken, when he wrote once upon a time to Madame de Maintenon, who\r\nconsulted him about her defects, “You are good towards those for whom you\r\nhave liking and esteem, but you are cold so soon as the liking leaves\r\nyou; when you are frigid your frigidity is carried rather far, and, when\r\nyou begin to feel mistrust, your heart is withdrawn too brusquely from\r\nthose to whom you had shown confidence.”\r\n\r\nFenelon had never shown any literary prepossessions.  He wrote for his\r\nfriends or for the Duke of Burgundy, lavishing the treasures of his mind\r\nand spirit upon his letters of spiritual guidance, composing, in order to\r\nconvince the Duke of Orleans, his _Traite de l’Existence de Dieu,_\r\nindifferent as to the preservation of the sermons he preached every\r\nSunday, paying more attention to the plans of government he addressed to\r\nthe young dauphin than to the publication of his works.  Several were not\r\ncollected until after his death.  In delivering their eulogy of him at\r\nthe French Academy, neither M. de Boze, who succeeded him, nor M. Dacier,\r\ndirector of the Academy, dared to mention the name of _Telemaque_.\r\nClever (_spirituel_) “to an alarming extent” (_faire peur_) in the\r\nminutest detail of his writings, rich, copious, harmonious, but not\r\nwithout tendencies to lengthiness, the style of Fenelon is the reflex of\r\nhis character; sometimes, a little subtle and covert, like the prelate’s\r\nmind, it hits and penetrates without any flash (_eclat_) and without\r\ndealing heavy blows.  “Graces flowed from his lips,” said Chancellor\r\nd’Aguesseau, “and he seemed to treat the greatest subjects as if, so to\r\nspeak, they were child’s play to him; the smallest grew to nobleness\r\nbeneath his pen, and he would have made flowers grow in the midst of\r\nthorns.  A noble singularity, pervading his whole person, and a something\r\nsublime in his very simplicity, added to his characteristics a certain\r\nprophet-like air.  Always original, always creative, he imitated nobody,\r\nand himself appeared inimitable.”  His last act was to write a letter to\r\nFather Le Tellier to be communicated to the king.  “I have just received\r\nextreme unction; that is, the state, reverend father, when I am preparing\r\nto appear before God, in which I pray you with instance to represent to\r\nthe king my true sentiments.  I have never felt anything but docility\r\ntowards the church and horror at the innovations which have been imputed\r\nto me.  I accepted the condemnation of my book in the most absolute\r\nsimplicity.  I have never been a single moment in my life without feeling\r\ntowards the king personally the most lively gratitude, the most genuine\r\nzeal, the most profound respect, and the most inviolable attachment.  I\r\ntake the liberty of asking of his Majesty two favors, which do not\r\nconcern either my own person or anybody belonging to me.  The first is,\r\nthat he will have the goodness to give me a pious and methodical\r\nsuccessor, sound and firm against Jansenism, which is in prodigious\r\ncredit on this frontier.  The other favor is, that he will have the\r\ngoodness to complete with my successor that which could not be completed\r\nwith me on behalf of the gentlemen of St. Sulpice.  I wish his Majesty a\r\nlong life, of which the church as well as the state has infinite need.\r\nIf peradventure I go into the presence of God, I shall often ask these\r\nfavors of Him.”\r\n\r\nHow dread is the power of sovereign majesty, operative even at the\r\ndeath-bed of the greatest and noblest spirits, causing Fenelon in his\r\ndying hour to be anxious about the good graces of a monarch ere long,\r\nlike him, a-dying !\r\n\r\nOur thoughts may well linger over those three great minds, Pascal,\r\nBossuet, and Fenelon,--one layman and two bishops; all equally absorbed\r\nby the great problems of human life and immortality.  With different\r\ndegrees of greatness and fruitfulness, they all serve the same cause.\r\nWhether as defenders or assailants of Jansenism and Quietism, the\r\nsolitary philosopher or the prelates engaged in the court or in the\r\nguidance of men, all three of them serving God on behalf of the soul’s\r\nhighest interests, remained unique in their generation, and without\r\nsuccessors as they had been without predecessors.\r\n\r\nLeaving the desert and the church, and once more entering the world, we\r\nimmediately encounter, amongst women, one, and one only, in the first\r\nrank--Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marchioness of Sevigne, born at Paris on\r\nthe 5th of February, 1627, five months before Bossuet.  Like a\r\nconsiderable number of women in Italy in the sixteenth century, and in\r\nFrance in the seventeenth, she had received a careful education.  She\r\nknew Italian, Latin, and Spanish; she had for masters Menage and\r\nChapelain; and she early imbibed a real taste for solid reading, which\r\nshe owed to her leaning towards the Jansenists and Port-Royal.  She was\r\nleft a widow at five and twenty by the death of a very indifferent\r\nhusband, and she was not disposed to make a second venture.  Before\r\ngetting killed in a duel, M. de Sevigne had made a considerable gap in\r\nthe property of his wife, who, however, had brought him more than five\r\nhundred thousand livres.  Madame de Sevigne had two children: she made up\r\nher mind to devote herself to their education, to restore their fortune,\r\nand to keep her love for them and for her friends.  Of them she had many,\r\noften very deeply smitten with her; all remained faithful to her, and,\r\nshe deserted none of them, though they might be put on trial and\r\ncondemned like Fouquet, or perfidious and cruel like her cousin M. de\r\nBussy-Rabutin.  The safest and most agreeable of acquaintances, ever\r\nready to take part in the joys as well as the anxieties of those whom she\r\nhonored with her friendship, without permitting this somewhat superficial\r\nsympathy to agitate the depths of her heart, she had during her life but\r\none veritable passion, which she admitted nobody to share with her.  Her\r\ndaughter, Madame de Grignan, the prettiest girl in France, clever,\r\nvirtuous, business-like, appears in her mother’s letters fitful,\r\ncross-grained, and sometimes rather cold.  Madame de Sevigne is a friend\r\nwhom we read over and over again, whose emotions we share, to whom we go\r\nfor an hour’s distraction and delightful chat.  We have no desire to chat\r\nwith Madame de Grignan; we gladly leave her to her mother’s exclusive\r\naffection, feeling infinitely obliged to her, however, for having\r\nexisted, inasmuch as her mother wrote letters to her.  Madame de\r\nSevigne’s letters to her daughter are superior to all her other letters,\r\ncharming as they are.  When she writes to M. de Pomponne, to M. de\r\nCoulanges, to M. de Bussy, the style is less familiar, the heart less\r\nopen, the soul less stirred.  She writes to her daughter as she would\r\nspeak to her; it is not letters, it is an animated and charming\r\nconversation, touching upon everything, embellishing everything with an\r\ninimitable grace.  She gave her daughter in marriage to Count de Grignan\r\nin January, 1669; next year her son-in-law was appointed lieutenant-\r\ngeneral of the king in Provence; he was to fill the place there of the\r\nDuke of Vendome, too young to discharge his functions as governor.  In\r\nthe month of January, 1671, M. de Grignan removed his wife to Aix: he was\r\na Provencal, he was fond of his province, his castle of Grignan, and his\r\nwife.  Madame de Sevigne found herself condemned to separation from the\r\ndaughter whom she loved exclusively.  “In vain I seek my darling\r\ndaughter; I can no longer find her, and every step she takes removes her\r\nfarther from me.  I went to St. Mary’s, still weeping and still dying of\r\ngrief; it seemed as if my heart and my soul were being wrenched from me;\r\nand, in truth, what a cruel separation!  I asked leave to be alone: I was\r\ntaken into Madame du Housset’s room, and they made me up a fire.  Agnes\r\nsat looking at me without speaking: that was our bargain.  I staid there\r\ntill five o’clock, without ceasing to sob: all my thoughts were mortal,\r\nwounds to me.  I wrote to M. de Grignan, you can imagine in what key.\r\nThen I went to Madame de La Fayette’s, who redoubled my griefs by the\r\ninterest she took in them.  She was alone, ill and distressed at the\r\ndeath of one of the nuns; she was just as I could have desired.  I\r\nreturned hither at eight; but when I came in, O! can you conceive what I\r\nfelt as I mounted these stairs?  That room into which I used always to\r\ngo, alas!  I found the doors of it open, but I saw everything\r\ndisfurnished, everything disarranged, and your little daughter, who\r\nreminded me of mine.  The wakenings of the night were dreadful; I think\r\nof you continuously: it is what devotees call an habitual thought, such\r\nas one should have of God, if one did one’s duty.  Nothing gives me any\r\ndistraction.  I see that carriage, which is forever going on and will\r\nnever come near me.  I am forever on the highways; it seems as if I were\r\nafraid sometimes that the carriage will upset with me.  The rains there\r\nhave been for the last three days reduce me to despair; the Rhone causes\r\nme strange alarm.  I have a map before my eyes, I know all the places\r\nwhere you sleep.  This evening you are at Nevers; on Sunday you will be\r\nat Lyons, where you will receive this letter.  I have received only two\r\nof yours; perhaps the third will come; that is the only comfort I desire:\r\nas for others, I seek for none.”  During five and twenty years Madame de\r\nSevign~ could never become accustomed to her daughter’s absence.  She set\r\nout for the Rochers, near Vitry, a family estate of M. de Sevigne’s.  Her\r\nfriend the Duke of Chaulnes was governor of Brittany.  “You shall now\r\nhave news of our states as your penalty for being a Breton.  M. de\r\nChaulnes arrived on Sunday evening, to the sound of everything that can\r\nmake any in Vitry.  On Monday morning he sent me a letter; I wrote back\r\nto say that I would go and dine with him.  There are two dining-tables in\r\nthe same room; fourteen covers at each table.  Monsieur presides at one,\r\nMadame at the other.  The good cheer is prodigious; joints are carried\r\naway quite untouched, and as for the pyramids of fruit, the doors require\r\nto be heightened.  Our fathers did not foresee this sort of machine,\r\nindeed they did not even foresee that a door required to be higher than\r\nthemselves.  Well, a pyramid wants to come in, one of those pyramids\r\nwhich make everybody exclaim from one end of the table to the other; but\r\nso far from that boding damage, people are often, on the contrary, very\r\nglad not to see any more of what they contain.  This pyramid, then, with\r\ntwenty or thirty porcelain dishes, was so completely upset at the door,\r\nthat the noise it made put to silence the violins, hautbois, and\r\ntrumpets.  After dinner, M. de Locmaria and M. de Coetlogon danced with\r\ntwo fair Bretons some marvellous jigs (passe pipds) and some minuets in a\r\nstyle that the court-people cannot approach; wherein they do the Bohemian\r\nand Breton step with a neatness and correctness which are charming.  I\r\nwas thinking all the while of you, and I had such tender recollections of\r\nyour dancing and of what I had seen you dance, that this pleasure became\r\na pain to me.  The States are sure not to be long; there is nothing to do\r\nbut to ask for what the king wants; nobody says a word, and it is all\r\ndone.  As for the governor, he finds, somehow or other, more than forty\r\nthousand crowns coming in to him.  An infinity of presents, pensions,\r\nrepairs of roads and towns, fifteen or twenty grand dinner-parties,\r\nincessant play, eternal balls, comedies three times a week, a great show\r\nof dress, that is the States.  I am forgetting three or four hundred\r\npipes of wine which are drunk; but, if I did not reckon this little item,\r\nthe others do not forget it, and put it first.  This is what is called\r\nthe sort of twaddle to make one go to sleep on one’s feet; but it is what\r\ncomes to the tip of your pen when you are in Brittany and have nothing\r\nelse to say.”\r\n\r\nEven in Brittany and at the Rochers, Madame de Sevigne always has\r\nsomething to say.  The weather is frightful; she is occupied a good deal\r\nin reading the romances of La Calprenede and the _Grand Cyrus,_ as well\r\nas the _Ethics_ of Nicole.  “For four days it has been one continuous\r\ntempest; all our walks are drowned; there is no getting out any more.\r\nOur masons, our carpenters keep their rooms; in short, I hate this\r\ncountry, and I yearn every moment for your sun; perhaps you yearn for my\r\nrain; we do well, both of us.  I am going on with the _Ethics_ of Nicole,\r\nwhich I find delightful; it has not yet given me any lesson against the\r\nrain, but I am expecting it, for I find everything there, and conformity\r\nto the will of God might answer my purpose, if I did not want a specific\r\nremedy.  In fact, I consider this an admirable book; nobody has written\r\nas these gentlemen have, for I put down to Pascal half of all that is\r\nbeautiful.  It is so nice to have one’s self and one’s feelings talked\r\nabout, that, though it be in bad part, one is charmed by it.  What is\r\ncalled searching the depths of the heart with a lantern is exactly what\r\nhe does; he discloses to us that which we feel every day, but have not\r\nthe wit to discern or the sincerity to avow.  I have even forgiven the\r\nswelling in the heart (_l’enflure du coeur_) for the sake of the rest,\r\nand I maintain that there is no other word to express vanity and pride,\r\nwhich are really wind: try and find another word.  I shall complete the\r\nreading of this with pleasure.”\r\n\r\nHere we have the real Madame de Sevigne, whom we love, on whom we rely,\r\nwho is as earnest as she is amiable and gay, who goes to the very core of\r\nthings, and who tells the truth of herself as well as of others.  “You\r\nask me, my dear child, whether I continue to be really fond of life.  I\r\nconfess to you that I find poignant sorrows in it, but I am even more\r\ndisgusted with death; I feel so wretched at having to end all this\r\nthereby, that, if I could turn back again, I would ask for nothing\r\nbetter.  I find myself under an obligation which perplexes me: I embarked\r\nupon life without my consent, and I must go out of it; that overwhelms\r\nme.  And how shall I go?  Which way?  By what door?  When will it be?\r\nIn what condition?  Shall I suffer a thousand, thousand pains, which will\r\nmake me die desperate?  Shall I have brain-fever?  Shall I die of an\r\naccident?  How shall I be with God?  What shall I have to show Him?\r\nShall fear, shall necessity bring me back to Him?  Shall I have no\r\nsentiment but that of dread?  What can I hope?  Am I worthy of heaven?\r\nAm I worthy of hell?  Nothing is such madness as to leave one’s salvation\r\nin uncertainty, but nothing is so natural; and the stupid life I lead is\r\nthe easiest thing in the world to understand.  I bury myself in these\r\nthoughts, and I find death so terrible, that I hate life more because it\r\nleads me thereto than because of the thorns with which it is planted.\r\nYou will say that I want to live forever then: not at all; but, if my\r\nopinion had been asked, I should have preferred to die in my nurse’s\r\narms; that would have removed me from vexations of spirit, and would have\r\ngiven me Heaven full surely and easily.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Sevigne would have very much scandalized those gentlemen of\r\nPort-Royal, if she had let them see into the bottom of her heart as she\r\nshowed it to her daughter.  Pascal used to say, “There are but three\r\nsorts of persons: those who serve God, having found Him; those who employ\r\nthemselves in seeking Him, not having found Him; and those who live\r\nwithout seeking Him or having found Him.  The first are reasonable and\r\nhappy; the last are mad and miserable; the intermediate are miserable and\r\nreasonable.”  Without ever having sought and found God, in the absolute\r\nsense intended by Pascal, Madame de Sevigne kept approaching Him by\r\ngentle degrees.  “We are reading a treatise by M. Namon of Port-Royal on\r\ncontinuous prayer; though he is a hundred feet above my head, he\r\nnevertheless pleases and charms us.  One is very glad to see that there\r\nhave been and still are in the world people to whom God communicates His\r\nHoly Spirit in such abundance; but, O God!  when shall we have some\r\nspark, some degree of it?  How sad to find one’s self so far from it, and\r\nso near to something else!  O, fie!  Let us not speak of such plight as\r\nthat: it calls for sighs, and groans, and humiliations a hundred times a\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nAfter having suffered so much from separation, and so often traversed\r\nFrance to visit her daughter in Provence, Madame de Sevigne had the\r\nhappiness to die in her house at Grignan.  She was sixty-nine, and she\r\nhad been ill for some time; she was subject to rheumatism; her son’s\r\nwildness had for a long while retarded the arrangement of her affairs;\r\nat last he had turned over a new leaf, he was married, he was a devotee.\r\nMadame de Grignan had likewise found a wife for her son, whom the king\r\nhad made a colonel at a very early age; and a husband for her daughter,\r\nlittle Pauline, now Madame de Simiane.  “All this together is extremely\r\nnice, and too nice,” wrote Madame de Sevigne to M. de Bussy, “for I find\r\nthe days going so fast, and the months and the years, that, for my part,\r\nmy dear cousin, I can no longer hold them.  Time flies, and carries me\r\nalong in spite of me; it is all very fine for me to wish to stay it, it\r\nbears me away with it, and the idea of this causes me great fear; you\r\nwill make a pretty shrewd guess why.”  Death came at last, and Madame de\r\nSevigne lost all her terrors.  She was attacked by small-pox whilst her\r\nsick daughter was confined to her bed, and died on the 19th of April,\r\n1696, thanking God that she was the first to go, after having so often\r\ntrembled for her daughter’s health.  “What calls far more for our\r\nadmiration than for our regrets,” writes M. de Grignan to M. de\r\nCoulanges, “is the spectacle of a brave woman facing death, of which she\r\nhad no doubt from the first days of her illness, with astounding firmness\r\nand submission.  This person, so tender and so weak towards all that she\r\nloved, showed nothing but courage and piety when she believed that her\r\nhour was come; and we could not but remark of what utility and of what\r\nimportance it is to have the mind stocked with good matter and holy\r\nreading, for the which Madame de Sevigne had a liking, not to say a\r\nwonderful hungering, from the use she managed to make of that good store\r\nin the last moments of her life.”  She had often taken her daughter to\r\ntask for not being fond of books. “There is a certain person who\r\nundoubtedly has plenty of wits, but of so nice and so fastidious a sort,\r\nthat she cannot read anything but five or six sublime works, which is a\r\nsign of distinguished taste.  She cannot bear historical books; a great\r\ndeprivation this, and of that which is a subsistence to everybody else.\r\nShe has another misfortune, which is, that she cannot read twice over\r\nthose choice books which she esteems exclusively.  This person says that\r\nshe is insulted when she is told that she is not fond of reading: another\r\nbone to pick.”  Madame de Sevigne’s liking for good books accompanied her\r\nto the last, and helped her to make a good end.\r\n\r\nAll the women who had been writers in her time died before Madame de\r\nSevigne.  Madame de Motteville, a judicious and sensible woman, more\r\nindependent at the bottom of her heart than in externals, had died in\r\n1689, exclusively occupied, from the time that she lost Queen Anne of\r\nAustria, in works of piety and in drawing up her _Memoires_.  Mdlle. de\r\nMontpensier, “my great Mademoiselle,” as Madame de Sevigne used to call\r\nher, had died at Paris on the 5th of April, 1693, after a violent\r\nillness, as feverish as her life.  Impassioned and haughty, with her head\r\nso full of her greatness that she did not marry in her youth, thinking\r\nnobody worthy of her except the king and the emperor, who had no fancy\r\nfor her, and ending by a private marriage with the Duke of Lauzun, “a\r\ncadet of Gascony,” whom the king would not permit her to espouse\r\npublicly; clever, courageous, hare-brained, generous, she has herself\r\nsketched her own portrait.  “I am tall, neither fat nor thin, of a very\r\nfine and easy figure.  I have a good mien, arms and hands not beautiful,\r\nbut a beautiful skin and throat too.  I have a straight leg and a\r\nwell-shaped foot; my hair is light, and of a beautiful auburn; my face is\r\nlong, its contour is handsome, nose large and aquiline; mouth neither\r\nlarge nor small, but chiselled, and with a very pleasing expression; lips\r\nvermilion; teeth not fine, but not frightful either.  My eyes are blue,\r\nneither large nor small, but sparkling, soft, and proud, like my mien.  I\r\ntalk a great deal, without saying silly things or using bad words.  I am\r\na very vicious enemy, being very choleric and passionate, and that, added\r\nto my birth, may well make my enemies tremble; but I have also a noble\r\nand a kindly soul.  I am incapable of any base and black deed; and so I\r\nam more disposed to mercy than to justice.  I am melancholic; I like\r\nreading good and solid books; trifles bore me, except verses, and them I\r\nlike, of whatever sort they may be, and undoubtedly I am as good a judge\r\nof such things as if I were a scholar.”\r\n\r\nA few days after Mademoiselle, died, likewise at Paris, Madelaine de la\r\nVergne, Marchioness of La Fayette, the most intimate friend of Madame de\r\nSevigne.  “Never did we have the smallest cloud upon our friendship,” the\r\nlatter would say; “long habit had not made her merit stale to me, the\r\nflavor of it was always fresh and new; I paid her many attentions from\r\nthe mere prompting of my heart, without the propriety to which we are\r\nbound by friendship having anything to do with it.  I was assured, too,\r\nthat I constituted her dearest consolation, and for forty years past it\r\nhad always been the same thing.”  Sensible, clever, a sweet and safe\r\nacquaintance, Madame de La Fayette was as simple and as true in her\r\nrelations with her confidantes as in her writings.  La Princesse de\r\nOlives alone has outlived the times and the friends of Madame de La\r\nFayette.  Following upon the “great sword-thrusts” of La Calprenede or\r\nMdlle. de Scudery, this delicate, elegant, and virtuous tale, with its\r\npure and refined style, enchanted the court, which recognized itself at\r\nits best, and painted under its brightest aspect; it was farewell forever\r\nto the “Pays de Tendre.”  Madame de La Fayette had very bad health; she\r\nwrote to Madame de Sevigne on the 14th of July, 1693, “Here is what I\r\nhave done since I wrote to you last.  I have had two attacks of fever;\r\nfor six months I had not been purged; I am purged once, I am purged\r\ntwice; the day after the second time, I sit down to table.  O, dear!\r\nI feel a pain in my heart; I do not want any soup.  Have a little meat\r\nthen.  No, I do not want any.  Well, you will have some fruit.  I think I\r\nwill.  Very well, then, have some.  I don’t know, I think I will have\r\nsomething by and by; let me have some soup and a chicken this evening.\r\nHere is the evening, and there are the soup and the chicken: I don’t want\r\nthem.  I am nauseated; I will go to bed; I prefer sleeping to eating.  I\r\ngo to bed, I turn round, I turn back, I have no pain, but I have no sleep\r\neither.  I call, I take a book, I shut it up.  Day comes, I get up, I go\r\nto the window.  It strikes four, five, six; I go to bed again, I doze\r\ntill seven, I get up at eight, I sit down to table at twelve, to no\r\npurpose, as yesterday.  I lay myself down in my bed again in the evening,\r\nto no purpose, as the night before.  Are you ill?  Nay.  I am in this\r\nstate for three days and three nights.  At present I am getting some\r\nsleep again, but I still eat merely mechanically, horse-wise, rubbing my\r\nmouth with vinegar otherwise I am very well, and I haven’t even so much\r\npain in the head.”  Fault was found with Madame de La Fayette for not\r\ngoing out.  “She had a mortal melancholy.  What absurdity again!  Is she\r\nnot the most fortunate woman in the world?  That is what people said,”\r\n writes Madame de Sevigne; “it needed that she should be dead to prove\r\nthat she had good reason for not going out, and for being melancholy.\r\nHer reins and her heart were all gone was not that enough to cause those\r\nfits of despondency of which she complained?  And so, during her life,\r\nshe showed reason, and after death she showed reason, and never was she\r\nwithout that divine reason which was her principal gift.”\r\n\r\nMadame de La Fayette had in her life one great sorrow, which had\r\ncompleted the ruin of her health.  On the 16th of March, 1680, after the\r\nclosest and longest of intimacies, she had lost her best friend, the Duke\r\nof La Rochefoucauld.  Carried away in his youth by party strife and an\r\nardent passion for Madame de Longueville, he had at a later period sought\r\nrefuge in the friendship of Madame de La Fayette.  “When women have\r\nwell-formed minds,” he would say, “I like their conversation better than\r\nthat of men; you find with them a certain gentleness which is not met\r\nwith amongst us, and it seems to me, besides, that they express\r\nthemselves with greater clearness, and that they give a more pleasant\r\nturn to the things they say.”  A meddler and intriguer during the\r\nFronde, sceptical and bitter in his _Maximes,_ the Duke of La\r\nRochefoucauld was amiable and kindly in his private life.  Factions and\r\nthe court had taught him a great deal about human nature; he had seen it\r\nand judged of it from its bad side.  Witty, shrewd, and often profound,\r\nhe was too severe to be just.  The bitterness of his spirit breathed\r\nitself out completely in his writings; he kept for his friends that\r\nkindliness and that sensitiveness of which he made sport.  “He gave me\r\nwit,” Madame de La Fayette would say, “but I reformed his heart.”  He\r\nhad lost his son at the passage of the Rhine, in 1672.  He was ill,\r\nsuffering cruelly.  “I was yesterday at M. de La Rochefoucauld’s,”\r\n writes Madame de Sevigne, in 1680.  “I found him uttering loud shrieks;\r\nhis pain was such that his endurance was quite overcome without a single\r\nscrap remaining.  The excessive pain upset him to such a degree that he\r\nwas sitting out in the open air with a violent fever upon him.  He\r\nbegged me to send you word, and to assure you that the wheel-broken do\r\nnot suffer during a single moment what he suffers one half of his life,\r\nand so he wishes for death as a happy release.”  He died with Bossuet at\r\nhis pillow.  “Very well prepared as regards his conscience,” says Madame\r\nde Sevigne again; “that is all settled; but, in other respects, it might\r\nbe the illness and death of his neighbor which is in question, he is not\r\nflurried about it, he is not troubled about it. Believe me, my daughter,\r\nit is not to no purpose that he has been making reflections all his\r\nlife; he has approached his last moments in such wise that they have had\r\nnothing that was novel or strange for him.”  M. de La Rochefoucauld\r\nthought worse of men than of life.  “I have scarcely any fear of\r\nthings,” he had said; “I am not at all afraid of death.”  With all his\r\nrare qualities and great opportunities he had done nothing but\r\nfrequently embroil matters in which he had meddled, and had never been\r\nanything but a great lord with a good deal of wit.  Actionless\r\npenetration and sceptical severity may sometimes clear the judgment and\r\nthe thoughts, but they give no force or influence that has power over\r\nmen.  “There was always a something (_je ne sais quoi_) about M. de La\r\nRochefoucauld,” writes Cardinal de Retz, who did not like him; “he was\r\nfor meddling in intrigues from his childhood, and at a time when he had\r\nno notion of petty interests, which were never his foible, and when he\r\ndid not understand great ones, which, on the other hand, were never his\r\nstrength.  He was never capable of doing anything in public affairs, and\r\nI am sure I don’t know why.  His views were not sufficiently broad, and\r\nhe did not even see comprehensively all that was within his range, but\r\nhis good sense,--very good, speculatively,--added to his suavity, his\r\ninsinuating style, and his easy manners, which are admirable, ought to\r\nhave compensated more than it did for his lack of penetration.  He\r\nalways showed habitual irresolution, but I really do not know to what to\r\nattribute this irresolution; it could not, with him, have come from the\r\nfertility of his imagination, which is anything but lively.  He was\r\nnever a warrior, though he was very much the soldier.  He was never a\r\ngood partyman, though he was engaged in it all his life.  That air of\r\nbashfulness and timidity which you see about him in private life was\r\nturned in public life into an air of apology.  He always considered\r\nhimself to need one, which fact, added to his maxims, which do not show\r\nsufficient belief in virtue, and to his practice, which was always to\r\nget out of affairs with as much impatience as he had shown to get into\r\nthem, leads me to conclude that he would have done far better to know\r\nhis own place, and reduce himself to passing, as he might have passed,\r\nfor the most polite of courtiers and the worthiest (_le plus honnete_)\r\nman, as regards ordinary life, that ever appeared in his century.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: La Rochefoucauld and his fair Friends----629]\r\n\r\nCardinal de Retz had more wits, more courage, and more resolution than\r\nthe Duke of La Rochefoucauld; he was more ambitious and more bold; he\r\nwas, like him, meddlesome, powerless, and dangerous to the state.  He\r\nthought himself capable of superseding Cardinal Mazarin, and far more\r\nworthy than he of being premier minister; but every time he found himself\r\nopposed to the able Italian he was beaten.  All that he displayed, during\r\nthe Fronde, of address, combination, intrigue, and resolution, would\r\nbarely have sufficed to preserve his name in history, if he had not\r\ndevoted his leisure in his retirement to writing his _Memoires_.\r\nVigorous, animated, always striking, often amusing, sometimes showing\r\nrare nobleness and high-mindedness, his stories and his portraits\r\ntransport us to the very midst of the scenes he desires to describe and\r\nthe personages he makes the actors in them.  His rapid, nervous,\r\npicturesque style is the very image of that little dark, quick, agile\r\nman, more soldier than bishop, and more intriguer than soldier,\r\nfaithfully and affectionately beloved by his friends, detested by his\r\nvery numerous enemies, and dreaded by many people, for the causticity of\r\nhis tongue, long after the troubles of the Fronde had ceased, and he was\r\nreduced to be a wanderer in foreign lands, still Archbishop of Paris\r\nwithout being able to set foot in it.  Having retired to Commercy, he\r\nfell under Louis XIV.’s suspicion.  Madame de Sevigne, who was one of his\r\nbest friends, was anxious about him.  “As to our cardinal, I have often\r\nthought as you,” she wrote to her daughter; “but, whether it be that the\r\nenemies are not in a condition to cause fear, or that the friends are not\r\nsubject to take alarm, it is certain that there is no commotion.  You\r\nshow a very proper spirit in being anxious about the welfare of a person\r\nwho is so distinguished, and to whom you owe so much affection.”  “Can I\r\nforget him whom I see everywhere in the story of our misfortunes,”\r\n exclaimed Bossuet, in his funeral oration over Michael Le Tellier,\r\n“that man so faithful to individuals, so formidable to the state, of a\r\ncharacter so high that he could not be esteemed, or feared, or hated by\r\nhalves, that steady genius whom, the while he shook the universe, we saw\r\nattracting to himself a dignity which in the end he determined to\r\nrelinquish as having been too dearly bought, as he had the courage to\r\nrecognize in the place that is the most eminent in Christendom, and as\r\nbeing, after all, quite incapable of satisfying his desires, so conscious\r\nwas he of his mistake and of the emptiness of human greatness?  But, so\r\nlong as he was bent upon obtaining what he was one day to despise, he\r\nkept everything moving by means of powerful and secret springs, and,\r\nafter that all parties were overthrown, he seemed still to uphold himself\r\nalone, and alone to still threaten the victorious favorite with his sad\r\nbut fearless gaze.”  When Bossuet sketched this magnificent portrait of\r\nMazarin’s rival, Cardinal de Retz had been six years dead, in 1679.\r\n\r\nMesdames de Sevigne and de La Fayette were of the court, as were the Duke\r\nof La Rochefoucauld and Cardinal de Retz.  La Bruyere lived all his life\r\nrubbing shoulders with the court; he knew it, he described it, but he was\r\nnot of it, and could not be of it.  Nothing is known of his family.  He\r\nwas born at Dourdan in 1639, and had just bought a post in the Treasury\r\n(_tresorier de France_) at Caen, when Bossuet, who knew him, induced him\r\nto remove to Paris as teacher of history to the duke, grandson of the\r\ngreat Conde.  He remained forever attached to the person of the prince,\r\nwho gave him a thousand crowns a year, and he lived to the day of his\r\ndeath at Conde’s house.  “He was a philosopher,” says Abbe d’Olivet in\r\nhis _Histoire de l’Academie Francaise;_ “all he dreamt of was a quiet\r\nlife, with his friends and his books, making a good choice of both; not\r\ncourting or avoiding pleasure; ever inclined for moderate fun, and with\r\na talent for setting it going; polished in manners, and discreet in\r\nconversation; dreading every sort of ambition, even that of displaying\r\nwit.”  This was not quite the opinion formed by Boileau of La Bruyere.\r\n“Maximilian came to see me at Auteuil,” writes Boileau to Racine on the\r\n19th of May, 1687, the very year in which the _Caracteres_ was published;\r\n“he read me some of his _Theophrastus_.  He is a very worthy (_honnete_)\r\nman, and one who would lack nothing, if nature had created him as\r\nagreeable as he is anxious to be.  However, he has wit, learning, and\r\nmerit.”  Amidst his many and various portraits, La Bruyere has drawn his\r\nown with an amiable pride.  “I go to your door, Ctesiphon; the need I\r\nhave of you hurries me from my bed and from my room.  Would to Heaven I\r\nwere neither your client nor your bore.  Your slaves tell me that you are\r\nengaged and cannot see me for a full hour yet; I return before the time\r\nthey appointed, and they tell me that you have gone out.  What can you be\r\ndoing, Ctesiphon, in that remotest part of your rooms, of so laborious a\r\nkind as to prevent you from seeing me?  You are filing some bills, you\r\nare comparing a register; you are signing your name, you are putting the\r\nflourish.  I had but one thing to ask you, and you had but one word to\r\nreply: yes or no.  Do you want to be singular?  Render service to those\r\nwho are dependent upon you, you will be more so by that behavior than by\r\nnot letting yourself be seen.  O man of importance and overwhelmed with\r\nbusiness, who in your turn have need of my offices, come into the\r\nsolitude of my closet; the philosopher is accessible; I shall not put you\r\noff to another day.  You will find me over those works of Plato which\r\ntreat of the immortality of the soul and its distinctness from the body;\r\nor with pen in hand, to calculate the distances of Saturn and Jupiter.  I\r\nadmire God in His works, and I seek by knowledge of the truth to regulate\r\nmy mind and become better.  Come in, all doors are open to you; my\r\nantechamber is not made to wear you out with waiting for me; come right\r\nin to me without giving me notice.  You bring me something more precious\r\nthan silver and gold, if it be an opportunity of obliging you.  Tell me,\r\nwhat can I do for you?  Must I leave my books, my study, my work, this\r\nline I have just begun?  What a fortunate interruption for me is that\r\nwhich is of service to you!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: La Bruyere----633]\r\n\r\nFrom the solitude of that closet went forth a book unique of its sort,\r\nfull of sagacity, penetration, and severity, without bitterness; a\r\npicture of the manners of the court and of the world, traced by the hand\r\nof a spectator who had not essayed its temptations, but who guessed them\r\nand passed judgment on them all,--“a book,” as M. de Malezieux said to La\r\nBruyere, “which was sure to bring its author many readers and many\r\nenemies.”  Its success was great from the first, and it excited lively\r\ncuriosity.  The courtiers liked the portraits; attempts were made to name\r\nthem; the good sense, shrewdness, and truth of the observations struck\r\neverybody; people had met a hundred times those whom La Bruyere had\r\ndescribed.  The form appeared of a rarer order than even the matter; it\r\nwas a brilliant, uncommon style, as varied as human nature, always\r\nelegant and pure, original and animated, rising sometimes to the height\r\nof the noblest thoughts, gay and grave, pointed and serious.  Avoiding,\r\nby richness in turns and expression, the uniformity native to the\r\nsubject, La Bruyere riveted attention by a succession of touches making a\r\nmasterly picture, a terrible one sometimes, as in his description of the\r\npeasants’ misery:\r\n\r\nTo be seen are certain ferocious animals, male and female, scattered over\r\nthe country, dark, livid, and all scorched by the sun, affixed to the\r\nsoil which they rummage and throw up with indomitable pertinacity; they\r\nhave a sort of articulate voice, and, when they rise to their feet, they\r\nshow a human face; they are, in fact, men.  At night they withdraw to the\r\ncaves, where they live on black bread, water, and roots.  They spare\r\nother men the trouble of sowing, tilling, and reaping for their\r\nlivelihood, and deserve, therefore, not to go in want of the very bread\r\nthey have sown.”  Few people at the court, and in La Bruyere’s day, would\r\nhave thought about the sufferings of the country folks, and conceived the\r\nidea of contrasting them with the sketch of a court-ninny.  “Gold\r\nglitters,” say you, “upon the clothes of Philemon; it glitters as well as\r\nthe tradesman’s.  He is dressed in the finest stuffs; are they a whit the\r\nless so when displayed in the shops and by the piece?  Nay; but the\r\nembroidery and the ornaments add magnificence thereto; then I give the\r\nworkman credit for his work.  If you ask him the time, he pulls out a\r\nwatch which is a masterpiece; his sword-guard is an onyx; he has on his\r\nfinger a large diamond which he flashes into all eyes, and which is\r\nperfection; he lacks none of those curious trifles which are worn about\r\none as much for show as for use; and he does not stint himself either of\r\nall sorts of adornment befitting a young man who has married an old\r\nmillionnaire.  You really pique my curiosity: I positively must see such\r\nprecious articles as those.  Send me that coat and those jewels of\r\nPhilemon’s; you can keep the person.  Thou’rt wrong, Philemon, if, with\r\nthat splendid carriage, and that large number of rascals behind thee, and\r\nthose six animals to draw thee, thou thiukest thou art thought more of.\r\nWe take off all those appendages which are extraneous to thee to get at\r\nthyself, who art but a ninny.”\r\n\r\nMore earnest and less bitter than La Rochefoucauld, and as brilliant and\r\nas firm as Cardinal de Retz, La Bruyere was a more sincere believer than\r\neither.  “I feel that there is a God, and I do not feel that there is\r\nnone; that is enough for me; the reasoning of the world is useless to me.\r\nI conclude that God exists.  Are men good enough, faithful enough,\r\nequitable enough to deserve all our confidence, and not make us wish\r\nat least for the existence of God, to whom we may appeal from their\r\njudgments and have recourse when we are persecuted or betrayed?”  A very\r\nstrong reason and of potent logic, naturally imprinted upon an upright\r\nspirit and a sensible mind, irresistibly convinced, both of them, that\r\njustice alone can govern the world.\r\n\r\nLa Bruyere had just been admitted into the French Academy, in 1693.  In\r\nhis admission speech he spoke in praise of the living, Bossuet, Fenelon,\r\nRacine, La Fontaine; it was not as yet the practice.  Those who were not\r\npraised felt angry, and the journals of the time bitterly attacked the\r\nnew academician.  He was hurt, and withdrew almost entirely from the\r\nworld.  Four days before his death, however, “he was in company.  All at\r\nonce he perceived that he was becoming deaf, yes, stone deaf.  He\r\nreturned to Versailles, where he had apartments at Conde’s house.\r\nApoplexy carried him off in a quarter of an hour on the 11th of May,\r\n1696,” leaving behind him an incomparable book, wherein, according to his\r\nown maxim, the excellent writer shows himself to be an excellent painter;\r\nand four dialogues against Quietism, still unfinished, full of lively and\r\ngood-humored hostility to the doctrines of Madame Guyon.  They were\r\npublished after his death.\r\n\r\nWe pass from prose to poetry, from La Bruyere to Corneille, who had died\r\nin 1684, too late for his fame, in spite of the vigorous returns of\r\ngenius which still flash forth sometimes in his feeblest works.\r\nThroughout the Regency and the Fronde, Corneille had continued to occupy\r\nalmost alone the great French stage.  Rotrou, his sometime rival with his\r\npiece of Venceslas, and ever tenderly attached to him, had died, in 1650,\r\nat Dreux, of which he was civil magistrate.  An epidemic was ravaging the\r\ntown, and he was urged to go away.  “I am the only one who can maintain\r\ngood order, and I shall remain,” he replied.  “At the moment of my\r\nwriting to you the bells are tolling for the twenty-second person to-day;\r\nperhaps to-morrow it will be for me; but my conscience has marked out my\r\nduty.  God’s will be done!”  Two days later he was dead.\r\n\r\nCorneille had dedicated _Polyeucte_ to the regent Anne of Austria.  He\r\npublished in a single year _Rodogune_ and the _Mort de Pompee,_\r\ndedicating this latter piece to Mazarin, in gratitude, he said, for an\r\nact of generosity with which his Eminence had surprised him.  At the same\r\ntime he borrowed from the Spanish drama the canvas of the _Menteur,_ the\r\nfirst really French comedy which appeared on the boards, and which\r\nMoliere showed that he could appreciate at its proper value.  After this\r\nattempt, due perhaps to the desire felt by Corneille to triumph over his\r\nrivals in the style in which he had walked abreast with them, he let\r\ntragedy resume its legitimate empire over a genius formed by it.  He\r\nwrote _Heraclius_ and _Nicomede,_ which are equal in parts to his finest\r\nmasterpieces.  But by this time the great genius no longer soared with\r\nequal flight. _Theodore_ and _Pertharite_ had been failures.  “I don’t\r\nmention them,” Corneille would say, “in order to avoid the vexation of\r\nremembering them.”  He was still living at Rouen, in a house adjoining\r\nthat occupied by his brother, Thomas Corneille, younger than he, already\r\nknown by some comedies which had met with success.  The two brothers had\r\nmarried two sisters.\r\n\r\n               “Their houses twain were made in one;\r\n               With keys and purse the same was done;\r\n               Their wives can never have been two.\r\n               Their wishes tallied at all times;\r\n               No games distinct their children’ knew;\r\n               The fathers lent each other rhymes;\r\n               Same wine for both the drawers drew.” --[Ducis.]\r\n\r\nIt is said, that when Peter Corneille was puizled to end a verse he would\r\nundo a trap that opened into his brother’s room, shouting, “Sans-souci, a\r\nrhyme!”\r\n\r\nCorneille had announced his renunciation of the stage; he was translating\r\ninto verse the _Imitation of Christ_.  “It were better,” he had written\r\nin his preface to _Pertharite,_ “that I took leave myself instead of\r\nwaiting till it is taken of me altogether; it is quite right that after\r\ntwenty years’ work I should begin to perceive that I am becoming too old\r\nto be still in the fashion.  This resolution is not so strong but that it\r\nmay be broken; there is every, appearance, however, of my abiding by it.”\r\n\r\nFouquet was then in his glory, “no less superintendent of literature than\r\nof finance,” and he undertook to recall to the stage the genius of\r\nCorneille.  At his voice, the poet and the tragedian rose up at a single\r\nbound.\r\n\r\n         “I feel the selfsame fire, the selfsame nerve I feel,\r\n          That roused th’ indignant Cid, drove home Iloratius’ steel;\r\n          As cunning as of yore this hand of mine I find,\r\n          That sketched great Pompey’s soul, depicted Cinna’s mind,”--\r\n\r\nwrote Corneille in his thanks to Fouquet.  He had some months before said\r\nto Mdlle. du Pare, who was an actress in Moliere’s company, which had\r\ncome to Rouen, and who was, from her grand airs, nicknamed by the others\r\nthe Marchioness,\r\n\r\n               “Marchioness,”  if Age hath set\r\n               On my brow his ugly die;\r\n               At my years, pray don’t forget,\r\n               You will be as--old as I.\r\n\r\n               “Yet do I possess of charms\r\n               One or two, so slow to fade,\r\n               That I feel but scant alarms\r\n               At the havoc Time hath made.\r\n\r\n               “You have such as men adore,\r\n               But these that you scorn to-day\r\n               May, perchance, be to the fore\r\n               When your own are worn away.\r\n\r\n               “These can from decay reprieve\r\n               Eyes I take a fancy to;\r\n               Make a thousand, years believe\r\n               Whatsoe’er I please of you.\r\n\r\n               “With that new, that coming race,\r\n               Who will take my word for it,\r\n               All the warrant for your face\r\n               Will be what I may have writ.”\r\n\r\nCorneille reappeared upon the boards with a tragedy called _OEdipe,_ more\r\nadmired by his contemporaries than by posterity.  On the occasion of\r\nLouis XIV.’s marriage he wrote for the king’s comedians the _Toison\r\nd’or,_ and put into the mouth of France those prophetic words:--\r\n\r\n     “My natural force abates, from long success alone;\r\n     Triumphant blooms the state, the wretched people groan\r\n     Their shrunken bodies bend beneath my high emprise;\r\n     Whilst glory gilds the throne, the subject sinks and dies.”\r\n\r\n_Sertorius_ appeared at the commencement of the year 1662.  “Pray where\r\ndid Corneille learn politics and war?” asked Turenne when he saw this\r\npiece played.  “You are the true and faithful interpreter of the mind and\r\ncourage of Rome,” Balzac wrote to him; “I say further, sir, you are often\r\nher teacher, and the reformer of olden times, if they have need of\r\nembellishment and support.  In the spots where Rome is of brick, you\r\nrebuild it of marble; where you find a gap, you fill it with a\r\nmasterpiece, and I take it that what you lend to history is always\r\nbetter than what you borrow from it.  .  .  .”  “They are grander and\r\nmore Roman in his verses than in their history,” said La Bruyere.  “Once\r\nonly, in the Cid, Corneille had abandoned himself unreservedly to the\r\nreality of passion; scared at what he might find in the weaknesses of the\r\nheart, he would no longer see aught but its strength.  He sought in man\r\nthat which resists and not that which yields, thus giving his times the\r\nsublime pleasure of an enjoyment that can belong to nought but the human\r\nsoul, a cherished proof of its noble origin and its glorious destiny, the\r\npleasure of admiration, the appreciation of the beautiful and the great,\r\nthe enthusiasm aroused by virtue.  He moves us at sight of a masterpiece,\r\nthrills us at the sound of a noble deed, enchants us at the bare idea of\r\na virtue which three thousand years have forever separated from us.”\r\n (_Corneille et son temps,_ by M. Guizot.)  Every other thought, every\r\nother prepossession, are strangers to the poet; his personages represent\r\nheroic passions which they follow out without swerving and without\r\nsuffering themselves to be shackled by the notions of a morality which\r\nis still far from fixed and often in conflict with the interests and\r\nobligations of parties, thus remaining perfectly of his own time and his\r\nown country, all the while that he is describing Greeks, or Romans, or\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corneille reading to Louis XIV.----642]\r\n\r\nThere is no pleasure in tracing the decadence of a great genius.\r\nCorneille wrote for a long while without success, attributing his\r\nrepeated rebuffs to his old age, the influence of fashion, the capricious\r\ntaste of the generation for young people; he thought himself neglected,\r\nappealing to the king himself, who had ordered _Cinna_ and _Pompee_ to be\r\nplayed at court:--\r\n\r\n     “Go on; the latest born have naught degenerate,\r\n     Naught have they which would stamp them illegitimate\r\n     They, miserable fate! were smothered at the birth,\r\n     And one kind glance of yours would bring them back to earth;\r\n     The people and the court, I grant you, cry them down;\r\n     I have, or else they think I have, too feeble grown;\r\n     I’ve written far too long to write so well again;\r\n     The wrinkles on the brow reach even to the brain;\r\n     But counter to this vote how many could I raise,\r\n     If to my latest works you should vouchsafe your praise!\r\n     How soon so kind a grace, so potent to constrain,\r\n     Would court and people both win back to me again!\r\n     ‘So Sophocles of yore at Athens was the rage,\r\n     So boiled his ancient blood at five-score years of age,’\r\n     Would they to Envy cry, ‘when OEdipus at bay\r\n     Before his judges stood, and bore the votes away.’”\r\n\r\nPosterity has done for Corneille more than Louis XIV. could have done: it\r\nhas left in oblivion _Agesilas, Attila, Titus,_ and _Pulcherie;_ it\r\npreserved the memory of the triumphs only.  The poet was accustomed to\r\nsay with a smile, when he was reproached with his slowness and emptiness\r\nin conversation, “I am Peter Corneille all the same.”  The world has\r\npassed similar judgment on his works; in spite of the rebuffs of his\r\nlatter years, he has remained “the great Corneille.”\r\n\r\nWhen he died, in 1684, Racine, elected by the Academy in 1673, found\r\nhimself on the point of becoming its director; he claimed the honor of\r\npresiding at the obsequies of Corneille.  The latter had not been\r\nadmitted to the body until 1641, after having undergone two rebuffs.\r\nCorneille had died in the night.  The Academy decided in favor of Abbe de\r\nLavau, the outgoing director.  “Nobody but you could pretend to bury\r\nCorneille,” said Benserade to Racine, “yet you have not been able to\r\nobtain the chance.”  It was only when he received into the Academy Thomas\r\nCorneille, in his brother’s place, that Racine could praise to his\r\nheart’s content the master and rival who, in old age, had done him the\r\nhonor to dread him.  “My father had not been happy in his speech at his\r\nown admission,” says Louis Racine ingenuously; “he was in this, because\r\nhe spoke out of the abundance of his heart, being inwardly convinced that\r\nCorneille was worth much more than he.”  Louis XIV. had come in for as\r\ngreat a share as Corneille in Racine’s praises.  He, informed of the\r\nsuccess of the speech, desired to hear it.  The author had the honor of\r\nreading it to him, after which the king said to him, “I am very pleased;\r\nI would praise you more if you had praised me less.”  It was on this\r\noccasion that the great Arnauld, still in disgrace and carefully\r\nconcealed, wrote to Racine: “I have to thank you, sir, for the speech\r\nwhich was sent me from you.  There certainly was never anything so\r\neloquent, and the hero whom you praise is so much the more worthy of your\r\npraises in that he considered them too great.  I have many things that I\r\nwould say to you about that, if I had the pleasure of seeing you, but it\r\nwould need the dispersal of a cloud which I dare to say is a spot upon\r\nthis sun.  I assure you that the ideas I have thereupon are not\r\ninterested, and that what may concern myself affects me very little.  A\r\nchat with you and your companion would give me much pleasure, but I would\r\nnot purchase that pleasure by the least poltroonery.  You know what I\r\nmean by that; and so I abide in peace and wait patiently for God to make\r\nknown to this perfect prince that he has not in his kingdom a subject\r\nmore loyal, more zealous for his true glory, and, if I dare say so,\r\nloving him with a love more pure and more free from all interest.  That\r\nis why I should not bring myself to take a single step to obtain liberty\r\nto see my friends, unless it were to my prince alone that I could be\r\nindebted for it.”  Fenelon and the great Arnauld held the same language,\r\nindependent and submissive, proud and modest, at the same time.  Only\r\ntheir conscience spoke louder than their respect for the king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Racine----646]\r\n\r\nAt the time when Racine was thus praising at the Academy the king and the\r\ngreat Corneille, his own dramatic career was already ended.  He was born,\r\nin 1639, at La Ferte-Milon; he had made his first appearance on the stage\r\nin 1664 with the _Freres ennemis,_ and had taken leave of it in 1673 with\r\n_Phedre_.  _Esther_ and _Athalie,_ played in 1689 and 1691 by the young\r\nladies of St. Cyr, were not regarded by their author and his austere\r\nfriends as any derogation from the pious engagements he had entered into.\r\nRacine, left an orphan at four years of age, and brought up at Port-Royal\r\nunder the influence and the personal care of M. Le Maitre, who called him\r\nhis son, did not at first answer the expectations of his master.  The\r\nglowing fancy of which he already gave signs caused dismay to Lancelot,\r\nwho threw into the fire one after the other two copies of the Greek tale\r\n_Theayene et Chariclee_ which the young man was reading.  The third time,\r\nthe latter learnt it off by heart, and, taking the book to his severe\r\ncensor, “Here,” said he, “you can burn this volume too, as well as the\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\nRacine’s pious friends had fine work to no purpose; nature carried the\r\nday, and he wrote verses.  “Being unable to consult you, I was prepared,\r\nlike Malherbe, to consult an old servant at our place,” he wrote to one\r\nof his friends, “if I had not discovered that she was a Jansenist like\r\nher master, and that she might betray me, which would be my utter ruin,\r\nconsidering that I receive every day letter upon letter, or rather\r\nexcommunication upon excommunication, all because of a poor sonnet.”  To\r\ndeter the young man from poetry, he was led to expect a benefice, and was\r\nsent away to Uzes to his uncle’s, Father Sconin, who set him to study\r\ntheology.  “I pass my time with my uncle, St. Thomas, and Virgil,” he\r\nwrote on the 17th of January, 1662, to M. Vitard, steward to the Duke of\r\nLuynes; “I make lots of extracts from theology and some from poetry.  My\r\nuncle has kind intentions towards me, he hopes to get me something; then\r\nI shall try to pay my debts.  I do not forget the obligations I am under\r\nto you.  I blush as I write; _Erubuit puer, salva res est_ (the lad has\r\nblushed; it is all right).  But that conclusion is all wrong; my affairs\r\ndo not mend.”\r\n\r\nRacine had composed at Uzes the _Freres ennemis,_ which was played on his\r\nreturn to Paris in 1664, not without a certain success; _Alexandre_ met\r\nwith a great deal in 1665; the author had at first intrusted it to\r\nMoliere’s company, but he was not satisfied and gave his piece to the\r\ncomedians of the Hotel de Dourgogne.  Moliere was displeased, and\r\nquarrelled with Racine, towards whom he had up to that time testified\r\nmuch good will.  The disagreement was not destined to disturb the equity\r\nof their judgments upon one another.  When Racine brought out _Les\r\nPlaideurs,_ which was not successful at first, Moliere, as he left, said\r\nout loud, “The comedy is excellent, and they who deride it deserve to be\r\nderided.”  One of Racine’s friends, thinking to do him a pleasure, went\r\nto him in all haste to tell him of the failure of the _Misanthrope_ at\r\nits first representation.  “The piece has fallen flat,” said he; “never\r\nwas there anything so dull; you can believe what I say, for I was there.”\r\n “You were there, and I was not,” replied Racine, “and yet I don’t believe\r\nit, because it is impossible that Moliere should have written a bad\r\npiece.  Go again, and pay more attention to it.”\r\n\r\nRacine had just brought out _Alexandre_ when he became connected with\r\nBoileau, who was three years his senior, and who had already published\r\nseveral of his satires.  “I have a surprising facility in writing my\r\nverses,” said the young tragic author ingenuously.  “I want to teach you\r\nto write them with difficulty,” answered Boileau, “and you have talent\r\nenough to learn before long.”  _Andromaque_ was the result of this novel\r\neffort, and was Racine’s real commencement.\r\n\r\nHe was henceforth irrevocably committed to the theatrical cause.  Nicole\r\nattacking Desmarets, who had turned prophet after the failure of his\r\n_Clovis,_ alluded to the author’s comedies, and exclaimed with all the\r\nseverity of Port-Royal, “A romance-writer and a scenic poet is a public\r\npoisoner not of bodies but of souls.”  Racine took these words to\r\nhimself, and he wrote in defence of the dramatic art two letters so\r\nbitter, biting, and insulting towards Port-Royal and the protectors of\r\nhis youth, that Boileau dissuaded him from publishing the second, and\r\nthat remorse before long took possession of his soul, never to be\r\nentirely appeased.  He had just brought out _Les Plaideurs,_ which had\r\nbeen requested of him by his friends and partly composed during the\r\ndinners they frequently had together.  “I put into it only a few\r\nbarbarous law-terms which I might have picked up during a lawsuit and\r\nwhich neither I nor my judges ever really heard or understood.”  After\r\nthe first failure of the piece, the king’s comedians one day risked\r\nplaying it before him.  “Louis XIV. was struck by it, and did not think\r\nit a breach of his dignity or taste to utter shouts of laughter so loud\r\nthat the courtiers were astounded.”  The delighted comedians, on leaving\r\nVersailles, returned straight to Paris, and went to awaken Racine.\r\n“Three carriages during the night, in a street where it was unusual to\r\nsee a single one during the day, woke up the neighborhood.  There was a\r\nrush to the windows, and, as it was known that a councillor of requests\r\n(law-officer) had made a great uproar against the comedy of the\r\n_Plaideurs,_ nobody had a doubt of punishment befalling the poet who had\r\ndared to take off the judges in the open theatre.  Next day all Paris\r\nbelieved that he was in prison.”  He had a triumph, on the contrary, with\r\n_Britannicus,_ after which the, king gave up dancing in the court\r\nballets, for fear of resembling Nero. _Berenice_ was a duel between\r\nCorneille and Racine for the amusement of Madame Henriette.  Racine bore\r\naway the bell from his illustrious rival, without much glory. _Bajazet_\r\nsoon followed.  “Here is Racine’s piece,” wrote Madame de Sevigne to her\r\ndaughter in January, 1672; if I could send you La Champmesle, you would\r\nthink it good, but without her, it loses half its worth.  The character\r\nof Bajazet is cold as ice, the manners of the Turks are ill observed in\r\nit, they do not make so much fuss about getting married; the catastrophe\r\nis not well led up to, there are no reasons given for that great\r\nbutchery.  There are some pretty things, however, but nothing perfectly\r\nbeautiful, nothing which carries by storm, none of those bursts of\r\nCorneille’s which make one creep.  My dear, let us be careful never to\r\ncompare Racine with him, let us always feel the difference; never will\r\nthe former rise any higher than _Andromaque_.  Long live our old friend\r\nCorneille!  Let us forgive his bad verses for the sake of those divine\r\nand sublime beauties which transport us.  They are master-strokes which\r\nare inimitable.”  Corneille had seen _Bajazet_.  “I would take great care\r\nnot to say so to anybody else,” he whispered in the ear of Segrais, who\r\nwas sitting beside him, “because they would say that I said so from\r\njealousy; but, mind you, there is not in _Bajazet_ a single character\r\nwith the sentiments which should and do prevail at Constantinople; they\r\nhave all, beneath a Turkish dress, the sentiments that prevail in the\r\nmidst of France.”  The impassioned loyalty of Madame de Sevigne, and the\r\nclear-sighted jealousy of Corneille, were not mistaken; Bajazet is no\r\nTurk, but he is none the less very human.  “There are points by which men\r\nrecognize themselves, though there is no resemblance; there are others in\r\nwhich there is resemblance without any recognition.  Certain sentiments\r\nbelong to nature in all countries; they are characteristic of man only,\r\nand everywhere man will see his own image in them.”  [_Corneille et son\r\ntemps,_ by M. Guizot.]  Racine’s reputation went on continually\r\nincreasing; he had brought out _Mithridate_ and _Iphigenie; Phedre_\r\nappeared in 1677.  A cabal of great lords caused its failure at first.\r\nWhen the public, for a moment led astray after the _Phedre_ of Pradon,\r\nreturned to the master-work of Racine, vexation and wounded pride had\r\ndone their office in the poet’s soul.  Pious sentiments ever smouldering\r\nin his heart, the horror felt for the theatre by Port-Royal, and\r\npenitence for the sins he had been guilty of against his friends there,\r\nrevived within him; and Racine gave up profane poetry forever.  “The\r\napplause I have met with has often flattered me a great deal,” said he at\r\na later period to his son, “but the smallest critical censure, bad as it\r\nmay have been, always caused me more of vexation than all the praises had\r\ngiven me of pleasure.”  Racine wanted to turn Carthusian; his confessor\r\ndissuaded him, and his friends induced him to marry.  Madame Racine was\r\nan excellent person, modest and devout, who never went to the theatre,\r\nand scarcely knew her husband’s plays by name; she brought him some\r\nfortune.  The king had given the great poet a pension, and Colbert had\r\nappointed him to the treasury (_tresorier_) at Moulins.  Louis XIV.,\r\nmoreover, granted frequent donations to men of letters.  Racine received\r\nfrom him nearly fifty thousand livres; he was appointed historiographer\r\nto the king.  Boileau received the same title; the latter was not\r\nmarried, but Racine before long had seven children.  “Why did not I turn\r\nCarthusian!” he would sometimes exclaim in the disquietude of his\r\npaternal affection when his children were ill.  He devoted his life to\r\nthem with pious solicitude, constantly occupied with their welfare, their\r\ngood education, and the salvation of their souls.  Several of his\r\ndaughters became nuns.  He feared above everything to see his eldest son\r\ndevote himself to poetry, dreading for him the dangers he considered he\r\nhimself had run.  “As for your epigram, I wish you had not written it,”\r\n he wrote to him; “independently of its being commonplace, I cannot too\r\nearnestly recommend you not to let yourself give way to the temptation of\r\nwriting French verses which would serve no purpose but to distract your\r\nmind; above all, you should not write against anybody.”  This son, the\r\nobject of so much care, to whom his father wrote such modest, grave,\r\npaternal, and sagacious letters, never wrote verses, lived in retirement,\r\nand died young without ever having married.  Little Louis, or Lionval,\r\nRacine’s last child, was the only one who ever dreamt of being a writer.\r\n“You must be very bold,” said Boileau to him, “to dare write verses with\r\nthe name you bear!  It is not that I consider it impossible for you to\r\nbecome capable some day of writing good ones, but I mistrust what is\r\nwithout precedent, and never, since the world was world, has there been\r\nseen a great poet son of a great poet.”  Louis Racine never was a great\r\npoet, in spite of the fine verses which are to be met with in his poems\r\n_la Religion_ and _la Grace_.  His _Memoires_ of his father, written for\r\nhis son, describe Racine in all the simple charm of his domestic life.\r\n“He would leave all to come and see us,” writes Louis Racine; “an equerry\r\nof the duke’s came one day to say that he was expected to dinner at\r\nConde’s house.  ‘I shall not have the honor of going,’ said he; ‘it is\r\nmore than a week since I have seen my wife and children who are making\r\nholiday to-day to feast with me on a very fine carp; I cannot give up\r\ndining with them.’  And, when the equerry persisted, he sent for the\r\ncarp, which was worth about a crown.  ‘Judge for yourself,’ said he,\r\n‘whether I can disappoint these poor children who have made up their\r\nminds to regale me, and would not enjoy it if they were to eat this dish\r\nwithout me.’  He was loving by nature,” adds Louis Racine; “he was loving\r\ntowards God when he returned to Him; and, from the day of his return to\r\nthose who, from his infancy, had taught him to know Him, he was so\r\ntowards them without any reserve; he was so all his life towards his\r\nfriends, towards his wife, and towards his children.”\r\n\r\nBoileau had undertaken the task of reconciling his friend with\r\nPort-Royal.  Nicole had made no opposition, “not knowing what war was.”\r\n M. Arnauld was intractable.  Boileau one day made up his mind to take him\r\na copy of _Phedre,_ pondering on the way as to what he should say to him.\r\n“Shall this man,” said he, “be always right, and shall I never be able to\r\nprove him wrong?  I am quite sure that I shall be right to-day; if he is\r\nnot of my opinion,--he will be wrong.”  And, going to M. Arnauld’s, where\r\nhe found a large company, be set about developing his thesis, pulling out\r\n_Phedre,_ and maintaining that if tragedy were dangerous, it was the\r\nfault of the poets.  The younger theologians listened to him\r\ndisdainfully, but at last M. Arnauld said out loud, “If things are as he\r\nsays, he is right, and such tragedy is harmless.”  Boileau declared that\r\nhe had never felt so pleased in his life.  M. Arnauld being reconciled to\r\n_Phedre,_ the principal step was made next day the author of the tragedy\r\npresented himself.  The culprit entered, humility and confusion depicted\r\non his face; he threw himself at the feet of M. Arnauld, who took him in\r\nhis arms; Racine was thenceforth received into favor by Port-Royal.  The\r\ntwo friends were preparing to set out with the king for the campaign of\r\n1677.  The besieged towns opened their gates before the poets had left\r\nParis.  “How is it that you had not the curiosity to see a siege?” the\r\nking asked them on his return: “it was not a long trip.”  “True, sir,”\r\n answered Racine, always the greater courtier of the two, “but our tailors\r\nwere too slow.  We had ordered travelling suits; and when they were\r\nbrought home, the places which your Majesty was besieging were taken.”\r\n Louis XIV. was not displeased.  Racine thenceforth accompanied him in all\r\nhis campaigns; Boileau, who ailed a great deal, and was of shy\r\ndisposition, remained at Paris.  His friend wrote to, him constantly, at\r\none time from the camp and at another from Versailles, whither he\r\nreturned with the king.  “Madame de Maintenon told me, this, morning,”\r\n writes Racine, “that the king had fixed our pensions at four thousand\r\nfrancs for me and two thousand for you: that is, not including our\r\nliterary pensions.  I have just come from thanking the king.  I laid more\r\nstress upon your case than even my own.  I said, in as many words, ‘Sir,\r\nhe has more wit than ever, more zeal for your Majesty, and more desire to\r\nwork for your glory than ever he had.’  I am, nevertheless, really pained\r\nat the idea of my getting more than you.  But, independently of the\r\nexpenses and fatigue of the journeys, from which I am glad that you are\r\ndelivered, I know that you are so noble-minded and so friendly, that I am\r\nsure you would be heartily glad that I were even better treated.  I shall\r\nbe very pleased if you are.”  Boileau answered at once: “Are you mad with\r\nyour compliments?  Do not you know perfectly well that it was I who\r\nsuggested the way in which things have been done?  And can you doubt of\r\nmy being perfectly well pleased with a matter in which I am accorded all\r\nI ask?  Nothing in the world could be better, and I am even more rejoiced\r\non your account than on my own.”  The two friends consulted one another\r\nmutually about their verses; Racine sent Boileau his spiritual songs.\r\nThe king heard the _Combat du Chretien_ sung, set to music by Moreau\r\n\r\n               “O God, my God, what deadly strife!\r\n               Two men within myself I see\r\n               One would that, full of love to Thee,\r\n               My heart were leal, in death and life;\r\n               The other, with rebellion rife,\r\n               Against Thy laws inciteth me.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to Madame de Maintenon, and, “Madame,” said he, “I know those\r\ntwo men well.”  Boileau sends Racine his ode on the capture of Namur.\r\n“I have risked some very new things,” he says, “even to speaking of the\r\nwhite plume which the king has in his hat; but, in my opinion, if you are\r\nto have novel expressions in verse, you must speak of things which have\r\nnot been said in verse.  You shall be judge, with permission to alter the\r\nwhole, if you do not like it.”  Boileau’s generous confidence was the\r\nmore touching, in that Racine was sarcastic and bitter in discussion.\r\n“Did you mean to hurt me?” Boileau said to him one day.  “God forbid!”\r\n was the answer.  “Well, then, you made a mistake, for you did hurt me.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boileau-Despreaux----650]\r\n\r\nRacine had just brought out _Esther_ at the theatre of St. Cyr.  Madame\r\nde Brinon, lady-superior of the establishment which was founded by Madame\r\nde Maintenon for the daughters of poor noblemen, had given her pupils a\r\ntaste for theatricals.  “Our little girls have just been playing your\r\n_Andromaque,_ wrote Madame de Maintenon to Racine, “and they played it so\r\nwell that they never shall play it again in their lives, or any other of\r\nyour pieces.”  She at the same time asked him to write, in his leisure\r\nhours, some sort of moral and historical poem from which love should be\r\naltogether banished.  This letter threw Racine into a great state of\r\ncommotion.  He was anxious to please Madame de Maintenon, and yet it was\r\na delicate commission for a man who had a great reputation to sustain.\r\nBoileau was for refusing.  “That was not in the calculations of Racine,”\r\n says Madame de Caylus in her Souvenirs.  He wrote _Esther_.  “Madame de\r\nMaintenon was charmed with the conception and the execution,” says Madame\r\nde La Fayette; “the play represented in some sort the fall of Madame de\r\nMontespan and her own elevation; all the difference was that Esther was a\r\nlittle younger, and less particular in the matter of piety.  The way in\r\nwhich the characters were applied was the reason why Madame de Maintenon\r\nwas not sorry to make public a piece which had been composed for the\r\ncommunity only and for some of her private friends.  There was exhibited\r\na degree of excitement about it which is incomprehensible; not one of the\r\nsmall or the great but would go to see it, and that which ought to have\r\nbeen looked upon as merely a convent-play became the most serious matter\r\nin the world.  The ministers, to pay their court by going to this play,\r\nleft their most pressing business.  At the first representation at which\r\nthe king was present, he took none but the principal officers of his\r\nhunt.  The second was reserved for pious personages, such as Father\r\nLa Chaise, and a dozen or fifteen Jesuits, with many other devotees of\r\nboth sexes; afterwards it extended to the courtiers.”  “I paid my court\r\nat St. Cyr the other day, more agreeably than I had expected writes\r\nMadame de Sevigne to her daughter: listened, Marshal Bellefonds and I,\r\nwith an attention that was remarked, and with certain discreet\r\ncommendations which were not perhaps to be found beneath the\r\nhead-dresses’ of all the ladies present.  I cannot tell you how\r\nexceedingly delightful this piece is; it is a unison of music, verse,\r\nsongs, persons, so perfect that there is nothing left to desire.  The\r\ngirls who act the kings and other characters were made expressly for it.\r\nEverything is simple, everything innocent, everything sublime and\r\naffecting.  I was charmed, and so was the marshal, who left his place to\r\ngo and tell the king how pleased he was, and that he sat beside a lady\r\nwell worthy of having seen Esther.  The king came over to our seats.\r\n‘Madame,’ he said to me, ‘I am assured that you have been pleased.’\r\nI, without any confusion,’ replied, ‘Sir, I am charmed; what I feel is\r\nbeyond expression.’  The king said to me, ‘Racine is very clever.’\r\nI said to him, ‘Very, Sir; but really these young people are very clever\r\ntoo; they throw themselves into the subject as if they had never done\r\naught else.’  ‘Ah! as to that,’ he replied, ‘it is quite true.’ And then\r\nhis Majesty went away and left me the object of envy.  The prince and\r\nprincess came and gave me a word, Madame de Maintenon a glance; she went\r\naway with the king.  I replied to all, for I was in luck.”\r\n\r\n_Athalie_ had not the same brilliant success as _Esther_.  The devotees\r\nand the envious had affrighted Madame de Maintenon, who had requested\r\nRacine to write it.  The young ladies of St. Cyr, in the uniform of the\r\nhouse, played the piece quite simply at Versailles before Louis XIV. and\r\nMadame de Maintenon, in a room without a stage.  When the players gave a\r\nrepresentation of it at Paris, it was considered heavy; it did not,\r\nsucceed.  Racine imagined that he was doomed to another failure like that\r\nof _Phedre,_ which he preferred before all his other pieces.  “I am a\r\npretty good judge,” Boileau kept repeating to him: “it is about the best\r\nyou have done; the public will come round to it.”  Racine died before\r\nsuccess was achieved by the only perfect piece which the French stage\r\npossesses,--worthy both of the subject and of the sources whence Racine\r\ndrew his inspiration.  He had, with an excess of scrupulousness,\r\nabandoned the display of all the fire that burned within him; but beauty\r\nnever ceased to rouse him to irresistible enthusiasm.  Whilst reading the\r\nPsalms to M. de Seignelay, when lying ill, he could not refrain from\r\nparaphrasing them aloud.  He admired Sophocles so much that he never\r\ndared touch the subjects of his tragedies.  “One day,” says M. de\r\nValicour, “when he was at Auteuil, at Boileau’s, with M. Nicole and some\r\ndistinguished friends, he took up a Sophocles in Greek, and read the\r\ntragedy of _OEdipus,_ translating it as he went.  He read so feelingly\r\nthat all his auditors experienced the sensations of terror and pity with\r\nwhich this piece abounds.  I have seen our best pieces played by our best\r\nactors, but nothing ever came near the commotion into which I was thrown\r\nby this reading, and, at this moment of writing, I fancy I still see\r\nRacine, book in hand, and all of us awe-stricken around him.”  Thus it\r\nwas that, whilst repeating, but a short time before, the verses of\r\n_Mithridate,_ as he was walking in the Tuileries, he had seen the workmen\r\nleaving their work and coming up to him, convinced as they were that he\r\nwas mad, and was going to throw himself into the basin.\r\n\r\nRacine for a long while enjoyed the favors of the king, who went so far\r\nas to tolerate the attachment the poet had always testified towards\r\nPort-Royal.  Racine, moreover, showed tact in humoring the\r\nsusceptibilities of Louis XIV. and his counsellors.  “Father Bonhours and\r\nFather Rapin (Jesuits) were in my study when I received your letter,” he\r\nwrites to Boileau.  “I read it to them, on breaking the seal, and I gave\r\nthem very great pleasure.  I kept looking ahead, however, as I was\r\nreading, in case there was anything too Jansenistical in it.  I saw,\r\ntowards the end, the name of M. Nicole, and I skipped boldly, or, rather,\r\nmean-spiritedly, over it.  I dared not expose myself to the chance of\r\ninterfering with the great delight, and even shouts of laughter, caused\r\nthem by many very amusing things you sent me.  They are both of them, I\r\nassure you, very friendly towards you, and indeed very good fellows.”\r\n\r\nAll this caution did not prevent Racine, however, from dis pleasing the\r\nking.  After a conversation he had held with Madame de Maintenon about\r\nthe miseries of the people, she asked him for a memorandum on the\r\nsubject.  The king demanded the name of the author, and flew out at him.\r\n“Because he is a perfect master of verse,” said he, “does he think he\r\nknows everything?  And because he is a great poet, does he want to be\r\nminister?”---Madame de Maintenon was more discreet in her relations with\r\nthe king than bold in the defence of her friends; she sent Racine word\r\nnot to come and see her ‘until further orders.’  “Let this cloud pass,”\r\n she said; “I will bring the fine weather back.”  Racine was ill; his\r\nnaturally melancholly disposition had become sombre.  “I know, Madame,”\r\n he wrote to Madame de Maintenon, “what influence you have; but in the\r\nhouse of Port-Royal I have an aunt who shows her affection for me in\r\nquite a different way.  This holy woman is always praying God to send me\r\ndisgraces, humiliations, and subjects for penitence; she will have more\r\nsuccess than you.”  At bottom his soul was not sturdy enough to endure\r\nthe rough doctrines of Port-Royal; his health got worse and worse; he\r\nreturned to court; he was re-admitted by the king, who received him\r\ngraciously.  Racine continued uneasy; he had an abscess of the liver, and\r\nwas a long while ill.  “When he was convinced that he was going to die,\r\nhe ordered a letter to be written to the superintendent of finances,\r\nasking for payment, which was due, of his pension.  His son brought him\r\nthe letter.  ‘Why,’ said he, ‘did not you ask for payment of Boileau’s\r\npension too?  We must not be made distinct.  Write the letter over again,\r\nand let Boileau know that I was his friend even to death.’  When the\r\nlatter came to wish him farewell, he raised himself up in bed with an\r\neffort.  ‘I regard it as a happiness for me to die before you,’ he said\r\nto his friend.  An operation appeared necessary.  His son would have\r\ngiven him hopes.  ‘And you, too,’ said Racine, ‘you would do as the\r\ndoctors, and mock me?  God is the Master, and can restore me to life, but\r\nDeath has sent in his bill.’”\r\n\r\nHe was not mistaken: on the 21st of April, 1699, the great poet, the\r\nscrupulous Christian, the noble and delicate painter of the purest\r\npassions of the soul, expired at Paris, at fifty-nine years of age;\r\nleaving life without regret, spite of all the successes with which he had\r\nbeen crowned.  Unlike Corneille with the Cid, he did not take tragedy and\r\nglory by assault, he conquered them both by degrees, raising himself at\r\neach new effort, and gaining over, little by little, the most passionate\r\nadmirers of his great rival.  At the pinnacle of this reputation and this\r\nvictory, at thirty-eight years of age, he had voluntarily shut the door\r\nagainst the intoxications and pride of success; he had mutilated his\r\nlife, buried his genius in penitence, obeying simply the calls of his\r\nconscience, and, with singular moderation in the very midst of\r\nexaggeration, becoming a father of a family and remaining a courtier, at\r\nthe same time that he gave up the stage and glory.  Racine was gentle and\r\nsensible even in his repentance and his sacrifices.  Boileau gave\r\nreligion the credit for this very moderation.  “Reason commonly brings\r\nothers to faith; it was faith which brought M. Racine to reason.”\r\n\r\nBoileau had more to do with his friend’s reason than he probably knew.\r\nRacine never acted without consulting him.  With Racine, Boileau lost\r\nhalf his life.  He survived him twelve years without ever setting foot\r\nagain within the court after his first interview with the king.  “I have\r\nbeen at Versailles,” he writes to his publisher, M. Brossette, “where I\r\nsaw Madame de Maintenon, and afterwards the king, who overcame me with\r\nkind words; so, here I am more historiographer than ever.  His Majesty\r\nspoke to me of M. Racine in a manner to make courtiers desire death, if\r\nthey thought he would speak of them in the same way afterwards.\r\nMeanwhile that has been but very small consolation to me for the loss of\r\nthat illustrious friend, who is none the less dead though regretted by\r\nthe greatest king in the universe.”  “Remember,” Louis XIV. had said,\r\n“that I have always an hour a week to give you when you like to come.”\r\n Boileau did not go again.  “What should I go to court for?” he would say;\r\n“I cannot sing praises any more.”\r\n\r\nAt Racine’s death Boileau did not write any longer.  He had entered the\r\narena of letters at three and twenty, after a sickly and melancholy\r\nchildhood.  The _Art Poetique_ and the _Lutrin_ appeared in 1674; the\r\nfirst nine _Satires_ and several of the _Epistles_ had preceded them.\r\nRather a witty, shrewd, and able versifier than a great poet, Boileau\r\ndisplayed in the _Lutrin_ a richness and suppleness of fancy which his\r\nother works had not foreshadowed.  The broad and cynical buffoonery of\r\nScarron’s burlesques had always shocked his severe and pure taste.  “Your\r\nfather was weak enough to read _Virgile travesti,_ and laugh over it,” he\r\nwould, say to Louis Racine, “but he kept it dark from me.”  In the\r\n_Lutrin,_ Boileau sought the gay and the laughable under noble and\r\npolished forms; the gay lost by it, the laughable remained stamped with\r\nan ineffaceable seal.  “M. Despreaux,” wrote Racine to his son, “has not\r\nonly received from heaven a marvellous genius for satire, but he has\r\nalso, together with that, an excellent judgment, which makes him discern\r\nwhat needs praise and what needs blame.”  This marvellous genius for\r\nsatire did not spoil Boileau’s natural good feeling.  “He is cruel in\r\nverse only,” Madame de Sevigne used to say.  Racine was tart, bitter in\r\ndiscussion; Boileau always preserved his coolness: his judgments\r\nfrequently anticipated those of posterity.  The king asked him one day\r\nwho was the greatest poet of his reign.  “Moliere, sir,” answered\r\nBoileau, without hesitation.  “I shouldn’t have thought it, rejoined the\r\nking, somewhat astonished; “but you know more about it than I do.”\r\n Moliere, in his turn, defending La Fontaine against the pleasantries of\r\nhis friends, said to his neighbor at one of those social meals in which\r\nthe illustrious friends delighted, “ Let us not laugh at the good soul\r\n(bonhomme) he will probably live longer than the whole of us.”  In the\r\nnoble and touching brotherhood of these great minds, Boileau continued\r\ninvariably to be the bond between the rivals; intimate friend as he was\r\nof Racine, he never quarrelled with Moliere, and he hurried to the king\r\nto beg that he would pass on the pension with which he honored him to the\r\naged Corneille, groundlessly deprived of the royal favors.  He entered\r\nthe Academy on the 3d of July, 1684, immediately after La Fontaine.  His\r\nsatires had retarded his election.  “He praised without flattery; he\r\nhumbled himself nobly” says Louis Racine; “and when he said that\r\nadmission to the Academy was sure to be closed against him for so many\r\nreasons, he set a-thinking all the Academicians he had spoken ill of in\r\nhis works.”  He was no longer writing verses when Perrault published his\r\n_Parallele des anciens et desmodernes-.  “If Boileau do not reply,” said\r\nthe Prince of Conti, “you may assure him that I will go to the Academy,\r\nand write on his chair, ‘Brutus, thou sleepest.’”  The ode on the capture\r\nof Namur,--intended to crush Perrault whilst celebrating Pindar, not\r\nbeing sufficient, Boileau wrote his _Reflexions sur Longin,_ bitter and\r\noften unjust towards Perrault, who was far more equitably treated and\r\nmore effectually refuted in Fenelon’s letter to the French Academy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: La Fontaine, Boileau, Moliere, and Racine----657]\r\n\r\nBoileau was by this time old; he had sold his house at Auteuil, which was\r\nso dear, but he did not give up literature, continuing to revise his\r\nverses carefully, pre-occupied with new editions, and reproaching himself\r\nfor this pre-occupation.  “It is very shameful,” he would say, “to be\r\nstill busying myself, with rhymes and all those Parnassian trifles, when,\r\nI ought to be thinking of nothing but the account I am prepared to go and\r\nrender to God.”  He died on the 13th of March, 1711, leaving nearly all\r\nhe had to the poor.  He was followed to the tomb by a great throng.  “He\r\nhad many friends,” was the remark amongst the people, “and yet we are\r\nassured that he spoke evil of everybody.”  No writer ever contributed\r\nmore than Boileau to the formation of poetry; no more correct or shrewd\r\njudgment ever assessed the merits of authors; no loftier spirit ever\r\nguided a stronger and a juster mind.  Through all the vicissitudes\r\nundergone by literature, and spite of the sometimes excessive severity of\r\nhis decrees, Boileau has left an ineffaceable impression upon the French\r\nlanguage.  His talent was less effective than his understanding; his\r\njudgment and his character have had more influence fluence than his\r\nverses.\r\n\r\nBoileau had survived all his friends.  La Fontaine, born in 1621 at\r\nChateau-Thierry, had died in 1695.  He had entered in his youth the\r\nbrotherhood of the Oratory, which he had soon quitted, being unable, he\r\nused to say, to accustom himself to theology.  He went and came between\r\ntown and town, amusing himself everywhere, and already writing a little.\r\n\r\n    “For me the whole round world was laden with delights;\r\n     My heart was touched by flower, sweet sound, and sunny day,\r\n     I was the sought of friends and eke of lady gay.”\r\n\r\nFontaine was married, without caring much for his wife, whom he left to\r\nlive alone at Chateau-Thierry.  He was in great favor with Fouquet.  When\r\nhis patron was disgraced, in danger of his life, La Fontaine put into the\r\nmouth of the nymphs of Vaux his touching appeal to the king’s clemency:--\r\n\r\n    “May he, then, o’er the life of high-souled Henry pore,\r\n     Who, with the power to take, for vengeance yearned no more\r\n     O, into Louis’ soul this gentle spirit breathe.”\r\n\r\nLater on, during Fouquet’s imprisonment at Pignerol, La Fontaine wrote\r\nfurther,--\r\n\r\n    “I sigh to think upon the object of my prayers;\r\n     You take my sense, Ariste; your generous nature shares\r\n     The plaints I make for him who so unkindly fares.\r\n     He did displease the king; and lo his friends were gone\r\n     Forthwith a thousand throats roared out at him like one.\r\n     I wept for him, despite the torrent of his foes,\r\n     I taught the world to have some pity for his woes.”\r\n\r\nLa Fontaine has been described as a solitary being, without wit, and\r\nwithout external charm of any kind.  La Bruyere has said, “A certain man\r\nappears loutish, heavy, stupid; he can neither talk nor relate what he\r\nhas just seen; he sets himself to writing, and it is a model of\r\nstory-telling; he makes speakers of animals, trees; stones, everything\r\nthat cannot speak.  There is nothing but lightness and elegance, nothing\r\nbut natural beauty and delicacy in his works.”  “He says nothing or will\r\ntalk of nothing but Plato,” Racine’s daughters used to say.  All his\r\ncontemporaries, however, of fashion and good breeding did not form the\r\nsame opinion of him.  The Dowager-duchess of Orleans, Marguerite of\r\nLorraine, had taken him as one of her gentlemen-in-waiting; the Duchess\r\nof Bouillon had him in her retinue in the country; Madame de Montespan\r\nand her sister, Madame de Thianges, liked to have a visit from him.  He\r\nlived at the house of Madame de La Sabliere, a beauty and a wit, who\r\nreceived a great deal of company.  He said of her,\r\n\r\n         “Warm is her heart, and knit with tenderest ties\r\n          To those she loves, and, elsewise, otherwise;\r\n          For such a sprite, whose birthplace is the skies,\r\n          Of manly beauty blent with woman’s grace,\r\n          No mortal pen, though fain, can fitly trace.”\r\n\r\n“I have only kept by me,” she would say, “my three pets (_animaux_): my\r\ndog, my cat, and La Fontaine.”  When she died, M. and Madame d’Hervart\r\nreceived into their house the now old and somewhat isolated poet.  As\r\nD’Hervart was on his way to go and make the proposal to La Fontaine, he\r\nmet him in the street.  “I was coming to ask you to put up at our house,”\r\n said he.  “I was just going thither,” answered Fontaine with the most\r\ntouching confidence.  There he remained to his death, contenting himself\r\nwith going now and then to Chateau-Thierry, as long as his wife lived, to\r\nsell, with her consent, some strip of ground.  The property was going,\r\nold age was coming:--\r\n\r\n          “John did no better than he had begun,\r\n          Spent property and income both as one:\r\n          Of treasure saw small use in any way;\r\n          Knew very well how to get through his day;\r\n          Split it in two: one part, as he thought best,\r\n          He passed in sleep--did nothing all the rest.”\r\n\r\nHe did not sleep, he dreamed.  One day dinner was kept waiting for him.\r\n“I have just come,” said he, as he entered, “from the funeral of an ant;\r\nI followed the procession to the cemetery, and I escorted the family\r\nhome.”  It has been said that La Fontaine knew nothing of natural\r\nhistory; he knew and loved animals; up to his time, fable-writers had\r\nbeen, merely philosophers or satirists; he was the first who was a poet,\r\nunique not only in France but in Europe, discovering the deep and secret\r\ncharm of nature, animating it, with his inexhaustible and graceful\r\ngenius, giving lessons to men from the example of animals, without making\r\nthe latter speak like man; ever supple and natural, sometimes elegant and\r\nnoble, with penetration beneath the cloak of his simplicity, inimitable\r\nin the line which he had chosen from taste, from instinct, and not from\r\nwant of power to transport his genius elsewhither.  He himself has said,\r\n\r\n         “Yes, call me truly, if it must be said,\r\n          Parnassian butterfly, and like the bees\r\n          Wherein old Plato found our similes.\r\n          Light rover I, forever on the wing,\r\n          Flutter from flower to flower, from thing to thing,\r\n          With much of pleasure mix a little fame.”\r\n\r\nAnd in _Psyche:_--\r\n\r\n         “Music and books, and junketings and love,\r\n          And town and country--all to me is bliss;\r\n          There nothing is that comes amiss;\r\n          In melancholy’s self grim joy I prove.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grace, the naturalness, the original independence of the mind and the\r\nworks of La Fontaine had not the luck to please Louis XIV., who never\r\naccorded him any favor, and La Fontaine did not ask for any:--\r\n\r\n         “All dumb I shrink once more within my shell,\r\n          Where unobtrusive pleasures dwell;\r\n          True, I shall here by Fortune be forgot\r\n          Her favors with my verse agree not well;\r\n          To importune the gods beseems me not.”\r\n\r\nOnce only, from the time of Fouquet’s trial, the poet demanded a favor:\r\nLouis XIV., having misgivings about the propriety of the _Contes of La\r\nFontaine,_ had not yet given the assent required for his election to the\r\nFrench Academy, when he set out for the campaign in Luxemburg.  La\r\nFontaine addressed to him a ballad:--\r\n\r\n         “Just as, in Homer, Jupiter we see\r\n          Alone o’er all the other gods prevail;\r\n          You, one against a hundred though it be,\r\n          Balance all Europe in the other scale.\r\n          Them liken I to those who, in the tale,\r\n          Mountain on mountain piled, presumptuously\r\n          Warring with Heaven and Jove.  The earth clave he,\r\n          And hurled them down beneath huge rocks to wail:\r\n          So take you up your bolt with energy;\r\n          A happy consummation cannot fail.\r\n\r\n         “Sweet thought! that doth this month or two avail\r\n          To somewhat soothe my Muse’s anxious care.\r\n          For certain minds at certain stories rail,\r\n          Certain poor jests, which nought but trifles are.\r\n          If I with deference their lessons hail,\r\n          What would they more?  Be you more prone to spare,\r\n          More kind than they; less sheathed in rigorous mail;\r\n          Prince, in a word, your real self declare\r\n          A happy consummation cannot fail.”\r\n\r\nThe election of Boileau to the Academy appeased the king’s humor, who\r\npreferred the other’s intellect to that of La Fontaine.  “The choice you\r\nhave made of M. Despreaux is very gratifying to me,” he said to the board\r\nof the Academy: “it will be approved of by everybody.  You can admit La\r\nFontaine at once; he has promised to be good.”  It was a rash promise,\r\nwhich the poet did not always keep.\r\n\r\nThe friends, of La Fontaine had but lately wanted to reconcile him to his\r\nwife.  They had with that view sent him to Chateau-Thierry; he returned\r\nwithout having seen her whom he went to visit.  “My wife was not at\r\nhome,” said he; “she had gone to the sacrament (_au salut_).”  He was\r\nbecoming old.  Those same faithful friends--Racine, Boileau, and Maucroix\r\n--were trying to bring him home to God.  Racine took him to church with\r\nhim; a Testament was given him.  “That is a very good book,” said he;\r\n“I assure you it is a very good book.”  Then all at once addressing Abbe\r\nBoileau, “Doctor, do you think that St. Augustin was as clever as\r\nRabelais?”  He was ill, however, and began to turn towards eternity his\r\ndreamy and erratic thoughts.  He had set about composing pious hymns.\r\n“The best of thy friends has not a fortnight to live,” he wrote to\r\nMaucroix; “for two months I have not been out, unless to go to the\r\nAcademy for amusement.  Yesterday, as I was returning, I was seized in\r\nthe middle of Rue du Chantre with a fit of such great weakness that I\r\nreally thought I was dying.  O, my dear friend, to die is nothing; but\r\nthinkest thou that I am about to appear before God?  Thou knowest how I\r\nhave lived.  Before thou hast this letter, the gates of eternity will,\r\nperchance, be opened for me.”  “He is as simple as a child,” said the\r\nwoman who took care of him in his last illness; “if he has done amiss, it\r\nwas from ignorance rather than wickedness.”  A charming and a curious\r\nbeing, serious and simple, profound and childlike, winning by reason of\r\nhis very vagaries, his good-natured originality, his helplessness in\r\ncommon life, La Fontaine knew how to estimate the literary merits as well\r\nas the moral qualities of his illustrious friends.  “When they happened\r\nto be together,” says he, in his tale of _Psyche,_ “and had talked to\r\ntheir heart’s content of their diversions, if they chanced to stumble\r\nupon any point of science or literature, they profited by the occasion,\r\nwithout, however, lingering too long over one and the same subject, but\r\nflitting from one topic to another like bees that meet as they go with\r\ndifferent sorts of flowers.  Envy, malignity, or cabal had no voice\r\namongst them; they adored the works of the ancients, refused not the\r\nmoderns the praises which were their due, spoke of their own with\r\nmodesty, and gave one another honest advice when any one of them fell ill\r\nof the malady of the age and wrote a book, which happened now and then.\r\nIn this case, Acanthus (Racine) did not fail to propose a walk in some\r\nplace outside the town, in order to hear the reading with less noise and\r\nmore pleasure.  He was extremely fond of gardens, flowers, foliage.\r\nPolyphile (La Fontaine) resembled him in this; but then Polyphile might\r\nbe said to love all things.  Both of them were lyrically inclined, with\r\nthis difference, that Acanthus was rather the more pathetic, Polyphile\r\nthe more ornate.”\r\n\r\nWhen La Fontaine died, on the 13th of April, 1695, of the four friends\r\nlately assembled at Versailles to read the tale of _Psyche,_ Moliere\r\nalone had disappeared.  La Fontaine had admired at Vaux the young comic\r\npoet, who had just written the _Facheux_ for the entertainment given by\r\nFouquet to Louis XIV.:--\r\n\r\n              “It is a work by Moliere;\r\n               This writer, of a style so rare,\r\n               Is nowadays the court’s delight\r\n               His fame, so rapid is its flight,\r\n               Beyond the bounds of Rome must be:\r\n               Amen! For he’s the man for me.”\r\n\r\nIn his old age he gave vent to his grief and his regret at Moliere’s\r\ndeath in this touching epitaph:--\r\n\r\n         “Beneath this stone Plautus and Terence lie,\r\n          Though lieth here but Moliere alone\r\n          Their threefold gifts of mind made up but one,\r\n          That witched all France with noble comedy.\r\n          Now are they gone: and little hope have I\r\n          That we again shall look upon the three\r\n          Dead men, methinks, while countless years roll by,\r\n          Terentius, Plautus, Moliere will be.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Moliere----664]\r\n\r\nMoliere and French comedy had no need to take shelter beneath the mantle\r\nof the ancients; they, together, had shed upon the world incomparable\r\nlustre.  Shakespeare might dispute with Corneille and Racine the sceptre\r\nof tragedy; he had succeeded in showing himself as full of power, with\r\nmore truth, as the one, and as full of tenderness, with more profundity,\r\nas the other.  Moliere is superior to him in originality, abundance, and\r\nperfection of characters; he yields to him neither in range, nor\r\npenetration, nor complete knowledge of human nature.  The lives of these\r\ntwo great geniuses, authors and actors both together, present in other\r\nrespects certain features of resemblance.  Both were intended for another\r\ncareer than that of the stage; both, carried away by an irresistible\r\npassion, assembled about them a few actors, leading at first a roving\r\nlife, to end by becoming the delight of the court and of the world.  John\r\nBaptist Poquelin, who before long assumed the name of Moliere, was born\r\nat Paris in 1622; his father, upholstery-groom-of-the-chamber (_valet de\r\nchambre tapissier_) to Louis XIV., had him educated with some care at\r\nClermont (afterwards Louis-le-Grand) College, then in the hands of the\r\nJesuits.  He attended, by favor, the lessons which the philosopher\r\nGassendi, for a longtime, the opponent of Descartes, gave young Chapelle.\r\nHe imbibed at these lessons, together with a more extensive course of\r\ninstruction, a certain freedom of thinking which frequently cropped out\r\nin his plays, and contributed later on to bring upon him an accusation of\r\nirreligion.  In 1645 (?1643), Moliere had formed, with the ambitious\r\ntitle of _illustre theatre,_ a small company of actors, who, being unable\r\nto maintain themselves at Paris, for a long while tramped the provinces\r\nthrough all the troubles of the Fronde.  It was in 1653 that Moliere\r\nbrought out at Lyons his comedy _l’Etourdi,_ the first regular piece he\r\nhad ever composed.  The _Depit amoureux_ was played at Beziers in 1656,\r\nat the opening of the session of the States of Languedoc; the company\r\nreturned to Paris in 1658; in 1659, Moliere, who had obtained a license\r\nfrom the king, gave at his own theatre _les Precieuses ridicules_.  He\r\nbroke with all imitation of the Italians and the Spaniards, and, taking\r\noff to the life the manners of his own times, he boldly attacked the\r\naffected exaggeration and absurd pretensions of the vulgar imitators of\r\nthe Hotel de Rambouillet.  “Bravo! Moliere,” cried an old man from the\r\nmiddle of the pit; “this is real comedy.”  When he published his piece,\r\nMoliere, anxious not to give umbrage to a powerful clique, took care to\r\nsay in his preface that he was not attacking real _precieuses,_ but only\r\nthe bad imitations.\r\n\r\nJust as he had recalled Corneille to the stage, Fouquet was for\r\nprotecting Moliere upon it.  The _Ecole des Mans_ and the _Facheux_ were\r\nplayed at Vaux.  Amongst the ridiculous characters in this latter,\r\nMoliere had not described the huntsman.  Louis XIV. himself indicated to\r\nhim the Marquis of Soyecour.  “There’s one you have forgotten,” he said.\r\nTwenty-four hours later, the bore of a huntsman, with all his jargon of\r\nvenery, had a place forever amongst the _Facheux_ of Moliere.  The _Ecole\r\ndes Femmes,_ the _Impromptu de Versailles,_ the _Critique de l’Ecole des\r\nFemmes,_ began the bellicose period in the great comic poet’s life.\r\nAccused of impiety, attacked in the honor of his private life, Moliere,\r\nreturning insult for insult, delivered over those amongst his enemies who\r\noffered a butt for ridicule to the derision of the court and of\r\nposterity.  The _Festin de Pierre_ and the signal punishment of the\r\nlibertine (free-thinker) were intended to clear the author from the\r\nreproach of impiety; _la Princesse d’Elide_ and _l’Amour medecin_ were\r\nbut charming interludes in the great struggle henceforth instituted\r\nbetween reality and appearance.  In 1666, Moliere produced _le\r\nMisanthrope,_ a frank and noble spirit’s sublime invective against the\r\nfrivolity, perfidious and showy semblances of court.  “This misanthrope’s\r\ndespitefulness against bad verses was copied from me; Moliere himself\r\nconfessed as much to me many a time,” wrote Boileau one day.  The\r\nindignation of Alceste is deeper and more universal than that of Boileau\r\nagainst bad poets; he is disgusted with the court and the world because\r\nhe is honest, virtuous, and sincere, and sees corruption triumphant\r\naround him; he is wroth to feel the effects of it in his life, and almost\r\nin his own soul.  He is a victim to the eternal struggle between good and\r\nevil without the strength and the unquenchable hope of Christianity.  The\r\n_Misanthrope_ is a shriek of despair uttered by virtue, excited and\r\nalmost distraught at the defeat she forebodes.  The _Tartuffe_ was a new\r\neffort in the same direction, and bolder in that it attacked religious\r\nhypocrisy, and seemed to aim its blows even at religion itself.  Moliere\r\nwas a long time working at it; the first acts had been played in 1664, at\r\ncourt, under the title of _l’Hypocrite,_ at the same time as\r\n_la Princesse d’Elide_.  “The king,” says the account of the\r\nentertainment in the _Gazette de Loret,_ “saw so much analogy of form\r\nbetween those whom true devotion sets in the way of heaven and those whom\r\nan empty ostentation of good deeds does not hinder from committing bad,\r\nthat his extreme delicacy in respect of religious matters could with\r\ndifficulty brook this resemblance of vice to virtue; and though there\r\nmight be no doubt of the author’s good intentions, he prohibited the\r\nplaying of this comedy before the public until it should be quite\r\nfinished and examined by persons qualified to judge of it, so as not to\r\nlet advantage be taken of it by others less capable of just discernment\r\nin the matter.”  Though played once publicly, in 1667, under the title of\r\n_l’Imposteur,_ the piece did not appear definitively on the stage until\r\n1669, having undoubtedly excited more scandal by interdiction than it\r\nwould have done by representation.  The king’s good sense and judgment at\r\nlast prevailed over the terrors of the truly devout and the resentment of\r\nhypocrites.  He had just seen an impious piece of buffoonery played.\r\n“I should very much like to know,” said he to the Prince of Conde, who\r\nstood up for Moliere, an old fellow-student of his brother’s, the Prince\r\nof Conti’s, “why people who are so greatly scandalized at Moliere’s\r\ncomedy say nothing about _Scaramouche?_”  “The reason of that,” answered\r\nthe prince, “is, that Scaramouche makes fun of heaven and religion, about\r\nwhich those gentry do not care, and that Moliere makes fun of their own\r\nselves, which they cannot brook.”  The prince might have added that all\r\nthe blows in _Tartuffe,_ a masterpiece of shrewdness, force, and fearless\r\nand deep wrath, struck home at hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nWhilst waiting for permission to have _Tartufe_ played, Moliere had\r\nbrought out _le Medecin malgre lui, Amphitryon, Georges Dandin,_ and\r\n_l’Avare,_ lavishing freely upon them the inexhaustible resources of his\r\ngenius, which was ever ready to supply the wants of kingly and princely\r\nentertainments. _Monsieur de Pourceaugnac_ was played for the first time\r\nat Chambord, on the 6th of October, 1669; a year afterwards, on the same\r\nstage, appeared _Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,_ with the interludes and music\r\nof Lulli.  The piece was a direct attack upon one of the most frequent\r\nabsurdities of his day; many of the courtiers felt in their hearts that\r\nthey were attacked; there was a burst of wrath at the first\r\nrepresentation, by which the king had not appeared to be struck.  Moliere\r\nthought it was all over with him.  Louis XIV. desired to see the piece a\r\nsecond time.  “You have never written anything yet which has amused me so\r\nmuch; your comedy is excellent,” said he to the poet; the court was at\r\nonce seized with a fit of admiration.\r\n\r\nThe king had lavished his benefits upon Moliere, who had an hereditary\r\npost near him as groom-of-the-chamber; he had given him a pension of\r\nseven thousand livres, and the license of the king’s theatre; he had been\r\npleased to stand godfather to one of his children, to whom the Duchess of\r\nOrleans was godmother; he had protected him against the superciliousness\r\nof certain servants of his bedchamber, but all the monarch’s puissance\r\nand constant favors could not obliterate public prejudice, and give the\r\ncomedian whom they saw every day on the boards the position and rank\r\nwhich his genius deserved.  Moliere’s friends urged him to give up the\r\nstage.  “Your health is going,” Boileau would say to him, “because the\r\nduties of a comedian exhaust you.  Why not give it up?”  “Alas!” replied\r\nMoliere, with a sigh, “it is a point of honor that prevents me.”\r\n “A what?” rejoined Boileau; “what! to smear your face with a mustache as\r\nSganarelle, and come on the stage to be thrashed with a stick?  That is a\r\npretty point of honor for a philosopher like you!”\r\n\r\nMoliere might probably have followed the advice of Boileau, he might\r\nprobably have listened to the silent warnings of his failing powers, if\r\nhe had not been unfortunate and sad.  Unhappy in his marriage, justly\r\njealous and yet passionately fond of his wife, without any consolation\r\nwithin him against the bitternesses and vexations of his life, he sought\r\nin work and incessant activity the only distractions which had any charm\r\nfor a high spirit, constantly wounded in its affections and its\r\nlegitimate pride: _Psyche, Les Fourberies de Scapin, La Comtesse\r\nd’Escarbagnas,_ betrayed nothing of their author’s increasing sadness or\r\nsuffering. _Les Femmes Savantes_ had at first but little success; the\r\npiece was considered heavy; the marvellous nicety of the portraits, the\r\ncorrectness of the judgments, the delicacy and elegance of the dialogue,\r\nwere not appreciated until later on.  Moliere had just composed\r\n_Le Malade Imaginaire,_ the last of that succession of blows which he had\r\nso often dealt the doctors; he was more ailing than ever; his friends,\r\neven his actors themselves pressed him not to have any play.  “What would\r\nyou have me do?”  he replied; “there are fifty poor workmen who have but\r\ntheir day’s pay to live upon; what will they do if we have no play?  I\r\nshould reproach myself with having neglected to give them bread for one\r\nsingle day, if I could really help it.”  Moliere had a bad voice, a\r\ndisagreeable hiccough, and harsh inflexions.  “He was, nevertheless,” say\r\nhis contemporaries, “a comedian from head to foot; he seemed to have\r\nseveral voices, everything about him spoke, and, by a caper, by a smile,\r\nby a wink of the eye and a shake of the head, he conveyed more than, the\r\ngreatest speaker could have done by talking in an hour.”  He played as\r\nusual on the 17th of February, 1673; the curtain had risen exactly at\r\nfour o’clock; Moliere could hardly stand, and he had a fit during the\r\nburlesque ceremony (at the end of the play) whilst pronouncing the word\r\nJuro.  He was icy-cold when he went back to Baron’s box, who was waiting\r\nfor him, who saw him home to Rue Richelieu, and who at the same time sent\r\nfor his wife and two sisters of charity.  When he went up again, with\r\nMadame Moliere, into the room, the great comedian was dead.  He was only\r\nfifty-one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Death of Moliere----669]\r\n\r\nIt has been a labor of love to go into some detail over the lives, works,\r\nand characters of the great writers during the age of Louis XIV.  They\r\ndid too much honor to their time and their country, they had too great\r\nand too deep an effect in France and in Europe upon the successive\r\ndevelopments of the human intellect, to refuse them an important place\r\nin the history of that France to whose influence and glory they so\r\npowerfully contributed.\r\n\r\nMoliere did not belong to the French Academy; his profession had shut the\r\ndoors against him.  It was nearly a hundred years after his death, in\r\n1778, that the Academy raised to him a bust, beneath which was engraved,\r\n\r\n          “O His glory lacks naught, ours did lack him.”\r\n\r\nIt was by instinct and of its own free choice that the French Academy had\r\nrefused to elect a comedian: it had grown, and its liberty had increased\r\nunder the sway of, Louis XIV.  In 1672, at the death of Chancellor\r\nSeguier, who became its protector after Richelieu, “it was so honored\r\nthat the king was graciously pleased to take upon himself this office:\r\nthe body had gone to thank him; his Majesty desired that the dauphin\r\nshould be witness of what passed on an occasion so honorable to\r\nliterature; after the speech of M. Harlay, Archbishop of Paris, and the\r\nman in France with most inborn talent for speaking, the king, appearing\r\nsomewhat touched, gave the Academicians very great marks of esteem,\r\ninquired the names, one after another, of those whose faces were not\r\nfamiliar to him, and said aside to M. Colbert, who was there in his\r\ncapacity of simple Academician, ‘You will let me know what I must do for\r\nthese gentlemen.’  Perhaps M. Colbert, that minister who was so zealous\r\nfor the fine arts, never received an order more in conformity with his\r\nown inclinations.”  From that time, the French Academy held its sittings\r\nat the Louvre, and, as regarded complimentary addresses to the king on\r\nstate occasions, it took rank with the sovereign bodies.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-five years the Academy had been working at its Dictionnaire.\r\nFrom the first, the work had appeared interminable:--\r\n\r\n          “These six years past they toil at letter F,\r\n          And I’d be much obliged if Destiny\r\n          would whisper to me, Thou shalt live to G,--\r\n\r\nwrote Bois-Robert to Balzac.  The Academy had intrusted Vaugelas with the\r\npreparatory labor.  “It was,” says Pellisson, “the only way of coming\r\nquickly to an end.”  A pension, which he had, not been paid for a long\r\ntime past was revived in his favor.  Vaugelas took his plan to Cardinal\r\nRichelieu.  “Well, sir,” said the minister, smiling with a somewhat\r\ncontemptuous air of kindness, “you will not forget the word pension in\r\nthis Dictionary.”  “No, Monsignor,” replied M. de Vaugelas, with a\r\nprofound bow, “and still less _reconnaissance_ (gratitude).”  Vaugelas\r\nhad finished the first volume of his _Remarques sur la Langue Francaise,_\r\nwhich has ever since reniained the basis of all works on grammar.  “He\r\nhad imported into the body of the work a something or other so estimable\r\n(_d’honnete homme_), and so much frankness, that one could scarcely help\r\nloving its author.”  He was working at the second volume when he died, in\r\n1649, so poor that his creditors seized his papers, making it very\r\ndifficult for the Academy to recover his _Memoires_.  The Dictionary,\r\nhaving lost its principal author, went on so slowly that Colbert, curious\r\nto know whether the Academicians honestly earned their modest medals for\r\nattendance (_jetons de presence_) which he had assigned to them, came one\r\nday unexpectedly to a sitting: he was present at the whole discussion,\r\n“after which, having seen the attention and care which the Academy was\r\nbestowing upon the composition of its Dictionary, he said, as he rose,\r\nthat he was convinced that it could not get on any faster, and his\r\nevidence ought to be of so much the more weight in that never man in his\r\nposition was more laborious or more diligent.”\r\n\r\nThe Academicians who were men of letters worked at the Dictionary; the\r\nAcademicians who were men of fashion had become pretty numerous; Arnauld\r\nd’Andilly and M. de Lamoignon, whom the body had honored by election,\r\ndeclined to join, and the Academy resolved to never elect anybody without\r\na previously expressed desire and request.  At the time when M. de\r\nLamoignon declined, the kin, fearing that it might bring the Academy into\r\nsome disfavor, procured the appointment, in his stead, of the Coadjutor\r\nof Strasbourg, Armand de Rohan-Soubise.  “Splendid as your triumph may\r\nbe,” wrote Boileau to M. de Lamoignon, “I am persuaded, sir, from what I\r\nknow of your noble and modest character, that you are very sorry to have\r\ncaused this displeasure to a body which is after all very illustrious,\r\nand that you will attempt to make it manifest to all the earth.  I am\r\nquite willing to believe that you had good reasons for acting as you have\r\ndone.”  The Academy from that moment regarded the title it conferred as\r\nirrevocable: it did not fill up the place of the Abbe de St. Pierre when\r\nit found itself obliged to exclude him from its sittings, by order of\r\nLouis XV.; it did not fill up the place of Mgr. Dupanloup, when he\r\nthought proper to send in his resignation.  In spite of court intrigues,\r\nit from that moment maintained its independence and its dignity.\r\n“M. Despreaux,” writes the banker Leverrier to the Duke of Noailles,\r\n“represented to the Academy, with a great deal of heat, that all was rack\r\nand ruin, since it was nothing more but a cabal of women that put\r\nAcademicians in the place of those who died.  Then he read out loud some\r\nverses by M. de St. Aulaire.  .  .  .  Thus M. Despreaux, before the eyes\r\nof everybody, gave M. de St. Aulaire a black ball, and nominated, all by\r\nhimself, M. de Mimeure.  Here, monseigneur, is proof that there are\r\nRomans still in the world, and, for the future, I will trouble you to\r\ncall M. Despreaux no longer your dear poet, but your dear Cato.”\r\n\r\nWith his extreme deafness, Boileau had great difficulty in fulfilling his\r\nAcademic duties.  He was a member of the Academy of medals and\r\ninscriptions, founded by Colbert in 1662, “in order to render the acts of\r\nthe king immortal, by deciding the legends of the medals struck in his\r\nhonor.”  Pontchartrain raised to forty the number of the members of the\r\n_petite acadamie,_ extended its functions, and intrusted it thenceforth\r\nwith the charge of publishing curious documents relating to the history\r\nof France.  “We had read to us to-day a very learned work, but rather\r\ntiresome,” says Boileau to M. Pontchartrain, “and we were bored right\r\neruditely; but afterwards there was an examination of another which was\r\nmuch more agreeable, and the reading of which attracted considerable\r\nattention.  As the reader was put quite close to me, I was in a position\r\nto hear and to speak of it.  All I ask you, to complete the measure of\r\nyour kindnesses, is to be kind enough to let everybody know that, if I am\r\nof so little use at the Academy of Medals, it is equally true that I do\r\nnot and do not wish to obtain any pecuniary advantage from it.”\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Sciences had already for many years had sittings in one of\r\nthe rooms of the king’s library.  Like the French Academy, it had owed\r\nits origin to private meetings at which Descartes, Gassendi, and young\r\nPascal were accustomed to be present.  “There are in the world scholars\r\nof two sorts,” said a note sent to Colbert about the formation of the new\r\nAcademy.  “One give themselves up to science because it is a pleasure to\r\nthem: they are content, as the fruit of their labors, with the knowledge\r\nthey acquire, and, if they are known, it is only amongst those with whom\r\nthey converse unambitiously and for mutual instruction; these are _bona\r\nfide_ scholars, whom it is impossible to do without in a design so great\r\nas that of the _Academie royale_.  There are others who cultivate science\r\nonly as a field which is to give them sustenance, and, as they see by\r\nexperience that great rewards fall only to those who make the most noise\r\nin the world, they apply themselves especially, not to making new\r\ndiscoveries, for hitherto that has not been recompensed, but to whatever\r\nmay bring them into notice; these are scholars of the fashionable world,\r\nand such as one knows best.”  Colbert had the true scholar’s taste; he\r\nhad brought Cassini from Italy to take the direction of the new\r\nObservatory; he had ordered surveys for a general map of France; he had\r\nfounded the _Journal des Savants;_ literary men, whether Frenchmen or\r\nforeigners, enjoyed the king’s bounties.  Colbert had even conceived the\r\nplan of a Universal Academy, a veritable forerunner of the Institute.\r\nThe arts were not forgotten in this grand project; the academy of\r\npainting and sculpture dated from the regency of Anne of Austria; the\r\npretensions of the Masters of Arts (maitres is arts), who placed an\r\ninterdict upon artists not belonging to their corporation, had driven\r\nCharles Lebrun, himself the son of a Master, to agitate for its\r\nfoundation; Colbert added to it the academy of music and the academy of\r\narchitecture, and created the French school of painting at Rome.  Beside\r\nthe palace for a long time past dedicated to this establishment, lived,\r\nfor more than thirty-five years, Le Poussin, the first and the greatest\r\nof all the painters of that French school which was beginning to spring\r\nup, whilst the Italian school, though blooming still in talent and\r\nstrength, was forgetting more and more every day the nobleness, the\r\npurity, and the severity of taste which had carried to the highest pitch\r\nthe art of the fifteenth century.  The tradition of the masters in vogue\r\nin Italy, of the Caracci, of Guido, of Paul Veronese, had reached Paris\r\nwith Simon Vouet, who had long lived at Rome.  He was succeeded there by\r\na Frenchman “whom, from his grave and thoughtful air, you would have\r\ntaken for a father of Sorbonne,” says M. Vitet in his charming _Vie de\r\nLesueur_: “his black eye beneath his thick eyebrow nevertheless flashed\r\nforth a glance full of poesy and youth.  His manner of living was not\r\nless surprising than his personal appearance.  He might be seen walking\r\nin the streets of Rome, tablets in hand, hitting off by a stroke or two\r\nof his pencil at one time the antique fragments he came upon, at another\r\nthe gestures, the attitudes, the faces of the persons who presented\r\nthemselves in his path.  Sometimes, in the morning, he would sit on the\r\nterrace of Trinity del Monte, beside another Frenchman five or six years\r\nyounger, but already known for rendering landscapes with such fidelity,\r\nsuch, fresh  and marvellous beauty, that all the Italian masters gave\r\nplace to him, and that, after two centuries, he has not yet met his\r\nrival.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lebrun----674]\r\n\r\n“Of these two artists, the older evidently exercised over the other the\r\nsuperiority which genius has over talent.  The smallest hints of Le\r\nPoussin were received by Claude Lorrain with deference and respect; and\r\nyet, to judge from the prices at which they severally sold their\r\npictures, the landscape painter had for the time an indisputable\r\nsuperiority.”\r\n\r\nClaude Gelee, called Lorrain, had fled when quite young from the shop of\r\nthe confectioner with whom his parents had placed him.  He had found\r\nmeans of getting to Rome; there he worked, there he lived, and there he\r\ndied, returning but once to France, in the height of his renown, for just\r\na few months, without even enriching his own land with any great number\r\nof his works; nearly all, of them remained on foreign soil.  Le Poussin,\r\nborn at the Andelys in 1593, made his way with great difficulty to Italy.\r\nHe was by that time thirty years old, and had no more desire than Claude\r\nto return to France, where painting was with difficulty beginning to\r\nobtain a standing.  His reputation, however, had penetrated thither.\r\nKing Louis XIII. was growing weary of Simon Vouet’s factitious lustre;\r\nhe wanted Le Poussin to go to Paris.  The painter for a long while held\r\nout; the king insisted.  “I shall go,” said Le Poussin, “like one\r\nsentenced to be sawn in halves and severed in twain.”  He passed eighteen\r\nmonths in France, welcomed enthusiastically, lodged at the Tuileries,\r\nmagnificently paid, but exposed to the jealousies of Simon Vouet and his\r\npupils.  Worried, thwarted, frozen to death by the hoarfrosts of Paris,\r\nhe took the road back to Rome in November, 1642, on the pretext of going\r\nto fetch his wife, and did not return any more.  He had left in France\r\nsome of his masterpieces, models of that, new, independent, and\r\nconscientious art, faithfully studied from nature in all its Italian\r\ngrandeur, and from the treasures of the antique.  “How did you arrive at\r\nsuch perfection?” people would ask Le Poussin.  “By neglecting nothing,”\r\n the painter would reply.  In the same way Newton was soon to discover the\r\ngreat laws of the physical world, by always thinking thereon.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Le Poussin and Claude Lorrain----675]\r\n\r\nDuring Le Poussin’s stay at Paris he had taken as a pupil Eustache\r\nLesueur, who had been trained in the studio of Simon Vouet, but had been\r\nstruck from the first with the incomparable genius and proud independence\r\nof the master sent to him by fate.  Alone he had supported Le Poussin in\r\nhis struggle against the envious; alone he entered upon the road which\r\nrevealed itself to him whilst he studied under Le Poussin.  He was poor;\r\nhe had great difficulty in managing to live.  The delicacy, the purity,\r\nthe suavity of his genius could shine forth in their entirety nowhere but\r\nin the convent of the Carthusians, whose cloister he was commissioned to\r\ndecorate.  There he painted the life of St. Bruno, breathing into this\r\nalmost mystical work all the religious poetry of his soul and of his\r\ntalent, ever delicate and chaste even in the allegorical figures of\r\nmythology with which he before long adorned the Hotel Lambert.  He had\r\nreturned to his favorite pursuits, embellishing the churches of Paris\r\nwith incomparable works, when, overwhelmed by the loss of his wife, and\r\nexhausted by the painful efforts of his genius, he died at thirty-seven,\r\nin that convent of the Carthusians which he glorified with his talent, at\r\nthe same time that he edified the monks with his religious zeal.  Lesueur\r\nsuccumbed in a struggle too rude and too rough for his pure and delicate\r\nnature.  Lebrun had returned from that Italy which Lesueur had never been\r\nable to reach; the old rivalry, fostered in the studio of Simon Vouet,\r\nwas already being renewed between the two artists; the angelic art gave\r\nplace to the worldly and the earthly.  Lesueur died; Lebrun found himself\r\nmaster of the position, assured by anticipation, and as it were by\r\ninstinct, of sovereign, dominion under the sway of the young king for\r\nwhom he had been created.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lesueur----676]\r\n\r\nOld Philip of Champagne alone might have disputed with him the foremost\r\nrank.  He had passionately admired Le Poussin, he had attached himself to\r\nLesueur.  “Never,” says M. Vitet, “had he sacrificed to fashion; never\r\nhad he fallen into the vagaries of the degenerate Italian style.”  This\r\nupright, simple, painstaking soul, this inflexible conscience, looking\r\ncontinually into the human face, had preserved in his admirable portraits\r\nthe life and the expression of nature which he was incessantly trying to\r\nseize and reproduce.  Lebrun was preferred to him as first painter to the\r\nking by Louis XIV. himself; Philip of Champagne was delighted thereat; he\r\nlived, in retirement, in fidelity to his friends of Port-Royal, whose\r\naustere and vigorous lineaments he loved to trace, beginning with M. de\r\nSt. Cyran, and ending with his own daughter, Sister Suzanne, who was\r\nrestored to health by the prayers of Mother Agnes Arnauld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mignard  677]\r\n\r\nLebrun was as able a courtier as he was a good painter.  The clever\r\narrangement of his pictures, the richness and brilliancy of his talent,\r\nhis faculty for applying art to industry, secured him with Louis XIV. a\r\nsway which lasted as long as his life.  He was first painter to the king;\r\nhe was director of the Gobelins and of the academy of painting.  “He let\r\nnothing be done by the other artists but according to his own designs and\r\nsuggestions.  The worker in tapestry, the decorative painter, the\r\nstatuary, the goldsmith, took their models from him: all came from him,\r\nall flowed from his brain, all bore his imprint.”  The painter followed\r\nthe king’s ideas, being entirely after his own heart.  For fourteen years\r\nhe worked for Louis XIV., representing his life and his conquests, at\r\nVersailles; painting for the Louvre the victories of Alexander, which\r\nwere engraved almost immediately by Audran and Edelinck.  He was jealous\r\nof the royal favor, sensitive and haughty towards artists, honestly\r\nconcerned for the king’s glory and for the tasks confided to himself.\r\nThe growing reputation of Mignard, whom Louvois had brought back from\r\nRome, troubled and disquieted Lebrun.  In vain did the king encourage\r\nhim.  Lebrun, already ill, said in the presence of Louis XIV. that fine\r\npictures seem to become finer after the painter’s death.  “Do not you be\r\nin a hurry to die, M. Lebrun,” said the king; “we esteem your pictures\r\nnow quite as highly as posterity can.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Perrault  678]\r\n\r\nThe small gallery at Versailles had been intrusted to Mignard.  Lebrun\r\nwithdrew to Montmorency, where he died in 1690, jealous of Mignard at the\r\nend as he had been of Lesueur at the outset of his life.  Mignard became\r\nfirst painter to the king.  He painted the ceiling of Val-de-Grace, which\r\nwas celebrated by Moliere; but it was as a painter of portraits that he\r\nexcelled in France.  “M. Mignard does them best,” said Le Poussin not\r\nlong before, with lofty good nature, “though his heads are all paint,\r\nwithout force or character.”  To Mignard succeeded Rigaud as portrait\r\npainter, worthy to preserve the features of Bossuet and Fenelon.  The\r\nunity of organization, the brilliancy of style, the imposing majesty\r\nwhich the king’s taste had everywhere stamped about him upon art as well\r\nas upon literature, were by this time beginning to decay simultaneously\r\nwith the old age of Louis XIV., with the reverses of his arms, and the\r\nincreasing gloominess of his court; the artists who had illustrated his\r\nreign were dying one after another, as well as the orators and the poets;\r\nthe sculptor James Sarazin had been gone some time; Puget and the\r\nAnguiers were dead, as well as Mansard, Perrault, and Le Notre; Girardon\r\nhad but a few months to live; only Coysevox was destined to survive the\r\nking, whose statue he had many a time moulded.  The great age was\r\ndisappearing slowly and sadly, throwing out to the last some noble\r\ngleams, like the aged king who had constantly served as its centre and\r\nguide, like olden France, which he had crowned with its last and its most\r\nsplendid wreath.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
