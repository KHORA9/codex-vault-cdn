Ritzmann._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH FROM THE THRONE.\r\n\r\nKaiser Wilhelm II., Opening Special Session of the Reichstag in White\r\nRoom of the Royal Palace, Berlin, Aug. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Honored Sirs: It is in an hour fraught with fate that I have\r\n     assembled about me all the representatives of the German people.\r\n     For almost half a century we have been able to keep to the path of\r\n     peace. The attempts to attribute a warlike temperament to Germany\r\n     and to circumscribe its position in the world have often put to\r\n     severe tests the patience of our people. With unswerving honesty,\r\n     my Government, even in provoking circumstances, has pursued as its\r\n     highest aim the development of all moral, spiritual, and economic\r\n     powers. The world has been witness how tirelessly we strove in the\r\n     first rank during the pressure and confusion of the last few years\r\n     to spare the nations of Europe a war between the great powers.\r\n\r\n     The very grave dangers which had arisen owing to the events in the\r\n     Balkans appeared to have been overcome, but then the murder of my\r\n     friend, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, opened up a great abyss. My\r\n     high ally, the Emperor and King Francis Joseph, was compelled to\r\n     take up arms to defend the security of his empire against dangerous\r\n     intrigues from a neighboring State. In the pursuit of her proper\r\n     interests the Dual Monarchy has found her path obstructed by the\r\n     Russian Empire. Not only our duty as an ally calls us to the side\r\n     of Austria-Hungary, but on us falls also the mighty task of\r\n     defending the ancient community of culture of the two kingdoms and\r\n     our own position in the world against the attack of hostile powers.\r\n     With a heavy heart I have been compelled to mobilize my army\r\n     against a neighbor with whom it has fought side by side on so many\r\n     fields of battle. With sincere sorrow I saw a friendship broken of\r\n     which Germany had given faithful proofs. The Imperial Russian\r\n     Government, yielding to the pressure of an insatiable nationalism,\r\n     has taken sides with a State which by encouraging criminal attacks\r\n     has brought on the evil of this war. That France, also, placed\r\n     herself on the side of our enemies could not surprise us. Too often\r\n     have our efforts to arrive at friendlier relations with the French\r\n     Republic come in collision with old hopes and ancient malice.\r\n\r\n     Honored Sirs: What human insight and power could do to arm a people\r\n     against the last extremities has been done with your patriotic\r\n     help. The hostility which has been smouldering for a long time in\r\n     the East and in the West has now burst into bright flames. The\r\n     present situation did not proceed from transient conflicts of\r\n     interest or diplomatic entanglements, it is the result of an ill\r\n     will which has for many years been active against the strength and\r\n     the prosperity of the German Empire. We are not incited by lust for\r\n     conquest, we are inspired by the unyielding determination to keep\r\n     for ourselves and all future generations the place which God has\r\n     given us.\r\n\r\n     From the proofs which have been given you, you will see how my\r\n     Government, and especially my Chancellor, strove up to the last\r\n     moment to avert the worst. We grasp the sword in compulsory\r\n     self-defense, with clean hands and a clean conscience.\r\n\r\n     To the peoples and races of the German Empire my call goes forth to\r\n     defend with all their strength and in brotherly co-operation with\r\n     our ally that which we have created by peaceful labor. After the\r\n     example of our fathers, firmly and faithfully, sincerely and with\r\n     chivalry, humbly before God and battling joyfully before the enemy,\r\n     let us place our trust in the eternal Omnipotence, and may He\r\n     strengthen our defense and bring it to a good end!\r\n\r\n     To you, honored sirs, the whole German people, assembled about its\r\n     Princes and its leaders, look this day. Make your decision\r\n     unanimously and quickly. That is my heartfelt wish.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen (addressing the Deputies directly): You have read what I\r\n     said to my people the other day from the balcony of my castle. I\r\n     repeat now that I no longer know any parties. I know only Germans.\r\n     And in order to testify that you are firmly resolved without\r\n     distinction of party to stand by my side through danger and death,\r\n     I call upon the leaders of the different parties in this House to\r\n     come forward and lay their hands in mine as a pledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GERMAN ARMY AND NAVY.\r\n\r\nProclamation by Kaiser Wilhelm II.\r\n\r\n\r\n     After three and forty years of peace I call the men of Germany to\r\n     arms.\r\n\r\n     It has become necessary to protect our most sacred possessions, the\r\n     Fatherland, our very hearths against ruthless destruction.\r\n\r\n     Enemies on every hand! That is the situation. A mighty struggle, a\r\n     great sacrifice confronts us.\r\n\r\n     I trust that the old spirit of battle still lives on in the German\r\n     people, that powerful spirit of battle which grapples with the foe\r\n     wherever it meets it, be the cost what it may, which has ever been\r\n     the terror and fear of our enemies.\r\n\r\n     Soldiers of Germany, in you I place my trust! In each one of you\r\n     lives the passionate will to conquer, which nothing can subdue.\r\n     Each one of you knows, if need be, how to die a hero's death.\r\n\r\n     Remember our great and glorious past!\r\n\r\n     Remember that you are Germans!\r\n\r\n     God help us!\r\n\r\n     WILHELM.\r\n\r\n     Berlin, Schloss, Aug. 6, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGUSTA VICTORIA,\r\nGerman Empress.\r\n(_Photo from M.E. Burner._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GERMAN WOMEN.\r\n\r\nAn Appeal from the Kaiserin.\r\n\r\n\r\n     On the summons of the Emperor our people are preparing for an\r\n     unprecedented struggle, which it did not invoke and which it is\r\n     only carrying on in its defense. Whoever can bear arms will\r\n     joyfully hasten to the colors to defend the Fatherland with his\r\n     blood. The struggle will be gigantic and the wounds to be healed\r\n     innumerable, therefore I call upon you women and girls of Germany,\r\n     and all to whom it is not given to fight for our beloved home, for\r\n     help. Let every one now do what lies in her power to lighten the\r\n     struggle for our husbands, sons, and brothers. I know that in all\r\n     ranks of our people, without exception, the will exists to fulfill\r\n     this high ideal, but may the Lord God strengthen us in our holy\r\n     work of love, which summons us women to devote all our strength to\r\n     the Fatherland in its decisive struggle.\r\n\r\n     The organizations primarily concerned who should be supported first\r\n     have already sent out notices regarding the mustering of volunteers\r\n     and the collection of gifts of all kinds.\r\n\r\n     AUGUSTE VICTORIA.\r\n\r\n     Berlin, Aug. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"TO THE LAST BREATH OF MAN AND HORSE.\"\r\n\r\nProclamation by Kaiser Wilhelm II.\r\n\r\n     Since the foundation of the empire it has been for forty-three\r\n     years the object of the efforts of myself and my ancestors to\r\n     preserve the peace of the world and to advance by peaceful means\r\n     our vigorous development. But our adversaries were jealous of the\r\n     successes of our work. There has been latent hostility on the east\r\n     and on the west and beyond the sea. It was borne by us till now, as\r\n     we were aware of our responsibility and power. Now, however, these\r\n     adversaries wish to humiliate us, asking that we should look on\r\n     with crossed arms and watch our enemies preparing themselves for a\r\n     coming attack. They will not suffer that we maintain resolute\r\n     fidelity to our ally who is fighting for its position as a great\r\n     power and with whose humiliation our power and honor would equally\r\n     be lost. So the sword must decide.\r\n\r\n     In the midst of perfect peace the enemy surprises us. Therefore to\r\n     arms! Any dallying, any temporizing would be which our fathers\r\n     founded; to be or not to be, is the question for the empire which\r\n     our fathers founded. To be or not to be German power and German\r\n     existence. We shall resist to the last breath of man and horse, and\r\n     shall fight out the struggle even against a world of enemies. Never\r\n     has Germany been subdued when it was united. Forward with God, who\r\n     will be with us as He was with our ancestors!\r\n\r\n     Berlin, Aug. 6. WILHELM.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOY IN GLORIOUS VICTORY.\r\n\r\nSpeech of Kaiser at a Parade During Swift German Advance Toward Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Comrades: I have gathered you around me here in order to take joy\r\n     with you in the glorious victory which our comrades have in several\r\n     days of hot battle won with their swords. Troops out of every nook\r\n     and cranny of the empire helped one another in invincible bravery\r\n     and unshakable loyalty to win great results. There stood together\r\n     under the leadership of the son of the Bavarian King and fought,\r\n     with equal blades, troops of all ages, active, reservists, and\r\n     landwehr.\r\n\r\n     For our victory we are thankful, in the first place, to our God,\r\n     (unserem alten Gott.) He will not desert us, since we stand for a\r\n     holy cause. Many of our comrades have already fallen in battle.\r\n     They died as heroes for the Fatherland. We will think of them with\r\n     honor here, and shout to the honor of those still in the field.\r\n     Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n     We still have many a bloody battle before us. Let us hope for\r\n     further successes like this. We shall not relent, and we shall get\r\n     to the enemy's hide. We shall not lose our faith and trust in our\r\n     good old God up there, (unserem guten alten Gott dort oben.) We are\r\n     determined to win, and we must win.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SUCCESSFUL BATTLE.\r\n\r\nTelegram from Kaiser Wilhelm II. to Chief of Troops in Upper Alsace,\r\nAug. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Grateful to God, Who was with us.

I have drawn the sword, which without victory and\r\n     without honor I cannot sheath again. All of you will see to it that\r\n     only in honor is it returned to the scabbard.

With a heart filled\r\n     with gratitude my first thoughts turn to those who since 1870-71\r\n     have worked quietly upon the development of an organization which\r\n     has emerged from its first serious test with such glorious success.\r\n     To all who have co-operated with them I wish to express my imperial\r\n     thanks for their loyal devotion to duty in making possible in\r\n     obedience to my call the transportation of armed masses of German\r\n     troops against my enemies. The present achievement [near Metz]\r\n     convinces me that the railways of the country will be equal to the\r\n     heaviest demands that might be made upon them during the course of\r\n     the gigantic struggle in which we are engaged for the future of the\r\n     German Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF THE MEN.\r\n\r\nKaiser's Telegram from Dresden to the King of Saxony, Oct. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I am very glad to be able to send you the best reports of the\r\n     Nineteenth Army Corps and the Twelfth Reserve Corps. I visited\r\n     yesterday the Third Army and greeted especially the brave 181st\r\n     Regiment, to which I expressed my recognition. I found your third\r\n     son and your brother Max as well as Laffert and Kirchbach in the\r\n     best of health. The spirit among the men is splendid. With such an\r\n     army we shall be able to complete victoriously the rest of our\r\n     difficult task.

The interview as recorded by the\r\n\"representative Englishman\" was as follows:_\r\n\r\n     Moments sometimes occur in the history of nations when a calculated\r\n     indiscretion proves of the highest public service. It is for this\r\n     reason that I have decided to make known the substance of a lengthy\r\n     conversation which it was my recent privilege to have with the\r\n     Emperor.\r\n\r\n     I do so in the hope that it will help to remove that obstinate\r\n     misconception of the character of the Emperor's feelings toward\r\n     England, which I fear is deeply rooted in the ordinary Englishman's\r\n     breast. It is the Emperor's sincere wish that it should be\r\n     eradicated. He has given repeated proofs of his desire by word and\r\n     deed. But, to speak frankly, his patience is sorely tried now; he\r\n     finds himself so continually misrepresented and has so often\r\n     experienced the mortification of finding that any momentary\r\n     improvement in relations is followed by renewed outbursts of\r\n     prejudice and a prompt return to the old attitude of suspicion.\r\n\r\n     His Majesty spoke with impulsive and unusual frankness, saying:\r\n     \"You English are as mad, mad, mad as March hares. What has come\r\n     over you that you are completely given over to suspicions that are\r\n     quite unworthy of a great nation? What more can I do than I have\r\n     done? I declared with all the emphasis at my command in my speech\r\n     at the Guildhall that my heart was set upon peace and that it was\r\n     one of my dearest wishes to live on the best terms with England.\r\n     Have I ever been false to my word? Falsehood and prevarication are\r\n     alien to my nature. My actions ought to speak for themselves, but\r\n     you will not listen to them, but to those who misinterpret and\r\n     distort them.\"\r\n\r\nResents a Personal Insult.\r\n\r\n     \"This is a personal insult which I resent; to be forever misjudged,\r\n     to have my repeated offers of friendship weighed and scrutinized\r\n     with jealous, mistrustful eyes taxes my patience severely. I have\r\n     said time after time that I am a friend of England, and your press,\r\n     or at least a considerable section of it, bids the people of\r\n     England to refuse my proffered hand and insinuates that the other\r\n     hand holds a dagger. How can I convince a nation against its will?\"\r\n\r\n     Complaining again of the difficulty imposed on him by English\r\n     distrust, his Majesty said: \"The prevailing sentiment of large\r\n     sections of the middle and lower classes of my own people is not\r\n     friendly to England. I am, therefore, so to speak, in the minority\r\n     in my own land, but it is a minority of the best element, just as\r\n     it is in England respecting Germany.\"\r\n\r\n     The Englishman reminded the Kaiser that not only England but the\r\n     whole of Europe viewed with disapproval the recent sending of the\r\n     German Consul at Algiers to Fez and forestalling France and Spain\r\n     by suggesting the recognition of Sultan Mulai Hafid. The Kaiser\r\n     made an impatient gesture and exclaimed: \"Yes? that is an excellent\r\n     example of the way German actions are misrepresented,\" and with\r\n     vivid directness he defended the aforesaid incident, as the German\r\n     Government has already done.\r\n\r\n     The interviewer reminded the Kaiser that an important and\r\n     influential section of the German newspapers interpreted these acts\r\n     very differently, and effusively approved of them because they\r\n     indicated that Germany was bent upon shaping events in Morocco.\r\n\r\n     \"There are mischief makers,\" replied the Emperor, \"in both\r\n     countries. I will not attempt to weigh their relative capacity for\r\n     misrepresentation, but the facts are as I have stated. There has\r\n     been nothing in Germany's recent action in regard to Morocco\r\n     contrary to the explicit declaration of my love of peace made both\r\n     at the Guildhall and in my latest speech at Strassburg.\"\r\n\r\nKaiser and the Boer War.\r\n\r\nReverting to his efforts to show his friendship for England, the Kaiser\r\nsaid they had not been confined to words. It was commonly believed that\r\nGermany was hostile to England throughout the Boer war. Undoubtedly the\r\nnewspapers were hostile and public opinion was hostile. \"But what,\" he\r\nasked, \"of official Germany? What brought to a sudden stop, indeed, to\r\nan absolute collapse, the European tour of the Boer delegates, who were\r\nstriving to obtain European intervention?\"\r\n\r\n     \"They were fêted in Holland. France gave them a rapturous welcome.\r\n     They wished to come to Berlin, where the German people would have\r\n     crowned them with flowers, but when they asked me to receive them I\r\n     refused. The agitation immediately died away and the delegates\r\n     returned empty handed. Was that the action of a secret enemy?\r\n\r\n     \"Again, when the struggle was at its height, the German Government\r\n     was invited by France and Russia to join them in calling upon\r\n     England to end the war. The moment had come, they said, not only to\r\n     save the Boer republics, but also to humiliate England to the dust.\r\n     What was my reply? I said so far from Germany joining in any\r\n     concerted European action to bring pressure against England and\r\n     bring about her downfall Germany would always keep aloof from\r\n     politics that could bring her into complications with a sea power\r\n     like England.\r\n\r\n     \"Posterity will one day read the exact terms of a telegram, now in\r\n     the archives of Windsor Castle, in which I informed the sovereign\r\n     of England of the answer I returned to the powers which then sought\r\n     to compass her fall. Englishmen who now insult me by doubting my\r\n     word should know what my actions were in the hour of their\r\n     adversity.\r\n\r\n     \"Nor was that all. During your black week in December, 1899, when\r\n     disasters followed one another in rapid succession, I received a\r\n     letter from Queen Victoria, my revered grandmother, written in\r\n     sorrow and affliction and bearing manifest traces of the anxieties\r\n     which were preying upon her mind and health. I at once returned a\r\n     sympathetic reply. I did more. I bade one of my officers to procure\r\n     as exact an account as he could obtain of the number of combatants\r\n     on both sides and the actual positions of the opposing forces.\r\n\r\n     \"With the figures before me I worked out what I considered the best\r\n     plan of campaign in the circumstances and submitted it to my\r\n     General Staff for criticism. Then I dispatched it to England. That\r\n     document likewise is among the State papers at Windsor awaiting the\r\n     serenely impartial verdict of history.\r\n\r\n     \"Let me add as a curious coincidence that the plan which I\r\n     formulated ran very much on the same lines as that actually adopted\r\n     by Gen. Roberts and carried by him into successful operation. Was\r\n     that the act of one who wished England ill? Let Englishmen be just\r\n     and say.\"\r\n\r\nThe German Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTouching then upon the English conviction that Germany is increasing her\r\nnavy for the purpose of attacking Great Britain, the Kaiser reiterated\r\nthe explanation that Chancellor von Bülow and other Ministers have made\r\nfamiliar, dwelling upon Germany's worldwide commerce, her manifold\r\ninterests in distant seas, and the necessity for being prepared to\r\nprotect them. He said:\r\n\r\n     \"Patriotic Germans refuse to assign any bounds to their legitimate\r\n     commercial ambitions. They expect their interests to go on growing.\r\n     They must be able to champion them manfully in any quarter of the\r\n     globe. Germany looks ahead. Her horizons stretch far away. She must\r\n     be prepared for any eventualities in the Far East. Who can foresee\r\n     what may take place in the Pacific in the days to come, days not so\r\n     distant as some believe, but days, at any rate, for which all\r\n     European powers with Far Eastern interests ought to steadily\r\n     prepare?\r\n\r\n     \"Look at the accomplished rise of Japan. Think of a possible\r\n     national awakening in China, and then judge of the vast problems of\r\n     the Pacific. Only those powers which have great navies will be\r\n     listened to with respect when the future of the Pacific comes to be\r\n     solved, and if for that reason only Germany must have a powerful\r\n     fleet. It may even be that England herself will be glad that\r\n     Germany has a fleet when they speak together in the great debates\r\n     of the future.\"\r\n\r\nThe interviewer concludes:\r\n\r\n     \"The Emperor spoke with all that earnestness which marks his manner\r\n     when speaking on deeply pondered subjects. I ask my\r\n     fellow-countrymen who value the cause of peace to weigh what I have\r\n     written and revise, if necessary, their estimate of the Kaiser and\r\n     his friendship for England by his Majesty's own words. If they had\r\n     enjoyed the privilege of hearing them spoken they would no longer\r\n     doubt either his Majesty's firm desire to live on the best of terms\r\n     with England or his growing impatience at the persistent mistrust\r\n     with which his offer of friendship is too often received.\"\r\n\r\nThe Consequences.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 17 following Prince von Bülow met the Kaiser at Kiel, taking\r\nwith him evidence of the feeling in Germany regarding the Emperor's\r\npublished interview and setting forth:\r\n\r\n     First, that the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bundesrat, or\r\n     Federal Council, is firm in the opinion formulated at the meeting\r\n     held yesterday that it would be wiser for the Emperor not to\r\n     express views affecting the relations of the empire with other\r\n     countries except through his responsible Ministers. This\r\n     expression, derives weight from the fact that the Governments of\r\n     Bavaria, Württemberg, and Saxony were represented on the committee.\r\n\r\n     Second, that the entire Reichstag assented to the declarations made\r\n     by the speakers on Tuesday that the Emperor had exceeded his\r\n     constitutional prerogatives in private discussion with foreigners\r\n     concerning Germany's attitude on controverted questions.\r\n\r\n     Third, that the feeling of the people at large on this matter was\r\n     accurately indicated by the press of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser's reply was published on the same date in the Reichsanzeiger,\r\nin the form of a communication, which read:\r\n\r\n     During today's audience granted to the Imperial Chancellor, his\r\n     Majesty, the Emperor and King, listened for several hours to a\r\n     report by Prince von Bülow. The Imperial Chancellor described the\r\n     feeling and its causes among the German people in connection with\r\n     the article published in The Daily Telegraph. He also explained the\r\n     position he had taken during the course of the debates and\r\n     interpellations on this subject in the Reichstag. His Majesty the\r\n     Emperor received the statements and explanations with great\r\n     earnestness, and then expressed his will as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Heedless of the exaggerations of public criticism, which are\r\n     regarded by him as incorrect, his Majesty perceives that his\r\n     principal imperial task is to insure the stability of the policies\r\n     of the empire, under the guardianship of constitutional\r\n     responsibilities. In conformity therewith, his Majesty the Emperor\r\n     approves the Chancellor's utterances in the Reichstag, and assures\r\n     Prince von Bülow of his continued confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILHELM II.'S LETTER TO LORD TWEEDMOUTH.\r\n\r\nPublished by The Morning Post of London, Oct. 30, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjoined letter written to the late Lord Tweedmouth by the German\r\nEmperor is made public for the first time. It is a literal transcript of\r\nthe original document in which occur a few slight errors in spelling.\r\nThe existence of the document was first made known to the public by the\r\nmilitary correspondent of The Times, who published a letter on the\r\nsubject on March 6, 1908, but its contents were not divulged.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the letter can be understood only in the light of\r\nthe naval and political situation six years ago. During the preceding\r\nyear, 1907, The Hague Conference, ostensibly convened in the interests\r\nof international peace, had resolved itself into a committee to\r\ndetermine how to diminish the severities of war. There was a section of\r\nopinion in this country which was persuaded that the only method of\r\nseeking peace was to reduce the navy and army. At the same time the\r\nImperial German Navy was making swift and steady progress, and its\r\nmenace to British supremacy aroused considerable alarm in this country.\r\nAlthough the British Navy held superiority over the German Navy in ships\r\nnot of the dreadnought type, the balance in dreadnoughts was virtually\r\neven.\r\n\r\nDreadnought Supremacy.\r\n\r\nIt was stated in Parliament that in the year 1916 Germany, according to\r\nher naval law, would have thirty-six dreadnoughts, a number which would\r\ninvolve the building by this country of forty-four such vessels in the\r\nsame period, toward which the Government was only providing two in the\r\ncurrent year. It was also stated that in the year 1911 Germany would\r\npossess thirteen dreadnoughts and Great Britain only twelve, which\r\nstatement was founded upon reasonable assumptions. Could Germany reckon\r\nupon the continuance of such a relative position, the advantage to her\r\nwould be very great.\r\n\r\nIt was at this critical moment that the German Emperor indited his\r\nletter to the First Lord of the Admiralty, which is printed below. When\r\nthe fact became known there was a good deal of public feeling aroused\r\nboth in this country and abroad. Lord Tweedmouth stated that the letter\r\nwas a private letter and purely personal. Prince von Bülow informed the\r\nReichstag that the letter was of both a private and political character,\r\nadding some remarks concerning the \"purely defensive character of our\r\nnaval programme which,\" said the Chancellor, \"cannot be emphasized too\r\nfrequently.\"\r\n\r\nThe German Foreign Office officially announced that \"in his letter the\r\nEmperor merely corrected certain erroneous views prevalent in England\r\nregarding the development of the German fleet.\"\r\n\r\nReaders are now in a position to judge for themselves the accuracy of\r\nthese statements. It should be remembered that the reduced navy\r\nestimates of 1908-9 were followed by national alarm and the publication\r\nof Admiral Lord Charles Beresford's shipbuilding programme and large\r\nincrease in estimates of the following year. Here is the letter:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser's Letter.\r\n\r\n     Berlin, 14th-2, 1908.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Lord Tweedmouth--May I intrude on your precious time and\r\n     ask for a few moments' attention to these lines I venture to submit\r\n     to you? I see by the daily papers and reviews that a battle royal\r\n     is being fought about the needs of the navy. I therefore venture to\r\n     furnish you with some information anent the German naval programme,\r\n     which it seems is being quoted by all parties to further their ends\r\n     by trying to frighten peaceable British taxpayers with it as a\r\n     bogy.\r\n\r\n     During my last pleasant visit to your hospitable shores I tried to\r\n     make your authorities understand what the drift of German naval\r\n     policy is, but I am afraid that my explanations have been either\r\n     misunderstood or not believed, because I see \"German danger\" and\r\n     \"German challenge to British naval supremacy\" constantly quoted in\r\n     different articles. This phrase, if not repudiated or corrected,\r\n     sown broadcast over the country and daily dinned into British ears,\r\n     might in the end create the most deplorable results.\r\n\r\n     I therefore deem it advisable, as Admiral of the Fleet, to lay some\r\n     facts before you to enable you to see clearly that it is absolutely\r\n     nonsensical and untrue that the German naval bill is to provide a\r\n     navy meant as a challenge to British naval supremacy. The German\r\n     fleet is built against nobody at all; it is solely built for\r\n     Germany's needs in relation with that country's rapidly growing\r\n     trade. The German naval bill was sanctioned by the Imperial\r\n     Parliament and published ten years ago, and may be had at any large\r\n     bookseller's. There is nothing surprising, secret, or underhand in\r\n     it, and every reader may study the whole course mapped out for the\r\n     development of the German Navy with the greatest ease.\r\n\r\nThirty to Forty Battleships in 1920.\r\n\r\n     The law is being adhered to, and provides for about thirty to forty\r\n     ships of the line in 1920. The number of ships fixed by the bill\r\n     included the fleet then actually in commission, notwithstanding its\r\n     material being already old and far surpassed by contemporary types.\r\n     In other foreign navies the extraordinary rapidity with which\r\n     improvements were introduced in types of battleships, armaments,\r\n     and armor made the fleet in commission obsolete before the building\r\n     programme providing additions to it was half finished.\r\n\r\n     The obsolete fleet had to be struck off the list, thus leaving a\r\n     gap, lowering the number of ships below the standard prescribed by\r\n     the bill. This gap was stopped by using the finished ships to\r\n     replace the obsolete ones instead of being added to them as\r\n     originally intended. Therefore, instead of steadily increasing the\r\n     standing fleet by regular additions it came to a wholesale\r\n     rebuilding of the entire German Navy. Our actual programme in\r\n     course of execution is practically only the exchange of old\r\n     material for new, but not an addition to the number of units\r\n     originally laid down by the bill of ten years ago, which is being\r\n     adhered to.\r\n\r\n     It seems to me that the main fault in the discussions going on in\r\n     the papers is the permanent ventilating of so-called two to three\r\n     or more power standard and then only exemplifying on one power,\r\n     which is invariably Germany. It is fair to suppose that each nation\r\n     builds and commissions its navy according to its needs and not only\r\n     with regard to the programme of other countries. Therefore, it\r\n     would be the simplest thing for England to say: \"I have a\r\n     world-wide empire and the greatest trade of the world, and to\r\n     protect them I must have so and so many battleships, cruisers, &c.,\r\n     as are necessary to guarantee the supremacy of the sea to me, and\r\n     they shall, accordingly, be built and manned.\"\r\n\r\n     That is the absolute right of your country, and nobody anywhere\r\n     would lose a word about it, and whether it be 60 or 90 or 100\r\n     battleships, that would make no difference and certainly no change\r\n     in the German naval bill. May the numbers be as you think fit,\r\n     everybody here would understand it, but the people would be very\r\n     thankful over here if at last Germany was left out of the\r\n     discussion, for it is very galling to the Germans to see their\r\n     country continually held up as the sole danger and menace to Great\r\n     Britain by the whole press of the different contending parties,\r\n     considering that other countries are building, too, and there are\r\n     even larger fleets than the German.\r\n\r\nFears German Retaliation.\r\n\r\n     Doubtless, when party faction runs high there is often a lamentable\r\n     lack of discrimination in the choice of weapons, but I really must\r\n     protest that the German naval programme should be only one for her\r\n     exclusive use, or that such a poisoned view should be forged as a\r\n     German challenge to British supremacy of the sea. If permanently\r\n     used mischief may be created at home, and the injured feeling\r\n     engendering the wish for retaliation in the circle of the German\r\n     Naval League as a representative of the nation which would\r\n     influence public opinion and place the Government in a very\r\n     disagreeable position by trying to force it to change its programme\r\n     through undue pressure, difficult to ignore.\r\n\r\n     In a letter which Lord Esher caused to be published a short time\r\n     ago he wrote that every German, from the Emperor down to the last\r\n     man, wished for the downfall of Sir John Fisher. Now I am at a loss\r\n     to tell whether the supervision of the foundations and drains of\r\n     royal palaces is apt to qualify somebody for the judgment of naval\r\n     affairs in general. As far as regards German affairs, the phrase is\r\n     a piece of unmitigated balderdash, and has created immense\r\n     merriment in the circles of those here who know. But I venture to\r\n     think that such things ought not to be written by people who are\r\n     high placed, as they are liable to hurt public feelings over here.\r\n\r\n     Of course I need not assure you that nobody here dreams of wishing\r\n     to influence Great Britain in the choice of those to whom she means\r\n     to give the direction of her navy or to disturb them in the\r\n     fulfillment of their noble task. It is expected that the choice\r\n     will always fall on the best and ablest, and their deeds will be\r\n     followed with interest and admiration by their brother officers in\r\n     the German Navy.\r\n\r\n     It is, therefore, preposterous to infer that the German authorities\r\n     work for or against persons in official positions in foreign\r\n     countries. It is as ridiculous as it is untrue, and I hereby\r\n     repudiate such calumny. Besides, to my humble notion, this\r\n     perpetual quoting of the German danger is utterly unworthy of the\r\n     great British Nation, with its world-wide empire and mighty navy.\r\n     There is something nearly ludicrous about it. The foreigners in\r\n     other countries might easily conclude that Germans must be an\r\n     exceptionally strong lot, as they seem to be able to strike terror\r\n     into the hearts of the British, who are five times their superiors.\r\n\r\n     I hope your Lordship will read these lines with kind consideration.\r\n     They are written by one who is an ardent admirer of your splendid\r\n     navy, who wishes it all success, and who hopes that its ensign may\r\n     ever wave on the same side as the German Navy's, and by one who is\r\n     proud to wear a British naval uniform of Admiral of the Fleet,\r\n     which was conferred on him by the late great Queen of blessed\r\n     memory.\r\n\r\n     Once more the German naval bill is not aimed at England and is not\r\n     a challenge to British supremacy of the sea, which will remain\r\n     unchallenged for generations to come. Let us all remember the\r\n     warning Admiral Sir John Fisher gave to his hearers in November,\r\n     when so cleverly he cautioned them not to get scared by using the\r\n     admirable phrase \"if Eve had not always kept her eye on the apple\r\n     she would not have eaten it, and we should not now be bothered with\r\n     clothes.\"\r\n\r\n     I remain yours truly,\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM I. R.,\r\n     Admiral of the Fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttacks Kaiser's Veracity.\r\n\r\nThe Morning Post, commenting on the letter of the Kaiser, says:\r\n\r\n     It is not usual for an Emperor to address a Minister of a foreign\r\n     country with reference to the affairs of his department. It is a\r\n     fact that it is not done. Lord Tweedmouth said the letter was a\r\n     private letter. The German Chancellor, Prince von Bülow, said the\r\n     letter partook of both a private and a political character. The\r\n     fact remains that it involved an extraordinary breach of etiquette.\r\n     There is no reflection cast upon the late Lord Tweedmouth. No one\r\n     can help receiving a letter from an Emperor if that monarch\r\n     condescends to dispatch it. Few persons, perhaps, could help being\r\n     influenced, albeit unconsciously influenced, by the perusal of such\r\n     an epistle.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps the German Emperor reflected upon that psychological\r\n     contingency; for to what conclusion is the whole tenor of the\r\n     letter directed? That the German Navy existed solely for purposes\r\n     of defense in case of aggression and for the protection of German\r\n     commerce, and that it was no part of German policy, and never had\r\n     been, to menace the sea power of Britain.\r\n\r\n     Now turn to the notorious preamble of the German navy law of 1900,\r\n     which in his letter the Emperor cites as a guarantee of good faith.\r\n     It is there stated that the German Navy must be made so powerful\r\n     that it would be dangerous for any nation, even the strongest\r\n     maritime nation, to attack it.\r\n\r\n     If that is not a challenge, what is? Had it not been in terms a\r\n     challenge the preamble would surely have run that it was not the\r\n     intention to make the German Navy so strong that the strongest\r\n     naval power could not attack it without danger to that power.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mighty Fate of Europe\r\n\r\nAs Interpreted by Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, German Imperial\r\nChancellor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"YOUR HEARTS FOR GOD, YOUR FISTS ON THE ENEMY.\"\r\n\r\nSpeech from Balcony of Chancellor's Official Residence,\r\nBerlin, Aug. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n     At this serious hour in order to give expression to your feelings\r\n     for your Fatherland you have come to the house of Bismarck, who\r\n     with Emperor William the Great and Field Marshal von Moltke welded\r\n     the German Empire for us.\r\n\r\n     We wished to go on living in peace in the empire which we have\r\n     developed in forty-four years of peaceful labor.\r\n\r\n     The whole work of Emperor William has been devoted to the\r\n     maintenance of peace.

VON BETHMANN-HOLLWEG,\r\nGerman Imperial Chancellor.\r\n(_Photo from Brown Brothers._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARES FOR WAR.[01]\r\n\r\nSpeech Delivered in the Reichstag, Berlin, Afternoon of Aug. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A mighty fate has descended upon Europe. Because we were struggling\r\n     for the esteem of the German Empire in the world, we have for\r\n     forty-four years lived in peace and safeguarded the peace of\r\n     Europe. In peaceful industry we have become strong and mighty and\r\n     in consequence envied. With patience we have borne that, under the\r\n     pretext that Germany was desirous of war, hostility toward us was\r\n     being nursed and chains forged for us both in the East and in the\r\n     West.\r\n\r\n     We wished to continue to live in peaceful industry, and, like an\r\n     unexpressed vow, there was passed on from Kaiser to the youngest\r\n     soldier: \"Only in defense of a righteous cause shall our sword be\r\n     drawn.\" (Hearty applause.) The day when we must draw it has\r\n     appeared, contrary to our desire, contrary to our honest efforts to\r\n     avoid it. Russia has applied the firebrand to the house. We find\r\n     ourselves in a forced war with Russia and France.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, a series of documents, composed in the rush of events,\r\n     is in your hands. Allow me to place before you the facts which\r\n     characterize our attitude.\r\n\r\n     From the very beginning of the Austrian conflict we strove and\r\n     worked toward the end that this trouble remain confined to\r\n     Austria-Hungary and Servia. All Cabinets, especially that of\r\n     England, take the same stand; only Russia declares that she must\r\n     have a word in the decision of this conflict. Therewith the danger\r\n     of European entanglements arises. As soon as the first authentic\r\n     reports of the military preparations in Russia reached us we\r\n     declared in a friendly but emphatic manner in St. Petersburg that\r\n     war measures and military preparations would force us also to\r\n     prepare, and that mobilization is closely akin to war.\r\n\r\n     Russia asserts in what is an apparently friendly manner that she is\r\n     not mobilizing against us. In the meantime England tries to mediate\r\n     between Vienna and St. Petersburg, in which she is warmly supported\r\n     by us. On July 28 the Kaiser telegraphed the Czar, asking him to\r\n     consider that Austria-Hungary has the right and that it is her duty\r\n     to defend herself against Servian intrigues, which threaten to\r\n     undermine her existence. The Kaiser called the attention of the\r\n     Czar to their common monarchical interests with regard to the\r\n     Serajevo outrage, and asked him personally to support him in order\r\n     to establish harmony between Vienna and St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n     At about the same hour in which this telegram was sent the Czar\r\n     asked the Kaiser for his support and requested him to advise Vienna\r\n     to be moderate in its demands. The Kaiser assumed the role of\r\n     mediator. Hardly had he begun his activity when Russia mobilized\r\n     its entire fighting force against Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary,\r\n     however, had mobilized only those army corps which were directed\r\n     against Servia; in the north there were only two army corps and\r\n     these far from the Russian border.\r\n\r\n     The Kaiser immediately called the attention of the Czar to the fact\r\n     that this mobilization of his forces against Austria-Hungary made\r\n     his position as mediator difficult or absolutely impossible. In\r\n     spite of this we continued our mediatorial activities in Vienna,\r\n     going to the utmost limits of consistency with the terms of our\r\n     federal treaty. [\"Very true! Hear, hear!\"] During this time Russia\r\n     again spontaneously assured us that her military preparations were\r\n     not directed against us. [\"Hear, hear, fie!\"]\r\n\r\n     The 31st of July arrived. In Vienna the decision was to be made. In\r\n     the meantime we had succeeded with our negotiations to reaching a\r\n     point where Vienna resumed intercourse with St. Petersburg, which\r\n     for some time had been discontinued, but before the final decision\r\n     was reached in Vienna the news arrived that Russia had mobilized\r\n     its entire fighting force, which meant also against us. [\"Hear,\r\n     hear!\"]\r\n\r\nRussia's Mobilization.\r\n\r\n     The Russian Government, which from repeated admonitions knew what\r\n     mobilizing on our borders meant, did not notify us of this\r\n     mobilization and gave us absolutely no explanation. [\"Hear! hear!\"]\r\n     Not until the afternoon of July 31 did the Kaiser receive a message\r\n     from the Czar in which he assured him that the attitude of his army\r\n     was not hostile toward us. [\"Hear! hear!\" and laughter.]\r\n\r\n     However, the mobilization against us on the Russian border was on\r\n     the night of July 31 already in full progress. While we, at the\r\n     request of Russia, were mediating in Vienna, the Russian Army\r\n     appeared on our long, almost entirely open border. France, although\r\n     not yet mobilizing, was making preparations for war. And we, up to\r\n     this point, had intentionally not then called a single soldier of\r\n     the reserve, for the sake of European peace. [\"Bravo!\"]\r\n\r\n     Should we continue to wait with patience until the powers by which\r\n     we are surrounded choose the moment for attack? [\"No!\"] To expose\r\n     Germany to this danger would have been criminal! [Stormy,\r\n     concerted, prolonged \"Very true and bravo!\"--also from the Social\r\n     Democrats.] Therefore, on July 31 we demanded that Russia\r\n     demobilize, this being the only measure which could save the peace\r\n     of Europe. [Hearty approval.] The Imperial Ambassador received,\r\n     furthermore, the order to declare to the Russian Government that in\r\n     case they did not comply with our demands they should consider that\r\n     a state of war exists.\r\n\r\n     The Imperial Ambassador performed this mission. Up till the present\r\n     we have not learned Russia's answer to this demand. [\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\n     Telegraphic reports concerning it have not yet reached us, although\r\n     the wire still transmits less important messages. [\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\n     Therefore, on Aug. 1, at 5 o'clock, when the appointed period of\r\n     grace was long past, the Kaiser considered it necessary to\r\n     mobilize.\r\n\r\n     At the same time we had to make sure of the position France would\r\n     take. To our direct question whether in case of a German-Russian\r\n     war she would remain neutral, France answered that she would do\r\n     what she had to do in her own interests. [Laughter.] That was an\r\n     evasive if not a negative answer to our question.\r\n\r\nDeclares France Began War.\r\n\r\n     In spite of this the Kaiser gave the order that the French border\r\n     should be respected. The command was strictly enforced, with a\r\n     single exception. France, which mobilized simultaneously with us,\r\n     declared that she would respect a zone of ten kilometers from the\r\n     border. [\"Hear, hear!\"] And what happened in reality? There were\r\n     bomb-throwing flyers, cavalry patrols, invading companies in the\r\n     Reichsland, Alsace-Lorraine. [\"Unheard of!\"] Thereby France,\r\n     although the condition of war had not yet been declared, had\r\n     attacked our territory.\r\n\r\n     Concerning the French complaints in regard to violations of the\r\n     border, I have received from the Chief of the General Staff the\r\n     following report: Only one offense has been committed. Contrary to\r\n     an emphatic order a patrol of the Fourteenth Army Corps, led by an\r\n     officer, crossed the border on Aug. 2. They apparently were killed.\r\n     Only one man returned. However, long before the crossing of the\r\n     border French flyers were dropping bombs in Southern Germany, and\r\n     at Schluchtpass the French troops had attacked our border troops.\r\n\r\n     Until the present our troops have confined their activity to the\r\n     protection of our borders. They are now on the defense, and\r\n     necessity recognizes no law. [\"Very true!\"]\r\n\r\n     Our troops have occupied Luxemburg, and perhaps have also found it\r\n     necessary to enter Belgian territory. [Hearty applause.] This is\r\n     contrary to international law. The French Government has declared\r\n     in Brussels they will respect the neutrality of Belgium as long as\r\n     she respects the opponent. We knew, however, that France was ready\r\n     to invade Belgium. [\"Hear, hear!\"] France could wait; we, however,\r\n     could not, because a French invasion in our lower Rhein flank\r\n     would have proved fatal.\r\n\r\n     So we were forced to disregard the protests of the Luxemburg and\r\n     Belgian Governments. We shall try to make good the injustice we\r\n     have committed as soon as our military goal has been reached.\r\n     [Applause.] Who like we are fighting for the highest, must only\r\n     consider how victory can be gained. [Enthusiastic applause in\r\n     entire house.]\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, we are standing shoulder to shoulder with\r\n     Austria-Hungary. With reference to England, the declaration which\r\n     Sir Edward Grey made in the House of Commons yesterday plainly\r\n     shows our attitude. We have assured England that as long as she\r\n     remains neutral our fleet will not attack the northern coast of\r\n     France and that the territorial integrity and independence of\r\n     Belgium will not be violated. This declaration I repeat before the\r\n     whole world, and I can add that so long as England remains neutral\r\n     we are prepared in case of reciprocity to refrain from all hostile\r\n     operations against French merchant vessels. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, so much for the events. I repeat the words of the\r\n     Kaiser: \"With a clear conscience Germany goes to the battlefield.\"\r\n     [Enthusiastic approval.] We are fighting for the fruits of our\r\n     peaceful industry, for the inheritance of a great past, and for our\r\n     future.\r\n\r\n     The fifty years of which Moltke spoke, and in which we should stand\r\n     armed and ready to protect our inheritance and the acquisitions of\r\n     1870, have not yet passed. The hour of trial for the German nation\r\n     has struck, but we are facing it with confidence. [Stormy\r\n     approval.]\r\n\r\n     Our army is in the field, our fleet is ready for battle, and behind\r\n     it stands the entire German Nation. [Enthusiastic applause from the\r\n     entire house.] The entire nation! [with a gesture particularly\r\n     directed toward the Social Democrats. Renewed applause, in which\r\n     the Social Democrats also joined.] You, gentlemen, realize your\r\n     duty in its entirety. The question needs no further consideration,\r\n     and I request speedy action. [Enthusiastic applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[01] The Times of London contained on Aug. 12, 1914, the following:\r\n\r\n\"The statement made by the German Imperial Chancellor to the Reichstag\r\non Aug. 4, which we published yesterday and reproduce below, lends\r\npiquancy to a communication that reached us from an influential quarter\r\nin Germany on Aug. 2. The communication, which we give in its original\r\nform, bore the name of a personage holding a prominent position in\r\nGermany, and standing in a close personal relationship to the German\r\nEmperor. It was evidently timed for publication on the morning of Aug.\r\n3, the day of Sir Edward Grey's historic speech in the House of\r\nCommons\":\r\n\r\n     Aug. 2, 1914.\r\n\r\n     I hear with astonishment that in France and elsewhere in the world\r\n     it is imagined that Germany wants to carry on an aggressive war,\r\n     and that she had with this aim brought about the present situation.\r\n     It is said that the Emperor was of the opinion that the moment had\r\n     come to have a final reckoning with his enemies; but what a\r\n     terrible error that is! Whoever knows the Emperor as I do, whoever\r\n     knows how very seriously he takes the responsibility of the crown,\r\n     how his moral ideas are rooted in true religious feeling, must be\r\n     astonished that any one could attribute such motives to him.\r\n\r\n     He has not wanted the war; it has been forced upon him by the might\r\n     of the circumstances. He has worked unswervingly to keep the peace,\r\n     and has together with England thrown his whole influence into the\r\n     scales to find a peaceful solution, in order to save his people\r\n     from the horrors of war. But everything has been wrecked upon the\r\n     attitude of Russia, which in the middle of negotiations which\r\n     offered good outlook of success mobilized her forces, wherewith she\r\n     proved that she did not mean in earnest what her assurances of\r\n     peaceful intentions indicated.\r\n\r\n     Now Germany's frontiers are menaced by Russia which drags her\r\n     allies into the war, now Germany's honor is at stake. Is it\r\n     possible under these circumstances that the most peace-loving\r\n     monarch can do otherwise than take to the sword in order to defend\r\n     the most sacred interests of the nation?\r\n\r\n     And, finally, the German people! In them is firmly rooted the word\r\n     of Prince Bismarck against aggressive wars: \"One must not try to\r\n     look into the cards of Fate.\"\r\n\r\n     It must be stated again: Russia alone forces the war upon Europe.\r\n     Russia alone must carry the full weight of responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT TO AMERICA.\r\n\r\nIssued to The Associated Press from General Headquarters, Sept. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I do not know what is thought of this war in America. I assume\r\n     there have been published in America the telegrams exchanged\r\n     between the German Emperor, the Emperor of Russia, and the King of\r\n     England, containing the history of the events that preceded the\r\n     outbreak of the war, and which bears irrefutable testimony of how\r\n     the Emperor, until the last moment, strove hard to preserve the\r\n     peace.\r\n\r\n     These efforts had to be futile, as Russia, under all circumstances,\r\n     had resolved upon war, and as England, which for decades had\r\n     encouraged the anti-German nationalism in Russia and France, did\r\n     not avail herself of the splendid opportunity offered her to prove\r\n     her often-emphasized love of peace, otherwise the war between\r\n     Germany and France and England could have been averted.\r\n\r\n     When once the archives are opened the world will learn how often\r\n     Germany extended to England her friendly hand, but England did not\r\n     desire the friendship of Germany. Jealous of the development of\r\n     Germany, and feeling that by German efficiency and German industry\r\n     she has been surpassed in some fields, she had the desire to crush\r\n     Germany by brute force, as she in former times subdued Spain,\r\n     Holland, and France. She believed the moment had arrived, and\r\n     therefore the entry of German troops into Belgium gave her a\r\n     welcome pretext to take part in the war.\r\n\r\n     Germany, however, was forced to enter Belgium because she had to\r\n     forestall the planned French advance, and Belgium only awaited this\r\n     advance to join France. That only a pretext was involved as far as\r\n     England is concerned is proved by the fact that already on the\r\n     afternoon of Aug. 2, that is, prior to the violation of Belgium\r\n     neutrality by Germany, Sir Edward Grey assured the French\r\n     Ambassador unconditionally of the help of England in case the\r\n     German fleet attacked the French coast.\r\n\r\n     Moral scruple, however, the English policy does not know. And thus\r\n     the English people, who always posed as the protagonist of freedom\r\n     and right, has allied itself with Russia, the representative of the\r\n     most terrible barbarism, a country that knows no spiritual or no\r\n     religious freedom, that tramples upon the freedom of peoples as\r\n     well as of individuals. Already England is beginning to recognize\r\n     that she has made a mistake in her calculations, and that Germany\r\n     will master her enemies. She is therefore trying by the pettiest\r\n     means to injure Germany as much as possible in her commerce and\r\n     colonies, by instigating Japan, regardless of the consequences to\r\n     the cultural community of the white race, to a pillaging expedition\r\n     against Kiao-Chau, and leading the negroes in Africa to fight\r\n     against the Germans in the colonies.\r\n\r\n     Having strangled the news service of Germany to the whole world,\r\n     and having opened the campaign against us with a falsehood, England\r\n     will tell your countrymen that the German troops burned down\r\n     Belgian villages and cities, but will pass over in silence the fact\r\n     that Belgian girls gouged out the eyes of defenseless wounded.\r\n     Officials of Belgian cities have invited our officers to dinner and\r\n     shot and killed them across the table. Contrary to all\r\n     international law, the whole civilian population of Belgium was\r\n     called out, and after having at first shown friendliness, carried\r\n     on in the rear of our troops a terrible warfare with concealed\r\n     weapons.\r\n\r\n     Belgian women cut the throats of soldiers whom they had quartered\r\n     in their homes while they were sleeping. England also will say\r\n     nothing of the dumdum bullets which are being used by the English\r\n     and French despite all conventions and their hypocritical\r\n     proclamations of humanity, which can be seen here in their original\r\n     packing as they were found on French and English prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n     The Emperor has authorized me to say all this and to state that he\r\n     has full confidence in the sense of justice of the American people,\r\n     which will not allow itself to be deceived through the war of\r\n     falsehood which our enemies are conducting against us.\r\n\r\nThe statement of the Chancellor concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n     Every one who has lived in Germany since the outbreak of the war\r\n     has been able to witness the great moral uprising of all Germans\r\n     who, pressed hard on all sides, cheerfully take the field for the\r\n     defense of their rights and their existence; every one knows that\r\n     this people is not capable of any unnecessary cruelty or of any\r\n     brutality. We will win, thanks to the great moral strength which\r\n     our just cause gives to our troops, and in the end the greatest\r\n     falsehoods will be able to obscure our victories as little as they\r\n     do our rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY'S ARMAMENTS.\r\n\r\nSpeech Delivered in the Reichstag, March 30, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I have asked to speak in order to make a few brief remarks on the\r\n     question of disarmament and arbitration. The Social Democratic\r\n     motion proposes that I should take steps to bring about a general\r\n     limitation of armaments. As a matter of fact, the idea of\r\n     disarmament is being constantly discussed by pacifists in\r\n     Parliaments and in Congresses far and wide. Even the first peace\r\n     conference at The Hague had to confine itself to expressing the\r\n     wish that the Governments should devote themselves to the continued\r\n     study of the question.\r\n\r\n     Germany has responded to this desire, but has been able to find no\r\n     suitable formula, and I am not aware that other Governments have\r\n     been more successful. The time when wars were made by Cabinets is\r\n     past. The feelings which here in Europe may lead to war lie\r\n     elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     They have their roots in antagonisms which must be found in popular\r\n     sentiment. Everybody knows how easily this sentiment is influenced\r\n     and how, unfortunately, in many cases, it abandons itself\r\n     helplessly to irresponsible press agitations. A counterpoise to\r\n     all such and similar influences can but be desired. I shall be the\r\n     first to welcome it whenever international efforts succeed in\r\n     creating such a counterpoise.\r\n\r\n     But if I am to take practical steps and am to propose mutual\r\n     disarmament to the other powers, then general pacific assurances\r\n     and adjurations are not enough. With Germany there is no need for\r\n     such assurances or adjurations, in view of her constant policy\r\n     throughout forty years, which shows that we seek no quarrels in the\r\n     world. I should have to submit a fixed, definite programme. Then I\r\n     should have to consider in all sobriety whether such a programme\r\n     could be drawn up and carried out. Any one who makes uncertain and\r\n     vague proposals can easily become a disturber of the peace rather\r\n     than a peacemaker.\r\n\r\n     I shall have to decline to draw up such a formula and submit it to\r\n     an international congress.\r\n\r\nEngland's Naval Police.\r\n\r\n     England is convinced, and has repeatedly declared, in spite of her\r\n     desires for the limitation of expenditure on armaments and for the\r\n     adjustment of any disputes that may arise by arbitral procedure,\r\n     that her fleet must in all circumstances be superior, or at any\r\n     rate equal, to any possible combination in the world. England has a\r\n     perfect right to strive for such a state of things, and, precisely\r\n     because of the position that I take up toward the disarmament\r\n     question, I am the last to cast doubts upon it. It is quite another\r\n     thing, however, to make such a claim the basis of a convention\r\n     which must be recognized by all the other powers in peaceful\r\n     agreement. What if counterclaims are raised and the other powers\r\n     are not satisfied with the rôles assigned to them?\r\n\r\n     One only requires to propound these questions in order to see\r\n     things would not go well for European dignity at any world congress\r\n     which had to decide upon such claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n     And then armies. If, for example, Germany should be required to\r\n     reduce her army by 100,000 men, by how many men must the other\r\n     powers diminish their armies? Notwithstanding all the pacific\r\n     assurances which, thank God, are being given everywhere, every\r\n     nation would reply to me at any preliminary inquiry that it claims\r\n     that position in the world which corresponds with the sum of its\r\n     national power, that the strength of its defensive forces must be\r\n     adapted to this claim. At any rate, I would give no other reply for\r\n     Germany. I should be touching the honor and national sentiment of\r\n     any other people if I expected any other statement from it.\r\n\r\nQuestion of Control.\r\n\r\n     Every attempt at international disarmament must break down on the\r\n     question of control, which is absolutely impracticable. A classic\r\n     example of that is afforded by Prussia when overthrown by Napoleon.\r\n     Her army was to be limited to 45,000 men, but her patriotism,\r\n     notwithstanding the most ruthless application of every means of\r\n     control, managed to raise an army four times as large. The question\r\n     of disarmament is insoluble so long as men are men and States are\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     In the course of the debate reference has been made to the recent\r\n     utterances of the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in\r\n     the House of Commons on the disarmament question. The English\r\n     Minister gave expression to the idea that a reciprocal exchange of\r\n     information concerning the naval construction of both countries\r\n     would insure them against surprises, and that thereby both\r\n     countries would be convinced that they were not trying mutually to\r\n     outstrip each other, while other powers would thereby be kept\r\n     informed regarding the relations of Germany and England, and so the\r\n     exchange of announcements would, on the whole, serve to promote\r\n     peace.\r\n\r\n     We were all the more able to adhere to this idea as our naval\r\n     building programme has always lain open. We have already declared\r\n     our readiness to come to an understanding on this point with\r\n     England, in the hope that it may bring about a desired appeasement.\r\n\r\n\r\n     World-embracing international arbitration treaties dictated by an\r\n     international areopagus I consider just as impossible as general\r\n     international disarmament. Germany takes up no hostile position\r\n     toward arbitration. In all the new German treaties of commerce\r\n     there are arbitration clauses. In the main it was due to Germany's\r\n     initiative that an agreement was arrived at at the second Hague\r\n     conference for the establishment of an International Prize Court.\r\n\r\n     Arbitration treaties can certainly contribute in a great measure to\r\n     maintain and fortify peaceful relations. But strength must depend\r\n     on readiness for war. The dictum still holds good that the weak\r\n     becomes the prey of the strong. If a nation can not or will not\r\n     spend enough on her defensive forces for her to be able to make her\r\n     way in the world, then she falls back into the second rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary's Version of the War\r\n\r\nBy Kaiser Franz Josef and Count Berchtold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Rescript and Manifesto.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ischl, July 28.\r\n\r\n     Dear Count Stürgkh:\r\n\r\n     I have resolved to instruct the Ministers of my Household and\r\n     Foreign Affairs to notify the Royal Servian Government of the\r\n     beginning of a state of war between the Monarchy and Servia. In\r\n     this fateful hour I feel the need of turning to my beloved peoples.\r\n     I command you, therefore, to publish the inclosed manifesto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANIFESTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n     To my peoples! It was my fervent wish to consecrate the years\r\n     which, by the grace of God, still remain to me, to the works of\r\n     peace and to protect my peoples from the heavy sacrifices and\r\n     burdens of war. Providence, in its wisdom, has otherwise decreed.\r\n     The intrigues of a malevolent opponent compel me, in the defense of\r\n     the honor of my Monarchy, for the protection of its dignity and its\r\n     position as a power, for the security of its possessions, to grasp\r\n     the sword after long years of peace.\r\n\r\n     With a quickly forgetful ingratitude, the Kingdom of Servia, which,\r\n     from the first beginnings of its independence as a State until\r\n     quite recently, had been supported and assisted by my ancestors,\r\n     has for years trodden the path of open hostility to\r\n     Austria-Hungary. When, after three decades of fruitful work for\r\n     peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I extended my Sovereign rights to\r\n     those lands, my decree called forth in the Kingdom of Servia, whose\r\n     rights were in nowise injured, outbreaks of unrestrained passion\r\n     and the bitterest hate. My Government at that time employed the\r\n     handsome privileges of the stronger, and with extreme consideration\r\n     and leniency only requested Servia to reduce her army to a peace\r\n     footing and to promise that, for the future, she would tread the\r\n     path of peace and friendship. Guided by the same spirit of\r\n     moderation, my Government, when Servia, two years ago, was\r\n     embroiled in a struggle with the Turkish Empire, restricted its\r\n     action to the defense of the most serious and vital interests of\r\n     the Monarchy. It was to this attitude that Servia primarily owed\r\n     the attainment of the objects of that war.\r\n\r\n     The hope that the Servian Kingdom would appreciate the patience and\r\n     love of peace of my Government and would keep its word has not been\r\n     fulfilled. The flame of its hatred for myself and my house has\r\n     blazed always higher; the design to tear from us by force\r\n     inseparable portions of Austria-Hungary has been made manifest with\r\n     less and less disguise. A criminal propaganda has extended over the\r\n     frontier with the object of destroying the foundations of State\r\n     order in the southeastern part of the monarchy; of making\r\n     the people, to whom I, in my paternal affection, extended my full\r\n     confidence, waver in its loyalty to the ruling house and to the\r\n     Fatherland; of leading astray its growing youth and inciting it to\r\n     mischievous deeds of madness and high treason. A series of\r\n     murderous attacks, an organized, carefully prepared, and well\r\n     carried out conspiracy, whose fruitful success wounded me and my\r\n     loyal peoples to the heart, forms a visible bloody track of those\r\n     secret machinations which were operated and directed in Servia.\r\n\r\n     A halt must be called to these intolerable proceedings and an end\r\n     must be put to the incessant provocations of Servia. The honor and\r\n     dignity of my monarchy must be preserved unimpaired, and its\r\n     political, economic, and military development must be guarded from\r\n     these continual shocks. In vain did my Government make a last\r\n     attempt to accomplish this object by peaceful means and to induce\r\n     Servia, by means of a serious warning, to desist. Servia has\r\n     rejected the just and moderate demands of my Government and refused\r\n     to conform to those obligations the fulfillment of which forms the\r\n     natural and necessary foundation of peace in the life of peoples\r\n     and States. I must therefore proceed by force of arms to secure\r\n     those indispensable pledges which alone can insure tranquillity to\r\n     my States within and lasting peace without.\r\n\r\n     In this solemn hour I am fully conscious of the whole significance\r\n     of my resolve and my responsibility before the Almighty. I have\r\n     examined and weighed everything, and with a serene conscience I set\r\n     out on the path to which my duty points. I trust in my peoples,\r\n     who, throughout every storm, have always rallied in unity and\r\n     loyalty around my throne, and have always been prepared for the\r\n     severest sacrifices for the honor, the greatness, and the might of\r\n     the Fatherland. I trust in Austria-Hungary's brave and devoted\r\n     forces, and I trust in the Almighty to give the victory to my arms.\r\n\r\n     FRANZ JOSEF.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF WAR.\r\n\r\nPublished in Special Edition of Official Gazette, Vienna, July 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Royal Government of Servia not having given a satisfactory\r\n     reply to the note presented to it by the Austro-Hungarian Minister\r\n     in Belgrade on July 23, 1914, the Imperial and Royal Government of\r\n     Austria-Hungary finds it necessary itself to safeguard its rights\r\n     and interests and to have recourse for this purpose to force of\r\n     arms.

Austria-Hungary has given many proofs\r\n     in late years of her peaceful intention. She refrained from any\r\n     interference with arms in the Balkan war, though her interests were\r\n     at stake. Subsequent events have proved what a serious danger the\r\n     increase in territory and prestige which it brought Servia were for\r\n     Austria-Hungary. Servia's ambitions have since grown and have been\r\n     solely directed against the Dual Monarchy. Russia has tacitly\r\n     approved of Servia's action because Russian statesmen wish to form\r\n     an iron ring of enemies around Austria-Hungary and Germany in order\r\n     that Russia's grasp on Constantinople and on Asia should never\r\n     again be meddled with. Austro-Hungarian soldiers are fighting for\r\n     their homes and for the maintenance of their country, the Russians\r\n     are fighting to help the Russian Czar to gain the rule of the\r\n     world, to destroy all his neighbors who may be dangerous to Russian\r\n     ambitions. England is helping the Russians to oust her German\r\n     rival. She feared for some time that German culture and German\r\n     scientific methods would prove the stronger in a peaceful\r\n     competition, and she now hopes to crush Germany with the help of\r\n     Russia and France. And France is fighting to win back\r\n     Alsace-Lorraine, to take her revenge on Germany, which the French\r\n     nation has been aiming at for the last forty-four years.\r\n\r\n     That is how Austria-Hungary looks upon the war. She never wished\r\n     for territorial increase, she wished for peace and that her people\r\n     should develop in safety.\r\n\r\n     Germany equally had nothing to gain by a war, but Germany knows\r\n     that Austria-Hungary's enemies are her enemies and that the\r\n     dismemberment of the Hapsburg monarchy would mean the isolation of\r\n     the German Empire.\r\n\r\n     And so, after all efforts to keep Russia and England from breaking\r\n     the peace of Europe had failed, she drew her sword to defend her\r\n     and her allies' (ally's) interests.\r\n\r\n     Truth and honor are on the side of the two empires in this war, the\r\n     unspeakable inventions and prevarications published by the French,\r\n     Russian, and English press in the last weeks alone must prove to\r\n     the American people who can afford to tell the truth and nothing\r\n     but the truth in this war.\r\n\r\n     The Austro-Hungarian and German people have a clear conscience and\r\n     need fear no misrepresentation of their action.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISCORDANT NOTE.\r\n\r\nBy Count Michael Karolyi, Leader of Hungarian Independent Party, New\r\nYork, July 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n     If Austria had pursued a policy of directly helping the Balkan\r\n     countries, if Austria had in the past made it a point to be\r\n     actively their friend, this war would not confront us. Since it has\r\n     come, of course all Hungarians will support the empire and internal\r\n     differences will be dismissed while the empire is imperiled.\r\n\r\n     As for the loyalty of the many Serbs within Austria-Hungary it is\r\n     hard to say. There again we must hope that they will take the\r\n     Austrian side. But the Austrian policy toward the Balkan countries\r\n     has been wrong, all wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA German Review of the Evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCertified by Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, German Ex-Colonial\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The following is presented as a complete defense of the German position\r\nin the present war and is based upon examination of the German and\r\nEnglish \"White Papers.\" It was prepared in Germany and forwarded to Dr.\r\nBernhard Dernburg, who had it translated for_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _of\r\nNov. 1, 1914_.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dernburg gives this statement his full approval and accepts complete\r\nresponsibility for it._\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo of the five great European powers that are at present engaged in\r\nwar, Austria-Hungary and Russia, whose differences for years have been\r\nconstantly increasing in sharpness, and after the tragedy in Serajevo\r\nbecame impossible to be bridged by diplomacy, conjured up the frightful\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nWith these two, two other powers are so closely united by alliances that\r\ntheir participation in the war also was unavoidable; they are Germany\r\nand France.\r\n\r\nThere are two other great European powers whose relations to the two\r\naforesaid groups before the war were very much alike in the essential\r\npoints. Just as Italy was politically tied by alliance to the central\r\npowers, so England was with the Franco-Russian Alliance. Hence it was\r\nuncertain how these countries, each geographically removed from the main\r\nbody of the Continent, would act in a war, and it seemed quite possible\r\nthat both would decide to remain neutral.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Italian Government came to the view that such a\r\nstand would be for the best interests of its country.\r\n\r\nThis decision might have made it considerably more easy for England to\r\nalso maintain her neutrality, which, from political, economical, and\r\nethical reasons, would have been advantageous and natural for the Island\r\nEmpire. To the surprise and indignation of all those Germans who for\r\nyears had been working toward an adjustment of the conflicting interests\r\nof both countries--among these ought to be mentioned, above all, the\r\nKaiser and the Imperial Chancellor--the Liberal British Ministry\r\nimmediately declared war on Germany, and did not confine itself to a\r\nnaval war, but, in keeping with agreements reached years ago between the\r\nEnglish and the French General Staffs, as is now admitted, equipped an\r\nexpeditionary army, thus considerably strengthening the French forces.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, \"What reasons led British politics to this\r\nmonstrous step?\"\r\n\r\nMuch has been written during the last weeks from the German side,\r\ncriticising most sharply and with great justification the motive of the\r\nLondon Cabinet. In the following discussion we will confine ourselves to\r\nan impartial review of the documents published by the English Government\r\nitself in its own defense.\r\n\r\nThe essential part of this justification is contained in the\r\n\"Correspondence Concerning the European Crisis,\" placed before the\r\nBritish Parliament shortly after the start of the war, which is known as\r\nthe British \"White Paper.\" In amplification are to be considered the\r\n\"White Book\" placed by the German Government before the Reichstag and\r\nthe \"Orange Book\" published by Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATE COUNCILLOR SAZONOF\r\nRussian Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\n(_Photo (C) by American Press Assn._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN MOBILIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a public speech, delivered Sept. 19, the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nMr. Lloyd George, according to the report of The Westminster Gazette,\r\nwhich may be considered as his organ, characterized the quarrel between\r\nGermany and Russia in the picturesque manner which this statesman\r\nprefers, as follows:\r\n\r\n     GERMANY--I insist that you stand aside with crossed arms while\r\n     Austria strangles your little brother, (Servia.)\r\n\r\n     RUSSIA--Just you touch this little fellow and I will tear\r\n     your ramshackle empire limb from limb.\r\n\r\nWe will not waste words in considering the flippant form here used in a\r\ndiscussion of an unspeakably bloody and world-historic conflict. But\r\nthis expression in very pregnant form makes Russia appear in the light\r\nin which the London powers-that-be desire to show the empire of the Czar\r\nto the British people, viz., in the role of the noble-hearted protector\r\nof persecuted innocence, while Germany, supporting and egging on\r\nAustria-Hungary, is shown as morally responsible for the war.\r\n\r\nCites English Documents.\r\n\r\nThis, also, is the chain of thought in the speech of the British Prime\r\nMinister in the House of Commons on Aug. 4. Translations of this speech\r\nhave been spread by the British Government in neutral countries in\r\nhundreds of thousands of copies under the title: \"The Power Responsible\r\nfor War Is Germany.\"\r\n\r\nNow, we claim that the British \"White Paper\" itself furnishes\r\nirrefutable proof that not Germany, which up to the last moment offered\r\nthe hand of mediation, but Russia is responsible for the war, and that\r\nthe Foreign Office at London was fully cognizant of this fact.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the \"White Paper\" shows that England's claim that she\r\nentered this war solely as a protector of the small nations is a fable.\r\n\r\nThe documents reproduced in the \"White Paper\" do not begin until July\r\n20, and only a few introductory dispatches before the 24th are given.\r\nThe first of the very important reports of the British Ambassador at St.\r\nPetersburg, Sir George Buchanan, to the Secretary of State, Grey, is\r\ndated on that day; on the same day the note addressed by Austria-Hungary\r\nto the Servian Government had been brought to the knowledge of the\r\nEuropean Cabinets, and the British Ambassador conferred with the Russian\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, M. Sazonof, over this matter. The French\r\nMinister also took part in this conference. When the latter and M.\r\nSazonof, in the most insistent way, tried to prove to Buchanan that\r\nEngland, together with Russia and France, must assume a threatening\r\nattitude toward Austria-Hungary and Germany, the British Ambassador\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n     I said that I would telegraph a full report to you of what their\r\n     Excellencies had just said to me. I could not, of course, speak in\r\n     the name of his Majesty's Government, but personally I saw no\r\n     reason to expect any declaration of solidarity from his Majesty's\r\n     Government that would entail an unconditional engagement on their\r\n     part to support Russia and France by force of arms. Direct British\r\n     interests in Servia were nil, and a war on behalf of that country\r\n     would never be sanctioned by British public opinion.--(British\r\n     \"White Paper\" No. 6.)\r\n\r\nThe British Ambassador thereupon asked the question whether Russia was\r\nthinking of eventually declaring war on Austria. The following was the\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n     M. Sazonof said that he himself thought that Russian mobilization\r\n     would at any rate have to be carried out; but a council of\r\n     Ministers was being held this afternoon to consider the whole\r\n     question....\r\n\r\nThe dispatch continues:\r\n\r\n     French Ambassador and M. Sazonof both continue to press me for a\r\n     declaration of complete solidarity of his Majesty's Government with\r\n     French and Russian Governments.... (British \"White Paper\" No. 6.)\r\n\r\nThis shows plainly that the Russian mobilization must have been planned\r\neven before July 24, for otherwise M. Sazonof could not have spoken of\r\nthe necessity of carrying it through.\r\n\r\nIt is furthermore very remarkable that the Russian Minister on this\r\nearly day spoke of the mobilization in general and not of the partial\r\nmobilization against Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nFinally we find that the British Government was fully informed at the\r\nvery latest on July 24--it may have had before it previous documents,\r\nbut they are not contained in the \"White Paper\"--concerning Russian\r\nmobilization and thereby the development of Russian and French politics\r\nthat had to be anticipated.\r\n\r\nRussian Aggression.\r\n\r\nHad there been any doubts concerning these matters on the part of the\r\nBritish Government, the continual urging of Russian and French\r\ndiplomatists must have made things plain. Russia's aggressive\r\npolicy, and not the Austrian declaration of war on Servia, which did not\r\ncome until five days later, led to the European war. Servia meant so\r\nlittle to England, although England traditionally poses as a protector\r\nof small nations, that the British Ambassador in St. Petersburg was able\r\nto describe England's interest in the kingdom on the Save as \"nil.\" Only\r\nlater, after the beginning of the war, England warmed up to Servia, and\r\nin the aforementioned speech Mr. Lloyd George found the most hearty\r\ntones in speaking of the heroic fight of this \"little nation,\" although\r\nhe was obliged to admit simultaneously that its' history is not\r\nuntainted.\r\n\r\nOn the day following that conversation, on July 25, the British\r\nAmbassador had another talk with M. Sasonof, during the course of which\r\nhe felt obliged to express to the Russian Government a serious warning\r\nconcerning its mobilization.\r\n\r\n     On my expressing the earnest hope that Russia would not precipitate\r\n     war by mobilizing until you had had time to use your influence in\r\n     favor of peace his Excellency assured me that Russia had no\r\n     aggressive intentions and she would take no action until it was\r\n     forced on her. Austria's action was in reality directed against\r\n     Russia. She aimed at overthrowing the present status quo in the\r\n     Balkans and establishing her own hegemony there. He did not believe\r\n     that Germany really wanted war, but her attitude was decided by\r\n     ours. If we took our stand firmly with France and Russia there\r\n     would be no war. If we failed them now rivers of blood would flow\r\n     and we would in the end be dragged into war....\r\n\r\n     I said all I could to impress prudence on the Minister for Foreign\r\n     Affairs and warned him that if Russia mobilized Germany would not\r\n     be content with mere mobilization or give Russia time to carry out\r\n     hers, but would probably declare war at once! His Excellency\r\n     replied that Russia could not allow Austria to crush Servia and\r\n     become the predominant power in the Balkans, and, if she feels\r\n     secure of the support of France, she will face all the risks of\r\n     war. He assured me once more that he did not wish to precipitate a\r\n     conflict, but that unless Germany could restrain Austria I could\r\n     regard the situation as desperate.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 17.)\r\n\r\nA more convincing contradiction of the claim that Germany fell upon\r\nunexpectant Russia can hardly be imagined. Sazonof's conversation with\r\nthe British Ambassador shows that Russia had decided from the beginning\r\nto bring about the war, unless Austria would subject itself to Russia's\r\ndictation.\r\n\r\nNow, Russia was not alone concerned about Servia, but from its viewpoint\r\nAustria-Hungary must not maintain the preponderant position in the\r\nBalkans.\r\n\r\nSure of French help, Russia was determined to work against this. The\r\nreports of the British representative do not suggest with a word that\r\nGermany was responsible for the war; on the contrary, Sir Buchanan\r\nagain, on his own account, warned the Russian Government to keep aloof\r\nfrom military measures, in his conversation with M. Sazonof on July 27,\r\nalthough the \"White Paper\" does not show that he had received any\r\ninstructions by Sir Edward Grey.\r\n\r\n     His Excellency must not, if our efforts were to be successful, do\r\n     anything to precipitate a conflict. In these circumstances I\r\n     trusted that the Russian Government would defer the mobilization\r\n     ukase for as long as possible, and that troops would not be allowed\r\n     to cross the frontier even when it was issued.--(British \"White\r\n     Paper,\" No, 44.)\r\n\r\nJust as its own Ambassador in Petersburg pointed out to the British\r\nGovernment the dangers of Russian mobilization, England did not lack\r\nGerman warnings. On July 28 the British Ambassador in Berlin, Sir E.\r\nGoschen, reported as follows by wire concerning a conversation with the\r\nImperial Chancellor:\r\n\r\n     ... but if the news were true which he had just read in the papers,\r\n     that Russia had mobilized fourteen army corps in the South, he\r\n     thought the situation was very serious, and he himself would be in\r\n     a very difficult position, as in these circumstances it would be\r\n     out of his power to continue to preach moderation at Vienna. He\r\n     added that Austria, who as yet was only partially mobilizing, would\r\n     have to take similar measures, and if war were to result Russia\r\n     would be entirely responsible.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 71.)\r\n\r\nIn a telegram of Mr. Goschen's of July 30, reporting a conversation with\r\nthe Secretary of State, von Jagow, it is stated:\r\n\r\n     He begged me to impress on you difficulty of Germany's\r\n     position in view of Russian mobilization and military measures\r\n     which he hears are being taken in France.--(British \"White Paper\"\r\n     No. 98.)\r\n\r\nThe British Government has added a few further publications to its\r\n\"White Paper.\" Among these is a report of the hitherto British\r\nAmbassador in Vienna, Sir Maurice de Bunsen. The document is dated Sept.\r\n1; that is, a full month after the outbreak of the war. The tendency of\r\nthis publication is not only to unburden Russia and England from all\r\nblame and to put it upon German and Austro-Hungarian politics, but it\r\nattempts to make Germany responsible for the war to greater extent than\r\nAustria-Hungary in trying to sow dissension between the two allies.\r\n\r\nAmbassador de Bunsen represents matters as if Germany, through its\r\nultimatum to Russia on July 31, had roughly interrupted negotiations\r\npromising success then going on between Vienna and Petersburg. In this\r\nreport it is stated:\r\n\r\n     (Retranslated.) M. Schebeko [the Russian Ambassador at Vienna] on\r\n     July 28th attempted to induce the Austrian Government to authorize\r\n     Count Scapary to continue negotiations which he had been carrying\r\n     on with M. Sazonof and which appeared very promising. Count\r\n     Berchtold on this day declined, but two days later, July 30th,\r\n     although Russia then had already started partial mobilization\r\n     against Austria, he received M. Schebeko again in the most\r\n     courteous manner and gave his consent to continuation of the pour\r\n     parleurs.... On Aug. 1st M. Schebeko informed me that Austria was\r\n     ready to submit to mediation those parts of its note to Servia\r\n     which appeared to be irreconcilable to the independence of\r\n     Servia.... Unfortunately these pour parleurs in St. Petersburg and\r\n     Vienna were suddenly broken off by the quarrel being removed to the\r\n     more dangerous territory of a direct conflict between Germany and\r\n     Russia. Germany on July 31 stepped between the two with its double\r\n     ultimatum addressed to St. Petersburg and Paris.... A delay of a\r\n     few days in all probability would have spared Europe one of the\r\n     greatest wars in history.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, be it remembered that the fact that any negotiations\r\nbetween Austria and Russia were carried on up to the last hour was\r\nsolely the result of the uninterrupted German efforts to maintain\r\npeace, which fact Sir Maurice de Bunsen very wisely buries in silence.\r\nThese negotiations, by the way, hardly were as promising of success as\r\nis made to appear. The Austrian version of it is found in the Vienna\r\nFremdenblatt of Sept. 25, 1914. There the most important spots of\r\nBunsen's report, that Austria-Hungary had been ready to moderate several\r\npoints of its note to Servia, are mentioned, as follows:\r\n\r\n     As we are told by a well-informed source, these assertions do not\r\n     at all correspond to the facts; furthermore, from the very nature\r\n     of the steps undertaken by the dual monarchy in Belgrade, this\r\n     would have been entirely inconceivable.\r\n\r\nA glance at the date shows that the Bunsen report is misleading, for he\r\nhimself tells that Count Berchtold, on July 30, had expressed his\r\nconsent to a continuation of the exchange of thought in Petersburg; the\r\nlatter, therefore, could not begin before the 31st, while in the night\r\nfrom July 30 to 31 the mobilization of the entire Russian Army against\r\nGermany was ordered in Petersburg, finally making impossible the\r\ncontinuation of the last German attempt at mediation in Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, in spite of Russian and English twistings, that without\r\nthe interval caused by Germany's efforts in Vienna, which interval\r\nEngland allowed to pass unused in Petersburg, the war would have broken\r\nout a few days sooner.\r\n\r\nLet us consider how the fact of the Russian mobilization, the dimensions\r\nand tendency of which was brought to the knowledge of the London Cabinet\r\nat the very latest on July 24, must affect Germany.\r\n\r\nOn July 24 the Russian Government declared, in an official communiqué,\r\nit would be impossible for it to remain indifferent in an Austro-Servian\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nGermany's Hand Forced.\r\n\r\nThis declaration was followed immediately by military measures which\r\nrepresented the beginning of Russian mobilization long planned. But even\r\non July 27 the Russian Minister of War, Suchomlinof, assured\r\nthe German Military Attaché upon word of honor (Annex 11 of the German\r\n\"White Paper\") that no order for mobilization had been given and no\r\nreservists had been drawn and no horse had been commandeered.\r\n\r\nAlthough in this conversation there had been left no doubt to the\r\nRussian Minister of War concerning the fact that measures of\r\nmobilization against Austria must be considered by Germany also as very\r\nthreatening toward itself, during the next days news of the Russian\r\nmobilization arrived in quick succession.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th mobilization of Southern and Southwestern Russia was\r\nordered, which was extended on the 30th to twenty-three provinces.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 30th to the 31st, while the efforts of the Kaiser to\r\nmaintain peace were continuing and were receiving friendly attention in\r\nVienna, in St. Petersburg the mobilization of the entire Russian Army\r\nwas ordered. Even as late as 2 P.M. on the 31st, however, (German \"White\r\nPaper,\" Page 18, of NEW YORK TIMES reprint,) the Czar telegraphed the\r\nKaiser that the military measures now being taken were meant for\r\ndefensive purposes against Austria's preparations, and he gave his\r\npledge as far away from desiring war.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such evident duplicity of Russian politics, a further\r\ndelay such as was desired by Sir Maurice de Bunsen would have been for\r\nevery German statesman a crime against the security of his own country.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, upon what German measures did the Russian Government\r\nbase its order for mobilization? The British \"White Paper\" proves how\r\nfrivolously steps leading to the most serious results were ordered in\r\nSt. Petersburg. On July 30 Sir George Buchanan telegraphed:\r\n\r\n     M. Sazonof told us that absolute proof was in possession of the\r\n     Russian Government that Germany was making military and naval\r\n     preparations against Russia, more particularly in the direction of\r\n     the Gulf of Finland,--(British \"White Paper\" No. 97.)\r\n\r\nProofs Lacking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Buchanan's telegram of July 31 (British \"White\r\nPaper\" No. 113) states:\r\n\r\n     Russia has also reason to believe that Germany is making active\r\n     military preparations, and she cannot afford to let her get a\r\n     start.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 113.)\r\n\r\nSo, from one day to the next the \"absolute proof\" changed to a reason\r\nfor the assumption. In reality, both were assertions that lack all\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nThe finishing part of a telegram sent by the British Ambassador in\r\nBerlin to Sir Edward Grey on July 31 deserves special mention:\r\n\r\n     He [the German Secretary of State] again assured me that both the\r\n     Emperor William, at the request of the Emperor of Russia and the\r\n     German Foreign Office, had even up till last night been urging\r\n     Austria to show willingness to continue discussion--and telephonic\r\n     communications from Vienna had been of a promising nature--but\r\n     Russia's mobilization had spoiled everything.--(British \"White\r\n     Paper\" No. 121.)\r\n\r\nTherefore, the German Chancellor, in his memorandum placed before the\r\nReichstag, stated with full justification:\r\n\r\n     The Russian Government has smashed the laborious attempts at\r\n     mediation on the part of the European State Chancelleries, on the\r\n     eve of success, by the mobilization, endangering the safety of the\r\n     empire. The measures for a mobilization, about whose seriousness\r\n     the Russian Government was fully acquainted from the beginning, in\r\n     connection with their constant denial, show clearly that Russia\r\n     wanted war.\r\n\r\n     To this is to be added that the English Government also was made\r\n     fully cognizant of the intentions of the Russian mobilization, by a\r\n     witness that could not be suspected, namely, its own representative\r\n     in St. Petersburg, and therefore must bear full responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nGREY'S OMISSIONS AND ERRORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen from the \"Blue Book\" that the Secretary of State in London\r\nwas informed at the very latest on July 24 by his Ambassador in St.\r\nPetersburg of the plan of the Russian mobilization and consequently of\r\nthe tremendous seriousness of the European situation. Yet eight to nine\r\ndays had to elapse before the beginning of the war. Let us see whether\r\nSir Edward Grey used this time to preserve peace, according to his\r\nown documents.\r\n\r\nFrom this testimony it appears that even at the beginning of the last\r\nand decisive part of the European crisis, which began on June 28, 1914,\r\nwith the assassination of the Austrian heir to the throne, Sir Edward\r\nGrey refrained from considering a direct participation of his country in\r\nthe possible world war. At least, this must be the impression gained\r\nfrom his remarks to the representatives of the two powers with whom\r\nEngland is today at war. Thus, he said to the Austro-Hungarian\r\nAmbassador, Count Mensdorff, on July 23:\r\n\r\n     The possible consequences of the present situation were terrible.\r\n     If as many as four great powers of Europe--let us say Austria,\r\n     France, Russia, and Germany--were engaged in war, it seemed to me\r\n     that it must involve the expenditure of so vast a sum of money and\r\n     such an interference with trade that a war would be accompanied or\r\n     followed by a complete collapse of European credit and\r\n     industry.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 3.)\r\n\r\nHere Grey speaks only of four of the big powers at most that may go to\r\nwar, without even hinting at the fifth, namely, England. On July 24 he\r\nhad another conversation with the Austrian Ambassador, the theme of\r\nwhich was the note--meanwhile presented to Servia. It caused\r\napprehensions on his part, but he declared again:\r\n\r\n     The merits of the dispute between Austria and Servia were not the\r\n     concern of his Majesty's Government....\r\n\r\n     I [Grey] ended by saying that doubtless we should enter into an\r\n     exchange of views with other powers, and that I must await their\r\n     views as to what could be done to mitigate the difficulties of the\r\n     situation.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 5.)\r\n\r\nWe are already striking the fateful peculiarity of Grey's policy to\r\nhesitate where prompt action, or at least a clear and open conduct,\r\nwould have been his duty. This weakness of his nature has been used with\r\ngreat art by French and Russian diplomacy. This is illustrated by the\r\nconversation of July 24 between him and the French Ambassador, Cambon,\r\nin London:\r\n\r\n     M. Cambon said that, if there was a chance of mediation by the four\r\n     powers he had no doubt that his Government would be glad to join\r\n     in it; but he pointed out that we could not say anything in St.\r\n     Petersburg till Russia had expressed some opinion or taken some\r\n     action. But, when two days were over, Austria would march into\r\n     Servia, for the Servians could not possibly accept the Austrian\r\n     demand. Russia would be compelled by her public opinion to take\r\n     action as soon as Austria attacked Servia, and, therefore, once the\r\n     Austrians had attacked Servia it would be too late for any\r\n     mediation.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 10.)\r\n\r\nThus, England must not give any advice to Russia before it knows\r\nRussia's intent and even its measures. But inasmuch as Austria will have\r\nproceeded against Servia by that time Russia must make war, and the\r\nconclusion is that even on July 24 the catastrophe is considered\r\nunavoidable. Grey shows himself more and more hypnotized by the\r\nfatalistic view that it is too late. Hence he reports also on July 24 a\r\nconversation of the German Ambassador, Prince Lichnowsky:\r\n\r\n     I reminded the German Ambassador that some days ago he had\r\n     expressed a personal hope that if need arose I would endeavor to\r\n     exercise moderating influence at St. Petersburg, but now I said\r\n     that, in view of the extraordinarily stiff character of the\r\n     Austrian note, the shortness of time allowed, and the wide scope of\r\n     the demands upon Servia, I felt quite helpless as far as Russia was\r\n     concerned, and I did not believe any power could exercise influence\r\n     alone.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 11.)\r\n\r\nFrom a conversation of Grey with the Prince Lichnowsky, the German\r\nAmbassador, on July 25:\r\n\r\n     Alone we could do nothing. The French Government were traveling\r\n     [this refers to the visit at St. Petersburg by Messrs. Poincaré and\r\n     Viviani] at the moment, and I had had no time to consult them, and\r\n     could not, therefore, be sure of their views.--(British \"White\r\n     Paper\" No. 25.)\r\n\r\nIf Sir Edward Grey sincerely desired the maintenance of peace, he must\r\nhave had to use his entire influence at St. Petersburg to bring about\r\nthe stopping of the threatening military measures taken by Russia,\r\nwhereas he was waiting for the opinion of the French Government. He was\r\nbound to do this, so much the more in view of the fact that he demanded\r\nfrom Germany that it should exert its influence with Austria.\r\n\r\nThat this request of Grey's was complied with by Germany in so far as\r\nit was in any way in accord with the alliance with Austria-Hungary, and\r\nthat in Vienna every effort was made to conciliate matters, is shown by\r\nthe assurance of the Chancellor; he declares:\r\n\r\n     In spite of this [the Austro-Hungarian Government having remarked\r\n     with full appreciation of our action that it had come too late] we\r\n     continued our mediatory efforts to the utmost and advised Vienna to\r\n     make any possible compromise consistent with the dignity of the\r\n     monarchy.--(German \"White Paper,\" Page 17, of NEW YORK TIMES\r\n     reprint.)\r\n\r\nGrey well knew that Germany was doing all it could to mediate in Vienna.\r\nHe expressed his recognition and his joy over it on July 28 (\"Blue\r\nBook,\" Page 67):\r\n\r\n     It is very satisfactory to hear from the German Ambassador here\r\n     that the German Government have taken action at Vienna in the sense\r\n     of the conversation recorded in my telegram of yesterday to\r\n     you.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 67.)[02]\r\n\r\nNeither has Grey been left in the dark by the German side concerning the\r\ndifficulties, which by the Russian mobilization made every attempt to\r\nmediate in Vienna abortive. Even on July 31 the British Ambassador in\r\nBerlin telegraphed:\r\n\r\n     The Chancellor informs me that his efforts to preach peace and\r\n     moderation at Vienna have been seriously handicapped by the Russian\r\n     mobilization against Austria. He has done everything possible to\r\n     obtain his object at Vienna, perhaps even rather more than was\r\n     altogether palatable at the Ballplatz.--(British \"White Paper\" No.\r\n     108.)\r\n\r\nEngland and Russia.\r\n\r\nHow, on the other hand, about Grey's action with Russia? From the very\r\nbeginning one should have had a right to expect that, as Germany acted\r\nin Vienna, thus France, if it was active in Grey's spirit, would be\r\nworking in St. Petersburg for peace. Of this no trace whatsoever can be\r\nfound. The French Government thus far has not published any series of\r\ndocuments concerning its activity during the crisis, and neither in the\r\nRussian \"Orange Book\" nor in the English \"Blue Book\" is anything\r\nmentioned of the mediating activity on the part of France.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the latter power, wherever she puts in an\r\nappearance--as for instance in the conversation of the English\r\nAmbassador in St. Petersburg with his French colleague and M. Sazonof,\r\nas mentioned above--appears as fully identical with Russia.\r\n\r\nIt is also stated on July 24:\r\n\r\n     The French Ambassador gave me to understand that France would\r\n     fulfill all the obligations entailed by her alliance with Russia if\r\n     necessity arose, besides supporting Russia strongly in all\r\n     diplomatic negotiations.... It seems to me from the language held,\r\n     by French Ambassador that even if we decline to join them, France\r\n     and Russia are determined to make a strong stand.--(British \"White\r\n     Paper\" No. 6.)\r\n\r\nOne should think that Grey, who in view of this could not possibly\r\nexpect an influence for peace being brought to bear by France, but only\r\na strengthening of the Russian desire for aggression, now would have\r\nacted in the most energetic manner in St. Petersburg for the maintenance\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nIn reality, however, during the days that still remained, aside from a\r\nweak and in St. Petersburg absolutely ineffective advice to postpone\r\nmobilization, he did nothing whatsoever, and later placed himself in a\r\nmanner constantly more recognizable on the side of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe claim that the time limit given by the Austrian note to Servia was\r\nthe cause of the war, that Grey's mediation had only miscarried owing to\r\nthe haste of Germany, is disproved by the British documents\r\nthemselves. De Bunsen on July 26 telegraphed to Grey from Vienna:\r\n\r\n     Russian Ambassador just returned from leave, thinks that\r\n     Austro-Hungarian Government are determined on war and that it is\r\n     impossible for Russia to remain indifferent. He does not propose to\r\n     press for more time in the sense of your telegram of the 25th\r\n     inst.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 40.)\r\n\r\nTherefore Russia has paid little attention to the very shy and timid\r\nefforts to maintain peace by the London Secretary of State, even where\r\nthese were concerned in the attempt to change the position taken by\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nAnother proof: Sazonof on July 27 sent a telegram to the Russian\r\nAmbassador in London which the latter transmitted to Grey, and which\r\nconcerns itself with the much mentioned proposition of the latter to\r\nhave the conflict investigated by a conference of the four great powers\r\nnot immediately concerned.\r\n\r\nRussian Sincerity Questioned.\r\n\r\nThe conference plan was declined without much hesitation and openly by\r\nGermany, because it was compelled to see therein an attempt to place\r\nAustria before a European court of arbitration, and because it knew the\r\nserious determination of its ally in this matter. But did Russia really\r\nwant the conference? Minister Sazonof declares:\r\n\r\n     I replied to the [British] Ambassador that I have begun\r\n     conversations with the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, under\r\n     conditions which I hope may be favorable. I have not, however,\r\n     received as yet any reply to the proposal made by me for revising\r\n     the note between the two Cabinets.--(British \"White Paper\" No.\r\n     53.)\r\n\r\nHere it is shown plainly how little the conference plan was after the\r\nheart of the Russians. Had they accepted it it would have had to be done\r\nimmediately. As soon as the situation had grown very much more serious\r\nby the failure of the negotiations with Austria-Hungary there would have\r\nbeen no more time for this.[03]\r\n\r\nA telegram of the English Ambassador in St. Petersburg, dated July 27,\r\n(British \"White Paper\" No. 55,) shows how this conference was expected\r\nto be conducted in St. Petersburg:\r\n\r\n     His Excellency [Sazonof] said he was perfectly ready to stand aside\r\n     if the powers accepted the proposal for a conference, but he\r\n     trusted that you would keep in touch with the Russian Ambassador in\r\n     the event of its taking place.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 55.)\r\n\r\nRussian shrewdness evidently expected to control the conference by\r\nkeeping in touch with Grey, who of course would have been the Chairman.\r\nThe dispatches of his own Ambassadors lying before him should have\r\nenabled the Secretary of State to see the perfidy of the Russian policy.\r\nBuchanan wrote on the 28th from St. Petersburg:\r\n\r\n     ... and asked him whether he would be satisfied with the assurance\r\n     which the Austrian Ambassador had, I understood, been instructed to\r\n     give in respect to Servia's integrity and independence.... In reply\r\n     his Excellency stated that if Servia were attacked Russia would not\r\n     be satisfied with any engagement which Austria might take on these\r\n     two points....--(British \"White Paper\" No. 72.)\r\n\r\nEntirely in contrast herewith is one report of the British\r\nrepresentative in Vienna, dated Aug. 1, and speaking of a conversation\r\nwith the Russian Ambassador there:\r\n\r\n     Russia would, according to the Russian Ambassador, be satisfied\r\n     even now with assurance respecting Servian integrity and\r\n     independence. He said that Russia had no intention to attack\r\n     Austria.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 141.)\r\n\r\nWhat, then, may one ask, was the opinion which Sir Edward Grey had\r\nformed concerning Russia's real intentions? He learns from Russian\r\nsources and notes faithfully that Russia will accept Austrian guarantees\r\nfor independence of Servia, and also that it will not accept such\r\nguarantees. It is the same duplicity which Russia, when its own\r\nmobilization was concerned, showed toward Germany. Did Sir Edward not\r\nnotice this duplicity, or did he not wish to notice it? If the documents\r\nof the English Government have not been selected with the purpose to\r\nconfuse, then in London the decision to take part in the war does not\r\nseem to have been a certainty at the beginning. We have seen that\r\nAmbassador Buchanan in St. Petersburg on July 24 gave the Russian\r\nMinister to understand that England was not of a mind to go to war on\r\naccount of Servia. This position, taken by the Ambassador, was approved\r\nby Sir Edward Grey on the following day in the following words:\r\n\r\n     I entirely approve what you said ... and I cannot promise more on\r\n     behalf of the Government.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 24.)\r\n\r\nBased upon these instructions, Sir George Buchanan, even on July 27,\r\nstated to M. Sazonof, who continued to urge England to unconditionally\r\njoin Russia and France:\r\n\r\n     I added that you [Grey] could not promise to do anything more, and\r\n     that his Excellency was mistaken if he believed that the cause of\r\n     peace could be promoted by our telling the German Government that\r\n     they would have to deal with us as well as with Russia and France\r\n     if she supported Austria by force of arms. Their [the German]\r\n     attitude would merely be stiffened by such a menace.--(British\r\n     \"White Paper\" No. 44.)\r\n\r\nBut on this same 27th day of July, Grey, submitting to the intrigues of\r\nRussian and French diplomacy, had committed one very fateful step\r\n(Telegram to Buchanan, July 27):\r\n\r\n     I have been told by the Russian Ambassador that in German and\r\n     Austrian circles impression prevails that in any event we would\r\n     stand aside. His Excellency deplored the effect that such an\r\n     impression must produce. This impression ought, as I have pointed\r\n     out, to be dispelled by the orders we have given to the first fleet\r\n     which is concentrated, as it happens, at Portland not to disperse\r\n     for manoeuvre leave. But I explained to the Russian Ambassador that\r\n     my reference to it must not be taken to mean that anything more\r\n     than diplomatic action was promised.--(British \"White Paper\" No.\r\n     47.)\r\n\r\nFor Russia this order to the fleet meant very much more than a\r\ndiplomatic action. Sazonof saw that the wind in London was turning in\r\nhis favor and he made use of it. Among themselves the Russian\r\ndiplomatists seem to have for a long time been clear and open in their\r\ndiscussion of their real object. You find among the documents of the\r\nRussian \"Orange Book\" the following telegram of Sazonof of July 25 to\r\nthe Russian Ambassador in London:\r\n\r\n     In case of a new aggravation of the situation, possibly provoking\r\n     on the part of the great powers' united action, [des actions\r\n     conformes,] we count that England will not delay placing herself\r\n     clearly on the side of Russia and France, with the view to\r\n     maintaining the equilibrium of Europe, in favor of which she has\r\n     constantly intervened in the past, and which would without doubt be\r\n     compromised in the case of the triumph of Austria.--(Russian\r\n     \"Orange Paper\" No. 17.)\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of Servia here, but Austria should not triumph.\r\nRussia's real intention, of course, was not placed so nakedly before the\r\nBritish Secretary of State, hence to him the appearance was maintained\r\nthat the little State of the Sawe was the only consideration, although\r\nthe Russian Army was already being mobilized with all energy.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th he wires to the Russian Ambassador, Count Benckendorff, to\r\nLondon to inform the British Government:\r\n\r\n     It seems to me that England is in a better position than any other\r\n     power to make another attempt at Berlin to induce the German\r\n     Government to take the necessary action. There is no doubt\r\n     that the key of the situation is to be found at Berlin.--(British\r\n     \"White Paper\" No. 54.)\r\n\r\nThe opinion subtly suggested upon him by Paris and Petersburg diplomacy,\r\nnamely, that he should not use any pressure upon Russia, but upon\r\nGermany, now takes hold of Grey more and more. On July 29 he writes to\r\nthe German Ambassador as follows:\r\n\r\n     In fact, mediation was ready to come into operation by any method\r\n     that Germany thought possible if only Germany would \"press the\r\n     button in the interests of peace.\"--(British \"White Paper\" No. 84.)\r\n\r\nPetersburg, now assured of the support of Grey, becomes more and more\r\noutspoken for war. On the 28th Grey again expressed one of his\r\nsofthearted propositions for peace. Mr. Sazonof hardly made the effort\r\nto hide his contempt. Buchanan telegraphs on the 29th as follows:\r\n\r\n     The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that proposal referred to in\r\n     your telegram of the 28th inst. was one of secondary importance.\r\n     Under altered circumstances of situation he did not attach weight\r\n     to it.... Minister for Foreign Affairs had given me to understand\r\n     that Russia would not precipitate war by crossing frontier\r\n     immediately, and a week or more would in any case elapse before\r\n     mobilization was completed. In order to find an issue out of a\r\n     dangerous situation it was necessary that we should in the\r\n     meanwhile all work together.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 78.)\r\n\r\nNaivete or Cynicism?\r\n\r\nHere it really becomes impossible to judge where the naïveté of the\r\nBritish Secretary of State ends and cynicism begins, for Sazonof could\r\nnot have told to him more plainly than in these lines that all Russia's\r\nostensible readiness for peace served no other purpose than to win time\r\nto complete the strategical location of the Russian troops.\r\n\r\nThis point is emphasized by one document coming from a writer presumably\r\nunbiased, but presumably distrustful of Germany, wherein the\r\nconfirmation is found that England and Russia had come to a full\r\nagreement during these days.\r\n\r\nOn July 30 the Belgian Chargé d'Affaires de l'Escaille in Petersburg\r\nreported to the Belgian Government upon the European crisis. Owing to\r\nthe fast developing events of a warlike nature, this letter did not\r\nreach its address by mail, and it was published later on. The Belgian\r\ndiplomatist writes:\r\n\r\n     It is undeniable that Germany tried hard here [that is, in\r\n     Petersburg] and in Vienna to find any means whatsoever in order to\r\n     forestall a general conflict....\r\n\r\nAnd after M. de l'Escaille has told that Russia--what the Czar and his\r\nWar Minister with their highest assurances toward Germany had\r\ndenied--was mobilizing its own army, he continues:\r\n\r\n     Today at Petersburg one is absolutely convinced, yes, they have\r\n     even received assurances in that direction, that England and France\r\n     will stay by them. This assistance is of decisive importance and\r\n     has contributed much to the victory of the [Russian] war party.\r\n\r\nThis settles Grey's pretended \"attempts at mediation.\" The truth is that\r\nBritish politics decided to prevent a diplomatic success of Germany and\r\nAustria, now worked openly toward the Russian aim. \"The exertion of\r\npressure upon Berlin\" included already a certain threat, mingled with\r\ngood advice.\r\n\r\nOn July 23 Grey had only spoken of four possible powers in war; hence\r\nwhen on the German side some hope of England maintaining neutrality was\r\nindulged in, this impression rested upon Grey's own explanations. On\r\nJuly 29, however, after a political conversation with Prince Lichnowsky,\r\nGerman Ambassador in London, he adds an important personal bit of\r\ninformation. He wires concerning it to Berlin, to Goschen:\r\n\r\n     After speaking to the German Ambassador this afternoon about the\r\n     European situation, I said that I wished to say to him, in a quite\r\n     private and friendly way, something that was on my mind. The\r\n     situation was very grave.... But if we failed in our efforts to\r\n     keep the peace, and if the issue spread so that it involved every\r\n     European interest, I did not wish to be open to any reproach from\r\n     him, that the friendly tone of all our conversations had misled him\r\n     or his Government into supposing that we should not take action....\r\n     But we knew very well that if the issue did become such that we\r\n     thought that British interests required us to intervene, we must\r\n     intervene at once and the decision would have to be very\r\n     rapid.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 89.)\r\n\r\nBut what is especially wrong is that Grey brought this warning,\r\nwhich only could have any effect if it remained an absolute,\r\nconfidential secret between the English and German Governments, also to\r\nthe French Ambassador, so that the entire Entente could mischievously\r\nlook on and see whether Germany really would give in to British\r\npressure. Of course, in his manner of swaying to and fro, he did not\r\nwish either that Cambon should not accept this information to the German\r\nAmbassador as a decided taking of a position on the part of England:\r\n\r\n     I thought it necessary [speaking to M. Cambon] to say that because\r\n     as he knew we were taking all precautions with regard to our fleet\r\n     and I was about to warn Prince Lichnowsky not to count on our\r\n     standing aside, but it would not be fair that I should let M.\r\n     Cambon be misled into supposing that we had decided what to do in a\r\n     contingency that I still hoped might not arise....--(British \"White\r\n     Paper\" No. 87.)\r\n\r\nStirring Up Trouble.\r\n\r\nOn the German side Grey's open threat, which was presented, however,\r\nwith smooth and friendly sounding words, was received with quiet\r\npoliteness. Goschen telegraphed on the 30th concerning a talk with State\r\nSecretary von Jagow:\r\n\r\n     His Excellency added that telegram received from Prince Lichnowsky\r\n     last night contains matter which he had heard with regret, but not\r\n     exactly with surprise, and, at all events, he thoroughly\r\n     appreciated the frankness and loyalty with which you had\r\n     spoken.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 98.)\r\n\r\nNow the work of stirring up trouble is continued unceasingly. On July 30\r\nthe British Ambassador in Paris, Sir F. Bertie, concerning a\r\nconversation with the President of the Republic, reports:\r\n\r\n     He [Poincaré] is convinced that peace between the powers is in the\r\n     hands of Great Britain. If his Majesty's Government announced that\r\n     England would come to the aid of France in the event of a conflict\r\n     between France and Germany ... there would be no war, for Germany\r\n     would at once modify her attitude.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 99.)\r\n\r\nDid Grey really think for one moment that the German Empire would\r\nchange its position immediately, in other words, would suddenly leave\r\nits ally in need, or is all this only a mass of diplomatic\r\nblandishments?\r\n\r\nOn the same day Grey steps from the personal warning which he had given\r\nto the German Ambassador to the sharpest official threat. In a telegram\r\nto the Ambassador in Berlin upon the question placed before him by the\r\nChancellor of the empire on the day prior, (British \"White Paper\" No.\r\n85,) whether England would remain neutral if Germany would bind itself,\r\nafter possible war, to claim no French territory in Europe whatever,\r\nwhile in lieu of the French colonies a like guarantee could not be\r\naccepted, Grey answers with thundering words:\r\n\r\n     His Majesty's Government cannot for a moment entertain the\r\n     Chancellor's proposal that they should bind themselves to\r\n     neutrality on such terms. What he asks us in effect is to engage to\r\n     stand by while French colonies are taken and France is beaten, so\r\n     long as Germany does not take French territory as distinct from the\r\n     colonies. From a material point of view such a proposal is\r\n     unacceptable, for France without further territory in Europe being\r\n     taken from her could be so crushed as to lose her position as a\r\n     great power and become subordinate to German policy. Altogether\r\n     apart from that, it would be a disgrace for us to make this bargain\r\n     with Germany at the expense of France, a disgrace from which the\r\n     good name of this country could never recover.--(British \"White\r\n     Paper\" No. 101.)\r\n\r\nWith this telegram the war on Germany was practically declared, for as a\r\nprice of British neutrality an open humiliation of Germany was demanded.\r\nIf France--the question of French colonies is of very minor importance\r\nin this connection--must not be defeated by Germany, then England\r\nforbade the German Government to make war. It was furthermore stated\r\nthat Germany was absolutely compelled to accept Russian-French dictates,\r\nand would have to leave Austria to its own resources. This would have\r\nmeant Germany's retirement from the position of a great power, even if\r\nshe had backed down before such a challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly in the light of the developments concerning England's relation to\r\nFrance, given at the beginning of the war, Grey's policy, swaying\r\nbetween indecision and precipitate action, becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nIn all the explanations which the British Government in the course of\r\neight years had presented to the British Parliament concerning the\r\nrelations to other large powers, the assurance had been repeated that no\r\nbinding agreements with the two partners of the Franco-Russian alliance\r\nhad been made, above all, that no agreement with France existed. Only in\r\nhis speech in the House of Commons on Aug, 3, 1914, which meant the war\r\nwith Germany, Grey gave to the representatives of the people news of\r\ncertain agreements which made it a duty for Great Britain to work\r\ntogether with France in any European crisis.\r\n\r\nThe fateful document, which in the form of an apparently private letter\r\nto the French Ambassador, dealt with one of the most important compacts\r\nof modern history, was written toward the end of the year 1912, and is\r\npublished in the British \"White Paper\" No. 105, Annex 1:\r\n\r\n     London Foreign Office, Nov. 22, 1912.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Ambassador:\r\n\r\n     From time to time in recent years the French and British naval and\r\n     military experts have consulted together. It has always been\r\n     understood that such consultation does not restrict the freedom of\r\n     either Government to decide at any future time whether or not to\r\n     assist the other by armed force. We have agreed that consultation\r\n     between experts is not, and ought not to be, regarded as an\r\n     engagement that commits either Government to action in a\r\n     contingency that has not arisen and may never arise. The\r\n     disposition, for instance, of the French and British fleets\r\n     respectively at the present moment is not based upon an engagement\r\n     to co-operate in war.\r\n\r\n     You have, however, pointed out that, if either Government had grave\r\n     reason to expect an unprovoked attack by a third power, it might\r\n     become essential to know whether it could in that event depend upon\r\n     the armed assistance of the other.\r\n\r\n     I agree that, if either Government had grave reason to expect an\r\n     unprovoked attack by a third power, or something that threatened\r\n     the general peace, it should immediately discuss with the other\r\n     whether both Governments should act together to prevent aggression\r\n     and to preserve peace, and, if so, what measures they would be\r\n     prepared to take in common. If these measures involved action, the\r\n     plans of the General Staffs would at once be taken into\r\n     consideration, and the Governments would then decide what effect\r\n     should be given to them.\r\n\r\n     Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n     E. GREY.\r\n\r\nWas Parliament Deceived?\r\n\r\nA few members of the English Parliament who on Aug. 3 dared to gingerly\r\nprotest against the war may have had reason to complain about the hiding\r\nof facts from the House of Commons. When such understandings can be made\r\nwithout any one having an idea of their existence, then--so far as\r\nEngland is concerned--the supervision of the Government, theoretically\r\nbeing exercised by a Parliament, becomes a fiction.\r\n\r\nVeiled Defensive Alliance.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Grey does not desire to have accepted as political\r\nobligations the conversations of the French and English Army and Navy\r\nGeneral Staffs concerning the future plans of campaign which took place\r\nfrom time to time in times of peace. However, the true tendency of this\r\nagreement, for such it is, gives itself away in the promise to\r\nimmediately enter with France into a political and military exchange of\r\nopinions in every critical situation; it means in realty nothing less\r\nthan a veiled defensive alliance which by clever diplomatic\r\nmanipulations can be changed without any difficulty to an offensive one,\r\nfor inasmuch as the English Government promises to consult and work\r\ntogether with France, and consequently also with its ally, Russia, in\r\nevery crisis, before a serious investigation of the moments of danger,\r\nit waives all right of taking an independent position.\r\n\r\nHow would England ever have been able to enter a war against France\r\nwithout throwing upon itself the accusation of faithlessness against one\r\nwith whose plans for war it had become acquainted through negotiations\r\nlasting through years?\r\n\r\nHere a deviation may be permissible, which leaves for a moment the basis\r\nof documentary proof.\r\n\r\nIf one considers how this agreement of such immeasurable\r\nconsequences was not only hidden from the British Parliament by the\r\nCabinet, but how to the very edge of conscious deceit its existence was\r\ndenied--in the year 1913 Premier Asquith answered a query of a member of\r\nthe House of Commons that there were no unpublished agreements in\r\nexistence which in a case of war between European powers would interfere\r\nwith or limit free decision on the part of the British Government or\r\nParliament as to whether or not Britain should take part at a war--then\r\ncertain reports making their appearance with great persistency in June,\r\n1914, concerning an Anglo-Russian naval agreement are seen in a\r\ndifferent light.\r\n\r\nPersons who were acquainted with the happenings in diplomacy then stated\r\nthat the Russian Ambassador in Paris, M. Iswolski, during the visit\r\nwhich the King of England and Sir Edward Grey were paying to Paris, had\r\nsucceeded in winning the English statesmen for the plan of such an\r\nagreement. A formal alliance, it was said, was not being demanded by\r\nRussia immediately, for good reasons. M. Iswolski was attempting to go\r\nnearer to his goal, carefully, step by step.\r\n\r\nIt had been preliminarily agreed that negotiations should be started\r\nbetween the British Admiralty and the Russian Naval Attaché in London,\r\nCapt. Wolkow. As a matter of fact Wolkow during June went to St.\r\nPetersburg for a few days to, as was assumed, obtain instructions and\r\nthen return to London.\r\n\r\nGrey's \"Twisty\" Answer.\r\n\r\nThese happenings aroused so much attention in England that questions\r\nwere raised in Parliament concerning them. It was noted how twisty\r\nGrey's answer was. He referred to the answer of the Premier, already\r\nmentioned, stated that the situation is unchanged, and said then that no\r\nnegotiations were under way concerning a naval agreement with any\r\nforeign nation. \"As far as he was able to judge the matter,\" no such\r\nnegotiations would be entered into later on.\r\n\r\nThe big Liberal newspaper, The Manchester Guardian, was not at all\r\nsatisfied with this explanation; it assumed that certain conditional\r\npreliminary agreements might not be excluded.\r\n\r\nThis Russian plan, which was later worked out in St. Petersburg, went\r\ninto oblivion on account of the rapidly following European war. In the\r\nlight of the following revelation of Grey's agreement with France, the\r\nnews of the naval agreement desired by Iswolski assumed another aspect.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the Anglo-French agreement. The following remarks by\r\nthe French Ambassador in London, reported by Grey, prove that, on the\r\nground of this agreement, France, with very little trouble, would be\r\nable to make out of a diplomatic entanglement a case for Allies'\r\ninterest as far as England is concerned.\r\n\r\nA German \"Attack.\"\r\n\r\nHe [Cambon] anticipated that the [German] aggression would take the form\r\nof either a demand to cease her preparations or a demand that she should\r\nengage to remain neutral if there was war between Germany and Russia.\r\nNeither of these things would France admit.--(British \"White Paper\" No.\r\n105.)\r\n\r\nTherefore, even the demand addressed to France not to, jointly with\r\nRussia, attack Germany became a German \"attack,\" which obliged England\r\nto come to the aid!\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, even on July 27 in a conversation with Cambon, Grey\r\ngave himself the appearance as if his hands were free. He told the\r\nFrenchman:\r\n\r\n     If Germany became involved and France became involved we had not\r\n     made up our minds what we should do; it was a case that we should\r\n     have to consider.... We were free from engagements and we should\r\n     have to decide what British interests required us to do.--(British\r\n     \"White Paper\" No. 87.)\r\n\r\nM. Cambon remarked in reply that the Secretary of State had clearly\r\npictured the situation, but on the very following day the French\r\nAmbassador took the liberty to remind Grey of the letter written in\r\n1912. (British \"White Paper\" No. 105.)\r\n\r\nGrey did not deny the claim implied in this reminder, but even as late\r\nas July 31 he reports as follows concerning the conversation with\r\nCambon:\r\n\r\n     Up to the present moment we did not feel and public opinion\r\n     did not feel that any treaties or obligations of this country were\r\n     involved.... M. Cambon repeated his question whether we would help\r\n     France if Germany made an attack on her. I said I could only adhere\r\n     to the answer that, as far as things had gone at present, we could\r\n     not take any engagement.... I said that the Cabinet would certainly\r\n     be summoned as soon as there was some new development; that at the\r\n     present moment the only answer I could give was that we could not\r\n     undertake any definite engagement.--(British \"White Paper\" No.\r\n     119.)\r\n\r\nNow, if we remember that even on the day before Grey had informed the\r\nGerman Imperial Chancellor that it would be a shame for England to\r\nremain neutral and allow France to be crushed, we here find a new proof\r\nof the unreliability of his conduct. If he has been gullible, the\r\ndeclaration of 1912, the dangerous character of which is increased by\r\nits apparently undefined tenor, has enmeshed him more and more. Also the\r\nmilitary and naval circles, whose consultations with the representatives\r\nof the French Army and Navy certainly have been continued diligently\r\nsince the beginning of the Servian crisis, were forcing toward a\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nAt all events, it became more impossible with every hour for Germany to\r\nkeep England out of the way by any offers whatsoever. This is proved by\r\nGrey's conversation of Aug. 1 with the German Ambassador:\r\n\r\n     He asked me whether if Germany gave a promise not to violate\r\n     Belgian neutrality we would engage to remain neutral. I replied\r\n     that I could not say that; our hands were still free, and we were\r\n     considering what our attitude should be.... The Ambassador pressed\r\n     me as to whether I could not formulate conditions on which we would\r\n     remain neutral. I said that I felt obliged to refuse definitely any\r\n     promise.... (British \"White Paper\" No. 123.)\r\n\r\nBelgium Not the Cause.\r\n\r\nHence, only if Germany would permit herself to be humiliated war with\r\nEngland could be avoided. The violation of Belgium's neutrality was in\r\nno way the cause of England joining Germany's enemies, for while German\r\ntroops did not enter Belgium until the night from Aug. 3 to 4, Grey gave\r\non Aug. 2 the following memorandum to the French Ambassador after a\r\nsession of the Cabinet in London:\r\n\r\n     I am authorized to give an assurance that if the German fleet comes\r\n     into the Channel or through the North Sea to undertake hostile\r\n     operations against French coasts or shipping, the British fleet\r\n     will give all the protection in its power.--(British \"White Paper\"\r\n     No. 148.)\r\n\r\nAs the aim of this decision, of which M. Cambon was informed verbally,\r\nwas to give France an assurance that it would be placed in a position\r\n\"to settle the disposition of its own Mediterranean fleet,\" Grey would\r\nnot accept the version of Cambon that England would take part in a war\r\nwith Germany. This is a case of splitting hairs in order to put the\r\nblame of starting the war on Germany, for while England promised to\r\nprotect the French coast and to make it possible for the French fleet to\r\nstay in the Mediterranean, she almost immediately proceeded to a warlike\r\naction against Germany, especially as the English Minister\r\nsimultaneously refused to bind himself to maintain even this peculiar\r\nneutrality.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nBELGIAN NEUTRALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe highest representatives of the German Empire with emphatic\r\nseriousness declared that it was with a heavy heart and only following\r\nthe law of self-preservation that they decided to violate the neutrality\r\nof the Kingdom of Belgium, guaranteed by the great powers in the\r\ntreaties of 1831 and 1839.\r\n\r\nThe German Secretary of State on Aug. 4 informed the English Government\r\nthrough the embassy in London that Germany intended to retain no Belgian\r\nterritory, and added:\r\n\r\n     Please impress upon Sir E. Grey that German Army could not be\r\n     exposed to French attack across Belgium, which was planned,\r\n     according to absolutely unimpeachable information. Germany had\r\n     consequently to disregard Belgian neutrality, it being with her a\r\n     question of life or death to prevent French advance.--(British\r\n     \"White Paper\" No. 157.)\r\n\r\nIn answer Grey caused the English Ambassador in Berlin to demand his\r\npassports and to tell the German Government that England would\r\ntake all steps for defense of Belgian neutrality. This, therefore,\r\nrepresents, in the view which very cleverly has been spread broadcast by\r\nBritish publicity, the real reason for the war. But in spite of the\r\nmoral indignation that is apparent against Germany, the consideration\r\nfor Belgium, up until very late, does not seem in any way to have been\r\nin the foreground. We find on July 31 Grey stated to Cambon:\r\n\r\n     The preservation of the neutrality of Belgium might be, I would not\r\n     say a decisive, but an important, factor in determining our\r\n     attitude.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 119.)\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, there was no talk about England grasping the sword on\r\naccount of Belgium. Now no one will claim that the assumption that the\r\nGerman troops could march through Belgium would be new or unheard of.\r\nFor years this possibility had been discussed in military\r\nliterature.[04]\r\n\r\nThis expression on the part of the historical Faculty is very\r\ninteresting. It shows that a plan of campaign between the English and\r\nFrench had long been considered, and that the Belgian entry into the\r\nalliance against Germany was a matter agreed upon.\r\n\r\nA Sudden Decision.\r\n\r\nIt must also be assumed that the Belgian Government knew toward the end\r\nof July at the latest that the war between Germany and France was\r\nprobable and the march of Germans through Belgium very possible.\r\n\r\nIf England had not taken part in the war against Germany, it may be\r\nassumed that it would have given Belgium the advice to permit the\r\nmarching through of the German Army, somewhat in the same manner as the\r\nGrand Duchy of Luxemburg did, with a protest. In doing so the Belgian\r\npeople would have been spared a great deal of misery and loss of blood.\r\nOn Aug. 3 the Belgian Government replied to an offer of military help by\r\nFrance as follows:\r\n\r\n     We are sincerely grateful to the French Government for offering\r\n     eventual support. In the actual circumstances, however, we do not\r\n     propose to appeal to the guarantee of the powers. Belgian\r\n     Government will decide later on the action which they may think\r\n     necessary to take.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 151.)\r\n\r\nOne day later London decided to make Belgian neutrality the cause of the\r\nwar against Germany before the eyes of the world. The Ambassador in\r\nBrussels received the following orders:\r\n\r\n     You should inform Belgian Government that if pressure is applied to\r\n     them by Germany to induce them to depart from neutrality, his\r\n     Majesty's Government expects that they will resist by any means in\r\n     their power and that his Majesty's Government will support them in\r\n     offering such resistance, and that his Majesty's Government in this\r\n     event are prepared to join Russia and France.--(British \"White\r\n     Paper\" No. 155.)\r\n\r\nNot until England thus stirred Belgium up, holding out the deceptive\r\nhope of effective French and English help, did Belgian fanaticism break\r\nloose against Germany. Without the intervention of England in Brussels\r\nthe events in Belgium, one may safely assert, would have taken an\r\nentirely different course, which would have been far more favorable to\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, England had thus found a very useful reason for war\r\nagainst Germany. Even on the 31st of July Grey had spoken of the\r\nviolation of Belgian neutrality as not a decisive factor. On Aug. 1 he\r\ndeclined to promise Prince Lichnowsky England's neutrality, even if\r\nGermany would not violate Belgium's neutrality. On Aug. 4, however, the\r\nBelgian question was the cause that suddenly drove England to maintain\r\nthe moral fabric of the world and to draw the sword.\r\n\r\nThis suddenly became the new development, which was still\r\nlacking for Grey in order to justify this war before public opinion in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAnother English Advantage.\r\n\r\nAnd something else was secured by the drawing of Belgium into the war by\r\nthe British Government, which had decided to make war on Germany for\r\nentirely different reasons: the thankful part of the protector of the\r\nweak and the oppressed.\r\n\r\nAs an English diplomat, when Russia was mobilizing, openly stated, the\r\ninterests of his country in Servia were nil, so for Grey even Belgium,\r\nimmediately before the break with Germany, was not decisive. However,\r\nwhen England had irrevocably decided to enter the war it stepped out\r\nbefore the limelight of the world as the champion of--the small nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[02] Recently a book entitled \"Why We Make War,\" in defense of Great\r\nBritain, appeared at Oxford, as the authors of which \"Members of the\r\nFaculty for Modern History in Oxford\" are mentioned. This work\r\nundertakes, on the ground of the official publications, to whitewash\r\nGrey's policy, and of course incidentally the Russian policy. All\r\ntogether this publication, parading in the gown of science, is\r\ncontradicted by our own presentation of the facts; it may be mentioned\r\nalso that this work contains in part positive untruths. Thus it states\r\non Page 70 (retranslation):\r\n\r\n     No diplomatic pressure whatever was exerted [by Germany] on Vienna,\r\n     which, under the protection of Berlin, was permitted to do with\r\n     Servia as she liked.\r\n\r\n     Grey's own words contradict this assertion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[03] In the aforementioned book of the Oxford historians there is\r\nstated on Page 69 (retranslation):\r\n\r\n     This mediation [namely, Grey's mediation proposition] had already\r\n     been accepted, by Russia on July 25th.\r\n\r\nWe have shown in the foregoing that the Russian Government did in no\r\nmanner subscribe to the conference plan in binding terms. As an\r\nadditional proof, a part of Buchanan's dispatch of the 25th may be\r\nmentioned:\r\n\r\n     He [Sazonof] would like to see the question placed on international\r\n     footing.... If Servia should appeal to the powers, Russia would be\r\n     quite ready to stand aside and leave the question in the hands of\r\n     England, France, Germany, and Italy. It would be possible in his\r\n     opinion that Servia might propose to submit the question to\r\n     arbitration.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 17.)\r\n\r\nHence, not if England, but only if Servia would propose arbitration by\r\nthe powers, Mr. Sazonof was willing! The most amusing part of this is\r\nthat the Russian Minister himself considers such a proposition on the\r\npart of Servia merely as \"possible\"; evidently it would have appeared as\r\na great condescension on the part of the Government at Belgrade if it,\r\nstanding on the same basis as Austria-Hungary, would appear before a\r\nEuropean tribunal! For us there is no additional proof necessary that a\r\nmediation conference, which for Austria was not acceptable even when\r\nproposed by England, would be unthinkable if the move for such came from\r\nServia. In expressing such an idea. Mr. Sazonof proved that it was his\r\nintention to bring war about.\r\n\r\n\r\n[04] The book, which appeared at Oxford, \"Why We Are at War,\" mentioned\r\npreviously states on Page 27 (retranslation):\r\n\r\n     That such a plan [the marching through Luxemburg and Belgium] had\r\n     been taken into consideration by the Germans has been known in\r\n     England generally for several years; and it has also been generally\r\n     accepted that the attempt to carry out this plan would bring about\r\n     the active resistance of the British armed forces: one assumed that\r\n     these would be given the task of assisting the left wing of the\r\n     French, which would have to resist German advance from Belgian\r\n     territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Truth About Germany\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAttested by Thirty-four German Dignitaries.[05]\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard of Editors.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Paul Dehn, Schriftsteller, Berlin.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Drechsler, Direktor des Amerika-Instituts, Berlin.\r\n\r\n     Matthias Erzberger, Mitglied des Reichstags, Berlin.\r\n\r\n     Prof. Dr. Francke, Berlin.\r\n\r\n     B.

Only a few\r\nweeks ago all of us were peacefully following our several vocations. The\r\npeasant was gathering in this Summer's plentiful crop, the factory hand\r\nwas working with accustomed vigor. Not one human being among us dreamed\r\nof war. We are a nation that wishes to lead a quiet and industrious\r\nlife. This need hardly be stated to you Americans. You, of all others,\r\nknow the temper of the German who lives within your gates. Our love of\r\npeace is so strong that it is not regarded by us in the light of a\r\nvirtue, we simply know it to be an inborn and integral portion of\r\nourselves. Since the foundation of the German Empire in the year 1871,\r\nwe, living in the centre of Europe, have given an example of\r\ntranquillity and peace, never once seeking to profit by any momentary\r\ndifficulties of our neighbors. Our commercial extension, our financial\r\nrise in the world, is far removed from any love of adventure, it is the\r\nfruit of painstaking and plodding labor.\r\n\r\nWe are not credited with this temper, because we are insufficiently\r\nknown. Our situation and our way of thinking are not easily grasped.\r\n\r\nEvery one is aware that we have produced great philosophers and poets,\r\nwe have preached the gospel of humanity with impassioned zeal. America\r\nfully appreciates Goethe and Kant, looks upon them as cornerstones of\r\nelevated culture. Do you really believe that we have changed our\r\nnatures, that our souls can be satisfied with military drill and servile\r\nobedience? We are soldiers because we have to be soldiers, because\r\notherwise Germany and German civilization would be swept away from the\r\nface of the earth. It has cost us long and weary struggles to attain our\r\nindependence, and we know full well that, in order to preserve it, we\r\nmust not content ourselves with building schools and factories, we must\r\nlook to our garrisons and forts. We and all our soldiers have remained,\r\nhowever, the same lovers of music and lovers of exalted thought. We have\r\nretained our old devotion to all peaceable sciences and arts; as all the\r\nworld knows, we work in the foremost rank of all those who strive to\r\nadvance the exchange of commodities, who further useful technical\r\nknowledge. But we have been forced to become a nation of soldiers in\r\norder to be free. And we are bound to follow our Kaiser, because he\r\nsymbolizes and represents the unity of our nation. Today, knowing no\r\ndistinction of party, no difference of opinion, we rally around him,\r\nwilling to shed the last drop of our blood. For though it takes a great\r\ndeal to rouse us Germans, when once aroused our feelings run deep and\r\nstrong. Every one is filled with this passion, with the soldier's ardor.\r\nBut when the waters of the deluge shall have subsided, gladly will we\r\nreturn to the plow and to the anvil.\r\n\r\nIt deeply distresses us to see two highly civilized nations, England and\r\nFrance, joining the onslaught of autocratic Russia. That this could\r\nhappen will remain one of the anomalies of history. It is not our fault;\r\nwe firmly believed in the desirability of the great nations working\r\ntogether, we peaceably came to terms with France and England in sundry\r\ndifficult African questions. There was no cause for war between Western\r\nEurope and us, no reason why Western Europe should feel itself\r\nconstrained to further the power of the Czar.\r\n\r\nThe Czar, as an individual, is most certainly not the instigator of the\r\nunspeakable horrors that are now inundating Europe. But he bears before\r\nGod and posterity the responsibility of having allowed himself to be\r\nterrorized by an unscrupulous military clique.\r\n\r\nEver since the weight of the crown has pressed upon him, he has been the\r\ntool of others. He did not desire the brutalities in Finland, he did not\r\napprove of the iniquities of the Jewish pogroms, but his hand was too\r\nweak to stop the fury of the reactionary party. Why would he not permit\r\nAustria to pacify her southern frontier? It was inconceivable that\r\nAustria should calmly see her heir apparent murdered. How could she? All\r\nthe nationalities under her rule realized the impossibility of tamely\r\nallowing Servia's only too evident and successful intrigues to be\r\ncarried on under her very eyes. The Austrians could not allow their\r\nvenerable and sorely stricken monarch to be wounded and insulted any\r\nlonger. This reasonable and honorable sentiment on the part of Austria\r\nhas caused Russia to put itself forward as the patron of Servia, as the\r\nenemy of European thought and civilization.\r\n\r\nRussia has an important mission to fulfill in its own country and in\r\nAsia. It would do better in its own interest to leave the rest of the\r\nworld in peace. But the die is cast, and all nations must decide whether\r\nthey wish to further us by sentiments and by deeds, or the government of\r\nthe Czar. This is the real significance of this appalling struggle, all\r\nthe rest is immaterial. Russia's attitude alone has forced us to go to\r\nwar with France and with their great ally.\r\n\r\nThe German Nation is serious and conscientious. Never would a German\r\nGovernment dare to contemplate a war for the sake of dynastic interest,\r\nor for the sake of glory. This would be against the entire bent of our\r\ncharacter. Firmly believing in the justice of our cause, all parties,\r\nthe Conservatives and the Clericals, the Liberals and the Socialists,\r\nhave joined hands. All disputes are forgotten, one duty exists for all,\r\nthe duty of defending our country and vanquishing the enemy.\r\n\r\nWill not this calm, self-reliant and unanimous readiness to sacrifice\r\nall, to die or to win, appeal to other nations and force them to\r\nunderstand our real character and the situation in which we are placed?\r\n\r\nThe war has severed us from the rest of the world, all our cable\r\ncommunications are destroyed. But the winds will carry the mighty voice\r\nof justice even across the ocean. We trust in God, we have confidence in\r\nthe judgment of right-minded men. And through the roar of battle, we\r\ncall to you all. Do not believe the mischievous lies that our enemies\r\nare spreading about! We do not know if victory will be ours, the Lord\r\nalone knows. We have not chosen our path, we must continue doing our\r\nduty, even to the very end. We bear the misery of war, the death of our\r\nsons, believing in Germany, believing in duty.\r\n\r\nAnd we know that Germany cannot be wiped from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[05]\r\n\r\n     \"Athenwood,\" Newport, R.I.,\r\n\r\n     Sept. 17, 1914.\r\n\r\n     Today I have received from Germany a pamphlet entitled \"Truth About\r\n     Germany, Facts About the War.\" The correctness and completeness of\r\n     its statements are vouched for by thirty-four persons, whose names\r\n     are recorded therein as members of an Honorary Committee. I know\r\n     personally seventeen of these thirty-four persons, and have known\r\n     them for years, some of them intimately. With six of them I have\r\n     labored as a colleague in university work. I have been introduced\r\n     into their homes, have broken bread at their tables and have\r\n     conversed with them long and often upon the problems of life and\r\n     culture. They are among the greatest thinkers, moralists and\r\n     philanthropists of the age. They are the salt of the earth! The\r\n     great theologian Harnack, the sound and accomplished political\r\n     scientist and economist von Schmoller, the distinguished\r\n     philologian von Wilamowitz, the well-known historian Lamprecht, the\r\n     profound statesman von Posadowsky, the brilliant diplomatist von\r\n     Bülow, the great financier von Gwinner, the great promoter of trade\r\n     and commerce Ballin, the great inventor Siemens, the brilliant\r\n     preacher of the Gospel Dryander, the indispensable Director in the\r\n     Ministry of Education Schmidt. Two of them are, in a sense, our own\r\n     countrywomen, the Baroness Speck von Sternburg and Frau\r\n     Staats-minister von Trott zu Solz.

Copies of this pamphlet\r\n     are being given to all Americans returning home from Germany. One\r\n     chapter, headed \"Neutrality by Grace of England,\" scoffs at the\r\n     idea of England today being the defender of neutral States and\r\n     declares that it was England who in 1911 was ready to land 160,000\r\n     men at Antwerp to help the French against the Germans.\r\n\r\n     As to who will ultimately win in the war, the pamphlet asks whether\r\n     it will be the striving nation, the young strength, or the old\r\n     peoples, France and England, with their flagging civilization in\r\n     alliance with Muscovite retrogression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE WAR CAME ABOUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is responsible for the war?--Not Germany! England's policy! Her\r\nshifting of responsibility and promoting the struggle while alone\r\npossessing power to avert it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an old and common experience that after the outbreak of a war the\r\nvery parties and persons that wanted the war, either at once or later,\r\nassert that the enemy wanted and began it. The German Empire especially\r\nalways had to suffer from such untruthful assertions, and the very first\r\ndays of the present terrible European war confirm again this old\r\nexperience. Again Russian, French, and British accounts represent the\r\nGerman Empire as having wanted the war.\r\n\r\nOnly a few months ago influential men and newspapers of Great Britain as\r\nwell as of Paris could be heard to express the opinion that nobody in\r\nEurope wanted war and that especially the German Emperor and his\r\nGovernment had sincerely and effectively been working for peace.\r\nEspecially the English Government, in the course of the last two years,\r\nasserted frequently and publicly, and was supported by The Westminster\r\nGazette and a number of influential English newspapers in the assertion,\r\nthat Great Britain and the German Empire during the Balkan crisis of the\r\nlast few years had always met on the same platform for the preservation\r\nof peace. The late Secretary of State, von Kiderlen-Waechter, his\r\nsuccessor, Mr. von Jagow, and the Imperial Chancellor, von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg, likewise declared repeatedly in the Reichstag, how\r\ngreat their satisfaction was that a close and confidential diplomatic\r\nco-operation with Great Britain, especially in questions concerning the\r\nNear East, had become a fact. And it has to be acknowledged today that\r\nat that time the German and British interests in the Near East were\r\nidentical or at any rate ran in parallel lines.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of European Turkey in the war against the Balkan Alliance\r\ncreated an entirely new situation. At first Bulgaria was victorious and\r\ngreat, then it was beaten and humiliated by the others with the\r\nintellectual help of Russia. There could be no doubt about Russia's\r\nintentions: she was preparing for the total subjection of weakened\r\nTurkey and for taking possession of the Dardanelles and Constantinople\r\nin order to rule from this powerful position Turkey and the other Balkan\r\nStates. Great Britain and the German Empire, which only had economic\r\ninterests in Turkey, were bound to wish to strengthen Turkey besides\r\ntrying to prevent the Muscovite rule on the whole Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\nServia had come out of the second Balkan war greatly strengthened and\r\nwith her territory very much increased. Russia had done everything to\r\nstrengthen this bitter enemy of our ally, Austria-Hungary. For a great\r\nnumber of years Servian politicians and conspirators had planned to\r\nundermine the southeastern provinces of Austria-Hungary and to separate\r\nthem from the Dual Monarchy. In Servia as well as in Russia prevailed\r\nthe opinion that, at the first attack, Austria-Hungary would fall to\r\npieces. In this case Servia was to receive South Austria and Russia was\r\nto dictate the peace in Vienna. The Balkan war had ruined Turkey almost\r\nentirely, had paralyzed Bulgaria, that was friendly, and had\r\nstrengthened the Balkan States that were hostile to Austria. At the same\r\ntime there began in Rumania a Russian and French propaganda, that\r\npromised this country, if it should join the dual alliance, the\r\nHungarian Province of Siebenbuergen.\r\n\r\nThus it became evident in Germany and in Austria that at St. Petersburg,\r\nfirst by diplomatic and political, then also by military, action a\r\ncomprehensive attack of Slavism under Russian guidance was being\r\nprepared. The party of the Grand Dukes in St. Petersburg, the party of\r\nthe Russian officers, always ready for war, and the Pan-Slavists, the\r\nbrutal and unscrupulous representatives of the idea that the Russian\r\nCzarism was destined to rule Europe--all these declared openly that\r\ntheir aim was the destruction of Austria-Hungary. In Russia the army,\r\nalready of an immense size, was increased secretly but comprehensively\r\nand as quick as possible; in Servia the same was done, and the Russian\r\nAmbassador in Belgrade, Mr. von Hartwig, was, after the second Balkan\r\nwar, the principal promoter of the plan to form against Austria a new\r\nBalkan alliance. In Bosnia, during all this time, the Servian propaganda\r\nwas at work with high treason, and in the end with revolver and the\r\nbomb.\r\n\r\nIn Vienna and in Berlin the greatness and the purpose of the new danger\r\ncould not remain doubtful, especially as it was openly said in St.\r\nPetersburg, in Belgrade, and elsewhere that the destruction of\r\nAustria-Hungary was imminent. As soon as the Balkan troubles began\r\nAustria-Hungary had been obliged to put a large part of her army in\r\nreadiness for war, because the Russians and Servians had mobilized on\r\ntheir frontiers. The Germans felt that what was a danger for their ally\r\nwas also a danger for them and that they must do all in the power to\r\nmaintain Austria-Hungary in the position of a great power. They felt\r\nthat this could only be done by keeping perfect faith with their ally\r\nand by great military strength, so that Russia might possibly be\r\ndeterred from war and peace be preserved, or else that, in case war was\r\nforced upon them, they could wage it with honor and success. Now it was\r\nclear in Berlin that in view of the Russian and Servian preparations,\r\nAustria-Hungary, in case of a war, would be obliged to use a great part\r\nof her forces against Servia and therefore would have to send against\r\nRussia fewer troops than would have been possible under the conditions\r\nformerly prevailing in Europe. Formerly even European Turkey could have\r\nbeen counted upon for assistance, that after her recent defeat seemed\r\nvery doubtful. These reasons and considerations, which were solely of a\r\ndefensive nature, led to the great German military bills of the last two\r\nyears. Also Austria-Hungary was obliged to increase its defensive\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nWhoever considers carefully the course of events that has been briefly\r\nsketched here will pronounce the assertion of our enemies, that Germany\r\nwanted the war, ridiculous and absurd. On the contrary, it can be said\r\nthat Germany never before endeavored more eagerly to preserve peace than\r\nduring the last few years. Germany had plenty of opportunities to attack\r\nand good opportunities to boot, for we knew for years that the army of\r\nFrance was no more ready than that of Russia. But the Germans are not a\r\nwarlike nation and the German Emperor, with his Government, has always\r\nshown how earnestly he meant his reiterated assertions that the\r\npreservation of peace was his principal aim. He was actuated in this by\r\ngeneral considerations of humanity, justice, and culture, as well as by\r\nthe consideration of the German trade and commerce. This, especially the\r\ntransoceanic commerce of Germany, has increased from year to year. War,\r\nhowever, means the ruin of commerce. Why expose Germany needlessly to\r\nthis terrible risk, especially as everything in Germany prospered and\r\nher wealth increased? No, the German Army bills were merely meant to\r\nprotect us against, and prepare us for, the attacks of Muscovite\r\nbarbarism. But nobody in Germany has ever doubted for a moment that\r\nFrance would attack us at the first Russian signal. Since the first days\r\nof the Franco-Russian alliance things have become entirely reversed.\r\nThen France wanted to win Russia for a war of revenge against Germany;\r\nnow, on the contrary, France thought herself obliged to place her power\r\nand her existence at the disposal of the Russian lust of conquest.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1914 the German press reported from St. Petersburg\r\ndetailed accounts of Russia's comprehensive preparations for war. They\r\nwere not denied in Russia, and Paris declared that Russia would be ready\r\nin two or three years and then pursue a policy corresponding to her\r\npower; France, too, would then be at the height of her power. If the\r\nGerman Government had desired war, on the strength of these accounts,\r\nwhich were true, it could have waged a preventive war at once and\r\neasily. It did not do so, considering that a war is just only when it is\r\nforced upon one by the enemy. Thus Spring went by with the atmosphere\r\nat high tension. From St. Petersburg and Paris overbearing threats came\r\nin increasing numbers to the effect that the power of the Dual Alliance\r\nwas now gigantic and that Germany and Austria soon would begin to feel\r\nit. We remained quiet and watchful, endeavoring with perseverance and\r\nwith all our might to win over Great Britain to the policy of preserving\r\npeace. Colonial and economic questions were being discussed by the\r\nGerman and English Governments, and the cordiality between the two great\r\npowers seemed only to be equaled by their mutual confidence.\r\n\r\nThen on the 28th of June occurred that frightful assassination by\r\nServians of the successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke\r\nFrancis Ferdinand. The Greater Servia propaganda of action had put aside\r\nthe man who was especially hated in Servia as the powerful exponent of\r\nAustro-Hungarian unity and strength. This murder is the real cause of\r\nthe present European war. Austria-Hungary was able to prove to a\r\nshuddering world, a few days after the murder, that it had been prepared\r\nand planned systematically, yea, that the Servian Government had been\r\ncognizant of the plan. The immense extent of the Servian revolutionary\r\norganization in the provinces of Southern Austria, the warlike spirit of\r\nthe Servians and its instigation by Russia and France, imposed upon the\r\nVienna Government the duty to insist upon quiet and peace within and\r\nwithout its borders. It addressed to the Servian Government a number of\r\ndemands which aimed at nothing but the suppression of the anti-Austrian\r\npropaganda. Servia was on the point of accepting the demand, when there\r\narrived a dispatch from St. Petersburg, and Servia mobilized. Then\r\nAustria, too, had to act. Thus arose the Austro-Servian war. But a few\r\ndays later the Russian Army was being mobilized, and the mobilization\r\nwas begun also in France. At the same time, as the German \"White Book\"\r\nclearly proves, the diplomacy of Russia and France asserted its great\r\nlove of peace and tried to prolong the negotiations in order to gain\r\ntime, for, as is well known, the Russian mobilization proceeds slowly.\r\nGermany was waiting, and again and again the German Emperor tried to win\r\nthe Czar over to the preservation of peace, for he considered him\r\nsincere and thought him his personal friend. Emperor William was to be\r\ncruelly disappointed. He finally saw himself obliged to proclaim a state\r\nof war for Germany. But at that time the Russian and French armies were\r\nalready in a state of complete mobilization. At that time The London\r\nDaily Graphic wrote the following article, which shows how an English\r\npaper that was only slightly friendly to Germany judged of the situation\r\nat that time:\r\n\r\n     The Mobilization Mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A general mobilization has been ordered in Russia, and Germany has\r\n     responded by proclaiming martial law throughout the empire. We are\r\n     now enabled to measure exactly the narrow and slippery ledge which\r\n     still stands between Europe and the abyss of Armageddon. Will the\r\n     Russian order be acted upon in the provinces adjoining the German\r\n     frontier? If it is, then the work of the peacemakers is at an end,\r\n     for Germany is bound to reply with a mobilization of her own armed\r\n     forces, and a rush to the frontiers on all sides must ensue. We\r\n     confess that we are unable to understand the action of Russia in\r\n     view of the resumption of the negotiations with Austria. It is not\r\n     likely that these negotiations have been resumed unless both sides\r\n     think that there is yet a chance of agreement, but if this is the\r\n     case, why the mobilization which goes far beyond the limits of\r\n     necessary precaution, and is, indeed, calculated to defeat the\r\n     efforts of the diplomatists, however promising they may be? There\r\n     may, of course, be a satisfactory explanation, but as the matter\r\n     stands it is inexplicable, and is all the more regrettable because\r\n     it is calculated--we feel sure unjustly--to cast doubts on the\r\n     loyalty and straightforwardness of the Russian Government.\r\n\r\nWhen Russia had let pass the time limit set by Germany, when France had\r\nanswered that she would act according to her own interests, then the\r\nGerman Empire had to mobilize its army and go ahead. Before one German\r\nsoldier had crossed the German frontier a large number of French\r\naeroplanes came flying into our country across the neutral territory of\r\nBelgium and Luxemburg without a word of warning on the part of the\r\nBelgian Government. At the same time the German Government learned that\r\nthe French were about to enter Belgium. Then our Government, with great\r\nreluctance, had to decide upon requesting the Belgian Government to\r\nallow our troops to march through its territory. Belgium was to be\r\nindemnified after the war, was to retain its sovereignty and integrity.\r\nBelgium protested, at the same time allowing, by an agreement with\r\nFrance, that the French troops might enter Belgium. After all this, and\r\nnot till France and Belgium itself had broken the neutrality, our troops\r\nentered the neutral territory. Germany wanted nothing from Belgium, but\r\nhad to prevent that Belgian soil be used as a gate of entrance into\r\nGerman territory.\r\n\r\nLittle has as yet been said of Great Britain. It was Germany's\r\nconviction that the sincerity of Britain's love for peace could be\r\ntrusted. At any rate, Sir Edward Grey and Mr. Asquith asserted again and\r\nagain in the course of the last few years that England wished friendly\r\nrelations with Germany and never would lend its support to a\r\nFranco-Russian attack on Germany. Now this attack had been made; Germany\r\nwas on the defensive against two powerful enemies. What would Great\r\nBritain do about it? That was the question. Great Britain asked in\r\nreturn for its neutrality that the German forces should not enter\r\nBelgium. In other words, it asked that Germany should allow the French\r\nand Belgian troops to form on Belgian territory for a march against our\r\nfrontier! This we could not allow. It would have been suicidal. The\r\nGerman Government made Great Britain, in return for its neutrality, the\r\nfollowing offers: we would not attack the northern coast of France, we\r\nwould leave unmolested the maritime commerce of France and would\r\nindemnify Belgium after the war and safeguard its sovereignty and\r\nintegrity. In spite of this Great Britain declared war on Germany and\r\nsides today with those Continental powers that have united for our\r\ndestruction, in order that Muscovite barbarism may rule Europe. We know\r\nthat Germany did not deserve such treatment on the part of Great\r\nBritain, and do not believe that Great Britain by this action did a\r\nservice to humanity and civilization.\r\n\r\nToday we are facing hard facts. Germany has to fight for her existence.\r\nShe will fight knowing that the great powers beyond the ocean will do\r\nher justice as soon as they know the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREICHSTAG AND EMPEROR.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland, France, and Russia, unthreatened by Germany, go to war for\r\npolitical reasons--Germany defends her independence and fights for her\r\nvery existence, for her future as a great power--How a peaceful people\r\nwere imbued with the spirit of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last days of the month of July were days of anxiety and distress for\r\nthe German people. They hoped that they would be permitted to preserve\r\nan honorable peace. A few months earlier, in 1913, when the centennial\r\nof the war for independence from French oppression and the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of Emperor William's ascent of the throne had been\r\ncelebrated, they had willingly taken upon their shoulders the great\r\nsacrifice of the so-called \"Wehrvorlage,\" which increased the peace\r\nstrength of the standing army enormously and cost 1,000,000,000 marks.\r\nThey considered it simply as an increase of their peace insurance\r\npremium. Our diplomats worked hard for the maintenance of peace, for the\r\nlocalization of the Austro-Servian war. So sure were the leading men of\r\nthe empire of the preservation of general peace that at the beginning of\r\nthe week which was to bring general mobilization they said to each other\r\njoyfully: Next week our vacation time begins. But they were fearfully\r\ndisappointed. Russia's unexpected, treacherous mobilization compelled\r\nGermany to draw the sword also. On the evening of the first day of\r\nAugust the one word, Mobilization! was flashed by the electric spark all\r\nover the country. There was no more anxiety and uncertainty. Cool, firm\r\nresolution at once permeated the entire German folk. The Reichstag was\r\ncalled together for an extra session.\r\n\r\nThree days later, on the anniversary of the battles of Weissenburg and\r\nSpichern, the representatives of the German people met. This session,\r\nwhich lasted only a few hours, proved worthy of the great historical\r\nmoment marking the beginning of such a conflagration as the world had\r\nnever seen before. The railroad lines were under military control and\r\nused almost exclusively for purposes of mobilization. In spite of all\r\nsuch difficulties, more than 300 of the 397 Deputies managed to get to\r\nBerlin in time. The rest sent word that they were unable to come. On the\r\nevening of Aug. 3 the Imperial Chancellor called the leaders of all\r\nparties, including the Socialists, to his house and explained to them in\r\na concise and impressive statement how frivolously Germany had been\r\ndriven to war. At the time of this meeting the unanimous acceptance of\r\nall war measures by the Reichstag was already assured. In numerous\r\nconferences the heads of the several departments explained the content\r\nand meaning of the bills to be submitted to the Reichstag. The\r\nparticipants of the conferences showed already what spirit would\r\ncharacterize the next day. The session of the Reichstag filled the\r\nentire German nation with pride and enthusiasm; the Reichstag maintained\r\nthe dignity of the German Empire and the German people.\r\n\r\nIn greater numbers than ever before the Deputies, high officers of the\r\narmy and navy and the Civil Government assembled on Aug. 4, first in\r\nhouses of worship to pray to God, and then in the Royal Castle of\r\nBerlin. The military character of the ceremony at the opening of the\r\nsession showed under what auspices this memorable act took place. The\r\nKaiser entered the hall in the simple gray field uniform, without the\r\nusual pomp, unaccompanied by chamberlains and court officials and pages\r\nin glittering court dresses. Only State Ministers, Generals, and\r\nAdmirals followed him to the throne, from where he read his speech,\r\nafter covering his head with his helmet. His voice betrayed the strain\r\nunder which he was laboring. Repeatedly he was interrupted by\r\nenthusiastic applause, and when he closed, a rousing cheer thundered\r\nthrough the famous White Hall, something that had never before occurred\r\nthere since the erection of the old castle. Then came a surprise. The\r\nEmperor laid down the manuscript of his speech and continued speaking.\r\nFrom now on he knew only Germans, he said, no differences of party,\r\ncreed, religion or social position, and he requested the party leaders\r\nto give him their hands as a pledge that they all would stand by him \"in\r\nNot und Tod\"--in death and distress. This scene was entirely impromptu,\r\nand thus so much more impressive and touching. And it was hardly over\r\nwhen the Reichstag--an unheard of proceeding in such surroundings--began\r\nto sing the German national hymn, \"Heil Dir im Siegerkranz.\" The\r\nmagnificent hall, until then only the scene of pompous court\r\nfestivities, witnessed an outburst of patriotism such as was never seen\r\nthere before. To the accompaniment of loud cheers the Kaiser walked out,\r\nafter shaking the hands of the Imperial Chancellor and the Chief of the\r\nGeneral Staff, von Moltke.\r\n\r\nOne hour later the Reichstag met in its own house. The Emperor had\r\nbegged for quick and thorough work. He was not to be disappointed.\r\nWithout any formalities the presiding officers of the last session were\r\nre-elected--in times of peace and party strife this would have been\r\nimpossible. This short curtain raiser being over, the first act of the\r\ndrama began. Before an overcrowded house the Chancellor described simply\r\nand clearly the efforts of the Government for the preservation of peace.\r\nHe stated cold facts, showing unmistakably Russia's double dealing and\r\njustifying Germany's beginning of a war which she did not want. The\r\nChancellor had begun in a quiet, subdued tone. Then he raised his voice\r\nand when, in words that rang through the hall, he declared that the\r\nentire nation was united, the Deputies and the spectators in the\r\ngalleries could sit still no longer. They rose, with them at first some\r\nSocialists, then all of them, carried away by the impulse of the\r\nmoment; the members of the Federal Council, of the press, diplomats and\r\nthe crowds in the galleries joined them. The whole multitude cheered and\r\nclapped its hands frantically. It reflected truly the spirit of the\r\nwhole nation. The Speaker, who under ordinary circumstances would have\r\nsuppressed the clapping of hands as unparliamentary and the\r\ndemonstrations of the galleries as undignified, let the patriotic\r\noutburst go on to its end.\r\n\r\nAfter a short intermission the business meeting began. Sixteen war\r\nmeasures had been introduced, the most important of which was the one\r\nasking for 5,000,000,000 marks to carry on the war. The leader of the\r\nSocial Democrats read a statement explaining why his party, despite its\r\nopposition on principle to all army and navy appropriations, would vote\r\nfor the proposed bills. Without further debates all the bills were\r\npassed, and shortly after 5 P.M. the Reichstag adjourned. At 7 P.M. the\r\nEmperor received the presiding officers of the Reichstag to thank them\r\nfor their prompt and useful work. He signed the bills, which were\r\nimmediately published and thus became laws.\r\n\r\nThe resolute attitude and quick work of the Reichstag reflected the\r\nunity and resolution of the entire nation. Sixty-seven millions of\r\nGermans feel, think, and act with their elected representatives. No\r\nparty, no class, no creed is standing back; all are imbued with one\r\nsingle thought: United Germany is unconquerable.\r\n\r\nThe entire German people are united as never before in their history.\r\nEven 101 years ago, in 1813, the entire population cannot have been so\r\nuniformly seized by the spirit of war as at the outbreak of this\r\nstruggle, which is the people's war in the truest sense of the word, and\r\nwhich was predicted by Bismarck. All reigning Princes are going out to\r\nfight with the army and have appointed their wives as regents. Instances\r\ninclude the Kaiser's son-in-law, the Duke of Brunswick, who appointed\r\nhis consort, the only daughter of the Emperor, as regent. The Princes\r\ncall their people to arms, and they themselves all stand ready to\r\nsacrifice all they have. This example from above carries the nation with\r\nthem. The Reichstag knew parties and factions no more, and neither does\r\nthe nation. The Emperor sounded the word which has become common\r\nproperty from Königsberg to Constance, from Upper Silesia to the Belgian\r\nfrontier: \"I know only Germans!\" And yet how terribly is our nation\r\notherwise disrupted by party strife. Ill-advised persons across our\r\nfrontiers hoped that creed differences would make for disunion,\r\nFrenchmen and Russians expected to weaken our empire with the aid of\r\nAlsatians and Poles. This hope has been destroyed--we are a united\r\npeople, as united as was the Reichstag, the Socialists included. The\r\nlatter have for years voted against all army and navy appropriations,\r\nhave advocated international peace, and last year voted against the\r\nbills increasing the army strength. In many foreign quarters strong\r\nhopes were nourished that this party would help them. But those men did\r\nnot know our German people. Our civilization, our independence as a\r\nnation was threatened, and in that moment party interest or creed\r\nexisted no more. The true German heart is beating only for the\r\nFatherland, east and west, north and south, Protestants, Catholics, and\r\nJews are \"a united people of brethren in the hour of danger.\" When\r\nGermany was so threatened by Russia, when the German \"Peace Emperor\" was\r\nshamefully betrayed by the Czar of all the Russians, then there was but\r\none sacred party in existence: The party of Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN MOBILIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clockworks of mobilization; perfect order and quiet\r\neverywhere--General acceptance by all classes and factions of the\r\nnecessities of a war not sought by Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German mobilization was the greatest movement of people that the\r\nworld has ever seen. Nearly four million men had to be transported from\r\nevery part of the empire to her borders. The manner in which the\r\npopulation is distributed made this task extremely difficult. Berlin,\r\nRhenish Westphalia, Upper Silesia and Saxony especially had to send\r\ntheir contingents in every direction, since the eastern provinces are\r\nmore thinly settled and had to have a stronger guard for the borders\r\nimmediately. The result was a hurrying to and fro of thousands and\r\nhundreds of thousands of soldiers, besides a flood of civilians who had\r\nto reach their homes as soon as possible. Countries where the population\r\nis more regularly distributed have an easier task than Germany, with its\r\npredominating urban population. The difficulties of the gigantic\r\nundertaking were also increased by the necessity for transporting war\r\nmaterials of every sort. In the west are chiefly industrial\r\nundertakings, in the east mainly agricultural. Horse raising is mostly\r\nconfined to the provinces on the North Sea and the Baltic, but chiefly\r\nto East Prussia, and this province, the furthest away from France, had\r\nto send its best horses to the western border, as did also\r\nSchleswig-Holstein and Hanover. Coal for our warships had to go in the\r\nother direction. From the Rhenish mines it went to the North Sea, from\r\nUpper Silesia to the Baltic. Ammunition and heavy projectiles were\r\ntransported from the central part of the empire to the borders. And\r\neverywhere these operations had to be carried on with haste. One can\r\nthus say that the German mobilization was the greatest movement of men\r\nand materials that the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nAnd how was it carried on? No one could have wondered if there had been\r\nhundreds of unforeseen incidents, if military trains had arrived at\r\ntheir stations with great delays, if there had resulted in many places a\r\nwild hugger-mugger from the tremendous problems on hand. But there was\r\nnot a trace of this. On the Monday evening of the first week of\r\nmobilization a high officer of the General Staff said: \"It had to go\r\nwell today, but how about tomorrow, the main day?\" Tuesday evening saw\r\nno reason for complaint, no delay, no requests for instructions. All had\r\nmoved with the regularity of clockwork. Regiments that had been ordered\r\nto mobilize in the forenoon left in the evening for the field, fully\r\nequipped. Not a man was lacking. There were no deserters, no shirkers,\r\nno cowards. Instead, there were volunteers whose numbers far exceeded\r\nthe number that could be used. Every German wanted to do his duty.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy thing was the earnest quietness with which the\r\ngigantic gathering proceeded. Not a city, not a village reported unrest\r\nor even an untoward incident. The separation was hard for many a\r\nsoldier. Many a volunteer tore himself away from his dear ones with\r\nbleeding heart, but with face beaming with the light of one who looks\r\nforward to victory. Following the Kaiser's wish, those who remained\r\nbehind filled the churches and, kneeling, prayed to God for victory for\r\nthe just German cause. The folk-war, brought on by the wantonness of the\r\nopponents, in itself brought peace and order, safety and discipline.\r\nNever, probably, have the police had fewer excesses to deal with than in\r\nthe days of the mobilization, although great crowds gathered constantly\r\nin every city.\r\n\r\nThe best criterion of the enthusiasm of the people is without doubt the\r\nnumber of volunteers. More than 1,000,000 of these, a number greater\r\nthan that of the standing army, presented themselves within a few days.\r\nThey came from all classes. There were sons of the nobility, university\r\nstudents, farmers, merchants, common laborers. No calling hung back.\r\nEvery young man sorrowed when he was rejected. No section of the\r\nFatherland was unrepresented, not even the Reichsland Alsace-Lorraine,\r\nwhere, indeed, the number of volunteers was conspicuously great. When\r\nthe lists in various cities had to be closed, the young men who had not\r\nbeen accepted turned away with tears in their eyes, and telegraphed from\r\nregiment to regiment, hoping to find one where there were still\r\nvacancies. Where the sons of the wealthy renounced the pleasures of\r\nyouth and the comforts of their homes to accept the hardships of war in\r\nserving the Fatherland, the poor and the poorest appeared in like\r\ndegree. In families having four or five sons subject to military duty a\r\nyoungest son, not yet liable for service, volunteered. The year 1870,\r\ntruly a proud year in our history, saw nothing like this.\r\n\r\nA thing that raised the national enthusiasm still higher was the\r\nappearance of the troops in brand-new uniforms, complete from head to\r\nfoot. The first sight of these new uniforms of modest field gray,\r\nfaultlessly made, evoked everywhere the question: Where did they come\r\nfrom? On the first day of mobilization dozens of cloth manufacturers\r\nappeared at the War Ministry with offers of the new material. \"We don't\r\nneed any,\" was the astonishing reply. Equal amazement was caused by the\r\nfaultless new boots and shoes of the troops, especially in view of the\r\nrecent famous \"boot speech\" of the French Senator Humbert.\r\n\r\nSmall arms, cannons, and ammunition are so plentiful that they have\r\nmerely to be unpacked. In view of all this, it is no wonder that the\r\nregiments marching in were everywhere greeted with jubilation, and that\r\nthose marching out took leave of their garrisons with joyful songs. No\r\none thinks of death and destruction, every one of victory and a happy\r\nreunion. German discipline, once so slandered, now celebrates its\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nThere was still another matter in which the troops gave their countrymen\r\ncause for rejoicing. Not one drunken man was seen during these earnest\r\ndays in the city streets. The General Staff had, moreover, wisely\r\nordered that during the mobilization, when every one had money in his\r\npockets, alcoholic drinks were not to be sold at the railroad stations.\r\nDespite this, the soldiers did not lack for refreshments on their\r\njourney. Women and girls offered their services to the Red Cross, and\r\nthere was no station where coffee, tea, milk, and substantial food were\r\nnot at the disposal of the soldiers. They were not required to suffer\r\nhunger or any other discomfort. The German anti-alcoholists are\r\nrejoicing at this earnest tribute to their principles, which were at\r\nfirst laughed at and then pitied, but triumphed in the days of the\r\nmobilization.\r\n\r\nThe army is increased to many times its ordinary strength by the\r\nmobilization. It draws from everywhere millions of soldiers, workmen,\r\nhorses, wagons, and other material. The entire railway service is at its\r\ndisposal. The mobilization of the fleet goes on more quietly and less\r\nconspicuously, but not less orderly and smoothly. Indeed, it is, even in\r\npeace times, practically mobilized as to its greatest and strongest\r\nunits. For this reason its transports are smaller than those of the\r\narmy; they are concentrated in a few harbors, and, therefore, do not\r\nattract so much public attention. The naval transports, working\r\naccording to plans in connection with those of the army, have moved\r\ntheir quotas of men and materials with the most punctual exactitude. The\r\nnaval reserve of fully trained officers and men is practically\r\ninexhaustible. The faithful work of our shipbuilding concerns, carried\r\non uninterruptedly day and night under plans carefully prepared in time\r\nof peace, has wrought for our navy a strong increase in powerful\r\nwarships.\r\n\r\nAs is known, the German fleet is built on the so-called\r\n\"assumption-of-risk\" plan. That is, it is intended that it shall be so\r\nstrong that even the strongest sea power, in a conflict with the\r\nGermans, risks forfeiting its former rôle as a world factor. This \"risk\"\r\nidea has been hammered into the heart of every German seaman, and they\r\nare all eager to win for the fleet such glory that it can be favorably\r\ncontrasted with the deeds of the old and the new armies.\r\n\r\nContrary to general expectation, the German fleet has taken the\r\noffensive, and the first loss of the war was on the English side and in\r\nEnglish waters, the English cruiser Amphion running on to German mines\r\nin the mouth of the Thames. In the Baltic and the Mediterranean also\r\nGerman ships have taken the offensive against the enemies' coast, as is\r\nshown by the bombardment by the Germans of the war harbor of Libau and\r\nof fortified landing places on the Algerian coast.\r\n\r\nThus the fleet, confiding in the \"risk\" idea now proved to be true, and\r\nin its earnest and courageous spirit, may look forward with confidence\r\nto coming events.\r\n\r\nBut will not civilians have to hunger and thirst in these days? That is\r\nan earnest question. The answer is, No. Even in Berlin, city of\r\nmillions, the milk supply did not fail for a day. Infants will not have\r\nto bear the privations of war. All provisions are to be had at\r\nreasonable prices. Empire, municipalities and merchants are working\r\nsuccessfully together to insure that there shall be a sufficient food\r\nsupply at not too great a cost. Not only is our great army mobilized,\r\nbut the whole folk is mobilized, and the distribution of labor, the food\r\nquestion and the care of the sick and wounded are all being provided\r\nfor. The whole German folk has become a gigantic war camp, all are\r\nmobilized to protect Kaiser, Folk and Fatherland, as the closing report\r\nof the Reichstag put it. And all Germany pays the tribute of a salute to\r\nthe chiefs of the army and navy, who work with deeds, not words.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARMY AND NAVY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German Army and Navy on the watch--Four million German men in the\r\nfield--Thousands of volunteers join the colors to fight for Germany's\r\nexistence, among them the flower of her scientific and artistic life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no greater contrast than that between the United States and\r\nGermany in one of the most important questions of existence with which a\r\nState is confronted. In its whole history the United States has never\r\nhad a foreign hostile force of invaders upon its territory, foreign\r\narmies have never laid waste its fields. Until late in the last century,\r\nhowever, Germany was the battlefield for the then most powerful nations\r\nof Europe. The numerous German States and provinces, too, fought among\r\nthemselves, often on behalf of foreign powers. The European great powers\r\nof that day were able, unhindered and unpunished, to take for themselves\r\npiece after piece of German territory. In the United States, on the\r\nother hand, it was years before the steadily increasing population\r\nattained to the boundaries set for it by nature.\r\n\r\nOur Bismarck was finally able, in the years from 1864 to 1871, to create\r\na great empire from the many small German States. As he himself often\r\nremarked, however, this was possible only because his policies and\r\ndiplomacy rested upon and were supported by a well trained and powerful\r\narmy. How the German Empire came into being at that time is well known.\r\nA war was necessary because of the fact that the then so powerful France\r\ndid not desire that North and South Germany should unite. She was not\r\nable to prevent this union, was defeated and had to give back to us two\r\nold German provinces which she had stolen from the Germans. The old\r\nField Marshal von Moltke said not long after the war of 1870-71 that the\r\nGermans would still have to defend Alsace-Lorraine for fifty years more.\r\nPerhaps he little realized how prophetic his words were, but he and\r\nthose who followed him, the German Emperors and the German War\r\nMinisters, prepared themselves for this coming defensive struggle and\r\nunremittingly devoted their attention to the German Army.\r\n\r\nFrom 1887 on there had been no doubt that in the event of war with\r\nFrance we should have to reckon also with Russia. This meant that the\r\narmy must be strong enough to be equal to the coming fight on two\r\nborders--a tremendous demand upon the resources of a land when one\r\nconsiders that a peaceful folk, devoted to agriculture, industry, and\r\ntrade, must live for decades in the constant expectation of being\r\nobliged, be it tomorrow, be it in ten years, to fight for its life\r\nagainst its two great military neighbors simultaneously. There are,\r\nmoreover, the great money expenditures, and also the burden of universal\r\nmilitary service, which, as is well known, requires every able-bodied\r\nmale German to serve a number of years with the colors, and later to\r\nhold himself ready, first as a reservist, then as member of the\r\nLandwehr, and finally as member of the Landsturm, to spring to arms at\r\nthe call of his supreme war lord, the German Emperor. A warlike,\r\nmilitant nation would not long have endured such conditions, but would\r\nhave compelled a war and carried it through swiftly. As Bismarck said,\r\nhowever, the German Army, since it is an army of the folk itself, is not\r\na weapon for frivolous aggression. Since the German Army, when it is\r\nsummoned to war, represents the whole German people, and since the whole\r\nGerman people is peaceably disposed, it follows that the army can only\r\nbe a defensive organization. If war comes, millions of Germans must go\r\nto the front, must leave their parents, their families, their children.\r\nThey must. And this \"must\" means not only the command of their Emperor,\r\nbut also the necessity to defend their own land. Did not this necessity\r\nexist, these sons, husbands, and fathers would assuredly not go gladly\r\nto the battlefield, and it is likewise certain that those who stayed at\r\nhome would not rejoice so enthusiastically to see them go as we Germans\r\nhave seen them rejoicing in these days. Again, then, let us repeat that\r\nthe German Army is a weapon which can be and is used only for defense\r\nagainst foreign aggressions. When these aggressions come, the whole\r\nGerman folk stands with its army, as it does now.\r\n\r\nThe German Army is divided into 25 corps in times of peace. In war times\r\nreservists, members of the Landwehr, and occasionally also of the\r\nLandsturm, are called to the colors. The result is that the German Army\r\non a war footing is a tremendously powerful organ.\r\n\r\nOur opponents in foreign countries have for years consistently\r\nendeavored to awaken the belief that the German soldier does his\r\nobligatory service very unwillingly, that he does not get enough to eat\r\nand is badly treated. These assertions are false, and anybody who has\r\nseen in these weeks of mobilization how our soldiers, reservists, and\r\nLandwehr men departed for the field or reported at the garrisons,\r\nanybody who has seen their happy, enthusiastic and fresh faces knows\r\nthat mishandled men, men who have been drilled as machines, cannot\r\npresent such an appearance.\r\n\r\nOn the day the German mobilization was ordered we traveled with some\r\nAmericans from the western border to Berlin. These Americans said: \"We\r\ndo not know much about your army, but judging by what we have seen in\r\nthese days there prevails in it and all its arrangements such system\r\nthat it must win. System must win every time.\" In this saying there is,\r\nindeed, much of truth--order and system are the basis upon which the\r\nmighty organization of our army is built.\r\n\r\nNow a word concerning the German officer. He, too, has been much\r\nmaligned, he is often misunderstood by foreigners, and yet we believe\r\nthat the people of the United States in particular must be able to\r\nunderstand the German officer. One of the greatest sons of free America,\r\nGeorge Washington, gave his countrymen the advice to select only\r\ngentlemen as officers, and it is according to this principle that the\r\nofficers of the German Army and Navy are chosen. Their selection is\r\nmade, moreover, upon a democratic basis, in that the officers' corps of\r\nthe various regiments decide for themselves whether they will or will\r\nnot accept as a comrade the person whose name is proposed to them.\r\n\r\nOne sees that the German Army is not, as many say, a tremendous machine,\r\nbut rather a great, living organism, which draws its strength and\r\nlifeblood from all classes of the whole German folk. The German Army can\r\ndevelop its entire strength only in a war which the folk approve, that\r\nis, when a defensive war has been forced upon them. That this is true\r\nwill have been realized by our friends in the United States before this\r\ncomes into their hands.\r\n\r\nThe German fleet is in like manner a weapon of defense. It was very\r\nsmall up to the end of the last century, but has since then been\r\nconsistently built up according to the ground principles which Mr.\r\nRoosevelt has so often in his powerful manner laid down for the American\r\nfleet. The question has often been asked, what is there for the German\r\nfleet to defend, since the German coastline is so short? The answer\r\nis that the strength of a fleet must not be made to depend upon the\r\nlength of coastlines, but upon how many ships and how much merchandise\r\ngo out from and enter the harbors, how great oversea interests there\r\nare, how large the colonies are and how they are situated, and, finally,\r\nhow strong the sea powers are with which Germany may have to carry on a\r\nwar and how they are situated. To meet all these requirements there is\r\nbut one remedy, namely, either that our fleet shall be strong enough to\r\nprevent the strongest sea power from conducting war against us, or that,\r\nif war does come, it shall be able so to battle against the mightiest\r\nopponent that the latter shall be seriously weakened.\r\n\r\nGermany, as especially the Americans know, has become a great merchant\r\nmarine nation, whose colonies are flourishing. Furthermore, since the\r\nland's growing population has greatly increased its strength in the\r\ncourse of the last years, the mistrust and jealousy of Great Britain\r\nhave in particular been directed steadily against the development of our\r\nocean commerce, and later of our navy. To the upbuilding of the German\r\nNavy were ascribed all manner of plans--to attack Great Britain, to make\r\nwar on Japan, &c. It was even declared by the English press that Germany\r\nintended to attack the United States as soon as its fleet was strong\r\nenough. Today, when Great Britain has needlessly declared war upon us,\r\nthe Americans will perhaps believe that our fleet was never planned or\r\nbuilt for an attack on any one. Germany desired simply to protect its\r\ncoasts and its marine interests in the same manner in which it protects\r\nits land boundaries. It is realized in the United States as well as here\r\nthat a fleet can be powerful only when it has a sufficient number of\r\nvessels of all classes, and when it is thoroughly and unremittingly\r\nschooled in times of peace. We have tried to attain this ideal in\r\nGermany, and it may be remarked that the training of the personnel\r\nrequires greater efforts here, since the principle of universal service\r\nis also applied to the fleet, with a resulting short term of service,\r\nwhereas all foreign fleets have a long term of enlistment.\r\n\r\nThe nominal strength of the German fleet is regulated by statute, as is\r\nalso the term--twenty years--at the expiration of which old vessels must\r\nautomatically be replaced by new ones. This fleet strength is set at\r\nforty-one line-of-battle ships, twenty armored cruisers and forty small\r\ncruisers, besides 144 torpedo boats and seventy-two submarine vessels.\r\nThese figures, however, have not been reached. To offset this fact,\r\nhowever, almost the whole German fleet has been kept together in home\r\nwaters. Great Britain's fleet is much stronger than ours, but despite\r\nthis the German fleet faces its great opponent with coolness and\r\nassurance and with that courage and readiness to undertake great deeds\r\nthat mark those who know that their land has been unjustifiably\r\nattacked. It is utterly incorrect to say, as has been said, that the\r\nGerman naval officers are filled with hatred for other navies,\r\nespecially for the British. On the contrary, the relations between\r\nGerman and English officers and men have always been good, almost as\r\ngood as those of the Germans with the American officers. It is not\r\npersonal hatred that inspires our officers and men with the lust for\r\nbattle, but their indignation over the unprovoked attack and the\r\nrealization that, if every one will do his best for the Fatherland in\r\nthis great hour, it will not be in vain even against the greatest naval\r\npower. We, too, are confident of this, for strenuous and faithful effort\r\nalways has its reward, and this is especially true of our fleet\r\norganization. The United States realizes this as well as we, for it,\r\ntoo, has built up a strong and admirably trained fleet by prodigious\r\nlabor. As is the case with the German fleet, the American Navy also is\r\nnot built for aggression, but for defense.\r\n\r\nNeutrality by the Grace of England.\r\n\r\nJanus, a mighty god of the ancient Romans, was represented as having two\r\nfaces. He could smile and frown simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis god Janus is the personification of neutrality according to English\r\nideas. Neutrality smiles when violated by England and frowns when\r\nviolated by other powers.\r\n\r\nThe United States got a taste of England's neutrality when, a century\r\nago, the English impressed thousands of American sailors, taking them\r\nfrom American ships on the high seas, when they searched neutral ships\r\nand confiscated the enemy's property on board of them, until Congress in\r\nWashington voted for the declaration of war against England.\r\n\r\nIn the great civil war, 1861 to 1864, England had counted on the victory\r\nof the Southern States; she recognized them as belligerents and supplied\r\nthem with warships. This was not considered by England a breach of\r\nneutrality until the Minister of the United States declared, on Sept. 5,\r\n1863, that unless England desisted war would result. England yielded.\r\n\r\nBut, according to the old German proverb, \"A cat cannot resist catching\r\nmice,\" she secretly permitted the fitting out of privateers (the\r\nAlabama) for the Southern States and was finally forced to pay an\r\nindemnity of $15,000,000. England gained, however, more than she lost by\r\nthis interpretation of neutrality, for by the aid of her privateers\r\nAmerican maritime trade passed into English hands and was lost to the\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nMay God's vengeance fall on Germany! She has violated Belgium's\r\nneutrality! the English piously ejaculate. They call themselves God's\r\nchosen people, the instrument of Providence for the benefit of the whole\r\nuniverse. They look down upon all other peoples with open or silent\r\ncontempt, and claim for themselves various prerogatives, in particular\r\nthe supremacy of the sea, even in American waters, from Jamaica to\r\nHalifax.\r\n\r\nEngland's policy has always been to take all, to give back nothing, to\r\nconstantly demand more, to begrudge others everything. Only where the\r\nNew World is concerned has England, conscious of her own weakness,\r\nbecome less grasping, since Benjamin Franklin \"wrested the sceptre from\r\nthe tyrants,\" since the small colonies that fought so valiantly for\r\ntheir liberty rose to form the greatest dominion of the white race.\r\n\r\nIn the Summer of 1911, during the Franco-German Morocco dispute, the\r\nEnglish were determined to assist their old enemies, the French, against\r\nGermany, and stationed 160,000 troops along their coast ready for\r\nembarkation. For the French coast? No, indeed! For transportation to\r\nAntwerp, where the English were to unite with the French Army and\r\ncombine in the destruction of the German forces. But things did not\r\nreach that stage. England was not ready. England and France were\r\nresolved not to respect the neutrality of Belgium--the same England that\r\nsolemnly assures the world that she has never at any time or place\r\ncommitted a breach of neutrality. England has observed neutrality only\r\nwhen compatible with her own interests, which has not often been the\r\ncase. Her whole dissimulating policy is much more questionable than our\r\none breach of neutrality, committed in self-defense and accompanied by\r\nthe most solemn promises of indemnity and restitution.\r\n\r\nEngland and France did not give up their plan of attacking Germany\r\nthrough Belgium, and by this means won the approval of the Muscovites.\r\nThree against one! It would have been a crime against the German people\r\nif the German General Staff had not anticipated this intention. The\r\ninalienable right of self-defense gives the individual, whose very\r\nexistence is at stake, the moral liberty to resort to weapons which\r\nwould be forbidden except in times of peril. As Belgium would,\r\nnevertheless, not acquiesce in a friendly neutrality which would permit\r\nthe unobstructed passage of German troops through small portions of her\r\nterritory, although her integrity was guaranteed, the German General\r\nStaff was obliged to force this passage in order to avoid the necessity\r\nof meeting the enemy on the most unfavorable ground.\r\n\r\nThe Germans have not forgotten the tone in which the French and Belgian\r\npress reported the frequent excursions of French Staff officers and\r\nGenerals for the purpose of making an exhaustive study of the territory\r\nthrough which the armies are now moving, and who were received with open\r\narms in Belgium and treated like brothers. Belgium has become the vassal\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nIn our place the Government of the United States would not have acted\r\ndifferently. \"Inter arma silent leges\"--in the midst of arms the laws\r\nare silent. Besides, England had interfered beforehand in Germany's plan\r\nof campaign by declaring that she would not tolerate an attack upon the\r\nnorthern coast of France.\r\n\r\nThe German troops, with their iron discipline, will respect the personal\r\nliberty and property of the individual in Belgium, just as they did in\r\nFrance in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe Belgians would have been wise if they had permitted the passage of\r\nthe German troops. They would have preserved their integrity, and,\r\nbesides that, would have fared well from the business point of view, for\r\nthe army would have proved a good customer and paid cash.\r\n\r\nGermany has always been a good and just neighbor, to Belgium as well as\r\nto the other small powers such as Holland, Denmark and Switzerland,\r\nwhich England in her place would have swallowed up one and all long ago.\r\n\r\nThe development of industry on the lower Rhine has added to the\r\nprosperity of Belgium and has made Antwerp one of the first ports on the\r\nContinent, as well as one of the most important centres of exchange for\r\nGerman-American trade.\r\n\r\nWithout Germany Belgium could never have acquired the Congo.\r\n\r\nWhen England meditated taking possession of the Congo, claiming that\r\ngreat rivers are nothing but arms of the sea and consequently belong to\r\nthe supreme maritime power, King Leopold turned to Germany for\r\nprotection and received it from Bismarck, who called the Congo\r\nConference of 1884-5 and obtained the recognition by the powers of the\r\nindependence of the Congo State.\r\n\r\nThe struggle of the German States in Europe has some points in common\r\nwith the struggle of the Independent States of North America (from 1778\r\nto 1783), for it is directed chiefly against England's scheming\r\nguardianship, and her practice of weakening the Continental powers by\r\nsowing or fostering dissension among them.\r\n\r\nWhile continually protesting her love of peace, England has carried on\r\nno fewer than forty wars during the latter half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, including the great Boer war. She has long imperiled, and in\r\nthe end has succeeded in disturbing, the peace of Europe by her\r\ninvidious policy of isolating Germany. Germany, on the other hand, has\r\nproved herself since 1871 to be the strongest and most reliable security\r\nfor the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe policy of sowing dissension, practiced by England more industriously\r\nthan ever in recent years, cannot possibly meet with the approval of the\r\npeace-loving citizens of the United States, and should be condemned on\r\nmerely humanitarian as well as commercial grounds.\r\n\r\nEngland aims at being mistress of the Old World in order to occupy\r\neither an equal, or a menacing, position toward the New World, as\r\ncircumstances may dictate. For this purpose she has encouraged this war.\r\nThe German Federated States of Europe are defending themselves with\r\nmight and main, and are counting in this struggle for existence on the\r\ngood-will of the United States of America, for whose citizens they\r\ncherish the friendliest feelings, as they have proved at all times. All\r\nAmericans who have visited Germany will surely bear witness to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATTITUDES OF GERMANY'S ENEMIES.\r\n\r\nGermany overrun by spies for years past.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that in time of war the respective participants\r\nseek to gain for themselves every possible advantage, including as not\r\nthe least of these advantages that of having public opinion on their\r\nside. It is equally understandable that Governments, for political or\r\nmilitary reasons, often endeavor to conceal their real intentions until\r\nthe decisive moment. In this matter, however, as in the conduct of war\r\nitself, there exists the basic principle, acknowledged throughout the\r\ncivilized world, that no methods may be employed which could not be\r\nemployed by men of honor even when they are opponents. One cannot,\r\nunfortunately, acquit Russia of the charge of employing improper\r\npolicies against Germany. It must, unfortunately, be said that even the\r\nCzar himself did not, at the breaking out of hostilities against\r\nGermany, show himself the gentleman upon a throne which he had formerly\r\nbeen believed by every one to be.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Emperor addressed himself to Kaiser William in moving and\r\nfriendly expressions, in which, pledging his solemn word and appealing\r\nto the grace of God, he besought the Kaiser, shortly before the outbreak\r\nof the war, to intervene at Vienna. There exists between Austria-Hungary\r\nand Germany an ancient and firm alliance, which makes it the duty of\r\nboth Governments to afford unconditional support to each other in the\r\nmoment that either one's vital interests come into question. There can\r\nbe no doubt that the existence of Austria-Hungary is threatened by the\r\nServian agitation. Despite this, the German Emperor, in offering his\r\nfinal counsels respecting the treatment of Servia and the concessions to\r\nbe made to Russia, went, in his desire for peace, almost to the point\r\nwhere Austria could have had doubts of Germany's fidelity to the\r\nobligations of the alliance. Nevertheless, Russia at this very time not\r\nonly continued its mobilization against Austria, but also simultaneously\r\nbrought its troops into a state of preparedness for war against Germany.\r\nIt is impossible that this could have been done without the order of the\r\nCzar. The conduct of the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, of the\r\nChief of the General Staff and of the War Minister was of a piece with\r\nthis attitude of the ruler. They assured the German Ambassador and the\r\nGerman Military Attaché upon their word of honor that troops were not\r\nbeing mobilized against Germany and that no attack upon Germany was\r\nplanned. The facts, however, have proved that the decision to make war\r\nupon Germany had already been reached at that time.\r\n\r\nThe reason which impelled the Czar and his chief advisers to employ such\r\nbase tactics with the help of their word of honor and appeals to the\r\nSupreme Being is plain. Russia requires a longer time for mobilization\r\nthan Germany. In order to offset this disadvantage, to deceive Germany\r\nand to win a few days' start, the Russian Government stooped to a course\r\nof conduct as to which there can be but one judgment among brave and\r\nupright opponents. No one knew better than the Czar the German Emperor's\r\nlove of peace. This love of peace was reckoned upon in the whole\r\ndespicable game. Fortunately the plan was perceived on the German side\r\nat the right time. Advices received by Germany's representative in St.\r\nPetersburg concerning the actual Russian mobilization against Germany\r\nmoved him to add to the report given him upon the Russian word of honor\r\na statement of his own conviction that an attempt was obviously being\r\nmade to deceive him. We find also that the character of the Russian\r\noperations had been rightly comprehended by so unimpeachable an organ as\r\nthe English Daily Graphic of Aug. 1, which said: \"If the mobilization\r\norder is also carried through in the provinces bordering on Germany, the\r\nwork of the preservers of peace is ended, for Germany will be compelled\r\nto answer with the mobilization of her armed forces. We confess that we\r\nare unable to understand this attitude of Russia in connection with the\r\nrenewal of the negotiations with Austria.\"\r\n\r\nIt is customary among civilized nations that a formal declaration of war\r\nshall precede the beginning of hostilities, and all powers, with the\r\nexception of some unimportant, scattered States, have obligated\r\nthemselves under international law to observe this custom. Neither\r\nRussia nor France has observed this obligation. Without a declaration of\r\nwar Russian troops crossed the German border, opened fire on German\r\ntroops, and attempted to dynamite bridges and buildings. In like manner,\r\nwithout a declaration of war, French aviators appeared above unfortified\r\ncities in South Germany and sought, by throwing bombs, to destroy the\r\nrailways. French detachments crossed the German border and occupied\r\nGerman villages. French aviators flew across neutral Holland and the\r\nthen neutral Belgium to carry out warlike plans against the lower Rhine\r\ndistrict of Germany. A considerable number of French officers, disguised\r\nin German uniforms, tried to cross the Dutch-German frontier in an\r\nautomobile in order to destroy institutions in German territory. It is\r\nplain that both France and Russia desired to compel Germany to make the\r\nfirst step in declaring war, so that the appearance of having broken the\r\npeace might, in the eyes of the world, rest upon Germany. The Russian\r\nGovernment even attempted to disseminate through a foreign news agency\r\nthe report that Germany had declared war on Russia, and it refused,\r\ncontrary to the usage among civilized nations, to permit to be\r\ntelegraphed the report of the German Ambassador that Russia had rejected\r\nthe final German note concerning war and peace.\r\n\r\nGermany for its part, in the hope that peace might yet be maintained,\r\nsubjected itself to the great disadvantage of delaying its mobilization\r\nin the first decisive days in the face of the measures of its probable\r\nenemy. When, however, the German Emperor realized that peace was no\r\nlonger possible, he declared war against France and Russia honorably,\r\nbefore the beginning of hostilities, thus bringing into contrast the\r\nmoral courage to assume the responsibility for the beginning of the\r\nconflict as against the moral cowardice of both opponents, whose fear of\r\npublic opinion was such that they did not dare openly to admit their\r\nintentions to attack Germany.\r\n\r\nGermany, moreover, cared in a humane and proper manner at the outbreak\r\nof the war for those non-combatant subjects of hostile States--traveling\r\nsalesmen, travelers for pleasure, patients in health resorts, &c.--who\r\nhappened to be in the country at the time. In isolated cases, where the\r\nexcitement of the public grew disquieting, the authorities immediately\r\nintervened to protect persons menaced. In Russia, however, in France\r\nand especially in Belgium the opposite of decency and humanity\r\nprevailed. Instead of referring feelings of national antipathy and of\r\nnational conflicting interests to the decision of the battlefield, the\r\nFrench mishandled in the most brutal manner the German population and\r\nGerman travelers in Paris and other cities, who neither could nor\r\nwished to defend themselves, and who desired solely to leave the\r\nhostile country at once. The mob threatened and mishandled Germans in\r\nthe streets, in the railway stations and in the trains, and the\r\nauthorities permitted it.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences in Belgium are infamous beyond all description. Germany\r\nwould have exposed itself to the danger of a military defeat if it had\r\nstill respected the neutrality of Belgium after it had been announced\r\nthat strong French detachments stood ready to march through that country\r\nagainst the advancing German Army. The Belgium Government was assured\r\nthat its interests would be conscientiously guarded if it would permit\r\nthe German Army to march through its territory. Its answer to this\r\nassurance was a declaration of war. In making this declaration it acted\r\nperhaps not wisely but unquestionably within its formal rights. It was,\r\nhowever, not right, but, on the contrary, a disgraceful breach of right,\r\nthat the eyes of wounded German soldiers in Belgium were gouged out, and\r\ntheir ears and noses cut off; that surgeons and persons carrying the\r\nwounded were shot at from houses.\r\n\r\nPrivate dwellings of Germans in Antwerp were plundered, German women\r\nwere dragged naked through the streets by the mob and shot to death\r\nbefore the eyes of the police and the militia. Captains of captured\r\nGerman ships in Antwerp were told that the authorities could not\r\nguarantee their lives, German tourists were robbed of their baggage,\r\ninsulted and mishandled, sick persons were driven from the German\r\nhospital, children were thrown from the windows of German homes into the\r\nstreets and their limbs were broken. Trustworthy reports of all these\r\noccurrences, from respectable and responsible men, are at hand. We\r\nperceive with the deepest indignation that the cruelties of the Congo\r\nhave been outdone by the motherland. When it comes to pass that in time\r\nof war among nations the laws of humanity respecting the helpless and\r\nthe unarmed, the women and children, are no longer observed, the world\r\nis reverting to barbarism. Even in wartimes humanity and honor should\r\nstill remain the distinguishing marks of civilization. That French and\r\nRussians, in their endeavors to spy upon Germany and destroy her\r\ninstitutions, should disguise themselves in German uniforms is a sorry\r\ntestimony to the sense of honor possessed by our opponents. He who\r\nventures to conduct espionage in a hostile land, or secretly to plant\r\nbombs, realizes that he risks the penalty of death, whether he be a\r\ncivilian or a member of the army. Up to the present, however, it has not\r\nbeen customary to use a uniform, which should be respected even by the\r\nenemy, to lessen the personal risk of the spy and to facilitate his\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years there have been increasing indications that\r\nFrance, Russia and England were systematically spying upon the military\r\ninstitutions of Germany. In the eight years from 1906 to 1913; 113\r\npersons were found guilty of attempted or accomplished espionage of a\r\ngrave nature. The methods employed by these spies included theft,\r\nattacks upon military posts and the employment of German officers'\r\nuniforms as disguises. The court proceedings threw a clear light upon\r\nthe organization and operations of espionage in Germany. This espionage\r\nwas directed from central points in foreign countries, often in the\r\nsmall neighboring neutral States. Repeatedly it appeared that the\r\nforeign embassies and consulates in Germany assisted in this work; it\r\nwas also discovered that Russia, France and England were exchanging\r\nreports which they had received concerning Germany's means of defense.\r\n\r\nThis espionage system was supported with large funds. It endeavored\r\nwhenever possible to seduce military persons and officials to betray\r\ntheir country, and, when this was not possible, it devoted its attention\r\nto doubtful characters of every sort. It began its work with petty\r\nrequests of a harmless appearance, followed these with inducements to\r\nviolations of duty, and then proceeded with threats of exposure to\r\ncompel its victims to betray their country further. Exact instructions,\r\ncomplete in the minutest detail, were given to the spies for the\r\ncarrying on of their work; they were equipped with photographic\r\napparatus, with skeleton keys, forged passes, &c.; they received fixed\r\nmonthly salaries, special bonuses for valuable information, and high\r\nrewards for especially secret matters, such as army orders, descriptions\r\nof weapons and plans of fortifications. Principal attention was paid to\r\nour boundaries, railroads, bridges and important buildings on lines of\r\ntraffic, which were spied upon by specially trained men. With the\r\nreports of these spies as their basis, our opponents have carefully\r\nplanned the destruction of the important German lines of communication.\r\nThe extraordinary watchfulness of the German military officials\r\nimmediately before the declaration of war and since then has been able\r\nto render futile the whole system of foreign attempts against our means\r\nof communication in every single instance, but a great number of such\r\nattempts have been made. All these things prove beyond doubt that a war\r\nagainst Germany has long been planned by our opponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIES ABOUT GERMANY.\r\n\r\nThe machinations of England and France to put Germany in the\r\nwrong--Lies on all sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany has now not only to battle against a world in arms, but it must\r\nalso defend itself against lies and slanders which have been piled up\r\naround it like a hostile rampart. There is no cable at our disposal.\r\nEngland has either cut the cables, or is in possession of them. No\r\nGerman description of what has actually occurred can be sent by\r\ntelegraph; the wires are carrying into the world only the distortions of\r\nour enemies. Germany is shut off as with a hedge from the outside world,\r\nand the world is supplied solely with news given out by our enemies.\r\nThis language is strictly true; for the boldest, nay, the most impudent\r\nimagination would be unable to invent anything to exceed the false and\r\nabsurd reports already printed by foreign newspapers.\r\n\r\nIn view of what we have experienced during this first week of the war we\r\ncan already calmly assert that when the editors of foreign newspapers\r\ncome later to compare their daily news of this week with the actual\r\noccurrences as testified to by authentic history, they will all open\r\ntheir eyes in astonishment and anger over all the lies which the\r\ncountries hostile to Germany have sent over the cables to bamboozle the\r\nwhole world. Much of all this has already become ridiculous; we must\r\nlaugh over it despite the solemnity of the crisis in which we are\r\nliving--for example, the bestowal of the cross of the Legion of Honor\r\nupon the city of Liége by the French President because it victoriously\r\nrepulsed the attack of the Germans. Witness, too, the telegrams of\r\ncongratulation sent by the King of England and the Czar of Russia to the\r\nBelgian King upon the victory of Liége! The joy over such \"German\r\ndefeats\" will prove just as brief as the jubilation over such \"Belgian\r\nvictories.\" Such lies have short legs, and the truth will in any case\r\nsoon overtake them.\r\n\r\nBut there are other lies of a more serious character and of more\r\ndangerous import--all such as misrepresent Germany's attitude and defame\r\nGerman character. Such defamation is designed to disturb old friendships\r\nand transform them into bitter estrangement; such defamation can also\r\nattain its hostile purpose wherever people do not say daily to\r\nthemselves, \"It is an enemy that reports such things about Germany; let\r\nus be wise and suspend our judgment till we know actual results, till we\r\nknow what is surely the truth.\"\r\n\r\nLet us select several facts as examples and as evidence--facts connected\r\nwith the preparation for this war, as well as with the conduct of it\r\nthus far.\r\n\r\nAll the cables controlled by the English-French-Russian coalition\r\ndisseminate the lie about the ostensibly \"preventive war\" that Germany\r\nwished and prepared for. The German \"White Book\" prints documents\r\nproving the white purity of the German conscience as represented by\r\nKaiser, Chancellor, and people. It reveals also the profound grief of\r\nthe German Kaiser over the sly and insidious perfidy of the Czar, toward\r\nwhom he steadily maintained German fidelity even in hours of grave\r\ndanger. What Russia did was more than a mere attack, it was a\r\ntreacherous assault. The following facts prove this:\r\n\r\n     The German mobilization was ordered on Aug. 1, whereas Russia began\r\n     to mobilize fully four weeks earlier, or about the beginning of\r\n     July. Papers found on several Russian harvest laborers arrested in\r\n     the district of Konitz show that the Russian military authorities\r\n     had already by the first of July--i.e., immediately after the\r\n     tragedy at Serajevo--sent to the leaders of these men mustering-in\r\n     orders, which were to be distributed immediately after a further\r\n     word should be given. These confiscated papers prove that Russia\r\n     hoped to be able to mobilize against Austria before Germany could\r\n     get official information of Russia's measures. The Russian\r\n     authorities purposely avoided the usual course of sending these\r\n     orders through the Russian Consuls, and they assigned \"military\r\n     exercises\" as the object of this call to the colors.\r\n\r\n     July 25--Military exercises at Krasnoye-Selo were suddenly broken\r\n     off and the troops returned at once to their garrisons. The\r\n     manoeuvres had been called off. The military cadets were advanced\r\n     at once to officers, instead of waiting, as usual, till Autumn.\r\n\r\n     July 26--All ships and boats are forbidden to sail in the waters\r\n     between Helsingfors and Yorkkele; and navigation between Sweden and\r\n     Finland is closed.\r\n\r\n     July 28--Partial mobilization; sixteen army corps to be increased\r\n     to the strength of thirty-two corps. On the same day the Czar begs\r\n     for friendly mediation; and on the same day the Russian Minister of\r\n     Foreign Affairs and the Russian Minister of War give the German\r\n     Military Attaché, upon their own initiative, their solemn word of\r\n     honor that no mobilization has taken place.\r\n\r\n     July 30--The Second and Third Russian Cavalry Divisions appear on\r\n     the German frontier between Wirballen and Augustov. The Czar issues\r\n     a ukase calling to the colors the reserves in twenty-three entire\r\n     Governments and in eighty districts of other Governments; also the\r\n     naval reserves in sixty-four districts, or twelve Russian and one\r\n     Finnish Government; also the Cossacks on furlough in a number of\r\n     districts; also the necessary reserve officers, physicians, horses\r\n     and wagons.\r\n\r\n     July 31--General mobilization of the whole Russian Army and Navy.\r\n     The German steamer Eitel Friedrich, which keeps up a regular\r\n     service between Stettin and St. Petersburg, is stopped by a Russian\r\n     torpedo boat and brought into Revel, where the crew were made\r\n     prisoners. The Russians blow up the railway bridge on Austrian\r\n     territory between Szozakowa and Granica.\r\n\r\n     Night of Aug. 1--Russian patrols attack the German railway bridge\r\n     near Eichenried and try to surprise the German railway station at\r\n     Miloslaw. A Russian column crosses the German frontier at\r\n     Schwidden, and two squadrons of Cossacks ride against Johannisburg.\r\n\r\n     Aug. 1--(At last) Germany's mobilization.\r\n\r\nAnd France?\r\n\r\n     July 27--The Fourteenth Army Corps breaks off its manoeuvres.\r\n\r\n     July 31--General mobilization.\r\n\r\n     Aug. 2--French troops attack German frontier posts, cross the\r\n     frontier, and occupy German towns. Bomb-throwing aviators come into\r\n     Baden and Bavaria; also, after violating Belgium's neutrality by\r\n     crossing Belgian territory, they enter the Rhine Province and try\r\n     to destroy bridges.\r\n\r\n     Only after all this is the German Ambassador at Paris instructed to\r\n     demand his passports.\r\n\r\nAnd England?\r\n\r\nIn London war must already have been decided upon by July 31; the\r\nEnglish Admiralty had even before that date advised Lloyd's against\r\ninsuring German ships. On the same day the German Government gave\r\nemphatic support in Vienna to the English mediatory proposal of Sir\r\nEdward Grey. But the entire English fleet had already been assembled.\r\n\r\nOf course, English public opinion was and still is divided. As late as\r\nAug. 1 The Daily Graphic wrote in reference to the Russian mobilization\r\norder: \"Will the Russian order also be carried out in the provinces on\r\nthe German frontier? If so, then the labor of the peace-preservers is at\r\nan end, for Germany is compelled to answer with the mobilization of its\r\narmed forces. We confess that we are not able to understand this\r\nattitude of Russia, in view of the resumption of negotiations at\r\nVienna.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a leaflet distributed in the streets of London said that \"a war for\r\nRussia is a war against civilization.\"\r\n\r\nSo much as to the preparations for the war--and now we take up the\r\nconduct of the war itself.\r\n\r\nBy glancing at the foreign press during this one week we have been able\r\nto collect the following specimen pieces of news:\r\n\r\n     London--The British Admiralty reports that the English fleet had\r\n     driven back the German fleet to the Dutch coast.\r\n\r\nThere is not one word of truth in this. The Admiralty itself appears\r\nlater to have recovered its senses; at least, it denied a Reuter story\r\nabout a \"great English naval victory near the Dogger Bank.\" But the\r\nEnglish manufactories of lies are already so actively at work that\r\nmembers of Parliament have protested in the House itself against the\r\n\"lying reports of the English press.\"\r\n\r\n     Paris--From Paris the assertion was made and disseminated\r\n     throughout the world that \"the landing of English troops in Belgium\r\n     has begun; they were enthusiastically received by the population.\r\n     The landing proceeded rapidly and in the best order, as the\r\n     agreement between the two General Staffs guaranteed the perfect\r\n     carrying out of the disembarkment plans.\"\r\n\r\nNot a single word of this is true. At present not one English soldier\r\nhas been landed.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way the Baltic Sea has become the scene of invented\r\n\"battles\"--of \"German defeats,\" of course; the Russian Baltic Fleet sank\r\na German war vessel in a battle that never occurred.\r\n\r\nAnd, \"The Russian vanguard has crossed the German frontier without\r\nmeeting with opposition.\" As a matter of fact there is not a single\r\nRussian soldier on German soil. All inroads have been repulsed, and the\r\nGerman offensive has everywhere been successful.\r\n\r\nA Dutch newspaper prints the following report from France:\r\n\r\n     Belfort--Many hundreds of Alsatians are joining the French Army\r\n     with great enthusiasm, also many Italian Swiss. A large number of\r\n     Alsace-Lorrainers are waiting near the frontier with a view of\r\n     crossing it at a favorable opportunity to fight on the French side.\r\n\r\nSuch absurdity in the face of the unbroken unanimity of the entire\r\nGerman people and despite the manifest enthusiasm of the\r\nAlsace-Lorrainers for the German cause!\r\n\r\nEqually stupid and made up for incurably credulous readers is an\r\nofficial report of the French War Ministry--not a private rumor, be it\r\nnoted, but an official communication. It says:\r\n\r\n     A young Frenchman reports under oath that he was arrested, along\r\n     with several other Frenchmen, at the railway station in Lörrach\r\n     while on the homeward journey from Baden; and they were led through\r\n     the whole city under a military escort. One of the Frenchmen\r\n     shouted, \"Hurrah for France,\" and was at once shot down. Three\r\n     others who protested against this suffered the same fate; and so\r\n     did a fifth man who thereupon had called the Germans murderers. The\r\n     rest of the Frenchmen, proceeding to Switzerland by rail, heard\r\n     shots fired in the adjoining compartment; they discovered that two\r\n     Italians had been shot by Germans because one had protested against\r\n     the opening of the window, and another had jostled a German.\r\n\r\nDoes such stuff call for any refutation at all?\r\n\r\nA typical example of how it is sought to work upon public opinion by\r\nmeans of systematic lying is afforded by the capture of Liége.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that this Belgian stronghold, along with its forts, which\r\ncontained a garrison of 20,000 men, was taken by storm on Aug. 7 by the\r\nGerman troops, who fought with unparalleled bravery, and that 3,000 to\r\n4,000 Belgian prisoners of war are already on their way to Germany.\r\n\r\nYet on Aug. 9--two days after the fall of Liége--a dispatch was still\r\nsent to the Dutch press, saying: \"The Liége forts are still in Belgian\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on Aug. 8, thirty-six hours after the fall of Liége--a dispatch was\r\nsent from Paris to the newspapers of Rome, saying:\r\n\r\n     The Germans lost 20,000 men at Liége and asked for an armistice of\r\n     twenty-four hours. Liége has not yet fallen. The English landed\r\n     100,000 men at Antwerp, who were received with jubilation by the\r\n     population. President Poincaré, upon the proposal of Doumergue, the\r\n     Minister of War, conferred on the City of Liége the cross of the\r\n     Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\nAnother newspaper reported as follows: \"The King of England sent a\r\ncongratulatory dispatch to the King of Belgium upon his victory at\r\nLiége; seven German regiments were slain.\"\r\n\r\nAt Paris itself a note of the French War Ministry--published on the\r\nevening of Aug. 7, Liége having fallen in the early morning of that\r\nday--mentions the resistance of Liége and says that the forts are still\r\nholding out; that the Germans who had entered the city on Thursday by\r\npassing between the forts had evacuated it on Friday; and that the\r\nBelgian division that went to the assistance of the city had therefore\r\nnot even made an attack. The official note concludes from all this that\r\nthe resistance of the Belgians was seriously disturbing the plan of the\r\nGermans, who were building hopes upon a rapid success.\r\n\r\nAnd four full days after the capture of Liége the French Minister at\r\nBerne reported officially: \"Liége has not yet been taken; the German\r\ntroops were repulsed.\"\r\n\r\nAt Copenhagen the following dispatches were published: \"The English and\r\nFrench troops had effected a junction with the Belgian Army and had\r\nentered Liége and made many German prisoners, among them a nephew of the\r\nGerman Kaiser.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly at Stockholm: \"The Germans had suffered a severe repulse.\"\r\n\r\nAgain a dispatch from Paris to Rome: \"The Germans had been driven back\r\nbehind the Moselle and were begging for an armistice; the French had\r\npassed Namur and were pressing forward in forced marches, while 500,000\r\nEnglish were falling upon the German flank.\"\r\n\r\nStill another official report from Paris: \"Liége is becoming the grave\r\nof the 150,000 Germans who are breaking their heads against its walls;\r\nthe Belgians had taken 3,000 prisoners, who were in a terrible\r\ncondition; but for their good fortune of falling into captivity they\r\nwould have starved to death.\"\r\n\r\nIn contrast to all this let us take the unvarnished truth as in the\r\nreported simple words of the German Quartermaster General:\r\n\r\n     We are now able to report upon Liége Without doing any harm.... We\r\n     had only a weak force at Liége four days ago, for it is not\r\n     possible to prepare for such a bold undertaking by collecting large\r\n     masses of men. That we attained the desired end in spite of this is\r\n     due to the excellent preparation, the valor of our troops, their\r\n     energetic leadership, and the help of God. The courage of the enemy\r\n     was broken, and his troops fought badly. The difficulties against\r\n     us lay in the exceedingly unfavorable topography of the\r\n     surroundings, which consisted of hills and woods, and in the\r\n     treacherous participation of the entire population in the fighting,\r\n     not even excluding women. The people fired upon our troops from\r\n     ambush, from villages and forests--fired upon our physicians who\r\n     were treating the wounded, and upon the wounded themselves. Hard\r\n     and bitter fighting occurred; whole villages had to be destroyed in\r\n     order to break the resistance, before our brave troops penetrated\r\n     the girdle of forts and took possession of the city. It is true\r\n     that a part of the forts still held out, but they no longer fired.\r\n     The Kaiser did not want to waste a drop of blood in storming the\r\n     forts, which no longer hindered the carrying out of our plans. We\r\n     were able to await the arrival of heavy artillery to level the\r\n     forts one after the other at our leisure, and without the sacrifice\r\n     of a single life--in case their garrisons should not surrender\r\n     sooner.... So far as can be judged at present the Belgians had more\r\n     men for the defense of the city than we had for storming it. Every\r\n     expert can measure from this fact the greatness of our achievement;\r\n     it is without a parallel....\r\n\r\n     (Signed) VON STEIN,\r\n\r\n     Quartermaster General.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not the German people alone that will have cause to remember\r\nLiége; the whole world will do well to learn from the case of Liége that\r\nan organized manufactory of lies is trying to deceive the public opinion\r\nof all the nations. Glorious victories are converted into \"defeats with\r\nheavy losses,\" and the strong moral discipline of the German troops is\r\nslanderously described in the reports of the imaginative, phrase-loving\r\nFrench as cruelty--just as in 1870 the Prussian Uhlans were described as\r\nthrusting through with their lances all the French babies and pinning\r\nthem fast to the walls.\r\n\r\nHow far the \"grande nation\" has already degenerated, and how far the\r\nBelgian population, akin to the French both in blood and in sentiments,\r\nimitate the French in their Balkan brutality, is illustrated by two\r\nexamples. One of these, in the form of a German official warning, says:\r\n\"The reports at hand about the fighting around Liége show that the\r\npopulation of the country took part in the battle. Our troops were fired\r\nupon from ambush. Physicians were shot at while following their\r\nprofession. Cruelties were practiced by the population on wounded\r\nsoldiers. There is also news at hand showing that German patrols in the\r\nvicinity of Metz were fired at from ambush from the French side. It may\r\nbe that these occurrences are due to the composition of the population\r\nin those industrial regions, but it may also be that France and Belgium\r\nare preparing for a guerrilla warfare upon our troops. If the latter\r\nalternative should prove true, and this proof be strengthened through\r\nrepetitions of these occurrences, then our opponents will have\r\nthemselves to thank if this war be carried on with unrelenting severity\r\neven against the guilty population. The German troops, who are\r\naccustomed to preserve discipline and to wage war only against the armed\r\nforces of the hostile State, cannot be blamed if, in just self-defense,\r\nthey give no quarter. The hope of influencing the result of the war by\r\nturning loose the passions of the populace will be frustrated by the\r\nunshaken energy of our leaders and our troops. Before neutral foreign\r\ncountries, however, it must be demonstrated, even at the beginning of\r\nthis war, that it was not the German troops who caused the war to take\r\non such forms.\"\r\n\r\nThe details of the cruelties, here only hinted at, on the Belgian and\r\nFrench side, are supplied and proved by an eye-witness, a German\r\nphysician, who reports:\r\n\r\n     We have experienced from the Belgian population, from men, women,\r\n     and half-grown boys, such things as we had hitherto seen only in\r\n     wars with negroes. The Belgian civilian population shoots in blind\r\n     hatred from every house, from every thick bush, at everything that\r\n     is German. We had on the very first day many dead and wounded,\r\n     caused by the civilian population. Women take part as well as men.\r\n     One German had his throat cut at night while in bed. Five wounded\r\n     Germans were put into a house bearing the flag of the Red Cross; by\r\n     the next morning they had all been stabbed to death. In a village\r\n     near Verviers we found the body of one of our soldiers with his\r\n     hands bound behind his back and his eyes punched out. An automobile\r\n     column which set out from Liége halted in a village; a young woman\r\n     came up, suddenly drew a revolver, and shot a chauffeur dead. At\r\n     Emmenich, an hour by foot from Aachen, a sanitary automobile column\r\n     was attacked by the populace on a large scale and fired at from the\r\n     houses. The red cross on our sleeves and on our automobiles gives\r\n     us physicians no protection at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY AND THE FOREIGNER.\r\n\r\nRespect for the foreigner--Russians willing to remain in\r\nGermany--Ill-treatment of Germans in Belgium and France.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnemies on all sides! With dishonorable weapons against us, and with\r\ndocumentary lies for the rest of the world! Let us calmly allow them to\r\ncontinue lying and slandering as they have begun--it will result finally\r\nin injuring themselves. The world will very soon see through this\r\nimpudent, unabashed game; and it will finally side with the people which\r\nkeeps to the truth, Only the weakling lies and swindles; the strong man\r\nloves and honors truth. Let us act like the strong man in this struggle!\r\n\r\nRespect for the foreigner, protection for his person and property have\r\nat all times been considered sacred among civilized people. Germany can\r\nwithout exaggeration claim to have upheld this respect and this\r\nprotection in these fateful days. Except for a few insignificant\r\nincidents which took place in several large cities, where the natural\r\nexcitement of the people and the legitimate defense against an insolent\r\nsystem of spying led to the molesting and arrest of foreigners--mostly\r\nRussians--the measures taken against the citizens of hostile nations did\r\nnot exceed what was absolutely necessary to the safety of the country.\r\nThe Imperial Government and likewise the Federated States have refrained\r\nfrom expelling \"en masse\" Frenchmen, Russians, Belgians and Englishmen.\r\nIt was, of course, unavoidable to take measures for the detention of\r\nsuch persons as seemed suspicious and for the internation of strangers\r\nliable to be called to take arms against Germany. This took place in\r\ncities, e.g., Berlin, where these men were taken away as \"prisoners of\r\nwar,\" as soon as the \"state of war\" had been proclaimed, and placed in\r\nspecial rooms or camps. Lodgings and food are such as seem requisite and\r\nthe treatment of these prisoners is according to their own opinion very\r\nkind. The Russian agricultural laborers constitute a special group of\r\nforeigners in Germany: There are about 40,000 to 50,000 of them, men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nFrom various parts of the country it is unanimously announced that these\r\npeople are very glad not to be obliged to return to Russia. They are\r\nglad to remain in Germany, and willingly continue their work of\r\ngathering the rich German grain, potato and hay crops. Should there be\r\nany difficulties, these workmen would also have to be internated. No\r\nmeasures at all have been taken against women and children belonging to\r\nhostile States. They are left free to move about as they wish. Should\r\nthey remain in Germany they can be sure that they will be subject to no\r\nother inconvenience except such as the general state of war inflicts\r\nupon Germans. The authorities will protect their persons, and their\r\nprivate property is respected. Nobody will touch it--as nobody has\r\ntouched it so far.\r\n\r\nIf the German people and the German Government consider the respect they\r\nowe the foreigner as a sacred law, even though the foreigner belongs to\r\nthe enemy, this respect is enhanced by affection and gratitude in the\r\ncase of foreigners whose countries are friendly or neutral.\r\nThousands and thousands of Americans, Swiss, Dutch, Italians and\r\nScandinavians are still living in German countries. They may be sure\r\nthat they can live as freely here as any German citizen. Should it be\r\npossible for them to return home, the best wishes will accompany them.\r\nThe property they leave here will be protected. This is guaranteed by\r\nthe authorities and by influential private persons. Should they stay in\r\nGermany, however, the German people will express their sense of\r\ngratitude for any friendly help they may lend, by increased respect and\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA strong contrast is noticeable between Germany's attitude toward\r\nforeigners and the facts revealed just now as to the treatment meted out\r\nin inimical countries not only to Germans but to other foreigners.\r\nTruly, in England there has been some effort to act according to the\r\nusages of civilized nations when engaged in warfare. Germans and\r\nAustrians have been insulted and molested; there has been some\r\noccasional destruction of property in stores; but as far as can be\r\njudged these were excesses of an uncontrollable mob. A general expulsion\r\nhas not been ordered, and it is to be hoped that the Germans living in\r\nthe United Kingdom and in its colonies will not suffer too heavy\r\ndamages, in person or in property. Russia, France and Belgium, on the\r\nother hand, have by the ill-treatment and plundering of foreigners\r\nliving in their countries struck themselves out of the list of civilized\r\nnations. Innumerable reports from expelled or fugitive people prove\r\nthis, and official reports confirm them. Also the press of neutral,\r\nneighboring countries, such as Switzerland, Holland, and Italy, is full\r\nof similar complaints. Owing to the scarcity of news from Russia, the\r\nfacts known so far only concern Petersburg, where German and Austrian\r\nmen and women, residents or transients, were beaten and stoned in the\r\nstreets. Here were also some cruel mutilations and murders. The\r\nbeautiful building of the German Embassy in Petersburg was attacked by\r\nthe mob. And the police watched all these misdeeds with crossed arms or\r\neven assisted. Probably what took place in Petersburg also occurred in\r\nother Russian cities; we shall soon know.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many complaints against the French and the Belgians.\r\nOn the evening of Aug. 1 the mobilization was announced, and the next\r\nmorning the official order was posted on the walls, that within\r\ntwenty-four hours from the beginning of that day all Germans and\r\nAustrians, irrespective of sex, age or profession, would have to leave\r\nFrance. Those who remained and could not reach the boundary would be\r\ntaken to the southwestern part of the country and imprisoned. There were\r\nfew trains for Belgium or Switzerland. Thousands and thousands who had\r\nto abandon their property rushed to the stations with wife and children,\r\nfought for room in the overcrowded trains, surrounded by a howling mob,\r\nand even then were punched and slapped by policemen. During the trip\r\nthere was nothing but misery. Men and women fell ill, children died. The\r\nrefugees had to cross the Belgian boundary, walking a distance of six or\r\nseven kilometers in the middle of the night, dead tired, their luggage\r\nstolen--sometimes, it is said, by officials. In Belgium the same tragedy\r\noccurred as in France. And then came the salvation. The cordial,\r\nhospitable reception by the Germans in Holland and Switzerland is\r\nunanimously praised and appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe reports of brutal acts from Paris, Antwerp, Brussels, would be\r\nincredible were they not confirmed hundredfold. The most brutal and\r\ninsulting threats of death were flung by processions of people going\r\nthrough the streets to all those who looked like foreigners. They were\r\nseverely ill-treated. Houses and stores were upset, furniture and the\r\nlike were thrown into the streets, employers and working people were\r\ndragged out, women were stripped and pushed through the streets,\r\nchildren were thrown out of windows. Knives, swords, sticks and\r\nrevolvers were used. One could fill books with the details, but they are\r\nall equally cruel. Not only Germans and Austrians were expelled\r\nand ill-treated, but citizens of neutral States shared this awful lot.\r\nThousands of Italians were expelled, as well as numerous Rumanians. The\r\npress in both countries complains bitterly and asks what has become of\r\nthose who remained in France and were imprisoned in the south--but\r\nnobody knows.\r\n\r\nHistory will place this ill-treatment and oppression of foreigners on\r\nrecord. The responsibility rests, not with an uncontrollable mob, but\r\nwith the Government and the authorities of the two countries who have\r\nalways boasted of their culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE AND TRADE RELATIONS\r\nBETWEEN GERMANY AND UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nGermany's financial rise since 1870--Export and import with the United\r\nStates of America--The present firm condition of German finance.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoliticians and commercial men must base their plans upon facts, as they\r\nare and not as they wish they were, otherwise they fail. France has\r\nclosed its eyes not only to the great intellectual and moral assists of\r\nGermany but also to its commercial resources.\r\n\r\nFrance has repeatedly declared that Germany could not effect a serious\r\npolitical opposition, because a war would result in the ruin of its\r\ncommercial and financial strength. This we heard in the Morocco crisis,\r\nalso in the Balkan wars. Germany's love of peace which was tested in the\r\nabove-mentioned cases strengthened the French in their error. He,\r\nhowever, who has taken the trouble to visit Germany and the Germans in\r\ntheir places of employment--and especially Americans in recent years\r\nhave done this, however, also many Englishmen, who in vain have\r\nprotested against the war with Germany--he can testify to the\r\nastonishing commercial advancement which Germany has made since its\r\npolitical union by Bismarck.\r\n\r\nA few facts and statistics may recall this to memory. The population of\r\nGermany has since 1870, immigrants excluded, increased from 40,000,000\r\nto 67,000,000, round numbers. Incomes and wages in particular have\r\napproximately doubled during the last generation; savings deposits have\r\nincreased sixfold. Although, only a generation ago, commerce and trade\r\nemployed only about two-fifths of the population, now more than\r\nthree-fifths are engaged in this field of work, and Germany, as a result\r\nof its agricultural economy and increased intense farming, is today the\r\nthird largest agricultural country of the world. In the coal and iron\r\nindustries Germany is second only to America. In one generation its coal\r\nproduction increased two and a half fold, its raw iron production almost\r\nfourfold. During the same period of time the capital of the German banks\r\nincreased fourfold and their reserve fund eightfold. Characteristic of\r\nGermany is the fact that hand in hand with this active private\r\ninitiative is a strong feeling for the great universal interests and for\r\norganic co-operation of private and State resources. This feeling\r\nexplains the perfect working of our State activities, in particular our\r\nrailways, 95 per cent. of which are owned by the Government and which\r\nyield an essentially higher revenue than those in England or France; it\r\nexplains further the willing assumption of the great financial burdens\r\nwhich general insurance imposes upon those engaged in private\r\nenterprises and which today is proving a blessing to almost the entire\r\nlaboring force of Germany, to an extent which has not yet been realized\r\nby any other country.\r\n\r\nWhat economic value to the world has a nation which for more than forty\r\nyears has concentrated all its energy in peaceful industry? Does any one\r\ndeny that Germany's great technical and commercial advancement has been\r\na blessing in respect to the development of the world? Has not the\r\ncommercial advancement in Germany had the effect of awakening new\r\nproductive powers in all parts of the world and of adding new\r\nterritories which engage in the exchange of goods with the civilized\r\nnations of the world? Since the founding of the new German\r\nEmpire, German foreign trade has increased from 5-1/2 to approximately\r\n20 billion marks. Germany has become the best customer of a great number\r\nof countries. Not only has the German consumption of provisions and\r\nluxuries increased in an unusual degree, also that of meat, tropical\r\nfruits, sugar, tobacco and colonial products, but above all else that of\r\nraw materials, such as coal, iron, copper and other metals, cotton,\r\npetroleum, wood, skins, &c. Germany furnishes a market for articles of\r\nmanufacture also, for American machinery, English wool, French luxury\r\narticles, &c. One is absolutely wrong in the belief that the competition\r\nof German industry in the world market has been detrimental to other\r\ncommercial nations. Legitimate competition increases the business of all\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America has reaped especial profit from Germany's\r\nflourishing commercial condition. Germany purchases more from the United\r\nStates of America than from any other country of the world. Germany buys\r\nannually from the United States of America approximately $170,000,000\r\nworth of cotton, $75,000,000 worth of copper, $60,000,000 worth of\r\nwheat, $40,000,000 animal fat, $20,000,000 mineral oil and the same\r\namount of vegetable oil. In 1890 the import and export trade between\r\nGermany and the United States amounted to only $100,000,000, in 1913 to\r\nabout $610,000,000. Germany today imports from the United States goods\r\nto the value of $430,000,000, while she exports to the United States\r\nnearly $180,000,000 worth. No nation therefore can judge as well as the\r\nUnited States what German commerce means to the world.\r\n\r\nIn what condition are the finances of Germany? In this field our\r\nopponents will be obliged to change their views. In 1912 Germany's\r\nnational debt was about 14 marks per capita lower than England's. The\r\npublic debt of France per capita was far more than double that of\r\nGermany. Germany, however, has large national assets which offset its\r\nliabilities. For example, the stocks of the Prussian railways alone\r\nexceed by far the aggregate amount of the Prussian debt, the income of\r\nthe railways alone is essentially greater than the amount which the\r\ninterest and amortization of the entire State debt demand. The war,\r\nwhich, according to the French conception, was destined to bring about\r\nthe financial and commercial ruin of Germany, has brought forth the\r\nastonishing result that the famous French money market was the first to\r\nfail in this crisis. As early as July 25, before the rejection of the\r\nAustrian ultimatum by Servia had been made known, the offer of 3 per\r\ncent. redeemable French notes to the French Exchange was so great that\r\nthe Chambre Syndicale des Agents de Change in the interest of the public\r\nprohibited the quotation of a lower rate than 78 per cent., while bids\r\nof 74 per cent. had already been submitted. Sale in blank was absolutely\r\nforbidden, and in the coulisse business was at a standstill. A few days\r\nlater the July liquidation, in the official market as well as in the\r\ncoulisse, was postponed until the end of August, which action proved the\r\nnecessity of a period of grace. On July 31 the French savings banks, at\r\nthe command of the Government, suspended daily payments and paid out\r\nsums to the amount of 50 francs, fourteen days' notice being necessary.\r\nThe London money market, too, has hardly stood the war test. On July 30\r\nthe Bank of England was obliged to raise its rate of discount from 3 to\r\n4 per cent., several days later to 8 per cent., and again after a few\r\ndays to the incredible rate of 10 per cent. In contrast to this the\r\nPresident of the German Reichsbank was able, on the 1st of August, to\r\ndeclare that the directorate, because of the strength of the Reichsbank\r\nand the solid constitution of the German money market, did not consider\r\nit necessary to follow England's example. The German Reichsbank has\r\ntherefore not exceeded the rate of 6 per cent. Worse yet was the fact\r\nthat England, on Aug. 2, was obliged to require grace on exchange, and\r\nFrance, on Aug. 3, grace on its accounts-current and Lombard loans.\r\nAlthough along with England and France, also Russia, Austria, Italy,\r\nBelgium, and other nations required temporary credit, Germany\r\nto date has not deemed it necessary to ask for time in meeting its\r\nobligations. Savings banks, other banks and financial institutions are\r\nmeeting all demands without restriction. The fact that the English money\r\nmarket, which up to the present time has been considered the financial\r\ncentre of international trade, has failed, will bring many a serious\r\nthought to all commercial men interested in the world market.\r\n\r\nGerman commerce has doubtless been temporarily injured by the war, but\r\nthe esprit de corps and organization which animate the German Nation are\r\nnot only a firm foundation for German commerce, but also a strong\r\nsupport for the further development of the commerce and trade of the\r\nentire civilized world, if, as we hope, peace soon be re-established.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO IS TO BE VICTORIOUS?\r\n\r\nAn appeal to American friends\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American citizen who is now leaving Europe, which has been turned\r\ninto an enormous military camp, may consider himself fortunate that he\r\nwill soon be able to set foot in the New World, where he will be enabled\r\nagain to take up his business pursuits. In the meantime old Europe is\r\nbeing torn asunder by a terrible war among its various peoples. It will\r\nmake him happy again to greet mountain and valley, field and garden\r\nwhich are not threatened nor trampled down by armies or covered with\r\nblood; again to see cities in which business and traffic are not brought\r\nto a standstill by calling in all men capable of military service; and\r\nhe may thank fortune that his people have been given room enough in\r\nwhich to expand and to permit them freely to unfold their power; that\r\nthey are spared the great necessity of resisting the tightening ring of\r\nenemies in the east and west, on land and water, in a struggle for\r\nnational existence.\r\n\r\nBut the American will feel the effects of the fate of the Old World.\r\nEven though he knows his own country is not directly involved, he will\r\ncertainly realize that the great net of international traffic and the\r\nprogress of his country are connected by many strong ties to the life\r\nand prosperity of European peoples. He will be affected by every victory\r\nand defeat, just as by the sun and rain in his own country. He will\r\ndoubtless remember that of all European countries Germany is the best\r\ncustomer of the United States, from which she purchases yearly over\r\n1,000,000,000 marks in cotton, food, metal, and technical products. If\r\nGermany is economically ruined, which is the wish of Russia, France, and\r\nEngland and all allied friends of wretched Servia, it would mean the\r\nloss of a heavy buyer to America, and thereby cause a serious loss to\r\nAmerica which could not easily be made good. It would be a great blow to\r\nAmerican export trade, of which Germany handles not less than 14 per\r\ncent. yearly.\r\n\r\nThe material loss is not the only feature. In the economic struggle in\r\nthe world markets American and German commercial men have learned\r\nmutually to appreciate one another, to appreciate one another more\r\nhighly than do any other two rivals. The time is long past when the\r\nAmerican pictured the German as one of thousands, shut up in a room,\r\nsurrounded by documents and parchments, speculating about the unknown\r\noutside world, and the same is true of the German's idea of the\r\nAmerican--a money-hungry barbarian. Two nations in which so much kindred\r\nblood flows and which are connected by so many historical events\r\nunderstand each other better today than formerly. Above all, they have a\r\nmutual understanding regarding the ideal in commercial life: A man\r\nengaged in work not for the sake of the profit, but for the sake of the\r\nwork he is doing; one who gives all his strength to his task, and who\r\nworks for the general welfare of the people as a whole, considering his\r\nposition as an office and his wealth as an obligation, not as the final\r\naim, but as a basis for the realization of higher attainments. He places\r\nthe value of character and the development of the creative powers of man\r\nhigher than all economic success. Two nations united by such common\r\ninclinations [pg 272] and ideals, boldness of enterprise,\r\nfar-sightedness, quickness of decision, and admiration for intellectual\r\nachievements, cannot help being exceedingly congenial to each other.\r\nWhat concerns one today concerns the other.\r\n\r\nDoes it sound like a paradox when I say Germany's struggle concerns not\r\nonly her own destiny, but to a considerable extent that of America? Does\r\nthe United States consider itself entirely immune from the warlike\r\ncomplications brought about by the Servian murder of Princes and\r\nRussia's breach of faith? In any event, it will be difficult for it to\r\nsay: \"What's Hecuba to me?\" One thing should be clearly understood on\r\nthe shores of the five oceans, that the cause of this most terrible war\r\ndoes not emanate from the dark Balkans, or from a Russian military\r\ngroup, but from envy and hate which healthy, young and striving Germany\r\nhas aroused in her older rivals; not because this or that demand was\r\nmade by one Cabinet and refused by another, but because it was believed\r\nthere was finally an opportunity to destroy the hated opponent who\r\nthreatened to put the older Western European powers in the shade, and\r\nfor this reason England and France put their strength into the service\r\nof criminal and brutal Servia. The following statistics will, perhaps,\r\nthrow some light on the development of the foreign trade of the\r\nprincipal countries from 1870 to 1913 (in billions of marks):\r\n\r\n                   1870.     1913.\r\nGreat Britain     9,180    23,280\r\nFrance            4,540    12,300\r\nRussia            2,000     5,580\r\nGermany           4,240    20,440\r\n\r\nIn these forty-three years, which have been decisive in the development\r\nof international economy, England, France and Russia have not been able\r\neven to increase their foreign trade three times, while Germany and the\r\nUnited States have increased theirs five times. The trade of Germany and\r\nthe United States has increased from 7.6 to 38 billion marks. If these\r\nfigures show nothing else, they show on which side the American sympathy\r\nwill be. This war, provoked by Russia because of an outrageous desire\r\nfor revenge, supported by England and France, has no other motive than\r\nenvy of Germany's position in economic life, and of her people, who are\r\nfighting for a place in the sun. \"Right or wrong, Germany must not\r\ngrow.\" That is the turning point of a policy which the French Republic\r\ndrilled into the Muscovites. Let us consider the adversaries of Germany.\r\nRussia, the classic land of power and terrible exploitation of the\r\npeople for the benefit of a degenerated aristocracy. France, a type of a\r\nnation in which there is not even enough enterprise to increase the\r\nproductiveness of the country. England, which has so long felt its glory\r\nvanishing and in the meantime has remained far behind its younger rival\r\nin financial and economic equipment. One can easily imagine the feelings\r\nof these peoples when they observe the rapid and successful growth of\r\nGermany, and wonders if these same feelings will not one day be directed\r\nagainst the youthful North American giant. In this war it shall be\r\ndecided which is the stronger--the organized inertia of the tired and\r\nenvious, or the unfolding of power in the service of a strong and\r\nsacrificing life. To know that we have American friendship in this\r\nstruggle will mean a great moral support for us in the coming trying\r\ndays, for we know that the country of George Washington and Abraham\r\nLincoln places itself only on the side of a just cause and one worthy of\r\nhumanity's blessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOODROW WILSON,\r\nPresident of the United States of America.\r\n(_Photo (C) by Bradley Studio._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeculations About Peace, September, 1914\r\n\r\nReport by James W. Gerard, American Ambassador at Berlin, to\r\nPresident Wilson.\r\n\r\nBy The Associated Press.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Sept. 17.--Germany has suggested informally that the United\r\nStates should undertake to elicit from Great Britain, France, and Russia\r\na statement of the terms under which the Allies would make peace.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was made by the Imperial Chancellor, von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg, to Ambassador Gerard at Berlin as a result of an\r\ninquiry sent by the American Government to learn whether Emperor William\r\nwas desirous of discussing peace, as recently had been reported.\r\n\r\nNo reply was made by Emperor William himself, nor did the Imperial\r\nChancellor indicate whether or not he spoke on behalf of the Emperor.\r\nAmbassador Gerard, in a cable dispatch to President Wilson, repeated the\r\nChancellor's remarks from recollection, substantially as follows:\r\n\r\n     Germany was appreciative of the American Government's interest and\r\n     offer of services in trying to make peace. Germany did not want\r\n     war, but had it forced on her. Even if she defeats France, she must\r\n     likewise vanquish both Great Britain and Russia, as all three have\r\n     made an agreement not to make peace except by common consent.\r\n     Similarly, England has announced through Premier Asquith and her\r\n     diplomatists and the newspapers that she intends to fight to the\r\n     limit of her endurance. In view of that determination on the part\r\n     of Great Britain, the United States ought to get proposals of peace\r\n     from the Allies. Germany could accept only a lasting peace, one\r\n     that would make her people secure against future attacks. To accept\r\n     mediation now would be interpreted by the Allies as a sign of\r\n     weakness on the part of Germany and would be misunderstood by the\r\n     German people, who, having made great sacrifices, had the right to\r\n     demand guarantees of security.\r\n\r\nThe above is all that Ambassador Gerard communicated as to his\r\nconversation. He added only the brief comment that he, himself, thought\r\nthe way might possibly be opened to mediation. President Wilson did not\r\nregard the message, however, as bringing anything tangible. He referred\r\nto the Chancellor's conversation as non-committal and incidental to the\r\nacknowledgment of the American Government's inquiry. The President\r\nindicated that he rather expected a reply to the inquiry to be sent\r\neventually from the Emperor himself, although he realizes that the\r\nImperial Chancellor may have consulted the Kaiser by telegraph before\r\ntalking informally with the American Ambassador.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson took no action as a result of the message, waiting to\r\nhear from Ambassador Gerard whether anything of a more formal character\r\ncould be obtained by him which the United States might communicate to\r\nGreat Britain, France, and Russia. It was understood tonight that the\r\nBritish and French Ambassadors who are in Washington were not informed\r\nofficially or unofficially by Secretary Bryan of the conversation\r\nbetween the Imperial German Chancellor and Ambassador Gerard.\r\n\r\nGermany's position is that she will give her opinion on terms of peace\r\nwhen she has received a definite statement from the Allies of their\r\nproposals. The statement that Germany did not want war, but had it\r\nforced upon her, as well as the declaration that she wanted a lasting\r\npeace, is almost identical with the remarks which Sir Edward Grey made\r\nto Ambassador Page in London last week. The British Foreign Secretary\r\nsaid England wanted no temporary truce, but a permanent peace, and one\r\nthat would safeguard her against sudden attacks such as Germany had\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident's Future Course.\r\n\r\nThe general belief in well-informed circles tonight was that the\r\nPresident, after waiting a few days for more information from\r\nBerlin, probably would instruct the American Ambassadors at London,\r\nParis, and Petrograd to communicate what the Imperial German Chancellor\r\nhad said to Ambassador Gerard. It was believed the Ambassadors would be\r\nasked to reiterate the wish of the American Government to be of service\r\nin bringing about peace and to point out the readiness of the United\r\nStates to communicate to Germany and Austria any statement of terms\r\nwhich the Allies might care to make.\r\n\r\nDiplomatists are disposed to believe that through such informal\r\nconversations something definite in the way of peace terms may yet be\r\nobtained as a working basis. If a concord of opinion for the discussion\r\nof peace terms were reached President Wilson then would endeavor to\r\nobtain an acceptance by all the belligerents of the original tender of\r\ngood offices. This would not mean a cessation of hostilities, unless the\r\nmediating power specifically made it a condition of mediation and all\r\nthe belligerents agreed to it. An armistice would not hinder military\r\nmovements or preparations, serving merely as a truce while peace was\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson already has indicated that he believes that the final\r\nreckoning of the war should be made in a conference of the European\r\npowers, and it would be the function of the United States to preside at\r\nsuch a conference if its services as a mediator were accepted.\r\n\r\nVarious reports were current today that Germany had named several\r\nconditions under which she would make peace, that she had refused\r\nproposals to alter the territorial status of her empire and possessions,\r\nand would cede no territory or dismantle her fleet, but it was said\r\nauthoritatively that nothing of this character was contained in any of\r\nthe messages from Berlin to the American Government.\r\n\r\nA statement made at the White House today was the first authoritative\r\nacknowledgment that any inquiry on the subject of Germany's attitude\r\nconcerning peace had been made by the United States. Officials\r\nheretofore have maintained silence in regard to the effort made by the\r\nGovernment to get at the bottom of the expression in favor of peace\r\nreported to have been made by the German Emperor to the Imperial\r\nChancellor and mentioned in a private conversation in New York by Count\r\nvon Bernstorff, the German Ambassador to the United States.\r\n\r\nWhat was said by Count von Bernstorff in that conversation brought Oscar\r\nS. Straus post-haste to Washington, and as a result of what he told\r\nSecretary Bryan instructions were sent to Ambassador Gerard to ascertain\r\nwhether the remarks attributed to the Emperor were to be taken as an\r\nindication that the German Government would not be averse to the\r\nexercise of the good offices of the United States in an effort to end\r\nthe hostilities in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe conversation at which the German Ambassador made the statement\r\noccurred at the house of James Speyer, the banker, in New York. Oscar S.\r\nStraus, a member of the Permanent Tribunal of Arbitration at The Hague,\r\nwas present. In the course of a discussion of the war in Europe and the\r\nprospects of peace Count von Bernstorff, it is understood, said that,\r\nwhile he had no advices from the Imperial Government since he had left\r\nBerlin, he recalled that the Imperial Chancellor had told him that he\r\nbelieved Emperor William would be willing to discuss a proposal of peace\r\nthrough mediation.\r\n\r\nWith the permission of Count von Bernstorff, Mr. Straus came to\r\nWashington and told Secretary Bryan of what the German Ambassador had\r\nsaid. On the following day Count von Bernstorff made a trip from New\r\nYork to Washington and had an interview with Secretary Bryan.\r\n\r\nIt has been understood that Mr. Bryan, in an excess of caution, desired\r\nto ask Count von Bernstorff personally if he would consent to having\r\nAmbassador Gerard instructed to make inquiry of the German\r\nGovernment as to whether the conversation between the Emperor and the\r\nImperial Chancellor might be regarded as indicating that an offer of\r\nmediation of the United States would not be unwelcome to Germany. Count\r\nvon Bernstorff is understood to have assented to Mr. Bryan's suggestion,\r\nand the instructions to Mr. Gerard followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO BEGAN THE WAR, AND WHY?\r\n\r\nCASE FOR THE TRIPLE ENTENTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST WARNINGS OF EUROPE'S PERIL.\r\n\r\nSpeeches by British Ministers.\r\n\r\nSir John Simon, British Attorney General, in Speech Before\r\nAltrincham Liberals, at Manchester, July 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been so filled with our own political development that some of\r\nus may not have noticed how serious a situation is threatening on the\r\nContinent of Europe. All I will say about it this afternoon is this--if\r\ntimes of anxiety are coming into relationships between different\r\nEuropean powers, we in this country, and I think not only Liberals among\r\nus, have reason to be glad that our foreign administration is in the\r\ncalm, cool hands of Sir Edward Grey.[06] [Cheers.] And let us all\r\nresolve that, whatever may be the difficulties and dangers which\r\nthreaten the peaceful relations in Europe, the part which this country\r\nplays shall from beginning to end be the part of a mediator simply\r\ndesirous of promoting better and more peaceful relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[06] On the next day, July 26, Earl Grey addressed to The\r\n      London Times the following appeal for national unity:\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of The Times_:\r\n\r\n     Sir: The Lord Chancellor, in his speech on Friday, called on every\r\n     Liberal to work for the peace of Europe, but to go forward\r\n     unflinchingly to civil war at home.\r\n\r\n     It is obvious that the only hope of England's effective mediation\r\n     lies in the unity and solidarity of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n     Is it not time that the common sense of the nation asserted itself\r\n     and called upon our rulers to take steps which will enable a united\r\n     nation to confront with confidence the perils which encompass us?\r\n\r\n     In moments of national peril every loyal citizen should not\r\n     hesitate, however painful the process may be, to burst the fetters\r\n     of party allegiance in order that he may devote his whole energies\r\n     to an endeavor to safeguard the higher interests of the State.\r\n\r\n     What is the cause which is dividing a so-called United Kingdom into\r\n     two hostile camps? It is the endeavor of a tyrannical House of\r\n     Commons to force upon the acceptance of the people a bill which in\r\n     the common belief they not only do not want but are strongly\r\n     opposed to. I approach the consideration of the national crisis\r\n     from no party standpoint, but from that of one who believes that\r\n     the peace of Ireland, the honor of England, and the strength of the\r\n     empire are all concerned in a speedy and satisfactory settlement of\r\n     the Irish question.\r\n\r\n     I believe that such a settlement is to be found in a measure which\r\n     will give to the peoples of Ireland powers of local self-government\r\n     similar to those enjoyed by the Provinces of Canada and South\r\n     Africa.\r\n\r\n     It is because the Ministerial policy of home rule is based on a\r\n     principle which would not be tolerated in any one of the\r\n     Legislatures of Washington, Ottawa, or Melbourne that I am so\r\n     strongly opposed to it. No party, no political group, however\r\n     small, could be found in Canada, Australia, or the United States\r\n     which would venture to propose that the Province of Quebec, or the\r\n     State of Queensland or California, should be endowed by means of a\r\n     measure like the Home Rule bill with separatist constitutional\r\n     rights which could not be given to the other provinces and States.\r\n\r\n     I challenge his Majesty's Ministers to deny this plain,\r\n     unanswerable statement.\r\n\r\n     I further challenge his Majesty's Ministers to deny that their home\r\n     rule policy, if carried into effect, will make slaves of one part\r\n     of Ireland or another.\r\n\r\n     If their bill for the better government of Ireland reaches the\r\n     statute book without the amending bill it will make slaves of the\r\n     Ulstermen. It will deprive them of half of the representation to\r\n     which their population entitles them in the House of Commons, thus\r\n     reducing them to a political inferiority, as compared with the\r\n     peoples of Great Britain, which can hardly be distinguished from\r\n     political slavery, and it will further compel them to accept the\r\n     administration of a Dublin Parliament which they fear and detest in\r\n     all matters relating to their local government. I have often\r\n     wondered how any one rejoicing in the inheritance of old Liberal\r\n     traditions could for a moment suppose that any group of free men\r\n     would ever accept such dishonoring conditions.\r\n\r\n     Again, if the Home Rule bill is passed with the amending bill\r\n     tacked on to it, the chains of slavery from which Ulster will be\r\n     relieved will be riveted on the rest of Ireland. Ulster will have\r\n     thirty-three representatives in the Imperial House of Commons, and\r\n     the rest of Ireland twenty-seven! What germ of a settlement of the\r\n     Irish question can any one discover in a policy which proposes that\r\n     one-fourth of the people of Ireland should be able to outvote the\r\n     other three-fourths in matters affecting their liberties and\r\n     taxation?\r\n\r\n     No! The Ministerial bills of home rule are fundamentally bad and\r\n     should be withdrawn, in order that a new attempt may be made to\r\n     reach a settlement by general consent in accordance, as I believe,\r\n     with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the people.\r\n\r\n     Is it not better to wait a little for a settlement by consent on\r\n     lines which will conduce to permanent peace and prosperity than to\r\n     try to force on the pages of the statute book a measure which must\r\n     lead to bloodshed and civil war? If party considerations veto the\r\n     withdrawal of the Ministerial measure of home rule without the aid\r\n     of a general election, then let us have a general election without\r\n     one moment's unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\n     The times are too perilous to allow us even to contemplate with any\r\n     other feeling than that of horror and dismay the Lord Chancellor's\r\n     appeal to go forward unflinchingly to civil war.\r\n\r\n     I have the honor to remain, Sir,\r\n\r\n     Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n     GREY.\r\n\r\n     22 South Street, Park Lane, July 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A CLOUD OVER EUROPE.\"\r\n\r\nLondon Times Report, July 27, of Speech by Under Secretary\r\nAcland.\r\n\r\n\r\nF.D. Acland, Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, speaking at an\r\nopen-air Liberal demonstration at Steyning, Sussex, on Saturday [July\r\n25], said there was a cloud over Europe, the position there being far\r\ngraver and more serious than the position in Ireland. No one could\r\nimagine the disasters which a war in which a great European power was\r\ninvolved might bring to the whole world. He hoped the power of\r\naccommodating the difficulties in the same way as in the Balkan trouble\r\nlast year would be found effective. The whole of the influence of this\r\ncountry would be used in the interests of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR EDWARD GREY,\r\nBritish Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\r\n(_Photo from Underwood & Underwood._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRO-SERVIAN CRISIS.\r\n\r\nStatement in House of Commons, July 27, by Sir Edward Grey, Secretary\r\nof State for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House will, of course, be aware from the public press of what the\r\nnature of the situation in Europe is at the present moment. I think it\r\nis due to the House that I should give in short narrative form the\r\nposition which his Majesty's Government have so far taken up. [\"Hear,\r\nhear.\"] Last Friday morning I received from the Austro-Hungarian\r\nAmbassador the text of the communication made by the Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment to the powers, which has appeared in the press, and which\r\nincluded textually the demand made by the Austro-Hungarian Government\r\nupon Servia.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I saw other Ambassadors, and expressed the view that as\r\nlong as the dispute was one between Austria-Hungary and Servia alone I\r\nfelt that we had no title to interfere, but that if the relations\r\nbetween Austria-Hungary and Russia became threatening, the question\r\nwould then be one of the peace of Europe--a matter that concerned us\r\nall.\r\n\r\nI did not then know what view the Russian Government had taken\r\nof the situation, and without knowing how things were likely to develop\r\nI could not make any immediate proposition; but I said that if relations\r\nbetween Austria-Hungary and Russia did become threatening, the only\r\nchance of peace appeared to me to be that the four powers--Germany,\r\nFrance, Italy, and Great Britain--who were not directly interested in\r\nthe Servian question, should work together both in St. Petersburg and\r\nVienna simultaneously to get both Austria-Hungary and Russia to suspend\r\nmilitary operations while the four powers endeavored to arrange a\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nAfter I had heard that Austria-Hungary had broken off diplomatic\r\nrelations with Servia I made, by telegraph yesterday afternoon, the\r\nfollowing proposal, as a practical method of applying the views that I\r\nhad already expressed:\r\n\r\nI instructed his Majesty's Ambassadors in Paris, Berlin, and Rome to ask\r\nthe Governments to which they were accredited whether they would be\r\nwilling to arrange that the French, German, and Italian Ambassadors in\r\nLondon should meet me in a conference to be held in London immediately\r\nto endeavor to find a means of arranging the present difficulties. At\r\nthe same time I instructed his Majesty's Ambassadors to ask those\r\nGovernments to authorize their representatives in Vienna, St.\r\nPetersburg, and Belgrade to inform the Governments there of the proposed\r\nconference and to ask them to suspend all active military operations\r\npending the result of the conference.\r\n\r\nTo that I have not yet received complete replies, and it is of course a\r\nproposal in which the co-operation of all four powers is essential. In a\r\ncrisis so grave as this the efforts of one power alone to preserve the\r\npeace must be quite ineffective.\r\n\r\nThe time allowed in this matter has been so short that I have had to\r\ntake the risk of making a proposal without the usual preliminary steps\r\nof trying to ascertain whether it would be well received. But, where\r\nmatters are so grave and the time so short, the risk of proposing\r\nsomething that is unwelcome or ineffective cannot be avoided. I cannot\r\nbut feel, however, assuming that the text of the Servian reply as\r\npublished this morning in the press is accurate, as I believe it to be,\r\nthat it should at least provide a basis on which a friendly and\r\nimpartial group of powers, including powers who are equally in the\r\nconfidence of Austria-Hungary and of Russia, should be able to arrange a\r\nsettlement that would be generally acceptable.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious to any person who reflects upon the situation that\r\nthe moment the dispute ceases to be one between Austria-Hungary and\r\nServia and becomes one in which another great power is involved, it can\r\nbut end in the greatest catastrophe that has ever befallen the Continent\r\nof Europe at one blow; no one can say what would be the limit of the\r\nissues that might be raised by such a conflict; the consequences of it,\r\ndirect and indirect, would be incalculable.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GRAVE SITUATION.\r\n\r\nStatement in House of Commons, July 29, by H.H. Asquith, British Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bonar Law_ (Lancs, Bootle)--May I ask the Prime Minister whether\r\nhe has any information to give the House with regard to the European\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Asquith_--As the House is aware, a formal declaration of war was\r\nissued yesterday by Austria against Servia. The situation at this moment\r\nis one of extreme gravity and I can only say--usefully say--that his\r\nMajesty's Government are not relaxing their efforts to do everything in\r\ntheir power to circumscribe the area of possible conflict. [\"Hear!\r\nhear!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRISK OF A CATASTROPHE.\r\n\r\nDeclaration in House of Commons, July 30, by Prime Minister Asquith.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe meet today under conditions of gravity which are almost unparalleled\r\nin the experience of every one of us. The issues of peace and\r\nwar are hanging in the balance, and with them the risk of a catastrophe\r\nof which it is impossible to measure either the dimensions or the\r\neffects. In these circumstances it is of vital importance in the\r\ninterests of the whole world that this country, which has no interests\r\nof its own directly at stake, should present a united front and be able\r\nto speak and act with the authority of an undivided nation. If we were\r\nto proceed today with the first order on the paper we should inevitably,\r\nunless the debate was conducted with an artificial tone, be involved in\r\nacute controversy in regard to domestic differences whose importance to\r\nourselves no one here in any quarter of the House is disposed to\r\ndisparage or to belittle. I need not say more than that such a use of\r\nour time at such a moment might have injurious, and lastingly injurious,\r\neffects on the international situation. I have had the advantage of\r\nconsultation with the leader of the Opposition, who, I know, shares to\r\nthe full the view which I have expressed. We shall therefore propose to\r\nput off for the present the consideration of the second reading of the\r\namending bill--of course, without prejudice to its future--in the hope\r\nthat by a postponement of the discussion the patriotism of all parties\r\nwill contribute what lies in our power, if not to avert at least to\r\ncircumscribe the calamities which threaten the world. In the meantime\r\nthe business which we shall take will be confined to necessary matters\r\nwhich will not be of a controversial character.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPOSITION CONCURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssent of Bonar Law, Leader of the British Opposition, and of Sir\r\nEdward Carson, July 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Prime Minister has informed the House, it is with our concurrence\r\nthat he has made the suggestion which we have just heard. At a moment\r\nlike the present, when even those of us who do not share diplomatic\r\nsecrets feel that the statement of the Prime Minister is true, that\r\npeace and war may be trembling in the balance, I think it is of the\r\nutmost importance that it should be made plain to every one that,\r\nwhatever our domestic differences may be, they do not prevent us from\r\npresenting a united front in the councils of the world. I am obliged to\r\nthe Prime Minister for saying that in the meantime party controversial\r\nbusiness will not be taken. I am sure that it is his intention, as it\r\nwould be the wish of the whole House, that this postponement will not in\r\nany way prejudice the interests of any of the parties to the\r\ncontroversy. I should like to add--and I do so, not to give information\r\nto the House, the members of which quite understand the position, but in\r\norder that it may be plain outside that in what I have now said I speak\r\nnot only, so far as I am entitled to speak, for the Unionist Party, but\r\nfor Ulster--that in what I have just said I have the concurrence of my\r\nright honorable friend the member for Trinity College [Sir Edward\r\nCarson].\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE THE GREAT OBJECT.\r\n\r\nStatement by Sir Edward Grey in House of Commons, July 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nI regret that I cannot say the situation is less grave than it was\r\nyesterday. The outstanding facts are much the same. Austria has begun\r\nwar against Servia. Russia has ordered a partial mobilization. This has\r\nnot hitherto led to any corresponding steps by other powers, so far as\r\nour information goes. We continue to pursue the one great object of\r\npreserving European peace, and for this purpose we are keeping in close\r\ntouch with other powers. In thus keeping in touch we have, I am glad to\r\nsay, had no difficulty so far; though it has not been possible for the\r\npowers to unite in diplomatic action as was proposed on Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA'S MOBILIZATION.\r\n\r\nStatement in House of Commons by Prime Minister Asquith, Aug. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have just heard, not from St. Petersburg but from Germany, that\r\nRussia has proclaimed a general mobilization of her army and fleet,\r\nand in consequence of this martial law is to be proclaimed in Germany.\r\n\r\nWe understand this to mean that mobilization will follow in Germany if\r\nthe Russian mobilization is general and is proceeded with.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances I should prefer not to answer any further\r\nquestion until Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN INVASION.\r\n\r\nEditorial Article of The London Times, Aug. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe die is cast. The great European struggle which the nations have so\r\nlong struggled to avert has begun. Germany declared war upon Russia on\r\nSaturday evening, and yesterday her troops entered Luxemburg and crossed\r\nthe French frontier in Lorraine without any declaration at all. It is\r\nidle to dwell upon events such as these. They speak for themselves in a\r\nfashion which all can understand. They mean that Europe is to be the\r\nscene of the most terrible war that she has witnessed since the fall of\r\nthe Roman Empire. The losses in human life and in the accumulated wealth\r\nof generations which such a contest must involve are frightful to think\r\non. That it should have come about despite the zealous efforts of\r\ndiplomacy, and against the wishes of almost all the nations whom it is\r\ndestined to afflict, is a grim satire upon the professions of peace yet\r\nfresh upon the lips of those who have plunged the Continent into its\r\nmiseries and its calamities. The blame must fall mainly upon Germany.\r\nShe could have stayed the plague had she chosen to speak in Vienna as\r\nshe speaks when she is in earnest. She has not chosen to do so. She has\r\npreferred to make demands in St. Petersburg and in Paris which no\r\nGovernment could entertain, and to defeat by irrevocable acts the last\r\nefforts of this country and of others for mediation. She has lived up to\r\nthe worst principles of the Frederician tradition--the tradition which\r\ndisregards all obligations of right and wrong at the bidding of\r\nimmediate self-interest. She believes that her admirable military\r\norganization has enabled her to steal a march upon her rivals. She has\r\nbeen mobilizing in all but name, while their mobilization has been\r\nretarded by the \"conversations\" she continued until her moment had come.\r\nThen she flung the mask aside. While her Ambassador was still in Paris,\r\nwhile by the customs traditional with all civilized peoples she was\r\nstill at peace with France, she has sent her soldiers into Luxemburg,\r\nand invaded the territory of the republic. It is hard to say which of\r\nthese acts is the grosser infringement of public right. With Luxemburg\r\nshe makes no pretense of quarrel. She is herself a party to the\r\nguarantee of its neutrality contained in the Treaty of 1867. The other\r\nguarantors are Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Austria-Hungary,\r\nBelgium, and the Netherlands. She solemnly pledged herself with some of\r\nthem, including France and ourselves, to respect this neutrality. The\r\nworld sees how Germany keeps her word. She has been weak enough, or\r\ncynical enough, to issue an explanation of her breach of faith. Let\r\nEnglishmen, who have been disposed to trust her, judge it for\r\nthemselves. She has not, she says, committed a hostile act by crossing\r\nthe frontiers, by forcibly seizing the Government offices, and by\r\nforcibly interrupting the telephonic communication. These are merely\r\nmeasures to protect the railways from a possible attack by the French.\r\nFor the sudden invasion of France no excuse has yet been published. When\r\nit comes it will doubtless be of about equal worth.\r\n\r\nThe whole situation has been revolutionized by the events of yesterday.\r\nThe doubts which many of us tried hard to cherish as to Germany's real\r\nintentions have been dispelled by her high-handed contempt for public\r\nlaw. The Government and the nation now realize that she has been bent on\r\na European war--a European war to be waged in the first instance against\r\nFrance, and through at least one of those neutral States whose safety we\r\nhave bound ourselves to defend because it is indispensable to our own.\r\nThe Cabinet, which has been sitting almost uninterruptedly since\r\nSaturday morning, reached a decision at an early hour yesterday, which\r\nshows that they know what is before us. They have called up the Naval\r\nReserves. They would not have taken this step had they not felt that in\r\nthis quarrel our interests are now directly at stake. After the example\r\nof what Germany has done in Luxemburg and on the French border we can no\r\nlonger rely upon the presence of her Ambassador as a security against\r\nsome sudden surprise. We have no controversy with her, it is true. We\r\nhave been willing and anxious to develop those better relations with her\r\nwhich had of late sprung up. We were eager to work with her for\r\nmediation and for peace. Now she has shown her hand. She is resolved to\r\ncrush France, and to trample upon the rights of those who happen to\r\nstand in her way. Yesterday it was Luxemburg. Today it may be Belgium or\r\nHolland, or she may treat us as she has treated our French friends, and\r\nassail us without a declaration of war. She will find the empire ready.\r\nHere at home and in the far-off dominions the sure instinct of our\r\npeoples teaches them that the ruin of France or of the Low Countries\r\nwould be the prelude to our own. We can no more tolerate a German\r\nhegemony in Europe than we can tolerate the hegemony of any other power.\r\nAs our fathers fought Spain and France in the days of their greatest\r\nstrength to defeat their pretense to Continental supremacy, and their\r\nmenace to the narrow seas, which are the bulwark of our independence, so\r\nshall we be ready, with the same unanimity and the same stubborn\r\ntenacity of purpose, to fight any other nation which shows by her acts\r\nthat she is advancing a like claim and confronting us with a like\r\nthreat. If any individual member of the Cabinet dissents from this view,\r\nthe sooner he quits the Government the better. Mr. Asquith may find it\r\nno disadvantage to take fresh blood into his Administration, as M.\r\nViviani has undoubtedly strengthened the French Government by the\r\nadmission of M. Delcassé and M. Clemenceau. The controversy between\r\nAustria-Hungary and Servia, and that between Austria-Hungary and Russia,\r\nhave passed away from the eyes of the nation. These are fixed on the\r\nGerman attack upon the French Republic and upon Luxemburg. In that\r\nconflict the nation know their duty. With the blessing of Heaven they\r\nwill do it to the uttermost.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE OF EUROPE CANNOT BE PRESERVED.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Grey's Speech in House of Commons, Aug. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast week I stated that we were working for peace not only for this\r\ncountry, but to preserve the peace of Europe. Today events move so\r\nrapidly that it is exceedingly difficult to state with technical\r\naccuracy the actual state of affairs, but it is clear that the peace of\r\nEurope cannot be preserved. Russia and Germany, at any rate, have\r\ndeclared war upon each other.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to state the position of his Majesty's Government I\r\nwould like to clear the ground so that, before I come to state to the\r\nHouse what our attitude is with regard to the present crisis, the House\r\nmay know exactly under what obligations the Government is, or the House\r\ncan be said to be, in coming to a decision on the matter. First of all,\r\nlet me say, very shortly, that we have consistently worked with a single\r\nmind, with all the earnestness in our power, to preserve peace. The\r\nHouse may be satisfied on that point. We have always done it. During\r\nthese last years, as far as his Majesty's Government are concerned, we\r\nwould have no difficulty in proving that we have done so. Throughout the\r\nBalkan crisis, by general admission, we worked for peace. The\r\nco-operation of the great powers of Europe was successful in working for\r\npeace in the Balkan crisis. It is true that some of the powers had great\r\ndifficulty in adjusting their points of view. It took much time and\r\nlabor and discussion before they could settle their differences, but\r\npeace was secured, because peace was their main object, and they were\r\nwilling to give time and trouble rather than accentuate differences\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nIn the present crisis it has not been possible to secure the peace of\r\nEurope; because there has been little time, and there has been a\r\ndisposition--at any rate in some quarters on which I will not dwell--to\r\nforce things rapidly to an issue, at any rate to the great risk of\r\npeace, and, as we now know, the result of that is that the policy of\r\npeace as far as the great powers generally are concerned is in danger. I\r\ndo not want to dwell on that, and to comment on it, and to say where the\r\nblame seems to us to lie, which powers were most in favor of peace,\r\nwhich were most disposed to risk war or endanger peace, because I would\r\nlike the House to approach this crisis in which we are now from the\r\npoint of view of British interests, British honor, and British\r\nobligations, free from all passion as to why peace has not been\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nWe shall publish papers as soon as we can regarding what took place last\r\nweek when we were working for peace, and when those papers are published\r\nI have no doubt that to every human being they will make it clear how\r\nstrenuous and genuine and whole-hearted our efforts for peace were, and\r\nthat they will enable people to form their own judgment as to what\r\nforces were at work which operated against peace.\r\n\r\nI come first, now, to the question of British obligations. I have\r\nassured the House--and the Prime Minister has assured the House more\r\nthan once--that if any crisis such as this arose we should come before\r\nthe House of Commons and be able to say to the House that it was free to\r\ndecide what the British attitude should be, that we would have no secret\r\nengagement which we should spring upon the House, and tell the House\r\nthat because we had entered into that engagement there was an obligation\r\nof honor upon the country. I will deal with that point to clear the\r\nground first.\r\n\r\nThere have been in Europe two diplomatic groups, the Triple Alliance and\r\nwhat came to be called the Triple Entente, for some years past. The\r\nTriple Entente was not an alliance--it was a diplomatic group. The House\r\nwill remember that in 1908 there was a crisis--also a Balkan\r\ncrisis--originating in the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The\r\nRussian Minister, M. Isvolsky, came to London, or happened to come to\r\nLondon, because his visit was planned before the crisis broke out. I\r\ntold him definitely then, this being a Balkan crisis, a Balkan affair, I\r\ndid not consider that public opinion in this country would justify us in\r\npromising to give anything more than diplomatic support. More was never\r\nasked from us, more was never given, and more was never promised.\r\n\r\nIn this present crisis, up till yesterday, we have also given no promise\r\nof anything more than diplomatic support--up till yesterday no promise\r\nof more than diplomatic support. Now I must make this question of\r\nobligation clear to the House. I must go back to the first Moroccan\r\ncrisis of 1906. That was the time of the Algeciras Conference, and it\r\ncame at a time of very great difficulty to his Majesty's Government when\r\na general election was in progress, and Ministers were scattered over\r\nthe country, and I--spending three days a week in my constituency and\r\nthree days at the Foreign Office--was asked the question whether, if\r\nthat crisis developed into war between France and Germany, we would give\r\narmed support. I said then that I could promise nothing to any foreign\r\npower unless it was subsequently to receive the whole-hearted support of\r\npublic opinion here if the occasion arose. I said, in my opinion, if war\r\nwas forced upon France then on the question of Morocco--a question which\r\nhad just been the subject of agreement between this country and France,\r\nan agreement exceedingly popular on both sides--that if out of that\r\nagreement war was forced on France at that time, in my view public\r\nopinion in this country would have rallied to the material support of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nI gave no promise, but I expressed that opinion during the crisis, as\r\nfar as I remember almost in the same words, to the French Ambassador\r\nand the German Ambassador at the time. I made no promise and I used no\r\nthreats; but I expressed that opinion. That position was accepted by the\r\nFrench Government, but they said to me at the time, and I think very\r\nreasonably, \"If you think it possible that the public opinion of Great\r\nBritain might, should a sudden crisis arise, justify you in giving to\r\nFrance the armed support which you cannot promise in advance, you will\r\nnot be able to give that support, even if you wish it, when the time\r\ncomes, unless some conversations have already taken place between naval\r\nand military experts.\" There was force in that. I agreed to it, and\r\nauthorized those conversations to take place, but on the distinct\r\nunderstanding that nothing which passed between military or naval\r\nexperts should bind either Government or restrict in any way their\r\nfreedom to make a decision as to whether or not they would give that\r\nsupport when the time arose.\r\n\r\nAs I have told the House, upon that occasion a general election was in\r\nprospect; I had to take the responsibility of doing that without the\r\nCabinet. It could not be summoned. An answer had to be given. I\r\nconsulted Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Prime Minister; I consulted,\r\nI remember, Lord Haldane, who was then Secretary of State for War, and\r\nthe present Prime Minister, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\nThat was the most I could do, and they authorized that, on the distinct\r\nunderstanding that it left the hands of the Government free whenever the\r\ncrisis arose. The fact that conversations between military and naval\r\nexperts took place was later on--I think much later on, because that\r\ncrisis passed, and the thing ceased to be of importance--but later on it\r\nwas brought to the knowledge of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe Agadir crisis came--another Morocco crisis--and throughout that I\r\ntook precisely the same line that had been taken in 1906. But\r\nsubsequently, in 1912, after discussion and consideration in the\r\nCabinet, it was decided that we ought to have a definite understanding\r\nin writing, which was to be only in the form of an unofficial letter,\r\nthat these conversations which took place were not binding upon the\r\nfreedom of either Government; and on the 22d November, 1912, I wrote to\r\nthe French Ambassador the letter which I will now read to the House, and\r\nI received from him a letter in similar terms in reply. The letter which\r\nI have to read to the House is this, and it will be known to the public\r\nnow as the record that, whatever took place between military and naval\r\nexperts, they were not binding engagements upon the Government:\r\n\r\n     My dear Ambassador:\r\n\r\n     From time to time in recent years the French and British naval and\r\n     military experts have consulted together. It has always been\r\n     understood that such consultation does not restrict the freedom of\r\n     either Government to decide at any future time whether or not to\r\n     assist the other by armed force. We have agreed that consultation\r\n     between experts is not, and ought not, to be regarded as an\r\n     engagement that commits either Government to action in a\r\n     contingency that has not yet arisen and may never arise. The\r\n     disposition, for instance, of the French and British fleets\r\n     respectively at the present moment is not based upon an engagement\r\n     to co-operate in war.\r\n\r\n     You have, however, pointed out that, if either Government had grave\r\n     reason to expect an unprovoked attack by a third power, it might\r\n     become essential to know whether it could in that event depend upon\r\n     the armed assistance of the other.\r\n\r\n     I agree that, if either Government had grave reason to expect an\r\n     unprovoked attack by a third power, or something that threatened\r\n     the general peace, it should immediately discuss with the other\r\n     whether both Governments should act together to prevent aggression\r\n     and to preserve peace, and, if so, what measures they would be\r\n     prepared to take in common.\r\n\r\n_Lord Charles Beresford_--What is the date of that?\r\n\r\n_Sir E. Grey_--The 22nd November, 1912. That is the starting point for\r\nthe Government with regard to the present crisis. I think it makes it\r\nclear that what the Prime Minister and I said to the House of Commons\r\nwas perfectly justified, and that, as regards our freedom to decide in a\r\ncrisis what our line should be, whether we should intervene or whether\r\nwe should abstain, the Government remained perfectly free, and, a\r\nfortiori, the House of Commons remains perfectly free. That I say to\r\nclear the ground from the point of view of obligation. I think it was\r\ndue to prove our good faith to the House of Commons that I should give\r\nthat full information to the House now, and say what I think is obvious\r\nfrom the letter I have just read, that we do not construe anything which\r\nhas previously taken place in our diplomatic relations with other powers\r\nin this matter as restricting the freedom of the Government to decide\r\nwhat attitude they should take now, or restrict the freedom of the House\r\nof Commons to decide what their attitude should be.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, I will go further, and I will say this: The situation in the\r\npresent crisis is not precisely the same as it was in the Morocco\r\nquestion. In the Morocco question it was primarily a dispute which\r\nconcerned France--a dispute which concerned France and France\r\nprimarily--a dispute, as it seemed to us, affecting France out of an\r\nagreement subsisting between us and France, and published to the whole\r\nworld, in which we engaged to give France diplomatic support. No doubt\r\nwe were pledged to give nothing but diplomatic support; we were, at any\r\nrate, pledged by a definite public agreement to stand with France\r\ndiplomatically in that question.\r\n\r\nThe present crisis has originated differently. It has not originated\r\nwith regard to Morocco. It has not originated as regards anything with\r\nwhich we had a special agreement with France; it has not originated with\r\nanything which primarily concerned France. It has originated in a\r\ndispute between Austria and Servia. I can say this with the most\r\nabsolute confidence--no Government and no country has less desire to be\r\ninvolved in war over a dispute with Austria and Servia than the\r\nGovernment and the Country of France. They are involved in it because of\r\ntheir obligation of honor under a definite alliance with Russia. Well,\r\nit is only fair to say to the House that that obligation of honor cannot\r\napply in the same way to us. We are not parties to the Franco-Russian\r\nalliance. We do not even know the terms of that alliance. So far I\r\nhave, I think, faithfully and completely cleared the ground with regard\r\nto the question of obligation.\r\n\r\nI now come to what we think the situation requires of us. For many years\r\nwe have had a long-standing friendship with France. I remember well the\r\nfeeling in the House--and my own feeling--for I spoke on the subject, I\r\nthink, when the late Government made their agreement with France--the\r\nwarm and cordial feeling resulting from the fact that these two nations,\r\nwho had had perpetual differences in the past, had cleared these\r\ndifferences away; I remember saying, I think, that it seemed to me that\r\nsome benign influence had been at work to produce the cordial atmosphere\r\nthat had made that possible. But how far that friendship entails\r\nobligation--it has been a friendship between the nations and ratified by\r\nthe nations--how far that entails an obligation, let every man look into\r\nhis own heart, and his own feelings, and construe the extent of the\r\nobligation for himself. I construe it myself as I feel it, but I do not\r\nwish to urge upon any one else more than their feelings dictate as to\r\nwhat they should feel about the obligation. The House, individually and\r\ncollectively, may judge for itself. I speak my personal view, and I have\r\ngiven the House my own feeling in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe French fleet is now in the Mediterranean, and the northern and\r\nwestern coasts of France are absolutely undefended. The French fleet\r\nbeing concentrated in the Mediterranean, the situation is very different\r\nfrom what it used to be, because the friendship which has grown up\r\nbetween the two countries has given them a sense of security that there\r\nwas nothing to be feared from us.\r\n\r\nThe French coasts are absolutely undefended. The French fleet is in the\r\nMediterranean, and has for some years been concentrated there because of\r\nthe feeling of confidence and friendship which has existed between the\r\ntwo countries. My own feeling is that if a foreign fleet, engaged in a\r\nwar which France had not sought, and in which she had not been the\r\naggressor, came down the English Channel and bombarded and battered the\r\nundefended coasts of France, we could not stand aside, and see this\r\ngoing on practically within sight of our eyes, with our arms folded,\r\nlooking on dispassionately, doing nothing. I believe that would be the\r\nfeeling of this country. There are times when one feels that if these\r\ncircumstances actually did arise, it would be a feeling which would\r\nspread with irresistible force throughout the land.\r\n\r\nBut I also want to look at the matter without sentiment, and from the\r\npoint of view of British interests, and it is on that that I am going to\r\nbase and justify what I am presently going to say to the House. If we\r\nsay nothing at this moment, what is France to do with her fleet in the\r\nMediterranean? If she leaves it there, with no statement from us as to\r\nwhat we will do, she leaves her northern and western coasts absolutely\r\nundefended, at the mercy of a German fleet coming down the Channel to do\r\nas it pleases in a war which is a war of life and death between them. If\r\nwe say nothing, it may be that the French fleet is withdrawn from the\r\nMediterranean. We are in the presence of a European conflagration; can\r\nanybody set limits to the consequences that may arise out of it? Let us\r\nassume that today we stand aside in an attitude of neutrality, saying,\r\n\"No, we cannot undertake and engage to help either party in this\r\nconflict.\" Let us suppose the French fleet is withdrawn from the\r\nMediterranean; and let us assume that the consequences--which are\r\nalready tremendous in what has happened in Europe even to countries\r\nwhich are at peace--in fact, equally whether countries are at peace or\r\nat war--let us assume that out of that come consequences unforeseen,\r\nwhich make it necessary at a sudden moment that, in defense of vital\r\nBritish interests, we shall go to war; and let us assume--which is quite\r\npossible--that Italy, who is now neutral--because, as I understand, she\r\nconsiders that this war is an aggressive war, and the Triple Alliance\r\nbeing a defensive alliance her obligation did not arise--let us assume\r\nthat consequences which are not yet foreseen and which, perfectly\r\nlegitimately consulting her own interests, make Italy depart from her\r\nattitude of neutrality at a time when we are forced in defense of vital\r\nBritish interests ourselves to fight--what then will be the position in\r\nthe Mediterranean? It might be that at some critical moment those\r\nconsequences would be forced upon us because our trade routes in the\r\nMediterranean might be vital to this country.\r\n\r\nNobody can say that in the course of the next few weeks there is any\r\nparticular trade route, the keeping open of which may not be vital to\r\nthis country. What will be our position then? We have not kept a fleet\r\nin the Mediterranean which is equal to dealing alone with a combination\r\nof other fleets in the Mediterranean. It would be the very moment when\r\nwe could not detach more ships to the Mediterranean, and we might have\r\nexposed this country from our negative attitude at the present moment to\r\nthe most appalling risk. I say that from the point of view of British\r\ninterests. We feel strongly that France was entitled to know--and to\r\nknow at once--whether or not in the event of attack upon her unprotected\r\nnorthern and western coasts she could depend upon British support. In\r\nthat emergency, and in these compelling circumstances, yesterday\r\nafternoon I gave to the French Ambassador the following statement:\r\n\r\n     I am authorized to give an assurance that if the German fleet comes\r\n     into the Channel or through the North Sea to undertake hostile\r\n     operations against the French coasts or shipping, the British fleet\r\n     will give all the protection in its power. This assurance is, of\r\n     course, subject to the policy of his Majesty's Government receiving\r\n     the support of Parliament, and must not be taken as binding his\r\n     Majesty's Government to take any action until the above contingency\r\n     of action by the German fleet takes place.\r\n\r\nI read that to the House, not as a declaration of war on our part, not\r\nas entailing immediate aggressive action on our part, but as binding us\r\nto take aggressive action should that contingency arise. Things move\r\nvery hurriedly from hour to hour. Fresh news comes in, and I cannot give\r\nthis in any very formal way; but I understand that the German\r\nGovernment would be prepared, if we would pledge ourselves to\r\nneutrality, to agree that its fleet would not attack the northern coast\r\nof France. I have only heard that shortly before I came to the House,\r\nbut it is far too narrow an engagement for us. And, Sir, there is the\r\nmore serious consideration--becoming more serious every hour--there is\r\nthe question of the neutrality of Belgium.\r\n\r\nI shall have to put before the House at some length what is our position\r\nin regard to Belgium. The governing factor is the Treaty of 1839, but\r\nthis is a treaty with a history--a history accumulated since. In 1870,\r\nwhen there was war between France and Germany, the question of the\r\nneutrality of Belgium arose, and various things were said. Among other\r\nthings, Prince Bismarck gave an assurance to Belgium that--confirming\r\nhis verbal assurance, he gave in writing a declaration which he said was\r\nsuperfluous in reference to the treaty in existence--that the German\r\nConfederation and its allies would respect the neutrality of Belgium, it\r\nbeing always understood that that neutrality would be respected by the\r\nother belligerent powers. That is valuable as a recognition in 1870 on\r\nthe part of Germany of the sacredness of these treaty rights.\r\n\r\nWhat was our own attitude? The people who laid down the attitude of the\r\nBritish Government were Lord Granville in the House of Lords and Mr.\r\nGladstone in the House of Commons. Lord Granville on the 8th August,\r\n1870, used these words. He said:\r\n\r\n     We might have explained to the country and to foreign nations that\r\n     we could not think this country was bound either morally or\r\n     internationally, or that its interests were concerned in the\r\n     maintenance of the neutrality of Belgium; though this course might\r\n     have had some conveniences, though it might have been easy to\r\n     adhere to it, though it might have saved us from some immediate\r\n     danger, it is a course which her Majesty's Government thought it\r\n     impossible to adopt in the name of the country with any due regard\r\n     to the country's honor or to the country's interests.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, spoke as follows two days later:\r\n\r\n     There is, I admit, the obligation of the treaty. It is not\r\n     necessary, nor would time permit me, to enter into the complicated\r\n     question of the nature of the obligations of that treaty; but I am\r\n     not able to subscribe to the doctrine of those who have held in\r\n     this House what plainly amounts to an assertion, that the simple\r\n     fact of the existence of a guarantee is binding on every party to\r\n     it, irrespectively altogether of the particular position in which\r\n     it may find itself at the time when the occasion for acting on the\r\n     guarantee arises. The great authorities upon foreign policy to whom\r\n     I have been accustomed to listen, such as Lord Aberdeen and Lord\r\n     Palmerston, never to my knowledge took that rigid and, if I may\r\n     venture to say so, that impracticable view of the guarantee. The\r\n     circumstance, that there is already an existing guarantee in force,\r\n     is, of necessity, an important fact, and a weighty element in the\r\n     case, to which we are bound to give full and ample consideration.\r\n     There is also this further consideration, the force of which we\r\n     must all feel most deeply, and that is, the common interests\r\n     against the unmeasured aggrandizement of any power whatever.\r\n\r\nThe treaty is an old treaty--1839--and that was the view taken of it in\r\n1870. It is one of those treaties which are founded, not only on\r\nconsideration for Belgium, which benefits under the treaty, but in the\r\ninterests of those who guarantee the neutrality of Belgium. The honor\r\nand interests are, at least, as strong today as in 1870, and we cannot\r\ntake a more narrow view or a less serious view of our obligations, and\r\nof the importance of those obligations, than was taken by Mr.\r\nGladstone's Government in 1870.\r\n\r\nI will read to the House what took place last week on this subject. When\r\nmobilization was beginning, I knew that this question must be a most\r\nimportant element in our policy--a most important subject for the House\r\nof Commons. I telegraphed at the same time in similar terms to both\r\nParis and Berlin to say that it was essential for us to know whether the\r\nFrench and German Governments respectively were prepared to undertake an\r\nengagement to respect the neutrality of Belgium. These are the replies.\r\nI got from the French Government this reply:\r\n\r\n     The French Government are resolved to respect the neutrality of\r\n     Belgium, and it would only be in the event of some other power\r\n     violating that neutrality that France might find herself under the\r\n     necessity, in order to assure the defense of her security, to act\r\n     otherwise. This assurance has been given several times. The\r\n     President of the Republic spoke of it to the King of the Belgians,\r\n     and the French Minister at Brussels has spontaneously renewed the\r\n     assurance to the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs today.\r\n\r\nFrom the German Government the reply was:\r\n\r\n     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs could not possibly give\r\n     an answer before consulting the Emperor and the Imperial\r\n     Chancellor.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Goschen, to whom I had said it was important to have an\r\nanswer soon, said he hoped the answer would not be too long delayed. The\r\nGerman Minister for Foreign Affairs then gave Sir Edward Goschen to\r\nunderstand that he rather doubted whether they could answer at all, as\r\nany reply they might give could not fail, in the event of war, to have\r\nthe undesirable effect of disclosing, to a certain extent, part of their\r\nplan of campaign. I telegraphed at the same time to Brussels to the\r\nBelgian Government, and I got the following reply from Sir Francis\r\nVilliers:\r\n\r\n     Belgium expects and desires that other powers will observe and\r\n     uphold her neutrality, which she intends to maintain to the utmost\r\n     of her power. In so informing me, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\n     said, that, in the event of the violation of the neutrality of\r\n     their territory, they believed that they were in a position to\r\n     defend themselves against intrusion. The relations between Belgium\r\n     and her neighbors were excellent, and there was no reason to\r\n     suspect their intentions; but he thought it well, nevertheless, to\r\n     be prepared against emergencies.\r\n\r\nIt now appears from the news I have received today--which has come quite\r\nrecently, and I am not yet quite sure how far it has reached me in an\r\naccurate form--that an ultimatum has been given to Belgium by Germany,\r\nthe object of which was to offer Belgium friendly relations with Germany\r\non condition that she would facilitate the passage of German troops\r\nthrough Belgium. Well, Sir, until one has these things absolutely\r\ndefinitely, up to the last moment, I do not wish to say all that one\r\nwould say if one were in a position to give the House full, complete,\r\nand absolute information upon the point. We were sounded in the course\r\nof last week as to whether, if a guarantee were given that, after the\r\nwar, Belgian integrity would be preserved, that would content us. We\r\nreplied that we could not bargain away whatever interests or obligations\r\nwe had in Belgian neutrality.\r\n\r\nShortly before I reached the House I was informed that the following\r\ntelegram had been received from the King of the Belgians by our\r\nKing--King George:\r\n\r\n     Remembering the numerous proofs of your Majesty's friendship and\r\n     that of your predecessors, and the friendly attitude of England in\r\n     1870, and the poof of friendship she has just given us again, I\r\n     make a supreme appeal to the diplomatic intervention of your\r\n     Majesty's Government to safeguard the integrity of Belgium.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic intervention took place last week on our part. What can\r\ndiplomatic intervention do now? We have great and vital interests in the\r\nindependence--and integrity is the least part--of Belgium. If Belgium is\r\ncompelled to submit to allow her neutrality to be violated, of course\r\nthe situation is clear. Even if by agreement she admitted the violation\r\nof her neutrality, it is clear she could only do so under duress. The\r\nsmaller States in that region of Europe ask but one thing. Their one\r\ndesire is that they should be left alone and independent. The one thing\r\nthey fear is, I think, not so much that their integrity but that their\r\nindependence should be interfered with. If in this war which is before\r\nEurope the neutrality of one of those countries is violated, if the\r\ntroops of one of the combatants violate its neutrality and no action be\r\ntaken to resent it, at the end of the war, whatever the integrity may\r\nbe, the independence will be gone.\r\n\r\nI have one further quotation from Mr. Gladstone as to what he thought\r\nabout the independence of Belgium. It will be found in \"Hansard,\" Vol.\r\n203, Page 1,787. I have not had time to read the whole speech and verify\r\nthe context, but the thing seems to me so clear that no context could\r\nmake any difference to the meaning of it. Mr. Gladstone said:\r\n\r\n     We have an interest in the independence of Belgium which is wider\r\n     than that which we may have in the literal operation of the\r\n     guarantee. It is found in the answer to the question whether, under\r\n     the circumstances of the case, this country, endowed as it is with\r\n     influence and power, would quietly stand by and witness the\r\n     perpetration of the direst crime that ever stained the pages of\r\n     history, and thus become participators in the sin.\r\n\r\nNo, Sir, if it be the case that there has been anything in the nature of\r\nan ultimatum to Belgium, asking her to compromise or violate her\r\nneutrality, whatever may have been offered to her in return, her\r\nindependence is gone if that holds. If her independence goes, the\r\nindependence of Holland will follow. I ask the House from the point of\r\nview of British interests to consider what may be at stake. If France is\r\nbeaten in a struggle of life and death, beaten to her knees, loses her\r\nposition as a great power, becomes subordinate to the will and power of\r\none greater than herself--consequences which I do not anticipate,\r\nbecause I am sure that France has the power to defend herself with all\r\nthe energy and ability and patriotism which she has shown so\r\noften--still, if that were to happen, and if Belgium fell under the same\r\ndominating influence, and then Holland, and then Denmark, then would not\r\nMr. Gladstone's words come true, that just opposite to us there would be\r\na common interest against the unmeasured aggrandizement of any power?\r\n\r\nIt may be said, I suppose, that we might stand aside, husband our\r\nstrength, and that, whatever happened in the course of this war, at the\r\nend of it intervene with effect to put things right, and to adjust them\r\nto our own point of view. If, in a crisis like this, we run away from\r\nthose obligations of honor and interest as regards the Belgian treaty, I\r\ndoubt whether, whatever material force we might have at the end, it\r\nwould be of very much value in face of the respect that we should have\r\nlost. And do not believe, whether a great power stands outside this war\r\nor not, it is going to be in a position at the end of it to exert its\r\nsuperior strength. For us, with a powerful fleet, which we believe able\r\nto protect our commerce, to protect our shores, and to protect our\r\ninterests, if we are engaged in war, we shall suffer but little more\r\nthan we shall suffer even if we stand aside.\r\n\r\nWe are going to suffer, I am afraid, terribly in this war, whether we\r\nare in it or whether we stand aside. Foreign trade is going to stop, not\r\nbecause the trade routes are closed, but because there is no trade at\r\nthe other end. Continental nations engaged in war--all their\r\npopulations, all their energies, all their wealth, engaged in a\r\ndesperate struggle--they cannot carry on the trade with us that they are\r\ncarrying on in times of peace, whether we are parties to the war or\r\nwhether we are not. I do not believe for a moment that at the end of\r\nthis war, even if we stood aside and remained aside, we should be in a\r\nposition, a material position, to use our force decisively to undo what\r\nhad happened in the course of the war, to prevent the whole of the west\r\nof Europe opposite to us--if that had been the result of the\r\nwar--falling under the domination of a single power, and I am quite sure\r\nthat our moral position would be such as to have lost us all respect. I\r\ncan only say that I have put the question of Belgium somewhat\r\nhypothetically, because I am not yet sure of all the facts, but, if the\r\nfacts turn out to be as they have reached us at present, it is quite\r\nclear that there is an obligation on this country to do its utmost to\r\nprevent the consequences to which those facts will lead if they are\r\nundisputed.\r\n\r\nI have read to the House the only engagements that we have yet taken\r\ndefinitely with regard to the use of force. I think it is due to the\r\nHouse to say that we have taken no engagement yet with regard to sending\r\nan expeditionary armed force out of the country. Mobilization of the\r\nfleet has taken place; mobilization of the army is taking place; but we\r\nhave as yet taken no engagement, because I feel that--in the case of a\r\nEuropean conflagration such as this, unprecedented, with our enormous\r\nresponsibilities in India and other parts of the empire, or in countries\r\nin British occupation, with all the unknown factors--we must take very\r\ncarefully into consideration the use which we make of sending an\r\nexpeditionary force out of the country until we know how we stand. One\r\nthing I would say.\r\n\r\nThe one bright spot in the whole of this, terrible situation is Ireland.\r\nThe general feeling throughout Ireland--and I would like this to be\r\nclearly understood abroad--does not make the Irish question a\r\nconsideration which we feel we have now to take into account. I have\r\ntold the House how far we have at present gone in commitments and the\r\nconditions which influence our policy, and I have put to the House and\r\ndwelt at length upon how vital is the condition of the neutrality of\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\nWhat other policy Is there before the House? There is but one way in\r\nwhich the Government could make certain at the present moment of keeping\r\noutside this war, and that would be that it should immediately issue a\r\nproclamation of unconditional neutrality. We cannot do that. We have\r\nmade the commitment to France that I have read to the House which\r\nprevents us doing that. We have got the consideration of Belgium which\r\nprevents us also from any unconditional neutrality, and, without these\r\nconditions absolutely satisfied and satisfactory, we are bound not to\r\nshrink from proceeding to the use of all the forces in our power. If we\r\ndid take that line by saying, \"We will have nothing whatever to do with\r\nthis matter\" under no conditions--the Belgian treaty obligations, the\r\npossible position in the Mediterranean, with damage to British\r\ninterests, and what may happen to France from our failure to support\r\nFrance--if we were to say that all those things mattered nothing, were\r\nas nothing, and to say we would stand aside, we should, I believe,\r\nsacrifice our respect and good name and reputation before the world, and\r\nshould not escape the most serious and grave economic consequences.\r\n\r\nMy object has been to explain the view of the Government, and to place\r\nbefore the House the issue and the choice. I do not for a moment\r\nconceal, after what I have said, and after the information, incomplete\r\nas it is, that I have given to the House with regard to Belgium, that\r\nwe must be prepared, and we are prepared, for the consequences of having\r\nto use all the strength we have at any moment--we know not how soon--to\r\ndefend ourselves and to take our part. We know, if the facts all be as I\r\nhave stated them, though I have announced no intending aggressive action\r\non our part, no final decision to resort to force at a moment's notice,\r\nuntil we know the whole of the case, that the use of it may be forced\r\nupon us. As far as the forces of the Crown are concerned, we are ready.\r\nI believe the Prime Minister and my right honorable friend the First\r\nLord of the Admiralty have no doubt whatever that the readiness and the\r\nefficiency of those forces were never at a higher mark than they are\r\ntoday, and never was there a time when confidence was more justified in\r\nthe power of the navy to protect our commerce and to protect our shores.\r\nThe thought is with us always of the suffering and misery entailed, from\r\nwhich no country in Europe will escape by abstention, and from which no\r\nneutrality will save us. The amount of harm that can be done by an enemy\r\nship to our trade is infinitesimal, compared with the amount of harm\r\nthat must be done by the economic condition that is caused on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nThe most awful responsibility is resting upon the Government in deciding\r\nwhat to advise the House of Commons to do. We have disclosed our minds\r\nto the House of Commons. We have disclosed the issue, the information\r\nwhich we have, and made clear to the House, I trust, that we are\r\nprepared to face that situation, and that should it develop, as probably\r\nit may develop, we will face it. We worked for peace up to the last\r\nmoment, and beyond the last moment. How hard, how persistently, and how\r\nearnestly we strove for peace last week the House will see from the\r\npapers that will be before it.\r\n\r\nBut that is over, as far as the peace of Europe is concerned. We are now\r\nface to face with a situation and all the consequences which it may yet\r\nhave to unfold. We believe we shall have the support of the House at\r\nlarge in proceeding to whatever the consequences may be and whatever\r\nmeasures may be forced upon us by the development of facts or action\r\ntaken by others. I believe the country, so quickly has the situation\r\nbeen forced upon it, has not had time to realize the issue. It perhaps\r\nis still thinking of the quarrel between Austria and Servia, and not the\r\ncomplications of this matter which have grown out of the quarrel between\r\nAustria and Servia. Russia and Germany we know are at war. We do not yet\r\nknow officially that Austria, the ally whom Germany is to support, is\r\nyet at war with Russia. We know that a good deal has been happening on\r\nthe French frontier. We do not know that the German Ambassador has left\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThe situation has developed so rapidly that technically, as regards the\r\ncondition of the war, it is most difficult to describe what has actually\r\nhappened. I wanted to bring out the underlying issues which would affect\r\nour own conduct, and our own policy, and to put them clearly. I have now\r\nput the vital facts before the House, and if, as seems not improbable,\r\nwe are forced, and rapidly forced, to take our stand upon those issues,\r\nthen I believe, when the country realizes what is at stake, what the\r\nreal issues are, the magnitude of the impending dangers in the west of\r\nEurope, which I have endeavored to describe to the House, we shall be\r\nsupported throughout, not only by the House of Commons, but by the\r\ndetermination, the resolution, the courage, and the endurance of the\r\nwhole country.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY AND BELGIUM.\r\n\r\nFurther Statement by Sir Edward Grey in House of Commons, Aug. 3,\r\n1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to give the House some information which I have received, and\r\nwhich was not in my possession when I made my statement this afternoon.\r\nIt is information I have received from the Belgian Legation in London,\r\nand is to the following effect:\r\n\r\n     Germany sent yesterday evening at 7 o'clock a note proposing to\r\n     Belgium friendly neutrality, covering free passage on Belgian\r\n     territory, and promising maintenance of independence of the kingdom\r\n     and possession at the conclusion of peace, and threatening, in case\r\n     of refusal, to treat Belgium as an enemy. A time limit of twelve\r\n     hours was fixed for the reply. The Belgians have answered that an\r\n     attack on their neutrality would be a flagrant violation of the\r\n     rights of nations, and that to accept the German proposal would be\r\n     to sacrifice the honor of a nation. Conscious of its duty, Belgium\r\n     is firmly resolved to repel aggression by all possible means.\r\n\r\nOf course, I can only say that the Government are prepared to take into\r\ngrave consideration the information which they have received. I make no\r\nfurther comment upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNHESITATING SUPPORT.\r\n\r\nStatement by Bonar Law, Opposition Leader, in House of Commons, Aug.\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman has made an appeal for support and it is\r\nnecessary that I should say a word or two, but they shall be very few. I\r\nwish to say in the first place that I do not believe there is a single\r\nmember in this House who doubts that not only the right honorable\r\ngentleman himself, but the Government which he represents, have done\r\neverything in their power up to the last moment to preserve peace.\r\n[Cheers.] And I think we may be sure that if any other course is taken\r\nit is because it is forced upon them and that they have absolutely no\r\nalternative. [Cheers.] One thing only further I should like to say. The\r\nright honorable gentleman spoke of the bright spot in the picture which\r\nonly a day or two ago was a black spot in the political horizon.\r\nEverything that he has said I am sure is true and I should like to say\r\nthis further--that if the contingencies which he has not put into words,\r\nbut which are in all our minds as possible, arise, then we have already\r\nhad indications that there is another bright spot--that every one of his\r\nMajesty's dominions beyond the seas will be behind us in whatever act it\r\nis necessary to take. [Cheers.] This only I should add. The Government\r\nalready know, but I give them now the assurance on behalf of the party\r\nof which I am leader in this House, that in whatever steps they think it\r\nnecessary to take for the honor and security of this country they can\r\nrely upon the unhesitating support of the Opposition. [Loud Ministerial\r\nand Opposition cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGED IRISH FEELING.\r\n\r\nStatement in House of Commons, Aug. 3, by John E. Redmond, M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope the House will not consider it improper on my part in the grave\r\ncircumstances in which we are assembled if I intervene for a very few\r\nmoments. I was moved a great deal by that sentence in the speech of the\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in which he said that the one\r\nbright spot in the situation was the changed feeling in Ireland. In past\r\ntimes, when this empire has been engaged in these terrible enterprises\r\nit is true--it would be the utmost affectation and folly on my part to\r\ndeny it--the sympathy of the Nationalists of Ireland, for reasons to be\r\nfound deep down in centuries of history, has been estranged from this\r\ncountry. But allow me to say that what has occurred in recent years has\r\naltered the situation completely. [Ministerial cheers.] I must not\r\ntouch, and I may be trusted not to touch, on any controversial topics,\r\nbut this I may be allowed to say--that a wider knowledge of the real\r\nfacts of Irish history have, I think, altered the view of the democracy\r\nof this country toward the Irish question, and today I honestly believe\r\nthat the democracy of Ireland will turn with the utmost anxiety and\r\nsympathy to this country in every trial and every danger that may\r\novertake it. [General cheers.] There is a possibility at any rate of\r\nhistory repeating itself. The House will remember that in 1778, at the\r\nend of the disastrous American war, when it might, I think, truly be\r\nsaid that the military power of this country was almost at its lowest\r\nebb, and when the shores of Ireland were threatened with foreign\r\ninvasion, a body of 100,000 Irish volunteers sprang into existence for\r\nthe purpose of defending her shores. At first no Catholic--ah! how sad\r\nthe reading of the history of those days is--was allowed to be enrolled\r\nin that body of volunteers, and yet from the very first day the\r\nCatholics of the South and West subscribed money and sent it toward the\r\narming of their Protestant fellow-countrymen. Ideas widened as time went\r\non, and finally the Catholics in the South were armed and enrolled\r\nbrothers in arms with their fellow-countrymen of a different creed in\r\nthe North. May history repeat itself! [Cheers.] Today there are in\r\nIreland two large bodies of volunteers. One of them sprang into\r\nexistence in the North. Another has sprung into existence in the South.\r\nI say to the Government that they may tomorrow withdraw every one of\r\ntheir troops from Ireland. [General cheers.] I say that the coasts of\r\nIreland will be defended from foreign invasion by her armed sons, and\r\nfor this purpose armed Nationalist Catholics in the South will be only\r\ntoo glad to join arms with the armed Protestant Ulstermen in the North.\r\n[Cheers.] Is it too much to hope that out of this situation there may\r\nspring a result which will be good not merely for the empire, but good\r\nfor the future welfare and integrity of the Irish Nation. [Cheers.] I\r\nought to apologize for having intervened [cries of \"No\"], but while\r\nIrishmen generally are in favor of peace, and would desire to save the\r\ndemocracy of this country from all the horrors of war, while we would\r\nmake any possible sacrifice for that purpose, still if the dire\r\nnecessity is forced upon this country we offer to the Government of the\r\nday that they may take their troops away, and that if it is allowed to\r\nus in comradeship with our brethren in the North we will ourselves\r\ndefend the coasts of our country. [Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN'S ULTIMATUM TO GERMANY.\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Asquith Explains Its Nature in House of Commons, Aug. 4,\r\n1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bonar Law_--I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he has any\r\nstatement that he can now make to the House?\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister_ (_Mr. Asquith_)--In conformity with the statement\r\nof policy made here by my right honorable friend the Foreign Secretary\r\nyesterday, a telegram was early this morning sent by him to our\r\nAmbassador in Berlin. It was to this effect:\r\n\r\n     The King of the Belgians has made an appeal to his Majesty the King\r\n     for diplomatic intervention on behalf of Belgium. His Majesty's\r\n     Government are also informed that the German Government have\r\n     delivered to the Belgian Government a note proposing friendly\r\n     neutrality entailing free passage through Belgian territory, and\r\n     promising to maintain the independence and integrity of the kingdom\r\n     and its possessions at the conclusion of peace, threatening in case\r\n     of refusal to treat Belgium as an enemy. An answer was requested\r\n     within twelve hours. We also understand that Belgium has\r\n     categorically refused this as a flagrant violation of the law of\r\n     nations. His Majesty's Government are bound to protest against this\r\n     violation of a treaty to which Germany is a party in common with\r\n     themselves, and must request an assurance that the demand made upon\r\n     Belgium may not be proceeded with, and that her neutrality will be\r\n     respected by Germany. You should ask for an immediate reply.\r\n\r\nWe received this morning from our Minister at Brussels the following\r\ntelegram:\r\n\r\n     German Minister has this morning addressed note to the Belgian\r\n     Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that, as Belgian Government\r\n     have declined the well-intended proposals submitted to them by the\r\n     Imperial Government, the latter will, deeply to their regret, be\r\n     compelled to carry out, if necessary by force of arms, the measures\r\n     considered indispensable in view of the French menaces.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously--almost immediately afterward--we received from the\r\nBelgian Legation here in London the following telegram:\r\n\r\n     General Staff announces that territory has been violated at\r\n     Gemmenich (near Aix-la-Chapelle).\r\n\r\nSubsequent information tended to show that the German force has\r\npenetrated still further into Belgian territory. We also received this\r\nmorning from the German Ambassador here the telegram sent to him by the\r\nGerman Foreign Secretary, and communicated by the Ambassador to us. It\r\nis in these terms:\r\n\r\n     Please dispel any mistrust that may subsist on the part of the\r\n     British Government with regard to our intentions by repeating most\r\n     positively formal assurance that, even in the case of armed\r\n     conflict with Belgium, Germany will, under no pretense whatever,\r\n     annex Belgian territory. Sincerity of this declaration is borne out\r\n     by fact that we solemnly pledged our word to Holland strictly to\r\n     respect her neutrality. It is obvious that we could not profitably\r\n     annex Belgic territory without making at the same time territorial\r\n     acquisitions at expense of Holland. Please impress upon Sir E. Grey\r\n     that German Army could not be exposed to French attack across\r\n     Belgium, which was planned according to absolutely unimpeachable\r\n     information. Germany had consequently to disregard Belgian\r\n     neutrality, it being for her a question of life or death to prevent\r\n     French advance.\r\n\r\nI have to add this on behalf of his Majesty's Government: We cannot\r\nregard this as in any sense a satisfactory communication. We have, in\r\nreply to it, repeated the request we made last week to the German\r\nGovernment, that they should give us the same assurance in regard to\r\nBelgian neutrality as was given to us and to Belgium by France last\r\nweek. We have asked that a reply to that request and a satisfactory\r\nanswer to the telegram of this morning--which I have read to the\r\nHouse--should be given before midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPENETRATION OF BELGIAN TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nStatement by Prime Minister Asquith in House of Commons, Aug. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bonar Law_--May I ask the Prime Minister if he has any information\r\nhe can give us today?\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister_--Our Ambassador at Berlin received his passports at\r\n7 o'clock last evening and since 11 o'clock last night a state of war\r\nhas existed between Germany and ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe have received from our Minister at Brussels the following telegram:\r\n\r\n     I have just received from Minister for Foreign Affairs [that is the\r\n     Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs] a note of which the following\r\n     is a literal translation:\r\n\r\n        \"Belgian Government regret to have to inform his\r\n        Majesty's Government that this morning armed\r\n        forces of Germany penetrated into Belgian\r\n        territory in violation of engagements assumed by\r\n        treaty.\r\n\r\n        Belgian Government are further resolved to resist\r\n        by all means in their power.\r\n\r\n        Belgium appeals to Great Britain and France and\r\n        Russia to co-operate, as guarantors in defense of\r\n        her territory.\r\n\r\n        There would be concerted and common action with\r\n        the object of resisting the forcible measures\r\n        employed by Germany against Belgium, and at the\r\n        same time of guarding the maintenance for future\r\n        of the independence and integrity of Belgium.\r\n\r\n        Belgium is happy to be able to declare that she\r\n        will assume defense of her fortified places.\"\r\n\r\nWe have also received today from the French Ambassador here the\r\nfollowing telegram received by the French Government from the French\r\nMinister at Brussels:\r\n\r\n     The Chef du Cabinet of the Belgian Ministry of War has asked the\r\n     French Military Attaché to prepare at once for the co-operation and\r\n     contact of French troops with the Belgian Army pending the results\r\n     of the appeal to the guaranteeing powers now being made. Orders\r\n     have, therefore, been given to Belgian Provincial Governors not to\r\n     regard movements of French troops as a violation of the frontier.\r\n\r\nThis is all the information I am at the moment able to give to the\r\nHouse, but I take the opportunity of giving notice that tomorrow, in\r\nCommittee of Supply, I shall move a vote of credit of £100,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Britain's Mobilization\r\n\r\nMeasures Taken Throughout the Empire Upon the Outbreak of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMessage from King George V. to the House of Commons, Aug. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Asquith_ then proceeded to the bar amid cheers and, on being called\r\nupon by the Speaker, announced: A message from his Majesty signed by his\r\nown hand. The announcement was received with loud cheers, which were\r\ncontinued as Mr. Asquith advanced up the floor and handed the document\r\nto the Speaker. All the members uncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Speaker_ read the message as follows:\r\n\r\n     The present state of public affairs in Europe constituting in the\r\n     opinion of his Majesty a case of great emergency within the meaning\r\n     of the acts of Parliament in that behalf, his Majesty deems it\r\n     proper to provide additional means for the military service and,\r\n     therefore, in pursuance of these acts his Majesty has thought it\r\n     right to communicate to the House of Commons that his Majesty is by\r\n     proclamation about to order that the army reserve shall be called\r\n     out on permanent service, that soldiers who would otherwise be\r\n     entitled in pursuance of the terms of their enlistment to be\r\n     transferred to the reserve shall continue in army service for such\r\n     period not exceeding the period for which they might be required to\r\n     serve if they were transferred to the reserve and called out for\r\n     permanent service as to his Majesty may seem expedient; and that\r\n     such directions as may seem necessary may be given for embodying\r\n     the territorial force and for making such special arrangements as\r\n     may be proper with regard to units or individuals whose services\r\n     may be required in other than a military capacity.--Signed by his\r\n     Majesty in his own hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKING TO BRITAIN'S FLEET.\r\n\r\nMessage from George V. to Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, Aug. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this grave moment in our national history I send to you, and through\r\nyou to the officers and men of the fleets of which you have assumed\r\ncommand, the assurance of my confidence that under your direction they\r\nwill revive and renew the old glories of the royal navy, and prove once\r\nagain the sure shield of Britain and of her empire in the hour of trial.\r\n\r\nGEORGE R. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPOLEONISM ONCE AGAIN.\r\n\r\nSpeech by Bonar Law, Opposition Leader, in House of Commons, Aug. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Minister has ever fulfilled a duty more responsible or in regard to\r\nwhich the responsibility was more acutely felt than that which has just\r\nbeen fulfilled by the right honorable gentleman. This is not a time for\r\nspeech-making, and I should have been quite ready to leave the statement\r\nwhich he has given to the committee as the expression of the view, not\r\nof a party, but of a nation. [Cheers.] But as this, I think, will be the\r\nonly opportunity which will be given for expressing the views of a large\r\nsection of this House, I feel that I am bound to make it clear to the\r\ncommittee and to the country what is the attitude of his Majesty's\r\nOpposition on this question. There are two things which I desire to\r\nimpress upon the committee. The first is that we have dreaded war and\r\nhave longed for peace as strongly as any section of this committee; and\r\nthe second is that in our belief we are in a state of war against our\r\nwill, and that we, as a nation, have done everything in our power to\r\nprevent such a condition of things arising. [Cheers.] When this crisis\r\nfirst arose I confess that I was one of those who had the impulse to\r\nhope that even though a European conflagration took place we might be\r\nable to stay out. I had that hope strongly. But in a short time I became\r\nconvinced that into this war we should inevitably be drawn and that it\r\nreally was a question only whether we should enter it honorably or be\r\ndragged into it with dishonor. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nFolly and Wickedness.\r\n\r\nI remember that on the first occasion after the retirement of my right\r\nhonorable friend (Mr. Balfour) when I had to speak on foreign affairs I\r\nmade this statement. It perhaps is wrong, though I do not think so even\r\nyet. I said that if ever war arose between Great Britain and Germany it\r\nwould not be due to inevitable causes, for I did not believe in an\r\ninevitable war, but it would be due to human folly. [Cheers.] It is due\r\nto human folly and to human wickedness [cheers], but neither the folly\r\nnor the wickedness is here. [Cheers.] What other course was open to us?\r\nIt is quite true, as the Foreign Secretary explained to the House the\r\nother day, that we were under no formal obligations to take part in such\r\na struggle. But every member in this House knows that the entente meant\r\nthis in the minds of this Government and of every other Government, that\r\nif any of the three powers were attacked aggressively the others would\r\nbe expected to step in and to give their aid. [\"Hear, hear!\"] The\r\nquestion, therefore, to my mind was this: Was this war in any way\r\nprovoked by those who will now be our allies? No one who has read the\r\n\"White Paper\" can hesitate to answer that question. I am not going to go\r\ninto it even as fully as the Prime Minister has done; but I would remind\r\nthe House of this, that in this \"White Paper\" is contained a statement\r\nmade by the German Ambassador, I think at Vienna, that Russia was not in\r\na condition and could not go to war. And in the same letter are found\r\nthese words: \"As for Germany, she knew very well what she was about in\r\nbacking up Austria-Hungary in this matter.\" Now, every one for years has\r\nknown that the key to peace or war lay in Berlin, and at this crisis no\r\none doubts that Berlin, if it had chosen, could have prevented this\r\nterrible conflict. [Cheers.] I am afraid that the miscalculation which\r\nwas made about Russia was made also about us. The dispatch which the\r\nright honorable gentleman referred to is a dispatch of a nature which I\r\nbelieve would not have been addressed to Great Britain if it had been\r\nbelieved that our hands were free and that we held the position which we\r\nhad always held before the entente. That, at least, is my belief.\r\n\r\nNapoleonism Without a Napoleon.\r\n\r\nWe are fighting, as the Prime Minister said, for the honor and, what\r\nwith the honor is bound up always, the interest of our nation. But we\r\nare fighting also for the whole basis of the civilization for which we\r\nstand and for which Europe stands. [Cheers.] I do not wish, any more\r\nthan the Prime Minister, to inflame passion. I only ask the House to\r\nconsider one aspect. Look at the way Belgium is being treated today.\r\nThere is a report--if it is not true now it may be true tomorrow--that\r\nthe City of Liége is invaded by German troops and that civilians, as in\r\nthe days of the Middle Ages, are fighting for their hearths and homes\r\nagainst trained troops. How has that been brought about? In a state of\r\nwar, war must be waged. But remember that this plan is not of today or\r\nof yesterday; that it has been long matured; that the Germans knew that\r\nthey would have this to face; and that they were ready to take the\r\ncourse which they took the other day of saying to Belgium, \"Destroy your\r\nindependence. Allow our troops to go through, or we will come down upon\r\nyou with a might which it is impossible for you to resist.\" If we had\r\nallowed that to be done, our position as one of the great nations of the\r\nworld and our honor as one of the nations of the world would in my\r\nopinion have been gone forever. [Cheers.] This is no small struggle. It\r\nis the greatest, perhaps, that this country has ever engaged in. It is\r\nNapoleonism once again. [\"Hear, hear!\"] Thank Heaven, so far as we know,\r\nthere is no Napoleon.\r\n\r\nI am not going to say anything more about the causes of the war, for I\r\ndo not desire to encourage controversy on this subject. But if I may be\r\nallowed to say so, I should like to say that I read yesterday with real\r\npleasure an article in a paper which does not generally commend itself\r\nto me--The Manchester Guardian. [\"Hear, hear!\"] In that article it still\r\nheld that the war ought not to have been entered upon; but it took this\r\nview, that that was a question for history, and that now we are in it\r\nthere is only one question for us, and that is to bring it to a\r\nsuccessful issue. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nSir, I have full sympathy far more than at any other time for the Prime\r\nMinister and the Foreign Secretary. I can imagine nothing more terrible\r\nthan that the Foreign Secretary should have a feeling that perhaps he\r\nhas brought his country into an unnecessary war. No feeling could be\r\nworse. I can say this, and, whether we are right or wrong, the whole\r\nHouse agrees with it, I am sure, that that is a burden which the right\r\nhonorable gentleman can carry with a good conscience, [cheers,] and that\r\nevery one of us can put up unhesitatingly this prayer: \"May God defend\r\nthe right.\"\r\n\r\nTrade and Food Supplies.\r\n\r\nI should like, if I may, to pass to another topic, for this is the only\r\nopportunity I can have. Consider the conditions under which this war is\r\ngoing to be carried on. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister say the\r\nother day in answer to a speech of the honorable member for Merthyr\r\nTydvil--he has developed it in describing the terms of this vote of\r\ncredit--that he realized, as we all must realize, that in a country\r\nsituated like ours the development of industry and the supply of food at\r\nhome is just as much an operation of war as the conduct of our armed\r\nforces. [Cheers.] I do not wish to minimize our difficulties, but I am\r\nquite sure--as sure as I can be of anything--that there is no danger of\r\na scarcity of food. [\"Hear, hear!\"] The only danger is the fear of a\r\nscarcity of food. [\"Hear, hear!\"] Every one who has been in business\r\nknows that what causes panic prices is not an actual scarcity at the\r\ntime, but a fear of scarcity coming. This is a case where every one of\r\nus must do all he can to impress upon the people of this country that\r\nthere is, as I believe, no danger. [Cheers.] Here I should like to give\r\none warning note. Remember--at least I believe it--that this war,\r\nunexpected by us, is not unexpected by our enemies; and I shall be\r\ngreatly surprised if we do not find that at first on our trade routes\r\nthere is a destruction of our property which might create a panic. That\r\nis inevitable, I think, at the outset. Let us be prepared for it, and\r\nlet us realize that it has no bearing whatever on the ultimate course of\r\nthe war. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThere is something else which I think it is important to say. We had a\r\ndiscussion yesterday about credit. That is the basis of a successful\r\nwar, as it is of every branch of industry at this moment. I think the\r\nGovernment have taken the right course. I have followed it closely, and\r\nI know that they have been supported by those who best understand the\r\nsituation. I think the danger is minimized as much as it can be. But,\r\nafter all, the question of credit really depends on what we believe is\r\ngoing to be the effect of this war upon our trade and our industry.\r\n\r\nThe Command of the Sea.\r\n\r\nI hope the House will not think that I am too optimistic, but I do think\r\nthere is a danger of our taking too gloomy a view of what the effects\r\nwill be, [\"Hear, hear!\"] and, by taking that gloomy view, helping to\r\nbring about the very state of things which we all desire to avert. Again\r\nI wish to guard myself against seeming to be too hopeful; but let us\r\nlook at the effect as if we were examining a chess problem. If we keep\r\nthe command of the sea, what is going to happen? It all depends on that.\r\nI admit that if that goes the position is gloomy indeed; but of that I\r\nhave no fear. [Cheers.] If we keep the command of the sea what is going\r\nto happen? Five-sixths of our production is employed in the home trade.\r\nWhat goes abroad is very important, and, of course, if the population\r\nwhich supplies this one-sixth were thrown out of work that would react\r\non the whole. But, after all, the total amount of our exports to all the\r\nEuropean countries which are now at war is only a small part of our\r\ntotal exports. There is here no question of fiscal policy. We are far\r\nbeyond that. It is a question of fact. Our total exports to all the\r\ncountries which are now at war do not, in my belief--I have not looked\r\ninto the figures--exceed our exports to India and Australia taken alone.\r\nNow, consider this, we shall have freedom of trade, if the command of\r\nthe sea is maintained, with the colonies and with the whole of the\r\nAmerican Continent, while, unfortunately for them, both our allies and\r\nour enemies will not be competing with us in these markets. Look at it\r\nas a problem. I think we have a right to believe, not that trade will be\r\ngood, but that it will be much more nearly normal than is generally\r\nsupposed. [Cheers.] I hope the House will not think that that is a\r\nuseless thing to say at such a time. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThere is one thing more only I wish to say. This is the affair of the\r\nnation. Every one would desire to help. There will be a great deal of\r\nwork to be done which cannot be done by the Government. I was glad the\r\nPrime Minister has already asked the co-operation of my right honorable\r\nfriends the members for West Birmingham and the Strand. They gladly\r\ncame. But I am sure I speak not for this bench but for the whole of our\r\nparty when I say that the Government has only got to requisition any one\r\nof us and we will serve them and our country to the best of our ability.\r\n[Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPACT OF TRIPLE ENTENTE.\r\n\r\nStatement Issued by British Foreign Office, Sept. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe undersigned duly authorized thereto by the respective Governments\r\nhereby declare as follows:\r\n\r\nThe British, French, and Russian Governments mutually engage not to\r\nconclude peace separately during the present war.

GREY, his Britannic Majesty's\r\n                   Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n                   PAUL CAMBON, Ambassador Extraordinary\r\n                   and Plenipotentiary of the French Republic.\r\n\r\n                   BENCKENDORFF, Ambassador Extraordinary\r\n                   and Plenipotentiary of his\r\n                   Majesty the Emperor of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COUNTERSTROKE.\r\n\r\nSemi-Official Statement in The London Times, Sept. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe declaration of the Allied Governments that they will not conclude\r\npeace separately during the war or demand terms of peace without\r\nprevious agreement with each other is an opportune counterstroke to the\r\ncampaign initiated by Germany for the purpose of detaching France from\r\nRussia and especially from Britain. Overtures in this sense have\r\ndoubtless been made to France.\r\n\r\nThe German Government has not yet realized the strength of the moral\r\nforces it has ranged against itself by its wanton attack upon European\r\ncivilization. It appears to imagine that, after having been sufficiently\r\n\"punished\" for her temerity in opposing the Kaiser's hosts, France would\r\nbe open to a bargain, under which she would be \"let off\" lightly on\r\ncondition that she should agree to become the ally of Germany.\r\n\r\nThis idea has been clearly expressed of late in the German press. It is\r\nbased on the belief that the war was prepared by skillful British\r\nintrigues inspired by jealousy of Germany. German statesmen cannot\r\nconceive that nations should fight for any cause loftier than material\r\n\"interests.\" Hence the constant mistakes of their diplomacy and its\r\nfailure to foresee that little Belgium would resist German pretensions\r\nor that England would go to war for \"a scrap of paper.\" Now they imagine\r\nthat the determination of France to fight to the last in defense of her\r\nhonor and her superior civilization can be undermined by an offer to\r\nmitigate the material losses she may suffer from the war.\r\n\r\nThe German view was most clearly expressed in the remarkable dispatch to\r\nthe Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant from its Berlin correspondent, which\r\nwas reproduced in The Times of yesterday. Politicians in Berlin, he\r\nwrote,\r\n\r\n     see in England the land which has brought about the outbreak of the\r\n     war by finely played intrigue, in order to let dangerous Russia\r\n     bleed herself to death, to the end that against Germany, even a\r\n     victorious Germany, she may herself acquire great advantages, both\r\n     in trade and on the sea, and in order to make France entirely\r\n     dependent upon her. The consequence of this opinion is in the\r\n     highest degree remarkable. Whether you speak with a politician or\r\n     with a porter or shoemaker, the same wish will always be expressed.\r\n     We must, when we have beaten France, offer her peace on very\r\n     acceptable terms in order to make her our ally to fight--against\r\n     England.\r\n\r\nThe German error, which the declaration of the Allies should go far to\r\ncorrect, is all the more remarkable in view of the stipulations of the\r\nAustro-German Treaty of Alliance. Concluded in 1879 by Bismarck and\r\nAndrássy, this treaty still governs the relationship between Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary. Its first clause runs:\r\n\r\n     Should, contrary to the hope and against the sincere wish of the\r\n     two high contracting parties, one of the two empires be attacked by\r\n     Russia, the high contracting parties are bound to stand by each\r\n     other with the whole of the armed forces of their empires, and, _in\r\n     consequence thereof, only to conclude peace jointly and in\r\n     agreement_.\r\n\r\nHowever low the German estimate of the moral cohesion of France, Russia,\r\nand England, German statesmen must be singularly lacking in shrewdness\r\nif they suppose the Allies to be less alive than were Bismarck and\r\nAndrássy to the need for complete co-operation between allies, not only\r\nin war, but also in the negotiation of peace.\r\n\r\nThe futile German campaign for the detachment of France from her allies\r\nis, indeed, the most striking indication yet forthcoming of the\r\nmisgivings with which the resolute action of the Allies is beginning to\r\ninspire the Kaiser and his Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL MESSAGE TO THE BRITISH DOMINIONS.\r\n\r\nKing George V. to the Self-Governing Peoples and the Empire of India,\r\nSept. 9, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Governments and Peoples of my Self-Governing Dominions: During\r\nthe past few weeks the peoples of my whole empire at home and overseas\r\nhave moved with one mind and purpose to confront and overthrow an\r\nunparalleled assault upon the continuity of civilization and the peace\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nThe calamitous conflict is not of my seeking, my voice has been cast\r\nthroughout on the side of peace. My Ministers earnestly strove to allay\r\nthe causes of strife and to appease differences with which my empire was\r\nnot concerned. Had I stood aside when, in defiance of pledges to which\r\nmy kingdom was a party, the soil of Belgium was violated and her cities\r\nlaid desolate, when the very life of the French Nation was threatened\r\nwith extinction, I should have sacrificed my honor and given to\r\ndestruction the liberties of my empire and of mankind. I rejoice that\r\nevery part of the empire is with me in this decision.\r\n\r\nParamount regard for treaty faith and the pledged word of rulers and\r\npeoples is the common heritage of Great Britain and of the empire.\r\n\r\nMy peoples in the self-governing dominions have shown beyond all doubt\r\nthat they wholeheartedly indorse the grave decision which it was\r\nnecessary to take.\r\n\r\nMy personal knowledge of the loyalty and devotion of my oversea\r\ndominions had led me to expect that they would cheerfully make the great\r\nefforts and bear the great sacrifices which the present conflict\r\nentails. The full measure in which they have placed their services and\r\nresources at my disposal fills me with gratitude and I am proud to be\r\nable to show to the world that my peoples oversea are as determined as\r\nthe people of the United Kingdom to prosecute a just cause to a\r\nsuccessful end.\r\n\r\nThe Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Dominion\r\nof New Zealand have placed at my disposal their naval forces, which have\r\nalready rendered good service for the empire. Strong expeditionary\r\nforces are being prepared in Canada, in Australia, and in New Zealand\r\nfor service at the front, and the Union of South Africa has released all\r\nBritish troops and has undertaken important military responsibilities\r\nthe discharge of which will be of the utmost value to the empire.\r\nNewfoundland has doubled the numbers of its branch of the royal naval\r\nreserve and is sending a body of men to take part in the operations at\r\nthe front. From the Dominion and Provincial Governments of Canada large\r\nand welcome gifts of supplies are on their way for the use both of my\r\nnaval and military forces and for the relief of the distress in the\r\nUnited Kingdom which must inevitably follow in the wake of war. All\r\nparts of my oversea dominions have thus demonstrated in the most\r\nunmistakable manner the fundamental unity of the empire amid all its\r\ndiversity of situation and circumstance.\r\n\r\nMessage to India.\r\n\r\nTo the Princes and peoples of my Indian Empire: Among the many incidents\r\nthat have marked the unanimous uprising of the populations of my empire\r\nin defense of its unity and integrity, nothing has moved me more than\r\nthe passionate devotion to my throne expressed both by my Indian\r\nsubjects and by the Feudatory Princes and the ruling chiefs of India,\r\nand their prodigal offers of their lives and their resources in the\r\ncause of the realm. Their one-voiced demand to be foremost in the\r\nconflict has touched my heart, and has inspired to the highest issues\r\nthe love and devotion which, as I well know, have ever linked my Indian\r\nsubjects and myself. I recall to mind India's gracious message to the\r\nBritish Nation of good-will and fellowship which greeted my return in\r\nFebruary, 1912, after the solemn ceremony of my Coronation Durbar at\r\nDelhi, and I find in this hour of trial a full harvest and a noble\r\nfulfillment of the assurance given by you that the destinies of Great\r\nBritain and India are indissolubly linked.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n438,000 MEN RECRUITED.\r\n\r\nStatements in House of Commons, Sept. 10, by Prime Minister Asquith and\r\nBonar Law.\r\n\r\nThe House went into Committee of Supply, Mr. Whitley in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n     On the question that an additional number of land forces not\r\n     exceeding 500,000 of all ranks be maintained for the service of the\r\n     United Kingdom, in consequence of the war in Europe, for the year\r\n     ending March 31, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Asquith_ (Fife E.) said: The House of Commons voted earlier in the\r\nsession, before any outbreak of war was anticipated, under normal\r\nconditions, under Vote A, 186,000-odd men for the regular army. It is\r\nperhaps not necessary to point out, but it may be convenient to put it\r\non record, that the total number of men under Vote A does not include\r\neither the army reserve, the special reserve, or the territorial forces.\r\nWhen we come to vote the financial provision under Vote 1 of the army\r\nestimates, which is consequential upon the passing of Vote A, we make\r\nprovision not only for the 186,000 men already sanctioned for the\r\nregular army, but also for the army reserve. In the subsequent Votes 3\r\nand 4 provision is made for the special reserve and territorial force.\r\nThe army reserve and the special reserve are not called upon to serve\r\nuntil, under regular constitutional machinery, consequent upon the\r\noutbreak or imminence of war, they are summoned to do so. It may be\r\nconvenient to the committee to know that at the time when war broke out\r\nand when the reserves were called to the colors the state of things was\r\nthis: Parliament had voted 186,000-odd men--call it roughly 200,000. The\r\narmy reserve and the special reserve then became available as part of\r\nthe regular forces of the country, amounting also roughly to another\r\n200,000 men. That was altogether 400,000 men. On Aug. 6, after war had\r\nbeen declared, I made a motion in committee which was assented to in\r\ncommittee and by the House on report, for the addition of 500,000 men to\r\nthe regular forces. These 500,000 men, assuming them all to have been\r\nraised, would, in addition to the 400,000 I have just mentioned, amount\r\nto a total of 900,000 men. I think it will be interesting to the\r\ncommittee before I state the reasons for which I am going to ask them to\r\nmake this further vote to know what has actually happened in consequence\r\nof the vote of Aug. 6.\r\n\r\nEnlistments Since the War.\r\n\r\nThe number of recruits who have enlisted in the army since the\r\ndeclaration of war--that is, exclusive of those who have joined the\r\nterritorial force--is 438,000, [cheers,] practically 439,000. That is up\r\nto the evening of Sept. 9. The committee will therefore see that, having\r\nsanctioned, as it did, very little more than a month ago, the addition\r\nto the regular forces of the Crown of half a million of men, we are now\r\nwithin some 60,000 of having attained that total. The numbers enlisted\r\nin London since Sunday, Aug. 30, have exceeded 30,000 men, and the stamp\r\nand character of the recruits has been in every way satisfactory and\r\ngratifying. [Cheers.] The high-water mark was reached on Sept. 3, when\r\nthe total recruits enlisted in the United Kingdom on one day was 33,204.\r\n[Cheers.] I may mention--I am sure it will be gratifying to honorable\r\nmembers on both sides who represent Lancashire constituencies--that on\r\nthat day 2,151 men were enlisted in Manchester alone. That is a very\r\nsatisfactory result, but it by no means exhausts the requirements of the\r\ncase. The response to the call for recruits has been in every way\r\ngratifying. But I am aware, not only from a discussion that took place\r\nin the House yesterday, but from communications which reached us from\r\nvarious parts of the country, that there are complaints of grievances,\r\ncausing legitimate or otherwise deeply felt dissatisfaction at the\r\nmanner in which some parts--I say advisedly only some parts--of this\r\noperation of recruiting have been conducted. I should like the\r\ncommittee to realize what were the conditions of the case. [\"Hear,\r\nhear!\"]\r\n\r\nA Year's Recruits in a Day.\r\n\r\nWe have been recruiting during the last ten days every day substantially\r\nthe same number of recruits that in past years we have recruited in\r\nevery year. [Cheers.] I suppose our annual recruiting amounts to about\r\n35,000 men for the regular army. As I pointed out a moment ago, on Sept.\r\n3 we recruited 33,200 men. No machinery in the world which man has ever\r\ncontrived or conceived could suddenly meet in an emergency and under\r\ngreat pressure the difficulty of bringing in to the colors and making\r\nadequate provision in a day for that in which past experience we only\r\nhad to provide for in the course of a year, and that, be it observed, by\r\na department which during the whole of this time has been engaged in\r\nsuperintending and executing an operation I believe unexampled in the\r\nhistory of war--the dispatch to a foreign country of an expeditionary\r\nforce--I will not give the exact number, but roughly 150,000 men, which\r\nhas had to be, as the committee I am sure is well aware, in consequence\r\nof the necessary and regrettable losses caused by the operations of war,\r\nconstantly repaired by reinforcements of men, guns, supplies, transport,\r\nand every other form of warlike material. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nWar Office's Double Task.\r\n\r\nIf our critics--I do not complain of legitimate criticism even at times\r\nlike this--but if they will try to imagine themselves equipped with the\r\nmachinery which was possessed by the War Office at the time the war\r\nbroke out, and then consider that side by side with the smooth,\r\nfrictionless, and most successful dispatch of the expeditionary force\r\n[cheers] which left these shores and arrived at its destination--I am\r\nspeaking the literal truth--without the loss of a horse or a man,\r\n[cheers,] the wastage day by day and week by week has had to be repaired\r\nin men and in material, repaired often at a moment's notice, and it has\r\nbeen necessary to keep constantly in reserve, and not only in reserve,\r\nbut ready for immediate use, the material to replace further wastage as\r\ndays and weeks rolled on--if you remember that that was the primary call\r\non the War Office, and that side by side with that they had to provide\r\nfor recruits in these few weeks of no less than 430,000 men, he will be\r\na very censorious, and, I venture to say, a very unpatriotic, critic who\r\nwould make much of small difficulties and friction and who would not\r\nrecognize that in a great emergency this department has played a worthy\r\npart. [Cheers.] My tenure at the War Office was a brief one, but no one\r\nwho has ever had the honor to preside over that department can possibly\r\nexaggerate the degree of efficiency to which it has been brought under\r\nthe administration of recent years. Everything, as the experience of\r\nthis war has shown, was foreseen and provided for in advance with the\r\nsingle exception of the necessity of this enormous increase in our\r\nregular forces.\r\n\r\nSteps for Dealing with Recruits.\r\n\r\nWhat provision has been made for dealing with this influx of recruits?\r\nIn the first place, and I think very wisely, my noble friend the\r\nSecretary of State for War appealed for the assistance of the county\r\nassociations, which rendered such great and patriotic services in\r\nconnection with the territorial forces. The great bulk of these county\r\nassociations have responded to the call and enormously facilitated the\r\nwork of providing for this large body of new recruits. Next, he, in\r\nconjunction with his advisers, has largely multiplied, and is continuing\r\nto multiply, the various training centres. There has been--unfortunately,\r\nno one can deny that there has been--a congestion of men ready and\r\nwilling to recruit and actually enlisting at particular places which\r\nhas produced, for the moment at any rate, a certain amount of\r\ndiscomfort and a certain amount of difficulty in the provision of food\r\nand all the other requirements of such a body. But in that connection I\r\nshould like, although I think the difficulty is now being almost got\r\nover, to make an appeal strongly to local authorities--county councils,\r\ntown councils, urban and rural district councils--that when a situation\r\nof this kind arises in consequence of a national necessity they should\r\nshow themselves--and I am sure they are most willing to do so--not only\r\nzealous, but able to provide accommodation for the moment in the public\r\nbuildings which are under their charge. I think a great deal of the\r\ncongestion which has taken place could have been avoided if more\r\nliberal use had been made, and could be made--I am not reproaching any\r\none: the circumstances were exceptional and the pressure very great on\r\nour public buildings, our town halls, schools, and the other edifices\r\nwhich are under the control of municipal and county authorities for the\r\npurpose, at any rate at the moment, of relieving the great pressure of\r\nrecruiting, and I am quite sure that appeal will not go unheeded. But\r\nwe recognize fully, and no one more fully than my noble friend Lord\r\nKitchener, the necessity of facilitating this process and rendering it\r\nmore easy. We do not think the time has come in which we ought in any\r\nway to relax our recruiting efforts, [cheers,] and when people tell me,\r\nas they do every day, \"These recruits are coming in in their tens of\r\nthousands; you are being blocked by them and you cannot provide\r\nadequately either for their equipment or for their training,\" my answer\r\nis, \"We shall want more rather than less, and let us get the men,\"\r\n[Cheers.] That is the first necessity of the State--let us get the men.\r\nKnowing as we all do the patriotic spirit which now, as always--now, of\r\ncourse, with increased emphasis and enthusiasm--animates every class of\r\nthe community, I am perfectly certain they will be ready to endure\r\nhardship and discomforts for the moment if they are satisfied that\r\ntheir services are really required by the State, and that in due course\r\nof time they will be supplied with adequate provision for training and\r\nequipment and for rendering themselves fit for taking their places in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nTwo Important Steps.\r\n\r\nWith that object a few days ago--and the process is now in complete\r\noperation--a very important step was taken which I am sure will be\r\ngenerally welcomed by the committee and by the country--whenever it is\r\nnecessary to allow men who are recruited and have gone through the\r\nprocess of attestation, medical examination, and actual enrollment, so\r\nthat they are not only potential but actual members of the regular\r\narmy--to allow these men to go back to their own homes until the\r\noccasion arises for them to be called upon for actual training. In that\r\nway we hope to relieve--indeed relief has already been given and will be\r\ngiven more amply in the near future--the undoubted block and congestion\r\nwhich have taken place in certain districts to the natural\r\ndisappointment of the men who have come forward under an impulse of\r\npublic duty to serve their country and, finding themselves sent back\r\nhome and put for the time being in the reserve, have felt perhaps that\r\ntheir services were not duly appreciated by the country. That, I think,\r\nthe committee will agree is a very important step in advance. I have to\r\nannounce another step which I believe will give universal satisfaction\r\nand will go a long way to solve the practical difficulty, such as it is.\r\nWe propose from today that there shall be given to those recruits for\r\nwhom we are unable to find accommodation for the time being 3s. per day.\r\n[Cheers.] This is not an extravagant proposal, or anything in the nature\r\nof a bribe. A shilling a day is their pay. [An Honorable Member--1s.\r\n3d.] I am speaking in round figures; we will call it a shilling. Then if\r\nwe take the value of what we may roughly call the board and lodging of a\r\nsoldier receiving 1s. a day when accommodated in barracks and price that\r\nat 2s., I do not think you are putting it extravagantly high. We think\r\nthat these men who have come forward to join the colors and have been\r\nactually enrolled, and are, in fact, members of the regular army, for\r\nwhom we cannot make immediate provision by way of accommodation, should\r\nbe no worse off than they would be if they were actually in barracks. I\r\nbelieve the provision of that 3s. a day for these men will put them in\r\na position in which they are entitled to say that they have not been\r\nprejudiced or penalized by their patriotic desires.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lawson_ (Mile End, Opp.)--And their return railway fares?\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Honorable Member--_And their separation allowances?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Asquith_--The separation allowance does not begin, but as the\r\nhonorable member has interjected that phrase I will add--because\r\nhonorable members generally have been very good in not pressing us in\r\nregard to the separation allowances to soldiers who are actually\r\nserving--that that matter is receiving our daily and constant\r\nconsideration, and I hope before the session comes to an end to be able\r\nto make a further announcement. But it does not arise with regard to\r\nthis vote. Having made that defense, if defense were needed--I do not\r\nthink it was--having made that statement of what has actually been done\r\nby the War Office in these very anxious days, and also having indicated\r\nthat in those two important respects we are endeavoring to facilitate\r\nthe process of recruitment and to remove any possibility of hardship,\r\neither to the individual recruit or to recruits collectively, I hope the\r\ncommittee will agree to pass a vote for another 500,000 men. I am\r\nperfectly certain if they do so the response will be no less keen--keen\r\nin spirit--and no less ample in scale than it has been in the days which\r\nhave just gone by.\r\n\r\nAn Army of 1,200,000.\r\n\r\nWe shall then be in a position, as is apparent from the figures I have\r\nalready read, to put something like--I am not giving exact\r\nfigures--something like 1,200,000 men in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Long_ (Strand)--Does that include the Indians?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Asquith_--No, it is entirely exclusive of them. This is the\r\nprovision made by the mother country. And of course it is exclusive of\r\nthe territorials.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. F. Hall_--And of the national reserve?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Asquith_--Exclusive of the territorials, exclusive of the national\r\nreserve, and exclusive of the magnificent contributions promised from\r\nIndia and from our dominions, we here in these islands, this mother\r\ncountry, will be in a position to put into the field, enrolled as our\r\nregular army, something like 1,200,000 men. That is an effort which it\r\nis worth while making great sacrifices to attain. As regards money, I am\r\nperfectly certain that this House will be ready, willing, and even eager\r\nto grant it, if and when the occasion arises. What we want now is to\r\nmake it clear, to those who are showing all over the kingdom this\r\npatriotic desire to assist their country in one of the most supreme and\r\nmomentous crises in the whole of its long history, that they are not\r\ngoing to be treated either in a niggardly or unaccommodating spirit; but\r\nthat they are going to be welcomed and that every possible provision is\r\ngoing to be made for their comfort and well-being, so that under the\r\nbest possible conditions they will take their place and play their part\r\nin that magnificent army of ours which, as every one who has read the\r\nmoving dispatch Sir John French [cheers] published this morning, will\r\nrealize has never done its work better, never shown itself more worthy\r\nof long centuries of splendid tradition than in the last fortnight.\r\n[Cheers.] I ask the House to pass this vote for 500,000 men.\r\n\r\nBonar Law's Support.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bonar Law_--The right honorable gentleman in the statement he has\r\njust made has left me nothing to say except to express our hearty\r\nsupport of all the measures which the Government are taking in this\r\ncrisis. From the point of view of the Government and of this House we\r\nwelcome the putting down of this vote as showing that both the\r\nGovernment and the House of Commons are determined, whatever the cost,\r\nwhatever the sacrifice, to see this thing through. [Cheers.] I agree\r\nentirely with the words which I heard the Prime Minister use in another\r\nplace the other day, that in what has taken place so far we have every\r\nground for encouragement and every reason for pride in what is being\r\ndone by our troops. I agree entirely with what the Prime Minister has\r\nsaid about the action of our soldiers on the field of battle. It does\r\nnot surprise us. We knew that the old spirit was there still. But I\r\nthink it has to some extent at least surprised our enemies. But while we\r\nhave reason to be gratified by the action which the Government has taken\r\nand which this House has supported them in taking, I think as a nation\r\nwe have quite as much reason to be proud of the spirit which is shown by\r\nour countrymen in rushing to the standard as we have even in what has\r\nbeen done by our soldiers on the field of battle. I never sympathized\r\nwith--I always resented--the view expressed at one time that our\r\ncitizens were holding back. There was no justification for it. [Cheers.]\r\nAt the outset they did not realize what it meant, but the moment they\r\ndid realize it they have shown that they are prepared to do their share\r\nto fight the battles of their country. I am not going to say anything\r\nabout the difficulties in connection with recruiting this great force to\r\nwhich the Prime Minister has referred. No one could have doubted that\r\ndifficulties of that kind would arise and that hardships would occur.\r\nCriticism, I am sure, is not deprecated by the right honorable\r\ngentleman, and ought not to be, if it is framed entirely with this\r\nview--to make sure that everything that can be done is being done to\r\nminimize the hardships and difficulties with which the authorities were\r\nconfronted. As the Prime Minister said, the machine was not framed to\r\ndeal with an emergency like this. No one could expect it to deal with it\r\nsmoothly. But we have a right to expect that the difficulties are\r\nunderstood at the War Office, and we have the right also to ask that\r\nsince they cannot be met by the central machine, every effort should be\r\nmade in the direction of devolution, and that the difficulties shall be\r\nmet where they locally arise. I am sure it is a satisfaction to the\r\nHouse, as it was to me, to find that before the discussion arose\r\nyesterday not only had Lord Kitchener realized the difficulties, but\r\nthat he had taken every step possible to meet them, and that the step\r\nwhich he did take was in the direction, which we all feel is a wise one,\r\nof putting the responsibility on those at a distance from the War Office\r\nand expecting them to bear it. Many of us have been asked to take part\r\nin helping the recruiting. When I was asked to join in this I had in my\r\nmind the feeling to which I gave expression the other day, that I was\r\nnot satisfied that too much sacrifice was not being required from those\r\nwho are going to fight our battles and that a full share of sacrifice\r\nwas being borne by those who remain behind. Nothing could be more unfair\r\nthan that this country should expect all the sacrifice to come from the\r\nmen who are actually going to risk their lives in our behalf. [Cheers.]\r\nWe know with what splendid spirit they are coming forward. I suppose\r\nevery member of the House could give instances that would surprise us\r\nall. Perhaps it would interest the House if I give one. The son of a\r\nfriend of mine, who is well off, had been writing to the War Office,\r\ntaking every step to try to be accepted in order to fight. He was a\r\npartner in a big business in Glasgow and with splendid prospects; he\r\nthrew them all up. He came and hung about the doors of the War Office as\r\nif he was seeking some fat job, when all he wanted was to be placed, not\r\nas an officer, but as a private, in one of the most dangerous branches\r\nof the service. [Cheers.] That is a spirit which is universal. I do not\r\nsay in what way further provision should be made, but I am sure the\r\nHouse welcomes the statement of the Prime Minister that the Government\r\nare going to reconsider the whole question of separation allowances for\r\nthe families of the men and for the pensions. I am sure I am expressing\r\nthe view not of our own party, but of the whole House, when I say that\r\nthe country realizes that when these men risk their lives for us they\r\nare making a big enough sacrifice, and that the country will be glad\r\nthat in every way every possible generosity at the expense of those who\r\nremain behind should be extended to those who go out to fight. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL KITCHENER'S SPEECH ON RECRUITS\r\n\r\nDelivered in the House of Lords, Sept. 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour lordships will expect that some statement should be made by me on\r\nthe general military situation before the session ends, and I will,\r\ntherefore, endeavor as briefly as possible to supplement the remarks\r\nwhich I had the honor to address to your lordships' House three weeks\r\nago.\r\n\r\nI need not retell the story of the British expeditionary force in\r\nFrance, which has been read and appreciated by us all in Sir John\r\nFrench's dispatch. The quiet restraint of his account of their\r\nachievements only brings into relief the qualities which enabled our\r\ntroops successfully to carry out the most difficult of all military\r\noperations. There is, however, one aspect of this feat of arms upon\r\nwhich the dispatch is naturally silent. I refer to the consummate skill\r\nand calm courage of the Commander in Chief himself, [cheers,] in the\r\nconduct of this strategic withdrawal in the face of vastly superior\r\nforces. His Majesty's Government appreciate to the full the value of the\r\nservice which Sir John French has rendered to this country and to the\r\ncause of the Allies, and I may perhaps be permitted here and now, on\r\ntheir behalf, to pay a tribute to his leadership, as well as to the\r\nmarked ability of the Generals under his command, and the bravery and\r\nendurance of the officers and men of the expeditionary force.\r\n\r\nThe German Retirement.\r\n\r\nAs your lordships are aware the tide has now turned, and for some days\r\npast we have received the gratifying intelligence of the forced\r\nretirement of the German armies. The latest news from Sir John French\r\ndoes not materially change the published statement describing the\r\nmilitary situation. In his telegram Sir John reports that the troops are\r\nall in good heart and are ready to move forward when the moment arrives.\r\nThe gallant French armies, with whom we are so proud to be co-operating,\r\nwill receive every support from our troops in their desire effectually\r\nto clear their country of the invading foe, and the undaunted and\r\nvigilant activity of the Belgian Army in the north materially conduces\r\nto this end. I would also like to take this opportunity of offering our\r\nrespectful congratulations to Russia upon the conspicuous successes\r\nwhich have added fresh lustre to her arms. Although, therefore, we have\r\ngood grounds for quiet confidence, it is only right that we should\r\nremind ourselves that the struggle is bound to be a long one, and that\r\nit behooves us strenuously to prosecute our labors in developing our\r\narmed forces to carry on and bring to a successful issue the mighty\r\nconflict in which we are engaged.\r\n\r\nTroops in the Field.\r\n\r\nThere are now in the field rather more than six divisions of British\r\ntroops and two cavalry divisions. These are being, and will be,\r\nmaintained at full strength by a steady flow of reinforcements. To meet\r\nthe wastage of war in this field force our reserve units are available.\r\nTo augment the expeditionary force further regular divisions and\r\nadditional cavalry are now being organized from units withdrawn from\r\noversea garrisons, whose places, where necessary, will be taken by\r\nterritorial troops, who, with fine patriotism, have volunteered to\r\nexchange a home for an imperial service obligation. On their way from\r\nIndia are certain divisions from the Indian Army, composed of highly\r\ntrained and very efficient troops, and a body of cavalry, including\r\nregiments of historic fame. The dominions beyond the seas are sending us\r\nfreely of their best. Several divisions will be available, formed of men\r\nwho have been locally trained in the light of the experience of the\r\nSouth African war, and, in the case of Australia and New Zealand, under\r\nthe system of general national training introduced a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe Call to Arms.\r\n\r\nIn the response to the call for recruits for the new armies which it is\r\nconsidered necessary to raise we have had a most remarkable\r\ndemonstration of the energy and patriotism of the young men of this\r\ncountry. We propose to organize this splendid material into four new\r\narmies, and, although it takes time to train an army, the zeal and\r\ngood-will displayed will greatly simplify our task. If some of those who\r\nhave so readily come forward have suffered inconvenience, they will not,\r\nI am sure, allow their ardor to be damped. They will reflect that the\r\nWar Office has had in a day to deal with as many recruits as were\r\nusually forthcoming in twelve months. No effort is being spared to meet\r\nthe influx of soldiers, and the War Office will do its utmost to look\r\nafter them and give them the efficient training necessary to enable them\r\nto join their comrades in the field. The divisions of the first two\r\narmies are now collected at our training centres; the third army is\r\nbeing formed on new camping grounds; the fourth army is being created by\r\nadding to the establishment of the reserve battalions, from which the\r\nunits will be detached and organized similarly to the other three\r\narmies. The whole of the special reserve and extra special reserve units\r\nwill be maintained at their full establishments as feeders to the\r\nexpeditionary force. In addition to the four new armies a considerable\r\nnumber of what may be designated local battalions have been specially\r\nraised by the public-spirited initiative of cities, towns, or\r\nindividuals. Several more are in course of formation, and I have\r\nreceived many offers of this character. The territorial force is making\r\ngreat strides in efficiency and will before many months be ready to take\r\na share in the campaign. This force is proving its military value to the\r\nempire by the willing subordination of personal feelings to the public\r\ngood in the acceptance of whatever duty may be assigned to it in any\r\nportion of the empire. A division has already left for Egypt, a brigade\r\nfor Malta, and a garrison for Gibraltar. The soldierlike qualities\r\nevinced by the force are an assurance to the Government that they may\r\ncount to the full upon its readiness to play its part wherever the\r\nexigencies of the military situation may demand. Nor must I omit to\r\nrefer to the assistance which we shall receive from the division of the\r\ngallant royal marines and bluejackets now being organized by my right\r\nhonorable friend the First Lord of the Admiralty; their presence in the\r\nfield will be very welcome, for their fighting qualities are well known.\r\n\r\nThe Supply of Officers.\r\n\r\nThe creation of the new armies referred to is fraught with considerable\r\ndifficulties, one of which is the provision of regimental officers. I\r\nhope the problem of supplying officers may be solved by the large\r\nnumbers coming forward to fill vacancies, and by promotions from the\r\nnon-commissioned officer ranks of the regular forces. In a country which\r\nprides itself on its skill in and love of outdoor sports, we ought to be\r\nable to find sufficient young men who will train and qualify as officers\r\nunder the guidance of the nucleus of trained officers which we are able\r\nto provide from India and elsewhere. If any retired officer competent to\r\ntrain troops has not yet applied or has not received an answer to a\r\nprevious application, I hope he will communicate with me at the War\r\nOffice in writing. But our chief difficulty is one of material rather\r\nthan personnel. It would not be in the public interest that I should\r\nrefer in greater detail to this question, beyond saying that strenuous\r\nendeavors are being made to cope with the unprecedented situation, and\r\nthat, thanks to the public spirit of all grades in the various\r\nindustries affected to whom we have appealed to co-operate with us, and\r\nwho are devoting all their energy to the task, our requirements will, I\r\nfeel sure, be met with all possible speed.\r\n\r\nI am confident that by the Spring we shall have ready to take the field\r\narmies which will be well trained and will prove themselves formidable\r\nopponents to the enemy. The Government fully recognize the fine spirit\r\nwhich animates those who have come forward to fight for their country,\r\nand will spare no effort to secure that everything is done that can be\r\ndone to enable them worthily to contribute to the ultimate success of\r\nour arms. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State for War concluded his speech by giving details\r\nof the increase in the separation allowances made to wives of soldiers,\r\nboth regular and territorial, which Mr. Asquith had announced in the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nTribute of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marquess of Lansdowne_--I feel that it would be almost impertinent\r\non my part to say a word after the extraordinarily interesting statement\r\nto which we have just listened. But I should be sorry if complete\r\nsilence on our part lent itself to the interpretation that we are\r\nindifferent to the great topics which the Secretary of State for War has\r\ndealt with in his speech. May we be permitted to say that we regard with\r\nthe profoundest admiration and gratitude what the noble Field Marshal\r\ndescribed as the great feat of arms which has been accomplished by the\r\nBritish force since its arrival at the seat of war, and to add also that\r\nwe share the feelings which the noble and gallant lord has expressed\r\nwith regard to the immense services rendered by Sir John French to this\r\ncountry, services which he, of course, could not bear witness to in the\r\ndispatch he sent home? [Cheers.] There are only two other remarks which,\r\nwith great deference, I would venture to make. One has reference to the\r\nnoble and gallant lord's statement in regard to the response made to his\r\nappeal to the country for recruits. That response has been memorable and\r\nadmirable and, considering the immense influx of recruits which have\r\ncome in, we can scarcely be surprised that in the early days the strain\r\nshould have been rather greater than either the War Office or the local\r\nauthorities were able to cope with. But we have every reason to believe\r\nthat that has been corrected, and I have no doubt that all will now go\r\nsmoothly and well. We have all heard with the greatest satisfaction the\r\nannouncement that the separation allowances to the wives of regulars and\r\nterritorials are to be considerably increased. [\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\nConsidering what our soldiers are doing for us at the seat of war, the\r\nleast we can do is to provide liberally for the relatives whom they have\r\nleft behind in this country. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENT PROROGUED.\r\n\r\nSpeech by King George V. Read Before Both Houses, Sept. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor read the King's speech, which was in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n     My Lords and Gentlemen: I address you in circumstances that call\r\n     for action rather than for speech.\r\n\r\n     After every endeavor had been made by my Government to preserve the\r\n     peace of the world, I was compelled, in the assertion of treaty\r\n     obligations deliberately set at nought, and for the protection of\r\n     the public law of Europe and the vital interests of my empire, to\r\n     go to war.\r\n\r\n     My navy and army have, with unceasing vigilance, courage, and\r\n     skill, sustained, in association with gallant and faithful allies,\r\n     a just and righteous cause.\r\n\r\n     From every part of my empire there has been a spontaneous and\r\n     enthusiastic rally to our common flag.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen of the House of Commons: I thank you for the liberality\r\n     with which you have met a great emergency.\r\n\r\n     My Lords and Gentlemen: We are fighting for a worthy purpose, and\r\n     we shall not lay down our arms until that purpose has been fully\r\n     achieved.\r\n\r\n     I rely with confidence upon the loyal and united efforts of all my\r\n     subjects, and I pray that Almighty God may give us His blessing.\r\n\r\nThen a commission for proroguing the Parliament was read, after which\r\nthe Lord Chancellor said:\r\n\r\n     My Lords and Gentlemen: By virtue of his Majesty's commission,\r\n     under the great seal, to us and other lords directed, and now read,\r\n     we do, in his Majesty's name and in obedience to his commands,\r\n     prorogue this Parliament to Tuesday the twenty-seventh day of\r\n     October, one thousand nine hundred and fourteen, to be then here\r\n     holden; and this Parliament is accordingly prorogued to Tuesday the\r\n     twenty-seventh day of October, one thousand nine hundred and\r\n     fourteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummons of the Nation to Arms\r\n\r\nBritish People Roused by Their Leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarl Curzon of Kedleston Suggests Holding of Public Meetings.\r\n\r\n     Hackwood, Basingstoke, Aug. 27.\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of The Times:_\r\n\r\n     Sir: Many of us are wondering what we can do to serve our country\r\n     in this crisis. We sit on local or on larger committees. We\r\n     attempt, within the narrow range of our influence, to gain\r\n     recruits, we organize relief, we help to provide or furnish\r\n     hospitals, we subscribe both to the national and to private funds;\r\n     and, apart from this, we go about our ordinary duties with as much\r\n     composure as we can, wondering where, when, and how it will be open\r\n     to us who are no longer young and cannot bear arms, but have\r\n     perhaps had some experience of affairs, to render more effective\r\n     aid.\r\n\r\n     Does not a path lie open to the class of so-called \"public men,\"\r\n     and does not the very name which is given to them indicate the\r\n     nature of this duty? Surely it is to place themselves at the\r\n     disposal of the public. The two great needs of the moment are more\r\n     men--hundreds of thousands more men--for the army, and a clearer\r\n     understanding by the masses of the population, not merely of the\r\n     justice of our cause, but of the supreme issues, both for our own\r\n     country and for the whole empire, that are involved.\r\n\r\n     No one would propose that jingo speeches should be shouted from\r\n     public platforms, or that an attempt should be made to inflame\r\n     crude or unworthy passions. But the man who, when his country is\r\n     engaged in a righteous war and is fighting for her existence,\r\n     preaches the cause of that war is not a jingo; and the passions to\r\n     which he appeals are not unworthy, but are the noblest of which\r\n     human nature is capable.\r\n\r\n     I wish, therefore, to say that if the Government, with whom the\r\n     initiative must primarily lie--since no one would wish to do\r\n     anything that is contrary to their conception of sound\r\n     policy--desire that public meetings should be held in our great\r\n     centres of population, to explain the cause and circumstances of\r\n     the war, and the duty that lies upon the manhood of the nation, I\r\n     and, I am convinced, many others are ready to throw ourselves into\r\n     the task.\r\n\r\n     I have told the Prime Minister that I would be proud to appear on a\r\n     public platform with any member of the Government to state or\r\n     defend a case in which party is dead and where we are all united. I\r\n     doubt not that if they are required many others will be willing to\r\n     do the same. We have no desire to deluge the country with a flood\r\n     of noisy rhetoric, or to start a miniature electioneering campaign.\r\n     But if in any great city where recruiting is slow or the issues are\r\n     not apprehended, or the public conscience is not quick to respond\r\n     to the national summons, I, or any of those who share my views, can\r\n     be of any service on the platform I am sure that we are willing to\r\n     respond and that we shall welcome any organization that may be set\r\n     on foot for the purpose. I am, yours obediently,\r\n\r\n     CURZON OF KEDLESTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIME MINISTER'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddressed to the Lord Mayor of London, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh,\r\nthe Lord Mayor of Dublin, and the Lord Mayor of Cardiff.\r\n\r\n\r\n     My Lords: The time has come for combined effort to stimulate and\r\n     organize public opinion and public effort in the greatest\r\n     conflict in which our people has ever been engaged.\r\n\r\n     No one who can contribute anything to the accomplishment of this\r\n     supremely urgent task is justified in standing aside.\r\n\r\n     I propose, as a first step, that meetings should be held without\r\n     delay, not only in our great centres of population and industry,\r\n     but in every district, urban and rural, throughout the United\r\n     Kingdom, at which the justice of our cause should be made plain,\r\n     and the duty of every man to do his part should be enforced.\r\n\r\n     I venture to suggest to your lordships that the four principal\r\n     cities over which you respectively preside should lead the way.\r\n\r\n     I am ready myself, so far as the exigencies of public duty\r\n     permit, to render such help as I can, and I should be glad, with\r\n     that object, to address my fellow-subjects in your cities.\r\n\r\n     I have reason to know that I can count upon the co-operation of\r\n     the leaders of every section of organized political opinion. Your\r\n     faithful servant,\r\n\r\n     H.H. ASQUITH.\r\n\r\n     28th August, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ASQUITH IN LONDON.\r\n\r\nSpeech at the Guildhall, Sept. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lord Mayor and Citizens of London: It is three and a half years since\r\nI last had the honor of addressing in this hall a gathering of the\r\ncitizens. We were then met under the Presidency of one of your\r\npredecessors, men of all creeds and parties, to celebrate and approve\r\nthe joint declaration of the two great English-speaking States that for\r\nthe future any differences between them should be settled, if not by\r\nagreement, at least by judicial inquiry and arbitration, and never in\r\nany circumstances by war. [Cheers.] Those of us who hailed that great\r\nEirenicon between the United States and ourselves as a landmark on the\r\nroad of progress were not sanguine enough to think, or even to hope,\r\nthat the era of war was drawing to a close. But still less were we\r\nprepared to anticipate the terrible spectacle which now confronts us of\r\na contest which for the number and importance of the powers engaged, the\r\nscale of their armaments and armies, the width of the theatre of\r\nconflict, the outpouring of blood and the loss of life, the incalculable\r\ntoll of suffering levied upon non-combatants, the material and moral\r\nloss accumulating day by day to the higher interests of civilized\r\nmankind--a contest which in every one of these aspects is without\r\nprecedent in the annals of the world. [\"Hear, hear!\"] We were very\r\nconfident three years ago in the rightness of our position, when we\r\nwelcomed the new securities for peace. We are equally confident in it\r\ntoday, when reluctantly, and against our will, but with a clear judgment\r\nand a clean conscience, [cheers,] we find ourselves involved with the\r\nwhole strength of this empire in a bloody arbitration between might and\r\nright [Cheers.] The issue has passed out of the domain of argument into\r\nanother field, but let me ask you, and through you the world outside,\r\nwhat would have been our condition as a nation today if we had been base\r\nenough through timidity or through perverted calculation of\r\nself-interest, or through a paralysis of the sense of honor and duty,\r\n[cheers,] if we had been base enough to be false to our word and\r\nfaithless to our friends?\r\n\r\nBlind Barbarian Vengeance.\r\n\r\nOur eyes would have been turned at this moment with those of the whole\r\ncivilized world to Belgium, a small State, which has lived for more than\r\nseventy years under the several and collective guarantee to which we in\r\ncommon with Prussia and Austria were parties, and we should have seen at\r\nthe instance and by the action of two of these guaranteeing powers her\r\nneutrality violated, her independence strangled, her territory made use\r\nof as affording the easiest and the most convenient road to a war of\r\nunprovoked aggression against France. We, the British people, would at\r\nthis moment have been standing by with folded arms and with such\r\ncountenance as we could command while this small and unprotected State,\r\nin defense of her vital liberties, made a heroic stand against\r\noverweening and overwhelming force; we should have been admiring as\r\ndetached spectators the siege of Liége, the steady and manful resistance\r\nof a small army to the occupation of their capital, with its splendid\r\ntraditions and memories, the gradual forcing back of the patriotic\r\ndefenders of their native land to the ramparts of Antwerp, countless\r\noutrages inflicted by buccaneering levies exacted from the unoffending\r\ncivil population, and, finally, the greatest crime committed against\r\ncivilization and culture since the Thirty Years' War, the sack of\r\nLouvain, [cries of \"Shame!\"] with its buildings, its pictures, its\r\nunique library, its unrivaled associations--a shameless holocaust of\r\nirreparable treasures lit up by blind barbarian vengeance. [Prolonged\r\ncheers.] What account should we, the Government and the people of this\r\ncountry, have been able to render to the tribunal of our national\r\nconscience and sense of honor if, in defiance of our plighted and solemn\r\nobligations, we had endured, nay, if we had not done our best to\r\nprevent, yes, and to avenge, [renewed cheers,] these intolerable\r\noutrages? For my part I say that sooner than be a silent witness--which\r\nmeans in effect a willing accomplice--of this tragic triumph of force\r\nover law and of brutality over freedom, I would see this country of ours\r\nblotted out of the pages of history. [Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\nGermany's Aim--to Crush Freedom.\r\n\r\nThat is only a phase--a lurid and illuminating phase in the contest in\r\nwhich we have been called by the mandate of duty and of honor to bear\r\nour part. The cynical violation of the neutrality of Belgium was, after\r\nall, but a step--the first step--in a deliberate policy of which, if not\r\nthe immediate, the ultimate, and the not far distant aim, was to crush\r\nthe independence and autonomy of the free States of Europe. First\r\nBelgium, then Holland, then Switzerland, countries, like our own, imbued\r\nand sustained with the spirit of liberty, were one after another to be\r\nbent to the yoke, and these ambitions were fed and fostered by a body of\r\nnew doctrines and new philosophies preached by professors and learned\r\nmen. The free and full self-development which to these small States, to\r\nourselves, to our great and growing dominions over the seas, to our\r\nkinsmen across the Atlantic, is the well-spring and life-breath of\r\nnational existence--that free self-development is the one capital\r\noffense in the code of those who have made force their supreme divinity,\r\nand who upon its altars are prepared to sacrifice both the gathered\r\nfruits and the potential germs of the unfettered human spirit. [Cheers.]\r\nI use this language advisedly. This is not merely a material; it is also\r\na spiritual conflict. [Cheers.] Upon its issues everything that contains\r\npromise and hope, that leads to emancipation and a fuller liberty for\r\nthe millions who make up the mass of mankind will be found sooner or\r\nlater to depend.\r\n\r\nOur Efforts for Peace.\r\n\r\nLet me now just for a moment turn to the actual situation in Europe. How\r\ndo we stand? For the last ten years, by what I believe to be happy and\r\nwell-considered diplomatic arrangements, we have established friendly\r\nand increasingly intimate relations with the two powers, France and\r\nRussia, with whom, in days gone by, we have had in various parts of the\r\nworld occasions for constant friction, and now and again for possible\r\nconflict. Those new and better relations, based in the first instance\r\nupon business principles of give and take, matured into a settled temper\r\nof confidence and good-will. They were never in any sense or at any\r\ntime, as I have frequently said in this hall, directed against other\r\npowers. No man in the history of the world has ever labored more\r\nstrenuously or more successfully than my right honorable friend Sir\r\nEdward Grey [cheers] for that which is the supreme interest of the\r\nmodern world, a general and abiding peace. It is, I venture to think, a\r\nvery superficial criticism which suggests that under his guidance the\r\npolicy of this country has ignored, still less that it has counteracted\r\nand hampered, the concert of Europe. It is little more than a year ago\r\nthat under his Presidency, in the stress and strain of the Balkan\r\ncrisis, the Ambassadors of all the great powers met here day after day\r\ncurtailing the area of possible differences, reconciling warring\r\nambitions and aims, and preserving against almost incalculable odds the\r\ngeneral harmony. And it was in the same spirit and with the same\r\npurpose, when a few weeks ago Austria delivered her ultimatum to Servia,\r\nthat our Foreign Secretary put forward the proposal for a mediating\r\nconference between the four powers who were not directly\r\nconcerned--Germany, France, Italy, and ourselves. If that proposal had\r\nbeen accepted actual controversy would have been settled with honor to\r\neverybody, and the whole of this terrible welter would have been\r\navoided. [\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\n\r\nGermany's Responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnd with whom does the responsibility rest [cries of \"The Kaiser!\"] for\r\nthis refusal and for all the illimitable suffering which now confronts\r\nthe world? One power and one power only, and that power--Germany. [Loud\r\nhisses.] That is the fount and origin of this worldwide catastrophe. We\r\nare persevering to the end. No one who has not been confronted as we\r\nwere with the responsibility of determining the issues of peace and war\r\ncan realize the strength and energy and persistency with which we\r\nlabored for peace. We persevered by every expedient that diplomacy could\r\nsuggest, straining almost to the breaking point our most cherished\r\nfriendships and obligations, even to the last making effort upon effort,\r\nand hoping against hope. Then, and only then, when we were at last\r\ncompelled to realize that the choice lay between honor and dishonor,\r\nbetween treachery and good faith, when at last we reached the dividing\r\nline which makes or mars a nation worthy of the name, it was then, and\r\nthen only, that we declared for war. [Cheers.] Is there any one in this\r\nhall or in this United Kingdom or in the vast empire of which we here\r\nstand in the capital and centre who blames or repents our decision?\r\n[Cries of \"No!\"] For these reasons, as I believe, we must steel\r\nourselves to the task, and in the spirit which animated our forefathers\r\nin their struggle against the domination of Napoleon we must and we\r\nshall persevere to the end. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nMemorable and Glorious Example of Belgium.\r\n\r\nIt would be a criminal mistake to underestimate either the magnitude,\r\nthe fighting quality, or the staying power of the forces which are\r\narrayed against us. But it would be equally foolish and equally\r\nindefensible to belittle our own resources, whether for resistance or\r\nattack. [Cheers.] Belgium has shown us by a memorable and a glorious\r\nexample what can be done by a relatively small State when its citizens\r\nare animated and fired by the spirit of patriotism. In France and Russia\r\nwe have as allies two of the greatest powers of the world engaged with\r\nus in a common cause, who do not mean to separate themselves from us any\r\nmore than we mean to separate ourselves from them. [Cheers.] We have\r\nupon the seas the strongest and most magnificent fleet that has ever\r\nbeen seen. The expeditionary force which left our shores less than a\r\nmonth ago has never been surpassed, as its glorious achievements in the\r\nfield have already made clear, not only in material and equipment but in\r\nthe physical and the moral quality of its constituents. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nWork of the Navy.\r\n\r\nAs regards the navy, I am sure my right honorable friend (Mr. Winston\r\nChurchill) will tell you there is happily little more to be done. I do\r\nnot flatter it when I say that its superiority is equally marked in\r\nevery department and sphere of its activity. [Cheers.] We rely on it\r\nwith the most absolute confidence, not only to guard our shores against\r\nthe possibility of invasion, not only to seal up the gigantic\r\nbattleships of the enemy in the inglorious seclusion of his own ports\r\n[laughter] whence, from time to time, he furtively steals forth to sow\r\nthe seeds of murderous snares, which are more full of menace to neutral\r\nships than to the British fleet. Our navy does all this, and while it is\r\nthirsting, I do not doubt, for that trial of strength in a fair and open\r\nfight, which is so far prudently denied it, it does a great deal more.\r\nIt has hunted the German mercantile marine from the high seas. It has\r\nkept open our own sources of food supply and has largely curtailed\r\nthose of the enemy, and when the few German cruisers which still infest\r\nthe more distant ocean routes have been disposed of, as they will be\r\ndisposed of very soon, [cheers,] it will achieve for British and neutral\r\ncommerce passing backward and forward, from and to every part of our\r\nempire, a security as complete as it has ever enjoyed in the days of\r\nunbroken peace. Let us honor the memory of the gallant seamen who, in\r\nthe pursuit of one or another of these varied and responsible duties,\r\nhave already laid down their lives for their country.\r\n\r\nCall for United Effort.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the army there is call for a new, a continuous, a\r\ndetermined, and a united effort. For, as the war goes on, we shall have\r\nnot merely to replace the wastage caused by casualties, not merely to\r\nmaintain our military power at its original level, but we must, if we\r\nare to play a worthy part, enlarge its scale, increase its numbers, and\r\nmultiply many times its effectiveness as a fighting instrument.\r\n[Cheers.] The object of the appeal which I have made to you, my Lord\r\nMayor, and to the other chief Magistrates of our capital cities, is to\r\nimpress upon the people of the United Kingdom the imperious urgency of\r\nthis supreme duty. Our self-governing dominions throughout the empire,\r\nwithout any solicitation on our part, have demonstrated with a\r\nspontaneousness and a unanimity unparalleled in history their\r\ndetermination to affirm their brotherhood with us and to make our cause\r\ntheir own. [Cheers.] From Canada, from Australia, from New Zealand, from\r\nSouth Africa, and from Newfoundland the children of the empire assert,\r\nnot as an obligation, but as a privilege, their right and their\r\nwillingness to contribute money and material, and, what is better than\r\nall, the strength and sinews, the fortunes, and the lives of their best\r\nmanhood. [Cheers.] India, too, with no less alacrity, has claimed her\r\nshare in the common task. [Cheers.] Every class, and creed, British and\r\nnatives, Princes and people, Hindus and Mohammedans, vie with one\r\nanother in noble and emulous rivalry. Two divisions of our magnificent\r\nIndian Army are already on their way. [Cheers.] We welcome with\r\nappreciation and affection their proffered aid. In an empire which knows\r\nno distinction of race or cause we all alike as subjects of the\r\nKing-Emperor are joint and equal custodians of our common interests and\r\nfortunes. We are here to hail with profound and heartfelt gratitude\r\ntheir association, side by side and shoulder to shoulder, with our home\r\nand dominion troops, under the flag which is the symbol to all of a\r\nunity that a world in arms cannot dissever or dissolve. With these\r\ninspiring appeals and examples from our fellow-subjects all over the\r\nworld, what are we doing and what ought we to do here at home?\r\n\r\nOver a Quarter of a Million Men Enrolled.\r\n\r\nMobilization was ordered on the 4th of August; immediately afterward\r\nLord Kitchener issued his call for 100,000 recruits for the regular\r\narmy, which has been followed by a second call for another 100,000. The\r\nresponse up to today gives us between 250,000 and 300,000. [Cheers.] I\r\nam glad to say that London has done its share. The total number of\r\nLondoners accepted is not less than 42,000. [Cheers.] I need hardly say\r\nthat that appeal involves no disparagement or discouragement of the\r\nterritorial force. The number of units in that force who have\r\nvolunteered for foreign service is most satisfactory and grows every\r\nday. We look to them with confidence to increase their numbers, to\r\nperfect their organization and training, and to play efficiently the\r\npart which has always been assigned to them, both offensive and\r\ndefensive, in the military system of the empire. But to go back to the\r\nexpansion of the regular army. We want more men--men of the best\r\nfighting quality, and if for a moment the number who offer themselves\r\nand are accepted should prove to be in excess of those who can at once\r\nbe adequately trained and equipped, do not let them doubt that prompt\r\nprovision will be made for the incorporation of all willing and able\r\nmen in the fighting forces of the kingdom. We want, first of all, men,\r\nand we shall endeavor to secure them. Men desiring to serve together\r\nshall, wherever possible, be allotted to the same regiment or corps. The\r\nraising of battalions by counties or municipalities with this object\r\nwill be in every way encouraged. But we want not less urgently a larger\r\nsupply of ex-non-commissioned officers, and the pick of the men with\r\nwhom in past days they served, men, therefore, whom in most cases we\r\nshall be asking to give up regular employment and to return to the work\r\nof the State, which they alone are competent to do. The appeal we make\r\nis addressed quite as much to their employers as to the men themselves.\r\nThe men ought to be absolutely assured of reinstatement in their\r\nbusiness at the end of the war. [Cheers.] Finally, there are numbers of\r\ncommissioned officers now in retirement who are much experienced in the\r\nhandling of troops and have served their country in the past. Let them\r\ncome forward, too, and show their willingness, if need be, to train\r\nbodies of men for whom at the moment no cadre or unit can be found.\r\n\r\nAbundant Ground for Pride and Confidence.\r\n\r\nI have little more to say. Of the actual progress of the war I will not\r\nsay anything, except that in my judgment in whatever direction we look\r\nthere is abundant ground for pride and for confidence. [Cheers.] I say\r\nnothing more, because I think we should all bear in mind that we are at\r\npresent watching the fluctuations of fortune only in the early stages of\r\nwhat is going to be a protracted struggle. We must learn to take long\r\nviews, and to cultivate, above all, other faculties--those of patience,\r\nendurance, and steadfastness. Meanwhile, let us go, each of us, to his\r\nor her appropriate place in the great common task. Never had a people\r\nmore or richer sources of encouragement and inspiration. Let us realize,\r\nfirst of all, that we are fighting as a united empire, in a cause worthy\r\nof the highest traditions of our race. Let us keep in mind the patient\r\nand indomitable seamen, who never relax for a moment, night or day,\r\ntheir stern vigil of the lonely sea. Let us keep in mind our gallant\r\ntroops, who today, after a fortnight's continuous fighting under\r\nconditions which would try the metal of the best army that ever took the\r\nfield, maintain not only an undefeated but an unbroken front. [Cheers.]\r\nFinally, let us recall the memories of the great men and the great deeds\r\nof the past, commemorated, some of them, in the monuments which we see\r\naround us on these walls, not forgetting the dying message of the\r\nyounger Pitt, his last public utterance, made at the table of one of\r\nyour predecessors, my Lord Mayor, in this very hall: \"England has saved\r\nherself by her exertions, and will, as I trust, save Europe by her\r\nexample.\" The England of those days gave a noble answer to his appeal,\r\nand did not sheath the sword until, after nearly twenty years of\r\nfighting, the freedom of Europe was secured. Let us go and do likewise.\r\n[Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY SPEAKS.\r\n\r\nT. von Bethmann-Hollweg, German Imperial Chancellor, in Statement to\r\nRitzau's Danish Press Bureau, Sept. 13, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English Prime Minister, in his Guildhall speech, reserved to England\r\nthe role of protector of the smaller and weaker States, and spoke about\r\nthe neutrality of Holland, Belgium and Switzerland as being exposed to\r\ndanger from the side of Germany. It is true that we have broken\r\nBelgium's neutrality because bitter necessity compelled us to do so, but\r\nwe promised Belgium full indemnity and integrity if she would take\r\naccount of this state of necessity. If so, she would not have suffered\r\nany damage, as, for example, Luxemburg. If England, as protector of the\r\nweaker States, had wished to spare Belgium infinite suffering she should\r\nhave advised Belgium to accept our offer. England has not \"protected\"\r\nBelgium, so far as we know; I wonder, therefore, whether it can really\r\nbe said that England is such a disinterested protector.\r\n\r\nWe knew perfectly well that the French plan of campaign involved a march\r\nthrough Belgium to attack the unprotected Rhineland. Does any one\r\nbelieve England would have interfered to protect Belgian freedom against\r\nFrance?\r\n\r\nWe have firmly respected the neutrality of Holland and Switzerland; we\r\nhave also avoided the slightest violation of the frontier of the Dutch\r\nProvince of Limburg.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that Mr. Asquith only mentioned the neutrality of Belgium,\r\nHolland and Switzerland, but not that of the Scandinavian countries. He\r\nmight have mentioned Switzerland with reference to France, but Holland\r\nand Belgium are situated close to England on the opposite side of the\r\nChannel, and that is why England is so concerned for the neutrality of\r\nthese countries.\r\n\r\nWhy is Mr. Asquith silent about the Scandinavian countries? Perhaps\r\nbecause he knows that it does not enter our head to touch these\r\ncountries' neutrality; or would England possibly not consider Denmark's\r\nneutrality as a noli me tangere for an advance in the Baltic or for\r\nRussia's warlike operations.\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith wishes people to believe that England's fight against us is\r\na fight of freedom against might. The world is accustomed to this manner\r\nof expression. In the name of freedom, England, with might and with the\r\nmost recklessly egotistic policy, has founded her mighty colonial\r\nempire, in the name of freedom she has destroyed for a century the\r\nindependence of the Boer republics, in the name of freedom she now\r\ntreats Egypt as an English colony and thereby violates international\r\ntreaties and solemn promises, in the name of freedom one after another\r\nof the Malay States is losing its independence for England's benefit, in\r\nthe name of freedom she tries, by cutting German cables, to prevent the\r\ntruth being spread in the world.\r\n\r\nThe English Prime Minister is mistaken. When England joined with Russia\r\nand Japan against Germany she, with a blindness unique in the history of\r\nthe world, betrayed civilization and handed over to the German sword the\r\ncare of freedom for European peoples and States.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN REPLIES.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Grey, Answering Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, London,\r\nSept. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Does any one believe,\" asks the German Chancellor, \"that England would\r\nhave interfered to protect Belgian freedom against France?\" The answer\r\nis that she would unquestionably have done so. Sir Edward Grey, as\r\nrecorded in the \"White Paper,\" asked the French Government \"whether it\r\nwas prepared to engage to respect the neutrality of Belgium so long as\r\nno other power violates it.\" The French Government replied that they\r\nwere resolved to respect it. The assurance, it was added, had been given\r\nseveral times, and had formed the subject of conversation between\r\nPresident Poincaré and the King of the Belgians.\r\n\r\nThe German Chancellor entirely ignores the fact that England took the\r\nsame line about Belgian neutrality in 1870 that she has taken now. In\r\n1870 Prince Bismarck, when approached by England on the subject,\r\nadmitted and respected the treaty obligations in relation to Belgium.\r\nThe British Government stands in 1914 as it stood in 1870; it is Herr\r\nvon Bethmann-Hollweg who refused to meet us in 1914 as Prince Bismarck\r\nmet us in 1870.\r\n\r\nScandinavian Neutrality.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Chancellor finds it strange that Mr. Asquith, in his\r\nGuildhall speech, did not mention the neutrality of the Scandinavian\r\ncountries, and suggests that the reason for the omission was some\r\nsinister design on England's part. It is impossible for any public\r\nspeaker to cover the whole ground in each speech. The German\r\nChancellor's reference to Denmark and other Scandinavian countries can\r\nhardly be considered very tactful. With regard to Denmark, the Danes are\r\nnot likely to have forgotten the parts played by Prussia and England\r\nrespectively in 1863-4, when the Kingdom of Denmark was dismembered.\r\nAnd the integrity of Norway and Sweden was guaranteed by England and\r\nFrance in the Treaty of Stockholm in 1855.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Chancellor refers to the dealings of Great Britain with the\r\nBoer republics, and suggests that she has been false therein to the\r\ncause of freedom. Without going into controversies now happily past, we\r\nmay recall what Gen. Botha said in the South African Parliament a few\r\ndays ago when expressing his conviction of the righteousness of\r\nBritain's cause and explaining the firm resolve of the South African\r\nUnion to aid her in every possible way. \"Great Britain had given them a\r\nConstitution under which they could create a great nationality, and had\r\never since regarded them as a free people and as a sister State.\r\nAlthough there might be many who in the past had been hostile toward the\r\nBritish flag, he could vouch for it that they would ten times rather be\r\nunder the British than under the German flag.\"\r\n\r\nLoyalty of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe German Chancellor is equally unfortunate in his references to the\r\n\"Colonial Empire.\" So far from British policy having been \"recklessly\r\negotistic,\" it has resulted in a great rally of affection and common\r\ninterest by all the British dominions and dependencies, among which\r\nthere is not one which is not aiding Britain by soldiers or other\r\ncontributions or both in this war.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the matter of treaty obligations generally, the German\r\nChancellor excuses the breach of Belgian neutrality by military\r\nnecessity--at the same time making a virtue of having respected the\r\nneutrality of Holland and Switzerland, and saying that it does not enter\r\nhis head to touch the neutrality of the Scandinavian countries. A virtue\r\nwhich admittedly is only practiced in the absence of temptation from\r\nself-interest and military advantage does not seem greatly worth\r\nvaunting. To the Chancellor's concluding statement that \"to the German\r\nsword\" is intrusted \"the care of freedom for European peoples and\r\nStates,\" the treatment of Belgium is a sufficient answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ASQUITH AT EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\nSpeech in Usher Hall, Sept. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortnight ago today, in the Guildhall of the City of London, I\r\nendeavored to present to the nation and to the world the reasons which\r\nhave compelled us, the people of all others which have the greatest\r\ninterest in the maintenance of peace, to engage in the hazards and\r\nhorrors of war. I do not wish to repeat tonight in any detail what I\r\nthen said.\r\n\r\nThe war has arisen immediately and ostensibly, as every one knows, out\r\nof a dispute between Austria and Servia, in which we in this country had\r\nno direct concern. The diplomatic history of those critical weeks--the\r\nlast fortnight in July and the first few days of August--is now\r\naccessible to all the world. It has been supplemented during the last\r\nfew days by the admirable and exhaustive dispatch of our late Ambassador\r\nat Vienna, Sir Maurice de Bunsen, a dispatch which I trust everybody\r\nwill read, and no one who reads it can doubt that, largely through the\r\nefforts of my right honorable friend and colleague Sir Edward Grey [loud\r\ncheers] the conditions of a peaceful settlement of the actual\r\ncontroversy were already within sight when, on July 31, Germany [hisses]\r\nby her own deliberate act made war a certainty.\r\n\r\nThe facts are incontrovertible. They are not sought to be controverted,\r\nexcept, indeed, by the invention and circulation of such wanton\r\nfalsehoods as that France was contemplating, and even commencing, the\r\nviolation of Belgian territory as a first step on her road to Germany.\r\nThe result is that we are at war, and, as I have already shown\r\nelsewhere, and as I repeat here tonight, we are at war for three\r\nreasons--in the first place, to vindicate the sanctity of treaty\r\nobligations [\"Hear, hear!\"] and of what is properly called the public\r\nlaw of Europe, [\"Hear, hear!\";] in the second place, to assert and to\r\nenforce the independence of free States, relatively small and weak,\r\nagainst the encroachments and the violence of the strong, [cheers,] and,\r\nin the third place, to withstand, as we believe in the best interests\r\nnot only of our own empire but of civilization at large, the arrogant\r\nclaim of a single power to dominate the development of the destinies of\r\nEurope. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nMeeting a Challenge.\r\n\r\nSince I last spoke some faint attempts have been made in Germany to\r\ndispute the accuracy and the sincerity of this statement of our attitude\r\nand aim. It has been suggested, for instance, that our professed zeal\r\nfor treaty rights and for the interests of small States is a newborn and\r\nsimulated passion. What, we are asked, has Great Britain cared in the\r\npast for treaties or for the smaller nationalities except when she had\r\nsome ulterior and selfish purpose of her own to serve? I am quite ready\r\nto meet that challenge, and to meet it in the only way in which it could\r\nbe met, by reference to history. And out of many illustrations which I\r\nmight take I will content myself here tonight with two, widely removed\r\nin point of time, but both, as it happens, very apposite to the present\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nI will go back first to the war carried on first against the\r\nrevolutionary Government of France and then against Napoleon, which\r\nbroke out in 1793, and which lasted for more than twenty years. We had\r\nthen at the head of the Government in this country one of the most\r\npeace-loving Ministers who have ever presided over our fortunes--Mr.\r\nPitt. For three years, from 1789 to 1792, he resolutely refused to\r\ninterfere in any way with the revolutionary proceedings in France or in\r\nthe wars that sprang out of them, and as lately, I think, as February in\r\n1792, in a memorable speech in the House of Commons, which shows among\r\nother things the shortness of human foresight, he declared that there\r\nnever was a time when we in this country could more reasonably expect\r\nfifteen years of peace.\r\n\r\nAnd what was it, gentlemen, that, within a few months of that\r\ndeclaration, led this pacific Minister to war? It was the invasion of\r\nthe treaty rights guaranteed by ourselves of a small European State, the\r\nthen States General of Holland. [Cheers.] For nearly 200 years the great\r\npowers of Europe had guaranteed to Holland the exclusive navigation of\r\nthe River Scheldt. The French revolutionary Government invaded what is\r\nnow Belgium, and as a first act of hostility to Holland declared the\r\nnavigation of the Scheldt to be open. Our interest in that matter then,\r\nas now, was relatively small and insignificant, but what was Mr. Pitt's\r\nreply?\r\n\r\nDefense of Small States.\r\n\r\nI quote you the exact words he used in the House of Commons, they are so\r\napplicable to the circumstances of the present moment. This is in 1793:\r\n\r\n     England will never consent that another country should arrogate the\r\n     power of annulling, at her pleasure, the political system of\r\n     Europe, established by solemn treaties and guaranteed by the\r\n     consent of the powers. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nHe went on to say:\r\n\r\n     This House [the House of Commons] means substantial good faith to\r\n     its engagements. If it retains a just sense of the solemn faith of\r\n     treaties, it must show a determination to support them.\r\n\r\nAnd it was in consequence of that stubborn and unyielding determination\r\nto maintain treaties to defend small States, to resist the aggressive\r\ndomination of a single power, that we were involved in a war which we\r\nhad done everything to avoid, and which was carried on upon a scale,\r\nboth as to area and as to duration, up to then unexampled in the history\r\nof mankind. That is one precedent. Let me give you one more.\r\n\r\nI come down to 1870, when this very treaty to which we are parties, no\r\nless than Germany, and which guarantees the integrity and independence\r\nof Belgium, was threatened. Mr. Gladstone was then Prime Minister of\r\nthis country, [cheers,] and he was, if possible, a stronger and more\r\nardent advocate of peace even than Mr. Pitt himself. [\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's Dictum.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, pacific as he was, felt so strongly the sanctity of our\r\nobligations that--though here again we had no direct interest of any\r\nkind at stake--he made agreements with France and Prussia to co-operate\r\nwith either of the belligerents if the other violated Belgian territory,\r\nand I should like to read a passage from a speech ten years later,\r\ndelivered in 1880, by Mr. Gladstone himself in this city, in which he\r\nreviewed that transaction and explained his reasons for it. He said: \"If\r\nwe had gone to war\"--which he was prepared to do--\"we should have gone\r\nto war for freedom; we should have gone to war for public right; we\r\nshould have gone to war to save human happiness from being invaded by\r\ntyrannous and lawless power.\" That is what I call a good cause, though I\r\ndetest war, and there are no epithets too strong if you will supply me\r\nwith them that I will not endeavor to heap upon its head.\r\n\r\nSo much for our own action in the past in regard to treaties and small\r\nStates. But faint as is this denial of this part of our case, it becomes\r\nfainter still, it dissolves into the thinnest of thin air, when it has\r\nto deal with our contention that we and our allies are withstanding a\r\npower whose aim is nothing less than the domination of Europe. [\"Hear,\r\nhear!\"]\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, the avowed belief of the leaders of German thought--I\r\nwill not say of the German people--of those who for many years past have\r\ncontrolled German policy, that such a domination, carrying with it the\r\nsupremacy of what they call German culture [laughter] and the German\r\nspirit is the best thing that could happen to the world.\r\n\r\nGerman \"Culture.\"\r\n\r\nLet me then ask for a moment what is this German culture, what is this\r\nGerman spirit of which the Emperor's armies are at present the\r\nmissionaries in Belgium and in France? [Laughter.] Mankind owes much to\r\nGermany, a very great debt for the contributions she has made to\r\nphilosophy, to science and to the arts; but that which is specifically\r\nGerman in the movement of the world in the last thirty years has been,\r\non the intellectual side, the development of the doctrine of the supreme\r\nand ultimate prerogative in human affairs of material forces, and, on\r\nthe practical side, taking of the foremost place in the fabrication and\r\nthe multiplication of the machinery of destruction.\r\n\r\nTo the men who have adopted this gospel, who believe that power is the\r\nbe all and end all of the State, naturally a treaty is nothing more than\r\na piece of parchment, and all the Old World talk about the rights of the\r\nweak and the obligations of the strong is only so much threadbare and\r\nnauseating cant, for one very remarkable feature of this new school of\r\ndoctrine is, whatever be its intellectual or its ethical merits, that it\r\nhas turned out as an actual code for life to be a very purblind\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nThe German culture, the German spirit, did not save the Emperor and his\r\npeople from delusions and miscalculations as dangerous as they were\r\nabsurd in regard to the British Empire.\r\n\r\nA Fantastic Dream.\r\n\r\nWe were believed by these cultivated observers [laughter] to be the\r\ndecadent descendants of a people who, by a combination of luck and of\r\nfraud, [laughter,] had managed to obtain dominion over a vast quantity\r\nof the surface and the populations of the globe.\r\n\r\nThis fortuitous aggregation [laughter and cheers] which goes by the name\r\nof the British Empire was supposed to be so insecurely founded, and so\r\nloosely knit together, that at the first touch of serious menace from\r\nwithout it would fall to pieces and tumble to the ground. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nOur great dominions were getting heartily tired of the imperial\r\nconnection. India, [loud cheers,] it was notorious to every German\r\ntraveler, [laughter,] was on the verge of open revolt, and here at home\r\nwe, the people of this United Kingdom, were riven by dissension so deep\r\nand so fierce that our energies, whether for resistance or for attack,\r\nwould be completely paralyzed.\r\n\r\nWhat a fantastic dream, [\"Hear, hear!\"] and what a rude awakening!\r\n[Laughter and cheers.] And in this vast and grotesque and yet tragic\r\nmiscalculation is to be found one of the roots, perhaps the main root,\r\nof the present war.\r\n\r\nBut let us go one step more. It has been said, \"By their fruits ye shall\r\nknow them,\" and history will record that when the die was cast and the\r\nstruggle began, it was the disciples of that same creed who revived\r\nmethods of warfare which have for centuries past been condemned by the\r\ncommon sense as well as by the humanity of the great mass of the\r\ncivilized world. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nBranded on the Brow.\r\n\r\nLouvain, Malines, Termonde--these are names which will henceforward be\r\nbranded on the brow of German culture. The ruthless sacking of the\r\nancient and famous towns of Belgium is fitly supplemented by the story\r\nthat reaches us only today from our own headquarters in France of the\r\nproclamation issued less than a week ago by the German authorities, who\r\nwere for a moment, and happily for little more than a moment, in\r\noccupation of the venerable city of Rheims.\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith then read the concluding paragraph of the proclamation which\r\nappeared in these columns yesterday.\r\n\r\nDo not let it be forgotten that it is from a power whose intellectual\r\nleaders are imbued with the idea that I have described, and whose\r\nGenerals in the field sanction and even direct those practices--it is\r\nfrom that power the claim proceeds to impose its culture, its spirit,\r\nwhich means its domination, upon the rest of Europe. That is a claim, I\r\nsay to you, to all my fellow-countrymen, to every citizen and subject of\r\nthe British Empire whose ears and eyes my words can reach--that is a\r\nclaim that everything that is great in our past and everything that\r\npromises hope or progress in our future summons us to resist to the end.\r\n[Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe task--do not let us deceive ourselves--will not be a light one. Its\r\nfull accomplishment--and nothing short of full accomplishment\r\n[cheers]--is worthy of our traditions or will satisfy our resolve--will\r\ncertainly take months. It may even take years.\r\n\r\nI have come here tonight not to ask you to count the cost, for no price\r\ncan be too high to pay when honor and freedom are at stake, but to put\r\nbefore you, as I have tried to do, the magnitude of the issue and the\r\nsupreme necessity that lies upon us as a nation, nay as a brotherhood\r\nand family of nations, to rise to its height and acquit ourselves of our\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nOur Favorable Position.\r\n\r\nThe war has now lasted more than six weeks. Our supremacy at sea [great\r\ncheers] has not been seriously questioned. [Laughter.] Full supplies of\r\nfood and of raw materials are making their way to our shores from every\r\nquarter of the globe. [Cheers.] Our industries, with one or two\r\nexceptions, maintain their activities.\r\n\r\nUnemployment is so far not seriously in excess of the average. The\r\nmonetary situation has improved, and every effort that the zeal and the\r\nskill of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [cheers,] with the\r\nco-operation and expert advice of the bankers and business men of the\r\ncountry, can devise--every effort is being made to achieve what is most\r\nessential, the complete re-establishment of the foreign exchanges.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the merchant shipping of the enemy has been hunted from the\r\nseas [cheers] and our seaman are still patiently, or impatiently,\r\n[laughter,] waiting for a chance to try conclusions with the opposing\r\nfleet. Great and incalculable is the debt which we have owed during\r\nthese weeks, and which in increasing measure we shall continue to owe,\r\nto our navy. [Cheers.] The navy needs no help, and as the months roll\r\non--thanks to a far-sighted policy in the past--its proportionate\r\nstrength will grow. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nArmy's Glorious Record.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to our army [cheers] we can say with equal justice and pride\r\nthat during these weeks it has rivaled the most glorious records of its\r\npast. [Cheers.] Sir John French [cheers] and his gallant officers and\r\nmen live in our hearts, as they will live in the memories of those who\r\ncome afterward. [Cheers,]\r\n\r\nBut splendid achievements such as these--equally splendid in retirement\r\nand in advance [\"Hear, hear!\"]--cannot be won without a heavy\r\nexpenditure of life and limb, of equipment and supplies. Even now, at\r\nthis very early stage, I suppose there is hardly a person here who is\r\nnot suffering from anxiety and suspense. Some of us are plunged in\r\nsorrow for the loss of those we love; cut off, some of them, in the\r\nspringtime of their young lives. We will not mourn for them overmuch.\r\nOne crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name.\r\n[Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThese gaps have to be filled. The wastage of modern war is relentless\r\nand almost inconceivable. We have--I mean his Majesty's Government\r\nhave--since the war began dispatched to the front already considerably\r\nover 200,000 men [cheers] and the amplest provision has been made for\r\nkeeping them supplied with all that was necessary in food, in stores,\r\nand in equipment. They will very soon be reinforced by regular troops\r\nfrom India, from Egypt, and the Mediterranean, and in due time by the\r\ncontingents which our dominions are furnishing with such magnificent\r\npatriotism and liberality. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nEager Territorials.\r\n\r\nWe have with us here our own gallant territorials, becoming every day a\r\nfitter and a finer force, eager and anxious to respond to any call\r\neither at home or abroad that may be made upon them. [Cheers.] But that\r\nis not enough. We must do still more. Already, in little more than a\r\nmonth, we have 500,000 recruits for the four new armies which, as Lord\r\nKitchener told the country yesterday, he means to have ready to bring\r\ninto the field. In a single day we have had as many men enlist as we\r\nhave been accustomed to enlist in the course of a whole year. It is not,\r\nI think, surprising that the machinery has been overstrained, and there\r\nhave been many cases of temporary inconvenience and hardship and\r\ndiscomfort. With time and patience and good organization these things\r\nwill be set right, and the new scale of allowances which was announced\r\nin Parliament yesterday [cheers] will do much to mitigate the lot of\r\nwives and children and dependents who are left behind. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nWe want more men, and, perhaps most of all, the help for training them.\r\nEvery one in the whole of this kingdom who has in days gone by, as\r\nofficer or as non-commissioned officer, served his country never had a\r\ngreater or more fruitful opportunity for service than is presented to\r\nhim today. [Cheers.] We appeal to the manhood of the three kingdoms. To\r\nsuch an appeal I know well, coming from your senior representative in\r\nthe House of Commons, that Scotland will not turn a deaf ear. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nScotland is doing well, and, indeed, more than well, and no part of\r\nScotland I believe, in proportion, better than Edinburgh. I cannot say\r\nwith what pleasure I heard the figures given out by the Lord Provost and\r\nthose which have been supplied to me by the gallant gentleman who has\r\nthe Scottish command [cheers,] which show, indeed, as we expected, that\r\nScotland is more than holding her own. In that connection let me repeat\r\nwhat I said two weeks ago in London. We think it of the highest\r\nimportance that so far as possible, and subject to the accidents of war,\r\npeople belonging to the same place, breathing the same atmosphere,\r\nhaving the same associations, should be kept together.\r\n\r\nOur recruits come to us spontaneously, under no kind of compulsion,\r\n[cheers,] of their own free will to meet a national and an imperial\r\nneed. We present to them no material inducement in the shape either of\r\nbounty or bribe, and they have to face the prospect of a spell of hard\r\ntraining from which most of the comforts and all the luxuries that any\r\nof them have been accustomed to are rigorously banished. But then, when\r\nthey are fully equipped for their patriotic task, they will have the\r\nopportunity of striking a blow, it may be even of laying down their\r\nlives, not to serve the cause of ambition or aggression, but to maintain\r\nthe honor and the good faith of our country, to shield the independence\r\nof free States, to protect against brute force the principles of\r\ncivilization and the liberties of Europe. [Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ASQUITH AT DUBLIN.\r\n\r\nSpeech in the Round Room of the Mansion House, Sept. 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lord Mayor: Some weeks ago I took it upon myself to suggest to the\r\nfour principal Magistrates of the United Kingdom that they should afford\r\nme an opportunity of making a personal appeal to their citizens at a\r\ngreat moment in our national history. I have already delivered my\r\nmessage in London and in Edinburgh. To the first of those great\r\ncommunities I was able to speak as an Englishman by birth and as a\r\nLondoner by early association and long residence. To the second, the\r\ncapital of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland, I had special credentials as\r\nhaving been for the best part of thirty years one of their\r\nrepresentatives in the House of Commons, [\"Hear, hear!\"] and now,\r\nindeed, by one of the melancholy privileges of time the senior among the\r\nScottish members. [Laughter.] But, my Lord Mayor, tonight when I come to\r\nDublin I can put forward neither the one claim nor the other. [A\r\nVoice--Home Rule.] I base my title, such as it is, to your hospitality\r\nand your hearing upon such service as during the whole of my political\r\nlife I have tried with a whole heart and to the best of my faculties and\r\nopportunities to render to Ireland. [Cheers.] I come here, not as a\r\npartisan, not even as a politician, but I come here as for the time\r\nbeing the head of the King's Government, [cheers,] to summon Ireland, a\r\nloyal and patriotic Ireland, to take her place in the defense of our\r\ncommon cause. [Cheers.] My Lord Mayor, it is no part of my mission\r\ntonight, it is indeed at this time of day wholly unnecessary, to\r\njustify, still less to excuse, the part which the Government of the\r\nUnited Kingdom has taken in this supreme crisis in our national\r\naffairs. There have been wars in the past in regard to which there has\r\nbeen among us diversity of opinion, uneasiness as to the wisdom of our\r\ndiplomacy, anxiety as to the expediency of our policy, doubts as to the\r\nessential righteousness of our cause.\r\n\r\nUnity of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThat, my Lord Mayor, as you said, is not the case today. [Cheers.] Even\r\nin the memorable struggle which we waged a hundred years ago against the\r\ndomination of Napoleon there was always a minority, respectable not\r\nmerely in number, but in the sincerity and in the eminence of its\r\nadherents, which broke the front of our national unity. Again I say that\r\nis not the case today. We feel as a nation--or rather I ought to say,\r\nspeaking here and looking round upon our vast empire in every quarter of\r\nthe globe--as a family of nations, [prolonged cheers,] without\r\ndistinction of creed or party, of race or climate, class or section,\r\nthat we are united in defending principles and in maintaining interests\r\nwhich are vital, not only to the British Empire, but to all that is\r\nworth having in our common civilization, [cheers,] and all that is worth\r\nhoping for in the future progress of mankind. [Loud cheers.] What better\r\nor higher cause, my Lord Mayor, whether we succeed or fail? [Cries of\r\n\"No failure.\"] We are going not to fail, but to succeed. [Enthusiastic\r\ncheers.] What higher cause than to arouse and enlist the best qualities\r\nof a free people, than to be engaged at one and the same time in the\r\nvindication of international good faith, in the protection of the weak\r\nagainst the violence of the strong, [cheers,] and in the assertion of\r\nthe best ideals of all the free communities in all the ages of time and\r\nin every part of the world against the encroachments of those who\r\nbelieve and who preach and who practice the religion of force? It is\r\nnot--I am sure you will agree with me--it is not necessary to\r\ndemonstrate once more that of this war Germany is the real and the\r\nresponsible author. [Cheers.] The proofs are patent, manifold and\r\noverwhelming. [Cheers.] Indeed, on the part of Germany herself we get\r\nupon this point, if denial at all, a denial only of the faintest and the\r\nmost formal kind. For a generation past she has been preparing the\r\nground, equipping herself, both by land and sea, fortifying herself with\r\nalliances, and, what is perhaps even more important, teaching her youth\r\nto seek and to pursue as the first and the most important of all human\r\nthings the supremacy of the German power and the German spirit, and all\r\nthat time biding her opportunity. Gentlemen, many of the great wars of\r\nhistory have been almost accidentally brought about by the blindness of\r\nblundering statesmen, or by some wave of popular passion. That is not so\r\ntoday. [\"Hear, hear!\"] There was nothing in a quarrel such as this\r\nbetween Austria and Servia that could not have been and that would not\r\nhave been settled by pacific means. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nGermany's Profound Mistakes.\r\n\r\nBut in the judgment of those who guide and control German policy the\r\nhour had come to strike the blow that had been long and deliberately\r\nprepared. In their hands lay the choice between peace and war, and their\r\nelection was for war. In so deciding, as everybody now knows, Germany\r\nmade two profound miscalculations. [Cheers.] Both of them natural enough\r\nin a man who had come to believe that in international matters\r\neverything can be explained and measured in terms of material force.\r\nWhat, gentlemen, were those mistakes? The first was that Belgium,\r\n[cheers,] a small and prosperous country entirely disinterested in\r\nEuropean quarrels, guaranteed by the joint and several compacts of the\r\ngreat powers, that Belgium would not resent, and certainly would not\r\nresist, the use of her territory as a highroad for an invading German\r\nforce into France. How could they imagine that this little country,\r\nrather than allow her neutrality to be violated and her independence\r\ninsulted and menaced, was prepared that her fields should be drenched\r\nwith the blood of her soldiers, her towns and villages devastated by\r\nmarauders, her splendid heritage of monuments and of treasures, built up\r\nfor her by the piety, art, and learning of the past, ruthlessly laid in\r\nruins? The passionate attachment of a numerically small population to\r\nthe bit of territory, which looks so little upon the map, the pride and\r\nthe unconquerable devotion of a free people to their own free State,\r\nthese were things which apparently had never been dreamed of in the\r\nphilosophy of Potsdam. [Laughter and \"Hear, hear!\"] Rarely in history\r\nhas there been a greater material disparity between the invaders and the\r\ninvaded, but the moral disparity was at least equally great. [Cheers.]\r\nFor, gentlemen, the indomitable resistance of the Belgians did more than\r\nchange the whole face of the campaign. [Cheers.] It proved to the world\r\nthat ideas which cannot be weighed or measured by any material calculus\r\ncan still inspire and dominate mankind. [Cheers.] And that is the reason\r\nwhy the whole sympathy of the civilized world at this moment is going\r\nout to these small States--Belgium, Servia, and Montenegro--that have\r\nplayed so worthy a part in this historic struggle. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe Moral Bond of Civilization.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lord Mayor, Germany was guilty of another and a still more\r\ncapital blunder in relation to ourselves. [\"Hear, hear!\"] I am not\r\nreferring for the moment to the grotesque understanding upon which I\r\ndwelt a week ago at Edinburgh, their carefully fostered belief that we\r\nhere were so rent with civil distraction, [laughter,] so paralyzed by\r\nluke-warmness or disaffection in our dominions and dependencies, that if\r\nit came to fighting we might be brushed aside as an impotent and even a\r\nnegligible factor. [Cheers and cries of \"Never!\"] The German\r\nmisconception went even deeper than that. They asked themselves what\r\ninterest, direct or material, had the United Kingdom in this conflict?\r\nCould any nation, least of all the cold, calculating, phlegmatic,\r\negotistic British nation, [laughter,] embark upon a costly and bloody\r\ncontest from which it had nothing in the hope of profit to expect?\r\n[\"Hear, hear!\"] They forgot--they forgot that we, like the Belgians, had\r\nsomething at stake which cannot be translated into what one of our\r\npoets has called \"The law of nicely calculated less or more.\" What was\r\nit we had at stake? First and foremost, the fulfillment to the small and\r\nrelatively weak country of our plighted word [cheers] and behind and\r\nbeyond that the maintenance of the whole system of international\r\ngood-will which is the moral bond of the civilized world. [Cheers.] Here\r\nagain they were wrong in thinking that the reign of ideas, Old World\r\nideas like those of duty and good faith, had been superseded by the\r\nascendency of force. My Lord Mayor, war is at all times a hideous thing;\r\nat the best an evil to be chosen in preference to worse evils, and at\r\nthe worst little better than the letting loose of hell upon earth. The\r\nprophet of old spoke of the \"confused noise of battle and the garments\r\nrolled in blood,\" but in these modern days, with the gigantic scale of\r\nthe opposing armies and the scientific developments of the instruments\r\nof destruction, war has become an infinitely more devastating thing than\r\nit ever was before. The hope that the general recognition of a humaner\r\ncode would soften or abate some of its worst brutalities has been rudely\r\ndispelled by the events of the last few weeks. [\"Shame!\"]\r\n\r\nShameful and Cynical Desecration.\r\n\r\nThe German invasion of Belgium and France contributes, indeed, some of\r\nthe blackest pages to its sombre annals. Rarely has a non-combatant\r\npopulation suffered more severely, and rarely, if ever, have the\r\nmonuments of piety and of learning and those sentiments of religion and\r\nnational association, of which they are the permanent embodiment, even\r\nin the worst times of the most ruthless warriors, been so shamefully and\r\ncynically desecrated; and behind the actual theatre of conflict with its\r\nsmoke and its carnage there are the sufferings of those who are left\r\nbehind, the waste of wealth, the economic dislocation, the heritage, the\r\nlong heritage of enmities and misunderstanding which war brings in its\r\ntrain. Why do I dwell upon these things? It is to say this, that great\r\nindeed is the responsibility of those who allow their country--as we\r\nhave done--to be drawn into such a welter; but there is one thing much\r\nworse than to take such a responsibility, and that is, upon a fitting\r\noccasion, to shirk it. [Cheers.] Our record in the matter is clear. We\r\nstrove up to the last moment for peace [cheers] and only when we were\r\nsatisfied that the price of peace was the betrayal of other countries\r\nand the dishonor and degradation of our own we took up the sword.\r\n[Prolonged cheers.] I should like, if I might for a moment, beyond this\r\ninquiry into causes and motives, to ask your attention and that of my\r\nfellow-countrymen to the end which in this war we ought to keep in view.\r\nForty-four years ago, at the time of the war of 1870, Mr. Gladstone used\r\nthese words. He said: \"The greatest triumph of our time will be the\r\nenthronement of the idea of public right as the governing idea of\r\nEuropean politics.\" Nearly fifty years have passed. Little progress, it\r\nseems, has yet been made toward that good and beneficent change, but it\r\nseems to me to be now at this moment as good a definition as we can have\r\nof our European policy. The idea of public right; what does it mean when\r\ntranslated into concrete terms? It means, first and foremost, the\r\nclearing of the ground by the definite repudiation of militarism as the\r\ngoverning factor in the relation of States, and of the future molding of\r\nthe European world. It means, next, that room must be found and kept for\r\nthe independent existence and the free development of the smaller\r\nnationalities, [cheers,] each with a corporate consciousness of its own.\r\n\r\nThe Recognition of Nationality.\r\n\r\nBelgium, Holland, and Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries,\r\nGreece, and the Balkan States, they must be recognized as having exactly\r\nas good a title as their more powerful neighbors--more powerful in\r\nstrength and in wealth--exactly as good a title to a place in the sun.\r\n[Prolonged cheers and some laughter.] And it means, finally, or it ought\r\nto mean, perhaps by a slow and gradual process, the substitution for\r\nforce, for the clash of competing ambition, for grouping and alliances\r\nand a precarious equipoise, the substitution for all these things of a\r\nreal European partnership, based on the recognition of equal right and\r\nestablished and enforced by a common will. [Cheers.] A year ago that\r\nwould have sounded like a Utopian idea. It is probably one that may not\r\nor will not be realized either today or tomorrow. If and when this war\r\nis decided in favor of the Allies, it will at once come within the\r\nrange, and, before long, within the grasp of European statesmanship.\r\n[Cheers.] I go back for a moment, if I am not keeping you too long, [\"Go\r\non,\"] to the peculiar aspects of the actual case upon which I have\r\ndwelt, because it seems to me that they ought to make a special appeal\r\nto the people of Ireland. Ireland is a loyal country, [cheers,] and she\r\nwould, I know, respond with alacrity to any summons which called upon\r\nher to take her share in the assertion and the defense of our common\r\ninterests. But, gentlemen, the issues raised by this war are of such a\r\nkind that, unless I mistake her people and misrepresent her history,\r\nthey touch a vibrating chord both in her imagination and in her\r\nconscience. How can you Irishmen be deaf to the cry of the smaller\r\nnationalities to help them in their struggle for freedom [cheers]\r\nwhether, as in the case of Belgium, in maintaining what she has won, or\r\nas in the case of Poland or the Balkan States in regaining what they\r\nhave lost or in acquiring and putting upon a stable foundation what has\r\nnever been fully theirs?\r\n\r\nThe Appeal to Ireland.\r\n\r\nHow again can you Irishmen--if I understand you--sit by in cool\r\ndetachment and with folded arms while we, in company of our gallant\r\nallies of France and Russia, are opposing a worldwide resistance to\r\npretensions which threaten to paralyze and sterilize all progress and\r\nthe best destinies of mankind? [Cheers.] During the last few weeks Sir\r\nJohn French and his heroic forces have worthily sustained our cause. The\r\ncasualties have been heavy. Ireland has had her share, although they\r\nhave been increased during the last week from the ranks of our gallant\r\nnavy by one of the hazards of warfare at sea. But of those who have\r\nfallen in both services we may ask how could men die better? [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe Indian Contingent.\r\n\r\nThey have left behind them an example and an appeal. From all quarters\r\nof the empire its best manhood is flowing in. The first Indian\r\ncontingent is, I believe, landing today at Marseilles, [loud cheers,]\r\nand in all parts of our great dominions the convoys are already\r\nmustering. Over half a million recruits have joined the colors here at\r\nhome, [cheers,] and I come to ask you in Ireland, though you don't need\r\nmy asking, to take your part. [Cheers and shouts of \"We must.\"] There\r\nwas a time when, through the operations of laws which every one now\r\nacknowledges to have been both unjust and impolitic, [\"Hear, hear!\"] the\r\nmartial spirit of and the capacity for which Irishmen have always been\r\nconspicuous, found its chief outlet in the alien armies of the\r\nContinent. I have seen it computed--I do not know whether with precise\r\naccuracy--but I have seen it computed upon good authority that in the\r\nfirst fifty years of the eighteenth century, when the penal laws were\r\nhere in full swing, nearly half a million Irishmen enlisted under the\r\nbanners of the empire of France and Spain, and we at home in the United\r\nKingdom suffered a double loss; for, gentlemen, not only were we drained\r\nyear by year of some of our best fighting material, [\"Hear, hear!\"] but\r\nover and over again we found ourselves engaged in battle array suffering\r\nand inflicting deadly loss upon those who might have been, and under\r\nhappier conditions would have been, fellow-soldiers of our own.\r\n[Cheers.] The British Empire has always been proud, and with reason, of\r\nthose Irish regiments [cheers] and their Irish leaders, [more cheers,]\r\nand was never prouder of them that it is today. [Great cheering.] We ask\r\nyou here in Ireland to give us more, [cheers, and a Voice, \"You'll get\r\nthem,\"] to give them without stinting. We ask Ireland to give of her\r\nsons, the most in number, the best in quality that a proud and loyal\r\ndaughter of the empire ought to devote to the common cause. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe Volunteers of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe conditions seem to me to be exceptionally favorable for the purpose.\r\nWe have of late been witnessing here in Ireland a spontaneous enrollment\r\nand organization in all parts of the country of bodies of volunteers. I\r\nsay nothing--for I wish tonight to avoid trespassing upon even a square\r\ninch of controversial ground--I say nothing of the causes or motives\r\nwhich brought them originally into existence, [laughter,] and have\r\nfostered their growth and strength. I will only say--and this is my\r\nnearest approach to politics tonight--that there are two things which to\r\nmy mind have become unthinkable. The first is that one section of\r\nIrishmen are going to fight. [Loud cheers.] The second is that Great\r\nBritain is going to fight either. [Renewed cheers.] Speaking here in\r\nDublin, I may perhaps address myself for a moment particularly to the\r\nNational Volunteers, and I am going to ask them all over Ireland--not\r\nonly them, but I make the appeal to them particularly--to contribute\r\nwith promptitude and enthusiasm a large and worthy contingent of\r\nrecruits to the second new army of half a million, which is growing up\r\nas it were out of the ground. [Cheers.] I should like to see, and we all\r\nwant to see, an Irish brigade, [cheers,] or, better still, an Irish army\r\ncorps. [Loud cheers.] Do not let them be afraid that by joining the\r\ncolors they will lose their identity and become absorbed in some\r\ninvertebrate mass, or, what is perhaps equally repugnant, be\r\nartificially redistributed in units which have no national cohesion or\r\ncharacter. We wish to the utmost limit that military exigencies will\r\nallow that men who have been already associated in this or that district\r\nin training and in common exercises should be kept together and continue\r\nto recognize the corporate bond which now unites them. [\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\nAnd of one thing further I am sure. We are in urgent need of competent\r\nofficers, and we think that if the officers now engaged in training\r\nthese men are proved equal to the test, there is no fear that their\r\nservices will not be gladly and gratefully retained. I repeat that the\r\nempire needs recruits, and needs them at once, that they may be fully\r\ntrained and equipped in time to take their part in what may well be the\r\ndecisive fields of the greatest struggle in the history of the world.\r\nThat is our immediate necessity, and no Irishman in responding to it\r\nneed be afraid that he is prejudicing the future of the volunteers.\r\n[Cheers.] I do not say, and I can not say, under what precise form or\r\norganization, but I trust and believe, and indeed I am certain, that the\r\nvolunteers will become a permanent part, an integral and a\r\ncharacteristic part, of the defensive forces of the Crown. [Cheers.] I\r\nhave only one more thing to say to you. [Cries of \"Go on.\"] If our need\r\nis great your opportunity is also great. [Cheers.] The call which I am\r\nmaking is, as you know well, backed by the sympathy of your\r\nfellow-Irishmen in all parts of the empire and the world. Old\r\nanimosities between us are dead. [Loud and prolonged cheers.] Scattered\r\nlike the Autumn leaves to the four winds of heaven, we are a united\r\nnation, [renewed cheers,] owing and paying to our sovereign the\r\nheartfelt allegiance of men who at home not only love but enjoy for\r\nthemselves the liberty which our soldiers and our sailors are fighting\r\nby land and by sea to maintain and to extend for others. There is no\r\nquestion of compulsion or bribery. What we want we believe you are ready\r\nand eager to give as the free-will offering of a free people. [Great\r\ncheering.]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Meath, Lord Lieutenant of County Dublin, who was next called\r\non, declared that their gathering would be historic because for the\r\nfirst time in her history Irishmen of all classes, creeds, and politics\r\nhad met on the same platform. The modern Attila might be known, as his\r\npredecessor was known, as the scourge of God. But for the constant\r\nvigilance of our army and our fleet Ireland might have met the fate of\r\nBelgium. He suggested that Earl Kitchener should, as far as possible,\r\nsee that the Irish corps at the front should act together.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ASQUITH AT CARDIFF.\r\n\r\nSpeech in the Skating Rink, Oct. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the last month I have addressed meetings in London,\r\nEdinburgh, and Dublin, and now in the completion of the task which I set\r\nmyself and which the kindness of our great municipalities has allowed me\r\nto perform I have come to Cardiff. [Cheers.] England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland have each of them a definite and a well-established capital\r\ncity, but I have always understood that there was some doubt where the\r\ncapital of the Principality of Wales was to be found on the map.\r\n[Laughter.] Wales is a single and indivisible entity with a life of its\r\nown, drawing its vitality from an ancient past, and both, I believe, in\r\nthe volume and in the reality of its activity, never more virile than it\r\nis today. [Cheers.] But I do not know that there is any general\r\nagreement among Welshmen as to where their capital is to be found,\r\n[laughter, and a voice, \"Here,\"] and without attempting as an outsider\r\nto differentiate or to reconcile competing claims I stand here tonight\r\non what I believe to be a safe coign of vantage under the hospitality\r\nand the authority of the Lord Mayor of Cardiff.\r\n\r\nThough I am not altogether a stranger to Wales, you may nevertheless ask\r\nwhy I have requested your permission to address this great audience here\r\ntonight. I am not altogether an idle man, and during the last few months\r\nI can honestly say that there has hardly been a day, indeed there have\r\nbeen very few hours, which have not been preoccupied with grave cares\r\nand responsibility. But throughout them all I have been, and I am,\r\nsustained by a profound and unshakable belief in the righteousness of\r\nour cause [cheers] and by overwhelming evidence that in the pursuit and\r\nthe maintenance of that cause the Government have behind them, without\r\ndistinction of race, of party, or of class, the whole moral and material\r\nsupport of the British Empire. [Cheers.] Let me take the opportunity to\r\nacknowledge and to welcome the calm, reasoned, and dignified statement\r\nof our cause which the Christian Churches of the United Kingdom,\r\nthrough some of their most distinguished leaders and ministers, have\r\nthis week presented to the world. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe United Voice of the Empire.\r\n\r\nI will not repeat, and I certainly cannot improve upon it, and indeed I\r\nam not here tonight to argue out propositions which British citizens in\r\nevery part of the world today regard as beyond the reach of controversy.\r\nI do not suppose that in the history of mankind there has ever been in\r\nsuch a vast and diverse community agreement so unanimous in purpose and\r\nso concentrated, a corporate conscience so clear and so convinced,\r\nco-operation so spontaneous, so ardent, and so resolute. [Cheers.] Just\r\nconsider what it means, here in this United Kingdom--England, Scotland,\r\nIreland, and Wales--to hear one plain, harmonious, great united voice\r\nover the seas from our great dominions. [Cheers.] Canada, Australia,\r\nSouth Africa, New Zealand, our crown colonies, swell the chorus.\r\n\r\nIn India [cheers]--where whatever we won by the sword we hold and we\r\nretain by the more splendid title of just and disinterested rule by the\r\nauthority, not of a despot, but of a trustee [cheers]--the response to\r\nour common appeal has moved all our feelings to their profoundest\r\ndepths, and has been such as to shiver and to shatter the vain and\r\nignorant imaginings of our enemies. [Cheers,] That is a remarkable and\r\nindeed a unique spectacle.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that stirred the imagination, aroused the conscience,\r\nenlisted the manhood, welded into one compact and irresistible force the\r\nenergies and the greatest imperial structure that the world has ever\r\nknown? [Cheers.] That is a question which, for a moment at any rate, it\r\nis well worth asking and answering. Let me say, then, first negatively,\r\nthat we are not impelled, any of us, by some of the motives which have\r\noccasioned the bloody struggles of the past. In this case, so far as we\r\nare concerned, ambition and aggression play no part. What do we want?\r\nWhat do we aim at? What have we to gain?\r\n\r\nWe are a great, worldwide, peace-loving partnership. By the wisdom and\r\nthe courage of our forefathers, by great deeds of heroism and adventure\r\nby land and sea, by the insight and corporate sagacity, the tried and\r\ntested experience of many generations, we have built up a dominion which\r\nis buttressed by the two pillars of liberty and law. [Cheers.] We are\r\nnot vain enough or foolish enough to think that in the course of a long\r\nprocess there have not been blunders, or worse than blunders, and that\r\ntoday our dominion does not fall short of what in our ideals it might\r\nand it ought and, we believe, it is destined to be. But such as we have\r\nreceived it and such as we hope to have it, with it we are content.\r\n[Cheers.]\r\n\r\nWhy We Are at War.\r\n\r\nWe do not covet any people's territory. We have no desire to impose our\r\nrule upon alien populations. The British Empire is enough for us.\r\n[Laughter and cheers.] All that we wished for, all that we wish for now,\r\nis to be allowed peaceably to consolidate our own resources, to raise\r\nwithin the empire the level of common opportunity, to draw closer the\r\nbond of affection and confidence between its parts, and to make it\r\neverywhere the worthy home of the best traditions of British liberty.\r\n[Cheers.] Does it not follow from that that nowhere in the world is\r\nthere a people who have stronger motives to avoid war and to seek and\r\nensue peace? Why, then, are the British people throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of our empire everywhere turning their plowshares into swords?\r\nWhy are the best of our ablebodied men leaving the fields and the\r\nfactory and the counting house for the recruiting office and the\r\ntraining camp?\r\n\r\nIf, as I have said, we have no desire to add to our imperial burdens,\r\neither in area or in responsibility, it is equally true that in entering\r\nthis war we had no ill-will to gratify nor wrongs of our own to avenge.\r\n[\"Hear, hear!\"] In regard to Germany in particular [groans] our\r\npolicy--repeatedly stated in Parliament, resolutely pursued year after\r\nyear both in London and in Berlin--our policy has been to remove one by\r\none the outstanding causes of possible friction and so to establish a\r\nfirm basis for cordial relations in the days to come.\r\n\r\nWe have said from the first--I have said it over and over again, and so\r\nhas Sir Edward Grey--we have said from the first that our friendships\r\nwith certain powers, with France, [cheers,] with Russia, and with Japan,\r\nwere not to be construed as implying cold feelings and still less\r\nhostile purposes against any other power. But at the same time we have\r\nalways made it clear, to quote words used by Sir Edward Grey as far back\r\nas November, 1911--I quote his exact words--\"One does not make new\r\nfriendships worth having by deserting old ones.\" New friendships by all\r\nmeans let us have, but not at the expense of the ones we have. That has\r\nbeen, and I trust will always be, the attitude of those whom the Kaiser\r\nin his now notorious proclamation describes as the treacherous English.\r\n[Laughter and \"Oh, oh!\"]\r\n\r\nGermany's Demand in 1912.\r\n\r\nWe laid down, and I wish to call not only your attention but the\r\nattention of the whole world to this, when so many false legends are now\r\nbeing invented and circulated, in the following year--in the year\r\n1912--we laid down in terms carefully approved by the Cabinet, and which\r\nI will textually quote, what our relations with Germany ought in our\r\nview to be. We said, and we communicated this to the German Government,\r\n\"Britain declares that she will neither make nor join in any unprovoked\r\nattack upon Germany. Aggression upon Germany is not the subject and\r\nforms no part of any treaty, understanding, or combination to which\r\nBritain is now a party, nor will she become a party to anything that has\r\nsuch an object.\" There is nothing ambiguous or equivocal about that.\r\n[\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\n\r\nBut that was not enough for German statesmanship. They wanted us to go\r\nfurther. They asked us to pledge ourselves absolutely to neutrality in\r\nthe event of Germany being engaged in war, and this, mind you, at a\r\ntime when Germany was enormously increasing both her aggressive and\r\ndefensive resources, and especially upon the sea. They asked us, to put\r\nit quite plainly, for a free hand, so far as we were concerned, when\r\nthey selected the opportunity to overbear, to dominate the European\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nTo such a demand but one answer was possible, and that was the answer we\r\ngave. [Cheers.] None the less we have continued during the whole of the\r\nlast two years, and never more energetically and more successfully than\r\nduring the Balkan crisis of last year, to work not only for the peace of\r\nEurope but for the creation of a better international atmosphere and a\r\nmore cordial co-operation between all the powers. [Cheers.] From both\r\npoints of view, that of our domestic interests as a kingdom and an\r\nempire, and that of our settled attitude and policy in the counsels of\r\nEurope, a war such as this, which injures the one and frustrates the\r\nother, was and could only be regarded as among the worst of\r\ncatastrophes--among the worst of catastrophes, but not the worst.\r\n[Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\"The Blackest Annals of Barbarism.\"\r\n\r\nFour weeks ago, speaking at the Guildhall, in the City of London, when\r\nthe war was still in its early days, I asked my fellow-countrymen with\r\nwhat countenance, with what conscience, had we basely chose to stand\r\naloof, we could have watched from day to day the terrible unrolling of\r\nevents--public faith shamelessly broken, the freedom of a small people\r\ntrodden in the dust, the wanton invasion of Belgium and then of France\r\nby hordes who leave behind them at every stage of their progress a\r\ndismal trail of savagery, of devastation, and of desecration worthy of\r\nthe blackest annals in the history of barbarism. [Cheers.] That was four\r\nweeks ago. The war has now lasted for sixty days, and every one of those\r\ndays has added to the picture its share of sombre and repulsive traits.\r\nWe now see clearly written down in letters of carnage and spoliation the\r\nreal aims and methods of this long-prepared and well-organized scheme\r\nAgainst the liberties of Europe. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nI say nothing of other countries. I pass no judgment upon them. But if\r\nwe here in Great Britain had abstained and remained neutral, forsworn\r\nour word, deserted our friends, faltered and compromised with the plain\r\ndictates of our duty--nay, if we had not shown ourselves ready to strike\r\nwith all our forces at the common enemy of civilization and freedom,\r\nthere would have been nothing left for our country but to veil her face\r\nin shame and to be ready in her turn--for her time would have come--to\r\nshare the doom which she would have richly deserved, and after centuries\r\nof glorious life to go down to her grave, unwept, unhonored, and unsung.\r\n[Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\nLet us gladly acknowledge what becomes clearer and clearer every day,\r\nthat the world is just as ready as it ever was, and no part of it\r\nreadier than the British Empire, to understand and to respond to moral\r\nissues. [Cheers.] The new school of German thought has been teaching for\r\na generation past that in the affairs of nations there is no code of\r\nethics. According to their doctrine force and nothing but force is the\r\ntest and the measure of right. As the events which are going on before\r\nour eyes have made it plain, they have succeeded only too well in\r\nindoctrinating with their creed--I will not say the people of Germany;\r\nlike Burke, I will not attempt to draw up an indictment against a\r\nnation--I will not say the people of Germany, but those who control and\r\nexecute German policy. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nBut it is one of those products of German genius which, whether or not\r\nit was intended exclusively for home consumption, [laughter,] has not, I\r\nam happy to say, found a market abroad, and certainly not within the\r\nboundaries of the British Empire. [Cheers.] We still believe here,\r\nold-fashioned people as we are, in the sanctity of treaties, [cheers,]\r\nthat the weak have rights and that the strong have duties, that small\r\nnationalities have every bit as good a title as large ones to life and\r\nindependence, and that freedom for its own sake is as well worth\r\nfighting for today as it ever was in the past. [Cheers.] And we look\r\nforward at the end of this war to a Europe in which these great and\r\nsimple and venerable truths will be recognized and safeguarded forever\r\nagainst the recrudescence of the era of blood and iron. [Cheers.] Stated\r\nin a few words that is the reason for our united front, the reason that\r\nhas brought our gallant Indian warriors to Marseilles, that is\r\nextracting from our most distant dominions the best of their manhood,\r\nand which in the course of two months has transformed the United Kingdom\r\ninto a vast recruiting ground. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nGreatest Emergency in Our History.\r\n\r\nNow I have come here tonight not to talk but to do business. [Laughter\r\nand cheers.] Before I sit down I want to say to you a few practical\r\nwords. We are confronted, as you all know and recognize, by the greatest\r\nemergency in our history. Every part of the United Kingdom and every man\r\nand every woman in every part of it is called upon to make his or her\r\ncontribution and to do his or her share, [cheers,] and our primary\r\nbusiness is to fill the ranks. There is, I find, in some quarters an\r\napprehension that the recruiting for the new army and the functions to\r\nbe assigned to that army when it is formed and trained may interfere\r\nwith or may in some way belittle or disparage the territorial force.\r\nBelieve me, no delusion could be more mischievous or more complete.\r\n\r\nNo praise could be too high for the patriotic and sustained efforts of\r\nthe county associations or for the quality and efficiency of the\r\nterritorial troops. It is a comparatively easy thing to make great\r\nefforts and sacrifices under the stress and strain, which we are now\r\nexperiencing, of a supreme crisis. The territorials, without any such\r\nstimulus in the piping times of peace, when war and the sufferings and\r\nthe struggles and glories of war were contingent and remote, these men\r\ngave their time, sacrificed their leisure--not only in their annual\r\ntraining, but in thousands of cases both officers and men devoted their\r\nspare hours to preparing themselves in the study and the practice of the\r\nart of war. They have now been embodied for two months, and I am\r\nexpressing the considered opinion of one of the most eminent Generals\r\nwhen I say that the divisions now in camp in various parts of the\r\ncountry, and improving every day in efficiency, have completely\r\njustified their title to play any part that may be assigned to them,\r\neither in home defense, in the manning of our garrisons, or in the\r\nbattle lines at the front. [Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\nIt is, then, no want of appreciation of the patriotism and of the\r\nefficiency of the territorial forces that leads me to ask you tonight\r\nfor recruits for the regular army. We wish, so far as military\r\nexigencies permit, that the new battalions and squadrons and batteries\r\nshould retain their local associations and their corporate and\r\ndistinctive national character. [Cheers.] Why, the freedom and the\r\nautonomy of the smaller nationalities is one of the great issues of this\r\ngigantic contest.\r\n\r\nA Welsh Army Corps.\r\n\r\nI went a week ago to Dublin to make an appeal to Ireland. I asked\r\nIrishmen then, as I do now, on behalf of the Government and of the War\r\nOffice, to enlist in and to make up the complement of an Irish army\r\ncorps. I repeat that appeal tonight to the men of Wales. [Cheers.] We\r\nwant that. We want you to fill up the ranks of the Welsh army corps.\r\n[Cheers.] We believe that the preservation of local and national ties,\r\nof the genius of a people which has a history of its own, is not only\r\nnot hostile to or inconsistent with, but, on the contrary, fosters and\r\nstrengthens and stimulates the spirit of a common purpose, of, a\r\ncorporate brotherhood, of an underlying and binding imperial unity\r\nthroughout every section and among all ranks of the forces of the Crown.\r\n[Cheers.]\r\n\r\nMen of Wales, of whom I see so many thousands in this splendid\r\ngathering, let me say one last word to you. Remember your past.\r\n[Cheers.] Think of the villages and the mountains which in old days were\r\nthe shelter of the recruiting ground of your fathers in the struggles\r\nwhich adorn and glorify your annals. Never has a stronger or a more\r\ncompelling appeal been made to you of all that you as a nation honor and\r\nhold true. Be worthy of those who went before you, and leave to your\r\nchildren the richest of all inheritances--the memory of fathers who in a\r\ngreat cause put self-sacrifice before ease and honor above life itself.\r\n[Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\nLord Plymouth moved a resolution pledging support to the Prime\r\nMinister's appeal to the nation and to measures necessary for the\r\nprosecution of the war to a victorious conclusion, whereby alone the\r\nlasting peace of Europe could be assured.\r\n\r\nThomas Richards, M.P., seconded the resolution, which was carried with\r\nenthusiasm. The meeting concluded with the singing of \"Men of Harlech\"\r\nand the national anthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD CURZON'S EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\nUnion of All Parties Noted in Letter to The London Times.\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of The Times_:\r\n\r\n     Sir: Perhaps, after an experience of ten days in which I have had\r\n     the opportunity of speaking nightly about the war to great\r\n     audiences of my fellow-countrymen in places so wide apart but so\r\n     populous and important as Hull, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Dundee, Reading,\r\n     and other towns, I may be permitted to send you a few observations\r\n     on the subject of the campaign for which I pleaded in your columns\r\n     a fortnight ago, and which has been prosecuted energetically by a\r\n     multitude of speakers ever since.\r\n\r\n     In the first place, the meetings have shown the absolute fusion of\r\n     all parties and the disappearance of all minor issues in the face\r\n     of a national crisis. In each case the chair has been taken by the\r\n     Lord Mayor or Lord Provost or civic head of the town. On the\r\n     platform have been seated members of all parties and denominations;\r\n     and Lords Lieutenant, M.P.'s of all sides, including labor members,\r\n     and representative clergy, have addressed the meetings. The\r\n     interest taken by the people has been shown by the fact that the\r\n     largest halls, though sometimes holding audiences of 3,000 to 4,000\r\n     men and more, have been unable to accommodate the crowds, and in\r\n     every case overflow meetings have had to be held.\r\n\r\n     I have not found anywhere the slightest misapprehension as to the\r\n     causes of the war. The fears that were entertained that we should\r\n     be thought to be fighting on account of Servia or some remote\r\n     international quarrel, in which we were only indirectly engaged,\r\n     are groundless. The people realize clearly that we are fighting,\r\n     not merely for our own honor and good faith, but for ourselves and\r\n     our own national existence.\r\n\r\n     Further, I think that the policies and ideals which are represented\r\n     by our opponents are becoming much more widely understood. The\r\n     circulation of books such as von Bernhardi's and the clear\r\n     exposition on many platforms and in the press of the objects\r\n     preached with such amazing frankness by German writers for at least\r\n     thirty years and treated with such characteristic indifference by\r\n     ourselves are bearing fruit, and our people realize that German\r\n     victory is inconsistent not merely with the continued existence of\r\n     such an empire as ours, but with the conception of self-respect,\r\n     humanity and freedom upon which modern civilization and democratic\r\n     government in particular take their stand.\r\n\r\n     No doubt the German proceedings in Belgium have done much to\r\n     accelerate this conviction; and the mercilessness and savagery of\r\n     the methods by which the war has been fought by them (and for which\r\n     no vestige of an apology has been forthcoming) have taught men that\r\n     here is not only an enemy to be beaten but an evil spirit to be\r\n     driven out.\r\n\r\n     The response to the appeal for recruits has, on the whole, been\r\n     wonderful and inspiriting. Employers of labor, whether on a large\r\n     or a small scale, have, as a rule, behaved with generosity both as\r\n     regards releasing their employees and in making provision for them\r\n     and their families. A good example has been set by families and\r\n     persons in leading positions. Domestic servants have come forward\r\n     in great numbers. The working class population have awakened more\r\n     slowly--as was inevitable until the nature of the war and the\r\n     urgency of the call were brought clearly home to them--but are now\r\n     responding with alacrity. The brave deeds of their countrymen in\r\n     France have proved the surest stimulus, and disaster, as, for\r\n     instance, that reported to the Gordon Highlanders, at once raised\r\n     the tide of recruits. This is a very typical and encouraging\r\n     feature, showing that all that is wanted to convert interest into\r\n     enthusiasm and to blow the embers into flame is that the case\r\n     should be brought home by the sense of patriotic achievement or\r\n     national loss.\r\n\r\n     Unquestionably the two incidents that have appealed most to the\r\n     public sentiment have been the heroic resistance and tragic\r\n     sufferings of Belgium--to be compensated by all that our national\r\n     generosity can provide and atoned for by whatever reparation the\r\n     Allies think it ultimately right to exact--and the splendid\r\n     contribution from India. These events excite the loudest cheers and\r\n     touch the deepest chords of emotion.\r\n\r\n     In some cases, where recruiting has been slow, men have been\r\n     affected by a too exclusive but quite pardonable regard for the\r\n     interests of themselves and their families. The provision made from\r\n     various sources for the bread winner who has joined the colors or\r\n     is at the front might easily be made more generous. But the outlook\r\n     for those who are wounded or disabled, or for the families of those\r\n     who lose their lives, and perhaps most of all for those who on\r\n     their return may find it difficult to secure re-employment, is\r\n     thought by many to be insufficiently assured. Private employers and\r\n     business firms have, on the whole, met the situation with\r\n     liberality; and a similar attitude on the part of the Government\r\n     would meet with its immediate reward. It is perhaps a selfish\r\n     utterance if a man is heard to say, \"How am I going to come out of\r\n     it?\" or still more, \"What good is it going to do to me?\"; but if he\r\n     put the same question on behalf of those who depend upon him for\r\n     subsistence he is entitled to a definite and a not ungenerous\r\n     reply.\r\n\r\n     Two dangers may have to be faced as the war proceeds. One is that\r\n     the nation, exhilarated by smaller successes, may think that the\r\n     war will soon be over, and that no excessive effort is therefore\r\n     required. Traces of this feeling are sometimes visible in the\r\n     published letters (how admirable, as a rule, they are!) of soldiers\r\n     at the front, telling their families to expect them back in a month\r\n     or two's time. The other danger is that, harassed by the\r\n     continuance of the struggle, or attracted by delusive offers of\r\n     peace or affected by economic or industrial conditions which have\r\n     fortunately not so far developed, a section of the nation may cry\r\n     out for peace before the victory has been consummated and before\r\n     the peril we are fighting to avert is forever destroyed.\r\n\r\n     It may be that renewed platform activity may be required as time\r\n     goes on to sustain the spirit and fortify the constancy of the\r\n     nation. In the meanwhile, speakers, from my experience, cannot do\r\n     better than dilate upon the immense magnitude of the stakes\r\n     involved, and probable long duration of the struggle, and the\r\n     supreme importance that our country should, by the strength and\r\n     effectiveness of its material contribution to the common cause,\r\n     exercise a powerful influence both upon the issue of the struggle\r\n     and in the resettlement of territories and forces which will follow\r\n     upon its conclusion. I am, Sir, yours obediently,\r\n\r\n     CURZON OF KEDLESTON.\r\n\r\n     1 Carlton House Terrace, Sept. 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W.L.

I am quite sure I associate\r\nmy two friends who are here tonight and who are to speak after me, and\r\nmy noble friend, your Chairman, with me when I say that we regard the\r\ncheers with which you have received us as being offered to us only\r\nbecause they are meant for our soldiers in the field and our sailors\r\nupon the sea, [cheers,] and it is in that sense that we accept them and\r\nthank you for them.\r\n\r\nWe meet here together in serious times, but I come to you tonight in\r\ngood heart, [cheers,] and with good confidence for the future and for\r\nthe task upon which we are engaged. It is too soon to speculate upon the\r\nresults of the great battle which is waging in France. Everything that\r\nwe have heard, during four long days of anxiety seems to point to a\r\nmarked and substantial turning of the tide.\r\n\r\nGerman Plans Miscarried.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the forces of the French and British Armies strong enough\r\nnot only to contain and check the devastating avalanche which had swept\r\nacross the French frontier, but now at last, not for an hour or for a\r\nday, but for four long days in succession, it has been rolled steadily\r\nback. [Cheers.] With battles taking place over a front of 100 or 150\r\nmiles one must be very careful not to build high hopes on results which\r\nare achieved even in a great area of the field of war. We are not\r\nchildren looking for light and vain encouragement, but men engaged upon\r\na task which has got to be put through. Still, when every allowance has\r\nbeen made for the uncertainty with which these great operations are\r\nalways enshrouded, I think it only fair and right to say that the\r\nsituation tonight is better, far better, than a cold calculation of the\r\nforces available on both sides before the war should have led us to\r\nexpect at this early stage. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that what is happening now is not what the Germans\r\nplanned, [laughter,] and they have yet to show that they can adapt\r\nthemselves to the force of circumstances created by the military power\r\nof their enemies with the same efficiency that they have undoubtedly\r\nshown in regard to plans long prepared, methodically worked out, and\r\nexecuted with the precision of deliberation.\r\n\r\nThe battle, I say, gives us every reason to meet together tonight in\r\ngood heart. But let me tell you frankly that if this battle had been as\r\ndisastrous as, thank God, it appears to be triumphant, I should come\r\nbefore you with unabated confidence and with the certainty that we have\r\nonly to continue in our efforts to bring this war to the conclusion\r\nwhich we wish and intend. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nWe did not enter upon this war with the hope of easy victory; we did not\r\nenter upon it in any desire to extend our territory, or to advance and\r\nincrease our position in the world; or in any romantic desire to shed\r\nour blood and spend our money in Continental quarrels. We entered upon\r\nthis war reluctantly after we had made every effort compatible with\r\nhonor to avoid being drawn in, and we entered upon it with a full\r\nrealization of the sufferings, losses, disappointments, vexations, and\r\nanxieties, and of the appalling and sustained exertions which would be\r\nentailed upon us by our action. The war will be long and sombre. It will\r\nhave many reverses of fortune and many hopes falsified by subsequent\r\nevents, and we must derive from our cause and from the strength that is\r\nin us, and from the traditions and history of our race, and from the\r\nsupport and aid of our empire all over the world the means to make this\r\ncountry overcome obstacles of all kinds and continue to the end of the\r\nfurrow, whatever the toil and suffering may be.\r\n\r\nMaking Sure of Victory.\r\n\r\nBut though we entered this war with no illusions as to the incidents\r\nwhich will mark its progress, as to the ebb and flow of fortune in this\r\nand that part of the gigantic field over which it is waged, we entered\r\nit, and entered it rightly, with the sure and strong hope and\r\nexpectation of bringing it to a victorious conclusion. [Cheers.] I am\r\nquite certain that if we, the people of the British Empire, choose,\r\nwhatever may happen in the interval, we can in the end make this war\r\nfinish in accordance with our interests and the interests of\r\ncivilization. [Cheers.] Let us build on a sure foundation. Let us not\r\nbe the sport of fortune, looking for victories here and happy chances\r\nthere; let us take measures, which are well within our power, which are\r\npractical measures, measures which we can begin upon at once and carry\r\nthrough from day to day with surety and effect. Let us enter upon\r\nmeasures which in the long run, whatever the accidents and incidents of\r\nthe intervening period may be, will secure us that victory upon which\r\nour life and existence as a nation not less than the fortune of our\r\nallies and of Europe absolutely depends. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe Deeds of the Navy.\r\n\r\nI think we are building on a sure foundation. [Cheers.] Let us look\r\nfirst at the navy. [Cheers.] The war has now been in progress between\r\nfive and six weeks. In that time we have swept German commerce from the\r\nseas. [Cheers.] We have either blocked in neutral harbors or blockaded\r\nin their own harbors [laughter] or hunted down the commerce destroyers\r\nof which we used to hear so much and from which we anticipated such\r\nserious loss and damage. All our ships, with inconsiderable exceptions,\r\nare arriving safely and punctually at their destinations, carrying on\r\nthe commerce upon which the wealth and industry and the power of making\r\nwar for this country depends. We are transporting easily, not without an\r\nelement of danger, but hitherto safely and successfully, great numbers\r\nof soldiers across the seas from all quarters of the world to be\r\ndirected upon the decisive theatre of the land struggle. [A voice,\r\n\"Russians,\" and laughter.] And we have searched the so-called German\r\nOcean without discovering the German flag. [Cheers.] Our enemies, in\r\ntheir carefully worked out calculations, which they have been toiling\r\nover during a great many years, when the people of this country, as a\r\nwhole, credited them with quite different motives, [\"Hear, hear!\"] have\r\nalways counted upon a process of attrition and the waste of shipping by\r\nmines and torpedoes and other methods of warfare of the weaker power, by\r\nwhich the numbers and strength of our fleet would be reduced to such a\r\npoint that they would be able to steel their hearts and come out and\r\nfight. [Cheers.] We have been at war for five or six weeks, and so\r\nfar--though I would certainly not underrate the risks and hazards\r\nattending upon warlike operations and the vanity of all\r\noverconfidence--but so far the attrition has been on their side and not\r\non ours, [cheers,] while the losses which they have suffered greatly\r\nexceed any that we have at present sustained.\r\n\r\nI have made careful inquiries as to the condition of our sailors in the\r\nfleet under the strain put upon them, and this continued watching and\r\nconstant attention to their duty under war conditions, and I am glad to\r\nsay that it is reported to me that the health of the fleet has been much\r\nbetter since the declaration of war than it was in time of peace, [loud\r\ncheers and laughter,] both as to the percentage of sickness and the\r\ncharacter of the sickness, [laughter,] and that there is no reason why\r\nwe should not keep up the same process of naval control and have the\r\nsame exercises of sea power, on which we have lived and are living, for\r\nwhat is almost an indefinite period.\r\n\r\nThe Nose of the Bulldog.\r\n\r\nBy one of those dispensations of Providence, which appeals so strongly\r\nto the German Emperor, [laughter,] the nose of the bulldog has been\r\nslanted backward so that he can breathe with comfort without letting go.\r\n[Laughter and cheers.] We have been successful in maintaining naval\r\ncontrol thus far in the struggle, and there are also sound reasons for\r\nbelieving that as it progresses the chances in our favor will not\r\ndiminish but increase. In the next 12 months the number of great ships\r\nthat will be completed for this country is more than double the number\r\nwhich will be completed for Germany, [cheers,] and the number of\r\ncruisers three or four times as great. [Cheers.] Therefore I think I am\r\non solid ground when I come here tonight and say that you may count upon\r\nthe naval supremacy of this country being effectively maintained as\r\nagainst the German power for as long as you wish. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe Army's Share.\r\n\r\nNow we must look at the army....\r\n\r\n     [Transcriber's Note:\r\n     Interlinear typesetter's error indicated by ellipses.]\r\n\r\n... Government and during all periods of modern history the darling of\r\nthe British Nation. On it have been lavished whatever public funds were\r\nnecessary, and to its efficiency has been devoted the unceasing care and\r\nthought of successive Administrations. The result is that when the need\r\ncame the navy was absolutely ready, [cheers,] and, as far as we can see\r\nfrom what has happened, thoroughly adequate to the task which was\r\nrequired from it. But we have not been in times of peace a military\r\nnation. The army has not had the facilities of obtaining the lavish\r\nsupplies of men and money for its needs which have in times of peace and\r\nin the past, to our good fortune at the moment, been so freely given to\r\nthe navy. And what you have to do now is to make a great army. [Cheers.]\r\nYou have to make an army under the cover and shield of the navy strong\r\nenough to enable our country to play its full part in the decision of\r\nthis terrible struggle. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nA Million Men Needed.\r\n\r\nThe sure way--the only sure way--to bring this war to an end is for the\r\nBritish Empire to put on the Continent and keep on the Continent an army\r\nof at least 1,000,000 men. [Cheers.] I take that figure because it is\r\none well within the compass of the arrangements which are now on foot\r\nand because it is one which is well within the scope of the measures\r\nwhich Lord Kitchener--[Loud cheers drowned the rest of the sentence.]\r\n\r\nI was reading in the newspapers the other day that the German Emperor\r\nmade a speech to some of his regiments in which he urged them to\r\nconcentrate their attention upon what he was pleased to call \"French's\r\ncontemptible little army.\" [Laughter.] Well, they are concentrating\r\ntheir attention upon it [laughter and cheers] and that army, which has\r\nbeen fighting with such extraordinary prowess, which has revived in a\r\nfortnight of adverse actions the ancient fame and glory of our arms\r\nupon the Continent, [cheers,] and which tonight, after a long,\r\nprotracted, harassed, unbroken, and undaunted rearguard action--the\r\nhardest trial to which troops can be exposed--is advancing in spite of\r\nthe loss of one-fifth of its numbers, and driving its enemies before\r\nit--that army must be reinforced and backed and supported and increased\r\nand enlarged in numbers, in power by every means and every method that\r\nevery one of us can employ.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why, if you set yourselves to it--I have not come\r\nhere to make a speech of words, but to point out to you necessary and\r\nobvious things which you can do--there is no doubt that, if you set\r\nyourselves to it, the army which is now fighting so valiantly on your\r\nbehalf and our allies can be raised from its present position to 250,000\r\nof the finest professional soldiers in the world, and that in the new\r\nyear something like 500,000 men, and from that again when the early\r\nSummer begins in 1915 to the full figure of twenty-five army corps\r\nfighting in line together. The vast population of these islands and all\r\nthe empire is pressing forward to serve, its wealth is placed at your\r\ndisposal, the navy opens the way for the passage of men and everything\r\nnecessary for the equipment of our forces. Why should we hesitate when\r\nhere is the sure and certain path to ending this war in the way we mean\r\nit to end? [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nA Decisive Weight.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that an army so formed will in quality and\r\ncharacter, in native energy, in the comprehension which each individual\r\nhas of the cause for which he is fighting, exceed in merit any army in\r\nthe world. We have only to have a chance of even numbers or anything\r\napproaching even numbers to demonstrate the superiority of\r\nfree-thinking, active citizens over the docile sheep who serve the\r\nferocious ambitions of drastic Kings. [Cheers.] Our enemies are now at\r\nthe point which we have reached fully extended. On every front of the\r\nenormous field of conflict the pressure upon them is such that all their\r\nresources are deployed. With every addition to the growing weight of\r\nthe Russian Army, [cheers,] with every addition to the forces at the\r\ndisposal of Sir John French, [cheers,] the balance must sag down\r\nincreasingly against them.\r\n\r\nFixing a Term to the War.\r\n\r\nYou have only to create steadily week by week and month by month the\r\ngreat military instrument of which I have been speaking to throw into\r\nthe scales a weight which must be decisive. There will be no\r\ncorresponding reserve of manhood upon which Germany can draw. There will\r\nbe no corresponding force of soldiers and of equipment and of war\r\nmaterial which can be brought into the line to face the forces which we\r\nin this island and in this empire can undoubtedly create. That will turn\r\nthe scale. That will certainly decide the issue. Of course, if victory\r\ncomes sooner so much the better. [Cheers.] But let us not count on\r\nfortune and good luck. [Cheers.] Let us assume at every point that\r\nthings will go much less well than we hope and wish. Let us make\r\narrangements which will override that. [Cheers.] We have it in our power\r\nto make such arrangements, and it is only common prudence, aye, and\r\ncommon humanity, to take steps which at any rate will fix some certain\r\nterm to this devastating struggle throughout the whole of the European\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nLet me also say this. Let us concentrate all our warlike feeling upon\r\nfighting the enemy in the field and creating a great military weapon to\r\ncarry out the purposes of the war. There is a certain class of person\r\nwho likes to work his warlike feelings off upon the unfortunate alien\r\nenemy within our gates.\r\n\r\nFight Like Gentlemen.\r\n\r\nOf course all necessary measures must be taken for the security of the\r\ncountry and for the proper carrying out of military needs; but let us\r\nalways have this feeling in our heart that after the war is over people\r\nshall not only admire our victory but they shall say they fought like\r\ngentlemen. [Cheers.] The Romans had a motto--\r\n\r\n     _Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos._\r\n\r\nLet that be the spirit in which we conduct this war. Let all those who\r\nfeel under the horrible provocations of the struggle their hearts\r\nsuffused with anger and with wrath--let them turn it into a practical\r\nchannel--going to the front or if circumstances prevent them, helping\r\nothers to go, keeping them maintained in the highest state of\r\nefficiency, giving them the supplies and weapons which they require, and\r\nlooking after those they have left behind.\r\n\r\nThe Eloquence of Brutal Facts.\r\n\r\nI have not spoken to you much about the justice of our cause, because it\r\nhas been most eloquently set out by the Prime Minister, [cheers,] and\r\nSir Edward Grey, [cheers,] and by Mr. Bonar Law, [cheers,] and other\r\nleaders of the Opposition; and much more eloquently than by any speakers\r\nin this or any other country the justice of our cause has been set out\r\nby the brutal facts which have occurred and which have marched upon us\r\nfrom day to day. [Cheers.] Some thought there would be a German war,\r\nsome did not; but no one supposed that a great military nation would\r\nexhibit all the vices of military organization without those redeeming\r\nvirtues which, God knows, are needed to redeem warlike operations from\r\nthe taint of shame. We have been confronted with an exhibition of\r\nruthlessness and outrage enforced upon the weak, enforced upon women and\r\nchildren. We have been confronted with repeated breaches of the law of\r\nenlightened warfare, practices analogous to those which in private life\r\nare regarded as cheating, and which deprive persons or country adopting\r\nthem, or condoning them, of the credit and respect due to honorable\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nWe have been confronted with all this. Let us not imitate it. [Cheers.]\r\nLet us not try to make small retaliations and reprisals here and there.\r\nLet us concentrate upon the simple, obvious task of creating a military\r\nforce so powerful that the war, even in default of any good fortune, can\r\ncertainly be ended and brought to a satisfactory conclusion. However the\r\nwar began, now that it is started it is a war of self-preservation for\r\nus. Our civilization, our way of doing things, our political and\r\nParliamentary life, with its voting and its thinking, our party system,\r\nour party warfare, the free and easy tolerance of British life, our\r\nmethod of doing things and of keeping ourselves alive and\r\nself-respecting in the world--all these are brought into contrast, into\r\ncollision, with the organized force of bureaucratic Prussian militarism.\r\n\r\nThat is the struggle which is opened now and which must go forward\r\nwithout pause or abatement until it is settled decisively and finally\r\none way or the other. On that there can be no compromise or truce. It is\r\nour life or it is theirs. We are bound, having gone so far, to go\r\nforward without flinching to the very end. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\"The Terror of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the same great European war that would have fought in the year\r\n1909 if Russia had not humbled herself and given way to German threats.\r\nIt is the same war that Sir Edward Grey stopped last year. [Loud\r\ncheers.] Now it has come upon us. If you look back across the long\r\nperiods of European history to the original cause, you will, I am sure,\r\nfind it in the cruel terms enforced upon France in the year 1870,\r\n[\"Hear, hear!\"] and in the repeated bullyings and attempts to terrorize\r\nFrance which have been the characteristic of German policy ever since.\r\n[Cheers.] The more you study this question the more you will see that\r\nthe use the Germans made of their three aggressive and victorious wars\r\nagainst Denmark, against Austria, and against France has been such as to\r\nmake them the terror and the bully of Europe, the enemy and the menace\r\nof every small State upon their borders, and a perpetual source of\r\nunrest and disquietude to their powerful neighbors. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nClaims of Nationality.\r\n\r\nNow the war has come, and when it is over let us be careful not to make\r\nthe same mistake or the same sort of mistake as Germany made when she\r\nhad France prostrate at her feet in 1870. [Cheers.] Let us, whatever we\r\ndo, fight for and work toward great and sound principles for the\r\nEuropean system. And the first of those principles which we should keep\r\nbefore us is the principle of nationality [cheers]--that is to say, not\r\nthe conquest or subjugation of any great community or of any strong race\r\nof men, but the setting free of those races which have been subjugated\r\nand conquered [cheers]; and if doubt arises about disputed areas of\r\ncountry we should try to settle their ultimate destination in the\r\nreconstruction of Europe which must follow from this war with a fair\r\nregard to the wishes and feelings of the people who live in them.\r\n\r\nThat is the aim which, if it is achieved, will justify the exertions of\r\nthe war and will make some amends to the world for the loss and\r\nsuffering, the agony of suffering, which it has wrought and entailed,\r\nand which will give to those who come after us not only the pride which\r\nwe hope they will feel in remembering the martial achievements of the\r\npresent age of Britain, but which will give them also a better and\r\nfairer world to live in and a Europe free from the causes of hatred and\r\nunrest which have poisoned the comity of nations and ruptured the peace\r\nof Christendom.\r\n\r\nThe Unity of the Empire.\r\n\r\nI use these words because this is a war in which we are all together,\r\n[cheers,] all classes, all races, all States, principalities, dominions,\r\nand powers throughout the British Empire--we are all together. [Cheers.]\r\nYears ago the elder Pitt urged upon his countrymen the compulsive\r\ninvocation, \"Be one people.\" It has taken us till now to obey his\r\nappeal, but now we are together, and while we remain one people there\r\nare no forces in the world strong enough to beat us down or break us up.\r\n[Cheers.]\r\n\r\nI hope, even in this dark hour of strife and struggle, that the unity\r\nwhich has been established in our country under the pressure of war will\r\nnot cease when the great military effort upon which we are engaged and\r\nthe great moral causes which we are pursuing have been achieved. I hope,\r\nand I do not think my hope is a vain one, that the forces which have\r\ncome together in our islands and throughout our empire may continue to\r\nwork together, not only in a military struggle, but to try to make our\r\ncountry more quickly a more happy and more prosperous land, where social\r\njustice and free institutions are more firmly established than they have\r\nbeen in the past. [Cheers.] If that is so we shall not have fought in\r\nvain at home as well as abroad.\r\n\r\nWith these hopes and in this belief I would urge you, laying aside all\r\nhindrance, thrusting away all private aims, to devote yourselves\r\nunswervingly and unflinchingly to the vigorous and successful\r\nprosecution of the war. [Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT WAR.\r\n\r\nSpeech by David Lloyd George, Chancellor of the Exchequer, at Queen's\r\nHall, London, Sept. 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have come here this afternoon to talk\r\nto my fellow-countrymen about this great war and the part that we ought\r\nto take in it. I feel my task is easier after we have been listening to\r\nthe greatest war song in the world (\"The March of the Men of Harlech\").\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nWhy Our National Honor Is Involved.\r\n\r\nThere is no man in this room who has always regarded the prospect of\r\nengaging in a great war with greater reluctance and with greater\r\nrepugnance than I have done throughout the whole of my political life.\r\n[\"Hear, hear!\"] There is no man either inside or outside of this room\r\nmore convinced that we could not have avoided it without national\r\ndishonor. [Great applause.] I am fully alive to the fact that every\r\nnation who has ever engaged in any war has always invoked the sacred\r\nname of honor. Many a crime has been committed in its name; there are\r\nsome being committed now. All the same, national honor is a reality,\r\nand any nation that disregards it is doomed. [\"Hear, hear!\"] Why is our\r\nhonor as a country involved in this war? Because, in the first instance,\r\nwe are bound by honorable obligations to defend the independence, the\r\nliberty, the integrity, of a small neighbor that has always lived\r\npeaceably. [Applause.] She could not have compelled us; she was weak;\r\nbut the man who declines to discharge his duty because his creditor is\r\ntoo poor to enforce it is a blackguard. [Loud applause.] We entered into\r\na treaty--a solemn treaty--two treaties--to defend Belgium and her\r\nintegrity. Our signatures are attached to the documents. Our signatures\r\ndo not stand alone there; this country was not the only country that\r\nundertook to defend the integrity of Belgium. Russia, France, Austria,\r\nPrussia--they are all there. Why are Austria and Prussia not performing\r\nthe obligations of their bond? It is suggested that when we quote this\r\ntreaty it is purely an excuse on our part--it is our low craft and\r\ncunning to cloak our jealousy of a superior civilization--[Laughter]--that\r\nwe are attempting to destroy. Our answer is the action we took in 1870.\r\n[\"Hear, hear!\"] What was that? Mr. Gladstone was then Prime Minister.\r\n[Applause.] Lord Granville, I think, was then Foreign Secretary. I have\r\nnever heard it laid to their charge that they were ever Jingoes.\r\n\r\nFrance and Belgium in 1870.\r\n\r\nWhat did they do in 1870? That treaty bound us then. We called upon the\r\nbelligerent powers to respect it. We called upon France, and we called\r\nupon Germany. At that time, bear in mind, the greatest danger to Belgium\r\ncame from France, and not from Germany. We intervened to protect Belgium\r\nagainst France, exactly as we are doing now to protect her against\r\nGermany. [Applause.] We proceeded in exactly the same way. We invited\r\nboth the belligerent powers to state that they had no intention of\r\nviolating Belgian territory. What was the answer given by Bismarck? He\r\nsaid it was superfluous to ask Prussia such a question in view of the\r\ntreaties in force. France gave a similar answer. We received at\r\nthat time the thanks of the Belgian people for our intervention in a\r\nvery remarkable document. It is a document addressed by the Municipality\r\nof Brussels to Queen Victoria after that intervention, and it reads:\r\n\r\n     The great and noble people over whose destinies you preside have\r\n     just given a further proof of its benevolent sentiment toward our\r\n     country.... The voice of the English nation has been heard above\r\n     the din of arms, and it has asserted the principles of justice and\r\n     right. Next to the unalterable attachment of the Belgian people to\r\n     their independence, the strongest sentiment which fills their\r\n     hearts is that of an imperishable gratitude. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nThat was in 1870. Mark what followed. Three or four days after that\r\ndocument of thanks a French army was wedged up against the Belgian\r\nfrontier, every means of escape shut out by a ring of flame from\r\nPrussian cannon. There was one way of escape. What was that? Violating\r\nthe neutrality of Belgium. What did they do? The French on that occasion\r\npreferred ruin and humiliation to the breaking of their bond. [Loud\r\napplause.] The French Emperor, the French Marshals, 100,000 gallant\r\nFrenchmen in arms, preferred to be carried captive to the strange land\r\nof their enemies rather than dishonor the name of their country.\r\n[Applause.] It was the last French army in the field. Had they violated\r\nBelgian neutrality the whole history of that war would have been\r\nchanged, and yet, when it was the interest of France to break the treaty\r\nthen, she did not do it.\r\n\r\n\"A Scrap of Paper.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the interest of Prussia today to break the treaty, and she has\r\ndone it. [Hisses.] She avows it with cynical contempt for every\r\nprinciple of justice. She says: \"Treaties only bind you when it is your\r\ninterest to keep them.\" [Laughter.] \"What is a treaty?\" says the German\r\nChancellor, \"A scrap of paper.\" Have you any five-pound notes about you?\r\n[Laughter and applause.] I am not calling for them. [Laughter.] Have you\r\nany of those neat little Treasury one-pound notes? [Laughter.] If you\r\nhave, burn them; they are only scraps of paper. [Laughter and\r\napplause.] What are they made of? Rags. [Laughter.] What are they worth?\r\nThe whole credit of the British Empire. [Loud applause.] Scraps of\r\npaper! I have been dealing with scraps of paper within the last month.\r\nOne suddenly found the commerce of the world coming to a standstill. The\r\nmachine had stopped. Why? I will tell you. We discovered--many of us for\r\nthe first time, for I do not pretend that I do not know much more about\r\nthe machinery of commerce today than I did six weeks ago, and there are\r\nmany others like me--we discovered that the machinery of commerce was\r\nmoved by bills of exchange. I have seen some of them, [laughter,]\r\nwretched, crinkled, scrawled over, blotched, frowsy, and yet those\r\nwretched little scraps of paper move great ships laden with thousands of\r\ntons of precious cargo from one end of the world to the other.\r\n[Applause.] What is the motive power behind them? The honor of\r\ncommercial men. [Applause.] Treaties are the currency of international\r\nstatesmanship. [Applause.] Let us be fair--German merchants, German\r\ntraders, have the reputation of being as upright and straightforward as\r\nany traders in the world, [\"Hear, hear\"] but if the currency of German\r\ncommerce is to be debased to the level of that of her statesmanship, no\r\ntrader from Shanghai to Valparaiso will ever look at a German signature\r\nagain. [Loud applause.] This doctrine of the scrap of paper, this\r\ndoctrine which is proclaimed by Bernhardi, that treaties only bind a\r\nnation as long as it is to its interest, goes under the root of all\r\npublic law. It is the straight road to barbarism. [\"Hear, hear!\"] It is\r\nas if you were to remove the magnetic pole because it was in the way of\r\na German cruiser. [Laughter.] The whole navigation of the seas would\r\nbecome dangerous, difficult, and impossible; and the whole machinery of\r\ncivilization will break down if this doctrine wins in this war. [\"Hear,\r\nhear!\"] We are fighting against barbarism, [applause,] and there is only\r\none way of putting it right. If there are nations that say they\r\nwill only respect treaties when it is to their interest to do so, we\r\nmust make it to their interest to do so for the future. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nGermany's Perjury.\r\n\r\nWhat is their defense? Consider the interview which took place between\r\nour Ambassador and the great German officials. When their attention was\r\ncalled to this treaty to which they were parties, they said: \"We cannot\r\nhelp that. Rapidity of action is the great German asset.\" There is a\r\ngreater asset for a nation than rapidity of action, and that is honest\r\ndealing. [Loud applause.] What are Germany's excuses? She says Belgium\r\nwas plotting against her; Belgium was engaged in a great conspiracy with\r\nBritain and France to attack her. Not merely is it not true, but Germany\r\nknows it is not true. [\"Hear, hear!\"] What is her other excuse. That\r\nFrance meant to invade Germany through Belgium. That is absolutely\r\nuntrue. [\"Hear, hear!\"] France offered Belgium five army corps to defend\r\nher if she were attacked. Belgium said: \"I do not require them; I have\r\nthe word of the Kaiser. Shall Caesar send a lie?\" [Laughter and\r\napplause.] All these tales about conspiracy have been vamped up since. A\r\ngreat nation ought to be ashamed to behave like a fraudulent bankrupt,\r\nperjuring its way through its obligations. [\"Hear, hear!\"] What she says\r\nis not true. She has deliberately broken this treaty, and we were in\r\nhonor bound to stand by it. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nBelgium's \"Crime.\"\r\n\r\nBelgium has been treated brutally. [\"Hear, hear!\"] How brutally we shall\r\nnot yet know. We already know too much. But what had she done? Had she\r\nsent an ultimatum to Germany? Had she challenged Germany? Was she\r\npreparing to make war on Germany? Had she inflicted any wrong upon\r\nGermany which the Kaiser was bound to redress? She was one of the most\r\nunoffending little countries in Europe. [\"Hear, hear!\"] There she\r\nwas--peaceable, industrious, thrifty, hard working, giving offense to\r\nno one. And her cornfields have been trampled, her villages have been\r\nburned, her art treasures have been destroyed, her men have been\r\nslaughtered--yea, and her women and children too. [Cries of \"Shame!\"]\r\nHundreds and thousands of her people, their neat, comfortable little\r\nhomes burned to the dust, are wandering homeless in their own land. What\r\nwas their crime? Their crime was that they trusted to the word of a\r\nPrussian King. [Applause.] I do not know what the Kaiser hopes to\r\nachieve by this war. [Derisive laughter.] I have a shrewd idea what he\r\nwill get; but one thing he has made certain, and that is that no nation\r\nwill ever commit that crime again.\r\n\r\n\"The Right to Defend Its Homes.\"\r\n\r\nI am not going to enter into details of outrages. Many of them are\r\nuntrue, and always are in a war. War is a grim, ghastly business at best\r\nor at worst, [\"Hear, hear!\"] and I am not going to say that all that has\r\nbeen said in the way of outrages must necessarily be true. I will go\r\nbeyond that, and I will say that if you turn two millions of\r\nmen--forced, conscript, compelled, driven--into the field, you will\r\nalways get among them a certain number who will do things that the\r\nnation to which they belong would be ashamed of. I am not depending on\r\nthese tales. It is enough for me to have the story which Germans\r\nthemselves avow, admit, defend and proclaim--the burning and massacring,\r\nthe shooting down of harmless people. Why? Because, according to the\r\nGermans, these people fired on German soldiers. What business had German\r\nsoldiers there at all? [\"Hear, hear!\" and applause.] Belgium was acting\r\nin pursuance of the most sacred right, the right to defend its homes.\r\nBut they were not in uniform when they fired! If a burglar broke into\r\nthe Kaiser's Palace at Potsdam, destroyed his furniture, killed his\r\nservants, ruined his art treasures--especially those he had made\r\nhimself, [laughter and applause], and burned the precious manuscripts of\r\nhis speeches, do you think he would wait until he got into uniform\r\nbefore he shot him down? [Laughter.] They were dealing with\r\nthose who had broken into their household. [\"Hear, hear!\"] But the\r\nperfidy of the Germans has already failed. They entered Belgium to save\r\ntime. The time has gone. [Loud and continued applause.] They have not\r\ngained time, but they have lost their good name. [\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\n\r\nThe Case of Servia.\r\n\r\nBut Belgium is not the only little nation that has been attacked in this\r\nwar, and I make no excuse for referring to the case of the other little\r\nnation, the case of Servia. [\"Hear, hear!\"] The history of Servia is not\r\nunblotted. Whose history, in the category of nations, is unblotted?\r\n[\"Hear, hear!\"] The first nation that is without sin, let her cast a\r\nstone at Servia. She was a nation trained in a horrible school, but she\r\nwon her freedom with a tenacious valor, and she has maintained it by the\r\nsame courage. [Applause.] If any Servians were mixed up in the\r\nassassination of the Grand Duke, they ought to be punished. [\"Hear,\r\nhear!\"] Servia admits that. The Servian Government had nothing to do\r\nwith it. Not even Austria claims that. The Servian Prime Minister is one\r\nof the most capable and honored men in Europe. [\"Hear, hear!\"] Servia\r\nwas willing to punish any one of her subjects who had been proved to\r\nhave any complicity in that assassination. What more could you expect?\r\nWhat were the Austrian demands? Servia sympathized with her\r\nfellow-countrymen in Bosnia--that was one of her crimes. She must do so\r\nno more. Her newspapers were saying nasty things about Austria; they\r\nmust do so no longer. That is the German spirit; you had it in Zabern.\r\n[\"Hear, hear!\" and applause.] How dare you criticise a Prussian\r\nofficial? [laughter,] and if you laugh, it is a capital offense--the\r\nColonel in Zabern threatened to shoot if it was repeated. In the same\r\nway the Servian newspapers must not criticise Austria. I wonder what\r\nwould have happened if we had taken the same line about German\r\nnewspapers. [\"Hear, hear!\"] Servia said: \"Very well, we will give orders\r\nto the newspapers that they must in future criticise neither Austria,\r\nnor Hungary, nor anything that is theirs.\" [Laughter.] Who can doubt the\r\nvalor of Servia, when she undertook to tackle her newspaper editors?\r\n[Laughter and applause.] She promised not to sympathize with Bosnia, she\r\npromised to write no critical articles about Austria; she would have no\r\npublic meetings in which anything unkind was said about Austria.\r\n\r\n\"Servia Faced the Situation with Dignity.\"\r\n\r\nBut that was not enough. She must dismiss from her army the officers\r\nwhom Austria should subsequently name. Those officers had just emerged\r\nfrom a war where they had added lustre to the Servian arms; they were\r\ngallant, brave, and efficient. [\"Hear, hear!\"] I wonder whether it was\r\ntheir guilt or their efficiency that prompted Austria's action! But,\r\nmark you, the officers were not named; Servia was to undertake in\r\nadvance to dismiss them from the army, the names to be sent in\r\nsubsequently. Can you name a country in the world that would have stood\r\nthat? [Cries of \"No.\"] Supposing Austria or Germany had issued an\r\nultimatum of that kind to this country, saying, \"You must dismiss from\r\nyour army, and from your navy, [laughter,] all those officers whom we\r\nshall subsequently name.\" Well, I think I could name them now.\r\n[Laughter.] Lord Kitchener [loud applause] would go. Sir John French\r\n[applause] would be sent away; Gen. Smith-Dorrien [applause] would go,\r\nand I am sure that Sir John Jellicoe [applause] would have to go. And\r\nthere is another gallant old warrior who would go, Lord Roberts.\r\n[Applause.] It was a difficult situation for a small country. Here was a\r\ndemand made upon her by a great military power that could have put half\r\na dozen men in the field for every one of Servia's men, and that power\r\nwas supported by the greatest military power in the world. How did\r\nServia behave? It is not what happens to you in life that matters; it is\r\nthe way in which you face it, [\"Hear, hear!\"] and Servia faced the\r\nsituation with dignity. She said to Austria: \"If any officers\r\nof mine have been guilty, and are proved to be guilty, I will dismiss\r\nthem.\" Austria said: \"That is not good enough for me.\" It was not guilt\r\nshe was after, but capacity. [\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\n\r\nRussia's Turn.\r\n\r\nThen came Russia's turn. Russia has a special regard for Servia; she has\r\na special interest in Servia. Russians have shed their blood for Servian\r\nindependence many a time, for Servia is a member of Russia's family, and\r\nshe cannot see Servia maltreated. Austria knew that. Germany knew it,\r\nand she turned round to Russia and said: \"I insist that you shall stand\r\nby with your arms folded while Austria is strangling your little brother\r\nto death.\" What answer did the Russian Slav give? He gave the only\r\nanswer that becomes a man. [\"Hear, hear!\"] He turned to Austria, and\r\nsaid: \"You lay hands on that little fellow, and I will tear your\r\nramshackle empire [loud applause and laughter] limb from limb.\" And he\r\nis doing it! [Loud applause.]\r\n\r\nThe Little Nations.\r\n\r\nThat is the story of two little nations. The world owes much to little\r\nnations--and to little men! [Laughter and applause.] This theory of\r\nbigness, this theory that you must have a big empire, and a big nation,\r\nand a big man--well, long legs have their advantage in a retreat.\r\n[Laughter and applause.] The Kaiser's ancestor chose his warriors for\r\ntheir height, and that tradition has become a policy in Germany. Germany\r\napplies that ideal to nations, and will only allow six-foot-two nations\r\nto stand in the ranks. [Laughter.] But ah! the world owes much to the\r\nlittle five-foot-five nations. The greatest art in the world was the\r\nwork of little nations; the most enduring literature of the world came\r\nfrom little nations; the greatest literature of England came when she\r\nwas a nation of the size of Belgium fighting a great empire. The heroic\r\ndeeds that thrill humanity through generations were the deeds of little\r\nnations fighting for their freedom. Yes, and the salvation of mankind\r\ncame through a little nation. God has chosen little nations as the\r\nvessels by which He carries His choicest wines to the lips of humanity,\r\nto rejoice their hearts, to exalt their vision, to stimulate and\r\nstrengthen their faith; and if we had stood by when two little nations\r\nwere being crushed and broken by the brutal hands of barbarism, our\r\nshame would have rung down the everlasting ages. [Loud applause.]\r\n\r\n\"The Test of Our Faith.\"\r\n\r\nBut Germany insists that this is an attack by a lower civilization upon\r\na higher one. [Derisive cries.] As a matter of fact, the attack was\r\nbegun by the civilization which calls itself the higher one. I am no\r\napologist for Russia; she has perpetrated deeds of which I have no doubt\r\nher best sons are ashamed. What empire has not? But Germany is the last\r\nempire to point the finger of reproach at Russia. [\"Hear, hear!\"] Russia\r\nhas made sacrifices for freedom--great sacrifices. Do you remember the\r\ncry of Bulgaria when she was torn by the most insensate tyranny that\r\nEurope has ever seen? Who listened to that cry? The only answer of the\r\nhigher civilization was that the liberty of the Bulgarian peasants was\r\nnot worth the life of a single Pomeranian grenadier. But the \"rude\r\nbarbarians of the North\" sent their sons by the thousand to die for\r\nBulgarian freedom. What about England? Go to Greece, the Netherlands,\r\nItaly, Germany, France--in all those lands I could point out places\r\nwhere the sons of Britain have died for the freedom of those peoples.\r\n[Loud applause.] France has made sacrifices for the freedom of other\r\nlands than her own. Can you name a single country in the world for the\r\nfreedom of which modern Prussia has ever sacrificed a single life?\r\n[\"No!\"] By the test of our faith, the highest standard of civilization\r\nis the readiness to sacrifice for others. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nGerman \"Civilization.\"\r\n\r\nI will not say a single word in disparagement of the German people. They\r\nare a great people, and have great qualities of head and hand\r\nand heart. I believe, in spite of recent events, that there is as great\r\na store of kindliness in the German peasant as in any peasant in the\r\nworld; but he has been drilled into a false idea of civilization. It is\r\nefficient, it is capable; but it is a hard civilization; it is a selfish\r\ncivilization; it is a material civilization. They cannot comprehend the\r\naction of Britain at the present moment; they say so. They say, \"France\r\nwe can understand; she is out for vengeance; she is out for\r\nterritory--Alsace and Lorraine.\" [Applause.] They say they can\r\nunderstand Russia; she is fighting for mastery--she wants Galicia. They\r\ncan understand you fighting for vengeance--they can understand you\r\nfighting for mastery--they can understand you fighting for greed of\r\nterritory; but they cannot understand a great empire pledging its\r\nresources, pledging its might, pledging the lives of its children,\r\npledging its very existence, to protect a little nation that seeks to\r\ndefend herself. [Applause.] God made man in His own image, high of\r\npurpose, in the region of the spirit; German civilization would recreate\r\nhim in the image of a Diesel machine--precise, accurate, powerful, but\r\nwith no room for soul to operate. [\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\n\r\nA Philosophy of Blood and Iron.\r\n\r\nHave you read the Kaiser's speeches? If you have not a copy I advise you\r\nto buy one; they will soon be out of print, and you will not have many\r\nmore of the same sort. [Laughter and applause.] They are full of the\r\nglitter and bluster of German militarism--\"mailed fist,\" and \"shining\r\narmor.\" Poor old mailed fist! Its knuckles are getting a little bruised.\r\nPoor shining armor! The shine is being knocked out of it. [Applause.]\r\nThere is the same swagger and boastfulness running through the whole of\r\nthe speeches. The extract which was given in The British Weekly this\r\nweek is a very remarkable product as an illustration of the spirit we\r\nhave to fight. It is the Kaiser's speech to his soldiers on the way to\r\nthe front:--\r\n\r\n     Remember that the German people are the chosen of God. On me, the\r\n     German Emperor, the spirit of God has descended. I am His sword,\r\n     His weapon, and His viceregent. Woe to the disobedient, and death\r\n     to cowards and unbelievers.\r\n\r\nLunacy is always distressing, but sometimes it is dangerous; and when\r\nyou get it manifested in the head of the State, and it has become the\r\npolicy of a great empire, it is about time that it should be ruthlessly\r\nput away. [Loud applause.] I do not believe he meant all these speeches;\r\nit was simply the martial straddle he had acquired. But there were men\r\naround him who meant every word of them. This was their religion.\r\nTreaties? They tangle the feet of Germany in her advance. Cut them with\r\nthe sword! Little nations? They hinder the advance of Germany. Trample\r\nthem in the mire under the German heel! The Russian Slav? He challenges\r\nthe supremacy of Germany and Europe. Hurl your legions at him and\r\nmassacre him! Britain? She is a constant menace to the predominancy of\r\nGermany in the world. Wrest the trident out of her hand! Christianity?\r\nSickly sentimentalism about sacrifice for others! Poor pap for German\r\ndigestion! We will have a new diet. We will force it upon the world. It\r\nwill be made in Germany--[Laughter and applause]--a diet of blood and\r\niron. What remains? Treaties have gone. The honor of nations has gone.\r\nLiberty has gone. What is left? Germany! Germany is left!--\"Deutschland\r\nüber Alles!\"\r\n\r\nThat is what we are fighting--[\"Hear, hear!\"]--that claim to\r\npredominancy of a material, hard civilization, a civilization which if\r\nit once rules and sways the world, liberty goes, democracy vanishes. And\r\nunless Britain and her sons come to the rescue it will be a dark day for\r\nhumanity. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nHave you followed the Prussian Junker and his doings? We are not\r\nfighting the German people. The German people are under the heel of this\r\nmilitary caste, and it will be a day of rejoicing for the German\r\npeasant, artisan and trader when the military caste is broken. You know\r\nits pretensions. They give themselves the airs of demi-gods. They walk\r\nthe pavements, and civilians and their wives are swept into the gutter;\r\nthey have no right to stand in the way of a great Prussian soldier. Men,\r\nwomen, nations--they all have to go. He thinks all he has to say is \"We\r\nare in a hurry.\" That is the answer he gave to Belgium--\"Rapidity of\r\naction is Germany's greatest asset,\" which means \"I am in a hurry; clear\r\nout of the way.\" You know the type of motorist, the terror of the roads,\r\nwith a sixty horse-power car, who thinks the roads are made for him, and\r\nknocks down anybody who impedes the action of his car by a single mile\r\nan hour. The Prussian Junker is the road-hog of Europe. [Applause.]\r\nSmall nationalities in his way are hurled to the roadside, bleeding and\r\nbroken. Women and children are crushed under the wheels of his cruel\r\ncar, and Britain is ordered out of his road. All I can say is this: If\r\nthe old British spirit is alive in British hearts, that bully will be\r\ntorn from his seat. [Loud applause.] Were he to win, it would be the\r\ngreatest catastrophe that has befallen democracy since the day of the\r\nHoly Alliance and its ascendency.\r\n\r\n\"Through Terror to Triumph.\"\r\n\r\nThey think we cannot beat them. It will not be easy. It will be a long\r\njob; it will be a terrible war; but in the end we shall march through\r\nterror to triumph. [Applause.] We shall need all our qualities--every\r\nquality that Britain and its people possess--prudence in counsel, daring\r\nin action, tenacity in purpose, courage in defeat, moderation in\r\nvictory; in all things faith! [Loud applause.]\r\n\r\nIt has pleased them to believe and to preach the belief that we are a\r\ndecadent and degenerate people. They proclaim to the world through their\r\nprofessors that we are a non-heroic nation skulking behind our mahogany\r\ncounters, while we egg on more gallant races to their destruction. This\r\nis a description given of us in Germany--\"a timorous, craven nation,\r\ntrusting to its fleet.\" I think they are beginning to find their mistake\r\nout already, [applause,] and there are half a million young men of\r\nBritain who have already registered a vow to their King that they will\r\ncross the seas and hurl that insult to British courage against its\r\nperpetrators on the battlefields of France and Germany. We want half a\r\nmillion more; and we shall get them. [Loud applause.]\r\n\r\nWales must continue doing her duty. That was a great telegram that you,\r\nmy Lord, read from Glamorgan. [\"Hear, hear!\"] I should like to see a\r\nWelsh Army in the field. [Loud applause.] I should like to see the race\r\nthat faced the Norman for hundreds of years in a struggle for freedom,\r\nthe race that helped to win Crécy, the race that fought for a generation\r\nunder Glendower against the greatest captain in Europe--I should like to\r\nsee that race give a good taste of its quality in this struggle in\r\nEurope; and they are going to do it.\r\n\r\nThe Sacrifice.\r\n\r\nI envy you young people your opportunity. They have put up the age limit\r\nfor the army, but I am sorry to say I have marched a good many years\r\neven beyond that. It is a great opportunity, an opportunity that only\r\ncomes once in many centuries to the children of men. For most\r\ngenerations sacrifice comes in drab and weariness of spirit. It comes to\r\nyou today, and it comes today to us all, in the form of the glow and\r\nthrill of a great movement for liberty, that impels millions throughout\r\nEurope to the same noble end. [Applause.] It is a great war for the\r\nemancipation of Europe from the thralldom of a military caste which has\r\nthrown its shadows upon two generations of men, and is now plunging the\r\nworld into a welter of bloodshed and death. Some have already given\r\ntheir lives. There are some who have given more than their own lives;\r\nthey have given the lives of those who are dear to them. I honor their\r\ncourage, and may God be their comfort and their strength. But their\r\nreward is at hand; those who have fallen have died consecrated deaths.\r\nThey have taken their part in the making of a new Europe--a new world. I\r\ncan see signs of its coming in the glare of the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThe people will gain more by this struggle in all lands than they\r\ncomprehend at the present moment. [\"Hear, hear!\"] It is true they will\r\nbe free of the greatest menace to their freedom. That is not\r\nall. There is something infinitely greater and more enduring which is\r\nemerging already out of this great conflict--a new patriotism, richer,\r\nnobler, and more exalted than the old. [Applause.] I see among all\r\nclasses, high and low, shedding themselves of selfishness, a new\r\nrecognition that the honor of the country does not depend merely on the\r\nmaintenance of its glory in the stricken field, but also in protecting\r\nits homes from distress. [\"Hear, hear!\"] It is bringing a new outlook\r\nfor all classes. The great flood of luxury and sloth which had submerged\r\nthe land is receding, and a new Britain is appearing. We can see for the\r\nfirst time the fundamental things that matter in life, and that have\r\nbeen obscured from our vision by the tropical growth of prosperity.\r\n[\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\n\r\n\"The Vision.\"\r\n\r\nMay I tell you in a simple parable what I think this war is doing for\r\nus? I know a valley in North Wales, between the mountains and the sea.\r\nIt is a beautiful valley, snug, comfortable, sheltered by the mountains\r\nfrom all the bitter blasts. But it is very enervating, and I remember\r\nhow the boys were in the habit of climbing the hill above the village to\r\nhave a glimpse of the great mountains in the distance, and to be\r\nstimulated and freshened by the breezes which came from the hilltops,\r\nand by the great spectacle of their grandeur. We have been living in a\r\nsheltered valley for generations. We have been too comfortable and too\r\nindulgent, many, perhaps, too selfish, and the stern hand of fate has\r\nscourged us to an elevation where we can see the great everlasting\r\nthings that matter for a nation--the great peaks we had forgotten, of\r\nhonor, duty, patriotism, and, clad in glittering white, the great\r\npinnacle of sacrifice pointing like a rugged finger to Heaven. We shall\r\ndescend into the valleys again; but as long as the men and women of this\r\ngeneration last, they will carry in their hearts the image of those\r\ngreat mountain peaks whose foundations are not shaken, though Europe\r\nrock and sway in the convulsions of a great war. [Enthusiastic and\r\ncontinued applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeachings of Gen. von Bernhardi\r\n\r\nBy Viscount (James) Bryce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon, Oct. 3.\r\n\r\nThe present war has had some unexpected consequences. It has called the\r\nattention of the world outside of Germany to some amazing doctrines\r\nproclaimed there, which strike at the root of all international morality\r\nas well as of all international law, and which threaten a return to\r\nprimitive savagery, when every tribe was wont to plunder and massacre\r\nits neighbors.\r\n\r\nThese doctrines may be found set forth in the widely circulated book of\r\nGen. von Bernhardi, entitled \"Germany and the Next War,\" published in\r\n1911, and professing to be mainly based on the teachings of the famous\r\nprofessor of history, Heinrich von Treitschke. To readers in other\r\ncountries, and I trust to most readers in Germany also, they will appear\r\nto be an outburst of militarism run mad, a product of a brain\r\nintoxicated by love of war and by superheated national self-consciousness.\r\n\r\nThey would have deserved little notice, much less refutation, but for\r\none deplorable fact, viz., that action has recently been taken by the\r\nGovernment of a great nation (though, as we hope and trust, without the\r\napproval of that nation) which is consonant with them and seems to imply\r\nbelief in their soundness.\r\n\r\nActing on Bernhardi's Doctrines.\r\n\r\nThis fact is the conduct of the German Imperial Government in the\r\nviolation of the neutrality of Belgium, which Prussia, as well as Great\r\nBritain and France, had solemnly guaranteed by treaty (made in 1839 and\r\nrenewed in 1870); in invading Belgium when she refused to allow her\r\narmies to pass, although France, the other belligerent, had explicitly\r\npromised not to enter Belgium; and in treating Belgian cities and people\r\nagainst whom she had no cause of quarrel with a harshness unprecedented\r\nin the history of modern European warfare.\r\n\r\nWhat are these doctrines? I do not for a moment attribute them to the\r\nlearned class in Germany, for whom I have profound respect, recognizing\r\ntheir immense services to science and learning; nor to the bulk of the\r\ncivil administration, a body whose capacity and uprightness are known to\r\nall the world, and least of all to the German people generally. That the\r\nlatter hold no such views appears from Bernhardi's own words, for he\r\nrepeatedly complains of and deplores the pacific tendencies of his\r\nfellow countrymen.\r\n\r\n     [_Note--See Pp. 10-14 of the English translation and note the\r\n     phrase: \"Aspirations for peace seem to poison the soul of the\r\n     German people._\"]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the fact that the action referred to, which these\r\ndoctrines seem to have prompted, and which cannot be defended except by\r\nthem, has been actually taken and has thus brought into this war Great\r\nBritain, whose interests and feelings made her desire peace, renders it\r\nproper to call attention to them and to all that they involve.\r\n\r\nI have certainly no prejudice in the matter, for I have been one of\r\nthose who for many years labored to promote good relations between the\r\nGerman and English peoples, that ought to be friendly, and that never\r\nbefore had been enemies; and I had hoped and believed till the beginning\r\nof August last that between them at least there would be no war, because\r\nBelgian neutrality would be respected.\r\n\r\nNor was it only for the sake of Great Britain and Germany that English\r\nfriends of peace sought to maintain good feeling. We had hoped, as some\r\nleading German statesmen had hoped, that a friendliness with Germany\r\nmight enable Great Britain, with the co-operation of the United States,\r\nour closest friends, to mitigate the long antagonism of Germany and of\r\nthe French, with whom we were already on good terms, and to so improve\r\ntheir relations as to secure the general peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nInto the causes which frustrated these efforts and so suddenly brought\r\non this war I will not enter. Many others have dealt with them;\r\nmoreover, the facts, at least as we in England see and believe them, and\r\nas the documents seem to prove them to be, appear not to be known to the\r\nGerman people, and the motives of the chief actors are not yet fully\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, I can confidently declare: It was neither commercial\r\nrivalry nor jealousy of German power that brought Great Britain into the\r\nfield, nor was there any hatred in the British people for the German\r\npeople, nor any wish to break their power. The leading political\r\nthinkers and historians of England had given hearty sympathy to the\r\nefforts made by the German people, from 1815 to 1866 and 1870, to attain\r\npolitical unity, and they had sympathized with the parallel efforts of\r\nthe Italians. The two nations, German and British, were of kindred race\r\nand linked by many ties. To the German people even now we feel no sort\r\nof enmity. In both countries there were doubtless some persons who\r\ndesired war and whose writings, apparently designed to provoke it, did\r\nmuch to misrepresent general national sentiment; but these persons were,\r\nas I believe, a small minority in both countries.\r\n\r\nSo far as Great Britain was concerned, it was the invasion of Belgium\r\nthat arrested all efforts to avert war and made the friends of peace\r\nthemselves join in holding that the duty of fulfilling their treaty\r\nobligations to a weak State was paramount to every other consideration.\r\n\r\nBernhardi's Praise of War.\r\n\r\nI return to the doctrines set forth by von Bernhardi and apparently\r\naccepted by the military caste to which he belongs. Briefly summed up,\r\nthey are as follows--his own words are used except when it becomes\r\nnecessary to abridge a lengthened argument:\r\n\r\n  *  War is in itself a good thing. It is a biological necessity of\r\n     the first importance. (P. 18.)\r\n\r\n  *  The inevitableness, the idealism, the blessing of war as an\r\n     indispensable and stimulating law of development must be repeatedly\r\n     emphasized. (P. 37.)\r\n\r\n  *  War is the greatest factor in the furtherance of culture and\r\n     power. Efforts to secure peace are extraordinarily detrimental as\r\n     soon as they influence politics. (P. 28.)\r\n\r\n  *  Fortunately these efforts can never attain their ultimate\r\n     objects in a world bristling with arms, where healthy egotism still\r\n     directs the policy of most countries. God will see to it, says\r\n     Treitschke, that war always recurs as a drastic medicine for the\r\n     human race. (P. 36.)\r\n\r\n  *  Efforts directed toward the abolition of war are not only\r\n     foolish, but absolutely immoral, and must be stigmatized as\r\n     unworthy of the human race. (P. 34.)\r\n\r\n  *  Courts of arbitration are pernicious delusions. The whole idea\r\n     represents a presumptuous encroachment on natural laws of\r\n     development, which can only lead to the most disastrous\r\n     consequences for humanity generally. (P. 34.)\r\n\r\n  *  The maintenance of peace never can be or may be the goal of a\r\n     policy.\r\n\r\n  *  Efforts for peace would, if they attained their goal, lead to\r\n     general degeneration, as happens everywhere in nature where the\r\n     struggle for existence is eliminated. (P. 35.)\r\n\r\n  *  Huge armaments are in themselves desirable. They are the most\r\n     necessary precondition of our national health. (P. 11.)\r\n\r\n  *  The end all and be all of a State is power, and he who is not\r\n     man enough to look this truth in the face should not meddle with\r\n     politics, (quoted from Treitschke's \"Politik\").\r\n\r\n  *  The State's highest moral duty is to increase its power. (P.\r\n     45-6.)\r\n\r\n  *  The State is justified in making conquests whenever its own\r\n     advantage seems to require additional territory. (P. 46.)\r\n\r\n  *  Self-preservation is the State's highest ideal and justifies\r\n     whatever action it may take if that action be conducive to that\r\n     end. The State is the sole judge of the morality of its own action.\r\n     It is, in fact, above morality, or, in other words, whatever is\r\n     necessary is moral. Recognized rights (i.e., treaty rights) are\r\n     never absolute rights; they are of human origin, and, therefore,\r\n     imperfect and variable. There are conditions in which they do not\r\n     correspond to the actual truth of things. In this case infringement\r\n     of the right appears morally justified. (P. 49.)\r\n\r\n  *  In fact, the State is a law unto itself. Weak nations have not\r\n     the same right to live as powerful and vigorous nations. (P. 34.)\r\n\r\n  *  Any action in favor of collective humanity outside the limits\r\n     of the State and nationality is impossible. (P. 25.)\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA Doctrine 2,200 Years Old.\r\n\r\nThese are startling propositions, though propounded as practically\r\naxiomatic. They are not new, for twenty-two centuries ago the sophist\r\nThrasymachus in Plato's \"Republic\" argued--Socrates refuting him--that\r\njustice is nothing more than the advantage of the stronger; might is\r\nright.\r\n\r\n     [_Note.--Plato laid down that the end for which the State exists is\r\n     justice._]\r\n\r\nThe most startling among them are (1) denial that there are any duties\r\nowed by the State to humanity, except that of imposing its own superior\r\ncivilization upon as large a part of humanity as possible, and (2)\r\ndenial of the duty of observing treaties which are only so much paper to\r\nmodern German writers.\r\n\r\nThe State is a much more tremendous entity than it is to Englishmen or\r\nAmericans; it is the supreme power, with a sort of mystic sanctity--a\r\npower conceived of, as it were, self-created; a force altogether\r\ndistinct from and superior to the persons who compose it. But a State\r\nis, after all, only so many individuals organized under a Government. It\r\nis no wiser, no more righteous than the human beings of whom at\r\nconsists, and whom it sets up to govern it. If it is right for persons\r\nunited as citizens into a State to rob and murder for their collective\r\nadvantage by their collective power, why should it be wicked for\r\ncitizens, as individuals, to do so? Does their moral responsibility\r\ncease when and because they act together? Most legal systems hold that\r\nthere are acts which one man may lawfully do which become unlawful if\r\ndone by a number of men conspiring together; but now it would seem that\r\nwhat would be a crime in persons as individuals, is high policy for\r\nthose persons united in a State. Has the State, then, no morality, no\r\nresponsibility? Is there no such thing as a common humanity? Are there\r\nno duties owed to it? Is there none of that \"decent respect to the\r\nopinions of mankind,\" which the framers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence recognized? No sense that even the greatest States are\r\namenable to the sentiment of the civilized world?\r\n\r\nHow Weaker States Are Affected.\r\n\r\nLet us see how these doctrines affect smaller and weaker States which\r\nhave hitherto lived in comparative security beside great powers. They\r\nwill be absolutely at the mercy of the stronger, even if protected by\r\ntreaties guaranteeing their neutrality and independence. They will not\r\nbe safe, for treaty obligations are worthless \"when they do not\r\ncorrespond to facts,\" i.e., when the strong power finds that they stand\r\nin its way its interests are paramount.\r\n\r\nIf a State hold valuable minerals, as Sweden has iron, and Belgium coal,\r\nand Rumania oil, or if it has abundance of water power, like Norway,\r\nSweden, and Switzerland; or if it holds the mouth of a navigable river,\r\nthe upper course of which belongs to another nation, a great State may\r\nconquer and annex that small State as soon as it finds that it needs\r\nminerals or water power or river mouth. It has the power, and power\r\ngives right. The interests, sentiments of patriotism, and love of\r\nindependence of the small people go for nothing. Civilization has turned\r\nback upon itself; culture is to expand itself by barbaric force;\r\nGovernments derive their authority, not from the consent of the\r\ngoverned, but from the weapons of the conqueror; law and morality\r\nbetween nations have vanished. Herodotus tells us that the Scythians\r\nworshipped as their god a naked sword; that is the deity to be installed\r\nin the place once held by the God of Christianity, the God of\r\nrighteousness and mercy.\r\n\r\nStates--mostly despotic States--have sometimes applied parts of this\r\nsystem of doctrine; but none have proclaimed it. The Roman conquerors of\r\nthe world were not a scrupulous people, but even they stopped short of\r\nthese principles; certainly they never set them up as an ideal; neither\r\ndid those magnificent Teutonic Emperors of the Middle Ages, whose fame\r\nGen. von Bernhardi is fond of recalling. They did not enter Italy as\r\nconquerors, claiming her by right of the strongest; they came on the\r\nfaith of a legal title which, however fantastic it may seem to us today,\r\nthe Italians themselves, and, indeed, the whole of Latin Christendom,\r\nadmitted. Dante, the greatest and most patriotic of Italians, welcomed\r\nthe Emperor Henry VII. into Italy, and wrote a famous book to prove his\r\nclaims, vindicating them on the ground that he, as heir of Rome, stood\r\nfor law and right and peace. The noblest title which these Emperors\r\nchose to bear was that of Imperator Pacificus.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, when men were always fighting, they appreciated the\r\nblessings of war much less than does Gen. von Bernhardi, and they valued\r\npeace, not war, as a means to civilization and culture. They had not\r\nlearned in the school of Treitschke that peace means decadence and war\r\nis the true civilizing influence.\r\n\r\nGreat Achievements of Small States.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines above stated are, as I have tried to point out, well\r\ncalculated to alarm small States which prize their liberty and their\r\nindividuality, and have been thriving under the safeguard of treaties;\r\nbut there are other considerations affecting those States which ought to\r\nappeal to men in all countries, to strong nations as well as to weak\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe small States whose absorption is now threatened have been a potent\r\nand useful--perhaps the most potent and useful--factor in the advance of\r\ncivilization. It is in them and by them that most of what is most\r\nprecious in religion, in philosophy, in literature, in science, and in\r\nart has been produced.\r\n\r\nThe first great thoughts that brought man into true relation with God\r\ncame from a tiny people inhabiting a country smaller than Denmark. The\r\nreligions of mighty Babylon and populous Egypt have vanished; the\r\nreligion of Israel remains in its earlier as well as in that later form\r\nwhich has overspread the world.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were a small people, not united in one great State, but\r\nscattered over coasts and among hills in petty city communities, each\r\nwith its own life. Slender in numbers, but eager, versatile, and\r\nintense, they gave us the richest, most varied, and most stimulating of\r\nall literatures.\r\n\r\nWhen poetry and art reappeared after the long night of the Dark Ages,\r\ntheir most splendid blossoms flowered in the small republics of Italy.\r\n\r\nIn modern Europe what do we not owe to little Switzerland, lighting the\r\ntorch of freedom 600 years ago and keeping it alight through all the\r\ncenturies when despotic monarchies held the rest of the European\r\nContinent? And what to free Holland, with her great men of learning and\r\nher painters surpassing those of all other countries save Italy?\r\n\r\nSo the small Scandinavian nations have given to the world famous men of\r\nscience, from Linnaeus downward; poets like Tegnor and Björnson;\r\nscholars like Madvig; dauntless explorers like Fridtjof Nansen.\r\n\r\nEngland had in the age of Shakespeare, Bacon, and Milton a population\r\nlittle larger than that of Bulgaria today. The United States in the days\r\nof Washington and Franklin and Jefferson and Hamilton and Marshall\r\ncounted fewer inhabitants than Denmark or Greece. In the most brilliant\r\ngenerations of German literature and thought, the age of Kant and\r\nLessing and Goethe, of Hegel and Schiller and Fichte, there was no real\r\nGerman State at all, but a congeries of principalities and free\r\ncities--independent centres of intellectual life in which letters and\r\nscience produced a richer crop than the two succeeding generations have\r\nraised, just as Great Britain also, with eight times the population of\r\nthe year 1600, has had no more Shakespeares or Miltons.\r\n\r\nCulture Decayed in Imperial Rome.\r\n\r\nNo fiction is more palpably contradicted by history than that relied on\r\nby the school to which von Bernhardi belongs--that culture, literary,\r\nscientific, and artistic, flourishes best in great military States. The\r\ndecay of art and literature in the Roman world began just when Rome's\r\nmilitary power had made that world one great and ordered State. The\r\nopposite view would be much nearer the truth, though one must admit that\r\nno general theory regarding the relations of art and letters to\r\nGovernments and political conditions has ever yet been proved to be\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n     [_Note--Gen. von Bernhardi's knowledge of current history may be\r\n     estimated by the fact that he assumes_ (1) _that trade rivalry\r\n     makes war probable between Great Britain and the United States;_\r\n     (2) _that he believes that the Indian princes and peoples are\r\n     likely to revolt against Great Britain should she be involved in\r\n     war, and_ (3) _that he expects her self-governing colonies to take\r\n     such an opportunity of severing their connection with her._]\r\n\r\nThe world is already too uniform and is becoming more uniform every day.\r\nA few leading languages, a few forms of civilization, a few types of\r\ncharacter, are spreading out from the seven or eight greatest States and\r\nextinguishing weaker languages, forms, and types. Although great States\r\nare stronger and more populous, their peoples are not necessarily more\r\ngifted, and the extinction of the minor languages and types would be a\r\nmisfortune for the world's future development.\r\n\r\nWe may not be able to arrest the forces which seem to be making for that\r\nextinction, but we certainly ought not strengthen them. Rather we ought\r\nto maintain and defend the smaller States and to favor the rise and\r\ngrowth of new peoples. Not merely because they were delivered from the\r\ntyranny of Sultans like Abdul Hamid did the intellect of Europe welcome\r\nthe successively won liberations of Greece, Servia, Bulgaria, and\r\nMontenegro; it was also in the hope that those countries would in time\r\ndevelop out of their present crude conditions new types of culture, new\r\ncentres of productive intellectual life.\r\n\r\nGen. von Bernhardi invokes history as the ultimate court of appeal. He\r\nappeals to Caesar; to Caesar let him go. \"Die Weltgeschichte ist das\r\nWeltgericht\", (\"World history is world tribunal.\") History declares that\r\nno nation, however great, is entitled to try to impose its type of\r\ncivilization on others. No race, not even the Teutonic or Anglo-Saxon,\r\nis entitled to claim the leadership of humanity. Each people has in its\r\ntime contributed something that was distinctively its own, and the world\r\nis far richer thereby than if any one race, however gifted, had\r\nestablished its permanent ascendency.\r\n\r\nWe of the Anglo-Saxon race do not claim for ourselves, any more than we\r\nadmit in others, any right to dominate by force or to impose our own\r\ntype of civilization on less powerful races. Perhaps we have not that\r\nassured conviction of its superiority which the school of von Bernhardi\r\nexpressed for the Teutons of North Germany. We know how much we owe,\r\neven within our own islands, to the Celtic race; and, though we must\r\nadmit that peoples of Anglo-Saxon stock have, like others, made some\r\nmistakes and sometimes abused their strength, let it be remembered what\r\nhave been the latest acts they have done abroad.\r\n\r\nPraises American Altruism.\r\n\r\nThe United States have twice withdrawn their troops from Cuba, which\r\nthey could easily have retained; they have resisted all temptations to\r\nannex any part of the territories of Mexico, in which the lives and\r\nproperty of their citizens were for three years in constant danger. So\r\nGreat Britain also six years ago restored the amplest self-government to\r\ntwo South African republics, having already agreed to the maintenance on\r\nequal terms of the Dutch language; and the citizens of those republics,\r\nwhich were in arms against her thirteen years ago, have now\r\nspontaneously come forward to support her by arms under the gallant\r\nleader who then commanded the Boers; and I may add that one reason why\r\nthe Princes of India have rallied so promptly and heartily to Great\r\nBritain in this war is because for many years past we have avoided\r\nannexing the territories of those Princes, allowing them to adopt heirs\r\nwhen the successors of their own families failed, and leaving to them as\r\nmuch as possible of the ordinary functions of government.\r\n\r\nService the Test of Greatness.\r\n\r\nIt is only vulgar minds that mistake bigness for greatness; for\r\ngreatness is of the soul, not of the body. In the judgment which history\r\nwill hereafter pass upon the forty centuries of recorded progress toward\r\ncivilization that now lie behind us, what are the tests it will apply to\r\ndetermine the true greatness of a people? Not population, not territory,\r\nnot wealth, not military power; rather will history ask what examples of\r\nlofty character and unselfish devotion to honor and duty has a people\r\ngiven? What has it done to increase the volume of knowledge? What\r\nthoughts and what ideals of permanent value and unexhausted fertility\r\nhas it bequeathed to mankind? What works has it produced in poetry,\r\nmusic, and other arts to be an unfailing source of enjoyment to\r\nposterity? The small peoples need not fear the application of such\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nThe world advances, not, as the Bernhardi school supposes, only or even\r\nmainly by fighting; it advances mainly by thinking and by the process of\r\nreciprocal teaching and learning; by the continuous and unconscious\r\nco-operation of all its strongest and finest minds. Each race--Hellenic,\r\nItalic, Celtic, Teutonic, Iberian, Slavonic--has something to give, each\r\nsomething to learn; and when their blood is blended the mixed stock may\r\ncombine gifts of both. Most progressive races have been those who\r\ncombined willingness to learn with strength, which enabled them to\r\nreceive without loss to their own quality, retaining their primal vigor,\r\nbut entering into the labors of others, as the Teutons who settled\r\nwithin the dominions of Rome profited by the lessons of the old\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nLet me disclaim once more before I close, any intention to attribute to\r\nthe German people the principles set forth by the school of Treitschke\r\nand Bernhardi--the school which teaches hatred of peace and\r\narbitration, disregard of treaty obligations, scorn for weaker peoples.\r\nWe in England would feel even deeper sadness than weighs upon us now if\r\nwe could suppose that such principles had been embraced by the nation\r\nwhose thinkers have done so much for human progress and who have\r\nproduced so many shining examples of Christian saintliness; but when\r\nthose principles have been ostentatiously proclaimed, when a peaceful\r\nneutral country which the other belligerent had solemnly and repeatedly\r\nundertaken to respect has been invaded and treated as Belgium has been\r\ntreated, and when attempts are made to justify these deeds as incidental\r\nto a campaign for civilization and culture, it becomes necessary to\r\npoint out how untrue and how pernicious such principles are.\r\n\r\nMost Wars Needless and Unjust.\r\n\r\nWhat are the teachings of history to which Gen. Bernhardi is fond of\r\nappealing? That war has been the constant handmaid of tyranny and the\r\nsource of more than half the miseries of man; that, although some wars\r\nhave been necessary and have given occasion for a display of splendid\r\nheroism--wars of defense against aggression or to succor the\r\noppressed--most wars have been needless or unjust; that the mark of an\r\nadvancing civilization has been the substitution of friendship for\r\nhatred and of peaceful for warlike ideals; that small peoples have done\r\nand can do as much for the common good of humanity as large peoples;\r\nthat treaties must be observed, (for what are they but records of\r\nnational faith, solemnly pledged, and what could bring mankind more\r\nsurely and swiftly back to that reign of violence and terror from which\r\nit has been slowly rising for the last ten centuries than the\r\ndestruction of trust in the plighted faith of nations?)\r\n\r\nNo event has brought out that essential unity which now exists in the\r\nworld so forcibly as this war has done, for no event has ever so\r\naffected every part of the world. Four continents are involved, the\r\nwhole of the Old World, and the New World suffers grievously in its\r\ntrade, industry, and finances. Thus the whole world is interested in\r\npreventing the recurrence of such a calamity and there is a general\r\nfeeling throughout the world that the causes which have brought it upon\r\nus must be removed.\r\n\r\nWe are told that armaments must be reduced; that the baleful spirit of\r\nmilitarism must be quenched; that peoples must everywhere be admitted to\r\na fuller share in the control of foreign policy; that efforts must be\r\nmade to establish a sort of league of concord--some system of\r\ninternational relations and reciprocal peace alliances by which weaker\r\nnations may be protected and under which differences between nations may\r\nbe adjusted by courts of arbitration and conciliation of wider scope\r\nthan those that now exist.\r\n\r\nAll these things are desirable, but no scheme for preventing future wars\r\nwill have any chance of success unless it rests upon the assurance that\r\nthe States which enter into it will loyally and steadfastly abide by it,\r\nand that each and all of them will join in coercing by their\r\noverwhelming united strength any State which may disregard obligations\r\nit has undertaken. The faith of treaties is the only solid foundation on\r\nwhich the temple of peace can be built up.\r\n\r\nJAMES BRYCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEntrance of France Into War\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy President Poincare and Premier Viviani.\r\n\r\n     Proclamation Issued to the People of France by President Poincare,\r\n     Paris, Aug. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n     For some days the condition of Europe has become considerably more\r\n     serious in spite of the efforts of diplomacy. The horizon has\r\n     become darkened.\r\n\r\n     At this hour most of the nations have mobilized their forces.\r\n\r\n     Some countries, even though protected by neutrality, have thought\r\n     it right to take this step as a precaution.\r\n\r\n     Some powers, whose constitutional and military laws do not resemble\r\n     our own, have without issuing a decree of mobilization begun and\r\n     continued preparations which are in reality equivalent to\r\n     mobilization and which are nothing more or less than an\r\n     anticipation of it _(qui n'en sont que l'exécution anticipée_).\r\n\r\n     France, who has always declared her pacific intentions, and who has\r\n     at the darkest hours (_dans des heures tragiques_) given to Europe\r\n     counsels of moderation and a living example of prudence\r\n     (_sagesse_), who has multiplied her efforts for the maintenance of\r\n     the world's peace, has herself prepared for all eventualties and\r\n     has taken from this moment the first indispensable measures for the\r\n     safety of her territory.\r\n\r\n     But our legislation does not allow us to complete these\r\n     preparations without a decree of mobilization.\r\n\r\n     Careful of its responsibility and realizing that it would be\r\n     failing in a sacred task to leave things as they were, the\r\n     Government has issued the decree which the situation demands.\r\n\r\n     Mobilization is not war. In the present circumstances it appears,\r\n     on the contrary, to be the best means of assuring peace with honor.\r\n\r\n     Strong in its ardent desire to arrive at a peaceful solution of the\r\n     crisis the Government, protected by such precautions as are\r\n     necessary, will continue its diplomatic efforts, and it still hopes\r\n     to succeed.\r\n\r\n     It relies upon the calm of this noble nation not to give rein to\r\n     emotions which are not justified. It relies upon the patriotism of\r\n     all Frenchmen, and it knows that there is not one who is not ready\r\n     to do his duty.\r\n\r\n     At this moment parties no longer exist; there remains only France,\r\n     the eternal, the pacific, the resolute. There remains only the\r\n     fatherland of right and of justice, entirely united in calm\r\n     vigilance and dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RENE VIVIANI,\r\nFrench Premier.\r\n(_Photograph from Bain News Service._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUTRALIZED STATE RESPECTED.\r\n\r\nTelegram from M. Viviani, French Premier and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, to the Ministry in Luxembourg, Published Aug. 3.\r\n\r\nPlease declare to the President of the Council that, in accordance with\r\nthe Treaty of London of 1867, the Government of the Republic intended to\r\nrespect the neutrality of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, as it has shown\r\nby its attitude. The violation of this neutrality by Germany is,\r\nhowever, of a nature which compels France to take henceforth the\r\nmeasures in this respect required by her defense and interests.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister of Luxembourg has protested to the German Government,\r\nand has brought this protest to the notice of the German Embassy in\r\nParis, stating the following facts:\r\n\r\n     On Sunday, Aug. 2, early in the morning, the Germans entered\r\n     Luxembourg territory by the bridges of Wasserbourg(?) and Remleh,\r\n     proceeding toward the south of the country and Luxembourg, its\r\n     capital. They have also brought toward this point armored trains,\r\n     with troops and munitions of war. Further, the special French\r\n     Commissioner at Petitcroix has announced to the Sûreté Générale\r\n     that the Germans have just opened fire on the frontier station of\r\n     Delle-Petitcroix. Two German cavalry officers have just been killed\r\n     at Roncray and Boxson, ten kilometers on our side of the frontier.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATION IN ARMS.\r\n\r\n     Address to the French Parliament by President Poincare, Aug. 4.\r\n\r\n     Our nation is in arms and trembling with eagerness to defend the\r\n     land of our fathers.\r\n\r\n     France is faithfully supported by her ally, Russia.

Jusserand, French Ambassador to the\r\nUnited States, \"the chief document printed up to now [Nov. 1] in\r\nwhich the French situation, with reference to the present war, has been\r\nexpounded._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the German Ambassador left Paris yesterday, after having\r\nnotified us of the existence of a state of war.\r\n\r\nThe Government is in duty bound to give Parliament a truthful recital of\r\nthe events which, within less than ten days, have brought about war in\r\nEurope and obliged France, peaceful and strong, to defend her frontier\r\nagainst an attack the premeditated suddenness of which emphasizes its\r\nodious injustice.\r\n\r\nThis attack, entirely inexcusable and begun before any declaration of\r\nwar notified us of it, is the last act in a plan whose origin and aim I\r\nintend to lay bare before our republic and before civilized public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nAfter the abominable crime which cost the lives of the heir to the\r\nAustro-Hungarian throne and of the Duchess of Hohenberg, trouble arose\r\nbetween the Governments of Vienna and Belgrade.\r\n\r\nMost of the great powers were not informed of this except\r\nsemi-officially up to Friday, the 24th day of July, on which day the\r\nAmbassadors of Austria-Hungary sent them a circular note, which has been\r\npublished in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe object of this note was to explain and justify an ultimatum sent the\r\nevening before to Servia, through the Austrian Minister at Belgrade.\r\n\r\nThis ultimatum asserted that a number of Servian subjects and\r\nassociations were implicated in the crime of Serajevo, and implied that\r\nmembers of the Servian Government themselves were not without\r\ncomplicity in it. It demanded a reply from Servia, giving Saturday,\r\nJuly 25, at 6 in the evening, as the time limit.\r\n\r\nAustria Amazes Allies.\r\n\r\nThe reparations demanded, or, at least, some among them, unquestionably\r\nwere derogatory to the rights of a sovereign nation. But in spite of\r\ntheir extreme character Servia, on July 25, declared that she submitted\r\nto them almost without a reservation of any sort.\r\n\r\nThe advice transmitted by France, Russia, and Great Britain from the\r\nvery first to Belgrade was not without its effect in bringing about this\r\nsubmission, which was a success for Austria-Hungary and likewise a\r\nguarantee toward the maintenance of European peace.\r\n\r\nThis advice was all the more valuable in view of the fact that\r\nAustria-Hungary's demands had been inadequately foreshadowed to the\r\nGovernments of the Triple Entente, to whom, during the three preceding\r\nweeks, the Austro-Hungarian Government had repeatedly given assurances\r\nthat its demands would be extremely moderate.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, with justified astonishment that the Cabinets of\r\nParis, St. Petersburg, and London heard, on July 26, that the Austrian\r\nMinister at Belgrade, after an examination lasting only a few minutes,\r\nhad declared the Servian reply unacceptable and broken off diplomatic\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nGermany the Stumbling Block.\r\n\r\nThis astonishment was rendered greater by the fact that, on Friday, the\r\n21st, the German Ambassador had visited the French Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs for the purpose of reading to him a note to the effect that the\r\nAustro-Servian dispute should be localized and not made the subject of\r\nintervention by the great powers, and that, unless such were the case,\r\n\"incalculable consequences\" were to be feared. Like action was taken on\r\nSaturday, the 25th, at London and St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary, gentlemen, to point out to you the difference between\r\nthe menacing methods employed by the German Ambassador at Paris and the\r\nconciliatory sentiments of which the powers of the Triple Entente had\r\njust given proof by their advice to Servia to submit?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, passing over the abnormal character of the German action,\r\nwe, in conjunction with our allies and friends, immediately instituted\r\nmeasures of conciliation and invited Germany to take part in them.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first we were chagrined to find that our acts and efforts\r\nfound no echo at Berlin.\r\n\r\nNot only did Germany seem unwilling to give Austria-Hungary the amicable\r\nadvice which her situation authorized her to give, but, from that very\r\ntime and even more in the ensuing days, she seemed to place herself\r\nbetween the Vienna Cabinet and the propositions of a compromise\r\nemanating from the other powers.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Servia. This\r\ndeclaration of war, complicating forty-eight hours after the situation\r\nbrought about by the rupture of diplomatic relations, lent color to the\r\nassumption that there had been a premeditated plan to make war, a\r\nsystematic programme for the subjugation of Servia.\r\n\r\nThus not only the independence of a brave nation became involved, but\r\nalso the balance of power in the Balkans, set forth in the Treaty of\r\nBucharest of 1913, and sanctioned by the moral adhesion of all the great\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, at the suggestion of the British Government, always\r\ninterested in the most steadfast manner in the maintenance of European\r\npeace, the negotiations continued, or, to be more exact, the powers\r\nconstituting the Triple Entente tried to continue them.\r\n\r\nTo their common desire was due the proposition for quadruple action,\r\nviz., by England, France, Germany, and Italy, with the object of\r\nassuring to Austria all legitimate reparation and bringing about an\r\nequitable arrangement of the difficulty. On Wednesday, the 29th, the\r\nRussian Government, noting the persistent blocking of these attempts,\r\nAustria's mobilization and her declaration of war, and fearing that\r\nServia would be crushed by military force, decided, as a preventive\r\nmeasure, to mobilize her troops in four military zones, namely, only\r\nthose stationed along the Austro-Hungarian frontier.\r\n\r\nIn doing this it took care to notify the German Government that this\r\nstep, limited in character and not constituting an offensive move\r\nagainst Austria, was not in any way directed against Germany.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation with the Russian Ambassador at Berlin the German\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs showed no objection to\r\nrecognizing this.\r\n\r\nGermany Becomes Warlike.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, all the attempts of Great Britain, backed by Russia\r\nand with the support of France, for establishing contact between Austria\r\nand Servia under the moral auspices of Europe, was met in Berlin by a\r\npremeditated negative attitude, the existence of which is absolutely\r\nproved by the diplomatic communications.\r\n\r\nThis made a troublous state of affairs which pointed to the existence at\r\nBerlin of certain mental reservations. A few hours later these\r\nsuppositions and fears were destined to be changed into certainties.\r\n\r\nFor the negative attitude of Germany was transformed thirty-six hours\r\nlater into truly alarming initiative. On July 31, Germany, by declaring\r\na state of war, cut off the communication between herself and the rest\r\nof Europe, and gave herself perfect freedom to make military\r\npreparations against France, in complete secrecy, which nothing, as you\r\nhave seen, could justify.\r\n\r\nDuring several days and under conditions difficult to explain Germany\r\nhad been preparing to change her army from a peace to a war footing.\r\n\r\nFrom July 25 in the morning, that is even before the expiration of the\r\ntime limit set Servia by Austria, she had brought to their full strength\r\nthe garrisons in Alsace-Lorraine. On the same day she had placed the\r\nworks close to the frontier in a state of effective armament. On the\r\n26th she had prescribed for the railroads the preparatory measures for\r\nconcentration. On the 27th she had made requisitions and placed her\r\ncovering troops in position. On the 28th the summoning of individual\r\nreservists began, including those distant from the frontier.\r\n\r\nCould we be left in doubt as to Germany's intentions after her taking\r\nall these measures with relentless thoroughness?\r\n\r\nFrance Forced to Act.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the situation when, on July 31, in the evening, the\r\nGerman Government, which had not taken any positive part since the 24th\r\nin the conciliatory efforts of the Triple Entente, sent to the Russian\r\nGovernment an ultimatum alleging that Russia had ordered the general\r\nmobilization of her armies, and demanding the cessation of this\r\nmobilization within twelve hours.\r\n\r\nThis demand, all the more offensive as to form when it is borne in mind\r\nthat a few hours earlier Emperor Nicholas, actuated by a spontaneous\r\nfeeling of confidence, had asked the German Emperor to mediate, was made\r\nat the moment when, at the request of England and with the knowledge of\r\nGermany, the Russian Government was accepting a proposition of a kind\r\ncalculated to bring about an amicable arrangement of the Austro-Servian\r\nconflict and of the Austro-Russian difficulties by means of the\r\nsimultaneous cessation of military operations and preparations.\r\n\r\nOn the same day there were added to this unfriendly step toward Russia\r\nacts of distinct hostility toward France; rupture of communications by\r\nroads, railways, telegraph, and telephone, seizure of French locomotives\r\nupon arrival at the frontier, placing of rapid-fire guns in the middle\r\nof railway lines which had been torn up, and concentration of troops on\r\nour frontier.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment it was impossible for us to believe any longer in the\r\nsincerity of the pacific protestations which the representative of\r\nGermany continued to lavish upon us.\r\n\r\nWe were aware that, under the shelter of the declaration of a state of\r\nwar which Germany had made, she was mobilizing.\r\n\r\nWe learned that six classes of reservists had been summoned and that\r\nconcentration of army corps was under way, even of those corps stationed\r\na long distance from the frontier.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as these events developed, the Government, alert and\r\nvigilant, took day by day, even hour by hour, the precautionary measures\r\nmade necessary by the situation; general mobilization of our land and\r\nsea forces was ordered.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, at 7:30, Germany, ignoring the acceptance by the St.\r\nPetersburg Cabinet of the English proposition to which I have already\r\nreferred, declared war upon Russia.\r\n\r\nDenies Hostile Acts by French.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Sunday, Aug. 2, despite the extreme moderation of France\r\nand the pacific statements of the German Ambassador in Paris, and\r\nscorning the rules of international law, German troops crossed our\r\nfrontier at three different points.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in violation of the Treaty of 1867 guaranteeing the\r\nneutrality of Luxemburg, of which Prussia was a signatory, they invaded\r\nthe territory of the Grand Duchy, thus evoking a protest from the\r\nLuxemburg Government.\r\n\r\nFinally, even the neutrality of Belgium was menaced. On the evening of\r\nAug. 2 the German Minister handed to the Belgian Government an ultimatum\r\ndemanding that military operations against France be facilitated by\r\nBelgium under the lying pretext that Belgian neutrality was threatened\r\nby us.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian Government refused, announcing that it had resolved to\r\ndefend energetically its neutrality respected by France and guaranteed\r\nby treaties, especially by the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nSince then, gentlemen, acts of aggression have been repeated,\r\nmultiplied, and accentuated. Our frontier has been crossed at more than\r\nfifteen places. Rifle shots have been fired at our soldiers and customs\r\nofficials. There have been killed and wounded. Yesterday a German\r\nmilitary aviator dropped three bombs on Lunéville.\r\n\r\nThe German Ambassador, to whom, as well as to the other great powers, we\r\ncommunicated these acts did not deny them, nor even express regret. On\r\nthe contrary, he came to me yesterday evening to ask for his passport\r\nand notify us of the existence of a state of war, alleging without\r\njustification hostile acts committed by French aviators on German\r\nterritory in the Eiffel region, and even on the railway from Karlsruhe\r\nto Nuremberg. Here is the letter on this subject which he handed to me:\r\n\r\n     Mr. President: German civil and military authorities have taken\r\n     note of a certain number of acts of a hostile character committed\r\n     on German territory by French military aviators. Several of the\r\n     latter have clearly violated the neutrality of Belgium by flying\r\n     over the territory of that nation. One tried to destroy buildings\r\n     near Wesel, others were seen over the Eiffel region, another threw\r\n     bombs on the railway line between Karlsruhe and Nuremberg.\r\n\r\n     I have been charged with informing your Excellency, and now have\r\n     the honor of doing so, that in view of these acts of aggression the\r\n     German Empire now considers itself in a state of war with France as\r\n     a result of the acts of the latter power.\r\n\r\n     I have at the same time the honor of bringing to your Excellency's\r\n     knowledge that the German authorities will detain French merchant\r\n     vessels in German ports, but will release them if within\r\n     forty-eight hours complete reciprocity is assured.\r\n\r\n     My diplomatic mission having terminated, all that remains for me to\r\n     do is to request your Excellency to provide me with my passports\r\n     and take whatever measures your Excellency may deem necessary to\r\n     effect my return to Germany with the personnel of the embassy and\r\n     of the Bavarian Legation and the Consulate General of Germany at\r\n     Paris.\r\n\r\n     With sentiments of my highest consideration.\r\n\r\n     SCHOEN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it necessary, gentlemen, that I should call attention to the\r\nabsurdity of the pretexts brought forward as grievances? Never at any\r\ntime has any French aviator gone into Belgium; no French aviator has\r\ncommitted an act of hostility either in Bavaria or any other part of\r\nGermany. European public opinion has already done justice to these\r\nmiserable inventions.\r\n\r\nWe immediately took all needed steps against this attack, which violates\r\nall laws of equity and rules of public law. The carrying out of these is\r\nprogressing with thorough system and absolute calm.\r\n\r\nThe mobilization of the Russian Army is also being continued with\r\nremarkable energy and boundless enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian Army, mobilized up to 250,000 men, is preparing with\r\nmagnificent spirit to defend the neutrality and independence of its\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe English fleet is entirely mobilized, and the order has been given\r\nfor the mobilization of the land forces.\r\n\r\nSince 1912 there have been consultations between the English and French\r\nGeneral Staffs. These had resulted in an exchange of letters between Sir\r\nEdward Grey and M. Paul Cambon. The Secretary of State made these known\r\nyesterday in the House of Commons, and, in accordance with the wishes of\r\nthe British Government, I shall have the honor of reading these two\r\ndocuments to this Parliament:\r\n\r\n\r\n     London, Foreign Office, Nov. 22, 1912.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Ambassador:\r\n\r\n     From time to time in recent years the French and British naval and\r\n     military experts have consulted together. It has always been\r\n     understood that such consultation does not restrict the freedom of\r\n     either Government to decide at any future time whether or not to\r\n     assist the other by armed force. We have agreed that consultation\r\n     between experts is not and ought not to be regarded as an\r\n     engagement that commits either Government to action in a\r\n     contingency that has not arisen and may never arise. The\r\n     disposition, for instance, of the French and British fleets\r\n     respectively at the present moment is not based upon an engagement\r\n     to co-operate in war.\r\n\r\n     You have, however, pointed out that, if either Government had grave\r\n     reason to expect an unprovoked attack by a third power, it might\r\n     become essential to know whether it could in that event depend upon\r\n     the armed assistance of the other.\r\n\r\n     I agree that, if either Government had grave reason to expect an\r\n     unprovoked attack by a third power, or something that threatened\r\n     the general peace, it should immediately discuss with the other\r\n     whether both Governments should act together to prevent aggression\r\n     and to preserve peace, and, if so, what measures they would be\r\n     prepared to take in common. If these measures involved action, the\r\n     plans of the General Staffs would at once be taken into\r\n     consideration, and the Governments would then decide what effect\r\n     should be given to them. Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n     E. GREY.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nM. PAUL CAMBON TO SIR EDWARD GREY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     London, Nov. 23, 1912.\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir Edward: You reminded me in your letter of yesterday, 22d\r\n     November, that during the last few years the military and naval\r\n     authorities of France and Great Britain had consulted with each\r\n     other from time to time; that it had always been understood that\r\n     these consultations should not restrict the liberty of either\r\n     Government to decide in the future whether they should lend each\r\n     other the support of their armed forces; that, on either side,\r\n     these consultations between experts were not and should not be\r\n     considered as engagements binding our Governments to take action in\r\n     certain eventualities; that, however, I had remarked to you that,\r\n     if one or other of the two Governments had grave reasons to fear an\r\n     unprovoked attack on the part of a third power, it would become\r\n     essential to know whether it could count on the armed support of\r\n     the other.\r\n\r\n     Your letter answers that point, and I am authorized to state that,\r\n     in the event of one of our two Governments having grave reasons to\r\n     fear either an attack from a third power, or some event threatening\r\n     the general peace, that Government would immediately examine with\r\n     the other the question whether both Governments should act together\r\n     in order to prevent aggression or preserve peace. If so, the two\r\n     Governments would deliberate as to the measures which they would be\r\n     prepared to take in common. If those measures involved action the\r\n     two Governments would take into immediate consideration the plans\r\n     of their General Staffs and would then decide as to the effect to\r\n     be given to those plans.\r\n\r\n     Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n     PAUL CAMBON.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment's Acts Beyond Reproach.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs spoke\r\nof France, amid the applause of the members, in lofty and impassioned\r\nwords, which have already elicited genuine response from all French\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nIn the name of the Government of the Republic I wish, from this rostrum,\r\nto thank the British Government for the cordiality of its words, and the\r\nFrench Parliament will join me in this.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made this declaration\r\nparticularly:\r\n\r\nThat in case the German fleet entered the Channel or steamed northward\r\nin the North Sea to go around the British Isles with the purpose of\r\nattacking the French Coast or the French Navy, and to harass the French\r\nmerchant marine, the English fleet would interfere by giving the French\r\nfleet its entire protection, in such manner that from that moment\r\nEngland and Germany would be in a state of war.\r\n\r\nThus, from the present moment, the English fleet is guarding our\r\nnorthern and western coast against German aggression.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, those are the facts. I think that, taken as a close-knit\r\nwhole, they are sufficient to justify the acts of the Government of the\r\nRepublic. Nevertheless, I wish to conclude by giving the true meaning of\r\nthis unprecedented aggression of which France is the victim.\r\n\r\nThe victors of 1870, as you know, have felt at various times the desire\r\nof renewing the blows which they had dealt us. In 1875 the war for\r\nfinishing vanquished France was prevented only by the intervention of\r\nthe two powers destined to be united to us later by the ties of alliance\r\nand friendship--by the intervention of Russia and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nSince then the French Republic, by the restoration of its strength and\r\nthe making of diplomatic agreements, invariably lived up to, has\r\nsucceeded in freeing itself from the yoke which Bismarck had been able\r\nto impose upon Europe even in days of peace.\r\n\r\nIt re-established the European balance of power, that guarantee of the\r\nliberty and dignity of each nation.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I do not know whether I am deceiving myself, but it seems to\r\nme that it is this work of pacific reparation, liberation, and dignity,\r\ndefinitely sealed in 1904 and 1907 with the support of King Edward VII.\r\nof England and of the royal Government, which the German Empire desires\r\nto destroy today by an audacious piece of violence.\r\n\r\nGermany can reproach us with nothing.\r\n\r\nWe have made an unprecedented sacrifice to peace by bearing in silence\r\nfor half a century the wound inflicted by Germany.\r\n\r\nWe have acquiesced in other sacrifices in all the disputes which, since\r\n1904, imperial diplomacy has systematically provoked either in Morocco\r\nor elsewhere, in 1905 as well as in 1906, in 1908 as well as in 1911.\r\n\r\nItaly's Attitude.\r\n\r\nRussia also has given proof of great moderation, both in the events of\r\n1908 and the present crisis. She acted with the same moderation--and the\r\nTriple Entente with her--when, in the Eastern crisis of 1912, Austria\r\nand Germany formulated against Servia and Greece demands amenable to\r\ndiscussion, as the result proved.\r\n\r\nUseless sacrifices, sterile compromises, futile efforts--today, while\r\nactually engaged in efforts at conciliation, we and our allies are\r\nsuddenly attacked.\r\n\r\nNobody can believe in good faith that we are the aggressors; in vain the\r\nsacred principles of law and liberty, which rule nations as well as\r\nindividuals, are assailed. Italy, with the clear conscience of Latin\r\ngenius, has informed us that she will remain neutral.\r\n\r\nThis decision has aroused the sincerest joy throughout France. I made\r\nmyself the spokesman of this to the Italian Chargé d'Affaires, telling\r\nhim how delighted I was that the two Latin sisters, who have the same\r\norigin and ideals, and a glorious past in common, are not opposed to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nWhat is being attacked, I repeat, gentlemen, is that independence,\r\ndignity, and security which the Triple Entente has restored to the\r\nbalance of power in the service of peace.\r\n\r\nWhat is being attacked are the liberties of Europe, whose defenders\r\nFrance, her allies, and her friends are proud to be.\r\n\r\nWe shall defend these liberties, for it is they which are in jeopardy;\r\nall else is merely a pretext.\r\n\r\nFrance, unjustly provoked, did not desire war. She has done everything\r\nto prevent it. But since it is forced upon her, she will defend herself\r\nagainst Germany, and against every power which has not as yet announced\r\nits position but which should later on take sides with Germany in the\r\nwar between the two.\r\n\r\nA free and strong nation, strengthened by venerable ideals, firmly\r\nunited in defense of its existence, a democracy which has known how to\r\ndiscipline its military acts, and which did not fear last year to impose\r\nupon itself additional military burdens to offset those of neighboring\r\ncountries, an armed nation fighting for its own life and for the\r\nindependence of Europe--that is the spectacle which we are proud to show\r\nthe witnesses of this formidable struggle, which has been in preparation\r\nfor some days amid methodical quiet.\r\n\r\nWe are without reproach. We shall be without fear.\r\n\r\nFrance has often proved, under less favorable conditions, that she is\r\nthe most formidable adversary when she fights, as she now does, for\r\nliberty and right.\r\n\r\nIn placing our acts before you, gentlemen, who are our judges, we have\r\nthe comfort of a clear conscience and the certainty of having done our\r\nduty to help us bear the weight of our heavy responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE MARNE BATTLE.\r\n\r\nProclamation by the Government Announcing Transfer of Capital to\r\nBordeaux, Sept. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n     People of France: For several weeks relentless battles have engaged\r\n     our heroic troops and the army of the enemy. The valor of our\r\n     soldiers has won for them, at several points, marked advantages;\r\n     but in the north the pressure of the German forces has compelled us\r\n     to fall back.\r\n\r\n     This situation has compelled the President of the Republic and the\r\n     Government to take a painful decision.\r\n\r\n     In order to watch over the national welfare it is the duty of the\r\n     public powers to remove themselves temporarily from the City of\r\n     Paris.\r\n\r\n     Under the command of an eminent chief, a French Army, full of\r\n     courage and zeal, will defend the capital and its patriotic\r\n     population against the invader.\r\n\r\n     But the war must be carried on at the same time on the rest of its\r\n     territory.\r\n\r\n     Without peace or truce, without cessation or faltering, the\r\n     struggle for the honor of the nation and the reparation of violated\r\n     right must continue.\r\n\r\n     None of our armies is impaired. If some of them have sustained very\r\n     considerable losses, the gaps have immediately been filled up from\r\n     the reserves, and the appeal for recruits assures us of new\r\n     reserves in men and energy tomorrow.\r\n\r\n     Endure and fight! Such must be the motto of the allied British,\r\n     Russian, Belgian, and French Armies.\r\n\r\n     Endure and fight, while at sea the British aid us, cutting the\r\n     communication of our enemy with the world.\r\n\r\n     Endure and fight, while the Russians continue to advance to strike\r\n     the decisive blow at the heart of the German Empire.\r\n\r\n     It is the duty of the Government of the republic to direct this\r\n     stubborn resistance.\r\n\r\n     Everywhere Frenchmen will rise for their independence; but to\r\n     insure the utmost spirit and efficacy in the formidable fight it is\r\n     indispensable that the Government shall remain free to act. At the\r\n     request of the military authorities, the Government is therefore\r\n     temporarily transferring its headquarters to a place where it can\r\n     remain in constant touch with the whole of the country.\r\n\r\n     It requests members of Parliament not to remain away from it, in\r\n     order that they may form, with their colleagues, a bond of national\r\n     unity.\r\n\r\n     The Government only leaves Paris after having assured the defense\r\n     of the city and of the intrenched camp by every means in its power.\r\n\r\n     It knows that it does not need to recommend to the admirable\r\n     population of Paris that calm, resolution and coolness which it is\r\n     showing every day, and which is on a level with its highest\r\n     traditions.\r\n\r\n     People of France, let us all be worthy of these tragic\r\n     circumstances. We shall gain the final victory; we shall gain it by\r\n     unflagging will, endurance, and tenacity.\r\n\r\n     A nation which refuses to perish, and which, in order to live, does\r\n     not flinch either from suffering or sacrifice, is sure of victory.\r\n\r\n     The manifesto is signed by President Poincaré and all the\r\n     Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia to Her Enemy\r\n\r\nSlav Emperor Announces New Policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPledge of Czar Nicholas II. to Russia's Statesmen and Soldiers,\r\nin Winter Palace, St. Petersburg, Aug. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     War has been forced upon us.

Pourparlers were begun amid friendly relations with\r\n     Germany and her ally, Austria, for the blood and the property of\r\n     our subjects were dear to us.\r\n\r\n     Contrary to our hopes in our good neighborly relations of long\r\n     date, and disregarding our assurances that the mobilization\r\n     measures taken were in pursuance of no object hostile to her,\r\n     Germany demanded their immediate cessation. Being rebuffed in this\r\n     demand, Germany suddenly declared war on Russia.\r\n\r\n     Today it is not only the protection of a country related to us and\r\n     unjustly attacked that must be accorded, but we must safeguard the\r\n     honor, the dignity, and the integrity of Russia and her position\r\n     among the great powers.\r\n\r\n     We believe unshakably that all our faithful subjects will rise with\r\n     unanimity and devotion for the defense of Russian soil; that\r\n     internal discord will be forgotten in this threatening hour; that\r\n     the unity of the Emperor with his people will become still more\r\n     close, and that Russia, rising like one man, will repulse the\r\n     insolent attack of the enemy.\r\n\r\n     With a profound faith in the justice of our work, and with a humble\r\n     hope in omnipotent Providence in prayer, we call God's blessing on\r\n     holy Russia and her valiant troops.\r\n\r\n     NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCZAR AT THE KREMLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nResponse to Deputies of Moscow, Aug. 18.\r\n\r\n     At this stormy, warlike hour, which, suddenly and against my\r\n     wishes, has fallen upon my peaceful people, I seek, according to\r\n     the custom of my ancestors, to strengthen the forces of my soul in\r\n     the sanctuaries of Moscow.\r\n\r\n     Within the walls of the old Kremlin I greet in you, inhabitants of\r\n     Moscow, my beloved ancient capital, all my people, who everywhere,\r\n     in the villages of their birth, in the Duma, and in the Council of\r\n     the Empire, unanimously replied to my appeal and rose with vigor\r\n     throughout the country, forgetting all private differences, to\r\n     defend the land of their birth and the Slav race.\r\n\r\n     In a powerful common impulse all nationalities, all tribes of our\r\n     vast empire, have united. Russia, like myself, will never forget\r\n     these historic days.\r\n\r\n     This union of thought and sentiment in all my people affords me\r\n     deep consolation and a calm assurance for the future. From here,\r\n     from the heart of the Russian land, I send a warm greeting to my\r\n     gallant troops and to our brave Allies who are making common cause\r\n     with us to safeguard the down-trodden principles of peace and\r\n     truth. May God be with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEAL TO THE POLES.\r\n\r\nBy Grand Duke Nicholas, Generalissimo of the Russian Forces, St.\r\nPetersburg, Aug. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Poles: The hour has sounded when the sacred dream of your fathers\r\n     and your grandfathers may be realized. A century and a half has\r\n     passed since the living body of Poland was torn in pieces, but the\r\n     soul of the country is not dead. It continues to live, inspired by\r\n     the hope that there will come for the Polish people an hour of\r\n     resurrection, and of fraternal reconciliation with Great Russia.\r\n     The Russian Army brings you the solemn news of this reconciliation\r\n     which obliterates the frontiers dividing the Polish peoples, which\r\n     it unites conjointly under the sceptre of the Russian Czar. Under\r\n     this sceptre Poland will be born again, free in her religion and\r\n     her language. Russian autonomy only expects from you the same\r\n     respect for the rights of those nationalities to which history has\r\n     bound you. With open heart and brotherly hand Great Russia advances\r\n     to meet you. She believes that the sword, with which she struck\r\n     down her enemies at Grünwald, is not yet rusted. From the shores of\r\n     the Pacific to the North Sea the Russian armies are marching. The\r\n     dawn of a new life is beginning for you, and in this glorious dawn\r\n     is seen the sign of the cross, the symbol of suffering and of the\r\n     resurrection of peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLISH RESPONSE.\r\n\r\nStatement Issued by Four Political Parties, Aug. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The representatives of the undersigned political parties, assembled\r\n     in Warsaw on the 16th August, 1914, welcome the Proclamation issued\r\n     to the Poles by his Imperial Highness the Commander in Chief of the\r\n     Russian forces as an act of the foremost historical importance, and\r\n     implicitly believe that upon the termination of the war the\r\n     promises uttered in that proclamation will be formally fulfilled,\r\n     that the dreams of their fathers and forefathers will be realized,\r\n     that Poland's body, torn asunder a century and a half ago, will\r\n     once again be made whole, that the frontiers severing the Polish\r\n     nation will vanish.\r\n\r\n     The blood of Poland's sons, shed in united combat against the\r\n     Germans, will serve equally as a sacrifice, offered upon the altar\r\n     of her resurrection.\r\n\r\n     THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL PARTY.\r\n\r\n     THE POLISH PROGRESSIVE PARTY.\r\n\r\n     THE REALIST PARTY.\r\n\r\n     THE POLISH PROGRESSIVE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO ALLIANCE WITH GERMANY\r\n\r\nEditorial Appeal in the Gazeta Warszawska, Aug. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-countrymen! A danger threatens us, greatest, perhaps, among the\r\nmany calamities which war brings to a country; the misdirection of the\r\nnation's mind and understanding.\r\n\r\nVarious instigations are pressing the Poles to go against their own\r\ninstinct and the dictates of political reason in their attitude toward\r\nthe armies now invading our Polish lands, armies ringing with German\r\nwords of command, which even resound through Galician detachments lured\r\ninto belief that Poland may be saved through alliance with the Germans.\r\nVarious agitators on both the German and Austrian sides, having their\r\nown interests at stake, are seeking to make our people take active part\r\nin the terrific conflicts now to be fought out upon our soil.\r\n\r\nTo attain this end by throwing dust into our eyes, various manifestos\r\nsigned by the leaders of the armies beyond the frontier have promised\r\nthe Poles extensive liberties and privileges at the close of the war.\r\nCertain Polish organizations, having lost, in the general excitement,\r\ntheir healthy sense of judgment, are doing likewise. Do not let\r\nyourselves be hoodwinked by these promises. They are lies. Neither of\r\nthe invading armies has any intention of fighting for Poland's sake.\r\nEach is fighting in the interests of its own empire, and to those\r\nempires we are of no account. They only want, in a moment of necessity,\r\nto make the Poles passive instruments serving their own ends. Whoever\r\ntells you that Austria in alliance with Prussia intends to build up\r\nPoland once again is a blinded dreamer. The result of a victory for the\r\nGermans and Austrians would mean a new partitioning of Poland, a yet\r\ngreater wreckage of our nation. Grasp this, listen to no seducers.\r\nRemain passive, watchful, insensible to temptation.\r\n\r\nDuring the coming struggle the Kingdom of Poland will be the marching\r\nground of various armies, we shall see temporary victors assuming\r\nlordship for a while; but change of authority will follow, and\r\ninevitable retaliation; this several times, perhaps, in the course of\r\nthe campaign. Therefore every improvident step will meet with terrible\r\nrevenge. By holding firm through the present conflict you best can serve\r\nthe Polish cause. In the name of the love you bear your country, of your\r\nsolicitude for the nation's future, we entreat you, fellow-countrymen,\r\nto remain deaf to evil inspirations, unshakable in your determination\r\nnot to expose our land to yet greater calamities, and Poland's whole\r\nfuture to incalculable perils.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLISH AMERICAN OPINION.\r\n\r\nKazinirz Jaworowski, Manager Polish National Alliance, New York, Aug.\r\n16.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poles are treated better in Russia now than they are in Germany.\r\nAlthough Russia has done its best to Russianize Poland by crushing the\r\nPolish national feeling, imprisoning Polish patriots, and attempting\r\neven to suppress the Polish language, Germany has gone still further in\r\nits efforts to Germanize its Polish territory.\r\n\r\nBismarck's idea was to force German civilization upon the world and the\r\nmost extreme measures have been taken to enforce this policy in German\r\nPoland. Taking advantage of every possible pretext, the Germans have\r\ndispossessed the Poles of their land and handed it over to Germans. The\r\nRussians have not gone so far as this. They, as a general rule, have\r\nallowed the Poles to keep their land.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I would do anything to defeat Germany, and I think the\r\nPoles of Germany and Austria for the most part wish to see France and\r\nRussia successful The Poles are Slavs. The fight is between the Germans\r\nand the Slavs.\r\n\r\nI hope that if the Czar is successful, he carries out his promises to\r\nreunite Poland and grant it autonomy. That would not mean Poland would\r\nbe free, but it would enjoy more freedom than now. The Czar would be the\r\nKing of Poland and the Government of Poland undoubtedly would be carried\r\non largely by men appointed by the Czar. However, if Poland got the\r\nright to have a share in its Government, even if the Czar remained\r\nsupreme, the country would be greatly benefited.\r\n\r\nAutonomy would mean that efforts to suppress the Polish language, the\r\nPolish national spirit, and the Polish traditions would be at an end.\r\nUnder a despotic government in Russia and under more despotic\r\ngovernments still in Germany and Austria, the Polish race has existed\r\nunder the most crushing of burdens. Reunited and granted partial liberty\r\nand the right to live under fair conditions, it would flourish and again\r\ntake its place as a great race.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA AGAINST GERMANY.\r\n\r\nBy Prince Eugene Troubetskoi, Ex-Member of the Imperial Cabinet, St.\r\nPetersburg, Aug. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia against Germany is an instance of real patriotism against the\r\ncurse of nationalism. Our people are athrill now, not from hate but from\r\nan ardent desire to serve and protect. Our war cry does not result from\r\nthe ancient pagan conception of the self-sufficiency of the State, but\r\nfrom the desire for the well-being of all men.\r\n\r\nOur people are not filled by that fierce and implacable lust for power\r\nwhich leads a nation into the gulf whose depths reach down to hell. With\r\nus God is not conceived as merely a tribal deity, but the father of all.\r\nUpon these things, upon this supernational impulse which has now set our\r\npeople on fire, we rely for victory, and in our victory we expect to see\r\na great step taken in the coming freedom of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUMA'S MESSAGE TO BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nPresident Rodzianko of the Imperial Duma's Telegram to the House of\r\nCommons, Aug. 26.\r\n\r\n     The Duma of the empire, assembled in extraordinary session in view\r\n     of the exceptional events passing in the civilized world, begs the\r\n     House of Commons of Great Britain to accept their warm and sincere\r\n     greeting and sentiments of profound friendship which unite our two\r\n     great nations. The whole of Russia has welcomed with enthusiasm the\r\n     resolution of the British people to give their support to the\r\n     friendly nations in the historic struggle which is developing at\r\n     this moment. May God bless the armies of the friendly nations of\r\n     the Triple Entente! Long live his Majesty King George and his\r\n     valiant people! Long live the British Parliament, and long live\r\n     Great Britain!\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW POLICY AND THE JEWS.\r\n\r\nSpecial Cable to The New York Times, London, Aug. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since the Czar's promise of autonomy to Poland reports have been\r\ncurrent that the next step likely to be taken by the Russian Government\r\nalong the same lines of initiative will be a proclamation assuring the\r\nJews of equal civil and political rights. A Paris dispatch today goes\r\nthe length of stating that such a proclamation is shortly to be issued.\r\n\r\nFrom inquiries made in authoritative quarters THE NEW YORK TIMES is able\r\nto state that, while there is no official authority for such a\r\nprediction, there is good reason to believe that some measure of reform\r\nalong the lines indicated is likely. Both in France and England,\r\nRussia's reactionary policy is the only element which has aroused any\r\nmisgivings regarding what it is hoped in the two first-named countries\r\nwill be the results of the war.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm aroused in France by the decree affecting Poland gives\r\nthe measure of relief caused by the removal of these misgivings, so far\r\nas one section of the non-orthodox subjects of the Czar are concerned.\r\nEqual relief would be felt among a large and representative body of the\r\nBritish public were definite action taken by the Russian Government to\r\nremove the disabilities under which the Jews in Russia labor. I have\r\nauthority for stating that steps have been taken to bring this point of\r\nview to the attention of the Russian Government.\r\n\r\nOfficially, the British Government can take no action which could be\r\nregarded as an interference with the domestic affairs of a friendly\r\npower, and certain overzealous representations which have been made to\r\nSir Edward Grey overshoot the mark. Sir Edward Grey's liberal principles\r\nare sufficiently well recognized to make it certain that what he is able\r\nto do he is doing to remove all causes for the misgivings with which a\r\ngood number of his fellow-citizens regard the Russian alliance in its\r\nmoral aspect and its possible ultimate developments.\r\n\r\nGreat hopes are felt that these very delicate representations will meet\r\nwith success. Predictions are made that the final outcome of the\r\ncombined grant of autonomy to Poland and the removal of at least some of\r\nthe civil and religious disqualifications now weighing upon the Jews in\r\nRussia will be the growth of a new State, in which the Jew and the Pole\r\nwill find an equal place in the sun and flourish exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR ON GERMAN TRADE.\r\n\r\nM. Sazonof, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, to Correspondent of\r\nThe London Times, Petrograd, Sept. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the world just now are fixed on the fortunes of the armies\r\nin the field. It is, perhaps, not spectacular from the point of view of\r\nthe average newspaper reader to speak at this time of mere business and\r\ntrade relations. I quite well realize that it is accounts of victories\r\nand routs, acts of heroism and magnificent assaults by troops that sell\r\nthe newspapers, but beyond and above all this there now exists a\r\nsituation and an opportunity in trade and commerce with Russia which to\r\nEngland and America may mean more in decades to come than it is easy to\r\nrealize.\r\n\r\nFor years past Germany has been steadily and vigorously pushing her\r\ntrade into all quarters of the Russian Empire, and now sells us above\r\n£60,000,000 worth of products yearly. The ground has been broken by\r\nGermany, and these enormous markets for machinery, chemicals, and all\r\nsorts of manufactured products are now suddenly cut off from the avenues\r\nthrough which they have been supplied. Herein lies the greatest\r\ncommercial opportunity for England and America that has ever been\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nIt has been said in the Maxims of Pascal that to govern is to foresee.\r\nThis is not only true of politics and affairs of government, but applies\r\nas well to trade relations. It is that country which foresees the\r\nsituation commercially in Russia that will reap the enormous benefits\r\nthat these markets now offer.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely sufficient that merchants and manufacturers should\r\noffer their goods here. They that would profit permanently by the new\r\ntrade conditions of this empire must take up the task seriously. Experts\r\nshould be sent here now, even while the war is still in progress, to\r\nstudy and examine the wants of our country. Our duties, our manner of\r\ndoing business, our present and future wants and growing demands, should\r\nbe studied scientifically and fundamentally, so that when peace comes\r\nthose channels which have for decades flowed deeply with German products\r\nmay continue to flow with products from America and England.\r\n\r\nFor America especially does Russia open an opportunity for an industrial\r\noutlet such as can hardly be overestimated. We have an empire of\r\n170,000,000 souls, and the £60,000,000 yearly that we have been paying\r\nGermany is but the beginning of a demand that will soon make Russia\r\namong the most desirable and valuable markets in the world. Railroad\r\nbuilding and new developments everywhere are a prelude to an era of\r\nprosperity in this country such as has never been seen here before.\r\n\r\nI cannot too emphatically express the hope that merchants abroad will\r\nrealize this wonderful opportunity and act promptly, for when the war is\r\nover will come realization of this situation everywhere, and he who\r\nwould profit should take the first steps with the least possible delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOE TO GERMAN MILITARISM.\r\n\r\nStatement to Americans by Prince Imeretinsky, Sept. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are a peace-loving people as you in America are, but, of course, the\r\npeople of Russia are not so well educated as you are.\r\n\r\nRussia did not want this war, but she has known for years that it was\r\ncoming and consequently was preparing for it. It is her determination,\r\nnow that it has been brought on by Germany, to see it through, no matter\r\nhow long it takes or how much it costs.\r\n\r\nRussia is waging war against militarism. If continued, this militarism\r\nwould economically cripple all Europe. The burden is too heavy for\r\npeople to bear, and Russia means to put an end to militarism as\r\nexpounded by Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT A QUESTION OF SLAV PREDOMINANCE.\r\n\r\nStatement by Baron Korff, Imperial Russian Vice Consul, New York, Sept.\r\n6.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria at Serajevo, in\r\nthe light of present conditions, appears to be the pretext which led to\r\nthe present great European war, involving the Empires of Germany and\r\nRussia, the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Belgium, and the Republic of\r\nFrance. It is rather difficult for the average American to find the real\r\ncauses that have led to this struggle of nations, as they lie solely in\r\nthe conditions and latest developments of the political life of Middle\r\nEurope generally, and Germany and Austria particularly.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the real cause it will be necessary for me to\r\nexplain the policy of the above-named two Governments on one side and\r\nthe evolution of the character of the German Nation on the other side.\r\nIn glancing at the map of Germany, and particularly her frontiers and\r\ngeographical position, she being wedged in between two powerful\r\nneighbors, Russia in the east and France backed up by England in the\r\nwest, it is apparent that her situation is very delicate, owing to the\r\nlack of marked natural boundaries.\r\n\r\nTremendous military power and highly developed diplomatic ability are\r\nthe two necessary elements to create friendly relations with her\r\nneighbors. After the creation of the great German Empire in 1870, Prince\r\nBismarck succeeded in establishing and maintaining for Germany friendly\r\nrelations with the other great powers. It was his policy to acquire\r\ncolonies for Germany outside of Europe, and to carefully avoid any\r\nterritorial encroachments on the neighboring States. He sounded his\r\nwarning to his countrymen not to try to increase German territory at\r\nthe expense of Russian territory.\r\n\r\nGermany's colonial acquisitions created a new era in her policy, and, if\r\nI may be permitted to so express myself, changed completely the face of\r\nthe German Empire. The protection and development of her colonial\r\npossessions and her commerce required a strong navy. England's\r\ncompetition of the commerce controlled by Germany started the tremendous\r\ngrowth of England's naval power, and gave Germany second place. Her\r\nrivalry with England compelled Germany to increase her army, too, and we\r\nobserved how from a quiet, inoffensive, modest State Germany gradually\r\nbecame very strong and endeavored to play the first violin in the\r\nconcert not only of all Europe, but also of the whole world. Such seems\r\nto be the fate of all nations that acquire sudden power--they get\r\nconceited and aggressive.\r\n\r\nThe political events of the last ten years prove sufficiently the\r\naggressiveness of the German policy--the events at Agadir, the\r\nannexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria, the ultimatum sent by\r\nthe latter to Servia are only passing instances in the growing conceit\r\nof the German policy. It should be remembered that in March, 1909,\r\nChancellor von Bülow announced to the German Reichstag that Germany\r\nwould support Austria in her annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by\r\nforce, even if the whole of Europe were to oppose it.\r\n\r\nEurope at that time did not oppose the Germans, but it seems to me that\r\njust then Europe began to realize how dangerous and unsafe it was to\r\nhave in the heart of that Continent a power with such bellicose and\r\ndriving intentions. Her political acts were too uncanny and alarmed the\r\nwhole of Europe, which began to seek ways and means to get rid of this\r\nGerman hegemony, coupled with its rough militarism and unscrupulous ways\r\nof acting.\r\n\r\nThe military and economical developments of Germany induced her to go\r\nfurther in her tendency to enlarge her territory. Emperor William feels\r\nthat his empire is not big enough to suit his ambition and for the part\r\nwhich he intends to play in Europe. He therefore endeavors to enter into\r\nan agreement with the heir of the Austrian throne, Franz Ferdinand, a\r\nman of great energy and wide political views, to the effect to mold out\r\nof Austria an exclusive Slavish power and to surrender to Germany the\r\nArchduchy of Austria with Vienna and Tyrol, and annex Servia to Austria.\r\n\r\nFranz Ferdinand could afford to agree to this plan most readily, because\r\nhe knew that Austria in her present state could not continue her\r\nexistence, as she was on the brink of an insurrection of 25,000,000\r\nAustrian Slavs against the continuance of a Government over them of\r\n9,000,000 Austrian Germans. There is no doubt that this question was\r\nfully discussed at the conference at Konopish, where the German Emperor,\r\naccompanied by Admiral von Tirpitz, went to pay a visit to Franz\r\nFerdinand one month before the latter was assassinated.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of Serajevo found Germany after a course of action already\r\nhad been agreed upon, and the sending of the ultimatum by Austria to\r\nServia can be explained only by the desire of the two nations to fully\r\ncomplete their preparations.\r\n\r\nNow, why do we find at this important moment of the world's history such\r\nopposition not only against Germany but also an upheaval of other\r\nnations?\r\n\r\nThe German press of the United States endeavors to prove that the\r\nunderlying reason for the struggle is the eventual triumph in Europe\r\neither of Teutonic or Slavish civilization, and denounces Russian\r\nbarbarism and extols German culture.\r\n\r\nI will not discuss the respective merits of Teutonic and Slavic culture\r\nand civilization, as in my opinion these are questions absolutely\r\nforeign to the events leading up to the war. The Russian, French,\r\nEnglish, and Servian nations are not fighting against German culture,\r\nas represented by intellectual giants, such as Goethe, Wagner, and many\r\nothers, but against German militarism, accompanied by systematic\r\noppression of the individual residing in German territory.\r\n\r\nThis internal German policy created a national spirit against which the\r\nAllies now are fighting--the national spirit of Germany, which the whole\r\nworld knows, and which is rough, conceited, arrogant, and intolerant\r\ntoward foreigners beyond all measures, and admits nothing good unless it\r\nis German or made in Germany. This kind of German national spirit is in\r\nthe majority in the empire of Germany and particularly in Prussia; the\r\nreal cultured, good-hearted, sentimental German is about to die out\r\ncompletely, and the few remaining representatives of this type have no\r\nvoice in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe pronounced antipathy to the above-described present majority type of\r\nGermans united all European nations against Germany, and supports their\r\nrespective Governments in their efforts to put a stop to the furor\r\nteutonicus of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the task of the allied Governments will find unlimited\r\nsupport of the nations and this war against Germany in Europe will prove\r\nto be most popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA'S \"LITTLE BROTHER.\"\r\n\r\nStatement by George Bakhmeteff, Russian Ambassador to the United\r\nStates, New York, Oct. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be a long time, I suppose, before the American will be able\r\nfully to understand Russia's reasons for entering the present war and\r\nthe great racial thought that lies back of it. The whole situation in a\r\nnutshell is that Germany entered the war from racial hate and motives of\r\ncommercial greed, while Russia drew her sword out of motives of humane\r\nand kindly sympathy for a small and oppressed nation of her own kindred.\r\nGermany had been grabbing and wished to grab more; Russia rose in arms\r\nto stand by and protect her \"little brother.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed you are quite right when you say that there are spiritual forces\r\nback of Russia's deeds in battle far more than there can be in the case\r\nof any other of the warring nations. The reasons lie deep within our\r\nnational life, and I doubt if any American will be able fully to\r\ncomprehend them without coming to see us in our own country and seeing\r\nus as we are. The great and really wonderful achievements of the German\r\nare visible and material, while ours are things of the spirit--invisible,\r\nmodest, resigned. The representative spirit of Germany's materialism\r\nand heartless aggressiveness is that of the megalomaniac Nietzsche and\r\nhis followers, Treitschke and von Bernhardi. The spokesmen of what is\r\nmore truly Russian today are Tolstoy and Dostoievski, who have recorded\r\nforever the spirit of self-sacrifice, humility and piety in the Russian\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nYes, it is true that those who have learned to know us in Russia are\r\naware that the epithets of \"Hun\" and \"barbarian\" used against us are\r\nstark lies promulgated by bitter enemies who take ignoble advantage of\r\nthe tradition in America fostered by the melodramatic exploitation of\r\nthe Jewish problem and the occasional brutalities by our drunken soldier\r\nto make you believe that a Russian is a sort of treacherous bandit with\r\na knife in his teeth ready to betray and slay. We regret exceedingly\r\nthat that tradition has taken root in the United States. We admire and\r\nemulate Americans because they have mellowed and complemented their\r\nindustrial and political achievements with national charity and\r\nreligious ideals.\r\n\r\nIn Russia the Jewish question, as such, has not arisen since the opening\r\nof the war. Political promises have been made to Poland and these\r\npromises will be kept. It is a mistaken idea here that any overtures\r\nhave been made to the Jews as a class. You think we are as anxious as\r\nall that to have them enlist as soldiers? No. We do not wish to make\r\nthem any special inducements to enlist. You are well aware that nobody\r\nhates the Jews more cordially than the Pole himself. Our offer was to\r\nthe Poles, who have a national entity and a country and home of their\r\nown. The Jews have none of these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Facts About Belgium\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatement Issued by the Belgian Legation at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Belgian Legation at Washington has compiled the following statement\r\nof the Belgian case, in the present European War, in answer to the many\r\ninquiries that have been received on the subject._\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of April 19th, 1839, Prussia, France, England, Austria,\r\nand Russia declared themselves guarantors of the treaty concluded on the\r\nsame day between the King of the Belgians and the King of the\r\nNetherlands. This treaty provides:\r\n\r\n     Belgium forms an independent State of perpetual neutrality.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, Belgium was forbidden, in case of war, to take the part\r\nof any of the belligerents.\r\n\r\nSince then Belgium has fulfilled all her neutrality obligations; she has\r\nacted in a spirit of absolute impartiality. She has left nothing undone\r\nto maintain and make respected her neutrality. Germany's obligation to\r\nrespect Belgian neutrality was even more emphatically affirmed by one of\r\nGermany's greatest men, by the creator of the empire. Prince, then\r\nCount, Bismarck, wrote to Baron Nothomb, Belgian Minister in Berlin, on\r\nthe 22nd of July, 1870, as follows:\r\n\r\n     In confirmation of my verbal assurances, I have the honor to give\r\n     in writing a declaration which, in view of the treaties in force,\r\n     _is quite superfluous_, that the Confederation of the North and its\r\n     allies will respect the neutrality of Belgium on the understanding,\r\n     of course, that it is respected by the other belligerents.\r\n\r\nOn July 31 of the present year the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nand the Secretary General of the Foreign Office had a long conversation\r\nwith the German Minister in Brussels. It was pointed out to him that in\r\nthe course of the controversy raised in 1911 by the introduction of the\r\nDutch project for the fortification of the Scheldt, that his\r\npredecessor, Herr von Flotow, had assured the Belgian Government that in\r\nthe event of a Franco-German war Germany would not violate Belgian\r\nneutrality; that Mr. Bethmann-Hollweg, the Imperial Chancellor, had\r\ngiven similar assurance; that in 1913 Herr von Jagow, the German Foreign\r\nSecretary, had made similar statements of a reassuring character in the\r\nbudget committee of the Reichstag concerning the neutrality of Belgium;\r\nto which the German Minister replied that he was aware of the\r\nconversation with his predecessor, and that \"he was certain that the\r\nsentiments expressed at that epoch had not changed.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 2nd, in the course of the day, the German Minister in\r\nBrussels, M. De Below Saleske, gave an interview to the newspaper Le\r\nSoir, and declared that Belgium had nothing to fear from Germany. He\r\nwent so far as to employ this expression:\r\n\r\n     You will see, perhaps, your neighbor's house on fire, but your\r\n     house will remain intact.\r\n\r\nThe same day, at 7 o'clock in the evening, he communicated the following\r\nnote to the Belgian Government:\r\n\r\nThe German Note.\r\n\r\n     The German Government has received unimpeachable news to the effect\r\n     that the French forces have the intention of marching on the Meuse\r\n     by Givet and Namur. This news leaves no doubt as to the intention\r\n     of France to march upon Germany from Belgian territory. The\r\n     Imperial Government of Germany cannot help fearing that Belgium, in\r\n     spite of the best intentions, will not be in a position to repulse\r\n     without help an incursion by the French of such great magnitude. In\r\n     this case it is sufficiently certain that Germany is seriously\r\n     threatened. It is the urgent business of Germany to forestall this\r\n     attack on the part of the enemy. The German Government would be\r\n     filled with lively regret if Belgium were to regard as an act of\r\n     hostility against her the fact that her precautionary measures\r\n     oblige her to violate on her side Belgian territory.\r\n\r\n     In order to avoid the possibility of misunderstanding, the German\r\n     Government makes the following comment:\r\n\r\n     1st. Germany contemplates no act of hostility against Belgium. If\r\n     Belgium consents to assume in the war which is about to commence\r\n     the attitude of friendly neutrality toward Germany, the German\r\n     Government on its side engages, when peace is restored, to\r\n     guarantee the integrity of the kingdom and its possessions.\r\n\r\n     2nd. Germany engages herself, on the aforesaid conditions, to\r\n     evacuate Belgian territory as soon as peace is concluded.\r\n\r\n     3rd. If Belgium observes a friendly attitude, Germany is ready, in\r\n     co-operation with the authorities of the Government of Belgium, to\r\n     buy for cash everything that is necessary for her troops, and to\r\n     pay indemnities for damage done in Belgium; but if Belgium behaves\r\n     in a hostile manner against the troops, and in particular places\r\n     difficulties in the way of their advance by opposition by the\r\n     fortifications of the Meuse, or by the destruction of roads,\r\n     railways, tunnels, or other works, Germany will be obliged to\r\n     consider Belgium as an enemy.\r\n\r\n     In that case Germany will enter into no agreement with the kingdom,\r\n     but will allow the further relationship of the two States to be\r\n     left to the decision of arms. The German Government feels that it\r\n     is justified in hoping that this eventuality will not materialize\r\n     and that the Belgian Government will know how to take appropriate\r\n     measures to prevent its materialization. In that case the friendly\r\n     relations which unite the two neighboring States will become closer\r\n     and more lasting.\r\n\r\nSuch is the German note. It will be noticed that there is no question of\r\nthe alleged entry of French aviators and officers into Belgium, as has\r\nbeen stated in several papers here. The document, in fact, knocks that\r\nfable on the head. The only reason given for the violation of Belgian\r\nterritory is the alleged intention of the French Army to march upon\r\nGivet and Namur. This assertion is supported by no proof, and is denied\r\nby the French Government, which officially declared to Belgium and\r\nEngland its intention of not violating Belgian territory. On the\r\ncontrary, the premeditated intention of Germany to violate Belgian\r\nneutrality is proved in the most irrefutable way, namely, by the\r\naffirmation of the German Secretary of State himself, and by that of the\r\nGerman Chancellor.\r\n\r\nTo the request of Sir William Goschen, the English Ambassador in Berlin,\r\nto be allowed to know if Germany would pledge herself to respect the\r\nneutrality of Belgium, the German Secretary of State replied that \"this\r\nneutrality had already been violated by Germany.\" Herr von Jagow went\r\nagain into the\r\n\r\n     reasons why the Imperial Government had been obliged to take this\r\n     step, namely, that they had to advance into France by the quickest\r\n     and easiest way so as to be able to get well ahead with their\r\n     operations and endeavor to strike some decisive blow as early as\r\n     possible. It was a matter of life and death to them, for, if they\r\n     had gone by the more southern route, they could not have hoped, in\r\n     view of the paucity of the roads and the strength of the\r\n     fortresses, to have got through without formidable opposition\r\n     entailing great loss of time. This loss of time would mean time\r\n     gained by the Russians for the bringing up of their troops to the\r\n     German frontier. Rapidity of action was the great German asset,\r\n     while that of Russia was the inexhaustible supply of troops.\r\n     [Official Report of the British Ambassador in Berlin to the British\r\n     Government.]\r\n\r\n\"A Scrap of Paper.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation preceded by a few minutes that in which the German\r\nChancellor, giddy at the sight of the abyss into which Germany was\r\nfalling, uttered these celebrated words:\r\n\r\n     Just for a word, NEUTRALITY, a word which in war times has been so\r\n     often disregarded; just for A SCRAP OF PAPER, Great Britain is\r\n     going to make war on a kindred nation. At what price would that\r\n     compact [neutrality] have been kept? Has the British Government\r\n     thought of that?\r\n\r\nSir William Goschen replied, that fear of consequences would hardly be\r\nregarded as an excuse for breaking a solemn engagement. [Official report\r\nof the British Ambassador in Berlin to his Government.]\r\n\r\nIt is very clear from these documents that Germany had for a long time\r\npremeditated the violation of the neutrality of Belgium and that she has\r\neven reconciled herself to the terrible danger of war with Great\r\nBritain, rather than renounce the advantages she thought she would gain\r\nby not respecting the treaty. In the face of these confessions the\r\nallegations that France wished to violate the neutrality of Belgium, an\r\nallegation supported by no proof, falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nTo continue the analysis of the German note:\r\n\r\n     If Belgium consents to assume in the war which is about to commence\r\n     the attitude of friendly neutrality toward Germany, the German\r\n     Government, on its side, engages, when peace is restored, to\r\n     guarantee the integrity of the kingdom and its possessions.\r\n\r\nCould Belgium, without being false to her duties of neutrality, take up\r\nthe position which the German Government calls \"friendly neutrality\"?\r\nThat is to say, could she allow the German armies to pass without\r\nopposition through her territory? Can the German Government itself\r\nanswer that question?\r\n\r\nIt is enough to reread the conversation given above between the British\r\nAmbassador and the German Secretary of State to come to a clear\r\nconclusion in that respect. If the violation of Belgian territory was to\r\nprocure so signal an advantage to Germany that she had no fear of\r\nbringing on war with England to attain it, then for Belgium to lend\r\nherself to the passage of German troops must have meant the certainty of\r\nfatal consequences for France. Thus for Belgium to have yielded to the\r\nGerman ultimatum would _ipso facto_ have conferred a considerable\r\nadvantage to Germany, to the detriment of the other belligerent, and\r\nwould have constituted a breach of neutrality.\r\n\r\nGermany concludes her note by threats. She engages, on the condition\r\nalready defined, to evacuate Belgian territory at the conclusion of\r\npeace. If Belgium behaves in a hostile manner [_that is to say, if she\r\ndoes her duty_] Germany will be obliged to consider Belgium as an enemy.\r\nShe would then leave the ultimate arrangements of the relations of the\r\ntwo States to the decision of arms. In other words, if Belgium does not\r\nagree to violate the treaty, Germany will treat her as an enemy, and she\r\nadds a veiled threat of annexing a part or the whole of her territory.\r\n\r\nThe moral fibre of nations is not always measured by their size or\r\npower. Belgium is small and weak, but her answer bears witness to her\r\nlove of justice and to her respect of the right. She would rather die\r\nwith honor than live dishonored.\r\n\r\nThat was made clear by the answer of her Government. The answer was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nReply to German Note.\r\n\r\n     The German note has been a painful surprise to the Belgian\r\n     Government. The intentions which the note attributes to France are\r\n     in contradiction to the formal declarations which were made to us\r\n     on the 1st of August in the name of the republic. Besides, if\r\n     contrary to our expectations, France is about to violate the\r\n     neutrality of Belgium, Belgium would be prepared to fulfil its\r\n     neutrality obligations, and her army would offer to the invader the\r\n     most vigorous resistance. The treaties of 1839, confirmed by the\r\n     treaties of 1870, commit to the guarantee of the powers and notably\r\n     to the Government of his Majesty the King of Prussia the\r\n     independence and neutrality of the Kingdom of Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the German Empire said in a sitting of the Reichstag\r\non the 4th of August:\r\n\r\n     We are in a state of legitimate defense _Necessity knows no law_.\r\n     Our troops have occupied Luxemburg and have perhaps already\r\n     penetrated into Belgium. This is against the law of nations.\r\n     France, it is true, has declared to Brussels that she is determined\r\n     to respect the neutrality of Belgium as long as her adversary\r\n     respects it, but we know that France was ready to invade Belgium.\r\n     France can afford to wait; we cannot. A French attack on our flank\r\n     in the region of the lower Rhine might have been fatal. It is for\r\n     that reason we have been compelled to ignore the just protests of\r\n     the Governments of Luxemburg and Belgium. The _injustice_ which we\r\n     thus commit we will _repair_ as soon as our military object has\r\n     been attained.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown how much value can be attached to the assertion of the\r\nalleged intention of France to invade Belgium. That intention, and the\r\nrealization of that intention belongs exclusively to Germany and they\r\nmust be left in her possession. This is especially the case in view of\r\nthe fact that the military dispositions undertaken by France absolutely\r\nrefute the allegations of the German Chancellor. So true is this that\r\nwhen the violation of Belgian territory became an accomplished fact, and\r\nwhen the King of Belgium appealed under the terms of the treaty of 1839\r\nfor support, in maintaining the neutrality of Belgium which these powers\r\nhad guaranteed, France was so little prepared to invade Belgium that it\r\ntook her more than ten days to get her troops into the country.\r\n\r\nThe world is familiar with the way Germany has repaired in Belgium the\r\ninjustice of which she was guilty, to use the words of the German\r\nChancellor.\r\n\r\nAtrocities in Belgium.\r\n\r\nUnder the pretext that her troops were attacked by civilians, and even\r\nunder no pretext at all, whole villages have been razed to the ground.\r\nImportant towns whose boast it was to represent part of the common\r\ninheritance of civilization were not spared. Their monuments, which have\r\nbeen respected during the centuries in all of the constant wars of which\r\nBelgium has been the theatre, were deliberately destroyed. Open cities\r\nwere bombarded. Exorbitant taxation was imposed upon conquered towns,\r\nand when the inhabitants were unable to pay the taxes, a large number of\r\ntheir houses were set on fire. That is what happened to Wavre, among\r\nother cities, whose 8,500 inhabitants were unable to pay a tax of\r\n$600,000. Termonde, with 10,000 inhabitants, was utterly destroyed. On\r\nthe 15th of September, there only remained in that town 282 houses out\r\nof 1,400. The town of Aerschot, with 8,000 inhabitants, is now nothing\r\nbut a mass of ruins and more than 150 of its inhabitants have been shot.\r\nDirigible balloons have thrown bombs at night upon Antwerp. It cannot be\r\nmaintained by those who were in the balloons that they were trying to\r\nhit the forts, as the forts are outside the boundaries of the town, and\r\na good distance outside them as well. Nor could the bombs thrown have\r\nhad any effect upon the forts, which are even stronger than those of\r\nLiége. There was no warning of this bombardment, a fact which\r\nconstitutes a violation of Article 26 of the Fourth Convention of The\r\nHague, and more than a dozen people were killed, all of them\r\nnon-combatants and several of them women and children.\r\n\r\nThe town of Louvain, with its 42,000 inhabitants, was one of the centres\r\nof Belgian culture. It had no mercy shown to it and has been nearly\r\nobliterated. Several quarters of the town were set on fire, the Church\r\nof St. Pierre, a marvelous example of Gothic art; the buildings of the\r\nUniversity, including the Library with more than 70,000 volumes, of\r\nwhich a large number were ancient manuscripts, the collections belonging\r\nto the University; nearly all the scientific institutions, and nearly\r\nall the houses of the town were _deliberately_ burned. They are now\r\nnothing more than heaps of ashes. Their destruction has been a loss to\r\nthe whole civilized world.\r\n\r\nNumbers of absolutely innocent women and children lost their lives in\r\nthe fire which was started by order of the German military officials. Of\r\nthose who were saved, several thousand, including women enfeebled by\r\nage, and children in arms, are today wandering homeless over the roads,\r\nwithout food or clothing. They are not to blame for anything, unless it\r\nis because they belong to a nation which has refused to purchase peace\r\nat the price of dishonor. That can be the only crime accounted to them\r\nand it is for that they have lost all their possessions upon the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom the declaration made by the Imperial German Chancellor it may be\r\nseen that the German Government is conscious of its wrongdoing. As one\r\nof the guarantors of Belgium's neutrality, it wanted to force Belgium to\r\nrelinquish its neutrality for Germany's benefit. Because Belgium would\r\nnot consent to this injustice and because Germany could not reproach her\r\nwith anything else, Germany invaded and covered with blood and ruin a\r\nsmall peaceful country of hard-working and honest people, a country\r\nwhich it had promised to protect.\r\n\r\nThis attack upon her neutrality is the first violation for which Belgium\r\nasks judgment from the universal conscience.\r\n\r\nThe entire Belgo-German question today is dominated by the fact of this\r\nviolation of the neutrality of Belgium. Therefore, there is not a single\r\nshot fired by a German soldier in Belgium, which is not manifestly and\r\navowedly belying most sacred things: the keeping of a solemn pledge, and\r\nthe right for an honest nation that never wanted war, nor showed\r\naggressive dispositions, to be allowed to live its peaceful and neutral\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nSuch is the Belgian case. Humanity will judge it.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelgo-British Plot Alleged by Germany\r\n\r\nStatement Issued by German Embassy at Washington, Oct. 13.\r\n\r\nThe German Ambassador drew special attention today to the telegram which\r\ncame from German headquarters. This telegram proves the German\r\ncontention that the Allies did not intend to respect Belgian neutrality.\r\nIt even proves more, namely, that Belgian neutrality practically did not\r\nexist and that the Belgian Government was conspiring with the Allies\r\nagainst Germany. Notwithstanding the denials coming from French sources\r\nit is a fact that French prisoners were taken at Liége and Namur, who\r\nacknowledged that they had been in those fortresses before the German\r\ntroops entered Belgium.\r\n\r\nOn the French side it has been asserted that the German Chancellor in\r\nParliament had acknowledged that Germany was doing wrong in violating\r\nBelgian neutrality. It must, however, not be overlooked that the\r\nChancellor further said:\r\n\r\n     We know that the Allies do not intend to respect Belgian\r\n     neutrality, and Germany, in the position she is in, attacked from\r\n     three sides, cannot wait, while the Allies can wait.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Belgian archives were not at the disposal of the German\r\nGovernment. If the Chancellor had known at the time he made his speech\r\nthat Belgium was not neutral he would certainly have spoken of the\r\nalleged Belgian neutrality in a different way.\r\n\r\nGermany has violated the frontiers of no really neutral country, while\r\nthe Allies are on record for disregarding all obligations toward China.\r\n\r\nText of Wireless Message.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters report German military authorities searching archives of\r\nBelgian General Staff at Brussels, found portfolio inscribed\r\n\"Intervention Anglaise-Belgique,\" containing important documents:\r\n\r\n     1.

France doubtful protectors,\r\n     Barnardiston's insinuations relative Flushing question, both\r\n     perfidious and naïve postulates dressing plan of battle against\r\n     threatening Franco-British invasion into Belgium in Franco-German\r\n     war.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN'S DENIAL.\r\n\r\nStatement Issued by British Foreign Office, London, Oct. 14.\r\n\r\nThe story of an alleged Anglo-Belgian agreement of 1906, published in\r\nthe German press and based on documents said to have been found at\r\nBrussels is only a press edition of a story which has been reproduced in\r\nvarious forms and denied on several occasions. No such agreement has\r\never existed as Germans well know. Gen. Grierson is dead and Col., now\r\nGen., Barnardiston is commanding the British forces before Tsing-tau.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 Gen. Grierson was on the General Staff at the War Office and\r\nCol. Barnardiston was military attaché at Brussels. In view of the\r\nsolemn guarantee given by Great Britain to protect the neutrality of\r\nBelgium against violation from any side some academic discussions may,\r\nthrough the instrumentality of Col. Barnardiston, have taken place\r\nbetween Gen. Grierson and the Belgian military authorities as to what\r\nassistance the British Army might be able to afford to Belgium should\r\none of her neighbors violate that neutrality. Some notes with reference\r\nto the subject may exist in the archives at Brussels.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the date mentioned, namely 1906, was the year\r\nfollowing that in which Germany had, as in 1911, adopted a threatening\r\nattitude toward France with regard to Morocco and in view of the\r\napprehensions existing of an attack on France through Belgium it was\r\nnatural that possible eventualities should be discussed.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of Belgium having been a party to any agreement of the\r\nnature indicated or to any design for violation of Belgian neutrality is\r\nclearly shown by reiterated declarations that she has made for many\r\nyears past that she would resist to the utmost any violation of her\r\nneutrality from whatever quarter and in whatever form such violation\r\nmight come. It is worthy of attention that these charges of aggressive\r\ndesigns on the part of other powers are made by Germany who, since 1906,\r\nhas established an elaborate network of strategical railways leading\r\nfrom the Rhine to the Belgian frontier through a barren, thinly\r\npopulated tract, deliberately constructed to permit of the sudden attack\r\nupon Belgium which was carried out two months ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nStatement by Count von Bernstorff, German Ambassador, Washington, Oct.\r\n15.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the Anglo-Belgian military agreement existing since 1906, a\r\nformal denial has been issued by England, which proves nothing. The\r\ndocuments are in the hands of the German authorities, and will be\r\npublished in full. The facts remain that a so-called \"neutral\" country\r\nconcluded a military agreement with England, which provided for landing\r\nof British troops in this \"neutral\" country. The document proves that by\r\nits own free will \"neutral Belgium\" accepted the British offer and\r\ndecided to fight on the side of the Allies.\r\n\r\nEngland instigated Belgium to go to war, and when the time came to\r\nprotect the unfortunate little country it was left to its own resources.\r\nGermany, on the other hand, which had heard of Belgium's agreement with\r\nEngland at the beginning of this war, offered to protect Belgium and to\r\npay full indemnity for all her losses. Germany would have religiously\r\nkept her promise.\r\n\r\nThe documents found in Brussels further prove that as far back as 1906\r\nEngland was systematically trying to bring about the coalition which has\r\nnow forced war on Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAY BOOK'S TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\nStatement by E. Havenith, Belgian Minister to the United States,\r\nWashington, Oct. 22.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian Legation has just received the copies of the \"Gray Book.\" It\r\nis evident from these documents that there has never existed any\r\nmilitary agreement between Belgium and England, either offensive or\r\ndefensive, such as the German Government asserts to have been in\r\nexistence since 1906. The following extracts speak for themselves:\r\n\r\n     _No. 28--Offer of intervention by England. Note handed to Sir\r\n     Francis H. Villiers, British Minister to Belgium, to M. Davignon,\r\n     Minister of Foreign Affairs._\r\n\r\n     Brussels, Aug. 4, 1914.\r\n\r\n     I am instructed to inform the Belgium Government that, if Germany\r\n     exercises pressure for the purpose of compelling Belgium to abandon\r\n     her position of a neutral country, the Government of his Britannic\r\n     Majesty expects Belgium to resist by every possible means.\r\n\r\n     The Government of his Britannic Majesty is ready in that event to\r\n     join with Russia and France, if desired by Belgium, to offer to the\r\n     Belgian Government at once common action for the purpose of\r\n     resisting the use of force by Germany against Belgium and at the\r\n     same time to offer a guarantee to maintain the independence and\r\n     integrity of Belgium in the future.\r\n\r\n     _No. 37--Offer of England for an alliance for the object of\r\n     assuring the neutrality of Belgium against the pressure of\r\n     Germany._\r\n\r\n     London, Aug. 4, 1914.\r\n\r\n     The Minister of Foreign Affairs has informed the British Ministers\r\n     in Norway, Holland, and Belgium that Great Britain expects that\r\n     these three kingdoms will resist the pressure of Germany and\r\n     maintain neutrality. They will be supported in their resistance by\r\n     England, who in such a case is ready to co-operate with France and\r\n     Russia, if such is the desire of these three Governments, in\r\n     offering an alliance to the said Governments to repel the\r\n     employment of force against them by Germany and a guarantee for the\r\n     future maintenance of the independence and the integrity of the\r\n     three kingdoms.\r\n\r\n     I pointed out that Belgium is neutral in perpetuity. The Minister\r\n     for Foreign Affairs replied: \"It is for the event of neutrality\r\n     being violated.\"\r\n\r\n     (Signed) LALAING,\r\n\r\n     Belgium Minister in London.\r\n\r\n     _No. 40--Belgium appeals to the powers after the invasion of\r\n     Belgium._\r\n\r\n     Brussels, Aug. 4, 1914.\r\n\r\n     Monsieur le Ministre--The Belgium Government regrets to have to\r\n     announce to your Excellency that this morning the armed forces of\r\n     Germany penetrated into Belgian territory, violating the\r\n     engagements which they have undertaken by treaty.\r\n\r\n     The Belgian Government are firmly decided to resist by all means in\r\n     their power.\r\n\r\n     Belgium appeals to England, to France, and to Russia to co-operate\r\n     as guarantors in the defense of her territory.\r\n\r\n     There should be a concerted and common action, having as its object\r\n     to resist the measures of force employed by Germany against Belgium\r\n     and at the same time to guarantee the maintenance of the\r\n     independence and integrity of Belgium for the future.\r\n\r\n     Belgium is happy to be able to declare that she will undertake the\r\n     defense of the fortified places. I am, &c.,\r\n\r\n     (Signed) DAVIGNON,\r\n\r\n     Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium.\r\n\r\nWhere is to be found the alleged military convention said to have been\r\nconcluded in 1906 with England? Where is the agreement said to have\r\nexisted since 1906 between the Allies to force war on Germany? These\r\ndocuments clearly prove that such compact never existed.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian nation preferred ruin and death to the shameful perjury\r\nproposed to her by Germany. For this reason Germany has devastated and\r\nimmersed in blood a peaceful little country. Today she seeks to rob her\r\nof honor, her only remaining treasure.\r\n\r\nThe official documents, the confessions of the German statesmen, the\r\nruins of Louvain, Malines, Aerschot, Termonde, and of so many villages\r\nburned and razed to the ground, the blood of her children unjustly\r\nmassacred are the testimonies which the Belgian people cites before the\r\ntribunal of public conscience. To this tribunal, without fear, the\r\nBelgian Nation confides the cause of her honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM'S ANSWER.\r\n\r\nTransmitted to The London Times and Published Oct. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Times of Oct. 14 reproduces a long article from The North-German\r\nGazette commenting on the discovery in the archives at Brussels of a map\r\nentitled \"English Intervention in Belgium\" and of a memorandum to the\r\nBelgian Minister of War which goes to prove that in the month of April,\r\n1906, the Chief of the General Staff, on the suggestion of the British\r\nMilitary Attaché and with the approval of Gen. Grierson, had worked out\r\na plan of co-operation between British expeditionary forces and the\r\nBelgian Army against Germany in the event of a Franco-German war. This\r\nagreement is assumed to have been preceded in all probability by a\r\nsimilar arrangement with the French General Staff.\r\n\r\nThe North-German Gazette also publishes certain passages of a report of\r\nthe Belgian Minister at Berlin in December, 1911, relating to another\r\nplan of the Belgian General Staff, in which the measures to be taken in\r\ncase of the violation of Belgian neutrality by Germany are discussed.\r\nBaron Greindl pointed out that this plan dealt only with the precautions\r\nto be taken in the event of an aggression on the part of Germany, while,\r\nowing to its geographical situation, Belgium might just as well be\r\nexposed to an attack by France and England. The North-German Gazette\r\ndraws from this discovery the strange conclusion that England intended\r\nto drag Belgium into the war, and at one time contemplated the violation\r\nof Dutch neutrality.\r\n\r\nWe have only one regret to express on the subject of the disclosure of\r\nthese documents, and that is that the publication of our military\r\ndocuments should be mangled and arranged in such a way as to give the\r\nreader the impression of duplicity on the part of England and adhesion\r\nby Belgium, in violation of her duties as a neutral State, to the policy\r\nof the Triple Entente. We ask the North-German Gazette to publish in\r\nfull the result of its search among our secret documents. Therein will\r\nbe found fresh and striking proof of the loyalty, correctness, and\r\nimpartiality with which Belgium for 81 years has discharged her\r\ninternational obligations.\r\n\r\nIt was stated that Col. Barnardiston, the military representative at\r\nBrussels of a power guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium, at the time\r\nof the Algeciras crisis, questioned the Chief of the Belgian General\r\nStaff as to the measures which he had taken to prevent any violation of\r\nthat neutrality. The Chief of the General Staff, at that time Lieut.\r\nGen. Ducarne, replied that Belgium was ready to repel any invader. Did\r\nthe conversation extend beyond these limits, and did Col. Barnardiston,\r\nin an interview of a private and confidential nature, disclose to Gen.\r\nDucarne the plan of campaign which the British General Staff would have\r\ndesired to follow if that neutrality were violated? We doubt it, but in\r\nany case we can solemnly assert, and it will be impossible to prove the\r\ncontrary, that never has the King or his Government been invited, either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, to join the Triple Entente in the event of a\r\nFranco-German war. By their words and by their acts they have always\r\nshown such a firm attitude that any supposition that they could have\r\ndeparted from the strictest neutrality is eliminated a priori.\r\n\r\nAs for Baron Greindl's dispatch of Dec. 23, 1911, it dealt with a plan\r\nfor the defense of Luxembourg, due to the personal initiative of the\r\nChief of the First Section of the War Ministry. This plan was of an\r\nabsolutely private character and had not been approved by the Minister\r\nof War. If this plan contemplated above all an attack by Germany, there\r\nis no cause for surprise, since the great German military writers, in\r\nparticular T. Bernhardi, V. Schlivfeboch, and von der Goltz, spoke\r\nopenly in their treatises on the coming war of the violation of Belgian\r\nterritory by the German armies.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of hostilities the Imperial Government, through the\r\nmouth of the Chancellor and of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, did\r\nnot search for vain pretexts for the aggression of which Belgium has\r\nbeen the victim. They justified it on the plea of military interests.\r\nSince then, in face of the universal reprobation which this odious\r\naction has excited, they have attempted to deceive public opinion by\r\nrepresenting Belgium as bound already before the war to the Triple\r\nEntente. These intrigues will deceive nobody. They will recoil on the\r\nhead of Germany. History will record that this power, after binding\r\nitself by treaty to defend the neutrality of Belgium, took the\r\ninitiative in violating it, without even finding a pretext with which to\r\njustify itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO BEGAN THE WAR, AND WHY?\r\n\r\nATROCITIES OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIS HOLINESS THE LATE POPE PIUS X.\r\n(_From a Painting by A.

Now I am impotent and forced to see the spectacle of my\r\n     own children, even those who yesterday worked here with me, leaving\r\n     for the war and abandoning their cassocks and cowls for soldiers'\r\n     uniforms. Yesterday, although belonging to different nationalities,\r\n     we were here studying in sympathetic companionship.

Such bullets were found not only on\r\n     French killed and wounded soldiers and on French prisoners, but\r\n     also on English troops. You know what terrible wounds and awful\r\n     suffering are caused by these bullets, and that their use is\r\n     strictly forbidden by the generally recognized rules of\r\n     international warfare.\r\n\r\n     I solemnly protest to you against the way in which this war is\r\n     being waged by our opponents, whose methods are making it one of\r\n     the most barbarous in history. Besides the use of these awful\r\n     weapons, the Belgian Government openly incited the civil population\r\n     to participate in the fighting, and has for a long time carefully\r\n     organized their resistance. The cruelties practiced in this\r\n     guerrilla warfare, even by women and priests, toward wounded\r\n     soldiers, and doctors and hospital nurses--physicians were killed\r\n     and lazarets fired on--were such that eventually my Generals were\r\n     compelled to adopt the strongest measures to punish the guilty and\r\n     frighten the bloodthirsty population from continuing their shameful\r\n     deeds.\r\n\r\n     Some villages and even the old town of Louvain, with the exception\r\n     of its beautiful town hall, (Hotel de Ville,) had to be destroyed\r\n     for the protection of my troops.\r\n\r\n     My heart bleeds when I see such measures inevitable and when I\r\n     think of the many innocent people who have lost their houses and\r\n     property as a result of the misdeeds of the guilty.\r\n\r\n     WILHELM I.

It would be unwise, it would be premature,\r\n     for a single Government, however fortunately separated from the\r\n     present struggle, it would even be inconsistent with the neutral\r\n     position of any nation which, like this, has no part in the\r\n     contest, to form or express a final judgment.\r\n\r\n     I speak thus frankly because I know that you will expect and wish\r\n     me to do so as one friend speaks to another, and because I feel\r\n     sure that such a reservation of judgment until the end of the war,\r\n     when all its events and circumstances can be seen in their entirety\r\n     and in their true relations, will commend itself to you as a true\r\n     expression of sincere neutrality.\r\n\r\n     WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARGE AGAINST GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Poincare of the French Republic to President Wilson, Sept.\r\n11.\r\n\r\n     Mr. President: I am informed that the German Government is\r\n     attempting to abuse your Excellency's good faith by alleging that\r\n     dumdum bullets are manufactured in French State workshops, and are\r\n     used by our soldiers. The calumny is nothing but an audacious\r\n     attempt to reverse the rôles.

DELCASSE'S NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench Cabinet Minister Addresses the Danish Government, Sept. 10.\r\n\r\nThe French Government protested on Aug. 18 to the Permanent Bureau of\r\nThe Hague Court of Arbitration against the use of dumdum bullets by the\r\nGermans, producing proof obtained by surgeons that French soldiers had\r\nbeen killed or wounded by these bullets. The German General Staff has\r\ncountered this by alleging that it was the French and English who used\r\nthe bullets, and the Imperial Chancellor has announced in fiery tones\r\nthat in the presence of the example given by the English and French the\r\nGerman soldiers would henceforth use dumdum bullets; the responsibility\r\nfor this procedure, which he himself describes as an act of cruelty and\r\na violation of an international convention signed by Germany, will rest,\r\nhe says, upon the powers of the Triple Entente.\r\n\r\nBy my Government's orders I have the honor to protest in the most formal\r\nmanner to the Danish Government against the lying German allegations.\r\nFrench soldiers have never used dumdum bullets. The French Government\r\nhas never authorized, nor will authorize, its troops to use such\r\nbarbarous means of warfare, whatever be the infringements of law and the\r\ncruelties committed by its adversaries. The \"Instructions for French\r\nOfficers in Wartime\" also lay down, and will continue to lay down, that\r\nthey are to forbid their men to use bullets at variance with the\r\nstipulations of the Geneva and Hague conventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALBERT, KING OF THE BELGIANS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELGIAN MISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficially Explained to President Wilson at the White House,\r\nWashington, Sept. 16.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the King of the Belgians has appointed a special envoy for\r\nthe purpose of acquainting the President of the United States of America\r\nwith the deplorable state of affairs prevailing in Belgium, whose\r\nneutrality has been unjustly violated, and who since the beginning of\r\nhostilities has been the theatre of the worst outrages on the part of\r\nthe invading German Army, in defiance of rules solemnized by\r\ninternational treaty and customs consecrated by public right and law of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Carton de Wiart, Minister of Justice, has been chosen for this\r\nmission.

DE WIART'S ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMade to the President at the White House, Washington, Sept. 16.\r\n\r\nExcellency: His Majesty the King of the Belgians has charged us with a\r\nspecial mission to the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nLet me say to you how much we feel ourselves honored to have been called\r\nupon to express the sentiments of our King and of our whole nation to\r\nthe illustrious statesman whom the American people have called to the\r\nhighest dignity of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned, I have already been able, during a previous\r\ntrip, to fully appreciate the noble virtues of the American Nation, and\r\nI am happy to take this opportunity to express all the admiration with\r\nwhich they inspire me.\r\n\r\nEver since her independence was first established, Belgium has been\r\ndeclared neutral in perpetuity. This neutrality, guaranteed by the\r\npowers, has recently been violated by one of them. Had we consented to\r\nabandon our neutrality for the benefit of one of the belligerents, we\r\nwould have betrayed our obligations toward the others. And it was the\r\nsense of our international obligations as well as that of our dignity\r\nand honor that has driven us to resistance.\r\n\r\nThe consequences suffered by the Belgian Nation were not confined purely\r\nto the harm occasioned by the forced march of an invading army. This\r\narmy not only seized a great portion of our territory, but it committed\r\nincredible acts of violence, the nature of which is contrary to the law\r\nof nations.\r\n\r\nPeaceful inhabitants were massacred, defenseless women and children were\r\noutraged, open and undefended towns were destroyed, historical and\r\nreligious monuments were reduced to dust, and the famous library of the\r\nUniversity of Louvain was given to the flames.\r\n\r\nOur Government has appointed a judicial commission to make an official\r\ninvestigation, so as to thoroughly and impartially examine the facts and\r\nto determine the responsibility thereof, and I will have the honor,\r\nExcellency, to hand over to you the proceedings of the inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn this frightful holocaust which is sweeping all over Europe, the\r\nUnited States has adopted a neutral attitude.\r\n\r\nAnd it is for this reason that your country, standing apart from either\r\none of the belligerents, is in the best position to judge, without bias\r\nor partiality, the conditions under which the war is being waged.\r\n\r\nIt is at the request, even at the initiative, of the United States that\r\nall civilized nations have formulated and adopted at The Hague a law\r\nregulating the laws and usage of war.\r\n\r\nWe refuse to believe that war has abolished the family of civilized\r\npowers, or the regulations to which they have freely consented.\r\n\r\nThe American people has always displayed its respect for justice, its\r\nsearch for progress, and an instinctive attachment for the laws of\r\nhumanity. Therefore, it has won a moral influence which is recognized by\r\nthe entire world. It is for this reason that Belgium, bound as she is to\r\nyou by ties of commerce and increasing friendship, turns to the American\r\npeople at this time to let it know the real truth of the present\r\nsituation. Resolved to continue unflinching defense of its sovereignty\r\nand independence, it deems it a duty to bring to the attention of the\r\ncivilized world the innumerable grave breaches of rights of mankind of\r\nwhich she has been a victim. At the very moment we were leaving\r\nBelgium, the King recalled to us his trip to the United States and the\r\nvivid and strong impression your powerful and virile civilization left\r\nupon his mind.\r\n\r\nOur faith in your fairness, our confidence in your justice, in your\r\nspirit of generosity and sympathy--all these have dictated our present\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT WILSON'S REPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddressed to the Royal Belgian Commission in the White House,\r\nWashington, Sept. 16.\r\n\r\nPermit me to say with what sincere pleasure I receive you as\r\nrepresentatives of the King of the Belgians, a people for whom the\r\npeople of the United States feel so strong a friendship and admiration,\r\na King for whom they entertain so sincere a respect, and express my hope\r\nthat we may have many opportunities of earning and deserving their\r\nregard.\r\n\r\nYou are not mistaken in believing that the people of this country love\r\njustice, seek the true paths of progress, and have a passionate regard\r\nfor the rights of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of profound pride to me that I am permitted for a time to\r\nrepresent such a people and to be their spokesman, and I am proud that\r\nyour King should have turned to me in time of distress as to one who\r\nwould wish on behalf of the people he represents to consider the claims\r\nto the impartial sympathy of mankind of a nation which deems itself\r\nwronged.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the document you have put in my hands containing the\r\nresult of an investigation made by a judicial committee appointed by the\r\nBelgian Government to look into the matter of which you have come to\r\nspeak. It shall have my utmost attentive perusal and my most thoughtful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nYou will, I am sure, not expect me to say more. Presently, I pray God\r\nvery soon, this war will be over. The day of accounting will then come,\r\nwhen, I take it for granted, the nations of Europe will assemble to\r\ndetermine a settlement. Where wrongs have been committed their\r\nconsequences and the relative responsibility involved will be assessed.\r\n\r\nThe nations of the world have, fortunately, by agreement made a plan for\r\nsuch a reckoning and settlement. What such a plan cannot compass, the\r\nopinion of mankind, the final arbiter in such matters, will supply. It\r\nwould be unwise, it would be premature for a single Government, however\r\nfortunately separated from the present struggle, it would be\r\ninconsistent with the neutral position of any nation, which, like this,\r\nhas no part in the contest, to form or express a final judgment.\r\n\r\nI need not assure you that this conclusion, in which I instinctively\r\nfeel that you will yourselves concur, is spoken frankly because in warm\r\nfriendship, and as the best means of perfect understanding between us,\r\nan understanding based upon mutual respect, admiration, and cordiality.\r\n\r\nYou are most welcome and we are greatly honored that you should have\r\nchosen us as the friends before whom you could lay any matter of vital\r\nconsequence to yourselves, in the confidence that your cause would be\r\nunderstood and met in the same spirit in which it was conceived and\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nFindings Presented by the Belgian Royal Commission to President Wilson\r\nat Washington, Sept. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nActs at Linsmeau and Orsmael.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelgium, which wanted peace, has been obliged by Germany to resort to\r\narms and to oppose a legitimate defense to an aggression which nothing\r\ncan justify, and which is contrary to the solemn pledges of treaties.\r\n\r\nBelgium is bound in honor to fight loyally and to observe all the rules,\r\nlaws, and customs of war.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the invasion of its territory by German troops,\r\nthe Belgian Government had posted each and every day, in all the towns,\r\nand the papers have each day repeatedly printed, instructions warning\r\nthe non-combatant civilians not to offer any resistance to the troops\r\nand soldiers invading the country.\r\n\r\nThe information on which the German Government believes today that it\r\ncan base its contention that the Belgian population contravenes the law\r\nof nations and is not worthy of respect is absolutely unfounded.\r\n\r\nThe Government protests most vigorously against these allegations and\r\nagainst the odious threats of retaliation. If any deed contrary to the\r\nrules of warfare should ultimately be proved, to understand such fact it\r\nis only necessary to realize the well-founded excitement which the\r\ncruelties of the German soldiers are provoking among the Belgian\r\npopulation--a population which is thoroughly honest but energetic in the\r\ndefense of its rights and in its respect for humanity.\r\n\r\nIf we were to publish a list of these atrocities, of which the first\r\nones are here recorded, this would indeed be a long list.\r\n\r\nWhole regions have been ravaged and abominable deeds perpetrated in the\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nA committee attached to the Department of Justice is drawing up a list\r\nof these horrors with scrupulous impartiality.\r\n\r\nAs an example, a few facts are here published, facts which will depict\r\nthe state of mind and the procedure of certain German troops:\r\n\r\n     1. German cavalry, occupying the village of Linsmeau, were attacked\r\n     by some Belgian infantry and two gendarmes. A German officer was\r\n     killed by our troops during the fight, and subsequently buried at\r\n     the request of the Belgian officer in command. None of the civilian\r\n     population took part in the fighting at Linsmeau. Nevertheless the\r\n     village was invaded at dusk Aug. 10 by a strong force of German\r\n     cavalry, artillery and machine guns. In spite of formal assurances\r\n     given by the Burgomaster that none of the peasants had taken part\r\n     in the previous fighting, two farms and six outlying houses were\r\n     destroyed by gun fire and burned. All the male population were\r\n     then compelled to come forward and hand over whatever arms they\r\n     possessed. No recently discharged firearms were found. Nevertheless\r\n     the invaders divided these peasants into three groups. Those in one\r\n     group were bound and eleven of them placed in a ditch, where they\r\n     were afterward found dead, their skulls fractured by the butts of\r\n     German rifles.\r\n\r\n     2. During the night of Aug. 10 German cavalry entered Velm in great\r\n     numbers; the inhabitants were asleep. The Germans without\r\n     provocation fired on Mr. Deglimme-Gever's house, broke into it,\r\n     destroyed furniture, looted money, burned barns, hay, corn stacks,\r\n     farm implements, six oxen, and the contents of the farm-yard. They\r\n     carried off Mme. Deglimme half-naked to a place two miles away. She\r\n     was then let go and fired upon as she fled; without being hit. Her\r\n     husband was carried away in another direction and fired upon; he is\r\n     dying. The same troops sacked and burned the house of a railway\r\n     watchman.\r\n\r\n     3. Farmer Jef Dierchx of Neerhespen bears witness to the following\r\n     acts of cruelty committed by German cavalry at Orsmael and\r\n     Neerhespen on Aug. 10, 11, and 12. An old man of the latter village\r\n     had his arm sliced in three longitudinal cuts; he was then hanged\r\n     head downward and burned alive. Young girls have been raped and\r\n     little children outraged at Orsmael, where several inhabitants\r\n     suffered mutilations too horrible to describe. A Belgian soldier\r\n     belonging to a battalion of cyclist carbineers, who had been\r\n     wounded and made prisoner, was bound to a telegraph pole on the St.\r\n     Trond road and shot.\r\n\r\n     4. On Wednesday, Aug. 12, after an engagement at Haelen, Commandant\r\n     Van Damme, so severely wounded that he was lying on his back, was\r\n     finally murdered by German infantrymen firing their revolvers into\r\n     his mouth.\r\n\r\n     5. On Monday, Aug. 9, at Orsmael the Germans picked up Commandant\r\n     Knappen very seriously wounded, propped him against a tree and shot\r\n     him. Finally they hacked his corpse with swords.\r\n\r\n     6. Numerous soldiers, disarmed and unable to defend themselves,\r\n     have been ill-treated or killed by certain German soldiers. The\r\n     inquiry brings forth new facts of this kind every day.\r\n\r\n     7. In different places, notably at Hellonge-sur-Geer, at Barchon,\r\n     at Pontisse, at Haelen, at Zelk, German troops have fired on\r\n     doctors, nurses, ambulances, and ambulance wagons.\r\n\r\n     8. At Boncelles a body of German troops went into a battle carrying\r\n     a Belgian flag.\r\n\r\n     9. On Thursday, Aug. 6, before a fort at Liége, German soldiers\r\n     continued to fire on a party of Belgian soldiers, who were unarmed\r\n     and had been surrounded while digging a trench, after these had\r\n     hoisted the white flag.\r\n\r\n     10. On Thursday, Aug. 10, at Vootem, near the Fort of Loncin, a\r\n     group of German infantry hoisted the white flag. When Belgian\r\n     soldiers approached to take them prisoners the Germans suddenly\r\n     opened fire on them at close range.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nReport on Aerschot.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntwerp, Aug. 28, 1914.\r\n\r\nThe commission of inquiry on violation of the laws of nations and the\r\nlaws and customs of warfare, after an impartial and careful\r\ninvestigation, can make the following report of its findings:\r\n\r\nIt appears from precise and concurring testimony that in the entire\r\nregion of Aerschot the Germans have committed veritable atrocities. The\r\nmajority of the population fled in terror. On their passage the German\r\ntroops set fire to farms and houses and furniture, shooting inoffensive\r\ncitizens whom they found along the road or who were working in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nAt Hersselt, north of Aerschot, thirty-two houses of the village were\r\nset on fire; the miller and his son, who fled, and about twenty-one\r\nother persons were killed; and all this while no Belgian troops were\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nThe German troops penetrated into Aerschot, a town of 8,000 inhabitants,\r\non Wednesday, Aug. 19, in the morning. No Belgian forces remained\r\nbehind. No sooner did the Germans enter the town than they shot five or\r\nsix inhabitants whom they caused to leave their houses. In the evening,\r\npretending that a superior German officer had been killed on the Grand\r\nPlace by the son of the Burgomaster, or, according to another version of\r\nthe story, that a conspiracy had been hatched against the superior\r\ncommandant by the Burgomaster and his family, the Germans took every man\r\nwho was inside of Aerschot; they led them, fifty at a time, some\r\ndistance from the town, grouped them in lines of four men, and, making\r\nthem run ahead of them, shot them and killed them afterward with their\r\nbayonets. More than forty men were found thus massacred.\r\n\r\nThey gave up the town to be pillaged, taking from private residences all\r\nthey could take, breaking furniture, and forcing safes. The following\r\nday they lined up, three by three, the villagers whom they had arrested\r\nthe day before, taking one man out of each line. These they led to a\r\ndistance of about 100 meters from the town, taking with them the\r\nBurgomaster of the town, Mr. Tielmans, and his son, aged 15½ years, and\r\nhis brother, and shot them.\r\n\r\nLater on they forced the remaining villagers to dig holes to bury their\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nFor three whole days they continued to pillage and set fire to\r\neverything in sight.\r\n\r\nAbout 150 inhabitants of Aerschot are supposed to have been thus\r\nmassacred.\r\n\r\nThe largest part of the city is totally destroyed. Five times the\r\nGermans tried to set fire to the large church, the interior of which has\r\nbeen sacked. The records of the town have been carried away.\r\n\r\nThe ambulance attendants, although wearing the Red Cross badge, were not\r\nrespected. One of them reports that German troops fired upon him while\r\nhe was collecting his wounded, and that they continued to fire even\r\nthough he displayed his Red Cross armband. Moreover, during the entire\r\nday of the 19th, while he was engaged in hospital service, he was\r\nthreatened and ill-used. A German officer, among others, took him by the\r\nhead, thrusting against his forehead the butt of a revolver. A\r\ncollector, wearing the insignia of the Red Cross, was killed in the Rue\r\nde l'Hospital on the evening of Aug. 19 by Germans.\r\n\r\nDeny Any Civilian Attack.\r\n\r\nFrom all the testimony taken it appears that the civil population of\r\nAerschot has in no wise participated in the hostilities, that no shot\r\nwas fired by them; that all the witnesses agree in pointing out the\r\nimprobability of the German version, according to which the\r\nBurgomaster's son, a youth of 15½ years, and of extremely gentle\r\ndisposition, is said to have fired upon a superior German officer during\r\nthe night of Aug. 19. Still more improbable is the version of the\r\nconspiracy organized by the Burgomaster. It is to be remarked that if--a\r\nthing which is not known--a German officer has been hit on the Grand\r\nPlace, it might have happened by a stray bullet, German soldiers being\r\nengaged in shooting in the neighboring streets in order to frighten the\r\npopulace.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Burgomaster, a very quiet man, had repeatedly warned his\r\nfellow-citizens, by means of posters and circulars addressed to every\r\ninhabitant of the town, that in case of invasion they were to abstain\r\nfrom any hostility. These posters were still in evidence when the\r\nGermans entered the city, and they were shown to them.\r\n\r\nThe German troops which were traversing localities situated on this side\r\nof Aerschot indulged in the same horrors. They shot fleeing citizens and\r\nset fire to and sacked private houses, all this without provocation.\r\n\r\nAt Rotselaer, for instance, they set fire to about fifteen houses. A\r\nGerman officer, addressing an inhabitant whose house was afire, wanted\r\nto make him declare, at the point of a pistol, that the fire had been\r\nstarted by the Belgians. When this inhabitant protested, claiming that\r\nthe Belgians had left the town the previous evening, this officer\r\ndeclared that if the Germans had set fire to the town it was due\r\nprobably to the fact that the civilians had fired at them, a fact which\r\nis also denied by all the witnesses.\r\n\r\nThere, too, the German troops pillaged everything they could lay their\r\nhands on during their passage.\r\n\r\nUp to this writing the Commission of Inquiry has been unable to obtain\r\nthe testimony of inhabitants of Diest and Tirlemont, which towns were\r\noccupied by the Germans on the 18th and 19th of August, 1914, and which\r\nare cut off from communication.\r\n\r\nHowever, the inhabitants of Schaffen, a town near Diest, have stated\r\nthat the same abominations were committed in their locality and in the\r\nadjoining communities, Lummen and Molenstede. The whole region has been\r\nlaid waste. German troops, at an hour's distance from Diest, had begun\r\ntheir work of destruction all along the highway from Diest to Beeringen.\r\nTurning upon Diest they set fire to everything they could lay hands\r\non--farms, houses, furniture. Arriving at the village of Schaffen, the\r\nGermans set fire to the town, massacring the few inhabitants who\r\nremained behind, and whom they found in their houses or in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe witness gives the names and addresses of eighteen persons whom he\r\nknows to have been massacred.\r\n\r\nAmong them are:\r\n\r\nThe wife of Francois Luyck, 45 years old, and her 12-year-old daughter,\r\nwho were discovered in a sewer and shot.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Jean Ouyen, 9 years old, who was shot.\r\n\r\nAndre Willem, 23 years old, sexton, who was tied to a tree and burned\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nJoseph Reynders, forty years old, who was killed together with his\r\nnephew, a lad of ten years.\r\n\r\nGustave Lodt, forty years old, and Jean Marken, also aged forty,\r\nprobably buried alive.\r\n\r\nThe witness testifies that he personally proceeded to exhume these two\r\nbodies, and that he afterward buried them in the town cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe village of Rethy, near Turnhout, was the object of devastation and\r\nshooting during the day of Aug. 22 by seventeen cavalrymen who had\r\npenetrated into the village. A young woman of fifteen years was killed\r\nby a bullet.\r\n\r\nStill more horrible crimes, if that were possible, have been committed\r\nby the German troops on account of their defeat at the hands of the\r\nBelgian Army before Malines. The City of Louvain, with its artistic and\r\nscientific riches, has not been spared.\r\n\r\nNew reports will be submitted very shortly.\r\n\r\nGOOREMAN, President,\r\nERNST DE BUNSWYCK,\r\nSecretary of the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nDestruction of Louvain.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntwerp, Aug. 31, 1914\r\n\r\nTo the Minister of Justice:\r\n\r\nSir: The Commission of Inquiry begs to make the following report on the\r\ndeeds of which the City of Louvain and the surrounding localities and\r\nthe vicinity of Malines have been the theatre.\r\n\r\nThe German Army penetrated into Louvain on Wednesday, Aug. 19, after\r\nhaving set fire to the towns through which it had passed.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of their entrance into the City of Louvain the Germans\r\nrequisitioned lodgings and victuals for their troops. They entered every\r\nprivate bank of the city and took over the bank balances. German\r\nsoldiers broke the doors of houses abandoned by their inhabitants,\r\npillaged them and indulged in orgies.\r\n\r\nThe German authorities took hostages--the Mayor of the city, Senator\r\nVander Kelm, the Vice Rector of the Catholic University, the Dean of the\r\ncity; magistrates and Aldermen were also detained. All arms, down to\r\nfencing foils, had been handed over to the town administration and\r\ndeposited by the said authorities in the Church of St. Peter.\r\n\r\nIn a neighboring village, Corbeek-Loo, a young matron, 22 years old,\r\nwhose husband was in the army, was surprised on Wednesday, Aug. 19, with\r\nseveral of her relatives, by a band of German soldiers. The persons who\r\naccompanied her were locked in an abandoned house, while she was taken\r\ninto another house, where she was successively attacked by five\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nIn the same village, on Thursday, Aug. 20, German soldiers were\r\nsearching a house where a young girl of 16 years lived with her parents.\r\nThey carried her into an abandoned house, and while some of them kept\r\nthe father and mother off, others went into the house, the cellar of\r\nwhich was open, and forced the young woman to drink. Afterward they\r\ncarried her out on the lawn in front of the house and attacked her\r\nsuccessively. She continued to resist, and they pierced her breast with\r\ntheir bayonets. Having been abandoned by the soldiers after these\r\nabominable attacks, the girl was carried off by her parents, and the\r\nfollowing day, owing to the gravity of her condition, she was\r\nadministered the last rites of the Church by the priest of the parish\r\nand carried to the hospital at Louvain. At that time her life was in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 24 and 25 Belgian troops, leaving the intrenched camp in\r\nAntwerp, attacked the German Army which was outside of Malines.\r\n\r\nThe German troops were driven back as far as Louvain and Vilvorde.\r\n\r\nPenetrating the towns which had been occupied by the enemy, the Belgian\r\nArmy found the whole country devastated. The Germans, while retiring,\r\nhad ravaged and set fire to the villages, taking with them all the male\r\ninhabitants, driving them before them.\r\n\r\nOld Woman Killed by Bayonets.\r\n\r\nUpon entering Hofstade, on Aug. 25, the Belgian soldiers found there the\r\ncorpse of an old woman who had been killed by bayonet thrusts; she still\r\nheld in her hands the needle with which she was sewing when she was\r\nattacked; one mother and her son, aged about 15 or 16 years, lay there,\r\npierced with bayonet wounds; one man was found hanging.\r\n\r\nIn Sempst, a neighboring village, were found the corpses of two men\r\npartially burned. One of them was found with his legs cut off at the\r\nknees, the other was minus his arms and legs. A workman (whose charred\r\nbody several witnesses have seen) had been pierced with bayonets, and\r\nafterward, while still living, the Germans soaked him with petroleum and\r\nlocked him in a house, which they set on fire. An old man and his son\r\nhad been killed by bullets; a woman coming out of her house had been\r\nstricken down in the same manner.\r\n\r\nA witness whose declaration has been received by Edward Hertslet, son of\r\nSir Cecil Hertslet, Consul General of Great Britain in Antwerp,\r\ntestifies to have seen not far from Malines on Aug. 26 (that is, during\r\nthe last attack of the Belgian troops) an old man attached by the arms\r\nto a beam of a barn. The body was completely burned; the head, the arms,\r\nand the feet were intact. Further on was a body all over stabbed with\r\nbayonet thrusts. Numerous corpses of peasants were found in positions of\r\nsupplication, arms lifted and hands folded in prayer. The Belgian Consul\r\nto Unganda, who had entered the Belgian Army as a volunteer, reports\r\nthat everywhere the Germans had passed through the country was\r\ndevastated. The few inhabitants who remained in the villages told of\r\nhorrors committed by the enemy. Thus in Wacherzeel seven Germans are\r\nsaid to have consecutively attacked a woman, afterward killing her. In\r\nthe same village they had stripped a young boy, threatening him with\r\ndeath by pointing a revolver at his breast, piercing him with their\r\nlances, and chasing him into the open fields and shooting after him,\r\nwithout, however, hitting him.\r\n\r\nEverywhere there was ruin and devastation. At Bulcken numerous\r\ninhabitants, including the priest, a man more than 80 years old, were\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nBetween Impde and Wolverthem two wounded Belgian soldiers were lying\r\nnear a house which was burning. The Germans threw these two unfortunate\r\nmen into the raging fire.\r\n\r\nThe German troops repulsed by our soldiers entered Louvain in full\r\npanic. Various witnesses assure us that at that moment the German\r\ngarrison occupying Louvain was advised erroneously that the enemy was\r\nentering the town. Immediately the German garrison withdrew toward the\r\nstation, where it met with the German troops that had been repulsed and\r\npursued by the Belgian troops. Everything seems to indicate that a\r\ncollision took place between the two German regiments. From that moment,\r\nunder pretext that the Louvain civilians had fired upon them, a fact\r\nwhich is contradicted by all witnesses, and which would hardly have been\r\npossible inasmuch as all the inhabitants of Louvain, for several days\r\npast, had been obliged to hand their arms over to the local\r\nauthorities, the German soldiers began to bombard the city. Moreover,\r\nnot one of the witnesses has seen the body of a single civilian at the\r\nplace where the affray happened. The bombarding lasted until 10 o'clock\r\nat night. Afterward the Germans set fire to the city.\r\n\r\nBurning of the Town.\r\n\r\nThe houses which had not taken fire were entered by German soldiers, who\r\nthrew fire grenades, which seem to have been provided for the occasion.\r\nThe largest part of the City of Louvain, especially the quarters of the\r\nVille Haute, comprising the modern houses, the Cathedral of St. Peter,\r\nthe University Halls, with the whole library of the university, its\r\nmanuscripts, its collections, the largest part of the scientific\r\ninstitutions, and the town theatres, were at the moment being consumed\r\nby flames.\r\n\r\nThe commission deems it necessary, in the midst of these horrors, to\r\ninsist on the crime of lèse humanity which the deliberate annihilation\r\nof an academic library--a library which was one of the treasures of our\r\ntime--constitutes.\r\n\r\nNumerous corpses of civilians covered the street and squares. On the\r\nroute from Louvain to Tirlemont alone one witness testifies having seen\r\nmore than fifty of them. On the threshholds of houses were found burned\r\ncorpses of people who, surprised in their cellars by the fire, had tried\r\nto escape and fell into the heap of live embers. The suburbs of Louvain\r\nhave been completely annihilated.\r\n\r\nA group of seventy-five persons, among whom were several notables of the\r\ncity, such as Father Coloboet and a Spanish priest, and also an American\r\npriest, were conducted during the morning of Wednesday, Aug. 26, to the\r\nsquare in front of the station. The men were brutally separated from\r\ntheir wives and children, and after having received the most abominable\r\ntreatment, and after repeated threats of being shot, they were driven in\r\nfront of the German troops as far as the village of Campenhout. They\r\nwere locked in the church during the night. The following day at 4\r\no'clock a German officer came to inform them that they might all confess\r\nthemselves, and that they would be shot half an hour later. But at 4:30\r\no'clock they were allowed to go, and shortly afterward they were again\r\narrested by a German brigade, which forced them to march in front of\r\nthem to Malines. Answering a question on the part of one of the\r\nprisoners, a German officer told them that they were going to taste some\r\nof the Belgian grapeshot before Antwerp. At last they were liberated on\r\nThursday afternoon at the entrance of Malines.\r\n\r\nFurther testimony shows that several thousand male inhabitants of\r\nLouvain who had escaped the shooting and burning were sent toward\r\nGermany. We do not at this writing know for what purpose.\r\n\r\nThe fire continued for several days. An eye-witness, who on Aug. 30 left\r\nLouvain, describes the state of the city as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"From Weert St. Georges,\" he says, \"I have seen nothing except\r\n     burned towns and crazed villagers lifting to each comer their arms\r\n     as a mark of submission. From each house was hanging a white flag,\r\n     even from those that had been set on fire, and rags of them were\r\n     found hanging from the ruins.\r\n\r\n     At Weert St. Georges I inquired from the inhabitants the cause of\r\n     the German reprisals. They all assured me that absolutely none of\r\n     the inhabitants had fired; that all arms had been previously given\r\n     up, and that the Germans had taken vengeance on the population\r\n     because a Belgian soldier of the Gendarme Corps had killed a Uhlan.\r\n\r\n     The population which remained in Louvain took refuge in the suburb\r\n     of Heverle, where they are all piled up, the population having been\r\n     driven from the town by the troops and by the fire.\r\n\r\n     The fire in Louvain began a little above the American College, and\r\n     the city is entirely destroyed, with the exception of the Town Hall\r\n     (Hôtel de Ville) and the depot. Today the fire continued, and the\r\n     Germans--far from trying to stop it--seem rather to maintain it by\r\n     throwing straw into the fire, as I have myself seen in the streets\r\n     behind the Hôtel de Ville. The cathedral and the theatres have been\r\n     destroyed and have fallen in, also the library. The town resembles\r\n     an old city in ruins, in the midst of which drunken soldiers are\r\n     circulating, carrying bottles of wine and liquor; the officers\r\n     themselves being installed in armchairs, sitting around tables and\r\n     drinking like their own men.\r\n\r\n     In the streets dead horses are decaying, horses which are already\r\n     inflated, and the smell of the fire and of the decaying animals is\r\n     such that it has followed me for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nThe commission up to this writing has been unable to obtain any\r\ninformation regarding the fate of the Burgomaster of Louvain, nor\r\nregarding the prominent persons taken for hostages.\r\n\r\nConclusions of the Commission.\r\n\r\nBy facts which have thus far been brought to its attention, the\r\ncommission reaches the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n     In this war, German occupation of territory is systematically\r\n     followed by (and is at times preceded by and accompanied by) acts\r\n     of violence against the civil population, which acts of violence\r\n     are contrary to the conventional laws of war and to the most\r\n     elementary principles of humanity.\r\n\r\n     The procedure of the Germans is everywhere the same. They advance\r\n     along the roads, shooting inoffensive passersby, particularly\r\n     cyclists and even peasants occupied in the fields which the Germans\r\n     traverse.\r\n\r\n     In the towns and villages where they stop, the Germans first of all\r\n     requisition victuals and drinks which they consume to the point of\r\n     drunkenness; then they begin to shoot wildly, sometimes from the\r\n     interior of empty houses, declaring that the inhabitants have fired\r\n     the shots. It is then that the firing scenes begin, and murder and\r\n     especially pillage accompanied by acts of cold cruelty set in, acts\r\n     which respect neither sex nor age. Even where they claim to know\r\n     the perpetrator of the deeds which they allege, they do not content\r\n     themselves with executing the culprits summarily, but take\r\n     advantage of the occasions to decimate the population, to pillage\r\n     all the inhabitants, and to set fire to them.\r\n\r\n     After a first massacre, somewhat at random, they shut the men into\r\n     the church of the town and order all women to go back to the houses\r\n     and leave the doors open during the night.\r\n\r\n     In several localities the civil population has been sent to\r\n     Germany, to be compelled there, it appears, to labor in the fields,\r\n     as was done in the slave days of olden times. Numerous cases are\r\n     known where the inhabitants were forced to serve as guides and to\r\n     make trenches for the Germans. Numerous depositions reveal that in\r\n     their march, and even in their attacks, the Germans put before them\r\n     civilians, men and women, in order to prevent our soldiers from\r\n     firing. Other testimony proves that German detachments do not\r\n     hesitate to fly either a white flag or a Red Cross flag, so as to\r\n     approach our troops without being suspected. On the other hand they\r\n     fire on our ambulances and ill-treat our ambulance nurses. They\r\n     ill-treat and even kill our wounded. Clergymen seem to be\r\n     particularly the object of their attacks. Last, but not least, we\r\n     have in our possession explosive bullets left behind them by the\r\n     enemy at Wechter, and we are also in receipt of medical\r\n     certificates testifying that the wounds must have been inflicted by\r\n     bullets of the variety mentioned above.\r\n\r\n     Documents and testimonials in support of these facts will be\r\n     published.\r\n\r\n     (Signed)\r\n\r\n          GOOREMAN, President.\r\n          COUNT GOBLET D'ALVIELLA.\r\n\r\n     ERNST DE BUNSWYCK,\r\n     ORTS, Secretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER REPORTS.\r\n\r\nCabled to Royal Commission at Washington from Belgian Foreign Office.\r\nCablegram Received Sept. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have received the reports of the commission of Aug. 25 and 31.\r\nSince then a great many localities, situated in the Vilvorde-Malines-\r\nLouvain triangle, an extremely fertile and densely populated district,\r\nhave been partially pillaged and totally destroyed by fire. Their\r\ninhabitants have fled, while a number of them, among others women and\r\nchildren, were arrested and shot without trial, and without apparent\r\nreason, except to inspire the population with terror. This was done in\r\nSempst, Weerde, Elewyt, Hofstade, Wespelaer, Wilsele, Bucken, Eppeghem,\r\nHouthem, Tremeloo, Tistelt, Gelrode, Herent. At Wavre, where the\r\npopulation was unable to pay a levy of 3,000,000 francs, fifty-six\r\nhouses were set on fire. The largest part of Cortenberg is burned. To\r\nexcuse these attacks the Germans allege that an army of civilians\r\nresisted them. According to trustworthy testimony, no provocation can\r\nbe proved at Vise, Aerschot, Louvain, Wavre, and in other localities\r\nsituated in the Malines-Louvain-Vilvorde district, where fire was set\r\nand massacres committed several days after the German occupation.\r\n\r\nCablegram Received Sept. 15.\r\n\r\nInform the Belgian Commission that the Belgian Committee on Inquiry\r\ncontinues to report ruins and devastations and pillage, systematically\r\norganized by German troops in the towns invested by them. The City of\r\nTermonde was destroyed without any hostile participation on the part of\r\nthe civilian population. Out of 1,400 houses, only 295 remain standing,\r\nothers were destroyed by fire and razed from the ground, after the\r\nGermans entered the city. Several civilians were imprisoned and executed\r\nwith bayonets in the presence of their relatives and fellow-citizens. In\r\nMelle nine civilians were killed and forty-five properties destroyed,\r\nwithout any reason.\r\n\r\nThe re-occupation of Aerschot by the Belgian Army reveals disastrous\r\ndeeds. Dwellings, which were not destroyed by fire were completely\r\nsacked and pillaged on Sept. 6 before the return of the Belgian troops.\r\nFour hundred civilians, among them thirty clergymen, were locked since\r\nAug. 30 in the church without food, carried off, and sent to\r\ndestinations unknown. Localities in the neighborhood are completely\r\ndestroyed, and everywhere along the road are corpses. Women and young\r\ngirls were outraged. Systematic pillage.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPublished by Belgian Commission of Inquiry on Sept. 10 to Complete Its\r\nReport of Aug. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the two reports, dated August 28 and 31, which the Commission has had\r\nthe honor of addressing to you, the former recounted more particularly\r\nthe events which occurred at Aerschot and in the neighboring district,\r\nwhile the latter dealt with the destruction of the town of Louvain by\r\nthe German troops. In order to complete its report of Aug. 31, the\r\nCommission thinks it its duty to record that after the burning of\r\nLouvain the houses which remained standing, the inhabitants of which had\r\nbeen forced to flee, were pillaged under the eyes of German officers. On\r\nSept. 2 the Germans were seen setting fire to four houses.\r\n\r\nThe \"Chastisement\" of Louvain.\r\n\r\nAnother fact which emphasizes the ruthless character of the treatment to\r\nwhich the peaceable population of Louvain was subjected has also been\r\nestablished. On Aug. 28 a crowd of 6,000 to 8,000 persons, men, women\r\nand children, of every age and condition, was conducted under the escort\r\nof a detachment of the 162nd Regiment of German infantry to the riding\r\nschool of the town, where they spent the whole night. The place of\r\nconfinement was so small in proportion to the number of the occupants\r\nthat all had to remain standing, and so great were their sufferings that\r\nin the course of this tragic night several women lost their reason and\r\nchildren of tender years died in their mothers' arms.\r\n\r\nA communiqué from the German Great General Staff, the text of which is\r\npublished in the Cologne Gazette of Aug. 29, declares that the\r\n\"chastisement\" inflicted upon Louvain was justified by the fact that a\r\nbattalion of Landwehr, which had been left unsupported in the town in\r\norder to guard the communications, had been attacked by the civil\r\npopulation, which was under the impression that the main German Army had\r\ndefinitely retired. The same journal has published a narrative\r\npurporting to come from a person who was a witness of the occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry has established that this statement must be considered\r\nfalse. It is, in fact, ascertained that the people of Louvain, who,\r\nmoreover, had been disarmed by the Communal Authority, did not provoke\r\nthe Germans by any act of hostility.\r\n\r\nThe commission has resumed the inquiry begun at Brussels on the subject\r\nof the occurrences at Visé.\r\n\r\nThis place was the first Belgian town destroyed in pursuance of the\r\nsystem applied subsequently by the invader to so many other of our\r\ncities and villages. It is for this reason that we have been careful to\r\ndetermine what truth there is in the German version according to which\r\nthe civilian population of Visé took part in the defense of the town or\r\nrose against the Germans after the town had been occupied.\r\n\r\nSeveral witnesses now at Antwerp have been heard, notably soldiers\r\nbelonging to the detachment which disputed with the Germans the passage\r\nof the Meuse, north of Liége, and a lady of German nationality, who\r\nbelongs to the religious community of the Sisters of Notre Dame at Visé.\r\n\r\nInnocent Vise.\r\n\r\nThe result is to prove that the inhabitants took no part whatever in the\r\nfighting which took place on Aug. 4 at the ford of Lixhe and at Visé\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was only in the night of Aug. 15-16 that the destruction of\r\nthe town began, the signal being given by several shots fired on the\r\nevening of the 15th. The Germans asserted that the inhabitants had fired\r\nupon them, particularly from a house the owner of which gave evidence\r\nbefore the commission.\r\n\r\nThe Germans discovered no arms in this house, any more than they did in\r\nneighboring buildings, which, nevertheless, were burned after being\r\npillaged, and the male occupants of which were carried off to Germany.\r\n\r\nThe evidence has brought to light the improbability of any rising among\r\na disarmed population against a numerous German garrison at a time when\r\nthe last Belgian troops had for eleven days evacuated the district, and\r\nthe witnesses have declared that the first shots were fired by\r\nintoxicated German infantry soldiers at their own officers. This fact\r\nappears not to be exceptional. It is, indeed, notorious that at\r\nMaestricht, either by mistake or in consequence of a mutiny, Germans\r\nabout this same time killed one another during the night at a cavalry\r\ncamp which they had established at Mesch, close to the Dutch frontier in\r\nLimbourg.\r\n\r\nIt is confirmed that the town of Visé was entirely burned, with the\r\nexception, it appears, of a religious establishment which seems to have\r\nbeen respected, and that several citizens, both of the town and of the\r\nvillage of Canne, were shot.\r\n\r\nA Deliberate System.\r\n\r\nA large number of places situated in the triangle between Vilvorde,\r\nMalines, and Louvain--that is to say, in one of the most populous and, a\r\nfew days ago, one of the most prosperous regions in Belgium--have been\r\ngiven over to plunder, partially or entirely destroyed by fire, their\r\npopulation dispersed, while the inhabitants were indiscriminately\r\narrested and shot without trial and without apparent reason, the sole\r\nobject being, it seems, to inspire terror and to compel the migration of\r\nthe population.\r\n\r\nThis was notably the case in the communes or hamlets of Sempst, Weerde,\r\nElewyt, Holstade, Wespelaer, Wilsele, Bueken, Eppeghem, Wackerzeele,\r\nRotselaer, Werchter, Thildonck, Boortmeerbeek, Houthem, Tremeloo. In\r\nthis last village only the church and the presbytery remained standing.\r\nOn the few houses which have been spared may be seen the following\r\ninscriptions: \"Nicht abbrennen,\" (do not burn,) \"Bitte schonen,\"\r\n(please spare,) \"Gute leute, nicht plundren,\" (good people, do not\r\nplunder.) These houses, however, were sacked afterward.\r\n\r\nIn all these villages the women who have been unable to escape are\r\nexposed to the brutal instincts of the German soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe district immediately adjoins that of Aerschot, the devastation of\r\nwhich was described in an earlier report. It extends at present to the\r\nnorthwest of Brussels, where the important towns of Grimberghen and\r\nWolverthem have been sacked, while southeast of the capital, more than\r\ntwenty-five kilometers from the scene of military operations, the town\r\nof Wavre, which was unable to furnish the exorbitant war levy of\r\n3,000,000 francs (£120,000) imposed by the General Staff of the enemy,\r\nhas seen fifty-six of its houses destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nWe must also record that on Sept. 4 and 5 bombs were hurled from an\r\naeroplane upon Ghent and Escloo, which are open and undefended towns.\r\n\r\nFinally, you are aware, M. le Ministre, that the town of Malines, after\r\nit had been completely evacuated by Belgian troops on Aug. 27, was\r\nsubjected for several days to a bombardment which has seriously damaged\r\nthe cathedral church of St. Rombaut, the pride of this ancient city. The\r\ntown of Heyst-opden-Berg was also bombarded without mercy, though there\r\nwas no strategic interest to warrant such an act.\r\n\r\nThe Plea of Armed Resistance.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, in order to excuse their violence, declare that, wherever\r\nthey have shot civilians or burned and pillaged towns and villages,\r\narmed resistance has been offered by the inhabitants. While there may\r\npossibly have been isolated instances of this kind, that is nothing more\r\nthan occurs in all wars, and if they had confined themselves to\r\nexecuting the guilty persons we could only have bowed before the rigor\r\nof military law. But in no case could individual and absolutely\r\nexceptional acts of aggression justify the wholesale measures of\r\nrepression which have been adopted against the persons and the property\r\nof the inhabitants of our towns and villages--the shooting, the burning,\r\nthe pillaging which has proceeded pretty well everywhere in our country,\r\nnot only by way of reprisals but with a refinement of cruelty. Moreover,\r\nno provocation has been proved at Visé, Marsage, Louvain, Wavre,\r\nTermonde, and other places which have been entirely and deliberately\r\ndestroyed several days after being occupied, not to mention the\r\nsystematic burning of isolated buildings situated in the line of march\r\nof the troops, and the shooting of the unfortunate inhabitants who fled.\r\n\r\nThe Germans have asserted in their newspapers that the Belgian\r\nGovernment distributed to the civil population arms which were to be\r\nused against the invaders. They add that the Catholic clergy preached a\r\nsort of holy war and incited their flock everywhere to massacre the\r\nGermans. Finally, they have declared, in order to justify the massacres\r\nof women, that women showed themselves as ferocious as the men, and went\r\nso far as to pour boiling oil from their windows upon the troops on the\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nA Tissue of Falsehoods.\r\n\r\nAll these allegations are so many falsehoods. Far from having\r\ndistributed arms, the authorities everywhere on the approach of the\r\nenemy disarmed the inhabitants. The Burgomasters everywhere warned the\r\ntownspeople against acts of violence, which would involve reprisals. The\r\nclergy have unceasingly preached calm to their flock. As for the women,\r\nif we except a story in a foreign newspaper, the source of which is\r\nsuspected, everything shows that their only anxiety was to escape the\r\nhorrors of a ruthless war.\r\n\r\nThe true motives for the atrocities the moving evidence of which we have\r\ngathered can only be, on the one hand, the desire to terrorize and\r\ndemoralize the people in accordance with the inhuman theories of German\r\nmilitary writers, and, on the other hand, the desire for plunder. A\r\nshot fired, no one knows where, or by whom, or against whom, by a\r\ndrunken soldier, or an excited sentry, is enough to furnish a pretext\r\nfor the sack of a whole city. Individual plunder is succeeded by war\r\nlevies of a magnitude which it is impossible to satisfy and by the\r\ntaking of hostages who will be shot or kept in confinement until payment\r\nof the ransom in full, according to the well-known procedure of classic\r\nbrigandage. It must also be stated that in order to establish the German\r\ncase all resistance offered by detachments of the regular army is laid\r\nto the account of the civilian population, and that the invader\r\ninvariably avenges himself upon the civilians for the checks or even the\r\ndisappointments which he suffers in the course of the campaign.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this inquiry we use only facts supported by trustworthy\r\nevidence. It should be noted that up to the present we have been able to\r\nrecord only a small part of the crimes committed against law, humanity,\r\nand civilization, which will constitute one of the most sinister and\r\nmost revolting pages in contemporary history. If an international\r\ninquiry, like that which was conducted in the Balkans by the Carnegie\r\nCommission, could be conducted in our country, we are convinced that it\r\nwould establish the truth of our assertions.\r\n\r\n[Signed by M.

Thinking that\r\nthis meant the retreat of the German troops, priests at Louvain gave\r\narms and ammunition to the civilians, who began, at different places,\r\nsuddenly to shoot out of windows at unsuspecting German troops, of whom\r\nmany were wounded. A fight of twenty-five hours between German soldiers\r\nand the civil population of Louvain took place. Parts of Louvain were\r\nburning. Civilians met with arms are killed. The manifesto of the Chief\r\nGeneral speaks of bestial cruelties committed on wounded and makes the\r\nmagistrates responsible for the provocation and for providing people\r\nwith arms.\r\n\r\nThe German Army protests against the news spread out by enemies about\r\nthe cruelty of German warfare. The German troops had to take severe\r\nmeasures sometimes when provoked, the population making treacherous\r\nattacks upon them and bestial atrocities against the wounded. The\r\nresponsibility for the recourse of warfare falls entirely upon the\r\nauthorities of the occupied territories who gave arms to the civil\r\npopulation and stirred them up to take part in the war wherever the\r\npopulation was not hostile. The German troops never did harm people or\r\nproperty. The German soldier is not an incendiary nor pillager. He only\r\nfights against a hostile army. The news published in foreign papers\r\nabout the Germans chasing the population means the characterizing\r\nimmorality of the authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial Communication of the German General Staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERLIN, Aug. 30, 1914.\r\n\r\nThe City of Loewen (Louvain) had surrendered and was given over to us by\r\nthe Belgian authorities. On Monday, Aug. 24, some of our troops were\r\nshipped there and intercourse with the inhabitants was developing in a\r\nquite friendly manner.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Aug. 25, our troops, hearing about an imminent\r\nBelgian sortie from Antwerp, left in that direction, the Commanding\r\nGeneral ahead in a motor car, leaving behind only a Colonel with\r\nsoldiers to protect railroad, (landsturm battalion \"neuss.\")\r\n\r\nAs the rest of the Commanding General's staff, with the horses, was\r\ngoing to follow, and collected on the market place, suddenly rifle fire\r\nopened from all the surrounding houses, all the horses being killed and\r\nfive officers wounded, one of them seriously.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously fire opened at about ten different places in town, also\r\non some of our troops, just arrived and waiting on the square in front\r\nof the station, and on incoming military trains. A designed co-operation\r\nwith the Belgian sortie from Antwerp established beyond doubt. Two\r\npriests caught in handing out ammunition to the people were shot at once\r\nin front of the station.\r\n\r\nStreet fights lasted till Wednesday, the 26th, in the afternoon,\r\n(twenty-four hours,) when stronger forces, arrived in the meantime,\r\nsucceeded in getting the upper hand. Town and northern suburbs were\r\nburning at different places and by this time have probably burned down\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the Belgian Government a general rising of the population\r\nagainst the enemy had been organized for a long time; depots of arms\r\nwere found where to each gun was attached the name of the citizen to be\r\narmed.\r\n\r\nA spontaneous rising of the people has been recognized, at the request\r\nof the smaller States at The Hague Conference, as being within the law\r\nof nations as far as weapons are carried openly and the laws of\r\ncivilized warfare are being observed; but such rising was only admitted\r\nin order to fight the attacking.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Loewen the town had already surrendered and the\r\npopulation renounced, without any resistance, the town being occupied\r\nby our troops. Nevertheless the population attacked on all sides and\r\nwith a murderous fire the occupying forces and newly arriving troops,\r\nwhich came in trains and automobiles, considering the hitherto peaceful\r\nattitude of the population.\r\n\r\nTherefore there can be no question of means of defense allowed by the\r\nlaw of nations, neither of a warlike guet-apens, (ambush,) but only of a\r\ntreacherous attempt of the civil population all along the line, and all\r\nthe more to be condemned as it was apparently planned long beforehand\r\nwith simultaneous attack from Antwerp, as arms were not carried openly,\r\nas women and young girls took part in the fight and blinded our wounded,\r\nsticking their eyes out.\r\n\r\nThe barbarous attitude of the Belgian population in all parts occupied\r\nby our troops has not only justified our severest measures, but forced\r\nthem on us for the sake of self-preservation. The intensity of the\r\nresistance of the population is shown by the fact that in Loewen\r\ntwenty-four hours were needed to break down their attack.\r\n\r\nWe ourselves regret deeply that during these fights the town of Loewen\r\nhas been destroyed to a great extent. Needless to say that these\r\nconsequences are not intentional on our part, but cannot be avoided in\r\nthis infamous franc-tireur war being led against us.\r\n\r\nWhoever knows the good-natured character of our troops cannot seriously\r\npretend that they are inclined to needless or frivolous destruction.\r\n\r\nThe entire responsibility for these events rests with the Belgian\r\nGovernment, who with criminal frivolity have given to the Belgian people\r\ninstructions contrary to law of nations and incited the resistance, and\r\nwho, in spite of our repeated warnings, even after the fall of Luettich,\r\n(Liége,) have done nothing to induce them to a peaceful attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial German Statement Published in Berlin, Sept. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelgium is officially spreading false representations about the\r\noccurrences through which the City of Louvain was made to suffer. It is\r\nclaimed that German troops, having been repulsed by Belgians making a\r\nsortie from Antwerp, were fired upon by mistake by the German garrison\r\nof Louvain and that in this way fighting occurred there. But events\r\nprove incontestably that the Germans repulsed the Belgian sortie.\r\n\r\nDuring this battle before Antwerp an undoubtedly organized attack was\r\nmade upon the German troops at many places in Louvain, after apparently\r\nfriendly relations between the Germans and the citizens of the town had\r\nseemed for twenty-four hours to be beginning. The attack was at first\r\nagainst a Landwehr battalion composed of older men of quiet disposition\r\nand themselves mostly fathers of families; also against sections of the\r\nGeneral Staff that had remained in the city, and upon moving columns of\r\ntroops. The Germans had many wounded and killed. They won the upper\r\nhand, however, owing to the arrival of fresh troops by rail, who were\r\nfired upon at the station. The truth of the foregoing statements is\r\nestablished beyond all cavil. The City Hall was saved, but further\r\nattempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUVAIN'S ART TREASURES.\r\n\r\nOfficial Report by Superior Confidential Councilor von Falke After\r\nInspection of Louvain, Sept. 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient Tuchhalle, which was used for university and library\r\npurposes, was completely destroyed by fire, with the exception of the\r\nfront and rear facades in Gothic and Renaissance style. The library,\r\nwith its very valuable treasures of manuscripts and books, was therefore\r\na total loss. Officials of the library who might have called attention\r\nto the saving of the imperiled treasures were not present when the\r\nadjoining houses on both sides of the hall caught fire, and no hope\r\nexists that any of the books or manuscripts, or even parts thereof,\r\nmight be found in the ruins.\r\n\r\nApart from this--by far the worst damage--and the partial destruction\r\nby fire of the Cathedral of St. Peter no other losses of extraordinary\r\nimportance took place at Louvain.\r\n\r\nThe Rathaus, or City Hall, in late Gothic style, under reconstruction\r\nfor several years and on which work has not been finished yet, was\r\nsaved, thanks to the orders of the commander, Major von Manteuffel, who\r\nordered that the burning houses on the right side of the City Hall be\r\nleveled to the ground. The military removed from a cellar of the City\r\nHall a quantity of ammunition which threatened to explode through\r\nextreme heat of the fire. Four soldiers were severely injured thereby.\r\nThe Rathaus, thanks to the precautions taken by the German military, and\r\nin spite of its nearness to the conflagration, was not damaged in the\r\ninterior, nor did its rich outer architecture suffer any at all.\r\n\r\nThe roof of the Cathedral of St. Peter, which was set afire by sparks\r\nfrom adjoining buildings, was very considerably damaged, however only to\r\nsuch an extent as to allow its restoration to the original condition.\r\nThe roof frame is burned to the beginning of the curve of the dome. The\r\ninner ceiling has prevented the fire from spreading to the inner part of\r\nthe church, containing rich art treasures. Above the choir, however, the\r\ninner ceiling gave way, thereby partially damaging the upper part of the\r\nrococo altar of stone which was without any particular artistic value.\r\n\r\nThe small sacrament house standing next to the altar--a very fine and\r\nrich stonework of late Gothic style by the builder of the City Hall, M.\r\nde Layens--has been slightly damaged by the collapse of the ceiling,\r\nwhich chipped off the upper phiales. These broken pieces have been\r\ncollected without any substantial loss and can easily be replaced. The\r\ndamage to the sacrament house can therefore be replaced. Close to the\r\nmain portal of the cathedral, following the fire in the bell tower, the\r\nfalling bells pierced the roof. Near the entrance in the southerly part\r\nof the church at the right side the fire did some damage to the walls\r\nand the stone balustrades in the side chapel. Notable art treasures\r\nhave, however, not been damaged. Only the ventilator in the main portal,\r\na beautiful Renaissance carving, (of wood,) was burned. An ancient glass\r\npainting of the seventeenth century remained undamaged.\r\n\r\nThe left side chapel to the north of the entrance, with its Gothic\r\nbronze baptismal and the iron arm in Gothic style, (the cover being\r\nmissing for many years,) with its rococo carved altars and heavy\r\nsideboards, are untouched, as well as the organ of the year 1556 in a\r\nbeautiful carved oak inclosure of the Renaissance period in the\r\nnortherly centre chapel.\r\n\r\nThe paintings in the choir chapels, to which belong the most precious\r\nart treasures of Louvain, such as the works of Dierik Bouts and the\r\nMaster of Flemalle, together with all movable art treasures of St.\r\nPeter's Church, were saved by Lieut. Col. of Reserves Thelemann and\r\ntransferred to a hall in the Rathaus, where they are now under the\r\nsupervision of the Mayor. Here can be found \"The Holy Communion\" by\r\nDierik Bouts, and his \"Martyrdom of the Holy Erasmus,\" the\r\n\"Kreuzabnahme\" (\"Removal from the Cross\") by the Master of Flemalle, and\r\ntwo side paintings representing the donors (apparently by another\r\nartist.) Three paintings by J.v. Rillaerz and several later paintings of\r\nlesser value are stored there.\r\n\r\nThe oaken church treasure chest containing eight silver Holy Virgins,\r\nsome of them from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a Gothic\r\nincense bowl, Gothic Renaissance monstrances of silver, highly artistic\r\nand valuable ciboriums of the eighteenth century, also chandeliers,\r\ncandlesticks, swinging lamps, and other church regalia have been stored\r\nin the City Hall. The report continues that an architect of Louvain has\r\nbeen ordered to temporarily repair the damage of the roof regardless of\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThus of the old art works of the Church of St. Peter only the ventilator\r\nis destroyed; the stone structure of the building itself remains intact.\r\nUntil the framework of the roof is rebuilt a temporary roof should be\r\nconstructed to shelter the interior of the church. A Louvain architect\r\nhas been authorized by the Mayor to do this work.\r\n\r\nThe semi-official Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, after publishing this\r\nreport, says:\r\n\r\n\"The disastrous accidental fire, called forth by the revolt of the\r\npopulace and then spread further through the storm wind, devastated\r\nespecially the rows of houses near the railroad station, in the\r\nBahnhofstrasse and in the centre of the city. The remaining churches lie\r\noutside of the zone touched by the fire, which comprised about one-sixth\r\nthe area of the city; they were therefore not touched by the fire. Thus\r\nthere remained undamaged the Church of St. Michael, the Church of St.\r\nJacob, the Church of St. Gertrude, with all their notable art works;\r\nlikewise the College du Saint Esprit, with its library.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBombardment of Rheims Cathedral\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtest Issued to Neutral Powers from French Foreign Office, Bordeaux,\r\nSept. 21.\r\n\r\nWithout being able to invoke even the appearance of military necessity,\r\nand for the mere pleasure of destruction, German troops have subjected\r\nthe Cathedral of Rheims to a systematic and furious bombardment. At this\r\nhour the famous basilica is but a heap of ruins.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the Government of the republic to denounce to\r\nuniversal indignation this revolting act of vandalism, which, in giving\r\nover to the flames this sanctuary of history, deprives humanity of an\r\nincomparable portion of its historic patrimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPE BENEDICT SILENT.\r\n\r\nAuthorized Dispatch to The London Daily News, Sept. 27.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Pope is greatly shocked and deeply grieved at the\r\ndestruction of the Rheims Cathedral, which he is convinced was entirely\r\nunnecessary, and could easily have been averted, he still declines to\r\nmake a public statement. I am merely authorized to state that the Pope's\r\nsorrow at the destruction of the magnificent cathedral is so great that\r\nit is impossible for him to express it.\r\n\r\nThe Pope is convinced that his sorrow is shared not only by Catholics,\r\nbut by all Christians, since all believers in God mourn the destruction\r\nof His temples, which even war does not justify.\r\n\r\nA member of the Pope's entourage explained the reasons why a public\r\nstatement was not issued. He said:\r\n\r\n     The Pope's sorrow is understood, if not publicly announced. It is\r\n     inconceivable that even if the destruction of the cathedral was\r\n     necessary for strategical reasons the intensity of the Pope's\r\n     sorrow would be lessened, but a public statement implies blame,\r\n     which the Pope thinks now is inopportune and inexpedient, hence he\r\n     refrains from any comment. God's mercy is undoubted; His justice\r\n     inevitable. Time will show whether the criminal destruction of one\r\n     of the most famous of the world's cathedrals will remain\r\n     unpunished.

This is\r\nridiculous. All that I have to say on this matter is that I am positive\r\nthat the attack on the cathedral at Rheims was not willful.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I feel much more for the thousands of men who have\r\nsacrificed their lives, although I regret as much as any man the\r\ndestruction of such a beautiful work of art.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SPARE THE CATHEDRAL.\"\r\n\r\nGerman Government Disclaimer Issued by Count von Bernstorff,\r\nWashington, Sept. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German Government states officially in contradiction of the report\r\nmade by the Havas Agency that German artillery purposely destroyed\r\nimportant buildings at Rheims, that, on the contrary, orders were given\r\nto spare the cathedral by all means.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH ARE BLAMED\r\n\r\nOfficial German Dispatch from Berlin, Received in Amsterdam, Sept. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral of Rheims was not used as a mark for a systematic\r\nbombardment. During the last few days the French had strengthened the\r\nfortress to defend their present position, and consequently the German\r\nbombardment became necessary. Orders had been given to spare the\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\nIf it should prove true that during the fire the cathedral suffered,\r\nwhich cannot be yet ascertained, nobody would deplore it more than\r\nourselves, but the French who made Rheims a fortress in support of their\r\ndefense line are alone to blame.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAMAGE DONE.\r\n\r\nOfficial Report Made by Whitney Warren to the French Government, Sept.\r\n28.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, Sept. 25, I received word from the embassy that the French\r\nGovernment had made arrangements to take me to Rheims in order that I\r\nmight make a report on general conditions and especially upon the\r\ncathedral. So at 8 o'clock the next morning I started off with two\r\nautomobiles under the escort of Capt. Henri Charbonnel, accompanied by\r\ntwo soldiers; one automobile, conducted by Mr. Hall of New York,\r\ncontaining Major Morton Henry, Major Cosby, and Lieut. Boyd of the\r\nembassy.\r\n\r\nWe followed the route direct to Meaux, then to La Ferte-sur-Jouarre,\r\nfrom there to Château-Thierry, where we picked up a third automobile\r\ncontaining Capt. Perrin, with authority from Gen. Joffre to conduct us\r\nanywhere we chose to go, providing it was safe.\r\n\r\nFrom there to Epernay, where we had luncheon, and then to\r\nChalons-sur-Marne, where was stationed the chef d'etat-major. There they\r\ntold us it was possible to go to Rheims, although the bombardment had\r\nbeen rather severe the day before. So we turned northwest and proceeded\r\nto Rheims, passing by Conde-sur-Marne and Verzy. Here we passed many\r\ntroops, who, although fagged, seemed to be in very good condition, and\r\nwe arrived at Rheims at 4:30, proceeding directly to the cathedral,\r\nwhere I remained until dark, talking and visiting the monument with the\r\nCuré Landrieux and the Abbé Thinot, who had been in charge of the\r\ncathedral from the commencement.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was again at the cathedral, from 7:30 in the morning\r\nuntil 4:30 in the afternoon, visiting it in every particular,\r\nendeavoring to realize the damage done, whether intentionally inflicted\r\nor not. The following is as near as I am able to ascertain the different\r\nphases of the bombardment:\r\n\r\nFour Bombs on First Day.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 4, when the Germans first entered Rheims, there was a first\r\nbombardment by their guns, interpreted by the Germans themselves as\r\neither a mistake or caused by the jealousy of some corps not allowed\r\nthat privilege. Four bombs fell upon the cathedral--one on the north\r\ntransept--doing but little damage, however.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 14 and 15, after the Germans had evacuated the city and the\r\nFrench had entered, the bombardment recommenced, but without touching\r\nthe cathedral. On Sept. 17 two bombs struck, one on the apse and the\r\nother on the north transept.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th the cathedral was again hit on the southern flying\r\nbuttresses and on the roof, killing a gendarme and several German\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 19 the cathedral was fairly riddled by bombs during the entire\r\nday, and at about 3:45 the scaffolding surrounding the north tower\r\ncaught fire. This fire lasted about one hour, and during that time two\r\nfurther bombs struck the roof, setting it also on fire. The curé claims\r\nthat one of these bombs must have been incendiary, otherwise it would be\r\nimpossible to explain the extraordinary quickness with which the fire\r\nspread throughout the roof timbers.\r\n\r\nThe fire from the scaffolding descended until it reached the north door\r\nof the main façade, which caught rapidly, burned through and\r\ncommunicated to the straw with which the floor of the cathedral was\r\ncovered. This straw had been ordered on Sept. 12 by the German Commander\r\nin order to prepare the cathedral to receive 3,000 German wounded but\r\nthe evacuation of the city by the Germans had prevented the cathedral\r\nbeing used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen the French came back the straw was gathered together with the\r\nintention of removing it, but on the 17th the French General ordered it\r\nto be re-spread, the flag of the Red Cross hoisted on the north tower\r\nand the German wounded placed there, in the hopes that this might save\r\nthe cathedral.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, on Sept. 19 the straw caught from the fire originating\r\nin the scaffold, burning through the doors and destroying what was known\r\nas the very fine wooden tambours, or vestibules, surrounding these doors\r\non the inside, and also calcinating the extraordinary stone sculptures\r\ndecorating the entire interior of this western wall. These sculptures\r\nwere peculiar to Rheims, being in high, full relief and cut out of the\r\nmass of the stone itself instead of being applied. This is one of the\r\nirreparable destructions occasioned.\r\n\r\nAll the wonderful glass of the nave is absolutely gone; that of the apse\r\nstill exists, though greatly damaged.\r\n\r\nDecorative Motifs Lost.\r\n\r\nThe fire on the outside calcinated the greater part of the façade, the\r\nnorth tower and the entire clerestory, with the flying buttresses and\r\nthe turret crowning each of them. This stone, as far as its surface is\r\nconcerned, is irreparably damaged and when touched detaches itself;\r\nconsequently all decorative motifs wherever the flames reached are lost.\r\n\r\nThe tresor was saved at the commencement of the fire by the priests and\r\nthe tapestries for which Rheims is so greatly renowned had been\r\nfortunately removed before. Half the stalls have been destroyed. The\r\norgan is intact and several crucifixes and pictures in the apse are\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\nThat anything remains of the monument is owing to the strong\r\nconstruction of what might be called the carcass of the cathedral and, I\r\nam firmly convinced, through no desire on the part of the bombarding\r\nforces to spare this monument. The walls and vaults are of a robustness\r\nwhich can resist even modern implements of destruction, for even on\r\nSept. 24, when the bombardment was again taken up, three bombs landed on\r\nthe cathedral, but the vaults resisted absolutely, not even being\r\nperforated.\r\n\r\nHad the Cathedral of Amiens received the same punishment, because of the\r\nlightness of its construction the vaults would undoubtedly have given\r\nway, the flying buttresses would have crushed in the walls and nothing\r\nwould have remained but a mass of crumbled stone, with the exception of\r\nperhaps the ruins of the towers. If anything therefore remains of Rheims\r\nCathedral it is due, as I have already said, to the robustness of its\r\nconstruction and not to any desire on the part of those bombarding it to\r\nspare it from utter destruction.\r\n\r\nThe monument, about which no troops were massed, towers above the rest\r\nof the town; to avoid it, in view of the uselessness of destroying it\r\nand because it was serving as a hospital, would have been an easy\r\nmatter. The entire quarter of the city situated between it and the enemy\r\nis destroyed, including the Episcopal Palace, which contained the\r\nArchaeological Museum, the Episcopal Chapel, and what was known as the\r\n\"Apartment of the Kings.\" This quarter also contained the principal\r\ncommercial houses.\r\n\r\n\"Blind Rage\" Causes Attack.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the only explanation which can be offered was blind\r\nrage upon the part of the besieging army.\r\n\r\nThere are two monuments of almost equal importance to the world which\r\nare in jeopardy of the same fate as the Cathedral of Rheims, viz., the\r\nCathedrals of Noyon and Laon. That these will be respected is to be\r\nhoped, in spite of the ruthless and miserable attempt to reduce the\r\nglorious monuments of Rheims to ruins.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, Sept. 25, the Germans further shelled the Abbey of Rémy at\r\nRheims, one shell exploding in the interior and destroying an immense\r\nquantity of glass. The civil hospital, which occupies the cloisters of\r\nSt. Rémy, received as its quota nine bombs, one of which killed four of\r\nthe patients in the beds, and another one of the attendants. Needless to\r\nsay that over this building also were flying flags of the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, Sept. 27, I spent about two hours on top of the north tower\r\nof the cathedral, behind the parapets, where I could not be seen,\r\nwatching the bombardment of the French forces, which was going on in the\r\nsuburbs of the town, situated at about two kilometers from my point of\r\nvantage. It was most interesting, the precision with which the German\r\nshells arrived in groups of six at intervals of, I should say, three to\r\nfive minutes. The French troops were all wonderfully covered so that\r\nthey could not be seen, their guns being concealed under straw or beet\r\nleaves, according to the character of the ground upon which the battery\r\nwas established.\r\n\r\nNo smoke came from their guns, their powder being absolutely smokeless,\r\nand yet the Germans seemed to have located them very thoroughly and kept\r\nup a continual bombardment, their shells landing repeatedly over the\r\nsame place, seemingly, without any deviation whatever.\r\n\r\nShot Proclaims \"Lights Out.\"\r\n\r\nWe all slept the Saturday and Sunday nights in Rheims, which was in a\r\nstate of siege, all lights being out at 8 o'clock. One of our party\r\nfoolishly left his window open while he had his light on; a pistol shot\r\nfrom the police drew attention to the fact, and the entire electric\r\nlight of the hotel was immediately cut off.\r\n\r\nIn the day time great numbers of the population would leave the city and\r\ngo out in the suburbs on the safe side to watch the combat, returning at\r\nnight to their homes to see what destruction had been occasioned and, if\r\npossible, to get a night's rest. I had a large quantity of tobacco with\r\nme, which was received by the troops and by the civilians with great\r\njoy, for they had seen none for a month, the Germans having taken\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nWhile the commercial part of the city had been absolutely destroyed, in\r\nother parts one would find places where stray shells had fallen, doing\r\ngreat damage. It all seemed absolutely ruthless and useless. The curé of\r\nthe cathedral told me that the Germans during their occupation had\r\nestablished an observation post in the north tower with an electric\r\nsearchlight. This they took away with them, and some of the French\r\nofficers, during the first days of reoccupation, occasionally went up\r\nthere to have a look, but the curé had strongly objected and they had\r\ngiven it up.\r\n\r\nI know that the two days that I was there nobody but myself went into\r\nthe tower and I did so unbeknown to the authorities, being very careful\r\nnot to show myself, as I was assured it would draw fire if the Germans\r\nsaw anybody moving about on it. I think, myself, that this is an\r\nexaggeration, as their line of observation must be at least seven or\r\neight miles removed and at that distance, even with a very strong glass,\r\nit would be almost impossible to distinguish a human silhouette.\r\n\r\nWe left Rheims at 7 o'clock on Monday morning, proceeding to\r\nVillers-Cotterets and stopping at Lafere-en-Tardenois, which was the\r\nheadquarters of the English. Here there were great quantities of\r\nautomobiles and considerable commotion that it was his honest opinion\r\nthat this was not the case. The village had been bombarded before the\r\narrival of the Germans, and the Mayor had taken refuge in the cellar of\r\nthe Mairie. When the Germans arrived at about 3 o'clock they dragged him\r\nout and took him to a little place about three kilometers from Senlis,\r\nwhere he is supposed to have been questioned, together with other\r\nhostages. At 10 o'clock that night he was shot and buried where he fell.\r\n\r\nThe next day seven other hostages were shot in view of the fact that\r\nsome civilians were accused of having fired upon the military. Three\r\ndays after this the Acting Mayor and a party of citizens recovered the\r\nbody of the Mayor, who had been buried under a very thin covering of\r\nearth in a very shallow grave--so much so that his hands and feet were\r\nuncovered. He had one bullet hole in his forehead, which would seem to\r\nindicate that the execution was not a military one, but that some\r\nofficer had, for some reason, shot him--perhaps in a moment of\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nFrom Senlis we went to Clermont, which is the headquarters of the left\r\nwing. There I had the great good fortune to be introduced to Gen.\r\nCastelnau, who showed me his maps and the way a battle was fought on\r\npaper. This is one of the greatest privileges I think I have ever\r\nenjoyed, and the curious part of it was that their way of working in the\r\nmilitary art is very similar to the way we plot and scheme as\r\narchitects. The General interested me as a very fine, simple citizen.\r\nAmong other things he said to me:\r\n\r\n     \"My dear Sir, how is it possible to fight with these people? They\r\n     seem to have no mercy, no decency. It really seems impossible to\r\n     know how to meet them.\"\r\n\r\nHe had with him several of his staff officers and one of them was\r\ncharged with making a report upon the atrocities committed. He allowed\r\nme to read several of these reports and showed me photographs of one\r\nincident that impressed me greatly. These photographs this officer had\r\ntaken himself and in order to prove that he had seen the incident and\r\nwas on the ground he was himself in the photograph. This special\r\nhappening was as follows:\r\n\r\nIn some little town to the east the Germans had taken out sixteen\r\npeasants and field laborers. They bound their hands either in front or\r\nat the back, tied them in bunches of five, cut their suspenders and\r\nunbuttoned their trousers so that escape was impossible and shot them in\r\nan open field. The report contained the names and ages of these poor\r\nchaps. The oldest, I remember, was 67, and several were over 50. The\r\nFrench had been able to get no explanation whatever of what had\r\noccurred, as the village was absolutely deserted. The persecution of\r\nwomen seems to be quite prevalent.\r\n\r\nFrom here we returned to Paris, passing by Creil and Chantilly without\r\nany incident, arriving in Paris at about 8 o'clock at night.\r\n\r\nWHITNEY WARREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO BEGAN THE WAR, AND WHY?\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIALISTS' PART\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMIL VAN DER VELDE,\r\nBelgian Minister of State and Chairman International\r\nSocialist Bureau.\r\n(_Photo from Wiener Agency._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISTS ARMED AGAINST EACH OTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcluding Remarks of Emil Vandervelde, Belgian Minister of State,\r\nChairman International Socialist Bureau, in Harlem Casino, New York,\r\nSept. 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou in the United States represent the International within a nation.\r\nYou have undertaken to do what no nation of Europe has ever\r\naccomplished.

The International,\r\nunfortunately divided by war, has not been seen in Europe in weeks. I\r\nfind it again in the United States. These United States, which are to\r\nbe, not merely the United States of America, or the United States of\r\ncapitalism, but the United States of the Socialism of the world.\r\n\r\nAt the last meeting of the International Socialist Bureau in Paris I can\r\nsee gathered at the same table, Hugo Haase, the Chairman of the\r\nParliamentary group of the German Social Democracy, drafting resolutions\r\nof peace on behalf of the entire International.

As the solidarity of workmen does not shut out the\r\nright to defend themselves against traitor workmen, so international\r\nsolidarity does not exclude the right of one nation to defend itself\r\nagainst a Government traitor to the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nFrance has been attacked, and she will have no more ardent defenders\r\nthan the workmen's party.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JULES GUESDE,\r\nFrench Cabinet Minister and Exponent of French Socialism.\r\n(_Photo from Trans Atlantic Co._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINISTER JULES GUESDE.\r\n\r\nEditorial Article in the New Yorker Volkszeitung, Aug. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho would have suspected in 1904 that Jules Guesde would come to be once\r\nmore a member of a Ministry, popular in its majority? Who would have\r\nthought then--it was in the time of the memorable debates over\r\nsocialistic \"ministerialism\" in the Amsterdam Congress of the\r\nInternational--that there ever could come a time when this clear-headed\r\nand unswerving exponent of academic socialism would be forced by the\r\nneed of the hour to take a step which in ordinary circumstances would be\r\nabsolutely inconceivable for him?\r\n\r\nAnd now this has actually happened. Jules Guesde, who has been\r\ncalled--in contrast to the easily moved emotional Jaurès--the\r\nstiff-necked dogmatist, is not only become Minister, but with him\r\nanother proved Socialist champion, Marcel Sembat, who for his part too\r\nwould rather have split the party than to have approved the entrance of\r\nMillerand into the Cabinet of Waldeck Rousseau.\r\n\r\nBut now these two are sitting on the same Ministerial bench, not only\r\nwith this self-same Millerand, but with the much more deeply despised\r\nrenegade Briand, with the anti-Socialist abettor Ribot, and the\r\ndisgusting reactionary and favorite of the Czar, Pelcassi. The world\r\nseems to be unhinged.\r\n\r\nYet the incomprehensible is under the existing circumstances only too\r\neasily understood, Guesde and Sembat have taken this difficult step,\r\nbecause there was no other choice for them, they had to take it. They,\r\nas representatives of a party which had sent 102 members to the Chamber\r\nof Deputies, could not refuse, when this was the question, to create a\r\nMinistry for Defense.\r\n\r\nThat was the question! It was demanded of all the larger parties that\r\nthey put up their best--that is, their intellectually strongest--men for\r\na Cabinet whose sole task was the defense of France. When this task is\r\naccomplished, when the war is ended in one way or the other, then the\r\nMinistry will undoubtedly dissolve, and the Ministerial magnificance of\r\nComrades Guesde and Sembat will be at an end until the opportunity\r\noffers of creating a Socialist Ministry.\r\n\r\nFrance, according to all news emanating from the scene of hostilities,\r\nis in an extraordinarily difficult situation. Should the German Army\r\nsucceed, as seems already to have been the case in two places, in\r\nbreaking through the French-Belgian-English chain of defense, then the\r\nway to Paris is as good as open. If nothing more, at least the reported\r\npreparations of the Parisians indicate that a siege is expected there in\r\nthe very near future; and since Paris is still the heart of France, the\r\ntaking of that city would be one with the fall of the French Republic.\r\n\r\nIf in such an hour of danger a nation calls upon its sons, there is for\r\nthem no choice; they must answer the call.\r\n\r\nJules Guesde and Marcel Sembat did no more than their duty!\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"REVOLUTION!\"\r\n\r\nCry Raised by Jean Jaurès at Session of International Socialist Bureau,\r\nBrussels, July 29.\r\n\r\nThe diplomats negotiate. It seems that they will be satisfied to take\r\nfrom Servia a little of its blood. We have, therefore, a little rest to\r\ninsure peace. But to what lesson is Europe submitted? When after twenty\r\ncenturies of Christianity, when after 100 years of the triumph of the\r\nprinciples of the rights of men, how is it possible that millions of\r\npersons, without knowing why, can kill each other?\r\n\r\nAnd Germany? If she knew of the Austrian note, it is inexcusable to have\r\npermitted such a step. And if she did not know of this Austrian note,\r\nwhat is her Governmental wisdom? You have an agreement which drags you\r\ninto war and you do not know what you have been dragged for? I ask, What\r\npeople have shown so much anarchy?\r\n\r\nNevertheless the authorities hesitate. Let us profit by it and organize.\r\nFor us, French Socialists, our duty is simple. We do not need to impose\r\non our Government a policy of peace. They are practicing it. I, who have\r\nnever hesitated to bring upon my head the hatred of our patriots by my\r\ndesire to bring about a Franco-German understanding, have the right to\r\nsay that at this time the French Government desires peace.\r\n\r\nThe French Government is the best ally for peace of the English\r\nGovernment, which has taken the initiative in conciliation and gives to\r\nRussia advice of prudence and patience.\r\n\r\nAs for us, it is our duty to insist that it shall speak with force that\r\nRussia may abstain. If unfortunately Russia does not abstain, it is our\r\nduty to say, \"We do not know of any other treaty except the one which\r\nbinds us to the human race.\"\r\n\r\nThis is our duty, and in expressing it we find ourselves in accord with\r\nour German comrades who demand of their Government to see to it that\r\nAustria moderates its acts. It is possible that the telegram of which I\r\nspoke is due partly to that desire of the German workers. One cannot go\r\nagainst the wish of four millions of enlightened consciences.\r\n\r\nDo you know what the proletariat is? They are the men who have\r\ncollectively an affection for peace and a horror for war. The\r\nchauvinists, the nationalists, &c., are men who have collectively an\r\naffection for war and carnage. When they feel, however, over their heads\r\nthe menace of conflicts, or wars which may put an end to their\r\ncapitalist existence, then they remind themselves that they have friends\r\nwho seek to reduce the storm. But for the supreme masters the ground is\r\nmined. In the drunkenness of the first battles they succeed in pulling\r\nalong the masses. In proportion as typhus completes the work of death\r\nand misery these men will turn to the masters of Germany, France,\r\nRussia, Austria, Italy, and so on, and will demand what reason they can\r\ngive for all those corpses. And then the revolution will tell them: Go\r\nand demand grace from God and men.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSURE IS NECESSARY.\r\n\r\nEditorial Article for l'Humanite, Written by Jean Jaurès on the Night\r\nHe Was Assassinated, July 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we put things at their worst, if we take, in view of the most\r\nformidable hypothesis, the necessary precautions, let us keep the\r\nlucidity of our spirit, the firmness of our reason. To judge from all\r\nthe common elements, it does not seem that the international situation\r\nis desperate. To be sure, it is grave, but all chances of an amicable\r\nadjustment have not disappeared. On one side it is evident that if\r\nGermany had a design to attack us she would have proceeded according to\r\nthe famous sudden attack. On the contrary, she has allowed days to pass,\r\nand France, like Russia, could have put to profit this delay, the one,\r\nRussia, in order to proceed to a partial mobilization, the other,\r\nFrance, to take precautions compatible with the maintenance of peace.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Austria and Russia have entered into direct\r\nnegotiations. Russia demands of Austria what treatment she reserves for\r\nServia. Austria answers that she will respect her \"territorial\r\nintegrity.\" Russia figures that it is not enough and that it must also\r\ninclude that \"the sovereign rights of Servia are guaranteed.\"\r\n\r\nEven if discord comes between the views of Austria and those of Russia,\r\none could measure the distance of the ideas and work on a solution of a\r\nproblem whose points are determined. It is then, it seems, that the\r\nEnglish idea of mediation which seeks a form, its means of expression,\r\nbut which in the end will prevail, for it embodies the profound\r\nsentiments of the people, and without doubt the desire of the rulers\r\nwho feel rising toward them, like punishment, this peril of war, with\r\nwhich for a moment they thought of playing like a diplomatic toy.\r\n\r\nIf we judge what war itself will be and the effects it will produce by\r\npanic, sinister rumors, economic difficulties, monetary difficulties,\r\nand the financial disasters which the mere possibility of a conflict\r\ncreates; when we think that even now we must postpone payments, and\r\nprepare to decree a forced circulation for the paper certificates, one\r\nasks if the most crazy or the sanest of men are capable to open such a\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger at this time is not, if I can say it, in the events\r\nthemselves. It is not even in the real dispositions of the\r\nchancelleries, however guilty they may be; it is not in the real will of\r\nthe people; it is in the nervousness which is gaining, in the worry\r\nwhich is spread, in the sudden impulse which grows from fear, of the\r\ngrowing uncertainty, prolonged anxiety. To these crazy panics the crowd\r\nmay give in, and it is not sure that the Governments, too, may give in.\r\nThey spend their time (delicious occupation) to frighten and to reassure\r\neach other. And this, do not mistake, can last for weeks. Those who\r\nimagine that a diplomatic crisis must be or can be settled in a few days\r\nare mistaken. Just as the battles of modern war develop on an immense\r\nfront, last seven or eight days, the same way the diplomatic battles,\r\nplacing now in the game entire Europe and involving a number of powerful\r\nnations, will spread necessarily over several weeks. To resist this test\r\none must have nerves of steel, or, better still, they need a firm\r\nreasoning, clear and calm. It is to the intelligence of the people, it\r\nis to their reasoning, that we must now make an appeal if we wish them\r\nto remain masters of themselves, escape the panics, dominate the\r\nexcitement, and supervise the march of men and things, to spare the\r\nhuman race from the horror of war.\r\n\r\nThe danger is great, but it is not unavoidable if we preserve clearness\r\nof mind and a strong will, if we have both heroism of patience and\r\nheroism of action. The clear view of our duty will give us the power to\r\naccomplish it.\r\n\r\nAll the militant Socialist members of the Federation of the Seine are\r\ncalled, for next Sunday morning, to Wagram Hall, to a meeting where the\r\nsituation will be explained, where the action which the International\r\nexpects of you will be defined.\r\n\r\nA number of meetings will keep in action the thought and will of the\r\nproletariat and will prepare the magnificent demonstration which will be\r\na prelude to the labors of the International Congress.\r\n\r\nWhat counts now is the continuity of action, the constant awakening of\r\nthe reason and conscience of the workers. There lies true salvation.\r\nThere lies the guarantee of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSURE FOR PEACE.\r\n\r\nResolutions of International Socialist Bureau at Brussels, July 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn assembly of July 29 the International Socialist Bureau has heard\r\ndeclarations from representatives of all nations threatened by a world\r\nwar, describing the political situation in their respective countries.\r\n\r\nWith unanimous vote, the bureau considers it an obligation for the\r\nworkers of all nations concerned not only to continue but even to\r\nstrengthen their demonstrations against war in favor of peace and of a\r\nsettlement of the Austro-Servian conflict by arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe German and French workers will bring to bear on their Governments\r\nthe most vigorous pressure in order that Germany may secure in Austria a\r\nmoderating action, and in order that France may obtain from Russia an\r\nundertaking that she will not engage in the conflict. On their side the\r\nworkers of Great Britain and Italy shall sustain these efforts with all\r\nthe power at their command.\r\n\r\nThe congress urgently convoked in Paris [it was never held] will be the\r\nvigorous expression of the absolutely peaceful will of the workers of\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\nIt is further resolved that the International Socialist Bureau\r\ncongratulates the Russian workers on their revolutionary attitude, and\r\ninvites them to continue their heroic efforts against Czardom as being\r\none of the most effective guarantees against the threatened world war.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGO HAASE AT BRUSSELS.\r\n\r\nSpeech of German Social Democratic Leader on July 30, Five Days Before\r\nHis Declaration in the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor twenty-five years Austria-Hungary has been attempting to strangle\r\nServia economically. Therefore, the ultimatum sent to Servia must be\r\nregarded as a provocation to long desired war. As you know, Servia's\r\nanswer was so conciliatory in tone that if Austria had had the honest\r\ndesire peace could have been brought about. Austria wanted war.\r\n\r\nThe most fearful thing about it all is that this criminal sport may\r\ndeluge all Europe with blood. A telegram says that Austria does not wish\r\nto carry on a long war with Servia, but only intends taking the capital\r\ncity, Belgrade, by way of teaching Servia a lesson. This rôle of the\r\nteacher punishing the pupils is both reprehensible and dastardly.\r\n\r\nAustria seems to count upon Germany's help. Nevertheless, the German\r\nSocialists declare that secret negotiations have very little weight with\r\nthe proletariat. The German proletariat says that Germany is not to\r\ninvolve herself, even if Russia enters in. The German capitalists, on\r\nthe other hand, demand that Germany step in because Austria makes war\r\nwith Servia. And on the same illogical, reprehensible grounds the French\r\ncapitalists are demanding war with Germany. The French proletariat is\r\none with the German proletariat.\r\n\r\nThe people, sunk deep in want and despair, will at last awake and\r\nestablish socialism. Yesterday thousands and tens of thousands of them\r\nin Berlin protested against the war. Their slogan was: \"Long live peace,\r\nand down with war!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAASE IN THE REICHSTAG.\r\n\r\nSpeech of Aug. 4--\"We Do Not Desert Our Fatherland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are face to face with a great crisis. The consequences of the\r\nimperialistic policy by means of which an era of competitive preparation\r\nfor war has been inaugurated, and which has served to intensify hostile\r\nfeeling between nations, have swept down over Europe like a torrent. The\r\nresponsibility lies with those who have upheld this policy; we refuse\r\nit. [Applause from the Socialists.] Social Democracy has fought this\r\ndisastrous development with all its strength, and even up to the very\r\nlast hour, by means of prodigious public demonstrations, particularly in\r\nclose co-operation with its brothers in France, [applause from the\r\nSocialists,] it has labored for the maintenance of peace. Its endeavors\r\nhave been in vain. We now stand before the brazen facts of actual war;\r\nthe horrors of hostile invasion threaten us. It is not for us today to\r\ndecide for or against war, but to deliberate on the problem of the\r\navailable means of national defense. We have now to think of the\r\nmillions of our fellow-countrymen who, through no fault of theirs, have\r\nbeen drawn into this disaster. [Applause.] They will be the ones to\r\nsuffer most heavily from the devastation of this war.\r\n\r\nOur warmest sympathy, accorded without reference to party, accompanies\r\nall our brothers who have been called to the front. [Vigorous applause\r\nfrom all sides of the House.] We are thinking also of the mothers who\r\nmust give up their sons, of the women and children robbed of their\r\nmainstay and support, of those whom, to the anxiety of their loved ones,\r\nthe pangs of hunger threaten. To these will very soon be added tens of\r\nthousands of wounded and crippled soldiers. To stand by them all, to\r\nease their misfortune, to alleviate their immeasurable need--this we\r\nconsider our compelling duty. [Vigorous applause.]\r\n\r\nWith a victory of the Russian despotism, which is stained with the blood\r\nof the best of its own people, much, if not all, which concerns our\r\npeople and their future in freedom will be at stake. [Storm of\r\napplause.]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to ward off the danger in order to render secure the\r\nculture and the independence of our own country. [Vigorous applause.]\r\n\r\nThus do we actualize what we have always claimed--in the hour of danger\r\nwe do not desert our Fatherland! [Vigorous demonstrations of approval.]\r\n\r\nIn this regard we feel ourselves in perfect accord with the\r\nInternational, which has at all times recognized the right of every\r\npeople to natural independence and self-defense, just as we agree with\r\nit in denouncing every war of conquest.\r\n\r\nWe demand that as soon as this purpose of securing national safety is\r\nachieved, and the combatants shall be disposed toward peace, that an end\r\nbe made to the war through a peace which shall facilitate friendship\r\nbetween neighboring peoples. We demand this not only in the interests of\r\nthat international solidarity for which we have continually fought, but\r\nalso in the interests of the German people. We hope that the grisly\r\nlessons learned from suffering in this conflict will waken in new\r\nmillions of hearts the horror of war, and will win them over to the\r\nideal of Socialism and peace between nations.\r\n\r\nGuided by these principles, we approve the proposed appropriations.\r\n[Vigorous applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SOCIALISTS DIVIDED.\r\n\r\nLetter from Dr. Carl Liebknecht, Social-Democratic Member of the\r\nReichstag, in the Burger Zeitung, Bremen, Sept. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that several members of the Socialist Party have written\r\nall sorts of things to the press with regard to the deliberations of\r\nthe Socialist Party in the Reichstag on Aug. 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nAccording to these reports there were no serious differences of opinion\r\nin our party in regard to the political situation, and our own position\r\nand decision to assent to war credits are alleged to have been arrived\r\nat unanimously.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the dissemination of an inadmissible legend I feel\r\nit to be my duty to put on record the fact that the issues involved gave\r\nrise to diametrically opposite views within our parliamentary party, and\r\nthese opposing views found expression with a violence hitherto unknown\r\nin our deliberations.\r\n\r\nIt is also entirely untrue to say that assent to the war credits was\r\ngiven unanimously.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIPP SCHEIDEMANN,\r\nChairman German Socialist Party and ex-Vice President\r\nof the Reichstag.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIALISTS STILL GERMANS.\r\n\r\nLetter from Philipp Scheidemann, Ex-Vice President of the Reichstag, in\r\nthe New Yorker Volkszeitung, Sept. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERLIN, Aug. 21.\r\n\r\n----, I send you a few facts.\r\n\r\nNo one in Germany wanted this war. The fact that Germany declared war on\r\nRussia and finally on France does not contradict this statement. If\r\nGermany, who was exactly informed as to the preparations being made by\r\nher neighbors, had delayed for ever so short a time, Russia would have\r\ncompleted her mobilization which she had secretly been carrying on for\r\nsome time, and with her Cossacks would have swept down on our eastern\r\ncountry which was only moderately well protected. And then woe to us!\r\n\r\nThat the Government, after the failure of all its efforts to maintain\r\npeace, promptly took the initiative, disturbed not a little the Czar of\r\nRussia. This was perhaps indicated most dramatically by his manifesto to\r\nthe Jews. This same Czar, whose hands are stained with the blood of many\r\nthousands of the Jews whom his servants of slaughter have murdered\r\nduring the pogroms, this same Czar who has degraded and abused the Jews\r\nin the most inhuman fashion, has now, in order to create an agreeable\r\nimpression, issued a manifesto \"to my beloved Jews!\" Now when he has to\r\nfear that the Poles and those Jews living in Russian Poland may rise up\r\nagainst his army of shame, now does he begin to make bright promises for\r\nthe future!\r\n\r\nRussia to Blame.\r\n\r\nUpon Russia rests the entire responsibility for the present war. While\r\nthe Czar was still negotiating with the German Kaiser for the declared\r\npurpose of bringing about peace, he was arming his troops not only\r\nagainst Austria but against Germany.\r\n\r\nThat France, republican France, has allied herself with Russian\r\nabsolutism for the purpose of murder and destruction, is an almost\r\ninconceivable fact. And that England, parliamentarian England,\r\ndemocratic England, is fighting side by side with the Russians for\r\n\"freedom and culture,\" that is a truly gigantic and shameless piece of\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\nI do not need to place before those of our readers who are schooled in\r\nsocialism any comments on the causes of this war--the fact itself as it\r\nstands is of a stupendous, terrifying magnitude. And it is with this\r\nfact that we have now to reckon. Russia, France, Belgium, England,\r\nServia, Montenegro and Japan are now involved in this battle for\r\n\"freedom and culture,\" which means fighting against Germany, against the\r\nworld which has given birth to Goethe, to Kant and to Karl Marx! It\r\nwould be laughable were the situation not so desperately grave.\r\n\r\nSocialism in each of the West European powers has done all it could to\r\nprevent the war. Its strength could not sufficiently prevail--it was not\r\nenough. On Aug. 1, 1914, socialism in each country found itself\r\nconfronted with the hideous certainty of war. What was to be done?\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of August there was no longer any possibility whatsoever of\r\nsending a letter or telegram across the German frontier. The telegram of\r\ncondolence which we sent to Paris on the assassination of Jean Jaurès\r\nnever arrived. Socialism in each country was forced back entirely upon\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAt the time when I am writing this letter, Aug. 21, we in Germany know\r\nabsolutely nothing concerning the details of the action taken in the\r\nBelgian and French Parliament. Only this much has penetrated to us, that\r\nour comrades in all of the countries under consideration have come to\r\nthe same conclusion as we in Germany. The French have approved the war\r\ncredits, the Belgians have admitted Vandervelde to the Ministry for\r\nDefense. That our comrades in England have come out for the strictest\r\nneutrality is easily understood. Any other attitude on their part would\r\nbe a crime against socialism. No one would be so ignorant as to find\r\nanalogies between the situation of the German and the English\r\nSocialists. We in Germany had to perform the duty of protecting\r\nourselves against Czarism, we had to accomplish the task of saving the\r\ncountry in which Social Democracy has reached its highest point of\r\ndevelopment, from impending subjection to Russia. In England the\r\ndecision had to be made only as to whether sides should be taken in the\r\nconflict between Russia and Germany, or whether neutrality should be\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nA Germany under the yoke of the Czar would have set back a century the\r\nSocialist movement not only of Germany itself but of the whole world.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we Social Democrats have never ceased to be Germans, because\r\nwe belong to the Socialist International. And if we in the Reichstag\r\nhave unanimously approved the war credit, we have done no more after all\r\nthan to carry out what has often been repeated by our greatest\r\nSocialists from the Reichstag platform.\r\n\r\nQuotes Bebel and Elder Liebknecht.\r\n\r\nThe words of Bebel and of the elder Liebknecht have always been heard\r\nwith favor in America. And what, for example, has Bebel said in this\r\nconnection?\r\n\r\n     In the preservation of Germany's independence all the laboring\r\n     classes, to the very least among them, are just as much concerned\r\n     as those who consider themselves the chosen leaders and rulers of\r\n     the people, and the working class in nowise desires to bend its\r\n     back under any sort of foreign rule.\r\n\r\nStill more fully did Bebel declare himself during the session of the\r\nReichstag of March 7, 1904. At that time he said:\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen: You cannot in the future carry on any successful wars\r\n     without our aid. [\"Very true!\" \"Right!\" from the Socialists.] If\r\n     you conquer you will conquer with us and not against us; without\r\n     our help you can no longer subsist. [\"True!\" \"Right!\" from the\r\n     Socialists.] I will go still further, we would have the greatest\r\n     possible interest were we to be involved in a war--a war in which\r\n     the existence of Germany was threatened, for--and I give you my\r\n     word for it--we are ready to the last and the oldest man among us\r\n     to shoulder arms and protect German soil not in service to you but\r\n     to ourselves--as far as I am concerned, in fact in defiance of you.\r\n     [\"True indeed!\" \"Right!\" from the Socialists.]\r\n\r\n     We live and fight on this soil, the land of our fathers, as much if\r\n     not more our fatherland than yours, to the end that it will be a\r\n     joy even for the last and least among us to live therein. [\"Very\r\n     good!\" from the Socialists.]\r\n\r\n     That is our endeavor and that it is which we are laboring to\r\n     achieve, and it is for this reason that we shall repulse with all\r\n     the power at our command and to our very last breath every attempt\r\n     to snatch from this Fatherland one inch of land. [\"Very good!\" from\r\n     the Socialists.]\r\n\r\nThere are numerous declarations of similar nature which have been\r\nuttered by our great friend, Wilhelm Liebknecht has also spoken in\r\nsimilar fashion. On the 28th of November, 1888, he addressed the\r\nReichstag as follows:\r\n\r\n     What the opponents of German consolidation over there in France and\r\n     Russia fear is a German people united for the defense of their\r\n     land. And in this regard--that I can assure you--I have personally\r\n     removed for our part every doubt, if any existed, among influential\r\n     French politicians; if France attacks, straightway there is no\r\n     party in Germany on which she can rely, and straightway every\r\n     Socialist in Germany is pledged and prepared to march against the\r\n     invader.\r\n\r\nFor years we have been slandered by our enemies in Germany as traitors\r\nand worse. The imperial anti-Socialist association has had an excellent\r\nexample of this alleged treachery of ours. Our vote has stretched the\r\nanti-Socialists in the dust, together with all the other political\r\nvultures who have lived by slandering us.\r\n\r\nAs Socialists of firm conviction we have voted for the war credit and\r\nmoved this vote through a declaration from the party representative,\r\nHaase. In our programme we have demanded that a volunteer army replace\r\nthe standing army. Why do we demand the volunteer army? Because we\r\nconsider it the best protection against every attack on the Fatherland.\r\nThis is it, then! We, too, wish to defend the Fatherland. Suppose that\r\ninstead we had said in the hour of need: Yes, we want to protect our\r\nFatherland against the knout regiments of the Czar all right enough, but\r\nwe demand that protection from the militia! Since we do not as yet have\r\nthe militia, we shall make no use of the standing army, for we would\r\nrather let the Cossacks into the country!\r\n\r\nFrom whatever side we consider the situation, we German Socialists could\r\nnot have acted otherwise than we have. A party like that of Social\r\nDemocracy, the strongest in the country, cannot avoid the facts by\r\nhiding its head in the sand; it must act! It is no exaggeration to state\r\nthat in the present crisis the entire German people is united. That\r\nwhole nation is determined, cost what it may, to end the war as speedily\r\nas possible, but at the same time victoriously. There is no one here who\r\nfeels any resentment toward France, and every one wishes that a worthy\r\npeace will be established between Germany and France as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nEngland's Shameful Role.\r\n\r\nEngland is playing a perfectly shameful rôle in this war. Even though\r\nFrance were allied to Russia by an unfortunate treaty, England was not\r\nso allied! But England, who has ever been jealous of the industrial\r\ndevelopment of our country, used the violation of our treaty of\r\nneutrality with Belgium, which was incurred only in dire need and which\r\nwas yielded openly and honestly in the Reichstag by the Chancellor, as a\r\npretext to declare war against us. And England crowned this abhorrent\r\naction by mobilizing against us an east-Asiatic nation. Japan, whose\r\nsons have enjoyed the most genuine and far-reaching hospitality at our\r\nhands, whose culture has been enriched through us, who has won from us\r\nour industrial secrets, shows herself suddenly as the most despicable,\r\nthe most treacherous nation of this whole world. I do not need to go\r\ninto details over the demands which Japan has presented to Germany, for\r\nI assume that your readers are already in full possession of the facts.\r\n\r\nGermany will perhaps lose a part of her colonial possessions in this\r\nwar. Germany is in no position to protect these against many enemies\r\nduring the war. Germany has steadily counted upon some colonial losses\r\nin the struggle. We Socialists especially have in our opposition to\r\ncapitalistic colonial policy continually pointed to the fact that in the\r\nevent of war colonies cannot be retained.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, however, Germany is of good courage. No one has the\r\nslightest doubt that our country will claim victory against the hostile\r\noppression from without. In the meantime you in America have long since\r\nlearned that all announcements of defeats which Germany is said to have\r\nsuffered in the east, in the west, and on the sea, are lies. It is true\r\nthat at Schirmek in Alsace a few cannon were lost by our troops. But, on\r\nthe other hand, the fact is established that in the very first days\r\nafter mobilization all the enemies' troops were completely driven from\r\nGermany, and further, that during the mobilization of our troops\r\nvictorious battles occurred at Mülhausen and Lagarde in Alsace; that in\r\nthe east they have made sharp inroads on the Russians; that they\r\novercame Lüttich with all its forts and captured Brussels on the 20th of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nHere in Germany we are expecting every moment news of the taking of\r\nNamur. The quicker decisive battles take place, by so much sooner will\r\nthere be some possibility of establishing peace with France.\r\n\r\nPHILIPP SCHEIDEMANN.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CRITIQUE OF WEAPONS.\"\r\n\r\nKarl Kautsky, in the Neue Zeit, Berlin, Aug. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kautsky has for over a quarter of a century been one of the foremost\r\nSocialist leaders in Germany; the founder and present editor of the Neue\r\nZeit. The present article on the war appeared before the periodical was\r\nsuppressed by the Government._\r\n\r\nWar, with all its attendant horrors, has broken loose, the \"Critique of\r\nWeapons\" has been set up, and the weapons of criticism are consequently\r\nbroken. This is not merely the inevitable result of the automatic\r\nlimitations which would be imposed by any state of war, but\r\nrather--though this is but a transitory phase--because of an absolute\r\nlack of interest in any sort of critical estimate of the whole\r\nsituation. In breathless suspense, every man is concentrating the whole\r\nof his mental energy on the news of the next moment, news concerning\r\nwhich none can make even fairly clear surmise, and about which one fact\r\nonly is known in advance, that whatever it is, it is sure to be\r\nhorrible. For relief from this wretched suspense men are looking to\r\ndispatches and decisions of battles, not to critical speculation.\r\n\r\nYet by the time these lines come before the reader this stage may\r\nalready be giving way, and in all probability there will be beginning to\r\nbe felt the need of regaining our usual attitude, of taking account of\r\nthis monstrous event which has broken in on us so suddenly--so\r\nunexpectedly that for the moment it has stunned us--of making ourselves\r\nclear concerning the end toward which we are moving.\r\n\r\nOf course, to discuss the chances of each or any of the combatants\r\ninvolved is out of the question; indeed, it would be a difficult task\r\nfor the shrewdest military expert to establish a sound estimate, for\r\nthere are probably few, perhaps none, to whom the armies under\r\nconsideration are sufficiently well known for that. Besides all this,\r\nmoreover, the present conflict is taking place under conditions\r\nabsolutely different from any we have before known, totally new to our\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nFormerly, when the situation was more simple than at present, there were\r\nalways at the outbreak of war a few experienced experts who could\r\ncorrectly estimate the prospects for each side in the struggle, for it\r\nwas usually fairly clear from the very beginning what each side wanted\r\nto gain and what in the case of victory each would gain. But in the\r\npresent situation there is not a word of prophecy which can be uttered\r\nin face of the fact that the most terrible war known to history has\r\nbroken out without any of the powers involved in the least wishing it.\r\nIt was in Russia first that at the last moment the war party seemed to\r\nhave gained the upper hand and to have set in motion the whole bloody\r\nsport. We may rely on it that the statesmen of Austria were of the\r\nhonest belief that they could localize the conflict with Servia.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible any longer to consider this world war as a\r\ncontinuation of that conflict. Servia has vanished completely from the\r\nhorizon, and in the moment when that end disappeared from view, each\r\nnation found itself suddenly fighting for nothing else save its own\r\nnational integrity. The real purposes in this war will not come to the\r\nsurface until the balance of the power becomes a little more sharply\r\ndefined. Then in the victors' camp all manner of purposes and desires\r\nwill suddenly spring up wide awake.\r\n\r\nWhen Everything Is Over.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, little as may be affirmed today concerning the prospects for\r\nthe parties in this struggle and the manner of the war's conclusion,\r\nthis assertion may safely be put forth; this world will wear a vastly\r\ndifferent appearance when everything is over.\r\n\r\nWe hope, and may reasonably expect, that the war will be relatively\r\nshort. The Franco-Prussian war lasted from the middle of July to the end\r\nof February; military operations began early in August and closed with\r\nthe truce of Jan. 28. That the present war will be dragged out to so\r\ngreat a length, involving so incredible a number of men, demanding so\r\nsevere a straining of energies--especially the financial--on the part of\r\nall the nations, is hardly conceivable. But however short a time it may\r\nlast, we shall emerge a world very different from before.\r\n\r\nThe time is long since past when a great war brings in its train no\r\nchanges other than the ceding of a few square miles of conquered\r\nterritory. Under the capitalistic method of production, continual\r\nchanges, irreconcilable situations, constantly new problems pile up so\r\nrapidly that no great war is any longer possible which does not bring\r\nwith it a prolonged breaking down as well as a building up of industrial\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nEspecially is it clear that the non-European world will undergo a\r\npowerful change. The non-European nations are already in the ascendency;\r\nmore and more they are becoming a strong opposition force to Europe.\r\nTheir advance must win tremendous impetus from a war which in every case\r\nwill weaken seriously the European nations, no matter how it may swing\r\nthe balance of power among them.\r\n\r\nThe United States particularly will derive the greatest profit from the\r\nstruggle. Without any exertion whatsoever she is already able to control\r\nthe entire American market, and in the Far East it is possible for her\r\nto exercise considerable restraint on her European competitors. In time\r\nshe will be in a position to constitute herself the only great money\r\npower of that section of the world which employs the use of free\r\ncapital. Already there is a colossal stream of European securities\r\nflowing to the United States, who is acquiring them at the very lowest\r\nprices. The remedy for the economic wrongs of Europe which will be\r\ncreated by this war as well as the fixing of indemnities will not be\r\npossible without the aid of America. At the very least, the conquered\r\nnations will be wholly dependent on American capital.\r\n\r\nNext to the United States in this amazingly swift advance stand the\r\nnations of Asia and of Islam--Japan, China, India, Persia, Turkey with\r\nher tributary possessions. The progress of these nations has been\r\nconsiderably hampered by the control--both financial and\r\nmilitary--exerted over them by the European powers. In the free States\r\nthis control has been suddenly lifted; in the dependencies, such as\r\nIndia, Persia, and Egypt, it has been materially weakened, and it will\r\nbe long before it can again operate with the same force. We must reckon\r\nwith the possibility of revolt among these nations and of their entrance\r\ninto the world war. Russia, England, France--these could be considerably\r\nweakened by such a turn of affairs. Colonial policy would then show the\r\nobverse side of the medal. It might well prove a decided source of\r\nmilitary and economic strength for Germany that her colonial possessions\r\nare relatively unimportant.\r\n\r\nWorld Imperialism Doomed.\r\n\r\nThe stronger the non-European nations become, the fewer grow the\r\npossibilities for a continuation of the policy of empire. This world\r\nwar, born in the very midst of imperialism, can readily end in\r\ncircumstances which knock the supports from under the imperialistic\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nIt may be said similarly of our worldwide preparation for war, that it\r\ntoo has been a direct consequence of imperialism; and our own party has\r\nsteadily maintained that it would create an atmosphere in which powder\r\nwould finally go off of itself--a spontaneous combustion.\r\n\r\nThe burdens imposed by this war will be so terrible that from the\r\nfinancial point of view it may be extremely difficult if not absolutely\r\nimpossible when peace shall at length have been concluded to add thereto\r\nthe burden of renewed preparation for war, especially in the face of\r\ncompetition with America, strong and industrially intact.\r\n\r\nThese changes must inevitably give an entirely new aspect to our\r\nexternal as well as to our internal political state. To what extent will\r\nfollow changes in the political relations of the different classes it is\r\ntoo early yet to surmise. But here also there is every assurance for the\r\nassertion that political life will recommence stronger than ever\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the \"Critique of Weapons\" ceases, immediately the weapons of\r\ncriticism are bound to take on a sharper edge. What forms critical\r\neffort will assume, against what it will direct its force, what\r\ncircumstances will bring it to maturity, all of this lies in the lap of\r\nTime. In any case, Social Democracy, like any other party, will in that\r\ntime need the full measure of its strength to assert itself and to\r\nprotect the interests of the class of which it is made up. To preserve\r\nthis strength through the vicissitudes which the future has in store is\r\npresently to be the most important problem of our internal politics.\r\n\r\nWe must hold intact the organizations and the party organs together with\r\nthe trade unions; we must guard their members from imprudences as well\r\nas from defection. This goes without saying and there is no true comrade\r\nwho will not act in this spirit.\r\n\r\nNo less necessary, however, is unity within the party, the absolute\r\nrelinquishing of all petty individual grievances. We are a party\r\ncommitted to self-criticism, but in time of a great crisis criticism\r\nmust become mute. Never has it been more difficult, never, in fact, less\r\npossible, to adopt and to maintain a position which would satisfy every\r\nSocialist without exception. Every war brings Social Democracy into the\r\nfatal dilemma between the necessity for defending our individual homes\r\non the one hand and, on the other, for preserving international\r\nsolidarity. The present war confronts us as well as the army staff with\r\nparticular difficulties, for it is a war possessing many faces. It is\r\nnot only a war against the Czar of Russia, but also against the\r\ndemocracies of France and England, whose Governments felt themselves\r\nforced out of fear of isolation and later subjection to stand by the\r\nRussian Czar.\r\n\r\nWe can very easily understand how to many this or that decision by our\r\nparty may seem a false step, but it would be still more false, still\r\nmore disastrous, were we, through any difference of opinion, to allow an\r\ninternal disagreement to arise. In time of war discipline is not for\r\nthe army alone; for a party it, too, is the first requirement. Under its\r\nrule we must all stand together, more courageous, more firmly united\r\nthan ever before. Not criticism but faith is now the essential condition\r\nof our success.\r\n\r\nKARL KAUTSKY.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIALISTS OF ITALY FIRM.\r\n\r\nManifesto Resenting German Mission of Herr Sudekum Issued by Socialist\r\nParty at Rome, Sept. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are Socialists, and we do not hesitate to proclaim that the sending\r\nof a Socialist mission from Germany to Italy at this moment cannot be\r\nfree from insidious suspicion; and as such it offends the dignity and\r\nthe independence of Italian socialism, and offends it so much more\r\nbecause international socialism knows that on German Socialists depended\r\nthe lesser or greater efficacy in the action of international socialism\r\nto arrest the provocative struggle of armaments promoted by Germany, and\r\nthus to prevent war.\r\n\r\nIt offends it so much more because the German Socialist Party, assuming\r\nfor the justification of the aggressive policy of Germany and Austria\r\nthe same arguments as the Kaiser's diplomacy, has lost the right to\r\nattach itself to the ties of international socialism.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far kept silent, not to disturb the neutrality proclaimed\r\nsince the outbreak of the war by the Italian people, irrevocably decided\r\nnot to dishonor themselves before the world and before history in giving\r\naid to Austria and Germany, and requiring peace after two years of war\r\nin Lybia.\r\n\r\nToday, however, we are no longer able to be silent in the presence of\r\nGerman Socialist activity encouraging the obscure play of diplomatic\r\nintrigues on the part of the Governments of the ex-Triple Alliance,\r\nwhich tends to move Italian neutrality toward the tortuous and perilous\r\npaths of indirect co-operation. We want to affirm that our wishes are\r\nfor the immediate cessation of the war without conquerors or conquered.\r\n\r\nBut if now this hope is vain, we express our desire that this infamous\r\nwar may be concluded by the defeat of those who have provoked it; the\r\nAustrian and German Empires, since the empires of Austria and Germany\r\nform the rampart of European reaction, even more than Russia, which is\r\nshaken by democratic and Socialist forces, which have shown that they\r\nknow how to attempt a heroic effort of liberation; since if the German\r\nand Austrian Empires emerge victorious from the war it will mean the\r\ntriumph of military absolutism in its most brutal expression, of a\r\nbarbarian horde massacring, devastating, destroying, and conquering in\r\nviolation of every treaty and right and law.\r\n\r\nNor do the German Socialists give us any confidence of knowing how to\r\nrestrain this; in the past they have only been able to realize\r\nadvantageous contrasts of labor and to attain gigantic election results\r\nwithout exercising any influence in the policy of their own country.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the German Empire may instead offer German socialism the\r\nopportunity of emerging from its voluntary impotence and redeem itself\r\nby breaking down the feudal political régime of the empire, taking away\r\nfrom Russian absolutism the assistance it has hitherto enjoyed, and\r\ncontributing to alter decisively the aims of all European policy.\r\n\r\nSince, finally, the victory of the French Republic, now imbued with\r\ngenuine socialism, and that of England, where the truest democracy\r\nflourishes, signifies the victory of a European political régime open to\r\nall social conquests and desiring peace, it signifies the agreement\r\nbetween States at last free and nationally reinforced by the limitation\r\nof armaments and the substitution of a system of national militia for\r\ndefense in the place of hordes professionally organized for aggression,\r\nwhich would imply the liberation as well of the German people.\r\n\r\nTherefore, under actual conditions, while nearly the whole of Europe is\r\nat war, we may well raise our cry of horror and of protest; but our\r\nprotest strikes only those who desired the war, not those who submit to\r\nit to defend themselves against oppression.\r\n\r\nIn this war is outlined on one side the defense of European reaction, on\r\nthe other the defense of all revolutions, past and future, brought about\r\nby historical necessity stronger than the intentions of Governments. And\r\nbecause of this we must confirm that there remains for us only one way\r\nof being internationalists--namely, to declare ourselves loyally in\r\nfavor of whoever fights the empires of reaction, just as the Italian\r\nSocialists residing in Paris have understood that one way only remains\r\nto be anti-militarist--to arm and fight against the empires of\r\nmilitarism.\r\n\r\nThis is our answer as Italian Socialists to the German Socialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KEIR HARDIE, M.P.,\r\nBritish Representative International Socialist Bureau.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH MANIFESTO.\r\n\r\nIssued by Keir Hardie and Arthur Henderson, July 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The long-threatened European war is now upon us. For more than 100\r\n     years no such danger has confronted civilization. It is for you to\r\n     take full account of the desperate situation and to act promptly\r\n     and vigorously in the interest of peace. You have never been\r\n     consulted about the war.\r\n\r\n     Whatever may be the rights and wrongs of the sudden, crushing\r\n     attack made by the militarist Empire of Austria upon Servia, it is\r\n     certain that the workers of all countries likely to be drawn into\r\n     the conflict must strain every nerve to prevent their Governments\r\n     from committing them to war.\r\n\r\n     Everywhere Socialists and the organized forces of labor are taking\r\n     this course. Everywhere vehement protests are made against the\r\n     greed and intrigues of militarists and armament mongers.\r\n\r\n     We call upon you to do the same here in Great Britain upon an even\r\n     more impressive scale. Hold vast demonstrations against war in\r\n     every industrial centre. Compel those of the governing class and\r\n     their press who are eager to commit you to co-operate with Russian\r\n     despotism to keep silence and respect the decision of the\r\n     overwhelming majority of the people, who will have neither part nor\r\n     lot in such infamy. The success of Russia at the present day would\r\n     be a curse to the world.\r\n\r\n     There is no time to lose. Already, by secret agreements and\r\n     understandings, of which the democracies of the civilized world\r\n     know only by rumor, steps are being taken which may fling us all\r\n     into the fray.\r\n\r\n     Workers, stand together therefore for peace! Combine and conquer\r\n     the militarist enemy and the self-seeking imperialists today, once\r\n     and for all.\r\n\r\n     Men and women of Britain, you have now an unexampled opportunity of\r\n     rendering a magnificent service to humanity and to the world!\r\n\r\n     Proclaim that for you the days of plunder and butchery have gone\r\n     by; send messages of peace and fraternity to your fellows who have\r\n     less liberty than you. Down with class rule! Down with the rule of\r\n     brute force! Down with war! Up with the peaceful rule of the\r\n     people!

KEIR HARDIE,\r\n\r\n     ARTHUR HENDERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEIR HARDIE'S QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nDirected at Sir Edward Grey, British Minister for Foreign Affairs, in\r\nHouse of Commons, Aug. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Keir Hardie_ (Merthyr Tydvil, Lab.) asked the Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs whether the suggestions for a peace settlement made by the\r\nGerman Ambassador, [\"White Paper,\" Page 66, Item No. 123,] together with\r\nhis invitation to the Foreign Secretary to put forward proposals of his\r\nown which would be acceptable as a basis for neutrality, were submitted\r\nto and considered by the Cabinet; and, if not, why proposals involving\r\nsuch far-reaching possibilities were thus rejected.\r\n\r\n_Sir E. Grey_ (Northumberland, Berwick)--These were personal suggestions\r\nmade by the Ambassador on Aug. 1, and without authority to alter the\r\nconditions of neutrality proposed to us by the German Chancellor in No.\r\n85 in the \"White Paper\"--Miscellaneous, No. 6, [1914.]\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet did, however, consider most carefully the next morning--that\r\nis, Sunday, Aug. 2--the conditions on which we could remain neutral, and\r\ncame to the conclusion that respect for the neutrality of Belgium must\r\nbe one of these conditions. [\"Hear, hear!\"] The German Chancellor had\r\nalready been told on July 30 that we could not bargain that way.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Aug. 3, I made a statement in the House accordingly. I had\r\nseen the German Ambassador again at his own request on Monday, and he\r\nurged me most strongly, though he said that he did not know the plans of\r\nthe German military authorities, not to make the neutrality of Belgium\r\none of our conditions when I spoke in the House. It was a day of great\r\npressure, for we had another Cabinet in the morning, and I had no time\r\nto record the conversation, and therefore it does not appear in the\r\n\"White Paper\"; but it was impossible to withdraw that condition [loud\r\ncheers] without becoming a consenting party to the violation of the\r\ntreaty, and subsequently to a German attack on Belgium.\r\n\r\nAfter I spoke in the House we made to the German Government the\r\ncommunication described in No. 153 in the \"White Paper\" about the\r\nneutrality of Belgium. Sir Edward Goschen's report of the reply to that\r\ncommunication had not been received when the \"White Paper\" was printed\r\nand laid. It will be laid before Parliament to complete the \"White\r\nPaper.\"\r\n\r\nI have been asked why I did not refer to No. 123 in the \"White Paper\"\r\nwhen I spoke in the House on Aug. 3. If I had referred to suggestions to\r\nus as to conditions of neutrality I must have referred to No. 85, the\r\nproposals made, not personally by the Ambassador, but officially by the\r\nGerman Chancellor, which were so condemned by the Prime Minister\r\nsubsequently, and this would have made the case against the German\r\nGovernment much stronger than I did make it in my speech. [\"Hear,\r\nhear!\"] I deliberately refrained from doing that then.\r\n\r\nLet me add this about personal suggestions made by the German\r\nAmbassador, as distinct from communications made on behalf of his\r\nGovernment. He worked for peace; but real authority at Berlin did not\r\nrest with him and others like him, and that is one reason why our\r\nefforts for peace failed. [Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Keir Hardie_--May I ask whether any attempt was made to open up\r\nnegotiations with Germany on the basis of suggestions here set forth by\r\nthe German Ambassador?\r\n\r\n_Sir E. Grey_--The German Ambassador did not make any basis of\r\nsuggestions. It was the German Chancellor who made the basis of\r\nsuggestions. The German Ambassador, speaking on his own personal\r\ninitiative and without authority, asked whether we would formulate\r\nconditions on which we would be neutral. We did go into that question,\r\nand those conditions were stated to the House and made known to the\r\nGerman Ambassador.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Keir Hardie_ [who was received with cries of \"Oh!\" from all parts\r\nof the House]--May I ask whether the German authorities at Berlin\r\nrepudiated the suggestions of their Ambassador in London, and whether\r\nany effort at all [renewed cries of \"Oh!\" and \"Order!\"] was made to find\r\nout how far the German Government would have agreed to the suggestions\r\nput before them by their own Ambassador?\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO MINISTER GREY.\r\n\r\nMade by J. Ramsay Macdonald, Member of Socialist Labor Party, in House\r\nof Commons, Aug. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would have preferred to remain silent this afternoon, but\r\ncircumstances do not permit of it. I shall model what I have to say\r\nupon the two speeches to which we have just listened. The right\r\nhonorable gentleman has delivered a speech the echoes of which will go\r\ndown in history. However much we may resist the conclusions to which we\r\nhave come, we have not been able to resist the moving character of his\r\nappeal [\"Hear, hear!\"]\r\n\r\nI think, however, he is wrong, and I think the Government for which he\r\nspeaks is wrong. I think the verdict of history will be that they are\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the right honorable gentleman's speech in this House will\r\nnot be its final effect. There may or may not be opportunities for us to\r\ngo into details, but I want to say to the House, and without\r\nprovocation, that if the right honorable gentleman had come here today\r\nand told us that our country was in danger, then I do not care what\r\nparty he appealed to or to what class, we would be behind him. We would\r\nvote him what money he wants, and we would go further, for we would\r\noffer him ourselves--if the country was in danger. [Cries of \"But it\r\nis!\"] He has not persuaded me that it is, and he has not persuaded\r\nhonorable friends with me that it is.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly certain that when the light honorable gentleman's speech\r\ngets into cold print tomorrow he will not persuade a large section of\r\nthe country. If the nation's honor were in danger we would be with them.\r\nThere has been no crime committed by statesmen of this character without\r\nthose statesmen appealing to the nation's honor.\r\n\r\nWe went into the Crimean war because of our honor; we rushed into the\r\nSouth African war because of our honor, and the right honorable\r\ngentleman is appealing to us today because of our honor.\r\n\r\nIf the right honorable gentleman would come to us and say that a small\r\nEuropean nationality like Belgium is in danger [cries of \"It is\r\ninvaded!\"] and would assure us that he is going to confine the conflict\r\nto that quarter, then we will support him. But what is the use of\r\ntalking about going to the aid of Belgium when you are really going\r\ninto a European war which will not leave the map of Europe as it was\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman said nothing about Russia. We want to know\r\nabout that and try and find out what is going to happen after this is\r\nall over. We are not going to go blindly into this conflict without\r\nhaving at least some rough idea of what is going to happen afterward.\r\n\r\nAt all events, so far as France is concerned, we can say solemnly and\r\ndefinitely that no such friendship as is described by the right\r\nhonorable gentleman between one nation and another can ever justify one\r\nof those nations going into war on behalf of the other.\r\n\r\nIf France is really in danger, if as the result of all this we are going\r\nto have the power, civilization and genius of France removed in European\r\nhistory, let the right honorable gentleman say so. It is an absolutely\r\nimpossible conception.\r\n\r\nSo far as we are concerned, whatever attacks may be made upon us,\r\nwhatever may be said about us, we will take the action that he will take\r\nby saying that this country ought to have remained neutral [Labor\r\ncheers] because in the deepest parts of our hearts we believe that that\r\nwas right and that that alone was consistent with the honor of the\r\ncountry and the traditions of the party that are now in office.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. MACDONALD REPENTS.\r\n\r\nBut Does Not Recant--Accusation of The London Times.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that while Mr. Macdonald has never withdrawn his\r\naccusations of bad faith against the Government--while he allows them\r\nstill to be circulated as a broadsheet--he ventures to pose as having\r\nabandoned them. Belgian neutrality was, he said in The Labour Leader,\r\nand in effect in the House of Commons also, being used as an excuse--it\r\nwas \"a pretty game of hypocrisy.\" But writing in The Leicester Daily\r\nPost on Sept. 24 in vindication of his attitude he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     On one point I wish to be quite clear.... We could not afford,\r\n     either from the point of view of honor or of interest, to see\r\n     Germany occupy Belgium. The war that comes nearest having a Divine\r\n     justification is the war in which a great and mighty State engages\r\n     to protect a small nation. From that position I have never receded.\r\n     In the controversies that have been raised I have doubted whether,\r\n     when our diplomacy is judged with the whole of the facts before the\r\n     judges, it will come well out of its trial on this point, but that\r\n     when the popular sentiment of the country is judged it will come\r\n     out clean and fine, so far as Belgium is concerned, I am quite\r\n     convinced.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the man who charges the Government with dragging the country\r\ninto war because it would not acquiesce in the German armies marching\r\nthrough Belgium on the condition that the integrity and independence of\r\nBelgium were respected!\r\n\r\nAnd will it be believed that Mr. Macdonald, whose indictment of the\r\nGovernment for deliberately dragging us into an unnecessary war is still\r\nin circulation, has actually ventured to associate himself with the\r\nrecruiting movement?\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons on Aug. 3 Mr. Macdonald predicted that Sir\r\nEdward Grey's statement \"would not persuade a large section of the\r\ncountry.\" That prediction having been falsified, it has been necessary\r\nfor the prophet to hedge. So when a recruiting meeting was held in\r\nLeicester on Sept. 11, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald wrote a letter to the Mayor\r\nexpressing his regret that he could not be present, and saying:\r\n\r\n     Victory must be ours. England is not played out. Her mission is not\r\n     accomplished. She can, if she would, take the place of esteemed\r\n     honor among the democracies of the world, and if peace is to come\r\n     with healing on her wings the democracies of Europe must be her\r\n     guardians. There should be no doubt about that.... History will in\r\n     due time apportion the praise and the blame, but the young men of\r\n     the country must, for the moment, settle the immediate issue of\r\n     victory. Let them do it in the spirit of the brave men who have\r\n     crowned our country with honor in the times that are gone....\r\n     Should, an opportunity arise to enable me to appeal to the pure\r\n     love of country ... I shall gladly take that opportunity. If need\r\n     be, I shall make it for myself. I want the serious men of the trade\r\n     union, the brotherhood, and similar movements to face their duty.\r\n     To such men it is enough to say \"England has need of you.\"\r\n\r\nThus the man who is doing his best to enfeeble sympathy abroad for his\r\ncountry's cause, by representing that cause as one based on hypocrisy,\r\nis at the same time exhorting his fellow-countrymen to make the\r\nhypocrisy victorious!\r\n\r\nClearly, when the officials of the Berlin news department described Mr.\r\nRamsay Macdonald as \"Ramsay and Macdonald\" they were not so ill-informed\r\nas at first appeared.\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Macdonald is not two persons, he has at least two voices.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *",
