Thus, Raphael, Titian, and Giulio\r\nRomano, and not Santi, Vecelli, and Pippi, are the names which we shall\r\nuse in this book. Special attention is drawn to the fact that the\r\nofficial attributions of a certain number of the pictures, mainly of\r\nthe Italian schools, and notably several by Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nand Titian, are not accepted by us.\r\n\r\nThe authors of any critical book on a large national collection which\r\nincludes several hundred Italian paintings of varying importance\r\nmust of necessity be under heavy obligations to Mr. Berenson, whose\r\nscholarly, scientific, and constructive criticism, following on that of\r\nMorelli, has entirely revolutionised the study of Italian art.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in many instances the dates used in these\r\npages do not coincide with those given in the official Catalogues and\r\nrepeated in a large number of text-books, while in a few cases it has\r\nbeen thought desirable to draw the attention of the student to the\r\nquestionable accuracy of some of the titles and “pedigrees.”\r\n\r\nThe illustrations which have been selected represent, as far as\r\npossible, the whole range of the art of each country and school\r\ncomprised within the limits of the fifteenth to the nineteenth\r\ncenturies. The Plates are arranged in the order in which reference is\r\nmade to them in the text, but it has been found impossible to place\r\nthem opposite the pages on which the critical remarks are given.\r\n\r\nIn the descriptions of the pictures the terms _right_ and _left_ are\r\nused in reference to the right and left of the spectator, unless\r\nthe text obviously implies the contrary. Moreover, in the titles of\r\npictures containing the Madonna and several Saints, the names of the\r\nSaints are given in the order they occupy in the composition regarded\r\nfrom left to right. The titles we have used are descriptive rather than\r\nmere translations of those contained in the official Catalogue. The\r\nofficial numbers are those marked in large figures and placed at the\r\ntop of the frames; the numbers in small figures affixed to the bottom\r\nleft corner of some of the frames are obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe surface measures of the pictures are for convenience given in feet\r\nand inches as well as in metres, the height preceding the width. The\r\ntechnical conditions as to panel or canvas and tempera or oil are also\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nMost of the Rooms containing pictures are open:—\r\n\r\n  1. On Sundays all the year round, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\r\n\r\n  2. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from April 1 to\r\n      September 30, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\r\n\r\n  3. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from October 1\r\n      to March 31, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\r\n\r\n  4. On Thursdays in the Summer Months, 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., and in the\r\n      Winter Months, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.\r\n\r\n  5. Rooms IX.-XIII., which contain French pictures and Rooms\r\n      XIX.-XXXV., which contain Flemish and Dutch pictures are not open\r\n      before eleven o’clock.\r\n\r\n  6. The Louvre is closed on Mondays all the year round, and on\r\n      January 1, July 14, and Ascension Day; it is also closed on the\r\n      Feast of the Assumption (August 15), All Saints Day (November 1),\r\n      and Christmas Day, unless these last three days fall on a Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n

In the limited space at our disposal we can only\r\ntouch lightly upon the historical events, the sociological causes,\r\nthe grandeur of royalty, and the taste of the people, all of which\r\ncontributed towards bringing about the formation of the great Musée\r\nNational du Louvre as we now know it. It has been our endeavour to\r\nthrow into prominent relief the outstanding features in the history\r\nof the Gallery and to sketch them in chronological order. The\r\narchitectural claims of the building, its priceless collections of\r\nstatuary and of _objets d’art_ of every age do not here immediately\r\nconcern us; it is to the formation of the superb collection of\r\npaintings that we primarily desire to call our readers’ attention.\r\n\r\nA small part of the building which is to-day known as the Louvre was\r\nfirst occupied as a royal residence by Philippe-Auguste (reigned\r\n1180-1223), who converted a hunting-seat of the early French kings on\r\nthis site into a feudal fortress with a strong _donjon_ or keep, the\r\nexact plan of which may still be traced by the white line marked since\r\n1868 on the pavement in the southwest corner of the old courtyard.\r\nCharles v. (reigned 1364-80), who may be regarded as the first royal\r\ncollector of art treasures in France, greatly enlarged the building\r\nof the Old Louvre as a residential palace; he is also said to have\r\ndecorated the building with statues and paintings which have long\r\nsince disappeared. The real foundations of the collection of _la\r\nmaison du Roi_ were laid by François I. (reigned 1515-47), who during\r\nhis Italian campaigns acquired a respect for art that proved to be an\r\nhonour to his taste and a dowry for his country. The æsthetic movement\r\nhad developed rapidly by 1541, when he laid the foundations of the\r\npresent palace[2] and had already begun to form a collection of easel\r\npictures. François I. invited to his court the master-painter Leonardo\r\nda Vinci (1452-1519), who in 1516 left his native land for France,\r\nwhere he did the king little more than the compliment of dying in his\r\nrealm, although not, as an unveracious tradition recounts, in his arms.\r\nAndrea del Sarto (1486-1531) was also employed at the French court,\r\nat which he arrived in 1518. Giovanni Battista Rosso (1494-1541), a\r\npainter of little genius but great ability, was summoned by François\r\nI. in 1530 to decorate the Château at Fontainebleau. Benvenuto Cellini\r\n(1500-71), the Florentine goldsmith, having “determined to seek another\r\ncountry and better luck,” was yet one more artist who set out for\r\nFrance, where, between 1540 and 1544, he adorned the royal tables with\r\nobjects precious in workmanship and material. Primaticcio (1504-70),\r\nwho is known to have cleaned at Fontainebleau in 1530 four of the large\r\nreputed Raphaels now in the Louvre, remained at the French court until\r\nhis death. The strict authenticity of these four pictures—_The Holy\r\nFamily of Francis I._ (No. 1498), the _St. Margaret_ (No. 1501), the\r\nlarge _St. Michael_ (No. 1504), and the _Portrait of Joan of Arragon_\r\n(No. 1507)—does not here concern us. François I. also possessed at this\r\ndate, among other notable pictures, Raphael’s _La Belle Jardinière_\r\n(No. 1496, Plate VII.), Leonardo da Vinci’s _Virgin of the Rocks_ (No.\r\n1599), and the same artist’s _Mona Lisa_ or _La Joconde_ (No. 1601,\r\nPlate IV.), while the art of Sebastiano del Piombo, Andrea del Sarto,\r\nand other painters, Flemish as well as Italian, was well represented in\r\nthe royal collection during his reign.\r\n\r\n[2] “François I. voulant avoir dans Paris un palais digne de sa\r\nmagnificence et dédaignant le vieux Louvre et l’hôtel des Tournelles,\r\namas irrégulier de _tournelles_ (tourelles) et de pavillons gothiques,\r\navait fait démolir, dès 1528, la grosse tour du Louvre, ce donjon de\r\nPhilippe-Auguste duquel relevaient tous les fiefs du royaume. C’était\r\ndémolir l’histoire elle-même; c’était la monarchie de la renaissance\r\nabattant la vieille royauté féodale.”—Martin, _Hist. de France_.\r\n\r\nThe example set by François I. was followed by his successor, Henri II.\r\n(reigned 1547-59), for whom Niccolò dell’ Abbate (1515-71), an artist\r\nof secondary importance, was working from 1552 onwards. Henri II.’s\r\nqueen, Catherine de Médicis, was also a patron of art, being herself a\r\ncollector of coins and medals. To her influence was due the decoration\r\nof the Château of Fontainebleau and the erection of the Palace of the\r\nTuileries,[3] which was subsequently connected with the Louvre by means\r\nof the Long Gallery, now Room VI. Her eldest son, François II. (reigned\r\n1559-60), the husband of Mary Queen of Scots, first converted the new\r\nbuildings of the Louvre into a royal residence. Henry IV. (reigned\r\n1589-1610) enlarged the Tuileries, and almost completed the Long\r\nGallery, which now contains such a large proportion of the pictures.\r\nLouis XIII. (reigned 1589-1610), his eldest son, seems to have taken\r\nlittle interest in the royal collection; but his mother, Marie de\r\nMédicis, invited Rubens (1577-1640) to Paris to decorate the Palace of\r\nthe Luxembourg with that series of imposing canvases representing her\r\nown life-history which are to-day seen to their best advantage in the\r\nSalle Rubens (Room XVIII.) of the Louvre.\r\n\r\n[3] An inscription on a tablet placed high up on the left of the\r\nPavillon Sully records that François I. began the Louvre in 1541, and\r\nCatherine de Médicis the Tuileries in 1564.\r\n\r\nNo complete record has been found of the pictures which formed the\r\nroyal collection previous to the year 1642. To that date belongs\r\na meagre Catalogue of the objects of art which then remained at\r\nFontainebleau, but it is supposed that when Louis XIV. (reigned\r\n1643-1715) succeeded to the throne he inherited about one hundred\r\npictures, the property of the Crown. With his accession a new era in\r\nthe history of art in France began.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, across the water, a superb royal collection had been\r\nformed. Charles I. of England (reigned 1625-49) had begun his career\r\nas a patron of art before his accession, with the acquisition of the\r\npaintings and statues collected by his deceased brother, Henry. During\r\nhis matrimonial visit to Madrid in 1623 he was presented by Philip\r\nIV. with Titian’s _Venus del Pardo_, now in the Louvre (No. 1587).\r\nSoon after his accession he began to collect systematically, employing\r\ntrusty agents to buy for him in different parts of Europe. His most\r\nnotable purchase was that of the collection of the Duke of Mantua,\r\nfor which he paid £18,280 between 1629 and 1632. He is said to have\r\npossessed in all 1760 pictures by the date of his execution. Most of\r\nthem were disposed of at auction by order of Cromwell between 1649 and\r\n1652.\r\n\r\nOne of the most persistent bidders at the sale of Charles I.’s pictures\r\nwas Eberhard Jabach, a native of Cologne, who settled in Paris and\r\nbecame a naturalised Frenchman in 1647. He was an enthusiastic buyer\r\nof pictures, and his collection soon surpassed that of the French\r\nking. It was known to all French connoisseurs, and was visited by\r\nall travellers of note. In time, however, Jabach’s energies as a\r\nbuyer exceeded his financial resources, and when his debts amounted\r\nto 278,718 _livres_ he offered his collection to Louis XIV., who was\r\nmost anxious to distinguish his reign by the formation of a gallery\r\nof pictures which should be in all respects worthy of it. To this end\r\nhe purchased Eberhard Jabach’s collection, paying 220,000 _livres_\r\nfor the 5542 drawings and 101 pictures which it contained. The price\r\noriginally asked by Jabach was 463,425 _livres_. Among the masterpieces\r\nthus acquired by the king were Titian’s _Entombment_ (No. 1584,\r\nPlate XIII.), which Jabach had had the good fortune to purchase from\r\nthe English royal collection for the absurdly small sum of £128, and\r\nGiorgione’s _Pastoral Symphony_ (No. 1136, Plate X.), which had also\r\nbeen among the treasures of the English Crown.\r\n\r\nTo Cardinal Richelieu (1585-1642), who founded the French Academy in\r\n1635, at one time belonged Andrea Mantegna’s _Parnassus_ (No. 1375,\r\nPlate XIV.), the same painter’s _Wisdom victorious over the Vices_ (No.\r\n1376), Lorenzo Costa’s _The Court of Isabella d’Este in the Garden of\r\nthe Muses_ (No. 1261), and the same painter’s _Mythological Scene_ (No.\r\n1262), together with Perugino’s _Combat of Love and Chastity_ (No.\r\n1567).\r\n\r\nAnother important buyer at the sale of Charles I.’s collection was\r\nCardinal Mazarin (1602-61), who acquired several valuable pictures,\r\nbesides statuary, tapestries, and other fabrics. Of Mazarin’s pictures\r\nthe Louvre now possesses Raphael’s small _St. Michael_ (No. 1502) and\r\na _Holy Family_ (No. 1135), which is catalogued under the name of\r\nGiorgione, but it is more probably from the hand of Cariani.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Louis XIV. preferred the pictures of his own\r\ncourt-painter, Charles Le Brun, to those of the Venetian master, Paolo\r\nVeronese, whose large canvas, _The Supper at Emmaus_ (No. 1196), was\r\nnevertheless acquired during his reign. Eight pictures by Annibale\r\nCarracci, all of which are not now publicly exhibited in the Louvre\r\n(Nos. 1218, 1220, 1222, 1226, 1231-34), Albani’s _Diana and Actæon_\r\n(No. 1111), nine compositions by Guido Reni (Nos. 1439-55 and 1457),\r\nand ten paintings by Domenichino (Nos. 1609-10 and 1612-19), also\r\nenriched the royal collection during Louis XIV.’s reign. Nor were\r\nthe great French painters neglected. The four pictures (Nos. 736-39)\r\nof _The Seasons_, by Nicolas Poussin, which had been commissioned in\r\n1660 by the Duc de Richelieu for the decoration of the Château de\r\nMeudon, together with four of the largest Claudes now in the Louvre\r\n(Nos. 312, 314, 316, 317), were obtained for the royal galleries by\r\nthe ever-watchful Colbert (1619-83), who had been appointed Minister\r\nof Finance on the death of Mazarin (1602-61). Flemish art, as seen in\r\nthe stately pictures of Van Dyck, was represented by seven examples\r\n(Nos. 1961-63, 1970, 1973-75). On the other hand, Louis XIV. is said\r\nto have failed altogether to appreciate the work of Teniers and to\r\nhave exclaimed, when some of that artist’s pictures were brought to\r\nhis notice, “_Ôtez-moi ces magots-là!_” Only one of the thirty-nine\r\npictures by Teniers now in the Louvre, the _Interior of a Cottage_ (No.\r\n2162), passed into the Gallery at that date. The almost entire absence\r\nof Dutch pictures is also to be noticed.\r\n\r\nAn event of extreme importance in this pompous reign was the\r\ninstitution of the French Academy of Arts, in 1648, with Charles Le\r\nBrun (1619-90) as Director, the despotic power which he exercised in\r\nart matters bringing about his further appointment as Director of the\r\nGobelins tapestry works in 1660.\r\n\r\nIn 1681 the Crown pictures and other royal art treasures were brought\r\nto the Louvre from Versailles and were temporarily exhibited there,\r\nthe king paying a state visit to the capital on December 5 to see his\r\n_cabinet de tableaux_. We read that the walls of eleven rooms were\r\ncovered up to the cornices. The collection, putting on one side all\r\ndoubts as to strict authenticity, included six paintings by Correggio,\r\nten by Leonardo da Vinci, eight by Giorgione, twenty-three by Titian,\r\nnineteen by A. Carracci, twelve by Guido Reno, and eighteen by Paolo\r\nVeronese. These treasures, however, did not remain long at the Louvre,\r\nbut were “packed up, loaded on rough carts, and taken back over the\r\npaved roads to Versailles,” which had now taken precedence over\r\nFontainebleau as a royal residence; and at Versailles the Court mainly\r\nresided until the Revolution, although Louis XIV. greatly enlarged the\r\nLouvre Palace and planted the Tuileries Gardens. At the death of _le\r\nRoi Soleil_ the Crown pictures numbered 1500.\r\n\r\nThe energy of Louis XIV. was followed by the apathy of his degenerate\r\nsuccessor, Louis XV. (reigned 1715-74), who, however, added 300\r\npictures to the royal collection. The _Virgin with the Blue Diadem_\r\nor _Virgin with the Veil_ (No. 1497), which still passes under the\r\nname of Raphael, was among the pictures which then passed out of the\r\ncollection of the Prince de Carignan into the possession of the Crown.\r\nIt was now a sorry moment for the pictures which, “scattered through\r\nthe interminable and then ill-kept country palaces of the French Crown,\r\nexposed to every injury of time, ignorance, and weather, regarded\r\nat best in the light of old furniture and too often in that of old\r\nlumber, pleaded in vain for respect and care. No public Catalogue told\r\nof their existence; the generation that had talked of them had passed\r\naway; it was nobody’s business to ask for them, and few actually knew\r\nwhere they were. Even the new-comers passed into the same void which\r\nhad swallowed their predecessors.” Some of the pictures previously\r\nrecorded now disappeared completely, without leaving a clue to their\r\nfate. Eventually, in 1746, M. de la Fonte de Saint-Yenne in a pamphlet\r\ndirected public opinion to the fact that these Crown pictures had\r\nfor fifty years been hidden and neglected in “_une obscure prison de\r\nVersailles_.” As a result of this, in 1750, by the king’s permission,\r\n110 pictures selected from the different schools of painting were\r\nbrought from Versailles to the Palais de Luxembourg, where the large\r\ncanvases by Rubens (now in the Salle Rubens at the Louvre) were\r\nregarded as forming a _centre d’études_. Here for the first time,\r\nand for two days only in the week, they were shown under certain\r\nrestrictions to a limited public. In 1785 they were again removed to\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\nAlthough Louis XIV.’s well-known grudge against Holland probably\r\naccounted for the almost entire absence of Dutch pictures from the\r\nCrown possessions, Louis XVI. had the good taste to acquire works by\r\nAelbert Cuyp (No. 2341, _Landscape_); Jan van Goyen (No. 2375, _Banks\r\nof a Dutch River_, and No. 2377, _A River in Holland_); B. van der\r\nHelst (No. 2394, _The Officers of the Arquebusiers of St. Sebastian_);\r\nG. Metsu (No. 2461, _The Alchemist_); Adriaen van Ostade (No. 2495,\r\n_The Painter’s Family_[?], and No. 2496, _The Schoolmaster_); Isaac van\r\nOstade (No. 2510, _A Frozen Canal in Holland_); Rembrandt (No. 2539,\r\n_The Pilgrims at Emmaus_, No. 2540, and No. 2541, _The Philosopher\r\nin Meditation_, No. 2555, _Portrait of Rembrandt aged_); Jacob van\r\nRuisdael (No. 2559, _Landscape_, and No. 2560, _Sunny Landscape_);\r\nTerborgh (No. 2587, _The Military Gallant_); and Philips Wouverman (No.\r\n2621, _The Prize Ox_, and No. 2625, _The Stag Hunt_). Five of the less\r\nimportant of Murillo’s pictures now in the Louvre (Nos. 1712-15 and No.\r\n1717) were also acquired at this period, and the series of twenty-two\r\nlarge canvases illustrating _Scenes from the Life of St. Bruno_ by\r\nEustache Le Sueur were also purchased by Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nFrom 1725 onwards the Salon held its Exhibitions in the Salon Carré\r\n(Room IV.), but after 1848 this room was used only for Paintings by the\r\nOld Masters.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 a Commission was appointed by the National Assembly “to\r\nregister and watch over all that was most valuable,” and on May\r\n26, 1791 a decree was made that the Louvre should be thenceforward\r\ndedicated to the conservation of objects of science and of art. On\r\nAugust 26 of the same year a further Commission was appointed by the\r\nNational Convention to inspect and gather together the treasures of\r\nart scattered through _les maisons royales_. The Convention decided\r\nthat the “Museum of the Republic” should be officially opened in the\r\nLong Gallery of the Louvre on August 10, 1793, and from November 8 of\r\nthe same year the Museum was open to the inspection of the public\r\nthree days in every ten. This, the first public exhibition of art\r\ntreasures in the Louvre, was the foundation of the present institution.\r\nThe Catalogue of this date contains reference to only 537 pictures,\r\nthe greater number of which came from Paris churches and national\r\nbuildings. The inhabitants of Versailles now petitioned that their town\r\nshould not be despoiled of its pictures, “and so be deprived of its\r\nlast attraction in the eyes of the world”!\r\n\r\nThe Louvre was now destined to become for a few years the temple of the\r\n_spolia opima_ which the victorious French army brought home. “This\r\nsystem of levying pictures, statues, and other objects by means of\r\ntreaties, so called, in which the conqueror dictated terms to those\r\nincapable of refusing them, was a dishonourable novelty in the annals\r\nof modern warfare. Disdaining the usages of Christian nations and\r\noverleaping especially the traditions of French courtesy and chivalry,\r\nBuonaparte turned back to the ages of pagan history for a precedent for\r\nhis measures of spoliation.” By the Treaty of Bologna of June 23, 1796,\r\nand the Treaty of Tolentino of February 19, 1797, he became possessed\r\nof twenty pictures from Modena, twenty from Parma, forty from Bologna,\r\nten from Ferrara, while Rome, Piacenza, Cento, Ravenna, Rimini, Pesaro,\r\nAncona, Loreto, and Perugia also had to yield up a portion of their\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nThe first exhibition of this booty was held in the Louvre in January\r\n1798. Here, during the next few years, were gathered together many of\r\nthe world’s most famous pictures, including Raphael’s _St. Cecilia_,\r\nnow in the Bologna Gallery; Correggio’s _St. Jerome_ and his _Madonna\r\ndella Scodella_, now in the Parma Gallery; Raphael’s _Transfiguration_,\r\nnow in the Vatican, and his _Madonna della Sedia_, now in the Pitti\r\nPalace at Florence; Domenichino’s _Last Communion of St. Jerome_, now\r\nin the Vatican; Titian’s _Martyrdom of St. Peter Martyr_, destroyed\r\nby fire in 1867, and his _Assumption_, now in the Venice Gallery;\r\nVan Eyck’s _Adoration of the Lamb_, now dismembered and distributed\r\nbetween Ghent, Berlin, and Brussels; Paris Bordone’s _Fisherman of St.\r\nMark_, now in the Venice Gallery; and Paul Potter’s _Bull_, now at The\r\nHague. “Here was seen the unexampled sight of twenty-five Raphaels\r\nranked together, the great master complete in every period and walk of\r\nhis art. Here twenty-three Titians glowed in burning row. Here Rubens\r\nrevelled in no less than fifty-three pictures and in almost as many\r\nclasses of subject. Van Dyck followed his illustrious master with\r\nthirty-three works, while thirty-one specimens of Rembrandt’s brush\r\nshed a golden atmosphere upon the walls. The later Italians especially\r\nwere magnificently represented—thirty-six pictures by Annibale\r\nCarracci, sixteen by Domenichino; twenty-three by Guido; including the\r\nlargest altarpieces by each; and twenty-six by Guercino, were perhaps\r\nthe most popular part of the wondrous show.”\r\n\r\nHowever, in September 1815, the pictures and other valuable works of\r\nart which France had plundered from her foes had to be given back, and\r\nthe spoliation of the Louvre began. In all, 5233 objects, of which 2065\r\nwere pictures, were taken away from the Royal Museum by the Allied\r\nPowers.\r\n\r\nAn event rare in the history of public galleries took place in 1813,\r\nwhen the Louvre received Carpaccio’s _Preaching of St. Stephen_ (No.\r\n1211), Boltraffio’s _Madonna of the Casio Family_ (No. 1169), Marco\r\nd’Oggiono’s _Holy Family_ (No. 1382), Moretto’s _St. Bernardino of\r\nSiena and St. Louis of Toulouse_ (No. 1175), and the same artist’s _St.\r\nBonaventura and St. Anthony of Padua_ (No. 1176), in exchange for five\r\npictures by Rubens, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, and Jordaens.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice that at this period very little importance\r\nwas attached to Italian primitives, which were, indeed, deemed\r\n“barbarous.” Many beautiful works of the very early Italian schools\r\nwere actually not considered worth the trouble and expense of\r\ntransport, and were therefore left for the lasting glory of the\r\nLouvre. Among them may be mentioned Fra Angelico’s _Coronation of\r\nthe Virgin_ (No. 1290); the _Madonna and Child and Two Saints_, (No.\r\n1114), now officially ascribed to Albertinelli; Bronzino’s _Christ and\r\nthe Magdalene_ (No. 1183); the _Madonna and Angels_ (No. 1260), which\r\npasses under the name of Cimabue; Gentile da Fabriano’s _Presentation\r\nin the Temple_ (No. 1278); the _Coronation of the Virgin_ (No. 1303),\r\nstill officially ascribed to Raffaellino del Garbo; _St. Francis of\r\nAssisi receiving the Stigmata_ (No. 1312), which still passes under the\r\nname of Giotto; Benozzo Gozzoli’s _Triumph of St. Thomas Aquinas_ (No.\r\n1319); Fra Filippo Lippi’s _Madonna and Child between Two Saints_ (No.\r\n1344); Pesellino’s two small predella pictures (No. 1414); Piero di\r\nCosimo’s _Coronation of the Virgin_ (No. 1416); _The Madonna in Glory\r\nbetween St. Bernard and St. Mary Magdalene_ (No. 1482), which is still\r\nassigned to Cosimo Rosselli; Lorenzo di Credi’s _Madonna and Child with\r\nSt. Julian and St. Nicholas_ (No. 1263); Cima’s _Madonna and Child_\r\n(No. 1259); Vasari’s _Annunciation_ (No. 1575), which is now in one of\r\nthe storerooms of the Louvre; the Ferrarese _Madonna and Child with\r\nSt. Quentin and St. Benedict_ (No. 1167), which is still assigned to\r\nBianchi; Andrea Mantegna’s _Calvary_ (No. 1373) and _Virgin of Victory_\r\n(No. 1374); Domenico Ghirlandaio’s _Visitation_ (No. 1321); and\r\nPerugino’s _St. Paul_ (No. 1566). Further proof of the slight regard\r\nin which certain pictures that we cherish to-day were then held is\r\nafforded by the readiness with which the authorities sent two panels of\r\nMantegna’s altarpiece, the centre-part of which is now in the Church of\r\nSan Zeno at Verona, to the Museum at Tours, and parted with Perugino’s\r\naltarpieces to the public galleries of Lyons and Marseilles.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XVIII. (died 1824) 111 pictures were purchased for the\r\nnational collection at a cost of £26,730, but during the reign of\r\nCharles X. (1824-30) only 30 were acquired, £2511 being expended on\r\nthem. An outlay of £2965 by Louis Philippe (reigned 1830-48) enriched\r\nthe Louvre with 33 more pictures, but that king concentrated his\r\nefforts on the restoration and decoration of the Château of Versailles,\r\non which he spent £440,000.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the Second Republic a large number of\r\nimprovements were effected in the Louvre, and in 1848 £8000 was spent\r\non restoring several of the rooms now hung with pictures, which were\r\nfirst systematically arranged three years later. Although the Museum\r\nhad at that period an annual grant of £2000 for the purchase of\r\npictures, special grants in aid were made from time to time, notably\r\non the occasion of the sale of Marshal Soult, pictures from whose\r\ncollection were acquired in 1852 for £24,612. In this way Murillo’s\r\n_Immaculate Conception_ (No. 1709, Plate XXVI.) passed to the Louvre\r\nfrom the “Plunder-master-General” of the Spanish campaign.\r\n\r\nDuring the Second Empire the Musée du Louvre acquired about 200 Italian\r\nprimitives from the Campana collection, while seven years later it\r\nwas further enriched by the important bequest by Dr. La Caze of 275\r\npaintings of different schools. Since 1870, when the Palace of the\r\nTuileries was destroyed, the permanent collection has been increased\r\nby the purchase in 1883 for £8000 of the Morris Moore “Raphael” (No.\r\n1509), which has since come to be universally regarded as a work by\r\nPerugino; while about 300 other paintings of varying importance have\r\nalso been acquired from time to time with Government funds. In recent\r\nyears the national collection has benefited largely by the generosity\r\nof private donors, among whom we may mention MM. Duchâtel, Gatteaux,\r\nHis de la Salle, Lallemant, Maciet, Rodolphe Kann, Sedelmeyer,\r\nGrandidier, Vandeul, and several members of the Rothschild family.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, by the sale of a large proportion of the Crown jewels, a\r\n_Caisse des Musées_ was organised, and the annual income devoted to\r\nthe purchase of pictures notably increased. A year later the _Société\r\ndes Amis du Louvre_, which corresponds to the National Art-Collections\r\nFund in England, was founded to assist in securing pictures and other\r\nworks of art for the nation; by that means the _Madonna and Child_ (No.\r\n1300A or 1300B) which passes under the name of Piero dei Franceschi was\r\nacquired by the Louvre.\r\n\r\nIn May 1900, on the inauguration of the _Exposition Universelle_, the\r\nopportunity was taken to rehang a large part of the collection, and\r\nthe Galerie de Médicis (Room XVIII.) and the eighteen small cabinets\r\nbuilt round it were first used for the better exhibition of a large\r\nproportion of the Flemish and Dutch pictures. Shortly afterwards,\r\nby the death of M. Thomy Thiéry, an Englishman who had become a\r\nnaturalised Frenchman, over 100 paintings, mostly of the school of\r\nBarbizon, became an exceedingly valuable addition to the Louvre, and\r\nfilled a void in the history of French painting in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. During the last two years the most memorable purchases by the\r\nGovernment have been that of Chardin’s _Child with a Top_ (No. 90A),\r\nwhich was acquired together with the same artist’s _Young Man with a\r\nViolin_ (No. 90B) for £14,000, and Hans Memlinc’s _Portrait of an Old\r\nLady_ (Plate XVII.) for £8000.\r\n\r\nThe national collection of the Musée du Louvre now includes in its\r\nCatalogue nearly two thousand eight hundred oil and tempera paintings,\r\nabout four hundred of which have not been exhibited for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EARLY SIENESE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThis school of painting, one of the earliest in the history of art in\r\nItaly and probably the earliest with which the ordinary student of\r\nart in Italy will concern himself, was affected throughout the whole\r\nrange of its history by the influence of the miniaturists. It was\r\ncharacterised by naïveté, and in the hands of its earliest painter,\r\nDuccio di Buoninsegna (1255-1319), strove to realise an effect of\r\nhieratic sumptuousness, its precision and grace being that of “a\r\nsanctuary swept and garnished.”\r\n\r\nThe Louvre possesses no picture by Duccio, who derived his technique\r\nfrom the Byzantine miniaturists, although he modified their methods.\r\nStanding between the old world and the new, Duccio occupied an\r\nimportant position at the head of the school of Siena, which in the\r\nearly years of the fourteenth century set a noble example to the other\r\ntowns and incipient schools of Tuscany. Passing reference may here be\r\nmade to the artistic aims and religious aspirations of the cities of\r\nRome, Pisa, and Arezzo, but it is Siena which stands out pre-eminently\r\nat this early date as interpreting scenes of quiet rapture and sacred\r\npeace, its own social life being bound up in “chivalry, the meat of\r\nthe eye,” and “piety, the wine of the soul.” Both Duccio, who was\r\nfirst employed by the Government of his native city as early as 1278,\r\nand Cimabue, his senior by fifteen years (if we are to accept the\r\nmuch contested records), have alike been hailed as the author of the\r\n_Rucellai Madonna_ which still hangs in the Church of S. Maria Novella\r\nin Florence. This picture was a generation ago almost unanimously\r\naccepted by responsible critics as the work of the Florentine painter,\r\nand those who still advocate the claims of “Florentinism” are loath to\r\ndestroy their cherished illusions. It is not our duty here to bring\r\nforward the arguments in favour of its later ascription to Duccio, who,\r\nwe are led to believe, painted it early in his career, before he had\r\nlearnt to free himself from the stiff gestures and Byzantine types of\r\na former tradition. Duccio, it must be conceded, never quite succeeded\r\nin giving to his compositions that sense of life, character, and design\r\nwhich we find in the works of Giotto, his junior by some twenty years,\r\nwho was the first artist to accomplish vast schemes of monumental\r\ndecoration. Duccio, however, was the bearer of that torch which was\r\nto kindle the flame of religious art both in Siena and Florence.\r\nNevertheless, Sienese painting was destined, almost from the moment of\r\nits birth, to show signs of dwindling into a school of trite copyists\r\nand shallow quietists. Early in the fourteenth century the lofty ideals\r\nmanifested by emotional Siena spread to scientific Florence, and by\r\nthe beginning of the fifteenth century the city on the Arno gave\r\nunmistakable signs of becoming the leading art centre in Tuscany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DUCCIO’S FOLLOWERS\r\n\r\nThe greatest of Duccio’s followers was Simone Martini (1285?-1344), who\r\nwas also slightly influenced by Giotto. Simone, whose _Christ bearing\r\nHis Cross_ (No. 1383, Plate I.) is the earliest Sienese picture in the\r\nLouvre, has been well described as “a reactionary who made a whole\r\nbeautiful world of his own.” In this small picture the colours stand\r\nout most clearly, although the drawing and perspective are, of course,\r\nfaulty. It belongs to a series of which other panels are at Antwerp\r\nand in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin. A _Crucifixion_ (No.\r\n1665) that is catalogued as being by an unknown Sienese artist may be\r\nattributed to Ugolino da Siena (fl. 1290-1320); it would seem to be\r\nthe centre panel of a large and lost altarpiece.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                        PLATE I.—SIMONE MARTINI\r\n\r\n                             (1285?-1344)\r\n\r\n                            SIENESE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                  No. 1383.—CHRIST BEARING HIS CROSS\r\n\r\n                  (Jésus-Christ marchant au Calvaire)\r\n\r\n  Christ, preceded by the executioner, soldiers, and two children, is\r\n  bearing His Cross to Calvary. He is attended by a large crowd in\r\n  which may be recognised the Virgin Mary, in blue robes, supported\r\n  by St. John; St. Mary Magdalene in red, with her long hair falling\r\n  over her shoulders, raises her hands in grief.\r\n\r\n  Painted in tempera on panel.\r\n\r\n  10 in. × 4 in. (0·25 × 0·10.)]\r\n\r\nPietro Lorenzetti (fl. 1305-50) was probably a pupil of Duccio, and\r\nwas influenced by Simone Martini, but Pietro and his younger brother,\r\nAmbrogio Lorenzetti (1285?-1348?), who represented a new movement and\r\nendeavoured to set forth the civic ideal, are not represented in this\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nSimone Martini’s brother-in-law, Lippo Memmi (died 1357?), is possibly\r\nthe author of the _St. Peter_ (No. 1152), a poor picture which is\r\nofficially assigned to Taddeo di Bartolo (1362?-1422). The art of\r\nthe latter is, in the opinion of Mr. Berenson, seen in the small\r\n_Crucifixion_ (No. 1622), which the Louvre authorities modestly\r\ncatalogue as being by an unknown fourteenth-century Italian painter.\r\n\r\nTo Bartolo di Maestro Fredi (1330?-1410), who came under the influence\r\nof Lippo Memmi and the Lorenzetti, is given a _Presentation in the\r\nTemple_ (No. 1151). Paolo di Giovanni Fei (fl. 1372-1410), whose\r\npictures are rarely met with out of Italy, may be regarded as the\r\nauthor of the _Madonna and Saints_ (No. 1314) which is officially held\r\nto be by an unknown Florentine painter of the school of Giotto. The\r\nLouvre possesses no example of the art of Sassetta (1392-1450), who,\r\ntogether with Paolo di Giovanni Fei, deeply impressed Giovanni di Paolo\r\n(1403?-1482). The latter may be credited with the small panel (No.\r\n1659A) which is officially entitled _The Entry of Pope Martin into the\r\nCastle of Saint Angelo_, and included in the Catalogue as being by an\r\nunknown Florentine, but labelled “School of Masaccio.” There can be no\r\ndoubt that this quaint little picture depicts _Pope Gregory the Great’s\r\nVision of the Archangel Michael sheathing his Sword over the Castle of\r\nSaint Angelo_. According to the legend, Gregory had been indefatigable\r\nin nursing the plague-stricken in Rome in the sixth century, and while\r\non his way at the head of a procession to offer up prayer for the\r\ncessation of the plague, saw “the warrior of God” in the attitude here\r\nshown. Gregory, after fleeing from those who wished to make him Pope,\r\nwas elected to wear the papal tiara under the title of Gregory the\r\nGreat. He is chiefly known to us as having sent missionaries to preach\r\nthe gospel in England, having been moved to pity by seeing British\r\ncaptives exposed for sale in Rome, and for his arrangement of the music\r\nof the chants which are after him known as Gregorians. The official\r\ntitle of the picture, on the other hand, assumes that we have here Pope\r\nMartin V., a man of saintly character, making his entry into Rome in\r\n1421 amid the acclamations of the people. He had been elected Pope in\r\n1417 on the deposition of John XXIII.\r\n\r\nBy this time the art of Siena had progressed some distance on the\r\nroad that its religious aspirations and technical accomplishments\r\nindicated, but it soon became evident that the more intellectual aims\r\nof Florentine art were shaping the course of all the painters of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE FLORENTINE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we have begun our study of the art of Italy with a review of\r\nthe Sienese School, which owes its importance to Duccio, the earliest\r\nItalian picture in the Louvre is the _Madonna and Angels_ (No. 1260),\r\nwhich may be accepted as a characteristic example of the type of\r\npicture that passes under the name of Cimabue (1240?-1302).\r\n\r\nGiovanni Cenni de’ Pepi, to give him his full name, has been hailed\r\nas “the father of modern painting.” The Louvre _Madonna_, which was\r\nformerly in the Church of San Francesco at Pisa, was carried off to\r\nParis by Napoleon, but not considered worth the trouble of repacking\r\nwhen in 1815 the Allied Armies called upon the French to surrender\r\nthe pictorial spoils of war. It is known that Cimabue was working at\r\nPisa at the very end of his life, and, although he was engaged there\r\nas mosaicist rather than as a painter, the _provenance_ of this large\r\npainting, which is executed in tempera on panel, has to be taken\r\ninto account in any discussion as to its strict authenticity. It is\r\ncertainly reminiscent of the _Rucellai Madonna_, and shares much of\r\nits character. The painter has repeated, with certain modifications,\r\nthe Byzantine type of Madonna, whose almond-shaped eyes and long, bony\r\nfingers should be noticed. It has been freely restored.\r\n\r\nFrom the same church in Pisa comes Giotto’s _St. Francis of Assisi\r\nreceiving the Stigmata_ (No. 1312). According to the descriptive\r\naccount handed down to us by the unveracious Vasari, Giotto (1266-1337)\r\nwas originally a shepherd boy whose latent talent was recognised by the\r\ndiscerning Cimabue, who forthwith took him as his pupil and taught\r\nhim how to paint, the boy’s genius enabling him early to surpass his\r\nmaster. Although it would be rash unquestioningly to accept this\r\narchaic production as an authentic work by Giotto, it is one which any\r\nnational collection would treasure. It depicts the supreme event in\r\nthe life of St. Francis, when during his vision virtue passed from the\r\nwounded hands, the wounded feet, and the wounded side of the Christ\r\ninto the same parts of the saint’s body. In the predella are three\r\nscenes from the life of St. Francis: (_a_) _Pope Innocent III. dreaming\r\nthat St. Peter reveals to him that unless the Franciscan Order is\r\nfounded the Church_ (typified here by the Church of S. John Lateran in\r\nRome) _will fall down_; (_b_) _The Pope founding the Order_; and (_c_)\r\n_St. Francis, wearing the brown robes of his Order, and preaching to\r\nthe birds_: “Whenas St. Francis spake these words to them, those birds\r\nbegan all of them to open their beaks, and stretch their necks, and\r\nspread their wings, and reverently bend their heads down to the ground,\r\nand by their acts and by their songs to show that the Holy Father gave\r\nthem joy exceeding great.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE GIOTTESQUES\r\n\r\nFour school pictures (Nos. 1313, 1315-1317) illustrate the example set\r\nby Giotto, who influenced very strongly indeed all art-manifestation\r\nduring the fourteenth century, an age when the human body was denied\r\nall intrinsic significance. His profound feeling, gay colour, high\r\ndramatic power, and sense of form mark the emancipation of Italian\r\nart from the rigid formalism of the Byzantine manner. He discovered\r\na style which was admirably suited to the spirit of his time, and\r\ndeveloped for his own purposes a sense of perspective which he employed\r\nwith considerable effect, although he never really found a scientific\r\nstatement of the artistic principles which he instinctively perceived.\r\nHis indefatigable energy and innate genius enabled him to distance his\r\nrivals and to bequeath to his countrymen a heritage which profoundly\r\naffected the art of Italy.\r\n\r\nForemost among his followers, who imitated his mannerisms without\r\nunderstanding the full significance of his ideas, was Taddeo Gaddi\r\n(1300?-1366), to whom are assigned in the official Catalogue the\r\npredella pictures (No. 1302) of (_a_) _The Death of St. John the\r\nBaptist_, (_b_) _Calvary_, and (_c_) _Judas Iscariot_. Taddeo Gaddi, a\r\npainter and architect, was the godson and pupil of Giotto as well as\r\nthe pupil of his father, Gaddo Gaddi. Taddeo’s desire to give suitable\r\nexpression to each of his figures often resulted, as in that of the\r\ndaughter of Herodias in the second of these panels, in exaggeration.\r\n\r\nTaddeo’s son, Agnolo Gaddi (1333-1396), who was described by Ruskin as\r\n“rather stupid in religious matters and high art,” may be the painter\r\nof the _Annunciation_ (No. 1301), in which we see the Virgin seated in\r\na loggia to the right of the picture. The Archangel Gabriel announces,\r\nby the gesture of the right hand, that the Virgin shall be the Mother\r\nof the Christ. God the Father is shown in the heavens. Notice the\r\ngold background and the mosaics of the loggia. The mechanical methods\r\nand uninspired aims of the Giottesques, the artists who worked during\r\nthe century which followed the death of Giotto, are well seen in the\r\nproductions of Lorenzo di Bicci (fl. 1370-1409), his son Bicci di\r\nLorenzo (fl. 1373-1424), and his grandson Neri di Bicci (1419-1491).\r\nNeri is represented by a _Madonna and Child_ (No. 1397). He might\r\njustly be described as a mere manufacturer of Giottesque pictures to\r\norder. He brought art down to the level of a trade, his work being flat\r\nand his colour raw and inharmonious.\r\n\r\nA _Virgin and Infant Christ_ (No. 1563), inscribed “TVRINVS VANNIS DE\r\nPISIS ME PIQSIT P,” is evidently by Turino Vanni (fl. 1390-1398), a\r\nrare artist of this group of Florentine painters. The brief list of his\r\npictures might be increased by having added to it a few panels at Pisa\r\nand Assisi, which are erroneously ascribed to Buffalmacco.\r\n\r\nAndrea Orcagna (1308?-1368?) and his brother Nardo are not represented\r\nin the Louvre, but we have a follower of Agnolo Gaddi in Lorenzo Monaco\r\n(1370?-1425), who is seen to advantage in his _Christ in the Garden of\r\nGethsemane_ and his _Holy Women preparing the Tomb_ (No. 1348A), which\r\nis inscribed “ANNO DÑI 1408,” and was formerly attributed to Gentile da\r\nFabriano. Lorenzo Monaco is officially credited with a triple picture\r\n(No. 1348) of (_a_) _St. Agnes_ with her lamb and a martyr’s palm\r\nbranch; (_b_) _St. Lawrence_, the artist’s name-saint, holding in his\r\nright hand a book and palm branch, and enthroned on a gridiron, the\r\nsymbol of his martyrdom; and (_c_) _St. Margaret_, the patron saint of\r\nWoman as Mother, standing on the dragon. Lorenzo Monaco, who is reputed\r\nto have been the master of Fra Angelico, usually depicts long, slender,\r\nand sinuous bodies. Below this picture hangs a small panel, apparently\r\npart of the predella of an unidentified altarpiece. It does not seem\r\nto be included in the official Catalogue, and has neither a number by\r\nwhich to identify it nor a label to denote its subject or authorship!\r\nThe picture has apparently never been referred to or described in any\r\narticle or book. It certainly represents the Emperor Heraclius carrying\r\nthe True Cross into Jerusalem. The picture appears to have been painted\r\nby Giovanni del Ponte (fl. 1385-1437).\r\n\r\nNeither Starnina (1354-1408), who took the traditions of Early\r\nFlorentine painting to Spain, Masolino (fl. 1383-1435), who is rarely\r\nmet with out of Italy, nor Masaccio (1401-28), who may be said to\r\nhave vitalised Italian art, is represented in the Louvre. Tommaso\r\nMasaccio, the “Hulking Tom” of Browning, gave to Italy and the world\r\nthe magnificent series of frescoes which still decorate the Brancacci\r\nChapel of the Carmine Church in Florence. He imparted to his figures\r\nsuch natural movement, vivacity of expression, free attitudes, simple\r\ndraperies, and excellent modelling that he entirely revolutionised the\r\nart of Florence. His figures are, as Vasari said, “so lifelike that\r\nthey seem to live and breathe.” This series of frescoes was studied\r\nwith enthusiasm by all the great Florentine painters; Leonardo,\r\nRaphael, Michelangelo, and innumerable other artists derived the\r\ngreatest possible benefit from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FRA ANGELICO\r\n\r\nOn the threshold of the Renaissance stands Fra Angelico (1387-1455),\r\nwho was trained in the school of miniaturists and influenced by Lorenzo\r\nMonaco and Masaccio. His life was devoted to “the service of God, the\r\nbenefit of the world, and his duty towards his neighbour,” as Vasari\r\nsays. He regarded painting as one of the duties of the monastic life,\r\nand never began to paint without first kneeling in prayer. His pictures\r\nare aspirations towards heaven, while the figures with which he peoples\r\nhis saintly compositions have faces which show peace, joy, hope,\r\nand communion with God. They are clothed in draperies of the purest\r\ncolours, crowned with glories of burnished gold, but are never dramatic\r\nin their action. One of his best easel paintings outside Florence,\r\nwhere alone his art can be adequately studied, is his early _Coronation\r\nof the Virgin_ (No. 1290). This imposing, if overcrowded, composition\r\nis painted to the glory of God and in honour of the Dominican Order,\r\nto which the painter belonged. In the right bottom corner we see St.\r\nAgnes with her lamb, next to her St. Catherine with her wheel, above\r\nis St. Lawrence with his gridiron, and to the latter’s right St. Peter\r\nMartyr in Dominican robes and with wounded head. In the foreground\r\nkneels St. Mary Magdalene in red, her box of ointment in her left\r\nhand. St. Nicholas with the three golden balls at his feet, St. Thomas\r\nAquinas in Dominican robes and holding the theological book from which\r\nrays of golden light issue, St. Louis (Louis IX., King of France),\r\nand St. Dominic himself—all help to swell the heavenly company. In\r\nthe predella, or lower part, of this panel picture are depicted\r\n_Scenes from the Life of St. Dominic_, the founder of Fra Angelico’s\r\nown Order: (_a_) Pope Innocent III. in his vision sees St. Dominic\r\nsupporting the falling Church; (_b_) the Pope receives, through the\r\nagency of St. Peter and St. Paul who hand him a staff and the Gospel,\r\nDivine authority to found the Dominican Order; (_c_) the Saint brings\r\nback to life a young noble named Napoleon who had been trampled under\r\nfoot by a horse; (_d_) Christ in the tomb, the Virgin and St. John;\r\n(_e_) St. Dominic challenges heretics whose books are consumed in the\r\nfire, while his own book of the true Gospel issues forth unhurt by the\r\naction of fire; (_f_) angels descend from heaven to feed the starving\r\nmonastery of St. Sabina at Rome immediately after St. Dominic has asked\r\na blessing; these two blue-clad figures are among the loveliest of all\r\nFra Angelico’s angelic beings, and perhaps the most inspiring figures\r\nin the whole of the Louvre collection; (_g_) the death of the Saint at\r\nBologna and the passing of his soul up to heaven in accordance with the\r\nvision of the monk at Brescia. This early Cinquecento panel picture,\r\nwhich was formerly in the Church of S. Domenico at Fiesole, near\r\nFlorence, was painted before the Beato went to beautify the cells of S.\r\nMarco with frescoes. It is one of the best of the primitive pictures in\r\nthe Louvre.\r\n\r\nFrom the hand of the same saintly painter are the _Adoring Angel_ (no\r\nNo.), which until 1909 was in the Victor Gay collection, the _Martyrdom\r\nof St. Cosmo and St. Damian_ (No. 1293), part of the predella of\r\na dismembered altarpiece, and the large fresco painting of the\r\n_Crucifixion_ (No. 1294) which hangs on the Escalier Daru. The latter\r\nwas purchased, together with Domenico Ghirlandaio’s _Bottle-nosed Man_\r\n(No. 1322, Plate III.), in 1879 for £1960. The _Beheading of St.\r\nJohn the Baptist_ (No. 1291) and the _Resurrection_ (No. 1294A) are\r\nunauthentic.\r\n\r\nIn Benozzo Gozzoli (1420-1498) we have an assistant and follower\r\nof Fra Angelico. He worked at different towns in Italy, notably at\r\nMontefalco, Orvieto, Florence, San Gimignano, Rome, and Pisa, where\r\nhe died. Although his earlier work reminds us of Fra Angelico, than\r\nwhom he is much more dramatic and much less spiritual, in later life\r\nhe depicts the costumes and life of his time in a more realistic and\r\nobjective manner. His _Triumph of St. Thomas Aquinas_ (No. 1319),\r\nwhich originally hung in the Cathedral at Pisa, deals with a subject\r\noften met with in the art of the period. The great Dominican teacher,\r\nwhom the heathen philosophers, Aristotle on the left, and Plato on\r\nthe right, recognise as their master in philosophy, is enthroned, his\r\nbooks of theological learning on his knees. At his feet, subdued, is\r\nGuillaume de St. Amour, the author of a book entitled _De Periculis\r\nNovissimorum Temporum_, in which he exposed the various abuses then\r\nprevalent among the mendicants. The dramatic action seen in the lower\r\npart of the panel embraces Pope Alexander IV. presiding over the\r\nreligious council of Agnani, and the envoys of St. Louis (Louis IX. of\r\nFrance) who took steps to end the religious conflicts of 1256. A large\r\naltarpiece (No. 1320) representing the _Madonna and Child Enthroned_,\r\n_St. Cosmo_, _St. Damian_, _St. Jerome_, _St. John the Baptist_, _St.\r\nFrancis d’Assisi_, and _St. Lawrence_ in the central panel is also\r\nassigned to Benozzo. The frame also contains seven predella pictures,\r\nand at either end is the coat of arms of the Medici family.\r\n\r\nThe great French Museum, which is weaker than the National Gallery,\r\nthe Berlin Gallery, and certain other national collections in Italian\r\nprimitives, affords us no example of the art of Andrea del Castagno\r\n(fl. 1410-1457), whose compositions are characterised by harsh colour,\r\nhard lines, and crude forms. Nor do we find here any painting by that\r\nvery rare artist, Domenico Veneziano (1400?-1461), who, it has been\r\nsaid, was the first Tuscan artist to work in an oil medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PAOLO UCCELLO\r\n\r\nProminent among the masters who were influenced by Donatello, the\r\nsculptor, and Lorenzo Ghiberti, the first metal-worker in elegant\r\nforms, is Paolo di Dono, generally known as Uccello. His profound study\r\nand ultimate discovery of the laws of linear perspective was enhanced\r\nby the inquiries into the laws of aerial perspective that Fra Angelico\r\nstudied so deeply. Paolo Uccello (1397-1475) was a pupil and assistant\r\nof Lorenzo Ghiberti, who made the bronze doors for the East Side of\r\nthe Baptistery at Florence. He gave himself up to the scientific study\r\nof perspective, the principles of which he was one of the first to\r\napply to painting, thus rendering incalculable services to art. In his\r\n_Battlepiece_ (No. 1273) is seen a mounted soldier in armour with his\r\nsword drawn; on the left are horsemen about to charge with couchant\r\nlances, while on the right cavalry-men are drawn up awaiting orders,\r\ntheir lances in rest. The correctness of the perspective and the\r\njustice of the foreshortenings and the movements of the foot-men in the\r\nintervals of the cavalry mark an epoch in art. This is the third and\r\nright-hand panel of the series of three battle-pictures which Uccello\r\npainted for the Casa Medici (now the Riccardi Palace) in Florence\r\nfor Cosimo de’ Medici about the year 1457, and not, as the official\r\nCatalogue asserts, for the Bartolini family. The best preserved of\r\nthese three large panel pictures illustrating the _Rout of San Romano\r\nin 1432_ is that in the National Gallery (No. 583), while the second or\r\ncentre panel of the series is now in the Uffizi (No. 52). The Louvre\r\npanel is in a deplorable condition, caused by long neglect.\r\n\r\nUccello’s _Portraits of Giotto, Paolo Uccello, Antonio Manetti, and\r\nFilippo Brunelleschi_ (No. 1272), whose names are in this order on the\r\npanel, is a work of considerable importance, as marking an early stage\r\nin the development of portraiture. This picture, which is referred\r\nto at some length by Vasari, constitutes a historical document. The\r\nItalian chronicler tells us that Uccello “was a person of eccentric\r\ncharacter and peculiar habits, but he was a great lover of ability\r\nin those of his own art, and, to the end that their memory should\r\nremain to posterity, he drew with his own hand on an oblong picture\r\nthe portraits of five distinguished men, which he kept in his house\r\nas a memorial of them. The first of these portraits was that of the\r\npainter Giotto, as one who had given light and new life to the art;\r\nthe second was Filippo di Ser Brunellesco, for architecture; the third\r\nwas Donatello, for sculpture; the fourth was himself, for perspective\r\nand animals; the fifth was his friend Giovanni (_sic_) Manetti, for\r\nmathematics. With this philosopher Paolo conferred very frequently, and\r\nheld continual discourse with him concerning the problems of Euclid.”\r\nManetti’s real Christian name, Antonio, is correctly inscribed on the\r\npanel, but is inaccurately given as Giovanni by Vasari and on the\r\nofficial label.\r\n\r\nThe _St. John the Baptist as a Child_ (No. 1274), which hangs in the\r\nLong Gallery, is labelled as a picture of the Florentine school, and\r\ncatalogued as being by Uccello. It is perhaps by Piero di Cosimo.\r\n\r\nWe enter on the first period of the coming Renaissance with Fra Filippo\r\nLippi (1406-1469), who was trained in the best school of Florentine\r\npainting. He was a pupil of Lorenzo Monaco, came under the influence\r\nof Fra Angelico, and was affected by the magic spell of Masaccio, whom\r\nhe must have seen at work in the Brancacci Chapel. In the latter half\r\nof the Quattrocento the cult of love and beauty was rapidly dethroning\r\nthe more austere ideals of an earlier age. Filippo Lippi’s stormy and\r\nromantic career passes into a new phase with his residence at Prato\r\nin 1452. Four years later he was appointed Chaplain to the nuns of S.\r\nMargherita in that town. The year before his arrival in Prato, Lucrezia\r\nand Spinetta, the orphan daughters (aged eighteen and seventeen\r\nrespectively) of Francesco Buti, had, apparently much against their\r\nwill, been placed in the Convent, the abbess of which commissioned the\r\nFrate to paint a picture of the _Madonna della Cintola_. Lucrezia posed\r\nto the painter-chaplain for the figure of the Madonna in that picture.\r\nOn May 1, 1456, on the occasion of the exhibition of the Holy Girdle of\r\nthe Virgin, a precious relic still preserved at Prato, the painter bore\r\noff Lucrezia out of the safe keeping of the convent. A short summary of\r\nthese well-known facts is suggested by the view which is put forward in\r\nthe official Catalogue of the Louvre, to the effect that the _Madonna\r\ndella Cintola_ is to be identified with the _Nativity_ (No. 1343)\r\nin this Gallery. The weight of evidence is against this theory; in\r\nfact, this large panel picture has little claim to be regarded as the\r\nwork of Fra Filippo. One critic has given it as his opinion that the\r\n_Nativity_ was begun by Fra Filippo and completed by Fra Diamante, who\r\nsucceeded him as Chaplain at Prato. Others have attributed the picture\r\nto Pesellino, Baldovinetti, and Stefano da Zevio respectively. It seems\r\nto show the influence of Andrea del Castagno. The official Catalogue\r\ndoes not indicate the _provenance_ of the picture, although it implies\r\nthat it came from the Convent at Prato at the time when it was brought\r\nto Paris by Napoleon. There can be little doubt that the _Madonna della\r\nCintola_ is the painting thus named which still hangs in the place of\r\nhonour in the Municipal Gallery at Prato.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre does, however, possess in the _Madonna and Child with Angels\r\nand Two Abbots_ (No. 1344, Plate II.) one of the best of the Frate’s\r\ncreations, although the colouring has suffered considerably. It is an\r\nearly work, and was painted about 1437 for the Barbadori Chapel\r\nin Santo Spirito. It contains beauty of line, freshness of colour, and\r\nmuch variety in the composition. The cast of the draperies is ample and\r\nthe motives are novel and bold, the Renaissance background throwing\r\ninto prominent relief the soulful and ideal figure of the Madonna. The\r\npredella panels of this dismembered altarpiece, for which Fra Filippo\r\nreceived forty gold florins, are now in the Accademia at Florence. They\r\ndepict (_a_) _St. Frediano deviating the Course of the River Serchio_;\r\n(_b_) _The Virgin receiving the Announcement of her Coming Decease_;\r\nand (_c_) _St. Augustine in his Study_. The _Madonna and Child_ (No.\r\n1345) is only a school picture.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                      PLATE II.—FRA FILIPPO LIPPI\r\n\r\n                              (1406-1469)\r\n\r\n                           FLORENTINE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n        No. 1344.—MADONNA AND CHILD, WITH ANGELS AND TWO ABBOTS\r\n\r\n            (La Vierge et l’Enfant Jésus entre deux abbés)\r\n\r\n  The Virgin stands before the throne holding the Infant Christ to\r\n  the adoration of two kneeling abbots and surrounded by six angels\r\n  carrying lilies.

(2·17 × 2·44.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1457, the year that Fra Filippo’s son Filippino was born, his\r\nhousehold effects and box of colours were seized for debt. He lived on\r\nuntil October 4, 1469, when he died of a sudden and somewhat mysterious\r\nillness. The Frate, who is the connecting link between Masaccio, the\r\nfirst blossom, and Raphael, the full flower of Florentine painting, was\r\nthe master of Botticelli. A small _Madonna and Child_ (No. 1345) has\r\nlittle claim to be regarded as the work of Fra Filippo.\r\n\r\nIn our attempt to unravel the skein of Italian art in this collection\r\nand to sketch its history in strict chronological order we may now\r\nconsider two small predella panels of (_a_) _St. Francis receiving\r\nthe Stigmata_ and (_b_) _An Incident in the Life of St. Cosmo and St.\r\nDamian_ (No. 1414) by Francesco Pesellino (1422-1457). The former deals\r\nwith a subject we have already met with in this Gallery (No. 1312); the\r\nlatter is a new theme. St. Cosmo and St. Damian were wealthy men and\r\nspent their time in doing charitable works as doctors without monetary\r\nreward, and are thus sometimes known as “the Holy Money-despisers.”\r\nAccording to the legend here represented, a Christian was one day\r\npraying to these saints in the church dedicated to them in Rome in\r\nthe fervent hope that he might be healed of cancer in the leg. While\r\nthus at prayer he imagined that his leg was amputated and replaced by\r\nthat of a dead Moor. In this small panel the saints are shown in the\r\nact of placing the black man’s limb on the body of the Christian, who,\r\nno doubt, will before long be healed. St. Cosmo and St. Damian being\r\npatron saints of the Medici family are often met with in Florentine\r\nart. We have already in this collection looked at a picture (No. 1293)\r\nby Fra Angelico illustrating their martyrdom. Pesellino, who studied\r\nthe art of Fra Angelico, Masaccio, and Domenico Veneziano, and followed\r\nsomewhat closely in the steps of Fra Filippo Lippi, can hardly have\r\npainted the small three-panel picture officially ascribed to him of\r\n(_a_) _The Dead Christ_, (_b_) _A Cardinal supporting the Bodies of Two\r\nMen who have been hanged_, and (_c_) _A Cardinal appearing in a Vision\r\nto a Bishop_. This small work (No. 1415), which was formerly in the\r\nCampana collection, has been claimed by Dr. Venturi and Mr. Berenson to\r\nbe by the Umbrian artist, Fiorenzo di Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nThe _Madonna and Child and St. Augustin, St. John the Baptist, St.\r\nAnthony, and St. Francis_ (No. 1661), which is officially catalogued\r\nas being by an Unknown Florentine artist, and has been variously\r\nattributed to Andrea del Castagno, Fra Filippo Lippi, and Andrea\r\nVerrocchio, may be assigned to that nameless contemporary of Pesellino\r\nwhose artistic personality was a few years ago constructed by Mrs.\r\nBerenson under the name of “Compagno di Pesellino.”\r\n\r\nThe art of the Umbrian artist, Piero dei Franceschi (1415?-1492), who\r\nis so well represented in the National Gallery, is not seen at the\r\nLouvre, where, however, a _Madonna and Child_ passes under his name.\r\nThis panel (the official number of which is given in the Catalogue\r\nas 1300B and on the frame as 1300A) was formerly in the Duchâtel\r\ncollection before passing into that of the Duc de la Trémoïlle, from\r\nwhom it was purchased in 1898 for £5200 by the _Société des Amis du\r\nLouvre_. It was recognised over twelve years ago by M. Ary Renan as\r\nthe work of Alessio Baldovinetti (14271499), who, like Piero dei\r\nFranceschi, was formed on Domenico Veneziano, and was also influenced\r\nby the discoveries and methods of Uccello.\r\n\r\nCrowe and Cavalcaselle also had made that attribution before the\r\nquestion was taken up by Mr. Berenson, who on morphological and\r\næsthetic grounds unhesitatingly ascribes it to Baldovinetti. “Compared\r\nwith Baldovinetti,” writes Mr. Berenson, “Piero dei Franceschi is\r\nsterner and harder and more monumental. Piero’s Madonnas have a fixed\r\nand severe physiognomy, massive structure and immobile pose; never a\r\nsmile, never a touch of tenderness.” How different from all this is the\r\n_Madonna_ by Baldovinetti before us, with her “refined features and\r\nher pensive gaze of adoration—a look that unveils her inner life, a\r\nlook that will soon develop into the mystery which we feel in the face\r\nof Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.” Vasari tells us that Baldovinetti\r\nwas “extremely careful and exact in his work, and of all the minutiæ\r\nwhich Mother Nature is capable of presenting, he took pains to be the\r\nclose imitator. He delighted in the representation of landscape, which\r\nhe depicted with the utmost exactitude; thus we find in his pictures\r\nrivers, bridges, rocks, herbs, fruits, paths, fields, cities, castles,\r\nsands, and objects innumerable of the same kind.” A goodly number of\r\nthese are included in the background of this picture.\r\n\r\nWith Antonio Pollaiuolo (1429-1498) and his brother Piero (1443-1496)\r\nwe enter on a more scientific era in Florentine art. Masaccio had\r\nalready advanced the study of the nude, and the influence of Donatello\r\n(1386-1466) and other sculptors had drawn the attention of all\r\nart-workers to the fuller significance of the human form. A more\r\nserious attempt was now made by the rising generation of sculptors and\r\npainters, among whom Antonio Pollaiuolo and Verrocchio (1435-1488)\r\nnow played the leading parts, to impart to the human figure a more\r\nexact physiological accuracy and so give it greater effectiveness. The\r\nadvance made by Baldovinetti in landscape tended also to a more real\r\nsense of movement in a natural environment. The Louvre catalogues no\r\npicture under the name of either of the Pollaiuoli, but a _Madonna_\r\n(No. 1367A) here credited to Bastiano Mainardi was probably executed by\r\nPiero, who frequently worked on his elder brother’s designs.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Alessio Baldovinetti is reflected in the pictures of\r\nCosimo Rosselli (1437-1507). Nothing is officially ascribed to him in\r\nthis collection, but the _Annunciation, with St. John the Baptist, St.\r\nAnthony, St. Catherine, and St. Peter Martyr_ (No. 1656), which is here\r\ncatalogued as by an Unknown fifteenth-century Florentine painter, is\r\napparently his work. It is inscribed with the date A.D.M.CCCCLXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE GOLDSMITH PAINTERS\r\n\r\nDuring the generation which preceded the activity of Domenico\r\nGhirlandaio (1449-1494) (who appears in the official Catalogue under\r\nthe name of Grillandaio) the art of the painter had often been combined\r\nwith that of the architect and sculptor. In time the influence of the\r\ngoldsmith is seen in the inclination of the more prosaic painters,\r\namong whom Ghirlandaio holds an important place, to subordinate the\r\npictorial qualities of their compositions to the gold-worker’s love\r\nof ornamental detail and fanciful jewellery. Paintings carried out\r\nin the goldsmith’s shop thus contained in the action of the figures,\r\nthe treatment of the draperies, and the fanciful head-dresses,\r\nimitations of silver and bronze work. Domenico Bigordi owed the name\r\nof Ghirlandaio, by which he is now generally known, to his having been\r\napprenticed to a goldsmith who acquired fame as a maker of the jewelled\r\ncoronals (_ghirlande_) that became fashionable. This pupil of Alessio\r\nBaldovinetti, who was a craftsman quite as much as a painter, is\r\nto-day best known by the large number of frescoes he painted in Tuscany.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                    PLATE III.—DOMENICO GHIRLANDAIO\r\n\r\n                              (1449-1494)\r\n\r\n                           FLORENTINE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n           No. 1322.—PORTRAIT OF AN OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON\r\n                       (“THE BOTTLE-NOSED MAN”)\r\n\r\n            (Portrait d’un Vieillard et de son petit-fils)\r\n\r\n  An old man, wearing a red robe edged with fur, looks down tenderly\r\n  at his golden-haired little grandson who lifts up his face to be\r\n  kissed. Through an open casement is seen a landscape.\r\n\r\n  Painted in tempera on panel.\r\n\r\n  2 ft. 0½ in. × 1 ft. 6¼ in. (0·62 × 0·46.)]\r\n\r\nIn Ghirlandaio’s _Visitation_ (No. 1321) the Virgin, her conventional\r\nrobes fastened by a morse such as this goldsmith-painter repeatedly\r\nintroduced into his pictures, stoops to greet St. Elizabeth. On the\r\nleft is Mary Cleophas, and from the right Mary Salome trips lightly on\r\nto the scene. As always in a painting of this subject, the principal\r\nfigures are silhouetted against the arch in the background, through\r\nwhich the sky is seen. Characteristic of Ghirlandaio’s paintings is the\r\njewelled architecture which bears the date 1491, three years previous\r\nto his death. The Catalogue suggests that this large picture was\r\nfinished by either Davide or Benedetto, the brothers and assistants\r\nof Domenico, but it is possible that his brother-in-law, Bastiano\r\nMainardi, may have worked on it. The French, having pointed out to the\r\nDuke of Tuscany in 1815 that Florence possessed many better examples of\r\nthis painter’s art, were allowed to retain this panel picture, which\r\nhad been brought in 1806 from the Church of S. Maria Maddalena dei\r\nPazzi at Florence.\r\n\r\nThe delightful _Portrait of an Old Man and his Grandson_ (No. 1322,\r\nPlate III.), which is usually known as _The Bottle-nosed Man_, is an\r\nadmirable study from life. The winsome attitude of the little boy and\r\nthe refined expression of the old man are very pleasing. It is an\r\nincontrovertible, but perhaps not obvious, fact that mere physiological\r\nugliness can in the hands of an accomplished artist be transformed into\r\na medium of beauty. The picture has unfortunately been damaged, notably\r\nin the forehead of the principal figure. The certainty of touch and the\r\ndelicacy of the modelling indicate that this panel belongs to the last\r\nperiod of the artist’s activity, when he also executed the magnificent\r\n_Portrait of Giovanna degli Albizzi_, now in the collection of Mr. J.\r\nPierpont Morgan.\r\n\r\nOne of Domenico’s brothers, Benedetto Ghirlandaio (1458-1497) is\r\ncredited with a _Christ on the Way to Calvary_ (No. 1323). His own\r\nson, Ridolfo (1483-1561), painted the _Coronation of the Virgin_ (No.\r\n1324) in 1503, the date being inscribed on the panel. Mainardi (fl.\r\n1482-1513), the brother-in-law, pupil, and imitator of Domenico,\r\npainted many pictures which usually pass under the name of his more\r\nillustrious relation. This pupil has painted in the tondo of the\r\n_Madonna and Child_ (No. 1367) a morse somewhat similar to that seen\r\nin the _Visitation_ (No. 1321). In this same group of artists must be\r\nplaced a nameless assistant of Domenico. His pictures have been grouped\r\nby Mr. Berenson, who calls him by the descriptive name of “Alunno di\r\nDomenico,” and tentatively identifies him with Bartolommeo di Giovanni,\r\nof whom very little is known. Alunno di Domenico is thus credited with\r\nhaving executed the companion pictures (No. 1416A and No. 1416B) of\r\nthe _Nuptials of Thetis and Peleus_, a pagan subject which suggests\r\nthe advent of the decadence in Florentine art. These two panels are\r\nofficially catalogued under the name of Piero di Cosimo.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LEONARDO DA VINCI\r\n\r\nWe now have to pass from the mediocre artists who worked in the school\r\nof Domenico Ghirlandaio to that great master, Leonardo da Vinci\r\n(1452-1519), whose work in the oil medium can nowhere be studied so\r\nprofitably as in the Louvre. This many-sided genius was the natural\r\nand first-born son of a country notary, and became a pupil of the\r\nsculptor-painter, Andrea del Verrocchio, in whose workshop he met\r\nBotticelli, Lorenzo di Credi, and many less distinguished Florentine\r\npainters. His interests and occupations were so various that a\r\ndetailed study of his life-work reveals him as scientist, philosopher,\r\narchitect, sculptor, military engineer, mathematician, botanist, and\r\nmusician. The _Annunciation_ (catalogued as No. 1602A and labelled\r\nNo. 1265), which in the official Catalogue is now only attributed\r\nto him after having long passed under the name of Lorenzo di Credi,\r\nis doubtless an early work of about 1472 by Leonardo. Some ten years\r\nlater Leonardo entered the service of Lodovico Sforza, Duke of Milan,\r\nin which city he shortly afterwards painted the _Virgin of the Rocks_\r\n(No. 1599). This fine painting—whose virtues are concealed under a\r\nthick coat of chilled varnish—is reputed to have been in the collection\r\nof François I., although it has no continuous pedigree earlier than\r\nthe year 1625, when it was in the royal collection at Fontainebleau.\r\nIt is very similar to the painting of the same subject which the\r\nNational Gallery (No. 1093) purchased in 1880 for £9000. The points\r\nof difference between the two versions are numerous but trifling. The\r\nnimbi in the National Gallery picture were added much later and are not\r\nfound in the Louvre panel, which in the greater perfection of detail,\r\nin the treatment of the foreground and the brushwork, prove it to be an\r\nearlier and more authentic work. A careful examination of the documents\r\nwhich came to light in the year 1893 shows that a dispute arose as to\r\nthe price to be paid by the Brotherhood of the Conception of Milan for\r\nthe picture now in the Louvre, and that Ambrogio da Predis and Leonardo\r\nda Vinci petitioned the Duke of Milan to intervene. It would seem that\r\nthe National Gallery picture was executed in great part by Ambrogio,\r\nwho worked under the supervision of the great Florentine master, in\r\n1494, about twelve years later than the version in this collection.\r\nLeonardo’s greatest contribution to Florentine art consisted in his\r\npractice of the science of _chiaroscuro_, the laws of which he was the\r\nfirst to fully investigate.\r\n\r\nHaving begun his celebrated “Treatise on Painting” and recommenced his\r\nwork on the colossal equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza, which at\r\nthe moment of its destruction by the French bowmen in 1500 had earned\r\nhim lasting fame as a sculptor, Leonardo undertook his _chef d’œuvre_,\r\n_The Last Supper_, at Milan. Executed in tempera on a badly prepared\r\nstucco ground, the painting unfortunately soon began to perish, and\r\nalthough it was restored in 1908 with great success by Professor\r\nCavenaghi, only a faint idea of its pristine beauty remains. The Louvre\r\npossesses a contemporary copy (No. 1603A) of this fresco by Marco\r\nd’Oggiono, which was commissioned by the Constable de Montmorency and\r\nlong hung in the Château d’Ecouen. A similar copy of Leonardo’s _Last\r\nSupper_ was purchased from a grocer in Milan in 1793 for £600, and is\r\nnow in the Royal Academy, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MONA LISA\r\n\r\nWhen Lodovico Sforza was conquered by the French and his city occupied\r\nby them, Leonardo set out for Mantua and Florence. It may have been in\r\nthe spring or summer of 1500 that he began to work on the _Portrait\r\nof Mona Lisa_ (No. 1601, Plate IV.) which officially passes under the\r\ntitle of _La Joconde_. Vasari says that Leonardo worked on this picture\r\nfor four years, and finally left it unfinished. The words of Vasari\r\nmust not be taken too literally. We know, in fact, that Leonardo did\r\nnot work in Florence for four consecutive years during the period to\r\nwhich the Louvre’s treasured picture belongs, but in 1502 visited\r\nOrvieto, Pœsaro, and Rimini, acting as engineer to Cesare Borgia.\r\nHe probably began it in 1500, resumed work on it in 1503, and did\r\nnot complete it until the following year. This would make Vasari’s\r\nstatement substantially correct. The subject of this world-famous\r\nportrait was Lisa di Anton Maria di Noldo Gherardini, the third wife\r\nof Francesco di Bartolommeo de Zenobi del Giocondo, whom she married\r\nin 1495. It is from the surname of her husband that she derives the\r\nname of “_La Joconde_” by which her portrait is now officially known.\r\n(The title has nothing to do with any reference to her jocund outlook\r\non life.) A French critic has shown that Mona Lisa’s child died while\r\nthis portrait was being painted. “Whoever shall desire to see how far\r\nArt can imitate Nature,” says Vasari, “may do so to perfection in this\r\nhead, wherein every peculiarity that could be depicted by the utmost\r\nsubtlety of the pencil has been faithfully reproduced. The eyes have\r\nthe lustrous brightness and moisture which is seen in life, and around\r\nthem are those pale, red, and slightly livid circles also proper to\r\nNature. The nose, with its beautiful and delicately roseate nostrils,\r\nmight be easily believed to be alive; the mouth, admirable in its\r\noutline, has the lips uniting the rose tints of their colour with\r\nthose of the face, in the utmost perfection, and the carnation of the\r\ncheek does not appear to be painted, but truly flesh and blood.” This\r\neulogistic criticism may seem to-day to be somewhat excessive, but\r\nallowance must be made for the drastic restorations to which the panel\r\nhas been subjected from time to time. As early as 1625 it is recorded\r\nto have been in a bad condition. Tradition says that it was purchased\r\nby François I. for 4000 _écus d’or_, equal to-day to about £1800, and\r\nhung in the _Cabinet doré_ at Fontainebleau. Cassiano del Pozzo has\r\nleft it on record that the Duke of Buckingham, in 1625, when he was\r\nsent to escort Henrietta Maria to England as the bride of Charles I.,\r\nexpressed the hope that he might be permitted to take the picture back\r\nwith him as a present from Henri IV. of France, who was with difficulty\r\nprevented by his courtiers from acting on the suggestion. The picture\r\nwas at Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV.., and appeared in the\r\nLouvre for the first time at the Revolution. In recent years it has\r\nbeen placed in an excellent frame of the period.\r\n\r\nBy May 1506 Leonardo had returned to Milan, and there entered the\r\nservice of the French king. About 1508-12 he seems to have worked upon\r\nthe _Madonna, Infant Christ, and St. Anne_ (No. 1598), which appears\r\nto have been in part executed by an assistant, possibly Salaino. This\r\nlarge panel was purchased by Cardinal Richelieu in 1629. A sketch by\r\nLeonardo for part of this picture is in the Louvre (Drawing No. 391);\r\nother sketches are in the Venice Academy and in the Royal Library,\r\nWindsor. The name of Andrea Salaino (fl. 1495-1515) has been put\r\nforward as the painter of the mysterious picture entitled _St. John\r\nthe Baptist_ (No. 1597), which was evidently painted from a female\r\nmodel. It is difficult to accept the view put forward by Théophile\r\nGautier that in this androgynous figure we have “another portrait\r\nof _La Joconde_, more mysterious, more strange, freed from material\r\nlikeness, and showing the soul through the veil of the body.” The\r\npicture passed into the collection of Charles I. from Louis XIII.\r\nin exchange for Holbein’s _Portrait of Erasmus_ (No. 2715, Plate\r\nXXIV.) and a now unrecognisable _Holy Family_ by Titian, but on the\r\ndispersal of the English king’s collection was purchased for £140 by\r\nJabach, from whom it ultimately passed to Louis XIV. It is a Milanese\r\nproduction, but not, in all probability, from the hand of Leonardo\r\nhimself, although officially so regarded. The same criticism applies\r\nto the so-called _Portrait of Lucrezia Crivelli_ (No. 1600). Lucrezia\r\nwas a lady-in-waiting to Beatrice d’Este, and in 1496 Lodovico Sforza\r\nbecame enamoured of her, a historical event which has no bearing on the\r\nidentity of this portrait or on its official, although uncertain, claim\r\nto strict authenticity. It has also been described under the misleading\r\ntitle of _La Belle Ferronnière_, apparently in reference to the wife\r\nof one Ferron, a blacksmith, who had according to tradition been the\r\nmistress of François I., but was already dead when Leonardo passed into\r\nthe service of that king and came to France in 1516. The picture’s\r\npedigree cannot be traced further back than 1645, and the theories put\r\nforward in connection with it are largely conjectural. It is, however,\r\na Milanese production of the school of Leonardo. _The Profile Portrait\r\nof a Woman_ (No. 1605) was also a century ago loosely described as\r\nthe _Portrait of La Belle Ferronnière_; it is catalogued as a school\r\npicture, but is regarded by Mr. Berenson as the work of Bernardino de’\r\nConti. The same critic is of the opinion that the _Bacchus_ (No. 1602)\r\nis “based no doubt on a drawing by Leonardo,” but the Catalogue accepts\r\nit unhesitatingly. It seems to have been originally intended as a St.\r\nJohn the Baptist with a staff, and subsequently altered into a Bacchus\r\nwith a thyrsus. The _Madonna and Child_ (No. 1603A), an attributed\r\nwork, is only an old Flemish copy of a slightly warped panel picture of\r\nthe _Madonna with the Carnation_ (No. 1040A) at Munich. The _Madonna\r\nof the Scales_ (No. 1604), which still passes as a school picture, has\r\nlong been regarded by responsible critics as being by Cesare da Sesto,\r\na pupil of Leonardo. _The Holy Family_ (No. 1606), which was formerly\r\nin the His de la Salle collection, is not now exhibited.\r\n\r\nIn 1516, within three years of his death, the great Florentine left\r\nItaly for the Manor House of Cloux, near Amboise, in Touraine, to enter\r\nthe service of the French king. His right hand was paralysed—he was\r\nleft-handed and wrote from right to left—and his health was failing\r\nfast. The end of that great life came on May 2, 1519, when every one\r\nlamented the loss of a man and a painter “whose like Nature cannot\r\nproduce a second time.”\r\n\r\nThe _Madonna and Child, St. Julian, and St. Nicholas_ (No. 1263) is\r\nperhaps the masterpiece of Lorenzo di Credi (1456?-1537), who was\r\nanother pupil of Verrocchio. He also painted the _Christ appearing to\r\nMary Magdalene_ (No. 1264). The _Annunciation_ (No. 1602A), which was\r\nformerly assigned to Lorenzo in the Catalogue (No. 1265), is, as has\r\nalready been pointed out, an early work by Leonardo da Vinci.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BOTTICELLI\r\n\r\nThe ever-increasing regard in which pictures by Botticelli (1444-1510)\r\nare held is traceable to the fact that they show the mystic spirit of\r\nmediæval times mingled with a fantasy that is almost modern. He was a\r\npupil of Fra Filippo Lippi, and studied the more scientific methods\r\nwhich Antonio Pollaiuolo adopted in his treatment of the human figure.\r\nPainting in an age when poets penned canzones to many mistresses, and\r\nlovelorn gallants spoke in impassioned verse of the great platonic\r\nemotions which stirred them to the depth of their love-tormented\r\nsouls, Botticelli stands forward as the representative of the later\r\nyears of the Medicean age. The mystic tendency of his genius, his\r\npoetic imagination, his highly developed sense of linear design, and\r\nthe charm of his colour impart to his works a delicacy and refinement\r\nwhich distinguish them from the works of his contemporaries, pupils,\r\nand imitators. His fame had long been in eclipse when half a century\r\nago Ruskin rescued it from oblivion. Botticelli, who now has become the\r\nobject of a cult at the hands of fervent enthusiasts, is, however, not\r\nto be ranked as a supreme master. He cannot be placed on the same plane\r\nas Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Giorgione.\r\n\r\nBotticelli is inadequately represented at the Louvre, which possesses\r\nonly two authentic paintings from his hand. Neither of these is on\r\npanel or canvas, but in fresco. He was commissioned in 1486, the year\r\nfollowing his _Mars and Venus_ in the National Gallery (No. 915), to\r\nexecute two wall paintings (No. 1297, Plate V., and No. 1298) in the\r\nhall on the _piano nobile_ of the Villa Lemmi, at Chiasso Macerelli,\r\nbetween Fiesole and Florence, to commemorate the marriage of Lorenzo\r\nTornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizzi. These exquisite, but much\r\ninjured, frescoes were covered over with whitewash until 1873, and\r\nin 1882 they were removed from the wall and sold to the Louvre for\r\n£1860. In the first (No. 1298) of the series _Lorenzo Tornabuoni,\r\nas Bridegroom, is admitted into the Circle of the Liberal Arts_,\r\nwho give a gracious welcome to this friend of all the Muses. This\r\nfresco, curiously enough, is in the official Catalogue regarded as\r\nonly a school picture. The second of these wonderful creations depicts\r\n_Giovanna Tornabuoni and the Three Graces_ (No. 1297, Plate V.). We\r\nsee the Three Graces bringing to Giovanna their gifts of Chastity,\r\nBeauty, and Love, depicted symbolically as flowers. A tragic fate\r\nawaited the loving pair, as Giovanna died within a few years in\r\nchildbirth, while Lorenzo was condemned to death in 1497 for conspiracy.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                          PLATE V.—BOTTICELLI\r\n\r\n                              (1444-1510)\r\n\r\n                           FLORENTINE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n         No. 1297.—GIOVANNA DEGLI ALBIZZI AND THE THREE GRACES\r\n\r\n         (Giovanna Albizzi et les Trois Grâces ou les Vertus)\r\n\r\n  To the right Giovanna, a young woman in a red-brown dress,\r\n  wearing a white veil on her golden hair and a necklace of pearls\r\n  round her neck, advances towards four lovely maidens clad in\r\n  delicately-tinted robes.

The circular\r\npanel (No. 1295), which is still credited officially to Sandro, is only\r\na copy of the _Madonna of the Magnificat_ now in the Uffizi at Florence\r\n(No. 1267 _Bis_).\r\n\r\nAuthenticity cannot be claimed for the _Fragment of a Predella_ (No.\r\n1300), containing the figures of St. Peter Martyr, the Virgin, St.\r\nElizabeth, Christ and the Magdalene, David, St. Francis, St. Dominic,\r\nand St. John the Baptist. The _Scene from the History of Virginia_\r\n(No. 1662A or No. 1662 _Bis_), a cassone front, and the _Portrait of\r\na Young Man_ (No. 1663), which was purchased in 1882 for £600, are\r\ncatalogued as being by an unknown Florentine painter. These have,\r\nhowever, been included by Mr. Berenson among the numerous pictures\r\npainted by the nameless imitator of Botticelli, whom the eminent\r\ncritic has identified under the significant name of “Amico di Sandro,”\r\n_i.e._ “The friend of Sandro Botticelli.” The _Madonna and Child\r\nadored by Angels_ (No. 1300A), bequeathed by the Baroness Nathaniel de\r\nRothschild, is regarded by the same high authority as a copy by Jacopo\r\ndel Sellaio (1442?-1493), a pupil of Fra Filippo Lippi and an imitator\r\nof Botticelli, of a lost picture by “Amico di Sandro.” The unbeautiful\r\n_Venus_ (No. 1299) from the Cardinal Fesch and Campana collections\r\n(which is very similar to a picture (No. 916) in the National Gallery),\r\nthe _Esther crowned by Ahasuerus_ (No. 1643A), and the _St. Jerome_\r\n(No. 1658), must also be included among the mediocre works of Sellaio.\r\nIn the same group of Florentine painters is placed Francesco Botticini\r\n(1446-1497), who worked under and was influenced by Cosimo Rosselli\r\n(1437?-1507); _the Virgin in Glory between the Magdalene and St.\r\nBernard_ (No. 1482) is by Botticini although placed under the name of\r\nRosselli in the Catalogue. Many pictures by Botticini pass in public\r\ngalleries under the more illustrious name of Botticelli.\r\n\r\nFrom Cosimo Rosselli we naturally pass to his pupil Piero di Cosimo\r\n(1462-1521), who derived great pleasure from the painting of such\r\nscenes from classic fable as enabled him to depict grotesque monsters,\r\nstrange animals, and fantastic costume. At first sight it might be\r\nassumed that the _Nuptials of Thetis and Peleus_ (No. 1416A and No.\r\n1416B) were from his brush; but although these two panels pass under\r\nhis name in the Catalogue, they are, as we have seen, by “Alunno di\r\nDomenico.” Piero is represented in the Louvre exclusively by religious\r\npictures, the most imposing of which is the _Coronation of the Virgin,\r\nwith St. Jerome, St. Francis, St. Bonaventura, and St. Louis of\r\nToulouse_ (No. 1416). An unpleasing _Madonna_ (No. 1662) has long ago\r\nbeen assigned to Piero di Cosimo, who is also the author of a _St. John\r\nthe Baptist as a Child_ (No. 1274), which is labelled with the name of\r\nUccello. The two last pictures hang in the Long Gallery on either side\r\nof the door leading into Room VII.\r\n\r\nThe authorities catalogue as the work of Raffaelino del Garbo\r\n(1466-1524) the large _Coronation of the Virgin, with St. Benedict, St.\r\nSalvi, St. John Gualberto, and St. Bernard degli Uberti_ (No. 1303),\r\nwhich is in reality the centre part of a large altarpiece by Raffaelle\r\ndei Carli (1470-1526?), who worked with Garbo and his group.\r\n\r\nThe great French Museum does not possess one of the only three easel\r\npaintings which are now assigned by the safest critics to Michelangelo\r\n(1475-1564), who as a painter is best known for his fresco paintings\r\nin Rome. This collection is, however, fortunate enough to own the\r\ntwo sculptures of the _Slaves_, represented as fettered and overcome\r\nby grief at the death of Pope Julius II., for whose tomb they were\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ALBERTINELLI\r\n\r\nBy the end of the fifteenth century, Florence had become the æsthetic\r\ncapital of Italy, and painters innumerable were plying their trade\r\nwithin her walls. As they worked in close contact and unconsciously\r\nreflected the influences which beset them on every side, it becomes\r\nincreasingly difficult to assign to any given artist the execution\r\nof certain works. The task becomes even more difficult, and indeed\r\nthankless, when one is brought face to face with such a composite\r\npicture as the _Madonna and Child, St. Jerome and St. Zenobius_ (No.\r\n1114), which is officially ascribed to Albertinelli (1474-1515). The\r\nleading authority on Italian art has given it as his opinion that this\r\nlarge canvas, which is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                      MARIOCTI DEBERTINELLIS OPUS\r\n                            Ā. D̄. M̊. DVI,\r\n\r\nwas “begun by Filippino Lippi, who laid in the St. Jerome, while\r\nAlbertinelli was assisted by Bugiardini in the execution of the rest,\r\nespecially in the child and landscape.” Albertinelli was the intimate\r\nfriend of Fra Bartolommeo, whose partner he eventually became. When it\r\nis remembered that Albertinelli worked in the studio of Cosimo Rosselli\r\nwith Piero di Cosimo, who was the master of Fra Bartolommeo and had\r\nsome influence on Filippino Lippi, it will be recognised that it is\r\nonly the discerning critic of wide experience and consummate _flair_\r\nthat can detect the hand of various painters in a composite picture of\r\nthis kind, as Mr. Berenson has done.\r\n\r\nThe _Christ appearing to the Magdalene_ (No. 1115), which passes\r\nofficially as the work of Albertinelli, was most probably an early\r\npicture by Fra Bartolommeo (1472-1517), who, having like Botticelli\r\ncome under the spell of Savonarola, took the vows of a Dominican in\r\nJuly 1500, and temporarily relinquished the professional activity of a\r\npainter. The Frate took up his brush again and, while working between\r\n1509 and 1512 as the partner of Albertinelli, achieved the large and\r\nimposing _Holy Family, with St. Peter, St. Vincent, St. Stephen, and\r\nSt. Catherine of Siena on the left, and St. Dominic, St. Francis, and\r\nSt. Bartholomew on the right_ (No. 1154). It is signed on the base of\r\nthe throne, in characteristic manner:\r\n\r\n                           ORATE PRO PICTORE\r\n                                 MDXI\r\n                          BARTHOLOME FLOREN̄.\r\n                               OR. PRAE.\r\n\r\nFour years later he also completed his Annunciation (No. 1153), which\r\nis inscribed:\r\n\r\n                     _F. Bartᵒ_ Florenˢ orⁱˢ pre.\r\n                                _1515._\r\n\r\nThe introduction of St. Paul, St. John the Baptist, and St. Margaret on\r\nthe left, and St. Mary Magdalene and St. Francis on the right, tends to\r\ndestroy the full significance of the principal theme. Fra Bartolommeo’s\r\npictures helped to emancipate Raphael from the mannerisms he had\r\nacquired from Perugino; they mark a late period in the Renaissance art\r\nof Florence. He lived until 1517, when Florentine painting was on the\r\nverge of a fast approaching decadence.\r\n\r\nEqually influential in the art of this period was Filippino Lippi\r\n(1457-1504), whose tendency to over-ornamentation became more\r\nadvanced in his later years. In his fascinating pictures spiritual\r\nsignificance is at times sacrificed to a love of mere display, the\r\nbaroque flutterings of his draperies and the air of affectation that\r\nhe sometimes imparted to his figures. The Louvre exhibits no example\r\nof the art of Filippino which in its latest phase shows the early,\r\nalthough unmistakable, signs of decline.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ANDREA DEL SARTO\r\n\r\nThe highly technical skill and mellow colouring of Andrea del Sarto\r\n(1486-1531) have long been known in France, where he was invited by\r\nFrançois I. For that monarch he executed the _Charity_ (No. 1514),\r\nwhich, having been transferred from panel to canvas by Picault in 1750\r\nwhen the process was little understood, suffered accordingly. In its\r\npresent state we can get little idea of the former brilliance of the\r\npicture which secured to the “faultily faultless painter” in 1518—the\r\nyear he arrived in France—a very considerable income. It is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                            ANDREAS SARTUS\r\n                        FLORENTINTUS ME PINXIT\r\n                               MDXVIII.\r\n\r\nA _Holy Family_ (No 1515), by the same facile painter, has been said by\r\nsome to portray in the features of the Virgin those of his own infamous\r\nwife Lucrezia del Fede. It has been enlarged, and has suffered in the\r\noperation. Less authentic are the _Holy Family_ (No. 1516), which is\r\nsaid to bear the inscription:\r\n\r\n                 ANDREA DEL SARTO FLORENTINO FACIEBAT\r\n\r\nfollowed by a monogram, and a lunette of the _Annunciation_ (No. 1517).\r\nThe _Portrait of Andrea Fausti_, which is given in the Catalogue under\r\nthe name of Sarto, and described as being the work of a pupil, is held\r\nby some critics to have been painted by Franciabigio (1482-1525), who\r\ncame under the influence of Andrea.\r\n\r\nThe insignificant _Portrait of a Young Man_ (No. 1506), which since\r\n1709 has passed under the quite fictitious title of the _Portrait\r\nof Raphael_, and is indeed still catalogued under his name, is an\r\nill drawn and badly coloured production. It seems to issue from the\r\ninfluences we have just outlined. Morelli regarded it as the work\r\nof Bacchiacca (1494-1557), who churned up reminiscences of Andrea\r\ndel Sarto, Franciabigio, and Perugino. Mr. Berenson has tentatively\r\nassigned it to Sogliani, who imitated Albertinelli and many other\r\nFlorentines.\r\n\r\nAn unattributed Florentine _Portrait of a Young Man_ (No. 1644),\r\nwhich has been enlarged about three inches all round, had at one time\r\nor another been ascribed without much discrimination to Raphael,\r\nGiorgione, Sebastiano del Piombo, Francesco Francia, Ridolfo\r\nGhirlandaio, and Franciabigio! It is apparently from the hand of\r\nGiuliano Bugiardini (1475-1554), a mediocre artist who endeavoured to\r\nappropriate all the conflicting influences that he came under. It has\r\nlong been hung to the left of Raphael’s _La Belle Jardinière_.\r\n\r\nA Florentine painter of no great accomplishment or originality in the\r\nfirst half of the sixteenth century was Jacopo da Pontormo (1494-1557),\r\nwho painted the _Portrait of an Engraver of Precious Stones_ (No. 1241)\r\nand the large _Holy Family_ (No. 1240). The _Visitation_ (No. 1242) is\r\na copy by a pupil of his fresco in the Annunziata, Florence. By another\r\npupil, Agnolo Bronzino (1502-1572), are the _Christ and the Magdalene_\r\n(No. 1183), not now exhibited, and the _Portrait of a Sculptor_ (No.\r\n1184); the _Holy Family_ (No. 1183A or No. 1183B) which was formerly\r\nin the Vandeuil collection is only a copy. Giovanni Battista Rosso\r\n(1496-1541), who is called Rosso Fiorentino to distinguish him from\r\nFrancesco Rosso (Il Salviati), came to work at the French Court\r\nabout 1530; he painted a _Pietà_ (No. 1485), and a _Challenge of the\r\nPierides_ (No. 1486), which are hung among the French pictures. _The\r\nPortrait of a Musician_ (No. 1608), by Paolo Zacchia; the _Madonna,\r\nSt. John and St. Stephen_ (No. 1133), by Michelangelo Anselmi; the\r\n_David overcoming Goliath_ (No. 1462), a repulsive production painted\r\nby Daniele da Volterra (Ricciarelli) on both sides of a large piece of\r\nslate; a _Flight into Egypt_ (No. 1209), by Lodovico Cardi (Il Cigoli),\r\nand Matteo Rosselli’s _Triumph of David_ (No. 1483), are unworthy of\r\ncomment. They show unmistakably the characteristics of the Decadence in\r\nfull operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE LATER SIENESE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already sketched the earliest period of the art of Siena, and\r\nseen how for a brief space of time it dominated that of Tuscany. The\r\ngreater precision of the Florentine technique, and the wider mental\r\noutlook of its artists in the fifteenth century, placed it in the van\r\nbefore long.\r\n\r\nSano di Pietro (1406-1481), a pupil of Sassetta, undoubtedly painted\r\nthe five small characteristic panels (No. 1128-32), which illustrate\r\nscenes from the _Life of St. Jerome_, and at one time formed the\r\npredella of a large altarpiece. St. Jerome, with others of his order\r\nwho run away, kneels under a portico of the monastery he founded at\r\nBethlehem, and is extracting a thorn from the lion’s paw. According to\r\nthe legend, the lion was afterwards placed in charge of an ass which\r\nthe monks employed to carry wood; we see here that while the lion was\r\nasleep in the heat of the day under a clump of trees, the ass was\r\nstolen by merchants. St. Jerome naturally believed that the ass had\r\nnot been carried off by a passing caravan, but eaten by the lion, who\r\nsubsequently saw his old friend the ass in the possession of the same\r\nmerchants that chanced to pass that way again. The lion is here seen\r\n(No. 1130) in the act of compelling, one might almost say pushing, the\r\nass and the other beasts of burden laden with provisions back into the\r\nmonastery, while the merchants flee away in terror.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre does not contain any work by Vecchietta (1412-1480), who\r\nwas architect as well as painter. A _Birth of the Virgin_ (No. 1660),\r\ncatalogued as being by an unknown Florentine artist, is most probably\r\nfrom the hand of Matteo di Giovanni (1435?-1495), who was most likely\r\nat one time a pupil of Vecchietta. Another of the latter’s pupils,\r\nFrancesco di Giorgio (1439-1502), perhaps executed the panel of the\r\n_Rape of Europa_ (No. 1640A or No. 1640 _Bis_), which the cataloguer\r\nrelegates to the lengthy list of unattributed Florentine works.\r\n\r\nFrom these influences spring Girolamo di Benvenuto (1470-1524), whose\r\n_Judgment of Paris_ (No. 1668) passes in the Catalogue as a late\r\nfifteenth century Bolognese picture. Bernardino Fungai (1460-1516), who\r\ntrod in the steps of Giovanni di Paolo, Francesco di Giorgio, and the\r\nUmbrian artist Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, and yet evinced no real signs of\r\ndevelopment from within, is unrepresented in this collection.\r\n\r\nThis rapid survey of the School of Siena shows that it is not well\r\nexemplified in the Louvre. The third-rate painters, Pacchiarotto\r\n(1474-1540) and Beccafumi (1486-1551), will not detain us. Another\r\naccomplished late Sienese eclectic, Girolamo del Pacchia (1477-1535?),\r\nhas been credited with a _Crucifixion_ (No. 1642), but not by the\r\nofficial cataloguer. Sodoma (1477-1551) also worked in Siena. Towards\r\nthe year 1501 other artists of the various schools of Central Italy,\r\nincluding Pinturicchio, Signorelli, and Perugino, visited the city,\r\ntheir advent bringing about an artistic revolution. Before long the\r\nreligious fervour, the delicate ornamentation, the gesso-embellishment,\r\nthe drawing in the flat, and the miniature-like delicacy of an earlier\r\nage became extinct. The artistic glory of Siena was dimmed, and rapidly\r\npassed into a period of decadence.\r\n\r\nAmong the last Sienese artists of any distinction were Baldassare\r\nPeruzzi (1481-1536), an architect and painter, and Matteo Balducci (fl.\r\n1509-1553), to whom we may perhaps ascribe the _Judgment of Solomon_\r\n(No. 1571) and the _Judgment of Daniel_ (No. 1572). In any case\r\nthese pictures belong to the Umbro-Sienese period of Central Italian\r\nart; they are officially regarded as being by Perugino himself. When\r\nall originality had passed out of Sienese painting, Francesco Vanni\r\n(1563?-1609) produced his _Repose on the Flight into Egypt_ (No. 1561)\r\nand the _Martyrdom of St. Irene_ (No. 1562).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE UMBRIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the head of the various local centres of painting which form the\r\nschool of Umbria we must place Alegretto Nuzi (died 1385), whose works\r\nare very rarely met with in museums north of Italy. He inherited\r\nthe best Giottesque traditions, and became the teacher of Gentile\r\nda Fabriano (1360?-1428), an early master whose influence was more\r\nfar-reaching and inspiring than we can to-day trace in any detail.\r\nThe Louvre has the good fortune to contain a precious little predella\r\npanel of the _Presentation in the Temple_ (No. 1278), which is very\r\ndecorative and exhibits a strongly marked appreciation of architecture.\r\nIt is the only separated panel from the predella of Gentile’s large\r\nand magnificent altarpiece of the _Adoration of the Magi_, of 1423,\r\nwhich was seized by Napoleon but was returned in 1815. It is now in the\r\nAccademia at Florence.\r\n\r\nThe _Miracle of St. Nicholas giving a Dowry to the Three Daughters\r\nof a Nobleman_ (No. 1659), which is officially classed among the\r\nunattributable works of the Florentine school, is now considered to be\r\nby Giovanni Francesco da Rimini, while the _Madonna and Child_ (No.\r\n1300A or 1300B) which is officially ascribed to Piero dei Franceschi,\r\nthe leading painter of his generation in the school of Umbria, must, as\r\nwe have seen, be given to Alessio Baldovinetti of the Florentine school.\r\n\r\nAgain, the three-panel picture (No. 1415) which is credited to\r\nPesellino of Florence is in reality from the hand of the Umbrian\r\nartist Fiorenzo di Lorenzo (1440-1521). The collection is not rich in\r\nthe works of the earliest painters of this school, but the _Birth of\r\nthe Virgin_ (No. 1525), a detached panel from a lost or unidentified\r\naltarpiece by Luca Signorelli (1441-1523), gives us some idea of the\r\ngreat power of this influential master, whose knowledge of composition\r\nand anatomy is best seen in his frescoes at Orvieto. Signorelli’s sense\r\nof complicated movement and crowded action mark an epoch in the art of\r\nUmbria. The _Fragment of a Large Picture_ (No. 1527) seems to be imbued\r\nwith his spirit, but the large _Adoration of the Magi_ (No. 1526) which\r\ncomes from Città di Castello, and a _Madonna and Child with St. Louis\r\nof Toulouse, St. Catherine, and other Saints_ (No. 1528), contain none\r\nof the vigorous originality of that master from whom even Michelangelo\r\ndid not disdain to borrow on occasion. Three predella panels (No. 1120)\r\nhave been dismembered from a large altarpiece by Niccolò da Foligno,\r\nand were originally painted for a side altar in the Church of S.\r\nNiccolò at Foligno. In the art of this over-emotional Umbrian, what is\r\nmeant for deep religious feeling is by exaggeration almost transformed\r\ninto grimacing passion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PERUGINO\r\n\r\nNiccolò’s most illustrious contemporary in this school was Pietro\r\nPerugino (1446-1523). Over fifty of the religious pictures of this\r\ninfluential and accomplished master were carried off from Central Italy\r\nby Napoleon. He is well represented in this Gallery. The contemplative\r\nand deeply impressive pictures of his less mannered style are among\r\nthe best pictures which Umbria has given us, but there is a tendency,\r\nnotably towards the end of his career, to repeat his compositions,\r\nonly altering the attitude of a single figure, and so exhibiting a\r\nmarked lack of originality. His early _Holy Family with St. Rose and\r\nSt. Catherine_ (No. 1564), painted about 1491, is a little cramped;\r\nthe tondo hardly provides sufficient space to contain the rather stiff\r\nfigures, and the treatment is unpleasantly conventional. It also\r\nrecalls the art of Fiorenzo di Lorenzo. The _St. Sebastian_ (No. 1566A,\r\nPlate VI.), which is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                    SAGITTÆ TVÆ INFIXÆ SVNT MICHI,\r\n\r\nis a favourite subject with this master, who painted it at least eight\r\ntimes on a large scale, as well as in a miniature now lent to the\r\nNational Gallery by Mr. H. Yates Thompson. The _Holy Family with St.\r\nCatherine_ (No. 1565) is said to bear the characteristic signature:\r\n\r\n                       PETRUS PERVSINUS PINXIT.\r\n\r\nThe _Combat of Love and Chastity_ (No. 1567) was commissioned by\r\nIsabella d’Este, Duchess of Mantua, in 1505, and removed at the sack\r\nof that city in 1630 to the Château of Richelieu, where it remained\r\ndown to the Revolution. The _St. Paul_ (No. 1566) is a very late and\r\nnot very attractive work. In his best pictures Perugino loved to paint\r\na purist landscape with its buoyant spaciousness of view, but too\r\nfrequently his figures are insufficiently dramatic and have a tendency\r\ntowards sentimentality. A very late _St. Sebastian_ (No. 1668A),\r\nwhich is on a much smaller scale than the subject of our illustration\r\n(Plate VI.), is officially catalogued as being by an Unknown Umbrian\r\npainter. The _Apollo and Marsyas_ (No. 1509), which was purchased at\r\nChristie’s in 1850 for £70 by Morris Moore, with an ascription to\r\nMantegna, was in 1883 sold to the Louvre for £8000. It long hung in\r\nthe Salon Carré as a Raphael, but is now only attributed to him by the\r\ncataloguer. This gem of Umbrian art has successively been ascribed by\r\ncritics to Pintoricchio, Timoteo Viti, Francesco Francia, and others,\r\nbut is to-day generally regarded as a very fine example of the art of\r\nPerugino. Two pictures (No. 1573 and No. 1573A) of the _Madonna and\r\nChild_ are by unidentifiable pupils of Perugino.\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent acquisitions is a _Madonna_ by Antoniazzo\r\nRomano (1440?-1508), the gift of M. Lucien Delamarre. The art of\r\nPintoricchio (1454-1513) is shown in the _Madonna and Child with St.\r\nGregory and another Saint_ (No. 1417), while Lo Spagna (1475?-1528?),\r\na pupil of Perugino, is represented by a _Nativity_ (No. 1539),\r\na _Madonna and Child_ (No. 1540), and by three small pictures\r\nillustrating the _Dead Christ, the Virgin, and St. John_ (No. 1568),\r\n_St. Francis of Assisi receiving the Stigmata_ (No. 1569), and _St.\r\nJerome in the Desert_ (No. 1570).\r\n\r\nA mediocre pupil of Perugino and Pintoricchio, Giannicola Manni (fl.\r\n1493-1544), is doubtless responsible for the _Baptism of Christ_ (No.\r\n1369), the _Assumption_ (No. 1370), the _Adoration of the Magi_ (No.\r\n1371), and the _Holy Family_ (1372) which pass under his name. The\r\nlast-mentioned panel was attributed by Villot, apparently without much\r\nreason, to L’Ingegno.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RAPHAEL\r\n\r\nThe majority of the thirteen pictures which in the Louvre are\r\nunreservedly catalogued under the great name of Raphael (1483-1520)\r\ncertainly belong to his third or Roman period, and in many of them\r\nhe obviously received a large amount of assistance from his pupil,\r\nGiulio Romano. It is this fact, no doubt, which has led the compiler of\r\nthe Catalogue to place the “Divine Urbinate” in the Roman school. It\r\nwill, however, be readily admitted that such a classification is both\r\narbitrary and misleading.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                          PLATE VI.—PERUGINO\r\n\r\n                              (1446-1523)\r\n\r\n                            UMBRIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                       No. 1566A.-ST.

(1·70 × 1·17.)]\r\n\r\nAlthough he lived but thirty-seven years, Raphael gave to the world a\r\nvast amount of art treasure. Brought up in Urbino, where his father,\r\nGiovanni Santi, was poet as well as painter, he passed before he\r\nwas fifteen under the direct influence of Timoteo Viti, who had\r\nworked at Bologna under Francesco Francia. Raphael became the pupil\r\nof Perugino at Perugia about 1500, and also worked as the assistant\r\nof Pintoricchio. His art being thus formed on the best Umbrian\r\ntradition, Raphael in October 1504 left Perugia for Florence, and it\r\nwas only at that date that he began to acquire a distinctive style of\r\nhis own. During his second or Florentine period he painted the _St.\r\nGeorge and the Dragon_ (No. 1503), in which is seen the chivalrous\r\nknight mounted on a pure white steed; his lance is broken in his combat\r\nwith the monster, and he is forced to use his sword, while the little\r\nPrincess Cleodolinda flees in abject terror into the background. The\r\nvery small panel of _St. Michael_ (No. 1502), which is a chessboard on\r\nthe back, was painted for Guidobaldo, Duke of Urbino, and eventually\r\npassed into the collections of Cardinal Mazarin and Louis XIV. The\r\n_Madonna and Child_ which has come to be known as _La Belle Jardinière_\r\n(No. 1496, Plate VII.) is rather later than the _Madonna del Gran’\r\nDuca_ in the Pitti Palace, the _Cardellino Madonna_ in the Uffizi,\r\nand the _Ansidei Madonna_ in the National Gallery. It is one of the\r\nmost famous of Raphael’s saintly and ideal Madonnas; the pose of the\r\nfigures is easy, the treatment simple, the colour exquisite. The\r\nlandscape background is poetic in feeling, and conveys the mood which\r\nmakes this one of Raphael’s most pleasing creations. The thin feathery\r\ntrees and the treatment of the Virgin’s hair are still Peruginesque,\r\nbut the superiority of the pupil to the master is gradually making\r\nitself felt. The Infant Christ is standing on the right foot of His\r\nmother. Tradition says that Raphael entrusted to Ridolfo Ghirlandaio\r\nthe task of painting in the blue of the Virgin’s garment. The drapery\r\nis apparently inscribed:\r\n\r\n                         VRB. RAPHAELLO MDVII.\r\n\r\nAfter working for four years in Florence, Raphael went in the summer of\r\n1508 to Rome, where he achieved such a vast amount of work for Popes\r\nJulius II. and Leo X. His work was increased by his appointment,\r\non the death of Bramante in 1514, as Architect of St. Peter’s and\r\nInspector of Antiquities.\r\n\r\nAbout 1515-16 Raphael delighted to paint the _Portrait of Baldassare\r\nCastiglione_ (No. 1505, Plate VIII.), who was his lifelong friend and\r\nadviser as well as the author of _Il Cortegiano_. This picture, which\r\nis eloquent testimony to Raphael’s skill as a portrait painter, was\r\noriginally on wood, but it was long ago transferred to canvas, which\r\nhas unfortunately abraded, the paint having peeled off the hands. After\r\nthe death of Castiglione in Spain, this picture which he had taken with\r\nhim passed into the possession of the Duke of Mantua, and thence into\r\nthe collection of Charles I., where it seems to have been copied by\r\nRubens. It subsequently became the property of a Dutch amateur named\r\nVan Asselen, and was copied by Rembrandt. Later, it was sold for 3500\r\nflorins to Don Alfonso Lopez, a collector at Amsterdam, and after\r\nfiguring in the collection of Mazarin was acquired by Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThe _Holy Family of Francis I._ (No. 1498) was commissioned by Lorenzo\r\nde’ Medici and presented to the Queen of François I. by Pope Leo X. It\r\nwas originally painted on wood, and was forwarded to Lyons on April 19,\r\n1518. During the reign of Louis XIV. it hung in the _grand appartement_\r\nat Versailles, and having been placed near a fireplace had to be\r\nrelined. It then had wings, but they were destroyed at the time of the\r\nRevolution. Although it is very ostentatiously signed\r\n\r\n                   RAPHAEL VRBINAS PINGEBAT MDXVIII\r\n\r\non the edge of the robe of the kneeling Madonna, there can be no\r\nquestion that it was only designed by Raphael, the execution being\r\nwholly or in great part carried out by the master’s best pupil, Giulio\r\nRomano. In the _Sistine Madonna_ and such works as Raphael painted\r\nat this period entirely with his own hand we see that his technique\r\nhad become masterly and his powers of composition had developed to the\r\nutmost. Compared with _La Belle Jardinière_ of a decade earlier, a\r\ngreater knowledge of craftsmanship has been accompanied by a loss of\r\npurity and simplicity.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                          PLATE VII.—RAPHAEL\r\n\r\n                              (1483-1520)\r\n\r\n                            UMBRIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                     No. 1496.—LA BELLE JARDINIÈRE\r\n\r\n               (_La Vierge_ dite _La Belle Jardinière_)\r\n\r\n  The Virgin is seated in a flowery meadow. She wears a red tunic\r\n  edged with black, yellow sleeves and a blue mantle; a book is on\r\n  her knees; her fair hair is confined under a transparent veil. She\r\n  looks down to the left at the Infant Jesus, who leans tenderly\r\n  against her knee and draws her attention to the little St. John the\r\n  Baptist who kneels to the right, his reed cross in his right hand.\r\n  The background shows a landscape containing a small town with its\r\n  church, and a lake surrounded by mountains.\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on panel.\r\n\r\n  The signature seems to be:—“VRB. RAPHAELLO MDVII.”\r\n\r\n  3 ft. 8 in. × 2 ft. 7½ in. (1·22 × 0·80.)]\r\n\r\nTwo years before his death Raphael had designed the large but by no\r\nmeans imposing _St. Michael overcoming Satan_ (No. 1504), the execution\r\nof which on panel was certainly due to Giulio Romano. It was a gift\r\nfrom Lorenzo de’ Medici to François I., the original cartoon being\r\npresented by Raphael to the Duke of Ferrara. This picture, like the\r\n_Holy Family of Francis I._, was originally protected by folding wings,\r\nthe inner sides of which were lined with green velvet, while the outer\r\nwere gilded and painted with arabesques. The two pictures arrived at\r\nFontainebleau in July 1518, having been carried on the back of mules\r\nby way of Florence and Lyons. As early as 1530 the _St. Michael_ was\r\nrestored by Primaticcio and by many others subsequently, notably in\r\n1752. The picture was transferred to canvas by Picault, who received\r\nfor his labours the large sum of 11,500 _livres_, a sum quite out of\r\nproportion to its æsthetic or financial value to-day. It was again\r\nrestored in 1776, 1800, and 1850. It is signed in gilt characters on\r\nthe edge of the Archangel’s tunic:\r\n\r\n                   RAPHAEL VRBINAS PINGEBAT MDXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Demon is not shown, as in the early and small picture of the same\r\nsubject (No. 1502), as a dragon, but as a half-human monster with\r\nhorns and tail. The foreshortening is undoubtedly clever, but the\r\npicture is too instantaneous in its dramatic action. In the course of\r\ntime the high lights have gone down and the shadows darkened in the\r\nmetallic-looking figure of the Archangel.\r\n\r\nThe _Virgin with the Blue Diadem_ or the _Virgin with the Veil_ (No.\r\n1497) is one of at least ten pictures in this collection which were\r\ncarried out by Giulio Romano (1492?-1546). It is here credited to\r\nRaphael. It has been repeatedly restored. A very large number of\r\nreplicas, variants, and old copies of this panel exist. The following\r\n“Raphaels” may be regarded as the work of Giulio: the _Small Holy\r\nFamily with St. Elizabeth_ (No. 1499); the much restored _Saint\r\nMargaret_ (No. 1501); the _Portrait of Joan of Arragon_ (No. 1507),\r\nwhom Raphael apparently never saw; and the _Portraits of Two Men\r\nseen to the Bust_ (which has been called _Raphael and his Fencing\r\nMaster_) (No. 1508). Giulio certainly painted the _Triumph of Titus\r\nand Vespasian_ (No. 1420), the _Venus and Vulcan_ (No. 1421), and the\r\n_Portrait of a Man_ (No. 1422), which are catalogued under his name,\r\nand in all probability the three large Cartoons entitled _A Triumph_,\r\n_The Triumph of Scipio_, and _The Taking and Burning of a City_, which\r\nhang on the Escalier Daru. The _Circumcision_ (No. 1438) which figures\r\nofficially under the name of the Bolognese painter Bartolommeo Ramenghi\r\n(Il Bagnacavallo) (1484-1542) is by Giulio Romano.\r\n\r\nThe fresco painting of _The Eternal Father_ (No. 1512), which is now\r\ninserted over the door of the Salle des Primitifs (Room VII.), was\r\ncertainly executed during the lifetime of Raphael, and probably under\r\nhis supervision. It was painted for the chapel attached to the Villa\r\nMagliana, a favourite hunting-box of Pope Leo X., who commissioned it.\r\nIt was purchased in 1873 for the large sum of £8280.\r\n\r\nFrom the hand of Giannicola Manni (fl. 1493-1544) come the _Baptism of\r\nChrist_ (No. 1369), the _Assumption_ (No. 1370), the _Adoration of the\r\nMagi_ (No. 1371), and a _Holy Family_ (No. 1372), while a fully signed\r\n_Dead Christ supported by Two Angels_ (No. 1400) is by the mediocre\r\nUmbrian artist Marco Palmezzano (fl. 1456-1538). The latter’s pupil,\r\nZaganelli da Cottignola (1460?-1531), may have painted the _Christ\r\nbearing His Cross_ (No. 1641) which is catalogued as an unattributable\r\nItalian work.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                          PLATE VIII.—RAPHAEL\r\n\r\n                              (1483-1520)\r\n\r\n                            UMBRIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n             No. 1505.-PORTRAIT OF BALDASSARE CASTIGLIONE\r\n\r\n    (Portrait de Balthazar Castiglione, ambassadeur et littérateur)\r\n\r\n  He is seen nearly in full face.

At the same time it riveted the fetters of\r\nByzantinism on to the nascent art of Venice, to which it also imparted\r\na sense of intense Oriental colour.\r\n\r\nThe frescoes painted in Tuscany on the lines of Giottesque tradition\r\nand the environment under which its painters worked, in time gave\r\nto the Florentines a sense of line and form which produced a school\r\nof idealists: on the other hand, the colour-impressions created on\r\nthe mind of the Venetian painter by the relics from the East and the\r\nbrilliant mosaics which he saw around him resulted eventually in the\r\nformation of a school of colourists with a realistic tendency.\r\n\r\nIt will cause little surprise that the Louvre contains no polyptych by\r\nthe very early Venetians, Niccolò Semitecolo (fl. 1351-1400), Jacobello\r\ndel Fiore (died 1439), and Michele Giambono (fl. 1420-1462). The\r\nGallery possesses, however, a fourteenth-century Venetian arched panel\r\nof the _Madonna and Child_ (No. 1541) which is attributed to Stefano\r\nVeneziano.\r\n\r\nIn the early fifteenth century the dominating influence exerted on\r\nthe painters of Venice was that of Jacopo Bellini (1400?-1470), whose\r\nsons, Gentile and Giovanni, and son-in-law, Andrea Mantegna, were to\r\nshape the destinies of the school throughout the Renaissance. Jacopo’s\r\ndrawing is seen in its full maturity in the Sketch-book of about 1450\r\nwhich belongs to the Louvre but is not publicly exhibited. Another\r\nSketch-book by him of about 1430 is one of the treasured possessions\r\nof the British Museum. Jacopo had in early life been the pupil of\r\nGentile da Fabriano, who, together with Alegretto Nuzi, stands at the\r\nhead of the Umbrian school, and of Antonio Pisanello (1397-1455),\r\nthe medallist-painter who played such an important part in the art\r\nof Verona. Both Gentile da Fabriano and Pisanello worked for a time\r\nat Venice. Under the circumstances, therefore, it is not surprising\r\nto find that a _Madonna and Child with a Donor_ (No. 1159A, formerly\r\nNo. 1279 and No. 171), which is now justly ascribed in the Catalogue\r\nto Jacopo Bellini, was long assigned officially to Gentile Bellini,\r\nalthough held by some critics to have been painted in the school of\r\nPisanello. The name of the Donor in this picture is given in the\r\nCatalogue as Leonello d’Este and on the frame as Pandolfo Malatesta; it\r\nwould, however, seem to be the portrait of Sigismondo Malatesta.\r\n\r\nFour small triptychs (Nos. 1280-83) from the Campana collection still\r\npass officially under the ambiguous designation of “School of Gentile\r\nda Fabriano”; they may, however, without much doubt be ascribed to\r\nAntonio Vivarini, who remained outside the Bellini sphere of influence,\r\nand died about 1470.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE BELLINI\r\n\r\nThe sunny splendour of Venetian painting reached its zenith in the\r\n_bottega_ of the Bellini. Gentile, who was sent to Constantinople with\r\nthe authority of the Republic in 1479, painted portraits, ceremonial,\r\nreligious, and historical pictures, many of which are on a large scale,\r\nwhile Giovanni was for many years the greatest teacher and the most\r\ninfluential painter in Venetian territory. Giovanni executed a large\r\nnumber of panels and canvases which in the period of his maturity\r\nexhibit a profound sense of dignity, beauty, religious feeling, and\r\nrich deep colour. Most of those which are signed in a _cartellino_\r\n“IOANNES BELLINUS” (in capitals and, of course, in pigment of the\r\nperiod) are authentic works from his own hand. The majority of those\r\nwhich bear what to the unpractised eye might be taken for his personal\r\nsignature, but are only signed in uncials (“_Ioannes Bellinus_”), must\r\nbe regarded as mere studio productions. In the sixteenth century no\r\none was misled by these alternative methods of personal signature and\r\nstudio-mark. Although the Louvre authorities catalogue two pictures\r\nunder the name of Gentile and three under that of Giovanni, none of\r\nthem is from the hand of either of these brothers.\r\n\r\nBartolommeo Vivarini of Murano (fl. 1450-1499) was the pupil of\r\nGiovanni d’Allemagna, who worked in Venice, and Antonio Vivarini. He\r\npainted a large panel of _St. John of Capistrano_ (No. 1607), which is\r\nsigned and dated\r\n\r\n              OPVS BARTHOLOMEI VI[V]ARINI DE MURAHO—1459.\r\n\r\nAlvise or Luigi Vivarini (fl. 1461-1503), the nephew of Bartolommeo,\r\nwas the last and most distinguished painter in the Murano school. He\r\ncarried on the old traditions of Early Venetian art until the day when\r\nthe rival school of the Bellini had become supreme in Venice, and so\r\nhad begun to prepare the way for the triumphs of the Giorgionesque\r\nperiod—the golden age of Venetian painting. The _Portrait of a Man_\r\n(No. 1519), catalogued under the name of Savoldo (1480?-1548?) is by\r\nAlvise. This magnificent bust-length picture represents Bernardo di\r\nSalla, who holds in his gloved right hand a paper inscribed “_Dono\r\nBnardo di Salla_.” It vividly recalls the _Portrait of a Man with a\r\nHawk_ at Windsor, which, although it traditionally but erroneously\r\nbears the name of Leonardo da Vinci and has been ascribed to Savoldo,\r\nis in all probability another of the rare portraits by Alvise.\r\n\r\nFrom the Vivarini group issues Carlo Crivelli (1430?-1493?). His\r\nmorosely ascetic compositions, with their elaborate draperies,\r\njewelled ornamentation, and at times grotesque anatomy, distinguish\r\nhis polyptychs, all of which are painted in tempera, from those of any\r\nother painter in the whole range of art. His large panel picture of\r\n_St. Bernardino of Siena_ (No. 1268) is inscribed\r\n\r\n                  OPUS CAROLI CRIVELLI VENETI, 1477.\r\n\r\nIt belongs to his middle period, and was painted nine years earlier\r\nthan his magnificent _Annunciation_, now one of the gems of the\r\nNational Gallery (No. 739); both these pictures came from the Church of\r\nthe Annunziata at Ascoli.\r\n\r\nAnother painter who carried on the Vivarini tradition but was\r\ninfluenced by Giovanni Bellini, was Giovanni Battista Cima\r\n(1460?-1517?), whose art is adequately shown in the _Madonna and Child\r\nwith St. John the Baptist and St. Mary Magdalene_ (No. 1259). The\r\nsignature\r\n\r\n                             IOANIS BAPT.\r\n                              CONEGLANES.\r\n                                 OPVS.\r\n\r\nas well as the internal evidence of the picture show it to\r\nbe an authentic work.\r\n\r\nOne of the best, but until recent years one of the least known, members\r\nof that brilliant group of painters who flourished at Venice in the\r\nearly half of the sixteenth century was Lorenzo Lotto (1480-1556). He\r\npractised his art in many parts of Italy, and for that reason has been\r\nless generally known than many of his contemporaries. He was a pupil\r\nof Alvise Vivarini, but benefited largely by the example of Giovanni\r\nBellini and Giorgione. His art is not well seen in the small _St.\r\nJerome_ (No. 1350), which is signed and dated “LOTVS 1500” and\r\nmust therefore be one of his earliest and least ambitious works, nor\r\nin his _Holy Family_ (No. 1351) which was formerly attributed to Dosso\r\nDossi. Replicas have been found of his _Christ and the Woman taken in\r\nAdultery_ (No. 1349).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                    PLATE IX.—ANTONELLO DA MESSINA\r\n\r\n                              (1430-1479)\r\n\r\n                            VENETIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                  No. 1134.—PORTRAIT OF A CONDOTTIERE\r\n\r\n                 (Portrait d’homme dit le Condottiere)\r\n\r\n  Bust portrait, turned three-quarters to the left.

(0·33 × 0·28.)]\r\n\r\nAlthough we possess very detailed records of Antonello da Messina\r\n(1430-1479), his movements and his life’s work, it is only in recent\r\nyears that they have been studied with any care. This Sicilian-born\r\nartist obviously cannot have set out for Flanders and there have learnt\r\nfrom Jan van Eyck (who died in 1441) the “discovery” of oil as a\r\nmedium in painting, as Vasari tells us. But he may have seen in Italy\r\na picture by the great Northern artist and from it have acquired some\r\nfacility in the use of oil and in finishing with glazes of oil panels\r\nwhich had been begun in tempera. He was certainly in Venice in 1475-76,\r\nif not earlier, and his _Portrait of a Condottiere_ (No. 1134, Plate\r\nIX.), which is characteristically signed and dated\r\n\r\n                                 _1474\r\n                        Antonellus Messaneus me\r\n                                pinxit_\r\n\r\nbelongs to that period of his full maturity. It was\r\npurchased at the Pourtalès-Gorgier sale in 1865 for £4767. In any case,\r\nthe discoveries with which Antonello is credited within a few years\r\ncompletely revolutionised the methods of painting throughout Italy, and\r\nprepare us for the wonderful achievements of the later Venetians, who\r\nfollowed and improved upon the Bellini tradition.\r\n\r\nVittore Carpaccio (1455?-1526) was, like Gentile Bellini, a painter of\r\nVenetian fêtes, pageantry, and religious pictures on an imposing scale.\r\nNothing is known of Carpaccio’s artistic descent, but his work shows\r\ntraces of the influence of Jacopo Bellini and of Lazzaro Bastiani, who\r\nwas the head of a group of artists whose art was based on the tradition\r\nof such early painters as Jacobello del Fiore. Carpaccio’s _Preaching\r\nof St. Stephen at Jerusalem_ (No. 1211) is one of the series of five\r\nincidents from the _Life of St. Stephen_ which were painted by this\r\nartist between 1511 and 1520 for the Scuola di S. Stefano at Milan. The\r\nothers of the series are now in the Milan Gallery (No. 170—signed and\r\ndated 1513), at Berlin (No. 23), and at Stuttgart. The Louvre obtained\r\nthis canvas, which varies from the others in size, from the Milan\r\nGallery in 1813, when together with Boltraffio’s _Madonna of the Casio\r\nFamily_ (No. 1169) and other pictures it was exchanged for works by\r\nRembrandt, Rubens, Van Dyck, and Jordaens.\r\n\r\nTo Vincenzo Catena (14..?-1531?) may be assigned, on stylistic grounds,\r\nthe _Reception of a Venetian Ambassador at Cairo in 1512_ (No. 1157).\r\nIn any case, it cannot have been executed by Gentile Bellini, as\r\nalleged in the Catalogue, as the audience here depicted did not take\r\nplace until five years after that master’s death!\r\n\r\nAnother Bellinesque painter was Bartolommeo Veneto (fl. 1505-1555). We\r\nshall, following the suggestion of Venturi, assign to him the excellent\r\nbut officially unattributed _Portrait of a Lady_ (No. 1673) which hangs\r\nto the right of Raphael’s _La Belle Jardinière_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GIORGIONE\r\n\r\nAlthough a large number of really representative examples of the great\r\nlyricist Giorgione (1477-1510) have not come down to us, he is to be\r\nregarded as the greatest of the Venetian artists, and perhaps the most\r\nromantic painter that Europe has ever known. He was, together with\r\nhis illustrious contemporary Titian, a pupil of Giovanni Bellini. His\r\n_Pastoral Symphony_ (No. 1136, Plate X.) is one of the most beautiful\r\nidyllic groups in the whole range of painting, and shows that Giorgione\r\ncould naively reveal the inner depths of thought and feeling and\r\ndepict “passionate souls in passionate bodies.” Early in the sixteenth\r\ncentury the austere traditions of the Bellinesque era were passing\r\naway. Giorgione now began to unseal the eyes of his contemporaries,\r\namong whom Titian occupied an important place, to the “life-giving and\r\ndeath-dealing waters of love,” making the landscape background of his\r\nlyrical compositions respond to the mood of the incident illustrated.\r\nThe _Pastoral Symphony_ was acquired by Charles I. from the collection\r\nof the Duke of Mantua; it then passed to Jabach, and subsequently to\r\nLouis XIV. Although it has been slightly restored and has from time to\r\ntime been without any reason ascribed to Titian, Sebastiano del Piombo\r\nand a large number of Venetian artists, it is to-day recognised on all\r\nsides as an excellent example of Giorgione.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                          PLATE X.—GIORGIONE\r\n\r\n                             (1477?-1510)\r\n\r\n                            VENETIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                      No. 1136.—PASTORAL SYMPHONY\r\n\r\n                          (Concert Champêtre)\r\n\r\n  Two young men are seated on the grass; the one, wearing a green\r\n  tunic with red sleeves, a red cap and parti-coloured hose, is\r\n  playing on the lute; his companion bends over to listen to him.\r\n  Before them a nude woman, her back turned to the spectator, is\r\n  seated holding a flute. To the left another nude woman, with a\r\n  drapery across her left hip, is drawing water at a fountain. In the\r\n  background to the right is seen a shepherd with his flock. In the\r\n  centre background are some houses.\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on canvas.\r\n\r\n  3 ft. 7½ in. × 4 ft. 6½ in. (1·10 × 1·38.)]\r\n\r\nThe same influences which formed the art of Giorgione inspired the\r\npictures of Palma Vecchio (1480-1528), whose _Adoration of the\r\nShepherds with a Female Donor_ (No. 1399, Plate XI.) is brilliant in\r\ncolour. The signature in the right foreground of this canvas, TICIAN,\r\nis false. Palma left a large number of pictures unfinished at his death.\r\n\r\nThe _Visitation_ (No. 1352) is an admirable example of the art of\r\nSebastiano del Piombo (1485-1547), and is signed\r\n\r\n                     SEBASTIANVS VENETVS FACIEBAT\r\n                             ROMAE MDXXI.\r\n\r\nIt was purchased in the year indicated in the inscription by François\r\nI., who added it to his collection at Fontainebleau, whence it was\r\nremoved by Louis XIV. to Versailles. The canvas, which has been a good\r\ndeal injured, has at some time been cut into three pieces. The name\r\nby which this artist is generally known was derived from the office\r\nwhich he held late in life at the Papal Court. There he forsook the\r\ntraditions of his native school and gradually came under the influence\r\nof Michelangelo. In Rome he also met Raphael, who was much impressed\r\nby his colour schemes: the _St. John the Baptist in the Desert_ (No.\r\n1500), here catalogued under the name of Raphael, and a few pictures\r\nsimilarly attributed in other galleries, were painted by Sebastiano in\r\nhis Roman manner.\r\n\r\nA prominent place among the less important artists generally included\r\nin this school must be accorded to Cariani (1480?-1547?). A large\r\nproportion of the pictures of this Bergamask painter usually pass under\r\nmore imposing names, and it is a remarkable fact that we do not find\r\nany work attributed to him in the official Catalogue. He, however,\r\npainted a _Holy Family_ (No. 1135), here assigned to Giorgione, as\r\nwell as the _Madonna and Child and St. Sebastian_ (No. 1159) given to\r\nGiovanni Bellini. The _Portrait of Two Men_ (No. 1156), which for no\r\nvery apparent reason was once regarded as the portraits of Gentile and\r\nGiovanni Bellini, must be by Cariani, although still placed to the\r\ncredit of Gentile.\r\n\r\nAnother of the less efficient pupils of Giovanni Bellini was Niccolò\r\nRondinelli (fl. 1480-1500), whose _Madonna and Child, St. Peter, and\r\nSt. Sebastian_ (No. 1158) masquerades as a work by Giovanni Bellini,\r\nwhose full name, IOANNES BELLINVS, is inscribed in capitals (not,\r\nhowever, placed in a _cartellino_) on the parapet which runs across the\r\nfront of the panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TITIAN\r\n\r\nAlthough we have only limited space to deal with the differences of\r\nthe critics as to the probable date of Titian’s birth, we may point\r\nout that it was, until recent times, placed in the year 1477. Mr.\r\nHerbert Cook has, however, put forward a very strong case in favour\r\nof the year 1489, pointing out the remarkable fact that there is no\r\nrecord of Titian earlier than Dec. 2, 1511, or, according to the usual\r\nchronology, until he was thirty-five years of age! Again, L. Dolce, in\r\n1557, wrote that Titian was “scarcely twenty years old when Giorgione\r\nwas painting the façade of the Fondaco de’ Tedeschi”; and we know that\r\nTitian was his assistant on that work in 1507-8. Vasari also\r\nasserts, as Mr. Cook reminds us, that the famous Venetian was “about\r\nseventy-six years old in 1566-67,” when he visited him in Venice. No\r\nreliance is to be placed on the date contained in the well-known letter\r\nwhich Titian addressed to Philip II. in 1571, as he evidently had a\r\nmotive in referring to himself as “an old servant of ninety-five.”\r\nThere is, however, no doubt that Titian died in 1576.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                        PLATE XI.—PALMA VECCHIO\r\n\r\n                              (1480-1528)\r\n\r\n                            VENETIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n     No. 1399.—THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS, WITH A FEMALE DONOR\r\n\r\n                        (L’Annonce aux Bergers)\r\n\r\n  The Virgin is seated and holds the Infant Jesus on a cradle formed\r\n  of basket-work; she wears a red robe with blue and green draperies\r\n  and a white veil, under which her brown hair is seen.

(1·40 × 2·10.)]\r\n\r\nTitian, who was a native of Cadore, left his home at an early age\r\nfor Venice. He was first placed as a pupil of Sebastian Zuccato, a\r\nmosaicist and perhaps a painter; he then seems to have worked in the\r\nstudio of Gentile Bellini before passing into that of Giovanni, where\r\nhe met Giorgione. Titian, like Giotto, has been called “the Father of\r\nmodern painting.” The early Florentine had provided his countrymen\r\nwith a set of fundamental principles of art, but it remained for\r\nthe illustrious Venetian to endow his contemporaries and artistic\r\ndescendants with a more complete equipment and a new sense of pictorial\r\neffect. The profound impression exerted by Giorgione on the youthful\r\nTitian inspired him to achieve those idyllic compositions and “poesies”\r\nwhich stand out so prominently among the world’s pictures.\r\n\r\nTitian’s earliest picture in the Louvre is the _Virgin and Child,\r\nwith St. Stephen, St. Ambrose, and St. Maurice_ (No. 1577), of about\r\n1508-1510. It is very reminiscent of a picture by Titian in the Vienna\r\nGallery (No. 166), in which he has substituted St. Jerome for St.\r\nAmbrose.\r\n\r\nNo doubt can exist as to the authenticity of the so-called _Portrait\r\nof Alfonso da Ferrara and Laura de’ Dianti_ (No. 1590), but the title\r\nunder which it has passed for many years is probably incorrect.\r\nIt was in the collection of Charles I., and was then described as\r\n“Tytsian’s Mrs., after the life by Tytsian.” In the collection of\r\nJabach it was called _La Maîtresse du Titien_, and as such was sold\r\nto Louis XIV. for £100. This picture would correctly be described\r\nunder the less ambitious title of _A Woman at her Toilet and a Man\r\nholding Two Mirrors_. Laura was the daughter of a hatter of Ferrara.\r\nShe was _persona grata_ at the court of Alfonso I., Duke of Ferrara\r\n(reigned 1505-1534), and there held the title of _Illustrissima Donna\r\nLaura Eustochia d’Este_. The Duke’s first wife, Anna Sforza, died in\r\n1497, when he was twenty-one years old. In 1501 he married, as his\r\nsecond wife, Lucrezia Borgia (died 1519), the natural daughter of Pope\r\nAlexander VI. It seems probable that shortly afterwards the Duke took\r\nLaura as his third wife, and that she was painted by Titian a little\r\nlater. The Louvre picture (No. 1590) appears on stylistic grounds to\r\nbe a work of about 1515-1517. A portrait which can be more certainly\r\nidentified as that of Laura is the single figure picture, painted by\r\nTitian about 1523, in the collection of Sir Frederick Cook at Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Giorgione is still clearly seen in Titian’s _Man with\r\na Glove_ (No. 1592, Plate XII.). It is a noble portrait of an unknown\r\nman; the colour is rich, and the light and shade are contrasted with\r\ngreat mastery; the bare right hand and the gloved left holding the\r\nsecond glove are admirably modelled. The canvas, which seems to have\r\nbeen painted about 1518, is signed “TICIANVS F.” Soon afterwards Titian\r\nmust have painted the _Portrait of a Man in Black with the Thumb of\r\nhis Left Hand in the Belt of his Doublet_ (No. 1591), the _Madonna\r\nwith the Rabbit_ (No. 1578), which is inscribed _Ticianus F._, and\r\nthe magnificent _Entombment_ (No. 1584, Plate XIII.). This priceless\r\npicture, which was painted not later, than 1523 for Federigo Gonzaga,\r\npassed from Mantua into the collection of Charles I. It was sold off by\r\nCromwell for £128 and, after being one of the masterpieces for a few\r\nyears in the collection of Jabach, was acquired by Louis XIV. The deep\r\nreligious feeling and the rich, sonorous harmony of colour make this\r\none of the world’s most precious pictures. Notice the sunburnt arm\r\nof Joseph of Arimathæa; it is significant of the art of Venice.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                           PLATE XII.—TITIAN\r\n\r\n                             (1489?-1576)\r\n\r\n                            VENETIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                    No. 1592.—THE MAN WITH A GLOVE\r\n\r\n                           (L’homme au Gant)\r\n\r\n  He is standing and seen nearly in full face, the head turned\r\n  three-quarters to the right, the eyes directed to the right.

(1·00 × 0·89.)]\r\n\r\nAt an interval of about eight years we come to the _St. Jerome_\r\n(No. 1585), a religious scene set, curiously enough, in a moonlight\r\nlandscape, which has darkened. The exact interpretation to be placed\r\nupon the _Allegory in honour of Alfonso d’Avalos_ (No. 1589), of\r\nabout 1533, has been much discussed; it is supposed to represent\r\nAlfonso bidding farewell to his wife on his departure for the wars,\r\nand entrusting her to the safe keeping of Chastity, Cupid, who bears\r\na sheaf of arrows, and a third figure. The _Portrait of Francis I._\r\n(No. 1588), whom Titian never saw, appears to have been painted about\r\n1536 from a medal, and represents the King in profile. François I. died\r\nin 1547. It belongs to the same period as the _Portrait of a Man in\r\nDamascened Armour with a Page holding his Helmet_ in the collection of\r\nCount Potocki. Another portrait, painted about 1543, represents a _Man\r\nwith a Black Beard resting his Hand on the Ledge of a Pilaster_ (No.\r\n1593). By this time Titian’s art was rapidly maturing, as we see from\r\nhis magnificent and imposing _Supper at Emmaus_ (No. 1581) of the same\r\nyear. It had passed from Mantua to England before being acquired by\r\nthat excellent connoisseur, Jabach. It is said to be signed _Ticianus\r\nF._, while the _Christ Crowned with Thorns_ (No. 1583), which was\r\npainted for a church in Milan about 1550, is inscribed TITIANVS _F._\r\nWhen Charles I., as Prince of Wales, visited Madrid in 1623, he was\r\npresented with the _Jupiter and Antiope_ (No. 1587), which has the\r\nalternative title of the _Venus del Pardo_. It had been painted for\r\nPhilip II., and had already escaped the fire which broke out in the\r\nPrado. Jabach acquired it for 600 guineas, and passed it on to Cardinal\r\nMazarin, from whom it was acquired for 10,000 _livres tournois_ by\r\nLouis XIV. It escaped destruction by fire in the Old Louvre in 1661. It\r\nhas been very much repainted from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TITIAN’S FOLLOWERS\r\n\r\nThe _Madonna and Child, with St. Catherine (? St. Agnes), and St. John\r\nthe Baptist as a Child_ (No. 1579), which has been enlarged by the\r\naddition of a strip of canvas down the left side, contains a glimpse of\r\nthe country near Pieve di Cadore, the native place of Titian. Fourteen\r\nof the twenty pictures here officially credited to him are to be\r\nregarded as authentic. Polidoro Lanzani (1515?-1565), an imitator of\r\nTitian, however, painted the _Holy Family with St. John the Baptist_\r\n(No. 1580), and the _Holy Family and Saints_ (No. 1596) in the La Caze\r\nRoom; while Andrea Meldolla (Schiavone), who was a pupil of Titian,\r\nno doubt executed the _Ecce Homo_ (No. 1582) credited to the great\r\nVenetian artist, as well as the _St. John the Baptist_ (No. 1524) which\r\nis rightly assigned to him.\r\n\r\nThe German painter Johan Stephan von Calcar, who to Italian biographers\r\nis known as Giovanni Calcar (1499-1546), was a pupil of Titian. He\r\npainted the imposing _Portrait of a Man_ (No. 1185). He is seen at\r\nhalf length standing, and holding a letter in his right hand; his left\r\nhand to his waist. On a column in the background is painted the coat\r\nof arms, reputed to be that of the Buono family of Venice, which is\r\nrepeated on the bezel of the ring on the forefinger of his left hand.\r\nBelow his right hand is the inscription:\r\n\r\n                               ANNO 1540\r\n                              ÆTATIS 26.\r\n\r\nParis Bordone (1500-1570), who “painted women with more of an eye on\r\nthe fashion-plate than on the expression of their features,” is not\r\nthe author of a _Portrait of a Lady_ (No. 1180A), nor of the _Portrait\r\nof a Man and a Child_ (No. 1180), which seems to be a Flemish rather\r\nthan a Venetian picture. His _Vertumnus and Pomona_ (No. 1178) is less\r\nrepresentative than his _Portrait_ (so called) _of Jeronimo Croft_ (No.\r\n1179). It takes its title from the inscription, “_Spss. Domino Jeronimo\r\nCrofft ... Magior suo semper obsero ... Augusta_,” which is written on\r\nthe letter held in the right hand.\r\n\r\nThe last dying echo of the “fire” and poetry of Giorgione is seen in\r\nsome of the works of Bonifazio Veronese (1487-1553), who was also a\r\npupil of Palma. Bonifazio is now regarded as a single individual,\r\nalthough formerly the varying differences in his style of painting\r\nled certain critics to regard him as three different members of the\r\nsame family. The varied grouping seen in the large canvas entitled\r\n_Holy Family, with St. Francis, St. Anthony, St. Mary Magdalene, St.\r\nElizabeth, and St. John the Baptist_ (No. 1171), and the colouring\r\nof this canvas, seem to prove its authenticity. The smaller picture\r\nof a _Holy Family_ (No. 1172), with a similar pedigree and a Greek\r\ninscription, which includes the same saints, is a mediocre work. The\r\n_Madonna and Child, with St. Joseph, St. John the Baptist, St. Paul,\r\nand St. Ursula_ (No. 1674D) is a poor picture.\r\n\r\nFrom the studio of Bonifazio issued Jacopo Bassano (1510?-1592), whose\r\n_Vintage_ (No. 1428) shows his predilection for introducing animals and\r\nkneeling peasants into genre pictures, the treatment of which is apt\r\nto be rugged. This did not prevent his at times painting striking and\r\nvigorous portraits. The Louvre contains a good example of this branch\r\nof his art in the _Portrait of Giovanni da Bologna_ (No. 1429), which\r\nis at present not exhibited. _The Animals entering the Ark_ (No. 1423),\r\n_Moses striking the Rock_ (No. 1424), _Cana of Galilee_ (No. 1425),\r\n_Christ bearing His Cross_ (No. 1426), and the _Descent from the Cross_\r\n(No. 1427) are also credited to him in the Catalogue.\r\n\r\nLeandro Bassano (1558-1623), his son, is represented in the La Caze\r\ncollection by an _Adoration of the Magi_ (No. 1430) and a _Rustic\r\nLabour_ (No. 1431).\r\n\r\nThe vigorous, ambitious and late Venetian painter Tintoretto\r\n(1518-1594), who painted portrait-groups, religious subjects,\r\nand mythological compositions on a large scale, and brought his\r\nachievements to completion with extraordinary rapidity, is not\r\nadequately represented in this Gallery, in which, however, no fewer\r\nthan eleven works pass under his name. His _Susanna and the Elders_\r\n(No. 1464) testifies to the increasing frequency with which painters\r\nor their patrons at that period preferred the representation of\r\nsensational incidents from the Apocrypha. The subject is unattractive,\r\nbut the picture, which is in a very dirty state, is wonderfully painted.\r\n\r\nThe _Paradise_ (No. 1465) is but a preliminary sketch for the colossal\r\npainting, measuring 84 ft. × 34 ft.,—the largest oil-painting by an\r\nold master in existence,—which Tintoretto painted for the end wall of\r\nthe Sala del Maggior Consiglio in the Doge’s Palace at Venice. The\r\n_Portrait of a Man holding a Handkerchief in his Hand_ (No. 1467)\r\nreveals his great power as a portrait painter.\r\n\r\nThe _Portrait of Pietro Mocenigo_ (No. 1470), signed PETRUS MOCENIO\r\nSENATOR, and the _Portrait of a Venetian Senator_ (No. 1471), inscribed\r\nANNO ÆTATIS LVII MVII IACOMO TENTORETO . F, are among the pictures of\r\nthe La Caze collection.\r\n\r\nIn Room XV., which is given up to self-portraits by artists, hangs\r\na picture which passes as an authentic _Portrait of Tintoretto_\r\n(No. 1466) by himself. It is inscribed JACOBVS TENTORETVS PICT^{OR}\r\nVENET^{IVS} and IPSIVS. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PAOLO VERONESE\r\n\r\nThe harmonious colour, the sense of material magnificence, and the\r\nmasterly draughtsmanship of Paolo Veronese (1528-1588) are seen to the\r\ngreatest advantage in his _Marriage at Cana_ (No. 1192). He signed a\r\ncontract in June 1562, to paint this large picture, which measures\r\n21 ft. × 32 ft., for the refectory of San Giorgio Maggiore at Venice,\r\nand completed it by September 8, 1563. According to the agreement,\r\nPaolo was to receive 324 ducats, a sum equal to-day to about £200;\r\nto be fed during the time he was engaged on the work; to be repaid\r\nthe cost of the materials; and to receive a pipe of wine. The picture\r\nwas seized by Napoleon during his victorious campaign of 1797, and\r\nbrought by road to Paris. In accordance with the terms of the Peace of\r\nCampo Formio of 1814, it should have been returned. As it had proved\r\na very difficult matter to take it to Paris, where it had to go into\r\nthe restorer’s hands, the French urged that it was too vast and too\r\ndilapidated to bear a second journey. Astonishing as it may seem to\r\nus to-day, the Italians accepted the suggestion and in exchange took\r\nCharles Le Brun’s large but mediocre _Magdalene at the Feet of Jesus_,\r\nperhaps because it measured 12 ft. 6 in. × 10 ft. 4 in. Le Brun’s\r\npicture now hangs in the Venice Gallery (No. 377), the Catalogue of\r\nwhich pointedly remarks that “the exchange is much to be regretted.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                          PLATE XIII.—TITIAN\r\n\r\n                             (1489?-1576)\r\n\r\n                            VENETIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                       No. 1584.—THE ENTOMBMENT\r\n\r\n                         (La Mise au Tombeau)\r\n\r\n  The dead body of the Christ is borne on a white cloth by Nicodemus\r\n  and Joseph of Arimathæa. Nicodemus is seen from the back wearing\r\n  a pale red tunic and a parti-coloured scarf; Joseph of Arimathæa\r\n  in green robes is in profile towards the right. St. John in a red\r\n  robe supports the right arm of the Christ. To the left St. Mary\r\n  Magdalene, with her arms around the Virgin, gazes in profound grief\r\n  at the Christ.

(1·48 × 2·15.)]\r\n\r\nPaolo Veronese’s masterly work contains no devotional feeling. The\r\nScriptural story merely serves as a pretext for depicting a scene\r\nof Venetian festivity and material magnificence with imposing\r\narchitectural background. The grouping of the figures is varied,\r\ndexterously disposed and stately, while the colour is harmonious and\r\nsparkling. The changing of the water into wine is, however, merely\r\nincidental. It is a significant fact that a work of this description,\r\nin which Art in Venice begins to trick herself out in meretricious\r\nembellishments, should have been regarded as a seemly decoration for\r\nthe refectory of a convent. An additional but frankly worldly interest\r\nis imparted to the work by the introduction of a portrait of Alfonso\r\nd’Avalos (whose portrait by Titian we have already seen) as the\r\nbridegroom, on the extreme left of the composition; to his left is the\r\nbride, with the features of Eleonora of Austria. The other figures\r\ninclude François I., dressed in blue and wearing a curious headdress;\r\nMary of England, sister of Henry VIII. and widow of Louis XII., in\r\nyellow; the Sultan Soliman, in green, at the side of a negro prince\r\nwho addresses a servant. On the left of the next figure sits Vittoria\r\nColonna, whom Michelangelo described as “a man within a woman,” plying\r\nher toothpick! At the end of the table, speaking to a servant, is the\r\nEmperor Charles V., seen in profile and wearing the Order of the Golden\r\nFleece. The introduction of the fool with the bells in the centre of\r\nthe picture is perhaps intended to express the pomp and pleasure of\r\nthe world pursued without thought of Christ, who, however, occupies\r\nthe place of honour in the centre of the composition. The couple of\r\ndogs in leash, one gnawing a bone, and a cat, lying on her back as she\r\nscratches at one of the vases which hold the wine on the right of the\r\ncomposition, may stand for merely brutal nature.\r\n\r\nThe painter’s personal interest in the scene is depicted in the group\r\nof four artists in the foreground. Paolo himself is playing a viol;\r\njust behind him is Tintoretto with a similar instrument; while on the\r\nright are Titian, in red with a bass viol, and Bassano playing the\r\nflute. The theory put forward by Mr. Herbert Cook that Titian was born\r\nas late as 1489, and so would be seventy-four years old in 1562-63,\r\nthe year in which this picture was painted, certainly seems to find\r\ncorroboration in the features here given to Titian by Paolo Veronese.\r\nHe certainly does not look eighty-seven years of age, as he should do\r\nif he had been born as early as 1476.\r\n\r\nIn the Catalogue sixteen pictures are assigned to Paolo Veronese. The\r\n_Portrait of a Lady and a Child playing with a Dog_ (No. 1199) is an\r\nearly work. The _Disciples at Emmaus_ (No. 1196), which is signed\r\n“PAOLO VERONESE,” is another of the master’s imposing canvases, as\r\nalso is the _Feast in the House of Simon the Pharisee_ (No. 1193),\r\nwhich was presented to Louis XIV. by the Venetian Republic in 1665, and\r\nwas for many years hung at Versailles. This artist is also officially\r\ncredited with the _Burning of Sodom_ (No. 1187), a _Holy Family, with\r\nSt. George, St. Catherine, and a Male Donor_ (No. 1190), a _Holy\r\nFamily, with St. Elizabeth and St. Mary Magdalene, and a Female Donor_\r\n(No. 1191), a _Christ heeding Peter’s Wife’s Mother_ (No. 1191A), a\r\n_Christ fainting under the weight of the Cross_ (No. 1194), a _Calvary_\r\n(No. 1195), and an _Esther fainting before Ahasuerus_ (No. 1189).\r\nThe _Susan and the Elders_ (No. 1188) is a replica of a picture in\r\nthe collection of the Duke of Devonshire. The _St. Mark crowning the\r\nTheological Virtues_ (No. 1197), and the _Jupiter hurling Thunderbolts\r\non Criminals_ (No. 1198), were originally executed as ceiling paintings\r\nfor the Doge’s Palace. The _Christ with the Terrestrial Globe_ (No.\r\n1200) and the _Portrait of a Lady in Black_ (No. 1201) are only studio\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nLittle artistic ability is shown in the empty abstractions, and\r\nat times meaningless productions, of many of the late sixteenth,\r\nseventeenth, and eighteenth century Venetian artists. Felice Riccio\r\n(Il Brusasorci the Younger) (1540-1605) is given as the painter of a\r\n_Holy Family_ (No. 1463); Alessandro Turchi (Orbetto) (1582-1648) of\r\nthree pictures (Nos. 1558-1560); Sebastiano Ricci (1659?-1734) of four\r\ncompositions (Nos. 1458-1461); Antonio Pellegrino (1675-1741) of an\r\n_Allegory_ (No. 1413); Alessandro Varotari (1590-1650) of an utterly\r\nuninspired _Venus and Cupid_ (No. 1574); and Pietro della Vecchia\r\n(1605-1678) of a dull _Portrait of a Man_ (No. 1576).\r\n\r\nA century later than the stupendous achievements of Tintoretto and\r\nVeronese the art of Venice had passed into decline, but a glimmer of\r\nthe genius that had found expression in the gorgeously decorative art\r\nin Venice in the sixteenth century was yet to be reflected in the work\r\nof Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (1692-1769). His _Last Supper_ (No. 1547)\r\nwas purchased for £400 in 1877, and his sketch for the _Triumph of\r\nReligion_ (No. 1549A) for £1200 in 1903. By him also is the _Banner_\r\n(No. 1549), depicting on the one side _St. Martin saying Mass_, and on\r\nthe other _The Madonna and Child_. An _Apparition of the Virgin to St.\r\nJerome_ (No. 1548) is one of the less striking pictures in the La Caze\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nAnother decorative painter was Antonio Canale, generally known as\r\nCanaletto (1697-1768), who is well represented in the _View of the\r\nChurch of Santa Maria della Salute and the Grand Canal_ (No. 1203). The\r\nLouvre appears to contain nothing by Bernardo Bellotto (1720-1780),\r\nwho is sometimes referred to as Canaletto, and is seen to the best\r\nadvantage at Dresden.\r\n\r\nCanaletto’s pupil, Francesco Guardi (1712-1793), who was born of\r\nAustrian parentage, is the painter of seven Venetian scenes: _After\r\nwedding the Adriatic, the Doge embarks at the Lido on the “Bucentaur”_\r\n(No. 1328); _The Doge proceeds to S. Maria della Salute to commemorate\r\nthe Preservation of Venice from the Plague in 1630_ (No. 1329); _Fête\r\ndu Jeudi Gras in the Piazzetta_ (No. 1330); _The Procession of Corpus\r\nDomini in the Piazza of S. Marco_ (No. 1331); _The Visit of the Doge to\r\nthe Church of S. Zaccharia on Easter Day_ (No. 1332); _The Doge seated\r\non his Throne in the Sala del Collegio_ (No. 1333); _Coronation of the\r\nDoge_ (No. 1334); and a _View of the Church of S. Maria della Salute_\r\n(No. 1335). Guardi’s pupil, François Casanova (1739-1805), a painter of\r\nbattle-pieces, worked in France; some of his pictures are hung in the\r\nFrench Rooms.\r\n\r\nWith Guardi we close the chapter of Venetian art which, owing to four\r\ncenturies of high aspiration and magnificent achievement, came to an\r\nend later than the art of any other school of painting in Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PADUAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nFar-reaching influences were to be exerted by classical Padua on the\r\nart of the neighbouring cities of Northern Italy. Padua was a city of\r\ngreat antiquity, and had been sufficiently powerful and prosperous\r\neven in Roman times to excite the cupidity of its enemies. Eventually\r\nthe Goths and other barbarian hordes had destroyed its monuments of\r\nthe Roman age; the spirit of antiquity, nevertheless, survived until\r\nGiotto came at the very beginning of the fourteenth century to decorate\r\nthe walls of the Chapel of the Madonna dell’ Arena, which had been\r\nfounded in 1303 by Enrico Scrovegno on the site of an ancient Roman\r\narena. These very precious frescoes by Giotto, which fortunately are\r\nstill preserved, revolutionised art, and the movement initiated by him\r\nquickened the art-life of this University city.\r\n\r\nHalf a century later, Altichiero Altichieri (fl. 1320-1385) developed\r\nhis art under the influence of Giotto, and beautified the churches\r\nof Padua with frescoes, the figures in which he clothed in fanciful\r\nattire. An art movement was now on foot, and the influence of\r\nAltichieri, who was later to become the founder of the school of\r\nVerona, was to be revealed in the work of his follower Pisanello, the\r\nVeronese painter and medallist.\r\n\r\nThe long residence in Padua of Donatello (1386-1466), the great\r\nFlorentine sculptor, and the erection of his famous equestrian statue\r\nof Gattamelata initiated in Padua the Renaissance movement, which\r\nsoon took deep root in this ancient city. The example of Donatello in\r\nsculpture before long brought about the foundation of a local school\r\nof painting which was rapidly developed through the shrewd commonsense\r\nrather than the artistic achievements of Francesco Squarcione\r\n(1394-1474). It is noteworthy that Squarcione had travelled in the\r\nEast, and had there formed a collection of antique works of plastic art\r\nwhich became the basis of his art-teaching.\r\n\r\nOne of the numerous pupils of Squarcione was Gregorio Schiavone (“The\r\nSlavonian”) (fl. 1440-1470), a native of Dalmatia, who in the studio\r\nof his Paduan master met Andrea Mantegna. The Louvre authorities with\r\nsome hesitancy attribute to Schiavone a _Madonna and Child_ (No. 1523).\r\nAlthough it is hardly by him, it exhibits some of the characteristics\r\nof Schiavone, who was fond of decorating his pictures with festoons of\r\nflowers and fruit in much the same way that his Venetian contemporary,\r\nCarlo Crivelli, delighted to adorn his large panel pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ANDREA MANTEGNA\r\n\r\nAndrea Mantegna (1431-1506) was adopted at the age of ten by\r\nSquarcione, and so naturally became his pupil. No better training\r\ncould have been chosen for the boy, who had a natural taste for the\r\nclassics, proof of which is further afforded by the Latin inscriptions\r\non his pictures. Andrea seems to have quickly realised the connection\r\nbetween the traditions of Paduan antiquities and the classical models\r\nof ancient Greece which his adoptive father Squarcione had brought home\r\nwith him from his travels. Andrea in time became deeply impressed with\r\nthe methods of Jacopo Bellini, whose daughter Niccolosia he married\r\nin 1453, to the great displeasure of Squarcione. Another powerful\r\ninfluence on Mantegna may be traced to the bronzes which Donatello\r\nexecuted for the Church of Sant’ Antonio of Padua in that city.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                      PLATE XIV.—ANDREA MANTEGNA\r\n\r\n                              (1431-1506)\r\n\r\n                             PADUAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                          No. 1375.—PARNASSUS\r\n\r\n                             (Le Parnasse)\r\n\r\n  On the summit of an arched rock stand Mars and Venus before a\r\n  draped bed backed by orange trees.

(1·60 × 1·92.)]\r\n\r\nAfter painting the frescoes in the Church of the Eremitani at\r\nPadua, Andrea in 1457 executed a large and striking altarpiece for\r\nthe Church of San Zeno in Verona. It was removed by Napoleon’s agents\r\nto France in 1797, but only the principal panel was returned to that\r\nchurch in 1815. The three predella panels were retained in France. The\r\ncentre one of these, depicting the _Calvary_, is now in the Louvre (No.\r\n1373); the other two, representing the _Agony in the Garden_ and the\r\n_Resurrection_, have long hung in the Museum at Tours. The severity of\r\nthe statuesque figures and the certainty of the drawing seen in the\r\n_Calvary_ are characteristic of the early period of the master.\r\n\r\nMantegna now removed to Mantua, where he entered the service of\r\nLodovico II., Marquis of Mantua, as his Court Painter, remaining\r\nthere for the rest of his life. The _Madonna of Victory_ (No. 1374)\r\nwas painted to commemorate the victory gained at the Pass of Fornovo\r\non the Taro on July 6, 1495, by Giovanni Francesco III., Marquis of\r\nMantua, over Charles VIII. of France. In the centre of the picture the\r\nMadonna and Child are enthroned. On the left kneels the Marquis, and\r\non the right is St. Elizabeth, the patron saint of Gonzaga’s wife,\r\nIsabella d’Este, “at the sound of whose name all the Muses rise and do\r\nreverence.” St. Michael standing behind the Duke, and St. George behind\r\nSt. Elizabeth, hold the robe of the Madonna, who is thus represented\r\nas taking under her protection the two principal figures. In the\r\nbackground on the left is St. Andrew, name-saint of the painter and one\r\nof the patrons of Mantua. On the right is St. Longinus with the spear\r\nwith which he pierced the side of Christ. His relics were preserved\r\nin the Church of St. Andrea in Mantua. The garlands of flowers and\r\nfestoons of fruit are a well-known device in Mantegna’s pictures.\r\n\r\nMantegna’s _Parnassus_ (No. 1375, Plate XIV.) illustrates the _amours_\r\nof Mars and Venus, which were discovered by her husband, Vulcan. In\r\nthe foreground the Muses are dancing. The group of the Muses was\r\nafterwards appropriated by Giulio Romano for his _Dance of Apollo\r\nand the Muses_ in the Pitti Palace at Florence. This painting was\r\nexecuted in 1497, just before the coming of the Renaissance feeling\r\ninto Venetian art and the representation of classical myth. Notice the\r\nexcellently drawn and highly characteristic shells and stones placed\r\nin the foreground. In the same year Mantegna painted the _Triumph of\r\nWisdom and Virtue over the Vices_ (No. 1376), the last of the four\r\npictures by him in this Gallery. In the corner to the extreme left is\r\nVirtus Deserta, who appears under the guise of a laurel tree with a\r\nwoman’s head; about the stem is wound a scroll with inscriptions in\r\nLatin, Greek, and Hebrew. The Latin inscription reads:\r\n\r\n                     AGITE PELLITE SEDIBUS NOSTRIS\r\n                      FAEDA HAEC VICIORV̄ MONSTRA\r\n                  VIRTUTVM COELITVS AD NOS REDEV̄TIVM\r\n\r\nand on the inside of the scroll:\r\n\r\n                            DIVAE COMITES.\r\n\r\nThis painting formerly decorated the _camerino_ of Isabella d’Este at\r\nMantua. It was seized at the sack of Mantua by Cardinal Richelieu in\r\n1630, together with the _Parnassus_ (No. 1375), Perugino’s _Combat of\r\nLove and Chastity_ (No. 1567), and Lorenzo Costa’s _Court of Isabella\r\nd’Este_ (No. 1261). _The Mythological Scene_ (No. 1262), which is not\r\nnow exhibited, represents the _Realm of Erotic Love_; it was begun by\r\nMantegna the year he died, and was gone over and completed by Lorenzo\r\nCosta.\r\n\r\nMantegna became involved financially towards the end of his life, and\r\nthe collection he had formed was sold. His last years were clouded by\r\npecuniary embarrassment. His compositions are essentially classic in\r\nspirit, his figures noble and painted in imitation of the antique,\r\nwhile his pagan conceptions prepared the way for those of a later\r\ngeneration in the art of Venice. By this process of gradual evolution\r\nthe school of Padua came to be distinguished among the other local\r\nschools of Northern Italy in the lifetime of Mantegna, whose example\r\ngave a new impulse to contemporary art.\r\n\r\nA small _Adoration of the Magi_ (No. 1678), which is officially\r\nunattributed, is regarded by Mr. Berenson as the work of Bernardo\r\nParenzano (1437-1531), who was influenced by Mantegna, and imitated the\r\nmethods of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nMany other artists bore their part in the work of this school, and\r\nso contributed to the development of this movement which spread to\r\nVeronese and Venetian territory. They are, however, unrepresented in\r\nthe Louvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SCHOOL OF VERONA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundations of the art of Verona were laid in Paduan soil by\r\nAltichieri, who initiated the school of Verona. Veronese art early\r\nfound expression in the naive pictorial and mediæval style practised\r\nby the medallist-painter Antonio Pisanello (1397-1455), whose name\r\nappears to have been an endearing diminutive. He was a follower, if\r\nnot a pupil, of Altichieri. The frequency with which he signed himself\r\n“PICTOR” on his medals leads one to suppose that he looked upon himself\r\nas a painter first and foremost, and contemporary records seem to\r\nconfirm this. His art was so highly reputed in Northern Italy that\r\nthe Venetians thought it advisable to invite him to Venice in 1421 to\r\nassist Gentile da Fabriano in painting frescoes, now destroyed, in the\r\nDoge’s Palace.\r\n\r\nJacopo Bellini also worked at Verona. He is known to have painted\r\na picture of the _Crucifixion_ for the Chapel of S. Niccolò in the\r\nCathedral at Verona in 1436, but, after exercising considerable\r\ninfluence on the art of Northern Italy, it was in 1759 hewn down by a\r\nCanon with a view to beautifying the chapel!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are only two frescoes from the hand of Pisanello\r\nat Verona, while no more than four authentic easel paintings by him\r\nare known to exist, two of them being in the National Gallery. He is\r\nknown to have travelled extensively in Italy, and to have worked also\r\nat Mantua, Ferrara, and Rimini. The traditions of mediæval chivalry and\r\nthe pictorial parade of pomp and mundane realism which are reflected in\r\nhis work show that his contemporaries were justified in the high esteem\r\nin which they held him.\r\n\r\nPisanello’s love of depicting birds and animals is shown in his two\r\npictures in the National Gallery, but in the _Portrait of a Princess\r\nof the Este Family_ (No. 1422A, or No. 1422 _Bis_) he is shown to have\r\nbeen a lover of flowers also. This small panel was formerly attributed\r\nto Piero dei Franceschi, the Umbrian artist. For many years it hung\r\namong the Drawings, being apparently considered unworthy of a place in\r\nits proper environment, among the Italian primitive paintings, where\r\nit is now hung. It was purchased in 1893 out of the Felix Bamberg\r\ncollection. The lady is seen in profile to the left. Her hair is\r\ndressed according to the fashion of the period, the front hair being\r\nplucked out to render the forehead round and high, while the nape of\r\nher neck for the same reason is hairless. She wears a white dress\r\nwith loose-falling red sleeves; a sprig of juniper (_ginevra_) is let\r\ninto her dress just above the left shoulder. It has been assumed from\r\nthis that we here have a _Portrait of Ginevra d’Este_. She was the\r\ndaughter of Niccolò II. d’Este by his second wife, the infamous and\r\nill-treated Parisina Malatesta, who was decapitated in 1425. Ginevra\r\n(1419-1440) became the wife of Sigismondo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, in\r\n1433, and died three years later. The background is composed of pinks\r\nand columbines, among which fly four highly decorative butterflies.\r\nThe embroidery on the left sleeve of the dress is patterned with the\r\n_impresa_ of a crystal vase set round with pearls. It is interesting\r\nto note that Ginevra’s husband, Sigismondo, is probably the Donor in\r\nthe _Madonna and Child and a Kneeling Donor_ (No. 1159A or No. 1279)\r\nby Jacopo Bellini which hangs next to it on the left. The only other\r\npainted portrait by Pisanello known is the later, and larger, one of\r\nLeonello d’Este in the Bergamo Gallery.\r\n\r\nBono da Ferrara (fl. 1450-1461) was a pupil of Pisanello, and Oriolo\r\n(fl. 1450) was a follower of his; their pictures are extremely rare.\r\nThe Louvre contains no picture by Liberale da Verona (1451-1536),\r\na master who had many pupils, among whom may be included Girolamo\r\ndai Libri (1474-1556) and Francesco Caroto (1470-1546). The _Madonna\r\nand Child and St. John the Baptist_ (No. 1318), which is officially\r\ncatalogued under the name of Girolamo, has long been held to be by\r\nCaroto.\r\n\r\nDomenico Brusasorci (“The Rat-burner”) (1494-1567) was the father of\r\nFelice Riccio and a pupil of Caroto. He has been claimed as the author\r\nof the _Madonna and St. Martina_ (No. 1163), which passes in the\r\nCatalogue as being by the very late Roman painter Pietro Berretini da\r\nCortona (1596-1669). Other versions of this composition, representing\r\nSt. Martina triumphing over the Idols, are known. A large number of the\r\nprominent Veronese painters are unrepresented in this collection, but\r\nthe influence of Liberale is frequently seen. The _Council of Trent_\r\n(No. 1586) may be assigned to Paolo Farinati, although it is regarded\r\nby the authorities as coming from the hand of Titian. By the time that\r\nFarinati died, art in Verona had passed into decline.\r\n\r\nOne of the most decorative painters in Italy in the sixteenth century\r\nwas Paolo Veronese, who although a native of Verona spent the best\r\nyears of his life in Venice. He is usually included among the artists\r\nof Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SCHOOL OF FERRARA\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to tradition the most famous artist in the school of Ferrara\r\nbefore Tura was Ettore de’ Bonacossi, of whom little is known.\r\n\r\nAt Ferrara, the city of the Este family, as at all the Italian courts,\r\nthe art of painting was liberally patronised. All Ferrarese art was\r\nmore or less Paduan both in origin and style, Cosimo Tura (1430?-1495),\r\nthe founder of this school, having worked at Padua as a pupil of\r\nSquarcione.\r\n\r\nThe seriousness of Cosimo Tura’s realism was unyielding to those\r\nintellectual qualities that dominated the art of Florence in his\r\nday; but, in spite of a certain harshness of effect, the vigour of\r\nhis design and the dignity of his conception give permanent value to\r\nthe work of this master. Tura is represented in the Louvre by two\r\npictures; the figures seen in his large lunette of the _Pietà_ (No.\r\n1556) are admirably designed to fill up the space they occupy. This\r\npanel is a dismembered part of an altarpiece which was painted for\r\nthe Roverella family, and was formerly in its entirety in the Church\r\nof S. Giorgio fuori le Mura at Ferrara. The _Pietà_ eventually passed\r\nto the Campana collection, and so to the Louvre. The drapery in this\r\npanel, which is cracked horizontally, is tinny, and the flesh is\r\nmetallic with its white and purple lights, while the bones in the\r\nfaces being over-prominent create an unpleasant effect. The centre\r\npanel of the original altarpiece represents the _Madonna and Child\r\nEnthroned_. It passed in time into the Frizzoni collection at Bergamo,\r\nand was subsequently purchased in 1867 from Sir Charles Eastlake for\r\nthe National Gallery (No. 772). The sinister wing of the original\r\naltarpiece depicts the _Bishop Lorenzo Roverella presented to the\r\nVirgin by St. Maurelius and St. Paul_, and is now in the private rooms\r\nof the Colonna Palace in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Church of S. Giorgio fuori le Mura at Ferrara also at one time\r\ncontained another altarpiece painted by Cosimo Tura. It was placed\r\nover the altar of St. Maurelius, but has long ago been dismembered.\r\nOne of its panels is the _Flight into Egypt_, in the collection of\r\nMr. R. H. Benson; two others, representing a _Scene from the Life\r\nof St. Maurelius_ and _The Martyrdom of St. Maurelius_, are in the\r\nFerrara Gallery; another is the _Adoration of the Magi_, in the\r\npossession of the Contessa di Santa Fiora, in Rome; while a fifth, the\r\n_Circumcision_, belongs to the Marchesa Passeri, in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre possesses an arched panel of _A Monk_ (No. 1557) by Tura.\r\nThe panel is split and the cheek of the saint injured.\r\n\r\nThe seriousness of purpose which inspired Cosimo Tura was absorbed by\r\nhis pupil Francesco Cossa (1435-1477), whose art is not seen at the\r\nLouvre. One of Cossa’s pupils was Lorenzo Costa, who in 1483 passed\r\nfrom Ferrara to Bologna, to which city he carried the principles of\r\nTura’s training. Francesco Bianchi (1460-1510) was another of Tura’s\r\npupils, but he belongs more strictly to the school of Modena. Another\r\npupil in the studio of the _chef d’ecole_ of Ferrarese painting was\r\nErcole Roberti (1430?-1496), who also worked at Padua. This painter,\r\nwhose full name was Ercole de’ Roberti Grandi, has been justly claimed\r\nas the author of the two small panels representing _St. Apollonia_ (No.\r\n1677A), holding in her hand the pincers, the symbol of her martyrdom,\r\nand _St. Michael_ (No. 1677B). These companion pictures are officially\r\ndescribed under the ambiguous designation of “Ferrarese School, XVI\r\ncentury.” They, however, clearly belong to the earlier century, and are\r\nprobably by Roberti.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre contains nothing by Ercole Roberti’s pupil, Ercole di Giulio\r\nCesare Grandi (1465?-1531). Ercole Grandi’s influence is sometimes seen\r\nin the exceedingly rare pictures of Giovanni Battista Benvenuto, who is\r\nbetter known under the name of Ortolano (“the gardener”), and takes his\r\nname from the occupation of his father. The art of Ortolano (1460-1529)\r\nis seen to the greatest advantage in the _St. Sebastian, St. Roch, and\r\nSt. Demetrius_, in the National Gallery (No. 669). An immature work by\r\nhim is apparently the _Nativity_ in this Gallery (No. 1401), which in\r\nthe opinion of the compilers of the Catalogue is by Domenico Panetti\r\n(1450?-1512?), a pupil of Lorenzo Costa. Panetti’s works are rarely met\r\nwith out of Italy.\r\n\r\nAmong the pictures of this school, those of Lodovico Mazzolino\r\n(1478?-1528) are perhaps the easiest to recognise. His _Holy Family_\r\n(No. 1387) is not now exhibited, but the _Christ preaching to the\r\nMultitude on the Sea of Galilee_ (No. 1388) is evidently by him,\r\nalthough it has been ranked by one critic as a Flemish picture painted\r\nunder the inspiration of Mazzolino and Dosso Dossi.\r\n\r\nPanetti was the master of Benvenuto Tisi, a very prolific painter who\r\nis better known by the name of Garofalo (1481?-1559), owing to his\r\noccasionally painting a gillyflower into his pictures as a signature.\r\nAlthough the Catalogue includes four small works by this artist, a\r\n_Circumcision_ (No. 1550), a _Holy Family_ (No. 1552), a _Madonna and\r\nChild_ (No. 1554), and a _Sleeping Child Jesus_ (No. 1553), only the\r\nlast of them is now exhibited.\r\n\r\nAnother artist in this school who signed his pictures with a _rebus_\r\nwas Giovanni Lutero (1479?-1542), who is better known under the name\r\nof Dosso Dossi. A typical instance of this punning use of his name is\r\nthe _Money Changers driven out of the Temple_, in the Doria Gallery at\r\nRome; it is signed with a “D” traversed by a bone (_osso_), obviously\r\na play on his name of Dosso or D OSSO. No picture by Dosso Dossi is now\r\nexhibited.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Bonsignori (1455-1519), Marco Zoppo (fl. 1471-1498), Michele\r\nColtellini (1480-1542), Ippolito Scarsellino (1551-1620), Girolamo\r\nda Carpi, and other Ferrarese painters are unrepresented in this\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SCHOOL OF MILAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe painters who practised in Milan in the fourteenth century were\r\nlittle better than provincial craftsmen who had come within the range\r\nof the Giottesque tradition without grasping the more vital of its\r\nprinciples. Those who worked in Milanese territory in the first half of\r\nthe fifteenth century acquired some of the reflected influences which\r\npassed from the work of Pisanello and Jacopo Bellini in Verona, and\r\nfrom the more striking achievements of the Paduan and early Venetian\r\nschools, but their work lacked all trace of originality.\r\n\r\nA painter of the name of Michelino Molinari da Besozzo (fl. 1394-1442),\r\nor Michele da Pavia, was painting at Milan about 1420. However,\r\nthere cannot be said to have been a school of painting, but only an\r\naggregation of painters in Milanese territory, prior to the arrival at\r\nPavia and Milan of the Brescian-born master, Vicenzo Foppa, about 1458.\r\nPrevious to that important event, if not throughout the whole range of\r\nits activity, Milanese art lacked the higher elements of genius in all\r\nmatters æsthetic. As a school it was to the end too inclined to mere\r\nprettiness and superficial sweetness.\r\n\r\nThe Umbrian-born architect and painter, Bramante (1444-1514), who had\r\nreceived his education in Florence, painted in Lombardy from 1472-1474,\r\nas his Panigarola frescoes now in the Brera testify. Bramante also\r\ninfluenced Foppa, whose work is well defined and whose colouring is\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\nSide by side with Foppa at the head of the Milanese school comes\r\nBernardino Butinone (fl. 1450-1507), a great deal of whose work may\r\nstill be seen at Milan. A _Madonna and Child_ (No. 1523), which is\r\ndoubtfully ascribed in the Catalogue to Gregorio Schiavone, a pupil of\r\nSquarcione at Padua, may possibly be by Butinone, whose art is marked\r\nby an austerity and dryness which are absent from the paintings of\r\nZenale, who was the partner and perhaps a pupil of Butinone.\r\n\r\nThe _Circumcision, with the Portrait of the Donor_ (No. 1545), although\r\ncatalogued under the name of Bramantino, may be by Zenale (1436-1526).\r\nThis panel is inscribed “XL. ANNO 1491. F͞R] I͞A LAPUGNANVS P͞P HVMIL\r\nCAN̄.” Bramantino (1455?-1536?), whose name was Bartolommeo Suardi,\r\ncame under the influence of Foppa and Bramante, and from the latter\r\nacquired his _sobriquet_.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of Borgognone (1455?-1522?) are easily recognised\r\nby the ashen grey pallor of his faces, relieved occasionally by\r\neyelids reddened by grief. He was a prolific painter of religious\r\npictures which show simple pathos. With the possible exception of\r\nthe _Family Portraits_ in the National Gallery (Nos. 779-780), which\r\nare indeed fragments of a standard, and may have been painted by\r\nZenale, Borgognone, whose name was Ambrogio da Fossano, is not known\r\nto have painted a secular subject. This typical Milanese painter\r\nwas another of the pupils of Foppa. Being an architect as well as a\r\npainter, Borgognone delighted in giving an architectural setting to\r\nhis compositions. He also loved to introduce brightly coloured carpets\r\nand draperies, and minutely painted jewellery into his pictures. These\r\ncharacteristics are seen in his companion pictures of _St. Peter Martyr\r\nand a Donoress_ (No. 1182), and _St. Augustine and a kneeling Donor_\r\n(No. 1182A). The latter of this pair of panels of his early period was\r\npurchased from Lord Aldenham in 1899 for 1000 guineas. They originally\r\nformed part of a dismembered altarpiece, the centre panel of which is\r\nnow lost or unidentified. His _Presentation of Christ in the Temple_\r\n(No. 1181), although originally painted on panel, was transferred to\r\ncanvas in 1885. Borgognone might almost be termed the Perugino of the\r\nMilanese school.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ANDREA SOLARIO\r\n\r\nAndrea Solario (1460?-1515?), who was perhaps the pupil of his brother\r\nCristoforo a sculptor and architect, went with him to Venice in 1490\r\nand remained there at least three years. During this time he came under\r\nthe influence of Alvise Vivarini and Giovanni Bellini. Earlier in his\r\ncareer he was impressed by the pictures of Antonello da Messina, who\r\nwas in Venice and Milan in 1475-1476. Solario can hardly have become\r\nAntonello’s pupil at that early age. He must also have come within the\r\nsphere of Leonardo da Vinci’s influence. Leonardo, who worked in Milan\r\nbetween 1482 and 1500 and from 1506 to 1513, was asked by the Cardinal\r\nGeorge of Amboise to decorate a chapel in the Château at Gaillon in\r\nNormandy. He, however, advised the Cardinal to employ Solario. Solario\r\nin consequence went to France in August 1507 to undertake the work.\r\nThe Louvre is rich in his pictures. His charming _Madonna of the Green\r\nCushion_ (No. 1530) is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                       _Andreas de Solario fa._\r\n\r\nThis small panel was once the property of Marie de Médicis. The\r\n_Crucifixion_ (No. 1532) was formerly catalogued under the name of\r\nAndrea de Milan, which led some to confuse Andrea Solario with the much\r\nless efficient painter, Andrea Salaino. This picture is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                    ANDREAS MEDIOLANENSIS FA 1503,\r\n\r\na form of signature which is said to have been employed by Solario only\r\nfor such of his pictures as were destined for other towns than Milan.\r\nThe _Head of St. John the Baptist on a Charger_ (No. 1533) is said to\r\nbe signed and dated\r\n\r\n                    ANDREAS DE SOLARIO, FAT, 1507.\r\n\r\nThe _Portrait of Charles d’Amboise, Seigneur of Chaumont and Governor\r\nof Milan_ (No. 1531), like many other of Solario’s pictures, has in\r\nthe past, when the range of his art was not so well understood, been\r\nattributed to other artists.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BERNARDINO LUINI\r\n\r\nIn Bernardino Luini (1475?-1533?) we have a lyrical artist. He is said\r\nto have been a pupil of one Stefano Scotto, but he was deeply impressed\r\nby the art of Borgognone, and early in the sixteenth century came under\r\nthe influence of Leonardo. Indeed, it was almost impossible at that\r\nperiod of Milanese art for a painter in that school to resist the style\r\nof Leonardo. Although Luini’s works are reminiscent of the greater\r\nmaster, he strove after originality; he was an industrious painter\r\nrather than an artist of genius. Luini is never very emotional, never\r\npassionate, never dramatic. His figures are characterised by sweetness\r\nand grace; his types are refined but insipid and are apt to become\r\nmonotonous. It is as a painter of frescoes that he succeeds best, and\r\nthe Louvre is fortunate in possessing several of his works in that\r\nmedium. The best are a _Nativity_ (No. 1359), and an _Adoration of the\r\nMagi_ (No. 1360). The _Head of Christ_ (No. 1361) is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                         POSCE NE DUBITA QUOD\r\n                      QUODCV̄ PATRI IN NOMINE MEᵒ\r\n                          PETIERIS FIET TIBI.\r\n\r\nThey were acquired in 1867 from the collection of the Duke Antonio\r\nLitta Visconti Arese, of Milan. The Louvre also contains fragments of\r\nlarge fresco paintings of the _Forge of Vulcan_ (No. 1356), a _Child\r\nSeated_ (No. 1357), and a _Child Kneeling_ (No. 1358). They form part\r\nof the series, which is now preserved in Milan, but formerly decorated\r\nthe Villa Pelucca near Monza; they were removed from there in 1817.\r\nThese three fragments have been transferred from plaster to canvas or\r\npanel. The four frescoes (Nos. 1362-1365) are by a pupil. The art of\r\nLuini as a painter on panel is seen to advantage in the _Holy Family_\r\n(No. 1353), the _Virgin and the Infant Christ_ (No. 1354), and _Salome\r\nreceiving the Head of St. John the Baptist_ (No. 1355).\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Leonardo da Vinci, when little over thirty years of age,\r\nat the court of Lodovico Sforza at Milan revolutionised art in that\r\ncity. The exquisite rhythm and balance and the remarkable gestures and\r\nfacial expression seen in his _Last Supper_ must have made a profound\r\nimpression on all the Milanese, people and painters alike. Not having\r\nbeen educated in the profound principles that gradually built up the\r\nschool of Florence, whence the great painter came, the majority of the\r\nnative artists were so overcome by his power that in time they became\r\nenslaved by the magic of his brush.\r\n\r\nAmbrogio da Predis (1455?-1506?), who worked as Leonardo’s assistant\r\non the National Gallery’s replica of the _Virgin of the Rocks_ in this\r\ncollection (No. 1599), is not represented here. Another assistant\r\nand pupil of Leonardo was Bernardino de’ Conti. As we have seen, he\r\nmay be the painter of the _Profile Portrait of a Lady_—or _La Belle\r\nFerronnière_ (No. 1605)—which is officially regarded as being of the\r\n“School of Leonardo.” A similar attribution is also given to the\r\n_Madonna of the Scales_ (No. 1604), which should rather be assigned\r\nto Cesare da Sesto (1477-1523), a sickly and insipid imitator of\r\nthe master. Another of Leonardo’s imitators was Marco d’Oggiono\r\n(1470?-1540). His copy of Leonardo’s _Last Supper_ (No. 1603) is\r\nperhaps of greater interest than his own _Holy Family_ (No. 1382) and\r\n_Madonna and Child_ (No. 1382A).\r\n\r\nOne of the more original of the imitators of Leonardo was Boltraffio\r\n(1467-1516), whose _Madonna of the Casio Family_ (No. 1169) was\r\nformerly in the Milan Gallery, where any picture containing a portrait\r\nof that poet might reasonably have been expected to remain. This\r\npicture is the painter’s masterpiece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SCHOOL OF LOMBARDY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the activity which had prevailed in Milan during the last half of\r\nthe fifteenth century and the first quarter of the sixteenth century,\r\nart in Lombardy rapidly deteriorated. Before the decline had passed\r\ninto decadence Pier Francesco Sacchi (fl. 1512-1527) painted at Pavia\r\nhis _Four Doctors of the Church_ (No. 1488), which is signed in the\r\ncartouche\r\n\r\n                            PETRI FRANCISCI\r\n                            SACHI DE PAPIA\r\n                              OPUS 1516.\r\n\r\nEach of the Doctors duplicates the part of an Evangelist. On the left\r\nSt. Augustine, with his book inscribed “De Civitate Dei,” is also shown\r\nas St. John with his eagle; St. Gregory, with his dove, is also St.\r\nLuke with his bull; St. Jerome, with his cardinal’s hat, is also St.\r\nMatthew with his angel; while St. Ambrose, with his scourge, is also\r\nSt. Mark with his lion. The scourge held by St. Ambrose, a patron saint\r\nof Milan, alludes to his refusing the Emperor Theodosius admittance\r\ninto the church at Milan in consequence of the general massacre he\r\nordered with a view to subduing a sedition at Thessalonica in A.D. 390.\r\n\r\nAnother early-sixteenth-century Pavian painter was Bartolommeo Bononi,\r\nwhose only known picture is the _Madonna and Child, St. Francis, a\r\nBishop, and a Monk_ (No. 1174). It is signed\r\n\r\n             OPUS BARTOLOMEI BONONII CIVIS PAPIENSIS 1501.\r\n\r\non the stump of the tree in the centre foreground.\r\n\r\nA striking, although mediocre, _Family of the Virgin_ (No. 1284) by\r\nLorenzo de’ Fasoli, who is also known as Lorenzo di Pavia, and who died\r\nabout 1520, illustrates the tradition that St. Anne, the mother of the\r\nVirgin Mary, was three times married, Joachim being her third husband;\r\nthe other two were Cleophas and Salome. This composition of seventeen\r\nfigures is signed\r\n\r\n                    LAURENTIVS PAPIEN FECIT MDXIII,\r\n\r\nand is one of the latest examples of this tradition, which about 1520\r\npassed out of art.\r\n\r\nA large Triptych (No. 1384), signed\r\n\r\n                           JOH̄NES MAZONVS\r\n                           DE ALEXĀ PINXIT,\r\n\r\nis by Giovanni Massone, who worked at Alessandria in the second half\r\nof the fifteenth century; it contains the portraits of Pope Sixtus IV.\r\nwith St. Francis of Assisi and Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere under\r\nthe protection of St. Anthony of Padua. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere\r\nwas Bishop of Savona about 1483; he was in 1503 elected Pope under the\r\ntitle of Julius II., and became the patron of Raphael.\r\n\r\nThe remaining pictures of this school are of little account. Bernardino\r\nCampi (1522-1592?) is represented by a _Mater Dolorosa_ (No. 1202); and\r\nBartolommeo Manfredi (1580?-1617) by a _Fortune Teller_ (No. 1368), a\r\nsubject which demonstrates the Decadence in full operation. Giovanni\r\nPaolo Panini (1695-1764), who came to Paris in 1732 and became an\r\nAcademician, seems to have got some satisfaction out of committing to\r\ncanvas a _Concert given at Rome on Dec. 26, 1729, in Honour of the\r\nBirth of the Dauphin, the son of Louis XV._ (No. 1409) and a large\r\n_Interior of St. Peter’s at Rome_ (No. 1408), the latter being signed\r\nand dated 1730.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE SCHOOL OF FERRARA-BOLOGNA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Bologna was visited in 1268 by Oderigi of Gubbio (fl.\r\n1268-1295), who had the benefit of personal intercourse with Giotto in\r\nRome. Bologna produced a skilled miniature painter in Franco Bolognese\r\nin the fourteenth century, but gave birth to few native painters\r\nof merit. Until Francesco Cossa removed from Ferrara to Bologna in\r\n1470, art in the City of the Colonnades was in an undeveloped state.\r\nThe school of Bologna, which may be considered as an offshoot of the\r\nFerrarese school, was further strengthened by the arrival of Lorenzo\r\nCosta.\r\n\r\nLorenzo Costa (1460-1535), who had been a pupil of Francesco Cossa at\r\nFerrara, worked for the Bentivogli family in Bologna until 1509. In\r\nthat year he was induced to fix his abode in Mantua at the instance of\r\nthe Marquis Francesco Gonzaga and his wife Isabella d’Este, whose court\r\npainter, Andrea Mantegna, had died three years earlier. Costa there\r\npainted about 1510 his _Court of Isabella d’Este in the Garden of the\r\nMuses_ (No. 1261), which is signed\r\n\r\n                              L. COSTA F.\r\n\r\nThis famous canvas shows a weakness of drawing and a “want of force\r\nthat mars what is meant for grace.” Costa’s _Mythological Scene_ (No.\r\n1262) is not now exhibited, but in it, as in the majority of his works,\r\nthe figures have no real existence. The heads are usually “screwed\r\non—not always at the proper angle—to crosspoles hung about with\r\nclothes.” His landscapes, however, “without being in any sense serious\r\nstudies, are among the loveliest painted in his day.”\r\n\r\nCosta’s shortcomings were to dominate to the end the school of\r\nBologna, which was essentially, almost from its incipience, one of\r\nDecadence. He became the first direct master of Francesco Francia\r\n(1450-1517), the typical Renaissance painter in Bologna who seems to\r\nhave taken to painting at the relatively advanced age of thirty-five.\r\nFrancia had matriculated in the Goldsmiths’ Guild in 1482 and was\r\nMaster of the Guild in 1483, the year of Costa’s arrival; but until he\r\ncame under the influence of Costa he had worked only as an engraver of\r\n_paci_ in niello-work, a die-sinker, and a medallist. They soon went\r\ninto partnership, the upper storey of their joint workshop being used\r\nfor the painting of pictures, while metal-work was executed below.\r\nFrancia is not seen to the best advantage in the Louvre. His _Christ\r\non the Cross_ (No. 1436) is somewhat unusual in treatment, as a nude\r\nfigure of St. Job, a plague saint, is painted in the foreground. This\r\nlarge picture bears the characteristic signature\r\n\r\n                          FRANCIA AURIFABER,\r\n\r\nand shows his practice of demonstrating the versatility of his many\r\ntalents. The small _Nativity_ (No. 1435) is an authentic work. The\r\n_Madonna and Child, with St. George, St. Sebastian, St. Francis, and\r\nSt. John the Baptist_ (No. 1436A), is known as the _Guastavillani\r\nMadonna_ from the inscription to the effect that Filippo Guastavillani,\r\na Bolognese senator, ordered the picture of Francia. Nevertheless,\r\nthis large panel appears to have been executed by his son, Giacomo.\r\nA _Madonna and Child_ (No. 1437) and a _Holy Family with St. Francis\r\nd’Assisi_ (No. 1437A) are only by pupils.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre contains no example of the work of the Umbrian artist,\r\nTimoteo Viti (1467-1524), who was a pupil of Costa, and from July 1490\r\nto April 1495 worked in the studio of Francia. There are no other\r\nsixteenth-century Bolognese paintings in this collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SCHOOL OF CREMONA\r\n\r\n\r\nThis small and unimportant school includes Boccaccio Boccaccino\r\n(fl. 1460-1518?), who was formed on various Venetian and Milanese\r\ninfluences. The _Holy Family_ (No. 1168) which is credited to him, but\r\nnot now exhibited, seems to be an unattributable panel by some artist\r\nof the Lombard school. This school includes an early-sixteenth-century\r\nimitator who has received the significant name of “Pseudo-Boccaccino,”\r\nbut is not here represented.\r\n\r\nThe _Mater Dolorosa_ (No. 1202) appears to be by Bernardino Campi,\r\na mediocre sixteenth-century painter of the Lombard and Cremonese\r\nschools. Sofonisba Anguissola (1528-1625), a female artist, was his\r\npupil and the wife of Orazio Lomellini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SCHOOL OF BRESCIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThis small town seems to have produced little local talent previous to\r\nthe birth of Foppa. Ottaviano Prandino, who had worked with Altichiero\r\nat Padua, and Bartolommeo Testorino (died about 1429) are little more\r\nthan names.\r\n\r\nVincenzo Foppa (1427?-1516?) was born near Brescia. The theory that\r\nhe studied under Squarcione at Padua lacks confirmation. On the other\r\nhand, he seems to have been little affected by the Squarcionesque\r\ntraditions, and is rather to be regarded as the artistic product of\r\nthe school of Verona, where he would have come under the influence\r\nof Pisanello and Jacopo Bellini. He may have been a friend of Andrea\r\nMantegna. It is, however, not in Brescia, but in Milan that Foppa’s art\r\nmay be studied to-day. He arrived in Pavia about 1458, and became the\r\nfounder of the school of Milan twenty years before Leonardo first took\r\nup his abode at the court of Lodovico Il Moro.\r\n\r\nFoppa’s pupil Vincenzo Civerchio (1470?-1544) and Floriano Ferramola\r\n(1480-1528) were the joint founders of the school of Brescia; Romanino\r\n(1485-1566) was a pupil of the latter. The Louvre is singularly poor\r\nin its representation of this school, which cannot here be studied\r\nearlier than the (so-called) _Portrait of Gaston de Foix_ (No. 1518) by\r\nGiovanni Girolamo Savoldo (1480?-1548?). This canvas, which appears to\r\nbe signed\r\n\r\n          _Opera di Jovanni Jeronimo di Bressia di Savoldi_,\r\n\r\nshows unmistakably the conflicting influences, mostly Venetian, under\r\nwhich this artist worked.\r\n\r\nMoretto (1498?-1555?), who was a pupil of Ferramola and was influenced\r\nby Savoldo and Romanino, produced large and striking altarpieces as\r\nwell as portraits. He met with some success in his attempts to combine\r\na subtlety of feeling peculiar to himself with the “silvery” tones of\r\nwhich he was so fond. His _St. Bernardino of Siena and St. Louis of\r\nToulouse_ (No. 1175) and his _St. Bonaventura and St. Anthony of Padua_\r\n(No. 1176) are arched panels on a much smaller scale than he often uses.\r\n\r\nMoretto’s pupil, Giambattista Moroni (1525?-1578), painted many far\r\nbetter portraits than that of _An Old Man seated_ (No. 1395). The only\r\nother Brescian painting in this collection seems to be the _Portrait of\r\na Man_ (No. 1646), who is seen at half length, seated three-quarters to\r\nthe left and wearing a robe trimmed with fur. Although catalogued as\r\nan unattributable Italian work, it is in our opinion by Calisto Piazza\r\nof Lodi (fl. 1520-1560), the son of Martino Piazza of the Milanese\r\nschool. To Calisto da Lodi has been assigned the _Portrait of a Knight\r\nof Malta_ (No. 1594) which is catalogued as being by Titian.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre is very inferior to the National Gallery in both the quality\r\nand quantity of pictures of this school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SCHOOL OF MODENA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Modena gave birth to the early painters Tommaso da Modena\r\n(1325-1379) and Barnaba da Modena (fl. 1377), who worked in many\r\ndifferent parts of Tuscany. The prominent figure in this school,\r\nhowever, is Francesco Bianchi (1460-1510). This painter, whose name is\r\nsometimes given as Francesco Bianchi Ferrari, was in all probability\r\na pupil of Cosimo Tura at Ferrara. He left that city about 1480 for\r\nModena. His style of painting has been the subject of much discussion,\r\nchiefly because he is regarded as the master of Correggio of Parma.\r\nThe _Madonna and Child, with St. Benedict and St. Quentin_ (No. 1167),\r\nalthough officially catalogued under his name, is not now generally\r\naccepted as his work. In 1725 it was in the Church of St. Quentin\r\nat Parma and attributed to Francia. Certain critics have ascribed\r\nit to Alessandro da Carpi and others to Pellegrino Munari of Modena\r\n(1450?-1523). Bianchi’s work can only be studied in the Pinacoteca\r\nEstense and in the churches at Modena.\r\n\r\nThe three pictures officially catalogued under the name of the\r\nthird-rate artist Bartolommeo Schidone (1570?-1615) are not exhibited,\r\nnor are they missed,—a remark which will also apply to a _St. Cecilia_\r\n(No. 1253) by Jacopo Cavedone (1577-1660).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SCHOOL OF VICENZA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Vicentine painter known to us is Battista da Vicenza (fl.\r\n1450), but it was not until the last quarter of the fifteenth century\r\nthat Vicenza produced a painter of any note. Bartolommeo Montagna\r\n(1460?-1523) studied the art of the Vivarini, and so became the central\r\nfigure in an unimportant school. His _Ecce Homo_ (No. 1393), which\r\nbears the signature:\r\n\r\n                        _Bartholomeus Montagna\r\n                                Fecit_\r\n\r\nin a _cartellino_ fastened to a twig, is a mature work. The delightful\r\nand late picture of _Three Angel Musicians_ (No. 1394), which is signed\r\nin a _cartellino_\r\n\r\n                           _Opus Bartholomei\r\n                              Montagna_,\r\n\r\nshows the unmistakable influence of Gentile Bellini. The same motif is\r\nfound in the three musician angels in Montagna’s magnificent _Madonna\r\nand Child, with St. Andrew, St. Monica, St. Ursula, and St. Sigismund_,\r\nof 1498, in the Brera.\r\n\r\nMontagna’s son, Benedetto (fl. 1500-1540), Giovanni Buonconsiglio\r\n(1470?-1536?), and Giovanni Speranza (1480-1536) also practised as\r\npainters; but Vicentine art from the middle of the sixteenth century\r\nhas little claim on our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SCHOOL OF VERCELLI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest painters in this school was an obscure artist of\r\nthe Old Lombard school named Martino Spanzotti. He was the master of\r\nGaudenzio Ferrari (1471-1546), whose frescoes are easily recognisable\r\nby the crude colour, exuberant imagination, and forceful, almost\r\nbrutal, realism which have caused him to be termed, somewhat loosely,\r\nthe Rubens of Italy. A very late work by him is the _St. Paul_ (No.\r\n1285), which is signed and dated\r\n\r\n                                 1543\r\n                              GAUDENTIUS.\r\n\r\nAnother of Spanzotti’s pupils was Sodoma, who was born at Vercelli in\r\nPiedmont, in 1477. He is best known for the large amount of work that\r\nhe executed at Siena. This prolific artist, like a number of other\r\npainters of this unimportant school, is not represented in the Louvre.\r\nHe died in 1551.\r\n\r\nA faint echo of the teaching of Spanzotti may at times be detected in\r\nthe works of Defendente Ferrari (fl. 1500-1535) and Girolamo Giovenone\r\n(fl. 1513-1527), who are not represented in the Louvre.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                          PLATE XV.—CORREGGIO\r\n\r\n                              (1494-1534)\r\n\r\n                            SCHOOL OF PARMA\r\n\r\n            No. 1117.—THE MYSTIC MARRIAGE OF ST.

(1·05 × 1·02.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SCHOOL OF PARMA\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinctive and perhaps the most sensuous of the\r\nItalian masters is Correggio (1494-1534), who takes his name from his\r\nbirthplace, Il Correggio, a small town near Modena. It was natural,\r\ntherefore, that he should have become the pupil of Francesco Bianchi\r\nof the school of Modena. Correggio came under almost all the leading\r\ninfluences which distinguish the principal Italian schools of the\r\nearly sixteenth century. His “sidelong grace,” his subtle gradations\r\nof tone, his daring foreshortening, his sublimity of space and light,\r\nhis vivid imagination, his profound knowledge of chiaroscuro, render\r\nhim an isolated phenomenon in Italian art at the moment when it was\r\npassing into precipitate decline. His _Marriage of St. Catherine_\r\n(No. 1117, Plate XV.) entirely lacks the dignity and solemnity which\r\nare the dominant features of truly religious art. The figures which\r\nmake up this fascinating composition are delicate, but by no means\r\nof an elevated type. This pseudo-religious picture, when studied\r\ntogether with the _Jupiter and Antiope_ (No. 1118), shows the justice\r\nof the criticism that Correggio’s pictures are “hymns to the charm of\r\nfemininity the like of which have never been known before or since in\r\nChristian Europe.” It is more remarkable that this mythological canvas,\r\nwhich is so full of sensuous vitality, should have been added to the\r\nroyal collection of England in the seventeenth century than that it\r\nshould have been allowed by Cromwell to leave the country a few years\r\nlater. Two Allegories of _Virtue_ and _Vice_, executed by Correggio in\r\ngouache, hang in one of the Rooms of Drawings.\r\n\r\nParmigianino (1504-1540), an imitator of Correggio and in a less degree\r\nof Raphael, who were both shortlived artists, painted the two small\r\npanels of a _Holy Family_ (No. 1385), and a _Holy Family and Saints_\r\n(No. 1386).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SCHOOL OF BOLOGNA\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the deaths of Francia in 1517 and Lorenzo Costa in 1536, painting\r\nin Bologna rapidly decreased in quality, although not in volume. A\r\ndistinctive feature was the work of Marc Antonio Raimondi (b. 1475), a\r\npupil of Francia, who developed the process of engraving on copper.\r\n\r\nBologna, which like other cities of Italy felt the effects of humanism,\r\nacquired an increased importance in political activity through the\r\nmeeting there of Pope Leo X. and Francis I., in 1515, and by the\r\nCoronation of Charles V., on Feb. 24, 1530. It also obtained within\r\na few years a great reputation as an art centre, although it is not\r\neasy for us now to realise why. The esteem in which its art was held\r\nin foreign countries is also difficult to explain. Innocenzo da Imola,\r\nwho had studied under Francia, was the master of Primaticcio, who was\r\nsummoned to France by François I. in 1531. Primaticcio at that time\r\nwas working at Mantua with Giulio Romano, the favourite pupil and the\r\nimitator of Raphael. While Primaticcio took with him the influence\r\nof Bolognese art to Fontainebleau, where he died in 1570, Pellegrino\r\nTibaldi (1527-1591), a pupil of Bagnacavallo, carried the Bolognese\r\ninfluence into Spain.\r\n\r\nThe appreciation by a foreign artist of the art of Bologna is shown in\r\nthe case of Denis Calvaert of Antwerp, who thought the Bolognese school\r\nto be in so flourishing a state, when he passed through on his way to\r\nstudy in Rome, that he decided to abandon his original intention and to\r\nstay on in the city of the Colonnades.\r\n\r\nA striking feature of the literature and art of painting at Bologna\r\nwas that its University had always accorded equal terms to women\r\nstudents with men, and had women professors. Female painters—they were\r\nwithout exception only of the third rank—had worked in Bologna from the\r\ndays of Caterina di Vigri, painter and saint, who was born as early\r\nas 1413. In the last quarter of the sixteenth century, art in Bologna\r\npassed into the complete control of the Eclectics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE DECADENT SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nIn the Florentine and Roman schools the Decadence may be said to have\r\nbegun with the death of Raphael in 1520. With the exception of the\r\nVenetian school, in which art did not languish until after the death\r\nof Tintoretto in 1594, painting rapidly degenerated during the second\r\nhalf of the sixteenth century. Paintings were, of course, produced in\r\ngreat profusion in every art centre of Italy, but form and subject were\r\nnot in true harmony. To a great extent local traditions were abandoned,\r\nthe earlier types varied, and three distinctive movements developed—the\r\n“Mannerists,” the “Eclectics,” and the “Naturalists.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE “MANNERISTS”\r\n\r\nGiulio Romano (1492?-1546) was content to imitate the works of Raphael;\r\nand Daniele da Volterra (1509-1566) tried, as we have seen in his\r\n_David overcoming Goliath_ (No. 1462), to reproduce the swelling\r\nmuscles of Michelangelo. Baroccio (1526-1612) in his _Circumcision_\r\n(No. 1149), which is signed and dated 1570, and in his _Virgin in\r\nGlory, with St. Anthony and St. Lucy_ (No. 1150), sought to reproduce\r\nthe ineffable grace of Correggio; while others endeavoured to\r\nrepeat the enigmatic smile, the “greyhound” eye, and the mysterious\r\nchiaroscuro of Leonardo da Vinci.\r\n\r\nAlthough the “Mannerists” were to be met with in most of the centres of\r\npainting in the sixteenth century, they made Rome the centre of their\r\noperations. Domenico Feti (1589-1624) is represented in the Louvre by\r\nfour canvases, _Nero_ (No. 1286), _Life in the Country_ (No. 1287),\r\n_Melancholy_ (No. 1288), and _The Guardian Angel_ (No. 1289), the\r\nsubjects being highly significant.\r\n\r\nIn the _Holy Family_ (No. 1493) by Sassoferrato (1605-1685) are shown\r\nthe shallowness and empty formalism which produced the fair-haired,\r\nblue-eyed, hyper-sentimental _Madonnas_ with which his name is\r\nassociated. Carlo Dolci is not represented in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nOne of the more estimable artists in the Late Roman school is Carlo\r\nMaratta (1625-1713), who may be judged by the unsigned _Portrait of\r\nMarie Madeleine Rospigliosi_ (No. 1379) and _His Own Portrait_ (No.\r\n1380).\r\n\r\nTwo paintings of _Fruit_ (Nos. 1254, 1255) stand to the credit of M.\r\nA. Cerquozzi (1602-1660), and the art of G. B. Castiglione, of Genoa\r\n(1616-1670), is seen in his _Abraham and Melchizedek_ (No. 1250) and\r\n_Animals and Utensils_ (No. 1252).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE “ECLECTICS”\r\n\r\nA revolt against the methods of the “Mannerists” was made by the\r\nCarracci when they opened their school of art at Bologna in 1589.\r\nThese “Eclectics” (“Pickers and Choosers”) advocated a careful study\r\nof “the drawing of Rome, the Venetian shadow, the terrific force\r\nof Michelangelo’s manner, the natural truth of Titian, the pure\r\nand sovereign style of Correggio, the true symmetry of Raphael,\r\nthe dignity and principle of Tibaldi, the invention of the learned\r\nPrimaticcio, together with a little of the grace of Parmigianino”! It\r\nis not surprising that they in their turn soon sank into mere academic\r\nmediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre is notoriously rich in representative examples of the\r\n“Eclectic” painters’ art. The name of Lodovico Carracci (1555-1619),\r\nthe founder of this school at Bologna, is included in the official\r\nCatalogue, but neither of his two pictures is at present exhibited.\r\nLodovico had as cousins, Agostino (1557?-1602) and Annibale\r\n(1560?-1609), who also worked in Rome. Six of Annibale Carracci’s\r\nfifteen pictures in this collection are now exhibited. The _Madonna of\r\nthe Cherries_ (No. 1217) and the _Sleeping Child Jesus_ (No. 1218) are\r\ncharacteristic, while his huge canvas of _The Virgin appearing to St.\r\nLuke and St. Catherine_ (No. 1219) in every way exemplifies the art of\r\nthis painter and his school. It is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                     ANNIBAL CARACTIUS F. MDXCII.\r\n\r\nPictures of this type were much sought after and prized in the\r\neighteenth century, when this one was seized by Napoleon in Italy,\r\nbut to-day a higher standard of æsthetics has deservedly ruled them\r\nout of fashion. On the other hand, sufficient attention is not now\r\npaid to some of the landscape pictures which the “Eclectics” painted;\r\nAnnibale’s _Fishing_ (No. 1233) and _Hunting_ (No. 1232) are worth the\r\nattention of the student. Antonio Carracci (1583-1618), a less-known\r\nmember of this family, is the author of a large canvas depicting _The\r\nDeluge_ (No. 1235).\r\n\r\nGuido Reni, after working under Denis Calvaert at Bologna, entered\r\nthe school of the Carracci. This fitful sentimentalist indulged in\r\nidealised abstractions that were neither human nor divine, as may\r\nbe seen from his _David and Goliath_ (No. 1439) and _St. Sebastian_\r\n(No. 1450) on the one hand, and his _Ecce Homo_ (No. 1447) and _Mary\r\nMagdalene_ (No. 1448) on the other. Four of his large mythological\r\npaintings (Nos. 1453, 1454, 1455, 1457) show some technical ability.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Albani (1578-1660) was influenced by the Carracci and Guido\r\nReni. The _Diana and Actaeon_ (No. 1111) may be selected out of his\r\nnine productions mentioned in the Catalogue. Domenichino (1581-1641),\r\na pupil of the Carracci, the assistant of Annibale and a friend of\r\nGuido Reni in Rome, was a sentimentalist of the most pronounced order.\r\nHis hard execution and unpleasant colouring can be judged in his _St.\r\nCecilia_ (No. 1613),—her features are singularly ill-proportioned,—but\r\nnine of his other pictures do not take up any of the valuable wall\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThe self-taught artist and insipid Guercino (“The Squintling”)\r\n(1591-1666), after working in Rome, settled in 1642 at Bologna, where\r\nhe died in affluent circumstances. His _Raising of Lazarus_ (No.\r\n1139), the large _Patron Saints of Modena_ (No. 1143), together with a\r\n_Circe_ (No. 1147) and _The Painters Own Portrait_ (No. 1148), are now\r\nexhibited. These and such pictures as were painted by G. A. Donducci\r\n(1575-1655), G. F. Grimaldi (1606-1680), S. Cantarini (1612-1648), and\r\nG. M. Crespi (1665-1747), provoked a fresh reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE “NATURALISTS”\r\n\r\nA natural reaction against the selective methods of the “Eclectics”\r\ngave rise to the “Naturalists,” who, headed by Michelangelo Caravaggio\r\n(1569-1609), made Naples the centre of their operations. The utterly\r\nrepulsive picture entitled _The Death of the Virgin_ (No. 1121), by\r\nCaravaggio, is merely large. Neither _The Fortune Teller_ (No. 1122)\r\nnor the _Concert of Nine Musicians_ (No. 1123) can be compared with\r\nthe really striking and well-painted _Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt,\r\nGrand-Master of Malta_ (No. 1124).\r\n\r\nSalvator Rosa (1615-1675) is represented by _Tobias and the Angel_ (No.\r\n1477) and a _Vision of Saul to Samuel_ (No. 1478). His _Landscape_ (No.\r\n1480) shows that he delighted in “ideas of desolation, solitude and\r\ndanger, impenetrable forests, rocky and storm-lashed shores, in lonely\r\ndells leading to dens and caverns of banditti, alpine ridges, trees\r\nblasted by lightning or sapped by time.” His _Battle_ (No. 1479) is a\r\nstrange production.\r\n\r\nCaravaggio was the master of Ribera (1588-1656), who is also called\r\nSpagnoletto, and is included in the Catalogue among the Spanish\r\nartists. This “Naturalist” school of Naples also included Luca\r\nGiordano (1632-1705), who lived in Spain at one period.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the “Naturalists” is displayed in the prominence they gave\r\nto all that was vulgar, coarse, and vile. With them art in Italy came\r\nto an ignominious end, although in technical accomplishment, in mere\r\ncraftsmanship, they can hold their own with painters of much higher\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                        PLATE XVI.—JAN VAN EYCK\r\n\r\n                             (1390?-1441)\r\n\r\n                         EARLY FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n        No. 1986.—THE VIRGIN AND CHILD AND THE CHANCELLOR ROLIN\r\n\r\n                        (La Vierge au donateur)\r\n\r\n  An angel in a blue alb and with peacock-blue wings is placing an\r\n  elaborate gold crown on the head of the Madonna, who holds the\r\n  Infant Christ on her knee, and is seated towards the right of\r\n  the composition.

(0·66 × 0·62.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE EARLY FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early art of Flanders, unlike that of Italy, does not present\r\nitself at the Louvre, or indeed at any Gallery, in orderly sequence\r\nfrom the immature groping for artistic expression to masterly\r\nachievement. With the exception of the exquisite work of the\r\nlate-fourteenth-century miniaturists, which forms a special branch\r\nof study, there is nothing to bridge the immense gulf that divides\r\nMelchior Broederlam, the earliest known Flemish painter, from the\r\nbrothers Van Eyck, whose earliest known work, the wonderful Ghent\r\npolyptych of _The Adoration of the Lamb_, is, if not quite the\r\nstarting-point, the noblest achievement of the Early Flemish school.\r\nThe invention of oil-painting, in the sense of the word as it is\r\napplied to-day, with which the Van Eycks are credited, no doubt\r\ncontributed largely towards this amazingly sudden progress; but their\r\nart also marks a new era in the conception of life and pictorial form.\r\nAn ardent love of truth and nature takes the place of the earlier vague\r\nidealism. At the same time, the realism of the brothers Van Eyck and\r\ntheir followers, notwithstanding its insistence on literal truth in\r\nthe representation of frequently ugly details, was kept in check by\r\ndeep sentiment, love of splendid colour, and a great sense of style in\r\ncomposition. Details, even in the far-away distance, were certainly\r\nelaborated with minute precision, but they are never unduly obtrusive,\r\nand are invariably subordinated to the main motive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JAN VAN EYCK\r\n\r\nThe earliest important Flemish painting in the Louvre is the famous\r\n_Virgin and Child with the Chancellor Rolin_ (No. 1986, Plate XVI.) by\r\nJan van Eyck (_c._ 1390-1441), which was taken by order of Napoleon\r\nI. from the Collegiate Church of Autun in Burgundy. In a three-aisled\r\ncolonnaded hall with stilted arches and pavement of geometrical inlay\r\nis seen Nicholas Rolin, Chancellor of Burgundy and Brabant, kneeling\r\nat a prayer-desk before the Virgin, on whose right knee is seated the\r\nInfant Saviour holding an orb in His left and raising His right hand\r\nin benediction. An angel with peacock-blue wings is floating above the\r\nVirgin and holding an elaborately wrought golden crown over her head.\r\nThe exquisite detail of the river landscape with a view of Maastricht\r\nextending beyond the open colonnade, the sumptuous brocaded dresses,\r\nthe carved capitals of columns and piers, and many other details\r\npainted with inimitable minute skill, help towards an ensemble of\r\njewel-like splendour dimmed but not marred by the yellow varnish which\r\ncovers the surface. The _Virgin with the Donor_ was formerly generally\r\nattributed to Hubert, but is most probably a late work by Jan van Eyck,\r\npainted perhaps about 1432.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SCHOOL OF TOURNAI\r\n\r\nNeither Petrus Christus (1412?-1473), the only master who was directly\r\ninfluenced by Jan van Eyck, nor Robert Campin (1365-1444), who is now\r\nknown to be identical with the so-called “Maître de Flémalle,” and\r\nwho was the head of the important Tournai school, are represented\r\nat the Louvre. The official Catalogue ascribes to Campin’s greatest\r\npupil, Rogier van der Weyden (_c._ 1400-1464), the two panels _The\r\nVirgin and Child_ (No. 2195), and _The Deposition from the Cross_ (No.\r\n2196), of which at least the former is only a school version of an\r\noften repeated theme by the master, whilst the _Deposition_ is by no\r\nmeans an important example of his work. Rogier was born at Tournai,\r\nbut went to Brussels after 1432, and practised in that city until his\r\ndeath in 1464. A journey to Italy in 1449 did not appreciably affect\r\nhis art, which always retained an archaic flavour, especially in the\r\nrather tortured rendering of the nude. In this respect, and also in\r\nhis utter disregard of beauty (except the beauty of rhythmic line), he\r\ncompares unfavourably with the brothers Van Eyck, as may be clearly\r\nseen on comparing his work with Jan van Eyck’s _Virgin and Donor_. His\r\noccasional use of gold backgrounds, as in the _Virgin and Child_ (No.\r\n2195), is another archaic trait.\r\n\r\nThe hand of a nameless contemporary and follower of Campin and Rogier\r\nvan der Weyden, who is also represented at the Galleries of Vienna,\r\nTurin, and Antwerp, is to be recognised in the small panel of _The\r\nAnnunciation_ (No. 2202), which was formerly attributed to the much\r\nlater painter Lucas van Leyden, and has also been claimed to be only a\r\ncopy of a picture by the Maître de Flémalle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HANS MEMLINC\r\n\r\nThe influence of Rogier van der Weyden determined the entire course\r\ntaken by the Flemish school until its decline with the introduction\r\nof those Italian Renaissance tendencies which only became a vital\r\nfactor and led to the birth of a new Flemish art through the genius of\r\nRubens. Again, Rogier’s chief pupil, Dierick Bouts (_c._ 1410-1475),\r\nis unrepresented at the Louvre. In the art of Hans Memlinc (_c._\r\n1430?-1494), who was the founder of the great school of Bruges, may be\r\nfound clear traces of the influence of Rogier and of Bouts, although\r\nwe have no certain knowledge as to that master’s actual pupilage. He\r\nmay have been born at Mömlingen, near Aschaffenburg on the Main, and\r\napparently had already risen to fame as a painter before 1467, the\r\ndate of his great altarpiece at Dantzig. By that time he was settled\r\nat Bruges. Mr. W. H. J. Weale’s researches have shown that the legend,\r\naccording to which Memlinc first came to Bruges as a wounded soldier\r\nand was nursed back to health at the Hospital of St. John, is not\r\nfounded on fact. It is probable that Memlinc served his apprenticeship\r\nunder some Cologne painter, but all theories regarding his early life\r\nmust remain largely conjectural.\r\n\r\nWhat is of real importance is that he introduced into the detailed\r\nrealism of his precursors a note of pious fervour and tender idealism,\r\nwhich is the nearest approach in Northern art to the angelic sweetness\r\nof Fra Giovanni da Fiesole. Not without good reason has he been called\r\n“the Fra Angelico of the North.” Fromentin was certainly right in\r\nsaying that “Van Eyck saw with his eyes, Memlinc begins to see with\r\nhis soul.” It is this warmth of feeling that makes Memlinc the most\r\nlovable painter of the Flemish school, for he could neither rival the\r\ndramatic power and realistic truth of the Van Eycks, nor the firm\r\ndraughtsmanship of Van der Weyden, nor Bouts’s skill in landscape\r\npainting. Nor did he take full advantage of the possibilities of the\r\noil technique, his method remaining that of the tempera painters,\r\nalthough he availed himself of the new medium.\r\n\r\nThe earliest work by Memlinc in the great French national collection\r\nis the charming little diptych, painted about 1475, and representing\r\non one leaf _The Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine_ (No. 2027), and\r\non the other _The Donor, John du Celier, presented by St. John_ (No.\r\n2027A). In the first the Virgin is seen seated in a flowering meadow in\r\nfront of a rose-covered trellis and supporting the Infant Christ, who\r\nbends forward to place the ring on the finger of St. Catherine on the\r\nleft. Behind the saintly bride are St. Agnes and St. Cecilia; whilst\r\nthe group on the right comprises St. Barbara, with St. Margaret and\r\nSt. Lucy, all accompanied by their characteristic attributes. On the\r\nother leaf the Donor is seen kneeling, with hands joined in prayer,\r\nin front of St. John the Baptist, who is pointing to Our Lord. The\r\nlandscape background shows, on the left, the Apocalyptic vision of St.\r\nJohn the Evangelist, and on the right, St. George fighting the Dragon.\r\nThis leaf, after passing through the collection of Mr. Herz and Mr.\r\nHeath, was presented to the Louvre in 1895 by Mme. André, and was thus\r\nreunited with its companion, which had been bequeathed to the Gallery\r\nfourteen years earlier by M. E. Gatteaux. It is on the whole in an\r\nexcellent state of preservation, although some of the accessories in\r\nthe background are so thinly painted that they have almost disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n               MEMLINC’S “VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH DONORS”\r\n\r\nAbout 1490 Memlinc must have painted the admirable _Virgin and Child,\r\nwith Donors_ (No. 2026), which was commissioned by James Floreins, a\r\nmember of the Bruges Merchant Grocers’ Guild, but subsequently found\r\nits way to Spain, whence it was taken to France by General d’Armagnac.\r\nThe Donor, who is kneeling on the left, in front of his seven sons,\r\nis presented by St. James the Great, the same office being performed\r\nby St. Dominic for Floreins’s wife and her twelve daughters, on\r\nthe opposite side. The scene is laid in a Romanesque church, with\r\nopenings at either side, through which glimpses of the landscape\r\nbeyond are obtained. The characterisation of all the faces, which\r\nbear a strong family likeness, is as admirable as the painting of the\r\nnoble architecture. Remarkable, too, is the effect of perfect symmetry\r\nobtained in the arrangement of the two unequal groups through the\r\nsimple device of placing the Virgin and Child more towards the less\r\ncrowded side, although the canopy is in the exact middle of the panel.\r\nThis altarpiece is certainly one of the most important works by Memlinc\r\nthat are to be found outside Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe two little panels, _St. John the Baptist_ (No. 2024), and _St. Mary\r\nMagdalene_ (No. 2025), both standing in a landscape with small scenes\r\nfrom their respective legends, formed originally, with two further\r\npanels representing St. Christopher and St. Stephen, the shutters of a\r\ntriptych. The centre part had disappeared before the wings, carefully\r\nsawn through the thickness of the panels so, as to separate the obverse\r\nfrom the reverse, came into the possession of Lucien Bonaparte, and\r\nafterwards of William II. of Holland. The two Saints now at the Louvre\r\nwere purchased in 1851 for £469.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the Louvre obtained, at the high price of £8000, the _Portrait\r\nof an Old Lady_ (Plate XVII.), to which attention was first drawn\r\nat the Bruges Exhibition in 1902, when it was shown by M. Nardus,\r\nfrom whom it passed into the hands of M. Kleinberger. Both the Paris\r\nportrait, which is drawn with exquisite precision but has apparently\r\nsuffered from over-cleaning, and its companion, the portrait of this\r\nanonymous lady’s husband at the Berlin Museum, were until 1884 in the\r\nMeazzu collection in Milan.\r\n\r\nThe triptych (No. 2028) with (_a_) _The Resurrection_, (_b_) _The\r\nAscension_, and (_c_) _The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian_, which was\r\nbought at Turin in 1860 for £540, and is officially considered to be\r\nof doubtful authenticity, is included by Mr. Weale in his catalogue of\r\nMemlinc’s works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GERARD DAVID\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction and the rescuing from oblivion of the artistic\r\npersonality of Gerard David, begun by Mr. Weale and completed by\r\nFreiherr von Bodenhausen, is one of the triumphs of the modern\r\nscientific method of criticism. The Louvre is fortunate in possessing\r\ntwo important examples from the brush of this master, who, born\r\nat Ouwater in Holland about 1460, was in his early studies influenced\r\nby Albert van Ouwater, but, after settling at Bruges in 1483, came\r\nunder the spell of Van Eyck, Bouts, and above all of Memlinc, whom he\r\nsucceeded as leader of the Bruges school. On his death in 1523, the\r\nsupremacy of that school came to an end, and passed on to the city of\r\nAntwerp, which by that time had also superseded Bruges as a commercial\r\ncentre. Gerard David was not Memlinc’s equal as regards intimate charm,\r\nbut in his work is to be found a summing-up of all the achievement of\r\nthe Flemish Quattrocento—“the last concentrated expression of the aims\r\nof all the great masters of that fertile age.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                       PLATE XVII.—HANS MEMLINC\r\n\r\n                             (1430?-1494)\r\n\r\n                         EARLY FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                   No.—[4].—PORTRAIT OF AN OLD LADY\r\n\r\n  She is seen in full face and at half-length, wearing the costume of\r\n  the period; her hands are superposed; landscape background to the\r\n  left, with a winding sandy path.

(0·36 × 0·30.)]\r\n\r\n  [4] This picture has not yet received an official number.\r\n\r\nAfter having been successively attributed to Van Eyck, Van der Weyden,\r\nMemlinc, and David’s pupil Ysenbrant, the _Marriage at Cana_ (No.\r\n1957, Plate XVIII.) is now generally admitted to be designed and\r\npartly executed by Gerard David, although the panel shows unmistakable\r\nevidence of being completed by another and less skilful hand. Mr. Weale\r\nhas shown, on the strength of a certain document, that the picture may\r\nhave been finished by Ysenbrant, but he has been unable to establish\r\nthat the document quoted by him refers to this particular picture.\r\nThere can be no doubt that David himself painted the figure of the\r\nDonor, kneeling on the left, a marvellous example of early portraiture,\r\nand the Donor’s son, the Christ, and the boy carrying the cake. Some of\r\nthe other heads are almost wooden in their hardness. The head of the\r\nDominican looking into the hall through an opening beyond which is to\r\nbe seen the Place du Saint-Sang, at Bruges, is clearly an afterthought,\r\nand is introduced so clumsily that the wall and the page-boy with the\r\ncake-dish really leave no room for the friar’s body. There is a curious\r\nlack of spiritual cohesion in the picture—the majority of the figures\r\nlook away from the Saviour as well as from the bride, although the\r\nsignificance of the moment is such as to demand a concentration of\r\neverybody’s attention on the Christ. The picture, of which there are\r\nseveral replicas, notably one at the Stockholm Museum by David’s pupil\r\nAmbrosius Benson, was until 1580 in the Chapel of the Saint-Sang at\r\nBruges, and then in the collection of Louis XIV., from which it passed\r\ninto the Louvre.\r\n\r\nThe triptych (No. 2202A) of the _Virgin and Child, with Two Angels_,\r\nin the centre, and _Two Donors presented by St. John the Baptist and\r\nSt. John the Evangelist_, on the wings, is officially catalogued as\r\nan anonymous picture of the Flemish sixteenth-century school, but is\r\nunquestionably an early work of Gerard David. It is interesting to note\r\nthat the male Donor is the same as the Donor in the _Marriage at Cana_,\r\nthough younger in years, and that the delightful and strangely Italian\r\n_putti_ on the capitals of the columns that flank the Virgin’s throne\r\nrecur again, reversed, in David’s _Judgment of Cambyses_, at Bruges.\r\nThe _Adam_ and _Eve_ on the outside of the shutters are inspired by the\r\ncorresponding figures on the great Van Eyck altarpiece at Ghent. The\r\nLouvre triptych was bought at the Garriga sale in Madrid, in 1890, for\r\n£248.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HIERONYMUS BOSCH\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the school founded at Antwerp by Quentin Matsys\r\n(_c._ 1466-1530), mention should be made of Hieronymus Bosch van Aeken\r\n(_c._ 1462-1516), who, a follower of Ouwater, has as much right to\r\nbe counted among the masters of the Dutch as of the Flemish school.\r\nOf his life we know but little. His pictures reveal that realistic\r\nobservation of everyday life which was to become the characteristic of\r\nthe Dutch school; but, added to it, there is a tendency towards the\r\ngrotesque which made him delight in subjects that gave him full scope\r\nfor the invention of weird monsters, devils, and spectres, such as the\r\ndemons in _The Damned_ (No. 1900), which is attributed to Bosch in\r\nthe official Catalogue, but is, like its companion, _Heaven_, at\r\nthe Lille Museum, the work of the unknown painter of the famous _Last\r\nJudgment_ at Dantzig, which has by various experts been given in turn\r\nto Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, and Memlinc. There is at the\r\nLouvre a drawing which corresponds to so remarkable a degree with the\r\npanel No. 1900, that it has long been held to be a study from the same\r\nhand. This drawing is, however, more probably an early study by the\r\nGerman master Martin Schöngauer after the Louvre panel. The picture was\r\nformerly in the Duchâtel collection, and was given to the Louvre by the\r\nDuc de la Tremoïlle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                       PLATE XVIII.—GERARD DAVID\r\n\r\n                             (1460?-1523)\r\n\r\n                         EARLY FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                    No. 1957.—THE MARRIAGE AT CANA\r\n\r\n                          (Les Noces de Cana)\r\n\r\n  The scene takes place in a richly appointed chamber, which on the\r\n  left side looks out on to the Place du Saint-Sang at Bruges. The\r\n  Bride is seated on the farther side of the table; towards the left\r\n  the Virgin bows her head in the direction of the Christ.

Neither _The Saviour Blessing_ (No. 2030) nor _The\r\nVirgin and Child_ (No. 2030A), both of which are catalogued under his\r\nname, can be accepted as authentic; but the interesting genre group of\r\n_The Banker and his Wife_ is not only fully signed and dated\r\n\r\n                    QVENTIN MATSYS, SCHILDER, 1514,\r\n\r\nbut is unmistakably the work of his brush, although the woman’s face\r\nand hands appear to have been badly repainted. It was bought in 1806 at\r\nthe low price of £72. The best version of the same subject is the one\r\nin the Sigmaringen Gallery. By Quentin Matsys is also, probably, the\r\n_Pietà_ (No. 2203), which is catalogued officially as “Flemish XVIth\r\nCentury.” Quentin’s son Jan, who followed his father’s tradition and\r\nachieved considerable distinction, is the painter of the hideous _David\r\nand Bathsheba_ (No. 2030B), which bears the inscription\r\n\r\n                    1562. IOANES MASSIIS PINGEBAT.\r\n\r\nNext in importance among the Antwerp masters is Jan Gossart (_c._\r\n1470-1533?), better known as Mabuse, from the name of his native town\r\nMaubeuge in the Hainault. In his early work he followed the tradition\r\nof the great masters of his own country, but a journey to Italy in\r\n1508 made him change his manner, and led him to adopt, together with\r\nthe amplitude of Italian design, a certain floridness which compares\r\nunfavourably with the honest realism of his precursors and which led to\r\nthe rapid decadence of the Flemish school. In the magnificent portrait\r\nof _Jean Carondelet, Perpetual Chancellor of Flanders_ (No. 1997, Plate\r\nXX.), although it was painted as late as 1517, he is still faithful\r\nto the great tradition of his country for honest, straightforward,\r\nshrewdly observed, and delicately wrought portraiture. An inscription\r\non the top of the arched gilt frame reads:\r\n\r\n              REPRÉSENTACION DE MESSIRE JEHAN CARONDELET,\r\n             HAVLT DOYEN DE BESANÇON, EN SON EAGE DE 48Ā,\r\n\r\nand, below, “FAIT L’AN 1517.” In a niche behind the panel are the\r\nletters “I C” entwined with strings, and the motto “MATVRA.” The\r\nportrait was, therefore, obviously painted just before Carondelet\r\naccompanied Charles V. to Spain in 1517.\r\n\r\nThis portrait panel, together with _The Virgin and Child_ (No. 1998),\r\nwhich bears on the frame the inscription\r\n\r\n                  MEDIATRIX NOSTRA QVE EST POST DEVM\r\n                  SPES SOLA TVO FILIO ME REPRESENTA,\r\n\r\nand the signature “JOHANNES MELBODIE PINGEBAT,” formed a\r\ndiptych which was bought in 1847 from a Valenciennes architect for\r\nthe ridiculous price of £40! A later portrait of Carondelet by\r\nMabuse, dated 1531, appeared in 1907 at Christie’s under the name of\r\nC. Amberger, and realised the price of £3885. Another portrait of\r\nCarondelet, by B. van Orley, is in the Munich Gallery, where it is\r\nofficially ascribed to Quentin Matsys, who is probably the painter\r\nof yet another portrait of the Chancellor which was recently in the\r\nDuchâtel collection in Paris. The _Portrait of a Benedictine_ (No.\r\n1999) bears the date 1526 and the signature\r\n\r\n                         JOANNE MALBOLD PINGE.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the Antwerp school through the introduction of Italian\r\nmannerisms is illustrated in _Young Tobias restoring Sight to his\r\nFather_ (No. 2001), a fully signed late picture by Jan van Hemessen,\r\nwho flourished in that city towards the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and in whose art the last traces of the great national\r\ntradition disappear.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                       PLATE XIX.—QUENTIN MATSYS\r\n\r\n                             (1466?-1530)\r\n\r\n                            FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                   No. 2029.—THE BANKER AND HIS WIFE\r\n\r\n                       (Le Banquier et sa femme)\r\n\r\n  On the far side of a table covered with a green cloth and strewn\r\n  with various objects, which include a crystal cup and a circular\r\n  mirror, are seated the banker, wearing a dark blue robe edged with\r\n  fur, and his wife who is turning over the leaves of an illuminated\r\n  book of hours.

The signed wing was\r\npresented to the Gallery in 1903; whilst the _Trinity_ centre-piece was\r\nbought two years later from the Abbé Toussaint at St. Omer for £120.\r\n\r\nLike Mabuse, Barend van Orley, after showing in his early work clear\r\ntraces of his descent from the Flemish primitives, drank deeply at the\r\nfountain of Italian art. He was profoundly impressed by Raphael, from\r\nwhom he endeavoured, with a certain degree of success, to learn the\r\nnoble flow of drapery and the harmonious disposition of the design. On\r\nthe other hand, he sacrificed the lustrous richness of Early Flemish\r\ncolour and became addicted to dull grey shadows and pinkish lights.\r\nHis _Holy Family_ (No. 2067A) does not rank with his finest works,\r\n_The Last Judgment_ at Antwerp and the _Holy Family_ at Liverpool. The\r\narchitectural setting, with a statue of Neptune in a square in the\r\nbackground, indicates the advent of the Renaissance. The picture was\r\nbought at the Otlet sale in Brussels, in 1902, for £540. With Barend\r\nvan Orley closes the chapter of the Early Flemish school. Indeed, he\r\nwas rather the first of the new era than the last of the primitives.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                         PLATE XX.—JAN MABUSE\r\n\r\n                             (1470?-1533?)\r\n\r\n                         EARLY FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n      No. 1997.—PORTRAIT OF JEAN CARONDELET, PERPETUAL CHANCELLOR\r\n                              OF FLANDERS\r\n\r\n     (Portrait de Jean Carondelet, chancelier perpétuel de Flandre\r\n                             (1469-1544))\r\n\r\n  He is bare-headed and wears a blue robe; he is turned\r\n  three-quarters to the right; his hands are folded in prayer.\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on panel.\r\n\r\n  Inscribed on the frame:—“REPRÉSENTACION DE MESSIRE JEHAN\r\n  CARONDELET, HAVLT DOYEN DE BESANÇON, EN SON EAGE DE 48Ā,” and,\r\n  below, “FAIT L’AN 1517.”\r\n\r\n  1 ft. 5 in. × 10¾ in. (0·43 × 0·27.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE LATE FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period of the great struggle of the Netherlands for religious and\r\npolitical independence from the yoke of Spain and the Inquisition\r\nwas not propitious for the fostering of the Fine Arts. Not only did\r\nthe troubled provinces, as was quite natural, slacken in artistic\r\nproduction, but a vast portion of the treasures owned by churches\r\nand monastic establishments were destroyed by the fanaticism of\r\nProtestant iconoclasts. The separation of the Protestant North from\r\nthe Catholic South by the Utrecht Union in 1579 became in a way the\r\ndetermining factor for the future course of painting in Holland and\r\nin the Belgic provinces. The Dutchmen practically had no further use\r\nfor religious painting, and devoted themselves more exclusively to the\r\ndomestic genre, portraiture, and landscape; whilst the Flemings applied\r\nthemselves largely to infusing new vitality into the representation\r\nof Scriptural characters and incidents which, through constant\r\nmechanical repetition, had become mere allegorical hieroglyphics, or\r\ngeneralised ideas without the all-important sense of pulsating life.\r\nThis regeneration was the great deed of Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640),\r\nwho, whilst still benefiting from the example of the great Italians,\r\nremained the very embodiment of Flemish character and thought, and\r\nbecame the founder of the second important period of Flemish national\r\nart. He was a man of exuberant vitality and boundless energy, endowed\r\nwith a creative force unequalled in the whole history of art. He must\r\nrank for all time among the very giants of the brush, with Rembrandt,\r\nTitian, and Velazquez, his contribution to the progress in pictorial\r\nart being the use of pigment and sweeping brushwork as a constructive\r\nelement—an advance as significant as the Venetians’ admission of\r\nlight into the pictorial scheme, which with the Florentines was based\r\nentirely on linear design.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PIETER BRUEGHEL\r\n\r\nBut before considering the magnificent array of close on fifty\r\nauthentic works by the master which form part of the French national\r\ncollection, reference will have to be made to a few Flemish artists\r\nof the singularly barren decades that precede the advent of Rubens.\r\nFirst and foremost among these is Pieter Brueghel (or Breughel) the\r\nElder (1530-1569), who was born at Breda in 1530, became a pupil of\r\nPieter Koeck, and died at Brussels in 1569. In spite of his early\r\ntravels in Italy—which were then already considered indispensable for\r\nthe completion of an artist’s training—he remained unaffected by the\r\nall-pervading Italian influence. He was pure Flemish in thought and\r\nexpression, and devoted himself to the realistic painting of peasant\r\nlife. Certain realistic features which make his pictures sometimes\r\nappear obscene and coarse to modern eyes are merely an expression of\r\nthe humour of his age. The exquisite little painting, _The Beggars_\r\n(No. 1917), which is fully signed\r\n\r\n                      PETER BRUEGHEL, M D L VIII,\r\n\r\nis probably some satirical political allusion to the revolutionary\r\nparty who called themselves the _Gueux_ (beggars). A similar political\r\nsignificance is probably the intention of _The Parable of the Blind_\r\n(No. 1917A). The single file of blind men following their blind\r\nleaders into a river is meant to satirise the moral blindness of the\r\nartist’s compatriots following their political leaders into disaster.\r\nThis excellent version of Brueghel’s famous masterpiece at Naples\r\nwas bought at the Leys sale at Antwerp, in 1894, for £724. The type\r\nof picture to which the elder Brueghel owes his sobriquet “Peasant\r\nBrueghel” is exemplified at the Louvre by two little panels, _A\r\nVillage_ (No. 1918) and _Peasants Dancing_ (No. 1918A), which can,\r\nhowever, only be accepted as school pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JAN BRUEGHEL\r\n\r\nOf Brueghel’s two sons, Pieter the younger, known as “Hell” Brueghel,\r\nis not represented at the Louvre, which, on the other hand, boasts\r\npossession of eight examples from the brush of “Peasant” Brueghel’s\r\nsecond son, Jan (1568-1625), known to fame as “Velvet” Brueghel, either\r\nowing to his love of splendid apparel or to the velvety softness of his\r\nbrush. He began as a still-life and flower painter, in which capacity\r\nhe often collaborated with Rubens. Having journeyed to Rome in 1593, he\r\ndevoted himself more exclusively to landscape enlivened with many small\r\nfigures, for which some Scriptural or mythological subject generally\r\nprovided the excuse. Where his pictures contain figures on a larger\r\nscale, they are generally put in by Rubens, Rottenhammer, or Van Balen.\r\nThe last-named is certainly responsible for the figures in _Air_ (No.\r\n1920), one of a series of the Four Elements, painted by Jan Brueghel\r\nfor his Roman patron, Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, in 1621. To the same\r\nseries belongs _Earth_, or _The Earthly Paradise_ (No. 1919), a subject\r\noften repeated by him, as for instance in the versions at The Hague\r\nand at Budapest. Of his other pictures at the Louvre _The Bridge of\r\nTalavera_ (No. 1925), and the _Landscape_ (No. 1926), are signed and\r\ndated BRUEGHEL, 1619, and J. BRUEGHEL, 1620, respectively. _The Battle\r\nof Arbela_ (No. 1921) is a characteristic work with many minutely\r\nwrought figures. The _Landscapes_ (Nos. 1923 and 1924) are of doubtful\r\nauthenticity, and were formerly attributed to Paul Bril. They are not\r\nnow exhibited.\r\n\r\nThere are scarcely any Flemish characteristics in the art of Paul\r\nBril (1556-1626), the younger brother and pupil of Matthias Bril. He\r\nwas born at Antwerp, but worked nearly all his life in Rome. There is\r\nlittle to distinguish this precursor of Poussin in the art of landscape\r\nfrom his Italian contemporaries. In _Duck Shooting_ (No. 1908), _Diana\r\nand her Nymphs_ (No. 1909), and _Pan and Syrinx_ (No. 1911) the figures\r\nare believed to have been painted in by Annibale Carracci. _The\r\nFishermen_ (No. 1910) bears his signature PA. BRILLI, and the date 1624.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE FRANCK FAMILY\r\n\r\nAlthough the Louvre owns no picture by Frans Floris, the head of the\r\nItalianising mid-sixteenth-century Antwerp school, his uninteresting\r\nstyle may be studied in _The Story of Esther_ (No. 1989) by his pupil\r\nFrans Franck (1542-1616). To that second-rate artist’s son, Frans\r\nFranck the Younger (1581-1642), who already benefited to a certain\r\nextent by the example of Rubens, is given in the official Catalogue\r\n_Ulysses recognising Achilles among the Daughters of Lycomedes_ (No.\r\n1991A). _The Parable of the Prodigal Son_ (No. 1990), which is also\r\ncatalogued under his name, is obviously by his son Frans Franck III.,\r\nsince the date 1663 precedes the signature, and F. Franck the younger\r\ndied in 1642.\r\n\r\nFrans Pourbus the Younger (1569-1622) was born at Antwerp, but spent\r\nthe later part of his life in Paris, where, like his father, he enjoyed\r\nconsiderable reputation as a portrait painter. He had previously been\r\nworking at the Mantuan Court, and became painter to Marie de Médicis\r\nafter 1609. Although he occasionally produced altarpieces like the\r\nrather uninspired _Last Supper_ (No. 2068) and _St. Francis receiving\r\nthe Stigmata_ (No. 2069), he was essentially a portrait painter. In\r\nthis capacity he belongs rather to the age that was coming to a close\r\nthan to the new era initiated by Rubens. His portraits are quite\r\nsoundly painted, rich in colour, and convincing as likenesses, but lack\r\ndepth of character and suavity of touch. By far his best pictures at\r\nthe Louvre are the _Portrait of Henri IV._ (No. 2071) and the large\r\n_Portrait of Marie de Médicis_ (No. 2072), in which the details of\r\nthe costume are particularly noteworthy. Less important is another\r\n_Portrait of Henri IV._ (No. 2070), and one of _Guillaume du Vair_ (No.\r\n2074).\r\n\r\nOctavius van Veen, or Otto Venius (1558-1629), the painter of _The\r\nArtist and his Family_ (No. 2191), owes his fame more to the fact that\r\nhe was one of the three masters under whom Rubens studied than to any\r\nintrinsic merit of his art.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PETER PAUL RUBENS\r\n\r\nThe Louvre owes its almost unequalled wealth in paintings by Rubens to\r\nthe master’s relations with Marie de Médicis and her Court; and to this\r\nreason is due the fact that by far the largest portion of the fifty-one\r\nauthentic works wholly or partly from his brush, which now form part of\r\nthis great collection, date approximately from, or immediately before\r\nand after, the time during which he was busy with the famous series\r\npainted by order of that queen for the decoration of the Luxembourg\r\nPalace, and now to be seen in a setting appropriate to their florid\r\nsumptuousness in the new Rubens Gallery at the Louvre. Even so, the\r\ncollection comprises examples of every phase of the master’s colossal\r\nactivity—religious and historical compositions, allegorical paintings,\r\nlandscapes, portraits, still life, and even _genre_-pieces, like the\r\n_Kermesse_ (No. 2115), in which he successfully competes with Teniers\r\non a ground peculiarly his own.\r\n\r\nBorn at Siegen in 1577, Rubens received his artistic education at\r\nAntwerp from Tobias Verhaecht, a landscape painter, Adam van Noort,\r\nand O. van Veen. At the age of twenty-three he went to Italy and\r\nentered the service of Vincenzo Gonzaga of Mantua, studying in their\r\nown country the works of the great Italian masters, and especially the\r\nVenetians, from whose glorious colour he derived more benefit than\r\nfrom his early training. With the exception of a journey to the Court\r\nof Philip III. at Madrid, where he was sent on a mission by the Duke\r\nof Mantua in 1603, Rubens spent the eight years from 1600 to 1608 in\r\nthe various Italian centres, and especially in Rome, where he painted,\r\nabout 1606, the little _Landscape with Ruins_ (No. 2119), which is\r\nof interest not only as showing to what degree he was at that time\r\ninfluenced by the Roman school, and by the Carracci, but also as being\r\nthe very first landscape known to have been produced by him. The same\r\nview of the Palatine Hill is to be recognised in the background of\r\nthe _Four Philosophers_ at the Pitti Palace, and in the portrait of\r\nWoverius in the Arenberg collection. Of about the same time, though the\r\nfigures would appear to have been added at a considerably later date,\r\nis the _Landscape with a Rainbow_ (No. 2118).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RUBENS AT ANTWERP\r\n\r\nHaving returned to Antwerp in 1608, and married his first wife,\r\nIsabella Brant, in the following year, Rubens, who was now made Court\r\npainter to Archduke Albrecht, entered upon a period of stupendous\r\nartistic activity, which extended to about 1621, when he began to\r\ndivide his time between art and diplomatic missions, and, having\r\npreviously organised a vast studio with an army of assistants, often\r\nleft the execution of his brilliant sketch designs to less capable\r\nhands. This early Antwerp period is not particularly well represented\r\nat the Louvre, although the collection includes _The Virgin surrounded\r\nby the Holy Innocents_ (No. 2078)— a Virgin of characteristic\r\nFlemish coarseness and fulness of form, in the midst of a dense swarm\r\nof delicious, plump, dimpled, wingless angel-children, whose rosy\r\nbaby-flesh is painted with inimitable mastery. The picture was painted\r\nabout 1615, six years before _The Virgin and Child within a Garland of\r\nFlowers_ (No. 2079), executed in 1621 for Cardinal Federigo Borromeo.\r\nThe tasteless floral wreath in this picture, as in the similar versions\r\nat Munich and New York, is from the brush of Jan Brueghel. To about\r\nthe year 1615 belongs also the _Christ on the Cross, with the Virgin,\r\nthe Magdalen and St. John_ (No. 2082), which can, however, hardly be\r\nentirely from the master’s own hand. The mass of unbroken vermilion\r\nin the robe of St. John is one of Rubens’s favourite devices at that\r\nperiod. _The Resurrection of Lazarus_ (No. 2081) is the original sketch\r\nfor the Berlin picture.\r\n\r\nIn 1620, when Rubens undertook to paint a series of thirty-nine\r\n_Miracles of SS. Ignatius Loyola and François Xavier_ for the ceiling\r\nof the Jesuit Church at Antwerp, the business-like organisation of his\r\nstudio was an acknowledged fact, as may be gathered from the terms of\r\nthe agreement which stipulated that the master himself should provide\r\nthe designs, though the execution was to be entrusted to his most\r\ncompetent assistants. The actual paintings were destroyed by fire in\r\n1718, but of the original sketches seventeen have been preserved, and\r\nare now distributed between the Louvre, the Vienna Academy, the Museums\r\nof Gotha and Brussels, and the Dulwich Gallery. The four in the La Caze\r\ncollection at the Louvre are _Abraham’s Sacrifice_ (No. 2120), _Abraham\r\nand Melchisedek_ (No. 2121), _The Elevation of the Cross_ (No. 2122),\r\nand _The Coronation of the Virgin_ (No. 2123). The whole series, but\r\nespecially the first two of these, is remarkable for the boldness of\r\nthe foreshortening, calculated for the position of the panels on the\r\nceiling, and for the swift bravura and inimitable expressiveness of the\r\nbrushwork. To the same period belongs _Philopœmen recognised by an Old\r\nWoman_ (No. 2124), which is essentially a brilliant still-life study\r\nfor a lost picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE MÉDICIS SERIES\r\n\r\nWe come now to the series of twenty-one large allegorical paintings,\r\ndesigned by Rubens and executed mostly by his pupils, from 1621 to\r\n1625, for the decoration of the Luxembourg Palace for Marie de Médicis,\r\nwhose by no means inspiring career had to furnish the subjects for\r\nthe series. It was a thankless task which could only be accomplished\r\nby a _tour de force_—by removing the events of the queen’s life from\r\nactuality into the sphere of mythology and allegory. That the strange\r\nmingling of the real and the ideal should sometimes verge on the\r\ngrotesque was almost inevitable—as inevitable as that the work of\r\nhis assistants should have failed to do full justice to the master’s\r\nconception, even if it was “pulled together” by the easily recognisable\r\ntouches added by Rubens to the finished panels. The florid exuberance\r\nof design and colour was entirely in keeping with the purpose and the\r\nsurroundings for which the paintings were intended. It is impossible\r\nhere to enter into a full description of this extensive series, or\r\nto define exactly Rubens’s share in each of the eleven pictures. We\r\nmust confine ourselves to the brief enumeration of the subjects in\r\nthe order in which they are now to be seen in the new Rubens Gallery.\r\nThe series begins with _The Fates spinning the Destiny of Marie de\r\nMédicis_ (No. 2085). Then follow _The Triumph of Truth_ (No. 2105);\r\n_Henri IV. receiving the Portrait of Marie_ (No. 2088); _The Marriage\r\nof Marie by Procuration with Henri IV._ (No. 2089); _Marie landing at\r\nMarseilles, Nov. 3, 1600_ (No. 2090); _The Marriage at Lyons, Dec. 10,\r\n1600_ (No. 2091); _The Birth of Louis XIII. at Fontainebleau, Sept.\r\n27, 1601_ (No. 2092); _Henri IV. leaves for the War with Germany and\r\nentrusts the Government to the Queen_ (No. 2093, Plate XXI.); _The\r\nCoronation of the Queen_ (No. 2094); _Apotheosis of Henri IV. and the\r\nQueen’s Regency_ (No. 2095); _The Queen’s Journey to Ponts-de-Cé_ (No.\r\n2097); _Exchange of the Two Princesses, Nov. 9, 1615_ (No. 2098); _The\r\nProsperous Regency_ (No. 2099); _The Majority of Louis XIII._ (No.\r\n2100); _The Queen’s Nocturnal Flight from Blois_ (No. 2101); _The\r\nReconciliation of the Queen with her Son_ (No. 2102); _The Conclusion\r\nof Peace_ (No. 2103); and _Marie’s Interview with her Son_ (No. 2104).\r\nBut _The Birth of Marie de Médicis, at Florence, on April 26, 1575_\r\n(No. 2086); _The Education of Marie by Minerva, Mercury, Apollo, and\r\nthe Graces_ (No. 2087); and _The Gods in Olympus protecting the Queen’s\r\nGovernment_ (No. 2096), which belong to the same series, have been\r\nplaced in another room.\r\n\r\nOf the first and the last paintings the Louvre owns the original\r\nsketch on one panel, by Rubens, for _The Triumph of Truth_ and _The\r\nFates spinning the Destiny of Marie_ (No. 2110), the other preliminary\r\nsketches being at the Hermitage and the Munich Gallery. It is\r\ninteresting to note that all these sketches are designed in a very\r\nlight key, almost in grisaille, with touches of rose and other tender\r\ncolour notes, so that apparently Rubens’s assistants were allowed great\r\nliberty in the matter of colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MÉDICIS PORTRAITS\r\n\r\nSeveral other pictures by Rubens at the Louvre—all of them\r\nportraits—are more or less directly connected with the Médicis series,\r\nand were painted between 1621 and 1625. These are the _Portrait of\r\nAnne of Austria_ (No. 2112), which was formerly known as _Elizabeth of\r\nBourbon_; the _Portrait of Francesco de’ Medici_ (No. 2106), Grand Duke\r\nof Tuscany, and father of Marie de Médicis, which was painted for the\r\nLuxembourg Gallery; the _Portrait of Johanna of Austria_ (No. 2107),\r\ndaughter of the Emperor Ferdinand, and wife of Francesco de’ Medici;\r\nthe _Portraits of Marie de Médicis_ (Nos. 2108 and 2109) (the former in\r\nthe character of Bellona, and both studio works with the final touches\r\nadded by the master); and the _Portrait of Baron Henri de Vicq_ (No.\r\n2111), who, as Flemish Ambassador to the French Court, was instrumental\r\nin procuring Rubens the important commission for the Luxembourg\r\npictures. This admirable portrait was bought at the King of Holland’s\r\nsale in 1850 for £637.\r\n\r\nTo the same period belongs the beautiful _Portrait of Susanne Fourment_\r\n(Rubens’s handsome, large-eyed sister-in-law, whose features are best\r\nknown from the _Chapeau de Paille_ at the National Gallery), which\r\nis still officially catalogued as _Portrait of a Lady of the Boonen\r\nFamily_ (No. 2114); and the important composition _Lot’s Flight from\r\nSodom_ (No. 2075), which bears the rare full signature and date\r\n\r\n  PE.-PA.-RUBENS FE, Aᵒ 1625,\r\n\r\nto prove the master’s satisfaction with his own handiwork. It is a\r\ndesign of carefully studied rhythm, dramatic expressiveness, and subtly\r\nharmonised colour, carried out with the swift sureness of his later\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn 1627, a year before his mission to Spain on behalf of the Infanta\r\nIsabella, widow of the Archduke Albrecht, Rubens designed for his\r\npatroness an important series of tapestries, which were, as was his\r\nwont at that period, sketched out by him, executed by his assistants,\r\nand touched up by his own hand. The tapestries were subsequently\r\npresented by the Infanta to a convent at Madrid; some of the paintings\r\nfor them perished by fire, others were preserved at the Convent of\r\nLoeches, near Madrid. Two of these, _The Prophet Elijah in the Desert_\r\n(No. 2076) and _The Triumph of Religion_ (No. 2083), were part of\r\nGeneral Sebastiani’s loot from Spain, and were bought by the Louvre for\r\n£2400; whilst four others, now at Grosvenor House, were bought\r\nby the Marquis of Westminster for £10,500. Of about the same date is\r\nthe brilliant _Adoration of the Magi_ (No. 2077), with its Titianesque\r\nscheme of strong red, blue, and golden yellow, of which a replica is in\r\nan Irish private collection.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                   PLATE XXI.—SIR PETER PAUL RUBENS\r\n\r\n                              (1577-1640)\r\n\r\n                            FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n No. 2093.—HENRI IV.

(3·94 × 2·95.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LATE WORKS BY RUBENS\r\n\r\nThe closing decade of Rubens’s life is represented by five pictures\r\nof considerable importance. Of _Queen Tomyris with the Head of Cyrus_\r\n(No. 2084) there is an earlier, large, and deservedly famous version in\r\nLord Darnley’s collection; but the Louvre picture exceeds it in beauty\r\nof design and in unity of colour. It was painted about the same time\r\n(_cca._ 1632) as _Religion crowned by a Genius_ (No. 2126), one of the\r\nsketches for the ceiling at Whitehall. Of peculiar interest, owing to\r\nits unfinished state which reveals the master’s method of portraiture,\r\nis the superb portrait group of _Hélène Fourment, the Artist’s Second\r\nWife, and Two of her Children_ (No. 2113, Plate XXII.). Only the heads,\r\nwhich are remarkable for an intensity of expression that is rarely to\r\nbe found in Rubens’s paintings, are finished. All the rest is loosely\r\nand thinly sketched in sepia heightened with swift touches of brighter\r\ncolour. It was painted about 1636, which is also the approximate date\r\nof _A Flemish Kermesse_ (No. 2115), an almost unique instance of the\r\nmaster applying the exuberant energy of his magic brush to a subject in\r\nwhich the expression of intense vitality and full-blooded sensuousness\r\nassumes the aspect almost of bestiality—which, however, in no way\r\ndetracts from the artistic value of the painting. To turn from this to\r\n_A Joust by the Moat of a Castle_ (No. 2116) is to pass from coarse\r\nrealism to pure romanticism, inspired probably by the associations of\r\nthe picturesque Castle of Steen, which Rubens had bought in 1635, and\r\nwhich forms the setting for this scene of knightly prowess. This, and\r\nthe marvellous and strangely modern little _Landscape_ (No. 2117), in\r\nwhich the morning sun is seen rising from the autumnal mist, belong to\r\nthe closing years of Rubens’s life. He died at Antwerp on May 20, 1640.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ANTHONY VAN DYCK\r\n\r\nBorn at Antwerp in 1599, Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), after having\r\nworked a few years under Hendrick van Balen, entered Rubens’s\r\nstudio in 1615, and soon became so conversant with the method of\r\nhis famous master, that he was at an early age entrusted with the\r\nexecution of important designs. Before he had reached his twentieth\r\nyear he was a member of the Guild of St. Luke, and had acquired a\r\nreputation second only to that of Rubens himself. The _Portraits of\r\nJean Grusset Richardot, President of the Netherlands Council, and\r\nhis Son_ (No. 1985), which was bought in 1784 for 16,001 _livres_,\r\nso closely resembles the work of Rubens, especially in the brilliant\r\nflesh-painting, that the picture—a posthumous portrait, by the way—for\r\na long time passed under the elder master’s name, although it is now\r\nadmitted by the best authorities to be an early picture by Van Dyck.\r\n\r\nVan Dyck paid a short visit to England in 1620. He went to Italy in the\r\nfollowing year, studying the works of the great masters, and especially\r\nof Titian, and finally settling in Genoa, where he remained until his\r\nreturn to Antwerp in 1628. During these years he devoted himself almost\r\nexclusively to portraiture, in which he endeavoured successfully to\r\nemulate the golden warmth of colour which had drawn him towards Titian.\r\nUnfortunately this, to some the most attractive, phase of Van Dyck’s\r\nart is but indifferently shown at the Louvre, the only example being a\r\n_Portrait of a Man_ (No. 1976).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                   PLATE XXII.—SIR PETER PAUL RUBENS\r\n\r\n                              (1577-1640)\r\n\r\n                            FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n   No. 2113.—PORTRAIT OF HÉLÈNE FOURMENT, THE ARTIST’S SECOND WIFE,\r\n                        AND TWO OF HER CHILDREN\r\n\r\n      (Portrait d’Hélène Fourment, seconde femme de Rubens, et de\r\n                             ses enfants)\r\n\r\n  The artist’s second wife, wearing a felt hat trimmed with feathers,\r\n  is seated in an arm-chair, and turned three-quarters to the left;\r\n  on her lap is her little son, François; on the left her daughter,\r\n  Claire-Jeanne, dressed in brown, plays with her white pinafore.\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on panel. The picture is unfinished.\r\n\r\n  5 ft. 8¾ in. × 2 ft. 8½ in. (1·13 × 0·82.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   VAN DYCK’S SECOND ANTWERP PERIOD\r\n\r\nSome of the master’s most precious works at the Louvre belong to his\r\nsecond Antwerp period, which extended from his return from Genoa in\r\n1628 to his departure for England in 1632. It was probably then that he\r\npainted _The Virgin and Child, with the Penitent Sinners_ (No. 1961)\r\n(Mary Magdalen, David, and the Prodigal Son), in which the influence of\r\nthe Venetian colourists is so clearly to be noticed. Indeed, the bosom\r\nof the female penitent is copied from the nymph in Titian’s _Education\r\nof Cupid_ at the Borghese Gallery, of which there is a drawing in the\r\nChatsworth Sketch-book with the comment in the artist’s handwriting,\r\n“_quel admirabil petto_.” Shortly after his return from Italy he\r\nalso painted _The Virgin and Child with Donors_ (No. 1962), one of\r\nhis greatest masterpieces. The Madonna is of a youthful, pure type,\r\nvastly different from the buxom Flemish women so often depicted by his\r\nmaster in saintly characters. The painting of the Infant’s body is as\r\nadmirable as that of the kneeling Donors, and a spiritual connection is\r\nestablished by the action of the Child and the expression of the man\r\ntowards whom He is holding out His hand.\r\n\r\nThe companion groups _A Gentleman and a Child_ (No. 1973) and _A Lady\r\nand her Daughter_ (No. 1974), date from about 1630. They are full of\r\nthat aristocratic distinction which is the hall-mark of Van Dyck’s\r\nGenoese portraits, and which in his later English period was apt to\r\ndegenerate into effeminacy. This air of distinction is also to be\r\nnoted in the children, although they are perfectly natural in action\r\nand expression, and have none of that stiffness which makes so many of\r\nthe earlier masters’ portraits of children look like undergrown men\r\nand women. The imposing equestrian portrait of _Francisco d’Aytona,\r\nMarqués de Moncada_ (No. 1971), Generalissimus of the Spanish troops\r\nin the Netherlands, which in its general disposition recalls the\r\nportrait of Charles I. at Windsor Castle; the small study for it of the\r\nsame sitter’s head and shoulders (No. 1972); and the portrait of _The\r\nInfanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, Regent of the Netherlands_ (No. 1970),\r\nin the costume of the Sisters of St. Clare, whom she had joined after\r\nthe death of her husband the Archduke Albrecht, belong to the same\r\nperiod. Then also was painted the _Rinaldo in the Garden of Armida_\r\n(No. 1966), which is probably the picture bought from the artist at\r\nAntwerp by Endymion Porter, on behalf of King Charles I., in March\r\n1629, for the price of £78.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         “LE ROI À LA CHASSE”\r\n\r\nVan Dyck’s manner of life in England, as the petted Court painter of\r\nCharles I., and the factory-like output of his well-organised studio at\r\nBlackfriars, are too well known to need further comment. In justice to\r\nhis fair fame it is necessary to draw a clear distinction between the\r\ninnumerable replicas turned out by his assistants under his guidance,\r\nand such magnificent original works from the master’s own brush as the\r\nglorious _Portrait of King Charles I. of England_ (No. 1967, Plate\r\nXXIII.), known as “_Le Roi à la Chasse_,” which is one of the proudest\r\npossessions of the French national collection. The king is seen,\r\nresting his gloved hand on a stick, in a glade, with the sea in the\r\ndistance. Behind him are two attendants and his white charger pawing\r\nthe ground in impatient action. The king’s noble, quiet dignity is such\r\nas to dominate the entire composition, without, however, the slightest\r\nhint of the theatrical. Here, as in most of his English portraits,\r\nVan Dyck has departed from the glowing sumptuousness of his earlier\r\nVenetian palette, and arrived at a cooler, mellow, and more personal\r\nharmony of decorative colour. As if conscious of the superior merit of\r\nthis picture, which is more than a mere portrait of the king, and\r\ndepicts the very personification of royalty, the artist, who was not in\r\nthe habit of signing his pictures, inscribed on a stone the lettering\r\n\r\n             CAROLUS I REX MAGNÆ BRITANNIÆ · VAN DIICK F.\r\n\r\nPainted for the king in 1635 for £100, it passed through many hands\r\nbefore it was bought by Louis XV. for Mme du Barry, by whom it was\r\nceded in 1775 to his successor for 24,000 _livres_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                   PLATE XXIII.—SIR ANTHONY VAN DYCK\r\n\r\n                              (1599-1641)\r\n\r\n                            FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n           No. 1967.—PORTRAIT OF KING CHARLES I.

The Marquess of Hamilton, in attendance\r\n  on the King, grasps the bridle of the charger; in the landscape\r\n  background is a page.\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on canvas.\r\n\r\n  Signed on a stone in the right foreground:—\r\n\r\n                    “CAROLUS I REX MAGNÆ BRITANNIÆ.\r\n                             VAN DIICK F.”\r\n\r\n  8 ft. 11½ in × 7 ft. (2·72 × 2·12.)]\r\n\r\nTo Van Dyck’s English period, which only terminated with his death in\r\n1641, belong the group of _Charles Louis, Elector Palatine, and Rupert,\r\nPrince of Bavaria_ (No. 1969), and the _Portrait of James Stuart, Duke\r\nof Lennox_ (No. 1975)—not the _Duke of Richmond_, as stated in the\r\nofficial Catalogue—in the character of Paris. Another twelve pictures\r\nare catalogued under Van Dyck’s name, but they are either of minor\r\nimportance, or, like the _Three Children of Charles I._ (No. 1968),\r\nmere studio repetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FRANS SNYDERS\r\n\r\nThe powerful personality of Rubens dominated the art of Flanders\r\nduring the seventeenth century. His direct or indirect influence is\r\ntraceable in the art of most of his contemporaries and of the painters\r\nof the next generation, who divided his artistic heritage without\r\nattaining to his universality. Thus his collaborator Frans Snyders\r\n(1579-1657), after studying under “Hell Brueghel” and H. van Balen,\r\nacquired the bravura of his brushwork and his unrivalled skill in\r\ndepicting animals in violent movement from Rubens, in whose pictures\r\nof the chase he frequently painted the animals, whilst he often had to\r\nseek the assistance of other painters for the figures introduced into\r\nhis own compositions. Among the thirteen pictures from his brush at\r\nthe Louvre (Nos. 2141-2153) the _Wild Boar Hunt_ (No. 2144) serves\r\nbest to illustrate Snyders’s power to suggest the furious onrush and\r\nwild excitement of the chase. His skill as a still-life painter may be\r\njudged from the masterly treatment of the wet glittering fish in the\r\nlarge _Fish Merchants_ (No. 2145).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JACOB JORDAENS\r\n\r\nWhatever appears coarse in the art of Rubens is accentuated to the\r\npoint of grossness in the paintings by his fellow-student under Van\r\nNoort, Jacob Jordaens (1593-1678). He is the painter of _Le Roi boit_\r\n(No. 2014) or _The Twelfth Night Feast_, which is by no means the best\r\nof his many versions of his favourite subject. He was a realist who, as\r\nmay be seen from this picture and from the _Concert after a Meal_ (No.\r\n2015), found his most congenial subjects in the carousals of Flemish\r\nmerrymakers, which he depicted with more than a touch of coarse humour.\r\nThat his temperament and limitations debarred him from achieving\r\nsuccess in the higher flights of art is clearly shown by his large but\r\nby no means noble canvas _Christ driving the Moneylenders from the\r\nTemple_ (No. 2011). On the other hand, his firm grasp of character\r\nstood him in good stead in portraiture. The so-called _Portrait of\r\nAdmiral de Ruyter_ (No. 2016), which was bought in 1824 for £800, is a\r\ngood example.\r\n\r\nWe can only briefly refer to a number of seventeenth-century Antwerp\r\npainters, who were either pupils of Rubens or close followers of his\r\ntradition. Gonzales Coques (1614-1684), the painter of the admirably\r\nlighted _Family Party_ (No. 1952), was essentially a portrait painter\r\nwho became known as “the little Van Dyck,” although his manner had more\r\nin common with that of the Dutch “small masters” than with the tempered\r\nelegance of Charles I.’s Court-painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FOLLOWERS OF RUBENS\r\n\r\nGaspar de Crayer (1584-1669), a pupil of Raphael van Coxie, modelled\r\nhis art entirely on Rubens, and was equally successful as a portrait\r\npainter and in his religious compositions. Both phases of his art\r\nfigure in the Louvre collection, which owns the _St. Augustin in\r\nEcstasy_ (No. 1953) and the life-size _Equestrian Portrait of the\r\nInfante Ferdinand, Governor of the Netherlands_ (No. 1954). It was a\r\nportrait of the same sitter that led to Crayer’s appointment to the\r\nposition of Painter to the Infante’s Court, accompanied by considerable\r\nemoluments.\r\n\r\nAbraham van Diepenbeeck (1596-1675), Pieter van Mol (1599-1650), and\r\nPaul de Vos (1593-1676) need not here detain us. They are all capable\r\nfollowers of their master’s style, without any personal distinction.\r\nDavid Ryckaert (1612-1661), the third of four artists of the same\r\nfamily that bore this name, is outside the immediate circle of Rubens.\r\nHis _Interior of a Studio_ (No. 2137), which bears the signature “D.\r\nRYC. f. 1638,” is of peculiar interest as a document illustrating the\r\n_milieu_ in which a Flemish artist of that period lived and worked.\r\n\r\nGerard Seghers (1591-1651), the painter of _St. Francis in Ecstasy_\r\n(No. 2140), although a pupil of Van Balen and Abraham Janssens, and\r\nindirectly, through Manfredi, of Caravaggio, must be counted among\r\nthose who were influenced by the dominating personality of Rubens. An\r\nimportant pupil of Snyders was Jan Fyt (1611-1661), who excelled as\r\nan animal painter and colourist. He was at his best when he treated\r\nanimals more in the manner of still life, but remained vastly inferior\r\nto his master when he tried to emulate his hunting scenes. Not all the\r\nfive pictures catalogued under his name can be accepted as his own\r\nwork. His great skill in rendering the varied textures of furs and\r\nfeathers may be judged from _Game in a Larder_ (No. 1993), which is\r\nunquestionably authentic although it does not bear the signature which\r\ntestifies to his authorship of _A Dog devouring Game_ (No. 1994).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ADRIAEN BROUWER\r\n\r\nBoth the Flemish school and the Dutch have an equal right to claim\r\nAdriaen Brouwer (1605 or 6-1638), who, born at Oudenarde, carried on\r\nthe tradition of Bouts and the elder Brueghel. While still young, he\r\nwas at Haarlem powerfully impressed by the art of Frans Hals, although\r\nit is extremely doubtful that he ever actually worked in his studio.\r\nFinally, having settled at Antwerp in 1631, he benefited by the example\r\nof Rubens. _The Smoker_ (No. 1916), in spite of the doubts that have\r\nbeen cast upon it, is a characteristic work of his at the time when,\r\ninspired by Frans Hals, he adopted a full impasto instead of his\r\nearlier glazes. It is signed with his initials “AB” in the bottom\r\ncorner on the right. The handling is far coarser than that of the later\r\n_Interior of a Tavern_ (No. 1912), which is quite Rembrandtesque in the\r\nrendering of light and chiaroscuro. His inclination towards grimacing\r\nexpression often made him depict such scenes as _The Operation_ (No.\r\n1915), in which the patient’s face is contorted with pain, while the\r\nsurgeon is bandaging his left shoulder.\r\n\r\nBrouwer was the master of Joos van Craesbeeck (1606-1654?), who not\r\nonly closely followed his teaching, but actually painted many replicas\r\nof Brouwer’s pictures which still pass under the better known artist’s\r\nname. _The Artist painting a Portrait_ (No. 1952D) was supposed to\r\nrepresent, and to be from the brush of, Brouwer, when the picture\r\nwas bought for the Louvre. But on technical grounds it must be given\r\nto Craesbeeck—quite apart from the extreme improbability that the\r\ndissolute Brouwer, who spent most of his time in low taverns, should\r\nhave lived in the elegant, not to say luxurious, surroundings here\r\ndepicted, and died young. There can be no doubt that the painter\r\nseated before his easel, to whom a man-servant is offering a glass of\r\nwine, is Joos van Craesbeeck.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DAVID TENIERS\r\n\r\nThere is at the Louvre no picture by the elder David Teniers\r\n(1582-1649), who therefore only interests us here as the father and\r\nfirst master of the much greater artist David Teniers the Younger\r\n(1610-1690), who completed his artistic education under Rubens,\r\nwithout, however, abdicating his own personality. Indeed, those of\r\nhis pictures which reflect the manner of Rubens too closely are of\r\nlittle account in the achievement of the younger Teniers, who only\r\nbegins to be himself when he devotes his prolific brush to the social\r\nlife of his contemporaries, and especially of the lower classes. His\r\npictures constitute the most realistic and convincing record of the\r\ntastes, manners, and amusements of his time. His types are full of\r\ncharacter, but without the exaggerations so often found in Brueghel and\r\nBrouwer. What he retained of Rubens, even in his Village Fêtes, Tavern\r\nScenes, Dances, and Carousals is the application of the great master’s\r\nprinciples of light and harmonious colour. But apart from this, he\r\nrejected the “grand style” and the conscious search for beauty. The\r\nugliness of his types and gestures led Louis XIV. to exclaim in front\r\nof his pictures, “_Ôtez-moi ces magots-là!_”\r\n\r\nFew painters are as exhaustively represented at the Louvre as the\r\nyounger Teniers. The Catalogue includes no fewer than thirty-nine\r\nentries under his name, two of which, in the La Caze collection\r\n(Nos. 2189 and 2190), are copies after pictures by Lotto and Titian\r\nrespectively in the collection of the Archduke Leopold William,\r\nGovernor of the Netherlands, to whom Teniers was appointed Court\r\npainter. It would serve no purpose here to enumerate the long list\r\nof Kermesse, Village Fête, and Alehouse Scenes in the French national\r\ncollection. Among his most deservedly famous masterpieces is _The\r\nReturn of the Prodigal Son_ (No. 2156), which belongs to a series of\r\nwhich another scene is to be seen at the Dulwich Gallery. The subject\r\nis really only a thinly veiled excuse for the painting of a _genre_\r\npiece of the contemporary life of the better classes of his country.\r\nThe scene of the feast is laid outside a country inn that figures in\r\nmany of Teniers’s pictures. Fully signed, and dated 1644, the picture\r\nbelongs to the beginning of Teniers’s very best period. In _The\r\nTemptation of St. Anthony_ (No. 2158) he rivals Bosch in the invention\r\nof grotesquely fantastic monsters. Among other important works by the\r\nmaster in the Louvre must be mentioned _The Denial of St. Peter_ (No.\r\n2155), a painting of exquisite silvery quality, signed and dated\r\n\r\n                      DAVID TENIERS, f. AN. 1646;\r\n\r\n_The Works of Mercy_ (No. 2157); the _Village Fête_ (No. 2159); and the\r\n_Peasants dancing by an Inn Door_ (No. 2161), which was stolen from the\r\ncollection in 1815 and returned in the following year with a letter\r\nexplaining that it had been removed by a Frenchman who feared that it\r\nmight fall into the hands of the Allied Forces.\r\n\r\nBy Teniers’s pupil, François Duchatel (1616?-1694?) is the excellent\r\n_Portrait of a Gentleman_ (No. 1960). Duchatel is a very rare master,\r\nwhose style in portraiture so closely resembles that of Gonzales Coques\r\nthat his pictures have been at times ascribed to that painter. Jacob\r\nvan Artois (1613-1684?), the painter of the _Landscape_ (No. 1901) in\r\nthe La Caze room, was one of the leading Flemish landscape painters\r\nof his time, and frequently collaborated with Teniers, who added the\r\nfigures to some of his landscapes. He was the master of Cornelis\r\nHuysmans (1648-1727), who frequently assisted the battle painter,\r\nVan der Meulen, and is here represented by eight pictures (Nos.\r\n2002-2009). Among the landscape painters of that period must also be\r\nmentioned Jan Siberechts (1627-1703), who spent the closing years of\r\nhis life in England, but does not seem to have had much influence on\r\nthe evolution of the English landscape school. By him is the _Rustic\r\nScene_ (No. 2140A).\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PHILIPPE DE CHAMPAIGNE\r\n\r\nBoth Philippe de Champaigne (1602-1674) and Adam Frans van der Meulen\r\n(1634-1690), though born at Brussels, resided in France the best part\r\nof their life, and are therefore generally classed with the painters of\r\nthe French school, which accounts for their being represented at the\r\nLouvre in a manner which is quite out of proportion to their artistic\r\nsignificance. Still, if Philippe de Champaigne appears second-rate when\r\ncompared with Rubens and Van Dyck, he is unquestionably the leading\r\nportrait painter of the contemporary French school in which he received\r\nhis training. His powers were insufficient for the higher flights of\r\nimagination, and when his ambition led him to such compositions as\r\n_Christ in the House of Simon_ (No. 1927) or _Christ celebrating Easter\r\nwith His Disciples_ (No. 1928), he was as dull and bombastic as most\r\nof his French contemporaries, whom he far excelled as a colourist.\r\nHis portraits, on the other hand, are painted in a broad, honest,\r\nstraightforward manner which has nothing in common with the monotonous\r\npompousness of his age, as may be seen from the admirable group of two\r\nnuns in prayer, _Mother Catherine Agnes Arnaud and Sister Catherine de\r\nSainte-Suzanne_ (No. 1934). The younger of the two nuns represents the\r\nartist’s daughter, who was healed from paralysis by a miracle recorded\r\nby a Latin inscription on the wall. The twenty pictures from Philippe\r\nde Champaigne’s brush, which are actually on view, also include\r\nthe fine group of the two architects _François Mansard and Claude\r\nPerrault_ (No. 1944), bought in 1835 for the low price of £80; _The\r\nProvost and Aldermen of Paris_ (No. 1945); and the signed and dated\r\nportrait of _Robert Arnaud d’Andilly_ (No. 1939).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VAN DER MEULEN\r\n\r\nVan der Meulen, a native of Brussels and pupil of Snayers, was the\r\nhistoriographer of Louis XIV.’s campaigns and victories. He was invited\r\nby Colbert to come to Paris, and was first employed to furnish designs\r\nfor the Gobelins manufactory. Afterwards he accompanied Louis XIV.\r\non his warlike expeditions, which he immortalised in numerous large\r\npaintings, most of which are now at the Louvre and in the Château at\r\nVersailles. His paintings are of considerable topographical interest,\r\nas they give accurate representations of the aspect of famous towns\r\nand fortresses in the seventeenth century, as in the _Entry of Louis\r\nXIV. and Marie-Thérèse into Arras_ (No. 2035), a similar scene at\r\n_Douai_ (No. 2033), and the _Arrival of the King in the Camp before\r\nMaastricht_ (No. 2040). It was Van der Meulen who founded the “tactical\r\nschool” of battle painting, which substituted the orderly movement of\r\nmasses for the wild mêlée of the hand-to-hand combat. Whole armies are\r\nseen advancing or retreating in long lines from a high vantage-ground\r\nwhich is generally occupied by the considerably larger figures of the\r\narmy-leaders on rearing and caracoling horses, and looking for all the\r\nworld like “_gens de qualité qui joueraient aux échecs avec des soldats\r\nde plomb_.” The official Catalogue mentions no fewer than twenty\r\npictures by Van der Meulen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MINOR FLEMISH PAINTERS\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Justus Sustermans (1597-1681), who was Van Dyck’s\r\nfellow-student under H. van Balen and afterwards rose to great fame\r\nas Court painter to Grand-Duke Cosimo II. of Tuscany (whose kinsman\r\n_Leopold de’ Medici_ is portrayed in No. 2154), and Pieter Neefs\r\n(1577?-1661?), whose _Church Interiors_ (Nos. 2059-2064) are remarkable\r\nfor the faultless accuracy and precision of his architectural drawing,\r\nthere are no other painters of the Flemish school whose works at the\r\nLouvre require close attention. We must content ourselves with the\r\nmere mention of the landscape painters Jan Frans van Bloemen, called\r\nOrizonte, a follower of Poussin and Claude; Jan van Breda, Francisque\r\nMillet, and Mathys Schoevaerts; Carl van Falens and Anton Grief,\r\npainters of hunting scenes; Jan Miel, who worked most of his life in\r\nItaly and was completely influenced by the masters of that country;\r\nthe still-life painter Gaspard Pieter Verbruggen; the battle painter\r\nSebastiaen Francken; and the prolific painter of large altarpieces,\r\nJacob van Oost the Elder. With Balthasar Paul Ommeganck (1755-1826)\r\nand the still-life painter Jan Frans van Dael (1764-1840) we reach the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, a period of absolute stagnation in\r\nFlemish art which preceded the brilliant revival of the modern Belgian\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE GERMAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the important European schools of painting, the Early German\r\nschool is the one of which it is almost impossible to gain anything\r\nlike an adequate idea from the pictures that have found their way into\r\nthe Galleries of foreign countries. The fact is that with the exception\r\nof two or three leading masters, like Holbein and Dürer, the Early\r\nGermans found but scant favour beyond the confines of their own country\r\nuntil comparatively recent years—that is to say, until the majority\r\nof important examples had been systematically gathered in by the\r\nmuseums of Germany. Now that the importance of the German primitives\r\nand Early Renaissance painters has been generally recognised, it\r\nwill be practically impossible to regain the lost ground and to fill\r\nup the serious gaps which prevent our forming an adequate idea of\r\nthe evolution of German art in the museums of other countries. The\r\nLouvre is no exception to this rule. The numerical weakness of the\r\nGerman section is unfortunately not atoned for by the importance of\r\nthe examples included, which, with but few exceptions, are of little\r\nartistic account.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances it would be useless to attempt a consecutive\r\nnarrative of the evolution of German art as illustrated by the pictures\r\nat the Louvre, and we must confine ourselves to a brief discussion of\r\nthe few noteworthy works in the collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 “THE MASTER OF THE BARTHOLOMEW ALTAR”\r\n\r\nThe first picture of importance belongs to the period when the idealism\r\nof the Early Gothic primitives was already replaced by a strong\r\nnaturalism, and the creation of types by that of clearly characterised\r\nindividualities. This picture, the _Descent from the Cross_ (No. 2737),\r\nby the unknown “Master of the Bartholomew Altar,” is so called, in\r\naccordance with German custom, from his best known work, the great\r\naltarpiece in the Pinakothek at Munich. In the large Louvre picture,\r\nwhich bears a close resemblance to the precious little panel by the\r\nsame master in the possession of the Hon. Edward Wood, at Temple\r\nNewsam, the Saviour is being lowered from the Cross by Nicodemus into\r\nthe hands of one of the Holy Women on the left, and of Joseph of\r\nArimathæa on the right. The group is completed by St. John supporting\r\nthe Virgin on the extreme left, the Magdalen and another Holy Woman on\r\nthe right, and a Disciple seated on a ladder above the central group.\r\nThe figures are shown, as in the Temple Newsam painting of the same\r\nsubject, against a gold background framed with rich Gothic tracery.\r\nThis altarpiece is believed to be the last picture by this Cologne\r\nmaster, who flourished between 1490 and 1515, and was in his later\r\nmanner influenced by Rogier van der Weyden and other Flemish masters.\r\nThis eminently important Early German picture was painted for a Jesuit\r\nestablishment in the rue St. Antoine, Paris, which accounts for its\r\npresence in the French national collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           COLOGNE PAINTERS\r\n\r\nThe “Master of the Death of Mary,” to whose school belongs the _Descent\r\nfrom the Cross_, with a predella representing _The Last Supper_, and a\r\nlunette with _St. Francis receiving the Stigmata_ (No. 2738), has been\r\nidentified by Wauters and Aldenhoven with the early-sixteenth-century\r\nFlemish painter Joos van Cleef the Elder, and belongs to the Antwerp\r\nrather than the Cologne school. The “Master of St. Severin,” to whom\r\nthe official Catalogue ascribes the two _Scenes from the Life of St.\r\nUrsula_ (Nos. 2738C and 2738D), was probably a Flemish painter who\r\nworked at Cologne at the beginning of the sixteenth century. But the\r\ntwo panels at the Louvre, which were formerly at the Cluny Museum, are\r\nnot from his brush. They are the work of his pupil, the “Master of the\r\nUrsula Legend,” and belong to a series of which other panels can be\r\nseen at the Victoria and Albert Museum and at Cologne.\r\n\r\nThe first definite name in the annals of the Cologne school is\r\nthat of Bartolomäus Bruyn (_c._ 1493-1555), who was a follower of\r\nJoos van Cleef but subsequently became completely imbued with the\r\nItalian spirit. His portraits, in which he remained more faithful to\r\nthe tradition of his country, are of greater significance than his\r\nreligious compositions, and closely resemble those by Joos van Cleef;\r\nbut the _Portrait of a Man with a White Cross on his Breast_ (No. 2702)\r\nis only a school picture of indifferent quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ALBRECHT DÜRER\r\n\r\nThe flourishing school which had its centre at Nuremberg is represented\r\nat the Louvre by the master who marks its zenith and who, if his\r\ncraftsmanship was not always on a level with the perfection of\r\nHolbein’s, shares with the Augsburg master the honour of uncontested\r\nleadership of all German artists. Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) was born\r\nat Nuremberg, of Hungarian descent. He studied his art under Michael\r\nWohlgemut, a very able Nuremberg painter, who was, however, led by his\r\npopularity to factory-like production of pictures that passed under his\r\nname, although they were largely executed by inferior pupils. Dürer,\r\nwho excelled equally as an engraver and as a painter, was, on the\r\nother hand, one of the most sincere and personal artists of his time—a\r\nprofound thinker, a shrewd observer, a student of life in all its\r\nphases, an idealist who was ever striving for beautiful expression,\r\neven though the realistic tradition of his country did not allow him to\r\nattain to the abstract ideal of beauty which had been reached by some\r\nof the contemporary Italians. Indeed, Dürer may with justice be called\r\nthe Leonardo of the North. He studied Venetian art on a visit to Venice\r\nin 1505, whither he had been preceded by his fame. He also travelled to\r\nthe Netherlands in 1520, the year in which he painted the signed and\r\ndated _Head of an Old Man_ (No. 2709), his other picture at the Louvre\r\nbeing the not very masterly _Head of a Child_ (No. 2709A).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DÜRER’S FOLLOWERS\r\n\r\nDürer died in 1528 from a disease contracted during his journey to\r\nthe Netherlands. Among his principal pupils were Georg Pencz (_c._\r\n1500-1550), to whom is without sufficient reason attributed the\r\nindifferent half figure of _St. John the Evangelist_ (No. 2730); and\r\nHans Sebald Beham (_c._ 1500-1550), the famous engraver, of whom the\r\nLouvre is fortunate to possess the only known painting, a table top\r\ndivided by golden lances into four compartments, each of which contains\r\na _Subject from the Story of David_ (No. 2701): the _Entry of Saul\r\ninto Jerusalem; David and Bathsheba_ (in which scene is introduced\r\na portrait of Archbishop Albrecht of Mayence, for whom the work was\r\nexecuted); the _Siege of Rabbath_; and the _Prophet Nathan before\r\nDavid_ (with a portrait of the artist and the initials of his name, “H.\r\nS. B.”).\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LUCAS CRANACH\r\n\r\nThis same Archbishop Albrecht, whose features are also known to us\r\nfrom two engravings by Dürer and a painting by Grünewald, was one of\r\nthe most generous patrons of Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472-1553),\r\nwhose busy workshops at Wittenberg supplied the whole north and east\r\nof Germany with portraits, altarpieces, historical and mythological\r\npictures. Lucas Cranach was a follower of Grünewald, the great head of\r\nthe Colmar school. Apart from his merit as a colourist and an excellent\r\ndraughtsman, he attracts by the naïve grace of his nude figures and\r\nby the complete manner in which he reflects the taste of his time and\r\ncountry. But of the five little pictures that figure in the Louvre\r\nCatalogue under his name, not one is from his own hand. Indeed, the\r\n_Venus in a Landscape_ (No. 2703) is the only one that may with a\r\ndegree of safety be attributed to his son, Lucas Cranach the Younger,\r\nwho carried on the management of the studio some years before his\r\nfather’s death, and continued to imitate his style until his own death\r\nin 1586. The _Venus_ bears the usual Cranach signature of a winged\r\nserpent and the date 1520. The same crest, with the date 1532, figures\r\non the portrait of _Johann Friedrich III., Elector of Saxony_ (No.\r\n2704), who is known on one occasion to have given a wholesale order of\r\nsixty replicas of the same portrait to the Wittenberg master. It may be\r\nimagined that a commission of this nature would not be executed by the\r\nhead of the studio, but left to his staff of assistants. The _Fighting\r\nSavages_ (No. 2702A) and the two _Portraits_ (Nos. 2703A and 2705) are,\r\nat the best, studio works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HANS HOLBEIN\r\n\r\nWe now come to the second of the two commanding figures in German\r\nart, Hans Holbein the Younger (1497-1543), who was born at Augsburg\r\nand studied under his father, the elder artist of the same name. When\r\nhe reached his maturity the Italian influence had already permeated\r\nGerman art, but he was the first Northern master who knew how to\r\nbenefit by the real spirit of the Renaissance without imitating the\r\nletter; the first to develop a noble, dignified style, free from the\r\nflorid trivialities which so many Northerners took from certain Italian\r\npainters. He was above all a marvellous portrait painter who, in his\r\ndrawings as well as in his paintings, combines the most exquisite\r\ndelicacy and subtlety with rare strength, the greatest precision of\r\ndetail with freedom and breadth of handling. Only this phase of his art\r\nis represented at the Louvre, which certainly owns one perfect example\r\nof Holbein’s portraiture in the _Portrait of Erasmus_ (No. 2715, Plate\r\nXXIV.).\r\n\r\nHolbein had settled in Basle in 1519. He went to England in 1526, with\r\na letter of introduction from Erasmus to Sir Thomas More. From one\r\nof Erasmus’s letters it would appear that Holbein had portrayed him\r\nat least three times before 1524; and the picture now in the Louvre\r\nwas probably the one that was painted for Sir Thomas More—a better\r\nrecommendation than any letter of introduction! The profile is drawn\r\nwith inimitable mastery; and the whole character of the man can be read\r\nfrom the expression of the tight-pressed lips and mobile features, as\r\nhe sits writing at his desk. Note, also, the marvellous expressiveness\r\nof the hands, studies for which are to be found in the collection of\r\ndrawings at the Louvre.\r\n\r\nIn view of the personal relations which link together Holbein, Erasmus,\r\nand Sir Thomas More, it would be pleasant if we could accept the\r\nso-called _Portrait of Thomas More, Great Chancellor of England_ (No.\r\n2717), as authentic. It does not, however, represent Holbein’s first\r\nEnglish patron, nor does it appear to be from the master’s own brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE KRATZER PORTRAIT\r\n\r\nHolbein’s first sojourn in England extended from 1526 to 1528, in which\r\nyear he returned to Basle. It must have been shortly before his\r\ndeparture that he painted the _Portrait of Nicolas Kratzer, Astronomer\r\nto King Henry VIII._ (No. 2713); it is an unquestionably authentic\r\nwork, although it has been so extensively repainted that little is now\r\nleft of the original, save the general disposition of the design and\r\nthe instruments placed on the table and hung on the wall, which are\r\nexecuted with all the loving care that Holbein was wont to bestow upon\r\nsuch accessories. Still, even in its present condition, the portrait\r\nis a thoroughly convincing likeness of “a man who is brimful of wit,\r\njest, and humorous fancies”—as Kratzer is referred to by one of his\r\ncontemporaries. A sheet of paper on the left of the table appears to be\r\ninscribed:—\r\n\r\n  _Imago ad vivam effigiem expressa\r\n  Nicolai Kratzeri monacensis qui bavarus erat\r\n  Quadragessimum annum tempore illo complebat.\r\n                    1528._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                 PLATE XXIV.—HANS HOLBEIN THE YOUNGER\r\n\r\n                              (1497-1543)\r\n\r\n                             GERMAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                     No. 2715.—PORTRAIT OF ERASMUS\r\n\r\n                      (Portrait de Didier Érasme)\r\n\r\n  The Humanist is seen at half length and in forefile to the left,\r\n  before a table at which he is writing.

(0·42 × 0·32.)]\r\n\r\nAlthough decidedly superior to another version of the same picture\r\nat Lambeth Palace, the _Portrait of William Warham, Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury_ (No. 2714), which bears the inscription,\r\n\r\n                 ANNO. Dm. MDXXVII. ETATIS. SVE, LXX.,\r\n\r\ncannot without hesitation be accepted as an original work. It lacks,\r\nat any rate, the _finesse_ of the beautiful drawing at Windsor Castle,\r\nupon which it is evidently based.\r\n\r\nTo the same year belongs the _Portrait of Sir Richard Southwell_ (No.\r\n2719), to whose treacherous accusation was due the execution of Henry\r\nHoward, Earl of Surrey. But this picture, again, is only a replica, by\r\nan inferior hand, of the magnificent portrait in the Uffizi Gallery\r\n(No. 765). An inscription in the background, at both sides of the head,\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n  on the left: X.^O IVLII. ANNO.     and on the right: ETATIS SVÆ\r\n               H. VIII. XXVIII.                        ANNO XXXIII.\r\n\r\nIt would thus appear that the picture was painted in 1537, the\r\ntwenty-eighth year of Henry VIII.’s reign. The _Portrait of a Man\r\nholding a Carnation and a Rosary_ (No. 2720) is a picture of poor\r\nquality and has no connection whatever with Holbein.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PORTRAIT OF ANNE OF CLEVES\r\n\r\nOf far greater importance and undisputed authenticity is the _Portrait\r\nof Anne of Cleves, Fourth Wife of Henry VIII._ (No. 2718). No\r\ncredence is to be attached to the legend invented by Bishop Burnet\r\nmore than a century after that ill-treated lady’s death, according to\r\nwhich Holbein’s flattering portrait was instrumental in “bluff King\r\nHal’s” choice of his fourth spouse and responsible for the king’s\r\ndisappointment at setting eyes upon Anne. The picture, which was\r\npainted in 1539, seven years after Holbein’s definite return to England\r\nand to the service of Henry VIII., has not only that air of inevitable\r\ntruthfulness which distinguishes all Holbein’s portraiture, but tallies\r\nto a remarkable degree with the descriptions sent to Henry VIII. by his\r\nagents. Whilst not exactly unpleasant to behold, the features are those\r\nof a spiritless, dull woman—an impression which is intensified by the\r\nabsence of life and character in the hands, which Holbein invariably\r\nstudied as closely as the face. The painting of the richly embroidered\r\nand jewelled costume, the stately symmetry of the design, and the\r\nbeautiful scheme of colour are really the chief attractions of this\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThe _Adoration of the Magi_ (No. 2711A), which was at one time\r\nattributed to the elder, and subsequently to the younger, Holbein, is\r\nnow rightly given to the latter’s contemporary and compatriot Gumpold\r\nGiltlinger, an Augsburg painter of no particular distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the sixteenth century German art had entered upon a\r\nperiod of complete decadence. The only painter who claims attention,\r\nnot so much for the undeniable merit of his very highly finished\r\nlandscapes, but for the fact that he exercised a certain influence upon\r\nRembrandt, is the Frankfort painter, Adam Elsheimer (1578-1621?), who\r\nworked at Rome, and who is represented at the Louvre by _The Flight\r\ninto Egypt_ (No. 2710) and _The Good Samaritan_ (No. 2711).\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the German painters of his period and of the whole of the\r\nseventeenth century retained scarcely a trace of national character,\r\nand were completely under the sway of the foreign, and particularly\r\nof the Italian, schools. Thus, Johann Rottenhammer (1564-1623), the\r\npainter of _The Death of Adonis_ (No. 2732) and _Diana and Calisto_\r\n(No. 2733), was successively dominated by Jan Brueghel and by\r\nTintoretto. The flower painter, Abraham Mignon (1640-1679), though born\r\nat Frankfort, was a pupil of David de Heem and a Dutchman in his art.\r\nHis pictures at the Louvre (Nos. 2724-2729) are distributed between\r\nthe German and the Dutch sections. Philipp Peter Roos, better known as\r\nRosa da Tivoli (1665?-1705), who painted the _Wolf devouring a Sheep_\r\n(No. 2731), lived in Rome and adopted the style of the country of his\r\ndomicile. _The Bear Hunt_ (No. 2734) is the work of Carl Ruthart,\r\nanother unimportant Italianising German of the second half of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nThe work of the Hamburg painter, Baltasar Denner (1685-1749), has no\r\nclaim to be considered as a manifestation of art: it is merely a\r\ndisplay of mechanical skill in the microscopic rendering of the little\r\nlines and pores and stubbly hair on the skin of old people’s faces. He\r\nlived for seven years in London, where he painted in 1724 the signed\r\n_Portrait of an Old Woman_ (No. 2706), which was bought in 1852 for\r\n£756. Another characteristic example of his misapplied skill is the\r\nportrait (No. 2707) in the La Caze Room.\r\n\r\nChristian Wilhelm Dietrich (1712-1774) and Heinrich Wilhelm\r\nSchweickhardt (1746-1787) are too insignificant to deserve serious\r\nconsideration. The same remark applies to Christian Seybold\r\n(1703?-1768), who became Court Painter to the Empress Maria Theresa;\r\nand to Johann Ernest Heinsius, who was active as a portrait painter in\r\nFrance during the reign of Louis XVI. All that is to be noted in their\r\npictures at the Louvre is the total absence of all artistic merit.\r\n\r\nOf somewhat greater importance, though by no means of the first rank,\r\nare the two last German artists who claim our attention: Raphael Mengs\r\n(1728-1779) and Angelica Kaufmann, (1741-1807), who is catalogued\r\namong the painters of the German school, although she was Swiss by\r\nbirth, Italian by education, and English by domicile. Her sex was no\r\nbar to her becoming one of the Foundation members of the English Royal\r\nAcademy, and she is generally counted among the English painters. The\r\nportrait group of _The Baroness von Krüdner and her Daughter_ (No.\r\n2722) is a poor example of her art, which invariably sought to please\r\nby conventional prettiness.\r\n\r\nRaphael Mengs, the painter of the portrait of _Marie Amelia Christina\r\nof Saxony, Wife of Charles III. of Spain_, was born at Aussig in\r\nBohemia, studied whilst still a boy in Italy, and became Court Painter\r\nto Charles III., who invited him to Madrid in 1761. Mengs was an\r\nexceedingly accomplished technician and draughtsman, who modelled\r\nhimself on Raphael and the Italian eclectics, but was wholly lacking\r\nin originality and inspiration. He tried his hand in every branch\r\nof his art, and was most successful in portraiture, although even\r\nhis portraits are lacking in penetration of character. He, however,\r\nexcelled as a copyist, and died in Rome in 1779.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SPANISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThough numerically by no means imposing, the Spanish pictures at the\r\nLouvre form an exceedingly interesting section of the great French\r\nnational collection, comprising, as they do, characteristic examples of\r\nthe art of practically all the most prominent figures in the evolution\r\nof Spanish painting. Compared with the schools of Italy and Flanders,\r\nthat of Spain was tardy in its development and very much dependent\r\nupon foreign influences. The activity of Flemish and Italian masters\r\nin Spain—we need only mention Starnina, Dello Delli, Rubens, Luca\r\nGiordano—and the visits of several eminent Spanish masters to Italy,\r\ncould not fail to leave their clear mark on the art of the Peninsula,\r\nthe renaissance of which was almost entirely due to the stimulus\r\nreceived from abroad. The short visit of Jan van Eyck to Portugal in\r\n1429 also had a profound influence on the art of the Peninsula. But\r\nthe local conditions, the strict rule of the Church and the tyranny of\r\nthe Inquisition, the stiff ceremonial of the Court,—the only rival of\r\nthe Church in the patronage of the arts,—and especially the sombre,\r\npassionate character of the Spanish race,—all helped to transform the\r\nimported styles into an art of definite national stamp, an art that\r\nis marked by sombreness, asceticism, dramatic intensity, and deep\r\nreligious feeling. Throughout it is dominated by realistic tendencies\r\nand rude strength rather than by the striving for grace and beauty and\r\nrhythm which characterise Italian art.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LUIS DE DALMAU\r\n\r\nThe Louvre is fortunate in possessing an authentic and extremely\r\nimportant, though badly restored, altarpiece by Ludovico Luis de\r\nDalmau, the first Spanish painter whose personality emerges definitely\r\nfrom the obscurity of the Gothic period in Spain. Dalmau was a Catalan\r\nwho flourished about the middle of the fifteenth century, and who,\r\nalthough not a direct pupil of the Van Eycks, shows such close affinity\r\nwith their style that certain modern critics are inclined to ascribe\r\nto him, with insufficient reason, certain pictures, like the _Fountain\r\nof Living Water_ at the Prado, by the heads and founders of the Bruges\r\nschool. In spite of the different types and the increased angularity\r\nof the drapery folds in Dalmau’s _Enthronement of St. Isidore_ (No.\r\n1703A), this Eyckian influence is clearly traceable in the Louvre\r\npicture, which shows the Virgin enthroned under a Gothic canopy wearing\r\na crown of typically Spanish form, and handing the pallium to the\r\nsaintly Bishop of Seville, who kneels on the left. Further back on the\r\nsame side are four angels with the episcopal insignia. The group is\r\nbalanced on the right by St. Anthony the Hermit in the foreground, and\r\nSS. Catherine, Margaret, Agatha, Odilia, and Apollonia grouped around\r\nthe throne. The picture was originally in a church at Valladolid, and\r\nwas bought for the Louvre at the Bourgeois sale at Cologne in 1904 for\r\n£3025.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LUIS MORALES\r\n\r\nWe need not here pay attention to the few unimportant pictures by\r\nunknown early Spanish masters in the collection, and may pass on to\r\nLuis Morales, called “El Divino” (“The Divine”) (1509-1586), who was\r\nborn at Badajoz, and worked at Toledo, when the whole Spanish school\r\nwas already addicted to the Italian mannerisms introduced by Berreguete\r\nand other native artists trained in Rome. Morales, however, remained\r\nfaithful to the tradition of his own country, and was essentially a\r\npainter of those religious subjects which enabled him to follow the\r\nnational bent for the sombre and tragic—the sufferings of Christ and\r\nof the Virgin, and similar themes. The _Christ carrying the Cross_ (No.\r\n1707) is a typical instance of the tragic intensity of his conception.\r\nAll the suffering of the Saviour is expressed in His drawn features\r\nand His heavy, swollen eyelids. The picture is not dated, but was\r\nevidently painted before 1564, in which year the master was called to\r\nthe Escorial and, while in the service of Philip II., to a great extent\r\nlost his individual style in the imitation of the Italians, that was\r\nprobably forced upon him by the taste of his patrons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EL GRECO\r\n\r\nWe now come to one of the most interesting figures in the history of\r\nSpanish painting—Dominico Theotocopuli, better known as “El Greco”\r\n(1548-1614), from the country of his birth. Born in Crete about 1548,\r\nEl Greco entered at a very early age the studio of Titian in Venice.\r\nThis at least we know from a letter written by Clovio from Rome in\r\n1570, without which, if we were to judge from the master’s early\r\nstyle, we should be forced to the conclusion that he acquired his art\r\nfrom Tintoretto, and more particularly from Jacopo da Ponte, to whom\r\nseveral of his earliest works in private collections were formerly,\r\nand in some cases are still, ascribed. He went to Rome in 1570, and\r\nafter five or six years took up his abode at Toledo, his first dated\r\npicture in that city, the scene of his chief activity, bearing the\r\ndate 1577. Between that year and his death in 1614, his extant works\r\nillustrate the gradual evolution of his art, the change of his Italian\r\ninto a typically Spanish manner, the rapid acquisition of a very\r\npersonal style, and the straining of that personal style to extreme\r\nmannerism. The notes and flashes of rare, cold, almost acid, but always\r\nharmonious, colour lend a peculiar distinction to El Greco’s work. His\r\npredilection for long, narrow faces and slender, emaciated bodies led\r\nhim in his declining years to extravagant exaggeration; the ecstatic\r\npassionate action and gesture of his figures reveal contortion and\r\nfrenzy. As a portrait painter El Greco is second only to Velazquez in\r\nthe school of his adopted country. His biographer, Señor Cossío, has\r\ncalled him “a painter of souls,” because he had that intense power of\r\npenetration which perceives and retains at a glance the sum total of a\r\nperson’s traits of character.\r\n\r\nEl Greco’s conception of portraiture enters largely into his pictures\r\nat the Louvre, from which we must exclude as an imitation by an\r\ninferior hand the _St. Francis and a Novice_ (No. 1729A). It is\r\ncertainly an important feature in the large _Christ on the Cross, with\r\nTwo Donors_, one of the comparatively recent acquisitions, which still\r\nhangs on a screen in Gallery XV. This great altarpiece has little\r\nof the master’s fierce passion and lightning flashes of colour. The\r\nexpression of the two Donors, Diego and Antonio Covarrubias, who are\r\nseen to the waist at the foot of the Cross, does not go beyond normal\r\npious devotion; and the Saviour seems rather to stand with spread arms\r\nthan to hang on the Cross with all the weight of His characteristically\r\nelongated body. A leaden grey dominates the whole colour scheme. The\r\ncomposition is singularly empty and simple for a master who seemed to\r\nhave a perfect horror of empty spaces. The picture, which is fully\r\nsigned, must have been painted soon after El Greco’s arrival at Toledo\r\n(and not, as Sñr. Cossío thinks, between 1590 and 1600), since one of\r\nthe Donors, the priest Diego Covarrubias, died in 1577.\r\n\r\nComparison of the two Donors’ faces with their portraits by the same\r\nmaster in the Toledo Library can leave no doubt as to their identity.\r\nThe _Christ on the Cross_ was offered by the deputy Isaac Pereire\r\nof Prades (Pyrenées-Orientales) to the local parish church, but was\r\nrefused and hung in the Palais de Justice at Prades, whence it was\r\nremoved to the Mairie in 1904, and finally sold to the Louvre in 1908\r\nfor £1000. The picture measures 8 ft. 8 in. by 5 ft. 8 in.\r\n\r\nThe _St. Louis of France and a Page_ (No. 1729B), which was formerly\r\nwrongly catalogued as _King Ferdinand the Catholic_, is a more typical\r\nexample of El Greco’s management of colour. The boldly painted armour\r\nis identical with that of the St. Martin on horseback, at Toledo. The\r\nprobable date of the picture, which was bought in 1904 at the high\r\nprice of £2800, is between 1594 and 1600.\r\n\r\nBy El Greco’s favourite pupil and assistant, Luis Tristan (1586-1640),\r\nis the realistic half-figure of _St. Francis of Assisi_ (No. 1730).\r\nA more scientific classification of the works by the Toledo painters\r\nhas reversed Sir W. Stirling-Maxwell’s judgment that Tristan had all\r\nthe virtues and none of the faults of his master. He was in reality a\r\nmediocre imitator of El Greco, without a spark of his master’s genius\r\nand without any of his distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SCHOOL OF SEVILLE\r\n\r\nThe naturalistic tendencies inherent in the national Spanish genius,\r\nwhich even in the period of Italian mannerism were not to be entirely\r\ndenied, bore full fruit at Seville, where Francisco Herrera “the\r\nOld” (1576-1656) was the first entirely to reject the tyranny of the\r\nItalian manner, and with it to a certain extent the tyranny of Church\r\npatronage. He was a man of fiery character, with whom the technique\r\nof his art became a veritable passion. It was left to a painter of a\r\nlater century and of another race to proclaim that it does not matter\r\n_what_ you paint, but _how_ you paint; but Herrera’s work at times\r\nalmost suggests that he was guided by similar principles, although an\r\ninstinctive sense of pictorial fitness saved him from the consequences\r\nto which their unrestricted application might easily lead.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the repelling fierceness, the fanaticism, the cruelty\r\nof every single face—all of them portraits, no doubt—in the _St.\r\nBasil dictating his Doctrine_ (No. 1706) at the Louvre, in spite of\r\nthe essentially Spanish manner in which the design fills the space\r\n(the figures being grouped in horizontal courses right across the\r\ncanvas, with very little space above for the sky, and this little\r\nspace filled with angels’ heads and with a Holy Ghost as fierce as\r\nthe rest of the assembly), there is a noble rhythm of line as well as\r\nof the distribution of light and shade, which proclaims the mind of a\r\nmaster. The two Saints in the immediate foreground, St. Dominic and\r\nSt. Bernard, are cut through at the waist—another favourite device of\r\nSpanish composition, which we have already noticed in the Donors of El\r\nGreco’s _Christ on the Cross_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ZURBARÁN\r\n\r\nConsiderable though it be, Herrera’s artistic achievement does not\r\nconstitute his chief claim to fame; for his name will ever be best\r\nknown as that of the first master of the greatest of all Spanish\r\npainters, Don Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velazquez. But before\r\ndiscussing the pictures by, or catalogued under the name of, Velazquez\r\nat the Louvre, we must consider the work of two other painters of\r\nthe Naturalistic school: Francisco de Zurbarán (1598-1661) and José\r\nde Ribera, called “Lo Spagnoletto” (1588-1656). Zurbarán, a pupil of\r\nthe Sevillan Juan de las Roelas, was essentially a painter of church\r\npictures, his favourite subjects being types of monks and scenes of\r\nmonkish life. There is something so sincere and convincing in his\r\nunrelenting realism, that even his pictures of rapturous ecstasy and\r\nstrongly emphasised emotion impress one as truthful renderings of types\r\nobserved by the artist in the streets and churches of monastic Seville.\r\nThe sombre passion with which his subjects are instinct is reflected by\r\nhis colour and masterly chiaroscuro. Zurbarán became Court Painter to\r\nPhilip IV. in or before 1633, in which year he added the words “_Pintor\r\ndel Rey_” to his signature on one of his pictures; and in this\r\ncapacity he painted at Madrid his only known secular pictures, a series\r\nof ten Scenes from the History of Hercules.\r\n\r\nTwo admirable pictures from his brush figure in the Louvre Catalogue as\r\n_St. Peter Nolasque and St. Raymond de Peñafort_ (No. 1738) and _The\r\nFuneral of a Bishop_ (No. 1739). As a matter of fact they represent\r\ntwo scenes from the life of St. Bonaventura: _The Saint presiding at a\r\nChapter of Minor Brothers_, and _The Funeral of St Bonaventura_. The\r\nsecond of these companion pictures which were originally in a convent\r\nat Seville is particularly striking for the unconventionality of its\r\ncomposition, the strong character of the heads, and the masterly\r\ntreatment of the chiaroscuro. Note again the placing of the heads\r\nalmost in a horizontal line right across the canvas, and the anxious\r\navoidance of empty spaces. The third picture that stands to Zurbarán’s\r\nname is the figure of _A Lady of Fashion in the Character of St.\r\nApollonia_ (No. 1740), a work of not very striking merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RIBERA\r\n\r\nRibera, though born near Valencia, where he received his early\r\neducation in the painter’s art in the studio of Ribalta, was still\r\nyoung in years when he left his native land for Italy, never to\r\nreturn. Studying and working at Rome, Parma, and Naples, he was so\r\nstrongly influenced by Caravaggio, and to a minor extent by Correggio,\r\nthat, taking also into account his long domicile, there is some\r\njustification for those who treat him as belonging to the Italian\r\nschool of Naturalists. The most prominent feature of his art is the\r\nviolent and abrupt contrasting of brilliant lights with very deep and\r\nheavy shadows, which enforces the almost cruel dramatic intensity of\r\nhis scenes of torture, convulsions, and suffering. In this use of\r\nchiaroscuro he was a true follower of Caravaggio, but Ribera, even\r\nwhere he is most Italian, never denies his Spanish nationality and the\r\nteaching of his first master.\r\n\r\nNowhere are his racial characteristics more pronounced than in\r\nthe admirable character-study, in the La Caze Room, of a grinning\r\nbeggar-boy who suffers from an infirmity from which the picture derives\r\nits popular name, _The Club-foot_ (No. 1725). The boy is standing\r\nin bold silhouette against a clouded sky. He shoulders his crutch\r\nlike a gun, and carries in his left hand a sheet of paper with the\r\ninscription—DA MIHI ELEMOSINAM PROPTER AMOREM DEI.\r\n\r\nIf _The Club-foot_ is scarcely typical of the qualities that are\r\ngenerally associated with Ribera’s art, the Louvre owns two thoroughly\r\ncharacteristic examples of his more violent manner, of his dramatic\r\nuse of sharply contrasted light and shade, in _The Entombment_ (No.\r\n1722) and _St. Paul the Hermit_ (No. 1723), which bears on a stone the\r\nsignature\r\n\r\n                    JUSEPE DE RIBERA ESPAGNOL P.F.\r\n\r\nIn _The Entombment_ the master-hand is revealed by the superb breadth\r\nwith which the limp yet weighty body of the Saviour is painted. It is\r\nnot modelled in all its plastic roundness, but cut into sharp flat\r\npassages of light and shadow, the plastic relief being suggested by the\r\nperfection of the anatomical drawing and foreshortening. Poignant grief\r\nis expressed in the faces of St. Joseph of Arimathæa, the Virgin Mary,\r\nSt. John, and Nicodemus, who surround the body, the head of which is\r\nsupported by St. Joseph. The same subject is treated with less masterly\r\nauthority in _The Entombment_ (No. 1725A), which can only be accepted\r\nas a school picture.\r\n\r\nThe ascetic fervour tinged with a sense almost of cruel pleasure\r\nin self-inflicted suffering, with which Ribera loved to invest his\r\nsemi-nude figures of emaciated saints, hermits, and martyrs, will be\r\nfound in the _St. Paul the Hermit_. The picture was bought in 1875 for\r\n£252.\r\n\r\nWithout loss of realistic power, and without affectation or conscious\r\nstriving for prettiness, Ribera shows more human tenderness and gentle\r\nemotion in _The Adoration of the Shepherds_ (No. 1721), a picture\r\nsigned and dated on a stone in the right-hand corner,\r\n\r\n           _Juse Ribera español Academico romano, F. 1650._\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the nature of the subject he has here refrained from\r\nmaking use of abrupt light and shade, the whole scene being enveloped\r\nin a warm glow. The types are not idealised, but are apparently\r\nfaithful portraits of their respective models. Very similar to the\r\ncentral group in this canvas, but more sonorous in its depth of colour,\r\nfrom which gleam forth the strong lights, is the _Virgin and Child_\r\n(No. 1724) in the La Caze Room. The four pictures of _Philosophers_\r\n(Nos. 1726-1729), likewise in the La Caze Bequest, which the official\r\nCatalogue gives to Ribera, are certainly not by that master. It has\r\nbeen suggested that they may be the work of Ribera’s facile and\r\nversatile pupil, Luca Giordano (“Fa Presto”), but the poor quality of\r\nthese paintings scarcely justifies even this attribution. They were\r\nformerly in the collection of General Mazzavedo.\r\n\r\nRibera had a romantic career, rising as he did from absolute penury to\r\nalmost despotic power as a member of a triumvirate that would brook no\r\ncompetition in Naples and would shrink from no means to further their\r\nschemes. Nothing is known as to how he died. He disappeared in 1656,\r\nand probably found his death in the depths of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               VELAZQUEZ\r\n\r\nThe Catalogue of the Louvre collection contains an imposing list of\r\nseven works by the king of Spanish painters. Critical examination of\r\nthese pictures will, however, result in the elimination of all but\r\ntwo that figure in the list. Velazquez, who was destined to stamp his\r\ngreat personality on a whole generation of Spanish painters, but whose\r\nart was little known in Northern Europe previous to the Peninsular\r\nWar, has exercised a paramount influence on modern art. He was born of\r\nnoble descent at Seville in June 1599. Although originally destined for\r\nanother profession, he showed such talent for art that he was allowed\r\nto enter the studio of Francisco Herrera, of whose realistic tendencies\r\nand rugged strength we have already had occasion to speak.\r\n\r\nFrom his studio he passed into that of the cultured and erudite\r\nFrancisco Pacheco, whose artistic achievement at its best was far\r\nin advance of his professed academic principles. Summoned to Madrid\r\nin 1623 by the powerful Count Duke of Olivarez, Velazquez entered\r\nthe service of King Philip IV. Velazquez became his favourite Court\r\nPainter, received other important offices and emoluments, and after\r\nhis return from his second visit to Italy in 1651—the first visit had\r\ntaken place in 1629—he was appointed _Aposentador del Rey_, a post\r\nwhich approximately corresponds with that of Court-Marshal. He died on\r\nthe 6th of August 1660, from the results of fatigue and overwork in\r\nsupervising the arrangements for the betrothal of the Infanta Maria\r\nTeresa to Louis XIV. at the Palace on the Isle of Pheasants, at Irun.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the early _bodegones_ of his student-years and\r\na few rare excursions into the realm of religious and mythological\r\ncomposition, Velazquez’s life-work, as conditioned by the patronage of\r\nthe king and the Court, was practically confined to portraiture. His\r\nunrivalled greatness in this sphere is due to the perfect clearness\r\nof his vision, which made him grasp the person or scene before his\r\neyes at a single glance, and transpose his impression to canvas with\r\nundisturbed directness and completeness, and with an apparent disregard\r\nof the means of expression. There is dignity and soberness in all his\r\nportraits; perfect spacing; noble, firm contour; complete unity of\r\nall the parts produced by the sense of ambient atmosphere. And never is\r\nthere the slightest hint of trick of hand, or mannerism, or painting by\r\nrecipe. Each picture is the result of close observation, recorded with\r\nadmirable directness and honesty. This supreme master of the painter’s\r\ntechnique seemed to pay no attention to technique—or, at least, the\r\nresult is invariably so significant and so absorbingly interesting\r\nthat the spectator, unless he approaches the picture with deliberate\r\nintention to probe its secret, never thinks of the technical means by\r\nwhich life so convincing has been breathed on to the canvas.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                         PLATE XXV.—VELAZQUEZ\r\n\r\n                              (1599-1660)\r\n\r\n                            SPANISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n              No. 1731.—PORTRAIT OF THE INFANTA MARGARITA\r\n\r\n                (Portrait de l’infante Margarita Maria)\r\n\r\n  The Infanta, who appears to be about four years of age, is wearing\r\n  a white robe embroidered with black.

(0·70 × 0·59.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE INFANTA\r\n\r\nIn the Louvre collection there is but one picture from which it is\r\npossible to judge the greatness of Velazquez’s art. That picture is\r\nthe deservedly famous and often-copied portrait of the little _Infanta\r\nMargarita_ (No. 1731, Plate XXV.), which has rightly been placed in the\r\nSalon Carré among the proudest possessions which the Gallery can boast.\r\nThe little princess, who was born in 1651, the first child of Mariana\r\nof Austria, is here depicted at the age of about four, so that the date\r\nof the portrait may safely be assumed to be about the year 1655, and\r\nnot 1659, as suggested by M. Lafenestre. She is dressed in a white robe\r\nwith black lace trimmings. A pink ribbon is tied on her right side to\r\nher soft light golden hair, which falls in curls to her shoulders; her\r\nright hand rests upon a chair, whilst the left, the fingers of which\r\nhave been repainted owing to the addition of a narrow strip of canvas\r\nat the bottom, holds a flower. On the top the words LINFANTE MARGVERITE\r\nare painted in heavy block letters across the whole width of the\r\ncanvas. This picture, in which childlike ingenuousness is so happily\r\nblended with quaint dignity, and in which even the forbidding ugliness\r\nof the dress of the period cannot destroy the little princess’s grace\r\nand doll-like charm, Velazquez has surely left to the world one of the\r\nmost entrancing portraits of lovable childhood that is to be found in\r\nthe whole history of art.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MARIANA OF AUSTRIA\r\n\r\nThe other unquestionably authentic work by the master at the Louvre is\r\nto be found in the La Caze Bequest. It is catalogued as _Portrait of\r\nthe Infanta Maria Teresa, afterwards Queen of France_ (No. 1735), but\r\nis in reality a portrait of _Queen Mariana of Austria_, the mother of\r\nthe Infanta Margarita Maria. Mariana was married to Philip IV. as his\r\nsecond wife in 1649, at the age of fourteen. Velazquez was at that time\r\nin Italy, so that the duty of painting her first portrait for the royal\r\nbridegroom fell to the Court Painter’s son-in-law and chief pupil, Juan\r\nBautista del Mazo (1610-1667).\r\n\r\nThe portrait at the Louvre was, if we may judge from the apparent age\r\nof the child-queen as she is here represented, painted in 1651, when\r\nVelazquez had returned from his second Italian journey and when Mariana\r\nwas sixteen years of age. It was probably a preliminary study from life\r\nfor the larger portrait in the Vienna Gallery. This admirable portrait\r\nis another artistic triumph over unfavourable conditions imposed by\r\nthe hideousness of contemporary female attire, although the forehead\r\nhas been spoilt by clumsy repainting. The coiffure in particular, a\r\ncascade of false hair, bows, jewels, and feathers, is more suggestive\r\nof some exotic idol or fetish than of a human being. In 1863, before\r\nthe judgment of a tasteless age, which gave Velazquez a position far\r\nbelow the then absurdly overrated Murillo, was revised, this portrait\r\nof Mariana appeared at the Viardot sale and failed to realise more than\r\n£200!\r\n\r\n\r\n                      COPIES AND SCHOOL PICTURES\r\n\r\nTwo other portraits in the La Caze Room are attributed to Velazquez.\r\nOne of these, a _Portrait of Philip IV._ (No. 1733) at the age of about\r\nfifty, is unquestionably a wholly uninspired and fairly modern copy of\r\nthe head in the Prado (No. 1080). The other, a _Portrait of a Young\r\nWoman_ (No. 1736), is an extremely feeble imitation of the superficial\r\naspect of Velazquez’s manner—so bad in drawing, especially in the\r\nattachment of the nose to the face, that it is difficult to accept\r\nSeñor Beruete’s attribution of this picture to Juan Carreño de Miranda\r\n(1614-1685), an able painter of the Madrid school. M. Henri Rodolphe\r\nElissa, who exposed the “Tiara of Saitaphernes” forgery, has asserted\r\nthat he can prove both the _Philip IV._ and the _Young Woman_ to be\r\nthe work of the Spanish painter Escosura, who died in the last decade\r\nof the nineteenth century. There appears to be no reason to doubt his\r\nassertion. The head of Philip, more than the other picture, appears to\r\nbe nineteenth-century work.\r\n\r\nThe _Portrait of Philip IV., King of Spain, in Hunting Costume_ (No.\r\n1732), with a gun in his right hand and a dog sitting by his side, in\r\na landscape background, is only a contemporary copy of a very similar\r\npicture in the Prado, to which it is vastly inferior in execution. It\r\nis true that in the Prado picture the king’s hat is on his head, whilst\r\nin the Louvre version, which is probably by Mazo, he carries it in his\r\nleft hand. It is, however, possible to detect in the Prado portrait\r\nclear evidence of a pentimento, from which it can be seen that here,\r\ntoo, the hat was originally in the same position as in the Louvre\r\ncanvas. Presumably Velazquez subsequently made the alteration; but the\r\ncopy was executed at an earlier date.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE “MEETING OF THIRTEEN PEOPLE”\r\n\r\nThere have been great divergences of opinion concerning the strange\r\nlittle painting representing a _Meeting of Thirteen People_ (No. 1734)\r\non a hill. It was formerly known as _A Meeting of Artists_, because\r\ntwo of the Spanish cavaliers depicted in the group were believed to\r\nrepresent Velazquez and Murillo. Lauded at first as one of Velazquez’s\r\nmasterpieces by those who were carried away by the truly extraordinary\r\nbeauty of the pearly, opalescent colour harmony and the atmospheric\r\nquality of the painting, the little picture has lately been as\r\nviolently abused for its “poor design, weak execution, and commonplace\r\narrangement.” As a matter of fact the arrangement is anything but\r\ncommonplace, and the picture has great qualities of technique which\r\nwill always be the delight of professional artists. It is moreover\r\nadmirably varied in gesture and action, even if it has certain\r\nweaknesses which render impossible its unqualified attribution to\r\nVelazquez. Here we have clearly an excellent example of his son-in-law\r\nand imitator, J. B. del Mazo. If any proof were needed for this\r\nattribution, it will be found in the figure on the extreme left of the\r\ncomposition. Both his legs are slanting forward so much that his centre\r\nof gravity plumbs behind his heels. It would really be impossible to\r\nmaintain this posture, which, though it offends against the laws of\r\ngravity, is to be found in quite a number of Mazo’s pictures, as, for\r\ninstance, in the small figure of Olivarez (?) in the middle distance\r\non the right in the Duke of Westminster’s _Don Baltazar Carlos in the\r\nRiding School_, in the portrait of _Don Baltazar Carlos_ at The Hague,\r\nand in the second boy in _The Family of Mazo_ at the Vienna Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe soundly painted _Portrait of Don Pedro de Altamira, Doyen of the\r\nChapel Royal at Toledo, afterwards Cardinal_ (No. 1737), inscribed\r\non the background “ÆT 54 DV, 1633,” is a good character-study of an\r\nenergetic and rather worldly-looking Church dignitary, but does not\r\nappear to be either by Velazquez or one of his immediate followers.\r\n\r\nThere is in the Spanish section of the Louvre another superbly painted,\r\nbut very problematic, _Head of a Man_ (No. 1747), which, on no more\r\nplausible grounds than an accidental likeness to one of the figures\r\nin _The Forge of Vulcan_, has by some critics been believed to be by\r\nVelazquez. The rich impasto and the careful finish of the painting are\r\nutterly unlike Velazquez’s manner; nor does the picture appear to be\r\nof his period. But whoever may be its author, it is one of the most\r\nremarkable paintings in this section of the Louvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MURILLO\r\n\r\nBy far the best represented of all the masters at the Spanish school is\r\nBartolomé Estéban Murillo (1618?-1682). He was born at Seville, of poor\r\nparents, and studied as a boy under Juan del Castillo. Forced before he\r\nhad reached manhood to gain his livelihood, he took to manufacturing\r\nartistically worthless devotional pictures on saga-cloth, for sale at\r\nthe weekly fairs in the poor quarter of Seville. This early practice\r\nof rather mechanical production, and the habit, acquired by necessity,\r\nof working to please the public, clung to him in after life and are\r\nresponsible for much that the modern mind finds distasteful in his\r\nart—a certain sickly sentimentality that often takes the place of real\r\nsentiment, and an artificiality of arrangement even where the types are\r\nrealistic renderings of the people among whom he spent his days.\r\n\r\nWith his small savings from the proceeds of his crude popular pictures\r\nMurillo proceeded to Madrid, where Velazquez assisted him by deed,\r\nadvice, and example, though the two artists were probably never in the\r\nrelation of master and pupil. After about two years thus profitably\r\nspent at Madrid, Murillo returned to Seville, where he continued to\r\nwork until his death in 1682, and rose to the very summit of fame and\r\npopularity. At his best Murillo was a colourist of great charm and a\r\ntechnician of the rarest skill. His art is most admirable where he\r\nadheres most closely to the realistic tradition of his country. It\r\nis scarcely to be credited that the same hand which produced so many\r\nvaporous and vapid Madonnas is responsible for a picture painted with\r\nsuch superb breadth and incisive vigour as _The Young Beggar_ (No.\r\n1717), which is almost worthy of the brush of Velazquez in his Sevillan\r\nperiod. The decidedly unsavoury subject is made acceptable by the\r\nconsummate artistry of the treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      “THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION”\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, to pictures of this type that Murillo owed his\r\nwidespread popularity. Generations of enthusiastic admirers have\r\nstood in silent awe before his large painting of _The Immaculate\r\nConception_ (No. 1709, Plate XXVI.), which is certainly one of the best\r\nof innumerable versions of the same subject—the Virgin standing on a\r\ncrescent moon, with ecstatic gaze, and hands pressed to her breast,\r\nand surrounded by swarms of joyous angel-children—painted by Murillo\r\nto meet an apparently insatiable demand. There is something of real\r\necstasy in this conception. To find a similar _morbidezza_ of pigment\r\none must turn to certain famous works by Andrea del Sarto: it is a\r\nquality which is generally conspicuously absent from Spanish painting\r\nand which, if carried a step farther, as it sometimes was carried by\r\nMurillo, would result in fuzzy vapidness. This famous picture has the\r\ndistinction of being the most costly purchase ever made for the Louvre,\r\nthe price paid for it at the Marshal Soult sale in 1852—that is\r\nmany years before American competition had established the vastly\r\nenhanced standards of value which now prevail—being as much as 615,300\r\nfr., or £24,612.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                          PLATE XXVI.—MURILLO\r\n\r\n                             (1618?-1682)\r\n\r\n                            SPANISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                  No. 1709—THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION\r\n\r\n                (La Conception immaculée de la Vierge)\r\n\r\n  The Virgin, wearing a white robe with a blue mantle over her left\r\n  shoulder, has her hands crossed over her breast; she is standing in\r\n  the hollow of a two-horned crescent, and gazing heavenwards. About\r\n  twenty-one cherubs and ten heads are seen in different parts of the\r\n  composition.\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on canvas.\r\n\r\n  9 ft. 0 in. × 6 ft. 3 in. (2·74 × 1·90.)]\r\n\r\nApparently of earlier date is the other version of the same subject at\r\nthe Louvre. This _Immaculate Conception_ (No. 1708) is not painted in\r\nthe same spirit of exaltation as the version just described, but has\r\na happy passage of realistic character-painting in the six kneeling\r\nfigures on the left. On the right two angels carry a scroll with\r\nthe inscription IN PRINCIPIO DILEXIT EAM. The picture was painted\r\nin 1656-57 for the Church of Santa Maria la Blanca at Seville, and\r\nwas carried off to France, with many other of the master’s works, by\r\nMarshal Soult.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE “BIRTH OF THE VIRGIN”\r\n\r\nAnother picture that formed part of the loot taken by Napoleon’s\r\ngeneral and was taken in 1855 from his son, the Duke of Dalmatia, in\r\nliquidation of a debt of £6000, is _The Birth of the Virgin_ (No.\r\n1710). The National Gallery in London owns a small preliminary study\r\nfor this painting, which was executed in 1655 for Seville Cathedral.\r\nThe centre is occupied by a beautifully disposed group of four women\r\nand four winged heavenly visitors attending to the Infant’s bath; in\r\nthe background on the left St. Anne, raised in her bed, is receiving\r\nvisitors, and on the right are seen two attendants airing linen at\r\na fireplace. The strange assemblage, in which the earthly and the\r\nheavenly are without incongruity brought into such close contact that\r\none of the boy-angels is actually occupied with a dog, is completed\r\nby another four angels floating in the air above the Infant. In\r\ncomposition, distribution of light and shade, and in harmonious\r\nblending of mellow colour this picture ranks among Murillo’s highest\r\nachievements. According to Cean Bermudez, the roundness, beauty of\r\nshape, and rosy complexion of the waiting-woman’s arm in the foreground\r\n“excited the jealous envy of the ladies of Seville.” It is interesting\r\nto note that before its acquisition by the Louvre the _Birth of the\r\nVirgin_ was brought to England in 1823, when the owners vainly tried to\r\nfind a purchaser.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         “THE ANGELS’ KITCHEN”\r\n\r\nYet another deservedly famous work by Murillo, removed from a\r\nFranciscan convent at Seville by the insatiable greed of Marshal Soult,\r\nis the now extensively restored large picture known as _The Miracle of\r\nSan Diego_, or _The Angels’ Kitchen_ (No. 1716). The composition is\r\ndivided by two large figures of angels into two halves. On the left two\r\nknights of Calatrava are shown in by a Franciscan brother and behold\r\nSt. Diego in prayer miraculously raised into the air and surrounded\r\nby a flood of light. On the right the angels are occupied with the\r\npreparation of the repast for which the Saint has sent his prayer to\r\nthe Virgin. A Franciscan is watching the scene from the distance with\r\na gesture of amazement. Here again the real and the supernatural are\r\nblended with unaffected naïveté, the unity of the contending elements\r\nbeing established by the masterly rendering of light and atmosphere.\r\nAn account of the miracle is given on a cartouche in the foreground;\r\nwhilst a piece of paper on the left holds the signature\r\n\r\n                       BART-EST. MURILLO, 1646.\r\n\r\n_The Angels’ Kitchen_ was bought from the despoiler’s heirs for £3420.\r\n\r\n_The Virgin of the Rosary_ (No. 1712), unlike the majority of Murillo’s\r\nrepresentations of the Mother of God, has scarcely a trace of spiritual\r\nexaltation, but is merely a handsome type of a happy and contented\r\nSpanish mother. The folds of her outer garment are arranged in florid\r\nand meaningless profusion.\r\n\r\n_The Holy Family_ (No. 1713), also known as _The Virgin of Seville_, is\r\na genuine and characteristic, though strangely overrated work by the\r\nmaster, and bears the signature\r\n\r\n                    BARTOLOM DE MURILLO F. HISPAN.\r\n\r\n_The Virgin in Glory_ (No. 1711) is, to say the least, of doubtful\r\nauthenticity. The small companion pictures, _Christ in the Garden of\r\nOlives_ (No. 1714) and _Christ at the Column and St. Peter_ (No. 1715),\r\nare painted on marble, to which fact they owe the unpleasant coldness\r\nof their colouring.\r\n\r\nIn the La Caze Room are two portraits, _The Poet Quevedo_ (No. 1718)\r\nand _The Duke of Ossuña_ (No. 1719), which the official Catalogue\r\nascribes to Murillo. Quite apart from the fact that the artist was\r\nonly six years of age when the Duke of Ossuña died, the quality of\r\nthe painting does not justify these attributions. Like the head of\r\nPhilip IV. in the same room, they were probably painted by Escosura, a\r\nlate-nineteenth-century Spaniard\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SCHOOL OF MADRID\r\n\r\nWe must now return to Madrid, where the example of Velazquez had\r\ninspired a fairly numerous group of able painters without particular\r\ngenius, whose art, being entirely derivative, carried within itself\r\nthe germ of decay and sank to complete insignificance before the close\r\nof the century. The most distinguished artist of this group is Juan\r\nBautista del Mazo, who has already been referred to as the author\r\nof the _Meeting of Thirteen People_ and probably of the _Philip IV.\r\nin Hunting Costume_. So well did he succeed in appropriating his\r\nfather-in-law’s style that his best works have frequently passed under\r\nhis illustrious master’s name.\r\n\r\nAnother important painter of the Madrid school is Carreño de Miranda\r\n(Nos. 1614-1685), who benefited by Velazquez’s patronage, became\r\npainter of the Palace in 1669, and Court Painter and Assistant\r\nSeneschal in 1671. Although in his later years he devoted himself\r\nlargely to subject pictures which are distinguished by a warmer\r\ncolouring than most of the productions by the Madrid school of the\r\nperiod, he achieved his greatest successes as a portrait painter. He\r\nwas considerably influenced by the paintings of Van Dyck, which he\r\nhad occasion to study in the royal palaces. His large _St. Ambrose\r\ndistributing Alms_ (No. 1702), in the La Caze Gallery, is a hurriedly\r\nexecuted work which does not show his art to the best advantage. It\r\nfigured in the sale of the Soult collection, when it failed to realise\r\n£20.\r\n\r\nFar more typical of its author’s best manner is _The Burning Bush_ (No.\r\n1703) by Francisco Collantes (1599-1656), a Madrid painter who studied\r\nunder Vincente Carducho, but was influenced by Bassano. He was an\r\nexcellent colourist, especially in his landscape paintings with small\r\nfigures. His most famous picture is _The Vision of Ezekiel_, formerly\r\nat the Buen Retiro Palace and now in the Prado Gallery.\r\n\r\nJuan de Arellano (1614-1676), the painter of the _Flowers_ (No. 1701),\r\nworked at Madrid, unknown and in abject poverty, until at the age of\r\nthirty-six he began to devote himself to flower-painting, a branch\r\nof art in which he developed considerable skill, and rose to great\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nYet another Madrid painter who is but indifferently represented at the\r\nLouvre by a still life of _Fruit and Musical Instruments_ (No. 1720)\r\nin the La Caze collection, is Antonio Pereda (1599-1669). Although a\r\ncontemporary of Velazquez and working in the same city, he was not\r\nappreciably influenced by that master. He was a pupil of Pedro de las\r\nCuevas, and his style shows certain affinities with Ribera. His works\r\nare rarely to be met with outside the galleries and churches of his own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe end of the seventeenth century marked the complete decadence of the\r\nSpanish school, which was precipitated and received its final seal by\r\nthe advent in 1692 of the Neapolitan Luca Giordano, whose rare facility\r\nin the production of showy, flashy, meretricious works earned for him\r\nthe sobriquet “Fa Presto,” and whose prodigious success was a powerful\r\nincentive to emulation. More fatal even than the influence of Luca\r\nGiordano was that of the German artist Raphael Mengs, an uninspired\r\neclectic who became Court Painter to Charles III., and who is referred\r\nto in the chapter dealing with the German pictures at the Louvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 GOYA\r\n\r\nIn this time of complete stagnation the fascinating personality of\r\nFrancisco Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828) flashes like a bright meteor\r\nthrough the dark night of Spanish art. Goya takes a unique position\r\nin the art of his country—or, indeed, of the world. He was as much\r\nthe last of the old masters as he is the first of the moderns. A man\r\nof fiery temperament, impulsive, unruly, opposed to authority, he was\r\nterribly unequal in his performance. It is as unnecessary to state\r\nwho were his masters as it is impossible to speak of his style in\r\ngeneral terms, for there probably never was an artist who worked in\r\nso many different styles, experimented in so many different mediums,\r\nand treated so vast a range of subjects as Goya. He was a creature of\r\nmoods, and changed his method of painting as easily as his political\r\nallegiance from Bourbon to Bonaparte and back again to Bourbon.\r\n\r\nHis four pictures at the Louvre are without exception portraits, and do\r\nnot therefore illustrate his highly developed sense of the dramatic.\r\nBut they serve admirably to show his active protest against the\r\nclassicist affectation prevalent at his time, and his return to the\r\nhealthy realism which is the heritage of his race. The _Portrait of F.\r\nGuillemardet, Ambassador of the French Republic to Spain_ (No. 1704),\r\nis an admirably honest piece of portraiture, dignified but perfectly\r\nnatural in pose, strong in expression and pleasing in colour. It was\r\nbequeathed to the Louvre by Guillemardet, together with the _Young\r\nSpanish Woman_ (No. 1705) in a black mantilla, standing with crossed\r\narms against a pearly-grey landscape background. The seated half-figure\r\nof the rather corpulent _Young Spanish Woman_ (No. 1705A) was bought\r\nat the Kums sale at Antwerp for £1276; and the portrait of _Don Perez\r\nde Castro_ (No. 1705B) was acquired in 1902 for £1200. Goya was an\r\nisolated figure in Spanish art of the time. He left no “school,” but\r\nhis influence was one of the leading factors in the rise of the modern\r\nmovement in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already followed the development of the early Flemish or\r\nNetherlandish art during the fifteenth century, and observed how\r\nit eventually passed under the Italianising influences which are\r\nunmistakable in the pictures of Barend van Orley (1495?-1542) and\r\nhis contemporaries. The early painters of Holland as distinct from\r\nFlanders cannot be traced with any certainty much farther back than\r\nAlbert von Ouwater (fl. 1420-1460), who worked at Haarlem from 1430 to\r\n1460. As we have already seen, the early Flemish painter, Gerard David\r\n(1460?-1523), was born at Ouwater, which may well have had its school\r\nof painters. Neither Albert von Ouwater, who is represented to-day by\r\na single work, the _Raising of Lazarus_ in the Berlin Gallery, nor his\r\nunidentifiable contemporary who painted the _Exhumation of St. Hubert_,\r\nin the National Gallery (No. 783), are included in the collection of\r\npictures at the Louvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GERARD OF HAARLEM\r\n\r\nThe influence of these painters and Dierick Bouts is seen in the rare\r\nworks of Geertgen tot S. Jans, or Gerard of Haarlem (1465-1493) whose\r\n_Raising of Lazarus_ (No. 2563A) in this collection is an achievement\r\nof the highest order, and was purchased as recently as 1902 for £4000\r\nfrom Baron d’Albenas, after having been for many years in Spain. This\r\npupil or follower of the Ouwater master was a native of Leyden, and\r\nworked at Haarlem. He took his name from the commandery of the Knights\r\nof St. John at Haarlem for whom he worked, as we see from the careful\r\ninscription, “_Gerardus Leydanus pictor ad S. Io. Baptist. Harlem\r\npinxt_,” on his triptych at Vienna.\r\n\r\nAmong his contemporaries were Cornelis Engelbrechtsen, who was born\r\nin 1468 at Leyden, where he died in 1533, and Lucas van Leyden\r\n(1494-1533). The latter played an important part as an engraver quite\r\nas much as a painter in the university town of Leyden, which now\r\npossesses his large _Last Judgment_ and became famous as the birthplace\r\nof Rembrandt in 1606. The Louvre possesses no picture by either\r\nEngelbrechtsen or Lucas van Leyden.\r\n\r\nJacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen (fl. 1470-1533) is also unrepresented\r\nhere. Portraits by painters in this group are often confused, as in\r\nthe case of the _Portrait of the Duke of East Friesland_, in the\r\nOldenburg Gallery, which has been attributed to both Lucas van Leyden\r\nand Jacob Cornelisz. A pupil of the latter may have painted the _Cana\r\nof Galilee_ (No. 2640C). It is safe to assign to “the Master of the\r\nFemale Half Figures,” the _Young Lady Reading_ (No. 2641C), which has\r\na close analogy with the well-known picture in the Harrach collection\r\nat Vienna, representing half-length figures of three young ladies in\r\ncrimson velvet dresses cut square at the neck, and singing to the\r\naccompaniment of a flute and a lute. The name of this painter is\r\nnot known, but his pictures, which are neither numerous nor of any\r\nconspicuous merit, are easily recognisable.\r\n\r\nTo this period of transition and mediocre painting belongs Jan Scorel\r\n(1495-1562), whose _Portrait of Paracelsus the Doctor_ (No. 2567A) is\r\ninscribed:\r\n\r\n                     “FORMOSO DOCTOR PARASELSUS,”\r\n\r\nand is in every way superior to the _Portrait of a Man_ (No. 2641B),\r\nwhich is labelled with the name of Scorel, but catalogued as being by\r\nan unknown artist. From Scorel, a much travelled Dutch artist, who at\r\none time worked at Nuremburg with Albrecht Dürer and visited Venice\r\nand the East, we naturally pass to Jan Mostaert of Haarlem. Mostaert\r\nof Haarlem is unrepresented at the Louvre, a remark which equally well\r\napplies to the anonymous “Pseudo-Mostaert,” who painted so much in his\r\nstyle that a large number of inferior productions have been credited to\r\nhim from time to time. Pictures of this type vary so considerably that\r\nthe name “Pseudo-Mostaert” is little more than a generic designation\r\nfor unassignable Flemish and Dutch pictures of the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century; such pictures bear some relationship to the _Christ\r\nbearing His Cross_ (No. 2299), and the _Abraham’s Sacrifice_ (No.\r\n2300), officially attributed to the little-known and quite negligible\r\npainter Alart Claeszoon (1498-1564) of Leyden.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SIR ANTONIS MOR\r\n\r\nFrom Leyden we may pass to Utrecht, which was the birthplace of the\r\nmuch-travelled, distinguished, and cosmopolitan painter, Antonis Mor\r\n(1512-1578?). He was a pupil of Jan Scorel, but soon freed himself\r\nfrom the hard manner he acquired under that master by his study in\r\nItaly of the best works of the Venetians. Indeed, some of his pictures\r\nhave passed as the work of Calcar, the pupil of Titian. Mor, or Moro,\r\nexcelled as a painter of vigorous and truthful portraits, and the\r\nportraits and replicas he painted of Queen Mary are well known. The\r\nPrado Gallery at Madrid and the Vienna Gallery contain good examples\r\nof his art, and he is fairly well represented in the Louvre. While he\r\nwas in the service of Philip II. of Spain he lived in much splendour,\r\nand was amply paid for his work. His close intimacy with the monarch\r\ninduced him on one occasion to take the liberty of touching with a\r\nbrush dipped in red paint the hand of the king. This serious breach\r\nof Court etiquette created a profound impression on the courtiers\r\npresent; and, although the painter sued for pardon and obtained it from\r\nthe king, he soon recognised that he had made himself obnoxious to the\r\nInquisition, who asserted that Moro had got from the heretic English,\r\nwhile painting the portrait of Queen Mary, a charm that enabled him to\r\nbewitch the Spanish monarch. Being thus compelled to leave Spain, he\r\nsettled in Antwerp, where he died between 1576 and 1578.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of Mor, who was the contemporary of Titian, at different\r\nperiods of his art bear traces of the Dutch, Spanish, and Flemish\r\nschools. He in turn also had an influence on the portrait painters of\r\nSpain half a century before the birth of Velazquez. The _Portrait of a\r\nMan_ (No. 2478), which is signed and dated:\r\n\r\n                     “_ANT MORO pingebat, 1565_,”\r\n\r\nwas in the past held by some writers to bear the features of Sir\r\nFrancis Drake, who was, however, at the date here given only twenty-one\r\nyears of age. The two large paintings in the Duchâtel Bequest which\r\npass as the _Portrait of Louis de Rio_ and _His Wife_ (No. 2480 and No.\r\n2481) are, judging by the attitudes of the figures and the shape of the\r\npanels, the wings of a large altarpiece. _The Dwarf of Charles V._ (No.\r\n2479) reminds us that the painter, while still young, was taken into\r\nthe service of that emperor. _The Portrait of Edward VI. of England_\r\n(No. 2481A) bears a very suspicious-looking inscription.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SPANISH OPPRESSION\r\n\r\nThe political events of the reign of Philip II. of Spain, the mistaken,\r\nmischievous, and oppressive policy he adopted with regard to his\r\nterritory in the Netherlands, and the contempt with which he treated\r\nhis Dutch subjects, soon alienated their sympathies; but the Duke of\r\nAlva by his harshness and bigotry incited them to frenzy. When he set\r\nforth in 1567, all hope of peace and mercy fled before him, and within\r\na short period his tyranny and ferocity fanned the flame of rebellion,\r\nwhich after a struggle of eighty years was to end in the Peace of\r\nMünster of 1648. In that year Spain ignominiously surrendered, and\r\nthe independence of the northern Netherlands was recognised. During\r\nthe long period which elapsed between the Union of Utrecht in 1579\r\nand the negotiations at Osnabrück and Münster in 1648 must have been\r\ndestroyed innumerable religious pictures, the loss of which renders it\r\nalmost impossible for us to estimate the full significance of artistic\r\nendeavour in Holland in the closing years of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nA new era in Dutch history, social life and art was beginning to\r\nopen out by the year 1612, when Abraham Blomaert (1564-1651) painted\r\nand signed his very large _Nativity_ (No. 2327), which was formerly\r\nattributed to Bernardino Fassolo. Blomaert’s _Portrait of a Man_ (No.\r\n2327A) is also a signed work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HISTORY AND PORTRAIT PAINTERS\r\n\r\nBlomaert’s contemporary, Michiel Jansz Mierevelt (1567-1641), who\r\nwas at one time Court painter to the Princes of Orange at The Hague,\r\nand was with undue flattery hailed as the “New Xeuxis of Delft,” is\r\nrepresented by the _Portrait of Olden Barnevelt_ (No. 2465) and three\r\nother portraits, one of which (No. 2466) is in a very bad state. Stiff\r\nbut characteristic is the _Portrait of a Woman_ (No. 2534), which was\r\npainted by Jan van Ravesteyn (1572-1657) in 1633, while his initials\r\nare also found on a panel (No. 2535) which was commissioned of him in\r\nthe following year. Although Gerard Verspronck (1600-1651) was many\r\nyears his junior, and in 1641, in the period of his maturity, achieved\r\nthe _Portrait of a Lady_ (No. 2576A), the top corners of which have\r\nbeen added, he painted on the lines of tradition, and showed little\r\noriginality. He came under the influence of Frans Hals, under whose\r\nname his pictures often pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CORNELIS JANSSEN\r\n\r\nNor can it be said that the numerous portraits which Cornelis Janssen\r\nvan Ceulen (1593-1664?) undertook in England, give signs of the new\r\nartistic impulse which was daily manifesting itself in Holland in the\r\nearly works of Frans Hals. Janssen, who was baptized at the Dutch\r\nReformed Church, Austin Friars, London, throve until the establishment\r\nin England of Van Dyck, before whom he quickly had to give way;\r\nalthough he withdrew to Kent and lived in retirement, he did not\r\nreceive the Speaker’s warrant to pass beyond seas until 1643. That\r\n“Cornelius Johnson Picture Drawer” made use of pallid flesh tones and\r\nlifeless grey tones, is obvious from the two portraits (No. 2338 and\r\nNo. 2339) exhibited in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nThe very modern looking _Portrait of a Young Man_ (No. 2303A), signed\r\n“D. BAILLY,” is officially held to be the work of a Leyden painter of\r\nthat name who would appear to have been a contemporary of Cornelis\r\nJanssen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FRANS HALS\r\n\r\nAlthough the great Dutch painter, Frans Hals (1580?-1666) was born\r\nat Antwerp, his parents were natives of Haarlem, whither he removed\r\nabout 1600, and where he settled for the remainder of his eventful,\r\nirregular, and improvident career. This lusty and unromantic master by\r\nhis forceful characterisation, his rapid wielding of his brush, and his\r\nfrank realism, in a few years transformed the earlier portrait-making\r\nof Holland, and the rendering of the commonplace and obvious\r\nlikeness of an individual, as seen in the works of Moreelse and\r\nothers, into the region of great art. He was by about a quarter of\r\na century the senior of Rembrandt, who is the greatest genius among\r\nDutch painters, and developed his art on logical lines. It is, however,\r\nnecessary to know the outstanding facts of his personal history, the\r\nfluctuating circumstances under which he worked, and the grinding\r\npoverty of his latest period. Perhaps no other painter in the whole\r\nrange of art was so affected by his environment as Hals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                        PLATE XXVII.—FRANS HALS\r\n\r\n                             (1580?-1666)\r\n\r\n                             DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                       No. 2384.—THE GIPSY GIRL\r\n\r\n                            (La Bohémienne)\r\n\r\n  She wears a red dress, which is open at the neck; she smiles as she\r\n  turns her eyes to the right; half-length figure.\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on canvas.\r\n\r\n  2 ft. 6 in. × 2 ft. 3 in. (0·76 × 0·68.)]\r\n\r\nWhether he was a pupil of Cornelis Cornelissen, Hendrick Goltzius, and\r\nKarel van Mander (the Dutch Vasari), is not known with any certainty,\r\nand no picture painted by him earlier than 1613, when he may have been\r\nthirty-three years of age, is known to-day. Early in the year 1616,\r\nwhen he painted his famous _Banquet of the Officers of the St. Joris\r\nShooting Guild_, one of his early masterpieces still preserved in the\r\nsmall gallery at Haarlem, he was summoned before the Burgomaster of the\r\n“town of the tulip,” and reprimanded for his cruelty to his first wife.\r\nExactly a year later he married a second time, and as the years went on\r\nhe became the father of at least six sons who adopted the profession\r\nof the painter but earned no permanent success. The Louvre possesses\r\nno example of his Doelen-pieces of archer-groups which won him his\r\nearliest fame in his own country, but is fortunate enough to contain\r\nthe famous _Gipsy Girl_ (No. 2384, Plate XXVII.), which alone would\r\nhave earned for him the title of “the master of the laugh.” It passed\r\nthrough the Ménars sale in 1792 for 301 livres. The three pictures of\r\nthe Beresteyn family were bought for £4000 in 1884, when his paintings\r\nwere not as highly prized as they are to-day. They give an excellent\r\nidea of the virility his art had attained by about 1629. The best of\r\nthese is the _Portrait of Nicolaes van Beresteyn_ (No. 2386), which is\r\ninscribed, “AETAT SUAE 40. 1629.” His hands are superbly painted; while\r\nthe companion _Portrait_ (No. 2387) of his wife is equally striking.\r\nThe large and imposing _Portrait-Group of the Beresteyn Family_ (No.\r\n2388) is marred by the excessive use in places of a strong red, and has\r\nbeen enlarged by the addition down the right side of the canvas of a\r\nstrip about fourteen inches broad, but yet shows a certain felicity of\r\ngrouping, and a joyous and exuberant outlook. _The Portrait, of René\r\nDescartes, the French Philosopher_ (No. 2383) is so simple in treatment\r\nand so easy in pose, that it makes an instant appeal to the student.\r\nAnother _Portrait of Descartes_ (No. 78), by Sébastien Bourdon, is\r\nin this gallery, and a third was in the Arsène Houssaye collection.\r\nThe _Portrait of a Lady in a Black Dress_ (No. 2385, Plate XXVIII.)\r\nis unaffected and lifelike, while the subtle and hasty brushing in of\r\nthe gloves could only have been done by a great painter. It seems to\r\nhave been generally overlooked that a study for this picture is in the\r\ncollection of Lord Ronald Gower, and has for some time past been on\r\nloan to the FitzWilliam Museum, Cambridge. In the study, however, the\r\nartist had not yet thought of the gloves.\r\n\r\nIn 1654, Hals had to appear before a public notary of Haarlem at the\r\ninstance of his landlord, who sued him for debt. The great Dutch\r\npainter in his testimony affirmed that his only possessions were two\r\npictures by Vermander and Van Heemskerck, and three by himself and one\r\nof his sons, as well as three mattresses and bolsters, a cupboard and a\r\ntable! The Louvre exhibits no pictorial record of Hals’s latest phase,\r\nwhen he was deserted by his friends, neglected by art patrons, and no\r\nlonger possessed any inner moral support.\r\n\r\nThe colouring of his early portraits is vigorous, the tone deep,\r\nand the execution careful; gradually he employs richer colouring,\r\nsubordinates the local colours, and becomes broader in treatment. From\r\nabout 1650 his olive-greens gradually take on a more ash-grey hue,\r\nuntil we are inclined to the belief that if the master had been\r\nable to dispense with colour altogether, he would have willingly done\r\nso. It is then that the colours on his palette, like the outer world,\r\nbecame grey and black for him.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                       PLATE XXVIII.—FRANS HALS\r\n\r\n                             (1580?-1666)\r\n\r\n                             DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n             No. 2385.—PORTRAIT OF A LADY IN A BLACK DRESS\r\n\r\n                          (Portrait de Femme)\r\n\r\n  A middle-aged woman wearing a black dress, with white collar, cuffs\r\n  and cap, is seen at three-quarter length, standing and turned\r\n  three-quarters to the left; in her hands, which are superposed, she\r\n  holds her gloves.\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on canvas.\r\n\r\n  3 ft. 3½ in. × 2 ft. 7½ in. (1·00 × 0·80.)]\r\n\r\nThis great master of the brush some time before his death had to avail\r\nhimself of poor relief granted by the municipality of Haarlem, and\r\nafter his death, in 1666, his widow received an allowance of fourteen\r\nsous a week! Such was the tragic end of one of the most accomplished of\r\nportrait painters in the whole range of art.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DUTCH INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nHolland after a terrible struggle had ultimately succeeded in throwing\r\noff the Spanish yoke before the art of Hals was on the wane. Dutch\r\nart then became gradually more independent, self-centred, democratic\r\nin outlook, and Protestant in tendency. Religious subjects became\r\nless frequent, and domestic scenes dealing with indoor and outdoor\r\nlife were before long largely on the increase. Before we pass to the\r\ndetailed study of the most striking characteristics of art in Holland\r\nin the last half of the seventeenth century, we must examine at some\r\nlength the far-reaching influence and the world-famous achievements of\r\nRembrandt, for whom Hals may be said to have prepared the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               REMBRANDT\r\n\r\nAs his name denotes, Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn (1606-1669) was born\r\non the banks of the Rhine, his father being a miller at Leyden. When\r\nfourteen years of age he entered the university of his native town and\r\nhad a classical education, which stood him in good stead through his\r\nlong and troubled career. Although he was at first placed as a pupil\r\nof Jacob van Swanenburgh, he at an early age removed to Amsterdam.\r\nThere he worked under Pieter Lastman (1583-1633), whose _Abraham’s\r\nSacrificing Jacob_ (No. 2443A) of 1616 is hung opposite the works\r\nof his illustrious pupil. The independent spirit of Rembrandt soon\r\nasserted itself, and as early as 1627 he placed his name on pictures\r\nwhich still exist, notably in the Berlin and Stuttgart museums. His\r\nearliest picture in the Louvre is the _Old Man Reading_ (No. 2541A),\r\nwhich is signed and dated 1630, and was presented by M. Kaempfen, a\r\nformer Director of this gallery, on his retirement. Three years later\r\ncame the two small and very similar versions (No. 2540 and No. 2541)\r\nof the _Philosopher in Meditation_, the former of which is signed and\r\ndated; in 1633 was painted the _Portrait of the Artist_ (No. 2552),\r\nwhile another oval picture of the same subject (No. 2553) is inscribed\r\n1634. In this early period the artist was in the habit of portraying\r\nmembers of his own family, who were naturally his most accessible\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nAt this moment of his career Rembrandt had to measure himself with\r\nmany rivals in Amsterdam, notably with Thomas de Keyser (1596?-1667),\r\nwhose _Portrait of a Man_ (No. 2438A) was formerly in the Rodolphe\r\nKann collection, while a half-length _Portrait of a Man_ (No. 2438B),\r\nalso by de Keyser, was formerly at Versailles. From the trammels\r\nand restrictions which the art of de Keyser would have been likely\r\nto impose on a less gifted and original mind, Rembrandt readily set\r\nhimself free; and he must have had great hopes for the future when, in\r\n1634, he took to wife the wealthy Saskia van Uylenborch. However, the\r\noval _Portrait of Himself wearing a black cap_ (No. 2554), dated 1637,\r\nis of marked inferiority to the dignified and deeply religious panel,\r\n_The Archangel Raphael leaving Tobias and his Father Tobit_ (No. 2536),\r\nof the same year. A year later he must have painted the _Portrait of an\r\nOld Man_ (No. 2544), and his first pure landscape.\r\n\r\nThe influence of domestic bereavements on Rembrandt’s art is\r\nclearly reflected in the choice of his subjects, in their more\r\nintimate setting, and in the deep feeling which evidently inspired\r\nthem. No better example of this side of his character and his art could\r\nbe found than the _Holy Family in the Carpenter’s Shop_ (No. 2542),\r\nwhich he painted in 1640. In that year his mother died, an event which\r\nfollowed rapidly on the death of his two infant daughters and his son,\r\nand his wife’s frequent illness. He, however, still went on painting\r\nsuch varied compositions as the _Portrait of a Man_ (No. 2546), of\r\n1645, and the _Woman Bathing_ (No. 2550), which he achieved two years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                         PLATE XXIX.—REMBRANDT\r\n\r\n                              (1606-1669)\r\n\r\n                             DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                   No. 2539.—THE PILGRIMS AT EMMAUS\r\n\r\n                        (Les Pèlerins d’Emmaüs)\r\n\r\n  In a lofty room in front of a shallow niche in a wall, Christ and\r\n  the two disciples sit at table; a young serving-man enters from the\r\n  right, carrying a dish.

(0·68 × 0·65.)]\r\n\r\nThe famous _Night-Watch_, in the Amsterdam Gallery, testifies to his\r\ninventive faculty in 1642, the year in which the death of his beloved\r\nSaskia caused him intense grief. From this he never really recovered,\r\nas we see from the frequency with which during the remainder of his\r\nlife he painted pathetic subjects. What artist in the whole history\r\nof painting has been able to impart to his rendering of the _Good\r\nSamaritan_ the kindly solicitude of the principal character in this\r\nparable, and the feeling of complete collapse seen in the body of the\r\nwounded man, as Rembrandt has done in his superb canvas (No. 2537) of\r\n1648 in this gallery? No less poignant is the grief depicted on the\r\nface of the barefooted Man of Sorrows in the _Christ and the Pilgrims\r\nat Emmaus_ (No. 2539, Plate XXIX.) of the same year. Here we see\r\nconvincing proof of the dexterous use that the Dutch “magician-painter”\r\ncould make of chiaroscuro, which he has handled with such masterly\r\neffect in the _Portrait of Hendrickje Stoffels_ (No. 2547, Plate XXX.).\r\nAll these paintings belong to the same period as the soul-moving\r\n_Polish Rider_, which in 1910 passed from the collection of Count\r\nTarnowski at Dzikow in Galicia into that of Mr. H. C. Frick in New\r\nYork for £60,000. The _Portrait of a Man holding a Bâton_ (No. 2551),\r\nin the La Caze collection in this gallery, was painted three years\r\nlater than the _Bathsheba_, or _Woman Bathing_ (No. 2549), of 1654.\r\nThe wonderfully realistic and in no way repellent _Carcase of an Ox_\r\nin this gallery (No. 2548), like the picture of the same subject at\r\nGlasgow, is an achievement of a very different kind, and belongs to the\r\nyear 1655.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre authorities have been well advised in recent years in\r\nhanging all the pictures by Rembrandt in this collection in one Bay of\r\nthe Long Gallery. Here now we may study the _Portrait of a Young Man_\r\n(No. 2545), the wonderful and rather later _Portrait of the Artist at\r\nhis Easel at the age of Fifty-four_ (No. 2555), and the striking _St.\r\nMatthew_ (No. 2538) of 1661. Before these three works were painted, the\r\ngreat Dutch master had been declared bankrupt, the sale of his most\r\ntreasured possessions realising a ridiculously small sum in the winter\r\nof 1657.\r\n\r\nAlthough Rembrandt’s own standard of morality offended his neighbours,\r\nand his relations with Hendrickje Stoffels seem to have caused much\r\nscandal in Amsterdam, we are not concerned with the morals of one of\r\nthe greatest and most esteemed of the world’s painters, but only with\r\nhis _œuvre_, a high place in which must be accorded to the _Portrait of\r\nHendrickje Stoffels and her Child as Venus and Cupid_ (No. 2543), which\r\nwas painted in 1662, the year that the large _Syndics_, now in the\r\nAmsterdam Gallery, was completed.\r\n\r\nHe is also to be credited with the alternative version of the _Pilgrims\r\nat Emmaus_ (No. 2555A), a painting of the same date, which for many\r\nyears was at Compiègne, where, however, it passed only as a school\r\npicture. This profoundly creative painter, who learnt as time went on\r\nto handle his chiaroscuro with increased effect, was also an etcher of\r\nthe highest order.\r\n\r\nWe may here note that the art of Jan Lievens (1607-1674), a\r\nfellow-pupil with Rembrandt under Pieter Lastman, is seen in the large\r\nbut far from imposing _Visitation_ (No. 2444).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                         PLATE XXX.—REMBRANDT\r\n\r\n                              (1606-1669)\r\n\r\n                             DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n               No. 2547.—PORTRAIT OF HENDRICKJE STOFFELS\r\n\r\n                   (Portrait de Hendrickje Stoffels)\r\n\r\n  She is seated, and looks at the spectator.

(0·72 × 0·60.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE PUPILS OF REMBRANDT\r\n\r\nThat Govaert Flinck (1615-1660) was a pupil of Rembrandt, is evident\r\nfrom his _Announcement to the Shepherds_ (No. 2372) rather than from\r\nhis _Portrait of a Young Lady_ (No. 2373), a signed work of 1641.\r\nFerdinand Bol (1617-1680) was a pupil and imitator of the great Dutch\r\nmaster, and his _Portrait of a Mathematician_ (No. 2330) is one of his\r\nbest paintings; but his _Philosopher in Meditation_ (No. 2328) compares\r\nmost unfavourably with Rembrandt’s two early pictures of the same\r\nsubject which hang opposite it.\r\n\r\nThe ineffectual productions of Jan Victoors (1620-1670) include the\r\n_Portrait of a Young Lady_ (No. 2371), a typical example of the “niche”\r\nportrait which became so popular, and a large _Isaac blessing Jacob_\r\n(No. 2370), which vividly recalls his small canvas in the Dulwich\r\nCollege Gallery that in less critical days passed as a Rembrandt.\r\n\r\nG. van den Eeckhout (1621-1674) in his picture (No. 2364) shows his\r\ndependence on Rembrandt; and Cornells Drost’s repulsive _Bathsheba_\r\n(No. 2359A) has no claim to be regarded as a “_fort bonne peinture_,”\r\nas a French critic has thought fit to term it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VAN DER HELST\r\n\r\nBartholomeus van der Heist (1612-1670), a native of Haarlem, who\r\npainted under the early Dutch master, Nicholas Elias, surnamed\r\nPickenoy, and subsequently worked at Amsterdam, has fully signed his\r\n_Shooting Prize_ (No. 2394, Plate XXXI.), which is dated 1653. It has\r\nbeen regarded as a replica on a very reduced scale of _The Officers\r\nof the Brotherhood of St. Sebastian at Amsterdam_, in the Amsterdam\r\nGallery, which, curiously enough, bears the date 1657, and is also\r\nsigned on a slate.\r\n\r\nPieter van der Faes, who is better known as Sir Peter Lely\r\n(1618-1680), after painting at Haarlem in the school of Pieter de\r\nGrebber, went to England in 1641. He there succeeded Van Dyck as Court\r\npainter, and at the Restoration became the favourite Royal painter. The\r\naffectation and mannerism of his _Windsor Beauties_, now at Hampton\r\nCourt, is well known. He had a certain facility in painting\r\n\r\n  “The sleepy eye that spoke the melting soul.”\r\n\r\nThree pictures (Nos. 2367-2369) are placed to his credit here, but\r\n\r\n  “The bugle eyeball and the cheek of cream”\r\n\r\nhave done their magic now.\r\n\r\nThe name of H. van Vliet (1611?-1675) is, doubtless, correctly\r\nconnected with two portraits on canvas (Nos. 2605 and 2605A), while his\r\ncontemporaries, Cornelis Saftleven (1606-1681) and D. van Santvoort\r\n(1610-1680), are represented by _The Artist’s Portrait_ (No. 2562)\r\nand the _Pilgrims at Emmaus_ (No. 2564) respectively. Jakob van Loo\r\n(1614-1670), who became a naturalised Frenchman, may be judged by his\r\ndiploma picture (No. 2451) and a very poor _Nude Female_ (No. 2452).\r\n\r\nSuch mediocre producers of uninspired and unconvincing panels as Dirk\r\nHals (1591-1656), the brother and pupil of Frans Hals, whose _Festive\r\nRepast_ (No. 2389) hangs in Room XXIII.; Cornelis van Poelenburg\r\n(1586-1667), whose art is here admirably illustrated (Nos. 2518-2523);\r\nHendrick Pot (1585-1657), who evidently derived some satisfaction from\r\nthe elaborate inscription he has placed on his quite ineffectual, but\r\nfortunately diminutive, _Portrait of Charles I._ (No. 2525); and the\r\nlittle-known and less-esteemed L. F. Zustris (1526-1600), whose absurd\r\n_Venus and Love_ (No. 2640) shows what a waste of time it was for him\r\nto study under Titian in Italy—these and many more worked as “business\r\nartists” for undiscriminating patrons. In the same category come\r\nAdriaen van de Venne (No. 2601), Pieter Codde (No. 2339A), Jacob\r\nDuck (No. 2360-2361), and A. Palamedesz (No. 2515A).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                       PLATE XXXI.—VAN DER HELST\r\n\r\n                              (1613-1670)\r\n\r\n                             DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                     No. 2394.—THE SHOOTING PRIZE\r\n\r\n               (Les Chefs de la Gilde des arbalétriers)\r\n\r\n  The four officers of the Brotherhood of St. Sebastian at Amsterdam\r\n  are seated at a table in the foreground, with the insignia of the\r\n  Brotherhood displayed before them.

(0·50 × 0·67.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GENRE PAINTERS\r\n\r\nThis rough sketch must suffice for our study of the History and\r\nPortrait Painters of Holland. Although, of course, portraiture played\r\na most important part throughout the whole range of Dutch art, we must\r\nnow deal with those of their contemporaries and successors who are\r\nclassed as painters of genre subjects, Interiors, Conversation-pieces,\r\nand Rustic Scenes. The compositions of these men at first show high\r\ntechnical excellence, and a refined feeling for light and shade;\r\nthey depict simple scenes and homely incidents which make a wide\r\nappeal in any age. By the end of the seventeenth century their scenes\r\nbecome festive, and eventually boisterous, and so degenerate into\r\nunimaginative renderings of far-fetched incidents which are treated\r\nwith a parade of mere imitative skill. In the last phase of their art\r\nthe subjects become even more uninviting, the panels are smoothly\r\npainted, and all originality disappears.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ADRIAEN VAN OSTADE\r\n\r\nAdriaen van Ostade (1610-1685), as a pupil of Frans Hals at Haarlem,\r\noccupies an important position in his school. He is seen to very great\r\nadvantage at the Louvre. From his early _Interior of a Cabaret_ (No.\r\n2506), which is signed on a form\r\n\r\n                         “A. V. OSTADE 1641,”\r\n\r\nwe see the direction his life’s work was to take; and his _Interior of\r\na Cottage_ (No. 2498) of the following year, strengthens that view.\r\nAlthough _Reading the Gazette_ (No. 2505), of 1653, is painted on\r\na very small panel, it heightens our appreciation of this able and\r\ncareful painter, who, a year later, must have spent a long time in\r\nthe completion of a _Family Group_, which traditionally passes as the\r\n_Family of the Artist_ (No. 2495). The _Toper_ (No. 2401), of 1668, and\r\nthe intensely realistic _Smoker_ (No. 2500), are highly characteristic,\r\nwhile the _Schoolmaster_ (No. 2496) shows great observation. The _Fish\r\nMarket_ (No. 2497), the _Business Man in his Study_ (No. 2499), the\r\n_Man Drinking_ (No. 2502), the _Man Reading_ (No. 2503), the _Reading_\r\n(No. 2504), and the _Interior of a School_ (No. 2507), are both in\r\nsubject and handling good examples of his methods, which were affected\r\nby a study of Adriaen Brouwer and Rembrandt.\r\n\r\nAdriaen van Ostade was the elder brother and the master of Isack van\r\nOstade (1621-1649), who is equally well represented at the Louvre.\r\nAlthough he painted two _Interiors_ (Nos. 2512 and 2514), a _Toit à\r\nporcs_ (No. 2513), a _Halt_ (No. 2509), and an overcrowded _Travellers\r\nHalting_ (No. 2508), his best works, here as elsewhere, represent\r\nlandscapes and frozen river scenes.\r\n\r\nAdriaen van Ostade had also as pupils Cornelis Bega (1620-1664), by\r\nwhom the Louvre possesses a very late _Rustic Interior_ (No. 2312), of\r\n1662; and H. M. Sorgh, called Rokes (1611?-1670), three of whose panels\r\n(Nos. 2571-2573) are exhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GERARD DOU\r\n\r\nGerard Dou (1613-1675) was in his day a highly popular and prosperous\r\npainter of petty tragedies. As a boy of fifteen he entered the studio\r\nof “the skilled and far-famed Mr. Rembrandt,” who was, however, his\r\nsenior by only seven years. One is apt to tire of his irritating\r\nparade of cleverness in the manipulation of light and shade effects,\r\nand over-scrupulous and niggling treatment of detail. Yet it is these\r\nvery qualities that brought him financial success when in later life\r\nRembrandt was receiving scanty treatment at the hands of the art\r\npatrons of Holland. The _Dentist_ (No. 2355) is an early work. Dou’s\r\n_Portrait of an Old Lady_ (No. 2358) is now held to be a _Portrait of\r\nRembrandt’s Mother_, and is regarded as the companion picture to the\r\n_Old Man Reading_ (No. 2567), by Dou’s pupil, Godfried Schalcken. The\r\n_Grocer’s Shop_ (No. 2350), which has been, with needless precision,\r\n“ranked about the seventh best of this master’s productions,” is signed\r\nin full on the slate, and dated 1647 on the mortar, while the _Cook\r\nwith a Dead Cock_ (No. 2353) is signed on the window-sill, and dated\r\n1650.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                        PLATE XXXII.—GERARD DOU\r\n\r\n                              (1613-1675)\r\n\r\n                             DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                     No. 2348.—THE DROPSICAL WOMAN\r\n\r\n                         (La Femme Hydropique)\r\n\r\n  In a well-appointed room, lighted by an arched window on the left,\r\n  an old woman is seated in an arm-chair. The sick woman, who raises\r\n  her eyes to heaven and is taking a spoonful of medicine from a\r\n  young woman, gives her right hand to a girl who kneels on the left\r\n  by her side. Towards the right stands the doctor, who holds up to\r\n  the light a glass full of liquid. A chandelier hangs in the centre,\r\n  and on the right are a large tapestry curtain and a wine-cooler.\r\n\r\n  Signed on the edge of the book placed on the reading-desk in the\r\n  left foreground:—\r\n\r\n  “1663. G. DOV. OVT. 65 JAER.”\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on panel.\r\n\r\n  2 ft. 8¾ in. × 2 ft. 2½ in. (0·83 × 0·67.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Trumpeter_ (No. 2351) is perhaps the pendant to the _Girl at a\r\nWindow_, of 1657, now in the Rothschild collection at Waddesdon Manor.\r\nOn the window-ledge in the _Trumpeter_ we see the same silver flagon\r\nand a dish that also appear in the _Dropsical Woman_ (No. 2348, Plate\r\nXXXII.), a world-famous, but not on that account a great, picture. It\r\nbears a somewhat enigmatical inscription:\r\n\r\n                     “1663. G. DOV. OVT. 65 JAER”\r\n\r\non the edge of the book placed on the reading-desk. Dou in 1663, the\r\nyear here given, was only fifty years of age, and the statement of\r\nage in the second half of the inscription may be a later addition, or\r\ncapable of another interpretation. The light comes in from the window\r\non the left. The woman who is dying of dropsy is receiving a dose of\r\nmedicine, while her daughter in grief kneels and kisses her hand, and\r\nthe doctor holds up to the light the vial, the contents of which he\r\nis carefully examining. The artist in this his largest picture is at\r\nmuch pains to show the dexterity with which he can paint the fabric\r\nof the dresses, the large tapestry hanging in folds on the right,\r\nand the reflection of light on the chandelier. This panel, which is\r\nDou’s masterpiece and is in an excellent state of preservation, was\r\noriginally contained in an ebony case, the outside of which (in two\r\npieces) was formerly the still-life painting of a _Silver Ewer and\r\nDish_ (No. 2349).\r\n\r\nThe _Man weighing Gold_ (No. 2354) is signed in full, and dated 1664;\r\nelaborate care and much time have been expended, if not wasted, on\r\nevery wrinkle in his face, and every hair in his white beard. It\r\nhas points of analogy with Quentin Matsys’s _Banker and his Wife_\r\n(No. 2029), which was painted in Flanders nearly a century and a\r\nhalf earlier. Dou’s meticulous art is also exemplified in the _Old\r\nMan Reading_ (No. 2357), _Reading the Bible_ (No. 2356), the _Dutch\r\nCook_ (No. 2352), and the highly characteristic but quite negligible\r\n_Portrait of the Painter_ (No. 2359). In many respects this type of\r\npicture warns us that within a few years of Dou’s death, in 1675, the\r\nart of Holland passed into decadence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DOU’S PUPILS\r\n\r\nHe had several pupils. Of these Quiryn van Brekelenkam (1620?-1668)\r\nholds a respectable place among the Small Masters of Holland, as we\r\nsee from his _Consultation_ (No. 2337) in this collection rather than\r\nfrom his _Monk Writing_ (No. 2338). Herman van Swanevelt (1620-1655),\r\nwho from his journeys south earned the name of Herman of Italy, gives\r\nus three _Landscapes_ (Nos. 2584-2586). Karel de Moor (1656-1738),\r\na native of Leyden, who has signed his _Dutch Family_ (No. 2477),\r\nworked under both Dou and Frans van Mieris the Elder (1635-1681). The\r\nlatter owes much of his technique and meticulous work to Dou, as is\r\nrevealed by a hasty inspection of his _Tea Party_ (No. 2471), with two\r\nover-dressed women taking tea, and three other panels (Nos. 2469, 2470,\r\nand 2472). Ary de Vois (1632-1680) was a pupil of the German painter N.\r\nKnupfer and of his own countryman Abraham van den Tempel (1622-1672),\r\nwho is here represented by a _Portrait of a Lady with an Apple_ (No.\r\n2586A); but he also came under the influence of the painter of the\r\n_Dropsical Woman_ (Plate XXXII.), as is testified by his small interior\r\n_Portrait of a Man_ (No. 2606), his _Portrait of a Painter at his\r\nEasel_ (No. 2607), and his feeble _Woman cutting a Lemon_ (No. 2608).\r\nTraces of Dou’s art are seen in J. A. van Staveren’s (1624?-1668)\r\n_Philosopher in his Study_ (No. 2577); but P. C. van Slingelandt\r\n(1640-1691) was a direct pupil. His _Dutch Family_ (No. 2568) is said\r\nto have been bought by Louis XVI. from an English brewer, and the\r\n_Portrait of a Man_ (No. 2569) and _Kitchen Utensils_ (No. 2570) have\r\nlong been in the collection. The _Magdalene_ (No. 2570A) and _St.\r\nJerome_ (No. 2570B) were bequeathed to the Louvre.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                        PLATE XXXIII.—TERBORCH\r\n\r\n                              (1617-1681)\r\n\r\n                             DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                         No. 2589.—THE CONCERT\r\n\r\n                             (Le Concert)\r\n\r\n  A young lady in white satin dress and yellow bodice is seated\r\n  in the centre before a table covered with a richly coloured\r\n  tablecloth.

Terborch invites us to join him in the fine\r\ndecorum of a noble chamber where the appointments are carefully tended,\r\nwhile its occupants give themselves up to cultured, if not perhaps\r\ndeeply intellectual, pursuits. We forget all about the carousing and\r\nbestial profligates who people the taverns of Jan Steen and much\r\nless accomplished painters, and watch the refined fingers stray over\r\nthe keyboard of the open spinet or sweep the strings of a well-made\r\nmandoline, as in the _Concert_ (No. 2589, Plate XXXIII.). Equally fine\r\nare the two _Music Lessons_ (No. 2588 and No. 2591), the former being\r\nsigned and dated 1660.\r\n\r\nThe _Military Galant_ (No. 2587) exhibits Terborch’s dexterity in the\r\nrendering of reflected light on a red tablecloth, although the subject\r\nhas an innuendo which hardly adds to its charm. The _Ecclesiastical\r\nAssembly_ (No. 2590) is only a small sketch on panel, and affords but\r\na feeble echo of this painter’s masterpiece, the _Ratification of the\r\nPeace of Münster_, in the National Gallery. Terborch was a pupil of\r\nhis father, who had visited Italy, and he studied also under Pieter\r\nMolyn the Elder at Haarlem previous to visiting England in 1635. He\r\ntravelled much more extensively than most of his contemporaries, and\r\nwent to Spain during the best period of art in the Peninsula. He does\r\nnot seem to have been dependent on his professional success for his\r\nliving, which was passed in easy circumstances. Nor did he busy himself\r\nas a teacher, his only direct pupil being Caspar Netscher (1639-1684),\r\nwho gives us a _Music Lesson_ (No. 2486), of the approved stamp, and a\r\n_Violoncello Lesson_ (No. 2487).\r\n\r\n\r\n                               JAN STEEN\r\n\r\nIt is not known for certain whether Jan Steen (1626?-1679) was a pupil\r\nof Nicholaes Knupfer, a native of Leipzig who resided for a time at\r\nLeyden, but he certainly worked under Adriaen van Ostade at Haarlem,\r\nand later became a pupil of Jan van Goyen, whose daughter Margaretha\r\nhe married as his first wife. Steen certainly leased a brewery in\r\nDelft for six years, and he is frequently mentioned in the archives of\r\nthat town about 1656; he subsequently kept a tavern in the Langebrug\r\nin Leyden in 1672. His art is vivacious if not boisterous, and the\r\nstrength and versatility he displayed in the nine hundred pictures with\r\nwhich he is justly credited give him a high place among the artists of\r\nHolland in the seventeenth century. The frequency with which he painted\r\nthe _Interior of a Tavern_ (No. 2578) has suggested that he carried\r\non the tradition of the Flemish-Dutch roysterer Adriaen Brouwer; but\r\nsuch scenes, magnificently as they are handled, are apt to become\r\nboring in time. This large canvas is dated 1674, and the coat of arms\r\nof Charles V. is fastened on to the balcony in which are spectators.\r\nThe _Merry Company at Table_ (No. 2579) is somewhat sketchy in parts,\r\nbut the lighting is well regulated, and the canvas is signed in full\r\non the back of a blue-covered chair to the right. That the _Bad\r\nCompany_ (No. 2580, Plate XXXIV.) is admirably painted will be conceded\r\nby all, but refinement is not its distinguishing feature. A young\r\nman dressed in a red jacket is sleeping with his head on the lap of\r\na girl, while another girl is relieving him of his watch. The scene\r\nis laid in a tavern, on the floor of which are painted with wonderful\r\nprecision a number of tiny objects. It was not Steen’s habit to paint\r\nrepresentations of cultured society such as Terborch delighted in.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                        PLATE XXXIV.—JAN STEEN\r\n\r\n                             (1626?-1679)\r\n\r\n                             DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                         No. 2580.—BAD COMPANY\r\n\r\n                        (La Mauvaise compagnie)\r\n\r\n  The scene takes place in a tavern.

He also lived at Delft and Leyden. The _Interior\r\nof a Dutch House, with a Woman preparing Vegetables_ (No. 2414), is\r\na good example, and is fully signed in the bottom left-hand corner.\r\nThe _Dutch Interior, with a Lady playing Cards_ (No. 2415, Plate\r\nXXXV.), is full of incidents, contains six figures, and is signed\r\non the base of one of the columns supporting the mantelpiece in the\r\nleft foreground. No museum in the world exhibits the art of Pieter de\r\nHooch in such excellence as does the National Gallery, which contains\r\nthree masterpieces from his hands that have indirectly been the cause\r\nof assessing the whole of the artist’s life-work on too generous a\r\nbasis. It is indisputable that during the last ten years of his life,\r\nof which nothing is known later than the signature and date, 1677,\r\non the _Music Party_ in the collection of Baron H. A. Steengracht at\r\nThe Hague, his art deteriorated very considerably both in colouring\r\nand draughtsmanship. He may well have been a pupil of Karel Fabritius\r\n(1624-1654), but it is almost incredible that he can have been a pupil\r\nof the Italianiser Nicholaes Berchem, as Houbraken ventured to assert.\r\nThis museum contains nothing by Ochtervelt, many of whose pictures have\r\nfrom time to time been accepted as the work of Pieter de Hooch.\r\n\r\nFrom the shortlived artist Karel Fabritius derives the almost\r\nincomparable master Jan Vermeer van Delft (1642-1675), whose fifty\r\nauthentic pictures are to-day among those most coveted by collectors.\r\nAs a _painter_ skilled in the technicalities of his profession Vermeer\r\nmust be accorded the highest rank. The subtle and mysterious handling\r\nof his _Lace Maker_ (No. 2456, Plate XXXVI.), with its cool colour\r\nscheme and dominant tones of blue and lemon-yellow, make it difficult\r\nfor us to realise that until twenty years ago his works were neglected.\r\nIndeed, this small canvas was acquired in 1870 at the Vis Blokhuyzen\r\nsale for the ridiculous sum of £290. Jan Vermeer (or Van der Meer)\r\nvan Delft is not to be confused with Jan Van der Meer of Haarlem\r\n(1628-1691), who is included in the official catalogue as the painter\r\nof the _Outside of an Inn_ (No. 2455, marked No. 2022 on the frame). It\r\nis fully signed, and bears the date 1652.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NICOLAS MAES\r\n\r\nOne of the last lingering influences of Rembrandt is seen in the\r\nart of Nicolas Maes (1632-1693). The genre pictures of his early\r\nperiod are so vastly superior to his later portraits that it was\r\nformerly assumed that there might well have been two artists of the\r\nsame name. He certainly delighted in painting several versions,\r\nwhich vary considerably in size, of _Grace before Meat_ (No. 2454).\r\nIn his pictures we see the mind that broods, and women who meditate\r\nrather than act. The best examples of his domestic scenes are finely\r\ngraduated, although the sadness of advancing age becomes monotonous in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                      PLATE XXXV.—PIETER DE HOOCH\r\n\r\n                             (1629-1677?)\r\n\r\n                             DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n          No. 2415.—DUTCH INTERIOR WITH A LADY PLAYING CARDS\r\n\r\n                        (Intérieur hollandais)\r\n\r\n  By the fireplace to the left a lady is seated.

(0·67 × 0·77.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GABRIEL METSU\r\n\r\nA high place among the painters of “Conversation-pieces” must be\r\naccorded to Gabriel Metsu (1630?-1667), a shortlived artist who was\r\nborn at Leyden and learnt the first principles of his art from Dou. As\r\nearly as 1644 he seems to have earned some reputation as a painter,\r\nhis signature appearing on his _Court Physician_ in that year. He came\r\nunder the influence of Rembrandt, and in later life practised as a\r\npainter at Amsterdam, where he died.\r\n\r\nMetsu, whose work is at first sight not easily distinguishable from\r\nTerborch’s, acquired a facility in the control of the expression and\r\nthe ever-varying gesture of the hands in his pictures, that was denied\r\nto many of his contemporaries. Instances of this are the figure of the\r\nChrist writing a long Latin inscription on the ground in the _Woman\r\ntaken in Adultery_ (No. 2457), the ease with which the young lady in\r\na white satin dress runs her fingers over the keys of the spinet in\r\nthe _Music Lesson_ (No. 2460), and the treatment of the _Dutch Lady_\r\n(No. 2462), who holds a jug in her right hand. The last-named panel is\r\nevidently the companion to the very thinly painted _Dutch Cook peeling\r\nApples_ (No. 2463), which is signed “G. METSU.” Perhaps his best\r\noutdoor scene of humble life is the _Vegetable Market at Amsterdam_\r\n(No. 2458), although his handling of the trees suggests that his forte\r\nwas the Conversation-piece of Dutch tradition, and that he would not\r\nhave risen to high rank as a landscape painter. The placing of the\r\nsignature on a letter, which in this instance lies on the ground, is\r\na favourite device with Metsu. He has derived much pleasure from the\r\ntreatment of the textures of the tablecloth, the curtain, and the chair\r\nin the _Officer visiting a Lady_ (No. 2459). The _Alchemist_ (No. 2461)\r\nmay be the companion picture to the _Sportsman_ in the Gallery at The\r\nHague. Much speculative criticism has been indulged in by critics as\r\nto whether the so-called _Portrait of Admiral Cornelis Tromp_ (No.\r\n2464) represents that admiral, and some doubt has also been cast on its\r\nattribution to Metsu.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LANDSCAPE PAINTERS\r\n\r\nThe naturalistic treatment of the landscape background in the religious\r\npictures of Jan van Eyck and his successors, Memlinc, Bouts, Hugo van\r\nder Goes, and other painters in the Netherlands, in time brought about\r\nthe promotion of landscape painting to an independent art. Among the\r\nearlier Dutch artists who approached the study of Nature were Arent\r\nArentzen (1586?-1635?), as we see from his _Landscape with a Fisherman_\r\n(No. 2300A), and Roeland Roghman, who was born a year later than Jan\r\nvan Goyen, and lived as late as 1685. He painted the _Landscape_ (No.\r\n2555B), which was formerly in the Paul Mantz collection. Indeed,\r\nseveral Dutchmen of the period sought to commit to panel views of\r\nnature, as in the case of Pieter de Bloot (1600-1652), who gives us a\r\n_Landscape with a River_ (No. 2327B).\r\n\r\nThe romantic feeling which so often pervades the background of\r\nRembrandt’s paintings, and is so apparent in such etchings as the\r\n_Three Trees_, can only be touched on here. This new tendency is best\r\nexemplified in the works of Jan van Goyen (1596-1656), who may be\r\nregarded as the founder of a self-centred school of landscape painting\r\nin Holland; but it was his ever handy sketch-book that enabled him to\r\noutstrip his rivals in this branch of Dutch art. He is seen to great\r\nadvantage in his very fine _Banks of a Dutch River_ (No. 2375), his\r\nsuperb _River View with eight Men in a Boat_ (No. 2378), a signed and\r\ndated work of 1649, a large light-brown-toned _River in Holland_ (No.\r\n2377), a good _Banks of a Canal_ (No. 2379), as well as a _Dutch Canal_\r\n(No. 2376) and a _Dutch River_ (No. 2377).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                  PLATE XXXVI.—JAN VER MEER VAN DELFT\r\n\r\n                              (1632-1675)\r\n\r\n                             DUTCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                       No. 2456.—THE LACE MAKER\r\n\r\n                           (La Dentellière)\r\n\r\n  A girl, wearing a yellow bodice and a blue skirt, is seated behind\r\n  a table.

Herman Saftleven’s (1609-1685) _Banks of the Rhine_ (No.\r\n2563); Jan Asselyn’s _View of the Lamentano Bridge on the Teverone_\r\n(No. 2301), _Landscape_ (No. 2302), and _Ruins in the Roman Campagna_\r\n(No. 2303); and the two _Landscapes_ (Nos. 2332 and 2333) by Jan Both\r\n(1610-1652), who worked in Rome and painted Italian landscapes under\r\nthe influence of the French artist Claude Lorrain, show the gradual\r\nintroduction of foreign influences. Joris van der Hagen (died 1669)\r\ntakes a new line in the representation of a very low horizon in his\r\n_Environs de Haarlem_ (No. 2382); but his _Landscape with Peasants\r\ncrossing a Ford_ (No. 2381) is dull in tone and composed of unrelated\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThe _Banks of a River_ (No. 2561D) is a superb example of the art of\r\nSalomon van Ruysdael (1600?-1670), one of the founders of the Haarlem\r\nschool of landscape, and the uncle of Jacob van Ruisdael. The _Large\r\nTower_ (No. 2561C) gives a better idea of his power than the _Ford_\r\n(No. 2561B). Another painter in the same school, Cornelis Decker\r\n(1618?-1678), has a _Landscape_ (No. 2346). Although Isack van Ostade\r\nat times gave himself up to trivial subjects, as we have already\r\nseen, the merit of his frozen river scenes (Nos. 2510, 2511, 2515) is\r\nfirmly established, and the happy way in which he combined a genuine\r\nappreciation of nature with great skill in the placing and treatment of\r\nhis figures has earned for him a high place among the Dutch landscape\r\npainters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AELBERT CUYP\r\n\r\nUnlike most of the artists of his time in Holland, Aelbert Cuyp\r\n(1620-1691) was highly esteemed by his contemporaries, his social\r\nposition and his good fortune in money matters freeing him from the\r\npoverty which Hobbema and others endured. He painted portraits with\r\nmuch skill, as we see from his _Portrait of a Man_ (No. 2345A) and his\r\n_Portrait of a Boy and a Girl with a Goat_ (No. 2344); but he is best\r\nknown as a cattle painter, his sturdy cattle being artistically grouped\r\nin thick green pastures flooded with sunshine, as in his _Herdsman\r\nwith Cattle_ (No. 2341). He attained much success also with his riding\r\npictures, and the _Starting for the Ride_ (No. 2342) and the _Riding\r\nParty_ (No. 2343) are in every way preferable to his _Boats on a Rough\r\nSea_ (No. 2345). Following his usual habit, he has placed no date on\r\nany of these six pictures. He had no pupil in the proper sense of the\r\nterm; but a host of imitators, such as Jacob van Stry and the much\r\nlater English Royal Academician Sidney Cooper, failed ignominiously in\r\ntheir feeble attempts to copy his methods.\r\n\r\nJan Wynants was another landscape painter in the Haarlem School,\r\nalthough he settled in Amsterdam and died there in 1682. His _Outskirts\r\nof a Forest_ (No. 2636) is signed and dated 1668, and is superior to\r\nthe _Landscape_ (No. 2637) which bears his own signature as well as\r\nthat of Adriaen van de Velde, who on numerous occasions inserted the\r\nfigures for him. Wynants has also placed his name on a small _Landscape\r\nwith Sportsman and Falconer_ (No. 2638).\r\n\r\nAdriaen van de Velde has been careful to sign and date each of the\r\nseven pictures by which he is represented (Nos. 2593-2599). By Allart\r\nvan Everdingen (1621-1675), who travelled in Norway and painted rocky\r\nscenes and waterfalls, we find two _Landscapes_ (Nos. 2365 and 2366).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JACOB VAN RUISDAEL\r\n\r\nThe greatest of all Dutch landscape painters, with the possible\r\nexception of Jan van Goyen, is Jacob van Ruisdael (1628?-1682), who\r\noccupied himself more especially with rushing waterfalls and undulating\r\ncountry. His _Storm on the Coast_ (No. 2558) is a fine achievement, but\r\nhis best picture in this collection is the _Landscape_ (no No.), which\r\nwas bequeathed by Baron Arthur de Rothschild. His _Woody Landscape_\r\n(No. 2559), the _Road_ (No. 2559A), _Landscape_ (No. 2561), and the\r\n_Entrance to a Wood_ (No. 2561A), cannot, however, compare with his\r\n_Sunny Landscape_ (No. 2560), which bears the artist’s monogram.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HOBBEMA\r\n\r\nThe talents of Meindert Hobbema (1638-1709) were so disregarded by his\r\ncountrymen that in disgust he, at the age of thirty, took a humble\r\npost in the Customs. His woody scenes seen in the pale sunlight of the\r\nearly afternoon are not copied from any chance scenery, but composed;\r\nand his _Water Mill_ (No. 2404), fine though it is, contains passages\r\nthat will be met with elsewhere. The _Farm_ (No. 2404A) is a very good\r\npicture, as also is the _Landscape_ (No. 2403) from the Nieuwenhuys\r\ncollection. A very large number of painters, including Wyntrack, who\r\ngives us a _Farm_ (No. 2639), painted the figures into the foregrounds\r\nof Hobbema’s best works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PHILIPS WOUWERMAN\r\n\r\nIn a large number of Philips Wouwerman’s pictures the landscapes are\r\nof secondary importance to the figures; and although the execution\r\nis careful and conscientious, the frequenter of picture galleries is\r\napt to tire of his make-believe genre-pieces, landscapes with horses,\r\nriders, sportsmen, soldiers, robbers, gipsies, and the like. The Louvre\r\npresents an imposing array of fifteen of the twelve hundred or more\r\npictures by Philips Wouwerman (1619-1668), and his brother and pupil\r\nPieter is credited with a poor but historically interesting _View of\r\nthe Porte de Nesles, Paris_, in 1664 (No. 2635).\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient here to group Adam Pynacker (1622-1673) with his\r\nthree pictures, Willem Romeyn (1624?-1696?) with one, Abraham Begeyn\r\n(1637?-1697) with one, Guilliam de Heusch (1625?-1692) with one, Dirk\r\nvan den Berghen (1645-1690?) with two, and Glauber (1646-1726) with\r\na single _Landscape_ (No. 2374) in which the figures are inserted by\r\nGerard de Lairesse. Mention must, however, be made of Paul Potter,\r\nthe highly esteemed cattle painter, who died in 1654 at the early age\r\nof twenty-nine. One of his latest canvases is the _Cows and Sheep in\r\na Field_ (No. 2527), of 1652; but his _Horse in a Field_ (No. 2528)\r\nof the following year, and the _Wood at The Hague_ (No. 2529), give\r\nan excellent idea of his art. These and the _Horses at the Door of a\r\nCottage_ (No. 2526) show that Paul Potter had a sound knowledge of\r\nanimal anatomy. He is seen at his best in small compositions such as\r\nare here exhibited, in which the construction and _mise-en-scène_ are\r\nsimple and the details delicately rendered. It is a popular fallacy\r\nthat his chief contribution to the fame of Dutch art was his large\r\n_Bull_ of 1647, which measures 8 ft. by 12 ft., in The Hague Gallery.\r\nHe did not live long enough to form a “school.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE ITALIAN INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nThe Italianising influence was already beginning to make itself felt,\r\nto the lasting detriment of Dutch painting, and the typical example\r\nof this downward movement is Nicolaes Berchem (1620-1683), who was\r\nfounded on his father, Pieter Claesz, and on Pieter de Grebber, and Jan\r\nWils at Haarlem, while he also was impressed by Claes Moyaert and J.\r\nB. Weenix at Amsterdam, where he removed in 1677. There is scarcely a\r\nwell-furnished gallery in Europe that does not seek to pride itself on\r\npossessing one of Berchem’s renderings of _Crossing the Ford_, or a\r\n_Woman upon an Ass in conversation with another Person_. The Louvre is\r\nno exception to this rule, and exhibits his _Cattle crossing a Ford_\r\n(No. 2315) and nine other canvases and panels, nearly all of which bear\r\nhis much-vaunted signature. His art is to-day deservedly out of fashion\r\nwith discerning collectors.\r\n\r\nBerchem’s pupil, Karel du Jardin (1622-1678), who is invariably at\r\nmuch pain to sign his pictures, is seen to some advantage in his very\r\nItalian and in every way characteristic _Italian Charlatans_ (No.\r\n2427), the typical _Ford in Italy_ (No. 2428), and eight other works.\r\nHis attempts to depict a _Calvary_ (No. 2426) have not been crowned\r\nwith success, as the composition is overcrowded and undramatic; nor do\r\nwe experience any emotion on regarding his _Portrait of Himself_ (No.\r\n2434), a small production on copper.\r\n\r\nBreenberg (1599-1659?), who was born at Deventer, the home of Terborch,\r\nhas depicted a _View of the Campo Vaccino at Rome_ (No. 2334), and a\r\n_Ruins of the Palace of the Cæsars_ (No. 2335) in the Italian manner\r\nbeloved by Berchem and Pieter van Laer. The latter, who is also\r\nnamed Bamboccio, is represented by two small oval panels. Lingelbach\r\n(1622-1674), who frequently collaborated with other Dutch artists, may\r\nbe judged by his _Vegetable Market at Rome_ (No. 2447) and three other\r\ncanvases, and Frédéric de Moucheron (1633?-1686) by a _Leaving for the\r\nHunt_ (No. 2482). It will be convenient to mention here Reynier Nooms,\r\nwhose _View of the Old Louvre from the Seine_ (No. 2491) has some\r\nhistorical interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ARCHITECTURAL PAINTERS\r\n\r\nA limited number of painters busied themselves in making faithful\r\ntranscripts of the streets and the exterior appearance of the\r\nbuildings. Jan van der Heyden (1637-1712) was perhaps the most\r\nsuccessful in this direction, and his _View of the Town Hall of\r\nAmsterdam_ in 1688 is an excellent example of his methods, while\r\nthe Louvre also possesses three small panels by him. Jan Abrahamsz\r\nBeerstraten (1622-1666), the son of a cooper at Amsterdam, travelled\r\nto Italy and the Mediterranean, proof of which is afforded by his _Old\r\nTown Gate at Genoa_ (No. 2310). The typical architectural painter is,\r\nhowever, Gerrit Berckheyde (1638-1698). Although he never went to\r\nItaly, his _View of Trajan’s Column_ (No. 2324) is a welcome relief\r\nfrom the many versions he painted, with conspicuous success, of _The\r\nMarket-Place of Haarlem_.\r\n\r\nHendrik van Steenwyck (1580-1648) almost invariably contented himself\r\nwith reproducing the _Interiors of Churches_ (Nos. 2582, 2583); but\r\nhis _Christ in the House of Martha and Mary_ (No. 2581) is an unusual\r\nsubject with him, and must be his masterpiece. The _Vestibule of a\r\nPalace_ (No. 2490), by Isaac van Nickelle (fl. 1660), is very good of\r\nits kind; but the _Interior of a Guard-Room_ (No. 2453), by Aart van\r\nMaes, is a poor attempt at dramatic action.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MARINE PAINTERS\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Dutch had fought with swamp and water and possessed\r\na large maritime commerce, is reflected in the _Seascapes_ of Simon de\r\nVlieger (1600-1660), and in the art of Ludolf Backhuysen (1631-1708),\r\nwho is represented by a _Stormy Sea_ (No. 2309) and five other\r\ncanvases; but one of the best works of this class in the Louvre is\r\nthe _Marine-piece_ (No. 2600) by Willem van de Velde the Younger\r\n(1633-1707), who crossed over to England, and after a long career died\r\nat Greenwich. These men sought to carry on the earlier tradition of Jan\r\nvan Goyen and the two Ruisdaels, but they showed less originality and\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STILL-LIFE PAINTERS\r\n\r\nMuch appreciation and some extravagant praise has been lavished on\r\nthe still-life painters who, at the time when the higher aims of\r\nartistic endeavour began to die out in Holland, displayed remarkable\r\nability. The cultivation of horticulture at Haarlem, the centre of the\r\ntulipomania fever in the middle of the seventeenth century, may have\r\nhad an influence on the artistic presentation of inanimate nature;\r\nthis feeling was no doubt stimulated by the display made by the\r\ngoldsmiths in an age of great prosperity. Willem Claesz Heda, who was\r\nborn 1594, is among the earliest of the Dutch still-life painters, and\r\nhis picture (No. 2390) is dated 1637; he, however, did not die until\r\nmore than forty years later. Jan Davidsz de Heem (1606-1684), the\r\npainter of _Fruit and a Vase on a Table_ (No. 2391) and of another and\r\nmuch larger picture (No. 2392), was the pupil of his father, David de\r\nHeem; as he spent many years at Antwerp, he is sometimes regarded as\r\na Flemish painter. That Abraham van Beyeren (1620-1675?), who painted\r\nseveral sea-pieces, was specially fond of copying the appearance of\r\nfish, is seen from his _Still-life: Fish_ (No. 2326A), at the Louvre,\r\nwhich has in recent years also acquired another work (No. 2312A) by\r\nhim. Willem Kalf (1621?-1693) may have studied under H. G. Pot, the\r\nHaarlem genre-painter. He was evidently impressed with the chiaroscuro\r\nof Rembrandt, and often placed the drinking-cups, wine-glasses, and\r\nfruit on a richly-coloured tablecloth. He is here represented by four\r\nexamples, of which the _Dutch Interior_ (No. 2436) is the best. Eight\r\npictures by Jan Huysum (1682-1749), two by Jan van Os (1744-1808),\r\nand one by C. van Spaendonck (1756-1839) belong to the latest phase\r\nof art in Holland, and mark the decadence in full operation. It will\r\nbe noticed that the Louvre has a much larger selection of still-life\r\npictures than the National Gallery, which seems to regard achievements\r\nof this kind with disdain.\r\n\r\nMelchior Hondecoeter (1636-1695), the painter of the farmyard, gives\r\nunmistakable proof of his power in his large signed _Eagle swooping\r\ndown on a Farmyard_ (No. 2405), and two rather smaller pictures (Nos.\r\n2406-7).\r\n\r\nJan Weenix (1640-1719), who usually concerns himself with dead game\r\nand birds, is working on the usual lines in three (Nos. 2610, 2611,\r\nand 2612A) of his four pictures in the great French museum; the\r\nother represents _A Seaport_ (No. 2612). He was the fellow-pupil\r\nof Hondecoeter in the studio of his father, Jan Baptist Weenix\r\n(1621-1660), who studied for a time under the early Dutch master,\r\nAbraham Blomaert, and worked in Italy for four years. For that reason\r\nthe latter has adopted an Italian mode of signing his only picture (No.\r\n2609) in the Louvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE DECLINE\r\n\r\nAlthough Gerard Honthorst (“Gerard of the Night”) was born as early as\r\n1590, and was a pupil of Blomaert, he may he relegated to the period\r\nof decline. Almost invariably he resorted to the trick of lighting the\r\nfigures in his pictures, whether he was painting religious subjects,\r\nportraits, or conversation-pieces, with a candlelight effect. This\r\nhabit he had acquired in Italy by studying the style of Caravaggio. Of\r\nhis five pictures here, the best is perhaps the _Portrait of Charles\r\nLouis, Duke of Bavaria_ (No. 2410), of 1640. His _Concert_ (No. 2409),\r\npainted sixteen years earlier, is an ill-balanced and overloaded\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nSuch artists as Abraham Hondius, who paints a _Man Selling Pigeons_\r\n(No. 2407A); Karel de Moor, who was a pupil of G. Dou, and gives\r\nus an insignificant _Dutch Family_ (No. 2477); Eglon van der Neer,\r\nwhose name is signed on a small panel, _A Man Selling Pigeons_ (No.\r\n2485); Egbert van Heemskerck, whose _Interior_ (No. 2393) is in the La\r\nCaze collection; Jan Verkolie, whose _Interior_ (No. 2602) has been\r\nengraved; H. van Limborch, whose _Pleasures of the Golden Age_ (No.\r\n2446) was in the collection of Louis XVI.; Louis de Moni, the painter\r\nof a _Family Scene_ (No. 2476); and Willem van Mieris, a replica of\r\nwhose _Soap Bubbles_ (No. 2473) is at The Hague,—all these mediocre\r\npainters are the despair of the critic, and afford merely momentary\r\nentertainment for the curious.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that by this period the art of Holland was marked\r\nby mechanical inventions, the surface of these eighteenth-century\r\npaintings being highly fused and metallic in appearance. The four\r\npanels of Adriaen van der Werff (1659-1722), which include an\r\nunpleasant _Magdalene in the Desert_ (No. 2617) and a repulsive\r\n_Dancing Nymph_ (No. 2619), are characteristic examples of his\r\nmonotonous art. The _Disembarkation of Cleopatra_ (No. 2441) and the\r\n_Hercules between Vice and Virtue_ (No. 2443) of Gerard de Lairesse\r\n(1640-1711), have the enamel-like smoothness and meaningless expression\r\nof academic art, although they have their usefulness as museum pieces.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the Louvre does not contain a single\r\nexample of the revival of art in Holland in the third quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE EARLY FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early phases of the French school of painting—perhaps it would\r\nbe more correct to say of painting in France—present one of the most\r\ninteresting problems to the student of art history. It was not really\r\nuntil the great Exhibition of French Primitives held in Paris in 1904\r\nthat any serious attempts were made to construct a history of Early\r\nFrench painting; but the learned arguments that have been brought\r\nto bear upon the tangled question have so far failed to establish\r\nthe existence of an important autochthonous school in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. It is true that contemporary records mention the names of a\r\nfew painters who seem to have enjoyed great repute at the Courts at\r\nwhich they were employed, but it has been impossible to connect any\r\nnotable extant pictures with their names; whilst those other “French”\r\npainters who have left tangible proofs of their activity are almost\r\nwithout exception of Flemish birth and training. Indeed, most of these\r\nearly pictures show no characteristics that may be described as French,\r\nsave the types of the faces, which would naturally be taken from the\r\ncountry where the artists worked.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of dealing with the Early French pictures at the Louvre\r\nis considerably increased by the uncertainty of their authorship,\r\nthe attributions being in most cases tentative and much disputed.\r\nThroughout we feel the lack of a definite basis for comparative\r\ncriticism—the absence of properly authenticated works by the very\r\nmasters whose names have been recorded in contemporary documents. One\r\nof the earliest of these masters is Jean Malouel, a Fleming, whose\r\nreal name was Malwaele, and who worked in the service of the Dukes of\r\nBurgundy at Dijon, where he died in 1415. To him has been attributed,\r\nwithout sufficient proof, the tondo of _The Dead Christ supported by\r\nthe Eternal Father_ (No. 996) and mourned by the Virgin, St. John and\r\nAngels.\r\n\r\nEqually uncertain is the attribution of the _Last Communion and\r\nMartyrdom of St. Denis, First Bishop of Paris_ (No. 995), on which are\r\nseen, against a gold background, in the centre, the Crucified Saviour\r\nand the Eternal Father surrounded by cherubs; on the left, Christ\r\ngiving the Communion to the imprisoned bishop, with a praying angel\r\nin the foreground; and on the right, the Decollation of St. Denis and\r\nhis two companions, St. Rusticus and St. Eleutherius. An attempt has\r\nbeen made to identify this interesting picture with one ordered by\r\nJean-sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, from Jean Malouel, and finished after\r\nthat master’s death by Henri Bellechose, another Flemish painter, born\r\nin Brabant, who worked at Dijon between 1415 and 1431.\r\n\r\n_The Entombment_ (No. 997) is the work of an unknown and presumably\r\nFlemish painter, who shows a certain affinity with the painter of the\r\nfamous _Parement d’autel de Narbonne_ (No. 1342 _bis_) of about 1374.\r\nThis altar-front is supposed to be by Girard d’Orléans and his son\r\nJean, under whose name both the _Parement_ and the _Entombment_ were\r\nshown at the Exhibition of French Primitives in 1904. But all these\r\nattributions are largely conjectural.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE MAÎTRE DE MOULINS\r\n\r\nChauvinistic French critics have made much capital out of the important\r\nnational school that is supposed to have flourished towards the end\r\nof the fifteenth century at Moulins, and especially of the mysterious\r\n“Maître de Moulins,” so called from a famous triptych at Moulins which\r\ncannot be proved to be the work of a French painter, and shows very\r\nmarked Italian characteristics, although the types of the faces are\r\ndistinctly French. Italian painters had been working in France ever\r\nsince Simone Martini (1285?-1344) was employed to decorate the Pope’s\r\nPalace at Avignon; and in the absence of definite documentary evidence\r\nit will always remain a difficult matter to decide whether certain\r\npictures, Italian in style and French as regards the types, are the\r\nwork of Italian masters painting in France, or of Frenchmen trained by\r\nItalians.\r\n\r\nTo the Maître de Moulins have been loosely ascribed certain pictures\r\nin the Louvre collection, especially since attempts have been made, in\r\nthe face of great improbability, to identify him with Jehan Perréal,\r\nor Jehan de Paris, one of the few painters of that period whose\r\nFrench nationality has been satisfactorily established. Perréal was\r\nborn at Lyons, and became Court painter in Paris to Charles VIII. and\r\nLouis XII. In this capacity he was sent to England at the time of the\r\nmarriage of Louis XII. with Princess Mary Tudor, to design the bride’s\r\ntoilettes. If Perréal be the painter of _The Virgin between Two Donors_\r\n(No. 998D, formerly No. 1048, and now labelled No. —48), which bears\r\nupon the pilasters of a balustrade the letters “I P,” he is certainly\r\nnot identical with the Maître de Moulins to whom have been attributed\r\nthe portraits of _Pierre II., Sire de Beaujeu, Son-in-Law of Louis\r\nXI._ (No. 1004), and his wife, _Anne of France, Duchess of Bourbon,\r\nDaughter of Louis XI._ (No. 1005), which are apparently the wings of a\r\ntriptych of which the centre panel has disappeared. They are utterly\r\nlacking in charm of colour and are anything but masterly in treatment.\r\nBoth the personages are portrayed kneeling, the husband being presented\r\nby his Patron Saint and the wife by St. John the Evangelist. The\r\n_Portrait of Pierre_ was bought in 1842 by Louis Philippe for £20. The\r\ncompanion panel was presented to the Louvre in 1888 by M. Maciet. M.\r\nL. Dimier has rightly pointed out that there is no evidence whatever\r\nto prove these two pictures to have been painted by a French master.\r\n_The Virgin between Two Donors_ (No. 998D) has lately been tentatively\r\nattributed to the “Master of the Ursula Legend.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE DE SOMZÉE “MAGDALEN”\r\n\r\nTo the Maître de Moulins has also been attributed the somewhat\r\noverrated _Magdalen with a Female Donor_ (No. 1005A), which was\r\nformerly in the de Somzée collection at Brussels, and was, some time\r\nafter the Exhibition of French Primitives in 1904, bought from Messrs.\r\nT. Agnew & Son for £5000. The supposed similarities that have been\r\nnoticed between this picture and the Moulins triptych on the one hand,\r\nand Jehan Perréal’s authenticated design for the tomb of the Duke of\r\nBrittany at Rennes on the other hand, are not sufficiently convincing\r\neither to arrive at a definite conclusion as regards the authorship of\r\nthis _Magdalen_, or to establish the identity of the Maître de Moulins\r\nwith Jehan Perréal.\r\n\r\nOf an even more problematic nature are the _Pietà_ (No. 998C, formerly\r\nNo. 998) and the _Calvary_ (No. 998A), of which it is only safe to\r\naffirm that both were painted in France, the background showing in the\r\ncase of the former the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, the Seine,\r\nthe Louvre, and the Butte Montmartre; and in the latter an equally\r\ndistinguishable view of the Seine, the Louvre, and other buildings.\r\nBoth pictures appear to be the work of Flemish painters who were not\r\nentirely uninfluenced by Italian art. This _Calvary_ is labelled\r\n“_Retable du Parliament de Paris_,” and was formerly in the Palais de\r\nJustice in Paris.\r\n\r\nWe need not dwell at any length upon the school of Douai, which should\r\nbe considered as a branch of the Flemish rather than a national French\r\nschool. Jean Bellegambe (_c._ 1470-1535) is its chief representative,\r\nand presumably the author of the small wing of a triptych depicting the\r\nfigure of _St. Adrian_ (No. 13A) which was formerly catalogued as being\r\nof the German school (No. 2739).\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JEAN FOUQUET\r\n\r\nOf far greater importance is the school which flourished at Tours, for\r\nhere at last we meet with clearly marked personalities whose names are\r\ndefinitely connected with extant works, even if the character of their\r\nart remains essentially Flemish. The best known artist of this group\r\nis Jean Fouquet (_c._ 1425-1480?), who was Painter to Charles VII. and\r\nLouis XI. and wrought the wonderful miniatures in the famous Book of\r\nHours at Chantilly. He was distinctly more successful as an illuminator\r\nthan as a painter, although his masterpiece, the Chevalier diptych (of\r\nwhich one wing is at the Antwerp and the other at the Berlin Museum),\r\nis a work of considerable merit. The Louvre owns an interesting\r\npainting from his brush—the portrait of the corpulent Chancellor of\r\nFrance, _Guillaume Juvénal des Ursins, Baron de Trainel_ (No. 288).\r\nHe is depicted in three-quarter profile to the right, dressed in a\r\nfur-edged red robe, with hands folded in prayer, before an open book on\r\na cushion. The pilasters in the rich architectural setting terminate\r\nin two bears supporting the Chancellor’s coat of arms. This important\r\npicture was bought in 1835 for the sum of £36. It was then attributed\r\nto Michael Wohlgemuth!\r\n\r\nFouquet is known to have painted Charles VII. in 1444; but the\r\n_Portrait of Charles VII., King of France_ (No. 289), with the\r\ninscription along the top, “LE TRÈS GLORIEUX ROY DE FRANCE,” and below,\r\n“CHARLES SEPTIESME DE CE NOM,” cannot certainly be identified with the\r\npicture referred to in contemporary records. The Louvre picture was\r\nacquired in 1838 for £18.\r\n\r\nThe name of Jean Fouquet has for a long time been connected with\r\nthe admirable little portrait known as _The Man with the Wineglass_\r\n(No. 1000, formerly No. 1000A). It was shown as a work of Fouquet at\r\nthe Exhibition of French Primitives; and the attribution is still\r\nmaintained by many French critics, although in the official Catalogue\r\nthe picture is given to an Unknown French painter of the fifteenth\r\ncentury known as “The Master of 1456” from a dated picture in the\r\nLiechtenstein Gallery in Vienna. The whole style of the painting would,\r\nhowever, point to German origin, the only thing French about the\r\npicture being the type of the personage represented. It is interesting\r\nto note that this portrait, which was bought from a Paris dealer in\r\n1906 for £7600, was formerly in the collection of Count Wilczek in\r\nVienna, and was bought by its former owner at Ulm. It is probably the\r\nwork of a painter of the Swabian school.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NICOLAS FROMENT\r\n\r\nNicolas Froment, the painter of the diptych _King René and his Second\r\nWife, Jeanne de Laval_ (No. 304A), is frequently mentioned by those who\r\nhave constituted themselves champions of a supposed important Early\r\nFrench national school. The few pictures with which he may be credited\r\ninclude the _St. Siffrein_, now in the Seminary at Avignon, the\r\n_Raising of Lazarus_, now in the Kaufmann collection at Berlin, and the\r\n_Burning Bush_, which includes the Portraits of King René and Jeanne de\r\nLaval, as the Donors who ordered the picture for the Cathedral at Aix,\r\nwhere it still is. But the Louvre diptych is an inferior work. Nothing\r\nis known about the dates of his birth and death. He flourished between\r\n1460 and 1480, and was employed by good King René, who was himself a\r\npainter of some distinction, if contemporary chroniclers are to be\r\nbelieved. Froment died at Avignon, where he appears to have worked some\r\nconsiderable time, allowing his art to absorb those distinctly Italian\r\ntendencies which distinguished the productions of the Avignon school\r\never since Simone Martini had early in the fourteenth century worked in\r\nthe Provençal city of the Popes.\r\n\r\nA very typical instance of this Avignon school, with its blending of\r\nNorthern realism and the noble sense of style of the early Italians,\r\nis the _Pietà_ (No. 1001B). The group of the Virgin with the rigid body\r\nof Christ across her knees, St. John on the left and the Magdalen on\r\nthe right, has a sculpturesque dignity and grandeur not to be found in\r\nthe Northern art of that period. The Donor on the extreme left rather\r\ndestroys the balance of the composition. The mourners and the landscape\r\nare silhouetted against a gold background. The picture was formerly\r\nin the Chartreuse of Villeneuve near Avignon, and was bought by the\r\nSociété des Amis du Louvre for the great French national collection at\r\nthe price of £4000. A well-known Spanish critic has claimed that this\r\nis one of the very rare works by the Spanish artist Bartolomé Bermejo.\r\n\r\nOf the same school, but vastly inferior in conception and execution, is\r\nthe much restored _Christ rising from the Tomb, with a Donor and St.\r\nAgricola_ (No. 1001C). There are in Gallery X. (Salle Jean Fouquet) a\r\nfew more anonymous fifteenth-century paintings, which need not here be\r\ndiscussed as they are of no real significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE SIXTEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that many of the drawings and paintings which are now\r\nwith good reason believed to be the work of Jean or Jehan Clouet\r\n(called Jehannet) passed, at a time when art criticism followed methods\r\nless scientific than those which prevail at present, under the name\r\nof Holbein, should suffice to indicate that Clouet’s art belongs\r\nessentially to the Renaissance, and that the Primitive or Gothic period\r\nhad come to a close when he arrived in France from the Netherlands,\r\nwhere he was born about 1475. He apparently worked first at Tours,\r\nwhere his presence in 1516 is testified by documentary evidence; and he\r\nwent to Paris before 1529. Although he was never naturalised, he became\r\nGroom of the Chamber to François I., and enjoyed an enormous reputation\r\nfor his skill in portraiture. He died in 1540 or 1541.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        JEAN CLOUET’S DRAWINGS\r\n\r\nNot a single drawing or painting that has come down to us from this\r\nperiod, which was remarkable for its enormous production in Court\r\nportraiture, bears the signature of Jehan Clouet; but as a number of\r\nthe best portrait drawings in the famous Chantilly collection—notably\r\nthat of the _Preux de Marignan_—are obviously from the same hand, and\r\nextend, as can be proved from the age of the personages portrayed, from\r\n1514 to 1540,—the very years when Jean Clouet is known to have worked\r\nin France,—it is quite reasonable to assume that artist to be the\r\nauthor of this group of drawings. Their superiority over all the other\r\ndrawings of the period would account for the fame enjoyed by the elder\r\nClouet among his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nOn the strength of these drawings it has been possible to ascribe\r\nto Jean Clouet a few painted portraits which are obviously based\r\non the drawings and show, apart from such differences as must\r\nnecessarily result from the use of a different medium, the same\r\ncharacteristics—firm draughtsmanship, a sure delicate touch in the\r\ndelineation of the features, and also a certain stiffness and hardness\r\nof contour which are never to be found in the otherwise very similar\r\nbut always supple and masterly handling of Holbein. It is now known\r\nthat practically all the painted portraits of the period were executed\r\nfrom the delicate drawings in black and red chalk, of which so vast a\r\nnumber have come down to our day. But the fact that the vast majority\r\nof these drawings served as models to different painters leaves the\r\nquestion of attribution in a state of uncertainty. The mere tracing\r\nback of a picture to some extant drawing of acknowledged authenticity\r\ncannot be taken as proof of their common origin.\r\n\r\nTwo pictures at the Louvre are attributed to Jean Clouet. Both are\r\nportraits of _François I., King of France_, but only the smaller one\r\n(No. 127) appears to be from his hand. Clouet’s royal patron is here\r\ndepicted in three-quarter profile to the right, at the age of about\r\nthirty, so that the picture may be assumed to have been painted about\r\nthe year 1524. It is based on a drawing in the Chantilly collection.\r\nThe larger _Portrait of François I._ (No. 126) has at various times\r\nbeen attributed to Jean Clouet, Mabuse, and Joost van Cleef, but is, as\r\nhas been pointed out by M. Dimier, pronouncedly Italian in colour and\r\nin the treatment of the costume and hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FRANÇOIS CLOUET\r\n\r\nTowards the end of his life Jean Clouet was assisted in the execution\r\nof his numerous commissions by his brother Clouet de Navarre, to whom\r\nis attributed the _Portrait of Louis de Saint-Gelais, Lord of Lansac,\r\nCaptain of one of the “Compagnies des cent Gentilshommes” under Charles\r\nIX._ (No. 134), and by his son François Clouet (1500?-1572). It has\r\nbeen stated that François Clouet, who was to become after his father’s\r\ndeath the favourite portrait painter of François I., Henri II.,\r\nCatherine de Médicis, François II., and Charles IX., was born at Tours;\r\nbut it is far more likely that he too was born in the Netherlands,\r\nand, while still young, accompanied his father to France. Practically\r\nnothing is known of his life before the year 1541, when François I.\r\nrenounced to Clouet his kingly right to the artist’s inheritance, which\r\ncould have been claimed by the Crown as the estate of a foreigner. In\r\nthe same year François Clouet was appointed Groom of the Chamber and\r\nPainter-in-Ordinary to the King.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre is fortunate in possessing one of the exceedingly rare\r\nsigned pictures by this artist in the _Portrait of Pierre Quthe_ (No.\r\n127A), which was found in Vienna a few years ago by M. Moreau-Nélaton\r\nand presented to the Gallery by that active and patriotic institution,\r\nthe Société des Amis du Louvre. Pierre Quthe was a notable burgher and\r\napothecary of Paris, who owned one of the finest gardens in that city.\r\nHe was an intimate friend and neighbour of François Clouet in the rue\r\nSt. Avoye. In the Louvre painting, which bears in the left-hand bottom\r\ncorner the inscription\r\n\r\n                       FR. IANETII OPVS\r\n                       E. QUTTO AMICO SINGVLARI\r\n                       AETATIS SVE XLIII   1562\r\n\r\nhe is depicted three-quarter-length life size, dressed in a doublet of\r\nblack velvet with lace insertions, with a herbarium. The picture hangs\r\nat present on a screen in Gallery XV.\r\n\r\nAnother unquestionably authentic work is the charming _Portrait of\r\nElizabeth of Austria, Wife of Charles IX._ (No. 130), of which a\r\npreparatory study in chalk, dated 1571, is to be found in the Paris\r\nPrint Cabinet. The face is drawn and modelled with rare delicacy, and\r\nevery detail of the richly jewelled gold brocade costume is rendered\r\nwith faultless and miniature-like precision.\r\n\r\nYet another precious little picture from the same hand is the small\r\nthree-quarter-length _Portrait of Charles IX., King of France_ (No.\r\n128), which is a reduced replica of the signed life-size version in the\r\nVienna Museum. Both pictures were originally in Vienna, whence they\r\nwere removed by Napoleon in 1809, but only the larger picture was taken\r\nback to the Austrian capital in 1815.\r\n\r\nThe _Portrait of Claude de Beaune_ (No. 133A) is possibly another,\r\nthough not very important, work from the master’s own brush; but\r\nneither the _Portrait of François de Lorraine, Duc de Guise_ (No.\r\n131), nor the _Portrait of Henri II., King of France_ (No. 129), are\r\nof sufficient merit to justify their attribution to François Clouet;\r\nwhilst the portraits of _Charles IX._ (No. 132) and _Elizabeth of\r\nAustria_ (No. 133) are frankly admitted to be copies after originals by\r\nthe master.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CORNEILLE DE LYON\r\n\r\nFrançois Clouet’s chief rival in royal favour was another Netherlander\r\ndomiciled in France, who, from the city in which he spent the years of\r\nhis greatest activity, has become known as Corneille de Lyon. He was\r\napparently the head of a busy workshop at Lyons, from which were turned\r\nout large numbers of thinly painted, daintily touched-in three-quarter\r\nprofile heads, executed almost transparently on a light ground.\r\nAlthough these portraits are now generally described under the generic\r\nname of Corneille de Lyon, only the best among them can be accepted as\r\nthe master’s own handiwork. Room XI. at the Louvre contains several\r\ninsignificant and badly repainted portraits of this type. They are of\r\nno importance, as they are only copies or studio productions. Corneille\r\nbecame naturalised in 1547, in which year he was appointed Painter to\r\nthe King. He died about 1575.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE SCHOOL OF FONTAINEBLEAU\r\n\r\nThe death of Perréal and Bourdichon a few years after the accession\r\nof François I. had left France without any artists of note, save\r\nthe few foreign portrait painters employed by the Court. François\r\nI., an enthusiastic art lover, who had seen and admired the great\r\nItalian masters in their own country, spared no effort to attract the\r\nleading masters to France. We have seen that he actually succeeded\r\nin securing the services of the aged Leonardo da Vinci, and that\r\nfor a brief span Andrea del Sarto worked at his Court. When, about\r\n1530, that art-loving king turned his attention to the decoration\r\nof his palace at Fontainebleau, there was not a single painter of\r\nFrench nationality, or artist living in France, who could have been\r\nentrusted with so formidable a task, and François I. was again forced\r\nto enlist the best Italian painters available for the purpose. Having\r\nfirst engaged Pellegrino and other third-rate artists, he succeeded,\r\nin 1531, in inducing the Florentine Rosso to undertake the execution\r\nand supervision of the decorative work at Fontainebleau; and in the\r\nfollowing year the Bolognese Primaticcio entered his service. Both\r\nbelong to the Italian eclectic schools, and only concern us here in so\r\nfar as their example led to the founding of what has been called the\r\n“School of Fontainebleau,” which was really an offshoot of the Italian\r\neclectic school.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of Rosso’s and Primaticcio’s activity at\r\nFontainebleau practically all the work was done by these two painters\r\nand their Italian assistants, whose band was joined by Niccolò dell’\r\nAbbate. It was only after the death of François I. that the teaching\r\nof the Italian eclectics at Fontainebleau produced a generation of\r\nFrench artists capable of doing justice to the decorative tasks\r\nfor which an ever-increasing demand had meanwhile arisen. That the\r\nLouvre is singularly poor in works by these painters may partly be\r\naccounted for by the comparative scarcity of easel pictures painted by\r\nartists who were chiefly employed for interior decoration. There is\r\nno reason for crediting any Frenchmen with the three anonymous school\r\nof Fontainebleau pictures in Gallery XI.: _Diana_ (No. 1013), _The\r\nChastity of Scipio_ (No. 1014), and _The Toilet of Venus_ (No. 1014A).\r\n_The Chastity of Scipio_ in particular would appear to be the work of\r\nNiccolò dell’ Abbate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JEAN COUSIN\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all the French painters of the school is Jean\r\nCousin, who from the _Last Judgment_ (No. 155) at the Louvre—the only\r\nknown painting from his brush that has been preserved—has been called\r\n“The French Michelangelo.” Nothing is known of his life, save that he\r\nwas born at Soucy, near Sens, that he worked in Paris in the third\r\nquarter of the sixteenth century, and that he was still alive in 1583.\r\nComparison of his picture with Michelangelo’s great work in the Sistine\r\nChapel only helps to accentuate the absurd over-estimation to which\r\nhe owes his sobriquet. He was merely a follower of Primaticcio, an\r\nexcellent draughtsman with great knowledge of anatomy, but lacking in\r\ntaste, imagination, and real power.\r\n\r\nAmbroise Dubois (1543-1614) was born at Antwerp, but is generally\r\ncounted among the French painters of the school of Fontainebleau. He\r\nwas entrusted by Henri IV. with several important series of paintings\r\nfor the decoration of the apartments at Fontainebleau, notably with\r\neight scenes illustrating Tasso’s “_Gerusalemme Liberata_” for one of\r\nthe Queen’s rooms, and fifteen scenes from “_Theogenes and Chariclea_”\r\nby Heliodorus for the “King’s Great Closet.” One from each series has\r\nfound its way into the Louvre collection: _The Baptism of Clorinda_\r\n(No. 272), and _Chariclea, undergoing the Ordeal of Fire, is recognised\r\nby her Parents, King Hydaspes and Queen Persina_ (No. 271).\r\n\r\nThe only other painter of this group who is represented at the Louvre\r\nis Martin Fréminet (1567-1619), who was only indirectly connected with\r\nthe school of Fontainebleau, as he had received his art education in\r\nFlorence. His best known work is the ceiling of the Trinity Chapel at\r\nFontainebleau. His picture at the Louvre represents _Mercury ordering\r\nÆneas to leave Dido_ (No. 304).\r\n\r\nThe decline of the school of Fontainebleau was so rapid and complete\r\nthat, when Marie de Médicis decided to have the great gallery of the\r\nLuxembourg Palace decorated, in 1620, there was not a single painter\r\nleft in France capable to undertake this important work, which was\r\neventually entrusted to Rubens. But the whole direction to be taken by\r\nFrench seventeenth-century art had been determined by François I., and\r\nthe influence of the Late Italians remained paramount until the dawn of\r\nthe new era which was to be initiated by Watteau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the seventeenth century the impulse for the artistic\r\nactivity of France emanated from Rome. But before discussing the\r\ndominating personalities of the age we must refer to a few painters who\r\noccupy a more or less isolated position in the art of their country.\r\n\r\nThe naturalism of Caravaggio was introduced into France by two of\r\nhis followers, Jean de Boulongne, called Le Valentin (1591-1634),\r\nand Simon Vouet (1590-1649), who was also slightly influenced by the\r\nVenetians. Valentin spent the best part of his life in Rome, where he\r\ndied in 1634. The Louvre owns, among eight pictures from his brush\r\n(not all of which are exhibited), his masterpiece, _The Innocence of\r\nSusannah recognised_ (No. 56), which has the vigorous handling and bold\r\nchiaroscuro of the Neapolitan school.\r\n\r\nSimon Vouet, who came to England at the age of fifteen, and\r\nsubsequently travelled in Turkey and Italy, where he remained until\r\nhis appointment as Painter to the King took him back to Paris in 1627,\r\ntried to combine the naturalism of Caravaggio with the colouring of the\r\nVenetians, an endeavour in which he was only partially successful, as\r\nhe was not equipped by nature with a sensuous appreciation of beautiful\r\ncolour. The Louvre owns a dozen Scriptural subjects and allegorical\r\nfigures by Vouet; but even the best of them, _The Presentation of Jesus\r\nin the Temple_ (No. 971), is but a dull and heavy performance; whilst\r\nhis _Portrait of Louis XIII._ (No. 976) is wholly devoid of artistic\r\nmerit. Perhaps he owes his fame chiefly to the fact that he was the\r\nmaster of the absurdly overrated Le Sueur and of that art despot of the\r\nLouis XIV. era, Charles Le Brun.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BROTHERS LE NAIN\r\n\r\nOf far greater artistic significance are the three brothers, Antoine,\r\nLouis, and Matthieu Le Nain, who were born at Laon, and flourished\r\nin Paris during the first half of the seventeenth century. Antoine\r\nand Louis died in 1648, and Matthieu in 1677. Very little is known of\r\ntheir history, but the splendid array of their works in Gallery XIII.\r\nproves them to have had close affinities with the contemporary Dutch\r\nand Flemish schools, even if their manner of composition suggests close\r\nacquaintance with Spanish art. Their subjects, too, like those of many\r\nof the Northern masters of their time, are taken from the daily life of\r\nthe people, which is rendered with naïve honesty, and at times with a\r\nreal appreciation of beautiful pigment. So far it has been impossible\r\nto distinguish between the works of the three brothers, as even the\r\nsignatures “LE NAIN, fecit 1647,” on the _Portraits in an Interior_\r\n(No. 543), and “LE NAIN, fecit anno 1642,” on the _Peasants at their\r\nMeal_ (No. 548, La Caze Gallery), afford no clue to the solution of the\r\nproblem. The striking differences in brushwork and colouring, which\r\nare to be noticed in the eleven Le Nain pictures at the Louvre, would\r\ncertainly suggest that the three brothers did not, or did only rarely,\r\ncollaborate on the same pictures. The painter of _The Return from\r\nHaymaking_ (No. 542), with its prophetic suggestion of the _plein-air_\r\neffects of late nineteenth-century art, cannot have had much in common\r\nwith the painter of the dull and dingy _Denial of St. Peter_ (No. 547).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NICOLAS POUSSIN\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Classicist school of French painting, which has\r\nhad official approval and support from his time to the present day,\r\nwas Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665). Born at Les Andelys in Normandy, he\r\nwent to Paris at the age of eighteen, and became so fascinated by the\r\nexamples of antique sculpture that, in spite of his extreme poverty,\r\nhe determined to continue his studies in Rome. It is unnecessary here\r\nto relate the struggles that preceded his arrival at Rome in 1624.\r\nHe frequented the school of Domenichino; but what was more decisive\r\nfor the formation of his style was his unceasing study of antique\r\nsculpture, in which he was guided and encouraged by his friend, the\r\nsculptor Duquesnoy. After some years of continued poverty, he found\r\nat last liberal patronage, and rose to such fame that on his return\r\nto Paris in 1640 he was appointed Painter-in-Ordinary to the King.\r\nHowever, the duties and restrictions attached to this position proved\r\nso irksome to Poussin, that after two years he returned to Rome, where\r\nhe spent the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nAt the Louvre is to be found an imposing array of forty canvases by\r\nPoussin, whose art is as typical an expression of French genius as\r\nthe poetry of Corneille. It is essentially intellectual, based on\r\ntheoretical rules of design and composition, not in the least sensuous\r\nor emotional, but always coldly classical. The vast majority of his\r\npaintings at the Louvre are in such a deplorable state of deterioration\r\nand neglect that it is almost impossible to form an adequate idea\r\nof their original colour, but even the most ardent admirers of the\r\nmaster do not maintain that he was a great colourist. His pictures are\r\nentirely dependent on beauty of form and rhythmic design. They might\r\nalmost be described as painted reliefs. This applies at least to his\r\ntreatment of the human figure. His conception of landscape, though\r\nstill severely classical, is more pictorial and testifies to a genuine\r\nlove of Nature—Nature idealised by a lofty imagination. To appreciate\r\nhis greatness as a landscape painter, one has only to examine the\r\nglorious setting to his _Orpheus and Eurydice_ (No. 740). The figures\r\nhere are really of quite subordinate importance—mere incidents in a\r\nlandscape painted with consummate mastery, perfect in linear and aerial\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\n_The Shepherds in Arcadia_ (No. 734, Plate XXXVII.) may be quoted to\r\nillustrate the calculated rhythm of his design and his indebtedness\r\nto classic art from which he derived his nobility of form. Real\r\ndramatic action was beyond Poussin’s range. His famous _Rape of the\r\nSabine Women_ (No. 724) is a striking instance of his failure to\r\ngrasp the significant difference between dramatic movement and mere\r\nheroic posturing. Far more inspired, and therefore more natural and\r\ndramatically effective, is the superb circular painting for a ceiling\r\ncommissioned by Cardinal Richelieu and representing _Time rescuing\r\nTruth from the Attacks of Envy and Discord_ (No. 735). The allegory is\r\nsaid to have been intended as an allusion to the circumstances which\r\ninduced Poussin to leave Paris for good. The design has more real\r\nvitality than is generally to be found in Poussin’s work; the action of\r\nthe figures is more natural; and the colour music is not drowned by the\r\nprevalence of dingy browns. The decorative effect heralds in a strange\r\nway the art of the next century, and particularly that of Boucher.\r\n\r\nTo see Poussin in the right perspective as regards the world’s great\r\nmasters, one need only compare his two _Bacchanals_ (Nos. 729 and\r\n730) with Titian’s rendering of a similar theme. The comparison is\r\ndisastrous for the eclectic Frenchman. A _Portrait of the Painter_ (No.\r\n743) from Poussin’s own brush is to be found in Room XIV., where no\r\nfewer than thirty-seven of his pictures are on view.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                     PLATE XXXVII.—NICOLAS POUSSIN\r\n\r\n                              (1594-1665)\r\n\r\n                             FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                   No. 734.—THE SHEPHERDS IN ARCADIA\r\n\r\n                        (Les Bergers d’Arcadie)\r\n\r\n  In the centre of a landscape with receding ranges of hills, three\r\n  shepherds, leaning on their long staves, and a maiden in classic\r\n  garb, are gathered around an ancient tomb surrounded by trees.\r\n  An inscription on the tomb, “_Et in Arcadia Ego_,” engages their\r\n  attention. One of the shepherds is kneeling and reading the\r\n  inscription to his companion on the left, whilst the third man of\r\n  the group leans forward to point out to the maiden the significance\r\n  of the inscription.\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on canvas.\r\n\r\n  2 ft. 9½ in. × 3 ft. 11½ in. (0·85 × 1·21.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CLAUDE LORRAIN\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, the otherwise very complete collection of French\r\npictures at the Louvre does not contain a single example of Poussin’s\r\nbrother-in-law, Gaspard Dughet, better known as Gaspard Poussin\r\n(1613-1675), who devoted himself more exclusively to landscape than\r\ndid his more illustrious relative. Nicolas Poussin’s influence also\r\nbecame decisive for the formation of the style of Claude Gellée,\r\ncalled Le Lorrain (1600-1682), who is represented at the Louvre by\r\nseventeen pictures (Nos. 310-326), most of which also have suffered\r\nconsiderably from discoloration and neglect. Claude, who was the child\r\nof poor parents, started life as a cook. In this capacity he went to\r\nRome, where his talent for art was discovered by the landscape painter\r\nAgostino Tassi, to whom he served as cook and apprentice. Having\r\nlearned all he could from his master, he returned to France in 1625,\r\nbut, like Poussin, preferred to go back to Rome after two years spent\r\nin his native country. In the Papal city he lived the rest of his days,\r\nand rose to fame and affluence.\r\n\r\nHe was essentially a landscape painter. The historical and legendary\r\nincidents introduced in such pictures as _The Disembarkation of\r\nCleopatra at Tarsis_ (No. 314), or _Ulysses restoring Chryseis to her\r\nFather_ (No. 316), were to him a mere excuse for painting classic\r\nlandscapes and imaginary buildings of noble proportion bathed in a\r\ngolden atmosphere, which has hardly been rivalled by any contemporary\r\nor later painter. It is only on rare occasions, as in the _View of\r\nthe Campo Vaccino at Rome_ (No. 311), that he applied his gifts to\r\nthe portrayal of nature. As a rule, his views are carefully arranged\r\ncombinations of architectural and landscape elements brought together\r\narbitrarily, and generally disposed in the manner of the wings and\r\nbackcloth of a stage scene, but connected by the unity of light and\r\natmosphere. Considering this method, it is amazing that his memory\r\nenabled him to invent such imaginary scenes with so great a degree\r\nof truth. _The View of a Sea Port_ (No. 317, Plate XXXVIII.), in the\r\nsubdued light of a misty day, is a magnificent instance of his masterly\r\nmanagement of aerial perspective. It is signed and dated “CLAUDE IN\r\nROMA, 1646.” It is generally known how much Turner in his first manner\r\nowed to the example of Claude. That even Watteau was indebted to him\r\nmay be gathered from such pictures as _The Village Fête_ (No. 312),\r\nwhich, signed and dated, “CLAUDIO, inv. Romæ, 1639,” contains in germ\r\nthe elements that constituted the greatness of the eighteenth-century\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LE SUEUR\r\n\r\nWhilst Poussin and Claude were working in Rome, two pupils of Vouet\r\nreaped the highest honours in France. Eustache Le Sueur (1617-1655),\r\nwhom his compatriots in their incomprehensible over-estimation of his\r\nmediocre gifts have called the “French Raphael,” certainly strove\r\nto emulate the divine Urbinate; but how badly he succeeded in this\r\nendeavour is to be gathered from the fifty-two paintings, by the\r\nplacing of which his memory is retained at the Louvre. What dignity\r\nthere is in the simple flow of line in his designs, is completely\r\nruined by the offensive crudeness of his colour. Even allowing for the\r\ninevitable fluctuations of taste in matters of art, it is difficult\r\nnow to understand how enthusiasm could ever have been aroused by the\r\nworks that were considered his masterpieces, _St. Paul preaching at\r\nEphesus_ (No. 560), which at the beginning of last century was valued\r\nat £10,000 (!), and the twenty-two _Scenes from the Life of St. Bruno_\r\n(Nos. 564-585), painted between 1645 and 1648 for the small cloister\r\nof the Carthusians in Paris. This series, which is a severe tax on\r\nthe patience of the conscientious visitor, fills the whole of Gallery\r\nXII., whilst other paintings connected with it intrude into the\r\nadjoining room, which is consecrated to the brothers Le Nain.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n          PLATE XXXVIII.—CLAUDE GELLÉE, CALLED CLAUDE LORRAIN\r\n\r\n                              (1600-1682)\r\n\r\n                             FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                      No. 317.—VIEW OF A SEAPORT\r\n\r\n                (Vue d’un Port de Mer: Effet de Brume)\r\n\r\n  In the foreground, on the beach, are groups of men occupied with\r\n  unloading merchandise and cattle.

(1·19 × 1·50.)]\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to Vouet’s most famous pupil, Charles Le Brun,\r\nwhose despotic power imposed upon French painting during the “_grand\r\nsiècle_” its pompous rhetorical character, mention should be made of\r\nSébastien Bourdon (1616-1671), who, but for his prolonged sojourn in\r\nRome, which fed his ambition to excel in the “grand style,” would\r\nhave been one of the most remarkable artists of his century. This\r\nconclusion is, at least, justified by his precious little painting of\r\na group of _Beggars_ (No. 76), which is perhaps unrivalled in French\r\nseventeenth-century art for quality of paint and appreciation of\r\ntone values; and by his excellent _Portrait of the Philosopher René\r\nDescartes_ (No. 78), who was also painted by Frans Hals (No. 2383). In\r\nhis treatment of scriptural and historical subjects he does not rise\r\nabove the dull level of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHARLES LE BRUN\r\n\r\nCharles Le Brun (1619-1690) studied first under Vouet, but, attracted\r\nby Poussin’s stronger personality, followed that master to Rome in\r\n1642, and continued his studies under his guidance. When Le Brun\r\nreturned to Paris four years later, his reputation was already firmly\r\nestablished. Patronised by Louis XIV.’s powerful minister, Colbert, he\r\nwas placed at the head of the newly founded Academy of Painting, and of\r\nthe Gobelins Manufactory, became First Painter to the King and “Prince”\r\nof the French Academy in Rome; and was, in fact, given absolute power\r\nin all matters concerning the fostering of the arts and art industries.\r\nThis despotic power explains how it was possible that Le Brun, who\r\nnotwithstanding his brilliant executive skill and extraordinary\r\nfacility never rose above the level of mediocrity, could impose his\r\nuninspired personality upon every phase of French artistic activity of\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\nHis enormous canvases at the Louvre, which probably occupy more space\r\nthan has been allotted to any other painter, vainly endeavour to\r\nconceal the lack of real emotion and of a central motif by theatrical\r\ngestures and overcrowding. His masterpiece at the Louvre is _The Tent\r\nof Darius_ (No. 511), which represents the family of Darius imploring\r\nAlexander the Great for mercy. But even here one feels the absence of\r\ndramatic inspiration and concentration. Less successful are the other\r\nscenes from the history of Alexander: _The Passage of the Granicus_\r\n(No. 509), _The Battle of Arbela_ (No. 510), _Alexander and Porus_\r\n(No. 512), _Alexander entering Babylon_ (No. 513). The whole series\r\nwas painted between 1661 and 1668 for execution in tapestry and was\r\nexhibited at the Salon in 1673, the year in which for the first time\r\nan official catalogue was compiled. Besides many scriptural and\r\nmythological subjects, and a few portraits from Le Bran’s brush, there\r\nare at the Louvre his decorative paintings on the ceiling of the\r\nGalerie d’Apollon in which the magnificent centre panel was added two\r\ncenturies later by Delacroix.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PIERRE MIGNARD\r\n\r\nLe Bran’s successor in the direction of the Academy and the Gobelin\r\nworks, Pierre Mignard (1612-1695), called “Le Romain” owing to his long\r\ndomicile in Rome after the completion of his studies under Vouet, did\r\nnot have his precursor’s large decorative faculty and sweeping ease of\r\nexecution. Yet the excessively affected grace and the careful finish\r\nof his pictures, of which _The Virgin of the Grapes_ (No. 628) is a\r\nthoroughly characteristic instance, helped to raise him to an exalted\r\nposition in the opinion of his contemporaries. To this day the affected\r\nstyle of prettiness of which he was the high priest is known as\r\n“_mignardise_.” His power was altogether insufficient for the ambitious\r\ndecorative tasks he set himself in emulation of Le Brun. If he has any\r\nclaim to the esteem of posterity, it is for having left the world a\r\nportrait gallery of the notable men and women of his time—portraits\r\nwhich are by no means free from flattery and mannered grace, but\r\nconstitute, nevertheless, a valuable historical record. Of these the\r\nLouvre owns the _Portrait of the Artist at Work in his Studio_ (No.\r\n640); the _Portrait of Françoise d’Aubigne, Marquise de Maintenon_ (No.\r\n639); and the life-size group of _Louis of France, Son of Louis XIV.,\r\nhis Wife, and their three Children_ (No. 638).\r\n\r\nColbert and Le Brun had succeeded but too well in carrying out the\r\npowerful minister’s ambition to direct French art towards industrial\r\nand decorative aims, to train an army of capable producers, and to\r\nplace the whole organisation on what may be called a business basis.\r\nThe system was, however, not favourable for the growth of independent\r\ngenius. With few exceptions, the whole generation of painters that\r\ngrew up under Le Brun’s régime are of no significance to the history\r\nof art. There were among them many capable craftsmen, but they only\r\nrepeated in a feebler way what Le Brun had done on a more imposing and\r\ndazzling scale. Whole dynasties of painters arose, like the Boulognes\r\nand the Coypels, who, under official patronage, filled acres of canvas\r\nwith florid, theatrical renderings of scriptural subjects, and with the\r\nbombastic mock-heroics of classic history and mythology seen through\r\nbaroque spectacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LE BRUN’S FOLLOWERS\r\n\r\nIt would be giving undue importance to these painters of the Louis XIV.\r\nperiod if we were to go beyond a mere enumeration of their leaders and\r\ntheir chief works at the Louvre. None of them possessed any marked\r\nindividuality; and most of them were linked together, not only by\r\nsimilar aims and ambitions, but also by family ties. Four members of\r\nthe Coypel family rose to great eminence among their fellow-artists,\r\nand to important official positions. Noël Coypel (1628-1707), the\r\npainter of the four historical compositions, _Solon defending his Laws\r\nbefore the Athenians_ (No. 157), _Ptolomy Philadelphus giving the Jews\r\ntheir Freedom_ (No. 158), _Trajan giving a Public Audience_ (No. 159),\r\nand the _Foresight of Septimus Severus_ (No. 160), all of which were\r\noriginally executed for the Council Chamber at Versailles; his sons\r\nAntoine Coypel (1661-1722), whose best known pictures at the Louvre are\r\nthe _Susannah and the Elders_ (No. 169) and the _Democritos_ (No. 174),\r\nwhich recalls Jordaens in its exuberant life, and Noël Nicolas Coypel\r\n(1692-1734), whose goddesses and nymphs already reflect the taste which\r\ndominated the eighteenth century; as well as Antoine’s son, Charles\r\nAntoine Coypel (1694-1752), whose uninspired art may best be studied in\r\nthe _Perseus delivering Andromeda_ (No. 180).\r\n\r\n_The Triumph of Bacchus_ (No. 447) and _The Annunciation_ (No. 445),\r\nby Charles de La Fosse (1636-1716); _Hercules fighting the Centaurs_\r\n(No. 53), by Bon Boulogne (1649-1717); and _The Marriage of St.\r\nCatherine_ (No. 55), by his brother Louis Boulogne (1654-1733), only\r\nserve to illustrate the mediocrity of their respective authors. The\r\nimpersonality of Bon Boulogne’s art had at least the advantage that his\r\nteaching left free scope for personal expression to his many pupils.\r\n\r\nEven the still-life painting of the “_grand siècle_,” which found its\r\nchief exponent in Jean Baptiste Monnoyer (1634-1699), partakes of the\r\nlove of pomp and display that characterises this period. Gold and\r\nsilver vases, precious stuffs and furniture generally accompany his\r\nflowers, which are painted without real appreciation of their natural\r\nbeauty, and in purely local tints without a hint of the effect of each\r\ncolour upon its surroundings. The _Flowers_ (No. 648), in the La Caze\r\nGallery, may be mentioned as a typical example.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BATTLE PAINTERS\r\n\r\nThe battle painter, Jacques Courtois (1621-1676), called Borgognone\r\nand Le Bourguignon, though born in France, was so completely under the\r\nspell of the art of Italy, the country where he spent almost his entire\r\nlife, that he can scarcely be reckoned as belonging to the French\r\nschool. His furious cavalry _mêlées_, though entirely imaginative (as\r\nsuch confused encounters of horsemen piercing each other’s ranks have\r\nnever taken place in actual warfare), are painted, like the _Cavalry\r\nFight_ (No. 151), with a touch as swift as it is sure and expressive,\r\nand full of exuberant vitality.\r\n\r\nJoseph Parrocel (1678-1704), who, during a prolonged visit to Rome had\r\nbenefited by Borgognone’s teaching, could not, after his return to\r\nFrance in 1675, escape the current of thought which dominated his time,\r\nand introduced the stage-heroic note into his master’s sham realism.\r\nThe glorification of his king is the purpose of such pictures as _The\r\nPassage of the Rhine by Louis XIV._ (No. 678). The chief interest is\r\ncentred in the richly apparelled group on their prancing steeds in the\r\nforeground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JEAN JOUVENET\r\n\r\n_The Descent from the Cross_ (No. 437), by Jean Jouvenet (1644-1717),\r\nwhich has been honoured by a position among the masterpieces in the\r\nSalon Carré, is certainly one of the most estimable compositions\r\nproduced in France during this active but uninspired century. Not only\r\nin the general disposition of the design, but also in the use of colour\r\nas a constructive element, Jouvenet here acknowledges his indebtedness\r\nto Rubens, although he could never rival the luminous glow of the great\r\nFleming’s palette. Most of his other pictures suffer from dull heavy\r\nshadows and exaggerated expression. His strong and honest painting\r\nof the kneeling group in _The Abbé Delaporte officiating at the High\r\nAltar of Nôtre-Dame_ (No. 440), makes us regret that he did not devote\r\nhimself more to subjects taken from the life of his time.\r\n\r\nAn artist who was less tied to the tyranny of the official school, and\r\nimbued with a really profound sense of the beautiful, was Jean Baptiste\r\nSanterre (1658-1717). The delicate perfection of form of the nude in\r\n_Susannah and the Elders_ (No. 835) approaches him to David and Ingres\r\nat their best. But this very perfection carries the germ of decay,\r\nbecause it is incapable of progress, and stagnation in art signifies\r\ndeath. As regards his technique, Santerre was extremely careful and\r\nconscientious. He reduced his palette to but five colours, and waited\r\nten years after the completion of a picture before putting on the final\r\ncoat of varnish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE PORTRAIT PAINTERS\r\n\r\nThe two great portrait painters who flourished under the “Grand\r\nMonarque,” Rigaud and Largillière, were preceded by an artist to whom,\r\nperhaps owing to the relative scarceness of his works, history has\r\ndone but scant justice. Whilst the Louvre contains thirteen portraits\r\nby Largillière and seventeen by Rigaud, only two pictures stand to the\r\nname of Claude Lefebvre (1632-1675); but his _Portraits of a Master\r\nand his Pupil_ (No. 529) and the _Portrait of a Man_ (No. 530), are\r\ndistinguished by a penetrating insight into character and an incisive\r\nvigour of style that form a striking contrast to the shallow bombast\r\nintroduced even into portraiture by the fashionable painters to the\r\nCourt. Lefebvre has been compared with Van Dyck. The _Portrait of a\r\nMan_ (No. 530) has more in common with the brilliant audacity of Frans\r\nHals’s brushwork. Lefebvre worked for some years in London, where he\r\nwas a favourite at the Court of Charles II.\r\n\r\nRigaud’s manner of portraiture has none of these serious, manly\r\nqualities, but his skill in arranging the sumptuous accessories which\r\nplay so important a part in his portraits,—as important, at least,\r\nas the actual features of the sitters,—secured him the patronage of\r\nthe pomp-loving, haughty nobility. Hyacinthe Rigaud y Ros (1659-1743)\r\nwas born at Perpignan and educated at Montpellier and Lyons. It was\r\nthe advice of Le Brun that saved him from the customary pilgrimage to\r\nRome and its inevitable consequences. It was Le Brun who recognised\r\nRigaud’s bent for portraiture, and launched him on the brilliant\r\ncareer which gained for him the title of “the French Van Dyck.” Rigaud\r\nwas enormously productive. Between 1681 and 1698 he is said to have\r\npainted six hundred and twenty-three portraits. And he had then another\r\nforty-five years before him!\r\n\r\nRigaud’s best known picture at the Louvre is the stately _portrait\r\nd’apparat_ of _King Louis XIV._ (No. 781), a life-size full length,\r\nin which the spirit of the time, the curious blending of supercilious\r\nhaughtiness, love of display, and affected grace of manner, are\r\nhappily expressed in the monarch’s attitude and in the whole setting.\r\nThe picture is signed and dated, “PEINT PAR HYACINTHE RIGAUD, 1701.”\r\nThe same tendencies are to be noted in the full length _Portrait of\r\nBossuet, Bishop of Meaux_ (No. 783), in which it is surprising that\r\nthe prelate’s personality is not completely smothered by the splendid\r\nprofusion of the accessories. His gifts appear, however, in a better\r\nlight in his excellent _Portraits of Marie Serre, the Artist’s Mother_\r\n(No. 784), with the same head, honestly and soberly painted, twice on\r\nthe same canvas, once in sharp profile looking to the right, and again,\r\nfacing this, a three-quarter profile to the left. Wholly unexpected\r\nis the delicacy and softness of one of his pictures in the La Caze\r\nRoom: the _Portrait of the Duke of Lesdiguières as a Child_ (No. 792).\r\nHis solitary excursion into the domain of “grand art” at the Louvre\r\nis at the same time his last work: _The Presentation in the Temple_\r\n(No. 780), which in grouping and lighting owes much to the study of\r\nRembrandt.\r\n\r\nNicolas de Largillière (1656-1746) was born in Paris, but was taken\r\nwhen still an infant to Antwerp, where he became a pupil of Goebouw.\r\nFrom 1674 to 1680 he worked in London as an assistant of Sir Peter\r\nLely, from whom he acquired the clever tricks and mannerisms in the\r\npainting of draperies and the textures of silks and velvets and other\r\nmaterials, which were to form so important a part of his artistic\r\nequipment. After Lely’s death Largillière went to Paris, where he not\r\nonly shared with Rigaud the patronage of the Court as portrait painter,\r\nbut secured many important commissions for historical paintings which,\r\nperhaps to the advantage of his fame, are now all but forgotten.\r\nLargillière was not without distinction as a brilliant and daring\r\ncolourist. Nor was he incapable, on occasion, of seizing the subtleties\r\nof his sitters’ character. But his praiseworthy qualities are more than\r\nbalanced by his unpleasant affectations and by the baroque squirminess\r\nof his line. This tendency carried him to such insufferable excesses as\r\nthe conglomeration of lumpy bosses which does duty for a hand in his\r\n_Portrait of M. Du Vaucel_ (No. 484), in the La Caze Room.\r\n\r\nHis boastful skill in the management of the satins and velvets in the\r\noverrated portrait group of _Largillière with his Wife and Daughter\r\nin a Garden_ (No. 491), cannot atone for the singularly unfortunate\r\nand clumsy composition, and for the self-conscious affectation of each\r\nindividual pose. More satisfactory, in spite of the superabundance of\r\naccessories and outward pomp, which in this case is a fitting attribute\r\nto the character of the sitter, is the _Portrait of Charles Le Brun,\r\nFirst Painter to King Louis XIV._ (No. 482), who is depicted in a\r\ncolossal wig, seated before an easel, and wearing a superbly painted\r\nred velvet cloak.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LANDSCAPE PAINTERS\r\n\r\nIt almost goes without saying that landscape art, which, even in its\r\nmost artificial and “classic” phase is inspired by the love and study\r\nof nature, was sadly neglected in so artificial an age. Among its\r\nleading exponents must be mentioned the two Patels, father and son, of\r\nwhose life we have but scant knowledge, and whose pictures resemble one\r\nanother’s so closely that it is often difficult to determine which is\r\nby Pierre Patel, the father (1620?-1676), and which by Pierre Antoine\r\nPatel, the son (1648-1708), especially as both adopted the signature,\r\n“P. PATEL.” In the case of the older artist’s _The Exposure of Moses\r\non the Nile_ (No. 680), and _Moses burying the Egyptian whom he had\r\nSlain_ (No. 681), and his son’s four landscapes representing the\r\nmonths, _January_ (No. 684), _April_ (No. 685), _August_ (No. 686),\r\nand _September_ (No. 687), all doubts are set aside by the dates which\r\naccompany the signature. Both artists were close followers of Claude\r\nLorrain, although their precise technique suggests the influence of\r\nAdam Elsheimer.\r\n\r\nA truer perception of nature came to France from the North, whence,\r\nindeed, throughout the history of French painting vitality was infused\r\ninto an art that was cramped by officially imposed canons of Italian\r\nperfection. As far back as the time of Le Brun, Félibien and Roger de\r\nPiles had begun in the field of literary polemics the long struggle\r\nbetween the _Poussinistes_ and _Rubenistes_, the adherents of an art\r\ndominated by design and perfect drawing, against the partisans of\r\ncolour as a vital element. During the whole seventeenth century the\r\nPoussinistes, who commanded all the official support, held the field,\r\nthough the Netherlandish strain was represented by some of the finest\r\npainters of that period, like the brothers Le Nain, C. Lefebvre,\r\nand Philippe de Champaigne. In the eighteenth century the Northern\r\ninfluence became supreme through Watteau and Chardin on the one hand,\r\nand on the other through Boucher and Fragonard, both of whom were\r\npowerfully influenced by the study of Rubens’s works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DESPORTES\r\n\r\nIn landscape the healthy opposition to the prevailing classic style\r\nappears first in the work of the Flemish battle painter Van der Meulen,\r\nwhose backgrounds, sketched on the spot, show a fine feeling for\r\naerial perspective and atmospheric effects. But his example apparently\r\nattracted no followers. Though not, strictly speaking, a landscape\r\npainter, François Desportes (1661-1743), who owed less to his early\r\ntraining under Nicasius, a third-rate Fleming, than to his habit of\r\nusing his own eyes and studying nature direct, treated landscape with\r\nsimilar freedom in the backgrounds to his portraits and pictures of\r\nthe chase. In his paintings of animals, dead or alive, limp bodies of\r\nhares and birds arranged as still-life with flowers and fruits, or in a\r\nvery frenzy of movement in his hunting pieces, he endeavours to emulate\r\nSnyders, without quite rivalling the Flemish master. Of his twenty-five\r\npictures at the Louvre, twenty-three (Nos. 225-248) belong to this\r\ngenre, but not all of them are actually exhibited. The _Portrait of a\r\nHuntsman_ (No. 224), and the _Portrait of the Artist_ (No. 249) seated\r\nunder a tree, holding a gun in his right, and caressing with his left\r\nhand a hound whose paw is resting on a pile of dead game, serve to\r\nprove that he knew how to manage portraiture with the same bold, frank\r\nspirit and summary breadth. He was particularly happy in rendering,\r\nwithout laboured detail, the varying textures of fur and plumage.\r\n\r\nDesportes’s only successful rival as a painter of animals and hunting\r\nscenes was Jean Baptiste Oudry (1686-1755). How closely his style\r\nresembled that of the elder painter is to be seen from his _Wolf Hunt_\r\n(No. 667), the _Dog watching Dead Game_ (No. 668), and one or two\r\nsimilar pieces at the Louvre. Oudry was first taught by his father,\r\nand subsequently by Largillière, who encouraged him in the painting of\r\nstill-life, and directed his study particularly to the observation of\r\ntone values and of the interchange of colour that takes place between\r\nobjects in close proximity to each other. In 1734, Oudry was appointed\r\nDirector of the Beauvais Tapestry Works, which took a new lease of life\r\nunder his able management. It was he who supplied the designs for the\r\n_Fables of La Fontaine_, which figure so frequently in the tapestries\r\nwoven at that great establishment. Perhaps his most interesting picture\r\nat the Louvre is the large landscape _The Farm_ (No. 670), signed and\r\ndated 1750, one of the earliest examples in French art of a rustic\r\nscene painted for its own sake, without any attempt at ennobling the\r\nlandscape by forcing it into a formal arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GENRE PAINTERS\r\n\r\nIt is quite in accordance with the tendencies displayed by these\r\nmasters, that towards the end of the seventeenth and the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century an increasing number of artists preferred\r\nto devote their talent to recording the life of their own days to\r\nthe endless repetition of the “grand-manner” subjects which had\r\noccupied the energy of the preceding generations. Thus Jean Alexis\r\nGrimou (1678-1740), who was Swiss by birth and entirely self-trained,\r\nintroduced into French art the drinking scenes beloved of the Flemish\r\nmasters. From his painting of _A Drinker_ (No. 385) and the two\r\n_Portraits of Young Soldiers_ (Nos. 386 and 387), it may be seen how\r\nlittle he was in sympathy with the official art of his time; this is\r\nscarcely to be wondered at, since, instead of undergoing the customary\r\ncourse of academic training, he had formed his style by copying the\r\nworks of Rembrandt and other Northern masters.\r\n\r\nPierre Subleyras (1699-1749) was not quite so emancipated. In his large\r\nreligious compositions he still follows the affectations of the grand\r\nstyle. His chief work of this kind is the _Mass of St. Basil_, at Sta.\r\nMaria degli Angeli in Rome, of which No. 857 at the Louvre is a reduced\r\nversion. Of far more artistic significance are his small genre pieces,\r\nin which he attains to a rich quality of pigment and a justice of\r\ntone-values unique in French painting of his period. Subleyras is said\r\nto have been of Spanish descent; and there are in his scenes from La\r\nFontaine’s “Fables”—notably in _The Hermit_ (No. 862)—clear indications\r\nof his intimate acquaintance with Spanish art. The best of all his\r\npictures at the Louvre is _The Falcon_ (No. 861), which, apart from its\r\ngeneral quality of tone, contains some still-life passages worthy of\r\nthe brush of Chardin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RAOUX AND DE TROY\r\n\r\nJust as Subleyras should be judged by his genre scenes rather than by\r\nhis scriptural subjects, so Jean Raoux’s (1677-1734) real significance\r\nlies in the intimate note he introduced into his fancy portraits, and\r\nnot in his moderately successful excursions into mythology, like the\r\n_Telemachus relating his Adventures to Calypso_, at the Louvre (No.\r\n764). The _Young Woman reading a Letter_ (No. 765), in the La Caze\r\nRoom, is perhaps the most charming of many similar pictures from his\r\nbrush. In sentiment it belongs entirely to the amorous century of Louis\r\nXV., which was to produce a Fragonard and a Greuze. Raoux was one of\r\nthe first French painters of contemporary life. Brought up in the old\r\ntradition, he was in his last years influenced by the personality of\r\nthe great Watteau.\r\n\r\nIf Raoux was the somewhat sentimental painter of bourgeois life, Jean\r\nFrançois de Troy (1679-1752) played not infrequently the chronicler\r\nof the elegant life of the leisured classes. Unfortunately this\r\ninteresting phase of his art is not represented at the Louvre, which,\r\nbesides the three _Portraits_ (Nos. 886-888) in the La Caze collection,\r\ncontains two of his famous designs for tapestry, representing scenes\r\nfrom the _History of Esther_ (Nos. 884-885); and his large historical\r\npainting, _The First Chapter of the Order of the Holy Ghost, held by\r\nHenri IV. in 1595_ (No. 883).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                WATTEAU\r\n\r\nThe master who was to break definitely with the cold, majestic,\r\nuninspired art of the seventeenth century, and who in leading\r\nFrench painting into new paths reached the very limits of poetic\r\nexpressiveness imposed by material means, was Antoine Watteau\r\n(1684-1721). Born at Valenciennes six years before that city became\r\nFrench through the peace of Nymwegen, Watteau, the son of a poor\r\nFlemish tiler, was French, as it were, by accident only. In his early\r\nyears, when he studied in his native town under Gérin, a mediocre\r\nlocal painter, he must have had occasion to become closely acquainted\r\nwith the paintings of the Flemish masters. On the death of Gérin, in\r\n1702, he went to Paris, where he became assistant to the scene-painter\r\nMétayer. Watteau suffered dire poverty, and completely undermined his\r\nhealth through privation before his talent attracted the attention of\r\nhis next master, Claude Gillot, with whom he stayed until 1708, when he\r\nbecame assistant to Claude Audran, a decorative artist of great repute\r\nand Keeper of the Luxembourg collections. At the Luxembourg Palace he\r\nwas enabled to study the masterpieces of Rubens, Titian, and Paolo\r\nVeronese, from which he benefited as much as from his work from nature\r\nin the Luxembourg gardens.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps fortunate that he failed in the competition for the\r\nPrix de Rome in 1709, and was dissuaded from going to Italy. He\r\nwas received by the Academy in 1717, when he painted his “diploma\r\npicture.” _The Embarkation for the Island of Cythera_ (No. 982, Plate\r\nXXXIX.), which may be considered an epitome of his art. Sketchy as\r\nit is, this picture, which he painted in seven days, exceeds in\r\npoetic charm and in the beauty of its entrancing sparkle of mellow\r\ntones the more highly finished later version in the German Emperor’s\r\ncollection. It is the most striking instance of a purely imaginary\r\nscene of unworldly happiness, tinged with that peculiarly Watteauesque\r\nvague melancholy,—the consumptive’s _maladie de l’infini_ to which\r\nM. Mauclair has drawn attention,—represented with such absolute\r\natmospheric truth as to make it appear an incomparably beautiful\r\nreality. Technically, this picture, like _L’Indifférent_ (No. 984)\r\nand _La Finette_ (No. 985) in the La Caze Room, embodies in germ\r\nthe theories which in the second half of the next century were\r\nscientifically worked out by the French Impressionists.\r\n\r\nSome time in 1719 or 1720, Watteau was in England to consult a famous\r\nphysician. But his illness took a turn for the worse, and he had to\r\nreturn to his native country. After six months spent in Paris, he went\r\nto live at Nogent-sur-Marne, where he died on July 18, 1721. Watteau’s\r\ninfluence upon eighteenth-century art was prodigious; but his work\r\nremained unapproached by any of his followers and imitators, who too\r\noften sacrificed artistic considerations to a desire to please the\r\nlascivious tastes of a corrupt, pleasure-loving society. The _Faux Pas_\r\n(No. 989) is one of the rare instances where Watteau allowed a certain\r\nsuggestiveness to enter into his work; but even here “the smallness of\r\nthe subject is swallowed up in the greatness of the painting.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                     PLATE XXXIX.—ANTOINE WATTEAU\r\n\r\n                              (1684-1721)\r\n\r\n                             FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n          No. 982.—THE EMBARKATION FOR THE ISLAND OF CYTHERA\r\n\r\n                     (L’Embarquement pour Cythère)\r\n\r\n  On a mound in the foreground, under a group of trees on the right,\r\n  by a garlanded terminal figure of Venus, are seated a young woman\r\n  and a pilgrim; at their feet is Cupid, whose wings are covered by a\r\n  black cape.

(1·27 × 1·92.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE WATTEAUS IN THE LA CAZE GALLERY\r\n\r\nIt is a strange fact that but for the generosity of La Caze, _The\r\nEmbarkation_ would be the only example at the Louvre of the greatest\r\nmaster produced by France. The reason for this extraordinary neglect\r\nmay be found in the scant esteem in which Watteau was held until\r\nhis eclipsed fame was resuscitated by the de Goncourts. The superb\r\nlife-size painting of _Gilles_ (No. 983), one of ten pictures by or\r\nattributed to Watteau in the La Caze collection, was sold at public\r\nauction in 1826 for £26; whilst _L’Indifférent_ and _La Finette_\r\ntogether realised the sum of £19 at the Marquis de Ménars’ sale! Of\r\nthe eleven pictures in the La Caze collection that were originally\r\nattributed to Watteau, _L’Escamoteur_ (No. 622A, formerly No. 987) is\r\nnow acknowledged to be by his imitator Philippe Mercier (1689-1760),\r\nwho was born in Berlin of French parents, and spent the most productive\r\nyears of his life in London, where he died in 1760. The still-life\r\npiece _Dead Game_ (No. 993), officially assigned to Watteau, has\r\nrightly been doubted; but the aspersions thrown upon the authenticity\r\nof the delicious _Pastoral_ (No. 992) do not seem sufficiently\r\njustified. The profound influence of Rubens upon Watteau’s art is\r\nnowhere more pronounced than in the sketch _The Judgment of Paris_ (No.\r\n988), and in the beautiful oval composition _Jupiter and Antiope_ (No.\r\n991), which has, however, also much in common with Titian. The superb\r\nnude figure symbolising _Autumn_ (No. 990), and another _fête galante_,\r\nentitled _Gay Company in a Park_ (No. 986), are no less creditable to\r\nthe master’s genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WATTEAU’S FOLLOWERS\r\n\r\nAlthough Watteau indicated the direction that French art was to follow\r\nin a century when it had to cater no longer for the stateapartment but\r\nfor the boudoir, he left no follower worthy to carry on his tradition.\r\nNicolas Lancret (1690-1743), who had studied under Dulin and Gillot,\r\nbased his style upon Watteau, whom he almost rivalled as a draughtsman.\r\nBut he was an inferior colourist, and wholly lacking in poetic\r\ninspiration. One has only to compare his _Actors of the Italian Comedy_\r\n(No. 470) with Watteau’s _Gilles_ (No. 983), or his _Music Lesson_ (No.\r\n468) and _Innocence_ (No. 469) with their prototypes created by that\r\nmaster, to realise the inferiority of these thin, vulgarised versions\r\nof Watteau subjects.\r\n\r\nJean Baptiste Pater (1695-1736), who, like Watteau, was born at\r\nValenciennes, became a pupil of his fellow-townsman in Paris, and\r\nbenefited considerably by his guidance. Although inferior as a\r\ndraughtsman to Lancret, whom he did not rival either in originality, he\r\nfar surpassed him as a colourist. With Lancret, colour was generally\r\nan afterthought; with Pater, it entered into the primary conception\r\nof the picture. His Academy diploma piece, the _Fête Champêtre_ (No.\r\n689), is painted in the Watteau manner with true pictorial feeling,\r\neven if it lacks the master’s precious, jewel-like quality of pigment.\r\nThe _Fête Champêtre_ (No. 203), by Bonaventure Debar (1700-1729), holds\r\npromise of a considerable talent in a similar direction, cut short by a\r\npremature death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE VAN LOO FAMILY\r\n\r\nNo fewer than five members of the Flemish Van Loo family, which\r\nflourished in France from about 1660 until the death of Julius Cæsar\r\nVan Loo in 1821, are represented in the Louvre collection. The most\r\ndistinguished among them were Louis Van Loo’s sons, Jean-Baptiste\r\nand Charles André, better known as Carle. Both of them were brought\r\nup in the academic tradition; but their Flemish blood and the taste\r\nof a time that had seen the master-work of Watteau, gave their art\r\nmore vigour and sensuousness than is to be found in the paintings\r\nof their academic precursors. Still it is unnecessary to linger over\r\ntheir historical and mythological compositions. The picture which does\r\nmost credit to Carle Van Loo (1705-1765) is _The Hunt Picnic_ (No.\r\n899), which, in spite of a certain crudeness of colour, attracts by\r\nthe science of the composition, the Watteau feeling of the landscape\r\nbackground, and by its fascinating reality as a record of contemporary\r\nlife among the leisured, pleasure-loving classes.\r\n\r\nFrançois Le Moine (1688-1737) constitutes a link between the decorative\r\nstyle of the preceding generation, which had become dull and ponderous,\r\nand the art of Watteau and his followers. In this position he heralds\r\nhis great pupil François Boucher, whose characteristics, deprived of\r\nhis elegant grace and suave rhythm of design, are more than hinted\r\nat in the _Juno, Iris and Flora_ (No. 536). The _Olympus_ (No. 535),\r\nthe sketch for a ceiling, recalls in its joyful decorative colour and\r\nbravura of brush work the art of Tiepolo and Ricci.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FRANÇOIS BOUCHER\r\n\r\nWhilst such painters as Jean Restout (1692-1768) still continued to\r\nfollow the tradition of the Bolognese eclectics, as may be seen in\r\nhis _Herminia and the Shepherd_ (No. 775), the art of the Louis XV.\r\nperiod was given its final stamp by François Boucher (1703-1770). This\r\nfavourite of Mme. de Pompadour, having gained the Prix de Rome in 1723,\r\nwent to Italy in 1727, whence he returned to Paris four years later. At\r\nthe age of thirty his _Rinaldo and Armida_ (No. 38A) caused him to be\r\n“received” by the Academy—the first of many honours that fell to his\r\nshare, as he became in turn First Painter to the King, Director of the\r\nAcademy, and Inspector of the Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory. He was the\r\nideal painter of the age that was dominated by the personality of the\r\nPompadour, who kept him employed with commissions for the decoration\r\nof her boudoir. Boucher was the true child of his time—licentious,\r\npleasure-loving, light-hearted, and without moral scruples. The\r\nastonishing thing is that his pursuit of pleasure did not affect\r\nhis enormous productivity. His art is in perfect harmony with his\r\ncharacter—frankly sensual, exuberant, and unreliable; at times rising\r\nto superb decorative splendour of the airy, graceful type demanded by\r\nhis patrons, and then again careless to the point of slovenliness.\r\n\r\nBoucher was not a great colourist in the sense in which this term is\r\napplied to masters like Titian or Rubens. Indeed, more often than\r\nnot his application of purely local colours unaffected by their\r\nsurroundings is apt to result in the crudeness noticeable in his\r\n_Pastoral_ (No. 33), and in the domestic scene called _The Breakfast_\r\n(No. 50A). Other pictures like the _Pastoral_ (No. 34) owe their\r\npresent tapestry-like mellowness to the fading of the pigments. But\r\nit would be unfair to disregard the artist’s intention and to judge\r\nhis capacity as a colourist from the present appearance of his works\r\nat the Louvre or in their usual environment in a public gallery. They\r\nwere intended for definite decorative purposes, and in their proper\r\nLouis XV. setting fulfilled their function in admirable fashion. Few\r\nartists excelled Boucher in rhythmic harmony of composition, although\r\nit must be confessed that his emphatic insistence on triangular design\r\nis apt to become monotonous. This predilection is to be noted in the\r\n_Rinaldo and Armida_ (No. 38A), _Venus disarming Cupid_ (No. 44),\r\n_The Rape of Europa_ (No. 39), the _Pastorals_ (Nos. 33, 34, and 35),\r\n_Vulcan presenting Arms to Venus_ (No. 36, Plate XL.), and, indeed,\r\nin the vast majority of his twenty-two exhibited pictures at the\r\nLouvre. His mastery in flesh painting is best illustrated by the more\r\nunconventionally designed _Diana leaving the Bath_ (No. 30), and the\r\nbrilliant sketch of _The Three Graces_ (No. 47) in the La Caze Room.\r\nAmong his other masterpieces at the Louvre, _Venus demanding Arms from\r\nVulcan_ (No. 31), which like No. 36 was designed for execution\r\nin tapestry, and the charming _Portrait of a Young Woman_ (No. 50),\r\ndeserve special attention. It is unfortunate that they are not hung in\r\nthe rooms that contain the magnificent furniture of the period, instead\r\nof being piled sky-high among pictures that seem to be primarily\r\nregarded by the officials as mere museum specimens of the art of\r\npainting. Boucher is better hung, and so may be much more effectively\r\nstudied in the Wallace collection in London.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                      PLATE XL.—FRANÇOIS BOUCHER\r\n\r\n                              (1703-1770)\r\n\r\n                             FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                No. 36.—VULCAN PRESENTING ARMS TO VENUS\r\n\r\n           (Vulcain présentant à Vénus des Armes pour Énée)\r\n\r\n  On the right, Vulcan, seated on a tiger-skin with his left elbow\r\n  resting on an anvil, presents a sword to Venus, who, supported by a\r\n  nymph, is resting on a cloud in the centre of the composition.

BOUCHER.”\r\n\r\n  10 ft. 6 in. × 10 ft. 6 in. (3·20 × 3·20.)]\r\n\r\nA little drier in touch than Boucher’s nudes, and considerably less\r\ncoherent in design, but still painted with remarkable ability, are\r\nthe figures of the goddess and her attendants in _The Triumphs of\r\nAmphitrite_ (No. 863), by Boucher’s contemporary, Hugues Taraval\r\n(1728-1785).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SIMÉON CHARDIN\r\n\r\nIf Boucher and the army of painters of _fêtes galantes_ and boudoir\r\ndecorations reflect the tastes of the corrupt society of Louis XV.’s\r\nage, Jean-Baptiste Siméon Chardin (1699-1779) is the painter _par\r\nexcellence_ of the lower bourgeoisie. His was an uneventful, colourless\r\nlife of unremitting work after the completion of his studies under\r\nCazes and N. N. Coypel. He never went to Rome; he never sought after\r\ndistinction in the “grand manner”; he never hankered after Court\r\npatronage. He simply devoted himself to recording with the utmost\r\ntechnical perfection the peaceful and domestic life of the lower middle\r\nclass, to which he himself belonged, with all his tastes and habits\r\nof life, and to the painting of still-life, in which branch of art he\r\nstands without a rival. There are among his thirty-two pictures at the\r\nLouvre twenty paintings of _Still-life_ (Nos. 89, 90, 94, 95, 96, 98,\r\n100, 105-116, and the doubtful No. 118), all equally remarkable for\r\ntheir inimitable skill in the rendering of the most varied textures and\r\nreflections; for subtle observation of the mutual effect of coloured\r\nobjects upon each other through the interchange of coloured rays; and,\r\nabove all, for that “sense of intimacy, of life behind the scene,” with\r\nwhich he knew how to invest even inanimate objects.\r\n\r\nThis same sense of intimacy and of absolute pictorial unity is also\r\nthe great merit of his domestic genre pieces, into which enters, in\r\naddition, the element of spiritual unity, of the absorption of each\r\nperson in his or her occupation. In the deservedly famous _Grace before\r\nMeat_, at the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, of which the Louvre owns\r\ntwo admirable replicas (No. 92, Plate XLI., and No. 93), the most\r\ncasual observer cannot fail to notice that intimate bond between the\r\nmother and the two children, which gives the impression of a scene\r\naccidentally overlooked, without anybody being aware of the intruder’s\r\npresence. _La Mère laborieuse_ (No. 91), _La Pourvoyeuse_ (No. 99),\r\nand even the cat in the still-life piece _The Cat in the Larder_ (No.\r\n89), are equally innocent of “posing,” and absorbed in their respective\r\noccupations. _The Boy with the Top_ (No. 90A) and the _Young Man with\r\nthe Violin_ (No. 90B), under which titles we have the portraits of\r\nthe two children of the jeweller Charles Godefroy, were bought by the\r\nLouvre in 1907 for £14,000. These two pictures and the _Castle of\r\nCards_ (No. 103) are sufficient to establish Chardin’s supremacy in\r\nchild portraiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FRAGONARD\r\n\r\nChardin for but a few months, and Boucher for two years, were the\r\nmasters who taught Jean Honoré Fragonard (1732-1806) before, having\r\ngained the Prix de Rome in 1752 and worked three years under Van Loo,\r\nhe set out for Rome, where under Natoire’s guidance he applied himself\r\nto the copying of old masters. More important for the formation of\r\nhis style were the sketches he made in the company of his friend\r\nHubert Robert in the romantic gardens of the Villa d’Este, and the\r\ndeep impression created upon his mind by Tiepolo’s decorative\r\npaintings in Venice, which city he visited before his return to Paris\r\nin 1761. He scored his first great success in 1765 with the large and\r\nstill somewhat academic composition _Coresus and Calirrhoë_ (No. 290),\r\nwhich was bought by Louis XV. for 24,000 livres for reproduction at his\r\ntapestry works.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                PLATE XLI.—JEAN-BAPTISTE SIMÉON CHARDIN\r\n\r\n                              (1699-1779)\r\n\r\n                             FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                       No. 92.—GRACE BEFORE MEAT\r\n\r\n                            (Le Bénédicité)\r\n\r\n  In the centre of a room, by a round table with a white tablecloth,\r\n  stands a woman, about to pour the soup from a saucepan into a\r\n  plate.

(0·49 × 0·41.)]\r\n\r\nPatronised by Mme. du Barry, the dancer Marie Guimard, and other\r\npriestesses of Venus, Fragonard now devoted his exceptionally facile\r\nand spontaneous talent to subjects that in licentious frivolity,\r\nvoluptuousness, and suggestiveness had never been equalled even by his\r\nmaster Boucher. It is only his marvellous technique, ranging from the\r\nliquid transparency of his swift oil sketches to the rich luminous\r\nimpasto of the _Sleeping Bacchante_ (No. 294); from the elegant\r\narabesque of the _Bathing Women_ (No. 293), so full of _joie de vivre_\r\nand youthful fire, to the almost brutal strength of the portrait of\r\na writer or poet, known under the title of _Inspiration_ (No. 298).\r\nBut in all these, as well as in the charming _Music Lesson_ (No. 291,\r\nPlate XLII.), _The Student_ (No. 297) and the _Young Woman_ (No. 300),\r\nFragonard proves himself one of the greatest colourists produced by\r\nthe French School. It was Fragonard’s sad fate to outlive his fame, to\r\nwitness the collapse of the ancient régime and the triumph of his pupil\r\nDavid’s classicism, and to die in obscurity and neglect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GREUZE\r\n\r\nTwenty-three paintings represent at the Louvre the art of Jean-Baptiste\r\nGreuze (1725-1805), who trod the safe path of flattering the taste of\r\nthe multitude by the mawkish sentimentality of his genre-pieces and the\r\nprettiness and half-concealed sensuality of his “fancy portraits” of\r\nyoung women, which in their suggestiveness are perhaps more insidious\r\nthan the frank improprieties of Boucher and Fragonard. The sentimental\r\nand melodramatic side of Greuze’s art is strikingly revealed in _The\r\nVillage Engagement_ (No. 369), in _The Paternal Curse_ (No. 370), and\r\nin _The Punished Son_ (No. 371), which aroused the enthusiasm of that\r\nsingularly misguided critic Diderot. But it is the painting of pictures\r\nlike _The Broken Pitcher_ (No. 372, Plate XLIII.), _The Milkmaid_ (No.\r\n372A), and _The Dead Bird_ (No. 372C; a replica of the picture in the\r\nScottish National Gallery), that has made him the idol of a certain\r\nundiscriminating section of the public, and established him among the\r\nworld’s most popular painters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PORTRAIT PAINTERS\r\n\r\nThe leading position among the portrait painters of Louis XV.’s corrupt\r\nCourt was occupied by Jean Marc Nattier (1685-1766), who was a good\r\ncolourist, but was utterly lacking in sincerity, and placed his able\r\nbrush at the service of the basest flattery. He has left a whole\r\ngallery of Court beauties posing as, and invested with the attributes\r\nof, Greek goddesses and allegorical personifications in the manner of\r\nthe group of _Mdlle. de Lambesc and the Comte de Brienne_ (No. 659) as\r\nMinerva preparing the hero for warlike exploits. The _Magdalen_ (No.\r\n657) is probably another contemporary portrait in fancy costume. His\r\nbest picture at the Louvre is the _Portrait of a Young Woman_ (No.\r\n661A).\r\n\r\nFrançois Hubert Drouais (1725-1775), the painter of the group of the\r\n_Comte d’Artois (afterwards Charles X.) and Madame Clotilde, afterwards\r\nQueen of Sardinia_ (No. 266), who received a good share of Court\r\npatronage, showed considerable ability when he had sufficient strength\r\nto resist the temptation to flatter his sitters. But unfortunately he\r\ntoo often followed the example of Nattier in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TOCQUÉ, VESTIER, AND LÉPICIÉ\r\n\r\nA portrait painter of a very different stamp was Nattier’s son-in-law,\r\nLouis Tocqué (1696-1772). Although he, too, was a favourite not\r\nonly at the French, but also at the Russian and Danish Courts, the\r\nexamples of his art at the Louvre suggest that he was but indifferently\r\nsuccessful—from the artistic point of view—with his “official”\r\nportraits, like the _portrait d’apparat_ of _Marie Leczinska, Queen of\r\nLouis XV._ (No. 867), or the affected _Portrait of the Dauphin Louis at\r\nthe age of ten_ (No. 868). On the other hand, when he was not weighed\r\ndown by the importance of his task, he attained to a solidity of style,\r\nstrength of character painting, and beauty of technique that place\r\nhim at the head of the French portraitists of his period. Tocqué was\r\napparently never in England, but such masterpieces from his brush as\r\nthe _Mme. Danger embroidering_ (No. 868A), and the supposed portrait of\r\n_Mme. de Graffigny_ (No. 869), show distinct affinity with Allan Ramsay\r\nand Hogarth, with superadded French _finesse_ and suavity.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                   PLATE XLII.—JEAN HONORÉ FRAGONARD\r\n\r\n                              (1732-1806)\r\n\r\n                             FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                       No. 291.—THE MUSIC LESSON\r\n\r\n                         (La Leçon de Musique)\r\n\r\n  A fair-haired young girl in a low-cut white dress is seated, in\r\n  profile towards the right, before a spinet.

(1·10 × 1·20.)]\r\n\r\nIn the case of Antoine Vestier (1740-1824) the pronounced leaning\r\ntowards the English style of the period is to be accounted for by that\r\nartist’s lengthy sojourn in England. The _Portrait of a Young Woman_\r\n(No. 961), in the La Caze Room, might on superficial inspection pass\r\nfor a work of Francis Cotes. Even in the _Portrait of the Painter’s\r\nWife_ (No. 959), which was painted in 1787, long after Vestier’s return\r\nto his native country, the figure of a boy caressing a dog has a\r\ncuriously English flavour.\r\n\r\nHonesty of purpose and serious concern with artistic problems mark the\r\nart of Nicolas Bernard Lépicié (1735-1784), whose _Portrait of Carle\r\nVernet_ (549A) is a picture of precious quality. He devoted himself\r\nmore particularly to the domestic genre, which he treated without the\r\nsentimentality and theatricality of a Greuze. Indeed, if there is any\r\ncontemporary painter with whom he shows affinity, it is Siméon Chardin.\r\nThat he was a landscape painter of no mean ability may be gathered from\r\nhis _Farmyard_ (No. 549), which, in spite of the predominating brown,\r\nis remarkable for its luminous transparency.\r\n\r\n\r\nM^{ME.} VIGÉE LE BRUN\r\n\r\nBefore turning to the landscape painters Joseph Vernet and Hubert\r\nRobert, we must close the chapter of eighteenth-century portraiture\r\nwith Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun (1755-1842), since her art,\r\nalthough her life extended far into the nineteenth century, belongs\r\nessentially to the degenerate days of the _ancien régime_—an art not\r\ndevoid of grace, but exceeding in shallowness and insipidity the\r\nshallowest and most insipid productions of pre-Davidian days. Of the\r\nmany masters from whom Vigée, herself the daughter of a painter,\r\nreceived advice, Greuze appears to be the one with whom she was\r\nmost in sympathy. Married at an early age to Le Brun, a painter and\r\npicture-dealer from whom she was divorced after many years of wretched\r\nconjugal life, her career, of which she has left a full account in\r\nher autobiography, was one of adventure and truly extraordinary\r\nprofessional success.\r\n\r\nShe was the favourite painter of Marie Antoinette, had to leave Paris\r\nduring the Terror, and made an almost triumphal progress from Court\r\nto Court before she definitely settled in Paris in 1809. At Naples,\r\nVienna, Dresden, St. Petersburg, Berlin, London, and other centres,\r\nRoyalty and the world of fashion crowded to her studio; and her art\r\neven gained the unstinted approval of a judge like Sir Joshua Reynolds,\r\nwhich is the more surprising as Vigée Le Brun’s colour was almost\r\ninvariably cold and unsympathetic. Her personal charms may have been\r\npartly responsible for her universal success, if reliance is to be\r\nplaced on the questionable honesty of her flattering brush from which\r\nthe Louvre owns two _Portraits of the Artist and her Daughter_ (No. 521\r\nand No. 522, Plate XLIV.). Among her other pictures in the Louvre are\r\nthe _Peace bringing Abundance_ (No. 520), her reception piece at the\r\nAcademy, and a portrait of her early friend and master, _Joseph Vernet_\r\n(No. 525).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                   PLATE XLIII.—JEAN-BAPTISTE GREUZE\r\n\r\n                              (1725-1805)\r\n\r\n                      No. 372.—THE BROKEN PITCHER\r\n\r\n                          (La Cruche Cassée)\r\n\r\n  A young girl, in white dress and gauze fichu, stands facing the\r\n  spectator, holding with both hands some loose flowers in the\r\n  gathered-up folds of her dress.

(1·18 × 0·85.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOSEPH VERNET\r\n\r\nOne has to realise that the art of landscape painting had become almost\r\nextinct in France, and that the art of seascape had never existed, if\r\none wishes to account for Diderot’s enthusiasm with regard to Claude\r\nJoseph Vernet (1714-1789), which made him exclaim, “What pictures! He\r\nrivals the Creator in celerity, Nature in truth!” Our cooler judgment\r\ncannot so easily pass over all that is cold and formal in his art.\r\nBut, taken in relation to his contemporaries, he deserves respect for\r\nhis emotional attitude towards nature, for a sense of the dramatic\r\nthat approaches Salvator Rosa’s, and for his admirable drawing of the\r\nfigures introduced into his landscapes. Vernet’s love of the sea awoke\r\nwhen at the age of eighteen he journeyed to Rome, where he became\r\nimbued with the classic tradition. He only returned to Paris in 1752,\r\nand soon afterwards received from Louis XV. the commission to paint the\r\nlarge series of _French Seaports_ (Nos. 940-954) which are now to be\r\nseen in the rooms in this collection given up to the Musée de Marine.\r\nIn his other marines and landscapes (Nos. 912-939), not all of which\r\nare actually exhibited, he allowed his imagination freer play than in\r\nthe _Seaports_, which were naturally of more topographic character.\r\n\r\nBoth his son Carle Vernet (1758-1836), a historical painter who\r\nexcelled in the rendering of horses in movement, and his grandson\r\nHorace Vernet (1789-1863), a popular battle painter, are represented at\r\nthe Louvre, the former by the _Stag Hunt in the Forest of Meudon_ (No.\r\n955), and the latter by the _Barrière de Clichy (Defence of Paris in\r\n1814)_ (No. 956), and the uninspired _Judith and Holofernes_ (No. 957).\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HUBERT ROBERT\r\n\r\nHubert Robert (1733-1808), of whose classic landscapes the collection\r\ncontains nineteen examples (Nos. 797-815), was not, as might be\r\nimagined from the general character of his paintings, influenced by the\r\nart of Claude Lorrain, but derived his love of antique buildings and\r\nlandscapes peopled with classic figures from the general atmosphere of\r\narchæological enthusiasm engendered by the excavations on the site of\r\nHerculaneum, which prevailed in Rome when the young artist arrived at\r\nthat Mecca of his profession in 1754. Robert lived and worked in Italy\r\nfor twelve years, and became thoroughly imbued with this antiquarian\r\nspirit. Unlike Claude, he rarely, if ever, drew upon his imagination\r\nfor the details of his classic landscapes, which are faithful\r\ntranscripts of existing ruined or half-ruined buildings, though not\r\ninfrequently they are arranged for greater pictorial effect. Of this\r\nhalf-realistic, half-classic nature—the introduction of people in\r\nclassic garb among the ruins of buildings, which in classic times wore\r\na very different aspect, is a pardonable anachronism—are the _Interior\r\nof the Temple of Diana at Nimes_ (No. 799), and several similar pieces\r\nat the Louvre. In his smaller pictures, of which the best are the\r\n_Fountain under a Portico_ (No. 812) and the _Winding Staircase, with\r\nthree Figures_ (No. 813), in the La Caze Room, he rivals the rich\r\nquality of pigment and mellow tone of Guardi at his best. Robert was\r\nFragonard’s constant companion in Rome, and exercised considerable\r\ninfluence upon his friend, as may be seen from Fragonard’s landscape\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a trace of Italian classicism in the superb _View\r\nin the Neighbourhood of Paris_ (No. 650), by Louis Gabriel Moreau\r\n(1740-1806), which in its silvery-grey tonality, in its sense of\r\natmosphere, and in the treatment of the receding distances, rather\r\nrecalls the manner of the Dutchman Philips de Koninck. That Moreau, who\r\nalso worked in England, was not always free from conventionality, is\r\nproved by the rather formal composition of the _View of the Hills of\r\nMeudon from Saint-Cloud_ (No. 651).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n              PLATE XLIV.—ELISABETH LOUISE VIGÉE LE BRUN\r\n\r\n                              (1755-1842)\r\n\r\n           No. 522.—PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AND HER DAUGHTER\r\n\r\n               (Portrait de Mme.

(1·05 x 0·85.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LOUIS DAVID\r\n\r\nThe boudoir art of the _ancien régime_ came to a natural end through\r\nthe great social upheaval of the Revolution, of which Jacques Louis\r\nDavid (1748-1825) is the very personification in the realm of painting.\r\nAs a pupil of Boucher, David in his early years was essentially a child\r\nof the eighteenth century. That he became the founder and head of a\r\nnew classicist school, as tyrannical in his sway as had been Le Brun\r\nduring the reign of Louis XIV., was due to the teaching of Joseph Marie\r\nVien, whom he accompanied to Rome in 1775, the year in which Vien was\r\nappointed Director of the École de Rome. Vien was an eclectic and a\r\npurist of greater ability than would appear from his two dull pictures\r\nat the Louvre, _St. Germain and St. Vincent_ (No. 964) and _The\r\nSleeping Hermit_ (No. 965).\r\n\r\nDavid’s participation in the events of the year 1789 and his ardent\r\nrepublicanism did not, as has often been stated, attract him to\r\nsubjects from Republican Roman history. Indeed, he had already painted\r\n_The Oath of the Horatii_ (No. 189) and _The Lictors taking to Brutus\r\nthe Corpse of his Sons_ (No 191), for Louis XVI., and was only\r\nfollowing the current of taste in devoting himself to the study of the\r\nantique and to antiquarian research. These two pictures, in spite of\r\ntheir cold classicism and theatricality, met with sensational success\r\non their first appearance at the Salon. It is not in such works as\r\nthese, nor in the _Rape of the Sabine Women_ (No. 188), compared with\r\nwhich even Poussin’s version of the same theme appears like a glimpse\r\nof actual life, that David’s talent found its happiest expression, but\r\nin the unaffected and irresistibly charming _Portrait of Mme. Récamier_\r\n(No. 199, Plate XLV.) reclining on an Empire sofa. Whatever this\r\npicture may owe to the sitter’s grace and beauty and to the fact that\r\nit was never finished, and thus retained the freshness of a sketch,\r\nit is certainly one of the most attractive masterpieces of the French\r\nschool. Here, as in the group of _Three Ladies of Ghent_ (No. 200A),\r\nin which the luminous quality of the fresh tones is enhanced by the\r\ngeneral greyness of the scheme, we have the work of a real painter,\r\nwhilst David’s bombastic historical compositions are scarcely more than\r\ntinted cartoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE “CORONATION” PICTURE\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon rose to power, David became his favourite painter. The\r\nerstwhile Jacobin was chosen to paint the official _Coronation_ picture\r\n(No. 202A), an enormous canvas, which, like most ceremonial pictures of\r\nthis kind, has more historical than artistic significance. The lifelike\r\nportraiture of the numerous personages surrounding the central group of\r\nNapoleon placing the crown on Josephine’s head, is the chief point of\r\ninterest. On the restoration of the Bourbons in 1815, David was sent\r\ninto exile. He died at Brussels in 1825; but his influence is reflected\r\nin official French art to this day. It was he who imposed upon the\r\nmodern academic school a rigid canon of formal classic beauty which is\r\nfatal to evolution and progress, because it does not permit personal\r\nemotional expression.\r\n\r\nLess severely classic in form, and showing at least an attempt at\r\napproaching a little nearer to truth than David, is the painting of\r\nthe figures of _The Three Graces_ (No. 769), by David’s rival, J.\r\nB. Regnault (1754-1829), in the La Caze collection. The worst type\r\nof academic art is represented in the bituminous reconstructions of\r\nclassic antiquity by his pupil, P. N. Guérin (1774-1833), whose _Return\r\nof Marcus Sextus_ (No. 393) enjoyed, perhaps owing to its supposed\r\npolitical allusion to the return of the emigrants, a success which\r\ncannot be accounted for on artistic grounds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                    PLATE XLV.—JACQUES LOUIS DAVID\r\n\r\n                              (1748-1825)\r\n\r\n                  No. 199.—PORTRAIT OF MME.

(1·70 × 2·40.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BARON GÉRARD\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous pupils and followers of David who rose to fame,\r\nhonours, and wide popularity before Ingres became the acknowledged\r\nhead of the official school, the most distinguished were Gérard,\r\nGirodet, and Gros. Baron F. P. S. Gérard (1770-1837), whilst following\r\non the whole the principles laid down by his master, knew how to\r\ninvest his work with more individual character, which stood him in\r\nparticular good stead in his portraiture. That this was recognised\r\nby his contemporaries is proved by the fact that he became the\r\nportrait painter _par excellence_ of the First Empire and the Bourbon\r\nrestoration, although his inclination drew him towards allegory and\r\nmythology. There is undeniable distinction and fine characterisation\r\nin such portraits as _The Painter Isabey and his Daughter_ (No. 332).\r\nThe nature of the subject debarred him from showing the strongest side\r\nof his talent in the chillingly unemotional, but undeniably graceful,\r\n_Psyche receiving Cupid’s First Kiss_ (No. 328), and in the _Daphnis\r\nand Chloë_ (No. 329), which was bought in 1825 for £1000. They have\r\ntheir counterpart in the cold and antique French sculpture of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nA. L. Girodet de Roucy-Trioson (1767-1824) was of all David’s artistic\r\nprogeny the one painter who devoted himself to the purely pictorial\r\nproblem of concentrated light and shade, without, however, being able\r\nto free himself from the domination of linear design. The compromise\r\nof the two principles led to such unfortunate results as _The Sleep\r\nof Endymion_ (No. 361) and _The Burial of Atala_ (No. 362). In _The\r\nDeluge_ (No. 360), which was painted later, he shows pronounced\r\nleanings towards a crude naturalism which exceeds in horror the most\r\ncruel inventions of Ribera’s genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BARON GROS\r\n\r\nAntoine Jean Gros (1771-1835), though a classicist by training, was\r\nforced by circumstances, and by the patronage of Napoleon who ennobled\r\nhim, to devote his brush to an important phase of contemporary life—the\r\nglorification of his hero’s warlike achievements. He was by no means a\r\nrealist; and although he followed Napoleon on many of his campaigns and\r\npresumably brought back with him rich material in sketches and vivid\r\nrecollections, his forceful compositions accentuate the heroic aspect\r\nand the imaginative appeal of warfare, and are not spontaneous glimpses\r\nof actuality. The whole glamour of the Napoleonic legend is expressed\r\nin the group of wounded soldiers who, oblivious of their suffering,\r\ncheer their great captain in _Napoleon at the Battle of Eylau_ (No.\r\n389). The sense of the heroic is as pronounced in the large painting,\r\n_Napoleon visiting the Plague-stricken at Jaffa_ (No. 388), in the\r\n_Bonaparte at Arcole_ (No. 391), and even in the impressive _Portrait\r\nof Lieutenant-General Fournier-Sarlovèze_ (No. 392A), silhouetted\r\nagainst a smoke-filled battlefield. A careful inspection of this large\r\ncanvas shows _pentimenti_ in the painting of the legs, of which the\r\nGeneral seems now to have two pair! Gros’s weakness, like that of all\r\nDavid’s pupils, was his neglect of colour. His popularity waned rapidly\r\nafter the fall of Napoleon. He became a victim to melancholia, and\r\ndrowned himself in the Seine in 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PIERRE PRUD’HON\r\n\r\nThough not entirely detached from the ruling school of the period,\r\nPierre Prud’hon (1758-1823) occupies a unique position among his\r\ncontemporaries. Having absolved his preliminary studies at Dijon, he\r\nbecame the pupil of the old masters—of Correggio and Leonardo—first\r\nin Paris and then in Rome, where he worked for seven years before\r\ndefinitely settling at Paris in 1789. To his sympathy with the\r\nItalian masters he owed that mellowness of colour and understanding\r\nof chiaroscuro which escaped the grasp of the Davidists. He was a\r\nreal _painter_ as distinguished from the classicist _draughtsmen_ of\r\nthe official school. Even if it is impossible to share to-day the\r\nenthusiasm at one time evoked by the somewhat grotesque allegory,\r\n_Justice and Divine Vengeance pursuing Crime_ (No. 747), this picture,\r\nwhich was intended for the Palais de Justice, rises immeasurably above\r\nthe average of the “imaginative” paintings produced by Prud’hon’s\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nVastly superior as regards pictorial quality and the whole conception,\r\nis the _Abduction of Psyche by Zephyrus_ (No. 756). In the\r\n_Crucifixion_ (No. 744), his last picture, Prud’hon rises to telling\r\ndramatic effectiveness of colour, and heralds the advent of Delacroix.\r\nBut the most masterly of his seventeen paintings at the Louvre is the\r\nmagnificent _Portrait of a Young Man_ (No. 753), which the Louvre was\r\nfortunate enough to secure for £35 in 1895. It is a strangely living\r\nevocation of a personality, searching, intimate, and mysterious—a\r\nportrait not so much of the superficial features, but of the inner life\r\nof the sitter. The large _Portrait of the Empress Joséphine_ (No. 751)\r\nsuffers from comparison with this masterpiece. The pose is affected,\r\nthe background dingy, and the red of the shawl introduces a harsh and\r\ndisconnected note of colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GÉRICAULT\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary movement of the Romanticists, which was to find a\r\nstrong leader in Eugène Delacroix, may be said to have been initiated\r\nby Géricault’s epoch-making picture _The Raft of the Medusa_ (No. 338,\r\nPlate XLVI.). Théodore Géricault (1791-1824), a pupil of Carle Vernet\r\nand Guérin, was an unusually gifted draughtsman, who from the outset\r\nstrove to go beyond the dead perfection of the David school, and to\r\ninfuse into his work the spark of life. The _Raft of the Medusa_, which\r\ncaused an enormous stir at the Salon of 1819, was inspired by a tragic\r\nincident from actual life; and Géricault was the first who dared to\r\nrepresent in all its horrible reality this scene of human suffering—the\r\nsurvivors of a shipwreck driven by hunger to madness and mutual\r\ndestruction. He set aside all arbitrarily ignored canons of formal\r\nbeauty and the “grand style,” and applied himself to depicting fierce\r\npassions and emotions.\r\n\r\nGéricault was a passionate lover of horses; but his knowledge of equine\r\nanatomy did not prevent him, in his portrait of an _Officer of the\r\nGuard_ (No. 339), from exaggerating the action of the charging horse to\r\na point dangerously near the border-line between the sublime and the\r\nridiculous. Most of his other pictures at the Louvre are studies of\r\nsoldiers, and horses on the race-course or in the stable. He died in\r\n1824 from the effects of a fall from a horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DELACROIX\r\n\r\nThe topical interest of the _Raft of the Medusa_ had caused the public\r\nto receive this picture with favour, in spite of its daring departure\r\nfrom the generally accepted canons of the “grand style.” The case was\r\ndifferent when Delacroix showed at the Salon of 1822 the _Dante and\r\nVirgil_ (No. 207, Plate XLVII.), which was inspired by Géricault’s\r\ngreat picture, but applied that artist’s principles to a subject taken\r\nfrom literature,—from Dante’s “Inferno,”—and was therefore considered\r\nas a direct challenge to the academic host. To-day it is difficult to\r\nunderstand the indignation aroused by the young artist, who became\r\nforthwith the acknowledged head of the so-called Romanticist school,\r\nalthough he refrained from taking part in any propaganda. In this,\r\nhis first important exhibited picture, he proved himself a true\r\npainter in the sense in which Rubens was a painter—that is to say,\r\nhe no longer gave primary importance to drawing, with colour added\r\nafterwards in the manner of a tinted cartoon. In the _Dante and Virgil_\r\ncolour and the actual sweep of the brush assumed at once a vital and\r\nconstructive function, no longer separable from drawing and design.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n            PLATE XLVI.—JEAN LOUIS ANDRÉ THÉODORE GÉRICAULT\r\n\r\n                              (1791-1824)\r\n\r\n                    No. 338.—THE RAFT OF THE MEDUSA\r\n\r\n                       (Le Radeau de la Méduse)\r\n\r\n  The raft of the wrecked Medusa, with the survivors of the crew,\r\n  is floating on the stormy sea.

(4·91 × 7·16.)]\r\n\r\nEugène Delacroix (1798-1863), who belonged to a family that had given\r\nto France many distinguished statesmen and soldiers, was a pupil\r\nof Guérin, whose conventional teaching, however, was little to the\r\ntaste of a young man whose passionate nature had been fired by his\r\nextensive reading of romantic literature, and who preferred to form\r\nhis style on the works of Rubens and other old masters at the Louvre,\r\nand to benefit from his intercourse with Géricault and Bonington. The\r\n_Dante and Virgil_, which is now in a deplorable state of neglect, was\r\nbought by the State at the not very generous price of £50. Delacroix’s\r\nnext Salon picture, _The Massacre of Scio_ (No. 208), caused an even\r\ngreater storm of abuse of the young artist who had dared to depict the\r\nhorrors of this scene from the Greek War of Independence, as it was\r\nthought, in all their crudeness, without the heroical and theatrical\r\nposes that were deemed necessary for pictorial “histories.” The\r\nmagnificent atmospheric background owes its origin to Delacroix’s\r\nfirst acquaintance with the _Hay Wain_ and two other pictures sent by\r\nConstable to the Salon of 1824, which caused the impetuous young artist\r\nto repaint in a few days the sky and landscape. The picture was again\r\nbought by the State, the price this time being raised to £240. A superb\r\nstudy for the dead mother and child in the right-hand corner has been\r\nbequeathed by M. Cheramy, the present owner, to the National Gallery,\r\nwhere it is to be hung next to “the best Constable.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to give a full account of the twenty-one\r\npaintings by Delacroix at the Louvre, to which should be added his\r\ndecorative masterpiece, the centre of the ceiling in the Galerie\r\nd’Apollon. We must content ourselves with a brief reference to his\r\nmore important canvases, first of which in order of date is _The 28th\r\nof July 1830: Liberty leading the People_ (No. 209), better known as\r\n_The Barricade_. The introduction of a bourgeois with a top-hat in this\r\nstirring scene of contemporary heroism was another act of defiance.\r\nBut the dramatic power of the conception, which suffers but is by no\r\nmeans destroyed by the wretched allegorical figure of Liberty, and\r\nthe artist’s appeal to political passion, caused the picture to be an\r\nenormous success.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DELACROIX’S ORIENTAL PICTURES\r\n\r\nDelacroix’s journey to Morocco, with Count Morney’s mission in 1832,\r\nwas of the greatest benefit to the artist’s progress as a colourist.\r\nAlthough he had no time during his travels to paint any pictures, he\r\nbrought back with him a wealth of rapid sketches which, with his vivid\r\nrecollections of Eastern life and colour, led to the production of such\r\nmasterpieces as the _Algerian Women in their Apartment_ (No. 210), the\r\n_Jewish Wedding in Morocco_ (No. 211), and _The Entry of the Crusaders\r\ninto Constantinople_ (No. 213). In the sumptuous scheme of _Crusaders_\r\nthe last traces of the influence of Gros’s colourless palette have\r\nvanished. The picture was commissioned by Louis Philippe for the\r\nChâteau at Versailles, the remuneration being fixed at £400. A copy of\r\nthe picture is in one of the Salles des Croisades at Versailles, and\r\na small sketch is at Chantilly. The _Algerian Women_ is particularly\r\nremarkable for the luminous sparkle of rich pigment through the ambient\r\nof silvery atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAmong Delacroix’s masterpieces must be counted the _Portrait of\r\nthe Artist_ (No. 214), which he left on his death to his servant,\r\nJenny le Guillon, stipulating that she should give it to the Louvre\r\non the day of the restoration of the Orléans family—an event which\r\nnever happened, though the picture reached its destination in 1872\r\nthrough the generosity of Mme. Durien. _The Shipwreck of Don Juan_ (No.\r\n212), painted in 1840, is based on Lord Byron’s epic poem, of which\r\nit is, however, by no means a literal illustration. It is one of the\r\nmost stirring renderings of human passion and despair in the whole\r\nhistory of art, the livid light and general sombre scheme of colour\r\ncontributing towards the tragic effect, as though Nature herself were\r\nentering into the mood of the horrible scene.\r\n\r\nAlthough, on the whole, an unsatisfactory picture, Delacroix’s _Roger\r\ndelivering Angelica_ (No. 2845) may serve to illustrate the true\r\nsignificance of his art in its relation to the official school, as\r\nthere is in the same collection another rendering of the identical\r\nsubject (No. 419) by his great antagonist Ingres, the greatest\r\ndraughtsman of his century, and the acknowledged leader of the\r\nClassicist school. Comparison between the two works will show that\r\nDelacroix’s version, with all its obvious imperfections, far surpasses\r\nIngres’s in emotional intensity and fierce vitality. The academic\r\nperfection and exquisite finish of Ingres’s picture only accentuate the\r\ndulness and lifelessness of his conception.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n            PLATE XLVII.—FERDINAND VICTOR EUGÈNE DELACROIX\r\n\r\n                              (1798-1863)\r\n\r\n                       No. 207.—DANTE AND VIRGIL\r\n\r\n                     (Dante et Virgile aux Enfers)\r\n\r\n  In a boat, steered by Charon across the river Styx, Virgil,\r\n  laurel-crowned and dressed in a red cloak, holds with his right\r\n  hand the left hand of Dante, who, in a blue cloak with a red\r\n  hood, raises his right arm in a gesture of horror at the sight\r\n  of the Damned, who, half-buried in the turbulent waters, cling\r\n  despairingly to the sides of the boat.

(1·80 × 2·40.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INGRES\r\n\r\nJean Auguste Dominique Ingres (1780-1867) was a pupil of David. Having\r\ngained the Prix de Rome in 1801, he did not leave for Italy until 1806,\r\nbut spent the next eighteen years in Rome and Florence, returning to\r\nParis in 1824. Although Ingres was brought up in the cold tradition\r\nof the David school, he had a much clearer perception of the true\r\nspirit of Greek art than his master. When he became acquainted with\r\nthe work of Raphael in Rome, he found it the very acme of perfection,\r\nand henceforth frankly strove to emulate that master, seeking to\r\narrive at an eclectic ideal of the human form which in its dogmatic\r\nrule of the proportions that constitute absolute beauty, allowed none\r\nof the accents and variations which make for life and character.\r\nHimself greater than his theories, Ingres achieved that perfection\r\nof grace and beauty in his deservedly famous _The Spring_ (No. 422,\r\nPlate XLVIII.), one of the few “gems” in the Salle Duchâtel, and in\r\nthe very Raphaelesque _Odalisque_ (No. 422B), which was purchased in\r\n1899 from the Princesse de Sagan for £2400. On the other hand, the\r\nimposition of an inflexible, rigid ideal of form did incalculable harm\r\nto his numerous and less gifted followers, in whom every spark of\r\nindividuality was extinguished by the tyranny of the dogma.\r\n\r\nYet Ingres, when he applied himself to portraiture, was as\r\nuncompromising a realist as Holbein, of whose sensitive, subtle drawing\r\nand plastic modelling, without the introduction of entirely unnecessary\r\nshiny high lights, we are forcibly reminded by the _Portrait of\r\nthe Painter’s Friend, M. Bochet_ (No. 428A). Something of the same\r\nperfection of modelling, suggested rather by the sensitive contour than\r\nclearly stated by pronounced lights and shadows, is to be noticed in\r\nthe nude figure of _The Odalisque_, and in the creamy white drapings\r\nof the oval _Portrait of Mme. Rivière_ (No. 427). Perhaps his best\r\nportrait at the Louvre is the one of _M. Bertin, Founder of the Journal\r\ndes Débats_ (No. 428B), a masterpiece of character painting, in which\r\nthe marvellously drawn fleshy hands, with their tapering fingers, are\r\nas expressive as the fine head. This portrait was acquired in 1897 for\r\nthe sum of £3200.\r\n\r\nThe less admirable side of Ingres’s talent is illustrated by the\r\ncircular composition of the _Virgin of the Host_ (No. 416), a\r\ncrude scheme of “Sassoferrato blue” and red, on entirely conventional\r\nlines; and by the _Apotheosis of Homer_ (No. 417), a tame Raphaelesque\r\ndesign in which Homer is seen enthroned in the centre, with allegorical\r\nfigures of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ seated on the steps of the throne,\r\nand a winged goddess placing a laurel wreath on his head. To the left\r\nof the central group are the figures of Hesiod, Æschylus, Apelles,\r\nRaphael, Virgil, Dante, Tasso, Corneille, and Poussin; to the right,\r\nPindar, Plato, Socrates, Alexander, Camoens, Racine, Molière, and\r\nFénelon. There is a touch of the grotesque in the combination of rather\r\nmechanical dry portraiture with trite allegory that constitutes the\r\ndesign of the terribly cracked _Portrait of the Composer Cherubini_\r\n(No. 418). His failings as a colourist are most aggressively obvious in\r\nthe _Christ handing the Keys to St. Peter_ (No. 415). Ingres died in\r\nParis on the 14th January 1867.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n              PLATE XLVIII.—JEAN AUGUSTE DOMINIQUE INGRES\r\n\r\n                              (1780-1867)\r\n\r\n                          No. 422.—THE SPRING\r\n\r\n                              (La Source)\r\n\r\n  A nude figure of a fair-haired young maiden stands facing the\r\n  spectator, the background being formed by a perpendicular rock\r\n  partly overgrown with clinging plants.

(1.65 × 0.80.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DELAROCHE AND SCHEFFER\r\n\r\nAmong the painters who were influenced by Delacroix, and whose name was\r\nassociated with the Romanticist movement, none rose to greater fame\r\nthan Paul Delaroche (1797-1856), a pupil of Gros, and the Dutchman Ary\r\nScheffer (1795-1858), who, like Delacroix, studied under Guérin. But\r\nneither of these artists managed wholly to shake off the trammels of\r\nthe academic tradition, and both became popular for the very reasons\r\nfor which a more critical generation has denied them the right to\r\nfigure among the world’s great artists: Delaroche for the theatricality\r\nof his historical anecdotes, of which _The Death of Queen Elizabeth_\r\n(No. 216) and _The Princes in the Tower_ (No. 217) are typical\r\nexamples; and Scheffer for the sickly sentimentality displayed in such\r\npictures as _St. Augustine and St. Monica_ (No. 841).\r\n\r\nContemporary with the fighters in the great battle between the\r\nRomanticists and the Classicists were a group of able painters who were\r\nnot connected with either of these main currents of artistic thought,\r\nbut drew their inspiration from the Dutch genre painters. _The Arrival\r\nof a Diligence at the Messageries_ (No. 28), by Louis Leopold Boilly\r\n(1761-1845), and _The Interior of a Kitchen_ (No. 261), by Martin\r\nDrolling (1752-1817), may be quoted as characteristic instances of\r\nthese “small masters” without possessing the luminosity of their Dutch\r\nexemplars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DECAMPS\r\n\r\nSomething of the precious quality of pigment and of the luminosity\r\nof these Dutchmen is to be found in the genre pictures of Alexandre\r\nGabriel Decamps (1803-1860), of which a large number form part of\r\nthe Thomy Thiéry Bequest—notably _The Knife-Grinder_ (No. 2831)\r\nand _The Gipsy Encampment_ (No. 2833). Decamps owes his historical\r\nimportance to his position as the head of the Orientalists. Unlike his\r\ncontemporary explorer of the East for pictorial purposes, Delacroix,\r\nhe found the facts of Eastern life, scenery, and customs sufficiently\r\nattractive to be satisfied with the realistic statement of his visual\r\nimpressions, instead of making them the basis for the invention of\r\nromantic incidents. Yet the _Street in Smyrna_ (No. 2827) and similar\r\nworks are by no means of merely topographic interest, for Decamps was\r\na great painter to whom pigment yielded beauty independent of the\r\nsubject represented. _The Rat retired from the World_ (No. 2834) vies\r\nin quality with the still-life pictures of Chardin. Decamps was also\r\nthe greatest animal painter of his time, as may be gathered from his\r\n_Chevaux de halage_ (No. 204), _The Bull-Dog and Scotch Terrier_ (No.\r\n206), and the precious little genre piece, _The Kennel-Boy_ (No. 2838).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ORIENTALISTS\r\n\r\nBrought up in the tradition of the Classicist school, Prosper Marilhat\r\n(1811-1847) only “formed himself” when the world of colour was\r\ndiscovered to him under the glowing sky of the Holy Land and Egypt,\r\nwhere he painted _The Mosque of the Khalif Hakem, at Cairo_ (No.\r\n615). Another Orientalist of great distinction, who, after being a\r\nfavourite pupil of Ingres, became attracted by the fiery romanticism\r\nof Delacroix, was the Creole Théodore Chassériau (1819-1856). His\r\nworks at the Louvre illustrate the earlier better than the later phase\r\nof his art. Chassériau was still entirely under the spell of Ingres\r\nwhen he painted, in 1844, the decoration of the Cour des Comptes,\r\nwhich building was destroyed under the Commune. _Peace_ (No. 121A) is\r\na fragment of this important decorative work, which may be said to\r\nconstitute a link between Ingres and Puvis de Chavannes. _The Chaste\r\nSusannah_ (No. 121) and the _Portrait of Father Lacordaire, Dominican\r\nPreacher_ (No. 121B), are again clear evidence of Ingres’s influence\r\nupon Chassériau at the beginning of his brief career.\r\n\r\nA man of profound culture and rare critical acumen, Eugène Fromentin\r\n(1820-1876) was perhaps greater as a critic than as a painter. He, too,\r\ntravelled repeatedly in Algeria and Egypt, where he found abundant\r\nmaterial both for his brush and pen. He did not look upon the East\r\nwith the curiosity of the traveller, nor did he let the strange land\r\nwork upon his romantic imagination. His pictures, somewhat timid in\r\ntechnique but marked by great refinement, reveal, on the other hand, a\r\nthorough understanding of the sad monotony of the sun-parched desert,\r\nand the chivalrous, noble bearing of its Arab inhabitants. His refined\r\ntalent shows to best advantage in _Hawking in Algeria_ (No. 305).\r\n\r\n\r\n                               REGNAULT\r\n\r\nThe Orient was by no means the uncontested field of the Romanticists.\r\nBut the followers of the official school who devoted themselves to\r\nthe depicting of Eastern life and scenery, approached these subjects\r\nin the same spirit of _parti pris_ which robs all their work of real\r\nsignificance—unless, like Henri Regnault (1843-1871) in his famous\r\nand often reproduced _Moorish Execution_ (No. 771), they treated them\r\nas rank melodrama. Regnault is, however, not to be judged by this\r\noverrated piece of sensationalism. Killed in the Franco-German War in\r\n1871 at the early age of twenty-eight, this young painter gave rare\r\npromise of brilliant achievement in an altogether unacademic direction\r\nin his superb equestrian portrait of _General Prim_ (No. 770). There is\r\nsomething truly heroic in the way the Spanish general sits his horse,\r\narresting its forward movement with a sudden jerk at the reins; but\r\nthe ruggedness and unkempt appearance of the rider displeased General\r\nPrim to such an extent that Regnault, who would not alter the picture,\r\npreferred to keep it on his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ACADEMIC PAINTERS\r\n\r\nIt will suffice here merely to indicate the names and chief works at\r\nthe Louvre of the principal artists who carried on, about the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century, the academic tradition,—capable painters all,\r\nbut without clearly-marked individuality. Thomas Couture (1815-1879),\r\na pupil of Gros and of Delaroche, in painting the huge composition,\r\n_Romans of the Decadence_ (No. 156), produced a picture which may be\r\ntaken as typical of the ambitions and failings of the whole school—of\r\ntheir literary tendencies, theatricality, and uninspired dulness. He\r\nwas, however, an accomplished master of technique, which is more than\r\ncan be said of Joseph Devéria (1805-1865), the painter of _The Birth\r\nof Henri IV._ (No. 250); or of Ingres’s pupil, the dull Hippolyte\r\nFlandrin (1809-1864), who is only represented by two _Portraits_ (Nos.\r\n284 and 285). Nor is it possible to-day to grow enthusiastic over the\r\nhistorical paintings of Joseph Nicolas Robert-Fleury (1797-1890), whose\r\n_Conference at Poissy_ (No. 2982), _Galileo before the Inquisition_\r\n(No. 2983), and _Christopher Columbus received by Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella on his Return from America_ (No. 2984), can only be regarded\r\nas unnecessarily large coloured illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MICHEL AND HUET\r\n\r\nIn the much-neglected branch of landscape painting the classic\r\ntradition of Claude ruled supreme until a new conception arose with\r\nthe victory of the romantics in the third decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Two names only need be mentioned before we pass on to the\r\nnew movement—the return to nature—which was inaugurated by the group\r\nof painters vaguely known as the Barbizon school. Both Georges Michel\r\n(1763-1843) and Paul Huet (1804-1868) may be regarded as forerunners\r\nof that great movement; and both have only in recent years received\r\nthe recognition which is their due. Michel developed his style in\r\ncopying and closely studying the Dutch landscape masters, and must\r\nin his maturity have been well acquainted with the art of Constable,\r\nwho exercised, together with Bonington, a prodigious influence on the\r\nwhole course of French landscape painting. If Michel’s breadth of\r\nstyle, which may be judged from _Near Montmartre_ (No. 626), had been\r\naccompanied by a greater range of subject-matter, he would probably\r\nrank more highly in the roll of French artists; but he contented\r\nhimself with the endless repetition of the same motifs which he found\r\nclose to Montmartre, where he spent his whole life. The care with which\r\nhe studied the works of Jacob van Ruisdael earned for him the nickname\r\nof “the Ruisdael of Montmartre.”\r\n\r\nHuet, again, learnt more from the old masters and from his friends,\r\nBonington and Delacroix, than from his actual teachers. He, too,\r\nthrust aside the recipes of composing classic or “noble” landscapes,\r\nand was inspired by an altogether emotional outlook upon nature, calm\r\nand serene, as in _The Still Morning_ (No. 413), or threatening and\r\ntempestuous, as in _The Inundation at St. Cloud_ (No. 412), or in his\r\nmasterpiece, _The Breakers at Granville_ (No. 2952).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE BARBIZON SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThe term “Barbizon school” has been extended from its narrower meaning,\r\nin which it merely comprises Rousseau, Diaz, Millet and the disciples\r\nwho joined them, to form a little artistic colony on the edge of the\r\nForest of Fontainebleau, to a less accurate but now generally accepted\r\nwider application, embracing “the men of 1830,” who collectively and\r\nindividually set out, inspired indirectly by Constable, upon the\r\nconquest of light and atmosphere through intimate communion with\r\nnature. In a pedantic survey of this Barbizon school, Rousseau would\r\nhave to take honour of place as the leader of the group, whilst Corot\r\nand Daubigny, neither of whom actually worked at Barbizon, would have\r\nto be altogether excluded. But in the more liberal interpretation of\r\nthe term, which we have here adopted, Jean Baptiste Camille Corot\r\n(1796-1875) must be given first place as the doyen of the whole group,\r\nsince he alone was born before the eighteenth century had run its\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 COROT\r\n\r\nCorot, the son of a _coiffeur_ and a _modiste_ in comfortable\r\ncircumstances, was destined in his youth for the drapery trade, and\r\nwas only enabled to follow his bent for the artistic profession when,\r\nat the age of twenty-five, he entered into possession of a small\r\nannual allowance, sufficient to meet his modest requirements and to\r\nsave him from the desperate struggle for very existence which was the\r\nfate of some of his later friends and companions. His early work from\r\nnature had already laid the foundations for his subsequent style when\r\nhe entered the studio, first of the academic painter Michallon, and\r\nthen of Bertin. In 1825 Corot went to Rome, where he painted, among\r\nmany pictures of equally rich luscious quality, the _View of the Forum\r\nRomanum_ (No. 139), and the _View of the Coliseum_ (No. 140), which\r\nhe himself bequeathed to the State. Although these early works have\r\nnone of the elusive charm and lyrical feeling of his mature style,\r\nand are of rather topographic character, they reveal in every touch\r\nthe artist enamoured of atmosphere and of the quality of pigment. The\r\ntouch is precise, but not tight. The two pictures were painted in 1826,\r\nbut already they hold more than a hint of that unrivalled mastery of\r\ntone-values which found supreme expression in _A Street in Douai_ (No.\r\n141F), painted in 1871.\r\n\r\nFrom the precision of his early manner Corot gradually advanced to\r\nfreedom and airy looseness of touch; from statement of fact, to the\r\nsuggestion of the very spirit and essence of nature in terms of paint\r\nthat, more than any other artist’s work, justify the expression\r\n“colour music.” His later canvases are filled with the soft shimmer\r\nof vibrating atmosphere and with the tender poetry of dawn and dusk.\r\nWhilst retaining a truly classic sense of style, and adapting nature\r\nto his purposes by arrangement and generalisation, he never fails to\r\nconvince the beholder of the reality of the scene represented. Even\r\nif his glades are peopled with dancing nymphs and satyrs, as in _A\r\nMorning_ (No. 138), these mythical beings no longer suggest classic\r\nstatuary, but they belong as much to the landscape as do the trees\r\nand shrubs and clouds, as do the peasant woman and the cow in _The\r\nDell_ (No. 2801, Plate XLIX.), or the piping shepherd in the exquisite\r\n_Souvenir d’Italie: Castel Gandolfo_ (No. 141B). Of the twenty-two\r\npaintings by the master at the Louvre, no fewer than twelve form\r\npart of the Thomy Thiéry Bequest to which the great French national\r\ncollection owes so many of its chief treasures of nineteenth-century\r\nart.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              T. ROUSSEAU\r\n\r\nThe real head of the Barbizon school was Théodore Rousseau (1812-1867),\r\nwho was one of the first exponents of the “romantic” as opposed to the\r\n“classic” landscape. If Corot was the lyric, Rousseau was the epic\r\npoet of Nature. In his early works he was considerably influenced\r\nby Constable, but he failed for a long time to gain the approval of\r\nthe public and of the Salon juries. Fourteen times in succession his\r\npictures were refused admission to the Salon, and success only came to\r\nhim late in life. In 1851, at about the same time as Millet, he settled\r\nat Barbizon, on the outskirts of the Forest of Fontainebleau, where\r\nhenceforth he found the subjects for his pictures. Rousseau was a most\r\nconscientious artist, who “constructed a group of trees with the care\r\nthat an Academician puts into the construction of a nude figure.” His\r\nlove of accurate detail did not, however, make him lose sight of the\r\ngeneral effect. His insistence on bold silhouettes made him favour the\r\nsunset hour when, as in his masterpiece, _An Opening in the Forest at\r\nFontainebleau_ (No. 827), the trees would form effective dark masses\r\nagainst the glowing sunset sky. More characteristic of his favourite\r\nmanner of composition is the imposing group of oak trees in the middle\r\nof a plain in the picture known as _Les Chênes_ (No. 2900). In this,\r\nas in _Marais dans les Landes_ (No. 830), which was bought in 1881 for\r\n£5160, and, indeed, in all the pictures where cattle are introduced,\r\nit will be noticed that the animals form part and parcel of the\r\nlandscape, and are no longer individual “portraits” of animals, as they\r\nwere apt to be in the pictures by the earlier Dutch cattle-painters.\r\nThe same unity of vision is to be noted in all his sixteen pictures at\r\nthe Louvre.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                PLATE XLIX.—JEAN-BAPTISTE CAMILLE COROT\r\n\r\n                              (1796-1875)\r\n\r\n                          No. 2801.—THE DELL\r\n\r\n             (Le Vallon, avec des paysannes et une vache)\r\n\r\n  A grass-covered hill descends from the horizon line on the left\r\n  to the right-hand bottom corner of the picture. A low hedge with\r\n  a clump of trees in the centre divides the grassy plot from the\r\n  field rising beyond towards the horizon-line, from which projects\r\n  a church in the far distance. The sun is behind the trees, which\r\n  throw a deep shadow on the dale. A cow occupies the centre of the\r\n  foreground.

(0·35 × 0·54.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               C. TROYON\r\n\r\nThis oneness of inanimate and animate nature is less completely\r\nrealised in the art of Constant Troyon (1810-1865), who, having been\r\ntrained as a porcelain-painter, was subsequently attracted by the\r\nromanticism of Dupré, but followed such Dutch masters as Paul Potter in\r\nsubordinating the landscape to the cattle. It is for this reason that\r\nTroyon is known to the public as a “cattle-painter” rather than as a\r\nlandscape painter. At the same time, he was a close observer of the\r\neffects of light on fields and meadows, which he rendered with a skill\r\nonly rivalled by the solidity, the suggestion of weight and movement,\r\nthe well-accentuated forms and sinuosities of his cattle. The huge\r\ncanvas _Oxen going to Work_ (No. 889) is an unrivalled achievement of\r\nits kind—a piece of realism that is not without poetry and grandeur.\r\nNext to it in importance ranks the _Return to the Farm_ (No. 890).\r\nAmong the eleven Troyons (Nos. 2906-2916) of the Thomy Thiéry Bequest,\r\nthe _Morning_ (No. 2909) strikes a more cheerful and hopeful note than\r\nis this artist’s wont.\r\n\r\nAnother artist of this group, who devoted himself almost exclusively\r\nto the painting of sheep, is Charles Jacque (1813-1894), from whose\r\nbrush the Louvre owns the _Flock of Sheep in a Landscape_ (No. 430A), a\r\ncharacteristic work of unusually large dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               J. DUPRÉ\r\n\r\nJules Dupré (1811-1889) began, like Troyon, as a china-painter, and,\r\nlike Rousseau, with whom he was for years on terms of intimate\r\nfriendship, benefited by the example of Constable, whose art he had\r\npresumably occasion to study during a visit to England. It was from him\r\nthat he acquired the sense of movement in nature, which is so much more\r\npronounced in his landscapes than in Rousseau’s, whom he exceeded in\r\nbreadth of touch and in power. More particularly in his later manner he\r\nloved to apply his colours in a thick impasto laid on to every part of\r\nthe canvas, including the sky. Only on rare occasions did he adopt the\r\nmore fluid, suave manner shown in _Morning_ (No. 2940) and _Evening_\r\n(No. 2941), the two decorative panels executed for Prince Demidoff, and\r\nacquired by the Louvre in 1880 at the San Donato sale. More typical of\r\nhis virile, forceful style are the twelve signed pictures by Dupré in\r\nthe Thomy Thiéry Bequest (Nos. 2864-2875), especially the fine autumn\r\nlandscape _The Pond_ (No. 2867, Plate L.), the intensely sad, sunless\r\n_Flock in the Landes_ (No. 2871), _The Large Oak_ (No. 2873), and\r\n_The Sunset on a Marsh_ (No. 2874), with the golden glow of the sky\r\nreflected in the water.\r\n\r\nBefore turning to Diaz, who has been aptly called “the most romantic of\r\nthe Romanticists,” we must briefly mention Eugène Isabey (1804-1886),\r\nwho connects the art of the First Empire with Romanticism, and who\r\nknew how to invest his historical paintings with genuinely pictorial\r\ninterest at a time when that class of subject was generally treated\r\nfrom the literary and anecdotal point of view. His exuberant\r\ntemperament led him not infrequently to exaggerated movement. The\r\ntwelve pictures which bear his signature at the Louvre (Nos. 2878-2884,\r\n2953-2956, and 2953A) are illustrative of every phase of his art. As a\r\nlandscape painter he may be considered a forerunner of Rousseau.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 DIAZ\r\n\r\nNarcisse Diaz de la Peña (1809-1876) was born at Bordeaux, the son of\r\npolitical fugitives from Spain, and, like so many artists of this\r\ngroup, started his artistic career as a china-painter. He afterwards\r\ngained considerable success with his romantic figure pictures of\r\nmythological and Oriental subjects, like the _Nymphs in a Wood_ (No.\r\n2854), _Venus and Adonis_ (No. 2858), _Venus disarming Cupid_ (No.\r\n2859), and above all the _Fée aux Perles_ (No. 256). As a landscape\r\npainter he delighted in rendering the sparkle of sunlight penetrating\r\nthrough the dense foliage of forest and brushwood. Diaz must be placed\r\nbetween Isabey and Millet, who followed his example in his early figure\r\npieces; but he was also influenced by Rousseau and by Delacroix. Among\r\nhis eighteen pictures at the Louvre are several landscapes of superb\r\nquality, notably the _Study of a Birch Tree_ (No. 252), _Sous Bois_\r\n(No. 253), and _Dogs in the Forest_ (No. 257A).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                         PLATE L.—JULES DUPRÉ\r\n\r\n                              (1811-1889)\r\n\r\n                          No. 2867.—THE POND\r\n\r\n                               (La Mare)\r\n\r\n  Autumnal landscape with a pond in the middle distance on the left,\r\n  bordered on the right, in the centre of the composition, by a group\r\n  of oak trees.

(0·32 × 0·46.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DAUBIGNY\r\n\r\nOf all the Barbizon painters and their artistic kinship, Charles\r\nFrançois Daubigny (1817-1878) is the one who approached nature with the\r\nmost reverent spirit. He is in a way the least subjective of them all,\r\nbecause his love of nature even in her simplest aspects prevented him\r\nfrom imposing his own personality upon her; and for this very reason he\r\nis more varied in his range of landscape subjects than any of the other\r\nmasters of this important group. The most fugitive effects of light\r\nand atmosphere were seized by him with a masterly sureness which found\r\nexpression in every touch of his summary brush. Every hour of the day,\r\nevery season of the year, every mood of nature appealed to him with\r\nequal intensity, although the choice of his subjects is most frequently\r\ninspired by serene optimism.\r\n\r\nDaubigny belonged to a family of artists. He received his first\r\ninstruction from his father, and afterwards studied under Delaroche.\r\nBefore he began to paint landscapes in the neighbourhood of Paris,\r\nhe gained his livelihood by painting sweet-boxes! He found his best\r\nsubjects on the banks of the Oise, but worked also in other districts\r\nof France, in Italy, and in England. Of his sojourn in England we are\r\nreminded by _The Thames at Erith_ (No. 2821), one of the thirteen\r\nDaubignys bequeathed to the Louvre by Thomy Thiéry, which also include\r\nthe sun-flooded _Weir Gate at Optevoz_ (No. 2818, Plate LI.), _The\r\nPond with Storks_ (No. 2815), _Les Péniches_ (No. 2820), _Morning on\r\nthe River_ (No. 2824), and _The Banks of the Oise_ (No. 2823). _The\r\nVintage in Burgundy_ (No. 184), which was bought by the State at\r\nthe ridiculously low price of £400, is a picture of unusually large\r\ndimensions for an artist who generally needed but a small surface to\r\nexpress his ardent worship of nature. The delicious _Spring_ (No.\r\n185), with its blossoming apple trees and young grass, must be counted\r\namong his finest achievements. It is a picture that fills the heart\r\nof the beholder with the joy and contentment engendered by the blithe\r\natmosphere of a bright spring day in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MILLET\r\n\r\nThe Louvre is fortunate in possessing no fewer than a dozen pictures by\r\nJean François Millet (1814-1875), the great painter of the peasant’s\r\nunceasing struggle with the forces of nature to gain his livelihood\r\nfrom the soil. Millet himself was the son of a peasant, and was kept\r\nbusy with farm work until he had attained the age of twenty, when\r\nhe began to study art at Cherbourg. His studies were repeatedly\r\ninterrupted before he definitely took up art as his profession. Before\r\nhe went to Barbizon, in 1849, to devote himself exclusively to the\r\ngenre in which he was to achieve immortal fame, he gained popular\r\nfavour and admission to the Salon by following the eighteenth-century\r\ntradition of mythological art, and painted a number of nude studies\r\nof nymphs, goddesses, and cupids, not unlike in style to those\r\nof Diaz, but already marked by that firmness of design and by the\r\nmonumental character that are so remarkable in his later work. The\r\nstudy of _Bathing Women_ (No. 642) belongs to that period.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                  PLATE LI.—CHARLES FRANÇOIS DAUBIGNY\r\n\r\n                              (1817-1878)\r\n\r\n                  No. 2818.—THE WEIR GATE AT OPTEVOZ\r\n\r\n                         (La Vanne d’Optevoz)\r\n\r\n  In the limpid clear water of the river, in the foreground, are\r\n  reflected the blue sky and the opposite river bank, which, from a\r\n  grassy slope on the left changes abruptly, near the weir gate, into\r\n  a steep, low, sandstone cliff, on the crest of which some trees and\r\n  bushes are silhouetted against the sky. On the left some ducks are\r\n  swimming on the mirror-like water.\r\n\r\n  Signed on left:—“DAUBIGNY, 1859.”\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on canvas.\r\n\r\n  1 ft. 7¾ in. × 2 ft. 4¾ in. (0·49 × 0·73.)]\r\n\r\nAfter he had settled at Barbizon, Millet, whose peasant origin was\r\nprobably the cause of his intense sympathy with the struggles and\r\nhardships of the field labourers’ fatiguing work, devoted his brush\r\nto creating that profoundly moving record of labour and toil which\r\nconstitutes his claim to be considered one of the world’s great\r\nmasters. He knew how to invest scenes of humble life with truly\r\nmonumental grandeur, and brought out the hopeless monotony and cruel\r\nhardships of the life led by the tillers of the soil with such incisive\r\nstrength, that he was accused of propagandist tendencies. Nothing,\r\nhowever, was further from his aim. He was an artist pure and simple,\r\nwho, in following his own unpopular ideal, preferred to suffer neglect\r\nand extreme poverty to a compromise with the taste of the vulgar.\r\n\r\nThe _Women Gleaning_ (No. 644, Plate LII.) may be considered his\r\nsupreme achievement, and an epitome of his whole art. Millet alone\r\ncould have invested so bald and unpromising a subject with so much epic\r\ngrandeur. There is in the rhythmic repetition of the action of the\r\ntwo women in the centre of the composition a sense of the inevitable\r\nhopeless monotony of labour in the fields, even if the picture is\r\nnot “a plea against the misery of the people.” The same struggle for\r\nexistence and the resulting physical fatigue are admirably expressed\r\nin the statuesquely silhouetted figure of _The Weed-burner_ (No.\r\n2890). _The Woodcutter_ (No. 2895), _The Strawbinders_ (No. 2892), and\r\n_The Winnower_ (No. 2893) all exemplify this phase of Millet’s art.\r\nThe domestic life of the peasantry is treated with equally profound\r\nsympathy in _Maternal Precaution_ (No. 2894), _La Couseuse_ (No. 644A),\r\nand _La Lessiveuse_ (No. 2891). Among his comparatively rare pure\r\nlandscape subjects _The Church of Gréville_ (No. 641), which was found\r\nin an unfinished state in the artist’s studio after his death, takes\r\nvery high rank. It is as remarkable for the simple telling truth with\r\nwhich the normal aspect of the landscape is rendered, as the _Spring_\r\n(No. 643) is for the realisation of a more uncommon effect—a rainbow\r\nand the shrill accent of sunlight in the orchard under the leaden grey\r\nof the departing thunder clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DAUMIER\r\n\r\nWhat Millet did for the life of the country, Honoré Daumier (1808-1879)\r\ndid for the life of the town, of which he was a shrewd and critical\r\nobserver. But his long practice as a caricaturist made him look upon\r\nthe types that engaged his brush with a certain cruel bitterness which\r\nis far removed from Millet’s human sympathy. With a palette restricted\r\nalmost to black and grey, Daumier yet proved himself a great colourist\r\nthrough the infallible accuracy of his tone-values and the suggestion\r\nof rich colour in his almost monochrome schemes. His design is as\r\nmassive and monumental as Millet’s. The touch of the _macabre_, which\r\nis so characteristic of Daumier’s art, is very evident in _The Thieves\r\nand the Donkey_ (No. 2937). The _Portrait of the Painter Théodore\r\nRousseau_ (No. 2938) holds a hint of the caricaturist’s vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                COURBET\r\n\r\nEqually far removed from, and hostile to, Classicism and\r\nRomanticism was Gustave Courbet (1819-1877), who as head and\r\nfounder of the Realistic school exercised a prodigious influence\r\nupon nineteenth-century art. He was essentially a fighting spirit,\r\ndetermined to overcome official hostility to his revolutionary\r\nprinciples. Excluded from public exhibitions, he held a private show\r\nof his own works, and defended his theories by spoken and written\r\narguments. His just claim was that it did not matter _what_ you paint,\r\nbut _how_ you paint what you actually see; and in conformity with\r\nhis loudly proclaimed principles he often chose subjects that were\r\noffensive to the taste of his day. At the same time we can see now that\r\nhe was endowed with a keen instinctive feeling for pictorial fitness,\r\nand that most of his pictures are far from being haphazard snapshots\r\nof actuality. In his student years he had copied many masterpieces by\r\nRembrandt, Velazquez, Hals, and Van Dyck. How much he benefited from\r\nthe example of the old masters is to be judged from his portrait of\r\nhimself, known as _The Man with the Leather-belt_ (No. 147).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                    PLATE LII.—JEAN FRANÇOIS MILLET\r\n\r\n                              (1814-1875)\r\n\r\n                        No. 644.—WOMEN GLEANING\r\n\r\n                            (Les Glaneuses)\r\n\r\n  In a harvest-field three female gleaners, seen in profile to the\r\n  left, are occupied with picking up blades of corn.

(0·82 × 1·12.)]\r\n\r\nBy far his most famous picture is the gigantic _Funeral at Ornans_\r\n(No. 143), which, as a study of the life and types in a small French\r\nprovincial town, has aptly been compared with Flaubert’s great novel\r\n_Madame Bovary_. Each individual head in this vast composition is\r\na marvellous study of facial expression. In his landscapes, again,\r\nhe was by no means photographic, and he never failed to consider\r\nthe decorative effectiveness of his pictures. His influence upon\r\nWhistler’s early work is to be judged from _The Wave_ (No. 147A). If\r\nhis landscapes retain to a certain extent the atmosphere of the studio,\r\nsuch pieces as _La Remise des Chevreuils_ (No. 145A) and _Le Ruisseau\r\ndu Puits noir_ (No. 146A) clearly show that he possessed a sound\r\nunderstanding of the way in which colours react upon, and modify, each\r\nother. Courbet’s revolutionary tendencies made him take part in the\r\npolitical movement of the Commune, and forced him to leave his native\r\ncountry. He died in Switzerland in 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MEISSONIER\r\n\r\nIt was realism of a very different kind that made public opinion place\r\nJean Louis Ernest Meissonier (1815-1891) on a pinnacle, from which he\r\nhas only in recent years been transferred to the more modest position\r\ndue to him, for the exquisite minute care he bestowed upon the working\r\nout of insignificant details. Meissonier was a draughtsman and an\r\nillustrator rather than a painter. As a colourist he does not count.\r\nHe had no appreciation of values, textures, substances, and surfaces.\r\nNothing could be more to the point than Manet’s mordant remark that in\r\nMeissonier’s pictures “everything is of iron except the cuirasses.”\r\nStill, the mind that finds delight in small things will dwell with\r\npleasure upon the microscopic details of his little costume pictures\r\n_The Flute Player_ (No. 2887), _The Poet_ (No. 2889), and several\r\nsimilar “gems” at the Louvre. Strangely enough the _Portrait of Mme.\r\nGerriot_ (No. 2965), which he painted at the age of nineteen, has more\r\nbreadth and real character than any of his later works. The chief task\r\nof Meissonier’s life was the glorification of Napoleon I.’s campaigns.\r\nOf this famous series the Louvre includes no example. On the other\r\nhand, the collection owns three important historical pictures from his\r\nbrush in _Napoleon III. at Solferino_ (No. 2957), which long hung in\r\nthe Luxembourg Gallery, _Napoleon III. surrounded by his Staff_ (No.\r\n2958), and _The Siege of Paris_ (No. 2969), in the painting of which he\r\nhad at least the advantage of personal experience, as he had followed\r\nthe Emperor’s army on the Italian campaign, and was in Paris during the\r\nsiege. Altogether the Louvre owns no fewer than twenty-nine paintings\r\nby Meissonier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RICARD\r\n\r\nIf Meissonier is beginning to find his proper level after having been\r\ngrossly overrated, Louis Gustave Ricard (1824-1873), one of the most\r\nremarkable portrait painters of his century, has only just in recent\r\nyears been rescued from almost complete oblivion. A pupil of L.\r\nCogniet, Ricard spent several years in copying the works and analysing\r\nthe technical methods of the old masters, and in travelling in Italy,\r\nBelgium, Holland, and England. It was not before his return to Paris\r\nin 1850 that he began to exhibit. Ricard was exclusively a portrait\r\npainter. Technically his early studies enabled him to arrive at a\r\nmethod of singular morbidezza and warm luminosity. There is a certain\r\ntruth in a modern critic’s description of Ricard’s pigments as being\r\ncomposed of “crushed jewels, flower juice, and gold and silver powder.”\r\nThe great merit of Ricard’s portraits is, however, his extraordinary\r\ninsight into his sitters’ psychology. To him a portrait meant more than\r\na correct record of the model’s superficial aspect: he endeavoured to\r\npaint the very soul in so far as it can be read from eyes and lips. In\r\nthis respect he is the descendant of Giorgione and the forerunner of\r\nWatts and Carrière. The portraits of _The Painter Heilbuth_ (No. 778A),\r\nof _Mme. de Calonne_ (No. 778E), of _His Own Portrait_ (No. 778), and\r\nthe badly cracked _Portrait of Paul de Musset_ (No. 778B), may be\r\nquoted as admirable instances of his art.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 MANET\r\n\r\nWe must close this necessarily fragmentary survey of French art at the\r\nLouvre with the mention of Edouard Manet (1832-1883), whose _Olympia_\r\n(No. 613A, Plate LIII.) is the first, and so far the only painting of\r\nthe Impressionist school that has gained access to this gallery. It\r\nwas formerly exhibited at the Luxembourg. Hung as it is now in Gallery\r\nVIII. amid the works of David, Gros, Ingres, Delacroix, Delaroche, and\r\nother early nineteenth-century painters, this _Olympia_ fully explains\r\nthe sensation, but certainly not the indignation, caused by its first\r\nappearance at the Salon of 1865. It sings out with such brilliant\r\npurity of colour and is so emphatic in the patterning of its design, so\r\ndaring in the placing side by side of almost unmodulated but infallibly\r\naccurate colour masses, that everything around appears more or less\r\ndingy and artificial. Manet’s _Olympia_ marks the dawn of a new era,\r\nnot because it is based on a revolutionary rejection of tradition, but\r\nbecause it is true to the _spirit_ of the best tradition, which is not\r\ncarried on by literal and mechanical imitation, but by evolution and\r\nadaptation to modern life and thought.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                       PLATE LIII.—ÉDOUARD MANET\r\n\r\n                              (1832-1883)\r\n\r\n                           No. 613A.—OLYMPIA\r\n\r\n  A nude woman, with blue-edged yellow satin slippers on her feet,\r\n  a narrow black riband round her neck, and a gold bracelet on her\r\n  right arm, is reclining on a bed, her right arm resting on the\r\n  cushion.

Its entire\r\nremoval, with the exception of about half a dozen pictures, would not\r\nonly entail no serious loss to the collection, but would be an act of\r\njustice to the reputation of several great artists who are here made\r\nresponsible for pictures upon which they presumably never set eyes.\r\nUnder these circumstances it is quite impossible to illustrate the\r\nprogress of British art by the two-score or so examples in the Long\r\nGallery, part of which is devoted to the English pictures. Of the\r\nleading masters, Hogarth (1697-1764) and Gainsborough (1727-1788) will\r\nbe vainly looked for, since the two _Landscapes_ (Nos. 1811 and 1811B)\r\nattributed to the latter in the La Caze Room are inferior conventional\r\ncompositions in Italian taste, which can no more be connected with the\r\nname of Gainsborough than the wretched _Still Life_ which has lately\r\nbeen added to the Louvre collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CONSTABLE AND HIS IMITATORS\r\n\r\nIn view of the powerful influence exercised by Constable and the\r\nBritish Landscape school in general upon modern French art, it is\r\nsurprising that no attempts should have been made to secure a few\r\nexamples of greater importance and more certain authenticity than the\r\nones now exhibited. Six pictures are catalogued under the name of John\r\nConstable (1776-1837); the only one that can be unreservedly accepted\r\nas the work of his brush is the little view of _Hampstead Heath_ (No.\r\n1809, Plate LIV.), which was presented to the Louvre in 1877 by the\r\npainter’s son, Mr. Lionel Constable. It is a fresh, masterly study for\r\nthe picture in the Sheepshanks collection at the Victoria and Albert\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nThe _Weymouth Bay_ (No. 1808), which realised as much as £2240 at the\r\nMarquis de la Rochebrune’s sale in 1873, has been enthusiastically\r\ncommented upon by Bürger, but cannot pass the ordeal of searching\r\ncriticism. It is incoherent, and in the details of the foreground and\r\nthe painting of the figures and sheep lacks the purposeful sureness of\r\ntouch which is the hall-mark of Constable’s art. _The Cottage_ (No.\r\n1806) has the same provenance. Mr. P. M. Turner, in an article in the\r\n_Burlington Magazine_, suggests that F. W. Watts, a feeble imitator\r\nof Constable, is the real author of this timidly executed painting—an\r\nattribution which is certainly more convincing than the one in the\r\nofficial catalogue. The _Glebe Farm_ (No. 1810) tallies closely, as\r\nregards the superficial aspect, with the picture of the same title at\r\nthe National Gallery, to which it is, however, so inferior as to put\r\nConstable’s authorship out of the question. _The Windmill_ (No. 1810A),\r\na gift of Mr. Sedelmeyer, seems to be a copy of the _Spring_ at the\r\nVictoria and Albert Museum. _The Rainbow_ (No. 1807) may possibly be\r\nby Constable, although its authorship has been questioned by several\r\nreliable authorities.\r\n\r\nJames Webb (1825?-1895), a painter of undeniable talent for imitating\r\nthe manner of artists greater than himself, is beyond much doubt\r\nresponsible both for the _Landscape_ (No. 1820), which is officially\r\ngiven to Richard Wilson (1714-1782), and for the view of the _Pont\r\nNeuf_ (No. 1819), which is still exhibited as an example by the\r\ngreatest English landscape painter J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851).\r\nUnfortunately Turner’s name has to be added to Hogarth’s and\r\nGainsborough’s in the list of eminent British masters who are not\r\nrepresented at the Louvre.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                       PLATE LIV.—JOHN CONSTABLE\r\n\r\n                              (1776-1837)\r\n\r\n                       No. 1809.—HAMPSTEAD HEATH\r\n\r\n                       (Vue de Hampstead Heath)\r\n\r\n  A wide-spreading landscape view, with little incident, from\r\n  Hampstead Heath looking in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\n  Painted in oil on canvas.\r\n\r\n  1 ft. 1¼ in. × 1 ft. 2¼ in.

The two little\r\npictures _François I. and the Duchesse d’Etampes_ (No. 1802) and\r\n_Mazarin and Anne of Austria_ (No. 1803) are conceived quite in the\r\nspirit of the French Romanticists. Bonington’s genius as a colourist\r\nis, however, best displayed in the sparkling and animated _View of\r\nVenice_ (No. 1805). Admirable, too, in their spontaneous freshness are\r\nthe _View of the Gardens at Versailles_ (No. 1804) and the _View of\r\nthe Coast of Normandy_ (No. 1804A). _The Old Governess_ (No. 1805A),\r\none of Bonington’s rare attempts at portraiture, is remarkable for\r\nthe accentuation of the modelling, which somehow suggests the broad\r\ntreatment of the planes adopted by a wood-carver.\r\n\r\nThe picture which is catalogued as _La Halte_ (No. 1814), by George\r\nMorland (1763-1804), is merely a poor copy of that artist’s painting\r\n_The Public-house Door_, engraved by Ward. It was presented to the\r\nLouvre by the proprietors of the magazine _L’Art_.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the great school of British portrait painting, we have\r\nto record at least two or three masterpieces worthy of being included\r\nin a great museum. A picture of unquestioned authenticity and great\r\ncharm is the _Portrait of Master Hare_ (No. 1818B) by Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds (1723-1792), who in this, as in other similar pieces, proved\r\nhimself the painter _par excellence_ of childhood in all its innocence\r\nand ingenuousness, even though this picture is by no means impeccable\r\nas regards draughtsmanship. The _Master Hare_ was bequeathed to the\r\nLouvre by Baron Alphonse de Rothschild in 1905. The badly repainted\r\n_Portrait of a Lady_ (No. 1818A) in a white dress, and with powdered\r\nhair, is certainly not the work of Sir Joshua, under whose name it\r\nfigures in the catalogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RAEBURN\r\n\r\nAmong the recent additions to the Louvre collection is the excellent\r\nlife-size portrait of _Captain Robert Hay of Spot_, by Sir Henry\r\nRaeburn (1756-1823), which still hangs on a screen in Gallery XV. and\r\nhas not yet been provided with a number. It is a full-length portrait\r\nof the sitter, in uniform of scarlet coat, white breeches, black\r\ngaiters, and fur busby, his hand resting upon his gun, standing against\r\na conventional landscape background with a sky of characteristic tawny\r\nhue. The picture was formerly in the collection of Mr. Sanderson, at\r\nthe sale of which, in 1908, it was bought by Messrs. Agnew for 650 gs.\r\nTo Raeburn are also ascribed the extremely puzzling _Portrait of an Old\r\nSailor_ (No. 1817), which, in spite of certain technical affinities\r\nwith the British eighteenth-century school, is so un-English in spirit\r\nthat it would be rash to ascribe it to any master of that school; the\r\nnegligeable _Portrait of Anna Moore, Authoress_ (No. 1817A); also the\r\nutterly commonplace and wretchedly drawn _Mrs. Maconochie and Child_\r\n(No. 1817B), which was bought in 1904, together with the equally\r\nquestionable _Portrait of a Lady and a Young Boy_ (No. 1812B), by\r\nHoppner, for £4000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE\r\n\r\nThe strangely exaggerated estimation in which Sir Thomas Lawrence\r\n(1769-1830) is held by French connoisseurs, is to a certain extent\r\nto be accounted for by the superb quality of the picture by which he\r\nis best known in France: the portrait group of _J. J. Angerstein and\r\nhis Wife_ (No. 1813A) at the Louvre, which was acquired in 1896 for\r\n£3000. This fine group displays all his bravura and pleasing freshness\r\nand brightness of colour, without any of the vulgar tricks and\r\nshallow mannerisms of his later years. Next to it should be mentioned\r\nthe charming half-length life-size _Portrait of Mary Palmer_ (No.\r\n1813C), in a yellow dress, seated in a garden. The completely wrecked\r\n_Portrait of Lord Whitworth, English Ambassador to France in 1802_ (No.\r\n1813), and the _Portrait of a Man_ (No. 1813D), are of no artistic\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nNeither is it necessary to dwell upon the mediocre _Brother and\r\nSister_ (No. 1801), by Sir William Beechey (1753-1839); the _Portrait\r\nof Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Princess of Wales_ (No.\r\n1818), by Allan Ramsay (1713-1784); and the _Portrait of Lamartine,\r\nFrench Poet and Politician_ (No. 1816A), by Henry Wyndham Phillips\r\n(1820-1868). _The Woman in White_ (No. 1816) is at least a sound piece\r\nof craftsmanship, even if the attribution to John Opie (1761-1807),\r\n“the Cornish Wonder,” is subject to doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        OTHER PORTRAIT PAINTERS\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the portrait group (No. 1812B), a picture in\r\ndeplorable condition, to which the name of John Hoppner (1758?-1810)\r\nhas been attached without sufficient reason. No less doubtful is the\r\nauthenticity of the _Portrait of the Countess of Oxford_ (No. 1812A), a\r\nmeretricious picture which serves to show the mannerisms and striving\r\nafter prettiness of Lawrence’s rival, rather than the more estimable\r\nqualities by which his better achievements are distinguished.\r\n\r\nGeorge Romney (1734-1802), on the other hand, is seen in his\r\nmost serious mood in the _Portrait of Sir John Stanley_ (No.\r\n1818C)— a thoroughly honest “likeness,” well drawn, and painted\r\nstraight-forwardly, without tricky accents and mechanical recipes. On a\r\nscreen in Gallery XV. has been temporarily placed a recently acquired\r\n_Portrait of the Artist_, by Romney. He is seated, palette in hand, in\r\na landscape background. The features are well modelled, and the light\r\nand shade managed with considerable skill.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough the most remarkable English picture at the Louvre\r\nis by a little known painter, who is not represented in any of the\r\nleading British galleries. Charles Howard Hodges (1764-1837), who was\r\nborn in London, but went at the age of twenty-four to Holland, where\r\nhe spent the rest of his life, was really a mezzotint engraver, in\r\nwhich craft he had been trained by John Raphael Smith. He produced many\r\nplates after pictures by the Dutch masters, and also painted a few\r\nportraits, among them the masterly _Portrait of a Woman_ (No. 1812),\r\nat the Louvre. At a time which was too much given to conventionality\r\nand to the desire to please by concessions to a popular craving for\r\nprettiness, this picture strikes a note of almost brutal realism. It\r\nis painted with surprising vigour and with an appreciation of correct\r\ntone-values, in a low key, which heralds the art of the Glasgow school\r\nin the later decades of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nWith _The Bathing Woman_ (No. 1810B), by William Etty (1787-1849), and\r\n_The Watering Place_ (No. 1815), by William Mulready (1786-1863), we\r\nreach the full decadence of the British school in early Victorian days\r\nbefore the great revival initiated by the pre-Raphaelites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEXES\r\n\r\n\r\n                          I.
