  "content": "THE FORMER PHILIPPINES THRU FOREIGN EYES\r\n\r\nEdited by Austin Craig\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\nAmong the many wrongs done the Filipinos by Spaniards, to be charged\r\nagainst their undeniably large debt to Spain, one of the greatest,\r\nif not the most frequently mentioned, was taking from them their\r\ngood name.\r\n\r\nSpanish writers have never been noted for modesty or historical\r\naccuracy. Back in 1589 the printer of the English translation of Padre\r\nJuan Gonzalez de Mendoza's \"History of the Great and Mighty Kingdom of\r\nChina\" felt it necessary to prefix this warning: * * * the Spaniards\r\n(following their ambitious affections) do usually in all their writings\r\nextoll their own actions, even to the setting forth of many untruthes\r\nand incredible things, as in their descriptions of the conquistes of\r\nthe east and west Indies, etc., doth more at large appeare.\r\n\r\nOf early Spanish historians Doctor Antonio de Morga seems the single\r\nexception, and perhaps even some of his credit comes by contrast,\r\nbut in later years the rule apparently has proved invariable. As\r\nthe conditions in the successive periods of Spanish influence were\r\nrecognized to be indicative of little progress, if not actually\r\nretrogressive, the practice grew up of correspondingly lowering the\r\ncurrent estimates of the capacity of the Filipinos of the conquest, so\r\nthat always an apparent advance appeared. This in the closing period,\r\nin order to fabricate a sufficient showing for over three centuries\r\nof pretended progress, led to the practical denial of human attributes\r\nto the Filipinos found here by Legaspi.\r\n\r\nAgainst this denial to his countrymen of virtues as well as\r\nrights, Doctor Rizal opposed two briefs whose English titles\r\nare \"The Philippines A Century Hence\" and \"The Indolence of the\r\nFilipino.\" Almost every page therein shows the influence of the young\r\nstudent's early reading of the hereinafter-printed studies by the\r\nGerman scientist Jagor, friend and counsellor in his maturer years,\r\nand the liberal Spaniard Comyn. Even his acquaintance with Morga,\r\nwhich eventually led to Rizal's republication of the 1609 history\r\nlong lost to Spaniards, probably was owing to Jagor, although the\r\nlife-long resolution for that action can be traced to hearing of Sir\r\nJohn Bowring's visit to his uncle's home and the proposed Hakluyt\r\nSociety English translation then mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe present value and interest of these now rare books has suggested\r\ntheir republication, to make available to Filipino students a course\r\nof study which their national hero found profitable as well as to\r\ncorrect the myriad misconceptions of things Philippine in the minds\r\nof those who have taken the accepted Spanish accounts as gospel truths.\r\n\r\nDr. L. V. Schweibs, of Berlin, made the hundreds of corrections,\r\nmany reversing the meanings of former readings, which almost\r\njustify calling the revised Jagor translation a new one. Numerous\r\nhitherto-untranslated passages likewise appear. There have been\r\nleft out the illustrations, from crude drawings obsolete since\r\nphotographic pictures have familiarized the scenes and objects,\r\nand also the consequently superfluous references to these. No other\r\nomission has been allowed, for if one author leaned far to one side in\r\ncertain debatable questions the other has been equally partisan for the\r\nopposite side, except a cerement on religion in general and discussion\r\nof the world-wide social evil were eliminated as having no particular\r\nPhilippine bearing to excuse their appearance in a popular work.\r\n\r\nThe early American quotations of course are for comparison with the\r\nnumerous American comments of today, and the two magazine extracts\r\ngive English accounts a century apart. Virchow's matured views have\r\nbeen substituted for the pioneer opinions he furnished Professor Jagor\r\nthirty years earlier, and if Rizal's patron in the scientific world\r\nfails at times in his facts his method for research is a safe guide.\r\n\r\nFinally, three points should constantly be borne in mind: (1) allowance\r\nmust be made for the lessening Spanish influence, surely more foreign\r\nto this seafaring people than the present modified Anglo-Saxon\r\neducation, and so more artificial, i.e., less assimilable, as well\r\nas for the removal of the unfavorable environment, before attempting\r\nto from an opinion of the present-day Filipino from his prototype\r\npictured in those pages; (2) foreign observers are apt to emphasize\r\nwhat is strange to them in describing other lands than their own and to\r\nleave unnoted points of resemblance which may be much more numerous;\r\n(3) Rizal's judgment that his countrymen were more like backward\r\nEuropeans than Orientals was based on scientific studies of Europe's\r\nrural districts and Philippine provincial conditions as well as of\r\noriental country life, so that it is entitled to more weight than\r\nthe commoner opinion to the contrary which though more popular has\r\nbeen less carefully formed.\r\n\r\nUniversity of the Philippines,\r\n\r\nManila, March 11th, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\nJagor's Travels in the Philippines 1\r\n\r\n(The out-of-print 1875 English translation corrected from the original\r\nGerman text)\r\n\r\nState of the Philippines in 1810.

Some time ago, however, while the new year was being\r\ncelebrated in Madrid, it was only New Year's eve at Manila.\r\n\r\n[Magellan's mistake in reckoning.] As Magellan, who discovered the\r\nPhilippines in his memorable first circumnavigation of the globe,\r\nwas following the sun in its apparent daily path around the world,\r\nevery successive degree he compassed on his eastern course added\r\nfour minutes to the length of his day; and, when he reached the\r\nPhilippines, the difference amounted to sixteen hours. This, however,\r\napparently escaped his notice, for Elcano, the captain of the only\r\nremaining vessel, was quite unaware, on his return to the longitude\r\nof his departure, why according to his ship's log-book, he was a day\r\nbehind the time of the port which he had reached again by continuously\r\nsailing westward. [2] [3]\r\n\r\n[Change to the Asian day.] The error remained also unheeded in the\r\nPhilippines. It was still, over there the last day of the old year,\r\nwhile the rest of the world was commencing the new one; and this state\r\nof things continued till the close of 1844, when it was resolved,\r\nwith the approval of the archbishop, to pass over New Year's eve for\r\nonce altogether. [4] Since that time the Philippines are considered\r\nto lie no longer in the distant west, but in the far east, and are\r\nabout eight hours in advance of their mother country. The proper field\r\nfor their commerce, however, is what is to Europeans the far west;\r\nthey were colonized thence, and for centuries, till 1811, they had\r\nalmost no other communication with Europe but the indirect one by\r\nthe annual voyage of the galleon between Manila and Acapulco. Now,\r\nhowever, when the eastern shores of the Pacific are at last beginning\r\nto teem with life, and, with unexampled speed, are pressing forward to\r\ngrasp their stupendous future, the Philippines will no longer be able\r\nto remain in their past seclusion. No tropical Asiatic colony is so\r\nfavorably situated for communication with the west coast of America,\r\nand it is only in a few matters that the Dutch Indies can compete with\r\nthem for the favors of the Australian market. But, [Future in American\r\nand Australian trade.] on the other hand, they will have to abandon\r\ntheir traffic with China, whose principal emporium Manila originally\r\nwas, as well as that with those westward-looking countries of Asia,\r\nEurope's far east, which lie nearest to the Atlantic ports.  [5] [6]\r\n\r\n[Commercially in the New World.] When the circumstances mentioned\r\ncome to be realized, the Philippines, or, at any rate, the principal\r\nmarket for their commerce, will finally fall within the limits of\r\nthe western hemisphere, to which indeed they were relegated by the\r\nillustrious Spanish geographers at Badajoz.\r\n\r\n[The Pope's world-partitive.] The Bull issued by Alexander VI, [7]\r\non May 4, 1493, which divided the earth into two hemispheres, decreed\r\nthat all heathen lands discovered in the eastern half should belong\r\nto the Portuguese; in the western half to the Spaniards. According to\r\nthis arrangement, the latter could only claim the Philippines under\r\nthe pretext that they were situated in the western hemisphere. The\r\ndemarcation line was to run from the north to the south, a hundred\r\nleagues to the south-west of all the so-called Azores and Cape\r\nde Verde Islands. In accordance with the treaty of Tordesillas,\r\nnegotiated between Spain and Portugal on June 7, 1494, and approved\r\nby Julius II, in 1506, this line was drawn three hundred and seventy\r\nleagues west of the Cape de Verde Islands.\r\n\r\n[Faulty Spanish and Portuguese geography.] At that time Spanish and\r\nPortuguese geographers reckoned seventeen and one-half leagues to a\r\ndegree on the equator. In the latitude of the Cape de Verde Islands,\r\nthree hundred and seventy leagues made 21° 55'. If to this we add\r\nthe longitudinal difference between the westernmost point of the\r\ngroup and Cadiz, a difference of 18° 48', we get 40° 43' west, and\r\n139° 17' east from Cadiz (in round numbers 47° west and 133° east),\r\nas the limits of the Spanish hemisphere. At that time, however,\r\nthe existing means for such calculations were entirely insufficient.\r\n\r\n[Extravagant Spanish claims thru ignorance.] The latitude was measured\r\nwith imperfect astrolabes, or wooden quadrants, and calculated from\r\nvery deficient tables; the variation of the compass, moreover, was\r\nalmost unknown, as well as the use of the log. [8] Both method and\r\ninstruments were wanting for useful longitudinal calculations. It was\r\nunder these circumstances that the Spaniards attempted, at Badajoz,\r\nto prove to the protesting Portuguese that the eastern boundary line\r\nintersected the mouths of the Ganges, and proceeded to lay claim to\r\nthe possession of the Spice Islands.\r\n\r\n[Spain's error in calculation.] The eastern boundary should, in\r\nreality, have been drawn 46 1/2° further to the east, that is to\r\nsay, as much further as it is from Berlin to the coast of Labrador,\r\nor to the lesser Altai; for, in the latitude of Calcutta 46 1/2°\r\nare equivalent to two thousand five hundred and seventy-five nautical\r\nmiles. Albo's log-book gives the difference in longitude between the\r\nmost eastern islands of the Archipelago and Cape Fermoso (Magellan's\r\nStraits), as 106° 30', while in reality it amounts to 159° 85'.\r\n\r\n[Moluccan rights sold to Portugal.] The disputes between the Spaniards\r\nand the Portuguese, occasioned by the uncertainty of the eastern\r\nboundary--Portugal had already founded a settlement in the Spice\r\nIslands--were set at rest by an agreement made in 1529, in which\r\nCharles V. abandoned his pretended rights to the Moluccas in favor\r\nof Portugal, for the sum of 350,000 ducats. The Philippines, at that\r\ntime, were of no value.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n[Foreign mail facilities.] The distance from Manila to Hongkong is\r\nsix hundred fifty nautical miles, and the course is almost exactly\r\nsouth-east. The mail steamer running between the two ports makes the\r\ntrip in from three to four days. This allows of a fortnightly postal\r\ncommunication between the colony and the rest of the world. [9]\r\n\r\n[Slight share in world commerce.] This small steamer is the only thing\r\nto remind an observer at Hongkong, a port thronged with the ships of\r\nall nations, that an island so specially favored in conditions and\r\nfertility lies in such close proximity.\r\n\r\n[Little commerce with Spain.] Although the Philippines belong to Spain,\r\nthere is but little commerce between the two countries. Once the\r\ntie which bound them was so close that Manila was wont to celebrate\r\nthe arrival of the Spanish mail with Te Deums and bell-ringing, in\r\nhonor of the successful achievement of so stupendous a journey. Until\r\nPortugal fell to Spain, the road round Africa to the Philippines was\r\nnot open to Spanish vessels. The condition of the overland route\r\nis sufficiently shown by the fact that two Augustinian monks who,\r\nin 1603, were entrusted with an important message for the king,\r\nand who chose the direct line through Goa, Turkey, and Italy, needed\r\nthree years for reaching Madrid. [10]\r\n\r\n[Former Spanish ships mainly carried foreign goods.] The trade by\r\nSpanish ships, which the merchants were compelled to patronize in\r\norder to avoid paying an additional customs tax, in spite of the\r\nprotective duties for Spanish products, was almost exclusively\r\nin foreign goods to the colony and returning the products of the\r\nlatter for foreign ports. The traffic with Spain was limited to the\r\nconveyance of officials, priests, and their usual necessaries, such as\r\nprovisions, wine and other liquors; and, except a few French novels,\r\nsome atrociously dull books, histories of saints, and similar works.\r\n\r\n[Manila's fine bay.] The Bay of Manila is large enough to contain the\r\nunited fleets of Europe; it has the reputation of being one of the\r\nfinest in the world. The aspect of the coast, however, to a stranger\r\narriving, as did the author, at the close of the dry season, falls\r\nshort of the lively descriptions of some travellers. The circular bay,\r\none hundred twenty nautical miles in circumference, the waters of\r\nwhich wash the shores of five different provinces, is fringed in the\r\nneighborhood of Manila by a level coast, behind which rises an equally\r\nflat table land. The scanty vegetation in the foreground, consisting\r\nchiefly of bamboos and areca palms, was dried up by the sun; while in\r\nthe far distance the dull uniformity of the landscape was broken by\r\nthe blue hills of San Mateo. In the rainy season the numerous unwalled\r\ncanals overflow their banks and form a series of connected lakes,\r\nwhich soon, however, change into luxuriant and verdant rice-fields.\r\n\r\n[City's appearance mediaeval European.] Manila is situated on both\r\nsides of the river Pasig. The town itself, surrounded with walls and\r\nramparts, with its low tiled roofs and a few towers, had, in 1859,\r\nthe appearance of some ancient European fortress. Four years later\r\nthe greater part of it was destroyed by an earthquake.\r\n\r\n[The 1863 earthquake.] On June 3, 1863, at thirty-one minutes past\r\nseven in the evening, after a day of tremendous heat while all Manila\r\nwas busy in its preparations for the festival of Corpus Christi,\r\nthe ground suddenly rocked to and fro with great violence. The\r\nfirmest buildings reeled visibly, walls crumbled, and beams snapped\r\nin two. The dreadful shock lasted half a minute; but this little\r\ninterval was enough to change the whole town into a mass of ruins,\r\nand to bury alive hundreds of its inhabitants. [11] A letter of\r\nthe governor-general, which I have seen, states that the cathedral,\r\nthe goverment-house, the barracks, and all the public buildings of\r\nManila were entirely destroyed, and that the few private houses which\r\nremained standing threatened to fall in. Later accounts speak of\r\nfour hundred killed and two thousand injured, and estimate the loss\r\nat eight millions of dollars. Forty-six public and five hundred and\r\nseventy private buildings were thrown down; twenty-eight public and\r\nfive hundred twenty-eight private buildings were nearly destroyed,\r\nand all the houses left standing were more or less injured.\r\n\r\n[Damage in Cavite.] At the same time, an earthquake of forty seconds'\r\nduration occurred at Cavite, the naval port of the Philippines,\r\nand destroyed many buildings.\r\n\r\n[Destruction in walled city.] Three years afterwards, the Duc\r\nd'Alencon (Lucon et Mindanao; Paris, 1870, S. 38) found the traces\r\nof the catastrophe everywhere. Three sides of the principal square\r\nof the city, in which formerly stood the government, or governor's,\r\npalace, the cathedral, and the townhouse, were lying like dust heaps\r\novergrown with weeds. All the large public edifices were \"temporarily\"\r\nconstructed of wood; but nobody then seemed to plan anything permanent.\r\n\r\n[Former heavy shocks.] Manila is very often subject to earthquakes;\r\nthe most fatal occurred in 1601; in 1610 (Nov. 30); in 1645 (Nov. 30);\r\nin 1658 (Aug. 20); in 1675; in 1699; in 1796; in 1824; in 1852; and\r\nin 1863. In 1645, six hundred [12], or, according to some accounts,\r\nthree thousand [13] persons perished, buried under the ruins of their\r\nhouses. Their monastery, the church of the Augustinians, and that of\r\nthe Jesuits, were the only public buildings which remained standing.\r\n\r\n[Frequent minor disturbances.] Smaller shocks, which suddenly set\r\nthe hanging lamps swinging, occur very often and generally remain\r\nunnoticed. The houses are on this account generally of but one story,\r\nand the loose volcanic soil on which they are built may lessen the\r\nviolence of the shock. Their heavy tiled roofs, however, appear\r\nvery inappropriate under such circumstances. Earthquakes are also\r\nof frequent occurrence in the provinces, but they, as a rule, cause\r\nso little damage, owing to the houses being constructed of timber or\r\nbamboo, that they are never mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Scanty data available.] M. Alexis Perrey (Mém. de l'Académie de\r\nDijon, 1860) has published a list, collected with much diligence from\r\nevery accessible source, of the earthquakes which have visited the\r\nPhilippines, and particularly Manila. But the accounts, even of the\r\nmost important, are very scanty, and the dates of their occurrence very\r\nunreliable. Of the minor shocks, only a few are mentioned, those which\r\nwere noticed by scientific observers accidentally present at the time.\r\n\r\n[The 1610 catastrophe.] Aduarte (I. 141) mentions a tremendous\r\nearthquake which occurred in 1610. I briefly quote his version of\r\nthe details of the catastrophe, as I find them mentioned nowhere else.\r\n\r\n\"Towards the close of November, 1610, on St. Andrew's Day, a more\r\nviolent earthquake than had ever before been witnessed, visited\r\nthese Islands; its effects extended from Manila to the extreme end\r\nof the province of Nueva Segovia (the whole northern part of Luzon),\r\na distance of 200 leagues. It caused great destruction over the entire\r\narea; in the province of Ilocos it buried palm trees, so that only the\r\ntops of their branches were left above the earth's surface; through\r\nthe power of the earthquake mountains were pushed against each other;\r\nit threw down many buildings, and killed a great number of people. Its\r\nfury was greatest in Nueva Segovia, where it opened the mountains, and\r\ncreated new lake basins. The earth threw up immense fountains of sand,\r\nand vibrated so terribly that the people, unable to stand upon it,\r\nlaid down and fastened themselves to the ground, as if they had been\r\non a ship in a stormy sea. In the range inhabited by the Mendayas a\r\nmountain fell in, crushing a village and killing its inhabitants. An\r\nimmense portion of the cliff sank into the river; and now, where the\r\nstream was formerly bordered by a range of hills of considerable\r\naltitude, its banks are nearly level with the watercourse. The\r\ncommotion was so great in the bed of the river that waves arose like\r\nthose of the ocean, or as if the water had been lashed by a furious\r\nwind. Those edifices which were of stone suffered the most damage,\r\nour church and the convent fell in, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n[Customhouse red tape.] The customs inspection, and the many\r\nformalities which the native minor officials exercised without any\r\nconsideration appear all the more wearisome to the new arrival when\r\ncontrasted with the easy routine of the English free ports of the\r\neast he has just quitted. The guarantee of a respectable merchant\r\nobtained for me, as a particular favor, permission to disembark after\r\na detention of sixteen hours; but even then I was not allowed to take\r\nthe smallest article of luggage on shore with me.\r\n\r\n[Shelter for shipping.] During the south-west monsoon and the stormy\r\nseason that accompanies the change of monsoons, the roadstead is\r\nunsafe. Larger vessels are then obliged to seek protection in the\r\nport of Cavite, seven miles further down the coast; but during the\r\nnorth-east monsoons they can safely anchor half a league from the\r\ncoast. All ships under three hundred tons burden pass the breakwater\r\nand enter the Pasig, where, as far as the bridge, they lie in serried\r\nrows, extending from the shore to the middle of the stream, and bear\r\nwitness by their numbers, as well as by the bustle and stir going on\r\namongst them, to the activity of the home trade.\r\n\r\n[Silting up of river mouth.] In every rain-monsoon, the Pasig river\r\nsweeps such a quantity of sediment against the breakwater that just\r\nits removal keeps, as it seems, the dredging machine stationed there\r\nentirely occupied.\r\n\r\n[Few foreign vessels.] The small number of the vessels in the\r\nroadstead, particularly of those of foreign countries, was the more\r\nremarkable as Manila was the only port in the Archipelago that had any\r\ncommerce with foreign countries. It is true that since 1855 three other\r\nports, to which a fourth may now be added, had gotten this privilege;\r\nbut at the time of my arrival, in March, 1859, not one of them had\r\never been entered by a foreign vessel, and it was a few weeks after\r\nmy visit that the first English ship sailed into Iloilo to take in\r\na cargo of sugar for Australia. [14]\r\n\r\n[Antiquated restrictions on trade.] The reason of this peculiarity\r\nlaid partly in the feeble development of agriculture, in spite of the\r\nunexampled fertility of the soil, but chiefly in the antiquated and\r\nartificially limited conditions of trade. The customs duties were\r\nin themselves not very high. They were generally about seven per\r\ncent. upon merchandise conveyed under the Spanish flag, and about\r\ntwice as much for that carried in foreign bottoms. When the cargo\r\nwas of Spanish production, the duty was three per cent. if carried\r\nin national vessels, eight per cent. if in foreign ships. The latter\r\nwere only allowed, as a rule, to enter the port in ballast. [15]\r\n\r\n[Discouragements for foreign ships.] As, however, the principal wants\r\nof the colony were imported from England and abroad, these were either\r\nkept back till an opportunity occurred of sending them in Spanish\r\nvessels, which charged nearly a treble freight (from £4 to £5 instead\r\nof from £1 1/2, to £2 per ton), and which only made their appearance\r\nin British ports at rare intervals, or they were sent to Singapore and\r\nHongkong, where they were transferred to Spanish ships. Tonnage dues\r\nwere levied, moreover, upon ships in ballast, and upon others which\r\nmerely touched at Manila without unloading or taking in fresh cargo;\r\nand, if a vessel under such circumstances landed even the smallest\r\nparcel, it was no longer rated as a ship in ballast, but charged on the\r\nhigher scale. Vessels were therefore forced to enter the port entirely\r\ndevoid of cargo, or carrying sufficient to cover the expense of the\r\nincreased harbor dues; almost an impossibility for foreign ships,\r\non account of the differential customs rates, which acted almost as a\r\ncomplete prohibition. The result was that foreign vessels came there\r\nonly in ballast, or when summoned for some particular object.\r\n\r\n[Export taxes.] The exports of the colony were almost entirely\r\nlimited to its raw produce, which was burdened with an export duty\r\nof three per cent. Exports leaving under the Spanish flag were only\r\ntaxed to the amount of one per cent.; but, as scarcely any export\r\ntrade existed with Spain, and as Spanish vessels, from their high\r\nrates of freight, were excluded from the carrying trade of the world,\r\nthe boon to commerce was a delusive one.  [16]\r\n\r\n[Laws drove away trade.] These inept excise laws, hampered with a\r\nhundred suspicious forms, frightened away the whole carrying trade\r\nfrom the port; and its commission merchants were frequently unable\r\nto dispose of the local produce. So trifling was the carrying trade\r\nthat the total yearly average of the harbor dues, calculated from\r\nthe returns of ten years, barely reached $10,000.\r\n\r\n[Manila's favorable location.] The position of Manila, a central\r\npoint betwixt Japan, China, Annam, the English and Dutch ports of\r\nthe Archipelago and Australia, is in itself extremely favorable\r\nto the development of a world-wide trade. [17] At the time of the\r\nnorth-eastern monsoons, during our winter, when vessels for the sake of\r\nshelter pass through the Straits of Gilolo on their way from the Indian\r\nArchipelago to China, they are obliged to pass close to Manila. They\r\nwould find it a most convenient station, for the Philippines, as we\r\nhave already mentioned, are particularly favorably placed for the\r\nwest coast of America.\r\n\r\n[The 1869 reform.] A proof that the Spanish Ultramar minister fully\r\nrecognizes and appreciates these circumstances appears in his decree,\r\nof April 5, 1869, which is of the highest importance for the future\r\nof the colony. It probably would have been issued earlier had not the\r\nSpanish and colonial shipowners, pampered by the protective system,\r\nobstinately struggled against an innovation which impaired their\r\nformer privileges and forced them to greater activity.\r\n\r\n[Bettered conditions.] The most noteworthy points of the decree are\r\nthe moderation of the differential duties, and their entire extinction\r\nat the expiration of two years; the abrogation of all export duties;\r\nand the consolidation of the more annoying port dues into one single\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n[Pre-Spanish foreign commerce.] When the Spaniards landed in the\r\nPhilippines they found the inhabitants clad in silks and cotton stuffs,\r\nwhich were imported by Chinese ships to exchange for gold-dust,\r\nsapan wood, [18] holothurian, edible birds' nests, and skins. The\r\nIslands were also in communication with Japan, Cambodia, Siam, [19]\r\nthe Moluccas, and the Malay Archipelago. De Barros mentions that\r\nvessels from Luzon visited Malacca in 1511. [20]\r\n\r\n[Early extension under Spain.] The greater order which reigned in\r\nthe Philippines after the advent of the Spaniards, and still more the\r\ncommerce they opened with America and indirectly with Europe, had the\r\neffect of greatly increasing the Island trade, and of extending it\r\nbeyond the Indies to the Persian Gulf. Manila was the great mart for\r\nthe products of Eastern Asia, with which it loaded the galleons that,\r\nas early as 1565, sailed to and from New Spain (at first to Navidad,\r\nafter 1602 to Acapulco), and brought back silver as their principal\r\nreturn freight. [21]\r\n\r\n[Jealousy of Seville monopolists.] The merchants in New Spain and Peru\r\nfound this commerce so advantageous, that the result was very damaging\r\nto the exports from the mother country, whose manufactured goods were\r\nunable to compete with the Indian cottons and the Chinese silks. The\r\nspoilt monopolists of Seville demanded therefore the abandonment of a\r\ncolony which required considerable yearly contributions from the home\r\nexchequer, which stood in the way of the mother country's exploiting\r\nher American colonies, and which let the silver of His Majesty's\r\ndominions pass into the hands of the heathen. Since the foundation of\r\nthe colony they had continually thrown impediments in its path. [22]\r\nTheir demands, however, were vain in face of the ambition of the\r\nthrone and the influence of the clergy; rather, responding to the\r\nviews of that time the merchants of Peru and New Spain were forced,\r\nin the interests of the mother country, to obtain merchandise from\r\nChina, either directly, or through Manila. The inhabitants of the\r\nPhilippines were alone permitted to send Chinese goods to America,\r\nbut only to the yearly value of $250,000. The return trade was limited\r\nto $500,000. [23]\r\n\r\n[Prohibition of China trading.] The first amount was afterwards\r\nincreased to $300,000, with a proportionate augmentation of the\r\nreturn freight; but the Spanish were forbidden to visit China, so\r\nthat they were obliged to await the arrival of the junks. Finally,\r\nin 1720, Chinese goods were strictly prohibited throughout the\r\nwhole of the Spanish possessions in both hemispheres. A decree of\r\n1734 (amplified in 1769) once more permitted trade with China, and\r\nincreased the maximum value of the annual freightage to Acapulco to\r\n$500,000 (silver) and that of the return trade to twice the amount.\r\n\r\n[Higher limit on suspension of galleon voyages.] After the galleons to\r\nAcapulco, which had been maintained at the expense of the government\r\ntreasury, had stopped their voyages, commerce with America was\r\nhandled by merchants who were permitted in 1820, to export goods\r\nup to $750,000 annually from the Philippines and to visit San Blas,\r\nGuayaquil and Callao, besides Acapulco.\r\n\r\n[ British occupation inspired new wants.] This concession, however,\r\nwas not sufficient to compensate Philippine commerce for the injuries\r\nit suffered through the separation of Mexico from Spain. The possession\r\nof Manila by the English, in 1762, made its inhabitants acquainted with\r\nmany industrial products which the imports from China and India were\r\nunable to offer them. To satisfy these new cravings Spanish men-of-war\r\nwere sent, towards the close of 1764, to the colony with products of\r\nSpanish industries, such as wine, provisions, hats, cloth, hardware,\r\nand fancy articles.\r\n\r\n[Manila oppositions to trade innovations.] The Manila merchants,\r\naccustomed to a lucrative trade with Acapulco, strenuously resisted\r\nthis innovation, although it was a considerable source of profit to\r\nthem, for the Crown purchased the Indian and Chinese merchandise for\r\nits return freights from Manila at double their original value. In\r\n1784, however, the last of these ships arrived.\r\n\r\n[Subterfuges of European traders.] After the English invasion,\r\nEuropean vessels were strictly forbidden to visit Manila; but as\r\nthat city did not want to do without Indian merchandise, and could\r\nnot import it in its own ships, it was brought there in English and\r\nFrench bottoms, which assumed a Turkish name, and were provided with\r\nan Indian sham-captain.\r\n\r\n[The \"Philippine Company\" monopoly.] In 1785, the Compañía de Filipinas\r\nobtained a monopoly of the trade between Spain and the colony, but it\r\nwas not allowed to interfere with the direct traffic between Acapulco\r\nand Manila. The desire was to acquire large quantities of colonial\r\nproduce, silk, indigo, cinnamon, cotton, pepper, etc., in order to\r\nexport it somewhat as was done later on by the system of culture in\r\nJava; but as it was unable to obtain compulsory labor, it entirely\r\nfailed in its attempted artificial development of agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Losses by bad management.] The Compañía suffered great losses through\r\nits erroneous system of operation, and the incapacity of its officials\r\n(it paid, for example, $13.50 for a picul of pepper which cost from\r\nthree to four dollars in Sumatra).\r\n\r\n[Entrance of foriegn ships and firms.] In 1789 foreign ships were\r\nallowed to import Chinese and Indian produce, but none from Europe. In\r\n1809 an English commercial house obtained permission to establish\r\nitself in Manila. [24] In 1814, after the conclusion of the peace\r\nwith France, the same permission, with greater or less restrictions,\r\nwas granted to all foreigners.\r\n\r\n[Trade free but port charges discriminating.]  In 1820 the direct\r\ntrade between the Philippines and Spain was thrown open without any\r\nlimitations to the exports of colonial produce, on the condition\r\nthat the value of the Indian and Chinese goods in each expedition\r\nshould not exceed $50,000. Ever since 1834, when the privileges\r\nof the Compañía expired, free trade has been permitted in Manila;\r\nforeign ships, however, being charged double dues. Four new ports\r\nhave been thrown open to general trade since 1855; and in 1869 the\r\nliberal tariff previously alluded to was issued.\r\n\r\n[Port's importance lessened under Spain.]  Today, after three centuries\r\nof almost undisturbed Spanish rule, Manila has by no means added to the\r\nimportance it possessed shortly after the advent of the Spaniards. The\r\nisolation of Japan and the Indo-Chinese empires, a direct consequence\r\nof the importunities and pretensions of the Catholic missionaries, [25]\r\nthe secession of the colonies on the west coast of America, above all\r\nthe long continuance of a distrustful commercial and colonial policy--a\r\npolicy which exists even at the present day--while important markets,\r\nbased on large capital and liberal principles, were being established\r\nin the most favored spots of the British and Dutch Indies; all these\r\ncircumstances have contributed to this result and thrown the Chinese\r\ntrade into other channels. The cause is as clear as the effect,\r\nyet it might be erroneous to ascribe the policy so long pursued to\r\nshort-sightedness. The Spaniards, in their schemes of colonisation,\r\nhad partly a religious purpose in view, but the government discovered\r\na great source of influence in the disposal of the extremely lucrative\r\ncolonial appointments. The crown itself, as well as its favorites,\r\nthought of nothing but extracting the most it could from the colony,\r\nand had neither the intention or the power to develop the natural\r\nwealth of the country by agriculture and commerce. Inseparable from\r\nthis policy, was the persistent exclusion of foreigners. [26] It seemed\r\neven more necessary in the isolated Philippines than in America to cut\r\noff the natives from all contact with foreigners, if the Spaniards had\r\nany desire to remain in undisturbed possession of the colony. In face,\r\nhowever, of the developed trade of today and the claims of the world\r\nto the productive powers of such an extraordinarily fruitful soil, the\r\nold restrictions can no longer be maintained, and the lately-introduced\r\nliberal tariff must be hailed as a thoroughly well-timed measure.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n[Galleon story sidelight on colonial history.]  The oft-mentioned\r\nvoyages of the galleons betwixt Manila and Acapulco hold such a\r\nprominent position in the history of the Philippines, and afford\r\nsuch an interesting glimpse into the old colonial system, that their\r\nprincipal characteristics deserve some description.\r\n\r\n[Chinese part in galleon trade.]  In the days of Morga, towards the\r\nclose of the sixteenth century, from thirty to forty Chinese junks\r\nwere in the habit of annually visiting Manila (generally in March);\r\ntowards the end of June a galleon used to sail for Acapulco. The trade\r\nwith the latter place, the active operations of which were limited to\r\nthe three central months of the year, was so lucrative, easy, and safe,\r\nthat the Spaniards scarcely cared to engage in any other undertakings.\r\n\r\n[Favoritism in allotment of cargo space.]  As the carrying power of\r\nthe annual galleon was by no means proportioned to the demand for\r\ncargo room, the governor divided it as he deemed best; the favorites,\r\nhowever, to whom he assigned shares in the hold, seldom traded\r\nthemselves, but parted with their concessions to the merchants.\r\n\r\n[Division of space and character of cargo.] According to De Guignes,\r\n[27] the hold of the vessel was divided into 1,500 parts, of which\r\nthe majority were allotted to the priests, and the rest to favored\r\npersons. As a matter of fact, the value of the cargo, which was\r\nofficially limited to $600,000, was considerably higher. It chiefly\r\nconsisted of Indian and Chinese cottons and silk stuffs (amongst\r\nothers fifty thousand pairs of silk stockings from China), and gold\r\nornaments. The value of the return freight amounted to between two\r\nand three millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n[Profit in trade.] Everything in this trade was settled beforehand;\r\nthe number, shape, size, and value of the bales, and even their selling\r\nprice. As this was usually double the original cost, the permission\r\nto ship goods to a certain amount was equivalent, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, to the bestowal of a present of a like value. These\r\npermissions or licenses (boletas) were, at a later period, usually\r\ngranted to pensioners and officers' widows, and to officials, in lieu\r\nof an increase of salary; these favorites were forbidden, however,\r\nto make a direct use of them, for to trade with Acapulco was the\r\nsole right of those members of the Consulado (a kind of chamber of\r\ncommerce) who could prove a long residence in the country and the\r\npossession of a capital of at least $8,000.\r\n\r\n[Evasion of regulations.] Legentil, the astronomer, gives a full\r\ndescription of the regulations which prevailed in his day and the\r\nmanner in which they were disobeyed. The cargo consisted of a thousand\r\nbales, each composed of four packets, [28] the maximum value of each\r\npacket being fixed at $250. It was impossible to increase the amount of\r\nbales, but they pretty generally consisted of more than four packets,\r\nand their value so far exceeded the prescribed limits, that a boleta\r\nwas considered to be worth from $200 to $225. The officials took good\r\ncare that no goods should be smuggled on board without a boleta. These\r\nwere in such demand, that, at a later period, Comyn [29] saw people\r\npay $500 for the right to ship goods, the value of which scarcely\r\namounted to $1,000. The merchants usually borrowed the money for these\r\nundertakings from the obras pias, charitable foundations, which, up\r\nto our own time, fulfil in the Islands the purposes of banks. [30]\r\nIn the early days of the trade, the galleon used to leave Cavite in\r\nJuly and sail with a south-westerly wind beyond the tropics, until\r\nit met with a west wind at the thirty-eighth or [Route outward.]\r\nfortieth parallel. [31] Later on the vessels were ordered to leave\r\nCavite with the first south-westerly winds to sail along the south\r\ncoast of Luzon, through San Bernardino straits, and to continue along\r\nthe thirteenth parallel of north latitude [32] as far to the east as\r\npossible, until the north-easterly trade wind compelled them to seek a\r\nnorth-west breeze in higher latitudes. They were then obliged to try\r\nthe thirtieth parallel as long as possible, instead of, as formerly,\r\nthe thirty-seventh. The captain of the galleon was not permitted\r\nto sail immediately northward, although to have done so would have\r\nprocured him a much quicker and safer passage, and would have enabled\r\nhim to reach the rainy zone more rapidly. To effect the last, indeed,\r\nwas a matter of the greatest importance to him, for his vessel,\r\noverladen [Water-supply crowded out by cargo.]  with merchandise,\r\nhad but little room crowded out for water; and although he had\r\na crew of from four hundred to six hundred hands to provide for,\r\nhe was instructed to depend upon the rain he caught on the voyage;\r\nfor which purpose, the galleon was provided with suitable mats and\r\nbamboo pails. [33]\r\n\r\n[Length of voyage.] Voyages in these low latitudes were, owing to the\r\ninconstancy of the winds, extremely troublesome, and often lasted five\r\nmonths and upwards. The fear of exposing the costly, cumbrous vessel\r\nto the powerful and sometimes stormy winds of the higher latitudes,\r\nappears to have been the cause of these sailing orders.\r\n\r\n[California landfall.] As soon as the galleon had passed the great\r\nSargasso shoal, it took a southerly course, and touched at the\r\nsouthern point of the Californian peninsula (San Lucas), where news\r\nand provisions awaited it. [34] In their earlier voyages, however,\r\nthey must have sailed much further to the north, somewhere in the\r\nneighborhood of Cape Mendocino, and have been driven southward in sight\r\nof the coast; for Vizcaino, in the voyage of discovery he undertook\r\nin 1603, from Mexico to California, found the principal mountains and\r\ncapes, although no European had ever set his foot upon them, already\r\nchristened by the galleons, to which they had served as landmarks.\r\n[35]\r\n\r\n[Speedy return voyage.] The return voyage to the Philippines was an\r\neasy one, and only occupied from forty to sixty days. [36] The galleon\r\nleft Acapulco in February or March, sailed southwards till it fell in\r\nwith the trade wind (generally in from 10° to 11° of north latitude),\r\nwhich carried it easily to the Ladrone Islands, and thence reached\r\nManila by way of Samar. [37]\r\n\r\n[Galleon's size and armament.] A galleon was usually of from twelve\r\nhundred to fifteen hundred tons burden, and carried fifty or sixty\r\nguns. The latter, however, were pretty generally banished to the\r\nhold during the eastward voyage. When the ship's bows were turned\r\ntowards home, and there was no longer any press of space, the guns\r\nwere remounted.\r\n\r\n[Capture of \"Santa Anna\".] San Augustin says of the Santa Anna, which\r\nThomas Candish captured and burnt in 1586 off the Californian coast:\r\n\"Our people sailed so carelessly that they used their guns for ballast;\r\n.... the pirate's venture was such a fortunate one that he returned\r\nto London with sails of Chinese damask and silken rigging.\" The cargo\r\nwas sold in Acapulco at a profit of 100 per cent., and was paid for\r\nin silver, cochineal, quicksilver, etc. [Value of return freight]\r\nThe total value of the return freight amounted perhaps to between\r\ntwo and three million dollars, [38] of which a quarter of a million,\r\nat least, fell to the king.\r\n\r\n[Gambling rather than commerce] The return of a galleon to Manila,\r\nladen with silver dollars and new arrivals, was a great holiday\r\nfor the colony. A considerable portion of the riches they had won\r\nas easily as at the gaming table, was soon spent by the crew; when\r\nmatters again returned to their usual lethargic state. It was no\r\nunfrequent event, however, for vessels to be lost. They were too\r\noften laden with a total disregard to seaworthiness, and wretchedly\r\nhandled. It was favor, not capacity, that determined the patronage\r\nof these lucrative appointments. [39] Many galleons fell into the\r\nhands of English and Dutch cruisers. [40] [\"Philippine Company\"\r\nand smugglers cause change.] But these tremendous profits gradually\r\ndecreased as the Compañía obtained the right to import Indian\r\ncottons, one of the principal articles of trade, into New Spain by\r\nway of Vera Cruz, subject to a customs duty of 6 per cent; and when\r\nEnglish and American adventurers began to smuggle these and other\r\ngoods into the country. [41] [Spanish coins in circulation on China\r\ncoast.] Finally, it may be mentioned that Spanish dollars found their\r\nway in the galleons to China and the further Indies, where they are\r\nin circulation to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n[The walled city of Manila.] The city proper of Manila, inhabited by\r\nSpaniards, Creoles, the Filipinos directly connected with them, and\r\nChinese, lies, surrounded by walls and wide ditches, on the left or\r\nsouthern bank of the Pasig, looking towards the sea. [42] It is a hot,\r\ndried-up place, full of monasteries, convents, barracks, and government\r\nbuildings. Safety, not appearance, was the object of its builders. It\r\nreminds the beholder of a Spanish provincial town, and is, next to Goa,\r\nthe oldest city in the Indies. Foreigners reside on the northern bank\r\nof the river; in Binondo, the headquarters of wholesale and retail\r\ncommerce, or in the pleasant suburban villages, which blend into\r\na considerable whole. [Population.] The total population of city\r\nand suburbs has been estimated, perhaps with some exaggeration,\r\nat 200,000. [Bridges.] A handsome old stone bridge of ten arches\r\nserves as the communication between the two banks of the Pasig,\r\nwhich, more recently, has also been spanned by an iron suspension\r\nbridge. [43] Very little intercourse exists between the inhabitants\r\nof Manila and Binondo. [Friction between classes.] Life in the city\r\nproper cannot be very pleasant; pride, envy, place-hunting, and caste\r\nhatred, are the order of the day; the Spaniards consider themselves\r\nsuperior to the creoles, who, in their turn, reproach the former with\r\nthe taunt that they have only come to the colony to save themselves\r\nfrom starvation. A similar hatred and envy exists between the whites\r\nand the mestizos. This state of things is to be found in all Spanish\r\ncolonies, and is chiefly caused by the colonial policy of Madrid,\r\nwhich always does its best to sow discord between the different races\r\nand classes of its foreign possessions, under the idea that their\r\nunion would imperil the sway of the mother country. [44]\r\n\r\n[Few large landowners.] In Manila, moreover, this state of things was\r\nrendered worse by the fact that the planter class, whose large landed\r\npossessions always give it a strong interest in the country of its\r\ninhabitance, was entirely wanting. At the present day, however, the\r\nincreasing demand for the produce of the colony seems to be bringing\r\nabout a pleasant change in this respect. [Spaniards transient.] The\r\nmanner in which the Spanish population of the Islands was affected\r\nby the gambling ventures of the galleons, at one time the only\r\nsource of commercial wealth, is thus described by Murillo Velarde\r\n(page 272):--\"The Spaniards who settle here look upon these Islands\r\nas a tavern rather than a permanent home. If they marry, it is by the\r\nmerest chance; where can a family be found that has been settled here\r\nfor several generations? The father amasses wealth, the son spends it,\r\nthe grandson is a beggar. The largest capitals are not more stable than\r\nthe waves of the ocean, across the crests of which they were gathered.\"\r\n\r\n[Discomforts and the high cost of living.] There is nothing like\r\nthe same amount of sociability amongst the foreigners in Binondo as\r\nprevails in English and Dutch colonies; and scarcely any intercourse at\r\nall with the Spaniards, who envy the strangers and almost seem to look\r\nupon the gains the latter make in the country as so many robberies\r\ncommitted upon themselves, its owners. Besides all this, living is\r\nvery expensive, much more so than in Singapore and Batavia. To many,\r\nthe mere cost of existence seems greatly out of proportion to their\r\nofficial salaries. The (European style) houses, which are generally\r\nspacious, are gloomy and ugly, and not well ventilated for such a\r\nclimate. Instead of light jalousies, they are fitted with heavy sash\r\nwindows, which admit the light through thin oyster shells, forming\r\nsmall panes scarcely two square inches in area, and held together by\r\nlaths an inch thick. The ground floors of the houses are, on account\r\nof the great damp, sensibly enough, generally uninhabited; and are\r\nused as cellars, stables, and servant's offices.\r\n\r\n[Native houses comfortable and unchanged.] The unassuming, but for\r\ntheir purposes very practical houses, of boards, bamboos, and (nipa)\r\npalm leaves, are supported on account of the damp on isolated beams\r\nor props; and the space beneath, which is generally fenced in with\r\na railing, is used as a stable or a warehouse; such was the case\r\nas early as the days of Magellan. These dwellings [45] are very\r\nlightly put together. La Pérouse estimates the weight of some of them,\r\nfurniture and all, at something less than two hundred pounds. Nearly\r\nall these houses, as well as the huts of the natives, are furnished\r\nwith an azotea, that is, an uncovered space, on the same level as the\r\ndwelling, which takes the place of yard and balcony. The Spaniards\r\nappear to have copied this useful contrivance from the Moors, but the\r\nnatives were acquainted with them before the arrival of the Europeans,\r\nfor Morga mentions similar batalanes.\r\n\r\n[Neglected river and canals offensive.] In the suburbs nearly every\r\nhut stands in its own garden. The river is often quite covered with\r\ngreen scum; and dead cats and dogs surrounded with weeds, which look\r\nlike cabbage-lettuce, frequently adorn its waters. In the dry season,\r\nthe numerous canals of the suburbs are so many stagnant drains,\r\nand at each ebb of the tide the ditches around the town exhibit a\r\nsimilar spectacle.\r\n\r\n[Dreary and unprogressive life.] Manila offers very few opportunities\r\nfor amusement. There was no Spanish theatre open during my stay there,\r\nbut Tagalog plays (translations) were sometimes represented. The town\r\npossessed no club, and contained no readable books. Never once did\r\nthe least excitement enliven its feeble newspapers, for the items\r\nof intelligence, forwarded fortnightly from Hongkong, were sifted by\r\npriestly censors, who left little but the chronicles of the Spanish\r\nand French courts to feed the barren columns of the local sheets. [46]\r\nThe pompously celebrated religious festivals were the only events\r\nthat sometimes chequered the wearisome monotony.\r\n\r\n[Cock-fighting.] The chief amusement of the Filipinos is cock-fighting,\r\nwhich is carried on with a passionate eagerness that must strike every\r\nstranger. Nearly every man keeps a fighting cock. Many are never seen\r\nout of doors without their favorite in their arms; they pay as much\r\nas $50 and upwards for these pets, and heap the tenderest caresses\r\non them. The passion for cock-fighting can well be termed a national\r\nvice; but the practice may have been introduced by the Spaniards, or\r\nthe Mexicans who accompanied them, as, in a like manner, the habit of\r\nsmoking opium among the Chinese, which has become a national curse,\r\nwas first introduced by the English. [Probably Malay Custom.] It is,\r\nhowever, more probable that the Malays brought the custom into the\r\ncountry. In the eastern portion of the Philippines, cock-fighting\r\nwas unknown in the days of Pigafetta. The first cock-fight he met\r\nwith was at Palawan. \"They keep large cocks, which from a species of\r\nsuperstition, they never eat, but keep for fighting purposes. Heavy\r\nbets are made on the upshot of the contest, which are paid to the\r\nowner of the winning bird.\" [47] The sight is one extremely repulsive\r\nto Europeans. [The cockpit.] The ring around the cockpit is crowded\r\nwith men, perspiring at every pore, while their countenances bear\r\nthe imprint of the ugliest passions. Each bird is armed with a sharp\r\ncurved spur, three inches long capable of making deep wounds, and which\r\nalways causes the death of one or both birds by the serious injuries it\r\ninflicts. If a cock shows symptoms of fear and declines the encounter,\r\nit is plucked alive. Incredibly large sums, in proportion to the means\r\nof the gamblers, are wagered on the result. [Its bad influence.] It\r\nis very evident that these cock-fights must have a most demoralising\r\neffect upon a people so addicted to idleness and dissipation, and so\r\naccustomed to give way to the impulse of the moment. Their effect\r\nis to make them little able to resist the temptation of procuring\r\nmoney without working for it. The passion for the game leads many\r\nto borrow at usury, to embezzlement, to theft, and even to  highway\r\nrobbery. The land and sea pirates, of whom I shall speak presently,\r\nare principally composed of ruined gamesters. [48]\r\n\r\n[Feminine attractiveness.] In the comeliness of the women who\r\nlend animation to its streets Manila surpasses all other towns in\r\nthe Indian Archipelago. Mallat describes them in glowing colors. A\r\ncharming picture of Manila street life, full of local color, is given\r\nin the very amusing Aventures d'un Gentilhomme Breton. [49]\r\n\r\n[Mestizas.] How many of the prettiest Filipinas are of perfectly\r\nunmixed blood, it is, I confess, difficult to decide. Many of them\r\nare very fair and of quite an European type, and are thereby easily\r\ndistinguished from their sisters in the outlying provinces. The\r\nimmediate environs of Manila can boast many beautiful spots, but\r\nthey are not the resort of the local rank and fashion, the object\r\nof whose daily promenade is the display of their toilettes, and not\r\nthe enjoyment of nature. In the hot season, all who can afford it\r\nare driven every evening along the [The Luneta.] dusty streets to\r\na promenade on the beach, which was built a short time back, where\r\nseveral times a week the band of a native regiment plays fairly good\r\nmusic, and there walk formally up and down. All the Spaniards [The\r\nAngelas.] are in uniform or in black frock coats. When the bells ring\r\nout for evening prayer, carriages, horsemen, pedestrians, all suddenly\r\nstand motionless; the men take off their hats, and everybody appears\r\nmomentarily absorbed in prayer.\r\n\r\n[Botanical gardens.] The same governor who laid out the promenade\r\nestablished a botanical garden. It is true that everything he planted\r\nin it, exposed on a marshy soil to the full heat of a powerful sun,\r\nsoon faded away; but its ground was enclosed and laid out, and though\r\nit was overgrown with weeds, it had at least received a name. At\r\npresent it is said to be in better condition. [50]\r\n\r\n[Pretty girls in gay garments.] The religious festivals in the\r\nneighborhood of Manila are well worth a visit, if only for the sake\r\nof the numerous pretty Filipinas and mestizas in their best clothes\r\nwho make their appearance in the evening and promenade up and down\r\nthe streets, which are illuminated and profusely decked with flowers\r\nand bright colors. They offer a charming spectacle, particularly\r\nto a stranger lately arrived from Malaysia. The Filipinas are very\r\nbeautifully formed. They have luxuriant black hair, and large dark\r\neyes; the upper part of their bodies is clad in a homespun but often\r\ncostly material of transparent fineness and snow-white purity; and,\r\nfrom their waist downwards, they are wrapped in a brightly-striped\r\ncloth (saya), which falls in broad folds, and which, as far as the\r\nknee, is so tightly compressed with a dark shawl (lapis), closely drawn\r\naround the figure, that the rich variegated folds of the saya burst\r\nout beneath it like the blossoms of a pomegranate. This swathing only\r\nallows the young girls to take very short steps, and this timidity of\r\ngait, in unison with their downcast eyes, gives them a very modest\r\nappearance. On their naked feet they wear embroidered slippers of\r\nsuch a small size that their little toes protrude for want of room,\r\nand grasp the outside of the sandal. [51]\r\n\r\n[Dress of the poorer women.] The poorer women clothe themselves in a\r\nsaya and in a so-called chemise, which is so extremely short that it\r\nfrequently does not even reach the first fold of the former. In the\r\nmore eastern islands grown-up girls and women wear, with the exception\r\nof a Catholic amulet, nothing but these two garments, which are,\r\nparticularly after bathing, and before they get dried by the sun,\r\nnearly transparent.\r\n\r\n[Men's clothing.] A hat, trousers, and a shirt worn outside them,\r\nboth made of coarse Guinara cloth, compose the dress of the men of\r\nthe poorer classes. The shirts worn by the wealthy are often made\r\nof an extremely expensive home-made material, woven from the fibers\r\nof the pineapple or the banana. Some of them are ornamented with\r\nsilk stripes, some are plain. They are also frequently manufactured\r\nentirely of jusi (Chinese floret silk), in which case they will not\r\nstand washing, and can only be worn once. The hat (salacot), a round\r\npiece of home-made plaiting, is used as both umbrella and sunshade,\r\nand is often adorned with silver ornaments of considerable value. [The\r\n\"Principales\".] The principalia class enjoy the special privilege\r\nof wearing short jackets above their shirts, and are usually easily\r\nrecognizable by their amusing assumption of dignity, and by the faded\r\ncylindrical hats, yellow with age, family heirlooms, constantly\r\nworn. [The dandies.] The native dandies wear patent leather shoes\r\non their naked feet, tight-fitting trousers of some material striped\r\nwith black and white or with some other glaringly-contrasted colors,\r\na starched plaited shirt of European make, a chimney-pot silk hat,\r\nand carry a cane in their hands. [The servants.] The servants waiting\r\nat dinner in their white starched shirts and trousers are by no means\r\nan agreeable spectacle, and I never realised the full ludicrousness\r\nof European male costume till my eye fell upon its caricature,\r\nexemplified in the person of a \"Manila dandy.\"\r\n\r\n[Mestiza costume.] The mestizas dress like the Filipinas, but do not\r\nwear the tapis, and those of them who are married to Europeans are\r\ngenerally clad in both shoes and stockings. Many of the mestizas are\r\nextremely pretty, but their gait drags a little, from their habit of\r\nwearing slippers. As a rule they are prudent, thrifty, and [Clever\r\nbusiness women.] clever business women, but their conversation is\r\noften awkward and tedious. Their want of education is, however, not\r\nthe cause of this latter failing, for Andalusian women who never learn\r\nanything but the elementary doctrines of Christianity, are among the\r\nmost charming creatures in the world, in their youth. [Ill at ease\r\nin society.] Its cause lies rather in this equivocal position; they\r\nare haughtily repelled by their white sisters, whilst they themselves\r\ndisown their mother's kin. They are wanting in the ease, in the tact,\r\nthat the women of Spain show in every relation of existence.\r\n\r\n[Mestizos.] The mestizos, particularly those born of Chinese and Tagal\r\nmothers, constitute the richest and the most enterprising portion of\r\nthe native population. They are well acquainted with all the good and\r\nbad qualities of the Filipino inhabitants, and use them unscrupulously\r\nfor their own purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n[Native distrust of Europeans.] A Scotch merchant to whom I brought\r\na letter of introduction invited me with such cordiality to come\r\nand stay with him, that I found myself unable to refuse. While thus\r\nliving under the roof and protection of one of the wealthiest and most\r\nrespected men in the city, the cabmen I employed insisted on being\r\npaid beforehand every time I rode in their vehicles. This distrust was\r\noccasioned by the scanty feeling of respect most of the Europeans in\r\nManila inspired in the minds of the natives. Many later observations\r\nconfirmed this impression. What a different state of things exists\r\nin Java and Singapore! The reason, however, is easily explained.\r\n\r\n[Dutch and English stand well in their colonies.] The Dutch are as\r\nlittle able as the English to acclimatize themselves in tropical\r\ncountries. They get all they can out of countries in which they are\r\nonly temporary sojourners, the former by forced service and monopoly,\r\nthe latter by commerce. In both cases, however, the end is accomplished\r\nby comparatively few individuals, whose official position and the\r\nlargeness of whose undertakings place them far above the mass of the\r\npopulation. In Java, moreover, the Europeans constitute the governing\r\nclasses, the natives the governed; and even in Singapore where both\r\nraces are equal before the law the few white men understand how to mark\r\nthe difference of race so distinctively that the natives without demur\r\nsurrender to them, though not by means of the law, the privileges of a\r\nhigher caste. The difference of religion does but widen the gap; and,\r\nfinally, every European there speaks the language of the country, while\r\nthe natives are totally ignorant of that spoken by the foreigners.\r\n\r\n[Dutch colonials well educated.] The Dutch officials are educated at\r\nhome in schools specially devoted to the East Indian service. The art\r\nof managing the natives, the upholding of prestige, which is considered\r\nthe secret of the Dutch power over the numerous native populations,\r\nforms an essential particular in their education. The Dutch, therefore,\r\nmanage their intercourse with the natives, no matter how much they\r\nintend to get out of them, in strict accordance with customary usage\r\n(adat); they never wound the natives' amor propio and never expose\r\nthemselves in their own mutual intercourse, which remains a sealed\r\nbook to the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Spanish officials undesirables.] Things are different in the\r\nPhilippines. With the exception of those officials whose stay is\r\nlimited by the rules of the service, or by the place-hunting that\r\nensues at every change in the Spanish ministry, few Spaniards who\r\nhave once settled in the colony ever return home. It is forbidden\r\nto the priests, and most of the rest have no means of doing so. A\r\nconsiderable portion of them consist of subaltern officers, soldiers,\r\nsailors, political delinquents and refugees whom the mother-country\r\nhas got rid of; and not seldom of adventurers deficient both in means\r\nand desire for the journey back, for their life in the colony is far\r\npleasanter than that they were forced to lead in Spain. These latter\r\narrive without the slightest knowledge of the country and without\r\nbeing in the least prepared for a sojourn there. Many of them are so\r\nlazy that they won't take the trouble to learn the language even if\r\nthey marry a daughter of the soil. Their servants understand Spanish,\r\nand clandestinely watch the conversation and the actions, and become\r\nacquainted with all the secrets, of their indiscreet masters, to\r\nwhom the Filipinos remain an enigma which their conceit prevents them\r\nattempting to decipher.\r\n\r\n[Spanish lack of prestige deserved.] It is easy to understand how\r\nFilipino respect for Europeans must be diminished by the numbers of\r\nthese uneducated, improvident, and extravagant Spaniards, who, no\r\nmatter what may have been their position at home, are all determined\r\nto play the master in the colony. [Social Standing of Filipinos thus\r\nenhanced.] The relative standing of the Filipinos naturally profits\r\nby all this and it would be difficult to find a colony in which\r\nthe natives, taken all in all, feel more comfortable than in the\r\nPhilippines. They have adopted the religion, the manners, and the\r\ncustoms of their rulers; and though legally not on an equal footing\r\nwith the latter, they are by no means separated from them by the\r\nhigh barriers with which, not to mention Java, the churlish reserve\r\nof the English has surrounded the natives of the other colonies.\r\n\r\n[Spanish-Filipino bonds of union.] The same religion, a similar form\r\nof worship, an existence intermixed with that of the indigenous\r\npopulation, all tend to bring the Europeans and the Indians\r\ntogether. That they have done so is proved by the existence of the\r\nproportionately very numerous band of mestizos who inhabit the Islands.\r\n\r\n[Latin races better for colonists in the tropics.] The Spaniards\r\nand the Portuguese appear, in fact, to be the only Europeans who\r\ntake root in tropical countries. They are capable of permanent and\r\nfruitful amalgamation [52] with the natives. [53]\r\n\r\n[Initiative and individuality missing.] The want of originality, which\r\namong the mestizos, appears to arise from their equivocal position,\r\nis also to be found among the natives. Distinctly marked national\r\ncustoms, which one would naturally expect to find in such an isolated\r\npart of the world, are sought for in vain, and again and again the\r\nstranger remarks that everything has been learned and is only a veneer.\r\n\r\n[A compromise civilization.] As Spain forcibly expelled the\r\ncivilization of the Moors, and in Peru that of the Incas, so in the\r\nPhilippines it has understood how to set aside an equally well-founded\r\none, by appropriating in an incredible manner, in order to take root\r\nitself the more quickly, all existing forms and abuses. [54]\r\n\r\n[Imitation instilled and self-respect banished.] The uncivilized\r\ninhabitants of the Philippines quickly adopted the rites, forms,\r\nand ceremonies of the strange religion, and, at the same time, copied\r\nthe personal externalities of their new masters, learning to despise\r\ntheir own manners and customs as heathenish and barbarian. Nowadays,\r\nforsooth, they sing Andalusian songs, and dance Spanish dances; but\r\nin what sort of way? They imitate everything that passes before their\r\neyes without using their intelligence to appreciate it. It is this\r\nwhich makes both themselves and their artistic productions wearisome,\r\ndevoid of character, and, I may add, unnatural, in spite of the skill\r\nand patience they devote to them. These two peculiarities, moreover,\r\nare invariably to be found amongst nations whose civilization is but\r\nlittle developed; the patience so much admired is often nothing but\r\nwaste of time and breath, quite out of proportion to the end in view,\r\nand the skill is the mere consequence of the backward state of the\r\ndivision of labor.\r\n\r\n[Educated Filipino unnatural.] If I entered the house of a well-to-do\r\nFilipino, who spoke Spanish, I was received with the same phrases his\r\nmodel, a Spaniard, would employ; but I always had the feeling that it\r\nwas out of place. In countries where the native population remains\r\ntrue to its ancient customs this is not the case; and whenever I\r\nhave not been received with proper respect, I have remarked that the\r\napparent fact proceeded from a difference in social forms, not more\r\nto be wondered at than a difference in weights and measures. In Java,\r\nand particularly in Borneo and the Moluccas, the utensils in daily use\r\nare ornamented with so refined a feeling for form and color, that they\r\nare praised by our artists as patterns of ornamentation and afford\r\na proof that the labor is one of love, and that it is presided over\r\nby an acute intelligence. [Native art-sense spoiled.] Such a sense\r\nof beauty is seldom to be met with in the Philippines. Everything\r\nthere is imitation or careless makeshift. Even the piña embroideries,\r\nwhich are fabricated with such wonderful patience and skill, and\r\nare so celebrated for the fineness of the work, are, as a rule,\r\nspiritless imitations of Spanish patterns. One is involuntarily\r\nled to these conclusions by a comparison of the art products of the\r\nSpanish-American communities with those of more barbarous races. The\r\nBerlin Ethnographical Museum contains many proofs of the facts I have\r\njust mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Indolence from absence of incentive.] The oars used in the\r\nPhilippines are usually made of bamboo poles, with a board tied to\r\ntheir extremities with strips of rattan. If they happen to break, so\r\nmuch the better; for the fatiguing labor of rowing must necessarily\r\nbe suspended till they are mended again.\r\n\r\n[Carelessness from lack of responsibility.] In Java the carabao-carts,\r\nwhich are completely covered in as a protection against the rain,\r\nare ornamented with many tasteful patterns. The roofless wagons used\r\nin the Philippines are roughly put together at the last moment. When\r\nit is necessary to protect their contents from the wet, an old pair\r\nof mats is thrown over them, more for the purpose of appeasing the\r\nprejudices of the \"Castilians\" than really to keep off the rain.\r\n\r\n[Weakened character and want of dignity.] The English and the Dutch are\r\nalways looked upon as strangers in the tropics; their influence never\r\ntouches the ancient native customs which culminate in the religion of\r\nthe country. But the populations whom the Spaniards have converted to\r\ntheir religion have lost all originality, all sense of nationality;\r\nyet the alien religion has never really penetrated into their inmost\r\nbeing, they never feel it to be a source of moral support, and it is\r\nno accidental coincidence that they are all more or less stamped with\r\na want of dignity....\r\n\r\n[Spanish rule not benevolent, but beneficial.] With the exception of\r\nthis want of national individuality, and the loss of the distinguishing\r\nmanners and customs which constitute the chief charm of most eastern\r\npeoples, the Filipino is an interesting study of a type of mankind\r\nexisting in the easiest natural conditions. The arbitrary rule of\r\ntheir chiefs, and the iron shackles of slavery, were abolished by the\r\nSpaniards shortly after their arrival; and peace and security reigned\r\nin the place of war and rapine. The Spanish rule in these Islands was\r\nalways a mild one, not because the laws, which treated the natives\r\nlike children, were wonderfully gentle, but because the causes did\r\nnot exist which caused such scandalous cruelties in Spanish America\r\nand in the colonies of other nations.\r\n\r\n[Circumstances have favored the Filipinos.] It was fortunate for\r\nthe Filipinos that their islands possessed no wealth in the shape of\r\nprecious metals or valuable spices. In the earlier days of maritime\r\ntraffic there was little possibility of exporting the numerous\r\nagricultural productions of the colony; and it was scarcely worth\r\nwhile, therefore, to make the most of the land. The few Spaniards\r\nwho resided in the colony found such an easy method of making money\r\nin the commerce with China and Mexico, by means of the galleons,\r\nthat they held themselves aloof from all economical enterprises,\r\nwhich had little attraction for their haughty inclinations, and\r\nwould have imposed the severest labor on the Filipinos. Taking into\r\nconsideration the wearisome and dangerous navigation of the time,\r\nit was, moreover, impossible for the Spaniards, upon whom their too\r\nlarge possessions in America already imposed an exhausting man-tax,\r\nto maintain a strong armed force in the Philippines. The subjection,\r\nwhich had been inaugurated by a dazzling military exploit, was chiefly\r\naccomplished by the assistance of the friar orders, whose missionaries\r\nwere taught to employ extreme prudence and patience. The Philippines\r\nwere thus principally won by a peaceful conquest.\r\n\r\n[Have fared better than the Mexicans.] The taxes laid upon the peoples\r\nwere so trifling that they did not suffice for the administration\r\nof the colony. The difference was covered by yearly contributions\r\nfrom Mexico. The extortions of unconscientious officials were by no\r\nmeans conspicuous by their absence. Cruelties, however, such as were\r\npractised in the American mining districts, or in the manufactures\r\nof Quito, never occurred in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[A land of opportunity.] Uncultivated land was free, and was at\r\nthe service of any one willing to make it productive; if, however,\r\nit remained untilled for two years, it reverted to the crown. [55]\r\n\r\n[Low taxes.] The only tax which the Filipinos pay is the poll-tax,\r\nknown as the tributo, which originally, three hundred years ago,\r\namounted to one dollar for every pair of adults, and in a country\r\nwhere all marry early, and the sexes are equally divided, really\r\nconstituted a family-tax. By degrees the tribute has been raised to\r\ntwo and one-sixteenth dollars. An adult, therefore, male or female,\r\npays one and one-thirty-second dollar, and that from his sixteenth to\r\nhis sixtieth year. Besides this, every man has to give forty days'\r\nlabor every year to the State. This vassalage (polos y servicios)\r\nis divided into ordinary and extraordinary services: the first\r\nconsists of the duties appertaining to a watchman or messenger, in\r\ncleaning the courts of justice, and in other light labors; the second\r\nin road-making, and similar heavier kinds of work, for the benefit\r\nof villages and provinces. The little use, however, that is made of\r\nthese services, is shown by the fact that any one can obtain a release\r\nfrom them for a sum which at most is not more than three dollars. No\r\npersonal service is required of women. A little further on, important\r\ndetails about the tax from official sources, which were placed at my\r\ndisposal in the colonial office, appear in a short special chapter.\r\n\r\n[Fortunate factors.] In other countries, with an equally mild climate,\r\nand an equally fertile soil, the natives, unless they had reached a\r\nhigher degree of civilization than that of the Philippine Islanders,\r\nwould have been ground down by native princes, or ruthlessly plundered\r\nand destroyed by foreigners. In these isolated Islands, so richly\r\nendowed by nature, where pressure from above, impulse from within,\r\nand every stimulus from the outside are wanting, the satisfaction\r\nof a few trifling wants is sufficient for an existence with ample\r\ncomfort. Of all countries in the world, the Philippines have the\r\ngreatest claim to be considered a lotos-eating Utopia. The traveller,\r\nwhose knowledge of the dolce far niente is derived from Naples,\r\nhas no real appreciation of it; it only blossoms under the shade of\r\npalm-trees. These notes of travel will contain plenty of examples to\r\nsupport this. One trip across the Pasig gives a foretaste of life\r\nin the interior of the country. Low wooden cabins and bamboo huts,\r\nsurmounted with green foliage and blossoming flowers, are picturesquely\r\ngrouped with areca palms, and tall, feather-headed bamboos, upon its\r\nbanks. Sometimes the enclosures run down into the stream itself, some\r\nof them being duck-grounds, and others bathing-places. The shore is\r\nfringed with canoes, nets, rafts, and fishing apparatus. Heavily-laden\r\nboats float down the stream, and small canoes ply from bank to bank\r\nbetween the groups of bathers. The most lively traffic is to be seen\r\nin the tiendas, large sheds, corresponding to the Javanese harongs,\r\nwhich open upon the river, the great channel for traffic.\r\n\r\n[River resorts.] They are a source of great attraction to the\r\npassing sailors, who resort to them for eating, drinking, and other\r\nconvivialities; and while away the time there in gambling, betel\r\nchewing, and smoking, with idle companions of both sexes.\r\n\r\n[Sleeping pilots.] At times somebody may be seen floating down\r\nthe stream asleep on a heap of coconuts. If the nuts run ashore,\r\nthe sleeper rouses himself, pushes off with a long bamboo, and\r\ncontentedly relapses into slumber, as his eccentric raft regains\r\nthe current of the river. One cut of his bolo-knife easily detaches\r\nsufficient of the husk of the nuts to allow of their being fastened\r\ntogether; in this way a kind of wreath is formed which encircles and\r\nholds together the loose nuts piled up in the middle.\r\n\r\n[Labor-saving conditions.] The arduous labors of many centuries\r\nhave left as their legacy a perfect system of transport; but in\r\nthese Islands man can obtain many of his requirements direct with\r\nproportionately trifling labor, and a large amount of comfort for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[Easy food.] Off the Island of Talim, in the great Lagoon of Bay, my\r\nboatmen bought for a few cuartos several dozens of fish quite twelve\r\ninches long; and those which they couldn't eat were split open, salted,\r\nand dried by a few hours' exposure to the heat of the sun on the roof\r\nof the boat. When the fishermen had parted with their contemplated\r\nbreakfast, they stooped down and filled their cooking-vessels with\r\nsand-mussels (paludina costata, 2.a G.), first throwing away the\r\ndead ones from the handfuls they picked up from the bottom of the\r\nshallow water.\r\n\r\n[River's importance.] Nearly all the dwellings are built by the water's\r\nedge. The river is a natural self-maintaining highway, on which loads\r\ncan be carried to the foot of the mountains. The huts of the people,\r\nbuilt upon piles, are to be seen thickly scattered about its banks,\r\nand particularly about its broad mouths. The appropriateness of\r\ntheir position is evident, for the stream is at once the very\r\ncenter of activity and the most convenient spot for the pursuit\r\nof their callings. At each tide the takes of fish are more or less\r\nplentiful, and at low-water the women and children may be seen picking\r\nup shell-fish with their toes, for practice has enabled them to use\r\ntheir toes as deftly as their fingers, or gathering in the sand-crabs\r\nand eatable seaweed.\r\n\r\n[Riverside gaiety.]  The riverside is a pretty sight when men, women,\r\nand children are bathing and frolicking in the shade of the palm-trees;\r\nand others are filling their water-vessels, large bamboos, which they\r\ncarry on their shoulders, or jars, which they bear on their heads;\r\nand when the boys are standing upright on the broad backs of the\r\ncarabaos and riding triumphantly into the water.\r\n\r\n[Coco-palms.] It is here too that the coco-palm most flourishes, a tree\r\nthat supplies not only their food and drink, but also every material\r\nnecessary for the construction of huts and the manufacture of the\r\nvarious articles which they use. While the greatest care is necessary\r\nto make those growing further inland bear even a little fruit, the\r\npalm-trees close to the shore, even when planted on wretched soil,\r\ngrow plentiful crops without the slightest trouble. Has a palm-tree\r\never been made to blossom in a hothouse? Thomson [56] mentions that\r\ncoco-trees growing by the sea-side are wont to incline their stems over\r\nthe ocean, the waters of which bear their fruit to desert shores and\r\nislands, and render them habitable for mankind. Thus the coco-tree\r\nwould seem to play an essential part in the ocean vagabondage of\r\nMalaysia and Polynesia.\r\n\r\n[Nipa-palms.] Close to the coco-trees grow clumps of the stunted\r\nnipa-palms, which only flourish in brackish waters; [57] their\r\nleaves furnish the best roof-thatching. Sugar, brandy, and vinegar\r\nare manufactured from their sap. Three hundred and fifty years ago\r\nPigafetta found these manufactures in full swing, but nowadays\r\nthey seem to be limited to the Philippines. Besides these, the\r\npandanus-tree, from the leaves of which the softest mats are woven,\r\nis always found in near proximity to the shore.\r\n\r\n[Fertile fields.] Towards the interior the landscape is covered with\r\nrice-fields, which yearly receive a fresh layer of fertile soil,\r\nwashed down from the mountains by the river, and spread over their\r\nsurface by the overflowing of its waters; and which in consequence\r\nnever require any fertilizer. [The carabao.] The carabao, the favorite\r\ndomestic animal of the Malays, and which they keep especially for\r\nagricultural purposes, prefers these regions to all others. It loves\r\nto wallow in the mud, and is not fit for work unless permitted to\r\nfrequent the water.\r\n\r\n[Bamboo.] Bamboos with luxuriant leafy tops grow plentifully by the\r\nhuts in the rice-fields which fringe the banks of the river. In my\r\nformer sketches of travel I have endeavored to describe how much\r\nthis gigantic plant contributes to the comfort and convenience of\r\ntropical life. Since then I have become acquainted with many curious\r\npurposes to which it is turned, but to describe them here would be\r\nout of place.  [58] I may be allowed, however, to briefly cite a\r\nfew examples showing what numerous results are obtained from simple\r\nmeans. Nature has endowed these splendid plants, which perhaps surpass\r\nall others in beauty, with so many useful qualities, and delivered\r\nthem into the hands of mankind so ready for immediate use, that a\r\nfew sharp cuts suffice to convert them into all kinds of various\r\nutensils. [Strength.] The bamboo possesses, in proportion to its\r\nlightness, an extraordinary strength; the result of its round shape,\r\nand the regularity of the joints in its stem. The parallel position and\r\ntoughness of its fibers render it easy to split, and, when split, its\r\npieces are of extraordinary pliability and elasticity. To the gravelly\r\nsoil on which it grows it owes its durability, and its firm, even,\r\nand always clean surface, the brilliancy and color of which improve by\r\nuse. [Convenience.] And finally, it is a great thing for a population\r\nwith such limited means of conveyance that the bamboo is to be found\r\nin such abundance in all kinds of localities and of all dimensions,\r\nfrom a few millimeters to ten or fifteen centimeters in diameter,\r\neven sometimes to twice this amount; and that, on account of its\r\nunsurpassed floating power, it is pre-eminently fitted for locomotion\r\nin a country poor in roads but rich in watercourses. A blow with a bolo\r\nis generally enough to cut down a strong stem. [Usefulness.] If the\r\nthin joints are taken away, hollow stems of different thicknesses can\r\nbe slid into one another like the parts of a telescope. From bamboos\r\nsplit in half, gutters, troughs, and roofing tiles can be made. Split\r\ninto several slats, which can be again divided into small strips and\r\nfibers for the manufacture of baskets, ropes, mats, and fine plaiting\r\nwork, they can be made into frames and stands. Two cuts in the same\r\nplace make a round hole through which a stem of corresponding diameter\r\ncan be firmly introduced. If a similar opening is made in a second\r\nupright, the horizontal stem can be run through both. Gates, closing\r\nperpendicularly or horizontally in frames moving without friction on\r\na perpendicular or horizontal axis, can be made in this way.\r\n\r\nTwo deep cuts give an angular shape to the stem; and when its two sides\r\nare wide enough apart to admit of a cross-stem being placed between\r\nthem, they can be employed as roof-ridges or for the framework of\r\ntables and chairs; a quantity of flat split pieces of bamboo being\r\nfastened on top of them with chair-cane. These split pieces then\r\nform the seats of the chairs and the tops of the tables, instead of\r\nthe boards and large bamboo laths used at other times. It is equally\r\neasy to make an oblong opening in a large bamboo in which to fit the\r\nlaths of a stand.\r\n\r\nA couple of cuts are almost enough to make a fork, a pair of tongs\r\nor a hook.\r\n\r\nIf one makes a hole as big as the end of one's finger in a large\r\nbamboo close under a joint, one obtains by fastening a small piece of\r\ncloth to the open end, a syphon or a filter. If a piece of bamboo is\r\nsplit down to the joint in strips, and the strips be bound together\r\nwith others horizontally interlaced, it makes a conical basket. If\r\nthe strips are cut shorter, it makes a peddler's pack basket. If\r\na long handle is added, and it is filled with tar, it can be used\r\nas a signal torch. If shallower baskets of the same dimensions,\r\nbut with their bottoms cut off or punched out, are placed inside\r\nthese conical ones, the two together make capital snare baskets for\r\ncrabs and fish. If a bamboo stem be cut off just below the joint,\r\nand its lower edge be split up into a cogged rim, it makes, when the\r\npartition of the joint is punched out, an earth-auger, a fountain-pipe,\r\nand many things of the kind.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n[Pleasures of travel.] Strangers travelling in the interior have\r\ndaily fresh opportunities of enjoying the hospitality of nature. The\r\natmosphere is so equitably warm that one would gladly dispense with\r\nall clothing except a sun-hat and a pair of light shoes. Should one\r\nbe tempted to pass the night in the open air, the construction of a\r\nhut from the leaves of the palm and the fern is the work of a few\r\nminutes; [Village rest houses.] but in even the smallest village\r\nthe traveller finds a \"common house\" (casa real), in which he can\r\ntake up his quarters and be supplied with the necessaries of life\r\nat the market price. There too he will always meet with semaneros\r\n(those who perform menial duties) ready to serve him as messengers\r\nor porters for the most trifling remuneration. But long practice\r\nhas taught me that their services principally consist in doing\r\nnothing. On one occasion I wanted to send a man who was playing\r\ncards and drinking tuba (fresh or weakly-fermented palm-sap) with his\r\ncompanions, on an errand. [Pleasant prison life.] Without stopping his\r\ngame the fellow excused himself on the ground of being a prisoner,\r\nand one of his guardians proceeded in the midst of the intense heat\r\nto carry my troublesome message. Prisoners have certainly little\r\ncause to grumble. [Frequent floggings little regarded.] The only\r\ninconvenience to which they are exposed are the floggings which the\r\nlocal authorities very liberally dispense by the dozens for the most\r\ntrifling offences. Except the momentary bodily pain, however, these\r\nappear in most cases to make little impression on a people who have\r\nbeen accustomed to corporal punishment from their youth upwards. Their\r\nacquaintances stand round the sufferers, while the blows are being\r\ninflicted, and mockingly ask them how it tastes.\r\n\r\n[Change from Malayan character.] A long residence amongst the earnest,\r\nquiet, and dignified Malays, who are most anxious for their honor,\r\nwhile most submissive to their superiors, makes the contrast in\r\ncharacter exhibited by the natives of the Philippines, who yet belong\r\nto the Malay race, all the more striking. The change in their nature\r\nappears to be a natural consequence of the Spanish rule, for the same\r\ncharacteristics may be observed in the natives of Spanish America. The\r\nclass distinctions and the despotic oppression prevalent under their\r\nformer chiefs doubtless rendered the Filipinos of the past more like\r\nthe Malays of today.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n[The familiar field for travellers.] The environs of Manila, the Pasig,\r\nand the Lagoon of Bay, which are visited by every fresh arrival in the\r\ncolony, have been so often described that I have restricted myself\r\nto a few short notes upon these parts of the country, and intend to\r\nrelate in detail only my excursions into the south-eastern provinces\r\nof Luzon, Camarines, and Albay, and the islands which lie to the east\r\nof them, Samar and Leyte. Before doing this, however, it will not be\r\nout of place to glance at the map and give some slight description\r\nof their geographical conditions.\r\n\r\n[Archipelago's great extent.] The Philippine Archipelago lies between\r\nBorneo and Formosa, and separates the northern Pacific Ocean from the\r\nChina Sea. It covers fourteen and one-half degrees of latitude, and\r\nextends from the Sulu Islands in the south, in the fifth parallel of\r\nnorth latitude, to the Babuyans in the north in latitude 19° 30'. If,\r\nhowever, the Bashee or Batanes Islands be included, its area may be\r\nsaid to extend to the twenty-first parallel of north latitude. But\r\nneither southwards or northwards does Spanish rule extend to these\r\nextreme limits, nor, in fact, does it always reach the far interior\r\nof the larger islands. From the eastern to the western extremity of\r\nthe Philippines the distance is about nine degrees of longitude. Two\r\nislands, Luzon, with an area of two thousand, and Mindanao, with one of\r\nmore than one thousand five hundred square miles, are together larger\r\nthan all the rest. The seven next largest islands are Palawan, Samar,\r\nPanay, Mindoro, Leyte, Negros, and Cebu; of which the first measures\r\nabout two hundred and fifty, and the last about one hundred square\r\nmiles. Then come Bohol and Masbate, each about half the size of Cebu;\r\ntwenty smaller islands, still of some importance; and numerous tiny\r\nislets, rocks, and reefs.\r\n\r\n[Favored by position and conditions.] The Philippines are extremely\r\nfavored by their position and conditions. Their extension from\r\nnorth to south, over 16° of latitude, obtains for them a variety of\r\nclimate which the Dutch Indies, whose largest diameter, their extent\r\nin latitude north and south of the equator being but trifling, runs\r\nfrom the east to the west, by no means enjoy. The advantages accruing\r\nfrom their neighborhood to the equator are added to those acquired\r\nfrom the natural variety of their climate; and the produce of both the\r\ntorrid and temperate zones, the palm-tree and the fir, the pine-apple,\r\nthe corn ear and the potato, flourish side by side upon their shores.\r\n\r\n[Harbors and water highways.] The larger islands contain vast inland\r\nseas, considerable navigable rivers, and many creeks running far\r\ninto the interior; they are rich, too, in safe harbors and countless\r\nnatural ports of refuge for ships in distress. Another attribute\r\nwhich, though not to be realized by a glance at the map, is yet one\r\nof the most fortunate the Islands possess, is the countless number\r\nof small streams which pour down from the inland hills, and open out,\r\nere they reach the ocean, into broad estuaries; up these watercourses\r\ncoasting vessels of shallow draught can sail to the very foot of the\r\nmountains and take in their cargo. [Soil and sea alike productive.] The\r\nfertility of the soil is unsurpassed; both the sea around the coasts\r\nand the inland lakes swarm with fish and shell-fish, while in the whole\r\narchipelago there is scarcely a wild beast to be found. It seems that\r\nonly two civets happen to appear: Miro (paradoxurus philippinensis\r\nTem.) and galong (viverra tangalunga Gray). Luzon surpasses all the\r\nother islands, not only in size, but in importance; and its fertility\r\nand other natural superiority well entitle it to be called, as it is\r\nby Crawfurd, \"the most beautiful spot in the tropics.\"\r\n\r\n[Luzon.] The mainland of the isle of Luzon stretches itself in a\r\ncompact long quadrangle, twenty-five miles broad, from 18° 40' north\r\nlatitude to the Bay of Manila (14° 30'); and then projects, amid\r\nlarge lakes and deep creeks, a rugged promontory to the east, joined\r\nto the main continent by but two narrow isthmuses which stretch east\r\nand west of the large inland Lagoon of Bay. Many traces of recent\r\nupheavals betoken that the two portions were once separated and\r\nformed two distinct islands. The large eastern promontory, well-nigh\r\nas long as the northern portion, is nearly cut in half by two deep\r\nbays, which, starting from opposite points on the south-eastern\r\nand north-western coasts, almost merge their waters in the center\r\nof the peninsula; the Bay of Ragay, and the Bay of Sogod. In fact,\r\nthe southern portion of Luzon may be better described as two small\r\npeninsulas lying next to one another in parallel positions, and joined\r\ntogether by a narrow neck of land scarcely three miles broad. Two small\r\nstreams which rise nearly in the same spot and pour themselves into\r\nthe two opposite gulfs, make the separation almost complete, and form\r\nat the same time the boundary between the province of Tayabas on the\r\nwest, and that of Camarines on the east. The western portion, indeed,\r\nconsists almost entirely of the first-named district, and the eastern\r\nis divided into the provinces of North Camarines, South Camarines,\r\nand Albay. The first of these three is divided from Tayabas by the\r\nboundary already mentioned, and from South Camarines by a line drawn\r\nfrom the southern shore of the Bay of San Miguel on the north to the\r\nopposite coast. The eastern extremity of the peninsula forms the\r\nprovince of Albay; separated from South Camarines by a line which\r\nruns from Donzol, on the south coast, northwards across the volcano\r\nof Mayon, and which then, inclining to the west, reaches the northern\r\nshore. A look at the map will make these explanations clearer.\r\n\r\n[The monsoons.] There are two seasons in the Philippines, the wet and\r\nthe dry. The south-west monsoon brings the rainy season, at the time of\r\nour summer, to the provinces which lie exposed to the south and west\r\nwinds. On the northern and eastern coasts the heaviest downpours take\r\nplace (in our winter months) during the north-eastern monsoons. The\r\nruggedness of the country and its numerous mountains cause, in\r\ncertain districts, many variations in these normal meteorological\r\nconditions. The dry season lasts in Manila from November till June\r\n(duration of the north-east monsoon); rain prevails during the\r\nremaining months (duration of the south-west monsoon). The heaviest\r\nrainfall occurs in September; March and April are frequently free from\r\nrain. From October to February inclusively the weather is cool and dry\r\n(prevalence of N.W., N., and N.E. winds); March, April, and May are\r\nwarm and dry (prevalence of E.N.E., E., and E.S.E. winds); and from\r\nJune till the end of September it is humid and moderately warm.\r\n\r\nThere has been an observatory for many years past in Manila under\r\nthe management of the Jesuits. The following is an epitome of the\r\nyearly meteorological report for 1867, for which I am indebted to\r\nProfessor Dove:\r\n\r\nBarometrical readings.--The average height of the mercury was, in 1867,\r\n755.5; in 1865, 754.57; and in 1866, 753.37 millimeters.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the difference between the highest and lowest barometrical\r\nreadings was not more than 13.96 millimetres, and would have been\r\nmuch less if the mercury had not been much depressed by storms in July\r\nand September. The hourly variations amounted to very few millimeters.\r\n\r\nDaily reading of the barometer.--The mercury rises in the early morning\r\ntill about 9 a.m., it then falls up to 3 or 4 p.m., from then it rises\r\nagain till 9 p.m., and then again falls till towards day-break. Both\r\nthe principal atmospheric currents prevalent in Manila exercise\r\na great influence over the mercury in the barometer; the northern\r\ncurrent causes it to rise (to an average height of 756 millimeters),\r\nthe southern causes it to fall (to about 753 millimeters).\r\n\r\nTemperature.--The heat increases from January till the end of May,\r\nand then decreases till December. Average yearly temperature, 27.9°\r\nC. The highest temperature ever recorded (on the 15th of April at 3\r\np.m.) was 37.7° C.; the lowest (on the 14th of December and on the\r\n30th of January at 6 a.m.), 19.4° C. Difference, 18.3° C. [59]\r\n\r\nThermometrical variations.--The differences between the highest\r\nand lowest readings of the thermometer were, in January, 13.9°;\r\nin February, 14.2°; in March, 15°; in April, 14.6°; in May, 11.1°;\r\nin June, 9.9°; in July, 9°; in August, 9°; in September, 10°; in\r\nOctober, 11.9°; in November, 11.8°; and in December, 11.7°.\r\n\r\nCoolest months.--November, December and January, with northerly winds.\r\n\r\nHottest months.--April and May. Their high temperature is caused by\r\nthe change of monsoon from the north-east to the south-west. The\r\nstate of the temperature is most normal from June to September;\r\nthe variations are least marked during this period owing to the\r\nuninterrupted rainfall and the clouded atmosphere.\r\n\r\nDaily variations of the thermometer.--The coolest portion of the day\r\nis from 6 to 7 a.m.; the heat gradually increases, reaches its maximum\r\nabout 2 or 3 p.m., and then again gradually decreases. During some\r\nhours of the night the temperature remains unchanged, but towards\r\nmorning it falls rapidly.\r\n\r\n[Winds.] The direction of the wind is very regular at all seasons\r\nof the year, even when local causes make it vary a little. In the\r\ncourse of a twelvemonth the wind goes around the whole compass. In\r\nJanuary and February north winds prevail; in March and April they blow\r\nfrom the south-east; and in May, June, July, August, and September,\r\nfrom the south-west. In the beginning of October they vary between\r\nsouth-east and south-west, and settle down towards the close of the\r\nmonth in the north-east, in which quarter they remain tolerably fixed\r\nduring the two following months. The two changes of monsoon always\r\ntake place in April and May, and in October. As a rule, the direction\r\nof both monsoons preserves its equilibrium; but in Manila, which is\r\nprotected towards the north by a high range of hills, the north-east\r\nmonsoon is often diverted to the south-east and north-west. The same\r\ncause gives greater force to the south-west wind.\r\n\r\n[Sunshine and rain.] The sky is generally partially clouded; entirely\r\nsunny days are of rare occurrence, in fact, they only occur from\r\nJanuary to April during the north-east monsoons. Number of rainy days\r\nin the year, 168. The most continuous and heaviest rain falls from\r\nJune till the end of October. During this period the rain comes down\r\nin torrents; in September alone the rainfall amounted to 1.5 meters,\r\nnearly as much as falls in Berlin in the course of the whole year,\r\n3,072.8 millimeters of rain fell in the twelve month; but this is\r\nrather more than the average.\r\n\r\nThe evaporation only amounted to 2,307.3 millimeters; in ordinary\r\nyears it is generally about equal to the downfall, taking the early\r\naverages, not those of single months.\r\n\r\nThe average daily evaporation was about 6.3 millimeters.\r\n\r\n[Storms.] The changes of monsoons are often accompanied with tremendous\r\nstorms; during one of these, which occurred in September, the velocity\r\nof the wind was as much as thirty-seven or thirty-eight meters per\r\nsecond. An official report of the English vice-consul mentions a\r\ntyphoon which visited the Islands on September 27, 1865, and which\r\ndid much damage at Manila, driving seventeen vessels ashore.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n[Provinces and districts.] The Philippines are divided into provinces\r\n(P), and districts (D), each of which is administered by an alcalde of\r\nthe 1st (A1), 2nd (A2), or 3rd class (A3) (de termino, de ascenso, de\r\nentrada); by a political and military governor (G), or by a commandant\r\n(C). In some provinces an alcalde of the 3rd class is appointed as\r\ncoadjutor to the governor. These divisions are frequently changed.\r\n\r\n[Population.] The population is estimated approximately at about\r\nfive millions.\r\n\r\n[Language and dialects.] In spite of the long possessions of the\r\nIslands by the Spaniards their language has scarcely acquired any\r\nfooting there. A great diversity of languages and dialects prevails;\r\namongst them the Bisayan, Tagalog, Ilocano, Bicol, Pangasinan, and\r\nPampangan are the most important.\r\n\r\n[Luzon Provinces and their languages and populations.]\r\n\r\nIsland of Luzon\r\n\r\nRank of     Rank of     Name            Prevailing  Population  Pueblos\r\nOfficial    District                    Dialect\r\n\r\nG.

Although Sr. Barrantes had the best official materials at his\r\ndisposal, too much value must not be attributed to his figures,\r\nfor the sources from which he drew them are tainted with errors\r\nto an extent that can hardly be realized in Europe. For example,\r\nhe derives the following contradictory statements from his official\r\nsources:--The population of Cavite is set down as 115,300 and 65,225;\r\nthat of Mindoro as 45,630, and 23,054; that of Manila as 230,443,\r\nand 323,683; and that of Capiz as 788,947, and 191,818.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n[To Bulacan by steamer.]  My first excursion was to the province of\r\nBulacan, on the northern shore of the Bay of Manila. A couple of\r\nhours brought the steamer to the bar of Binuanga (not Bincanga as\r\nit is called in Coello's map), and a third to Bulacan, the capital\r\nof the province, situated on the flat banks of an influent of the\r\nPampanga delta. I was the only European passenger, the others were\r\ncomposed of Tagalogs, mestizos, and a few Chinese; the first more\r\nparticularly were represented by women, who are generally charged with\r\nthe management of all business affairs, for which they are much better\r\nfitted than the men. As a consequence, there are usually more women\r\nthan men seen in the streets, and it appears to be an admitted fact\r\nthat the female births are more numerous than the male. According,\r\nhowever, to the church-record which I looked through, the reverse was,\r\nat any rate in the eastern provinces, formerly the case.\r\n\r\n[Carromatas.]  At the landing-place a number of carromatas were waiting\r\nfor us,--brightly painted, shallow, two-wheeled boxes, provided with\r\nan awning, and harnessed to a couple of horses, in which strangers\r\nwith money to spend are quickly driven anywhere they may desire.\r\n\r\n[Town of Bulacan.]  The town of Bulacan contains from 11,000 to 12,000\r\ninhabitants; but a month before my arrival, the whole of it, with the\r\nexception of the church and a few stone houses, had been burnt to the\r\nground. All were therefore occupied in building themselves new houses,\r\nwhich, oddly enough, but very practically, were commenced at the roof,\r\nlike houses in a drawing. Long rows of roofs composed of palm-leaves\r\nand bamboos were laid in readiness on the ground, and in the meantime\r\nwere used as tents.\r\n\r\n[Frequence of fires.]  Similar destructive fires are very common. The\r\nhouses, which with few exceptions are built of bamboo and wood, become\r\nperfectly parched in the hot season, dried into so much touchwood by\r\nthe heat of the sun. Their inhabitants are extremely careless about\r\nfire, and there are no means whatever of extinguishing it. If anything\r\ncatches fire on a windy day, the entire village, as a rule, is utterly\r\ndone for. During my stay in Bulacan, the whole suburb of San Miguel,\r\nin the neighborhood of Manila, was burnt down, with the exception of\r\nthe house of a Swiss friend of mine, which owed its safety to the\r\nvigorous use of a private fire-engine, and the intermediation of a\r\nsmall garden full of bananas, whose stems full of sap stopped the\r\nprogress of the flames.\r\n\r\n[To Calumpit by carriage.]  I travelled to Calumpit, a distance of\r\nthree leagues, in the handsome carriage of an hospitable friend. The\r\nroads were good, and were continuously shaded by fruit-trees, coco and\r\nareca palms. The aspect of this fruitful province reminded me of the\r\nrichest districts of Java; but the pueblos here exhibited more comfort\r\nthan the desas there. The houses were more substantial; numerous roomy\r\nconstructions of wood, in many cases, even, of stone, denoted in every\r\nisland the residence of official and local magnates. But while even\r\nthe poorer Javanese always give their wicker huts a smart appearance,\r\nborder the roads of their villages with blooming hedges, and display\r\neverywhere a sense of neatness and cleanliness, there were here far\r\nfewer evidences of taste to be met with. I missed too the alun-alun,\r\nthat pretty and carefully tended open square, which, shaded by waringa\r\ntrees, is to be met with in every village in Java. And the quantity\r\nand variety of the fruit trees, under whose leaves the desas of Java\r\nare almost hidden, were by no means as great in this province, although\r\nit is the garden of the Philippines, as in its Dutch prototype.\r\n\r\n[Calumpit.]  I reached Calumpit towards evening, just as a procession,\r\nresplendent with flags and torches, and melodious with song, was\r\nmarching round the stately church, whose worthy priest, on the strength\r\nof a letter of introduction from Madrid, gave me a most hospitable\r\nreception. Calumpit, a prosperous place of 12,250 inhabitants, is\r\nsituated at the junction of the Quingua and Pampanga rivers, in an\r\nextremely fruitful plain, fertilized by the frequent overflowing of\r\nthe two streams.\r\n\r\n[Mt. Arayat.]  About six leagues to the north-west of Calumpit,\r\nMount Arayat, a lofty, isolated, conical hill, lifts its head. Seen\r\nfrom Calumpit, its western slope meets the horizon at an angle of 20°,\r\nits eastern at one of 25°; and the profile of its summit has a gentle\r\ninclination of from 4° to 5°.\r\n\r\n[Picking fish.]  At Calumpit I saw some Chinese catching fish in a\r\npeculiar fashion. Across the lower end of the bed of a brook which\r\nwas nearly dried up, and in which there were only a few rivulets\r\nleft running, they had fastened a hurdle of bamboo, and thrown up a\r\nshallow dam behind it. The water which collected was thrown over the\r\ndam with a long-handled winnowing shovel. The shovel was tied to a\r\nbamboo frame work ten feet high, the elasticity of which made the\r\nwork much easier. As soon as the pool was emptied, the fisherman\r\nwas easily able to pick out of the mud a quantity of small fish\r\n(Ophiocephalus vagus). These fishes, which are provided with peculiar\r\norganisms to facilitate respiration, at any rate, enabling them to\r\nremain for some considerable time on dry land, are in the wet season\r\nso numerous in the ditches, ponds, and rice-fields, that they can\r\nbe killed with a stick. When the water sinks they also retire, or,\r\naccording to Professor Semper, bore deeply into the ooze at the bottom\r\nof the watercourses, where, protected by a hard crust of earth from\r\nthe persecutions of mankind, they sleep away the winter. This Chinese\r\nmethod of fishing seems well adapted to the habits of the fish. The\r\ncircumstances that the dam is only constructed at the lower end of\r\nthe watercourse, and that it is there that the fish are to be met\r\nwith in the greatest numbers, seem to indicate that they can travel\r\nin the ooze, and that as the brooks and ditches get dried up, they\r\nseek the larger water channels.\r\n\r\n[To Baliwag.]  Following the Quingua in its upward and eastward\r\ncourse as it meandered through a well-cultivated and luxuriantly\r\nfertile country, past stone-built churches and chapels which grouped\r\nthemselves with the surrounding palm-trees and bamboo-bushes into\r\nsylvan vignettes, Father Llano's four-horsed carriage brought me to\r\nthe important town of Baliwag, the industry of which is celebrated\r\nbeyond the limits of the province.\r\n\r\n[Board houses and their furniture.]  I visited several families and\r\nreceived a friendly reception from all of them. The houses were built\r\nof boards and were placed upon piles elevated five feet above the\r\nground. Each consisted of a spacious dwelling apartment which opened on\r\none side into the kitchen, and on the other on to an open space, the\r\nazotea; a lofty roof of palm-trees spread itself above the dwelling,\r\nthe entrance to which was through the azotea. The latter was half\r\ncovered by the roof I have just mentioned. The floor was composed\r\nof slats an inch in width, laid half that distance apart. Chairs,\r\ntables, benches, a cupboard, a few small ornaments, a mirror, and some\r\nlithographs in frames, composed the furniture of the interior. The\r\ncleanliness of the house and the arrangement of its contents testified\r\nto the existence of order and prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Tapis weaving.]  I found the women in almost all the houses occupied\r\nin weaving tapis, which have a great reputation in the Manila\r\nmarket. They are narrow, thickly-woven silk scarves, six varas in\r\nlength, with oblique white stripes on a dark-brown ground. They are\r\nworn above the sarong.\r\n\r\n[Petaca cigar cases.]  Baliwag is also especially famous for its\r\npetaca [60]cigar-cases, which surpass all others in delicacy of\r\nworkmanship. They are not made of straw, but of fine strips of Spanish\r\ncane, and particularly from the lower ends of the leaf-stalks of the\r\ncalamusart, which is said to grow only in the province of Nueva Ecija.\r\n\r\n[Preparation of material.]  A bundle of a hundred selected stalks,\r\na couple of feet long, costs about six reals. When these stalks have\r\nbeen split lengthways into four or five pieces, the inner wood is\r\nremoved, till nothing but the outer part remains. The thin strips\r\nthus obtained are drawn by the hand between a convex block and a\r\nknife fixed in a sloping position, and between a couple of steel\r\nblades which nearly meet.\r\n\r\n[Costly weaving.]  It is a task requiring much patience and\r\npractice. In the first operation, as a rule, quite one-half of the\r\nstems are broken, and in the second more than half, so that scarcely\r\ntwenty per cent of the stalks survive the final process. In very fine\r\nmatting the proportionate loss is still greater. The plaiting is done\r\non wooden cylinders. A case of average workmanship, which costs two\r\ndollars on the spot, can be manufactured in six days' uninterrupted\r\nlabor. Cigar-cases of exceptionally intricate workmanship, made to\r\norder for a connoisseur, frequently cost upwards of fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n[Volcanic stone quarries.]  Following the Quingua from Baliwag up its\r\nstream, we passed several quarries, where we saw the thickly-packed\r\nstrata of volcanic stone which is used as a building material. The\r\nbanks of the river are thickly studded with prickly bamboos from\r\nten to twelve feet high. The water overflows in the rainy season,\r\nand floods the plain for a great distance. Hence the many shells of\r\nlarge freshwater mussels which are to be seen lying on the earth which\r\ncovers the volcanic deposit. The country begins to get hilly in the\r\nneighborhood of Tobog, a small place with no church of its own, and\r\ndependent for its services upon the priest of the next parish. The\r\ngentle slopes of the hills are, as in Java, cut into terraces and\r\nused for the cultivation of rice. Except at Lucban I have never\r\nobserved similar sawas anywhere else in the Philippines. Several small\r\nsugar-fields, which, however, the people do not as yet understand\r\nhow to manage properly, show that the rudiments of agricultural\r\nprosperity are already in existence. The roads are partly covered\r\nwith awnings, beneath which benches are placed affording repose to\r\nthe weary traveller. I never saw these out of this province. One\r\nmight fancy oneself in one of the most fertile and thickly-populated\r\ndistricts of Java.\r\n\r\n[A convento and the parish priest.] I passed the night in a convento,\r\nas the dwelling of the parish priest is called in the Philippines. It\r\nwas extremely dirty, and the priest, an Augustinian, was full of\r\nproselytish ardor. I had to undergo a long geographical examination\r\nabout the difference between Prussia and Russia; was asked whether\r\nthe great city of Nuremberg was the capital of the grand-duchy or of\r\nthe empire of Russia; learnt that the English were on the point of\r\nreturning to the bosom of the Catholic Church, and that the \"others\"\r\nwould soon follow, and was, in short, in spite of the particular\r\nrecommendation of Father Llanos, very badly received. Some little time\r\nafterwards I fell into the hands of two young Capuchins, who tried to\r\nconvert me, but who, with the exception of this little impertinence,\r\ntreated me capitally. They gave me pâtés de foie gras boiled in water,\r\nwhich I quickly recognized by the truffles swimming about in the\r\ngrease. To punish them for their importunity I refrained from telling\r\nmy hosts the right way to cook the pâtés, which I had the pleasure of\r\nafterwards eating in the forest, as I easily persuaded them to sell\r\nme the tins they had left. These are the only two occasions on which\r\nI was subjected to this kind of annoyance during my eighteen months'\r\nresidence in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[Arrangements for travellers.] The traveller who is provided\r\nwith a passport is, however, by no means obliged to rely upon\r\npriestly hospitality, as he needs must do in many isolated parts of\r\nEurope. Every village, every hamlet, has its commonhouse, called casa\r\nreal or tribunal, in which he can take up his quarters and be supplied\r\nwith provisions at the market price, a circumstance that I was not\r\nacquainted with on the occasion of my first trip. The traveller is\r\ntherefore in this respect perfectly independent, at least in theory,\r\nthough in practice he will often scarcely be able to avoid putting\r\nup at the conventos in the more isolated parts of the country. In\r\nthese the priest, perhaps the only white man for miles around, is\r\nwith difficulty persuaded to miss the opportunity of housing such\r\na rare guest, to whom he is only too anxious to give up the best\r\nbedroom in his dwelling, and to offer everything that his kitchen\r\nand cellar can afford. Everything is placed before the guest in such\r\na spirit of sincere and undisguised friendliness, that he feels no\r\nobligation, but on the contrary easily persuades himself that he is\r\ndoing his host a favor by prolonging his stay. Upon one occasion,\r\nwhen I had determined, in spite of an invitation from the padre,\r\nto occupy the casa real, just as I was beginning to instal myself,\r\nthe priest appeared upon the scene with the municipal officials and a\r\nband of music which was in the neighborhood pending the preparations\r\nfor a religious festival. He made them lift me up, chair and all,\r\nand with music and general rejoicing carried me off to his own house.\r\n\r\n[Kupang iron-foundry.] On the following day I paid a visit to Kupang,\r\nan iron-foundry lying to the N.N.E of Angat, escorted by two armed\r\nmen, whose services I was pressed to accept, as the district had a bad\r\nreputation for robberies. After travelling three or four miles in a\r\nnortherly direction, we crossed the Banauon, at that time a mere brook\r\nmeandering through shingle, but in the rainy season an impetuous stream\r\nmore than a hundred feet broad; and in a couple of hours we reached the\r\niron-works, an immense shed lying in the middle of the forest, with\r\na couple of wings at each end, in which the manager, an Englishman,\r\nwho had been wrecked some years before in Samar, lived with his wife,\r\na pretty mestiza. If I laid down my handkerchief, my pencil, or any\r\nother object, the wife immediately locked them up to protect them from\r\nthe kleptomania of her servants. These poor people, whose enterprise\r\nwas not a very successful one, had to lead a wretched life. Two years\r\nbefore my visit a band of twenty-seven robbers burst into the place,\r\nsacked the house, and threw its mistress, who was alone with her\r\nmaid at the time, out of the window. She fortunately alighted without\r\nreceiving any serious hurt, but the maid, whom terror caused to jump\r\nout of the window also, died of the injuries she received. The robbers,\r\nwho turned out to be miners and residents in Angat, were easily caught,\r\nand, when I was there, had already spent a couple of years in prison\r\nawaiting their trial.\r\n\r\n[A negrito family.] I met a negrito family here who had friendly\r\nrelations with the people in the iron-works, and were in the habit\r\nof exchanging the produce of the forest with them for provisions. The\r\nfather of this family accompanied me on a hunting expedition. He was\r\narmed with a bow and a couple of arrows. The arrows had spear-shaped\r\niron points a couple of inches long; one of them had been dipped\r\ninto arrow-poison, a mixture that looked like black tar. The women\r\nhad guitars (tabaua) similar to those used by the Mintras in the\r\nMalay peninsula. They were made of pieces of bamboo a foot long,\r\nto which strings of split chair-cane were fastened. [61]\r\n\r\n[Unwelcome hospitality.] Upon my return, to avoid spending the night\r\nat the wretched convento where I had left my servant with my luggage,\r\nI took the advice of my friends at the iron-works and started late,\r\nin order to arrive at the priest's after ten o'clock at night; for\r\nI knew that the padre shut up his house at ten, and that I could\r\ntherefore sleep, without offending him, beneath the roof of a wealthy\r\nmestizo, an acquaintance of theirs. About half-past ten I reached\r\nthe latter's house, and sat down to table with the merry women of\r\nthe family, who were just having their supper. Suddenly my friend the\r\nparson made his appearance from an inner room, where with a couple of\r\nAugustinian friars, he had been playing cards with the master of the\r\nhouse. He immediately began to compliment me upon my good fortune,\r\n\"for had you been but one minute later,\" said he, \"you certainly\r\nwouldn't have got into the convento.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Lagoon of Bay.] My second trip took me up the Pasig to the great\r\nLagoon of Bay. I left Manila at night in a banca, a boat hollowed out\r\nof a tree-trunk, with a vaulted roof made of bamboo and so low that it\r\nwas almost impossible to sit upright under it, which posture, indeed,\r\nthe banca-builder appeared to have neglected to consider. A bamboo\r\nhurdle placed at the bottom of the boat protects the traveller from\r\nthe water and serves him as a couch. Jurien de la Gravière [62]\r\ncompares the banca to a cigar-box, in which the traveller is so\r\ntightly packed that he would have little chance of saving his life\r\nif it happened to upset. The crew was composed of four rowers and\r\na helmsman; their daily pay was five reals apiece, in all nearly\r\nseven pesos, high wages for such lazy fellows in comparison with\r\nthe price of provisions, for the rice that a hard-working man ate in\r\na day seldom cost more than seven centavos (in the provinces often\r\nscarcely six), and the rest of his food (fish and vegetables), only\r\none centavo. We passed several villages and tiendas on the banks in\r\nwhich food was exposed for sale. My crew, after trying to interrupt\r\nthe journey under all sorts of pretences, left the boat as we came to\r\na village, saying that they were going to fetch some sails; but they\r\nforgot to return. At last, with the assistance of the night watchman\r\nI succeeded in hauling them out of some of their friends' houses,\r\nwhere they had concealed themselves. After running aground several\r\ntimes upon the sandbanks, we entered the land and hill-locked Lagoon\r\nof Bay, and reached Jalajala early in the morning.\r\n\r\n[The Pasig.] The Pasig forms a natural canal, about six leagues long,\r\nbetween the Bay of Manila and the Lagoon of Bay, a fresh water lake,\r\nthirty-five leagues in circumference, that washes the shores of three\r\nfertile provinces, Manila, Laguna and Cavite. Formerly large vessels\r\nfull of cargo used to be able to sail right up to the borders of the\r\nlake; now they are prevented by sandbanks. Even flat-bottomed boats\r\nfrequently run aground on the Napindan and Taguig banks. [63] Were\r\nthe banks removed, and the stone bridge joining Manila to Binondo\r\nreplaced by a swing bridge, or a canal made round it, the coasting\r\nvessels would be able to ship the produce of the lagoon provinces\r\nat the very foot of the fields in which they grow. The traffic would\r\nbe very profitable, the waters would shrink, and the shallows along\r\nthe shore might be turned into rice and sugar fields. A scheme of\r\nthis kind was approved more than thirty years ago in Madrid, but it\r\nwas never carried into execution. The sanding up of the river has,\r\non the contrary, been increased by a quantity of fish reels, the\r\nerection of which has been favored by the Colonial Waterways Board\r\nbecause it reaped a small tax from them.\r\n\r\n[A famous plantation.] Jalajala, an estate which occupies the eastern\r\nof the two peninsulas which run southward into the lake, is one of\r\nthe first places visited by strangers. It owes this preference to\r\nits beautiful position and nearness to Manila, and to the fantastic\r\ndescription of it by a former owner, De la Gironnière. The soil\r\nof the peninsula is volcanic; its range of hills is very rugged,\r\nand the watercourses bring down annually a quantity of soil from the\r\nmountains, which increases the deposits at their base. The shore-line,\r\novergrown with grass and prickly sensitive-plants quite eight feet\r\nhigh, makes capital pasture for carabaos. Behind it broad fields of\r\nrice and sugar extend themselves up to the base of the hills. Towards\r\nthe north the estate is bounded by the thickly-wooded Sembrano,\r\nthe highest mountain in the peninsula; on the remaining sides it\r\nis surrounded with water. With the exception of the flat shore, the\r\nwhole place is hilly and overgrown with grass and clumps of trees,\r\ncapital pasture for its numerous herds--a thousand carabaos, one\r\nthousand five hundred to two thousand bullocks, and from six to seven\r\nhundred nearly wild horses. As we were descending one of the hills,\r\nwe were suddenly surrounded by half-a-dozen armed men, who took us\r\nfor cattle-thieves, but who, to their disappointment, were obliged\r\nto forego their expected chance of a reward.\r\n\r\n[Los Baños hot springs.] Beyond Jalajala, on the south coast of\r\nthe Lagoon of Bay, lies the hamlet of Los Baños, so called from a\r\nhot spring at the foot of the Makiling volcano. Even prior to the\r\narrival of the Spaniards, the natives used its waters as a remedy,\r\n[64] but they are now very little patronized. The shore of the lake is\r\nat this point, and indeed all round its circumference, so flat that it\r\nis impossible to land with dry feet from the shallowest canoe. It is\r\nquite covered with sand mussels. North-west of Los Baños there lies\r\na small volcanic lake fringed with thick woods, called Dagatan (the\r\nenchanted lagoon of travellers), to distinguish it from Dagât, as the\r\nTagals call the great Lagoon of Bay. I saw nothing of the crocodiles\r\nwhich are supposed to infest it, but we flushed several flocks of wild\r\nfowl, disturbed by our invasion of their solitude. From Los Baños I had\r\nintended to go to Lupang Puti (white earth), where, judging from the\r\nsamples shown me, there is a deposit of fine white silicious earth,\r\nwhich is purified in Manila and used as paint. I did not reach the\r\nplace, as the guide whom I had with difficulty obtained, pretended,\r\nafter a couple of miles, to be dead beat. From the inquiries I made,\r\nhowever, I apprehend that it is a kind of solfatara. Several deposits\r\nof it appear to exist at the foot of the Makiling. [65]\r\n\r\n[Talim island.] On my return I paid a visit to the Island of\r\nTalim, which, with the exception of a clearing occupied by a few\r\nmiserable huts, is uninhabited and thickly overgrown with forest and\r\nundergrowth. In the center of the Island is the Susong-Dalaga (maiden's\r\nbosom), a dolerite hill with a beautifully formed crest. Upon the\r\nshore, on a bare rock, I found four eggs containing fully developed\r\nyoung crocodiles. When I broke the shells the little reptiles made off.\r\n\r\n[M. de la Gironnière.] Although the south-west monsoons generally occur\r\nlater in Jalajala than in Manila, it was already raining so hard that\r\nI decided to go to Calauan, on the southern shore of the lake, which\r\nis protected by Mount Makiling, and does not experience the effect of\r\nthe rainy monsoons till later in the season. I met M. de la Gironnière\r\nin Calauan, the \"gentilhomme Breton\" who is so well known for telling\r\nthe most terrible adventures. He had lately returned from Europe to\r\nestablish a large sugar manufactory. His enterprise, however, was a\r\nfailure. The house of the lively old gentleman, whose eccentricity\r\nhad led him to adopt the dress and the frugal habits of the natives,\r\nwas neither clean or well kept, although he had a couple of friends\r\nto assist him in the business, a Scotchman, and a young Frenchman\r\nwho had lived in the most refined Parisian society.\r\n\r\n[Llanura de Imuc.] There were several small lakes and a few empty\r\nvolcanic basins on the estate. To the south-west, not very far\r\nfrom the house, and to the left of the road leading to San Pablo,\r\nlies the Llanura de Imuc, a valley of dolerite more than a hundred\r\nfeet deep. Large blocks of basalt enable one to climb down into the\r\nvalley, the bottom of which is covered with dense growths. The center\r\nof the basin is occupied by a neglected coffee plantation laid out\r\nby a former proprietor. The density of the vegetation prevented my\r\ntaking more precise observations. There is another shallower volcanic\r\ncrater to the north of it. Its soil was marshy and covered with cane\r\nand grass, but even in the rainy season it does not collect sufficient\r\nwater to turn it into a lake. It might, therefore, be easily drained\r\nand cultivated. To the south-west of this basin, and to the right\r\nof the road to San Pablo, lies the [Tigui-mere.] Tigui-mere. From a\r\nplain of whitish-grey soil, covered with concentric shells as large\r\nas a nut, rises a circular embankment with gently-sloping sides,\r\nintersected only by a small cleft which serves as an entrance, and\r\nwhich shows, on its edges denuded of vegetation, the loose rapilli of\r\nwhich the embankment is formed. The sides of this natural amphitheatre\r\ntower more than a hundred feet above its flat base. A path runs east\r\nand west right through the center. The northern half is studded with\r\ncocopalm trees and cultivated plants; the southern portion is full of\r\nwater nearly covered with green weeds and slime. The ground consists\r\nof black rapilli.\r\n\r\n[Leaf imprints in lava.]  From the Tigui-mere I returned to the\r\nhacienda a bank formed of volcanic lava two feet in thickness\r\nand covered with indistinct impressions of leaves. Their state of\r\npreservation did not allow me to distinguish their species, but they\r\ncertainly belonged to some tropical genus, and are, according to\r\nProfessor A. Braun, of the same kind as those now growing there.\r\n\r\nThere are two more small lakes half a league to the south-east. The\r\nroad leading to them is composed of volcanic remains which cover the\r\nsoil, and large blocks of lava lie in the bed of the stream.\r\n\r\n[Maycap Lake.]  The first of the two, the Maycap Lake, is entirely\r\nembanked with the exception of a small opening fitted with sluices\r\nto supply water to a canal; and from its northern side, which alone\r\nadmits of an open view, the southern peak of San Cristobal may\r\nbe seen, about 73° to the north-east. Its banks, which are about\r\neighty feet high, rise with a gentle slope in a westerly direction,\r\ntill they join Mount Maiba, a hill about 500 feet high. The soil,\r\nlike that of the embankments of the other volcanic lakes, consists\r\nof rapilli and lava, and is thickly wooded.\r\n\r\n[Lake Palakpakan.]  Close by is another lake, Palakpakan, of nearly\r\nthe same circumference, and formed in a similar manner (of black\r\nsand and rapilli). Its banks are from thirty to one hundred feet\r\nhigh. From its north-western edge San Cristobal lifts its head 70° to\r\nthe northeast. Its waters are easily reached, and are much frequented\r\nby fishermen.\r\n\r\n[Palm brandy.]  About nine o'clock, a.m., I rode from Calauan to Pila,\r\nand thence in a northeasterly direction to Santa Cruz, over even,\r\nbroad, and well-kept roads, through a palm-grove a mile long and a\r\nmile and a half broad, which extends down to the very edge of the\r\nlagoons. The products of these palm trees generally are not used\r\nfor the production of oil but for the manufacture of brandy. Their\r\nfruit is not allowed to come to maturity; but the buds are slit open,\r\nand the sweet sap is collected  as it drips from them. It is then\r\nallowed to ferment, and subjected to distillation. [66] As the sap\r\nis collected twice a day, and as the blossoms, situated at the top\r\nof the tree, are forty or fifty feet above the ground, bamboos are\r\nfastened horizontally, one above the other, from one tree to another,\r\nto facilitate the necessary ascent and descent. The sap collector\r\nstands on the lower cross-piece while he holds on to the upper.\r\n\r\n[Bought by government.] The sale of palm-brandy was at the time of my\r\nvisit the monopoly of the government, which retailed it in the Estanco\r\n(government sale rooms) with cigars, stamped paper, and religious\r\nindulgences. The manufacture was carried on by private individuals;\r\nbut the whole of the brandy was of necessity disposed of to the\r\nadministration, which, however, paid such a high price for it that\r\nthe contractors made large profits.\r\n\r\n[Profit in manufacture.] I afterwards met a Spaniard in Camarines who,\r\naccording to his own account, must have made considerable and easy\r\ngains from these contracts. He had bought palm-trees at an average\r\nprice of five reals apiece (they usually cost more, though they can\r\nbe sometimes purchased for two reals). Thirty-five palms will furnish\r\ndaily at least thirty-six quarts of tuba (sugar-containing sap), from\r\nwhich, after fermentation and distillation, six quarts of brandy of\r\nthe prescribed strength can be manufactured. One man is sufficient to\r\nattend to them, and receives for his trouble half the proceeds. The\r\nadministration pays six cuartos for a quart of brandy. My friend the\r\ncontractor was in annual receipt, therefore, from every thirty-five\r\nof his trees, of 360 × 1/2 × 5 cuartos = $40.50. As the thirty-five\r\ntrees only cost him $21.875, his invested capital brought him in\r\nabout 200 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Wine and liquor monopoly a failure.]  The proceeds of this monopoly\r\n(wines and liquors) were rated at $1,622,810 in the colonial budget for\r\n1861; but its collection was so difficult, and so disproportionately\r\nexpensive, that it nearly swallowed up the whole profit. It caused\r\nespionage, robberies of all sorts, embezzlement, and bribery on a\r\nlarge scale. The retail of the brandy by officials, who are paid by a\r\npercentage on the consumption, did a good deal to injure the popular\r\nrespect for the government. Moreover, the imposition of this improper\r\ntax on the most important industry of the country not only crippled\r\nthe free trade in palms, but also the manufacture of raw sugar;\r\nfor the government, to favor their own monopoly, had forbidden the\r\nsugar manufacturers to make rum from their molasses, which became\r\nin consequence so valueless that in Manila they gave it to their\r\nhorses. The complaints of the manufacturers at last stirred up the\r\nadministration to allow the manufacture of rum; but the palm-brandy\r\nmonopoly remained intact. The Filipinos now drank nothing but rum,\r\nso that at last, in self-defence, the government entirely abandoned\r\nthe monopoly (January, 1864). Since that, the rum manufacturers pay\r\ntaxes according to the amount of their sale, but not upon the amount\r\nof their raw produce. In order to cover the deficit occasioned by\r\nthe abandonment of the brandy monopoly, the government has made a\r\nsmall increase in the poll-tax. The practice of drinking brandy has\r\nnaturally much increased; it is, however, a very old habit. [67] With\r\nthis exception, the measure has had the most favorable consequences.\r\n\r\n[Santa Cruz.]  Santa Cruz is a lively, prosperous place (in 1865 it\r\ncontained 11,385 inhabitants), through the center of which runs a\r\nriver. As the day on which we passed through it was Sunday, the stream\r\nwas full of bathers, amongst them several women, their luxuriant hair\r\ncovered with broad-brimmed hats to shade them from the sun. From the\r\nford the road takes a sharp turn and inclines first to the east and\r\nthen to the south-east, till it reaches Magdalena, between which and\r\nMajaijai the country becomes hilly. Just outside the latter, a viaduct\r\ntakes the road across a deep ravine full of magnificent ferns, which\r\nremind the traveller of the height--more than 600 feet--above the sea\r\nlevel to which he has attained. The spacious convento at Majaijai,\r\nbuilt by the Jesuits, is celebrated for its splendid situation. The\r\nLagoon of Bay is seen to extend far to the north-east; in the distance\r\nthe Peninsula of Jalajala and the Island of Talim, from which rises\r\nthe Susong-Dalaga volcano, terminate the vista. From the convento to\r\nthe lake stretches an endless grove of coco-trees, while towards the\r\nsouth the slope of the distant high ground grows suddenly steeper,\r\nand forms an abruptly precipitous conical hill, intersected by deep\r\nravines. This is the Banajao or Majaijai volcano, and beside it Mount\r\nSan Cristobal rears its bell-shaped summit.\r\n\r\n[Scenery along Lucban-Maubon road.] As everybody was occupied with\r\nthe preparations for an ensuing religious festival, I betook myself,\r\nthrough Lucban on the eastern shore, to Mauban, situated amidst\r\ndeep ravines and masses of lava at the foot of Mount Majaijai. The\r\nvegetation was of indescribable beauty, and the miserable road\r\nwas enlivened with cheerful knots of pedestrians hastening to the\r\nfestival. [68]\r\n\r\n[Lucban.] I reached Lucban in three hours; it is a prosperous place\r\nof 13,000 inhabitants, to the north-east of Majaijai. A year after my\r\nvisit it burnt to the ground. The agricultural produce of the district\r\nis not very important, owing to the mountainous nature of the country;\r\nbut considerable industrial activity prevails there. The inhabitants\r\nweave fine straw hats from the fibre of the leaf of the buri palm-tree\r\n(corypha sp.), manufacture pandanus mats, and carry on a profitable\r\ntrade at Mauban with the placer miners of North Camarines. The entire\r\nbreadth of the road is covered with cement, and along its center flows,\r\nin an open channel, a sparkling rivulet.\r\n\r\n[Java-like rice fields.] The road from Lucban to Mauban, which is\r\nsituated on the bay of Lamon, opposite to the Island of Alabat, winds\r\nalong the narrow watercourse of the Mapon river, through deep ravines\r\nwith perpendicular cliffs of clay. I observed several terrace-formed\r\nrice-fields similar to those so prevalent in Java, an infrequent\r\nsight in the Philippines. Presently the path led us into the very\r\nthick of the forest. Nearly all the trees were covered with aroides\r\nand creeping ferns; amongst them I noticed the angiopteris, pandanus,\r\nand several large specimens of the fan palm.\r\n\r\n[Mapon river.]  Three leagues from Lucban the river flows under a rock\r\nsupported on prismatically shaped pillars, and then runs through a\r\nbed of round pebbles, composed of volcanic stone and white lime, as\r\nhard as marble, in which impressions of shell-fish and coral can be\r\ntraced. Further up the river the volcanic rubble disappears, and the\r\ncontaining strata then consist of the marble-like pebbles cemented\r\ntogether with calcareous spar. These strata alternate with banks of\r\nclay and coarse-grained soil, which contain scanty and badly preserved\r\nimprints of leaves and mussel-fish. Amongst them, however, I observed\r\na flattened but still recognizable specimen of the fossil melania. The\r\nriver-bed must be quite five hundred feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Bamboo raft ferry.] About a league beyond Mauban, as it was getting\r\ndusk, we crossed the river, then tolerably broad, on a wretched leaking\r\nbamboo raft, which sank at least six inches beneath the water under\r\nthe weight of our horses, and ran helplessly aground in the mud on\r\nthe opposite side.\r\n\r\n[Visitors to festival.] The tribunal or common-house was crowded with\r\npeople who had come to attend the festival which was to take place\r\non the following day. The cabezas wore, in token of their dignity,\r\na short jacket above their shirts. A quantity of brightly decorated\r\ntables laden with fruit and pastry stood against the walls, and in\r\nthe middle of the principal room a dining-table was laid out for\r\nforty persons.\r\n\r\n[Hospitality of tribunal.] A European who travels without a\r\nservant--mine had run away with some wages I had rashly paid\r\nhim in advance--is put down as a beggar, and I was overwhelmed\r\nwith impertinent questions on the subject, which, however, I left\r\nunanswered. As I hadn't had the supper I stood considerably in need of,\r\nI took the liberty of taking a few savory morsels from the meatpot,\r\nwhich I ate in the midst of a little knot of wondering spectators;\r\nI then laid myself down to sleep on the bench beside the table, to\r\nwhich a second set of diners were already sitting down. When I awoke\r\non the following morning there were already so many people stirring\r\nthat I had no opportunity of performing my toilet. I therefore betook\r\nmyself in my dirty travelling dress to the residence of a Spaniard who\r\nhad settled in the pueblo, and who received me in the most hospitable\r\nmanner as soon as the description in my passport satisfied him that\r\nI was worthy of a confidence not inspired by my appearance.\r\n\r\n[Trade in molaze.] My friendly host carried on no trifling\r\nbusiness. Two English ships were at that moment in the harbor, which\r\nhe was about to send to China laden with molave, a species of wood\r\nakin to teak.\r\n\r\n[Butucan waterfall.] On my return I visited the fine waterfall of\r\nButucan, between Mauban and Lucban, a little apart from the high\r\nroad. A powerful stream flows between two high banks of rocky\r\nsoil thickly covered with vegetation, and, leaping from a ledge\r\nof volcanic rock suddenly plunges into a ravine, said to be three\r\nhundred and sixty feet in depth, along the bottom of which it is\r\nhurried away. The channel, however, is so narrow, and the vegetation\r\nso dense, that an observer looking at it from above can not follow\r\nits course. This waterfall has a great similarity to that which falls\r\nfrom the Semeru in Java. Here, as there, a volcanic stream flowing over\r\nvast rocky deposits forms a horizontal watercourse, which in its turn\r\nis overshadowed with immense masses of rock. The water easily forces\r\nits way between these till it reaches the solid lava, when it leaves\r\nits high, narrow, and thickly-wooded banks, and plunges into the deep\r\nchasm it has itself worn away. The pouring rain unfortunately prevented\r\nme from sketching this fine fall. It was raining when I reached the\r\nconvento of Majaijai, and it was still raining when I left it three\r\ndays later, nor was there any hope of improvement in the weather for\r\nanother month to come. \"The wet season lasts for eight or nine months\r\nin Majaijai, and during the whole period scarcely a day passes without\r\nthe rain falling in torrents.\"--Estado geograph.\r\n\r\n[Majaijai.] To ascend the volcano was under such circumstances\r\nimpracticable. According to some notes written by the Majaijai\r\npriest, an ascent and survey of Mount Banajao was made on the 22nd\r\nof April, 1858, by Senors Roldan and Montero, two able Spanish naval\r\nofficers, specially charged with the revision of the marine chart\r\nof the archipelago. From its summit they took observations of Manila\r\ncathedral, of Mayon, another volcano in Albay, and of the Island of\r\nPolillo. They estimated the altitude of Banajao to be seven thousand\r\nand twenty Spanish feet, and the depth of its crater to be seven\r\nhundred. The crater formerly contained a lake, but the last eruption\r\nmade a chasm in its southern side through which the water flowed\r\naway. [69]\r\n\r\n[Calauan.] I reached Calauan in the pouring rain, wading through the\r\nsoft spongy clay upon wretched, half-starved ponies, and found I must\r\nput off my water journey to Manila till the following day, as there\r\nwas no boat on the lake at this point. The next morning there were no\r\nhorses to be found; and it was not till the afternoon that I procured\r\na cart and a couple of carabaos to take me to Santa Cruz, whence in the\r\nevening the market-vessel started for Manila. One carabao was harnessed\r\nin front; the other was fastened behind the cart in order that I might\r\nhave a change of animals when the first became tired. Carabao number\r\none wouldn't draw, and number two acted as a drag--rather useless\r\napparatus on a level road--so I changed them. As soon as number two\r\nfelt the load it laid down. A few blows persuaded it to pick itself up,\r\nwhen it deliberately walked to the nearest pool and dropped into it. It\r\nwas with the greatest trouble that we unharnessed the cart and pushed\r\nit back on to the road, while our two considerate beasts took a mud\r\nbath. At last we reloaded the baggage, the carabaos were reharnessed in\r\nthe original positions, and the driver, leaning his whole weight upon\r\nthe nose-rope of the leading beast, pulled with might and main. To my\r\ngreat delight the animal condescended to slowly advance with the cart\r\nand its contents. [Pila.] At Pila I managed to get a better team, with\r\nwhich late in the evening, in the midst of a pouring rain, I reached\r\na little hamlet opposite Santa Cruz. The market-vessel had left; our\r\nattempts to get a boat to take us across to the village only led to\r\nbarefaced attempts at extortion, so I entered one of the largest of the\r\nhamlet's houses, which was occupied by a widow and her daughter. After\r\nsome delay my request for a night's lodging was granted. I sent for\r\nsome oil, to give me a little light, and something to eat. The women\r\nbrought in some of their relations, who helped to prepare the food\r\nand stopped in the house to protect its owners. The next morning\r\nI crossed the river, teeming with joyous bathers, to Santa Cruz,\r\nand hired a boat there to take me across the lake to Pasig, and from\r\nthence to Manila. A contrary wind, however, forced us to land on the\r\npromontory of Jalajala, and there wait for the calm that accompanies\r\nthe dawn. [Earthquake evidences.] Betwixt the extreme southern point\r\nof the land and the houses I saw, in several places, banks of mussels\r\nprojecting at least fifteen feet above the surface of the water,\r\nsimilar to those which are so frequently found on the sea-coast;--a\r\nproof that earthquakes have taken place in this neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n[To Albay by schooner.] Towards the end of August I started from\r\nManila for Albay in a schooner which had brought a cargo of hemp and\r\nwas returning in ballast. It was fine when we set sail; but on the\r\nfollowing day the signs of a coming storm increased so rapidly that\r\nthe captain resolved to return and seek protection in the small but\r\nsecure harbor of Mariveles, a creek on the southern shore of Bataan,\r\nthe province forming the western boundary of Manila bay. We reached\r\nit about two o'clock in the night after cruising about for fourteen\r\nhours before the entrance; and we were obliged to remain here at anchor\r\nfor a fortnight, as it rained and stormed continuously for that period.\r\n\r\n[Mariveles.] The weather obliged me to limit my excursions to the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of Mariveles. Unfortunately it was not till the\r\nclose of our stay that I learnt that there was a colony of negritos in\r\nthe mountains; and it was not till just before my departure that I got\r\na chance of seeing and sketching a couple of them, male and female. The\r\ninhabitants of Mariveles have not a very good reputation. The place\r\nis only visited by ships which run in there in bad weather, when\r\ntheir idle crews spend the time in drinking and gambling. Some of\r\nthe young girls were of striking beauty and of quite a light color;\r\noften being in reality of mixed race, though they passed as of pure\r\nTagal blood. This is a circumstance I have observed in many seaports,\r\nand in the neighborhood of Manila; but, in the districts which are\r\nalmost entirely unvisited by the Spaniards, the natives are much\r\ndarker and of purer race.\r\n\r\n[Storm-bound shipping.] The number of ships which were seeking\r\nprotection from the weather in this port amounted to ten, of which\r\nthree were schooners. Every morning regularly a small pontin [70]\r\nused to attempt to set sail; but it scarcely got a look at the\r\nopen sea before it returned, when it was saluted with the jeers and\r\nlaughter of the others. It was hunger that made them so bold. The\r\ncrew, who had taken some of their own produce to Manila, had spent\r\nthe proceeds of their venture, and had started on their return voyage\r\nscantily provided with provisions, with the hope and intention of soon\r\nreaching their home, which they could have done with any favorable\r\nwind. Such cases frequently occur. A few natives unite to charter\r\na small vessel, and load it with the produce of their own fields,\r\nwhich they set off to sell in Manila.\r\n\r\n[The straits.] The straits between the Islands resemble beautiful\r\nwide rivers with charming spots upon the banks inhabited by small\r\ncolonies; and the sailors generally find the weather gets squally\r\ntowards evening, and anchor till the morning breaks.\r\n\r\n[Filipino hospitality.] The hospitable coast supplies them with fish,\r\ncrabs, plenty of mussels, and frequently unprotected coconuts. If it\r\nis inhabited, so much the better. Filipino hospitality is ample, and\r\nmuch more comprehensive than that practised in Europe. The crews are\r\naccommodated in the different huts. After a repast shared in common,\r\nand washed down by copious draughts of palm-wine, mats are streched\r\non the floor; the lamps--large shells, fitted with rush wicks--are\r\nextinguished, and the occupants of the hut fall asleep together. Once,\r\nas I was sailing into the bay of Manila after a five day's cruise, we\r\novertook a craft which had sailed from the same port as we had with a\r\ncargo of coconut oil for Manila, and which had spent six months upon\r\nits trip. It is by no means uncommon for a crew which makes a long\r\nstay in the capital to squander the whole proceeds of their cargo,\r\nif they have not done it before reaching town.\r\n\r\n[Coasting Luzon.] At last one evening, when the storm had quite passed\r\naway, we sailed out of Mariveles. A small, volcanic, pillar-shaped\r\nrock, bearing a striking resemblance to the Island of the Cyclops,\r\noff the coast of Sicily, lies in front of the harbor--like there, a\r\nsharp pyramid and a small, flat island. We sailed along the coast of\r\nCavite till we reached Point Santiago, the southwestern extremity of\r\nLuzon, and then turned to the east, through the fine straits that lie\r\nbetween Luzon to the north and the Bisayan islands to the south. As\r\nthe sun rose, a beautiful spectacle presented itself. To the north\r\nwas the peak of the Taal volcano, towering above the flat plains of\r\nBatangas; and to the south the thickly-wooded, but rock-bound coast\r\nof Mindoro, the iron line of which was broken by the harbor of Porto\r\nGalera, protected from the fury of the waves by a small islet lying\r\nimmediately before it. The waters around us were thickly studded with\r\nvessels which had taken refuge from the storm in the Bisayan ports,\r\nand were now returning to Manila.\r\n\r\n[Importance of straits.] These straits, which extend from the\r\nsouth-east to the northwest, are the great commercial highway of\r\nthe Archipelago, and remain navigable during the whole year, being\r\nprotected from the fury of the north-easterly winds by the sheltering\r\npeninsula of Luzon, which projects to the south-east, and by Samar,\r\nwhich extends in a parallel direction; while the Bisayan islands\r\nshield them from the blasts that blow from the south-west. The\r\nIslands of Mindoro, Panay, Negros, Cebu and Bohol, which Nature has\r\nplaced in close succession to each other, form the southern borders\r\nof the straits; and the narrow cross channels between them form as\r\nmany outlets to the Sea of Mindoro, which is bounded on the west\r\nby Palawan, on the east by Mindanao, and on the south by the Sulu\r\ngroup. The eastern waters of the straits wash the coasts of Samar\r\nand Leyte, and penetrate through three small channels only to the\r\ngreat ocean; the narrow straits of San Bernardino, of San Juanico,\r\nand of Surigao. Several considerable, and innumerable smaller islets,\r\nlie within the area of these cursorily explained outlines.\r\n\r\n[Batangas coast.] A couple of bays on the south coast of Batangas\r\noffer a road-stead, though but little real protection, to passing\r\nvessels, which in stormy weather make for Porto Galera, in the Island\r\nof Mindoro, which lies directly opposite. A river, a league and a\r\nhalf in length, joins Taal, the principal port of the province, to\r\nthe great inland sea of Taal, or Bombon. This stream was formerly\r\nnavigable; but it has now become so sanded up that it is passable\r\nonly at flood tides, and then only by very small vessels.\r\n\r\n[Batangas exports.] The province of Batangas supplies Manila with\r\nits best cattle, and exports sugar and coffee.\r\n\r\nA hilly range bounds the horizon on the Luzon side; the striking\r\noutlines of which enable one to conjecture its volcanic origin. Most\r\nof the smaller islands to the south appear to consist of superimposed\r\nmountainous ranges, terminating seaward in precipitous cliffs. The\r\nlofty and symmetrical peak of Mount Mayon is the highest point in the\r\npanoramic landscape. Towards evening we sighted Mount Bulusan, in the\r\nsouth-eastern extremity of Luzon; and presently we turned northwards,\r\nand sailed up the Straits of San Bernardino, which separate Luzon\r\nfrom Samar.\r\n\r\n[Bulusan like Vesuvius.] The Bulusan volcano, \"which appears to have\r\nbeen for a long time extinct, but which again began to erupt in 1852,\"\r\n[71] is surprisingly like Vesuvius in outline. It has, like its\r\nprototype, a couple of peaks. The western one, a bell-shaped summit,\r\nis the eruption cone. The eastern apex is a tall, rugged mound,\r\nprobably the remains of a huge circular crater. As in Vesuvius, the\r\npresent crater is in the center of the extinct one. The intervals\r\nbetween them are considerably larger and more uneven than the Atrio\r\ndel Cavallo of the Italian volcano.\r\n\r\n[San Bernardino current.] The current is so powerful in the Straits\r\nof San Bernardino that we were obliged to anchor twice to avoid\r\nbeing carried back again. To our left we had continually in view the\r\nmagnificent Bulusan volcano, with a hamlet of the same name nestling at\r\nthe foot of its eastern slope in a grove of coco-trees, close to the\r\nsea. Struggling with difficulty against the force of the current, we\r\nsucceeded, with the assistance of light and fickle winds, in reaching\r\nLegaspi, the port of Albay, on the following evening. Our skipper, a\r\nSpaniard, had determined to accomplish the trip as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\n[A native captain.] On my return voyage, however, I fell into the hands\r\nof a native captain; and, as my cruise under his auspices presented\r\nmany peculiarities, I may quote a few passages relating to it from\r\nmy diary.... The skipper intended to have taken a stock of vegetables\r\nfor my use, but he had forgotten them. He therefore landed on a small\r\nisland, and presently made his reappearance with a huge palm cabbage,\r\nwhich, in the absence of its owner, he had picked from a tree he\r\ncut down for the purpose.... On another occasion the crew made a\r\ndescent upon a hamlet on the north-western coast of Leyte to purchase\r\nprovisions. Instead of laying in a stock for the voyage at Tacloban,\r\nthe sailors preferred doing so at some smaller village on the shores\r\nof the straits, where food is cheaper, and where their landing gave\r\nthem a pretext to run about the country. The straits of San Juanico,\r\nnever more than a mile, and often only eight hundred feet broad,\r\nare about twenty miles in length: yet it often takes a vessel a week\r\nto sail up them; for contrary winds and an adverse current force it\r\nto anchor frequently and to lie to for whole nights in the narrower\r\nplaces. Towards evening our captain thought that the sky appeared\r\nvery threatening, so he made for the bay of Navo, of Masbate. [An\r\nintermittent voyage.] There he anchored, and a part of the crew went\r\non shore. The next day was a Sunday; the captain thought \"the sky\r\nstill appeared very threatening;\" and besides he wanted to make some\r\npurchases. So we anchored again off Magdalena, where we passed the\r\nnight. On Monday a favorable wind took us, at a quicker rate, past\r\nMarinduque and the rocky islet of Elefante, which lies in front of\r\nit. Elefante appears to be an extinct volcano; it looks somewhat like\r\nthe Iriga, but is not so lofty. It is covered with capital pasture,\r\nand its ravines are dotted with clumps of trees. Nearly a thousand\r\nhead of half-wild cattle were grazing on it. They cost four dollars\r\na-piece; and their freight to Manila is as much more, where they sell\r\nfor sixteen dollars. They are badly tended, and many are stolen by\r\nthe passing sailors. My friend the captain was full of regret that the\r\nfavorable wind gave him no opportunity of landing; perhaps I was the\r\nreal obstacle. \"They were splendid beasts! How easy it would be to put\r\na couple on board! They could scarcely be said to have any real owners;\r\nthe nominal proprietors were quite unaware how many they possessed,\r\nand the herd was continually multiplying without any addition from its\r\nmasters. A man lands with a little money in his pocket. If he meets a\r\nherdsman, he gives him a dollar, and the poor creature thinks himself\r\na lucky fellow. If not, so much the better. He can do the business\r\nhimself; a barrel of shot or a sling suffices to settle the matter.\"\r\n\r\n[Plunder.] As we sailed along we saw coming towards us another vessel,\r\nthe Luisa, which suddenly executed a very extraordinary tack; and in a\r\nminute or two its crew sent up a loud shout of joy, having succeeded\r\nin stealing a fishbox which the fishermen of Marinduque had sunk in\r\nthe sea. They had lowered a hook, and been clever enough to grapple\r\nthe rope of the floating buoy. Our captain was beside himself with\r\nenvy of their prize.\r\n\r\n[Legaspi.] Legaspi is the principal port of the province of Albay. Its\r\nroad-stead, however, is very unsafe, and, being exposed to the\r\nnorth-easterly storms, is perfectly useless during the winter. The\r\nnorth-east wind is the prevailing one on this coast; the south-west\r\nbreeze only blows in June and July. The heaviest storms occur between\r\nOctober and January. They generally set in with a gentle westerly wind,\r\naccompanied with rain. The gale presently veers round to the north\r\nor the south, and attains the height of its fury when it reaches\r\nthe north-east or the south-east. After the storm a calm generally\r\nreigns, succeeded by the usual wind of the prevailing monsoon. The\r\nlightly-built elastic houses of the country are capitally suited\r\nto withstand these storms; but roofs and defective houses are\r\nfrequently carried away. The traffic between Manila and Legaspi is\r\nat its height between January and October; but during the autumn\r\nmonths all communication by water ceases. The letter-post, which\r\narrives pretty regularly every week, is then the only link between\r\nthe two places. At this season heavy packages can be sent only by\r\na circuitous and expensive route along the south coast, and thence\r\nby water to Manila. Much more favorably situated for navigation is\r\nthe port of [Sorsogon.] Sorsogon, the mouth of which opens to the\r\nwest, and is protected by the Island of Bagalao, which lies in front\r\nof it. Besides its security as a harbor, it has the advantage of a\r\nrapid and unbroken communication with the capital of the archipelago,\r\nwhile vessels sailing from Legaspi, even at the most favorable time\r\nof the year, are obliged to go round the eastern peninsula of Luzon,\r\nand meet the principal current of the Straits of San Bernardino,\r\nfrequently a very difficult undertaking; and, moreover, small vessels\r\nobliged to anchor there are in great danger of being captured by\r\npirates. The country about Sorsogon, however, is not so fertile as\r\nthe neighborhood of Legaspi.\r\n\r\n[A worthy official.] I took letters of introduction with me to both\r\nthe Spanish authorities of the province; who received me in the most\r\namiable way, and were of the greatest use to me during the whole of\r\nmy stay in the vicinity. I had also the good fortune to fall in with\r\na model alcalde, a man of good family and of most charming manners;\r\nin short, a genuine caballero. To show the popular appreciation of\r\nthe honesty of his character, it was said of him in Samar that he\r\nhad entered the province with nothing but a bundle of papers, and\r\nhad left it as lightly equipped.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n[Daraga.] My Spanish friends enabled me to rent a house in Daraga,\r\n[72] a well-to-do town of twenty thousand inhabitants at the foot\r\nof the Mayon, a league and a half from Legaspi. The summit of this\r\nvolcano was considered inaccessible until two young Scotchmen, Paton\r\nand Stewart by name, demonstrated the contrary. [73] Since then\r\nseveral natives have ascended the mountain, but no Europeans.\r\n\r\n[Ascent of Mayon.] I set out on September 25th, and passed the night,\r\nby the advice of Señor Muños, in a hut one thousand feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, in order to begin the ascent the next morning with\r\nunimpaired vigor. But a number of idlers who insisted on following\r\nme, and who kept up a tremendous noise all night, frustrated the\r\npurpose of this friendly advice; and I started about five in the\r\nmorning but little refreshed. The fiery glow I had noticed about the\r\ncrater disappeared with the dawn. The first few hundred feet of the\r\nascent were covered with a tall grass quite six feet high; and then\r\ncame a slope of a thousand feet or so of short grass succeeded by a\r\nquantity of moss; but even this soon disappeared, and the whole of\r\nthe upper part of the mountain proved entirely barren. We reached\r\nthe summit about one o'clock. It was covered with fissures which\r\ngave out sulphurous gases and steam in such profusion that we were\r\nobliged to stop our mouths and nostrils with our handkerchiefs to\r\nprevent ourselves from being suffocated. We came to a halt at the\r\nedge of a broad and deep chasm, from which issued a particularly\r\ndense vapor. Apparently we were on the brink of a crater, but the\r\nthick fumes of the disagreeable vapor made it impossible for us to\r\nguess at the breadth of the fissure. The absolute top of the volcano\r\nconsisted of a ridge, nearly ten feet thick, of solid masses of stone\r\ncovered with a crust of lava bleached by the action of the escaping\r\ngas. Several irregular blocks of stone lying about us showed that the\r\npeak had once been a little higher. When, now and again, the gusts\r\nof wind made rifts in the vapor, we perceived on the northern corner\r\nof the plateau several rocky columns at least a hundred feet high,\r\nwhich had hitherto withstood both storm and eruption. I afterwards\r\nhad an opportunity of observing the summit from Daraga with a capital\r\ntelescope on a very clear day, when I noticed that the northern side\r\nof the crater was considerably higher than its southern edge.\r\n\r\n[The descent.] Our descent took some time. We had still two-thirds\r\nof it beneath us when night overtook us. In the hope of reaching\r\nthe hut where we had left our provisions, we wandered about till\r\neleven o'clock, hungry and weary, and at last were obliged to wait\r\nfor daylight. This misfortune was owing not to our want of proper\r\nprecaution, but to the unreliability of the carriers. Two of them,\r\nwhom we had taken with us to carry water and refreshments, had\r\ndisappeared at the very first; and a third, \"a very trustworthy\r\nman,\" whom we had left to take care of our things at the hut, and\r\nwho had been ordered to meet us at dusk with torches, had bolted,\r\nas I afterwards discovered, back to Daraga before noon. My servant,\r\ntoo, who was carrying a woolen blanket and an umbrella for me,\r\nsuddenly vanished in the darkness as soon as it began to rain, and\r\nthough I repeatedly called him, never turned up again till the next\r\nmorning. We passed the wet night upon the bare rocks, where, as our\r\nvery thin clothes were perfectly wet through, we chilled till our\r\nteeth chattered. As soon, however, as the sun rose we got so warm\r\nthat we soon recovered our tempers. Towards nine o'clock we reached\r\nthe hut and got something to eat after twenty-nine hours' fast.\r\n\r\n[A suspicious medal.] In the Trabajos y Hechos Nolables de la\r\nSoc. Econom. de los Amigos del Pais, for September 4th, 1823, it is\r\nsaid that \"Don Antonio Siguenza paid a visit to the volcano of Albay\r\non March 11th,\" and that the Society \"ordered a medal to be struck in\r\ncommemoration of the event, and in honor of the aforesaid Siguenza and\r\nhis companions.\" Everybody in Albay, however, assured me that the two\r\nScotchmen were the first to reach the top of the mountain. It is true\r\nthat in the above notice the ascent of the volcano is not directly\r\nmentioned; but the fact of the medal naturally leads us to suppose\r\nthat nothing less can be referred to. Arenas, in his memoir, says:\r\n\"Mayon was surveyed by Captain Siguenza. From the crater to the base,\r\nwhich is nearly at the level of the sea, he found that it measured\r\nsixteen hundred and eighty-two Spanish feet or four sixty-eight and\r\ntwo-third meters.\" A little further on, he adds, that he had read\r\nin the records of the Society that they had had a gold medal struck\r\nin honor of Siguenza, who had made some investigations about the\r\nvolcano's crater in 1823. He, therefore, appears to have had some\r\ndoubt about Siguenza's actual ascent.\r\n\r\n[An early friar attempt.] According to the Franciscan records a couple\r\nof monks attempted the ascent in 1592, in order to cure the natives\r\nof their superstitious belief about the mountain. One of them never\r\nreturned; but the other, although he did not reach the summit, being\r\nstopped by three deep abysses, made a hundred converts to Christianity\r\nby the mere relation of his adventures. He died in the same year,\r\nin consequence, it is recorded, of the many variations of temperature\r\nto which he was exposed in his ascent of the volcano.\r\n\r\n[Estimates of height] Some books say that the mountain is of\r\nconsiderable height; but the Estado Geografico of the Franciscans for\r\n1855, where one could scarcely expect to find such a thoughtless\r\nrepetition of so gross a typographical error, says that the\r\nmeasurements of Siguenza give the mountain a height of sixteen\r\nhundred and eighty-two feet. According to my own barometrical reading,\r\nthe height of the summit above the level of the sea was twenty-three\r\nhundred and seventy-four meters, or eighty-five hundred and fifty-nine\r\nSpanish feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\n[An accident and a month's rest.] I sprained my foot so badly in\r\nascending Mayon that I was obliged to keep the house for a month. Under\r\nthe circumstances, I was not sorry to find myself settled in a roomy\r\nand comfortable dwelling. My house was built upon the banks of a\r\nsmall stream, and stood in the middle of a garden in which coffee,\r\ncacao, oranges, papayas, and bananas grew luxuriantly, in spite of\r\nthe tall weeds which surrounded them. Several over-ripe berries had\r\nfallen to the ground, and I had them collected, roasted, mixed with\r\nan equal quantity of sugar, and made into chocolate; an art in which\r\nthe natives greatly excel. With the Spaniards chocolate takes the\r\nplace of coffee and tea, and even the mestizos and the well-to-do\r\nnatives drink a great deal of it.\r\n\r\n[Cacao] The cacao-tree comes from Central America. It flourishes\r\nthere between the 23rd parallel north and the 20th south latitude;\r\nbut it is only at its best in the hottest and dampest climates. In\r\ntemperate climates, where the thermometer marks less than 23° C.,\r\nit produces no fruit.\r\n\r\n[High quality.] It was first imported into the Philippines from\r\nAcapulco; either, according to Camarines, by a pilot called Pedro\r\nBrabo de Lagunas, in 1670; or, according to Samar, by some Jesuits,\r\nduring Salcedo's government, between 1663 and 1668. Since then\r\nit has spread over the greater part of the Island; and, although\r\nit is not cultivated with any excessive care, its fruit is of\r\nexcellent quality. The cacao of Albay, if its cheapness be taken into\r\nconsideration, may be considered at least equal to that of Caracas,\r\nwhich is so highly-prized in Europe, and which, on account of its\r\nhigh price, generally is largely mixed with inferior kinds. [74]\r\nThe bushes are usually found in small gardens, close to the houses;\r\nbut so great is the native laziness that frequently the berries are\r\nallowed to decay, although the local cacao sells for a higher price\r\nthan the imported. At Cebu and Negros a little more attention is paid\r\nto its cultivation; [Scanty production.] but it does not suffice to\r\nsupply the wants of the colony, which imports the deficiency from\r\nTernate and Mindanao. The best cacao of the Philippines is produced in\r\nthe small Island of Maripipi, which lies to the north-west of Leyte;\r\nand it is difficult to obtain, the entire crop generally being long\r\nbespoke. It costs about one dollar per liter, whereas the Albay cacao\r\ncosts from two to two and a half dollars per \"ganta\" (three liters).\r\n\r\n[Culture.] The natives generally cover the kernels, just as they\r\nare beginning to sprout, with a little earth, and, placing them\r\nin a spirally-rolled leaf, hang them up beneath the roof of their\r\ndwellings. They grow very rapidly, and, to prevent their being\r\nchoked by weeds, are planted out at very short intervals. This\r\nmethod of treatment is probably the reason that the cacao-trees in\r\nthe Philippines never attain a greater height than eight or ten feet,\r\nwhile in their native soil they frequently reach thirty, and sometimes\r\neven forty feet. The tree begins to bear fruit in its third or fourth\r\nyear, and in its fifth or sixth it reaches maturity, when it usually\r\nyields a \"ganta\" of cacao, which, as I have mentioned, is worth from\r\ntwo to two and a half dollars, and always finds a purchaser. [75]\r\n\r\n[Neglect.] The profits arising from a large plantation would,\r\ntherefore, be considerable; yet it is very rare to meet with one. I\r\nheard it said that the Economical Society had offered a considerable\r\nreward to any one who could exhibit a plantation of ten thousand\r\nberry-bearing trees; but in the Society's report I found no mention\r\nof this reward.\r\n\r\n[Damage by storms.] The great obstacles in the way of large plantations\r\nare the heavy storms which recur almost regularly every year,\r\nand often destroy an entire plantation in a single day. In 1856 a\r\nhurricane visited the Island just before the harvest, and completely\r\ntore up several large plantations by the roots; a catastrophe that\r\nnaturally has caused much discouragement to the cultivators. [76]\r\nOne consequence of this state of things was that the free importation\r\nof cacao was permitted, and people were enabled to purchase Guayaqual\r\ncacao at fifteen dollars per quintal while that grown at home cost\r\ndouble the money.\r\n\r\n[Diseases and pests.] The plant is sometimes attacked by a disease,\r\nthe origin of which is unknown, when it suffers severely from certain\r\nnoxious insects. [77] It is also attacked by rats and other predatory\r\nvermin; the former sometimes falling upon it in such numbers that\r\nthey destroy the entire harvest in a single night. Travellers in\r\nAmerica say that a well-kept cacao plantation is a very picturesque\r\nsight. In the Philippines, however, or at any rate in East Luzon,\r\nthe closely-packed, lifeless-looking, moss-covered trees present a\r\ndreary spectacle. Their existence is a brief one. Their oval leaves,\r\nsometimes nearly a foot long, droop singly from the twigs, and form\r\nno luxuriant masses of foliage. Their blossoms are very insignificant;\r\nthey are of a reddish-yellow, no larger than the flowers of the lime,\r\nand grow separately on long weedy stalks. The fruit ripens in six\r\nmonths. When it is matured, it is of either a red or a yellow tint,\r\nand is somewhat like a very rough gherkin. Only two varieties appear to\r\nbe cultivated in the Philippines. [78] The pulp of the fruit is white,\r\ntender, and of an agreeable acid taste, and contains from eighteen\r\nto twenty-four kernels, arranged in five rows. These kernels are as\r\nlarge as almonds, and, like them, consist of a couple of husks and a\r\nsmall core. This is the cacao bean; which, roasted and finely ground,\r\nproduces cacao, and with the addition of sugar, and generally of\r\nspice, makes chocolate. Till the last few years, every household\r\nin the Philippines made its own chocolate, of nothing but cacao\r\nand sugar. The natives who eat chocolate often add roasted rice to\r\nit. Nowadays there is a manufactory in Manila, which makes chocolate\r\nin the European way. The inhabitants of the eastern provinces are\r\nvery fond of adding roasted pili nuts to their chocolate. [79]\r\n\r\n[Chocolate.] Europeans first learnt to make a drink from cacao in\r\nMexico, where the preparation was called chocolatl. [80] Even so far\r\nback as the days of Cortes, who was a tremendous chocolate drinker,\r\nthe cacao-tree was extensively cultivated. The Aztecs used the beans\r\nas money; and Montezuma used to receive part of his tribute in this\r\npeculiar coin. It was only the wealthy among the ancient Mexicans\r\nwho ate pure cacao; the poor, on account of the value of the beans\r\nas coins, used to mix maize and mandioca meal with them. Even in our\r\nown day the inhabitants of Central America make use of the beans as\r\nsmall coins, as they have no copper money, nor smaller silver coins\r\nthan the half-real. Both in Central America and in Orinoco there yet\r\nare many unpenetrated forests which are almost entirely composed of\r\nwild cacao-trees. I believe the natives gather some of their fruit,\r\nbut it is almost worthless. By itself it has much less flavor than the\r\ncultivated kinds. Certainly it is not picked and dried at the proper\r\nseason, and it gets spoilt in its long transit through the damp woods.\r\n\r\n[An uncertain venture.] Since the abolition of slavery, the crops in\r\nAmerica have been diminishing year by year, and until a short time ago,\r\nwhen the French laid out several large plantations in Central America,\r\nwere of but trifling value. According to F. Engel, a flourishing\r\ncacao plantation required less outlay and trouble, and yields more\r\nprofit than any other tropical plant; yet its harvests, which do not\r\nyield anything for the first five or six years, are very uncertain,\r\nowing to the numerous insects which attack the plants. In short,\r\ncacao plantations are only suited to large capitalists, or to very\r\nsmall cultivators who grow the trees in their own gardens. Moreover,\r\nas we have said, since the abolition of slavery most of the plantations\r\nhave fallen into decay, for the freed slaves are entirely wanting\r\nin industry.\r\n\r\n[Use in Europe.] The original chocolate was not generally relished\r\nin Europe. When, however, at a later period, it was mixed with sugar,\r\nit met with more approbation. The exaggerated praise of its admirers\r\nraised a bitter opposition amongst the opponents of the new drink;\r\nand the priests raised conscientious scruples against the use of so\r\nnourishing an article of food on fast days. The quarrel lasted till\r\nthe seventeenth century, by which time cacao had become an everyday\r\nnecessity in Spain. It was first introduced into Spain in 1520; but\r\nchocolate, on account of the monopoly of the Conquistadores, was for a\r\nlong time secretly prepared on the other side of the ocean. In 1580,\r\nhowever, it was in common use in Spain, though it was so entirely\r\nunknown in England that, in 1579, an English captain burnt a captured\r\ncargo of it as useless. It reached Italy in 1606, and was introduced\r\ninto France by Anne of Austria. The first chocolate-house in London\r\nwas opened in 1657, and in 1700 Germany at last followed suit. [81]\r\n\r\n[Coffee.] The history of coffee in the Philippines is very similar\r\nto that of cacao. The plant thrives wonderfully, and its berry has\r\nso strongly marked a flavor that the worst Manila coffee commands as\r\nhigh a price as the best Java. In spite of this, however, the amount\r\nof coffee produced in the Philippines is very insignificant, and,\r\nuntil lately, scarcely deserved mention. According to the report of an\r\nEnglishman in 1828, the coffee-plant was almost unknown forty years\r\nbefore, and was represented only by a few specimens in the Botanical\r\nGardens at Manila. It soon, however, increased and multiplied, thanks\r\nto the moderation of a small predatory animal (paradoxurus musanga),\r\nwhich only nibbled the ripe fruit, and left the hard kernels (the\r\ncoffee beans) untouched, as indigestible. The Economical Society\r\nbestirred itself in its turn by offering rewards to encourage the\r\nlaying out of large coffee plantations. In 1837 it granted to M. de\r\nla Gironnière a premium of $1,000, for exhibiting a coffee plantation\r\nof sixty thousand plants, which were yielding their second harvest;\r\nand four premiums to others in the following year. But as soon as\r\nthe rewards were obtained the plantations were once more allowed to\r\nfall into neglect. From this it is pretty evident that the enterprise,\r\nin the face of the then market prices and the artificially high rates\r\nof freight, did not afford a sufficient profit.\r\n\r\n[Exports.] In 1856 the exports of coffee were not more than seven\r\nthousand piculs; in 1865 they had increased to thirty-seven thousand,\r\nfive hundred and eighty-eight; and in 1871, to fifty-three thousand,\r\nthree hundred and seventy. This increase, however, affords no criterion\r\nby which to estimate the increase in the number of plantations,\r\nfor these make no returns for the first few years after being laid\r\nout. In short, larger exports may be confidently expected. But even\r\ngreatly increased exports could not be taken as correct measures\r\nof the colony's resources. Not till European capital calls large\r\nplantations into existence in the most suitable localities will the\r\nPhilippines obtain their proper rank in the coffee-producing districts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n[Highest grades.] The best coffee comes from the provinces of\r\nLaguna, Batangas and Cavite; the worst from Mindanao. The latter,\r\nin consequence of careless treatment, is very impure, and generally\r\ncontains a quantity of bad beans. The coffee beans of Mindanao are\r\nof a yellowish-white color and flabby; those of Laguna are smaller,\r\nbut much firmer in texture.\r\n\r\n[French preference.] Manila coffee is very highly esteemed by\r\nconnoisseurs, and is very expensive, though it is by no means so\r\nnice looking as that of Ceylon and other more carefully prepared\r\nkinds. It is a remarkable fact that in 1865 France, which imported\r\nonly $21,000 worth of hemp from the Philippines, imported more than\r\n$200,000 worth of Manila coffee, a third of the entire coffee produce\r\nof the Islands. [82] Manila coffee is not much prized in London,\r\nand does not fetch much more than good Ceylon ($15 per cwt.). [83]\r\nThis, however, is no reproach to the coffee, as every one acquainted\r\nwith an Englishman's appreciation of coffee will allow.\r\n\r\n[Prices.] California, an excellent customer, always ready to give\r\na fair price for a good article, will in time become one of its\r\nprincipal consumers. [84] In 1868, coffee in Manila itself cost\r\nan average of $16 per picul. [85] In Java, the authorities pay the\r\nnatives, who are compelled to cultivate it, about $3.66 per picul.\r\n\r\n[Philippine exports.] Although the amount of coffee exported from the\r\nPhilippines is trifling in comparison with the producing powers of the\r\ncolony, it compares favorably with the exports from other countries.\r\n\r\n[Javan and Ceylon crops.] In my Sketches of Travel, I compared the\r\ndecrease of the coffee produced in Java under the forced system of\r\ncultivation with the increase of that voluntarily grown in Ceylon,\r\nand gave the Javanese produce for 1858 as sixty-seven thousand tons,\r\nand the Cingalese as thirty-five thousand tons. Since that time the\r\nrelative decrease and increase have continued; and in 1866 the Dutch\r\nIndies produced only fifty-six thousand tons, and Ceylon thirty-six\r\nthousand tons. [86]\r\n\r\n[Amateur scientists.] During my enforced stay in Daraga the natives\r\nbrought me mussels and snails for sale; and several of them wished\r\nto enter my service, as they felt \"a particular vocation for Natural\r\nHistory.\" At last my kitchen was always full of them. They sallied\r\nforth every day to collect insects, and as a rule were not particularly\r\nfortunate in their search; but this was of no consequence; in fact,\r\nit served to give them a fresh appetite for their meals. Some of the\r\nneighboring Spaniards paid me almost daily visits; and several of\r\nthe native and mestizo dignitaries from a distance were good enough\r\nto call upon me, not so much for the purpose of seeing my humble self\r\nas of inspecting my hat, the fame of which had spread over the whole\r\nprovince. It was constructed in the usual judicious mushroom shape,\r\ncovered with nito, [87] and its pinnacle was adorned with a powerful\r\noil lamp, furnished with a closely fitting lid, like that of a dark\r\nlantern, so that it could be carried in the pocket. This last was\r\nparticularly useful when riding about on a dark night.\r\n\r\n[Nito cigar cases.] In the neighboring pueblo cigar-cases were\r\nmade out of this nito. They are not of much use as an article of\r\ncommerce, and usually are only made to order. To obtain a dozen a\r\nwould-be purchaser must apply to as many individuals, who, at the\r\nshortest, will condescend to finish one in a few months. The stalk\r\nof the fern, which is about as thick as a lucifer match, is split\r\ninto four strips. The workman then takes a strip in his left hand,\r\nand, with his thumb on the back and his forefinger on the edge, draws\r\nthe strips up and down against the knife blade until the soft pithy\r\nparts are cut away, and what remains has become fine enough for the\r\nnext process. The cases are made on pointed cylindrical pieces of\r\nwood almost a couple of feet long. A pin is stuck into the center\r\nof the end of the cylinder, and the workman commences by fastening\r\nthe strips of fern stalk to it. The size of the case corresponds to\r\nthe  diameter of the roller, and a small wooden disk is placed in the\r\nbottom of the case to keep it steady while the sides are being plaited.\r\n\r\n[A Filipino theater.] When my ankle began to get better, my\r\nfirst excursion was to Legaspi, where some Filipinos were giving\r\na theatrical performance. A Spanish political refugee directed\r\nthe entertainment. On each side of the stage, roofed in with palm\r\nleaves, ran covered galleries for the dignitaries of the place; the\r\nuncovered space between these was set apart for the common people. The\r\nperformers had chosen a play taken from Persian history. The language\r\nwas Spanish, and the dresses were, to say the least, eccentric. The\r\nstage was erected hard by a public street, which itself formed part\r\nof the auditorium, and the noise was so great that I could only catch\r\na word here and there. The actors stalked on, chattering their parts,\r\nwhich not one of them understood, and moving their arms up and down;\r\nand when they reached the edge of the stage, they tacked and went back\r\nagain like ships sailing against the wind. Their countenances were\r\nentirely devoid of expression, and they spoke like automatons. If I\r\nhad understood the words, the contrast between their meaning and the\r\nmachine-like movements of the actors would probably have been droll\r\nenough; but, as it was, the noise, the heat, and the smoke were so\r\ngreat that we soon left the place.\r\n\r\n[An indifferent performance.] Both the theatrical performance and\r\nthe whole festival bore the impress of laziness, indifference, and\r\nmindless mimicry. When I compared the frank cheerfulness I had seen\r\nradiating from every countenance at the religious holidays of Europe\r\nwith the expressionless and immobile faces of the natives, I found it\r\ndifficult to understand how the latter were persuaded to waste so much\r\ntime and money upon a matter they seemed so thoroughly indifferent to.\r\n\r\n[Interest in festival.] Travellers have remarked the same want of\r\ngaiety amongst the Indians of America; and some of them ascribe it\r\nto the small development of the nervous system prevalent among these\r\npeoples, to which cause also they attribute their wonderful courage\r\nin bearing pain. But Tylor observes that the Indian's countenance is\r\nso different from ours that it takes us several years to rightly\r\ninterpret its expression. There probably is something in both\r\nthese explanations. And, although I observed no lively expression of\r\namusement among my native friends at Legaspi, I noticed that they took\r\nthe greatest possible pleasure in decorating their village, and that\r\nthe procession which formed part of the festival had extraordinary\r\ncharms for them. Every individual was dressed in his very best; and\r\nthe honor of carrying a banner inspired those who attained it with the\r\ngreatest pride, and raised an amazing amount of envy in the breasts of\r\nthe remainder. Visitors poured in from all the surrounding hamlets, and\r\nerected triumphal arches which they had brought with them ready-made\r\nand which bore some complimentary inscription. I am obliged to confess\r\nthat some of the holiday-makers were very drunk. The inhabitants of the\r\nPhilippines have a great love for strong drink; even the young girls\r\noccasionally get intoxicated. When night came on, the strangers were\r\nhospitably lodged in the dwellings of the village. On such occasions\r\nnative hospitality shows itself in a very favorable light. The door\r\nof every house stands open, and even balls take place in some of the\r\nlarger hamlets. The Spanish and mestizo cavaliers, however, condescend\r\nto dance only with mestiza partners, and very seldom invite a pretty\r\nnative girl to join them. The natives very rarely dance together; but\r\nin Samar I was present on one occasion at a by no means ungraceful\r\nnative dance where \"improvised\" verses were sung. The male dancer\r\ncompared his partner with a rose, and she answered he should be\r\ncareful in touching it as a rose had thorns. This would have been\r\nthought a charming compliment in the mouth of an Andalusian.\r\n\r\n[Servant subterfuges.] The idle existence we spent in Daraga was so\r\nagreeable to my servants and their numerous friends that they were\r\nanxious I should stay there as long as possible; and they adopted some\r\nvery ingenious means to persuade me to do so. Twice, when everything\r\nwas prepared for a start the next morning, my shoes were stolen in the\r\nnight; and on another occasion they kidnapped my horse. When a native\r\nhas a particularly heavy load to carry, or a long journey to make,\r\nhe thinks nothing of coolly appropriating the well-fed beast of some\r\nSpaniard; which, when he has done with it, he turns loose without\r\nattempting to feed it, and it wanders about till somebody catches\r\nit and stalls it in the nearest \"Tribunal.\" There it is kept tied up\r\nand hungry until its master claims it and pays its expenses. I had a\r\ndollar to pay when I recovered mine, although it was nearly starved\r\nto death, on the pretence that it had swallowed rice to that value\r\nsince it had been caught.\r\n\r\n[Petty robberies.] Small robberies occur very frequently, but they\r\nare committed--as an acquaintance, a man who had spent some time\r\nin the country, informed me one evening when I was telling him my\r\ntroubles--only upon the property of new arrivals; old residents, he\r\nsaid, enjoyed a prescriptive freedom from such little inconveniences. I\r\nfancy some waggish native must have overheard our conversation, for\r\nearly the next morning my friend, the old resident, sent to borrow\r\nchocolate, biscuits, and eggs of me, as his larder and his hen-house\r\nhad been rifled during the night.\r\n\r\n[Daraga market.] Monday and Friday evenings were the Daraga market\r\nnights, and in fine weather always afforded a pretty sight. The\r\nwomen, neatly and cleanly clad, sat in long rows and offered their\r\nprovisions for sale by the light of hundreds of torches; and, when\r\nthe business was over, the slopes of the mountains were studded all\r\nover with flickering little points of brightness proceeding from the\r\ntorches carried by the homeward-bound market women. Besides eatables,\r\nmany had silks and stuffs woven from the fibers of the pine-apple\r\nand the banana for sale. These goods they carried on their heads;\r\nand I noticed that all the younger women were accompanied by their\r\nsweethearts, who relieved them of their burdens.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n[Change of season.] During the whole time I was confined to the\r\nhouse at Daraga, the weather was remarkably fine; but unfortunately\r\nthe bright days had come to an end by the time I was ready to make a\r\nstart, for the north-east monsoon, the sure forerunner of rain in this\r\npart of the Archipelago, sets in in October. In spite, however, of the\r\nweather, I determined to make another attempt to ascend the mountain\r\nat Bulusan. I found I could go by boat to Bacon in the Bay of Albay,\r\na distance of seven leagues, whence I could ride to Gubat, on the east\r\ncoast, three leagues further, and then in a southerly direction along\r\nthe shore to Bulusan. An experienced old native, who provided a boat\r\nand crew, had appointed ten o'clock at night as the best time for\r\nmy departure. Just as we were about to start, however, we were told\r\nthat four piratical craft had been seen in the bay. In a twinkling,\r\nthe crew disappeared, and I was left alone in the darkness; and it\r\ntook me four hours with the assistance of a Spaniard to find them\r\nagain, and make a fresh start. About nine o'clock in the morning we\r\nreached Bacon, whence I rode across a very flat country to San Roque,\r\nwhere the road leading to Gubat took a sharp turn to the south-east,\r\nand presently became an extremely bad one. After I had passed Gubat,\r\nmy way lay along the shore; and I saw several ruined square towers,\r\nmade of blocks of coral, and built by the Jesuits as a protection\r\nagainst the [Moro pirates.] Moros, or \"Moors\"--a term here applied to\r\nthe pirates, because, like the Moors who were formerly in Spain, they\r\nare Mahometans. They come from Mindanao and from the north-west coast\r\nof Borneo. At the time of my visit, this part of the Archipelago was\r\ngreatly infested with them; and a few days before my arrival they had\r\ncarried off some fishermen, who were busy pulling their fish-stakes,\r\nclose to Gubat. A little distance from the shore, and parallel to it,\r\nran a coral reef, which during the south-west monsoon was here and\r\nthere bare at low tide; but, when the north-east wind blew, the waves\r\nof the Pacific Ocean entirely concealed it. Upon this reef the storms\r\nhad cast up many remains of marine animals, and a quantity of fungi,\r\namongst which I noticed some exactly resembling the common sponge of\r\nthe Mediterranean. They were just as soft to the touch, of a dark brown\r\ntint, as large as the fist, and of a conical shape. They absorbed water\r\nwith great readiness, and might doubtless be made a profitable article\r\nof commerce. Samples of them are to be seen in the Zoological Museum at\r\nBerlin. As I went further on, I found the road excellent; and wooden\r\nbridges, all of which were in good repair, led me across the mouths\r\nof the numerous small rivers. But almost all the arches of the stone\r\nbridges I came to had fallen in, and I had to cross the streams they\r\nwere supposed to span in a small boat, and make my horse swim after\r\nme. Just before I reached Bulusan, I had to cross a ravine several\r\nhundred feet deep, composed almost entirely of white pumice stone.\r\n\r\n[Bulusan.] Bulusan is so seldom visited by strangers that the\r\n\"tribunal\" where I put up was soon full of curiosity-mongers, who came\r\nto stare at me. The women, taking the places of honor, squatted round\r\nme in concentric rows, while the men peered over their shoulders. One\r\nmorning when I was taking a shower-bath in a shed made of open bamboo\r\nwork, I suddenly noticed several pairs of inquisitive eyes staring\r\nat me through the interstices. The eyes belonged exclusively to the\r\ngentler sex; and their owners examined me with the greatest curiosity,\r\nmaking remarks upon my appearance to one another, and seeming by no\r\nmeans inclined to be disturbed. Upon another occasion, when bathing in\r\nthe open air in the province of Laguna, I was surrounded by a number of\r\nwomen, old, middle-aged, and young, who crowded round me while I was\r\ndressing, carefully inspected me, and pointed out with their fingers\r\nevery little detail which seemed to them to call for special remark.\r\n\r\n[Storm damage.] I had travelled the last part of the road to Bulusan\r\nin wind and rain; and the storm lasted with little intermission during\r\nthe whole night. When I got up in the morning I found that part of the\r\nroof of the tribunal had been carried away, that the slighter houses\r\nin the hamlet were all blown down, and that almost every dwelling in\r\nthe place had lost its roof. This pleasant weather lasted during the\r\nthree days of my stay. The air was so thick that I found it impossible\r\nto distinguish the volcano, though I was actually standing at its\r\nfoot; and, as the weather-wise of the neighborhood could hold out no\r\npromise of a favorable change at that time of the year, I put off my\r\nintended ascent till a better opportunity, and resolved to return. A\r\nformer alcalde, Peñeranda, was reported to have succeeded in reaching\r\nthe top fifteen years before, after sixty men had spent a couple of\r\nmonths in building a road to the summit; and the ascent was said to\r\nhave taken him two whole days. But an experienced native told me that\r\nin the dry season he thought four men were quite sufficient to open a\r\nnarrow path to the plateau, just under the peak, in a couple of days;\r\nbut that ladders were required to get on to the actual summit.\r\n\r\n[Arrival of assistance.] The day after my arrival the inspector of\r\nhighways and another man walked into the tribunal, both of them wet to\r\nthe skin and nearly blown to pieces. My friend the alcalde had sent\r\nthem to my assistance; and, as none of us could attempt the ascent,\r\nthey returned with me. As we were entering Bacon on our way back,\r\nwe heard the report of cannon and the sound of music. Our servants\r\ncried out \"Here comes the alcalde,\" and in a few moments he drove up\r\nin an open carriage, accompanied by an irregular escort of horsemen,\r\nSpaniards and natives, the latter prancing about in silk hats and\r\nshirts fluttering in the wind. The alcalde politely offered me a seat,\r\nand an hour's drive took us into Sorsogon.\r\n\r\n[Albay roads and bridges.] The roads of the province of Albay are good,\r\nbut they are by no means kept in good repair: a state of things that\r\nwill never be remedied so long as the indolence of the authorities\r\ncontinues. Most of the stone bridges in the district are in ruins,\r\nand the traveller is obliged to content himself with wading through a\r\nford, or get himself ferried across upon a raft or in a small canoe,\r\nwhile his horse swims behind him. The roads were first laid down in the\r\ndays of Alcalde Peñaranda, a retired officer of the engineer corps,\r\nwhom we have already mentioned, and who deserves considerable praise\r\nfor having largely contributed to the welfare of his province, and\r\nfor having accomplished so much from such small resources. He took\r\ncare that all socage service should be duly rendered, or that money,\r\nwhich went towards paying for tools and materials, should be paid\r\nin lieu of it. Many abuses existed before his rule; no real services\r\nwere performed by anybody who could trace the slightest relationship\r\nto any of the authorities; and, when by chance any redemption money\r\nwas paid, it went, often with the connivance of the alcalde of the\r\nperiod, into the pockets of the gobernadorcillos, instead of into the\r\nprovincial treasury. Similar abuses still prevail all over the country,\r\nwhere they are not prevented by the vigilance of the authorities. The\r\nnumerous population, and the prosperity which the province now enjoys,\r\nwould make it an easy matter to maintain and complete the existing\r\nhighways. The admirable officials of the district are certainly\r\nnot wanting in good-will, but their hands are tied. Nowadays the\r\nalcaldes remain only three years in one province (in Peñaranda's\r\ntime, they remained six); their time is entirely taken up with\r\nthe current official and judicial business; and, just as they are\r\nbeginning to become acquainted with the capabilities and requirements\r\nof their district, they are obliged to leave it. [Handicapped\r\nofficials.] This shows the government's want of confidence in its\r\nown servants. No alcalde could now possibly undertake what Peñaranda\r\naccomplished. The money paid in lieu of socage service, which ought to\r\nbe applied to the wants of the province in which the socage is due, is\r\nforwarded to Manila. If an alcalde proposes some urgent and necessary\r\nimprovement, he has to send in so many tedious estimates and reports,\r\nwhich frequently remain unnoticed, that he soon loses all desire to\r\nattempt any innovation. Estimates for large works, to carry out which\r\nwould require a considerable outlay, are invariably returned from\r\nheadquarters marked \"not urgent.\" [Funds diverted to Spain.] The fact\r\nis not that the colonial government is wanting in good-will, but that\r\nthe Caja de Comunidad (General Treasury) in Manila is almost always\r\nempty, as the Spanish government, in its chronic state of bankruptcy,\r\nborrows the money and is never in a position to return it.\r\n\r\n[Sorsogon earthquake.] In 1840 Sorsogon suffered severely from an\r\nearthquake, which lasted almost continuously for thirty-five days. It\r\nraged with the greatest fury on the 21st of March. The churches, both\r\nof Sorsogon and of Casiguran, as well as the smallest stone houses,\r\nwere destroyed; seventeen persons lost their lives, and two hundred\r\nwere injured; and the whole neighborhood sank five feet below its\r\nformer level.\r\n\r\n[Casiguran.] The next morning I accompanied the alcalde in a falua\r\n(felucca), manned by fourteen rowers, to Casiguran, which lies directly\r\nsouth of Sorsogon, on the other side of a small bay, of two leagues\r\nin breadth, which it took us an hour and a half to cross. The bay was\r\nas calm as an inland lake. It is almost entirely surrounded by hills,\r\nand its western side, which is open to the sea, is protected by the\r\nIsland of Bagalao, which lies in front of it. As soon as we landed,\r\nwe were received with salutes of cannon and music, and flags and\r\nshirts streamed in the wind. I declined the friendly invitation of the\r\nalcalde to accompany him any further; as to me, who had no official\r\nbusiness to transact, the journey seemed nothing but a continually\r\nrecurring panorama of dinners, lunches, cups of chocolate, music,\r\nand detonations of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n[Quicksilver.] In 1850 quicksilver was discovered on a part of the\r\ncoast now covered by the sea. I examined the reported bed of the\r\ndeposit, and it appeared to me to consist of a stratum of clay six feet\r\nin depth, superimposed over a layer of volcanic sand and fragments\r\nof pumice stone. An Englishman who was wrecked in this part of the\r\nArchipelago, the same individual I met at the iron works at Angat, had\r\nbegun to collect it, and by washing the sand had obtained something\r\nlike a couple of ounces. Somebody, however, told the priest of the\r\ndistrict that quicksilver was a poison; and, as he himself told me,\r\nso forcibly did he depict the dangerous nature of the new discovery to\r\nhis parishioners that they abandoned the attempt to collect it. Since\r\nthen none of them have ever seen a vestige of mercury, unless it might\r\nbe from some broken old barometer. Towards evening Mount Bulusan in\r\nthe south-east, and Mount Mayon in the north-west, were visible for\r\na short time. They are both in a straight line with Casiguran.\r\n\r\n[Sea's encroachments.] Every year the sea makes great inroads upon\r\nthe coast at Casiguran; as far as I could decide from its appearance\r\nand from the accounts given me, about a yard of the shore is annually\r\ndestroyed. The bay of Sorsogon is protected towards the north by a\r\nridge of hills, which suddenly terminate, however, at its north-eastern\r\nangle; and through this opening the wind sometimes blows with great\r\nfury, and causes considerable havoc in the bay, the more particularly\r\nas its coast is principally formed of clay and sand.\r\n\r\n[Pirate rumors and robberies.] When I reached Legaspi again in the\r\nevening I learnt that the alarm about the pirates which had interrupted\r\nmy departure had not been an idle one. Moros they certainly could\r\nnot have been, for at that season none of the Mahometan corsairs\r\ncould reach that part of the coast; but they were a band of deserters\r\nand vagabonds from the surrounding country, who in this part of the\r\nworld find it more agreeable to pursue their freebooting career on\r\nsea than on land. During my absence they had committed many robberies\r\nand carried off several people. [88]\r\n\r\n[Real pirates.] The beginning of November is the season of storms;\r\nwhen water communication between Albay and Manila entirely ceases,\r\nno vessel daring to put out to sea, even from the south coast. On\r\nthe 9th of the month, however, a vessel that had been given up for\r\nlost entered the port, after having incurred great perils and being\r\nobliged to throw overboard the greater part of its cargo. Within twelve\r\ndays of its leaving the straits of San Bernardino behind it, a sudden\r\nstorm compelled it to anchor amongst the Islands of Balicuatro. One\r\nof the passengers, a newly-arrived Spaniard, put off in a boat with\r\nseven sailors, and made for four small vessels which were riding at\r\nanchor off the coast; taking them for fishermen, whereas they were\r\npirates. They fired at him as soon as he was some distance from his\r\nship, and his crew threw themselves into the water; but both he and\r\nthey were taken prisoners. The captain of the trading brig, fearing\r\nthat his vessel would fall into their clutches, slipped anchor and put\r\nout to sea again, escaping shipwreck with the greatest difficulty. The\r\npirates, as a rule, do not kill their prisoners, but employ them as\r\nrowers. But Europeans seldom survive their captivity: the tremendous\r\nlabor and the scanty food are too much for them. Their clothes always\r\nbeing stripped off their back, they are exposed naked to all sorts\r\nof weather, and their sole daily support is a handful of rice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n[Camarines.] No favorable change in the weather was expected in\r\nAlbay before the month of January. It stormed and rained all day. I\r\ntherefore determined to change my quarters to South Camarines, which,\r\nprotected from the monsoon by the high range of hills running along\r\nits north-eastern boundary, enjoyed more decent weather. The two\r\nprovinces of Camarines form a long continent, with its principal\r\nfrontage of shore facing to the north-east and to the south-west;\r\nwhich is about ten leagues broad in its middle, and has its shores\r\nindented by many bays. From about the center of its north-eastern\r\nshore there boldly projects the Peninsula of Caramuan, connected with\r\nthe mainland of Camarines by the isthmus of Isarog. The north-eastern\r\nportion of the two provinces contains a long range of volcanic hills;\r\nthe south-western principally consisted, as far as my investigations\r\npermitted me to discover, of chalk, and coral reefs; in the midst\r\nof the hills extends a winding and fertile valley, which collects\r\nthe waters descending from the slopes of the mountain ranges, and\r\nblends them into a navigable river, on the banks of which several\r\nflourishing hamlets have established themselves. This river is called\r\nthe Bicol. The streams which give it birth are so abundant, and the\r\nslope of the sides of the valley, which is turned into one gigantic\r\nrice-field, is so gentle that in many places the lazy waters linger\r\nand form small lakes.\r\n\r\n[A chain of volcanoes.] Beginning at the south-eastern extremity, the\r\nvolcanoes of Bulusan, Albay, Mazaraga, Iriga, Isarog, and Colasi--the\r\nlast on the northern side of San Miguel bay--are situated in a straight\r\nline, extending from the south-east to the north-west. Besides these,\r\nthere is the volcano of Buhi, or Malinao, a little to the north-east of\r\nthe line. The hamlets in the valley I have mentioned are situated in\r\na second line parallel to that of the volcanoes. The southern portion\r\nof the province is sparsely inhabited, and but few streams find their\r\nway from its plateau into the central valley. The range of volcanoes\r\nshuts out, as I have said, the north-east winds, and condenses their\r\nmoisture in the little lakes scattered on its slopes. The south-west\r\nportion of Camarines, therefore, is dry during the north-east monsoon,\r\nand enjoys its rainy season during the prevalence of the winds that\r\nblow from the south-west. The so-called dry season which, so far as\r\nSouth Camarines is concerned, begins in November, is interrupted,\r\nhowever, by frequent showers; but from January to May scarcely a drop\r\nof rain falls. The change of monsoon takes place in May and June;\r\nand its arrival is announced by violent thunderstorms and hurricanes,\r\nwhich frequently last without cessation for a couple of weeks, and\r\nare accompanied by heavy rains. These last are the beginning of the\r\nwet season proper, which lasts till October. The road passes the\r\nhamlets of Camalig, Guinobatan, Ligao, Oas and Polangui, situated\r\nin a straight line on the banks of the river Quinali, which, after\r\nreceiving numerous tributary streams, becomes navigable soon after\r\npassing Polangui. Here I observed a small settlement of huts, which\r\nis called after the river. Each of the hamlets I have mentioned, with\r\nthe exception of the last, has a population of about fourteen thousand\r\nsouls, although they are situated not more than half a league apart.\r\n\r\n[Priestly assistance.] The convents in this part of the country are\r\nlarge, imposing buildings, and their incumbents, who were mostly old\r\nmen, were most hospitable and kind to me. Every one of them insisted\r\nupon my staying with him, and, after doing all he could for me, passed\r\nme on to his next colleague with the best recommendations. I wished\r\nto hire a boat at Polangui to cross the lake of Batu, but the only\r\ncraft I could find were a couple of barotos about eight feet long,\r\nhollowed out of the trunks of trees and laden with rice. To prevent\r\nmy meeting with any delay, the padre purchased the cargo of one of\r\nthe boats, on the condition of its being immediately unladen; and\r\nthis kindness enabled me to continue my journey in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n[The priests' importance.] If a traveller gets on good terms with\r\nthe priests he seldom meets with any annoyances. Upon one occasion\r\nI wished to make a little excursion directly after lunch, and at a\r\nquarter past eleven everything was ready for a start; when I happened\r\nto say that it was a pity to have to wait three-quarters of an hour\r\nfor the meal. In a minute or two twelve o'clock struck; all work in\r\nthe village ceased, and we sat down to table: it was noon. A message\r\nhad been sent to the village bell-ringer that the Señor Padre thought\r\nhe must be asleep, and that it must be long past twelve as the Señor\r\nPadre was hungry. Il est l'heure que votre Majesté désire.\r\n\r\n[Franciscan friars.] Most of the priests in the eastern provinces of\r\nLuzon and Samar are Franciscan monks (The barefooted friars of the\r\northodox and strictest rule of Our Holy Father St. Francis, in the\r\nPhilippine Islands, of the Holy and Apostolic Province of St. Gregory\r\nthe Great), brought up in seminaries in Spain specially devoted to the\r\ncolonial missions. Formerly they were at liberty, after ten years'\r\nresidence in the Philippines, to return to their own country; but,\r\nsince the abolition of the monasteries in Spain, they can do this\r\nno longer, for they are compelled in the colonies to abandon all\r\nobedience to the rule of their order, and to live as laymen. They are\r\naware that they must end their days in the colony, and regulate their\r\nlives accordingly. On their first arrival they are generally sent to\r\nsome priest in the province to make themselves acquainted with the\r\nlanguage of the country; then they are installed into a small parish,\r\nand afterwards into a more lucrative one, in which they generally\r\nremain till their death. Most of them spring from the very lowest\r\nclass of Spaniards. A number of pious trusts and foundations in Spain\r\nenable a very poor man, who cannot afford to send his son to school,\r\nto put him into a religious seminary, where, beyond the duties of\r\nhis future avocation, the boy learns nothing. If the monks were of\r\na higher social grade, as are some of the English missionaries, they\r\nwould have less inclination to mix with the common people, and would\r\nfail to exercise over them the influence they wield at present. The\r\nearly habits of the Spanish monks, and their narrow knowledge of the\r\nworld, peculiarly fit them for an existence among the natives. This\r\nmental equality, or rather, this want of mental disparity, has enabled\r\nthem to acquire the influence they undoubtedly possess.\r\n\r\n[Young men developed by responsibility.] When these young men\r\nfirst come from their seminaries they are narrow-brained, ignorant,\r\nfrequently almost devoid of education, and full of conceit, hatred of\r\nheretics, and proselytish ardor. These failings, however, gradually\r\ndisappear; the consideration and the comfortable incomes they enjoy\r\ndeveloping their benevolence. The insight into mankind and the\r\nconfidence in themselves which distinguish the lower classes of the\r\nSpaniards, and which are so amusingly exemplified in Sancho Panza,\r\nhave plenty of occasions to display themselves in the responsible\r\nand influential positions which the priests occupy. The padre is\r\nfrequently the only white man in his village, probably the only\r\nEuropean for miles around. He becomes the representative not only\r\nof religion, but of the government; he is the oracle of the natives,\r\nand his decisions in everything that concerns Europe and civilization\r\nare without appeal. His advice is asked in all important emergencies,\r\nand he has no one whom he in his turn can consult. Such a state\r\nof things naturally develops his brain. The same individuals who\r\nin Spain would have followed the plough, in the colonies carry out\r\ngreat undertakings. Without any technical education, and without any\r\nscientific knowledge, they build churches and bridges, and construct\r\nroads. [Poor architects.] The circumstances therefore are greatly in\r\nfavor of the development of priestly ability; but it would probably\r\nbe better for the buildings if they were erected by more experienced\r\nmen, for the bridges are remarkably prone to fall in, the churches\r\nlook like sheep-pens, and the roads soon go to rack and ruin. I\r\nhad much intercourse in Camarines and Albay with the priests, and\r\nconceived a great liking for them all. As a rule, they are the most\r\nunpretending of men; and a visit gives them so much pleasure that\r\nthey do all in their power to make their guest's stay as agreeable as\r\npossible. Life in a large convent has much resemblance to that of a\r\nlord of the manor in Eastern Europe. Nothing can be more unconstrained,\r\nmore unconventional. A visitor lives as independently as in an hotel,\r\nand many of the visitors behave themselves as if it were one. I have\r\nseen a subaltern official arrive, summon the head servant, move into\r\na room, order his meal, and then inquire casually whether the padre,\r\nwho was an utter stranger to him, was at home.\r\n\r\nThe priests of the Philippines have often been reproached with gross\r\nimmorality. They are said to keep their convents full of bevies of\r\npretty girls, and to lead somewhat the same sort of life as the Grand\r\nTurk. This may be true of the native padres; but I myself never saw,\r\nin any of the households of the numerous Spanish priests I visited,\r\nanything that could possibly cause the least breath of scandal. Their\r\nservants were exclusively men, though perhaps I may have noticed\r\nhere and there an old woman or two. Ribadeneyra says:--\"The natives,\r\nwho observe how careful the Franciscan monks are of their chastity,\r\nhave arrived at the conclusion that they are not really men, and\r\nthat, though the devil had often attempted to lead these holy men\r\nastray, using the charms of some pretty Indian girl as a bait, yet,\r\nto the confusion of both damsel and devil, the monks had always\r\ncome scathless out of the struggle.\" Ribadeneyra, however, is a very\r\nunreliable author; and, if his physiological mistakes are as gross as\r\nhis geographical ones (he says somewhere that Luzon is another name\r\nfor the island of Cebu!), the monks are not perhaps as fireproof as\r\nhe supposes. At any rate, his description does not universally apply\r\nnowadays. The younger priests pass their existence like the lords of\r\nthe soil of old; the young girls consider it an honor to be allowed to\r\nassociate with them; and the padres in their turn find many convenient\r\nopportunities. They have no jealous wives to pry into their secrets,\r\nand their position as confessors and spiritual advisers affords them\r\nplenty of pretexts for being alone with the women. The confessional,\r\nin particular, must be a perilous rock-a-head for most of them. In\r\nan appendix to the \"Tagal Grammar\" (which, by-the-bye, is not added\r\nto the editions sold for general use) a list of questions is given\r\nfor the convenience of young priests not yet conversant with the\r\nTagal language. These questions are to be asked in the confessional,\r\nand several pages of them relate exclusively to the relations between\r\nthe sexes.\r\n\r\n[Superiority over government officials.] As the alcaldes remain only\r\nthree years in any one province, they never understand much of its\r\nlanguage; and, being much occupied with their official business,\r\nthey have neither the time nor the desire to become acquainted\r\nwith the peculiarities of the districts over which they rule. The\r\npriest, on the other hand, resides continually in the midst of his\r\nparishioners, is perfectly acquainted with each of them, and even,\r\non occasion, protects them against the authorities; his, therefore,\r\nis the real jurisdiction in the district. The position of the priests,\r\nin contradistinction to that of the government officials, is well\r\nexpressed by their respective dwellings. The casas reales, generally\r\nsmall, ugly, and frequently half-ruined habitations, are not suited\r\nto the dignity of the chief authority of the province. The convento,\r\non the contrary, is almost always a roomy, imposing, and well-arranged\r\nbuilding. In former days, when governorships were sold to adventurers\r\nwhose only care was to enrich themselves, the influence of the minister\r\nof religion was even greater than it is now. [89]\r\n\r\n[Former legal status.] The following extract from the General\r\nOrders, given by Le Gentil, will convey a clear idea of their former\r\nposition:--\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the tenth chapter of the ordinances, wherein the governor of\r\nArandia ordained that the alcaldes and the justices should communicate\r\nwith the missionary priests only by letter, and that they should never\r\nhold any interview with them except in the presence of a witness, has\r\nbeen frequently disobeyed, it is now commanded that these disobediences\r\nshall no longer be allowed; and that the alcaldes shall make it their\r\nbusiness to see that the priests and ministers of religion treat the\r\ngobernadorcillos and the subaltern officers of justice with proper\r\nrespect, and that the aforesaid priests be not allowed either to beat,\r\nchastise, or ill-treat the latter, or make them wait at table.\"\r\n\r\n[Alcaldes formerly in trade.] The former alcaldes who, without\r\nexperience in official business, without either education or knowledge,\r\nand without either the brains or the moral qualifications for such\r\nresponsible and influential posts, purchased their appointments from\r\nthe State, or received them in consequence of successful intrigues,\r\nreceived a nominal salary from the government, and paid it tribute for\r\nthe right to carry on trade. Arenas considered this tribute paid by the\r\nalcaldes as a fine imposed upon them for an infringement of the law;\r\n\"for several ordinances were in existence, strenuously forbidding\r\nthem to dabble in any kind of commerce, until it pleased his Catholic\r\nMajesty to grant them a dispensation.\" The latter sources of mischief\r\nwere, however, abolished by royal decree in September and October,\r\n1844.\r\n\r\n[Their borrowed capital.] The alcaldes were at the same time governors,\r\nmagistrates, commanders of the troops, and, in reality, the only\r\ntraders in their province. [90] They purchased with the resources\r\nof the obras pias the articles required in the province; and they\r\nwere entirely dependent for their capital upon these endowments,\r\nas they almost always arrived in the Philippines without any means\r\nof their own. The natives were forced to sell their produce to the\r\nalcaldes and, besides, to purchase their goods at the prices fixed\r\nby the latter. [91] In this corrupt state of things the priests were\r\nthe only protectors of the unfortunate Filipinos; though occasionally\r\nthey also threw in their lot with the alcaldes, and shared in the\r\nspoil wrung from their unfortunate flocks.\r\n\r\n[Improvement in present appointees.] Nowadays men with some knowledge\r\nof the law are sent out to the Philippines as alcaldes; the government\r\npays them a small salary, and they are not allowed to trade. The\r\nauthorities also attempt to diminish the influence of the priests by\r\nimproving the position of the civil tribunals; a state of things they\r\nwill not find easy of accomplishment unless they lengthen the period\r\nof service of the alcaldes, and place them in a pecuniary position\r\nthat will put them beyond the temptation of pocketing perquisites. [92]\r\n\r\nIn Huc's work on China I find the following passage, relating to the\r\neffects of the frequent official changes in China, from which many\r\nhints may be gathered:--\r\n\r\n[Similarity with Chinese conditions.] \"The magisterial offices\r\nare no longer bestowed upon upright and just individuals and, as a\r\nconsequence, this once flourishing and well-governed kingdom is day\r\nby day falling into decay, and is rapidly gliding down the path that\r\nleads to a terrible and, perhaps, speedy dissolution. When we seek\r\nto discover the cause of the general ruin, the universal corruption\r\nwhich too surely is undermining all classes of Chinese society, we are\r\nconvinced that it is to be found in the complete abandonment of the\r\nold system of government effected by the Manchu dynasty. It issued\r\na decree forbidding any mandarin to hold any post longer than three\r\nyears in the same province, and prohibiting any one from possessing\r\nany official appointment in his native province. One does not form\r\na particularly high idea of the brain which conceived this law; but,\r\nwhen the Manchu Tartars found that they were the lords of the empire,\r\nthey began to be alarmed at their small numbers, which were trifling\r\nin comparison with the countless swarms of the Chinese; and they\r\ndreaded lest the influence which the higher officials would acquire\r\nin their districts might enable them to excite the populace against\r\ntheir foreign rulers.\r\n\r\n[Unidentified with country.] \"The magistrates, being allowed to\r\nremain only a year or two in the same province, lived there like\r\nstrangers, without acquainting themselves with the wants of the people\r\nthey governed; there was no tie between them. The only care of the\r\nmandarins was to amass as much wealth as possible before they quitted\r\ntheir posts; and they then began the same game in a fresh locality,\r\nuntil finally they returned home in possession of a handsome fortune\r\ngradually collected in their different appointments. They were only\r\nbirds of passage. What did it matter? The morrow would find them\r\nat the other end of the kingdom, where the cries of their plundered\r\nvictims would be unable to reach them. In this manner the governmental\r\npolicy rendered the mandarins selfish and indifferent. The basis\r\nof the monarchy is destroyed, for the magistrate is no longer a\r\npaternal ruler residing amongst and mildly swaying his children, but a\r\nmarauder, who arrives no man knows whence, and who departs no one knows\r\nwhither. The consequence is universal stagnation; no great undertakings\r\nare accomplished; and the works and labors of former dynasties are\r\nallowed to fall into decay. The mandarins say to themselves: 'Why\r\nshould we undertake what we can never accomplish? Why should we sow\r\nthat others may reap?'... They take no interest in the affairs of the\r\ndistrict; as a rule, they are suddenly transplanted into the midst of\r\na population whose dialect even they do not understand. [Dependence on\r\ninterpreters.] When they arrive in their mandarinates they usually find\r\ninterpreters, who, being permanent officieals and interested in the\r\naffairs of the place, know how to make their services indispensable;\r\nand these in reality are the absolute rulers of the district.\"\r\n\r\n[Importance of interpreters in Philippines.]  Interpreters are\r\nespecially indispensable in the Philippines, where the alcaldes never\r\nby any chance understand any of the local dialects. In important\r\nmatters the native writers have generally to deal with the priest,\r\nwho in many cases becomes the virtual administrator of authority. He is\r\nfamiliar with the characters of the inhabitants and all their affairs,\r\nin the settlement of which his intimate acquaintance with the female\r\nsex stands him in good stead. An eminent official in Madrid told me\r\nin 1867 that the then minister was considering a proposal to abolish\r\nthe restriction of office in the colonies to three years. [93]\r\n\r\n[Fear of officials' popularity.] The dread which caused this\r\nrestriction, viz., that an official might become too powerful in some\r\ndistant province, and that his influence might prove a source of danger\r\nto the mother country, is no longer entertained. Increased traffic\r\nand easier means of communication have destroyed the former isolation\r\nof the more distant provinces. The customs laws, the increasing demand\r\nfor colonial produce, and the right conceded to foreigners of settling\r\nin the country, will give a great stimulus to agriculture and commerce,\r\nand largely increase the number of Chinese and European residents. Then\r\nat last, perhaps, the authorities will see the necessity of improving\r\nthe social position of their officials by decreasing their number,\r\nby a careful selection of persons, by promoting them according to\r\ntheir abilities and conduct, and by increasing their salaries, and\r\nallowing them to make a longer stay in one post. The commercial\r\nrelations of the Philippines with California and Australia are\r\nlikely to become very active, and liberal ideas will be introduced\r\nfrom those free countries. Then, indeed, the mother country will\r\nhave earnestly to consider whether it is advisable to continue its\r\nexploitation of the colony by its monopolies, its withdrawal of gold,\r\nand its constant satisfaction of the unfounded claims of a swarm of\r\nhungry place-hunters. [94]\r\n\r\n[Different English and Dutch policy.] English and Dutch colonial\r\nofficials are carefully and expressly educated for their difficult\r\nand responsible positions. They obtain their appointments after\r\npassing a stringent examination at home, and are promoted to the\r\nhigher colonial offices only after giving proofs of fitness and\r\nability. What a different state of things prevails in Spain! When a\r\nSpaniard succeeds in getting an appointment, it is difficult to say\r\nwhether it is due to his personal capacity and merit or to a series\r\nof successful political intrigues. [95]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n[Batu.] In an hour and a half after leaving Polangui we reached Batu,\r\na village on the north-western shore of the lake of the same name. The\r\ninhabitants, particularly the women, struck me by their ugliness\r\nand want of cleanliness. Although they lived close to the lake, and\r\ndrew their daily drinking water from it, they never appeared to use\r\nit for the purpose of washing. The streets of the village also were\r\ndirty and neglected; a circumstance explained, perhaps, by the fact\r\nof the priest being a native.\r\n\r\n[The lake.] Towards the end of the rainy season, in November, the\r\nlake extends far more widely than it does in the dry, and overflows\r\nits shallow banks, especially to the south-west. A great number of\r\nwater-plants grow on its borders; amongst which I particularly noticed\r\na delicate seaweed [96], as fine as horse hair, but intertwined in such\r\nclose and endless ramifications that it forms a flooring strong enough\r\nto support the largest waterfowl. I  saw hundreds of them hopping about\r\nand eating the shell fish and prawns, which swarmed amidst the meshes\r\nof the net-like seaweed and fell an easy prey to their feathered\r\nenemies. The natives, too, were in the habit of catching immense\r\nquantities of the prawns with nets made for the purpose. Some they\r\nate fresh; and some they kept till they were putrid, like old cheese,\r\nand then used them as a relish to swallow with their rice. These\r\nsmall shell-fish are not limited to the Lake of Batu. They are caught\r\nin shoals in both the salt and the fresh waters of the Philippine\r\nand Indian archipelagos, and, when salted and dried by the natives,\r\nform an important article of food, eaten either in soup or as a kind\r\nof potted paste. They are found in every market, and are largely\r\nexported to China. I was unable to shoot any of the waterfowl, for\r\nthe tangles of the seaweed prevented my boat from getting near them.\r\n\r\n[A neglected product.] When I revisited the same lake in February,\r\nI found its waters so greatly fallen that they had left a circular\r\nbelt of shore extending all around the lake, in most places nearly a\r\nhundred feet broad. The withdrawal of the waters had compressed the\r\ntangled seaweed into a kind of matting, which, bleached by the sun,\r\nand nearly an inch thick, covered the whole of the shore, and hung\r\nsuspended over the stunted bushes which, on my first visit, had\r\nbeen under water. I have never either seen elsewhere, or heard any\r\none mention, a similar phenomenon. This stuff, which could be had\r\nfor nothing, was excellent for rifle-stoppers and for the stuffing\r\nof birds, so I took a great quantity of it with me. This time the\r\nbird-hunting went well, too.\r\n\r\nThe native priest of Batu was full of complaints about his\r\nparishioners, who gave him no opportunities of gaining an honest\r\npenny. \"I am never asked for a mass, sir; in fact, this is such a\r\nmiserable hole that it is shunned by Death itself. In D., where I was\r\nfor a long time coadjutor, we had our couple of burials regularly\r\nevery day at three dollars a head, and as many masses at a dollar\r\napiece as we had time to say, besides christenings and weddings,\r\nwhich always brought a little more grist to the mill. But here\r\nnothing takes place, and I scarcely make anything.\" This stagnant\r\nstate of things had induced him to turn his attention to commerce. The\r\naverage native priest, of those I saw, could hardly be called a credit\r\nto his profession. Generally ignorant, often dissipated, and only\r\nsuperficially acquainted with his duties, the greater part of his\r\ntime was given over to gambling, drinking, and other objectionable\r\namusements. Little care was taken to preserve a properly decorous\r\nbehavior, except when officiating in the church, when they read with\r\nan absurd assumption of dignity, without understanding a single\r\nword. The conventos are often full of girls and children, all of\r\nwhom help themselves with their fingers out of a common dish. The\r\nworthy padre of Batu introduced a couple of pretty girls to me as\r\nhis two poor sisters, whom, in spite of his poverty, he supported;\r\nbut the servants about the place openly spoke of these young ladies'\r\nbabies as being the children of the priest.\r\n\r\n[The native clergy.] The guiding principle of Spanish colonial\r\npolicy--to set one class against another, and to prevent either from\r\nbecoming too powerful--seems to be the motive for placing so many\r\nnative incumbents in the parsonages of the Archipelago. The prudence of\r\nthis proceeding, however, seems doubtful. A Spanish priest has a great\r\ndeal of influence in his own immediate circle, and forms, perhaps,\r\nthe only enduring link between the colony and the mother-country. The\r\nnative priest is far from affording any compensation for the lack\r\nof either of these advantages. He generally is but little respected\r\nby his flock, and certainly does nothing to attach them to Spain;\r\nfor he hates and envies his Spanish brethren, who leave him only the\r\nvery worst appointments, and treat him with contempt.\r\n\r\n[Nabua.] I rode from Batu to Nabua over a good road in half an\r\nhour. The country was flat, with rice-fields on both sides of the\r\nroad; but, while in Batu the rice was only just planted, in Nabua it\r\nalready was almost ripe. I was unable to obtain any explanation of\r\nthis incongruity, and know not how to account for such a difference\r\nof climate between two hamlets situated in such close proximity to\r\none another, and separated by no range of hills. The inhabitants of\r\nboth were ugly and dirty, and were different in these respects from\r\nthe Tagalogs. Nabua, a place of 10,875 inhabitants, is intersected by\r\nseveral small streams, whose waters, pouring down from the eastern\r\nhills, form a small lake, which empties itself into the river\r\nBicol. Just after passing the second bridge beyond Nabua the road,\r\ninclining eastwards, wends in a straight line to Iriga, a place lying\r\nto the south-west of the volcano of the same name.\r\n\r\n[Remontados.] I visited a small settlement of pagans situated on the\r\nslope of the volcano. The people of the plains call them indifferently\r\nIgorots, Cimarrons, Remontados, Infieles, or Montesinos. None\r\nof these names, however, with the exception of the two last, are\r\nappropriate ones. The first is derived from the term applied in the\r\nnorth of the Island to the mixed descendants of Chinese and Filipino\r\nparents. The word Cimarron (French, marrow) is borrowed from the\r\nAmerican slave colonies, where it denoted negroes who escaped from\r\nslavery and lived in a state of freedom; but here it is applied to\r\nnatives who prefer a wild existence to the comforts of village life,\r\nwhich they consider are overbalanced by the servitude and bondage\r\nwhich accompany them. The term Remontado explains itself, and has\r\nthe same signification as Cimarron. As the difference between the\r\ntwo states--on account of the mildness of the climate, and the\r\nease with which the wants of the natives are supplied--is far less\r\nthan it would be in Europe, these self-constituted exiles are more\r\nfrequently to be met with than might be supposed; the cause of their\r\nseparation from their fellowmen sometimes being some offence against\r\nthe laws, sometimes annoying debts, and sometimes a mere aversion to\r\nthe duties and labors of village life. Every Filipino has an innate\r\ninclination to abandon the hamlets and retire into the solitude of\r\nthe woods, or live isolated in the midst of his own fields; and it\r\nis only the village prisons and the priests--the salaries of the\r\nlatter are proportionate to the number of their parishioners--that\r\nprevent him from gradually turning the pueblos into visitas, [97]\r\nand the latter into ranchos. Until a visit to other ranchos in the\r\nneighborhood corrected my first impression, I took the inhabitants of\r\nthe slopes of the Iriga for cross-breeds between the low-landers and\r\nnegritos. The color of their skin was not black, but a dark brown,\r\nscarcely any darker than that of Filipinos who have been much exposed\r\nto the sun; and only a few of them had woolly hair. The negritos whom\r\nI saw at Angat and Mariveles knew nothing whatever about agriculture,\r\nlived in the open air, and supported themselves upon the spontaneous\r\nproducts of nature; but the half-savages of the Iriga dwell in decent\r\nhuts, and cultivate several vegetables and a little sugar-cane. No\r\npure negritos, as far as I could ascertain, are to be met with in\r\nCamarines. A thickly-populated province, only sparsely dotted with\r\nlofty hills, would be ill-suited for the residence of a nomadic\r\nhunting race ignorant of agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Iriga settlements.] The ranchos on the Iriga are very accessible,\r\nand their inhabitants carry on a friendly intercourse with the\r\nlowlanders; indeed, if they didn't, they would have been long\r\nago exterminated. In spite of these neighborly communications,\r\nhowever, they have preserved many of their own primitive manners and\r\ncustoms. The men go about naked with the exception of a cloth about the\r\nloins; and the women are equally unclad, some of them perhaps wearing\r\nan apron reaching from the hip to the knee. [98] In the larger ranchos\r\nthe women were decently clad in the usual Filipino fashion. Their\r\nhousehold belongings consisted of a few articles made of bamboo, a\r\nfew calabashes of coconut-shell, and an earthen cooking-pot, and bows\r\nand arrows. [Poison arrows.] These latter are made very carefully,\r\nthe shaft from reeds, the point from a sharp-cut bamboo, or from a\r\npalm-tree, with one to three sharp points. In pig-hunting iron-pointed\r\npoison arrows are used. [Crucifixes.] Although the Igorots are not\r\nChristians, they decorate their huts with crucifixes, which they use\r\nas talismans. If they were of no virtue, an old man remarked to me, the\r\nSpaniards would not employ them so numerously. [99] The largest rancho\r\nI visited was nominally under the charge of a captain, who, however,\r\nhad little real power. At my desire he called to some naked boys idly\r\nsquatting about on the trees, who required considerable persuasion\r\nbefore they obeyed his summons; but a few small presents--brazen\r\nearrings and combs for the women, and cigars for the men--soon put\r\nme on capital terms with them.\r\n\r\n[Mt. Iriga.] After a vain attempt to reach the top of the Iriga volcano\r\nI started for Buhi, a place situated on the southern shore of the lake\r\nof that name. Ten minutes after leaving Iriga I reached a spot where\r\nthe ground sounded hollow beneath my horse's feet. A succession of\r\nsmall hillocks, about fifty feet high, bordered each side of the road;\r\nand towards the north I could perceive the huge crater of the Iriga,\r\nwhich, in the distance, appeared like a truncated cone. I had the\r\ncuriosity to ascend one of the hillocks, which, seen from its summit,\r\nlooked like the remains of some former crater, which had probably\r\nbeen destroyed by an earthquake and split up into these small mounds.\r\n\r\n[Advertising.]  When I got to Buhi the friendly priest had it\r\nproclaimed by sound of drum that the newly-arrived strangers wished\r\nto obtain all kinds of animals, whether of earth, of air, or of water;\r\nand that each and all would be paid for in cash. The natives, however,\r\nonly brought us moths, centipedes, and other vermin, which, besides\r\nenabling them to have a good stare at the strangers, they hoped to\r\nturn into cash as extraordinary curiosities.\r\n\r\n[A church procession.]  The following day I was the spectator of a\r\ngorgeous procession. First came the Spanish flag, then the village\r\nkettle-drums, and a small troop of horsemen in short jackets and\r\nshirts flying in the wind, next a dozen musicians, and finally, as\r\nthe principal figure, a man carrying a crimson silk standard. The\r\nlatter individual evidently was deeply conscious of his dignified\r\nposition, and his countenance eloquently expressed the quantity of\r\npalm wine he had consumed in honor of the occasion. He sat on his\r\nhorse dressed out in the most absurd manner in a large cocked hat\r\ntrimmed with colored paper instead of gold lace, with a woman's cape\r\nmade of paper outside his coat, and with short, tight-fitting yellow\r\nbreeches and immense white stockings and shoes. Both his coat and his\r\nbreeches were liberally ornamented with paper trimmings. His steed,\r\nled by a couple of cabezas, was appointed with similar trappings. After\r\nmarching through all the streets of the village the procession came\r\nto a halt in front of the church.\r\n\r\n[Papal concessions to Spain.] This festival is celebrated every year\r\nin commemoration of the concession made by the Pope to the King of\r\nSpain permitting the latter to appropriate to his own use certain\r\nrevenues of the Church. The Spanish Throne consequently enjoys the\r\nright of conferring different indulgences, even for serious crimes, in\r\nthe name of the Holy See. This right, which, so to speak, it acquired\r\nwholesale, it sells by retail to its customers (it formerly disposed\r\nof it to the priests) in the estanco, and together with its other\r\nmonopolies, such as tobacco, brandy, lottery tickets, stamped paper,\r\netc., all through the agency of the priests; without the assistance\r\nof whom very little business would be done. The receipts from the\r\nsale of these indulgences have always been very fluctuating. In 1819\r\nthey amounted to $15,930; in 1839 to $36,390; and in 1860 they were\r\nestimated at $58,954. In the year 1844-5 they rose to $292,115. The\r\ncause of this large increase was that indulgences were then rendered\r\ncompulsory; so many being alloted to each family, with the assistance\r\nand under the superintendence of the priests and tax-collectors who\r\nreceived a commission of five and eight per cent on the gross amount\r\ncollected. [100]\r\n\r\n[Lake Buhi.] The Lake of Buhi (300 feet above the sea-level) presents\r\nan extremely picturesque appearance, surrounded as it is on all sides\r\nby hills fully a thousand feet high; and its western shore is formed by\r\nwhat still remains of the Iriga volcano. I was informed by the priests\r\nof the neighboring hamlets that the volcano, until the commencement\r\nof the seventeenth century, had been a closed cone, and that the\r\nlake did not come into existence till half of the mountain fell in,\r\nat the time of its great eruption. This statement I found confirmed\r\nin the pages of the Estado Geografico:--\"On the fourth of January,\r\n1641--a memorable day, for on that date all the known volcanoes of\r\nthe Archipelago began to erupt at the same hour--a lofty hill in\r\nCamarines, inhabited by heathens, fell in, and a fine lake sprang\r\ninto existence upon its site. The then inhabitants of the village of\r\nBuhi migrated to the shores of the new lake, which, on this account,\r\nwas henceforward called the Lake of Buhi.\"\r\n\r\n[1628 Camarines earthquake.] Perrey, in the Mémoires de l'Académie\r\nde Dijon, mentions another outbreak which took place in Camarines in\r\n1628: \"In 1628, according to trustworthy reports, fourteen different\r\nshocks of earthquake occurred on the same day in the province of\r\nCamarines. Many buildings were thrown down, and from one large\r\nmountain which the earthquake rent asunder there issued such an\r\nimmense quantity of water that the whole neighborhood was flooded,\r\ntrees were torn up by the roots, and, in one hour, from the seashore\r\nall plains were covered with water (the direct distance to the shore\r\nis two and one-half leagues).  [101]\r\n\r\n[A mistranslation.] It is very strange that the text given in the\r\nfootnote does not agree with A. Perrey's translation. The former does\r\nnot mention that water came out of the mountains and says just the\r\ncontrary, that trees, which were torn up by the roots, took the place\r\nof the sea for one hour on the shore, so that no water could be seen.\r\n\r\n[Unreliable authorities.] The data of the Estado Geografico are apt to\r\ncreate distrust as the official report on the great earthquake of 1641\r\ndescribes in detail the eruptions of three volcanoes, which happened at\r\nthe same time (of these two were in the South of the Archipelago and\r\none in Northern Luzon) while Camarines is not mentioned at all. This\r\nsuspicion is further strengthened by the fact that the same author\r\n(Nierembergius) whose remarks on the eruptions of 1628 in Camarines\r\nare quoted, gives in another book of his a detailed report on the\r\nevents of 1641 without mentioning this province. If one considers\r\nthe indifference of the friars toward such events in Nature, it is\r\nnot improbable that the eruptions of 1641 when a mountain fell in in\r\nNorthern Luzon and a lake took its place, has been transferred on the\r\nIriga. To illustrate the indifference it may be mentioned that even\r\nthe padres living at the foot of the Albay could not agree upon the\r\ndates of its very last eruptions.\r\n\r\n[Another attempt at mountain climbing.] When I was at Tambong, a small\r\nhamlet on the shore of the lake belonging to the parochial district\r\nof Buhi, I made a second unsuccessful attempt to reach the highest\r\npoint of the Iriga. We arrived in the evening at the southern point\r\nof the crater's edge (1,041 meters above the level of the sea by my\r\nbarometrical observation), where a deep defile prevented our further\r\nprogress. Here the Igorots abandoned me, and the low-landers refused\r\nto bivouac in order to pursue the journey on the following day; so I\r\nwas obliged to return. Late in the evening, after passing through a\r\ncoco plantation, we reached the foot of the mountain and found shelter\r\nfrom a tempest with a kind old woman; to whom my servants lied so\r\nshamelessly that, when the rain had abated, we were, in spite of\r\nour failure, conducted with torches to Tambong, where we found the\r\npalm-grove round the little hamlet magically illuminated with bright\r\nbonfires of dry coconut-leaves in honor of the Conquistadores del\r\nIriga; and where I was obliged to remain for the night, as the people\r\nwere too timorous or too lazy to cross the rough water of the lake.\r\n\r\n[Pineapple fiber preparations.] Here I saw them preparing the fiber\r\nof the pine-apple for weaving. The fruit of the plants selected\r\nfor this purpose is generally removed early; a process which causes\r\nthe leaves to increase considerably both in length and in breadth. A\r\nwoman places a board on the ground, and upon it a pine-apple-leaf with\r\nthe hollow side upwards. Sitting at one end of the board, she holds\r\nthe leaf firmly with her toes, and scrapes its outer surface with a\r\npotsherd; not with the sharp fractured edge but with the blunt side\r\nof the rim; and thus the leaf is reduced to rags. In this manner a\r\nstratum of coarse longitudinal fiber is disclosed, and the operator,\r\nplacing her thumb-nail beneath it, lifts it up, and draws it away\r\nin a compact strip; after which she scrapes again until a second\r\nfine layer of fiber is laid bare. Then, turning the leaf round, she\r\nscrapes its back, which now lies upwards, down to the layer of fiber,\r\nwhich she seizes with her hand and draws at once, to its full length,\r\naway from the back of the leaf. When the fiber has been washed, it is\r\ndried in the sun. It is afterwards combed, with a suitable comb, like\r\nwomen's hair, sorted into four classes, tied together, and treated like\r\nthe fiber of the lupi. In this crude manner are obtained the threads\r\nfor the celebrated web nipis de [Piña.] Piña, which is considered by\r\nexperts the finest in the world. Two shirts of this kind are in the\r\nBerlin Ethnographical Museum (Nos. 291 and 292). Better woven samples\r\nare in the Gewerbe Museum of Trade and Commerce. In the Philippines,\r\nwhere the fineness of the work is best understood and appreciated,\r\nrichly-embroidered costumes of this description have fetched more\r\nthan $1,400 each. [102]\r\n\r\n[Rain prevents another ascent.] At Buhi, which is not sufficiently\r\nsheltered towards the north-east, it rained almost as much as at\r\nDaraga. I had found out from the Igorots that a path could be forced\r\nthrough the tall canes up to the summit; but the continual rain\r\nprevented me; so I resolved to cross the Malinao, returning along the\r\ncoast to my quarters, and then, freshly equipped, descend the river\r\nBicol as far as Naga.\r\n\r\n[Mountaineers' arrow poison.] Before we parted the Igorots prepared\r\nfor me some arrow poison from the bark of two trees. I happened\r\nto see neither the leaves nor the blossoms, but only the bark. A\r\npiece of bark was beaten to pieces, pressed dry, wetted, and again\r\npressed. This was done with the bare hand, which, however, sustained\r\nno injury. The juice thus extracted looked like pea-soup, and was\r\nwarmed in an earthen vessel over a slow fire. During the process it\r\ncoagulated at the edges; and the coagulated mass was again dissolved,\r\nby stirring it into the boiling fluid mass. When this had reached\r\nthe consistency of syrup, a small quantity was scraped off the inner\r\nsurface of a second piece of bark, and its juice squeezed into the\r\nvessel. This juice was a dark brown color. When the mass had attained\r\nthe consistency of a thin jelly, it was scraped out of the pot with\r\na chip and preserved on a leaf sprinkled with ashes. For poisoning\r\nan arrow they use a piece of the size of a hazel-nut, which, after\r\nbeing warmed, is distributed uniformly over the broad iron point;\r\nand the poisoned arrow serves for repeated use.\r\n\r\n[Sapa river.] At the end of November I left the beautiful lake of\r\nBuhi, and proceeded from its eastern angle for a short distance up\r\nthe little river Sapa [103], the alluvial deposits of which form\r\na considerable feature in the configuration of the lake. Across a\r\nmarshy meadow we reached the base of the Malinao or Buhi mountain,\r\nthe slippery clay of the lower slope merging higher up into volcanic\r\nsand. [Leeches.] The damp undergrowth swarmed with small leeches;\r\nI never before met with them in such numbers. These little animals,\r\nno stouter when streched out than a linen thread, are extraordinarily\r\nactive. They attach themselves firmly to every part of the body,\r\npenetrating even into the nose, the ears, and the eyelids, where,\r\nif, they remain unobserved, they gorge themselves to such excess that\r\nthey become as round as balls and look like small cherries. While they\r\nare sucking no pain is felt; but afterwards the spots attacked often\r\nitch the whole day long.  [104] [Fig-trees.] In one place the wood\r\nconsisted for the most part of fig-trees, with bunches of fruit quite\r\nsix feet in length hanging from the stems and the thicker branches;\r\nand between the trees grew ferns, aroids, and orchids. After nearly\r\nsix hours' toil we reached the pass (841 meters above the sea level),\r\nand descended the eastern slope. The forest on the eastern side of\r\nthe mountain is still more magnificent than that on the west. From a\r\nclearing we obtained a fine view of the sea, the Island of Catanduanes,\r\nand the plain of Tabaco. [Prison as hotel.]  At sunset we reached Tibi,\r\nwhere I quartered myself in the prison. This, a tolerably clean place,\r\nenclosed with strong bamboos, was the most habitable part of a long\r\nshed which supplied the place of the tribunal destroyed in a storm two\r\nyears before. At Tibi I had an opportunity of sketching Mount Malinao\r\n(called also Buhi and Takit), which from this side has the appearance\r\nof a large volcano with a distinct crater. From the lake of Buhi it\r\nis not so clearly distinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Igabo hot spring.] Not far from Tibi, exactly north-east of Malinao,\r\nwe found a small hot spring called Igabo. In the middle of a plot of\r\nturf encircled by trees was a bare spot of oval form, nearly a hundred\r\npaces long and seventy wide. The whole space was covered with stones,\r\nrounded by attrition, as large as a man's head and larger. Here\r\nand there hot water bubbled out of the ground and discharged into a\r\nlittle brook; beside it some women were engaged in cooking their food,\r\nwhich they suspended in nets in the hottest parts of the water. On the\r\nlower surfaces of some of the stones a little sulphur was sublimated;\r\nof alum hardly a trace was perceptible. In a cavity some caolin had\r\naccumulated, and was used as a stain.\r\n\r\n[Naglegbeng silicious springs.] From here I visited the stalactite\r\nsprings, not far distant, of Naglegbeng. [105] I had expected to\r\nsee a calcareous fountain, but found the most magnificent masses of\r\nsilica of infinite variety of form; shallow cones with cylindrical\r\nsummits, pyramidal flights of steps, round basins with ribbed margins,\r\nand ponds of boiling water. One spot, denuded of trees, from two\r\nto three hundred paces in breadth and about five hundred in length,\r\nwas, with the exception of a few places overgrown with turf, covered\r\nwith a crust of silicious dross, which here and there formed large\r\nconnected areas, but was generally broken up into flaky plates by the\r\nvertical springs which pierced it. In numerous localities boiling\r\nhot mineral water containing silica was forcing itself out of the\r\nground, spreading itself over the surface and depositing a crust,\r\nthe thickness of which depended on its distance from the center\r\npoint. In this manner, in the course of time, a very flat cone is\r\nformed, with a basin of boiling water in the middle. The continuous\r\ndeposit of dross contracts the channel, and a less quantity of water\r\noverflows, while that close to the edge of the basin evaporates and\r\ndeposits a quantity of fine silicious earth; whence the upper portion\r\nof the cone not only is steeper than its base, but frequently assumes\r\na more cylindrical form, the external surface of which on account\r\nof the want of uniformity in the overflow, is ribbed in the form\r\nof stalactites. When the channel becomes so much obstructed that\r\nthe efflux is less than the evaporation, the water ceases to flow\r\nover the edge, and the mineral dross, during the continual cooling\r\nof the water, is then deposited, with the greatest uniformity, over\r\nthe inner area of the basin. When, however, the surface of the water\r\nsinks, this formation ceases at the upper portion of the basin; the\r\ninterior wall thickens; and, if the channel be completely stopped up\r\nand all the water evaporated, there remains a bell-shaped basin as\r\neven as if excavated by the hand of man. The water now seeks a fresh\r\noutlet, and bursts forth where it meets with the least obstruction,\r\nwithout destroying the beautiful cone it has already erected. Many such\r\nexamples exist. In the largest cones, however, the vapors generated\r\nacquire such power that, when the outlet is completely stopped up,\r\nthey break up the overlying crust in concentrically radiating flakes;\r\nand the water, issuing anew copiously from the center, deposits a fresh\r\ncrust, which again, by the process we have just described is broken\r\nup into a superimposed layer of flakes. In this manner are formed\r\nannular layers, which in turn are gradually covered by fresh deposits\r\nfrom the overflowing water. After the pyramid of layers is complete\r\nand the outlet stopped up, the water sometimes breaks forth on the\r\nslope of the same cone; a second cone is then formed near the first,\r\non the same base. In the vicinity of the silicious springs are seen\r\ndeposits of white, yellow, red, and bluish-grey clays, overlaying\r\none another in narrow strata-like variegated marl, manifestly the\r\ndisintegrated produce of volcanic rocks transported hither by rain\r\nand stained with oxide of iron. These clays perhaps come from the\r\nsame rocks from the disintegration of which the silicious earth has\r\nbeen formed. Similar examples occur in Iceland and in New Zealand;\r\nbut the products of the springs of Tibi are more varied, finer,\r\nand more beautiful than those of the Iceland Geysers.\r\n\r\n[A world wonder.] The wonderful conformations of the red cone are\r\nindeed astonishing, and hardly to be paralleled in any other quarter\r\nof the world. [106]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n[Quinali river.] On my second journey in Camarines, which I undertook\r\nin February, I went by water from Polangui, past Batu, as far as\r\nNaga. The Quinali, which runs into the south-eastern corner of the\r\nlake of Batu, runs out again on the north side as the Bicol River,\r\nand flows in a north-westerly direction as far as the Bay of San\r\nMiguel. It forms the medium of a not inconsiderable trade between Albay\r\nand Camarines, particularly in rice; of which the supply grown in the\r\nformer province does not suffice for the population, who consume the\r\nsuperfluity of Camarines. The rice is conveyed in large boats up the\r\nriver as far as Quinali, and thence transported further on in carabao\r\ncarts; and the boats return empty. During the dry season of the year,\r\nthe breadth of the very tortuous Bicol, at its mouth, is a little over\r\nsixty feet, and increases but very gradually. There is considerable\r\nvariety of vegetation upon its banks, and in animal life it is highly\r\nattractive. I was particularly struck with its numerous monkeys and\r\nwater-fowl. [Plotus water-fowl.] Of the latter the Plotus variety\r\nwas most abundant, but difficult to shoot. They sit motionless on\r\nthe trees on the bank, only their thin heads and necks, like those\r\nof tree-snakes, overtopping the leaves. On the approach of the boat\r\nthey precipitate themselves hastily into the water; and it is not\r\nuntil after many minutes that the thin neck is seen rising up again\r\nat some distance from the spot where the bird disappeared. The Plotus\r\nappears to be as rapid on the wing as it is in swimming and diving.\r\n\r\n[Naga.] In Naga, the chief city of South Camarines, I alighted at\r\nthe tribunal, from which, however, I was immediately invited by the\r\nprincipal official of the district--who is famed for his hospitality\r\nfar beyond the limits of his province--to his house, where I was loaded\r\nwith civilities and favors. This universally beloved gentleman put\r\neverybody under contribution in order to enrich my collections, and did\r\nall in his power to render my stay agreeable and to further my designs.\r\n\r\n[Nueva Caceres.] Naga is the seat of a bishopric and of the provincial\r\ngovernment. In official documents it is called Nueva Caceres, in\r\nhonor of the Captain-General, D. Fr. de Sande, a native of Caceres,\r\nwho about 1578 founded Naga (the Spanish town) close to the Filipino\r\nvillage. At the beginning of the seventeenth century it numbered\r\nnearly one hundred Spanish inhabitants; at the present time it hardly\r\nboasts a dozen. Murillo Velarde remarks (xiii, 272), in contrast\r\nto the state of things in America, that of all the towns founded in\r\nthe Philippines, with the exception of Manila, only the skeletons,\r\nthe names without the substance, have been preserved. The reason is,\r\nas has been frequently shown, that up to the present time plantations,\r\nand consequently proper settlers, have been wanting. Formerly Naga\r\nwas the principal town of the whole of that district of Luzon lying\r\nto the east of Tayabas, which, on account of the increased population,\r\nwas divided into the three provinces of North and South Camarines and\r\nAlbay. The boundaries of these governmental districts, those between\r\nAlbay and South Camarines more especially, have been drawn very\r\narbitrarily; although, the whole of the territory, as is shown by the\r\nmap, geographically is very well defined. [Land of the Bicols.] The\r\ncountry is named Camarines; but it might more suitably be called the\r\ncountry of the Bicols, for the whole of it is inhabited by one race,\r\nthe Bicol-Filipinos, who are distinguished by their speech and many\r\nother peculiarities from their neighbors, the Tagals on the west,\r\nand the Bisayans on the islands to the south and east.\r\n\r\n[The Bicols.] The Bicols are found only in this district and in a\r\nfew islands lying immediately in front of it. Of their coming hither\r\nno information is to be obtained from the comprehensive but confused\r\nhistories of the Spanish monks. Morga considers them to be natives\r\nof the island; on the other hand, it is asserted by tradition that\r\nthe inhabitants of Manila and its vicinity are descended from Malays\r\nwho have migrated thither, and from the inhabitants of other islands\r\nand more distant provinces. [107] Their speech is midway between\r\nthat of the Tagalogs and the Bisayans, and they themselves appear,\r\nin both their manners and customs, to be a half-breed between these\r\ntwo races. Physically and mentally they are inferior to the Tagalogs,\r\nand superior to the inhabitants of the eastern Bisayan Islands. [Bicol\r\nlanguage.] Bicol is spoken only in the two Camarines, Albay, Luzon,\r\nthe Islands of Masbate, Burias, Ticao, and Catanduanes, and in the\r\nsmaller adjoining islands. The inhabitants of the volcanic mountain\r\nIsarog and its immediate neighborhood speak it in the greatest\r\npurity. Thence towards the west the Bicol dialect becomes more and\r\nmore like Tagalog, and towards the east like Bisayan, until by degrees,\r\neven before reaching the boundaries of their ethnographical districts,\r\nit merges into these two kindred languages.\r\n\r\n[Rice cultivation.] In South Camarines the sowing of the rice in\r\nbeds begins in June or July, always at the commencement of the rainy\r\nseason; but in fields artificially watered, earlier, because thus the\r\nfruit ripens at a time when, the store in the country being small,\r\nits price is high. Although the rice fields could very well give two\r\ncrops yearly, they are tilled only once. It is planted out in August,\r\nwith intervals of a hand's-breadth between each row and each individual\r\nplant; and within four months the rice is ripe. The fields are never\r\nfertilized, and but seldom ploughed; the weeds and the stubble being\r\ngenerally trodden into the already soaked ground by a dozen carabaos,\r\nand the soil afterwards simply rolled with a cylinder furnished\r\nwith sharp points, or loosened with the harrow (sorod). Besides the\r\nagricultural implements named above, there are the Spanish hatchet\r\n(azadon) and a rake of bamboo (kag-kag) in use. The harvest is\r\neffected in a peculiar manner. The rice which is soonest ripe is\r\ncut for ten per cent, that is, the laborer receives for his toil the\r\ntenth bundle for himself. At this time of year rice is very scarce,\r\nwant is imminent, and labor reasonable. The more fields, however,\r\nthat ripen, the higher become the reapers' wages, rising to twenty,\r\nthirty, forty, even fifty per cent; indeed, the executive sometimes\r\nconsider it to be necessary to force the people to do harvest by\r\ncorporal punishment and imprisonment, in order to prevent a large\r\nportion of the crop from rotting on the stalk. Nevertheless, in very\r\nfruitful years a part of the harvest is lost. The rice is cut halm by\r\nhalm (as in Java) with a peculiarly-formed knife, or, failing such,\r\nwith the sharp-edged flap of a mussel [108] found in the ditches of\r\nthe rice-fields, which one has only to stoop to pick up.\r\n\r\n[Rice land production.] A quiñon of the best rice land is worth from\r\nsixty to one hundred dollars ($5.50 to $9 per acre). Rice fields on\r\nrising grounds are dearest, as they are not exposed to devastating\r\nfloods as are those in the plain, and may be treated so as to insure\r\nthe ripening of the fruit at the time when the highest price is to\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\n[The harvest.] A ganta of rice is sufficient to plant four topones\r\n(1 topon = 1 loan); from which 100 manojos (bundles) are gathered,\r\neach of which yields half a ganta of rice. The old ganta of Naga,\r\nhowever, being equal to a modern ganta and a half, the produce\r\nmay be calculated at 75 cavanes per quiñon, about 9 3/4 bushels per\r\nacre. [109] In books 250 cavanes are usually stated to be the average\r\nproduce of a quiñon; but that is an exaggeration. The fertility of\r\nthe fields certainly varies very much; but, when it is considered\r\nthat the land in the Philippines is never fertilized, but depends,\r\nfor the maintenance of its vitality, exclusively upon the overflowing\r\nof the mud which is washed down from the mountains, it may be believed\r\nthat the first numbers better express the true average. In Java the\r\nharvest, in many provinces, amounts to only 50 cavanes per quiñon;\r\nin some, indeed, to three times this amount; and in China, with the\r\nmost careful culture and abundant manure, to 180 cabanes.  [110]\r\n[Sweet potatoes.]  Besides rice, they cultivate the camote (sweet\r\npotato, Convolvulus batatas). This flourishes like a weed; indeed,\r\nit is sometimes planted for the purpose of eradicating the weeds from\r\nsoil intended for coffee or cacao. It spreads out into a thick carpet,\r\nand is an inexhaustible storehouse to its owner, who, the whole year\r\nthrough, can supply his wants from his field. Gabi (Caladium), Ubi\r\n(Dioscorea), maize, and other kinds of grain, are likewise cultivated.\r\n\r\n[Cattle and horses.] After the rice harvest the carabaos, horses, and\r\nbullocks, are allowed to graze in the fields. During the rice culture\r\nthey remain in the gogonales, cane-fields which arise in places once\r\ncultivated for mountain-rice and afterwards abandoned. (Gogo is the\r\nname of a cane 7 to 8 feet high, Saccharum sp.). Transport then is\r\nalmost impossible, because during the rainy season the roads are\r\nimpassable, and the cattle find nothing to eat. The native does\r\nnot feed his beast, but allows it to die when it cannot support\r\nitself. In the wet season of the year it frequently happens that a\r\ncarabao falls down from starvation whilst drawing a cart. A carabao\r\ncosts from $7 to $10; a horse $10 to $20; and a cow $6 to $8. Very fine\r\nhorses are valued at from $30 to $50, and occasionally as much as $80;\r\nbut the native horses are not esteemed in Manila, because they have no\r\nstamina. The bad water, the bad hay, and the great heat of the place at\r\nonce point out the reason; otherwise it would be profitable to export\r\nhorses in favorable seasons to Manila, where they would fetch twice\r\ntheir value. According to Morga, there were neither horses nor asses\r\non the Island until the Spaniards imported them from China and New\r\nSpain. [111] They were at first small and vicious. Horses were imported\r\nalso from Japan, \"not swift but powerful, with large heads and thick\r\nmanes, looking like Friesland horses;\" [112] and the breed improved\r\nrapidly. Those born in the country, mostly cross-breeds, drive well.\r\n\r\n[Black cattle.] Black cattle are generally in the hands of a few\r\nindividuals; some of whom in Camarines possess from 1000 to 3000 head;\r\nbut they are hardly saleable in the province, although they have been\r\nexported profitably for some years past to Manila. The black cattle\r\nof the province are small but make good beef. They are never employed\r\nfor labor, and the cows are not milked. The Filipinos, who generally\r\nfeed on fish, crabs, mussels, and wild herbs together with rice,\r\nprefer the flesh of the carabao to that of the ox; but they eat it\r\nonly on feastdays.\r\n\r\n[Sheep.] The old race of sheep, imported by the Spaniards previous\r\nto this century, still flourishes and is easily propagated. Those\r\noccasionally brought from Shanghai and Australia are considered to be\r\ndeficient in endurance, unfruitful, and generally short-lived. Mutton\r\nis procurable every day in Manila; in the interior, however, at\r\nleast in the eastern provinces, very rarely; although the rearing\r\nof sheep might there be carried on without difficulty, and in many\r\nplaces most profitably; the people being too idle to take care of the\r\nyoung lambs, which they complain are torn to pieces by the dogs when\r\nthey wander about free. The sheep appear to have been acclimatized\r\nwith difficulty. Morga says that they were brought several times\r\nfrom New Spain, but did not multiply; so that in his time this kind\r\nof domestic animal did not exist. [Swine.] Pork is eaten by wealthy\r\nEuropeans only when the hog has been brought up from the litter at\r\nhome. In order to prevent its wandering away, it is usually enclosed\r\nin a wide meshed cylindrical hamper of bamboo, upon filling which\r\nit is slaughtered. The native hogs are too nauseous for food, the\r\nanimals maintaining themselves almost entirely on ordure.\r\n\r\n[Guesses at history from language.] Crawfurd observes that the names\r\nof all the domestic animals in the Philippines belong to foreign\r\nlanguages, Those of the dog, swine, goat, carabao, cat, even of\r\nthe fowl and the duck, are Malay or Javanese; while those of the\r\nhorse, ox, and sheep, are Spanish. Until these animals were first\r\nimported from Malaysia, the aborigines were less fortunate in this\r\nrespect than the Americans, who at least had the alpaca, llamanda,\r\nvicuña. The names likewise of most of the cultivated plants, such as\r\nrice, yams, sugar-cane, cacao and indigo, are said to be Malay, as\r\nwell as those for silver, copper, and tin. Of the words relating to\r\ncommerce, one-third are Malay; to which belong most of the terms used\r\nin trades, as well as the denominations for weights and measures, for\r\nthe calendar--so far as it exists--and for numbers, besides the words\r\nfor writing, reading, speaking, and narrative. On the other hand, only\r\na small number of terms which refer to war are borrowed from the Malay.\r\n\r\n[Ancient Filipino civilization.] Referring to the degree of\r\ncivilization which the Philippines possessed previous to their\r\nintercourse with the Malays, Crawfurd concludes from the purely\r\ndomestic words that they cultivated no corn, their vegetable food\r\nconsisting of batata(?) and banana. They had not a single domestic\r\nanimal; they were acquainted with iron and gold, but with no other\r\nmetal, and were clothed in stuffs of cotton and alpaca, woven by\r\nthemselves. They had invented a peculiar phonetic alphabet; and their\r\nreligion consisted in the belief in good and evil spirits and witches,\r\nin circumcision, and in somewhat of divination by the stars. They\r\ntherefore were superior to the inhabitants of the South Sea, inasmuch\r\nas they possessed gold, iron, and woven fabrics, and inferior to them\r\nin that they had neither dog, pig, nor fowl.\r\n\r\n[Progress under Spain.] Assuming the truth of the above sketch of\r\npre-Christian culture, which has been put together only with the help\r\nof defective linguistic sources, and comparing it with the present, we\r\nfind, as the result, a considerable progress, for which the Philippines\r\nare indebted to the Spaniards. The influence of social relations has\r\nbeen already exhibited in the text. The Spaniards have imported the\r\nhorse, the bullock, and the sheep; maize, coffee, sugar-cane, cacao,\r\nsesame, tobacco, indigo, many fruits, and probably the batata, which\r\nthey met with in Mexico under the name of camotli. [113] From this\r\ncircumstance the term camote, universal in the Philippines, appears\r\nto have had its origin, Crawfurd, indeed, erroneously considering\r\nit a native term. According to a communication from Dr. Witmack, the\r\nopinion has lately been conceived that the batata is indigenous not\r\nonly to America, but also to the East Indies, as it has two names in\r\nSanscrit, sharkarakanda and ruktaloo.\r\n\r\n[Slight industrial progress.] With the exception of embroidery, the\r\nnatives have made but little progress in industries, in the weaving\r\nand the plaiting of mats; and the handicrafts are entirely carried\r\non by the Chinese.\r\n\r\n[Rice and abaca exported.] The exports consist of rice and abaca. The\r\nprovince exports about twice as much rice as it consumes; a large\r\nquantity to Albay, which, less adapted for the cultivation of rice,\r\nproduces only abaca; and a fair share to North Camarines, which is\r\nvery mountainous, and little fertile. The rice can hardly be shipped\r\nto Manila, as there is no high road to the south side of the province,\r\nnear to the principal town, and the transport by water from the north\r\nside, and from the whole of the eastern portion of Luzon, would\r\nimmediately enhance the price of the product. [Chinese monopolize\r\ntrade.]  The imports are confined to the little that is imported by\r\nChinese traders. The traders are almost all Chinese who alone possess\r\nshops in which clothing materials and woolen stuffs, partly of native\r\nand partly of European manufacture, women's embroidered slippers,\r\nand imitation jewelry, may be obtained. The whole amount of capital\r\ninvested in these shops certainly does not exceed $200,000. In the\r\nremaining pueblos of Camarines there are no Chinese merchants; and the\r\ninhabitants are consequently obliged to get their supplies from Naga.\r\n\r\n[Land for everybody.] The land belongs to the State, but is let to\r\nany one who will build upon it. The usufruct passes to the children,\r\nand ceases only when the land remains unemployed for two whole years;\r\nafter which it is competent for the executive to dispose of it to\r\nanother person.\r\n\r\n[Homes.] Every family possesses its own house; and the young husband\r\ngenerally builds with the assistance of his friends. In many places\r\nit does not cost more than four or five dollars, as he can, if\r\nnecessary, build it himself free of expense, with the simple aid of\r\nthe forest-knife (bolo), and of the materials to his hand, bamboo,\r\nSpanish cane, and palm-leaves. These houses, which are always built\r\non piles on account of the humidity of the soil, often consist of a\r\nsingle shed, which serves for all the uses of a dwelling, and are the\r\ncause of great laxity and of filthy habits, the whole family sleeping\r\ntherein in common, and every passer-by being a welcome guest. A fine\r\nhouse of boards for the family of a cabeza perhaps costs nearly $100;\r\nand the possessions of such a family in stock, furniture, ornaments,\r\netc. (of which they are obliged to furnish an annual inventory),\r\nwould range in value between $100 and $1,000. Some reach even as\r\nmuch as $10,000, while the richest family of the whole province is\r\nassessed at $40,000.\r\n\r\n[People not travellers.] In general it may be said that every pueblo\r\nsupplies travellers, its own necessaries, and produces little more. To\r\nthe indolent native, especially to him of the eastern provinces,\r\nthe village in which he was born is the world; and he leaves it only\r\nunder the most pressing circumstances. Were it otherwise even, the\r\nstrictness of the poll-tax would place great obstacles in the way of\r\ngratifying the desire for travel, generated by that oppressive impost.\r\n\r\n[Meals.] The Filipino eats three times a day--about 7 a.m., 12, and at\r\n7 or 8 in the evening. Those engaged in severe labor consume at each\r\nmeal a chupa of rice; the common people, half a chupa at breakfast, one\r\nat mid-day, and half again in the evening, altogether two chupas. Each\r\nfamily reaps its own supply of rice, and preserves it in barns, or\r\nbuys it winnowed at the market; in the latter case purchasing only\r\nthe quantity for one day or for the individual meals. The average\r\nretail price is 3 cuartos for 2 chupas (14 chupas for 1 real). To\r\nfree it from the husk, the quantity for each single meal is rubbed in\r\na mortar by the women. This is in accordance with an ancient custom;\r\nbut it is also due to the fear lest, otherwise, the store should be\r\ntoo quickly consumed. The rice, however, is but half cooked; and\r\nit would seem that this occurs in all places where it constitutes\r\nan essential part of the sustenance of the people, as may be seen,\r\nindeed, in Spain and Italy. Salt and much Spanish pepper (capsicum)\r\nare eaten as condiments; the latter, originally imported from America,\r\ngrowing all round the houses. To the common cooking-salt the natives\r\nprefer a so-called rock-salt, which they obtain by evaporation from\r\nsea-water previously filtered through ashes; and of which one chinanta\r\n(12 lbs. German) costs from one and one-half to two reals. The\r\nconsumption of salt is extremely small.\r\n\r\n[Buyo and cigars.] The luxuries of the Filipinos are buyo [114] and\r\ncigars--a cigar costing half a centavo, and a buyo much less. Cigars\r\nare rarely smoked, but are cut up into pieces, and chewed with the\r\nbuyo. The women also chew buyo and tobacco, but, as a rule, very\r\nmoderately; but they do not also stain their teeth black, like the\r\nMalays; and the young and pretty adorn themselves assiduously with\r\nveils made of the areca-nut tree, whose stiff and closely packed\r\nparallel fibers, when cut crosswise, form excellent tooth-brushes. They\r\nbathe several times daily, and surpass the majority of Europeans in\r\ncleanliness. Every native, above all things, keeps a fighting-cock;\r\neven when he has nothing to eat, he finds money for cock-fighting.\r\n\r\n[Household affairs.] The details of domestic economy may be summarized\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nFor cooking purposes an earthen pot is used, costing between 3 and 10\r\ncuartos; which, in cooking rice, is closed firmly with a banana-leaf,\r\nso that the steam of a very small quantity of water is sufficient. No\r\nother cooking utensils are used by the poorer classes; but those better\r\noff have a few cast-iron pans and dishes. In the smaller houses, the\r\nhearth consists of a portable earthen pan or a flat chest, frequently\r\nof an old cigar-* chest full of sand, with three stones which serve\r\nas a tripod. In the larger houses it is in the form of a bedstead,\r\nfilled with sand or ashes, instead of a mattress. The water in small\r\nhouseholds is carried and preserved in thick bamboos. In his bolo\r\n(forest-knife), moreover, every one has an universal instrument,\r\nwhich he carries in a wooden sheath made by himself, suspended by a\r\ncord of loosely-twisted bast fibers tied round his body. This, and\r\nthe rice-mortar (a block of wood with a suitable cavity), together\r\nwith pestles and a few baskets, constitute the whole of the household\r\n[Furniture.] furniture of a poor family; sometimes a large snail,\r\nwith a rush wick, is also to be found as a lamp. They sleep on a\r\nmat of pandanus (fan-palm, Corypha), when they possess one; if not,\r\non the splittings of bamboo, with which the house is floored. By the\r\npoor oil for lighting is rarely used; but torches of resin, which\r\nlast a couple of days, are bought in the market for half a cuarto.\r\n\r\n[Clothing.] Their clothing requirements I ascertained to be these:\r\nA woman wears a camisa de guinára (a short shift of abacá fiber),\r\na patadíon (a gown reaching from the hip to the ancles), a cloth,\r\nand a comb. A piece of guinára, costing 1 real, gives two shifts;\r\nthe coarsest patadíon costs 3 reals; a cloth, at the highest, 1 real;\r\nand a comb, 2 cuartos; making altogether 4 reals, 12 cuartos. Women of\r\nthe better class wear a camisa, costing between 1 and 2 r., a patadíon\r\n6 r., cloth between 2 and 3 r., and a comb 2 cu. The men wear a shirt,\r\n1 r., hose, 3 r., hat (tararura) of Spanish cane, 10 cu., or a salacot\r\n(a large rain-hat, frequently decorated), at least 2 r.--often,\r\nwhen ornamented with silver, as much as $50. At least three, but more\r\ncommonly four, suits are worn out yearly; the women, however, taking\r\ncare to weave almost the whole quantity for the family themselves.\r\n\r\n[Wages.] The daily wages of the common laborer are 1 real, without\r\nfood; and his hours of work are from 6 to 12, and from 2 to 6\r\no'clock. The women, as a rule, perform no field labor, but plant out\r\nthe rice and assist in the reaping; their wages on both occasions\r\nbeing equal to those of the men. Wood and stone-cutters receive 1.5\r\nr. per day, and calkers 1.75 r.\r\n\r\n[Land leases.] The Tercio is a pretty general contract in the\r\ncultivation of the land. The owner simply lets arable land for the\r\nthird part of the crop. Some mestizos possess several pieces of ground;\r\nbut they are seldom connected together, as they generally acquire\r\nthem as mortgages for sums bearing but a small proportion to their\r\nreal value.\r\n\r\n[Family income.] Under the head of earnings I give the income of a\r\nsmall family. The man earns daily one real, and the woman, if she\r\nweaves coarse stuff, one-fourth real, and her food (thus a piece\r\nof guinára, occupying the labor of two days, costs half a real in\r\nweavers' wages). The most skilful female weaver of the finer stuffs\r\nobtains twelve reals per piece; but it takes a month to weave; and\r\nthe month, on account of the numerous holy-days, must be calculated\r\nat the most as equal to twenty-four working days; she consequently\r\nearns one-fourth real per day and her food. For the knitting of the\r\nfibers of the ananas for the piña web (called sugot) she gets only\r\nan eighth of a real and her food.\r\n\r\n[Schools.] In all the pueblos there are schools. The schoolmaster\r\nis paid by the Government, and generally obtains two dollars per\r\nmonth, without board or lodging. In large pueblos the salary amounts\r\nto three dollars and a half; out of which an assistant must be\r\npaid. The schools are under the supervision of the ecclesiastics\r\nof the place. Reading and writing are taught, the writing copies\r\nbeing Spanish. The teacher, who has to teach his scholars Spanish\r\nexactly, does not understand it himself, while the Spanish officers,\r\non the other hand, do not understand the language of the country;\r\nand the priests have no inclination to alter this state of things,\r\nwhich is very useful to them as a means of influence. Almost the only\r\nFilipinos who speak Spanish are those who have been in the service\r\nof Europeans. A kind of religious horn-book is the first that is\r\nread in the language of the country (Bicol); and after that comes the\r\nChristian Doctrine, the reading-book called Casayayan. On an average,\r\nhalf of all the children go to school, generally from the seventh\r\nto the tenth year. They learn to read a little; a few even write a\r\nlittle: but they soon forget it again. Only those who are afterwards\r\nemployed as clerks write fluently; and of these most write well.\r\n\r\nSome priests do not permit boys and girls to attend the same school;\r\nand in this case they pay a second teacher, a female, a dollar a\r\nmonth. The Filipinos learn arithmetic very quickly, generally aiding\r\nthemselves by the use of mussels or stones, which they pile in little\r\nheaps before them and then count through.\r\n\r\n[Marriage age.] The women seldom marry before the fourteenth year,\r\ntwelve years being the legal limit. In the church-register of Polángui\r\nI found a marriage recorded (January, 1837) between a Filipino and a\r\nFilipina having the ominous name of Hilaria Concepción, who at the\r\ntime of the performance of the marriage ceremony was, according to\r\na note in the margin, only nine years and ten months old. Frequently\r\npeople live together unmarried, because they cannot pay the expenses\r\nof the ceremony. [115]\r\n\r\n[Woman's work.] European females, and even mestizas, never seek\r\nhusbands amongst the natives. The women generally are well treated,\r\ndoing only light work, such as sewing, weaving, embroidery, and\r\nmanaging the household; while all the heavy labor, with the exception\r\nof the beating of the rice, falls to the men. [116]\r\n\r\n[A patriarch.] Instances of longevity are frequent amongst the\r\nFilipinos, particularly in Camarines. The Diario de Manila, of\r\nMarch 13th, 1866, mentions an old man in Darága (Albay) whom I knew\r\nwell--Juan Jacob, born in 1744, married in 1764, and a widower\r\nin 1845. He held many public posts up to 1840, and had thirteen\r\nchildren, of whom five are living. He has one hundred and seventy\r\ndirect descendants, and now, at one hundred and twenty-two years of\r\nage, is still vigorous, with good eyes and teeth. Extreme unction\r\nwas administered to him seven times!\r\n\r\n[Snake bite and rabies remedy.] The first excretion of a new-born\r\nchild is carefully preserved, and under the name of triaca (theriacum)\r\nis held to be a highly efficacious and universal remedy for the bites\r\nof snakes and mad dogs. It is applied to the wound externally, and\r\nat the same time is taken internally.\r\n\r\n[Infant mortality.] A large number of children die in the first two\r\nweeks after birth. Statistical data are wanting; but, according to the\r\nopinion of one of the first physicians in Manila, at least one-fourth\r\ndie. This mortality must arise from great uncleanliness and impure air;\r\nsince in the chambers of the sick, and of women lying-in, the doors\r\nand windows are so closely shut that the healthy become sick from\r\nthe stench and heat, and the sick recover with difficulty. Every\r\naperture of the house is closed up by the husband early during\r\ntravail, in order that Patianac may not break in--an evil spirit\r\nwho brings mischief to lying-in women, and endeavors to hinder the\r\nbirth. The custom has been further maintained even amongst many\r\nwho attach no belief to the superstition, but who, from fear of a\r\ndraught of air through a hole, have discovered a new explanation for\r\nan old custom--namely, that instances of such practices occur amongst\r\nall people. [The itch.] One very widely-spread malady is the itch,\r\nalthough, according to the assurance of the physician above referred\r\nto, it may be easily subdued; and, according to the judgment of those\r\nwho are not physicians and who employ that term for any eruptions\r\nof the skin, the natives generally live on much too low a diet; the\r\nBicols even more than the Tagalogs. [117] Under certain conditions,\r\nwhich the physicians, on being questioned, could not define more\r\nprecisely, the natives can support neither hunger nor thirst; of which\r\nfact I have on many occasions been a witness. It is reported of them,\r\nwhen forced into such a situation as to suffer from unappeased wants,\r\nthat they become critically ill; and thus they often die.\r\n\r\n[Imitation mania.] Hence arises the morbid mania for imitation,\r\nwhich is called in Java Sakit-latar, and here Mali-mali. In Java many\r\nbelieve that the sickness is only assumed, because those who pretend\r\nto be afflicted with it find it to their advantage to be seen by newly\r\narrived Europeans. Here, however, I saw one instance where indeed no\r\nsimulation could be suspected. My companions availed themselves of\r\nthe diseased condition of a poor old woman who met us in the highway,\r\nto practice some rough jokes upon her. The old woman imitated every\r\nmotion as if impelled by an irresistible impulse, and expressed at\r\nthe same time the most extreme indignation against those who abused\r\nher infirmity.\r\n\r\n[The sickness in Siberia.] In R. Maak's \"Journey to the Amour,\" it is\r\nrecorded:--\"It is not unusual for the Maniagri to suffer also from a\r\nnervous malady of the most peculiar kind, with which we had already\r\nbeen made acquainted by the descriptions of several travellers. [118]\r\nThis malady is met with, for the most part, amongst the wild people\r\nof Siberia, as well as amongst the Russians settled there. In the\r\ndistrict of the Jakutes, where this affliction very frequently occurs,\r\nthose affected by it, both Russians and Jakutes, are known by the\r\nname of 'Emiura;' but here (that is, in that part of Siberia where\r\nthe Maniagri live) the same malady is called by the Maniagri 'Olon,'\r\nand by the Argurian Cossacks 'Olgandshi.' The attacks of the malady\r\nwhich I am now mentioning consist in this, that a man suffering\r\nfrom it will, if under the influence of terror or consternation,\r\nunconsciously, and often without the smallest sense of shame, imitate\r\neverything that passes before him. Should he be offended, he falls\r\ninto a rage, which manifests itself by wild shrieks and raving;\r\nand he precipitates himself at the same time, with a knife or any\r\nother object which may fall to his hand, upon those who have placed\r\nhim in this predicament. Amongst the Maniagri, women, especially the\r\nvery aged, are the chief sufferers from this malady; and instances,\r\nmoreover, of men who were affected by it are likewise known to me. It\r\nis worthy of remark that those women who returned home on account of\r\nthis sickness were notwithstanding strong, and in all other respects\r\nenjoyed good health.\"\r\n\r\n[Running amuck.] Probably it is only an accidental coincidence that\r\nin the Malay countries Sakit-latar and Amok exist together, if not in\r\nthe same individual, yet amongst the same people. Instances of Amok\r\nseem to occur also in the Philippines.  [119] I find the following\r\naccount in the Diario de Manila of February 21, 1866: In Cavite,\r\non February 18, a soldier rushed into the house of a school-teacher,\r\nand, struggling with him, stabbed him with a dagger, and then killed\r\nthe teacher's son with a second stab. Plunging into the street, he\r\nstabbed two young girls of ten and twelve years of age and wounded a\r\nwoman in the side, a boy aged nine in the arm, a coachman (mortally) in\r\nthe abdomen, and, besides another woman, a sailor and three soldiers;\r\nand arriving at his barracks, where he was stopped by the sentry,\r\nhe plunged the dagger into his own breast.\r\n\r\n[Regard for the sleeping.] It is one of the greatest insults to stride\r\nover a sleeping native, or to awaken him suddenly. They rouse one\r\nanother, when necessity requires, with the greatest circumspection\r\nand by the slowest degrees. [120]\r\n\r\n[Sense of smell.] The sense of smell is developed amongst the\r\nnatives to so great a degree that they are able, by smelling at the\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, to tell to which persons they belong (\"Reisesk.,\"\r\np. 39); and lovers at parting exchange pieces of the linen they may\r\nbe wearing, and during their separation inhale the odor of the beloved\r\nbeing, besides smothering the relics with kisses. [121]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\n[A scientific priest-poet.] From Naga I visited the parish priest\r\nof Libmanan (Ligmanan), who, possessing poetical talent, and having\r\nthe reputation of a natural philosopher, collected and named pretty\r\nbeetles and shells, and dedicated the most elegant little sonnets. He\r\nfavored me with the following narrative:--\r\n\r\n[Prehistoric remains] In 1851, during the construction of a road a\r\nlittle beyond Libmanan, at a place called Poro, a bed of shells was\r\ndug up under four feet of mould, one hundred feet distant from the\r\nriver. It consisted of Cyrenae (C. suborbicularis, Busch.), a species\r\nof bivalve belonging to the family of Cyclades which occurs only in\r\nwarm waters, and is extraordinarily abundant in the brackish waters of\r\nthe Philippines. On the same occasion, at the depth of from one and\r\na half to three and a half feet, were found numerous remains of the\r\nearly inhabitants--skulls, ribs, bones of men and animals, a child's\r\nthighbone inserted in a spiral of brass wire, several stags' horns,\r\nbeautifully-formed dishes and vessels, some of them painted, probably\r\nof Chinese origin; striped bracelets, of a soft, gypseous, copper-red\r\nrock, gleaming as if they were varnished; [122] small copper knives,\r\nbut no iron utensils; and several broad flat stones bored through\r\nthe middle; [123] besides a wedge of petrified wood, embedded in a\r\ncleft branch of a tree. The place, which to this day may be easily\r\nrecognized in a hollow, might, by excavation systematically carried on,\r\nyield many more interesting results. What was not immediately useful\r\nwas then and there destroyed, and the remainder dispersed. In spite of\r\nevery endeavor, I could obtain, through the kindness of Señor Fociños\r\nin Naga, only one small vessel. Similar remains of more primitive\r\ninhabitants have been found at the mouth of the Bigajo, not far from\r\nLibmánan, in a shell-bed of the same kind; and an urn, with a human\r\nskeleton, was found at the mouth of the Perlos, west of Sitio de Poro,\r\nin 1840. At the time when I wrote down these statements of the priest,\r\nneither of us was familiar with the discoveries made within the last\r\nfew years relating to the lake dwellings (pile villages); or these\r\nnotes might have been more exact, although probably they would not\r\nhave been so easy and natural.\r\n\r\n[Ancient Chinese jar.] Mr. W. A. Franks, who had the kindness to\r\nexamine the vessel, inclines to the opinion that it is Chinese, and\r\npronounces it to be of very great antiquity, without however, being\r\nable to determine its age more exactly; and a learned Chinese of the\r\nBurlingame Embassy expressed himself to the same effect. He knew only\r\nof one article, now in the British Museum, which was brought from Japan\r\nby Kaempfer, the color, glazing, and cracks in the glazing, of which\r\n(craqueles) corresponded precisely with mine. According to Kaempfer,\r\nthe Japanese found similar vessels in the sea; and they value them\r\nvery highly for the purpose of preserving their tea in them.\r\n\r\nMorga writes:--\r\n\r\n[Used as tea canisters.]  \"On this island, Luzon, particularly in\r\nthe provinces of Manila, Pampánga, Pangasinán, and Ilócos, very\r\nancient clay vessels of a dark brown color are found by the natives,\r\nof a sorry appearance; some of a middling size, and others smaller;\r\nmarked with characters and stamps. They are unable to say either when\r\nor where they obtained them; but they are no longer to be acquired, nor\r\nare they manufactured in the islands. The Japanese prize them highly,\r\nfor they have found that the root of a herb which they call Tscha\r\n(tea), and which when drunk hot is considered as a great delicacy\r\nand of medicinal efficacy by the kings and lords in Japan, cannot be\r\neffectively preserved except in these vessels; which are so highly\r\nesteemed all over Japan that they form the most costly articles of\r\ntheir show-rooms and cabinets. Indeed, so highly do they value them\r\nthat they overlay them externally with fine gold embossed with great\r\nskill, and enclose them in cases of brocade; and some of these vessels\r\nare valued at and fetch from two thousand tael to eleven reals. The\r\nnatives of these islands purchase them from the Japanese at very high\r\nrates, and take much pains in the search for them on account of their\r\nvalue, though but few are now found on account of the eagerness with\r\nwhich they have been sought for.\"\r\n\r\n[Strict search in Japan.] When Carletti, in 1597, went from the\r\nPhilippines to Japan, all the passengers on board were examined\r\ncarefully, by order of the governor, and threatened with capital\r\npunishment if they endeavored to conceal \"certain earthen vessels\r\nwhich were wont to be brought from the Philippines and other islands\r\nof that sea,\" as the king wished to buy them all.\r\n\r\n[Prized by Japanese.] \"These vessels were worth as much as five,\r\nsix, and even ten thousand scudi each; but they were not permitted\r\nto demand for them more then one Giulio (about a half Paolo).\" In\r\n1615 Carletti met with a Franciscan who was sent as ambassador from\r\nJapan to Rome, who assured him that he had seen one hundred and\r\nthirty thousand scudi paid by the King of Japan for such a vessel;\r\nand his companions confirmed the statement. Carletti also alleges,\r\nas the reason for the high price, \"that the leaf cia or tea, the\r\nquality of which improves with age, is preserved better in those\r\nvessels than in all others. The Japanese besides know these vessels by\r\ncertain characters and stamps. They are of great age and very rare,\r\nand come only from Cambodia, Siam, Cochin-China, the Philippines,\r\nand other neighboring islands. From their external appearance they\r\nwould be estimated at three or four quatrini (two dreier).... It is\r\nperfectly true that the king and the princes of that kingdom possess\r\na very large number of these vessels, and prize them as their most\r\nvaluable treasure and above all other rarities .... and that they boast\r\nof their acquisitions, and from motives of vanity strive to outvie one\r\nanother in the multitude of pretty vessels which they possess. [124]\r\n\r\n[Found in Borneo.] Many travellers mention vessels found likewise\r\namongst the Dyaks and the Malays in Borneo, which, from superstitious\r\nmotives, were estimated at most exaggerated figures, amounting\r\nsometimes to many thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n[$3,500 for a jar] St. John [125] relates that the Datu of Tamparuli\r\n(Borneo) gave rice to the value of almost $3,500 for a jar, and that he\r\npossessed a second jar of almost fabulous value, which was about two\r\nfeet high, and of a dark olive green. The Datu fills both jars with\r\nwater, which, after adding plants and flowers to it, he dispenses\r\n[A speaking jar.] to all the sick persons in the country. But the\r\nmost famous jar in Borneo is that of the Sultan of Brunei, which\r\nnot only possesses all the valuable properties of the other jars\r\nbut can also speak. St. John did not see it, as it is always kept\r\nin the women's apartment; but the sultan, a credible man, related to\r\nhim that the jar howled dolefully the night before the death of his\r\nfirst wife, and that it emitted similar tones in the event of impending\r\nmisfortunes. St. John is inclined to explain the mysterious phenomenon\r\nby a probably peculiar form of the mouth of the vessel, in passing over\r\nwhich the air-draught is thrown into resonant verberations, like the\r\nAeolian harp. The vessel is generally enveloped in gold brocade, and\r\nis uncovered only when it is to be consulted; and hence, of course,\r\nit happens that it speaks only on solemn occasions. St. John states\r\nfurther that the Bisayans used formerly to bring presents to the\r\nsultan; in recognition of which they received some water from the\r\nsacred jar to sprinkle over their fields and thereby ensure plentiful\r\nharvests. When the sultan was asked whether he would sell his jar for\r\n$100,000, he answered that no offer in the world could tempt him to\r\npart with it.\r\n\r\n[Morga's description.] Morga's description suits neither the vessel\r\nof Libmánan nor the jar of the British Museum, but rather a vessel\r\nbrought from Japan a short time ago to our Ethnographical Museum. This\r\nis of brown clay, small but of graceful shape, and composed of many\r\npieces cemented together; the joints being gilt and forming a kind of\r\nnetwork on the dark ground. How highly ancient pots of a similar kind,\r\neven of native origin, are esteemed in Japan down to the present day,\r\nis shown by the following certificate translated by the interpreter\r\nof the German Consulate:--\r\n\r\n[A consecrated jar.] \"This earthen vessel was found in the porcelain\r\nfactory of Tschisuka in the province of Odori, in South Idzumi,\r\nand is an object belonging to the thousand graves.... It was made\r\nby Giogiboosat (a celebrated Buddhist priest), and after it had been\r\nconsecrated to heaven was buried by him. According to the traditions\r\nof the people, this place held grave mounds with memorial stones. That\r\nis more than a thousand years ago. ....In the pursuit of my studies,\r\nI remained many years in the temple Sookuk, of that village, and\r\nfound the vessel. I carried it to the high priest Shakudjo, who\r\nwas much delighted therewith and always bore it about with him as\r\na treasure. When he died it fell to me, although I could not find\r\nit. Recently, when Honkai was chief priest, I saw it again, and\r\nit was as if I had again met the spirit of Shakudjo. Great was my\r\ncommotion, and I clapped my hands with astonishment; and, as often\r\nas I look upon the treasure, I think it is a sign that the spirit of\r\nShakudjo is returned to life. Therefore I have written the history,\r\nand taken care, of this treasure.--Fudji Kuz Dodjin.\"\r\n\r\nBaron Alexander von Siebold communicates the following:--\r\n\r\n[Tea societies.] The value which the Japanese attach to vessels of this\r\nkind rests upon the use which is made of them by the mysterious tea\r\nsocieties called Cha-no-yu. Respecting the origin of these societies,\r\nwhich still are almost entirely unknown to Europeans, different legends\r\nexist. They flourished, however, principally during the reign of the\r\nemperor Taikosama, who, in the year 1588, furnished the society of\r\nCha-no-yu at Kitano near Myako with new laws. In consequence of the\r\nreligious and civil wars, the whole of the people had deteriorated\r\nand become ungovernable, having lost all taste for art and knowledge,\r\nand holding only rude force in any esteem; brute strength ruling in the\r\nplace of the laws. The observant Taikosama perceived that, in order to\r\ntame these rough natures, he must accustom them to the arts of peace,\r\nand thus secure prosperity to the country, and safety for himself and\r\nhis successors. With this in view he recalled the Cha-no-yu society\r\nanew into life, and assembled its masters and those acquainted with\r\nits customs around him.\r\n\r\n[Their object.] The object of the Cha-no-yu is to draw man away\r\nfrom the influences of the terrestrial forces which surround him,\r\nto plant within him the feeling of complete repose, and to dispose\r\nhim to self-contemplation. All the exercises of the Cha-no-yu are\r\ndirected to this object.\r\n\r\n[Ceremonies.] Clothed in light white garments, and without weapons,\r\nthe members of the Cha-no-yu assemble round the master's house, and,\r\nafter resting some time in the ante-room, are conducted into a pavilion\r\nappropriated exclusively to these assemblies. This consists of the\r\nmost costly kinds of wood, but is without any ornament which could\r\npossibly be abstracted from it; without color, and without varnish,\r\ndimly lighted by small windows thickly overgrown with plants, and\r\nso low that it is impossible to stand upright. The guests tread the\r\napartment with solemn measured steps, and, having been received by\r\nhim according to the prescribed formulas, arrange themselves in\r\na half-circle on both sides of him. All distinctions of rank are\r\nabolished. The ancient vessels are now removed with solemn ceremonies\r\nfrom their wrappings, saluted and admired; and, with the same solemn\r\nand rigidly prescribed formulas, the water is heated on the hearth\r\nappropriated to the purpose, and the tea taken from the vessels and\r\nprepared in cups. The tea consists of the young green leaves of the\r\ntea-shrub rubbed to powder, and is very stimulating in its effect. The\r\nbeverage is taken amidst deep silence, while incense is burning on\r\nthe elevated pedestal of honor, toko; and, after the thoughts have\r\nthus been collected, conversation begins. It is confined to abstract\r\nsubjects; but politics are not always excluded.\r\n\r\n[Reward of valor.] The value of the vessels employed in these\r\nassemblages is very considerable; indeed, they do not fall short of the\r\nvalue of our most costly paintings; and Taikosama often rewarded his\r\ngenerals with vessels of the kind, instead of land, as was formerly the\r\npractice. After the last revolution some of the more eminent Daimios\r\n(princes) of the Mikado were rewarded with similar Cha-no-yu vessels,\r\nin acknowledgment of the aid rendered to him in regaining the throne\r\nof his ancestors. The best of them which I have seen were far from\r\nbeautiful, simply being old, weather-worn, black or dark-brown jars,\r\nwith pretty broad necks, for storing the tea in; tall cups of cracked\r\nCraquelé, either porcelain or earthenware, for drinking the infusion;\r\nand deep, broad cisterns; besides rusty old iron kettles with rings,\r\nfor heating the water: but they were enwrapped in the most costly\r\nsilken stuffs, and preserved in chests lacquered with gold. Similar\r\nold vessels are preserved amongst the treasures of the Mikado and the\r\nTycoon, as well as in some of the temples, with all the care due to the\r\nmost costly jewels, together with documents relating to their history.\r\n\r\n[Yamtik and Visita Bicul.]  From Libmánan I visited the mountain,\r\nYamtik (Amtik, Hantu), [126] which consists of lime, and contains\r\nmany caverns. Six hours westward by water, and one hour S.S.W. on\r\nfoot, brought us to the Visita Bícul, surrounded by a thousand little\r\nlimestone hills; from which we ascended by a staircase of sinter in the\r\nbed of a brook, to a small cavern tenanted by multitudes of bats, and\r\ngreat long-armed spiders of the species Phrynus, known to be poisonous.\r\n[127]\r\n\r\n[Ant activities.] A thick branch of a tree lying across the road was\r\nperforated from end to end by a small ant. Many of the natives did\r\nnot venture to enter the cave; and those who did enter it were in a\r\nstate of great agitation, and were careful first to enjoin upon each\r\nother the respect to be observed by them towards Calapnitan.  [128]\r\n\r\n[Superstitions.] One of the principal rules was to name no object in\r\nthe cave without adding \"Lord Calapnitan's.\" Thus they did not bluntly\r\nrefer to either gun or torch, but devoutly said \"Lord C.'s gun,\" or\r\n\"Lord C.'s torch.\" At a thousand paces from this lies another cave,\r\n\"San Vicente,\" which contains the same insects, but another kind\r\nof bat. Both caves are only of small extent; but in Libmánan a very\r\nlarge stalactite cave was mentioned to me, the description of which,\r\nnotwithstanding the fables mixed up with it, could not but have a true\r\nfoundation. Our guides feigned ignorance of it; and it was not till\r\nafter two days' wandering about, and after many debates, that they came\r\nto the decision, since I adhered to my purpose, to encounter the risk;\r\nwhen, to my great astonishment, they conducted me back to Calapnitan's\r\ncave; from which a narrow fissure, hidden by a projection of rock,\r\nled into one of the most gorgeous stalactite caves in the world. Its\r\nfloor was everywhere firm and easy to the tread, and mostly dry; and\r\nit ran out into several branches, the entire length of which probably\r\nexceeds a mile; and the whole series of royal chambers and cathedrals,\r\nwith the columns, pulpits, and altars which it contained, reflected\r\nno discredit upon its description. No bones or other remains were to\r\nbe found in it. My intention to return subsequently with laborers,\r\nfor the purpose of systematic excavation, was not carried out.\r\n\r\n[Unsuccessful climb.] I was not lucky enough to reach the summit of the\r\nmountain, upon which was to be found a lake, \"from where else should\r\nthe water come?\" For two days we labored strenuously at different\r\npoints to penetrate the thick forest; but the guide, who had assured\r\nthe priest in Libmanan that he knew the road, now expressed himself\r\nto the contrary effect. I therefore made the fellow, who had hitherto\r\nbeen unburdened, now carry a part of the baggage as a punishment;\r\nbut he threw it off at the next turning of the road and escaped,\r\nso that we were compelled to return. Stags and wild boars are very\r\nnumerous in these forests; and they formed the principal portion of\r\nour meals, at which, at the commencement of our expedition, we had\r\nas many as thirty individuals; who, in the intervals between them,\r\naffected to search for snails and insects for me, but with success\r\nnot proportionate to their zeal.\r\n\r\n[A clever pilfering servant.] Upon my departure from Daraga I took\r\nwith me a lively little boy, who had a taste for the calling of a\r\nnaturalist. In Libmanan he was suddenly lost, and with him, at the\r\nsame time, a bundle of keys; and we looked for him in vain. The\r\nfact was, as I afterwards came to learn, that he went straight to\r\nNaga, and, identifying himself by showing the stolen keys, got the\r\nmajordomo of my host to deliver to him a white felt hat; with which he\r\ndisappeared. I had once seen him, with the hat on his head, standing\r\nbefore a looking-glass and admiring himself; and he could not resist\r\nthe temptation to steal it.\r\n\r\n[Trip with Internal Revenue Collector.] In the beginning of March\r\nI had the pleasure of accompanying the Collector (Administrador) of\r\nCamarines and a Spanish head-man, who were travelling across Daet and\r\nMauban to the chief town. At five p.m. we left Butungan on the Bicol\r\nRiver, two leagues below Naga, in a falúa of twelve oars, equipped\r\nwith one 6-pounder and two 4-pounders, and reinforced by armed men;\r\nand about six we reached Cabusao, at the mouth of the Bicol, whence we\r\nput to sea about nine. The falua belonged to the collector of taxes,\r\nand had, in conjunction with another under the command of the alcalde,\r\nto protect the north coast of the province against smugglers and\r\npirates, who at this time of the year are accustomed to frequent\r\nthe hiding-places of the bay of San Miguel. Two similar gun-boats\r\nperformed the duty on the south coast of the province.\r\n\r\n[Four volcanos.] Both the banks of the Bicol River are flat, and\r\nexpand into broad fields of rice; and to the east are simultaneously\r\nvisible the beautiful volcanos of Mayon, Iriga, Malina, and Isarog.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak we reached the bar of Daet, and, after two hours'\r\ntravelling, the similarly named chief city of the province of North\r\nCamarines, where we found an excellent reception at the house of\r\nthe alcalde, a polished Navarrese; marred only by the tame monkey,\r\nwho should have welcomed the guests of his master, turning his\r\nback towards them with studiously discourteous gestures, and going\r\ntowards the door. However, upon the majordomo placing a spirit flask\r\npreserving a small harmless snake on the threshold, the monkey sprang\r\nquickly back and concealed himself, trembling, behind his master. [A\r\ndanceless ball.] In the evening there was a ball, but there were no\r\ndancers present. Some Filipinas, who had been invited, sat bashfully\r\nat one end of the apartment and danced with one another when called\r\nupon, without being noticed by the Spaniards, who conversed together\r\nat the other end.\r\n\r\n[Spanish prejudice against bathing.] Our departure hence was delayed\r\nby festivities and sudden showers for about two days, after which the\r\nspirited horses of the alcalde carried us within an hour on a level\r\nroad north-west, to Talisáy, and in another hour to Indang, where\r\na bath and breakfast were ready. Up to this time I had never seen\r\na bath-room in the house of a Spaniard; whereas with the Northern\r\nEuropeans it is never wanting. The Spaniards appear to regard\r\nthe bath as a species of medicine, to be used only with caution;\r\nmany, even to the present day, look upon it as an institution not\r\nquite Christian. At the time of the Inquisition frequent bathing,\r\nit is known, was a characteristic of the Moors, and certainly was not\r\nwholly free from danger. In Manila, only those who live near the Pasig\r\nare the exceptions to the rule; and there the good or bad practice\r\nprevails of whole families bathing, in the company of their friends,\r\nin the open air.\r\n\r\n[An unfortified fort.] The road ends at Indáng. In two boats we went\r\ndown the river till stopped by a bar, and there at a well-supplied\r\ntable prepared for us by the kindness of the alcalde we awaited\r\nthe horses which were being brought thither along a bad road by our\r\nservants. In the waste of Barre a tower, surrounded by two or three\r\nfishermen's huts and as many camarines, has been erected against the\r\nMoros, who, untempted by the same, seldom go so far westward, for\r\nit consists only of an open hut covered with palm-leaves--a kind of\r\nparasol--supported on stakes as thick as one's arm and fifteen feet\r\nhigh; and the two cannons belonging to it ought, for security, to be\r\nburied. We followed the sea-shore, which is composed of silicious sand,\r\nand covered with a carpet of creeping shore plants in full bloom. On\r\nthe edge of the wood, to the left, were many flowering shrubs and\r\npandanus with large scarlet-red flowers. After an hour we crossed the\r\nriver Longos in a ferry, and soon came to the spur of a crystalline\r\nchain of mountains, which barred our road and extended itself into\r\nthe sea as Point Longos. The horses climbed it with difficulty, and\r\nwe found the stream on the other side already risen so high that we\r\nrode knee-deep in the water. After sunset we crossed singly, with\r\ngreat loss of time, in a miserable ferry-boat, over the broad mouth\r\nof the Pulundaga, where a pleasant road through a forest led us,\r\nin fifteen minutes, over the mountain-spur, Malanguit, which again\r\nprojected itself right across our path into the sea, to the mouth\r\nof the Paracale. The long bridge here was so rotten that we were\r\nobliged to lead the horses over at wide intervals apart; and on the\r\nfurther side lies the place called Paracale, from which my companions\r\ncontinued their journey across Mauban to Manila.\r\n\r\n[Red lead.] Paracale and Mambulao are two localities well known to\r\nall mineralogists, from the red lead ore occurring there. On the\r\nfollowing morning I returned to Longos; which consists of only a few\r\nmiserable huts inhabited by gold-washers, who go about almost naked,\r\nprobably because they are laboring during the greater part of the\r\nday in the water; but they are also very poor.\r\n\r\n[Gold mining.] The soil is composed of rubbish, decomposed fragments of\r\ncrystalline rock, rich in broken pieces of quartz. The workmen make\r\nholes in the ground two and one-half feet long, two and one-half\r\nbroad, and to thirty feet deep. At three feet below the surface\r\nthe rock is generally found to contain gold, the value increasing\r\ndown to eighteen feet of depth, and then again diminishing, though\r\nthese proportions are very uncertain, and there is much fruitless\r\nsearch. The rock is carried out of the holes in baskets, on ladders\r\nof bamboo, and the water in small pails; but in the rainy season the\r\nholes cannot possibly be kept free from water, as they are situated\r\non the slope of the mountain, and are filled quicker than they can\r\nbe emptied. The want of apparatus for discharging water also accounts\r\nfor the fact that the pits are not dug deeper.\r\n\r\n[A primitive rock breaker.] The breaking of the auriferous rock is\r\neffected with two stones; of which one serves as anvil, and the other\r\nas hammer. The former, which is slightly hollowed in the center, is\r\nlaid flat upon the ground; and the latter, four by eight by eight\r\ninches in dimensions, and therefore of about twenty-five pounds\r\nweight, is made fast with rattan to the top of a slender young tree,\r\nwhich lies in a sloping position in a fork, and at its opposite end is\r\nfirmly fixed in the ground. The workman with a jerk forces the stone\r\nthat serves for hammer down upon the auriferous rock, and allows it\r\nto be again carried upwards by the elasticity of the young tree.\r\n\r\n[An arrastre.] The crushing of the broken rock is effected with\r\nan apparatus equally crude. A thick stake rises from the center\r\nof a circular support of rough-hewn stones (which is enclosed in\r\na circle of exactly similar stones) having an iron pin at its top,\r\nto which a tree, bent horizontally in the middle, and downwards at\r\nthe two ends, is fixed. Being set in motion by two carabaos attached\r\nin front, it drags several heavy stones, which are bound firmly to\r\nit with rattans, round the circle, and in this manner crushes the\r\nbroken rock, which has been previously mixed with water, to a fine\r\nmud. The same apparatus is employed by the Mexican gold-washers,\r\nunder the name of Rastra. [Gold-washing.] The washing-out of the mud\r\nis done by women. They kneel before a small wooden gutter filled with\r\nwater up to the brim, and provided with boards, sloping downwards,\r\nin front of the space assigned to each woman; the gutter being cut\r\nout at these places in a corresponding manner, so that a very slender\r\nstream of water flows evenly across its whole breadth downwards over\r\nthe board. With her hand the work-woman distributes the auriferous\r\nmud over the board, which, at the lower edge, is provided with a\r\ncross-piece; and, when the light sand is washed away, there remains a\r\nstratum consisting chiefly of iron, flint, and ore, which is taken up\r\nfrom time to time with a flat piece of board, and laid on one side;\r\nand at the end of the day's work, it is washed out in a flat wooden\r\ndish (batea), and, for the last time, in a coco-shell; when, if they\r\nare lucky, a fine yellow dust shows itself on the edge. [129] During\r\nthe last washing the slimy juice of the Gogo is added to the water,\r\nthe fine heavy sand remaining suspended therein for a longer time\r\nthan in pure water, and thus being more easily separated from the\r\ngold-dust. [130]\r\n\r\n[The clean-up.] It is further to be mentioned that the refuse from\r\nthe pits is washed at the upper end of the water-gutter, so that\r\nthe sand adhering to the stones intended for pounding may deposit\r\nits gold in the gutter or on the washing-board. In order to melt\r\nthe gold thus obtained into a lump, in which form it is bought by\r\nthe dealers, it is poured into a small heart-shell (cardium), and,\r\nafter being covered with a handful of charcoal, placed  in a potsherd;\r\nwhen a woman blows through a narrow bamboo-cane on the kindled coals,\r\nand in one minute the work is completed. [131]\r\n\r\nThe result of many inquiries shows the profit per head to average\r\nnot more than one and one-half reals daily. Further to the south-west\r\nfrom here, on the mountain Malaguit, are seen the ruins of a Spanish\r\nmining company; a heap of rubbish, a pit fifty feet deep, a large\r\nhouse fallen to ruin, and a stream-work four feet broad and six feet\r\nhigh. The mountain consists of gneiss much decomposed, with quartz\r\nveins in the stream-work, with the exception of the bands of quartz,\r\nwhich are of almost pure clay earth with sand.\r\n\r\n[Edible bird's nests.] On the sides hung some edible nests of the\r\nsalangane, but not of the same kind as those found in the caverns\r\non the south coast of Java. These, which are of much less value than\r\nthe latter, are only occasionally collected by the Chinese dealers,\r\nwho reckon them nominally at five cents each. We also found a few of\r\nthe nest-building birds (Collocalia troglodytes, Gray). [132]\r\n\r\n[Abandoned workings.] Around lay so large a number of workings,\r\nand there were so many little abandoned pits, wholly or half fallen\r\nto ruin, and more or less grown over, that it was necessary to step\r\nbetween with great caution. Some of them were still being worked after\r\nthe mode followed at Lóngos, but with a few slight improvements. The\r\npits are twice as large as those excavated there, and the rock is\r\nlifted, up by a pulley to a cylindrical framework of bamboo, which\r\nis worked by the feet of a lad who sits on a bank higher up.\r\n\r\n[Lead and mica.] Ten minutes north of the village of Malaguit is\r\na mountain in which lead-glance and red lead have been obtained;\r\nthe rock consisting of micaceous gneiss much decomposed. There is\r\na stream-work over one hundred feet in length. The rock appears to\r\nhave been very poor.\r\n\r\nThe highly prized red-lead ores have been found on the top of this same\r\nhill, N. 30° W. from the village. The quarry was fallen to ruin and\r\nflooded with rain, so that only a shallow hollow in the ground remained\r\nvisible; and after a long search amongst the bushes growing there a few\r\nsmall fragments were found, on which [Chrome-lead ore.] chrome-lead\r\nore was still clearly to be recognized. Captain Sabino, the former\r\ngovernor of Paracale, a well-informed Filipino, who, at the suggestion\r\nof the alcalde, accompanied me, had for some years caused excavations\r\nto be carried on, in order to find specimens for a speculator who had\r\nin view the establishment of a new mining company in Spain; but the\r\nspecimens which were found had not been removed, as speculation in\r\nmines in the Philippines had, in the interval, fallen into discredit\r\non the Exchange of Madrid; and as yet only a little box full of sand,\r\nout of a few small drusy cavities, has been fixed upon and pounded,\r\nto be sold as variegated writing-sand, after being carefully sifted.\r\n\r\n[A pretty fan-palm.] A peculiarly beautiful fan-palm grows on this\r\nhill. Its stem is from thirty to forty feet high, cylindrical and\r\ndark-brown, with white rings a quarter of an inch broad at distances of\r\nfour inches, and, at similar intervals, crown-shaped bands of thorns\r\ntwo inches long. Near the crown-leaf the stem passes into the richest\r\nbrown of burnt sienna.\r\n\r\n[Rooming in a powder-magazine.] Notwithstanding a very bad road, a\r\npleasant ride carried us from Paracale to the sea-shore, and, through\r\na beautiful wood, to Mambulao, which lies W. by N. I alighted at the\r\ntribunal, and took up my lodgings in the room where the ammunition was\r\nkept, as being the only one that could be locked. For greater security,\r\nthe powder was stored in a corner and covered with carabao-hide;\r\nbut such were my arrangements that my servant carried about a burning\r\ntallow light, and his assistant a torch in the hand. When I visited\r\nthe Filipino priest, I was received in a friendly manner by a young\r\ngirl who, when I offered my hand, thanked me with a bow, saying,\r\n\"Tengo las sarnas\" (\"I have the itch\"). The malady, which is very\r\ncommon in the Philippines, appears to have its focus in this locality.\r\n\r\n[Gneiss and crystalline rock.] A quarter of a league N.N.E. we came\r\nupon the ruins of another mining undertaking, the Ancla de Oro. Shaft\r\nand water-cutting had fallen in, and were thickly grown over; and\r\nonly a few of the considerable buildings were still standing; and\r\neven those were ready to fall. In a circle some natives were busily\r\nemployed, in their manner, collecting grains of gold. The rock is\r\ngneiss, weathered so much that it cannot be recognized; and at a\r\nthousand paces on the other side is a similar one, clearly crystalline.\r\n\r\n[Hornblende and hornblende slate.] Half a league N. by E. from Mambulao\r\nis the lead-mountain of Dinianan. Here also all the works were fallen\r\nin, choked with mud and grown over. Only after a long search were\r\na few fragments found with traces of red-lead ore. This mountain\r\nconsists of hornblende rock; in one place, of hornblende slate,\r\nwith very beautiful large crystals.\r\n\r\n[Copper.] A league and a half S. from Mambulao a shallow hollow in\r\nthe ground marks the site of an old copper-mine, which must have\r\nbeen eighty-four feet deep. Copper ores are found in several places\r\nin Luzon; and specimens of solid copper were obtained by me at the\r\nBay of Luyang, N. of the Enseñada de Patag, in Caramuan.\r\n\r\n[Unsuccessful copper-mining.] Very considerable beds of copper ore\r\noccur in Mancayán, in the district of Lepanto, and in the central\r\nmountain-range of Luzon between Cagayán and Ilocos, which have been\r\nworked by a mining company in Manila since 1850; but the operations\r\nseem to have been most unsuccessful. In 1867 the society expended a\r\nconsiderable capital in the erection of smelting furnaces and hydraulic\r\nmachinery; but until a very recent date, owing to local difficulties,\r\nparticularly the want of roads, it has not produced any copper. [133]\r\n\r\n[Paying minus dividends.] In 1869 I heard, in London, that the\r\nundertaking had been given up. According to my latest information,\r\nhowever, it is certainly in progress; but the management have never,\r\nI believe, secured a dividend. The statement of 1872, in fact, shows\r\na loss, or, as the Spaniards elegantly say, a dividendo pasivo.\r\n\r\n[Igorot-mining successful.] What Europeans yet appear unable to\r\naccomplish, the wild Igorots, who inhabit that trackless range of\r\nmountains, have carried on successfully for centuries, and to a\r\nproportionally larger extent; and this is the more remarkable as\r\nthe metal in that district occurs only in the form of flints, which\r\neven in Europe can be made profitable only by particular management,\r\nand not without expense.\r\n\r\n[Long-established and considerable.] The copper introduced into\r\ncommerce by the Igorots from 1840 to 1855, partly in a raw state,\r\npartly manufactured, is estimated at three hundred piculs yearly. The\r\nextent of their excavations, and the large existing masses of slag,\r\nalso indicate the activity of their operations for a long period\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n[Copper kettles attributed to Negritos.] In the Ethnographical Museum\r\nat Berlin is a copper kettle made by those wild tribes. Meyer,\r\nwho brought it, states that it was made by the Negritos in the\r\ninterior of the island, and certainly with hammers of porphyry, as\r\nthey have no iron; and that he further found, in the collection of\r\nthe Captain General of the Philippines, a large shallow kettle of\r\nthree and one-half feet in diameter, which had been bought for only\r\nthree dollars; whence it may be inferred that, in the interior of\r\nthe island, the copper occurs in large masses, and probably solid;\r\nfor how could those rude, uncultivated negritos understand the art\r\nof smelting copper?\r\n\r\n[Copper-working a pre-Spanish art.] The locality of these rich\r\nquarries was still unknown to the Governor, although the copper\r\nimplements brought thence had, according to an official statement\r\nof his in 1833, been in use in Manila over two centuries. It is\r\nnow known that the copper-smiths are not Negritos but Igorots; and\r\nthere can be no question that they practiced this art, and the still\r\nmore difficult one of obtaining copper from flint, for a long period\r\nperhaps previous to the arrival of the Spaniards. They may possibly\r\nhave learnt them from the Chinese or Japanese. The chief engineer,\r\nSantos [134], and many others with him, are of opinion that this\r\nrace is descended from the Chinese or Japanese, from whom he insists\r\nthat it acquired not only its features (several travellers mention\r\nthe obliquely placed eyes of the Igorots), its idols, and some of\r\nits customs, but also the art of working in copper. At all events,\r\nthe fact that a wild people, living isolated in the mountains,\r\nshould have made such progress in the science of smelting, is of\r\nso great interest that a description of their procedure by Santos\r\n(essentially only a repetition of an earlier account by Hernandez,\r\nin the Revista Minera, i. 112) will certainly be acceptable.\r\n\r\n[The Igorots' Method.] The present mining district acquired by the\r\nsociety mentioned, the Sociedad Minero-metalurgica Cantabrofilipina\r\nde Mancayan, was divided amongst the Igorots into larger or smaller\r\nparcels strictly according to the number of the population of the\r\nadjacent villages, whose boundaries were jealously watched; and\r\nthe possessions of each separate village were again divided between\r\ncertain families; whence it is that those mountain districts exhibit,\r\nat the present day, the appearance of a honeycomb. To obtain the ore,\r\nthey made cavities, in which they lighted fires in suitable spots,\r\nfor the purpose of breaking the rock into pieces by means of the\r\nelasticity of the heated water contained in the crevices, with the\r\nadditional assistance of iron implements. The first breaking-up of\r\nthe ore was done in the stream-work itself, and the dead heaps lay\r\npiled up on the ground, so that, in subsequent fires, the flame of\r\nthe pieces of wood always reached the summit; and by reason of the\r\nquality of the rock, and the imperfection of the mode of procedure,\r\nvery considerable down-falls frequently occurred. The ores were divided\r\ninto rich and quartziferous; the former not being again melted, but\r\nthe latter being subjected to a powerful and persistent roasting,\r\nduring which, after a part of the sulphur, antimony, and arsenic\r\nhad been exhaled, a kind of distillation of sulphate of copper and\r\nsulphate of iron took place, which appeared as \"stone,\" or in balls\r\non the surface of the quartz, and could be easily detached. [135]\r\n\r\n[The Smelter.] The furnace or smelting apparatus consisted of a round\r\nhollow in clayey gound, thirty centimeters in diameter and fifteen\r\ndeep; with which was connected a conical funnel of fire-proof stone,\r\ninclined at an angle of 30°, carrying up two bamboo-canes, which were\r\nfitted into the lower ends of two notched pine-stems; in these two\r\nslips, covered all over with dry grass or feathers, moved alternately\r\nup and down, and produced the current required for the smelting.\r\n\r\n[Smelting.] When the Igorots obtained black copper or native copper by\r\nblasting, they prevented loss (by oxidation) by setting up a crucible\r\nof good fire-proof clay in the form of a still; by which means it was\r\neasier for them to pour the metal into the forms which it would acquire\r\nfrom the same clay. The furnace being arranged, they supplied it\r\nwith from eighteen to twenty kilograms of rich or roasted ore, which,\r\naccording to the repeated experiments of Hernandez, contained twenty\r\nper cent of copper; and they proceeded quite scientifically, always\r\nexposing the ore at the mouth of the funnel, and consequently to the\r\nair-drafts, and placing the coals at the sides of the furnace, which\r\nconsisted of loose stones piled one over another to the height of fifty\r\ncentimeters. The fire having been kindled and the blowing apparatus,\r\nalready described, in operation, thick clouds of white, yellow, and\r\norange-yellow smoke were evolved from the partial volatilization of the\r\nsulphur, arsenic, and antimony, for the space of an hour; but as soon\r\nas only sulphurous acid was formed, and the heat by this procedure\r\nhad attained its highest degree, the blowing was discontinued and\r\nthe product taken out. This consisted of a dross, or, rather, of the\r\ncollected pieces of ore themselves, which, on account of the flinty\r\ncontents of the stones composing the funnel, were transformed by the\r\ndecomposition of the sulphurous metal into a porous mass, and which\r\ncould not be converted into dross nor form combinations with silicious\r\nacid, being deficient in the base as well as in the requisite heat;\r\nand also of a very impure \"stone,\" of from four to five kilograms\r\nweight, and containing from fifty to sixty per cent of copper.\r\n\r\n[The copper \"stone\".] Several of these \"stones\" were melted down\r\ntogether for the space of about fifteen hours, in a powerful fire;\r\nand by this means a great portion of the three volatile substances\r\nabove named was again evolved; after which they placed them, now heated\r\nred-hot, in an upright position, but so as to be in contact with the\r\ndraught; the coals, however, being at the sides of the furnace. After\r\nblowing for an hour or half-an-hour, they thus obtained, as residuum,\r\na silicate of iron with antimony and traces of arsenic, a \"stone\"\r\ncontaining from seventy to seventy-five per cent of copper, which they\r\ntook off in very thin strips, at the same time using refrigerating\r\nvessels; and at the bottom of the hollow there remained, according\r\nas the mass was more or less freed from sulphur, a larger or smaller\r\nquantity (always, however, impure) of black copper.\r\n\r\n[Purifying the product.] The purified stones obtained by this second\r\nprocess were again made red-hot by placing them between rows of wood,\r\nin order that they might not melt into one another before the fire\r\nhad freed them from impurities.\r\n\r\nThe black copper obtained from the second operation, and the stones\r\nwhich were re-melted at the same time, were then subjected to a\r\nthird process in the same furnace (narrowed by quarry stones and\r\nprovided with a crucible); which produced a residuum of silicious\r\niron and black copper, which was poured out into clay moulds, and\r\nin this shape came into commerce. This black copper contained from\r\nninety-two to ninety-four per cent of copper, and was tinged by a\r\ncarbonaceous compound of the same metal known by its yellow color,\r\nand the oxide on the surface arising from the slow cooling, which will\r\noccur notwithstanding every precaution; and the surface so exposed\r\nto oxidation they beat with green twigs. When the copper, which had\r\nbeen thus extracted with so much skill and patience by the Igorots,\r\nwas to be employed in the manufacture of kettles, pipes, and other\r\ndomestic articles, or for ornament, it was submitted to another\r\nprocess of purification, which differed from the preceding only in\r\none particular, that the quantity of coals was diminished and the\r\nair-draught increased according as the process of smelting drew near\r\nto its termination, which involved the removal of the carbonaceous\r\ncompound by oxidation. Santos found, by repeated experiment, that even\r\nfrom ores of the mean standard of twenty per cent, only from eight to\r\nten per cent of black copper was extracted by the third operation; so\r\nthat between eight to twelve per cent still remained in the residuum\r\nor porous quartz of the operation.\r\n\r\n[Tagalog women traders.] It was difficult to procure the necessary\r\nmeans of transport for my baggage on the return journey to Paracale,\r\nthe roads being so soaked by the continuous rains that no one would\r\nventure his cattle for the purpose. In Mambulao the influence of\r\nthe province on its western border is very perceptible, and Tagalog\r\nis understood almost better than Bicol; the Tagalog element being\r\nintroduced amongst the population by women, who with their families\r\ncome here, from Lucban and Mauban, in the pursuit of trade. They buy up\r\ngold, and import stuffs and other wares in exchange. The gold acquired\r\nis commonly from fifteen to sixteen carats, and a mark determines\r\nits quality. The dealers pay on the average $11 per ounce; but when,\r\nas is usually the case, it is [Miners uncertain returns.] offered in\r\nsmaller quantities than one ounce, only $10. [136] They weigh with\r\nsmall Roman scales, and have no great reputation for honesty.\r\n\r\nNorth Camarines is thinly inhabited, the population of the mining\r\ndistricts having removed after the many undertakings which were\r\nartificially called into existence by the mining mania had been\r\nruined. The goldwashers are mostly dissolute and involved in debt,\r\nand continually expecting rich findings which but very seldom occur,\r\nand which, when they do occur, are forthwith dissipated;--a fact\r\nwhich will account for champagne and other articles of luxury being\r\nfound in the shops of the very poor villagers.\r\n\r\nMalaguit and Matango, during the dry season, are said to be connected\r\nby an extremely good road; but, when we passed, the two places were\r\nseparated by a quagmire into which the horses sank up to their middle.\r\n\r\n[Labo.] In Labo, a little village on the right bank of the river Labo\r\n(which rises in the mountain of the same name), the conditions to\r\nwhich we have adverted are repeated--vestiges of the works of former\r\nmining companies fast disappearing, and, in the midst, little pits\r\nbeing worked by the natives. Red lead has not been found here, but\r\ngold has been, and especially \"platinum,\" which some experiments\r\nhave proved to be lead-glance. The mountain Labo appears from its\r\nbell-shape and the strata exposed in the river bed to consist of\r\ntrachytic hornblende. Half a league W.S.W., after wading through mud\r\na foot deep, we reached the mountain Dallas where lead-glance and\r\ngold were formerly obtained by a mining company; and to the present\r\nday gold is obtained by a few natives in the usual mode.\r\n\r\n[Wild Cat Mining.] Neither in the latter province, nor in Manila, could\r\nI acquire more precise information respecting the histories of the\r\nnumerous unfortunate mining enterprises. Thus much, however, appears\r\ncertain, that they were originated only by speculators, and never\r\nproperly worked with sufficient means. They therefore, of necessity,\r\ncollapsed so soon as the speculators ceased from their operations.\r\n\r\n[Small output.] North Camarines yields no metal with the exception\r\nof the little gold obtained by the natives in so unprofitable a\r\nmanner. The king of Spain at first received a fifth, and then a\r\ntenth, of the produce; but the tax subsequently ceased. In Morga's\r\ntime the tenth amounted on an average to $10,000 (\"which was kept\r\nquite secret\"); the profit, consequently, to above $100,000. Gemelli\r\nCarreri was informed by the governor of Manila that gold to the value\r\nof $200,000 was collected annually without the help of either fire or\r\nquicksilver, and that Paracale, in particular, was rich in gold. No\r\ndata exist from which I could estimate the actual rate of produce; and\r\nthe answers to several inquiries deserve no mention. The produce is,\r\nat all events, very small, as well on account of the incompleteness\r\nof the mode of procedure as of the irregularity of labor, for the\r\nnatives work only when they are compelled by necessity.\r\n\r\n[Indang.] I returned down the stream in a boat to Indang, a\r\ncomparatively flourishing place, of smaller population but more\r\nconsiderable trade than Daet; the export consisting principally of\r\nabacá, and the import of rice.\r\n\r\n[Storms.] An old mariner, who had navigated this coast for many\r\nyears, informed me that the same winds prevail from Daet as far as\r\nCape Engaño, the north-east point of Luzon. From October to March\r\nthe north-east wind prevails, the monsoon here beginning with north\r\nwinds, which are of short duration and soon pass into the north-east;\r\nand in January and February the east winds begin and terminate\r\nthe monsoon. The heaviest rains fall from October to January, and\r\nin October typhoons sometimes occur. Beginning from the north or\r\nnorth-east, they pass to the north-west, where they are most violent;\r\nand then to the north and east, sometimes as far as to the south-east,\r\nand even to the south. In March and April, and sometimes in the\r\nbeginning of May, shifting winds blow, which bring in the south-west\r\nmonsoon; but the dry season, of which April and May are the driest\r\nmonths, is uninterrupted by rain. Thunder storms occur from June to\r\nNovember; most frequently in August. During the south-west monsoon\r\nthe sea is very calm; but in the middle of the north-east monsoon all\r\nnavigation ceases on the east coast. In the outskirts of Baler rice\r\nis sown in October, and reaped in March and April. Mountain rice is\r\nnot cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n[On foot to San Miguel bay.] Sending my baggage from Daet to Cabusao\r\nin a schooner, I proceeded on foot, by the road to that place, to\r\nthe coast on the west side of the Bay of San Miguel. We crossed the\r\nmouth of the river in a boat, which the horses swam after; but they\r\nwere soon abandoned from unfitness. At the mouth of the next river,\r\nSacavin, the water was so high that the bearers stripped themselves\r\nnaked and carried the baggage over on their heads. In simple jacket\r\nand cotton hose, I found this precaution needless; indeed, according\r\nto my experience, it is both refreshing and salutary to wear wet\r\nclothes, during an uniformly high temperature; besides which, one\r\nis thereby spared many a spring over ditches, and many a roundabout\r\ncourse to avoid puddles, which, being already wet through, we no longer\r\nfear. After having waded over eight other little rivers we were obliged\r\nto leave the shore and pursue the road to Colasi along steep, slippery,\r\nforest paths, the place lying right in the middle of the west side of\r\nthe bay. The sea-shore was very beautiful. Instead of a continuous and,\r\nat the ebb, ill-smelling border of mangroves, which is never wanting in\r\nthose places where the land extends into the sea, the waves here reach\r\nthe foot of the old trees of the forest, many of which were washed\r\nunderneath. Amongst the most remarkable was a fringe of stately old\r\nBarringtoni, covered with orchids and other epiphytes--gorgeous trees\r\nwhen in flower; the red stamens, five inches long, with golden yellow\r\nanthers like tassels, depending from the boughs; and their fruit, of\r\nthe size of the fist, is doubly useful to the fisherman, who employs\r\nthem, on account of their specific gravity, in floating his nets, and\r\nbeats them to pieces to stupefy the fish. The foremost trees stood bent\r\ntowards the sea, and have been so deflected probably for a long time,\r\nlike many others whose remains still projected out of the water. The\r\ndestruction of this coast appears to be very considerable. Amongst\r\nthe climbing palms one peculiar kind was very abundant, the stem of\r\nwhich, as thick as the arm, either dragged itself, leafless, along\r\nthe ground, or hung in arches above the branches, carrying a crown\r\nof leaves only at its extremity; while another, from its habitat the\r\ncommon calamus, had caryota leaves. Wild boars are very plentiful here;\r\na hunter offered us two at one real each.\r\n\r\n[Colasi.] The direction of the flat coast which extends N.N.W. to\r\nS.S.E. from the point of Daet is here interrupted by the little peak\r\nof Colasi, which projects to the east, and has grown so rapidly\r\nthat all old people remember it to have been lower. In the Visita\r\nColasi, on the northern slope of the mountain, the sea is so rough\r\nthat no boat can live in it. The inhabitants carry on fishing; their\r\nfishing-grounds lie, however, on the southern slope of the mountain,\r\nin the sheltered bay of Lalauigan, which we reached after thee hours'\r\njourney over the ridge.\r\n\r\n[By sea to Cabusao.] A four-oared baroto, hired at this place,\r\nas the weather was favorable, was to have conveyed us in two hours\r\nto Cabusao, the port of Naga; but the wind swung round, and a storm\r\nensued. Thoroughly wet and not without loss, we ran to Barceloneta,\r\na visita situated at a third of the distance. The intelligent Teniente\r\nof Colasi, whom we met here, also confirmed the fact of the rapid\r\ngrowth of the little peak.\r\n\r\n[Unreliable excuses.] In opposition to my wish to ascend the mountain,\r\ngreat obstacles were said to exist when every one would be occupied\r\nin preparations for the Easter festival, which would hardly occur\r\nduring the succeeding weeks. As these objections did not convince me,\r\na more substantial reason was discovered the next morning. Inland\r\nshoes are excellent for the mud, and particularly for horseback;\r\nbut for climbing mountains, or rough ground, they would not last a\r\nday; and the one remaining pair of strong European shoes, which I\r\nreserved for particular purposes, had been given away by my servant,\r\nwho did not like climbing mountains, on the pretext they were very\r\nmuch too heavy for me.\r\n\r\n[A shipwrecked family.] The shore from Barceloneta to Cabusao is of\r\nthe same character as the Daet-Colasi but running north and south;\r\nthe ground, sandy clay, is covered with a thick stratum of broken\r\nbivalves. The road was very difficult, as the high tide forced us to\r\nclimb between the trees and thick underwood. On the way we met an\r\nenterprising family who had left Daet with a cargo of coconuts for\r\nNaga, and had been wrecked here; saving only one out of five tinajas\r\nof oil, but recovering all the nuts. [137] They were living in a\r\nsmall hastily-run-up hut, upon coconuts, rice, fish, and mussels,\r\nin expectation of a favorable wind to return. There were several\r\nvarieties of shore-birds; but my gun would not go off, although\r\nmy servant, in expectation of a hunt, had cleaned it with especial\r\ncare. As he had lost the ramrod whilst cleaning it, the charge was\r\nnot withdrawn before we reached Cabusao, when it was discovered that\r\nboth barrels were full of sand to above the touchhole.\r\n\r\n[Making palm-sugar.] The coast was still more beautiful than on the\r\npreceding day, particularly in one place where the surge beat against a\r\nwood of fan-palms (Corypha sp.). On the side facing the sea, in groups\r\nor rows stood the trees, bereft of their crowns, or lying overthrown\r\nlike columns amid the vast ruins of temples (one of them was three feet\r\nin diameter); and the sight immediately reminded me of Pompeii. I could\r\nnot account for the bareness of the trunks, until I discovered a hut in\r\nthe midst of the palms, in which two men were endeavoring to anticipate\r\nthe waves in their work of destruction by the preparation of sugar\r\n(tunguleh). For this purpose, after stripping off the leaves (this\r\npalm flowering at the top), the upper end of the stem is cut across,\r\nthe surface of the incision being inclined about five degrees towards\r\nthe horizon, and, near its lower edge, hollowed out to a very shallow\r\ngutter. The juice exudes over the whole surface of the cut, with the\r\nexception of the intersected exterior petioles, and, being collected\r\nin the shallow channel, is conducted by a piece of banana-leaf,\r\ntwo inches broad, and four inches long, into a bamboo-cane attached\r\nto the trunk. In order to avert the rain from the saccharine issue,\r\nwhich has a faint, pleasantly aromatic flavor as of barley-sugar,\r\nall the trees which have been tapped are provided with caps formed of\r\nbent and folded palm-leaves. The average daily produce of each tree is\r\nfour bamboos, the interior of which is about three inches and a half\r\nin diameter. When removed, they are full to about eighteen inches;\r\nwhich gives somewhat more than ten quarts daily.\r\n\r\n[The money side.] The produce of each tree of course is very\r\nunequal. Always intermittent, it ceases completely after two months--at\r\nthe utmost, three months; but, the proportion of those newly cut to\r\nthose cut at an earlier date being the same, the yield of the incisions\r\nis about equal. The juice of thirty-three palms, after evaporation in\r\nan iron pan immediately upon each collection, produces one ganta, or\r\n(there being four such collections) four gantas, daily; the weekly\r\nresult being twenty gantas, or two tinajas of sugar, each worth two\r\ndollars and a half on the spot. This statement, derived from the people\r\nthemselves, probably shows the proportion somewhat more unfavorable\r\nthan it really is; still, according to the opinion of an experienced\r\nmestizo, the difference cannot be very considerable. Assuming the above\r\nfigures as correct, however, one of these magnificent trees would give\r\nabout one dollar and two-thirds, or, after deducting the laborers'\r\nwages one real per diem, about a thaler and two-thirds; not a large\r\nsum truly; but it is some consolation to know that, even if man did\r\nnot interfere, these trees would in process of time fall victims to\r\nthe breakers, and that, even if protected against external ravages,\r\nthey are doomed to natural extinction after once producing fruit.\r\n\r\n[Neglected roads.] Cabusao lies in the southern angle of San Miguel\r\nBay which is, almost on every side, surrounded by high mountains, and\r\naffords good anchorage for ships. From here I repaired across Naga to\r\nthe south coast. Four leagues from Naga, in the heart of Ragay, on the\r\nsouthern border of Luzon, is the small but deep harbor of Pasacao; and\r\ntwo hours by water conducted us to the intermediate Visita Pamplona,\r\nwhence the route is pursued by land. The still-existing remnant of the\r\nold road was in a miserable condition, and even at that dry season\r\nof the year scarcely passable; the bridges over the numerous little\r\nditches were broken down, and in many places, right across the road,\r\nlay large stones and branches of trees which had been brought there\r\nyears before to repair the bridges, and, having been unused, have\r\never since continued to obstruct the road.\r\n\r\n[A French planter.] In Quitang, between Pamplona and Pasacao, where two\r\nbrooks unite themselves into one little river debouching at the latter\r\nplace, a young Frenchman had established a hacienda. He was contented\r\nand hopeful, and loudly praised the industry and friendliness of his\r\npeople. Probably because they make fewer exactions, foreigners, as a\r\nrule, seem to agree better with the natives than Spaniards. Of these\r\nexactions, the bitterest complaints are rife of the injustice of the\r\ndemands made upon the lower classes in the settlement of their wages;\r\nwhich, if they do not immediately find the necessary hands for every\r\nemployment, do not correspond with the enhanced value of the products;\r\nand, according to them, the natives must even be driven from public\r\nemployments, to labor in their service. [138]\r\n\r\n[The Filipino as a laborer.] The Filipino certainly is more independent\r\nthan the European laborer, because he has fewer wants and, as a native\r\nlandowner, is not compelled to earn his bread as the daily laborer of\r\nanother; yet, with reference to wages, it may be questioned whether\r\nany colony whatever offers more favorable conditions to the planter\r\nthan the Philippines. In Dutch India, where the prevalence of monopoly\r\nalmost excludes private industry, free laborers obtain one-third of a\r\nguilder--somewhat more than one real, the usual wages in the wealthy\r\nprovinces of the Philippines (in the poorer it amounts to only the\r\nhalf); and the Javanese are not the equals of the Filipinos, either\r\nin strength, or intelligence, or skill; and the rate of wages in all\r\nthe older Slave States is well known. For the cultivation of sugar and\r\ncoffee, Mauritius and Ceylon are obliged to import foreign laborers\r\nat great expense, and to pay them highly; and yet they are successful.\r\n\r\n[Pasacao.] From Quitang to Pasacao the road was far worse than\r\nit had heretofore been; and this is the most important road in\r\nthe province! Before reaching Pasacao, evident signs are visible,\r\non the denuded sides of the limestone, of its having been formerly\r\nwashed by the sea. Pasacao is picturesquely situated at the end of the\r\nvalley which is intersected by the Itulan, and extends from Pamplona,\r\nbetween wooded mountains of limestone, as far as the sea. The ebb tides\r\nhere are extremely irregular. From noon to evening no difference was\r\nobservable, and, when the decrease just became visible, the tide rose\r\nagain. Immediately to the south, and facing the district, the side of a\r\nmountain, two thousand feet high and above one thousand feet broad, had\r\ntwo years ago given way to the subterranean action of the waves. The\r\nrock consists of a tough calcareous breccia, full of fragments of\r\nmussels and corals; but, being shoeless, I could not remain on the\r\nsharp rock sufficiently long to make a closer examination.\r\n\r\n[A beautiful coast.] For the same reason, I was obliged to leave\r\nthe ascent of the Yamtik, which I had before vainly attempted from\r\nLibmanan, unaccomplished from this point, although I had the advantage\r\nof the company of an obliging French planter in a boat excursion in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction along the coast. Here our boat floated along\r\nover gardens of coral, swarming with magnificently colored fishes;\r\nand after two hours we reached a cavern in the limestone, Suminabang,\r\nso low that one could stir in it only by creeping; which contained a\r\nfew swallows and bats. On the Calebayan river, on the further side of\r\nPoint Tanaun, we came upon a solitary shed, our night-quarters. Here\r\nthe limestone range is interrupted by an isolated cliff on the left\r\nbank of the little river, consisting of a crystalline rock chiefly\r\ncomposed of hornblende; which moreover, on the side exposed to the\r\nwater, is surrounded completely by limestone.\r\n\r\n[Cattle.] The surrounding mountains must swarm with wild boars. Under\r\nthe thatched roof of our hut, which serves as a shelter to occasional\r\nhunters, more than a hundred and fifty lower jaw-bones were set\r\nup as hunting trophies. The place appeared as if created for the\r\nbreeding of cattle. Soft with fodder grass, and covered with a few\r\ngroups of trees, with slopes intersected by rustling brooks, it rose\r\nup out of the sea, and was encompassed by a steep wall of rock in\r\nthe form of a semicircle; and here cattle would find grass, water,\r\nshade, and the protection of an enclosing rampart. While travelling\r\nalong the coast, we had remarked a succession of similar localities,\r\nwhich however, from lack of enterprise and from the dread of pirates,\r\nwere not utilized. As soon as our supper was prepared, we carefully\r\nextinguished our fire, that it might not serve as a signal to the\r\nvagabonds of the sea, and kept night watches.\r\n\r\n[A delusive cave.] On the following morning we intended to visit\r\na cave never before entered; but, to our astonishment, we found\r\nno proper cavern, but only an entrance to a cavern a few feet in\r\ndepth. Visible from a distance, it must often have been passed by\r\nthe hunters, although, as we were assured by our companions--who\r\nwere astonished at the delusion---no one had ventured to enter it\r\nfrom stress of superstitious terror.\r\n\r\n[Isolation of fertile regions.] The north coast of Camarines,\r\nas I have frequently mentioned, is, during the north-east monsoon,\r\nalmost unapproachable; while the south coast, screened by the outlying\r\nislands, remains always accessible. The most fertile districts of the\r\neastern provinces, which during summer export their produce by the\r\nnorthern ports, in the winter often remain for months cut off from\r\nall communication with the chief town, because there is no road over\r\nthe small strip of land to the south coast. How much has been done by\r\nNature, and how little by man, to facilitate this intercourse, is very\r\nevident when we reflect upon the condition of the road to Pasacao,\r\nlately described, in connection with the condition of matters in the\r\neast, as shown by the map.\r\n\r\n[River highways.] Two rivers, one coming from the north-west,\r\nand the other from the south-east, and both navigable before they\r\nreach the borders of the province, flow through the middle of it in\r\na line parallel with the coast (taking no account of its windings),\r\nand, after their junction, send their waters together through the\r\nestuary of Cabusao into the Bay of San Miguel. The whole province,\r\ntherefore, is traversed through its center by two navigable rivers,\r\nwhich, as regards commerce, form only one.\r\n\r\n[Cabusao and Pasacao harbors.] But the harbor of Cabusao, at the bottom\r\nof the Bay of San Miguel, is not accessible during the north-east\r\nmonsoon, and has this further disadvantage, that the intercourse of\r\nthe whole of the eastern part of Luzon with Manila can be carried\r\non only by a very circuitous route. On the south coast, on the other\r\nhand, is the harbor of Pasacao, into which a navigable little river,\r\nabove a mile in width, discharges itself; so that the distance between\r\nthis river highway and the nearest point of the Bicol River amounts to\r\na little more than a mile. The road connecting the two seas, laid out\r\nby an active alcalde in 1847, and maintained up to 1852, was however,\r\nat the date of my inquiry, in so bad a condition that a picul of abacá\r\npaid two reals freight for this short distance, in the dry season; and\r\nin the wet season it could not be forwarded for double the price. [139]\r\n\r\n[Bad roads raise freights.] Many similar instances may be brought\r\nforward. In 1861 the English vice-consul reported that in Iloilo a\r\npicul of sugar had risen more than 2 r. in price (as much as the cost\r\nof freight from Iloilo to Manila), in consequence of the bad state\r\nof the road between the two places, which are only one league asunder.\r\n\r\n[Social and political reasons for bad roads.] If, without reference to\r\ntransport by sea, the islands were not favored in so extraordinary a\r\nmanner by innumerable rivers with navigable mouths, a still greater\r\nproportion of their produce would not have been convertible into\r\nmoney. The people, as well as the local authorities, have no desire\r\nfor roads, which they themselves construct by forced labor, and,\r\nwhen completed, must maintain by the same method; for, when no roads\r\nare made, the laborers are so much more easily employed in private\r\noperations. Even the parish priests, generally, are as little favorable\r\nto the planning of commercial intercourse, by means of which trade,\r\nprosperity, and enlightenment would be introduced into the country,\r\nand their authority undermined. Indeed the Government itself, up\r\nto within a short time since, favored such a state of affairs; for\r\nbad roads belong to the essence of the old Spanish colonial policy,\r\nwhich was always directed to effect the isolation of the separate\r\nprovinces of their great transmarine possessions, and to prevent the\r\ngrowth of a sense of national interest, in order to facilitate their\r\ngovernment by the distant mother country.\r\n\r\n[Spanish economic backwardness.] Besides, in Spain itself matters\r\nare no better. The means of communication there are so very deficient\r\nthat, as an instance, merchandise is sent from Santander to Barcelona,\r\nround the whole Iberian peninsula, in preference to the direct route,\r\nwhich is partly accomplished by railway. [140] In Estremadura the hogs\r\nwere fed with wheat (live animals can be transported without roads),\r\nwhile at the same time the seaports were importing foreign grain. [141]\r\nThe cause of this condition of affairs in that country is to be sought\r\nless in a disordered state of finance, than in the enforcement of\r\nthe Government maxim which enjoins the isolation of separate provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mt. Isaróg.] The Isaróg (pronounced Issaró) rises up in the middle\r\nof Camarines, between San Miguel and Lagonoy bays. While its eastern\r\nslope almost reaches the sea, it is separated on its western side by\r\na broad strip of inundated land from San Miguel Bay. In circumference\r\nit is at least twelve leagues; and its height 1,966 meters. [142]\r\nVery flat at its base, it swells gradually to 16°, and higher up\r\nto 21° of inclination, and extends itself, in its western aspect,\r\ninto a flat dome-shaped summit. But, if viewed from the eastern side,\r\nit has the appearance of a circular chain of mountains rent asunder\r\nby a great ravine. On Coello's map this ravine is erroneously laid\r\ndown as extending from south to north; its bearing really is west to\r\neast. Right in front of its opening, and half a league south from Goa,\r\nlies the pretty little village of Rungus, by which it is known. The\r\nexterior sides of the mountain and the fragments of its large crater\r\nare covered with impenetrable wood. Respecting its volcanic eruptions\r\ntradition says nothing.\r\n\r\n[Primitive mountaineers.] The higher slopes form the dwelling-place\r\nof a small race of people, whose independence and the customs\r\nof a primitive age have almost entirely separated them from the\r\ninhabitants of the plain. One or two Cimarrons might occasionally\r\nhave been attracted hither, but no such instance is remembered. The\r\ninhabitants of the Isaróg are commonly, though mistakenly, called\r\nIgorots; and I retain the name, since their tribal relationship has not\r\nyet been accurately determined; they themselves maintaining that their\r\nancestors always dwelt in that locality. There are some who, in the\r\nopinion of the parish priest of Camarines, speak the Bicol language\r\nin the purest manner. Their manners and customs are very similar,\r\nin many respects, to what they were on the arrival of the Spaniards;\r\nand sometimes they also remind one of those prevailing among the Dyaks\r\nof Borneo at the present day. [143] These circumstances give rise to\r\nthe conjecture that they may be the last of a race which maintained\r\nits independence against the Spanish rule, and probably also against\r\nthe little tyrants who ruled over the plain before the arrival of the\r\nEuropeans. When Juan de Salcedo undertook his triumphal march round\r\nNorth Luzon he found everywhere, at the mouths of the rivers, seafaring\r\ntribes living under many chieftains who, after a short struggle, were\r\nslain by the superior discipline and better arms of the Spaniards,\r\nor submitted voluntarily to the superior race; but he did not succeed\r\nin subduing the independent tribes in the interior; and these are\r\nstill to be found in all the larger islands of the Philippine group.\r\n\r\n[Similarity to Indian Archipelago conditions.] Similar conditions are\r\nfound in many places in the Indian Archipelago. The Malays, carrying\r\non trade and piracy, possess the shore, and their language prevails\r\nthere; the natives being either subdued by them, or driven into the\r\nforests, the inaccessibility of which ensures to them a miserable\r\nbut independent existence. [144]\r\n\r\n[Policy of non-intercourse with heathens.] In order to break down\r\nthe opposition of the wild races, the Spanish Government forbade\r\nits subjects, under the penalty of one hundred blows and two years\r\nof forced labor, \"to trade or to have any intercourse with the\r\nheathens in the mountains who pay no tribute to his Catholic Majesty,\r\nfor although they would exchange their gold, wax, etc., for other\r\nnecessaries, they will never change for the better.\" Probably this\r\nlaw has for centuries directly contributed to save the barbarians,\r\nnotwithstanding their small numbers, from complete extermination;\r\nfor free intercourse between a people existing by agriculture,\r\nand another living principally by the chase, speedily leads to the\r\ndestruction of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Christian Mountaineers' villages.] The number of the Igorots of the\r\nIsaróg however, been much diminished by deadly battles between the\r\ndifferent ranchos, and by the marauding expeditions which, until\r\na short time since, were annually undertaken by the commissioners\r\nof taxes, in the interest of the Government monopoly, against\r\nthe tobacco fields of the Igorots. Some few have been \"pacified\"\r\n(converted to Christianity and tribute); in which case they are obliged\r\nto establish themselves in little villages of scattered huts, where\r\nthey can be occasionally visited by the priest of the nearest place;\r\nand, in order to render the change easier to them, a smaller tax than\r\nusual is temporarily imposed upon such newly-obtained subjects.\r\n\r\n[Tobacco monopoly wars.] I had deferred the ascent of the mountain\r\nuntil the beginning of the dry season of the year; but I learned in\r\nNaga that my wish was hardly practicable, because the expeditions\r\nagainst the ranchos of the mountain, which I have already mentioned,\r\nusually occurred about this time. As the wild people could not\r\nunderstand why they should not cultivate on their own fields a plant\r\nwhich had become a necessity to them, they saw in the Cuadrilleros,\r\nnot functionaries of a civilized State, but robbers, against whom\r\nthey were obliged to defend themselves by force; and appearances\r\ncontributed no less to confirm them in their error; for these did\r\nnot content themselves with destroying the plantations of tobacco,\r\nbut the huts were burnt to the ground, the fruit-trees hewn down, and\r\nthe fields laid waste. Such forays never occurred without bloodshed,\r\nand often developed into a little war which was carried on by the\r\nmountaineers for a long time afterwards, even against people who were\r\nentirely uninterested in it--Filipinos and Europeans. The expedition\r\nthis year was to take place in the beginning of April; the Igorots\r\nconsequently were in a state of great agitation, and had, a few\r\ndays previously, murdered a young unarmed Spaniard in the vicinity\r\nof Mabotoboto, at the foot of the mountain, by bringing him to the\r\nground with a poisoned arrow, and afterwards inflicting twenty-one\r\nwounds with the wood-knife (bolo).\r\n\r\n[A policy of peace.] Fortunately there arrived soon after a countermand\r\nfrom Manila, where the authorities seemed to have been gradually\r\nconvinced of the harmful tendency of such violent measures. It could\r\nnot be doubted that this intelligence would quickly spread amongst the\r\nranchos; and, acting upon the advice of the commandant (upon whom,\r\nvery much against his inclination, the conduct of the expedition\r\nhad devolved), I lost no time in availing myself of the anticipated\r\nseason of quiet. The Government have since adopted the prudent method\r\nof purchasing the tobacco, which is voluntarily cultivated by the\r\nIgorots, at the ordinary rate, and, where practicable, encouraging\r\nthem to lay out new fields, instead of destroying those in existence.\r\n\r\n[A populous fertile district.] The next day at noon I left Naga on\r\nhorseback. The pueblos of Mogarao, Canaman, Quipayo, and Calabanga, in\r\nthis fertile district follow so thickly upon one another that they form\r\nan almost uninterrupted succession of houses and gardens. Calabanga\r\nlies half a league from the sea, between the mouths of two rivers,\r\nthe more southerly of which is sixty feet broad and sufficiently deep\r\nfor large trading vessels. [145]\r\n\r\n[A bare plain and wretched village.] The road winds round the foot\r\nof the Isaróg first to the north-east and then to the east. Soon the\r\nblooming hedges cease, and are succeeded by a great bare plain, out of\r\nwhich numerous flat hillocks raise themselves. Both hills and plain,\r\nwhen we passed, served for pasturage; but from August to January they\r\nare sown with rice; and fields of batata are occasionally seen. After\r\nfour hours we arrived at the little village of Maguiring (Manguirin),\r\nthe church of which, a tumble-down shed, stood on an equally naked\r\nhillock; and from its neglected condition one might have guessed that\r\nthe priest was a native.\r\n\r\n[Many mountain water courses.] This hillock, as well as the others\r\nwhich I examined, consisted of the débris of the Isaróg, the more\r\nor less decomposed trachytic fragments of hornblende rock, the\r\nspaces between which were filled up with red sand. The number of\r\nstreams sent down by the Isaróg, into San Miguel and Lagonoy bays,\r\nis extraordinarily large. On the tract behind Maguiring I counted, in\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, five considerable estuaries, that is to say,\r\nabove twenty feet broad; and then, as far as Goa, twenty-six more;\r\naltogether, thirty-one: but there are more, as I did not include\r\nthe smallest; and yet the distance between Maguiring and Goa, in\r\na straight line, does not exceed three miles. This accounts for\r\nthe enormous quantity of steam with which this mighty condenser is\r\nfed. I have not met with this phenomenon on any other mountain in so\r\nstriking a manner. One very remarkable circumstance is the rapidity\r\nwith which the brimming rivulets pass in the estuaries, enabling them\r\nto carry the trading vessels, sometimes even ships, into a main stream\r\n(if the expression may be allowed), while the scanty contributions\r\nof their kindred streams on the northern side have scarcely acquired\r\nthe importance of a mill-brook. These waters, from their breadth, look\r\nlike little rivers, although in reality they consist of only a brook,\r\nup to the foot of the mountain, and of a river's mouth in the plain;\r\nthe intermediate part being absent.\r\n\r\n[Comparison with Javan Mountain district.] The country here is\r\nstrikingly similar to the remarkable mountain district of the\r\nGelungúng, described by Junghuhn; [146] yet the origin of these\r\nrising grounds differs in some degree from that of those in Java. The\r\nlatter were due to the eruption of 1822, and the great fissure in the\r\nwall of the crater of the Gelungúng, which is turned towards them,\r\nshows unmistakably whence the materials for their formation were\r\nderived; but the great chasm of the Isaróg opens towards the east,\r\nand therefore has no relation to the numberless hillocks on the\r\nnorth-west of the mountain. Behind Maguiring they run more closely\r\ntogether, their summits are flatter, and their sides steeper; and they\r\npass gradually into a gently inclined slope, rent into innumerable\r\nclefts, in the hollows of which as many brooks are actively employed\r\nin converting the angular outlines of the little islands into these\r\nrounded hillocks. The third river behind Maguiring is larger than\r\nthose preceding it; on the sixth lies the large Visita of Borobod;\r\nand on the tenth, that of Ragay. The rice fields cease with the hill\r\ncountry, and on the slope, which is well drained by deep channels,\r\nonly wild cane and a few groups of trees grow. Passing by many\r\nvillages, whose huts were so isolated and concealed that they might\r\nremain unobserved, we arrived at five o'clock at Tagunton; from which\r\na road, practicable for carabao carts, and used for the transport of\r\nthe abacá grown in the district, leads to Goa; and here, detained by\r\nsickness, I hired a little house, in which I lay for nearly four weeks,\r\nno other remedies offering themselves to me but hunger and repose.\r\n\r\n[Useful friends.] During this time I made the acquaintance of some\r\nnewly-converted Igorots, and won their confidence. Without them I would\r\nhave had great difficulty in ascending the mountains as well as to\r\nvisit their tribe in its farms without any danger. [147] When, at last,\r\nI was able to quit Goa, my friends conducted me, as the first step,\r\nto their settlement; where, having been previously recommended and\r\nexpected, I easily obtained the requisite number of attendants to take\r\ninto their charge the animals and plants which were collected for me.\r\n\r\n[A heathen Mountaineers' settlement.] On the following morning the\r\nascent was commenced. Even before we arrived at the first rancho,\r\nI was convinced of the good report that had preceded me. The master\r\nof the house came towards us and conducted us by a narrow path to his\r\nhut, after having removed the foot-lances, which projected obliquely\r\nout of the ground, but were dexterously concealed by brushwood and\r\nleaves. [148] A woman employed in weaving, at my desire, continued\r\nher occupation. The loom was of the simplest kind. The upper end,\r\nthe chain-beam, which consists of a piece of bamboo, is fixed to\r\ntwo bars or posts; and the weaver sits on the ground, and to the two\r\nnotched ends of a small lath, which supplies the place of the weaving\r\nbeam, hooks on a wooden bow, in the arch of which the back of the\r\nlath is fitted. Placing her feet against two pegs in the ground and\r\nbending her back, she, by means of the bow, stretches the material\r\nout straight. A netting-needle, longer than the breadth of the web,\r\nserves instead of the weaver's shuttle, but it can be pushed through\r\nonly by considerable friction, and not always without breaking the\r\nchains of threads. A lath of hard wood (caryota), sharpened like a\r\nknife, represents the trestle, and after every stroke it is placed\r\nupon the edge; after which the comb is pushed forward, a thread put\r\nthrough, and struck fast, and so forth. The web consisted of threads\r\nof the abacá, which were not spun, but tied one to another.\r\n\r\n[A giant fern hedge.] The huts I visited deserve no special\r\ndescription. Composed of bamboos and palm-leaves, they are not\r\nessentially different from the dwellings of poor Filipinos; and in\r\ntheir neighborhood were small fields planted with batata, maize,\r\ncaladium and sugar-cane, and enclosed by magnificent polypody\r\nferns. One of the highest of these, which I caused to be felled for\r\nthe purpose, measured in the stem nine meters, thirty centimeters;\r\nin the crown, two meters, twelve centimeters; and its total length\r\nwas eleven meters, forty-two centimeters or over thirty-six feet.\r\n\r\n[Simple stringed instruments.] A young lad produced music on a kind of\r\nlute, called baringbau; consisting of the dry shaft of the scitamina\r\nstretched in the form of a bow by means of a thin tendril instead of\r\ngut. Half a coco shell is fixed in the middle of the bow, which, when\r\nplaying, is placed against the abdomen, and serves as a sounding board;\r\nand the string when struck with a short wand, gave out a pleasing\r\nhumming sound, realizing the idea of the harp and plectrum in their\r\nsimplest forms. Others accompanied the musician on Jews' harps of\r\nbamboos, as accurate as those of the Mintras on the Malay Peninsula;\r\nand there was one who played on a guitar, which he had himself made,\r\nbut after a European pattern. The hut contained no utensils besides\r\nbows, arrows, and a cooking pot. The possessor of clothes bore them\r\non his person. I found the women as decently clad as the Filipino\r\nChristian women, and carrying, besides, a forest knife, or bolo. As\r\na mark of entire confidence, I was taken into the tobacco fields,\r\nwhich were well concealed and protected by foot-lances; and they\r\nappeared to be carefully looked after.\r\n\r\n[The people and their crops.] The result of my familiarity with\r\nthis people, both before and after this opportunity, may be briefly\r\nsummed up: They live on the higher slopes of the mountain, never,\r\nindeed, below 1,500 feet; each family by itself. It is difficult to\r\nascertain how many of them there may now be, as but little intercourse\r\ntakes place amongst them. In the part of the mountain belonging to\r\nthe district of Goa, their number is estimated at about fifty men\r\nand twenty women, including the children: but twenty years before\r\nthe population was more numerous. Their food consists principally\r\nof batata, besides some gabi (caladium). A little maize is likewise\r\ncultivated, as well as some ubi (dioscorea), and a small quantity of\r\nsugar-cane for chewing.\r\n\r\n[Batatas.] In laying out a batata field, a wood is partially cleared,\r\nthe earth loosened with the blunt forest knife (bolo), and the bulbs\r\nor layers then planted; and within four months the harvest begins,\r\nand continues uninterruptedly from the time the creeping plant strikes\r\nroot and forms tubers. [Rotation of crops.] After two years, however,\r\nthe produce is so much diminished that the old plants are pulled up,\r\nin order to make room for new ones obtained from the runners. The\r\nfield is then changed, or other fruits cultivated thereon, but with\r\nthe addition of manure. A piece of land, fifty brazas long, and thirty\r\nwide, is sufficient for the support of a family. Only occasionally in\r\nthe wet season does this resource fail, and then they resort to gabi,\r\nwhich appears to be as easily cultivated on wet as on dry ground,\r\nbut is not so profitable as batata. The young shoots of the gabi are\r\nplanted at distances of a vara, and if consumed in a proper manner,\r\nought not to be cropped till after a year. Each family kills weekly\r\none or two wild hogs. Stags are rare, although I obtained a fine\r\npair of horns; and they do not use the skin. Bows and arrows are\r\nused in hunting; some poisoned, and some not. Every rancho keeps\r\ndogs, which live principally on batata, and also cats to protect the\r\nfields against rats; and they also have poultry, [Game cocks a Spanish\r\ninnovation.] but no game cocks; which, having been first introduced\r\ninto the Philippines by the Spaniards are seldom if ever, wanting in\r\nthe huts of the Filipinos; but the inhabitants of the Isaróg are as\r\nyet free from this passion.\r\n\r\n[Trade.] The few products of a more advanced civilization which they\r\nrequire, they obtain by the sale of the spontaneous productions of\r\ntheir forests, chiefly wax and resin (pili), [149] apnik, dagiangan\r\n(a kind of copal), and some abacá. Wax, which is much in request\r\nfor church solemnities, fetches half a dollar per catty; and resin\r\naverages half a real per chinanta. Business is transacted very\r\nsimply. Filipinos, having intercourse with the Igorots, make a\r\ncontract with them; and they collect the products and bring them\r\nto a place previously agreed on, where the Filipinos receive them,\r\nafter paying down the stipulated price.\r\n\r\n[Religion.] Physicians and magicians, or persons supposed to be\r\npossessed of secret powers, are unknown; every one helps himself. In\r\norder to arrive at a clear understanding of their religious views,\r\na longer intercourse would be necessary. But they certainly believe\r\nin one God, or, at least, say so, when they are closely questioned\r\nby Christians; and have also loosely acquired several of the external\r\npractices of Catholicism, which they employ as spells.\r\n\r\n[Respect for women and aged.] Hunting and hard labor constitute the\r\nemployment of man in general, as well as in the Philippines. The\r\npractice of employing women as beasts of burden--which, although\r\nit exists among many of the peoples of Europe, for example, the\r\nBasques, Wallachians, and Portuguese, is almost peculiar to barbarous\r\nnations,--seems to have been lost in the Philippines as far back\r\nas the time of its discovery by the Spaniards; and even among the\r\nwild people of the Isaróg, the women engage only in light labor,\r\nand are well treated. Every family supports its aged and those unfit\r\nfor labor. [Medicine.] Headaches and fevers were stated to me as the\r\nprevalent maladies; for which burnt rice, pounded and mixed to a pap\r\nwith water, is taken as a remedy; and in case of severe headache they\r\nmake an incision in the forehead of the sufferer. Their prevalence is\r\nexplained by the habit of neutralizing the ill effects of drinking\r\nwater in excess, when they are heated, by the consumption of warm\r\nwater in large doses; and the rule holds with regard to coco-water;\r\nthe remedy for immoderate use of which is warm coco-water. Their\r\nmuscular power is small, and they are not able to carry more than\r\nfifty pounds weight to any considerable distance.\r\n\r\n[Manufactures.] Besides the chase and agriculture, their occupations\r\nare restricted to the manufacture of extremely rude weapons, for which\r\nthey purchase the iron, when required, from the Filipinos, and of\r\nthe coarse webs made by the women, and of wicker work. Every father\r\nof a family is master in his own house, and acknowledges no power\r\nhigher than himself. In the event of war with neighboring tribes,\r\nthe bravest places himself at the head, and the rest follow him as\r\nlong as they are able; there is no deliberate choosing of a leader.\r\n\r\n[Death customs.] On the whole, they are peaceful and honorable towards\r\neach other, although the idle occasionally steal the fruits of the\r\nfields; and, should the thief be caught, the person robbed punishes\r\nhim with blows of the rattan, without being under any apprehensions\r\nof vengeance in consequence. If a man dies, his nearest kinsmen\r\ngo out to requite his death by the death of some other individual,\r\ntaken at random. The rule is strictly enforced. For a dead man a man\r\nmust be killed; for a woman a woman; and for a child a child. Unless,\r\nindeed, it be a friend they encounter, the first victim that offers\r\nis killed. Latterly, however, owing to the unusual success attained by\r\nsome of them in representing the occurrence of death as an unavoidable\r\ndestiny, the custom is said to have fallen into desuetude; and the\r\nrelatives do not exact the satisfaction. This was easy in the case\r\nof the deceased being an ordinary person; but, to the present day,\r\nvengeance is required in the event of the death of a beloved child or\r\nwife. If a man kills a woman of another house, her nearest kinsman\r\nendeavors to kill a woman of the house of the murderer; but to the\r\nmurderer himself he does nothing; and the corpse of the victim thus\r\nslain as a death-offering is not buried, nor is its head cut off; and\r\nher family, in their turn, seek to avenge the death by murder. This\r\nis reckoned the most honorable course. Should the murderer, however,\r\nbe too strong to be so overcome, any weaker person, be it who it may,\r\nis slain in retaliation; and hence, probably, the comparatively small\r\nnumber of women.\r\n\r\n[Marriage.] Polygamy is permitted; but even the most courageous\r\nand skilful seldom or never have more than one wife. A young man\r\nwishing to marry commissions his father to treat with the father\r\nof the bride as to the price; which latterly has greatly increased;\r\nbut the average is ten bolos, costing from four to six reals each,\r\nand about $12 in cash; and the acquisition of so large a sum by\r\nthe sale of wax, resin, and abacá, often takes the bridegroom two\r\nyears. The bride-money goes partly to the father, and partly to the\r\nnearest relations; every one of whom has an equal interest. If there\r\nshould be many of them, almost nothing remains for the father, who\r\nhas to give a great feast, on which occasion much palm-wine is drunk.\r\n\r\n[Sexual crimes.] Any man using violence towards a girl is killed by\r\nher parents. If the girl was willing, and the father hears of it,\r\nhe agrees upon a day with the former, on which he is to bring the\r\nbride's dowry; which should he refuse to do, he is caught by the\r\nrelations, bound to a tree, and whipped with a cane. Adultery is\r\nof most rare occurrence; but, when it does take place, the dowry is\r\nreturned either by the woman, who then acquires her freedom, or by\r\nthe seducer, whom she then follows. The husband has not the right to\r\ndetain her, if he takes the money, or even if he should refuse it;\r\nbut the latter contingency is not likely to arise, since that sum of\r\nmoney will enable him to buy for himself a new wife.\r\n\r\n[Basira ravine.] In the afternoon we reached a vast ravine, called\r\n\"Basira,\" 973 meters above Uacloy, and about 1,134 meters above\r\nthe sea, extending from south-east to north-west between lofty,\r\nprecipitous ranges, covered with wood. Its base, which has an\r\ninclination of 33°, consists of a naked bed of rock, and, after every\r\nviolent rainfall, gives issue to a torrent of water, which discharges\r\nitself violently. Here we bivouacked; and the Igorots, in a very short\r\ntime, built a hut, and remained on the watch outside. At daybreak\r\nthe thermometer stood at 13.9° R. [150]\r\n\r\n[At the summit.] The road to the summit was very difficult on account\r\nof the slippery clay earth and the tough network of plants; but the\r\nlast five hundred feet were unexpectedly easy, the very steep summit\r\nbeing covered with a very thick growth of thinly leaved, knotted, mossy\r\nthibaudia, rhododendra, and other dwarf woods, whose innumerable tough\r\nbranches, running at a very small height along the ground and parallel\r\nto it, form a compact and secure lattice-work, by which one mounted\r\nupwards as on a slightly inclined ladder. The point which we reached *\r\n* * was evidently the highest spur of the horseshoe-shaped mountain\r\nside, which bounds the great ravine of Rungus on the north. The top\r\nwas hardly fifty paces in diameter, and so thickly covered with trees\r\nthat I have never seen its like; we had not room to stand. My active\r\nhosts, however, went at once to work, though the task of cutting a path\r\nthrough the wood involved severe labor, and, chopping off the branches,\r\nbuilt therewith, on the tops of the lopped trees, an observatory, from\r\nwhich I should have had a wide panoramic view, and an opportunity for\r\ntaking celestial altitudes, had not everything been enveloped in a\r\nthick mist. The neighboring volcanoes were visible only in glimpses,\r\nas well as San Miguel Bay and some lakes in the interior. Immediately\r\nafter sunset the thermometer registered 12.5° R. [151]\r\n\r\n[The descent.] On the following morning it was still overcast; and\r\nwhen, about ten o'clock, the clouds became thicker, we set out on\r\nour return. It was my intention to have passed the night in a rancho,\r\nin order next day to visit a solfatara which was said to be a day's\r\njourney further; but my companions were so exhausted by fatigue that\r\nthey asked for at least a few hours' rest.\r\n\r\n[Ferns and orchids.] On the upper slope I observed no palms with the\r\nexception of calamus; but polypodies (ferns) were very frequent, and\r\norchids surprisingly abundant. In one place all the trees were hung,\r\nat a convenient height, with flowering aërids; of which one could have\r\ncollected thousands without any trouble. The most beautiful plant\r\nwas a Medinella, of so delicate a texture that it was impossible to\r\npreserve it.\r\n\r\n[Carbonic acid spring.] Within a quarter of an hour north-east\r\nof Uacloy, a considerable spring of carbonic acid bursts from the\r\nground, depositing abundance of calcareous sinter. Our torches were\r\nquickly extinguished, and a fowl covered with a cigar-box died in\r\na few minutes, to the supreme astonishment of the Igorots, to whom\r\nthese phenomena were entirely new.\r\n\r\n[Farewell to mountaineers.] On the second day of rest, my poor hosts,\r\nwho had accompanied me back to Uacloy, still felt so weary that they\r\nwere not fit for any undertaking. With naked heads and bellies they\r\nsquatted in the burning sun in order to replenish their bodies with\r\nthe heat which they had lost during the bivouac on the summit; for\r\nthey are not allowed to drink wine. When I finally left them on the\r\nfollowing day, we had become such good friends that I was compelled\r\nto accept a tamed wild pig as a present. A troop of men and women\r\naccompanied me until they saw the glittering roofs of Maguiring,\r\nwhen, after the exchange of hearty farewells, they returned to their\r\nforests. The natives whom I had taken with me from Goa had proved\r\nso lazy and morose that nearly the whole task of making the path\r\nthrough the forest had fallen upon the Igorots. From sheer laziness\r\nthey threw away the drinking water of which they were the porters;\r\nand the Igorots were obliged to fetch water from a considerable\r\ndistance for our bivouac on the summit. In all my troublesome marches,\r\nI have always done better with Cimarrons than with the civilized\r\nnatives. The former I have found obliging, trustworthy, active and\r\nacquainted with localities, while the latter generally displayed the\r\nopposite qualities. It would, however, be unjust to form a conclusive\r\nopinion as to their comparative merits from these facts; for the\r\nwild people are at home when in the forest; what they do is done\r\nvoluntarily, and the stranger, when he possesses their confidence, is\r\ntreated as a guest. [Forced labor.] But the Filipinos are reluctant\r\ncompanions, Polistas, who, even when they receive a high rate of\r\nwages, consider that they are acting most honorably when they do as\r\nlittle as possible. At any rate, it is no pleasure to them to leave\r\ntheir village in order to become luggage-porters or beaters of roads\r\non fatiguing marches in impracticable districts, and to camp out in\r\nthe open air under every deprivation. For them, still more than for\r\nthe European peasant, repose is the most agreeable refreshment. The\r\nless comfort any one enjoys at home, the greater is the reluctance\r\nwith which he leaves it; and the same thing may be observed in Europe.\r\n\r\n[A petition for liquors.] As the Igorots were not permitted to\r\nhave cocoa-palms for the preparation of wine, vinegar and brandy,\r\nso that they might not infringe the monopoly of the government,\r\nthey presented me with a petition entreating me to obtain this\r\nfavor for them. The document was put together by a Filipino writer\r\nin so ludicrously confused a manner that I give it as a specimen of\r\nPhilippine clerkship. [152] At all events, it had the best of results,\r\nfor the petitioners were accorded twice as much as they had prayed for.\r\n\r\n[Winds and planting season.] The south-west monsoon lasts in this\r\nregion (district of Goa) from April to October. April is very calm\r\n(navegación de señoras). From June to August the south-west winds\r\nblow steadily; March, April, and May are the driest months; there are\r\nshifting winds in March and the beginning of April; while from October\r\nto December is the time of storms; \"S. Francisco (4th October) brings\r\nbad weather.\" Rice is planted in September and reaped in February.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mt. Iriga.] From the Isarog I returned through Naga and Nabua to\r\nIriga, the ascent of which I at length accomplished.\r\n\r\n[The ascent.] The chief of the Montesinos had received daily rations\r\nfor twenty-two men, with whom he professed to make a road to the\r\nsummit; but when, on the evening of the third day, he came himself\r\nto Iriga, in order to fetch more provisions, on the pretext that\r\nthe work still required some time for execution, I explained that\r\nI should endeavor to ascend the mountain on the following morning,\r\nand requested him to act as guide. He consented, but disappeared,\r\ntogether with his companions, during the night; the Filipinos in\r\nthe tribunal having been good enough to hold out the prospect of\r\nsevere punishment in case the work performed should not correspond\r\nto the working days. After fruitless search for another guide,\r\nwe left Buhi in the afternoon, and passed the night in the rancho,\r\nwhere we had previously been so hospitably received. The fires were\r\nstill burning, but the inhabitants, on our approach, had fled. About\r\nsix o'clock on the following morning the ascent began. After we had\r\ngone through the forest, by availing ourselves of the path which we\r\nhad previously beaten, it led us through grass three or four feet\r\nin height, with keen-edged leaves; succeeded by cane, from seven\r\nto eight feet high, of the same habitat with our Arundo phragmites\r\n(but it was not in flower), which occupied the whole of the upper\r\npart of the mountain as far as the edge. Only in the ravine did the\r\ntrees attain any height. The lower declivities were covered with\r\naroids and ferns; towards the summit were tendrils and mosses; and\r\nhere I found a beautiful, new, and peculiarly shaped orchid. [153]\r\nThe Cimarrons had cut down some cane; and, beating down our road for\r\nourselves with bolos, we arrived at the summit a little before ten\r\no'clock. It was very foggy. In the hope of a clear evening or morning\r\nI caused a hut to be erected, for which purpose the cane was well\r\nfitted. The natives were too lazy to erect a lodging for themselves,\r\nor to procure wood for a watchfire. They squatted on the ground,\r\nsqueezed close to one another to warm themselves, ate cold rice,\r\nand suffered thirst because none of them would fetch water. Of the\r\ntwo water-carriers whom I had taken with me, one had \"inadvertently\"\r\nupset his water on the road, and the other had thrown it away \"because\r\nhe thought we should not require it.\"\r\n\r\n[Altitude.] I found the highest points of the Iriga to be 1,212\r\nmeters, 1,120 meters above the surface of the Buhi Lake. From Buhi\r\nI went to Batu.\r\n\r\n[Changes in Batu Lake.] The Batu Lake (one hundred eleven meters\r\nabove the sea) had sunk lower since my last visit in February. The\r\ncarpet of algae had increased considerably in breadth, its upper\r\nedge being in many places decomposed; and the lower passed gradually\r\ninto a thick consistency of putrid water-plants (charae, algae,\r\npontederiae, valisneriae, pistiae, etc.), which encompassed the\r\nsurface of the water so that only through a few gaps could one reach\r\nthe bank. Right across the mouth of the Quinali lies, in the lake,\r\na bar of black mud, the softest parts of which were indicated by some\r\ninsignificant channels of water. As we could not get over the bar in\r\na large boat, two small skiffs were bound together with a matting of\r\nbamboo, and provided with an awning. By means of this contrivance,\r\nwhich was drawn by three strong carabaos (the whole body of men with\r\nevident delight and loud mirth wading knee-deep in the black mud\r\nand assisting by pushing behind) we succeeded, as if on a sledge,\r\nin getting over the obstacle into the river; which on my first visit\r\noverflowed the fields in many places, till the huts of the natives\r\nrose out of the water like so many ships: but now (in June) not one\r\nof its channels was full. We were obliged in consequence to continue\r\nour sledge journey until we were near to Quinali.\r\n\r\n[Ascent of Mt. Mazaraga.] At Ligao I alighted at a friendly Spaniard's,\r\na great part of the place, together with the tribunal and convent,\r\nhaving been burnt down since my last visit. After making the necessary\r\npreparations, I went in the evening to Barayong, a little rancho\r\nof Cimarrons at the foot of the Mazaraga, and, together with its\r\ninhabitants, ascended the mountain on the following morning. The\r\nwomen also accompanied us for some distance, and kept the company in\r\ngood humor; and when, on the road, a Filipino who had been engaged\r\nfor the purpose wished to give up carrying a bamboo full of water,\r\nand, throwing it away, ran off, an old woman stepped forward in his\r\nstead, and dragged the water cheerfully along up to the summit. This\r\nmountain was moister than any I had ever ascended, the Semeru in\r\nJava, in some respects, excepted; and half-way up I found some rotten\r\nrafflesia. [154] Two miserable-looking Cimarron dogs drove a young\r\nstag towards us, which was slain by one of the people with a blow\r\nof his bolo. The path ceased a third of the way up, but it was not\r\ndifficult to get through the wood. The upper portion of the mountain,\r\nhowever, being thickly overgrown with cane, again presented great\r\nobstacles. About twelve we reached the summit-level, which, pierced by\r\nno crater, is almost horizontal, smoothly arched, and thickly covered\r\nwith cane. [Altitude.] Its height is 1,354 meters. In a short time the\r\nindefatigable Cimarrons had built a fine large hut of cane: one room\r\nfor myself and the baggage, a large assembly-room for the people,\r\nand a special apartment for cooking. Unfortunately the cane was so\r\nwet that it would not burn. In order to procure firewood to cook the\r\nrice, thick branches were got out of the wood, and their comparatively\r\ndry pith extracted with great labor. The lucifer-matches, too, were\r\nso damp that the phosphorus was rubbed away in friction; but, being\r\ncollected on blotting-paper, and kneaded together with the sulphurous\r\nend of the match-wood, it became dry and was kindled by friction. Not\r\na trace of solid rock was to be seen. All was obstructed by a thick\r\novergrowth from where the path ceased, and the ground covered with\r\na dense bed of damp wood-earth. The following morning was fine, and\r\nshowed a wide panorama; but, before I had completed my drawing, it\r\nagain became misty; and as, after several hours of waiting, the heavens\r\nwere overspread with thick rain-clouds, we set out on our return.\r\n\r\n[Butterflies.] Numerous butterflies swarmed around the summit. We\r\ncould, however, catch only a few, as the passage over the cane-stubble\r\nwas too difficult for naked feet; and, the badly-stitched soles of\r\ntwo pairs of new shoes which I had brought from Manila having dropped\r\noff some time before I reached the summit, I was compelled to perform\r\nthe journey to Ligao barefoot.\r\n\r\n[Native contempt for private Spaniards.] On the following day my\r\nSpanish host went twice to the tribunal to procure the carabao carts\r\nwhich were necessary for the furtherance of my collections. His\r\ncourteous request was unsuccessful; but the command of the parish\r\npriest, who personally informed the Gobernadorcillo in his house,\r\nwas immediately obeyed. The Filipino authorities have, as a rule, but\r\nlittle respect for private Spanish people, and treat them not seldom\r\nwith open contempt. An official recommendation from the alcalde is\r\nusually effectual, but not in all the provinces; for many alcaldes do\r\nhurt to their own authority by engaging the assistance or connivance of\r\nthe native magistrates in the furtherance of their personal interests.\r\n\r\n[Giant bats.] I here shot some panikes, great bats with wings nearly\r\nfive feet wide when extended, which in the day time hang asleep from\r\nthe branches of trees, and, among them, two mothers with their young\r\nsucking ones uninjured. It was affecting to see how the little animals\r\nclung more and more firmly to the bodies of their dying parents,\r\nand how tenderly they embraced them even after these were dead. The\r\napparent feeling, however, was only self-interest at bottom, for,\r\nwhen their store of milk was exhausted, the old ones were treated\r\nwithout respect, like empty bottles. As soon as the young ones were\r\nseparated, they fed on bananas, and lived several days, until I at\r\nlength placed them in spirits.\r\n\r\n[A muddy dry season.] Early in the morning I rode on the priest's\r\nhorse to Legaspi, and in the evening through deep mud to the alcalde\r\nat Albay. We were now (June) in the middle of the so-called dry season,\r\nbut it rained almost every day; and the road between Albay and Legaspi\r\nwas worse than ever. During my visit information arrived from the\r\ncommandant of the faluas on the south coast that, as he was pursuing\r\ntwo pirate vessels, [Power of Moro pirates.] six others suddenly made\r\ntheir appearance, in order to cut off his return; for which reason he\r\nbad quickly made his way back. The faluas are very strongly manned, and\r\nprovided with cannon, but the crews furnished by the localities on the\r\ncoast are entirely unpractised in the use of fire-arms, and moreover\r\nhold the Moros in such dread that, if the smallest chance offers of\r\nflight, they avail themselves of it to ensure their safety by making\r\nfor the land. The places on the coast, destitute of other arms than\r\nwooden pikes, were completely exposed to the pirates, who had firmly\r\nestablished themselves in Catanduanes, Biri, and several small islands,\r\nand seized ships with impunity, or robbed men on the land. Almost daily\r\nfresh robberies and murders were announced from the villages on the\r\nshore. During a plundering expedition the men caught are employed at\r\nthe oars and at its close sold as slaves; and, on the division of the\r\nspoil, one of the crew falls to the share of the dato (Moro chief) who\r\nfitted out the vessel. [155] The coasting vessels in these waters, it\r\nis true, are mostly provided with artillery, but it is generally placed\r\nin the hold of the ship, as no one on board knows how to use it. If\r\nthe cannon be upon deck, either the powder or the shot is wanting;\r\nand the captain promises to be better prepared next time. [156] The\r\nalcalde reported the outrages of the pirates by every post to Manila,\r\nas well as the great injury done to trade, and spoke of the duty of the\r\n[No protection from Government.] Government to protect its subjects,\r\nespecially as the latter were not permitted to use fire-arms; [157] and\r\nfrom the Bisayan Islands came the same cry for help. The Government,\r\nhowever, was powerless against the evil. If the complaints were indeed\r\nvery urgent, they would send a steamer into the waters most infested;\r\nbut it hardly ever came in sight of pirates, although the latter were\r\ncarrying on their depredations close in front and behind.\r\n\r\n[Government steamer easily eluded.] At Samars, the principal town,\r\nI subsequently met with a Government steamer, which for fourteen days\r\npast had been nominally engaged in cruising against the pirates; but\r\nthe latter, generally forewarned by their spies, perceive the smoke\r\nof the steamers sufficiently soon to slip away in their flat boats;\r\nand the officers knew beforehand that their cruise would have no\r\nother result than to show the distressed provinces that their outcry\r\nwas not altogether unnoticed. [158]\r\n\r\n[Steam gunboats more successful.] Twenty small steam gunboats of light\r\ndraught had shortly before been ordered from England, and were nearly\r\nready. The first two indeed arrived soon after in Manila (they had to\r\nbe transported in pieces round the Cape), and were to be followed by\r\nthe rest; and they were at one time almost successful in delivering\r\nthe archipelago from these burdensome pests; [159] at least, from\r\nthe proscribed Moros who came every year from the Sulu Sea, mostly\r\nfrom the island of Tawitawi, arriving in May at the Bisayas, and\r\ncontinuing their depredations in the archipelago until the change\r\nof the monsoon in October or November compelled them to return.\r\n[160] [Renegades join pirates and bandits.] In the Philippines they\r\ngained new recruits among vagabonds, deserters, runaway criminals,\r\nand ruined spendthrifts; and from the same sources were made up the\r\nbands of highway robbers (tulisanes), which sometimes started up,\r\nand perpetuated acts of extraordinary daring. Not long before my\r\narrival they had made an inroad into a suburb of Manila, and engaged\r\nwith the military in the highways. Some of the latter are regularly\r\nemployed in the service against the tulisanes. The robbers are not,\r\nas a rule, cruel to their victims when no opposition is offered.  [161]\r\n\r\n[Plants from Berlin.] In Legaspi I found awaiting me several chests\r\nwith tin lining, which had been sixteen months on their passage by\r\noverland route, instead of seven weeks, having been conveyed from\r\nBerlin by way of Trieste, on account of the Italian war. Their\r\ncontents, which had been intended for use in the Philippines\r\nexclusively, were now for the most part useless. In one chest there\r\nwere two small flasks with glass stoppers, one filled with moist\r\ncharcoal, and the other with moist clay, both containing seeds of the\r\nVictoria Regia and tubers of red and blue nymphae (water-lily). Those\r\nin the first flask were spoiled, as might have been expected; but in\r\nthat filled with moist clay two tubers had thrown out shoots of half an\r\ninch in length, and appeared quite sound. I planted them at once, and\r\nin a few days vigorous leaves were developed. One of these beautiful\r\nplants, which had been originally intended for the Buitenzorg Garden\r\nin Java, remained in Legaspi; the other I sent to Manila, where,\r\non my return, I saw it in full bloom. In the charcoal two Victoria\r\nseeds had thrown out roots above an inch in length, which had rotted\r\noff. Most likely they had been torn up by the custom-house inspectors,\r\nand had afterwards rotted, for the neck of the bottle was broken,\r\nand the charcoal appeared as if it had been stirred. I communicated\r\nthe brilliant result of his mode of packing to the Inspector of the\r\nBotanical Gardens at Berlin, who made a second consignment direct\r\nto Java, which arrived in the best condition; so that not only the\r\nVictoria, but also the one which had been derived in Berlin from an\r\nAfrican father and an Asiatic mother, now adorn the water-basins of\r\nJava with red pond-roses (the latter plants probably those of the\r\nPhilippines also).\r\n\r\n[Carpentering difficulties.] Being compelled by the continuous rain to\r\ndry my collections in two ovens before packing them, I found that my\r\nservant had burned the greater part, so that the remains found a place\r\nin a roomy chest which I purchased for a dollar at an auction. This\r\nunfortunately lacked a lid; to procure which I was obliged, in the\r\nfirst place, to liberate a carpenter who had been imprisoned for a\r\nsmall debt; secondly, to advance money for the purchase of a board\r\nand the redemption of his tools out of pawn; and even then the work,\r\nwhen it was begun, was several times broken off because previous claims\r\nof violent creditors had to be discharged by labor. In five days the\r\nlid was completed, at the cost of three dollars. It did not last long,\r\nhowever, for in Manila I had to get it replaced by a new one.\r\n\r\n[Off to Samar.] At Legaspi I availed myself of an opportunity to reach\r\nthe island of Samar in a small schooner. It is situated south-east\r\nfrom Luzon, on the farther side of the Strait of San Bernardino,\r\nwhich is three leagues in breadth. At the moment of my departure,\r\nto my great regret, my servant left me, \"that he might rest a little\r\nfrom his fatigue,\" for Pepe was good-natured, very skilful, and\r\nalways even-tempered. [Losing a clever assistant.] He had learned\r\nmuch from the numerous Spanish soldiers and sailors resident in\r\nCavite, his native place, where he used to be playfully called the\r\n\"Spaniard of Cavite.\" Roving from one place to another was his\r\ndelight; and he quickly acquired acquaintances. He knew especially\r\nhow to gain the favor of the ladies, for he possessed many social\r\naccomplishments, being equally able to play the guitar and to milk\r\nthe carabao-cows. When we came to a pueblo, where a mestiza, or even a\r\n\"daughter of the country\" (creole), dwelt, he would, when practicable,\r\nask permission to milk a cow; and after bringing the señora some\r\nof the milk, under pretext of being the interpreter of my wishes,\r\nhe would maintain such a flow of ingeniously courteous conversation,\r\npraising the beauty and grace of the lady, and most modestly allowing\r\nhis prodigious travelling adventures to be extracted from him, that\r\nboth knight and esquire beamed with brilliant radiance. A present\r\nwas always welcome, and brought us many a little basket of oranges;\r\nand carabao milk is excellent with chocolate: but it seemed as if\r\none seldom has the opportunity of milking a cow. Unfortunately Pepe\r\ndid not like climbing mountains, and when he was to have gone with\r\nme he either got the stomach-ache or gave away my strong shoes, or\r\nallowed them to be stolen; the native ones, however, being allowed\r\nto remain untouched, for he knew well that they were fit only for\r\nriding, and derived comfort from the fact. In company with me he\r\nworked quickly and cheerfully; but, when alone, it became tedious to\r\nhim. Particularly he found friends, who hindered him, and then he would\r\nabandon his skinning of the birds, which therefore became putrid and\r\nhad to be thrown away. Packing was still more disagreeable to him, and\r\nconsequently he did it as quickly as possible, though not always with\r\nsufficient care, as on one occasion he tied up, in one and the same\r\nbundle, shoes, arsenic-soap, drawings, and chocolate. Notwithstanding\r\ntrifling faults of this kind, he was very useful and agreeable to me;\r\nbut he did not go willingly to such an uncivilized island as Samar;\r\nand when he received his wages in full for eight months all in a lump,\r\nand so became a small capitalist, he could not resist the temptation\r\nto rest a little from his labors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n[Samar.] The island of Samar, which is of nearly rhomboidal outline,\r\nand with few indentations on its coasts, stretches from the north-west\r\nto the south-east from 12° 37' to 10° 54' N.; its mean length being\r\ntwenty-two miles, its breadth eleven, and its area two hundred and\r\ntwenty square miles. It is separated on the south by the small strait\r\nof San Juanico from the island of Leyte, with which it was formerly\r\nunited into one province. At the present time each island has its\r\nseparate governor.\r\n\r\n[Former names.] By the older authors the island is called Tendaya,\r\nIbabao, and also Achan and Filipina. In later times the eastern\r\nside was called Ibabao, and the western Samar, which is now the\r\nofficial denomination for the whole island, the eastern shore being\r\ndistinguished as the Contracosta. [162]\r\n\r\n[Seasons and weather.] As on the eastern coasts of Luzon, the\r\nnorth-east monsoon here exceeds that from the south-west in duration\r\nand force, the violence of the latter being arrested by the islands\r\nlying to the southwest, while the north-east winds break against\r\nthe coasts of these easterly islands with their whole force, and the\r\nadditional weight of the body of water which they bring with them from\r\nthe open ocean. In October winds fluctuating between north-west and\r\nnorth-east occur; but the prevalent ones are northerly. In the middle\r\nof November the north-east is constant; and it blows, with but little\r\nintermission, from the north until April. This is likewise the rainy\r\nseason, December and January being the wettest, when it sometimes\r\nrains for fourteen days without interruption. In Lauang, on the north\r\ncoast, the rainy season lasts from October to the end of December. From\r\nJanuary to April it is dry; May, June, and July are rainy; and August\r\nand September, again, are dry; so that here there are two wet and\r\ntwo dry seasons in the year. From October to January violent storms\r\n(baguios or typhoons) sometimes occur. Beginning generally with a\r\nnorth wind, they pass to the north-west, accompanied by a little rain,\r\nthen back to the north, and with increasing violence to the north-east\r\nand east, where they acquire their greatest power, and then moderate\r\nto the south. Sometimes, however, they change rapidly from the east\r\nto the south, in which quarter they first acquire their greatest force.\r\n\r\n[Winds and storms.] From the end of March to the middle of June\r\ninconstant easterly winds (N.E.E. and S.E.) prevail, with a very\r\nheavy sea on the east coast. May is usually calm; but in May and\r\nJune there are frequent thunderstorms, introducing the south-west\r\nmonsoon, which though it extends through the months of July, August,\r\nand September, is not so constant as the north-east. The last-named\r\nthree months constitute the dry season, which, however, is often\r\ninterrupted by thunderstorms. Not a week, indeed, passes without rain;\r\nand in many years a storm arises every afternoon. At this season of\r\nthe year ships can reach the east coast; but during the north-east\r\nmonsoon navigation there is impossible. These general circumstances\r\nare subject to many local deviations, particularly on the south and\r\nwest coasts, where the uniformity of the air currents is disturbed\r\nby the mountainous islands lying in front of them. According to\r\nthe Estado geografico of 1855, an extraordinarily high tide, called\r\ndolo, occurs every year at the change of the monsoon in September or\r\nOctober. It rises sometimes sixty or seventy feet, and dashes itself\r\nwith fearful violence against the south and east coasts, doing great\r\ndamage, but not lasting for any length of time. The climate of Samar\r\nand Leyte appears to be very healthy on the coasts; in fact, to be\r\nthe best of all the islands of the archipelago. Dysentery, diarrhoea,\r\nand fever occur less frequently than in Luzon, and Europeans also\r\nare less subject to their attacks than in that place.\r\n\r\n[Only the coast settled.] The civilized natives live almost solely\r\non its coasts, and there are also Bisayans who differ in speech and\r\nmanners from the Bicols in about the same degree that the latter do\r\nfrom the Tagalogs. Roads and villages are almost entirely wanting\r\nin the interior, which is covered with a thick wood, and affords\r\nsustenance to independent tribes, who carry on a little tillage\r\n(vegetable roots and mountain rice), and collect the products of the\r\nwoods, particularly resin, honey, and wax, in which the island is\r\nvery rich.\r\n\r\n[A tedious but eventful voyage.] On the 3rd of July we lost sight\r\nof Legaspi, and, detained by frequent calms, crawled as far as\r\nPoint Montufar, on the northern edge of Albay, then onwards to the\r\nsmall island of Viri, and did not reach Lauang before evening of\r\nthe 5th. The mountain range of Bacon (the Pocdol of Coello), which\r\non my previous journeys had been concealed by night or mist, now\r\nrevealed itself to us in passing as a conical mountain; and beside\r\nit towered a very precipitous, deeply-cleft mountain-side, apparently\r\nthe remnant of a circular range. After the pilot, an old Filipino and\r\nnative of the country, who had made the journey frequently before,\r\nhad conducted us, to begin with, to a wrong port, he ran the vessel\r\nfast on to the bar, although there was sufficient water to sail into\r\nthe harbor conveniently.\r\n\r\n[Lauang.] The district of Lauang (Lahuan), which is encumbered with\r\nmore than four thousand five hundred inhabitants, is situated at an\r\naltitude of forty feet, on the south-west shore of the small island\r\nof the same name, which is separated from Samar by an arm of the\r\nCatubig. According to a widely-spread tradition, the settlement was\r\noriginally in Samar itself, in the middle of the rice-fields, which\r\ncontinue to the present day in that place, until the repeated inroads\r\nof sea-pirates drove the inhabitants, in spite of the inconvenience\r\nattending it, to protect themselves by settling on the south coast\r\nof the little island, which rises steeply out of the sea. [163] The\r\nlatter consists of almost horizontal banks of tufa, from eight to\r\ntwelve inches in thickness. The strata being continually eaten away\r\nby the waves at low watermark, the upper layers break off; and thus\r\nthe uppermost parts of the strata, which are of a tolerably uniform\r\nthickness, are cleft by vertical fissures, and look like the walls of\r\na fortress. Pressed for space, the church and the convent have taken\r\nup every level bit of the rock at various heights; and the effect of\r\nthis accommodation of architecture to the requirements of the ground,\r\nthough not designed by the architect, is most picturesque.\r\n\r\n[Deterioration in the town.] The place is beautifully situated; but the\r\nhouses are not so frequently as formerly surrounded by little gardens\r\nwhile there is a great want of water, and foul odors prevail. Two or\r\nthree scanty springs afford a muddy, brackish water, almost at the\r\nlevel of the sea, with which the indolent people are content so that\r\nthey have just enough. Wealthy people have their water brought from\r\nSamar, and the poorer classes are sometimes compelled, by the drying-up\r\nof the springs, to have recourse to the same place. The spring-water\r\nis not plentiful for bathing purposes; and, sea-bathing not being in\r\nfavor, the people consequently are very dirty. Their clothing is the\r\nsame as in Luzon; but the women wear no tapis, only a camisa (a short\r\nchemise, hardly covering the breast), and a saya, mostly of coarse,\r\nstiff guinara, which forms ugly folds, and when not colored black\r\nis very transparent. But dirt and a filthy existence form a better\r\nscreen than opaque garments. The inhabitants of Lauang rightly,\r\nindeed, enjoy the reputation of being very idle. Their industry is\r\nlimited to a little tillage, even fishing being so neglected that\r\nfrequently there is a scarcity of fish. In the absence of roads by\r\nland, there is hardly any communication by water; and trade is mostly\r\ncarried on by mariners from Catbalogan, who exchange the surplus of\r\nthe harvests for other produce.\r\n\r\nFrom the convent a view is had of part of the island of Samar, the\r\nmountain forms of which appear to be a continuation of the horizontal\r\nstrata. In the centre of the district, at the distance of some miles,\r\na table mountain, famous in the history of the country, towers\r\naloft. [The Palapat revolt.] The natives of the neighboring village\r\nof Palapat retreated to it after having killed their priest, a too\r\ncovetous Jesuit father, and for years carried on a guerilla warfare\r\nwith the Spaniards until they were finally overpowered by treachery.\r\n\r\n[Pirate outrages.] The interior of the country is difficult to\r\ntraverse from the absence of roads, and the coasts are much infested\r\nby pirates. Quite recently several pontins and four schooners,\r\nladen with abacá, were captured, and the crews cruelly murdered,\r\ntheir bodies having been cut to pieces. This, however, was opposed\r\nto their general practice, for the captives are usually employed at\r\nthe oars during the continuance of the foray, and afterwards sold as\r\nslaves in the islands of the Sulu sea. It was well that we did not\r\nencounter the pirates, for, although we carried four small cannons\r\non board, nobody understood how to use them. [164]\r\n\r\n[Electing officers.]  The governor, who was expected to conduct the\r\nelection of the district officials in person, but was prevented\r\nby illness, sent a deputy. As the annual elections are conducted\r\nin the same manner over the whole country, that at which I was\r\npresent may be taken as typical of the rest. It took place in the\r\ncommon hall; the governor (or his deputy) sitting at the table,\r\nwith the pastor on his right hand, and the clerk on his left--the\r\nlatter also acting as interpreter; while Cabezas de Barangay, the\r\ngobernadorcillo, and those who had previously filled the office, took\r\ntheir places all together on benches. First of all, six cabezas and\r\nas many gobernadorcillos are chosen by lot as electors; the actual\r\ngobernadorcillo is the thirteenth, and the rest quit the hall. After\r\nthe reading of the statutes by the president, who exhorts the electors\r\nto the conscientious performance of their duty, the latter advance\r\nsingly to the table, and write three names on a piece of paper. Unless\r\na valid protest be made either by the parish priest or by the electors,\r\nthe one who has the most votes is forthwith named gobernadorcillo for\r\nthe coming year, subject to the approval of the superior jurisdiction\r\nat Manila; which, however, always consents, for the influence of the\r\npriest would provide against a disagreeable election. The election of\r\nthe other functionaries takes place in the same manner, after the new\r\ngobernadorcillo has been first summoned into the hall, in order that,\r\nif he have any important objections to the officers then about to be\r\nelected, he may be able to make them. The whole affair was conducted\r\nvery quietly and with dignity. [165]\r\n\r\n[Unsatisfactory forced labor.] On the following morning, accompanied\r\nby the obliging priest, who was followed by nearly all the boys\r\nof the village, I crossed over in a large boat to Samar. Out of\r\neleven strong baggage porters whom the governor's representative had\r\nselected for me, four took possession of some trifling articles and\r\nsped away with them, three others hid themselves in the bush, and\r\nfour had previously decamped at Lauang. The baggage was divided and\r\ndistributed amongst the four porters who were detained, and the little\r\nboys who had accompanied us for their own pleasure. We followed the\r\nsea-shore in a westerly direction, and at a very late hour reached the\r\nnearest visita (a suburban chapel and settlement) where the priest\r\nwas successful, after much difficulty, in supplying the places of\r\nthe missing porters. On the west side of the mouth of the Pambujan\r\na neck of land projects into the sea, which is a favorite resort\r\nof the [A pirate base.] sea-pirates, who from their shelter in the\r\nwood command the shore which extends in a wide curve on both sides,\r\nand forms the only communication between Lauang and Catarman. Many\r\ntravellers had already been robbed in this place; and the father, who\r\nwas now accompanying me thus far, had, with the greatest difficulty,\r\nescaped the same danger only a few weeks before.\r\n\r\nThe last part of our day's journey was performed very cautiously. A\r\nmessenger who had been sent on had placed boats at all the mouths of\r\nrivers, and, as hardly any other Europeans besides ecclesiastics are\r\nknown in this district, I was taken in the darkness for a Capuchin in\r\ntravelling attire; the men lighting me with torches during the passage,\r\nand the women pressing forward to kiss my hand. I passed the night\r\non the road, and on the following day reached Catarman (Caladman on\r\nCoello's map), a clean, spacious locality numbering 6,358 souls, at\r\nthe mouth of the river of the same name. Six pontins from Catbalogan\r\nawaited their cargoes of rice for Albay. The inhabitants of the north\r\ncoast are too indifferent sailors to export their products themselves,\r\nand leave it to the people of [Catbalogan monopoly of interisland\r\ntraffic.] Catbalogan, who, having no rice-fields, are obliged to find\r\nemployment for their activity in other places.\r\n\r\n[A changed river and a new town.] The river Catarman formerly emptied\r\nfurther to the east, and was much choked with mud. In the year 1851,\r\nafter a continuous heavy rain, it worked for itself, in the loose\r\nsoil which consists of quartz sand and fragments of mussels, a new\r\nand shorter passage to the sea--the present harbor, in which ships\r\nof two hundred tons can load close to the land; but in doing so it\r\ndestroyed the greater part of the village, as well as the stone church\r\nand the priest's residence. In the new convent there are two salons,\r\none 16.2 by 8.8, the other 9 by 7.6 paces in dimensions, boarded with\r\nplanks from a single branch of a dipterocarpus (guiso). The pace is\r\nequivalent to 30 inches; and, assuming the thickness of the boards,\r\ninclusive of waste, to be one inch, this would give a solid block of\r\nwood as high as a table (two and one-half feet), the same in breadth,\r\neighteen feet in length, and of about one hundred and ten cubic\r\nfeet. [166] The houses are enclosed in gardens; but some of them only\r\nby fencing, within which weeds luxuriate. At the rebuilding of the\r\nvillage, after the great flood of water, the laying out of gardens\r\nwas commanded; but the industry which is required to preserve them is\r\noften wanting. Pasture grounds extend themselves, on the south side\r\nof the village, covered with fine short grass; but, with the exception\r\nof some oxen and sheep belonging to the priest, there are no cattle.\r\n\r\n[Up the river.] Still without servants, I proceeded with my baggage in\r\ntwo small boats up the river, on both sides of which rice-fields and\r\ncoco-groves extended; but the latter, being concealed by a thick border\r\nof Nipa palms and lofty cane, are only visible occasionally through\r\nthe gaps. The sandy banks, at first flat, became gradually steeper,\r\nand the rock soon showed itself close at hand, with firm banks of sandy\r\nclay containing occasional traces of indistinguishable petrifactions. A\r\nsmall mussel [167] has pierced the clay banks at the water-line, in\r\nsuch number that they look like honeycombs. About twelve we cooked\r\nour rice in an isolated hut, amongst friendly people. The women whom\r\nwe surprised in dark ragged clothing of guinara drew back ashamed,\r\nand soon after appeared in clean chequered sayas, with earrings of\r\nbrass and tortoise-shell combs. When I drew a little naked girl, the\r\nmother forced her to put on a garment. About two we again stepped into\r\nthe boat, and after rowing the whole night reached a small visita,\r\nCobocobo, about nine in the forenoon. The rowers had worked without\r\ninterruption for twenty-four hours, exclusive of the two hours'\r\nrest at noon, and though somewhat tired were in good spirits.\r\n\r\n[Salta Sangley ridge.] At half-past two we set out on the road over\r\nthe Salta Sangley (Chinese leap) to Tragbucan, which, distant about a\r\nmile in a straight line, is situated at the place where the Calbayot,\r\nwhich empties on the west coast at Point Hibaton, becomes navigable for\r\nsmall boats. By means of these two rivers and the short but troublesome\r\nroad, a communication exists between the important stations of Catarman\r\non the north coast, and Calbayot on the west coast. The road, which\r\nat its best part is a small path in the thick wood uninvaded by the\r\nsun, and frequently is only a track, passes over slippery ridges of\r\nclay, disappearing in the mud puddles in the intervening hollows, and\r\nsometimes running into the bed of the brooks. The watershed between\r\nthe Catarman and Calbayot is formed by the Salta Sangley already\r\nmentioned, a flat ridge composed of banks of clay and sandstone,\r\nwhich succeed one another ladder-wise downwards on both its sides,\r\nand from which the water collected at the top descends in little\r\ncascades. In the most difficult places rough ladders of bamboo are\r\nfixed. I counted fifteen brooks on the north-east side which feed the\r\nCatarman, and about the same number of feeders of the Calbayot on the\r\nsouth-west side. About forty minutes past four we reached the highest\r\npoint of the Salta Sangley, about ninety feet above the sea; and at\r\nhalf-past six we got to a stream, the highest part of the Calbayot,\r\nin the bed of which we wandered until its increasing depth forced us,\r\nin the dark, laboriously to beat out our path through the underwood\r\nto its bank; and about eight o'clock we found ourselves opposite the\r\nvisita Tragbucan. The river at this place was already six feet deep,\r\nand there was not a boat. After shouting entreaties and threats for\r\na long time, the people, who were startled out of sleep by a revolver\r\nshot, agreed to construct a raft of bamboo, on which they put us and\r\nour baggage. The little place, which consists of only a few poor huts,\r\nis prettily situated, surrounded as it is by wooded hillocks on a\r\nplateau of sand fifty feet above the reed-bordered river.\r\n\r\n[On the Calbayot River.] Thanks to the activity of the teniente of\r\nCatarman who accompanied me, a boat was procured without delay, so\r\nthat we were able to continue our journey about seven o'clock. The\r\nbanks were from twenty to forty feet high; and, with the exception of\r\nthe cry of some rhinoceros birds which fluttered from bough to bough\r\non the tops of the trees, we neither heard nor saw a trace of animal\r\nlife. About half-past eleven we reached Taibago, a small visita,\r\nand about half-past one a similar one, Magubay; and after two hours'\r\nrest at noon, about five o'clock, we got into a current down which\r\nwe skilfully floated, almost without admitting any water. The river,\r\nwhich up to this point is thirty feet broad, and on account of many\r\nprojecting branches of trees difficult to navigate, here is twice as\r\nbroad. About eleven at night we reached the sea, and in a complete\r\ncalm rowed for the distance of a league along the coast to Calbayot,\r\nthe convent at which place affords a commanding view of the islands\r\nlying before it.\r\n\r\nA thunderstorm obliged us to postpone the journey to the chief town,\r\nCatbalogan (or Catbalonga), which was seven leagues distant, until\r\nthe afternoon. In a long boat, formed out of the stem of one tree,\r\nand furnished with outriggers, we travelled along the shore, which\r\nis margined by a row of low-wooded hills with many small visitas;\r\nand as night was setting in we rounded the point of Napalisan,\r\na rock of trachytic conglomerate shaped by perpendicular fissures\r\nwith rounded edges into a series of projections like towers,\r\nwhich rises up out of the sea to the height of sixty feet, like\r\na knight's castle. [Catbalogan.] At night we reached Catbalogan,\r\nthe chief town of the island, with a population of six thousand,\r\nwhich is picturesquely situated in the middle of the western border,\r\nin a little bay surrounded by islands and necks of land, difficult\r\nto approach and, therefore, little guarded. Not a single vessel was\r\nanchored in the harbor.\r\n\r\nThe houses, many of which are of boards, are neater than those\r\nin Camarines; and the people, though idle, are more modest, more\r\nhonorable, more obliging, and of cleaner habits, than the inhabitants\r\nof South Luzon. Through the courtesy of the governor I quickly obtained\r\na roomy dwelling, and a servant who understood Spanish. [An ingenious\r\nmechanic.] Here I also met a very intelligent Filipino who had acquired\r\ngreat skill in a large variety of crafts. With the simplest tools he\r\nimproved in many points on my instruments and apparatus, the purpose\r\nof which he quickly comprehended to my entire satisfaction, and gave\r\nmany proofs of considerable intellectual ability.\r\n\r\n[The flying monkey.] In Samar the flying monkey or lemur (the kaguang\r\nof the Bisayans--galeopithecus) is not rare. These animals, which are\r\nof the size of the domestic cat, belong to the quadrumana; but, like\r\nthe flying squirrels, they are provided with a bird-like membrane,\r\nwhich, commencing at the neck, and passing over the fore and hinder\r\nlimbs, reaches to the tail; by means of which they are able to glide\r\nfrom one tree to another at a very obtuse angle. [168] Body and\r\nmembrane are clothed with a very short fur, which nearly equals the\r\nchinchilla in firmness and softness, and is on that account in great\r\nrequest. While I was there, six live kaguangs arrived as a present for\r\nthe priest (three light grey, one dark brown, and two greyish brown;\r\nall with irregularly distributed spots); and from these I secured a\r\nlittle female with her young.\r\n\r\n[A hasty and unfounded judgment.] It appeared to be a very harmless,\r\nawkward animal. When liberated from its fetters, it remained lying\r\non the ground with all its four limbs stretched out, and its belly\r\nin contact with the earth, and then hopped in short awkward leaps,\r\nwithout thereby raising itself from the ground, to the nearest wall,\r\nwhich was of planed boards. Arrived there, it felt about it for a long\r\ntime with the sharp claw, which is bent inwards, of its fore-hand,\r\nuntil at length it realized the impossiblity of climbing it at any\r\npart. It succeeded by means of a corner or an accidental crevice in\r\nclimbing a foot upwards, and fell down again immediately, because it\r\nhad abandoned the comparatively secure footing of its hinder limbs\r\nbefore its fore-claws had obtained a firm hold. It received no hurt,\r\nas the violence of the fall was broken by the flying membrane which\r\nwas rapidly extended. These attempts, which were continued with steady\r\nperseverance, showed an astonishing deficiency of judgment, the animal\r\nendeavoring to do much more than was in its power to accomplish. All\r\nits endeavors, therefore, were unsuccessful, though made without\r\ndoing itself any hurt--thanks to the parachute with which Nature\r\nhad provided it. Had the kaguang not been in the habit of relying\r\nso entirely on this convenient contrivance, it probably would have\r\nexercised its judgment to a greater extent, and formed a more correct\r\nestimate of its ability. The animal repeated its fruitless efforts so\r\noften that I no longer took any notice of it, and after some time it\r\ndisappeared: but I found it again in a dark corner, under the roof,\r\nwhere it would probably have waited for the night in order to continue\r\nits flight. Evidently it had succeeded in reaching the upper edge of\r\nthe boarded wall by squeezing its body between this and the elastic\r\ncovering of bamboo hurdle-work which lay firmly imposed upon it;\r\nso that the poor creature, which I had rashly concluded was stupid\r\nand awkward, had, under the circumstances, manifested the greatest\r\npossible skill, prudence, and perseverance.\r\n\r\n[A promise of rare animals and wild people.] A priest who was\r\npresent on a visit from Calbigan promised me so many wonders in his\r\ndistrict--abundance of the rarest animals, and Cimarrones uncivilized\r\nin the highest degree--that I accompanied him, on the following day,\r\nin his journey home. In an hour after our departure we reached the\r\nlittle island of Majava, which consists of perpendicular strata of\r\na hard, fine-grained, volcanic tufa, with small, bright crystals of\r\nhornblende. The island of Buat (on Coello's map) is called by our\r\nmariners Tubigan. In three hours we reached Umauas, a dependency\r\nof Calbigan. It is situated, fifty feet above the sea, in a bay,\r\nbefore which (as is so often the case on this coast) a row of small\r\npicturesque islands succeed one another, and is exactly four leagues\r\nfrom Catbalogan. But Calbigan, which we reached towards evening, is\r\nsituated two leagues N.N.E. from Umauas, surrounded by rice-fields,\r\nforty feet above the river of the same name, and almost a league and\r\na half from its mouth. A tree with beautiful violet-blue panicles\r\nof blossoms is especially abundant on the banks of the Calbigan,\r\nand supplies a most valuable wood for building purposes in the\r\nPhilippines. It is considered equal to teak, like which it belongs\r\nto the class verbenaceae; and its inland name is [Molave.] molave\r\n(Vitex geniculata, Blanco).\r\n\r\n[Serpent-charmers.] According to the statements of credible men,\r\nthere are serpent-tamers in this country. They are said to pipe the\r\nserpents out of their holes, directing their movements, and stopping\r\nand handling them at will, without being injured by them. The most\r\nfamous individual amongst them, however, had been carried off by\r\nthe sea-pirates a short time before; another had run away to the\r\nCimarronese in the mountains; and the third, whose reputation did not\r\nappear to be rightly established, accompanied me on my excursion,\r\nbut did not justify the representations of his friends. He caught\r\ntwo poisonous serpents, [169] which we encountered on the road, by\r\ndexterously seizing them immediately behind the head, so that they were\r\nincapable of doing harm; and, when he commanded them to lie still,\r\nhe took the precaution of placing his foot on their necks. In the\r\nchase I hurt my foot so severely against a sharp-pointed branch which\r\nwas concealed by the mud that I was obliged to return to Catbalogan\r\nwithout effecting my object. The inhabitants of Calbigan are considered\r\nmore active and circumspect than those on the west coast, and they are\r\npraised for their honesty. I found them very skilful; and they seemed\r\nto take an evident pleasure in making collections and preparing plants\r\nand animals, so that I would gladly have taken with me a servant from\r\nthe place; but they are so reluctant to leave their village that all\r\nthe priest's efforts to induce one to ride with us were fruitless.\r\n\r\n[A coral garden.] At a short distance north-west from Catbalogan a most\r\nluxuriant garden of corals is to be observed in less than two fathoms,\r\nat the ebb. On a yellow carpet of calcareous polyps and sponges,\r\ngroups of leather-like stalks, finger-thick, lift themselves up like\r\nstems of vegetable growth; their upper ends thickly covered with polyps\r\n(Sarcophyton pulmo Esp.), which display their roses of tentacula wide\r\nopen, and resplendent with the most beautiful varying colors, looking,\r\nin fact, like flowers in full bloom. Very large serpulites extend\r\nfrom their calcareous tubes, elegant red, blue, and yellow crowns of\r\nfeelers, and, while little fishes of marvellously gorgeous color dart\r\nabout in this fairy garden, in their midst luxuriantly grow delicate,\r\nfeathered plumulariae.\r\n\r\n[Ornamental but useless forts.] Bad weather and the flight of my\r\nservant, who had gambled away some money with which he had been\r\nentrusted, at a cock-fight, having detained me some days in the\r\nchief town, I proceeded up the bay, which extends southwards from\r\nCatbalogan and from west to east as far as Paranas. Its northern\r\nshore consists of ridges of earth, regular and of equal height,\r\nextending from north to south, with gentle slopes towards the west,\r\nbut steep declivities on the east, and terminating abruptly towards\r\nthe sea. Nine little villages are situated on this coast between\r\nCatbalogan and Paranas. From the hollows, amidst coco and betel\r\npalms, they expand in isolated groups of houses up the gentle western\r\nslopes, and, on reaching the summit, terminate in a little castle,\r\nwhich hardly affords protection against the pirates, but generally\r\nforms a pretty feature in the landscape. In front of the southern\r\nedge of the bay, and to the south-west, many small islands and wooded\r\nrocks are visible, with the mountains of Leyte in the high-ground,\r\nconstituting an ever-shifting series of views.\r\n\r\n[Paranas.] As the men, owing to the sultry heat, the complete calm,\r\nand almost cloudless sky, slept quite as much as they rowed, we\r\ndid not reach Paranas before the afternoon. It is a clean village,\r\nsituated on a declivity between twenty and a hundred and fifty feet\r\nabove the sea. The sides, which stand perpendicularly in the sea,\r\nconsist of grey banks of clay receding landwards, and overspread\r\nwith a layer of fragments of mussels, the intervals between which\r\nare filled up with clay, and over the latter is a solid breccia,\r\ncemented with lime, composed of similar fragments. In the clay banks\r\nare well-preserved petrifactions, so similar in color, habitat, and\r\naspect to many of those in the German tertiary formations that they\r\nmight be taken for them. The breccia also is fossil, probably also\r\ntertiary; at all events, the identity of the few species which were\r\nrecognisable in it--Cerithium, Pecten, and Venus--with living species\r\ncould not be determined. [170]\r\n\r\n[A canal through the bog.] On the following morning I proceeded\r\nnorthwards by a small canal, through a stinking bog of rhizophora\r\n(mangroves), and then continued my journey on land to Loquilocun,\r\na little village which is situated in the forest. Half-way we passed\r\nthrough a river, twenty feet broad, flowing east to west, with steep\r\nbanks rendered accessible by ladders.\r\n\r\n[Hammock-travelling.] As I still continued lame (wounds in the feet are\r\ndifficult to heal in warm countries), I caused myself to be carried\r\npart of the way in the manner which is customary hereabouts. The\r\ntraveller lies on a loose mat, which is fastened to a bamboo frame,\r\nborne on the shoulders of four robust polistas. About every ten\r\nminutes the bearers are relieved by others. As a protection against\r\nsun and rain, the frame is furnished with a light roof of pandanus.\r\n\r\n[Poor roads.] The roads were pretty nearly as bad as those at the\r\nSalta Sangley; and, with the exception of the sea-shore, which is\r\nsometimes available, there appear to be none better in Samar. After\r\nthree hours we reached the Loquilocun, which, coming from the north,\r\nhere touches its most southerly point, and then flows south-east to\r\nthe great ocean. Through the kind care of the governor, I found two\r\nsmall boats ready, which were propelled with wonderful dexterity by\r\ntwo men squatted at the extreme ends, and [Running the rapids.] glided\r\nbetween the branches of the trees and rocks into the bed of the rapid\r\nmountain torrent. Amidst loud cheers both the boats glided down a\r\ncascade of a foot and a half in height without shipping any water.\r\n\r\n[Loquilocun.] The little village of Loquilocun consists of three\r\ngroups of houses on three hillocks. The inhabitants were very friendly,\r\nmodest, and obliging, and so successful in collecting that the spirits\r\nof wine which I had with me was quickly consumed. In Catbalogan\r\nmy messengers were able with difficulty to procure a few small\r\nflasks. Through the awkward arrangements of a too obliging friend,\r\nmy own stores, having been sent to a wrong address, did not reach\r\nme until some months afterwards; and the palm-wine, which was to be\r\nbought in Samar, was too weak. One or two boats went out daily to fish\r\nfor me; but I obtained only a few specimens, which belonged to almost\r\nas many species and genera. Probably the bad custom of poisoning the\r\nwater in order to kill the fish (the pounded fruit of a Barringtonia\r\nhere being employed for the purpose) is the cause of the river being\r\nso empty of fish.\r\n\r\n[Numerous small streams.] After a few days we left the little place\r\nabout half-past nine in the forenoon, packed closely in two small\r\nboats; and, by seven minutes past one when we reached an inhabited\r\nhut in the forest, we had descended more than forty streams of a\r\nfoot and a foot and a half and more in depth. The more important of\r\nthem have names which are correctly given on Coello's map; and the\r\nfollowing are their distances by the watch:--At ten o'clock we came\r\nto a narrow, rocky chasm, at the extremity of which the water falls\r\nseveral feet below into a large basin; and here we unloaded the boats,\r\nwhich hitherto had, under skilful management, wound their way, like\r\nwell-trained horses, between all the impediments in the bed of the\r\nriver and over all the cascades and waves, almost without taking any\r\nwater; only two men remaining in each boat, who, loudly cheering,\r\nshot downwards; in doing which the boats were filled to the brim.\r\n\r\n[Jasper and Coal.] Opposite this waterfall a bank of rubbish had been\r\nformed by the alluvium, in which, besides fragments of the subjacent\r\nrock, were found well-rounded pieces of jasper and porphyry, as well\r\nas some bits of coal containing several pyrites, which had probably\r\nbeen brought during the rain from higher up the river. Its origin was\r\nunknown to the sailors. From fifty-six minutes past eleven to twelve\r\no'clock there was an uninterrupted succession of rapids, which were\r\npassed with the greatest dexterity, without taking in water. Somewhat\r\nlower down, at about three minutes past twelve, we took in so much\r\nwater that we were compelled to land and bale it out. At about fifteen\r\nminutes past twelve, we proceeded onwards, the river now being on\r\nthe average sixty feet broad. On the edge of the wood some slender\r\npalms, hardly ten feet high, were remarkable by their frequency,\r\nand many phalaenopses by their display of blossoms, which is of\r\nrare occurrence. Neither birds nor apes, nor serpents were observed;\r\nbut large pythons, as thick as one's leg are said to be not unfrequent.\r\n\r\n[Big pythons.] About thirty-six minutes past twelve we reached one\r\nof the most difficult places--a succession of waves, with many rocks\r\nprojecting out of the water, between which the boats, now in full\r\ncareer, and with rapid evolutions, glided successfully. The adventure\r\nwas accomplished with equal skill by the two crews, who exerted their\r\npowers to the utmost. At seventeen minutes past one we arrived at\r\n[Dini portage.] Dini, the most considerable waterfall in the whole\r\ndistance; and here we had to take the boats out of the water; and,\r\navailing ourselves of the lianas which hung down from the lofty forest\r\ntrees like ropes, we dragged them over the rocks. At twenty-one minutes\r\npast two we resumed our journey; and from twenty-two minutes past to\r\nhalf past eight we descended an irregular stair composed of several\r\nledges, shipping much water. Up to this point the Loquilocun flowed in\r\na rocky bed, with (for the most part) steep banks, and sometimes for\r\na long distance under a thick canopy of boughs, from which powerful\r\ntendrils and ferns, more than a fathom in length, were suspended. Here\r\nthe country was to some extent open; flat hillocks, with low underwood,\r\ncame to view, and, on the north-west, loftier wooded mountains. The\r\nlast two hours were notable for a heavy fall of rain, and, about half\r\npast five, we reached a solitary house occupied by friendly people,\r\nwhere we took up our quarters for the night.\r\n\r\n[Down the river.] On the following morning the journey was continued\r\ndown the river. Within ten minutes we glided past the last waterfall,\r\nbetween white calcareous rocks of a kind of marble, covered with\r\nmagnificent vegetation. Branches, completely covered with phalaenopses\r\n(P. Aphrodite, Reichb. fls.), projected over the river, their flowers\r\nwaving like large gorgeous butterflies over its foaming current. Two\r\nhours later the stream became two hundred feet broad, and, after\r\nleaping down a ladder of fifty meters in height from Loquilocun,\r\nit steals away in gentle windings through a flat inundated country\r\nto the east coast; forming a broad estuary, on the right bank of\r\nwhich, half a league from the sea, the district of Jubasan or Paric\r\n(population 2,300) is situated. The latter give their names to the\r\nlower portion of the stream. Here the excellent fellows of Loquilocun\r\nleft me in order to begin their very arduous return journey.\r\n\r\n[Along the coast.] Owing to bad weather, I could not embark for Tubig\r\n(population 2,858), south of Paric, before the following day; and,\r\nbeing continually hindered by difficulties of land transit, I proceeded\r\nin the rowboat along the coast to Borongan (population 7,685), with\r\nthe equally intelligent and obliging priest with whom I remained\r\nsome days, and then continued my journey to Guiuan (also Guiuang,\r\nGuiguan), the most important district in Samar (population 10,781),\r\nsituated on a small neck of land which projects from the south-east\r\npoint of the island into the sea.\r\n\r\n[A tideland spring.] Close to the shore at the latter place\r\na copious spring bursts out of five or six openings, smelling\r\nslightly of sulphuretted hydrogen. It is covered by the sea during\r\nthe flow, but is open during the ebb, when its salt taste is hardly\r\nperceptible. In order to test the water, a well was formed by sinking\r\na deep bottomless jar, and from this, after the water had flowed for\r\nthe space of half an hour, a sample was taken, which, to my regret,\r\nwas afterwards lost. The temperature of the water of the spring, at\r\neight o'clock in the forenoon, was 27.7°; of the atmosphere, 28.7°;\r\nof the sea-water, 31.2°C. The spring is used by the women to dye\r\ntheir sarongs. The materials, after being steeped in the decoction\r\nof a bark abounding in tannin (materials made of the abacá are first\r\nsoaked in a calcareous preparation), and dried in the sun, are placed\r\nin the spring during the ebb, taken out during the flow, re-dried,\r\ndipped in the decoction of bark, and again, while wet, placed in the\r\nspring; and this is repeated for the space of three days; when the\r\nresult is a durable, but ugly inky black (gallussaures, oxide of iron).\r\n\r\n[East Indian monkeys.] At Loquilocun and Borongan I had an opportunity\r\nof purchasing two live macaques. [171] These extremely delicate\r\nand rare little animals, which belong to the class of semi-apes,\r\nare, as I was assured in Luzon and Leyte, to be found only in\r\nSamar, and live exclusively on charcoal. My first \"mago\" was, in the\r\nbeginning, somewhat voracious, but he disdained vegetable food, and was\r\nparticular in his choice of insects, devouring live grasshoppers with\r\ndelight. [172] It was extremely ludicrous, when he was fed in the day\r\ntime, to see the animal standing, perched up perpendicularly on his two\r\nthin legs with his bare tail, and turning his large head--round as a\r\nball, and with very large, yellow, owl-like eyes--in every direction,\r\nlooking like a dark lantern on a pedestal with a circular swivel. Only\r\ngradually did he succeed in fixing his eyes on the object presented\r\nto him; but, as soon as he did perceive it, he immediately extended\r\nhis little arms sideways, as though somewhat bashful, and then, like\r\na delighted child, suddenly seizing it with hand and mouth at once,\r\nhe deliberately tore the prey to pieces. During the day the mago\r\nwas sleepy, short-sighted, and, when disturbed, morose; but with\r\nthe decreasing daylight he expanded his pupils, and moved about in\r\na lively and agile manner, with rapid noiseless leaps, generally\r\nsideways. He soon became tame, but to my regret died after a few\r\nweeks; and I succeeded only for a short time in keeping the second\r\nlittle animal alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pearl divers from the Carolines.] In Guiuan I was visited by some\r\nMicronesians, who for the last fourteen days had been engaged at\r\nSulangan on the small neck of land south-east from Guiuan, in diving\r\nfor pearl mussels (mother-of-pearl), having undertaken the dangerous\r\njourney for the express purpose. [173]\r\n\r\n[Hardships and perils of their voyage.] They had sailed from Uleai\r\n(Uliai, 7° 20' N., 143°57' E. Gr.) in five boats, each of which had a\r\ncrew of nine men and carried forty gourds full of water, with coconuts\r\nand batata. Every man received one coconut daily, and two batatas,\r\nwhich they baked in the ashes of the coco shells; and they caught\r\nsome fish on the way, and collected a little rain-water. During\r\nthe day they directed their course by the sun, and at night by\r\nthe stars. A storm destroyed the boats. Two of them sank, together\r\nwith their crews, before the eyes of their companions, and of these,\r\nonly one--probably the sole individual rescued--two weeks afterwards\r\nreached the harbor of Tandag, on the east coast of Mindanao. The\r\nparty remained at Tandag two weeks, working in the fields for hire,\r\nand then proceeded northwards along the coast to Cantilang, 8° 25' N.;\r\nBanouan (called erroneously Bancuan by Coello), 9° 1' N.; Taganaan, 9°\r\n25' N.; thence to Surigao, on the north point of Mindanao; and then,\r\nwith an easterly wind, in two days, direct to Guiuan. In the German\r\ntranslation of Captain Salmon's \"History of the Oriental Islands\"\r\n(Altona, 1733), it is stated that:\r\n\r\n[Castaways from the Pelews.] \"Some other islands on the east of\r\nthe Philippines have lately been discovered which have received\r\nthe name of the New Philippines because they are situated in the\r\nneighborhood of the old, which have been already described. Father Clan\r\n(Clain), in a letter from Manila, which has been incorporated in the\r\n'Philosophical Transactions,' makes the following statement respecting\r\nthem:--It happened that when he was in the town of Guivam, on the\r\nisland of Samar, he met twenty-nine Palaos (there had been thirty,\r\nbut one died soon after in Guiuan), or natives of certain recently\r\ndiscovered islands, who had been driven thither by the east winds,\r\nwhich prevail from December to May. According to their own statement,\r\nthey were driven about by the winds for seventy days, without getting\r\nsight of land, until they arrived opposite to Guivam. When they\r\nsailed from their own country, their two boats were quite full,\r\ncarrying thirty-five souls, including their wives and children;\r\nbut several had died miserably on the way from the fatigue which\r\nthey had undergone. When some one from Guivam wished to go on board\r\nto them, they were thrown into such a state of terror that all who\r\nwere in one of the boats sprang overboard, along with their wives\r\nand children. However, they at last thought it best to come into\r\nthe harbor; so they came ashore on December 28, 1696. They fed on\r\ncoconuts and roots, which were charitably supplied to them, but\r\nrefused even to taste cooked rice, which is the general food of the\r\nAsiatic nations. [Previous castaways.] Two women who had previously\r\nbeen cast away on the same islands acted as interpreters for them....\r\n\r\n[Lived by sea-fishing and rain water.] \"The people of the country\r\nwent half naked, and the men painted their bodies with spots and\r\nall kinds of devices.... As long as they were on the sea they lived\r\non fish, which they caught in a certain kind of fish-basket, with a\r\nwide mouth but tapering to a point at the bottom, which was dragged\r\nalong underneath the boats; and rain-water, when they could catch it\r\n(or, as is stated in the letter itself, preserved in the shells of the\r\ncoconut), served them for drink. When they were about to be taken into\r\nthe presence of the Father, whom, from the great respect which was\r\nshown to him, they took for the governor, they colored their bodies\r\nentirely yellow, an operation which they considered highly important,\r\nas enabling them to appear as persons of consideration. They are very\r\nskilful divers, and now and then find pearls in the mussels which\r\nthey bring up, which, however, they throw away as useless things.\"\r\n\r\n[Not the first time for one.] But one of the most important parts of\r\nFather Clain's letter has been omitted by Capt. Salmon:--\"The oldest\r\nof these strangers had once before been cast away on the coast of\r\nthe province of Caragan, on one of our islands (Mindanao); but as he\r\nfound only heathens (infidels), who lived in the mountains or on the\r\ndesert shore, he returned to his own country.\"\r\n\r\n[Yap camotes from Philippines.] In a letter from Father Cantova to\r\nFather d'Aubenton, dated from Agdana (i.e. Agaña, of the Marianne\r\nIslands), March 20, 1722, describing the Caroline and Pelew Islands,\r\nit is said:--\"The fourth district lies to the west. Yap (9° 25' N.,\r\n138° 1' E. Gr.), [174] which is the principal island, is more than\r\nforty leagues in circumference. Besides the different roots which\r\nare used by the natives of the island instead of bread, there is the\r\nbatata, which they call camote, and which they have acquired from\r\nthe Philippines, as I was informed by one of our Caroline Indians,\r\nwho is a native of the island. He states that his father, named\r\nCoorr, ... three of his brothers, and himself had been cast away in\r\na storm on one of the provinces in the Philippines, which was called\r\nBisayas; that a missionary of our society (Jesus) received them in a\r\nfriendly manner ... that on returning to their own island they took\r\nwith them the seeds of different plants, amongst others the [Other\r\narrivals of Micronesians.] batata, which multiplied so fast that they\r\nhad sufficient to supply the other islands of the Archipelago with\r\nthem.\" Murillo Velarde states that in 1708 some Palaos were wrecked\r\nin a storm on Palapag (north coast of Samar); and I personally had\r\nthe opportunity, in Manila, of photographing a company of Palaos and\r\nCaroline islanders, who had been the year before cast on the coast of\r\nSamar by foul weather. Apart from the question of their transport,\r\nwhether voluntary or not, these simply were six examples, such\r\nas still occur occasionally, of Micronesians cast up on the shore\r\nof the Philippines; and probably it would not be difficult to find\r\nseveral more; but how often, both before and after the arrival of the\r\nSpaniards, might not vessels from those islands have come within the\r\ninfluence of the north-east storms, and been driven violently on the\r\neast coast of the Philippines without any record of such facts being\r\npreserved? [175] Even as, on the west side of the Archipelago, the\r\ntype of the race seems to have been modified by its long intercourse\r\nwith China, Japan, Lower India, and later with Europe, so likewise may\r\nPolynesian [Possible influence on Filipinos.] influences have operated\r\nin a similar manner on the east side; and the further circumstance\r\nthat the inhabitants of the Ladrones [176] and the Bisayans [177]\r\npossess the art of coloring their teeth black, seems to point to\r\nearly intercourse between the Bisayans and the Polynesians. [178]\r\n\r\n[A futile sea voyage in an open boat.] At Guiuan I embarked on board\r\nan inconveniently cranky, open boat, which was provided with an awning\r\nonly three feet square, for Tacloban, the chief town of Leyte. After\r\nfirst experiencing an uninterrupted calm, we incurred great danger\r\nin a sudden tempest, so that we had to retrace the whole distance\r\nby means of the oars. The passage was very laborious for the crew,\r\nwho were not protected by an awning (temperature in the sun 35° R.,\r\nof the water 25° R. [179]), and lasted thirty-one hours, with few\r\nintermissions; the party voluntarily abridging their intervals of rest\r\nin order to get back quickly to Tacloban, which keeps up an active\r\nintercourse with Manila, and has all the attractions of a luxurious\r\ncity for the men living on the inhospitable eastern coast. [Beauty\r\nof Samar-Leyte strait.]  It is questionable whether the sea anywhere\r\nwashes over a spot of such peculiar beauty as the narrow strait which\r\ndivides Samar from Leyte. On the west it is enclosed by steep banks\r\nof tuff, which tolerate no swamps of mangroves on their borders. There\r\nthe lofty primeval forest approaches in all its sublimity close to the\r\nshore, interrupted only here and there by groves of cocos, in whose\r\nsharply defined shadows solitary huts are to be found; and the steep\r\nhills facing the sea, and numerous small rocky islands, are crowned\r\nwith little castles of blocks of coral. At the eastern entrance of\r\nthe strait the south coast of Samar consists of white limestone,\r\nlike marble, but of quite modern date, which in many places forms\r\nprecipitous cliffs. [180] At Nipa-Nipa, a small hamlet two leagues from\r\nBasey, they project into the sea in a succession of picturesque rocks,\r\nabove one hundred feet in height, which, rounded above like a dome,\r\nthickly covered with vegetation, and corroded at the base by the waters\r\nof the sea, rise out of the waves like gigantic mushrooms. A peculiar\r\natmosphere of enchantment pervades this locality, whose influence upon\r\nthe native mariner must be all the more powerful when, fortunately\r\nescaping from the billows outside and the buffeting of the north-east\r\nwind, he suddenly enters this tranquil place of refuge. No wonder\r\nthat superstitious imagination has peopled the place with spirits.\r\n\r\n[Burial caves.] In the caverns of these rocks the ancient Pintados\r\ninterred the corpses of their heroes and ancestors in well-locked\r\ncoffins, surrounded by those objects which had been held in the highest\r\nregard by them during life. Slaves were also sacrificed by them at\r\ntheir obsequies, in order that they might not be without attendance\r\nin the world of shadows; [181] and the numerous coffins, implements,\r\narms, and trinkets, protected by superstitious terrors, continued to\r\nbe undisturbed for centuries. No boat ventured to cross over without\r\nthe observance of a religious ceremony, derived from heathen times,\r\nto propitiate the spirits of the caverns who were believed to punish\r\nthe omission of it with storm and ship-wreck.\r\n\r\n[Objects destroyed but superstition persists.] About thirty years ago\r\na zealous young ecclesiastic, to whom these heathen practices were an\r\nabomination, determined to extirpate them by the roots. With several\r\nboats well equipped with crosses, banners, pictures of saints, and\r\nall the approved machinery for driving out the Devil, he undertook\r\nthe expedition against the haunted rocks, which were climbed amidst\r\nthe sounds of music, prayers, and the reports of fireworks. A whole\r\npailful of holy water first having been thrown into the cave for the\r\npurpose of confounding the evil spirits, the intrepid priest rushed\r\nin with elevated cross, and was followed by his faithful companions,\r\nwho were fired with his example. A brilliant victory was the reward\r\nof the well-contrived and carefully executed plot. The coffins were\r\nbroken to fragments, the vessels dashed to pieces, and the skeletons\r\nthrown into the sea; and the remaining caverns were stormed with like\r\nresults. The objects of superstition have indeed been annihilated,\r\nbut the superstition itself survives to the present day.\r\n\r\n[Skulls from a rock near Basey.] I subsequently learned from the\r\npriest at Basey that there were still some remains on a rock, and\r\na few days afterwards the worthy man surprised me with several\r\nskulls and a child's coffin, which he had had brought from the\r\nplace. Notwithstanding the great respect in which he was held by his\r\nflock, he had to exert all his powers of persuasion to induce the\r\nboldest of them to engage in so daring an enterprise. A boat manned\r\nby sixteen rowers was fitted out for the purpose; with a smaller crew\r\nthey would not have ventured to undertake the journey. On their return\r\nhome a thunderstorm broke over them, and the sailors, believing it to\r\nbe a punishment for their outrage, were prevented only by the fear\r\nof making the matter worse from throwing coffin and skulls into the\r\nsea. Fortunately the land was near, and they rowed with all their\r\nmight towards it; and, when they arrived, I was obliged to take the\r\nobjects out of the boat myself, as no native would touch them.\r\n\r\n[The cavern's contents.] Notwithstanding, I was the next morning\r\nsuccessful in finding some resolute individuals who accompanied\r\nme to the caverns. In the first two which we examined we found\r\nnothing; the third contained several broken coffins, some skulls,\r\nand potsherds of glazed and crudely painted earthenware, of which,\r\nhowever, it was impossible to find two pieces that belonged to each\r\nother. A narrow hole led from the large cavern into an obscure space,\r\nwhich was so small that one could remain in it only for a few seconds\r\nwith the burning torch. This circumstance may explain the discovery,\r\nin a coffin which was eaten to pieces by worms, and quite mouldered\r\naway, of a well-preserved skeleton, or rather a mummy, for in many\r\nplaces there were carcasses clothed with dry fibers of muscle and\r\nskin. It lay upon a mat of pandanus, which was yet recognizable, with\r\na cushion under the head stuffed with plants, and covered with matting\r\nof pandanus. There were no other remains of woven material. The coffins\r\nwere of three shapes and without any ornament. Those of the first form,\r\nwhich were of excellent molave-wood, showed no trace of worm-holes or\r\ndecay, whereas the others had entirely fallen to dust; and those of\r\nthe third kind, which were most numerous, were distinguishable from\r\nthe first only by a less curved form and inferior material.\r\n\r\n[Impressive location of burial cave.] No legend could have supplied\r\nan enchanted royal sepulchre with a more suitable approach than that\r\nof the last of these caverns. The rock rises out of the sea with\r\nperpendicular sides of marble, and only in one spot is to be observed\r\na natural opening made by the water, hardly two feet high, through\r\nwhich the boat passed at once into a spacious court, almost circular,\r\nand over-arched by the sky, the floor of which was covered by the sea,\r\nand adorned with a garden of corals. The steep sides are thickly hung\r\nwith lianas, ferns, and orchids, by help of which one climbs upwards\r\nto the cavern, sixty feet above the surface of the water. To add to\r\nthe singularity of the situation, we also found at the entrance to\r\nthe grotto, on a large block of rock projecting two feet above the\r\nground, [A sea snake.] a sea-snake, which tranquilly gazed at us,\r\nbut which had to be killed, because, like all genuine sea-snakes,\r\nit was poisonous. Twice before I had found the same species in\r\ncrevices of rock on the dry land, where the ebb might have left it;\r\nbut it was strange to meet with it in this place, at such a height\r\nabove the sea. It now reposes, as Platurus fasciatus Daud., in the\r\nZoological Museum of the Berlin University.\r\n\r\n[Chinese dishers from a cave.] In Guiuan I had an opportunity of\r\npurchasing four richly painted Chinese dishes which came from a\r\nsimilar cavern, and a gold signet ring; the latter consisting of a\r\nplate of gold, originally bent into a tube of the thickness of a quill\r\nwith a gaping seam, and afterwards into a ring as large as a thaler,\r\nwhich did not quite meet. The dishes were stolen from me at Manila.\r\n\r\n[Burial caves.] There are similar caverns which have been used\r\nas burial-places in many other localities in this country; on the\r\nisland of Andog, in Borongan (a short time ago it contained skulls);\r\nalso at Batinguitan, three hours from Borongan, on the banks of a\r\nlittle brook; and in Guiuan, on the little island of Monhon, which is\r\ndifficult of approach by reason of the boisterous sea. In Catubig\r\ntrinkets of gold have been found, but they have been converted\r\ninto modern articles of adornment. One cavern at Lauang, however,\r\nis famous over the whole country on account of the gigantic, flat,\r\ncompressed skulls, without sutures, which have been found in it.\r\n[182] It will not be uninteresting to compare the particulars here\r\ndescribed with the statements of older authors; and for this reason\r\nI submit the following extracts:--\r\n\r\n[Embalming.] Mas (Informe, i. 21), who does not give the sources of\r\nhis information, thus describes the customs of the ancient inhabitants\r\nof the archipelago at their interments:--They sometimes embalmed\r\ntheir dead with aromatic substances * * * and placed those who were\r\nof note in chests carved out of a branch of a tree, and furnished\r\nwith well-fitted lids * * * The coffin was placed, in accordance with\r\nthe wish of the deceased, expressed before his death, either in the\r\nuppermost room of the house, where articles of value were secreted,\r\nor under the dwelling-house, in a kind of grave, which was not\r\ncovered, but enclosed with a railing; or in a distant field, or on\r\nan elevated place or rock on the bank of a river, where he might be\r\nvenerated by the pious. A watch was set over it for a certain time,\r\nlest boats should cross over, and the dead person should drag the\r\nliving after him.\r\n\r\n[Burial customs.] According to Gaspar San Agustín (p. 169), the\r\ndead were rolled up in cloths, and placed in clumsy chests, carved\r\nout of a block of wood, and buried under their houses, together with\r\ntheir jewels, gold rings, and some plates of gold over the mouth and\r\neyes, and furnished with provisions, cups, and dishes. They were also\r\naccustomed to bury slaves along with men of note, in order that they\r\nmight be attended in the other world.\r\n\r\n\"Their chief idolatry consisted in the worship of those of their\r\nancestors who had most distinguished themselves by courage and genius,\r\nwhom they regarded as deities * * * * They called them humalagar,\r\nwhich is the same as manes in the Latin * * * Even the aged died under\r\nthis conceit, choosing particular places, such as one on the island of\r\nLeyte, which allowed of their being interred at the edge of the sea,\r\nin order that the mariners who crossed over might acknowledge them\r\nas deities, and pay them respect.\" (Thévenot, Religieux, p. 2.)\r\n\r\n[Slaves sacrificed.] \"They did not place them (the dead) in the earth,\r\nbut in coffins of very hard, indestructible wood * * * Male and female\r\nslaves were sacrificed to them, that they should not be unattended\r\nin the other world. If a person of consideration died, silence was\r\nimposed upon the whole of the people, and its duration was regulated\r\nby the rank of the deceased; and under certain circumstances it was\r\nnot discontinued until his relations had killed many other persons\r\nto appease the spirit of the dead.\" (Ibid., p. 7.)\r\n\r\n\"For this reason (to be worshipped as deities) the oldest of them\r\nchose some remarkable spot in the mountains, and particularly on\r\nheadlands projecting into the sea, in order to be worshipped by the\r\nsailors.\" (Gemelli Careri, p. 449.)\r\n\r\n[Basey and its river.] From Tacloban, which I chose for my headquarters\r\non account of its convenient tribunal, and because it is well supplied\r\nwith provisions, I returned on the following day to Samar, and then\r\nto Basey, which is opposite to Tacloban. The people of Basey are\r\nnotorious over all Samar for their laziness and their stupidity, but\r\nare advantageously distinguished from the inhabitants of Tacloban by\r\ntheir purity of manners. Basey is situated on the delta of the river,\r\nwhich is named after it. We proceeded up a small arm of the principal\r\nstream, which winds, with a very slight fall, through the plain;\r\nthe brackish water, and the fringe of nipa-palms which accompanies\r\nit, consequently extending several leagues into the country. Coco\r\nplantations stretch behind them; and there the floods of water\r\n(avenidas), which sometimes take place in consequence of the narrow\r\nrocky bed of the upper part of the river, cause great devastation,\r\nas was evident from the mutilated palms which, torn away from their\r\nstanding-place, rise up out of the middle of the river. After five\r\nhours' rowing we passed out of the flat country into a narrow valley,\r\nwith steep sides of marble, which progressively closed in and became\r\nhigher. In several places they are underwashed, cleft, and hurled over\r\neach other, and with their naked side-walls form a beautiful contrast\r\nto the blue sky, the clear, greenish river, and the luxuriant lianas,\r\nwhich, attaching themselves to every inequality to which they could\r\ncling, hung in long garlands over the rocks.\r\n\r\n[A frontage.] The stream became so rapid and so shallow that the party\r\ndisembarked and dragged the boat over the stony bed. In this manner\r\nwe passed through a sharp curve, twelve feet in height, formed by two\r\nrocks thrown opposite to each other, into a tranquil oval-shaped basin\r\nof water enclosed in a circle of limestone walls, inclining inwards,\r\nof from sixty to seventy feet in height; on the upper edge of which a\r\ncircle of trees permitted only a misty sunlight to glimmer through the\r\nthick foliage. A magnificent gateway of rock, fifty to sixty feet high,\r\nand adorned with numerous stalactites, raised itself up opposite the\r\nlow entrance; and through it we could see, at some distance, the upper\r\nportion of the river bathed in the sun. [A beautiful grotto.] A cavern\r\nof a hundred feet in length, and easily climbed, opened itself in the\r\nleft side of the oval court, some sixty feet above the surface of the\r\nwater; and it ended in a small gateway, through which you stepped on\r\nto a projection like a balcony, studded with stalactites. From this\r\npoint both the landscape and the rocky cauldron are visible, and\r\nthe latter is seen to be the remainder of a stalactitic cavern, the\r\nroof of which has fallen in. The beauty and peculiar character of the\r\nplace have been felt even by the natives, who have called it Sogoton\r\n(properly, a bay in the sea). In the very hard limestone, which is\r\nlike marble, I observed traces of bivalves and multitudes of spines of\r\nthe sea-urchin, but no well-defined remains could be knocked off. The\r\nriver could still be followed a short distance further upwards; and in\r\nits bed there were disjointed fragments of talcose and chloritic rocks.\r\n\r\n[Fishing.] A few small fishes were obtained with much difficulty;\r\nand amongst them was a new and interesting species, viviparous. [183]\r\nAn allied species (H. fluviatilis, Bleeker) which I had two years\r\npreviously found in a limestone cavern on Nusa Kambangan, in Java,\r\nlikewise contained living young ones. The net employed in fishing\r\nappears to be suited to the locality, which is a shallow river, full of\r\ntransparent blocks. It is a fine-meshed, longish, four-cornered net,\r\nhaving its ample sides fastened to two poles of bamboo, which at the\r\nbottom were provided with a kind of wooden shoes, which curve upwards\r\ntowards the stems when pushed forwards. The fisherman, taking hold of\r\nthe upper ends of the poles, pushes the net, which is held obliquely\r\nbefore him, and the wooden shoes cause it to slide over the stones,\r\nwhile another person drives the fish towards him.\r\n\r\n[Fossil beds.] On the right bank, below the cavern, and twenty\r\nfeet above the surface of the water, there are beds of fossils,\r\npectunculus, tapes, and placuna, some of which, from the fact of\r\ntheir barely adhering by the tip, must be of very recent date. I\r\npassed the night in a small hut, which was quickly erected for me,\r\nand on the following day attempted to pass up the river as far as the\r\nlimits of the crystalline rock, but in vain. In the afternoon we set\r\nout on our return to Basey, which we reached at night.\r\n\r\n[Recent elevation of coast.] Basey is situated on a bank of clay,\r\nabout fifty feet above the sea, which towards the west elevates itself\r\ninto a hill several hundred feet in height, and with steep sides. At\r\ntwenty-five to thirty feet above the sea I found the same recent beds\r\nof mussels as in the stalactitic cavern of Sogoton. From the statements\r\nof the parish priest and of other persons, a rapid elevation of the\r\ncoasts seems to be taking place in this country. Thirty years ago\r\nships could lie alongside the land in three fathoms of water at the\r\nflood, whereas the depth at the same place now is not much more than\r\none fathom. Immediately opposite to Basey lie two small islands,\r\nGenamok and Tapontonan, which, at the present time, appear to be\r\nsurrounded by a sandbank at the lowest ebb-tide. Twenty years ago\r\nnothing of the kind was to be seen. Supposing these particulars to\r\nbe correct, we must next ascertain what proportion of these changes\r\nof level is due to the floods, and how much to volcanic elevation;\r\nwhich, if we may judge by the neighboring active solfatara at Leyte,\r\nmust always be of considerable amount.\r\n\r\n[Crocodiles.] As the priest assured us, there are crocodiles in the\r\nriver Basey over thirty feet in length, those in excess of twenty\r\nfeet being numerous. The obliging father promised me one of at least\r\ntwenty-four feet, whose skeleton I would gladly have secured; and he\r\nsent out some men who are so practised in the capture of these animals\r\nthat they are dispatched to distant places for the purpose. Their\r\ncontrivance for capturing them, which I, however, never personally\r\nwitnessed, consists of a light raft of bamboo, with a stage, on which,\r\nseveral feet above the water, a dog or a cat is bound. Alongside\r\nthe animal is placed a strong iron hook, which is fastened to the\r\nswimming bamboo by means of fibers of abacá. The crocodile, when\r\nit has swallowed the bait and the hook at the same time, endeavors\r\nin vain to get away, for the pliability of the raft prevents its\r\nbeing torn to pieces, and the peculiar elasticity of the bundle of\r\nfibers prevents its being bitten through. The raft serves likewise\r\nas a buoy for the captured animal. According to the statements of\r\nthe hunters, the large crocodiles live far from human habitations,\r\ngenerally selecting the close vegetation in an oozy swamp, in which\r\ntheir bellies, dragging heavily along, leave trails behind them which\r\nbetray them to the initiated. After a week the priest mentioned that\r\nhis party had sent in three crocodiles, the largest of which, however,\r\nmeasured only eighteen feet, but that he had not kept one for me,\r\nas he hoped to obtain one of thirty feet. His expectation, however,\r\nwas not fulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Ignatius bean.] In the environs of Basey the Ignatius bean grows\r\nin remarkable abundance, as it also does in the south of Samar and\r\nin some other of the Bisayan islands. It is not met with in Luzon,\r\nbut it is very likely that I have introduced it there unwittingly. Its\r\nsphere of propagation is very limited; and my attempts to transplant\r\nit to the Botanical Garden of Buitenzorg were fruitless. Some large\r\nplants intended for that purpose, which during my absence arrived\r\nfor me at Daraga, were incorporated by one of my patrons into his\r\nown garden; and some, which were collected by himself and brought\r\nto Manila, were afterwards lost. Every effort to get these seeds\r\n(kernels), which are used over the whole of Eastern Asia as medicine,\r\nto germinate miscarried, they having been boiled before transmission,\r\nostensibly for their preservation, but most probably to secure the\r\nmonopoly of them.\r\n\r\n[Strychnine.] According to Flueckinger, [184] the gourd-shaped\r\nberry of the climbing shrub (Ignatia amara, L. Strychnos Ignatii,\r\nBerg. Ignatiana Philippinica. Lour.) contains twenty-four irregular\r\negg-shaped seeds of the size of an inch which, however, are not so\r\npoisonous as the Ignatius beans, which taste like crack-nuts. In\r\nthese seeds strychnine was found by Pelletier and Caventou in 1818,\r\nas it subsequently was in crack-nuts. The former contained twice as\r\nmuch of it as the latter, viz. one and a half per cent; but, as they\r\nare four times as dear, it is only produced from the latter.\r\n\r\n[Cholera and snake-bite cure.] In many households in the Philippines\r\nthe dangerous drug is to be found as a highly prized remedy, under the\r\nname of Pepita de Catbalonga. Gemelli Careri mentions it, and quotes\r\nthirteen different uses of it. Dr. Rosenthal (\"Synopsis Plantarum\r\nDiaphor.\" p. 363) says:--\"In India it has been employed as a remedy\r\nagainst cholera under the name of Papecta.\" Papecta is probably a\r\nclerical error. In K. Lall Dey's \"Indigenous Drugs of India,\" it is\r\ncalled Papeeta, which is pronounced Pepita in English; and Pepita is\r\nthe Spanish word for the kernel of a fruit. It is also held in high\r\nestimation as an antidote for the bite of serpents. Father Blanco\r\n(\"Flora of the Philippines,\" 61), states that he has more than once\r\nproved its efficacy in this respect in his own person; but he cautions\r\nagainst its employment internally, as it had been fatal in very many\r\ncases. It should not be taken into the mouth, for should the spittle\r\nbe swallowed, and vomiting not ensue, death would be inevitable. The\r\nparish priest of Tabaco, however, almost always carried a pepita in\r\nhis mouth. From 1842 he began occasionally to take an Ignatius bean\r\ninto his mouth as a protection against cholera, and so gradually\r\naccustomed himself to it. When I met him in 1860 he was quite well,\r\nand ascribed his health and vigor expressly to that habit. According to\r\nhis communication, in cases of cholera the decoction was successfully\r\nadministered in small doses introduced into tea; but it was most\r\nefficacious when, mixed with brandy, it was applied as a liniment.\r\n\r\n[Superstitions regarding the \"Bisayan\" bean.] Huc also (\"Thibet,\"\r\nI. 252) commends the expressed juice of the kouo-kouo (Faba\r\nIgn. amar.) both for internal and external use, and remarks that it\r\nplays a great part in Chinese medicine, no apothecary's shop being\r\nwithout it. Formerly the poisonous drug was considered a charm, as\r\nit is still by many. Father Camel [185] states that the Catbalogan\r\nor Bisayan-bean, which the Indians call Igasur or Mananaog (the\r\nvictorious), was generally worn as an amulet round the neck, being\r\na preservative against poison, contagion, magic, and philtres, so\r\npotent, indeed, that the Devil in propia persona could not harm the\r\nwearer. Especially efficacious is it against a poison communicated by\r\nbreathing upon one, for not only does it protect the wearer, but it\r\nkills the individual who wishes to poison him. Camel further mentions\r\na series of miracles which superstition ascribed to the Ignatius bean.\r\n\r\n[Coconuts.] On the southern half of the eastern border, on the shore\r\nfrom Borongan by Lauang as far as Guiuan, there are considerable\r\nplantations of cocos, which are most imperfectly applied to the\r\nproduction of oil. From Borongan and its visitas twelve thousand\r\npitchers of coconut oil are yearly exported to Manila, and the nuts\r\nconsumed by men and pigs would suffice for at least eight thousand\r\npitchers. As a thousand nuts yield eight pitchers and a half, the\r\nvicinity of Borongan alone yields annually six million nuts; for\r\nwhich, assuming the average produce at fifty nuts, one hundred-twenty\r\nthousand fullbearing palms are required. The statement that their\r\nnumber in the above-mentioned district amounts to several millions\r\nmust be an exaggeration.\r\n\r\n[Getting coco oil.] The oil is obtained in a very rude manner. The\r\nkernel is rasped out of the woody shell of the nut on rough boards,\r\nand left to rot; and a few boats in a state of decay, elevated on posts\r\nin the open air, serve as reservoirs, the oil dropping through their\r\ncrevices into pitchers placed underneath; and finally the boards are\r\nsubjected to pressure. This operation, which requires several months\r\nfor its completion, yields such a bad, dark-brown, and viscid product\r\nthat the pitcher fetches only two dollars and a quarter in Manila,\r\nwhile a superior oil costs six dollars. [186]\r\n\r\n[Oil factory.] Recently a young Spaniard has erected a factory\r\nin Borongan for the better preparation of oil. A winch, turned by\r\ntwo carabaos, sets a number of rasps in motion by means of toothed\r\nwheels and leather straps. They are somewhat like a gimlet in form,\r\nand consist of five iron plates, with dentated edges, which are\r\nplaced radiating on the end of an iron rod, and close together,\r\nforming a blunt point towards the front. The other end of the rod\r\npasses through the center of a disk, which communicates the rotary\r\nmotion to it, and projects beyond it. The workman, taking a divided\r\ncoconut in his two hands, holds its interior arch, which contains the\r\noil-bearing nut, with a firm pressure against the revolving rasp, at\r\nthe same time urging with his breast, which is protected by a padded\r\nboard, against the projecting end of the rod. The fine shreds of the\r\nnut remain for twelve hours in flat pans, in order that they may be\r\npartially decomposed. They are then lightly pressed in hand-presses;\r\nand the liquor, which consists of one-third oil and two-thirds water,\r\nis caught in tubs, from which, at the end of six hours, the oil,\r\nfloating on the surface, is skimmed off. It is then heated in iron\r\npans, containing 100 liters, until the whole of the water in it has\r\nevaporated, which takes from two to three hours. In order that the\r\noil may cool rapidly, and not become dark in color, two pailfuls of\r\ncold oil, freed from water, are poured into it, and the fire quickly\r\nremoved to a distance. The compressed shreds are once more exposed\r\nto the atmosphere, and then subjected to a powerful pressure. After\r\nthese two operations have been twice repeated, the rasped substance\r\nis suspended in sacks between two strong vertical boards and crushed\r\nto the utmost by means of clamp screws, and repeatedly shaken up. The\r\nrefuse serves as food for pigs. The oil which runs from the sacks is\r\nfree from water, and is consequently very clear, and is employed in\r\nthe cooling of that which is obtained in the first instance. [187]\r\n\r\n[Limited output.] The factory produces fifteen hundred tinajas of\r\noil. It is in operation only nine months in the year; from December to\r\nFebruary the transport of nuts being prevented by the tempestuous seas,\r\nthere being no land communication. The manufacturer was not successful\r\nin procuring nuts from the immediate vicinity in sufficient quantity\r\nto enable him to carry on his operations without interruption, nor,\r\nduring the favorable season of the year, could he lay up a store for\r\nthe winter months, although he paid the comparatively high price of\r\nthree dollars per thousand.\r\n\r\n[Illogical business.] While the natives manufactured oil in the manner\r\njust described, they obtained from a thousand nuts three and a half\r\npots, which, at six reals each, fetched twenty-one reals; that is three\r\nreals less than was offered them for the raw nuts. These data, which\r\nare obtained from the manufacturers, are probably exaggerated, but\r\nthey are in the main well founded; and the traveller in the Philippines\r\noften has the opportunity of observing similar anomalies. For example,\r\nin Daet, North Camarines, I bought six coconuts for one cuarto, at\r\nthe rate of nine hundred and sixty for one dollar, the common price\r\nthere. On my asking why no oil-factory had been erected, I received\r\nfor answer that the nuts were cheaper singly than in quantities. In\r\nthe first place, the native sells only when he wants money; but he\r\nknows that the manufacturer cannot well afford to have his business\r\nsuspended; so, careless of the result, he makes a temporary profit,\r\nand never thinks of ensuring for himself a permanent source of income.\r\n\r\n[Sugar venders.] In the province of Laguna, where the natives prepare\r\ncoarse brown sugar from sugar-cane, the women carry it for leagues to\r\nthe market, or expose it for sale on the country roads, in small loaves\r\n(panoche), generally along with buyo. Every passenger chats with the\r\nseller, weighs the loaf in the hand, eats a bit, and probably passes\r\non without buying any. In the evening the woman returns to her home\r\nwith her wares, and the next day repeats the same process.\r\n\r\n[Disproportionate prices.] I have lost my special notes, but I\r\nremember that in two cases at least the price of the sugar in these\r\nloaves was cheaper than by the picul. Moreover, the Government of the\r\nday anticipated the people in setting the example, by selling cigars\r\ncheaper singly than in quantities.\r\n\r\n[Uncertain trading.] In Europe a speculator generally can calculate\r\nbeforehand, with the greatest certainty, the cost of production of any\r\narticle; but in the Philippines it is not always so easy. Independently\r\nof the uncertainty of labor, the regularity of the supply of raw\r\nmaterial is disturbed, not only by laziness and caprice, but also\r\nby jealousy and distrust. The natives, as a rule, do not willingly\r\nsee Europeans settle amongst them and engage successfully in local\r\noperations which they themselves do not understand how to execute; and\r\nin like manner the creoles are reserved with foreigners, who generally\r\nare superior to them in capital, skill, and activity. Besides jealousy,\r\nsuspicion also plays a great part, and this influences the native\r\nas well against the mestizo as against the Castilian. Enough takes\r\nplace to the present day to justify this feeling; but formerly, when\r\nthe most thrifty subjects could buy governorships, and shamelessly\r\nfleece their provinces, such outrageous abuses are said to have been\r\npermitted until, in process of time, suspicion has become a kind of\r\ninstinct amongst the Filipinos.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\n[Leyte.] The island of Leyte, between 9° 49' and 11° 34' N., and\r\n124° 7' and 125° 9' E. Gr., is above twenty-five miles in length,\r\nand almost twelve miles broad, and contains one hundred seventy\r\nsquare miles. As I have already remarked, it is divided from Samar\r\nonly by the small strait of San Juanico. The chief town, Tacloban or\r\nTaclobang, lies at the eastern entrance of this strait, with a very\r\ngood harbor and uninterrupted communication with Manila, and has\r\nconsequently become the chief emporium of trade to Leyte, Biliran,\r\nand South and East Samar. [188]\r\n\r\n[Obliging Spanish officials.] The local governor likewise showed me\r\nmuch obliging attention; indeed, almost without exception I have,\r\nsince my return, retained the most agreeable remembrances of the\r\nSpanish officials; and, therefore, if fitting opportunity occurred,\r\nI could treat of the improprieties of the Administration with greater\r\nimpartiality.\r\n\r\n[Locusts.] In the afternoon of the day after my arrival at Tacloban, on\r\na sudden there came a sound like the rush of a furious torrent; the air\r\nbecame dark, and a large cloud of locusts swept over the place. [189]\r\nI will not again recount that phenomenon, which has been so often\r\ndescribed, and is essentially the same in all quarters of the globe,\r\nbut will simply remark that the swarm, which was more than five hundred\r\nfeet in width, and about fifty feet in depth, its extremity being\r\nlost in the forest, was not thought a very considerable one. It caused\r\nvigilance, but not consternation. Old and young eagerly endeavored to\r\ncatch as many of the delicate creatures as they could, with cloths,\r\nnets, and flags, in order, as Dampier relates, \"to roast them in\r\nan earthen pan over fire until their legs and wings drop off, and\r\ntheir heads and backs assume the color of boiled crabs;\" after which\r\nprocess he says they had a pleasant taste. In Burma at the present day,\r\nthey are considered as delicacies at the royal court. [190]\r\n\r\n[Plan for their extermination.] The locusts are one of the greatest\r\nplagues of the Philippines, and sometimes destroy the harvest of entire\r\nprovinces. The Legislación Ultramarina (iv. 504) contains a special\r\nedict respecting the extirpation of these devastating pests. As soon\r\nas they appear, the population of the invaded localities are to be\r\ndrawn out in the greatest possible numbers, under the conduct of the\r\nauthorities, in order to effect their destruction. The most approved\r\nmeans for the attainment of this object are set forth in an official\r\ndocument referring to the adoption of extraordinary measures in cases\r\nof public emergency; and in this the locusts are placed midway between\r\nsea-pirates and conflagrations. Of the various means that have been\r\ncontrived against the destructive creatures, that, at times, appear\r\nin incredible numbers, but have been as frequently ineffectual as\r\notherwise, only a few will be now mentioned. On April 27, 1824,\r\nthe Sociedad Economica determined to import the bird, the martin\r\n(Gracula sp.), \"which feeds by instinct on locusts.\" In the autumn\r\nof the following year the first consignment arrived from China; in\r\n1829 a second; and in 1852 again occurs the item of $1,311 for martins.\r\n\r\n[Tacloban to Tanauan.] On the following day I proceeded with the\r\npriest of Dagami (there are roads in Leyte) from Tacloban southwards\r\nto Palos and Tanauan, two flourishing places on the east coast. Hardly\r\nhalf a league from the latter place, and close to the sea, a cliff\r\nof crystal lime rock rises up out of the sandy plain, which was level\r\nup to this point. It is of a greyish-green quartzose chlorite schist,\r\nfrom which the enterprising Father had endeavored, with a perseverance\r\nworthy of better success, to procure lime by burning. After an ample\r\nbreakfast in the convent, we proceeded in the afternoon to Dagami,\r\nand, on the next day, to Burauen. [191]\r\n\r\n[A pleasing people.] The country was still flat. Coco-groves and\r\nrice-fields here and there interrupted the thick forest; but the\r\ncountry is thinly inhabited, and the people appear more cheerful,\r\nhandsomer, and cleaner than those of Samar. South of Burauen rises\r\nthe mountain ridge of Manacagan, on the further slope of which is a\r\nlarge solfatara, which yields sulphur for the powder manufactory in\r\nManila, and for commerce. A Spanish sailor accompanied me. Where the\r\nroad passed through swamp we rode on carabaos. The pace of the animals\r\nis not unpleasant, but the stretching across the broad backs of the\r\ngigantic carabaos of the Philippines is very fatiguing. A quarter of an\r\nhour beyond Burauen we crossed the Daguitan, which flows south-west to\r\nnorth-east, and is a hundred feet broad, its bed being full of large\r\nvolcanic blocks; and, soon after, a small river in a broad bed; and,\r\nsome hundred paces farther, one of a hundred and fifty feet in breadth;\r\nthe two latter being arms of the Burauen. They flow from west to east,\r\nand enter the sea at Dulag. The second arm was originated only the\r\npreceding year, during a flood.\r\n\r\n[The height of hospitality.] We passed the night in a hut on\r\nthe northern slope of the Manacagan, which the owner, on seeing\r\nus approach, had voluntarily quitted, and with his wife and child\r\nsought other lodgings. The customs of the country require this when\r\nthe accommodation does not suffice for both parties; and payment for\r\nthe same is neither demanded nor, except very rarely, tendered.\r\n\r\n[Up the Manacagan.] About six o'clock on the following morning we\r\nstarted; and about half-past six climbed, by a pleasant path through\r\nthe forest, to the ridge of the Manacagan, which consists of trachytic\r\nhornblende; and about seven o'clock we crossed two small rivers flowing\r\nnorth-west, and then, by a curve, reached the coast at Dulag. From the\r\nridge we caught sight, towards the south, of the great white heaps\r\nof débris of the mountain Danan glimmering through the trees. About\r\nnine o'clock we came through the thickly-wooded crater of the Kasiboi,\r\nand, further south, to some sheds in which the sulphur is smelted.\r\n\r\n[Sulphur.] The raw material obtained from the solfatara is bought in\r\nthree classes: firstly, sulphur already melted to crusts; secondly,\r\nsublimated, which contains much condensed water in its interstices;\r\nand thirdly, in the clay, which is divided into the more or less\r\nrich, from which the greatest quantity is obtained. Coconut oil,\r\nwhich is thrown into flat iron pans holding six arrobas, is added to\r\nthe sulphurous clay, in the proportion of six quarts to four arrobas,\r\nand it is melted and continually stirred. The clay which floats on\r\nthe surface, now freed from the sulphur, being skimmed off, fresh\r\nsulphurous clay is thrown into the cauldron, and so on. In two or\r\nthree hours six arrobas of sulphur, on an average, may be obtained\r\nin this manner from twenty-four arrobas of sulphurous clay, and,\r\npoured into wooden chests, it is moulded into blocks of about four\r\narrobas. Half the oil employed is recovered by throwing the clay\r\nwhich has been saturated with it into a frame formed by two narrow\r\nbamboo hurdles, placed at a sharp angle. The oil drops into a sloping\r\ngutter of bamboo which is placed underneath, and from that flows into a\r\npot. The price of the sulphur at Manila varies between [Prices.] $1.25\r\nand $4.50 per picul. I saw the frames, full of clay, from which the\r\noil exuded; but the operation itself I did not, unfortunately, then\r\nwitness, and I cannot explain in what manner the oil is added. From\r\nsome experiments made on a small scale, therefore under essentially\r\ndifferent conditions, and never with the same material, it appeared\r\nthat the oil accelerates the separation of the sulphur, and retards\r\nthe access of the air to the sulphur. In these experiments, the sulphur\r\ncontained in the bottom of the crucible was always colored black by the\r\nseparation of charcoal from the oil, and it was necessary to purify it\r\nby distillation beforehand. Of this, however, the smelters at Leyte\r\nmade no mention, and they even had no apparatus for the purpose,\r\nwhile their sulphur was of a pure yellow color.\r\n\r\n[Hot spring.] Some hundreds of paces further south, a hot spring\r\n(50° R.), [192] twelve feet broad, flows from the east, depositing\r\nsilicious sinter at its edges.\r\n\r\n[A solfatara.] As we followed a ravine stretching from north to south,\r\nwith sides one hundred to two hundred feet in height, the vegetation\r\ngradually ceased, the rock being of a dazzling white, or colored by\r\nsublimated sulphur. In numerous places thick clouds of vapor burst from\r\nthe ground, with a strong smell of sulphurated water. At some thousand\r\npaces further, the ravine bends round to the left (east), and expands\r\nitself to the bay; and here numerous silicious springs break through\r\nthe loose clay-earth, which is permeated with sulphur. This solfatara\r\nmust formerly have been much more active than it is now. The ravine,\r\nwhich has been formed by its destruction of the rock, and is full\r\nof lofty heaps of débris, may be one thousand feet in breadth, and\r\nquite five times as long. At the east end there are a number of small,\r\nboiling quagmires, which, on forcing a stick into the matted ground,\r\nsend forth water and steam. In some deep spots further west, grey,\r\nwhite, red, and yellow clays have been deposited in small beds over\r\neach other, giving them the appearance of variegated marls.\r\n\r\n[Petrifying water] To the south, right opposite to the ridge which\r\nleads to Burauen, may be seen a basin twenty-five feet broad, in a\r\ncavern in the white decomposed rock, from which a petrifying water\r\ncontaining silicious acid flows abundantly. The roof of the cavern is\r\nhung with stalactites, which either are covered with solid sulphur,\r\nor consist entirely of that substance.\r\n\r\n[Danan solfatara.] On the upper slope of the Danan mountain, near\r\nto the summit, so much sulphur is deposited by the vapors from the\r\nsulphurated water that it may be collected with coconut shells. In\r\nsome crevices, which are protected against the cooling effects of\r\nthe atmospheric air, it melts together in thick, brown crusts. The\r\nsolfatara of Danan is situated exactly south of that below, at\r\nthe end of the ravine of the Kasiboi. The clay earth, from which\r\nthe silicic acid has been washed out by the rains, is carried into\r\nthe valley, where it forms a plain, the greater part of which is\r\noccupied by a small lake, Malaksan (sour), slightly impregnated with\r\nsulphuric acid. Its surface, which, by reason of the very flat banks,\r\nis protected against the weather, I found to be about five hundred\r\npaces long and one hundred broad. From the elevation of the solfatara,\r\na rather large fresh-water lake, surrounded by wooded mountains, is\r\nseen through a gap, exactly south, which is named Jaruanan. The night\r\nwas passed in a ruined shed at the south-east of the lake Malaksan;\r\nand on the following morning we climbed the south side of the mountain\r\nridge and, skirting the solfatara of the Danan, arrived in an hour\r\nand a half at lake Jaruanan.\r\n\r\n[Jaruanan Lake.] This lake, as well as the Malaksan, inspires\r\nthe natives with superstitious fear on account of the suspicious\r\nneighborhood of the solfatara, and therefore has not been profaned by\r\neither mariner, fisher, or swimmer, and was very full of fish. For the\r\npurpose of measuring its depth, I had a raft of bamboos constructed;\r\nand when my companions saw me floating safely on the lake, they\r\nall, without exception, sprang into it, and tumbled about in the\r\nwater with infinite delight and loud outcries, as if they wished\r\nto indemnify themselves for their long abstinence; so that the raft\r\nwas not ready before three o'clock. The soundings at the centre of\r\nthe basin, which was, at the southern edge, steeper than on the\r\nnorth, gave thirteen brazas, or over twenty-one meters of depth;\r\nthe greatest length of the lake amounted to nearly eight hundred\r\nvaras (six hundred and sixty-eight meters), and the breadth to about\r\nhalf as much. As we returned in the evening, by torchlight, over the\r\ncrest of the mountain to our night-quarters at the lake, we passed\r\nby the very modest dwelling-place of a married pair. Three branches,\r\nprojecting outwards from the principal trunk of a tree, and lopped at\r\nequal points, sustained a hut of bamboos and palm-leaves of eight feet\r\nsquare. A hole in the floor formed the entrance, and it was divided\r\ninto a chamber and ante-chamber, and four bamboo poles supported,\r\nabove and below, two layers of bamboos, one of which furnished a\r\nbalcony, and the other a shop in which betel was sold.\r\n\r\n[To Dulag.] The day after my return to Burauen an obliging Spanish\r\nmerchant drove me through the fertile plain of volcanic sand, on\r\nwhich rice, maize, and sugar-cane were cultivated, to Dulag, which\r\nlies directly to the west, on the shore of the tranquil sea. The\r\ndistance (according to Coello three leagues) hardly amounts to two\r\nleagues. From this place, Point Guiuan, the south point of Samar,\r\nappears like an island separated from the mainland, and further south\r\n(N. 102° 4' to 103° 65° S.) Jomonjol is seen, the first island of the\r\nArchipelago sighted by Magellan on April 16, 1521. At Dulag, my former\r\ncompanion joined us in order to accompany us on the journey to the\r\nBito Lake. The arrangement of transportation and of provisions, and,\r\nstill more, the due consideration of all the propositions of three\r\nindividuals, each of whose claims were entitled to equal respect,\r\noccupied much time and required some address. We at length sailed\r\nin a large casco (barge) southwards along the coast to the mouth\r\nof the river [Up Mayo River.] Mayo, which, according to the map and\r\nthe information there given, is said to come from the Bito Lake. We\r\nproceeded upwards in a boat, but were informed at the first hut that\r\nthe lake could be reached only by making a long circuit through swampy\r\nforest; when most of our party proposed to return. Various reasons\r\nbesides the want of unanimity in the conduct of our adventure, which\r\nhad proceeded thus far, delayed our arrival at Abuyog until eleven\r\no'clock at night. In the first place, on our way, we had to cross a\r\nsmall branch of the Mayo, and after that the Bito River. The distance\r\nof the latter from Abuyog (extravagantly set down on Coello's map)\r\namounts to fourteen hundred brazas, according to the measurement of\r\nthe gobernadorcillo, which is probably correct. [193]\r\n\r\n[An unpromising road.] The following day, as it rained heavily, was\r\nemployed in making inquiries respecting the road to the Bito Lake. We\r\nreceived very varied statements as to the distance, but all agreed\r\nin painting the road thither in a discouraging light. A troublesome\r\njourney of at least ten hours appeared to us to be what most probably\r\nawaited us.\r\n\r\n[Bito Lake.] On the morrow, through a pleasant forest road, we reached\r\nin an hour the Bito River, and proceeded in boats, which we met\r\nthere, up the river between flat sandy banks covered with tall cane\r\nand reeds. In about ten minutes, some trees fallen right across the\r\nstream compelled us to make a circuit on land, which in half an hour\r\nbrought us again to the river, above the obstacles. Here we constructed\r\nrafts of bamboo, upon which, immersed to the depth of half a foot,\r\nthe material being very loosely adjusted, we reached the lake in ten\r\nminutes. We found it covered with green confervae; a double border\r\nof pistia and broad-leaved reed grasses, six to seven feet high,\r\nenclosing it all round. On the south and west some low hillocks rose\r\nup, while from the middle it appeared to be almost circular, with a\r\ngirdle of forest. Coello makes the lake much too large (four instead\r\nof one square mile), and its distance from Abuyog can be only a little\r\nover a league. With the assistance of a cord of lianas tied together,\r\nand rods placed in a line, we found its breadth five hundred and\r\neighty-five brazas or nine hundred and seventy-seven meters, (in the\r\nbroadest part it might be a little over one thousand meters); and the\r\nlength, as computed from some imperfect observations, one thousand\r\nand seven brazas (sixteen hundred and eighty meters), consequently\r\nless than one square mile. Soundings showed a gently inclined basin,\r\neight brazas, or over thirteen meters, deep in the middle. I would\r\ngladly have determined the proportions with more accuracy; but want of\r\ntime, the inaccessibility of the edge of the bank, and the miserable\r\ncondition of our raft, allowed of only a few rough measurements.\r\n\r\n[A forest home.] Not a trace of human habitations was observable\r\non the shore; but a quarter of an hour's distance from the northern\r\nedge we found a comfortable hut, surrounded by deep mud and prickly\r\ncalamus, the tenants of which, however, were living in plenty, and\r\nwith greater conveniences than many dwellers in the villages. We were\r\nvery well received and had fish in abundance, as well as tomatoes,\r\nand capsicum to season them with, and dishes of English earthenware\r\nout of which to eat them.\r\n\r\n[Snaring swine.] The abundance of wild swine had led the settlers\r\nto invent a peculiar contrivance, by which they are apprised of\r\ntheir approach even when asleep, and guided to their trail in the\r\ndarkness. A rope made of strips of banana tied together, and upwards\r\nof a thousand feet in length, is extended along the ground, one end\r\nof which is attached to a coconut shell, full of water, which is\r\nsuspended immediately over the sleeping-place of the hunter. When a\r\npig comes in contact with the rope, the water is overturned by the\r\njerk upon the sleeper, who, seizing the rope in his hand, is thereby\r\nconducted to his prey. The principal employment of our hosts appeared\r\nto be fishing, which is so productive that the roughest apparatus\r\nis sufficient. There was not a single boat, but only loosely-bound\r\nrafts of bamboo, on which the fishers, sinking, as we ourselves did\r\non our raft, half a foot deep, moved about amongst the crocodiles,\r\nwhich I never beheld in such numbers and of so large a size as in\r\nthis lake. Some swam about on the surface with their backs projecting\r\nout of the water. It was striking to see the complete indifference\r\nwith which even two little girls waded in the water in the face of\r\nthe great monsters. Fortunately the latter appeared to be satisfied\r\nwith their ample rations of fish. Four kinds of fish are said to be\r\nfound in the lake, amongst them an eel; but we got only one. [194]\r\n\r\n[A secret still.] Early on the following morning our native attendants\r\nwere already intoxicated. This led to the discovery of another\r\noccupation of the settlers, which I do not hesitate to disclose\r\nnow that the Government monopoly has been abolished. They secretly\r\ndistilled palm-brandy and carried on a considerable trade in it; and\r\nthis also explained to me why the horrors of the road to the Mayo River\r\nand to Abuyog had been painted in such warm colors. [195] We returned\r\non our rafts to the place where we had found them, a distance of\r\nabout fifteen hundred feet; and onwards, through wild cane with large\r\nclusters of flowers (Saccharum sp.), sixteen feet high, east by north,\r\nwe got to our boats, and then to the bar, whence, after a march of an\r\nhour and a half, we reached Abuyog. From Abuyog we returned by water to\r\nDulag, and by land to Burauen, where we arrived at night, sooner than\r\nour hostlers had expected, for we caught them sleeping in our beds.\r\n\r\n[Tobacco prohibition.] Not long ago much tobacco was cultivated in this\r\ncountry, and was allowed to be sold to the peasantry under certain\r\nconditions; but recently it was forbidden to be sold, except by the\r\nGovernment, who themselves determined its value at so very low a rate\r\nthat the culture of tobacco has almost entirely ceased. As the tobacco\r\ncompany, however, had already erected stores and appointed collectors,\r\nthe knowing ones rightly foresaw that these steps would be followed by\r\ncompulsory labor, even as it occurred in other places. The east coast\r\nof Leyte is said to be rising while the west is being destroyed by the\r\nsea, and at Ormog the sea is said to have advanced about fifty ells\r\n[196] in six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Bisayans.] The Bisayans--at least the inhabitants of the\r\nIslands of Samar and Leyte (I have not become closely acquainted\r\nwith any others)--belong to one race. [197] They are, physically and\r\nintellectually, in character, dress, manners and customs, so similar\r\nthat my notes, which were originally made at different points of\r\nthe two Islands, have, after removal of the numerous repetitions,\r\nfused into one, which affords a more complete picture, and affords,\r\nat the same time, opportunity for the small differences, where they\r\ndo occur, to stand out more conspicuously.\r\n\r\n[Mountaineers.] There are no Negritos either in Samar or Leyte, but\r\nCimarronese, who pay no tribute, and who do not live in villages,\r\nbut independently in the forests. Unfortunately I have had no personal\r\nintercourse with them, and what I have learned respecting them from the\r\nChristian inhabitants of Samar is too uncertain to be repeated. But it\r\ndoes seem certain that all these Cimarronese or their ancestors have\r\ntraded with the Spaniards, and that their religion has appropriated\r\nmany Catholic forms. Thus, when planting rice, and, according to\r\nancient practices, setting apart some of the seed to be offered in\r\nthe four corners of the field as sacrifice, they are accustomed to\r\nrepeat some mutilated Catholic prayers, which they appear to consider\r\nas efficacious as their old heathenish ones. Some have their children\r\nbaptized as well, as it costs nothing; but, save in these respects,\r\nthey perform no other Christian or civil obligations. They are very\r\npeaceable, neither making war with one another, nor having poisoned\r\narrows. Instances of Cimarronese, who go over to Christianity and\r\nvillage life, together with tribute and servitude, are very rare;\r\nand the number of the civilized, who return to the forests in order\r\nto become Cimarronese, is, on the other hand, very inconsiderable\r\nindeed--still smaller than in Luzon, as the natives, from the dull,\r\nalmost vegetating life which they lead, are not easily brought into\r\nsuch straitened circumstances as to be compelled to leave their\r\nvillage, which, still more than in Luzon, is all the world to them.\r\n\r\n[Rice-farming.] The culture of rice follows the seasons of the year. In\r\nsome places where there are large fields the plough (arado) and the\r\nsod-sod (here called surod) are employed; but, almost universally, the\r\nrice-field is only trodden over by carabaos in the rainy season. Sowing\r\nis done on the west coast in May and June, planting in July and August,\r\nand reaping from November to January. One ganta of seed-corn gives two,\r\nsometimes from three to four, cabanes (i.e., fifty, seventy-five,\r\nand a hundred fold). In the chief town, Catbalogan, there are but\r\nvery few irrigated fields (tubigan, from tubig, water), the produce\r\nof which does not suffice for the requirements, and the deficiency\r\nis made up from other places on the coasts of the Island. On the\r\nother hand, Catbalogan produces abaca, coconut oil, wax, balate\r\n(edible holothuria, sea cucumber), dried fish, and woven stuffs. On\r\nthe north and east coasts sowing takes place from November to January,\r\nand reaping six months later. During the remaining six months the field\r\nserves as pasture for the cattle; but in many places rice culture goes\r\non even during these months, but on other fields. A large portion of\r\nthis rice is frequently lost on account of the bad weather.\r\n\r\n[Land tenure.] Purchases of land are seldom made, it being generally\r\nacquired by cultivation, by inheritance, or forfeiture. In Catbalogan\r\nthe best rice land was paid for at the rate of one dollar for a ganta\r\nof seed-corn, and, on the north coast of Lauang, a field producing\r\nyearly one hundred cabanes was purchased for thirty dollars. Reckoning,\r\nas in Naga, one ganta of seed-corn at four loanes, and seventy-five\r\ncabanes of produce at one quiñon, the eastern rice land costs, in\r\nthe first instance, three thalers and a third, in the second three\r\nthalers. The owner lets the bare property out on leases, and receives\r\none-half the harvest as rent. [198] The cultivation of rice in Leyte\r\nis conducted as in Samar, but it has given way to the cultivation of\r\nabacá; the governors, while they were allowed to trade, compelled\r\nthe natives to devote a part of their fields and of their labor to\r\nit. Should a peasant be in arrears, it is the prevalent custom in\r\nthe country for him to pay to the dealer double the balance remaining\r\ndue at the next harvest.\r\n\r\n[Mountain rice.] Mountain-rice culture, which in Catbalogan is almost\r\nthe only cultivation, requires no other implement of agriculture\r\nthan the bolo to loosen the soil somewhat, and a sharp stick for\r\nmaking holes at distances of six inches for the reception of five or\r\nsix grains of rice. Sowing is done from May to June, weeding twice,\r\nand five months later it is cut stalk by stalk; the reaper receiving\r\nhalf a real daily wages and food. The produce is between two and three\r\ncabanes per ganta, or fifty to seventy fold. The land costs nothing,\r\nand wages amount to nearly five reals per ganta of seed-corn. After a\r\ngood harvest the caban fetches four reales; but just before the harvest\r\nthe price rises to one dollar, and often much higher. The ground is\r\nused only once for dry rice; camote (batata), abacá, and caladium being\r\nplanted on it after the harvest. Mountain rice is more remunerative\r\nthan watered rice about in the proportion of nine to eight.\r\n\r\n[Other products.] Next to rice the principal articles of sustenance\r\nare camote (convolvulus batatas), ubi (dioscorea), gabi (caladium),\r\npalauan (a large arum, with taper leaves and spotted stalk). Camote\r\ncan be planted all the year around, and ripens in four months; but\r\nit takes place generally when the rice culture is over, when little\r\nlabor is available. When the cultivation of camote is retained,\r\nthe old plants are allowed to multiply their runners, and only the\r\ntubers are taken out of the ground. But larger produce is obtained by\r\ncleaning out the ground and planting anew. From eighteen to fifteen\r\ngantas may be had for half a real.\r\n\r\n[Abacá.] Although there are large plantations of abacá, during my\r\nvisit it was but little cultivated, the price not being sufficiently\r\nremunerative.\r\n\r\n[Tobacco.] Tobacco also is cultivated. Formerly it might be sold in\r\nthe country, but now it has to be delivered to the government.\r\n\r\n[Balao oil.] A resinous oil (balao or malapajo) is found in Samar\r\nand Albay, probably also in other provinces. It is obtained from a\r\ndipterocarpus (apiton), one of the loftiest trees of the forest, by\r\ncutting in the trunk a wide hole, half a foot deep, hollowed out into\r\nthe form of a basin, and from time to time lighting a fire in it, so as\r\nto free the channels, through which it flows, of obstructions. The oil\r\nthus is collected daily and comes into commerce without any further\r\npreparation. Its chief application is in the preservation of iron\r\nin shipbuilding. Nails dipped in the oil of the balao, before being\r\ndriven in, will, as I have been assured by credible individuals,\r\ndefy the action of rust for ten years; but it is principally used as a\r\nvarnish for ships, which are painted with it both within and without,\r\nand it also protects wood against termites and other insects. The\r\nbalao is sold in Albay at four reals for the tinaja of ten gantas (the\r\nliter at eight pence). A cement formed by the mixture of burnt lime,\r\ngum elemi, and coconut oil, in such proportions as to form a thick\r\npaste before application, is used for the protection of the bottoms\r\nof ships; and the coating is said to last a year. [199] [Wax.] Wax\r\nis bartered by the Cimarronese. The whole of Samar annually yields\r\nfrom two hundred to three hundred piculs, whose value ranges between\r\ntwenty-five and fifty dollars per picul, while in Manila the price\r\nis generally five to ten dollars higher; but it fluctuates very much,\r\nas the same product is brought from many other localities and at very\r\nirregular intervals of time.\r\n\r\n[Scarcity of stock.] There is hardly any breeding of cattle,\r\nnotwithstanding the luxuriant growth of grasses and the absence of\r\ndestructive animals. Horses and carabao are very rare, and are said\r\nto have been introduced late, not before the present century. As in\r\nSamar there are hardly any other country roads than the seashore and\r\nthe shallow beds of rivers (it is better in the north of Leyte),\r\nthe carabao is used only once every year in treading over the\r\nearth of the rice-field. During the year he roams at large on the\r\npastures, in the forest, or on a small island, where such exists,\r\nin the neighborhood. Some times in the year one may see several\r\ncarabaos, attached to the large trunk of a tree, dragging it to the\r\nvillage. Their number, consequently, is extremely small. Carabaos\r\nwhich tread the rice land well are worth as much as ten dollars. The\r\nmean price is three dollars for a carabao, and five to six dollars\r\nfor a caraballa. Horned cattle are only occasionally used as victims\r\nat festivals. The property of several owners, they are very limited in\r\nnumber, and live half-wild in the mountains. There is hardly any trade\r\nin them, but the average price is three dollars for a heifer, and five\r\nor six dollars for a cow. [Swine.] Almost every family possesses a pig;\r\nsome, three or four of them. A fat pig costs six or seven dollars,\r\neven more than a cow. Many Filipino tribes abstain strictly from beef;\r\nbut pork is essential to their feasts. Grease, too, is so dear that\r\nfrom three to four dollars would, under favorable circumstances,\r\nbe got on that account for a fat animal. [Sheep and goats.] Sheep\r\nand goats thrive well, and propagate easily, but also exist only in\r\nsmall numbers, and are hardly utilized either for their wool or their\r\nflesh. Creoles and mestizos are for the most part too idle even to\r\nkeep sheep, preferring daily to eat chicken. The sheep of Shanghai,\r\nimported by the governor of Tacloban, also thrive and propagate\r\nfamously. [Poultry.] A laying hen costs half a real, a rooster the\r\nsame, and a game cock as much as three dollars, often considerably\r\nmore. Six or eight hens, or thirty eggs, may be bought for one real.\r\n\r\n[Cost of food.] A family consisting of father, mother, and five\r\nchildren requires daily nearly twenty-four chupas of palay (rice in\r\nthe husk), which, after winnowing, comes to about twelve chupas. This\r\nat the average price of four reals per cavan costs about half a\r\nreal. The price, however, varies. Sometimes, after the harvest, it\r\nis three reals per cavan; before it, ten; and in Albay, even about\r\nthirty reals. Then about three cuartos are wanted for extras (as fish,\r\ncrabs, vegetables, etc.), which, however, are generally collected\r\nby the children; and, lastly, for oil two cuartos, buyo one cuarto,\r\ntobacco three cuartos (three leaves for one cuarto), the latter being\r\nsmoked, not chewed. A woman consumes half as much buyo and tobacco\r\nas a man. Buyo and tobacco are less used in Leyte than in Samar.\r\n\r\n[Clothing cost.] For clothing a man requires yearly--four rough\r\nshirts of guinara, costing from one to two reals; three or four pairs\r\nof trousers, at one to two and a half reals; two kerchiefs for the\r\nhead, at one and a half real (hats are not worn on the south and west\r\ncoasts), and for the church festivals generally one pair of shoes,\r\nseven reals; one fine shirt, a dollar or more; and fine pantaloons,\r\nat four reals. A woman requires--four to six camisas of guinara,\r\nat one real; two to three sayas of guinara, at three to four reals,\r\nand one or two sayas of European printed cotton, at five reals; two\r\nhead-kerchiefs at one and a half to two reals; and one or two pairs\r\nof slippers (chinelas) to go to mass in, at two reals and upwards.\r\n\r\n[Women's extras.] The women generally have, besides, a fine camisa\r\ncosting at least six reals; a mantilla for churchgoing, six reals\r\n(it lasts four years); and a comb, two cuartos. Many also have under\r\nskirts (nabuas), two pieces at four reals, and earrings of brass\r\nand a rosary, which last articles are purchased once for all. In the\r\npoorer localities, Lauang for instance, only the home-woven guinaras\r\nare worn; and there a man requires--three shirts and three pairs of\r\ntrousers, which are cut out of three pieces of guinara, at two reals,\r\nand a salacot (hat), generally home made, worth half a real; while a\r\nwoman uses yearly--four sayas, value six reals; and a camisa, with a\r\nfiner one for the festivals, eight reals. Underskirts are not worn;\r\nand the clothing of the children may be estimated at about half of\r\nthe above rates.\r\n\r\n[Household furniture.] For household furniture a family has a cooking\r\npot [200] of unglazed burnt clay, imported by ships from Manila, the\r\ncost of which is fixed by the value of its contents in rice; a supply\r\nof bamboo-canes; seven plates, costing between two and five cuartos;\r\na carahai (iron pan), three to four reals; coconut shells serving\r\nfor glasses; a few small pots, altogether half a real; a sundang,\r\nfour to six reals, or a bolo (large forest knife), one dollar; and\r\na pair of scissors (for the women), two reals. The loom, which every\r\nhousehold constructs for itself of bamboo of course costs nothing.\r\n\r\n[Wages.] The rate of daily wages, in the case of Filipino employers,\r\nis half a real, without food; but Europeans always have to give\r\none real and food, unless, by favor of the gobernadorcillo, they\r\nget polistas at the former rate, which then regularly goes into the\r\npublic coffers. An ordinary carpenter earns from one to two reals;\r\na skilful man, three reals daily. The hours of work are from six to\r\nnoon, and from two to six in the evening.\r\n\r\n[Industries.] Almost every village has a rude smith, who understands\r\nthe making of sundangs and bolos; but the iron and the coal required\r\nfor the purpose must be supplied with the order. No other work in\r\nmetal is executed. With the exception of a little ship-building,\r\nhardly any other pursuit than weaving is carried on; the loom is\r\nrarely wanting in a household. Guinara, i.e., stuff made of the abacá,\r\nis manufactured, as well as also some piña, or figured silk stuffs,\r\nthe silk being brought from Manila, and of Chinese origin. All these\r\nfabrics are made in private homes; there are no factories.\r\n\r\n[Barter.] In places where rice is scarce the lower class of people\r\ncatch fish, salt and dry them, and barter them for rice. In the\r\nchief towns purchases are made with the current money; but, in the\r\ninterior, where there is hardly any money, fabrics and dried fish are\r\nthe most usual means of exchange. Salt is obtained by evaporating\r\nthe seawater in small iron hand-pans (carahais), without previous\r\nevaporation in the sun. The navigation between Catbalogan and Manila\r\ncontinues from December to July, and in the interval between those\r\nmonths the ships lie dismantled under sheds. [Communication.] There\r\nalso is communication by the coast eastwards to Guian, northwards\r\nto Catarman, and sometimes to Lauang. The crews consist partly of\r\nnatives, and partly of foreigners, as the natives take to the sea\r\nwith great reluctance; indeed, almost only when compelled to leave\r\ntheir villages. Samar has scarcely any other means of communication\r\nbesides the navigation of the coast and rivers, the interior being\r\nroadless; and burdens have to be conveyed on the shoulders. An\r\nable-bodied porter, who receives a real and a half without food,\r\nwill carry three arrobas (seventy-five pounds at most) six leagues in\r\na day, but he cannot accomplish the same work on the following day,\r\nrequiring at least one day's rest. A strong man will carry an arroba\r\nand a half daily for a distance of six leagues for a whole week.\r\n\r\n[No markets.] There are no markets in Samar and Leyte; so that whoever\r\nwishes to buy seeks what he requires in the houses, and in like manner\r\nthe seller offers his goods.\r\n\r\n[Debts.] A Filipino seeking to borrow money has to give ample security\r\nand pay interest at the rate of one real for every dollar per month\r\n(twelve and one-half per cent. monthly); and it is not easy for\r\nhim to borrow more than five dollars, for which sum only he is\r\nlegally liable. Trade and credit are less developed in eastern and\r\nnorthern Samar than in the western part of the island, which keeps\r\nup a more active communication with the other inhabitants of the\r\nArchipelago. There current money is rarely lent, but only its value\r\nin goods is advanced at the rate of a real per dollar per mensem. If\r\nthe debtor fails to pay within the time appointed, he frequently\r\nhas to part with one of his children, who is obliged to serve the\r\nlender for his bare food, without wages, until the debt has been\r\nextinguished. I saw a young man who had so served for the term of\r\nfive years, in liquidation of a debt of five dollars which his father,\r\nwho had formerly been a gobernadorcillo in Paranas, owed to a mestizo\r\nin Catbalogan; and on the east coast a pretty young girl, who, for\r\na debt of three dollars due by her father, had then, for two years,\r\nserved a native, who had the reputation of being a spendthrift. I was\r\nshown in Borongan a coconut plantation of three hundred trees, which\r\nwas pledged for a debt of ten dollars about twenty years ago, since\r\nwhich period it had been used by the creditor as his own property;\r\nand it was only a few years since that, upon the death of the debtor,\r\nhis children succeeded, with great difficulty, in paying the original\r\ndebt and redeeming the property. It is no uncommon thing for a native\r\nto borrow two dollars and a half from another in order to purchase\r\nhis exemption from the forty days of annual service, and then,\r\nfailing to repay the loan punctually, to serve his creditor for a\r\nwhole year. [201]\r\n\r\n[People of Samar and Leyte.] The inhabitants of Samar and Leyte,\r\nwho are at once idler and filthier than those of Luzon, seem to be\r\nas much behind the Bicols as the latter are behind the Tagalogs. In\r\nTacloban, where a more active intercourse with Manila exists, these\r\nqualities are less pronounced, and the women, who are agreeable,\r\nbathe frequently. For the rest, the inhabitants of the two islands\r\nare friendly, obliging, tractable, and peaceable. Abusive language or\r\nviolence very rarely occurs, and, in case of injury, information is\r\nlaid against the offender at the tribunal. Great purity of manners\r\nseems to prevail on the north and west coasts, but not on the east\r\ncoast, nor in Leyte. External piety is universally conspicuous, through\r\nthe training imparted by the priests; the families are very united,\r\nand great influence is wielded by the women, who are principally\r\nengaged in household employments, and are tolerably skilful in weaving,\r\nand to whom only the lighter labors of the field are assigned. The\r\nauthority of the parents and of the eldest brother is supreme, the\r\nyounger sisters never venturing to oppose it; women and children are\r\nkindly treated.\r\n\r\n[Leyte.] The natives of Leyte, clinging as strongly to their native\r\nsoil as those of Samar, like them, have no partiality for the sea,\r\nthough their antipathy to it is not quite so manifest as that of the\r\ninhabitants of Samar. [202]\r\n\r\n[Public charity not accepted.] There are no benevolent institutions\r\nin either of the two islands. Each family maintains its own poor\r\nand crippled, and treats them tenderly. In Catbalogan, the chief\r\ntown of the island, with five to six thousand inhabitants, there\r\nwere only eight recipients of charity; but in Albay mendicants are\r\nnot wanting. In Lauang, when a Spaniard, on a solemn festival, had\r\ncaused it to be proclaimed that he would distribute rice to the poor,\r\nnot a single applicant came forward. The honesty of the inhabitants of\r\nSamar is much commended. Obligations are said to be contracted almost\r\nalways without written documents, and never forsworn, even if they\r\nmake default in payment. Robberies are of rare occurrence in Samar,\r\nand thefts almost unknown. There are schools also here in the pueblos,\r\nwhich accomplish quite as much as they do in Camarines.\r\n\r\n[Amusements.] Of the public amusements cock-fighting is the chief,\r\nbut it is not so eagerly pursued as in Luzon. At the church festivals\r\nthey perform a drama translated from the Spanish, generally of\r\na religious character; and the expense of the entertainment is\r\ndefrayed by voluntary contributions of the wealthy. The chief vices\r\nof the population are play and drunkenness; in which latter even\r\nwomen and young girls occasionally indulge. The marriage feasts,\r\ncombining song and dance, often continue for several days and\r\nnights together, where they have a sufficient supply of food and\r\ndrink. [Suitor's service.] The suitor has to serve in the house\r\nof the bride's parents two, three, and even five years, before he\r\ntakes his bride home; and money cannot purchase exemption from this\r\nonerous restriction. He boards in the house of the bride's parents\r\nwho furnish the rice, but he has to supply the vegetables himself.\r\n[203] At the expiration of his term of service he builds, with the\r\nassistance of his relations and friends, the house for the family\r\nwhich is about to be newly established.\r\n\r\n[Morals.] Though adultery is not unknown, jealousy is rare, and\r\nnever leads to violence. The injured individual generally goes with\r\nthe culprit to the minister, who, with a severe lecture to one,\r\nand words of consolation to the other, sets everything straight\r\nagain. Married women are more easily accessible than girls, whose\r\nprospect of marriage, however, it seems is not greatly diminished\r\nby a false step during single life. While under parental authority\r\ngirls, as a rule, are kept under rigid control, doubtless in order\r\nto prolong the time of servitude of the suitor. External appearance\r\nis more strictly regarded among the Bisayans than by the Bicols and\r\nTagalogs. Here also the erroneous opinion prevails, that the number of\r\nthe women exceeds that of the men. Instances occur of girls of twelve\r\nbeing mothers; but they are rare; and though women bear twelve or\r\nthirteen children, many of these, however, do not live. [Great infant\r\nmortality.] So much so is this the case, that families of more than\r\nsix or eight children are very rarely met with.\r\n\r\n[Superstitions.] Superstition is rife. Besides the little church images\r\nof the Virgin, which every Filipina wears by a string round the neck,\r\nmany also have heathen amulets, of which I had an opportunity of\r\nexamining one that had been taken from a very daring criminal. It\r\nconsisted of a small ounce flask, stuffed full of vegetable root\r\nfibres, which appeared to have been fried in oil. This flask, which is\r\nprepared by the heathen tribes, is accredited with the virtue of making\r\nits owner strong and courageous. The capture of this individual was\r\nvery difficult; but, as soon as the little flask was taken from him,\r\nhe gave up all resistance, and allowed himself to be bound. In almost\r\nevery large village there are one or more [Ghouls.] Asuang families who\r\nare generally dreaded and avoided, and regarded as outlaws, and who\r\ncan marry only amongst themselves. They have the reputation of being\r\ncannibals. [204] Perhaps they are descended from such tribes? At any\r\nrate, the belief is very general and firmly  rooted; and intelligent\r\nold natives when questioned by me on the subject, answered that they\r\ncertainly did not believe that the Asuangs ate men at the present time,\r\nbut that their forefathers had assuredly done so. [205]\r\n\r\n[Ancient Literature.] Of ancient legends, traditions, or ballads,\r\nit is stated that there are none. It is true they have songs at their\r\ndances, but these are spiritless improvisations, and mostly in a high\r\nkey. They have not preserved any memorials of former civilization. \"The\r\nancient Pintados possessed no temples, every one performing his\r\nanitos in his own house, without any special solemnity\"--(Morga,\r\nf. 145 v). Pigafetta (p. 92) certainly mentions that the King of Cebu,\r\nafter his conversion to Christianity, caused many temples built on the\r\nseashore to be destroyed; but these might only have been structures of\r\na very perishable kind. [Festivals and shrines.] On certain occasions\r\nthe Bisayans celebrated a great festival, called Pandot, at which\r\nthey worshipped their gods in huts, which were expressly built for the\r\npurpose, covered with foliage, and adorned with flowers and lamps. They\r\ncalled these huts simba or simbahan (the churches are so called to the\r\npresent day), \"and this is the only thing which they have similar to a\r\nchurch or a temple\"--(Informe, I., i., 17). According to Gemelli Careri\r\nthey prayed to some particular gods, derived from their forefathers,\r\nwho are called by the Bisayans Davata (Divata), and by the Tagalogs\r\nAnito; one anito being for the sea and another for the house, to\r\nwatch over the children. [206] [Ancestor worship.] In the number of\r\nthese anitos they placed their grandfathers and great-grandfathers,\r\nwhom they invoked in all their necessities, and in whose honor they\r\npreserved little statues of stone, wood, gold, and ivory, which they\r\ncalled liche or laravan. Amongst their gods they also reckoned all\r\nwho perished by the sword, or were killed by lightning, or devoured\r\nby crocodiles, believing that their souls ascended to heaven on a\r\nbow which they called balangas. Pigafetta thus describes the idols\r\nwhich were seen by him:--\"They are of wood, and concave, or hollow,\r\nwithout any hind quarters, with their arms extended, and their legs\r\nand feet bent upwards. They have very large faces, with four powerful\r\nteeth like boars' tusks, and are painted all over.\" [207]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me take a brief account of the religion of the\r\nancient Bisayans from Fr. Gaspar San Agustin (Conquest, 169):\r\n\r\n[Old religion.] The daemon, or genius, to whom they sacrificed was\r\ncalled by them Divata, which appears to denote an antithesis to the\r\nDeity, and a rebel against him. Hell was called Solad, and Heaven\r\n(in the language of the educated people) Ologan * * * The souls of\r\nthe departed go to a mountain in the province of Oton, [208] called\r\nMedias, where they are well entertained and served. The creation of\r\nthe universe is thus explained. [Creation myth.] A vulture hovering\r\nbetween heaven and earth finds no place to settle himself upon,\r\nand the water rises towards heaven; whereupon Heaven, in its wrath,\r\ncreates islands. The vulture splits a bamboo, out of which spring man\r\nand woman, who beget many children, and, when their number becomes\r\ntoo great, drive them out with blows. Some conceal themselves in the\r\nchamber, and these become the Datos; others in the kitchen, and these\r\nbecome the slaves. The rest go down the stairs and become the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n[Ports of entry.] In 1830 seven new ports were opened as an experiment,\r\nbut, owing to great frauds in the charges, were soon afterwards\r\nclosed again. In 1831 a custom-house was established at Zamboanga,\r\non the south-west point of Mindanao; and in 1855 Sual, in the Gulf\r\nof Lingayen, one of the safest harbors on the west coast of Luzon,\r\nand Iloilo in Panay, were thrown open; and in 1863 Cebu, on the island\r\nof the same name, for the direct communication with foreign countries.\r\n\r\n[Old Zamboanga fort.] Before 1635 the Spaniards had established\r\na fort at Zamboanga, which, although it certainly could not\r\nwholly prevent the piratical excursions against the colonies, yet\r\nconsiderably diminished them. [209] Until 1848 from eight hundred\r\nto fifteen hundred individuals are stated to have been carried off\r\nyearly by the Moros. [210] The establishment of this custom-house\r\nhas, therefore, been based upon political rather than commercial\r\nmotives, it being found desirable to open an easily accessible\r\nplace to the piratical states of the Sulu Sea for the disposal of\r\ntheir products. [Exports.] Trade, up to the present date, is but\r\nof very inconsiderable amount, the exports consisting chiefly of a\r\nlittle coffee (in 1871 nearly six thousand piculs), which, from bad\r\nmanagement, is worth thirty per cent. less than Manila coffee, and of\r\nthe collected products of the forest and of the water, such as wax,\r\nbirds'-nests, tortoise-shell, pearls, mother-of-pearl, and edible\r\nholothuria. This trade, as well as that with Sulu, is entirely in the\r\nhands of the Chinese, who alone possess the patience, adaptiveness,\r\nand adroitness which are required for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sual's foreign trade.] Sual is specially important for its exports\r\nof rice; and its foreign trade is therefore affected by the results of\r\nthe harvests in Saigon, Burma, and China. In 1868, when the harvests in\r\nthose countries turned out good, Sual carried on only a coasting trade.\r\n\r\n[Cebu.] Cebu (with a population of 34,000) is the chief town of the\r\nisland of the same name, the seat of Government and of the bishop of\r\nthe Bisayas, and within forty-eight hours from Manila by steamer. It\r\nis as favorably situated with regard to the eatern portion of the\r\nBisayan group as Iloilo is for the western, and is acquiring increased\r\nimportance as the emporium for its products. Sugar and tobacco are\r\nobtained from Bohol; rice from Panay; abacá from Leyte and Mindanao;\r\nand coffee, wax, Spanish cane, and mother-of-pearl from Misamis\r\n(Mindanao). Its distance from Samar is twenty-six, from Leyte two\r\nand a half, from Bohol four, and from Negros eighteen miles.\r\n\r\n[Cebu island.] The island of Cebu extends over seventy-five square\r\nmiles. A lofty mountain range traverses it from north to south,\r\ndividing the east from the west side, and its population is\r\nestimated at 340,000,--4,533 to the square mile. The inhabitants\r\nare peaceable and docile; thefts occur very seldom, and robberies\r\nnever. Their occupations are agriculture, fishing, and weaving for\r\nhome consumption. Cebu produces sugar, tobacco, maize, rice, etc.,\r\nand in the mountains potatoes; but the rice produced does not suffice\r\nfor their requirements, there being only a little level land, and\r\nthe deficiency is imported from Panay.\r\n\r\n[Land tenure.] The island possesses considerable beds of coal, the\r\nfull yield of which may now be looked for, as the duty on export was\r\nabandoned by a decree of the 5th of May, 1869. [211] While in Luzon\r\nand Panay the land is for the most part the property of the peasantry,\r\nin Cebu it mostly belongs to the mestizos, and is let out by them,\r\nin very small allotments, upon lease. The owners of the soil know how\r\nto keep the peasants in a state of dependence by usurious loans; and\r\none of the results of this abuse is that agriculture in this island\r\nstands lower than in almost any other part of the archipelago. [212]\r\n[Customhouse data.] The entire value of the exports in 1868 amounted\r\nto $1,181,050; of which sugar to the value of $481,127, and abacá to\r\nthe value of $378,256; went to England, abacá amounting to $112,000\r\nto America, and tobacco to $118,260 to Spain. The imports of foreign\r\ngoods, mostly by the Chinese, come through Manila, where they\r\npurchase from the foreign import houses. The value of these imports\r\namounted in 1868 to $182,522; of which $150,000 were for English\r\ncotton stuffs. The entire imports of the island were estimated at\r\n$1,243,582, and the exports at $226,898. Among the importations\r\nwere twenty chests of images, a sign of the deeply-rooted worship\r\nof the Virgin. Formerly the products for exportation were bought up\r\nby the foreign merchants, mostly Chinese mestizos; but now they are\r\nbought direct from the producers, who thus obtain better prices in\r\nconsequence of the abolition of the high brokerages. To this and to\r\nthe energy of the foreign merchants, under favorable circumstances,\r\nis the gradual improvement of agriculture principally to be ascribed.\r\n\r\n[Iloilo.] Iloilo is the most important of the newly opened ports,\r\nbeing the central point of the Bisayan group, and situated in one\r\nof the most thickly populated and industrious provinces. Nicholas\r\nLoney [213] estimates the export of goods woven from the fiber of\r\nthe piña, from Iloilo, and the neighboring provinces, at about one\r\nmillion dollars annually. The harbor is excellent, being completely\r\nprotected by an island which lies immediately before it; and at high\r\ntide there is about twelve feet of water close in shore for vessels\r\nto lie in. On account of the bar, however, ships of a deeper draught\r\nthan this are obliged to complete their loading outside. Previous\r\nto the opening of the new harbors, all the provinces were compelled\r\nas well to bring their products intended for exportation to Manila,\r\nas to receive from the same place their foreign imports; the cost\r\nof which therefore was greatly increased through the extra expenses\r\nincurred by the double voyage, reloading, brokerage, and wharfage\r\ncharges. According to a written account by N. Loney, it is shown how\r\nprofitable, even after a few years, the opening of Iloilo has been to\r\nthe provinces immediately adjoining--the islands of Panay and Negros.\r\n\r\n[Sugar.] The higher prices which can be obtained for directly\r\nexported sugar, combined with the facility and security of the\r\ntrade as contrasted with the late monopoly enjoyed by Manila, have\r\noccasioned a great extension of the cultivation of that article. Not\r\nonly in Iloilo, but also in Antique and Negros, many new plantations\r\nhave arisen, and the old ones have been enlarged as much as possible;\r\nand not less important has been the progress in the manufacture. In\r\n1857 there was not one iron mill to be found on the island; so that,\r\nin working with the wooden mill, about thirty per cent. of the sap\r\nremained in the cane, even after it had thrice passed through. The\r\nold wooden presses, which were worked by steam or carabaos, have now\r\nbeen supplanted by new ones; and these the native planters have no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining, as they can get them on credit from the\r\nwarehouses of the English importers. Instead of the old Chinese\r\ncast-iron pans which were in use, far superior articles have been\r\nimported from Europe; and many large factories worked by steam-power\r\nand with all modern improvements have been established. In agriculture,\r\nlikewise, creditable progress is noticeable. Improved ploughs, carts,\r\nand farming implements generally, are to be had in plenty. These\r\nchanges naturally show how important it was to establish at different\r\npoints, extending over two hundred miles of the Archipelago, commercial\r\ncenters, where it was desirable that foreigners should settle. Without\r\nthese latter, and the facilities afforded to credit which thereby\r\nensued, the sudden rise and prosperity of Iloilo would not have been\r\npossible, inasmuch as the mercantile houses in that capital would have\r\nbeen debarred from trading with unknown planters in distant provinces,\r\notherwise than for ready money. A large number of half-castes, too,\r\nwho before traded in manufactured goods purchased in Manila, were\r\nenabled after this to send their goods direct to the provinces, to the\r\nforeign firms settled there; and as, ultimately, neither these latter\r\nnor the Chinese retail dealers could successfully compete with them,\r\nthe result has been that, as much to their own profit as to that of the\r\ncountry, they have betaken themselves to the cultivation of sugar. In\r\nthis manner important plantations have been established in Negros,\r\nwhich are managed by natives of Iloilo: but there is a scarcity of\r\nlaborers on the island.\r\n\r\n[Land disputes.] Foreigners now can legally acquire property, and\r\npossess a marketable title; in which respect the law, until a very\r\nrecent period, was of an extremely uncertain nature. Land is to be\r\nobtained by purchase, or, when not already taken up, by \"denuncia\"\r\n(i.e. priority of claim). In such case, the would-be possessor of\r\nthe land must enter into an undertaking in the nearest of the native\r\nCourts to cultivate and keep the said land in a fit and serviceable\r\ncondition. Should no other claim be put in, notice is thereupon given\r\nof the grant, and the magistrate or alcalde concludes the compact\r\nwithout other cost than the usual stamp duty.\r\n\r\n[Lack of capital for large plantations.] Many mestizos and natives,\r\nnot having the necessary capital to carry on a large plantation\r\nsuccessfully, sell the fields which they have already partially\r\ncultivated to European capitalists, who are thus relieved of all the\r\npreliminary tedious work. Evidently the Colonial Government is now\r\nsincerely disposed to favor the laying out of large plantations.\r\n\r\n[Lack of roads.] The want of good roads is particularly felt: but, with\r\nthe increase of agriculture, this defect will naturally be remedied;\r\nand, moreover, most of the sugar factories are situated on rivers which\r\nare unnavigable even by flat freight boats. The value of land in many\r\nparts of the country has doubled within the last ten years. [214]\r\n\r\n[Sugar prices.] Up to 1854 the picul of sugar was worth in Iloilo from\r\n$1.05 to $1.25 and seldom over $2.00 in Manila; in 1866, $3.25; and\r\nin 1868, $4.75 to $5.00 in Iloilo. The business in Iloilo therefore\r\nshows an increase of $1.75 per picul. [215]\r\n\r\n[Negros.] At the end of 1856 there were as many as twenty Europeans\r\nestablished on the island of Negros as sugar planters, besides a\r\nnumber of mestizos. Some of them were working with steam machinery\r\nand vacuum pans. The general rate of pay is from $2.05 to $3.00 per\r\nmonth. On some plantations the principle of acsa, i.e. part share,\r\nis in operation. The owner lets out a piece of ground, providing\r\ndraught cattle and all necessary ploughing implements, to a native,\r\nwho works it, and supplies the mill with the cut cane, receiving as\r\npayment a share, generally a third, of the product. In Negros the\r\nviolet cane is cultivated, and in Manila the white (Otaheiti). The\r\nland does not require manuring. On new ground, or what we may term\r\nvirgin soil, the cane often grows to a height of thirteen feet. A vast\r\nimprovement is to be observed in the mode of dress of the people. Piña\r\nand silk stuffs are beoming quite common. Advance in luxury is always\r\na favorable sign; according to the increase of requirements, industry\r\nflourishes in proportion.\r\n\r\n[The future sugar market.] As I have already mentioned,\r\nCalifornia, Japan, China, and Australia appear designed by nature\r\nto be the principal consumers of the products of the Philippine\r\nIslands. Certainly at present England is the best customer; but\r\nnearly half the account is for sugar, in consequence of their own\r\ncustom duties. Sometimes it happens that not more than one-fourth of\r\nthe sugar crop is sufficiently refined to compete in the Australian\r\nand Californian markets with the sorts from Bengal, Java, and the\r\nMauritius; the remaining three-fourths, if particularly white, must\r\nperforce undertake the long voyage to England, despite the high freight\r\nand certain loss on the voyage of from ten to twelve per cent. through\r\nthe leakage of the molasses. The inferior quality of the Philippine\r\nsugar is at once perceived by the English refiners, and is only taxed\r\nat 8s. per cwt., while purer sorts pay 10s. to 12s. [216]\r\n\r\n[A valuable by-product.] In this manner the English customs favor the\r\ninferior qualities of manufactured sugar. The colonial Government\r\ndid not allow those engaged in the manufacture of sugar to distil\r\nrum from the molasses until the year 1862. They had, therefore,\r\nlittle inducement to extract, at a certain expense, a substance the\r\nvalue on which they were not permitted to realize; but under ordinary\r\ncircumstances the distillation of the rum not only covered the cost\r\nof refining, but gave, in addition, a fair margin of profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n[Manila hemp.] One of the most interesting productions of the island\r\nis Manila hemp. The French, who, however, hardly use it, call it\r\n\"Silk-Plant,\" because of its silky appearance.\r\n\r\nThe natives call the fiber bandala, and in commerce (generally\r\nspeaking) abacá, just as the plant from which it is obtained.\r\n\r\n[Abacá.] The latter is a wild species of banana growing in the\r\nPhilippine Islands, known also as Arbol de Cañamo (hemp-tree), Musa\r\ntextilis, Lin. It does not differ in appearance to any great extent\r\nfrom the edible banana (Musa paradisiaca), one of the most important\r\nplants of the torrid zone, and familiar to us as being one of our\r\nmost beautiful hot-house favorites.\r\n\r\n[Undetermined plant relations.] Whether this and the \"musae\"\r\n(M. troglodytarum, M. sylvestris, and others), frequently known,\r\ntoo, as M. textilis, are of the same species, has not yet been\r\ndetermined. The species Musaceae are herbaceous plants only. The\r\nouter stem consists of crescent-shaped petioles crossing one another\r\nalternately, and encircling the thin main stem. These petioles contain\r\na quantity of bast fiber, which is used as string, but otherwise is\r\nof no commercial value. The serviceable hemp fiber has, up to the\r\npresent time, been exclusively obtained from the southern portion of\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\n[Abacá districts.] The southern Camarines and Albay are favorably\r\nadapted for the cultivation of this plant, as are also the islands\r\nof Samar and Leyte, and the adjacent islands; and Cebu likewise,\r\nalthough a portion of the so-called \"Cebu hemp\" comes from Mindanao. In\r\nNegros the bast-banana thrives only in the south, not in the north;\r\nand Iloilo, which produces most of the hemp cloth (guinara), is\r\nobliged to import the raw material from the eastern district, as it\r\ndoes not flourish in the island of Panay. In Capiz, it is true, some\r\nabacá may be noticed growing, but it is of trifling value. Hitherto\r\nall attempts, strenuous though the efforts were, to acclimatize the\r\ngrowth of hemp in the western and northern provinces have failed. The\r\nplants rarely grow as high as two feet, and the trouble and expense\r\nare simply unremunerative. This failure may be accounted for by the\r\nextreme dryness prevailing during many months of the year, whereas\r\nin the eastern provinces plentiful showers fall the whole year round.\r\n\r\n[Peculiar to the Philippines.] The great profit which the Manila\r\nhemp has yielded in the few years since its production, however, has\r\ngiven encouragement to still further experiments; so that, indeed,\r\nit will shortly be shown whether the cultivation of abacá is to be\r\nconfined to its present limited area, while the edible species of\r\nbanana has spread itself over the whole surface of the earth within\r\nthe tropics. On the volcanic mountains of Western Java a species\r\nof the Musaceae grows in great luxuriance. The Government has not,\r\nhowever, made any real effort to cultivate it, and what has been done\r\nin that respect has been effected, up to the present date, by private\r\nenterprise. Various writers have stated that abacá is to be obtained\r\nin the north of the Celebes. Bickmore, however, says positively that\r\nthe inhabitants having made great efforts in attempting its successful\r\ncultivation, have abandoned it again in favor of the cultivation of\r\ncoffee, which is found to be far more profitable. [217] According to\r\nprevious statements, Guadaloupe appears to be able to produce abacá\r\n(fiber of the M. textilis?); [218] and Pondicherry and Guadaloupe\r\nhave produced fabrics woven from abacá, and French Guiana stuffs\r\nfrom the fiber of the edible banana; [219] all these, however, are\r\nonly experiments.\r\n\r\n[Superiority of fiber.] Royle affirms that the Manila hemp (abacá\r\nfiber) excels the Russian in firmness, lightness, and strength in\r\ntension, as well as in cheapness, and has only the one disadvantage\r\nthat ropes made from it become stiff in wet weather. The reason,\r\nhowever, is found in the manner in which it is spun, and may be\r\navoided by proper preparation. [220] Through the better preparation\r\nof the raw material in Manila by means of adequate machinery, these\r\ndifficulties have been overcome; but abacá no longer has the advantage\r\nof superior cheapness, as the demand has increased much faster than\r\nthe supply. During the year 1859 it was worth from £22 to £25 per ton;\r\nin 1868, £45 per ton; while Russian hemp fetched £31 per ton. Thus\r\nin nine years it rose to double its value.\r\n\r\n[Banana varieties.] In Albay there are about twelve varieties\r\nof the best banana cultivated, which are particularly favored by\r\nthe qualities of the soil. The cultivation is extremely simple,\r\nand entirely independent of the seasons. The plants thrive best on\r\nthe slopes of the volcanic mountains (in which Albay and Camarines\r\nabound), in open spaces of the woods protected by the trees, which\r\ncast their shadows to an extent of about sixty feet. In exposed level\r\nground they do not thrive so well, and in marshy land not at all.\r\n\r\n[Cultivation.] In the laying out of a new plantation the young shoots\r\nare generally made use of, which sprout so abundantly from the roots\r\nthat each individual one soon becomes a perfect plant. In favorable\r\nground the custom is to allow a distance of about ten feet between\r\neach plant; in poor ground six feet. The only care necessary is\r\nthe extermination of the weeds, and clearing away the undergrowth\r\nduring the first season; later on, the plants grow so luxuriantly\r\nand strongly that they entirely prevent the growth of anything\r\nelse in their vicinity. The protection afforded by the shade of the\r\ntrees at this period is no longer required, the young buds finding\r\nsufficient protection against the sun's rays under cover of the\r\nfan-like leaves. Only in exceptional cases, contrary to the usual\r\npractice, are the plants raised from seed. The fruit, when ready,\r\nis cut off and dried, though care must be taken that it is not over\r\nripe; otherwise the kernels will not germinate. These latter are about\r\nthe size of peppercorns; and the extraction of them in the edible\r\nspecies almost always brings about decay. Two days before sowing,\r\nthe kernels are taken out of the fruit, and steeped overnight in\r\nwater; on the following day they are dried in a shady place; and on\r\nthe third day they are sown in holes an inch deep in fresh, unbroken,\r\nand well-shaded forest ground, allowing six inches distance between\r\neach plant and row. After a year the seedlings, which are then about\r\ntwo feet high, are planted out, and tended in the same way as the\r\nsuckers. [Differences with abacá.] While many of the edible bananas\r\nbear fruit after one year, and a few varieties even after six months,\r\nthe abacá plant requires on an average three years to produce its\r\nfiber in a proper condition; when raised from suckers four years;\r\nand raised from year-old seedlings, even under the most favorable\r\nconditions, two years.\r\n\r\n[Cutting.] On the first crop, only one stalk is cut from each bush;\r\nbut later on the new branches grow so quickly that they can be cut\r\nevery two months. [221] After a few years the plants become so strong\r\nand dense that it is scarcely possible to push through them. Bast is\r\nin its best condition at the time of blossoming; but, when the price\r\nof the fiber happens to stand high in the market, this particular\r\ntime is not always waited for.\r\n\r\n[Prejudice against cutting after blossoming.] Plants which have\r\nblossomed cease to be profitable in any way, by reason of the fiber\r\nbecoming too weak--a matter of too great nicety for the unpractical\r\nconsumers on the other side of the Atlantic to decide upon, and one\r\nin which, despite inquiries and careful inspections, they might be\r\ndeceived. There really is no perceptible reason why the fiber should\r\nbecome weaker through fructification, which simply consists in the fact\r\nof the contents of the vascular cells changing into soluble matter,\r\nand gradually oozing away, the consequence of which is that the cells\r\nof the fiber are not replenished. These, on the contrary, acquire\r\nadditional strength with the age of the plant, because the emptied\r\ncells cling so firmly together, by means of a certain resinous deposit,\r\nthat it is impossible to obtain them unbroken without a great deal of\r\ntrouble. The idea may have erroneously arisen from the circumstance\r\nthat, previously to drying, as with hemp, the old plants were picked\r\nout, and allowed to be thrown away, though not without considerably\r\nincreasing the rate of pay, which already consumed the greater part\r\nof the general expenses. [222]\r\n\r\n[Extracting the fiber.] In order to obtain the bast, the stalk above\r\nground is closely pruned and freed from leaves and other encumbrances;\r\neach leaf is then singly divided into strips--a cross incision being\r\nmade through the membrane on the inner or concave side, and connected\r\nby means of the pulpy parts (the parenchym) clinging together. In\r\nthis manner as much as possible of the clear outer skin only remains\r\nbehind. Another method is to strip the bast from the undivided stem. To\r\neffect this the operator makes an oblique incision in the skin of\r\nthe under part of the stalk, drawing the knife gradually to the tip,\r\nand stripping off the whole length as broad a piece as possible; and\r\nthe operation is repeated as many times as practicable. This method\r\nof handling is more productive than the one previously described;\r\nbut, on the other hand, it takes considerably more time, and for\r\nthat reason is not often practised. The strips of bast are then drawn\r\nunder a knife, the blade of which is three inches broad by six long,\r\nfastened at one end to the extremity of a flexible stick so that it\r\nis suspended perpendicularly over a well-smoothed block, and at the\r\nother end to a handle connected by means of a cord to a treadle, which\r\ncan be pressed firmly down, as occasion requires. The workman draws\r\nthe bast, without any regard to quality, between the knife and block,\r\ncommencing in the middle, and then from side to side. The knife must\r\nbe free from notches, or all indentations, according to the direction\r\nof Father Blanco. [223]\r\n\r\n[Laborers' work and wages.] Three hired-men usually get twenty-five\r\npounds per day. One worker cuts up the stalks, strips off the leaves,\r\nand attends to the supply; the second, frequently a boy, spreads out\r\nthe strips; and the third draws them under the knife. A single plant\r\nhas been known to yield as much as two pounds of fiber; but the most\r\nfavorable average rarely affords more than one pound, and plants grown\r\nin indifferent soil scarcely a sixth of that quantity. The plantations\r\nare worked either by the owner or by day-laborers, who, when the market\r\nprices are very low, take half share of the crop harvested by them. In\r\nthese cases an industrious workman may obtain as much as one picul in\r\na week. During my stay exceptionally low prices ruled--sixteen and\r\none-half reals per picul undelivered. The workman could, therefore,\r\nin six days earn half the amount, viz., eight and a quarter reals at\r\na rate of one and three-eighths reals per day. The day's pay at that\r\ntime was half a real, and board a quarter of a real, making together\r\nthree-quarters of a real.\r\n\r\n[Profit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        By daily pay.   Half share.\r\n\r\nThe workman therefore earned daily                   0.75 r. or     1.375 r.\r\nWages amounted to per picul                         12. 6 r. or     8. 25 r.\r\nProfit of the planters after deduction of the wages  3. 9 r. or     8. 25 r.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Lupis and bandala.] The edges of the petioles, which contain much\r\nfiner fiber than the middle parts, are separately divided into strips\r\nan inch wide, and with strong pressure are drawn several times under\r\nthe knife. This substance, which is called lupis, is in high request,\r\nbeing employed in the native weaving; while is chiefly used for ships'\r\nrigging. [224]\r\n\r\n[Grades of Lupis.] Lupis, according to the fineness of the fiber,\r\nis sorted into four classes--first, Binani; second, Totogna; third,\r\nSogotan; and fourth, Cadaclan. A bundle of these is then taken up in\r\nthe left hand, and, while with the right the first three sorts are\r\ninserted between the fingers, the fourth is held between the thumb and\r\nforefinger. This last description is no longer used in fine weaving,\r\nand is therefore sold with bandala. After the fine sorts have been\r\npounded in a rice-mortar, in order to render the fiber soft and\r\npliable, they are severally knotted into one another, and converted\r\ninto web.\r\n\r\n[Lupis fabrics.] Generally the first sort is worked as woof with the\r\nsecond as warp, and the third as warp with the second as woof. The\r\nfabrics so woven are nearly as fine as piña fabrics (Nipis de Piña),\r\nand almost equal the best quality of cambric; and, notwithstanding\r\nthe many little nodules occasioned by the tangling of the fiber,\r\nwhich may be discerned on close inspection, are clearer and stouter,\r\nand possess a warmer yellowish tint. [225] As to these last three\r\nqualities--purity, flexibility, and color--they stand in relation to\r\ncambric somewhat as cardboard to tissue-paper.\r\n\r\n[Weaving.] Weaving such fabrics on very simple looms is exceedingly\r\ntroublesome as the fibers, which are not spun but twisted, very\r\nfrequently break. The finest stuffs require so great an amount of\r\ndexterity, patience, and time in their preparation, and for that reason\r\nare so expensive, that they would find no purchasers in Europe where\r\nthere is the competition of cheap, machine-made goods. Their fine,\r\nwarm yellowish color also is objected to by the European women, who are\r\naccustomed to linen and calicoes strongly blued in the washing. In the\r\ncountry, however, high prices are paid for them by the rich mestizos,\r\nwho understand the real goodness of their qualities.\r\n\r\n[Bandala fabrics.] The fibers of the inner petioles, which are softer\r\nbut not so strong as the outer, are called tupus, and sold with\r\nbandala, or mixed with tapis and used in the native weaving. Bandala\r\nalso serves for weaving purposes; and, in that portion of the\r\nArchipelago where the native abacá plantations are, the entire dress\r\nof both sexes is made of coarse guinara. Still coarser and stronger\r\nfabrics are prepared for the European market, such as crinoline and\r\nstiff muslin used by dressmakers.\r\n\r\n[A Pre-Spanish product.] Before the arrival of the Spaniards the\r\nnatives wore stuffs from abacá; which became an important article of\r\nexport only some few decades since. This is in great measure due to\r\nthe enterprising spirit of two American firms, and would not have been\r\nattained without great perseverance and liberal pecuniary assistance.\r\n\r\n[Unbusinesslike early methods.] The plants flourish without any care\r\nor attention, the only trouble being to collect the fiber; and, the\r\nbounteousness of Nature having provided them against want, the natives\r\nshirk even this trouble when the market price is not very enticing. In\r\ngeneral low prices are scarcely to be reckoned on, because of the\r\nutter indifference of the laborers, over whom the traders do not\r\npossess enough influence to keep them at work. Advances to them are\r\nmade both in goods and money, which the creditor must repay either\r\nby produce from his own plantation or by giving an equivalent in\r\nlabor. [226] As long as the produce stands high in price, everything\r\ngoes on pretty smoothly, although even then, through the dishonesty of\r\nthe workers and the laziness, extravagance, and mercantile incapacity\r\nof the middlemen, considerable loss frequently ensues. If, however,\r\nprices experience any considerable fall, then the laborers seek in any\r\nand every way to get out of their uncomfortable position, whilst the\r\npercentage of profit secured to the middleman is barely sufficient\r\nto cover the interest on his outlay. Nevertheless, they must still\r\ncontinue the supplies, inasmuch as they possess no other means of\r\nsecuring payment of their debt in the future. The laborers, in their\r\nturn, bring bitter complaints against the agents, to the effect that\r\nthey are forced to severe labor, unprofitable to themselves, through\r\ntheir acceptance of advances made to them at most exorbitant rates; and\r\nthe agents (generally mestizos or creoles) blame the crafty, greedy,\r\nextortionate foreigners, who shamelessly tempt the lords of the soil\r\nwith false promises, and bring about their utter ruin. [Change to a\r\nsafer basis.] As a general rule, the \"crafty foreigner\" experiences\r\na considerable diminution of his capital. It was just so that one of\r\nthe most important firms suffered the loss of a very large sum. At\r\nlength, however, the Americans, who had capital invested in this trade,\r\nsucceeded in putting an end to the custom of advances, which hitherto\r\nhad prevailed, erected stores and presses on their own account,\r\nand bought through their agents direct from the growers. All earlier\r\nefforts tending in this direction had been effectually thwarted by\r\nthe Spaniards and creoles, who considered the profits derived from\r\nthe country, and especially the inland retail trade, to be their own\r\nby prescriptive right. They are particularly jealous of the foreign\r\nintruders, who enrich themselves at their expense; consequently they\r\nplace every obstacle in their way. If it depended upon the will of\r\nthese people, all foreigners would be ejected from the country--the\r\nChinese alone, as workmen (coolies), being allowed to remain. [227]\r\n\r\n[Anti-Chinese feeling.] The same feeling was exhibited by the natives\r\ntowards the Chinese, whom they hated for being industrious and\r\ntrustworthy workers. All attempts to carry out great undertakings\r\nby means of Chinese labor were frustrated by the native workmen\r\nintimidating them, and driving them away either by open violence or\r\nby secret persecution; and the Colonial authorities were reproached\r\nfor not affording suitable protection against these and similar\r\noutrages. That, as a rule, great undertakings did not succeed in the\r\nPhilippines, or at least did not yield a profit commensurate with\r\nthe outlay and trouble, is a fact beyond dispute, and is solely to\r\nbe ascribed to many of the circumstances related above. [Good work\r\nfor good pay.] There are those, however, who explain these mishaps\r\nin other ways, and insist upon the fact that the natives work well\r\nenough when they are punctually and sufficiently paid. The Government,\r\nat any rate, appears gradually to have come to the conclusion that\r\nthe resources of the country cannot be properly opened up without\r\nthe assistance of the capital and enterprise of the [Tardy justice\r\nto foreigners.] foreigners; and, therefore, of late years it has not\r\nin any way interfered with their establishment. In 1869 their right\r\nof establishment was tardily conceded to them by law.\r\n\r\n[Abacá production and prospects.] At this period the prospects of the\r\nabacá cultivation seemed very promising; and since the close of the\r\nAmerican war, which had the effect of causing a considerable fall in\r\nthe value of this article in America, the prices have been steadily\r\nincreasing. It is stated (on authority) that, in 1840, 136,034 piculs\r\nof abacá, to the value of $397,995 were exported, the value per picul\r\nbeing reckoned at about $2.09. The rate gradually rose and stood\r\nbetween four and five dollars--and, during the civil war, reached the\r\nenormous sum of nine dollars per picul--the export of Russian hemp\r\npreventing, however, a further rise. This state of affairs occasioned\r\nthe laying out of many new plantations, the produce of which, when\r\nit came on the market, after three years, was valued at $3.50 per\r\npicul, in consequence of the prices having returned to their normal\r\ncondition; and even then it paid to take up an existing plantation,\r\nbut not to lay out a new one. This rate continued until 1860, since\r\nwhich time it has gradually risen (only during the American civil\r\nwar was there any stoppage), and it now stands once more as high as\r\nduring the civil war; and there is no apparent prospect of a fall so\r\nlong as the Philippines have no competitors in the trade. In 1865 the\r\npicul in Manila never cost less than $7 which two years previously\r\nwas the maximum value; and it rose gradually, until $9.50 was asked\r\nfor ordinary qualities. The production in many provinces had reached\r\nthe extreme limit; and a further increase, in the former at least,\r\nis impossible, as the work of cultivation occupies the whole of the\r\nmale population--an evidence surely that a suitable recompense will\r\novercome any natural laziness of the natives. [228]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the following table will confirm the accuracy of\r\nthese views:--\r\n\r\n[Export of \"Manila hemp.\"]\r\n\r\nExport of Abacá (In Piculs).\r\n\r\nTo                  1861    1864    1866    1868    1870    1871\r\n\r\nGreat Britain       198,954 226,258  96,000 125,540 131,180 143,498\r\nNorth America,\r\nAtlantic Ports      158,610 249,106 280,000 294,728 327,728 285,112\r\nCalifornia            6,600   9,426      --  14,200  15,900  22,500\r\nEurope                  901   1,134      --     200     244     640\r\nAustralia                16   5,194      --  21,244  11,434   6,716\r\nSingapore             2,648   1,932      --   3,646   1,202   2,992\r\nChina                 5,531     302      --      --     882   2,294\r\n\r\nTotal               273,260 493,352 406,682 460,588 488,570 463,752\r\n\r\nCommercial Report\r\nPrussian Consular Report\r\nBelgian Consular Report\r\nEnglish Consular Report\r\nMarket Report, T.H. & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Large local consumption.] The consumption in the country is not\r\ncontained in the above schedule, and is difficult to ascertain; but\r\nit must certainly be very considerable, as the natives throughout\r\nentire provinces are clothed in guinara, the weaving of which for\r\nthe family requirements generally is done at home.\r\n\r\n[Sisal-hemp.] Sisal, also sisal-hemp, or, as it is sometimes known,\r\nMexican grass, has for some years past been used in the trade in\r\nincreasing quantities as a substitute for abacá, which it somewhat\r\nresembles in appearance, though wanting that fine gloss which the\r\nlatter possesses. It is somewhat weaker, and costs from £5 to £10 less\r\nper ton; it is only used for ships' rigging. The refuse from it has\r\nbeen found an extremely useful adjunct to the materials ordinarily\r\nused in the manufacture of paper. The Technologist for July, 1865,\r\ncalls attention to the origin of this substitute, in a detailed\r\nessay differing essentially from the representations contained in the\r\n\"U. S. Agricultural Report\" published at Washington in 1870; and the\r\ngrowing importance of the article, and the ignorance prevailing abroad\r\nas to its extraction, may render a short account of it acceptable. The\r\ndescription shows the superior fineness of the abacá fiber, but not\r\nits greater strength. [229]\r\n\r\n[Varieties of sisal.] Sisal-hemp, which is named after the export\r\nharbor of Sisal (in the north-western part of the peninsula), is by\r\nfar the most important product of Yucatan; and this rocky, sun-burnt\r\ncountry seems peculiarly adapted to the growth of the fiber. In Yucatan\r\nthe fiber is known as jenequem, as indeed the plant is obtained from\r\nit. Of the latter there are seven sorts or varieties for purposes of\r\ncultivation; only two, the first and seventh, are also to be found\r\nin a wild state. First, Chelem, apparently identical with Agave\r\nangustifolia; this ranks first. Second, Yaxci (pronounced Yachki;\r\nfrom yax, green, and tri, agave), the second in order; this is used\r\nonly for fine weaving. Third, Sacci (pronounced Sakki; sack, white),\r\nthe most important and productive, supplying almost exclusively the\r\nfiber for exportation; each plant yields annually twenty-five leaves,\r\nweighing twenty-five pounds, from which is obtained one pound of clear\r\nfiber. Fourth, Chucumci, similar to No. 3, but coarser. Fifth, Babci;\r\nthe fiber very fair, but the leaves rather small, therefore not very\r\nproductive. Sixth, Citamci (pronounced Kitamki; kitam, hog); neither\r\ngood nor productive. Seventh, Cajun or Cajum, probably Fourcroya\r\ncubensis; leaves small, from four to five inches long.\r\n\r\n[Machine-spinning.] The cultivation of sisal has only in recent times\r\nbeen prosecuted vigorously; and the extraction of the fiber from the\r\nleaves, and the subsequent spinning for ships' rigging, are already\r\ndone by steam-machinery. This occupation is especially practiced by\r\nthe Maya Indians, a memorial of the Toltecs, who brought it with them\r\nupon their emigration from Mexico, where it was in vogue long before\r\nthe arrival of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[Profit.] The sisal cultivation yields an annual profit of 95 per\r\ncent. A mecate, equal to five hundred seventy-six square yards (varas),\r\ncontains sixty-four plants, giving sixty-four pounds of clear fiber,\r\nof the value of $3.84; which, after deducting $1.71, the cost of\r\nobtaining it, leaves $2.13 remaining. The harvesting commences from\r\nfour to five years after the first laying out of the plantation,\r\nand continues annually for about fifty or sixty years.\r\n\r\n[Banana substitute unsatisfactory.] In tropical countries there\r\nis scarcely a hut to be seen without banana trees surrounding it;\r\nand the idea presented itself to many to utilize the fiber of these\r\nplants, at that time entirely neglected, which might be done by the\r\nmere labor of obtaining it; besides which, the little labor required\r\nfor their proper cultivation is quickly and amply repaid by their\r\nabundant fruitfulness. [230]\r\n\r\nThis idea, however, under the existing circumstances, would certainly\r\nnot be advantageous in the Philippines, as it does not pay to obtain\r\nbast from the genuine abacá plant as soon as it has borne fruit. The\r\nfiber of the edible banana might very well be used as material for\r\npaper-making, though obtaining it would cost more than the genuine\r\nbandala.\r\n\r\n[Fiber-extracting machinery.] In the Report of the Council of the\r\nSociety of Arts, London, May 11, 1860, attention was called to a\r\nmachine invented by F. Burke, of Montserrat, for obtaining fiber from\r\nbanana and other endogenous plants. While all the earlier machines\r\nworked the fiber parallelwise, this one operated obliquely on it;\r\nthe consequence of which was that it was turned out particularly\r\nclear. With this machine, from seven to nine per cent. of fibrous\r\nsubstance may be obtained from the banana. The Tropical Fiber Company\r\nhave sent these machines to Demerara, also to Java and other places,\r\nwith the design of spinning the fiber of the edible banana, and also\r\nto utilize some portions of the plant as materials in the manufacture\r\nof paper. Proofs have already been brought forward of fiber obtained\r\nin this manner in Java, the value of which to the spinner has been\r\nreckoned at from £20 to £25. It does not appear, however, that these\r\npromising experiments have led to any important results; at least,\r\nthe consular reports which have come to hand contain no information\r\non the subject. In the obtaining of bandala in the Philippines this\r\nmachine has not yet been used; nor has it even been seen, though the\r\nEnglish consul, in his latest report, complains that all the hitherto\r\ningeniously constructed machines have proved virtually useless.\r\n\r\nThe bast of the edible banana continues still to be used in the\r\nPhilippines, notwithstanding that the plants, instead of being grown,\r\nas in many parts of America, in large well-tended gardens, are here\r\nscattered around the huts; but the forwarding of the raw material,\r\nthe local transport, and the high freightage will always render this\r\nmaterial too expensive for the European market (considering always its\r\nvery ordinary quality)--£10 per ton at the very least; while \"Sparto\r\ngrass\" (Lygaeum spartum, Loeffl.), [Paper-making materials.] which\r\nwas imported some few years since in considerable quantities for\r\nthe purpose of paper-making, costs in London only £5 per ton. [231]\r\nThe jute (Corchurus casularis) coffee-sacks supply another cheap paper\r\nmaterial. These serve in the fabrication of strong brown packing paper,\r\nas the fiber will not stand bleaching. According to P. Symmonds,\r\nthe United States in recent years have largely used bamboo. The rind\r\nof the Adansonia digitata also yields an extremely good material;\r\nin particular, paper made entirely from New Zealand flax deserves\r\nconsideration, being, by virtue of its superior toughness, eminently\r\nsuited for \"bill paper.\"\r\n\r\n[Preferability of discarded cloth.] It must not be overlooked that, in\r\nthe manufacture of paper, worn linen and cotton rags are the very best\r\nmaterials that can be employed, and make the best paper. Moreover,\r\nthey are generally to be had for the trouble of collecting them,\r\nafter they have once covered the cost of their production in the\r\nform of clothing materials; when, through being frayed by repeated\r\nwashings, they undergo a preparation which particularly adapts them\r\nto the purpose of paper-making.\r\n\r\n[Increasing use of wood and straw.] The more paper-making progresses,\r\nthe more are ligneous fibers brought forward, particularly wood and\r\nstraw, which produce really good pastes; all the raw materials being\r\nimported from a distance. That England takes so much sparto is easily\r\nexplained by the fact that she has very little straw of her own,\r\nfor most of the grain consumed by her is received from abroad in a\r\ngranulated condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\n[Tobacco revenue.] Of all the productions of the country tobacco is\r\nthe most important, so far (at least) as concerns the Government,\r\nwhich have the cultivation of this plant, its manipulation, and sale,\r\nthe subjects of an extensive and strictly guarded monopoly, and derives\r\na very considerable portion of the public revenue therefrom. [232]\r\nAs to the objections raised against this revenue on the score of its\r\nbeing opposed to justice and morality, many other sources of revenue in\r\nthe colonial budget might be condemned (such as the poll-tax, gaming\r\nand opium licenses, the brandy trade, and the sale of indulgences);\r\nyet none is so invidious and pernicious as the tobacco monopoly.\r\n\r\n[Injustice of the monopoly.] Often in the course of this narrative\r\nof my travels I have had occasion to commend the clemency of the\r\nSpanish Government. In glaring contrast therewith, however, stands the\r\nmanagement of the tobacco regulations. They appropriated the fields of\r\nthe peasantry without the slightest indemnification--fields which had\r\nbeen brought under cultivation for their necessary means of sustenance;\r\nforced them, under penalty of bodily punishment, to raise, on the\r\nconfiscated property, an article which required an immense amount\r\nof trouble and attention, and which yielded a very uncertain crop;\r\nand they then valued the harvested leaves arbitrarily and without any\r\nappeal, and, in the most favorable case, paid for them at a nominal\r\nprice fixed by themselves. To be paid at all, indeed, appears to have\r\nbeen a favor, for it has not been done in full now for several years in\r\nsuccession. Spain regularly remains indebted to the unlucky peasants\r\nin the amount of the miserable pittance allowed, from one year's end\r\nto another. The Government ordered the officials to exact a higher\r\nreturn from the impoverished population of the tobacco districts; and\r\neven rewarded informers who, after pointing out fields already owned,\r\nbut which were considered suitable to the cultivation of tobacco,\r\nwere installed into possession of the proclaimed lands in the place\r\nof the original owners.\r\n\r\nFor proofs of these accusations, one need only peruse a few paragraphs\r\ncontained in the following stringent regulations, entitled \"General\r\nInstructions,\" [233] and, further, a few extracts from the official\r\ndispatches of Intendant-General Agius to the Colonial Minister:-- [234]\r\n\r\n[Résumé of regulations] Cap. 25, § 329. The compulsory system of\r\ncultivation in Cagayan, New Vizcaya, Gapan, Igorots, and Abra to\r\nremain in force.\r\n\r\n§ 331. The Director-General of the Government is authorized to\r\nextend compulsory labor to the other provinces, or to abolish it\r\nwhere already introduced. These instructions may be altered wholly\r\nor in part as occasion requires.\r\n\r\n§ 332. Prices may be either increased or lowered.\r\n\r\n§ 337. Claims or actions concerning the possession of tobacco\r\nlands pending before the usual tribunal shall not prevent such\r\nlands from being used for the purposes of tobacco cultivation, the\r\npresent proprietor being under strict obligation to continue the\r\ncultivation either in person or by substitute. (If he omits to do so,\r\nthe magistrate or judge takes upon himself to appoint such substitute.)\r\n\r\n§ 351. The collectors have received denuncies, i.e. information,\r\nthat land adapted to tobacco growing is lying fallow, and that it is\r\nprivate property. In case such land is really suitable to the purposes\r\nof tobacco cultivation, the owners thereof are hereby summoned to\r\ncultivate the same with tobacco in preference to anything else. At\r\nthe expiration of a certain space of time the land in question\r\nis to be handed over to the informer. Be it known, however, that,\r\nnotwithstanding these enactments, the possessory title is not lost to\r\nthe owner, but he is compelled to relinquish all rights and usufruct\r\nfor three years.\r\n\r\nCap. 27, § 357. An important duty of the collector is to insure the\r\ngreatest possible extension of the tobacco cultivation upon all\r\nsuitable lands, but in particular upon those which are specially\r\nconvenient and fertile. Lands which, although suitable for tobacco\r\ngrowing, were previously planted with rice or corn, shall, as far\r\nas practicable, be replaced by forest clearings, in order, as far as\r\npossible, to prevent famine and to bring the interests of the natives\r\ninto harmony with those of the authorities.\r\n\r\n§ 351. In order that the work which the tobacco cultivation requires\r\nmay not be neglected by the natives, and that they may perform the\r\nfield work necessary for their sustenance, it is ordered that every\r\ntwo persons working together shall, between them cultivate eight\r\nthousand square varas, that is, two and one-half acres of tobacco land.\r\n\r\n§ 362. Should this arrangement fail to be carried out either through\r\nage, sickness, or death, it shall be left to the priest of the district\r\nto determine what quantity of work can be accomplished by the little\r\nchildren, having regard to their strength and number.\r\n\r\n§ 369. Every collector who consigns from his district 1,000 fardos\r\nmore than in former years, shall receive for the overplus a double\r\ngratuity, but this only where the proportion of first-class leaves\r\nhas not decreased.\r\n\r\n§ 370. The same gratuity will be bestowed when there is no diminution\r\nin bulk, and one-third of the leaves is of first-class quality.\r\n\r\nThe following sections regulate the action of the local authorities:--\r\n\r\n§ 379. Every governor must present annually a list, revised by the\r\npriest of the district, of all the inhabitants in his district of both\r\nsexes, and of those of their children who are old enough to help in\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\n§ 430. The officers shall forward the emigrants on to Cagayan and\r\nNueva Vizcaya, and will be entrusted with $5 for that purpose, which\r\nmust be repaid by each individual, as they cannot be allowed to remain\r\nindebted in their province.\r\n\r\n§ 436. Further it is ordered by the Buen Gobierno (good government)\r\nthat no Filipino shall be liable for a sum exceeding $5, incurred\r\neither as a loan or a simple debt. Thus the claim of a higher sum\r\ncan not impede emigration.\r\n\r\n§ 437. The Hacienda (Public Treasury) shall pay the passage money\r\nand the cost of maintenance from Ilocos.\r\n\r\n§ 438. They are to be provided with the means of procuring cattle,\r\ntools, etc., until the first harvest (although the Indian is only\r\nliable for $5).\r\n\r\n§ 439. Such advances are, it is true, personal and individual; but,\r\nin the case of death or flight of the debtor, the whole village is\r\nto be liable for the amount due.\r\n\r\n[Tobacco from Mexico.] Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, L.) was introduced\r\ninto the Philippines soon after the arrival of the Spaniards by the\r\nmissionaries, who brought the seed with them from Mexico. [235] The\r\nsoil and climate being favorable to its production, and the pleasure\r\nderived from it being speedily discovered by the natives, naturally\r\nassisted in its rapid adoption. Next to the Cuban tobacco and a\r\nfew sorts of Turkish [236]it is admitted to be the best; and in the\r\ncolony it is asserted by competent judges that it would soon surpass\r\nall others, if the existing regulations were abolished and free trade\r\nestablished. There can be no doubt in the minds of impartial observers\r\nthat the quality and quantity of the produce might be considerably\r\nincreased by such a change; on the other hand, many of the prejudiced\r\nofficials certainly maintain the direct contrary. The real question is,\r\nto what extent these expectations may be realized in the fulfilment of\r\nsuch a measure; of course, bearing in mind that the judgment is swayed\r\nby a strong desire for the abolition of a system which interferes at\r\npresent with their prospects of gain. But the fact is that, even now,\r\nthe native grown tobacco, notwithstanding all the defects inseparable\r\nfrom an illicit trade, is equal to that produced by the [High grade\r\nof Philippine product.] Government officials in their own factories,\r\nand is valued at the same rate with many of the Havana brands; and\r\nthe Government cigars of the Philippines are preferred to all others\r\nthroughout Eastern Asia. Indeed, rich merchants, to whom a difference\r\nof price is no object, as a rule take the Manila cigars before Havanas.\r\n\r\n[Manila tobacco handicapped.] According to Agius (\"Memoria,\" 1871), in\r\nthe European market the Manila tobacco was admitted to be without any\r\nrival, with the sole exception of the Vuelta abajo of Cuba; and most\r\ncertainly in the Asiatic and Oceanic ports its superior quality was\r\nundisputed, as the Havana tobacco loses its flavor on the long voyage\r\nto these countries; but now, from year to year, it is surely losing its\r\nreputation. If, then, the Manila cigars have not hitherto succeeded in\r\nmaking themselves acceptable in Europe on account of their inferiority,\r\nthe blame is attributable simply to the system of compulsory labor,\r\nand the chronic insolvency of the Insular Treasury, whilst the produce\r\nof other tobacco countries has steadily progressed in quality in\r\nconsequence of free competition. The fame of the Manila cigars may\r\nalso have suffered in some slight measure from the wide-spread,\r\nthough perfectly erroneous, idea that they contained opium.\r\n\r\n[Hampered by government restrictions.] How greatly the produce might be\r\nincreased by means of free trade is shown under other circumstances by\r\nthe example of Cuba. At the time when the Government there monopolized\r\nthe tobacco trade, the crops were only partly sufficient to cover\r\nthe home consumption; whereas, at the present time, Cuba supplies\r\nall the markets of the world. [237] The decision of Captain-General\r\nDe la Gandara upon this question is in the highest degree worthy\r\nof notice. In a MS. Report to the Colonial Minister, March, 1858,\r\nconcerning a measure for rendering the regulations of the tobacco\r\nmonopoly still more stringent, he says: \"If the tobacco cultivation\r\nis placed without restriction into the hands of private traders,\r\nwe shall most probably, in a few years, be in a position to command\r\nnearly all the markets in the world.\" Most of the islands produce\r\ntobacco. According to the quality of the produce, the tobacco\r\nprovinces rank in the following order: First, Cagayan and Isabela;\r\nSecond, Igorots; Third, Island of Mindanao; Fourth, Bisayas; Fifth,\r\nNueva Ecija.\r\n\r\n[Origin of monopoly.] From the Government Order, dated November 20,\r\n1625, it is evident that even at that early period the sale of betel\r\nnut, palm spirit (toddy), tobacco, etc., was a Government monopoly: but\r\nit does not seem to have been very strictly carried out. The tobacco\r\nmonopoly, as it stands at present, the whole trade of which from the\r\nsowing of the seedling plants to the sale of the manufactured article\r\nis exclusively in the hands of the Government, was first introduced by\r\nCaptain-General José Basco y Vargas. And a Government Order, under date\r\nof January 9, 1780 (confirmed by Departmental Regulations, December\r\n13, 1781), further enacted that the tobacco regulations should be\r\nextended to the Philippine Islands, in like manner as in all Spanish\r\npossessions in this and the other hemisphere (de uno y otto mundo).\r\n\r\n[Governor Basco's innovations.] Before the administration of this\r\nvery jealous Governor, for a period of two hundred years the colony\r\nreceived annual contributions from New Spain (Situado de Nueva\r\nEspaña). In order to relieve the Spanish Exchequer, from this charge\r\nBasco introduced (at that time national economic ideas prevailed of\r\nmaking the natural resources of a State supply its immediate wants)\r\na plan upon which, fifty years later, Java modelled its \"Culture\r\nSystem.\" In the Philippines, however, the conditions for this system\r\nwere less favorable. In addition to the very slight submissiveness\r\nof the population, there were two great obstacles in the opposition\r\nof the priests and the want of trustworthy officials. Of all the\r\nprovincial trades brought into existence by the energy of Basco, the\r\nindigo cultivation is the only one that remains in the hands of private\r\nindividuals, the tobacco trade still being a Government monopoly. [238]\r\nBasco first of all confined the monopoly to the provinces immediately\r\ncontiguous to the capital, in all of which the cultivation of tobacco\r\nwas forbidden under penalty of severe punishment, except by persons\r\nduly authorized and in the service of the Government. [239] In the\r\nother provinces the cultivation was to a certain extent permitted;\r\nbut the supply remaining after deduction of what was consumed in each\r\nprovince was to be sold to the Government only.\r\n\r\n[Speculation with public funds.] In the Bisayas the magistrates\r\npurchased the tobacco for the Government and paid for it at the rate\r\npreviously fixed by the Government factories at Manila; and they\r\nwere allowed to employ the surplus money of the Government treasury\r\nchest for this purpose. A worse system than this could scarcely be\r\ndevised. Officials, thinking only of their own private advantage,\r\nsuffered no competition in their provinces, employed their official\r\npower to oppress the producer to the utmost extent, and thereby\r\nnaturally checked the production; and the Government treasury chest\r\nconsequently suffered frequent losses through bankruptcies, inasmuch\r\nas the magistrates, who drew a salary of $600 and paid a license\r\nof from $100 to $300 for the right of trading, in order to make\r\nmoney quickly, engaged in the most hazardous speculations. In 1814\r\nthis stupid arrangement was first put an end to; and forthwith the\r\ntobacco supplies from the Bisayas increased, through the competition\r\nof the private dealers, who then, for the first time, had the power of\r\npurchase; and from 1839 the planters were empowered to obtain higher\r\nprices than those afforded by the greedy monopolizing magistrates. At\r\npresent, the following general regulations are in force, subject,\r\nhowever, to continual variation in details.\r\n\r\n[Changes bring improvement.] By a Departmental Order, September 5,\r\n1865, the cultivation of tobacco was permitted in all the provinces,\r\nthough the produce was allowed to be sold only to the Government at\r\nthe price regulated by them. The wholesale purchases are made in Luzon\r\nand the adjacent islands in fardos, [240] by \"colleccion,\" that is,\r\ndirect through the finance officials, who have the management of\r\nthe plants from the sowing; but in the Bisayas by acopio; that is,\r\nthe Government officials buy up the tobacco tendered by the growers\r\nor speculators by the cwt.\r\n\r\n[Different usages in Bisayas and Mindanao.] In the Bisayas and in\r\nMindanao everybody is allowed to manufacture cigars for his own\r\nparticular use, though trade therein is strictly prohibited; and\r\nadvances to the tobacco growers are also made there; while in Luzon\r\nand the neighboring islands the Government provides seed and seedling\r\nplants. Here, however, no land which is adapted to the cultivation\r\nof tobacco is allowed to be used for any other purpose of agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Crude system of grading.] As the Financial Administration is\r\nunable to classify the tobacco at its true value, as might be done\r\nwere free competition permitted, they have adopted the expedient of\r\ndetermining the price by the size of the leaves; the care necessary\r\nto be bestowed upon the training of the plants in order to produce\r\nleaves of the required size being at least a guarantee of a certain\r\namount of proper attention and handling, even if it be productive of\r\nno other direct good. [241]\r\n\r\n[Burden knowingly increased.] It is well known at Madrid how the\r\ntobacco monopoly, by oppressing the wretched population, interferes\r\nwith the prosperity of the colony; yet, to the present day, the\r\nGovernment measures have been so arranged as to exact a still larger\r\ngain from this very impolitic source of revenue.\r\n\r\n[\"Killing the goose that lays the golden egg.\"] A Government Order of\r\nJanuary, 1866, directed the tobacco cultivation in the Philippines to\r\nbe extended as much as possible, in order to satisfy the requirements\r\nof the colony, the mother country, and also the export trade;\r\nand in the memorial already quoted, \"reforms\" are proposed by the\r\nCaptain-General, in the spirit of the goose with golden eggs. By\r\ngrafting new monopolies upon those already existing, he believes that\r\nthe tobacco produce can be increased from 182,102 cwt. (average of\r\nthe years 1860 to 1857) to 500,000, and even 800,000 cwt. Meantime,\r\nwith a view to obtaining increased prices, the Government resolved\r\nto export the tobacco themselves to the usual markets for sale; and\r\nin the year 1868 this resolution was really carried out. It was sent\r\nto London, where it secured so favorable a market that it was at once\r\ndecreed that no tobacco in Manila should thenceforth be sold at less\r\nthan $25 per cwt. [242] This decree, however, referred only to the\r\nfirst three qualities, the quantity of which decreased in a relative\r\nmeasure with the increased pressure upon the population. Even in\r\nthe table annexed to the record of La Gandara this is very clearly\r\nshown. Whilst the total produce for 1867 stood at 176,018 cwt. (not\r\nmuch under the average of the years 1860 to 1857, viz., 182,102 cwt.),\r\nthe tobacco of the first class had decreased in quantity since 1862\r\nfrom over 13,000 to less than 5,000 cwt.\r\n\r\n[Gift to Spain of unusable tobacco.] The fourth, fifth, and sixth\r\nclasses, the greater part of which would before have been burnt, but\r\nwhich now form no inconsiderable portion of the total crop, are in the\r\nopen markets positively unsaleable, and can be utilized only in the\r\nform of a bonus to Spain, which annually receives, under the title of\r\natenciones á la peninsula, upwards of 100,000 cwt. If the colony were\r\nnot compelled to pay half the freight of these gifts, Spain would\r\ncertainly ask to be relieved of these \"marks of attention.\" Seeing\r\nthat, according to the decision of the chief of the Government, the\r\ngreater portion of this tobacco is of such inferior quality that it\r\ncan find no purchaser at any price, it is impossible that its value\r\nshould cover either the cost of carriage or the customs duty. Moreover,\r\nthis tobacco tribute is a great burden on the colonial budget; which,\r\nin spite of all deficits, is charged with the expenses attending the\r\ncollection of the tobacco, its packing, its cost of local transport,\r\nand half the expense of its carriage to Europe.\r\n\r\n[De La Gandara's proposed reforms.] Dated in March, 1871,--the\r\nbeginning of a Golden Age, if De La Gandara's plans had been carried\r\nout and his expectations realized,--there exists an excellent\r\nstatement from the Intendant-General addressed to the Minister of\r\nColonies pointing out plainly to the chief of the Government the\r\ndisadvantages arising from this mode of administration, and urging the\r\nimmediate repeal of the monopoly. In the next place proof was adduced,\r\nsupported by official vouchers, that the profits derived from the\r\ntobacco monopoly were much smaller than usual. The total average\r\nreceipts of the tobacco administration for the five years 1855 to\r\n1869, according to official accounts, amounted to $5,367,262; for the\r\nyears 1866 to 1870, only $5,240,935. The expenses cannot be accurately\r\nestimated, inasmuch as there are no strict accounts obtainable; if,\r\nhowever, the respective expenses charged in the colonial budget are\r\nadded together, they amount to $3,717,322 of which $1,812,250 is for\r\npurchase of raw tobacco.\r\n\r\n[Slight real profit from monopoly.] Besides these expenses pertaining\r\nexclusively to the tobacco administration there are still many other\r\ndifferent items to be taken into account; yet the cost incurred in\r\nthis branch of the service would be saved, if not altogether, at\r\nleast largely, if the State surrendered the tobacco monopoly. The\r\ntotal of the disbursements must certainly, at the very lowest, be\r\nestimated at $4,000,000; so, therefore, the State receives only a net\r\nprofit of $1,357,000; but even this is not to be reckoned on in the\r\nfuture, for if the Government does not speedily cease carrying on this\r\ntrade, they will be forced into a very considerable and unavoidable\r\nexpense. To begin with, they must erect new factories and warehouses;\r\nbetter machinery must be bought; wages will have to be considerably\r\nincreased; and, above all, means must be devised to pay off the\r\nenormous sum of $1,600,000 in which the Government is indebted to the\r\npeasants for the crops of 1869 and 1870, and to assure cash payments\r\nfor future harvests. \"This is the only possible mode of preventing\r\nthe decay of the tobacco cultivation in the different provinces,\r\nas well as relieving the misery of the wretched inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\n[Suffering and law-breaking thru the monopoly.] Later Agius proved\r\nhow trifling in reality the arrears were on account of which the\r\nGovernment was abandoning the future of the colony, and showed the\r\nmisfortunes, of which I shall mention, these briefly, only a few,\r\nresulting from the monopoly. He represented that the people of the\r\ntobacco district, who were the richest and most contented of all in the\r\nArchipelago, found themselves plunged into the deepest distress after\r\nthe increase of the Government dues. They were, in fact, far more\r\ncruelly treated than the slaves in Cuba, who, from self-interested\r\nmotives, are well-nourished and taken care of; whereas in this case,\r\nthe produce of compulsory labor has to be delivered to the State at an\r\narbitrarily determined price; and even this price is paid only when\r\nthe condition of the treasury, which is invariably in difficulties,\r\npermits. Frequently their very means of subsistence failed them,\r\nin consequence of their being forbidden to carry on the cultivation;\r\nand the unfortunate people, having no other resources for the relief\r\nof their pressing necessities, were compelled to alienate the debtor's\r\nbond, which purchased the fruits of their enforced toil but had been\r\nleft unpaid. Thus, for an inconsiderable deficit of about $1,330,000,\r\nthe whole population of one of the richest provinces is thrown into\r\nabject misery; a deep-rooted hatred naturally arises between the people\r\nand their rulers; and incessant war ensues between the authorities\r\nand their subjects. Besides which, an extremely dangerous class of\r\nsmugglers have recently arisen, who even now do not confine themselves\r\nto mere smuggling, but who, on the very first opportunity presented by\r\nthe prevailing discontent, will band themselves together in one solid\r\nbody. The official administrators, too, are charged with gross bribery\r\nand corruption; which, whether true or not, occasions great scandal,\r\nand engenders increasing disrespect and distrust of the colonial\r\nadministration as well as of the Spanish people generally. [243]\r\n\r\n[Growing opposition to the monopoly.] The preceding memorial has\r\nbeen not only written, but also printed; and it seems to indicate\r\nthat gradually in Spain, and also in wider circles, people are\r\nbecoming convinced of the untenableness of the tobacco monopoly;\r\nyet, in spite of this powerful review, it is considered doubtful by\r\ncompetent judges whether it will be given up so long as there are any\r\napparent or appreciable returns derived therefrom. These acknowledged\r\nevils have long been known to the Colonial Government; but, from\r\nthe frequent changes of ministers, and the increasing want of money,\r\nthe Government is compelled, so long as they are in office, to use\r\nall possible means of obtaining profits, and to abstain from carrying\r\nout these urgent reforms lest their own immediate downfall should be\r\ninvolved therein. Let us, however, cherish the hope that increased\r\ndemand will cause a rise in the prices; a few particularly good crops,\r\nand other propitious circumstances, would relieve at once the Insular\r\nTreasury from its difficulties; and then the tobacco monopoly might be\r\ncheerfully surrendered. One circumstance favorable to the economical\r\nmanagement of the State that would be produced by the surrender of\r\nthe tobacco monopoly would be the abolition of the numerous army of\r\nofficials which its administration requires. This might, however,\r\noperate reversely in Spain. The number of place-hunters created\r\nmust be very welcome to the ministers in power, who thus have the\r\nopportunity of providing their creatures with profitable places,\r\nor of shipping off inconvenient persons to the Antipodes from the\r\nmother-country, free of cost. The colony, be it known, has not only\r\nto pay the salaries, but also to bear the cost of their outward and\r\nhomeward voyages. Any way, the custom is so liberally patronized that\r\noccasionally new places have to be created in order to make room for\r\nthe newly-arrived nominees. [244]\r\n\r\n[Wholesale rate highter than retail government.] At the time of\r\nmy visit, the royal factories could not turn out a supply of cigars\r\ncommensurate with the requirements of commerce; and this brought about\r\na peculiar condition of things; the wholesale dealer, who purchased\r\ncigars in very considerable quantities at the government auctions,\r\npaying higher than the retail rates at which he could buy them\r\nsingly in the estancia. In order, therefore, to prevent the merchants\r\ndrawing their stocks from the estancias, it was determined that only\r\na certain quantity should be purchased, which limit no merchant dared\r\nexceed. A very intricate system of control, assisted by espionage,\r\nhad to be employed in seeing that no one, through different agents and\r\ndifferent estancias, collected more than the authorised supply; and\r\nviolation of this rule, when discovered, was punished by confiscation\r\nof the offender's stock. Everybody was free to purchase cigars in the\r\nestancia, but nobody was permitted to sell a chest of cigars to an\r\nacquaintance at cost price. Several Spaniards with whom I have spoken\r\nconcerning these strange regulations maintained them to be perfectly\r\njust, as otherwise all the cigars would be carried off by foreigners,\r\nand they would not be able themselves in their own colony to smoke\r\na decent cigar.\r\n\r\n[Money juggling.] There was, as I afterwards learnt, a still more\r\nurgent reason for the existence of these decrees. The government\r\nvalued their own gold at sixteen dollars per ounce, while in commerce\r\nit fetched less, and the premium on silver had, at one time, risen\r\nto thirty-three per cent. Moreover, on account of the insufficient\r\nquantity of copper money for minor currency, the small change\r\nfrequently gained a premium on the silver dollar, so much so that by\r\nevery purchaser not less than half a dollar was realized. In exchanging\r\nthe dollar from five to fifteen per cent discount was charged; it was\r\nprofitable, therefore, to purchase cigars in the estancias with the\r\ngold ounce, and then to retail them in smaller quantities nominally\r\nat the rate of the estancias. Both premiums together might in an\r\nextreme case amount to as much as forty-three per cent. [245]\r\n\r\n[Directions for cultivating tobacco] Not being able to give a\r\ndescription of the cultivation of tobacco from personal knowledge\r\nand experience, I refer the reader to the following short extract\r\nfrom the Cartilla Agricola:--\r\n\r\nDirections for preparing and laying out the seed beds.--A suitable\r\npiece of land is to be enclosed quadrilaterally by boundaries,\r\nploughed two or three times, cleared of all weeds and roots, made\r\nsomewhat sloping, and surrounded by a shallow ditch, the bed of\r\nwhich is to be divided by drains about two feet wide. The soil of\r\nthe same must be very fine, must be ground almost as fine as powder,\r\notherwise it will not mix freely and thoroughly with the extremely\r\nfine tobacco seed. The seed is to be washed, and then suspended in\r\ncloths during the day, in order to allow the water to run off; after\r\nwhich it is to be mixed with a similar quantity of ashes, and strewn\r\ncarefully over the bed. The subsequent successful results depend\r\nentirely upon the careful performance of this work. From the time\r\nthe seed first begins to sprout, the beds must be kept very clean, in\r\ndry weather sprinkled daily, and protected from birds and animals by\r\nbrambles strewn over, and by means of light mats from storms and heavy\r\nrains. After two months the plants will be between five and six inches\r\nhigh, and generally have from four to six leaves; they must then be\r\nreplanted. This occurs, supposing the seed-beds to have been prepared\r\nin September, about the beginning or the middle of November. A second\r\nsowing takes place on the 15th of October, as much as a precaution\r\nagainst possible failure, as for obtaining plants for the lowlands.\r\n\r\nConcerning the land most advantageous to the tobacco and its\r\ncultivation. Replanting of the seedlings.--Land must be chosen of\r\nmiddling grain; somewhat difficult, calciferous soil is particularly\r\nrecommended, when it is richly fertilized with the remains of\r\ndecayed plants, and not less than two feet deep; and the deeper the\r\nroots are inserted the higher will the plant grow. Of all the land\r\nadapted to the tobacco cultivation, that in Cagayan is the best,\r\nas from the overflowing of the large streams, which occurs every\r\nyear, it is laid under water, and annually receives a new stratum\r\nof mud, which renders the soil particularly productive. Plantations\r\nprepared upon such soil differ very materially from those less\r\nfavored and situated on a higher level. In the former the plants\r\nshoot up quickly as soon as the roots strike; in the latter they\r\ngrow slowly and only reach a middling height. Again in the fertile\r\nsoil the plants produce quantities of large, strong, juicy leaves,\r\ngiving promise of a splendid harvest. In the other case the plants\r\nremain considerably smaller and grow sparsely. Sometimes, however,\r\neven the lowlands are flooded in January and February, and also in\r\nMarch, when the tobacco has already been transplanted, and grown to\r\nsome little height. In that event everything is irreparably lost,\r\nparticularly if the flood should occur at a time when it is too late\r\nto lay out new plantations. High-lying land also must, therefore, be\r\ncultivated, in the hope that by very careful attention it may yield\r\na similar return. In October these fields must be ploughed three or\r\nfour times, and harrowed twice or thrice. On account of the floods,\r\nthe lowlands cannot be ploughed until the end of December, or the\r\nmiddle of January; when the work is light and simple. The strongest\r\nplants in the seed-beds are chosen, and set in the prepared grounds\r\nat a distance of three feet from each other, care being taken that\r\nthe earth clinging to the roots is not shaken off.\r\n\r\nOf the care necessary to be bestowed upon the plants.--In the east a\r\nlittle screen, formed by two clods, is to be erected, with a view to\r\nprotecting the plant from the morning sun, and retaining the dew for\r\na longer time. The weeds to be carefully exterminated, and the wild\r\nshoots removed. A grub which occasionally appears in great numbers is\r\nparticularly dangerous. Rain is very injurious immediately before the\r\nripening, when the plants are no longer in a condition to secrete the\r\ngummy substance so essential to the tobacco, which, being soluble in\r\nwater, would be drawn off by the action of the rain. Tobacco which has\r\nbeen exposed to bad weather is always deficient in juice and flavor,\r\nand is full of white spots, a certain sign of its bad quality. The\r\ninjury is all the greater the nearer the tobacco is to its ripening\r\nperiod; the leaves hanging down to the ground then decay, and must\r\nbe removed. If the subsoil is not deep enough, a carefully tended\r\nplant will turn yellow, and nearly wither away. In wet seasons this\r\ndoes not occur so generally, as the roots in insufficient depth are\r\nenabled to find enough moisture.\r\n\r\nCutting and manipulation of the leaves in the drying shed.--The\r\ntopmost leaves ripen first; they are then of a dark yellow color, and\r\ninflexible. They must be cut off as they ripen, collected into bundles,\r\nand brought to the shed in covered carts. In wet or cloudy weather,\r\nwhen the nightly dews have not been thoroughly evaporated by the sun,\r\nthey must not be cut. In the shed the leaves are to hang upon cords or\r\nsplit Spanish cane, with sufficient room between them for ventilation\r\nand drying. The dried leaves are then laid in piles, which must not\r\nbe too big, and frequently turned over. Extreme care must be taken\r\nthat they do not become overheated and ferment too strongly. This\r\noperation, which is of the utmost importance to the quality of the\r\ntobacco, demands great attention and skill, and must be continued\r\nuntil nothing but an aromatic smell of tobacco can be noticed coming\r\nfrom the leaves; but the necessary skill for this manipulation is only\r\nto be acquired by long practice, and not from any written instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\n[Importance of Chinese.] An important portion of the population\r\nremains to be discussed, viz. the Chinese, who are destined to play a\r\nremarkable part, inasmuch as the development of the land-cultivation\r\ndemanded by the increasing trade and commercial intercourse can be\r\naffected only by Chinese industry and perseverance. Manila has always\r\nbeen a favorite place for Chinese immigrants; and neither the hostility\r\nof the people, nor oppressing and prohibitory decrees for a long time\r\nby the Government, not even the repeated massacres, have been able\r\nto prevent their coming. The position of the Islands, south-east of\r\ntwo of the most important of the Chinese provinces, must necessarily\r\nhave brought about a trade between the two countries very early, as\r\nships can make the voyage in either direction with a moderate wind,\r\nas well in the south-west as the north-east monsoon. [Early Chinese\r\nAssociations.] In a few old writers may even be found the assertion\r\nthat the Philippine Islands were at one time subject to the dominion of\r\nChina; and Father Gaubil (Lettres Edifiantes) mentions that Jaung-lo\r\n(of the Ming dynasty) maintained a fleet consisting of 30,000 men,\r\nwhich at different times proceeded to Manila. The presence of their\r\nships as early as the arrival of Magellan in the extreme east\r\nof the archipelago, as well as the China plates and earthenware\r\nvessels discovered in the excavations, plainly show that the trade\r\nwith China had extended far earlier to the most distant islands of\r\nthe archipelago. It formed the chief support of the young Spanish\r\ncolony, and, after the rise of the Encomiendas, was nearly the only\r\nsource of its prosperity. It was feared that the junks would offer\r\ntheir cargoes to the Dutch if any obstacle was put in the way of\r\ntheir coming to Manila. The colony certainly could not maintain its\r\nposition without the \"Sangleys,\" [246] who came annually in great\r\nnumbers in the junks from China, and spread all over the country and\r\nin the towns as [Industrial and commercial activity.] shopkeepers,\r\nartisans, gardeners, and fishermen; besides which, they were the\r\nonly skillful and industrious workers, as the Filipinos under the\r\npriestly domination had forgotten altogether many trades in which\r\nthey had engaged in former times. I take these facts from Morga.\r\n\r\n[Unsuccessful attempts at restriction.] In spite of all this, the\r\nSpaniards have, from the very commencement, endeavored rigorously to\r\nlimit the number of the Chinese; who were then, as they are now, envied\r\nand hated by the natives for their industry, frugality, and cunning, by\r\nwhich means they soon became rich. They were an abomination, moreover,\r\nin the eyes of the priests as being irreclaimable heathens, whose\r\nexample prevented the natives from making progress in the direction\r\nof Christianity; and the government feared them on account of the\r\nstrong bond of union existing between them, and as being subjects of\r\nso powerful a nation, whose close proximity threatened the small body\r\nof Spaniards with destruction. [247] Fortunately for the latter, the\r\nMing dynasty, which at that time was hastening to its downfall, did\r\nnot think of conquest; but wickedly disposed powers which sprang into\r\nexistence upon their downfall brought the colony into extreme danger.\r\n\r\n[Limahong and the Mandarins' visit.] In the attack of the noted pirate,\r\nLimahong, in 1574, they escaped destruction only by a miracle; and\r\nsoon new dangers threatened them afresh. In 1603 a few mandarins came\r\nto Manila, under the pretence of ascertaining whether the ground\r\nabout Cavite was really of gold. They were supposed to be spies,\r\nand it was concluded, from their peculiar mission, that an attack\r\nupon the colony was intended by the Chinese.\r\n\r\n[Early massacre of Chinese.] The archbishop and the priests incited\r\nthe distrust which was felt against the numerous Chinese who were\r\nsettled in Manila. Mutual hate and suspicion arose; both parties feared\r\none another and prepared for hostilities. The Chinese commenced the\r\nattack; but the united forces of the Spaniards, being supported by\r\nthe Japanese and the Filipinos, twenty-three thousand, according\r\nto other reports twenty-five thousand, of the Chinese were either\r\nkilled or driven into the desert. When the news of this massacre\r\nreached China, a letter from the Royal Commissioners was sent to the\r\nGovernor of Manila. That noteworthy document shows in so striking a\r\nmanner how hollow the great government was at that time that I have\r\ngiven a literal translation of it at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[Chinese laborers limited.] After the extermination of the Chinese,\r\nfood and all Chinese other necessaries of life were difficult to\r\nobtain on account of the utter unreliability of the natives for work;\r\nbut by 1605 the number of Chinese [248] had again so increased that\r\na decree was issued limiting them to six thousand, \"these to be\r\nemployed in the cultivation of the country;\" while at the same time\r\ntheir rapid increase was taken advantage of by the captain-general\r\nfor his own interest, as he exacted eight dollars from each Chinaman\r\nfor permission to remain. In 1539 the Chinese population had risen to\r\nthirty thousand, according to other information, to forty thousand,\r\nwhen they revolted and were reduced to seven thousand. \"The natives,\r\nwho generally were so listless and indifferent, showed the utmost\r\neagerness in assisting in the [Another massacre.] massacre of the\r\nChinese, but more from hatred of this industrious people than from\r\nany feeling of friendship towards the Spaniards.\" [249]\r\n\r\n[The pirate Kog-seng.] The void occasioned by this massacre was\r\nsoon filled up again by Chinese immigrants; and in 1662 the colony\r\nwas once more menaced with a new and great danger, by the Chinese\r\npirate Kog-seng, who had under his command between eighty and one\r\nhundred thousand men, and who already had dispossessed the Dutch\r\nof the Island of Formosa. He demanded the absolute submission of\r\nthe Philippines; his sudden death, however, saved the colony, and\r\noccasioned a fresh outbreak of fury against the Chinese settlers in\r\nManila, a great number of whom were butchered in their own \"quarter\"\r\n(ghetto). [250] Some dispersed and hid themselves; a few in their\r\nterror plunged into the water or hanged themselves; and a great number\r\nfled in small boats to Formosa. [251]\r\n\r\n[Another expulsion.] In 1709 the jealousy against the Chinese once\r\nmore had reached such a height that they were accused of rebellion,\r\nand particularly of monopolizing the trades, and, with the exception\r\nof the most serviceable of the artisans and such of them as were\r\nemployed by the Government, they were once again expelled. Spanish\r\nwriters praise the salutariness of these measures; alleging that\r\n\"under the pretence of agriculture the Chinese carry on trade; they\r\nare cunning and careful, making money and sending it to China, so that\r\nthey defraud the Philippines annually of an enormous amount.\" Sonnerat,\r\nhowever, complains that art, trade, and commerce had not recovered\r\nfrom these severe blows; though, he adds, fortunately the Chinese,\r\nin spite of prohibitory decrees, are returning through the corrupt\r\nconnivance of the governor and officials.\r\n\r\n[Thrifty traders.] To the present day they are blamed as being\r\nmonopolists, particularly by the creoles; and certainly, by means\r\nof their steady industry and natural commercial aptitude, they\r\nhave appropriated nearly all the retail trade to themselves. The\r\nsale of European imported goods is entirely in their hands; and the\r\nwholesale purchase of the produce of the country for export is divided\r\nbetween the natives, creoles, and the Chinese, the latter taking about\r\none-half. Before this time only the natives and creoles were permitted\r\nto own ships for the purpose of forwarding the produce to Manila.\r\n\r\nIn 1757 the jealousy of the Spaniards broke out again in the form\r\nof a new order from Madrid, directing the expulsion of the Chinese;\r\nand in 1759 the decrees of banishment, which were repeatedly evaded,\r\nwere carried into effect: but, as the private interests of the\r\nofficials did not happen to coincide with those of the creole traders,\r\nthe consequence was that \"the Chinese soon streamed back again in\r\nincredible numbers,\" and made common cause with the English upon\r\ntheir invasion in 1762. [252] [Anda's and 1819 massacres.] Thereupon,\r\nSr. Anda commanded \"that all the Chinese in the Philippine Islands\r\nshould be hanged,\" which order was very generally carried out. [253]\r\nThe last great Chinese massacre took place in 1819, when the aliens\r\nwere suspected of having brought about the cholera by poisoning\r\nthe wells. The greater part of the Europeans in Manila also fell\r\nvictims to the fury of the populace, but the Spaniards generally were\r\nspared. The prejudice of the Spaniards, especially of the creoles,\r\nhad always been directed against the Chinese tradesmen, who interfered\r\nunpleasantly with the fleecing of the natives; and against this class\r\nin particular were the laws of limitation aimed. They would willingly\r\nhave let them develop the country by farming but the hostility of\r\nthe natives generally prevented this.\r\n\r\n[Expulsion of merchants from Manila.] A decree, issued in 1804,\r\ncommanded all Chinese shopkeepers to leave Manila within eight days,\r\nonly those who were married being allowed to keep shops; and their\r\nresidence in the provinces was permitted only upon the condition\r\nthat they confined themselves entirely to agriculture. Magistrates\r\nwho allowed these to travel in their districts were fined $200; the\r\ndeputy-governor $25; and the wretched Chinese were punished with from\r\ntwo to three years' confinement in irons.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 the penalties against the Chinese were somewhat mitigated,\r\nbut those against the magistrates were still maintained on account\r\nof their venality. In 1843 Chinese ships were placed upon terms of\r\nequality with those of other foreign countries (Leg. Ult., II.,\r\n476). In 1850 Captain-General Urbiztondo endeavored to introduce\r\nChinese colonial farming, and with this object promised a reduction\r\nof the taxes to all agricultural immigrants. Many Chinese availed\r\nthemselves of this opportunity in order to escape the heavy poll-tax;\r\nbut in general they soon betook themselves to trading once more.\r\n\r\n[Oppressive taxation.] Of late years the Chinese have not suffered\r\nfrom the terrible massacres which used formerly to overtake them;\r\nneither have they suffered banishment; the officials being content to\r\nsuppress their activity by means of heavy and oppressive taxes. For\r\ninstance, at the end of 1867 the Chinese shopkeepers were annually\r\ntaxed $50 for permission to send their goods to the weekly market;\r\nthis was in addition to a tax of from $12 to $100 on their occupations;\r\nand at the same time they were commanded thenceforth to keep their\r\nbooks in Spanish (English Consular Report, 1859).\r\n\r\n[Excellent element in population.] The Chinese remain true to their\r\ncustoms and mode of living in the Philippines, as they do everywhere\r\nelse. When they outwardly embrace Christianity, it is done merely to\r\nfacilitate marriage, or from some motive conducive to their worldly\r\nadvantage; and occasionally they renounce it, together with their\r\nwives in Manila, when about to return home to China. Very many of\r\nthem, however, beget families, are excellent householders, and their\r\nchildren in time form the most enterprising, industrious, and wealthy\r\nportion of the resident population.\r\n\r\n[Formidable competitors.] Invigorated by the severe struggle for\r\nexistence which they have experienced in their over-populated\r\ncountry, the Chinese appear to preserve their capacity for labor\r\nperfectly unimpaired by any climate. No nation can equal them in\r\ncontentedness, industry, perseverance, cunning, skill, and adroitness\r\nin trades and mercantile matters. When once they gain a footing, they\r\ngenerally appropriate the best part of the trade to themselves. In\r\nall parts of external India they have dislodged from every field\r\nof employment not only their native but, progressively, even their\r\nEuropean competitors. Not less qualified and successful are they in\r\nthe pursuance of agriculture than in trade. The emigration from the\r\ntoo thickly peopled empire of China has scarcely begun. As yet it is\r\nbut a small stream, but it will by-and-by pour over all the tropical\r\ncountries of the East in one mighty torrent, completely destroying all\r\nsuch minor obstacles as jealous interference and impotent precaution\r\nmight interpose.\r\n\r\n[Sphere of futureinflunce.] Over every section of remote India,\r\nin the South Sea, in the Indian Archipelago, in the states of South\r\nAmerica, the Chinese seem destined, in time, either to supplant every\r\nother element, or to found a mixed race upon which to stamp their\r\nindividuality. In the Western States of the Union their number is\r\nrapidly on the increase; and the factories in California are worked\r\nentirely by them, achieving results that cannot be accomplished by\r\nEuropean labor.\r\n\r\n[Mongolian vs. Caucasion in America.] One of the most interesting of\r\nthe many questions of large comprehensiveness which connect themselves\r\nwith the penetration of the Mongolian race into America, which up\r\ntill now it had been the fashion to regard as the inheritance of the\r\nCaucasians, is the relative capacity of labor possessed by both these\r\ntwo great races, who in the Western States of America have for the\r\nfirst time measured their mutual strength in friendly rivalry. Both\r\nare there represented in their most energetic individuality; [254]\r\nand every nerve will be strained in carrying on the struggle, inasmuch\r\nas no other country pays for labor at so high a rate.\r\n\r\n[Efficiency and reliability of Chinese labor.] The conditions, however,\r\nare not quite equal, as the law places certain obstacles in the way of\r\nthe Chinese. The courts do not protect them sufficiently from insult,\r\nwhich at times is aggravated into malicious manslaughter through\r\nthe ill-usage of the mob, who hate them bitterly as being reserved,\r\nuncompanionable workers. Nevertheless, the Chinese immigrants take\r\ntheir stand firmly. The western division of the Pacific Railway has\r\nbeen chiefly built by the Chinese, who, according to the testimony of\r\nthe engineers, surpass workmen of all other nationalities in diligence,\r\nsobriety, and good conduct. What they lack in physical power they\r\nmake up for in perseverance and working intelligently together. The\r\nunique and nearly incredible performance that took place on April 28,\r\n1859, when ten miles of railway track were laid in eleven working\r\nhours along a division of land which had in no way been prepared\r\nbeforehand, was accomplished by Chinese workmen; and indeed only by\r\nthem could it have been practicable. [255]\r\n\r\n[Chinese cleverness and industry.] Of course, the superiority of the\r\nEuropean in respect Chinese of the highest intellectual faculties is\r\nnot for a moment to be doubted; but, in all branches of commercial\r\nlife in which cleverness and perservering industry are necessary to\r\nsuccess, the Chinese certainly appear entitled to the award. To us\r\nit appears that the influx of Chinese must certainly sooner or later\r\nkindle a struggle between capital and labor, in order to set a limit\r\nupon demands perceptibly growing beyond moderation.\r\n\r\n[Chinese problem in America.] The increasing Chinese immigration\r\nalready intrudes upon the attention of American statesmen questions of\r\nthe utmost social and political importance. What influence will this\r\nentirely new and strange element exercise over the conformation of\r\nAmerican relations? Will the Chinese found a State in the States, or go\r\ninto the Union on terms of political equality with the other citizens,\r\nand form a new race by alliance with the Caucasian element? These\r\nproblems, which can only be touched upon here in a transitory form,\r\nhave been dealt with in a masterly manner by Pumpelly, in his work\r\nAcross America and Asia, published in London in 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of the Commissary-General of Chinchew to Don Pedro De Acuña,\r\nGovernor of the Philippines\r\n\r\nTo the powerful Captain-General of Luzon:\r\n\r\n\"Having been given to understand that the Chinese who proceeded to\r\nthe kingdom of Luzon in order to buy and sell had been murdered by\r\nthe Spaniards, I have investigated the motives for these massacres,\r\nand begged the Emperor to exercise justice upon those who had engaged\r\nin these abominable offences, with a view to security in the future.\r\n\r\n\"In former years, before my arrival here as royal commissioner, a\r\nChinese merchant named Tioneg, together with three mandarins, went\r\nwith the permission of the Emperor of China from Luzon to Cavite,\r\nfor the purpose of prospecting for gold and silver; which appears to\r\nhave been an excuse, for he found neither gold nor silver; I thereupon\r\nprayed the Emperor to punish this imposter Tioneg, thereby making\r\npatent the strict justice which is exercised in China.\r\n\r\n\"It was during the administration of the ex-Viceroy and Eunuchs\r\nthat Tioneg and his companion, named Yanglion, uttered the untruth\r\nalready stated; and subsequently I begged the Emperor to transmit\r\nall the papers bearing upon the matter, together with the minutes\r\nof Tioneg's accusation; when I myself examined the before-mentioned\r\npapers, and knew that everything that the accused Tioneg had said\r\nwas utterly untrue.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote to the Emperor and stated that, on account of the untruth\r\nwhich Tioneg had been guilty of, the Castilians entertained the\r\nsuspicion that he wished to make war upon them, and that they,\r\nunder this idea, had murdered more than thirty thousand Chinese in\r\nLuzon. The Emperor, complying with my request, punished the accused\r\nYanglion, though he omitted to put him to death; neither was Tioneg\r\nbeheaded or confined in a cage. The Chinese people who had settled in\r\nLuzon were in no way to blame. I and others discussed this with the\r\nEmperor in order to ascertain what his pleasure was in this matter,\r\nas well as in another, namely, the arrival of two English ships on\r\nthe coast of Chinchew (Fukien or Amoy district)--a very dangerous\r\ncircumstance for China; and to obtain His Imperial Majesty's decision\r\nas to both these most serious matters.\r\n\r\n\"We also wrote to the Emperor that he should direct the punishment of\r\nboth these Chinese; and, in acknowledging our communication, he replied\r\nto us, in respect to the English ships which had arrived in China,\r\nthat in case they had come for the purpose of plundering, they should\r\nbe immediately commanded to depart thence for Luzon; and, with regard\r\nto the Luzon difficulty, that the Castilians should be advised to give\r\nno credence to rogues and liars from China; and both the Chinese who\r\nhad discovered the harbor to the English should be executed forthwith;\r\nand that in all other matters upon which we had written to him, our\r\nwill should be his. Upon receipt of this message by us--the Viceroy,\r\nthe Eunuch, and myself--we hereby send this our message to the Governor\r\nof Luzon, that his Excellency may know the greatness of the Emperor\r\nof China and of his Empire, for he is so powerful that he commands\r\nall upon which the sun and moon shine, and also that the Governor of\r\nLuzon may learn with what great wisdom this mighty empire is governed,\r\nand which power no one for many years has attempted to insult, although\r\nthe Japanese have sought to disturb the tranquillity of Korea, which\r\nbelongs to the Government of China. They did not succeed, but on the\r\ncontrary were driven out, and Korea has remained in perfect security\r\nand peace, which those in Luzon well know by report.\r\n\r\n\"Years ago, after we learnt that so many Chinese perished in Luzon\r\non account of Tioneg's lies, many of us mandarins met together,\r\nand resolved to leave it to the consideration of the Emperor to\r\ntake vengeance for so great a massacre; and we said as follows:--The\r\ncountry of Luzon is a wretched one, and of very little importance. It\r\nwas at one time only the abode of devils and serpents; and only\r\nbecause (within the last few years) so large a number of Chinese\r\nwent thither for the purpose of trading with the Castilians has it\r\nimproved to such an extent; in which improvement the accused Sangleyes\r\nmaterially assisted by hard labor, the walls being raised by them,\r\nhouses built, and gardens laid out, and other matters accomplished\r\nof the greatest use to the Castilians; and now the question is, why\r\nhas no consideration been paid for these services, and these good\r\noffices acknowledged with thanks, without cruelly murdering so many\r\npeople? And although we wrote to the King twice or thrice concerning\r\nthe circumstances, he answered us that he was indignant about the\r\nbefore-mentioned occurrences, and said for three reasons it is not\r\nadvisable to execute vengeance, nor to war against Luzon. The first\r\nis that for a long time till now the Castilians have been friends\r\nof the Chinese; the second, that no one can predict whether the\r\nCastilians or the Chinese would be victorious; and the third and last\r\nreason is, because those whom the Castilians have killed were wicked\r\npeople, ungrateful to China, their native country, their elders,\r\nand their parents, as they have not returned to China now for very\r\nmany years. These people, said the Emperor, he valued but little for\r\nthe foregoing reasons; and he commanded the Viceroy, the Eunuch, and\r\nmyself, to send this letter through those messengers, so that all in\r\nLuzon may know that the Emperor of China has a generous heart, great\r\nforbearance, and much mercy, in not declaring war against Luzon; and\r\nhis justice is indeed manifest, as he has already punished the liar\r\nTioneg. Now, as the Spaniards are wise and intelligent, how does it\r\nhappen that they are not sorry for having massacred so many people,\r\nfeeling no repentance thereat, and also are not kinder to those of the\r\nChinese who are still left? Then when the Castilians show a feeling of\r\ngood-will, and the Chinese and Sangleyes who left after the dispute\r\nreturn, and the indebted money is repaid, and the property which was\r\ntaken from the Sangleyes restored, then friendship will again exist\r\nbetween this empire and that, and every year trading-ships shall come\r\nand go; but if not, then the Emperor will allow no trading, but on the\r\ncontrary will at once command a thousand ships of war to be built,\r\nmanned with soldiers and relations of the slain, and will, with the\r\nassistance of other peoples and kingdoms who pay tribute to China, wage\r\nrelentless war, without quarter to any one; and upon its conclusion\r\nwill present the kingdom of Luzon to those who do homage to China.\r\n\r\n\"This letter is written by the Visitor-General on the 12th of the\r\nsecond month.\"\r\n\r\nA contemporary letter of the Ruler of Japan forms a somewhat notable\r\ncontrast:--\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of Daifusama, Ruler of Japan\r\n\r\n\"To the Governor Don Pedro de Acuña, in the year 1605:\r\n\r\n\"I have received two letters from your Excellency, as also all the\r\ndonations and presents described in the inventory. Amongst them was\r\nthe wine made from grapes, which I enjoyed very much. In former years\r\nyour Excellency requested that six ships might come here, and recently\r\nfour, which request I have always complied with.\r\n\r\n\"But my great displeasure has been excited by the fact that of the four\r\nships upon whose behalf your Excellency interposed, one from Antonio\r\nmade the journey without my permission. This was a circumstance of\r\ngreat audacity, and a mark of disrespect to me. Does your Excellency\r\nwish to send that ship to Japan without my permission?\r\n\r\n\"Independently of this, your Excellency and others have many times\r\ndiscussed with me concerning the antecedents and interests of Japan,\r\nand many other matters, your requests respecting which I cannot comply\r\nwith.

Wherefore, it is in no way fitting that your laws\r\nshould be promulgated and spread over Japan; and if, in consequence\r\nof these misunderstandings, your Excellency's friendship with the\r\nempire of Japan should cease, and with me likewise, it must be so,\r\nfor I must do that which I think is right, and nothing which is\r\ncontrary to my own pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, I have heard it frequently said, as a reproach, that many\r\nJapanese--wicked, corrupt men--go to your kingdom, remaining there\r\nmany years, and then return to Japan. This complaint excites my anger,\r\nand therefore I must request your Excellency henceforth not to allow\r\nsuch persons to return in the ships which trade here.

[256]\r\nBut it was not until 1564, [257] after many previous efforts had\r\nmiscarried, that Legaspi, who left New Spain with five ships, took\r\npossession of the Archipelago in the name of Philip II. The discoverer\r\nhad christened the islands after the sanctified Lazarus. This name,\r\nhowever, never grew into general use; [Numerous names.] the Spaniards\r\npersistently calling them the Western Islands--Islas del Poniente;\r\nand the Portuguese, Islas del Oriente. Legaspi gave them their present\r\nname [258] in honor of Philip II, who, in his turn, conferred upon\r\nthem the again extinct name of New Castile. [259] Legaspi first of\r\nall annexed Cebu, and then Panay; and six years later, in 1571, he\r\nfirst sub dued Manila, which was at that time a village surrounded by\r\npalisades, and commenced forthwith the construction of a fortified\r\ntown. The subjection of the remaining territory was effected so\r\nquickly that, upon the death of Legaspi (in August, 1572), all the\r\nwestern parts were in possession of the Spaniards. [Mindanao and\r\nSulu independent.] Numerous wild tribes in the interior, however,\r\nthe Mahomedan states of Mindanao and the Sulu group, for example,\r\nhave to this day preserved their independence. The character of\r\nthe people, as well as their political disposition, favored the\r\noccupancy. There was no mighty power, no old dynasty, no influential\r\npriestly domination to overcome, no traditions of national pride to\r\nsuppress. The natives were either heathens, or recently proselytized\r\nsuperficially to Islamism, and lived under numerous petty chiefs, who\r\nruled them despotically, made war upon one another, and were easily\r\nsubdued. Such a community was called Barangay; and it forms to this\r\nday, though in a considerably modified form, the foundation of the\r\nconstitutional laws. [Spanish improvemnts.] The Spaniards limited the\r\npower of the petty chiefs, upheld slavery, and abolished hereditary\r\nnobility and dignity, substituting in its place an aristocracy\r\ncreated by themselves for services rendered to the State; but they\r\ncarried out all these changes very gradually and cautiously. [260]\r\nThe old usages and laws, so long as they did not interfere with the\r\nnatural course of government, remained untouched and were operative\r\nby legal sanction; and even in criminal matters their validity was\r\nequal to those emanating from the Spanish courts. To this day the\r\nchiefs of Barangay, with the exception of those bearing the title\r\nof \"Don,\" have no privileges save exemption from the poll-tax and\r\nsocage service. [Unthinking policy of greed.] They are virtually\r\ntax-collectors, excepting that they are not paid for such service,\r\nand their private means are made responsible for any deficit. The\r\nprudence of such a measure might well be doubted, without regard to\r\nthe fact that it tempts the chiefs to embezzlement and extortion;\r\nand it must alienate a class of natives who would otherwise be a\r\nsupport to the Government.\r\n\r\n[High character of early administrators.] Since the measures adopted in\r\nalleviation of the conquest and occupancy succeeded in so remarkable\r\na manner, the governors and their subordinates of those days, at a\r\ntime when Spain was powerful and chivalrous, naturally appear to have\r\nbeen distinguished for wisdom and high spirit. Legaspi possessed both\r\nqualities in a marked degree. Hardy adventurers were tempted there,\r\nas in America, by privileges and inducements which power afforded\r\nthem; as well as by the hope, which, fortunately for the country, was\r\nnever realized, of its being rich in auriferous deposits. In Luzon,\r\nfor instance, Hernando Riquel stated that there were many goldmines in\r\nseveral places which were seen by the Spaniards; \"the ore is so rich\r\nthat I will not write any more about it, as I might possibly come under\r\na suspicion of exaggerating; but I swear by Christ that there is more\r\ngold on this island than there is iron in all Biscay.\" [Conquerors\r\non commission.] They received no pay from the kingdom; but a formal\r\nright was given them to profit by any territory which was brought into\r\nsubjection by them. Some of these expeditions in search of conquest\r\nwere enterprises undertaken for private gain, others for the benefit\r\nof the governor; and such service was rewarded by him with grants of\r\nlands, carrying an annuity, offices, and other benefits (encomiendas,\r\noficios y aprovechamientos). The grants were at first made for three\r\ngenerations (in New Spain for four), but were very soon limited\r\nto two; when De los Rios pointed this out as being a measure very\r\nprejudicial to the Crown, \"since they were little prepared to serve\r\nhis Majesty, as their grand-children had fallen into the most extreme\r\npoverty.\" After the death of the feoffee the grant reverted to the\r\nState; and the governor thereupon disposed of it anew.\r\n\r\n[The feudal \"encomiendas.\"] The whole country at the outset was\r\ncompletely divided into these livings, the defraying of which formed by\r\nfar the largest portion of the expenses of the kingdom. Investitures of\r\na similar nature existed, more or less, in a territory of considerable\r\nextent, the inhabitants of which had to pay tribute to the feoffee;\r\nand this tribute had to be raised out of agricultural produce, the\r\nvalue of which was fixed by the feudal lord at a very low rate, but\r\nsold by him to the Chinese at a considerable profit. The feudal lords,\r\nmoreover, were not satisfied with these receipts, but held the natives\r\nin a state of slavery, until forbidden by a Bull of Pope Gregory XIV,\r\ndated April 18, 1591. Kafir and negro slaves, whom the Portuguese\r\nimported by way of India, were, however, still permitted.\r\n\r\n[Extortions of encomenderos.] The original holders of feudal tenures\r\namassed considerable booty therefrom. Zuñiga relates that as early\r\nas the time of Lavezares, who was provisional governor between 1572\r\nand 1575, he visited the Bisayas and checked the covetousness of\r\nthe encomenderos, so that at least during his rule they relaxed\r\ntheir system of extortion. Towards the end of Sande's government\r\n(1575-80) a furious quarrel broke out between the priests and the\r\nencomenderos; the first preached against the oppression of the\r\nlatter, and memorialized Philip II thereon. The king commanded that\r\nthe natives should be protected, as the extortionate greed of the\r\nfeudal chiefs had exceeded all bounds; and the natives were then at\r\nliberty to pay their tribute either in money or in kind. The result of\r\nthis well-intentioned regulation appears to have produced a greater\r\nassiduity both in agriculture and trade, \"as the natives preferred\r\nto work without coercion, not on account of extreme want.\" [Salcedo\r\n\"most illustrious of the conquerors.\"] And here I may briefly refer to\r\nthe achievements of Juan de Salcedo, the most illustrious of all the\r\nconquerors. Supported by his grandfather, Legaspi, with forty-five\r\nSpanish soldiers, he fitted out an expedition at his own expense,\r\nembarked at Manila, in May, 1572, examined all parts of the west coast\r\nof the island, landed in all the bays which were accessible to his\r\nlight-draught ships, and was well received by the natives at most of\r\nthe places. He generally found great opposition in penetrating into\r\nthe interior; yet he succeeded in subduing many of the inland tribes;\r\nand when he reached Cape Bojeador, the north-west point of Luzon, the\r\nextensive territory which at present forms the provinces of Zambales,\r\nPangasinan, and Ilocos Notre and Sur, acknowledged the Spanish\r\nrule. The exhaustion of his soldiers obliged Salcedo to return. In\r\nVigan, the present capital of Ilocos Sur, he constructed a fort, and\r\nleft therein for its protection his lieutenant and twenty-five men,\r\nwhile he himself returned, accompanied only by seventeen soldiers, in\r\nthree small vessels. In this manner he reached the Cagayan River, and\r\nproceeded up it until forced by the great number of hostile natives to\r\nretreat to the sea. Pursuing the voyage to the east coast, he came down\r\nin course of time to Paracale, where he embarked in a boat for Manila,\r\nwas capsized, and rescued from drowning by some passing natives.\r\n\r\n[\"The Cortes of the Philippines.\"] In the meantime Legaspi had died,\r\nand Lavezares was provisionally carrying on the government. Salcedo\r\nheard of this with vexation at being passed over; but, when he\r\nrecovered from his jealousy, he was entrusted with the subjugation of\r\nCamarines, which he accomplished in a short time. In 1574 he returned\r\nto Ilocos, in order to distribute annuities among his soldiers, and to\r\nreceive his own share. While still employed upon the building of Vigan,\r\nhe discovered the fleet of the notorious Chinese pirate, Limahong, who,\r\nbent upon taking possession of the colony, was then passing that part\r\nof the coast with sixty-two ships and a large number of soldiers. He\r\nhastened at once, with all the help which he could summon together in\r\nthe neighborhood, to Manila, where he was nominated to the command of\r\nthe troops, in the place of the already deposed master of the forces;\r\nand he drove the Chinese from the town, which they had destroyed. They\r\nthen withdrew to Pangasinan, and Salcedo burnt their fleet; which\r\nexploit was achieved with very great difficulty. In 1576 this Cortes\r\nof the Philippines died. [261]\r\n\r\n[Commercial importance of early Manila.] Apart from the priests, the\r\nfirst-comers consisted only of officials, soldiers, and sailors; and to\r\nthem, naturally, fell all the high profits of the China trade. Manila\r\nwas their chief market, and it also attracted a great portion of the\r\nexternal Indian trade, which the Portuguese had frightened away from\r\nMalacca by their excessive cruelty. The Portuguese, it is true, still\r\nremained in Macao and the Moluccas: but they wanted those remittances\r\nwhich were almost exclusively sought after by the Chinese, viz.,\r\nthe silver which Manila received from New Spain.\r\n\r\n[Spain and Portugal united.] In 1580 Portugal, together with all\r\nits colonies, was handed over to the Spanish Crown; and the period\r\nextending from this event to the decay of Portugal (1580-1640)\r\nwitnessed the Philippines at the height of their power and prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Manila as capital of a vast empire.] The Governor of Manila ruled\r\nover a part of Mindanao, Sulu, the Moluccas, Formosa, and the original\r\nPortuguese possessions in Malacca and India. \"All that lies between\r\nCape Singapore and Japan is subject to Luzon; their ships cross the\r\nocean to China and New Spain, and drive so magnificent a trade that,\r\nif it were only free, it would be the most extraordinary that the\r\nworld could show. It is incredible what glory these islands confer\r\nupon Spain. The Governor of the Philippines treats with the Kings of\r\nCambodia, Japan, China. The first is his ally, the last his friend;\r\nand the same with Japan. He declares war or peace, without waiting\r\nfor the command from distant Spain.\" [262] [Dutch opposition.] But\r\nthe Dutch had now begun the struggle, which they managed to carry\r\non against Philip II in every corner of the world; and even in 1510\r\nDe Los Rios complained that he found the country very much altered\r\nthrough the progress and advance made by the Dutch; also that the Moros\r\nof Mindanao and Sulu, feeling that they were supported by Holland,\r\nwere continually in a state of discontent.\r\n\r\n[Decline of colony.] The downfall of Portugal occasioned the loss of\r\nher colonies once more. Spanish policy, the government of the priests,\r\nand the jealousy of the Spanish merchants and traders especially,\r\ndid everything that remained to be done to prevent the development\r\nof agriculture and commerce--perhaps, on the whole, fortunately,\r\nfor the natives.\r\n\r\n[Philippine history unimportant and unsatisfactory.] The\r\nsubsequent history of the Philippines is, in all its particulars,\r\nquite as unsatisfactory and uninteresting as that of all the other\r\nSpanish-American possessions. Ineffectual expeditions against pirates,\r\nand continual disputes between the clerical and secular authorities,\r\nform the principal incidents. [263]\r\n\r\n[Undesirable emigrants from Spain.] After the first excitement of\r\nreligious belief and military renown had subsided, the minds of those\r\nwho went later to these outlying possessions, consisting generally as\r\nthey did of the very dregs of the nation, were seized with an intense\r\nfeeling of selfishness; and frauds and speculations were the natural\r\nsequence. The Spanish writers are full of descriptions of the wretched\r\nstate of society then existing, which it is unnecessary to repeat here.\r\n\r\n[English occupation.] The colony had scarcely been molested by\r\nexternal enemies, with the exception of pirates. In the earliest time\r\nthe Dutch had engaged occasionally in attacks on the Bisayas. But\r\nin 1762 (during the war of the Bourbon succession) an English fleet\r\nsuddenly appeared before Manila, and took the surprised town without\r\nany difficulty. The Chinese allied themselves with the English. A\r\ngreat insurrection broke out among the Filipinos, and the colony,\r\nunder the provisional government of a feeble archbishop, was for a\r\ntime in great danger. It was reserved for other dignitaries of the\r\nChurch and Anda, an energetic patriot, to inflame the natives against\r\nthe foreigners; and the opposition incited by the zealousness of the\r\npriests grew to such an extent that the English, who were confined in\r\nthe town, were actually glad to be able to retreat. In the following\r\nyear the news arrived from Europe of the conclusion of peace; but\r\nin the interval this insurrection, brought about by the invasion,\r\nhad rapidly and considerably extended; and it was not suppressed\r\nuntil 1765, when the work was accomplished by creating enmity among\r\nthe different tribes. [264] But this was not done without a loss to\r\nthe province of Ilocos of two hundred sixty-nine thousand two hundred\r\nand seventy persons--half of the population, as represented by Zuñiga.\r\n\r\n[Many minor uprisings from local grievances.] Severity and want of\r\ntact on the part of the Government and their instruments, as well as\r\nbigoted dissensions have caused many revolts of the natives; yet none,\r\nit is true, of any great danger to the Spanish rule. The discontent\r\nhas always been confined to a single district, as the natives do\r\nnot form a united nation; neither the bond of a common speech nor\r\na general interest binding the different tribes together. The state\r\ncommunications and laws among them scarcely reach beyond the borders\r\nof the villages and their dependencies.\r\n\r\n[Danger from mestizos and creoles.] A consideration of far more\r\nimportance to the distant metropolis than the condition of the\r\nconstantly excited natives, who are politically divided among\r\nthemselves, and really have no steady object in view, is the attitude\r\nof the mestizos and creoles, whose discontent increases in proportion\r\nto their numbers and prosperity. The military revolt which broke\r\nout in 1823, the leaders of which were two creoles, might easily\r\nhave terminated fatally for Spain. The latest of all the risings of\r\nthe mestizos seems to have been the most dangerous, not only to the\r\nSpanish power, but to all the European population. [265]\r\n\r\n[Cavite 1872 mutiny.] On the 20th of January, 1872, between eight and\r\nnine in the evening, the artillery, marines, and the garrison of the\r\narsenal revolted in Cavite, the naval base of the Philippines, and\r\nmurdered their officers; and a lieutenant who endeavored to carry the\r\nintelligence to Manila fell into the hands of a crowd of natives. The\r\nnews therefore did not reach the capital until the next morning, when\r\nall the available troops were at once dispatched, and, after a heavy\r\npreliminary struggle, they succeeded the following day in storming\r\nthe citadel. A dreadful slaughter of the rebels ensued. Not a soul\r\nescaped. Among them was not a single European; but there were many\r\nmestizos, of whom several were priests and lawyers. Though perhaps\r\nthe first accounts, written under the influence of terror, may have\r\nexaggerated many particulars, yet both official and private letters\r\nagree in describing the conspiracy as being long contemplated, widely\r\nspread, and well planned. The whole fleet and a large number of troops\r\nwere absent at the time, engaged in the expedition against Sulu. A\r\nportion of the garrison of Manila were to rise at the same time as\r\nthe revolt in Cavite, and thousands of natives were to precipitate\r\nthemselves on the caras blancas (pale faces), and murder them. The\r\nfailure of the conspiracy was, it appears, only attributable to a\r\nfortunate accident--to the circumstance, namely, that a body of the\r\nrebels mistook some rocket fired upon the occasion of a Church festival\r\nfor the agreed signal, and commenced the attack too soon. [266]\r\n\r\n[Summing up.] Let me be permitted, in conclusion, to bring together a\r\nfew observations which have been scattered through the text, touching\r\nthe relations of the Philippines with foreign countries, and briefly\r\nspeculate thereon.\r\n\r\n[Credit due Spain.] Credit is certainly due to Spain for having\r\nbettered the condition of a people who, though comparatively speaking\r\nhighly civilized, yet being continually distracted by petty wars,\r\nhad sunk into a disordered and uncultivated state. The inhabitants of\r\nthese beautiful islands, upon the whole, may well be considered to\r\nhave lived as comfortably during the last hundred years, protected\r\nfrom all external enemies and governed by mild laws, as those of\r\nany other tropical country under native or European sway,--owing,\r\nin some measure, to the frequently discussed peculiar circumstances\r\nwhich protect the interests of the natives.\r\n\r\n[Friars an important factor.] The friars, also, have certainly had\r\nan essential part in the production of the results.\r\n\r\n[Their defects have worked out for good.] Sprung from the lowest\r\norders, inured to hardship and want, and on terms of the closest\r\nintimacy with the natives, they were peculiarly fitted to introduce\r\nthem to a practical conformity with the new religion and code\r\nof morality. Later on, also, when they possessed rich livings,\r\nand their devout and zealous interest in the welfare of the masses\r\nrelaxed in proportion as their incomes increased, they materially\r\nassisted in bringing about the circumstances already described,\r\nwith their favorable and unfavorable aspects. Further, possessing\r\nneither family nor good education, they were disposed to associate\r\nthemselves intimately with the natives and their requirements;\r\nand their arrogant opposition to the temporal power generally arose\r\nthrough their connection with the natives. With the altered condition\r\nof things, however, all this has disappeared. The colony can no\r\nlonger be kept secluded from the world. Every facility afforded for\r\ncommercial intercourse is a blow to the old system, and a great step\r\nmade in the direction of broad and liberal reforms. The more foreign\r\ncapital and foreign ideas and customs are introduced, increasing\r\nthe prosperity, enlightenment, and self-respect of the population,\r\nthe more impatiently will the existing evils be endured.\r\n\r\n[Contrast with English colonies.] England can and does open her\r\npossessions unconcernedly to the world. The British colonies are\r\nunited to the mother country by the bond of mutual advantage,\r\nviz. the production of raw material by means of English capital,\r\nand the exchange of the same for English manufactures. The wealth\r\nof England is so great, the organization of her commerce with the\r\nworld so complete, that nearly all the foreigners even in the British\r\npossessions are for the most part agents for English business houses,\r\nwhich would scarcely be affected, at least to any marked extent,\r\nby a political dismemberment. It is entirely different with Spain,\r\nwhich possesses the colony as an inherited property, and without the\r\npower of turning it to any useful account.\r\n\r\n[Menaces to Spanish rule.] Government monopolies rigorously maintained,\r\ninsolent disregard and neglect of the mestizos and powerful creoles,\r\nand the example of the United States, were the chief reasons of the\r\ndownfall of the American possessions. The same causes threaten ruin\r\nto the Philippines: but of the monopolies I have said enough.\r\n\r\n[Growing American influence.] Mestizos and creoles, it is true, are\r\nnot, as they formerly were in America, excluded from all official\r\nappointments; but they feel deeply hurt and injured through the\r\ncrowds of place-hunters which the frequent changes of ministries\r\nsend to Manila. The influence, also, of the American element is at\r\nleast visible on the horizon, and will be more noticeable when the\r\nrelations increase between the two countries. At present they are\r\nvery slender. The trade in the meantime follows in its old channels to\r\nEngland and to the Atlantic ports of the United States. Nevertheless,\r\nwhoever desires to form an opinion upon the future history of the\r\nPhilippines, must not consider simply their relations to Spain,\r\nbut must have regard to the prodigious changes which a few decades\r\nproduce on either side of our planet.\r\n\r\n[Powerful neighbors] For the first time in the history of the world\r\nthe mighty powers on both sides of the ocean have commenced to enter\r\nupon a direct intercourse with one another--Russia, which alone is\r\nlarger than any two other parts of the earth; China, which contains\r\nwithin its own boundaries a third of the population of the world;\r\nand America, with ground under cultivation nearly sufficient to feed\r\ntreble the total population of the earth. Russia's future role in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean is not to be estimated at present.\r\n\r\n[China and America.] The trade between the two other great powers will\r\ntherefore be presumably all the heavier, as the rectification of the\r\npressing need of human labor on the one side, and of the corresponding\r\noverplus on the other, will fall to them.\r\n\r\n[Nearing predominance of the Pacific.] The world of the ancients was\r\nconfined to the shores of the Mediterranean; and the Atlantic and\r\nIndian Oceans sufficed at one time for our traffic. When first the\r\nshores of the Pacific re-echoed with the sounds of active commerce,\r\nthe trade of the world and the history of the world may be really\r\nsaid to have begun. A start in that direction has been made; whereas\r\nnot so very long ago the immense ocean was one wide waste of waters,\r\ntraversed from both points only once a year. From 1603 to 1769 scarcely\r\na ship had ever visited California, that wonderful country which,\r\ntwenty-five years ago, with the exception of a few places on the coast,\r\nwas an unknown wilderness, but which is now covered with flourishing\r\nand prosperous towns and cities, served by a sea-to-sea railway, and\r\nits capital already ranking the third of the seaports of the Union;\r\neven at this early stage of its existence a central point of the\r\nworld's commerce, and apparently destined, by the proposed junction\r\nof the great oceans, to play a most important part in the future.\r\n\r\n[The mission of America.] In proportion as the navigation of the west\r\ncoast of America extends the influence of the American element over\r\nthe South Sea, the captivating, magic power which the great republic\r\nexercises over the Spanish colonies [267] will not fail to make itself\r\nfelt also in the Philippines, The Americans are evidently destined to\r\nbring to a full development the germs originated by the Spaniards. As\r\nconquerors of modern times, representing the age of free citizens in\r\ncontrast to the age of knighthood, they follow with the plow and the\r\naxe of the pioneer, where the former advanced under the sign of the\r\ncross with their swords.\r\n\r\n[Superiority over Spanish system.] A considerable portion of\r\nSpanish-America already belongs to the United States, and has since\r\nattained an importance which could not possibly have been anticipated\r\neither under the Spanish Government or during the anarchy which\r\nfollowed. With regard to permanence, the Spanish system cannot for a\r\nmoment be compared with that of America. While each of the colonies,\r\nin order to favor a privileged class by immediate gains, exhausted\r\nstill more the already enfeebled population of the metropolis by the\r\nwithdrawal of the best of its ability, America, on the contrary, has\r\nattracted to itself from all countries the most energetic element,\r\nwhich, once on its soil and, freed from all fetters, restlessly\r\nprogressing, has extended its power and influence still further and\r\nfurther. The Philippines will escape the action of the two great\r\nneighboring powers all the less for the fact that neither they nor\r\ntheir metropolis find their condition of a stable and well-balanced\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[Need of Philippine awakening.] It seems to be desirable for the\r\nFilipinos that the above-mentioned views should not speedily become\r\naccomplished facts, because their education and training hitherto\r\nhave not been of a nature to prepare them successfully to compete\r\nwith either of the other two energetic, creative, and progressive\r\nnations. They have, in truth, dreamed away their best days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nState of the Philippines in 1810\r\n\r\nBy Tomas de Comyn\r\n\r\n[Population.] The enumeration of the natives for the assessment\r\nof tributes, in the manner ordained by the standing regulations\r\nof the Intendants of New Spain, is not observed in the Philippine\r\nIslands; nor indeed would this be an easy task. The wide extent of\r\nthe twenty-seven provinces of which they are composed, scattered, as\r\nthey are, through the great space comprehended between the southern\r\npart of Mindanao, and the almost desert islands known by the name of\r\nBatanes and Babuyanes, to the north of that of Luzon, presents almost\r\ninsurmountable obstacles, and in some measure affords an excuse for\r\nthe omission. Among these obstacles may be mentioned the necessity of\r\nwaiting for the favorable monsoon to set in, in order to perform the\r\nseveral voyages from one island to the other; the encumbered state\r\nof the grounds in many parts, the irregular and scattered situations\r\nof the settlements and dwellings, the variety among the natives and\r\ntheir dialects, the imperfect knowledge hitherto obtained of the\r\nrespective limits and extent of many districts, the general want of\r\nguides and auxiliaries, on whom reliance can be placed, and, above all,\r\nthe extreme repugnance the natives evince to the payment of tributes,\r\na circumstance which induces them to resort to all kinds of stratagems,\r\nin order to elude the vigilance of the collectors, and conceal their\r\nreal numbers.\r\n\r\n[Estimates.] The quinquennial census, as regularly enjoined, being\r\nthus found impracticable, no other means are left than to deduce from\r\nthe annual lists, transmitted by the district magistrates to the\r\nsuperintendent's office, and those formed by the parish curates, a\r\nprudent estimate of the total number of inhabitants subject to our laws\r\nand religion; yet these data, although the only ones, and also the most\r\naccurate it is possible to obtain, for this reason, inspire so little\r\nconfidence, that it is necessary to use them with great caution. It is\r\nevident that all the district magistrates and curates do not possess\r\nthe same degree of care and minuteness in a research so important,\r\nand the omission or connivance of their respective delegates, more\r\nor less general, renders it probable that the number of tributes,\r\nnot included in the annual returns, is very considerable. If to\r\nthis we add the leged exemptions from tribute, justly granted to\r\nvarious individuals for a certain number of years, or during the\r\nperformance of special service, we shall easily be convinced of the\r\nimperfection of results, derived from such insecure principles. * * *\r\nI have carefully formed my estimates corresponding to the year 1810,\r\nand by confronting them with such data as I possess relating to the\r\npopulation of 1791, I have deduced the consoling assurance that,\r\nunder a parity of circumstances, the population of these Islands,\r\nfar from having diminished, has, in the interval, greatly increased.\r\n\r\n[Ratio to tributes.] From the collective returns recently made\r\nout by the district magistrates, it would appear that the total\r\nnumber of tributes amounts to 386,654, which multiplied by six and\r\none-half produces the sum of 2,515,406, at which I estimate the\r\ntotal population, including old men, women and children. I ought\r\nhere to observe, that I have chosen this medium of six and one-half\r\nbetween the five persons estimated in Spain and eight in the Indies,\r\nas constituting each family, or entire tribute; for although the\r\nprodigious fecundity of the women in the latter hemisphere, and the\r\nfacility of maintaining their numerous offspring, both the effects\r\nof the benignity of the climate and their sober way of living,\r\nsufficiently warrant the conclusion, that a greater number of persons\r\nenter into the composition of each family, I have, in this case, been\r\ninduced to pay deference to the observations of religious persons,\r\nintrusted with the care of souls, who have assured me that, whether\r\nit be owing to the great mortality prevailing among children, or\r\nthe influence of other local causes, in many districts each family,\r\nor entire tribute, does not exceed four and one-half persons.\r\n\r\n[Foreigners and wild tribes.] To the above amount it is necessary to\r\nadd 7,000 Sangleys (Chinese), who have been enumerated and subjected to\r\ntribute, for, although in the returns preserved in the public offices,\r\nthey are not rated at more than 4,700, there are ample reasons for\r\nconcluding, that many who are wandering about, or hidden in the\r\nprovinces, have eluded the general census. The European Spaniards,\r\nand Spanish creoles and mestizos, do not exceed 4,000 persons, of both\r\nsexes and all ages, and the distinct castes or modifications known in\r\nAmerica under the name of mulattos, quadroons, etc., although found\r\nin the Philippine Islands, are generally confounded in the three\r\nclasses of pure natives, Chinese mestizos, and Chinese. Besides the\r\nabove distinctions, various infidel and independent nations or tribes\r\nexist, more or less savage and ferocious, who have their dwellings in\r\nthe woods and glens, and are distinguished by the respective names of\r\nAetas, Ingolots, Negrillos, Igorots, Tinguianes, etc., nor is there\r\nscarcely a province in Luzon, that does not give shelter to some of\r\nthose isolated tribes, who inhabit and possess many of the mountainous\r\nranges, which ramificate and divide the wide and extended plains of\r\nthat beautiful island.\r\n\r\n[Origin of race.] The original race by which the Philippines are\r\npeopled, is beyond doubt Malayan, and the same that is observed\r\nin Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the other islands of this immense\r\narchipelago. The Philippine Islanders, very different from the\r\nMalabars, whose features possess great regularity, sweetness, and even\r\nbeauty, only resemble the latter in color, although they excel them in\r\nstature, and the good proportion of their limbs. The local population\r\nof the capital, in consequence of its continual communication with\r\nthe Chinese and other Asiatics, with the mariners of various nations,\r\nwith the soldiery and Mexican convicts, who are generally mulattos,\r\nand in considerable numbers sent to the Islands yearly in the way\r\nof transportation, has become a mixture of all kinds of nations and\r\nfeatures, or rather a degeneration from the primitive races.\r\n\r\n[Manila's population.] Manila, the capital of the Philippine Islands,\r\nat present contains a population of from one hundred forty to one\r\nhundred fifty thousand inhabitants, of all classes; but it ought,\r\nhowever, to be understood, that in this computation are included\r\nthe populous suburbs of Santa Cruz, San Fernando, Binondo, Tondo,\r\nQuiapo, San Sebastian, San Anton, and Sampaloc; for although each is\r\nconsidered as a distinct town, having a separate curate, and civil\r\nmagistrate of its own, the subsequent union that has taken place rather\r\nmakes them appear as a prolongation of the city, divided into so many\r\nwards and parishes, in the center of which their respective churches\r\nare built. Among the chief provincial towns, several are found to\r\ncontain a population of from twenty to thirty thousand souls, and\r\nmany not less than ten to twelve thousand. Finally, it is a generally\r\nreceived opinion that, besides the Moros and independent tribes, the\r\ntotal population of the Philippine Islands, subject to the authority\r\nof the king, is equal to three millions.\r\n\r\n[Cotton.] Among the varied productions of the Philippines, for many\r\nreasons, none is so deserving of attention as cotton. Its whiteness\r\nand find staple give to it such a superiority over that of the rest of\r\nAsia, and possibly of the world, that the Chinese anxiously seek it,\r\nin order pereferably to employ it in their most perfect textures,\r\nand purchase it thirty per cent dearer than the best from British\r\nIndia. Notwithstanding this extraordinary allurement, the vicinity\r\nof a good market, and the positive certainty that, however great the\r\nexportation, the growth can never equal the consumption and immense\r\ndemand for this article, it has, nevertheless, hitherto been found\r\nimpossible to extend and improve its cultivation, in such a way as to\r\nrender it a staple commodity of the country. Owing to this lamentable\r\nneglect, is it, that the annual exportation does not exceed five\r\nthousand \"arrobas\" (125,000 lbs.) whereas the British import into\r\nChina at the annual rate of 100,000 bales, or 1,200,000 \"arrobas,\"\r\nproduced in their establishments at Bombay and Calcutta, and which,\r\nsold at the medium price of fifteen \"taels,\" for one hundred thirty\r\npounds, yield the net amount of $4,800,000.\r\n\r\n[Its advantages.] This want of attention to so important a branch\r\nof agriculture is the more to be regretted, as the Islands abound\r\nin situations peculiarly adapted for the cultivation of cotton, and\r\nthe accidental failure of the crops in some provinces, might easily\r\nbe made up by their success in others. The culture of this plant is\r\nbesides extremely easy, as it requires no other labor than clearing\r\nthe grounds from brush-wood, and lightly turning up the earth with a\r\nplough, before the seeds are scattered, which being done, the planter\r\nleaves the crop to its own chance, and in five months gathers abundant\r\nfruit, if, at the time the bud opens, it is not burnt by the north\r\nwinds, or rotted with unseasonable showers.\r\n\r\n[Restricted cultivation.] The provinces of Ilocos and Batangas\r\nare the only ones in which the cultivation of cotton is pursued\r\nwith any degree of zeal and care, and it greatly tends to enrich\r\nthe inhabitants. This successful example has not, however, hitherto\r\nexcited emulation in those of the other provinces; and thus the only\r\nproduction of the Philippine Islands, of which the excellence and\r\nsuperior demand in trade are as well known as its culture is easy,\r\nowing to strange fatality and causes which will be hereafter noticed,\r\nis left almost in a neglected state, or, at most, confined to the\r\nnarrow limits of local consumption.\r\n\r\n[Indigo.] Pangasinan, Pampanga, Bataan, La Laguna, Tayabas and\r\nCamarines produce indigo of various classes, and, although its\r\npreparation or the extraction of the dye, is in most of the above\r\nprovinces still performed in an equally imperfect manner, several\r\nsmall improvements have recently been made, which have bettered the\r\nquality, more particularly in La Laguna, the only district in which\r\nattempts have been made to imitate the process used in Guatemala,\r\nas well with regard to the construction and number of vats necessary,\r\nas the precipitation of the coloring particles--detached from the plant\r\nby the agitation of the water. In the other places, the whole of the\r\noperations are performed in a single vat, and the indigo obtained is\r\nnot unfrequently impregnated with lime and other extraneous substances.\r\n\r\n[Increasing culture.] Whatever may have been the causes of this evident\r\nbackwardness, from the period of the establishment of the Philippine\r\nCompany in these Islands, and in consequence of the exertions of some\r\nof the directors to promote the cultivation of indigo, at that time\r\nvery little known, the natives have slowly, though gradually, been\r\nreconciled to it; and discovering it to be one of the most advantageous\r\nbranches of industry, although accompanied with some labor and exposed\r\nto the influence of droughts and excessive heats, as well as to the\r\nrisks attendant on the extraordinary anticipation of the rainy seasons,\r\nhave of late years paid more attention to it. The quintal of indigo\r\nof the first class costs the planter from $35 to $40 at most; and in\r\nthe market of Manila it has been sold from $60 to $130, according to\r\nthe quality and the greater or lesser demand for the article at the\r\nseason. As, however, everything in this colony moves within a small\r\ncircle, it is not possible to obtain large quantities for exportation;\r\nnot only because of the risk in advancing the Indian sums of money\r\non account of his crop, but also owing to the annual surplus seldom\r\nexceeding from two to two thousand five hundred distributed in many\r\nhands, and collected by numerous agents, equally interested in making\r\nup their return-cargoes.\r\n\r\n[Sugar.] The cultivation of the sugar-cane is more or less extended\r\nto all the provinces of these Islands, owing to its consumption among\r\nthe natives being both great and general; but those of La Pampanga and\r\nPangasinan are more particularly devoted to it. These two provinces\r\nalone annually produce about 550,000 arrobas (13,750,000 lbs.) of\r\nwhich one-third is usually exported in Chinese and other foreign\r\nvessels. In extraordinary seasons, the amount exported greatly\r\nexceeds the quantity above stated, as, for example, happened in the\r\nmonsoon of 1796, when the planters came down to the port of Manila,\r\nand by contract exported upwards of nine millions weight, of the first\r\nand second qualities. The price of this article has experienced many\r\nvariations of late years; but the medium may be estimated at $6 for one\r\nhundred twenty-five pounds of the first quality, and $5 for the second.\r\n\r\n[Method of Manufacture.] The superior quality of the sugar of\r\nthe Philippines is acknowledged, when compared to that produced\r\nin the Island of Java, China, or Bengal; notwithstanding in the\r\nlatter countries it may naturally be concluded that greater pains\r\nand care are bestowed on its manufacture. The pressure of the cane\r\nin the Philippine Islands is performed by means of two coarse stone\r\ncylinders, placed on the ground, and moved in opposite directions by\r\nthe slow and unequal pace of a \"carabao,\" a species of ox or buffalo,\r\npeculiar to this and other Asiatic countries. The juice is conveyed to\r\nan iron caldron, and in this the other operations of boiling, skimming\r\nand cleansing take place, till the crystallization or adhering of\r\nthe sugar is completed. All these distinct parts of the process, in\r\nother colonies, are performed in four separate vessels, confided to\r\ndifferent hands, and consequently experience a much greater degree of\r\ncare and dexterity. After being properly clayed, the sugars acquire\r\nsuch a state of consistency that, when shipped in canvas bags, they\r\nbecome almost petrified in the course of the voyage, without moistening\r\nor purging, as I understand is the case with those of Bengal.\r\n\r\n[Silk.] Among the useful objects to which the Patriotic Society of\r\nManila (Amigos del Pais) directed their attention, from the very\r\nmoment of their formation, the planting of mulberry trees seems to\r\nhave met with peculiar encouragement. The society rightly judged that\r\nthe naturalization of so valuable a commodity as silk in these Islands\r\nwould materially increase the resources of the colony, and there was\r\nreason to hope that, besides local consumption, the growth might in\r\ntime be so much extended as to supply the wants of New Spain, which\r\nare not less than 80,000 lbs., amounting to from $350,000 to $400,000,\r\nconveyed there in the galleon annually sent to the port of Acapulco,\r\nby the Manila merchants, which article they are now compelled to\r\ncontract for in China.\r\n\r\n[Mulberry trees.] The Society gave the first impulse to this laudable\r\nproject, and then the governor of the Islands, Don José Basco, anxious\r\nto realize it, with this view sent Colonel Charles Conely on a special\r\ncommission to the province of Camarines. This zealous officer and\r\ndistrict magistrate, in the years 1786-1788 caused 4,485,782 mulberry\r\ntrees to be planted in the thirty districts under his jurisdiction;\r\nand incalculable are the happy results which would have attended a\r\nplan so extensive, and commenced with so much vigor, if it could have\r\nbeen continued with the same zeal by his successor, and not at once\r\ndestroyed, through a mistaken notion of humanity, with which, soon\r\nafter the departure of Governor Basco, they proceeded to exonerate\r\nthe Filipinos from all agricultural labor that was not free and\r\nspontaneous, in conformity, as was then alleged, to the general spirit\r\nof our Indian legislation. As it was natural to expect, the total\r\nabandonment of this valuable branch followed a measure so fatal, and\r\nnotwithstanding the efforts subsequently made by the Royal Company, in\r\norder to obtain its restoration, as well in Camarines as the Province\r\nof Tondo, all their exertions were in vain, though it must be allowed\r\nthat at the time several untoward circumstances contributed to thwart\r\ntheir anxious wishes. Notwithstanding this failure, the project, far\r\nfrom being deemed impracticable, would beyond all doubt succeed, and,\r\nunder powerful patronage, completely answer the well-founded hopes of\r\nits original conceivers and promoters. The natives themselves would\r\nsoon be convinced of the advantages to be derived from the possession\r\nof an article, in so many ways applicable to their own fine textures,\r\nand besides the variety of districts in the Islands, proved to be\r\nsuitable to the cultivation of this interesting tree, it is a known\r\nfact that many of the old mulberry groves are still in existence.\r\n\r\n[Beeswax.] The Bisayas, Cagayan, and many other provinces, produce wax\r\nin considerable abundance, which the Indians collect from the natural\r\nhives formed in the cavities of the trees, and it is also brought down\r\nby the infidel natives from the mountains to the neighboring towns. The\r\nquality certainly is not the best, and notwithstanding attempts have\r\nbeen made to cleanse it from the extraneous particles with which it\r\nis mixed, it always leaves a considerable sediment on the lower part\r\nof the cakes, and never acquires an entire whiteness. Its consumption\r\nis great, especially in the capital, and after supplying the wants of\r\nthe country, an annual surplus of from six hundred to eight hundred\r\nquintals is appropriated for exportation.\r\n\r\n[Neglected market.] This certainly might be converted into an article\r\nof extreme importance, especially for the kingdom of Peru, which\r\nin peaceable times receives its supplies from Spain, and even from\r\nthe Island of Cuba; but for this purpose it would be necessary to\r\nadopt the plan recommended by the enlightened zeal of the Patriotic\r\nSociety and previously encourage the establishment of artificial\r\nhives and the plantation of aromatic and flowering shrubs, which so\r\neasily attract and secure the permanency of the roving swarms, always\r\nready to undertake fresh labors. This, as well as many other points,\r\nhas hitherto been entirely overlooked.\r\n\r\n[Black pepper.] The production is cultivated in the Provinces of\r\nTayabas, Batangas, and La Laguna, but in such small quantities, that,\r\nnotwithstanding the powerful allurements of all kinds constantly held\r\nout by the Royal Company during the long period of twenty years,\r\ntheir agents have never been able to collect in more than about\r\n64,000 lbs. annually. After every encouragement, the most that\r\nhas been attained with the natives, is confined to their planting\r\nin some districts fifty to one hundred pepper-vines round their\r\nhuts, which they cultivate in the same way as they would plots of\r\nflowers, but without any other labor than supporting the plant with\r\na proportioned stake, clearing the ground from weeds, and attending\r\nto daily irrigation.\r\n\r\n[A possibility.] This article therefore scarcely deserves a place\r\namongst the flourishing branches of agriculture, at least till it has\r\nbeen raised from its present depressed state, and the grounds laid\r\nout in regular and productive pepper-groves. Till this is done, to\r\na corresponding extent, it must also be excluded from the number of\r\nproductions furnished by these Islands to commerce and exportation;\r\nmore particularly if we consider that, notwithstanding the great\r\nfragrance of the grain, as well as its general superiority over the\r\nrest of Asia, so great a difference exists in the actual price, that\r\nthis can never be compensated by its greater request in the markets of\r\nEurope, and much less enable it to compete with that of the British and\r\nDutch, till its abundance has considerably lowered its primitive value.\r\n\r\n[Not popular.] Finally, although an infinity of grounds are to be found\r\nadapted to the rapid propagation of pepper-vines, as may easily be\r\ninferred from the analogy and proximity of the Philippine Islands to\r\nthe others of this same archipelago, so well known for their growth\r\nof spices, it must be confessed that it is a species of culture by\r\nno means popular among the Philippine natives, and it would be almost\r\nrequiring too much from their inconstancy of character, to wish them\r\nto dedicate their lands and time to the raising of a production which,\r\nbesides demanding considerable care, is greatly exposed to injury,\r\nand even liable to be destroyed by the severity of the storms, which\r\nfrequently mark the seasons. With difficulty would they be induced to\r\nwait five years before they were able to gather the uncertain fruits\r\nof their labor and patience. If, therefore, it should ever be deemed\r\na measure of policy to encourage the growth of black pepper, it will\r\nbe necessary for the government to order the commons belonging to each\r\ntown, and adapted to this species of plantation, to be appropriated to\r\nthis use, by imposing on the inhabitants the obligation of taking care\r\nof them, and drawing from the respective coffers of each community the\r\nnecessary funds for the payment of the laborers, and the other expenses\r\nof cultivation. If this cannot be done, it will be necessary to wait\r\ntill the general condition of the country is improved, when through\r\nthe spirit of emulation, and the enterprises of the planters being duly\r\npatronized and supported, present difficulties may be overcome, and the\r\nprogressive results of future attempts will be then found to combine\r\nthe interests of individuals with the general welfare of the colony.\r\n\r\n[Coffee.] So choice is the quality of the coffee produced in the\r\nIsland of Luzon, especially in the districts of Indang and Silang,\r\nin the province of Cavite, that if it is not equal to that of Mocha,\r\nI at least consider it on parallel with the coffee of Bourbon; but,\r\nas the consumption and cultivation are extremely limited, it cannot\r\nwith any propriety be yet numbered among the articles contributing\r\nto the export-trade.\r\n\r\n[Cocoa.] Cocoa is something more attended to, in consequence of the\r\nuse of chocolate being greatly extended among the natives of easy\r\ncircumstances. That of the Island of Cebu, is esteemed superior to\r\nthe cocoa of Guayaquil, and possibly it is not excelled by that of\r\nSoconusco. As, however, the quantity raised does not suffice for\r\nthe local consumption, Guayaquil cocoa meets a ready sale, and is\r\ngenerally brought in return-cargo by the ships coming from Acapulco,\r\nand those belonging to the Philippine company dispatched from Callao,\r\nthe shipping port of Lima.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of these two articles in the Philippines is on the\r\nsame footing as that of pepper, which, as above stated, is rather an\r\nobject of luxury and recreation than one of speculation among the\r\nFilipinos. The observations and rules pointed out in the preceding\r\narticle, are, in a general sense, applicable to both these branches\r\nof industry.\r\n\r\n[Cinnamon.] Cinnamon groves, or trees of wild cinnamon, are to be\r\nfound in every province. In Mindanao, a Dutchman, some years ago,\r\nwas employed by orders of the government, in examining the forests\r\nand making experiments, with a view to discover the same tree of\r\nthis species that has given so much renown to Ceylon; but, whether\r\nit was owing to a failure in the discovery, or, when the plant was\r\nfound, as at the time was said to be the case, the same results were\r\nnot produced, from the want of skill in preparing, or stripping off\r\nthe bark; certain it is, that the laudable attempt totally failed,\r\nor rather the only advantage gained, has been the extracting from\r\nthe bark and more tender parts of the branches of the tree, an oil\r\nor essence of cinnamon, vigorous and aromatic in the extreme.\r\n\r\n[Experiment in Laguna.] About the same time, a land-owner of the name\r\nSalgado, undertook to form an extensive plantation of the same species\r\nin the province of La Laguna, and succeeded in seeing upwards of a\r\nmillion cinnamon trees thrive and grow to a considerable size; but\r\nat last, he was reluctantly compelled to desist from his enterprise,\r\nby the same reasons which led to the failure of Mindanao.\r\n\r\n[Need of experienced cultivators.] These facts are of sufficient\r\nauthority for our placing the cinnamon tree among the indigenous\r\nproductions of the Philippine Islands and considering their general\r\nexcellence above those of the same nature in the rest of Asia, it may\r\nreasonably be concluded that, without the tree being identically the\r\nsame, the cinnamon with which it is clothed will be found finer than\r\nthat yielded by the native plant of the Island of Ceylon, and this\r\ncircumstance, consequently, holds out a hope that, in the course of\r\ntime, it may become an article of traffic, as estimable as it would be\r\nnew. In order, however, that this flattering prospect may be realized,\r\nit will be requisite for the government to procure some families,\r\nor persons from the above island, acquainted with the process of\r\nstripping off the bark and preparing the cinnamon, by dexterously\r\noffering allurements, corresponding to the importance of the service,\r\nwhich, although in itself it may probably be an extremely simple\r\noperation, as long as it is unknown, will be an insuperable obstacle\r\nto the propagation of so important an agricultural pursuit.\r\n\r\n[Nutmeg.] Two species of nutmeg are known here, the one in shape\r\nresembling a pigeon's egg, and the other of a perfectly spherical\r\nform; but both are wild and little aromatic, and consequently held\r\nin no great esteem.\r\n\r\n[Rice.] Rice is the bread and principal aliment of these natives, for\r\nwhich reason, although its cultivation is among the most disagreeable\r\ndepartments of husbandry, they devote themselves to it with astonishing\r\nconstancy and alacrity, so as to form a complete contrast with their\r\ncharacteristic indifference in most other respects. This must, however,\r\nbe taken as a certain indication of the possibility of training them\r\nup to useful labor; whenever they can be led on in a proper manner.\r\n\r\n[High yield.] The earth corresponds with surprising fertility to\r\nthe labors of the Filipino, rewarding him, in the good seasons, with\r\nninety, and even as high as one hundred per cent; a fact I have fully\r\nascertained and of which I besides possess undoubted proofs, obtained\r\nfrom the parish-curates of La Pampanga. As, however, the provinces are\r\nfrequently visited with dreadful hurricanes (called in the country,\r\nbaguios), desolated by locusts, and exposed to the effects of the\r\ngreat irregularities of nature, which, in these climes, often acts\r\nin extreme, the crops of this grain are precarious, or at least,\r\nno reliance can be placed on a certain surplus allowing an annual\r\nexportation to China. On this account, rice cannot be placed in the\r\nlist of those articles which give support to the external trade.\r\n\r\n[Dye and cabinet woods.] The \"sibucao,\" or logwood, and ebony, in\r\nboth which these islands abound, are the only woods in any tolerable\r\nrequest. The first is sold with advantage in Bengal, and the other\r\nmeets a ready sale in the ports of China, in the absence of that\r\nbrought from the Island of Bourbon, which is a quality infinitely\r\nsuperior. Both are however, articles of no great consumption, for,\r\nbeing bulky and possessing little intrinsic value, they will not\r\nbear the high charges of freight and other expenses, attendant on\r\nthe navigation of the Asiatic seas, and can only suit the shipper,\r\nas cargo, who is anxious not to return to the above countries in\r\nballast. Hence, as an object of export trade, these articles cannot\r\nbe estimated at more than $30,000 per annum.\r\n\r\n[Timber.] I deem it superfluous to dwell on a multitude of other\r\ngood and even precious woods in timber, with which the Philippine\r\nIslands are gifted, because this is a subject already sufficiently well\r\nunderstood, and a complete collection of specimens, as well as some\r\nlarge blocks, were besides transmitted some years ago to the king's\r\ndockyard. It may, however, be proper to remark, that the establishment\r\nnear the capital for shipbuilding and masts, are much more expensive\r\nthan is generally supposed, as well on account of the difficulties\r\nexperienced in dragging the trees from the interior of the mountains\r\nto the water's edge, as the want of regularity and foresight with\r\nwhich these operations have been usually conducted. Besides these\r\nreasons, as it is necessary that the other materials requisite for\r\nthe construction and complete armament of vessels of a certain\r\nforce, should come from Europe, it is neither easy, nor indeed,\r\nwould it be economical, as was erroneously asserted, to carry into\r\neffect the government project of annually building, in the colony,\r\na ship of the line and a frigate. It ought further to be observed,\r\nthat no stock of timber, cut at a proper season and well cured, has\r\nbeen lain in, and although the wages of the native carpenters and\r\ncaulkers are moderate, no comparison whatever can be made between the\r\ndaily work they perform, and that which is done in the same space of\r\ntime in our dock-yards of Spain.\r\n\r\n[Ship building advantages.] Notwithstanding, however, the impediments\r\nabove stated, as it is undeniable that abundance of suitable timber is\r\nto be obtained, and as the conveyance of the remainder of the necessary\r\nnaval stores to the Philippine Islands is shorter and more economical\r\nthan to the coast of California, it possibly might answer, at least,\r\nmany mariners are of this opinion, in case it is deemed expedient to\r\ncontinue building at San Blas the brigs and corvettes necessary for the\r\nprotection of the military posts and missions, situated along the above\r\ncoasts, to order them preferably to be built in Cavite giving timely\r\nadvice, and previously taking care to make the necessary arrangements.\r\n\r\n[Gold.] Gold abounds in Luzon and in many of the other islands; but as\r\nthe mountains which conceal it are in possession of the pagan tribes,\r\nthe mines are not worked; indeed it may be said they are scarcely\r\nknown. These mountaineers collect it in the brooks and streamlets,\r\nand in the form of dust, offer it to the Christians who inhabit the\r\nneighboring plains, in exchange for coarse goods and fire-arms; and it\r\nhas sometimes happened that they have brought it down in grains of one\r\nand two ounces weight. The natives of the province of Camarines partly\r\ndevote themselves to the working of the mines of Mambulao and Paracale,\r\nwhich have the reputation of being very rich; but, far from availing\r\nthemselves in the smallest degree of the advantages of art, they\r\ncontent themselves with extracting the ore by means of an extremley\r\nimperfect fusion, which is done by placing the mineral in shells and\r\nthen heating them on embers. A considerable waste consequently takes\r\nplace, and although the metal obtained is good and high colored,\r\nit generally, passes into the hands of the district-magistrate, who\r\ncollects it at a price infinitely lower than it is worth in trade. It\r\nis a generally received opinion that gold mines are equally to be\r\nmet with in the Province of Caraga, situated on the coasts of the\r\ngreat Island of Mindanao, where, as well as in other points, this\r\nmetal is met with equal to twenty-two karats. The quantity, however,\r\nhitherto brought down from the mountains by the pagan tribes, and\r\nthat obtained by the tributary Filipinos, has not been an object of\r\nvery great importance.\r\n\r\n[Copper.] Well-founded reasons exist for presuming that, in\r\nthe Province of Ilocos, mines of virgin copper exist, a singular\r\nproduction of nature, or at least, not very common, if the generality\r\nof combinations under which this metal presents itself in the\r\nrest of the globe, are duly considered. This is partly inferred\r\nfrom the circumstance of its having been noticed that the Igorots,\r\nwho occasionally come down from the mountains to barter with the\r\nChristians, use certain coarse jars or vessels of copper, evidently\r\nmade by themselves with the use of a hammer, without any art or\r\nregularity; and as the ignorance of these demi-savages is too great\r\nfor them to possess the notions necessary for the separation of the\r\ncomponent parts which enter into the combination of minerals, and much\r\nless for the construction of furnaces suitable to the smelting and\r\nformation of the moulds, it is concluded they must have found some\r\nvein of copper entirely pure, which, without the necessity of any\r\nother preparation, they have been able to flatten with the hammer and\r\nrendered maleable, so as to convert it into the rough vessels above\r\nspoken of.\r\n\r\n[Cinnabar.] The district-magistrate of Caraga, Don Augustin de Ioldi,\r\nreceived a special commission from the government to explore and\r\nobtain information respecting a mine of cinnabar, which was said\r\nto be situated under his jurisdiction; and I have been informed of\r\nanother of the same species in the Island of Samar, the working of\r\nwhich has ceased for a considerable time, not because the prospect was\r\nunfavorable, but for the want of an intelligent person to superintend\r\nand carry on the operations. The utility of such a discovery is too\r\nobvious not to deserve, on the part of government, the most serious\r\nattention and every encouragement to render it available; and it is\r\nto be hoped that, as the first steps have already been taken in this\r\nimportant disclosure, the enterprise will not be abandoned, but, on\r\nthe contrary, that exertions will be made to obtain aid and advice\r\nfrom the Miners' College of Mexico, as the best means of removing\r\ndoubt, and acting with judgment in the affair.\r\n\r\n[Iron.] Iron in mineral form is to be found at various points on Luzon,\r\nand those engaged in working it, without the necessity of digging;\r\ncollect the iron-bearing stones that constitute the upper stratum,\r\nthese, when placed in fusion, generally yield about forty per cent\r\nclear metal. This is the case in the mountains of Angat, situated\r\nin the Province of Bulacan, and also in the vicinity of the Baliwag\r\nRiver. In Morong, however, belonging to the Province of La Laguna,\r\nwhere the cannon-ball factory is established, the ore yields under\r\ntwenty-two per cent. Its quality is in general better than the Biscayan\r\niron, according to formal experiments and a report, made in 1798 to\r\nGovernor Don Rafael Maria de Aguilar, by two Biscayan master-smiths\r\nfrom the squadron of Admiral Alava. Witnesses to this test were the\r\nCount de Aviles and Don Felix de la Rosa, proprietors of the mines of\r\nMorong and Angat, and the factor of the Philippine Company, Don Juan\r\nFrancisco Urroroz. Notwithstanding its advantages, this interesting\r\nbranch of industry has not yet passed beyond the most rude principles\r\nand imperfect practice, owing to the want of correct information\r\nas to the best process, and scarcity of funds on the part of the\r\nproprietors to carry on their works. Without the aid of rolling or\r\nslitting mills, indeed unprovided with the most essential instruments,\r\nthey have hitherto confined themselves to converting their iron into\r\nplow shares, bolos, hoes, and such other agricultural implements;\r\nleaving the Chinese of Amoy in quiet possession of the advantages\r\nof being allowed to market annual supplies of all kinds of nails,\r\nthe boilers used on the sugar plantations, pots and pans, as well as\r\nother articles in this line, which might easily be manufactured in\r\nthe Islands.\r\n\r\n[Sulphur.] In the Island of Leyte, abundance of sulphur is met with,\r\nand from thence the gunpowder works of Manila are supplied at very\r\nreasonable prices. Jaspers, cornelians and agates, are also found in\r\nprofusion in many of these provinces; everything, indeed, promises\r\nvaried mineral wealth worthy of exciting the curiosity and useful\r\nresearches of mineralogists, who, unfortunately, have not hitherto\r\nextended their labors to these remote parts of the globe.\r\n\r\n[Pearls.] Pearl fisheries are, from time to time, undertaken off the\r\ncoast of the Island of Mindanao, and also near smaller islands not\r\nfar from Cebu, but with little success and less constancy, not because\r\nthere is a scarcity of fine pearls of a bright color and considerable\r\nsize, but on account of the divers' want of skill and their just dread\r\nof the sharks, which, in great numbers infest these seas. Amber is\r\nfrequently gathered in considerable lumps in the vicinity of Samar and\r\nthe other Visayan Islands as well as mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell,\r\nand red and black coral, of the latter kind of which, I have seen\r\nshafts as thick as my finger and six or eight feet long.\r\n\r\n[Estates.] The proprietors of estates in the Philippines are of\r\nfour classes. The most considerable is that of the religious orders,\r\nAugustinians and Dominicans, who cultivate their respective lands on\r\njoint account, or let them out at a moderate ground-rent, which the\r\nplanters pay in kind; but far from living in opulence, and accumulating\r\nthe immense revenues some of the religious communities enjoy in\r\nAmerica, they stand in need of all they earn and possess for their\r\nmaintenance, and in order to be enabled to discharge the various duties\r\nand obligations annexed to the missions with which they are entrusted.\r\n\r\n[Spanish planters.] The second class comprehends the Spanish\r\nproprietors, whose number possibly does not exceed a dozen of persons,\r\nand even they labor under such disadvantages, and have to contend with\r\nso many obstacles, under the existing order of things, that, compelled\r\nto divide their lands into rice plantations, in consequence of this\r\nbeing the species of culture to which the natives are most inclined,\r\nand to devote a considerable portion of them to the grazing of horned\r\ncattle, no one of them is in a situation to give to agriculture the\r\nvariety and extent desired, or to attain any progress in a pursuit\r\nwhich in other colonies rapidly leads to riches.\r\n\r\n[Filipino farmers.] The third consists of the principal mestizos\r\nand natives, and is in fact that which constitutes the real body of\r\nfarming proprietors. In the fourth and last may be included all the\r\nother natives, who generally possess a small strip of land situated\r\nround their dwellings, or at the extremities of the various towns\r\nand settlements formed by the conquerors; besides what they may\r\nhave obtained from their ancestors in the way of legal inheritance,\r\nwhich rights have been confirmed to them by the present sovereign of\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\n[Aids to agriculture.] It will beyond doubt, in some measure dissipate\r\nthe distrust by which the Filipino is actuated, when the new and\r\npaternal exertions of the superior government, to ameliorate his\r\npresent situation, are fully known, and when that valuable portion of\r\nour distant population is assured that their rights will henceforth be\r\nrespected, and those exactions and compulsory levies which formerly\r\nso much disheartened them, are totally abolished. On the other\r\nhand, a new stimulus will be given by the living example and fresh\r\nimpulse communicated to the provinces by other families emigrating\r\nand settling there, nurtured in the spirit and principles of those\r\nreforms in the ideas and maxims of government by which the present\r\nera is distinguished. A practical participation in these advantages\r\nwill, most assuredly, awaken a spirit of enterprise and emulation\r\nthat may be extremely beneficial to agriculture, and as the wants\r\nof the natives increase in proportion as they are enabled to know\r\nand compare the comforts arising out of the presence and extension\r\nof conveniences and luxuries in their own towns, they will naturally\r\nbe led to possess and adopt them.\r\n\r\n[Plans for progress.] So salutary a change, however, can only be\r\nthe work of time, and as long as the government confines itself\r\nto a system merely protecting, the effects must consequently be\r\nslow. As it is therefore necessary to put in action more powerful\r\nsprings than the ordinary ones, it will be found expedient partly to\r\nrelax from some of those general principles which apply to societies,\r\ndifferently constituted, or rather formed of other perfectly distinct\r\nelements. As relating to the subject under discussion, I fortunately\r\ndiscover two means, pointed out in the laws themselves, essentially\r\njust, and at the same time capable of producing in this populous\r\ncolony, more than in any other, the desired results. The legislator,\r\nfounding himself on the common obligation of the subject to contribute\r\nsomething in return for the protection he receives, and to co-operate\r\nin the increase of the power and opulence of the State, proscribes\r\nidleness as a crime, and points out labor as a duty; and although\r\nthe regulations touching the natives breathe the spirit of humanity,\r\nand exhibit the wisdom with which they were originally formed, they\r\nnevertheless concur and are directed to this primary object. In them\r\nthe distribution of vacant lands, as well as of the natives at fair\r\ndaily wages to clear them, is universally allowed, and these it seems\r\nto me, are the means from an equitable and intelligent application\r\nof which the most beneficial consequences may be expected.\r\n\r\n[Confiscating unused lands.] The first cannot be attended with any\r\ngreat difficulty, because all the provinces abound in waste and vacant\r\nlands, and scarcely is there a district in which some are not to be\r\nfound of private property completely uncultivated and neglected,\r\nand consequently susceptible, as above stated, of being legally\r\ntransferred, for this reason alone, to the possession of an active\r\nowner. Let their nature however, be what it may, in their adjudication,\r\nit is of the greatest importance to proceed with uniformity, by\r\nconsecrating, in a most irrevocable manner, the solemnity of all\r\nsimilar grants. Public interest and reason, in the Philippine Islands,\r\nrequire that in all such cases deference only should be paid to\r\ndemands justly interposed, and formally established within a due and\r\nfixed period; but after full and public notice has been given by the\r\nrespective judicial authorities, of the titles about to be granted,\r\nthe counter claims the natives may seek to put in after the lapse of\r\nthe period prefixed, should be peremptorily disregarded. Although at\r\nfirst sight this appears a direct infringement on the imprescriptible\r\nrights of property, it must be considered that in some cases individual\r\ninterests ought to be sacrificed to the general good, and that the\r\nbalance used, when treating of the affairs of State, is never of\r\nthat rigid kind as if applied to those of minor consideration. The\r\nfact is, that by this means many would be induced to form estates,\r\nwho have hitherto been withheld by the dread of involving themselves,\r\nand spending their money in law suits; at the same time the natives,\r\ngradually accustoming themselves to this new order of things, would\r\nlay aside that disposition to strife and contention, which forms so\r\npeculiar a trait in their character, and that antipathy and odium would\r\nalso disappear with which they have usually viewed the agricultural\r\nundertakings of Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[Compulsory labor.] Proceeding to the consideration of the second\r\nmeans of accelerating the improvement of agriculture, viz., the\r\ndistribution of the natives, it will suffice to say that it would be\r\nequally easy to show that it is absolutely necessary rigorously to\r\ncarry into effect, in the Philippine Islands, whatever the laws on this\r\nsubject prescribed, otherwise we must give up all those substantial\r\nhopes entertained of the felicity of the colony. We are no longer in\r\na situation to be restricted to the removal of ordinary obstacles,\r\nand the season is gone by in which, as heretofore, it entered into\r\nour policy to employ no other than indirect stimulants--in order to\r\nincline the Filipino to labor. It is evident that admonitions and\r\noffers of reward no longer suffice; nor indeed have the advantageous\r\nterms proposed to them by some planters, with a view to withdraw\r\nthe lower orders of the natives, such as the timauas and caglianes\r\nplebeians, from the idle indifference in which they are sunk, been of\r\nany avail. Their wants and wishes being easily supplied, the whole\r\nof their happiness seems to depend on quiet and repose, and their\r\nhighest enjoyment on the pleasure of sleep. Energy, however, and a\r\ncertain degree of severity must be employed, if permanent resources\r\nare to be called forth, and if the progressive settlement of European\r\nfamilies and the formation of estates proportioned to the fertility\r\nof the soil and capabilities of the country are to enter into the\r\nviews of government. In vain would grants and transfers of vacant and\r\nuseless lands be made to new and enterprising proprietors, unless at\r\nthe same time they can be provided with laborers, and experience every\r\nother possible facility, in order to clear, enclose, and cultivate\r\nthem. Hence follows the indispensable necessity of appealing to the\r\nsystem of distributions, as above pointed out; for what class of\r\nlaborers can be obtained in a country where the whites are so few,\r\nunless it be the natives? Should they object to personal service,\r\nshould they refuse to labor for an equitable and daily allowance,\r\nby which means they would also cease to be burdens to the State\r\nand to society, are they not to be compelled to contribute by this\r\nmeans to the prosperity of which they are members; in a word, to\r\nthe public good, and thus make some provision for old age? If the\r\nsoldier, conveyed away from his native land, submits to dangers, and\r\nis unceasingly exposed to death in defence of the State, why should\r\nnot the Filipino moderately use his strength and activity in tilling\r\nthe fields which are to sustain him and enrich the commonwealth?\r\n\r\n[The undeveloped Philippines.] Besides, things in the Philippine\r\nIslands wear a very different aspect to what they do on the American\r\ncontinent, where, as authorized by the said laws, a certain number\r\nof natives may be impressed for a season, and sent off inland to a\r\nconsiderable distance from their dwellings, either for the purpose of\r\nagriculture, or working the mines, provided only they are taken care of\r\nduring their journeys, maintained, and the price of their daily labor,\r\nas fixed by the civil authorities, regularly paid to them. The immense\r\nvalleys and mountains susceptible of cultivation, especially in the\r\nIsland of Luzon, being once settled, and the facilities of obtaining\r\nhands increased, such legal acts of compulsion, far from being any\r\nlonger necessary, will have introduced a spirit of industry that\r\nwill render the labors of the field supportable and even desirable;\r\nand in this occupation all the tributary natives of the surrounding\r\nsettlements can be alternately employed, by the day or week, and thus\r\ndo their work almost at the door of their own huts, and as it were\r\nin sight of their wives and children.\r\n\r\n[No legal obstacle to forced labor.] If, after what has been above\r\nstated, the apparent opposition obstacle to which at first sight\r\nstrikes the eye, in Law 40, Title 12, Book 6, speaking on this subject,\r\nand expressly referring to the Philippine Islands, should be alleged,\r\nno more will be necessary than to study its genuine sense, or read it\r\nwith attention, in order to be convinced of its perfect concordance\r\nwith the essential parts of the other laws of the Indies, already\r\nquoted in explanation and support of the system of distributing\r\nthe laborers. The above-mentioned law does indeed contain a strict\r\nrecommendation to employ the Chinese and Japanese, not domiciliated,\r\nin preference to the natives, in the establishments for cutting timber\r\nand other royal works, and further enjoins that use is only to be made\r\nin emergencies, and when the preservation of the state should require\r\nit. It has, however, happened that, since the remote period at which\r\nthe above was promulgated, not only all contracts and commerce have\r\nceased, but also every communication with Japan has been interrupted,\r\nand for a number of years not a single individual of that ferocious\r\nrace has existed in the Philippine Islands. With regard to the Chinese,\r\nwho are supposed to be numerous in the capital, of late years they have\r\ndiminished so much, that according to a census made by orders of the\r\ngovernment in the year 1807, no more than four thousand seven hundred\r\nare found on the registers; and, if in consequence of their secreting\r\nthemselves, or withdrawing into the interior, a third more might be\r\nadded to the above amount, their total numbers would still remain\r\nvery inconsiderable, and infinitely inferior to what is required,\r\nnot only for the tillage of the estates, but even for the royal works.\r\n\r\n[Substitute laborers wanting.] As, therefore, the Japanese have totally\r\ndisappeared, and the number of Chinese is evidently inadequate to the\r\nwants of agriculture, it almost necessarily follows that the practice\r\nof distributing the Filipino laborers, as allowed by the aforesaid\r\nlaws of the Indies, under all circumstances, is the only alternate\r\nleft. Even if, against the adoption of this measure, it should be\r\nattempted to urge the ambiguous sense of the concluding part of the\r\nsecond clause, it would be easy to comprehend its true intent and\r\nmeaning, by referring to Law 1, Title 13, Book 5, which says:\r\n\r\n\"That, considering the inconveniences which would arise from doing\r\naway with certain distributions of grounds, gardens, estates, and\r\nother plantations, in which the Indians are interested, as a matter\r\non which the preservation of those distant dominions and provinces\r\ndepends, it is ordained that compulsory labor, and such distributions\r\nas are advantageous to the public good, shall continue.\"\r\n\r\nAfter so pointed an explanation, and a manifestation so clear of\r\nthe spirit of our legislation in this respect, all further comments\r\nwould be useless, and no doubt whatever can be any longer entertained\r\nof the expediency, and even of the justice of putting the plan of\r\nwell-regulated distributions in practice, as a powerful means to\r\npromote the agriculture, and secure to Spain the possession of these\r\nvaluable dominions of the Indian Seas. ....\r\n\r\n[Manufactures.] .... It would be impossible to gainsay Don Juan\r\nFrancisco Urroz, of the Philippine Company, in his detailed and\r\naccurate report to the managing committee in 1802, when he observes:\r\n\r\n\"That the Philippine Islands, from time immemorial, were acquainted\r\nwith, and still retain, that species of industry peculiar to the\r\ncountry, adapted to the customs and wants of the natives, and which\r\nconstitutes the chief branch of their clothing. This, although\r\nconfined to coarse articles, may in its class be called perfect, as\r\nfar as it answers the end for which it is intended; and if an attempt\r\nwere made to enumerate the quantity of mats, handkerchiefs, sheeting,\r\nand a variety of other cloths manufactured for this purpose only in\r\nthe Provinces of Tondo, Laguna, Batangas, Ilocos, Cagayan, Camarines,\r\nAlbay, Visaya, etc., immense supplies of each kind would appear, which\r\ngive occupation to an incalculable number of looms, indistinctly worked\r\nby Indians, Chinese, and Sangleyan mestizos, indeed all the classes,\r\nin their own humble dwellings, built of canes and thatched with palm\r\nleaves, without any apparatus of regular manufacture.\"\r\n\r\n[Native cloth weaving.] With equal truth am I enabled to add, that the\r\nnatural abilities of these natives in the manufacture of all kinds of\r\ncloths, fine as well as coarse, are really admirable. They succeed\r\nin reducing the harsh filaments of the palm-tree, known by the name\r\nof abaca, to such a degree of fineness, that they afterwards convert\r\nthem into textures equal to the best muslins of Bengal. The beauty\r\nand evenness of their embroideries and open work excite surprise;\r\nin short, the damask table-cloths, ornamental weaving, textures of\r\ncotton and palm-fibres, intermixed with silk, and manufactured in the\r\nabove-mentioned provinces, clearly prove how much the inhabitants of\r\nthe Philippine Islands, in natural abilities and dexterity, resemble\r\nthe other people of the Asiatic regions. It must nevertheless be\r\nallowed, that a want is noticed of that finish and polish which the\r\nperfection of art gives to each commodity; but this circumstance\r\nought not to appear strange, if we consider that, entirely devoid of\r\nall methodical instruction, and ignorant also of the importance of\r\nthe subdivision of labor, which contributes so greatly to simplify,\r\nshorten, and improve the respective excellence of all kinds of works,\r\nthe same natives gin and clean the cotton, and then spin and weave it,\r\nwithout any other instruments than their hands and feet, aided only by\r\nthe course and unsightly looms they themselves construct in a corner\r\nof their huts, with scarcely anything else than a few canes and sticks.\r\n\r\n[Aptitude for, but no development of, manufacturing.] From the\r\npreceding observations it may easily be deduced that, although\r\nthe natives succeed in preparing, with admirable dexterity, the\r\nproductions of their soil, and therewith satisfy the greatest part of\r\ntheir domestic wants, facts which certainly manifest their talents\r\nand aptitude to be employed in works of more taste and delicacy,\r\nmanufacturing industry is nevertheless far from being generalized,\r\nnor can it be said to be placed with any degree of solidity on its\r\ntrue and proper basis. Hence arise those great supplies of goods\r\nannually imported into the country, for the purpose of making up the\r\ndeficiencies of the local manufactures.\r\n\r\n[Improved methods and machinery needed.] The regular distribution or\r\nclassification of the assemblage of operations which follow each other\r\nin graduation, from the rough preparation of the first materials, till\r\nthe same have arrived at their perfect state of manufacture, instead\r\nof being practiced, is entirely unknown. The want of good machinery\r\nto free the cotton from the multitude of seeds with which it is\r\nencumbered, so as to perform the operation with ease and quickness, is\r\nthe first and greatest obstacle that occurs; and its tediousness to the\r\nnatives is so repugnant, that many sell their crops to others, without\r\nseparating the seeds, or decline growing the article altogether, not\r\nto be plagued with the trouble of cleaning it. As the want of method\r\nis also equal to the superabundance or waste of time employed, the\r\nexpenses of the goods manufactured increased in the same proportion,\r\nunder such evident and great disadvantages; for which reason, far from\r\nbeing able to compete with those brought from China and British India,\r\nthey only acquire estimation in the interior, when wanted to supply\r\nthe place of the latter, or in cases of accidental scarcity.\r\n\r\n[Scanty exports.] In a word, the only manufactured articles annually\r\nexported from the Philippine Islands are eight to twelve thousand\r\npieces exports of light sail cloth, two hundred thousand pounds of\r\nabaca cordage assorted, and six hundred carabao hides and deer skins,\r\nwhich can scarcely be considered in a tanned state/ for, although the\r\nRoyal Company, from the time of their establishment, long continued to\r\nexport considerable quantities of dimities, calicos, stripes, checks,\r\nand coverlids, as well as other cotton and silk goods, it was more\r\nwith a view to stimulate the districts of Ilocos to continue in the\r\nhabit of manufacturing, and thus introduce among the inhabitants of\r\nthat province a taste for industry, than the expectation of gain by\r\nthe sale of this kind of merchandise either in Spain or any of the\r\nsections of America. At length, wearied with the losses experienced by\r\ncarrying on this species of mercantile operations, without answering\r\nthe principal object in view, they resolved, for the time being,\r\nto suspend ventures attended with such discouraging circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Need of encouragement.] Notwithstanding so many impediments, it\r\nwould not, however, be prudent in the government entirely to abandon\r\nthe enterprise, and lose sight of the advantages the country offers,\r\nor indeed, to neglect turning the habitual facilities of the natives\r\nto some account. Far from there existing any positive grounds for\r\ndespairing of the progress of manufacturing industry, it may justly\r\nbe presumed that, whenever the sovereign, by adopting a different line\r\nof policy, shall allow the unlimited and indistinct settlement of all\r\nkinds of foreign colonists, and grant them the same facilities and\r\nprotection enjoyed by national ones, they will be induced to flock to\r\nthe Philippine Islands in considerable numbers, lured by the hope of\r\naccumulating fortunes in a country that presents a thousand attractions\r\nof every kind. Many, no doubt, will preferably devote themselves\r\nto commerce, others to agricultural undertakings and also to the\r\npursuits of mining, but necessarily some will turn their attention\r\nand employ their funds in the formation of extensive manufactures,\r\naided by intelligent instructors and suitable machinery. The\r\nnewly-introduced information and arts being thus diffused, it is\r\nnatural to expect they will be progressively adopted by a people\r\nalready possessing a taste and genius for this species of labor,\r\nby which means manufacturing industry will soon be raised from the\r\nstate of neglect and unprofitableness in which it is now left.\r\n\r\n[Internal commerce handicapped.] The circulation of the country\r\nproductions and effects of all kinds among the inhabitants of the\r\nprovinces, which, properly speaking, constitutes their internal\r\ncommerce, is tolerably active and considerable. Owing to the great\r\nfacilities of conveyance afforded by the number of rivers and lakes, on\r\nthe margins of which the Filipinos are fond of fixing their dwellings,\r\nthis commerce might be infinitely greater, if it was not obstructed\r\nby the monopoly of the magistrates in their respective districts\r\nand the unjust prerogative, exercised by the city, of imposing\r\nrates and arbitrary prices on the very persons who come to bring the\r\nsupplies. Nevertheless, as the iniquituous operations of the district\r\nmagistrates, however, active they may be, besides being restricted\r\nby their financial ability, regularly consist of arrangements to buy\r\nup only the chief articles, and those which promise most advantage,\r\nwith least trouble; as that restless inquietude which impels man on,\r\nunder the hope of bettering his condition, acts even amidst rigor of\r\noppression, a certain degree of stimulus and scope is still left in\r\nfavor of internal trade.\r\n\r\n[Inter-island traffic.] Hence it follows, that there is scarcely an\r\nisland or province, that does not carry on some traffic or other,\r\nby keeping up relations with its neighbors, which sometimes extend\r\nas far as the capital; where, in proportion as the produce and raw\r\nmaterials find a ready market, returns suitable and adequate to the\r\nconsumption of each place, respectively, are obtained. If, however, it\r\nwould be difficult to form an idea, even in the way of approximation,\r\nof the exchanges which take place between the various provinces,\r\na task that would render it necessary to enumerate them, one by one,\r\nit is equally so to make an estimate of the total amount of this class\r\nof operation carried on in Manila, their common center. Situated in\r\nthe bottom of an immense bay, bathed by a large river, and the country\r\nround divided by an infinite number of streams and lakes descending\r\nfrom the provinces by which the capital is surrounded, the produce and\r\neffects are daily brought in and go out of suburbs so extended in a\r\ndiversity of small vessels and canoes, without its being possible to\r\nobtain any exact account of the multiplicity of transactions carried\r\non at one and the same time, in a city built on so large a scale.\r\n\r\n[Local markets.] Besides the traffic founded on ordinary consumption,\r\nthe necessity of obtaining assortments of home-manufactured as well\r\nas imported goods, in order to supply the markets, known by the name\r\nof tianguis, and which are held weekly in almost every town, there\r\nis another species of speculation, peculiar to the rich natives\r\nand Sangley mestizos, an industrious race, and also possessed of\r\nthe largest portion of the specie. This consists in the anticipated\r\npurchase of the crops of indigo, sugar, rice, etc., with a view to fix\r\ntheir own prices on the produce thus contracted for, when resold to the\r\nsecond hand. A propensity to barter and traffic, in all kinds of ways,\r\nis indeed universal among the natives, and as the principal springs\r\nwhich urge on internal circulation are already in motion, nothing\r\nmore is wanting than at once to destroy the obstacles previously\r\npointed out, and encourage the extension of luxury and comforts,\r\nin order that, by the number of the people's wants being increased,\r\nas well as the means of supplying them, the force and velocity of\r\naction may in the same proportion be augmented.\r\n\r\n[External commerce.] Under \"External Commerce\" generally are comprised\r\nthe relations the Philippine Islands keep up with other nations, with\r\nthe Spanish possessions in America, and with the mother country; or,\r\nin other words, the sum total of their imports and exports.\r\n\r\n[Outside deterrents.] Many are the causes which, within the last\r\nten or twelve years, have influenced the mercantile relations of\r\nthese Islands, and prevented their organization on permanent and\r\nknown principles. The chief one, no doubt, has been the frequent and\r\nunforeseen changes, from peace to war, which have marked that unhappy\r\nperiod, and as under similar circumstances merchants, more than\r\nany other class of persons, are in the habit of acting on extremes,\r\nthere have been occasions in which, misled by the exaggerated idea\r\nof the galleon of Acapulco, and anxious to avail themselves of the\r\nfirst prices, generally also the highest, foreign speculators have\r\ninundated Manila with goods, by a competition from all quarters; and\r\nothers, owing to the channels being obstructed, when this market has\r\nexperienced an absolute scarcity of commodities, as well as of funds\r\nnecessary to continue the usual and almost only branch of commerce\r\nleft. The frequent failure of the sugar and indigo crops, has also\r\nin many instances restrained the North Americans and other neutrals\r\nfrom coming to these Islands with cargoes, and induced them to prefer\r\nJava, where they are at all times sure of finding returns. Besides\r\nthe influence of these extraordinary causes on the uncertainty\r\nand irregularity of external commerce, no small share must also be\r\nattributed to the strangeness of the peculiar constitution of the\r\ncountry, or the principles on which its trade is established.\r\n\r\n[Domestic discouragements.] Scarcely will it be believed, in the\r\ngreater part of civilized Europe, that a Spanish colony exists between\r\nAsia and America, whose merchants are forbidden to avail themselves\r\nof their advantageous situation, and that, as a special favor only\r\nare they allowed to send their effects to Mexico, once a year, but\r\nunder the following restrictions. It is a necessary condition, that\r\nevery shipper shall be a member of the Board of Trade (Consulado),\r\nand therein entitled to a vote, which supposes a residence of some\r\nyears in the country, besides the possession of property of his own to\r\nthe amount of $8,000. He is compelled to join with the other members,\r\nin order to be enabled to ship his goods in bales of a determined\r\nform and dimensions, in one single vessel, arranged, fitted out,\r\nand commanded by officers of the royal navy, under the character of a\r\nwar ship. He has also to contribute his proportion of $20,000, which,\r\nin the shape of a present, are given to the commander, at the end of\r\nevery round voyage. He cannot in any way interfere in the choice or\r\nqualities of the vessel, notwithstanding his property is to be risked\r\nin her; and what completes the extravagance of the system, is, that\r\nbefore anything is done he must pay down twenty-five or forty per cent\r\nfor freight, according to circumstances, which money is distributed\r\namong certain canons of the church, aldermen, subalterns of the army,\r\nand widows of Spaniards, to whom a given number of tickets or certified\r\npermits to ship are granted, either as a compensation for the smallness\r\nof their pay, or in the way of a privilege; but on express conditions\r\nthat, although they themselves are not members of the Board of Trade,\r\nthey shall not be allowed to negotiate and transfer them to persons\r\nnot having that quality. In the custom house nothing being admitted\r\nunless the number of bales shipped are accompanied by corresponding\r\npermits, and as it besides frequently happens that there is a degree\r\nof competition between the parties seeking to try their fortune in\r\nthis way, the original holders of the permits very often hang back,\r\nin such a manner that I have seen $500 offered for the transfer of\r\na right to ship three bales, which scarcely contained goods to the\r\namount of $1,000. Such, nevertheless, is the truth, and such the\r\nexact description of the famous Acapulco ship, which has excited so\r\nmuch jealousy among the merchants of Seville and Cadiz, and given\r\nrise to such an infinite number of disputes and lawsuits.\r\n\r\n[Business irregularities.] So complete a deviation from the rules\r\nand maxims usually received in trade, could not fail to produce\r\nin the Philippine Islands, as in fact it has, effects equally\r\nextraordinary with regard to those who follow this pursuit. The\r\nmerchant of Manila is, in fact, entirely different from the one in\r\nCadiz or Amsterdam. Without any correspondents in the manufacturing\r\ncountries and consequently possessed of no suitable advices of the\r\nfavorable variations in the respective markets, without brokers and\r\neven without regular books he seems to carry on his profession on\r\nno one fixed principle, and to have acquired his routine of business\r\nfrom mere habit and vague custom. His contracts are made out on stamped\r\npaper, and his bills or promissory notes no other than long and diffuse\r\nwritings or bonds, of which the dates and amounts are kept more in\r\nthe shape of bundles than by any due entry on his books; and what at\r\nonce gives the most clear idea of this irregularity is the singular\r\nfact that, for the space of twenty-five and possibly fifty years,\r\nonly one bankrupt has presented the state of his affairs to the Board\r\nof Trade, in conformity to the regulations prescribed by the general\r\nStatutes of Bankruptcy, whereas, numbers of cases have occurred in\r\nwhich these merchants have wasted or secreted the property of others\r\nwith impunity. Hence have arisen those irregularities, subterfuges\r\nand disputes, in a word, the absence of all mercantile business\r\ncarried on in a scrupulously punctual and correct manner. Hence, also,\r\nhave followed that distrust and embarrassment with which commercial\r\noperations are attended, as well as the difficulty of calculating\r\ntheir fluctuations. On the other hand, as in order to send off an\r\nexpedition by the annual ship to Acapulco, the previous consent\r\nof the majority of the incorporated merchants is necessary, before\r\nthis point is decided, months are passed in intrigues and disputes,\r\nthe peremptory period arrives, and if the articles wanted are in the\r\nmarket, they are purchased up with precipitation and paid for with\r\nthe monies the shippers have been able to obtain at an interest from\r\nthe administrators of pious and charitable funds. In this manner,\r\ncompelled to act almost always without plan or concert, yet accustomed\r\nto gain in the market of Acapulco, notwithstanding so many impediments\r\nand the exorbitant premiums paid for the money lent, these merchants\r\nfollow the strange maxim of risking little or no property of their\r\nown; and unaware, or rather, disregarding the importance of economy\r\nin the expenses and regularity of their general method of living,\r\nit is not possible they can ever accumulate large fortunes, or form\r\nsolid and well-accredited houses.\r\n\r\n[Merchants discouraged.] Thus oppressed by a system, as unjust as it\r\nis absurd, and conducting their affairs in the way above described,\r\nit is not strange that these gentlemen, at the same time yielding to\r\nthe indolence consequent on the climate, should neglect or behold with\r\nindifference all the other secondary resources which the supplying\r\nthe wants of the country and the extensive scope and variety of its\r\nproduce offer to the man of active mind. Hence it follows, as already\r\nobserved, that the whole of the interior trade is at present absorbed\r\nby the principal natives, the Sangley mestizos of both sexes, and a\r\nfew Chinese peddlers.\r\n\r\n[The outlook brightening.] Notwithstanding, however, the defective\r\nmanner in which the generality of the merchants act, some already\r\nare beginning to distinguish themselves by the prudence of their\r\nconduct, by forwarding, in time, their orders to the manufacturers\r\nof India and China, and, in other respects guiding themselves by the\r\nprinciples which characterize the intelligent merchant. Finally, it\r\nis to be presumed that, as soon as the government shall have thrown\r\ndown this singular and preposterous system that has been the cause of\r\nso many disorders, and proclaimed the unlimited freedom of Philippine\r\ncommerce, the greater part of these people will rise up from the state\r\nof inaction in which they now live, and the relations of the colony\r\nwill then assume the course and extent corresponding to its advantages\r\nof position. At least, if our national merchants should not act up\r\nto the impulse given to all kinds of mercantile enterprises by the\r\nbeneficial hand of the sovereign, foreigners will not be wanting, who,\r\nrelying on due toleration, will be induced to convey their fortunes\r\nand families to the Philippine Islands, and, vigorously encouraging\r\nthe exportation of their valuable productions, amply secure the fruits\r\nof their laudable activity and well-combined speculations.\r\n\r\n[Capital employed in commerce.] Were a person, judging from the\r\nnumbers constituting the body of registered merchants, and supposing\r\nall of them to possess the essential requisites prescribed by our\r\ncommercial regulations, to form a prudent estimate of the amount of\r\ncapital employed by them, his calculations would turn out extremely\r\nerroneous, for besides the case with which regulations of this kind\r\nare eluded, many are merely nominal traders, and there are others whose\r\nmercantile existence is purely artificial for they are sustained in a\r\ntemporary manner, by means of a forced species of circulation peculiar\r\nto this country. This consists in obtaining the acquiescence of the\r\nadministrators of pious and charitable funds, let out at interest,\r\nto renew the bonds they hold during other successive risks, waiting,\r\nas it were, till some fatal tempest has swallowed up the vessel in\r\nwhich these merchants suppose their property to be embarked, and\r\nat once cancel all their obligations. On the other hand, neither\r\nexcessive expenses nor the shipment of large quantities of goods to\r\nAcapulco can in any way be taken as a just criterion whereby to judge\r\nof the fortunes of individuals; because, in the first, there is great\r\nuniformity, every one, more or less, enjoying, exteriorly, the same\r\neasy circumstances, notwithstanding the disparity of real property;\r\nand in the second, considerable fiction prevails, many persons\r\nshipping under the same mark, and even when the shipper stands alone,\r\nhe might have been provided with the necessary funds from the pious\r\nand charitable establishments, possibly without risking a dollar\r\nof his own in the whole operation. Under circumstances so dubious,\r\nfar from presuming to give a decided opinion on the subject, I am\r\ncompelled to judge from mere conjectures, and guided only by the\r\nknowledge and experience I have been able to acquire during my long\r\nresidence there. In conformity thereto, I am inclined to believe,\r\nthat the total amount of capital belonging to and employed in the\r\ntrade of the Philippine Islands, does not at present exceed two\r\nand a half million dollars, with evident signs of rapid decline, if\r\nthe merchants do not in time abandon the ruinous systems of chiefly\r\ncarrying on their speculations with money obtained at interest.\r\n\r\n[Large sums hoarded.] The two and a half million dollars thus\r\nattributed to the merchants, form, however, the smaller part of the\r\nfunds distributed among the other classes, and the total amount of\r\nthe circulating medium of the colony might be considered an object\r\nsufficiently worthy of being ascertained, owing to the great light\r\nit would throw on the present state of the inhabitants; but it is in\r\nvain to attempt any calculation of the kind, at least without the aid\r\nof data possessing a certain degree of accuracy. The only thing that\r\ncan be affirmed is, that during the period of more than two hundred\r\nand fifty years which have elapsed since the conquest, the ingress of\r\nspecie into the Philippine Islands has been constant. Their annual\r\nships have seldom come from New Spain without bringing considerable\r\nsums in return, and if some of them have been lost, many others,\r\nwithout being confined to the one million of dollars constituting\r\nthe ordinary amount of the permit, have not unfrequently come back\r\nwith triple that sum; for which reason there are ample grounds of\r\njudging the estimates correct, which fix the total importation of\r\ndollars, during the whole of that long period of years, to be equal\r\nto four hundred millions. It may further be observed that, as in\r\nthe Sangley mestizos economy and avarice compete with intelligence\r\nand activity in accumulating wealth and as they are scattered, among\r\nthe principal islands, and in possession of the best lands and the\r\nmost lucrative business of the interior, there are ample motives for\r\npresuming that these industrious and sagacious people have gradually,\r\nalthough incessantly, amassed immense sums in specie; but it would\r\nbe impossible to point out their amount, distribution, or the secret\r\nplaces in which they are hoarded.\r\n\r\n[Pious and charitable funds' capital.] The assemblage of pious\r\nlegacies, temporalities, and other funds and property placed under\r\nthe care of several administrative committees, for purposes as well\r\nreligious as charitable, constitute the chief capital employed in\r\nexternal trade; and notwithstanding the failures, which from time\r\nto time occur, the subsequent accumulation of the enormous premiums\r\nobtained for funds laid out in maritime speculations, both in time of\r\npeace and war, not only suffices to make up all losses of the above\r\nkind, but also to secure the punctual payment of such charitable\r\npensions and other charges as are to be deducted from the respective\r\nprofits of this species of stock, its total amount, according to an\r\nofficial report made by order of the head committee of the sinking\r\nfund, including temporalities, and Queen Maria of Austria's endowment\r\nfor the College of Las Marianas, together with other funds of the same\r\nkind, not comprehended in the decree of abolition, at the commencement\r\nof the year 1809, amounted to $2,470,390, and as the sea-risks of that\r\nand the following year were successful, and the outstanding amounts\r\npunctually recovered, the aggregate sum, arising out of the above\r\ndescription of property, may now be estimated at more than three\r\nmillions. Of these funds three distributions are generally made,\r\nviz., one part is appropriated to the China risks, at from twelve\r\nto eighteen per cent. premium, according to circumstances, and also\r\nthose to Madras, Calcutta and Batavia, at from sixteen to twenty-two\r\nper cent. The second, which generally is in the largest proportion,\r\nis employed in risks to Acapulco, at various premiums, from 27 to 45\r\nper cent.; and the third is left in hand, as a kind of guarantee of\r\nthe stability of the original endowments.\r\n\r\n[Coveted by Spanish treasury.] In the great exigencies of the Royal\r\nTreasury, experienced during the last years of the administration\r\nof Sr. Soler, the royal decree of Consolidación was extended to the\r\nPhilippine Islands, under the pretext of guarding the funds belonging\r\nto public charities and religious endowments ... sea-risks, the\r\nincome of which, when secured on good mortgages, does not generally\r\nexceed five per cent, many in Spain not yielding above four; but the\r\nremarkable difference between this plan and the one above described,\r\ntogether with various and other weighty reasons alleged by the\r\nadministrators, caused the dreaded effect of this new regulation to\r\nbe suspended, and whilst the head committee of Manila were consulting\r\ntheir doubts and requesting fresh instructions from the court at home,\r\norders came out not to make any alteration in measures relating to\r\nthis description of property.\r\n\r\n[Easy capital but lessened profits.] Accustomed, in their limited\r\ncalculations, to identify the resources, offered by the funds belonging\r\nto this class of establishments, with the very existence of the\r\ncolony, the needy merchants easily confound their personal with the\r\ngeneral interest; and few stop to consider that the identical means\r\nof carrying on trade, without any capital of their own, although they\r\nhave accidentally enriched a small number of persons, eventually have\r\nabsorbed the principal profits, and possibly been the chief cause\r\nof the unflourishing state of the colony at large. Without fearing\r\nthe charge of rashness, it may, in fact, be asserted, that if these\r\ncharities and pious endowments had never existed, public prosperity\r\nin the Philippine Islands would, as in other parts, have been the\r\nimmediate effect of the united efforts of the individual members\r\nof the community and of the experience acquired in the constant\r\nprosecution of the same object. As, however, a progress of this kind,\r\nalthough certain, must necessarily have been at first extremely\r\nslow, and as, on the other hand, the preference given to mercantile\r\noperations undertaken with the funds belonging to public charities,\r\nhas its origin in the assemblage of vices so remarkable in the very\r\norganization of the body of Philippine merchants, any new measure on\r\nthis subject might be deemed inconsistent, that at once deprived them\r\nof the use of resources on which they had been accustomed to rely,\r\nwithout removing those other defects which excuse, if not encourage,\r\nthe continuation of the present system. Without, therefore, appealing\r\nto violent remedies, it is to be hoped that, in order to render plans\r\nof reform effectual, it will be sufficient, under more propitious\r\ncircumstances, to see property brought from other countries to these\r\nIslands, as well as persons coming to settle in them, capable of\r\nmanaging it with that intelligence and economy required by trade. The\r\ncompetition of those who speculate at random would then cease, or\r\nwhat is the same, as money obtained at a premium could not then be\r\nlaid out with the same advantages by the merchants as if it was their\r\nown, it will be necessary to renounce the fallacious profits held out\r\nby the public charities, till at least they are placed on a level\r\nwith existing circumstances, and brought in to be of real service\r\nto the honorable planter and laborious merchant, in their accidental\r\nexigencies, ceasing to be, as hitherto, the indirect cause of idleness,\r\ndissipation, and the ruin of an infinite number of families.\r\n\r\n[Mercantile shipping.] The vessels which the district magistrates of\r\nthe provinces employ in carrying on their trade with the capital and\r\nthose belonging to some of the richer merchants, together with such as\r\nare owned by the natives and mestizos, on an approximate calculation,\r\namount to twelve thousand tons, including ships, brigs, schooners,\r\ngalleys, barges, etc. For the want of better data, this estimate\r\nis founded only on reasonable conjecture, aided by the advice of\r\nexperienced persons, for although the greatest part of these vessels\r\nare built by the natives in the neighborhood of their own towns, no\r\nregister is kept of their number and dimensions, nor do they carry\r\nwith them the usual certificates. Those belonging to the merchants,\r\nthat is, ships and brigs of a certain size, have already begun to\r\nfrequent the ports of China, Java, the coast of Coromandel, Bengal,\r\nand the Isle of France, availing themselves of the lucrative freights\r\nwhich formerly enriched and encouraged foreign shipping. The other\r\nclass of vessels, although perfectly adequate to the coasting trade,\r\ncannot in general be applied to larger enterprises, on account of\r\ntheir not being sufficiently strong and capacious. The seamen are\r\nnot apprenticed, or as it is usually called, matriculated, but\r\ntheir frequent crossing from island to island, their familiarity\r\nwith regional tempests, voyages to various parts of America, and\r\nthe occupation of fishing followed by the inhabitants of the coast,\r\nserve to train up a large body of dexterous and able mariners who at\r\nall times can be had, without any compulsion, to complete the crews.\r\n\r\n[Need of nautical school.] The want of a public school for the\r\nteaching of navigation, is, however, sensibly felt, as well as great\r\ninconvenience from the scarcity of persons capable of being trusted\r\nwith the command of vessels, and the ignorance that prevails of the\r\nwaters of this dangerous Archipelago. Repeated royal orders have\r\nbeen sent over for the board of trade to proceed to the institution\r\nof so useful an establishment, and in the meantime, a medium has\r\nbeen resorted to in order to supply the deficiency, by allowing\r\nthe free admission of foreign mates, provided they exhibit proofs\r\nof their acquaintance with navigation, and profess the Catholic\r\nworship. Shipowners nevertheless experience great difficulties,\r\nparticularly at times when the Acapulco ship is fitting out, for\r\nalthough she is considered as a vessel of war, and commanded by\r\nofficers of the royal navy, the plan of her equipment is so singular,\r\nthat in addition, she requires the extra aid of one chief mate,\r\nand three under ones.\r\n\r\n[Royal Phillipine company.] The various modifications this corporate\r\nbody has successively experienced, have, in great measure, changed\r\nthe essence of its original constitution, and the remonstrances of\r\nits directors, founded on the experience of a long series of years, at\r\nlength induced the government at home to sanction alterations dictated\r\nby existing circumstances. The project of raising these Islands\r\nfrom the neglected state in which they were, and in some measure to\r\nplace them in contact with the mother country, accompanied by a wish\r\nto give a new and great impulse to the various branches of industry\r\nwhich constitute the importance of a colony, could not have been more\r\nlaudable; but, as was afterwards seen, the instrument employed was\r\nnot adequate to the object in view. At the same time that the company\r\nwere charged to promote, and, by means of their funds, to vivify the\r\nagriculture and industry of these provinces, the necessary powers\r\nand facilities to enable them to reap the fruits of their sacrifices\r\nwere withheld. The protection granted to this establishment, did not\r\ngo beyond a general recommendation in favor of its enterprises, and,\r\nin short, far from enjoying the exclusive preponderance obtained at\r\ntheir commencement by all the other Asiatic companies, that of the\r\nPhilippine Islands labored under particular disadvantages.\r\n\r\n[Local progress under adverse conditions.] Notwithstanding an\r\norganization so imperfect, scarcely had the agents of the new\r\nCompany arrived at Manila, when they distributed through the country\r\ntheir numerous dependents, commissioned to encourage the natives\r\nby advances of money. They established subaltern factories in the\r\nProvinces of Ilocos, Bataan, Cavite, and Camarines; purchased lands;\r\ndelivered out agricultural implements; founded manufacturies of cotton\r\ncloths; contracted for the crops of produce at very high prices;\r\noffered rewards and, in short, they put in motion every partial\r\nresources they were able to avail themselves of and their limited\r\nmeans allowed. It would be extremely easy for me, in this place,\r\nto enter a particular enumeration of the important services of this\r\nkind rendered by the company, and to exhibit, in the most evident\r\npoint of view, the advantages thence derived to these Islands,\r\nif, besides being slightly touched upon in the preceding articles,\r\nthis task had not been already ably performed by the Factor Don Juan\r\nFrancisco Urroz, in his accurate report on this subject, addressed\r\nto the governing committee of the company, in 1803. In justice I will\r\nnevertheless observe, that this establishment, anxiously resolved to\r\nattain the end proposed, in spite of so many obstacles, constantly\r\nfollowed up its expensive system without being disheartened; nor\r\ndid the contrarieties with which the Royal Audiencia, or High Court\r\nof Justice, frequently paralyzed its plans, the indifference of the\r\ngovernors, or the general opposition and jealousy of the other classes,\r\nin any way tend to relax its efforts, till at length, convinced of\r\nthe impossibility of successfully contending, alone and without any\r\nother arms than its own reduced capital; and, on the other hand,\r\nwell aware that a political body of this kind in vain seeks to unite\r\nwithin itself the triple and opposite characters of agriculturalist,\r\nmanufacturer, and merchant, a determination was taken to alter the\r\nplan, and withdraw the factories established in the provinces, and\r\nby adopting a rigid economy and confining the operations in future\r\nto the purchase of such produce and manufactured articles as suited\r\ntheir trade, and were voluntarily brought by the natives to their\r\nstores, the expenses of the Company were curtailed, and a plan of\r\nreform introduced into all their speculations. By this means also\r\nthey always secured an advantageous vent for the productions of the\r\ncountry, after having been the chief spring by which agriculture was\r\npromoted and encouraged in a direct manner.\r\n\r\n[Handicapped in outside trade] The most beneficial reform, however,\r\nintroduced by this establishment into its system, has, in reality,\r\nbeen derived from the variation or rather correction of its plans and\r\nenterprises, purely maritime. The government being desirous to increase\r\nthe relations of this colony by every possible means, and to convert it\r\ninto a common center of all the operations of the new company, at first\r\nrequired of the agents that the purchases and collection of goods from\r\nthe coast of Coromandel, Bengal, and China, destined for Spain, should\r\ntake place at Manila, either by purchasing the articles in that market,\r\nor through the medium of previous contracts to deliver them there. From\r\nthis it is easy to infer, that the company was infallibly exposed to\r\nthe harsh terms the respective contractors sought to impose upon them,\r\nas well with regard to prices as qualities, unless, in many cases,\r\nthey preferred being left without the necessary assortments. Hence may\r\nit, without the smallest exaggeration, be affirmed, that, summing up\r\nall the surcharges under which the shipments left the port of Manila,\r\nand comparing them with those which might have been sent direct from\r\nthe above-mentioned points, and without so extraordinary a détour\r\nas the one prescribed by law, the difference that followed in the\r\nprime cost of the cargos was not less than 80 per cent. The urgent\r\nmanner, however, in which the directors of the company did not\r\ncease to deplore and complain of so evident a hardship, at length\r\nhad the desired effect, and after existing ten or twelve years, so\r\npreposterous a system was successfully overthrown, and permission\r\nobtained from the king for the establishment of Spanish factories in\r\nthe neighborhood of the China and India manufactures, as well as the\r\npower of addressing shipments direct to those foreign dominions. The\r\nenlightened policy of their respective governments did not allow them\r\nto hesitate in giving a favorable reception to our factors and vessels,\r\nand the purchases and shipments of Asiatic goods being thus realized\r\nwithout the old obstructions, the Company was reasonably led to hope\r\nbeing able soon to increase its operations, and progressively present\r\nmore satisfactory results to the shareholders, when those political\r\nconvulsions succeeding soon after, which have unhinged or destroyed\r\nall the ordinary relations of trade, compelled them to abandon their\r\nhopes, till the wished-for calm should be again restored.\r\n\r\n[Temporary expedient of 1803.] In consequence of the new character\r\nand route given to the commercial enterprises of the Company, as\r\nauthorized by a royal decree of July 12, 1803, the functions of\r\nthe Manila factors were reduced to the annual shipment of a cargo\r\nof Asiatic goods to Peru, valued at $500,000, but only as long\r\nas the war lasted, and till the expiration of the extraordinary\r\npermits granted through the goodness of the king, and also to the\r\ntransmitting to China and Bengal of the specie brought from America,\r\nand the collecting of certain quantities of indigo, sugar, or other\r\nproduce of the Islands, with a view to gain by reselling it in the\r\nsame market. Consequently, the moment things return to their pacific\r\nand ordinary course, will be the period when the necessity of the\r\nfuture existence of this establishment will cease, or at least,\r\nwhen the propriety will be evident of its reform or assimilation to\r\nthe other commission houses, carrying on trade in Vera Cruz, Mexico,\r\netc., which, not being hired establishments, do not create expenses\r\nwhen they cease to transact business.\r\n\r\n[Competition of foreign merchants.] Against a measure of this kind\r\nit would be useless to allege, that, \"by the exclusive privilege to\r\nintroduce spirits and European effects into the colony, the Company\r\nhas contracted the obligation of always keeping it properly supplied;\r\nthat their very institution had for the basis the general improvement\r\nof the Islands, and in order duly to comply with these duties, it\r\nbecomes indispensably necessary to keep up the present expensive\r\nestablishment;\" for, in the first place, in order, to render it\r\nincumbent on the company to introduce an indefinite quantity of\r\nEuropean articles, it previously would be necessary to provide a vent\r\nfor them, and this can never be the case, unless the exclusion of all\r\ncompetitors in the market is rigorously carried into effect. As things\r\nnow are, the North Americans, English, French, and every other nation\r\nthat wishes, openly usurped this privilege, by constantly inundating\r\nthe Islands with spirits and all kinds of effects, and it is very\r\nevident that this same abuse which authorizes the infraction of the\r\nabove privilege, if in that light it could in any way be considered,\r\ntotally exonerates the company from all obligations by them contracted\r\nunder a different understanding. Besides, the circumstances which\r\nhave taken place since the publication of the royal decree, creating\r\nthe above establishment into a corporate body, in the year 1785,\r\nhave entirely changed the order established in this respect. In the\r\nfirst place, the port of Manila has been opened to foreign nations,\r\nin consequence of the disinterested representations of the company\r\nitself, and for the direct advantage of general trade; nor was it\r\nnecessary to prevent our new guests from abusing the facilities thus\r\ngranted to them, and much less to confine them to the mere introduction\r\nof Asiatic goods, the original plea made use of. In the second, as\r\nsoon as the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands became familiar with\r\nthe more useful and elegant objects of convenience and luxury, which\r\nthey were enabled to purchase from foreigners, at reasonable prices,\r\nit was natural for them to pay little regard to the superfluous aid\r\nof the company, more particularly when the latter were no longer\r\nable to sustain the competition, either in the sale or supply of a\r\nmultitude of articles, which, thanks to our own national simplicity,\r\nare scarcely known in Spain, whence their outward-bound cargoes are\r\ndivided. Hence it follows that, far from the importation and supplies\r\nof the company being missed, it may with great reason be presumed,\r\nthat this formal renunciation of this ideal privilege of theirs,\r\nmust rather have contributed to secure, in a permanent manner,\r\nadequate supplies for all the wants and whims of the inhabitants of\r\nthe colony; and that the publicity of such a determination would act\r\nas a fresh allurement successively to bring to the port of Manila a\r\nhost of foreign speculators, anxious to avail themselves of a fresh\r\nopening for commercial pursuits.\r\n\r\n[Company not a philanthropy.] The other objection, founded on the\r\nmistaken notion of its being inherent in, and belonging to, the very\r\nessence of the company, to promote the general improvement of the\r\nPhilippine Islands, if well considered, will appear equally unjust. It\r\nis, in fact, a ridiculous, although too generally received, a prejudice\r\nto suppose, that the founders of this establishment proposed to\r\nthemselves the plan of sinking the money of the shareholders in\r\nclearing the lands, and perfecting the rude manufactures of these\r\ndistant Islands. To imagine this to have been one of the principal\r\nobjects of the institution, or to suppose that, on this hard condition,\r\ntheir various privileges and exemptions were granted to them, is so\r\nfar from the reality of the fact, that it would only be necessary\r\nto read with attention the 26th article of the quoted royal decree\r\nof creation, in order more correctly to comprehend the origin and\r\nconstitutive system of this political body.\r\n\r\n\"The latter,\" says the Duke de Almodovar, \"is reduced to two principal\r\npoints: the first of which is the carrying of the trade of Asia\r\nwith that of America and Europe; and the second, the encouragement\r\nand improvement of the productions and manufacturing industry of\r\nthe Islands. The one is the essential attribute of the company,\r\nconstituting its real character of a mercantile society; and, in the\r\nother respect, it becomes an auxiliary of the government, to whom\r\nthe duties alluded to more immediately belong.\" If to the above we\r\nadd the preamble of the 43rd article of the new decree of 1803, the\r\nrecommendation, made to the company, to contribute to the prosperity\r\nof the agriculture and manufacturing industry of the Islands, will\r\nappear as a limited and secondary consideration; for even if the\r\nquestion were carried to extremes, it could never extend to any more\r\nthan the application of four per cent of the annual profits of the\r\ncompany indistinctly to both branches. If, however, any doubts still\r\nremained, the explanation or solution recently given to this question\r\nwould certainly remove them; because, by the simple fact of its being\r\nexpressed in the latter part of the aforesaid 43rd article, [Profit\r\npercent to go to Spain.] \"That the above-mentioned four per cent was to\r\nbe laid out, with the king's approbation, in behalf of the agriculture\r\nand manufacturing industry of Spain and the Philippine Islands,\" it is\r\nclear that the king reserves and appropriates to himself the investment\r\nof the amount to be deducted from the general dividends, in order to\r\napply it where and how may be deemed most advisable. Consequently,\r\nfar from considering the company in that respect under an obligation to\r\ncontribute to the improvement of the Philippines exclusively, the only\r\nthing that can be required of them, when their charter is withdrawn,\r\nis, the repayment to the royal treasury of the four per cent on their\r\nprofits, for a purpose so vaguely defined. In following up this same\r\ntrain of argument, it would seem that, in order to render the amount\r\nto be deducted from the eventual profits of the company, in the course\r\nof time, a productive capital in the hands of the sovereign, the funds\r\nof the society not only ought not to be diverted to the continuation\r\nof projects which consume them, but, on the contrary, it is necessary\r\nto place at their disposal the direct means by which these funds can\r\nbe increased, in order to make up to the company in some measure the\r\nenormous losses experienced of late years, and at once free their\r\ncommerce from the shackles with which it has hitherto been obstructed.\r\n\r\n[Need of special privileges] Finally, after twenty-four years of\r\nimpotent and gratuitous efforts in the Philippines, and of the most\r\nobstinate opposition on the part of their rivals, it is now time for\r\nthe company, by giving up the ungrateful struggle, to reform in every\r\nrespect their expensive establishment in Manila, and to direct their\r\nprincipal endeavors to carry into effect the project so imperfectly\r\ntraced out in the new decree of 1803. The opinion of the most vehement\r\nenemies of the privileged bodies tacitly approves this exception in\r\ntheir favor. Adam Smith, avowedly hostile to all monopolies, feels\r\nhimself compelled to confess that, \"without the incentives which\r\nexclusive companies offer to the individuals of a nation carrying\r\non little trade, possibly their confined capitals would cease to be\r\ndestined to the remote and uncertain enterprises which constitute a\r\ncommerce with the East Indies.\"\r\n\r\n[Spanish commerce in its infancy.] Our commerce, compared with that\r\nof other nations, notwithstanding what may be said on this subject,\r\nis most assuredly yet in a state of infancy. That with Asia, more\r\nespecially, with the exception of the Royal Company, is almost unknown\r\nto all other classes. If it is, therefore, wished to exclude our many\r\nrivals from so lucrative a branch of trade as that which constitutes\r\nsupplies for the consumption of the Peninsula and its dependencies, the\r\nmeans are obvious. The most material fact is in fact already done. The\r\nnavigation to the various ports of Asia is familiar to the company's\r\nnavy; their factors and clerks have acquired a practical knowledge of\r\nthat species of trade, essential to the undertaking, as well as such\r\ninformation as was at first unknown; but, after the great misfortune\r\nthis body has experienced, it will be indispensably necessary to aid\r\nand invigorate them with large supplies of money, following the example\r\nof other governments in similar cases; in order that the successful\r\nissue of their future operations may compensate their past losses,\r\nand worthily correspond with the magnitude of the object.\r\n\r\n[Philippines a burden to Spain.] This Asiatic colony, although\r\nconsidered as conferring great lustre on the crown and name of our\r\nmonarch, by exhibiting the vast extent of the limits of his dominions,\r\nhas in reality been, during a long series of years, a true burden\r\nto the government, or at least, a possession whose chief advantages\r\nhave redounded in favor of other powers, rivals of our maritime\r\nimportance. Notwithstanding all that has been said on the score of\r\nreal utility, certain it is, that the Philippine establishment has\r\ncost the treasury large sums of money; although, within the last\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years, it must be confessed that the public\r\nrevenues has experienced a considerable increase, and, of itself,\r\nhas become an object of some consequence to the state.\r\n\r\n[Profit from tobacco monopoly and foreign trade.] Among the various\r\ncauses which have contributed to produce so favorable an alteration,\r\nthe chief one have been the establishment of the tobacco monopoly,\r\non behalf of the crown, and the opening of the port of Manila to the\r\nflag of other nations, at peace with Spain. The first has considerably\r\nincreased the entries into the public treasury, and the second\r\nhas tended to multiply the general mass of mercantile operations,\r\nindependent of the other beneficial effects this last measure must\r\nhave produced in a country, whose resources, trade and consumption\r\nhad, from the time of the conquest, experienced the fatal shackles\r\nimposed by jealousy and ignorance.\r\n\r\n[Improvement in public finances.] The improved aspect the colony\r\nsoon assumed, by the introduction of this new system, as was natural,\r\nawakened the attention of ministers, and induced them more easily to\r\nconsent to the measures subsequently proposed to them, principally\r\nintended to place those distant dominions on a footing of permanent\r\nsecurity, so as to enable them to repel any fresh attempts on the part\r\nof an enemy. As, however, the productions of the country increased,\r\nthe public expenses also became greater, although always in a much\r\nsmaller proportion, with the exception of the interval between the\r\nyears 1797 and 1802, when the government, fearful of a second invasion,\r\nwas compelled, at its own expense, to provide against the danger with\r\nwhich these Islands were then threatened. If, therefore, as appears\r\nfrom the official reports of the treasurer-general, Larzabal, in my\r\npossession, the receipts at the treasury, in 1780, amounted only to\r\n$700,000 including the situado, or annual allowance for the expenses\r\nof government sent from New Spain, and after the ordinary charges of\r\nadministration had been paid, a surplus of $170,000 remained in the\r\nhands of the treasurer; at present we have the satisfaction to find\r\nthat the revenue is equal to $2,625,176.50 and the expenses do not\r\nexceed $2,179,731.87 by which means an annual surplus of $445,444.62\r\nis left, applicable to the payment of the debt contracted during the\r\nextraordinary period above mentioned, now reduced to about $900,000 and\r\nafterwards transferable to the general funds belonging to the crown.\r\n\r\n[Economy over Spanish-American colonial administration.] With regard\r\nto the administrative system, it is in every respect similar to the\r\none observed in our governments of America, with this difference only,\r\nthat, in the Philippine Islands, greater economy prevails in salaries,\r\nas well as in the number of persons employed. In former times, the\r\nestablishment of intendencies, or boards of administration, was deemed\r\nexpedient in Manila, Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo, and Cebu; but they\r\nwere soon afterwards reformed, or rather laid aside, on account of\r\ntheir being deemed superfluous. I would venture to state the grounds\r\non which this opinion was then formed; but, as the sphere in which\r\nthe king's revenue acts in these Islands increases and extends, which\r\nnaturally will be the case if the plans and improvements dictated\r\nby the present favorable circumstances are carried into effect, I do\r\nnot hesitate to say that it will be necessary again to appeal to the\r\nestablishment of a greater number of boards for the management and\r\ncollection of the various branches of the revenue, whether they are\r\ncalled intendencies, or by any other name; as it will be extremely\r\ndifficult for the administration to do its duty, on the confined and\r\ninadequate plan under which it is at present organized.\r\n\r\n[Fiscal system.] Under its existing form, it is constituted in the\r\nfollowing manner: The governor of the Islands, in his quality of\r\nsuperintendent or administrator general, and as uniting in himself\r\nthe powers of intendent of the army, presides at the board of\r\nadministration of the king's revenue, which is placed in the immediate\r\ncharge of a treasurer and two clerks. The principal branches have their\r\nrespective general directors, on whom the provincial administrators\r\ndepend, and the civil magistrates, in the quality of sub-delegates,\r\ncollect within their respective districts, the tributes paid by the\r\nnatives in money and produce, and manage everything else relating\r\nto the king's revenue. In ordinary cases, the general laws of the\r\nIndies govern, and especially are the ordinances or regulations of\r\nthe Intendents of New Spain (Mexico) ordered to be observed in the\r\nPhilippines. It ought further to be observed, that, in these Islands,\r\nthe same as in all the vice-royalties and governments of America, there\r\nis a distinct body of royal decrees in force, which, in themselves,\r\nconstitute a code of considerable size.\r\n\r\n[Opposition to tobacco monopoly.] The process of converting the\r\nconsumption of tobacco into a monopoly met with a most obstinate\r\nresistance on the part of the inhabitants, and the greatest\r\ncircumspection and constancy were necessary for the governor, Don\r\nJosé Basco, to carry this arduous enterprise into effect. Accustomed\r\nto the cultivation of this plant without any restriction whatever,\r\nand habituated to its use from their infancy, it appeared to the people\r\nthe extreme of rashness to seek simultaneously to extirpate it from the\r\nface of the greatest part of the Island of Luzon, in order to confine\r\nits culture within the narrow limits of a particular district. They\r\nwere equally revolted at the idea of giving to a common article a\r\nhigh and arbitrary value, when, besides, it had become one of the\r\nfirst necessity. Every circumstance, however, being dispassionately\r\nconsidered, and the principle once admitted that it was expedient for\r\nthe colony to maintain itself by means the least burdensome to the\r\ninhabitants, it certainly must be acknowledged that, although odious\r\non account of its novelty and defective in the mode of its execution,\r\na resource more productive and at the same time less injurious, could\r\nnot have been devised. Hence was it that the partisans of the opposite\r\nsystem were strangely misled, by founding their calculation on false\r\ndata, when they alleged that a substitute, equivalent to the increased\r\nrevenue supposed to arise out of the monopoly of tobacco, might have\r\nbeen resorted to by ordering a proportionate rise in the branch of\r\ntributes. In fact, no one who had the least experience in matters of\r\nthis kind, can be ignorant of the open repugnance the natives have\r\nalways evinced to the payment of the ordinary head-tax (cedula),\r\nand the broils to which its collection has given rise. Besides,\r\nif well examined, no theory is more defective and more oppressive\r\non account of the disparity with which it operates, than this same\r\nwrongly-boasted impost; for, however desirous it may be to simplify\r\nthe method of collecting the general revenue of a state, if the best\r\nplan is to be adopted, that is, if public burdens are to be rendered\r\nthe least obnoxious, it is necessary preferably to embrace the system\r\nof indirect contribution, in which class, to a certain degree, the\r\nmonopoly of all those articles may be considered as included which are\r\nnot rigorously of the first necessity, and only compel the individual\r\nto contribute when his own will induce him to become a consumer.\r\n\r\n[Doubling of insular revenue thru tobacco.] Let this be as it may,\r\ncertain it is, that to Governor Basco we are indebted for having\r\ndoubled the annual amount of the revenue of these Islands, by merely\r\nrendering the consumption of tobacco subservient to the wants of the\r\ncrown. It was he who placed these Islands in the comfortable situation\r\nof being able to subsist without being dependent on external supplies\r\nof money to meet the exigencies of government. It ought, however, to\r\nbe remarked that, although they have been in the habit of receiving\r\nthe annual allowance of $250,000 for which a standing credit was\r\nopened by the government at home on the general treasury of New\r\nSpain, considerable sums have, nevertheless, on various occasions,\r\nbeen remitted from the Philippines to Spain, through the channel of\r\nthe Captain-General. * * * If these remittances have been suspended\r\nfor some years past, it has evidently been owing to the imperious\r\nnecessity of applying the ordinary proceeds of the revenue, as well\r\nas other extraordinary means, to unforeseen contingencies arising\r\nout of peculiar circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Tobacco belt.] The planting and cultivation of tobacco are now\r\nconfined to the district of Gapan, in Pampanga Province, to that of\r\nCagayan, and to the small Island of Marinduque. The amount of the\r\ncrops raised in the above three points and sold to the king, may,\r\non an average, be estimated at fifty thousand bales, grown in the\r\nfollowing proportion: Gapan, forty-seven thousand bales; Cagayan,\r\ntwo thousand, and Marinduque, one thousand. This stock, resold at the\r\nmonopoly prices, yields a sum equal to about one million of dollars,\r\nand deducting therefrom the prime cost and all other expenses,\r\nlegally chargeable on this branch, the net proceeds in favor of the\r\nrevenue amount to $550,000 or upwards of one hundred twenty-two per\r\ncent. This profit is so much more secure, as it rests on the positive\r\nfact that, however great the quantity of the article sold furtively and\r\nby evading the vigilance of the guards, as the demand and consumption\r\nare excessive and always exceed the stock on hand, a ready sale cannot\r\nfail to be had for all the stock placed in the hands of the agents\r\nof the monopoly. From this it may also be inferred how much the net\r\nproceeds of this branch would be increased, if without venturing too\r\nfar in extending the plantations and consequent purchases, care was\r\ntaken to render the supplies more proportionate to the consumption;\r\nfor, by a clear profit of one hundred twenty-two per cent, falling\r\non a larger capital, it follows that a corresponding result would\r\nbe obtained. In a word, the sales, far from declining or being in\r\nany way deemed precarious, are susceptible of a great increase,\r\nconsequently this branch of revenue merits the serious attention of\r\ngovernment beyond all others.\r\n\r\n[Defective sales system.] It is, however, to be lamented that,\r\ninstead of every facility being given to the sale of tobacco and the\r\nconsumption thus encouraged, the public meet with great difficulties\r\nand experience such frequent obstacles and deficiencies in the\r\nsupplies, that with truth it may also be said, the sales are affected\r\nin spite of the administrators themselves. In the capital alone it\r\nis a generally received opinion that a third part more would there\r\nbe consumed, if, instead of compelling the purchaser to receive the\r\ntobacco already manufactured or folded, he was allowed to take it from\r\nthe stores in its primitive state; and if the minor establishments\r\nin the provinces were constantly supplied with good qualities, an\r\ninfinitely larger quantity might be sold, and by this means a great\r\ndeal of smuggling also prevented. Such, however, is the neglect and\r\nirregularity in this department, that it frequently happens in towns\r\nsomewhat distant from Manila, no other tobacco is to be met with\r\nthan what the smugglers sell, and if, perchance, any is to be found\r\nin the monopoly stores, it is usually of the worst quality that can\r\nbe imagined.\r\n\r\n[Loss from preventable causes.] I pass over, in silence, the other\r\ndefects gradually introduced, as evils, in a greater or lesser degree,\r\ninseparable from this part of public administration in every country\r\nin which it has been deemed necessary to establish monopolies; but I\r\ncannot refrain from again insisting on the urgency with which those\r\nin power ought to devote themselves, firmly and diligently, to the\r\ndestruction of abuses which have hitherto paralyzed the progress of\r\nthe branch in question, because I am well persuaded, that, whenever\r\ncorresponding means are adopted, it will be possible in a short\r\ntime to double the proceeds. What these means are, it is not easy,\r\nnor indeed essential, to particularize in a rapid sketch, like this,\r\nof the leading features and present state of the Philippine Islands. I\r\nshall, therefore, merely remark, that it will be in vain to wish the\r\npersons engaged in the management of this department to exert their\r\nreal zeal and sincerely co-operate in the views of government, as\r\nlong as they are not placed beyond the necessity of following other\r\npursuits and gaining a livelihood in another way; in a word, unless\r\nthey have a salary assigned them, corresponding to the confidence and\r\nvalue of the important object entrusted to their charge, no plan of\r\nreform can be rendered efficient.\r\n\r\n[Abuses by revenue officers.] At the same time steps are taken to\r\naugment the revenue arising out of tobacco, it would be desirable,\r\nas much as possible, to improve the methods used with regard to those\r\nwho gather in the crops, by endeavoring to relieve them from the heavy\r\nconditions imposed upon them; conditions which, besides exposing them\r\nto the odious effects of revenue-laws, by their very nature bring upon\r\nthem many unpleasant consequences, and often total ruin. In order that\r\na correct opinion may be formed of these defects, it will suffice to\r\nobserve that, under pretext of preventing smuggling, the guards and\r\ntheir agents watch, visit, and, if I may use the expression, live\r\namong the plantations from the moment the tobacco-seedlings appear\r\nabove ground, till the crops are gathered in. After compelling the\r\nFilipino planter to cut off the head of the stem, in order that the\r\nplant may not become too luxurious, the surveyors then proceed to\r\nset down, not only the number of plants cultivated on each estate,\r\nbut even the very leaves of each, distinguishing their six qualities,\r\nin order to call the farmers to account, respectively, when they\r\nmake a defective delivery into the general stores. In the latter\r\ncase, they are compelled to prove the death of the plants and even\r\nto account for the leaves missing when counted over again, under the\r\npenalty of being exposed to the rigor of the revenue laws.\r\n\r\n[Burdensome and unprofitable inspection.] It cannot indeed be denied\r\nthat by this means two important objects are attained, at one and the\r\nsame time; the one, the gradual improvement of the tobacco, and the\r\nother, the greater difficulty of secreting the article; but, on the\r\nother hand, how great are the inconveniences incurred? Independent of\r\nthe singularity and consequent oppression of a regulation of this kind,\r\nas well as its too great minuteness and complication, it is attended\r\nwith very considerable expenses, and renders it necessary to keep on\r\nfoot a whole army of guards and clerks, who tyrannize over and harass\r\nthe people without any real motive for such great scrupulosity and\r\nprofusion. I make this observation because I cannot help thinking\r\nthat the same results might nearly be obtained, by adopting a more\r\nsimple and better regulated system. I am not exactly aware of the one\r\nfollowed in the Island of Cuba, but as far as I understand the matter,\r\nit is simply reduced to this: the growers there merely present their\r\nbales to the inspectors, and if pronounced to be sound and good, the\r\nstipulated amount is paid over to them; but if the quality is bad,\r\nthe whole is invariably burnt. Thus all sales detrimental to the\r\npublic revenue are prevented, and I do not see why the same steps\r\ncould not be taken in the Philippine Islands. It must not, however,\r\nbe understood, that I presume to speak in a decisive tone on a subject\r\nso extremely delicate, and that requires great practical information,\r\nwhich, I readily acknowledge, I do not possess. I merely wish by means\r\nof these slight hints, to contribute to the commencement of a reform\r\nin abuses, and to promote the adoption of a plan that may have for\r\nbasis the relief of the growers, and at the same time advance the\r\nprosperity of this part of the royal revenue.\r\n\r\n[Coco and nipa wine monopoly.] The monopoly of coco and nipa, or\r\npalm-wine, is a branch of public revenue of sufficient magnitude to\r\nmerit the second place among the resources rendered available to\r\nthe expenditure of these Islands, converted into a monopoly some\r\nyears ago. In like manner as the consumption of tobacco, it has\r\nexperienced several changes in its plan of administration, this\r\nbeing at one time carried on, for account of the king, at others,\r\nby the privilege being let out at auction; till at length the Board\r\nof Control, convinced of the great profit gained by the contractors,\r\nresolved at once to take the direction of this departure under their\r\nown charge, and make arrangement for its better administration. Having\r\nwith this view established general deposits and licensed houses for\r\nthe sale of native wine, with proper superintending clerks they soon\r\nbegan to reap the fruits of so judicious a determination. In 1780,\r\nthe privilege of selling the coco and nipa wine was farmed out, to the\r\nhighest bidder, for no more than $45,200 and subsequently the increase\r\nhas been so great, owing to the improvements adopted, that at present\r\nnet proceeds equal to $200,000 on an average may be relied upon. In\r\nproof of this, the proceeds of this branch, in the year 1809, may be\r\nquoted, when the total balances received at the Treasury, after all\r\nexpenses had been paid, amounted to $221,426, in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\r\nAdministration of Manila and district $201,250\r\nAdministration of La Pampanga and district 12,294\r\nAdministration of Pangasinan and district 7,882\r\n ----\r\n $221,426\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prime cost and other expenses that year amounted to no more than\r\n$168,557 by which means, on the whole operation, a net profit of\r\nthirteen and one-half per cent. resulted in favor of the treasury.\r\n\r\n[Wine monopoly district.] The monopoly of native wine comprehends\r\nthe whole of the Island of Luzon, excepting the Provinces of Cagayan,\r\nZambales, Nueva Ecija, Camarines and Albay, and is under the direction\r\nof three administrators, who act independently of each other in their\r\nrespective districts, and have at their disposal a competent number\r\nof guards. These administrators receive in the licensed establishments\r\nthe coco and nipa wines, at prices stipulated by the growers. That of\r\nthe coco is paid for at the rate of two dollars per jar, containing\r\ntwenty gantas, equal to twelve arrobas, seven azumbres and half a\r\ncuartillo, Castilian measure, and at fourteen reals in the places\r\nnearest the depots. The nipa wine is laid at six and one-half reals\r\nthe jar, indistinctly; prices which, although extremely low, are still\r\nconsidered advantageous by the Filipinos themselves, more particularly\r\nwhen it is besides understood, that, from the circumstance of their\r\nbeing growers of this article, they are exempted from military service,\r\nas well as several other taxes and public charges.\r\n\r\n[Coco-wine.] The coco-wine is a weak spirit, obtained in the following\r\nmanner: The tree that produces this fruit is crowned by an assemblage\r\nof large flowers or corollas, from the center or calix of which issues\r\na fleshy stem, filled with juice. The Indian cuts the extremity of\r\nthis stem, and inclining the remainder in a lateral manner, introduces\r\nit into a large hollow tube which remains suspended, and is found\r\nfull of sweet and sticky liquor, which the tree in this manner yields\r\ntwice in every twenty-four hours. [\"Tuba\".] This liquid, called tuba,\r\nin the language of the country, is allowed to ferment for eight days\r\nin a large vessel, and afterwards distilled by the Indians in their\r\nuncouth stills, which are no other than large boilers, with a head\r\nmade of lead or tin, rendered tight by means of clay, and with a\r\npipe frequently made out of a simple cane, which conveys the spirit\r\nto the receiving vessels, without passing, like the serpentine tube\r\nused in ordinary stills, through the cooling vats, which so greatly\r\ntends to correct the vices of a too quick evaporation. The tuba,\r\nobtained in level and hot situations, is much more spirituous than\r\nthat produced in cold and shady places. In the first, six jars of\r\njuice are sufficient to yield one of spirit, and in the latter,\r\nas many as eight are requisite; a much greater number, however,\r\nwould be wanted to rectify this spirit so as to render it equal to\r\nwhat is usually known by Hollands proof. I am not positively certain\r\nwhat degree of strength the coco-brandy, or as it is usually called\r\ncoco-wine, possesses, but it is evidently inferior to the weakest made\r\nin Spain from the juice of the grape. The only circumstance required\r\nfor it to be approved of, and received into the monopoly-stores,\r\nis its being easily ignited by the application of a lighted candle.\r\n\r\n[Nipa brandy.] The nipa is a small tree of the class of palms, which\r\ngrows in a very bushy form, and multiplies and prospers greatly on\r\nthe margins of rivers and watery tracts of land. The tuba, or juice,\r\nis extracted from the tree whilst in its flowering state, in the same\r\nway as that of the coco, and afterwards distilled by a similar process;\r\nbut it is more spirituous, from six to six and a half jars being\r\nsufficient to yield one of wine. The great difference remarked in the\r\nprices of these two species of liquor, arises out of the great number\r\nof uses to which the fruit of the cocal or coco tree is applicable,\r\nand the increase of expense and labor requisite to obtain the juice,\r\nowing to the great height of the plant, and the frequent dangers to\r\nwhich the caritones, or gatherers, are exposed in passing from one\r\ntree to another, which they do by sliding along a simple cane (bamboo).\r\n\r\n[Little drunkenness.] The impost on, or rather monopoly of, native\r\nwine, is in itself little burdensome to the community, as it only\r\nfalls on the lower and most dissipated orders in society, and for this\r\nreason it is not susceptible of the same increase as that of tobacco,\r\nof which the use is more general, and now become an object of the\r\nfirst necessity. The native of the Philippine Islands is, by nature,\r\nso sober, that the spectacle of a drunken man is seldom noticed in\r\nthe streets; in the capital, where the most corrupt classes of them\r\nreside, it is admirable to see the general abstinence from a vice\r\nthat degrades the human species. The consumption of the coco and\r\nnipa wine is, nevertheless, considerable, for it is used in all their\r\nfestivities, cock-fights, games, marriages, etc. Accordingly if it is\r\ndesired to augment the annual sale of these liquors, no way could be\r\nmore efficient than to increase the number of their festive meetings,\r\nand seek pretexts to encourage public diversions, so long as these do\r\nnot go contrary to the well-regulated order of society, and conflict\r\nwith the duties of those who are intrusted with its superintendence.\r\n\r\n[Extension of monopoly urged.] I am still of opinion, however, that,\r\nwithout resting the prosperity of this branch of the public revenue on\r\nprinciples possessed of so immoral a tendency, it might be rendered\r\nmore productive to the treasury, if the monopoly could be introduced\r\ninto the other districts adapted to its establishment. By this I\r\nmean to say that, as hitherto the monopoly has been partial, and\r\nenforced more in the way of a trial than in a general and permanent\r\nmanner, much remains to be done, and consequently great scope is\r\nleft for improvement in this department of the public revenue. This\r\nmost assuredly may be attained, if all the local circumstances and\r\nimpediments, more or less superable, which the matter itself presents,\r\nare only taken into due account, and proper exertions made to study\r\nand discover the various indirect means of increasing the total mass\r\nof contributions, by applying a system more productive and analogous\r\nto the nature of the Philippine Islands. With regard to the revenue of\r\nthe two particular articles above treated on, I merely wish to make\r\nit understood that, far from introducing by means of the monopoly,\r\na new vice into the provinces in which I recommend its establishment,\r\nit would rather act, in a certain degree at least, as a corrective\r\nto pre-existing evils, and the government would derive advantages\r\nfrom an article of luxury, by subjecting its consumption to the\r\nsame shackles under which it stands in the northern provinces, where\r\nits administration is established and carried on for account of the\r\nroyal treasury.\r\n\r\n[Former customs usage.] In former times, when only vessels belonging to\r\nthe Asiatic nations visited the port of Manila, with effects from the\r\ncoast of Coromandel, or the China junks, and now and then a Spanish\r\nvessel coming from or going to the Island of Java, with spices for\r\naccount of Philippine merchants, the receipt of duties was left in\r\ncharge of a single royal officer, and the valuations of merchandise\r\nmade by him, in concert with two merchants named by the government; but\r\nwith the knowledge and assistance of the king's attorney-general. The\r\nmodifications and changes which have subsequently taken place in this\r\ndepartment have, however, been frequent, as is evidently shown by the\r\nhistorical extract from the proceedings instituted before the Council\r\nof the Indies, by the merchants of Seville and Cadiz, in opposition to\r\nthose of the Philippine Islands, printed in Madrid, 1736, in folio,\r\nby order of the said council; but as it does not enter into my views\r\nto speak of times so remote, I shall confine my remarks to this branch\r\nconsidered under its present form.\r\n\r\n[Custom house.] In conformity to royal orders of March 15 and May 5,\r\n1786, the Royal Custom House of Manila was definitively organized on\r\nits new plan; and from 1788, was placed under the immediate charge\r\nof an administrator-general, a controller, a treasurer, aided by a\r\ncompetent number of guards, inspectors, etc., and in every respect\r\nregulated on the plan established in the other custom houses. The\r\nfreedom of the port being granted to foreign nations, a privilege\r\nbefore enjoyed only by those purely Asiatic, and a new line of trade\r\ncommenced by the company, the competition in merchandise soon began\r\nto increase, as well as the revenue arising therefrom, in such manner\r\nthat, although the exportation of goods was limited to the cargo of\r\nthe Acapulco ship, of which the duties are not payable till her arrival\r\nthere; notwithstanding also the property imported by the company from\r\nChina and India, and destined for their own shipments, was exempt\r\nfrom duties, and above all, the continual interruptions experienced\r\nby the maritime commerce of the Islands within the last fifteen or\r\ntwenty years, the net proceeds of the custom house, from the period\r\nabove mentioned of its establishment, till the close of 1809, have not\r\nbeen less than from $138,000 to $140,000, on an average, independent\r\nof the amount of the king's fifth on the gold of the country, which\r\nis collected by the same administrator, in consequence of its being\r\ntrivial; as well as the two per cent. belonging to the Board of Trade,\r\nand by them collected under that title, and afterwards separately\r\napplied to the average-fund and which usually may be estimated from\r\n$20,000 to $25,000.\r\n\r\nThe general duties now levied in the custom house, are the following:\r\n\r\n[Port charges and duties.] Six per cent. almojarisfago is on all\r\nkinds of merchandise imported in foreign bottoms, under a valuation\r\nmade by the surveyors, in conformity to the respective prices of\r\nthe market at the time on importation; it usually is regulated by\r\nan increase of 50% on the prime cost of India goods, and of 33 1/3%\r\non those from China. This duty may be considered as, in fact, equal\r\nto nine per cent on the former, and eight on the latter.\r\n\r\nSix per cent, or the same duty, on all foreign goods, although imported\r\nin national bottoms.\r\n\r\nThree per cent on Spanish goods, imported under the national flag,\r\nequal, according to the above estimate to 4 and 4 1/2%.\r\n\r\nTwo per cent Board of Trade duty, indistinctly on all foreign property,\r\nequivalent to 2 1/2 or 3%.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five per cent anchorage dues, levied on the total amount of\r\nthe almojarisfago duty.\r\n\r\nAn additional of two and one-half per cent, a new and temporary duty,\r\ncalled subvencion, appropiated to the payment of the loan made to\r\nthe king by the Cadiz Board of Trade, and leviable on all kinds of\r\nimported goods, and, of course, equal, according to the usual mode\r\nof valuation, to about three per cent.\r\n\r\nThree per cent on the exportation of coined silver and gold of the\r\ncountry, in dust and, ingots.\r\n\r\nAn additional or duty of subvencion, or temporary duty on the above,\r\nequal to one-half per cent.\r\n\r\nOne and a half per cent under the same rate, on all kinds of goods,\r\nand equal to two or two and one half per cent.\r\n\r\nOne and one-half per cent on the amount of the cargo of the Acapulco\r\nship, on leaving the port of Manila, equal to 3/4% on the real\r\nprime cost.\r\n\r\n[Slight concession to the Company.] The company are considered in\r\nthe same light as the rest of the merchants, in the graduation and\r\npayment of duties, on such goods as they sell out of their own stores\r\nfor local consumption, to the Company, with the exemption only of\r\nthe Board of Trade rate of 2% and 3%, on the exportation of silver,\r\naccording to a special privilege, and in conformity to the 61st\r\nArticle of the new royal decree of 1803.\r\n\r\nBesides the duties above enumerated, there is another trifling one\r\nestablished for local purposes of peso merchante, being a rate for the\r\nuse of the king's scales, levied according to an extremely equitable\r\ntariff, on certain articles only of solid weight, such as iron, copper,\r\netc. The raw materials as well as all kinds of manufactured articles,\r\nbelonging to the Islands, are exempt from duties on their entry in\r\nthe port and river of Manila; but some of the first are subject to\r\nthe most unjust of all exactions, that is, to an arbitrary tax and\r\nto the obligation of being retailed out on board the vessels in which\r\nthey have been brought down, and deliverable only to persons bearing\r\na written order, signed by the sitting members of the municipal\r\ncorporation. Among this class of articles may be mentioned the coco\r\nof Cebu and the wax and oil of the Bisayas, which are rated as objects\r\nof the first necessity.\r\n\r\n[Undervaluation of galleon goods.] With regard to the respective\r\nduties on the cargo annually dispatched by the merchants of Manila\r\nto New Spain, the practice of galleon is tolerably well regulated. An\r\nextreme latitude is given to the moderate rates at which it is ordered\r\nto value the goods contained in the manifest, by which means these are\r\nfrequently put down at only one-half of their original prime cost;\r\nthe commission to frame the scale of valuations which is to be in\r\nforce for five years, after which time it is renewed, being left\r\nto three merchants, and made subject to the revision of the king's\r\nattorney-general (fiscal) and the approbation of the governor;\r\nconsequently, such being the nature of the tariff on which these\r\noperations are founded, the 33 1/3% to which the royal duties amount\r\non the $500,000 stipulated in the permit, does not, in fact, affect\r\nthe shipper beyond the rate of 15 per cent, in consequence of the\r\ngreat difference between the prime cost and valuation of the articles\r\ncorresponding to the permit; or, what is the same thing, between\r\nthe $500,000 nominal value, and $1,100,000 or $1,200,000, the real\r\namount of the cargo in question. The most remarkable circumstance,\r\nhowever, is, that the officers of the revenue in Acapulco collect\r\nthe above-mentioned 33 1/3% in absolute conformity to the Manila\r\nvaluation, and not according to the value of the goods in America,\r\nand without any other formality than a comparison of the cargo with\r\nthe ship's papers. In honor of truth, it ought to be further observed\r\nthat, although the Manila merchant by this means seeks to exempt\r\nhimself from the part of the enormous duties with which it has been\r\nattempted to paralyze the only commercial intercourse he carries on\r\nwith New Spain, in every other respect connected with this operation,\r\nhe acts in a sufficiently legal manner, and if at their return those\r\nvessels have been in the habit of bringing back near a million of\r\ndollars in a smuggled way, it must be acknowledged that it is the\r\nharshness of the law which compels the merchant to become a smuggler;\r\nfor according to the strange regulation by which he is thwarted in the\r\nreturns representing the proceeds of his outward operation, he must\r\neither bring the money to the Philippine Islands without having it\r\ndeclared on the ship's papers, or be obliged to leave the greatest\r\npart of it in the hands of others, subject to such contingencies\r\nas happen in trade. As long, therefore, as the present limitations\r\nsubsist, which only authorize returns equal to double the value of\r\nthe outward-bound cargo, this species of contraband will inevitably\r\ncontinue. The governors also, actuated by the principles of reason\r\nand natural justice, will, as they have hitherto done, wink at the\r\ninfraction of the fiscal laws; a forbearance, in fact, indirectly\r\nbeneficial to them, inasmuch as it eventually contributes to the\r\ngeneral improvement of the colony. Indeed, without this species of\r\njudicious condescension, trade would soon stand still for the want\r\nof the necessary funds to carry it on.\r\n\r\n[Unbusinesslike custom ways.] .... It will readily be acknowledged\r\nthat, in like manner as the good organization of custom houses is\r\nfavorable to the progress of general commerce, so nothing is more\r\ninjurious to its growth and the enterprise of merchants, than any\r\nuncertainty or arbitrary conduct in the levying of duties to be\r\npaid by them. This arises out of the circumstance of every merchant,\r\nentering on a new speculation, being anxious to have, as the principal\r\nground work of his combinations, a perfect knowledge of the exact\r\namount of his disbursements, in order to be enabled to calculate the\r\nfinal result with some degree of certainty. Considered in this point\r\nof view, the system adopted in the Islands is certainly deplorable,\r\nsince it must be acknowledged that the principles and common rules of\r\nall other commercial countries, are there unknown. For example; this\r\nyear a cargo arrives from China or Bengal, and the captain turns in\r\nhis manifest. The custom-house surveyors then commence the valuation\r\nof the goods of which his cargo is composed: I say they commence,\r\nbecause it is a common thing for them not to have finished the estimate\r\nof the scale and amount of corresponding duties, till the expiration\r\nof two, four, and not unfrequently six months. The rule they affect to\r\nfollow, in this valuation, is that of the prices current in the market,\r\nand in order to ascertain what these are, they are seen going round\r\ninquiring in the shops of the Sangleys (Chinese), till at length,\r\nfinding it useless to go in search of correct and concurrent data,\r\nin a place where there are neither brokers nor public auctions, they\r\nare forced to determine in an arbitrary manner, and as the adage goes,\r\nalways take good care to see their employers on the right side of the\r\nhedge. The grand work being ended, with all this form and prolixity,\r\nthe sentence of the surveyors is irrevocable. The bondsman of the\r\ncaptain, who, in the meanwhile, has usually sold his cargo and departed\r\nwith a fresh one for another destination, pays in the amount of the\r\nduties, thus regulated by law.\r\n\r\n[Variations in valuations.] The practical defects and injurious\r\nconsequences of such a system as this, it would be unnecessary\r\nto particularize. It would, however, be less intolerable, if,\r\nonce put in force, it could serve the merchant as a guide in the\r\nvaluations of his property for a determined number of successive\r\nyears. What, however, renders this assessment more prejudicial,\r\nis its instability and uncertainty, and the repetition of the same\r\noperation I have just described every year, and with every cargo that\r\narrives; but under distinct valuations, according to the reports\r\nor humor of the day. Besides these great defects and irregularity,\r\nthe Philippine custom house observes the singular practice of not\r\nallowing the temporary landing of goods entered in transitu and for\r\nre-exportation, as is done on the bonding system in all countries\r\nwhere exertions are made by those in authority for the extension and\r\nimprovement of commerce in every possible way. Of course, much less\r\nwill they consent to the drawback or return of any part of the duties\r\non goods entered outwards, even though they are still on board the\r\nvery vessels in which they originally came shipped. Beyond all doubt,\r\nthe wrongly understood severity of such a system, has, and will,\r\ncontinue to prevent many vessels from frequenting the port of Manila,\r\nand trying the market, unable to rely on the same liberal treatment\r\nthey can meet with in other places.\r\n\r\n[The areca-nut.] The bonga, or areca-nut, is the fruit of a very\r\nhigh palm-tree, not unlike the one that bears the date, and the\r\nnuts, similar to the latter, hang in great clusters from below the\r\nprotuberance of the leaves or branches. Its figure and size resemble\r\na common nut, but solid, like the nutmeg. Divided into small pieces,\r\nit is placed in the center of a small ball made of the tender leaves\r\nof the buyo or betel pepper, lightly covered with slacked lime,\r\nand this composition constitutes the celebrated betel of Asia, or,\r\nas it is here called, the buyo, the latter differing from that used\r\nin India, inasmuch only as it contains cardamomom.\r\n\r\n[Buyo monopoly unsatisfactory.] The government, anxious to derive\r\nadvantage in aid and support of the colony, from the great use the\r\ninhabitants make of the buyo, many years ago determined to establish\r\nthe sale of the bonga, its principal ingredient, into a monopoly,\r\neither by hiring the privilege out, or placing it under a plan of\r\nadministration, in the form in which it now stands. Both schemes have\r\nbeen tried, but neither way has this branch been made to yield more\r\nthan $30,000; indeed the annual proceeds usually have not exceeded\r\n$25,000. In 1809, the total amount of sales was $48,610, and deducting\r\nfrom this sum the prime cost and expenses of administration, the net\r\nprofit in favor of the treasury was equal to no more than $27,078 or\r\nupwards of 125 1/2%. In 1780, the privilege of selling the bonga was\r\nlet out at public auction for the sum of $15,765 and this, compared\r\nwith the present proceeds, clearly shows that, although the increase\r\nhas not advanced equally with the other branches of the revenue, it is\r\nfar from having declined. It must nevertheless be confessed, that on\r\nthe present footing on which it stands, the smallness of the proceeds\r\nis not worth the trouble required in the collection, and even if the\r\namount were still greater, it could never serve as an excuse for the\r\noppression and violence to which this monopoly frequently gives rise.\r\n\r\n[Hardships on areca-nut planters.] As the trees producing the bonga\r\nare not confined to any particular grounds, and indiscriminately grow\r\nin all, the plan has been adopted of compelling the Filipinos to gather\r\nand bring in the fruit, raised on their lands, to the depot nearest the\r\ndistrict in which they reside. There they are paid from two, two and\r\none-half, three and three and one-half reals per thousand, according\r\nto the distance from which they come: and, in order to prevent frauds,\r\nthe surveyors belonging to the revenue go out, at certain times of the\r\nyear, to examine the bonga plantations, and the trees being counted,\r\nthey estimate the fruit, that is, oblige the proprietor to undertake\r\nto deliver in two hundred nuts for each bearing tree, whether or not,\r\nhurricanes deteriorate or destroy the produce, or thieves plunder\r\nthe plantations, as very frequently happens. In case deficiencies are\r\nproved against him, he is compelled to pay for them in money, at the\r\nrate of twenty-five reals per thousand, the price at which the king\r\nsells them in the monopoly-stores. Besides, the precise condition of\r\ndelivering in two hundred bonga nuts, according to the stipulations\r\nimposed upon him, presupposes the previous exclusion of all the injured\r\nor green ones; and although the ordinary trees usually yield as many as\r\nthree hundred nuts each, great numbers are nevertheless spoiled. If, to\r\nthe adverse accidents arising out of the storms and robberies, we add\r\nthe effects of the whims or ill-humor of the receivers, it is not easy\r\nto imagine to what a length the injuries extend which befall the man\r\nwho has the folly or misfortune to become a planter of this article.\r\n\r\n[Folly of monopoly plan.] On the other hand, as in the conveyances\r\nfrom the minor to the larger depots, frauds are frequently committed,\r\nand the heaping together of many millions of nuts inevitably produces\r\nthe fermentation and rapid putrefaction of a great number of them,\r\nit consequently follows that the waste must be immense; or if it is\r\ndetermined to sell all the stock laid in, without any distinction in\r\nquality and price, the public must be very badly served and displeased,\r\nas in fact too often happens. Since, therefore, the habit of using\r\nthe buyo is still more prevailing than that of tobacco, when suitable\r\nsupplies cannot be had in the monopoly stores, the consumer naturally\r\nresorts to the contraband channels, although he encounters some risk,\r\nand expends more money. It is also very natural that the desire of\r\ngain should thus lead on and daily expose a number of needy persons,\r\nanxious by this means to support and relieve the wants of their\r\nfamilies. Returning, however, to what more immediately concerns the\r\ngrower, I do not know that the oppressive genius of fiscal laws has,\r\nin any country of the globe, invented one more refinedly tyrannic,\r\nthan to condemn a man, to a certain degree at least, as has hitherto\r\nbeen the case, to the punishment of Tantalus; for the law forbids the\r\nFilipino to touch the fruit of the tree planted with his own hands,\r\nand which hangs in tempting and luxuriant abundance round his humble\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\n[Its modification desirable.] It would be easy for me to enumerate\r\nmany other inconveniences attending this branch of public revenue,\r\non the footing on which it now stands, if what has already been said\r\ndid not suffice to point out the necessity of changing the system,\r\nas those in authority are anxious that the treasury should gain more,\r\nand the king's subjects suffer less. The strong prejudice entertained\r\nagainst this source of revenue, the inconsiderable sum it produces,\r\nand the complicated form of its organization, have in reality been\r\nsufficient motives to induce many to become strenous advocates for\r\nthe total abolition of the monopoly. I do not, however, on this\r\naccount see any reasons for altogether depriving the government of\r\na productive resource, as this might soon be rendered, if it was\r\nplaced under regulations less odious and more simple in themselves. I\r\nnevertheless agree, that the perfect monopoly of the areca fruit, or\r\nbonga, is impracticable, till the trees, indiscriminately planted,\r\nare cut down, and, in the same way as the tobacco plantations,\r\nfresh and definite grounds are laid out for its cultivation, on\r\naccount of the revenue. I am further aware that this measure is\r\nless practicable than the first; for, independent of all the other\r\nobstacles, it would be necessary to wait till the new plantation\r\nyielded fruit, and also that the public should consent to refrain\r\nfrom masticating buyo in the meanwhile, a pretension as mad as it\r\nwould be to require that the eating of salt should be dispensed with\r\nfor a given number of years. But what difficulty would there be,\r\nfor example, in the proprietors paying so much a year for each bonga\r\ntree to the district magistrate, the governor of the nearest town,\r\nor the cabeza de Barangay, or chiefs of the clans into which the\r\nnatives are divided, in the same manner as the Filipino pays his\r\ntribute? [Tree-tax preferable.] The only one I anticipate is that of\r\nfixing the amount in such way that, at the same time this resource is\r\nmade to produce an increased income of some moment, it may act as a\r\nmoderate tax on an indefinite property, the amount of which, augmented\r\nin the same price, may be reimbursed to the proprietor by the great\r\nbody of consumers. It is not in fact easy to foresee or estimate,\r\nby any means of approximation, the alteration in the current price\r\nof the bonga, that would result from the indefinite freedom of its\r\ncultivation and sale, especially during the first years. Although,\r\nfor this reason, it would be impossible to ascertain what proportion\r\nthe impost on the tree would then bear with regard to the value of\r\nthe fruit, the error that might accrue would be of little moment, as\r\nlong as precautions were taken to adopt a very low rate of comparison,\r\nand a proportionably equitable one as the basis of taxation. Supposing\r\nthen that the price of the bonga should decline from twenty-five reals,\r\nat which it is now sold in the monopoly stores, to fifteen reals per\r\nthousand, in the general market, and a tax of one-fourth real should\r\nbe laid on each tree valued at two hundred bonga nuts, it is clear\r\nthat this would be equal to no more than 8 1/2%; or, what is the same,\r\nthe tax would be in the proportion one to twelve with the proceeds of\r\neach tree, and the more the value of the fruit was raised, the more\r\nwould the rate of contribution diminish. It ought at the same time\r\nto be observed that, under the above estimate, that is, supposing the\r\nprice of the article to remain at fifteen reals, the 8 1/2% at which\r\nrate the tax is regulated, would not perhaps exceed five or six per\r\ncent on a more minute calculation; in the first place, because at the\r\ntime of making out the returns of the trees, [Exception of immature\r\nand aged trees.] those only ought to be set down which are in their\r\nfull vigor, excluding such as through the want or excess of age only\r\nyield a small proportion of fruit; and in the second, because in\r\nthe numbers registered, the trees would only be rated at two hundred\r\nalthough it is well known they usually yield three hundred, in order\r\nby this means the better to avoid all motives of complaint. In this\r\npoint of view, and by adopting similar rules of probability, it seems\r\nto me that the government would not risk much by an attempt to change\r\nthe present system into a tax levied on the tree itself, on a plane\r\nsimilar to the one above proposed; more particularly by doing it in\r\na temporary manner, and rendering it completely subservient to the\r\ncorrections subsequent experience might suggest in this particular.\r\n\r\n[Difficulty of estimating probable revenue.] The difficulty being,\r\nin this manner, overcome, with regard to the prudent determination\r\nof the rate at which the proprietor of the bonga plantations ought\r\nto contribute, let us now proceed to estimate, by approximation, the\r\nannual sum that would thus be obtained. As, however, this operation\r\nis unfortunately complicated, and in great measure depends on the\r\nprevious knowledge of the total number of trees liable to the tax\r\nproposed, details with which we are at not present prepared, it is\r\nimpossible to come at any very accurate results. All that can be done\r\nis to endeavor to demonstrate, in general terms, the great increase\r\nthe revenue would experience by the adoption of the new plan, and\r\nthe real advantage resulting from it to the contributors themselves,\r\nall which may be easily deduced from the following calculation.\r\n\r\nLet us, in the first instance, suppose that the consumers of buyo,\r\nin the whole of the Islands, do not exceed one million of persons,\r\nand that each one makes use of three bongas per day, this consumption,\r\nat the end of the year, would then amount to 1,095,000,000 nuts. We\r\nwill next divide this sum by two hundred, at which the product of each\r\ntree, one with another, is rated, and the result will be 5,475,000\r\ntrees. [Greater, however, than at present.] This number being taxed\r\nat the rate of one-fourth real, would leave the sum of $171,093.75\r\nand deducting therefrom the $25,000 yielded by this branch under its\r\npresent establishment, together with $5,132 equal to three per cent\r\npaid to the district magistrates for the charges of collection, we\r\nshould still have an annual increase in favor of the, treasury equal\r\nto $140,961.75.\r\n\r\nIt might perhaps be objected that, in this case, the proprietor,\r\ninstead of receiving, as before two and one-half reals for every\r\nthousand bongas, would have to disburse one and one-fourth reals in\r\nthe mere act of paying one-fourth real for each tree; a circumstance\r\nwhich, at first sight, seems to produce a difference not of one and\r\none-fourth, but of three and one-fourth reals per thousand against\r\nhim; though in reality far from this being the case, if we take into\r\nconsideration the deficiencies the sworn receiver usually lays to\r\nhis charge, the fruit he rejects, owing to its being green or rotten,\r\nand the many and expensive grievances he is exposed to in his capacity\r\nof grower; it will be seen that his disbursements under these heads\r\nfrequently exceed the amount he in fact has to receive. [Tax only a\r\nsurcharge ultimately paid by consumer.] If, in addition to this, we\r\nbear in mind that, on condition of seeing himself free from guards\r\nand a variety of insupportable restrictions, constituting the very\r\nessence of a monopoly, he would in all probability gladly pay much\r\nmore than the tax in question, all the doubts arising on this point\r\nwill entirely disappear. Finally, considered in its true light, we\r\nshall not find in the measure above described anything more than a\r\nvery trifling discount required of the proprietor from the price at\r\nwhich he sells his bonga, and which, as already noticed, ultimately\r\nfalls on the consumer alone.\r\n\r\n[Estimate conservative.] The moderate estimate I have just formed ought\r\nto inspire the more confidence from its being well known that the use\r\nof the buyo is general among the inhabitants of these Islands. The\r\ncalculation, as it now stands, rests only on one million consumers,\r\nfor each of whom I have only put down three bongas per day, whereas\r\nit is customary to use much more; nor have I taken into account the\r\ninfinite number of nuts wasted after being converted into the buyo,\r\na fact equally well known. Indeed, as the object proposed was no\r\nother than to prove the main part of my assertions, and I trust this\r\nis satisfactorily done, I have not deemed it necessary to include\r\nin the above calculation a greater number of minute circumstances,\r\nnor attempt to deduce more favorable results, which, with the scope\r\nbefore me, I was most assuredly warranted in doing.\r\n\r\n[Advantages.] In a word, from the concurrence of the facts and\r\nreasons above adduced, the following propositions may, without any\r\ndifficulty, be laid down. First, that the increase of revenue produced\r\nby the reform in question, would in all probability exceed $150,000\r\nper annum; secondly, that the Filipinos would soon comprehend, and\r\ngladly consent to a change of this kind in the mode of contributing\r\nof which the advantages would be apparent; thirdly, that the persons\r\nemployed in the old establishment, might, with greater public utility,\r\nbe applied to other purposes; and lastly, that the civil magistrates\r\nwould not be harassed with so many strifes and lawsuits, and so many\r\nmelancholy victims of the monopoly, and its officers would cease to\r\ndrag a wretched existence in the prisons and places of hard labor in\r\nthese Islands.\r\n\r\n[Cockpit licenses.] The cock-pit branch of the revenue is hired out\r\nby the government, and the license is separately set up at auction\r\nfor the respective provinces. Its nature and regulations are so\r\nwell known that they do not require a particular description, the\r\ngeneral obligations of the contractors being the same as those in New\r\nSpain. Perhaps the only difference observed in this public exhibition\r\nin the Philippine Islands consists in its greater simplicity, owing to\r\nits being frequented only by the natives, the whites who are present\r\nat this kind of diversion being very few, or indeed none.\r\n\r\n[Inconsiderable income.] The cock-pits are open two days in the week,\r\nand the lessees of them receive half a real from every person who\r\nenters, besides the extra price they charge those who occupy the best\r\nseats, the owners of the fighting cocks, for the spurs, stalls for the\r\nsale of buyo, refreshments, etc. Notwithstanding all this, and although\r\ncock-fighting is so general and favorite an amusement among these people\r\n(the rooster may justly be considered as the distinctive emblem of\r\nthe Filipino) the annual proceeds of this branch are inconsiderable;\r\nalthough it must be acknowledged that it has greatly increased since\r\nthe year 1780, when it appears the license was let at auction for\r\nonly about $14,000 owing, no doubt, to the exclusive privilege of\r\nthe contractors not having been extended to the provinces, as was\r\nafterwards gradually done.\r\n\r\n[Provincial cockpit revenue.] The total sum paid to the government by\r\nthe renters of this branch, according to the auction returns in 1810,\r\namounted to $40,141 in the following order for the provinces:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tondo           $18,501\r\n    Cavite            2,225\r\n    La Laguna         2,005\r\n    Pampanga          3,000\r\n    Bulacan           6,900\r\n    Batangas          2,000\r\n    Pangasinan        1,200\r\n    Bataan            1,050\r\n    Iloilo            1,600\r\n    Ilocos              600\r\n    Tayabas             400\r\n    Cebu                360\r\n    Albay               300\r\n    Total           $40,141\r\n\r\n\r\n[Possibilities of increase.] The causes, to which the increase\r\nthat has taken place within the last twenty-five or thirty years is\r\nchiefly to be attributed, have already been pointed out, and for this\r\nreason it would appear that, by adopting the same plan with regard to\r\nthe fourteen remaining provinces, of which this captaincy-general\r\nis composed, hitherto free from the imposition of this tax, an\r\naugmentation might be expected, proportionate to the population,\r\ntheir circumstances, and the greater or lesser taste for cock-fights\r\nprevailing among their respective inhabitants. At the commencement, no\r\ndoubt, the rentals would be low, and, of course, the prices at which\r\nthe licenses were let out, would be equally so; but the experience\r\nand profits derivable from this kind of enterprises would not fail\r\nsoon to excite the competition of contractors, and in this way add\r\nto the revenue of the government. This is so obvious that I cannot\r\nhelp suspecting attempts have, at some period or other, been made\r\nto introduce the establishment of this privilege, in some of the\r\nprovinces alluded to; at the same time I am persuaded that, owing\r\nto the affair not having been viewed in its proper light, seeking\r\non the contrary to obtain an immediate and disproportionate result,\r\nthe authorities have been too soon disheartened and given up the\r\nproject without a fair trial. All towns and districts murmur, and,\r\nat first object, to taxes, however light they may be; but, at length,\r\nif they be not excessive, the people become reconciled to them. The\r\none here proposed is neither of this character, nor can it be deemed\r\nodious on account of its novelty. The natives are well aware that\r\ntheir brethren in the other provinces are subject to it, and that\r\nin this nothing more is done than rendering the system uniform. I,\r\ntherefore, see no reason why the establishment of this branch of\r\nrevenue should not be extended to all the points of the Islands. At\r\nthe commencement, let it produce what it may, since constancy and\r\ntime will bring things to the same general level.\r\n\r\n[Indian tributes.] The too great condescension and mistaken humanity\r\nof the government on the one hand, and the fraud and selfishness\r\nof the provincial sub-delegates or collectors, on the other, have\r\nconcurred to change a contribution, the most simple, into one of the\r\nmost complicated branches of public administration. The first cause\r\nhas been owing to a too general acquiescence to receive the amount\r\nof tributes in the produce peculiar to each province, instead of\r\nmoney; and the second, because as the above officers are the persons\r\nintrusted with the collection, whenever the sale has held out to\r\nthem any advantage, they have been in the habit of appropriating the\r\nseveral articles to themselves, without allowing any benefit to the\r\ntreasury. If the prospective sales of the produce appear unfavorable,\r\nit is then forwarded on to the king's store in Manila, surcharged with\r\nfreights, exposed to many risks, and the value greatly diminished\r\nby waste and many other causes. No order or regularity being thus\r\nobserved in this respect, and the sale of the produce transmitted to\r\nthe king's stores being regulated by the greater or lesser abundance in\r\nthe general market, and a considerable stock besides left remaining,\r\nfrom one year to another, and eventually spoiled, it is impossible\r\nto form any exact estimate of this branch. If to these complicated\r\nmatters we add the radical vices arising out of the infidelity of the\r\nheads of clans (cabezas de barangay), the difficulty of ascertaining\r\nthe defects of the returns made out by them, the variations annually\r\noccurring in the number of those exempted either through age or other\r\nlegal motives, and above all, the frequently inevitable tardiness with\r\nwhich the district magistrates send in their respective accounts,\r\nit will be readily acknowledged, that no department requires more\r\nzeal in its administration, and no one is more susceptible of all\r\nkinds of frauds, or attended with more difficulties.\r\n\r\n[A conservative estimate.] In this state of uncertainty, with regard\r\nto this particular branch, I have guided myself by the last general\r\nreturn of tributes, made out in the accountant-general's office,\r\non the best and most recent data, and calculating indistinctly the\r\nwhole value in money, I have deemed it proper afterwards to make a\r\nmoderate deduction, on account of the differences above stated, and\r\narising out of the collection of the tributes in kind, the expenses of\r\nconveyance, shipwrecks, averages, and other causes already enumerated.\r\n\r\n[Fixed charges.] In conformity to this calculation, the total\r\nproceeds of this branch of revenue amount to $505,215 from which\r\nsum are deducted, in the primitive stages of the accounts, the\r\namount of ecclesiastical stipends, the pay of the troops under\r\nthe immediate orders of the chief district magistrates in their\r\nquality of war-captains, together with all other extraordinary\r\nexpenses incurred in the provinces by orders of the government, the\r\nremainder being afterwards forwarded to the king's treasury. It ought,\r\nhowever, to be observed, that the above aggregated sum is more or less\r\nliable to deficiencies, according to the greater or lesser degree of\r\npunctuality on the part of the sub-collectors in making up accounts,\r\nand the solidity of their respective sureties; the failure of this\r\nkind experienced by the revenue being so frequent, that, according to\r\nthe returns of the accountant-general, those which occurred between\r\nthe years 1762 and 1809, were no less than $215,765 notwithstanding\r\nthe great precautions at all times taken to prevent such considerable\r\ninjuries, by every means compatible with the precarious tenure of\r\nproperty possessed by both principals and sureties in this country. All\r\nthe above circumstances being therefore taken into due consideration,\r\nand the ordinary and extraordinary discounts made from the total amount\r\nof tributes, the real sum remaining, or the net annual proceeds of\r\nthe above branch, have usually not been rated at more than $190,000\r\nand $200,000; a sum respectively extremely small, and which possibly\r\nmight be doubled, without the necessity of recurring to any other\r\nmeasure than a standing order for the collecting of the tributes in\r\nmoney, as by this means the variety of expenses and complications above\r\nenumerated, would be avoided, and the king's revenue no longer exposed\r\nto any other deficiencies than those arising out of the insolvency\r\nof the sub-collectors and their sureties, or casual risks, and the\r\ntrifling charges paid for the conveyance of the money. If in opposition\r\nto this it should be alleged that it would be advisable to except some\r\nof the provinces from this general rule, owing to the advantages the\r\ngovernment might derive from certain tributes being paid in kind,\r\nI do not hesitate to answer that I see no reason whatever why this\r\nshould be done, because, if, for example, any quality of rigging\r\nor sail cloth is annually required, it would be easy to obtain it\r\neither by early contracts, or by laying in the articles at the current\r\nmarket price. Indeed, all supplies which do not rest on this footing,\r\nwould be to defraud the natives of the fruits of his industry, and in\r\nthe final result this would be the same as requiring of him double or\r\ntriple tribute, contrary to the spirit of the law, which unfortunately\r\nis too frequently the case under the existing system.\r\n\r\n[Preferability of tribute in money.] Considering this affair in\r\nanother point of view, it would be easy for me to demonstrate, if it\r\nwere necessary, the mistaken idea that the native is benefited by\r\nreceiving in kind the amount of the tribute he has to pay, at the\r\nlow prices marked in the tariff used as a standard, by showing the\r\nextortions and brokerage, if I may so term it, to which the practice\r\ngives rise on the part of the district collectors. It will, however,\r\nsuffice to call the attention of my readers to the smallness of\r\nthe sum constituting the ordinary tribute, when reduced to money,\r\nin order for them to be convinced that it would be superfluous,\r\nas well as hazardous, to attempt to point out how this branch might\r\nbe rendered more productive to the state and at the same time less\r\nburdensome to the contributors, more particularly when the rate\r\nassessed does not exceed ten reals per year, a sum so small, that\r\ngenerally speaking, no family can be found unable to hoard it up, if\r\nthey have any inclination so to do. The prevailing error, however, in\r\nthis respect, I am confident arises out of a principle very different\r\nfrom the one to which it is usually attributed. The tributary native\r\nis, in fact, disposed to pay the quota assigned to him into the hands\r\nof the chief of his clan, in money, in preference to kind; because,\r\nindependent of the small value at which the articles in kind are\r\nrated in the tariff, he is then exposed to no expenses, as he now is\r\nfor the conveyance of his produce and effects; nor is he liable to so\r\nmany accidents. But as the chief of each clan has to deliver in his\r\nforty or fifty tributes to the head magistrate, who is answerable for\r\nthose of the whole province, it is natural for him to endeavor to make\r\nhis corresponding payments in some equivalent affording him a profit;\r\nat the same time the provincial magistrate, speculating on a larger\r\nscale, on the produce arising out of his jurisdiction, seeks to obtain\r\nfrom the government a profitable commutation in kind for that which\r\nthe original contributor would have preferred paying in money. In\r\norder the better to attain his purpose, he asserts, as a pretext,\r\nthe impossibility of collecting in the tribute under another form,\r\nalleging, moreover, the relief the native derives from this mode,\r\nwhereas, if only duly examined, such a pretence is founded on the\r\navarice, rather than the humanity of the magistrate.\r\n\r\nLeaving to one side the defects attributable to the present mode\r\nof collection, and considering the tribute as it is in itself, the\r\nattentive observer must confess, that in no part of our Indies is\r\nthis more moderate; and, indeed, it is evident that the laws generally\r\nrelating to the natives of these Islands seem to distinguish them with\r\na decided predilection above those of the various sections of America.\r\n\r\n[Items in tribute.] The tribute in its origin was only eight reals\r\nper family; but the necessity of providing for the increased expenses\r\nof the government gave rise to this rate being afterwards raised\r\nto ten. The Sangley mestizos pay double tribute, and the Sangleys\r\ncontribute at the rate of $6 per head. Besides this, all pay a yearly\r\nsum, applicable to the funds belonging to the community, and the above\r\ntwo casts pay three reals more, as a church rate, and under the name\r\nof the Sanctuary, the whole being in the following form:\r\n\r\n\r\nEntire Native Tribute       Tribute of Mestizos     Sangleys\r\n\r\n8 Reals, original tribute   16 Reals.               $6 each.\r\n1 1/2 Reals for expenses\r\nof troops                   3\r\n1/2 Reals to tithes         1\r\n10 Reals, amount of tribute 20 Reals.               $6.75\r\n1 Real, community funds     1\r\n3 Reals, sanctuary rate     3\r\n14 Reals, total annual\r\ndisbursement.               24 Reals.               $6.75\r\n\r\n\r\nThe males commence paying tribute at twenty years of age and\r\nthe females at twenty-five, if before they have not entered the\r\nmatrimonial state, and in both the obligation ceases at the age of\r\nsixty. The chiefs of clans, or cabezas de barangay and their eldest\r\nsons, or in default of children, the person adopted in their stead,\r\nthat is, an entire tribute and a half, are exempt from this tax, as\r\na remuneration for the trouble and responsibility they may have in\r\ncollecting in the forty or fifty tributes, of which their respective\r\nclans are composed. Besides these there are various other classes of\r\nexempted persons, such as the soldiers who have served a certain number\r\nof years, those who have distinguished themselves in any particular\r\nmanner in the improvement of industry or agriculture, and others who\r\nhave received special certificates, on just and equitable grounds. In\r\nsumming up the total number of exempted persons, on an average in\r\nthe whole of the provinces, they will be found in the proportion of\r\nfifty to every thousand entire tributes.\r\n\r\n[Chinese tax.] The head-tax of the Sangleys has usually been\r\nattended with so many difficulties in its collection, owing to the\r\nfacilities with which they absent or secrete themselves, and the\r\nmany stratagems this cunning and artful race employ to elude the\r\nvigilance of the commissioners, that the government has at length\r\nfound itself compelled to let out this branch, as was done in 1809,\r\nwhen it was disposed of in the name of one of them for the moderate\r\nsum of $30,000; notwithstanding it is a generally received opinion,\r\nthat the number of this description of Chinese, constantly residing\r\nin the Islands, is above 7,000, which, at the rate of $6 per head,\r\nwould raise this proportion of the tax as high as $42,000.\r\n\r\n[Community funds.] The Community funds belonging to each town, have,\r\nin conformity to the regulations under which they are administered,\r\na special, or I might say, local application; but collected together\r\ninto one stock, as is now the case, and directly administered by the\r\ngovernment, they produce a more general utility. The head town of\r\nthe province A, for example, requires to rebuild the public prison\r\nor town-hall, and its own private funds are not sufficient to defray\r\nthe expenses of the work in question. In this case, therefore, the\r\ngovernment gives orders for the other dependent towns to make up the\r\ndeficiency by taking their proportions from their respective coffers,\r\nas all have an equal interest in the proposed object being carried\r\ninto effect. The king's officers, in consequence thereof, draw the\r\ncorresponding sums from these funds, the whole of which is under their\r\nimmediate superintendence. And in order that the surplus of this stock\r\nmay not stand still, but obtain every possible increase in a country\r\nwhere the premium for money is excessive, when let out at a maritime\r\nrisk, it is ordered that some part shall be appropriated in this way,\r\nand on the same terms as those observed by the administrators of the\r\ncharity funds belonging to the Misericordia (Charity) establishment,\r\nand the third order of St. Francis, which is another of the great\r\nadvantages of assembling this class of property.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this judicious regulation, and the success with\r\nwhich this measure has hitherto been attended, the Community fund\r\nhas gone on increasing in such a way that, notwithstanding the sums\r\ndrawn from it for the purpose of constructing causeways, bridges,\r\nand other municipal objects, at the commencement of 1810, the stock\r\nin hand amounted to no less than $200,000; and it is natural to\r\nsuppose when the outstanding premiums due shall have been paid in,\r\na considerable augmentation will take place. This branch, although\r\nnot exactly comprehended in those which constitute the revenue of the\r\ngovernment, has so obvious an analogy with that of tributes, that I\r\nhave not deemed it any essential deviation from the order and method\r\nI have hitherto observed in this work, to introduce it in this place,\r\nas in itself it did not deserve to be classed under a distinct head.\r\n\r\n[Tribute burdensome.] Notwithstanding the truth of what has been\r\nsaid with regard to the moderate rate of the tribute imposed on the\r\nnative of the Philippine Islands, it would be extremely desirable if\r\nhe could be altogether exonerated from a charge which he bears with\r\ngreat repugnance, by some other substitute being adopted, indirectly\r\nproducing an equivalent compensation. In the first place, because the\r\njust motives of complaint would cease, caused not only by the tribute,\r\nbut also the manner of its collection; and an end would then be put\r\nto those intrigues and extortions the district magistrates commit,\r\nunder the title of zealous collectors of the king's revenue, and the\r\npower of a multitude of subaltern tyrants, comprehended under the\r\ndenomination of chiefs of native clans (cabezas de barangay) would\r\nthen also fall to the ground; a power which, if now employed for the\r\npurpose of oppressing and trampling on the liberties of inferiors,\r\nmight some day or other be converted into an instrument dangerous\r\nand subversive of our preponderance in the country. In the second\r\nplace, if, among all the civilized nations a head-tax (poll-tax)\r\nis in itself odious, it must incontestably be much more so among\r\nthose whose unlettered state, far from allowing them to know that\r\nthe social order requires a certain class of sacrifices for its\r\nbetter preservation, makes them attribute exactions of this kind\r\nto an abuse of superiority. Hence are they led to consider these\r\nrestraints as the symbols of their own slavery and degradation, as\r\nin fact the natives in these Islands have ample reasons for doing,\r\nwhen the legal exemption of the whites is considered, without any\r\nother apparent reason than the difference in color. Independent of\r\nthis, the substitute above alluded to would be extremely expedient,\r\ninasmuch as it would greatly simplify the plan of administration,\r\nthe accountant's department would be freed from the most painful\r\npart of its labors, and the district magistrates and sub-collectors\r\nwould not so frequently be entangled in their accounts, and exposed\r\nto expensive and interminable lawsuits, as now so often happens.\r\n\r\n[Possible Revenue substitutes.] The difficulty, however, of\r\nfinding out this compensation or substitute is a matter of some\r\nconsideration. On the one hand, if it was attempted to distribute\r\nthe proceeds arising out of the tributes on other branches, such as\r\ntobacco, native wine, bonga, and custom house, it would, at first\r\nsight, appear possible, through the medium of an almost invisible\r\naugmentation in the respective sale prices and in the king's duties,\r\nthat this important object might easily be attained; but, on the\r\nother, it might be apprehended that the additional value put on\r\nthe articles above-mentioned, would produce in their consumption\r\na diminution equal to the difference in prices, in which cases no\r\nadvantage would be gained. The practicability of the operation, in my\r\nopinion, depends on the proportion in which the means of obtaining the\r\narticles in question respectively stand with the probability of their\r\nbeing consumed. I will explain myself. If, for example, the annual\r\nstock of tobacco laid in should be insufficient to meet the wants of\r\nthe consumers, as constantly occurs, it is clear that this article,\r\nwhen monopolized, will bear a small augmentation of price, not only\r\nwithout any inconvenience or risk, but with the moral certainty of\r\nobtaining a positive increase of revenue, the necessary effect of\r\nthe total consumption of the tobacco laid in and sold. But as this\r\ndoes not happen with the branch of native wines, of which the stock\r\nusually exceeds the demand, and as the bonga also is not susceptible\r\nof this improvement, owing to the small place it occupies among the\r\nother resources of the revenue, no other means are left than to add to\r\nthe duties of export on silver, and of import on foreign merchandise,\r\na percentage equivalent to the deficiency not laid on tobacco, unless\r\nit should be deemed more advisable to levy a sumptuary contribution on\r\ncoaches, horses and servants, and especially on all kinds of edifices\r\nand houses built of stone and mortar, situated both within and without\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\n[Objection to tribute-paying.] However this may be, whatever the king\r\nloses in revenue by the abolition of the native tributes, no doubt,\r\ncould be made up by an appeal to other ways and means. It is well-known\r\nthat many of the Indian tribes refuse to become subjects of the crown\r\nand object to enter into general society on account of the odious\r\nidea they have formed of paying tribute; or, as they understand it,\r\nthe obligation of giving something for nothing, notwithstanding those\r\nwho voluntarily submit themselves to our laws, are exempt from tribute,\r\nand this charge falls only on their descendants. But of this they must\r\neither be ignorant, or they regret depriving their posterity of that\r\nindependence in which they themselves have been brought up, and thus\r\ntransmit to them slavery as an inheritance. As soon, therefore, as a\r\ngeneral exemption of this kind, without distinction of casts, should\r\nbe made public, the natives would quit their fastnesses and secluded\r\nplaces, and satisfied with the security offered to them, would be\r\nseen coming down to the plains in search of conveniences of civilized\r\nlife, and all gradually would be reduced to Christianity. Hence\r\nthe increase of productions and their consumption, as well as\r\nthe extension of agriculture, industry and internal commerce. The\r\ndiminution of smuggling tobacco would soon follow, progress would be\r\nmade in the knowledge of the mines and natural riches of the country,\r\nand financially, greater facilities would present themselves in\r\ngradually carrying into effect its entire conquest and civilization.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of such great and extraordinary importance deserve to\r\nbe seriously weighed, and to this valuable department of public\r\nadministration the early attention of those in authority ought to\r\nbe called. Let due inquiries be made, and soon shall we discover\r\nthe substantial benefits which would be derived to the treasury\r\nfrom the adoption of this measure, as popular as it is just, and\r\nalso conformable to the liberal spirit of the times. In support of\r\nthe preceding arguments, it ought further to be observed, that when\r\nall the branches constituting the king's revenue are well organized,\r\nbrought to their most productive state, and the public debt contracted\r\nunder unforeseen exigencies paid off, as long as present circumstances\r\ndo not vary, an annual surplus of revenue, equal to more than $500,000,\r\nwill be left; and as the proceeds of the particular branch of tributes\r\ndo not amount to this sum, it is evident their abolition may take\r\nplace, not only without any derangement or onerous consequences to the\r\nadministration, but even without any deficiency being experienced, or\r\nany necessity to recur to the treasury of New Spain for extraordinary\r\naid. These reasons acquire still greater force when it is remembered\r\nthat, as things now are, all the branches of public revenue are\r\nin a progressively improving condition, and as the whole are still\r\nsusceptible of a much more productive organization, the annual surplus\r\nof receipts will rapidly become greater, and consequently also the\r\nnecessity will diminish of continuing to burden this portion of His\r\nMajesty's dominions with contributions in order to meet the expenses\r\nof their defence and preservation.\r\n\r\nFinally, well convinced of the advantageous results which, in\r\nevery sense, would emanate from the revision and reforms proposed,\r\nI abstain from offering, in support of my arguments, a variety of\r\nother reflections which occur to me, not to be too diffuse on this\r\nsubject; trusting that the hints I have already thrown out will be\r\nmore than sufficient to excite an interest and promote a thorough and\r\nimpartial investigation of concerns, highly important to the future\r\nwelfare and security of this colony.\r\n\r\n[Subaltern branches.] Besides the six preceding branches which\r\nconstitute the chief mass of the public revenue in these islands, there\r\nare several smaller ones of less consideration and amount; some having\r\na direct application to the general expenses of the local government,\r\nand the others, intended as remittances to Spain; a distinction of\r\nlittle import and scarcely deserving of notice, since the object of the\r\npresent sketch is to convey information on a large scale respecting\r\nthe King's revenue in these Islands. As some of them, however, yield\r\nproceeds more regular than the others, I have classed together the\r\nreceipts of the Pope's Bulls, or \"Bulas de Cruzada,\" playing-cards,\r\ntithes, stamps and gunpowder, under the head of Subaltern Branches,\r\nwith regard to the rest, to the general statement already quoted.\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the returns with which I have been favored from\r\nthe public offices, these five branches produced, in the year 1809,\r\n$45,090.75 in the following proportions:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Sales.      Expenses.   Net Proceeds.\r\n    Pope's bulls    $15,360.75  $4,422.25   $10,938.50\r\n    Playing cards    11,539.125    932.625   10,606.50\r\n    Tithes           12,493.00        ----   12,493.00\r\n    Stamps            4,467.50     321.50     4,146.00\r\n    Gunpowder         7,307.625    401.125    6,905.375\r\n                           ----       ----         ----\r\n                    $51,168.125 $6,077.75   $45,090.375\r\n\r\n\r\n[Tithes.] The scanty proceeds of the tithes will naturally appear\r\nremarkable; but it ought to be remembered that, besides the ordinary\r\ntribute, the natives pay half a real under this denomination,\r\nwithout any distinction of person, or any reference whatever to their\r\nrespective means, the total amount of which is already added to the\r\ntributes, and for this reason not repeated in this place. In addition\r\nalso no tithes are levied, except on lands belonging to Spaniards,\r\nchurches, regular clergy, ecclesiastical corporations, etc., and even\r\nthen the articles of rice, wheat, pulse indigo and sugar, are alone\r\nliable. The above branches are all in charge of administrators,\r\nand from this plan it certainly would be advisable to separate\r\nthe tithes and farm them out at public auction, as was proposed\r\nby the king's officers of the treasury, in their report on this,\r\nas well as other points, concerning the revenue, and dated October\r\n24, 1792. From the net proceeds of the gunpowder the expenses of its\r\nmanufacture, confided to the commandant of artillery, ought seemingly\r\nto be deducted; but, as they cannot be ascertained with any degree of\r\ncertainty, and as besides they are comprehended in the general expenses\r\nof that department, a separate deduction may be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n[Disbursements and general expenses.] In order to form a correct idea\r\nof the annual amount of the expenditure incurred by the administration\r\nand defence of the Philippine Islands, it is not necessary in this\r\nplace to distinguish each item, separately; or to enumerate them\r\nwith their respective sums or particular denominations. Some general\r\nobservations on this subject ought, nevertheless, to be made, with a\r\nview to point out the reforms of which this important department of\r\nthe public revenue is susceptible.\r\n\r\nIn the part relating to the interior administration or government,\r\nample room is certainly left for that kind of economy arising out of\r\nthe adoption of a general system, little complicated; but it is besides\r\nindispensably necessary that, at the same time the work is simplifed\r\nand useless hands dismissed, the salaries of those who remain should\r\nbe proportionally increased, in order to stimulate them in the due\r\nperformance of their duties. It might also be found advisable to\r\ncreate a small number of officers of a superior order, who would\r\nbe enabled to co-operate in the collection of the king's revenue,\r\nand the encouragement of agriculture, commerce and navigation,\r\nin their respective departments. The additional charges in this\r\nrespect cannot be of any great consequence; although, in reality,\r\nby the receipts increasing through the impulse of an administrative\r\norder more perfect, and the expenses being always the same, the main\r\nobject, so anxiously sought for in another way, would be thus attained.\r\n\r\n[Defence expenses.] The reverse, however, happens with regard\r\nto the expenses of defence, as I have called them, the better to\r\ndistinguish them from those purely relating to the interior police\r\nor administration. Every sacrifice, most assuredly, ought to appear\r\nsmall, when the object is to preserve a country from falling into the\r\nhands of an enemy, and it ought not to excite surprise, if, during the\r\ncourse of the last fifteen years, several millions of dollars have been\r\nexpended in the Philippines, in order to shield them from so dreadful\r\na misfortune. But the late memorable revolution in the Peninsula has\r\ngiven rise to so great a change in our political relations, and it\r\nis extremely improbable that these Islands will be again exposed to\r\nthe same danger and alarm, that the government may now, without any\r\napparent risk, dispense with a considerable part of the preparations\r\nof defence, at one time deemed indispensably necessary. A colony that\r\nhas no other strong place to garrison than its capital, and on the\r\nloyalty of whose inhabitants there are sufficient motives to rely,\r\nought, in my opinion, to be considered as adequately provided against\r\nall ordinary occurrences in time of peace, with the 4,000 regulars,\r\nmore or less, of all arms, the usual military establishment. In case\r\nany suspicions should arise of an early rupture with the only power\r\nwhose forces can inspire the governors of these Islands with any kind\r\nof apprehensions, means will not be wanting to an active and provident\r\nminister, of giving proper advice, so as to allow sufficient time for\r\nthe assembling of the battalions of provincial militia and all the\r\nother necessary preparations of defence, before the enemy is in an\r\nattitude to effect an invasion of a country so far distant from his\r\nown possessions on the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel. Consequently,\r\nby disbanding the corps of provincial infantry, cavalry and artillery,\r\nwhich continue uselessly to be kept on foot, an annual saving of\r\nfrom $220,000 to $250,000 would take place, an amount too great to\r\nbe expended unless imperiously called for by the evident dread of a\r\npremeditated attack from an hostile quarter.\r\n\r\n[Shipping reform.] The navy is another of the departments in which\r\nreforms may be introduced, of no small moment to the treasury. Of\r\ncourse by the government merely dispensing with the policy of keeping\r\nin readiness two large ships to convey to Acapulco the cargos, for\r\nwhich the Manila merchants enjoy an annual licence, and leaving to\r\nthe latter the full liberty of following up their speculations on\r\ntheir own account and risk, in vessels of their own, individually or\r\nwith joint stock, a saving would result in favor of the crown equal to\r\n$140,000 to $150,000 per annum, and without preventing the receipt in\r\nAcapulco of the customary duties of $160,000 or $166,000 corresponding\r\nto the said licenses. This will evidently be the case, because as\r\nlong as the large disposal of funds of the charitable institutions\r\nare employed in maritime risks, and the private property of others\r\nis besides added to them, the amount of the operations undertaken by\r\nthe merchants of the Philippines to New Spain, when divested of all\r\nrestraint, will always exceed $500,000 per annum. Nor is there now\r\nany further occasion for the government to continue granting this\r\nspecies of gratuitous tutelage to a body of men possessed of ample\r\nmeans to manage their own affairs, and who demand the same degree of\r\nfreedom, and only seek a protection similar to that enjoyed by their\r\nfellow-countrymen in other parts of the king's dominions.\r\n\r\n[Galleon graft.] In case the above reform should be adopted, it might\r\nbe deemed requisite for the government to undertake the payment of some\r\nof the charges under the existing order of things, defrayed out of the\r\nfreights to which the merchandise shipped in the Acapulco traders is\r\nliable; because, calculating the freight at the usual rate of $200 for\r\neach three bales, or the amount of one ticket, out of the one thousand\r\nconstituting the entire cargo, and of which one-half, or $100,000 more\r\nor less, is appropriated to the ecclesiastical chapter, municipality,\r\nofficers of the regular army (excluding captains and the other higher\r\nranks) and the widows of Spaniards, who in this case would be losers,\r\nindependent of the remaining $100,000 or 500 tickets distributed\r\namong the 200 persons having a right to ship to Acapulco, it would, at\r\nfirst sight, appear reasonable for the treasury to indemnify the above\r\ndescription of persons by a compensation equivalent to the privation\r\nthey experience through the new arrangement of the government. But\r\nas the practice of abuses constitutes no law, and what is given\r\nthrough favor is different to that which is required by justice,\r\nthere are no reasons whatever why the treasury should be bound to\r\nsupport the widows of private persons, from the mere circumstance of\r\ntheir deceased husbands having been Spaniards; more particularly if\r\nit is considered that, far from having acquired any special merit\r\nduring their lifetime, most of them voluntarily left their native\r\ncountry for the purpose of increasing their fortunes, and others were\r\nbanished from it, owing to their bad conduct. Neither can it be said\r\nthat the municipality have a legal right, in the case before stated,\r\nto receive any equivalent for the value of their respective annual\r\ntickets, which, when disposed of, usually amount to about $20,000 in\r\nthe first place, because it is well-known that the eleven aldermen's\r\nseats, of which that body is composed, seats which can either be\r\nsold or resigned, originally did not cost as much as $50,000 and\r\nclearly the principal invested is out of all kind of proportion with\r\nthe enormous premium or income claimed. In the second place, although\r\nthe above municipal situations were originally purchased with a view\r\nto obtain some advantages, these formerly were very different to what\r\nthey are at present, when the great increase of shippers to Acapulco,\r\nor in more plain terms, of purchase of tickets competing to obtain\r\nthem, has given to these permits a value more than triple to that\r\nthey possessed thirty years ago.\r\n\r\n[Indemnifying the aldermen.] In order, therefore, to do away with\r\nall motives of doubt and dispute, as well as for many other reasons\r\nof public utility, the best plan, in my opinion, would be, to return\r\nto each alderman his money, and the present municipal constitution\r\nbeing dissolved, the number of members might be reduced to four, with\r\ntheir corresponding registrar, and like the two ordinary \"alcaldes,\"\r\nelected every year without any other reward than the honor of presiding\r\nover and representing their fellow-citizens. Under this supposition,\r\nthe only classes entitled to compensation, strictly speaking,\r\nwould be the ecclesiastical chapter and the subaltern officers,\r\nwhose respective pay and appointment are not in fact sufficient\r\nfor the decency and expenses of their rank in society. Of course it\r\nwould then be necessary to grant them more adequate allowances, but,\r\naccording to reasonable calculations, the sum total annually required\r\nwould not exceed $30,000; consequently, the reform projected with\r\nregard to the Acapulco ships would still eventually produce to the\r\ntreasury a saving of from $60,000 to $70,000 in the first year of\r\nits adoption, and of $110,000 to $120,000 in every succeeding one.\r\n\r\n[The navy.] It is, on the other hand, undeniable that, if the royal\r\nnavy and cruising vessels, or those belonging to the Islands and\r\nunder the immediate orders of the captain-general, were united into\r\none department, and placed under one head, considerable economy\r\nwould ensue, and all motives of discord and emulation be moreover\r\nremoved. Such would be the case if the change was attended with no\r\nother cirumstances than the consequent diminution of commanders,\r\nsubaltern officers, and clerks; but it would be also proper to unite\r\nthe arsenals, and adopt a more general uniformity in the operations and\r\ndependences of this part of the public services. It is equally certain\r\nthat, during peaceful times, the two schooners and sixty gunboats,\r\nconstituting the number of the above-mentioned cruising vessels, would\r\nbe in great measure useless; whilst in case of a rupture, they are not\r\nsufficient to protect the trade of these Islands from the attacks of an\r\nenemy, notwithstanding they now cost the government considerable sums\r\nin repairs, etc., in order to keep them fit for service. The government\r\nought therefore to guard against this waste of public money, without,\r\nhowever, neglecting the defence of the Islands, objects which, in my\r\nopinion, might easily be reconciled. Intelligent persons have judged\r\nthat by reducing the naval forces to two frigates, two schooners,\r\nand about a dozen gunboats, the essential wants of the colony would be\r\nduly answered, in ordinary times; and some of the vessels might then\r\nbe destined to pursue hydrographical labors in the Archipelago, which,\r\nunfortunately, are in a most backward state, whilst others could be\r\nsent on their periodical cruises against the Moros. By this means, at\r\nleast, the navy department would be greatly simplified, and cease to be\r\neternally burdensome to the government. With regard to the superfluous\r\ngunboats, it would be expedient to distribute them gratuitously among\r\nthe marine provinces and Bisayan Islands, on the only condition of\r\ntheir being always kept fit for service; as, in one sense, the great\r\nexpenses of maintaining them would be thus saved by the treasury, and,\r\nanother, the inhabitants of those portions of the coast would be in\r\npossession of means sufficiently powerful to repel the aggressions of\r\nthe Moros, who commit great ravages on their settlements. Finally,\r\nif besides the reforms of which the army and navy are susceptible,\r\nit is considered that the public works, such as prisons, schools,\r\nbridges, and causeways, so expensive in other countries, in the\r\nPhilippines are constructed by the natives on the most reasonable\r\nterms, out of the community funds; that there is no necessity to build\r\nfortifications, and maintain numerous garrisons; that the clergy, to\r\nwhose zeal and powerful influence the preservation of these Islands\r\nis chiefly due, do not cost the treasury annually above $200,000 and\r\nthat the geographical situation of the colony in great measure shields\r\nit from the attacks of external enemies, it will readily be confessed,\r\nthat a wise and firm government might undertake, without the dread of\r\nhaving to encounter any great obstacles, an administrative system,\r\nin a general point of view, infinitely more economical than the one\r\nhitherto followed; might be able to extirpate numerous abuses, and\r\nby calling forth the resources of the country gradually raise it to\r\na flourishing condition, and cause it hereafter to contribute largely\r\nto the other wants of the crown. Hence was it that the distinguished\r\nvoyager, La Pérouse (Chap. 15), contemplating these Islands with a\r\npolitical eye, did not hesitate to affirm \"that a powerful nation,\r\npossessed of no other colonies than the Philippines, that should\r\nsucceed in establishing there a form of government best adapted to\r\ntheir advantageous circumstances, would justly disregard all the\r\nother European establishments in Africa and America.\"\r\n\r\n[Objectionable office-holders.] In our colonies, appointments and\r\ncommand far from being sought as a means to obtain a good reputation,\r\nor as affording opportunities of contributing to public prosperity,\r\nare, it is too well known, only solicited with a view to amass\r\nwealth, and then retire for the purpose of enjoying it. Commercial\r\npursuits being besides attended with so many advantages that those\r\nonly decline following them who are divested of money and friends;\r\nwhilst the situation in the revenue are so few in number, compared\r\nwith the many candidates who solicit them, that they are consequently\r\nwell appointed, it follows that the excess left without occupation,\r\nbesides being considerable, is generally composed of needy persons, and\r\nnot the most suitable to exercise the delicate functions of collectors\r\nand magistrates in the provinces. From this class nevertheless the\r\nhost of officers are usually taken who, under the name of collectors,\r\nsurveyors and assessors of tributes, intervene in, or influence\r\nthe public administration. Owing to the variety and great number of\r\npersons emigrating to America, ample field, no doubt, is there left\r\nfor selection, by which means the viceroys may frequently meet with\r\npersons suitable and adequate to the above trusts, if prudent steps\r\nare only taken; but in this respect the case is very different in the\r\nPhilippines, where chance alone occasionally brings over a European\r\nSpaniard, unemployed or friendless. In these remote Islands, also,\r\nmore than in any other quarter, people seek to live in idleness, and,\r\nas much as possible, without working, or much trouble. As long as\r\nhopes are entertained of doing something in the Acapulco speculations,\r\nevery other pursuit is viewed with indifference, and the office of\r\ndistrict or provincial magistrate is only solicited when all other\r\nresources have failed, or as a remedy against want. As the applicants\r\nfor these situations are therefore not among the most select classes,\r\nit very frequently happens that they fall into extremely improper\r\nand unworthy hands.\r\n\r\nIt is in fact common enough to see a hairdresser or a lackey converted\r\ninto a governor; a sailor or a deserter transformed into a district\r\nmagistrate, collector, or military commander of a populous province,\r\nwithout any other counsellor than his own crude understanding,\r\nor any other guide than his passion. Such a metamorphosis would\r\nexcite laughter in a comedy or farce; but, realized in the theatre\r\nof human life, it must give rise to sensations of a very different\r\nnature. Who is there that does not feel horror-struck, and tremble\r\nfor the innocent, when he sees a being of this kind transferred from\r\nthe yard-arm to the seat of justice, deciding, in the first instance,\r\non the honor, lives, and property of a hundred thousand persons, and\r\nhaughtily exacting the homage and incense of the spiritual ministers\r\nof the towns under his jurisdiction, as well as of the parish curates,\r\nrespectable for their acquirements and benevolence, and who, in their\r\nown native places, would possibly have rejected as a servant the very\r\nman whom in the Philippines they are compelled to court and obey as\r\na sovereign.\r\n\r\nIn vain do the laws ordain that such offices shall not be given away to\r\nattendants on governors and members of the high court of justice, for\r\nunder pretext of the scarcity of Europeans experienced in the colony,\r\nmeans are found to elude the statute, by converting this plea into an\r\nexception in favor of this description of persons. By such important\r\noffices being filled in this manner, it is easy to conceive the various\r\nhardships to which many of the provinces and districts are exposed;\r\nnor can any amelioration be expected as long as this plan is persisted\r\nin and the excesses of the parties go without punishment.\r\n\r\n[Evils from officials in trade.] Independent, however, of the serious\r\ninjuries and great errors persons of the class above described cannot\r\nfail to commit in the exercise of their functions, purely judicial, the\r\nconsequences of their inordinate avarice are still more lamentable,\r\nand the tacit permission to satisfy it, granted to them by the\r\ngovernment under the specious title of a licence to trade. Hence may\r\nit be affirmed, that the first of the evils, and the one the native\r\nimmediately feels, is occasioned by the very person the law has\r\ndestined for his relief and protection. In a word, he experiences\r\ninjuries from the civil magistrates presiding over the provinces,\r\nwho, at the same time, are the natural enemies of the inhabitants,\r\nand the real oppressors of their industry.\r\n\r\nIt is a known and melancholy fact that, far from promoting the\r\nfelicity of the provinces intrusted to their care, the magistrates\r\nattend to nothing else but their own fortunes and personal interests;\r\nnor do they hesitate as to the means by which their object is to\r\nbe attained. Scarcely are they seated in the place of authority,\r\nwhen they become the chief consumers, purchasers, and exporters of\r\nevery thing produced and manufactured within the districts under\r\ntheir command, thus converting their licence to trade into a positive\r\nmonopoly. In all lucrative speculations the magistrate seeks to have\r\nthe largest share; in all his enterprises he calls in the forced aid\r\nof his subjects, and if he deigns to remunerate their labor, at most\r\nit is only on the same terms as if they had been working on account\r\nof the king. These unhappy people bring in their produce and crude\r\nmanufactures to the very person who, directly or indirectly, is to fix\r\nupon them an arbitrary value. To offer such and such a price for the\r\narticles is the same as to say, another bidding shall not be made. To\r\ninsinuate is to command--the native is not allowed to hesitate, he must\r\neither please the magistrate, or submit to his persecutions. Being\r\nbesides free from all competition in the prosecution of his traffic,\r\nsince he is frequently the only Spaniard resident in the province,\r\nthe magistrate therein acts with unbounded sway, without dread,\r\nand almost without risk of his tyranny ever being denounced to the\r\nsuperior tribunals.\r\n\r\n[Speculating in tributes.] In order, however, that a more correct\r\nidea may be formed of the iniquitous conduct of many of these public\r\nfunctionaries, it is necessary to lay open some part of their irregular\r\ndealings in the collection of the Indian tributes. It is well known\r\nthat the government, anxious to conciliate the interests of the\r\ntributary classes with those of the revenue, frequently commutes\r\nthe pecuniary capitation tax into an obligation to pay the amount in\r\nproduce or manufactures. A season comes when, owing to the failure\r\nof the crops, the productions have risen to an excessive price,\r\nand consequently infinitely above the ordinary rates affixed by law,\r\nwhich are generally the lowest, and the natives, unable to keep their\r\nbargains without considerable injury or endangering the subsistence\r\nof their numerous families, implore the favor of the magistrate,\r\npetitioning him to lay their calamitous situation before the superior\r\ngovernment, in order to have the payment of their tribute in kind\r\nremitted, and offering to pay it in money. This is the precise moment\r\nwhen, as his own profits depend on the misery of the province under\r\nhis command, he endeavors to misuse the accidental power with which he\r\nis invested. Hence it happens that, instead of acting as a beneficent\r\nmediator, and supporting the just solicitations of the natives, he at\r\nfirst disregards their petition, and then all at once transforming\r\nhimself into a zealous collector, issues his notifications, sends\r\nhis satellites into the very fields to seize on the produce, and in a\r\nmost inexorable manner insists on collecting till necessity compels\r\nhim to suspend the measure. The principal object being attained,\r\nthat is, having now become master of the gleanings and scanty crops\r\nof his bereft subjects, on a sudden his disposition changes, he is\r\nmoved to pity, and in the most pathetic language describes to the\r\ngovernment the ravages done to the plantations by the hurricanes,\r\nand the utter impossibility of collecting in the tributes that year in\r\nkind. On such a remonstrance he easily obtains permission to change the\r\nstanding order, and proceeding on to collect in some of the remaining\r\ntributes in money, merely to save appearance, with perfect impunity\r\nhe puts the finishing stroke to the wicked act he had commenced, by\r\napplying to himself all the produce his collectors had gathered in,\r\nand places to the credit of the treasury the total amount of the\r\ntributes, corresponding to his jurisdiction, in money.\r\n\r\nSupposing, for example, that this has happened in the province of\r\nAntique, where the payment of the capitation-tax generally takes place\r\nin the unhusked rice, rated at two reals per cavan, and, through the\r\neffects of a bad season, this article should rise as high as ten or\r\ntwelve reals. It is clear that the magistrate, by accounting for the\r\ntributes with the revenue office in money, and collecting them in kind\r\nat the rate fixed by law, would by the sales gain a profit of 400 or\r\n500 per cent; at the same time the native, by the mere circumstance\r\nof then paying in kind, would have paid the tribute corresponding to\r\nfive or six years in a single one, without, on that account, having\r\nfreed himself from the same charge in the following seasons.\r\n\r\n[No check on extortion.] When the extortionate acts as these are\r\npractised, to what lengths may it not be expected the other excesses\r\nand abuses of authority are carried? To the above it ought moreover\r\nto be added, that the provincial magistrates have no lieutenants,\r\nand are unprovided with any other auxiliaries in the administration\r\nof justice, except an accompanying witness and a native director;\r\nthat the scrutinies of their accounts, to which they formerly were\r\nsubject, are now abolished, and, in short, that they have no check\r\nupon them, or indeed any other persons to bear testimony to their\r\nirregularities, except the friendless and miserable victims of their\r\ndespotism and avarice.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, however, what is above stated, it sometimes happens\r\nthat a magistrate is to be met with, distinguished from the rest by\r\nhis prudence and good conduct; but this is a miracle, for by the very\r\ncircumstance of his being allowed to trade, he is placed in a situation\r\nto abuse the wide powers confided to him, and preferably to attend\r\nto his personal interests; in fact, if the principle is in itself\r\ndefective, it must naturally be expected the consequences will be\r\nequally baneful. The lamentable abuses here noticed are but too true,\r\nas well as many others passed over in silence; and the worst of all\r\nis, that there is no hope of remedying them thoroughly, unless the\r\npresent system of interior administration is altogether changed. In\r\nvain would it be to allege the possibility of removing the evil by the\r\ntimely and energetic interposition of the protector of the natives;\r\nfor although this office is in itself highly respectable, it cannot\r\nin any way reach the multitude of excesses committed, and much less\r\nprevent them; not only because the minister who exercises it resides\r\nin the city, where complaints are seldom brought in, unless they come\r\nthrough the channel of the parish curates; but also on account of the\r\ndifficulty of fully establishing the charges against the magistrates,\r\nin the way the natives are at present depressed by fear and threats, as\r\nwell as restrained by the sub-governors and other inferior officers of\r\njustice, who, being dependent upon, and holding their situations from\r\nthe magistrates, are interested in their monopolies and extortionate\r\nacts being kept from public view.\r\n\r\n[Less complaisant laws needed.] If, therefore, it is not possible\r\nentirely to eradicate the vices under which the interior administration\r\nof these Islands labors, owing to the difficulty of finding persons\r\npossessed of the necessary virtues and talents to govern, in an upright\r\nand judicious manner, let us at least prevent the evils out of the\r\ntoo great condescension of our own laws. In the infancy of colonies,\r\nit has been the maxim of all governments to encourage the emigration\r\nand settlement of inhabitants from the mother-country, without paying\r\nmuch attention to the means by which this was to be done. It was not to\r\nbe wondered at that, for reasons of state, defects were overlooked,--at\r\nsuch periods were even deemed necessary. Hence the relaxation in the\r\nlaws in favor of those who, quitting their native land, carried over\r\nwith them to strange countries their property and acquirements. Hence,\r\nno doubt, also are derived the full powers granted to those who took\r\nin charge the subjection and administration of the new provinces,\r\nin order that they might govern, and at the same time carry on their\r\ntraffic with the natives, notwithstanding the manifest incompatibility\r\nof the two occupations; or rather, the certainty that ought to have\r\nbeen foreseen that public duties would generally be postponed, when\r\nplaced in competition with private interests and the anxious desire\r\nof acquiring wealth.\r\n\r\nSubsequently that happened which was, in fact, to be dreaded, viz.,\r\nwhat at first was tolerated as a necessary evil, sanctioned by the\r\nlapse of time has at length become a legitimate right, or rather a\r\ncompensation for the supposed trouble attached to the fulfillment of\r\nthe duties of civil magistrates; whilst they, as already observed,\r\nthink of nothing but themselves, and undergo no other trouble or\r\ninconvenience than usually fall on the lot of any other private\r\nmerchant. In the Philippines, at least, many years having elapsed\r\nsince the natives peaceably submitted to the dominion of the king,\r\nevery motive has ceased that could formerly, and in a certain degree,\r\njustify the indulgence so much abused, at the same time that no\r\nplausible pretext whatever exists for its further continuation.\r\n\r\nAlthough hitherto the number of whites, compared to that of the\r\npeople of color, has not been great, as the whole of the provincial\r\nmagistracies, collectorships, and subaltern governments, do not exceed\r\ntwenty-seven, the scarcity of Spaniards ought not to be alleged as a\r\nsufficient reason; nor can it be doubted these situations might at any\r\ntime be properly filled, if the person on whom the choice should fall\r\nwere only certain of living with decency and in a suitable manner,\r\nwithout being carried away with the flattering hopes of withdrawing\r\nfrom office, with ten, twenty, and even as high as fifty thousand\r\ndollars of property, as has heretofore been the case, but satisfied\r\nwith a due and equivalent salary they might receive as a reward for\r\nthe public services they perform.\r\n\r\nI do not therefore see why the government should hesitate in resolving\r\nto put a stop to evils which the people of the Philippines have not\r\nceased to deplore from the time of the conquest, by proscribing, under\r\nthe most severe penalties, the power of trading, as now exercised\r\nby the provincial magistrates. The time is come when this struggle\r\nbetween duty and sordid interest ought to end, and reason, as well\r\nas enlightened policy, demand that in this respect our legislation\r\nshould be reformed, in order that the mace of justice, instead of\r\nbeing prostituted in search of lucre, may henceforwards be wholly\r\nemployed in the support of equity and the protection of society.\r\n\r\n[Urgence of reform.] The only objection which, at first sight, might\r\nbe started against the suggestions here thrown out is the increased\r\nexpense which would fall on the treasury, owing to the necessity of\r\nappropriating competent salaries for the interior magistrates under\r\nthe new order of things. Independent, however, of the fact that the\r\nrapid improvements the provinces must assume, in every point of view,\r\nwould superabundantly make up this trifling difference; yet supposing\r\nthe sacrifice were gratuitous, and even of some moment, it ought\r\nnot, on that account, to be omitted, since there is no public object\r\nmore important to the sovereign himself, than to make the necessary\r\nprovision for the decorum of the magistracy, the due administration\r\nof justice, and the maintenance of good order among his subjects.\r\n\r\nThe position being established, that a number of whites more\r\nthan sufficient might be obtained, eligible and fit to perform\r\nthe duties of civil magistrates, which they would be induced to\r\nundertake, if adequate terms were only proposed, it would seem that\r\nno ill consequences might be expected from at once assimilating\r\nthe regulations of these provincial judicatures to those of the\r\ncorregimientos, or mayoralties of towns in Spain, or in making out an\r\nexpress statute, on a triple scale, for three classes of magistrates,\r\ngranting to them emoluments equivalent to the greater or lesser\r\nextent of the respective jurisdictions. As far as regards the pay, it\r\nought to be so arranged as to act as a sufficient stimulus to induce\r\nEuropean colonists to embrace this career, in a fixed and permanent\r\nway, which hitherto they have only resorted to as a five years'\r\nspeculation. Conformably to this suggestion, and owing to the lesser\r\nvalue attached to money in India, compared with Europe, on account of\r\nthe greater abundance of the necessaries of life, I am of opinion that\r\nit would be expedient to affix an annual allowance of $2,000 to each\r\nof the appointments of the six principal and most populous provinces,\r\n$1,500 for the next in importance, and for the twelve or thirteen\r\nremaining, at the rate of $1,000 each; leaving to the candidates\r\nthe option of rising according to their length of services and good\r\nconduct, from the lowest to the highest, as is the case in Spain.\r\n\r\n[Objects to be gained.] The first part of the plan above pointed\r\nout embraces two objects. The one is to prevent the provincial\r\nmagistrates from carrying on traffic, thus depriving them of every\r\npretext to defraud the natives of what is their own; and the other,\r\nto form, in the course of a few years a class of men hitherto unknown\r\nin the Philippine Islands, who, taught by practice, may be enabled to\r\ngovern the provinces in a more correct and regular manner, and acquire\r\nmore extended knowledge, especially in the judicial proceedings of\r\nthe first instance, which, owing to this defect, frequently compel\r\nthe litigants to incur useless expenses, and greatly embarrass the\r\nordinary course of justice. Although the second part at first seems\r\nto involve an increased expense of $36,000 or $37,000 annually,\r\nwhen well considered, this sum will be found not to exceed $20,000,\r\nbecause it will be necessary to deduct from the above estimate the\r\namount of three per cent. under the existing regulations allowed to\r\nthe magistrates for the collection of the native tributes, in their\r\ncharacter of subdelegates, generally amounting to $16,000 or $17,000;\r\nbesides only taking into account such real and effective disbursements\r\nor extraordinary expenses as in fact they may legally have incurred\r\nin the performance of their duties.\r\n\r\nShould it, however, be deemed expedient, from causes just in their\r\nnature, hereafter to exonerate the natives from the obligations of\r\npaying tributes, by which means the amount deducted for the three\r\nper cent. commission could not then be brought into account, let\r\nme be allowed to ask what enlightened government would hesitate\r\nsubmitting to an additional expense of so trifling an import, in\r\nexchange for beholding more than two millions of men forever freed\r\nfrom the extortionate acts of their old magistrates; and, through\r\nthe effects of the new regulations, the latter converted into real\r\nfathers of the people over whom they are placed? How different would\r\nthen be the aspect these fine provinces would present to the eyes\r\nof the philosophical observer who would, in that case, be able to\r\ncalculate to what an extent the progress of agriculture and industry\r\nin these islands might be carried.\r\n\r\n[Demoralization of over-seas service.] Nevertheless, I do not wish\r\nto insinuate that by the better organization of the provincial\r\ngovernments, the present irregularities and abuses of authority\r\nwould entirely cease; because I am aware, more especially in the\r\nIndies, that the persons who hold public situations usually have too\r\nexaggerated ideas of their own personal importance, and easily mistake\r\nthe gratification of their own whims for firmness of character,\r\nin the necessity of causing themselves to be respected. Still it\r\nis an incontestable fact that, by removing the chief temptation,\r\nand rescinding altogether the license to trade, the just complaints\r\npreferred by the native against the Spaniard would cease; the motives\r\nof those continual disputes which arise between the magistrates\r\nand the ministers of the gospel exercising their functions in the\r\nsame provinces, and the zealous defenders of the rights of their\r\nparishioners, would be removed, and the inhabitants of Manila,\r\nextending their mercantile operations to the interior, without the\r\ndread of seeing them obstructed through the powerful competition\r\nof the magistrates in authority there, would be induced to settle\r\nin or connect themselves with the provinces, and thus diffuse their\r\nknowledge, activity and money among the inhabitants, the true means\r\nof encouraging the whole.\r\n\r\nWhat has already been said will suffice to convince the lover of\r\ntruth and the friend of general prosperity, how urgent it is to\r\nintroduce as early as possible, the reform proposed into the interior\r\nadministration of this important, although neglected colony; and it\r\nis to be hoped that the government, guided by these same sentiments,\r\nwill not be led away by those narrow-minded people, who predict danger\r\nfrom every thing that is new; but, after due and mature deliberation,\r\nresolve to adopt a measure dictated by reason, and at the same time\r\nconformable to the best interests of the state.\r\n\r\nOf little avail would have been the valor and constancy with which\r\nLegaspi and his worthy companions overcame the natives of these\r\nislands, if the apostolic zeal of the missionaries had not seconded\r\ntheir exertions, and aided to consolidate the enterprise. The latter\r\nwere the real conquerors; they who, without any other arms than their\r\nvirtues, won over the good will of the islanders, caused the Spanish\r\nname to be beloved, and gave to the king, as it were by a miracle,\r\ntwo millions more of submissive and Christian subjects. These were\r\nthe legislators of the barbarous hordes who inhabited the islands\r\nof this immense Archipelago, realizing, by their mild persuasion,\r\nthe allegorical prodigies of Amphion and Orpheus.\r\n\r\n[Pioneer Philippine government a theocracy.] As the means the\r\nmissionaries called in to their aid, in order to reduce and civilize\r\nthe Indians, were preaching and other spiritual labors, and, although\r\nscattered about and acting separately, they were still subject to\r\nthe authority of their prelates, who, like so many chiefs, directed\r\nthe grand work of conversion, the government primitively established\r\nin these colonies must necessarily have partaken greatly of the\r\ntheocratical order, and beyond doubt it continued to be so, till,\r\nby the lapse of time, the number of colonists increased, as well as\r\nthe effective strength of the royal authority, so as to render the\r\ngoverning system uniform with that established in the other ultramarine\r\ndominions of Spain.\r\n\r\nThis is also deduced from the fragments still remaining of the first\r\nconstitution, or mode of government introduced in the Batanes Islands\r\nand missions of Cagayan, administered by the Dominican friars in a\r\nspiritual and temporal manner; as well as from what may frequently be\r\nobserved in the other provinces, by any one who bestows the smallest\r\nattention. Although the civil magistracies have since been regulated,\r\nand their respective attributes determined with due precision, it has\r\nnot hitherto been possible, notwithstanding the pains taken to make the\r\ncontrary appear, to do without the personal authority and influence\r\nthe parish curates possess over their flocks. The government has, in\r\nfact, constantly been obliged to avail themselves of this aid, as the\r\nmost powerful instrument to insure respect and a due subordination,\r\nin such manner that, although the parish curates are not at present\r\nequally authorized to interfere in the civil administration, in point\r\nof fact, they are themselves the real administrators.\r\n\r\n[Standing of parish priests.] It happens that, as the parish curate\r\nis the consoler of the afflicted, the peacemaker of families, the\r\npromoter of useful ideas, the preacher and example of every thing good;\r\nas in him liberality is seen to shine, and the Indians behold him alone\r\nin the midst of them, without relatives, without traffic, and always\r\nbusied in their care and improvement, they become accustomed to live\r\nsatisfied and contented under his paternal direction, and deliver up to\r\nhim the whole of their confidence. In this way rendered the master of\r\ntheir wishes, nothing is done without the advice, or rather consent,\r\nof the curate. The subaltern governor, on receiving an order from the\r\nsuperior magistrate, before he takes any step, goes to the minister\r\nto obtain his sanction, and it is he in fact who tacitly gives the\r\nmandate for execution, or prevents its being carried into effect. As\r\nthe father of his flock, he arranges, or directs, the lawsuits of\r\nhis parishioners; it is he who draws out their writings; goes to the\r\ncapital to plead for the Indians; opposes his prayers, and sometimes\r\nhis threats, to the violent acts of the provincial magistrates, and\r\narranges every thing in the most fit and quiet manner. In a word, it\r\nis not possible for any human institution to be more simple, and at\r\nthe same time more firmly established, or from which so many advantages\r\nmight be derived in favor of the state, as the one so justly admired in\r\nthe spiritual ministry of these islands. It may therefore be considered\r\na strange fatality, when the secret and true art of governing a colony,\r\nso different from any other as is that of the Philippines, consists in\r\nthe wise use of so powerful an instrument as the one just described,\r\nthat the superior government, within the last few years, should have\r\nbeen so much deluded as to seek the destruction of a work which,\r\non the contrary, it is, above all others, advisable to sustain.\r\n\r\nIn this, as well as many other cases, we see how difficult, or rather\r\nhow absurd it is, to expect to organize a system of government,\r\nindistinctly adapted to the genius and disposition of all nations,\r\nhowever great the discordance prevailing in their physical and moral\r\nconstitutions. Hence it follows that, by wishing to assimilate\r\nthe administrative plan of these provinces to the one adopted in\r\nthe sections of America, inconveniences are unceasingly met with,\r\nevidently arising out of this erroneous principle. Whatever may\r\nbe asserted to the contrary, there is no medium. It is necessary to\r\ninsure obedience either through dread and force, or respect must be\r\nexcited by means of love and confidence. In order to be convinced that\r\nthe first is not practicable, it will only be necessary to weigh well\r\nthe following circumstances and reflections.\r\n\r\nThe number of the whites compared to that of the natives is so\r\nsmall, that it can scarcely be estimated in the proportion of 15\r\nto 25,000. These provinces, infinitely more populous than those of\r\nAmerica, are entirely delivered up to the charge of provincial [Friars\r\nonly check on officials.] magistrates, who carry with them to the seats\r\nof their respective governments, no other troops than the title of\r\nmilitary commandants, and their royal commission on parchment. Besides\r\nthe friars, it sometimes happens that no other white person is to be\r\nfound in an entire province, but the presiding magistrate. It is the\r\nduty of the latter to collect in the king's revenue; to pursue robbers;\r\nappease tumults; raise men for the regiments in garrison at Manila and\r\nCavite; regulate and head his people in case of an external invasion,\r\nand, in short, it is he who is to do everything in the character of\r\nmagistrate and in the name of the king. Considering, therefore, the\r\neffective power required for the due performance of so great a variety\r\nof duties, and the want of that species of support experienced by him\r\nwho is charged with them, can it be denied that it would be risking the\r\nsecurity of these dominions too much, to attempt forcibly to control\r\nthem with means so insufficient? If the inhabitants become tumultuous\r\nand rise up, on whom will the magistrate call for aid to repress and\r\npunish them? In such a predicament, is any other alternative left him\r\nthan to fly or die in the struggle? If among civilized nations, it is\r\ndeemed indispensable that authority should always appear accompanied\r\nwith force, how can it be expected, among Indians, that the laws will\r\notherwise be respected, when left naked and unsupported?\r\n\r\n[Missionaries' achievements.] Evidently, it is necessary to appeal to\r\naid of another kind, and to employ means, which, although indirect\r\nones, are, beyond all dispute, the best adapted to the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of the country,--means which, by influencing the mind,\r\nexcite veneration, subdue the rude understanding of the inhabitants,\r\nand incline them to bear our dominion without repugnance. It is well\r\nunderstood what these means are, how much they are at hand, and how\r\ngreatly also they have always been envied by other European nations,\r\nwho have sought to extend and consolidate their conquests in both\r\nthe Indies. Let us listen to La Pérouse, if we wish to know and\r\nadmire the army with which our missionaries subdued the natives of\r\nboth Californias; let us read, dispassionately, the wonderful deeds\r\nof the Jesuits in other parts of America, and, above all, let us\r\nvisit the Philippine Islands and, with astonishment, shall we there\r\nbehold extended ranges, studded with temples and spacious convents;\r\nthe Divine worship celebrated with pomp and splendor; regularity\r\nin the streets, and even luxury in the houses and dress; schools\r\nof the first rudiments in all the towns, and the inhabitants well\r\nversed in the art of writing. We shall there see causeways raised,\r\nbridges of a good architecture built, and, in short, all the measure\r\nof good government and police, in the greatest part of the country,\r\ncarried into effect, yet the whole is due to the exertions, apostolic\r\nlabors and pure patriotism of the ministers of religion. Let us\r\ntravel over the provinces, and we shall there see towns of 5000,\r\n10,000, and 20,000 Indians, peacefully governed by one weak old man,\r\nwho, with his doors open at all hours, sleeps quiet and secure in\r\nhis dwelling, without any other magic, or any other guards, than the\r\nlove and respect with which he has known to inspire his flock. And,\r\nwhen this is contemplated, can it be deemed possible, through foolish\r\njealousy and vain wish for those persons only pointed out by the\r\ngeneral laws in ordinary cases, to intervene in the government of the\r\nnatives, that the fruit of so much time constancy are not to be lost,\r\nbut also by hereafter disregarding and rejecting a co-operation,\r\nas efficient as it is economical, that attempts should purposely be\r\nmade to destroy the mainspring of the whole of this political machine?\r\n\r\n[Curtailing priestly authority.] Such, nevertheless, are the mistaken\r\nideas which, within the last few years, have unhappily led to the\r\nadoption of measures, diametrically opposed to the public interest,\r\nunder the pretext of curtailing the excessive authority of the\r\nparish-curates. The superior government, not satisfied with having\r\ndeprived the ministers of the faculty of personally prescribing certain\r\ncorrectional punishments, which although of little moment, when applied\r\nwith discretion, greatly contributed to fortify their ascendency,\r\nand consequently, that of the sovereign; but, in order to exclude and\r\ndivest them of all intervention in the civil administration, a direct\r\nattempt has also been made to lower the esteem in which they are held,\r\nby awakening the distrust of the Indian, and, as much as possible,\r\nremoving him to a greater distance from them. In proof of this, and\r\nin order that what has been said may not be deemed an exaggeration,\r\nit will suffice to quote the substance of two regulations, remarkable\r\nfor their obvious tendency to weaken the influence and credit of the\r\nspiritual administrators.\r\n\r\nBy one of these, it is enacted that in order to prevent the abuses\r\nand notorious malversation of the funds of the sanctuary, specially\r\napplicable to the expenses of the festivities and worship of each\r\nparish, and arising out of the real and half for this purpose\r\ncontributed by each tributary person, and collected and privately\r\nadministered by the curate, the same shall hereafter be kept in a chest\r\nwith three keys, and lodged in the head-town of each province. The keys\r\nare to be left, one in possession of the chief magistrate, another in\r\nthe hands of the governor of the respective town, and the remaining\r\none with the parish-curate. By the other measure it is declared, as\r\na standing rule, that no Indian, who may lately have been employed\r\nin the domestic service of the curate, shall in his own town be\r\nconsidered eligible to any office belonging to the judicial department.\r\n\r\nOn measures of this kind, comments are unnecessary; their meaning and\r\neffect cannot be mistaken. I shall, therefore, merely observe, that\r\nno untimely means could have been devised more injurious to the state,\r\nto the propagation of religion, and even to the natives themselves. It\r\nis, in fact, a most strange affair, that such endeavors should have\r\nbeen made to impeach the purity, by at the same time degrading the\r\nrespectable character of the parish-curates, more particularly at a\r\nperiod when, owing to partality and the scarcity of religious men,\r\nit would have seemed more natural to uphold, and by new inducements\r\nencourage the zeal and authority of the remaining few. This step\r\nappears the more singular, I repeat, at a moment when, neither\r\nby suspending the sending out of missionaries to China, and the\r\nalmost entire abandonment of the spiritual conquest of the Igorots\r\nand other infidel tribes, inhabiting the interior of these islands,\r\nhave the above Spanish laborers been able to carry on the ordinary\r\nadministration, nor prevent entire provinces from being transferred,\r\nas is now the case, into the hands of Indians and mestizo clergymen\r\nof the Sangley race, who, through their great ignorance, corrupt\r\nmorals, and total want of decorum, universally incur the contempt\r\nof the flocks committed to their care, and, in consequence of their\r\ntyrannical conduct, cause the people to sigh for the mild yoke of\r\ntheir ancient pastors.\r\n\r\n[Friars bulwark of Spanish rule.] If, therefore, it is the wish of\r\nthe government to retain the subjection of this colony, and raise\r\nit to the high degree of prosperity of which it is susceptible,\r\nthe first thing, in my opinion, that ought to be attended to is the\r\ngood organization of its spiritual administration. On this subject\r\nwe must not deceive ourselves. I again repeat, that as long as the\r\nlocal government, in consequence of the want of military forces,\r\nand owing to the scarcity of Europeans, does not in itself possess\r\nthe means of insuring obedience, no other alternative remains. It is\r\nnecessary to call in to its aid the powerful influence of religion,\r\nand to obtain from the Peninsula fresh supplies of missionaries. As\r\nin their nature the latter are essentially different from the other\r\npublic functionaries, it is well known they neither seek nor aspire to\r\nany remuneration for their labors, their only hope being to obtain,\r\nin the opinion of the community at large, that degree of respect to\r\nwhich they justly consider themselves entitled. Let, therefore, their\r\npre-eminences be retained to them: let them be treated with decorum;\r\nthe care and direction of the Indians confided to their charge, and\r\nthey always be found united in support of justice and the legitimate\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n[Unwise to discredit priests.] Nothing is more unjust, and of nothing\r\nhave the spiritual directors of the provinces so much reason to\r\ncomplain, than the little discernment with which they have sometimes\r\nbeen judged and condemned, by causing the misconduct of some of their\r\nindividual members to affect the whole body. Hence is it that no one\r\ncan read without shame and indignation, the insidious suggestions and\r\nallusions, derogatory to their character, contained in the Regulations\r\nof Government framed at Manila in the year 1758, and which although\r\nmodified by orders of the king, are at the present moment still in\r\nforce, owing to the want of others, and found in a printed form in\r\nthe hands of every one. Granting that in some particular instances,\r\nreal causes of complaint might have existed, yet in the end, what\r\ndoes it matter if here and there a religious character has abused\r\nthe confidence reposed in him, as long as the spirit by which the\r\ngenerality of them are actuated, corresponds to the sanctity of their\r\nstate, and is besides conformable to the views of government? Why\r\nshould we be eternally running after an ideal of perfection which\r\ncan never be met with? Nor, indeed, is this necessary in the present\r\nconstruction of society.\r\n\r\n[Testimony in their behalf] If, however, any weight is to be attached\r\nto imposture with which, from personal motives, attempts have been\r\nmade to obscure the truth, and prejudice the public mind against\r\nthe regular clergy; or, if the just defense on which I have entered,\r\nshould be attributed to partiality or visionary impressions, let the\r\nArchives of the Colonial Department be opened, and we shall there\r\nfind the report drawn up by order of the king on November 26, 1804, by\r\nthe governor of the Philippine Islands, Don Rafael Maria de Aguilar,\r\nwith a view to convey information regarding the enquiries at that\r\ntime instituted respecting the reduction of the inhabitants of the\r\nIsland of Mindoro; a report extremely honorable to the regular clergy,\r\nand dictated by the experience that general had acquired during a\r\nperiod of more than twelve years he had governed. Therein also will\r\nbe seen the answer to the consultation addressed to his successor in\r\nthe command, Don Mariano Fernandez de Folgueras, under date of April\r\n25, 1809, in which he most earnestly beseeches the king to endeavor,\r\nby every possible means, to send out religious missionaries; deploring\r\nthe decline and want of order he had observed with his own eyes in the\r\ntowns administered by native clergymen, and pointing out the urgent\r\nnecessity of intrusting the spiritual government of these provinces\r\nto the dexterous management of the former. Testimonies of such weight\r\nare more than sufficient at once to refute the calumnies and contrary\r\nopinions put forth on this subject, and at the same time serve as\r\nirrefragable proofs of the scrupulous impartiality with which I have\r\nendeavored to discuss so delicate a matter.\r\n\r\nIn a general point of view, I have alluded to the erroneous system,\r\nwhich during the last few years has been pursued by the government\r\nwith regard to the parish-curates employed in the interior, and also\r\nsufficiently pointed out the advantages reasonably to be expected\r\nif the government, acting on a different policy, or rather guided\r\nby other motives of state, instead of following the literal text\r\nof our Indian legislation, should come to the firm determination of\r\nindirectly divesting themselves of a small portion of their authority\r\nin favor of the religious laborers who are acting on the spot. Having\r\nsaid thus much, I shall proceed to such further details as are more\r\nimmediately connected with the present chapter.\r\n\r\n[Ecclesiastical Organization.] The ecclesiastical jurisdiction is\r\nexercised by the metropolitan archbishop of Manila, aided by the\r\nthree suffragans of Nueva Segovia, Nueva Caceres and Cebu.\r\n\r\nThe archbishopric of Manila comprehends the provinces of Tondo,\r\nBulacan, Pampanga, Bataan, Cavite, Laguna de Bay, Zambales, Batangas,\r\nand the Island of Mindoro.\r\n\r\nThe bishopric of Nueva Segovia comprehends the province of Pangasinan,\r\nthe missions of Ituy and Paniqui, the provinces of Ilocos, Cagayan,\r\nand the missions of the Batanes Islands.\r\n\r\nThat of Nueva Caceres comprehends the provinces of Tayabas, Nueva\r\nEcija, Camarines and Albay.\r\n\r\nThat of Cebu comprehends the Islands of Cebu and Bohol, Iloilo,\r\nCapiz and Antique, in the Island of Panay, the Islands of La Paragua,\r\nNegros and Samar, Misamis, Caraga and Zamboanga in that of Mindanao,\r\nand the Mariana Islands.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop has a salary of $5,000 and the bishops $4,000 each. The\r\ncuracies exceed 500, and although all of them originally were in charge\r\nof persons belonging to the religious orders, owing to the expulsion\r\nof the Jesuits and the excessive scarcity of regular clergy, so many\r\nnative priests have gradually been introduced among them, that,\r\nat present, nearly half the towns are under their direction. The\r\nrest are administered by the religious orders of St. Augustine,\r\nSt. Dominic and St. Francis, in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                Towns.\r\n    The Augustinians                            88\r\n    The barefooted Augustinians (Recoletos)     52\r\n    The Dominicans                              57\r\n    The Franciscans                             96\r\n    Total                                      293\r\n\r\n\r\nIt ought, however, to be observed, that since the detailed statement\r\nwas made out, from which the above extract has been taken, so many\r\nmembers of the religious orders have died, that it has been necessary\r\nto replace them in many towns with native clergymen, as a temporary\r\nexpedient, and till new missionaries shall arrive from Spain.\r\n\r\n[Dual supervision over friars.] The monastic curates are immediately\r\nsubject to their provincial superior, in the character of friars but\r\ndepend on the diocesan bishop in their quality of parish priests; and\r\nin like manner obey their own provincial vicars, as well as those of\r\nthe bishop. They are alternately eligible to the dignities of their\r\nown order, and generally promoted, or relieved from their ministry,\r\nat the discretion of the provincial chapter, or according to the final\r\ndetermination of the vice-patron or bishop, affixed to the triple\r\nlist presented to him. Besides the ordinary obligations attached to\r\nthe care of souls, they are enjoined to assist at the elections of\r\ngovernors and other officers of justice, in their respective towns,\r\nin order to inform the chief magistrate respecting the aptitude of\r\nthe persons proposed for election on the triple lists, and to point\r\nout the legal defects attributable to any of them. On this account,\r\nthey are not, however, allowed to interfere in the smallest degree\r\nwith any of these proceedings, and much less make a formal proposal,\r\nas most assuredly would be advisable if permitted so to do, in favor\r\nof any particular person or persons in their opinion fit for the\r\ndischarge of the above mentioned duties. It is their obligation to\r\nascertain the correctness of the tribute lists presented to them\r\nfor their examination and signature by the chief of the clans,\r\nby carefully comparing them with the registers kept in their own\r\ndepartment; and also to certify the general returns, without which\r\nrequisite the statements transmitted by the chief magistrates to\r\nthe accountant-general's office are not admitted. Above all they\r\nare bound to affix their signatures to the effective payments made\r\nby the magistrate to their parishioners on account of daily labor,\r\nand to certify similarly the value of materials employed in public\r\nworks. Besides the above, they are continually called upon to draw\r\nup circumstantial reports, or declarations, required by the superior\r\ntribunals; they receive frequent injunctions to co-operate in the\r\nincrease of the king's revenue and the encouragement of agriculture\r\nand industry; in a word, there is scarcely a thing to which their\r\nattention is not called, and to which it is not expected they should\r\ncontribute by their influence, directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\n[Allowances from treasury.] The royal treasury pays them an annual\r\nallowance equal to $180, in kind and money, for each five hundred\r\ntributes under their care, and this, added to the emoluments of the\r\nchurch, renders the total proceeds of a curacy generally equivalent\r\nto about from six to eight reals for each entire tribute; but\r\nfrom this allowance are to be deducted the expenses of coadjutors,\r\nsubsistence, servants, horses, and all the other charges arising\r\nout of the administration of such wearisome duties; nor are the\r\nparishioners under any other obligation than to provide the churches\r\nwith assistants, or sacristans and singers, and the curates with\r\nprovisions at tariff prices.\r\n\r\n[Need of more European clergy.] Finally, as from what has been above\r\nstated it would appear, that as many as five hundred religious persons\r\nare necessary for the spiritual administration of the interior towns\r\nand districts, besides the number requisite to do the duty and fill\r\nthe dignities of the respective orders and convents in the capital,\r\nindependent of which there ought to be a proportionate surplus,\r\napplicable to the progressive reduction of the infidel tribes\r\ninhabiting the uplands, as well as the preaching of the Gospel\r\nin China and Cochinchina, most assuredly, it would be expedient\r\nto assemble and keep together a body of no less than seven hundred\r\npersons, if it is the wish of the government, on a tolerable scale, to\r\nprovide for the wants of these remote missions. At the present moment\r\nthe number does not exceed three hundred, including superannuated,\r\nexempt from service, and lay-brothers, whilst the native clergymen\r\nin effective possession of curacies, and including substitutes,\r\ncoadjutors and weekly preachers, exceed one thousand. And as the\r\nlatter, in general unworthy of the priesthood, are rather injurious\r\nthan really serviceable to the state, it should not be deemed unjust\r\nif they were altogether deprived of the dignity of parish curates,\r\nand only allowed to exercise their functions in necessary cases, or by\r\nattaching them to the curacies in the quality of coadjutors. By this\r\nplan, at the same time that the towns would be provided with suitable\r\nand adequate ministers, the native clergymen would be distributed\r\nin a proper manner and placed near the religious persons charged\r\nto officiate, would acquire the necessary knowledge and decorum,\r\nand in the course of time might obtain character and respect among\r\ntheir countrymen.\r\n\r\nTo many, a measure of this kind may, in some respects, appear harsh\r\nand arbitrary; but persons, practically acquainted with the subject\r\nand country, will deem it indispensable, and the only means that\r\ncan be resorted to, in order to stop the rapid decline remarkable in\r\nthis interesting department of public administration. Fortunately,\r\nno grounded objections can be alleged against it; nor is there any\r\ndanger of serious consequences resulting from the plan being carried\r\ninto effect. In vain would it be to argue that, if the reform is to\r\ntake place, a large number of priests would be reduced to beggary,\r\nowing to the want of occupation; because, as things now stand, many of\r\nthe religious curates employ three or four coadjutors, and, no doubt,\r\nthey would then gladly undertake to make provision for the remainder\r\nof those who may be thrown out of employment. On the other hand, with\r\nequal truth it may be observed that the inhabitants of the interior,\r\nfar from regretting, or taking part on behalf of the native clergy,\r\nwould celebrate, as a day of gladness and rejoicing, the removal of\r\nthe latter, in return for their beloved Castilian Fathers.\r\n\r\n[Restriction of native ordinations recommended.] In case the ideas\r\nabove suggested should be adopted in all their parts, it may be proper\r\nto add that an injunction ought to be laid on the reverend bishops\r\nin future to confer holy orders with more scrupulosity and economy,\r\nthan, unfortunately, heretofore has been the case; by representing to\r\nthem that, if, at certain periods the Popes have been influenced by\r\npowerful reasons not to insist on ordinations taking place in Europe,\r\nas was formerly the case, very weighty motives now equally urge the\r\ngovernment to decline, in the Philippine Islands, paying so much to\r\nreligious vocation, and to relax in the policy of raising the natives\r\nto the dignity of the priesthood.\r\n\r\n[Moro depredations.] Long have the inhabitants of the Philippines\r\ndeplored, and in vain remonstrated, against the ravages committed\r\non their coasts and settlements by the barbarous natives of the\r\nIslands of Mindanao, Basilan and Jolo, as well as by the Malanos,\r\nIlanos and Tirone Moros and others; and there is nothing that so much\r\ndeserves the attention, and interests the honor of the Captain-General\r\ncommanding in this quarter, as an early and efficient attempt to check\r\nand punish these cruel enemies. It is indeed true that, in the years\r\n1636 and 1638, General Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, undertook in\r\nperson and happily carried into effect the reduction of the Sultan of\r\nMindanao and the conquest of the Island of Jolo, placing in the latter\r\na governor and establishing three military posts there; under the\r\nprotection of the garrisons of which, Christianity was considerably\r\nextended. It is equally true, that on the subsequent abandonment of\r\nthis important acquisition, owing to the government being compelled to\r\nattend to other urgent matters, the enemy acquired a greater degree of\r\naudacity, and the captain-general in command afterwards sent armaments\r\nto check his inroads. On one of these occasions, our troops obliged an\r\narmy of more than 5,000 Moros, who had closely beset the fortress of\r\nZamboanga, to raise the siege; and also in the years 1731 and 1734,\r\nfresh detachments of our men were landed on the Islands of Jolo,\r\nCapul and Basilan, and their success was followed by the destruction\r\nand ruin of the fortified posts, vessels, and settlements of those\r\nperfidious Mahometans. It is not, however, less certain that at the\r\nperiods above mentioned, the war was carried on rather from motives\r\nof punishment and revenge, and suggested by a sudden and passing zeal,\r\nthan in conformity to any progressive and well-combined system. Since\r\nthen these laudable military enterprises have been entirely neglected,\r\nas well on account of the indolence of some of the governors, as\r\nthe too great confidence placed in the protestations of friendship\r\nand treaties of peace with which, from time to time, the Sultans\r\nof Jolo and Mindanao have sought to lull them to sleep. Their want\r\nof sincerity is proved by the circumstance of the piracies of their\r\nrespective subjects not ceasing, the chiefs sometimes feigning they\r\nwere carried on without their license or knowledge; and, at others,\r\nexcusing themselves on the plea of their inability to restrain the\r\ninsolence of the Tirones and other independent tribes. Nevertheless,\r\nit is notorious that the above-mentioned sultans indirectly encouraged\r\nthe practice of privateering, by affording every aid in their power\r\nto those who fitted out vessels, and purchasing from the pirates all\r\nthe Christians they captured and brought to them.\r\n\r\n[A missionary's appeal.] Father Juan Angeles, superior of the mission\r\nestablished in Jolo, at the request of Sultan Alimudin himself (or\r\nFerdinand I as he was afterwards unworthily called on being made a\r\nChristian with no other view than the better to gain the confidence\r\nof the Spaniards) in a report he sent to the government from the\r\nabove Island, under date of September 24, 1748, describing the\r\nSultan's singular artifices to amuse him and frustrate the object\r\nof his mission, fully confirms all that has just been said, and,\r\non closing his report, makes use of the following remarkable words:\r\n\r\n\"When is it we shall have had enough of treaties with these Moros, for\r\nhave we not before us the experience of more than one hundred years,\r\nduring which period of time, they have not kept a single article\r\nin any way burdensome to, or binding on, themselves? They will never\r\nobserve the conditions of peace, because their property consists in the\r\npossession of slaves, and with them they traffic, the same as other\r\nnations do with money. Sooner will the hawk release his prey from\r\nhis talons than they will put an end to their piracies. The cause of\r\ntheir being still unfaithful to Spain arises out of this matter having\r\nbeen taken up by fits and starts, and not in the serious manner it\r\nought to have been done. To make war on them, in an effectual manner,\r\nfleets must not be employed, but they must be attacked on land, and\r\nin their posts in the interior; for it is much more advisable at once\r\nto spend ten with advantage and in a strenuous manner to attain an\r\nimportant object than to lay out twenty by degrees and without fruit.\"\r\n\r\n[Governmental lenience.] It is an undeniable fact that the government,\r\nlulled and deceived by the frequent embassies and submissive and\r\ncrouching letters which those fawning sultans have been in the habit\r\nof transmitting to them, instead of adopting the energetic measures\r\nurged by the above-mentioned missionary, have constantly endeavored\r\nto renew and secure the friendship of those chiefs, by means of\r\ntreaties and commercial relations; granting, with this view, ample\r\nlicenses to every one who ventured to ship merchandise to Jolo, and\r\nwinking at the traffic carried on by the governors of the fortress of\r\nZamboanga with the people of Mindanao; whilst the latter, on their\r\npart, sporting with our foolish credulity, have never ceased waging\r\na most destructive war against us, by attacking our towns situated\r\non the coast, not even excepting those of the Island of Luzon. They\r\nhave sometimes carried their audacity so far as to show themselves\r\nin the neighborhood of the capital itself, and at others taken up\r\ntheir temporary residence in the district of Mindoro and in places\r\nof the jurisdictions of Samar and Leyte; and in short, even dared\r\nto form an establishment or general deposit for their plunder in the\r\nIsland of Buras, where they quietly remained during the years 1797,\r\n1798 and 1799 to the great injury of our commerce and settlements.\r\n\r\n[Authority for war not lacking.] This want of exertion to remedy evils\r\nof so grievous a nature is the more to be deplored as the Philippine\r\ngovernors have at all times been fully authorized to carry on war,\r\nand promote the destruction of the Moros, under every sacrifice, and\r\nespecially by the royal orders and decrees of October 26, and November\r\n1, 1758, and July 31, 1766, in all of which his majesty recommends,\r\nin the most earnest manner, \"the importance of punishing the audacity\r\nof the barbarous infidels, his majesty being desirous that, in order\r\nto maintain his subjects of the Philippines free from the piracies and\r\ncaptivity they so frequently experience, no expenses or pains should\r\nbe spared; it being further declared, that as this is an object deeply\r\naffecting the conscience of his majesty, he especially enjoins the\r\naforesaid government to observe his order; and finally, with a view\r\nto provide for the exigencies arising out of similar enterprises,\r\nthe viceroy of New Spain is instructed to attend to the punctual\r\nremittance, not only of the usual \"situado,\" or annual allowance,\r\nbut also of the additional sum of $70,000 in the first and succeeding\r\nyears, etc.\" In a word, our monarchs, Ferdinand VI and Carlos III,\r\nomitted nothing that could in any way promote so important an object;\r\nwhether it is that the governors have disregarded such repeated orders\r\nfrom the sovereigns, or mistaken the means by which they were to be\r\ncarried into effect, certain it is that the unhappy inhabitants of\r\nthe Philippines have continued to be witnesses, and at the same time\r\nthe victims of the culpable apathy of those who have successively\r\nheld the command of these Islands within the last fifty or sixty years.\r\n\r\n[Native efforts for self-defence.] Abandoned therefore to their own\r\nresources, and from time to time relieved by the presence of a few\r\ngunboats which, after scouring the coasts, have never been able\r\nto come up with the light and fast sailing vessels of the enemy,\r\nthe inhabitants of our towns and settlements have been under the\r\nnecessity of intrenching and fortifying themselves in the best way\r\nthey were able, by opening ditches and planting a breastwork of stakes\r\nand palisades, crowned with watch towers, or a wooden or stone castle;\r\nprecautions which sometimes are not sufficient against the nocturnal\r\nirruptions and robberies of the Moros, more especially when they come\r\nwith any strength and fire-arms, in general scarce among the natives.\r\n\r\n[Moro piratical craft.] The pancos, or prows, used by the Moros, are\r\nlight and simple vessels, built with numerous thin planks and ribs,\r\nwith a small draft of water; and being manned by dexterous rowers,\r\nthey appear and disappear from the horizon with equal celerity, flying\r\nor attacking, whenever they can do it with evident advantage. Some\r\nof those vessels are large, and fitted out with fifty, a hundred,\r\nand sometimes two hundred men. The shots of their scanty and defective\r\nartillery are very uncertain, because they generally carry their guns\r\nsuspended in slings; but they are to be dreaded, and are extremely\r\ndexterous in the management of the campilan, or sword, of which they\r\nwear the blades long and well tempered. When they have any attack\r\nof importance in view, they generally assemble to the number of\r\ntwo hundred galleys, or more, and even in their ordinary cruises,\r\na considerable number navigate together. As dread and the scarcity\r\nof inhabitants in the Bisayan Islands cause great ranges of the coast\r\nto be left unsettled, it is very easy for the Moros to find numerous\r\nlurking-places and strongholds whenever they are pressed, and their\r\nconstant practice, in these cases, is to enter the rivers, ground\r\ntheir vessels, and hide them among the mangroves and thick foliage,\r\nand fly with their arms to the mountains, thus almost always laughing\r\nat the efforts of their opponents, who seldom venture to follow them\r\ninto the thickets and morasses, where the musket is of no use and a\r\nsingle step cannot be taken with any security.\r\n\r\n[Outrages suffered.] The fatal consequences and ravages of this system\r\nof cruising and warfare round the Islands are incalculable. Besides\r\nplundering and burning the towns and settlements, these bloody\r\npirates put the old and helpless to the sword, destroy the cattle\r\nand plantations, and annually carry off to their own homes as many as\r\na thousand captives of both sexes, who, if they are poor and without\r\nhopes of being redeemed, are destined to drag out a miserable existence\r\namidst the most fatiguing and painful labor, sometimes accompanied\r\nwith torments. Such is the dread and apprehension of these seas that\r\nonly those navigate and carry on trade in them who are able to arm and\r\nman their vessels in a way corresponding to the great risks they have\r\nto run, or others whom want compels to disregard the imminent dangers\r\nwhich await them. Among the latter class, the Bisayans, or \"painted\r\n(tattooed) natives,\" are distinguished, an extremely warlike people of\r\nwhom great use might be made. Reared from their infancy amidst danger\r\nand battle, and greatly resembling the Moros in their features and\r\ndarkness of skin, they are equally alike in the agility with which\r\nthey manage the long sword and lance, and such is the courage and\r\nimplacable odium with which they treat their enemies that, if not taken\r\nby surprise, they sell their lives very dear, sacrificing themselves\r\nin a most heroic manner, rather than to be led away as captives.\r\n\r\nIn order, however, that a more correct idea may be formed of the\r\nwicked policy and atrocious disposition of these Moros, and with a\r\nview to do away with the misconceptions of those who are of opinion\r\nthat incentives to trade, and other slow and indirect means ought\r\nto be employed for the purpose of overcoming them, it will suffice\r\nto quote the following examples among a number of others, even more\r\nrecent ones, which might equally be brought forward.\r\n\r\n[Instances of treachery.] In 1796, the governor of Zamboanga\r\ndispatched, with regular passports and under a safe conduct obtained\r\nfrom the Sultan of Mindanao, Lieutenant Don Pantaleon Arcillas,\r\nwith a sergeant, eight men, and a guide, in order to bring into\r\nthe fortress the cattle belonging to the king's farm, which had\r\nstrayed away and got up in the lands of the above-mentioned Mahometan\r\nprince. Five days after their departure, whilst the lieutenant was\r\ntaking his meals at the house of a \"Datu,\" or chief, named Oroncaya,\r\nhe was suddenly surrounded by seventy Moros, who, seizing upon him,\r\nbound him to a tree and then flayed him alive, from the forehead to\r\nthe ankle. In this miserable and defenceless situation, the barbarous\r\n\"Datu\" wreaked his vengeance on his body by piercing it all over\r\nwith his \"kris,\" or dagger, and then ordered his skin to be hung up\r\non the pole of one of his ferocious banners.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1798, whilst the schooner San José lay at anchor at\r\nTabitabi, near Jolo, the sons-in-law and nephews of the sultan went\r\nout to meet her in two large prows, exhibiting at the same time every\r\ndemonstration of peace, and, sending forward a small vessel with\r\nrefreshments, they invited the captain to come on board of them. The\r\nlatter, deceived by the apparent frankness and high rank of the Moros,\r\nwith the greatest good faith accepted the invitation, and proceeded on\r\nboard, accompanied by two sailors, with a view to make arrangements\r\nfor barter. Scarcely had they got on board of the large prow, when\r\nthey were surrounded and seized, and the captain, who was a Spaniard,\r\ncompelled to sign an order to his mate to deliver up the schooner,\r\nwhich he reluctantly did, under the hope of saving his own and his\r\ncompanions' lives. The Moros proceeded on board the Spanish vessel,\r\nand, in the meantime, the two sailors were taken back to the boat,\r\nand there killed with daggers in the presence of all. The schooner's\r\nsails were next hoisted, and she was brought into Jolo, where the cargo\r\nand crew were sold in sight of, and with the knowledge and consent of\r\nthe sultan; an atrocity for which he has always refused to give any\r\nsatisfaction to a nation, thus openly and barbarously outraged by his\r\nown relatives, and in defiance of the existing treaties of peace. Such\r\nis the cruel character, and such the execrable policy of the Moros\r\ngenerally inhabiting the Islands situated in the Philippine seas.\r\n\r\n[Growth of Moro power.] The most lamentable circumstance is, that\r\nthese infidel races, at all times to be dreaded, owing to their\r\nnumbers and savage ferocity, after the lapse of a century of almost\r\nuninterrupted prosperity, and encouraged also by our inattention,\r\nhave at length gradually attained so formidable a degree of power,\r\nthat their reduction now must be considered an extremely arduous and\r\nexpensive enterprise, although an object urgently requisite, and worthy\r\nof the greatness of a nation like ours. In order, however, that the\r\ndifficulties of so important an undertaking may be justly appreciated,\r\nit may be proper to observe that the Island of Mindanao alone, at\r\nthe present moment, contains a population equal, if not larger, than\r\nthat of Luzon, and the margins of the immense lake, situated in its\r\ncenter, are covered with well-built towns, filled with conveniences,\r\nthe fruits of their annual privateering, and of the traffic they\r\ncarry on with the inhabitants of the Island of Jolo. True it is,\r\nand it may be said, equally fortunate, that they are greatly divided\r\ninto parties, subject to a variety of \"datus,\" or independent chiefs,\r\nin name only inferior to the one who styles himself the sultan of the\r\nwhole Island. As, however, the fortresses and districts of Caraga,\r\nMisamis, and Zamboanga occupy nearly three parts of the circumference\r\nof the Island, these Moros freely possess no more than the southern\r\npart, commencing at about twenty-five leagues from Cape San Augustin,\r\nand ending in the vicinity of Zamboanga; so that the largest number\r\nof their naval armaments are fitted out and issued to sea, either by\r\nthe great river of Mindanao, or from some of the many bays and inlets\r\nsituated on the above extent of coast.\r\n\r\n[Jolo.] The Island of Jolo, although small compared with that of\r\nMindanao, is, nevertheless, in itself the most important, as well\r\nas the real hotbed of all the piracies committed. Its inhabitants,\r\naccording to the unanimous reports of captives and various merchants,\r\nin skill and valor greatly exceed the other Mahometans who infest\r\nthese seas. The sultan is absolute, and his subjects carry on trade\r\nwith Borneo, Celebes, and the other Malayan tribes scattered about\r\nthis great Archipelago. In the port of Jolo, as already noticed,\r\nsales are made of Christians captured by the other Moros. The Chinese\r\nof Amoy, as well as the Dutch and British, carry them manufactured\r\ngoods, opium and arms, receiving, in return, black pepper, bees'\r\nwax, balato, edible nests, tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl, gold\r\ndust, pearls, etc., and from Manila also a vessel usually goes once\r\na year with goods; but all act with the greatest precaution in this\r\ndangerous traffic, guarding, as much as possible, against the insidious\r\nacts of that perfidious government. The great number of renegades,\r\nof all casts, who have successively naturalized themselves there;\r\nthe abundance of arms, and the prevailing opulence, have, in every\r\nrespect, contributed to render this Island a formidable and powerful\r\nstate. The capital is surrounded with forts and thick walls, and\r\nthe famous heights, standing near it, in case of emergency, afford a\r\nsecure asylum where the women can take refuge and the treasures of\r\nthe sultan and public be deposited, whilst in the plains below the\r\ncontest may be maintained by more than 50,000 combatants, already\r\nvery dexterous in the use of the musket and of a bold and courageous\r\ncharacter. The navy of these Islanders is also very respectable,\r\nfor, besides a great number of smaller prows and war-boats, they\r\nhave some of a large size, capable of carrying heavy artillery on\r\ntheir decks, mounted on corresponding carriages, and not suspended\r\nin slings as is the custom of the people of Mindanao. In a word,\r\nJolo is an Island governed by a system of administration extremely\r\nvigorous and decisive; dread and superstition sustain the throne of\r\nthe tyrant, and the fame of his greatness frequently brings to his\r\nfeet the ulemas, or missionaries of the Koran, even as far as from\r\nthe furthest margin of the Red Sea. The prince and people, unanimous\r\nin the implacable odium with which they view all Christians, cannot\r\nbe divided or kept on terms of peace; and if it is really wished to\r\nfree these seas from the evils and great dangers with which they are\r\nat all times threatened, it is necessary at once to strike at the\r\nroot, by landing and attacking the Jolonese in their strongholds,\r\nand break the charm by which they are held together.\r\n\r\nThis, at least, is the constant and unshaken opinion of all\r\nexperienced persons and those versed in Philippine affairs; and if,\r\nby the substantial reasons and existing circumstances, I convince\r\nmyself sufficiently to openly recommend war to be undertaken against\r\nthe Moros and pushed with the utmost vigor, and more particularly\r\ncommencing the work by a formal invasion of Jolo; still, as I feel\r\nmyself incompetent to trace a precise plan, or to discuss the minute\r\ndetails more immediately connected with the object, I feel it necessary\r\nto confine myself to the pointing out, in general terms, of the means\r\nI judge most conducive to the happy issue of so arduous but important\r\nan enterprise, leaving the rest to more able and experienced hands.\r\n\r\n[Council of war recommended.] As a previous step, I conceive that\r\na council of war ought to be formed in Manila, composed of the\r\ncaptain-general, the commanders of the navy, artillery, and engineer\r\ndepartment, as well as of the regular corps, who, in conformity to\r\nall the antecedent information lodged in the secretary's office for\r\nthe captain-generalship, and the previous report of some one of the\r\nex-governors of Zamboanga and the best informed missionaries, may be\r\nenabled to deliberate and proceed on to a mature examination of the\r\nwhole affair, taking into their special consideration everything\r\nregarding Jolo, its early reduction, the number of vessels and\r\nmen required for this purpose, the most advantageous points of\r\nattack, and the best season in which this can be carried into\r\nexecution. After all these matters have been determined upon, the\r\noperation in question ought to be connected with the other partial\r\nand general arrangements of the government, in order that a plan the\r\nbest adapted to localities and existing circumstances may be chosen,\r\nand without its being necessary to wait for the king's approbation\r\nof the means resolved upon, owing to the distance of the court and\r\nthe necessity of acting with celerity. If, however, on account of\r\nthe deference in every respect due to the sovereign, it should be\r\nthought proper to reconcile his previous sanction with the necessity\r\nof acting without loss of time, the best mode would be to send from\r\nSpain an officer of high rank, fully authorized, who, as practised\r\non other occasions, might give his sanction, in the name of the king,\r\nto the resolutions adopted by the council of war, and take under his\r\nown immediate charge, if it should be so deemed expedient, the command\r\nof the expedition against Jolo, receiving the appointment of governor\r\nof the Island, as soon as the conquest should be carried into effect,\r\nas a just reward for his zeal and valor.\r\n\r\n[War popular in Philippines.] Supposing an uniformity of opinions to\r\nprevail with regard to the expediency of attempting the subjugation\r\nof Jolo, and supposing also the existence of the necessary funds to\r\nmeet the expenses of a corresponding armament, it may be positively\r\nrelied upon that the project would be extremely popular, and meet\r\nwith the entire concurrence and support of the Philippine Islands. The\r\nmilitary men, aware of the great riches known to exist in the proposed\r\ntheatre of operations, would emulously come forward to offer their\r\nservices, under a hope of sharing the booty, and the warlike natives\r\nof the Bisayas would be impelled on by their hatred to the Moros,\r\nand their ardent wishes to avenge the blood of their fathers and\r\nchildren. On the other hand, the abundance of regular and well\r\ndisciplined officers and troops, at present in the colony and the\r\nnumber of gun-boats found in the ports, a want of which, on other\r\noccasions, has always been experienced, will afford ample scope for\r\nthe equipment of a force competent to the important enterprise in\r\nview. In fact, if the operation is arranged in a systematic manner,\r\nand all the precautions and rules observed as are usual in cases of\r\nattacks premeditated against European and civilized establishments,\r\nthere is no reason to expect any other than a flattering and decisive\r\nresult, since, in reality, the whole would be directed against an\r\nenemy contemptible on account of his barbarism and his comparative\r\nignorance of the art of war.\r\n\r\n[Native assistance.] The preparations deemed necessary being made in\r\nManila, and the Bisayan auxiliaries assembled beforehand in Zamboanga,\r\nwith their arms and respective chiefs, the whole of the operation\r\nin question, it may be safely said, might be terminated within the\r\nperiod of three or four months. Supposing even 2,000 regular troops\r\nare destined for this expedition, with a corresponding train of field\r\npieces, and at the moment there should not be found in the Islands a\r\nsufficient number of larger vessels to embargo or freight for their\r\nconveyance, a competent quantity of coasters, galleys and small craft\r\nmight be met with at any time sufficiently capacious and secure to\r\ncarry the men. This substitute will be found the less inconvenient,\r\nbecause, as the navigation is to be performed among the Islands during\r\nthe prevalence of the north winds, usually a favorable and steady\r\nseason of the year, the voyage will consequently be safe and easy. It\r\nwill also be possible to arrive at the point agreed upon, as a general\r\nrendezvous, in twenty, or five-and-twenty days, which place, for many\r\nreasons, ought to be the fortress of Zamboanga, situated in front of\r\nJolo and at moderate distance from that Island; it being from this port\r\nthat, in former times, the Philippine governors usually sent out their\r\narmaments, destined to make war against the Basilanese and Jolonese.\r\n\r\n[Mindanao also needs attention.] As soon as this important and\r\nmemorable enterprise has been carried into effect, and the punishment\r\nand total subjugation of these faithless Mahometans completed and\r\nthe new conquest placed under a military authority, in the mean\r\ntime that the lands are distributing and arrangements making to\r\nestablish the civil administration, on the same plan followed in the\r\nother provinces of the Philippine government, the armament ought to\r\nreturn to Zamboanga with all possible speed; but, after stopping by\r\nthe way to reduce the small island of Basilan and leaving a fortress\r\nand garrison there. Immediately afterwards, and before the various\r\ntribes of Moros inhabiting the Island of Mindanao have been able to\r\nconcert among themselves and prepare for their defence, it would\r\nbe advisable to direct partial expeditions towards both flanks of\r\nZamboanga, for the purpose of burning the settlements of the natives\r\nand driving them from the shores into the interior. Forts ought then\r\nto be raised at the mouths of the inlets and rivers, and a fourth\r\ndistrict government formed in the southern part of the island; in such\r\nmanner that, by possession being taken of the coasts, the government\r\nand district of Zamboanga may be placed in contact with the new\r\none established on the one side, and on the other with the district\r\nof Misamis, also the new district with that of Caraga, the western\r\npart of which territory is already united to that of Misamis. Such,\r\nat least, was the opinion of Lieutenant-Colonel Don Mariano Tobias,\r\nan officer deservedly celebrated for his prudence and consummate skill\r\nin these matters, and this he substantially expressed in a council\r\nof war, held on August 28, 1778, for the purpose of deliberating on\r\nthe most advisable means to check the Moros, as appears by a long\r\nand intelligent report drawn upon this subject on April 26, 1800,\r\nby the adjutant-general of this colony, Don Rufino Suarez.\r\n\r\nIn case it should be determined to adopt the means proposed by Colonel\r\nTobias, for the purpose of holding the Moros of Mindanao in check,\r\nand to which, unfortunately, due regard has not hitherto been paid,\r\nnotwithstanding the enterprise presents very few difficulties, owing\r\nto the little opposition to be expected from the infidel natives,\r\nthe latter would then be left completely surrounded and shut up in\r\nthe heart of the island, and their active system of privateering,\r\nwith which they have so many years infested these seas, entirely\r\ndestroyed. If, through the want of garrisons and population, it should\r\nnot, however, be possible to deprive them of all their outlets, by\r\nwhich means they would still be able occasionally to send some of\r\ntheir cruising vessels, nevertheless there would be facilities with\r\nwhich it would be possible to pursue and counteract the ravages of\r\nthe few pirates who might furtively escape out of some river, while\r\nnow they are fitted out, and well manned and armed to the number of\r\none and two hundred war-boats, openly in their ports.\r\n\r\n[A plan for future policing.] After the emporiums of slavery have\r\nbeen destroyed by the conquest of Jolo, and the other general\r\nmeasures adopted, as above pointed out, the government would then\r\nbe in a situation to turn its attention, with much greater ease,\r\nto the arrangement of all the other minor schemes of precaution and\r\nprotection suited to the difference of circumstances and locality,\r\nwithout the concurrence of which the work would be left imperfect,\r\nand in some degree the existence of those settled in the new\r\nestablishments rendered precarious. As, however, I am unprepared\r\nminutely to point out the nature of these measures, or distinctly\r\nto lay down a ground-work for future civilization and improvement,\r\nI shall merely observe, that what would then remain to be done would\r\nneither require any great capital, or present obstacles which might\r\nnot easily be overcome. The Moros being then concentrated in the\r\nIsland of Mindanao, and this completely surrounded on all sides by our\r\nforts and settlements, in the manner above described, the only enemies\r\nlet loose on these seas would be either the few who might, from time\r\nto time, elude the vigilance of our troops and district-commanders,\r\nor those who might have escaped from Jolo previous to its conquest,\r\nand taken up their abode in one or other of the Bisayas Islands; or,\r\nin short, such as are out cruising at the time our armament returns\r\nto Zamboanga and takes possession of the southern coast of Mindanao;\r\nin which case they would be compelled to resort to a roving life,\r\nestablishing, like the Jolo fugitives, temporary dwellings among the\r\nmangroves and thickets bordering on the shore.\r\n\r\nThe principal objects then remaining for the attention of government\r\nwould be to guard and protect the towns and settlements established\r\non the coasts from the insults and inroads of banditti, impelled by\r\nnecessity or despair, and at the same time to promote the gradual\r\noverthrow or civilization of the dispersed remnant of Moorish\r\npopulation left in the Island. The cruising of the pirates being\r\nthus reduced to a space comprehended in an oblong circle formed by\r\nan imaginary line drawn from the southern extreme of the Island of\r\nLeyte, to the south-west point of Samar, which next running along\r\nthe north-west coast of Mindoro, on the outside of Tacao and Burias,\r\nand coming down to the west of Panay, Negros and Bohol, closes the\r\noval at the little island formed by the Strait of Panaon, about forty\r\ngunboats might be advantageously stationed in the narrowest passages\r\nfrom land to land; as, for example, in the Strait of San Juanico and\r\nother passes of a similar kind, well known to the local pilots. By this\r\nmeans, the limits would be gradually contracted. Various small naval\r\narmaments ought, at the same time, to keep cruising in the center\r\nof this circle, pursuing the Moros by sea and land, dislodging them\r\nfrom their strongholds and lurking places, and sending on those who\r\nmight be captured to the depot pointed out by government.\r\n\r\n[Feasibility of plans.] The first part of the plan would be the\r\nmore easily realized, as it is well-known that most of the districts\r\ncorresponding to the Bisayan tribes, including those of Camarines and\r\nAlbay, situated at the extremity of the island of Luzon, have several\r\ngunboats of their own, which might be used with great advantage. By\r\nmerely advancing and stationing them in such channels as the Moros\r\nmust necessarily pass, either in going out or returning, according to\r\nthe different monsoons, they would easily be checked, without removing\r\nthe gunboats to any great distance from their own coasts. As besides\r\nthe great advantages resulting from this plan and every one doing\r\nhis duty are apparent, no doubt numbers of natives would volunteer\r\ntheir services, more particularly if they were liberally rewarded,\r\nand their maintenance provided from the funds of the respective\r\ncommunities. Moreover, the points which at first should not be\r\nconsidered as sufficiently guarded might be strengthened by the king's\r\ngunboats, and, indeed, in all of them it would be advisable to station\r\nsome of the latter, commanded by a select officer, to whose orders\r\nthe captains of the provincial gunboats ought to be made subservient.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second part, it will suffice to observe that the\r\ncaptain-generalship of the Philippine Islands already possesses as\r\nmany as seventy gunboats, besides a considerable number of gallies\r\nand launches, which altogether constitute a formidable squadron\r\nof light vessels; and, after deducting those deemed necessary for\r\nthe protection of Jolo and the new province to be established in\r\nMindanao, a sufficient number would still be left to carry into\r\nexecution all the objects proposed. At present, although the Moros\r\nnavigate in numerous divions, and with a confidence inspired by their\r\nundisturbed prosperity, a 24-pounder shot from one of our launches is\r\nnevertheless sufficient to put them to flight; what therefore may not\r\nbe expected when their forces shall be so greatly diminished and their\r\napprehensions increased, of being defeated and captured? Nevertheless,\r\nas it is not easy for our gunboats to come up with them, when giving\r\nchase, it would be advisable to add to our cruisers a temporary\r\nestablishment of prows and light vessels, manned by Bisayan Indians,\r\nwhich, by advancing on with the gallies, might attack the enemy and\r\ngive time for the gunboats to come up and decide the action. Besides as\r\nthe Bisayan Indians are perfectly acquainted with the mode of making\r\nwar on the Moros, the meaning of their signals and manoeuvers and\r\nthe kind of places on shore in which they take shelter when pursued\r\nat sea, the employment of such auxiliaries would be extremely useful.\r\n\r\n[Need of undivided leadership.] The whole of these defensive and\r\noffensive arrangements would, however, be ineffectual or incomplete\r\nin their results, if the most perfect union and concert is not\r\nestablished in every part, so that all should conspire to the same\r\nobject, although by distinct means. In order therefore that the\r\nnecessary harmony may be secured, it would be expedient to remove the\r\nchief authority nearer to the theater of war, by confiding all the\r\nnecessary instructions and powers to the person who might be selected\r\nfor the direction and command of the enterprise, after the general\r\nplan of operations had been regularly approved. Under this impression,\r\nand with a view to the better execution of all the details, it would\r\nbe advisable for the commanding officer, named by the government,\r\nto take up his headquarters in the Island of Panay, which, owing to\r\nits geographical situation, the great number of towns and inhabitants\r\ncontained in the three provinces into which it is divided, as well\r\nas other political reasons, is generally esteemed preferable for the\r\nobject in question, to the Island of Zebu, where, in former times,\r\nthe commanders of the province of the painted natives resided,\r\nas mentioned in the laws of the Indies. The center of action being\r\nplaced in Iloilo, a communication with the other points would thus\r\nmore easily be kept open, aid and relief might be sent more rapidly\r\nto the quarter where required, and, in a word, all the movements,\r\nof whatsoever kind they might be, would be executed with greater\r\nprecision and certainty of success. It would be unnecessary to\r\nadd that the provincial magistrates of Camarines and Albay ought to\r\nco-operate, with their fourteen gunboats and other smaller vessels, in\r\nthe measures adopted by the commander of the Bisayan establishment,\r\ndistributing their forces according to the orders given by him,\r\nand by undertaking to guard the straits of San Bernardino.\r\n\r\n[Paragua.] The Island of Paragua, at the head of which the\r\nprovincial jurisdiction of Calamianes is placed, is not included\r\nin the great circle, or chain of stations, above traced out, as\r\nwell in consequence of its great distance from the other islands,\r\nfor which reason it is not so much infested by the Moros, as because\r\nof its being at present nearly depopulated and uncultivated, and for\r\nthese reasons the attention of government ought not to be withdrawn\r\nfrom other more important points. With regard to that of Mindanao,\r\nthe necessity of keeping up along the whole of its immense coast, a\r\nline of castles and watch towers, has already been fully pointed out,\r\nmore especially in the vicinity of the bay of Panguil, to the north,\r\nand the mouths of the great river towards the south; the two points\r\nin which the enemies' most formidable armaments are usually fitted\r\nout. Consequently, it would not be possible to expect the provincial\r\ncommanders stationed there would be able to disengage any part of\r\ntheir naval force, in order to place it at the disposal of the officer\r\ncommanding the Bisayan vessels. Indeed, it is obvious that it would be\r\nextremely important to afford the people of Mindanao every possible\r\nadditional aid, in vessels, troops and money, in order the better to\r\ncheck the sailing of partial divisions of the enemy, and thus prevent\r\nthe immense number of pirates, inhabiting the interior of the island,\r\nfrom breaking the fortified line, and again covering these seas, and\r\nwith redoubled fury carrying death and desolation along all the coasts.\r\n\r\nIt would, in fact, be extremely desirable if, through the concerted\r\nmeasures and constant vigilance of the four chief magistrates\r\nintrusted with the command of the island, the future attempts of\r\nthe Mindanayans could be entirely counteracted, and their cruisers\r\naltogether kept within the line for a certain period of years; as by\r\nthus depriving them of the facilities to continue their old habits\r\nof life, these barbarous tribes would be eventually compelled to\r\nadopt other pursuits, either by ascending the mountainous parts of\r\nthe island, and shutting themselves up in the thick and impenetrable\r\nforests, with a view to preserve their independence; or, throwing\r\ndown their arms and devoting themselves to the peaceful cultivation\r\nof their lands. In the latter case, they would gradually lose their\r\npresent ferocious character; their regard for the conveniences and\r\nrepose of social life would increase; the contrast would be attended\r\nwith most favorable consequences, and in the course of time, the whole\r\nof the aboriginal natives of these islands would come into our laws\r\nand customs, and become confounded in the general mass of Philippine\r\nsubjects, owing allegiance to the king.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be equally acknowledged that the Islands of Jolo,\r\nBasilan, Capul, and some of the other inferior ones, of which,\r\nas above pointed out, an union ought to be formed in the way of an\r\nadditional government, subordinate to the captain-general, would be\r\nable to co-operate in the war on no other plan than the one traced\r\nout for the provinces held in Mindanao; that is, by their gunboats\r\nbeing confided to the protection of their own coasts; though with\r\nthis difference, that if, in one instance, the main object would be\r\nto prevent the evasion of the enemy, in the other every effort must\r\nbe employed to guard against and repel their incursions when they\r\ndo appear. However complete the success of the armament, destined\r\nfor the reduction of Jolo, it may nevertheless be presumed, that the\r\nmountains would still continue to give shelter to hordes of fugitives,\r\nwho would take refuge in the fastnesses, and avail themselves of every\r\nopportunity to concert plans, or fly off to join their comrades in\r\nMindanao, in order to return, and through their aid, satisfy their\r\nthirst for vengeance, by surprising some fortress or settlement,\r\nor establishing themselves on some neglected and not well known\r\npoint. In consequence of this, the governor, commanding there,\r\nwould at first require the active co-operation of all his forces,\r\nfor the purpose of consolidating the new conquest, and causing his\r\nauthority to be respected throughout the island.\r\n\r\n[Importance of peace for Philippine progress.] These, in my opinion,\r\nare the true and secure means by which the enemies of the peace\r\nand prosperity of the Philippines may be humbled, their piracies\r\nprevented, and a basis laid for the future civilization of the\r\nremaining islands in this important Archipelago. To this sketch,\r\na number of other details and essential illustrations, no doubt,\r\nare wanting; and possibly, I may be accused of some inaccuracies, in\r\ndiscussing a topic, with which I candidly avow I cannot be considered\r\naltogether familiar. The plan and success of the enterprise must,\r\nhowever, greatly depend on military skill and talent; but as I have\r\nattempted no more than fairly to trace the general outline of the\r\nplan, and insist on the necessity of its adoption, my remarks, it\r\nis to be hoped, will serve to awaken a serious disposition to review\r\nand investigate the whole subject, a task that most assuredly ought\r\nto be confided to a competent and special council. Whatever defects\r\nI may involuntarily have fallen into, will then be corrected; at the\r\nsame time it ought not to appear strange that inexperienced persons\r\nshould presume to speak on matters connected with the public good,\r\nwhen we see them so much neglected by those whose more immediate duty\r\nit is to look after and promote them. At all events, dispassionate\r\nzeal has seldom done harm; and I again repeat, that my wish is not\r\nso much to see my own ideas adopted, as to urge the necessity of\r\ntheir being examined and digested. I am desirous that other sources\r\nof information on this subject should be explored, that practical men\r\nshould be called in, and that those in power should be induced to apply\r\nthemselves and devote their exertions to an object so highly deserving\r\nof their attention. In short, I am anxious that the pious injunctions\r\nof our monarchs should be fulfilled, and that the tears and blood of\r\nthe inhabitants of these neglected islands should cease to flow.\r\n\r\nShould the happy day ever arrive, when the inhabitants of these\r\nprovinces shall behold themselves free from the cruel scourge with\r\nwhich they have been desolated for so many years, they will bless the\r\nnation that has redeemed them from all their cares, they will tighten\r\ntheir relations with it, and deliver themselves up to its direction\r\nwithout reserve. The natives will then come down from the strong\r\nfastnesses they at present inhabit; they will clear fresh lands, and\r\nearnestly devote themselves to tillage and industry. Under the shadow\r\nof peace, population and commerce will increase; the Bisayan vessels\r\nwill then plough the ocean without the dread of other enemies than\r\nthe elements; and the Moros themselves of Mindanao (I say it with\r\nconfidence), straightened on all sides, and incessantly harassed\r\nby the Christians, but on the other hand witnessing the advantages\r\nand mildness of our laws, will at length submit to the dominion of\r\nthe monarchs of Spain, who will thus secure the quiet possession of\r\none of the most interesting portions of the habitable globe, and be\r\njustly entitled to the gratitude of all nations connected with China\r\nand India, for having put an end to a series of the most terrific\r\nplunder and captivity that ever disgraced the annals of any age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nManila in 1842\r\n\r\nBy Com. Charles Wilkes, U.S.N.\r\n\r\n(Narrative of U. S. Exploring Expedition, Vol. V, Chaps. 8 and 9.)\r\n\r\n[Port rules.] At daylight, on January 13, we were again under way,\r\nwith a light air, and at nine o'clock reached the roadstead, where we\r\nanchored in six fathoms water, with good holding-ground. Being anxious\r\nto obtain our letters, which, we were informed at Oahu, had been sent\r\nto Manila, I immediately dispatched two boats to procure them. On\r\ntheir way to the mole, they were stopped by the captain of the port,\r\nDon Juan Salomon, who requested them, in a polite manner, to return,\r\nand informed the officers that, agreeably to the rules of the port,\r\nno boat was permitted to land until the visit of the health-officer\r\nhad been made, etc.\r\n\r\n[Official courtesies.] The captain of the port, in a large barge,\r\nwas soon seen pulling off in company with the boats. He boarded us\r\nwith much ceremony, and a few moments sufficed to satisfy him of\r\nthe good health of the crew, when he readily gave his assent to\r\nour visiting the shore. Every kind of assistance was offered me,\r\non the part of the government, and he, in the most obliging manner,\r\ngave us permission to go and come when we pleased, with the simple\r\nrequest that the boats should wear our national flag, that they might\r\nat all times be known, and thus be free from any interruption by the\r\nguards. The boats were again dispatched for the consul and letters,\r\nand after being anxiously watched for, returned; every one on board\r\nship expecting his wishes to be gratified with news from home; but,\r\nas is usual on such occasions, the number of the happy few bore no\r\ncomparison to that of the many who were disappointed.\r\n\r\nOur vice-consul, Josiah Moore, Esq., soon paid us a visit, and gave\r\nus a pressing invitation to take up our quarters on shore while we\r\nremained. To this gentleman and Mr. Sturges I am greatly indebted for\r\nmuch of the information that will be detailed in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n[American hemp ships.] A number of vessels were lying in the roads,\r\namong which were several Americans loading with hemp. There was also a\r\nlarge English East Indiaman, manned by Lascars, whose noise rendered\r\nher more like a floating Bedlam than any thing else to which I can\r\nliken it.\r\n\r\n[A Spanish oriental city.] The view of the city and country around\r\nManila partakes both of a Spanish and an Oriental character. The\r\nsombre and heavy-looking churches, with their awkward towers; the long\r\nlines of batteries mounted with heavy cannon; the massive houses,\r\nwith ranges of balconies; and the light and airy cottage, elevated\r\non posts, situated in the luxuriant groves of tropical trees--all\r\nexcite a desire to become better acquainted with the country.\r\n\r\n[Surroundings.] Manila is situated on an extensive plain, gradually\r\nswelling into distant hills, beyond which, again, mountains rise in\r\nthe back ground to the height of several thousand feet. The latter\r\nare apparently clothed with vegetation to their summits. The city is\r\nin strong contrast to this luxuriant scenery, bearing evident marks\r\nof decay, particularly in the churches, whose steeples and tile roofs\r\nhave a dilapidated look. The site of the city does not appear to have\r\nbeen well chosen, it having apparently been selected entirely for\r\nthe convenience of commerce, and the communication that the outlet\r\nof the lake affords for the batteaux that transport the produce from\r\nthe shores of the Laguna de Bay to the city.\r\n\r\n[Canals.] There are many arms or branches to this stream, which have\r\nbeen converted into canals; and almost any part of Manila may now be\r\nreached in a banca.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, in company with Captain Hudson, I paid my first visit\r\nto Manila. The anchorage considered safest for large ships is nearly\r\nthree miles from the shore, but smaller vessels may lie much nearer,\r\nand even enter the canal; a facility of which a number of these take\r\nadvantage, to accomplish any repairs they may have occasion to make.\r\n\r\n[Typhoons.] The canal, however, is generally filled with coasting\r\nvessels, batteaux from the lake, and lighters for the discharge of\r\nthe vessels lying in the roads. The bay of Manila is safe, excepting\r\nduring the change of the monsoons, when it is subject to the typhoons\r\nof the China Seas, within whose range it lies. These blow at times with\r\nmuch force, and cause great damage. Foreign vessels have, however,\r\nkept this anchorage, and rode out these storms in safety; but native\r\nas well as Spanish vessels, seek at these times the port of Cavite,\r\nabout three leagues to the southwest, at the entrance of the bay,\r\nwhich is perfectly secure. Here the government dockyard is situated,\r\nand this harbor is consequently the resort of the few gunboats and\r\ngalleys that are stationed here.\r\n\r\n[Twin piers.] The entrance to the canal or river Pasig is three hundred\r\nfeet wide, and is enclosed between two well-constructed piers, which\r\nextend for some distance into the bay. On the end of one of these is\r\nthe light-house, and on the other a guard-house. The walls of these\r\npiers are about four feet above ordinary high water, and include the\r\nnatural channel of the river, whose current sets out with some force,\r\nparticularly when the ebb is making in the bay.\r\n\r\n[Suburbs.] The suburbs, or Binondo quarter, contain more inhabitants\r\nthan the city itself, and is the commercial town. They have all the\r\nstir and life incident to a large population actively engaged in trade,\r\nand in this respect the contrast with the city proper is great.\r\n\r\n[Walled city.] The city of Manila is built in the form of a large\r\nsegment of a circle, having the chord of the segment on the river:\r\nthe whole is strongly fortified, with walls and ditches. The houses\r\nare substantially built after the fashion of the mother country. Within\r\nthe walls are the governor's palace, custom-house, treasury, admiralty,\r\nseveral churches, convents, and charitable institutions, a university,\r\nand the barracks for the troops; it also contains some public squares,\r\non one of which is a bronze statue of Charles IV.\r\n\r\nThe city is properly deemed the court residence of these islands; and\r\nall those attached to the government, or who wish to be considered as\r\nof the higher circle, reside here; but foreigners are not permitted\r\nto do so. The houses in the city are generally of stone, plastered,\r\nand white or yellow washed on the outside. They are only two stories\r\nhigh, and in consequence cover a large space, being built around a\r\npatio or courtyard.\r\n\r\n[Dwellings.] The ground-floors are occupied as storehouses,\r\nstables, and for porters' lodges. The second story is devoted to\r\nthe dining-halls and sleeping apartments, kitchens, bath-rooms,\r\netc. The bed-rooms have the windows down to the floor, opening on wide\r\nbalconies, with blinds or shutters. These blinds are constructed with\r\nsliding frames, having small squares of two inches filled in with\r\na thin semi-transparent shell, a species of Placuna; the fronts of\r\nsome of the houses have a large number of these small lights, where\r\nthe females of the family may enjoy themselves unperceived.\r\n\r\n[Business.] After entering the canal, we very soon found ourselves\r\namong a motley and strange population. On landing, the attention is\r\ndrawn to the vast number of small stalls and shops with which the\r\nstreets are lined on each side, and to the crowds of people passing\r\nto and fro, all intent upon their several occupations. The artisans in\r\nManila are almost wholly Chinese; and all trades are local, so that in\r\neach quarter of the Binondo suburb the privilege of exclusive occupancy\r\nis claimed by some particular kinds of shops. In passing up the\r\nEscolta (which is the longest and main street in this district), the\r\ncabinet-makers, seen busily at work in their shops, are first met with;\r\nnext to these come the tinkers and blacksmiths; then the shoe-makers,\r\nclothiers, fishmongers, haberdashers, etc. These are flanked by outdoor\r\noccupations; and in each quarter are numerous cooks, frying cakes,\r\nstewing, etc., in movable kitchens; while here and there are to be\r\nseen betel-nut sellers, either moving about to obtain customers,\r\nor taking a stand in some great thoroughfare. The moving throng,\r\ncomposed of carriers, waiters, messengers, etc., pass quietly and\r\nwithout any noise: they are generally seen with the Chinese umbrella,\r\npainted in many colors, screening themselves from the sun. The whole\r\npopulation wear slippers, and move along with a slipshod gait.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are apparently far more numerous than the Malays, and the\r\ntwo races differ as much in character as in appearance: one is all\r\nactivity, while the other is disposed to avoid all exertion. They\r\npreserve their distinctive character throughout, mixing but very\r\nlittle with each other, and are removed as far as possible in their\r\ncivilities; the former, from their industry and perseverance, have\r\nalmost monopolized all the lucrative employments among the lower\r\norders, excepting the selling of fish and betel-nut, and articles\r\nmanufactured in the provinces.\r\n\r\nOn shore, we were kindly received by Mr. Moore, who at once made us\r\nfeel at home. The change of feeling that takes place in a transfer from\r\nshipboard in a hot climate, after a long cruise, to spacious and airy\r\napartments, surrounded by every luxury that kind attentions can give,\r\ncan be scarcely imagined by those who have not experienced it.\r\n\r\nAs we needed some repairs and supplies, to attend to these was\r\nmy first occupation. Among the former, we required a heavy piece\r\nof blacksmith-work, to prepare which, we were obliged to send our\r\narmourers on shore. The only thing they could procure was a place for\r\na forge; but coal, and every thing else, we had to supply from the\r\nship. I mention these things to show that those in want of repairs\r\nmust not calculate upon their being done at Manila with dispatch,\r\nif they can be accomplished at all.\r\n\r\n[City of Manila.] The city government of Manila was established\r\nJune 24, 1571, and the title under which it is designated is, \"The\r\ncelebrated and forever loyal city of Manila.\" In 1595, the charter\r\nwas confirmed by royal authority; and all the prerogatives possessed\r\nby other cities in the kingdom were conferred upon it in 1638. The\r\nmembers of the city council, by authority of the king, were constituted\r\na council of advisement with the governor and captain-general. The\r\ncity magistrates were also placed in rank next the judges; and in\r\n1686 the jurisdiction of the city was extended over a radius of five\r\nleagues. In 1818, the members of the council were increased and ordered\r\nto assume the title of \"Excellency.\" Manila has been one of the most\r\nconstantly loyal cities of the Spanish kingdom, and is, in consequence,\r\nconsidered to merit these additional royal favors to its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Commerce.] In 1834, the Royal Tribunal of Commerce was instituted,\r\nto supersede the old consulate, which had been established since 1772,\r\nThe Royal Tribunal of Commerce acts under the new commercial code, and\r\npossesses the same privileges of arbitration as the old consulate. It\r\nconsists of a prior, two consuls, and four deputies, elected by the\r\nprofession. The three first exercise consular jurisdiction, the other\r\nfour superintend the encouragement of commerce. The \"Junta de Comercio\"\r\n(chamber of commerce) was formed in 1835. This junta consits of the\r\nTribunal of Commerce, with four merchants, who are selected by the\r\ngovernment, two of whom are removed annually. The prior of the Tribunal\r\npresides at the Junta, whose meetings are required to be held twice a\r\nmonth, or oftener if necessary, and upon days in which the Tribunal\r\nis not in session. The two courts being under the same influences,\r\nand having the same officers, little benefit is to be derived from\r\ntheir double action, and great complaints are made of the manner in\r\nwhich business is conducted in them.\r\n\r\n[Magellan.] Of all her foreign possessions, the Philippines have\r\ncost Spain the least blood and labor. The honor of their discovery\r\nbelongs to Magellan whose name is associated with the straits at\r\nthe southern extremity of the American continent, but which has\r\nno memorial in these islands. Now that the glory which he gained\r\nby being the first to penetrate from the Atlantic to the Pacific,\r\nhas been in some measure obliterated by the disuse of those straits\r\nby navigators, it would seem due to his memory that some spot among\r\nthese islands should be set apart to commemorate the name of, him\r\nwho made them known to Europe. This would be but common justice to\r\nthe discoverer of a region which has been a source of so much honor\r\nand profit to the Spanish nation, who opened the vast expanse of the\r\nPacific to the fleets of Europe, and who died fighting to secure the\r\nbenefits of his enterprise to his king and country.\r\n\r\nMagellan was killed at the island of Mactan, on April 26, 1521;\r\nand Duarte, the second in command, who succeeded him, imprudently\r\naccepting an invitation from the chief of Cebu to a feast, was, with\r\ntwenty companions, massacred. Of all the Spaniards present, only one\r\nescaped. After these and various other misfortunes, only one vessel\r\nof the squadron, the Victoria, returned to Spain. Don Juan Sebastian\r\ndel Cano, her commander, was complimented by his sovereign by a grant\r\nfor his arms of a globe, with the proud inscription, commemorative\r\nof his being the first circumnavigator, \"Primus Me Circumcedit.\"\r\n\r\n[Other expeditions.] Two years afterwards, a second expedition was\r\nfitted out, under the command of Loaisa, who died after they had\r\npassed through the Straits of Magellan, when they had been a year\r\non their voyage. The command then fell upon Sebastian, who died in\r\nfour days after his predecessor. Salazar succeeded to the command,\r\nand reached the Ladrone Islands, but shortly after leaving there\r\nhe died also. They came in sight of Mindanao, but contrary winds\r\nobliged them to go to the Moluccas. When arrived at the Portuguese\r\nsettlements, contentions and jealousies arose, and finally all the\r\nexpedition was dispersed, and the fate of all but one of the vessels\r\nhas become doubtful. None but the small tender returned, which,\r\nafter encountering great difficulties, reached New Spain.\r\n\r\nThe third expedition was fitted out by Cortes, then viceroy of Mexico,\r\nand the command of it given to Saavedra. This sailed from the port\r\nof Silguattanjo, on the 31st of October, 1528, and stopped at the\r\nLadrone Islands, of which it took possession for the crown of Spain. It\r\nafterwards went to Mindanao, and then pursued its voyage to Timor,\r\nwhere part of the expedition of Loaisa was found remaining. From\r\nTimor they made two attempts to return to New Spain, both of which\r\nfailed. The climate soon brought on disease, which carried off a great\r\nnumber, and among them Saavedra. Thus the whole expedition was broken\r\nup, and the survivors found their way to the Portuguese settlements.\r\n\r\nThe fourth expedition was sent from New Spain, when under the\r\ngovernment of Don Antonio de Mendoza, for the purpose of establishing\r\na trade with the new islands, and it received orders not to visit\r\nthe Moluccas. This expedition sailed in 1542, under the command\r\nof Villalobos. It reached the Philippine Islands without accident,\r\nand Villalobos gave them that name after Philip II, then prince of\r\nAsturias. Notwithstanding his positive instructions to the contrary,\r\nhe was obliged to visit the Moluccas, and met the same treatment from\r\nthe Portuguese that had been given to all whom they believed had any\r\nintention to interfere in their spice trade. The squadron touched at\r\nAmboina, where Villalobos died, an event which caused the breaking\r\nup of the expedition; and the few Spaniards that remained embarked\r\nin the Portuguese vessels to return home.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and last expedition was ordered by Philip II to be sent\r\nfrom Mexico, when under the government of Don Luis de Velasco,\r\nfor the final conquest and settlement of the Philippines. With\r\nthis expedition was sent Andres Urdaneta, a friar, whose reputation\r\nstood very high as a cosmographer: he had belonged to the ill-fated\r\nexpedition of Loaisa. This was the largest that had yet been fitted\r\nout for this purpose, numbering five vessels and about four hundred\r\nmen. The command of it was intrusted to [Legaspi.] Legaspi, under\r\nwhom it sailed from the port of Natividad, on November 21, 1564, and\r\nupon whom was conferred the title of governor and adelantado of the\r\nconquered lands, with the fullest powers. On the 13th of February,\r\n1565, he arrived at the island of Tandaya, one of the Philippines:\r\nfrom thence he went to Leyte; there he obtained the son of a powerful\r\nchief as a guide, through whom he established peace with several of\r\nthe native rulers, who thereafter aided the expedition with all the\r\nmeans in their power. At Bohol they built the first church. There he\r\nmet and made peace with a chief of Luzon, with whom he went to that\r\nisland. (Facts here are confused.--C.)\r\n\r\nHe now (April, 1565) took possession of all the island in the name of\r\nthe crown of Spain, and became their first governor. In this conquest,\r\nmotives different from those which governed them on the American\r\ncontinent, seemed to have influenced the Spaniards. Instead of carrying\r\non a cruel war against the natives, they here pursued the policy of\r\nencouraging and fostering their industry. Whether they felt that this\r\npolicy was necessary for the success of their undertaking, or were\r\ninfluenced by the religious fathers who were with them, is uncertain;\r\nbut their measures seem to have been dictated by a desire to promote\r\npeace and secure the welfare of the inhabitants. There may be another\r\ncause for this course of action, namely, the absence of the precious\r\nmetals, which held out no inducement to those thirsting for inordinate\r\ngain. This may have had its weight in exempting the expedition in\r\nits outset from the presence of those avaricious spirits which had\r\naccompanied other Spanish expeditions, and been the means of marking\r\ntheir progress with excessive tyranny, bloodshed, and violence. It is\r\nevident to one who visits the Philippines that some other power besides\r\nthe sword has been at work in them; the natives are amalgamated with\r\nthe Spaniards, and all seem disposed to cultivate the land and foster\r\ncivilization. None of the feeling that grows out of conquest is to be\r\nobserved in these islands; the two races are identified now in habits,\r\nmanners, and religion, and their interests are so closely allied that\r\nthey feel their mutual dependence upon each other.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the new constitution in Spain in the year 1825\r\nhas had a wonderful effect upon these colonies, whose resources have\r\nwithin the last ten years been developed, and improvements pushed\r\nforward with a rapid step. Greater knowledge and more liberal views\r\nin the rulers are alone wanting to cause a still more rapid advance\r\nin the career of prosperity.\r\n\r\nAs our visit was to Luzon, we naturally obtained more personal\r\ninformation respecting it than the other islands. We learned that the\r\nnorthern peninsula [268] was composed of granite and recent volcanic\r\nrocks, together with secondary and tertiary deposits, while the\r\nsouthern peninsula is almost wholly volcanic.\r\n\r\nThe northern contains many valuable mines of gold, lead, copper,\r\nand iron, besides coal. A number of specimens of these, and the rocks\r\nwhich contain them, were presented to the Expedition by Señores Araria\r\nand Roxas of Manila.\r\n\r\nSo far as our information and observations went, the whole of the\r\nPhilippine Islands are of similar geological formation. In some of\r\nthe islands the volcanic rock prevails, while in others coal and the\r\nmetalliferous deposits predominate. On some of them the coal-beds\r\nform part of the cliffs along the shore; on others, copper is found\r\nin a chlorite and talcose slate. The latter is more particularly\r\nthe case with Luzon, and the same formation extends to Mindoro. Much\r\niron occurs on the mountains. Thus among the (Upland) natives, who\r\nare yet unsubdued by the Spaniards, and who inhabit these mountains,\r\nit is found by them of so pure a quality that it is manufactured\r\ninto swords and cleavers. These are, occasionally, obtained by the\r\nSpaniards in their excursions into the interior against these bands.\r\n\r\n[Tufa.] The country around Manila is composed of tufa of a light gray\r\ncolor, which being soft and easily worked, is employed as the common\r\nbuilding material in the city. It contains, sometimes, scoria and\r\npumice, in pieces of various sizes, besides, occasionally, impressions\r\nof plants, with petrified woods. These are confined to recent species,\r\nand include palms, etc.\r\n\r\nThis tufa forms one of the remarkable features of the volcanoes of the\r\nPhilippine Islands, showing a strong contrast between them and those of\r\nthe Pacific isles, which have ejected little else than lava and scoria.\r\n\r\nFew portions of the globe seem to be so much the seat of internal\r\nfires, or to exhibit the effects of volcanic action so strongly as\r\nthe Philippines. During our visit, it was not known that any of the\r\nvolcanoes were in action; but many of them were smoking, particularly\r\nthat in the district of Albay, called Isaroc. Its latest eruption\r\nwas in the year 1839; but this did little damage compared with\r\nthat of 1814, which covered several villages, and the country for a\r\ngreat distance around, with ashes. This mountain is situated to the\r\nsouth-east of Manila one hundred and fifty miles, and is said to be\r\na perfect cone, with a crater at its apex.\r\n\r\n[Resources.] It does not appear that the islands are much affected\r\nby earth-quakes, although some have occasionally occurred that have\r\ndone damage to the churches at Manila.\r\n\r\nThe coal which we have spoken of is deemed of value; it has a strong\r\nresemblance to the bituminous coal of our own country, possesses a\r\nbright lustre, and appears very free from all woody texture when\r\nfractured. It is found associated with sandstone, which contains\r\nmany fossils. Lead and copper are reported as being very abundant;\r\ngypsum and limestone occur in some districts. From this, it will\r\nbe seen that these islands have everything in the mineral way to\r\nconstitute them desirable possessions.\r\n\r\nWith such mineral resources, and a soil capable of producing the\r\nmost varied vegetation of the tropics, a liberal policy is all that\r\nthe country lacks. The products of the Philippine Islands consist\r\nof sugar, coffee, hemp, indigo, rice, tortoise-shell, hides, ebony,\r\nsaffron-wood, sulphur, cotton, cordage, silk, pepper, cocoa, wax,\r\nand many other articles. In their agricultural operations the\r\npeople are industrious, although much labor is lost by the use of\r\ndefective implements. The plough, of very simple construction, has\r\nbeen adopted from the Chinese; it has no coulter, the share is flat,\r\nand being turned partly to one side, answers, in a certain degree,\r\nthe purpose of a mould-board. This rude implement is sufficient for\r\nthe rich soils, where the tillage depends chiefly upon the harrow,\r\nin constructing which a thorny species of bamboo is used. The harrow\r\nis formed of five or six pieces of this material, on which the thorns\r\nare left, firmly fastened together. It answers its purpose well, and\r\nis seldom out of order. A wrought-iron harrow, that was introduced\r\nby the Jesuits, is used for clearing the ground more effectually,\r\nand more particularly for the purpose of extirpating a troublesome\r\ngrass, that is known by the name of cogon (a species of Andropogon), of\r\nwhich it is very difficult to rid the fields. The bolo or long-knife,\r\na basket, and hoe, complete the list of implements, and answer all\r\nthe purposes of our spades, etc.\r\n\r\n[Draft animals.] The buffalo was used until within a few years\r\nexclusively in their agricultural operations, and they have lately\r\ntaken to the use of the ox; but horses are never used. The buffalo,\r\nfrom the slowness of his motions, and his exceeding restlessness\r\nunder the heat of the climate, is ill adapted to agricultural labor;\r\nbut the natives are very partial to them, notwithstanding they\r\noccasion them much labor and trouble in bathing them during the great\r\nheat. This is absolutely necessary, or the animal becomes so fretful\r\nas to be unfit for use. If it were not for this, the buffalo would,\r\nnotwithstanding his slow pace, be most effective in agricultural\r\noperations; he requires little food, and that of the coarsest kind;\r\nhis strength surpasses that of the stoutest ox, and he is admirably\r\nadapted for the rice or paddy fields. They are very docile when used\r\nby the natives, and even children can manage them; but it is said they\r\nhave a great antipathy to the whites, and all strangers. The usual\r\nmode of guiding them is by a small cord attached to the cartilage of\r\nthe nose. The yoke rests on the neck before the shoulders, and is of\r\nsimple construction. To this is attached whatever it may be necessary\r\nto draw, either by traces, shafts, or other fastenings. Frequently this\r\nanimal may be seen with large bundles of bamboo lashed to them on each\r\nside. Buffaloes are to be met with on the lake with no more than their\r\nnoses and eyes out of the water, and are not visible until they are\r\napproached within a few feet, when they cause alarm to the passengers\r\nby raising their large forms close to the boat. It is said that they\r\nresort to the lake to feed on a favorite grass that grows on its bottom\r\nin shallow water, and which they dive for. Their flesh is not eaten,\r\nexcept that of the young ones, for it is tough and tasteless. The milk\r\nis nutritious, and of a character between that of the goat and cow.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the buffalo is that of a hybrid of the\r\nbull and rhinoceros. Its horns do not rise upwards, are very close\r\nat the root, bent backwards, and of a triangular form, with a flat\r\nside above. One of the peculiarities of the buffalo is its voice,\r\nwhich is quite low, and in the minor key, resembling that of a young\r\ncolt. It is as fond of mire as swine, and shows the consequence of\r\nrecent wallowing, in being crusted over with mud. The skin is visible,\r\nbeing but thinly covered with hair; its color is usually that of a\r\nmouse; in some individuals darker.\r\n\r\n[Rice.] Rice is, perhaps, of their agricultural products, the article\r\nupon which the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands most depend for\r\nfood and profit; of this they have several different varieties; which\r\nthe natives distinguish by their size and the shape of the grain:\r\nthe birnambang, lamuyo, malagequit, bontot-cabayo, dumali, quinanda,\r\nbolohan, and tangi. The three first are aquatic; the five latter\r\nupland varieties. They each have their peculiar uses. The dumali\r\nis the early variety; it ripens in three months from planting, from\r\nwhich circumstance it derives its name: it is raised exclusively on\r\nthe uplands. Although much esteemed, it is not extensively cultivated,\r\nas the birds and insects destroy a large part of the crop.\r\n\r\nThe malagequit is very much prized, and used for making sweet and\r\nfancy dishes; it becomes exceedingly glutinous, for which reason it\r\nis used in making whitewash, which it is said to cause to become of a\r\nbrilliant white, and to withstand the weather. This variety is not,\r\nhowever, believed to be wholesome. There is also a variety of this\r\nlast species which is used as food for horses, and supposed to be a\r\nremedy and preventive against worms.\r\n\r\nThe rice grounds or fields are laid out in squares, and surrounded by\r\nembankments, to retain the water of the rains or streams. After the\r\nrains have fallen in sufficient quantities to saturate the ground, a\r\nseed-bed is generally planted in one corner of the field, in which the\r\nrice is sown broadcast, about the month of June. The heavy rains take\r\nplace in August, when the fields are ploughed, and are soon filled with\r\nwater. The young plants are about this time taken from the seed-bed,\r\ntheir tops and roots trimmed, and then planted in the field by making\r\nholes in the ground with the fingers and placing four or five sprouts\r\nin each of them; in this tedious labor the poor women are employed,\r\nwhilst the males are lounging in their houses or in the shade of\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nThe harvest for the aquatic rice begins in December. It is reaped\r\nwith small sickles, peculiar to the country, called yatap; to the\r\nback of these a small stick is fastened, by which they are held,\r\nand the stalk is forced upon it and cut. The spikes of rice are\r\ncut with this implement, one by one. In this operation, men, women,\r\nand children all take part.\r\n\r\nThe upland rice requires much more care and labor in its\r\ncultivation. The land must be ploughed three or four times, and all\r\nthe turf and lumps well broken up by the harrow.\r\n\r\nDuring its growth it requires to be weeded two or three times, to\r\nkeep the weeds from choking the crop. The seed is sown broadcast in\r\nMay. This kind of rice is harvested in November, and to collect the\r\ncrop is still more tedious than in the other case, for it is always\r\ngathered earlier, and never reaped, in consequence of the grain not\r\nadhering to the ear. If it were gathered in any other way, the loss\r\nby transportation on the backs of buffaloes and horses, without any\r\ncovering to the sheaf, would be so great as to dissipate a great\r\nportion of the crop.\r\n\r\nIt appears almost incredible that any people can remain in\r\nignorance of a way of preventing so extravagant and wasteful a mode\r\nof harvesting. The government has been requested to prohibit it on\r\naccount of the great expense it gives rise to; but whether any steps\r\nhave ever been taken in the matter, I did not learn. It is said that\r\nnot unfrequently a third part of the crop is lost, in consequence of\r\nthe scarcity of laborers; while those who are disengaged will refuse\r\nto work, unless they receive one-third, and even one-half of the crop,\r\nto be delivered free of expense at their houses. This the planters\r\nare often obliged to give, or lose the whole crop. Nay, unless the\r\nharvest is a good one, reapers are very unwilling to engage to take it\r\neven on these terms, and the entire crop is lost. The laborers, during\r\nthe time of harvest, are supported by the planter, who is during that\r\ntime exposed to great vexation, if not losses. The reapers are for the\r\nmost part composed of the idle and vicious part of the population, who\r\ngo abroad over the country to engage themselves in this employment,\r\nwhich affords a livelihood to the poorer classes; for the different\r\nperiods at which the varieties of rice are planted and harvested,\r\ngives them work during a large portion of the year.\r\n\r\nAfter the rice is harvested, there are different modes of treating\r\nit. Some of the proprietors take it home, where it is thrown into\r\nheaps, and left until it is desirable to separate it from the straw,\r\nwhen it is trodden out by men and women with their bare feet. For\r\nthis operation, they usually receive another fifth of the rice.\r\n\r\nOthers stack it in a wet and green state, which subjects it to heat,\r\nfrom which cause the grain contracts a dark color, and an unpleasant\r\ntaste and smell. The natives, however, impute these defects to the\r\nwetness of the season.\r\n\r\nThe crop of both the low and upland rice, is usually from thirty\r\nto fifty for one: this is on old land; but on that which is newly\r\ncleared or which has never been cultivated, the yield is far beyond\r\nthis. In some soils of the latter description, it is said that for a\r\nchupa (seven cubic inches) planted, the yield has been a caban. The\r\nformer is the two-hundred-and-eighth part of the latter. This is not\r\nthe only advantage gained in planting rich lands, but the saving of\r\nlabor is equally great; for all that is required is to make a hole\r\nwith the fingers, and place three or four grains in it. The upland\r\nrice requires but little water, and is never irrigated.\r\n\r\nThe cultivator in the Philippine Islands is always enabled to secure\r\nplenty of manure; for vegetation is so luxuriant that by pulling the\r\nweeds and laying them with earth, a good stock is quickly obtained\r\nwith which to cover his fields. Thus, although the growth is so rank\r\nas to cause him labor, yet in this hot climate its decay is equally\r\nrapid, which tends to make his labors more successful.\r\n\r\nThe rice-stacks form a picturesque object on the field; they are\r\ngenerally placed around or near a growth of bamboo, whose tall,\r\ngraceful, and feathery outline is of itself a beautiful object,\r\nbut connected as it is often seen with the returns of the harvest,\r\nit furnishes an additional source of gratification.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of rice, and especially the upland, would no doubt\r\nbe an acquisition to our country. At the time we were at Manila, it\r\nwas not thought feasible to pack it, for it had just been reaped,\r\nand was so green that it would not have kept. [269] Although rice\r\nis a very prolific crop, yet it is subject to many casualties, from\r\nthe locusts and other insects that devour it; the drought at other\r\ntimes affects it, particularly the aquatic varieties. There is a use\r\nto which the rice is applied here, which was new to us, namely, as a\r\nsubstitute for razors; by using two grains of it between the fingers,\r\nthey nip the beard, or extract it from the chin and face.\r\n\r\n[Manila hemp.] Among the important productions of these islands, I have\r\nmentioned hemp, although the article called Manila hemp must not be\r\nunderstood to be derived from the plant which produces the common hemp\r\n(Cannabis), being obtained from a species of plantain (Musa textilis),\r\ncalled in the Philippines \"abacá.\" This is a native of these islands,\r\nand was formerly believed to be found only on Mindanao; but this is\r\nnot the case, for it is cultivated on the south part of Luzon, and\r\nall the islands south of it. It grows on high ground, in rich soil,\r\nand is propagated by seeds. It resembles the other plants of the tribe\r\nof plantains, but its fruit is much smaller, although edible. The\r\nfibre is derived from the stem, and the plant attains the height of\r\nfifteen or twenty feet. The usual mode of preparing the hemp is to cut\r\noff the stem near the ground, before the time or just when the fruit\r\nis ripe. The stem is then eight or ten feet long below the leaves,\r\nwhere it is again cut. The outer coating of the herbaceous stem\r\nis then stripped off, until the fibers or cellular parts are seen,\r\nwhen it undergoes the process of rotting, and after being well dried\r\nin houses and sheds, is prepared for market by assorting it, a task\r\nwhich is performed by the women and children. That which is intended\r\nfor cloth is soaked for an hour or two in weak lime-water prepared\r\nfrom sea-shells, again dried, and put up in bundles. From all the\r\ndistricts in which it grows, it is sent to Manila, which is the only\r\nport whence it can legally be exported. It arrives in large bundles,\r\nand is packed there, by means of a screw-press, in compact bales,\r\nfor shipping, secured by rattan, each weighing two piculs.\r\n\r\nThe best Manila hemp ought to be white, dry, and of a long and fine\r\nfiber. This is known at Manila by the name of lupis; the second\r\nquality they call bandala.\r\n\r\nThe exportation has much increased within the last few years, in\r\nconsequence of the demand for it in the United States; and the whole\r\ncrop is now monopolized by the two American houses of Sturges & Co.,\r\nand T. N. Peale & Co., of Manila, who buy all of good quality that\r\ncomes to market. This is divided between the two houses, and the\r\nprice they pay is from four to five dollars the picul. The entire\r\nquantity raised in 1840 was eighty-three thousand seven hundred and\r\nninety piculs; in 1841, eighty-seven thousand.\r\n\r\nThe quantity exported to the United States in 1840, was sixty-eight\r\nthousand two hundred and eighty piculs, and in 1841, only sixty-two\r\nthousand seven hundred piculs; its value in Manila is about three\r\nhundred thousand dollars. Twenty thousand piculs go to Europe. There\r\nare no duties on its exportation.\r\n\r\nThat which is brought to the United States is principally manufactured\r\nin or near Boston, and is the cordage known as \"white rope.\" The\r\ncordage manufactured at Manila is, however, very superior to the\r\nrope made with us, although the hemp is of the inferior kind. A large\r\nquantity is also manufactured into mats.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of our botanist, it is not probable that the plant could\r\nbe introduced with success into our country, for in the Philippines\r\nit is not found north of latitude 14° N.\r\n\r\n[Coffee.] The coffee-plant is well adapted to these islands. A\r\nfew plants were introduced into the gardens of Manila, about fifty\r\nyears ago, since which time it has been spread all over the island,\r\nas is supposed by the civet-cats, which, after swallowing the seeds,\r\ncarry them to a distance before they are voided.\r\n\r\nThe coffee of commerce is obtained here from the wild plant, and\r\nis of an excellent quality. Upwards of three thousand five hundred\r\npiculs are now exported, of which one-sixth goes to the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sugar.] The sugar-cane thrives well here. It is planted after the\r\nFrench fashion, by sticking the piece diagonally into the ground. Some,\r\nfinding the cane has suffered in times of drought, have adopted other\r\nmodes. It comes to perfection in a year, and they seldom have two\r\ncrops from the same piece of land, unless the season is very favorable.\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of cane cultivated, but that grown in the valley\r\nof Pampanga is thought to be the best. It is a small red variety, from\r\nfour to five feet high, and not thicker than the thumb. The manufacture\r\nof the sugar is rudely conducted; and the whole business, I was told,\r\nwas in the hands of a few capitalists, who, by making advances, secure\r\nthe whole crop from those who are employed to bring it to market. It\r\nis generally brought in moulds, of the usual conical shape, called\r\npilones, which are delivered to the purchaser from November to June,\r\nand contain each about one hundred and fifty pounds. On their receipt,\r\nthey are placed in large storehouses, where the familiar operation\r\nof claying is performed. The estimate for the quantity of sugar\r\nfrom these pilones after this process is about one hundred pounds;\r\nit depends upon the care taken in the process.\r\n\r\n[Cotton.] Of cotton they raise a considerable quantity, which is of a\r\nfine quality, and principally of the yellow nankeen. In the province\r\nof Ilocos it is cultivated most extensively. The mode of cleaning it\r\nof its seed is very rude, by means of a hand-mill, and the expense of\r\ncleaning a picul (one hundred and forty pounds) is from five to seven\r\ndollars. There have, as far as I have understood, been no endeavors\r\nto introduce any cotton-gins from our country.\r\n\r\n[Wages.] It will be merely necessary to give the prices at which\r\nlaborers are paid, to show how low the compensation is, in comparison\r\nwith those in our own country. In the vicinity of Manila, twelve and\r\na half cents per day is the usual wages; this in the provinces falls\r\nto six and nine cents. A man with two buffaloes is paid about thirty\r\ncents. The amount of labor performed by the latter in a day would\r\nbe the ploughing of a soane, about two-tenths of an acre. The most\r\nprofitable way of employing laborers is by the task, when, it is said,\r\nthe natives work well, and are industrious.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the sugar and other produce is brought to market\r\nat Manila is peculiar, and deserves to be mentioned. In some of the\r\nvillages, the chief men unite to build a vessel, generally a pirogue,\r\nin which they embark their produce, under the conduct of a few persons,\r\nwho go to navigate it, and dispose of the cargo. In due time they\r\nmake their voyage, and when the accounts are settled, the returns\r\nare distributed to each according to his share. Festivities are then\r\nheld, the saints thanked for their kindness, and blessings invoked\r\nfor another year. After this is over, the vessel is taken carefully\r\nto pieces, and distributed, among the owners, to be preserved for\r\nthe next season.\r\n\r\nThe profits in the crops, according to estimates, vary from sixty\r\nto one hundred per cent.; but it was thought, as a general average,\r\nthat this was, notwithstanding the great productiveness of the soil,\r\nfar beyond the usual profits accruing from agricultural operations. In\r\nsome provinces this estimate would hold good, and probably be exceeded.\r\n\r\n[Indigo.] Indigo would probably be a lucrative crop, for that raised\r\nhere is said to be of quality equal to the best, and the crop is\r\nnot subject to so many uncertainties as in India: the capital and\r\nattention required in vats, etc., prevent it from being raised in\r\nany quantities. Among the productions, the bamboo and rattan ought to\r\nclaim a particular notice from their great utility; they enter into\r\nalmost every thing. Of the former their houses are built, including\r\nframes, floors, sides, and roof; fences are made of the same material,\r\nas well as every article of general household use, including baskets\r\nfor oil and water. The rattan is a general substitute for ropes of\r\nall descriptions, and the two combined are used in constructing rafts\r\nfor crossing ferries.\r\n\r\nI have thus given a general outline of the capabilities of this\r\ncountry for agricultural operations, in some of the most important\r\narticles of commerce; by which it will be seen that the Philippine\r\nIslands are one of the most favored parts of the globe.\r\n\r\n[Locusts.] The crops frequently suffer from the ravages of the locusts,\r\nwhich sweep all before them. Fortunately for the poorer classes, their\r\nattacks take place after the rice has been harvested; but the cane\r\nis sometimes entirely cut off. The authorities of Manila, in the vain\r\nhope of stopping their devastations, employ persons to gather them and\r\nthrow them into the sea. I understood on one occasion they had spent\r\neighty thousand dollars in this way, but all to little purpose. It is\r\nsaid that the crops rarely suffer from droughts, but on the contrary\r\nthe rains are thought to fall too often, and to flood the rice fields;\r\nthese, however, yield a novel crop, and are very advantageous to the\r\npoor, viz.: a great quantity of fish, which are called dalag, and are\r\na species of Blunnius; they are so plentiful, that they are caught\r\nwith baskets: these fish weigh from a half to two pounds, and some are\r\nsaid to be eighteen inches long; but this is not all; they are said,\r\nafter a deep inundation, to be found even in the vaults of churches.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines are divided into thirty-one provinces, sixteen of\r\nwhich are on the island of Luzon, and the remainder comprise the\r\nother islands of the group and the Ladrones.\r\n\r\n[Population.] The population of the whole group is above three\r\nmillions, including all tribes of natives, mestizos, and whites. The\r\nlatter-named class are but few in number, not exceeding three\r\nthousand. The mestizos were supposed to be about fifteen or twenty\r\nthousand; they are distinguished as Spanish and Indian mestizos. The\r\nChinese have of late years increased to a large number, and it is\r\nsaid that there are forty thousand of them in and around Manila\r\nalone. One-half of the whole population belongs to Luzon. The island\r\nnext to it in the number of inhabitants is Panay, which contains\r\nabout three hundred and thirty thousand. Then come Cebu, Mindanao,\r\nLeyte, Samar, and Negros, varying from the above numbers down to\r\nfifty thousand. The population is increasing, and it is thought that\r\nit doubles itself in seventy years. This rate of increase appears\r\nprobable, from a comparison of the present population with the estimate\r\nmade at the beginning of the present century, which shows a growth\r\nin the forty years of about one million four hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nThe native population is composed of a number of distinct tribes,\r\nthe principal of which in Luzon are Pangasinan, Ilocos, Cagayan,\r\nTagalog, and Pampangan.\r\n\r\nThe Igorots, who dwell in the mountains, are the only natives who\r\nhave not been subjected by the Spaniards. The other tribes have\r\nbecome identified with their rulers in religion, and it is thought\r\nthat by this circumstance alone has Spain been able to maintain the\r\nascendency with so small a number, over such a numerous, intelligent,\r\nand energetic race as they are represented to be. This is, however,\r\nmore easily accounted for, from the Spaniards fostering and keeping\r\nalive the jealousy and hatred that existed at the time of the discovery\r\nbetween the different tribes.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost incredible that Spain should have so long persisted\r\nin the policy of allowing no more than one galleon to pass annually\r\nbetween her colonies, and equally so that the nations of Europe should\r\nhave been so long deceived in regard to the riches and wealth that\r\nSpain was monopolizing in the Philippines. The capture of Manila,\r\nin 1762, by the English, first gave a clear idea of the value of this\r\nremote and little-known appendage of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines, considered in their capacity for commerce, are\r\ncertainly among the most favored portions of the globe, and there is\r\nbut one circumstance that tends in the least degree to lessen their\r\napparent advantage; this is the prevalence of typhoons in the China\r\nseas, which are occasionally felt with force to the north of latitude\r\n10° N. South of that parallel, they have never been known to prevail,\r\nand seldom so far; but from their unfailing occurrence yearly in some\r\npart of the China seas, they are looked for with more or less dread,\r\nand cause each season a temporary interruption in all the trade that\r\npasses along the coast of these islands.\r\n\r\nThe army is now composed entirely of native troops, who number about\r\nsix thousand men, and the regiments are never suffered to serve in\r\nthe provinces in which they are recruited, but those from the north\r\nare sent to the south, and vice versa. There they are employed to keep\r\nup a continual watch on each other; and, speaking different dialects,\r\nthey never become identified.\r\n\r\nThey are, indeed, never allowed to remain long enough in one region,\r\nto imbibe any feelings in unison with those of its inhabitants. The\r\nhostility is so great among the regiments, that mutinies have occurred,\r\nand contests arisen which have produced even bloodshed, which it was\r\nentirely out of the power of the officers to prevent. In cases of\r\nthis kind, summary punishment is resorted to.\r\n\r\n[Conditions not peaceful.] Although the Spaniards, as far as is known\r\nabroad, live in peace and quiet, this is far from being the case; for\r\nrebellion and revolts among the troops and tribes are not unfrequent in\r\nthe provinces. During the time of our visit one of these took place,\r\nbut it was impossible to learn anything concerning it that could\r\nbe relied upon, for all conversation respecting such occurrences\r\nis interdicted by the government. The difficulty to which I refer\r\nwas said to have originated from the preaching of a fanatic priest,\r\nwho inflamed them to such a degree that they overthrew the troops\r\nand became temporarily masters of the country. Prompt measures were\r\nimmediately taken, and orders issued to give the rebels no quarter;\r\nthe regiments most hostile to those engaged in the revolt were ordered\r\nto the spot; they spared no one; the priest and his companions were\r\ntaken, put to death, and according to report, in a manner so cruel as\r\nto be a disgrace to the records of the nineteenth century. Although I\r\nshould hope the accounts I heard of these transactions were incorrect,\r\nyet the detestation these acts were held in, would give some color\r\nto the statements.\r\n\r\nThe few gazettes that are published at Manila are entirely under the\r\ncontrol of the government; and a resident of that city must make\r\nup his mind to remain in ignorance of the things that are passing\r\naround him, or believe just what the authorities will allow to be\r\ntold, whether truth or falsehood. The government of the Philippines\r\nis emphatically an iron rule: how long it can continue so, is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[The governor-general.] One of my first duties was to make an\r\nofficial call upon His Excellency Don Marcelino Oroa, who is the\r\nsixty-first governor of the Philippine Islands. According to the\r\nestablished etiquette, Mr. Moore, the vice-consul, announced our\r\ndesire to do so, and requested to be informed of the time when we\r\nwould be received. This was accordingly named, and at the appointed\r\nhour we proceeded to the palace in the city proper. On our arrival,\r\nwe were announced and led up a flight of steps, ample and spacious,\r\nbut by no means of such splendor as would indicate the residence of\r\nvice-royalty. The suite of rooms into which we were ushered were so\r\ndark that it was difficult to see. I made out, however, that they were\r\npanelled, and by no means richly furnished. His excellency entered\r\nfrom a side-door, and led us through two or three apartments into his\r\nprivate audience-room, an apartment not quite so dark as those we\r\nhad come from: our being conducted to this, I was told afterwards,\r\nwas to be considered an especial mark of respect to my country. His\r\nreception of us was friendly. The governor has much more the appearance\r\nof an Irishman than of a Spaniard, being tall, portly, of a florid\r\ncomplexion. He is apparently more than sixty years of age. He was\r\ndressed in a full suit of black, with a star on his breast.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore acted as interpreter, and the governor readily acceded to my\r\nrequest to be allowed to send a party into the interior for a few days;\r\na permission which I almost despaired of receiving, for I knew that\r\nhe had refused a like application some few months before. The refusal,\r\nhowever, I think was in part owing to the character of the applicants,\r\nand the doubtful object they had in view. I impute the permission we\r\nreceived to the influence of our consul, together with Mr. Sturges,\r\nwhose agreeable manners, conciliatory tone, and high standing with\r\nthe authorities, will, I am satisfied, insure us at all times every\r\nreasonable advantage or facility.\r\n\r\nThe term of the governor in office is three years, and the present\r\nincumbent was installed in 1841. This length of time is thought to be\r\nsufficient for any one of them to make a fortune. The office is held\r\nby the appointment of the ministry in Spain, and with it are connected\r\nperquisites that are shared, it is said, by those who confer them.\r\n\r\nAfter having paid our respects to his excellency, we drove to visit\r\nseveral other officers of the government, who received us without\r\nceremony. We generally found them in loose morning-gowns, smoking, and\r\ncigars were invariably offered us; for this habit appears in Manila to\r\nextend to all ranks. Even in the public offices of the custom-house\r\nit was the fashion, and cigars, with a machero for striking a light,\r\nor a joss-stick kept burning, were usually seen in every apartment.\r\n\r\n[Courteous Spanish officials.] To the captain of the port, Don Juan\r\nSalomon, I feel under many obligations for his attentions. I was\r\ndesirous of obtaining information relative to the Sulu Seas, and to\r\nlearn how far the Spanish surveys had been carried. He gave me little\r\nhopes of obtaining any; but referred me to Captain Halcon, of the\r\nSpanish Navy, who had been employed surveying some part of the coast\r\nof the islands to the north. The latter whom I visited, on my making\r\nthe inquiry of him, and stating the course I intended to pursue,\r\nfrankly told me that all the existing charts were erroneous. He\r\nonly knew enough of the ground to be certain that they were so,\r\nand consequently useless. He advised my taking one of the native\r\npilots, who were generally well acquainted with the seas that lay\r\nmore immediately in my route. The captain of the port was afterwards\r\nkind enough to offer to procure me one.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse I had with these gentlemen was a source of much\r\ngratification, and it gives me great pleasure to make this public\r\nexpression of it. To both, my sincere acknowledgments are due for\r\ninformation in relation to the various reefs and shoals that have\r\nbeen recently discovered, and which will be found placed in their\r\ntrue position on our charts.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Manila, our time was occupied in seeing sights,\r\nshopping, riding, and amusing ourselves with gazing on the throng\r\nincessantly passing through the Escolta of the Binondo suburb, or\r\nmore properly, the commercial town of Manila.\r\n\r\n[Cigar factories.] Among the lions of the place, the great royal cigar\r\nmanufactories claim especial notice from their extent and the many\r\npersons employed. There are two of these establishments, one situated\r\nin the Binondo quarter, and the other on the great square or Prado;\r\nin the former, which was visited by us, there are two buildings of\r\ntwo stories high, besides several storehouses, enclosed by a wall,\r\nwith two large gateways, at which sentinels are always posted. The\r\nprincipal workshop is in the second story, which is divided into six\r\napartments, in which eight thousand females are employed. Throughout\r\nthe whole extent, tables are arranged, about sixteen inches high,\r\nten feet long, and three feet wide, at each of which fifteen women\r\nare seated, having small piles of tobacco before them. The tables are\r\nset crosswise from the wall, leaving a space in the middle of the room\r\nfree. The labor of a female produces about two hundred cigars a day;\r\nand the working hours are from 6 a.m., till 6 p.m., with a recess of\r\ntwo hours, from eleven till one o'clock. The whole establishment is\r\nkept very neat and clean, and every thing appears to be carried on\r\nin the most systematic and workmanlike manner. Among such numbers,\r\nit has been found necessary to institute a search on their leaving\r\nthe establishment to prevent embezzlement, and this is regularly\r\nmade twice a day, without distinction of sex. It is a strange sight\r\nto witness the ingress and egress of these hordes of females; and\r\nprobably the world cannot elsewhere exhibit so large a number of ugly\r\nwomen. Their ages vary from fifteen to forty-five. The sum paid them\r\nfor wages is very trifling. The whole number of persons employed in the\r\nmanufactories is about fifteen thousand; this includes the officers,\r\nclerks, overseers, etc.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as I could ascertain, the revenue derived from these\r\nestablishments is half a million of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the Philippines are industrious. They manufacture an\r\namount of goods sufficient to supply their own wants, particularly\r\nfrom Panay and Ilocos. These for the most part consist of cotton and\r\nsilks, and a peculiar article called piña. The latter is manufactured\r\nfrom a species of Bromelia (pineapple), and comes principally\r\nfrom the island of Panay. The finest kinds of piña are exceedingly\r\nbeautiful, and surpass any other material in its evenness and beauty\r\nof texture. Its color is yellowish, and the embroidery is fully\r\nequal to the material. It is much sought after by all strangers,\r\nand considered as one of the curiosities of this group. Various\r\nreports have been stated of the mode of its manufacture, and among\r\nothers that it was woven under water, which I found, upon inquiry,\r\nto be quite erroneous. The web of the piña is so fine, that they\r\nare obliged to prevent all currents of air from passing through the\r\nrooms where it is manufactured, for which purpose there are gauze\r\nscreens in the windows. After the article is brought to Manila, it\r\nis then embroidered by girls; this last operation adds greatly to\r\nits value. We visited one of the houses where this was in progress,\r\nand where the most skilful workwomen are employed.\r\n\r\nOn mounting the stairs of bamboos, every step we took produced its\r\ncreak; but, although the whole seemed but a crazy affair, yet it did\r\nnot want for strength, being well and firmly bound together. There\r\nwere two apartments, each about thirteen by twenty-five feet, which\r\ncould be divided by screens, if required. At the end of it were seen\r\nabout forty females, all busily plying their needles, and so closely\r\nseated as apparently to incommode each other. The mistress of the\r\nmanufactory, who was quite young, gave us a friendly reception, and\r\nshowed us the whole process of drawing the threads and working the\r\npatterns, which, in many cases, were elegant.\r\n\r\nA great variety of dresses, scarfs, caps, collars, cuffs, and\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, were shown us. These were mostly in the rough\r\nstate, and did not strike us with that degree of admiration which was\r\nexpected. They, however, had been in hand for six months, and were\r\nsoiled by much handling; but when others were shown us in the finished\r\nstate, washed and put up, they were such as to claim our admiration.\r\n\r\nI was soon attracted by a very different sight at the other end of the\r\napartment. This was a dancing-master and his scholar, of six years old,\r\nthe daughter of the woman of the house. It was exceedingly amusing\r\nto see the airs and graces of this child.\r\n\r\nFor music they had a guitar; and I never witnessed a ballet that\r\ngave me more amusement, or saw a dancer that evinced more grace,\r\nease, confidence, and decided talent, than did this little girl. She\r\nwas prettily formed, and was exceedingly admired and applauded by us\r\nall. Her mother considered her education as finished, and looked on\r\nwith all the admiration and fondness of parental affection.\r\n\r\nOn inquiry, I found that the idea of teaching her to read and write had\r\nnot yet been entertained. Yet every expense is incurred to teach them\r\nto use their feet and arms, and to assume the expression of countenance\r\nthat will enable them to play a part in the afterscenes of life.\r\n\r\nThis manufactory had work engaged for nine months or a year in\r\nadvance. The fabric is extremely expensive, and none but the wealthy\r\ncan afford it. It is also much sought after by foreigners. Even orders\r\nfor Queen Victoria and many of the English nobility were then in hand;\r\nat least I so heard at Manila. Those who are actually present have,\r\nnotwithstanding, the privilege of selecting what they wish to purchase;\r\nfor, with the inhabitants here, as elsewhere, ready money has too\r\nmuch attraction for them to forego the temptation.\r\n\r\nTime in Manila seems to hang heavily on the hands of some of its\r\ninhabitants; their amusements are few, and the climate ill adapted to\r\nexertion. The gentlemen of the higher classes pass their morning in\r\nthe transaction of a little public business, lounging about, smoking,\r\netc. In the afternoon, they sleep, and ride on the Prado; and in the\r\nevening, visit their friends, or attend a tertulia. The ladies are to\r\nbe pitied; for they pass three-fourths of their time in déshabillé,\r\nwith their maids around them, sleeping, dressing, lolling, and combing\r\ntheir hair. In this way the whole morning is lounged away; they neither\r\nread, write, nor work. In dress they generally imitate the Europeans,\r\nexcept that they seldom wear stockings, and go with their arms bare. In\r\nthe afternoon they ride on the Prado in state, and in the evening\r\naccompany their husbands. Chocolate is taken early in the morning,\r\nbreakfast at eleven, and dinner and supper are included in one meal.\r\n\r\nMothers provide for the marriage of their daughters; and I was told\r\nthat such a thing as a gentleman proposing to any one but the mother,\r\nor a young lady engaging herself, is unknown and unheard of. The\r\nnegotiation is all carried forward by the mother, and the daughter is\r\ngiven to any suitor she may deem a desirable match. The young ladies\r\nare said to be equally disinclined to a choice themselves, and if\r\nproposals were made to them, the suitor would be at once referred to\r\nthe mother. Among the lower orders it is no uncommon thing for the\r\nparties to be living without the ceremony of marriage, until they have\r\na family and no odium whatever is attached to such a connexion. They\r\nare looked upon as man and wife, though they do not live together; and\r\nthey rarely fail to solemnize their union when they have accumulated\r\nsufficient property to procure the requisite articles for housekeeping.\r\n\r\n[The Luneta.] Three nights in each week they have music in the plaza,\r\nin front of the governor's palace, by the bands of four different\r\nregiments, who collect there after the evening parade. Most of the\r\nbetter class resort here, for the pleasure of enjoying it. We went\r\nthither to see the people as well as to hear the music. This is the\r\ngreat resort of the haut ton, who usually have their carriages in\r\nwaiting, and promenade in groups backwards and forwards during the\r\ntime the music is playing. This is by far the best opportunity that\r\none can have for viewing the society of Manila, which seems as easy\r\nand unrestrained as the peculiar gravity and ceremonious mode of\r\nintercourse among the old Spaniards can admit. Before the present\r\ngovernor took office, it had been the custom to allow the bands to\r\nplay on the Prado every fine evening, when all the inhabitants could\r\nenjoy it until a late hour; but he has interdicted this practice,\r\nand of course given much dissatisfaction; he is said to have done\r\nthis in a fit of ill temper, and although importuned to restore this\r\namusement to the common people, he pertinaciously refuses.\r\n\r\nThe bands of the regiments are under the direction of Frenchmen and\r\nSpaniards: the musicians are all natives, and play with a correct ear.\r\n\r\nOur afternoons were spent in drives on the Prado, where all the\r\nfashion and rank of Manila are to be met, and where it is exceedingly\r\nagreeable to partake of the fresh and pure air after a heated day in\r\nthe city. The extreme end of the Prado lies along the shore of the bay\r\nof Manila, having the roadstead and ships on one side, and the city\r\nproper with its fortifications and moats on the other. This drive\r\nusually lasts for an hour, and all sorts of vehicles are shown off,\r\nfrom the governor's coach and six, surrounded by his lancers, to the\r\nsorry chaise and limping nag. The carriage most used is a four-wheeled\r\nbiloche, with a gig top, quite low, and drawn by two horses, on one\r\nof which is a postilion; these vehicles are exceedingly comfortable\r\nfor two persons. The horses are small, but spirited, and are said\r\nto be able to undergo great fatigue, although their appearance\r\ndoes not promise it. This drive is enlivened by the music of the\r\ndifferent regiments, who are at this time to be seen manoeuvering on\r\nthe Prado. The soldiers have a very neat and clean appearance; great\r\nattention is paid to them, and the whole are well appointed. The force\r\nstationed in Manila is six thousand, and the army in the Philippines\r\namounts to twenty thousand men. The officers are all Spaniards,\r\ngenerally the relations and friends of those in the administration\r\nof the government. The pay of the soldiers is four dollars a month,\r\nand a ration, which is equal to six cents a day. As troops I was told,\r\nthey acquitted themselves well. The Prado is laid out in many avenues,\r\nleading in various directions to the suburbs, and these are planted\r\nwith wild almond trees, which afford a pleasant shade. It is well kept,\r\nand creditable to the city.\r\n\r\nIn passing the crowds of carriages very little display of female\r\nbeauty is observed, and although well-dressed above, one cannot but\r\nrevert to their wearing no stockings beneath.\r\n\r\nOn the Prado is a small theatre, but so inferior that the building\r\nscarce deserves the name: the acting was equally bad. This amusement\r\nmeets with little encouragement in Manila and, I was told, was\r\ndiscountenanced by the Governor.\r\n\r\n[A tertulia.] I had the pleasure during our stay of attending a\r\ntertulia in the city. The company was not a large one, comprising\r\nsome thirty or forty ladies and about sixty gentlemen. It resembled\r\nthose of the mother country. Dancing was introduced at an early hour,\r\nand continued till a few minutes before eleven o'clock, at which\r\ntime the gates of the city are always shut. It was amusing to see\r\nthe sudden breaking up of the party, most of the guests residing out\r\nof the city. The calling for carriages, shawls, hats, etc., produced\r\nfor a few minutes great confusion, every one being desirous of getting\r\noff at the earliest moment possible, for fear of being too late. This\r\nregulation, by which the gates are closed at so early an hour, does\r\nnot appear necessary, and only serves to interrupt the communication\r\nbetween the foreign and Spanish society as the former is obliged, as\r\nbefore observed, to live outside of the city proper. This want of free\r\nintercourse is to be regretted, as it prevents that kind of friendship\r\nby which many of their jealousies and prejudices might be removed.\r\n\r\nThe society at this tertulia was easy, and so far as the enjoyment\r\nof dancing went, pleasant; but there was no conversation. The\r\nrefreshments consisted of a few dulces, lemonade, and strong drinks\r\nin an anteroom. The house appeared very spacious and well adapted for\r\nentertainments, but only one of the rooms was well lighted. From the\r\nnovelty of the scene, and the attentions of the gentleman of the house,\r\nwe passed a pleasant evening.\r\n\r\nThe natives and mestizos attracted much of my attention at\r\nManila. Their dress is peculiar: over a pair of striped trousers\r\nof various colors, the men usually wear a fine grass-cloth shirt,\r\na large straw hat, and around the head or neck a many colored silk\r\nhandkerchief. They often wear slippers as well as shoes. The Chinese\r\ndress, as they have done for centuries, in loose white shirts and\r\ntrousers. One peculiarity of the common men is their passion for\r\ncock-fighting; and they carry these fowls wherever they go, after a\r\npeculiar fashion under their arm.\r\n\r\n[Cock-figghting.] Cock-fighting is licensed by the government, and\r\ngreat care is taken in the breeding of game fowls, which are very large\r\nand heavy birds. They are armed with a curved double-edged gaff. The\r\nexhibitions are usually crowded with half-breeds or mestizos, who are\r\ngenerally more addicted to gambling than either the higher or lower\r\nclasses of Spaniards. It would not be an unapt designation to call\r\nthe middling class cock-fighters, for their whole lives seem to be\r\ntaken up with the breeding and fighting of these birds. On the exit\r\nfrom a cockpit, I was much amused with the mode of giving the return\r\ncheck, which was done by a stamp on the naked arm, and precludes\r\nthe possibility of its transfer to another person. The dress of the\r\nlower order of females is somewhat civilized, yet it bore so strong\r\na resemblance to that of the Polynesians as to recall the latter\r\nto our recollection. A long piece of colored cotton is wound round\r\nthe body, like the pareu, and tucked in at the side: this covers\r\nthe nether limbs; and a jacket fitting close to the body is worn,\r\nwithout a shirt. In some, this jacket is ornamented with work around\r\nthe neck; it has no collar, and in many cases no sleeves, and over\r\nthis a richly embroidered cape. The feet are covered with slippers,\r\nwith wooden soles, which are kept on by the little toe, only four toes\r\nentering the slipper, and the little one being on the outside. The\r\neffect of both costumes is picturesque.\r\n\r\n[Ducks.] The market is a never failing place of amusement to a\r\nforeigner, for there a crowd of the common people is always to be seen,\r\nand their mode of conducting business may be observed. The canals\r\nhere afford great facilities for bringing vegetables and produce to\r\nmarket in a fresh state. The vegetables are chiefly brought from the\r\nshores of the Laguna de Bay, through the river Pasig. The meat appeared\r\ninferior, and as in all Spanish places the art of butchering is not\r\nunderstood. The poultry, however, surpasses that of any other place\r\nI have seen, particularly in ducks, the breeding of which is pursued\r\nto a great extent. Establishments for breeding these birds are here\r\ncarried on in a systematic manner, and are a great curiosity. They\r\nconsist of many small enclosures, each about twenty feet by forty or\r\nfifty, made of bamboo, which are placed on the bank of the river,\r\nand partly covered with water. In one corner of the enclosure is a\r\nsmall house, where the eggs are hatched by artificial heat, produced\r\nby rice-chaff in a state of of fermentation. It is not uncommon to see\r\nsix or eight hundred ducklings all of the same age. There are several\r\nhundreds of these enclosures, and the number of ducks of all ages\r\nmay be computed at millions. The manner in which they are schooled\r\nto take exercise, and to go in and out of the water, and to return\r\nto their house, almost exceeds belief. The keepers or tenders are of\r\nthe Tagalog tribe, who live near the enclosures, and have them at all\r\ntimes under their eye. The old birds are not suffered to approach\r\nthe young, and all of one age are kept together. They are fed upon\r\nrice and a small species of shell-fish that is found in the river\r\nand is peculiar to it. From the extent of these establishments we\r\ninferred that ducks were the favorite article of food at Manila, and\r\nthe consumption of them must be immense. The markets are well supplied\r\nwith chickens, pigeons, young partridges, which are brought in alive,\r\nand turkeys. Among strange articles that we saw for sale, were cakes\r\nof coagulated blood. The markets are well stocked with a variety of\r\nfish, taken both in the Laguna and bay of Manila, affording a supply\r\nof both the fresh and salt water species, and many smaller kinds that\r\nare dried and smoked. Vegetables are in great plenty, and consist\r\nof pumpkins, lettuce, onions, radishes, very long squashes, etc.;\r\nof fruits, they have melons, chicos, durians, marbolas, and oranges.\r\n\r\n[Fish.] Fish are caught in weirs, by the hook, or in seines. The former\r\nare constructed of bamboo stakes, in the shallow water of the lake,\r\nat the point where it flows through the Pasig river. In the bay,\r\nand at the mouth of the river, the fish are taken in nets, suspended\r\nby the four corners from hoops attached to a crane, by which they are\r\nlowered into the water. The fishing-boats are little better than rafts,\r\nand are called sarabaos.\r\n\r\nThe usual passage-boat is termed banca, and is made of a single\r\ntrunk. These are very much used by the inhabitants. They have a\r\nsort of awning to protect the passenger from the rays of the sun;\r\nand being light are easily rowed about, although they are exceedingly\r\nuncomfortable to sit in, from the lowness of the seats, and liable to\r\noverset, if the weight is not placed near the bottom. The outrigger\r\nwas very often dispensed with, owing to the impediment it offered to\r\nthe navigation of their canals; these canals offer great facilities\r\nfor the transportation of burdens; the banks of almost all of them\r\nare faced with granite. Where the streets cross them, there are\r\nsubstantial stone bridges, which are generally of no more than one\r\narch, so as not to impede the navigation. The barges used for the\r\ntransportation of produce resemble our canal-boats, and have sliding\r\nroofs to protect them from the rain.\r\n\r\nWater, for the supply of vessels, is brought off in large earthen\r\njars. It is obtained from the river, and if care is not taken, the\r\nwater will be impure; it ought to be filled beyond the city. Our\r\nsupply was obtained five or six miles up the river, by a lighter,\r\nin which were placed a number of water-casks. It proved excellent.\r\n\r\nThe trade of Manila extends to all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThere are many facilities for the transaction of business, as far as\r\nthe shipment of articles is concerned; but great difficulties attend\r\nthe settling of disputed accounts, collecting debts, etc., in the\r\nway of which the laws passed in 1834 have thrown many obstacles. All\r\ncommercial business of this kind goes before, first, the Junta\r\nde Comercio, and then an appeal to the Tribunal de Comercio. This\r\nappeal, however, is merely nominal; for the same judges preside in\r\neach, and they are said to be susceptible of influences that render\r\nan appeal to them by honest men at all times hazardous. The opinion\r\nof those who have had the misfortune to be obliged to recur to these\r\ntribunals is, that it is better to suffer wrong than encounter both\r\nthe expense and vexation of a resort to them for justice. In the\r\nfirst of these courts the decision is long delayed, fees exacted,\r\nand other expenses incurred; and when judgment is at length given,\r\nit excites one party or the other to appeal: other expenses accrue\r\nin consequence, and the advocates and judges grow rich while both the\r\nlitigants suffer. I understood that these tribunals were intended to\r\nsimplify business, lessen the time of suits, and promote justice; but\r\nthese results have not been obtained, and many believe that they have\r\nhad the contrary effect, and have opened the road to further abuses.\r\n\r\n[Environs.] The country around Manila, though no more than an extended\r\nplain for some miles, is one of great interest and beauty, and affords\r\nmany agreeable rides on the roads to Santa Ana and Mariquina. Most of\r\nthe country-seats are situated on the Pasig river; they may indeed\r\nbe called palaces, from their extent and appearance. They are built\r\nupon a grand scale, and after the Italian style, with terraces,\r\nsupported by strong abutments, decked with vases of plants. The\r\ngrounds are ornamented with the luxuriant, lofty, and graceful trees\r\nof the tropics; these are tolerably well kept. Here and there fine\r\nlarge stone churches, with their towers and steeples, are to be seen,\r\nthe whole giving the impression of a wealthy nobility, and a happy\r\nand flourishing peasantry.\r\n\r\n[The cemetery.] In one of our rides we made a visit to the Campo Santo\r\nor cemetery, about four miles from Manila. It is small, but has many\r\nhandsome trees about it; among them was an Agati, full of large white\r\nflowers, showing most conspicuously. The whole place is as unlike a\r\ndepository of the dead as it well can be. Its form is circular, having\r\na small chapel, in the form of a rotunda, directly opposite the gate,\r\nor entrance. The walls are about twenty feet high, with three tiers of\r\nniches, in which the bodies are enclosed with quicklime. Here they are\r\nallowed to remain for three years, or until such time as the niches\r\nmay be required for further use. Niches may be purchased, however,\r\nand permanently closed up; but in the whole cemetery there were but\r\nfive thus secured. This would seem to indicate an indifference on the\r\npart of the living, for their departed relatives or friends; at least\r\nsuch was my impression at the time. The center of the enclosure is laid\r\nout as a flower-garden and shrubbery, and all the buildings are washed\r\na deep buff-color, with white cornices; these colors, when contrasted\r\nwith the green foliage, give an effect that is not unpleasing. In\r\nthe chapel are two tombs, the one for the bishop, and the other for\r\nthe governor. The former, I believe, is occupied, and will continue\r\nto be so, until another shall follow him; but the latter is empty,\r\nfor, since the erection of the cemetery, none of the governors have\r\ndied. In the rear of the chapel is another small cemetery, called Los\r\nAngeles; and, further behind, the Osero. The former is similar to the\r\none in front, but smaller, and appropriated exclusively to children;\r\nthe latter is an open space, where the bones of all those who have\r\nbeen removed from the niches, after three years, are east out, and\r\nnow lie in a confused heap, with portions of flesh and hair adhering\r\nto them. No person is allowed to be received here for interment,\r\nuntil the fees are first paid to the priest, however respectable the\r\nparties may be; and all those who pay the fees, and are of the true\r\nfaith, can be interred. I was told of a corpse of a very respectable\r\nperson being refused admittance, for the want of the priest's pass,\r\nto show that the claim had been satisfied, and the coffin stopped\r\nin the road until it was obtained. We ourselves witnessed a similar\r\nrefusal. A servant entered with a dead child; borne on a tray, which\r\nhe presented to the sacristan to have interred, the latter asked him\r\nfor the pass, which not being produced, he was dismissed, nor was he\r\nsuffered to leave his burden until this requisite could be procured\r\nfrom the priest, who lived opposite. The price of interment was three\r\ndollars, but whether this included the purchase of the niche, or its\r\nrent for the three years only, I did not learn.\r\n\r\nThe churches of Manila can boast of several fine-toned bells, which\r\nare placed in large belfries or towers. There was one of these towers\r\nnear the Messrs. Sturges', where we stayed; and the manner in which\r\nthe bell was used, when swung around by the force of two or three men,\r\nattracted our attention; for the ringers occasionally practised feats\r\nof agility by passing over with the bell, and landing on the coping on\r\nthe opposite side. The tower being open, we could see the manoeuver\r\nfrom the windows, and, as strangers, went there to look on. One day,\r\nwhilst at dinner, they began to ring, and as many of the officers\r\nhad not witnessed the fact, they sought the windows. This excited\r\nthe vanity of those in the belfry, who redoubled their exertions,\r\nand performed the feat successfully many times, although in some\r\ninstances they narrowly escaped accident, by landing just within\r\nthe outside coping. This brought us all to the window, and the next\r\nturn, more force having been given to the bell, the individual who\r\nattempted the feat was thrown headlong beyond the tower, and dashed\r\nto pieces on the pavement beneath. Although shocked at the accident,\r\nI felt still more so when, after a few minutes, the bell was again\r\nheard making its usual sound, as if nothing had occurred to interrupt\r\nthe course of its hourly peals.\r\n\r\n[Monasteries.] In company with Dr. Tolben, I visited one of the\r\nconvents where he attended on some of the monks who were sick; he\r\nseemed well acquainted with them all. I was much struck with the extent\r\nof the building, which was four stories high, with spacious corridors\r\nand galleries, the walls of which were furnished with pictures\r\nrepresenting the martyrdom of the Dominican friars in Japan. These were\r\nabout seventy in number, in the Chinese style of art, and evidently\r\npainted by some one of that nation, calling himself an artist. From\r\nappearances, however, I should think they were composed by the priests,\r\nwho have not a little taxed their invention to find out the different\r\nmodes in which a man can be put to death. Many evidently, if not all,\r\nhad been invented for the pictures. So perplexed had they apparently\r\nbeen, that in one of the last it was observed that the executioner\r\nheld his victim at arms' length by the heels, and was about to let him\r\ndrop headforemost into a well. From the galleries we passed into the\r\nlibrary, and thence into many of the rooms, and finally we mounted to\r\nthe top of the monastery, which affords a beautiful view of the bay,\r\ncity, and suburbs. There I was presented to three of the friars,\r\nwho were pleasant and jolly-looking men. Upon the roof was a kind\r\nof observatory, or look-out, simply furnished with billiard-tables\r\nand shuffleboards, while the implements for various other games lay\r\nabout on small tables, with telescopes on stands, and comfortable\r\narm-chairs. It was a place where the friars put aside their religious\r\nand austere character or appearance, and sought amusement. It was\r\na delightful spot, so far as coolness and the freshness of the sea\r\nair were concerned, and its aspect gave me an insight behind the\r\ncurtain of these establishments that very soon disclosed many things\r\nI was ignorant of before. All the friars were of a rotund form,\r\nand many of them bore the marks of good living in their full, red,\r\nand bloated faces. It seems to be generally understood at Manila,\r\nthat they live upon the fat of the land. We visited several of the\r\nrooms, and were warmly greeted by the padres, one of whom presented\r\nme with a meteorological table for the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of all these religious establishments are considerable;\r\nthe one I visited belonged to the Dominicans, and was very rich. Their\r\nrevenues are principally derived from lands owned by them, and the\r\ntithes from the different districts which they have under their charge,\r\nto which are added many alms and gifts. On inquiry, I found their\r\ngeneral character was by no means thought well of, and they had of\r\nlate years lost much of the influence that they possessed before the\r\nrevolution in the mother country.\r\n\r\nAmong the inhabitants we saw here, was a native boy of the Igorots,\r\nor mountain tribe. He is said to be a true Negrito. (Another confusion\r\nof facts.--C.)\r\n\r\n[Mountaineers.] The Spaniards, as has been stated, have never been\r\nable to subdue this tribe, who are said to be still as wild as on\r\ntheir first landing; they are confined almost altogether to the plains\r\nwithin or near the mountains, and from time to time make inroads in\r\ngreat force on the outer settlements, carrying off as much plunder\r\nas possible. The burden of this often causes them to be overtaken\r\nby the troops. When overtaken, they fight desperately, and were it\r\nnot for the fire-arms of their adversaries, would give them much\r\ntrouble. Few are captured on such occasions, and it is exceedingly\r\ndifficult to take them alive, unless when very young. These mountains\r\nfurnish them with an iron ore almost pure, in manufacturing which\r\nthey show much ingenuity. Some of their weapons were presented to\r\nthe Expedition by Josiah Moore, Esq. These are probably imitations\r\nof the early Spanish weapons used against them. From all accounts,\r\nthe natives are of Malay origin, and allied to those of the other\r\nislands of the extensive archipelago of the Eastern Seas; but the\r\npopulation of the towns and cities of the island are so mixed,\r\nfrom the constant intercourse with Chinese, Europeans, and others,\r\nthat there is no pure blood among them. When at Manila, we obtained a\r\ngrammar of the Tagalog language, which is said to be now rarely heard,\r\nand to have become nearly obsolete. This grammar is believed to be the\r\nonly one extant, and was procured from a padre, who presented it to the\r\nExpedition. (Tagalog is here mistaken for a mountaineer's dialect.--C.)\r\n\r\nThe Pampangans are considered the finest tribe of natives; they are\r\nexcessively fond of horse-racing, and bet very considerable sums upon\r\nit; they have the reputation of being an industrious and energetic\r\nset of men.\r\n\r\n[Revenue.] The mode of raising revenue by a poll-tax causes great\r\ndiscontent among all classes, for although light, it is, as it always\r\nhas been elsewhere, unpopular. All the Chinese pay a capitation tax\r\nof four dollars. The revenue from various sources is said to amount\r\nto one million six hundred thousand dollars, of which the poll-tax\r\namounts to more than one-half, the rest being derived from the customs,\r\ntobacco, etc. There is no tax upon land. It was thought at Manila\r\nthat a revenue might be derived by indirect taxation, far exceeding\r\nthis sum, without being sensibly felt by the inhabitants. This mode\r\nis employed in the eastern islands under the English and Dutch rule,\r\nand it is surprising that the Spaniards also do not adopt it, or some\r\nother method to increase resources that are so much needed. Whenever\r\nthe ministry in Spain had to meet a claim, they were a few years\r\nago in the habit of issuing drafts on this colonial government in\r\npayment. These came at last in such numbers, that latterly they have\r\nbeen compelled to suspend the payment of them.\r\n\r\nThe revenue of the colonial government is very little more than will\r\nmeet the expenses; and it is believed that, notwithstanding these\r\nunaccepted claims, it received orders to remit the surplus, if any,\r\nto Spain, regardless of honor or good faith.\r\n\r\n[Government.] The government of the Philippines is in the hands of a\r\ngovernor-general, who has the titles of viceroy, commander-in-chief,\r\nsub-delegate, judge of the revenue from the post-office, commander of\r\nthe troops, captain-general, and commander of the naval forces. His\r\nduties embrace every thing that relates to the security and defence\r\nof the country. As advisers, he has a council called the Audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe islands are divided into provinces, each of which has a\r\nmilitary officer with the title of governor, appointed by the\r\ngovernor-general. They act as chief magistrates, have jurisdiction\r\nover all disputes of minor importance, have the command of the troops\r\nin time of war, and are collectors of the royal revenues, for the\r\nsecurity of which they give bonds, which must be approved of by the\r\ncomptroller-general of the treasury. The province of Cavite is alone\r\nexempt from this rule, and the collection of tribute is there confided\r\nto a police magistrate.\r\n\r\nEach province is again sub-divided into pueblos, containing a greater\r\nor less number of inhabitants, each of which has again its ruler,\r\ncalled a gobernadorcillo, who has in like manner other officers under\r\nhim to act as police magistrates. The number of the latter are very\r\ngreat, each of them having his appropriate duties. These consist in the\r\nsupervision of the grain fields, coconut groves, betel-nut plantations,\r\nand in the preservation of the general order and peace of the town. So\r\nnumerous are these petty officers, that there is scarcely a family of\r\nany consequence, that has not a member who holds some kind of office\r\nunder government. This policy, in case of disturbances, at once\r\nunites a large and influential body on the side of the government,\r\nthat is maintained at little expense. The gobernadorcillo exercises\r\nthe municipal authority, and is especially charged to aid the parish\r\npriest in every thing appertaining to religious observances, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the towns where the descendants of the Chinese are sufficiently\r\nnumerous, they can, by permission of the governor, elect their own\r\npetty governors and officers from among themselves.\r\n\r\nIn each town there is also a headman (cabeza de barangay), who has\r\nthe charge of fifty tributaries, in each of which is included as\r\nmany families. This division is called a barangay. This office forms\r\nby far the most important part of the machinery of government in the\r\nPhilippine Islands, for these headmen are the attorneys of these small\r\ndistricts, and become the electors of the gobernadorcillos, and other\r\ncivil officers. Only twelve, however, of them or their substitutes,\r\nare allowed to vote in each town.\r\n\r\nThe office of head-man existed before the conquest of the island,\r\nand the Spaniards showed their wisdom in continuing and adapting it to\r\ntheir system of police. The office among the natives was hereditary,\r\nbut their conquerors made it also elective, and when a vacancy now\r\noccurs through want of heirs, or resignation, it is filled up by\r\nthe superintendent of the province, on the recommendation of the\r\ngobernadorcillo and the headman. This is also the case when any new\r\noffice is created. The privileges of the headmen are great; themselves,\r\ntheir wives, and their first-born children, are exempted from paying\r\ntribute to the crown, an exoneration which is owing to their being\r\ncollectors of the royal revenues. Their duties consist in maintaining\r\ngood order and harmony, in dividing the labor required for the public\r\nbenefit equally, adjusting differences, and receiving the taxes.\r\n\r\nThe gobernadorcillo takes cognizance of all civil cases not exceeding\r\ntwo taels of gold, or forty-four dollars in silver; all criminal\r\ncases must be sent to the chief of the province. The headmen formerly\r\nserved for no more than three years, and if this was done faithfully,\r\nthey became and were designated as principals, in virtue of which\r\nrank they received the title of Don.\r\n\r\nThe election takes place at the court-house of the town; the electors\r\nare the gobernadorcillo whose office is about to expire, and twelve\r\nof the oldest headmen, cabezas de barangay, collectors of tribute\r\nfor the gobernadorcillo they must select, by a plurality of votes,\r\nthree individuals, who must be able to speak, read, and write the\r\nSpanish language. The voting is done by ballot, in the presence\r\nof the notary (escribano), and the chief of the province, who\r\npresides. The curate may be present, to look after the interest of\r\nthe church but for no other purpose. After the votes are taken, they\r\nare sealed and transmitted to the governor-general, who selects one\r\nof the three candidates, and issues a commission. In the more distant\r\nprovinces, the chief of the district has the authority to select the\r\ngobernadorcillo, and fill up the commission, a blank form of which,\r\nsigned by the governor-general, is left with him for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe headmen may be elected petty governors, and still retain their\r\noffice, and collect the tribute or taxes; for it is not considered\r\njust, that the important office of chief of Barangay should deprive\r\nthe holder of the honor of being elected gobernadorcillo.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the Chinese reside in the province of Tondo,\r\nbut the tribute is there collected by the alcalde mayor, with an\r\nassistant taken from among the officers of the royal treasury.\r\n\r\nThe poll-tax on the Chinese amounts to four dollars a head; it was\r\nformerly one-half more. Tax-lists of the Chinese are kept, in which\r\nthey are registered and classified; and opposite the name is the\r\namount at which the individual is assessed.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish government seems particularly desirous of giving\r\nconsequence even to its lowest offices; and in order to secure it to\r\nthem, it is directed that the chiefs of provinces, shall treat the\r\ngobernadorcillos with respect, offering them seats when they enter\r\ntheir houses or other places, and not allowing them to remain standing;\r\nfurthermore, the parish curates are required to treat them with\r\nequal respect. So far as concerns the provinces, the government may\r\nbe called, notwithstanding the officers, courts. etc., monastic. The\r\npriests rule, and frequently administer punishment, with their own\r\nhands, to either sex, of which an instance will be cited hereafter.\r\n\r\n[A country excursion.] As soon as we could procure the necessary\r\npassports, which were obligingly furnished by the governor to \"Don\r\nRussel Sturges y quatro Anglo Americanos,\" our party left Manila\r\nfor a short jaunt to the mountains. It was considered as a mark of\r\ngreat favor on the part of his excellency to grant this indulgence,\r\nparticularly as he had a few months prior denied it to a party of\r\nFrench officers. I was told that he preferred to make it a domestic\r\nconcern, by issuing the passport in the name of a resident, in order\r\nthat compliance in this case might not give umbrage to the French. It\r\nwas generally believed that the cause of the refusal in the former\r\ninstance was the imprudent manner in which the French officers went\r\nabout taking plans and sketches, at the corners of streets, etc., which\r\nin the minds of an unenlightened and ignorant colonial government, of\r\ncourse excited suspicion. Nothing can be so ridiculous as this system\r\nof passports; for if one was so disposed, a plan, and the most minute\r\ninformation of every thing that concerns the defences of places, can\r\nalways be obtained at little cost now-a-days; for such is the skill of\r\nengineers, that a plan is easily made of places, merely by a sight of\r\nthem. We were not, however, disposed to question the propriety of the\r\ngovernor's conduct in the former case, and I left abundantly obliged\r\nto him for a permission that would add to our stock of information.\r\n\r\nIt was deemed at first impossible for the party to divide, as they\r\nhad but one passport, and some difficulties were anticipated from\r\nthe number being double that stated in the passport. The party\r\nconsisted of Messrs. Sturges, Pickering, Eld, Rich, Dana, and\r\nBrackenridge. Mr. Sturges, however, saw no difficulty in dividing the\r\nparty after they had passed beyond the precincts of the city, taking\r\nthe precaution, at the same time, not to appear together beyond the\r\nnumber designated on the paper.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, they left Manila, and proceeded in carriages to Santa Ana,\r\non the Pasig, in order to avoid the delay that would ensue if they\r\nfollowed the windings of the river in a banca, and against the current.\r\n\r\nAt Santa Ana they found their bancas waiting for them, and\r\nembarked. Here the scene was rendered animated by numerous boats of\r\nall descriptions, from the parao to the small canoe of a single log.\r\n\r\nThere is a large population that live wholly on the water: for the\r\npadrones of the parao have usually their families with them, which,\r\nfrom the great variety of ages and sexes, give a very different and\r\nmuch more bustling appearance to the crowd of boats, than would be the\r\ncase if they only contained those who are employed to navigate them. At\r\ntimes the paraos and bancas, of all sizes, together with the saraboas\r\nand pativas (duck establishments), become jumbled together, and create\r\na confusion and noise such as is seldom met with in any other country.\r\n\r\n[Duck farms.] The pativas are under the care of the original\r\ninhabitants, to whom exclusively the superintendence of the ducklings\r\nseems to be committed. The pens are made of bamboo, and are not\r\nover a foot high. The birds were all in admirable order, and made no\r\nattempt to escape over the low barrier, although so light that it was\r\nthought by some of our gentlemen it would not have sufficed to confine\r\nAmerican ducks, although their wings might have been cut. The mode of\r\ngiving them exercise was by causing them to run round in a ring. The\r\ngood understanding existing between the keepers and their charge was\r\nstriking, particularly when the former were engaged in cleansing the\r\npens, and assisting the current to carry off the impurities. In the\r\ncourse of their sail, it was estimated that hundreds of thousands of\r\nducks of all ages were seen.\r\n\r\nThe women who were seen were usually engaged in fishing with a hook\r\nand line, and were generally standing in the water, or in canoes. The\r\nsaraboas were here also in use. The run of the fish is generally\r\nconcentrated by a chevaux-de-frise to guide them towards the nets\r\nand localities where the fishermen place themselves.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock they reached the Laguna de Bay, where they took in a\r\nnew crew, with mast and sail. This is called twenty-five miles from\r\nManila by the river; the distance in a bird's flight is not over\r\ntwelve. The whole distance is densely peopled, and well cultivated. The\r\ncrops consist of indigo, rice, etc., with groves of the betel, palm,\r\ncoconut, and quantities of fruit trees.\r\n\r\nThe shores of the lake are shelving, and afford good situations\r\nfor placing fish-weirs, which are here established on an extensive\r\nscale. These weirs are formed of slips of bamboo, and are to be seen\r\nrunning in every direction to the distance of two or three miles. They\r\nmay be said to invest entirely the shores of the lake for several miles\r\nfrom its outlet, and without a pilot it would be difficult to find the\r\nway through them. At night, when heron and tern were seen roosting on\r\nthe top of each slat, these weirs presented rather a curious spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe Laguna de Bay is said to be about ten leagues in length by three in\r\nwidth, and trends in a north-northwest and south-southeast direction.\r\n\r\nAfter dark, the bancas separated. Mr. Sturges, with Dr. Pickering\r\nand Mr. Eld, proceeded to visit the mountain of Maijaijai,\r\nwhile Messrs. Rich, Dana, and Brackenridge, went towards the Taal\r\nVolcano. The latter party took the passport, while the former relied\r\nupon certain letters of introduction for protection, in case of\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nMr. Sturges, with his party, directed his course to the east side\r\nof the lake, towards a point called Jalajala, which they reached\r\nabout three o'clock in the morning, and stopped for the crew to cook\r\nsome rice, etc. At 8 o'clock a.m., they reached Santa Cruz, situated\r\nabout half a mile up a small streamlet, called Paxanau. At this place\r\nthey found Don Escudero to whom they had a letter of introduction,\r\nand who holds a civil appointment. They were kindly received by this\r\ngentleman and his brown lady, with their interesting family. He at\r\nonce ordered horses for them to proceed to the mission of Maijaijai,\r\nand entertained them with a sumptuous breakfast.\r\n\r\nThey were not prepared to set out before noon, until which time they\r\nstrolled about the town of Santa Cruz, the inhabitants of which\r\nare Tagalogs. There are only two old Spaniards in the place. The\r\nprovince in which Santa Cruz is situated contains about five thousand\r\ninhabitants, of whom eighteen hundred pay tribute.\r\n\r\nThe people have the character of being orderly, and govern themselves\r\nwithout the aid of the military. The principal article of culture is\r\nthe coconut tree, which is seen in large groves. The trunks of these\r\nwere notched, as was supposed, for the purpose of climbing them. From\r\nthe spathe a kind of spirit is manufactured, which is fully as strong\r\nas our whiskey.\r\n\r\nAbout noon they left Don Escudero's, and took a road leading to the\r\nsouthward and eastward, through a luxuriant and beautiful country,\r\nwell cultivated, and ornamented with lofty coconut trees, betel\r\npalms, and banana groves. Several beautiful valleys were passed,\r\nwith streamlets rushing through them.\r\n\r\nMaijaijai is situated about one thousand feet above the Laguna de Bay,\r\nbut the rise is so gradual that it was almost imperceptible. The\r\ncountry has everywhere the appearance of being densely peopled;\r\nbut no more than one village was passed between Santa Cruz and the\r\nmission. They had letters to F. Antonio Romana y Aranda, padre of\r\nthe mission, who received them kindly, and entertained them most\r\nhospitably. [Climbing Banajao.] When he was told of their intention\r\nto visit the mountain, he said it was impossible with such weather,\r\npointing to the black clouds that then enveloped its summit; and he\r\nendeavoured to persuade the gentlemen to desist from what appeared\r\nto him a mad attempt; but finding them resolved to make the trial,\r\nhe aided in making all the necessary preparations, though he had no\r\nbelief in their success.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 27th, after mass, Mr. Eld and Dr. Pickering\r\nset out, but Mr. Sturges preferred to keep the good padre company\r\nuntil their return. The padre had provided them with guides, horses,\r\ntwenty natives, and provisions for three days. He had been himself\r\non the same laborious journey, some six months before, and knew its\r\nfatigues, although it turned out afterwards that his expedition was\r\nperformed in fine weather, and that he had been borne on a litter by\r\nnatives the whole way.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the road was wet and miry, and discouraging\r\nenough. The soil was exceedingly rich, producing tropical plants\r\nin great profusion, in the midst of which were seen the neat bamboo\r\ncottages, with their industrious and cleanly-looking inhabitants. When\r\nthey reached the foot of the mountain, they found it was impossible to\r\nride farther, and were obliged to take to walking, which was, however,\r\nless of a hardship than riding the little rats of horses, covered with\r\nmud and dirt, which were at first deemed useless; but the manner in\r\nwhich they ascended and maintained themselves on the slippery banks,\r\nsurpassed anything they had before witnessed in horseflesh. The first\r\npart of the ascent of the mountain was gradual, but over a miry path,\r\nwhich was extremely slippery; and had it not been for the sticks stuck\r\ndown by the party of the padre in their former ascent, they would have\r\nfound it extremely difficult to overcome; to make it more disagreeable,\r\nit rained all the time.\r\n\r\nIt took about two hours to reach the steep ascent. The last portion\r\nof their route had been through an uninhabited region, with some\r\nopenings in the woods, affording pasture-grounds to a few small herds\r\nof buffalo. In three hours they reached the half-way house, by a very\r\nsteep and regular ascent. Here the natives insisted upon stopping\r\nto cook their breakfast, as they had not yet partaken of anything\r\nthrough the day. The natives now endeavored to persuade them it was\r\nimpracticable to go any farther, or at least to reach the top of the\r\nmountain and return before night. Our gentlemen lost their patience at\r\nthe delay, and after an hour's endurance of it, resolved to set out\r\nalone. Six of the natives followed them, and by half-past three they\r\nreached the summit, where they found it cold and uncomfortable. The\r\nascent had been difficult, and was principally accomplished by catching\r\nhold of shrubs and the roots of trees. The summit is comparatively\r\nbare, and not more than fifty feet in width. The side opposite to\r\nthat by which they mounted was perpendicular, but owing to the thick\r\nfog they could not see the depth to which the precipice descended.\r\n\r\nThe observations with the barometers were speedily taken, which gave\r\nthe height of Banajao as six thousand five hundred feet. The trees\r\non the summit were twenty or thirty feet high, and a species of\r\nfir was very common. Gaultheria, attached to the trunks of trees,\r\nRhododendrons, and Polygonums, also abounded. The rocks were so\r\ncovered with soil that it was difficult to ascertain their character;\r\nDr. Pickering is of opinion, however, that they are not volcanic. The\r\nhouse on the summit afforded them little or no shelter; being a mere\r\nshed, open on all sides, they found it untenantable, and determined\r\nto return as soon as their observations were finished, to the half-way\r\nhouse, which they reached before dark.\r\n\r\nThe night was passed uncomfortably, and in the morning they made\r\nan early start down the mountain to reach the native village at its\r\nfoot, where they were refreshed with a cup of chocolate, cakes, and\r\nsome dulces, according to the custom of the country. At ten o'clock\r\nthey reached the mission, where they were received by the padre and\r\nMr. Sturges. The former was greatly astonished to hear that they\r\nhad really been to the summit, and had accomplished in twenty-four\r\nhours what he had deemed a labor of three days. He quickly attended\r\nto their wants, the first among which was dry clothing; and as their\r\nbaggage had unfortunately been left at Santa Cruz, the wardrobe of\r\nthe rotund padre was placed at their disposal. Although the fit was\r\nrather uncouth on the spare forms of our gentlemen, yet his clothes\r\nserved the purpose tolerably well, and were thankfully made use\r\nof. During their absence, Mr. Sturges had been much amused with the\r\ndiscipline he had witnessed at the hands of the church, which here\r\nseem to be the only visible ruling power. Two young natives had made\r\ncomplaint to the padre that a certain damsel had entered into vows\r\nor engagements to marry both; she was accordingly brought up before\r\nthe padre, Mr. Sturges being present. The padre first lectured her\r\nmost seriously upon the enormity of her crime, then inflicted several\r\nblows on the palm of her outstretched hand, again renewing the lecture,\r\nand finally concluding with another whipping. The girl was pretty, and\r\nexcited the interest of our friend, who looked on with much desire to\r\ninterfere, and save the damsel from the corporal punishment, rendered\r\nmore aggravated by the dispassionate and cool manner in which it and\r\nthe lecture were administered. In the conversation which ensued, the\r\npadre said he had more cases of the violation of the marriage vow,\r\nand of infidelity, than any other class of crimes.\r\n\r\nAfter a hearty breakfast, or rather dinner, and expressing their\r\nthanks to the padre, they rode back to Santa Cruz, where they arrived\r\nat an early hour, and at nine o'clock in the evening they embarked\r\nin their bancas for Manila.\r\n\r\n[Los Baños.] In the morning they found themselves, after a comfortable\r\nnight, at Los Baños. Here they took chocolate with the padre, to whom\r\nMr. Sturges had a letter, who informed them that the other party had\r\nleft the place the evening before for Manila.\r\n\r\nThis party had proceeded to the town of Baia, where they arrived at\r\ndaylight on the 15th. Baia is quite a pretty place, and well situated;\r\nthe houses are clean and comfortable, and it possessed a venerable\r\nstone church, with towers and bells. On inquiring for the padre,\r\nthey found that he was absent, and it was in consequence impossible\r\nfor them to procure horses to proceed to the Volcano of Taal. They\r\ntherefore concluded to walk to the hot springs at Los Baños, about\r\nfive miles distant. Along the road they collected a number of curious\r\nplants. Rice is much cultivated, and fields of it extend to some\r\ndistance on each side of the road. Buffaloes were seen feeding and\r\nwallowing in the ditches.\r\n\r\nAt Los Baños the hot springs are numerous, the water issuing from the\r\nrock over a considerable surface. The quantity of water discharged\r\nby them is large, and the whole is collected and conducted to the\r\nbathing-houses. The temperature of the water at the mouth of the\r\nculvert was 180°.\r\n\r\nThe old bath-house is a singular-looking place, being built on the\r\nhill-side, in the old Spanish style, with large balconies, that are\r\nenclosed in the manner already described, in speaking of the houses\r\nin Manila. It is beautifully situated, and overlooks the baths and\r\nlake. The baths are of stone, and consist of two large rooms, in\r\neach of which is a niche, through which the hot water passes. This\r\nbuilding is now in ruins, the roof and floors having fallen in.\r\n\r\nLos Baños is a small village, but contains a respectable-looking\r\nstone church, and two or three houses of the same material. Here the\r\nparty found a difficulty in getting on, for the alcalde could not\r\nspeak Spanish, and they were obliged to use an interpreter, in order\r\nto communicate with him. Notwithstanding this, he is a magistrate,\r\nwhose duty it is to administer laws written in that language. Finding\r\nthey could not succeed even here in procuring guides or horses,\r\nthey determined to remain and explore Mount Maquiling, the height\r\nof which is three thousand four hundred and fifty feet, and in the\r\nmeantime to send for their bancas.\r\n\r\nThe next day they set out on their journey to that mountain, and the\r\nfirst part of their path lay over a gentle ascent, through cultivated\r\ngrounds. Next succeeded an almost perpendicular hill, bare of trees,\r\nand overgrown with a tall grass, which it was difficult to pass\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the time taken up, that the party found it impossible\r\nto reach the summit and return before dark. They therefore began\r\nto collect specimens; and after having obtained a full load, they\r\nreturned late in the afternoon to Los Baños.\r\n\r\nThe mountain is composed of trachytic rocks and tufa, which are\r\noccasionally seen to break through the rich and deep soil, showing\r\nthemselves here and there, in the deep valleys which former volcanic\r\naction has created, and which have destroyed the regular outline\r\nof the cone-shaped mountain. The tufa is generally found to form\r\nthe gently-sloping plains that surround these mountains, and has in\r\nall probability been ejected from them. Small craters, of some two\r\nhundred feet in height, are scattered over the plains. The tufa is\r\nlikewise exposed to view on the shores of the lake; but elsewhere,\r\nexcept on a few bare hills, it is entirely covered with the dense\r\nand luxuriant foliage. The tufa is generally of a soft character,\r\ncrumbling in the fingers, and in it are found coarse and fine fragments\r\nof scoria, pumice, etc. The layers are from a few inches to five feet\r\nin thickness.\r\n\r\nIn the country around Los Baños, there are several volcanic hills, and\r\non the sides of Mount Maquiling are appearances of parasitic cones,\r\nsimilar to those observed at the Hawaiian Islands; but time and the\r\nfoliage have so disguised them, that it is difficult to determine\r\nexactly their true character.\r\n\r\nI regretted exceedingly that the party that set out for the Lake of\r\nTaal was not able to reach it, as, from the accounts I had, it must\r\nbe one of the most interesting portions of the country. It lies nearly\r\nsouth-west from Manila, and occupies an area of about one hundred and\r\ntwenty square miles. The Volcano of Taal is situated on an island\r\nnear the center of it, and is now in action. The cone which rises\r\nfrom its center is remarkably regular, and consists for the most part\r\nof cinders and scoria. It has been found to be nine hundred feet in\r\nelevation above the lake. The crater has a diameter of two miles,\r\nand its depth is equal to the elevation; the walls of the crater\r\nare nearly perpendicular, so much so that the descent cannot be\r\nmade without the assistance of ropes. At the bottom there are two\r\nsmall cones. Much steam issues from the many fissures, accompanied\r\nby sulphurous acid gas. The waters of the lake are impregnated with\r\nsulphur, and there are said to be also large beds of sulphur. In\r\nthe opinion of those who have visited this spot, the whole lake once\r\nformed an immense crater; and this does not appear very improbable,\r\nif we are to credit the accounts we received of the many craters\r\non this island that are now filled with water; for instance, in the\r\nneighborhood of San Pablo there are said to be eight or nine.\r\n\r\n[The hot springs.] The hot springs of Los Baños are numerous, and in\r\ntheir vicinity large quantities of steam are seen to issue from the\r\nshore of the lake. There are about a dozen which give out a copious\r\nsupply of water. The principal one has been enclosed, and made\r\nto flow through a stone aqueduct, which discharges a considerable\r\nstream. The temperature of the water as it leaves the aqueduct is\r\n178°. The villagers use it for cooking and washing; the signs of the\r\nformer employment are evident enough from the quantities of feathers\r\nfrom the poultry that have been scalded and plucked preparatory to\r\ncooking. The baths are formed by a small circular building six feet\r\nin diameter, erected over the point of discharge for the purpose of\r\nsecuring a steam-bath; the temperature of these is 160° and 140°. A\r\nchange of temperature is said to have occurred in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe rocks in the vicinity are all tufa, and some of the springs break\r\nout close to the cold water of the lake. Near the aqueduct, a stone\r\nwall surrounds one of the principal outlets. Two-thirds of the area\r\nthus enclosed is occupied by a pond of warm water, and the other third\r\nis divided into two stone reservoirs, built for baths. These baths\r\nhad at one time a high reputation, and were a very fashionable resort\r\nfor the society of Manila; but their celebrity gradually diminished,\r\nand the whole premises have gone out of repair, and are fast falling\r\nto ruin.\r\n\r\nThe water of the springs has no perceptible taste, and only a very\r\nfaint smell of sulphur is perceived. No gas escapes from it, but a\r\nwhite incrustation covers the stones over which the water flows.\r\n\r\nSome of these waters were obtained, and since our return were put into\r\nthe hands of Dr. C. T. Jackson, of Boston, who gives the following\r\nanalysis:\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity, 1.0043; thermometer 60°; barometer 30.05 in.\r\n\r\nA quantity of the water, equal in bulk to three thousand grains of\r\ndistilled water, on evaporation gave--\r\n\r\nDry salts, 5.95 grains.\r\n\r\nA quantity of the water, equal in bulk to one thousand grains of\r\ndistilled water, was operated on for each of the following ingredients:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Chlorine            0.66\r\n    Carbonic acid       0.16\r\n    Sulphuric acid      0.03\r\n    Soda and sodium     0.97\r\n    Magnesia            0.09\r\n    Lime                0.07\r\n    Potash              traces\r\n    Organic matter        ,,\r\n    Manganese             ,,\r\n                        ----\r\n                        1.98\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mount Maquiling.] On Mount Maquiling, wild buffaloes, hogs, a small\r\nspecies of deer, and monkeys are found. Birds are also very numerous,\r\nand among them is the horn-bill; the noise made by this bird resembles\r\na loud barking; report speaks of them as an excellent bird for the\r\ntable. Our gentlemen reached their lodging-place as the night closed\r\nin, and the next day again embarked for Manila, regretting that\r\ntime would not permit them to make another visit to so interesting\r\na field of research. They found the lake so rough that they were\r\ncompelled to return, and remain until eight o'clock. This, however,\r\ngave our botanists another opportunity of making collections, among\r\nwhich were beautiful specimens of Volkameria splendens, with elegant\r\nscarlet flowers, and a Brugmansia, which expanded its beautiful\r\nsilvery flowers after sunset. On the shores a number of birds were\r\nfeeding, including pelicans, with their huge bills, the diver, with\r\nits long arched neck, herons, gulls, eagles, and snow-white cranes,\r\nwith ducks and other small aquatic flocks. Towards night these were\r\njoined by large bats, that were seen winging their way towards the\r\nplantations of fruit. These, with quantities of insects, gave a vivid\r\nidea of the wonderful myriads of animated things that are constantly\r\nbrought into being in these tropical and luxuriant climates.\r\n\r\nSailing all night in a rough sea, they were much incommoded by the\r\nwater, which was shipped into the banca and kept them constantly baling\r\nout: they reached the Pasig river at daylight, and again passed the\r\nduck establishments, and the numerous boats and bancas on their way\r\nto the markets of Manila.\r\n\r\nBoth the parties reached the consul's the same day, highly pleased with\r\ntheir respective jaunts. To the kindness of Messrs. Sturges and Moore,\r\nwe are mainly indebted for the advantages and pleasures derived from\r\nthe excursions.\r\n\r\nThe instruments were now embarked, and preparations made for going\r\nto sea. Our stay at Manila had added much to our collections; we\r\nobtained many new specimens, and the officers and naturalists had\r\nbeen constantly and profitably occupied in their various duties.\r\n\r\nWe went on board on January 20, and were accompanied to the vessel\r\nby Messrs. Sturges and Moore, with several other residents of Manila.\r\n\r\nWe had, through the kindness of Captain Salomon, procured a native\r\npilot for the Sulu Sea, who was to act as interpreter.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 21st, we took leave of our friends, and got\r\nunder way. The same day, and before we had cleared the bay, we spoke\r\nthe American ship Angier, which had performed the voyage from the\r\nUnited States in one hundred and twenty-four days, and furnished us\r\nwith late and interesting news. We then, with a strong northerly wind,\r\nmade all sail to the south for the Straits of Mindoro.\r\n\r\n\r\nSulu in 1842\r\n\r\nOn the evening of January 21, the Vincennes, with the tender in\r\ncompany, left Manila bay. I then sent for Mr. Knox, who commanded\r\nthe latter, and gave him directions to keep closely in company with\r\nthe Vincennes, and at the same time pointed out to him places of\r\nrendezvous where the vessels might again meet in case any unavoidable\r\ncircumstance caused their separation. I was more particular in giving\r\nhim instructions to avoid losing sight of the Vincennes, as I was aware\r\nthat my proposed surveys might be impeded or frustrated altogether,\r\nwere I deprived of the assistance of the vessel under his command.\r\n\r\n[Mindoro.] On the 22nd, we passed the entrance of the Straits of San\r\nBernardino. It would have been my most direct route to follow these\r\nstraits until I had passed Mindoro, and it is I am satisfied the safest\r\ncourse, unless the winds are fair, for the direct passage. My object,\r\nhowever, was to examine the ground for the benefit of others, and the\r\nApo Shoal, which lies about mid-channel between Palawan and Mindoro,\r\nclaimed my first attention. The tender was despatched to survey it,\r\nwhile I proceeded in the Vincennes to examine the more immediate\r\nentrance to the Sulu Sea, off the southwest end of Mindoro.\r\n\r\nCalavite Peak is the north point of Mindoro, and our observations\r\nmade it two thousand feet high. This peak is of the shape of a\r\ndome, and appears remarkably regular when seen from its western\r\nside. On approaching Mindoro, we, as is usual, under high islands,\r\nlost the steady breeze, and the wind became light for the rest of\r\nthe day. Mindoro is a beautiful island, and is evidently volcanic;\r\nit appears as if thrown up in confused masses; it is not much settled,\r\nas the more southern islands are preferred to it as a residence.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd, we ascertained the elevation of the highest peak of\r\nthe island by triangulation to be three thousand one hundred and\r\ntwenty-six fet. The easternmost island of the Palawan group, Busuanga,\r\nwas at the time just in sight from the deck, to the southwest.\r\n\r\nIt had been my intention to anchor at Ambolou Island; but the wind\r\ndied away before we reached it, and I determined to stand off and on\r\nall night.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th, I began to experience the truth of what Captain Halcon had\r\nasserted, namely, that the existing charts were entirely worthless,\r\nand I also found that my native pilot was of no more value than\r\nthey were, he had evidently passed the place before; but whether\r\nthe size of the vessel, so much greater than any he had sailed in,\r\nconfused him, or whether it was from his inability to understand and\r\nto make himself understood by us, he was of no use whatever, and we\r\nhad the misfortune of running into shoal water, barely escaping the\r\nbottom. These dangers were usually quickly passed, and we soon found\r\nourselves again floating in thirty or forty fathoms water.\r\n\r\nWe continued beating to windward, in hopes of being joined by the\r\nFlying-fish, and I resolved to finish the survey towards the island\r\nof Semarara. We found every thing in a different position from that\r\nassigned it by any of the charts with which we were furnished. On\r\nthis subject, however, I shall not dwell, but refer those who desire\r\nparticular information to the charts and Hydrographical Memoir.\r\n\r\nTowards evening, I again ran down to the southwest point of the island\r\nof Mindoro, and sent a letter on shore to the pueblo, with directions\r\nto have it put on board the tender, when she should arrive. We then\r\nbegan to beat round Semarara, in order to pass over towards Panay.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of Mindoro is much higher than the northern\r\nbut appears to be equally rough. It is, however, susceptible of\r\ncultivation, and there are many villages along its shores.\r\n\r\nSemarara is moderately high, and about fifteen miles in circumference;\r\nit is inhabited, and like Mindoro much wooded. According to the native\r\npilot, its shores are free from shoals. It was not until the next day\r\nthat we succeeded in reaching Panay. I determined to pass the night\r\noff Point Potol, the north end of Panay, as I believed the sea in its\r\nneighborhood to be free of shoals, and wished to resume our running\r\nsurvey early in the morning.\r\n\r\n[Panay.] At daylight on the 27th we continued the survey down the\r\ncoast of Panay, and succeeded in correcting many errors in the\r\nexisting charts (both English and Spanish). The channel along this\r\nside is from twelve to twenty miles wide, and suitable for beating\r\nin; little current is believed to exist; and the tides, as far as\r\nour observations went, seem to be regular and of little strength.\r\n\r\nThe island of Panay is high and broken, particularly on the south\r\nend; its shores are thickly settled and well cultivated. Indigo and\r\nsugar-cane claim much of the attention of the inhabitants. The natives\r\nare the principal cultivators. They pay to government a capitation tax\r\nof seven reals. Its population is estimated at three hundred thousand,\r\nwhich I think is rather short of the actual number.\r\n\r\nOn all the hills there are telegraphs of rude construction, to give\r\ninformation of the approach of piratical prahus from Sulu, which\r\nformerly were in the habit of making attacks upon the defenceless\r\ninhabitants and carrying them off into slavery. Of late years they have\r\nceased these depredations, for the Spaniards have resorted to a new\r\nmode of warfare. Instead of pursuing and punishing the offenders, they\r\nnow intercept all their supplies, both of necessaries and luxuries;\r\nand the fear of this has had the effect to deter pirates from their\r\nusual attacks.\r\n\r\nWe remained off San Pedro for the night, in hopes of falling in with\r\nthe Flying-fish in the morning.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 28th, the Flying-fish was discovered plainly in\r\nsight. I immediately stood for her, fired a gun and made signal. At\r\nseven o'clock, another gun was fired, but the vessel still stood off,\r\nand was seen to make sail to the westward without paying any regard\r\nwhatever to either, and being favored by a breeze while the Vincennes\r\nwas becalmed, she stole off and was soon out of sight. [270]\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we opened the bay of Antique, on which is situated the\r\ntown of San José. As this bay apparently offered anchorage for vessels\r\nbound up this coast, I determined to survey it; and for this purpose\r\nthe boats were hoisted out and prepared for surveying. Lieutenant\r\nBudd was despatched to visit the pueblo called San José.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the bay, the boats were sent to different points of it,\r\nand when they were in station, the ship fired guns to furnish bases\r\nby the sound, and angles were simultaneously measured. The boats made\r\nsoundings on their return to the ship, and thus completed this duty,\r\nso that in an hour or two afterwards the bay was correctly represented\r\non paper. It offers no more than a temporary anchorage for vessels,\r\nand unless the shore is closely approached, the water is almost too\r\ndeep for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[San José.] At San José a Spanish governor resides, who presides over\r\nthe two pueblos of San Pedro and San José, and does the duty also\r\nof alcalde. Lieutenant Budd did not see him, as he was absent, but\r\nhis lady did the honors. Lieutenant Budd represented the pueblo as\r\ncleanly and orderly. About fifteen soldiers were seen, who compose\r\nthe governor's guard, and more were said to be stationed at San\r\nPedro. A small fort of eight guns commands the roadstead. The beach\r\nwas found to be of fine volcanic sand, composed chiefly of oxide of\r\niron, and comminuted shells; there is here also a narrow shore reef\r\nof coral. The plain bordering the sea is covered with a dense growth\r\nof coconut trees. In the fine season the bay is secure, but we were\r\ninformed that in westerly and southwesterly gales heavy seas set in,\r\nand vessels are not able to lie at anchor. Several small vessels were\r\nlying in a small river about one and a half miles to the southward of\r\nthe point on which the fort is situated. The entrance to this river\r\nis very narrow and tortuous.\r\n\r\nPanay is one of the largest islands of the group. We had an opportunity\r\nof measuring the height of some of its western peaks or highlands,\r\nnone of which exceed three thousand feet. The interior and eastern side\r\nhave many lofty summits, which are said to reach an altitude of seven\r\nthousand five hundred feet; but these, as we passed, were enveloped\r\nin clouds, or shut out from view by the nearer highlands. The general\r\nfeatures of the island are like those of Luzon and Mindoro. The few\r\nspecimens we obtained of its rocks consisted of the different varieties\r\nof talcose formation, with quartz and jasper. The specimens were of\r\nno great value, as they were much worn by lying on the beach.\r\n\r\nThe higher land was bare of trees, and had it not been for the\r\nnumerous fertile valleys lying between the sharp and rugged spurs,\r\nit would have had a sterile appearance.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Antique is in latitude 10° 40' N., longitude 121° 59'\r\n30'' E.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to remain for two or three days at a convenient\r\nanchorage to enable us to make short excursions into the interior;\r\nbut the vexatious mismanagement of the tender now made it incumbent\r\nthat I should make every possible use of the time to complete the\r\noperations connected with the hydrography of this sea; for I perceived\r\nthat the duties which I intended should be performed by her, would now\r\ndevolve upon the boats, and necessarily expose both officers and men to\r\nthe hazard of contracting disease. I regretted giving up this design,\r\nnot only on my own account and that of the Expedition, but because of\r\nthe gratification it would have afforded personally to the naturalists.\r\n\r\nThe town of San José has about thirty bamboo houses, some of which\r\nare filled in with clay or mortar, and plastered over, both inside\r\nand out. Few of them are more than a single story in height. That of\r\nthe governor is of the same material, and overtops the rest; it is\r\nwhitewashed, and has a neat and cleanly appearance. In the vicinity of\r\nthe town are several beautiful valleys, which run into the mountains\r\nfrom the plain that borders the bay. The landing is on a bamboo bridge,\r\nwhich has been erected over an extensive mud-flat, that is exposed at\r\nlow water, and prevents any nearer approach of boats. This bridge is\r\nabout seven hundred feet in length; and a novel plan has been adopted\r\nto preserve it from being carried away. The stems of bamboo not\r\nbeing sufficiently large and heavy to maintain the superstructure in\r\nthe soft mud, a scaffold is constructed just under the top, which is\r\nloaded with blocks of large stone, and the outer piles are secured to\r\nanchors or rocks, with grass rope. The roadway or top is ten feet wide,\r\ncovered with split bamboo, woven together, and has rails on each side,\r\nto assist the passenger. This is absolutely necessary for safety;\r\nand even with this aid, one unaccustomed to it must be possessed\r\nof no little bodily strength to pass over this smooth, slippery,\r\nand springy bridge, without accident.\r\n\r\nTwo pirogues were at anchor in the bay, and on the shore was the\r\nframe of a vessel which had evidently been a long while on the stocks,\r\nfor the weeds and bushes near the keel were six or eight feet high,\r\nand a portion of the timbers were decayed. Carts and sleds drawn by\r\nbuffaloes were in use, and everything gave it the appearance of a\r\nthriving village. Although I have mentioned the presence of soldiers,\r\nit was observed on landing that no guard was stationed about or even at\r\nthe fort; but shortly afterwards a soldier was seen hurrying towards\r\nthe latter, in the act of dressing himself in his regimentals, and\r\nanother running by his side, with his cartridge-box and musket. In\r\na little while one was passing up and down on his post, as though he\r\nwas as permanent there as the fort itself.\r\n\r\nAfter completing these duties, the light airs detained us the remainder\r\nof the day under Panay, in sight of the bay. On the 29th, at noon,\r\nwe had been wafted by it far enough in the offing to obtain the\r\neasterly breeze, which soon became strong, with an overcast sky,\r\nand carried us rapidly on our course; my time would not permit my\r\nheaving-to. We kept on our course for Mindanao during the whole night,\r\nand were constantly engaged in sounding, with our patent lead, with\r\nfrom thirty to forty fathoms cast, to prevent our passing over this\r\npart of the sea entirely unexamined.\r\n\r\n[Mindanao.] At daylight on the 31st, we had the island of Mindanao\r\nbefore us, but did not reach its western cape until 5 p.m. This island\r\nis high and broken, like those to the north of it, but, unlike them,\r\nits mountains are covered with forests to their very tops, and there\r\nwere no distinct cones of minor dimensions, as we had observed on\r\nthe others. If they do exist, they were hidden by the dense forest.\r\n\r\nI had determined to anchor at Caldera, a small port on the south-west\r\nside of Mindanao, about ten miles distant from Zamboanga, where the\r\ngovernor resides. The latter is a considerable place, but the anchorage\r\nin its roadstead is said to be bad, and the currents that run through\r\nthe Straits of Basilan are represented to be strong. Caldera, on the\r\nother hand, has a good, though small anchorage, which is free from the\r\ncurrents of the straits. It is therefore an excellent stopping-place,\r\nin case of the tide proving unfavorable. On one of its points stands\r\na small fort, which, on our arrival, hoisted Spanish colors.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock we came to anchor at Caldera, in seven fathoms\r\nwater. There were few indications of inhabitants, except at and\r\nnear the fort. An officer was despatched to the fort, to report the\r\nship. It was found to be occupied by a few soldiers under the command\r\nof a lieutenant.\r\n\r\n[Caldera fort.] The fort is about seventy feet square, and is built\r\nof large blocks of red coral, which evidently have not been taken from\r\nthe vicinity of the place, as was stated by the officers of the fort;\r\nfor although our parties wandered along the alluvial beach for two or\r\nthree miles in each direction, no signs of coral were observed. Many\r\nfragments of red, gray, and purple basalt and porphyry were met with\r\nalong the beach; talcose rock and slate, syenite, hornblend, quartz,\r\nboth compact and slaty, with chalcedony, were found in pieces and\r\nlarge pebbles. Those who were engaged in dredging reported the bottom\r\nas being of coral, in from four to six or eight fathoms; but this\r\nwas of a different kind from that of which the fort was constructed.\r\n\r\nThe fort was built in the year 1784, principally for protection against\r\nthe Sulu pirates, who were in the habit of visiting the settlements,\r\nand carrying off the inhabitants as slaves, to obtain ransom for\r\nthem. This, and others of the same description, were therefore\r\nconstructed as places of refuge for the inhabitants, as well as to\r\nafford protection to vessels.\r\n\r\nDepredations are still committed, which render it necessary to keep\r\nup a small force. One or two huts which were seen in the neighborhood\r\nof the bay, are built on posts twenty feet from the ground, and into\r\nthem they ascend by ladders, which are hauled up after the occupants\r\nhave entered.\r\n\r\nThese, it is said, are the sleeping-huts, and are so built for the\r\npurpose of preventing surprise at night. Before our arrival we had\r\nheard that the villages were all so constructed, but a visit to one\r\nsoon showed that this was untrue. The natives seen at the village\r\nwere thought to be of a decidedly lighter color and a somewhat\r\ndifferent expression from the Malays. They were found to be very\r\ncivil, and more polished in manners than our gentlemen expected. On\r\nasking for a drink of water, it was brought in a glass tumbler on a\r\nchina plate. An old woman, to whom they had presented some trifles,\r\ntook the trouble to meet them in another path on their return, and\r\ninsisted on their accepting a basket of potatoes. Some of the houses\r\ncontained several families, and many of them had no other means of\r\nentrance than a notched post stuck up to the door.\r\n\r\nThe forests of Mindanao contain a great variety of trees, some of\r\nwhich are of large size, rising to the height of one hundred and\r\nand one hundred and fifty feet. Some of their trunks are shaped like\r\nbuttresses, similar to those before spoken of at Manila, from which\r\nthey obtain broad slabs for the tops of tables. The trunks were\r\nobserved to shoot up remarkably straight. Our botanical gentlemen,\r\nthough pleased with the excursion, were disappointed at not being\r\nable to procure specimens from the lofty trees; and the day was less\r\nproductive in this respect than they had anticipated. Large woody\r\nvines were common, which enveloped the trunks of trees in their folds,\r\nand ascending to their tops, prevented the collection of the most\r\ndesirable specimens.\r\n\r\nThe paths leading to the interior were narrow and much obstructed;\r\none fine stream was crossed. Many buffaloes were observed wallowing\r\nin the mire, and the woods swarmed with monkeys and numbers of birds,\r\namong them the horn-bills; these kept up a continued chatter, and made\r\na variety of loud noises. The forests here are entirely different from\r\nany we had seen elsewhere; and the stories of their being the abode\r\nof large boas and poisonous snakes, make the effect still greater\r\non those who visit them for the first time. Our parties, however,\r\nsaw nothing of these reptiles, nor anything to warrant a belief that\r\nsuch exist. Yet the officer at the fort related to me many snake\r\nstories that seemed to have some foundation; and by inquiries made\r\nelsewhere, I learned that they were at least warranted by some facts,\r\nthough probably not to the extent that he represented.\r\n\r\nTraces of deer and wild hogs were seen, and many birds were obtained,\r\nas well as land and sea shells. Among the latter was the Malleus\r\nvulgaris, which is used as food by the natives. The soil on this\r\npart of the island is a stiff clay, and the plants it produces\r\nare mostly woody; those of an herbaceous character were scarce,\r\nand only a few orchideous epiphytes and ferns were seen. Around the\r\ndwellings in the villages were a variety of vegetables and fruits,\r\nconsisting of sugar-cane, sweet-potato, gourds, pumpkins, peppers,\r\nrice, water and musk melons, all fine and of large size.\r\n\r\nThe officer at the fort was a lieutenant of infantry; one of that rank\r\nis stationed here for a month, after which he, with the garrison,\r\nconsisting of three soldiers, are relieved, from Zamboanga, where\r\nthe Spaniards have three companies.\r\n\r\n[Zamboanga.] Zamboanga is a convict settlement, to which the native\r\nrogues, principally thieves, are sent. The Spanish criminals, as I\r\nhave before stated in speaking of Manila, are sent to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the island of Mindanao, who are under the subjection\r\nof Spain, are about ten thousand in number, of whom five or six\r\nthousand are at or in the neighborhood of Zamboanga. The original\r\ninhabitants, who dwell in the mountains and on the east coast, are\r\nsaid to be quite black, and are represented to be a very cruel and\r\nbad set; they have hitherto bid defiance to all attempts to subjugate\r\nthem. When the Spaniards make excursions into the interior, which is\r\nseldom, they always go in large parties on account of the wild beasts,\r\nserpents, and hostile natives; nevertheless, the latter frequently\r\nattack and drive them back.\r\n\r\nThe little fort is considered as a sufficient protection for the\r\nfishermen and small vessels against the pirates, who inhabit the\r\nisland of Basilan, which is in sight from Mindanao, and forms the\r\nsouthern side of the straits of the same name. It is said that about\r\nseven hundred inhabit it. The name of Moro is given by the Spaniards\r\nto all those who profess the Mohammedan religion, and by such all the\r\nislands to the west of Mindanao, and known under the name of the Sulu\r\narchipelago, are inhabited.\r\n\r\nThe day we spent at Caldera was employed in surveying the bay, and\r\nin obtaining observations for its geographical position, and for\r\nmagnetism. The flood tide sets to the northward and westward, through\r\nthe straits, and the ebb to the eastward. In the bay we found it to\r\nrun two miles an hour by the log, but it must be much more rapid in\r\nthe straits.\r\n\r\nAt daylight on February 1st, we got under way to stand over for\r\nthe Sangboys, a small island with two sharp hills on it. One and a\r\nhalf miles from the bay we passed over a bank, the least water on\r\nwhich was ten fathoms on a sandy bottom, and on which a vessel might\r\nanchor. The wind shortly after failed us, and we drifted with the tide\r\nfor some hours, in full view of the island of Mindanao, which is bold\r\nand picturesque. We had thus a good opportunity of measuring some of\r\nits mountain ranges, which we made about three thousand feet high.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, a light breeze came from the southwest, and before\r\nsunset I found that we were again on soundings. As soon as we had\r\na cast of twenty fathoms, I anchored for the night, judging it much\r\nbetter than to be drifting about without any knowledge of the locality\r\nand currents to which we were subjected.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 2nd, we got under way to proceed to the\r\nwestward. As the bottom was unequal, I determined to pass through\r\nthe broadest channel, although it had the appearance of being the\r\nshoalest, and sent two boats ahead to sound. In this way we passed\r\nthrough, continuing our surveying operations, and at the same time\r\nmade an attempt to dredge; but the ground was too uneven for the\r\nlatter purpose, and little of value was obtained.\r\n\r\n[Sulu.] Shortly after passing the Sangboys, we had the island of\r\nSulu in sight, for which I now steered direct. At sunset we found\r\nourselves within five or six miles of Soung Harbor; but there was not\r\nsufficient light to risk the dangers that might be in our course,\r\nnor wind enough to command the ship; and having no bottom where we\r\nwere, I determined again to run out to sea, and anchor on the first\r\nbank I should meet. At half-past eight o'clock, we struck sounding\r\nin twenty-six fathoms, and anchored.\r\n\r\nAt daylight we determined our position by angles, and found it\r\nto correspond with part of the route we had passed over the day\r\nbefore, and that we were about fifteen miles from the large island\r\nof Sulu. Weighing anchor, we were shortly wafted by the westerly\r\ntide and a light air towards that beautiful island, which lay in the\r\nmidst of its little archipelago; and as we were brought nearer and\r\nnearer, we came to the conclusion that in our many wanderings we had\r\nseen nothing to be compared to this enchanting spot. It appeared to\r\nbe well cultivated, with gentle slopes rising here and there into\r\neminences from one to two thousand feet high. One or two of these\r\nmight be dignified with the name of mountains, and were sufficiently\r\nhigh to arrest the passing clouds; on the afternoon of our arrival\r\nwe had a singular example in the dissipation of a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nAlthough much of the island was under cultivation, yet it had all the\r\nfreshness of a forest region. The many smokes on the hills, buildings\r\nof large size, cottages, and cultivated spots, together with the\r\nmoving crowds on the land, the prahus, canoes, and fishing-boats on\r\nthe water gave the whole a civilized appearance. Our own vessel lay,\r\nalmost without a ripple at her side, on the glassy surface of the\r\nsea, carried onwards to our destined anchorage by the flowing tide,\r\nand scarce a sound was heard except the splashing of the lead as\r\nit sought the bottom. The effect of this was destroyed in part by\r\nthe knowledge that this beautiful archipelago was the abode of a\r\ncruel and barbarous race of pirates. Towards sunset we had nearly\r\nreached the bay of Soung, when we were met by the opposing tide,\r\nwhich frustrated all our endeavors to reach it, and I was compelled\r\nto anchor, lest we should again be swept to sea.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the night set in, fishermen's lights were seen moving along\r\nthe beach in all directions, and gliding about in canoes, while the sea\r\nwas filled with myriads of phosphorescent animalcula. After watching\r\nthis scene for two or three hours in the calm and still night, a storm\r\nthat had been gathering reached us; but it lasted only for a short\r\ntime, and cleared off after a shower, which gave the air a freshness\r\nthat was delightful after the sultry heat we had experienced during\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nThe canoes of this archipelago were found to be different from any\r\nthat we had heretofore seen, not only in shape, but in making use\r\nof a double outrigger, which consequently must give them additional\r\nsecurity. The paddle also is of a different shape, and has a blade at\r\neach end, which are used alternately, thus enabling a single person to\r\nmanage them with ease. These canoes are made of a single log, though\r\nsome are built upon. They seldom carry more than two persons. The\r\nfigure on the opposite page will give a correct idea of one of them.\r\n\r\nWe saw the fishermen engaged in trolling and using the line; but the\r\nmanner of taking fish which has been heretofore described is chiefly\r\npractised. In fishing, as well as in all their other employments,\r\nthe kris and spear were invariably by their side.\r\n\r\n[Sulu harbor.] The next morning at eight o'clock we got under way,\r\nand were towed by our boats into the bay of Soung, where we anchored\r\noff the town in nine fathoms water. While in the act of doing so,\r\nand after our intentions had become too evident to admit of a doubt,\r\nthe Sultan graciously sent off a message giving us permission to\r\nenter his port.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Budd was immediately despatched with the interpreter to call\r\nupon the Datu Mulu or governor, and to learn at what hour we could see\r\nthe Sultan. When the officer reached the town, all were found asleep;\r\nand after remaining four hours waiting, the only answer he could get\r\nout of the Datu Mulu was, that he supposed that the Sultan would be\r\nawake at three o'clock, when he thought I could see him.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the boats had been prepared for surveying; and after\r\nlanding the naturalists, they began the work.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time, Captain Hudson and myself went on shore to wait\r\nupon the Sultan. On our approach to the town, we found that a great\r\nproportion of it was built over the water on piles, and only connected\r\nwith the shore by narrow bridges of bamboo. The style of building in\r\nSulu does not differ materially from that of the Malays. The houses\r\nare rather larger, and they surpass the others in filth.\r\n\r\n[Pirate craft.] We passed for some distance between the bridges to\r\nthe landing, and on our way saw several piratical prahus apparently\r\nlaid up. Twenty of these were counted, of about thirty tons burden,\r\nevidently built for sea-vessels, and capable of mounting one or two\r\nlong guns. We landed at a small streamlet, and walked a short distance\r\nto the Datu's house, which is of large dimensions and rudely built on\r\npiles, which raise it about six feet above the ground, and into which\r\nwe were invited. The house of the Datu contains one room, part of which\r\nis screened off to form the apartment of his wife. Nearly in the center\r\nis a raised dais, eight or ten feet square, under which are stowed\r\nall his valuables, packed in chests and Chinese trunks. Upon this\r\ndais are placed mats for sleeping, with cushions, pillows, etc.; and\r\nover it is a sort of canopy, hung around with fine chintz or muslin.\r\n\r\nThe dais was occupied by the Datu, who is, next to the Sultan, the\r\ngreatest man of this island. He at once came from it to receive us, and\r\nhad chairs provided for us near his sanctum. After we were seated, he\r\nagain retired to his lounge. The Datu is small in person, and emaciated\r\nin form, but has a quick eye and an intelligent countenance. He\r\nlives, as he told me, with all his goods around him, and they formed\r\na collection such as I could scarcely imagine it possible to bring\r\ntogether in such a place. The interior put me in mind of a barn\r\ninhabited by a company of strolling players. On one side were hung up\r\na collection of various kinds of gay dresses, here drums and gongs,\r\nthere swords, lanterns, spears, muskets, and small cannon; on another\r\nside were shields, buckler, masks, saws, and wheels, with belts, bands,\r\nand long robes. The whole was a strange mixture of tragedy and farce;\r\nand the group of natives were not far removed in appearance from the\r\nsupernumeraries that a Turkish tragedy might have brought together in\r\nthe green-room of a theatre. A set of more cowardly-looking miscreants\r\nI never saw. They appeared ready either to trade with us, pick our\r\npockets, or cut our throats, as an opportunity might offer.\r\n\r\nThe wife's apartment was not remarkable for its comforts, although\r\nthe Datu spoke of it with much consideration, and evidently held his\r\nbetter half in high estimation. He was also proud of his six children,\r\nthe youngest of whom he brought out in its nurse's arms, and exhibited\r\nwith much pride and satisfaction. He particularly drew my attention\r\nto its little highly-wrought and splendidly-mounted kris, which was\r\nstuck through its girdle, as an emblem of his rank. He was in reality a\r\nfine-looking child. The kitchen was behind the house, and occupied but\r\na small space, for they have little in the way of food that requires\r\nmuch preparation. The house of the Datu might justly be termed nasty.\r\n\r\nWe now learned the reason why the Sultan could not be seen; it was\r\nFriday, the Mahomedan Sabbath, and he had been at the mosque from\r\nan early hour. Lieutenant Budd had been detained, because it was not\r\nknown when he would finish his prayers; and the ceremonies of the day\r\nwere more important than usual, on account of its peculiar sanctity\r\nin their calendar.\r\n\r\n[Visiting the Sultan.] Word had been sent off to the ship that the\r\nSultan was ready to receive me, but the messenger passed us while on\r\nour way to shore. After we had been seated for a while, the Datu asked\r\nif we were ready to accompany him to see the Sultan; but intimated\r\nthat no one but Captain Hudson and myself could be permitted to\r\nlay eyes on him. Being informed that we were, he at once, and in\r\nour presence, slipped on his silken trousers, and a new jacket,\r\ncovered with bell-buttons; put on his slippers, strapped himself\r\nround with a long silken net sash, into which he stuck his kris, and,\r\nwith umbrella in hand, said he was ready. He now led the way out of\r\nhis house, leaving the motley group behind, and we took the path to\r\nthe interior of the town, towards the Sultan's. The Datu and I walked\r\nhand in hand, on a roadway about ten feet wide, with a small stream\r\nrunning on each side. Captain Hudson and the interpreter came next,\r\nand a guard of six trusty slaves brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the outskirts of the town, about half a mile from\r\nthe Datu's, we came to the Sultan's residence, where he was prepared\r\nto receive us in state. His house is constructed in the same manner\r\nas that of the Datu, but is of larger dimensions, and the piles are\r\nrather higher. Instead of steps, we found a ladder, rudely constructed\r\nof bamboo, and very crazy. This was so steep that it was necessary to\r\nuse the hands in mounting it. I understood that the ladder was always\r\nremoved in the night, for the sake of security. We entered at once\r\ninto the presence-chamber, where the whole divan, if such it may be\r\ncalled, sat in arm-chairs, occupying the half of a large round table,\r\ncovered with a white cotton cloth. On the opposite side of the table,\r\nseats were placed for us. On our approach, the Sultan and all his\r\ncouncil rose, and motioned us to our seats. When we had taken them,\r\nthe part of the room behind us was literally crammed with well-armed\r\nmen. A few minutes were passed in silence, during which time we\r\nhad an opportunity of looking at each other, and around the hall in\r\nwhich we were seated. The latter was of very common workmanship, and\r\nexhibited no signs of oriental magnificence. Overhead hung a printed\r\ncotton cloth, forming a kind of tester, which covered about half of\r\nthe apartment. In other places the roof and rafters were visible. A\r\npart of the house was roughly partitioned off, to the height of nine\r\nor ten feet, enclosing, as I was afterwards told, the Sultan's sleeping\r\napartment, and that appropriated to his wife and her attendants.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan is of middle height, spare and thin; he was dressed in a\r\nwhite cotton shirt, loose trousers of the same material, and slippers;\r\nhe had no stockings; the bottom of his trousers was worked in scollops\r\nwith blue silk, and this was the only ornament I saw about him. On his\r\nhead he wore a small colored cotton handkerchief, wound into a turban,\r\nthat just covered the top of his head. His eyes were bloodshot, and had\r\nan uneasy wild look, showing that he was under the effects of opium,\r\nof which they all smoke large quantities. His teeth were as black as\r\nebony, which, with his bright cherry-colored lips, [271] contrasted\r\nwith his swarthy skin, gave him anything but a pleasant look.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the Sultan sat his two sons, while his right\r\nwas occupied by his councillors; just behind him, sat the carrier\r\nof his betel-nut casket. The casket was of filigree silver, about\r\nthe size of a small tea-caddy, of oblong shape, and rounded at the\r\ntop. It had three divisions, one for the leaf, another for the nut,\r\nand a third for the lime. Next to this official was the pipe-bearer,\r\nwho did not appear to be held in such estimation as the former.\r\n\r\n[Treaty with United States.] I opened the conversation by desiring\r\nthat the Datu would explain the nature of our visit, and tell the\r\nSultan that I had come to make the treaty which he had some time\r\nbefore desired to form with the United States. [272]\r\n\r\nThe Sultan replied that such was still his desire; upon which I told\r\nhim I would draw one up for him that same day. While I was explaining\r\nto him the terms, a brass candlestick was brought in with a lighted\r\ntallow candle, of a very dark color, and rude shape, that showed\r\nbut little art in the manufacture. This was placed in the center\r\nof the table, with a plate of Manila cigars. None of them, however,\r\nwere offered to us, nor any kind of refreshment.\r\n\r\nOur visit lasted nearly an hour. When we arose to take our leave,\r\nthe Sultan and his divan did the same, and we made our exit with low\r\nbows on each side.\r\n\r\nI looked upon it as a matter of daily occurrence for all those\r\nwho came to the island to visit the Sultan; but the Datu Mulu took\r\ngreat pains to make me believe that a great favor had been granted in\r\nallowing us a sight of his ruler. On the other hand, I dwelt upon the\r\ncondescension it was on my part to visit him, and I refused to admit\r\nthat I was under any gratitude or obligation for the sight of His\r\nMajesty the Sultan Mohammed Damaliel Kisand, but said that he might\r\nfeel grateful to me if he signed the treaty I would prepare for him.\r\n\r\nOn our return from the Sultan's to the Datu Mulu's house, we found\r\neven a greater crowd than before. The Datu, however, contrived to\r\nget us seats. The attraction which drew it together was to look at\r\nMr. Agate, who was taking a sketch of Mohammed Polalu, the Sultan's\r\nson, and next heir to the throne. I had hoped to procure one of the\r\nSultan, but this was declared to be impossible.\r\n\r\nThe son, however, has all the characteristics of the Sulu, and\r\nthe likeness was thought an excellent one. Mohammed Polalu is about\r\ntwenty-three years of age, of a tall slender figure, with a long face,\r\nheavy and dull eyes, as though he was constantly under the influence\r\nof opium. So much, indeed, was he addicted to the use of this drug,\r\neven according to the Datu Mulu's accounts, that his strength and\r\nconstitution were very much impaired. As he is kept particularly\r\nunder the guardianship of the Datu, the latter has a strong interest\r\nin preserving this influence over him, and seems on this account to\r\nafford him every opportunity of indulging in this deplorable habit.\r\n\r\nDuring our visit, the effects of a pipe of this drug were seen upon\r\nhim; for but a short time after he had reclined himself on the Datu's\r\ncouch and cushion, and taken a few whiffs, he was entirely overcome,\r\nstupid, and listless. I had never seen any one so young, bearing\r\nsuch evident marks of the effects of this deleterious drug. When\r\nbut partially recovered from its effects he called for his betelnut,\r\nto revive him by its exciting effects. This was carefully chewed by\r\nhis attendant to a proper consistency, moulded in a ball about the\r\nsize of a walnut, and then slipped into the mouth of the heir apparent.\r\n\r\n[Interior travel prohibited.] One of the requests I had made of the\r\nSultan was, that the officers might have guides to pass over the\r\nisland. This was at once said to be too dangerous to be attempted, as\r\nthe datus of the interior and southern towns would in all probability\r\nattack the parties. I understood what this meant, and replied that\r\nI was quite willing to take the responsibility, and that the party\r\nshould be well armed. To this the Sultan replied that he would\r\nnot risk his own men. This I saw was a mere evasion, but it was\r\ndifficult and would be dangerous for our gentlemen to proceed alone,\r\nand I therefore said no more. On our return to the Datu's, I gave\r\nthem permission to get as far from the beach as they could, but I was\r\nafterwards informed by them that in endeavoring to penetrate into the\r\nwoods, they were always stopped by armed men. This was also the case\r\nwhen they approached particular parts of the town, but they were not\r\nmolested as long as their rambles were confined to the beach. At the\r\nDatu's we were treated to chocolate and negus in gilt-edged tumblers,\r\nwith small stale cakes, which had been brought from Manila.\r\n\r\nAfter we had sat some time I was informed that Mr. Dana missed his\r\nbowie-knife pistol, which he had for a moment laid down on a chest. I\r\nat once came to the conclusion that it had been stolen, and as the\r\ntheft had occurred in the Datu's house, I determined to hold him\r\nresponsible for it, and gave him at once to understand that I should\r\ndo so, informing him that the pistol must be returned before the next\r\nmorning, or he must take the consequences. This threw him into some\r\nconsternation, and by my manner he felt that I was serious.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hudson and myself, previous to our return on board, visited\r\nthe principal parts of the town. The Chinese quarter is separated\r\nby a body of water, and has a gateway that leads to a bridge. The\r\nbridge is covered by a roof, and on each side of it are small shops,\r\nwhich are open in front, and thus expose the goods they contain. In\r\nthe rear of the shops were the dwellings of the dealers. This sort\r\nof bazaar contained but a very scanty assortment, and the goods were\r\nof inferior quality.\r\n\r\nWe visited some blacksmith-shops, where they were manufacturing krises\r\nand spears. These shops were open sheds; the fire was made upon the\r\nground, and two wooden cylinders, whose valves were in the bottom,\r\nserved for bellows; when used, they had movable pistons, which were\r\nworked by a man on an elevated seat, and answered the purpose better\r\nthan could have been expected.\r\n\r\nThe kris is a weapon in which this people take great pride; it is of\r\nvarious shapes and sizes, and is invariably worn from infancy to old\r\nage; they are generally wavy in their blades, and are worn in wooden\r\nscabbards, which are neatly made and highly polished.\r\n\r\nThe market was well stocked with fruit and fish. Among the former the\r\ndurian seemed to predominate; this was the first time we had seen\r\nit. It has a very disagreeable odour, as if decayed, and appears\r\nto emit a sulphuretted hydrogen gas, which I observed blackened\r\nsilver. Some have described this fruit as delicious, but if the\r\nsmell is not enough, the taste in my opinion will convince any one\r\nof the contrary.\r\n\r\nMr. Brackenridge made the following list of their fruits: Durian,\r\nArtocarpus integrifolia, Melons, water and musk, Oranges, mandarin\r\nand bitter, Pineapples, Carica papaya, Mangosteen, Bread-fruit,\r\nCoco and Betelnut. The vegetables were capsicums, cucumbers, yams,\r\nsweet-potatoes, garlic, onions, edible fern-roots, and radishes of\r\nthe salmon variety, but thicker and more acrid in flavor.\r\n\r\n[A stolen granite monument.] In walking about the parts of the town we\r\nwere permitted to enter, large slabs of cut granite were seen, which\r\nwere presumed to be from China, where the walls of canals or streamlets\r\nare lined with it. But Dr. Pickering in his rambles discovered pieces\r\nthat had been cut as if to form a monument, and remarked a difference\r\nbetween it and the Chinese kind. On one or two pieces he saw the mark\r\nNo. 1, in black paint; the material resembled the Chelmsford granite,\r\nand it occurred to him that the stone had been cut in Boston. I\r\ndid not hear of this circumstance until after we had left Sulu, and\r\nhave little doubt now that the interdiction against our gentlemen\r\nvisiting some parts of the town was owing to the fear they had of the\r\ndiscovery of this plunder. This may have been the reason why they so\r\nreadily complied with my demands, in order to get rid of us as soon as\r\npossible, feeling themselves guilty, and being unprepared for defence;\r\nfor, of the numerous guns mounted, few if any were serviceable.\r\n\r\nThe theft of the pistol was so barefaced an affair, that I made up\r\nmy mind to insist on its restoration. At the setting of the watch\r\nin the evening, it had been our practice on board the Vincennes to\r\nfire a small brass howitzer. This frequently, in the calm evenings,\r\nproduced a great reverberation, and rolled along the water to the\r\nsurrounding islands with considerable noise. Instead of it, on this\r\nevening, I ordered one of the long guns to be fired, believing that\r\nthe sound and reverberation alone would suffice to intimidate such\r\nrobbers. One was accordingly fired in the direction of the town,\r\nwhich fairly shook the island, as they said, and it was not long\r\nbefore we saw that the rogues were fully aroused, for the clatter of\r\ngongs and voices that came over the water, and the motion of lights,\r\nconvinced me that the pistol would be forthcoming in the morning. In\r\nthis I was not mistaken, for at early daylight I was awakened by a\r\nspecial messenger from the Datu to tell me that the pistol was found,\r\nand would be brought off without delay; that he had been searching for\r\nit all night, and had at last succeeded in finding it, as well as the\r\nthief, on whom he intended to inflict the bastinado. Accordingly, in\r\na short time the pistol was delivered on board, and every expression\r\nof friendship and good-will given, with the strongest assurances that\r\nnothing of the kind should happen again.\r\n\r\n[Marongas island.] As our naturalists could have no opportunity\r\nof rambling over the island of Sooloo, it was thought that one\r\nof the neighbouring islands (although not so good a field) would\r\nafford them many of the same results, and that they could examine\r\nit unmolested. Accordingly, at an early hour, they were despatched\r\nin boats for that purpose, with a sufficient guard to attend them\r\nin case of necessity. The island on which they landed, Marongas,\r\nhas two hills of volcanic conglomerate and vesicular lava, containing\r\nangular fragments embedded. The bottom was covered with living coral,\r\nof every variety, and of different colors; but there was nothing like\r\na regular coral shelf, and the beach was composed of bits of coral\r\nintermixed with dead shells, both entire and comminuted. The center\r\nof the island was covered with mangrove-bushes; the hills were cones,\r\nbut had no craters on them. The mangroves had grown in clusters,\r\ngiving the appearance of a number of small islets. This, with the\r\nneighboring islands, were thought to be composed in a great part of\r\ncoral, but it was impossible for our gentlemen to determine the fact.\r\n\r\nThe day was exceedingly hot, and the island was suffering to such\r\na degree from drought that the leaves in many cases were curled and\r\nappeared dry. On the face of the rocky cliff they saw many swallows\r\n(hirundo esculenta) flying in and out of the caverns facing the sea;\r\nbut they were not fortunate enough to find any of the edible nests,\r\nso much esteemed by Chinese epicures.\r\n\r\nAt another part of the island they heard the crowing of a cock,\r\nand discovered a small village, almost hidden by the mangroves, and\r\nbuilt over the water. In the neighborhood were several fish-baskets\r\nset out to dry, as well as a quantity of fencing for weirs, all made\r\nof rattan. Their shape was somewhat peculiar. After a little while the\r\nnative fishermen were seen approaching, who evidently had a knowledge\r\nof their visit from the first. They came near with great caution\r\nin their canoes; but after the first had spoken and reconnoitered,\r\nseveral others landed, exhibiting no signs of embarrassment, and soon\r\nmotioned our party off. To indicate that force would be resorted to,\r\nin case of refusal, at the same time they pointed to their arms, and\r\ndrew their krises. Our gentlemen took this all in good part, and, after\r\ndispensing a few trifling presents among them, began their retreat\r\nwith a convenient speed, without, however, compromising their dignity.\r\n\r\nThe excursion had been profitable in the way of collections, having\r\nyielded a number of specimens of shrubs and trees, both in flower\r\nand fruit; but owing to the drought, the herbaceous plants were, for\r\nthe most part, dried up. Among the latter, however, they saw a large\r\nand fine terrestrial species of Epidendrum, whose stem grew to the\r\nheight of several feet, and when surmounted by its flowers reached\r\ntwelve or fifteen feet high. Many of the salt-marsh plants seen in\r\nthe Fijis, were also observed here. Besides the plants, some shells\r\nand a beautiful cream-colored pigeon were obtained.\r\n\r\nDuring the day we were busily engaged in the survey of the harbor,\r\nand in making astronomical and magnetical observations on the beach,\r\nwhile some of the officers were employed purchasing curiosities,\r\non shore, at the town, and alongside the ship. These consisted of\r\nkrises, spears, shields, and shells; and the Sulus were not slow in\r\ncomprehending the kind of articles we were in search of.\r\n\r\nFew if any of the Sulus can write or read, though many talk\r\nSpanish. Their accounts are all kept by the slaves. Those who can read\r\nand write are, in consequence, highly prized. All the accounts of the\r\nDatu of Soung are kept in Dutch, by a young Malay from Tarnate, who\r\nwrites a good hand, and speaks English, and whom we found exceedingly\r\nuseful to us. He is the slave of the Datu, who employs him for this\r\npurpose only. He told us he was captured in a brig by the pirates of\r\nBasilan, and sold here as a slave, where he is likely to remain for\r\nlife, although he says the Datu has promised to give him his freedom\r\nafter ten years.\r\n\r\nHorses, cows, and buffaloes are the beasts of burden, and a Sulu\r\nmay usually be seen riding either one or the other, armed cap-a-pie,\r\nwith kris, spear, and target, or shield.\r\n\r\nThey use saddles cut out of solid wood, and many ride with their\r\nstirrups so short that they bring the knees very high, and the\r\nriders look more like well-grown monkeys than mounted men. The cows\r\nand buffaloes are guided by a piece of thong, through the cartilage\r\nof the nose. By law, no swine are allowed to be kept on the island,\r\nand if they are bought, they are immediately killed. The Chinese are\r\nobliged to raise and kill their pigs very secretly, when they desire\r\nthat species of food; for, notwithstanding the law and the prejudices\r\nof the inhabitants, the former continue to keep swine.\r\n\r\n[Natives.] The inhabitants of Sulu are a tall, thin, and\r\neffeminate-looking race: I do not recollect to have seen one corpulent\r\nperson among them. Their faces are peculiar for length, particularly\r\nin the lower jaw and chin, with high cheek-bones, sunken, lack-lustre\r\neyes, and narrow foreheads. Their heads are thinly covered with hair,\r\nwhich appears to be kept closely cropped. I was told that they pluck\r\nout their beards, and dye their teeth black with antimony, and some\r\nfile them.\r\n\r\nTheir eyebrows appear to be shaven, forming a very regular and high\r\narch, which they esteem a great beauty.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the common people is very like that of the Chinese,\r\nwith loose and full sleeves, without buttons. The materials of which\r\nit is made are grass-cloths, silks, satins, or white cotton, from\r\nChina. I should judge from the appearance of their persons, that they\r\nought to be termed, so far as ablutions go, a cleanly people. There\r\nis no outward respect or obeisance shown by the slave to his master,\r\nnor is the presence of the Datu, or even of the Sultan himself, held\r\nin any awe. All appear upon an equality, and there does not seem to\r\nbe any controlling power; yet it may be at once perceived that they\r\nare suspicious and jealous of strangers.\r\n\r\nThe Sulus, although they are ready to do any thing for the sake of\r\nplunder, even to the taking of life, yet are not disposed to hoard\r\ntheir ill-gotten wealth, and, with all their faults, cannot be termed\r\navaricious.\r\n\r\nThey have but few qualities to redeem their treachery, cruelty,\r\nand revengeful dispositions; and one of the principal causes of\r\ntheir being so predominant, or even of their existence, is their\r\ninordinate lust for power. When they possess this, it is accompanied\r\nby a haughty, consequential, and ostentatious bravery. No greater\r\naffront can be offered to a Sulu, than to underrate his dignity and\r\nofficial consequence. Such an insult is seldom forgiven, and never\r\nforgotten. From one who has made numerous voyages to these islands, I\r\nhave obtained many of the above facts, and my own observation assures\r\nme that this view of their character is a correct one. I would,\r\nhowever, add another trait, which is common among them, and that is\r\ncowardice, which is obvious, in spite of their boasted prowess and\r\ndaring. This trait of character is universally ascribed to them among\r\nthe Spaniards in the Philippines, who ought to be well acquainted\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the women is not unlike that of the men in\r\nappearance. They wear close jackets of various colors when they go\r\nabroad, and the same loose breeches as the men, but over them they\r\nusually have a large wrapper (sarong), not unlike the pareu of the\r\nPolynesian islanders, which is put round them like a petticoat, or\r\nthrown over the shoulders. Their hair is drawn to the back of the head,\r\nand around the forehead it is shaven in the form of a regular arch,\r\nto correspond with the eyebrows. Those that I saw at the Sultan's\r\nwere like the Malays, and had light complexions, with very black\r\nteeth. The Datu thought them very handsome, and on our return he\r\nasked me if I had seen the Sultan's beauties. The females of Sulu\r\nhave the reputation of ruling their lords, and possess much weight\r\nin the government by the influence they exert over their husbands.\r\n\r\n[Superiority of women.] It may be owing to this that there is little\r\njealousy of their wives, who are said to hold their virtues in no\r\nvery great estimation. In their houses they are but scantily clothed,\r\nthough women of rank have always a large number of rings on their\r\nfingers, some of which are of great value, as well as earrings of\r\nfine gold. They wear no stockings, but have on Chinese slippers, or\r\nSpanish shoes. They are as capable of governing as their husbands,\r\nand in many cases more so, as they associate with the slaves, from\r\nwhom they obtain some knowledge of Christendom, and of the habits\r\nand customs of other nations, which they study to imitate in every way.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which the Sulus employ their time may be exemplified by\r\ngiving that of the Datu; for all, whether free or slave, endeavor to\r\nimitate the higher rank as far as is in their power. The datus seldom\r\nrise before eleven o'clock, unless they have some particular business;\r\nand the Datu Mulu complained of being sleepy in consequence of the\r\nearly hour at which we had disturbed him.\r\n\r\nOn rising, they have chocolate served in gilt glassware, with some\r\nlight biscuit, and sweetmeats imported from China or Manila, of\r\nwhich they informed me they laid in large supplies. They then lounge\r\nabout their houses, transacting a little business, and playing at\r\nvarious games, or, in the trading season, go to the meeting of the\r\nRuma Bechara.\r\n\r\nAt sunset they take their principal meal, consisting of stews of fish,\r\npoultry, beef, eggs, and rice, prepared somewhat after the Chinese\r\nand Spanish modes, mixed up with that of the Malay. Although Moslems,\r\nthey do not forego the use of wine, and some are said to indulge in\r\nit to a great extent. After sunset, when the air has become somewhat\r\ncooled by the refreshing breezes, they sally forth attended by their\r\nretainers to take a walk, or proceed to the bazaars to purchase goods,\r\nor to sell or to barter away their articles of produce. They then pay\r\nvisits to their friends, when they are in the habit of having frequent\r\nconvivial parties, talking over their bargains, smoking cigars,\r\ndrinking wine and liquors, tea, coffee, and chocolate, and indulging\r\nin their favorite pipe of opium. At times they are entertained with\r\nmusic, both vocal and instrumental, by their dependants. Of this art\r\nthey appear to be very fond, and there are many musical instruments\r\namong them. A datu, indeed, would be looked upon as uneducated if he\r\ncould not play on some instrument.\r\n\r\nIt is considered polite that when refreshments are handed they should\r\nbe partaken of. Those offered us by the Datu were such as are usual,\r\nbut every thing was stale. Of fruit they are said to be very fond,\r\nand can afford to indulge themselves in any kinds. With all these\r\narticles to cloy the appetite, only one set meal a day is taken;\r\nthough the poorer classes, fishermen and laborers, partake of two.\r\n\r\n[Government.] The government of the Sulu Archipelago is a kind of\r\noligarchy, and the supreme authority is vested in the Sultan and the\r\nRuma Bechara or trading council. This consists of about twenty chiefs,\r\neither datus, or their next in rank, called orangs, who are governors\r\nof towns or detached provinces. The influence of the individual\r\nchiefs depends chiefly upon the number of their retainers or slaves,\r\nand the force they can bring into their service when they require\r\nit. These are purchased from the pirates, who bring them to Sulu and\r\nits dependencies for sale. The slaves are employed in a variety of\r\nways, as in trading prahus, in the pearl and bêche de met fisheries,\r\nand in the search after the edible birds' nests.\r\n\r\nA few are engaged in agriculture, and those who are at all educated\r\nare employed as clerks. These slaves are not denied the right of\r\nholding property, which they enjoy during their lives, but at their\r\ndeath it reverts to the master. Some of them are quite rich, and\r\nwhat may appear strange, the slaves of Sulu are invariably better\r\noff than the untitled freemen, who are at all times the prey of the\r\nhereditary datus, even of those who hold no official stations. By\r\nall accounts these constitute a large proportion of the population,\r\nand it being treason for any low-born freeman to injure or maltreat\r\na datu, the latter, who are of a haughty, overbearing, and tyrannical\r\ndisposition, seldom keep themselves within bounds in their treatment\r\nof their inferiors. The consequence is, the lower class of freemen\r\nare obliged to put themselves under the protection of some particular\r\ndatu, which guards them from the encroachment of others. The chief\r\nto whom they thus attach themselves, is induced to treat them well,\r\nin order to retain their services, and attach them to his person,\r\nthat he may, in case of need, be enabled to defend himself from\r\ndepredations, and the violence of his neighbors.\r\n\r\nSuch is the absence of legal restraint, that all find it necessary\r\nto go abroad armed, and accompanied by a trusty set of followers,\r\nwho are also armed. This is the case both by day and night, and,\r\naccording to the Datu's account, frequent affrays take place in the\r\nopen streets, which not unfrequently end in bloodshed.\r\n\r\nCaution is never laid aside, the only law that exists being that of\r\nforce; but the weak contrive to balance the power of the strong by\r\nuniting. They have not only contentions and strife among themselves,\r\nbut it was stated at Manila that the mountaineers of Sulu, who are\r\nsaid to be Christians, occasionally make inroads upon them. At Sulu,\r\nhowever, it did not appear that they were under much apprehension of\r\nthese attacks. The only fear I heard expressed was by the Sultan,\r\nin my interview with him; and the cause of this, as I have already\r\nstated, was probably a desire to find an excuse for not affording us\r\nfacilities to go into the interior. Within twenty years, however,\r\nthe reigning sultan has been obliged to retire within his forts,\r\nin the town of Sulu, which I have before adverted to.\r\n\r\nThese people are hostile to the Sulus of the coast and towns, who\r\ntake every opportunity to rob them of their cattle and property,\r\nfor which the mountaineers seek retaliation when they have an\r\nopportunity. From the manner in which the Datu spoke of them,\r\nthey are not much regarded. Through another source I learned that\r\nthe mountaineers were Papuans, and the original inhabitants of the\r\nislands, who pay tribute to the Sultan, and have acknowledged his\r\nauthority, ever since they were converted to Islamism. Before that\r\ntime they were considered extremely ferocious, and whenever it was\r\npracticable they were destroyed. Others speak of an original race\r\nof Dyacks in the interior, but there is one circumstance to satisfy\r\nme that there is no confidence to be placed in this account, namely,\r\nthat the island is not of sufficient extent to accommodate so numerous\r\na population as some ascribe to it.\r\n\r\nThe forts consist of a double row of piles, filled in with coral\r\nblocks. That situated on the east side of the small stream may be\r\nsaid to mount a few guns, but these are altogether inefficient; and\r\nin another, on the west side, which is rather a rude embankment than\r\na fort, there are some twelve or fifteen pieces of large calibre;\r\nbut I doubt very much if they had been fired off for years, and many\r\nof the houses built upon the water would require to be pulled down\r\nbefore these guns could be brought to bear upon any thing on the side\r\nof the bay, supposing them to be in a good condition; a little farther\r\nto the east of the town, I was informed they had a kind of stockade,\r\nbut none of us were permitted to see it.\r\n\r\n[Population.] According to our estimates, and the information we\r\nreceived while at Sulu, the island itself does not contain more than\r\nthirty thousand inhabitants, of which the town of Soung may have six\r\nor seven thousand. The whole group may number about one hundred and\r\nthirty thousand. I am aware, however, that it is difficult to estimate\r\nthe population of a half-civilized people, who invariably exaggerate\r\ntheir own strength; and visitors are likewise prone to do the same\r\nthing. The Chinese comprise about an eighth of the population of the\r\ntown, and are generally of the lower class. They are constantly busy\r\nat their trades, and intent upon making money.\r\n\r\nAt Soung, business seems active, and all, slaves as well as masters,\r\nseem to engage in it. The absence of a strong government leaves all at\r\nliberty to act for themselves, and the Ruma Bechara gives unlimited\r\nfreedom to trade. These circumstances promote the industry of the\r\ncommunity, and even that of the slave, for he too, as before observed,\r\nhas a life interest in what he earns.\r\n\r\nSoung being the residence of the Sultan, as well as the grand depot\r\nfor all piratical goods, is probably more of a mart than any of the\r\nsurrounding towns. In the months of March and April it is visited by\r\nseveral Chinese junks, who remain trading until the beginning of the\r\nmonth of August. If delayed after that time, they can scarcely return\r\nin safety, being unable to contend with the boisterous weather and\r\nhead winds that then prevail in the Chinese seas. These junks are said\r\nto come chiefly from Amoy, where the cottons, etc., best suited for\r\nthe Sulus are made. Their cargoes consist of a variety of articles of\r\nChinese manufacture and produce, such as silk, satin goods, cottons,\r\nred and checked, grass-cloth clothing, handkerchiefs, cutlery, guns,\r\nammunition, opium, lumber, china and glass-ware, rice, sugar, oil,\r\nlard, and butter. In return for this merchandise they obtain camphor,\r\nbirds' nests, rattans, bêche de mer, pearls, and pearl-shells, coco,\r\ntortoise-shell, and wax; but there is no great quantity of these\r\narticles to be obtained, perhaps not more than two or three cargoes\r\nduring the season. The trade requires great knowledge of the articles\r\npurchased, for the Chinese and Sulus are both such adepts in fraud,\r\nthat great caution and circumspection are necessary.\r\n\r\n[Customs dues.] The duties on importation are not fixed, but are\r\nchanged and altered from time to time by the Ruma Bechara. The\r\nfollowing was stated to me as the necessary payments before trade\r\ncould be carried on:\r\n\r\n\r\nA large ship, with Chinese on board, pays       $2,000\r\nA large ship, without Chinese on board, pays     1,800\r\nSmall ships                                      1,500\r\nLarge brig                                       1,000\r\nSmall brig                                         500\r\nSchooners                                       from 150 to 400\r\n\r\n\r\nThis supposes them all to have full cargoes. That a difference should\r\nbe made in a vessel with or without Chinamen, seems singular; but this,\r\nI was told, arose from the circumstance that English vessels take them\r\non board, in order to detect and prevent the impositions of the Sulus.\r\n\r\nVessels intending to trade at Soung should arrive before the Chinese\r\njunks, and remain as long as they stay, or even a few days later. In\r\ntrading with the natives, all operations ought to be carried on for\r\ncash, or if by barter, no delivery should be made until the articles\r\nto be taken in exchange are received. In short, it is necessary to\r\ndeal with them as though they were undoubted rogues, and this pleases\r\nthem much more than to appear unsuspicious. Vessels that trade engage\r\na bazaar, which they hire of the Ruma Bechara, and it is advisable to\r\nsecure the good-will of the leading datus in that council by presents,\r\nand paying them more for their goods than others.\r\n\r\nThere are various other precautions necessary in dealing with\r\nthis people; for they will, if possible, so act as to give rise to\r\ndisputes, in which case an appeal is made to their fellows, who are\r\nsure to decide against the strangers. Those who have been engaged\r\nin this trade, advise that the prices of the goods should be fixed\r\nupon before the Sultan, and the scales of the Datu of Soung employed;\r\nfor although these are quite faulty, the error is compensated by the\r\narticles received being, weighed in the same. This also secures the\r\nDatu's good-will, by the fee (some fifty dollars) which he receives\r\nfor the use of them. Thus it will be perceived that those who desire\r\nto trade with Sulu, must make up their minds to encounter many\r\nimpositions, and to be continually watchful of their own interests.\r\n\r\nEvery possible precaution ought to be taken; and it will be found,\r\nthe treatment will depend upon, or be according to the force or\r\nresolution that is displayed. In justice to this people it must be\r\nstated, there have been times when traders received every kindness and\r\nattention at the island of Sulu, and I heard it even said, that many\r\nvessels had gone there to refit; but during the last thirty or forty\r\nyears, the reigning sultans and their subjects have become hostile\r\nto Europeans, of whom they plunder and destroy as many as they can,\r\nand this they have hitherto been allowed to do with impunity.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have described the trade with Sulu as limited, yet\r\nit is capable of greater extension; and had it not been for the\r\npiratical habits of the people, the evil report of which has been\r\nso widely spread, Sulu would now have been one of the principal\r\nmarts of the East. The most fertile parts of Borneo are subject to\r\nits authority. There all the richest productions of these Eastern\r\nseas grow in immense quantities, but are now left ungarnered in\r\nconsequence of there being no buyers. The cost of their cultivation\r\nwould be exceedingly low, and I am disposed to believe that these\r\narticles could be produced here at a lower cost than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nBesides the trade with China, there is a very considerable one with\r\nManila in small articles, and I found one of our countrymen engaged\r\nin this traffic, under the Spanish flag. To him I am indebted for\r\nmuch information that his opportunities of observation had given him.\r\n\r\nThe materials for the history of Sulu are meagre, and great doubt\r\nseems to exist in some periods of it. That which I have been able to\r\ngather is as follows:\r\n\r\n[History.] The island of Sulu is generally believed to have been\r\noriginally inhabited by Papuans, some of whom, as I have already\r\nstated, are still supposed to inhabit the mountainous part. The first\r\nintercourse had with them was by the Chinese, who went there in search\r\nof pearls. The Orang Dampuwans were the first of the Malays to form\r\nsettlements on the islands; but after building towns, and making other\r\nimprovements, they abandoned the islands, in consequence, it is said,\r\nof the inhabitants being a perfidious race, having previously to\r\ntheir departure destroyed as many of the natives as they could.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the submarine riches of this archipelago reached Banjar\r\nor Borneo, the people of which were induced to resort there, and\r\nfinding it to equal their expectation, they sent a large colony,\r\nand made endeavors to win over the inhabitants, and obtain thereby\r\nthe possession of their rich isle. In order to confirm the alliance,\r\na female of Banjarmassing, of great beauty, was sent, and married to\r\nthe principal chief; and from this alliance the sovereigns of Sulu\r\nclaim their descent. The treaty of marriage made Sulu tributary to\r\nthe Banjarmassing empire.\r\n\r\nAfter the Banjars had thus obtained possession of the archipelago,\r\nthe trade in its products attracted settlers from the surrounding\r\nislands, who soon contrived to displace the aborigines, and drive\r\nthem to the inaccessible mountains for protection.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chinese took possession of the northern parts of Borneo,\r\nunder the Emperor Songtiping, about the year 1375, the daughter of that\r\nprince was married to a celebrated Arabian chief named Sheriff Alli,\r\nwho visited the shores of Borneo in quest of commerce. The descendants\r\nof this marriage extended their conquests not only over the Sulu\r\nArchipelago, but over the whole of the Philippines, and rendered\r\nthe former tributary to Borneo. In three reigns after this event,\r\nthe sultan of Borneo proper married the daughter of a Sulu chief, and\r\nfrom this union came Mirhome Bongsu, who succeeding to the throne while\r\nyet a minor, his uncle acted as regent. Sulu now wished to throw off\r\nthe yoke of Borneo, and through the intrigues of the regent succeeded\r\nin doing so, as well as in retaining possession of the eastern side\r\nof Borneo, from Maludu Bay on the north, to Tulusyan on the south,\r\nwhich has ever since been a part of the Sulu territory.\r\n\r\nThis event took place before Islamism became the prevailing religion;\r\nbut which form of idolatry, the Sulus pretend, is not now known. It\r\nis, however, believed the people on the coasts were Buddhists, while\r\nthose of the interior were Pagans.\r\n\r\nThe first sultan of Sulu was Kamaludin, and during his reign one Sayed\r\nAlli, a merchant, arrived at Sulu from Mecca. He was a sherif, and soon\r\nconverted one-half of the islanders to his own faith. He was elected\r\nsultan on the death of Kamaludin, and reigned seven years, in the\r\ncourse of which he became celebrated throughout the archipelago. Dying\r\nat Sulu, a tomb was erected to him there, and the island came to be\r\nlooked upon by the faithful as the Mecca of the East, and continued\r\nto be resorted to as a pilgrimage until the arrival of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[Tawi Tawi.] Sayed Alli left a son called Batua, who succeeded him. The\r\nlatter had two sons, named Sabudin and Nasarudin, who, on the death\r\nof their father, made war upon each other. Nasarudin, the youngest,\r\nbeing defeated, sought refuge on Tawi Tawi, where he established\r\nhimself, and built a fort for his protection. The difficulties\r\nwere finally compromised, and they agreed to reign together over\r\nSulu. Nasarudin had two sons, called Amir and Bantilan, of whom the\r\nformer was named as successor to the two brothers, and on their deaths\r\nascended the throne. During his reign another sherif arrived from\r\nMecca, who succeeded in converting the remainder of the population to\r\nIslamism. Bantilan and his brother Amir finally quarrelled, and the\r\nlatter was driven from Sulu to seek refuge in the island of Basilan,\r\nwhere he became sultan.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the Spaniards in 1566, a kind of desultory war was\r\nwaged by them upon the various islands, in the hope of conquering\r\nthem and extending their religion. In these wars they succeeded in\r\ngaining temporary possession of a part of Sulu, and destroyed the\r\ntomb of Sayed Alli. The Spaniards always looked upon the conversion\r\nof the Moslems to the true Catholic faith with great interest; but in\r\nthe year 1646, the sultan of Magindanao succeeded in making peace,\r\nby the terms of which the Spaniards withdrew from Sulu, and were to\r\nreceive from the sultan three cargoes of rice annually as a tribute.\r\n\r\nIn 1608, the small-pox made fearful ravages, and most of the\r\ninhabitants fled from the scourge. Among these was the heir apparent,\r\nduring whose absence the throne became vacant, and another was elected\r\nin his stead. This produced contention for a short time, which ended\r\nin the elected maintaining his place.\r\n\r\nThis tribute continued to be paid until the flight of Amir to Basilan,\r\nabout the year 1752, where he entered into a secret correspondence\r\nwith the authorities at Zamboanga, and after two years a vessel was\r\nsent from Manila, which carried him to that capital, where he was\r\ntreated as a prisoner of state.\r\n\r\n[The English treaty.] In June, 1759, an English ship, on board of\r\nwhich was Dalrymple, then in the service of the East India Company,\r\narrived at Sulu on a trading voyage. Dalrymple remained at Sulu\r\nfor three months, engaged in making sales and purchases. The Sultan\r\nBantilan treated him with great kindness, and sought the interest of\r\nDalrymple to obtain the liberation of his brother, who was now held\r\nprisoner by the Spaniards at Manila, by telling him of the distress\r\nof his brother's wife, who had been left behind when Amir quitted the\r\nisland, and had been delivered of twins, after he had been kidnapped\r\nby the Spaniards. Dalrymple entered into a pledge to restore Amir,\r\nand at the same time effected a commercial treaty between the East\r\nIndia Company and the Sulu chiefs. By this it was stipulated that\r\nan annual cargo should be sent to Sulu, and sold at one hundred per\r\ncent. profit, for which a return cargo should be provided for the China\r\nmarket, which should realize an equal profit there, after deducting all\r\nexpenses. The overplus, if any, was to be carried to the credit of the\r\nSulus. This appears to have been the first attempt made by the English\r\nto secure a regular commercial intercourse with this archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1760, a large fleet of Spanish vessels sailed from Manila,\r\nwith about two thousand men, having the Sultan Amir on board, to\r\ncarry on a war against Sulu.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival, they began active operations. They were repelled\r\non all sides, and after seven days' ineffectual attempts, they gave\r\nup their design. They returned to Manila, it is said, with a loss of\r\nhalf their number, and without having done any injury to the Sulus. Not\r\ndiscouraged with this failure, the Spaniards, about two years after,\r\norganized a still larger force, which is estimated by some accounts as\r\nhigh as ten thousand men. Although this failed in its attempts on the\r\nfort at Soung, the Spaniards obtained possession of Tanjong Matonda,\r\none of the small ports on the island, where they erected a church and\r\nfort. Here they established a colony, and appointed a governor. The\r\ninhabitants upon this deserted their habitations in the neighborhood,\r\nand fled to the mountains, which, it is said, excited the mountaineers,\r\na host of whom, with their chief, whose name was Sri Kala, determined\r\nto rush upon the Spaniards, and annihilate them. Having to contend\r\nagainst disciplined troops, it was not an easy task to succeed. But\r\nSri Kala had a follower, named Sigalo, who offered to lead the host\r\nto battle against the Spaniards, and to exterminate them, or die in\r\nthe attempt. The chief accepted his offer, and Sigalo, with a chosen\r\nfew, marched towards the fort, leaving the rest of the mountaineers\r\nin readiness to join them at an appointed signal, and rush into the\r\nfort en masse.\r\n\r\n[Victory over Spaniards.] Sri Kala and Sigalo, in order to lull\r\nthe watchfulness of the Spaniards, took with them a young woman, of\r\nexquisite beauty, named Purmassuri. The lustful Spaniards were thus\r\nthrown off their guard, the signal was given, and the host, rushing\r\nforward, entered the fort, every Spaniard within which was slain. A\r\nfew only, who were on the outside, escaped to the vessels, which set\r\nsail, and after encountering various mishaps, returned to Manila.\r\n\r\nSome time after this the Sultan Bantilan died, and his son Alim-ud-deen\r\nwas proclaimed sultan. Dalrymple did not return until 1762, with a\r\npart of the appointed cargo; but the vessel in which the larger part\r\nhad been shipped, failed to arrive, from not being able to find Sulu,\r\nand went to China. Thence she proceeded to Manila, and afterwards\r\nto Sulu. The captain of the latter vessel gave a new credit to the\r\nSulus, before they had paid for their first cargo; and on the arrival\r\nof Dalrymple the next time, he found that the small-pox had carried\r\noff a large number of the inhabitants, from which circumstance all\r\nhis hopes of profit were frustrated. He then obtained for the use of\r\nthe East India Company, a grant of the island of Balambangan, which\r\nlies off the north end of Borneo, forming one side of the Straits of\r\nBalabac, the western entrance to the Sulu Sea. Here he proposed to\r\nestablish a trading post, and after having visited Madras, he took\r\npossession of this island in 1763.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1762, the English took Manila, where the Sultan Amir\r\nwas found by Dalrymple, who engaged to reinstate him on his throne,\r\nif he would cede to the English the north end of Borneo, as well\r\nas the south end of Palawan. This he readily promised, and he was,\r\nin consequence, carried back to Sulu and reinstated; his nephew,\r\nAlim-ud-deen, readily giving place to him, and confirming the grant\r\nto the East India Company, in which the Ruma Bechara joined.\r\n\r\nAfter various arrangements, the East India Company took possession of\r\nBalambangan, in the year 1773, and formed a settlement there with a\r\nview of making it an emporium of trade for Eastern commodities. Troops\r\nand stores were sent from India, and the population began to increase\r\nby settlers, both Chinese and Malays, who arrived in numbers. In the\r\nyear 1775, the fort, notwithstanding all the treaties and engagements\r\nbetween Dalrymple and the Sultan, was surprised by the Sulus, and many\r\nof the garrison put to death. [Victory over English.] This virtually\r\nput an end to the plans of the English, although another attempt was\r\nmade to re-establish the settlement by Colonel Farquhar, in 1803;\r\nbut it was thought to be too expensive a post, and was accordingly\r\nabandoned in the next year. This act of the Sulus fairly established\r\ntheir character for perfidy, and ever since that transaction they\r\nhave been looked upon as treacherous in the highest degree, and,\r\nwhat is singular, have been allowed to carry on their piracies quite\r\nunmolested. The taking of Balambangan has been generally imputed to the\r\ntreacherous disposition and innate love of plunder among the Sulus,\r\nas well as to their fear that it would destroy the trade of Sulu by\r\ninjuring all that of the archipelago. But there are strong reasons\r\nfor believing that this dark deed owed its origin in part to the\r\ninfluence of the Spaniards and Dutch, who looked with much distrust\r\nupon the growth of the rival establishment. Such was the jealousy\r\nof the Spaniards, that the governor of the Philippines peremptorily\r\nrequired that Balambangan should be evacuated. The Sulus boast of the\r\ndeed, and admit that they received assistance from both Zamboanga and\r\nTernate, the two nearest Spanish and Dutch ports. These nations had\r\ngreat reasons to fear the establishment of a power like that of the\r\nEast India Company, in a spot so favorably situated to secure the\r\ntrade of the surrounding islands, possessing fine harbors, and in\r\nevery way adapted to become a great commercial depot. Had it been\r\nheld by the East India Company but for a few years, it must have\r\nbecome what Singapore is now.\r\n\r\nThe original planner of this settlement is said to have been Lord\r\nPigot; but the merit of carrying it forward was undoubtedly due to\r\nDalrymple, whose enterprising mind saw the advantage of the situation,\r\nand whose energy was capable of carrying the project successfully\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nSince the capture of Balambangan, there has been no event in the\r\nhistory of Sulu that has made any of the reigns of the Sultans\r\nmemorable, although fifteen have since ascended the throne.\r\n\r\nSulu has from all the accounts very much changed in its character\r\nas well as population since the arrival of the Spaniards, and the\r\nestablishment of their authority in the Philippines. Before that\r\nevent, some accounts state that the trade with the Chinese was\r\nof great extent, and that from four to five hundred junks arrived\r\nannually from Cambojia, with which Sulu principally traded. At that\r\ntime the population is said to have equalled in density that of the\r\nthickly-settled parts of China.\r\n\r\nThe government has also undergone a change; for the Sultan, who\r\namong other Malay races is usually despotic, is here a mere cipher,\r\nand the government has become an oligarchy. This change has probably\r\nbeen brought about by the increase of the privileged class of Datus,\r\nall of whom were entitled to a seat in the Ruma Bechara until about\r\nthe year 1810, when the great inconvenience of so large a council\r\nwas felt, and it became impossible to control it without great\r\ndifficulty and trouble on the part of the Sultan. The Ruma Bechara\r\nwas then reduced until it contained but six of the principal Datus,\r\nwho assumed the power of controlling the state. The Ruma Bechara,\r\nhowever, in consequence of the complaints of many powerful Datus,\r\nwas enlarged; but the more powerful, and those who have the largest\r\nnumerical force of slaves, still rule over its deliberations. The whole\r\npower, within the last thirty years, has been usurped by one or two\r\nDatus, who now have monopolized the little foreign trade that comes\r\nto these islands. The Sultan has the right to appoint his successor,\r\nand generally names him while living. In default of this, the choice\r\ndevolves upon the Ruma Bechara, who elect by a majority.\r\n\r\n[Piracies] From a more frequent intercourse with Europeans and the\r\ndiscovery of new routes through these seas, the opportunities of\r\ncommitting depredations have become less frequent, and the fear of\r\ndetection greater. By this latter motive they are more swayed than\r\nby any thing else, and if the Sulus have ever been bold and daring\r\nrobbers on the high seas, they have very much changed.\r\n\r\nMany statements have been made and published relative to the piracies\r\ncommitted in these seas, which in some cases exceed, and in others\r\nfall short, of the reality. Most of the piratical establishments are\r\nunder the rule, or sail under the auspices of the Sultan and Ruma\r\nBechara of Sulu, who are more or less intimately connected with\r\nthem. The share of the booty that belongs to the Sultan and Ruma\r\nBechara is twenty-five per cent. on all captures, whilst the Datus\r\nreceive a high price for the advance they make of guns and powder,\r\nand for the services of their slaves.\r\n\r\nThe following are the piratical establishments of Sulu, obtained\r\nfrom the most authentic sources, published as well as verbal. The\r\nfirst among these is the port of Soung, at which we anchored, in\r\nthe island of Sulu; not so much from the number of men available\r\nhere for this pursuit, as the facility of disposing of the goods. By\r\nthe Spaniards they are denominated Illanun or Lanuns pirates. [273]\r\nThere are other rendezvous on Pulo Toolyan, at Bohol, Tonho, Pilas,\r\nTawi Tawi, Sumlout, Pantutaran, Parodasan, Palawan, and Basilan,\r\nand Tantoli on Celebes. These are the most noted, but there are many\r\nminor places, where half a dozen prahus are fitted out. Those of Sulu,\r\nand those who go under the name of the Lanuns, have prahus of larger\r\nsize, and better fitted. They are from twenty to thirty tons burden,\r\nand are propelled by both sails and oars. They draw but little water,\r\nare fast sailers, and well adapted for navigating through these\r\ndangerous seas. These pirates are supposed to possess in the whole\r\nabout two hundred prahus, which usually are manned with from forty to\r\nfifty pirates; the number therefore engaged in this business, may be\r\nestimated at ten thousand. They are armed with muskets, blunderbusses,\r\nkrises, hatchets, and spears, and at times the vessels have one or two\r\nlarge guns mounted. They infest the Macassar Strait, the Celebes Sea,\r\nand the Sulu Sea. Soung is the only place where they can dispose of\r\ntheir plunder to advantage, and obtain the necessary outfits. It may\r\nbe called the principal resort of these pirates, where well-directed\r\nmeasures would result in effectually suppressing the crime.\r\n\r\nBesides the pirates of Sulu, the commerce of the eastern islands is\r\nvexed with other piratical establishments. In the neighboring seas,\r\nthere are the Malay pirates, who have of late years become exceedingly\r\ntroublesome. Their prahus are of much smaller size than those of Sulu,\r\nbeing from ten to twelve tons burden, but in proportion they are much\r\nbetter manned, and thus are enabled to ply with more efficiency their\r\noars or paddles. These prahus frequent the shores of Malacca Straits,\r\nCape Roumania, the Carimon Isles, and the neighboring straits, and\r\nat times they visit the Rhio Straits. Some of the most noted, I was\r\ninformed, were fitted out from Johore, in the very neighborhood of\r\nthe English authorities at Singapore; they generally have their haunts\r\non the small islands on the coast, from which they make short cruises.\r\n\r\nThey are noted for their arrangements for preventing themselves\r\nfrom receiving injury, in the desperate defences that are sometimes\r\nmade against them. These small prahus have usually swivels mounted,\r\nwhich, although not of great calibre, are capable of throwing a shot\r\nbeyond the range of small-arms. It is said that they seldom attempt\r\nan attack unless the sea is calm, which enables them to approach their\r\nvictims with more assurance of success, on account of the facility with\r\nwhich they are enabled to manage their boats. The frequent calms which\r\noccur in these seas between the land and sea breezes, afford them many\r\nopportunities of putting their villanous plans in operation; and the\r\nmany inlets and islets, with which they are well acquainted, afford\r\nplaces of refuge and ambush, and for concealing their booty. They\r\nare generally found in small flotillas of from six to twenty prahus,\r\nand when they have succeeded in disabling a vessel at long shot, the\r\nsound of the gong is the signal for boarding, which, if successful,\r\nresults in a massacre more or less bloody, according to the obstinacy\r\nof the resistance they have met with.\r\n\r\nIn the winter months, the Malacca Straits are most infested with them;\r\nand during the summer, the neighborhood of Singapore, Point Rumania,\r\nand the channels in the vicinity. In the spring, from February to\r\nMay, they are engaged in procuring their supplies, in fishing, and\r\nrefitting their prahus for the coming year.\r\n\r\n[Suppression of pirates.] I have frequently heard plans proposed\r\nfor the suppression of these pirates, particularly of those in the\r\nneighborhood of the settlements under British rule. The European\r\nauthorities are much to blame for the quiescent manner in which they\r\nhave so long borne these depredations, and many complaints are made\r\nthat Englishmen, on being transplanted to India, lose that feeling of\r\nhorror for deeds of blood, such as are constantly occurring at their\r\nvery doors, which they would experience in England. There are, however,\r\nmany difficulties to overcome before operations against the pirates\r\ncan be effective. The greatest of these is the desire of the English\r\nto secure the good-will of the chiefs of the tribes by whom they are\r\nsurrounded. They thus wink at their piracies on the vessels of other\r\nnations, or take no steps to alleviate the evils of slavery. Indeed\r\nthe language that one hears from many intelligent men who have\r\nlong resided in that part of the world is, that in no country where\r\ncivilization exists does slavery exhibit so debasing a form as in her\r\nIndian possessions. Another difficulty consists in the want of minute\r\nknowledge of the coasts, inlets, and hiding-places of the pirates, and\r\nthis must continue to exist until proper surveys are made. This done,\r\nit would be necessary to employ vessels that could pursue the pirates\r\neverywhere, for which purpose steamers naturally suggest themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat will appear most extraordinary is, that the very princes who\r\nare enjoying the stipend for the purchase of the site whereon the\r\nEnglish authority is established, are believed to be the most active\r\nin equipping the prahus for these piratical expeditions; yet no notice\r\nis taken of them, although it would be so easy to control them by\r\nwithholding payment until they had cleared themselves from suspicion,\r\nor by establishing residents in their chief towns.\r\n\r\n[The Bajows.] Another, and a very different race of natives who\r\nfrequent the Sulu Archipelago, must not be passed by without\r\nnotice. These are the Bajow divers or fishermen, to whom Sulu is\r\nindebted for procuring the submarine treasures with which her seas\r\nare stored. They are also very frequently employed in the bêche de\r\nmer or trepang fisheries among the islands to the south. The Bajows\r\ngenerally look upon Macassar as their principal place of resort. They\r\nwere at one time believed to be derived from Johore, on the Malayan\r\npeninsula; at another, to be Buguese; but they speak the Sulu dialect,\r\nand are certainly derived from some of the neighboring islands. The\r\nname of Bajows, in their tongue, means fishermen. From all accounts,\r\nthey are allowed to pursue their avocations in peace, and are not\r\nunfrequently employed by the piratical datus, and made to labor for\r\nthem. They resort to their fishing-grounds in fleets of between one\r\nand two hundred sail, having their wives and children with them,\r\nand in consequence of the tyranny of the Sulus, endeavor to place\r\nthemselves under the protection of the flag of Holland, by which\r\nnation this useful class of people is encouraged. The Sulu Seas are\r\ncomparatively little frequented by them, as they are unable to dispose\r\nof the produce of their fisheries for want of a market, and fear the\r\nexactions of the Datus. Their prahus are about five tons each. The\r\nBajows at some islands are stationary, but are for the most part\r\nconstantly changing their ground. The Spanish authorities in the\r\nPhilippines encourage them, it is said, to frequent their islands,\r\nas without them they would derive little benefit from the banks in\r\nthe neighboring seas, where quantities of pearl-oysters are known\r\nto exist, which produce pearls of the finest kind. The Bajows are\r\ninoffensive and very industrious, and in faith Mahomedans.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Sulu during our short stay, though warm, was\r\nagreeable. The time of our visit was in the dry season, which lasts\r\nfrom October till April, and alternates with the wet one, from May\r\ntill September. June and July are the windy months, when strong\r\nbreezes blow from the westward. In the latter part of August and\r\nSeptember, strong gales are felt from the south, while in December\r\nand January the winds are found to come from the northward; but light\r\nwinds usually prevail from the southwest during the wet season, and\r\nfrom the opposite quarter, the dry, following closely the order of the\r\nmonsoons in the China seas. As to the temperature, the climate is very\r\nequable, the thermometer seldom rising above 90° or falling below 70°.\r\n\r\nDiseases are few, and those that prevail arise from the manner in\r\nwhich the natives live. They are from that cause an unhealthy-looking\r\nrace. The small-pox has at various times raged with great violence\r\nthroughout the group, and they speak of it with great dread. Few of\r\nthe natives appeared to be marked with it, which may have been owing,\r\nperhaps, to their escaping this disorder for some years. Vaccination\r\nhas not yet been introduced among them, nor have they practiced\r\ninoculation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Soung was once the Mecca of the East, its people\r\nhave but little zeal for the Mahomedan faith. It was thought at once\r\ntime that they had almost forgotten its tenets, in consequence of\r\nthe neglect of all their religious abservances. The precepts which\r\nthey seem to regard most are that of abstaining from swine's flesh,\r\nand that of being circumcised. Although polygamy is not interdicted,\r\nfew even of the datus have more than one wife.\r\n\r\nSoung Road offers good anchorage; and supplies of all kinds may be\r\nhad in abundance. Beef is cheap, and vegetables and fruits at all\r\nseasons plenty.\r\n\r\nOur observations placed the town in latitude 6° 01' N., longitude 120°\r\n55' 51'' E.\r\n\r\nHaving concluded the treaty and other business that had taken me to\r\nSulu, we took our departure for the Straits of Balabac, the western\r\nentrance into this sea, with a fine breeze to the eastward. By\r\nnoon we had reached the group of Pangootaaraang, consisting of five\r\nsmall islands. All of these are low, covered with trees, and without\r\nlagoons. They presented a great contrast to Sulu, which was seen behind\r\nus in the distance. The absence of the swell of the ocean in sailing\r\nthrough this sea is striking, and gives the idea of navigating an\r\nextensive bay, on whose luxuriant islands no surf breaks. There are,\r\nhowever, sources of danger that incite the navigator to watchfulness\r\nand constant anxiety; the hidden shoals and reefs, and the sweep of\r\nthe tide, which leave him no control over his vessel.\r\n\r\n[Cagayan Sulu.] Through the night, which was exceedingly dark, we\r\nsounded every twenty minutes, but found no bottom; and at daylight\r\non the 7th, we made the islands of Cagayan Sulu, in latitude 7° 03'\r\n30'' N., longitude 118° 37' E. The tide or current was passing the\r\nislands to the west-southwest, three quarters of a mile per hour;\r\nwe had soundings of seventy-five fathoms. Cagayan Sulu has a pleasant\r\nappearance from the sea, and may be termed a high island. It is less\r\ncovered with undergrowth and mangrove-bushes than the neighboring\r\nislands, and the reefs are comparatively small. It has fallen off in\r\nimportance; and by comparing former accounts with those I received,\r\nand from its present aspect, it would seem that it has decreased\r\nboth in population and products. Its caves formerly supplied a large\r\nquantity of edible birds' nests; large numbers of cattle were to be\r\nfound upon it; and its cultivation was carried on to some extent. These\r\narticles of commerce are not so much attended to at the present time,\r\nand the bêche de mer and tortoise-shell, formerly brought hither,\r\nare now carried to other places. There is a small anchorage on the\r\nwest side, but we did not visit it. There are no dangers near these\r\nsmall islands that may not be guarded against. Our survey extended\r\nonly to their size and situation, as I deemed it my duty to devote\r\nall the remainder of the time I had to spare to the Balabac Straits.\r\n\r\n[Balabac straits.] After the night set in, we continued sounding\r\nevery ten minutes, and occasionally got bottom in from thirty to\r\nseventy fathoms. At midnight, the water shoaled to twenty fathoms,\r\nwhen I dropped the anchor until daylight. We shortly afterwards had\r\na change of wind, and a heavy squall passed over us.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we had no shoal ground near us, and the bank on which\r\nwe had anchored was found to be of small size; it is probable that\r\nwe had dropped the anchor on the shoalest place. Vessels have nothing\r\nto fear in this respect.\r\n\r\nAt 9:00 a.m. of the 8th, we made the Mangsee Islands ahead of us, and\r\nlikewise Balabac to the north, and Balambagan to the south. Several\r\nsand-banks and extensive reefs were also seen between them. On seeing\r\nthe ground on which we had to operate, of which the published charts\r\ngive no idea whatever, I determined to proceed, and take a central\r\nposition with the ship under the Mangsee Islands; but in order not to\r\nlose time, I hoisted out and dropped two boats, under Lieutenant Perry,\r\nto survey the first sand-bank we came to, which lies a few miles to\r\nthe eastward of these islands, with orders to effect this duty and join\r\nme at the anchorage, or find a shelter under the lee of the islands.\r\n\r\nAt half-past two p.m. we anchored near the reef, in thirty-six fathoms\r\nwater. I thought myself fortunate in getting bottom, as the reefs on\r\nclosing with them seemed to indicate but little appearance of it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was spent in preparing the boats for our\r\noperations. I now felt the want of the tender. Although in the absence\r\nof this vessel, great exposure was necessary to effect this survey,\r\nI found both officers and men cheerful and willing. The parties were\r\norganized,--the first to proceed to the north, towards Balabac Island,\r\nto survey the intermediate shoals and reefs, under Lieutenant Emmons\r\nand Mr. Totten; the second to the south, under Lieutenants Perry and\r\nBudd; and Mr. Hammersly for the survey of the shoals of Balambangan and\r\nBanguey, and their reefs. The examination of the Mangsee Islands, and\r\nthe reefs adjacent, with the astronomical and magnetic observations,\r\netc., devolved on myself and those who remained on board the ship.\r\n\r\nThe weather was watched with anxiety, and turned out disagreeable,\r\nheavy showers and strong winds prevailing; notwithstanding, the\r\nboats were despatched, after being as well protected against it as\r\npossible. We flattered ourselves that these extensive reefs would\r\nproduce a fine harvest of shells; but, although every exertion\r\nwas made in the search, we did not add as many to our collections\r\nas we anticipated. Some land-shells, however, were found that we\r\nlittle expected to meet with, for many of the trees were covered\r\nwith them, and on cutting them down, large quantities were easily\r\nobtained. Mr. Peale shot several birds, among which was a Nicobar\r\npigeon; some interesting plants and corals were also added. On the\r\nisland a large quantity of drift-wood was found, which with that\r\nwhich is growing affords ample supplies of fuel for ships. No fresh\r\nwater is to be had, except by digging, the island being but a few\r\nfeet above high-water mark.\r\n\r\nAlthough the time was somewhat unfavorable, Lieutenant Emmons and\r\nparty executed their orders within the time designated, and met with no\r\nother obstructions than the inclemency of the weather. This was not,\r\nhowever, the case with Lieutenant Perry, who, near a small beach on\r\nthe island of Balambangan, encountered some Sulus, who were disposed\r\nto attack him. The natives, no doubt, were under the impression that\r\nthe boats were from some shipwrecked vessel. They were all well armed,\r\nand apparently prepared to take advantage of the party if possible;\r\nbut, by the prudence and forbearance of this officer, collision was\r\navoided, and his party saved from an attack.\r\n\r\n[Balambangan.] The island of Balambangan was through the\r\ninstrumentality of Mr. Dalrymple, as heretofore stated, obtained\r\nfrom the Sulus for a settlement and place of deposit, by the East\r\nIndia Company, who took possession of it in 1773. Its situation off\r\nthe northern end of Borneo, near the fertile district of that island,\r\nits central position, and its two fine ports, offered great advantages\r\nfor commerce, and for its becoming a great entrepot for the riches\r\nof this archipelago. Troops, and stores of all kinds, were sent\r\nfrom India; numbers of Chinese and Malays were induced to settle;\r\nand Mr. Herbert, one of the council of Bencoolen, was appointed\r\ngovernor. It had been supposed to be a healthy place, as the island\r\nwas elevated, and therefore probably free from malaria; but in 1775\r\nthe native troops from India became much reduced from sickness, and\r\nthe post consequently much weakened. This, with the absence of the\r\ncruisers from the harbor, afforded a favorable opportunity for its\r\ncapture; and the wealth that it was supposed to contain created an\r\ninducement that proved too great for the hordes of marauding pirates\r\nto resist. Choosing their time, they rushed upon the sentries, put\r\nthem to death, took possession of the guns, and turned them against\r\nthe garrison, only a few of whom made their escape on board of a small\r\nvessel. The booty in goods and valuables was said to have been very\r\nlarge, amounting to nearly four hundred thousand pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nAlthough Borneo offers many inducements to commercial enterprise,\r\nthe policy of the Dutch Company has shut themselves out, as well\r\nas others, by interdicting communication. In consequence, except\r\nthrough indirect channels, there has been no information obtained of\r\nthe singular and unknown inhabitants of its interior. This, however,\r\nis not long destined to be the case.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke, an English gentleman of fortune, has, since our passage\r\nthrough these seas, from philanthropic motives, made an agreement\r\nwith the rajah of Sarawack, on the northern and western side of\r\nBorneo, to cede to him the administration of that portion of the\r\nisland. This arrangement it is believed the British government will\r\nconfirm, in which event Sarawack will at once obtain an importance\r\namong the foreign colonies, in the Eastern seas, second only to that\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe principal inducement that has influenced Mr. Brooke in this\r\nundertaking is the interest he feels in the benighted people of the\r\ninterior, who are known under the name of Dyack, and of whom some\r\nextraordinary accounts have been given.\r\n\r\nA few of these, which I have procured from reputable sources, I will\r\nnow relate, in order that it may be seen among what kind of people\r\nthis gentleman has undertaken to introduce the arts of civilization.\r\n\r\n[The Dyacks.] The Dyacks are, by all accounts, a fine race, and\r\nmuch the most numerous of any inhabiting Borneo. They are almost\r\nexclusively confined to the interior, where they enjoy a fine climate,\r\nand all the spontaneous productions of the tropics. They are believed\r\nto be the aborigines of the island. The name of Dyack seems to be\r\nmore particularly applied to those who live in the southern section\r\nof Borneo. To the north they are called Idaan or Tirun, and those so\r\ntermed are best known to the Sulus, or the inhabitants of that part of\r\nthe coast of Borneo over which the Sulus rule. In personal appearance,\r\nthe Dyacks are slender, have higher foreheads than the Malays, and are\r\na finer and much better-looking people. Their hair is long, straight,\r\nand coarse, though it is generally cropped short round the head. The\r\nfemales are spoken of as being fair and handsome, and many of those\r\nwho have been made slaves are to be seen among the Malays.\r\n\r\nIn manners the Dyacks are described as simple and mild, yet they are\r\ncharacterized by some of the most uncommon and revolting customs of\r\nbarbarians. Their government is very simple; the elders in each village\r\nfor the most part rule; but they are said to have chiefs that do not\r\ndiffer from the Malay rajahs. They wear no clothing except the maro,\r\nand many of them are tattooed, with a variety of figures, over their\r\nbody. They live in houses built of wood, that are generally of large\r\nsize, and frequently contain as many as one hundred persons. These\r\nhouses are usually built on piles, divided into compartments, and\r\nhave a kind of veranda in front, which serves as a communication\r\nbetween the several families. The patriarch, or elder, resides in\r\nthe middle. The houses are entered by ladders, and have doors, but\r\nno windows. The villages are protected by a sort of breastwork.\r\n\r\nAlthough this people are to be found throughout all Borneo, and even\r\nwithin a few miles of the coast, yet they do not occupy any part of\r\nits shores, which are held by Malays, or Chinese settlers. There\r\nis no country more likely to interest the world than Borneo. All\r\naccounts speak of vast ruins of temples and palaces, throughout the\r\nwhole extent of its interior, which the ancestors of the present\r\ninhabitants could not have constructed. The great resemblance these\r\nbear to those of China and Cambojia has led to the belief that Borneo\r\nwas formerly peopled by those nations; but all traditions of the origin\r\nof these edifices have been lost; and so little is now known of the\r\nnorthern side of Borneo, that it would be presumption to indulge in any\r\nsurmises of what may have been its state during these dark ages. Even\r\nthe Bugis priests, who are the best-informed persons in the country,\r\nhave no writings or traditions that bear upon the subject; and the\r\nfew scattered legends of Eastern origin, can afford no proof of the\r\noccurrence of the events they commemorate in any particular locality.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the habits of the Dyacks are discrepant. Some give them\r\ncredit for being very industrious, while others again speak of them\r\nas indolent. They are certainly cultivators of the soil, and in order\r\nto obtain the articles they need, will work assiduously. Many of them\r\nare employed in collecting gold-dust, and some in the diamond mines;\r\nand they will at times be found procuring gums, rattans, etc., from\r\ntheir native forests for barter. They are a people of great energy\r\nof character, and perseverance in the attainment of their object,\r\nparticularly when on war-parties, or engaged in hunting.\r\n\r\nTheir food consists of rice, hogs, rats, snakes, monkeys, and many\r\nkinds of vermin, with which this country abounds.\r\n\r\nTheir chief weapon is the parang or heavy knife, somewhat like the\r\nkris. It is manufactured of native iron and steel, with which the\r\ncoast of the country is said to abound. They have a method of working\r\nit which renders it unnecessary for them to look to a foreign supply;\r\nthe only articles of foreign hardware that they are said to desire,\r\nare razors, out of which to make their cockspurs. One thing seems\r\nstrange: although asserted upon good authority, that the iron and\r\nsteel of the coast are thought to be superior by foreigners, they\r\nare not to be compared with that which is found in the interior,\r\nand manufactured by the Dyacks. All the best krises used by the Malay\r\nrajahs and chiefs, are obtained from the interior. Some of these are\r\nexquisitely manufactured, and so hard that, without turning the edge,\r\nthey cut ordinary wrought iron and steel.\r\n\r\nAmong their other weapons is the sumpit, a hollow tube, through\r\nwhich they blow poisoned arrows. The latter are of various kinds,\r\nand those used in war are dipped in the sap of what the natives term\r\nthe \"upo.\" The effect of this poison is almost instantaneous, and\r\ndestroys life in four or five minutes. Those who have seen a wound\r\ngiven accidentally, describe the changes that the poison occasions\r\nas plainly perceptible in its progress. Before using the arrow, its\r\npoisoned point is dipped in lime-juice to quicken it. The range of\r\nthe sumpit is from fifty to sixty yards. Although the arrows are\r\npoisoned, yet it is said they sometimes eat the games they kill\r\nwith them, parboiling it before it is roasted, which is thought to\r\nextract the poison. Firearms, respecting which they have much fear,\r\nhave not yet been introduced among them; indeed, it is said that so\r\neasily are they intimidated by such weapons, that on hearing a report\r\nof a gun they invariably run away. Each individual in a host would\r\nbe impressed with the belief that he was the one that was to be shot.\r\n\r\n[The diwatas.] They address their prayers to the maker of the world,\r\nwhom they call Dewatta, and this is all the religion they have. There\r\nare many animals and birds held by them in high veneration, and they\r\nare close observers of the flight of birds, from which they draw\r\nprognostics. There is in particular a white-headed eagle or kite, upon\r\nwhose flight and cries they put great reliance, and consult them in war\r\nor on any particular expedition. For this purpose they draw numbers\r\nof them together, and feed them by scattering rice about. It is said\r\ntheir priests consult their entrails also on particular occasions,\r\nto endeavor to look into future events.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of their engagements and oaths, they are most\r\nscrupulous. They seem to have some idea of a future life, and that\r\non the road to their elysium they have to pass over a long tree,\r\nwhich requires the assistance of all those they have slain in this\r\nworld. The abode of happy spirits is supposed to be on the top of Kini\r\nBalu, one of their loftiest mountains, and the portals are guarded\r\nby a fiery serpent, who does not suffer any virgin to pass into the\r\ncelestial paradise.\r\n\r\nPolygamy does not exist among them, but they have as concubines slaves,\r\nwho are captured in their wars or rather predatory expeditions. If a\r\nwife proves unfaithful to her husband, he kills several of his slaves,\r\nor inflicts upon her many blows, and a divorce may be effected by\r\nthe husband paying her a certain price, and giving up her clothes and\r\nornaments, after which he is at liberty to marry another. The women,\r\nhowever, exercise an extraordinary influence over the men.\r\n\r\n[Headhunting.] But of all their peculiar traits, there is none more\r\nstrange than the passion they seem to indulge for collecting human\r\nheads. These are necessary accompaniments in many transactions of\r\ntheir lives, particularly in their marriages, and no one can marry\r\nunless he has a certain number of heads; indeed, those who cannot\r\nobtain these are looked upon with disdain by the females. A young man\r\nwishing to wed, and making application to marry her for whom he has\r\nformed an attachment, repairs with the girl's father to the rajah\r\nor chief, who immediately inquires respecting the number of heads\r\nhe has procured, and generally decides that he ought to obtain one\r\nor two more, according to his age, and the number the girl's father\r\nmay have procured, before he can be accepted. He at once takes his\r\ncanoe and some trusty followers, and departs on his bloody errand,\r\nwaylaying the unsuspecting or surprising the defenceless, whose head\r\nhe immediately cuts off, and then makes a hurried retreat. With this\r\nhe repairs to the dwelling of his mistress, or sends intelligence\r\nof his success before him. On his arrival, he is met by a joyous\r\ngroup of females, who receive him with every demonstration of joy,\r\nand gladly accept his ghastly offering.\r\n\r\nVarious barbarous ceremonies now take place, among which the heads\r\nundergo inspection to ascertain if they are fresh; and, in order to\r\nprove this, none of the brain must be removed, nor must they have been\r\nsubmitted to smoke to destroy the smell. After these preliminaries,\r\nthe family honor of the bride is supposed to be satisfied, and she is\r\nnot allowed to refuse to marry. A feast is now made, and the couple\r\nare seated in the midst naked, holding the bloody heads, when handfuls\r\nof rice are thrown over them, with prayers that they may be happy and\r\nfruitful. After this, the bridegroom repairs in state to the house of\r\nthe bride, where he is received at the door by one of her friends,\r\nwho sprinkles him with the blood of a cock, and her with that of a\r\nhen. This completes the affair, and they are man and wife.\r\n\r\n[Cremation.] Funerals are likewise consecrated by similar offerings,\r\nthe corpse remaining in the house until a slave can be procured,\r\nby purchase or otherwise, whom they design to behead at the time the\r\nbody is burnt. This is done in order that the defunct may be attended\r\nby a slave on his way to the other world or realms of bliss. After\r\nbeing burnt, the ashes of the deceased are gathered in an urn, and\r\nthe head of the slave preserved and placed near it.\r\n\r\nIn some parts, a rajah or chief is buried with great pomp in his war\r\nhabiliments, and food and his arms are placed at his side. A mound\r\nis erected over him, which is encircled with a bamboo fence, upon\r\nwhich a number of fresh heads are stuck, all the warriors who have\r\nbeen attached to him bringing them as the most acceptable offering;\r\nand subsequently these horrid offerings are renewed.\r\n\r\nThe Dyacks are found also in the Celebes island, but there, as in\r\nBorneo, they are confined to the interior. I have already mentioned\r\nthat they were supposed to have been the original inhabitants of the\r\nSulu Archipelago. The Sulus speak of the country of the Dyacks as\r\nbeing exceedingly fertile and capable of producing every thing. The\r\nnorth end of Borneo is particularly valuable, as its produce is easily\r\ntransported from the interior, where much of the land is cultivated. I\r\nhave obtained much more information in relation to this people, in\r\na variety of ways, from individuals as well as from the published\r\naccounts, which are to be found at times in the Eastern prints; but\r\nas this digression has already extended to a great length, I trust\r\nthat enough has been said to enable the reader to contrast it with\r\nthe natives who inhabit the islands that dot the vast Pacific Ocean,\r\nand to make him look forward with interest to the developments that\r\nthe philanthropic exertions of Mr. Brooke may bring to light.\r\n\r\nHaving completed our duties here, the boats were hoisted in, after\r\ndespatching one to leave orders for Mr. Knox of the Flying-Fish,\r\nin a bottle tied to a flagstaff.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 12th, we got under way to proceed direct to\r\nSingapore, and passed through the channel between the reef off the\r\nMangsee Islands, and those of Balambangan and Banguey. We found this\r\nchannel clear, and all the dangers well defined.\r\n\r\nAs the principal objects of my visit were to ascertain the disposition\r\nand resources of the Sulus for trade, and to examine the straits\r\nleading into the Sulu seas, in order to facilitate the communication\r\nwith China, by avoiding on the one hand the eastern route, and on\r\nthe other the dangers of the Palawan Passage, it may be as well to\r\ngive the result of the latter inquiry, referring those who may be\r\nmore particularly interested to the Hydrographical Atlas and Memoir.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the Palawan Passage arising from heavy seas\r\nand fresh gales do not exist in the Sulu Sea, nor are the shoals so\r\nnumerous or so dangerous. In the place of storms and rough water,\r\nsmooth seas are found, and for most of the time moderate breezes,\r\nwhich do not subject a vessel to the wear and tear experienced in\r\nbeating up against a monsoon.\r\n\r\nThe Balabac Straits may be easily reached, either from Singapore,\r\nor by beating up along the western shore of Borneo. When the straits\r\nare reached, a vessel by choosing her time may easily pass through\r\nthem by daylight, even by beating when the wind is ahead. Once\r\nthrough, the way is clear, with the exception of a few coral lumps;\r\nthe occasional occurrence of the north wind will enable a vessel to\r\npass directly to the shores of the island of Panay. A fair wind will\r\nordinarily prevail along the island, and, as I have already mentioned,\r\nit may be approached closely. The passage through to the eastward of\r\nMindoro Island may be taken in preference to that on the west side\r\nthrough the Mindoro Strait, and thus all the reefs and shoals will\r\nbe avoided. Thence, the western coast of Luzon will be followed to\r\nthe north, as in the old route.\r\n\r\nI do not think it necessary to point out any particular route through\r\nthe Sulu Sea, as vessels must be guided chiefly as the winds blow,\r\nbut I would generally avoid approaching the Sulu Islands, as the\r\ncurrents are more rapid, and set rather to the southward. Wherever\r\nthere is anchorage, it would be advisable to anchor at night, as much\r\ntime might thus be saved, and a knowledge of the currents or sets\r\nof the tides obtained. Perhaps it would be as well to caution those\r\nwho are venturesome, that it is necessary to keep a good look-out,\r\nand those who are timid, that there does not appear to be much danger\r\nfrom the piratical prahus, unless a vessel gets on shore; in that\r\ncase it will not be long before they will be seen collecting in the\r\nhorizon in large numbers.\r\n\r\n[Advantages of Sulu treaty.] The treaty that I made with the Sultan, if\r\nstrictly enforced on the first infraction, will soon put an end to all\r\nthe dangers to be apprehended from them. To conclude, I am satisfied\r\nthat under ordinary circumstances, to pass through the Sulu Sea will\r\nshorten by several days the passage to Manila or Canton, and be a\r\ngreat saving of expense in the wear and tear of a ship and her canvass.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, we passed near the location of the Viper Shoal, but saw\r\nnothing of it. It is, therefore, marked doubtful on the chart. As\r\nI had but little time to spare, the look-outs were doubled, and we\r\npursued our course throughout the night, sounding as we went every\r\nfifteen minutes; but nothing met our view.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, although we had the northeast monsoon blowing fresh, we\r\nexperienced a current of twenty-two miles setting to the north. This\r\nwas an unexpected result, as the currents are usually supposed\r\nto prevail in the direction of the monsoon. On the 15th. we still\r\nexperienced it, though not over fifteen miles. On the 16th, we found\r\nit setting west, and as we approached the Malayan Peninsula it was\r\nfound to be running southwest.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, we made Pulo Aor and Pulo Pedang, and arriving off the\r\nSingapore Straits, I hove-to, to await daylight. In the morning at\r\ndawn, we found ourselves in close company with a Chinese junk. The\r\n19th, until late in the afternoon, we were in the Singapore Straits,\r\nmaking but slow progress towards this emporium of the East. The number\r\nof native as well as foreign vessels which we passed, proved that we\r\nwere approaching some great mart, and at 5:00 p.m. we dropped our\r\nanchor in Singapore Roads. Here we found the Porpoise, Oregon, and\r\nFlying-Fish, all well: the two former had arrived on January 22nd,\r\nnearly a month before, and the latter three days previously. Before\r\nconcluding this chapter, I shall revert to their proceedings since\r\nour separation off the Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to the brigs have been heretofore given; but it may\r\nnot be amiss to repeat here that the object in detaching them was,\r\nthat they might explore the line of reefs and islands known to exist to\r\nthe northward and westward of the Hawaiian Group, and thence continue\r\ntheir course towards the coast of Japan. Had they effected the latter\r\nobject, it would have given important results in relation to the force\r\nof the currents, and the temperature of the water. It was desirable,\r\nif possible, to ascertain with certainty the existence on the coast of\r\nJapan of a current similar to the Gulf Stream, to which my attention\r\nhad been particularly drawn.\r\n\r\nThe first land they made was on December 1, 1841, and was Necker\r\nIsland. Birds, especially the white tern, had been seen in numbers\r\nprior to its announcement. Necker Island is apparently a mass of\r\nvolcanic rocks, about three hundred feet high, and is destitute of\r\nany kind of vegetation, but covered with guano. It is surrounded by\r\na reef, three miles from which soundings were obtained, in twenty\r\nfathoms water. The furious surf that was beating on all sides of the\r\nisland, precluded all possibility of a landing being made. By the\r\nconnected observations of the vessels it lies in longitude 164° 37'\r\nW., and latitude 23° 44' N.\r\n\r\nThe French-Frigate Shoal was seen on the 3rd; the weather proved bad,\r\nand they were unable to execute the work of examining this reef. The\r\nsea was breaking furiously upon it.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, the Maro Reef was made in latitude 25° 24' 29'' N.,\r\nlongitude 170° 43' 24'' W. Bottom was found at a distance of four\r\nmiles from the reef, with forty-five fathoms of line. On the 8th,\r\nthey passed over the site of Neva Isle, as laid down by Arrowsmith,\r\nbut no indications of land were seen.\r\n\r\n[Arrival at Singapore.] On the 11th, Lieutenant-Commandant Ringgold\r\ndetermined, on account of the condition of the brigs, and the\r\ncontinuance of bad weather, it was impossible to keep their course to\r\nthe northward and westward towards the coast of Japan; he, therefore,\r\nhauled to the southward, which was much to be regretted, and followed\r\nso very nearly in the same track as that pursued by the Vincennes,\r\ntowards the China seas, that nothing new was elicited by them.\r\n\r\nAfter a passage of fifty-six days from the Sandwich Islands, they\r\ndropped their anchors in Singapore on January 19, 1842, all well. Here\r\nthey found the United States ship Constellation, Commodore Kearney, and\r\nthe sloop of war Boston, Captain Long, forming the East India squadron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nManila in 1819 [274]\r\n\r\nBy An American Naval Officer.\r\n\r\n[Coral.] \" * * * The fine bay of Manila, thirty leagues in\r\ncircumference, is situated near the middle of the west side of the\r\nisland, and has good and clear anchorage in all parts of it, excepting\r\non a coral ledge, called the Shoal of St. Nicholas, which is the only\r\nvisible danger in the bay. The dangerous part of it is, however, of\r\nsmall extent, and with proper attention easily avoided; the least\r\nof water found on it at present is eleven feet, but its summit is\r\nconstantly approaching the surface of the sea, as has been ascertained\r\nby surveys made at different periods by orders of government, which\r\ncircumstance seems to indicate the presence of Zoophytes, that compound\r\nof animal and vegetable life, whose incessant and rapid labors, and,\r\nas we are told by naturalists, whose polypus-like powers of receiving\r\nperfect form and vitality into numberless dismembered portions of their\r\nbodies, have long excited much curiosity and admiration. These small,\r\ncompound animals, commence their operations at the bottom of the sea,\r\nand proceed upwards, towards the surface, spreading themselves in\r\nvarious ramifications; the older members of the mass become concrete,\r\npetrify, and form dangerous shoals; the superior portion of these\r\nlittle colonists always being the last produced, in its turn generates\r\nmyriads of others, and so on, ad infinitum, till they reach the surface\r\nof the ocean. These coral reefs and shoals are found in most parts of\r\nthe world, within the tropics; but the waters of the eastern hemisphere\r\nseem to be peculiarly congenial to their production, and, indeed, there\r\nappear to be certain spaces or regions in these seas, which are their\r\nfavorite haunts. Among many others may be mentioned the Mozambique\r\nchannel, and that tract of ocean, from the eastern coast of Africa,\r\nquite across to the coast of Malabar, including the Mahé, Chagas,\r\nMaldive and Laccadive archipelagos; the southeastern part of the China\r\nsea; the Red sea; the eastern part of Java; the coasts of all the Sunda\r\nislands; and various places in the Pacific ocean. These shoals, when\r\nthey begin to emerge from the sea, are frequented by aquatic fowls,\r\nwhose feathers, and other deposits, combined with the fortuitous\r\nlanding of drifts of wood, weeds, and various other substances from\r\nthe adjacent lands, in the course of time form superaqueous banks,\r\nof considerable elevation; and the broken fragments of coral thrown\r\nup by the waves, slowly, but constantly increase their horizontal\r\ndiameter. Coconuts are frequently seen floating upon the sea in these\r\nregions, some of which are no doubt thrown upon the shores of the\r\nnew created lands; from which accidental circumstance this fruit is\r\nthere propagated. Vagrant birds unconsciously deposit the germs of\r\nvarious other productions of the vegetable kingdom, which in due\r\nseason spring up and clothe their surfaces with verdure; and the\r\nnatural accumulation of dead and putrid vegetation serves to assist\r\nin the formation of a rich and productive soil, and to increase the\r\naltitudes of these new creations. As I have been always much amused\r\nand interested by this subject, and had frequent opportunities,\r\nduring many years' experience, to observe and examine these shoals in\r\ntheir various stages of subaqueous progress, and subsequent emersion\r\nI am convinced that not only many considerable islands, but extensive\r\ninsular groups, owe their existence to the above origin.\"\r\n\r\n[The people.]  [275]\"* * * The natives of these islands are generally\r\nwell made, and bear strong marks of activity and muscular vigor;\r\nthey are in general somewhat larger than the Javanese, and bear some\r\naffinity in the features of their faces to the Malays; their noses\r\nare however more prominent, and their cheek bones not so high, nor are\r\ntheir skins so dark. Their hair is of a jet black, made glossy by the\r\nconstant application of coconut oil, as is the custom in all India,\r\nand drawn together and knotted on top, in the manner of the Malays. The\r\nwomen display great taste in the arrangement and decorations of their\r\nhair, which they secure with silver or gold bodkins, the heads of\r\nwhich are frequently composed of precious stones.\"\r\n\r\n[Mixed blood.]  [276]\"* * * A very considerable proportion of the\r\npopulation of Manila is composed of the mestizos; they are the\r\noffspring of the intermarriages of the Spaniards with the native\r\nwomen, and these again forming connexions with the whites, or with\r\nthe native Indians (the latter, however, less frequent), combine\r\nin stamping upon their descendants a great variety of features and\r\nshades of color; a general resemblance is, however, to be traced, and\r\nwaiving color and manners, a mestizo could not easily be mistaken for\r\na native. This class of the inhabitants is held in nearly the same\r\nestimation as the whites. They are very cleanly in their persons,\r\nand neat in their dress, which, among the males, consists generally\r\nof a pair of cotton trousers of various colors, as fancy dictates,\r\nand shoes in the European manner, a frock, or tunic, of striped grass\r\nmanufacture, worn outside the trousers, in the manner of the Asiatic\r\nArmenians (but without the sash, or girdle), the collars of which are\r\ntastefully embroidered, and thrown back on their shoulders; a European\r\nhat completes their costume, which is light, cool and airy, and after\r\na stranger has been a short time accustomed to see what he at first\r\nwould call a perversion of dress, his prejudices subside, and he has\r\nno hesitation in pronouncing it very proper and graceful. They are\r\nremarkably fine limbed, and well built, the females especially, who\r\nare really models of the most complete symmetry; their hair and eyes,\r\nwhich unlike their skins, seldom vary from the original jet black of\r\ntheir native parents, bestow upon them the primary characteristics of\r\nthe brunette. This people, unlike the generality of mixed colors in\r\nthe human race, have been improved by their intermixture, they are more\r\nindustrious and cleanly than the Spaniards, possess more intelligence\r\nand polish than the Indians and are less malicious and revengeful than\r\neither. The men are employed mostly as writers, brokers, agents and\r\noverseers; many of them hold lucrative offices under government, and\r\nthey not unfrequently arrive at wealth and consideration. The women\r\nare also industrious, and capable of great intellectual improvement;\r\nthey have a natural grace and ease in their manner, and make excellent\r\nwives and mothers. This character must not, however, be taken in an\r\nunlimited sense, for we cannot expect this rule to be without its\r\nexceptions, and it is true that some of these females do degenerate,\r\nand copy after the manners of the creoles, or white natives; but\r\nthis is only the case when, by their intercourse with the whites,\r\ntheir Indian blood is merged and lost in the European. That part\r\nof the population in which is blended the blood of the Chinese and\r\nTagalogs is named the Chinese mestizos.\r\n\r\nThe natives are not unapt in acquiring knowledge, neither do they\r\nwant industry, when efforts are made, and inducements displayed\r\nto call their powers into action. They are excellent mechanics and\r\nartisans, and, as horticulturists, their superiority over many of the\r\nAsiatics is acknowledged. They are polite and affable to strangers,\r\nbut irascible, and when excited are very sanguinary; their natural\r\nbias to this revengeful and cruel character, is strengthened and\r\nrendered more intense by the ... doctrines of the Roman catholic\r\nreligion as dictated to them by the designing and interested priests\r\nwho reside among them. The culprit always finds a sanctuary in the\r\nnearest church, till by the payment of some pecuniary mulct, he\r\nsatisfies the demands of the priests, obtains absolution, appeases\r\nthe resentment of the relations of the deceased, and eludes the arm\r\nof justice; he grows hardened by impunity, repeats his offences,\r\nand again escapes as before.\"\r\n\r\n[A Filipino foundry.] \"* * * All the necessary works for a garrisoned\r\ncity are within its walls; extensive magazines were erected in 1686,\r\nbesides which are a hall of arms, or armory, a repository for powder,\r\nwith bomb-proof vaults, and commodious quarters and barracks for the\r\ngarrison. There is also a furnace and foundry here, which, although\r\ntheir operations were suppressed in 1805, is the most ancient in\r\nthe Spanish monarchy; this establishment was founded in 1584, in\r\nthe village of St. Anna, near Manila; to the latter of which places\r\nit was transferred in 1590. The first founder was a Pampango Indian,\r\nnamed Pandapira. When the Spaniards first arrived at Manila, in 1571,\r\nthey found there a large foundry, which was accidentally burnt,\r\nin consequence of the combustibility of the building and effects,\r\nwhich character applies to all the houses of that period.\"\r\n\r\n[Language.]  [277]\"* * * Their colloquial language, like that of the\r\nnatives of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and many other islands in these seas,\r\nis a dialect of the peninsular Malay from whence it is thought they\r\noriginated; and so striking is its similarity among all these islands,\r\nthat the natives of each can, in a greater or less degree, understand\r\nthat of all the others. The characters of their written language\r\ndiffer widely, and great varieties of arrangement exist among them. The\r\nTagalogs write from top to bottom on palm leaves and strips of bamboo;\r\nand many of the Moros or Mahomedans use the Arabic characters.\"\r\n\r\n[Difference of days.]  [278]From the circumstance of the Spaniards\r\narriving in these seas by Cape Horn, and the general route being by\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, a consequent difference in time of one day\r\nis produced in the different reckoning; the Spaniards losing, and\r\nthose who steer eastward gaining, each in the proportion of half a\r\nday in completing the semi-circumference of the globe. Consequently,\r\nthe time at Manila, being regulated by their own reckonings, is one\r\nday later than that of those who arrive there by steering eastward\r\nfrom America or Europe; as for instance, when by the accounts of the\r\nlatter it is Sunday, by theirs it is only Saturday.\r\n\r\n[English in Manila.] In the year 1762, the city of Manila was taken\r\nby the English, where, and at Cavite, immense quantities of naval and\r\nmilitary stores, brass and iron ordnance, and several fine ships, fell\r\ninto their hands. It was, however, soon delivered up to the Spaniards,\r\non a promise of the payment to the English of four millions of\r\ndollars as a ransom, which, however, never has been paid. This breach\r\nof faith and promise has been loudly complained of by the latter,\r\nand as pertinaciously excused by the Spaniards, who complain that\r\nthe British plundered the city, and committed many other excesses,\r\ncontrary to the express conditions of their engagements, by which\r\nthey were virtually rendered nugatory.\r\n\r\n[Galleon trade.] The inhabitants of Manila have long enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of sending two annual ships to Acapulco called Galleons,\r\nNavios, or Register-Ships, with the produce of the Philippines, of\r\nChina, and other parts of Asia; in return for which, they receive\r\nvarious articles of the production of South America; the principal\r\nof which are cochineal, merchandise of different descriptions of\r\nEuropean origin, and silver in Spanish dollars and ingots, which\r\ncompose the principal part of the value of their return cargoes,\r\namounting annually to about three million five hundred thousand\r\nSpanish dollars. A large proportion of this property belongs to the\r\nconvents in Manila, whose great revenues not only enable them to\r\nengage in extensive mercantile operations, but to lend considerable\r\nsums to the merchants on bottomry. For the indulgence in this trade,\r\nthe proprietors pay a large sum of money to the crown.\r\n\r\nThese ships were of the burden of from twelve to fifteen hundred\r\ntons, and were numerously manned and well appointed for defense; but\r\nof late years, since the revolt of the Spanish colonies, which has\r\nrendered the navigation of the intermediate seas dangerous to these\r\nenterprises, the trade has been greatly interrupted, and instead\r\nof risking it in large bodies, private ships of smaller burden have\r\nbeen hired for the purpose of dividing the risk; some of these have\r\nbeen put under foreign colors, though formerly the galleons wore,\r\nby instruction, the royal flag, their officers were commissioned\r\nand uniformed like the officers of the navy, and the ships were\r\nunder the same regulations and discipline. The object, however, of\r\nthe trade in smaller ships has not been obtained; for so great are\r\nthe fears of the owners and agents of their being captured, and so\r\nmany restrictions laid upon the commanders that they lie in port the\r\nprincipal part of the time; so that in September, 1819, the ships of\r\nthe preceding year had not arrived at Manila; neither had any been\r\ndispatched from the latter place for Acapulco during that time. These\r\ninterruptions, and in fact, the virtual suspension of this commerce,\r\nwill undoubtedly, if a liberal and enlightened policy is pursued,\r\nresult greatly to the advantage of these islands and the mother\r\ncountry. Already since the establishment of the cortes, permitting\r\nforeigners to settle permanently at Manila, great improvements have\r\nbeen made in the productions of the island, and important additions\r\nto the revenue. The failure of the annual remittance of dollars from\r\nSouth America to defray the expenses of the colonial government, of\r\nwhich their revenues from the islands were not adequate to meet one\r\nhalf, has been severely felt, and has stimulated them to make some\r\nvery unusual exertions. Foreign commerce has been more countenanced in\r\nconsequence of this state of things, and greater encouragement has been\r\ngiven to the growers and manufacturers of their staple exports; and if\r\nthe affairs of these islands should in future be properly conducted,\r\nthe revenue arising from the impost on the single article of coffee,\r\nwill in a few years be amply sufficient to support the government,\r\nand leave a net income of the revenue arising from the imposts on all\r\nother articles, besides what would accrue from the taxes and numerous\r\nother resources. A free commerce with other nations would create a\r\ncompetition, and a consequent reduction in the price of imports, and\r\ntheir articles of export would increase, in proportion to the demand\r\nfor them. In short, nothing is wanting in these beautiful islands,\r\nbut ability to direct, and energy to execute the most extensive\r\nplans of agriculture and commerce, which the bounties of the soil,\r\nand its excellent climate and situation, would most certainly render\r\ncompletely successful; and, instead of being, as at present it is,\r\na burden to Spain, it would become a source of great wealth to her.\"\r\n\r\n[Spirit of independence.]  [279]\"* * * It is to be hoped that\r\nthe narrow and illiberal policy which has heretofore retarded the\r\nprosperity of these fine islands, will necessarily be superseded\r\nby more expanded views, and enable them to maintain the rank and\r\nimportance to which their intrinsic worth entitles them. The spirit\r\nof independence which has recently diffused its influence through\r\nthe Spanish colonies on the American continent, has also darted its\r\nrays across the Pacific, and beamed with enlivening lustre upon those\r\nremote regions and the sacred flames of liberty which have been kindled\r\nhave in the bosom of that country, though for a period concealed from\r\nthe view of regal parasites and dependents, burned clear and intense;\r\nand the time is perhaps not very remote, when it shall burst forth,\r\nand shed its joyous light upon the remotest and most inconsiderable\r\nislet of this archipelago.\r\n\r\n[Opportunity for a republic.] Perhaps no part of the world offers a\r\nmore eligible site for an independent republic than these islands;\r\ntheir insular posture and distance from any rival power, combined\r\nwith the intrinsic strength of a free representative government,\r\nwould guarantee their safety and glory; their intermediate situation,\r\nbetween Asia and the American continent, their proximity to China,\r\nJapan, Borneo, the Molucca and Sunda Islands, the Malay peninsula,\r\nCochin China, Tonquin, Siam, and the European possessions in the East,\r\nwould insure them an unbounded commerce, consequently great wealth and\r\npower; and their happiness would be secured by religious toleration\r\nand liberal views of civil liberty in the government. It must be\r\nconfessed, however, that the national character of the Spaniards is\r\nnot suitable to produce and enjoy in perfection this most desirable\r\nstate of affairs; it is to be feared that their bigotry would preclude\r\nreligious toleration, their indolence continue the present system of\r\nslavery, so degrading in a particular manner to a republic, their\r\nwant of energy paralyze the operations of enterprising foreigners\r\namong them. No change, however, can be for the worse, and if all\r\nthe advantage, cannot be reaped by them, which the citizens of our\r\nrepublic would secure, it will be better for them to seize and enjoy\r\nsuch as their genius and talents will enable them to.\"\r\n\r\n[Health.]  [280]\" * * * The health of the city and suburbs is\r\nproverbial, and the profession of a physician is, perhaps, of all\r\nothers the least lucrative. A worthy and intelligent Scotch doctor,\r\nwho had come to Manila, while I was there, to exercise his profession,\r\nand who lodged in the same house with me, was greatly annnoyed at\r\nthe want of practice which he experienced there, although he had his\r\nfull share of patronage, and often jocosely declared that the \"dom\r\nclimate\" would starve him; in fact he did not long remain there;\r\nI afterwards met him in the Isle of France, where he was still in\r\npursuit of practice.\"\r\n\r\n[A barbarous execution.]  [281]\" * * * Impelled by a very common and,\r\nperhaps, excusable curiosity, I rode out with some friends one day\r\nto witness the execution of a mestizo soldier for murder. The parade\r\nground of Bagumbayan was the theater of this tragic comedy, for such\r\nit may be trully called, and never did I experience such a revulsion\r\nof feeling as upon this occasion. The place was crowded with people\r\nof all descriptions, and a strong guard of soldiers, three deep,\r\nsurrounded the gallows, forming a circle, the area of which was about\r\ntwo hundred feet in diameter. The hangman was habited in a red jacket\r\nand trousers, with a cap of the same color upon his head. This fellow\r\nhad been formerly condemned to death for parricide, but was pardoned\r\non condition of turning executioner, and becoming close prisoner for\r\nlife, except when the duties of his profession occasionally called him\r\nfrom his dungeon for an hour. Whether his long confinement, and the\r\nignominious estimation in which he was held, combined with despair of\r\npardon for his heinous offense, and a natural ferocity of character,\r\nhad rendered him reckless of \"weal or woe,\" or other impulse directed\r\nhis movements, I know not, but never did I see such a demoniacal visage\r\nas was presented by this miscreant; and when the trembling culprit\r\nwas delivered over to his hand, he pounced eagerly upon his victim,\r\nwhile his countenance was suffused with a grim and ghastly smile,\r\nwhich reminded us of Dante's devils. He immediately ascended the\r\nladder, dragging his prey after him till they had nearly reached the\r\ntop; he then placed the rope around the neck of the malefactor with\r\nmany antic gestures and grimaces highly gratifying and amusing to the\r\nmob. To signify to the poor fellow under his fangs that he wished to\r\nwhisper in his ear, to push him off the ladder, and to jump astride\r\nhis neck with his heels drumming with violence upon his stomach, was\r\nbut the work of an instant. We could then perceive a rope fast to each\r\nleg of the sufferer, which was pulled with violence by people under\r\nthe gallows, and an additional rope, to use a sea term, a preventer,\r\nwas round his neck, and secured to the gallows, to act in case of\r\naccident to the one by which the body was suspended. I had witnessed\r\nmany executions in different parts of the world, but never had such\r\na diabolical scene as this passed before my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nThe Peopling of the Philippines\r\n\r\nBy Dr. Rudolf Virchow\r\n\r\n(Translated by O. T. Mason; in Smithsonian Institution 1899 Report.)\r\n\r\nSince the days when the first European navigators entered the South\r\nSea, the dispute over the source and ethnic affiliations of the\r\ninhabitants of that extended and scattered island world has been\r\nunsettled. The most superficial glance points out a contrariety in\r\nexternal appearances, which leaves little doubt that here peoples of\r\nentirely different blood live near and among one another.\r\n\r\n[\"Negritos and Indios.\"] And this is so apparent that the pathfinder\r\nin this region, Magellan, gave expression to the contrariety in his\r\nnames for tribes and islands. Since dark complexion was observed\r\non individuals in certain tribes and in defined areas, and light\r\ncomplexion on others, here abundantly, there quite exceptional,\r\nwriters applied Old World names to the new phenomena without further\r\nthought. The Philippines set the decisive example in this. Fernando\r\nMagellan first discovered the islands of this great archipelago in\r\n1521, March 16. After his death the Spaniards completed the circle\r\nof his discoveries. At this time the name of Negros was fixed, which\r\neven now is called Islas de los Pintados. For years the Spaniards\r\ncalled the entire archipelago Islas de Poniente; gradually, after the\r\nexpedition of Don Fray Garcia Jofre de Loaisa (1526), the new title\r\nof the Philippines prevailed, through Salazar.\r\n\r\nThe people were divided into two groups, the Little Negros or Negritos\r\nand the Indios. It is quite conceivable that involuntarily the opinion\r\nprevailed that the Negritos had close relationship with the African\r\nblacks, and the Indios with the lighter-complexioned inhabitants of\r\nIndia, or at least of Indonesia.\r\n\r\nHowever, it must be said here that the theory of a truly African\r\norigin of the Negritos has been advanced but seldom, and then in a very\r\nhesitating manner. The idea that with the present configuration of the\r\neastern island world, especially with their great distances apart, a\r\nvariety of mankind that had never manifested any aptitude for maritime\r\nenterprises should have spread themselves over this vast ocean area,\r\nin order to settle down on this island and on that, is so unreasonable\r\nthat it has found scarcely a defender worth naming. More and more the\r\nblacks are coming to be considered the original peoples, the \"Indios\"\r\nto be the intruders. For this there is a quite reasonable ground,\r\nin that on many islands the blacks dwell in the interior, difficult\r\nof access, especially in the dense and unwholesome mountain forests,\r\nwhile the lighter complexioned tribes have settled the coasts. To\r\nthis are added linguistic proofs, which place the lighter races, of\r\nhomogeneous speech, in linguistic relations with the higher races,\r\nespecially the Malays. Dogmatically it has been said that originally\r\nthese islands had been occupied entirely by the primitive black\r\npopulation, but afterwards, through intrusions from the sea, these\r\nblacks were gradually pressed away from the coast and shoved back\r\ninto the interior.\r\n\r\n[Complicated Pacific problem.] The problem, though it appears simple\r\nenough, has become complicated more and more through the progress\r\nof discovery, especially since Cook enlarged our knowledge of the\r\noriental island world. A new and still more pregnant contrast then\r\nthrust itself to the front in the fact that the blacks and the\r\nlighter-colored peoples are each separated into widely differing\r\ngroups. While the former hold especially the immense, almost\r\ncontinental, regions of Australia (New Holland) and New Guinea, and\r\nalso the larger archipelagos, such as New Hebrides, Solomon Islands,\r\nFiji (Viti) Archipelago--that is, the western areas--the north and\r\neast, Micronesia and Polynesia, were occupied by lighter-colored\r\npeoples. So the first division into Melanesia and Polynesia has\r\nin latest times come to be of value, and the dogma once fixed has\r\nremained. For the Polynesians are by many allied to the Malays,\r\nwhile the blacks are put together as a special ethnological race.\r\n\r\nFor practical ethnology this division may suffice. But the scientific\r\nman will seek also for the blacks a genetic explanation. The answer\r\nhas been furnished by one of the greatest ethnologists, Theodor Waitz,\r\nwho, after he had exposed the insufficiency of the accepted formulas,\r\ncame to the conclusion that the differentiation of the blacks from\r\nthe lighter peoples might be an error. He denied that there had been\r\na primitive black race in Micronesia and Polynesia; in his opinion\r\nwe have here to do with a single race. The color of the Polynesians\r\nmay be out and out from natural causes different, \"their entire\r\nphysical appearance indicates the greatest variability.\" Herein the\r\nwhole question of the domain of variation is sprung with imperfect\r\nsatisfaction on the part of those travelers who give their attention\r\nmore to transitions than to types. Among these are not a few who have\r\nreturned from the South Sea with the conviction that all criteria\r\nfor the diagnosis of men and of races are valueless.\r\n\r\nAnalytical anthropology has led to other and often unexpected\r\nresults. It has proved that just that portion of South Sea\r\npopulation which can apparently lay the strongest claim to be\r\nconsidered a homogeneous race must be separated into a collection\r\nof subvarieties. Nothing appears more likely than that the Negritos\r\nof the Philippines are the nearest relatives to the Melanesians, the\r\nAustralians, the Papuans; and yet it has been proved that all these\r\nare separated one from another by well-marked characters. Whether\r\nthese characters place the peoples under the head of varieties,\r\nor whether, indeed, the black tribes of the South Sea, spite of all\r\ndifferences, are to be traced back to one single primitive stock,\r\nthat is a question of prehistory for whose answer the material\r\nis lacking. Were it possible to furnish the proof that the black\r\npopulations of the South Sea were already settled in their present\r\nhomes when land bridges existed between their territory and Africa,\r\nor when the much-sought Lemuria still existed, it would not be worth\r\nthe trouble to hunt for the missing material. In our present knowledge\r\nwe can not fill the gaps, so we must yet hold the blacks of the Orient\r\nto be separate races.\r\n\r\n[Hair as a race index.] The hair furnished the strongest character\r\nfor diagnosis, in which, not alone that of the head is under\r\nconsideration; the hair, therefore, occupies the foreground of\r\ninterest. Its color is of the least importance, since all peoples of\r\nthe South Sea have black hair. It is more the structure and appearance\r\nwhich furnish the observer convenient starting points for the primary\r\nclassification. Generally a two-fold division satisfies. The blacks,\r\nit is said, have crisped hair, the Polynesians and light-colored\r\npeoples have smooth hair. But this declaration is erroneous in its\r\ngenerality. It is in no way easy to declare absolutely what hair is\r\nto be called crisp, and it is still more difficult to define in what\r\nrespects the so-called crisp varieties differ one from another. For\r\na long time the Australian hair was denominated crisp, until it was\r\nevident that it could be classed neither with that of the Africans\r\nnor with that of the Philippine blacks. Semper, one of the first\r\ntravelers to furnish a somewhat complete description of the physical\r\ncharacters of the Negritos, describes it as an \"extremely thick,\r\nbrown-black, lack-luster, and crisp-woolly crown of hair.\" Among\r\nthese peculiarities the lack-luster is unimportant, since it is due\r\nto want of care and uncleanliness. On the contrary, the other data\r\nfurnish true characters of the hair and among them the crisp-woolly\r\npeculiarity is most valuable.\r\n\r\nOn the terms \"wool\" and \"woolly\" severe controversies, which have not\r\nyet closed, have taken place among ethnologists during the last ten\r\nyears. Also the lack of care, especially the absence of the comb,\r\nhas here acted as a disturbing cause in the decision. But there is\r\nyet a set of peoples, which were formerly included, that are now\r\nbeing gradually disassociated, especially the Australians and the\r\nVeddahs, whose hair, by means of special care, appears quite wavy\r\nif not entirely sleek and smooth. Generally it is frowzy and matted,\r\nso that its natural form is difficult to recognize. To it is wanting\r\nthe chief peculiarity, which obtrudes itself in the African blacks so\r\ncharacteristically that the compact spiral form which it assumes from\r\nits root, the so-called \"pepper-corn,\" is selected as the preferable\r\nmark of the race. The peculiar nappy head has it origin in the spiral\r\n\"rollchen.\" As to the Asiatic blacks this has been for a long time\r\nknown among the Andamanese; it has lately been noticed upon the Sakai\r\nof Malacca, and it is to be found also among the Negritos of the\r\nPhilippines, as I can show by specimens. Therefore, if we seek ethnic\r\nrelationships for the Negritos of the Philippines, or as they are\r\nnamed, the Aetas (Etas, Itas), such connections obtrude themselves\r\nwith the stocks named, and the more strongly since they all have\r\nbrachycephalic, relatively small (nannocephalic) heads and through\r\ntheir small size attach themselves to the peculiar dwarf tribes.\r\n\r\nI might here comment on the singular fact that the Andaman Islands\r\nare situated near the Nicobars in the Indian Ocean, but that the\r\npopulations on both sides of them are entirely different. In my\r\nown detailed descriptions which treat of the skulls and the hair\r\nspecially, it is affirmed that the typical skull shape of the\r\nNicobarese is dolichocephalic and that \"their hair stands between\r\nthe straight hair of the Mongoloid and the sleek, though slightly\r\ncurved or wavy, hair of the Malayan and Indian peoples;\" their skin\r\ncolor is relatively dark, but only so much so as is peculiar to the\r\ntribes of India. With the little blacks of the Andamans there is not\r\nthe slightest agreement. In this we have one of the best evidences\r\nagainst the theory of Waitz-Gerland that the differences in physical\r\nappearance are to be attributed to variation merely. I will, however,\r\nso as not to be misunderstood, expressly emphasize that I am not\r\nwilling to declare that the two peoples have been at all times so\r\nconstituted; I am now speaking of actual conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the same sense I wish also my remarks concerning the Negritos to\r\nbe taken. Not one fact is in evidence from which we may conclude that\r\na single neighboring people known to us has been Negritized. We are\r\ntherefore justified when we see in the Negritos a truly primitive\r\npeople. As they are now, they were more than three hundred and\r\nfifty years ago when the first European navigators visited these\r\nislands. About older relationships nothing is known. All the graves\r\nfrom which the bones of Negritos now in possession were taken belong\r\nto recent times, and also the oldest descriptions which have been\r\nreceived, so far as phylogeny is concerned, must be characterized\r\nas modern.\r\n\r\n[Negritos a primitive people.] The little change in the mode of life\r\nmade known through these descriptions in connection with the low grade\r\nof culture on which these impoverished tribes live amply testify that\r\nwe have before us here a primitive race.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n(The question whether we have to do with older, independent races\r\nin the Malay Archipelago or with mixtures is everywhere an open\r\none.--Translator.)\r\n\r\nWhoever would picture the present ethnic affiliations of the\r\nlight-colored peoples of the Philippines will soon land in confusion\r\non account of the great number of tribes. One of the ablest observers,\r\nFerd. Blumentritt, mentions, besides the Negritos, the Chinese and\r\nthe whites, not less than 51 such tribes. He classifies them in one\r\ngroup as Malays, according to the plan now customary. The division\r\nrests primarily on a linguistic foundation. But when it is noted that\r\nthe identity of language among all the tribes is not established and\r\namong many not at all proved, it is sufficiently shown that speech is\r\na character of little constancy, and that a language may be imposed\r\nupon a people to the annihilation of their own by those who belong\r\nto a different linguistic stock. The Malay Sea is filled with islands\r\non which tarry the remnants of peoples not Malay.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, especially since the Dutch occupation, these old\r\npopulations have received the special name of Alfuros. But this\r\nambiguous term has been used in such an arbitrary and promiscuous\r\nfashion that latterly it has been well-nigh banished from ethnological\r\nliterature. It is not long ago that the Negritos were so called. But\r\nif the black peoples are eliminated, there remains on many islands at\r\nleast an element to be differentiated from the Malay, chiefly through\r\nthe darker skin color, greater orthocephaly, and more wavy, quite\r\ncrimped hair. I have, for the different islands, furnished proof,\r\nand will here only refer to the assertion that \"a broad belt of\r\nwavy and curly hair has pressed itself in between the Papuan and the\r\nMalay, a belt which in the north seems to terminate with the Veddah,\r\nin the south with the Australian.\" One can not read the accounts\r\nof travelers without the increasing conviction of the existence of\r\nseveral different, if not perhaps related, varieties of peoples thrust\r\non the same island.\r\n\r\n[Theory of Negrito and three Malay invasions.] From this results the\r\nnatural and entirely unprejudiced conclusion, which has repeatedly\r\nbeen stated, that either a primitive people by later intrusions\r\nhas been pressed back into the interior or that in course of time\r\nseveral immigrations have followed one another. At the same time\r\nit is not unreasonable to think that both processes went on at the\r\nsame time, and indeed this conception is strongly brought forward. So\r\nBlumentritt assumes that there is there a primitive black people and\r\nthat three separate Malay invasions have taken place. The oldest,\r\nwhose branches have many traits in accord with the Dayaks of Borneo,\r\nespecially the practice of head-hunting; a second, which also took\r\nplace before the arrival of the Spaniards, to which the Tagals,\r\nBisayas, Bicols, Ilocanos, and other tribes belong; the third,\r\nIslamitic, which emigrated from Borneo and might have been interrupted\r\nby the arrival of the Spaniards, and with which a contemporaneous\r\nimmigration from the Moluccas went on. It must be said, however, that\r\nBlumentritt admits two periods for the first invasion. In the earliest\r\nhe places the immigration of the Igorots, Apayos, Zambales--in short,\r\nall the tribes that dwelt in the interior of the country later and\r\nwere pressed away from the coast, therefore, actually, the mountain\r\ntribes. To the second half he assigns the Tinguianes, Catalanganes,\r\nand Irayas, who are not head-hunters, but Semper says they appear to\r\nhave a mixture of Chinese and Japanese blood.\r\n\r\nAgainst this scheme many things may be said in detail, especially that,\r\naccording to the apparently well-grounded assertions of Mueller-Beeck,\r\nthe going of the Chinese to the Philippines was developed about the\r\nend of the fourteenth century, and chiefly after the Spaniards had\r\ngotten a foothold and were using the Mexican silver in trade. At any\r\nrate, the apprehension of Semper, which rests on somewhat superficial\r\nphysiognomic ground, is not confirmed by searching investigations. So\r\nthe head-hunting of the mountain tribes, so far as it hints at\r\nrelations with Borneo, gives no sure chronological result, since\r\nit might have been contemporaneous in them and could have come here\r\nthrough invasion from other islands.\r\n\r\nThe chief inquiry is this: Whether there took place other and older\r\ninvasions. For this we are not only to draw upon the present tribes,\r\nbut if possible upon the remains of earlier and perhaps now extinct\r\ntribes. This possibility has been brought nearer for the Philippines\r\nthrough certain cave deposits. We have to thank, for the first\r\ninformation, the traveler Jagor, whose exceptional talent as collector\r\nhas placed us in the possession of rich material, especially crania. To\r\nhis excellent report of his journey I have already dedicated a special\r\nchapter, in which I have presented and partially illustrated not\r\nonly the cave crania, but also a series of other skulls. An extended\r\nconference upon them has been held in the Anthropological Society.\r\n\r\nThe old Spanish chroniclers describe accurately the mortuary customs\r\nwhich were in vogue in their time. The dead were laid in coffins\r\nmade from excavated tree trunks and covered with a well-fitting\r\nlid. They were then deposited on some elevated place, or mountain,\r\nor river bank, or seashore. Caves in the mountains were also utilized\r\nfor this purpose. Jagor describes such caves on the island of Samar,\r\nwest of Luzon, whose contents have recently been annihilated.\r\n\r\nThe few crania from there which have been intrusted to me\r\nbear the marks of recent pedigree, as also do the additional\r\nobjects. Unfortunately, Dr. Jagor did not himself visit these\r\ninteresting caves, but he has brought crania thence which are of the\r\nhighest interest, and which I must now mention.\r\n\r\n[Study of a giant skull.] The cave in question lies near Lanang, on\r\nthe east coast of Samar, on the bank of a river, it is said. It is,\r\nas the traveler reports, celebrated in the locality \"on account of its\r\ndepressed gigantic crania, without sutures.\" The singular statement\r\nis made clear by means of a well-preserved example, which I lay\r\nbefore you. The entire cranium, including the face, is covered with\r\na thick layer of sinter, which gives it the appearance of belonging\r\nto the class of skulls with Leontiasis ossea. It is, in fact, of\r\ngood size, but through the incrustation it is increased to gigantic\r\nproportions. It is true, likewise, that it has a much flattened,\r\nbroad and compressed form. The cleaning of another skull has shown\r\nthat artificial deformation has taken place, which obviously was\r\ncompleted before the incrustation was laid on by the mineral water\r\nof the cave. I will here add that on the testimony of travelers no\r\nNegritos were on Samar. The island lies in the neighborhood of the\r\nBisayas. Although no description of the position of the skull is at\r\nhand and of the skeleton to which it apparently belonged, it must be\r\nassumed that the dead man was not laid away in a coffin, but placed\r\non the ground; that, in fact, he belonged to an earlier \"period.\" How\r\nlong ago that was can not be known, unfortunately, since no data are\r\nat hand; however, the bones are in a nearly fossilized condition,\r\nwhich allows the conclusion that they were deposited long ago.\r\n\r\nThe deformation itself furnishes no clue to a chronological\r\nconclusion. In Thévenot is found the statement that, according to\r\nthe account of a priest, probably in the 16th century, the custom\r\nprevails in some of the islands to press the heads of new-born babes\r\nbetween two boards, also to flatten the forehead, \"since they believed\r\nthat this form was a special mark of beauty.\" A similar deformation,\r\nwith more pronounced flattening and backward pressure of the forehead,\r\nis shown on the crania which Jagor produced from a cave at Caramuan in\r\nLuzon. There are modes of flattening which remind one of Peru. When\r\nthey came into our hands it was indeed an immense surprise, since\r\nno knowledge of such deformation in the South Sea was at hand. First\r\nour information led to more thorough investigations; so we are aware\r\nof several examples of it from Indonesia and, indeed, from the South\r\nSea (Mallicolo). However, this deformation furnishes no clue to the\r\nantiquity of the graves.\r\n\r\n(Chinese and Korean pottery are said to have been found with\r\nthe deformed crania. Similar deformations exist in the Celebes,\r\nNew Britain, etc. Head-shaping has been universal, cf. A. B. Meyer,\r\nUeber Kunstliche deformirte Schaedel von Borneo und Mindanao and ueber\r\ndie Verbreitung der Sitte der Kunstlichen Schaedeldeformirung, 1881,\r\n36 pp., 4.°--Translator.)\r\n\r\nI have sawed one of these skulls in two along the sagittal suture. The\r\nillustration gives a good idea of the amount of compression and of the\r\nviolence which this skull endured when quite young. The cranial cavity\r\nis inclined backward and lengthened, and curves out above, while the\r\nocciput is pressed downward and the region of the front fontanelle\r\nis correspondingly lacking. Likewise, a considerable thickness of\r\nthe bone is to be noted, especially of the vertex. The upper jaw is\r\nslightly prognathous and the roof of the mouth unusually arched.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the present study, it is unnecessary to go\r\nfurther into particulars. It might be mentioned that all Lanang\r\nskulls are characterized by their size and the firmness of bone,\r\nso that they depart widely from the characteristics of the other\r\nPhilippine examples known to me. Similar skulls have been received\r\nonly from caves, which exist in one of the little rocky islands east\r\nfrom Luzon. They suggest most Kanaka crania from Hawaii, and Moriori\r\ncrania from Chatham islands, and they raise the question whether\r\nthey do not belong to a migration period long before the time of\r\nthe Malays. I have, on various occasions, mentioned this probable\r\npre-Malayan, or at least proto-Malayan, population which stands in\r\nnearest relation to the settling of Polynesia. Here I will merely\r\nmention that the Polynesian sagas bring the progenitor from the west,\r\nand that the passage between Halmahera (Gilolo) and the Philippines\r\nis pointed out as the course of invasion.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it is quite probable that the skulls from Lanang,\r\nCragaray, and other Philippine Islands are the remains of a very old,\r\nif not autochthonous, prehistoric layer of population. The present\r\nmountain tribes have furnished no close analogies. As to the Igorots,\r\nwhich Blumentritt attributes to the first invasion, I refer to my\r\ndescription given on the ground of chronological investigations;\r\naccording to the account given by Hans Meyer the disposal of the dead\r\nin log coffins and in caves still goes on. Of the skulls themselves,\r\nnone were brachycephalous; on the contrary, they exhibit platyrrhine\r\nand in part decidedly pithecoid noses. On the whole, I came to the\r\nconclusion, as did earlier Quatrefages and Hamy, that [Indications of\r\npre-Malay invasion.] \"they stand next in comparison with the Dayaks\r\nof Borneo,\" but I hold yet the impression that they belong to a very\r\nold, probably pre-Malay, immigration.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 18th of March, 1897, I made a communication on the\r\npopulation of the Philippines, a bloody uprising had broken out\r\neverywhere against the existing Spanish rule. In this uprising a\r\ncertain portion of the population, and indeed that which had the\r\nmost valid claim to aboriginality, the so-called Negritos, were not\r\ninvolved. Their isolation, their lack of every sort of political,\r\noften indeed of village organization, also their meager numbers,\r\nrender it conceivable that the greatest changes might go on among\r\ntheir neighbors without their taking such a practical view of them\r\nas to lead to their engaging in them. Thus it can be understood how\r\nthey would take no interest in the further development of the affair.\r\n\r\nSince then the result of the war between Spain and the Americans has\r\nbeen the destruction of Spanish power, and the treaty of Paris brought\r\nthe entire Philippine Archipelago into the possession of the United\r\nStates of America. Henceforth the principal interest is centered\r\nupon the deportment of the insurgents, who have not only outlived\r\nthe great war between the powers, but are now determined to assert,\r\nor win, their independence from the conquerors. These insurgents, who\r\nfor brevity are called Filipinos, belong, as I have remarked, to the\r\nlight-colored race of so-called Indios, who are sharply differentiated\r\nfrom the Negritos. Their ethnological position is difficult to fix,\r\nsince numerous mixtures have taken place with immigrant whites,\r\nespecially with Spaniards, but also with people of yellow and of\r\nbrown races--that is, with Mongols and Chinese. Perhaps here and\r\nthere the importance of this mixture on the composite type of the\r\nIndios has been overestimated; at least in most places positive\r\nproof is not forthcoming that foreign blood has imposed itself upon\r\nthe bright-colored population. Both history and tradition teach, on\r\nthe contrary, as also the study of the physical peculiarities of the\r\npeople that among the various tribes differences exist which suggest\r\nfamily traits. To this effect is the testimony of several travelers\r\nwho have followed one another during a long period of time, as has\r\nbeen developed especially by Blumentritt.\r\n\r\n[All immigrations from the West.] In this connection it must not\r\nbe overlooked that all these immigrations, howsoever many they be\r\nsupposed to have been, must have come this way from the west. Indeed,\r\na noteworthy migration from the east is entirely barred out, if we\r\nlook no farther back than the Chinese and Japanese. On the contrary,\r\nall signs point to the assumption that from of old, long before the\r\ncoming of Portuguese and Spaniards, a strong movement had gone on\r\nfrom this region to the east, and that the great sea way which exists\r\nbetween Mindanao and the Sulu islands on the north and Halmahera\r\nand the Moluccas in the south was the entrance road along which\r\nthose tribes, or at least those navigators whose arrival peopled\r\nthe Polynesian Islands, found their way into the Pacific Ocean. But\r\nalso the movement of the Polynesians points to the west, and if their\r\nancestors may have come from Indonesia there is no doubt that in their\r\nlong journeys eastward they must have touched at the coasts of other\r\nislands on their way, especially the Philippines. Polynesian invasions\r\nof the Philippines are not supposed to have closed when a migration of\r\npeoples or of men passing out to the Pacific Ocean laid the foundation\r\nof a large fraction of the population of the archipelago. It is known\r\nthat now and then single canoes from the Pelew or the Ladrone Islands\r\nwere driven upon the east coast of Luzon, but their importance ought\r\nnot to be overestimated. The migration this way from the west must\r\nhenceforth remain as the point of departure for all explanations of\r\nthis eastern ethnology. (These statements are well enough for working\r\nhypotheses, but actual proofs are not at hand. Ratzel, Berl. Verhandl.,\r\netc., Phil. Hist. Class, 1898, I., p. 33.--Translator.)\r\n\r\nNow, how are the local differences of various tribes to be\r\nexplained, when on the whole the place of origin was the same? Is\r\nthere here a secondary variation of the type, something brought\r\nabout through climate, food, circumstances? It is a large theme,\r\nwhich, unfortunately, is too often dominated by previously-formed\r\ntheories. The importance of \"environment\" and mode of life upon\r\nthe corporeal development of man can not be contested, but the\r\nmeasure of this importance is very much in doubt. Nowhere is this\r\nmeasure, at least in the present consideration, less known than in the\r\nPhilippines. In spite of wide geological and biological differences on\r\nthese islands, there exists a close anthropological agreement of the\r\nIndios in the chief characteristics, and the effort to trace back the\r\ntribal differences that have been marked to climatic and alimentary\r\ncauses has not succeeded. The influence of inherited peculiarities\r\nis also more mighty here, as in most parts of the earth, than that of\r\n\"milieu.\"\r\n\r\nIf we assume, first, that the immigrants brought their peculiarities\r\nwith them, which were fixed already when they came, we must also accept\r\nas self-evident that the Negritos of the Philippines do not belong\r\nto the same stock as the more powerful, bright-colored Indios. As\r\nlong as these islands have been known, more than three centuries,\r\nthe skin of the Negritos has been dark brown, almost black, their\r\nhair short and spirally twisted, and just as long has the skin\r\nof the Indios been brownish, in various shades, relatively clear,\r\nand the hair has been long and arranged in wavy locks. At no time,\r\nso far as known, has it been discovered that among a single family\r\na pronounced variation from these peculiarities had taken place. On\r\nthis point there is entire unanimity. In case of the Negritos there is\r\nnot the least doubt; of the Indios a doubt may arise, for, in fact,\r\nthe shades of skin color appear greatly varied, since the brown is\r\nat times quite blackish, at times yellowish, almost as varied as is\r\nthe color of the sunburnt hair. But even then the practiced eye easily\r\ndetects the descent, and if the skin alone is not sufficient the first\r\nglance at the hair completes the diagnosis. The correct explanation\r\nof individual or tribal variations is difficult only with the Indios,\r\nwhile no such necessity exists in the case of the Negritos. But among\r\nthe Indios these individual and tribal variations are so frequent\r\nand so outspoken that one is justified in making the inquiry whether\r\nthere has not developed here a new type of inherited peculiarities. If\r\nthis were the case, it must still be held that already the immigrant\r\ntribes had possessed them.\r\n\r\n[Assistance from history.] Now, history records that different\r\nimmigrations have actually taken place. Laying aside the latest\r\nbefore the arrival of the Spaniards, that of the Islamites, in\r\nthe fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries, there remains the\r\nolder one. If ethnologists and travelers in general come to the\r\nconclusion concerning Borneo--and it is to be taken as certain--that\r\nthe differences now existing among the wild tribes of this island are\r\nvery old, it ought not be thought so wonderful if, according to the\r\nconditions of the tribes which have immigrated thence, there should\r\nexist on the Philippines near one another dissimilar though related\r\npeoples. This difference is not difficult to recognize in manners and\r\ncustoms--a side of the discussion which is further on to be treated\r\nmore fully. We begin with physical characteristics.\r\n\r\n[Hair differences.] Among these the hair occupies the chief\r\nplace. To be sure, among all the Indios it is black, but it shows\r\nnot the slightest approach to the frizzled condition which is such\r\na prominent feature in the external appearance of the Negritos and\r\nof all the Papuan tribes of the East. This frizzled condition may be\r\ncalled woolly, or in somewhat exaggerated refinement in the name may\r\nbe attributed to the term \"wool,\" all sorts of meanings akin to wool;\r\nin every case there is wanting to all the Indios the crinkling of the\r\nhair from its exit out of the follicle, whereby would result wide\r\nor narrow spiral tubes and the coarse appearance of the so-called\r\n\"peppercorn.\" The hair of all Indios is smooth and straightened out,\r\nand when it forms curves they are only feeble, and they make the\r\nwhole outward appearance wavy or, at most, curled.\r\n\r\nBut within this wavy or curled condition of the hair there are again\r\ndifferences. In my former communication I have attended to examinations\r\nwhich I made upon a large number of islands in the Malay Sea, and in\r\nwhich it was shown that a certain area exists which begins with the\r\nMoluccas and extends to the Sunda group, in which the hair shows a\r\nstrong inclination to form wavy locks, indeed passes gradually into\r\ncrinkled, if not into spiral, rolls. Such hair is found specially\r\nin the interior of the islands, where the so-called aboriginal\r\npopulation is purer and where for a long time the name of Alfuros\r\nhas been conferred on them. On most points affinity with Negritos or\r\nPapuans is not to be recognized. Should such at any time have existed,\r\nwe are a long way from the period when the direct causes therefor are\r\nto be looked for. In this connection the study of the Philippines is\r\nrich with instruction. In the limits of the almost insular, isolated\r\nNegrito enclave, mixtures between Negritos and Indios very seldom\r\nsurprise one, and never the transitions that can have arisen in the\r\npost-generative time of development. (The island of Negros, on the\r\ncontrary, is peopled by such crossbreeds.--Translator.)\r\n\r\nIf there are among the bright-colored islanders of the Indian Ocean\r\nAlfuros and Malays close together there is nothing against coming upon\r\nthis contrast in the Philippine population also. Among the more central\r\npeoples the tribal differences are so great that almost every explorer\r\nstumbles on the question of mixture. There not only the Dayaks and the\r\nother Malays obtrude themselves, but also the Chinese and the Mongolian\r\npeoples of Farther India. Indeed, many facts are known, chiefly\r\nin the language, the religion, the domestic arts, the agriculture,\r\nthe pastoral life which remind one of known conditions peculiarly\r\nIndian. The results of the ethnologists are so tangled here that one\r\nhas to be cautious when one or another of them draws conclusions\r\nconcerning immigrations, because of certain local or territorial\r\nspecializations. Of course, when a Brahmanic custom occurs anywhere\r\nit is right to conclude that it came here from India. But before\r\nassuming that the tribe in which such a custom prevails itself comes\r\nfrom Hither or Farther India, the time has to be ascertained to which\r\nthe custom is to be traced back. The chronological evidence leads to\r\nthe confident belief that the custom and the tribe immigrated together.\r\n\r\n[Ancestor worship.] Over the whole Philippine Archipelago\r\nreligious customs have changed with the progress of external\r\nrelations. Christianity has in many places spread its peculiar customs,\r\nobservances, and opinions, and changed entirely the direction of\r\nthought. On closer view are to be detected in the midst of Christian\r\nactivities older survivals, as ingredients of belief which, in\r\nspite of that religion, have not vanished. Before Christianity, in\r\nmany places, Islam flourished, and it is not surprising to witness,\r\nas on Mindanao, Christian and Mohammedan beliefs side by side. But,\r\nbefore Islam, ancestor worship, as has long been known, was widely\r\nprevalent. In almost every locality, every hut has its Anito with\r\nits special place, its own dwelling; there are Anito pictures and\r\nimages, certain trees and, indeed, certain animals in which some\r\nAnito resides. The ancestor worship is as old as history, for the\r\ndiscoverers of the Philippines found it in full bloom, and rightly\r\nhas Blumentritt characterized Anito worship as the ground form of\r\nPhilippine religion. He has also furnished numerous examples of Anito\r\ncult surviving in Christian communities.\r\n\r\nChronology has a good groundwork and it will have to observe every\r\nfootprint of vanishing creeds. Only, it must not be overlooked that\r\nthe beginning of the chronology of religion has not been reached,\r\nand that the origin of the generally diffused ancestor worship, at\r\nleast on the Philippines, is not known. If it is borne in mind that\r\nbelief in Anitos is widely diffused in Polynesia and in purely Malay\r\nareas, the drawing of certain conclusions therefrom concerning the\r\nprehistory of the Philippines is to be despaired of.\r\n\r\n[Tattooing.] Next to religious customs, among wild tribes fashions\r\nare most enduring. Little of costume is to be seen, indeed, among\r\nthem. Therefore, here tattooing asserts its sway. The more it has\r\nbeen studied in late years the more valuable has been the information\r\nin deciding the kinship relations of tribes. Unfortunately, in the\r\nPhilippines the greater part of the early tattoo designs have been\r\nlost and the art itself is also nearly eliminated. But since the\r\njourney of Carl Semper it has been known that not only Malays but\r\nalso Negritos tattoo; indeed, this admirable explorer has decided\r\nthat the \"Negroes of the East Coast\" practice a different method of\r\ntattooing from that of the Mariveles in the west, and on that account\r\nthey attain different results. In the one case a needle is employed\r\nto make fine holes in the skin in which to introduce the color; in\r\nthe other long gashes are made. In the latter case prominent scars\r\nresult; in the former a smooth pattern. But these combined patterns\r\nare on the whole the same, instead of rectilinear figures. Schadenburg\r\nhas the operations commence with a sharpened bamboo on children 10\r\nyears of age. Among the wild tribes of the light-colored population\r\ntattooing is not less diffused, but the patterns are not alike in the\r\ndifferent tribes. Isabelo de los Reyes reports that the Tinguianes,\r\nwho inhabit the mountain forests of the northern cordilleras of Luzon,\r\nproduce figures of stars, snakes, birds, etc., on children 7 to 9 years\r\nold. Hans Meyer describes the pattern of the Igorots. There appears to\r\nexist a great variety of symbols; for example, on the arms, straight\r\nand crooked lines crossing one another; on the breast, feather-like\r\npatterns. Least frequently he saw the so-called Burik designs, which\r\nextended in parallel bands across the breast, the back, and calves,\r\nand give to the body the appearance of a sailor's striped jacket. It\r\nis very remarkable that the human form never occurs.\r\n\r\nWhat is true concerning tattooing on so many Polynesian islands\r\nholds also completely here. But reliable descriptions are so few,\r\nand especially there is such a meager number of useful drawings,\r\nthat it would not repay the trouble to assemble the scattered data. At\r\nleast it will suffice to discover whether among them there are genuine\r\ntribal marks or to investigate concerning the distribution of separate\r\npatterns. Those known show conclusively that in the matter of tattooing\r\nthe Filipinos are not differentiated from the islanders of the Pacific;\r\nthey form, moreover, an important link in the chain of knowledge\r\nwhich demonstrates the genetic homogeneity of the inhabitants. The\r\ntattooings of the eastern islanders are comparable only to those of\r\nAfrican aborigines, with which last they furnish many family marks,\r\nmade out and recognized. It is desirable that a trustworthy collection\r\nof all patterns be collected before the method becomes more altered\r\nor destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Teeth alterations.] Next to the skin, among the wild tribes the\r\nteeth are modified in the most numerous artificial alterations. The\r\npreferable custom, common in Africa, of breaking out the front\r\nteeth in greater or less number has not, so far as I remember, been\r\ndescribed among the Filipinos; I only mention that while I was making a\r\nrevision of our Philippine crania, two of them turned up in which the\r\nmiddle upper incisors had evidently been broken out for a long time,\r\nfor the alveolar border had shrunk into a small quite smooth ridge,\r\nwithout a trace of an aveolus. It is otherwise with the pointing of\r\nthe incisors, especially the upper ones, which, also is not common. I\r\nmust leave it undecided whether the sharpening is done by filing or by\r\nbreaking off pieces from the sides. The latter should be in general\r\nfar more frequent. In every case the otherwise broad and flat teeth\r\nare brought to such sharp points as to project like those of the\r\ncarnivorous animals. I have met with this condition several times\r\non Negrito skulls and furnished illustrations of them. On a Zambal\r\nskull, excavated by Dr. A. B. Meyer and which I lay before you,\r\nthe deformation is easy to be seen. I called attention at the time\r\nto the fact that among the Malays an entirely different method of\r\nmodifying the teeth is in vogue, in which a horizontal filing on the\r\nfront surface is practiced and the sharp lower edge is straightened\r\nand widened. Already the elder Thévenot has accented this contrast\r\nwhen he says:\r\n\r\n\"These cause the teeth to be equal, those file them to points, giving\r\nthem the shape of a saw.\"\r\n\r\nThis difference appears to have held on till the present; at least\r\nno skull of an Indio is known to me with similar deformation of the\r\nteeth. This custom of the Negritos is so much more remarkable since\r\nthe chipping of the corners of the teeth is widely spread among the\r\nAfrican blacks.\r\n\r\n[Skill flattening.] The other part of the body used most for\r\ndeformation--the skull--is in strong contrast to the last-named\r\ncustom. Deformed crania; especially from older times, are quite\r\nnumerous in the Philippines; probably they belong exclusively to\r\nthe Indios. If they exist among the Negritos, I do not know it; the\r\nonly exception comes from the Tinguianes, of whom I. de los Reyes\r\nreports their skulls are flattened behind (por detrás oprimido). Such\r\nflattening is found, however, not seldom among tribes who have the\r\npractice of binding children on hard cradle boards--chiefly among those\r\nfamilies who keep their infants a long time on such contrivances. A\r\nsure mark by which to discriminate accidental pressure of this sort\r\nfrom one intentionally produced is not at hand; it may be that\r\nin accidental deformation oblique position of the deformed spot\r\nis more frequent; at any rate, the difference in the Philippines\r\nis a very striking one, since there not so much the occiput as the\r\nfront and middle portions suffer from the disfigurements, and thereby\r\ndeformations are produced that have had their most perfect expression\r\namong the ancient Peruvians and other American tribes.\r\n\r\nI have discussed cranial deformation of the Americans in\r\ngreater detail, where I exhibit the accidental and the artificial\r\n(intentional) deformation in their principal forms. The result is that\r\nin large sections of America scarcely any ancient skulls are found\r\nhaving their natural forms, but that the practice of deformation\r\nhas not been general; moreover, a number of deformation centers\r\nmay be differentiated which stand in no direct association with\r\none another. The Peruvian center is far removed from that of the\r\nnorthwest coast, and this again from that of the Gulf States. From\r\nthis it must not be said that each center may have had its own, as\r\nit were, autochthonous origin. But the method has not so spread that\r\nits course can be followed immediately. Rather is the supposition\r\nconfirmed that the method is to be traced to some other time,\r\ntherefore that somewhere there must have been a place of origin for\r\nit. On the Eastern Hemisphere, and especially in the region here\r\nunder consideration, the relations are apparently otherwise. Here\r\nexist, so far as known, great areas entirely free from deformation;\r\nsmall ones, on the other hand, full of it. There are here, also,\r\ndeformation centers, but only a few. Among these, with our present\r\nknowledge, the Philippines occupy the first place.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of this, indeed, is not of long duration. Public\r\nattention was first aroused about thirty years ago concerning\r\nskulls from Samar and Luzon, gathered by F. Jagor from ancient\r\ncaves, to furnish the proof of their deformation. Up to that time\r\nnext to nothing was known of deformed crania in the oriental island\r\nworld. First through my publication the attention of J. G. Riedel,\r\na most observant Dutch resident, was called to the fact that cranial\r\ndeformation is still practiced in the Celebes, and he was so good as to\r\nsend us a specimen of the compressing apparatus for delicate infants\r\n(1874). Compressed crania were also found. But the number was small\r\nand the compression of the separate specimens was only slight. In\r\nboth respects what was observed in the Sunda islands did not differ\r\nfrom the state of the case in the Philippines. Through Jagor's\r\ncollections different places had become known where deformed crania\r\nwere buried. Since then the number of localities has multiplied. I\r\nshall mention only two, on account of their peculiar locality. One is\r\nCagraray, a small island east of Luzon, in the Pacific Ocean, at the\r\nentrance of the Bay of Albay; the other, the island of Marinduque,\r\nin the west, between Luzon and Mindoro. From the last-named island I\r\nsaw, ten years ago, the first picture of one in a photograph album\r\naccidentally placed in my hands. Since then I had opportunity to\r\nexamine the Schadenberg collection of crania, lately come into the\r\npossession of the Reichsmuseum, in Leyden, and to my great delight\r\ndiscovered in it a series of skulls which are compressed in exactly\r\nthe same fashion as those of Lanang. It is said that these will soon\r\nbe described in a publication.\r\n\r\nIt is of especial interest that this method has been noted in the\r\nPhilippines for more than three hundred years. In my first publication\r\nI cited a passage in Thévenot where he says, on the testimony of a\r\npriest, that the natives on some islands had the custom of compressing\r\nthe head of a newborn child between two boards, so that it would be\r\nno longer round, but lengthened out; also they flattened the forehead,\r\nwhich they looked upon as a special mark of beauty. This is, therefore,\r\nan ancient example. It is confirmed by the circumstance that these\r\ncrania are found especially in caves, from the roofs of which mineral\r\nwaters have dripped, which have overlaid the bones partly with a thick\r\nlayer of calcareous matter. The bones themselves have an uncommonly\r\nthick, almost ivory, fossil-like appearance. Only the outer surface\r\nis in places corroded, and on these places saturated with a greenish\r\ninfiltration. It is to be assumed, therefore, that they are very old. I\r\nhave the impression that they must have been placed here before the\r\ndiscovery of the islands and the introduction of Christianity. Their\r\npeculiar appearance, especially their angular form and the thickness\r\nof the bone, reminds one of crania from other parts of the South Sea,\r\nespecially those from Chatham and Sandwich Islands. I shall not here\r\ngo further into this question, but merely mention that I came to the\r\nconclusion that these people must be looked upon as proto-Malayan.\r\n\r\n[Hope of Filipino and American study.] The changes which will take\r\nplace in the political condition of the Philippines may be of little\r\nservice to scientific explorations at first; but the study of the\r\npopulation will be surely taken up with renewed energy. Already\r\nin America scholars have begun to occupy themselves therewith. A\r\nbrief article by Dr. Brinton is to be mentioned as the first sign of\r\nthis. But should the ardent desire of the Filipinos be realized, that\r\ntheir islands *hould have political autonomy, it is to be hoped that,\r\nout of the patriotic enthusiasm of the population and the scientific\r\nspirit of many of their best men, new sources of information will be\r\nopened for the history and the development of oriental peoples. To\r\nthis end it may be here mentioned, by the way, that the connecting\r\nlinks of ancient Philippine history and the customs of these islands,\r\nas well with the Melanesians as with the Polynesians of the south,\r\nare yet to be discovered.\r\n\r\nAs representatives of these two groups, I present, in closing, two\r\nespecially well-formed crania from the Philippines. One of them,\r\nwhich shows the marks of antiquity that I have set forth, belongs\r\nto an \"Indio.\" [Comparison of Indio and Negrito skulls.] It has\r\nthe high cranial capacity of 1,540 cubic centimeters, a horizontal\r\ncircumference of 525 millimeters, and a sagitta-circumference of\r\n386 millimeters; its form is hypsidolicho, quite on the border of\r\nmesocephaly: Index of width, 75.3; index of height, 76.3. Besides,\r\nit has the appearance of a race capable of development; only, the\r\nnose is platyrrhine (index, 52.3), as among so many Malay tribes, and\r\nin the left temple it bears a Processus frontalis squamae temporalis\r\ndeveloped partly from an enlarged fontanelle. The other skull was one\r\ntaken from a Negrito grave of Zambales by Dr. A. B. Meyer. It makes,\r\nat first glance, just as favorable an impression, but its capacity\r\nis only 1,182 cubic centimeters; therefore 358 cubic centimeters less\r\nthan the other. Its form is orthobrachycephalic; breadth index, 80.2;\r\nheight index, 70.6. As in single traits of development, so in the\r\nmeasurements, the difference and the debased character of this race\r\nobtrude themselves. Only, the nasal index is somewhat smaller; on the\r\nwhole, the nose has in its separate parts a decidedly pithecoid form.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nPeople and Prospects of the Philippines\r\n\r\nBlackwood's magazine for August, 1818, has an account of conditions\r\nin Manila and the Philippines from data given by an English merchant\r\nwho left the Islands in 1798 after twenty years' residence in which\r\nhe accumulated a fortune.\r\n\r\n\"Your first question, with respect to the Spanish population, must\r\nrefer to native Spaniards only; as their numerous descendants, through\r\nall the variety of half-castes, would include one third at least of\r\nthe whole population of Luconia (i.e., Luzon--A. C.)\r\n\r\n\"Of native Spaniards, accordingly, settled in the Philippine Islands,\r\nthe total number may be stated at 2,000 not military. The military,\r\nincluding all descriptions, men and officers, are about 2,500,\r\nout of which number the native regiments are officered These last,\r\nin 1796-7, were almost entirely composed of South Americans and were\r\nreckoned at 5,000 men, making a military force of about 7,500.\r\n\r\n\"The castes bearing a mixture of the Spanish blood are in Luconia\r\nalone at least 200,000. The Sangleys, or Chinese descendants, are\r\nupwards of 20,000, and Indians, who call themselves the original\r\nTagalas, about 340,000, making a total population in that island of\r\nabout 600,000 souls. What may be the respective numbers in the other\r\nPhilippine Islands I never had any opportunity of learning.\"\r\n\r\n(This opinion, of a day when it was not desired to disparage the\r\npeople, gives an idea of the mixed blood of the Filipinos which, in the\r\nopinion of the ethnologists, like Ratzel, is a source of strength. It\r\nclasses them with the English and Americans. One danger of the present\r\nappears in over-emphasizing the Malay blood, just as in Spanish times\r\na real loss seems to have come from the contempt toward the Chinese\r\nwhich led to minimizing and concealing a most creditable ancestry.\r\n\r\nPrejudice in the past called all trouble makers mestizos, but today's\r\nstudy is showing that trouble maker meant man who would stand up for\r\nhis rights; one must not forget that mestizo was used as a reproach,\r\nthat the leaders of the people were really typical of the people. By\r\nthe old injustice those who were mediocre were called natives and\r\nwhoever rose above his fellows was claimed as a Spaniard, but a\r\nfairer way would seem to be to consider Filipinos all born in the\r\nPhilippines.--C.).\r\n\r\nThe Cornhill magazine in the late '70s had a contribution by the then\r\nBritish Consul, Mr. Palgreave, on \"Malay Life in the Philippines,\"\r\nthat makes more understandable the reputation of the islands, which\r\nbefore the opening of the Suez were a health resort for Japan,\r\nthe China coast and India. It also shows a fairness to the people\r\nuncommon in the Spanish-inspired writings of his day.\r\n\r\n\"Dull indeed must be his soul, unsympathetic his nature who can see\r\nthe forests and mountains of Luzon, Queen of the Eastern Isles, fade\r\naway into dim violet outlines on the fast receding horizon without\r\nsome pang of longing regret. Not the Aegean, not the West Indian,\r\nnot the Samoan, not any rival in manifold beauties of earth, sea and\r\nsky the Philippine Archipelago. Pity that for the Philippines no word\r\nlimner of note exists. The chiefest, the almost exceptional spell of\r\nthe Philippines, is situated, not in the lake or volcano, forest or\r\nplain, but in the races that form the bulk of the island population.\r\n\r\n\"I said 'almost exceptional' because rarely is an intra-tropical\r\npeople a satisfactory one to eye or mind. But this cannot be\r\nsaid of the Philippine Malays who in bodily formation and mental\r\ncharacteristics alike, may fairly claim a place, not among middling\r\nones merely, but among almost the higher names inscribed on the world's\r\nnational scale. A concentrated, never-absent self-respect, an habitual\r\nself-restraint in word and deed, very rarely broken except when extreme\r\nprovocation induces the transitory but fatal frenzy known as 'amok,'\r\nand an inbred courtesy, equally diffused through all classes, high or\r\nlow, unfailing decorum, prudence, caution, quiet cheerfulness, ready\r\nhospitality and a correct, though not inventive taste. His family is\r\na pleasing sight, much subordination and little constraint, unison in\r\ngradation, liberty--not license. Orderly children, respected parents,\r\nwomen subject but not oppressed, men ruling but not despotic, reverence\r\nwith kindness, obedience in affection, these form lovable pictures,\r\nnot by any means rare in the villages of the eastern isles.\" (Here\r\nagain comes the necessity of combatting the popular impression that the\r\nPhilippines is a tropical land peopled by Malays. The modification of\r\nclimate from being an ocean archipelago suggests that these islands are\r\nreally subtropical, while mixture of blood joined with three centuries\r\nof European civilization makes the term Malay misleading.--C.)\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VII\r\n\r\nFilipino Merchants of the Early 1890s\r\n\r\nF. Karuth, F. R. G. S., (President of an English corporation interested\r\nin Philippine mining) about 1894, wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Few outside the comparatively narrow circle who are directly\r\ninterested in the commerce and resources of the Philippine Islands\r\nknow anything about them. The Philippine merchants are a rather\r\nclose community which only in the last decade or so has expanded its\r\ndiameter a little. There are a number of very old established firms\r\namongst them, several of them being British.... Amongst them also\r\nare firms--perhaps as far as wealth and local influence go, the most\r\nimportant firms--whose chiefs are partly at least of native blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] New York noon is Manilla 1:04 next morning.--C.\r\n\r\n[2] Navarrete, IV, 97 Obs. 2a.\r\n\r\n[3] According to Albo's ship journal, he perceived the difference at\r\nthe Cape de Verde Islands on July 9, 1522; \"Y este día fué miercoles,\r\ny este día tienen ellos pot jueves.\" (And this day was Wednesday and\r\nthis day they had as Thursday.)\r\n\r\n[4] In a note on the 18th page of the masterly English (Hakluyt\r\nSociety) translation of Morga, I find the curious statement that\r\na similar rectification was made at the same time at Macao, where\r\nthe Portuguese, who reached it on an easterly course, had made the\r\nmistake of a day the other way.\r\n\r\n[5] Towards the close of the sixteenth century the duty upon the\r\nexports to China amounted to $40,000 and their imports to at least\r\n$1,330,000. In 1810, after more than two centuries of undisturbed\r\nSpanish rule, the latter had sunk to $1,150,000. Since then they have\r\ngradually increased; and in 1861 they reached $2,130,000.\r\n\r\n[6] The Panama canal prevents this.--C.\r\n\r\n[7] Navarrete, IV, 54 Obs. 1a.\r\n\r\n[8] According to Gehler's Phys. Lex. VI, 450, the log was first\r\nmentioned by Purchas in an account of a voyage to the East Indies in\r\n1608. Pigafetta does not cite it in his treatise on navigation; but\r\nin the forty-fifth page of his work it is said: \"Secondo la misura\r\nche facevamo del viaggio colla cadena a poppa, noi percorrevamo 60 a\r\n70 leghe al giorno.\" This was as rapid a rate as that of our (1870)\r\nfastest steamboats--ten knots an hour.\r\n\r\n[9] The European mail reaches Manila through Singapore and\r\nHongkong. Singapore is about equidistant from the other two\r\nplaces. Letters therefore could be received in the Philippines as soon\r\nas in China, if they were sent direct from Singapore. In that case,\r\nhowever, a steamer communication with that port must be established,\r\nand the traffic is not yet sufficiently developed to bear the double\r\nexpense. According to the report of the English Consul (May, 1870),\r\nthere is, besides the Government steamer, a private packet running\r\nbetween Hongkong and Manila. The number of passengers it conveyed\r\nto China amounted, in 1868, to 441 Europeans and 3,048 Chinese;\r\ntotal, 3,489. The numbers carried the other way were 330 Europeans\r\nand 4,664 Chinese; in all, 4,994. The fare is $80 for Europeans and\r\n$20 for Chinamen.\r\n\r\n[10] Zuñiga, Mavers, I, 225.\r\n\r\n[11] Dr. Pedro Pelaez, in temporary charge of the diocese and dying\r\nin the cathedral, was the foremost Filipino victim. Funds raised in\r\nSpain for relief never reached the sufferers, but not till the end\r\nof Spanish rule was it safe to comment on this in the Philippines.--C.\r\n\r\n[12] Zuñiga, XVIII, M. Velarde, p. 139.\r\n\r\n[13] Captain Salmon, Goch., S. 33.\r\n\r\n[14] The opening of this port proved so advantageous that I intended\r\nto have given a few interesting details of its trade in a separate\r\nchapter, chiefly gathered from the verbal and written remarks of the\r\nEnglish Vice-Consul, the late Mr. N. Loney, and from other consular\r\nreports.\r\n\r\n[15] In 1868, 112 foreign vessels, to the aggregate of 74,054 tons,\r\nand Spanish ships to the aggregate of 26,762 tons, entered the\r\nport of Manila. Nearly all the first came in ballast, but left with\r\ncargoes. The latter both came and left in freight. (English Consul's\r\nReport, 1869.)\r\n\r\n[16] In 1868 the total exports amounted to $14,013,108; of this England\r\nalone accounted for $4,857,000, and the whole of the rest of Europe for\r\nonly $102,477. The first amount does not include the tobacco duty paid\r\nto Spain by the colony, $3,169,144. (English Consul's Report, 1869.)\r\n\r\n[17] La Pérouse said that Manila was perhaps the most fortunately\r\nsituated city in the world.\r\n\r\n[18] Sapan or Sibucao, Caesalpinia Sapan. Pernambuco or Brazil\r\nwood, to which the empire of Brazil owes its name, comes from the\r\nCaesalpinia echinat and the Caesalpinia Braziliensis. (The oldest\r\nmaps of America remark of Brazil: \"Its only useful product is Brazil\r\n(wood).\") The sapan of the Philippines is richer in dye stuff than\r\nall other eastern asiatic woods, but it ranks below the Brazilian\r\nsapan. It has, nowadays, lost its reputation, owing to its being\r\noften stupidly cut down too early. It is sent especially to China,\r\nwhere it is used for dyeing or printing in red. The stuff is first\r\nmacerated with alum, and then for a finish dipped in a weak alcoholic\r\nsolution of alkali. The reddish brown tint so frequently met with in\r\nthe clothes of the poorer Chinese is produced from sapan.\r\n\r\n[19] Large quantities of small mussel shells (Cypraea moneta) were\r\nsent at this period to Siam, where they are still used as money.\r\n\r\n[20] Berghaus' Geo. hydrogr. Memoir.\r\n\r\n[21] Manila was first founded in 1571, but as early as 1565, Urdaneta,\r\nLegaspi's pilot, had found the way back through the Pacific Ocean\r\nwhile he was seeking in the higher northern latitudes for a favorable\r\nnorth-west wind. Strictly speaking, however, Urdaneta was not the first\r\nto make use of the return passage, for one of Legaspi's five vessels,\r\nunder the command of Don Alonso de Arellano, which had on board as\r\npilot Lope Martin, a mulatto, separated itself from the fleet after\r\nthey had reached the Islands, and returned to New Spain on a northern\r\ncourse, in order to claim the promised reward for the discovery. Don\r\nAlonso was disappointed, however, by the speedy return of Urdaneta.\r\n\r\n[22] Kottenkamp I., 1594.\r\n\r\n[23] At first the maximum value of the imports only was limited,\r\nand the Manila merchants were not over scrupulous in making false\r\nstatements as to their worth; to put an end to these malpractices a\r\nlimit was placed to the amount of silver exported. According to Mas,\r\nhowever, the silver illegally exported amounted to six or eight times\r\nthe prescribed limit.\r\n\r\n[24] La Pérouse mentions a French firm (Sebis), that, in 1787, had\r\nbeen for many years established in Manila.\r\n\r\n[25] R. Cocks to Thomas Wilson (Calendar of State Papers, India,\r\nNo. 823) .... \"The English will obtain a trade in China, so they\r\nbring not in any padres (as they term them), which the Chinese cannot\r\nabide to hear of, because heretofore they came in such swarms, and\r\nare always begging without shame.\"\r\n\r\n[26] As late as 1857 some old decrees, passed against the establishment\r\nof foreigners, were renewed. A royal ordinance of 1844 prohibits\r\nthe admission of strangers into the interior of the colony under any\r\npretext whatsoever.\r\n\r\n[27] Vide Pinkerton.\r\n\r\n[28] Each packet was 5 × 2 1/2 × 1 1/2 = 18.75 Spanish cubic\r\nfeet.

The interest of the whole was then to be devoted to masses\r\nfor the founders, or to other pious and benevolent purposes. A third\r\nwas generally kept as a reserve fund to cover possible losses. The\r\ngovernment long since appropriated these reserve funds as compulsory\r\nloans, \"but they are still considered as existing.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the trade with Acapulco came to an end, the principals could no\r\nlonger be laid out according to the intentions of the founders, and\r\nthey were lent out at interest in other ways. By a royal ordinance of\r\nNovember 3, 1854, a junta was appointed to administer the property of\r\nthe . The total capital of the five endowments (in reality only four,\r\nfor one of them no longer possessed anything) amounted to nearly\r\na million of dollars. The profits from the loans were distributed\r\naccording to the amounts of the original capital, which, however,\r\nno longer existed in cash, as the government had disposed of them.\r\n\r\n[31] Vide Thevenot.\r\n\r\n[32] According to Morga, between the fourteenth and fifteenth.\r\n\r\n[33] Vide De Guignes, Pinkerton XI, and Anson X.\r\n\r\n[34] Vide Anson.\r\n\r\n[35] Randolph's History of California.\r\n\r\n[36] In Morga's time, the galleons took seventy days to the Ladrone\r\nIslands, from ten to twelve from thence to Cape Espiritu Santo,\r\nand eight more to Manila.\r\n\r\n[37] A very good description of these voyages may be found in the\r\n10th chapter of Anson's work, which also contains a copy of a sea map,\r\ncaptured in the Cavadonga, displaying the proper track of the galleons\r\nto and from Acapulco.\r\n\r\n[38] De Guignes.\r\n\r\n[39] The officer in command of the expedition, to whom the title of\r\ngeneral was given, had always a captain under his orders, and his\r\nshare in the gain of each trip amounted to $40,000. The pilot was\r\ncontent with $20,000. The first lieutenant (master) was entitled to 9\r\nper cent on the sale of the cargo, and pocketed from this and from the\r\nprofits of his own private ventures upwards of $350,000. (Vide Arenas.)\r\n\r\n[40] The value of the cargoes Anson captured amounted to $1,313,000,\r\nbesides 35,682 ounces of fine silver and cochineal. While England\r\nand Spain were at peace, Drake plundered the latter to the extent of\r\nat least one and a half million of dollars. Thomas Candish burnt the\r\nrich cargo of the Santa Anna, as he had no room for it on board his\r\nown vessel.\r\n\r\n[41] For instance, in 1786 the San Andres, which had a cargo on board\r\nvalued at a couple of millions, found no market for it in Acapulco;\r\nthe same thing happened in 1787 to the San Jose, and a second time\r\nin 1789 to the San Andres.\r\n\r\n[42] In 1855 its population consisted of 586 European Spaniards,\r\n1,378 Creoles, 6,323 Malay Filipinos and mestizos, 332 Chinamen,\r\n2 Hamburgers, 1 Portuguese, and 1 Negro.\r\n\r\n[43] The earthquake of 1863 destroyed the old bridge. It is intended,\r\nhowever, to restore it; the supporting pillars are ready, and\r\nthe superincumbent iron structure is shortly expected from Europe\r\n(April, 1872).--The central span, damaged in the high water of 1914,\r\nwas temporarily replaced with a wooden structure and plans have been\r\nprepared for a new bridge, permitting ships to pass and to be used\r\nalso by the railway, nearer the river mouth.--C.\r\n\r\n[44] Roescher's Colonies.\r\n\r\n[45] A brief description of a nipa house, accompanying an illustration,\r\nis here omitted.--C.\r\n\r\n[46] The following figures will give an idea of the contents of\r\nthe newspapers. I do not allude to the Bulletin Official, which is\r\nreserved for official announcements, and contains little else of\r\nany importance. The number lying before me of the Comercio (Nov. 29,\r\n1858), a paper that appears six times a week, consists of four pages,\r\nthe printed portion in each of which is 11 inches by 17; the whole,\r\ntherefore, contains 748 square inches of printed matter. They are\r\ndistributed as follows:--\r\n\r\nTitle, 27 1/2 sq. in.; an essay on the population of Spain, taken\r\nfrom a book, 102 1/2 sq. in.; under the heading \"News from Europe,\"\r\nan article, quoted from the Annals of La Caridad, upon the increase\r\nof charity and Catholic instruction in France, 40 1/2 sq. in.;\r\nPart I, of a treatise on Art and its Origin (a series of truisms),\r\n70 sq. in.; extracts from the official sheet, 20 1/2 sq. in.; a few\r\nancient anecdotes, 59 sq. in. Religious portion (this is divided into\r\ntwo parts--official and unofficial). The first contains the saints\r\nfor the different days of the year, etc., and the announcements of\r\nreligious festivals; the second advertises a forthcoming splendid\r\nprocession, and contains the first half of a sermon preached three\r\nyears before, on the anniversary of the same festival, 99 sq. in.,\r\nbesides an instalment of an old novel, 154, and advertisements, 175\r\nsq. in.; total, 748 sq. in. In the last years, however, the newspapers\r\nsometimes have contained serious essays, but of late these appear\r\nextremely seldom.\r\n\r\n[47] Vide Pigafetta.\r\n\r\n[48] Cock-fighting is not alluded to in the \"Ordinances of good\r\ngovernment,\" collected by Hurtado Corcuera in the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century. In 1779 cock-fights were taxed for the first\r\ntime. In 1781 the government farmed the right of entrance to\r\nthe galleras (derived from gallo, rooster) for the yearly sum of\r\n$14,798. In 1863 the receipts from the galleras figured in the budget\r\nfor $106,000.\r\n\r\nA special decree of 100 clauses was issued in Madrid on the 21st of\r\nMarch, 1861, for the regulation of cock-fights. The 1st clause declares\r\nthat since cock-fights are a source of revenue to the State, they\r\nshall only take place in arenas licensed by the Government. The 6th\r\nrestricts them to Sundays and holidays; the 7th, from the conclusion\r\nof high mass to sunset. The 12th forbids more than $50 to be staked\r\non one contest. The 38th decrees that each cock shall carry but one\r\nweapon, and that on its left spur. By the 52nd the fight is to be\r\nconsidered over when one or both cocks are dead, or when one shows\r\nthe white feather. In the London Daily News of the 30th June, 1869,\r\nI find it reported that five men were sentenced at Leeds to two\r\nmonths' hard labor for setting six cocks to fight one another with\r\niron spurs. From this it appears that this once favorite spectacle\r\nis no longer permitted in England.\r\n\r\n[49] The raw materials of these adventures were supplied by a French\r\nplanter, M. de la Gironiere, but their literary parent is avowedly\r\nAlexander Dumas.\r\n\r\n[50] Botanical gardens do not seem to prosper under Spanish\r\nauspices. Chamisso complains that, in his day, there were no traces\r\nleft of the botanical gardens founded at Cavite by the learned\r\nCuellar. The gardens at Madrid, even, are in a sorry plight; its\r\nhothouses are almost empty. The grounds which were laid out at great\r\nexpense by a wealthy and patriotic Spaniard at Orotava (Teneriffe),\r\na spot whose climate has been of the greatest service to invalids, are\r\nrapidly going to decay. Every year a considerable sum is appropriated\r\nto it in the national budget, but scarcely a fraction of it ever\r\nreaches Orotava. When I was there in 1867, the gardener had received\r\nno salary for twenty-two months, all the workmen were dismissed,\r\nand even the indispensable water supply had been cut off.\r\n\r\n[51] For a proof of this vide the Berlin Ethnographical Museum,\r\nNos. 294-295.\r\n\r\n[52] Bertillon (Acclimatement et Acclimatation, Dict. Encycl. des\r\nScience, Médicales) ascribes the capacity of the Spaniards for\r\nacclimatization in tropical countries to the large admixture of\r\nSyrian and African blood which flows in their veins. The ancient\r\nIberians appear to have reached Spain from Chaldea across Africa;\r\nthe Phoenicians and Carthaginians had flourishing colonies in the\r\npeninsula, and, in later times, the Moors possessed a large portion\r\nof the country for a century, and ruled with great splendor, a state\r\nof things leading to a mixture of race. Thus Spanish blood has three\r\ndistinct times been abundantly crossed with that of Africa. The warm\r\nclimate of the peninsula must also largely contribute to render its\r\ninhabitants fit for life in the tropics. The pure Indo-European race\r\nhas never succeeded in establishing itself on the southern shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean, much less in the arid soil of the tropics.\r\n\r\nIn Martinique, where from eight to nine thousand whites live on the\r\nproceeds of the toil of 125,000 of the colored race, the population\r\nis diminishing instead of increasing. The French creoles seem to\r\nhave lost the power of maintaining themselves, in proportion to the\r\nexisting means of subsistence, and of multiplying. Families which\r\ndo not from time to time fortify themselves with a strain of fresh\r\nEuropean blood, die out in from three to four generations. The same\r\nthing happens in the English, but not in the Spanish Antilles, although\r\nthe climate and the natural surroundings are the same. According to\r\nRamón de la Sagra, the death-rate is smaller among the creoles, and\r\ngreater among the natives, than it is in Spain; the mortality among\r\nthe garrison, however, is considerable. The same writer states that\r\nthe real acclimatization of the Spanish race takes place by selection;\r\nthe unfit die, and the others thrive.\r\n\r\n[53] An unnecessary line is here omitted.--C.\r\n\r\n[54] Depons, speaking of the means employed in America to obtain the\r\nsame end, says, \"I am convinced that it is impossible to engraft the\r\nChristian religion on the Indian mind without mixing up their own\r\ninclinations and customs with those of Christianity; this has been\r\neven carried so far, that at one time theologians raised the question,\r\nwhether it was lawful to eat human flesh? But the most singular part\r\nof the proceeding is, that the question was decided in favor of the\r\nanthropophagi.\"\r\n\r\n[55] As a matter of fact, productive land is always appropriated,\r\nand in many parts of the Islands is difficult and expensive to\r\npurchase. Near Manila, and in Bulacan, land has for many years past\r\ncost over $225 (silver) an acre.\r\n\r\n[56] Ind. Arch. IV; 307.\r\n\r\n[57] In Buitenzorger's garden, Java, the author observed, however,\r\nsome specimens growing in fresh water.\r\n\r\n[58] Boyle, in his Adventures among the Dyaks, mentions that he\r\nactually found pneumatic tinder-boxes, made of bamboo, in use among\r\nthe Dyaks; Bastian met with them in Burmah. Boyle saw a Dyak place\r\nsome tinder on a broken piece of earthenware, holding it steady with\r\nhis thumb while he struck it a sharp blow with a piece of bamboo. The\r\ntinder took fire. Wallace observed the same method of striking a\r\nlight in Ternate.\r\n\r\n[59] Centigrade is changed to Fahrenheit by multiplying by nine-fifths\r\nand adding thirty-two.--C.\r\n\r\n[60] Tylor (Anahuac 227) says that this word is derived from the\r\nMexican petlatl, a mat. The inhabitants of the Philippines call this\r\npetate, and from the Mexican petla-calli, a mat \"house,\" derive petaca,\r\na cigar case.\r\n\r\n[61] Four lines, re an omitted sketch, left out.--C.\r\n\r\n[62] Voyage en Chine, vol. II., page 33.\r\n\r\n[63] According to the report of an engineer, the sand banks are caused\r\nby the river San Mateo, which runs into the Pasig at right angles\r\nshortly after the latter leaves the Lagoon; in the rainy season it\r\nbrings down a quantity of mud, which is heaped up and embanked by the\r\nsouth-west winds that prevail at the time. It would, therefore, be of\r\nlittle use to remove the sandbanks without giving the San Mateo, the\r\ncause of their existence, a direct and separate outlet into the lake.\r\n\r\n[64] They take baths for their maladies, and have hot springs for\r\nthis purpose, particularly along the shore of the king's lake (Estang\r\ndu Roy, instead of Estang de Bay by a printer's mistake apparently),\r\nwhich is in the Island of Manila.--Thevenot.\r\n\r\n[65] \"One can scarcely walk thirty paces between Mount Makiling and\r\na place called Bacon, which lies to the east of Los Baños, without\r\nmeeting several kinds of natural springs, some very hot, some lukewarm,\r\nsome of the temperature of the atmosphere, and some very cold. In a\r\ndescription of this place given in our archives for the year 1739, it\r\nis recorded that a hill called Natognos lies a mile to the south-east\r\nof the village, on the plateau of which there is a small plain 400\r\nfeet square, which is kept in constant motion by the volume of vapor\r\nissuing from it. The soil from which this vapor issues is an extremely\r\nwhite earth; it is sometimes thrown up to the height of a yard or a\r\nyard and a half, and meeting the lower temperature of the atmosphere\r\nfalls to the ground in small pieces.\"--Estado geograph., 1865.\r\n\r\n[66] Pigafetta says that the natives, in order to obtain palm-wine,\r\ncut the top of the tree through to the pith, and then catch the sap\r\nas it oozes out of the incision. According to Regnaud, Natural History\r\nof the Coco-tree, the negroes of Saint Thomas pursue a similar method\r\nin the present day, a method that considerably injures the trees and\r\nproduces a much smaller quantity of liquor. Hernandez describes an\r\nindigenous process of obtaining wine, honey, and sago from the sacsao\r\npalm, a tree which from its stunted growth would seem to correspond\r\nwith the acenga saccharifera. The trees are tapped near the top, the\r\nsoft part of the trunks is hollowed out, and the sap collects in this\r\nempty space. When all the juice is extracted, the tree is allowed to\r\ndry up, and is then cut into thin pieces which, after desiccation in\r\nthe sun, are ground into meal.\r\n\r\n[67] Pigafetta mentions that the natives were in the habit of making\r\noil, vinegar, wine, and milk, from the coco-palm, and that they drank\r\na great deal of the wine. Their kings, he says, frequently intoxicated\r\nthemselves at their banquets.\r\n\r\n[68] A number of the Illustrated London News, of December, 1857,\r\nor January, 1858, contains a clever drawing, by an accomplished\r\nartist, of the mode of travelling over this road, under the title,\r\n\"A macadamized road in Manila.\"\r\n\r\n[69] Erd and Picketing, of the United States exploring expedition,\r\ndetermined the height to be 6,500 English feet (7,143 Spanish),\r\nnot an unsatisfactory result, considering the imperfect means they\r\npossessed for making a proper measurement. In the Manila Estado\r\ngeographico for 1865, the height is given, without any statement as\r\nto the source whence the estimate is derived, as 7,030 feet. The same\r\nauthority says, \"the large volcano is extinct since 1730, in which\r\nyear its last eruption took place. The mountain burst into flames on\r\nthe southern side, threw up streams of water, burning lava, and stones\r\nof an enormous size; traces of the last can be observed as far as the\r\nvillage of Sariaya. The crater is perhaps a league in circumference,\r\nit is highest on the northern side, and its interior is shaped like\r\nan egg-shell: the depth of the crater apparently extends half-way\r\ndown the height of the mountain.\"\r\n\r\n[70] From ponte, deck; a two-masted vessel, with mat sails, of about\r\n100 tons burden.\r\n\r\n[71] Estado Geogr., p. 314.\r\n\r\n[72] Officially called Cagsaua. The old town of Cagsaua, which was\r\nbuilt higher up the hill and was destroyed by the eruption of 1814,\r\nwas rebuilt on the spot where formerly stood a small hamlet of the\r\nname of Daraga.\r\n\r\n[73] I learnt from Mr. Paton that the undertaking had also been\r\nrepresented as impracticable in Albay. \"Not a single Spaniard, not\r\na single native had ever succeeded in reaching the summit; in spite\r\nof all their precautions they would certainly be swallowed up in the\r\nsand.\" However, one morning, about five o'clock, they set off, and soon\r\nreached the foot of the cone of the crater. Accompanied by a couple of\r\nnatives, who soon left them, they began to make the ascent. Resting\r\nhalf way up, they noticed frequent masses of shining lava, thrown\r\nfrom the mouth of the crater, gliding down the mountain. With the\r\ngreatest exertions they succeeded, between two and three o'clock,\r\nin reaching the summit, where, however, they were prevented by the\r\nnoxious gas from remaining more than two or three minutes. During\r\ntheir descent, they restored their strength with some refreshments\r\nSr. Muñoz had sent to meet them; and they reached Albay towards\r\nevening, where during their short stay they were treated as heroes,\r\nand presented with an official certificate of their achievement,\r\nfor which they had the pleasure of paying several dollars.\r\n\r\n[74] From 36,000,000 to 40,000,000 lbs. of cacao are consumed in Europe\r\nannually; of which quantity nearly a third goes to France, whose\r\nconsumption of it between 1853 and 1866 has more than doubled. In\r\nthe former year it amounted to 6,215,000 lbs., in the latter to\r\n12,973,534 lbs. Venezuela sends the finest cacaos to the European\r\nmarket, those of Porto Cabello and Caracas. That of Caracas is the\r\ndearest and the best, and is of four kinds: Chuao, Ghoroni, O'Cumar,\r\nand Rio Chico. England consumes the cacao grown in its own colonies,\r\nalthough the duty (1d per lb.) is the same for all descriptions. Spain,\r\nthe principal consumer, imports its supplies from Cuba, Porto Rico,\r\nEcuador, Mexico, and Trinidad. Several large and important plantations\r\nhave recently been established by Frenchmen in Nicaragua. The cacao\r\nbeans of Soconusco (Central America) and Esmeralda (Ecuador) are more\r\nhighly esteemed than the finest of the Venezuela sorts; but they are\r\nscarcely ever used in the Philippines, and cannot be said to form\r\npart of their commerce. Germany contents itself with the inferior\r\nkinds. Guayaquil cacao, which is only half the price of Caracas, is\r\nmore popular amongst the Germans than all the other varieties together.\r\n\r\n[75] C. Scherzer, in his work on Central America, gives the cacao-tree\r\nan existence of twenty years, and says that each tree annually produces\r\nfrom 15 to 20 ounces of cacao. 1,000 plants will produce 1,250 lbs. of\r\ncacao, worth $250; so that the annual produce of a single tree is worth\r\na quarter of a dollar. Mitscherlich says that from 4 to 6 lbs. of raw\r\nbeans is an average produce. A liter of dried cacao beans weighs 630\r\ngrains; of picked and roasted, 610 grains.\r\n\r\n[76] In 1727 a hurricane destroyed at a single blast the important\r\ncacao plantation of Martinique, which had been created by long years of\r\nextraordinary care. The same thing happened at Trinidad.--Mitscherlich.\r\n\r\n[77] F. Engel mentions a disease (mancha) which attacks the tree\r\nin America, beginning by destroying its roots. The tree soon dies,\r\nand the disease spreads so rapidly that whole groves of cacao-trees\r\nutterly perish and are turned into pastures for cattle. Even in the\r\nmost favored localities, after a long season of prosperity, thousands\r\nof trees are destroyed in a single night by this disease, just as the\r\nharvest is about to take place. An almost equally dangerous foe to\r\ncultivation is a moth whose larva entirely destroys the ripe cacao\r\nbeans; and which only cold and wind will kill. Humboldt mentions\r\nthat cacao beans which have been transported over the chilly passes\r\nof the Cordilleras are never attacked by this pest.\r\n\r\n[78] G. Bornoulli quotes altogether eighteen kinds; of which he\r\nmentions only one as generally in use in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[79] Pili is very common in South Luzon, Samar, and Leyte; it is to be\r\nfound in almost every village. Its fruit, which is almost of the size\r\nof an ordinary plum but not so round, contains a hard stone, the raw\r\nkernel of which is steeped in syrup and candied in the same manner as\r\nthe kernel of the sweet pine, which it resembles in flavor. The large\r\ntrees with fruit on them, \"about the size of almonds and looking like\r\nsweet-pine kernels,\" which Pigafetta saw at Jomonjol were doubtless\r\npili-trees. An oil is expressed from the kernels much resembling\r\nsweet almond oil. If incisions are made in the stems of the trees,\r\nan abundant pleasant-smelling white resin flows from them, which\r\nis largely used in the Philippines to calk ships with. It also has\r\na great reputation as an anti-rheumatic plaster. It is twenty years\r\nsince it was first exported to Europe; and the first consignees made\r\nlarge profits, as the resin, which was worth scarcely anything in\r\nthe Philippines, became very popular and was much sought in Europe.\r\n\r\n[80] The general name for the beverage was Cacahoa-atl (cacao\r\nwater). Chocolatl was the term given to a particular kind. F. Hernandez\r\nfound four kinds of cacao in use among the Axtecs, and he describes\r\nfour varieties of drinks that were prepared from them. The third\r\nwas called chocolatl, and apparently was prepared as follows:--Equal\r\nquantities of the kernels of the pochotl (Bombaz ceiba) and cacahoatl\r\n(cacao) trees were finely ground, and heated in an earthen vessel, and\r\nall the grease removed as it rose to the surface. Maize, crushed and\r\nsoaked, was added to it, and a beverage prepared from the mixture; to\r\nwhich the oily parts that had been skimmed off the top were restored,\r\nand the whole was drunk hot.\r\n\r\n[81] Berthold Seemann speaks of a tree with finger-shaped leaves\r\nand small round berries, which the Indians sometimes offered for\r\nsale. They made chocolate from them, which in flavor much surpassed\r\nthat usually made from cacao.\r\n\r\n[82] Report of the French consul.\r\n\r\n[83] Mysore and Mocha coffees fetch the highest prices. From $20 to\r\n$22.50 per cwt. is paid for Mysore; and as much as $30, when it has\r\nattained an age of five or six years, for Mocha.\r\n\r\n[84] In 1865-66-67 California imported three and one-half, eight\r\nand ten million lbs. of coffee, of which two, four and five millions\r\nrespectively came from Manila. In 1868 England was the best customer\r\nof the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[85] Report of the Belgian consul.\r\n\r\n[86] Coffee is such an exquisite beverage, and is so seldom\r\nproperly prepared, that the following hints from a master in the\r\nart (Report of the Jury, Internat. Exhib., Paris, 1868) will not be\r\nunwelcome:--1st. Select good coffees. 2nd. Mix them in the proper\r\nproportions. 3rd. Thoroughly dry the beans; otherwise in roasting them\r\na portion of the aroma escapes with the steam. 4th. Roast them in a dry\r\natmosphere, and roast each quality separately. 5th. Allow them to cool\r\nrapidly. If it is impossible to roast the beans at home, then purchase\r\nonly sufficient for each day's consumption. With the exception of the\r\nfourth, however, it is easy to follow all these directions at home;\r\nand small roasting machines are purchasable, in which, with the aid\r\nof a spirit lamp, small quantities can be prepared at a time. It is\r\nbest, when possible, to buy coffee in large quantities, and keep it\r\nstored for two or three years in a dry place.\r\n\r\n[87] A creeping, or rather a running fern, nearly the only one of\r\nthe kind in the whole species.\r\n\r\n[88] The official accounts stated that they had kidnapped twenty-one\r\npersons in a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\n[89] Le Gentil, in his Travels in the Indian Seas, (1761) says:\r\n\"The monks are the real rulers of the provinces.... Their power is so\r\nunlimited that no Spaniard cares to settle in the neighborhood.... The\r\nmonks would give him a great deal of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n[90] St. Croix.\r\n\r\n[91] St. Croix.\r\n\r\n[92] There are three classes of alcaldeships, namely, entrada,\r\nascenso, and termino (vide Royal Ordinances of March, 1837); in\r\neach of which an alcalde must serve for three years. No official is\r\nallowed, under any pretence, to serve more than ten years in any of\r\nthe Asiatic magistracies.\r\n\r\n[93] The law limiting the duration of appointments to this short\r\nperiod dates from the earliest days of Spanish colonization in\r\nAmerica. There was also a variety of minor regulations, based on\r\nsuspicion, prohibiting the higher officials from mixing in friendly\r\nintercourse with the colonists.\r\n\r\n[94] A secular priest in the Philippines once related to me, quite of\r\nhis own accord, what had led him to the choice of his profession. One\r\nday, when he was a non-commissioned officer in the army, he was playing\r\ncards with some comrades in a shady balcony. \"See,\" cried one of his\r\nfriends, observing a peasant occupied in tilling the fields in the\r\nfull heat of the sun, \"how the donkey yonder is toiling and perspiring\r\nwhile we are lolling in the shade.\" The happy conceit of letting the\r\ndonkeys work while the idle enjoyed life made such a deep impression on\r\nhim that he determined to turn priest; and it is the same felicitous\r\nthought that has impelled so many impecunious gentlemen to become\r\ncolonial officials. The little opening for civil labor in Spain and\r\nPortugal, and the prospect of comfortable perquisites in the colonies,\r\nhave sent many a starving caballero across the ocean.\r\n\r\n[95] The exploitation of the State by party, and the exploitation of\r\nparty by individuals, are the real secrets of all revolutions in the\r\nPeninsula. They are caused by a constant and universal struggle for\r\noffice. No one will work, and everybody wants to live luxuriously; and\r\nthis can only be done at the expense of the State, which all attempt\r\nto turn and twist to their own ends. Shortly after the expulsion of\r\nIsabella, an alcalde's appointment has been known to have been given\r\naway three times in one day. (Prussian Year-Book, January, 1869.)\r\n\r\n[96] According to Grunow, Cladophona arrisgona Kuetzing--Conferva\r\narrisgona Montague.\r\n\r\n[97] A visita is a small hamlet or village with no priest of its\r\nown, and dependent upon its largest neighbor for its religious\r\nministrations.\r\n\r\n[98]  Pigafetta mentions that the female musicians of the King of\r\nCebu were quite naked, or only covered with an apron of bark. The\r\nladies of the Court were content with a hat, a short cloak, and a\r\ncloth around the waist.\r\n\r\n[99]  Perhaps the same reason induced the Chinese to purchase\r\ncrucifixes at the time of their first intercourse with the Portuguese;\r\nfor Pigafetta says: \"The Chinese are white, wear clothes, and eat\r\nfrom tables. They also possess crucifixes but it is difficult to say\r\nwhy or where they got them.\"\r\n\r\n[100] One line here omitted.--C.\r\n\r\n[101] Apud Camarines quoque terrain eodem die quator decies\r\ncontremuisse, fide dignis testimoniis renuntiatum est: multa interim\r\naedificia diruta.

Good Manila horses are of the latter\r\ntype, and are much prized by the Europeans in Chinese seaport towns.\r\n\r\n[113] Compare Hernandez, Opera Omnia; Torquemada, Monarchia Indica.\r\n\r\n[114] Buyo is the name given in the Philippines to the preparation of\r\nbetel suitable for chewing. A leaf of betel pepper (Chavica betel),\r\nof the form and size of a bean-leaf, is smeared over with a small\r\npiece of burnt lime of the size of a pea, and rolled together from\r\nboth ends to the middle; when, one end of the roll being inserted\r\ninto the other, a ring is formed, into which a smooth piece of areca\r\nnut of corresponding size is introduced.\r\n\r\n[115] Twelve lines are omitted here.--C.\r\n\r\n[116] 4 lines are omitted.--C.\r\n\r\n[117] In the country it is believed that swine's flesh often causes\r\nthis malady.

Amongst the\r\nTinguianes (North Luzon) the worst of all curses is to this effect:\r\n\"May'st thou die sleeping!\"--Informe, i. 14.\r\n\r\n[121] Lewin (\"Chittagong Hill Tracks,\" 1869, p. 46) relates of\r\nthe mountain people at that place: \"Their manner of kissing is\r\npeculiar. Instead of pressing lip to lip, they place the mouth and\r\nnose upon the cheek, and inhale the breath strongly. Their form of\r\nspeech is not 'Give me a kiss,' but 'Smell me.' \"\r\n\r\n[122] Probably pot-stone, which is employed in China in the manufacture\r\nof cheap ornaments.

A knot\r\nin the middle of the string prevents its sliding below that point,\r\nand, every touch drawing it from its equilibrium, it is impossible\r\nfor rats to climb upon it.

These\r\nare hemispherical in form, and consist for the most part of coir\r\n(coco fibers); and, as if prepared by the hand of man, the whole\r\ninterior is covered with an irregular net-work of fine threads of\r\nthe glutinous edible substance, as well as the upper edge, which\r\nswells gently outwards from the center towards the sides, and expands\r\ninto two wing-shaped prolongations, resting on one another, by which\r\nthe nest is fixed to the wall. Dr. v.

Bernaldez (\"Guerra al Sur\") the number of\r\nSpaniards and Filipinos kidnapped and killed within thirty years\r\namounted to twenty thousand.\r\n\r\n[156] The richly laden Nao (Mexican galleon) acted in this way.\r\n\r\n[157] Extract from a letter of the alcalde to the captain-general,\r\nJune 20, '60:--\"For ten days past ten pirate vessels have been lying\r\nundisturbed at the island of San Miguel, two leagues from Tabaco, and\r\ninterrupt the communication with the island of Catanduanes and the\r\neastern part of Albay. * * * They have committed several robberies,\r\nand carried off six men. Nothing can be done to resist them as there\r\nare no fire-arms in the villages, and the only two faluas have been\r\ndetained in the roads of San Bernardino by stress of weather.\"\r\n\r\nLetter of June 25:--\"Besides the above private ships four large pancos\r\nand four small vintas have made their appearance in the straits of\r\nSan Bernardino. * * * Their force amounts from four hundred and fifty\r\nto five hundred men. * * * Already they have killed sixteen men,\r\nkidnapped ten, and captured one ship.\"\r\n\r\n[158] In Chamisso's time it was even worse. \"The expeditions\r\nin armed vessels, which were sent from Manila to cruise against\r\nthe enemy (the pirates) * * * serve only to promote smuggling,\r\nand Christians and Moros avoid one another with equal diligence\r\non such occasions.\" (\"Observations and Views,\" p. 73.) * * * Mas\r\n(i. iv. 43) reports to the same effect, according to notices from the\r\nsecretary-general's office at Manila, and adds that the cruisers sold\r\neven the royal arms and ammunition, which had been entrusted to them,\r\nwhence much passed into the hands of the Moros. The alcaldes were\r\nsaid to influence the commanders of the cruisers, and the latter\r\nto overreach the alcaldes; but both usually made common cause. La\r\nPérouse also relates (ii., p. 357), that the alcaldes bought a very\r\nlarge number of persons who had been made slaves by the pirates\r\n(in the Philippines); so that the latter were not usually brought to\r\nBatavia where they were of much less value.\r\n\r\n[159] According to the Diario de Manila, March 14, 1866, piracy on\r\nthe seas had diminished, but had not ceased. Paragua, Calamianes,\r\nMindoro, Mindanao, and the Bisayas still suffer from it. Robberies and\r\nkidnapping are frequently carried on as opportunity favors; and such\r\ncasual pirates are to be extirpated only by extreme severity. According\r\nto my latest accounts, piracy is again on the increase.\r\n\r\n[160] The Spaniards attempted the conquest of the Sulu Islands in\r\n1628, 1629, 1637, 1731, and 1746; and frequent expeditions have since\r\ntaken place by way of reprisals. A great expedition was likewise sent\r\nout in October, 1871, against Sulu, in order to restrain the piracy\r\nwhich recently was getting the upper hand; indeed, a year or two\r\nago, the pirates had ventured as far as the neighborhood of Manila;\r\nbut in April of this year (1872) the fleet returned to Manila without\r\nhaving effected its object. The Spaniards employed in this expedition\r\nalmost the whole marine force of the colony, fourteen ships, mostly\r\nsteam gunboats; and they bombarded the chief town without inflicting\r\nany particular damage, while the Moros withdrew into the interior,\r\nand awaited the Spaniards (who, indeed, did not venture to land) in\r\na well-equipped body of five thousand men. After months of inactivity\r\nthe Spaniards burnt down an unarmed place on the coast, committing many\r\nbarbarities on the occasion, but drew back when the warriors advanced\r\nto the combat. The ports of the Sulu archipelago are closed to trade\r\nby a decree, although it is questionable whether all navigators\r\nwill pay any regard to it. Not long since the sovereignty of his\r\ndistrict was offered by the Sultan of Sulu to the King of Prussia;\r\nbut the offer was declined.\r\n\r\n[161] The Diario de Manila of June 4, 1866, states:--\"Yesterday the\r\nmilitary commission, established by ordinance of the 3rd August,\r\n1865, discontinued its functions. The ordinary tribunals are again\r\nin force. The numerous bands of thirty, forty, and more individuals,\r\narmed to the teeth, which have left behind them their traces of\r\nblood and fire at the doors of Manila and in so many other places,\r\nare annihilated. * * * More than fifty robbers have expiated their\r\ncrimes on the gallows, and one hundred and forty have been condemned\r\nto presidio (forced labor) or to other punishments.\"\r\n\r\n[162] According to Arenas (\"Memorias,\" 21) Albay was formerly called\r\nIbalon; Tayabas, Calilaya; Batangas, Comintan; Negros, Buglas; Cebu,\r\nSogbu; Mindoro, Mait; Samar, Ibabao; and Basilan, Taguima. Mindanao\r\nis called Cesarea by B. de la Torre, and Samar, by R. Dudleo\r\n\"Arcano del Mare\" (Florence, 1761), Camlaia. In Hondiv's map of the\r\nIndian islands (Purchas, 605) Luzon is Luconia; Samar, Achan; Leyte,\r\nSabura; Camarines, Nebui. In Albo's \"Journal,\" Cebu is called Suba;\r\nand Leyte, Seilani. Pigafetta describes a city called Cingapola in\r\nZubu, and Leyte, on his map, is in the north called Baybay, and in\r\nthe south Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[163] No mention is made of it in the Estado geografico of the\r\nFranciscans, published at Manila in 1855.\r\n\r\n[164] Small ships which have no cannon should be provided with pitchers\r\nfilled with water and the fruit of the sacchariferous arenga, for the\r\npurpose of be sprinkling the pirates, in the event of an attack, with\r\nthe corrosive mixture, which causes a burning heat. Dumont d'Urville\r\nmentions that the inhabitants of Solo had, during his visit, poisoned\r\nthe wells with the same fruit. The kernels preserved in sugar are an\r\nagreeable confection.\r\n\r\n[165] There were also elected a teniente mayor (deputy of the\r\ngobernadorcillo, a juez mayor (superior judge) for the fields, who is\r\nalways an ex-captain; a second judge for the police; a third judge\r\nfor disputes relating to cattle; a second and third teniente; and\r\nfirst and second policemen; and finally, in addition, a teniente,\r\na judge, and a policeman for each visita. All three of the judges\r\ncan be ex-capitanes, but no ex-capitan can be teniente. The first\r\nteniente must be taken from the higher class, the others may belong\r\neither to that or to the common people. The policemen (alguacils)\r\nare always of the latter class.\r\n\r\n[166] G. Squier (\"States of Central America,\" 192) mentions a block\r\nof mahogany, seventeen feet in length, which, at its lowest section,\r\nmeasured five feet six, inches square, and contained altogether five\r\nhundred fifty cubic feet.\r\n\r\n[167] According to Dr. V. Martens, Modiola striatula, Hanley, who found\r\nthe same bivalve at Singapore, in brackish water, but considerably\r\nlarger. Reeve also delineates the species collected by Cumming in the\r\nPhilippines, without precise mention of the locality, as being larger\r\n(38 mm.), that from Catarman being 17 mm.\r\n\r\n[168] In Sumatra Wallace saw, in the twilight, a lemur run up the trunk\r\nof a tree, and then glide obliquely through the air to another trunk,\r\nby which he nearly reached the ground. The distance between the two\r\ntrees amounted to 210 feet, and the difference of height was not above\r\n35 or 40 feet; consequently, less than l:5.--(\"Malay Archipelago,\"\r\ni. 211).\r\n\r\n[169] According to W. Peters, Tropidolaenus Philippinensis, Gray.\r\n\r\n[170] V. Martens identified amongst the tertiary mussels of the\r\nbanks of clay the following species, which still live in the Indian\r\nOcean:--Venus (Hemitapes) hiantina, Lam.; V. squamosa, L.; Arca\r\ncecillei, Phil.; A. inaequivalvis, Brug.; A. chalcanthum, Rv., and\r\nthe genera Yoldia, Pleurotoma, Cuvieria, Dentalium, without being\r\nable to assert their identity with living species.\r\n\r\n[171] Tarsius spectrum, Tem.; in the language of the country--mago.\r\n\r\n[172] Father Camel mentions that the little animal is said to live\r\nonly on coal, but that it was an error, for he ate the ficus Indica\r\n(by which we here understand him to mean the banana) and other\r\nfruits.

S. 2197.\r\n\r\n[173] The following communication appeared for the first time in\r\nthe reports of a session of the Anthropological Society of Berlin;\r\nbut my visitors were there denominated Palaos islanders. But,\r\nas Prof. Semper, who spent a long time on the true Palaos (Pelew)\r\nislands, correctly shows in the \"Corresp.-Bl. f. Anthropol.,\" 1871,\r\nNo. 2, that Uliai belongs to the group of the Carolinas, I have here\r\nretained the more common expression, Micronesian, although those men,\r\nrespecting whose arrival from Uliai no doubt existed, did not call\r\nthemselves Caroline islanders, but Palaos. As communicated to me by\r\nDr. Graeffe, who lived many years in Micronesia, Palaos is a loose\r\nexpression like Kanaka and many others, and does not, at all events,\r\napply exclusively to the inhabitants of the Pelew group.\r\n\r\n[174] Dumont d'Urville, Voyage to the South Pole, v. 206, remarks\r\nthat the natives call their island Gouap or Ouap, but never Yap;\r\nand that the husbandry in that place was superior to anything he had\r\nseen in the South Sea.\r\n\r\n[175] The voyages of the Polynesians were also caused by the tyranny\r\nof the victorious parties, which compelled the vanquished to emigrate.\r\n\r\n[176] Pigafetta, p. 51.\r\n\r\n[177] Morga, f. 127.\r\n\r\n[178] \"The Bisayans cover their teeth with a shining varnish, which\r\nis either black, or of the color of fire, and thus their teeth become\r\neither black, or red like cinnabar; and they make a small hole in\r\nthe upper row, which they fill with gold, the latter shining all the\r\nmore on the black or red ground.\"--(Thévenot, Religieux, 54.) Of a\r\nking of Mindanao, visited by Magellan at Massana, it is written:--\"In\r\nevery tooth he had three machie (spots?) of gold, so that they had\r\nthe appearance of being tied together with gold;\" which Ramusio\r\ninterprets--\"On each finger he had three rings of gold.\"--Pigafetta,\r\np. 66; and compare also Carletti, Voyages, i. 153.\r\n\r\n[179] 42 and 30 Cent. or 108 and 86 Fahr.--C.\r\n\r\n[180] In one of these cliffs, sixty feet above the sea, beds of mussels\r\nwere found: ostrea, pinna, chama; according to Dr. V.

The coffin is cut out of\r\nthe branch of a tree by the nearest male kinsman, and it is so narrow\r\nthat the body has to be pressed down into it, lest another member\r\nof the family should die immediately after to fill up the gap. As\r\nmany as possible of his effects must be heaped on the dead person,\r\nin order to prove his wealth and to raise him in the estimation of\r\nthe spirit world; and under the coffin are placed two vessels, one\r\ncontaining rice and the other water.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal ceremonies of the tiwa consisted formerly\r\n(and does still in some places) in human sacrifices. Where the Dutch\r\nGovernment extended these were not permitted; but sometimes carabaos\r\nor pigs were killed in a cruel manner, with the blood of which the\r\nhigh priest smeared the forehead, breast, and arms of the head of the\r\nfamily. Similar sacrifices of slaves or pigs were practised amongst\r\nthe ancient Filipinos, with peculiar ceremonies by female priests\r\n(Catalonas).\r\n\r\n[182] In the chapter De monstris et quasi monstris * * * of Father\r\nCamel, London Philos. Trans., p. 2259, it is stated that in the\r\nmountains between Guiuan and Borongan, footsteps, three times as\r\nlarge as those of ordinary men, have been found. Probably the skulls\r\nof Lauang, which are pressed out in breadth, and covered with a thick\r\ncrust of calcareous sinter, the gigantic skulls (skulls of giants)\r\nhave given rise to the fable of the giants' footsteps.\r\n\r\n[183] Hemiramphus viviparus, W.

The price at Manila refers to the tinaja of sixteen\r\ngantas.\r\n\r\n[187] Newly prepared coconut oil serves for cooking, but quickly\r\nbecomes rancid. It is very generally used for lighting. In Europe,\r\nwhere it seldom appears in a fluid state, as it does not dissolve until\r\n16° R., (20 C. or 68 Fahr.) it is used in the manufacture of tapers,\r\nbut especially for soap, for which it is peculiarly adapted. Coconut\r\nsoap is very hard, and brilliantly white, and is dissolved in salt\r\nwater more easily than any other soap. The oily nut has lately been\r\nimported from Brazil into England under the name of \"copperah,\"\r\n(copra) and pressed after heating.\r\n\r\n[188] On Pigafetta's map Leyte is divided into two parts, the north\r\nbeing called Baibay, and the south Ceylon. When Magellan in Massana\r\n(Limasana) inquired after the most considerable places of business,\r\nCeylon (i.e. Leyte), Calagan (Caraga), and Zubu (Cebu) were named to\r\nhim. Pigaf., 70.\r\n\r\n[189] According to Dr. Gerstaecker: Oedipoda subfasciata, Haan,\r\nAcridium Manilense, Meyen. The designation of Meyen which the\r\nsystemists must have overlooked, has the priority of Haan's; but it\r\nrequires to be altered to Oedipoda Manilensis, as the species does not\r\nbelong to the genus acridium in the modern sense. It occurs also in\r\nLuzon and in Timor, and is closely allied to our European migratory\r\nlocusts Oedipoda migratoria.\r\n\r\n[190] After the king had withdrawn * * * \"sweetmeats and cakes in\r\nabundance were brought, and also roasted locusts, which were pressed\r\nupon the guests as great delicacies.\"--\"Col.

Crawfurd (\"Dict.\" 339) thinks these\r\nfacts not firmly established, and they are certainly not mentioned\r\nby Pigafetta; who, however, writes, p. 80:--\"He (the king of Zubut)\r\nwas ... painted in various ways with fire.\" Purchas (\"Pilgrimage,\"\r\nfo. i. 603)--\"The king of Zubut has his skinne painted with a hot\r\niron pensill;\" and Morga, fo. 4--\"Traen todo il cuerpo labrado con\r\nfuego.\" From this they appear to have tattooed themselves in the manner\r\nof the Papuas, by burning in spots and stripes into the skin. But\r\nMorga states in another place (f. 138)--\"They are distinguished\r\nfrom the inhabitants of Luzon by their hair which the men cut into\r\na pigtail after the old Spanish manner, and paint their bodies in\r\nmany patterns, without touching the face.\" The custom of tattooing,\r\nwhich appears to have ceased with the introduction of Christianity,\r\nfor the clergymen so often quoted (Thevenot, p. 4) describes it as\r\nunknown, cannot be regarded as a characteristic of the Bisayans;\r\nand the tribes of the northern part of Luzon tattoo at the present day.\r\n\r\n[198] Mezzeria (Italian); métayer (French).\r\n\r\n[199] In China an oil is procured from the seeds of vernicia montana,\r\nwhich, by the addition of alum, litharge, and steatite, with a gentle\r\nheat, easily forms a valuable varnish which, when mixed with resin, is\r\nemployed in rendering the bottoms of vessels watertight. P. Champion,\r\nIndust. Anc. et Mod. de l'Emp. Chinois.\" 114.\r\n\r\n[200] Petzholdt (\"Caucasus,\" i. 203) mentions that in Bosslewi the\r\nprice of a clay vessel is determined by its capacity of maize.\r\n\r\n[201] As usual these abuses spring from the non-enforcement of a\r\nstatute passed in 1848 (Leg. ult., i. 144), which prohibits usurious\r\nconracts with servants or assistants, and threatens with heavy\r\npenalties all those whom, under the pretext of having advanced money,\r\nor of having paid debts or the poll-tax or exemption from service,\r\nkeep either individual natives or whole families in a continual\r\nstate of dependence upon them, and always secure the increase of\r\ntheir obligations to them by not allowing them wages sufficient to\r\nenable them to satisfy the claims against them.\r\n\r\n[202] Formerly it appears to have been different with them. \"These\r\nBisayans are a people little disposed to agriculture, but practised\r\nin navigation, and eager for war and expeditions by sea, on account\r\nof the pillage and prizes, which they call 'mangubas,' which is the\r\nsame as taking to the field in order to steal.\"--Morga, f. 138.\r\n\r\n[203] Ill-usage prevails to a great extent, although prohibited\r\nby a stringent law; the non-enforcement of which by the alcaldes\r\nis charged with a penalty of 100 dollars for every single case of\r\nneglect. In many provinces the bridegroom pays to the bride's mother,\r\nbesides the dower, an indemnity for the rearing (\"mother's milk\")\r\nwhich the bride has enjoyed (bigay susu). According to Colin (\"Labor\r\nEvangelico,\" p. 129) the penhimuyal, the present which the mother\r\nreceived for night-watching and care during the bringing up of the\r\nbride, amounted to one-fifth of the dowry.\r\n\r\n[204] The Asuang is the ghoul of the Arabian Nights' tales.--C.\r\n\r\n[205] Veritable cannibals are not mentioned by the older authors on\r\nthe Philippines. Pigafetta (p. 127) heard that a people lived on a\r\nriver at Cape Benuian (north of Mindanao) who ate only the hearts\r\nof their captured enemies, along with lemon-juice; and Dr. Semper\r\n(\"Philippines,\") in '62 found the same custom, with the exception of\r\nthe lemon-juice, on the east coast of Mindanao.\r\n\r\n[206] The Anito occurs amongst the tribes of the Malayan Archipelago\r\nas Antu, but the Anito of the Philippines is essentially a protecting\r\nspirit, while the Malayan Antu is rather of a demoniacal kind.\r\n\r\n[207] These idol images have never come under my observation. Those\r\nfigured in Bastian and Hartmann's Journal of Ethnology\r\n(b. i. pl. viii. Idols from the Philippines,) whose originals are in\r\nthe Ethnographical Museum of Berlin, were certainly acquired in the\r\nPhilippines, but, according to A. W. Franks, undoubtedly belong to\r\nthe Solomon Islands. Sections ii. to viii., p. 46, in the catalogue\r\nof the Museum at Prague are entitled:--\"Four heads of idols, made of\r\nwood, from the Philippines, contributed by the Bohemian naturalist\r\nThaddaeus Haenke, who was commissioned by the King of Spain, in the\r\nyear 1817, to travel in the islands of the South Sea.\" The photographs,\r\nwhich were obligingly sent here at my request by the direction of the\r\nmuseum, do not entirely correspond to the above description, pointing\r\nrather to the west coast of America, the principal field of Haenke's\r\nresearches. The Reliquiae Botanicae, from his posthumous papers,\r\nlikewise afford no information respecting the origin of these idols.\r\n\r\n[208] On the Island of Panay.\r\n\r\n[209] As an example, in anticipation of an attack on Cogseng, all\r\nthe available forces, including those of Zamboanga, were collected\r\nround Manila, and the Moros attacked the island with sixty ships,\r\nwhereas formerly their armaments used not to exceed six or eight\r\nships.

In the experiments made at the laboratory\r\nof the School of Mines in Madrid it yielded four per cent. of ashes,\r\nand a heating power of 4,825 caloria; i.e., by the burning of one\r\npart by weight 4,825 parts by weight of water were heated to 1°\r\nC. Good pit-coal gives 6,000 cal. The first coal pits in Cebu were\r\nexcavated in the Massanga valley; but the works were discontinued in\r\n1859, after considerable outlay had been made on them. Four strata of\r\nconsiderable thickness were subsequently discovered in the valley of\r\nAlpacó and in the mountain of Oling, in Naga. * * \"The coal of Cebu\r\nis acknowledged to be better than that of Australia and Labuan, but\r\nhas not sufficient heating power to be used, unmixed with other coal,\r\non long sea voyages.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the Catalogue of the Products of the Philippines (Manila,\r\n1866), the coal strata of Cebu have, at many places in the mountain\r\nrange which runs from north to south across the whole of the island,\r\nan average thickness of two miles. The coal is of middling quality,\r\nand is burnt in the Government steam works after being mixed with\r\nCardiff coal. The price in Cebu is on the average six dollars per ton.\r\n\r\n[212] English Consular Report, 217.\r\n\r\n[213] The man credited with the development of the sugar industry\r\nthrough machinery. A monument has been erected to his memory.--T.\r\n\r\n[214] In Jaro the leases have increased threefold in six years:\r\nand cattle which were worth $10 in 1860, fetched $25 in 1866. Plots\r\nof land on the \"Ria,\" in Iloilo, have risen from $100 to $500, and\r\neven as high as $800. (Diario, February 1867). These results are\r\nto be ascribed to the sugar trade, which, through free exportation,\r\nhas become extremely lucrative.\r\n\r\n[215] In 1855 Iloilo took altogether from Negros 3,000 piculs out of\r\n11,700; in 1860 as much as 90,000 piculs; in 1863, 176,000 piculs\r\n(in twenty-seven foreign ships); in 1866, 250,000 piculs; in 1871,\r\n312,379 picula from both islands.\r\n\r\n[216] The sugar intended for the English market cost in Manila,\r\nin the years 1868 and 1869, from £15 to £16 per ton, and fetched in\r\nLondon about £20 per ton. The best refined sugar prepared in Manila\r\nfor Australia was, on account of the higher duty, worth only £3 per\r\nton more in London; but, being £5 dearer than the inferior quality,\r\nit commanded a premium of £2. Manila exports the sugar chiefly from\r\nPangasinan, Pampanga, and Laguna.--(From private information.)\r\n\r\n[217] The Islands of the East Indian Archipelago, 1868, p. 340.\r\n\r\n[218] Exhibition Catalogue; section, French Colonies, 1867, p. 80.\r\n\r\n[219] Report of the Commissioners, Exhibition 1867, iv. 102. The South\r\nAmerican Indians have for a long time past employed the banana fiber\r\nin the manufacture of clothing material;--(The Technologist, September,\r\n1865, p. 89, from unauthenticated sources,) and in Loo Choo the banana\r\nfiber is the only kind in use (Faits Commerciaux, No. 1514. p. 36).\r\n\r\n[220] Abacá not readily taking tar is, consequently, only used for\r\nrunning, and not standing, rigging.\r\n\r\n[221] A plant in full growth produces annually 30 cwt. bandala to the\r\nacre, whereas from an acre of flax not more than from 2 to 4 cwt. of\r\npure flax, and from 2 to 8 cwt. seed can be obtained.\r\n\r\n[222] As Dr. Wittmack communicated to me, only fiber or seed can\r\nbe obtained from hemp, as when the hemp is ripe, i.e. run to seed,\r\nthe fiber becomes then both brittle and coarse. When cultivating flax\r\nvery often both seeds and fiber are used, but then they both are of\r\ninferior quality.\r\n\r\n[223] Flora de Filipinas.\r\n\r\n[224] In 1868, £100 per ton was paid for lupis, although only imported\r\nin small quantities--about five tons per annum--and principally used\r\nat one time in France in the manufacture of a particular kind of\r\nunderclothing. The fashion soon, however, died out. Quitol, a less\r\nvaluable sort of lupis, could be sold at £75 per ton.\r\n\r\n[225] Inflexibility is peculiar to all fibers of the Monocotyledons,\r\nbecause they consist of coarsely rounded cells. On the other hand,\r\nthe true bast fibers--the Dicotyledons (flax, for instance)--are\r\nthe reverse.\r\n\r\n[226] Through the agricultural system, also, the mestizos and natives\r\nsecure the work of their countrymen by making these advances, and\r\nrenewing them before the old ones are paid off. These thoughtless\r\npeople consequently fall deeper and deeper into debt, and become\r\nvirtually the peons of their creditors, it being impossible for them\r\nto escape in any way from their position. The \"part-share contract\" is\r\nmuch the same in its operative effects, the landlord having to supply\r\nthe farmer with agricultural implements and draught-cattle, and often\r\nin addition supplying the whole family with clothing and provisions;\r\nand, on division of the earnings, the farmer is unable to cover his\r\ndebt. It is true the Filipinos are responsible legally to the extent\r\nof five dollars only, a special enactment prohibiting these usurious\r\nbargains. As a matter of fact, however, they are generally practised.\r\n\r\n[227] This feeling of jealousy had very nearly the effect of closing\r\nthe new harbors immediately after they were opened.\r\n\r\n[228] Rapport Consulaire Belge, XIV., 68.\r\n\r\n[229] In the Agricultural Report of 1869, p. 232, another fiber was\r\nhighly mentioned, belonging to a plant very closely related to sisal\r\n(Bromelia Sylvestris), perhaps even a variety of the same. The Mexican\r\nname, jxtle, is possibly derived from the fact of their curiously\r\nflattened, spike-edged leaves, resembling the dentated knives formed\r\nfrom volcanic stone (obsidian) possessed by the Aztecs and termed by\r\nthem iztli.\r\n\r\n[230] The banana trees are well known to be among the most valuable\r\nof plants to mankind. In their unripe state they afford starch-flour;\r\nand when mature, they supply an agreeable and nutritious fruit, which,\r\nalthough partaken of freely, will produce neither unpleasantness nor\r\nany injurious after-effects. One of the best of the edible species\r\nbears fruit as early as five or six months after being planted,\r\nsuckers in the meantime constantly sprouting from the roots, so that\r\ncontinual fruit-bearing is going on, the labor of the growers merely\r\nbeing confined to the occasional cutting down of the old plants and\r\nto gathering in the fruit. The broad leaves afford to other young\r\nplants the shade which is so requisite in tropical countries, and are\r\nemployed in many useful ways about the house. Many a hut, too, has to\r\nthank the banana trees surrounding it from the conflagration, which,\r\ngenerally speaking, lays the village in ashes. I should here like to\r\nmake an observation upon a mistake which has spread rather widely. In\r\nBishop Pallegoix's excellent work, Description du Royaume Thai ou Siam,\r\nI*. 144, he says: \"L'arbre a vernis qui est une espece de bananier,\r\net que les Siamois appellent 'rak,' fournit ce beau vernis qu'on admire\r\ndans les petits meubles qu'on apporte de Chine.\" When I was in Bangkok,\r\nI called the attention of the amiable white-haired, and at that time\r\nnearly nonogenarian, bishop to this curious statement. Shaking his\r\nhead, he said he could not have written it.

In Algiers a large\r\nquantity of sparto (Alfa) grows but the cost of transport is too\r\nexpensive to admit of sending it to France.\r\n\r\n[232] The British Consul estimates the receipts from this monopoly for\r\nthe year 1866-7 at $8,418,939, after an expenditure of $4,519,866;\r\nthus leaving a clear profit of $3,899,073. In the colonial budget\r\nfor 1867 the profit on tobacco was estimated at $2,627,976, while\r\nthe total expenditure of the colony, after deduction of the expenses\r\noccasioned by the tobacco management, was set down at $7,033,576.\r\n\r\nAccording to the official tables of the chief of the Administration\r\nin Manila, 1871, the total annual revenue derived from the tobacco\r\nmanagement between the years 1865 and 1869 amounted, on an average,\r\nto $5,367,262. By reason of proper accounts being wanting an accurate\r\nestimate of the expenditure cannot be delivered; but it would be at\r\nleast $4,000,000, so that a profit of only $1,367,262 remains.\r\n\r\n[233] Instruccion general para la Direccion, Administracion, y\r\nIntervencion de las Rentas Estancadas, 1849.\r\n\r\n[234] Memoria sobre el Desestanco del Tabaco en las Islas\r\nFilipinas. Don J. S. Agius, Binondo (Manila), 1871.\r\n\r\n[235] The tobacco in China appears to have come from the\r\nPhilippines. \"The memoranda discovered in Wang-tao leave no possible\r\ndoubt that it was first introduced into South China from the Philippine\r\nIslands in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, most probably by\r\nway of Japan.\"--(Notes and Queries, China and Japan, May 31st, 1857.)\r\n\r\nFrom Schlegel, in Batavia, it was brought by the Portuguese into\r\nJapan somewhere between the years 1573 and 1591, and spread itself\r\nso rapidly in China that we find even as early as 1538, that the sale\r\nof it was forbidden under penalty of beheading.\r\n\r\nAccording to Notes and Queries, China and Japan, July 31, 1857,\r\nthe use of tobacco was quite common in the \"Manchu\" army. In a\r\nChinese work, Natural History Miscellany, it is written: \"Yen t'sao\r\n(literally smoke plant) was introduced into Fukien about the end of the\r\nWan-li Government, between 1573 and 1620, and was known as Tan-pa-ku\r\n(from Tombaku).\"\r\n\r\n[236] West Cuba produces the best tobacco, the famous Vuelta abajo,\r\n400,000 cwt. at from $14.28 to $99,96 the cwt.; picked sorts being\r\nvalued at from $571.20 to $714.00 per cwt. Cuba produces 640,000\r\ncwt. The cigars exhibited in the Paris Exhibition of 1867 were worth\r\nfrom $24.99 to $405.98 per thousand. The number of cigars annually\r\nexported is estimated at about 5,000,000. (Jury Report, v., 375.) In\r\nJenidje-Karasu (Salonica) 17,500 cwt. are obtained annually, of\r\nwhich 2,500 cwt. are of the first quality; the cost is $1.75 the oka\r\n(about .75 per lb.). Picked sorts are worth 15s. per lb., and even\r\nmore.--Saladin Bey, La Turquie a l'Exposition, p. 91.\r\n\r\n[237] In Cuba the tobacco industry is entirely free. The extraordinary\r\nincrease of the trade and the improved quality of the tobacco are,\r\nin great measure, to be ascribed to the honest competition existing\r\nbetween the factories, who receive no other protection from the\r\nGovernment than a recognition of their operations. --(Jury Report,\r\n1867, v., 375.)\r\n\r\n[238] Basco also introduced the cultivation of silk, and had 4,500,000\r\nmulberry trees planted in the Camarines. This industry, immediately\r\nupon his retirement, was allowed to fall into decay.\r\n\r\n[239] According to La Pérouse, this measure occasioned a revolt\r\nin all parts of the island, which had to be suppressed by force of\r\narms. In the same manner the monopoly introduced into America at the\r\nsame time brought about a dangerous insurrection, and was the means\r\nof reducing Venezuela to a state of extreme poverty, and, in fact,\r\nwas the cause of the subsequent downfall of the colony.\r\n\r\n[240] A fardo (pack) contains 40 manos (bundles); 1 mano=10 manojitos,\r\n1 manojito =10 leaves. Regulations, § 7.\r\n\r\n[241] Regulations for the tobacco collection agencies in\r\nLuzon.--1st. Four classes of Tobacco will be purchased. 2nd. These\r\nclasses are thus specified: the first to consist or leaves at\r\nleast 18 inches long (0m 418;) the second of leaves between 14 and\r\n18 inches (0m 325); the third of leaves between 10 and 14 inches\r\n(0m 232); and the fourth of leaves at least 7 inches in length (0m\r\n163). Smaller leaves will not be accepted. This last limitation,\r\nhowever, has recently been abandoned so that the quality of the\r\ntobacco is continually deprecinting in the hands of the Government,\r\nwho have added two other classes.\r\n\r\nA fardo, 1st class, weighs 60 lbs., and in 1867 the Government rate\r\nof pay was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1 Fardo, 1st class, 60 lbs $9.50\r\n    1 Fardo, 2nd class, 46 lbs 6.00\r\n    1 Fardo, 3rd class, 33 lbs 2.75\r\n    1 Fardo, 4th class, 18 lbs 1.00\r\n\r\n--English Consular Report.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the different brands of cigars manufactured\r\nby the Government, and the prices at which they could be bought in\r\n1867 in Estanco (i.e. a place privileged for the sale):--\r\n\r\n\r\nMenas (Classes.)

He is compelled to borrow money at\r\nan exorbitant rate of interest, and, consequently, sinks deeper and\r\ndeeper into debt and misery. The dread of fines or bodily punishment,\r\nrather than the prospect of high prices, is the chief method by which\r\nthe supplies can be kept up.--(Report of the English Consul.)\r\n\r\n[244] From December 1853 to November 1854 the colony possessed four\r\ncaptains-general (two effective and two provisional). In 1850 a new\r\nnominee, Oidor (member of the Supreme Court of Judicature) who with\r\nhis family voyaged to Manila by the Cape, found, upon his arrival,\r\nhis successor already in office, the latter having travelled by way\r\nof Suez. Such circumstances need not occasion surprise when it is\r\nremembered how such operations are repeated in Spain itself.\r\n\r\nAccording to an essay in the Revue Nationale, April, 1867, Spain\r\nhas had, from 1834 to 1862, i.e. since the accession of Isabella,\r\n4 Constitutions, 28 Parliaments, 47 Chief Ministers, 529 Cabinet\r\nMinisters, and 68 Ministers of the Interior; of which last class of\r\nofficials each, on an average, was in power only six months. For ten\r\nyears past the Minister of Finance has not remained in office longer\r\nthan two months; and since that time, particularly since 1868, the\r\nchanges have followed one another with still greater rapidity.\r\n\r\n[245] The reason of this premiun on silver was, that the Chinese bought\r\nup all the Spanish and Mexican dollars, in order to send them to China,\r\nwhere they are worth more than other dollars, being known from the\r\nvoyage of the galleon thither in olden times, and being current in\r\nthe inland provinces. (The highest price there can be obtained for\r\na Carlos III.)\r\n\r\nA mint erected in Manila since that time, which at least supports\r\nitself, if the goverment has derived no other advantage from it, has\r\nremoved this difficulty. The Chinese are accustomed to bring gold\r\nand silver as currency, mixed also with foreign coinage, to Manila\r\nfor the purpose of buying the produce of the country; and all this the\r\nnative merchants had recoined. At first only silver ounces were usually\r\nobtainable in Manila, gold ounces very rarely. This occasioned such a\r\nsteady importation that the conditions were completely reversed. In\r\nthe Insular Treasury the gold and silver dollar are always reckoned\r\nat the same value.\r\n\r\n[246] The Chinese were generally known in the Philippines as\r\n\"Sangleys\"; according to Professor Schott, \"sang-lui (in the south\r\nszang-loi, also senng-loi) mercatorum ordo.\" \"Sang\" is more specially\r\napplied to the travelling traders, in opposition to \"ku,\" tabernarii.\r\n\r\n[247] ...... \"They are a wicked and vicious people, and, owing to\r\ntheir numbers, and to their being such large eaters, they consume\r\nthe provisions and render them dear ......It is true the town cannot\r\nexist without the Chinese, as they are the workers in all the trades\r\nand business, and very industrious, and work for small wages; but\r\nfor that very reason a lesser number of them would be sufficient.\"--\r\nMorga, p. 349.\r\n\r\n[248] \"Recopilacion,\" Lib. iv., Tit. xviii., ley. 1.\r\n\r\n[249] \"Informe,\" I., iii., 73.\r\n\r\n[250] The Chinese were not permitted to live in the town, but in a\r\ndistrict specially set apart for them.\r\n\r\n[251] Velarde, 274.\r\n\r\n[252] See following chapter.\r\n\r\n[253] Zuñiga, xvi.\r\n\r\n[254] No single people in Europe can in any way compare with the\r\ninhabitants of California, which, in the early years of its existence,\r\nwas composed only of men in the prime of their strength and activity,\r\nwithout aged people, without women, and without children. Their\r\nactivity, in a country where everything had to be provided (no\r\ncivilised neighbors living within some hundred miles or so), and\r\nwhere all provisions were to be obtained only at a fabulous cost,\r\nwas stimulated to the highest pitch. Without here going into the\r\nparticulars of their history, it need only be remembered that they\r\nfounded, in twenty-five years, a powerful State, the fame of which has\r\nspread all over the world, and around whose borders young territories\r\nhave sprung into existence and flourished vigorously; two of them\r\nindeed having attained to the condition of independent States. After\r\nthe Californian gold-diggers had changed the configuration of the\r\nground of entire provinces by having, with Titanic might, deposited\r\nmasses of earth into the sea until they expanded into hilly districts,\r\nso as to obtain therefrom, with the aid of ingenious machinery, the\r\nsmallest particle of gold which was contained therein, they have\r\nastonished the world in their capacity of agriculturalists, whose\r\nproduce is sent even to the most distant markets, and everywhere takes\r\nthe first rank without dispute. Such mighty results have been achieved\r\nby a people whose total number scarcely, indeed, exceeds 500,000; and\r\ntherefore, perhaps, they may not find it an easy matter to withstand\r\nthe competition of the Chinese.\r\n\r\n[255] The rails, if laid in one continuous line, would measure about\r\n103,000 feet, the weight of them being 20,000 cwt. Eight Chinamen were\r\nengaged in the work, relieving one another by fours. These men were\r\nchosen to perform this feat on account of their particular activity,\r\nout of 10,000.\r\n\r\n(The translator of the 1875 London edition notes: \"This statement is\r\nincorrect, so far as the fact of the feat being accomplished by Chinese\r\nis concerned. Eight Europeans were engaged in this extraordinary\r\npiece of work. During the rejoicings which took place in Sacramento\r\nupon the opening of the line, these men were paraded in a van, with\r\nthe account of their splendid achievement painted in large letters\r\non the outside. Certainly not one of them was a Chinaman.\"--C.\r\n\r\n[256] Magellan fell on April 27, struck by a poisoned arrow, on\r\nthe small island of Mactan, lying opposite the harbor of Cebu. His\r\nlieutenant, Sebastian de Elcano, doubled the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nand on September 6, 1522, brought back one of the five ships with\r\nwhich Magellan set sail from St. Lucar in 1519, and eighteen men,\r\nwith Pigafetta, to the same harbor, and thus accomplished the first\r\nvoyage round the world in three years and fourteen days.\r\n\r\n[257] 1565 is the date for what is now the Philippines.--C.\r\n\r\n[258] Villalobos gave this name to one of the Southern islands and\r\nLegaspi extended it to the entire archipelago.--C.\r\n\r\n[259] \"According to recent authors they were also named after\r\nVillalobos in 1543.--Morga, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[260] According to Morga (p. 140) there was neither king nor governor,\r\nbut in each island and province were numerous persons of rank, whose\r\ndependants and subjects were divided into quarters (barrios) and\r\nfamilies. These petty rulers had to render homage by means of tributes\r\nfrom the crops (buiz), also by socage or personal service: but their\r\nrelations were exempted from such services as were rendered by the\r\nplebeians (timauas). The dignities of the chieftains were hereditary,\r\ntheir honors descended also to their wives. If a chief particularly\r\ndistinguished himself, then the rest followed him; but the Government\r\nretained to themselves the administration of the Barangays through\r\ntheir own particular officials. Concerning the system of slavery\r\nunder the native rule, Morga says (p. 41, abbreviated),--\"The natives\r\nof these islands are divided into three classes--nobles, timauas or\r\nplebeians, and the slaves of the former. There are different sorts\r\nof slaves: some in complete slavery (Saguiguilires), who work in\r\nthe house, as also their children. Others live with their families\r\nin their own houses and render service to their lords at sowing and\r\nharvest-time, also as boatmen, or in the construction of houses,\r\netc. They must attend as often as they are required, and give their\r\nservices without pay or recompense of any kind. They are called\r\nNamarnahayes; and their duties and obligations descend to their\r\nchildren and successors. Of these Saguiguilires and Namamahayes a\r\nfew are full slaves, some half slaves, and others quarter slaves.\r\n\r\nWhen, for instance, the mother or father was free, the only son\r\nwould be half free, half slave. Supposing there were several sons,\r\nthe first one inherits the father's position, the second that of the\r\nmother. When the number is unequal the last one is half free and half\r\nslave; and the descendants born of such half slayes and those who are\r\nfree are quarter slaves. The half slaves, whether or narnamahayes,\r\nserve their lords equally every month in turns. Half and quarter slaves\r\ncan, by reason of their being partially free, compel their lord to\r\ngive them their freedom at a previously determined and unfluctuating\r\nprice: but full slaves do not possess this right. A namamahaye is\r\nworth half as much as a saguiguilire. All slaves are natives.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, at p. 143, he writes:--\"A slave who has children by her lord\r\nis thereby freed together with her children. The latter, however,\r\nare not considered well born, and cannot inherit property; nor do the\r\nrights of nobility, supposing in such a case the father to possess any,\r\ndescend to them.\"\r\n\r\n[261] He made the Filipinos of his encomienda of Vigan his heirs,\r\nand has ever been held in grateful memory.--C.\r\n\r\n[262] Grav. 30.\r\n\r\n[263] Chamisso (\"Observations and Views,\" p. 72), thanks to the\r\ntranslator of Zuñiga, knew that he was in duty bound to dwell at\r\nsome length over this excellent history; though Zuñiga's narrative\r\nis always, comparatively speaking, short and to the point. The\r\njudiciously abbreviated English translation, however, contains many\r\nmiscomprehensions.\r\n\r\n[264] Principally by hiring the assassination of the gifted native\r\nleader, Silang.--C.\r\n\r\n[265] Danger to Europeans, \"Massacre of all white people,\" was a\r\nfrequent Spanish allegation in political disturbances, but the only\r\nproof ever given (the 9th degree Masonic apron stupidly attributed\r\nto the Katipunan in 1896) was absurd and irrelevant.--C.\r\n\r\n[266] Professor Jagor here follows the report sent out by the\r\nauthorities. There seems better ground for believing the affair to\r\nhave been merely a military mutiny over restricting rights which\r\nwas made a pretext for getting rid of those whose liberal views were\r\nobjectionable to the government.--C.\r\n\r\n[267] I take the liberty, here, of citing an instance of this. In 1861,\r\nwhen I found myself on the West Coast of Mexico, a dozen backwoods\r\nfamilies determined upon settling in Sonora (forming an oasis in\r\nthe desert); a plan which was frustrated by the invasion at that\r\ntime of the European powers. Many native farmers awaited the arrival\r\nof these immigrants in order to settle under their protection. The\r\nvalue of land in consequence of the announcement of the project rose\r\nvery considerably.\r\n\r\n[268] It is called so in consequence of the island being nearly\r\ndivided in the parallel of 14° N., by two bays.\r\n\r\n[269] Since my return home, at the desire of that distinguished\r\nagriculturist, Colonel Austin, of South Carolina, I have sent for\r\nsome samples of the different kinds, and under his care it will no\r\ndoubt be well treated.\r\n\r\n[270] On my arrival at Singapore, this circumstance was investigated by\r\na court of inquiry. The result showed that Mr. Knox had no knowledge\r\nof the Vincennes having been seen; for the officer of the watch had\r\nnot reported to him the fact.\r\n\r\n[271] Chewing the betelnut and pepper-leaf also produces this effect,\r\nand is carried to a great extent among these islanders.\r\n\r\n[272] The Sultan, on the visit of one of our merchant-vessels,\r\nhad informed the supercargo that he wished to encourage our trade,\r\nand to see the vessels of the United States coming to his port.\r\n\r\n[273] This name is derived from the large bay that makes in on\r\nthe south side of the island of Mindanao, and on which a set of\r\nfreebooters reside.\r\n\r\n[274] From the History of a Voyage of the China Sea, by John White.\r\n\r\n[275] P. 115.\r\n\r\n[276] Pp. 116-119.\r\n\r\n[277] P. 121.\r\n\r\n[278] Pp. 125-128.\r\n\r\n[279] Pp. 137-138.\r\n\r\n[280] Pp. 143-144.\r\n\r\n[281] Pp. 144-146.",
