The History of the Abolition\r\nwhich this volume contains, affords some means of appreciating the\r\nextent of his sacrifices and his labours in this cause. But after these,\r\nwith the unwearied exertions of William Wilberforce, had conducted its\r\nfriends to their final triumph, in 1807, they did not then rest from\r\ntheir labours. There remained four most important objects, to which the\r\nanxious attention of all Abolitionists was now directed.\r\n\r\n_First_,--The law had been passed, forced upon the Planters, the\r\nTraders, and the Parliament, by the voice of the people; and there was a\r\nnecessity for keeping a watchful eye over its execution.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_,--The statute, however rigorously it might be enforced, left,\r\nof course, the whole amount of the Foreign Slave traffic untouched, and\r\nit was infinitely to be desired that means should be adopted for\r\nextending our Abolition to other nations.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_,--Some compensation was due to Africa, for the countless\r\nmiseries which our criminal conduct had for ages inflicted upon her, and\r\nstrict justice, to say nothing of common humanity and Christian charity,\r\ndemanded that every means should be used for aiding in the progress of\r\nher civilization, and effacing as far as possible the dreadful marks\r\nwhich had been left upon her by our crimes.\r\n\r\n_Lastly,_--Many of those whom we had transported by fraud and violence\r\nfrom their native country, and still more of the descendants of others\r\nwho had fallen a sacrifice to our cruelties, and perished in the course\r\nof nature, slaves in a foreign land, remained to suffer the dreadful\r\nevils of West India bondage. It seemed to follow, that the earliest\r\nopportunity consistent with their own condition, should be taken to free\r\nthose unhappy beings, the victims of our sordid cruelty; and all the\r\nmore to be pitied, as we were all the more to be blamed, because one\r\nresult of our transgression was the having placed them in so unnatural a\r\nposition, that their enemies might seem to be furnished with an argument\r\nmore plausible than sound, drawn from the Negro's supposed unfitness for\r\nimmediate emancipation.\r\n\r\nIn order to promote these four great objects, a society was formed in\r\nMay 1807, called the African Institution, and although, at first, its\r\nlabours were chiefly directed to the portion of the subject relating to\r\nAfrica, by degrees, as the extinction of the British Slave Trade was\r\naccomplished, its care was chiefly bestowed on West India matters, which\r\nwere more within the power of this country than the slave traffic, still\r\ncarried on by foreign nations. But it is necessary in the first place,\r\nto recite the measures by which our own share in that enormous crime was\r\nsurrendered, and the stigma partially obliterated, which it had brought\r\nupon our national character, Thomas Clarkson bore a forward and\r\nimportant part in all these useful and virtuous proceedings. His health\r\nwas now, by rest among the Lakes of Westmoreland for several years,\r\ncomparatively restored and his mind once more bent itself to the\r\naccomplishment of the grand object; of his life, we may he permitted\r\nreverently to suggest, the end of his existence.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephen and others, at first, deemed the certainty of the Act passed\r\nin March 1807, being evaded under the stimulus, and the insurance\r\nagainst capture afforded by the enormous profits of the traffic, so\r\nclear, that they expected the law to become, almost from the time of its\r\nbeing enacted, a dead letter. There soon appeared the strongest reasons\r\nto concur in this opinion, the result of long and close observation in\r\nthe Islands where Mr. Stephen had passed part of his life. The\r\nslave-dealers knew the risk of penalty and forfeiture which they ran;\r\nbut they also knew that if one voyage in three or four was successful,\r\nthey were abundantly remunerated for all their losses; and, therefore,\r\nthey were no more restrained by the Abolition Act, than by any moderate\r\nincrease of the cost or the risk attending their wicked adventures. This\r\nwas sure, to be the case, as long as the law only treated slavetrading\r\nas a contraband commerce, subjecting those who drove it to nothing but\r\npecuniary penalties. But it was equally evident that the same persons\r\nwho made these calculations of profit and risk, while they only could\r\nlose the ship or the money by a seizure, would hesitate before they\r\nencountered the hazard of being tried as for a crime. And, surely, if\r\never these was an act which deserved to be declared felony, and dealt\r\nwith as such, it was this of slave-trading. Accordingly, in 1810, Mr.\r\nBrougham, then a member of the House of Commons, in moving an address to\r\nthe crown, (which was unanimously agreed to,) for more vigorous measures\r\nagainst the traffic, both British and Foreign, gave notice of the Bill,\r\nwhich he next year carried through Parliament, and which declared the\r\ntraffic to be a felony, punishable with transportation. Some years\r\nafterwards it was by another Act made capital, under the name of Piracy,\r\nbut this has since been repealed. Several convictions have taken place\r\nunder the former Act, (of 1811,) and there cannot be the least doubt\r\nthat the law has proved effectual, and that the Slave Trade has long\r\nceased to exist as far as the British dominions are concerned.\r\n\r\nThat foreign states continue shamefully to carry it on, is no less\r\ncertain. There are yearly transported to Cuba and Brazil, above 100,000\r\nunhappy beings, by the two weakest nations in Europe, and these two most\r\nentirely subject to the influence and even direct control of England.\r\nThe inevitable consequence is, that more misery is now inflicted on\r\nAfrica by the criminals, gently called Slave-traders, of these two\r\nguilty nations, than if there were no treaties for the abolition of the\r\ntraffic. The number required is always carried over, and hence, as many\r\nperish by a miserable death in escaping from the cruisers, as reach\r\ntheir destination. The recitals of horror which have been made to\r\nParliament and the country on this dreadful subject, are enough to\r\ncurdle the blood in the veins and heart of any one endued with the\r\ncommon feelings of humanity. The whole system of prevention, or rather\r\nof capture, after the crime has been committed, seems framed with a view\r\nto exasperate the evils of the infernal traffic, to scourge Africa with\r\nmore intolerable torments, and to make human blood be spilt like water.\r\nOur cruisers, are excited to an active discharge of their duty, by the\r\nbenefit of sharing in the price fetched when the captured ship is\r\ncondemned and sold; but this is a small sum, indeed, compared with the\r\nrich reward of head-money held out, being so much for every slave taken\r\non board. It is thus made the direct interest of these cruisers, that\r\nthe vessels should have their human cargoes on board, rather than be\r\nprevented from shipping them. True, this vile policy may prove less\r\nmischievous where no treaty exists, giving a right to seize when there\r\nare no slaves in the vessel, because here a slave ship is suffered to\r\npass, how clear soever her destination might be; yet, even here, the\r\ninducement to send in boats, and seize as soon as a slave or two may be\r\non board, is removed, and the cruiser is told, \"only let all these\r\nwretched beings be torn from their country, and safely lodged in the\r\nvessel's hold, and your reward is great and sure.\" Then, whenever there\r\nis an outfit clause, that is a power to seize vessels fitted for the\r\ntraffic, this mischievous plan tends directly to make the cruiser let\r\nthe slaver make ready and put to sea, or it has no tendency or meaning\r\nat all. Accordingly, the course is for the cruiser to stand out to sea,\r\nand not allow herself to be seen in the offing--the crime is\r\nconsummated--the slaves are stowed away--the pirate--captain weighs\r\nanchor--the pirate-vessel freighted with victims, and manned by\r\ncriminals fares forth--the cruiser, the British cruiser, gives\r\nchace--and then begin those scenes of horror, surpassing all that the\r\npoet ever conceived, whose theme was the torments of the damned and the\r\nwickedness of the fiends. Casks are filled with the slave, and in these\r\nthey are stowed away; or to lighten the vessel, they are flung overboard\r\nby the score; sometimes they are flung overboard in casks, that the\r\nchasing ship may be detained by endeavours to pick them up; the dying\r\nand the dead strew the deck; women giving birth to the fruit of the\r\nwomb, amidst the corpses of their husbands and their children; and\r\nother, yet worse and nameless atrocities, fill up the terrible picture,\r\nof impotent justice and triumphant guilt. But the guilt is not all\r\nSpanish and Portuguese. The English Government can enforce its demands\r\non the puny cabinets of Madrid and Lisbon, scarce conscious of a\r\nsubstantive existence, in all that concerns our petty interests:\r\nwherever justice and mercy to mankind demand our interference, there our\r\nvoice sinks within us, and no sound is uttered. That any treaty without\r\nan outfit clause should be suffered to exist between powers so situated,\r\nis an outrage upon all justice, all reason, all common sense. But one\r\nthing is certain, that unless we are to go further, we have gone too\r\nfar, and must in mercy to hapless Africa retrace our steps. Unless we\r\nreally put the traffic down with a strong hand, and instantly, we must\r\ninstantly repeal the treaties that pretended to abolish it, for these\r\nexacerbate the evil a hundred fold, and are ineffectual to any one\r\npurpose but putting money into the pockets of our men of war. The fact\r\nis as unquestionable, as it is appalling, that all our anxious\r\nendeavours to extinguish the Foreign Slave Trade, have ended in making\r\nit incomparably worse than it was before we pretended to put it down;\r\nthat owing to our efforts, there are thrice the number of slaves yearly\r\ntorn from Africa; and that wholly because of our efforts, two thirds of\r\nthese are murdered on the high seas and in the holds of the pirate\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that when these scenes were described to an indignant nation\r\nlast session of Parliament, the actual effects of this bad system were\r\ndenied, though its tendency could not be disputed.\r\n\r\nIt was averred that \"no British seaman could be capable of neglecting\r\nhis duty for the sake of increasing the gains of the station.\" But\r\nnothing could be more absurd than this. Can the direct and inevitable\r\ntendency of the head-money system be doubted? Are cruisers the only men\r\nover whom motives have no influence? Then why offer a reward at all?\r\nWhen they want no stimulus to perform their duty, why tell them that if\r\nthe ship is empty, they get a hundred pounds: if laden, five thousand?\r\nThey know the rules of arithmetic;--they understand the force of\r\nnumbers. But, in truth, there is not an individual on all the coast of\r\nAfrica who will be misled by such appeals, or suffer all this to divert\r\nthem from their purpose of denouncing the system. There are persons high\r\nin rank among the best servants of the crown, who know the facts from\r\ntheir own observations, and who are ready to bear witness to the truth,\r\nin spite of all the attempts that have been made to silence them.\r\n\r\nThe other great object of the African Institution regarded the West\r\nIndies. The preparation of the negroes for that freedom which was their\r\nabsolute right, and could only be withheld for an hour, on the ground of\r\ntheir not being prepared for it, and therefore being better without it,\r\nwas the first thing to be accomplished. Here the friends of the\r\nabolition, all but Mr. Stephen, suffered a great disappointment. He\r\nalone had uniformly-foretold that the hopes held out, as it seemed very\r\nreasonably, of better treatment resulting from the stoppage of the\r\nsupply of hands, were fallacious. All else had supposed that interest\r\nmight operate on men whom principle had failed to sway; that they whom\r\nno feelings of compassion for their fellow-creatures could move to do\r\ntheir duty, might be touched by a feeling of their own advantage, when\r\ninterest coincided with duty. The Slave-mart is now closed, it was said;\r\nsurely the stock on hand will be saved by all means, and not wasted when\r\nit can no longer be replaced. The argument was purposely rested on the\r\nlow ground of regarding human beings as cattle, or even as inanimate\r\nchattels, and it was conceived that human life would be regarded of as\r\nmuch value as the wear and tear of beasts, of furniture, or of tools.\r\nHence it was expected that a better system of treatment would follow,\r\nfrom the law which closed the African market, and warned every planter\r\nthat his stock must be spared by better treatment, and kept up by\r\nbreeding, since it no longer could be, as it hitherto had been,\r\nmaintained by new supplies.\r\n\r\nTwo considerations were, in these arguments, kept out of view, both of a\r\npractical nature, and both known to Mr. Stephen,--the cultivation of the\r\nIslands by agents having wholly different interests from their masters,\r\nand the gambling spirit of trading and culture which long habit had\r\nimplanted in the West Indian nature. The comforts of the slave depended\r\ninfinitely more upon the agent on the spot, than the owner generally\r\nresident in the mother country; and though the interest of the latter\r\nmight lead to the saving of negro life, and care for negro comforts, the\r\nagent had no such motives to influence his conduct; besides, it was with\r\nthe eyes of this agent that the planter must see, and he gave no\r\ncredence to any accounts but his. Now the consequence of cruelty is to\r\nmake men at war with its objects. No one but a most irritable person\r\nfeels angry with his beast, and even the anger of such a person is of a\r\nmoment's duration. But towards an inanimate chattel even the most\r\nirritable of sane men can feel nothing like rage. Why? Because in the\r\none case there is little, in the other no conflict or resistance at all.\r\nIt is otherwise with a slave; he is human, and can disobey--can even\r\nresist. This feeling always rankles in his oppressor's bosom, and makes\r\nthe tyrannical superior hate, and the more oppress his slave. The agent\r\non the spot feels thus, and thus acts; nor can the voice of the owner at\r\na distance be heard, even if interest, clearly proved, were to prompt\r\nanother course. But the chief cause of the evil is the spirit of\r\nspeculation, and it affects and rules resident owners even more than\r\nabsentees. Let sugar rise in price, and all cold calculations of\r\nultimate loss to the gang are lost in the vehement thirst of great\r\npresent gain. All, or nearly all, planters are in distressed\r\ncircumstances. They look to the next few years as their time; and if the\r\nsun shines they must make hay. They are in the mine, toiling for a\r\nseason, with every desire to escape and realize something to spend\r\nelsewhere. Therefore they make haste to be rich, and care little, should\r\nthe speculation answer and much sugar bring in great gain, what becomes\r\nof the gang ten years hence. Add to all this, that any interference of\r\nthe local legislatures to discourage sordid or cruel management, to\r\nclothe the slaves with rights, to prepare them for freedom by better\r\neducation, to pave the way for emancipation by restraining the master's\r\npower, to create an intermediate State of transition from slavery to\r\nfreedom by partial liberty, as by attaching them to the soil, and\r\nplacing them in the preparatory state through which our ancestors in\r\nEurope passed from bondage in gross to entire independence--all such\r\nmeasures were in the absolute discretion; not of the planters, but of\r\nthe resident agents, one of the worst communities in the world, who had\r\nlittle interest in preparing for an event which they deprecated, and\r\nwhose feelings of party, as well as individually, were all ranged on the\r\noppressor's side. All this Mr. Stephen, enlightened by experience, and\r\nwise by long reflection, clearly and alone foresaw; all this vision of\r\nthe future was too surely realized by the event. No improvement of\r\ntreatment took place; no additional liberality in the supplies was\r\nshown; no abstinence in the exaction of labour appeared; no interference\r\nof the Colonial Legislature to check misconduct was witnessed; far less\r\nwas the least disposition perceived to give any rights to the slaves,\r\nany security against oppression, any title independent of his Master,\r\nany intermediate state or condition which might prepare him for freedom.\r\nIt is enough to say, that a measure which every man, except Mr. Stephen,\r\nhad regarded as the natural, almost the necessary effect of the\r\nabolition--attaching the slaves to the soil--was not so much as\r\npropounded, far less adopted; it may be even said, was never mentioned\r\nin any one local assembly of any of our numerous colonies, during the\r\nthirty years which elapsed between the abolition and the emancipation!\r\nThis is unquestionable, and it is decisive.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it began to be perceived that such was likely to be the\r\nresult of the abolition in regard to the emancipation, Mr. Stephen's\r\nauthority with his coadjutors, always high, rose in proportion to the\r\nconfirmations which the event had lent his predictions; and his zealous\r\nendeavours and unwearied labours for the subversion of the accursed\r\nsystem became both more extensive and more effectual. If, however,\r\nstrict justice requires the tribute which we have paid to this eminent\r\nperson's distinguished services, justice also renders it imperative on\r\nthe historian of the Abolition in all its branches, to record an error\r\ninto which he fell. Having originally maintained that the traffic would\r\nsurvive the Act of 1807, in which he was right, that Act only imposing\r\npecuniary penalties, he persisted in the same opinion after the Act of\r\n1811 had made slave-trading a felony; and long after it had been\r\neffectually put down in the British dominions, he continued to maintain\r\nthat it was carried on nearly as much as ever, reasoning upon\r\ncalculations drawn from the island returns. Hence he insisted upon a\r\ngeneral Registry Act, as essential to prevent the continuance of an\r\nimportation which had little or no real existence. The importance of\r\nsuch a measure was undeniable, with a view to secure the good treatment\r\nof the negroes in the islands; but the extinction of the Slave Trade had\r\nlong before been effectually accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn the efforts to obtain Negro Emancipation, all the Abolitionists were\r\nnow prepared to join. The conduct of the Colonial Assemblies having long\r\nshown the fallacy of those expectations which had been entertained of\r\nthe good work being done in the islands as soon as the supply of new\r\nhands should be stopped by the Abolition, there remained no longer any\r\ndoubt whatever, that the mother country alone could abate a nuisance\r\nhateful in the sight of God and man. Constant opportunities were\r\ntherefore offered to agitate this great question, which was taken up by\r\nthe enlightened, the humane, and the religious, all over the empire.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the subject was indeed worthy of all the interest it\r\nexcited. The destiny of nearly a million of human beings--nay, the\r\nquestion whether they should be treated as men with rational souls, or\r\nas the beasts which perish--should enjoy the liberty to which all God's\r\ncreatures are entitled, as of right, or be harassed, oppressed,\r\ntormented, and stinted, both as regarded bodily food, and spiritual\r\ninstruction--whether the colonies should be peopled with tyrants and\r\nbarbarians, or inhabited by civilized and improving christian\r\ncommunities--was one calculated to put in action all the best principles\r\nof our nature, and to move all the noblest feelings of the human heart.\r\n\r\nThomas Clarkson, as far as his means extended, aided this great\r\nexcitement. He renewed his committees of correspondence all over the\r\ncountry; aided by the Society of Friends, his early and steady\r\ncoadjutors in this pious work, he recommenced the epistolary intercourse\r\nwith the provinces, held for so many hopeless years on the Slave Trade,\r\nbut now made far more promising by the victory which had been obtained,\r\nand by the unanimity with which all Abolitionists now were resolved to\r\nprocure emancipation. He also recommenced his journeys through the\r\ndifferent parts of the island, and visited in succession part of\r\nScotland, almost all England, and the whole of Wales, encouraging and\r\ninteresting the friends of humanity wherever he went, and forming local\r\nsocieties and committees for furthering the common object.\r\n\r\nBut it was, after all, in Parliament that the battle must be fought; and\r\nMr. Buxton, of whose invaluable services in the House of Commons the\r\ncause has lately been deprived, repeatedly, with the support of Messrs.\r\nWilberforce, William Smith, Brougham, Lushington, and others, urged the\r\nnecessity of interference upon the representatives of a people unanimous\r\nin demanding it; and he repeatedly urged it in vain. The Government\r\nalways leaned towards the planter, and the most flimsy excuses were\r\nconstantly given for preferring to the effectual measures propounded by\r\nthe Abolitionists, the most flimsy of expedients, useless for any one\r\npurpose, save that of making pretences and gaining time.\r\n\r\nAt length came the great case of the missionary Smith's persecution,\r\ntrial, and untimely death, when all the forms of judicature had been\r\nprostituted, all the rules of law broken, all the principles of justice\r\noutraged, by men assuming to sit in judgment as a court of criminal\r\njurisprudence; and though assisted by legal functionaries, exhibiting\r\nsuch a spectacle of daring violation of the most received and best known\r\ncanons of procedure, as no civilized community ever before were called\r\nupon to endure. This subject was immediately brought before Parliament\r\nby Mr. Brougham, and his motion of censure, which might have been an\r\nimpeachment of the governor and the court of Demerara, was powerfully\r\nsupported by Mr. Wilberforce, the amiable, eloquent, and venerable\r\nleader of the party, Mr. Denman, Mr. Williams, and Dr. Lushington, but\r\nrejected by a majority of the Commons, whom Mr. Canning led, in a speech\r\nlittle worthy of his former exertions against the Slave Trade, and far\r\nfrom being creditable either to his judgment or to his principles. Yet\r\nthis memorable debate was of singular service to the cause. The great\r\nspeeches delivered were spread through all parts of the country; the\r\nnakedness of the horrid system was exposed; the corruptions as well as\r\ncruelty of slavery were laid bare; the determination of colonies to\r\nprotect its worst abuses was demonstrated; necessity of the\r\nmother-country interfering with a strong hand was declared; and even the\r\nloss of the motion showed the people of England how much their own\r\nexertions were still required if they would see slavery extirpated, by\r\nproving that upon them alone the fate of the execrable system hung.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this great debate cannot be over estimated. The case of\r\nthe missionary became the universal topic; The name of the martyred\r\nSmith, the general rallying cry. The superior interest excited by\r\nindividual sufferings to any general misery inflicted upon masses of the\r\npeople, or any evil, however gigantic, which operates over a large\r\nspace, and in a course of time, has always been observed. The remark was\r\npeculiarly applicable in this instance. Although all reflecting men had,\r\nfor many long years, been well aware of the evils pervading our colonial\r\nsystem, and though the iniquity and perverseness of West Indian\r\njudicatures had long been the topic of universal comment, yet this\r\nsingle case of a persecuted individual falling a victim to those gross\r\nperversions of law and justice which are familiar to the colonial\r\npeople, produced an impression far more general and more deep than all\r\nthat had ever been written or declaimed against system of West India\r\nslavery; and looking back on the consummation of all our hopes in 1833\r\nand 1838, we at once revert from this auspicious era to that ever\r\nmemorable occasion as having laid the solid foundation of our ultimate\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nIn this important day, which has thus by its effects proved decisive of\r\nthe Emancipation question, Mr. Stephen bore no part. He had long ceased\r\nto adorn and enlighten the House of Commons. His retirement was the\r\nresult of honest differences of opinion respecting West India slavery\r\nwith his political friends, then in the plenitude of their power. Those\r\ndifferences caused him to take the noble part, so rarely acted by\r\npoliticians, of withdrawing from Parliament rather than lend his great\r\nsupport to men with whom he differed upon a question admitting no\r\ncompromise; and he devoted his exertions in private life to the\r\nfurtherance of the cause ever nearest his heart, the publication of his\r\nable and elaborate work on the Colonial Slave Laws was the fruit of his\r\nleisure; and had he never lent any other aid to the Emancipation, this\r\nwould alone have placed him high among its most able and effective\r\nsupporters. In all the consultations which were held before Mr.\r\nBrougham's motion in 1824, he bore an active and useful part. In pushing\r\nthe advantages gained by the debate he was unwearied and successful.\r\nUnhappily it pleased Providence that he should not receive here below\r\nthe final reward of his long and valued labours; for he was called to\r\nhis final repose some months before the Emancipation Bill passed into a\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThere remains little to add, except that this measure, which was carried\r\nwith little opposition in 1833, owed its success in Parliament to the\r\nample bribe of twenty millions, by which the acquiescence of the West\r\nIndians was purchased. The measure had hardly come into operation, when\r\nall men perceived that the intermediate state of apprenticeship was\r\nanything rather than a preparation for freedom, and anything rather than\r\na mitigation of slavery. It is due to some able and distinguished\r\nfriends of the negro race to state, that they all along were averse to\r\nthis plan of a transition state. Lord Howick, then in the Colonial\r\nOffice as Under-Secretary, went so far as to leave the department, from\r\nhis dislike of this part of the measure. Mr. Buxton and others protested\r\nagainst it. Even its friends intimated that they wished the period of\r\napprenticeship to end in 1838 instead of 1840; but there was a general\r\nbelief of the preparatory step being necessary,--a belief apparently\r\nfounded on experience of the negro character, and indeed of the vicious\r\ntendency of all slavery, to extinguish the power of voluntary labour, as\r\nwell as to make the sudden change to freedom unsafe for the peace of the\r\ncommunity. The fact soon dispersed these opinions. Antigua in a minute\r\nemancipated all her slaves to the number of thirty thousand and upwards.\r\nNot a complaint was ever heard of idleness or indolence; and, far from\r\nany breach of the peace being induced by the sudden change in the\r\ncondition of the people, the Christmas of 1833 was the first, for the\r\nlast twenty years, that martial law was not proclaimed, in order to\r\npreserve the public peace. Similar evidence from Jamaica and other\r\nislands, proving the industrious and peaceable habits of the\r\napprentices, showed that there was nothing peculiar in the circumstances\r\nof Antigua.\r\n\r\nAn important occurrence is now to be recorded as having exercised a\r\npowerful influence upon the question of immediate emancipation. Joseph\r\nSturge, of Birmingham, a member of the Society of Friends, stricken with\r\na sense of the injustice perpetrated against the African race, repaired\r\nto the West Indies, in order that he might examine, with his own eyes,\r\nthe real state of the question between the two classes. He was\r\naccompanied by John Scoble and Thomas Harvey; and these able, excellent,\r\nand zealous men returned in a few months with such ample evidence of the\r\neffects produced by apprenticeship, and the fitness of the negroes for\r\nliberty, that the attention of the community was soon awakened to the\r\nsubject, even more strenuously than it ever before had been; and the\r\nwalls of Parliament were soon made once more to ring with the sufferings\r\nof the slave, only emancipated in name, and the injustice of withholding\r\nfrom him any longer the freedom which was his indefeasible right, as\r\nsoon as he was shown capable of enjoying it beneficially for himself and\r\nsafely for the rest of the community.\r\n\r\nIn these transactions, both in Jamaica, where he is one of the largest\r\nplanters, and in Parliament, where he is one of the most respected\r\nmembers, the Marquess of Sligo bore an eminent and an honourable part.\r\nHis praise has been justly sounded by all who have supported the cause\r\nof negro freedom, and his conduct was by all admitted to be as much\r\nmarked by the disinterested virtue of a good citizen and amiable man, as\r\nit was by the sagacity and ability of an enlightened statesman. Both as\r\ngovernor of Jamaica, as the owner of slaves whom he voluntarily\r\nliberated, and as a peer of Parliament, his patriotism, his humanity,\r\nand his talents, shone conspicuously through this severe and glorious\r\nstruggle. While such was the conduct of those eminent philanthropists,\r\nsome difference of opinion prevailed among the other and older leaders\r\nof the cause, chiefly grounded upon doubts whether the arrangement made\r\nby Parliament in 1833, might not be regarded as a compact with the\r\nplanters which it would be unjust to violate by terminating their right\r\nto the labour of the apprentices at a period earlier than the one fixed\r\nin the Emancipation Act. A little consideration of the question at issue\r\nsoon dispelled those doubts, and removed every obstacle to united\r\nexertion, by restoring entire unanimity of opinion. The slaves, it was\r\ntriumphantly affirmed, were no party to the compact. But moreover, the\r\nwhole arrangement of the apprenticeship was intended as a benefit to\r\nthem, by giving them the preparation thought to be required before they\r\ncould, safely for themselves, be admitted to unrestricted freedom,--not\r\nas a benefit to the planters, whose acquiescence was purchased with the\r\ngrant of twenty millions. Experience having shown that no preparation at\r\nall was required, it was preposterous to continue the restraint upon\r\nnatural liberty an hour longer, as regarded the negroes,--the only party\r\nwhom we had any right to consider in the question; and as for the\r\nplanters there was the grossest absurdity in further regarding any\r\ninterests or any claims of theirs. The arrangement of 1833, as far as\r\nregards the transition or intermediate state, had been made under an\r\nerror in fact, an error propagated by the representations of the\r\nmasters. That error was now at an end, and an immediate alteration of\r\nthe provisions to which it had given rise was thus a matter of strict\r\njustice;--not to mention that the planters had failed to perform their\r\npart of the contract. The Colonial Assemblies had, except in Antigua,\r\ndone nothing for the slave in return for the large sum bestowed upon the\r\nWest India body. So that in any view there was an end of all pretext for\r\nthe further delay of right and justice.\r\n\r\nThe ground now taken by the whole Abolitionists; therefore, both in and\r\nout of Parliament was, that the two years which remained of the\r\nindentured apprenticeship must immediately be cut off, and freedom given\r\nto the slaves in August, 1838, instead of 1840; The peace of the West\r\nIndian community, and the real interests of the planters, were affirmed\r\nto be as much concerned in this change as the rights of the negroes\r\nthemselves. Far from preparing them for becoming peaceable subjects and\r\ncontented members of society at the end of their apprenticeship, those\r\ntwo years of compulsory labour would, it was justly observed, be a\r\nperiod of heart-burning and discontent between master and servant, which\r\nmust, in the mean while, be dangerous to the peace of society, and must\r\nleave, at the end of the time, a feeling of mutual ill-will and\r\ndistrust. The question could no longer be kept from the cognizance of\r\nthe negro people. Indeed, their most anxious expectations were already\r\npointed towards immediate liberty, and their strongest feelings were\r\nroused to obtain it.\r\n\r\nOf these sentiments the whole community partook; meetings were\r\neverywhere held; petitions crowded the tables of Parliament; the press\r\npoured forth innumerable tracts which were eagerly received; the pulpit\r\nlent its aid to this holy cause; and discussions upon petitions and upon\r\nincidental motions shook the walls of Parliament, while they stimulated\r\nthe zeal of the people. The Government adopted an unfortunate course,\r\nwhich contributed greatly to weaken their hold on the confidence and\r\naffections of the country; they resisted all the motions that were made\r\non behalf of the slaves, and appeared to regard only the interests of\r\nthe master, turning a deaf ear to the arguments of right and of justice.\r\n\r\nIt was found, during the course of these debates, that a new Slave Trade\r\nhad sprung up in the East Indies, with the sanction of an English Order\r\nin Council. Under pretence that hands were wanted to cultivate their\r\nestates, the Demerara planters had obtained permission to import what\r\nthey termed, with a delicacy borrowed from the vocabulary of the African\r\nSlave Trade, \"labourers\" from Asia and from Africa east of the Cape, and\r\nto make them Indentured Apprentices for a term of years. No restrictions\r\nwhatever were imposed by this unheard-of Order. No tonnage was required\r\nin proportion to the numbers shipped, no amount of provision, no medical\r\nassistance; no precautions were taken, or so much as thought of, to\r\nprevent kidnapping and fraud, nay, to prevent main force being used in\r\nany part of Eastern Africa, or of all Asia, in carrying on board the\r\nvictims of West Indian avarice; in short, a worse Slave Trade than the\r\nAfrican was established, and all the dominions of the East India\r\nCompany, with all the African and Asiatic coasts, as yet independent,\r\nwere given over to its ravages. This was repeatedly denounced by Lord\r\nBrougham in the House of Lords; and although his motion for rescinding\r\nthe order was supported by Lord Lyndhurst, Lord Ellenborough, and Lord\r\nWharncliffe, the influence of the Government and the planters prevailed,\r\nand the House rejected it. A bill was afterwards brought in to check the\r\nenormities complained of; but no remedy at all effectual is as yet\r\napplied. The official documents, however, proved that already men had\r\nbeen inveigled on board, by the agents of the Mauritius planters, in\r\ndifferent parts of the East, and that the mortality on that\r\ncomparatively short voyage exceeded even the dreadful waste of life\r\nwhich had characterized, and impressed with marks of horrid atrocity,\r\nthe accursed Middle Passage.\r\n\r\nThis subject, as might well be expected, once more roused the energies\r\nof Thomas Clarkson: he addressed an able and convincing letter to Lord\r\nBrougham, his old friend and coadjutor in the sacred cause; and it was\r\nprinted and universally circulated. The subject still remains unsettled:\r\nand the labours of the enlightened philanthropist cannot now be directed\r\nto one more important, or more urgent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the spring of 1838, the question of Immediate Emancipation\r\nwas agitated throughout the country. The Government proved hostile.\r\nImmense meetings were held at Exeter Hall, which were attended by many\r\nmembers of Parliament, over which Lord Brougham presided. Among others\r\nwho were present and bore a distinguished part, were certain\r\nrepresentatives of Ireland who promised their strenuous support. It is a\r\npainful duty to add, that their fellow-members from Ireland did not, on\r\nthis great occasion, follow their good example; for eleven only of\r\nthose, on whose votes reliance had been placed, opposed the Government,\r\nwhile no less than twenty-seven gave them support.\r\n\r\nThe question was rejected by the House of Lords, when brought forward by\r\nLord Brougham; but in spite of the efforts of the Government; the\r\ndefalcation of the Irish, of a still greater proportion of the Scotch\r\nrepresentatives, two hundred and seventeen members of the House of\r\nCommons voted for Immediate Abolition, out of four hundred and\r\neighty-nine who were present on the occasion. A second effort in the\r\nsame session placed Ministers in a minority; but they immediately gave\r\nnotice, they should strenuously oppose any attempt to carry into\r\npractical effect this decision of the House; and in this determination\r\nthey were supported by a majority on a third division.\r\n\r\nThe word, however, had gone forth all over England, that the _Slave\r\nshould be free_. It had not only pervaded Europe, it had reached\r\nAmerica; and the West Indians at length perceived that they could no\r\nlonger resist the voice of the British people, when it spoke the accents\r\nof humanity and of justice. The slaves would have met the dawn of the\r\nfirst of August,--the day which all the motions in Parliament and all\r\nthe prayers of the petitions had fixed,--with perfect quiet, but with a\r\nresolute determination to do no work. The peace would not have been\r\nbroken, but no more would a clod have been turned after that appointed\r\nsun had risen. A handful of whites surrounded by myriads of\r\nnegroes,--now substantially free, and free without a blow,--must have\r\nbeen overwhelmed in an hour after sunrise on that day, had they\r\nresisted. The Colonial Legislatures, therefore, _now_ listened to the\r\nvoice of reason, and they, one after another, emancipated their slaves.\r\nThe first of August saw not a bondsman, under whatever appellation, in\r\nany part of the Western Sea which owns the British rule.\r\n\r\nThe Mauritius, however, still held out, and on the Mauritius the hand of\r\nthe Imperial Parliament must and will be laid, to enforce mercy and\r\njustice on those to whom mercy and justice have so long called aloud in\r\nvain. In truth, if the case for instant emancipation was strong\r\neverywhere, it was in no quarter half so strong as in the Mauritius; and\r\nthe distribution of the grant by Parliament to this Colony was the most\r\nunjustifiable, and even incomprehensible. For, elsewhere, there existed\r\nat least a title to the slave, over whom an unjust and unchristian law\r\nrecognised the right of property. But in the Mauritius there was not,\r\nnor is there now, one negro to whom a good title is clearly provable.\r\nThe atrocious conduct of Governors and other functionaries, in conniving\r\nat the Slave Trade of Eastern Africa, had filled that Colony with\r\nthousands of negroes, every one of whom was carried there by the\r\ncommission of felony, long after Slave Trading had been declared a\r\ncapital crime by the law of the land, as by the law of nature it always\r\nwas. Sir George Murray, when Colonial Secretary of State, had admitted,\r\nthat at least thirty thousand of the negroes in the settlement were\r\nnominally slaves, but in reality free, having been carried thither\r\ncontrary to law. He understated it by twenty thousand or more: yet on\r\nall these negroes, in respect of property, were two millions and more\r\nclaimed: for all these the compensation money was given and taken, which\r\nParliament had lavishly bestowed. How then was it possible to doubt,\r\nthat every slave in the Mauritius should receive his freedom, when the\r\nonly ground alleged for not singling out and liberating this fifty\r\nthousand, was the inability to distinguish them from the rest? If ten\r\nmen are tried for an offence, and it is clear that five are innocent,\r\nthough you cannot distinguish them from their companions, what jury will\r\nhesitate in acquitting the whole, on the ordinary principle of its being\r\nbetter five guilty should escape than five guiltless suffer? The same is\r\nstill the state of the case in that most criminal settlement, which,\r\nhaving far surpassed all others in the enormity of its guilt, is now the\r\nonly one where no attempt has been made to evince repentance by\r\namendment of conduct. But the Government which has the power of\r\ncompelling justice will share the crime which they refuse to prevent,\r\nand the Legislature must compel the Government, if their guilty\r\nreluctance shall continue, or it will take that guilt upon itself[A].\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It is truly gratifying to state, that the late Secretary\r\nfor the Colonies, Lord Glenelg, has, since this was written, given the\r\nmost satisfactory assurances of orders having been sent over for\r\nimmediate emancipation, in case the former instructions to the Governor\r\nof Mauritius should have failed, to make the Colonists themselves adopt\r\nthe measure. Lord Glenelg's conduct on this occasion is most creditable\r\nto him.]\r\n\r\nThe latest act of Thomas Clarkson's life has been one which, or rather\r\nthe occasion for which, it is truly painful to contemplate; but this too\r\nmust be recorded, or the present historical sketch would be incomplete.\r\nHe whose days had all been spent in acts of kindness and of justice to\r\nothers, was at last forced to exert his powers, supposed, by some, and\r\nerroneously supposed, to be enfeebled by age, in obtaining redress for\r\nhis own wrongs. He whose thoughts had all been devoted to the service of\r\nhis fellow-creatures, was now obliged to think of himself. A life spent\r\nin works of genuine philanthropy, alike standing aloof from party, and\r\nretiring with genuine humility from the public gaze, might have well\r\nhoped to escape that detraction, which is the lot of those who assume\r\nthe leading stations among their contemporaries, and mingle in the\r\ncontentious scenes of worldly affairs. Or, at least, it might have been\r\nexpected that his traducers would only be found among the oppressors of\r\nthe New World, or the slave-traders of the Old. This felicity has not\r\nbeen his lot; and the evening of his days has been overcast by an\r\nassault upon his character, proceeding from the quarter of all others\r\nthe most unexpected and the most strange.\r\n\r\nThe sons of his old and dear friend William Wilberforce,--whose\r\nincomparable merits he had ever been the first to acknowledge, whom he\r\nloved as a brother, and revered as the great leader of the cause to\r\nwhich his whole life had been devoted,--in publishing a Life of their\r\nillustrious parent, thought fit to charge Thomas Clarkson with having\r\nsuppressed his services while he exaggerated his own; and not content\r\nwith bringing a charge utterly groundless, (as it was instantly proved,)\r\nthey deemed it worthy of their subject and of their name, to drag forth\r\ninto the light of day a private correspondence of a delicate nature,\r\nwith the purpose of proving that their father and others had assisted\r\nhim with money, and that he had been pressing in his demands of a\r\nsubscription. Two extracts of Letters of his were printed by these\r\nreverend gentlemen, upon which a statement was afterwards grounded in\r\nthe _Edinburgh Review_ of their book, that the subscription was raised\r\nto remunerate him for his services in the Abolition. They further\r\nasserted, that their father was in the field before him, and that it was\r\nunder their father's direction that he, and the Abolition Committee of\r\n1786, acted. In the whole history of controversy, we venture to affirm,\r\nthere never was an instance of so triumphant a refutation as that by\r\nwhich these slanderous aspersions were instantly refuted, and their\r\nauthors and their accomplices reduced to a silence as prudent as\r\ndiscreditable.\r\n\r\nThe venerable philanthropist took up his pen, worn down in the cause of\r\nhumanity and of justice. _First_, he showed, by incontrovertible\r\nevidence, the utter falsehood of the charge, that he had underrated the\r\nmerits of others and exalted his own. These proofs were the references\r\nto his volumes themselves, which it really seemed as if the two reverend\r\nauthors had never even looked into. He then proved to demonstration that\r\nhe had taken the field earlier than William Wilberforce. This was shown,\r\nfirst, by known dates, matter of history; next, by letters from the\r\nfriends of both parties, as Archdeacon Corbet and William Smith; but,\r\nlastly, by the words of William Wilberforce himself, as well privately\r\nas at public meetings, asserting that he (William Wilberforce) came into\r\nthe field after his valued friend. But a striking fact may be cited, as\r\na sample at once of the course pursued by the assailants, and the\r\ncompleteness of the defence. The reverend authors in proof of their\r\nunqualified assertion, that Thomas Clarkson and the Committee acted from\r\nthe first under William Wilberforce's directions, refer to \"MS. Minutes\r\nof the Committee\" for their authority. But the friend who so ably\r\nsuperintended the publication of Thomas Clarkson's defence, and who\r\nadded to that tract an appendix of singular merit and great interest\r\n(H.C. Robinson), showed that the parts referred to by the reverend\r\nauthors, in proof of their assertion, completely disproved it; and that\r\nsix months after the Committee had been working, William Wilberforce\r\napplied to them for any information of which they might be possessed on\r\nthe subject of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nBut the publication of the letters and the colour given to the\r\ntransaction were far worse. The preservation of that correspondence, at\r\nall, by the sons, could only be justified by the belief of its being\r\naccidentally kept by the father, but, of course, never intended to be\r\nmade public; least of all without the usual precaution of asking the\r\nwriter's leave, and giving him the opportunity of explaining it. The\r\nbiographers printed it without any kind of communication with him, and\r\nhe saw it for the first time in print.\r\n\r\nThen, the attempt was made to represent this pure, and valuable, and\r\ndisinterested man as a mendicant philanthropist, who, for his exertions\r\nin the cause of justice, stooped to the humiliating attitude of\r\ncollecting a remuneration from his friends. The words of William\r\nWilberforce, and other Abolition leaders, prove that he had expended a\r\nvery considerable portion of his own small patrimony in the cause, and\r\nthat the subscription was to pay a debt,--a just and lawful debt; not to\r\nconfer a bounty, or reward, or remuneration for services performed. It\r\nis also proved, that after being reimbursed to the amount of the sum\r\ncontributed, or rather levied on those for whom the poorest of their\r\nbody had advanced his own money, he remained out of pocket far more than\r\nothers had ever given, after their share of the repayment was credited\r\nto them, in this debtor and creditor account.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all: Mr. Wilberforce himself, then a man of ample\r\nfortune, and Member for Yorkshire, had in 1807, published a pamphlet in\r\nthe cause. The Minutes of the Committee for 6th June, 1811, contained an\r\nentry of an order to pay 83_l_. out of the subscription funds to Mr.\r\nCadell, being Mr. Wilberforce's share of the loss sustained by that\r\npublication. There had been no mention at all of this in his life, by\r\nthese reverend authors, who scrupled not to print the garbled letters,\r\nwith the manifest design of lowering the character of their father's\r\nfriend, by ranking him among venal stipendiary pretenders to\r\nphilanthropy, and jobbing mendicant patriots.\r\n\r\nWherefore, it may be asked, was this matter at all dragged forth to\r\nlight, except to effect that unworthy purpose, and to give pain to a man\r\nas eminently as deservedly respected and beloved? The false pretext is,\r\nthe vindication of their father's memory.--But it had never been\r\nattacked. They affect to suppose such an attack, that they may have a\r\npretext for inflicting a wound in a fictitious and almost a fraudulent\r\ndefence.--But if it had been ever so rudely attacked, the letters are no\r\ndefence. For the only possible pretence of attack was the notion of\r\nThomas Clarkson having assumed the priority, and these letters can have\r\nno earthly relation to that point. Whether Wilberforce, or Clarkson, or\r\nneither of them, first began the abolition struggle, is a question as\r\nutterly wide of the subscription as any one private matter in the life\r\nof either party can be of any one public transaction in which both were\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nThe indignation of mankind was awakened by this disgraceful proceeding,\r\nand it was in vain that the friends of the Wilberforces urged, as some\r\nextenuation of their offence, the zeal which they naturally cherished\r\nfor the memory of their parent. Men of reflection felt that no\r\nwell-regulated mind can ever engage in slandering one person for the\r\npurpose of elevating another. Men of ordinary discernment perceived that\r\nthe assaults on Clarkson's reputation had no possible tendency to raise\r\nWilberforce's reputation. Men of observation saw at once that there\r\nlurked behind the wish to praise the one party, a desire to wound the\r\nother; and gave them far less credit for over-anxiety to gratify their\r\nfilial affections than eagerness to indulge their hostile feelings. It\r\nwas plain, too, that they sought this gratification at the hazard of\r\nbringing a stain upon the memory of their father; for what could be more\r\nnatural than the suspicion that they had obtained from him the materials\r\nout of which their web of detraction was woven? And what more\r\ndiscreditable to the author of the affectionate and familiar letters of\r\nWilberforce to Clarkson than their discrepancy with the charges now\r\nurged against him? It is due to the memory of this venerable man, now\r\ngone to his rest, to say that no one who knew him, ever so slightly,\r\ncould believe in the possibility of his holding one language to his\r\nfriend and another to his children: far less of his bequeathing to them\r\nanything like materials for the attack upon one to whom he professed the\r\nmost warm and steady attachment. But if such be the conclusion of all\r\nwho knew the man, assuredly in arriving at it they have derived no help\r\nfrom the lights afforded by his family.\r\n\r\nThe vindication of Thomas Clarkson has been triumphant; the punishment\r\nof his traducers has been exemplary. His character stands higher than\r\never; his name is lofty and it is unsullied; they have a character to\r\nretrieve,--a name which they have tarnished since it descended upon\r\nthem, they have to restore by their own future deserts.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the world was at its pitch when the champion of\r\nAbolition, the steady ally of Thomas Clarkson and Granville Sharpe, the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, was seen attempting to rescue these parties, and\r\ntaking part against the injured man, the patriarch of a cause defended\r\nby that celebrated Journal during a brilliant period of much above\r\nthirty years. The boldness displayed in its pages on this occasion was\r\nexcessive. As if feeling that the weak and indefensible part in the\r\nassault was the publishing of the letters, it had the confidence to\r\naffirm, that this proceeding was called for in justice to Wilberforce's\r\nmemory. So daring an attempt upon the integrity of facts has not often\r\nbeen witnessed. What! The publication of these letters, which had no\r\npossible connexion with Wilberforce's character, (a character, indeed,\r\nthat no one had assailed,) letters which were absolutely foreign even to\r\nthe question of priority in the abolition cause,--the publication of\r\nthese necessary to the defence of Wilberforce? Then, upon what ground\r\nnecessary? How had he been attacked? Where was he to be defended? But,\r\nif attacked, how did the letters aid,--how connect themselves\r\nwith,--how, in any manner of way, bear upon the defence, or any defence,\r\nor any portion of Wilberforce's character and life? They showed him to\r\nhave contributed towards the payment of a debt he had contracted to\r\nClarkson. But who had ever charged him with refusing to pay his debts?\r\nWith his merits as to the Abolition, (if that be what is meant by his\r\ncharacter,)--merits which it was a mere fabrication to pretend that\r\nClarkson had ever been slow to acknowledge,--those letters had\r\nabsolutely no possible connexion; and whoever, on this score, affects to\r\ndefend this publication, is capable of vindicating the printing any\r\nprivate letter upon the most delicate subject, by any man who writes the\r\nhistory of any other affair, or who writes on any subject from which the\r\ncorrespondence is wholly foreign. It is proper to add, that the editors\r\nof this Journal have most properly published a retractation of the\r\ncharges made, in their ignorance of the whole facts of the case.\r\n\r\nThe acute and sagacious editor of T. Clarkson's vindication, has given\r\nhis reasons for suspecting that this criticism, in the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_, must have proceeded from some party directly concerned in the\r\npublication of Wilberforce's life. We enter into no discussion of the\r\ncircumstantial evidence adduced in favour of this supposition. The\r\neditors of the Journal are the parties to whom we look; and as they,\r\nafter being to all appearance misled by some partial writer, have made\r\nthe best reparation for an involuntary error, by doing justice to the\r\ninjured party, we can have no further remark to make upon the subject.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to close these pages without mentioning the\r\nextraordinary merit of this latest, and, in all likelihood, this last\r\nproduction of Clarkson's pen. It is indeed a most able performance, and\r\nhas been admired by some of the ablest controversial writers of the age,\r\nas a model of excellence in controversial writing. Plain, vigorous,\r\nconvincing, perfectly calm and temperate, devoid of all acrimony, barely\r\nsaying enough to repel unjust aggression without one word of\r\nretaliation, never losing sight for a moment of its purely defensive\r\nobject, and accordingly, from the singleness of purpose with which that\r\nobject is pursued, attaining it with the most triumphant success,--no\r\nwonder that the public judgment has been loudly and universally\r\npronounced in its favour, that its adversaries have been reduced to\r\nabsolute silence, that its author's name has been exalted even higher\r\nthan before it stood. But the wonder is to see such unimpaired vigour at\r\nfour-score years of age, after a life of unwearied labour, latterly\r\nclouded by domestic calamity, and a spirit as young as ever in zeal for\r\njustice, tempered only by the mellowness which the kindly heart spreads\r\nover the fruits of the manly understanding.\r\n\r\nThere wanted no testimonials of esteem from his country to consummate\r\nthe venerable philanthropist's renown; yet these too have been added.\r\nVarious meetings have addressed their gratulations to him. Of these the\r\ngreat corporation of London claims the first regard, and after\r\npresenting him with the freedom of the city, they have ordered to be\r\nerected in their hall, as a memorial of his extraordinary virtue, a\r\nlikeness of the mortal form of Thomas Clarkson.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nNo subject more pleasing than that of the removal of evils.--Evils\r\nhave existed almost from the beginning of the world; but there is a\r\npower in our nature to counteract them--this power increased by\r\nChristianity.--Of the evils removed by Christianity one of the\r\ngreatest is the Slave Trade.--The joy we ought to feel on its\r\nabolition from a contemplation of the nature of it; and of the extent\r\nof it; and of the difficulty of subduing it.--Usefulness also of the\r\ncontemplation of this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nI scarcely know of any subject, the contemplation of which is more\r\npleasing, than that of the correction or of the removal of any of the\r\nacknowledged evils of life; for while we rejoice to think that the\r\nsufferings of our fellow-creatures have been thus, in any instance,\r\nrelieved, we must rejoice equally to think, that our own moral condition\r\nmust have been necessarily improved by the change.\r\n\r\nThat evils, both physical and moral, have existed long upon earth there\r\ncan be no doubt. One of the sacred writers, to whom we more immediately\r\nappeal for the early history of mankind, informs us that the state of\r\nour first parents was a state of innocence and happiness; but that, soon\r\nafter their creation, sin and misery entered into the world. The poets\r\nin their fables, most of which, however extravagant they may seem, had\r\ntheir origin in truth, speak the same language. Some of these represent\r\nthe first condition of man by the figure of the golden, and his\r\nsubsequent degeneracy and subjection to suffering by that of the silver,\r\nand afterwards of the iron age. Others tell us that the first female was\r\nmade of clay; that she was called Pandora, because every necessary gift,\r\nqualification, or endowment, was given to her by the gods, but that she\r\nreceived from Jupiter, at the same time, a box from which, when opened,\r\na multitude of disorders sprung, and that these spread themselves\r\nimmediately afterwards among all of the human race. Thus it appears,\r\nwhatever authorities we consult, that those which may be termed the\r\nevils of life existed in the earliest times. And what does subsequent\r\nhistory, combined with our own experience, tell us, but that these have\r\nbeen continued, or that they have come down in different degrees through\r\nsuccessive generations of men, in all the known countries of the\r\nuniverse, to the present day?\r\n\r\nBut though the inequality visible in the different conditions of life,\r\nand the passions interwoven into our nature, (both which have been\r\nallotted to us for wise purposes, and without which we could not easily\r\nafford a proof of the existence of that, which is denominated virtue,)\r\nhave a tendency to produce vice and wretchedness among us, yet we see,\r\nin this our constitution, what may operate partially as preventives and\r\ncorrective of them. If there be a radical propensity in our nature to do\r\nthat which is wrong, there is, on the other hand, a counteracting power\r\nwithin it, or an impulse by means of the action of the divine Spirit\r\nupon our minds, which urges us to do that which is right. If the voice\r\nof temptation, clothed in musical and seducing accents, charms us one\r\nway, the voice of holiness, speaking to us from within, in a solemn and\r\npowerful manner, commands us another. Does one man obtain a victory over\r\nhis corrupt affections? an immediate perception of pleasure, like the\r\nfeeling of a reward divinely conferred upon him, is noticed. Does\r\nanother fall prostrate beneath their power? a painful feeling, and such\r\nas pronounces to him the sentence of reproof and punishment is found to\r\nfollow. If one, by suffering his heart to become hardened, oppresses a\r\nfellow-creature, the tear of sympathy starts up in the eye of another,\r\nand the latter instantly feels a desire, involuntarily generated, of\r\nflying to his relief. Thus impulses, feelings, and dispositions have\r\nbeen implanted in our nature, for the purpose of preventing and\r\nrectifying the evils of life. And as these have operated, so as to\r\nstimulate some men to lessen them by the exercise of an amiable charity,\r\nso they have operated to stimulate others in various other ways to the\r\nsame end. Hence the philosopher has left moral precepts behind him in\r\nfavour of benevolence, and the legislator has endeavoured to prevent\r\nbarbarous practices by the introduction of laws.\r\n\r\nIn consequence then of these impulses and feelings, by which the pure\r\npower in our nature is thus made to act as a check upon the evil part of\r\nit, and in consequence of the influence which philosophy and legislative\r\nwisdom have had in their respective provinces, there has been always, in\r\nall times and countries, a counteracting energy, which has opposed\r\nitself, more or less, to the crimes and miseries of mankind. But it\r\nseems to have been reserved for Christianity to increase this energy,\r\nand to give it the widest possible domain. It was reserved for her,\r\nunder the same divine influence, to give the best views of the nature\r\nand of the present and future condition of man; to afford the best moral\r\nprecepts, to communicate the most benign stimulus to the heart, to\r\nproduce the most blameless conduct, and thus to cut off many of the\r\ncauses of wretchedness, and to heal it wherever it was found. At her\r\ncommand, wherever she has been duly acknowledged, many of the evils of\r\nlife have already fled. The prisoner of war is no longer led into the\r\namphitheatre to become a gladiator, and to imbrue his hands in the blood\r\nof his fellow-captive for the sport of a thoughtless multitude. The\r\nstern priest, cruel through fanaticism and custom, no longer leads his\r\nfellow-creature to the altar to sacrifice him to fictitious gods. The\r\nvenerable martyr, courageous through faith and the sanctity of his life,\r\nis no longer hurried to the flames. The haggard witch, poring over her\r\nincantations by moon-light, no longer scatters her superstitious poison\r\namong her miserable neighbours, nor suffers for her crime.\r\n\r\nBut in whatever way Christianity may have operated towards the increase\r\nof this energy, or towards a diminution of human misery, it has operated\r\nin none more powerfully than by the new views and consequent duties,\r\nwhich it introduced on the subject of charity, or practical benevolence\r\nand love. Men in ancient times looked upon their talents, of whatever\r\ndescription, as, their own, which they might use, or cease to use at\r\ntheir discretion. But the Author of our religion was the first who\r\ntaught that, however in a legal point of view, the talent of individuals\r\nmight belong exclusively to themselves, so that no other person had a\r\nright to demand the use of it by force, yet in the Christian\r\ndispensation they were but the stewards of it for good; that so much was\r\nexpected from this stewardship, that it was difficult for those who were\r\nintrusted with it to enter into his spiritual kingdom; that these had no\r\nright to conceal their talent in a napkin, but that they were bound to\r\ndispense a portion of it to the relief of their fellow-creatures; and\r\nthat, in proportion to the magnitude of it, they were accountable for\r\nthe extensiveness of its use. He was the first who pronounced the\r\nmisapplication of it to be a crime, and to be a crime of no ordinary\r\ndimensions. He was the first who broke down the boundary between Jew and\r\nGentile, and, therefore, the first who pointed out to men the\r\ninhabitants of other countries, for the exercise of their philanthropy\r\nand love. Hence a distinction is to be made both in the principle and\r\npractice of charity, as existing in ancient or in modern times. Though\r\nthe old philosophers, historians, and poets, frequently inculcated\r\nbenevolence, we have no reason to conclude from any facts they have left\r\nus, that persons in their days did anything more than occasionally\r\nrelieve an unfortunate object, who might present himself before them, or\r\nthat, however they might deplore the existence of public evils among\r\nthem, they joined in associations for their suppression, or that they\r\ncarried their charity, as bodies of men, into other kingdoms. To\r\nChristianity alone we are indebted for the new and sublime spectacle, of\r\nseeing men going beyond the bounds of individual usefulness to each\r\nother; of seeing them associate for the extirpation of private and\r\npublic misery; and of seeing them carry their charity, as a united\r\nbrotherhood, into distant lands. And in this wider field of benevolence\r\nit would be unjust not to confess, that no country has shone with more\r\ntrue lustre than our own, there being scarcely any case of acknowledged\r\naffliction, for which some of her Christian children have not united in\r\nan attempt to provide relief.\r\n\r\nAmong the evils corrected or subdued, either by the general influence of\r\nChristianity on the minds of men, or by particular associations of\r\nChristians, the African[A]. Slave Trade appears to me to have occupied\r\nthe foremost place. The abolition of it, therefore, of which it has\r\ndevolved upon me to write the history, should be accounted as one of the\r\ngreatest blessings, and as such should be one of the most copious\r\nsources of our joy: indeed, I know of no evil, the removal of which\r\nshould excite in us a higher degree of pleasure. For, in considerations\r\nof this kind, are we not usually influenced by circumstances? Are not\r\nour feelings usually affected according to the situation, or the\r\nmagnitude, or the importance of these? Are they not more or less\r\nelevated, as the evil under our contemplation has been more or less\r\nproductive of misery, or more or less productive of guilt? Are they not\r\nmore or less elevated again, as we have found it more or less\r\nconsiderable in extent? Our sensations will undoubtedly be in proportion\r\nto such circumstances, or our joy to the appreciation or mensuration of\r\nthe evil which has been removed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Slavery had been before annihilated by Christianity; I mean\r\nin the West of Europe, at the close of the twelfth century]\r\n\r\nTo value the blessing of the abolition as we ought, or to appreciate the\r\njoy and gratitude which we ought to feel concerning it, we must enter a\r\nlittle into the circumstances of the trade. Our statement, however, of\r\nthese needs not be long: a few pages will do all that is necessary! A\r\nglance only into such a subject as this will be sufficient to affect the\r\nheart,--to arouse our indignation and our pity,--and to teach us the\r\nimportance of the victory obtained.\r\n\r\nThe first subject for consideration, towards enabling us to make the\r\nestimate in question, will be that of the nature of the evil belonging\r\nto the Slave Trade. This may be seen by examining it in three points of\r\nview. First, as it has been proved to arise on the Continent of Africa,\r\nin the course of reducing the inhabitants of it to slavery. Secondly, in\r\nthe course of conveying them from thence to the lands or colonies of\r\nother nations. And, thirdly, in continuing them there as slaves.\r\n\r\nTo see it, as it has been shown, to arise in the first case, let us\r\nsuppose ourselves on the Continent just mentioned. Well then, We are\r\nlanded,--We are already upon our travels,--We have just passed through\r\none forest,--We are now come to a more open place, which indicates an\r\napproach to habitation. And what object is that which first obtrudes\r\nitself upon our sight? Who is that wretched woman whom we discover under\r\nthat noble tree, wringing her hands, and beating her breast, as if in\r\nthe agonies of despair? Three days has she been there, at intervals, to\r\nlook and to watch; and this is the fourth morning, and no tidings of her\r\nchildren yet. Beneath its spreading boughs they were accustomed to play:\r\nbut, alas! the savage man-stealer interrupted their playful mirth, and\r\nhas taken them for ever from her sight.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave the cries of this unfortunate woman, and hasten into\r\nanother district. And what do we first see here? Who is he that just now\r\nstarted across the narrow pathway, as if afraid of a human face? What is\r\nthat sudden rustling among the leaves? Why are those persons flying from\r\nour approach, and hiding themselves in yon darkest thicket? Behold, as\r\nwe get into the plain, a deserted village! The rice-field has been just\r\ntrodden down around it; an aged man,--venerable by his silver\r\nbeard,--lies wounded and dying near the threshold of his hut. War,\r\nsuddenly instigated by avarice, has just visited the dwellings which we\r\nsee. The old have been butchered, because unfit for slavery, and the\r\nyoung have been carried off, except such as have fallen in the conflict,\r\nor have escaped among the woods behind us.\r\n\r\nBut let us hasten from this cruel scene, which gives rise to so many\r\nmelancholy reflections. Let us cross yon distant river, and enter into\r\nsome new domain. But are we relieved even here from afflicting\r\nspectacles? Look at that immense crowd which appears to be gathered in a\r\nring. See the accused innocent in the middle! The ordeal of poisonous\r\nwater has been administered to him, as a test of his innocence or his\r\nguilt: he begins to be sick and pale. Alas! yon mournful shriek of his\r\nrelatives confirms that the loss of his freedom is now sealed.\r\n\r\nAnd whither shall we go now? the night is approaching fast. Let us find\r\nsome friendly hut, where sleep may make us forget for a while the\r\nsorrows of the day. Behold a hospitable native ready to receive us at\r\nhis door! let us avail ourselves of his kindness. And now let its give\r\nourselves to repose. But why, when our eyelids are but just closed, do\r\nwe find ourselves thus suddenly awakened? What is the meaning of the\r\nnoise around us, of the trampling of people's feet, of the rustling of\r\nthe bow, the quiver, and the lance? Let us rise up and inquire. Behold!\r\nthe inhabitants are all alarmed! a wakeful woman has shown them yon\r\ndistant column of smoke and blaze. The neighbouring village is on fire:\r\nthe prince, unfaithful to the sacred duty of the protection of his\r\nsubjects, has surrounded them. He is now burning their habitations, and\r\nseizing, as saleable booty, the fugitives from the flames.\r\n\r\nSuch then are some of the scenes that have been passing in Africa, in\r\nconsequence, of the existence of the Slave Trade; or such is the nature\r\nof the evil, as it has shown itself in the first of the cases we have\r\nnoticed. Let us now estimate it as it has been proved to exist in the\r\nsecond; or let us examine the state of the unhappy Africans reduced to\r\nslavery in this manner, while on board the vessels, which are to convey\r\nthem across the ocean to other lands. And here I must observe at once,\r\nthat, as far as this part of the evil is concerned, I am at a loss to\r\ndescribe it. Where shall I find words to express properly their sorrow,\r\nas arising from the reflection of being parted for ever from their\r\nfriends, their relatives, and their country? Where shall I find language\r\nto paint, in appropriate colours, the horror of mind brought on by\r\nthoughts of their future unknown destination, of which they can augur\r\nnothing but misery from all that they have yet seen? How shall I make\r\nknown their situation, while labouring, under painful disease, or while\r\nstruggling in the suffocating holds of their prisons, like animals\r\nenclosed in an exhausted receiver? How shall I describe their feelings\r\nas exposed to all the personal indignities, which lawless appetite or\r\nbrutal passion may suggest? How shall I exhibit their sufferings as\r\ndetermining to refuse sustenance and die, or as resolving to break their\r\nchains, and, disdaining to live as slaves, to punish their oppressors?\r\nHow shall I give an idea of their agony when under various punishments\r\nand tortures for their reputed crimes? Indeed, every part of this\r\nsubject defies my powers, and I must, therefore, satisfy myself and the\r\nreader with a general representation, or in the words of a celebrated\r\nmember of Parliament, that \"Never was so much human suffering condensed\r\nin so small a space.\"\r\n\r\nI come now to the evil, as it has been proved to arise in the third\r\ncase; or to consider the situation of the unhappy victims of the trade,\r\nwhen their painful voyages are over, or after they have been landed upon\r\ntheir destined shores. And here we are to view them, first under the\r\ndegrading light of cattle: we are to see them examined, handled,\r\nselected, separated, and sold. Alas! relatives are separated from\r\nrelatives, as if, like cattle, they had no rational intellect, no power\r\nof feeling the nearness of relationship, nor sense of the duties\r\nbelonging to the ties of life! We are next to see them labouring; and\r\nthis for the benefit of those to whom they are under no obligation, by\r\nany law either natural or divine, to obey. We are to see them, if\r\nrefusing the commands of their purchasers, however weary, or feeble, or\r\nindisposed, subject to corporal punishments, and if forcibly resisting\r\nthem to death: we are to see them in a state of general degradation and\r\nmisery. The knowledge which their oppressors have of their own crime, in\r\nhaving violated the rights of nature, and of the disposition of the\r\ninjured to seek all opportunities of revenge, produces a fear which\r\ndictates to them the necessity of a system of treatment, by which they\r\nshall keep up a wide distinction between the two, and by which the noble\r\nfeelings of the latter shall be kept down, and their spirits broken. We\r\nare to see them again subject to individual persecution, as anger, or\r\nmalice, or any bad passion may suggest: hence the whip, the chain, the\r\niron-collar! hence the various modes of private torture, of which so\r\nmany accounts have been truly given. Nor can such horrible cruelties be\r\ndiscovered so as to be made punishable, while the testimony of any\r\nnumber of the oppressed is invalid against the oppressors, however they\r\nmay be offences against the laws. And, lastly, we are to see their\r\ninnocent offspring, against whose personal liberty the shadow of an\r\nargument cannot be advanced, inheriting all the miseries of their\r\nparents' lot.\r\n\r\nThe evil then, as far as it has been hitherto viewed, presents to us, in\r\nits three several departments, a measure of human suffering not to be\r\nequalled--not to be calculated--not to be described. But would that we\r\ncould consider this part of the subject as dismissed! would that in each\r\nof the departments now examined there was no counterpart left us to\r\ncontemplate! But this cannot be; for if there be persons who suffer\r\nunjustly there must be others who oppress: and if there be those who\r\noppress, there must be to the suffering, which has been occasioned, a\r\ncorresponding portion of immorality or guilt.\r\n\r\nWe are obliged then to view the counterpart of the evil in question,\r\nbefore we can make a proper estimate of the nature of it. And, in\r\nexamining this part of it, we shall find that we have a no less\r\nfrightful picture to behold than in the former cases; or that, while the\r\nmiseries endured by the unfortunate Africans excite our pity on the one\r\nhand, the vices, which are connected with them, provoke our indignation\r\nand abhorrence on the other. The Slave Trade, in this point of view,\r\nmust strike us as an immense mass of evil on account of the criminality\r\nattached to it, as displayed in the various branches of it, which have\r\nalready been examined. For, to take the counterpart of the evil in the\r\nfirst of these, can we say that no moral turpitude is to be placed to\r\nthe account of those, who, living on the continent of Africa, give birth\r\nto the enormities, which take place in consequence of the prosecution of\r\nthis trade? Is not that man made morally worse, who is induced to become\r\na tiger to his species, or who, instigated by avarice, lies in wait in\r\nthe thicket to get possession of his fellow-man? Is no injustice\r\nmanifest in the land, where the prince, unfaithful to his duty, seizes\r\nhis innocent subjects, and sells them for slaves? Are no moral evils\r\nproduced among those communities, which make war upon other communities\r\nfor the sake of plunder, and without any previous provocation or\r\noffence? Does no crime attach to those, who accuse others falsely, or\r\nwho multiply and divide crimes for the sake of the profit of the\r\npunishment, and who for the same reason continue the use of barbarous\r\nand absurd ordeals as a test of innocence or guilt?\r\n\r\nIn the second of these branches, the counterpart of the evil is to be\r\nseen in the conduct of those who purchase the miserable natives in their\r\nown country, and convey them to distant lands. And here questions,\r\nsimilar to the former, may be asked. Do they experience no corruption of\r\ntheir nature, or become chargeable with no violation of right, who, when\r\nthey go with their ships to this continent, know the enormities which\r\ntheir visits there will occasion, who buy their fellow-creature man, and\r\nthis, knowing the way in which he comes into their hands, and who chain,\r\nand imprison, and scourge him? Do the moral feelings of those persons\r\nescape without injury, whose hearts are hardened? And can the hearts of\r\nthose be otherwise than hardened, who are familiar with the tears and\r\ngroans of innocent strangers forcibly torn away from every thing that is\r\ndear to them in life, who are accustomed to see them on board their\r\nvessels in a state of suffocation and in the agonies of despair, and who\r\nare themselves in the habit of the cruel use of arbitrary power?\r\n\r\nThe counterpart of the evil in its third branch is to be seen in the\r\nconduct of those, who, when these miserable people have been landed,\r\npurchase and carry them to their respective homes. And let us see\r\nwhether a mass of wickedness is not generated also in the present case.\r\nCan those have nothing to answer for, who separate the faithful ties\r\nwhich nature and religion have created? Can their feelings be otherwise\r\nthan corrupted, who consider their fellow-creatures as brutes, or treat\r\nthose as cattle, who may become the temples of the Holy Spirit, and in\r\nwhom the Divinity disdains not himself to dwell? Is there no injustice\r\nin forcing men to labour without wages? Is there no breach of duty, when\r\nwe are commanded to clothe the naked, and feed the hungry, and visit the\r\nsick and in prison, in exposing them to want, in torturing them by cruel\r\npunishment, and in grinding them down by hard labour, so as to shorten\r\ntheir days? Is there no crime in adopting a system, which keeps down all\r\nthe noble faculties of their souls, and which positively debases and\r\ncorrupts their nature? Is there no crime in perpetuating these evils\r\namong their innocent offspring? And finally, besides all these crimes,\r\nis there not naturally in the familiar sight of the exercise, but more\r\nespecially in the exercise itself, of uncontrolled power, that which\r\nvitiates the internal man? In seeing misery stalk daily over the land,\r\ndo not all become insensibly hardened? By giving birth to that misery\r\nthemselves, do they not become abandoned? In what state of society are\r\nthe corrupt appetites so easily, so quickly, and so frequently indulged,\r\nand where else, by means of frequent indulgence, do these experience\r\nsuch a monstrous growth? Where else is the temper subject to such\r\nfrequent irritation, or passion to such little control? Yes--if the\r\nunhappy slave is in an unfortunate situation, so is the tyrant who holds\r\nhim. Action and reaction are equal to each other, as well in the moral\r\nas in the natural world. You cannot exercise an improper dominion over a\r\nfellow-creature, but by a wise ordering of Providence you must\r\nnecessarily injure yourself.\r\n\r\nHaving now considered the nature of the evil of the Slave Trade in its\r\nthree separate departments of suffering, and in its corresponding\r\ncounterparts of guilt, I shall make a few observations on the extent of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn this subject it must strike us, that the misery and the crimes\r\nincluded in the evil, as it has been found in Africa, were not like\r\ncommon maladies, which make a short or periodical visit and then are\r\ngone, but that they were continued daily. Nor were they like diseases,\r\nwhich from local causes attack a village or a town, and by the skill of\r\nthe physician, under the blessing of Providence, are removed; but they\r\naffected a whole continent. The trade with all its horrors began at the\r\nriver Senegal, and continued, winding with the coast, through its\r\nseveral geographical divisions to Cape Negro; a distance of more than\r\nthree thousand miles. In various lines or paths formed at right angles\r\nfrom the shore, and passing into the heart of the country, slaves were\r\nprocured and brought down. The distance, which many of them travelled,\r\nwas immense. Those, who have been in Africa, have assured us, that they\r\ncame as far as from the sources of their largest rivers, which we know\r\nto be many hundred miles inland, and the natives have told us, in their\r\nway of computation, that they came a journey of many moons.\r\n\r\nIt must strike us again, that the misery and the crimes, included in the\r\nevil, as it has been shown in the transportation, had no ordinary\r\nbounds. They were not to be seen in the crossing of a river, but of an\r\nocean. They did not begin in the morning and end at night, but were\r\ncontinued for many weeks, and sometimes by casualties for a quarter of\r\nthe year. They were not limited to the precincts of a solitary ship, but\r\nwere spread among many vessels; and these were so constantly passing,\r\nthat the ocean itself never ceased to be a witness of their existence.\r\n\r\nAnd it must strike us, finally, that the misery and crimes, included in\r\nthe evil as it has been found in foreign lands, were not confined within\r\nthe shores of a little island. Most of the islands of a continent, and\r\nmany of these of considerable population and extent, were filled with\r\nthem. And the continent itself, to which these geographically belong,\r\nwas widely polluted by their domain. Hence, if we were to take the vast\r\nextent of space occupied by these crimes and sufferings from the heart\r\nof Africa to its shores, and that which they filled on the continent of\r\nAmerica and the islands adjacent, and were to join the crimes and\r\nsufferings in one to those in the other, by the crimes and sufferings\r\nwhich took place in the track of the vessels successively crossing the\r\nAtlantic, we should behold a vast belt as it were of physical and moral\r\nevil, reaching through land and ocean to the length of nearly half the\r\ncircle of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe next view which I shall take of this evil will be as it relates to\r\nthe difficulty of subduing it.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty may be supposed to have been more than ordinarily great.\r\nMany evils of a public nature, which existed in former times, were the\r\noffspring of ignorance and superstition, and they were subdued of course\r\nby the progress of light and knowledge. But the evil in question began\r\nin avarice. It was nursed also by worldly interest. It did not therefore\r\nso easily yield to the usual correctives of disorders in the world. We\r\nmay observe also, that the interest by which it was thus supported, was\r\nnot that of a few individuals, nor of one body, but of many bodies of\r\nmen. It was interwoven again into the system of the commerce and of the\r\nrevenue of nations. Hence the merchant--the planter--the mortgagee--the\r\nmanufacturer--the politician--the legislator--the\r\ncabinet-minister--lifted up their voices against the annihilation of it.\r\nFor these reasons, the Slave Trade may be considered like the fabulous\r\nhydra, to have a hundred heads, every one of which it was necessary to\r\ncut off before it could be subdued. And as none but Hercules was fitted\r\nto conquer the one, so nothing less than extraordinary prudence,\r\ncourage, labour, and patience, could overcome the other. To protection\r\nin this manner by his hundred interests, it was owing, that the monster\r\nstalked in security for so long a time. He stalked too in the open day,\r\ncommitting his mighty depredations. And when good men, whose duty it was\r\nto mark him as the object of their destruction, began to assail him, he\r\ndid not fly, but gnashed his teeth at them, growling savagely at the\r\nsame time, and putting himself into a posture of defiance.\r\n\r\nWe see then, in whatever light we consider the Slave Trade, whether we\r\nexamine into the nature of it, or whether we look into the extent of it,\r\nor whether we estimate the difficulty of subduing it, we must conclude\r\nthat no evil more monstrous has ever existed upon earth. But if so, then\r\nwe have proved the truth of the position, that the abolition of it ought\r\nto be accounted by us as one of the greatest blessings, and that it\r\nought to be one of the most copious sources of our joy. Indeed, I do not\r\nknow, how we can sufficiently express what we ought to feel upon this\r\noccasion. It becomes us, as individuals, to rejoice. It becomes us, as a\r\nnation, to rejoice. It becomes us even to perpetuate our joy to our\r\nposterity. I do not mean, however, by anniversaries, which are to be\r\ncelebrated by the ringing of bells and convivial meetings, but by\r\nhanding down this great event so impressively to our children, as to\r\nraise in them, if not continual, yet frequently renewed thanksgivings,\r\nto the great Creator of the universe, for the manifestation of this his\r\nfavour, in having disposed our legislators to take away such a portion\r\nof suffering from our fellow-creatures, and such a load of guilt from\r\nour native land.\r\n\r\nAnd as the contemplation of the removal of this monstrous evil should\r\nexcite in us the most pleasing and grateful sensations, so the perusal\r\nof the history of it should afford us lessons, which it must be useful\r\nto us to know or to be reminded of. For it cannot be otherwise than\r\nuseful to us to know the means which have been used, and the different\r\npersons who have moved in so great a cause. It cannot be otherwise than\r\nuseful to us to be impressively reminded of the simple axiom which the\r\nperusal of this history will particularly suggest to us, that \"the\r\ngreatest works must have a beginning;\" because the fostering of such an\r\nidea in our minds cannot but encourage us to undertake the removal of\r\nevils, however vast they may appear in their size, or however difficult\r\nto overcome. It cannot, again, be otherwise than useful to us to be\r\nassured, (and this history will assure us of it,) that in any work,\r\nwhich is a work of righteousness, however small the beginning may be, or\r\nhowever small the progress may be that we may make in it, we ought never\r\nto despair; for that, whatever checks and discouragements we may meet\r\nwith, \"no virtuous effort is ever ultimately lost.\" And finally, it\r\ncannot be otherwise than useful to us, to form the opinion, which the\r\ncontemplation of this subject must always produce, namely, that many of\r\nthe evils which are still left among us, may, by an union of wise and\r\nvirtuous individuals, be greatly alleviated, if not entirely done away;\r\nfor if the great evil of the Slave Trade, so deeply entrenched by its\r\nhundred interests, has fallen prostrate before the efforts of those who\r\nattacked it, what evil of a less magnitude shall not be more easily\r\nsubdued? O may reflections of this sort always enliven us, always\r\nencourage us, always stimulate us to our duty! May we never cease to\r\nbelieve, that many of the miseries of life are still to be remedied, or\r\nto rejoice that we may be permitted, if we will only make ourselves\r\nworthy by our endeavours, to heal them! May we encourage for this\r\npurpose every generous sympathy that arises in our hearts, as the\r\noffspring of the Divine influence for our good, convinced that we are\r\nnot born for ourselves alone, and that the Divinity never so fully\r\ndwells in us, as when we do his will, and that we never do his will more\r\nagreeably, as far as it has been revealed to us, than when we employ our\r\ntime in works of charity towards the rest of our fellow-creatures!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAs it is desirable to know the true sources of events in history, so\r\nthis will be realized in that of the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade.--Inquiry as to those who favoured the cause of the Africans\r\npreviously to the year 1787.--All these to be considered as necessary\r\nforerunners in that cause.--First forerunners were Cardinal Ximenes;\r\nthe Emperor Charles the Fifth; Pope Leo the Tenth; Elizabeth, queen of\r\nEngland; Louis the Thirteenth, of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be considered by many, who have stood at the mouth of a river,\r\nand witnessed its torrent there, to be both an interesting and a\r\npleasing journey to go to the fountain head, and then to travel on its\r\nbanks downwards, and to mark the different streams in each side, which\r\nshould run into it and feed it. So I presume the reader will not be a\r\nlittle interested and entertained, in viewing with me the course of the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade, in first finding its source, and then in\r\ntracing the different springs which have contributed to its increase.\r\nAnd here I may observe that, in doing this, we shall have advantages,\r\nwhich historians have not always had in developing the causes of things.\r\nMany have handed down to us, events, for the production of which they\r\nhave given us but their own conjectures. There has been often, indeed,\r\nsuch a distance between the events themselves, and the lives of those\r\nwho have recorded them, that the different means and motives belonging\r\nto them have been lost through time. On the present occasion, however,\r\nwe shall have the peculiar satisfaction of knowing, that we communicate\r\nthe truth, or that those which we unfold, are the true causes and means;\r\nfor the most remote of all the human springs, which can be traced as\r\nhaving any bearing upon the great event in question, will fall within\r\nthe period of three centuries, and the most powerful of them within the\r\nlast twenty years. These circumstances indeed have had their share in\r\ninducing me to engage in the present history. Had I measured it by the\r\nimportance of the subject, I had been deterred; but believing that most\r\nreaders love the truth, and that it ought to be the object of all\r\nwriters to promote it, and believing, moreover, that I was in possession\r\nof more facts on this subject than any other person, I thought I was\r\npeculiarly called to undertake it.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the different streams from whence the torrent arose, which\r\nhas now happily swept away the Slave Trade, I must begin with an inquiry\r\nas to those who favoured the cause of the injured Africans, from the\r\nyear 1516, to the year 1787, at which latter period, a number of persons\r\nassociated themselves, in England, for its abolition. For though they,\r\nwho belonged to this association, may, in consequence of having pursued\r\na regular system, be called the principal actors, yet it must be\r\nacknowledged, that their efforts would never have been so effectual, if\r\nthe minds of men had not been prepared by others, who had moved before\r\nthem. Great events have never taken place without previously disposing\r\ncauses. So it is in the case before us. Hence they, who lived even in\r\nearly times, and favoured this great cause, may be said to have been\r\nnecessary precursors in it. And here it may be proper to observe, that\r\nit is by no means necessary that all these should have been themselves\r\nactors in the production of this great event. Persons have contributed\r\ntowards it in different ways:--Some have written expressly on the\r\nsubject, who have had no opportunity of promoting it by personal\r\nexertions. Others have only mentioned it incidentally in their writings.\r\nOthers, in an elevated rank and station, have cried out publicly\r\nconcerning it, whose sayings have been recorded. All these, however, may\r\nbe considered as necessary forerunners in their day; for all of them\r\nhave brought the subject more or less into notice. They have more or\r\nless enlightened the mind upon it; they have more or less impressed it;\r\nand therefore each may be said to have had his share in diffusing and\r\nkeeping up a certain portion of knowledge and feeling concerning it,\r\nwhich has been eminently useful in the promotion of the cause.\r\n\r\nIt is rather remarkable, that the first forerunners and coadjutors\r\nshould have been men in power.\r\n\r\nSo early as in the year 1503, a few slaves had been sent from the\r\nPortuguese settlements in Africa into the Spanish colonies in America.\r\nIn 1511, Ferdinand the Fifth, king of Spain, permitted them to be\r\ncarried in great numbers. Ferdinand, however, must have been ignorant in\r\nthese early times of the piratical manner in which the Portuguese had\r\nprocured them. He could have known nothing of their treatment when in\r\nbondage, nor could he have viewed the few uncertain adventurous\r\ntransportations of them into his dominions in the western world, in the\r\nlight of a regular trade. After his death, however; a proposal was made\r\nby Bartholomew de las Casas, the bishop of Chiapa, to Cardinal Ximenes,\r\nwho held the reigns of the government of Spain till Charles the Fifth\r\ncame to the throne, for the establishment of a regular system of\r\ncommerce in the persons of the native Africans. The object of\r\nBartholomew de las Casas was undoubtedly to save the American Indians,\r\nwhose cruel treatment and almost extirpation he had witnessed during his\r\nresidence among them, and in whose behalf he had undertaken a voyage to\r\nthe court of Spain. It is difficult to reconcile this proposal with the\r\nhumane and charitable spirit of the bishop of Chiapa. But it is probable\r\nhe believed that a code of laws would soon be established in favour both\r\nof Africans and of the natives in the Spanish settlements, and that he\r\nflattered himself that, being about to return and to live in the country\r\nof their slavery, he could look to the execution of it. The cardinal,\r\nhowever, with a foresight, a benevolence, and a justice which will\r\nalways do honour to his memory, refused the proposal, not only judging\r\nit to be unlawful to consign innocent people to slavery at all, but to\r\nbe very inconsistent to deliver the inhabitants of one country from a\r\nstate of misery by consigning to it those of another. Ximenes,\r\ntherefore, may be considered as one of the first great friends of the\r\nAfricans after the partial beginning of the trade.\r\n\r\nThis answer of the cardinal, as it showed his virtue as an individual,\r\nso was it peculiarly honourable to him as a public man, and ought to\r\noperate as a lesson to other statesmen, how they admit any thing new\r\namong political regulations and establishments, which is connected in\r\nthe smallest degree with injustice; for evil, when once sanctioned by\r\ngovernments, spreads in a tenfold degree, and may, unless seasonably\r\nchecked, become so ramified as to effect the reputation of a country,\r\nand to render its own removal scarcely possible without detriment to the\r\npolitical concerns of the state. In no instance has this been verified\r\nmore than in the case of the Slave Trade. Never was our national\r\ncharacter more tarnished, and our prosperity more clouded by guilt.\r\nNever was there a monster more difficult to subdue. Even they, who heard\r\nas it were the shrieks of oppression, and wished to assist the\r\nsufferers, were fearful of joining in their behalf. While they\r\nacknowledged the necessity of removing one evil, they were terrified by\r\nthe prospect of introducing another; and were, therefore, only able to\r\nrelieve their feelings by, lamenting, in the bitterness of their hearts,\r\nthat this traffic had ever been begun at all.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Cardinal Ximenes, the emperor Charles the Fifth, who\r\nhad come into power, encouraged the Slave Trade. In 1517, he granted a\r\npatent to one of his Flemish favourites, containing an exclusive right\r\nof importing four thousand Africans into America. But he lived long\r\nenough to repent of what he had thus inconsiderately done; for in the\r\nyear 1542, he made a code of laws for the better protection of the\r\nunfortunate Indians in his foreign dominions, and he stopped the\r\nprogress of African slavery by an order that all slaves in his American\r\nislands should he made free. This order was executed by Pedro de la\r\nGasca. Manumission took place as well in Hispaniola as on the Continent;\r\nbut on the return of Gasca to Spain, and the retirement of Charles into\r\na monastery, slavery was revived.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to pass over this instance of the abolition of slavery\r\nby Charles, in all his foreign dominions, without some comments. It\r\nshows him, first, to have been a friend both to the Indians and the\r\nAfricans, as a part of the human race; it shows he was ignorant of what\r\nhe was doing when he gave his sanction to this cruel trade; it shows\r\nwhen legislators give one set of men undue power over another, how\r\nquickly they abuse it, or he never would have found himself obliged, in\r\nthe short space of twenty-five years, to undo that which he had\r\ncountenanced as a great state measure; and while it confirms the former\r\nlesson to statesmen of watching the beginnings or principles of things\r\nin their political movements, it should teach them never to persist in\r\nthe support of evils, through the false shame of being obliged to\r\nconfess that they had once given them their sanction, nor to delay the\r\ncure of them because, politically speaking, neither this nor that is the\r\nproper season; but to do them away instantly, as there can only be one\r\nfit or proper time in the eye of religion, namely, on the conviction of\r\ntheir existence.\r\n\r\nFrom the opinions of Cardinal Ximenes and of the emperor Charles the\r\nFifth, I hasten to that which was expressed much about the same time, in\r\na public capacity, by Pope Leo the Tenth. The Dominicans in Spanish\r\nAmerica, witnessing the cruel treatment which the slaves underwent\r\nthere, considered slavery as utterly repugnant to the principles of the\r\ngospel, and recommended the abolition of it. The Franciscans did not\r\nfavour the former in this their scheme of benevolence; and the\r\nconsequence was, that a controversy on this subject sprung up between\r\nthem, which was carried to this pope for his decision. Leo exerted\r\nhimself, much to his honour, in behalf of the poor sufferers, and\r\ndeclared \"That not only the Christian religion, but that Nature herself\r\ncried out against a state of slavery.\" This answer was certainly worthy\r\nof one who was deemed the head of the Christian Church. It must,\r\nhowever, be confessed that it would have been strange if Leo, in his\r\nsituation as pontiff, had made a different reply. He could never have\r\ndenied that God was no respecter of persons. He must have acknowledged\r\nthat men were bound to love each other as brethren; and, if he admitted\r\nthe doctrine that all men were accountable for their actions hereafter,\r\nhe could never have prevented the deduction that it was necessary they\r\nshould be free. Nor could he, as a man of high attainments, living early\r\nin the sixteenth century, have been ignorant of what had taken place in\r\nthe twelfth; or that, by the latter end of this latter century,\r\nchristianity had obtained the undisputed honour of having extirpated\r\nslavery from the western part of the European world.\r\n\r\nFrom Spain and Italy I come to England. The first importation of slaves\r\nfrom Africa, by our countrymen, was in the reign of Elizabeth, in the\r\nyear 1562. This great princess seems on the very commencement of the\r\ntrade to have questioned its lawfulness. She seems to have entertained a\r\nreligious scruple concerning it; and, indeed, to have revolted at the\r\nvery thought of it. She seems to have been aware of the evils to which\r\nits continuance might lead, or that, if it were sanctioned, the most\r\nunjustifiable means might be made use of to procure the persons of the\r\nnatives of Africa. And in what light she would have viewed any acts of\r\nthis kind, had they taken place, we may conjecture from this fact,--that\r\nwhen Captain (afterwards Sir John) Hawkins returned from his first\r\nvoyage to Africa and Hispaniola, whither he had carried slaves, she sent\r\nfor him, and, as we learn from Hill's _Naval History_ expressed her\r\nconcern lest any of the Africans should be carried off without their\r\nfree consent, declaring that \"it would be detestable, and call down the\r\nvengeance of heaven upon the undertakers.\" Captain Hawkins promised to\r\ncomply with the injunctions of Elizabeth in this respect, but he did not\r\nkeep his word; for when he went to Africa again, he seized many of the\r\ninhabitants and carried them off as slaves, which occasioned Hill, in\r\nthe account he gives of his second voyage, to use these remarkable\r\nwords:--\"Here began the horrid practice of forcing the Africans into\r\nslavery, an injustice and barbarity which, so sure as there is vengeance\r\nin heaven for the worst of crimes, will some time be the destruction of\r\nall who allow or encourage it.\" That the trade should have been suffered\r\nto continue under such a princess, and after such solemn expressions as\r\nthose which she has been described to have uttered, can be only\r\nattributed to the pains taken by those concerned in it to keep her\r\nignorant of the truth.\r\n\r\nFrom England I now pass over to France. Labat, a Roman missionary, in\r\nhis account of the isles of America, mentions that Louis the Thirteenth\r\nwas very uneasy when he was about to issue the edict by which all\r\nAfricans coming into his colonies were to be made slaves, and that this\r\nuneasiness continued till he was assured that the introduction of them\r\nin this capacity into his foreign dominions was the readiest way of\r\nconverting them to the principles of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the first forerunners in the great cause of the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade: nor have their services towards it been of\r\nsmall moment; for, in the first place, they have enabled those who came\r\nafter them, and who took an active interest in the same cause, to state\r\nthe great authority of their opinions and of their example. They have\r\nenabled them, again, to detail the history connected with these, in\r\nconsequence of which circumstances have been laid open which it is of\r\ngreat importance to know; for have they not enabled them to state that\r\nthe African Slave Trade never would have been permitted to exist but for\r\nthe ignorance of those in authority concerning it--that at its\r\ncommencement there was a revolting of nature against it--a suspicion, a\r\ncaution, a fear, both as to its unlawfulness and its effects? Have they\r\nnot enabled them to state that falsehoods were advanced, and these\r\nconcealed under the mask of religion, to deceive those who had the power\r\nto suppress it? Have they not enabled them to state that this trade\r\nbegan in piracy, and that it was continued upon the principles of force?\r\nAnd, finally, have not they who have been enabled to make these\r\nstatements, knowing all the circumstances connected with them, found\r\ntheir own zeal increased, and their own courage and perseverance\r\nstrengthened; and have they not, by the communication of them to others,\r\nproduced many friends and even labourers in the cause?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nForerunners continued to 1787; divided from this time into four\r\nclasses.--First class consists principally of persons in Great Britain\r\nof various descriptions: Godwyn; Baxter; Tryon; Southern; Primatt;\r\nMontesquieu; Hutcheson; Sharp; Ramsay; and a multitude of others,\r\nwhose names and services follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have hitherto traced the history of the forerunners in this great\r\ncause only up to about the year 1640. If I am to pursue my plan, I am to\r\ntrace it to the year 1787. But in order to show what I intend in a\r\nclearer point of view, I shall divide those who have lived within this\r\nperiod, and who will now consist of persons in a less elevated station,\r\ninto four classes: and I shall give to each class a distinct\r\nconsideration by itself.\r\n\r\nSeveral of our old English writers, though they have not mentioned the\r\nAfrican Slave Trade, or the slavery consequent upon it, in their\r\nrespective works, have yet given their testimony of condemnation against\r\nboth. Thus our great Milton:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  O execrable son, so to aspire,\r\n  Above his brethren, to himself assuming\r\n  Authority usurpt, from God not given;\r\n  He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,\r\n  Dominion absolute; that right we hold\r\n  By his donation; but man over men\r\n  He made not lord, such title to himself\r\n  Reserving, human left from human free.\r\n\r\n\r\nI might mention Bishop Saunderson and others, who bore a testimony\r\nequally strong against the lawfulness of trading in the persons of men,\r\nand of holding them in bondage; but as I mean to confine myself to those\r\nwho have favoured the cause of the Africans specifically, I cannot admit\r\ntheir names into any of the classes which have been announced.\r\n\r\nOf those, who compose the first class, defined as it has now been, I\r\ncannot name any individual who took a part in this cause till between\r\nthe years 1670 and 1680; for in the year 1640, and for a few years\r\nafterwards, the nature of the trade and of the slavery was but little\r\nknown, except to a few individuals, who were concerned in them; and it\r\nis obvious that these would neither endanger their own interest nor\r\nproclaim their own guilt by exposing it. The first, whom I shall mention\r\nis Morgan Godwyn, a clergyman of the established church. This pious\r\ndivine wrote a treatise upon the subject, which he dedicated to the then\r\narchbishop of Canterbury. He gave it to the world, at the time\r\nmentioned, under the title of \"_The Negroes' and Indians' Advocate._\" In\r\nthis treatise he lays open the situation of these oppressed people, of\r\nwhose sufferings he had been an eye-witness in the island of Barbados.\r\nHe calls forth the pity of the reader in an affecting manner, and\r\nexposes with a nervous eloquence the brutal sentiments and conduct of\r\ntheir oppressors. This seems to have been the first work undertaken in\r\nEngland expressly in favour of the cause.\r\n\r\nThe next person, whom I shall mention, is Richard Baxter, the celebrated\r\ndivine among the nonconformists. In his _Christian Directory_, published\r\nabout the same time as _The Negroes' and Indians' Advocate_, he gives\r\nadvice to those masters in foreign plantations, who have negroes and\r\nother slaves. In this he protests loudly against this trade. He says\r\nexpressly that they, who go out as pirates, and take away poor Africans,\r\nor people of another land, who never forfeited life or liberty, and make\r\nthem slaves and sell them, are the worst of robbers, and ought to be\r\nconsidered as the common enemies of mankind; and that they who buy them,\r\nand use them as mere beasts for their own convenience, regardless of\r\ntheir spiritual welfare, are fitter to be called demons than christians.\r\nHe then proposes several queries, which he answers in a clear and\r\nforcible manner, showing the great inconsistency of this traffic, and\r\nthe necessity of treating those then in bondage with tenderness and a\r\ndue regard to their spiritual concerns.\r\n\r\nThe _Directory_ of Baxter was succeeded by a publication called\r\n_Friendly Advice to the Planters_ in three parts. The first of these\r\nwas, _A brief Treatise of the principal Fruits and Herbs that grow in\r\nBarbados, Jamaica, and other Plantations in the West Indies_. The second\r\nwas, _The Negroes' Complaint, or their hard Servitude, and the Cruelties\r\npractised upon them by divers of their Masters professing Christianity_.\r\nAnd the third was, _A Dialogue between an Ethiopian and a Christian, his\r\nMaster, in America_. In the last of these, Thomas Tryon, who was the\r\nauthor, inveighs both against the commerce and the slavery of the\r\nAfricans, and in a striking manner examines each by the touchstone of\r\nreason, humanity, justice, and religion.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1696, Southern brought forward his celebrated tragedy of\r\n_Oronooko_, by means of which many became enlightened upon the subject,\r\nand interested in it. For this tragedy was not a representation of\r\nfictitious circumstances, but of such as had occurred in the colonies,\r\nand as had been communicated in a publication by Mrs. Behn.\r\n\r\nThe person who seems to have noticed the subject next was Dr. Primatt.\r\nIn his _Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy, and on the Sin of Cruelty to\r\nBrute Animals_, he takes occasion to advert to the subject of the\r\nAfrican Slave Trade. \"It has pleased God,\" says he, \"to cover some men\r\nwith white skins and others with black; but as there is neither merit\r\nnor demerit in complexion, the white man, notwithstanding the barbarity\r\nof custom and prejudice, can have no right by virtue of his colour to\r\nenslave and tyrannize over the black man. For whether a man be white or\r\nblack, such he is by God's appointment, and, abstractly considered, is\r\nneither a subject for pride, nor an object of contempt.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Primatt, we come to Baron Montesquieu, \"Slavery,\" says he, \"is\r\nnot good in itself. It is neither useful to the master nor to the slave;\r\nnot to the slave, because he can do nothing from virtuous motives; not\r\nto the master, because he contracts among his slaves all sorts of bad\r\nhabits, and accustoms himself to the neglect of all the moral virtues.\r\nHe becomes haughty, passionate, obdurate, vindictive, voluptuous, and\r\ncruel.\" And with respect to this particular species of slavery, he\r\nproceeds to say, \"It is impossible to allow the negroes are men,\r\nbecause, if we allow them to be men, it will begin to be believed that\r\nwe ourselves are not Christians.\"\r\n\r\nHutcheson, in his _System of Moral Philosophy_, endeavours to show, that\r\nhe who detains another by force in slavery, can make no good title to\r\nhim, and adds, \"Strange that in any nation where a sense of liberty\r\nprevails, and where the Christian religion is professed, custom and high\r\nprospect of gain can so stupify the consciences of men, and all sense of\r\nnatural justice, that they can hear such computations made about the\r\nvalue of their fellow-men and their liberty, without abhorrence and\r\nindignation!\"\r\n\r\nFoster, in his _Discourses on Natural Religion and Social Virtue_, calls\r\nthe slavery under our consideration \"a criminal and outrageous violation\r\nof the natural rights of mankind.\" I am sorry that I have not room to\r\nsay all that he says on this subject. Perhaps the following beautiful\r\nextracts may suffice:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"But notwithstanding this, we ourselves, who profess to be\r\n    Christians, and boast of the peculiar advantages we enjoy by\r\n    means of an express revelation of our duty from heaven, are in\r\n    effect these very untaught and rude heathen countries. With all\r\n    our superior light, we instil into those whom we call savage and\r\n    barbarous, the most despicable opinion of human nature. We, to\r\n    the utmost of our power, weaken and dissolve the universal tie\r\n    that binds and unites mankind. We practise what we should\r\n    exclaim against as the utmost excess of cruelty and tyranny, if\r\n    nations of the world, differing in colour and form of government\r\n    from ourselves, were so possessed of empire as to be able to\r\n    reduce us to a state of unmerited and brutish servitude. Of\r\n    consequence, we sacrifice our reason, our humanity, our\r\n    Christianity, to an unnatural sordid gain. We teach other\r\n    nations to despise and trample under foot all the obligations of\r\n    social virtue. We take the most effectual method to prevent the\r\n    propagation of the Gospel, by representing it as a scheme of\r\n    power and barbarous oppression, and an enemy to the natural\r\n    privileges and rights of man.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Perhaps all that I have now offered may be of very little\r\n    weight to restrain this enormity, this aggravated iniquity.\r\n    However, I shall still have the satisfaction of having entered\r\n    my private protest against a practice which, in my opinion, bids\r\n    that God, who is the God and Father of the Gentiles unconverted\r\n    to Christianity, most daring and bold defiance, and spurns at\r\n    all the principles both of natural and revealed religion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next author is Sir Richard Steele, who, by means of the affecting\r\nstory of Inkle and Yarico, holds up this trade again to our abhorrence.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1735, Atkins, who was a surgeon in the navy, published his\r\n_Voyage to Guinea, Brazil, and the West Indies, in his Majesty's ships\r\nSwallow and Weymouth_. In this work he describes openly the manner of\r\nmaking the natives slaves, such as by kidnapping, by unjust accusations\r\nand trials, and by other nefarious means. He states also the cruelties\r\npractised upon them by the white people, and the iniquitous ways and\r\ndealings of the latter, and answers their argument, by which they\r\ninsinuated that the condition of the Africans was improved by their\r\ntransportation to other countries.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, the trade beginning to be better known, a multitude of\r\npersons of various stations and characters sprung up, who by exposing\r\nit, are to be mentioned among the forerunners and coadjutors in the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nPope, in his _Essay on Man_, where he endeavours to show that happiness\r\nin the present depends, among other things, upon the hope of a future\r\nstate, takes an opportunity of exciting compassion in behalf of the poor\r\nAfrican, while he censures the avarice and cruelty of his master:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutored mind\r\n  Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;\r\n  His soul proud Science never taught to stray\r\n  Far as the solar walk, or milky-way;\r\n  Yet simple Nature to his hope was given\r\n  Behind the cloud-topt hill an humbler heaven;\r\n  Some safer world in depth of woods embraced,\r\n  Some happier island in the watery waste,\r\n  Where slaves once more their native land behold,\r\n  No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomson also, in his _Seasons_, marks this traffic as destructive and\r\ncruel, introducing the well-known fact of sharks following the vessels\r\nemployed in it:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Increasing still the sorrows of those storms,\r\n  His jaws horrific arm'd with three-fold fate,\r\n  Here dwells the direful shark. Lured by the scent\r\n  Of steaming crowds, of rank disease, and death;\r\n  Behold! he rushing cuts the briny flood,\r\n  Swift as the gale can bear the ship along,\r\n  And from the partners of that cruel trade;\r\n  Which spoils unhappy Guinea of her sons,\r\n  Demands his share of prey, demands themselves.\r\n  The stormy fates descend: one death involves\r\n  Tyrants and slaves; when straight their mangled limbs\r\n  Crashing at once, he dyes the purple seas\r\n  With gore, and riots in the vengeful meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither was Richard Savage forgetful in his poems of the _Injured\r\nAfricans_: he warns their oppressors of a day of retribution for their\r\nbarbarous conduct. Having personified Public Spirit, he makes her speak\r\non the subject in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Let by my specious name no tyrants rise,\r\n  And cry, while they enslave, they civilize!\r\n  Know, Liberty and I are still the same\r\n  Congenial--ever mingling flame with flame!\r\n  Why must I Afric's sable children see\r\n  Vended for slaves, though born by nature free,\r\n  The nameless tortures cruel minds invent\r\n  Those to subject whom Nature equal meant?\r\n  If these you dare (although unjust success\r\n  Empowers you now unpunished, to oppress),\r\n  Revolving empire you and yours may doom--\r\n  (Rome all subdu'd--yet Vandals vanquish'd Rome)\r\n  Yes--Empire may revolt--give them the day,\r\n  And yoke may yoke, and blood may blood repay.\r\n\r\n\r\nWallis, in his _System of the Laws of Scotland_, maintains, that\r\n\"neither men nor governments have a right to sell those of their own\r\nspecies. Men and their liberty are neither purchaseable nor saleable.\"\r\nAnd, after arguing the case, he says, \"This is the law of nature, which\r\nis obligatory on all men, at all times, and in all places.--Would not\r\nany of us, who should be snatched by pirates from his native land, think\r\nhimself cruelly abused, and at all times entitled to be free? Have not\r\nthese unfortunate Africans, who meet with the same cruel fate, the same\r\nright? Are they not men as well as we? And have they not the same\r\nsensibility? Let us not, therefore, defend or support an usage, which is\r\ncontrary to all the laws of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1750, the reverend Griffith Hughes, rector of St. Lucy, in\r\nBarbados, published his Natural History of that island. He took an\r\nopportunity, in the course of it, of laying open to the world the\r\nmiserable situation of the poor Africans, and the waste of them by hard\r\nlabour and other cruel means, and he had the generosity to vindicate\r\ntheir capacities from the charge, which they who held them in bondage\r\nbrought against them, as a justification of their own wickedness in\r\ncontinuing to deprive them of the rights of men.\r\n\r\nEdmund Burke, in his account of the European settlements, (for this work\r\nis usually attributed to him,) complains \"that the Negroes in our\r\ncolonies endure a slavery more complete, and attended with far worse\r\ncircumstances, than what any people in their condition suffer, in any\r\nother part of the world, or have suffered in any other period of time.\r\nProofs of this are not wanting. The prodigious waste, which we\r\nexperience in this unhappy part of our species, is a full and melancholy\r\nevidence of this truth.\" And he goes on to advise the planters, for the\r\nsake of their own interest, to behave like good men, good masters, and\r\ngood Christians, and to impose less labour upon their slaves, and to\r\ngive them recreation on some of the grand festivals, and to instruct\r\nthem in religion, as certain preventives of their decrease.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous author of a pamphlet, entitled, _An Essay in Vindication of\r\nthe Continental Colonies of America_, seems to have come forward next.\r\nSpeaking of slavery there, he says, \"It is shocking to humanity,\r\nviolative of every generous sentiment, abhorrent utterly from the\r\nChristian religion.--There cannot be a more dangerous maxim than that\r\nnecessity is a plea for injustice, for who shall fix the degree of this\r\nnecessity? What villain so atrocious, who may not urge this excuse, or,\r\nas Milton has happily expressed it,\r\n\r\n  And with necessity,\r\n  The tyrant's plea, excuse his devilish deed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That our colonies,\" he continues, \"want people, is a very weak argument\r\nfor so inhuman a violation of justice.--Shall a civilized, a Christian\r\nnation encourage slavery, because the barbarous, savage, lawless African\r\nhath done it? To what end do we profess a religion whose dictates we so\r\nflagrantly violate? Wherefore have we that pattern of goodness and\r\nhumanity, if we refuse to follow it? How long shall we continue a\r\npractice which policy rejects, justice condemns, and piety revolts at?\"\r\n\r\nThe poet Shenstone, who comes next in order, seems to have written an\r\nelegy on purpose to stigmatize this trade. Of this elegy I shall copy\r\nonly the following parts:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  See the poor native quit the Libyan shores,\r\n  Ah! not in love's delightful fetters bound!\r\n  No radiant smile his dying peace restores,\r\n  No love, nor fame, nor friendship, heals his wound.\r\n\r\n  Let vacant bards display their boasted woes;\r\n  Shall I the mockery of grief display?\r\n  No; let the muse his piercing pangs disclose,\r\n  Who bleeds and weeps his sum of life away!\r\n\r\n  On the wild heath in mournful guise he stood,\r\n  Ere the shrill boatswain gave the hated sign;\r\n  He dropt a tear unseen into the flood,\r\n  He stole one secret moment to repine--\r\n\r\n  \"Why am I ravish'd from my native strand?\r\n  What savage race protects this impious gain?\r\n  Shall foreign plagues infest this teeming land,\r\n  And more than sea-born monsters plough the main?\r\n\r\n  Here the dire locusts' horrid swarms prevail;\r\n  Here the blue asps with livid poison swell;\r\n  Here the dry dipsa writhes his sinuous mail;\r\n  Can we not here secure from envy dwell?\r\n\r\n  When the grim lion urged his cruel chase,\r\n  When the stern panther sought his midnight prey;\r\n  What fate reserved me for this Christian race?\r\n  O race more polished, more severe than they!\r\n\r\n  Yet shores there are, bless'd shores for us remain,\r\n  And favour'd isles, with golden fruitage crown'd,\r\n  Where tufted flow'rets paint the verdant plain,\r\n  And every breeze shall medicine every wound.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1755, Dr. Hayter, bishop of Norwich, preached a sermon\r\nbefore the _Society for the Propagation of the Gospel_, in which he bore\r\nhis testimony against the continuance of this trade.\r\n\r\nDyer, in his poem called _The Fleece_, expresses his sorrow on account\r\nof this barbarous trade, and looks forward to a day of retributive\r\njustice on account of the introduction of such an evil.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1760, a pamphlet appeared, entitled, _Two Dialogues on the\r\nMan-trade_, by John Philmore. This name is supposed to be an assumed\r\none. The author, however, discovers himself to have been both an able\r\nand a zealous advocate in favour of the African race.\r\n\r\nMalachi Postlethwaite, in his _Universal Dictionary of Trade and\r\nCommerce_, proposes a number of queries on the subject of the Slave\r\nTrade. I have not room to insert them at full length, but I shall give\r\nthe following as the substance of some of them to the reader: \"Whether\r\nthis commerce be not the cause of incessant wars among the\r\nAfricans--Whether the Africans, if it were abolished, might not become\r\nas ingenious, as humane, as industrious, and as capable of arts,\r\nmanufactures, and trades, as even the bulk of Europeans--Whether, if it\r\nwere abolished, a much more profitable trade might not be substituted,\r\nand this to the very centre of their extended country, instead of the\r\ntrifling portion which now subsists upon their coasts--And whether the\r\ngreat hindrance to such a new and advantageous commerce has not wholly\r\nproceeded from that unjust, inhuman, unchristianlike traffic, called the\r\nSlave Trade, which is carried on by the Europeans.\" The public proposal\r\nof these and other queries by a man of so great commercial knowledge as\r\nPostlethwaite, and by one who was himself a member of the African\r\nCommittee, was of great service in exposing the impolicy as well as\r\nimmorality of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1761, Thomas Jeffery published an account of a part of North\r\nAmerica, in which he lays open the miserable state of the slaves in the\r\nWest Indies, both as to their clothing, their food, their labour, and\r\ntheir punishments. But, without going into particulars, the general\r\naccount be gives of them is affecting: \"It is impossible,\" he says, \"for\r\na human heart to reflect upon the slavery of these dregs of mankind,\r\nwithout in some measure feeling for their misery, which ends but with\r\ntheir lives--nothing can be more wretched than the condition of this\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nSterne, in his account of the Negro girl in his _Life of Tristram\r\nShandy_, took decidedly the part of the oppressed Africans. The\r\npathetic, witty, and sentimental manner, in which he handled this\r\nsubject, occasioned many to remember it, and procured a certain portion\r\nof feeling in their favour.\r\n\r\nRousseau contributed not a little in his day to the same end.\r\n\r\nBishop Warburton, preached a sermon in the year 1766, before the Society\r\nfor the Propagation of the Gospel, in which he took up the cause of the\r\nmiserable Africans, and in which he severely reprobated their\r\noppressors. The language in this sermon is so striking, that I shall\r\nmake an extract from it. \"From the free savages,\" says he, \"I now come\r\nto the savages in bonds. By these I mean the vast multitudes yearly\r\nstolen from the opposite continent, and sacrificed by the colonists to\r\ntheir great idol, the god of gain. But what then say these sincere\r\nworshippers of Mammon? They are our own property which we offer\r\nup,--Gracious God! to talk, as of herds of cattle, of property in\r\nrational creatures, creatures endued with all our faculties, possessing\r\nall our qualities but that of colour, our brethren both by nature and\r\ngrace, shocks all the feelings of humanity, and the dictates of common\r\nsense? But, alas! what is there, in the infinite abuses of society,\r\nwhich does not shock them! Yet nothing is more certain in itself and\r\napparent to all, than that the infamous traffic for slaves directly\r\ninfringes both divine and human law. Nature created man free, and grace\r\ninvites him to assert his freedom.\r\n\r\n\"In excuse of this violation it hath been pretended, that though,\r\nindeed, these miserable outcasts of humanity be torn from their homes\r\nand native country by fraud and violence, yet they thereby become the\r\nhappier, and their condition the more eligible. But who are you, who\r\npretend to judge of another man's happiness; that state which each man\r\nunder the guidance of his Maker forms for himself, and not one man for\r\nanother? To know what constitutes mine or your happiness is the sole\r\nprerogative of him who created us, and cast us in so various and\r\ndifferent moulds. Did your slaves ever complain to you of their\r\nunhappiness amidst their native woods and deserts? or rather let me ask,\r\ndid they ever cease complaining of their condition under you their\r\nlordly masters, where they see, indeed, the accommodations of civil\r\nlife, but see them all pass to others, themselves unbenefited by them?\r\nBe so gracious then, ye petty tyrants over human freedom, to let your\r\nslaves judge for themselves, what it is which makes their own happiness,\r\nand then see whether they do not place it in the return to their own\r\ncountry, rather than in the contemplation of your grandeur, of which\r\ntheir misery makes so large a part; a return so passionately longed for,\r\nthat, despairing of happiness here, that is, of escaping the chains of\r\ntheir cruel task-masters, they console themselves with feigning it to be\r\nthe gracious reward of heaven in their future state.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time certain cruel and wicked practices, which must now be\r\nmentioned, had arrived at such a height, and had become so frequent in\r\nthe metropolis, as to produce of themselves other coadjutors to the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1700, planters, merchants, and others, resident in the\r\nWest Indies, but coming to England, were accustomed to bring with them\r\ncertain slaves to act as servants with them during their stay. The\r\nlatter, seeing the freedom and the happiness of servants in this\r\ncountry, and considering what would be their own hard fate on their\r\nreturn to the islands, frequently absconded. Their masters of course\r\nmade search after them, and often had them seized and carried away by\r\nforce. It was, however, thrown out by many on these occasions, that the\r\nEnglish laws did not sanction such proceedings, for that all persons who\r\nwere baptized became free. The consequence of this was, that most of the\r\nslaves, who came over with their masters, prevailed upon some pious\r\nclergyman to baptize them. They took of course godfathers of such\r\ncitizens as had the generosity to espouse their cause. When they were\r\nseized they usually sent to these, if they had an opportunity, for their\r\nprotection. And in the result, their godfathers, maintaining that they\r\nhad been baptized, and that they were free on this account as well as by\r\nthe general tenour of the law of England, dared those who had taken\r\npossession of them to send them out of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe planters, merchants, and others, being thus circumstanced, knew not\r\nwhat to do. They were afraid of taking their slaves away by force, and\r\nthey were equally afraid of bringing any of the cases before a public\r\ncourt. In this dilemma, in 1729, they applied to York and Talbot, the\r\nattorney and solicitor-general for the time being, and obtained the\r\nfollowing strange opinion from them:--\"We are of opinion, that a slave\r\nby coming from the West Indies into Great Britain or Ireland, either\r\nwith or without his master, does not become free, and that his master's\r\nright and property in him is not thereby determined or varied, and that\r\nbaptism doth not bestow freedom on him, nor make any alteration in his\r\ntemporal condition in these kingdoms. We are also of opinion, that the\r\nmaster may legally compel him to return again to the plantations.\"\r\n\r\nThis cruel and illegal opinion was delivered in the year 1729. The\r\nplanters, merchants, and others, gave it of course all the publicity in\r\ntheir power. And the consequences were as might easily have been\r\napprehended. In a little time slaves absconding were advertised in the\r\nLondon papers as runaways, and rewards offered for the apprehension of\r\nthem, in the same brutal manner as we find them advertised in the land\r\nof slavery. They were advertised also, in the same papers, to be sold by\r\nauction, sometimes by themselves, and at others with horses, chaises,\r\nand harness? They were seized also by their masters, or by persons\r\nemployed by them, in the very streets, and dragged from thence to the\r\nships; and so unprotected now were these poor slaves, that persons in\r\nnowise concerned with them began to institute a trade in their persons,\r\nmaking agreements with captains of ships going to the West Indies to put\r\nthem on board at a certain price. This last instance shows how far human\r\nnature is capable of going, and is an answer to those persons who have\r\ndenied that kidnapping in Africa was a source of supplying the Slave\r\nTrade. It shows, as all history does from the time of Joseph, that where\r\nthere is a market for the persons of human beings, all kinds of\r\nenormities will be practised to obtain them.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances then, as I observed before, did not fail of\r\nproducing new coadjutors in the cause. And first they produced that able\r\nand indefatigable advocate, Mr. Granville Sharp. This gentleman is to be\r\ndistinguished from those who preceded him by this particular, that,\r\nwhereas these were only writers, he was both a writer and an actor in\r\nthe cause. In fact, he was the first labourer in it in England. By the\r\nwords \"actor\" and \"labourer,\" I mean that he determined upon a plan of\r\naction in behalf of the oppressed Africans, to the accomplishment of\r\nwhich he devoted a considerable portion of his time, talents, and\r\nsubstance. What Mr. Sharp has done to merit the title of coadjutor in\r\nthis high sense, I shall now explain. The following is a short history\r\nof the beginning and of the course of his labours:--\r\n\r\nIn the year 1765, Mr. David Lisle had brought over from Barbados\r\nJonathan Strong, an African slave, as his servant. He used the latter in\r\na barbarous manner at his lodgings in Wapping, but particularly by\r\nbeating him over the head with a pistol, which occasioned his head to\r\nswell. When the swelling went down, a disorder fell into his eyes, which\r\nthreatened the loss of them. To this an ague and fever succeeded, and a\r\nlameness in both his legs.\r\n\r\nJonathan Strong, having been brought into this deplorable situation, and\r\nbeing therefore wholly useless, was left by his master to go whither he\r\npleased. He applied accordingly to Mr. William Sharp, the surgeon, for\r\nhis advice, as to one who gave up a portion of his time to the healing\r\nof the diseases of the poor. It was here that Mr. Granville Sharp, the\r\nbrother of the former, saw him. Suffice it to say, that in process of\r\ntime he was cured. During this time Mr. Granville Sharp, pitying his\r\nhard case, supplied him with money, and he afterwards got him a\r\nsituation in the family of Mr. Brown, an apothecary, to carry out\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\nIn this new situation, when Strong had become healthy and robust in his\r\nappearance, his master happened to see him. The latter immediately\r\nformed the design of possessing him again. According, when he had found\r\nout his residence, he procured John Ross, keeper of the Poultry-counter,\r\nand William Miller, an officer under the Lord Mayor, to kidnap him. This\r\nwas done by sending for him to a public-house in Fenchurch-street, and\r\nthen seizing him. By these he was conveyed, without any warrant, to the\r\nPoultry-counter, where he was sold by his master, to John Kerr, for\r\nthirty pounds.\r\n\r\nStrong, in this situation, sent, as was usual, to his godfathers, John\r\nLondon and Stephen Nail, for their protections. They went, but were\r\nrefused admittance to him. At length he sent for Mr. Granville Sharp:\r\nthe latter went, but they still refused access to the prisoner. He\r\ninsisted, however, upon seeing him, and charged the keeper of the prison\r\nat his peril to deliver him up, till he had been carried before a\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nMr. Sharp, immediately upon this, waited upon Sir Robert Kite, the then\r\nlord mayor, and entreated him to send for Strong and to hear his case. A\r\nday was accordingly appointed. Mr. Sharp attended, and also William\r\nMcBean, a notary public, and David Laird, captain of the ship Thames,\r\nwhich was to have conveyed Strong to Jamaica, in behalf of the\r\npurchaser, John Kerr. A long conversation ensued, in which the opinion\r\nof York and Talbot was quoted. Mr. Sharp made his observations. Certain\r\nlawyers who were present seemed to be staggered at the case, but\r\ninclined rather to recommit the prisoner: the lord mayor, however,\r\ndischarged Strong, as he had been taken up without a warrant.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this determination was made known, the parties began to move\r\noff. Captain Laird, however, who kept close to Strong, laid hold of him\r\nbefore he had quitted the room, and said aloud, \"Then I now seize him as\r\nmy slave.\" Upon this Mr. Sharp put his hand upon Laird's shoulder, and\r\npronounced these words: \"I charge you, in the name of the king, with an\r\nassault upon the person of Jonathan Strong, and all these are my\r\nwitnesses.\" Laird was greatly intimidated by this charge, made in the\r\npresence of the lord mayor and others, and, fearing a prosecution, let\r\nhis prisoner go, leaving him to be conveyed away by Mr. Sharp.\r\n\r\nMr. Sharp having been greatly affected by this case, and foreseeing how\r\nmuch he might be engaged in others of a similar nature, thought it time\r\nthat the law of the land should be known upon this subject: he applied,\r\ntherefore, to Dr. Blackstone, afterwards Judge Blackstone, for his\r\nopinion upon it. He was, however, not satisfied with it when he received\r\nit; nor could he obtain any satisfactory answer from several other\r\nlawyers, to whom he afterwards applied. The truth is that the opinion of\r\nYork and Talbot, which had been made public and acted upon by the\r\nplanters, merchants, and others, was considered of high authority, and\r\nscarcely any one dared to question the legality of it. In this situation\r\nMr. Sharp saw no means of help but in his own industry, and he\r\ndetermined immediately to give up two or three years to the study of the\r\nEnglish law, that he might the better advocate the cause of these\r\nmiserable people. The result of these studies was the publication of a\r\nbook in the year 1769, which he called, _A Representation of the\r\nInjustice and Dangerous Tendency of Tolerating Slavery in England_. In\r\nthis work he refuted, in the clearest manner, the opinion of York and\r\nTalbot: he produced against it the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice\r\nHolt, who, many years before, had determined that every slave coming\r\ninto England became free: he attacked and refuted it again by a learned\r\nand laborious inquiry into all the principles of Villenage. He refuted\r\nit again by showing it to be an axiom in the British constitution, \"That\r\nevery man in England was free to sue for and defend his rights, and that\r\nforce could not be used without a legal process,\" leaving it to the\r\njudges to determine whether an African was a man. He attacked also the\r\nopinion of Judge Blackstone, and showed where his error lay. This\r\nvaluable book, containing these and other kinds of arguments on the\r\nsubject, he distributed, but particularly among the lawyers, giving them\r\nan opportunity of refuting or acknowledging the doctrines it contained.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Sharp was engaged in this work, another case offered, in which\r\nhe took a part: this was in the year 1768. Hylas, an African slave,\r\nprosecuted a person of the name of Newton for having kidnapped his wife,\r\nand sent her to the West Indies. The result of the trial was, that\r\ndamages to the amount of a shilling were given, and the defendant was\r\nbound to bring back the woman, either by the first ship, or in six\r\nmonths from this decision of the court.\r\n\r\nBut soon after the work just mentioned was out, and when Mr. Sharp was\r\nbetter prepared, a third case occurred: this happened in the year 1770.\r\nRobert Stapylton, who lived at Chelsea, in conjunction with John Malony\r\nand Edward Armstrong, two watermen, seized the person of Thomas Lewis,\r\nan African slave, in a dark night, and dragged him to a boat lying in\r\nthe Thames; they then gagged him and tied him with a cord, and rowed him\r\ndown to a ship, and put him on board to be sold as a slave in Jamaica.\r\nThis base action took place near the garden of Mrs. Banks, the mother of\r\nthe late Sir Joseph Banks. Lewis, it appears, on being seized, screamed\r\nviolently. The servants of Mrs. Banks, who heard his cries, ran to his\r\nassistance, but the boat was gone. On informing their mistress of what\r\nhad happened, she sent for Mr. Sharp, who began now to be known as the\r\nfriend of the helpless Africans, and professed her willingness to incur\r\nthe expense of bringing the delinquents to justice. Mr. Sharp, with some\r\ndifficulty, procured a _habeas corpus_, in consequence of which Lewis\r\nwas brought from Gravesend just as the vessel was on the point of\r\nsailing. An action was then commenced against Stapylton, who defended\r\nhimself on the plea, \"That Lewis belonged to him as his slave.\" In the\r\ncourse of the trial, Mr. Dunning, who was counsel for Lewis, paid Mr.\r\nSharp a handsome compliment; for he held in his hand Mr. Sharp's book,\r\non the _Injustice and Dangerous Tendency of Tolerating Slavery in\r\nEngland_, while he was pleading; and in his address to the jury he spoke\r\nand acted thus:--\"I shall submit to you,\" says Mr. Dunning, \"what my\r\nideas are upon such evidence, reserving to myself an opportunity of\r\ndiscussing it more particularly, and reserving to myself a right to\r\ninsist upon a position, which I will maintain (and here he held up the\r\nbook to the notice of those present,) in any place and in any court of\r\nthe kingdom, that our laws admit of no such property[A].\" The result of\r\nthe trial was, that the jury pronounced the plaintiff not to have been\r\nthe property of the defendant, several of them crying out, \"No property,\r\nno property.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It is lamentable to think that the same Mr. Dunning, in a\r\ncause of this kind, which came on afterwards, took the opposite side of\r\nthe question.]\r\n\r\nAfter this one or two other trials came on, in which the oppressor was\r\ndefeated, and several cases occurred in which poor slaves were liberated\r\nfrom the holds of vessels and other places of confinement, by the\r\nexertions of Mr. Sharp. One of these cases was singular. The vessels on\r\nboard which a poor African had been dragged and confined, had reached\r\nthe Downs, and had actually got under weigh for the West Indies: in two\r\nor three hours she would have been out of sight; but just at this\r\ncritical moment the writ of _habeas corpus_ was carried on board. The\r\nofficer who served it on the captain saw the miserable African chained\r\nto the mainmast, bathed in tears, and casting a last mournful look on\r\nthe land of freedom, which was fast receding from his sight. The\r\ncaptain, on receiving the writ, became outrageous; but knowing the\r\nserious consequences of resisting the law of the land, he gave up his\r\nprisoner, whom the officer carried safe, but now crying for joy, to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nBut though the injured Africans, whose causes had been tried, escaped\r\nslavery, and though many who had been forcibly carried into dungeons,\r\nready to be transported into the Colonies, had been delivered out of\r\nthem, Mr. Sharp was not easy in his mind: not one of the cases had yet\r\nbeen pleaded on the broad ground, \"Whether an African slave, coming into\r\nEngland, became free?\" This great question had been hitherto studiously\r\navoided; it was still, therefore, left in doubt. Mr. Sharp was almost\r\ndaily acting as if it had been determined, and as if he had been\r\nfollowing the known law of the land: he wished, therefore, that the next\r\ncause might be argued upon this principle. Lord Mansfield too, who had\r\nbeen biassed by the opinion of York and Talbot, began to waver in\r\nconsequence of the different pleadings he had heard on this subject: he\r\nsaw also no end of trials like these, till the law should be\r\nascertained, and he was anxious for a decision on the same basis as Mr.\r\nSharp. In this situation the following case offered, which was agreed\r\nupon for the determination of this important question.\r\n\r\nJames Somerset, an African slave, had been brought to England by his\r\nmaster, Charles Stewart, in November 1769. Somerset in process of time\r\nleft him. Stewart took an opportunity of seizing him, and had him\r\nconveyed on board the Ann and Mary, Captain Knowles, to be carried out\r\nof the kingdom and sold as a slave in Jamaica: the question was,\r\n\"Whether a slave, by coming into England, became free?\"\r\n\r\nIn order that time might be given for ascertaining the law fully on this\r\nhead, the case was argued at three different sittings. First, in\r\nJanuary, 1772; secondly, in February, 1772; and thirdly, in May, 1772.\r\nAnd that no decision otherwise than what the law warranted might be\r\ngiven, the opinion of the judges was taken upon the pleadings. The great\r\nand glorious result of the trial was, \"That as soon as ever any slave\r\nset his foot upon English territory, he became free.\"\r\n\r\nThus ended the great case of Somerset, which, having, been determined\r\nafter so deliberate an investigation of the law, can never be reversed\r\nwhile the British Constitution remains. The eloquence displayed in it by\r\nthose who were engaged on the side of liberty, was perhaps never\r\nexceeded on any occasion; and the names of the counsellors Davy, Glynn,\r\nHargrave, Mansfield, and Alleyne, ought always to be remembered with\r\ngratitude by the friends of this great cause. For when we consider in\r\nhow many crowded courts they pleaded, and the number of individuals in\r\nthese, whose minds they enlightened, and whose hearts they interested in\r\nthe subject, they are certainly to be put down as no small instruments\r\nin the promotion of it; but chiefly to him, under Divine Providence, are\r\nwe to give the praise, who became the first great actor in it, who\r\ndevoted his time, his talents, and his substance to this Christian\r\nundertaking, and by whose laborious researches the very pleaders\r\nthemselves were instructed and benefited. By means of his almost\r\nincessant vigilance and attention, and unwearied efforts, the poor\r\nAfrican ceased to be hunted in our streets as a beast of prey. Miserable\r\nas the roof might be, under which he slept, he slept in security. He\r\nwalked by the side of the stately ship, and he feared no dungeon in her\r\nhold. Nor ought we, as Englishmen, to be less grateful to this\r\ndistinguished individual than the African ought to be upon this\r\noccasion. To him we owe it, that we no longer see our public papers\r\npolluted by hateful advertisements of the sale of the human species, or\r\nthat we are no longer distressed by the perusal of impious rewards for\r\nbringing back the poor and the helpless into slavery, or that we are\r\nprohibited the disgusting spectacle of seeing man bought by his\r\nfellow-man. To him, in short, we owe this restoration of the beauty of\r\nour constitution--this prevention of the continuance of our national\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nI shall say but little more of Mr. Sharp at present, than that he felt\r\nit his duty, immediately after the trial, to write to Lord North, then\r\nprincipal minister of state, warning him in the most earnest manner, to\r\nabolish immediately both the trade and the slavery of the human species\r\nin all the British dominions, as utterly irreconcileable with the\r\nprinciples of the British constitution, and the established religion of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nAmong other coadjutors, whom the cruel and wicked practices which have\r\nnow been so amply detailed brought forward, was a worthy clergyman,\r\nwhose name I have not yet been able to learn. He endeavoured to interest\r\nthe public feeling in behalf of the injured Africans, by writing an\r\nepilogue to the _Padlock_, in which Mungo appeared as a black servant.\r\nThis epilogue is so appropriate to the case, that I cannot but give it\r\nto the reader. Mungo enters, and thus addresses the audience:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Thank you, my massas! have you laugh your fill?\r\n  Then let me speak, nor take that freedom ill.\r\n  E'en from _my_ tongue some heart-felt truths may fall,\r\n  And outraged Nature claims the care of all.\r\n  My tale in _any_ place would force a tear,\r\n  But calls for stronger, deeper feelings here;\r\n  For whilst I tread the free-born British land,\r\n  Whilst now before me crowded Britons stand,--\r\n  Vain, vain that glorious privilege to me,\r\n  I am a slave, where all things else are free.\r\n\r\n  Yet was I born, as you are, no man's slave,\r\n  An heir to all that liberal Nature gave;\r\n  My mind can reason, and my limbs can move\r\n  The same as yours; like yours my heart can love;\r\n  Alike my body food and sleep sustain;\r\n  And e'en like yours--feels pleasure, want, and pain.\r\n  One sun rolls o'er us, common skies surround;\r\n  One globe supports us, and one grave must bound.\r\n\r\n  Why then am I devoid of all to live\r\n  That manly comforts to a man can give?\r\n\r\n  To live--untaught religion's soothing balm,\r\n  Or life's choice arts; to live--unknown the calm,\r\n  Of soft domestic ease; those sweets of life,\r\n  The duteous offspring, and th' endearing wife?\r\n  To live--to property and rights unknown,\r\n  Not e'en the common benefits my own!\r\n  No arm to guard me from Oppression's rod,\r\n  My will subservient to a tyrant's nod!\r\n  No gentle hand, when life is in decay,\r\n  To soothe my pains, and charm my cares away;\r\n  But helpless left to quit the horrid stage,\r\n  Harassed in youth, and desolate in age!\r\n\r\n  But I was born in Afric's tawny strand,\r\n  And you in fair Britannia's fairer land;\r\n  Comes freedom, then, from colour?--Blush with shame!\r\n  And let strong Nature's crimson mark your blame.\r\n  I speak to Britons.--Britons--then behold\r\n  A man by, Britons _snared_, and _seized_, and _sold!_\r\n  And yet no British statute damns the deed,\r\n  Nor do the more than murderous villains bleed.\r\n\r\n  O sons of Freedom! equalize your laws,\r\n  Be all consistent, plead the negro's cause;\r\n  That all the nations in your code may see\r\n  The British negro, like the Briton, free.\r\n  But, should he supplicate your laws in vain,\r\n  To break, for ever, this disgraceful chain,\r\n  At least, let gentle usage so abate\r\n  The galling terrors of its passing state,\r\n  That he may share kind Heaven's all social plan;\r\n  For, though no Briton, Mungo is--a man.\r\n\r\nI may now add, that few theatrical pieces had a greater run than the\r\n_Padlock_; and that this epilogue, which was attached to it soon after\r\nit came out, procured a good deal of feeling for the unfortunate\r\nsufferers, whose cause it was intended to serve.\r\n\r\nAnother coadjutor, to whom these cruel and wicked practices gave birth,\r\nwas Thomas Day, the celebrated author of _Sandford and Merton_, and\r\nwhose virtues were well known among those who had the happiness of his\r\nfriendship. In the year 1773 he published a poem, which he wrote\r\nexpressly in behalf of the oppressed Africans. He gave it the name of\r\n_The Dying Negro._ The preface to it was written in an able manner by\r\nhis friend Counsellor Bicknell, who is therefore to be ranked among the\r\ncoadjutors in this great cause. The poem was founded on a simple fact,\r\nwhich had taken place a year or two before. A poor negro had been seized\r\nin London, and forcibly put on board a ship, where he destroyed himself,\r\nrather than return to the land of slavery. To the poem is affixed a\r\nfrontispiece, in which the negro is represented. He is made to stand in\r\nan attitude of the most earnest address to heaven, in the course of\r\nwhich, with the fatal dagger in his hand, he breaks forth in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n  To you this unpolluted blood I pour,\r\n  To you that spirit, which ye gave, restore.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis poem, which was the first ever written expressly on the subject,\r\nwas read extensively; and it added to the sympathy in favour of\r\nsuffering humanity, which was now beginning to show itself in the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the first edition of the _Essay an Truth_ made its\r\nappearance in the world. Dr. Beattie took an opportunity, in this work,\r\nof vindicating the intellectual powers of the Africans from the\r\naspersions of Hume, and of condemning their slavery as a barbarous piece\r\nof policy, and as inconsistent with the free and generous spirit of the\r\nBritish nation.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1774, John Wesley, the celebrated divine, to whose pious\r\nlabours the religious world will long be indebted, undertook the cause\r\nof the poor Africans. He had been in America, and had seen and pitied\r\ntheir hard condition. The work which he gave to the world in\r\nconsequence, was entitled _Thoughts on Slavery_. Mr. Wesley had this\r\ngreat cause much at heart, and frequently recommended it to the support\r\nof those who attended his useful ministry.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1776, the Abbé Proyart brought out, at Paris, his _History\r\nof Loango_, and other kingdoms in Africa, in which he did ample justice\r\nto the moral and intellectual character of the natives there.\r\n\r\nThe same year produced two new friends in England, in the same cause,\r\nbut in a line in which no one had yet moved. David Hartley, then a\r\nmember of parliament for Hull, and the son of Dr. Hartley who wrote the\r\n_Essay on Man_, found it impossible any longer to pass over without\r\nnotice the case of the oppressed Africans. He had long felt for their\r\nwretched condition, and, availing himself of his legislative situation,\r\nhe made a motion in the House of Commons, \"That the Slave Trade was\r\ncontrary to the laws of God, and the rights of men.\" In order that he\r\nmight interest the members as much as possible in his motion, he had\r\npreviously obtained some of the chains in use in this cruel traffic, and\r\nhad laid them upon the table of the House of Commons. His motion was\r\nseconded by that great patriot and philanthropist, Sir George Saville.\r\nBut though I am now to state that it failed, I cannot but consider it as\r\na matter of pleasing reflection, that this great subject was first\r\nintroduced into parliament by those who were worthy of it; by those who\r\nhad clean hands and an irreproachable character, and to whom no motive\r\nof party or faction could be imputed, but only such as must have arisen\r\nfrom a love of justice, a true feeling of humanity, and a proper sense\r\nof religion.\r\n\r\nAbout this time two others, men of great talents and learning, promoted\r\nthe cause of the injured Africans, by the manner in which they\r\nintroduced them to notice in their respective works.\r\n\r\nDr. Adam Smith, in his _Theory of Moral Sentiments_, had, so early as\r\nthe year 1759, held them up in an honourable, and their tyrants in a\r\ndegrading light. \"There is not a Negro from the coast of Africa, who\r\ndoes not, in this respect, possess a degree of magnanimity which the\r\nsoul of his sordid master is too often scarce capable of conceiving.\r\nFortune never exerted more cruelly her empire over mankind, than when\r\nshe subjected those nations of heroes to the refuse of the gaols of\r\nEurope, to wretches who possess the virtue neither of the countries they\r\ncame from, nor of those they go to, and whose levity, brutality, and\r\nbaseness so justly expose them to the contempt of the vanquished.\" And\r\nnow, in 1776, in his _Wealth of Nations_ he showed in a forcible manner\r\n(for he appealed to the interest of those concerned,) the dearness of\r\nAfrican labour; or the impolicy of employing slaves.\r\n\r\nProfessor Millar, in his _Origin of Ranks_, followed Dr. Smith on the\r\nsame ground. He explained the impolicy of slavery in general, by its bad\r\neffects upon industry, population, and morals. These effects he attached\r\nto the system of agriculture as followed in our islands. He showed,\r\nbesides, how little pains were taken, or how few contrivances were\r\nthought of, to ease the labourers there. He contended that the Africans\r\nought to be better treated, and to be raised to a better condition; and\r\nhe ridiculed the inconsistency of those who held them in bondage. \"It\r\naffords,\" says he, \"a curious spectacle to observe that the same people,\r\nwho talk in a high strain of political liberty, and who consider the\r\nprivilege of imposing their own taxes as one of the unalienable rights\r\nof mankind, should make no scruple of reducing a great proportion of\r\ntheir fellow-creatures into circumstances by which they are not only\r\ndeprived of property, but almost of every species of right. Fortune,\r\nperhaps, never produced a situation more calculated to ridicule a\r\nliberal hypothesis, or to show how little the conduct of men is at the\r\nbottom directed by any philosophical principles.\" It is a great honour\r\nto the University of Glasgow, that it should have produced, before any\r\npublic agitation of this question, three professors[A], all of whom bore\r\ntheir public testimony against the continuance of the cruel trade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The other was Professor Hutcheson, before mentioned in p.\r\n56.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time, or from about the year 1776, to about the year 1782, I\r\nam to put down three other coadjutors, whose labours seem to have come\r\nin a right season for the promotion of the cause.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was Dr. ROBERTSON. In his _History of America_ he\r\nlaid open many facts relative to this subject. He showed himself a warm\r\nfriend both of the Indians and Africans. He lost no opportunity of\r\ncondemning that trade, which brought the latter into bondage: \"a trade,\"\r\nsays he, \"which is no less repugnant to the feelings of humanity than to\r\nthe principles of religion.\" And in his _Charles the Fifth_, he showed\r\nin a manner that was clear, and never to be controverted, that\r\nChristianity was the great cause in the twelfth century of extirpating\r\nslavery from the west of Europe. By the establishment of this fact, he\r\nrendered important services to the oppressed Africans. For if\r\nChristianity, when it began to be felt in the heart, dictated the\r\nabolition of slavery, it certainly became those who lived in a Christian\r\ncountry, and who professed the Christian religion, to put an end to this\r\ncruel trade.\r\n\r\nThe second was the Abbé Raynal. This author gave an account of the laws,\r\ngovernment, and religion of Africa, of the produce of it, of the manners\r\nof its inhabitants, of the trade in slaves, of the manner of procuring\r\nthese, with several other particulars relating to the subject. And at\r\nthe end of his account, fearing lest the good advice he had given for\r\nmaking the condition of the slaves more comfortable should be construed\r\ninto an approbation of such a traffic, he employed several pages in\r\nshowing its utter inconsistency with sound policy, justice, reason,\r\nhumanity, and religion.\r\n\r\n\"I will not here,\" says he, \"so far debase myself as to enlarge the\r\nignominious list of those writers who devote their abilities to justify\r\nby policy what morality condemns. In an age where so many errors are\r\nboldly laid open, it would be unpardonable to conceal any truth that is\r\ninteresting to humanity. If whatever I have hitherto advanced hath\r\nseemingly tended only to alleviate the burden of slavery, the reason is,\r\nthat it was first necessary to give some comfort to those unhappy beings\r\nwhom we cannot set free, and convince their oppressors that they were\r\ncruel, to the prejudice of their real interests. But, in the mean time,\r\ntill some considerable revolution shall make the evidence of this great\r\ntruth felt, it may not be improper to pursue this subject further. I\r\nshall then first prove that there is no reason of state which can\r\nauthorize slavery. I shall not be afraid to cite to the tribunal of\r\nreason and justice those governments which tolerate this cruelty, or\r\nwhich even are not ashamed to make it the basis of their power.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a little further on he observes--\"Will it be said that he, who wants\r\nto make me a slave, does me no injury; but that he only makes use of his\r\nrights? Where are those rights? Who hath stamped upon them so sacred a\r\ncharacter as to silence mine?\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the next paragraph he speaks thus:--\"He who supports\r\nthe system of slavery is the enemy of the whole human race. He divides\r\nit into two societies of legal assassins; the oppressors, and the\r\noppressed. It is the same thing as proclaiming to the world, if you\r\nwould preserve your life, instantly take away mine, for I want to have\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\nGoing on two pages further, we find these words:--\"But the Negroes, they\r\nsay, are a race born for slavery; their dispositions are narrow,\r\ntreacherous, and wicked; they themselves allow the superiority of our\r\nunderstandings, and almost acknowledge the justice of our authority.\r\nYes; the minds of the Negroes are contracted, because slavery destroys\r\nall the springs of the soul. They are wicked, but not equally so with\r\nyou. They are treacherous, because they are under no obligation to speak\r\ntruth to their tyrants. They acknowledge the superiority of our\r\nunderstanding, because we have abused their ignorance. They allow the\r\njustice of our authority, because we have abused their weakness.\"\r\n\r\n\"But these Negroes, it is further urged, were born slaves. Barbarians!\r\nwill you persuade me that a man can be the property of a sovereign, a\r\nson the property of a father, a wife the property of a husband, a\r\ndomestic the property of a master, a Negro the property of a planter?\"\r\n\r\nBut I have no time to follow this animated author, even by short\r\nextracts, through the varied strains of eloquence which he displays upon\r\nthis occasion. I can only say that his labours entitle him to a high\r\nstation among the benefactors to the African race.\r\n\r\nThe third was Dr. PALEY, whose genius, talents, and learning have been\r\nso eminently displayed in his writings in the cause of natural and\r\nrevealed religion. Dr. Paley did not write any essay expressly in favour\r\nof the Africans. But in his _Moral Philosophy_, where he treated on\r\nslavery, he took an opportunity of condemning, in very severe terms, the\r\ncontinuance of it. In this work he defined what slavery was, and how it\r\nmight arise consistently with the law of nature; but he made an\r\nexception against that which arose from the African trade. \"The Slave\r\nTrade,\" says he, \"upon the coast of Africa, is not excused by these\r\nprinciples. When slaves in that country are brought to market, no\r\nquestions, I believe, are asked about the origin or justice of the\r\nvendor's title. It may be presumed, therefore, that this title is not\r\nalways, if it be ever, founded in any of the causes above assigned.\r\n\r\n\"But defect of right in the first purchase is the least crime with which\r\nthis traffic is chargeable. The natives are excited to war and mutual\r\ndepredation, for the sake of supplying their contracts, or furnishing\r\nthe markets with slaves. With this the wickedness begins. The slaves,\r\ntorn away from their parents, wives, and children, from their friends\r\nand companions, from their fields and flocks, from their home and\r\ncountry, are transported to the European settlements in America, with no\r\nother accommodation on ship-board than what is provided for brutes. This\r\nis the second stage of the cruelty, from which the miserable exiles are\r\ndelivered, only to be placed, and that for life, in subjection to a\r\ndominion add system of laws, the most merciless and tyrannical that ever\r\nwere tolerated upon the face of the earth: and from all that can be\r\nlearned by the accounts of people upon the spot, the inordinate\r\nauthority which the plantation-laws confer upon the slaveholder is\r\nexercised, by the English slaveholder especially, with rigour and\r\nbrutality.\r\n\r\n\"But necessity is pretended, the name under which every enormity is\r\nattempted to be justified; and after all, what is the necessity? It has\r\nnever been proved that the land could not be cultivated there, as it is\r\nhere, by hired servants. It is said, that it could not be cultivated\r\nwith quite the same conveniency and cheapness, as by the labour of\r\nslaves; by which means, a pound of sugar, which the planter now sells\r\nfor sixpence, could not be afforded under sixpence-halfpenny--and this\r\nis the necessity!\r\n\r\n\"The great revolution which has taken place in the western world, may,\r\nprobably, conduce (and who knows but that it was designed) to accelerate\r\nthe fall of this abominable tyranny: and now that this contest and the\r\npassions which attend it are no more, there may succeed, perhaps, a\r\nseason for reflecting, whether a legislature, which had so long lent its\r\nassistance to the support of an institution replete with human misery,\r\nwas fit to be trusted with an empire, the most extensive that ever\r\nobtained in any age or quarter of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of these sentiments may be supposed to have produced an\r\nextensive effect. For _The Moral Philosophy_ was adopted early by some\r\nof the colleges in our universities into the system of their education.\r\nIt soon found its way also into most of the private libraries of the\r\nkingdom; and it was, besides, generally read and approved. Dr. Paley,\r\ntherefore, must be considered, as having been a considerable coadjutor\r\nin interesting the mind of the public in favour of the oppressed\r\nAfricans.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1783, we find Mr. Sharp coming again into notice. We find\r\nhim at this time taking a part in a cause, the knowledge of which, in\r\nproportion as it was disseminated, produced an earnest desire among all\r\ndisinterested persons for the abolition of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nIn this year, certain underwriters desired to be heard against Gregson\r\nand others of Liverpool, in the case of the ship Zong, Captain\r\nCollingwood, alleging that the captain and officers of the said vessel\r\nthrew overboard one hundred and thirty-two slaves alive into the seas in\r\norder to defraud them, by claiming the value of the said slaves, as if\r\nthey had been lost in a natural way. In the course of the trial which\r\nafterwards came on, it appeared, that the slaves on board the Zong were\r\nvery sickly; that sixty of them had already died; and several were ill\r\nand likely to die, when the captain proposed to James Kelsall, the mate,\r\nand others, to throw several of them overboard, stating, \"that if they\r\ndied a natural death, the loss would fall upon the owners of the ship;\r\nbut that if they were thrown into the sea, it would fall upon the\r\nunderwriters.\" He selected, accordingly, one hundred and thirty-two of\r\nthe most sickly of the slaves. Fifty-four of these were immediately\r\nthrown overboard, and forty-two were made to be partakers of their fate\r\non the succeeding day. In the course of three days afterwards the\r\nremaining twenty-six were brought upon deck to complete the number of\r\nvictims. The first sixteen submitted to be thrown into the sea; but the\r\nrest, with a noble resolution, would not suffer the officers to touch\r\nthem, but leaped after their companions and shared their fate.\r\n\r\nThe plea which was set up in behalf of this atrocious and unparalleled\r\nact of wickedness was, that the captain discovered, when he made the\r\nproposal, that he had only two hundred gallons of water on board, and\r\nthat he had missed his port. It was proved, however, in answer to this,\r\nthat no one had been put upon short allowance; and that, as if\r\nProvidence had determined to afford an unequivocal proof of the guilt, a\r\nshower of rain fell and continued for three days immediately after the\r\nsecond lot of slaves had been destroyed, by means of which they might\r\nhave filled many of their vessels[A] with water, and thus have prevented\r\nall necessity for the destruction of the third.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It appeared that they filled six.]\r\n\r\nMr. Sharp was present at this trial, and procured the attendance of a\r\nshort-hand writer to take down the facts, which should come out in the\r\ncourse of it. These he gave to the public afterwards. He communicated\r\nthem also, with a copy of the trial, to the Lords of the Admiralty, as\r\nthe guardians of justice upon the seas, and to the Duke of Portland, as\r\nprincipal minister of state. No notice, however, was taken by any of\r\nthese, of the information which had been thus sent them.\r\n\r\nBut though nothing was done by the persons then in power, in consequence\r\nof the murder of so many innocent individuals, yet the publication of an\r\naccount of it by Mr. Sharp, in the newspapers, made such an impression\r\nupon others, that; new coadjutors rose up. For, soon after this, we find\r\nThomas Day entering the lists again as the champion of the injured\r\nAfricans. He had lived to see his poem of _The Dying Negro_, which had\r\nbeen published in 1773, make a considerable impression. In 1776, he had\r\nwritten a letter to a friend in America, who was the possessor of\r\nslaves, to dissuade him by a number of arguments from holding such\r\nproperty; and now, when the knowledge of the case of the ship Zong was\r\nspreading, he published that letter under the title of Fragment of an\r\nOriginal Letter on the Slavery of the Negroes.\r\n\r\nIn this same year, Dr. Porteus, Bishop of Chester, but now Bishop of\r\nLondon, came forward as a new advocate for the natives of Africa. The\r\nway in which he rendered them service, was by preaching a sermon in\r\ntheir behalf, before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Of\r\nthe wide circulation of this sermon, I shall say something in another\r\nplace, but much more of the enlightened and pious author of it, who from\r\nthis time never failed to aid, at every opportunity, the cause which he\r\nhad so ably undertaken.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1784, Dr. GREGORY produced his _Essays, Historical and\r\nMoral_. He took an opportunity of disseminating in these a\r\ncircumstantial knowledge of the Slave Trade, and an equal abhorrence of\r\nit at the same time. He explained the manner of procuring slaves in\r\nAfrica; the treatment of them on the passage, (in which he mentioned the\r\ncase of the ship Zong) and the wicked and cruel treatment of them in the\r\ncolonies. He recited and refuted also the various arguments adduced in\r\ndefence of the trade. He showed that it was destructive to our seamen.\r\nHe produced many weighty arguments also against the slavery itself. He\r\nproposed clauses for an Act of Parliament for the abolition of both;\r\nshowing the good both to England and her colonies from such a measure,\r\nand that a trade might be substituted in Africa, in various articles,\r\nfor that which he proposed to suppress. By means of the diffusion of\r\nlight like this, both of a moral and political nature; Dr. Gregory is\r\nentitled to be ranked among the benefactors to the African race.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, Gilbert Wakefield preached a sermon at Richmond, in\r\nSurrey, where, speaking of the people of this nation, he says, \"Have we\r\nbeen as renowned for a liberal communication of our religion and our\r\nlaws as for the possession of them! Have we navigated and conquered to\r\nsave, to civilize, and to instruct; or to oppress, to plunder, and to\r\ndestroy? Let India and Africa give the answer to these questions. The\r\none we have exhausted of her wealth and her inhabitants by violence, by\r\nfamine, and by every species of tyranny and murder. The children of the\r\nother we daily carry from off the land of their nativity; like sheep to\r\nthe slaughter, to return no more. We tear them from every object of\r\ntheir affection, or, sad alternative, drag them together to the horrors\r\nof a mutual servitude! We keep them in the profoundest ignorance. We\r\ngall them in a tenfold chain, with an unrelenting spirit of barbarity,\r\ninconceivable to all but the spectators of it, unexampled among former\r\nand other nations, and unrecorded even in the bloody registers of\r\nheathen persecution. Such is the conduct of us enlightened Englishmen,\r\nreformed Christians! Thus have we profited by our superior advantages,\r\nby the favour of God, by the doctrines and example of a meek and lowly\r\nSavior. Will not the blessings which we have abused loudly testify\r\nagainst us? Will not the blood which we have shed cry from the ground\r\nfor vengeance upon our sins?\"\r\n\r\nIn the same year, James Ramsay, vicar of Teston in Kent, became also an\r\nable, zealous, and indefatigable patron of the African cause. This\r\ngentleman had resided nineteen years in the island of St. Christopher,\r\nwhere he had observed the treatment of the slaves, and had studied the\r\nlaws relating to them. On his return to England, yielding to his own\r\nfeelings of duty and the solicitations of some amiable friends, he\r\npublished a work, which he called _An Essay on the Treatment and\r\nConversion of the African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies_. After\r\nhaving given an account of the relative situation of master and slave in\r\nvarious parts of the world, he explained the low and degrading situation\r\nwhich the Africans held in society in our own islands. He showed that\r\ntheir importance would be increased; and the temporal interest of their\r\nmasters promoted, by giving them freedom, and by granting them other\r\nprivileges. He showed the great difficulty of instructing them in the\r\nstate in which they then were, and such as he himself had experienced,\r\nboth in his private and public attempts, and such as others had\r\nexperienced also. He stated the way in which private attempts of this\r\nnature might probably be successful. He then answered all objections\r\nagainst their capacities, as drawn from philosophy, form, anatomy, and\r\nobservation; and vindicated these from his own experience. And lastly,\r\nhe threw out ideas for the improvement of their condition, by an\r\nestablishment of a greater number of spiritual pastors among them; by\r\ngiving them more privileges than they then possessed; and by extending\r\ntowards them the benefits of a proper police. Mr. Ramsay had no other\r\nmotive for giving this work to the public, than that of humanity, of a\r\nwish to serve this much-injured part of the human species. For he\r\ncompiled it at the hazard of forfeiting that friendship, which he had\r\ncontracted with many during his residence in the islands, and of\r\nsuffering much in his private property, as well as subjecting himself to\r\nthe ill-will and persecution of numerous individuals.\r\n\r\nThe publication of this book by one who professed to have been so long\r\nresident in the islands, and to have been an eyewitness of facts,\r\nproduced, as may easily be supposed, a good deal of conversation, and\r\nmade a considerable impression, but particularly at this time, when a\r\nstorm was visibly gathering over the heads of the oppressors of the\r\nAfrican race. These circumstances occasioned one or two persons to\r\nattempt to answer it, and these answers brought Mr. Ramsay into the\r\nfirst controversy ever entered into on this subject, during which, as is\r\nthe case in most controversies, the cause of truth was spread.\r\n\r\nThe works which Mr. Ramsay wrote upon this subject were, the essay just\r\nmentioned, in 1784. _An Inquiry_, also, _into the Effects of the\r\nAbolition of the Slave Trade_, in 1784; _A Reply to Personal Invectives\r\nand Objections_, in 1785; _A Letter to James Tobin, Esq._, in 1787;\r\n_Objections to the Abolition of the Slave Trade, with Answers_; and _An\r\nExamination of Harris's Scriptural Researches on the Licitness of the\r\nSlave Trade_, in 1788; and _An Address on the proposed Bill for the\r\nAbolition of the Slave Trade_, in 1789. In short, from the time when he\r\nfirst took up the cause, he was engaged in it till his death, which was\r\nnot a little accelerated by his exertions. He lived, however, to see\r\nthis cause in a train of parliamentary inquiry, and he died satisfied;\r\nbeing convinced, as he often expressed, that the investigation must\r\ninevitably lead to the total abolition of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nIn the next year, that is, in the year 1785, another advocate was seen\r\nin Monsieur Necker, in his celebrated work on the _French Finances_,\r\nwhich had just been translated into the English language from the\r\noriginal work, in 1784. This virtuous statesman, after having given his\r\nestimate of the population and revenue of the French West Indian\r\ncolonies, proceeds thus:--\"The colonies of France contain, as we have\r\nseen, near five hundred thousand slaves, and it is from the number of\r\nthese poor wretches that the inhabitants set a value on their\r\nplantations. What a dreadful prospect! and how profound a subject for\r\nreflection! Alas! how little are we both in our morality and our\r\nprinciples! We preach up humanity, and yet go every year to bind in\r\nchains twenty thousand natives of Africa! We call the Moors barbarians\r\nand ruffians, because they attack the liberty of Europeans at the risk\r\nof their own; yet these Europeans go, without danger, and as mere\r\nspeculators, to purchase slaves by gratifying the avarice of their\r\nmasters, and excite all those bloody scenes which are the usual\r\npreliminaries of this traffic!\" He goes on still further in the same\r\nstrain. He then shows the kind of power which has supported this\r\nexecrable trade. He throws out the idea of a general compact, by which\r\nall the European nations should agree to abolish it; and he indulges the\r\npleasing hope that it may take place even in the present generation.\r\n\r\nIn the same year we find other coadjutors coming before our view, but\r\nthese in a line different from that in which any other belonging to this\r\nclass had yet moved. Mr. George White, a clergyman of the established\r\nchurch, and Mr. John Chubb, suggested to Mr. William Tucket, the mayor\r\nof Bridgewater, where they resided, and to others of that town, the\r\npropriety of petitioning parliament for the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade. This petition was agreed upon, and, when drawn up, was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"The humble petition of the inhabitants of Bridgewater showeth,\r\n\r\n\"That your petitioners, reflecting with the deepest sensibility on the\r\ndeplorable condition of that part of the human species, the African\r\nNegroes, who, by the most flagitious means, are reduced to slavery and\r\nmisery in the British colonies, beg leave to address this honourable\r\nhouse in their behalf, and to express a just abhorrence of a system of\r\noppression, which no prospect of private gain, no consideration of\r\npublic advantage, no plea of political expediency, can sufficiently\r\njustify or excuse.\r\n\r\n\"That, satisfied as your petitioners are that this inhuman system meets\r\nwith the general execration of mankind, they flatter themselves the day\r\nis not far distant when it will be universally abolished. And they most\r\nardently hope to see a British parliament, by the extinction of that\r\nsanguinary traffic, extend the blessings of liberty to millions beyond\r\nthis realm, held up to an enlightened world a glorious and merciful\r\nexample, and stand in the defence of the violated rights of human\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nThis petition was presented by the Honourable Ann Poulet, and Alexander\r\nHood, Esq., (afterwards Lord Bridport,) who were the members for the\r\ntown of Bridgewater. It was ordered to lie on the table. The answer\r\nwhich these gentlemen gave to their constituents relative to the\r\nreception of it in the House of Commons is worthy of notice:--\"There did\r\nnot appear,\" say they in their common letter, \"the least disposition to\r\npay any further attention to it. Every one almost says that the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade must immediately throw the West Indian\r\nislands into convulsions, and soon complete their utter ruin. Thus they\r\nwill not trust Providence for its protection for so pious an\r\nundertaking.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1786, Captain J.S. Smith, of the royal navy, offered himself\r\nto the notice of the public in behalf of the African cause. Mr. Ramsay,\r\nas I have observed before, had become involved in a controversy in\r\nconsequence of his support of it. His opponents not only attacked his\r\nreputation, but had the effrontery to deny his facts. This circumstance\r\noccasioned Captain Smith to come forward. He wrote a letter to his\r\nfriend Mr. Hill, in which he stated that he had seen those things, while\r\nin the West Indies, which Mr. Ramsay had asserted to exist, but which\r\nhad been so boldly denied. He gave, also, permission to Mr. Hill to\r\npublish this letter. Too much praise cannot be bestowed on Captain\r\nSmith, for thus standing forth in a noble cause, and in behalf of an\r\ninjured character.\r\n\r\nThe last of the necessary forerunners and coadjutors of this class, whom\r\nI am to mention, was our much-admired poet, Cowper; and a great\r\ncoadjutor he was, when we consider what value was put upon his\r\nsentiments, and the extraordinary circulation of his works. There are\r\nfew persons who have not been properly impressed by the following\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     My ear is pain'd,\r\n  My soul is sick with every day's report,\r\n  Of wrong and outrage with which earth is fill'd.\r\n  There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart,\r\n  It does not feel for man. The natural bond\r\n  Of brotherhood is sever'd as the flax\r\n  That falls asunder at the touch of fire.\r\n  He finds his fellow guilty of a skin\r\n  Not colour'd like his own, and having power\r\n  To inforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause\r\n  Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.\r\n  Lands intersected by a narrow frith\r\n  Abhor each other. Mountains interpos'd,\r\n  Make enemies of nations, who had else,\r\n  Like kindred drops been mingled into one.\r\n  Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys;\r\n  And, worse than all, and most to be deplored\r\n  As human Nature's broadest, foulest blot,--\r\n  Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat\r\n  With stripes, that Mercy with a bleeding heart\r\n  Weeps, when she sees inflicted on a beast.\r\n  Then what is man? And what man, seeing this,\r\n  And having human feelings, does not blush\r\n  And hang his head to think himself a man?\r\n  I would not have a slave to till my ground,\r\n  To carry me, to fan me while I sleep,\r\n  And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth\r\n  That sinews bought and sold have ever earn'd.\r\n  No: dear as freedom is,--and in my heart's\r\n  Just estimation prized above all price,--\r\n  I had much rather be myself the slave,\r\n  And wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.\r\n  We have no slaves at home--then why abroad?\r\n  And they themselves once ferried o'er the wave\r\n  That parts us, are emancipate and loos'd.\r\n  Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs\r\n  Receive our air, that moment they are free;\r\n  They touch our country, and their shackles fall[A].\r\n  That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud\r\n  And jealous of the blessing. Spread it, then,\r\n  And let it circulate through every vein\r\n  Of all your empire--that where Britain's power\r\n  Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Expressions used in the great trial, when Mr. Sharp\r\nobtained the verdict in favour of Somerset.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n--Second class of forerunners and coadjutors, up to May 1787,\r\nconsists of the Quakers in England.--Of George Fox and others.--Of the\r\nbody of the Quakers assembled at the yearly meeting in 1727; and at\r\nvarious other times.--Quakers, as a body, petition Parliament; and\r\ncirculate books on the subject.--Individuals among them become labourers\r\nand associate in behalf of the Africans; Dilwyn, Harrison, and\r\nothers.--This the first association ever formed in England for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second class of the forerunners and coadjutors in this great cause,\r\nup to May 1787, will consist of the Quakers in England.\r\n\r\nThe first of this class was George Fox, the venerable founder of this\r\nbenevolent society.\r\n\r\nGeorge Fox was contemporary with Richard Baxter, being born not long\r\nafter him, and dying much about the same time. Like him, he left his\r\ntestimony against this wicked trade. When he was in the island of\r\nBarbados, in the year 1671, he delivered himself to those who attended\r\nhis religious meetings in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n\"Consider with yourselves,\" says he, \"if you were in the same condition\r\nas the poor Africans are--who came strangers to you, and were sold to\r\nyou as slaves--I say, if this should be the condition of you or yours,\r\nyou would think it a hard measure; yea, and very great bondage and\r\ncruelty. And, therefore, consider seriously of this; and do you for them\r\nand to them, as you would willingly have them, or any others, do unto\r\nyou, were you in the like slavish condition, and bring them to know the\r\nLord Christ.\" And in his Journal, speaking of the advice which he gave\r\nhis friends at Barbados, he says, \"I desired also that they would cause\r\ntheir overseers to deal mildly and gently with their negroes, and not to\r\nuse cruelty towards them, as the manner of some had been, and that after\r\ncertain years of servitude they should make them free.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Edmundson, who was a minister of the society, and, indeed, a\r\nfellow-traveller with George Fox, had the boldness in the same island to\r\ndeliver his sentiments to the governor on the same subject. Having been\r\nbrought before him and accused of making the Africans Christians, or, in\r\nother words, of making them rebel and destroy their owners, he replied,\r\n\"That it was a good thing to bring them to the knowledge of God and\r\nChrist Jesus, and to believe in him who died for them and all men, and\r\nthat this would keep them from rebelling, or cutting any person's\r\nthroat; but if they did rebel and cut their throats, as the governor\r\ninsinuated they would, it would be their own doing, in keeping them in\r\nignorance and under oppression, in giving them liberty to be common with\r\nwomen like brutes, and, on the other hand, in starving them for want of\r\nmeat and clothes convenient; thus, giving them liberty in that which God\r\nrestrained, and restraining them in that which was meat and clothing.\"\r\n\r\nI do not find any individual of this society moving in this cause, for\r\nsome time after the death of George Fox and William Edmundson. The first\r\ncircumstance of moment which I discover, is a resolution of the whole\r\nSociety on the subject, at their yearly meeting, held in London in the\r\nyear 1727. The resolution was contained in the following words:--\"It is\r\nthe sense of this meeting, that the importing of negroes from their\r\nnative country and relations by Friends is not a commendable nor allowed\r\npractice, and is, therefore, censured by this meeting.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1758, the Quakers thought it their duty, as a body, to pass\r\nanother resolution upon this subject. At this, time the nature of the\r\ntrade beginning to be better known, we find them more animated upon it,\r\nas the following extract will show:--\r\n\r\n\"We fervently warn all in profession with us, that they carefully avoid\r\nbeing any way concerned in reaping the unrighteous profits, arising from\r\nthe iniquitous practice of dealing in negro or other slaves; whereby, in\r\nthe original purchase, one man selleth another, as he doth the beasts\r\nthat perish, without any better pretension to a property in him than\r\nthat of superior force; in direct violation of the Gospel rule, which\r\nteacheth all to do as they would be done by, and to do good to all;\r\nbeing the reverse of that covetous disposition, which furnisheth\r\nencouragement to those poor ignorant people to perpetuate their savage\r\nwars, in order to supply the demands of this most unnatural traffic, by\r\nwhich great numbers of mankind, free by nature, are subject to\r\ninextricable bondage, and which hath often been observed to fill their\r\npossessors with haughtiness, tyranny, luxury, and barbarity, corrupting\r\nthe minds and debasing the morals of their children, to the unspeakable\r\nprejudice of religion and virtue, and the exclusion of that holy spirit\r\nof universal love, meekness, and charity, which is the unchangeable\r\nnature and the glory of true Christianity. We, therefore, can do no\r\nless, than, with the greatest earnestness, impress it upon Friends\r\neverywhere, that they endeavour to keep their hands clear of this\r\nunrighteous gain of oppression.\"\r\n\r\nThe Quakers hitherto, as appears by the two resolutions which have been\r\nquoted, did nothing more than seriously warn all those in religious\r\nprofession with them against being concerned in this trade. But in three\r\nyears afterwards, or at the yearly meeting in 1761, they came to a\r\nresolution, as we find by the following extract from their minutes, that\r\nany of their members haying a concern in it should be disowned:--\"This\r\nmeeting having reason to apprehend that divers under our name, are\r\nconcerned in the unchristian traffic in negroes, doth recommend it\r\nearnestly to the care of Friends everywhere, to discourage, as much as\r\nin them lies, a practice so repugnant to our Christian profession; and\r\nto deal with all such as shall persevere in a conduct so reproachful to\r\nChristianity; and to disown them, if they desist not therefrom.\"\r\n\r\nThe yearly meeting of 1761, having thus agreed to exclude from\r\nmembership such as should be found concerned in this trade, that of 1763\r\nendeavoured to draw the cords, still tighter, by attaching criminality\r\nto those who should aid and abet the trade in any manner. By the minute,\r\nwhich was made on this occasion, I apprehend that no one belonging to\r\nthe Society could furnish even materials for such voyages. \"We renew our\r\nexhortation, that Friends everywhere be especially careful to keep their\r\nhands clear of giving encouragement in any shape to the Slave Trade, it\r\nbeing evidently destructive of the natural rights of mankind, who are\r\nall ransomed by one Saviour, and visited by one divine light, in order\r\nto salvation; a traffic calculated to enrich and aggrandize some upon\r\nthe misery of others; in its nature abhorrent to every just and tender\r\nsentiment, and contrary to the whole tenour of the Gospel.\"\r\n\r\nSome pleasing intelligence having been sent on this subject, by the\r\nSociety in America to the Society in England, the yearly meeting of 1772\r\nthought it their duty to notice it, and to keep their former resolutions\r\nalive by the following minute:--\"It appears that the practice of holding\r\nnegroes in oppressive and unnatural bondage hath been so successfully\r\ndiscouraged by Friends in some of the colonies, as to be considerably\r\nlessened. We cannot but approve of these salutary endeavours, and\r\nearnestly intreat that they may be continued, that through the favour of\r\ndivine Providence a traffic, so unmerciful and unjust in its nature to a\r\npart of our own species made, equally with ourselves, for immortality,\r\nmay come to be considered by all in its proper light, and be utterly\r\nabolished as a reproach to the Christian name.\"\r\n\r\nI must beg leave to stop here for a moment, just to pay the Quakers a\r\ndue tribute of respect for the proper estimation, in which they have\r\nuniformly held the miserable outcasts of society, who have been the\r\nsubject of these minutes. What a contrast does it afford to the\r\nsentiments of many others concerning them! How have we been compelled to\r\nprove by a long chain of evidence, that they had the same feelings and\r\ncapacities as ourselves! How many, professing themselves enlightened,\r\neven now view them as of a different species! But in the minutes which\r\nhave been cited we have seen them uniformly represented, as persons\r\n\"ransomed by one and the same Saviour,\" \"as visited by one and the same\r\nlight for salvation,\" and \"as made equally for immortality as others.\"\r\nThese practical views of mankind, as they are highly honourable to the\r\nmembers of this Society, so they afford a proof both of the reality and\r\nof the consistency of their religion.\r\n\r\nBut to return:--From this time, there appears to have been a growing\r\ndesire in this benevolent society to step out of its ordinary course in\r\nbehalf of this injured people. It had hitherto confined itself to the\r\nkeeping of its own members unpolluted by any gain from their oppression.\r\nBut it was now ready to make an appeal to others, and to bear a more\r\npublic testimony in their favour. Accordingly, in the month of June,\r\n1783, when a bill had been brought into the House of Commons for certain\r\nregulations to be made with respect to the African Trade, the society\r\nsent the following petition to that branch of the legislature:--\r\n\r\n\"Your petitioners, met in this their annual assembly, having solemnly\r\nconsidered the state of the enslaved negroes, conceive themselves\r\nengaged, in religious duty, to lay the suffering situation of that\r\nunhappy people before you, as a subject loudly calling for the humane\r\ninterposition of the legislature,\r\n\r\n\"Your petitioners regret that a nation, professing the Christian faith,\r\nshould so far counteract the principles of humanity and justice, as by\r\nthe cruel treatment of this oppressed race to fill their minds with\r\nprejudices against the mild and beneficent doctrines of the gospel.\r\n\r\n\"Under the countenance of the laws of this country, many thousand of\r\nthese our fellow-creatures, entitled to the natural rights of mankind,\r\nare held as personal property in cruel bondage; and your petitioners\r\nbeing informed that a Bill for the Regulation of the African Trade is\r\nnow before the House, containing a clause which restrains the officers\r\nof the African Company from exporting negroes, your petitioners, deeply\r\naffected with a consideration of the rapine, oppression, and bloodshed,\r\nattending this traffic, humbly request that this restriction may be\r\nextended to all persons whomsoever, or that the House would grant such\r\nother relief in the premises as in its wisdom may seem meet.\"\r\n\r\nThis petition was presented by Sir Cecil Wray, who, on introducing it,\r\nspoke very respectfully of the society. He declared his hearty\r\napprobation of their application, and said he hoped he should see the\r\nday when not a slave would remain within the dominions of this realm.\r\nLord North seconded the motion, saying he could have no objection to the\r\npetition, and that its object ought to recommend it to every humane\r\nbreast; that it did credit to the most benevolent society in the world;\r\nbut that, the session, being so far advanced, the subject, could not\r\nthen be taken into consideration; and he regretted that the Slave Trade,\r\nagainst which the petition was so justly directed, was in a commercial\r\nview become necessary to almost every nation of Europe. The petition was\r\nthen brought up and read, after which it was ordered to lie on the\r\ntable. This was the first petition (being two years earlier than that\r\nfrom the inhabitants of Bridgewater), which was ever presented to\r\nparliament for the abolition of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nBut the society did not stop here; for having at the yearly meeting of\r\n1783 particularly recommended the cause to a standing committee,\r\nappointed to act at intervals, called the Meeting for Sufferings, the\r\nlatter in this same year resolved upon an address to the public,\r\nentitled, _The Case of our Fellow-creatures, the oppressed Africans,\r\nrespectfully recommended to the serious Consideration of the Legislature\r\nof Great Britain, by the People called Quakers_: in which they\r\nendeavoured, in the most pathetic manner, to make the reader acquainted\r\nwith the cruel nature of this trade; and they ordered 2000 copies of it\r\nto be printed.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1784, they began the distribution of this case. The first\r\ncopy was sent to the king through Lord Carmarthen, and the second and\r\nthe third, through proper officers, to the queen and the Prince of\r\nWales. Others were sent by a deputation of two members of the society to\r\nMr. Pitt, as prime-minister; to the Lord Chancellor Thurlow; to Lord\r\nGower, as president of the council; to Lords Carmarthen and Sidney, as\r\nsecretaries of state; to Lord Chief-Justice Mansfield; to Lord Howe, as\r\nfirst lord of the Admiralty; and to C.F. Cornwall, Esq., as speaker of\r\nthe House of Commons. Copies were sent also to every member of both\r\nhouses of parliament.\r\n\r\nThe society, in the same year, anxious that the conduct of its members\r\nshould be consistent with its public profession on this great subject,\r\nrecommended it to the quarterly and monthly meetings to inquire through\r\ntheir respective districts, whether any, bearing its name, were in any\r\nway concerned in the traffic, and to deal with such, and to report the\r\nsuccess of their labours in the ensuing year. Orders were also given for\r\nthe reprinting and circulation of 10,000 other copies of _The Case_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1785, the society interested itself again in a similar\r\nmanner. For the Meeting for Sufferings, as representing it, recommended\r\nto the quarterly meetings to distribute a work, written by Anthony\r\nBenezet, in America, called _A Caution to Great Britain and her\r\nColonies, in a short Representation of the calamitous State of the\r\nenslaved Negroes in the British Dominions._ This book was accordingly\r\nforwarded to them for this purpose. On receiving it, they sent it among\r\nseveral public bodies, the regular and dissenting clergy, justices of\r\nthe peace, and particularly among the great Schools of the kingdom, that\r\nthe rising youth might acquire a knowledge, and at the same time a\r\ndetestation, of this cruel traffic. In this latter base, a deputation of\r\nthe society waited, upon the masters, to know if they would allow their\r\nscholars to receive it. The schools of Westminster, the Charter-house,\r\nSt. Paul, Merchant-Taylors, Eton, Winchester, and Harrow, were among\r\nthose visited. Several academies also were visited for this purpose.\r\n\r\nBut I must now take my leave of the Quakers as a public body[A] and go\r\nback to the year 1783, to record an event, which will be found of great\r\nimportance in the present history, and in which only individuals\r\nbelonging to the society were concerned. This event seems to have arisen\r\nnaturally out of existing or past circumstances. For the society, as I\r\nhave before stated, had sent a petition to parliament in this year,\r\npraying for the abolition, of the Slave Trade. It had also laid the\r\nfoundation for a public distribution of the books as just mentioned,\r\nwith a view of enlightening others on this great subject. The case of\r\nthe ship Zong, which I have before had occasion to explain, had occurred\r\nthis same year. A letter also had been presented, much about the same\r\ntime, by Benjamin West, from Anthony Benezet, before mentioned, to our\r\nqueen, in behalf of the injured Africans, which she had received\r\ngraciously. These subjects occupied at this time the attention of many\r\nQuaker families, and among others, that of a few individuals, who were\r\nin close intimacy with each other. These, when they met together,\r\nfrequently conversed upon them. They perceived, as facts came out in\r\nconversation, that there was a growing knowledge and hatred of the Slave\r\nTrade, and that the temper of the times was ripening towards its\r\nabolition. Hence a disposition manifested itself among these, to unite\r\nas labourers for the furtherance of so desirable an object. An union was\r\nat length proposed and approved of, and the following persons (placed in\r\nalphabetical order) came together to execute the offices growing out of\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The Quakers, as a public body, kept the subject alive at\r\ntheir yearly meeting in 1784, 1785, 1787, &c.]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM DILLWYN,  THOMAS KNOWLES, M.D.\r\nGEORGE HARRISON,  JOHN LLOYD,\r\nSAMUEL HOARE,     JOSEPH WOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first meeting was held on the seventh of July, 1783. At this \"they\r\nassembled to consider what steps they should take for the relief and\r\nliberation of the negro slaves in the West Indies, and for the\r\ndiscouragement of the Slave Trade on the coast of Africa.\"\r\n\r\nTo promote this object; they conceived it necessary that the public mind\r\nshould be enlightened respecting it. They had recourse; therefore, to\r\nthe public papers, and they appointed their members in turn to write in\r\nthese, and to see that their productions were inserted. They kept\r\nregular minutes for this purpose. It was not however known to the world\r\nthat such an association existed.\r\n\r\nIt appears that they had several meetings in the course of this year.\r\nBefore the close of it they had secured a place in the _General Evening\r\nPost_, in _Lloyd's Evening Post_, in the Norwich, Bath, York, Bristol,\r\nSherborne, Liverpool, Newcastle, and other provincial papers, for such\r\narticles as they chose to send to them. These consisted principally of\r\nextracts from such authors, both in prose and verse, as they thought\r\nwould most enlighten and interest the mind upon the subject of their\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1784 they pursued the same plan; but they began now to print\r\nbooks. The first was from a manuscript composed by Joseph Woods, one of\r\nthe committee; It was entitled, _Thoughts on the Slavery of the\r\nNegroes_. This manuscript was well put together. It was a manly and yet\r\nfeeling address in behalf of the oppressed Africans. It contained a\r\nsober and dispassionate appeal to the reason of all, without offending\r\nthe prejudices of any. It was distributed at the expense of the\r\nassociation, and proved to be highly useful to the cause which it was\r\nintended to promote.\r\n\r\nA communication having been made to the committee, that Dr. Porteus,\r\nthen Bishop of Chester, had preached a sermon before the society for the\r\npropagation of the gospel, in behalf of the injured Africans, (which\r\nsermon was noticed in the last chapter,) Samuel Hoare was deputed to\r\nobtain permission to publish it. This led him to a correspondence with\r\nMr. Ramsay before mentioned. The latter applied in consequence to the\r\nbishop, and obtained his consent. Thus this valuable sermon was also\r\ngiven to the world.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1785, the association continued their exertions as before;\r\nbut I have no room to specify them. I may observe, however, that David\r\nBarclay, a grandson of the great apologist of that name, assisted at one\r\nof their meetings, and (what is singular) that he was in a few years\r\nafterwards unexpectedly called to a trial of his principles on this very\r\nsubject. For he and his brother John became, in consequence of a debt\r\ndue to them, possessed of a large grazing farm, or pen, in Jamaica,\r\nwhich had thirty-two slaves upon it. Convinced, however, that the\r\nretaining of their fellow-creatures in bondage was not only\r\nirreconcilable with the principles of Christianity, but subversive of\r\nthe rights of human nature, they determined upon the emancipation of\r\nthese. And they[A] performed this generous office to the satisfaction of\r\ntheir minds, to the honour of their characters, to the benefit of the\r\npublic, and to the happiness of the slave[B]. I mention this anecdote,\r\nnot only to gratify myself, by paying a proper respect to those generous\r\npersons who sacrificed their interest to principle, but also to show the\r\nsincerity of David Barclay, (who is now the only surviving brother,) as\r\nhe actually put in practice what at one of these meetings he was\r\ndesirous of recommending to others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: They engaged an agent to embark for Jamaica in 1796 to\r\neffect this business, and had the slaves conveyed to Philadelphia, where\r\nthey were kindly received by the Society for improving the Condition of\r\nfree Black people. Suitable situations were found for the adults, and\r\nthe young ones were bound out apprentices to handicraft trades, and to\r\nreceive school learning.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: James Pemberton, of Philadelphia, made the following\r\nobservation in a letter to a Friend in England:--\"David Barclay's humane\r\nviews towards the Blacks from Jamaica have been so far realized, that\r\nthese objects of his concern enjoy their freedom with comfort to\r\nthemselves, and are respectable in their characters, keeping up a\r\nfriendly intercourse with each other, and avoiding to intermix with the\r\ncommon Blacks of this city, being sober in their conduct and industrious\r\nin their business.\"]\r\n\r\nHaving now brought up the proceedings of this little association towards\r\nthe year 1786, I shall take my leave of it, remarking, that it was the\r\nfirst ever formed in England for the promotion of the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade. That Quakers have had this honour is unquestionable. Nor is\r\nit extraordinary that they should have taken the lead on this occasion,\r\nwhen we consider how advantageously they have been situated for so\r\ndoing. For the Slave Trade, as we have not long ago seen, came within\r\nthe discipline of the society in the year 1727. From thence it continued\r\nto be an object of it till 1783. In 1783 the society petitioned\r\nparliament, and in 1784 it distributed books to enlighten the public\r\nconcerning it. Thus we see that every Quaker, born since the year 1727,\r\nwas nourished as it were in a fixed hatred against it. He was taught,\r\nthat any concern in it was a crime of the deepest dye. He was taught,\r\nthat the bearing of his testimony against it was a test of unity with\r\nthose of the same religious profession. The discipline of the Quakers\r\nwas therefore a school for bringing them up as advocates for the\r\nabolition of this trade. To this it may be added, that the Quakers knew\r\nmore about the trade and the slavery of the Africans, than any other\r\nreligious body of men, who had not been in the land of their sufferings.\r\nFor there had been a correspondence between the society in America and\r\nthat in England on the subject, the contents of which must have been\r\nknown to the members of each. American ministers also were frequently\r\ncrossing the Atlantic on religious missions to England. These, when they\r\ntravelled through various parts of our island, frequently related to the\r\nQuaker families in their way the cruelties they had seen and heard of in\r\ntheir own country. English ministers were also frequently going over to\r\nAmerica on the same religious errand. These, on their return, seldom\r\nfailed to communicate what they had learned or observed, but more\r\nparticularly relative to the oppressed Africans, in their travels. The\r\njournals also of these, which gave occasional accounts of the sufferings\r\nof the slaves, were frequently published. Thus situated in point of\r\nknowledge, and brought up moreover from their youth in a detestation of\r\nthe trade, the Quakers were ready to act whenever a favourable\r\nopportunity should present itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nThird class of forerunners and coadjutors, up to 1787,\r\nconsists of the Quakers and others in America.--Yearly meeting for\r\nPennsylvania and the Jerseys takes up the subject in 1696; and continue\r\nit till 1787.--Other five yearly meetings take similar\r\nmeasures.--Quakers, as individuals, also become labourers; William\r\nBurling and others.--Individuals of other religious denominations take\r\nup the cause also; Judge Sewell and others.--Union of the Quakers with\r\nothers in a society for Pennsylvania, in 1774; James Pemberton; Dr.\r\nRush.--Similar union of the Quakers with others for New York and other\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next class of the forerunners and coadjutors, up to the year 1787,\r\nwill consist, first, of the Quakers in America; and then of others, as\r\nthey were united to these for the same object.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, How the Quakers living there should have become\r\nforerunners and coadjutors in the great work now under our\r\nconsideration. I reply, first, that it was an object for many years with\r\nthese to do away the Slave Trade as it was carried on in their own\r\nports. But this trade was conducted in part, both before and after the\r\nindependence of America, by our own countrymen. It was, secondly, an\r\nobject with these to annihilate slavery in America; and this they have\r\nbeen instruments in accomplishing to a considerable extent. But any\r\nabolition of slavery within given boundaries must be a blow to the Slave\r\nTrade there. The American Quakers, lastly, living in a land where both\r\nthe commerce and slavery existed, were in the way of obtaining a number\r\nof important facts relative to both, which made for their annihilation;\r\nand communicating many of these facts to those in England, who espoused\r\nthe same cause, they became fellow-labourers with these in producing the\r\nevent in question.\r\n\r\nThe Quakers in America, it must be owned, did most of them originally as\r\nother settlers there with respect to the purchase of slaves. They had\r\nlands without a sufficient number of labourers, and families without a\r\nsufficient number of servants, for their work. Africans were poured in\r\nto obviate these difficulties, and these were bought promiscuously by\r\nall. In these days, indeed, the purchase of them was deemed favourable\r\nto both parties, for there was little or no knowledge of the manner in\r\nwhich they had been procured as slaves. There was no charge of\r\ninconsistency on this account, as in later times. But though many of the\r\nQuakers engaged, without their usual consideration, in purchases of this\r\nkind, yet those constitutional principles, which belong to the society,\r\noccasioned the members of it in general to treat those whom they\r\npurchased with great tenderness, considering them, though of a different\r\ncolour, as brethren, and as persons for whose spiritual welfare it\r\nbecame them to be concerned; so that slavery, except as to the power\r\nlegally belonging to it, was in general little more than servitude in\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nThis treatment, as it was thus mild on the continent of America where\r\nthe members of this society were the owners of slaves, so it was equally\r\nmild in The West India Islands where they had a similar property. In the\r\nlatter countries, however, where only a few of them lived, it began soon\r\nto be productive of serious consequences; for it was so different from\r\nthat which the rest of the inhabitants considered to be proper, that the\r\nlatter became alarmed at it. Hence in Barbados an act was passed in\r\n1676, under Governor Atkins, which was entitled, An Act to prevent the\r\npeople called Quakers from bringing their Negroes into their meetings\r\nfor worship, though they held these in their own houses. This act was\r\nfounded on the pretence, that the safety of the island might be\r\nendangered, if the slaves were to imbibe the religious principles of\r\ntheir masters. Under this act Ralph Fretwell and Richard Sutton were\r\nfined in the different sums of eight hundred and of three hundred\r\npounds, because each of them had suffered a meeting of the Quakers at\r\nhis own house, at the first of which eighty negroes, and at the second\r\nof which thirty of them were present. But this matter was carried still\r\nfurther; for in 1680, Sir Richard Dutton, then governor of the island,\r\nissued an order to the Deputy Provost Marshal and others, to prohibit\r\nall meetings of this society. In the island of Nevis the same bad spirit\r\nmanifested itself. So early as in 1661, a law was made there prohibiting\r\nmembers of this society from coming on shore. Negroes were put in irons\r\nfor being present at their meetings, and they themselves were fined\r\nalso. At length, in 1677, another act was passed, laying a heavy penalty\r\non every master of a vessel who should even bring a Quaker to the\r\nisland. In Antigua and Bermudas similar proceedings took place, so that\r\nthe Quakers were in time expelled from this part of the world. By these\r\nmeans a valuable body of men were lost to the community in these\r\nislands, whose example might have been highly useful; and the poor\r\nslave, who saw nothing but misery in his temporal prospects, was\r\ndeprived of the only balm which could have soothed his sorrow--the\r\ncomfort of religion.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the continent of America. Though the treatment which\r\nthe Quakers adopted there towards those Africans who fell into their\r\nhands, was so highly commendable, it did not prevent individuals among\r\nthem from becoming uneasy about holding them in slavery at all. Some of\r\nthese bore their private testimony against it from the beginning as a\r\nwrong practice, and in process of time brought it before the notice of\r\ntheir brethren as a religious body. So early as in the year 1688, some\r\nemigrants from Krieshiem in Germany, who had adopted the principles of\r\nWilliam Penn, and followed him into Pennsylvania, urged, in the yearly\r\nmeeting of the society there, the inconsistency of buying, selling, and\r\nholding men in slavery, with the principles of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1696, the yearly meeting for that province took up the\r\nsubject as a public concern, and the result was, advice to the members\r\nof it to guard against future-importations of African slaves, and to be\r\nparticularly attentive to the treatment of those who were then in their\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1711, the same yearly meeting resumed the important subject,\r\nand confirmed and renewed the advice which had been before given.\r\n\r\nFrom this time it continued to keep the subject alive; but finding at\r\nlength, that though individuals refused to purchase slaves, yet others\r\ncontinued the custom, and in greater numbers than it was apprehended\r\nwould have been the case after the public declarations which had been\r\nmade, it determined, in the year 1754, upon a fuller and more serious\r\npublication of its sentiments; and therefore it issued, in the same\r\nyear, the following pertinent letter to all the members within its\r\njurisdiction:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dear Friends,\r\n\r\n    It hath frequently been the concern of our yearly meeting to\r\n    testify their uneasiness and disunity with the importation and\r\n    purchasing of negroes and other slaves, and to direct the\r\n    overseers of the several meetings to advise and deal with such\r\n    as engage therein. And it hath likewise been the continual care\r\n    of many weighty friends to press those who bear our name, to\r\n    guard, as much as possible, against being in any respect\r\n    concerned in promoting the bondage of such unhappy people. Yet,\r\n    as we have with sorrow to observe, that their number is of late\r\n    increased among us, we have thought it proper to make our advice\r\n    and judgment more public, that none may plead ignorance of our\r\n    principles therein; and also again earnestly to exhort all to\r\n    avoid, in any manner, encouraging that practice of making slaves\r\n    of our fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\n    Now, dear friends, if we continually bear in mind the royal law\r\n    of doing to others as we would be done by, we should never think\r\n    of bereaving our fellow-creatures of that valuable\r\n    blessing--liberty, nor endure to grow rich by their bondage. To\r\n    live in ease and plenty by the toil of those whom violence and\r\n    cruelty have put in our power, is neither consistent with\r\n    Christianity nor common justice; and, we have good reason to\r\n    believe, draws down the displeasure of Heaven; it being a\r\n    melancholy but true reflection, that, where slave-keeping\r\n    prevails, pure religion and sobriety decline, as it evidently\r\n    tends to harden the heart, and render the soul less susceptible\r\n    of that holy spirit of love, meekness and charity, which is the\r\n    peculiar characteristic of a true Christian.\r\n\r\n    How then can we, who have been concerned to publish the Gospel\r\n    of universal love and peace among mankind, be so inconsistent\r\n    with ourselves, as to purchase such as are prisoners of war, and\r\n    thereby encourage, this anti-Christian practice; and more\r\n    especially as many of these poor creatures are stolen away,\r\n    parents from children, and children from parents; and others,\r\n    who were in good circumstances in their native country,\r\n    inhumanly torn from what they esteemed a happy situation, and\r\n    compelled to toil in a state of slavery, too often extremely\r\n    cruel!\r\n\r\n    What dreadful scenes of murder and cruelty those barbarous\r\n    ravages must occasion in these unhappy people's country are too\r\n    obvious to mention. Let us make their case our own, and consider\r\n    what we should think, and how we should feel, were we in their\r\n    circumstances. Remember our blessed Redeemer's positive\r\n    command--to do unto others as we would have them do unto\r\n    us;--and that with what measure we mete, it shall be measured to\r\n    us again. And we intreat you to examine, whether the purchasing\r\n    of a negro, either born here or imported, doth not contribute to\r\n    a further importation, and, consequently, to the upholding of\r\n    all the evils above mentioned, and to the promoting of\r\n    man-stealing, the, only theft which by the Mosaic law was\r\n    punished with death;--He that stealeth a man and selleth him or\r\n    if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.'\r\n\r\n    The characteristic and badge of a true Christian is love and\r\n    continual exercise of them: 'Love one, another,' says he, 'as I\r\n    have loved you.' But how can we be said to love our brethren who\r\n    bring, or, for selfish ends, keep them in bondage? Do we act\r\n    consistently with this noble principle, who lay such heavy\r\n    burdens on our fellow creatures? Do we consider that they are\r\n    called and do we sincerely desire that they may become heirs\r\n    with us in glory, and that they may rejoice in the liberty of\r\n    the sons of God, whilst we are withholding from them the common\r\n    liberties of mankind? Or can the spirit of God, by which we have\r\n    always professed to be led, be the author of these oppressive\r\n    and unrighteous measures? Or do we not thereby manifest, that\r\n    temporal interest hath more influence on our conduct herein,\r\n    than the dictates of that merciful, holy, and unerring Guide?\r\n\r\n    And we, likewise, earnestly recommend to all who have slaves, to\r\n    be careful to come up in the performance of their duty towards\r\n    them, and to be particularly watchful over their own hearts, it\r\n    being, by sorrowful experience, remarkable that custom and a\r\n    familiarity with evil of any kind, have a tendency to bias the\r\n    judgment and to deprave the mind; and it is obvious, that the\r\n    future welfare of these poor slaves, who are now in bondage, is\r\n    generally too much disregarded by those who keep them. If their\r\n    daily task of labour be but fulfilled, little else, perhaps, is\r\n    thought of: nay, even that which in others would be looked upon\r\n    with horror and detestation, is little regarded in them by their\r\n    masters; such as the frequent separation of husbands from wives,\r\n    and wives from husbands, whereby they are tempted to break their\r\n    marriage covenants, and live in adultery, in direct opposition\r\n    to the laws of God and men, although we believe that Christ died\r\n    for all men without respect of persons. How fearful then ought\r\n    we to be of engaging in what hath so natural a tendency to\r\n    lesson our humanity, and of suffering ourselves to be inured to\r\n    the exercise of hard and cruel measures, lest thereby, in any\r\n    degree, we lose our tender and feeling sense of the miseries of\r\n    our fellow-creatures, and become worse than those who have not\r\n    believed.\r\n\r\n    And, dear friends, you, who by inheritance have slaves born in\r\n    your families, we beseech you to consider them as souls\r\n    committed to your trust, whom the Lord will require at your\r\n    hand, and who, as well as you, are made partakers of the Spirit\r\n    of grace, and called to be heirs of salvation. And let it be\r\n    your constant care to watch over them for good, instructing them\r\n    in the fear of God and the knowledge of the Gospel of Christ,\r\n    that they may answer the end of their creation, and that God may\r\n    be glorified and honoured by them, as well as by us. And so\r\n    train them up, that if you should come to behold their unhappy\r\n    situation, in the same light that many worthy men who are at\r\n    rest have done, and many of your brethren now do, and should\r\n    think it your duty to set them free, they may be the more\r\n    capable of making proper use of their liberty.\r\n\r\n    Finally, brethren, we intreat you, in the bowels of Gospel-love,\r\n    seriously to weigh the Cause of detaining them in bondage. If it\r\n    be for your own private gain, or any other motive than their\r\n    good, it is much to be feared that the love of God, and the\r\n    influence of the Holy Spirit, are not the prevailing principles\r\n    in you, and that your hearts are not sufficiently redeemed from\r\n    the world, which, that you with ourselves may more and more come\r\n    to witness, through the cleansing virtue of the Holy Spirit of\r\n    Jesus Christ, is our earnest desire. With the salutation of our\r\n    love we are your friends and brethren:--\r\n\r\n    _\"Signed, in behalf of the yearly meeting, by_\r\n\r\n    JOHN EVANS,        ABRAHAM FARRINGDON,\r\n    JOHN SMITH,        JOSEPH NOBLE,\r\n    THOMAS CARLETON,   JAMES DANIEL,\r\n    WILLIAM TRIMBLE,   JOSEPH GIBSON,\r\n    JOHN SCARBOROUGH,  JOHN SHOTWELL,\r\n    JOSEPH HAMPTON,    JOSEPH PARKER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis truly Christian letter, which was written in the year 1754, was\r\ndesigned, as we collect from the contents of it, to make the sentiments\r\nof the society better known and attended to on the subject of the Slave\r\nTrade. It contains, as we see, exhortations to all the members within\r\nthe yearly meeting of Pennsylvania and the Jerseys, to desist from\r\npurchasing and importing slaves, and, where they possessed them, to have\r\na tender consideration of their condition. But that the first part of\r\nthe subject of this exhortation might be enforced, the yearly meeting\r\nfor the same provinces came to a resolution in 1755, That if any of the\r\nmembers belonging to it bought or imported slaves, the overseers were to\r\ninform their respective monthly meetings of it, that \"these might treat\r\nwith them, as they might be directed in the wisdom of truth.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1774, we find the same yearly meeting legislating again on\r\nthe same subject. By the preceding resolution they who became offenders,\r\nwere subjected only to exclusion from the meetings for discipline, and\r\nfrom the privilege of contributing to the pecuniary occasions of the\r\nSociety; but, by the resolution of the present year, all members\r\nconcerned in importing, selling, purchasing, giving, or transferring\r\nnegro or other slaves, or otherwise acting in such manner as to continue\r\nthem in slavery beyond the term limited by law[A] or custom, were\r\ndirected to be excluded from membership or disowned. At this meeting\r\nalso all the members of it were cautioned and advised against acting as\r\nexecutors or administrators to estates, where slaves were bequeathed, or\r\nlikely to be detained in bondage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: This alludes to the term of servitude for white persons in\r\nthese provinces.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1776, the same yearly meeting carried the matter still\r\nfurther. It was enacted, That the owners of slaves, who refused to\r\nexecute proper instruments for giving them their freedom, were to be\r\ndisowned likewise.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 it was enacted by the same meeting, that the children of those\r\nwho had been set free by members, should be tenderly advised, and have a\r\nsuitable education given them.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to proceed further on this subject. It may be\r\nsufficient to say, that from this time the minutes of the yearly meeting\r\nfor Pennsylvania and the Jerseys exhibit proofs of an almost incessant\r\nattention, year after year[B], to the means not only of wiping away the\r\nstain of slavery from their religious community, but of promoting the\r\nhappiness of those restored to freedom, and of their posterity also; and\r\nas the yearly meeting of Pennsylvania and the Jerseys set this bright\r\nexample, so those of New England, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and of\r\nthe Carolinas and Georgia, in process of time followed it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Thus in 1778-1782, 1784-1786. The members also of this\r\nmeeting petitioned their own legislature on this subject, both in 1783\r\nand in 1786.]\r\n\r\nBut, whilst the Quakers were making these exertions at their different\r\nyearly meetings in America, as a religious body, to get rid both of the\r\ncommerce and slavery of their fellow-creatures, others, in the same\r\nprofession; were acting as individuals, (that is, on their own grounds,\r\nand independently of any influence from their religious communion,) in\r\nthe same cause, whose labours it will now be proper, in a separate\r\nnarrative, to detail.\r\n\r\nThe first person of this description in the Society, was William\r\nBurling, of Long Island. He had conceived an abhorrence of slavery from\r\nearly youth. In process of time he began to bear his testimony against\r\nit, by representing the unlawfulness of it to those of his own Society,\r\nwhen assembled at one of their yearly meetings. This expression of his\r\npublic testimony, he continued annually on the same occasion. He wrote\r\nalso several Tracts with the same design, one of which, published in the\r\nyear 1718, he addressed to the elders of his own church, on the\r\ninconsistency of compelling people and their posterity to serve them\r\ncontinually and arbitrarily, and without any proper recompense for their\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThe next was Ralph Sandiford, a merchant in Philadelphia. This worthy\r\nperson had many offers of pecuniary assistance, which would have\r\nadvanced him in life, but he declined them all because they came from\r\npersons who had acquired their independence by the oppression of their\r\nslaves. He was very earnest in endeavouring to prevail upon his friends,\r\nboth, in and out of the society, to liberate those whom they held in\r\nbondage. At length he determined upon a work called the _Mystery of\r\nIniquity_, in a brief examination of the practice of the times. This he\r\npublished in the year 1780, though the chief judge had threatened him if\r\nhe should give it to the world, and he circulated it free of expense\r\nwherever he believed it would be useful. The above work was excellent as\r\na composition; the language of it was correct; the style manly and\r\nenergetic; and it abounded with facts, sentiments, and quotations,\r\nwhich, while, they showed the virtue and talents of the author, rendered\r\nit a valuable appeal in behalf of the African cause.\r\n\r\nThe next public advocate was Benjamin Lay[A], who lived at Abington, at\r\nthe distance of twelve or fourteen miles from Philadelphia. Benjamin Lay\r\nwas known, when in England, to the royal family of that day, into whose\r\nprivate presence he was admitted. On his return to America, he took an\r\nactive part in behalf of the oppressed Africans. In the year 1737, he\r\npublished a _Treatise on Slave-Keeping_. This he gave away among his\r\nneighbours and others, but more particularly among the rising youth,\r\nmany of whom he visited in their respective schools. He applied also to\r\nseveral of the governors for interviews, with whom he held conferences\r\non the subject. Benjamin Lay was a man of strong understanding and of\r\ngreat integrity, but of warm and irritable feelings, and more\r\nparticularly so when he was called forth on any occasion in which the\r\noppressed Africans were concerned; for he had lived in the island of\r\nBarbados, and he had witnessed there scenes of cruelty towards them\r\nwhich had greatly disturbed his mind, and which unhinged it, as it were,\r\nwhenever the subject of their sufferings was brought before him. Hence,\r\nif others did not think precisely as he did, when he conversed with them\r\non the subject, he was apt to go out of due bounds. In bearing what he\r\nbelieved to be his testimony against this system of oppression, he\r\nadopted sometimes a singularity of manner, by which, as conveying\r\ndemonstration of a certain eccentricity of character, he diminished in\r\nsome degree his usefulness to the cause which he had undertaken; as far,\r\nindeed, as this eccentricity might have the effect of preventing others\r\nfrom joining him in his pursuit, lest they should be thought singular\r\nalso, so far it must be allowed that he ceased to become beneficial. But\r\nthere can be no question, on the other hand, that his warm and\r\nenthusiastic manners awakened the attention of many to the cause, and\r\ngave them first impressions concerning it, which they never afterwards\r\nforgot, and which rendered them useful to it in the subsequent part of\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Benjamin Lay attended the meetings for worship, or\r\nassociated himself with the religious society of the Quakers. His wife,\r\ntoo, was an approved minister of the Gospel in that society; but I\r\nbelieve he was not long an acknowledged member of it himself.]\r\n\r\nThe person who laboured next in the society, in behalf of the oppressed\r\nAfricans, was John Woolman.\r\n\r\nJohn Woolman was born at Northampton, in the county of Burlington and\r\nprovince of Western New Jersey, in the year 1720. In his very early\r\nyouth he attended, in an extraordinary manner, to the religious\r\nimpressions which he perceived upon his mind, and began to have an\r\nearnest solicitude about treading in the right path. \"From what I had\r\nread and heard,\" says he, in his Journal[A], \"I believed there had been\r\nin past ages, people who walked in uprightness before God in a degree\r\nexceeding any, that I knew or heard of, now living. And the apprehension\r\nof there being less steadiness and firmness among people of this age,\r\nthan in past ages, often troubled me while I was a child.\" An anxious\r\ndesire to do away, as far as himself was concerned, this merited\r\nreproach, operated as one among other causes to induce him to be\r\nparticularly watchful over his thoughts and actions, and to endeavour to\r\nattain that purity of heart, without which he conceived there could be\r\nno perfection of the Christian character. Accordingly, in the\r\ntwenty-second year of his age, he had given such proof of the integrity\r\nof his life, and of his religious qualifications, that he became an\r\nacknowledged minister of the Gospel in his own society.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: This short sketch of the life and labours of John Woolman,\r\nis made up from his Journal.]\r\n\r\nAt a time prior to his entering upon the ministry, being in low\r\ncircumstances, he agreed for wages to \"attend shop for a person at Mount\r\nHolly, and to keep his books.\" In this situation we discover, by an\r\noccurrence that happened, that he had thought seriously on the subject,\r\nand that he had conceived proper views of the Christian unlawfulness of\r\nslavery. \"My employer,\" says he, \"having a Negro woman, sold her, and\r\ndesired me to write a bill of sale, the man being waiting who bought\r\nher. The thing was sudden, and though the thought of writing an\r\ninstrument of slavery for one of my fellow-creatures made me feel\r\nuneasy, yet I remembered I was hired by the year, that it was my master\r\nwho directed me to do it, and that it was an elderly man, a member of\r\nour society, who bought her. So through weakness I gave way and wrote,\r\nbut, at executing it, I was so afflicted in my mind, that I said before\r\nmy master and the friend, that I believed slave-keeping to be a practice\r\ninconsistent with the Christian religion. This in some degree abated my\r\nuneasiness; yet, as often as I reflected seriously upon it, I thought I\r\nshould have been clearer, if I had desired to have been excused from it,\r\nas a thing against my conscience; for such it was. And some time after\r\nthis, a young man of our society spoke to me to write a conveyance of a\r\nslave to him, he having lately taken a Negro into his house. I told him\r\nI was not easy to write it; for though many of our meeting, and in other\r\nplaces, kept slaves, I still believed the practice was not right, and\r\ndesired to be excused from the writing. I spoke to him in good-will; and\r\nhe told me that keeping slaves was not altogether agreeable to his mind,\r\nbut that the slave being a gift to his wife he had accepted of her.\"\r\n\r\nWe may easily conceive that a person so scrupulous and tender on this\r\nsubject, (as indeed John Woolman was on all others,) was in the way of\r\nbecoming in time more eminently serviceable to his oppressed\r\nfellow-creatures. We have seen already the good seed sown in his heart,\r\nand it seems to have wanted only providential seasons and occurrences to\r\nbe brought into productive fruit. Accordingly we find that a journey,\r\nwhich he took as a minister of the Gospel in 1746 through the provinces\r\nof Maryland, Virginia, and, North Carolina, which were then more noted\r\nthan others for the number of slaves in them, contributed to prepare him\r\nas an instrument for the advancement of this great cause. The following\r\nare his own observations upon this journey:--\"Two things were remarkable\r\nto me in this journey; first, in regard to my entertainment. When I ate,\r\ndrank, and lodged free-cost, with people who lived in ease on the hard\r\nlabour of their slaves, I felt uneasy; and, as my mind was inward to the\r\nLord, I found, from place to place, this uneasiness return upon me at\r\ntimes through the whole visit. Where the masters bore a good share of\r\nthe burden and lived frugally, so that their servants were well provided\r\nfor; and their labour moderate, I felt more easy; but where they lived\r\nin a costly way, and laid heavy burdens on their slaves, my exercise was\r\noften great, and I frequently had conversations with them in private\r\nconcerning it. Secondly, this trade of importing slaves from their\r\nnative country being much encouraged among them, and the white people\r\nand their children so generally living without much labour, was\r\nfrequently the subject of my serious thoughts: and I saw in these\r\nsouthern provinces so many vices and corruptions, increased by this\r\ntrade and this way of life, that it appeared to me as a gloom over the\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1747 to the year 1758, he seems to have been occupied\r\nchiefly as a minister of religion, but in the latter year he published a\r\nwork upon slave-keeping; and in the same year, while travelling within\r\nthe compass of his own monthly meeting, a circumstance happened which\r\nkept alive his attention to the same Subjects.\r\n\r\n\"About this time\" says he, \"a person at some distance lying sick, his\r\nbrother came to me to write his will. I knew he had slaves, and asking\r\nhis brother was told he intended to leave them as slaves to his\r\nchildren. As writing was a profitable employ, and as offending sober\r\npeople was disagreeable to my inclination, I was straitened in my mind,\r\nbut as I looked to the Lord he inclined my heart to his testimony; and I\r\ntold the man that I believed the practice of continuing slavery to this\r\npeople was not right, and that I had a scruple in my mind against doing\r\nwritings of that kind; that, though many in our society kept them as\r\nslaves, still I was not easy to be concerned in it, and desired to be\r\nexcused from going to write the will. I spoke to him in the fear of the\r\nLord; and he made no reply to what I said, but went away: he also had\r\nsome concerns in the practice, and I thought he was displeased with me.\r\nIn this case I had a confirmation, that acting contrary to present\r\noutward interest from a motive of Divine love, and in regard to truth\r\nand righteousness, opens the way to a treasure better than silver, and\r\nto a friendship exceeding the friendship of men.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1753 to 1755, two circumstances of a similar kind took place, which\r\ncontributed greatly to strengthen him in the path he had taken; for in\r\nboth these cases the persons who requested him to make their wills were\r\nso impressed by the principle upon which he refused them, and by his\r\nmanner of doing it, that they bequeathed liberty to their slaves.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1756, he made a religious visit to several of the society in\r\nLong Island. Here it was that the seed, now long fostered by the genial\r\ninfluences of Heaven, began to burst forth into fruit; Till this time he\r\nseems to have been a passive instrument, attending only to such\r\ncircumstances as came in his way on this subject. But now he became an\r\nactive one, looking out for circumstances for the exercise of his\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\n\"My mind,\" says he; \"was deeply engaged in this visit, both in public\r\nand private; and at several places, observing that members kept slaves,\r\nI found myself under a necessity, in a friendly way, to labour with\r\nthem, on that subject, expressing, as the way opened, the inconsistency\r\nof that practice with the parity of the Christian religion, and the ill\r\neffects of it as manifested amongst us.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1757, he felt, his mind so deeply interested on the same\r\nsubject, that he resolved to travel over Maryland, Virginia, and North\r\nCarolina, in order to try to convince persons, principally in his own\r\nsociety, of the inconsistency of holding slaves. He joined his brother\r\nwith him in this arduous service. Having passed the Susquehanna into\r\nMaryland, he began to experience great agitation of mind. \"Soon after I\r\nentered this province,\" says he, \"a deep and painful exercise came upon\r\nme, which I often had some feeling of since my mind was drawn towards\r\nthese parts, and with which I had acquainted my brother, before we\r\nagreed to join as companions.\"\r\n\r\n\"As the people in this and the southern provinces live much on the\r\nlabour of slaves, many of whom are used hardly, my concern was that I\r\nmight attend with singleness of heart to the voice of the true Shepherd,\r\nand be so supported, as to remain unmoved at the faces of men.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to follow him in detail, through this long and\r\ninteresting journey, when I consider the bounds I have prescribed to\r\nmyself in this work. I shall say, therefore, what I propose to offer\r\ngenerally, and in a few words.\r\n\r\nIt appears that he conversed with persons occasionally, who were not of\r\nhis own society, with a view of answering their arguments, and of\r\nendeavouring to evince the wickedness and impolicy of slavery. In\r\ndiscoursing with these, however strenuous he might appear, he seems\r\nnever to have departed from a calm, modest, and yet dignified and even\r\nfriendly demeanour. At the public meetings for discipline, held by his\r\nown society in these provinces, he endeavoured to display the same\r\ntruths, and in the same manner, but particularly to the elders of his\r\nown society, exhorting them, as the most conspicuous rank, to be careful\r\nof their conduct, and to give a bright example in the liberation of\r\ntheir slaves. He visited, also, families for the same purpose: and he\r\nhad the well-earned satisfaction of finding his admonitions kindly\r\nreceived by some, and of seeing a disposition in others to follow the\r\nadvice he had given them.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1758, he attended the yearly meeting at Philadelphia, where\r\nhe addressed his brethren on the propriety of dealing with such members\r\nas should hereafter purchase slaves. On the discussion of this point he\r\nspoke a second time, and this to such effect that, he had the\r\nsatisfaction at this meeting to see minutes made more fully than any\r\nbefore, and a committee appointed for the advancement of the great\r\nobject, to which he had now been instrumental in turning the attention\r\nof many, and to witness a considerable spreading of the cause. In the\r\nsame year, also, he joined himself with two others of the society to\r\nvisit such members of it as possessed slaves in Chester county. In this\r\njourney he describes himself to have met with several who were pleased\r\nwith his visit, but to have found difficulties with others, towards\r\nwhom, however, he felt a sympathy and tenderness, on account of their\r\nbeing entangled by the spirit of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1759, he visited several of the society who held slaves in\r\nPhiladelphia. In about three months afterwards, he travelled there\r\nagain, in company with John Churchman, to see others under similar\r\ncircumstances. He then went to different places on the same errand. In\r\nthis last journey he went alone. After this he joined himself to John\r\nChurchman again, but he confined his labours to his own province. Here\r\nhe had the pleasure of finding that the work prospered. Soon after this\r\nhe took Samuel Eastburne as a coadjutor, and pleaded the cause of the\r\npoor Africans with many of the society in Bucks county, who held them in\r\nbondage there.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1760, he travelled, in company with his friend Samuel\r\nEastburne, to Rhode Island, to promote the same object. This island had\r\nbeen long noted for its trade to Africa for slaves. He found at Newport,\r\nthe great sea-port town belonging to it, that a number of them had been\r\nlately imported. He felt his mind deeply impressed on this account. He\r\nwas almost over-powered in consequence of it, and became ill. He thought\r\nonce of prompting a petition to the legislature, to discourage all such\r\nimportations in future. He then thought of going and speaking to the\r\nHouse of Assembly, which was then sitting; but he was discouraged from\r\nboth these proceedings. He held, however, conference with many of his\r\nown society in the meeting-house chamber, where the subject of his visit\r\nwas discussed on both sides with a calm and peaceable spirit. Many of\r\nthose present manifested the concern they felt at their former\r\npractices, and others a desire of taking suitable care of their slaves\r\nat their decease. From Newport he proceeded to Nantucket; but observing\r\nthe members of the society there to have few or no slaves, he exhorted\r\nthem to persevere in abstaining from the use of them, and returned home.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1761, he visited several families in Pennsylvania, and, in\r\nabout three months afterwards, others about Shrewsbury and Squan in New\r\nJersey. On his return he added a part to the treatise before published\r\non the keeping of care which had been growing upon him for some years.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1762, he printed, published, and distributed this treatise.\r\n\r\nIn 1767, he went on foot to the western shores of the same province on a\r\nreligious visit. After having crossed the Susquehanna, his old feelings\r\nreturned to him; for coming amongst people living in outward ease and\r\ngreatness, chiefly on the labour of slaves, his heart was much affected,\r\nand he waited with humble resignation to learn how he should further\r\nperform his duty to this injured people. The travelling on foot, though\r\nit was agreeable to the state of his mind, he describes to have been\r\nwearisome to his body. He felt himself weakly at times, in consequence\r\nof it, but yet continued to travel on. At one of the quarterly meetings\r\nof the society, being in great sorrow and heaviness, and under deep\r\nexercise on account of the miseries of the poor Africans, he expressed\r\nhimself freely to those present, who held them in bondage. He expatiated\r\non the tenderness and loving-kindness of the apostles, as manifested in\r\nlabours, perils, and sufferings, towards the poor Gentiles, and\r\ncontracted their treatment of the Gentiles with it, whom he described in\r\nthe persons of their slaves; and was much satisfied with the result of\r\nhis discourse.\r\n\r\nFrom this time we collect little more, from his journal concerning him,\r\nthan that, in 1772, he embarked for England on a religious visit. After\r\nhis arrival there, he travelled through many counties, preaching in\r\ndifferent meetings of the society, till he came to the city of York. But\r\neven here, though he was far removed from the sight of those whose\r\ninterests he had so warmly espoused, he was not forgetful of their\r\nwretched condition. At the quarterly meeting for that county, he brought\r\ntheir case before, those present in an affecting manner. He exhorted\r\nthese to befriend their cause. He remarked that as they, the society,\r\nwhen under outward sufferings, had often found a concern to lay them\r\nbefore the legislature, and thereby, in the Lord's time, had obtained\r\nrelief; so he recommended this oppressed part of the creation to their\r\nnotice, that they might, as, the way opened, represent their sufferings\r\nas individuals, if not as a religious society, to those in authority in\r\nthis land. This was the last opportunity that he had of interesting\r\nhimself in behalf of this injured people for soon afterwards he was\r\nseized with the small-pox at the house of a friend in the city of York,\r\nwhere he died.\r\n\r\nThe next person belonging to the society of the Quakers, who laboured in\r\nbehalf of the oppressed Africans, was Anthony Benezet. He was born\r\nbefore, and he lived after, John Woolman; of course he was contemporary\r\nwith him. I place him after John Woolman, because he was not so much\r\nknown as a labourer, till two or three years after the other had begin\r\nto move in the same cause.\r\n\r\nAnthony Benezet was born at St. Quintin, in Picardy, of a respectable\r\nfamily, in the year 1713. His father was one of the many Protestants\r\nwho, in consequence of the persecutions which followed the revocation of\r\nthe edict of Nantz, sought an asylum in foreign countries. After a short\r\nstay in Holland, he settled, with his wife and children, in London, in\r\n1715.\r\n\r\nAnthony Benezet having received from his father a liberal education,\r\nserved an apprenticeship in an eminent mercantile house in London. In\r\n1731, however, he removed with his family to Philadelphia, where he\r\njoined in profession with the Quakers. His three brothers then engaged\r\nin trade, and made considerable pecuniary acquisitions in it. He himself\r\nmight have partaken both of their concerns and of their prosperity; but\r\nhe did not feel himself at liberty to embark in their undertakings. He\r\nconsidered the accumulation of wealth as of no importance, when compared\r\nwith the enjoyment of doing good; and he chose the humble situation of a\r\nschoolmaster, as according best with this notion, believing, that by\r\nendeavouring to train up youth in knowledge and virtue, he should become\r\nmore extensively useful than in any other way to his fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nHe had not been long in his new situation, before he manifested such an\r\nuprightness of conduct, such a courtesy of manners, such a purity of\r\nintention, and such a spirit of benevolence, that he attracted the\r\nnotice, and gained the good opinion, of the inhabitants among whom he\r\nlived. He had ready access to them, in consequence, upon all occasions;\r\nand, if there were any whom he failed to influence at any of these\r\ntimes, he never went away without the possession of their respect.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1756, when a considerable number of French families were\r\nremoved from Acadia into Pennsylvania, on account of some political\r\nsuspicions, he felt deeply interested about them. In a country where few\r\nunderstood their language, they were wretched and helpless; but Anthony\r\nBenezet endeavoured to soften the rigour of their situation, by his kind\r\nattention towards them. He exerted himself, also, in their behalf, by\r\nprocuring many contributions for them, which, by the consent of his\r\nfellow-citizens, were intrusted to his care.\r\n\r\nAs the principle of benevolence, when duly cultivated, brings forth\r\nfresh shoots, and becomes enlarged, so we find this amiable person\r\nextending the sphere of his usefulness by becoming an advocate for the\r\noppressed African race. For this service he seems to have been\r\npeculiarly qualified. Indeed, as in all great works, a variety of\r\ntalents is necessary to bring them to perfection, so Providence seems to\r\nprepare different men as instruments, with dispositions and\r\nqualifications so various, that each, in pursuing that line which seems\r\nto suit him best, contributes to furnish those parts which, when put\r\ntogether, make up a complete whole. In this point of view, John Woolman\r\nfound in Anthony Benezet the coadjutor whom, of all others, the cause\r\nrequired. The former had occupied himself principally on the subject of\r\nslavery. The latter went to the root of the evil, and more frequently\r\nattacked the trade. The former chiefly confined his labours to America,\r\nand chiefly to those of his own society there. The latter, when he\r\nwrote, did not write for America only, but for Europe also, and\r\nendeavoured to spread a knowledge and hatred of the traffic through the\r\ngreat society of the world.\r\n\r\nOne of the means which Anthony Benezet took to promote the cause in\r\nquestion, (and an effectual one it proved, as far as it went,) was to\r\ngive his scholars a due knowledge and proper impressions concerning it.\r\nSituated as they were likely to be in after-life, in a country where,\r\nslavery, was a custom, he thus prepared many, and this annually, for the\r\npromotion of his plans.\r\n\r\nTo enlighten others, and to give them a similar bias, he had recourse to\r\ndifferent measures from time to time. In the almanacs published annually\r\nin Philadelphia, he procured articles to be inserted, which he believed\r\nwould attract the notice of the reader, and make him pause, at least for\r\na while, as to the licitness of, the Slave Trade. He wrote also, as he\r\nsaw occasion, in the public papers of the day. From small things he\r\nproceeded to greater. He collected, at length, further information on\r\nthe subject, and, winding it up with observations and reflections, he\r\nproduced several little tracts, which he circulated successively (but\r\ngenerally at his, own expense), as he considered them adapted to the\r\ntemper and circumstances of the times.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this his employment, having found some who had approved\r\nhis tracts, and, to whom, on that account, he wished to write, and\r\nsending his tracts to others, to whom he thought it proper to introduce\r\nthem by letter, he found himself engaged in a correspondence which much\r\nengrossed his time, but which proved of great importance in procuring\r\nmany advocates for his cause.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1762, when he had obtained a still greater store of\r\ninformation, he published a larger work. This, however, he entitle _A\r\nshort Account of that part of Africa inhabited by the Negroes_ In 1767\r\nhe published _A Caution and Warning to Great Britain and her colonies on\r\nthe calamitous state of the enslaved Negroes in the British Dominions_;\r\nand soon after this appeared, _An Historical Account of Guinea, its\r\nSituation, Produce, and the general Disposition of its Inhabitants: with\r\nan Inquiry into the Rise and Progress of the Slave Trade, its Nature,\r\nand Calamitous Effects._ This pamphlet contained a clear and distinct\r\ndevelopment of the subject, from the best authorities. It contained\r\nalso, the sentiments of many enlightened upon it; and it became\r\ninstrumental beyond any other book ever before published, in\r\ndisseminating a proper knowledge and detestation of this trade.\r\n\r\nAnthony Benezet may be considered as one of the most zealous, vigilant,\r\nand active advocates which the cause of the oppressed Africans ever had.\r\nHe seemed to have been born and to have lived for the promotion of it\r\nand therefore he never omitted any the least opportunity of serving it.\r\nIf a person called upon him who was going a journey his first thoughts\r\nusually were how he could make him an instrument in its favour; he\r\neither gave him tracts to distribute or he sent letters by him, or he\r\ngave him some commission on the subject; so that he was the means of\r\nemploying several persons at the same time, in various parts of America;\r\nin advancing the work he had undertaken.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner he availed himself of every other circumstance, as\r\nfar as he could, to the same end. When he heard that Mr. Granville Sharp\r\nhad obtained; in the year 1772, the noble verdict in the cause of\r\nSomerset the slave, he opened a correspondence with him which he kept\r\nup, that there might be an union of action between them for the future,\r\nas far as it could be effected, and that they might each give\r\nencouragement to the other to proceed.\r\n\r\nHe opened also a correspondence with George Whitfield and John Wesley\r\nthat these might assist him in promoting the cause of the oppressed.\r\n\r\nHe wrote also a letter to the Countess of Huntingdon on the following\r\nsubject:--She had founded a college, at the recommendation of George\r\nWhitfield, called the Orphan-house near Savannah, in Georgia, and had\r\nendowed it. The object of this institution was to furnish scholastic\r\ninstruction to the poor, and to prepare some of them for the ministry.\r\nGeorge Whitfield, ever attentive to the cause of the poor Africans,\r\nthought that this institution might have been useful to them also; but\r\nsoon after his death, they who succeeded him bought slaves, and these in\r\nunusual numbers to extend the rice and indigo plantations belonging to\r\nthe college. The letter then in question was written by Anthony Benezet,\r\nin order to lay before the Countess, as a religious woman, the misery\r\nshe was occasioning in Africa, by allowing the managers of her college\r\nin Georgia to give encouragement to the Slave Trade. The Countess\r\nreplied, that such a measure should never have her countenance, and that\r\nshe would take care to prevent it.\r\n\r\nOn discovering that the Abbé Raynal had brought out his celebrated work,\r\nin which he manifested a tender feeling in behalf of the injured\r\nAfricans, he entered into a correspondence with him, hoping to make him\r\nyet more useful to their cause.\r\n\r\nFinding, also, in the year 1783 that the Slave Trade, which had greatly\r\ndeclined during the American war, was reviving, he addressed a pathetic\r\nletter to our Queen, (as I mentioned in the last chapter,) who, on\r\nhearing the high character of the writer of it from Benjamin West,\r\nreceived it with marks of peculiar condescension and attention. The\r\nfollowing is a copy of it:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO CHARLOTTE, QUEEN OF GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n    Impressed with a sense of religious duty, and encouraged by the\r\n    opinion generally entertained of thy benevolent disposition to\r\n    succor the distressed, I take the liberty; very respectfully, to\r\n    offer to thy perusal some tracts, which, I believe, faithfully\r\n    describe the suffering condition of many hundred thousands of\r\n    our fellow-creatures of the African race, great numbers of whom,\r\n    rent from every tender connexion in life, are annually taken\r\n    from their native land; to endure, in the American islands and\r\n    plantations, a most rigorous and cruel slavery; whereby many,\r\n    very many of them, are brought to a melancholy and untimely end.\r\n\r\n    When it is considered that the inhabitants of Great Britain, who\r\n    are themselves so eminently blessed in the enjoyment of\r\n    religious and civil liberty, have long been, and yet are, very\r\n    deeply concerned in this flagrant violation of the common rights\r\n    of mankind, and that even its national authority is exerted in\r\n    support of the African Slave Trade, there is much reason to\r\n    apprehend that this has been, and, as long as the evil exists,\r\n    will continue to be, an occasion of drawing down the Divine\r\n    displeasure on the nation and its dependencies. May these\r\n    considerations induce thee to interpose thy kind endeavours in\r\n    behalf of this greatly injured people, whose abject situation\r\n    gives them an additional claim to the pity and assistance of the\r\n    generous mind, inasmuch as they are altogether deprived of the\r\n    means of soliciting effectual relief for themselves; that so\r\n    thou mayest not only be a blessed instrument in the hand of him\r\n    'by whom kings reign and princes decree justice,' to avert the\r\n    awful judgments by which the empire has already been so\r\n    remarkably shaken, but that the blessings of thousands ready to\r\n    perish may come upon thee, at a time when the superior\r\n    advantages attendant on thy situation in this world will no\r\n    longer be of any avail to thy consolation and support.\r\n\r\n    To the tracts on this subject to which I have thus ventured to\r\n    crave thy particular attention, I have added some which at\r\n    different times I have believed it my duty to publish[A], and\r\n    which, I trust, will afford thee some satisfaction, their design\r\n    being for the furtherance of that universal peace and good-will\r\n    amongst men, which the Gospel was intended to introduce.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: These related to the principles of the religious\r\n    society of the Quakers.]\r\n\r\n    \"I hope thou wilt kindly excuse the freedom used on this\r\n    occasion by an ancient man, whose mind, for more than forty\r\n    years past, has been much separated from the common intercourse\r\n    of the world, and long painfully exercised in the consideration\r\n    of the miseries under which so large a part of mankind, equally\r\n    with us the objects of redeeming love, are suffering the most\r\n    unjust and grievous oppression, and who sincerely desires thy\r\n    temporal and eternal felicity, and that of thy royal consort.\r\n\r\n    \"ANTHONY BENEZET.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony Benezet, besides the care he bestowed upon forwarding the cause\r\nof the oppressed Africans in different parts of the world, found time to\r\npromote the comforts, and improve the condition of those, in the state\r\nin which he lived. Apprehending that much advantage would arise both to\r\nthem and the public from instructing them in common learning, he\r\nzealously promoted the establishment of a school for that purpose. Much\r\nof the two last years of his life he devoted to a personal attendance on\r\nthis school, being earnestly desirous that they who came to it might be\r\nbetter qualified for the enjoyment of that freedom to which great\r\nnumbers of them had been then restored. To this he sacrificed the\r\nsuperior emoluments of his former school, and his bodily ease also,\r\nalthough the weakness of his constitution seemed to demand indulgence.\r\nBy his last will he directed, that, after the decease of his widow, his\r\nwhole little fortune (the savings of the industry of fifty years)\r\nshould, except a few very small legacies, be applied to the support of\r\nit. During his attendance upon it he had the happiness to find, (and his\r\nsituation enabled him to make the comparison,) that Providence had been\r\nequally liberal to the Africans in genius and talents as to other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days' illness, this excellent man died at Philadelphia, in\r\nthe spring of 1784. The interment of his remains was attended by several\r\nthousands of all ranks, professions, and parties, who united in\r\ndeploring their loss. The mournful procession was closed by some\r\nhundreds of those poor Africans who had been personally benefited by his\r\nlabours, and whose behaviour on the occasion showed the gratitude and\r\naffection they considered to be due to him as their own private\r\nbenefactor, as well as the benefactor of their whole race.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the labours of the Quakers in America; of individuals,\r\nfrom 1718 to 1784, and of the body at large, from 1696 to 1787, in this\r\ngreat cause of humanity and religion. Nor were the effects produced from\r\nthese otherwise than corresponding with what might have been expected\r\nfrom such an union of exertion in such a cause; for both the evils, that\r\nis, the evil of buying and selling, and the evil of using slaves, ceased\r\nat length with the members of this benevolent society. The leaving off\r\nall concern with the Slave Trade took place first. The abolition of\r\nslavery, though it followed, was not so speedily accomplished; for,\r\nbesides the loss of property, when slaves were manumitted, without any\r\npecuniary consideration in return, their owners had to struggle, in\r\nmaking them free, against the laws and customs of the times. In\r\nPennsylvania, where the law in this respect was the most favourable, the\r\nparties wishing to give freedom to a slave were obliged to enter into a\r\nbond for the payment of thirty pounds currency, in case the said slave\r\nshould become chargeable for maintenance. In New Jersey the terms were\r\nfar less favorable, as the estate of the owner remained liable to the\r\nconsequences of misconduct in the slave, or even in his posterity. In\r\nthe southern parts of America manumission was not permitted but on terms\r\namounting nearly to a prohibition. But, notwithstanding these\r\ndifficulties, the Quakers could not be deterred, as they became\r\nconvinced of the unlawfulness of holding men in bondage, from doing that\r\nwhich they believed to be right. Many liberated their slaves, whatever\r\nthe consequences were; and some gave the most splendid example in doing\r\nit, not only by consenting, as others did, thus to give up their\r\nproperty, and to incur the penalties of manumission, but by calculating\r\nand giving what was due to them, over and above their food and clothing,\r\nfor wages[A] from the beginning of their slavery to the day when their\r\nliberation commenced. Thus manumission went on, some sacrificing more;\r\nand others less; some granting it sooner, and others later; till, in the\r\nyear 1787[B] there was not a slave in the possession of an acknowledged\r\nQuaker.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: One of the brightest instances was that afforded by Warner\r\nMifflin. He gave unconditional liberty to his slaves. He paid all the\r\nadults, on their discharge, the sum, which arbitrators, mutually chosen,\r\nawarded them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Previously to the year 1787, several of the states had made\r\nthe terms of manumission more easy.]\r\n\r\nHaving given to the reader the history of the third class of forerunners\r\nand coadjutors, as it consisted of the Quakers in America, I am now to\r\ncontinue it, as it consisted of an union of these with others on the\r\nsame continent, in the year 1774, in behalf of the African race. To do\r\nthis, I shall begin with the causes which led to the production of this\r\ngreat event.\r\n\r\nAnd, in the first place, as example is more powerful than precept, we\r\ncannot suppose that the Quakers could have shown these noble instances\r\nof religious principle, without supposing also that individuals of other\r\nreligious denominations would be morally instructed by them. They who\r\nlived in the neighborhood where they took place, must have become\r\nacquainted with the motives which led to them. Some of them must at\r\nleast have praised the action, though they might not themselves have\r\nbeen ripe to follow the example: nor is it at all improbable that these\r\nmight be led, in the course of the workings of their own minds, to a\r\ncomparison between their own conduct and that of the Quakers on this\r\nsubject, in which they themselves might appear to be less worthy in\r\ntheir own eyes. And as there is sometimes a spirit of rivalship among\r\nthe individuals of religious sects, where the character of one is\r\nsounded forth as higher than that of another; this, if excited by such a\r\ncircumstance, would probably operate for good. It must have been\r\nmanifest also to many, after a lapse of time, that there was no danger\r\nin what the Quakers had done, and that there was even sound policy in\r\nthe measure. But, whatever were the several causes, certain it is, that\r\nthe example of the Quakers in leaving off all concern with the Slave\r\nTrade, and in liberating their slaves, (scattered, as they were, over\r\nvarious parts of America,) contributed to produce in many of a different\r\nreligious denomination from themselves, a more tender disposition than\r\nhad been usual towards the African race.\r\n\r\nBut a similar disposition towards these oppressed people was created in\r\nothers, by means of other circumstances or causes. In the early part of\r\nthe eighteenth century, Judge Sewell of New England came forward as a\r\nzealous advocate for them: he addressed a memorial to the legislature,\r\nwhich he called, _The Selling of Joseph_, and in which he pleaded their\r\ncause both as a lawyer and, a Christian. This memorial produced an\r\neffect upon many, but particularly upon those of his own persuasion; and\r\nfrom this time the Presbyterians appear to have encouraged a sympathy in\r\ntheir favour.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1739, the celebrated George Whitfield became an instrument\r\nin turning the attention of many others to their hard case, and of\r\nbegetting in these a fellow sympathy towards them. This laborious\r\nminister, having been deeply affected with what he had seen in the\r\ncourse of his religious travels in America, thought it his duty, to\r\naddress a letter from Georgia to the inhabitants of Maryland, Virginia,\r\nand North and South Carolina. This letter was printed in the year above\r\nmentioned, and is in part as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    As I lately passed through your provinces in my way hither, I\r\n    was sensibly touched with a fellow-feeling for the miseries of\r\n    the poor negroes. Whether it be lawful for Christians to buy\r\n    slaves, and thereby encourage the nations, from whom they are\r\n    bought, to be at perpetual war with each other, I shall not take\r\n    upon me to determine. Sure I am, it is sinful, when they have\r\n    bought them to use them as bad as though they were brutes, nay,\r\n    worse; and whatever particular exceptions there may be, (as I\r\n    would charitably hope there are some,) I fear the generality of\r\n    you who own negroes are liable to such a charge; for your\r\n    slaves, I believe, work as hard, if not harder, than the horses\r\n    whereon you ride. These, after they have done their work, are\r\n    fed and taken proper care of; but many negroes when wearied with\r\n    labour, in your plantations, have been obliged to grind their\r\n    corn after their return home: your dogs are caressed and fondled\r\n    at your table, but your slaves, who are frequently styled dogs\r\n    or beasts, have not an equal privilege; they are scarce\r\n    permitted to pick up the crumbs which fall from their master's\r\n    table: not to mention what numbers have been given up to the\r\n    inhuman usage of cruel taskmasters, who, by their unrelenting\r\n    scourges have ploughed their backs and made long furrows, and at\r\n    length brought them even unto death. When, passing along, I have\r\n    viewed your plantations cleared and cultivated, many spacious\r\n    houses built and the owners of them faring sumptuously every\r\n    day, my blood has frequently almost run cold within me, to\r\n    consider how many of your slaves had neither convenient food to\r\n    eat, nor proper raiment to put on, notwithstanding most of the\r\n    comforts you enjoy were solely owing to their indefatigable\r\n    labours.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter, from which this is an extract, produced a desirable effect\r\nupon many of those who perused it, but particularly upon such as began\r\nto be seriously disposed in these times. And as George Whitfield\r\ncontinued a firm friend to the poor Africans, never losing an\r\nopportunity of serving them, he interested, in the course of his useful\r\nlife, many thousands of his followers in their favour.\r\n\r\nTo this account it may be added, that from the year 1762 ministers, who\r\nwere in the connection of John Wesley, began to be settled in America,\r\nand that as these were friends to the oppressed Africans also, so they\r\ncontributed in their turn[A] to promote a softness of feeling towards\r\nthem among those of their own persuasion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It must not be forgotten, that the example of the Moravians\r\nhad its influence also in directing men to their duty towards these\r\noppressed people; for though, when they visited this part of the world\r\nfor their conversion, they never meddled with the political state of\r\nthings, by recommending it to masters to alter the condition of their\r\nslaves, as believing religion could give comfort in the most abject\r\nsituations in life, yet they uniformly freed those slaves who came into\r\ntheir own possession.]\r\n\r\nIn consequence then of these and other causes, a considerable number of\r\npersons of various religious denominations, had appeared at different\r\ntimes in America, besides the Quakers, who, though they had not\r\ndistinguished themselves by resolutions and manumissions as religious\r\nbodies, were yet highly friendly to the African cause. This friendly\r\ndisposition began to manifest itself about the year 1770; for when a few\r\nQuakers, as individuals, began at that time to form little associations\r\nin the middle provinces of North America, to discourage the introduction\r\nof slaves among people in their own neighbourhoods, who were not of\r\ntheir own Society, and to encourage the manumission of those already in\r\nbondage, they, were joined as colleagues by several persons of this\r\ndescription[A], who co-operated with them in the promotion of their\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It then appeared that individuals among those of the Church\r\nof England, Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, and others had\r\nbegun in a few instances to liberate their slaves.]\r\n\r\nThis disposition, however, became more manifest in the year 1772; for\r\nthe house of burgesses of Virginia presented a petition to the king,\r\nbeseeching his majesty to remove all those restraints on his governors\r\nof that colony, which inhibited their assent to such laws as might check\r\nthat inhuman and impolitic commerce, the Slave Trade: and it is\r\nremarkable, that the refusal of the British government to permit the\r\nVirginians to exclude slaves from among them by law, was enumerated\r\nafterwards among the public reasons for separating from the mother\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBut this friendly disposition was greatly increased in the year 1773, by\r\nthe literary labours of Dr. Benjamin Rush, of Philadelphia[B], who, I\r\nbelieve, is a member of the Presbyterian Church: for in this year, at\r\nthe instigation of Anthony Benezet, he took up the cause of the\r\noppressed Africans in a little work, which he entitled, _An Address to\r\nthe Inhabitants of the British Settlements, on the Slavery of the\r\nNegroes_; and soon afterwards in another, which was a vindication of the\r\nfirst, in answer to an acrimonious attach by a West Indian planter.\r\nThese publications contained many new observations; they were written in\r\na polished style; and while they exhibited the erudition and talents,\r\nthey showed the liberality and benevolence of the author. Having had a\r\nconsiderable circulation, they spread conviction among many, and\r\npromoted the cause for which they had been so laudably undertaken. Of\r\nthe great increase of friendly disposition towards the African cause in\r\nthis very year, we have this remarkable proof: that when the Quakers,\r\nliving in East and West Jersey, wished to petition the legislature to\r\nobtain an act of assembly for the more equitable manumission of slaves\r\nin that province, so many others of different persuasions joined them,\r\nthat the petition was signed by upwards of three thousand persons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Dr. Rush has been better known since for his other literary\r\nworks, such as his _Medical Dissertations_, his _Treatises on the\r\nDiscipline of Schools_, _Criminal Law_, &c.]\r\n\r\nBut in the next year, or in the year 1774[A], the increased good-will\r\ntowards the Africans became so apparent, but more particularly in\r\nPennsylvania, where the Quakers were more numerous than in any other\r\nstate, that they, who considered themselves more immediately as the\r\nfriends of these injured people, thought it right to avail themselves of\r\nit: and accordingly James Pemberton, one of the most conspicuous of the\r\nQuakers in Pennsylvania, and Dr. Rush, one of the most conspicuous of\r\nthose belonging to the various other religious communities in that\r\nprovince, undertook, in conjunction with others, the important task of\r\nbringing those into a society who were friendly to this cause. In this\r\nundertaking they succeeded. And hence arose that union of the Quakers\r\nwith others, to which I have been directing the attention of the reader,\r\nand by which the third class of forerunners and coadjutors becomes now\r\ncomplete. This society, which was confined to Pennsylvania, was the\r\nfirst ever formed in America, in which there was an union of persons of\r\ndifferent religious denominations in behalf of the African race.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: In this year, Elhanan Winchester, a supporter of the\r\ndoctrine of universal redemption, turned the attention of many of his\r\nhearers to this subject, both by private interference, and by preaching\r\nexpressly upon it.]\r\n\r\nBut this society had scarcely begun to act, when the war broke out\r\nbetween England and America, which had the effect of checking its\r\noperations. This was considered as a severe blow upon it. But as those\r\nthings which appear most to our disadvantage, turn out often the most to\r\nour benefit, so the war, by giving birth to the independence of America,\r\nwas ultimately favourable to its progress. For as this contrast had\r\nproduced during its continuance, so it left, when it was over, a general\r\nenthusiasm for liberty. Many talked of little else but of the freedom\r\nthey had gained. These were naturally led to the consideration of those\r\namong them who were groaning in bondage. They began to feel for their\r\nhard case. They began to think that they should not deserve the new\r\nblessing which they had acquired if they denied it to others. Thus the\r\ndiscussions, which originated in this contest, became the occasion of\r\nturning the attention of many, who might not otherwise have thought of\r\nit, towards the miserable condition of the slaves.\r\n\r\nNor were writers wanting, who, influenced by considerations on the war,\r\nand the independence resulting from it, made their works subservient to\r\nthe same benevolent end. A work, entitled _A Serious Address to the\r\nRulers of America on the Inconsistency of their Conduct respecting\r\nSlavery, forming a Contrast between the Encroachments of England on\r\nAmerican Liberty and American Injustice in tolerating Slavery_; which\r\nappeared in 1783, was particularly instrumental in producing this\r\neffect. This excited a more than usual attention to the case of these\r\noppressed people, and where most of all it could be useful; for the\r\nauthor compared in two opposite columns the animated speeches and\r\nresolutions of the members of congress in behalf of their own liberty\r\nwith their conduct in continuing slavery to others. Hence the\r\nlegislature began to feel the inconsistency of the practice; and so far\r\nhad the sense of this inconsistency spread there, that when the\r\ndelegates met from each state to consider of a federal union, there was\r\na desire that the abolition of the Slave Trade should be one of the\r\narticles in it. This was, however, opposed by the delegates from North\r\nand South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and Georgia, the five states\r\nwhich had the greatest concern in slaves. But even these offered to\r\nagree to the article, provided a condition was annexed to it, (which was\r\nafterwards done,) that the power of such abolition should not commence\r\nin the legislature till the 1st of January, 1808.\r\n\r\nIn consequence then of these different circumstances, the Society of\r\nPennsylvania, the object of which was \"for promoting the abolition of\r\nslavery and the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondage,\"\r\nbecame so popular, that in the year 1787 it was thought desirable to\r\nenlarge it. Accordingly several new members were admitted into it. The\r\ncelebrated Dr. Franklin, who had long warmly espoused the cause of the\r\ninjured Africans, was appointed president; James Pemberton and Jonathan\r\nPenrose were appointed vice-presidents; Dr. Benjamin Rush and Tench\r\nCoxe, secretaries; James Star, treasurer; William Lewis, John D. Coxe,\r\nMiers Fisher, and William Rawle, counsellors; Thomas Harrison, Nathan\r\nBoys, James Whiteall, James Reed, John Todd, Thomas Armatt, Norris\r\nJones, Samuel Richards, Francis Bayley, Andrew Carson, John Warner, and\r\nJacob Shoemaker, junior, an electing committee; and Thomas Shields,\r\nThomas Parker, John Oldden, William Zane, John Warner, and William\r\nMcElhenny, an acting committee for carrying on the purposes of the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nI shall now only observe further upon this subject, that as a society,\r\nconsisting of an union of the Quakers, with others of other religious\r\ndenominations, was established for Pennsylvania in behalf of the\r\noppressed Africans; so different societies, consisting each of a similar\r\nunion of persons, were established in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, and other states for the same object, and that these\r\nafterwards held a correspondence and personal communion with each other\r\nfor the promotion of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nObservations on the three classes already introduced.--Coincidence of\r\nextraordinary circumstances.--Individuals in each of these classes,\r\nwho seem to have had an education as it were to qualify them for\r\npromoting the cause of the abolition; Sharp and Ramsay in the first;\r\nDillwyn in the second; Pemberton and Rush in the third.--These, with\r\ntheir respective classes, acted on motives of their own, and\r\nindependently of each other; and yet, from circumstances neither\r\nforeseen nor known by them, they were in the way of being easily\r\nunited in 1787.--William Dillwyn, the great medium of connexion\r\nbetween them all.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the reader will refer to his recollection, he will find that I have\r\ngiven the history of three of the classes of the forerunners and\r\ncoadjutors in the great cause of the abolition of the Slave Trade up to\r\nthe time proposed. He will of course expect that I should proceed with\r\nthe history of the fourth. But, as I foresee that, by making certain\r\nobservations upon the classes already introduced in the present, rather\r\nthan in any future, place, I shall be able to give him clearer views on\r\nthe subject, I shall postpone the history of the remaining class to the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\nThe account which I shall now give, will exhibit a concurrence of\r\nextraordinary and important circumstances. It will show, first, that in\r\neach of the three classes now introduced, there were individuals, in the\r\nyear 1787, who had been educated as it were for the purpose of becoming\r\npeculiarly qualified to act together for the promotion of the abolition\r\nof the Slave Trade. It will show, secondly, that these, with their\r\nrespective classes, acted upon their own principles, distinctly and\r\nindependently of each other. And lastly, that by means of circumstances,\r\nwhich they themselves had neither foreseen nor contrived, a junction\r\nbetween them was rendered easily practicable, and that it was beginning\r\nto take place at the period assigned.\r\n\r\nThe first class of forerunners and coadjutors consisted principally, as\r\nit has appeared, of persons in England of various descriptions. These, I\r\nmay observe, had no communication with each other as to any plan for the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade. There were two individuals, however, among\r\nthem who were more conspicuous than the rest, namely, Granville Sharp,\r\nthe first labourer, and Mr. Ramsay, the first controversial writer, in\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nThat Granville Sharp received an education as if to become qualified to\r\nunite with others, in the year 1787, for this important object, must\r\nhave, appeared from the history of his labours, as detailed in several\r\nof the preceding pages. The same may be said of Mr. Ramsay; for it has\r\nalready appeared that he lived in the island of St. Christopher, where\r\nhe made his observations, and studied the laws, relative to the\r\ntreatment of slaves, for nineteen years.\r\n\r\nThat Granville Sharp acted on grounds distinct from those in any of the\r\nother classes is certain. For he knew nothing at this time either of the\r\nQuakers in England or of those in America, any more than that they\r\nexisted by name. Had it not been for the case of Jonathan Strong, he\r\nmight never have attached himself to the cause. A similar account may be\r\ngiven of Mr. Ramsay; for, if it had not been for what he had seen in the\r\nisland of St. Christopher, he had never embarked in it. It was from\r\nscenes, which he had witnessed there, that he began to feel on the\r\nsubject. These feelings he communicated to others on his return to\r\nEngland, and these urged him into action.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the second class, the reader will recollect that it\r\nconsisted of the Quakers in England: first, of George Fox; then of the\r\nQuakers as a body; then of individuals belonging to that body, who\r\nformed themselves into a committee, independently of it, for the\r\npromotion of the object in question. This committee, it may he\r\nremembered, consisted of six persons, of whom one was William Dillwyn.\r\n\r\nThat William Dillwyn became fitted for the station, which he was\r\nafterwards to take, will be seen shortly. He was born in America, and\r\nwas a pupil of the venerable Benezet, who took pains very early to\r\ninterest his feelings on this great subject. Benezet employed him\r\noccasionally, I mean in a friendly manner, as his amanuensis, to copy\r\nhis manuscripts for publication, as well as several of his letters\r\nwritten in behalf of the cause. This gave his scholar an insight into\r\nthe subject; who, living besides in the land where both the Slave Trade\r\nand slavery were established, obtained an additional knowledge of them,\r\nso as to be able to refute many of those objections, to which others,\r\nfor want of local observation, could never have replied.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1772, Anthony Benezet introduced William Dillwyn by letter\r\nto several of the principal people of Carolina, with whom he had himself\r\ncorresponded on the sufferings of the poor Africans, and desired him to\r\nhave interviews with them on the subject. He charged him also to be very\r\nparticular in making observations as to what he should see there. This\r\njourney was of great use to the latter, in fixing him as the friend of\r\nthese oppressed people; for he saw so much of their cruel treatment in\r\nthe course of it, that he felt an anxiety ever afterwards, amounting to\r\na duty, to do every thing in his power for their relief.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1773, William Dillwyn, in conjunction with Richard Smith and\r\nDaniel Wells, two of his own society, wrote a pamphlet in answer to\r\narguments then prevailing, that the manumission of slaves would be\r\ninjurious. This pamphlet--which was entitled, _Brief Considerations on\r\nSlavery, and the Expediency of its Abolition; with some Hints on the\r\nMeans whereby it may be gradually effected_,--proved that in lieu of the\r\nusual security required, certain sums paid at the several periods of\r\nmanumission would amply secure the public, as well as the owners of the\r\nslaves, from any future burdens. In the same year also, when the\r\nsociety, joined by several hundreds of others in New Jersey, presented a\r\npetition to the legislature, (as mentioned in the former chapter,) to\r\nobtain an act of assembly for the more equitable manumission of slaves\r\nin that province, William Dillwyn was one of a deputation, which was\r\nheard at the bar of the assembly for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, he came to England, but his attention was still kept alive to\r\nthe subject; for he was the person by whom Anthony Benezet sent his\r\nletter to the Countess of Huntingdon, as before related. He was also the\r\nperson to whom the same venerable defender of the African race sent his\r\nletter, before spoken of, to be forwarded to the Queen.\r\n\r\nThat William Dillwyn, and those of his own class in England, acted upon\r\nmotives very distinct from those of the former class, may be said with\r\ntruth; for they acted upon the constitutional principles of their own\r\nsociety, as incorporated into its discipline: which principles would\r\nalways have incited them to the subversion of slavery, as far as they\r\nthemselves were concerned, whether any other person had abolished it or\r\nnot. To which it may be added, as a further proof of the originality of\r\ntheir motives, that the Quakers have had, ever since their institution\r\nas a religious body, but little intercourse with the world.\r\n\r\nThe third class, to which I now come, consisted, as we have seen, first\r\nof the Quakers in America; and secondly, of an union, of these with\r\nothers on the same continent. The principal individuals concerned in\r\nthis union were James Pemberton and Dr. Rush. The former of these,\r\nhaving taken an active part in several of the yearly meetings of his own\r\nsociety relative to the oppressed Africans, and having been in habits of\r\nintimacy and friendship with John Woolman and Anthony Benezet, with the\r\nresult of whose labours he was acquainted, may be supposed to have\r\nbecome qualified to take a leading station in the promotion of their\r\ncause. Dr. Rush also had shown himself, as has appeared, an able\r\nadvocate, and had even sustained a controversy in their favour. That the\r\ntwo last mentioned acted also on motives of their own, or independently\r\nof those belonging to the other two classes, when they formed their\r\nassociation in Pennsylvania, will be obvious from these circumstances;\r\nfirst, that most of those of the first class, who contributed to throw\r\nthe greatest light and odium upon the Slave Trade, had not then made\r\ntheir public appearance in the world. And, with respect to the second\r\nclass, the little committee belonging to it had neither been formed nor\r\nthought of.\r\n\r\nAnd as the individuals in each of the three classes, who have now been\r\nmentioned, had an education as it were to qualify them for acting\r\ntogether in this great cause, and had moved independently of each other;\r\nso it will appear that, by means of circumstances, which they themselves\r\nhad neither foreseen nor contrived, a junction between them was rendered\r\neasily practicable, and that it was beginning to take place at the\r\nperiod assigned.\r\n\r\nTo show this, I must first remind the reader, that Anthony Benezet, as\r\nsoon as he heard of the result of the case of Somerset, opened a\r\ncorrespondence with Granville Sharp, which was kept up to the\r\nencouragement of both. In the year 1774, when he learned that William\r\nDillwyn was going to England, he gave him letters to that gentleman.\r\nThus one of the most conspicuous of the second class was introduced,\r\naccidentally as it were, to one of the most conspicuous of the first. In\r\nthe year 1775, William Dillwyn went back to America, but, on his return\r\nto England to settle, he renewed his visits to Granville Sharp. Thus the\r\nconnexion was continued. To these observations I may now add, that\r\nSamuel Hoare, of the same class as William Dillwyn, had, in consequence\r\nof the Bishop of Chester's sermon, begun a correspondence in 1784, as\r\nbefore mentioned, with Mr. Ramsay, who was of the same class as Mr.\r\nSharp. Thus four individuals of the two first classes were in the way of\r\nan union with one another.\r\n\r\nBut circumstances equally natural contributed to render an union between\r\nthe members of the second and the third classes easily practicable also.\r\nFor what was more natural than that William Dillwyn, who was born and\r\nwho had resided long in America, should have connexions there? He had\r\nlong cultivated a friendship (not then knowing to what it would lead)\r\nwith James Pemberton. His intimacy with him was like that of a family\r\nconnexion. They corresponded together; they corresponded also as kindred\r\nhearts, relative to the Slave Trade. Thus two members of the second and\r\nthird classes had opened an intercourse on the subject and thus was\r\nWilliam Dillwyn the great medium, through whom the members of the two\r\nclasses now mentioned, as well as the members of all the three, might be\r\neasily united also, if a fit occasion should offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFourth class of forerunners and coadjutors up to 1787.--Dr.\r\nPeckard, vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, the first of\r\nthese; gives out the Slave Trade as the subject for one of the annual\r\nprizes.--Author writes and obtains the first of these; reads his\r\nDissertation in the Senate-house in the summer of 1785; his feelings on\r\nthe subject during his return home; is desirous of aiding the cause of\r\nthe Africans, but sees great difficulties; determines to publish his\r\nprize essay for this purpose; is accidentally thrown into the way of\r\nJames Phillips, who introduces him to W. Dillwyn, the connecting medium\r\nof the three classes before mentioned; and to G. Sharp and Mr. Ramsay,\r\nand to R. Phillips.\r\n\r\n\r\nI proceed now to the fourth class of forerunners and coadjutors up to\r\nthe year 1787 in the great cause of the abolition of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was Dr. Peckard. This gentleman had distinguished\r\nhimself in the earlier part of his life by certain publications on the\r\nintermediate state of the soul, and by others in favour of civil and\r\nreligious liberty. To the latter cause he was a warm friend, seldom\r\nomitting any opportunity of declaring his sentiments in its favour. In\r\nthe course of his preferment he was appointed by Sir John Griffin,\r\nafterwards Lord Howard of Walden, to the mastership of Magdalen College\r\nin the University of Cambridge. In this high office he considered it to\r\nbe his duty to support those doctrines which he had espoused when in an\r\ninferior station; and accordingly, when in the year 1784 it devolved\r\nupon him to preach a sermon, before the University of Cambridge, he\r\nchose his favourite subject: in the handling of which he took an\r\nopportunity of speaking of the Slave Trade in the following nervous\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Now, whether we consider the crime with respect to the\r\n    individuals concerned in this most barbarous and cruel traffic,\r\n    or whether we consider it as patronized and encouraged by the\r\n    laws of the land, it presents to our view an equal degree of\r\n    enormity. A crime, founded on a dreadful pre-eminence in\r\n    wickedness--a crime, which being both of individuals and the\r\n    nation, must sometime draw down upon us the heaviest judgment of\r\n    Almighty God, who made of one blood all the sons of men, and who\r\n    gave to all equally a natural right to liberty; and who, ruling\r\n    all the kingdoms of the earth with equal providential justice,\r\n    cannot suffer such deliberate, such monstrous iniquity, to pass\r\n    long unpunished.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Peckard did not consider this delivery of his testimony, though\r\nit was given before a learned and religious body, as a sufficient\r\ndischarge of his duty, while any opportunity remained of renewing it\r\nwith effect. And, as such an one offered in the year 1785, when he was\r\nvice-chancellor of the University, he embraced it. In consequence of his\r\noffice, it devolved upon him to give out two subjects for Latin\r\ndissertations, one to the middle bachelors, and the other to the senior\r\nbachelors of arts. They who produced the best were to obtain the prizes.\r\nTo the latter he proposed the following: _Anne liceat Invitos in\r\nServitutem dare?_ or, _Is it right to make slaves of others against\r\ntheir will?_\r\n\r\nThis circumstance of giving out subjects for the prizes, though only an\r\nordinary measure, became the occasion of my own labours, or of the real\r\nhonour which I feel in being able to consider myself as the next\r\ncoadjutor of this class in the cause of the injured Africans. For it\r\nhappened in this year that, being of the order of senior bachelors, I\r\nbecame qualified to write. I had gained a prize for the best Latin\r\ndissertation in the former year, and, therefore, it was expected that I\r\nshould obtain one in the present, or I should be considered as having\r\nlost my reputation both in the eyes of the University and of my own\r\nCollege. It had happened also, that I had been honoured with the first\r\nof the prizes[A], in that year, and therefore it was expected again,\r\nthat I should obtain the first on this occasion. The acquisition of the\r\nsecond, however honourable, would have been considered as a falling off,\r\nor as a loss of former fame. I felt myself, therefore, particularly\r\ncalled upon to maintain my post. And, with feelings of this kind, I\r\nbegan to prepare myself for the question.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: There are two prizes on each subject, one for the best and\r\nthe other for the second-best essays.]\r\n\r\nIn studying the thesis, I conceived it to point directly to the African\r\nSlave Trade, and more particularly as I knew that Dr. Peckard, in the\r\nsermon which I have mentioned, had pronounced so warmly against it. At\r\nany rate, I determined to give it this construction. But, alas! I was\r\nwholly ignorant of this subject; and, what was unfortunate, a few weeks\r\nonly were allowed for the composition. I was determined, however, to\r\nmake the best use of my time. I got access to the manuscript papers of a\r\ndeceased friend, who had been in the trade. I was acquainted also with\r\nseveral officers who had been in the West Indies, and from these I\r\ngained something. But I still felt myself at a loss for materials, and I\r\ndid not know where to get them; when going by accident into a friend's\r\nhouse, I took up a newspaper then lying on his table. One of the\r\narticles which attracted my notice, was an advertisement of ANTHONY\r\nBENEZET'S _Historical Account of Guinea_. I soon left my friend and his\r\npaper, and, to lose no time, hastened to London to buy it. In this\r\nprecious book I found almost all I wanted. I obtained, by means of it, a\r\nknowledge of, and access to, the great authorities of Adanson, Moore,\r\nBarbot, Smith, Bosman, and others. It was of great consequence to know\r\nwhat these persons had said upon this subject. For, having been\r\nthemselves either long resident in Africa, or very frequently there,\r\ntheir knowledge of it could not be questioned. Having been concerned\r\nalso in the trade, it was not likely that they would criminate\r\nthemselves more than they could avoid. Writing too at a time when the\r\nabolition was not even thought of, they could not have been biassed with\r\nany view to that event. And, lastly, having been dead many years, they\r\ncould not have been influenced, as living evidences may be supposed to\r\nhave been, either to conceal or exaggerate, as their own interest might\r\nlead them, either by being concerned in the continuance of the trade, or\r\nby supporting the opinions of those of their patrons in power, who were\r\non the different sides of this question.\r\n\r\nFurnished then in this manner, I began my work. But no person can tell\r\nthe severe trial which the writing of it proved to me. I had expected\r\npleasure from the invention of the arguments, from the arrangement of\r\nthem, from the putting of them together, and from the thought in the\r\ninterim that I was engaged in an innocent contest for literary honour.\r\nBut, all my pleasure was damped by the facts which were now continually\r\nbefore me. It was but one gloomy subject from morning to night. In the\r\nday-time I was uneasy. In the night I had little rest. I sometimes never\r\nclosed my eye-lids for grief. It became now not so much a trial for\r\nacademical reputation, as for the production of a work, which might be\r\nuseful to injured Africa. And keeping this idea in my mind ever after\r\nthe perusal of Benezet, I always slept with a candle in my room, that I\r\nmight rise out of my bed and put down such thoughts as might occur to me\r\nin the night, if I judged them valuable, conceiving that no arguments of\r\nany moment should be lost in so great a cause. Having at length finished\r\nthis painful task, I sent my Essay to the vice-chancellor, and soon\r\nafterwards found myself honoured as before with the first prize.\r\n\r\nAs it is usual to read these Essays publicly in the senate-house soon\r\nafter the prize is adjudged, I was called to Cambridge for this purpose.\r\nI went and performed my office. On returning however to London, the\r\nsubject of it almost wholly engrossed my thoughts. I became at times\r\nvery seriously affected while upon the road. I stopped my horse\r\noccasionally, and dismounted and walked. I frequently tried to persuade\r\nmyself in these intervals that the contents of my Essay could not be\r\ntrue. The more, however, I reflected upon them, or rather upon the\r\nauthorities on which they were founded, the more I gave them credit.\r\nComing in sight of Wades Mill, in Hertfordshire, I sat down disconsolate\r\non the turf by the roadside and held my horse. Here a thought came into\r\nmy mind, that if the contents of the Essay were true, it was time some\r\nperson should see these calamities to their end. Agitated in this\r\nmanner, I reached home. This was in the summer of 1785.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the autumn of the same year I experienced similar\r\nimpressions. I walked frequently into the woods, that I might think on\r\nthe subject in solitude, and find relief to my mind there. But there the\r\nquestion still recurred, \"Are these things true?\" Still the answer\r\nfollowed as instantaneously \"They are.\" Still the result accompanied it,\r\n\"Then surely some person should interfere.\" I then began to envy those\r\nwho had seats in parliament, and who had great riches, and widely\r\nextended connexions, which would enable them to take up this cause.\r\nFinding scarcely any one at that time who thought of it, I was turned\r\nfrequently to myself. But here many difficulties arose. It struck me,\r\namong others, that a young man of only twenty-four years of age could\r\nnot have that solid judgment or knowledge of men, manners, and things,\r\nwhich were requisite to qualify him to undertake a task of such\r\nmagnitude and importance;--and with whom was I to unite? I believed\r\nalso, that it looked so much like one of the feigned labours of\r\nHercules, that my understanding would be suspected if I proposed it. On\r\nruminating, however, on the subject, I found one thing at least\r\npracticable, and that this also was in my power. I could translate my\r\nLatin dissertation. I could enlarge it usefully. I could see how the\r\npublic received it, or how far they were likely to favour any serious\r\nmeasures, which should have a tendency to produce the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade. Upon this then I determined; and in the middle of the month\r\nof November 1785, I began my work.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of January, I had finished half of it, though I had made\r\nconsiderable additions. I now thought of engaging with some bookseller\r\nto print it when finished. For this purpose I called upon Mr. Cadell, in\r\nthe Strand, and consulted him about it. He said that as the original\r\nessay had been honoured by the University of Cambridge with the first\r\nprize, this circumstance would insure it a respectable circulation among\r\npersons of taste. I own I was not much pleased with his opinion. I\r\nwished the essay to find its way among useful people, and among such as\r\nwould act and think with me. Accordingly I left Mr. Cadell, after having\r\nthanked him for his civility, and determined, as I thought I had time\r\nsufficient before dinner, to call upon a friend in the city. In going\r\npast the Royal Exchange, Mr. Joseph Hancock, one of the religious\r\nsociety of the Quakers, and with whose family my own had been long\r\nunited in friendship, suddenly met me. He first accosted me by saying\r\nthat I was the person whom he was wishing to see. He then asked me why I\r\nhad not published my prize essay. I asked him in return what had made\r\nhim think of that subject in particular. He replied that his own society\r\nhad long taken it up as a religious body, and individuals among them\r\nwere wishing to find me out. I asked him who. He answered, James\r\nPhillips, a bookseller, in Georgeyard, Lombard-street, and William\r\nDillwyn, of Walthamstow, and others. Having but little time to spare, I\r\ndesired him to introduce me to one of them. In a few minutes he took me\r\nto James Phillips, who was then the only one of them in town; by whose\r\nconversation I was so much interested and encouraged, that without any\r\nfurther hesitation I offered him the publication of my work. This\r\naccidental introduction of me to James Phillips was, I found afterwards,\r\na most happy circumstance for the promotion of the cause which I had\r\nthen so deeply at heart, as it led me to the knowledge of several of\r\nthose, who became afterwards material coadjutors in it. It was also of\r\ngreat importance to me with respect to the work itself: for he possessed\r\nan acute penetration, a solid judgment, and a literary knowledge, which\r\nhe proved by the many alterations and additions he proposed; and which I\r\nbelieve I uniformly adopted, after mature consideration, from a sense of\r\ntheir real value. It was advantageous to me also, inasmuch as it led me\r\nto his friendship, which was never interrupted but by his death.\r\n\r\nOn my second visit to James Phillips, at which time I brought him about\r\nhalf my manuscript for the press, I desired him to introduce me to\r\nWilliam Dillwyn, as he also had mentioned him to me on my first visit,\r\nand as I had not seen Mr. Hancock since. Matters were accordingly\r\narranged, and a day appointed before I left him. On this day I had my\r\nfirst interview with my new friend. Two or three others of his own\r\nreligious society were present, but who they were, I do not now\r\nrecollect. There seemed to be a great desire among them to know the\r\nmotive, by which I had been actuated in contending for the prize. I told\r\nthem frankly that I had no motive but that which, other young men in the\r\nUniversity had on such occasions; namely, the wish of being\r\ndistinguished, or of obtaining literary honour; but that I had felt so\r\ndeeply on the subject of it, that I had lately interested myself in it\r\nfrom a motive of duty. My conduct seemed to be highly approved by those\r\npresent, and much conversation ensued, but it was of a general nature.\r\n\r\nAs William Dillwyn wished very much to see me at his house at\r\nWalthamstow, I appointed the 13th of March to spend the day with them\r\nthere. We talked for the most part, during my stay, on the subject of my\r\nessay. I soon discovered the treasure I had met with in his local\r\nknowledge, both of the Slave Trade and of slavery, as they existed in\r\nthe United States; and I gained from him several facts, which, with his\r\npermission, I afterwards inserted in my work. But how surprised was I to\r\nhear, in the course of our conversation, of the labours of Granville\r\nSharp, of the writings of Ramsay, and of the controversy in which the\r\nlatter was engaged, of all which I had hitherto known nothing! How\r\nsurprised was I to learn that William Dillwyn himself had, two years\r\nbefore, associated himself with five others for the purpose of\r\nenlightening the public mind upon this great subject! How astonished was\r\nI to find that a society had been formed in America for the same object,\r\nwith some of the principal members of which he was intimately\r\nacquainted! And how still more astonished at the inference which\r\ninstantly rushed upon my mind, that he was capable of being made the\r\ngreat medium of connexion between them all. These thoughts almost\r\noverpowered me. I believe that after this I talked but little more to my\r\nfriend. My mind was overwhelmed with the thought that I had been\r\nprovidentially directed to his house; that the finger of Providence was\r\nbeginning to be discernible; that the day-star of African liberty was\r\nrising, and that probably I might be permitted to become an humble\r\ninstrument in promoting it.\r\n\r\nIn the course of attending to my work, as now in the press, James\r\nPhillips introduced me also to Granville Sharp, with whom I had\r\nafterwards many interesting interviews from time to time, and whom I\r\ndiscovered to be a distant relation by my father's side.\r\n\r\nHe introduced me also by letter to a correspondence with Mr. Ramsay, who\r\nin a short time afterwards came to London to see me.\r\n\r\nHe introduced me also to his cousin, Richard Phillips, of Lincoln's Inn,\r\nwho was at that time, on the point of joining the religious society of\r\nQuakers. In him I found much sympathy, and a willingness to co-operate\r\nwith me. When dull and disconsolate, he encouraged me. When in spirits,\r\nhe stimulated me further. Him I am now to mention as a new, but soon\r\nafterwards as an active and indefatigable, coadjutor in the cause. But I\r\nshall say more concerning him in a future chapter. I shall only now add\r\nthat my work was at length printed; that it was entitled _An Essay on\r\nthe Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, particularly the African,\r\ntranslated from a Latin Dissertation, which was honoured with the first\r\nPrize in the University of Cambridge, for the year 1785; with\r\nAdditions_; and that it was ushered into the world in the month of June,\r\n1786, or in about a year after it had been read in the Senate-house in\r\nits first form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nContinuation of the fourth class of forerunners and coadjutors up to\r\n1787; Bennet Langton; Dr. Baker; Lord and Lady Scarsdale.--Author\r\nvisits Ramsay at Teston.--Lady Middleton and Sir Charles (afterward\r\nLord Barham).--Author declares himself at the house of the latter\r\nready now to devote himself to the cause; reconsiders this declaration\r\nor pledge; his reasoning and struggle upon it; persists in it; returns\r\nto London; and pursues the work as now a business of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had purposed, as I said before, when I determined to publish my essay,\r\nto wait to see how the world would receive it, or what disposition there\r\nwould be in the public to favour my measures for the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade. But the conversation which I had held on the 13th of March\r\nwith William Dillwyn, continued to make such an impression upon me, that\r\nI thought now there could be no occasion for waiting for such a purpose.\r\nIt seemed now only necessary to go forward. Others I found had already\r\nbegun the work. I had been thrown suddenly among these, as into a new\r\nworld of friends. I believed, also, that a way was opening under\r\nProvidence for support; and I now thought that nothing remained for me\r\nbut to procure as many coadjutors as I could.\r\n\r\nI had long had the honour of the friendship of Mr. Bennet Langton, and I\r\ndetermined to carry him one of my books, and to interest his feelings in\r\nit, with a view of procuring his assistance in the cause. Mr. Langton\r\nwas a gentleman of an ancient family and respectable fortune in\r\nLincolnshire, but resided then in Queen Square, Westminster. He was\r\nknown as the friend of Dr. Johnson, Jonas Hanway, Edmund Burke, Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds, and others. Among his acquaintance, indeed, were most\r\nof the literary, and eminent professional, and public-spirited men of\r\nthe times. At court, also, he was well known, and had the esteem of his\r\nmajesty (George III.), with whom he frequently conversed. His friends\r\nwere numerous also, in both houses of the legislature. As to himself, he\r\nwas much noted for his learning, but most of all for the great example\r\nhe gave, with respect to the usefulness and integrity of his life.\r\n\r\nBy introducing my work to the sanction of a friend of such high\r\ncharacter and extensive connexions, I thought I should be doing great\r\nthings. And so the event proved. For when I went to him after he had\r\nread it, I found that it had made a deep impression upon his mind. As a\r\nfriend to humanity, he lamented over the miseries of the oppressed\r\nAfricans; and over the crimes of their tyrants, as a friend to morality\r\nand religion. He cautioned me, however, against being too sanguine in my\r\nexpectations, as so many thousands were interested in continuing the\r\ntrade. Justice, however, which he said weighed with him beyond all\r\nprivate or political interest, demanded a public inquiry, and he would\r\nassist me to the utmost of his power in my attempts towards it. From\r\nthis time he became a zealous and active coadjutor in the cause, and\r\ncontinued so to the end of his valuable life.\r\n\r\nThe next person, to whom I gave my work with a like view, was Dr. Baker,\r\na clergyman of the Establishment, and with whom I had been in habits of\r\nintimacy for some time. Dr. Baker was a learned and pious man. He had\r\nperformed the duties of his profession, from the time of his initiation\r\ninto the church, in an exemplary manner; not only by paying a proper\r\nattention to the customary services, but by the frequent visitation of\r\nthe sick and the instruction of the poor. This he had done, too, to\r\nadmiration in a particularly extensive parish. At the time I knew him,\r\nhe had May-Fair Chapel, of which an unusual portion of the congregation\r\nconsisted then of persons of rank and fortune. With most of these he had\r\na personal acquaintance. This was of great importance to me in the\r\npromotion of my views.  Having left him my book for a month, I called\r\nupon him. The result was that which I expected from so good a man. He,\r\ndid not wait for me to ask him for his co-operation, but he offered his\r\nservices in any way which I might think most eligible; feeling it his\r\nduty, as he expressed it, to become an instrument in exposing such a\r\ncomplication of guilt and misery to the world. Dr. Baker became from\r\nthis time an active coadjutor also, and continued so to his death.\r\n\r\nThe person to whom I sent my work next, was the late Lord Scarsdale,\r\nwhose family I had known for about two years. Both he and his lady read\r\nit with attention. They informed me, after the perusal of it, that both\r\nof them were desirous of assisting me in promoting the cause of the poor\r\nAfricans. Lady Scarsdale lamented that she might possibly offend near\r\nand dear connexions, who had interests in, the West Indies, by so doing;\r\nbut that, conscious of no intention to offend these, and considering the\r\nduties of religion to be the first to be attended to, she should be\r\npleased to become useful in so good a cause. Lord Scarsdale also assured\r\nme, that, if the subject should ever come before the House of Lords, it\r\nshould have his constant support.\r\n\r\nWhile attempting to make friends in this manner, I received a letter\r\nfrom Mr. Ramsay, with an invitation to spend a month at his house at\r\nTeston, near Maidstone, in Kent. This I accepted, that I might\r\ncommunicate to him the progress I had made, that I might gain more\r\nknowledge from him on the subject, and that I might acquire new strength\r\nand encouragement to proceed. On hearing my account of my proceedings,\r\nwhich I detailed to him on the first evening of our meeting, he seemed\r\nalmost overpowered with joy. He said he had been long of opinion that\r\nthe release of the Africans from the scourges of this cruel trade was\r\nwithin the determined views of Providence, and that by turning the\r\npublic attention to their misery, we should be the instruments of\r\nbeginning the good work. He then informed me how long he himself had had\r\ntheir cause at heart; that communicating his feelings to Sir Charles\r\nMiddleton (afterwards Lord Barham) and his lady, the latter had urged\r\nhim to undertake a work in their behalf; that her importunities were\r\ngreat respecting it; and that he had on this account, and in obedience\r\nalso to his own feelings, as has been before mentioned, begun it; but\r\nthat, foreseeing the censure and abuse which such a subject, treated in\r\nany possible manner, must bring upon the author, he had laid it aside\r\nfor some time. He had, however, resumed it at the solicitation of Dr.\r\nPorteus, then Bishop of Chester; after which, in the year 1784, it made\r\nits appearance in the world.\r\n\r\nI was delighted with this account on the first evening of my arrival;\r\nbut more particularly, as I collected from it that I might expect in the\r\nBishop of Chester and Sir Charles Middleton two new friends to the\r\ncause. This expectation was afterwards fully realized, as the reader\r\nwill see in its proper place. But I was still more delighted, when I was\r\ninformed that Sir Charles and Lady Middleton, with Mrs. Bouverie, lived\r\nat Teston Hall, in a park which was but a few yards from the house in\r\nwhich I then was. In the morning I desired an introduction to them,\r\nwhich accordingly took place, and I found myself much encouraged and\r\nsupported by this visit.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, nor indeed is there room, to detail my employments\r\nin this village, or the lonely walks I took there, or the meditations of\r\nmy mind at such seasons. I will therefore come at once to a particular\r\noccurrence. When at dinner one day with the family at Teston Hall, I was\r\nmuch pleased with the turn which the conversation had taken on the\r\nsubject, and in the joy of my heart I exclaimed, that \"I was ready to\r\ndevote myself to the cause.\" This brought great commendation from those\r\npresent; and Sir Charles Middleton added, that if I wanted any\r\ninformation in the course of my future inquiries relative to Africa,\r\nwhich he could procure me as comptroller of the navy, such as extracts\r\nfrom the journals of the ships of war to that continent, or from other\r\npapers, I should have free access to his office. This offer I received\r\nwith thankfulness, and it operated as a new encouragement to me to\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when I awoke, one of the first things that struck me\r\nwas, that I had given a pledge to the company the day before that I\r\nwould devote myself to the cause of the oppressed Africans. I became a\r\nlittle uneasy at this. I questioned whether I had considered matters\r\nsufficiently to be able to go so far with propriety. I determined\r\ntherefore to give the subject a full consideration, and accordingly I\r\nwalked to the place of my usual meditations,--the woods.\r\n\r\nHaving now reached a place of solitude, I began to balance everything on\r\nboth sides of the question. I considered first, that I had not yet\r\nobtained information sufficient on the subject to qualify me for the\r\nundertaking of such a work. But I reflected, on the other hand, that Sir\r\nCharles Middleton had just opened to me a new source of knowledge; that\r\nI should be backed by the local information of Dillwyn and Ramsay; and\r\nthat surely, by taking pains, I could acquire more.\r\n\r\nI then considered that I had not yet a sufficient number of friends to\r\nsupport me. This occasioned me to review them. I had now Sir Charles\r\nMiddleton, who was in the House of Commons. I was sure of Dr. Porteus,\r\nwho was in the House of Lords. I could count upon Lord Scarsdale, who\r\nwas a peer also. I had secured Mr. Langton, who had a most extensive\r\nacquaintance with members of both houses of the legislature. I had also\r\nsecured Dr. Baker, who had similar connexions. I could depend upon\r\nGranville Sharp, James Phillips, Richard Phillips, Ramsay, Dillwyn, and\r\nthe little committee to which he belonged, as well as the whole society\r\nof the Quakers. I thought, therefore, upon the whole, that, considering\r\nthe short time I had been at work, I was well off with respect to\r\nsupport. I believed, also, that there were still several of my own\r\nacquaintance whom I could interest in the question, and I did not doubt\r\nthat, by exerting myself diligently, persons, who were then strangers to\r\nme, would be raised up in time.\r\n\r\nI considered next, that it was impossible for a great cause like this to\r\nbe forwarded without large pecuniary funds. I questioned whether some\r\nthousand pounds would not be necessary, and from whence was such a sum\r\nto come! In answer to this, I persuaded myself that generous people\r\nwould be found who would unite with me in contributing their mite\r\ntowards the undertaking, and I seemed confident that, as the Quakers had\r\ntaken up the cause as a religious body, they would not be behind-hand in\r\nsupporting it.\r\n\r\nI considered lastly, that if I took up the question, I must devote\r\nmyself wholly to it. I was sensible that a little labour now and then\r\nwould be inadequate to the purpose, or that, where the interests of so\r\nmany thousand persons were likely to be affected, constant exertion\r\nwould be necessary. I felt certain that if ever the matter were to be\r\ntaken up, there could be no hope of success, except it should be taken\r\nup by some one who would make it an object or business of his life. I\r\nthought too that a man's life might not be more than adequate to the\r\naccomplishment of the end. But I knew of no one who could devote such a\r\nportion of time to it. Sir Charles Middleton, though he was so warm and\r\nzealous, was greatly occupied in the discharge of his office. Mr.\r\nLangton spent a great portion of his time in the education of his\r\nchildren. Dr. Baker had a great deal to do in the performance of his\r\nparochial duty. The Quakers were almost all of them in trade. I could\r\nlook therefore to no person but myself; and the question was, whether I\r\nwas prepared to make the sacrifice. In favour of the undertaking, I\r\nurged to myself, that never was any cause, which had been taken up by\r\nman in any country or in any age, so great and important; that never was\r\nthere one in which so much misery was heard to cry for redress; that\r\nnever was there one in which so much good could be done; never one in\r\nwhich the duty of Christian charity could be so extensively exercised;\r\nnever one more worthy of the devotion of a whole life towards it; and\r\nthat, if a man thought properly, he ought to rejoice to have been called\r\ninto existence, if he were only permitted to become an instrument in\r\nforwarding it in any part of its progress. Against these sentiments, on\r\nthe other hand, I had to urge, that I had been designed for the church;\r\nthat I had already advanced as far as deacon's orders in it; that my\r\nprospects there on account of my connexions were then brilliant, that,\r\nby appearing to desert my profession, my family would be dissatisfied,\r\nif not unhappy. These thoughts pressed upon me, and rendered the\r\nconflict difficult. But the sacrifice of my prospects staggered me, I\r\nown, the most. When the other objections, which I have related, occurred\r\nto me, my enthusiasm instantly, like a flash of lightning, consumed\r\nthem; but this stuck to me, and troubled me. I had ambition. I had a\r\nthirst after worldly interest and honours, and I could not extinguish it\r\nat once. I was more than two hours in solitude under this painful\r\nconflict. At length I yielded, not because I saw any reasonable prospect\r\nof success in my new undertaking (for all cool-headed and cool-hearted\r\nmen would have pronounced against it), but in obedience, I believe, to a\r\nhigher Power. And I can say, that both on the moment of this resolution,\r\nand for some time afterwards, I had more sublime and happy feelings than\r\nat any former period of my life.\r\n\r\nHaving now made up my mind on the subject, I informed Mr. Ramsay, that\r\nin a few days I should be leaving Teston, that I might begin my labours,\r\naccording to the pledge I had given him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nContinuation of the fourth Class of forerunners and coadjutors Up to\r\n1787.--Author resolves upon the distribution of his book.--Mr.\r\nSheldon; Sir Herbert Mackworth; Lord Newhaven; Lord Balgonie\r\n(afterwards Leven); Lord Hawke; Bishop Porteus.--Author visits African\r\nvessels in the Thames; and various persons, for further\r\ninformation.--Visits also Members of Parliament; Sir Richard Hill; Mr.\r\nPowys (late Lord Lilford); Mr. Wilberforce and others; conduct of the\r\nlatter on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my return to London, I called upon William Dillwyn, to inform him of\r\nthe resolution I had made at Teston, and found him at his town lodgings\r\nin the Poultry. I informed him also, that I had a letter of introduction\r\nin my pocket from Sir Charles Middleton to Samuel Hoare, with whom I was\r\nto converse on the subject. The latter gentleman had interested himself\r\nthe year before as one of the committee for the Black poor in London,\r\nwhom Mr. Sharp was sending under the auspices of government to Sierra\r\nLeone. He was also, as the reader may see by looking back, a member of\r\nthe second class of coadjutors, or of the little committee which had\r\nbranched out of the Quakers in England as before described. William\r\nDillwyn said he would go with me and introduce me himself. On our\r\narrival in Lombard-street, I saw my new friend, with whom we conversed\r\nfor some time. From thence I proceeded, accompanied by both, to the\r\nhouse of James Phillips in George-yard, to whom I was desirous of\r\ncommunicating my resolution also. We found him at home, conversing with\r\na friend of the same religious society, whose name was Joseph Gurney\r\nBevan. I then repeated my resolution before them all. We had much\r\nfriendly and satisfactory conversation together. I received much\r\nencouragement on every side, and I fixed to meet them again at the place\r\nwhere we then were in three days.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the same day, I waited upon Granville Sharp to make\r\nthe same communication to him. He received it with great pleasure, and\r\nhe hoped I should have strength to proceed. From thence I went to the\r\nBaptist-head coffee-house, in Chancery-lane, and having engaged with the\r\nmaster of the house that I should always have one private room to myself\r\nwhen I wanted it, I took up my abode there, in order to be near my\r\nfriend Richard Phillips of Lincoln's Inn, from whose advice and\r\nassistance I had formed considerable expectations.\r\n\r\nThe first matter for our deliberation, after we had thus become\r\nneighbours, was, what plan I ought to pursue to give effect to the\r\nresolution I had taken.\r\n\r\nAfter having discussed the matter two or three times at his chambers, it\r\nseemed to be our opinion, that, as members of the legislature could do\r\nmore to the purpose in this question, than any other persons, it would\r\nbe proper to circulate all the remaining copies of my work among these,\r\nin order that they might thus obtain information upon the subject.\r\nSecondly, that it would be proper that I should wait personally upon\r\nseveral of these also. And thirdly, that I should be endeavouring in the\r\ninterim to enlarge my own knowledge, that I might thus be enabled to\r\nanswer the various objections which might be advanced on the other side\r\nof the question, as well as become qualified to be a manager of the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, or at the time appointed, I went with Richard Phillips\r\nto George-yard, Lombard-street, where I met all my friends as before. I\r\ncommunicated to them the opinion we had formed at Lincoln's Inn,\r\nrelative to my future proceedings in the three different branches as now\r\ndetailed. They approved the plan. On desiring a number of my books to be\r\nsent to me at my new lodgings for the purpose of distribution, Joseph\r\nGurney Bevan, who was stated to have been present at the former\r\ninterview, seemed uneasy, and at length asked me if I was going to\r\ndistribute these at my own expense. I replied, I was. He appealed\r\nimmediately to those present whether it ought to be allowed. He asked\r\nwhether, when a young man was giving up his time from morning till\r\nnight, they who applauded his pursuit and seemed desirous of\r\nco-operating with him, should allow him to make such a sacrifice, or\r\nwhether they should not at least secure him from loss; and he proposed\r\ndirectly that the remaining part of the edition should be taken off by\r\nsubscription, and, in order that my feelings might not be hurt from any\r\nsupposed stain arising from the thought of gaining any thing by such a\r\nproposal, they should be paid for only at the prime cost. I felt myself\r\nmuch obliged to him for this tender consideration about me, and\r\nparticularly for the latter part of it, under which alone I accepted the\r\noffer. Samuel Hoare was charged with the management of the subscription,\r\nand the books were to be distributed as I had proposed, and in any way\r\nwhich I myself might prescribe.\r\n\r\nThis matter having been determined upon, my first care was that the\r\nbooks should be put into proper hands. Accordingly I went round among my\r\nfriends from day to day, wishing to secure this before I attended to any\r\nof the other objects. In this I was much assisted by my friend Richard\r\nPhillips. Mr. Langton began the distribution of them. He made a point\r\neither of writing to or of calling upon those to whom he sent them. Dr.\r\nBaker took the charge of several for the same purpose; Lord and Lady\r\nScarsdale of others; Sir Charles and Lady Middleton of others. Mr.\r\nSheldon, at the request of Richard Phillips, introduced me by letter to\r\nseveral members of parliament, to whom I wished to deliver them myself.\r\nSir Herbert Mackworth, when spoken to by the latter, offered his\r\nservices also. He seemed to be particularly interested in the cause. He\r\nwent about to many of his friends in the House of Commons, and this from\r\nday to day, to procure their favour towards it. Lord Newhaven was\r\napplied to, and distributed some. Lord Balgonie took a similar charge.\r\nThe late Lord Hawke, who told me that he had long felt for the\r\nsufferings of the injured Africans, desired to be permitted to take his\r\nshare of the distribution among members of the House of Lords, and Dr.\r\nPorteus, now Bishop of London, became another coadjutor in the same\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThis distribution of my books having been consigned to proper hands, I\r\nbegan to qualify myself, by obtaining further knowledge, for the\r\nmanagement of this great cause. As I had obtained the principal part of\r\nit from reading, I thought I ought now to see what could be seen, and to\r\nknow from living persons what could be known on the subject.  With\r\nrespect to the first of these points, the river Thames presented itself\r\nas at hand. Ships were going occasionally from the port of London to\r\nAfrica, and why could I not get on board them and examine for myself?\r\nAfter diligent inquiry, I heard of one which had just arrived. I found\r\nher to be a little wood-vessel, called the Lively, Captain Williamson,\r\nor one which traded to Africa in the natural productions of the country,\r\nsuch as ivory, bees'-wax, Malaguetta pepper, palm-oil, and dye-woods. I\r\nobtained specimens of some of these, so that I now became possessed of\r\nsome of those things of which I had only read before. On conversing with\r\nthe mate, he showed me one or two pieces of the cloth made by the\r\nnatives, and from their own cotton. I prevailed upon him to sell me a\r\npiece of each. Here new feelings arose, and particularly when I\r\nconsidered that persons of so much apparent ingenuity, and capable of\r\nsuch beautiful work as the Africans, should be made slaves, and reduced\r\nto a level with the brute creation. My reflections here on the better\r\nuse which might be made of Africa by the substitution of another trade,\r\nand on the better use which might be made of her inhabitants, served\r\ngreatly to animate and to sustain me amidst the labour of my pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe next vessel I boarded was the Fly, Captain Colley. Here I found\r\nmyself for the first time on the deck of a slave-vessel. The sight of\r\nthe rooms below and of the gratings above, and of the barricado across\r\nthe deck, and the explanation of the uses of all these, filled me both\r\nwith melancholy and horror. I found soon afterwards a fire of\r\nindignation kindling within me. I had now scarce patience to talk with\r\nthose on board. I had not the coolness this first time to go leisurely\r\nover the places that were open to me. I got away quickly. But that which\r\nI thought I saw horrible in this vessel had the same effect upon me as\r\nthat which I thought I had seen agreeable in the other, namely, to\r\nanimate and to invigorate me in my pursuit.\r\n\r\nBut I will not trouble the reader with any further account of my\r\nwater-expeditions, while attempting to perfect my knowledge on this\r\nsubject. I was equally assiduous in obtaining intelligence wherever it\r\ncould be had; and being now always on the watch, I was frequently\r\nfalling in with individuals, from whom I gained something. My object was\r\nto see all who had been in Africa, but more particularly those who had\r\nnever been interested, or who at any rate were not then interested, in\r\nthe trade. I gained accordingly access very early to General Rooke; to\r\nLieutenant Dalrymple, of the army; to Captain Fiddes, of the engineers;\r\nto the reverend Mr. Newton; to Mr. Nisbett, a surgeon in the Minories;\r\nto Mr. Devaynes, who was then in parliament, and to many others; and I\r\nmade it a rule to put down in writing, after every conversation, what\r\nhad taken place in the course of it. By these means, things began to\r\nunfold themselves to me more and more, and I found my stock of knowledge\r\nalmost daily on the increase.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, I was forwarding this, I was not inattentive to the\r\nother object of my pursuit, which was that of waiting upon members\r\npersonally. The first I called upon was Sir Richard Hill. At the first\r\ninterview he espoused the cause. I waited then upon others, and they\r\nprofessed themselves friendly; but they seemed to make this profession\r\nmore from the emotion of good hearts, revolting at the bare mention of\r\nthe Slave Trade, than from any knowledge concerning it. One, however,\r\nwhom I visited, Mr. Powys, (the late Lord Lilford,) with whom I had been\r\nbefore acquainted in Northamptonshire, seemed to doubt some of the facts\r\nin my book, from a belief that human nature was not capable of\r\nproceeding to such a pitch of wickedness. I asked him to name his facts.\r\nHe selected the case of the hundred and thirty-two slaves who were\r\nthrown alive into the sea to defraud the underwriters. I promised to\r\nsatisfy him fully upon this point, and went immediately to Granville\r\nSharp, who lent me his account of the trial, as reported at large from\r\nthe notes of the short-hand writer, whom he had employed on the\r\noccasion. Mr. Powys read the account. He became, in consequence of it,\r\nconvinced, as, indeed, he could not otherwise be, of the truth of what I\r\nhad asserted, and he declared at the same time that, if this were true,\r\nthere was nothing so horrible related of this trade, which might not\r\nimmediately be believed. Mr. Powys had been always friendly to this\r\nquestion, but now he took a part in the distribution of my books.\r\n\r\nAmong those whom I visited was Mr. Wilberforce. On my first interview\r\nwith him, he stated frankly, that the subject had often employed his\r\nthoughts, and that it was near his heart. He seemed earnest about it,\r\nand also very desirous of taking the trouble of inquiring further into\r\nit. Having read my book, which I had delivered to him, in person, he\r\nsent, for me. He expressed a wish that I would make him acquainted with\r\nsome of my authorities for the assertions in it, which I did afterwards\r\nto his satisfaction. He asked me if I could support it by any other\r\nevidence. I told him I could. I mentioned Mr. Newton, Mr. Nisbett, and\r\nseveral others to him. He took the trouble of sending for all these. He\r\nmade memorandums of their conversation, and, sending for me afterwards,\r\nshowed them to me. On learning my intention to devote myself to the\r\ncause, he paid me many handsome compliments. He then desired me to call\r\nupon him often, and to acquaint him with my progress from time to time.\r\nHe expressed also his willingness to afford me any assistance in his\r\npower in the prosecution of my pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe carrying on of these different objects, together with the writing\r\nwhich was connected with them, proved very laborious, and occupied\r\nalmost all my time. I was seldom engaged less than sixteen hours in the\r\nday. When I left Teston to begin the pursuit as an object of my life, I\r\npromised my friend Mr. Ramsay a weekly account of my progress. At the\r\nend of the first week my letter to him contained little more than a\r\nsheet of paper. At the end of the second it contained three; at the end\r\nof the third, six; and at the end of the fourth I found it would be so\r\nvoluminous, that I was obliged to decline writing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nContinuation of the fourth class of forerunners and coadjutors up to\r\n1787.--Author goes on to enlarge his knowledge in the different\r\ndepartments of the subject; communicates more frequently with Mr.\r\nWilberforce.--Meetings now appointed at the house of the\r\nlatter.--Dinner at Mr. Langton's.--Mr. Wilberforce pledges himself\r\nthere to take up the subject in Parliament; remarkable junction, in\r\nconsequence, of all the four classes of forerunners and coadjutors\r\nbefore-mentioned.--Committee formed out of these on the 22nd of May,\r\n1787, for the abolition of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Mr. Wilberforce had received me, and the pains which\r\nhe had taken, and was still taking, to satisfy himself of the truth of\r\nthose enormities which had been charged upon the Slave Trade, tended\r\nmuch to enlarge my hope, that they might become at length the subject of\r\na parliamentary inquiry. Richard Phillips, also, to whom I made a report\r\nat his chambers almost every evening of the proceedings of the day, had\r\nbegun to entertain a similar expectation. Of course we unfolded our\r\nthoughts to one another; from hence a desire naturally sprung up in each\r\nof us to inquire whether any alteration in consequence of this new\r\nprospect should be made in my pursuits. On deliberating upon this point,\r\nit seemed proper to both of us that the distribution of the books should\r\nbe continued; that I should still proceed in enlarging my own knowledge;\r\nand that I should still wait upon members of the legislature, but with\r\nthis difference, that I should never lose sight of Mr. Wilberforce, but,\r\non the other hand, that I should rather omit visiting some others than\r\npaying a proper attention to him.\r\n\r\nOne thing however appeared now to be necessary, which had not yet been\r\ndone. This was to inform our friends in the city, upon whom I had all\r\nalong occasionally called, that we believed the time was approaching\r\nwhen it would be desirable that we should unite our labours, if they saw\r\nno objection to such a measure; for, if the Slave Trade were to become a\r\nsubject of parliamentary inquiry with a view to the annihilation of it,\r\nno individual could perform the work which would be necessary for such a\r\npurpose. This work must be a work of many; and who so proper to assist\r\nin it as they, who had before so honourably laboured in it? In the case\r\nof such an event large funds also would be wanted, and who so proper to\r\nprocure and manage them as these? A meeting was accordingly called at\r\nthe house of James Phillips, when these our views were laid open. When I\r\nstated that from the very time of my hopes beginning to rise I had\r\nalways had those present in my eye as one day to be fellow-labourers,\r\nWilliam Dillwyn replied, that from the time they had first heard of the\r\n_Prize Essay_, they also had had their eyes upon me, and, from the time\r\nthey had first seen me, had conceived: a desire of making the same use\r\nof me as I had now expressed a wish of making of them, but that matters\r\ndid not appear ripe at our first interview. Our proposal, however, was\r\napproved, and an assurance was given, that an union should take place as\r\nsoon as it was judged to be seasonable. It was resolved also, that one\r\nday in the week[A] should be appointed for a meeting at the house of\r\nJames Phillips, where as many might attend as had leisure, and that I\r\nshould be there to make a report of my progress, by which we might all\r\njudge of the fitness of the time of calling ourselves an united body.\r\nPleased now with the thought that matters were put into such a train, I\r\nreturned to my former objects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: At these weekly meetings I met occasionally Joseph Woods,\r\nGeorge Harrison, and John Lloyd, three of the other members, who\r\nbelonged to the committee of the second class of forerunners and\r\ncoadjutors as before described. I had seen all of them before, but I do\r\nnot recollect the time when I first met them.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to say anything more of the first of these objects,\r\nwhich was that of the further distribution of my book, than that it was\r\ncontinued, and chiefly by the same hands.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the enlargement of my knowledge, it was promoted\r\nlikewise. I now gained access to the Custom-House in London, where I\r\npicked up much valuable information for my purpose.\r\n\r\nHaving had reason to believe that the Slave Trade was peculiarly fatal\r\nto those employed in it, I wished much to get copies of many of the\r\nmuster-rolls from the Custom-House at Liverpool for a given time. James\r\nPhillips wrote to his friend William Rathbone, who was one of his own\r\nreligious society, and who resided there, to procure them. They were\r\naccordingly sent up. The examination of these, which took place at the\r\nchambers of Richard Phillips, was long and tedious. We looked over them\r\ntogether. We usually met for this purpose at nine in the evening, and we\r\nseldom parted till one, and sometimes not till three in the morning.\r\nWhen our eyes were inflamed by the candle, or tired by fatigue, we used\r\nto relieve ourselves by walking out within the precincts of Lincoln's\r\nInn, when all seemed to be fast asleep, and thus, as it were, in\r\nsolitude and in stillness to converse upon them, as well as upon the\r\nbest means of the further promotion of our cause. These scenes of our\r\nearly friendship and exertions I shall never forget. I often think of\r\nthem both with astonishment and with pleasure. Having recruited\r\nourselves in this manner, we used to return to our work. From these\r\nmuster-rolls, I may now observe that we gained the most important\r\ninformation: we ascertained, beyond the power of contradiction, that\r\nmore than half of the seamen who went out with the ships in the Slave\r\nTrade did not return with them, and that of these so many perished, as\r\namounted to one-fifth of all employed. As to what became of the\r\nremainder, the muster-rolls did not inform us; this, therefore, was left\r\nto us as a subject for our future inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to enlarge my knowledge, my thoughts were frequently\r\nturned to the West Indian part of the question, and in this department\r\nmy friend Richard Phillips gained me important intelligence. He put into\r\nmy hands several documents concerning estates in the West Indies, which\r\nhe had mostly from the proprietors themselves, where the slaves by mild\r\nand prudent usage had so increased in population, as to supersede the\r\nnecessity of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nBy attending to these and to various other parts of the subject, I began\r\nto see as it were with new eyes; I was enabled to make several necessary\r\ndiscriminations, to reconcile things before seemingly contradictory, and\r\nto answer many objections which had hitherto put on a formidable shape.\r\nBut most of all was I rejoiced at the thought that I should soon be able\r\nto prove that which I had never doubted, but which had hitherto been\r\nbeyond my power in this case, that Providence, in ordaining laws\r\nrelative to the agency of man, had never made that to be wise which was\r\nimmoral, and that the Slave Trade would be found as impolitic as it was\r\ninhuman and unjust.\r\n\r\nIn keeping up my visits to members of parliament, I was particularly\r\nattentive to Mr. Wilberforce, whom I found daily becoming more\r\ninterested in the fate of Africa. I now made to him a regular report of\r\nmy progress, of the sentiments of those in parliament whom I had\r\nvisited, of the disposition of my friends in the city, of whom he had\r\noften heard me speak, of my discoveries from the Custom-Houses of London\r\nand Liverpool, of my documents concerning West India estates, and of\r\nall, indeed, that had occurred to me worth mentioning. He had himself\r\nalso been making his inquiries, which he communicated to me in return.\r\nOur intercourse had now become frequent, no one week elapsing without an\r\ninterview: at one of these, I suggested to him the propriety of having\r\noccasional meetings at his own house, consisting of a few friends in\r\nparliament, who might converse on the subject: of this he approved. The\r\npersons present at the first meeting were Mr. Wilberforce, the\r\nHonourable John Villiers, Mr. Powys, Sir Charles Middleton, Sir Richard\r\nHill, Mr. Granville Sharp, Mr. Ramsay, Dr. Gregory, (who had written on\r\nthe subject, as before mentioned,) and myself. At this meeting I read a\r\npaper, giving an account of the light I had collected in the course of\r\nmy inquiries, with observations as well on the impolicy as on the\r\nwickedness of the trade. Many questions arose out of the reading of this\r\nlittle essay; many answers followed. Objections were started and\r\ncanvassed. In short, this measure was found so useful, that certain\r\nother evenings as well as mornings were fixed upon for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nOn reporting my progress to my friends in the city, several of whom now\r\nassembled once in the week, as I mentioned before to have been agreed\r\nupon, and particularly on reporting the different meetings which had\r\ntaken place at the house of Mr. Wilberforce on the subject, they were of\r\nopinion that the time was approaching when we might unite, and that this\r\nunion might prudently commence as soon as ever Mr. Wilberforce would\r\ngive his word that he would take up the question in Parliament. Upon\r\nthis I desired to observe, that though the latter gentleman had pursued\r\nthe subject with much earnestness, he had never yet dropped the least\r\nhint that he would proceed so far in the matter, but I would take care\r\nthat the question should be put to him, and I would bring them his\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the promise I had now made, I went to Mr. Wilberforce.\r\nBut when I saw him, I seemed unable to inform him of the object of my\r\nvisit. Whether this inability arose from any sudden fear that his answer\r\nmight not be favourable, or from a fear that I might possibly involve\r\nhim in a long and arduous contest upon this subject, or whether it arose\r\nfrom an awful sense of the importance of the mission, as it related to\r\nthe happiness of hundreds of thousands then alive, and of millions then\r\nunborn, I cannot say. But I had a feeling within me for which I could\r\nnot account, and which seemed to hinder me from proceeding; and I\r\nactually went away without informing him of my errand.\r\n\r\nIn this situation I began to consider what to do, when I thought I would\r\ncall upon Mr. Langton, tell him what had happened, and ask his advice. I\r\nfound him at home. We consulted together. The result was, that he was to\r\ninvite Mr. Wilberforce and some others to meet me at a dinner at his own\r\nhouse in two or three days, when he said he had no doubt of being able\r\nto procure an answer, by some means or other, to the question which I\r\nwished to have resolved.\r\n\r\nOn receiving a card from Mr. Langton, I went to dine with him. I found\r\nthe party consist of Sir Charles Middleton, Mr. Wilberforce, Mr. Hawkins\r\nBrowne, Mr. Windham, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Mr. Boswell. The latter\r\nwas then known as the friend of Dr. Johnson, and afterwards as the\r\nwriter of his _Tour to the Hebrides_. After dinner the subject of the\r\nSlave Trade was purposely introduced. Many questions were put to me, and\r\nI dilated upon each in my answers, that I might inform and interest\r\nthose present as much as I could. They seemed to be greatly impressed\r\nwith my account of the loss of seamen in the trade, and with the little\r\nsamples of African cloth which I had procured for their inspection. Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds gave his unqualified approbation of the abolition of\r\nthis cruel traffic. Mr. Hawkins Browne joined heartily with him in\r\nsentiment; he spoke with much feeling upon it, and pronounced it to be\r\nbarbarous, and contrary to every principle of morality and religion. Mr.\r\nBoswell, after saying the planters would urge that the Africans were\r\nmade happier by being carried from their own country to the West Indies,\r\nobserved, \"Be it so. But we have no right to make people happy against\r\ntheir will.\" Mr. Windham, when it was suggested that the great\r\nimportance of our West Indian islands, and the grandeur of Liverpool,\r\nwould be brought against those who should propose the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade, replied, \"We have nothing to do with the policy of the\r\nmeasure. Rather let Liverpool and the islands be swallowed up in the\r\nsea, than this monstrous system of iniquity be carried on.[A]\" While\r\nsuch conversation was passing, and when all appeared to be interested in\r\nthe cause, Mr. Langton put the question, about the proposal of which I\r\nhad been so diffident, to Mr. Wilberforce, in the shape of a delicate\r\ncompliment. The latter replied, that he had no objection to bring\r\nforward the measure in parliament when he was better prepared for it,\r\nand provided no person more proper could be found. Upon this, Mr.\r\nHawkins Browne and Mr. Windham both said they would support him there.\r\nBefore I left the company, I took Mr. Wilberforce aside, and asked him\r\nif I might mention this his resolution to those of my friends in the\r\ncity, of whom he had often heard me speak, as desirous of aiding him by\r\nbecoming a committee for the purpose. He replied, I might. I then asked\r\nMr. Langton, privately, if he had any objection to belong to a society\r\nof which there might be a committee for the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade. He said he should be pleased to become a member of it. Having\r\nreceived these satisfactory answers, I returned home.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: I do not know upon what grounds, after such strong\r\nexpressions, Mr. Boswell, in the next year, and Mr. Windham, after\r\nhaving supported the cause for three or four years, became inimical to\r\nit.]\r\n\r\nThe next day, having previously taken down the substance of the\r\nconversation at the dinner, I went to James Phillips, and desired that\r\nour friends might be called together as soon as they conveniently could\r\nto hear my report. In the interim I wrote to Dr. Peckard, and waited\r\nupon Lord Scarsdale, Dr. Baker, and others, to know (supposing a society\r\nwere formed for the abolition of the Slave Trade) if I might say they\r\nwould belong to it. All of them replied in the affirmative, and desired\r\nme to represent them, if there should be any meeting for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed I met my friends. I read over the substance of the\r\nconversation which had taken place at Mr. Langton's. No difficulty\r\noccurred. All were unanimous for the formation of a committee. On the\r\nnext day we met by agreement for this purpose. It was then resolved\r\nunanimously, among other things,--That the Slave Trade was both\r\nimpolitic and unjust. It was resolved, also,--That the following persons\r\nbe a committee for procuring such information and evidence, and\r\npublishing the same, as may tend to the abolition of the Slave Trade,\r\nand for directing the application of such moneys as have been already,\r\nand may hereafter be collected for the above purpose:--\r\n\r\nAll these were present. Granville Sharp, who stands at the head of the\r\nlist, and who, as the father of the cause in England, was called to the\r\nchair, maybe considered as representing the first class of forerunners\r\nand coadjutors, as it has been before described. The five next, of whom\r\nSamuel Hoare was chosen as the treasurer, were they who had been the\r\ncommittee of the second class, or of the Quakers in England, with the\r\nexception of Dr. Knowles, who was then dying, but who, having heard of\r\nour meeting, sent a message to us to exhort us to proceed. The third\r\nclass, or that of the Quakers in America, may be considered as\r\nrepresented by William Dillwyn, by whom they were afterwards joined to\r\nus in correspondence. The two who stand next, and in which I am\r\nincluded, may be considered as representing the fourth, most of the\r\nmembers of which we had been the means of raising. Thus, on the 22nd of\r\nMay, 1787, the representatives of all the four classes, of which I have\r\nbeen giving a history from the year 1516, met together, and were united\r\nin that committee, to which I have been all along directing the\r\nattention of the reader; a committee, which, labouring afterwards with\r\nMr. Wilberforce as a parliamentary head, did, under Providence, in the\r\nspace of twenty years, contribute to put an end to a trade, which,\r\nmeasuring its magnitude by its crimes and sufferings, was the greatest\r\npractical evil that ever afflicted the human race.\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of the committee[A], notice was sent to Mr.\r\nWilberforce of the event, and a friendship began, which has continued\r\nuninterruptedly between them, from that to the present day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: All the members were of the society of the Quakers, except\r\nMr. Sharp, Sansom, and myself. Joseph Gurney Bevan was present on the\r\nday before this meeting. He desired to belong to the society, but to be\r\nexcused from belonging to the committee.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nThe preceding history of the different classes of the forerunners and\r\ncoadjutors, to the time of the formation of the committee, collected\r\ninto one view by means of a map.--Explanation of this map, and\r\nobservations upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the preceding history of the different classes of the forerunners and\r\ncoadjutors, to the time of their junction, or to the formation of the\r\ncommittee, as just explained, may be thought interesting by many, I have\r\nendeavoured, by means of the annexed map, so to bring it before the\r\nreader, that he may comprehend the whole of it at a single view.\r\n\r\nThe figure beginning at A and reaching down to X represents the first\r\nclass of forerunners and coadjutors up to the year 1787, as consisting\r\nof so many springs or rivulets, which assisted in making and swelling\r\nthe torrent which swept away the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nThe figure from B to C and from C to X represents the second class, or\r\nthat of the Quakers in England, up to the same time. The stream on the\r\nright-hand represents them as a body, and that on the left the six\r\nindividuals belonging to them, who formed the committee in 1783.\r\n\r\nThe figure from B to D represents the third class, or that of the\r\nQuakers in America when joined with others in 1774. The stream passing\r\nfrom D through E to X shows how this class was conveyed down, as it\r\nwere, so as to unite with the second. That passing from D to Y shows its\r\ncourse in its own country, to its enlargement in 1787. And here I may\r\nobserve, that as the different streams which formed a junction at X,\r\nwere instrumental in producing the abolition of the Slave Trade in\r\nEngland, in the month of March, 1807, so those, whose effects are found\r\nunited at Y, contributed to produce the same event in America, in the\r\nsame month of the same year.\r\n\r\nThe figure from F to X represents the fourth class up to 1787.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First Class of Forerunners and Coadjutors]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Second Class of Forerunners and Coadjutors]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Third Class of Forerunners and Coadjutors]\r\n\r\nX represents the junction of all the four classes in the committee\r\ninstituted in London on the twenty-second day of May, 1787.\r\n\r\nThe parallel lines G, H, I, K, represent different periods of time,\r\nshowing when the forerunners and coadjutors lived. The space between G\r\nand H includes the space of fifty years, in which we find but few\r\nlabourers in this cause. That between H and I includes the same portion\r\nof time, in which we find them considerably increased, or nearly\r\ndoubled. That between I and K represents the next thirty-seven years;\r\nbut here we find their increase beyond all expectation, for we find four\r\ntimes more labourers in this short term, than in the whole of the\r\npreceding century.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the map, as thus explained, a number of thoughts\r\nsuggested themselves, some of which it may not be improper to detail.\r\nAnd first, in looking between the first and second parallel, we\r\nperceive, that Morgan Godwyn, Richard Baxter, and George Fox, the first\r\na clergyman of the established church, the second a divine at the head\r\nof the nonconformists, and the third the founder of the religious\r\nsociety of the Quakers, appeared each of them the first in his own\r\nclass, and all of them, about the same time, in behalf of the oppressed\r\nAfricans. We see then this great truth first apparent, that the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade took its rise, not from persons who set up\r\na cry for liberty, when they were oppressors themselves, nor from\r\npersons who were led to it by ambition, or a love of reputation among\r\nmen, but where it was most desirable, namely, from the teachers of\r\nChristianity in those times.\r\n\r\nThis account of its rise will furnish us with some important lessons.\r\nAnd first, it shows us the great value of religion. We see, when moral\r\ndisorders become known, that the virtuous are they who rise up for the\r\nremoval of them. Thus Providence seems to have appointed those who\r\ndevote themselves most to his service, to the honourable office of\r\nbecoming so many agents, under his influence, for the correction of the\r\nevils of life. And as this account of the rise of the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade teaches us the necessity of a due cultivation of religion;\r\nso it should teach us to have a brotherly affection for those, who,\r\nthough they may differ from us in speculative opinions concerning it, do\r\nyet show by their conduct that they have a high reward for it. For\r\nthough Godwyn, and Baxter, and Fox, differed as to the articles of their\r\nfaith, we find them impelled by the spirit of Christianity, which is of\r\ninfinitely more importance than a mere agreement in creeds, to the same\r\ngood end.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the different streams in the map, as they are\r\ndiscoverable both in Europe and America, we are impressed with another\r\ntruth on the same subject, which is, that the Christian religion is\r\ncapable of producing the same good fruit in all lands. However men may\r\ndiffer on account of climate, or language, or government, or laws, or\r\nhowever they may be situated in different quarters of the globe, it will\r\nproduce in them the same virtuous disposition, and make them instruments\r\nfor the promotion of happiness in the world.\r\n\r\nIn looking between the two first parallels, where we see so few\r\nlabourers, and in contemplating the great increase of these between the\r\nothers, we are taught the consoling lesson, that however small the\r\nbeginning and slow the progress may appear in any good work which we may\r\nundertake, we need not be discouraged as to the ultimate result of our\r\nlabours; for though our cause may appear stationary, it may only become\r\nso, in order that it may take a deeper root, and thus be enabled to\r\nstand better against the storms which may afterwards beat about it.\r\n\r\nIn taking the same view again, we discover the manner in which light and\r\ninformation proceed under a free government in a good cause. An\r\nindividual, for example, begins; he communicates his sentiments to\r\nothers. Thus, while alive, he enlightens; when dead, he leaves his\r\nworks, behind him. Thus, though departed, he yet speaks, and his\r\ninfluence is not lost. Of those enlightened by him, some become authors,\r\nand others actors in their turn. While living, they instruct, like their\r\npredecessors; when dead, they speak also. Thus a number of dead persons\r\nare encouraging us in libraries, and a number of living are conversing\r\nand diffusing zeal among us at the same time. This, however, is not true\r\nin any free and enlightened country, with respect to the propagation of\r\nevil. The living find no permanent encouragement, and the dead speak to\r\nno purpose in such a case.\r\n\r\nThis account of the manner in which light and information proceed in a\r\nfree country, furnishes us with some valuable knowledge. It shows us,\r\nfirst, the great importance of education; for all they who can read may\r\nbecome enlightened. They may gain as much from the dead as from the\r\nliving. They may see the sentiments of former ages. Thus they may\r\ncontract, by degrees, habits of virtuous inclination, and become fitted\r\nto join with others in the removal of any of the evils of life.\r\n\r\nIt shows us, secondly, how that encouraging maxim may become true, That\r\nno good effort is ever lost. For if he, who makes the virtuous attempt,\r\nshould be prevented by death from succeeding in it, can he not speak,\r\nthough in the tomb? Will not his works still breathe his sentiments upon\r\nit? May not the opinions, and the facts, which he has recorded, meet the\r\napprobation of ten thousand readers, of whom it is probable, in the\r\ncommon course of things, that some will branch out of him as authors,\r\nand others as actors or labourers, in the same cause?\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, it will show us the difficulty (if any attempt should be\r\nmade) of reversing permanently the late noble act of the legislature for\r\nthe abolition of the Slave Trade. For let us consider how many, both of\r\nthe living and the dead, could be, made to animate us. Let us consider,\r\ntoo, that this is the cause of mercy, justice, and religion; that as\r\nsuch, it will always afford renewed means of rallying; and that the dead\r\nwill always be heard with interest, and the living with enthusiasm upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nAuthor devotes this chapter to considerations relative to himself;\r\nfears that by the frequent introduction of himself to the notice of\r\nthe reader he may incur the charge of ostentation.--Observations on\r\nsuch a charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving brought my history of the abolition of the Slave Trade up to the\r\nmonth of May 1787, I purpose taking the liberty, before I proceed with\r\nit, to devote this chapter to considerations relative to myself. This,\r\nindeed, seems to be now necessary; for I have been fearful for some\r\npages past, and, indeed, from the time when I began to introduce myself\r\nto the notice of the reader, as one of the forerunners and coadjutors in\r\nthis great cause, that I might appear to have put myself into a\r\nsituation too prominent, so as even to have incurred the charge of\r\nostentation. But if there should be some who, in consequence of what\r\nthey have already read of this history, should think thus unfavourably\r\nof me, what must their opinion ultimately be, when, unfortunately, I\r\nmust become still more prominent in it!  Nor do I know in what manner I\r\nshall escape their censure: for if, to avoid egotism, I should write, as\r\nmany have done, in the third person, what would this profit me? The\r\ndelicate situation, therefore, in which I feel myself to be placed,\r\nmakes me desirous of saying a few words to the reader on this subject.\r\n\r\nAnd first, I may observe, that several of my friends urged me from time\r\nto time, and this long before the abolition of the Slave Trade had been\r\neffected, to give a history of the rise and progress of the attempt, as\r\nfar as it had been then made; but I uniformly resisted their\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nWhen the question was decided last year, they renewed their request.\r\nThey represented to me, that no person knew the beginning and progress\r\nof this great work so well as myself; that it was a pity that such\r\nknowledge should die with me; that such a history would be useful; that\r\nit would promote good feelings among men; that it would urge them to\r\nbenevolent exertions; that it would supply them with hope in the midst\r\nof these; that it would teach them many valuable lessons;--these and\r\nother things were said to me. But, encouraging as they were, I never\r\nlost sight of the objection; which is the subject of this chapter; nor\r\ndid I ever fail to declare, that though, considering the part I had\r\ntaken in this great cause, I might be qualified better than some others,\r\nyet it was a task too delicate for me to perform. I always foresaw that\r\nI could not avoid making myself too prominent an object in such a\r\nhistory, and that I should be liable, on that account, to the suspicion\r\nof writing it for the purpose of sounding my own praise.\r\n\r\nWith this objection my friends were not satisfied. They answered, that I\r\nmight treat the History of the Abolition of the Slave Trade as a species\r\nof biography, or as the history of a part of my own life: that people,\r\nwho had much less weighty matters to communicate, wrote their own\r\nhistories; and that no one charged them with vanity for so doing.\r\n\r\nI own I was not convinced by this answer. I determined, however, in\r\ncompliance with their wishes, to examine the objection more minutely,\r\nand to see if I could overcome it more satisfactorily to my own mind.\r\nWith this view, I endeavoured to anticipate the course which such a\r\nhistory would take. I saw clearly, in the first place, that there were\r\ntimes, for months together, when the committee for the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade was labouring without me, and when I myself for an equal\r\nspace of time was labouring in distant parts of the kingdom without\r\nthem. Hence I perceived that, if my own exertions were left out, there\r\nwould be repeated chasms in this history; and, indeed, that it could not\r\nbe completed without the frequent mention of myself. And I was willing\r\nto hope that this would be so obvious to the good sense of the reader,\r\nthat if he should think me vain-glorious in the early part of it, he\r\nwould afterwards, when he advanced in the perusal of it, acquit me of\r\nsuch a charge. This consideration was the first which removed my\r\nobjection on this head. That there can be no ground for any charge of\r\nostentation, as far as the origin of this history is concerned, so I\r\nhope to convince him there, can be none, by showing him in what light I\r\nhave always viewed myself in connexion with the committee, to which I\r\nhave had the honour to belong.\r\n\r\nI have uniformly considered our committee for the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade; as we usually consider the human body, that is, as made up of a\r\nhead and of various members which had different offices to perform.\r\nThus, if one man was an eye, another was an ear, another an arm, and\r\nanother a foot. And here I may say, with great truth, that I believe no\r\ncommittee was ever made up of persons, whose varied talents were better\r\nadapted to the work before them. Viewing then the committee in this\r\nlight, and myself as in connexion with it, I may deduce those truths,\r\nwith which the analogy will furnish me. And first, it will follow, that\r\nif every member has performed his office faithfully, though one may have\r\ndone something more than another, yet no one of them in particular has\r\nany reason to boast. With what propriety could the foot, though in the\r\nexecution of its duty it had become weary, say to the finger, \"Thou hast\r\ndone less than I;\" when the finger could reply with truth, \"I have done\r\nall that has been given me to do?\". It will follow, also, that as every\r\nlimb is essentially necessary for the completion of a perfect work; so\r\nin the case before us, every one was as necessary in his own office, or\r\ndepartment, as another. For what, for example, could I myself have done\r\nif I had not derived so much assistance from the committee? What could\r\nMr. Wilberforce have done in Parliament, if I, on the other hand, had\r\nnot collected that great body of evidence, to which there was such a\r\nconstant appeal? And what could the committee have done without the\r\nparliamentary aid of Mr. Wilberforce? And in mentioning this necessity\r\nof distinct offices and talents for the accomplishment of the great\r\nwork, in which we have been all of us engaged, I feel myself bound by\r\nthe feelings of justice to deliver it as my opinion in this place, (for,\r\nperhaps, I may have no other opportunity,) that knowing, as I have done,\r\nso many members of both houses of our legislature, for many of whom I\r\nhave had a sincere respect, there was never yet one, who appeared to me\r\nto be so properly qualified, in all respects, for the management of the\r\ngreat cause of the abolition of the Slave Trade, as he, whose name I\r\nhave just mentioned. His connexions, but more particularly his\r\nacquaintance with the first minister of state, were of more service in\r\nthe promotion of it, than they, who are but little acquainted with\r\npolitical movements, can well appreciate. His habits also of diligent\r\nand persevering inquiry made him master of all the knowledge that was\r\nrequisite for conducting it. His talents both in and out of parliament\r\nmade him a powerful advocate in its favour. His character, free from the\r\nusual spots of human imperfection, gave an appropriate lustre to the\r\ncause, making it look yet more lovely, and enticing others to its\r\nsupport. But most of all the motive, on which he undertook it, insured\r\nits progress. For this did not originate in views of selfishness, or of\r\nparty or of popular applause, but in an awful sense of his duty as a\r\nChristian. It was this which gave him alacrity and courage in his\r\npursuit. It was this which made him continue in his elevated situation\r\nof a legislator, though it was unfavourable, if not to his health, at\r\nleast to his ease and comfort. It was this which made him incorporate\r\nthis great object among the pursuits of his life, so that it was daily\r\nin his thoughts. It was this which when year after year of unsuccessful\r\nexertion returned, occasioned him to be yet fresh and vigorous in\r\nspirit, and to persevere till the day of triumph.\r\n\r\nBut to return:--There is yet another consideration, which I shall offer\r\nto the reader on this subject, and with which I shall conclude it. It is\r\nthis; that no one ought to be accused of vanity until he has been found\r\nto assume to himself some extraordinary merit. This being admitted, I\r\nshall now freely disclose the views which I have always been desirous of\r\ntaking of my own conduct on this occasion, in the following words:--\r\n\r\nAs Robert Barclay, the apologist for the Quakers, when he dedicated his\r\nwork to Charles the Second, intimated to this prince, that any merit\r\nwhich the work might have, would not be derived from his patronage of\r\nit, but from the Author of all spiritual good; so I say to the reader,\r\nwith respect to myself, that I disclaim all praise on account of any\r\npart I may have taken in the promotion of this great cause, for that I\r\nam desirious above all things to attribute my best endeavours in it to\r\nthe influence of a superior Power; of Him, I mean, who gave me a heart\r\nto feel--who gave me courage to begin--and perseverance to proceed--and\r\nthat I am thankful to Him, and this with the deepest feeling of\r\ngratitude and humility, for having permitted me to become useful, in any\r\ndegree, to my fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nAuthor returns to his History.--Committee formed as before-mentioned;\r\nits proceedings.--Author produces a summary view of the Slave Trade,\r\nand of the probable consequences of its abolition.--Wrongs of Africa,\r\nby Mr. Roscoe, generously presented to the committee.--Important\r\ndiscussion as to the object of the committee.--Emancipation declared\r\nto be no part of it.--Committee decides on its public title.--Author\r\nrequested to go to Bristol, Liverpool, and Lancaster, to collect\r\nfurther information on the subject of the trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nI return now, after this long digression, to the continuation of my\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIt was shown in the latter part of the tenth chapter, that twelve\r\nindividuals, all of whom were then named, met together by means which no\r\none could have foreseen, on the 22d of May, 1787; and that, after having\r\nvoted the Slave Trade to be both unjust and impolitic, they formed\r\nthemselves into a committee for procuring such information and evidence,\r\nand for publishing the same, as might tend to the abolition of it, and\r\nfor directing the application of such money as had been already, and\r\nmight hereafter be collected for that purpose. At this meeting it was\r\nresolved also, that no less than three members should form a quorum;\r\nthat Samuel Hoare should be the treasurer; that the treasurer should pay\r\nno money but by order of the committee; and that copies of these\r\nresolutions should be printed and circulated, in which it should be\r\ninserted that the subscriptions of all such as were willing to forward\r\nthe plans of the committee should be received by the treasurer or any\r\nmember of it.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of May the committee met again to promote the object of its\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer reported at this meeting, that the subscriptions already\r\nreceived amounted to one hundred and thirty-six pounds.\r\n\r\nAs I had foreseen long before this time that my _Essay on the Slavery\r\nand Commerce of the Human Species_ was too large for general\r\ncirculation, and yet that a general circulation of knowledge on this\r\nsubject was absolutely necessary, I determined directly after the\r\nformation of the committee to write a short pamphlet consisting only of\r\neight or ten pages for this purpose. I called it _A Summary View of the\r\nSlave Trade, and of the probable consequences of its Abolition_. It\r\nbegan by exhibiting to the reader the various unjustifiable ways in\r\nwhich persons living on the coast of Africa became slaves. It then\r\nexplained the treatment which these experienced on their passage, the\r\nnumber dying in the course of it, and the treatment of the survivors in\r\nthe colonies of those nations to which they were carried. It then\r\nannounced the speedy publication of a work on the impolicy of the trade,\r\nthe contents of which, as far as I could then see, I gave generally\r\nunder the following heads:--Part the first, it was said, would show that\r\nAfrica was capable of offering to us a trade in its own natural\r\nproductions as well as in the persons of men; that the trade in the\r\npersons of men was profitable but to a few; that its value was\r\ndiminished from many commercial considerations; that it was also highly\r\ndestructive to our seamen; and that the branch of it, by which we\r\nsupplied the island of St. Domingo with slaves, was peculiarly impolitic\r\non that account. Part the second, it was said, would show that if the\r\nslaves were kindly treated in our colonies, they would increase; that\r\nthe abolition of the trade would necessarily secure such a treatment to\r\nthem, and that it would produce many other advantages which would be\r\nthen detailed.\r\n\r\nThis little piece I presented to the committee at this their second\r\nmeeting. It was then duly read and examined; and the result was, that\r\nafter some little correction it was approved, and that two thousand\r\ncopies of it were ordered to be printed, with lists of the subscribers\r\nand of the committee, and to be sent to various parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nOn June the 7th, the committee met again for the despatch of business,\r\nwhen, among other things, they voted their thanks to Dr. Baker, of Lower\r\nGrosvenor-street, who had been one of my first assistants, for his\r\nservices to the cause.\r\n\r\nAt this committee John Barton, one of the members of it, stated that he\r\nwas commissioned by the author of a poem, entitled _The Wrongs of\r\nAfrica_, to offer the profits which might arise from the sale of that\r\nwork, to the committee, for the purpose of enabling them to pursue the\r\nobject of their institution. This circumstance was not only agreeable,\r\ninasmuch as it showed us that there were others who felt with us for the\r\ninjured Africans, and who were willing to aid us in our designs, but it\r\nwas rendered still more so when we were given to understand that the\r\npoem was written by Mr. Roscoe, of Liverpool, and the preface to it by\r\nthe late Dr. Currie, who then lived in the same place. To find friends\r\nto our cause rising up from a quarter where we expected scarcely\r\nanything but opposition, was very consolatory and encouraging. As this\r\npoem was well written, but cannot now be had, I shall give the\r\nintroductory part of it, which is particularly beautiful, to the perusal\r\nof the reader. It begins thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Offspring of Love divine, Humanity!\r\n  To whom, his eldest born, th' Eternal gave\r\n  Dominion o'er the heart; and taught to touch\r\n  Its varied stops in sweetest unison;\r\n  And strike the string that from a kindred breast\r\n  Responsive vibrates! from the noisy haunts\r\n  Of mercantile confusion, where thy voice\r\n  Is heard not; from the meretricious glare\r\n  Of crowded theatres, where in thy place\r\n  Sits Sensibility, with wat'ry eye,\r\n  Dropping o'er fancied woes her useless tear;\r\n  Come thou, and weep with me substantial ills;\r\n  And execrate the wrongs that Afric's sons,\r\n  Torn from their natal shore, and doom'd to bear\r\n  The yoke of servitude in foreign climes,\r\n  Sustain. Nor vainly let our sorrows flow,\r\n  Nor let the strong emotion rise in vain;\r\n  But may the land contagion widely spread,\r\n  Till in its flame the unrelenting heart\r\n  Of avarice melt in softest sympathy--\r\n  And one bright blaze of universal love\r\n  In grateful incense rises up to Heaven!\r\n\r\n  Form'd with the same capacity of pain,\r\n  The same desire of pleasure and of ease,\r\n  Why feels not man for man! When nature shrinks\r\n  From the slight puncture of an insect's sting,\r\n  Faints, if not screen'd from sultry suns, und pines\r\n  Beneath the hardship of an hour's delay\r\n  Of needful nutriment;--when liberty\r\n  Is priz'd so dearly, that the slightest breath\r\n  That ruffles but her mantle, can awake\r\n  To arms unwarlike nations, and can rouse\r\n  Confed'rate states to vindicate her claims:--\r\n  How shall the suff'rer man his fellow doom\r\n  To ills he mourns and spurns at; tear with stripes\r\n  His quiv'ring flesh; with hunger and with thirst\r\n  Waste his emaciate frame; in ceaseless toils\r\n  Exhaust his vital powers; and bind his limbs\r\n  In galling chains? Shall he, whose fragile form\r\n  Demands continual blessings to support\r\n  Its complicated texture, air, and food,\r\n  Raiment, alternate rest, and kindly skies,\r\n  And healthful seasons, dare with impious voice\r\n  To ask those mercies, whilst his selfish aim\r\n  Arrests the general freedom of their course;\r\n  And, gratified beyond his utmost wish,\r\n  Debars another from the bounteous store?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this manner was the subject of this beautiful poem introduced to the\r\nnotice of the public. But I have no room for any further extracts, nor\r\ntime to make any further comment upon it. I can only add, that the\r\ncommittee were duly sensible as well of its merits, as of the virtuous\r\nand generous disposition of the author, and that they requested John\r\nBarton to thank him in an appropriate manner for his offer, which he was\r\nto say they accepted gratefully.\r\n\r\nAt this sitting, at which ten members were present out of the twelve, a\r\ndiscussion unexpectedly arose on a most important subject. The\r\ncommittee, finding that their meetings began to be approved by many, and\r\nthat the cause under their care was likely to spread, and foreseeing,\r\nalso, the necessity there would soon be of making themselves known as a\r\npublic body throughout the kingdom, thought it right that they should\r\nassume some title, which should be a permanent one, and which should be\r\nexpressive of their future views. This gave occasion to them to\r\nreconsider the object for which they had associated, and to fix and\r\ndefine it in such a manner that there should be no misunderstanding\r\nabout it in the public mind. In looking into the subject, it appeared to\r\nthem that there were two evils quite distinct from each other, which it\r\nmight become their duty to endeavour to remove. The first was the evil\r\nof the Slave Trade, in consequence of which many thousand persons were\r\nevery year fraudulently and forcibly taken from their country, their\r\nrelations and friends, and from all that they esteemed valuable in life.\r\nThe second was the evil of slavery itself, in consequence of which the\r\nsame persons were forced into a situation where they were deprived of\r\nthe rights of men, where they were obliged to linger out their days\r\nsubject to excessive labour and cruel punishments, and where their\r\nchildren were to inherit the same hard lot. Now the question was, which\r\nof the two evils the committee should select as that to which they\r\nshould direct their attention with a view of the removal of it; or\r\nwhether, with the same view, it should direct its attention to both of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt appeared soon to be the sense of the committee, that to aim at the\r\nremoval of both, would be to aim at too much, and that by doing this we\r\nmight lose all.\r\n\r\nThe question then was, which of the two they were to take as their\r\nobject? Now, in considering this question, it appeared that it did not\r\nmatter where they began, or which of them they took, as far as the end\r\nto be produced was the thing desired. For first, if the Slave Trade\r\nshould be really abolished, the bad usage of the slaves in the colonies,\r\nthat is, the hard part of their slavery, if not the slavery itself,\r\nwould fall. For the planters and others being unable to procure more\r\nslaves from the coast of Africa, it would follow directly, whenever this\r\ngreat event should take place, that they must treat those better whom\r\nthey might then have. They must render marriage honourable among them.\r\nThey must establish the union of one man with one wife. They must give\r\nthe pregnant women more indulgences. They must pay more attention to the\r\nrearing of their offspring. They must work and punish the adults with\r\nless rigour. Now it was to be apprehended that they could not do these\r\nthings, without seeing the political advantages which would arise to\r\nthemselves from so doing; and that, reasoning upon this, they might be\r\ninduced to go on to give them greater indulgences, rights, and\r\nprivileges, in time. But how would every such successive improvement of\r\ntheir condition operate, but to bring them nearer to the state of\r\nfreemen? In the same manner it was contended, that the better treatment\r\nof the slaves in the colonies, or that the emancipation of them there,\r\nwhen fit for it, would of itself lay the foundation for the abolition of\r\nthe Slave Trade. For if the slaves were kindly treated, that is, if\r\nmarriage were encouraged among them; if the infants who should be born\r\nwere brought up with care; if the sick were properly attended to; if the\r\nyoung and the adult were well fed and properly clothed, and not\r\nover-worked, and not worn down by the weight of severe punishments, they\r\nwould necessarily increase, and this on an extensive scale. But if the\r\nplanters were thus to get their labourers from the births on their own\r\nestates, then the Slave Trade would in time be no longer necessary to\r\nthem, and it would die away as an useless and a noxious plant. Thus it\r\nwas of no consequence, which of the two evils the committee were to\r\nselect as the object for their labours; for, as far as the end in view\r\nonly was concerned, that the same end would be produced in either case.\r\n\r\nBut in looking further into this question, it seemed to make a material\r\ndifference which of the two they selected, as far as they had in view\r\nthe due execution of any laws, which might be made respecting them, and\r\ntheir own prospect of success in the undertaking. For, by aiming at the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade, they were laying the axe at the very root.\r\nBy doing this, and this only, they would not incur the objection, that\r\nthey were meddling with the property of the planters, and letting loose\r\nan irritated race of beings, who, in consequence of all the vices and\r\ninfirmities which a state of slavery entails upon those who undergo it,\r\nwere unfit for their freedom. By asking the government of the country to\r\ndo this, and this only, they were asking for that which it had an\r\nindisputable right to do; namely, to regulate or abolish any of its\r\nbranches of commerce: whereas it was doubtful, whether it could\r\ninterfere with the management of the internal affairs of the colonies,\r\nor whether this was not wholly the province of the legislatures\r\nestablished there. By asking the government, again, to do this, and this\r\nonly, they were asking what it could really enforce. It could station\r\nits ships of war, and command its custom-houses, so as to carry any act\r\nof this kind into effect. But it could not insure that an act to be\r\nobserved in the heart of the islands should be enforced[A]. To this it\r\nwas added, that if the committee were to fix upon the annihilation of\r\nslavery as the object for their labours, the Slave Trade would not fall\r\nso speedily as it would by a positive law for the abolition; because,\r\nthough the increase from the births might soon supply all the estates\r\nnow in cultivation with labourers, yet new plantations might be opened\r\nfrom time to time in different islands, so that no period could be fixed\r\nupon, when it could be said that it would cease.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The late correspondence of the governors of our colonies\r\nwith Lord Camden in his official situation, but particularly the\r\nstatements made by Lord Seaforth and General Prevost, have shown the\r\nwisdom of this remark, and that no dependence was to be had for the\r\nbetter usage of the slaves but upon the total abolition of the trade.]\r\n\r\nImpressed by these arguments, the committee were clearly of opinion,\r\nthat they should define their object to be the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade, and not of the slavery which sprung from it. Hence from this\r\ntime, and in allusion to the month when this discussion took place, they\r\nstyled themselves in their different advertisements, and reports, though\r\nthey were first associated in the month of May, The Committee instituted\r\nin June, 1787, for effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. Thus, at\r\nthe very outset, they took a ground which was for ever tenable. Thus\r\nthey were enabled also to answer the objection, which was afterwards so\r\nconstantly and so industriously circulated against them, that they were\r\ngoing to emancipate the slaves. And I have no doubt that this wise\r\ndecision contributed greatly to their success; for I am persuaded that,\r\nif they had adopted the other object, they could not for years to come,\r\nif ever, have succeeded in their attempt.\r\n\r\nBefore the committee broke up, I represented to them the necessity there\r\nwas of obtaining further knowledge on all those individual points which\r\nmight be said to belong to the great subject of the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade. In the first place, this knowledge was necessary for me, if\r\nI were to complete my work on _The Impolicy of this Trade_, which work,\r\nthe _Summary View_, just printed, had announced to the world. It would\r\nbe necessary, also, in case the Slave Trade should become a subject of\r\nparliamentary inquiry; for this inquiry could not proceed without\r\nevidence. And if any time was peculiarly fit for the procuring of such\r\ninformation or evidence, it was the present. At this time the passions\r\nof men had not been heated by any public agitation of the question, nor\r\nhad interest felt itself biassed to conceal the truth. But as soon as\r\never it should be publicly understood, that a parliamentary inquiry was\r\ncertain, (which we ourselves believed would be the case, but which\r\ninterested men did not then know,) we should find many of the avenues to\r\ninformation closed against us. I proposed, therefore, that some one of\r\nthe committee should undertake a journey to Bristol, Liverpool, and\r\nLancaster, where he should reside for a time to collect further light\r\nupon this subject; and that if others should feel their occupations or\r\nengagements to be such as would make such a journey unsuitable, I would\r\nundertake it myself. I begged, therefore, the favour of the different\r\nmembers of the committee, to turn the matter over in their minds by the\r\nnext meeting, that we might then talk over and decide upon the propriety\r\nof the measure.\r\n\r\nThe committee held its fourth meeting on the 12th of June. Among the\r\nsubjects which were then brought forward, was that of the journey before\r\nmentioned. The propriety, and indeed, even the necessity, of it was so\r\napparent, that I was requested by all present to undertake it, and a\r\nminute for that purpose was entered upon our records. Of this journey,\r\nas gradually unfolding light on the subject, and as peculiarly connected\r\nwith the promotion of our object, I shall now give an account; after\r\nwhich I shall return to the proceedings of the committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nAuthor arrives at Bristol; introduction to Quaker families\r\nthere.--Objects of his inquiry.--Ill usage of seamen on board the ship\r\nBrothers.--Obtains a knowledge of several articles of African\r\nproduce.--Dr. Caniplin; Dean Tucker; Mr. Henry Sulgar.--Procures an\r\nauthenticated account of the treacherous massacre at Calabar.--Ill\r\nusage of the seamen of the ship Alfred.--Painful feelings of the\r\nauthor on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving made preparations for my journey, I took my leave of the\r\ndifferent individuals of the committee. I called upon Mr. Wilberforce,\r\nalso, with the same design. He was then very ill, and in bed; Sir\r\nRichard Hill and others were sitting by his bedside. After conversing as\r\nmuch as he well could in his weak state, he held out his hand to me and\r\nwished me success. When I left him I felt much dejected; it appeared to\r\nme as if it would be in this case, as it is often in that of other\r\nearthly things, that we scarcely possess what we repute a treasure when\r\nit is taken from us.\r\n\r\nI determined to take this journey on horseback, not only on account of\r\nthe relaxed state in which I found myself, after such close and constant\r\napplication, but because I wished to have all my time to myself upon the\r\nroad, in order the better to reflect upon the proper means of promoting\r\nthis great cause. The first place I resolved to visit was Bristol;\r\naccordingly I directed my course thither. On turning a corner, within\r\nabout a mile of that city, at about eight in the evening, I came within\r\nsight of it. The weather was rather hazy, which occasioned it to look of\r\nunusual dimensions. The bells of some of the churches were then ringing;\r\nthe sound of them did not strike me till I had turned the corner before\r\nmentioned, when it came upon me at once; it filled me, almost directly,\r\nwith a melancholy for which I could not account. I began now to tremble,\r\nfor the first time, at the arduous task I had undertaken, of attempting\r\nto subvert one of the branches of the commerce of the great place which\r\nwas then before me. I began to think of the host of people I should have\r\nto encounter in it; I anticipated much persecution in it also; and I\r\nquestioned whether I should even get out of it alive. But in journeying\r\non I became more calm and composed; my spirits began to return. In these\r\nlatter moments I considered my first feelings as useful, inasmuch as\r\nthey impressed upon me the necessity of extraordinary courage, and\r\nactivity, and perseverance, and of watchfulness, also, over my own\r\nconduct, that I might not throw any stain upon the cause I had\r\nundertaken. When, therefore, I entered the city, I entered it with an\r\nundaunted spirit, determining that no labour should make me shrink, nor\r\ndanger, nor even persecution, deter me from my pursuit.\r\n\r\nMy first introduction was by means of a letter to Harry Gandy, who had\r\nthen become one of the religious society of the Quakers. This\r\nintroduction to him was particularly useful to me; for he had been a\r\nseafaring man. In his early youth he had been of a roving disposition;\r\nand, in order to see the world, had been two voyages in the Slave Trade,\r\nso that he had known the nature and practices of it. This enabled him to\r\ngive me much useful information on the subject; and as he had frequently\r\nfelt, as he grew up, deep affliction of mind for having been concerned\r\nin it, he was impelled to forward my views as much as possible, under an\r\nidea that he should be thus making some reparation for the indiscreet\r\nand profane occupations of his youth.\r\n\r\nI was also introduced to the families of James Harford, John Lury,\r\nMatthew Wright, Philip, Debell Tucket, Thomas Bonville, and John Waring;\r\nall of whom were of the same religious society. I gained an\r\nintroduction, also, soon afterwards, to George Fisher. These were my\r\nfirst and only acquaintance at Bristol for some time; I derived\r\nassistance in the promotion of my object from all of them; and it is a\r\nmatter of pleasing reflection, that the friendships then formed have\r\nbeen kept alive to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe objects I had marked down as those to be attended to, were--to\r\nascertain what were the natural productions of Africa, and, if possible,\r\nto obtain specimens of them, with the view of forming a cabinet or\r\ncollection--to procure as much information as I could relative to the\r\nmanner of obtaining slaves on continent of Africa, of transporting them\r\nto the West Indies, and of treating them there--to prevail upon persons,\r\nhaving a knowledge of any or all of these circumstances, to come forward\r\nto be examined as evidences before parliament, if such an examination\r\nshould take place--to make myself still better acquainted with the loss\r\nof seamen in the Slave Trade--also with the loss of those who were\r\nemployed in the other trades from the same port--to know the nature, and\r\nquantity, and value of the imports and exports of goods in the former\r\ncase:--there were some other objects which I classed under the head of\r\nmiscellaneous.\r\n\r\nIn my first movements about this city, I found that people talked very\r\nopenly on the subject of the Slave Trade. They seemed to be well\r\nacquainted with the various circumstances belonging to it. There were\r\nfacts, in short, in every body's mouth concerning it; and every body\r\nseemed to execrate it, though no one thought of its abolition. In this\r\nstate of things I perceived that my course was obvious; for I had little\r\nelse to do, in pursuing two or three of my objects, than to trace the\r\nfoundation of those reports which were in circulation.\r\n\r\nOn the third of July I heard that the ship Brothers[A], then lying in\r\nKing's Road for Africa, could not get her seamen, and that a party which\r\nhad been put on board, becoming terrified by the prospect of their\r\nsituation, had left her on Sunday morning. On inquiring further, I found\r\nthat those who had navigated her on her last voyage, thirty-two of whom\r\nhad died, had been so dreadfully used by the captain, that he could not\r\nget hands in the present. It was added, that the treatment of seamen was\r\na crying evil in this trade, and that consequently few would enter into\r\nit, so that there was at all times a great difficulty in procuring them,\r\nthough they were ready enough to enter into other trades.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: I abstain from mentioning the names of the captain of this\r\nor of other vessels, lest the recording of them should give pain to\r\nrelatives who can have had no share in their guilt.]\r\n\r\nThe relation of these circumstances made me acquainted with two things,\r\nof which I had not before heard; namely, the aversion of seamen to\r\nengage, and the bad usage of them when engaged in this cruel trade; into\r\nboth which I determined immediately to inquire.\r\n\r\nI conceived that it became me to be very cautious about giving ear too\r\nreadily to reports; and therefore, as I could easily learn the truth of\r\none of the assertions which had been made to me, I thought it prudent to\r\nascertain this, and to judge, by the discovery I should make concerning\r\nit, what degree of credit might be due to the rest. Accordingly, by\r\nmeans of my late friend, Truman Harford, the eldest son of the\r\nrespectable family of that name, to which I have already mentioned\r\nmyself to have been introduced, I gained access to the muster-roll of\r\nthe ship Brothers. On looking over the names of her last crew, I found\r\nthe melancholy truth confirmed, that thirty-two of them had been placed\r\namong the dead.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained this circumstance, I became eager to inquire into the\r\ntruth of the others, but more particularly of the treatment of one of\r\nthe seamen, which, as it was reported to me, exceeded all belief. His\r\nname was John Dean; he was a black man, but free. The report was, that\r\nfor a trifling circumstance, for which he was in no-wise to blame, the\r\ncaptain had fastened him with his belly to the deck, and that, in this\r\nsituation, he had poured hot pitch upon his back, and made incisions in\r\nit with hot tongs.\r\n\r\nBefore however I attempted to learn the truth of this barbarous\r\nproceeding, I thought I would look into the ship's muster-roll, to see\r\nif I could find the name of such a man. On examination I found it to be\r\nthe last on the list. John Dean, it appeared, had been one of the\r\noriginal crew, having gone on board, from Bristol, on the twenty-second\r\nday of July, 1785.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring where Dean was to be found, my informant told me that he\r\nhad lately left Bristol for London. I was shown, however, to the house\r\nwhere he had lodged. The name of his landlord was Donovan. On talking\r\nwith him on the subject, he assured me that the report I had heard was\r\ntrue; for that while he resided with him he had heard an account of his\r\nusage from some of his ship-mates, and that he had often looked at his\r\nscarred and mutilated back.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring of Donovan if any other person in Bristol could corroborate\r\nthis account, he referred me to a reputable tradesman living, in the\r\nMarket-place. Having been introduced to him, he told me that he had long\r\nknown John Dean to be a sober and industrious man; that he had seen the\r\nterrible indentures on his back; and that they were said to have been\r\nmade by the captain, in the manner related, during his last voyage.\r\n\r\nWhile I was investigating this matter further, I was introduced to Mr.\r\nSydenham Teast, a respectable ship-builder in Bristol, and the owner of\r\nvessels trading to Africa in the natural productions of that country. I\r\nmentioned to him by accident what I had heard relative to the treatment\r\nof John Dean. He said it was true. An attorney[A] in London had then\r\ntaken up his cause, in consequence of which the captain had been\r\nprevented from sailing till he could find persons who would be\r\nanswerable for the damages which might be awarded against him in a court\r\nof law. Mr. Teast further said, that, not knowing at that time the\r\ncruelty of the transaction to its full extent, he himself had been one\r\nof the securities for the captain at the request of the purser[B] of the\r\nship. Finding, however, afterwards, that it was as the public had\r\nstated, he was sorry that he had ever interfered, in such a barbarous\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: I afterwards found out this attorney. He described the\r\ntransaction to me, as, by report, it had taken place, and informed me\r\nthat he had made the captain of the Brothers pay for his barbarity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: The purser of a ship, at Bristol, is the person who manages\r\nthe outfit, as well as the trade, and who is often in part owner of\r\nher.]\r\n\r\nThis transaction, which I now believed to be true, had the effect of\r\npreparing me for crediting whatever I might hear concerning the\r\nbarbarities said to be practised in this trade. It kindled also a fire\r\nof indignation within me, and produced in me both anxiety and spirit, to\r\nproceed. But that which excited these feelings the most, was the\r\nconsideration that the purser of this ship, knowing, as he did, of this\r\nact of cruelty, should have sent out this monster again. This, I own,\r\nmade me think that there was a system of bad usage to be deliberately\r\npractised upon the seamen in this employment, for some purpose or other\r\nwhich I could then neither comprehend nor ascertain.\r\n\r\nBut while I was in pursuit of this one object, I was not unmindful of\r\nthe others which I had marked out for myself. I had already procured an\r\ninterview, as I have mentioned, with Mr. Sydenham Teast. I had done this\r\nwith a view of learning from him what were the different productions of\r\nthe continent of Africa, as far as he had been able to ascertain from\r\nthe imports by his own vessels. He was very open and communicative. He\r\nhad imported ivory, red-wood, cam-wood, and gum-copal. He purposed to\r\nimport palm-oil. He observed that bees'-wax might be collected, also,\r\nupon the coast. Of his gum-copal he gave me a specimen. He furnished me,\r\nalso, with two different specimens of unknown woods, which had the\r\nappearance of being useful. One of his captains, he informed me, had\r\nbeen told by the natives, that cotton, pink in the pod, grew in their\r\ncountry. He was of opinion, that many valuable productions might be\r\nfound upon this continent.\r\n\r\nMr. Biggs, to whom I gained an introduction also, was in a similar trade\r\nwith Mr. Teast; that is, he had one or two vessels which skimmed, as it\r\nwere, the coast and rivers for what they could get of the produce of\r\nAfrica, without having any concern in the trade for slaves. Mr. Biggs\r\ngave me a specimen of gum Senegal, of yellow-wood, and of Malaguetta and\r\nCayenne pepper. He gave me, also, small pieces of cloth made and dyed by\r\nthe natives, the colours of which they could only have obtained from\r\nmaterials in their own country. Mr. Biggs seemed to be assured that, if\r\nproper persons were sent to Africa on discovery, they would fine a rich\r\nmine of wealth in the natural productions of it, and in none more\r\nadvantageous to this as a manufacturing nation, than in the many\r\nbeautiful dyes which it might furnish.\r\n\r\nFrom Thomas Bonville I collected two specimens of cloth made by the\r\nnatives; and from others a beautiful piece of tulipwood, a small piece\r\nof wood similar to mahogany, and a sample of fine rice, all of which had\r\nbeen brought from the same continent.\r\n\r\nAmong the persons whom I found out at Bristol, and from whom I derived\r\nassistance, were Dr. Camplin and the celebrated Dean Tucker. The former\r\nwas my warm defender; for the West Indian and African merchants, as soon\r\nas they discovered my errand, began to calumniate me. The dean, though\r\nin a very advanced age, felt himself much interested in my pursuit. He\r\nhad long moved in the political world himself, and was desirous of\r\nhearing of what was going forward that was new in it, but particularly\r\nabout so desirable a measure as that of the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade[A]. He introduced me to the Custom House at Bristol. He used to\r\ncall upon me at the Merchants' Hall, while I was transcribing the\r\nmuster-rolls of the seamen there. In short, he seemed to be interested\r\nin all my movements. He became, also, a warm supporter both of me and of\r\nmy cause.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Dean Tucker, in his _Reflections on the Disputes between\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland_, published in 1785, had passed a severe\r\ncensure on the British planters for the inhuman treatment of their\r\nslaves.]\r\n\r\nAmong others who were useful to me in my pursuit, was Mr. Henry Sulgar,\r\nan amiable minister of the gospel, belonging to the religious society of\r\nthe Moravians in the same city. From him I first procured authentic\r\ndocuments relative to the treacherous massacre at Calabar. This cruel\r\ntransaction had been frequently mentioned to me; but as it had taken\r\nplace twenty years before, I could not find one person who had been\r\nengaged in it, nor could I come, in a satisfactory manner, at the\r\nvarious particulars belonging to it. My friend, however, put me in\r\npossession of copies of the real depositions which had been taken in the\r\ncase of the king against Lippincott and others relative to this event;\r\nnamely, of Captain Floyd, of the city of Bristol, who had been a witness\r\nto the scene, and of Ephraim Robin John, and of Ancona Robin Robin John,\r\ntwo African chiefs, who had been sufferers by it. These depositions had\r\nbeen taken before Jacob Kirby and Thomas Symons, esquires, commissioners\r\nat Bristol for taking affidavits in the Court of King's Bench. The\r\ntragedy, of which they gave a circumstantial account, I shall present to\r\nthe reader in as concise a manner as I can.\r\n\r\nIn the year, 1767, the ships Indian Queen, Duke of York, Nancy, and\r\nConcord, of Bristol; the Edgar, of Liverpool; and the Canterbury, of\r\nLondon; lay in Old Calabar river.\r\n\r\nIt happened, at this time, that a quarrel subsisted between the\r\nprincipal inhabitants of Old Town and those of New Town, Old Calabar,\r\nwhich had originated in a jealousy respecting slaves. The captains of\r\nthe vessels now mentioned, joined in sending several letters to the\r\ninhabitants of Old Town, but particularly to Ephraim Robin John, who was\r\nat that time a grandee, or principal inhabitant of the place. The tenor\r\nof these letters was, that they were sorry that any jealousy or quarrel\r\nshould subsist between the two parties; that if the inhabitants of Old\r\nTown would come on board, they would afford them security and\r\nprotection; adding, at the same time, that their intention in inviting\r\nthem was, that they might become mediators, and thus heal their\r\ndisputes.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Old Town, happy to find that their differences were\r\nlikely to be accommodated, joyfully accepted the invitation. The three\r\nbrothers of the grandee just mentioned, the eldest of whom was Amboe\r\nRobin John, first entered their canoe, attended by twenty-seven others,\r\nand, being followed by nine canoes, directed their course to the Indian\r\nQueen. They were despatched from thence the next morning to the Edgar,\r\nand afterwards to the Duke of York, on board of which they went, leaving\r\ntheir canoe and attendants by the side of the same vessel. In the mean\r\ntime, the people on board the other canoes were either distributed on\r\nboard, or lying close to, the other ships.\r\n\r\nThis being the situation of the three brothers, and of the principal\r\ninhabitants of the place, the treachery now began to appear. The crew of\r\nthe Duke of York, aided by the captain and mates, and armed with pistols\r\nand cutlasses, rushed into the cabin, with an intent to seize the\r\npersons of their three innocent and unsuspicious guests. The unhappy\r\nmen, alarmed at this violation of the rights of hospitality, and struck\r\nwith astonishment at the behaviour of their supposed friends, attempted\r\nto escape through the cabin windows; but, being wounded, were obliged to\r\ndesist, and to submit to be put in irons.\r\n\r\nIn the same moment in which this atrocious attempt had been made, an\r\norder had been given to fire upon the canoe, which was then lying by the\r\nside of the Duke of York. The canoe soon filled and sunk, and the\r\nwretched attendants were either seized, killed, or drowned. Most of the\r\nother ships followed the example. Great numbers were additionally killed\r\nand drowned on the occasion, and others were swimming to the shore.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, the inhabitants of New Town, who had concealed\r\nthemselves in the bushes by the water-side, and between whom and the\r\ncommanders of the vessels the plan had been previously concerted, came\r\nout from their hiding-places, and, embarking in their canoes, made for\r\nsuch as were swimming from the fire of the ships. The ships' boats,\r\nalso, were manned, and joined in the pursuit. They butchered the\r\ngreatest part of those whom they caught. Many dead bodies were soon seen\r\nupon the sands, and others were floating upon the water; and including\r\nthose who were seized and carried off, and those who were drowned and\r\nkilled, either by the firing of the ships or by the people of New Town,\r\nthree hundred were lost to the inhabitants of Old Town on that day.\r\n\r\nThe carnage which I have been now describing was scarcely over, when a\r\ncanoe, full of the principal people of New Town, who had been the\r\npromoters of the scheme, dropped along-side of the Duke of York. They\r\ndemanded the person of Amboe Robin John, the brother of the grandee of\r\nOld Town, and the eldest of the three on board. The unfortunate man put\r\nthe palms of his hands together, and beseeched the commander of the\r\nvessel that he would not violate the rights of hospitality, by giving up\r\nan unoffending stranger to his enemies. But no entreaties could avail.\r\nThe commander received from the New Town people a slave of the name of\r\nEcong in his stead, and then forced him into the canoe, where his head\r\nwas immediately struck off in the sight of the crew, and of his\r\nafflicted and disconsolate brothers. As for them, they escaped his fate;\r\nbut they were carried off with their attendants to the West Indies, and\r\nsold for slaves.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of this tragical event now fully confirmed me in the\r\nsentiment, that the hearts of those who were concerned in this traffic\r\nbecame unusually hardened, and that I might readily believe any\r\natrocities, however great, which might be related of them. It made also\r\nmy blood boil, as it were, within me: it gave anew spring to my\r\nexertions; and I rejoiced, sorrowful as I otherwise was, that I had\r\nvisited Bristol, if it had been only to gain an accurate statement of\r\nthis one fact.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing my objects, I found that reports were current, that the crew\r\nof the Alfred slave-vessel, which had just returned, had been\r\nbarbarously used, but particularly a young man of the name of Thomas,\r\nwho had served as the surgeon's mate on board her. The report was, that\r\nhe had been repeatedly knocked down by the captain; that he had become\r\nin consequence of his ill usage so weary of his life, that he had three\r\ntimes jumped over board to destroy it; that on being taken up the last\r\ntime he had been chained to the deck of the ship, in which situation he\r\nhad remained night and day for some time; that in consequence of this\r\nhis health had been greatly impaired; and that it was supposed he could\r\nnot long survive this treatment.\r\n\r\nIt was with great difficulty, notwithstanding all my inquiries, that I\r\ncould trace this person. I discovered him, however, at last. He was\r\nconfined to his bed when I saw him, and appeared to me to be delirious.\r\nI could collect nothing from himself relative to the particulars of his\r\ntreatment. In his intervals of sense, he exclaimed against the cruelty\r\nboth of the captain and of the chief mate, and pointing to his legs,\r\nthighs, and body, which were all wrapped up in flannel, he endeavoured\r\nto convince me how much he had suffered there. At one time he said he\r\nforgave them. At another, he asked if I came to befriend him. At\r\nanother, he looked wildly, and asked if I meant to take the captain's\r\npart, and to kill him.\r\n\r\nI was greatly affected by the situation of this poor man, whose image\r\nhaunted me both night and day, and I was meditating how most effectually\r\nto assist him, when I heard that he was dead.\r\n\r\nI was very desirous of tracing something further on this subject, when\r\nWalter Chandler, of the society of the Quakers, who had been daily\r\nlooking out for intelligence for me, brought a young man to me of the\r\nname of Dixon. He had been one of the crew of the same ship. He told me\r\nthe particulars of the treatment of Thomas, with very little variation\r\nfrom those contained in the public report. After cross-examining him in\r\nthe best manner I was able, I could find no inconsistency in his\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nI asked Dixon how the captain came to treat the surgeon's mate in\r\nparticular so ill. He said he had treated them all much alike. A person\r\nof the name of Bulpin, he believed, was the only one who had escaped bad\r\nusage in the ship. With respect to himself, he had been cruelly used so\r\nearly as in the outward bound passage, which had occasioned him to jump\r\noverboard. When taken up, he was put into irons, and kept in these for a\r\nconsiderable time. He was afterwards ill used at different times, and\r\neven so late as within three or four days of his return to port. For\r\njust before the Alfred made the island of Lundy, he was struck by the\r\ncaptain, who cut his under lip into two. He said that it had bled so\r\nmuch, that the captain expressed himself as if much alarmed; and having\r\nthe expectation of arriving soon at Bristol, he had promised to make him\r\namends, if he would hold his peace. This he said he had hitherto done,\r\nbut he had received no recompense. In confirmation of his own usage, he\r\ndesired me to examine his lip, which I had no occasion to do, having\r\nalready perceived it, for the wound was apparently almost fresh.\r\n\r\nI asked Dixon if there was any person in Bristol beside himself, who\r\ncould confirm to me this his own treatment, as well as that of the other\r\nunfortunate man who was now dead. He referred me to a seaman of the name\r\nof Matthew Pyke. This person, when brought to me, not only related\r\nreadily the particulars of the usage in both cases, as I have now stated\r\nthem, but that which he received himself. He said that his own arm had\r\nbeen broken by the chief mate in Black River, Jamaica, and that he had\r\nalso by the captain's orders, though contrary to the practice in\r\nmerchant-vessels, been severely flogged. His arm appeared to be then in\r\npain; and I had a proof of the punishment by an inspection of his back.\r\n\r\nI asked Matthew Pyke if the crew in general had been treated in a cruel\r\nmanner. He replied they had, except James Bulpin. I then asked where\r\nJames Bulpin was to be found. He told me where he had lodged; but feared\r\nhe had gone home to his friends in Somersetshire, I think, somewhere in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Bridgewater.\r\n\r\nI thought it prudent to institute an inquiry into the characters of\r\nThomas, Dixon, and Matthew Pyke, before I went further. The two former I\r\nfound were strangers in Bristol, and I could collect nothing about them.\r\nThe latter was a native of the place, had served his time as a seaman\r\nfrom the port, and was reputed of fair character.\r\n\r\nMy next business was to see James Bulpin. I found him just setting off\r\nfor the country. He stopped, however, to converse with me. He was a\r\nyoung man of very respectable appearance, and of mild manners. His\r\nappearance, indeed, gave me reason to hope that I might depend upon his\r\nstatements; but I was most of all influenced by the consideration that,\r\nnever having been ill-used himself, he could have no inducement to go\r\nbeyond the bounds of truth on this occasion. He gave me a melancholy\r\nconfirmation of all the three cases. He told me, also, that one Joseph\r\nCunningham had been a severe sufferer, and that there was reason to fear\r\nthat Charles Horseler, another of the crew, had been so severely beaten\r\nover the breast with a knotted end of a rope, (which end was of the size\r\nof a large ball, and had been made on purpose,) that he died of it. To\r\nthis he added, that it was now a notorious fact, that the captain of the\r\nAlfred, when mate of a slave-ship, had been tried at Barbados for the\r\nmurder of one of the crew with whom he had sailed, but that he escaped\r\nby bribing the principal witness to disappear[A].\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Mr. Sampson, who was surgeon's mate of the ship in which\r\nthe captain had thus served as a mate, confirmed to me afterwards this\r\nassertion, having often heard him boast in the cabin, \"how he had\r\ntricked the law on that occasion.\"]\r\n\r\nThe reader will see, the further I went into the history of this voyage,\r\nthe more dismal it became. One miserable account, when examined, only\r\nbrought up another. I saw no end to inquiry. The great question was,\r\nwhat was I to do? I thought the best thing would be to get the captain\r\napprehended, and make him stand his trial either for the murder of\r\nThomas or of Charles Horseler. I communicated with the late Mr. Burges,\r\nan eminent attorney, and the deputy town-clerk, on this occasion. He had\r\nshown an attachment to me on account of the cause I had undertaken, and\r\nhad given me privately assistance in it. I say privately; because,\r\nknowing the sentiments of many of the corporate body at Bristol, under\r\nwhom he acted, he was fearful of coming forward in an open manner. His\r\nadvice to me was, to take notes of the case for my own private\r\nconviction, but to take no public cognizance of it. He said that seamen,\r\nas soon as their wages were expended, must be off to sea again. They\r\ncould not generally, as landsmen do, maintain themselves on shore. Hence\r\nI should be obliged to keep the whole crew at my own expense till the\r\nday of trial, which might not be for months to come. He doubted not\r\nthat, in the interim, the merchants and others would inveigle many of\r\nthem away by making them boatswains and other inferior officers in some\r\nof their ships; so that, when the day of trial should come, I should\r\nfind my witnesses dispersed and gone. He observed, moreover, that if any\r\nof the officers of the ship had any notion of going out again under the\r\nsame owners[A], I should have all these against me. To which he added,\r\nthat if I were to make a point of taking up the cause of those whom I\r\nfound complaining of hard usage in this trade, I must take up that of\r\nnearly all who sailed in it; for that he only knew of one captain from\r\nthe port in the Slave Trade, who did not deserve long ago to be hanged.\r\nHence I should get into a labyrinth of expense, and difficulty, and\r\nuneasiness of mind, from whence I should not easily find a clew to guide\r\nme.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The seamen of the Alfred informed the purser of their ill\r\nusage, Matthew Pyke not only showed him his arm and his back, but\r\nacquainted him with the murder of Charles Horseler, stating that he had\r\nthe instrument of his death in his possession. The purser seemed more\r\nalive to this than to any other circumstance, and wished to get it from\r\nhim. Pyke, however, had given it to me. Now what will the reader think,\r\nwhen he is informed that the purser, after all this knowledge of the\r\ncaptain's cruelty, sent him out again, and that he was the same person\r\nwho was purser of the Brothers, and who had also sent out the captain of\r\nthat ship a second time, as has been related, notwithstanding his\r\nbarbarities in former voyages!]\r\n\r\nThis advice, though it was judicious, and founded on a knowledge of law\r\nproceedings, I found it very difficult to adopt. My own disposition was\r\nnaturally such, that whatever I engaged in I followed with more than\r\nordinary warmth. I could not be supposed, therefore, affected and\r\ninterested as I then was, to be cool and tranquil on this occasion. And\r\nyet what would my worthy friend have said, if in this first instance I\r\nhad opposed him? I had a very severe struggle in my own feelings on this\r\naccount. At length, though reluctantly, I obeyed; but as the passions\r\nwhich agitate the human mind, when it is greatly inflamed, must have a\r\nvent somewhere, or must work off, as it were, or in working together\r\nmust produce some new passion or effect, so I found the rage which had\r\nbeen kindling within me subsiding into the most determined resolutions\r\nof future increased activity and perseverance. I began now to think that\r\nthe day was not long enough for me to labour in. I regretted often the\r\napproach of night, which suspended my work, and I often welcomed that of\r\nthe morning, which restored me to it. When I felt myself weary, I became\r\nrefreshed by the thought of what I was doing; when disconsolate, I was\r\ncomforted by it. I lived in hope that every day's labour would furnish\r\nme with that knowledge which would bring this evil nearer to its end;\r\nand I worked on under these feelings, regarding neither trouble nor\r\ndanger in the pursuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nAuthor confers with the inhabitants of Bridgewater relative to a\r\npetition to parliament in behalf of the abolition; returns to Bristol;\r\ndiscovers a scandalous mode of procuring seamen for the Slave Trade,\r\nand of paying them; makes a comparative view of their loss in this and\r\nin other trades; procures imports and exports.--Examines the\r\nconstruction and admeasurement of slave ships; of the Fly and\r\nNeptune.--Difficulty of procuring evidence.--Case of Gardiner, of the\r\nPilgrim; of Arnold, of the Ruby; some particulars of the latter in his\r\nformer voyages.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving heard by accident that the inhabitants of the town of Bridgewater\r\nhad sent a petition to the House of Commons, in the year 1785, for the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade, as has been related in a former part of\r\nthe work, I determined, while my feelings were warm, to go there, and to\r\ntry to find out those who had been concerned in it, and to confer with\r\nthem as the tried friends of the cause. The time seemed to me to be\r\napproaching when the public voice should be raised against this enormous\r\nevil. I was sure that it was only necessary for the inhabitants of this\r\nfavoured island to know it to feel a just indignation against it.\r\nAccordingly I set off. My friend George Fisher, who was before mentioned\r\nto have been of the religious Society of the Quakers, gave me an\r\nintroduction to the respectable family of Ball, which was of the same\r\nreligious persuasion. I called upon Mr. Sealey, Anstice, Crandon, Chubb,\r\nand others. I laid open to those whom I saw, the discoveries I had made\r\nrelative to the loss and ill treatment of seamen; at which they seemed\r\nto be much moved; and it was agreed that if it should be thought a\r\nproper measure, (of which I would inform them when I had consulted the\r\ncommittee,) a second petition should be sent to Parliament from the\r\ninhabitants, praying for the abolition of the Slave Trade. With this\r\nview I left them several of my _Summary View_, before mentioned, to\r\ndistribute, that the inhabitants might know more particularly the nature\r\nof the evil, against which they were going to complain. On my return to\r\nBristol, I determined to inquire into the truth of the reports that\r\nseamen had an aversion to enter, and that they were inveigled, if not\r\noften forced, into this hateful employment. For this purpose I was\r\nintroduced to a landlord of the name of Thompson, who kept a\r\npublic-house called the Seven Stars. He was a very intelligent man, was\r\naccustomed to receive sailors when discharged at the end of their\r\nvoyages, and to board them till their vessels went out again, or to find\r\nthem births in others. He avoided, however, all connexion with the Slave\r\nTrade, declaring that the credit of his house would be ruined if he were\r\nknown to send those, who put themselves under his care, into it.\r\n\r\nFrom him I collected the truth of all that had been stated to me on this\r\nsubject. But I told him I should not be satisfied until I had beheld\r\nthose scenes myself which he had described to me; and I entreated him to\r\ntake me into them, saying that I would reward him for all his time and\r\ntrouble, and that I would never forget him while I lived. To this he\r\nconsented; and as three or four slave-vessels at this time were\r\npreparing for their voyages, it was time that we should begin our\r\nrounds. At about twelve at night we generally set out, and were employed\r\ntill two and sometimes three in the morning. He led me from one of these\r\npublic-houses to another which the mates of the slave-vessels used to\r\nfrequent to pick up their hands. These houses were in Marsh-street, and\r\nmost of them were then kept by Irishmen. The scenes witnessed in these\r\nhouses were truly distressing to me; and yet, if I wished to know\r\npractically what I had purposed, I could not avoid them. Music, dancing,\r\nrioting, drunkenness, and profane swearing, were kept up from night to\r\nnight. The young mariner, if a stranger to the port, and unacquainted\r\nwith the nature of the Slave Trade, was sure to be picked up. The\r\nnovelty of the voyages, the superiority of the wages in this over any\r\nother trades, and the privileges of various kinds, were set before him.\r\nGulled in this manner, he was frequently enticed to the boat, which was\r\nwaiting to carry him away. If these prospects did not attract him, he\r\nwas plied with liquor till he became intoxicated, when a bargain was\r\nmade over him between the landlord and the mate. After this his senses\r\nwere kept in such a constant state of stupefaction by the liquor, that\r\nin time the former might do with him what he pleased. Seamen, also, were\r\nboarded in these houses, who, when the slave-ships were going out, but\r\nat no other time, were encouraged to spend more than they had money to\r\npay for; and to these, when they had thus exceeded, but one alternative\r\nwas given, namely, a slave-vessel or a gaol. These distressing scenes I\r\nfound myself obliged frequently to witness, for I was no less than\r\nnineteen times occupied in making these hateful rounds; and I can say\r\nfrom my own experience, and all the information I could collect from\r\nThompson and others, that no such practices were in use to obtain seamen\r\nfor other trades.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the seamen employed in the Slave Trade had so deeply\r\ninterested me, and now the manner of procuring them, that I was\r\ndetermined to make myself acquainted with their whole history; for I\r\nfound by report that they were not only personally ill-treated, as I\r\nhave already painfully described, but that they were robbed by artifice\r\nof those wages, which had been held up to them as so superior in this\r\nservice. All persons were obliged to sign articles that, in case they\r\nshould die or be discharged during the voyage, the wages then due to\r\nthem should be paid in the currency where the vessel carried her slaves,\r\nand that half of the wages due to them on their arrival there should be\r\npaid in the same manner, and that they were never permitted to read over\r\nthe articles they had signed. By means of this iniquitous practice the\r\nwages in the Slave Trade, though nominally higher in order to induce\r\nseamen to engage in it, were actually lower than in other trades. All\r\nthese usages I ascertained in such a manner, that no person could doubt\r\nthe truth of them. I actually obtained possession of articles of\r\nagreement belonging to these vessels, which had been signed and executed\r\nin former voyages. I made the merchants themselves, by sending those\r\nseamen who had claims upon them to ask for their accounts current with\r\ntheir respective ships, furnish me with such documents as would have\r\nbeen evidence against them in any court of law. On whatever branch of\r\nthe system I turned my eyes, I found it equally barbarous. The trade\r\nwas, in short, one mass of iniquity from the beginning to the end.\r\n\r\nI employed myself occasionally in the Merchant's-hall, in making copies\r\nof the muster-rolls of ships sailing to different parts of the world,\r\nthat I might make a comparative view of the loss of seamen in the Slave\r\nTrade, with that of those in the other trades from the same port. The\r\nresult of this employment showed me the importance of it: for, when I\r\nconsidered how partial the inhabitants of this country were to their\r\nfellow-citizens, the seamen belonging to it, and in what estimation the\r\nmembers of the legislature held them, by enforcing the Navigation Act,\r\nwhich they considered to be the bulwark of the nation, and by giving\r\nbounties to certain trades, that these might become so many nurseries\r\nfor the marine, I thought it of great importance, to be able to prove,\r\nas I was then capable of doing, that more persons would be found dead in\r\nthree slave-vessels from Bristol, in a given time, than in all the other\r\nvessels put together, numerous as they were, belonging to the same port.\r\n\r\nI procured also an account of the exports and imports for the year 1786,\r\nby means of which I was enabled to judge of the comparative value of\r\nthis and the other trades.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing another object, which was that of going on board the\r\nslave-ships, and learning their construction and dimensions, I was\r\ngreatly struck, and indeed affected, by the appearance of two little\r\nsloops, which were fitting out for Africa, the one of only twenty-five\r\ntons, which was said to be destined to carry seventy and the other of\r\nonly eleven, which was said to be destined to carry thirty slaves. I was\r\ntold also that which was more affecting, namely, that these were not to\r\nact as tenders on the coast, by going up and down the rivers, and\r\nreceiving three or four slaves at a time, and then carrying them to a\r\nlarge ship, which was to take them to the West Indies; but that it was\r\nactually intended, that they should transport their own slaves\r\nthemselves; that one if not both of them were, on their arrival in the\r\nWest Indies, to be sold as pleasure-vessels, and that the seamen\r\nbelonging to them were to be permitted to come home by what is usually\r\ncalled the run.\r\n\r\nThis account of the destination of these little vessels, though it was\r\ndistressing at first, appeared to me afterwards, on cool reasoning, to\r\nbe incredible. I thought that my informants wished to impose upon me, in\r\norder that I might make statements which would carry their own\r\nrefutation with them, and that thus I might injure the great cause which\r\nI had undertaken. And I was much inclined to be of this opinion, when I\r\nlooked again at the least of the two; for any person, who was tall,\r\nstanding upon dry ground by the side of her, might have overlooked every\r\nthing upon her deck. I knew also that she had been built as a\r\npleasure-boat for the accommodation of only six persons upon the Severn.\r\nI determined, therefore, to suspend my belief till I could take the\r\nadmeasurement of each vessel. This I did; but lest, in the agitation of\r\nmy mind on this occasion, I should have made any mistake, I desired my\r\nfriend George Fisher to apply to the builder for his admeasurement also.\r\nWith this he kindly complied. When he obtained it he brought it me. This\r\naccount, which nearly corresponded with my own, was as follows:--In the\r\nvessel of twenty-five tons, the length of the upper part of the hold, or\r\nroof of the room, where the seventy slaves were to be stowed, was but\r\nlittle better than ten yards, or thirty-one feet. The greatest breadth\r\nof the bottom, or floor, was ten feet four inches; and the least five.\r\nHence, a grown person must sit down all the voyage, and contract his\r\nlimbs within the narrow limits of three square feet. In the vessel of\r\neleven tons, the length of the room for the thirty slaves was twenty-two\r\nfeet. The greatest breadth of the floor was eight, and the least four.\r\nThe whole height from the keel to the beam was but five feet eight\r\ninches, three feet of which were occupied by ballast, cargo, and\r\nprovisions, so that two feet eight inches remained only as the height\r\nbetween the decks. Hence, each slave would have only four square feet to\r\nsit in, and, when in this posture, his head, if he were a full-grown\r\nperson, would touch the ceiling, or upper deck.\r\n\r\nHaving now received this admeasurement from the builder, which was\r\nrather more favourable than my own, I looked upon the destination of\r\nthese little vessels as yet more incredible than before. Still the\r\ndifferent persons, whom I occasionally saw on board them, persisted in\r\nit that they were going to Africa for slaves, and also for the numbers\r\nmentioned, which they were afterwards to carry to the West Indies\r\nthemselves. I desired, however, my friends, George Fisher, Truman\r\nHarford, Harry Gandy, Walter Chandler, and others, each to make a\r\nseparate inquiry for me on this subject; and they all agreed that,\r\nimprobable as the account both of their destination, and of the number\r\nthey were to take, might appear, they had found it to be too true. I had\r\nsoon afterwards the sorrow to learn from official documents from the\r\nCustom-house, that these little vessels actually cleared out for Africa,\r\nand that now nothing could be related so barbarous of this traffic,\r\nwhich might not instantly be believed.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing my different objects there was one, which, to my great\r\nvexation, I found it extremely difficult to attain. This was the\r\nprocuring of any assurance from those who had been personally acquainted\r\nwith the horrors of this trade, that they would appear, if called upon,\r\nas evidence against it. My friend Harry Gandy, to whom I had been first\r\nintroduced, had been two voyages, as I before mentioned; and he was\r\nwilling, though at an advanced age, to go to London, to state publicly\r\nall he knew concerning them. But with respect to the many others in\r\nBristol, who had been to the coast of Africa, I had not yet found one\r\nwho would come forward for this purpose. There were several old Slave\r\nCaptains living there, who had a great knowledge of the subject. I\r\nthought it not unreasonable that I might gain one or two good evidences\r\nout of these, as they had probably long ago left the concern, and were\r\nnot now interested in the continuance of it; but all my endeavours were\r\nfruitless. I sent messages to them by different persons. I met them in\r\nall ways. I stated to them, that if there was nothing objectionable in\r\nthe trade, seeing it laboured under such a stigma, they had an\r\nopportunity of coming forward and of wiping away the stain. If, on the\r\nother hand, it was as bad as represented, then they had it in their\r\npower, by detailing the crimes which attached to it, of making some\r\nreparation or atonement, for the part they had taken in it. But no\r\nrepresentations would do. All intercourse was positively forbidden\r\nbetween us; and whenever they met me in the street, they shunned me as\r\nif I had been a mad dog. I could not for some time account, for the\r\nstrange disposition which they thus manifested towards me; but my\r\nfriends helped me to unravel it, for I was assured that one or two of\r\nthem, though they went no longer to Africa as captains, were in part\r\nowners of vessels trading there; and, with respect to all of them, it\r\nmight be generally said, that they had been guilty of such enormities,\r\nthat they would be afraid of coming forward in the way I proposed, lest\r\nany thing should come out by which they might criminate themselves. I\r\nwas obliged then to give up all hope of getting any evidence from this\r\nquarter, and I saw but little prospect of getting it from those, who\r\nwere then actually deriving their livelihood from the trade: and yet I\r\nwas determined to persevere; for I thought that some might be found in\r\nit who were not yet so hardened as to be incapable of being awakened on\r\nthis subject. I thought that others might be found in it who wished to\r\nleave it upon principle, and that these would unbosom themselves to me:\r\nand I thought it not improbable that I might fall in with others, who\r\nhad come unexpectedly into a state of independence, and that these might\r\nbe induced, as their livelihood would be no longer affected by giving me\r\ninformation, to speak the truth.\r\n\r\nI persevered for weeks together under this hope, but could find no one\r\nof all those, who had been applied to, who would have any thing to say\r\nto me. At length, Walter Chandler had prevailed upon a young gentleman,\r\nof the name of Gardiner, who was going out as surgeon of the Pilgrim, to\r\nmeet me. The condition was, that we were to meet at the house of the\r\nformer, but that we were to enter in and go out at different times, that\r\nis, we were not to be seen together.\r\n\r\nGardiner, on being introduced to me, said at once, that he had often\r\nwished to see me on the subject of my errand, but that the owner of the\r\nPilgrim had pointed me out to him as a person whom he would wish him to\r\navoid. He then laid open to me the different methods of obtaining slaves\r\nin Africa, as he had learned from those on board his own vessel in his\r\nfirst, or former, voyage. He unfolded also the manner of their treatment\r\nin the Middle passage, with the various distressing scenes which had\r\noccurred in it.  He stated the barbarous usuage of the seamen as he had\r\nwitnessed it, and concluded by saying, that there never was a subject\r\nwhich demanded so loudly the interference of the legislature as that of\r\nthe Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his narrative, and answered the different questions\r\nwhich I had proposed to him concerning it, I asked him, in as delicate a\r\nmanner as I could, how it happened, that, seeing the trade in this\r\nhorrible light, he had consented to follow it again? He told me frankly,\r\nthat he had received a regular medical education, but that his\r\nrelations, being poor, had not been able to set him up in his\r\nprofession. He had saved a little money in his last voyage. In that,\r\nwhich he was now to perform, he hoped to save a little more. With the\r\nprofits of both voyages together, he expected he should be able to\r\nfurnish a shop in the line of his profession, when he would wipe his\r\nhands of this detestable trade.\r\n\r\nI then asked him, whether, upon the whole, he thought he had judged\r\nprudently, or whether the prospect of thus enabling himself to become\r\nindependent, would counterbalance the uneasiness which might arise in\r\nfuture? He replied, that he had not so much to fear upon this account.\r\nThe trade, while it continued, must have surgeons. But it made a great\r\ndifference both to the crew and to the slaves, whether these discharged\r\ntheir duty towards them in a feeling manner, or not. With respect to\r\nhimself, he was sure that he should pay every attention to the wants of\r\neach. This thought made his continuance in the trade for one voyage\r\nlonger more reconcilable. But he added, as if not quite satisfied,\r\n\"Cruel necessity!\" and he fetched a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nWe took our leave, and departed, the one a few minutes after the other.\r\nThe conversation of this young man was very interesting. I was much\r\nimpressed both by the nature and the manner of it. I wished to secure\r\nhim, if possible, as an evidence for parliament, and thus save him from\r\nhis approaching voyage: but I knew not what to do. At first, I thought\r\nit would be easy to raise a subscription to set him up. But then, I was\r\naware that this might be considered as bribery, and make his testimony\r\nworth nothing. I then thought that the committee might detain him as an\r\nevidence, and pay him, in a reasonable manner, for his sustenance, till\r\nhis testimony should be called for. But I did not know how long it would\r\nbe before his examination might take place. It might be a year or two. I\r\nforesaw other difficulties also and I was obliged to relinquish what\r\notherwise I should have deemed a prize.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing the conversation which had passed between us after my\r\nreturn home, I thought, considering the friendly disposition of Gardiner\r\ntowards us, I had not done all I could for the cause; and, communicating\r\nmy feelings to Walter Chandler, he procured me another interview. At\r\nthis, I asked him, if he would become an evidence if he lived to return.\r\nHe replied, very heartily, that he would. I then asked him, if he would\r\nkeep a journal of facts during his voyage, as it would enable him to\r\nspeak more correctly, in case he should be called upon for his\r\ntestimony. He assured me he would, and that he would make up a little\r\nbook for that purpose. I asked him, lastly, when he meant to sail. He\r\nsaid, as soon as the ship could get all her hands. It was their\r\nintention to sail to-morrow, but that seven men, whom the mates had\r\nbrought drunk out of Marsh-street the evening before, were so terrified\r\nwhen they found they were going to Africa, that they had seized the boat\r\nthat morning, and had put themselves on shore. I took my leave of him,\r\nentreating him to follow his resolutions of kindness both to the sailors\r\nand the slaves, and wished him a speedy and a safe return.\r\n\r\nOn going one day by the Exchange, after this interview with Gardiner, I\r\noverheard a young gentleman say to another, \"that it happened on the\r\ncoast, last year, and that he saw it.\" I wished to know who he was, and\r\nto get at him if I could. I watched him at a distance for more than half\r\nan hour, when I saw him leave his companion. I followed him till he\r\nentered a house. I then considered whether it would be proper, and in\r\nwhat manner, to address him when he should come out of it. But I waited\r\nthree hours, and I never saw him. I then concluded that he either lodged\r\nwhere I saw him enter, or that he had gone to dine with some friend. I\r\ntherefore took notice of the house, and, showing it afterwards to\r\nseveral of my friends, desired them to make him out for me. In a day or\r\ntwo I had an interview with him. His name was James Arnold. He had been\r\ntwo voyages to the coast of Africa for slaves; one as a surgeon's mate\r\nin the Alexander, in the year 1785, and the other as surgeon in the\r\nLittle Pearl, in the year 1786, from which he had not then very long\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nI asked him if he was willing to give me any account of these voyages,\r\nfor that I was making an inquiry into the nature of the Slave Trade. He\r\nreplied, he knew that I was. He had been cautioned about falling in with\r\nme; he had, however, taken no pains to avoid me. It was a bad trade, and\r\nought to be exposed.\r\n\r\nI went over the same ground as I had gone with Gardiner relative to the\r\nfirst of these voyages; or that in the Alexander. It is not necessary to\r\ndetail the particulars. It is impossible, however, not to mention, that\r\nthe treatment of the seamen on board this vessel was worse than I had\r\never before heard of. No less than eleven of them; unable to bear their\r\nlives; had deserted at Bonny, on the coast of Africa,--which is a most\r\nunusual thing,--choosing all that could be endured, though in a most\r\ninhospitable climate, and in the power of the natives, rather than to\r\ncontinue in their own ship. Nine others also, in addition to the loss of\r\nthese, had died in the same voyage. As to the rest; he believed, without\r\nany exception, that they had been badly used.\r\n\r\nIn examining him with respect to his second voyage, or that in the\r\nLittle Pearl, two circumstances came out with respect to the slaves,\r\nwhich I shall relate in few words.\r\n\r\nThe chief mate used to beat the men-slaves on very trifling occasions.\r\nAbout eleven one evening, the ship then lying off the coast, he heard a\r\nnoise in their room. He jumped down among them with the lanthorn in his\r\nhand. Two of those who had been ill-used by him, forced themselves out\r\nof their irons, and, seizing him, struck him with the bolt of them, and\r\nit was with some difficulty that he was extricated from them by the\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nThe men-slaves, unable now to punish him, and finding they had created\r\nan alarm, began to proceed to extremities. They endeavoured to force\r\nthemselves up the gratings, and to pull down a partition which had been\r\nmade for a sick-birth; when they were fired upon and repressed. The next\r\nmorning they were brought up one by one; when it appeared that a boy had\r\nbeen killed, who was afterwards thrown into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe two men, however, who had forced themselves out of irons, did not\r\ncome up with the rest, but found their way into the hold, and armed\r\nthemselves with knives from a cask, which had been opened for trade. One\r\nof them being called to in the African tongue by a black trader, who was\r\nthen on board, came up, but with a knife in each hand; when one of the\r\ncrew, supposing him yet hostile, shot him in the right side and killed\r\nhim on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe other remained in the hold for twelve hours. Scalding water mixed\r\nwith fat was poured down upon him, to make him come up. Though his flesh\r\nwas painfully blistered by these means, he kept below. A promise was\r\nthen made to him in the African tongue by the same trader, that no\r\ninjury should be done him if he would come among them. To this at length\r\nhe consented; but on observing, when he was about half way up, that a\r\nsailor was armed between decks, he flew to him, and clasped him, and\r\nthrew him down. The sailor fired his pistol in the scuffle, but without\r\neffect; he contrived, however, to fracture his skull with the butt end\r\nof it, so that the slave died on the third day.\r\n\r\nThe second circumstance took place after the arrival of the same vessel\r\nat St. Vincent's. There was a boy-slave on board, who was very ill and\r\nemaciated. The mate, who, by his cruelty, had been the author of the\r\nformer mischief, did not choose to expose him to sale with the rest,\r\nlest the small sum he would fetch in that situation should lower the\r\naverage price, and thus bring down[A] the value of the privileges of the\r\nofficers of the ship. This boy was kept on board, and no provisions\r\nallowed him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Officers are said to be allowed the privilege of one or\r\nmore slaves, according to their rank. When the cargo is sold, the sum\r\ntotal fetched is put down, and this being divided by the number of\r\nslaves sold, gives the average price of each. Such officers, then,\r\nreceive this average price for one or more slaves, according to their\r\nprivileges, but never the slaves themselves.]\r\n\r\nThe mate had suggested the propriety of throwing him overboard, but no\r\none would do it. On the ninth day he expired, having never been allowed\r\nany sustenance during that time.\r\n\r\nI asked Mr. Arnold if he was willing to give evidence of these facts in\r\nboth cases. He said he had only one objection, which was, that in two or\r\nthree days he was to go in the Ruby on his third voyage: but on leaving\r\nme, he said, that he would take an affidavit before the mayor of the\r\ntruth of any of those things which he had related to me, if that would\r\ndo; but, from motives of safety, he should not choose to do this till\r\nwithin a few hours before he sailed.\r\n\r\nIn two or three days after this he sent for me; he said the Ruby would\r\nleave King-road the next day, and that he was ready to do as he had\r\npromised. Depositions were accordingly made out from his own words. I\r\nwent with him to the residence of George Daubeny, Esq., who was then\r\nchief magistrate of the city, and they were sworn to in his presence,\r\nand witnessed as the law requires.\r\n\r\nOn taking my leave of him, I asked him how he could go a third time in\r\nsuch a barbarous employ; he said he had been distressed. In his voyage\r\nin the Alexander he had made nothing; for he had been so ill-used, that\r\nhe had solicited his discharge in Grenada, where, being paid in\r\ncurrency, he had but little to receive. When he arrived in Bristol from\r\nthat island, he was quite penniless; and finding the Little Pearl going\r\nout, he was glad to get on board her as her surgeon, which he then did\r\nentirely for the sake of bread. He said, moreover, that she was but a\r\nsmall vessel, and that his savings had been but small in her. This\r\noccasioned him to apply for the Ruby, his present ship; but if he\r\nsurvived this voyage he would never go another. I then put the same\r\nquestion to him as to Gardiner, and he promised to keep a journal of\r\nfacts, and to give his evidence, if called upon, on his return.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see, from this account, the difficulty I had in\r\nprocuring evidence from this port. The owners of vessels employed in the\r\ntrade there forbade all intercourse with me; the old captains, who had\r\nmade their fortunes in it, would not see me; the young, who were making\r\nthem, could not be supposed to espouse my cause, to the detriment of\r\ntheir own interest. Of those whose necessities made them go into it for\r\na livelihood, I could not get one to come forward, without doing so much\r\nfor him as would have amounted to bribery. Thus, when I got one of these\r\ninto my possession, I was obliged to let him go again. I was, however,\r\ngreatly consoled by the consideration, that I had procured two sentinels\r\nto be stationed in the enemy's camp, who keeping a journal of different\r\nfacts, would bring me some important intelligence at a future period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nAuthor goes to Monmouth; confers relative to a petition from that\r\nplace; returns to Bristol; is introduced to Alexander Falconbridge;\r\ntakes one of the mates of the Africa out of that ship; visits disabled\r\nseamen from the ship Thomas; puts a chief mate into prison for the\r\nmurder of William Lines.--Ill-usage of seamen in various other\r\nslave-vessels; secures Crutwell's Bath paper in favour of the\r\nabolition; lays the foundation of a committee at Bristol; and of a\r\npetition from thence also; takes his leave of that city.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time I began to feel the effect of my labours upon my\r\nconstitution. It had been my practice to go home in the evening to my\r\nlodgings, about twelve o'clock, and then to put down the occurrences of\r\nthe day. This usually kept me up till one, and sometimes till nearly two\r\nin the morning. When I went my rounds in Marsh-street, I seldom got home\r\ntill two, and into bed till three. My clothes, also, were frequently wet\r\nthrough with the rains. The cruel accounts I was daily in the habit of\r\nhearing, both with respect to the slaves, and to the seamen employed in\r\nthis wicked trade, from which, indeed, my mind had no respite, often\r\nbroke my sleep in the night, and occasioned me to awake in an agitated\r\nstate. All these circumstances concurred in affecting my health; I\r\nlooked thin; my countenance became yellow; I had also rheumatic\r\nfeelings. My friends, seeing this, prevailed upon me to give myself two\r\nor three days' relaxation; and as a gentleman, of whom I had some\r\nknowledge, was going into Carmarthenshire, I accompanied him as far as\r\nMonmouth.\r\n\r\nAfter our parting at this place, I became restless and uneasy, and\r\nlonged to get back to my work. I thought, however, my journey ought not\r\nto be wholly useless to the cause; and hearing that Dr. Davis, a\r\nclergyman at Monmouth, was a man of considerable weight among the\r\ninhabitants, I took the liberty of writing him a letter, in which I\r\nstated who I was and the way in which I had lately employed myself, and\r\nthe great wish I had to be favoured with an interview with him; and I\r\ndid not conceal that it would be very desirable, if the inhabitants of\r\nthe place could have that information on the subject which would warrant\r\nthem in so doing, that they should petition the legislature for the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade. Dr. Davis returned me an answer, and\r\nreceived me. The questions which he put to me were judicious. He asked\r\nme, first, whether, if the slaves were emancipated, there would not be\r\nmuch confusion in the islands? I told him that the emancipation of them\r\nwas no part of our plan; we solicited nothing but the stopping of all\r\nfuture importations of them into the islands. He then asked what the\r\nplanters would do for labourers? I replied, they would find sufficient\r\nfrom an increase of the native population, if they were obliged to pay\r\nattention to the latter means. We discoursed a long time upon this last\r\ntopic. I have not room to give the many other questions he proposed to\r\nme: no one was ever more judiciously questioned. In my turn, I put him\r\ninto possession of all the discoveries I had made. He acknowledged the\r\ninjustice of the trade; he confessed, also, that my conversation had\r\nenlightened him as to the impolicy of it; and, taking some of my\r\n_Summary View_ to distribute, he said he hoped that the inhabitants\r\nwould, after the perusal of them, accede to my request.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Bristol, my friends had procured for me an interview\r\nwith Mr. Alexander Falconbridge, who had been to the coast of Africa, as\r\na surgeon, for four voyages; one in the Tartar, another in the\r\nAlexander, and two in the Emilia slave-vessels.\r\n\r\nOn my introduction to him, I asked him if he had any objection to give\r\nme an account of the cruelties which were said to be connected with the\r\nSlave Trade; he answered, without any reserve, that he had not; for that\r\nhe had now done with it. Never were any words more welcome to my ears\r\nthan these: \"Yes--I have done with the trade;\"--and he said, also, that\r\nhe was free to give me information concerning it. Was he not then one of\r\nthe very persons, whom I had so long been seeking, but in vain?\r\n\r\nTo detail the accounts which he gave me at this and at subsequent\r\ninterviews, relative to the different branches of this trade, would fill\r\nno ordinary volume. Suffice it to say, in general terms, as far as\r\nrelates to the slaves, that he confirmed the various violent and\r\ntreacherous methods of procuring them in their own country; their\r\nwretched condition, in consequence of being crowded together in the\r\npassage; their attempts to rise in defence of their own freedom, and,\r\nwhen this was impracticable, to destroy themselves by the refusal of\r\nsustenance, by jumping overboard into the sea, and in other ways; the\r\neffect also of their situation upon their minds, by producing insanity\r\nand various diseases; and the cruel manner of disposing of them in the\r\nWest Indies, and of separating relatives and friends.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the seamen employed in this trade, he commended Captain\r\nFrazer for his kind usage to them, under whom he had so long served. The\r\nhandsome way in which he spoke of the latter pleased me much, because I\r\nwas willing to deduce from it his own impartiality, and because I\r\nthought I might infer from it, also, his regard to truth as to other\r\nparts of his narrative. Indeed I had been before acquainted with this\r\ncircumstance. Thompson, of the Seven Stars, had informed me that Frazer\r\nwas the only man sailing out of that port for slaves who had not been\r\nguilty of cruelty to his seamen: and Mr. Burges alluded to it, when he\r\ngave me advice not to proceed against the captain of the Alfred; for he\r\nthen said, as I mentioned in a former chapter, \"that he knew but one\r\ncaptain in the trade, who did not deserve long ago to be hanged.\" Mr.\r\nFalconbridge, however, stated, that though he had been thus fortunate in\r\nthe Tartar and Emilia, he had been as unfortunate in the Alexander; for\r\nhe believed there were no instances upon naval record, taken altogether,\r\nof greater barbarity, than of that which had been exercised towards the\r\nseamen in this voyage. In running over these, it struck me that I had\r\nheard of the same from some other quarter, or at least that these were\r\nso like the others, that I was surprised at their coincidence. On taking\r\nout my notes, I looked for the names of those whom I recollected to have\r\nbeen used in this manner; and on desiring Mr. Falconbridge to mention\r\nthe names of those, also, to whom he alluded, they turned out to be the\r\nsame. The mystery, however, was soon cleared up, when I told him from\r\nwhom I had received my intelligence: for Mr. Arnold, the last-mentioned\r\nperson in the last chapter, had been surgeon's mate under Mr.\r\nFalconbridge in the same vessel.\r\n\r\nThere was one circumstance of peculiar importance, but quite new to me,\r\nwhich I collected from the information which Mr. Falconbridge had given\r\nme. This was, that many of the seamen, who left the slave-ships in the\r\nWest Indies, were in such a weak, ulcerated, and otherwise diseased\r\nstate, that they perished there. Several, also, of those who came home\r\nwith the vessels were in the same deplorable condition. This was the\r\ncase, Mr. Falconbridge said, with some who returned in the Alexander. It\r\nwas the case, also, with many others; for he had been a pupil for twelve\r\nmonths in the Bristol Infirmary, and had had ample means of knowing the\r\nfact. The greatest number of seamen, at almost all times, who were\r\nthere, were from the slave-vessels. These, too, were usually there on\r\naccount of disease, whereas those from other ships were usually there on\r\naccount of accidents. The health of some of the former was so far\r\ndestroyed, that they were never wholly to be restored. This information\r\nwas of great importance; for it showed that they who were reported dead\r\nupon the muster-rolls, were not all that were lost to the country by the\r\nprosecution of this wicked trade. Indeed, it was of so much importance,\r\nthat in all my future interviews with others, which were for the purpose\r\nof collecting evidence, I never forgot to make it a subject of inquiry.\r\n\r\nI can hardly say how precious I considered the facts with which Mr.\r\nFalconbridge had furnished me from his own experience, relative to the\r\ndifferent branches of this commerce. They were so precious, that I began\r\nnow to be troubled lest I should lose them. For, though he had thus\r\nprivately unbosomed himself to me, it did not follow that he would come\r\nforward as a public evidence. I was not a little uneasy on this account.\r\nI was fearful lest, when I should put this question to him, his future\r\nplan of life, or some little narrow consideration of future interest,\r\nwould prevent him from giving his testimony, and I delayed asking him\r\nfor many days. During this time, however, I frequently visited him; and\r\nat length, when I thought I was better acquainted, and probably in some\r\nlittle estimation, with him, I ventured to open my wishes on this\r\nsubject. He answered me boldly, and at once, that he had left the trade\r\nupon principle, and that he would state all he knew concerning it,\r\neither publicly or privately, and at any time when he should be called\r\nupon to do it. This answer produced such an effect upon me, after all my\r\nformer disappointments, that I felt it all over my frame. It operated\r\nlike a sudden shock, which often disables the impressed person for a\r\ntime. So the joy I felt rendered me quite useless, as to business, for\r\nthe remainder of the day.\r\n\r\nI began to perceive in a little time the advantage of having cultivated\r\nan acquaintance with Thompson of the Seven Stars. For nothing could now\r\npass in Bristol, relative to the seamen employed in this trade, but it\r\nwas soon brought to me. If there was anything amiss, I had so arranged\r\nmatters that I was sure to hear of it. He sent for me one day to inform\r\nme that several of the seamen, who had been sent out of Marsh Street\r\ninto the Prince, which was then at Kingroad, and on the point of sailing\r\nto Africa for slaves, had, through fear of ill usage on the voyage,\r\ntaken the boat and put themselves on shore. He informed me, at the same\r\ntime, that the seamen of the Africa, which was lying there also, and\r\nready to sail on a like voyage, were not satisfied, for that they had\r\nbeen made to sign their articles of agreement without being permitted to\r\nsee them. To this he added, that Mr. Sheriff, one of the mates of the\r\nlatter vessel, was unhappy, also, on this account. Sheriff had been a\r\nmate in the West India trade, and was a respectable man in his line. He\r\nhad been enticed by the captain of the Africa, under the promise of\r\npeculiar advantages, to change his voyage. Having a wife and family at\r\nBristol, he was willing to make a sacrifice on their account: but when\r\nhe himself was not permitted to read the articles, he began to suspect\r\nbad work, and that there would be nothing but misery in the approaching\r\nvoyage. Thompson entreated me to extricate him if I could. He was sure,\r\nhe said, if he went to the coast with that man, meaning the captain,\r\nthat he would never return alive.\r\n\r\nI was very unwilling to refuse anything to Thompson. I was deeply bound\r\nto him in gratitude for the many services he had rendered me, but I\r\nscarcely saw how I could serve him on this occasion. I promised,\r\nhowever, to speak to him in an hour's time. I consulted my friend Truman\r\nHarford in the interim; and the result was, that he and I should proceed\r\nto Kingroad in a boat, go on board the Africa, and charge the captain in\r\nperson with what he had done, and desire him to discharge Sheriff, as no\r\nagreement, where fraud or force was used in the signatures, could be\r\ndeemed valid. If we were not able to extricate Sheriff by these means,\r\nwe thought that at least we should know, by inquiring of those whom we\r\nshould see on board, whether the measure of hindering the men from\r\nseeing their articles on signing them had been adopted. It would be\r\nuseful to ascertain this because such a measure had been long reported\r\nto be usual in this, but was said to be unknown in any other trade.\r\n\r\nHaving passed the river's mouth, and rowed towards the sea, we came near\r\nthe Prince first, but pursued our destination to the Africa. Mr. Sheriff\r\nwas the person who received us on board. I did not know him till I asked\r\nhis name. I then told him my errand, with which he seemed to be much\r\npleased. On asking him to tell the captain that I wished to speak with\r\nhim, he replied that he was on shore. This put me to great difficulty,\r\nas I did not know then what to do. I consulted with Truman Harford, and\r\nit was our opinion that we should inquire of the seamen, but in a very\r\nquiet manner, by going individually to each, if they had ever demanded\r\nto see the articles on signing them, and if they had been refused. We\r\nproposed this question to them. They replied, that the captain had\r\nrefused them in a savage manner, making use of threats and oaths. There\r\nwas not one contradictory voice on this occasion. We then asked Mr.\r\nSheriff what we were to do. He entreated us by all means to take him on\r\nshore. He was sure that under such a man as the captain, and\r\nparticularly after the circumstance of our coming on board should be\r\nmade known to him, he would never come from the coast of Africa alive.\r\nUpon this, Truman Harford called me aside, and told me the danger of\r\ntaking an officer from the ship; for that, if any accident should happen\r\nto her, the damage might all fall upon me. I then inquired of Mr.\r\nSheriff if there was any officer on board who could manage the ship. He\r\npointed one out to me, and I spoke to him in the cabin. This person told\r\nme I need be under no apprehension about the vessel, but that every one\r\nwould be sorry to lose Mr. Sheriff. Upon this ground, Truman Harford,\r\nwho had felt more for me than for himself, became now easy. We had\r\nbefore concluded, that the obtaining any signature by fraud or force\r\nwould render the agreement illegal. We therefore joined in opinion, that\r\nwe might take away the man. His chest was accordingly put into our boat.\r\nWe jumped into it with our rowers, and he followed us, surrounded by the\r\nseamen, all of whom took an affectionate leave of him, and expressed\r\ntheir regret at parting. Soon after this there was a general cry of\r\n\"Will you take me, too?\" from the deck; and such a sudden movement\r\nappeared there, that we were obliged to push off directly from the side,\r\nfearing that many would jump into our boat and go with us.\r\n\r\nAfter having left the ship, Sheriff corroborated the desertion of the\r\nseamen from the Prince, as before related to me by Thompson. He spoke\r\nalso of the savage disposition of his late captain, which he had even\r\ndared to manifest through lying in an English port. I was impressed by\r\nthis account of his rough manners; and the wind having risen before and\r\nthe surf now rolling heavily, I began to think what an escape I might\r\nhave had; how easy it would have been for the savage captain, if he had\r\nbeen on board, or for any one at his instigation, to have pushed me over\r\nthe ship's side. This was the first time I had ever considered the peril\r\nof the undertaking. But we arrived safe; and though on the same evening\r\nI left my name at the captain's house, as that of the person who had\r\ntaken away his mate, I never heard more about it.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing my inquiries into the new topic suggested by Mr.\r\nFalconbridge, I learnt that two or three of the seamen of the ship\r\nThomas, which had arrived now nearly a year from the Coast, were in a\r\nvery crippled and deplorable state; I accordingly went to see them. One\r\nof them had been attacked by a fever, arising from circumstances\r\nconnected with these voyages. The inflammation, which had proceeded from\r\nit, had reached his eyes; it could not be dispersed; and the consequence\r\nwas, that he was then blind. The second was lame; he had badly ulcerated\r\nlegs, and appeared to be very weak. The third was a mere spectre; I\r\nthink he was the most pitiable object I ever saw. I considered him as\r\nirrecoverably gone. They all complained to me of their bad usage on\r\nboard the Thomas. They said they had heard, of my being in Bristol, and\r\nthey hoped I would not leave it without inquiring into the murder of\r\nWilliam Lines.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring who William Lines was, they informed me that he had been\r\none of the crew of the same ship, and that all on board believed that he\r\nhad been killed by the chief mate; but they themselves had not been\r\npresent when the blows were given him; they had not seen him till\r\nafterwards; but their shipmates had told them of his cruel treatment,\r\nand they knew that soon afterwards he had died.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next day, the mother of Lines, who lived in\r\nBristol, came to me and related the case. I told her there was no\r\nevidence as to the fact, for that I had seen three seamen, who could not\r\nspeak to it from their own knowledge. She said, there were four others\r\nthen in Bristol who could; I desired her to fetch them. When they\r\narrived I examined each separately, and cross-examined them in the best\r\nmanner I was able; I could find no variation in their account, and I was\r\nquite convinced that the murder had taken place. The mother was then\r\nimportunate that I should take up the case. I was too much affected by\r\nthe narration I had heard to refuse her wholly, and yet I did not\r\npromise that I would; I begged a little time to consider of it. During\r\nthis I thought of consulting my friend Burges, but I feared he would\r\nthrow cold water upon it, as he had done in the case of the captain of\r\nthe Alfred. I remembered well what he had then said to me, and yet I\r\nfelt a strong disposition to proceed, for the trade was still going on.\r\nEvery day, perhaps, some new act of barbarity was taking place; and one\r\nexample, if made, might counteract the evil for a time. I seemed\r\ntherefore to incline to stir in this matter, and thought, if I should\r\nget into any difficulty about it, it would be better to do it without\r\nconsulting Mr. Burges, than, after having done it, to fly as it were in\r\nhis face. I then sent for the woman, and told her that she might appear\r\nwith the witnesses at the Common Hall, where the magistrates usually sat\r\non a certain day.\r\n\r\nWe all met at the time appointed, and I determined to sit as near to the\r\nmayor as I could get. The hall was unusually crowded. One or two\r\nslave-merchants, and two or three others, who were largely concerned in\r\nthe West India trade, were upon the bench; for I had informed the mayor\r\nthe day before of my intention, and he, it appeared, had informed them.\r\nI shall never forget the savage looks which these people gave me; which\r\nindeed were so remarkable, as to occasion the eyes of the whole court to\r\nbe turned upon me. They looked as if they were going to speak to me, and\r\nthe people looked as if they expected me to say something in return.\r\nThey then got round the mayor, and began to whisper to him, as I\r\nsupposed, on the business before it should come on. One of them,\r\nhowever, said aloud to the former, but fixing his eyes upon me, and\r\nwishing me to overhear him, \"Scandalous reports had lately been spread,\r\nbut sailors were not used worse in Guineamen than in other vessels.\"\r\nThis brought the people's eyes upon me again; I was very much irritated,\r\nbut I thought it improper to say anything. Another, looking savagely at\r\nme, said to the mayor, \"that he had known Captain Vicars a long time;\r\nthat he was an honourable man[A], and would not allow such usage in his\r\nship. There were always vagabonds to hatch up things;\" and he made a\r\ndead point at me, by putting himself into a posture which attracted the\r\nnotice of those present, and by staring me in the face. I could now no\r\nlonger restrain myself, and I said aloud, in as modest manner as I\r\ncould, \"You, sir, may know many things which I do not; but this I know,\r\nthat if you do not do your duty, you are amenable to a higher court.\"\r\nThe mayor upon this looked at me, and directly my friend Mr. Burges, who\r\nwas sitting as the clerk to the magistrates, went to him and whispered\r\nsomething in his ear; after which all private conversation between the\r\nmayor and others ceased, and the hearing was ordered to come on.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: We may well imagine what this person's notion of another\r\nman's honour was; for he was the purser of the Brothers and of the\r\nAlfred, who, as before mentioned, sent the captains of those ships out a\r\nsecond voyage; after knowing their barbarities in the former; and he was\r\nalso the purser of this very ship Thomas, where the murder had been\r\ncommitted. I by no means, however, wish by these observations to detract\r\nfrom the character of Captain Vicars, as he had no concern in the cruel\r\ndeed.]\r\n\r\nI shall not detain the reader by giving an account of the evidence which\r\nthen transpired. The four witnesses were examined, and the case was so\r\nfar clear; Captain Vicars, however, was sent for. On being questioned,\r\nhe did not deny that there had been bad usage, but said that the young\r\nman had died of the flux. But this assertion went for nothing when\r\nbalanced against the facts which had come out; and this was so evident,\r\nthat an order was made out for the apprehension of the chief mate. He\r\nwas accordingly taken up. The next day, however, there was a rehearing\r\nof the case, when he was returned to the gaol, where he was to lie till\r\nthe Lords of the Admiralty should order a sessions to be held for the\r\ntrial of offences committed on the high seas.\r\n\r\nThis public examination of the case of William Lines, and the way in\r\nwhich it ended, produced an extraordinary result; for after this time\r\nthe slave-captains and mates who used to meet me suddenly, used as\r\nsuddenly to start from me, indeed to the other side of the pavement, as\r\nif I had been a wolf, or tiger, or some dangerous beast of prey. Such of\r\nthem as saw me beforehand used to run up the cross streets or lanes,\r\nwhich were nearest to them, to get away. Seamen, too, came from various\r\nquarters to apply to me for redress. One came to me who had been treated\r\nill in the Alexander, when Mr. Falconbridge had been the surgeon of her.\r\nThree came to me who had been ill-used in the voyage which followed,\r\nthough she had then sailed under a new captain. Two applied to me from\r\nthe Africa, who had been of her crew in the last voyage. Two from the\r\nFly. Two from the Wasp. One from the Little Pearl, and three from the\r\nPilgrim or Princess, when she was last upon the coast.\r\n\r\nThe different scenes of barbarity which these represented to me, greatly\r\nadded to the affliction of my mind. My feelings became now almost\r\ninsupportable. I was agonized to think that this trade should last\r\nanother day. I was in a state of agitation from morning till night. I\r\ndetermined I would soon leave Bristol. I saw nothing but misery in the\r\nplace. I had collected now, I believed, all the evidence it would\r\nafford; and to stay in it a day longer than was necessary, would be only\r\nan interruption for so much time both of my happiness and of my health.\r\nI determined therefore to do only two or three things, which I thought\r\nto be proper, and to depart in a few days.\r\n\r\nAnd first I went to Bath, where I endeavoured to secure the respectable\r\npaper belonging to that city in favour of the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade. This I did entirely to my satisfaction, by relating to the worthy\r\neditor all the discoveries I had made, and by impressing his mind in a\r\nforcible manner on the subject. And it is highly to the honour of Mr.\r\nCrutwell, that from that day he never ceased to defend our cause; that\r\nhe never made a charge for insertions of any kind; but that he\r\nconsidered all he did upon this occasion in the light of a duty, or as\r\nhis mite given in charity to a poor and oppressed people.\r\n\r\nThe next attempt was to lay the foundation of a committee in Bristol,\r\nand of a petition to Parliament from it for the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade. I had now made many friends. A gentleman of the name of Paynter\r\nhad felt himself much interested in my labours. Mr. Joseph Harford, a\r\nman of fortune, of great respectability of character, and of\r\nconsiderable influence, had attached himself to the cause. Dr. Fox had\r\nassisted me in it. Mr. Hughes, a clergyman of the baptist church, was\r\nanxious and ready to serve it. Dr. Camplin, of the establishment, with\r\nseveral of his friends, continued steady. Matthew Wright, James Harford,\r\nTruman Harford, and all the Quakers to a man, were strenuous, and this\r\non the best of principles, in its support. To all these I spoke, and I\r\nhad the pleasure of seeing that my wishes were likely in a short time to\r\nbe gratified in both these cases.\r\n\r\nIt was now necessary that I should write to the committee in London. I\r\nhad written to them only two letters during my absence; for I had\r\ndevoted myself so much to the great object I had undertaken, that I\r\ncould think of little else. Hence some of my friends among them were\r\nobliged to write to different persons at Bristol, to inquire if I was\r\nalive, I gave up a day or two therefore, to this purpose. I informed the\r\ncommittee of all my discoveries in the various branches to which my\r\nattention had been directed, and desired them in return to procure me\r\nvarious official documents for the port of London, which I then\r\nspecified. Having done this, I conferred with Mr. Falconbridge, relative\r\nto being with me at Liverpool. I thought it right to make him no other\r\noffer than that his expenses should be paid. He acceded to my request on\r\nthese disinterested terms; and I took my departure from Bristol, leaving\r\nhim to follow me in a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nAuthor secures the Gloucester paper, and lays the foundation of a\r\npetition from that city; does the same at Worcester, and at\r\nChester.--Arrives at Liverpool.--Collects specimens of African\r\nproduce; also imports and exports, and muster-rolls, and accounts of\r\ndock duties, and iron instruments used in the Slave Trade.--His\r\nintroduction to Mr. Norris, and others.--Author and his errand become\r\nknown.--People visit him out of curiosity.--Frequent controversies on\r\nthe subject of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Gloucester, I waited upon my friend Dean Tucker. He was\r\npleased to hear of the great progress I had made since he left me. On\r\ncommunicating to him my intention of making interest with the editors of\r\nsome provincial papers, to enlighten the public mind, and with the\r\ninhabitants of some respectable places, for petitions to Parliament,\r\nrelative to the abolition of the Slave Trade, he approved of it, and\r\nintroduced me to Mr. Raikes, the proprietor of the respectable paper\r\nbelonging to that city. Mr. Raikes acknowledged, without any hesitation,\r\nthe pleasure he should have in serving such a noble cause; and he\r\npromised to grant me, from time to time, a corner in his paper, for such\r\nthings as I might point out to him for insertion. This promise he\r\nperformed afterwards, without any pecuniary consideration, and solely on\r\nthe ground of benevolence. He promised also his assistance as to the\r\nother object, for the promotion of which I left him several of my\r\n_Summary View_ to distribute.\r\n\r\nAt Worcester I trod over the same ground, and with the same success.\r\nTimothy Bevington, of the religious society of the Quakers, was the only\r\nperson to whom I had an introduction there: he accompanied me to the\r\nmayor, to the editor of the Worcester paper, and to several others,\r\nbefore each of whom I pleaded the cause of the oppressed Africans in the\r\nbest manner I was able. I dilated both on the inhumanity and on the\r\nimpolicy of the trade, which I supported by the various facts recently\r\nobtained at Bristol. I desired, however, as far as petitions were\r\nconcerned, (and this desire I expressed on all other similar occasions,)\r\nthat no attempt should be made to obtain these, till such information\r\nhad been circulated on the subject, that every one, when called upon,\r\nmight judge, from his knowledge of it, how far he would feel it right to\r\njoin in it. For this purpose I left also here several of my _Summary\r\nView_ for distribution.\r\n\r\nAfter my arrival at Chester, I went to the bishop's residence, but I\r\nfound he was not there. Knowing no other person in the place, I wrote a\r\nnote to Mr. Cowdroy, whom I understood to be the editor of the Chester\r\npaper, soliciting an interview with him, I explained my wishes to him on\r\nboth subjects. He seemed to be greatly rejoiced, when we met, that such\r\na measure as that of the abolition of the Slave Trade was in\r\ncontemplation. Living at so short a distance from Liverpool, and in a\r\ncountry from which so many persons were constantly going to Africa, he\r\nwas by no means ignorant, as some were, of the nature of this cruel\r\ntraffic; but yet he had no notion that I had probed it so deeply, or\r\nthat I had brought to light such important circumstances concerning it,\r\nas he found by my conversation. He made me a hearty offer of his\r\nservices on this occasion, and this expressly without fee or reward. I\r\naccepted them most joyfully and gratefully. It was, indeed, a most\r\nimportant thing, to have a station so near the enemy's camp, where we\r\ncould watch their motions, and meet any attack which might be made from\r\nit. And this office of a sentinel Mr. Cowdroy performed with great\r\nvigilance; and when he afterwards left Chester for Manchester, to\r\nestablish a paper there, he carried with him the same friendly\r\ndisposition towards our cause.\r\n\r\nMy first introduction at Liverpool was to William Rathbone, a member of\r\nthe religious society of the Quakers. He was the same person who, before\r\nthe formation of our committee, had procured me copies of several of the\r\nmuster-rolls of the slave-vessels belonging to that port, so that,\r\nthough we were not personally known, yet we were not strangers to each\r\nother. Isaac Hadwen, a respectable member of the same society, was the\r\nperson whom I saw next. I had been introduced to him, previously to my\r\njourney, when he was at London, at the yearly meeting of the Quakers, so\r\nthat no letter to him was necessary. As Mr. Roscoe had generally given\r\nthe profits of _The Wrongs of Africa_ to our committee, I made no\r\nscruple of calling upon him. His reception of me was very friendly, and\r\nhe introduced me afterwards to Dr. Currie, who had written the preface\r\nto that poem. There was also a fourth upon whom I called, though I did\r\nnot know him. His name was Edward Rushton: he had been an officer in a\r\nslave-ship, but had lost his sight, and had become an enemy to that\r\ntrade. On passing through Chester, I had heard, for the first time, that\r\nhe had published a poem called _West Indian Eclogues_, with a view of\r\nmaking the public better acquainted with the evil of the Slave Trade,\r\nand of exciting their indignation against it. Of the three last it may\r\nbe observed, that, having come forward thus early, as labourers, they\r\ndeserve to be put down, as I have placed them in the map, among the\r\nforerunners and coadjutors in this great cause, for each published his\r\nwork before any efforts were made publicly, or without knowing that any\r\nwere intended. Rushton, also, had the boldness, though then living in\r\nLiverpool, to affix his name to his work. These were the only persons\r\nwhom I knew for some time after my arrival in that place.\r\n\r\nIt may not, perhaps, be necessary to enter so largely into my\r\nproceedings at Liverpool as at Bristol. The following account,\r\ntherefore, may suffice:--\r\n\r\nIn my attempts to add to my collection of specimens of African produce,\r\nI was favoured with a sample of gum ruber astringents, of cotton from\r\nthe Gambia, of indigo and musk, of long pepper, of black pepper from\r\nWhidàh, of mahogany from Calabar, and of cloths of different colours,\r\nmade by the natives, which, while they gave other proofs of the quality\r\nof their own cotton, gave proofs, also, of the variety of their dyes.\r\n\r\nI made interest at the Custom-house for various exports and imports, and\r\nfor copies of the muster-rolls of several slave-vessels, besides those\r\nof vessels employed in other trades.\r\n\r\nBy looking out constantly for information on this great subject, I was\r\nled to the examination of a printed card or table of the dock duties of\r\nLiverpool, which was published annually. The town of Liverpool had so\r\nrisen in opulence and importance from only a fishing-village, that the\r\ncorporation seemed to have a pride in giving a public view of this\r\nincrease. Hence they published and circulated this card. Now the card\r\ncontained one, among other facts, which was almost as precious, in a\r\npolitical point of view, as any I had yet obtained. It stated that in\r\nthe year 1772, when I knew that a hundred vessels sailed out of\r\nLiverpool for the coast of Africa, the dock-duties amounted to 4552_l._,\r\nand that in 1779, when I knew that, in consequence of the war, only\r\neleven went from thence to the same coast, they amounted to 4957_l_.\r\nFrom these facts put together, two conclusions were obvious. The first\r\nwas, that the opulence of Liverpool, as far as the entry of vessels into\r\nits ports, and the dock-duties arising from thence, were concerned, was\r\nnot indebted to the Slave Trade; for these duties were highest when it\r\nhad only eleven ships in that employ. The second was, that there had\r\nbeen almost a practical experiment with respect to the abolition of it;\r\nfor the vessels in it had been gradually reduced from one hundred to\r\neleven, and yet the West Indians had not complained of their ruin, nor\r\nhad the merchants or manufacturers suffered, nor had Liverpool been\r\naffected by the change.\r\n\r\nThere were specimens of articles in Liverpool, which I entirely\r\noverlooked at Bristol, and which I believed I should have overlooked\r\nhere also, had it not been for seeing them at a window in a shop; I mean\r\nthose of different iron instruments used in this cruel traffic. I bought\r\na pair of the iron hand-cuffs with which the men-slaves are confined.\r\nThe right-hand wrist of one, and the left of another, are almost brought\r\ninto contact by these, and fastened together, as the figure A in the\r\nannexed plate represents, by a little bolt with a small padlock at the\r\nend of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handcuffs]\r\n\r\nI bought also a pair of shackles for the legs. These are represented by\r\nthe figure B.\r\n\r\nThe right ancle of one man is fastened to the left of another, as the\r\nreader will observe, by similar means. I bought these, not because it\r\nwas difficult to conceive how the unhappy victims of this execrable\r\ntrade were confined, but to show the fact that they were so. For what\r\nwas the inference from it, but that they did not leave their own country\r\nwillingly; that, when they were in the holds of the slave-vessels, they\r\nwere not in the Elysium which had been represented; and that there was a\r\nfear either that they would make their escape, or punish their\r\noppressors?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shackles for the legs]\r\n\r\nI bought also a thumb-screw at this shop. The thumbs are put into this\r\ninstrument through the two circular holes at the top of it. By turning a\r\nkey, a bar rises up by means of a screw from C to D, and the pressure\r\nupon them becomes painful. By turning it further you may make the blood\r\nstart from the ends of them. By taking the key away, as at E, you leave\r\nthe tortured person in agony, without any means of extricating himself,\r\nor of being extricated by others. This screw, as I was then informed,\r\nwas applied by way of punishment, in case of obstinacy in the slaves, or\r\nfor any other reputed offence, at the discretion of the captain.\r\n\r\nAt the same place I bought another instrument which I saw. It was called\r\na speculum oris. The dotted lines in the figure on the right hand of the\r\nscrew represent it when shut, the black lines when open. It is opened,\r\nas at G H, by a screw below with a nob at the end of it. This instrument\r\nis known among surgeons, having been invented to assist them in\r\nwrenching open the mouth as in the case of a locked jaw; but it had got\r\ninto use in this trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thumb screw]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Speculum oris]\r\n\r\nOn asking the seller of the instruments on what occasion it was used\r\nthere, he replied that the slaves were frequently so sulky as to shut\r\ntheir mouths against all sustenance, and this with a determination to\r\ndie; and that it was necessary their mouths should be forced open to\r\nthrow in nutriment, that they who had purchased them might incur no loss\r\nby their death.\r\n\r\nThe town-talk of Liverpool was much of the same nature as that at\r\nBristol on the subject of this trade. Horrible facts concerning it were\r\nin everybody's mouth; but they were more numerous, as was likely to be\r\nthe case where eighty vessels were employed from one port, and only\r\neighteen from the other. The people, too, at Liverpool seemed to be more\r\nhardened, or they related them with more coldness or less feeling. This\r\nmay be accounted for from the greater number of those facts, as just\r\nrelated, the mention of which, as it was of course more frequent,\r\noccasioned them to lose their power of exciting surprise. All this I\r\nthought in my favour, as I should more easily, or with less\r\nobnoxiousness, come to the knowledge of what I wanted to obtain.\r\n\r\nMy friend William Rathbone, who had been looking out to supply me with\r\nintelligence, but who was desirous that I should not be imposed upon,\r\nand that I should get it from the fountainhead, introduced me to Mr.\r\nNorris for this purpose. Norris had been formerly a slave-captain, but\r\nhad quitted the trade, and settled as a merchant in a different line of\r\nbusiness. He was a man of quick penetration, and of good talents, which\r\nhe had cultivated to advantage, and he had a pleasing address both as to\r\nspeech and manners. He received me with great politeness, and offered me\r\nall the information I desired. I was with him five or six times at his\r\nown house for this purpose. The substance of his communications on these\r\noccasions I shall now put down, and I beg the reader's particular\r\nattention to it, as he will be referred to it in other parts of this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the produce of Africa, Mr. Norris enumerated many\r\narticles in which a new and valuable trade might be opened, of which he\r\ngave me one, namely, the black pepper from Whidàh before mentioned. This\r\nhe gave me, to use his own expressions, as one argument among many\r\nothers of the impolicy of the Slave Trade, which, by turning the\r\nattention of the inhabitants to the persons of one another for sale,\r\nhindered foreigners from discovering, and themselves from cultivating,\r\nmany of the valuable productions of their own soil.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of procuring slaves, he gave it as his decided opinion\r\nthat many of the inhabitants of Africa were kidnapped by each other, as\r\nthey were travelling on the roads, or fishing in the creeks, or\r\ncultivating their little spots. Having learned their language, he had\r\ncollected the fact from various quarters, but more particularly from the\r\naccounts of slaves whom he had transported in his own vessels. With\r\nrespect, however, to Whidàh, many came from thence who were reduced to\r\nslavery in a different manner. The king of Dahomey, whose life (with the\r\nwars and customs of the Dahomans) he said he was then writing, and who\r\nwas a very despotic prince, made no scruple of seizing his own subjects,\r\nand of selling them, if he was in want of any of the articles which the\r\nslave-vessels would afford him. The history of this prince's life he\r\nlent me afterwards to read, while it was yet in manuscript, in which I\r\nobserved that he had recorded all the facts now mentioned. Indeed he\r\nmade no hesitation to state them, either when we were by ourselves, or\r\nwhen others were in company with us. He repeated them at one time in the\r\npresence both of Mr. Cruden and Mr. Coupland. The latter was then a\r\nslave-merchant at Liverpool. He seemed to be fired at the relation of\r\nthese circumstances. Unable to restrain himself longer, he entered into\r\na defence of the trade, both as to the humanity and the policy of it;\r\nbut Mr. Norris took up his arguments in both these cases, and answered\r\nthem in a solid manner.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Slave Trade as it affected the health of our seamen,\r\nMr. Norris admitted it to be destructive; but I did not stand in need of\r\nthis information, as I knew this part of the subject, in consequence of\r\nmy familiarity with the muster-rolls, better than himself.\r\n\r\nHe admitted it also to be true, that they were too frequently\r\nill-treated in this trade. A day or two after our conversation on this\r\nlatter subject he brought me the manuscript journal of a voyage to\r\nAfrica, which had been kept by a mate, with whom he was then acquainted.\r\nHe brought it to me to read, as it might throw some light upon the\r\nsubject on which we had talked last. In this manuscript various\r\ninstances of cruel usage towards seamen were put down, from which it\r\nappeared that the mate, who wrote it, had not escaped himself.\r\n\r\nAt the last interview we had, he seemed to be so satisfied of the\r\ninhumanity, injustice, and impolicy of the trade, that he made me a\r\nvoluntary offer of certain clauses, which he had been thinking of, and\r\nwhich, he believed, if put into an Act of Parliament, would judiciously\r\neffect its abolition. The offer of these clauses I embraced eagerly. He\r\ndictated them, and I wrote. I wrote them in a small book which I had\r\nthen in my pocket. They were these:--\r\n\r\nNo vessel, under a heavy penalty, to supply foreigners with slaves.\r\n\r\nEvery vessel to pay to government a tax for a register on clearing out\r\nto supply our own islands with slaves.\r\n\r\nEvery such vessel to be prohibited from purchasing or bringing home any\r\nof the productions of Africa.\r\n\r\nEvery such vessel to be prohibited from bringing home a passenger, or\r\nany article of produce, from the West Indies.\r\n\r\nA bounty to be given to every vessel trading in the natural productions\r\nof Africa. This bounty to be paid in part out of the tax arising from\r\nthe registers of the slave-vessels.\r\n\r\nCertain establishments to be made by government in Africa, in the\r\nBananas, in the Isles de Los, on the banks of the Camaranca, and in\r\nother places, for the encouragement and support of the new trade to be\r\nsubstituted there.\r\n\r\nSuch then were the services, which Mr. Norris, at the request of William\r\nRathbone, rendered me at Liverpool, during my stay there; and I have\r\nbeen very particular in detailing them, because I shall be obliged to\r\nallude to them, as I have before observed, on some important occasions\r\nin a future part of the work.\r\n\r\nOn going my rounds one day, I met accidentally with Captain Chaffers.\r\nThis gentleman either was or had been in the West India employ. His\r\nheart had beaten in sympathy with mine, and he had greatly favoured our\r\ncause. He had seen me at Mr. Norris's, and learned my errand there. He\r\ntold me he could introduce me in a few minutes, as we were then near at\r\nhand, to Captain Lace, if I chose it. Captain Lace, he said, had been\r\nlong in the Slave Trade, and could give me very accurate information\r\nabout it. I accepted his offer. On talking to Captain Lace, relative to\r\nthe productions of Africa, he told me that mahogany grew at Calabar. He\r\nbegan to describe a tree of that kind, which he had seen there. This\r\ntree was from about eighteen inches to two feet in diameter, and about\r\nsixty feet high, or, as he expressed it, of the height of a tall\r\nchimney. As soon as he mentioned Calabar, a kind of horror came over me.\r\nHis name became directly associated in my mind with the place. It almost\r\ninstantly occurred to me, that he commanded the Edgar out of Liverpool,\r\nwhen the dreadful massacre there, as has been related, took place.\r\nIndeed I seemed to be so confident of it, that, attending more to my\r\nfeelings than to my reason at this moment, I accused him with being\r\nconcerned in it. This produced great confusion among us. For he looked\r\nincensed at Captain Chaffers, as if he had introduced me to him for this\r\npurpose. Captain Chaffers again seemed to be all astonishment that I\r\nshould have known of this circumstance, and to be vexed that I should\r\nhave mentioned it in such a manner. I was also in a state of trembling\r\nmyself. Captain Lace could only say it was a bad business. But he never\r\ndefended himself, nor those concerned in it. And we soon parted, to the\r\ngreat joy of us all.\r\n\r\nSoon after this interview, I began to perceive that I was known in\r\nLiverpool, as well as the object for which I came. Mr. Coupland, the\r\nslave-merchant, with whom I had disputed at Mr. Norris's house, had\r\ngiven the alarm to those who were concerned in the trade, and Captain\r\nLace, as may be now easily imagined, had spread it. This knowledge of me\r\nand of my errand was almost immediately productive of two effects, the\r\nfirst of which I shall now mention.\r\n\r\nI had a private room at the King's Arms tavern, besides my bed-room,\r\nwhere I used to meditate and to write; but I generally dined in public.\r\nThe company at dinner had hitherto varied but little as to number, and\r\nconsisted of those, both from the town and country, who had been\r\naccustomed to keep up a connexion with the house. But now things were\r\naltered, and many people came to dine there daily with a view of seeing\r\nme, as if I had been some curious creature imported from foreign parts.\r\nThey thought, also, they could thus have an opportunity of conversing\r\nwith me. Slave-merchants and slave-captains came in among others for\r\nthis purpose. I had observed this difference in the number of our\r\ncompany for two or three days. Dale, the master of the tavern, had\r\nobserved it also, and told me in a good-natured manner, that many of\r\nthese were my visitors, and that I was likely to bring him a great deal\r\nof custom. In a little time, however, things became serious; for they,\r\nwho came to see me, always started the abolition of the Slave Trade as\r\nthe subject for conversation. Many entered into the justification of\r\nthis trade with great warmth, as if to ruffle my temper, or at any rate\r\nto provoke me to talk. Others threw out, with the same view, that men\r\nwere going about to abolish it, who would have done much better if they\r\nhad stayed at home. Others said they had heard of a person turned mad,\r\nwho had conceived the thought of destroying Liverpool, and all its\r\nglory. Some gave as a toast, Success to the trade, and then laughed\r\nimmoderately, and watched me when I took my glass to see if I would\r\ndrink it. I saw the way in which things were now going, and I believed\r\nit would be proper that I should come to some fixed resolutions; such\r\nas, whether I should change my lodgings, and whether I should dine in\r\nprivate; and if not, what line of conduct it would become me to pursue\r\non such occasions. With respect to changing my lodgings and dining in\r\nprivate, I conceived, if I were to do either of these things, that I\r\nshould be showing an unmanly fear of my visiters, which they would turn\r\nto their own advantage. I conceived too, that, if I chose to go on as\r\nbefore, and to enter into conversation with them on the subject of the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade, I might be able, by having such an\r\nassemblage of persons daily, to gather all the arguments which they\r\ncould collect on the other side of our question, an advantage which I\r\nshould one day feel in the future management of the cause. With respect\r\nto the line, which I should pursue in the case of remaining in the place\r\nof my abode and in my former habits, I determined never to start the\r\nsubject of the abolition myself--never to abandon it when started--never\r\nto defend it but in a serious and dignified manner--and never to\r\ndiscover any signs of irritation, whatever provocation might be given\r\nme. By this determination I abided rigidly. The King's Arms became now\r\ndaily the place for discussion on this subject. Many tried to insult me,\r\nbut to no purpose. In all these discussions I found the great advantage\r\nof having brought Mr. Falconbridge with me from Bristol; for he was\r\nalways at the table; and when my opponents, with a disdainful look,\r\ntried to ridicule my knowledge, among those present, by asking me if I\r\nhad ever been on the coast of Africa myself, he used generally to reply,\r\n\"But I have. I know all your proceedings there, and that his statements\r\nare true.\" These and other words put in by him, who was an athletic and\r\nresolute-looking man, were of great service to me. All disinterested\r\npersons, of whom there were four or five daily in the room, were\r\nuniformly convinced by our arguments, and took our part, and some of\r\nthem very warmly. Day after day we beat our opponents out of the field,\r\nas many of the company acknowledged, to their no small notification, in\r\ntheir presence. Thus, while we served the cause by discovering all that\r\ncould be said against it, we served it by giving numerous individuals\r\nproper ideas concerning it, and of interesting them in our favour.\r\n\r\nThe second effect which I experienced was, that from this time I could\r\nnever get any one to come forward as an evidence to serve the cause.\r\nThere were, I believe, hundreds of persons in Liverpool, and in the\r\nneighbourhood of it, who had been concerned in this traffic, and who had\r\nleft it, all of whom could have given such testimony concerning it as\r\nwould have insured its abolition. But none of them would now speak out.\r\nOf these, indeed, there were some, who were alive to the horrors of it,\r\nand who lamented that it should still continue. But yet even these were\r\nbackward in supporting me. All that they did was just privately to see\r\nme, to tell me that I was right, and to exhort me to persevere: but as\r\nto coming forward to be examined publicly, my object was so unpopular,\r\nand would become so much more so when brought into parliament, that they\r\nwould have their houses pulled down, if they should then appear as\r\npublic instruments in the annihilation of the trade. With this account I\r\nwas obliged to rest satisfied; nor could I deny, when I considered the\r\nspirit, which had manifested itself, and the extraordinary number of\r\ninterested persons in the place, that they had some reason for their\r\nfears; and that these fears were not groundless, appeared afterwards;\r\nfor Dr. Binns, a respectable physician belonging to the religious\r\nsociety of the Quakers, and to whom Isaac Hadwen had introduced me, was\r\nnear falling into a mischievous plot, which had been laid against him,\r\nbecause he was one of the subscribers to the institution for the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade, and because he was suspected of having\r\naided me in promoting that object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nHostile disposition towards the author increases, on account of his\r\nknown patronage of the seamen employed in the Slave Trade; manner of\r\nprocuring and paying them at Liverpool; their treatment and\r\nmortality.--Account of the murder of Peter Green; trouble taken by the\r\nauthor to trace it; his narrow escape.--Goes to Lancaster, but returns\r\nto Liverpool; leaves the latter place.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has appeared that a number of persons used to come and see me, out of\r\ncuriosity, at the King's Arms tavern; and that these manifested a bad\r\ndisposition towards me, which was near breaking out into open insult.\r\nNow the cause of all this was, as I have observed, the knowledge which\r\npeople had obtained relative to my errand at this place. But this\r\nhostile disposition was increased by another circumstance, which I am\r\nnow to mention. I had been so shocked at the treatment of the seamen\r\nbelonging to the slave-vessels at Bristol, that I determined, on my\r\narrival at Liverpool, to institute an inquiry concerning it there also.\r\nI had made considerable progress in it, so that few seamen were landed\r\nfrom such vessels, but I had some communication with them; and though no\r\none else would come near me, to give me any information about the trade,\r\nthese were always forward to speak to me, and to tell me their\r\ngrievances, if it were only with the hope of being able to get redress.\r\nThe consequence of this was, that they used to come to the King's Arms\r\ntavern to see me. Hence, one, two, and three, were almost daily to be\r\nfound about the door; and this happened quite as frequently after the\r\nhostility just mentioned had shown itself, as before. They, therefore,\r\nwho came to visit me out of curiosity, could not help seeing my sailor\r\nvisiters; and on inquiring into their errand, they became more than ever\r\nincensed against me.\r\n\r\nThe first result of this increased hostility towards me was an\r\napplication from some of them to the master of the tavern, that he would\r\nnot harbour me. This he communicated to me in a friendly manner, but he\r\nwas by no means desirous that I should leave him. On the other hand, he\r\nhoped I would stay long enough to accomplish my object. I thought it\r\nright, however, to take the matter into consideration; and having\r\ncanvassed it, I resolved to remain with him, for the reasons mentioned\r\nin the former chapter. But, that I might avoid doing anything that would\r\nbe injurious to his interest, as well as in some measure avoid giving\r\nunnecessary offence to others, I took lodgings in Williamson Square,\r\nwhere I retired to write, and occasionally to sleep, and to which place\r\nall seamen, desirous of seeing me, were referred. Hence I continued to\r\nget the same information as before, but in a less obnoxious and\r\ninjurious manner.\r\n\r\nThe history of the seamen employed in the slave-vessels belonging to the\r\nport of Liverpool, I found to be similar to that of those from Bristol.\r\n\r\nThey who went into this trade were of two classes. The first consisted\r\nof those who were ignorant of it, and to whom generally improper\r\nrepresentations of advantage had been made, for the purpose of enticing\r\nthem into it. The second consisted of those who, by means of a regular\r\nsystem, kept up by the mates and captains, had been purposely brought by\r\ntheir landlords into distress, from which they could only be extricated\r\nby going into this hateful employ. How many have I seen, with tears in\r\ntheir eyes, put into boats, and conveyed to vessels, which were then\r\nlying at the Black Rock, and which were only waiting to receive them to\r\nsail away!\r\n\r\nThe manner of paying them in the currency of the islands was the same as\r\nat Bristol. But this practice was not concealed at Liverpool, as it was\r\nat the former place. The articles of agreement were printed, so that all\r\nwho chose to buy might read them. At the same time it must be observed,\r\nthat seamen were never paid in this manner in any other employ; and that\r\nthe African wages, though nominally higher for the sake of procuring\r\nhands, were thus made to be actually lower than in other trades.\r\n\r\nThe loss by death was so similar, that it did not signify whether the\r\ncalculation on a given number was made either at this or the other port.\r\nI had, however, a better opportunity at this than I had at the other, of\r\nknowing the loss, as it related to those whose constitutions had been\r\nruined, or who had been rendered incapable by disease, of continuing\r\ntheir occupation at sea. For the slave-vessels which returned to\r\nLiverpool, sailed immediately into the docks, so that I saw at once\r\ntheir sickly and ulcerated crews. The number of vessels, too, was so\r\nmuch greater from this, than from any other port, that their sick made a\r\nmore conspicuous figure in the infirmary; and they were seen also more\r\nfrequently in the streets.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their treatment, nothing could be worse. It seemed to me\r\nto be but one barbarous system from the beginning to the end. I do not\r\nsay barbarous, as if premeditated, but it became so in consequence of\r\nthe savage habits gradually formed by a familiarity with miserable\r\nsights, and with a course of action inseparable from the trade. Men in\r\ntheir first voyages usually disliked the traffic; and if they were happy\r\nenough then to abandon it, they usually escaped the disease of a\r\nhardened heart. But if they went a second and a third time, their\r\ndisposition became gradually changed. It was impossible for them to be\r\naccustomed to carry away men and women by force, to keep them in chains,\r\nto see their tears, to hear their mournful lamentations, to behold the\r\ndead and the dying, to be obliged to keep up a system of severity amidst\r\nall this affliction,--in short, it was impossible for them to be\r\nwitnesses, and this for successive voyages, to the complicated mass of\r\nmisery passing in a slave-ship, without losing their finer feelings, or\r\nwithout contracting those habits of moroseness and cruelty which would\r\nbrutalize their nature. Now, if we consider that persons could not\r\neasily become captains (and to these the barbarities were generally\r\nchargeable by actual perpetration, or by consent) till they had been two\r\nor three voyages in this employ, we shall see the reason why it would be\r\nalmost a miracle, if they, who were thus employed in it, were not rather\r\nto become monsters, than to continue to be men.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Bristol, I heard from an officer of the Alfred, who gave\r\nme the intelligence privately, that the steward of a Liverpool ship,\r\nwhose name was Green, had been murdered in that ship. The Alfred was in\r\nBonny river at the same time, and his own captain, (so infamous for his\r\ncruelty, as has been before shown,) was on board when it happened. The\r\ncircumstances, he said, belonging to this murder, were, if report were\r\ntrue, of a most atrocious nature, and deserved to be made the subject of\r\ninquiry. As to the murder itself, he observed, it had passed as a\r\nnotorious and uncontradicted fact.\r\n\r\nThis account was given me just as I had made an acquaintance with Mr.\r\nFalconbridge, and I informed him of it; he said he had no doubt of its\r\ntruth; for in his last voyage he went to Bonny himself, where the ship\r\nwas then lying, in which the transaction happened: the king and several\r\nof the black traders told him of it. The report then current was simply\r\nthis, that the steward had been barbarously beaten one evening; that\r\nafter this he was let down with chains upon him into a boat, which was\r\nalongside of the ship, and that the next morning he was found dead.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Liverpool, I resolved to inquire into the truth of this\r\nreport. On looking into one of the wet docks, I saw the name of the\r\nvessel alluded to; I walked over the decks of several others, and got on\r\nboard her. Two people were walking up and down her, and one was leaning\r\nupon a rail by the side. I asked the latter how many slaves this ship\r\nhad carried in her last voyage; he replied he could not tell; but one of\r\nthe two persons walking about could answer me, as he had sailed out and\r\nreturned in her. This man came up to us, and joined in conversation. He\r\nanswered my questions and many others, and would have shown me the ship,\r\nbut on asking him how many seamen had died on the voyage, he changed his\r\nmanner, and said, with apparent hesitation, that he could not tell. I\r\nasked him next, what had become, of the steward Green. He said he\r\nbelieved he was dead. I asked how the seamen had been used. He said, not\r\nworse than others. I then asked whether Green had been used worse than\r\nothers. He replied, he did not then recollect. I found that he was now\r\nquite upon his guard, and as I could get no satisfactory answer from him\r\nI left the ship.\r\n\r\nOn the next day I looked over the muster-roll of this vessel; on\r\nexamining it, I found that sixteen of the crew had died; I found also\r\nthe name of Peter Green; I found, again, that the latter had been put\r\ndown among the dead. I observed, also, that the ship had left Liverpool\r\non the 5th of June, 1786, and had returned on the 5th of June, 1787, and\r\nthat Peter Green was put down as having died on the 19th of September;\r\nfrom all which circumstances it was evident that he must, as my Bristol\r\ninformant asserted, have died upon the Coast.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this extraordinary coincidence of name, mortality, time,\r\nand place, I could gain no further intelligence about the affair till\r\nwithin about ten days before I left Liverpool; when among the seamen,\r\nwho came to apply to me in Williamson Square was George Ormond. He came\r\nto inform me of his own ill-usage; from which circumstance I found that\r\nhe had sailed in the same ship with Peter Green. This led me to inquire\r\ninto the transaction in question, and I received from him the following\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nPeter Green had been shipped as steward. A black woman, of the name of\r\nRodney, went out in the same vessel; she belonged to the owners of it,\r\nand was to be an interpretess to the slaves who should be purchased.\r\nAbout five in the evening, some time in the month of September, the\r\nvessel then lying in Bonny river, the captain, as was his custom, went\r\non shore. In his absence, Rodney, the black woman, asked Green for the\r\nkeys of the pantry, which he refused her, alleging that the captain had\r\nalready beaten him for having given them to her on a former occasion,\r\nwhen she drank the wine. The woman, being passionate, struck him, and a\r\nscuffle ensued, out of which Green extricated himself as well as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nWhen the scuffle was over the woman retired to the cabin, and appeared\r\npensive. Between eight and nine in the evening, the captain, who was\r\nattended by the captain of the Alfred, came on board; Rodney immediately\r\nran to him, and informed him that Green had made an assault upon her.\r\nThe captain, without any inquiry, beat him severely, and ordered his\r\nhands to be made fast to some bolts on the starboard side of the ship\r\nand under the half deck, and then flogged him himself, using the lashes\r\nof the cat-of-nine-tails upon his back at one time, and the double\r\nwalled knot at the end of it upon his head at another; and stopping to\r\nrest at intervals, and using each hand alternately, that he might strike\r\nwith the greater severity.\r\n\r\nThe pain had now become so very severe, that Green cried out, and\r\nentreated the captain of the Alfred, who was standing by, to pity his\r\nhard case, and to intercede for him. But the latter replied, that he\r\nwould have served me in the same manner. Unable to find a friend here,\r\nhe called upon the chief mate; but this only made matters worse, for the\r\ncaptain then ordered the latter to flog him also; which he did for some\r\ntime, using however only the lashes of the instrument. Green then called\r\nin his distress upon the second mate to speak for him; but the second\r\nmate was immediately ordered to perform the same cruel office, and was\r\nmade to persevere in it till the lashes were all worn into threads. But\r\nthe barbarity did not close here; for the captain, on seeing the\r\ninstrument now become useless, ordered another, with which he flogged\r\nhim as before, beating him at times over the head with the double-walled\r\nknot, and changing his hands, and cursing his own left hand for not\r\nbeing able to strike so severe a blow as his right.\r\n\r\nThe punishment, as inflicted by all parties, had now lasted two hours\r\nand a half, when George Ormond was ordered to cut down one of the arms,\r\nand the boatswain the other, from the places of their confinement; this\r\nbeing done, Green lay motionless on the deck. He attempted to utter\r\nsomething, Ormond understood it to be the word water; but no water was\r\nallowed him. The captain, on the other hand, said he had not yet done\r\nwith him, and ordered him to be confined with his arms across, his right\r\nhand to his left foot, and his left hand to his right foot. For this\r\npurpose the carpenter brought shackles, and George Ormond was compelled\r\nto put them on. The captain then ordered some tackle to be made fast to\r\nthe limbs of the said Peter Green, in which situation he was then\r\nhoisted up, and afterwards let down into a boat, which was lying\r\nalongside the ship. Michael Cunningham was then sent to loose the\r\ntackle, and to leave him there.\r\n\r\nIn the middle watch, or between one and two next morning, George Ormond\r\nlooked out of one of the port-holes, and called to Green, but received\r\nno answer. Between two and three, Paul Berry, a seaman, was sent down\r\ninto the boat, and found him dead. He made his report to one of the\r\nofficers of the ship. About five in the morning the body was brought up,\r\nand laid on the waist near the half-deck door. The captain on seeing the\r\nbody when he rose, expressed no concern, but ordered it to be knocked\r\nout of irons, and to be buried at the usual place of interment for\r\nseamen, or Bonny Point. I may now observe, that the deceased was in good\r\nhealth before the punishment took place, and in high spirits; for he\r\nplayed upon the flute only a short time before Rodney asked him for the\r\nkeys, while those seamen, who were in health, danced.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this cruel relation from George Ormond, who was throughout a\r\nmaterial witness to the scene, I had no doubt in my own mind of the\r\ntruth of it; but I thought it right to tell him at once that I had seen\r\na person, about four weeks ago, who had been the same voyage with him\r\nand Peter Green, but yet who had no recollection of these circumstances.\r\nUpon this he looked quite astonished, and began to grow angry; he\r\nmaintained he had seen the whole; he had also held the candle himself\r\nduring the whole punishment. He asserted that one candle and half of\r\nanother were burnt out while it lasted. He said also that, while the\r\nbody lay in the waist, he had handled the abused parts, and had put\r\nthree of his fingers into a hole, made by the double walled knot, in the\r\nhead, from whence a quantity of blood and, he believed, brains issued.\r\nHe then challenged me to bring the man, before him; I desired him upon\r\nthis to be cool, and to come to me the next day, and I would then talk\r\nwith him again upon the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the interim I consulted the muster-roll of the vessel again; I found\r\nthe name of George Ormond; he had sailed in her out of Liverpool, and\r\nhad been discharged at the latter end of January in the West Indies, as\r\nhe had told me. I found also the names of Michael Cunningham and of Paul\r\nBerry, whom he had mentioned. It was obvious also that Ormond's account\r\nof the captain of the Alfred being on board at the time of the\r\npunishment tallied with that given me at Bristol by an officer of that\r\nvessel, and that his account of letting down Peter Green into the boat\r\ntallied with that which Mr. Falconbridge, as I mentioned before, had\r\nheard from the king and the black traders in Bonny river.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to me next day, he came in high spirits. He said he had\r\nfound out the man whom I had seen. The man, however, when he talked to\r\nhim about the murder of Peter Green, acknowledged every thing concerning\r\nit. Ormond intimated that this man was to sail again in the same ship\r\nunder the promise of being an officer, and that he had been kept on\r\nboard, and had been enticed to a second voyage, for no other purpose\r\nthan that he might be prevented from divulging the matter. I then asked\r\nOrmond, whether he thought the man would acknowledge the murder in my\r\nhearing. He replied, \"that, if I were present, he thought he would not\r\nsay much about it, as he was soon to be under the same captain, but that\r\nhe would not deny it. If, however, I were out of sight, though I might\r\nbe in hearing, he believed he would acknowledge the facts.\"\r\n\r\nBy the assistance of Mr. Falconbridge, I found a public-house, which had\r\ntwo rooms in it: nearly at the top of the partition between them was a\r\nsmall window, which a person might look through by standing upon a\r\nchair. I desired Ormond, one evening, to invite the man into the larger\r\nroom, in which he was to have a candle, and, to talk with him on the\r\nsubject. I proposed to station myself in the smallest in the dark, so\r\nthat by looking through the window I could both see and hear him, and\r\nyet be unperceived myself. The room, in which I was to be, was one where\r\nthe dead were frequently carried to be owned. We were all in our places\r\nat the time appointed. I directly discovered that it was the same man\r\nwith whom I had conversed on board the ship in the wet docks. I heard\r\nhim distinctly relate many of the particulars of the murder, and\r\nacknowledge them all. Ormond, after having talked with him some time,\r\nsaid, \"Well, then, you believe Peter Green was actually murdered?\" He\r\nreplied, \"If Peter Green was not murdered, no man ever was.\" What\r\nfollowed I do not know. I had heard quite enough; and the room was so\r\ndisagreeable in smell, that I did not choose to stay in it longer than\r\nwas absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nI own I was now quite satisfied that the murder had taken place, and my\r\nfirst thought was to bring the matter before the mayor, and to take up\r\nthree of the officers of the ship. But, in mentioning my intention to my\r\nfriends, I was dissuaded from it. They had no doubt but that in\r\nLiverpool, as there was now a notion that the Slave Trade would become a\r\nsubject of parliamentary inquiry, every, effort would be made to\r\noverthrow me. They were of opinion also that such of the magistrates, as\r\nwere interested in the trade, when applied to for warrants of\r\napprehension, would contrive to give notice to the officers to escape.\r\nIn addition to this they believed, that so many in the town were already\r\nincensed against me, that I should be torn to pieces, and the house\r\nwhere I lodged burnt down, if I were to make the attempt. I thought it\r\nright therefore to do nothing for the present; but I sent Ormond to\r\nLondon, to keep him out of the way of corruption, till I should make up\r\nmy mind as to further proceedings on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, if I observe the bounds I have prescribed myself, and\r\nI believe the reader will be glad of it on account of his own feelings,\r\nthat I should lay open the numerous cases, which came before me at\r\nLiverpool, relative to the ill-treatment of the seamen in this wicked\r\ntrade. It may be sufficient to say, that they harassed my constitution,\r\nand affected my spirits daily. They were in my thoughts on my pillow\r\nafter I retired to rest, and I found them before my eyes when I awoke.\r\nAfflicting, however, as they were, they were of great use in the\r\npromotion of our cause: for they served, whatever else failed, as a\r\nstimulus to perpetual energy: they made me think light of former\r\nlabours, and they urged me imperiously to new. And here I may observe,\r\nthat among the many circumstances which ought to excite our joy on\r\nconsidering the great event of the abolition of the Slave Trade, which\r\nhas now happily taken place, there are few for which we ought to be more\r\ngrateful, than that from this time our commerce ceases to breed such\r\nabandoned wretches: while those, who have thus been bred in it, and who\r\nmay yet find employment in other trades, will, in the common course of\r\nnature, be taken off in a given time, so that our marine will at length\r\nbe purified from a race of monsters, which have helped to cripple its\r\nstrength, and to disgrace its character.\r\n\r\nThe temper of many of the interested people of Liverpool had now become\r\nstill more irritable, and their hostility more apparent than before. I\r\nreceived anonymous letters, entreating me to leave it, or I should\r\notherwise never leave it alive. The only effect which this advice had\r\nupon me, was to make me more vigilant when I went out at night. I never\r\nstirred out at this time without Mr. Falconbridge; and he never\r\naccompanied me without being well armed. Of this, however, I knew\r\nnothing until we had left the place. There was certainly a time when I\r\nhad reason to believe that I had a narrow escape. I was one day on the\r\npier-head with many others looking at some little boats below at the\r\ntime of a heavy gale. Several persons, probably out of curiosity, were\r\nhastening thither. I had seen all I intended to see, and was departing,\r\nwhen I noticed eight or nine persons making towards me. I was then only\r\nabout eight or nine yards from the precipice of the pier, but going from\r\nit. I expected that they would have divided to let me through them;\r\ninstead of which they closed upon me and bore me back. I was borne\r\nwithin a yard of the precipice, when I discovered my danger; and\r\nperceiving among them the murderer of Peter Green, and two others who\r\nhad insulted me at the King's Arms, it instantly struck me that they had\r\na design to throw me over the pier-head; which they might have done at\r\nthis time, and yet have pleaded that I had been killed by accident.\r\nThere was not a moment to lose. Vigorous on account of the danger, I\r\ndarted forward. One of them, against whom I pushed myself, fell down:\r\ntheir ranks were broken; and I escaped, not without blows, amidst their\r\nimprecations and abuse.\r\n\r\nI determined now to go to Lancaster, to make some inquiries about the\r\nSlave Trade there. I had a letter of introduction to William Jepson, one\r\nof the religious society of the Quakers, for this purpose. I found from\r\nhim, that, though there were slave-merchants at Lancaster, they made\r\ntheir outfits at Liverpool, as a more convenient port. I learnt too from\r\nothers, that the captain of the last vessel, which had sailed out of\r\nLancaster to the coast of Africa for slaves, had taken off so many of\r\nthe natives treacherously, that any other vessel known to come from it\r\nwould be cut off. There were only now one or two superannuated captains\r\nliving in the place. Finding I could get no oral testimony, I was\r\nintroduced into the Custom-house. Here I just looked over the\r\nmuster-rolls of such slave-vessels as had formerly sailed from this\r\nport; and having found that the loss of seamen was precisely in the same\r\nproportion as elsewhere, I gave myself no further trouble, but left the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Liverpool, I was informed by Mr. Falconbridge, that a\r\nship-mate of Ormond, of the name of Patrick Murray, who had been\r\ndischarged in the West Indies, had arrived there. This man, he said, had\r\nbeen to call upon me in my absence, to seek redress for his own bad\r\nusage; but in the course of conversation he had confirmed all the\r\nparticulars as stated by Ormond, relative to the murder of Peter Green.\r\nOn consulting the muster-roll of the ship, I found his name, and that he\r\nhad been discharged in the West Indies on the 2nd of February. I\r\ndetermined, therefore, to see him. I cross-examined him in the best\r\nmanner I could. I could neither make him contradict himself, nor say\r\nanything that militated against the testimony of Ormond. I was\r\nconvinced, therefore, of the truth of the transaction; and, having\r\nobtained his consent, I sent him to London to stay with the latter, till\r\nhe should hear further from me. I learnt also from Mr. Falconbridge,\r\nthat visitors had continued to come to the King's Arms during my\r\nabsence; that they had been very liberal of their abuse of me; and that\r\none of them did not hesitate to say (which is remarkable) that \"I\r\ndeserved to be thrown over the pierhead.\"\r\n\r\nFinding now that I could get no further evidence; that the information\r\nwhich I had already obtained was considerable[A]; and that the committee\r\nhad expressed an earnest desire, in a letter which I had received, that\r\nI would take into consideration the propriety of writing my Essay on the\r\n_Impolicy of the Slave Trade_ as soon as possible, I determined upon\r\nleaving Liverpool.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: In London, Bristol, and Liverpool, I had already obtained\r\nthe names of more than 20,000 seamen, in different voyages, knowing what\r\nhad become of each.]\r\n\r\nI went round accordingly and took leave of my friends. The last of these\r\nwas William Rathbone, and I have to regret, that it was also the last\r\ntime I ever saw him. Independently of the gratitude I owed him for\r\nassisting me in this great cause, I respected him highly as a man: he\r\npossessed a fine understanding with a solid judgment: he was a person of\r\nextraordinary simplicity of manners. Though he lived in a state of\r\npecuniary independence, he gave an example of great temperance, as well\r\nas of great humility of mind: but however humble he appeared, he had\r\nalways the courage to dare to do that which was right, however it might\r\nresist the customs or the prejudices of men. In his own line of trade,\r\nwhich was that of a timber-merchant on an extensive scale, he would not\r\nallow any article to be sold for the use of a slave-ship, and he always\r\nrefused those, who applied to him for materials for such purposes. But\r\nit is evident that it was his intention, if he had lived, to bear his\r\ntestimony still more publicly upon this subject; for an advertisement,\r\nstating the ground of his refusal to furnish anything for this traffic\r\nupon Christian principles, with a memorandum for two advertisements in\r\nthe Liverpool papers, was found among his papers at his decease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nAuthor proceeds to Manchester; finds a spirit rising among the people\r\nthere for the abolition of the Slave Trade; is requested to deliver a\r\ndiscourse on the subject of the Slave Trade; heads of it, and\r\nextracts.--Proceeds to Keddleston, and Birmingham; finds a similar\r\nspirit at the latter place.--Revisits Bristol; new and difficult\r\nsituation there.--Author crosses the Severn at night; unsuccessful\r\ntermination of his journey; returns to London.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now took my departure from Liverpool, and proceeded to Manchester,\r\nwhere I arrived on the Friday evening. On the Saturday morning, Mr.\r\nThomas Walker, attended by Mr. Cooper and Mr. Bayley of Hope, called\r\nupon me. They were then strangers to me. They came, they said, having\r\nheard of my arrival, to congratulate me on the spirit which was then\r\nbeginning to show itself among the people of Manchester, and of other\r\nplaces, on the subject of the Slave Trade, and which would\r\nunquestionably manifest itself further by breaking out into petitions to\r\nparliament for its abolition. I was much surprised at this information.\r\nI had devoted myself so entirely to my object, that I had never had time\r\nto read a newspaper since I left London. I never knew, therefore, till\r\nnow, that the attention of the public had been drawn to the subject in\r\nsuch a manner. And as to petitions, though I myself had suggested the\r\nidea at Bridgewater, Bristol, Gloucester, and two, or three other\r\nplaces, I had only done it provisionally, and this without either the\r\nknowledge or the consent of the committee. The news, however, as it\r\nastonished, so it almost overpowered me with joy. I rejoiced in it,\r\nbecause it was a proof of the general good disposition of my countrymen;\r\nbecause it showed me that the cause was such as needed only to be known,\r\nto be patronized; and because the manifestation of this spirit seemed to\r\nme to be an earnest, that success would ultimately follow.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman now mentioned took me away with them, and introduced me to\r\nMr. Thomas Phillips. We conversed, at first, upon the discoveries made\r\nin my journey; but in a little time, understanding that I had been\r\neducated as a clergyman, they came upon me with one voice, as if it had\r\nbeen before agreed upon, to deliver a discourse the next day, which was\r\nSunday, on the subject of the Slave Trade. I was always aware that it\r\nwas my duty to do all that I could with propriety to serve the cause I\r\nhad undertaken, and yet I found myself embarrassed at their request.\r\nForeseeing, as I have before related, that this cause might demand my\r\nattention to it for the greatest part of my life, I had given up all\r\nthoughts of my profession. I had hitherto but seldom exercised it, and\r\nthen only to oblige some friend. I doubted, too, at the first view of\r\nthe thing, whether the pulpit ought to be made an engine for political\r\npurposes, though I could not but consider the Slave Trade as a mass of\r\ncrimes, and therefore the effort to get rid of it as a Christian duty. I\r\nhad an idea, too, that sacred matters should not be entered upon without\r\ndue consideration, nor prosecuted in a hasty, but in a decorous and\r\nsolemn manner. I saw besides that, as it was then two o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, and this sermon was to be forthcoming the next day, there was\r\nnot sufficient time to compose it properly. All these difficulties I\r\nsuggested to my new friends without any reserve. But nothing that I\r\ncould urge would satisfy them. They would not hear of a refusal, and I\r\nwas obliged to give my consent, though I was not reconciled to the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nWhen I went into the church it was so full that I could scarcely get to\r\nmy place; for notice had been publicly given, though I knew nothing of\r\nit, that such a discourse would be delivered. I was surprised, also, to\r\nfind a great crowd of black people standing round the pulpit. There\r\nmight be forty or fifty of them. The text that I took, as the best to be\r\nfound in such a hurry, was the following:--\"Thou shalt not oppress a\r\nstranger, for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers\r\nin the land of Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nI took an opportunity of showing, from these words, that Moses, in\r\nendeavouring to promote among the children of Israel a tender\r\ndisposition towards those unfortunate strangers who had come under their\r\ndominion, reminded them of their own state when strangers in Egypt, as\r\none of the most forcible arguments which could be used on such an\r\noccasion. For they could not have forgotten that the Egyptians \"had made\r\nthem serve with rigour; that they had made their lives bitter with hard\r\nbondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the\r\nfield; and that all the service, wherein they made them serve, was with\r\nrigour.\" The argument, therefore, of Moses was simply this:--\"Ye knew\r\nwell, when ye were strangers in Egypt, the nature of your own feelings.\r\nWere you not made miserable by your debased situation there? But if so,\r\nyou must be sensible that the stranger, who has the same heart, or the\r\nsame feelings with yourselves, must experience similar suffering, if\r\ntreated in a similar manner. I charge you, then, knowing this, to stand\r\nclear of the crime of his oppression.\"\r\n\r\nThe law, then, by which Moses commanded the children of Israel to\r\nregulate their conduct with respect to the usage of the stranger, I\r\nshowed to be a law of universal and eternal obligation, and for this,\r\namong other reasons, that it was neither more nor less than the\r\nChristian law, which appeared afterwards, that we should not do that to\r\nothers which we should be unwilling to have done unto ourselves.\r\n\r\nHaving gone into these statements at some length, I made an application\r\nof them in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"This being the case, and this law of Moses being afterwards established\r\ninto a fundamental precept of Christianity, I must apply it to facts of\r\nthe present day, and I am sorry that I must apply it to--ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"And first,--Are there no strangers whom we oppress? I fear the wretched\r\nAfrican will say, that he drinks the cup of sorrow, and that he drinks\r\nit at our hands. Torn from his Native soil, and from his family and\r\nfriends, he is immediately forced into a situation, of all others the\r\nmost degrading, where he and his progeny are considered as cattle, as\r\npossessions, and as the possessions of a man to whom he never gave\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n\"It is a melancholy fact, but it can be abundantly proved, that great\r\nnumbers of the unfortunate strangers, who are carried from Africa to our\r\ncolonies, are fraudulently and forcibly taken from their native soil. To\r\ndescant but upon a single instance of the kind must be productive of\r\npain to the ear of sensibility and freedom. Consider the sensations of\r\nthe person, who is thus carried off by the ruffians, who have been\r\nlurking to intercept him. Separated from everything which he esteems in\r\nlife, without the possibility even of bidding his friends adieu, beheld\r\nhim overwhelmed in tears--wringing his hands in despair--looking\r\nbackwards upon the spot where all his hopes and wishes lay;--while his\r\nfamily at home are waiting for him with anxiety and suspense--are\r\nwaiting, perhaps, for sustenance--are agitated between hope and\r\nfear--till length of absence confirms the latter, and they are\r\nimmediately plunged into inconceivable misery and distress.\r\n\r\n\"If this instance, then, is sufficiently melancholy of itself, and is at\r\nall an act of oppression, how complicated will our guilt appear who are\r\nthe means of snatching away thousands annually in the same manner, and\r\nwho force them and their families into the same unhappy situation,\r\nwithout either remorse or shame!\"\r\n\r\nHaving proceeded to show, in a more particular manner than I can detail\r\nhere, how, by means of the Slave Trade, we oppressed the stranger, I\r\nmade an inquiry into the other branch of the subject, or how far we had\r\na knowledge of his heart.\r\n\r\nTo elucidate this point, I mentioned several specific instances out of\r\nthose which I had collected in my journey, and which I could depend upon\r\nas authentic, of honour--gratitude--fidelity--filial, fraternal, and\r\nconjugal affection--and of the finest sensibility on the part of those\r\nwho had been brought into our colonies from Africa in the character of\r\nslaves; and then I proceeded for a while in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"If, then, we oppress the stranger, as I have shown, and if, by a\r\nknowledge of his heart, we find that he is a person of the same passions\r\nand feelings as ourselves, we are certainly breaking, by means of the\r\nprosecution of the Slave Trade, that fundamental principle of\r\nChristianity, which says, that we shall not do that unto another which\r\nwe wish should not be done unto ourselves, and, I fear, cutting\r\nourselves off from all expectation of the Divine blessing. For how\r\ninconsistent is our conduct! We come into the temple of God; we fall\r\nprostrate before Him; we pray to Him, that He will have mercy upon us.\r\nBut how shall He have mercy upon us, who have had no mercy upon others!\r\nWe pray to Him, again, that He will deliver us from evil. But how shall\r\nHe deliver us from evil, who are daily invading the rights of the\r\ninjured African, and heaping misery on his head!\"\r\n\r\nI attempted, lastly, to show, that, though the sin of the Slave Trade\r\nhad been hitherto a sin of ignorance, and might, therefore, have so far\r\nbeen winked at, yet as the crimes and miseries belonging to it became\r\nknown, it would attach even to those who had no concern in it, if they\r\nsuffered it to continue either without notice or reproach, or if they\r\ndid not exert themselves in a reasonable manner for its suppression. I\r\nnoticed particularly, the case of Tyre and Sidon, which were the Bristol\r\nand the Liverpool of those times. A direct judgment had been pronounced\r\nby the prophet Joel against these cities, and, what is remarkable, for\r\nthe prosecution of this same barbarous traffic. Thus, \"And what have ye\r\nto do with me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? Ye\r\nhave cast lots for my people. Ye have sold a girl for wine. The children\r\nof Judah, and the children of Jerusalem, have ye sold unto the Grecians,\r\nthat ye might remove them far from their own border. Behold! I will\r\nraise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will\r\nrecompense your wickedness on your own heads.\" Such was the language of\r\nthe prophet; and Tyre and Sidon fell, as he had pointed out, when the\r\ninhabitants were either cut off, or carried into slavery.\r\n\r\nHaving thrown out these ideas to the notice of the audience, I concluded\r\nin the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"If, then, we wish to avert the heavy national judgment which is hanging\r\nover our heads, (for must we not believe that our crimes towards the\r\ninnocent Africans lie recorded against us in heaven?) let us endeavour\r\nto assert their cause. Let us nobly withstand the torrent of the evil,\r\nhowever inveterately it may be fixed among the customs of the times;\r\nnot, however, using our liberty as a cloak of maliciousness against\r\nthose, who, perhaps, without due consideration, have the misfortune to\r\nbe concerned in it, but upon proper motives, and in a proper spirit, as\r\nthe servants of God; so that if the sun should be turned into darkness,\r\nand the moon into blood, and the very heaven should fall upon us, we may\r\nfall in the general convulsion without dismay, conscious that we have\r\ndone our duty in endeavouring to succour the distressed, and that the\r\nstain of the blood of Africa is not upon us.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Manchester I proceeded to Keddleston in Derbyshire, to spend a day\r\nwith Lord Scarsdale, and to show him my little collection of African\r\nproductions, and to inform him of my progress since I last saw him. Here\r\na letter was forwarded to me from the Reverend John Toogood, of Keington\r\nMagna in Dorsetshire, though I was then unknown to him. He informed me\r\nthat he had addressed several letters to the inhabitants of his own\r\ncounty, through their provincial paper, on the subject of the Slave\r\nTrade, which letters had produced a considerable effect. It appeared,\r\nhowever, that, when he began them, he did not know of the formation of\r\nour committee, or that he had a single coadjutor in the cause.\r\n\r\nFrom Keddleston I turned off to Birmingham, being desirous of visiting\r\nBristol in my way to London, to see if anything new had occurred since I\r\nwas there. I was introduced by letter, at Birmingham, to Sampson and\r\nCharles Lloyd, the brothers of John Lloyd, belonging to our committee,\r\nand members of the religious society of the Quakers. I was highly\r\ngratified in finding that these, in conjunction with Mr. Russell, had\r\nbeen attempting to awaken the attention of the inhabitants to this great\r\nsubject, and that in consequence of their laudable efforts, a spirit was\r\nbeginning to show itself there, as at Manchester, in favour of the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade. The kind manner in which these received\r\nme, and the deep interest which they appeared to take in our cause, led\r\nme to an esteem for them, which, by means of subsequent visits, grew\r\ninto a solid friendship.\r\n\r\nAt length I arrived at Bristol about ten o'clock on Friday morning. But\r\nwhat was my surprise, when almost the first thing I heard from my friend\r\nHarry Gandy was, that a letter had been despatched to me to Liverpool,\r\nnearly a week ago, requesting me immediately to repair to this place;\r\nfor that in consequence of notice from the lords of the Admiralty,\r\nadvertised in the public papers, the trial of the chief mate, whom I had\r\noccasioned to be taken up at Bristol, for the murder of William Lines,\r\nwas coming on at the Old Bailey, and that not an evidence was to be\r\nfound. This intelligence almost paralyzed me. I cannot describe my\r\nfeelings on receiving it. I reproached myself with my own obstinacy for\r\nhaving resisted the advice of Mr. Burges, as has been before explained.\r\nAll his words now came fresh into my mind. I was terrified, too, with\r\nthe apprehension that my own reputation was now at stake. I foresaw all\r\nthe calumnies which would  be spread, if the evidences were not\r\nforthcoming on this occasion. I anticipated, also, the injury which the\r\ncause itself might sustain, if, at our outset, as it were, I should not\r\nbe able to substantiate what I had publicly advanced; and yet the mayor\r\nof Bristol had heard and determined the case,--he had not only examined,\r\nbut re-examined, the evidences,--he had not only committed, but\r\nre-committed, the accused: this was the only consolation I had. I was\r\nsensible, however, amidst all these workings of my mind, that not a\r\nmoment was to be lost, and I began, therefore, to set on foot an inquiry\r\nas to the absent persons.\r\n\r\nOn waiting upon the mother of William Lines, I learnt from her, that two\r\nout of four of the witnesses had been bribed by the slave-merchants, and\r\nsent to sea, that they might not be forthcoming at the time of the\r\ntrial; that the two others had been tempted also, but that they had been\r\nenabled to resist the temptation; that, desirous of giving their\r\ntestimony in this cause, they had gone into some coal-mine between Neath\r\nand Swansea, where they might support themselves till they should be\r\ncalled for; and that she had addressed a letter to them, at the request\r\nof Mr. Gandy, above a week ago, in which she had desired them to come to\r\nBristol immediately, but that she had received no answer from them. She\r\nthen concluded, either that her letter had miscarried, or that they had\r\nleft the place.\r\n\r\nI determined to lose no time, after the receipt of this intelligence;\r\nand I prevailed upon a young man, whom my friend Harry Gandy had\r\nrecommended to me, to set off directly, and to go in search of them. He\r\nwas to travel all night, and to bring them, or, if weary himself with\r\nhis journey, to send them up, without ever sleeping on the road. It was\r\nnow between twelve and one in the afternoon. I saw him depart. In the\r\ninterim I went to Thompson's, and other places, to inquire if any other\r\nof the seamen, belonging to the Thomas, were to be found; but, though I\r\nhunted diligently till four o'clock, I could learn nothing satisfactory.\r\nI then went to dinner, but I grew uneasy. I was fearful that my\r\nmessenger might be at a loss, or that he might want assistance on some\r\noccasion or other. I now judged that it would have been more prudent if\r\ntwo persons had been sent, who might have conferred with each other, and\r\nwho might have divided, when they had reached Neath, and gone to\r\ndifferent mines, to inquire for the witnesses. These thoughts disturbed\r\nme. Those, also, which had occurred when I first heard of the vexatious\r\nway in which things were situated, renewed themselves painfully to my\r\nmind. My own obstinacy in resisting the advice of Mr. Burges, and the\r\nfear of injury to my own reputation, and to that of the cause I had\r\nundertaken, were again before my eyes. I became still more uneasy: and I\r\nhad no way of relieving my feelings, but by resolving to follow the\r\nyoung man, and to give him all the aid in my power.\r\n\r\nIt was now near six o'clock. The night was cold and rainy and almost\r\ndark. I got down, however, safe to the passage-house, and desired to be\r\nconveyed across the Severn. The people in the house tried to dissuade me\r\nfrom my design. They said no one would accompany me, for it was quite a\r\ntempest. I replied that I would pay those handsomely who would go with\r\nme. A person present asked me if I would give him three guineas for a\r\nboat. I replied I would. He could not for shame retract. He went out,\r\nand in about half an hour brought a person with him. We were obliged to\r\nhave a lanthorn as far as the boat. We got on board, and went off. But\r\nsuch a passage I had never before witnessed. The wind was furious. The\r\nwaves ran high. I could see nothing but white foam. The boat, also, was\r\ntossed up and down in such a manner that it was with great difficulty I\r\ncould keep my seat. The rain, too, poured down in such torrents that we\r\nwere all of us presently wet through. We had been, I apprehend, more\r\nthan an hour in this situation, when the boatmen began to complain of\r\ncold and weariness. I saw, also, that they began to be uneasy, for they\r\ndid not know where they were. They had no way of forming any judgment\r\nabout their course, but by knowing the point from whence the wind blew,\r\nand by keeping the boat in a relative position towards it. I encouraged\r\nthem as well as I could, though I was beginning to be uneasy myself, and\r\nalso sick. In about a quarter of an hour they began to complain again.\r\nThey said they could pull no longer. They acknowledged, however, that\r\nthey were getting nearer to the shore, though on what part of it they\r\ncould not tell. I could do nothing but bid them hope. They then began to\r\nreproach themselves for having come out with me. I told them I had not\r\nforced them, but that it was a matter of their own choice. In the midst\r\nof this conversation I informed them that I thought I saw either a star\r\nor a light straight forward. They both looked at it and pronounced it to\r\nbe a light, and added with great joy that it must be a light in the\r\nPassage-house; and so we found it; for in about ten minutes afterwards\r\nwe landed, and, on reaching the house, learnt that a servant maid had\r\nbeen accidentally talking to some other person on the stair-case, near a\r\nwindow, with a candle in her hand, and that the light had appeared to us\r\nfrom that circumstance.\r\n\r\nIt was now near eleven o'clock. My messenger, it appeared, had arrived\r\nsafe about five in the evening, and had proceeded on his route. I was\r\nvery cold on my arrival, and sick also. There seemed to be a chilliness\r\nall over me, both within and without. Indeed I had not a dry thread\r\nabout me. I took some hot brandy and water, and went to bed; but\r\ndesired, as soon as my clothes were thoroughly dried, to be called up,\r\nthat I might go forward. This happened at about two in the morning, when\r\nI got up. I took my breakfast by the fire-side. I then desired the\r\npost-boy, if he should meet any persons on the road, to stop and inform\r\nme, as I did not know whether the witnesses might not be coming up by\r\nthemselves, and whether they might not have passed my messenger without\r\nknowing his errand. Having taken these precautions, I departed. I\r\ntravelled on, but we met no one. I traced, however, my messenger through\r\nNewport, Cardiff, and Cowbridge. I was assured, also, that he had not\r\npassed me on his return; nor had any of those passed me whom he was\r\nseeking. At length, when I was within about two miles of Neath I met\r\nhim. He had both the witnesses under his care. This was a matter of\r\ngreat joy to me. I determined to return with them. It was now nearly two\r\nin the afternoon. I accordingly went back, but we did not reach the\r\nPassage-house again till nearly two the next morning.\r\n\r\nDuring our journey, neither the wind nor the rain had much abated. It\r\nwas quite dark on our arrival. We found only one person, and he had been\r\nsitting up in expectation of us. It was in vain that I asked him for a\r\nboat to put us across the water. He said all the boatmen were in bed;\r\nand, if they were up, he was sure that none of them would venture out.\r\nIt was thought a mercy by all of them that we were not lost last night.\r\nDifficulties were also started about horses to take us another way.\r\nUnable, therefore, to proceed, we took refreshment and went to bed.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Bristol between nine and ten the next morning; but I was\r\nso ill that I could go no further; I had been cold and shivering ever\r\nsince my first passage across the Severn; and I had now a violent sore\r\nthroat and a fever with it. All I could do was to see the witnesses off\r\nfor London, and to assign them to the care of an attorney, who should\r\nconduct them to the trial. For this purpose I gave them a letter to a\r\nfriend of the name of Langdale. I saw them depart. The mother of William\r\nLines accompanied them. By a letter received on Tuesday, I learnt that\r\nthey had not arrived in town till Monday morning at three o'clock; that\r\nat about nine or ten they found out the office of Mr. Langdale; that, on\r\ninquiring for him, they heard he was in the country, but that he would\r\nbe home at noon; that, finding he had not then arrived, they acquainted\r\nhis clerk with the nature of their business, and opened my letter to\r\nshow him the contents of it; that the clerk went with them to consult\r\nsome other person on the subject, when he conveyed them to the Old\r\nBailey; but that, on inquiring at the proper place about the\r\nintroduction of the witnesses, he learnt that the chief mate had been\r\nbrought to the bar in the morning, and, no person then appearing against\r\nhim, that he had been discharged by proclamation. Such was the end of\r\nall my anxiety and labour in this affair. I was very ill when I received\r\nthe letter; but I saw the necessity of bearing up against the\r\ndisappointment, and I endeavoured to discharge the subject from my mind\r\nwith the following wish, that the narrow escape which the chief mate had\r\nexperienced, and which was entirely owing to the accidental\r\ncircumstances now explained, might have the effect, under Providence, of\r\nproducing in him a deep contrition for his offence, and of awakening him\r\nto a serious attention to his future life[A].\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: He had undoubtedly a narrow escape; for Mr. Langdale's\r\nclerk had learnt that he had no evidence to produce in his favour. The\r\nslave-merchants, it seems, had counted most upon bribing those who were\r\nto come against him, to disappear.]\r\n\r\nI was obliged to remain in Bristol a few days longer in consequence of\r\nmy illness; but as soon as I was able I reached London, when I attended\r\na sitting of the committee after an absence of more than five months. At\r\nthis committee it was strongly recommended to me to publish a second\r\nedition of my _Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species_,\r\nand to insert such of the facts in it in their proper places, out of\r\nthose collected in my late travels, as I might judge to be productive of\r\nan interesting effect. There appeared, also, an earnest desire in the\r\ncommittee, that, directly after this, I should begin my _Essay on the\r\nImpolicy of the Slave Trade_.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with their wishes, I determined upon both these works; but\r\nI resolved to retire into the country, that, by being subject to less\r\ninterruption there, I might the sooner finish them. It was proper,\r\nhowever, that I should settle many things in London before I took my\r\ndeparture from it; and, among these, that I should find out George\r\nOrmond and Patrick Murray, whom I had sent from Liverpool on account of\r\nthe information they had given me relative to the murder of Peter Green.\r\nI saw no better way than to take them before Sir Sampson Wright, who was\r\nthen at the head of the police of the metropolis. He examined and\r\ncross-examined them several times, and apart from each other. He then\r\ndesired their evidence to be drawn up in the form of depositions, copies\r\nof which he gave to me. He had no doubt that the murder would be proved.\r\nThe circumstances of the deceased being in good health at nine o'clock\r\nin the evening, and of his severe sufferings till eleven, and of the\r\nnature of the wounds discovered to have been made on his person, and of\r\nhis death by one in the morning, could never, he said, be done away by\r\nany evidence who should state that he had been subject to other\r\ndisorders which might have occasioned his decease. He found himself,\r\ntherefore, compelled to apply to the magistrates of Liverpool, for the\r\napprehension of three of the principal officers of the ship; but the\r\nanswer was that the ship had sailed, and that they whose names had been\r\nspecified were then, none of them, to be found in Liverpool.\r\n\r\nIt was now for me to consider whether I would keep the two witnesses,\r\nOrmond and Murray, for a year, or perhaps longer, at my own expense, and\r\nrun the hazard of the death of the officers in the interim, and of other\r\ncalculable events. I had felt so deeply for the usage of the seamen in\r\nthis cruel traffic, which indeed had embittered all my journey, that I\r\nhad no less than nine prosecutions at law upon my hands on their\r\naccount, and nineteen witnesses detained at my own cost. The committee\r\nin London could give me no assistance in these cases. They were the\r\nmanagers of the public purse for the abolition of the Slave Trade, and\r\nany expenses of this kind were neither within the limits of their\r\nobject, nor within the pale of their duty. From the individuals\r\nbelonging to it, I picked up a few guineas by way of private\r\nsubscription, and this was all. But a vast load still remained upon me,\r\nand such as had occasioned uneasiness to my mind. I thought it,\r\ntherefore, imprudent to detain the evidences for this purpose for so\r\nlong a time, and I sent them back to Liverpool. I commenced, however, a\r\nprosecution against the captain at common law for his barbarous usage of\r\nthem, and desired that it might be pushed on as vigorously as possible;\r\nand the result was, that his attorney was so alarmed, particularly after\r\nknowing what had been done by Sir Sampson Wright, that he entered into a\r\ncompromise to pay all the expenses of the suit hitherto incurred, and to\r\ngive Ormond and Murray a sum of money as damages for the injury which\r\nthey themselves had sustained. This compromise was acceded to. The men\r\nreceived the money, and signed the release, (of which I insisted upon a\r\ncopy,) and went to sea again in another trade, thanking me for my\r\ninterference in their behalf. But by this copy, which I have now in my\r\npossession, it appears that care was taken by the captain's attorney to\r\nrender their future evidence in the case of Peter Green almost\r\nimpracticable; for it was there wickedly stated, \"that George Ormond and\r\nPatrick Murray did then and there bind themselves in certain penalties\r\nthat they would neither encourage nor support any action at law against\r\nthe said captain, by or at the suit or prosecution of any other of the\r\nseamen now or late on board the said ship, and that they released the\r\nsaid captain also from all manner of actions, suits, and cause and\r\ncauses of action, informations, prosecutions, and other proceedings\r\nwhich they then had, or ever had, or could or might have, by reason of\r\nthe said assaults upon their own persons, or _other wrongs or injuries\r\ndone by the said captain heretofore and to the date of this\r\nrelease_[A].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: None of the nine actions before mentioned ever came to a\r\ntrial; but they were all compromised by paying sums to the injured\r\nparties.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nLabours of the committee during the author's journey; Quakers the\r\nfirst to notice its institution; General Baptists the\r\nnext.--Correspondence opened with American societies for\r\nAbolition.--First individual who addressed the committee was Mr.\r\nWilliam Smith.--Thanks voted to Ramsay.--Committee prepares lists of\r\npersons to whom to send its publications; Barclay, Taylor, and\r\nWedgewood, elected members of the committee.--Letters from Brissot and\r\nothers.--Granville Sharp elected chairman,--Seal ordered to be\r\nengraved.--Letters from different correspondents, as they offered\r\ntheir services to the committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe committee, during my absence, had attended regularly at their posts;\r\nthey had been both vigilant and industrious; they were, in short, the\r\npersons who had been the means of raising the public spirit which I had\r\nobserved first at Manchester, and afterwards as I journeyed on. It will\r\nbe proper, therefore, that I should now say something of their labours,\r\nand of the fruits of them: and if, in doing this, I should be more\r\nminute for a few pages than some would wish, I must apologize for myself\r\nby saying, that there are others who would be sorry to lose the\r\nknowledge of the particular manner in which the foundation was laid, and\r\nthe superstructure advanced, of a work which will make so brilliant an\r\nappearance in our history, as that of the abolition of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nThe committee having dispersed five hundred circular letters, giving an\r\naccount of their institution in London and its neighbourhood, the\r\nQuakers were the first to notice it. This they did in their yearly\r\nepistle, of which the following is an extract:--\"We have also thankfully\r\nto believe there is a growing attention in many, not of our religious\r\nsociety, to the subject of negro slavery; and that the minds of the\r\npeople are more and more enlarged to consider it as an aggregate of\r\nevery species of evil, and to see the utter inconsistency of upholding\r\nit by the authority of any nation whatever, especially of such as\r\npunish, with loss of life, crimes whose magnitude bears scarce any\r\nproportion to this complicated iniquity.\"\r\n\r\nThe General Baptists were the next; for on the 22nd of June, Stephen\r\nLowdell and Dan Taylor attended as a deputation from the annual meeting\r\nof that religious body, to inform the committee, that those whom they\r\nrepresented approved their proceedings, and that they would countenance\r\nthe object of their institution.\r\n\r\nThe first individual who addressed the committee was Mr. William Smith,\r\nthe late member for Norwich. In his letter, he expressed the pleasure he\r\nhad received in finding persons associated in the support of a cause in\r\nwhich he himself had taken a deep interest. He gave them advice as to\r\ntheir future plans. He promised them all the co-operation in his power:\r\nand he exhorted them not to despair, even if their first attempt should\r\nbe unsuccessful; \"for consolation,\" says he, \"will not be wanting. You\r\nmay rest satisfied that the attempt will be productive of some good;\r\nthat the fervent wishes of the righteous will be on your side, and that\r\nthe blessing of those who are ready to perish will fall upon you.\" And\r\nas Mr. Smith was the first person to address the committee as an\r\nindividual after its formation, so, next to Mr. Wilberforce and the\r\nmembers of it, he gave the most time and attention to the promotion of\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of July, the committee opened a correspondence, by means of\r\nWilliam Dillwyn, with the societies of Philadelphia and New York, of\r\nwhose institution an account has been given. At this sitting a due sense\r\nwas signified of the services of Mr. Ramsay, and a desire of his\r\nfriendly communications when convenient.\r\n\r\nThe two next meetings were principally occupied in making out lists of\r\nthe names of persons in the country, to whom the committee should send\r\ntheir publications for distribution. For this purpose, every member was\r\nto bring in an account of those whom he knew personally, and whom he\r\nbelieved not only to be willing, but qualified on account of their\r\njudgment and the weight of their character, to take an useful part in\r\nthe work which was to be assigned to them. It is a remarkable\r\ncircumstance, that when the lists were arranged, the committee, few as\r\nthey were, found they had friends in no less than thirty-nine\r\ncounties[A], in each of which there were several, so that a knowledge of\r\ntheir institution could now be soon diffusively spread.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The Quakers, by means of their discipline, have a greater\r\npersonal knowledge of each other, than the members of any other\r\nreligious society. But two-thirds of the committee were Quakers, and\r\nhence the circumstance is explained. Hence also nine-tenths of our first\r\ncoadjutors were Quakers.]\r\n\r\nThe committee having now fixed upon their correspondents, ordered five\r\nhundred of the circular letters which have been before mentioned, and\r\nfive thousand of the _Summary View_, an account of which has been given\r\nalso, to be printed.\r\n\r\nOn account of the increase of business, which was expected in\r\nconsequence of the circulation of the preceding publications, Robert\r\nBarclay, John Vickris Taylor, and Josiah Wedgewood, Esq., were added to\r\nthe committee; and it was then resolved, that any three members might\r\ncall a meeting when necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of August, the new correspondents began to make their\r\nappearance. This sitting was distinguished by the receipt of letters\r\nfrom two celebrated persons. The first was from Brissot, dated Paris,\r\nAugust the 18th, who, it may be recollected, was an active member of the\r\nNational Convention of France, and who suffered in the persecution of\r\nRobespierre. The second was from Mr. John Wesley, whose useful labours\r\nas a minister of the Gospel, are so well known to our countrymen.\r\n\r\nBrissot, in his letter, congratulated the members of the committee, on\r\nhaving come together for so laudable an object. He offered his own\r\nassistance towards the promotion of it. He desired, also, that his\r\nvaluable friend Claviere (who suffered also under Robespierre) might be\r\njoined to him, and that both might be acknowledged by the committee, as\r\nassociates in what he called this heavenly work. He purposed to\r\ntranslate and circulate through France such publications as they might\r\nsend him from time to time; and to appoint bankers in Paris, who might\r\nreceive subscriptions, and remit them to London, for the good of their\r\ncommon cause. In the mean time, if his own countrymen should be found to\r\ntake an interest in this great cause, it was not improbable that a\r\ncommittee might be formed in Paris, to endeavour to secure the\r\nattainment of the same object from the government in France.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of the committee were voted to Brissot for this disinterested\r\noffer of his services, and he was elected an honorary and corresponding\r\nmember. In reply, however, to his letter, it was stated that, as the\r\ncommittee had no doubt of procuring from the generosity of their own\r\nnation sufficient funds for effecting the object of their institution,\r\nthey declined the acceptance of any pecuniary aid from the people of\r\nFrance; but recommended him to attempt the formation of a committee in\r\nhis own country, and to inform them of his progress, and to make to them\r\nsuch other communications as he might deem necessary upon the subject\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nMr. Wesley, whose letter was read next, informed the committee of the\r\ngreat satisfaction which he also had experienced, when he heard of their\r\nformation. He conceived that their design, while it would destroy the\r\nSlave Trade, would also strike at the root of the shocking abomination\r\nof slavery also. He desired to forewarn them that they must expect\r\ndifficulties and great opposition from those who were interested in the\r\nsystem; that these were a powerful body; and that they would raise all\r\ntheir forces, when they perceived their craft to be in danger. They\r\nwould employ hireling writers, who would have neither justice nor mercy.\r\nBut the committee were not to be dismayed by such treatment, nor even if\r\nsome of those who professed goodwill towards them, should turn against\r\nthem. As for himself, he would do all he could to promote the object of\r\ntheir institution. He would reprint a new and large edition of his\r\n_Thought on Slavery_, and circulate it among his friends in England and\r\nIreland, to whom he would add a few words in favour of their design. And\r\nthen he concluded in these words: \"I commend you to Him who is able to\r\ncarry you through all opposition, and support you under all\r\ndiscouragements.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th, 11th, and 18th of September, the committee were employed\r\nvariously. Among other things, they voted their thanks to Mr. Leigh, a\r\nclergyman of the Established Church, for the offer of his services for\r\nthe county of Norfolk. They ordered, also, one thousand of the circular\r\nletters to be additionally printed.\r\n\r\nAt one of these meetings a resolution was made, that Granville Sharp,\r\nEsq. be appointed chairman. This appointment, though now first formally\r\nmade in the minute book, was always understood to have taken place; but\r\nthe modesty of Mr. Sharp was such that, though repeatedly pressed, he\r\nwould never consent to take the chair; and he generally refrained from\r\ncoming into the room till after he knew it to be taken. Nor could he be\r\nprevailed upon, even after this resolution, to alter his conduct: for\r\nthough he continued to sign the papers, which were handed to him by\r\nvirtue of holding this office, he never was once seated as the chairman,\r\nduring the twenty years in which he attended at these meetings. I\r\nthought it not improper to mention this trait in his character.\r\nConscious that he engaged in the cause of his fellow-creatures, solely\r\nupon the sense of his duty as a Christian, he seems to have supposed\r\neither that he had done nothing extraordinary to merit such a\r\ndistinction, or to have been fearful lest the acceptance of it should\r\nbring a stain upon the motive, on which alone he undertook it.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd and 16th of October two sittings took place; at the latter of\r\nwhich a sub-committee, which had been appointed for the purpose, brought\r\nin a design for a seal. An African was seen, (as in the figure[A],) in\r\nchains, in a supplicating posture, kneeling with one knee upon the\r\nground, and with both his hands lifted up to heaven, and round the seal\r\nwas observed the following motto, as if he was uttering the words\r\nhimself,--\"Am I not a Man and a Brother?\" The design having been\r\napproved of, a seal was ordered to be engraved from it. I may mention\r\nhere that this seal, simple as the design was, was made to contribute\r\nlargely, as will be shown in its proper place, towards turning the\r\nattention of our countrymen to the case of the injured Africans, and of\r\nprocuring a warm interest in their favour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The figure is rather larger than that in the seal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Seal]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of October several letters were read: one of these was from\r\nBrissot and Claviere conjointly; in this they acknowledged the\r\nsatisfaction they had received on being considered as associates in the\r\nhumane work of the abolition of the Slave Trade, and correspondents in\r\nFrance for the promotion of it. They declared it to be their intention\r\nto attempt the establishment of a committee there, on the same\r\nprinciples as that in England; but, in consequence of the different\r\nconstitutions of the two governments, they gave the committee reason to\r\nsuppose, that their proceedings must be different, as well as slower\r\nthan those in England, for the same object.\r\n\r\nA second letter was read from Mr. John Wesley. He said that he had now\r\nread the publications which the committee had sent him, and that he\r\ntook, if possible, a still deeper interest in their cause. He exhorted\r\nthem to more than ordinary diligence and perseverance; to be prepared\r\nfor opposition; to be cautious about the manner of procuring information\r\nand evidence, that no stain might fall upon their character; and to take\r\ncare that the question should be argued, as well upon the consideration\r\nof interest as of humanity and justice, the former of which he feared\r\nwould have more weight than the latter; and he recommended them and\r\ntheir glorious concern, as before, to the protection of Him who was able\r\nto support them.\r\n\r\nLetters were read from Dr. Price, approving the institution of the\r\ncommittee; from Charles Lloyd of Birmingham, stating the interest which\r\nthe inhabitants of that town were taking in it; and from William\r\nRussell, Esq. of the same place, stating the same circumstance, and that\r\nhe would co-operate with the former in calling a public meeting, and in\r\ndoing whatever else was necessary for the promotion of so good a cause.\r\nA letter was read also from Manchester, signed conjointly by George\r\nBarton Thomas Cooper, John Ferriar, Thomas Walker, Thomas Phillips,\r\nThomas Butterworth Bayley, and George Lloyd, Esqrs., promising their\r\nassistance from that place. Two others were read from John Kerrich,\r\nEsq., of Harleston, and from Joshua Grigby, Esq., of Drinkston, each\r\ntendering their services, one for the county Of Norfolk, and the other\r\nfor the county of Suffolk. The latter concluded by saying, \"With respect\r\nto myself, in no possible instance of my public conduct can I receive so\r\nmuch sincere satisfaction, as I shall, by the vote I will most assuredly\r\ngive in parliament, in support of this most worthy effort to suppress a\r\ntraffic, which is contrary to all the feelings of humanity, and the laws\r\nof our religion.\"\r\n\r\nA letter was read also at this sitting from Major Cartwright, of\r\nMarnham, in which he offered his own services, in conjunction with those\r\nof the Rev. John Charlesworth, of Ossington, for the county of\r\nNottingham.\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you,\" says he, in this letter, \"on the happy prospect of\r\nsome considerable step at least being taken, towards the abolition of a\r\ntraffic, which is not only impious in itself, but of all others tends\r\nmost to vitiate the human mind.\r\n\r\n\"Although procrastination is generally pernicious in cases depending\r\nupon the feelings of the heart, I should almost fear that, without very\r\nuncommon exertions, you will scarcely be prepared early in the next\r\nsessions, for bringing the business into parliament with the greatest\r\nadvantage. But, be that as it may, let the best use be made of the\r\nintermediate time; and then, if there be a superintending Providence,\r\nwhich governs everything in the moral world, there is every reason to\r\nhope for a blessing on this particular work.\"\r\n\r\nThe last letter was from Robert Boucher Nickolls, dean of Middleham, in\r\nYorkshire. In this he stated that he was a native of the West Indies,\r\nand had travelled on the continent of America. He then offered some\r\nimportant information to the committee as his mite, towards the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade, and as an encouragement to them to\r\npersevere. He attempted to prove, that the natural increase of the\r\nnegroes already in the West Indian islands would be fully adequate to\r\nthe cultivation of them, without any fresh supplies from Africa; and\r\nthat such natural increase would be secured by humane treatment. With\r\nthis view, he instanced the two estates of Mr. MacMahon and of Dr. Mapp,\r\nin the island of Barbados. The first required continual supplies of new\r\nslaves, in consequence of the severe and cruel usage adopted upon it.\r\nThe latter overflowed with labourers in consequence of a system of\r\nkindness, so that it almost peopled another estate. Having related these\r\ninstances, he cited others in North America, where, though the climate\r\nwas less favourable to the constitution of the Africans, but their\r\ntreatment better, they increased also. He combated, from his own\r\npersonal knowledge, the argument, that self-interest was always\r\nsufficient to insure good usage, and maintained that there was only one\r\nway of securing it, which was the entire abolition of the Slave Trade.\r\nHe showed in what manner the latter measure would operate to the desired\r\nend: he then dilated on the injustice and inconsistency of this trade,\r\nand supported the policy of the abolition of it, both to the planter,\r\nthe merchant, and the nation.\r\n\r\nThis letter of the Dean of Middleham, which was a little Essay of\r\nitself, was deemed of so much importance by the committee, but\r\nparticularly as it was the result of local knowledge, that they not only\r\npassed a resolution of thanks to him for it, but desired his permission\r\nto print it.\r\n\r\nThe committee sat again on the 13th and 22nd of November. At the first\r\nof these sittings, a letter was read from Henry Grimston, Esq., of\r\nWhitwell Hall, near York, offering his services for the promotion of the\r\ncause in his own county. At the second, the Dean of Middleham's answer\r\nwas received. He acquiesced in the request of the committee; when five\r\nthousand of his letters were ordered immediately to be printed.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd a letter was read from Mr. James Mackenzie, of the town of\r\nCambridge, desiring to forward the object of the institution there. Two\r\nletters were read also, one from the late Mr. Jones, tutor of Trinity\r\nCollege, and the other from Mr. William Frend, fellow of Jesus College.\r\nIt appeared from these, that the gentlemen of the University of\r\nCambridge were beginning to take a lively interest in the abolition of\r\nthe Slave Trade, among whom Dr. Watson, the bishop of Llandaff, was\r\nparticularly conspicuous. At this committee two thousand new _Summary\r\nView_ were ordered to be printed, and the circular letter to be prefixed\r\nto each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nLabours of the committee continued to February, 1788.--Committee elect\r\nnew members; vote thanks to Falconbridge and others; receive letters\r\nfrom Grove and others; circulate numerous publications; make a report;\r\nsend circular letters to corporate bodies; release negroes unjustly\r\ndetained; find new correspondents in Archdeacon Paley, the Marquis de\r\nla Fayette, Bishop of Cloyne, Bishop of Peterborough, and in many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe labours of the committee, during my absence, were as I have now\r\nexplained them; but as I was obliged, almost immediately, on joining\r\nthem, to retire into the country to begin my new work, I must give an\r\naccount of their further services till I joined them again, or till the\r\nmiddle of February, 1788.\r\n\r\nDuring sittings which were held from the middle of December, 1787, to\r\nthe 18th of January, 1788, the business of the committee had so\r\nincreased, that it was found proper to make an addition to their number.\r\nAccordingly James Martin and William Morton Pitt, Esquires, members of\r\nparliament, and Robert Hunter, and Joseph Smith, Esquires, were chosen\r\nmembers of it.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge also of the institution of the society had spread to such\r\nan extent, and the eagerness among individuals to see the publications\r\nof the committee had been so great, that the press was kept almost\r\nconstantly going during the time now mentioned. No fewer than three\r\nthousand lists of the subscribers, with a circular letter prefixed to\r\nthem, explaining the object of the institution, were ordered to be\r\nprinted within this period, to which are to be added fifteen hundred of\r\nBENEZET'S _Account of Guinea_, three thousand of the DEAN of MIDDLEHAM'S\r\n_Letters_, five thousand _Summary View,_ and two thousand of a new\r\nedition of the _Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species_, which I had\r\nenlarged before the last of these sittings from materials collected in\r\nmy late tour.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of the committee were voted during this period to Mr.\r\nAlexander Falconbridge, for the assistance he had given me in my\r\ninquiries into the nature of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Falconbridge had but lately returned from Africa, and as facts\r\nand circumstances, which had taken place but a little time ago, were\r\nless liable to objections (inasmuch as they proved the present state of\r\nthings) than those which happened in earlier times, he was prevailed\r\nupon to write an account of what he had seen during the four voyages he\r\nhad made to that continent; and accordingly, within the period which has\r\nbeen mentioned, he began his work.\r\n\r\nThe committee, during these sittings, kept up a correspondence with\r\nthose gentlemen who were mentioned in the last chapter to have addressed\r\nthem. But, besides these, they found other voluntary correspondents in\r\nthe following persons, Capell Lofft, Esq., of Troston, and the Reverend\r\nB. Brome, of Ipswich, both in the county of Suffolk. These made an\r\nearnest tender of their services for those parts of the county in which\r\nthey resided. Similar offers were made by Mr. Hammond, of Stanton, near\r\nSt. Ives, in the county of Huntingdon, by Thomas Parker, Esq., of\r\nBeverly, and by William Grove, Esq., of Litchfield, for their respective\r\ntowns and neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nA letter was received also within this period from the society\r\nestablished at Philadelphia, accompanied with documents in proof of the\r\ngood effects of the manumission of slaves, and with specimens of writing\r\nand drawing by the same. In this letter the society congratulated the\r\ncommittee in London on its formation, and professed its readiness to\r\nco-operate in any way in which it could me made useful.\r\n\r\nDuring these sittings, a letter was also read from Dr. Bathurst,\r\nafterwards bishop of Norwich, dated Oxford, December 17th, in which he\r\noffered his services in the promotion of the cause.\r\n\r\nAnother was read, which stated that Dr. Home, president of Magdalen\r\nCollege in the same university, and afterwards bishop of the same see as\r\nthe former, highly favoured it.\r\n\r\nAnother was read from Mr. Lambert, fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,\r\nin which he signified to the committee the great desire he had to\r\npromote the object of their institution. He had drawn up a number of\r\nqueries relative to the state of the unhappy slaves in the islands,\r\nwhich he had transmitted to a friend, who had resided in them, to\r\nanswer. These answers he purposed to forward to the committee on their\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nAnother was read from Dr. Hinchliffe, bishop of Peterborough, in which\r\nhe testified his hearty approbation of the institution, and of the\r\ndesign of it, and his determination to support the object of it in\r\nparliament. He gave in at the same time a plan, which he called\r\n_Thoughts on the Means of Abolishing the Slave Trade in Great Britain\r\nand in our West Indian Islands_, for the consideration of the committee.\r\n\r\nAt the last of these sittings, the committee thought it right to make a\r\nreport to the public relative to the state and progress of their cause;\r\nbut as this was composed from materials which the reader has now in his\r\npossession, it may not be necessary to produce it.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd and 29th of January, and on the 5th and 12th of February,\r\n1788, sittings were also held. During these, the business still\r\nincreasing, John Maitland, Esq., was elected a member of the committee.\r\n\r\nAs the correspondents of the committee were now numerous, and as these\r\nsolicited publications for the use of those who applied to them, as well\r\nas of those to whom they wished to give a knowledge of the subject, the\r\npress was kept in constant employ during this period also. Five thousand\r\ntwo hundred and fifty additional _Reports_ were ordered to be printed,\r\nand also three thousand of FALCONBRIDGE'S _Account of the Slave Trade_,\r\nthe manuscript of which was now finished. At this time, Mr. Newton,\r\nrector of St. Mary Woolnoth in London, who had been in his youth to the\r\ncoast of Africa, but who had now become a serious and useful divine,\r\nfelt it his duty to write his _Thoughts on the African Slave Trade_. The\r\ncommittee, having obtained permission, printed three thousand copies of\r\nthese also.\r\n\r\nDuring these sittings, the chairman was requested to have frequent\r\ncommunication with Dr. Porteus, bishop of London, as he had expressed\r\nhis desire of becoming useful to the institution.\r\n\r\nA circular letter also, with the report before mentioned, was ordered to\r\nbe sent to the majors of several corporate towns.\r\n\r\nA case also occurred, which it may not be improper to notice. The\r\ntreasurer reported that he had been informed by the chairman, that the\r\ncaptain of the Albion, merchant ship, trading to the Bay of Honduras,\r\nhad picked up at sea, from a Spanish ship, which had been wrecked, two\r\nblack men, one named Henry Martin Burrowes, a free native of Antigua,\r\nwho had served in the royal navy, and the other named Antonio Berrat, a\r\nSpanish negro; that the said captain detained these men on board his\r\nship, then lying in the river Thames, against their will; and that, he\r\nwould not give them up. Upon this report, it was resolved that the cause\r\nof these unfortunate captives should be espoused by the committee. Mr.\r\nSharp accordingly caused a writ of habeas-corpus to be served upon them;\r\nsoon after which he had the satisfaction of reporting, that they had\r\nbeen delivered from the place of their confinement.\r\n\r\nDuring these sittings the following letters were read also:\r\n\r\nOne from Richard How, of Apsley, offering his services to the committee.\r\n\r\nAnother from the Reverend Christopher Wyvill, of Burton Hall, in\r\nYorkshire, to the same effect.\r\n\r\nAnother from Archdeacon Plymley, (afterwards Corbett,) in which he\r\nexpressed the deep interest he took in this cause of humanity and\r\nfreedom, and the desire he had of making himself useful as far as he\r\ncould towards the support of it; and he wished to know, as the Clergy of\r\nthe diocese of Lichfield and Coventry were anxious to espouse it also,\r\nwhether a petition to parliament from them, as a part of the Established\r\nChurch, would not be desirable at the present season.\r\n\r\nAnother from Archdeacon Paley, containing his sentiments on a plan for\r\nthe abolition of the Slave Trade, and the manumission of slaves in our\r\nislands, and offering his future services, and wishing success to the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nAnother from Dr. Sharp, prebendary of Durham, inquiring into the\r\nprobable amount of the subscriptions which might be wanted, and for what\r\npurposes, with a view of serving the cause.\r\n\r\nAnother from Dr. Woodward, bishop of Cloyne, in which he approved of the\r\ninstitution of the committee. He conceived the Slave Trade to be no less\r\ndisgraceful to the legislature and injurious to the true commercial\r\ninterests of the country, than it was productive of unmerited misery to\r\nthe unhappy objects of it, and repugnant both to the principles and the\r\nspirit of the Christian religion. He wished to be placed among the\r\nassertors of the liberty of his fellow-creatures, and he was therefore\r\ndesirous of subscribing largely, as well as of doing all he could, both\r\nin England and Ireland, for the promotion of such a charitable work.\r\n\r\nA communication was made, soon after the reading of the last letter,\r\nthrough the medium of the Chevalier de Ternant, from the celebrated\r\nMarquis de la Fayette of France. The Marquis signified the singular\r\npleasure he had received on hearing of the formation of a committee in\r\nEngland for the abolition of the Slave Trade, and the earnest desire he\r\nhad to promote the object of it. With this view, he informed the\r\ncommittee that he should attempt the formation of a similar society in\r\nFrance. This he conceived to be one of the most effectual measures he\r\ncould devise for securing the object in question; for he was of opinion,\r\nthat if the two great nations of France and England were to unite in\r\nthis humane and Christian work, the other European nations might be\r\ninduced to follow the example.\r\n\r\nThe committee, on receiving the two latter communications, resolved,\r\nthat the chairman should return their thanks to the Bishop of Cloyne,\r\nand the Marquis de la Fayette, and the Chevalier de Ternant, and that he\r\nshould inform them, that they were enrolled among the honorary and\r\ncorresponding members of the society.\r\n\r\nThe other letters read during these sittings were to convey information\r\nto the committee, that people in various parts of the kingdom had then\r\nfelt themselves so deeply interested in behalf of the injured Africans,\r\nthat they had determined either on public meetings, or had come to\r\nresolutions, or had it in contemplation to petition parliament, for the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade. Information was signified to this effect\r\nby Thomas Walker, Esquire, for Manchester; by John Hoyland, William\r\nHoyles, Esquire, and the Reverend James Wilkinson, for Sheffield; by\r\nWilliam Tuke, and William Burgh, Esquire, for York; by the Reverend Mr.\r\nFoster, for Colchester; by Joseph Harford and Edmund Griffith, Esquires,\r\nfor Bristol; by William Bishop, Esquire, the mayor, for Maidstone; by\r\nthe Reverend R. Brome and the Reverend J. Wright, for Ipswich; by James\r\nClarke, Esquire, the mayor, for Coventry; by Mr. Jones, of Trinity\r\nCollege, for the University of Cambridge; by Dr. Schomberg, of Magdalen\r\nCollege, for the University of Oxford; by Henry Bullen, Esquire, for\r\nBury St. Edmunds; by Archdeacon Travis, for Chester; by Mr. Hammond, for\r\nthe county of Huntingdon; by John Flint, Esquire, (afterwards Corbett,)\r\nfor the town of Shrewsbury and county of Salop; by the Reverend Robert\r\nLucas, for the town and also for the county of Northampton; by Mr.\r\nWinchester, for the county of Stafford; by the Reverend William Leigh,\r\nfor the county of Norfolk; by David Barclay, for the county of Hertford;\r\nand by Thomas Babington, Esquire, for the county of Leicester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nFurther progress to the middle of May.--Petitions begin to be sent to\r\nparliament.--The king orders the privy council to inquire into the\r\nSlave Trade.--Author called up to town; his interviews with Mr. Pitt,\r\nand with Mr.(afterwards Lord) Grenville.--Liverpool delegates examined\r\nfirst; these prejudice the council; this prejudice at length\r\ncounteracted.--Labours of the committee in the interim.--Public\r\nanxious for the introduction of the question into parliament.--Message\r\nof Mr. Pitt to the committee concerning it.--Day fixed for the\r\nmotion.--Substance of the debate which followed.--Discussion of the\r\ngeneral question deferred till the next sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time the nature of the Slave Trade had, in consequence of the\r\nlabours of the committee and of their several correspondents, become\r\ngenerally known throughout the kingdom. It had excited a general\r\nattention, and there was among the people a general feeling in behalf of\r\nthe wrongs of Africa. This feeling had also, as may be collected from\r\nwhat has been already mentioned, broken out into language: for not only\r\nhad the traffic become the general subject of conversation, but public\r\nmeetings had taken place, in which it had been discussed, and of which\r\nthe result was, that an application to parliament had been resolved upon\r\nin many places concerning it. By the middle of February not fewer than\r\nthirty-five petitions had been delivered to the Commons, and it was\r\nknown that others were on their way to the same house.\r\n\r\nThis ferment in the public mind, which had shown itself in the public\r\nprints even before the petitions had been resolved upon, had excited the\r\nattention of government. To coincide with the wishes of the people on\r\nthis subject, appeared to those in authority to be a desirable thing. To\r\nabolish the trade, replete as it was with misery, was desirable also;\r\nbut it was so connected with the interest of individuals, and so\r\ninterwoven with the commerce and revenue of the country, that a hasty\r\nabolition of it without a previous inquiry appeared to them to be likely\r\nto be productive of as much misery as good. The king, therefore, by an\r\norder of council dated February the eleventh, 1788, directed that a\r\ncommittee of Privy Council should sit as a board of trade, \"to take into\r\ntheir consideration the present state of the African Trade, particularly\r\nas far as related to the practice and manner of purchasing or obtaining\r\nslaves on the coast of Africa, and the importation and sale thereof,\r\neither in the British colonies and settlements, or in the foreign\r\ncolonies and settlements in America or the West-Indies; and also as far\r\nas related to the effects and consequences of the trade both in Africa\r\nand in the said colonies and settlements, and to the general commerce of\r\nthis kingdom; and that they should report to him in council the result\r\nof their inquiries, with such observations as they might have to offer\r\nthereupon.\"\r\n\r\nOf this order of council Mr. Wilberforce, who had attended to this great\r\nsubject, as far as his health would permit, since I left him, had\r\nreceived notice; but he was then too ill himself to take any measures\r\nconcerning it. He therefore wrote to me, and begged of me to repair to\r\nLondon immediately, in order to get such evidence ready as we might\r\nthink it eligible to introduce when the council sat. At that time, as\r\nappears from the former chapter, I had finished the additions to my\r\n_Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species_, and I had now\r\nproceeded about half way in that of the Impolicy of it. This summons,\r\nhowever, I obeyed, and returned to town on the fourteenth of February,\r\nfrom which day to the twenty-fourth of May I shall now give the history\r\nof our proceedings.\r\n\r\nMy first business in London was to hold a conversation with Mr. Pitt\r\npreviously to the meeting of the council, and to try to interest him, as\r\nthe first minister of state, in our favour. For this purpose Mr.\r\nWilberforce had opened the way for me, and an interview took place. We\r\nwere in free conversation together for a considerable time, during which\r\nwe went through most of the branches of the subject. Mr. Pitt appeared\r\nto me to have but little knowledge of it. He had also his doubts, which\r\nhe expressed openly, on many points. He was at a loss to conceive how\r\nprivate interest should not always restrain the master of the slave from\r\nabusing him. This matter I explained to him as well as I could; and if\r\nhe was not entirely satisfied with my interpretation of it, he was at\r\nleast induced to believe that cruel practices were more probable than he\r\nhad imagined. A second circumstance, of the truth of which he doubted,\r\nwas the mortality and usage of seamen in this trade; and a third was the\r\nstatement by which so much had been made of the riches of Africa, and of\r\nthe genius and abilities of her people; for he seemed at a loss to\r\ncomprehend, if these things were so, how it happened that they should\r\nnot have been more generally noticed before. I promised to satisfy him\r\nupon these points, and an interview was fixed for this purpose the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed, I went with my books, papers, and African\r\nproductions. Mr. Pitt examined the former himself. He turned over leaf\r\nafter leaf, in which the copies of the muster-rolls were contained, with\r\ngreat patience; and when he had looked over above a hundred pages\r\naccurately, and found the name of every seaman inserted, his former\r\nabode or service, the time of his entry, and what had become of him,\r\neither by death, discharge, or desertion, he expressed his surprise at\r\nthe great pains which had been taken in this branch of the inquiry; and\r\nconfessed, with some emotion, that his doubts were wholly removed with\r\nrespect to the destructive nature of this employ; and he said, moreover,\r\nthat the facts contained in these documents, if they had been but fairly\r\ncopied, could never be disproved. He was equally astonished at the\r\nvarious woods and other productions of Africa, but most of all at the\r\nmanufactures of the natives in cotton, leather, gold, and iron, which\r\nwere laid before him. These he handled and examined over and over again.\r\nMany sublime thoughts seemed to rush in upon him at once at the sight of\r\nthese, some of which he expressed with observations becoming a great and\r\na dignified mind. He thanked me for the light I had given him on many of\r\nthe branches of this great question. And I went away under a certain\r\nconviction that I had left him much impressed in our favour.\r\n\r\nMy next visit was to Mr. (afterwards Lord) Grenville. I called upon him\r\nat the request of Mr. Wilberforce, who had previously written to him\r\nfrom Bath, as he had promised to attend the meetings of the privy\r\ncouncil during the examinations which were to take place. I found, in\r\nthe course of our conversation, that Mr. Grenville had not then more\r\nknowledge of the subject than Mr. Pitt; but I found him differently\r\ncircumstanced in other respects, for I perceived in him a warm feeling\r\nin behalf of the injured Africans, and that he had no doubt of the\r\npossibility of all the barbarities which had been alleged against this\r\ntraffic. I showed him all my papers and some of my natural productions,\r\nwhich he examined. I was with him the next day, and once again\r\nafterwards, so that the subject was considered in all its parts. The\r\neffect of this interview with him was of course different from that upon\r\nthe minister. In the former case I had removed doubts, and given birth\r\nto an interest in favour of our cause. But I had here only increased an\r\ninterest, which had already been excited, I had only enlarged the mass\r\nof feeling, or added zeal to zeal, or confirmed resolutions and\r\nreasonings. Disposed in this manner originally himself, and strengthened\r\nby the documents with which I had furnished him, Mr. Grenville\r\ncontracted an enmity to the Slave Trade, which was never afterwards\r\ndiminished[A].\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: I have not mentioned the difference between these two\r\neminent persons, with a view of drawing any invidious comparisons, but\r\nbecause, as these statements are true, such persons as have a high\r\nopinion of the late Mr. Pitt's judgment, may see that this great man did\r\nnot espouse the cause hastily, or merely as a matter of feeling, but\r\nupon the conviction of his own mind.]\r\n\r\nA report having gone abroad that the committee of privy council would\r\nonly examine those who were interested in the continuance of the trade,\r\nI found it necessary to call upon Mr. Pitt again, and to inform him of\r\nit, when I received an assurance that every person whom I chose to send\r\nto the council in behalf of the committee should be heard. This gave\r\nrise to a conversation relative to those witnesses whom we had to\r\nproduce on the side of the abolition. And here I was obliged to disclose\r\nour weakness in this respect. I owned with sorrow that, though I had\r\nobtained specimens and official documents in abundance to prove many\r\nimportant points, yet I had found it difficult to prevail upon persons\r\nto be publicly examined on this subject. The only persons we could then\r\ncount upon, were Mr. Ramsay, Mr. H. Gandy, Mr. Falconbridge, Mr. Newton,\r\nand the Dean of Middleham. There was one, however, who would be a host\r\nof himself, if we could but gain him. I then mentioned Mr. Norris. I\r\ntold Mr. Pitt the nature[A] and value of the testimony which he had\r\ngiven me at Liverpool, and the great zeal he had discovered to serve the\r\ncause. I doubted, however, if he would come to London for this purpose,\r\neven if I wrote to him; for he was intimate with almost all the owners\r\nof slave-vessels in Liverpool, and, living among these, he would not\r\nlike to incur their resentment by taking a prominent part against them.\r\nI therefore entreated Mr. Pitt to send him a summons of council to\r\nattend, hoping that Mr. Norris would then be pleased to come up, as he\r\nwould be enabled to reply to his friends that his appearance had not\r\nbeen voluntary. Mr. Pitt, however, informed me, that a summons from a\r\ncommittee of privy council, sitting as a board, was not binding upon the\r\nsubject; and therefore that I had no other means left, but of writing to\r\nhim, and he desired me to do this by the first post.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: See his evidence, Chap. XVII.]\r\n\r\nThis letter I accordingly wrote, and sent it to my friend William\r\nRathbone, who was to deliver it in person, and to use his own influence\r\nat the same time; but I received for answer, that Mr. Norris was then in\r\nLondon. Upon this I tried to find him out, to entreat him to consent to\r\nan examination before the council. At length I found his address; but\r\nbefore I could see him, I was told by the Bishop of London that he had\r\ncome up as a Liverpool delegate in support of the Slave Trade.\r\nAstonished at this information, I made the bishop acquainted with the\r\ncase, and asked him how it became me to act; for I was fearful lest, by\r\nexposing Mr. Norris, I should violate the rights of hospitality on the\r\none hand, and by not exposing him that I should not do my duty to the\r\ncause I had undertaken on the other. His advice was, that I should see\r\nhim, and ask him to explain the reasons of his conduct. I called upon\r\nhim for this purpose, but he was out. He sent me, however, a letter soon\r\nafterwards, which was full of flattery; and in which, after having paid\r\nhigh compliments to the general force of my arguments, and the general\r\njustice and humanity of my sentiments on this great question, which had\r\nmade a deep impression upon his mind, he had found occasion to differ\r\nfrom me, since we had last parted, on particular points, and that he had\r\ntherefore less reluctantly yielded to the call of becoming a\r\ndelegate,--though notwithstanding he would gladly have declined the\r\noffice if he could have done it with propriety.\r\n\r\nAt length the council began their examinations. Mr. Norris, Lieutenant\r\nMatthews, of the navy, who had just left a slave employ in Africa, and\r\nMr. James Penny, formerly a slave captain, and then interested as a\r\nmerchant in the trade, (which three were the delegates from Liverpool,)\r\ntook possession of the ground first. Mr. Miles, Mr. Weuves, and others,\r\nfollowed them on the same side. The evidence which they gave, as\r\npreviously concerted between themselves, may be shortly represented\r\nthus:--They denied that kidnapping either did or could take place in\r\nAfrica, or that wars were made there for the purpose of procuring\r\nslaves. Having done away these wicked practices from their system, they\r\nmaintained positions which were less exceptionable, as that the natives\r\nof Africa generally became slaves in consequence of having been made\r\nprisoners in just wars, or in consequence of their various crimes. They\r\nthen gave a melancholy picture of the despotism and barbarity of some of\r\nthe African princes, among whom the custom of sacrificing their own\r\nsubjects prevailed. But, of all others, that which was afforded by Mr.\r\nNorris on this ground was the most frightful. The King of Dahomey, he\r\nsaid, sported with the lives of his people in the most wanton manner. He\r\nhad seen at the gates of his palace two piles of heads, like those of\r\nshot in an arsenal. Within the palace, the heads of persons, newly put\r\nto death, were strewed at the distance of a few yards in the passage,\r\nwhich led to his apartment. This custom of human sacrifice by the King\r\nof Dahomey was not on one occasion only, but on many; such as on the\r\nreception of messengers from neighbouring states, or of white merchants,\r\nor on days of ceremonial. But the great carnage was once a year, when\r\nthe poll-tax was paid by his subjects. A thousand persons, at least,\r\nwere sacrificed annually on these different occasions. The great men,\r\ntoo, of the country, cut off a few heads on festival-days. From all\r\nthese particulars the humanity of the Slave Trade was inferred, because\r\nit took away the inhabitants of Africa into lands where no such\r\nbarbarities were known. But the humanity of it was insisted upon by\r\npositive circumstances also; namely, that a great number of the slaves\r\nwere prisoners of war, and that in former times all such were put to\r\ndeath, whereas now they were saved: so that there was a great accession\r\nof happiness to Africa since the introduction of the trade.\r\n\r\nThese statements, and those of others on the same side of the question,\r\nhad a great effect, as may easily be conceived, upon the feelings of\r\nthose of the council who were present. Some of them began immediately to\r\nbe prejudiced against us. There were others who even thought that it was\r\nalmost unnecessary to proceed in the inquiry, for that the trade was\r\nactually a blessing. They had little doubt that all our assertions\r\nconcerning it would be found false. The Bishop of London himself was so\r\nimpressed by these unexpected accounts, that he asked me if\r\nFalconbridge, whose pamphlet had been previously sent by the committee\r\nto every member of the council, was worthy of belief, and if he would\r\nsubstantiate publicly what he had thus written: but these impressions\r\nunfortunately were not confined to those who had been present at the\r\nexaminations. These could not help communicating them to others. Hence,\r\nin all the higher circles (some of which I sometimes used to frequent) I\r\nhad the mortification to hear of nothing but the Liverpool evidence, and\r\nof our own credulity, and of the impositions which had been practised\r\nupon us: of these reports the planters and merchants did not fail to\r\navail themselves. They boasted that they would soon do away all the idle\r\ntales which had been invented against them. They desired the public only\r\nto suspend their judgment till the privy council report should be out,\r\nwhen they would see the folly and wickedness of all our allegations. A\r\nlittle more evidence, and all would be over. On the 22nd of March,\r\nthough the committee council had not then held its sittings more than a\r\nmonth, and these only twice or thrice a week, the following paragraph\r\nwas seen in a morning paper:--\"The report of the committee of privy\r\ncouncil will be ready in a few days. After due examination it appears\r\nthat the major part of the complaints against this trade are\r\nill-founded. Some regulations, however, are expected to take place,\r\nwhich may serve in a certain degree to appease the cause of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nBut while they, who were interested, had produced this outcry against\r\nus, in consequence of what had fallen from their own witnesses in the\r\ncourse of their examinations, they had increased it considerably by the\r\nindustrious circulation of a most artful pamphlet among persons of rank\r\nand fortune at the west end of the metropolis, which was called,\r\n_Scriptural Researches on the Licitness of the Slave Trade_. This they\r\nhad procured to be written by R. Harris, who was then clerk in a\r\nslave-house in Liverpool, but had been formerly a clergyman and a\r\nJesuit. As they had maintained in the first instance, as has been\r\nalready shown, the humanity of the traffic, so, by means of this\r\npamphlet they asserted its consistency with revealed religion. That such\r\na book should have made converts in such an age is surprising; and yet\r\nmany, who ought to have known better, were carried away by it; and we\r\nhad now absolutely to contend, and almost degrade ourselves by doing so,\r\nagainst the double argument of the humanity and the holiness of the\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nBy these means, but particularly by the former, the current of opinion\r\nin particular circles ran against us for the first month, and so strong,\r\nthat it was impossible for us to stem it at once; but as some of the\r\ncouncil recovered from their panic, and their good sense became less\r\nbiassed by their feelings, and they were in a state to hear reason,\r\ntheir prejudices began to subside. It began now to be understood among\r\nthem, that almost all the witnesses were concerned in the continuance of\r\nthe trade. It began to be known also, (for Mr. Pitt and the Bishop of\r\nLondon took care that it should be circulated,) that Mr. Norris had but\r\na short time before furnished me at Liverpool with information, all of\r\nwhich he had concealed[A] from the council, but all of which made for\r\nthe abolition of it. Mr. Devaynes also, a respectable member of\r\nparliament, who had been in Africa, and who had been appealed to by Mr.\r\nNorris, when examined before the privy council, in behalf of his\r\nextraordinary facts, was unable, when summoned, to confirm them to the\r\ndesired extent. From this evidence the council collected, that human\r\nsacrifices were not made on the arrival of White traders, as had been\r\nasserted; that there was no poll-tax in Dahomey at all; and that Mr.\r\nNorris must have been mistaken on these points, for he must have been\r\nthere at the time of the ceremony of watering the graves, when about\r\nsixty persons suffered. This latter custom moreover appeared to have\r\nbeen a religious superstition of the country, such as at Otaheite, or in\r\nBritain in the time of the Druids, and to have had nothing to do with\r\nthe Slave Trade[B]. With respect to prisoners of war, Mr. Devaynes\r\nallowed that the old, the lame, and the wounded, were often put to death\r\non the spot; but this was to save the trouble of bringing them away. The\r\nyoung and the healthy were driven off for sale; but if they were not\r\nsold when offered, they were not killed, but reserved for another\r\nmarket, or became house-slaves to the conquerors. Mr. Devaynes also\r\nmaintained, contrary to the allegations of the others, that a great\r\nnumber of persons were kidnapped in order to be sold to the ships; and\r\nthat the government, where this happened, was not strong enough to\r\nprevent it. But besides these drawbacks from the weight of the testimony\r\nwhich had been given, it began to be perceived by some of the lords of\r\nthe council, that the cruel superstitions which had been described,\r\nobtained only in one or two countries in Africa, and these of\r\ninsignificant extent; whereas at the time, when their minds were carried\r\naway, as it were by their feelings, they had supposed them to attach to\r\nthe whole of that vast continent. They perceived also, that there were\r\ncircumstances related in the evidence by the delegates themselves, by\r\nmeans of which, if they were true, the inhumanity of the trade might be\r\nestablished, and this to their own disgrace. They had all confessed that\r\nsuch slaves, as the White traders refused to buy, were put to death; and\r\nyet that these traders, knowing that this would be the case, had the\r\nbarbarity uniformly to reject those whom it did not suit them to\r\npurchase. Mr. Matthews had rejected one of this description himself,\r\nwhom he saw afterwards destroyed. Mr. Penny had known the refuse thrown\r\ndown Melimba rock. Mr. Norris himself, when certain prisoners of war\r\nwere offered to him for sale, declined buying them because they appeared\r\nunhealthy; and though the king then told him that he would put them to\r\ndeath, he could not be prevailed upon to take them but left them to\r\ntheir hard fate; and he had the boldness to state afterwards, that it\r\nwas his belief that many of them actually suffered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: This was also the case with another witness, Mr. Weuves. He\r\nhad given me accounts, before any stir was made about the Slave Trade,\r\nrelative to it, all of which he kept back when he was examined there.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Being a religion custom, it would still have gone on,\r\nthough the Slave Trade had been abolished: nor could the merchants at\r\nany time have bought off a single victim.]\r\n\r\nThese considerations had the effect of diminishing the prejudices of\r\nsome of the council on this great question: and when this was perceived\r\nto be the case, it was the opinion of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Grenville, and the\r\nBishop of London, that we should send three or four of our own evidences\r\nfor examination, who might help to restore matters to an equilibrium.\r\nAccordingly, Mr. Falconbridge, and some others, all of whom were to\r\nspeak to the African part of the subject, were introduced. These\r\nproduced a certain weight in the opposite scale. But soon after these\r\nhad been examined, Dr. Andrew Spaarman, professor of physic, and\r\ninspector of the museum of the royal academy at Stockholm, and his\r\ncompanion, C.B. Wadstrom, chief director of the assay-office there,\r\narrived in England. These gentlemen had been lately sent to Africa by\r\nthe late king of Sweden, to make discoveries in botany, mineralogy, and\r\nother departments of science. For this purpose the Swedish ambassador at\r\nParis had procured them permission from the French government to visit\r\nthe countries bordering on the Senegal, and had insured them protection\r\nthere. They had been conveyed to the place of their destination, where\r\nthey had remained from August 1787, to the end of January 1788; but\r\nmeeting with obstacles which they had not foreseen, they had left it,\r\nand had returned to Havre de Grace, from whence they had just arrived in\r\nLondon, on their way home. It so happened, that by means of George\r\nHarrison, one of our committee, I fell in unexpectedly with these\r\ngentlemen. I had not long been with them, before I perceived the great\r\ntreasure I had found. They gave me many beautiful specimens of African\r\nproduce. They showed me their journals, which they had regularly kept\r\nfrom day to day. In these I had the pleasure of seeing a number of\r\ncircumstances minuted down, all relating to the Slave Trade, and even\r\ndrawings on the same subject. I obtained a more accurate and\r\nsatisfactory knowledge of the manners and customs of the Africans from\r\nthese, than from all the persons put together whom I had yet seen. I was\r\nanxious, therefore, to take them before the committee of council, to\r\nwhich they were pleased to consent; and as Dr. Spaarman was to leave\r\nLondon in a few days, I procured him an introduction first. His evidence\r\nwent to show, that the natives of Africa lived in a fruitful and\r\nluxuriant country, which supplied all their wants, and that they would\r\nbe a happy people, if it were not for the existence of the Slave Trade.\r\nHe instanced wars which he knew to have been made by the Moors upon the\r\nNegroes, (for they were entered upon wholly at the instigation of the\r\nWhite traders,) for the purpose of getting slaves, and he had the pain\r\nof seeing the unhappy captives brought in on such occasions, and some of\r\nthem in a wounded state. Among them, were many women and children, and\r\nthe women were in great affliction. He saw also the king of Barbesin\r\nsend out his parties on expeditions of a similar kind, and he saw them\r\nreturn with slaves. The king had been made intoxicated on purpose, by\r\nthe French agents, or he would never have consented to the measure. He\r\nstated also, that in consequence of the temptations held out by\r\nslave-vessels coming upon the coast, the natives seized one another in\r\nthe night, when they found opportunity; and even invited others to their\r\nhouses, whom they treacherously detained, and sold at these times; so\r\nthat every enormity was practised in Africa, in consequence of the\r\nexistence of the trade. These specific instances made a proper\r\nimpression upon the lords of the council in their turn; for Dr. Spaarman\r\nwas a man of high character; he possessed the confidence of his\r\nsovereign; he had no interest whatever in giving his evidence on this\r\nsubject, either on one or the other side; his means of information too\r\nhad been large; he had also recorded the facts which had come before\r\nhim, and he had his journal, written in the French language, to produce.\r\nThe tide, therefore, which had run so strongly against us, began now to\r\nturn a little in our favour.\r\n\r\nWhile these examinations were going on, petitions continued to be sent\r\nto the House of Commons, from various parts of the kingdom. No less than\r\none hundred and three were presented in this session. The city of\r\nLondon, though she was drawn the other way by the cries of commercial\r\ninterest, made a sacrifice to humanity and justice: the two universities\r\napplauded her conduct by their own example. Large manufacturing towns,\r\nand whole counties, expressed their sentiments and wishes in a similar\r\nmanner. The Established Church in separate dioceses, and the Quakers and\r\nother dissenters, as separate religious bodies, joined in one voice upon\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\nThe committee, in the interim, were not unmindful of the great work they\r\nhad undertaken, and they continued to forward it in its different\r\ndepartments. They kept up a communication by letter with most of the\r\nworthy persons, who have been mentioned to have written to them, but\r\nparticularly with Brissot and Claviere; from whom they had the\r\nsatisfaction of learning, that a society had at length been established\r\nat Paris, for the abolition of the Slave Trade in France. The learned\r\nMarquis de Condorcet had become the president of it. The virtuous Duc de\r\nla Rochefoucauld and the Marquis de la Fayette had sanctioned it by\r\nenrolling their names as the two first members. Petion, who was placed\r\nafterwards among the mayors of Paris, followed. Women also were not\r\nthought unworthy of being honorary and assistant members of this humane\r\ninstitution; and among these were found the amiable Marchioness of la\r\nFayette, Madame de Poivre, widow of the late intendant of the Isle of\r\nFrance, and Madame Necker, wife of the first minister of state.\r\n\r\nThe new correspondents, who voluntarily offered their services to the\r\ncommittee, during the first part of the period now under consideration,\r\nwere S. Whitcomb, Esq., of Gloucester; the Rev. D. Watson, of Middleton\r\nTyas, Yorkshire; John Murlin, Esq., of High Wycomb; Charles Collins,\r\nEsq., of Swansea; Henry Tudor, Esq., of Sheffield; the Rev. John Hare,\r\nof Lincoln; Samuel Tooker, Esq., of Moorgate, near Rotherham; the Rev.\r\nG. Walker, and Francis Wakefield, Esq., of Nottingham; the Rev. Mr.\r\nHepworth, of Burton-upon-Trent; the Rev. H. Dannett, of St. John's,\r\nLiverpool; the Rev. Dr. Oglander, of New College, Oxford; the Rev. H.\r\nCoulthurst, of Sidney College, Cambridge; R. Selfe, Esq., of\r\nCirencester; Morris Birkbeck, of Hanford, Dorsetshire; William Jepson,\r\nof Lancaster; B. Kaye, of Leeds: John Patison, Esq., of Paisley; J.E.\r\nDolben, Esq., of Northamptonshire; the Rev. Mr. Smith, of Wendover; John\r\nWilkinson, Esq., of Woodford; Samuel Milford, Esq., of Exeter; Peter\r\nLunel, Esq., treasurer of the committee at Bristol; James Pemberton, of\r\nPhiladelphia; and the president of the Society at New York.\r\n\r\nThe letters from new correspondents during the latter part of this\r\nperiod, were the following:--\r\n\r\nOne from Alexander Alison, Esq., of Edinburgh, in which he expressed it\r\nto be his duty to attempt to awaken the inhabitants of Scotland to a\r\nknowledge of the monstrous evil of the Slave Trade, and to form a\r\ncommittee there, to act in union with that of London, in carrying the\r\ngreat object of their institution into effect.\r\n\r\nAnother from Elhanan Winchester, offering the committee one hundred of\r\nhis sermons, which he had preached against the Slave Trade, in Fairfax\r\ncounty, in Virginia, so early as in the year 1774.\r\n\r\nAnother from Dr. Frossard, of Lyons, in which he offered his services\r\nfor the South of France, and desired different publications to be sent\r\nhim, that he might be better qualified to take a part in the promotion\r\nof the cause.\r\n\r\nAnother from Professor Bruns, of Helmstadt, in Germany, in which he\r\ndesired to know the particulars relative to the institution of the\r\ncommittee, as many thousands upon the continent were then beginning to\r\nfeel for the sufferings of the oppressed African race.\r\n\r\nAnother from Rev. James Manning, of Exeter, in which he stated himself\r\nto be authorized by the dissenting ministers of Devon and Cornwall, to\r\nexpress their high approbation of the conduct of the committee, and to\r\noffer their services in the promotion of this great work of humanity and\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nAnother from William Senhouse, Esq., of the island of Barbados. In this\r\nhe gave the particulars of two estates, one of them his own, and the\r\nother belonging to a nobleman, upon each of which the slaves, in\r\nconsequence of humane treatment, had increased by natural population\r\nonly. Another effect of this humane treatment had been, that these\r\nslaves were among the most orderly and tractable in that island. From\r\nthese and other instances he argued, that if the planters would, all of\r\nthem, take proper care of their slaves, their humanity would be repaid\r\nin a few years, by a valuable increase in their property, and they would\r\nnever want supplies from a traffic, which had been so justly condemned.\r\n\r\nTwo others, the one from Travers Hartley, and the other from Alexander\r\nJaffray, Esqrs., both of Dublin, were read. These gentlemen sent certain\r\nresolutions, which had been agreed upon by the chamber of commerce and\r\nby the guild of merchants there, relative to the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade. They rejoiced, in the name of those whom they represented, that\r\nIreland had been unspotted by a traffic, which they held in such deep\r\nabhorrence; and promised, if it should be abolished in England, to take\r\nthe post active measures to prevent it from finding an asylum in the\r\nports of that kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe letters of William Senhouse, and of Travers Hartley, and of\r\nAlexander Jaffray, Esqrs., were ordered to be presented to the committee\r\nof privy council, and copies of them to be left there.\r\n\r\nThe business of the committee having almost daily increased within this\r\nperiod, Dr. Baker and Bennet Langton, Esq., who were the two first to\r\nassist me in my early labours, and who have been mentioned among the\r\nforerunners and coadjutors of the cause, were elected members of it. Dr.\r\nKippis also was added to the list.\r\n\r\nThe honorary and corresponding members, elected within the same period,\r\nwere the Dean of Middleham; T.W. Coke, Esq., member of parliament, of\r\nHolkham, in Norfolk; and the Rev. William Leigh, who has been before\r\nmentioned, of Little Plumstead, in the same county. The latter had\r\npublished several valuable letters in the public papers, under the\r\nsignature of Africanus: these had excited great notice, and done much\r\ngood. The worthy author had now collected them into a publication, and\r\nhad offered the profits of it to the committee. Hence this mark of their\r\nrespect was conferred upon him.\r\n\r\nThe committee ordered a new edition of three thousand of the Dean of\r\nMiddleham's Letters to be printed. Having approved of a manuscript,\r\nwritten by James Field Stanfield, a mariner, containing observations\r\nupon a voyage which he had lately made to the coast of Africa for\r\nslaves, they ordered three thousand of these to be printed also. By this\r\ntime, the subject having been much talked of, and many doubts and\r\ndifficulties having been thrown in the way of the abolition, by persons\r\ninterested in the continuance of the trade, Mr. Ramsay, who has been\r\noften so honourably mentioned, put down upon paper all the objections\r\nwhich were then handed about, and also those answers to each, which he\r\nwas qualified, from his superior knowledge of the subject, to suggest.\r\nThis he did, that the members of the legislature might see the more\r\nintricate parts of the question unravelled, and that they might not be\r\nimposed upon by the spurious arguments which were then in circulation\r\nconcerning it. Observing also the poisonous effect which _The Scriptural\r\nResearches on the Licitness of the Slave Trade_ had produced upon the\r\nminds of many, he wrote an answer on scriptural grounds to that\r\npamphlet. These works were sent to the press, and three thousand copies\r\nof each of them were ordered to be struck off.\r\n\r\nThe committee, in their arrangement of the distribution of their books,\r\nordered NEWTON'S _Thoughts_, and RAMSAY'S _Objections and Answers_, to\r\nbe sent to each member of both houses of parliament.\r\n\r\nThey appointed also three sub-committees for different purposes: one to\r\ndraw up such facts and arguments respecting the Slave Trade, with a view\r\nof being translated into other languages, as should give foreigners a\r\nsuitable knowledge of the subject; another to prepare an answer to\r\ncertain false reports which had been spread relative to the object of\r\ntheir institution, and to procure an insertion of it in the daily\r\npapers; and a third to draw up rules for the government of the society.\r\n\r\nBy the latter end of the month of March, there was an anxious\r\nexpectation in the public, notwithstanding the privy council had taken\r\nup the subject, that some notice should be taken, in the lower house of\r\nparliament, of the numerous petitions which had been presented there.\r\nThere was the same expectation in many of the members of it themselves.\r\nLord Penrhyn, one of the representatives for Liverpool, and a planter\r\nalso, had anticipated this notice, by moving for such papers relative to\r\nships employed, goods exported, produce imported, and duties upon the\r\nsame, as would show the vast value of the trade, which it was in\r\ncontemplation to abolish. But at this time Mr. Wilberforce was ill, and\r\nunable to gratify the expectations which had been thus apparent. The\r\ncommittee, therefore, who partook of the anxiety of the public, knew not\r\nwhat to do. They saw that two-thirds of the session had already passed.\r\nThey saw no hope of Mr. Wilberforce's recovery for some time. Rumours\r\ntoo were afloat, that other members, of whose plans they knew nothing,\r\nand who might even make emancipation their object, would introduce the\r\nbusiness into the house. Thus situated, they waited, as patiently as\r\nthey could, till the 8th of April[A], when they resolved to write to Mr.\r\nWilberforce, to explain to him their fears and wishes, and to submit it\r\nto his consideration, whether, if he were unable himself, he would\r\nappoint some one in whom he could confide, to make some motion in\r\nparliament on the subject.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Brissot attended in person at this committee in his way to\r\nAmerica, which it was then an object with him to visit.]\r\n\r\nBut the public expectation became now daily more visible. The\r\ninhabitants of Manchester, many of whom had signed the petition for that\r\nplace, became impatient, and they appointed Thomas Walker and Thomas\r\nCooper, Esquires, as their delegates, to proceed to London to\r\ncommunicate with the committee on this subject, to assist them in their\r\ndeliberations upon it, and to give their attendance while it was under\r\ndiscussion by the legislature.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the arrival of the delegates, who were received as such\r\nby the committee, a letter came from Bath, in which it was stated that\r\nMr. Wilberforce's health was in such a precarious state, that his\r\nphysicians dared not allow him to read any letter which related to the\r\nsubject of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nThe committee were now again at a loss how to act, when they were\r\nrelieved from this doubtful situation by a message from Mr. Pitt, who\r\ndesired a conference with their chairman. Mr. Sharp accordingly went,\r\nand on his return made the following report: \"He had a full\r\nopportunity,\" he said, \"of explaining to Mr. Pitt that the desire of the\r\ncommittee went to the entire abolition of the Slave Trade. Mr. Pitt\r\nassured him that his heart was with the committee as to this object, and\r\nthat he considered himself pledged to Mr. Wilberforce, that the cause\r\nshould not sustain any injury from his indisposition; but at the same\r\ntime observed, that the subject was of great political importance, and\r\nit was requisite to proceed in it with temper and prudence. He did not\r\napprehend, as the examinations before the privy council would yet take\r\nup some time, that the subject could be fully investigated in the\r\npresent session of parliament; but said he would consider whether the\r\nforms of the house would admit of any measures that would be obligatory\r\non them to take it up early in the ensuing session.\"\r\n\r\nIn about a week after this conference, Mr. Morton Pitt was deputed by\r\nthe minister to write to the committee, to say that he had found\r\nprecedents for such a motion as he conceived to be proper, and that he\r\nwould submit it to the House of Commons in a few days.\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting, which was on the 6th of May, and at which Major\r\nCartwright and the Manchester delegates assisted, Mr. Morton Pitt\r\nattended as a member of the committee, and said that the minister had\r\nfixed his motion for the 9th. It was then resolved, that deputations\r\nshould be sent to some of the leading members of parliament, to request\r\ntheir support of the approaching motion. I was included in one of these,\r\nand in that which was to wait upon Mr. Fox. We were received by him in a\r\nfriendly manner. On putting the question to him, which related to the\r\nobject of our mission, Mr. Fox paused for a little while, as if in the\r\nact of deliberation; when he assured us unequivocally, and in language\r\nwhich could not be misunderstood, that he would support the object of\r\nthe committee to its fullest extent, being convinced that there was no\r\nremedy for the evil, but in the total abolition of the trade.\r\n\r\nAt length, the 9th, or the day fixed upon, arrived, when this important\r\nsubject was to be mentioned in the House of Commons for the first\r\ntime[A], with a view to the public discussion of it. It is impossible\r\nfor me to give, within the narrow limits of this work, all that was then\r\nsaid upon it; and yet as the debate which ensued was the first which\r\ntook place upon it, I should feel inexcusable if I were not to take some\r\nnotice of it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: David Hartley made a motion some years before in the same\r\nhouse, as has been shown in a former part of this work; but this was\r\nonly to establish a proposition, That the Slave Trade was contrary to\r\nthe Laws of God and the Rights of Man.]\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt rose. He said he intended to move a resolution relative to a\r\nsubject which was of more importance than any which had ever been\r\nagitated in that house. This honour he should not have had, but for a\r\ncircumstance which he could not but deeply regret, the severe\r\nindisposition of his friend Mr. Wilberforce, in whose hands every\r\nmeasure which belonged to justice, humanity, and the national interest,\r\nwas peculiarly well placed. The subject in question was no less than\r\nthat of the Slave Trade. It was obvious from the great number of\r\npetitions which had been presented concerning it, how much it had\r\nengaged the public attention, and consequently how much it deserved the\r\nserious notice of that house, and how much it became their duty to take\r\nsome measure concerning it. But whatever was done on such a subject,\r\nevery one would agree, ought to be done with the maturest deliberation.\r\nTwo opinions had prevailed without doors, as appeared from the language\r\nof the different petitions. It had been pretty generally thought that\r\nthe African Slave Trade ought to be abolished. There were others,\r\nhowever, who thought that it only stood in need of regulations. But all\r\nhad agreed that it ought not to remain as it stood at present. But that\r\nmeasure which it might be the most proper to take, could only be\r\ndiscovered by a cool, patient, and diligent examination of the subject\r\nin all its circumstances, relations, and consequences. This had induced\r\nhim to form an opinion that the present was not the proper time for\r\ndiscussing it; for the session was now far advanced, and there was also\r\na want of proper materials for the full information of the house. It\r\nwould, he thought, be better discussed, when it might produce some\r\nuseful debate, and when that inquiry which had been instituted by His\r\nMajesty's Ministers, (he meant the examination by a committee of privy\r\ncouncil,) should be brought to such a state of maturity as to make it\r\nfit that the result of it should be laid before the house. That inquiry,\r\nhe trusted, would facilitate their investigation, and enable them the\r\nbetter to proceed to a decision which should be equally founded on\r\nprinciples of humanity, justice, and sound policy. As there was not a\r\nprobability of reaching so desirable an end in the present state of the\r\nbusiness, he meant to move a resolution to pledge the house to the\r\ndiscussion of the question early in the next  session. If by that time\r\nhis honourable friend should be recovered, which he hoped would be the\r\ncase, then he (Mr. Wilberforce) would take the lead in it; but should it\r\nunfortunately happen otherwise, then he (the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer) pledged himself to bring forward some proposition concerning\r\nit. The house, however, would observe, that he had studiously avoided\r\ngiving any opinion of his own on this great subject. He thought it wiser\r\nto defer this till the time of the discussion should arrive. He\r\nconcluded with moving, after having read the names of the places from\r\nwhence the different petitions had come, \"That this house will, early in\r\nthe next session of parliament, proceed to take into consideration the\r\ncircumstances of the Slave Trade complained of in the said petitions,\r\nand what may be fit to be done thereupon.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fox began by observing, that he had long taken an interest in this\r\ngreat subject, which he had also minutely examined, and that it was his\r\nintention to have brought something forward himself in parliament\r\nrespecting it; but when he heard that Mr. Wilberforce had resolved to\r\ntake it up, he was unaffectedly rejoiced, not only knowing the purity of\r\nhis principles and character, but because, from a variety of\r\nconsiderations as to the situations in which different men stood in the\r\nhouse, there was something that made him honestly think it was better\r\nthat the business should be in the hands of that gentleman than in his\r\nown. Having premised this, he said that, as so many petitions, and these\r\nsigned by such numbers of persons of the most respectable character, had\r\nbeen presented, he was sorry that it had been found impossible that the\r\nsubject of them could be taken up this year, and more particularly as he\r\nwas not able to see, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had done, that\r\nthere were circumstances, which might happen by the next year, which\r\nwould make it more advisable and advantageous to take it up then, than\r\nit would have been to enter upon it in the present session. For\r\ncertainly there could be no information laid before the house, through\r\nthe medium of the lords of the council, which could not more\r\nadvantageously have been obtained by themselves, had they instituted a\r\nsimilar inquiry. It was their duty to advise the king, and not to ask\r\nhis advice. This the constitution had laid down as one of its most\r\nessential principles; and though in the present instance he saw no cause\r\nfor blame, because he was persuaded His Majesty's Ministers had not\r\nacted with any ill intention, it was still a principle never to be\r\ndeparted from, because it never could be departed from without\r\nestablishing a precedent which might lead to very serious abuses. He\r\nlamented that the privy council, who had received no petitions from the\r\npeople on the subject, should have instituted an inquiry, and that the\r\nHouse of Commons, the table of which had been loaded with petitions from\r\nvarious parts of the kingdom, should not have instituted any inquiry at\r\nall. He hoped these petitions would have a fair discussion in that\r\nhouse, independently of any information that could be given to it by His\r\nMajesty's Ministers. He urged again the superior advantage of an inquiry\r\ninto such a subject carried on within those walls over any inquiry\r\ncarried on by the lords of the council. In inquiries carried on in that\r\nhouse, they had the benefit of every circumstance of publicity; which\r\nwas a most material benefit indeed, and that which of all others made\r\nthe manner of conducting the parliamentary proceedings of Great Britain\r\nthe envy and the admiration of the world. An inquiry there was better\r\nthan an inquiry in any other place, however respectable the persons\r\nbefore and by whom it was carried on. There, all that could be said for\r\nthe abolition or against it might be said. In that house every relative\r\nfact would have been produced, no information would have been withheld,\r\nno circumstance would have been omitted, which was necessary for\r\nelucidation; nothing would have been kept back. He was sorry, therefore,\r\nthat the consideration of the question, but more particularly where so\r\nmuch human suffering was concerned, should be put off to another\r\nsession, when it was obvious that no advantage could be gained by the\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nHe then adverted to the secrecy which the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nhad observed relative to his own opinion on this important subject. Why\r\ndid he refuse to give it? Had Mr. Wilberforce been present, the house\r\nwould have had a great advantage in this respect, because doubtless he\r\nwould have stated in what view he saw the subject, and in a general way\r\ndescribed the nature of the project he meant to propose. But now they\r\nwere kept in the dark as to the nature of any plan, till the next\r\nsession. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had indeed said, that it had\r\nbeen a very general opinion that the African Slave Trade should be\r\nabolished. He had said again, that others had not gone so far, but had\r\ngiven it as their opinion, that it required to be revised and regulated.\r\nBut why did he not give his own sentiments boldly to the world on this\r\ngreat question? As for himself, he (Mr. Fox) had no scruple to declare\r\nat the outset, that the Slave Trade ought not to be regulated, but\r\ndestroyed. To this opinion his mind was made up; and he was persuaded\r\nthat, the more the subject was considered, the more his opinion would\r\ngain ground; and it would be admitted, that to consider it in any other\r\nmanner, or on any other principles than those of humanity and justice,\r\nwould be idle and absurd. If there were any such men, and he did not\r\nknow but that there were those, who, led away by local and interested\r\nconsiderations, thought the Slave Trade might still continue under\r\ncertain modifications, these were the dupes of error, and mistook what\r\nthey thought their interest, for what he would undertake to convince\r\nthem was their loss. Let such men only hear the case further, and they\r\nwould find the result to be, that a cold-hearted policy was folly when\r\nit opposed the great principles of humanity and justice.\r\n\r\nHe concluded by saying that he would not oppose the resolution, if other\r\nmembers thought it best to postpone the consideration of the subject;\r\nbut he should have been better pleased if it had been discussed sooner;\r\nand he certainly reserved to himself the right of voting for any\r\nquestion upon it that should be brought forward by any other member in\r\nthe course of the present session.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said, that nothing he had heard had\r\nsatisfied him of the propriety of departing from the rule he had laid\r\ndown for himself, of not offering, but of studiously avoiding to offer,\r\nany opinion upon the subject till the time should arrive when it could\r\nbe fully argued. He thought that no discussion which could take place\r\nthat session, could lead to any useful measure, and therefore, he had\r\nwished not to argue it till the whole of it could be argued. A day would\r\ncome, when every member would have an opportunity of stating his\r\nopinion; and he wished it might be discussed with a proper spirit on all\r\nsides, on fair and liberal principles, and without any shackles from\r\nlocal and interested considerations.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the inquiries instituted before the committee of privy\r\ncouncil, he was sure, as soon as it became obvious that the subject must\r\nundergo a discussion, it was the duty of His Majesty's Ministers to set\r\nthose inquiries on foot, which should best enable them to judge in what\r\nmanner they could meet or offer any proposition respecting the Slave\r\nTrade. And although such previous examinations by no means went to\r\ndeprive that house of its undoubted right to institute those inquiries;\r\nor to preclude them, they would be found greatly to facilitate them.\r\nBut, exclusive of this consideration, it would have been utterly\r\nimpossible to have come to any discussion of the subject, that could\r\nhave been brought to a conclusion in the course of the present session.\r\nDid the inquiry then before the privy council prove a loss of time? So\r\nfar from it, that, upon the whole, time had been gained by it. He had\r\nmoved the resolution, therefore, to pledge the house to bring on the\r\ndiscussion early in the next session, when they would have a full\r\nopportunity of considering every part of the subject: first, whether the\r\nwhole of the trade ought to be abolished; and, if so, how and when. If\r\nit should be thought that the trade should only be put under certain\r\nregulations, what those regulations ought to be, and when they should\r\ntake place. These were questions which must be considered; and therefore\r\nhe had made his resolution as wide as possible, that there might be room\r\nfor all necessary considerations to be taken in. He repeated his\r\ndeclaration, that he would reserve his sentiments till the day of\r\ndiscussion should arrive; and again declared, that he earnestly wished\r\nto avoid an anticipation of the debate upon the subject. But if such\r\ndebate was likely to take place, he would withdraw his motion, and offer\r\nit another day.\r\n\r\nA few words then passed between Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox in reply to each\r\nother; after which Lord Penrhyn rose. He said there were two classes of\r\nmen, the African merchants, and the planters, both of whose characters\r\nhad been grossly calumniated. These wished that an inquiry might be\r\ninstituted, and this immediately, conscious that the more their conduct\r\nwas examined the less they would be found to merit the opprobrium with\r\nwhich they had been loaded. The charges against the Slave Trade were\r\neither true or false. If they were true, it ought to be abolished; but\r\nif upon inquiry they were found to be without foundation, justice ought\r\nto be done to the reputation of those who were concerned in it. He then\r\nsaid a few words, by which he signified, that, after all, it might not\r\nbe an improper measure to make regulations in the trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke said, the noble lord, who was a man of honour himself, had\r\nreasoned from his own conduct, and, being conscious of his own\r\nintegrity, was naturally led to imagine that other men were equally just\r\nand honourable. Undoubtedly the merchants and planters had a right to\r\ncall for an investigation of their conduct, and their doing so did them\r\ngreat credit. The Slave Trade also ought equally to be inquired into.\r\nNeither did he deny that it was right his Majesty's ministers should\r\ninquire into its merits for themselves. They had done their duty; but\r\nthat House, who had the petitions of the people on their table,\r\nneglected it, by having so long deferred an inquiry of their own. If\r\nthat House wished to preserve their functions, their understandings,\r\ntheir honour, and their dignity, he advised them to beware of committees\r\nof privy council. If they suffered their business to be done by such\r\nmeans, they were abdicating their trust and character, and making way\r\nfor an entire abolition of their functions, which they were parting with\r\none after another, Thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Star after star goes out, and all is night.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf they neglected the petitions of their constituents, they must fall,\r\nand the privy-counsel be instituted in their stead. What would be the\r\nconsequence? His Majesty's Ministers, instead of consulting them, and\r\ngiving them the opportunity of exercising their functions of\r\ndeliberation and legislation, would modify the measures of government\r\nelsewhere, and bring down the edicts of the privy council to them to\r\nregister. Mr. Burke said, he was one of those who wished for the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade. He thought it ought to be abolished, on\r\nprinciples of humanity and justice. If, however, opposition of interests\r\nshould render its total abolition impossible, it ought to be regulated,\r\nand that immediately. They need not send to the West Indies to know the\r\nopinions of the planters on the subject. They were to consider first of\r\nall, and abstractedly from all political, personal, and local\r\nconsiderations, that the Slave Trade was directly contrary to the\r\nprinciples of humanity and justice, and to the spirit of the British\r\nconstitution; and that the state of slavery, which followed it, however\r\nmitigated, was a state so improper, so degrading, and so ruinous to the\r\nfeelings and capacities of human nature, that it ought not to be\r\nsuffered to exist. He deprecated delay in this business, as well for the\r\nsake of planters as of the slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. Gascoyne, the other member for Liverpool, said he had no objection\r\nthat the discussion should stand over to the next session of parliament,\r\nprovided it could not come on in the present, because he was persuaded\r\nit would ultimately be found that his constituents, who were more\r\nimmediately concerned in the trade, and who had been so shamefully\r\ncalumniated, were men of respectable character. He hoped the privy\r\ncouncil would print their Report when they had brought their inquiries\r\nto a conclusion, and that they would lay it before the House and the\r\npublic, in order to enable all concerned to form a judgment of what was\r\nproper to be done relative to the subject next session. With respect,\r\nhowever, to the total abolition of the Slave Trade, he must confess that\r\nsuch a measure was both unnecessary, visionary, and impracticable; but\r\nhe wished some alterations or modifications to be adopted. He hoped\r\nthat, when the House came to go into the general question, they would\r\nnot forget the trade, commerce, and navigation of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Rolle said, he had received instruction from his constituents to\r\ninquire if the grievances, which had been alleged to result from the\r\nSlave Trade, were well founded; and, if it appear that they were, to\r\nassist in applying a remedy. He was glad the discussion had been put off\r\ntill next session, as it would give all of them an opportunity of\r\nconsidering the subject with more mature deliberation.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin desired to say a few words only. He put the case, that,\r\nsupposing the slaves were treated ever so humanely, when they were\r\ncarried to the West Indies, what compensation could be made them for\r\nbeing torn from their nearest relations, and from everything that was\r\ndear to them in life? He hoped no political advantage, no national\r\nexpediency, would be allowed to weigh in the scale against the eternal\r\nrules of moral rectitude. As for himself, he had no hesitation to\r\ndeclare, in this early stage of the business, that he should think\r\nhimself a wicked wretch if he did not do everything in his power to put\r\na stop to the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nSir William Dolben said, that he did not then wish to enter into the\r\ndiscussion of the general question of the abolition of the Slave Trade,\r\nwhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer was so desirous of postponing; but\r\nhe wished to say a few words on what he conceived to be a most crying\r\nevil, and which might be immediately remedied, without infringing upon\r\nthe limits of that question. He did not allude to the sufferings of the\r\npoor Africans in their own country, nor afterwards in the West India\r\nislands, but to that intermediate state of tenfold misery which they\r\nunderwent in their transportation. When put on board the ships, the poor\r\nunhappy wretches were chained to each other, hand and foot, and stowed\r\nso close, that they were not allowed above a foot and a half for each\r\nindividual in breadth. Thus crammed together like herrings in a barrel,\r\nthey contracted putrid and fatal disorders; so that they who came to\r\ninspect them in a morning had occasionally to pick dead slaves out of\r\ntheir rows, and to unchain their carcasses from the bodies of their\r\nwretched fellow-sufferers, to whom they had been fastened. Nor was it\r\nmerely to the slaves that the baneful effects of the contagion thus\r\ncreated were confined. This contagion affected the ships' crews, and\r\nnumbers of the seamen employed in the horrid traffic perished. This\r\nevil, he said, called aloud for a remedy, and that remedy ought to be\r\napplied soon; otherwise no less than ten thousand lives might be lost\r\nbetween this and next session. He wished therefore this grievance to be\r\ntaken into consideration, independently of the general question; and\r\nthat some regulations, such as restraining the captains from taking\r\nabove a certain number of slaves on board, according to the size of\r\ntheir vessels, and obliging them to let in fresh air, and provide better\r\naccommodation for the slaves during their passage, should be adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. Young wished the consideration of the whole subject to stand over to\r\nthe next session.\r\n\r\nSir James Johnstone, though a planter, professed himself a friend to the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade. He said it was highly necessary that the\r\nHouse should do something respecting it; but whatever was to be done\r\nshould be done soon, as delay might be productive of bad consequences in\r\nthe islands.\r\n\r\nMr. L. Smith stood up a zealous advocate for the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade. He said that even Lord Penrhyn and Mr. Gascoyne, the members for\r\nLiverpool, had admitted the evil of it to a certain extent; for\r\nregulations or modifications, in which they seemed to acquiesce, were\r\nunnecessary where abuses did not really exist.\r\n\r\nMr. Grigby thought it his duty to declare, that no privy council report,\r\nor other mode of examination, could influence him. A traffic in the\r\npersons of men was so odious, that it ought everywhere, as soon as ever\r\nit was discovered, to be abolished.\r\n\r\nMr. Bastard was anxious that the House should proceed to the discussion\r\nof the subject in the present session. The whole country, he said, had\r\npetitioned; and was it any satisfaction to the country to be told, that\r\nthe committee of privy council were inquiring? Who knew anything of what\r\nwas doing by the committee of privy council, or what progress they were\r\nmaking? The inquiry ought to have been instituted in that House, and in\r\nthe face of the public, that everybody concerned might know what was\r\ngoing on. The numerous petitions of the people ought immediately to be\r\nattended to. He reprobated delay on this occasion; and as the honourable\r\nbaronet, Sir William Dolben, had stated facts which were shocking to\r\nhumanity, he hoped he would move that a committee might be appointed to\r\ninquire into their existence, that a remedy might be applied, if\r\npossible, before the sailing of the next ships for Africa.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitbread professed himself a strenuous advocate for the total and\r\nimmediate abolition of the Slave Trade. It was contrary to nature, and\r\nto every principle of justice, humanity, and religion.\r\n\r\nMr. Pelham stated, that he had very maturely considered the subject of\r\nthe Slave Trade; and had he not known that the business was in the hands\r\nof an honourable member, (whose absence from the house, and the cause of\r\nit, no man lamented more sincerely than he did,) he should have ventured\r\nto propose something concerning it himself. If it should be thought that\r\nthe trade ought not to be entirely done away, the sooner it was\r\nregulated the better. He had a plan for this purpose, which appeared to\r\nhim to be likely to produce some salutary effects. He wished to know if\r\nany such thing would be permitted to be proposed in the course of the\r\npresent session.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said he should be happy, if he thought\r\nthe circumstances of the house were such as to enable them to proceed to\r\nan immediate discussion of the question; but as that did not appear,\r\nfrom the reasons he had before stated, to be the case, he could only\r\nassure the honourable gentleman, that the same motives which had induced\r\nhim to propose an inquiry into the subject early in the next session of\r\nparliament, would make him desirous of receiving any other light which\r\ncould be thrown upon it.\r\n\r\nThe question having been then put, the resolution was agreed to\r\nunanimously. Thus ended the first debate that ever took place in the\r\nCommons, on this important subject. This debate, though many of the\r\npersons concerned in it abstained cautiously from entering into the\r\nmerits of the general question, became interesting, in consequence of\r\ncircumstances attending it. Several rose up at once to give relief, as\r\nit were, to their feelings by utterance; but by so doing they were\r\nprevented, many of them, from being heard. They who were heard, spoke\r\nwith peculiar energy, as if warmed in an extraordinary manner by the\r\nsubject. There was an apparent enthusiasm in behalf of the injured\r\nAfricans. It was supposed by some, that there was a moment, in which, if\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had moved for an immediate abolition of\r\nthe trade, he would have carried it that night; and both he and others,\r\nwho professed an attachment to the cause, were censured for not having\r\ntaken a due advantage of the disposition which was so apparent. But\r\nindependently of the inconsistency of doing this on the part of the\r\nministry, while the privy council were in the midst of their inquiries,\r\nand of the improbability that the other branches of the legislature\r\nwould have concurred in so hasty a measure; what good would have accrued\r\nto the cause, if the abolition had been then carried? Those concerned in\r\nthe cruel system would never have rested quietly under the stigma under\r\nwhich they then laboured. They would have urged, that they had been\r\ncondemned unheard. The merchants would have said, that they had had no\r\nnotice of such an event, that they might prepare, a way for their\r\nvessels in other trades. The planters would have said, that they had had\r\nno time allowed them to provide such supplies from Africa as might\r\nenable them to keep up their respective stocks. They would, both of\r\nthem, have called aloud for immediate indemnification. They would have\r\ndecried the policy of the measure of the abolition; and where had it\r\nbeen proved? They would have demanded a reverse of it; and might they\r\nnot in cooler moments have succeeded? Whereas, by entering into a\r\npatient discussion of the merits of the question; by bringing evidence\r\nupon it; by reasoning upon that evidence night after night, and year\r\nafter year, and thus by disputing the ground inch as it were by inch,\r\nthe abolition of the Slave Trade stands upon a rock, upon which it never\r\ncan be shaken. Many of those who were concerned in the cruel system have\r\nnow given up their prejudices, because they became convinced in the\r\ncontest. A stigma too has been fixed upon it, which can never be erased:\r\nand in a large record, in which the cruelty and injustice of it have\r\nbeen recognised in indelible characters, its impolicy also has been\r\neternally enrolled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nContinuation to the middle of July.--Anxiety of Sir William Dolben to\r\nlessen the horrors of the Middle Passage till the great question\r\nshould be discussed; brings in a bill for that purpose; debate upon\r\nit.--Evidence examined against it; its inconsistency and\r\nfalsehoods.--Further debate upon it.--Bill passed, and carried to the\r\nLords; vexatious delays and opposition there; carried backwards and\r\nforwards to both houses.--At length finally passed.--Proceedings of\r\nthe committee in the interim; effects of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was supposed, after the debate, of which the substance has been just\r\ngiven, that there would have been no further discussion of the subject\r\ntill the next year; but Sir William Dolben became more and more affected\r\nby those considerations which he had offered to the house on the ninth\r\nof May. The trade, he found, was still to go on. The horrors of the\r\ntransportation, or Middle Passage, as it was called, which he conceived\r\nto be the worst in the long catalogue of evils belonging to the system,\r\nwould of course accompany it. The partial discussion of these, he\r\nbelieved, would be no infringement of the late resolution of the house.\r\nHe was desirous, therefore, of doing something in the course of the\r\npresent session, by which the miseries of the trade might be diminished\r\nas much as possible, while it lasted, or till the legislature could take\r\nup the whole of the question. This desire he mentioned to several of his\r\nfriends; and as these approved of his design, he made it known on the\r\ntwenty-first of May in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nHe began by observing, that he would take up but little of their time.\r\nHe rose to move for leave to bring in a bill for the relief of those\r\nunhappy persons, the natives of Africa, from the hardships to which they\r\nwere usually exposed in their passage from the coast of Africa to the\r\ncolonies. He did not mean, by any regulations he might introduce for\r\nthis purpose, to countenance or sanction the Slave Trade, which, however\r\nmodified, would be always wicked and unjustifiable. Nor did he mean, by\r\nintroducing these, to go into the general question which the house had\r\nprohibited. The bill which he had in contemplation, went only to limit\r\nthe number of persons to be put on board to the tonnage of the vessel\r\nwhich was to carry them, in order to prevent them from being crowded too\r\nclosely together; to secure to them good and sufficient provisions; and\r\nto take cognizance of other matters, which related to their health and\r\naccommodation; and this only till parliament could enter into the\r\ngeneral merits of the question. This humane interference he thought no\r\nmember would object to. Indeed, those for Liverpool had both of them\r\nadmitted, on the ninth of May, that regulations were desirable; and he\r\nhad since conversed with them, and was happy to learn that they would\r\nnot oppose him on this occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitbread highly approved of the object of the worthy baronet, which\r\nwas to diminish the sufferings of an unoffending people. Whatever could\r\nbe done to relieve them in their hard situation, till parliament could\r\ntake up the whole of their case, ought to be done by men living in a\r\ncivilized country, and professing the Christian religion: he therefore\r\nbegged leave to second the motion which had been made.\r\n\r\nGeneral Norton was sorry that he had not risen up sooner. He wished to\r\nhave seconded this humane motion himself. It had his most cordial\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nMr. Burgess complimented the worthy baronet on the honour he had done\r\nhimself on this occasion, and congratulated the house on the good, which\r\nthey were likely to do by acceding, as he was sure they would, to his\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Joliffe rose, and said that the motion in question should have his\r\nstrenuous support.\r\n\r\nMr. Gascoyne stated, that having understood from the honourable baronet\r\nthat he meant only to remedy the evils, which were stated to exist in\r\ntransporting the inhabitants of Africa to the West Indies, he had told\r\nthem that he would not object to the introduction of such a bill. Should\r\nit however interfere with the general question, the discussion of which\r\nhad been prohibited, he would then oppose it. He must also reserve\r\nanother case for his opposition; and this would be, if the evils of\r\nwhich it took cognizance should appear not to have been well founded. He\r\nhad written to his constituents to be made acquainted with this\r\ncircumstance, and he must be guided by them on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin was surprised how any person could give an opposition to such\r\na bill. Whatever were the merits of the great question, all would allow,\r\nthat if human beings were to be transported across the ocean, they\r\nshould be carried over with as little suffering as possible to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton deprecated the subdivision of this great and important\r\nquestion, which the house had reserved for another session. Every\r\nendeavour to meddle with one part of it, before the whole of it could be\r\ntaken into consideration, looked rather as if it came from an enemy than\r\nfrom a friend. He was fearful that such a bill as this would sanction a\r\ntraffic, which should never be viewed but in a hostile light, or as\r\nrepugnant to the feelings of our nature, and to the voice of our\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nLord Frederic Campbell was convinced that the postponing of all\r\nconsideration of the subject till the next session was a wise measure.\r\nHe was sure that neither the house nor the public were in a temper\r\nsufficiently cool to discuss it properly. There was a general warmth of\r\nfeeling, or an enthusiasm about it, which ran away with the\r\nunderstandings of men, and disqualified them from judging soberly\r\nconcerning it. He wished, therefore, that the present motion might be\r\ndeferred.\r\n\r\nMr. William Smith said, that if the motion of the honourable Baronet had\r\ntrespassed upon the great question reserved for consideration, he would\r\nhave opposed it himself; but he conceived the subject which it\r\ncomprehended might with propriety be separately considered; and if it\r\nwere likely that a hundred, but much more a thousand, lives would be\r\nsaved by this bill, it was the duty of that house to adopt it without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, though he meant still to conceal his\r\nopinion as to the general merits of the question, could not be silent,\r\nhere. He was of opinion that he could very consistently give this motion\r\nhis support. There was a possibility (and a bare possibility was a\r\nsufficient ground with him) that in consequence of the resolution lately\r\ncome to by the house, and the temper then manifested in it, those\r\npersons who were concerned in the Slave Trade might put the natives of\r\nAfrica in a worse situation, during their transportation to the\r\ncolonies, even than they were in before, by cramming additional numbers\r\non board their vessels, in order to convey as many as possible to the\r\nWest Indies before parliament ultimately decided on the subject. The\r\npossibility, therefore, that such a consequence might grow out of their\r\nlate resolution during the intervening months between the end of the\r\npresent and the commencement of the next session, was a good and\r\nsufficient parliamentary ground for them to provide immediate means to\r\nprevent the existence of such an evil. He considered this as an act of\r\nindispensable duty, and on that ground the bill should have his support.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the question was put, and leave was given for the\r\nintroduction of the bill.\r\n\r\nAn account of these proceedings of the house having been sent to the\r\nmerchants of Liverpool, they held a meeting, and came to resolutions on\r\nthe subject. They determined to oppose the bill in every stage in which\r\nit should be brought forward, and, what was extraordinary, even the\r\nprinciple of it. Accordingly, between the 21st of May and the 2nd of\r\nJune, on which latter day the bill having been previously read a second\r\ntime was to be committed, petitions from interested persons had been\r\nbrought against it, and consent had been obtained, that both council and\r\nevidence should be heard.\r\n\r\nThe order of the day having been read on the 2nd of June for the house\r\nto resolve itself into a committee of the whole house, a discussion took\r\nplace relative to the manner in which the business was to be conducted.\r\nThis being over, the counsel began their observations; and, as soon as\r\nthey had finished, evidence was called to the bar in behalf of the\r\npetitions which had been delivered.\r\n\r\nFrom the 2nd of June to the 17th the house continued to hear the\r\nevidence at intervals, but the members for Liverpool took every\r\nopportunity of occasioning delay. They had recourse twice to counting\r\nout the house; and at another time, though complaint had been made of\r\ntheir attempts to procrastinate, they opposed the resuming of their own\r\nevidence with the same view; and this merely for the frivolous reason,\r\nthat, though there was then a suitable opportunity, notice had not been\r\npreviously given. But in this proceeding, other members feeling\r\nindignant at their conduct, they were overruled.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses brought by the Liverpool merchants against this humane\r\nbill were the same as they had before sent for examination to the privy\r\ncouncil, namely, Mr. Norris, Lieutenant Matthews, and others. On the\r\nother side of the question it was not deemed expedient to bring any. It\r\nwas soon perceived that it would be possible to refute the former out of\r\ntheir own mouths, and to do this seemed more eligible than to proceed in\r\nthe other way. Mr. Pitt, however, took care to send Captain Parrey, of\r\nthe Royal Navy, to Liverpool, that he might take the tonnage and\r\ninternal dimensions of several slave-vessels, which were then there,\r\nsupposing that these, when known, would enable the house to detect any\r\nmisrepresentations, which the delegates from that town might be disposed\r\nto make upon this subject.\r\n\r\nIt was the object of the witnesses, when examined, to prove two things:\r\nfirst, that regulations were unnecessary, because the present mode of\r\nthe transportation was sufficiently convenient for the objects of it,\r\nand was well adapted to preserve their comfort and their health. They\r\nhad sufficient room, sufficient air, and sufficient provisions. When\r\nupon deck, they made merry and amused themselves with dancing. As to the\r\nmortality, or the loss of them by death in the course of their passage,\r\nit was trifling. In short, the voyage from Africa to the West Indies\r\n\"was one of the happiest periods of a Negro's life.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, that if the merchants were hindered from taking less that two\r\nfull sized, or three smaller Africans, to a ton, then the restrictions\r\nwould operate not as the regulation, but as the utter ruin of the trade.\r\nHence the present bill, under the specious mask of a temporary\r\ninterference, sought nothing less than its abolition.\r\n\r\nThese assertions having been severally made, by the former of which it\r\nwas insinuated that the African, unhappy in his own country, found in\r\nthe middle passage, under the care of the merchants, little less than an\r\nElysian retreat, it was now proper to institute a severe inquiry into\r\nthe truth of them. Mr. Pitt, Sir Charles Middleton, Mr. William Smith,\r\nand Mr. Beaufoy, took a conspicuous part on this occasion, but\r\nparticularly the two latter, to whom much praise was due for the\r\nconstant attention they bestowed upon this subject. Question after\r\nquestion was put by these to the witnesses; and from their own mouths\r\nthey dragged out, by means of a cross-examination as severe as could be\r\nwell instituted, the following melancholy account:--\r\n\r\nEvery slave, whatever his size might be, was found to have only five\r\nfeet and six inches in length, and sixteen inches in breadth, to lie in.\r\nThe floor was covered with bodies stowed or packed according to this\r\nallowance: but between the floor and the deck or ceiling were often\r\nplatforms or broad shelves in the mid-way, which were covered with\r\nbodies also. The height from the floor to the ceiling, within which\r\nspace the bodies on the floor and those on the platforms lay, seldom\r\nexceeded five feet eight inches, and in some cases it did not exceed\r\nfour feet.\r\n\r\nThe men were chained two and two together by their hands and feet, and\r\nwere chained also by means of ring-bolts, which were fastened to the\r\ndeck. They were confined in this manner at least all the time they\r\nremained upon the coast, which was from six weeks to six months as it\r\nmight happen.\r\n\r\nTheir allowance consisted of one pint of water a day to each person, and\r\nthey were fed twice a day with yams and horsebeans.\r\n\r\nAfter meals they jumped up in their irons for exercise. This was so\r\nnecessary for their health, that they were whipped if they refused to do\r\nit; and this jumping had been termed dancing.\r\n\r\nThey were usually fifteen and sixteen hours below deck out of the\r\ntwenty-four. In rainy weather they could not be brought up for two or\r\nthree days together. If the ship was full, their situation was then\r\ndistressing. They sometimes drew their breath with anxious and laborious\r\nefforts, and some died of suffocation.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their health in these voyages, the mortality, where the\r\nAfrican constitution was the strongest, or on the windward coast, was\r\nonly about five in a hundred. In thirty-five voyages, an account of\r\nwhich was produced, about six in a hundred was the average number lost.\r\nBut this loss was still greater at Calabar and Bonny, which were the\r\ngreatest markets for slaves. This loss, too, did not include those who\r\ndied, either while the vessels were lying upon the Coast, or after their\r\narrival in the West Indies, of the disorders which they had contracted\r\nupon the voyage. Three and four in a hundred had been known to die in\r\nthis latter case.\r\n\r\nBut besides these facts, which were forced out of the witnesses by means\r\nof the cross-examination which took place, they were detected in various\r\nfalsehoods.\r\n\r\nThey had asserted that the ships in this trade were peculiarly\r\nconstructed, or differently from others, in order that they might carry\r\na great number of persons with convenience; whereas Captain Parrey\r\nasserted, that out of the twenty-six, which he had seen, ten only had\r\nbeen built expressly for this employ.\r\n\r\nThey had stated the average height between decks at about five feet and\r\nfour inches. But Captain Parrey showed, that out of the nine he\r\nmeasured, the height in four of the smallest was only four feet eight\r\ninches, and the average height in all of them was but five feet two.\r\n\r\nThey had asserted that vessels under two hundred tons had no platforms.\r\nBut by his account the four just mentioned were of this tonnage, and yet\r\nall of them had platforms either wholly or in part.\r\n\r\nOn other points they were found both to contradict themselves and one\r\nanother. They had asserted, as before mentioned, that if they were\r\nrestricted to less than two full-grown slaves to a ton, the trade would\r\nbe ruined. But in examining into the particulars of nineteen vessels,\r\nwhich they produced themselves, five of them only had cargoes equal to\r\nthe proportion which they stated to be necessary to the existence of the\r\ntrade. The other fourteen carried a less number of slaves (and they\r\nmight have taken more on board if they had pleased); so that the average\r\nnumber in the nineteen was but one man and four-fifths to a ton, or ten\r\nin a hundred below their lowest standard[A]. One again said, that no\r\ninconvenience arose in consequence of the narrow space allowed to each\r\nindividual in these voyages. Another said, that smaller vessels were\r\nmore healthy than larger, because, among other reasons, they had a less\r\nproportion of slaves as to number on board.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The falsehood of their statements in this respect was\r\nproved again afterwards by facts. For, after the regulation had taken\r\nplace, they lost fewer slaves and made greater profits.]\r\n\r\nThey were found also guilty of a wilful concealment of such facts, as\r\nthey knew, if communicated, would have invalidated their own testimony.\r\nI was instrumental in detecting them on one of these occasions myself.\r\nWhen Mr. Dalzell was examined, he was not wholly unknown to me; my\r\nLiverpool muster-rolls told me that he had lost fifteen seamen out of\r\nforty in his last voyage. This was a sufficient ground to go upon; for\r\ngenerally, where the mortality of the seamen has been great, it may be\r\nlaid down that the mortality of the slaves has been considerable also. I\r\nwaited patiently till his evidence was nearly closed, but he had then\r\nmade no unfavourable statements to the house. I desired, therefore, that\r\na question might be put to him, and in such a manner, that he might know\r\nthat they, who put it, had got a clue to his secrets. He became\r\nimmediately embarrassed; his voice faltered; he confessed with trembling\r\nthat he had lost a third of his sailors in his last voyage. Pressed hard\r\nimmediately by other questions, he then acknowledged that he had lost\r\none hundred and twenty, or a third of his slaves, also. But would he say\r\nthat these were all he had lost in that voyage? No; twelve others had\r\nperished by an accident, for they were drowned. But were no others lost\r\nbeside the one hundred and twenty and the twelve? None, he said, upon\r\nthe voyage, but between twenty and thirty before he left the Coast. Thus\r\nthis champion of the merchants, this advocate for the health and\r\nhappiness of slaves in the middle passage, lost nearly a hundred and\r\nsixty of the unhappy persons committed to his superior care, in a single\r\nvoyage!\r\n\r\nThe evidence, on which I have now commented, having been delivered, the\r\ncounsel summed up on the 17th of June, when the committee proceeded to\r\nfill up the blanks in the bill. Mr. Pitt moved that the operation of it\r\nbe retrospective, and that it commence from the 10th instant. This was\r\nviolently opposed by Lord Penrhyn, Mr. Gascoyne, and Mr. Brickdale, but\r\nwas at length acceded to.\r\n\r\nSir William Dolben then proposed to apportion five men to every three\r\ntons in every ship under one hundred and fifty tons burden, which had\r\nthe space of five feet between the decks, and three men to two tons in\r\nevery vessel beyond one hundred and fifty tons burden, which had equal\r\naccommodation in point of height between the decks. This occasioned a\r\nvery warm dispute, which was not settled for some time, and which gave\r\nrise to some beautiful and interesting speeches on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. William Smith pointed out in the clearest manner many of the\r\ncontradictions, which I have just stated in commenting upon the\r\nevidence; indeed he had been a principal means of detecting them. He\r\nproved how little worthy of belief the witnesses had shown themselves,\r\nand how necessary they had made the present bill by their own\r\nconfession. The worthy baronet, indeed, had been too indulgent to the\r\nmerchants, in the proportion he had fixed of the number of persons to be\r\ncarried to the tonnage of their vessels. He then took a feeling view of\r\nwhat would be the wretched state of the poor Africans on board, even if\r\nthe bill passed as it now stood; and conjured the house, if they would\r\nnot allow them more room, at least not to infringe upon that which had\r\nbeen proposed.\r\n\r\nLord Belgrave (afterwards Grosvenor) animadverted with great ability\r\nupon the cruelties of the trade, which he said had been fully proved at\r\nthe bar. He took notice of the extraordinary opposition which had been\r\nmade to the bill then before them, and which he believed every\r\ngentleman, who had a proper feeling of humanity, would condemn. If the\r\npresent mode of carrying on the trade received the countenance of that\r\nhouse, the poor unfortunate African would have occasion doubly to curse\r\nhis fate. He would not only curse the womb that brought him forth, but\r\nthe British nation also, whose diabolical avarice had made his cup of\r\nmisery still more bitter. He hoped that the members for Liverpool would\r\nurge no further opposition to the bill, but that they would join with\r\nthe house in an effort to enlarge the empire of humanity; and that,\r\nwhile they were stretching out the strong arm of justice to punish the\r\ndegraders of British honour and humanity in the East, they would with\r\nequal spirit exert their powers to dispense the blessings of their\r\nprotection to those unhappy Africans, who were to serve them in the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nMr. Beaufoy entered minutely into an examination of the information,\r\nwhich had been given by the witnesses, and which afforded unanswerable\r\narguments for the passing of the bill. He showed the narrow space which\r\nthey themselves had been made to allow for the package of a human body,\r\nand the ingenious measures they were obliged to resort to for stowing\r\nthis living cargo within the limits of the ship. He adverted next to the\r\ncase of Mr. Dalzell, and showed how one dismal fact after another, each\r\nmaking against their own testimony, was extorted from him. He then went\r\nto the trifling mortality said to be experienced in these voyages, upon\r\nwhich subject he spoke in the following words: \"Though the witnesses are\r\nsome of them interested in the trade, and all of them parties against\r\nthe bill, their confession is, that of the negroes of the windward\r\ncoast, who are men of the strongest constitution which Africa affords,\r\nno less on an average than five in each hundred perish in the voyage,--a\r\nvoyage, it must be remembered but of six weeks. In a twelvemonth, then,\r\nwhat must be the proportion of the dead? No less than forty-three in a\r\nhundred, which is seventeen times the usual rate of mortality; for all\r\nthe estimates of life suppose no more than a fortieth of the people, or\r\ntwo and a half in the hundred, to die within the space of a year. Such\r\nthen is the comparison. In the ordinary course of nature the number of\r\npersons, (including those in age and infancy, the weakest periods of\r\nexistence,) who perish in the space of a twelvemonth, is at the rate of\r\nbut two and a half in a hundred; but in an African voyage,\r\nnotwithstanding the old are excluded and few infants admitted, so that\r\nthose who are shipped are in the firmest period of life, the list of\r\ndeaths, presents an annual mortality of forty-three in a hundred. It\r\npresents this mortality even in vessels from the windward coast of\r\nAfrica; but in those which sail to Bonny, Benin, and the Calabars, from\r\nwhence the greatest proportion of the slaves are brought, this mortality\r\nis increased by a variety of causes, (of which the greater length of the\r\nvoyage is one,) and is said to be twice as large which supposes that in\r\nevery hundred the deaths annually amount to no less than eighty-six. Yet\r\neven the former comparatively low mortality; of which the counsel speaks\r\nwith so much satisfaction, as a proof of the kind and compassionate\r\ntreatment of the slaves, even this indolent and lethargic destruction\r\ngives to the march of death seventeen times its usual speed. It is a\r\ndestruction, which, if general but for ten years, would depopulate the\r\nworld, blast the purposes of its creation, and extinguish the human\r\nrace.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having gone with great ability through the other branches of the\r\nsubject, he concluded in the following manner:--\"Thus I have considered\r\nthe various objections which have been stated to the bill, and am\r\nashamed to reflect that it could be necessary to speak so long in\r\ndefence of such a cause; for what, after all, is asked by the proposed\r\nregulations? On the part of the Africans, the whole of their purport is,\r\nthat they whom you allow to be robbed of all things but life, may not\r\nunnecessarily and wantonly be deprived of life also. To the honour; to\r\nthe wisdom, to the feelings of the house, I now make my appeal,\r\nperfectly confident that you will not tolerate, as senators, a traffic\r\nwhich, as men, you shudder to contemplate, and that you will not take\r\nupon yourselves the responsibility of this waste of existence. To the\r\nmemory of former parliaments the horrors of this traffic will be an\r\neternal reproach; yet former parliaments have not known, as you on the\r\nclearest evidence now know, the dreadful nature of this trade. Should\r\nyou reject this bill, no exertions of yours to rescue from oppression\r\nthe suffering inhabitants of your eastern empire; no records of the\r\nprosperous state to which, after a long and unsuccessful war, you have\r\nrestored your native land; no proofs; however splendid, that under your\r\nguidance Great Britain has recovered her rank, and is again the\r\narbitress of nations, will save your names from the stigma of\r\neverlasting dishonour. The broad mantle of this one infamy will cover\r\nwith substantial blackness the radiance of your glory, and change to\r\nfeelings of abhorrence the present admiration of the world. But pardon\r\nthe supposition of so impossible an event. I believe that justice and\r\nmercy may be considered as the attributes of your character, and that\r\nyou will not tarnish their lustre on this occasion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer rose next; and after having made some\r\nimportant observations on the evidence (which took up much time), he\r\ndeclared himself most unequivocally in favour of the motion made by the\r\nhonourable baronet. He was convinced that the regulation proposed would\r\nnot tend to the abolition of the trade; but if it even went so far, he\r\nhad no hesitation openly and boldly to declare, that if it could not be\r\ncarried on in a manner different from that stated by the members for\r\nLiverpool, he would retract what he had said on a former day against\r\ngoing into the general question; and, waving every other discussion than\r\nwhat had that day taken place, he would give his vote for the utter\r\nannihilation of it at once. It was a trade, which it was shocking to\r\nhumanity to hear detailed. If it were to be carried, on as proposed by\r\nthe petitioners, it would, besides its own intrinsic baseness, be\r\ncontrary to every humane and Christian principle, and to every sentiment\r\nthat ought to inspire the breast of man; and would reflect the greatest\r\ndishonour on the British senate and the British nation. He, therefore,\r\nhoped that the house, being now in possession of such information as\r\nnever hitherto had been brought before them, would in some measure\r\nendeavour to extricate themselves from that guilt, and from that\r\nremorse, which every one of them ought to feel for having suffered such\r\nmonstrous cruelties to be practised upon an helpless and unoffending\r\npart of the human race.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin complimented Mr. Pitt in terms of the warmest panegyric on\r\nhis noble sentiments, declaring that they reflected the greatest honour\r\nupon him both as an Englishman and as a man.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the house divided upon the motion of Sir William Dolben.\r\nFifty-six appeared to be in favour of it, and only five against it. The\r\nlatter consisted of the two members for Liverpool and three other\r\ninterested persons. This was the first division which ever took place on\r\nthis important subject. The other blanks were then filled up, and the\r\nbill was passed without further delay.\r\n\r\nThe next day, or on the 18th of June, it was carried up to the House of\r\nLords. The slave-merchants of London, Liverpool, and Bristol,\r\nimmediately presented petitions against it, as they had done in the\r\nlower house. They prayed that counsel might open their case; and though\r\nthey had been driven from the Commons on account of their evidence, with\r\ndisgrace, they had the effrontery to ask that they might call witnesses\r\nhere also.\r\n\r\nCounsel and evidence having been respectively heard, the bill was\r\nordered to be committed the next day. The Lords attended according to\r\nsummons. But on a motion by Dr. Warren, the Bishop of Bangor, who stated\r\nthat the Lord Chancellor Thurlow was much indisposed, and that he wished\r\nto be present when the question was discussed, the committee was\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\nIt was generally thought that the reason for this postponement, and\r\nparticularly as it was recommended by a prelate, was that the Chancellor\r\nmight have an opportunity of forwarding this humane bill. But it was\r\nfound to be quite otherwise. It appeared that the motive was, that he\r\nmight give to it, by his official appearance as the chief servant of the\r\ncrown in that house, all the opposition in his power. For when the day\r\narrived which had been appointed for the discussion, and when the Lords\r\nBathurst and Hawkesbury (afterwards Liverpool) had expressed their\r\nopinions, which were different, relative to the time when the bill\r\nshould take place, he rose up and pronounced a bitter and vehement\r\noration against it. He said, among other things, that it was full of\r\ninconsistency and nonsense from the beginning to the end. The French had\r\nlately offered large premiums for the encouragement of this trade. They\r\nwere a politic people, and the presumption was, that we were doing\r\npolitically wrong by abandoning it. The bill ought not to have been\r\nbrought forward in this session. The introduction of it was a direct\r\nviolation of the faith of the other house. It was unjust, when an\r\nassurance had been given that the question should not be agitated till\r\nnext year, that this sudden fit of philanthropy, which was but a few\r\ndays old, should be allowed to disturb the public mind, and to become\r\nthe occasion of bringing men to the metropolis with tears in their eyes\r\nand horror in their countenances, to deprecate the ruin of their\r\nproperty, which they had embarked on the faith of parliament.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary part which the Lord Chancellor Thurlow took upon this\r\noccasion, was ascribed at the time by many who moved in the higher\r\ncircles, to a shyness or misunderstanding which had taken place between\r\nhim and Mr. Pitt on other matters; when, believing this bill to have\r\nbeen a favourite measure with the latter, he determined to oppose it.\r\nBut whatever were his motives (and let us hope that he could never have\r\nbeen actuated by so malignant a spirit as that of sacrificing the\r\nhappiness of forty thousand persons for the next year to spite the\r\ngratification of an individual), his opposition had a mischievous\r\neffect, on account of the high situation in which he stood; for he not\r\nonly influenced some of the Lords themselves, but, by taking the cause\r\nof the slave-merchants so conspicuously under his wing, he gave them\r\nboldness to look up again under the stigma of their iniquitous calling,\r\nand courage even to resume vigorous operations after their disgraceful\r\ndefeat. Hence arose those obstacles which will be found to have been\r\nthrown in the way of the passing of the bill from this period.\r\n\r\nAmong the Lords who are to be particularly noticed as having taken the\r\nsame side as the Lord Chancellor in this debate, were the Duke of\r\nChandos and the Earl of Sandwich. The former foresaw nothing but\r\ninsurrections of the slaves in our islands, and the massacre of their\r\nmasters there, in consequence of the agitation of this question. The\r\nlatter expected nothing less than the ruin of our marine. He begged the\r\nhouse to consider how, by doing that which might bring about the\r\nabolition of this traffic, they might lessen the number of British\r\nsailors; how, by throwing it into the hands of France they might\r\nincrease those of a rival nation; and how, in consequence, the flag of\r\nthe latter might ride triumphant on the ocean. The Slave Trade was\r\nundoubtedly a nursery for our seamen. All objections against it in this\r\nrespect were ill-founded. It was as healthy as the Newfoundland and many\r\nother trades.\r\n\r\nThe debate having closed, during which nothing more was done than\r\nfilling up the blanks with the time when the bill was to begin to\r\noperate, the committee was adjourned. But the bill after this dragged on\r\nso heavily, that it would be tedious to detail the proceedings upon it\r\nfrom day to day. I shall, therefore, satisfy myself with the following\r\nobservations concerning them:--The committee sat not less than five\r\ndifferent times, which consumed the space of eight days, before a final\r\ndecision took place. During this time, so much was it an object to throw\r\nin obstacles which might occupy the little remaining time of the\r\nsession, that other petitions were presented against the bill, and leave\r\nwas asked, on new pretences contained in these, that counsel might be\r\nheard again. Letters also were read from Jamaica, about the mutinous\r\ndisposition of the slaves there, in consequence of the stir which had\r\nbeen made about the abolition; and also from merchants in France, by\r\nwhich large offers were made to the British merchants to furnish them\r\nwith slaves. Several regulations also were proposed in this interval,\r\nsome of which were negatived by majorities of only one or two voices. Of\r\nthe regulations which were carried, the most remarkable were those\r\nproposed by Lord Hawkesbury (afterwards Liverpool); namely, that no\r\ninsurance should be made on the slaves, except against accidents by fire\r\nand water; that persons should not be appointed as officers of vessels\r\ntransporting them, who had not been a certain number of such voyages\r\nbefore; that a regular surgeon only should be capable of being employed\r\nin them; and that both the captain and surgeon should have bounties, if,\r\nin the course of the transportation, they had lost only two in a hundred\r\nslaves. The Duke of Chandos again, and Lord Sydney, were the more\r\nconspicuous among the opposers of the humane bill; and the Duke of\r\nRichmond, the Marquis Townshend, the Earl of Carlisle, the Bishop of\r\nLondon, and Earl Stanhope, among the most strenuous supporters of it. At\r\nlength it passed by a majority of nineteen to eleven votes.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, when the bill had been returned to the Commons, it\r\nwas moved, that the amendments made in it by the Lords should be read;\r\nbut as it had become a money-bill in consequence of the bounties to be\r\ngranted, and as new regulations were to be incorporated in it, it was\r\nthought proper that it should be wholly done away. Accordingly Sir\r\nWilliam Dolben moved, that the further consideration of it should be put\r\noff till that day three months. This having been agreed upon, he then\r\nmoved for leave to bring in a new bill. This was accordingly introduced,\r\nand an additional clause was inserted in it, relative to bounties, by\r\nMr. Pitt. But on the second reading, that no obstacle might be omitted\r\nwhich could legally be thrown in the way of its progress, petitions were\r\npresented against it, both by the Liverpool merchants and the agent for\r\nthe island of Jamaica, under the pretence that it was a new bill. Their\r\npetitions, however, were rejected, and it was committed and passed\r\nthrough its regular stages, and sent up to the Lords.\r\n\r\nOn its arrival there on the 5th of July, petitions from London and\r\nLiverpool still followed it. The prayer of these was against the general\r\ntendency of it, but it was solicited also that counsel might be heard in\r\na particular case; the solicitation was complied with; after which the\r\nbill was read a second time, and ordered to be committed.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, when it was taken next into consideration, two other\r\npetitions were presented against it. But here so many objections were\r\nmade to the clauses of it as they then stood, and such new matter\r\nsuggested that the Duke of Richmond, who was a strenuous supporter of\r\nit, thought it best to move that the committee then sitting should be\r\ndeferred till that day seven-night, in order to give time for another\r\nmore perfect to originate in the lower house.\r\n\r\nThis motion having been acceded to, Sir William Dolben introduced a new\r\none for the third time into the Commons. This included the suggestions\r\nwhich had been made in the Lords. It included also a regulation, on the\r\nmotion of Mr. Sheridan, that no surgeon should be employed as such in\r\nthe slave-vessels, except he had a testimonial that he had passed a\r\nproper examination at Surgeon's Hall. The amendments were all then\r\nagreed to, and the bill was passed through its several stages.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of July, being now fully amended it came for a third time\r\nbefore the Lords; but it was no sooner brought forward than it met with\r\nthe same opposition as it had experienced before. Two new petitions\r\nappeared against it; one from a certain class of persons in Liverpool,\r\nand another from Miles Peter Andrews, Esq., stating that if it passed\r\ninto a law it would injure the sale of his gunpowder, and that he had\r\nrendered great services to the government during the last war, by his\r\nprovision of that article. But here the Lord Chancellor Thurlow reserved\r\nhimself for an effort, which, by occasioning only a day's delay, would,\r\nin that particular period of the session have totally prevented the\r\npassing of the bill. He suggested certain amendments for consideration\r\nand discussion which, if they had agreed upon, must have been carried\r\nagain to the lower House, and sanctioned there before the bill could\r\nhave been complete. But it appeared afterwards, that there would have\r\nbeen no time for the latter proceeding. Earl Stanhope, therefore,\r\npressed this circumstance peculiarly upon the lords who were present. He\r\nobserved that the king was to dismiss the parliament next day, and\r\ntherefore they must adopt the bill as it stood, or reject it altogether.\r\nThere was no alternative, and no time was to be lost: accordingly, he\r\nmoved for an immediate division on the first of the amendments proposed\r\nby Lord Thurlow. This having taken place, it was negatived. The other\r\namendments shared the same fate; and thus, at length, passed through the\r\nUpper House, as through an ordeal as it were of fire, the first bill\r\nthat ever put fetters upon that barbarous and destructive monster, the\r\nSlave Trade.\r\n\r\nThe next day, or on Friday, July the 11th, the king gave his assent to\r\nit, and, as Lord Stanhope had previously asserted in the House of Lords,\r\nconcluded the session.\r\n\r\nWhile the legislature was occupied in the consideration of this bill,\r\nthe lords of the council continued their examinations, that they might\r\ncollect as much light as possible previously to the general agitation of\r\nthe question in the next session of parliament. Among others I underwent\r\nan examination: I gave my testimony first, relative to many of the\r\nnatural productions of Africa, of which I produced the specimens. These\r\nwere such as I had collected in the course of my journey to Bristol and\r\nLiverpool, and elsewhere. I explained, secondly, the loss and usage of\r\nseamen in the Slave Trade. To substantiate certain points, which\r\nbelonged to this branch of the subject, I left several depositions and\r\narticles of agreement for the examination of the council. With respect\r\nto others, as it would take a long time to give all the data upon which\r\ncalculations had been made, and the manner of making them, I was desired\r\nto draw up a statement of particulars, and to send it to the council at\r\na future time. I left also depositions with them, relative to certain\r\ninstances of the mode of procuring and treating slaves.\r\n\r\nThe committee also for effecting the abolition of the Slave Trade\r\ncontinued their attention, during this period, towards the promotion of\r\nthe different objects which came within the range of the institution.\r\n\r\nThey added the Rev. Dr. Coombe, in consequence of the great increase of\r\ntheir business, to the list of their members.\r\n\r\nThey voted thanks to Mr. Hughes, vicar of Ware, in Hertfordshire, for\r\nhis excellent answer to Harris's _Scriptural Researches on the Licitness\r\nof the Slave Trade_, and they enrolled him among their honorary and\r\ncorresponding members. Also thanks to William Roscoe, Esq., for his\r\nAnswer to the same. Mr. Roscoe had not affixed his name to this pamphlet\r\nany more than to his poem of _The Wrongs of Africa_; but he made himself\r\nknown to the committee as the author of both. Also thanks to William\r\nSmith and Henry Beaufoy, Esqrs., for having so successfully exposed the\r\nevidence offered by the slave merchants against the bill of Sir William\r\nDolben, and for having drawn out of it so many facts, all making for\r\ntheir great object the abolition of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nAs the great question was to be discussed in the approaching sessions,\r\nit was moved in the committee to consider of the propriety of sending\r\npersons to Africa and the West Indies, who should obtain information\r\nrelative to the different branches of the system as they existed in each\r\nof these countries, in order that they might be able to give their\r\ntestimony, from their own experience, before one or both of the houses\r\nof parliament, as it might be judged proper. This proposition was\r\ndiscussed at two or three several meetings. It was, however, finally\r\nrejected, and principally on the following grounds--First, It was\r\nobvious that persons sent out upon such an errand would be exposed to\r\nsuch dangers from varying causes, that it was not improbably that both\r\nthey and their testimony might be lost. Secondly, Such persons would be\r\nobliged to have recourse to falsehoods, that is, to conceal or\r\nmisrepresent the objects of their destination, that they might get their\r\nintelligence with safety; which falsehoods the committee could not\r\ncountenance. To which it was added, that few persons would go to these\r\nplaces, except they were handsomely rewarded for their trouble; but this\r\nreward would lessen the value of their evidence, as it would afford a\r\nhandle to the planters and slave-merchants to say that they had been\r\nbribed.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which came before the committee was the\r\nfollowing:--Many arguments were afloat at this time relative to the\r\ngreat impolicy of abolishing the Slave Trade, the principal of which\r\nwas, that, if the English abandoned it, other foreign nations would take\r\nit up; and thus, while they gave up certain national profits themselves,\r\nthe great cause of humanity would not be benefited, nor would any moral\r\ngood be done by the measure. Now there was a presumption that, by means\r\nof the society instituted in Paris, the French nation might be awakened\r\nto this great subject; and that the French government might in\r\nconsequence, as well as upon other considerations, be induced to favour\r\nthe general feeling upon this occasion. But there was no reason to\r\nconclude, either than any other maritime people, who had been engaged in\r\nthe Slave Trade, would relinquish it, or that any other, who had not yet\r\nbeen engaged in it, would not begin it when our countrymen should give\r\nit up. The consideration of these circumstances occupied the attention\r\nof the committee; and as Dr. Spaarman, who was said to have been\r\nexamined by the privy council, was returning home, it was thought\r\nadvisable to consider whether it would not be proper for the committee\r\nto select certain of their own books on the subject of the Slave Trade,\r\nand send them by him, accompanied by a letter, to the King of Sweden, in\r\nwhich they should entreat his consideration of this powerful argument\r\nwhich now stood in the way of the cause of humanity, with a view that,\r\nas one of the princes of Europe, he might contribute to obviate it, by\r\npreventing his own subjects, in case of the dereliction of this commerce\r\nby ourselves, from embarking in it. The matter having been fully\r\nconsidered, it was resolved that the proposed measure would be proper,\r\nand it was accordingly adapted. By a letter received afterwards from Dr.\r\nSpaarman, it appeared that both the letter and the books had been\r\ndelivered, and received graciously; and that he was authorized to say,\r\nthat, unfortunately, in consequence of those hereditary possessions\r\nwhich had devolved upon His Majesty, he was obliged to confess that he\r\nwas the sovereign of an island which had been principally peopled by\r\nAfrican slaves, but that he had been frequently mindful of their hard\r\ncase. With respect to the Slave Trade, he never heard of an instance in\r\nwhich the merchants of his own native realm had embarked in it; and as\r\nthey had preserved their character pure in this respect, he would do all\r\nhe could that it should not be sullied in the eyes of the generous\r\nEnglish nation, by taking up, in the case which had been pointed out to\r\nhim, such an odious concern.\r\n\r\nBy this time I had finished my _Essay on the Impolicy of the Slave\r\nTrade_, which I composed from materials collected chiefly during my\r\njourney to Bristol, Liverpool, and Lancaster. These materials I had\r\nadmitted with great caution and circumspection; indeed I admitted none\r\nfor which I could not bring official and other authentic documents, or\r\nliving evidences if necessary, whose testimony could not reasonably be\r\ndenied; and when I gave them to the world, I did it under the impression\r\nthat I ought to give them as scrupulously as if I were to be called upon\r\nto substantiate them upon oath. It was of peculiar moment that this book\r\nshould make its appearance at this time. First, Because it would give\r\nthe lords of the council, who were then sitting, an opportunity of\r\nseeing many important facts, and of inquiring into their authenticity;\r\nand it might suggest to them, also, some new points, or such as had not\r\nfallen within the limits of the arrangement they had agreed upon for\r\ntheir examinations on this subject: and secondly, Because, as the\r\nmembers of the House of Commons were to take the question into\r\nconsideration early in the next sessions, it would give them, also, new\r\nlight and information upon it before this period. Accordingly the\r\ncommittee ordered two thousand copies of it to be struck off, for these\r\nand other objects; and though the contents of it were most diligently\r\nsifted by the different opponents of the cause, they never even made an\r\nattempt to answer it. It continued, on the other hand, during the\r\ninquiry of the legislature, to afford the basis or grounds upon which to\r\nexamine evidences on the political part of the subject; and evidences\r\nthus examined continued in their turn to establish it.\r\n\r\nAmong the other books ordered to be printed by the committee within the\r\nperiod now under our consideration, were a new edition of two thousand\r\nof the DEAN OF MIDDLEHAM'S _Letter_, and another of three thousand of\r\nFALCONBBIDGE'S _Account of the Slave Trade_.\r\n\r\nThe committee continued to keep ups, during the same period, a\r\ncommunication with many of their old correspondents, whose names have\r\nbeen already mentioned. But they received, also, letters from others,\r\nwho had not hitherto addressed them: namely, from Ellington Wright, of\r\nErith; Dr. Franklin, of Philadelphia; Eustace Kentish, Esq., high\r\nsheriff for the county of Huntingdon; Governor Bouchier; the Reverend\r\nCharles Symmons, of Haverfordwest; and from John York and William\r\nDownes, Esquires, high sheriffs for the counties of York and Hereford.\r\n\r\nA letter, also, was read in this interval from Mr. Evans, a dissenting\r\nclergyman, of Bristol, stating that the elders of several Baptist\r\nchurches, forming the western Baptist association, who had met at,\r\nPortsmouth Common, had resolved to recommend it to the ministers and\r\nmembers of the same, to unite with the committee in the promotion of the\r\ngreat object of their institution.\r\n\r\nAnother from Mr. Andrew Irvin, of the Island of Grenada, in which he\r\nconfirmed the wretched situation of many of the slaves there, and in\r\nwhich he gave the outlines of a plan for bettering their condition, as\r\nwell as that of those in the other islands.\r\n\r\nAnother from I.L. Wynne, Esq., of Jamaica. In this he gave an afflicting\r\naccount of the suffering and unprotected state of the slaves there,\r\nwhich it was high time to rectify. He congratulated the committee on\r\ntheir institution, which he thought would tend to promote so desirable\r\nan end; but desired them not to stop short of the total abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade, as no other measure would prove effectual against the evils\r\nof which he complained. This trade, he said, was utterly unnecessary, as\r\nhis own plantation, on which his slaves had increased rapidly by\r\npopulation, and others which he knew to be similarly circumstanced,\r\nwould abundantly testify. He concluded by promising to give the\r\ncommittee such information from time to time as might be useful on this\r\nimportant subject.\r\n\r\nThe session of parliament having closed, the committee thought it right\r\nto make a report to the public: in which they gave an account of the\r\ngreat progress of their cause since the last; of the state in which they\r\nthen were; and of the unjustifiable conduct of their opponents, who\r\nindustriously misrepresented their views, but particularly by\r\nattributing to them the design of abolishing slavery: and they concluded\r\nby exhorting their friends not to relax their endeavours on account of\r\nfavourable appearances; but to persevere, as if nothing had been done,\r\nunder the pleasing hope of an honourable triumph.\r\n\r\nAnd now having given the substance of the labours of the committee from\r\nits formation to the present time, I cannot conclude this chapter\r\nwithout giving to the worthy members of it that tribute of affectionate\r\nand grateful praise, which is due to them for their exertions in having\r\nforwarded the great cause which was intrusted to their care. And this I\r\ncan do with more propriety, because, having been so frequently absent\r\nfrom them when they were engaged in the pursuit of this their duty, I\r\ncannot be liable to the suspicion, that in bestowing commendation upon\r\nthem I am bestowing it upon myself. From about the end of May, 1787, to\r\nthe middle of July, 1788, they had no less than fifty-one committees.\r\nThese generally occupied them from about six in the evening till about\r\neleven at night. In the intervals between the committees they were often\r\noccupied, having each of them some object committed to his charge. It is\r\nremarkable, too, that though they were all, except one, engaged in,\r\nbusiness or trade, and though they had the same calls as other men for\r\ninnocent recreation, and the same interruptions of their health, there\r\nwere individuals who were not absent more than five or six times within\r\nthis period. In the course of the thirteen months, during which they had\r\nexercised this public trust, they had printed, and afterwards\r\ndistributed, not at random, but judiciously, and through, respectable\r\nchannels, (besides 26,526 reports, accounts of debates in parliament,\r\nand other small papers,) no less than 51,432 pamphlets, or books.\r\n\r\nNor, was the effect, produced within this short period otherwise than\r\ncommensurate with the efforts used. In May, 1787, the only public notice\r\ntaken of this great cause was by this committee of twelve individuals,\r\nof whom all were little known to the world except Mr. Granville Sharp.\r\nBut in July, 1788, it had attracted the notice of several distinguished\r\nindividuals in France and Germany; and in our own country it had come\r\nwithin the notice of the government, and a branch of it had undergone a\r\nparliamentary discussion and restraint. It had arrested, also, the\r\nattention of the nation, and it had produced a kind of holy flame, or\r\nenthusiasm, and this to a degree and to an extent never before\r\nwitnessed. Of the purity of this flame no better proof can be offered,\r\nthan that even Bishops deigned to address an obscure committee,\r\nconsisting principally of Quakers; and that Churchmen and Dissenters\r\nforgot their difference of religious opinions, and joined their hands,\r\nall over the kingdom, in its support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nContinuation from June 1788 to July 1789.--Author travels to collect\r\nfurther evidence; great difficulties in obtaining it; forms committees\r\non his tour.--Privy council resume the examinations; inspect cabinet\r\nof African productions; obliged to leave many of the witnesses in\r\nbehalf of the abolition unexamined; prepare their report--Labours of\r\nthe committee in the interim.--Proceedings of the planters and\r\nothers.--Report laid on the table of the House of\r\nCommons.--Introduction of the question, and debate there; twelve\r\npropositions deduced from the report and reserved for future\r\ndiscussion; day of discussion arrives; opponents refuse to argue from\r\nthe report; require new evidence; this granted and introduced; further\r\nconsideration of the subject deferred to the next session.--Renewal of\r\nSir William Dolben's bill.--Death and character of Ramsay.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatters had now become serious. The gauntlet had been thrown down and\r\naccepted. The combatants had taken their stations, and the contest was\r\nto be renewed, which was to be decided soon on the great theatre of the\r\nnation. The committee by the very act of their institution had\r\npronounced the Slave Trade to be criminal. They, on the other hand, who\r\nwere concerned in it, had denied the charge. It became the one to prove,\r\nand the other to refute it, or to fall in the ensuing session.\r\n\r\nThe committee, in this perilous situation, were anxious to find out such\r\nother persons as might become proper evidences before the privy council.\r\nThey had hitherto sent there only nine or ten, and they had then only\r\nanother, whom they could count upon for this purpose, in their view. The\r\nproposal of sending persons to Africa, and the West Indies, who might\r\ncome back and report what they had witnessed, had already been\r\nnegatived. The question then was, what they were to do. Upon this they\r\ndeliberated, and the result was an application to me to undertake a\r\njourney to different parts of the kingdom for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen this determination was made, I was at Teston, writing a long letter\r\nto the privy council on the ill usage and mortality of the seamen\r\nemployed in the Slave Trade, which it had been previously agreed should\r\nbe received as evidence there. I thought it proper, however, before I\r\ntook my departure, to form a system of questions upon the general\r\nsubject. These I divided into six tables. The first related to the\r\nproductions of Africa, and the dispositions and manners of the natives.\r\nThe second, to the methods of reducing them to slavery. The third, to\r\nthe manner of bringing them to the ships, their value, the medium of\r\nexchange, and other circumstances. The fourth, to their transportation.\r\nThe fifth, to their treatment in the colonies. The sixth, to the seamen\r\nemployed in the trade. These tables contained together one hundred and\r\nforty-five questions. My idea was that they should be printed on a small\r\nsheet of paper, which should be folded up in seven or eight leaves, of\r\nthe length and breadth of a small almanac, and then be sent in franks to\r\nour different correspondents. These, when they had them, might examine\r\npersons capable of giving evidence, who might live in their\r\nneighbourhoods, or fall in their way, and return us their examinations\r\nby letter.\r\n\r\nThe committee having approved and printed the tables of questions, I\r\nbegan my tour. I had selected the southern counties from Kent to\r\nCornwall for it. I had done this, because these included the great\r\nstations of the ships of war in ordinary; and as these were all under\r\nthe superintendence of Sir Charles Middleton, as comptroller of the\r\nnavy, I could get an introduction to those on board them. Secondly,\r\nbecause sea-faring people, when they retire from a marine life, usually\r\nsettle in some town or village upon the coast.\r\n\r\nOf this tour I shall not give the reader any very particular account. I\r\nshall mention only those things which are most worthy of his notice in\r\nit. At Poole, in Dorsetshire, I laid the foundation of a committee, to\r\nact in harmony with that of London for the promotion of the cause. Moses\r\nNeave, of the respectable society of the Quakers, was the chairman;\r\nThomas Bell, the secretary; and Ellis B. Metford and the Reverend Mr.\r\nDavis and others the committee. This was the third committee which had\r\nbeen instituted in the country for this purpose. That at Bristol, under\r\nMr. Joseph Harford as chairman, and Mr. Lunell as secretary, had been\r\nthe first: and that at Manchester, under Mr. Thomas Walker as chairman,\r\nand Mr. Samuel Jackson as secretary, had been the second.\r\n\r\nAs Poole was a great place for carrying on the trade to Newfoundland, I\r\ndetermined to examine the assertion of the Earl of Sandwich in the House\r\nof Lords, when he said, in the debate on Sir William Dolben's bill, that\r\nthe Slave Trade was not more fatal to seamen than the Newfoundland and\r\nsome others. This assertion I knew at the time to be erroneous, as far\r\nas my own researches had been concerned: for out of twenty-four vessels,\r\nwhich had sailed out of the port of Bristol in that employ, only two\r\nsailors were upon the dead list. In sixty vessels from Poole, I found\r\nbut four lost. At Dartmouth, where I went afterwards on purpose, I found\r\nalmost a similar result. On conversing, however, with Governor\r\nHoldsworth, I learnt that the year 1786 had been more fatal than any\r\nother in this trade. I learnt that in consequence of extraordinary\r\nstorms and hurricanes, no less than five sailors had died and twenty-one\r\nhad been drowned in eighty-three vessels from that port. Upon this\r\nstatement I determined to look into the muster-rolls of the trade there\r\nfor two or three years together. I began by accident with the year 1769,\r\nand I went on to the end of 1772. About eighty vessels on an average had\r\nsailed thence in each of these years. Taking the loss in these years,\r\nand compounding it with that in the fatal year, three sailors had been\r\nlost; but taking it in these four years by themselves, only two had been\r\nlost in twenty-four vessels so employed. On comparison with the Slave\r\nTrade, the result would be, that two vessels to Africa would destroy\r\nmore seamen than eighty-three sailing to Newfoundland. There was this\r\ndifference also to be noted, that the loss in the one trade was\r\ngenerally by the weather or by accident, but in the other by cruel\r\ntreatment or disease; and that they who went out in a declining state of\r\nhealth in the one, came home generally recovered; whereas they, who went\r\nout robust in the other, came home in a shattered condition.\r\n\r\nAt Plymouth I laid the foundation of another committee. The late William\r\nCookworthy, the late John Prideaux, and James Fox, all of the society of\r\nthe Quakers, and Mr. George Leach, Samuel Northcote and John Saunders,\r\nhad a principal share in forming it. Sir William Ellford was chosen\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\nFrom Plymouth I journeyed on to Falmouth, and from thence to Exeter,\r\nwhere having meetings with the late Mr. Samuel Milford, the late Mr.\r\nGeorge Manning, the Reverend James Manning, Thomas Sparkes, and others,\r\na desire became manifest among them of establishing a committee there.\r\nThis was afterwards effected; and Mr. Milford, who at a general meeting\r\nof the inhabitants of Exeter, on the 10th of June, on this great\r\nsubject, had been called by those present to the chair, was appointed\r\nthe chairman of it.\r\n\r\nWith respect to evidence, which was the great object of this tour, I\r\nfound myself often very unpleasantly situated in collecting it. I heard\r\nof many persons capable of giving it to our advantage, to whom I could\r\nget no introduction. I had to go after these many miles out of my\r\nestablished route. Not knowing me, they received me coldly, and even\r\nsuspiciously; while I fell in with others, who, considering themselves,\r\non account of their concerns and connexions, as our opponents, treated\r\nme in an uncivil manner.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulties and disappointments in other respects which I\r\nexperienced in this tour,--even where I had an introduction, and where\r\nthe parties were not interested in the continuance of the Slave\r\nTrade,--were greater than people in general would have imagined. One\r\nwould have thought, considering the great enthusiasm of the nation on\r\nthis important subject, that they who could have given satisfactory\r\ninformation upon it, would have rejoiced to do it. But I found it\r\notherwise; and this frequently to my sorrow. There was an aversion in\r\npersons to appear before such a tribunal as they conceived the privy\r\ncouncil to be. With men of shy or timid character this operated as an\r\ninsuperable barrier in their way. But it operated more or less upon all.\r\nIt was surprising to see what little circumstances affected many. When I\r\ntook out my pen and ink to put down the information which a person was\r\ngiving me, he became evidently embarrassed and frightened. He began to\r\nexcuse himself from staying, by alleging that he had nothing more to\r\ncommunicate, and he took himself away as quickly as he could with\r\ndecency. The sight of the pen and ink had lost me so many good\r\nevidences, that I was obliged wholly to abandon the use of them, and to\r\nbetake myself to other means. I was obliged for the future to commit my\r\ntables of questions to memory; and endeavour by practice to put down,\r\nafter the examination of a person, such answers as he had given me to\r\neach of them.\r\n\r\nOthers went off, because it happened that immediately on my interview, I\r\nacquainted them with the nature of my errand and solicited their\r\nattendance in London. Conceiving that I had no right to ask them such a\r\nfavour, or terrified at the abruptness and apparent awfulness of my\r\nrequest some of them gave me an immediate denial, which they would never\r\nafterwards retract. I began to perceive in time that it was only by the\r\nmost delicate management that I could get forward on these occasions. I\r\nresolved, therefore, for the future, except in particular cases, that\r\nwhen I should be introduced to persons who had a competent knowledge of\r\nthis trade, I would talk with them upon it as upon any ordinary subject,\r\nand then leave them without saying anything about their becoming\r\nevidences. I would take care, however, to commit all their conversation\r\nto writing when it was over; and I would then try to find out that\r\nperson among their relations or friends, who could apply to them for\r\nthis purpose, with the least hazard of a refusal.\r\n\r\nThere were others, also, who, though they were not so much impressed by\r\nthe considerations mentioned, yet objected to give their public\r\ntestimony. Those whose livelihood, or promotion, or expectations, were\r\ndependent upon the government of the country, were generally backward on\r\nthese occasions. Though they thought they discovered in the\r\nparliamentary conduct of Mr. Pitt, a bias in favour of the cause, they\r\nknew to a certainty that the Lord Chancellor Thurlow was against it.\r\nThey conceived, therefore, that the administration was at least divided\r\nupon the question, and they were fearful of being called upon, lest they\r\nshould give offence, and thus injure their prospects in life. This\r\nobjection was very prevalent in that part of the kingdom which I had\r\nselected for my tour.\r\n\r\nThe reader can hardly conceive how my mind was agitated and distressed\r\non these different accounts. To have travelled more than two months,--to\r\nhave seen many who could have materially served our cause,--and to have\r\nlost most of them,--was very trying. And though it is true that I\r\napplied a remedy, I was not driven to the adoption of it, till I had\r\nperformed more than half my tour. Suffice it to say, that after having\r\ntravelled upwards of sixteen hundred miles backwards and forwards, and\r\nhaving conversed with forty-seven persons, who were capable of promoting\r\nthe cause by their evidence, I could only prevail upon nine, by all the\r\ninterest I could make, to be examined.\r\n\r\nOn my return to London, whither I had been called up by the committee,\r\nto take upon me the superintendence of the evidence, which the privy\r\ncouncil was now ready again to hear, I found my brother: he was then a\r\nyoung officer in the navy; and as I knew he felt as warmly as I did in\r\nthis great cause, I prevailed upon him to go to Havre de Grace, the\r\ngreat slave-port in France, where he might make his observations for two\r\nor three months, and then report what he had seen and heard; so that we\r\nmight have some one to counteract any false statement of things, which\r\nmight be made relative to the subject in that quarter.\r\n\r\nAt length the examinations were resumed, and with them the contest, in\r\nwhich our own reputation and the fate of our cause were involved. The\r\ncommittee for the abolition had discovered, one or two willing evidences\r\nduring my absence; and Mr. Wilberforce, who was now recovered from his\r\nsevere indisposition, had found one or two others. These, added to my\r\nown, made a respectable body; but we had sent no more than four or five\r\nof these to the council, when the king's illness unfortunately stopped\r\nour career. For nearly five weeks between the middle of November and\r\nJanuary, the examinations were interrupted or put off, so that at the\r\nlatter period we began to fear, that there would be scarcely time to\r\nhear the rest; for not only the privy council report was to be printed,\r\nbut the contest itself was to be decided by  the evidence contained in\r\nit, in the existing session.\r\n\r\nThe examinations, however, went on; but they went on only slowly, being\r\nstill subject to interruption from the same unfortunate cause. Among\r\nothers I offered my mite of information again. I wished the council to\r\nsee more of my African productions and manufactures, that they might\r\nreally know what Africa was capable of affording, instead of the Slave\r\nTrade; and that they might make a proper estimate of the genius and\r\ntalents of the natives. The samples which I had collected, had been\r\nobtained by great labour, and at no inconsiderable expense: for whenever\r\nI had notice that a vessel had arrived immediately from that continent,\r\nI never hesitated to go, unless under the most pressing engagements\r\nelsewhere, even as far as Bristol, if I could pick up but a single new\r\narticle. The lords having consented, I selected several things for their\r\ninspection out of my box,--of the contents of which the following\r\naccount may not be unacceptable to the reader:--\r\n\r\nThe first division of the box consisted of woods of about four inches\r\nsquare, all polished. Among these were mahogany of five different sorts,\r\ntulip-wood, satin-wood, cam-wood, bar-wood, fustic, black and yellow\r\nebony, palm-tree, mangrove, calabash, and date. There were seven woods,\r\nof which the native names were remembered; three of these, Tumiah,\r\nSamain, and Jimlake, were of a yellow colour; Acajoú was of a beautiful\r\ndeep crimson; Bork and Quellé were apparently fit for cabinet work; and\r\nBenten was the wood of which the natives made their canoes. Of the,\r\nvarious other woods the names had been forgotten, nor were they known in\r\nEngland at all. One of them was of a fine purple; and from two others,\r\nupon which the privy council had caused experiments to be made, a strong\r\nyellow, a deep orange, and a flesh-colour were extracted.\r\n\r\nThe second, division included ivory and musk; four species of pepper,\r\nthe long, the black, the Cayenne, and the Malaguetta; three species of\r\ngum, namely, Senegal, Copal, and ruber astringens; cinnamon, rice,\r\ntobacco, indigo, white and Nankin cotton, Guinea corn, and millet; three\r\nspecies of beans, of which two were used for food, and the other for\r\ndyeing orange; two species of tamarinds, one for food, and the other to\r\ngive whiteness to the teeth; pulse, seeds, and fruits of various kinds,\r\nsome of the latter of which Dr. Spaarman had pronounced; from a trial\r\nduring his residence in Africa, to be peculiarly valuable as drugs.\r\n\r\nThe third division contained an African loom, and an African spindle\r\nwith spun cotton round it; cloths of cotton of various kinds made by the\r\nnatives, some white, but others dyed by them of different colours, and\r\nothers in which they had interwoven European silk; cloths and bags made\r\nof grass, and fancifully coloured; ornaments made of the same materials;\r\nropes made from a species of aloes and others, remarkably strong, from\r\nglass and straw; fine string made from the fibres of the roots of trees;\r\nsoap of two kinds; one of which was formed from an earthy substance;\r\npipe-bowls made of clay, and of a brown red; one of these, which came\r\nfrom the village of Dakard, was beautifully ornamented by black devices\r\nburnt in, and was besides highly glazed; another brought from Galam, was\r\nmade of earth, which was richly impregnated with little particles of\r\ngold; trinkets made by the natives from their own gold; knives and\r\ndaggers made by them from our bar-iron; and various other articles, such\r\nas bags, sandals, dagger-cases, quivers, grisgris, all made of leather\r\nof their own manufacture, and dyed of various colours, and ingeniously\r\nsewed together.\r\n\r\nThe fourth division consisted of the thumb-screw, speculum oris, and\r\nchains and shackles of different kinds, collected at Liverpool. To these\r\nwere added, iron neck-collars, and other instruments of punishment and\r\nconfinement used in the West Indies, and collected at other places. The\r\ninstrument also, by which Charles Horseler was mentioned to have been\r\nkilled, in a former chapter, was to be seen among these.\r\n\r\nWe were now advanced far into February, when we were alarmed by the\r\nintelligence that the lords of the council were going to prepare their\r\nreport: At this time we had sent but few persons to them to examine, in\r\ncomparison with our opponents, and we had yet eighteen to introduce: for\r\nanswers had come into my tables of questions from several places, and\r\npersons had been pointed out to us by our correspondents, who had\r\nincreased our list of evidences to this number. I wrote therefore to\r\nthem, at the desire of the committee for the abolition, and gave them\r\nthe names of the eighteen, and requested also, that they would order,\r\nfor their own inspection; certain muster-rolls of vessels from Poole and\r\nDartmouth, that they might be convinced that the objection which the\r\nEarl of Sandwich had made in the House of Lords, against the abolition\r\nof the Slave Trade, had no solid foundation. In reply to my first\r\nrequest they informed me, that it was impossible, in the advanced state\r\nof the session, (it being then the middle of March,) that the\r\nexaminations of so many could be taken; but I was at liberty, in\r\nconjunction with the Bishop of London, to select eight for this purpose.\r\nThis occasioned me to address them again; and I then found, to my\r\nsurprise and sorrow, that even this last number was to be diminished;\r\nfor I was informed in writing, \"that the Bishop of London having laid my\r\nlast letter before their lordships, they had agreed to meet on the\r\nSaturday next, and on the Tuesday following, for the purposes of\r\nreceiving the evidence of some of the gentlemen named in it. And it was\r\ntheir lordships' desire that I would give notice to any three of them\r\n(whose information I might consider the most material) of the above\r\ndetermination, that they might attend the committee accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nThis answer, considering the difficulties we had found in collecting a\r\nbody of evidence, and the critical situation in which we were, was\r\npeculiarly distressing; but we had no remedy left us, nor could we\r\nreasonably complain. Three therefore were selected, and they were sent\r\nto deliver their testimony on their arrival in town.\r\n\r\nBut before the last of these had left the council room, who should come\r\nup to me but Dr. Arnold? He had but lately arrived at Bristol from\r\nAfrica; and having heard from our friends there that we had been daily\r\nlooking for him, he had come to us in London. He and Mr. Gardiner were\r\nthe two surgeons, as mentioned in the former chapter, who had promised\r\nme, when I was in Bristol, in the year 1787, that they would keep a\r\njournal of facts during the voyages they were then going to perform.\r\nThey had both kept this promise. Gardiner, I found, had died upon the\r\ncoast; and his journal, having been discovered at his death, had been\r\nburied with him in great triumph. But Arnold had survived, and he came\r\nnow to offer us his services in the cause.\r\n\r\nAs it was a pity that such correct information as that taken down in\r\nwriting upon the spot should be lost (for all the other evidences,\r\nexcept Dr. Spaarman and Mr. Wadstrom, had spoken from their memory\r\nonly), I made all the interest I could to procure a hearing for Mr.\r\nArnold. Pleading now for the examination of him only, and under these\r\nparticular circumstances, I was attended to. It was consented, in\r\nconsequence of the little time which was now left for preparing and\r\nprinting the report, that I should make out his evidence from his\r\njournal under certain heads. This I did. Mr. Arnold swore to the truth\r\nof it, when so drawn up, before Edward Montague, Esquire, a master in\r\nChancery. He then delivered the paper in which it was contained to the\r\nlords of the council, who, on receiving it, read it throughout, and then\r\nquestioned him upon it.\r\n\r\nAt this time, also, my brother returned with accounts and papers\r\nrelative to the Slave Trade from Havre de Grace; but as I had pledged\r\nmyself to offer no other person to be examined, his evidence was lost.\r\nThus, after all the pains we had taken, and in a contest, too, on the\r\nsuccess of which our own reputation and the fate of Africa depended, we\r\nwere obliged to fight the battle with sixteen less than we could have\r\nbrought into the field; while our opponents, on the other hand, on\r\naccount of their superior advantages, had mustered all their forces, not\r\nhaving omitted a single man.\r\n\r\nI do not know of any period of my life in which I suffered so much, both\r\nin body and mind, as from the time of resuming these public inquiries by\r\nthe privy council, to the time when they were closed. For I had my\r\nweekly duty to attend at the committee for the abolition during this\r\ninterval. I had to take down the examinations of all the evidences who\r\ncame to London, and to make certain copies of these. I had to summon\r\nthese to town, and to make provision against all accidents; and here I\r\nwas often troubled, by means of circumstances, which unexpectedly\r\noccurred, lest, when committees of the council had been purposely\r\nappointed to hear them, they should not be forthcoming at the time. I\r\nhad also a new and extensive correspondence to keep up; for the tables\r\nof questions which had been sent down to our correspondents, brought\r\nletters almost innumerable on this subject, and they were always\r\naddressed to me. These not only required answers of themselves, but as\r\nthey usually related to persons capable of giving their testimony, and\r\ncontained the particulars of what they could state, they occasioned\r\nfresh letters to be written to others. Hence the writing often of ten or\r\ntwelve daily became necessary.\r\n\r\nBut the contents of these letters afforded the circumstances, which gave\r\nbirth to so much suffering. They contained usually some affecting tale\r\nof woe. At Bristol my feelings had been harassed by the cruel treatment\r\nof the seamen, which had come to my knowledge there: but now I was\r\ndoomed to see this treatment over again in many other melancholy\r\ninstances; and, additionally, to take in the various sufferings of the\r\nunhappy slaves. These accounts I could seldom get time to read till late\r\nin the evening, and sometimes not till midnight, when the letters\r\ncontaining them were to be answered. The effect of these accounts was in\r\nsome instances to overwhelm me for a time in tears, and in others to\r\nproduce a vivid indignation, which affected my whole frame. Recovering\r\nfrom these, I walked up and down the room: I felt fresh vigour, and made\r\nnew determinations of perpetual warfare against this impious trade. I\r\nimplored strength that I might succeed. I then sat down, and continued\r\nmy work as long as my wearied eyes would permit me to see. Having been\r\nagitated in this manner, I went to bed; but my rest was frequently\r\nbroken by the visions which floated before me. When I awoke, these\r\nrenewed themselves to me, and they flitted about with me for the\r\nremainder of the day. Thus I was kept continually harassed: my mind was\r\nconfined to one gloomy and heart-breaking subject for months. It had no\r\nrespite, and my health began now materially to suffer.\r\n\r\nBut the contents of these letters were particularly grievous, on account\r\nof the severe labours which they necessarily entailed upon me in other\r\nways than those which have been mentioned. It was my duty, while the\r\nprivy council examinations went on, not only to attend to all the\r\nevidence which was presented to us by our correspondents, but to find\r\nout and select the best. The happiness of millions depended upon it.\r\nHence I was often obliged to travel during these examinations, in order\r\nto converse with those who had been pointed out to us as capable of\r\ngiving their testimony; and, that no time might be lost, to do this in\r\nthe night. More than two hundred miles in a week were sometimes passed\r\nover on these occasions.\r\n\r\nThe disappointments too, which I frequently experienced in journeys,\r\nincreased the poignancy of the, suffering, which arose from a\r\ncontemplation of the melancholy cases which I had thus travelled to\r\nbring forward to the public view. The reader at present can have no idea\r\nof these. I have been sixty miles to visit a person, of whom I had\r\nheard, not only as possessing important knowledge, but as espousing our\r\nopinions on this subject. I have at length seen him. He has applauded my\r\npursuit at our first interview. He has told me, in the course of our\r\nconversation, that neither my own pen, nor that of any other man, could\r\ndescribe adequately the horrors, of the Slave Trade, horrors which he\r\nhimself had witnessed. He has exhorted me to perseverance in this noble\r\ncause. Could I have wished for a more favourable reception!--But mark\r\nthe issue. He was the nearest relation of a rich person concerned in the\r\ntraffic; and if he were to come forward with his evidence publicly, he\r\nshould ruin all his expectations from that Quarter. In the same week I\r\nhave visited another at a still greater distance. I have met with\r\nsimilar applause. I have heard him describe scenes of misery which he\r\nhad witnessed, and on the relation of which he himself almost wept. But\r\nmark the issue again.--\"I am a surgeon,\" says he; \"through that window\r\nyou see a spacious house; it is occupied by a West Indian. The medical\r\nattendance upon his family is of considerable importance to the temporal\r\ninterests of mine. If I give you my evidence I lose his patronage. At\r\nthe house above him lives a East Indian. The two families are connected:\r\nI fear, if I lose the support of one, I shall lose that of the other\r\nalso: but I will give you privately all the intelligence in my power.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader may now conceive the many miserable hours I must have spent,\r\nafter such visits, in returning home; and how grievously my heart must\r\nhave been afflicted by these cruel disappointments, but more\r\nparticularly where they arose from causes inferior to those which have\r\nbeen now mentioned, or from little frivolous excuses, or idle and\r\nunfounded conjectures, unworthy of beings expected to fill a moral\r\nstation in life. Yes, O man! often in these solitary journeyings have I\r\nexclaimed against the baseness of thy nature, when reflecting on the\r\nlittle paltry considerations which have smothered thy benevolence, and\r\nhindered thee from succouring an oppressed brother. And yet, on a\r\nfurther view of things, I have reasoned myself into a kinder feeling\r\ntowards thee. For I have been obliged to consider ultimately, that there\r\nwere both lights and shades in the human character; and that, if the bad\r\npart of our nature was visible on these occasions, the nobler part of it\r\nought not to be forgotten. While I passed a censure upon those, who were\r\nbackward in serving this great cause of humanity and justice, how many\r\ndid I know, who were toiling in the support of it! I drew also this\r\nconsolation from my reflections, that I had done my duty; that I had\r\nleft nothing untried or undone; that amidst all these disappointments I\r\nhad collected information, which might be useful at a future time; and\r\nthat such disappointments were almost inseparable from the prosecution\r\nof a cause of such magnitude, and where the interests of so many were\r\nconcerned:--\r\n\r\nHaving now given a general account of my own proceedings, I shall state\r\nthose of the committee; or show how they contributed, by fulfilling the\r\nduties of their several departments, to promote the cause in the\r\ninterim.\r\n\r\nIn the first place they completed the rules, or code of laws, for their\r\nown government.\r\n\r\nThey continued to adopt and circulate books, that they might still\r\nenlighten the public mind on the subject, and preserve it interested in\r\nfavour of their institution. They kept the press indeed almost\r\nconstantly going for this purpose. They printed, within the period\r\nmentioned, RAMSAY'S, _Address on the proposed Bill for the Abolition;\r\nThe Speech of Henry Beaufoy, Esq., on Sir William Dolben's Bill_, of\r\nwhich an extract is given in Chap. xxiii.; _Notes by a Planter on the\r\ntwo Reports from the Committee of the Honourable House of Assembly of\r\nJamaica_; _Observations on the Slave Trade_ by Mr. Wadstrom; and\r\nDICKSON'S _Letters on Slavery._ These were all new publications. To\r\nthose they added others of less note, with new editions of the old.\r\n\r\nThey voted their thanks to the Rev. Mr. Clifford, for his excellent\r\nSermon on the Slave Trade; to the pastor and congregation of the Baptist\r\nchurch at Maze Pond, Southwark, for their liberal subscription; and to\r\nJohn Barton, one of their own members, for the services he had rendered\r\nthem. The latter, having left his residence in town for one in the\r\ncountry, solicited permission to resign, and hence this mark of\r\napprobation was given to him. He was continued also as an honorary and\r\ncorresponding member.\r\n\r\nThey elected David Hartley and Richard Sharpe, Esqs., into their own\r\nbody, and Alexander Jaffray, Esq., the Rev. Charles Symmons, of\r\nHaverfordwest, and the Rev. T. Burgess (afterwards bishop of Salisbury),\r\nas honorary and corresponding members. The latter had written\r\n_Considerations on the Abolition of Slavery and the Slave Trade, upon\r\ngrounds of natural, religious, and political Duty_, which had been of\r\ngreat service to the cause.\r\n\r\nOf the new correspondents of the committee within this period I may\r\nfirst mention Henry Taylor, of North Shields; William Proud, of Hull;\r\nthe Rev. T. Gisborne, of Yoxall Lodge; and William Ellford, Esq., of\r\nPlymouth. The latter as chairman of the Plymouth committee, sent up for\r\ninspection an engraving of a plan and section of a slave-ship, in which\r\nthe bodies of the slaves were seen stowed in the proportion of rather\r\nless than one to a ton. This happy invention gave all those who saw it a\r\nmuch better idea, than they could otherwise have had, of the horrors of\r\ntheir transportation, and contributed greatly, as will appear,\r\nafterwards, to impress the public in favour of our cause.\r\n\r\nThe next, whom I shall mention, was C.L. Evans, Esq., of West Bromwich;\r\nthe Rev. T. Clarke, of Hull; S.P. Wolferstan, of Stratford, near\r\nTamworth; Edmund Lodge, Esq., of Halifax; the Rev. Caleb Rotheram, of\r\nKendal; and Mr. Campbell Haliburton, of Edinburgh. The news which Mr.\r\nHaliburton sent was very agreeable. He informed us that, in consequence\r\nof the great exertions of Mr. Alison, an institution had been formed in\r\nEdinburgh, similar to that in London, which would take all Scotland\r\nunder its care and management, as far as related to this great subject.\r\nHe mentioned Lord Gardenston as the chairman; Sir William Forbes as the\r\ndeputy-chairman; himself as the secretary; and Lord Napier, Professor\r\nAndrew Hunter, Professor Greenfield, and William Creech, Adam Rolland,\r\nAlexander Ferguson, John Dickson, John Erskine, John Campbell, Archibald\r\nGibson, Archibald Fletcher, and Horatius Canning, Esqrs., as the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThe others were, the Rev. J. Bidlake, of Plymouth; Joseph Storrs, of\r\nChesterfield; William Fothergill, of Carr End, Yorkshire; J. Seymour, of\r\nCoventry; Moses Neave, of Poole; Joseph Taylor, of Scarborough; Timothy\r\nClark, of Doncaster; Thomas Davis, of Milverton; George Croker Fox, of\r\nFalmouth; Benjamin Grubb, of Clonmell in Ireland; Sir William Forbes, of\r\nEdinburgh; the Rev. J. Jamieson, of Forfar; and Joseph Gurney, of\r\nNorwich; the latter of whom sent up a remittance, and intelligence at\r\nthe same time, that a committee, under Mr. Leigh, so often before\r\nmentioned, had been formed in that city[A].\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: On the removal of Mr. Leigh from Norwich, Dr. Pretyman,\r\nprecentor of Lincoln and a prebend of Norwich, succeeded him.]\r\n\r\nBut the committee in London, while they were endeavouring to promote the\r\nobject of their institution at home, continued their exertions for the\r\nsame purpose abroad within this period.\r\n\r\nThey kept up a communication with the different societies established in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThey directed their attention also to the continent of Europe. They had\r\nalready applied, as I mentioned before, to the king of Sweden in favour\r\nof their cause, and had received a gracious answer. They now attempted\r\nto interest other Potentates in it. For this purpose they bound up in an\r\nelegant manner two sets of the _Essays on the Slavery and Commerce of\r\nthe Human Species, and on the Impolicy of the Slave Trade_, and sent\r\nthem to the Chevalier de Pinto, in Portugal. They bound up in a similar\r\nmanner three sets of the same, and sent them to Mr. Eden (afterwards\r\nLord Aukland), at Madrid, to be given to the king of Spain, the Count\r\nd'Aranda, and the Marquis del Campomanes.\r\n\r\nThey kept up their correspondence with the committee at Paris, which had\r\ngreatly advanced itself in the eyes of the French nation; so that, when\r\nthe different bailliages sent deputies to the states-general, they\r\ninstructed them to take the Slave Trade into their consideration as a\r\nnational object, and with a view to its abolition.\r\n\r\nThey kept up their correspondence with Dr. Frossard of Lyons. He had\r\nalready published in France on the subject of the Slave Trade; and now\r\nhe offered the committee to undertake the task, so long projected by\r\nthem, of collecting such arguments and facts concerning it, and\r\ntranslating them into different languages, as might be useful in\r\nforwarding their views in foreign parts.\r\n\r\nThey addressed letters also to various individuals, to Monsieur\r\nSnetlage, doctor of laws at Halle in Saxony; to Monsieur Ladebat, of\r\nBordeaux; to the Marquis de Feuillade d'Aubusson, at Paris; and to\r\nMonsieur Necker. The latter in his answer replied in part as follows:\r\n\"As this great question,\" says he, \"is not in my department, but in that\r\nof the minister for the colonies, I cannot interfere in it directly, but\r\nI will give indirectly all the assistance in my power. I have for a long\r\ntime taken an interest in the general alarm on this occasion, and in the\r\nnoble alliance of the friends of humanity in favour of the injured\r\nAfricans. Such an attempt throws a new lustre over your nation. It is\r\nnot yet, however, a national object in France; but the moment may\r\nperhaps come, and I shall think myself happy in preparing the way for\r\nit. You must be aware, however, of the difficulties which we shall have\r\nto encounter on our side of the water; for our colonies are much more\r\nconsiderable than yours; so that in the view of political interest we\r\nare not on an equal footing. It will therefore be necessary to find some\r\nmiddle line at first, as it cannot be expected that humanity alone will\r\nbe the governing principle of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nBut the day was now drawing near, when it was expected that this great\r\ncontest would be decided. Mr. Wilberforce, on the 19th of March, rose up\r\nin the House of Commons and desired the resolution to be read, by which\r\nthe house stood pledged to take the Slave Trade into their consideration\r\nin the then session; He then moved that the house should resolve itself\r\ninto a committee of the whole house on Thursday the 23rd of April, for\r\nthis purpose. This motion was agreed to; after which he moved for\r\ncertain official documents necessary to throw light upon the subject in\r\nthe course of its discussion.\r\n\r\nThis motion, by means of which the great day of trial was now fixed,\r\nseemed to be the signal for the planters, merchants, and other\r\ninterested persons to begin a furious opposition. Meetings were\r\naccordingly called by advertisement. At these meetings much warmth and\r\nvirulence were manifested in debate, and propositions breathing a spirit\r\nof anger were adopted. It was suggested there, in the vehemence of\r\npassion, that the islands could exist independently of the mother\r\ncountry; nor were even threats withheld to intimidate government from\r\neffecting the abolition.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, also, the public papers began to be filled with such\r\nstatements as were thought most likely to influence the members of the\r\nHouse of Commons, previously to the discussion of the question.\r\n\r\nThe first impression attempted to be made upon them was with respect to\r\nthe slaves themselves. It was contended, and attempted to be shown by\r\nthe revival of the old argument of human sacrifices in Africa, that\r\nthese were better off in the islands than in their own country. It was\r\ncontended, also, that they were people of very inferior capacities, and\r\nbut little removed from the brute creation; whence an inference was\r\ndrawn that their treatment, against which so much clamour had arisen,\r\nwas adapted to their intellect and feelings.\r\n\r\nThe next attempt was to degrade the abolitionists in the opinion of the\r\nhouse, by showing the wildness and absurdity of their schemes. It was\r\nagain insisted upon that emancipation was the real, object of the\r\nformer; so that thousands of slaves would be let loose in the islands to\r\nrob or perish, and who could never be brought back again into habits of\r\nuseful industry.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was then made to excite their pity in behalf of the planters.\r\nThe abolition, it was said, would produce insurrections among the\r\nslaves. But insurrections would produce the massacre of their masters;\r\nand, if any of these should happily escape from butchery, they would be\r\nreserved only for ruin.\r\n\r\nAn appeal was then made to them on the ground of their own interest and\r\nof that of the people whom they represented. It was stated that the ruin\r\nof the islands would be the ruin of themselves and of the country. Its\r\nrevenue would be half annihilated; its naval strength would decay.\r\nMerchants, manufacturers and others would come to beggary. But in this\r\ndeplorable situation they would expect to be indemnified for their\r\nlosses. Compensation, indeed, must follow: it could not be withheld. But\r\nwhat would be the amount of it? The country would have no less than from\r\neighty to a hundred millions to pay the sufferers; and it would be\r\ndriven to such distress in paying this sum as it had never before\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nThe last attempt was to show them that a regulation of the trade was all\r\nthat was now wanted. While this would remedy the evils complained of, it\r\nwould prevent the mischief which would assuredly follow the abolition.\r\nThe planters had already done their part. The assemblies of the\r\ndifferent islands had most of them made wholesome laws upon the subject.\r\nThe very bills passed for this purpose in Jamaica and Grenada had\r\narrived in England, and might be seen by the public; the great\r\ngrievances had been redressed; no slave could now be mutilated or\r\nwantonly killed by his owner; one man could not now maltreat, or bruise,\r\nor wound the slave of another; the aged could not now be turned off to\r\nperish by hunger. There were laws, also, relative to the better feeding\r\nand clothing of the slaves. It remained only that the trade to Africa\r\nshould be put under as wise and humane regulations as the slavery in the\r\nislands had undergone.\r\n\r\nThese different statements, appearing now in the public papers from day\r\nto day, began, in this early stage of the question, when the subject in\r\nall its bearings was known but to few, to make a considerable impression\r\nupon those, who were soon to be called to the decision of it. But that\r\nwhich had the greatest effect upon them, was the enormous amount of the\r\ncompensation, which, it was said, must be made. This statement against\r\nthe abolition was making its way so powerfully, that Archdeacon Paley\r\nthought it his duty to write, and to send to the committee, a little\r\ntreatise called _Arguments against the unjust Pretensions of Slave\r\nDealers and Holders, to be indemnified by pecuniary Allowances at the\r\npublic expense, in case the Slave Trade should be abolished_. This\r\ntreatise, when the substance of it was detailed in the public papers,\r\nhad its influence upon several members of the House of Commons; but\r\nthere were others who had been, as it were, panic-struck by the\r\nstatement. These in their fright seemed to have lost the right use of\r\ntheir eyes, or to have looked through a magnifying glass. With these the\r\nargument of emancipation, which they would have rejected at another time\r\nas ridiculous, obtained now easy credit. The massacres too, and the\r\nruin, though only conjectural, they admitted also. Hence some of them\r\ndeserted our cause wholly, while others, wishing to do justice as far as\r\nthey could to the slaves on the one hand, and to their own countrymen on\r\nthe other, adopted a middle line of conduct, and would go no further\r\nthan the regulation of the trade.\r\n\r\nWhile these preparations were making by our opponents to prejudice the\r\nminds of those who were to be the judges in this contest, Mr. Pitt\r\npresented the privy council report at the bar of the House of Commons;\r\nand as it was a large folio volume, and contained the evidence upon\r\nwhich the question was to be decided, it was necessary that time should\r\nbe given to the members to peruse it. Accordingly, the 12th of May was\r\nappointed, instead of the 23rd of April, for the discussion of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThis postponement of the discussion of the question gave time to all\r\nparties to prepare themselves further. The merchants and planters\r\navailed themselves of it to collect petitions to parliament from\r\ninterested persons, against the abolition of the trade, to wait upon\r\nmembers of parliament by deputation, in order to solicit their\r\nattendance in their favour, and to renew their injurious paragraphs in\r\nthe public papers. The committee for the abolition availed themselves of\r\nit to reply to these; and here Dr. Dickson, who had been secretary to\r\nGovernor Hey, in Barbados, and who had offered the committee his\r\n_Letters on Slavery_ before mentioned, and his services also, was of\r\nsingular use. Many members of parliament availed themselves of it to\r\nretire into the country to read the report. Among the latter were Mr.\r\nWilberforce and Mr. Pitt. In this retirement they discovered,\r\nnotwithstanding the great disadvantages under which we had laboured with\r\nrespect to evidence, that our cause was safe, and that, as far as it was\r\nto be decided by reason and sound policy, it would triumph. It was in\r\nthis retirement that Mr. Pitt made those able calculations which\r\nsatisfied him for ever after, as the minister of the country, as to the\r\nsafety of the great measure of the abolition of the Slave Trade; for he\r\nhad clearly proved, that not only the islands could go on in a\r\nflourishing state without supplies from the coast of Africa, but that\r\nthey were then in a condition to do it.\r\n\r\nAt length the 12th of May arrived. Mr. Wilberforce rose up in the\r\nCommons and moved the order of the day for the house to resolve itself\r\ninto a committee of the whole house, to take into consideration the\r\npetitions which had been presented against the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nThis order having been read, he moved that the report of the committee\r\nof privy council, that the acts passed in the islands relative to\r\nslaves, that the evidence adduced last year on the Slave Trade, that the\r\npetitions offered in the last session against the Slave Trade, and that\r\nthe accounts presented to the house in the last and present session\r\nrelative to the exports and imports of Africa, be referred to the same\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThese motions having been severally agreed to, the House immediately\r\nresolved itself into a committee of the whole house, and Sir William\r\nDolben was put into the chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilberforce began by declaring, that when he considered how much\r\ndiscussion the subject, which he was about to explain to the committee,\r\nhad occasioned, not only in that House, but throughout the kingdom, and\r\nthroughout Europe; and when he considered the extent and importance of\r\nit, the variety of interests involved in it, and the consequences which\r\nmight arise, he owned he had been filled with apprehensions, lest a\r\nsubject of such magnitude, and a cause of such weight, should suffer\r\nfrom the weakness of its advocate; but when he recollected that, in the\r\nprogress of his inquiries, he had everywhere been received with candour,\r\nthat most people gave him credit for the purity of his motives, and\r\nthat, however many of these might then differ from him, they were all\r\nlikely to agree in the end, he had dismissed his fears, and marched\r\nforward with a firmer step in this cause of humanity, justice, and\r\nreligion. He could not, however, but lament that the subject had excited\r\nso much warmth. He feared that too many on this account were but ill\r\nprepared to consider it with impartiality. He entreated all such to\r\nendeavour to be calm and composed. A fair and cool discussion was\r\nessentially necessary. The motion he meant to offer, was as reconcilable\r\nto political expediency as to national humanity. It belonged to no party\r\nquestion. It would in the end be found serviceable to all parties, and\r\nto the best interests of the country. He did not come forward to accuse\r\nthe West India planter, or the Liverpool merchant, or indeed any one\r\nconcerned in this traffic; but, if blame attached anywhere, to take\r\nshame to himself in common, indeed, with the whole parliament of Great\r\nBritain, who, having suffered it to be carried on under their own\r\nauthority, were all of them participators in the guilt.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to explain the great business of the day, he said he\r\nshould call the attention of the House only to the leading features of\r\nthe Slave Trade. Nor should he dwell long upon these. Every one might\r\nimagine for himself what must be the natural consequence of such a\r\ncommerce with Africa. Was it not plain that she must suffer from it?\r\nthat her savage manners must be rendered still more ferocious? and that\r\na trade of this nature, carried on round her coasts, must extend\r\nviolence and desolation to her very centre? It was well known that the\r\nnatives of Africa were sold as goods, and that numbers of them were\r\ncontinually conveyed away from their country by the owners of British\r\nvessels. The question then was, which way the latter came by them. In\r\nanswer to this question, the privy council report, which was then on the\r\ntable, afforded evidence the most satisfactory and conclusive. He had\r\nfound things in it, which had confirmed every proposition he had\r\nmaintained before, whether this proposition had been gathered from\r\nliving information of the best authority, or from the histories he had\r\nread. But it was unnecessary either to quote the report, or to appeal to\r\nhistory on this occasion. Plain reason and common sense would point out\r\nhow the poor Africans were obtained. Africa was a country divided into\r\nmany kingdoms, which had different governments and laws. In many parts\r\nthe princes were despotic. In others they had a limited rule. But in all\r\nof them, whatever the nature of the government was, men were considered\r\nas goods and property, and, as such, subject to plunder in the same\r\nmanner as property in other countries. The persons in power there were\r\nnaturally fond of our commodities; and to obtain them, (which could only\r\nbe done by the sale of their countrymen,) they waged war on one another,\r\nor even ravaged their own country, when they could find no pretence for\r\nquarrelling with their neighbours: in their courts of law many poor\r\nwretches, who were innocent, were condemned; and to obtain these\r\ncommodities in greater abundance, thousands were kidnapped and torn from\r\ntheir families, and sent into slavery. Such transactions, he said, were\r\nrecorded in every history of Africa, and the report on the table\r\nconfirmed them. With respect, however, to these he should make but one\r\nor two observations. If we looked into the reign of Henry the Eighth, we\r\nshould find a parallel for one of them. We should find that similar\r\nconvictions took place; and that penalties followed conviction. With\r\nrespect to wars, the kings of Africa were never induced to engage in\r\nthem by public principles, by national glory, and least of all by the\r\nlove of their people. This had been stated by those most conversant in\r\nthe subject, by Dr. Spaarman and Mr. Wadstrom. They had conversed with\r\nthese princes, and had learned from their own mouths that to procure\r\nslaves was the object of their hostilities. Indeed, there was scarcely a\r\nsingle person examined before the privy council who did not prove that\r\nthe Slave Trade was the source of the tragedies acted upon that\r\nextensive continent. Some had endeavoured to palliate this circumstance;\r\nbut there was not one who did not more or less admit it to be true. By\r\none the Slave Trade was called the concurrent cause, by the majority it\r\nwas acknowledged to be the principal motive, of the African wars. The\r\nsame might be said with respect to those instances of treachery and\r\ninjustice, in which individuals were concerned. And here he was sorry to\r\nobserve that our own countrymen were often guilty. He would only at\r\npresent advert to the tragedy at Calabar, where two-large African\r\nvillages, having been for some time at war, made peace. This peace was\r\nto have, been ratified by intermarriages; but some of our captains, who\r\nwere there, seeing their trade would be stopped for a while, sowed\r\ndissension again between them. They actually set one village against the\r\nother, took a share in the contest, massacred many of the inhabitants,\r\nand carried others of them away as slaves. But shocking as this\r\ntransaction might appear, there was not a single history of Africa to be\r\nread, in which scenes of as atrocious a nature were not related. They,\r\nhe said, who defended this trade, were warped and blinded by their own\r\ninterests, and would not be convinced of the miseries they were daily\r\nheaping on their fellow creatures. By the countenance, they gave it,\r\nthey had reduced the inhabitants of Africa to a worse state than that of\r\nthe most barbarous nation. They had destroyed what ought to have been\r\nthe bond of union and safety among them; they had introduced discord and\r\nanarchy among them; they had set kings against their subjects, and\r\nsubjects against each other; they had rendered every private family\r\nwretched; they had, in short, given birth to scenes of injustice and\r\nmisery not to be found in any other quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much on the subject of procuring slaves in, Africa, he\r\nwould now go to that of the transportation of them. And here he had\r\nfondly hoped, that when men with affections and feelings like our own\r\nhad been torn from their country, and everything dear to them, he should\r\nhave found some mitigation of their sufferings; but the sad reverse was\r\nthe case. This was the most wretched part of the whole subject. He was\r\nincapable, of impressing the House with what he felt upon it. A\r\ndescription of their conveyance was impossible. So much misery\r\ncondensed, in so little room was more than the human imagination had\r\never before conceived. Think only of six hundred persons linked\r\ntogether, trying to get rid of each other, crammed in a close vessel\r\nwith every object that was nauseous and disgusting, diseased, and\r\nstruggling with all the varieties of wretchedness. It seemed impossible\r\nto add anything more to human misery. Yet shocking as this description\r\nmust be felt to be by every man, the transportation had been described\r\nby several witnesses from Liverpool to be a comfortable conveyance. Mr.\r\nNorris had painted the accommodations on board a slave-ship in the most\r\nglowing colours. He had represented them in a manner which would have\r\nexceeded his attempts at praise of the most luxurious scenes. Their\r\napartments, he said, were fitted up as advantageously for them as\r\ncircumstances could possibly admit: they had several meals a day; some\r\nof their own country provisions, with the best sauces of African\r\ncookery; and, by way of variety, another meal of pulse, according to the\r\nEuropean taste. After breakfast they had water to wash themselves, while\r\ntheir apartments were perfumed with frankincense and lime-juice. Before\r\ndinner they were amused after the manner of their country; instruments\r\nof music were introduced; the song and the dance were promoted; games of\r\nchance were furnished them; the men played and sang, while the women and\r\ngirls made fanciful ornaments from beads, with which they were\r\nplentifully supplied. They were indulged in all their little fancies,\r\nand kept in sprightly humour. Another of them had said, when the sailors\r\nwere flogged, it was out of the hearing of the Africans, lest it should\r\ndepress their spirits. He by no means wished to say that such\r\ndescriptions were wilful misrepresentations. If they were not, it proved\r\nthat interest or prejudice was capable of spreading a film over the eyes\r\nthick enough to occasion total blindness.\r\n\r\nOthers, however, and these men of the greatest veracity, had given a\r\ndifferent account. What would the house think, when by the concurring\r\ntestimony of these the true history was laid open? The slaves who had\r\nbeen described as rejoicing in their captivity, were so wrung with\r\nmisery at leaving their country, that it was the constant practice to\r\nset sail in the night, lest they should know the moment of their\r\ndeparture. With respect to their accommodation, the right ancle of one\r\nwas fastened to the left ancle of another by an iron fetter; and if they\r\nwere turbulent, by another on the wrists. Instead of the apartments\r\ndescribed, they were placed in niches, and along the decks, in such a\r\nmanner, that it was impossible for any one to pass among them, however\r\ncareful he might be, without treading upon them. Sir George Yonge had\r\ntestified, that in a slave-ship, on board of which he went, and which\r\nhad not completed her cargo by two hundred and fifty, instead of the\r\nscent of frankincense being perceptible to the nostrils, the stench was\r\nintolerable. The allowance of water was, so deficient, that the slaves\r\nwere, frequently found gasping for life, and almost suffocated. The\r\npulse with which they had been said to be favoured, were absolutely\r\nEnglish horse-beans. The legislature of Jamaica had stated the\r\nscantiness both of water and provisions, as a subject which called for\r\nthe interference of parliament. As Mr. Norris had said, the song and the\r\ndance were promoted, he could not pass over these expressions without\r\ntelling the house what they meant. It would have been much more fair if\r\nhe himself had explained the word _promoted_. The truth was, that, for\r\nthe sake of exercise, these miserable wretches, loaded with chains and\r\noppressed with disease, were forced to dance by the terror of the lash,\r\nand sometimes by the actual use of it. \"I\" said one of the evidences,\r\n\"was employed to dance the men, while another person danced the women.\"\r\nSuch then was the meaning of the, word _promoted_; and it might also be\r\nobserved with respect to food, that instruments were sometimes carried\r\nout in order to force them to eat; which was the same sort of proof, how\r\nmuch they enjoyed themselves in this instance also. With respect to\r\ntheir singing, it consisted of songs, of lamentation for the loss of\r\ntheir country. While they sung they were in tears: so that one of the\r\ncaptains, more humane probably than the rest, threatened a woman with a\r\nflogging because the mournfulness of her song was too painful for his\r\nfeelings. Perhaps he could not give a better proof of the sufferings of\r\nthese injured people during their passage, than by stating the mortality\r\nwhich accompanied it. This was a species of evidence, which was\r\ninfallible on this occasion. Death was a witness which could not deceive\r\nthem; and the proportion of deaths would not only confirm, but, if\r\npossible, even aggravate our suspicion of the misery of the transit. It\r\nwould be found, upon an average of all the ships, upon which evidence\r\nhad been given, that, exclusively of such as perished before they sailed\r\nfrom Africa, not less than twelve and-a-half per cent died on their\r\npassage: besides these, the Jamaica report stated that four and-a-half\r\nper cent died while in the harbours, or on shore before the day of sale,\r\nwhich was only about the space of twelve or fourteen days after their\r\narrival there; and one-third more died in the seasoning: and this in a\r\nclimate exactly similar to their own, and where, as some of the\r\nwitnesses pretended, they were healthy and happy. Thus out of every lot\r\nof one hundred shipped from Africa, seventeen died in about nine weeks,\r\nand not more than fifty lived to become effective labourers in our\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nHaving advanced thus far in his investigation, he felt, he said, the\r\nwickedness of the Slave Trade to be so enormous, so dreadful, and\r\nirremediable, that he could stop at no alternative short of its\r\nabolition, A trade founded on iniquity, and carried on with such\r\ncircumstances of horror, must be abolished, let the policy of it be what\r\nit might; and he had from this time determined, whatever were the\r\nconsequences, that he would never rest till he had effected that\r\nabolition. His mind had, indeed, been harassed by the objections of the\r\nWest India planters, who had asserted, that the ruin of their property\r\nmust be the consequence of such a measure. He could not help, however,\r\ndistrusting their arguments. He could not believe that the Almighty\r\nBeing, who had forbidden the practice of rapine and bloodshed, had made\r\nrapine and bloodshed necessary to any part of his universe. He felt a\r\nconfidence in this persuasion, and took the resolution to act upon it.\r\nLight, indeed, soon broke in upon him. The suspicion of his mind was\r\nevery day confirmed by increasing information, and the evidence he had\r\nnow to offer upon this point was decisive and complete. The principle\r\nupon which he founded the necessity of the abolition was not policy, but\r\njustice: but though justice were the principle of the measure, yet he\r\ntrusted he should distinctly prove it to be reconcilable with our truest\r\npolitical interest.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he asserted that the number of the slaves in our\r\nWest India islands might be kept up without the introduction of recruits\r\nfrom Africa; and to prove this, he would enumerate the different sources\r\nof their mortality. The first was the disproportion of the sexes, there\r\nbeing, upon an average, about five males imported to three females: but\r\nthis evil, when the Slave Trade was abolished, would cure itself. The\r\nsecond consisted in the bad condition in which they were brought to the\r\nislands, and the methods of preparing them for sale. They arrived\r\nfrequently in a sickly and disordered state, and then they were made up\r\nfor the market by the application of astringents, washes, mercurial\r\nointments, and repelling drugs, so that their wounds and diseases might\r\nbe hid. These artifices were not only fraudulent but fatal; but these,\r\nit was obvious, would of themselves fall with the trade. A third was,\r\nexcessive labour joined with improper food; and a fourth was, the\r\nextreme dissoluteness of their manners. These, also, would both of them\r\nbe counteracted by the impossibility of getting further supplies: for\r\nowners, now unable to replace those slaves whom they might lose, by\r\nspeedy purchases in the markets, would be more careful how they treated\r\nthem in future, and a better treatment would be productive of better\r\nmorals. And here he would just advert to an argument used against those\r\nwho complained of cruelty in our islands, which was, that it was the\r\ninterest of masters to treat their slaves with humanity: but surely it\r\nwas immediate and present, not future and distant interest, which was\r\nthe great spring of action in the affairs of mankind. Why did we make\r\nlaws to punish men? It was their interest to be upright and virtuous:\r\nbut there was a present impulse continually breaking in upon their\r\nbetter judgment, and an impulse, which was known to be contrary to their\r\npermanent advantage. It was ridiculous to say that men would be bound by\r\ntheir interest, when gain or ardent passion urged them. It might as well\r\nbe asserted, that a stone could not be thrown into the air, or a body\r\nmove from place to place, because the principle of gravitation bound\r\nthem to the surface of the earth. If a planter in the West Indies found\r\nhimself reduced in his profits, he did not usually dispose of any part\r\nof his slaves; and his own gratifications were never given up, so long\r\nas there was a possibility of making any retrenchment in the allowance\r\nof his slaves.--But to return to the subject which he had left: he was\r\nhappy to state, that as all the causes of the decrease which he had\r\nstated might be remedied, so, by the progress of light and reformation,\r\nthese remedies had been gradually coming into practice; and that, as\r\nthese had increased, the decrease of slaves had in an equal proportion\r\nbeen lessened. By the gradual adoption of these remedies, he could prove\r\nfrom the report on the table, that the decrease of slaves in Jamaica had\r\nlessened to such a degree, that from the year 1774 to the present it was\r\nnot quite one in a hundred, and that, in fact, they were at present in a\r\nstate of increase; for that the births in that island, at this moment,\r\nexceeded the deaths by one thousand or eleven hundred per annum.\r\nBarbados, Nevis, Antigua, and the Bermudas, were, like Jamaica,\r\nlessening their decrease, and holding forth an evident and reasonable\r\nexpectation of a speedy state of increase by natural population. But\r\nallowing the number of Negroes even to decrease for a time, there were\r\nmethods which would insure the welfare of the West India islands. The\r\nlands there might be cultivated by fewer hands, and this to greater\r\nadvantage to the proprietors and to this country, by the produce of\r\ncinnamon, coffee, and cotton, than by that of sugar. The produce of the\r\nplantations might also be considerably increased, even in the case of\r\nsugar, with less hands than were at present employed, if the owners of\r\nthem would but introduce machines of husbandry. Mr. Long himself, long\r\nresident as a planter, had proved, upon his own estate, that the plough,\r\nthough so little used in the West Indies, did the service of a hundred\r\nslaves, and caused the same ground to produce three hogsheads of sugar,\r\nwhich, when cultivated by slaves, would only produce two. The division\r\nof work, which, in free and civilized countries, was the grand source of\r\nwealth, and the reduction of the number of domestic servants, of whom\r\nnot less than from twenty to forty were kept in ordinary families,\r\nafforded other resources for this purpose. But, granting that all these\r\nsuppositions should be unfounded, and that everyone of these substitutes\r\nshould fail for a time, the planters would be indemnified, as is the\r\ncase in all transactions of commerce, by the increased price of their\r\nproduce in the British market. Thus, by contending against the\r\nabolition, they were defeated in every part of the argument. But he\r\nwould never give up the point, that the number of the slaves could be\r\nkept up, by natural population, and without any dependence whatever on\r\nthe Slave Trade. He therefore called upon the house again to abolish it\r\nas a criminal waste of life--it was utterly unnecessary--he had proved\r\nit so by documents contained in the report. The merchants of Liverpool,\r\nindeed, had thought otherwise, but he should be cautious how he assented\r\nto their opinions. They declared last year that it was a losing trade at\r\ntwo slaves to a ton, and yet they pursued it when restricted to five\r\nslaves to three tons. He believed, however, that it was upon the whole a\r\nlosing concern; in the same manner as the lottery would be a losing\r\nadventure to any company who should buy all the tickets. Here and there\r\nan individual gained a large prize, but the majority of adventurers\r\ngained nothing. The same merchants, too, had asserted, that the town of\r\nLiverpool would be mined by the abolition. But Liverpool did not depend\r\nfor its consequence upon the Slave Trade. The whole export-tonnage from\r\nthat place amounted to no less than 170,000 tons; whereas the export\r\npart of it to Africa amounted only to 13,000. Liverpool, he was sure,\r\nowed its greatness to other and very different causes; the Slave Trade\r\nbearing but a small proportion to its other trade.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through that part of the subject which related to the\r\nslaves, he would now answer two objections which he had frequently heard\r\nstated. The first of these was, that the abolition of the Slave Trade\r\nwould operate to the total ruin of our navy, and to the increase of that\r\nof our rivals. For an answer to these assertions, he referred to what he\r\nconsidered to be the most valuable part of the report, and for which the\r\nHouse and the country were indebted to the indefatigable exertions of\r\nMr. Clarkson. By the report it appeared, that, instead of the Slave\r\nTrade being a nursery for British seamen, it was their grave. It\r\nappeared that more seamen died in that trade in one year than in the\r\nwhole remaining trade of the country in two. Out of 910 sailors in it,\r\n216 died in the year, while upon a fair average of the same number of\r\nmen employed in the trades to the East and West Indies, Petersburgh,\r\nNewfoundland, and Greenland, no more than eighty-seven died. It appeared\r\nalso, that out of 3170, who had left Liverpool in the slave-ships in the\r\nyear 1787, only 1428 had returned. And here, while he lamented the loss\r\nwhich the country thus annually sustained in her seamen, he had\r\nadditionally to lament the barbarous usage which they experienced, and\r\nwhich this trade, by its natural tendency to harden the heart,\r\nexclusively produced. He would just read an extract of a letter from\r\nGovernor Parrey, of Barbados, to Lord Sydney, one of the secretaries of\r\nstate. The Governor declared he could no longer contain himself on\r\naccount of the ill treatment, which the British sailors endured at the\r\nhands of their savage captains. These were obliged to have their vessels\r\nstrongly manned, not only on account of the unhealthiness of the climate\r\nof Africa, but of the necessity of guarding the slaves, and preventing\r\nand suppressing insurrections; and when they arrived in the West Indies,\r\nand were out of all danger from the latter, they quarrelled with their\r\nmen on the most frivolous pretences, on purpose to discharge them, and\r\nthus save the payment of supernumerary wages home. Thus many were left\r\nin a diseased and deplorable state; either to perish by sickness, or to\r\nenter into foreign service; great numbers of whom were for ever lost to\r\ntheir country. The Governor concluded by declaring, that the enormities\r\nattendant on this trade were so great, as to demand the immediate\r\ninterference of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe next objection to the abolition was, that if we were to relinquish\r\nthe Slave Trade, our rivals, the French, would take it up; so that,\r\nwhile we should suffer by the measure, the evil would still go on, and\r\nthis even to its former extent. This was, indeed, a very weak argument;\r\nand, if it would defend the continuance of the Slave Trade, might\r\nequally be urged in favour of robbery, murder, and every species of\r\nwickedness, which, if we did not practise, others would commit. But\r\nsuppose, for the sake of argument, that they were to take it up, what\r\ngood would it do them? What advantages, for instance, would they derive\r\nfrom this pestilential commerce to their marine? Should not we, on the\r\nother hand, be benefited by this change? Would they not be obliged to\r\ncome to us, in consequence of the cheapness of our manufactures, for\r\nwhat they wanted for the African market? But he would not calumniate the\r\nFrench nation so much as to suppose that they would carry on the trade,\r\nif we were to relinquish it. He believed, on the other hand, that they\r\nwould abolish it also. Mr. Necker, the minister of France, was a man of\r\nreligious principle; and, in his work upon the administration of the\r\nfinances, had recorded his abhorrence of this trade. He was happy also\r\nto relate an anecdote of the king of France, which proved that he was a\r\nfriend to the abolition; for, being petitioned to dissolve a society,\r\nformed at Paris, for the annihilation of the Slave Trade, his majesty\r\nanswered, that he would not, and was happy to hear that so humane an\r\nassociation was formed in his dominions. And here, having mentioned the\r\nsociety in Paris, he could not help paying a due compliment to that\r\nestablished in London for the same purpose, which had laboured with the\r\ngreatest assiduity to make this important subject understood, and which\r\nhad conducted itself with so much judgment and moderation as to have\r\ninterested men of all religions, and to have united them in their cause.\r\n\r\nThere was another topic which he would submit to the notice of the\r\nHouse, before he concluded. They were perhaps not aware that a fair and\r\nhonourable trade might be substituted in the natural productions of\r\nAfrica, so that our connexion with that continent in the way of\r\ncommercial advantage need not be lost. The natives had already made some\r\nadvances in it; and if they had not appeared so forward in raising and\r\ncollecting their own produce for sale as in some other countries, it was\r\nto be imputed to the Slave Trade: but remove the cause, and Africa would\r\nsoon emerge from her present ignorant and indolent state. Civilization\r\nwould go on with her as well as with other nations. Europe, three or\r\nfour centuries ago, was in many parts as barbarous as Africa at present,\r\nand chargeable with as bad practices. For what would be said, if, so\r\nlate as the middle of the thirteenth century, he could find a parallel\r\nthere for the Slave Trade?--Yes. This parallel was to be found even in\r\nEngland. The people of Bristol, in the reign of Henry the Seventh, had a\r\nregular market for children, which were bought by the Irish: but the\r\nlatter having experienced a general calamity, which they imputed as a\r\njudgment from Heaven on account of this wicked traffic, abolished it.\r\nThe only thing, therefore, which he had to solicit of the House, was to\r\nshow that they were now as enlightened as the Irish were four centuries\r\nback, by refusing to buy the children of other nations. He hoped they\r\nwould do it. He hoped, too, they would do it in an unqualified manner.\r\nNothing less than a total abolition of the trade would do away the evils\r\ncomplained of. The legislature of Jamaica, indeed, had thought that\r\nregulations might answer the purpose. Their report had recommended, that\r\nno person should be kidnapped, or permitted to be made a slave, contrary\r\nto the customs of Africa. But might he not be reduced to this state very\r\nunjustly, and yet by no means contrary to the African laws? Besides, how\r\ncould we distinguish between those who were justly or unjustly reduced\r\nto it? Could we discover them by their physiognomy?--But if we could,\r\nwho would believe that the British captains would be influenced by any\r\nregulations; made in this country, to refuse to purchase those who had\r\nnot been fairly, honestly? and uprightly enslaved? They who were offered\r\nto us for sale, were brought, some of them, three or four thousand\r\nmiles, and exchanged like cattle from one hand to another, till they\r\nreached the coast. But who could return these to their homes, or make\r\nthem compensation for their sufferings during their long journeyings? He\r\nwould now conclude by begging pardon of the House for having detained\r\nthem so long. He could indeed have expressed his own conviction in fewer\r\nwords. He needed only to have made one or two short statements, and to\r\nhave quoted the commandment, \"Thou shalt do no murder.\" But he thought\r\nit his duty to lay the whole of the case, and the whole of its guilt,\r\nbefore them. They would see now that no mitigations, no palliatives,\r\nwould either be efficient or admissible. Nothing short of an absolute\r\nabolition could be adopted. This they owed to Africa: they owed it, too,\r\nto their own moral characters. And he hoped they would follow up the\r\nprinciple of one of the repentant African captains, who had gone before\r\nthe committee of privy council as a voluntary witness, and that they\r\nwould make Africa all the atonement in their power for the multifarious\r\ninjuries she had received at the hands of British subjects. With respect\r\nto these injuries, their enormity and extent, it might be alleged in\r\ntheir excuse, that they were not fully acquainted with them till that\r\nmoment, and therefore not answerable for their former existence: but now\r\nthey could no longer plead ignorance concerning them. They had seen them\r\nbrought directly before their eyes, and they must decide for themselves,\r\nand must justify to the world and their own consciences the facts and\r\nprinciples upon which their decision was formed.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilberforce having concluded his speech, which lasted three hours\r\nand a half, read, and laid on the table of the House, as subjects for\r\ntheir future discussion, twelve propositions which he had deduced from\r\nthe evidence contained in the privy council report, and of which the\r\nfollowing is the abridged substance:--\r\n\r\n1. That the number of slaves annually carried from the coast of Africa,\r\nin British vessels, was about 38,000, of which, on an average, 22,500\r\nwere carried to the British islands, and that of the latter only 17,500\r\nwere retained there.\r\n\r\n2. That these slaves, according to the evidence on the table, consisted,\r\nfirst, of prisoners of war; secondly, of free persons sold for debt, or\r\non account of real or imputed crimes, particularly adultery and\r\nwitchcraft; in which cases they were frequently sold with their whole\r\nfamilies, and sometimes for the profit of those by whom they were\r\ncondemned; thirdly, of domestic slaves sold for the profit of their\r\nmasters, in some places at the will of the masters, and in others, on\r\nbeing condemned by them for real or imputed crimes; fourthly, of persons\r\nmade slaves by various acts of oppression, violence, or fraud, committed\r\neither by the princes and chiefs of those countries on their subjects,\r\nor by private individuals on each other; or, lastly, by Europeans\r\nengaged in this traffic.\r\n\r\n3. That the trade so carried on, had necessarily a tendency to occasion\r\nfrequent and cruel wars among the natives; to produce unjust convictions\r\nand punishments for pretended or aggravated crimes; to encourage acts of\r\noppression, violence, and fraud, and to obstruct the natural course of\r\ncivilization and improvement in those countries!\r\n\r\n4. That Africa in its present state furnished several valuable articles\r\nof commerce, which were partly peculiar to itself, but that it was\r\nadapted to the production of others, with which we were now either\r\nwholly or in great part supplied by foreign nations. That an extensive\r\ncommerce with Africa might be substituted in these commodities, so as to\r\nafford a return for as many articles as had annually been carried\r\nthither in British vessels: and, lastly, that such a commerce might\r\nreasonably be expected to increase, by the progress of civilization\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n5. That the Slave Trade was peculiarly destructive to the seamen\r\nemployed in it; and that the mortality there had been much greater than\r\nin any British vessels employed upon the same coast in any other service\r\nor trade.\r\n\r\n6. That the mode of transporting the slaves from Africa to the West\r\nIndies necessarily exposed them to many and grievous sufferings, for\r\nwhich no regulations could provide an adequate remedy; and that in\r\nconsequence thereof a large proportion had annually perished during the\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\n7. That a large proportion had also perished in the harbours in the West\r\nIndies, from the diseases contracted in the voyage, and the treatment of\r\nthe same, previously to their being sold; and that this loss amounted to\r\nfour and a half percent of the imported slaves.\r\n\r\n8. That the loss of the newly-imported slaves, within the three first\r\nyears after their importation, bore a large proportion to the whole\r\nnumber imported.\r\n\r\n9. That the natural increase of population among the slaves in the\r\nislands appeared to have been impeded principally by the following\r\ncauses:--First, by the inequality of the sexes in the importations from\r\nAfrica. Secondly, by the general dissoluteness of manners among the\r\nslaves, and the want of proper regulations for the encouragement of\r\nmarriages, and of rearing children among them. Thirdly, by the\r\nparticular diseases which were prevalent among them, and which were, in\r\nsome instances, to be attributed to too severe labour, or rigorous\r\ntreatment; and in others to insufficient or improper food. Fourthly, by\r\nthose diseases, which affected a large proportion of negro-children in\r\ntheir infancy, and by those to which the negroes, newly imported from\r\nAfrica, had been found to be particularly liable.\r\n\r\n10. That the whole number of the slaves in the island of Jamaica, in\r\n1768, was about 167,000, in 1774, about 193,000, and in 1787, about\r\n256,000: that by comparing these numbers with the numbers imported and\r\nretained in the said island during all these years, and making proper\r\nallowances, the annual excess of deaths above births was in the\r\nproportion of about seven-eighths per cent.; that in the first six years\r\nof this period it was in the proportion of rather more than one on every\r\nhundred; that in the last thirteen years of the same it was in the\r\nproportion of about three-fifths on every hundred; and that a number of\r\nslaves, amounting to fifteen thousand, perished during the latter\r\nperiod, in consequence of repeated hurricanes, and of the want of\r\nforeign supplies of provisions.\r\n\r\n11. That the whole number of slaves in the island of Barbados was, in\r\nthe year, 1764, about 70,706; in 1774, about 74,874; in 1780, about\r\n68,270; in 1781, after the hurricane, about 63,248, and in 1786, about\r\n62,115; that, by comparing these numbers with the number imported into\r\nthis island, (not allowing for any re-exportation,) the annual excess of\r\ndeaths above births in the ten years, from 1764 to 1774, was in, the\r\nproportion of about five on every hundred; that in the seven years, from\r\n1774 to 1780, it was in the proportion of about one and one-third on\r\nevery hundred; that between the years 1780 and 1781 there had been a\r\ndecrease in the number of slaves, of about 5000; that in the six years,\r\nfrom 1781 to 1786, the excess of deaths was in the proportion of rather\r\nless than seven-eighths on every hundred; that in the four years, from,\r\n1783 to 1786, it was in the proportion of rather less than one-third on\r\nevery hundred; and that during the whole period, there was no doubt that\r\nsome had been exported from the island, but considerably more in the\r\nfirst part of this period than in the last.\r\n\r\n12. That the accounts from the Leeward Islands, and from Dominica,\r\nGrenada, and St. Vincent's, did not furnish sufficient grounds for\r\ncomparing the state of population in the said islands, at different\r\nperiods, with the number of slaves, which had been from time to time\r\nimported there, and exported therefrom; but that from the evidence which\r\nhad been received, respecting the present state of these islands, as\r\nwell as that of Jamaica and Barbados, and from a consideration of the\r\nmeans of obviating the causes, which had hitherto operated to impede the\r\nnatural increase of the slaves, and of lessening the demand for manual\r\nlabour, without diminishing the profit of the planters, no considerable\r\nor permanent inconvenience would result from discontinuing the further\r\nimportation of African slaves.\r\n\r\nThese propositions having been laid upon the table of the House, Lord\r\nPenrhyn rose in behalf of the planters; and next, after him, Mr.\r\nGascoyne, (both members for Liverpool,) in behalf of the  merchants\r\nconcerned in the latter place. They both predicted the ruin and misery\r\nwhich would inevitably follow the abolition of the trade. The former\r\nsaid, that no less than seventy millions were mortgaged upon lands in\r\nthe West Indies, all of which would be lost. Mr. Wilberforce, therefore,\r\nshould have made a motion to pledge the House to the repayment of this\r\nsum, before he had brought forward his propositions. Compensation ought\r\nto have been agreed upon as a previous necessary measure. The latter\r\nsaid, that in consequence of the bill of last year, many ships were laid\r\nup, and many seamen out of employ. His constituents had large capitals\r\nengaged in the trade, and, if it were to be wholly done away, they would\r\nsuffer from not knowing where to employ them: they both joined in\r\nasserting, that Mr. Wilberforce had made so many misrepresentations in\r\nall the branches of this subject, that no reliance whatever was to be\r\nplaced on the picture, which he had chosen to exhibit. They should\r\nspeak, however, more fully to this point when the propositions were\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nThe latter declaration called up Mr. Wilberforce again, who observed\r\nthat he had no intention of misrepresenting any fact: he did not know\r\nthat he had done it in any one instance; but, if he had, it would be\r\neasy to convict him out of the report upon the table.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke then rose. He would not, he said, detain the committee long:\r\nindeed, he was not able, weary and indisposed as he then felt himself,\r\neven if he had an inclination to do it; but as on account of his other\r\nparliamentary duty, he might not have it in his power to attend the\r\nbusiness now before them in its course, he would take that opportunity\r\nof stating his opinion upon it.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, the House, the nation, and all Europe were under great\r\nobligations to Mr. Wilberforce for having brought this important subject\r\nforward. He had done it in a manner the most masterly, impressive, and\r\neloquent. He had laid down his principles so admirably, and with so much\r\norder and force, that his speech had equalled anything he had ever heard\r\nin modern oratory, and perhaps it had not been excelled by anything to\r\nbe found in ancient times. As to the Slave Trade itself, there could not\r\nbe two opinions about it, where men were not interested. A trade begun\r\nin savage war, prosecuted with unheard-of barbarity, continued during\r\nthe transportation with the most loathsome imprisonment, and ending in\r\nperpetual exile and slavery, was a trade so horrid in all in\r\ncircumstances, that it; was impossible to produce a single argument in\r\nits favour. On the ground of prudence, nothing could be said in defence\r\nof it, nor could it be justified by necessity. It was necessity alone\r\nthat could be brought to justify inhumanity; but no case of necessity\r\ncould be made out strong enough to justify this monstrous traffic. It\r\nwas therefore the duty of the House to put an end to it, and this\r\nwithout further delay. This conviction, that it became them to do it\r\nimmediately, made him regret (and it was the only thing he regretted in\r\nthe admirable speech he had heard) that his honourable friend should\r\nhave introduced propositions on this subject. He could have wished that\r\nthe business had been brought to a conclusion at once, without voting\r\nthe propositions which had been read to them. He was not over fond of\r\nabstract propositions; they were seldom necessary, and often occasioned\r\ngreat difficulty, embarrassment, and delay. There was, besides, no\r\noccasion whatever to assign detailed reasons for a vote, which nature\r\nherself dictated, and which religion enforced. If it should happen that\r\nthe propositions were not carried in that House or the other, such a\r\ncomplication of mischiefs might follow, as might occasion them heartily\r\nto lament that they were ever introduced. If the ultimate resolution\r\nshould happen to be lost, he was afraid the propositions would pass as\r\nwaste paper, if not be injurious to the cause at a future time.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the House must bring this matter to an issue, he would beg\r\ntheir attention to a particular point. He entreated them to look further\r\nthan the present moment, and to ask themselves if they had fortified\r\ntheir minds sufficiently to bear the consequences which might arise from\r\nthe abolition of the Slave Trade, supposing they should decide upon it.\r\nWhen they abandoned it, other foreign powers might take it up, and\r\nclandestinely supply our islands with slaves. Had they virtue enough to\r\nsee another country reaping profits, which they themselves had given up;\r\nand to abstain from that envy natural to rivals, and firmly to adhere to\r\ntheir determination? If so, let them thankfully proceed to vote the\r\nimmediate abolition of the Slave Trade. But if they should repent of\r\ntheir virtue, (and he had known miserable instances of such repentance,)\r\nall hopes of future reformation of this enormous evil would be lost.\r\nThey would go back to a trade they had abandoned with redoubled\r\nattachment, and would adhere to it with a degree of avidity and\r\nshameless ardour, to their own humiliation, and to the degradation and\r\ndisgrace of the nation in the eyes of all Europe. These were\r\nconsiderations worth regarding, before they took a decisive step in a\r\nbusiness, in which they ought not to move with any other determination\r\nthan to abide by the consequences at all hazards. The honourable\r\ngentleman (who to his eternal honour had introduced this great subject\r\nto their notice) had, in his eloquent oration, knocked at every door,\r\nand appealed to every passion, well knowing that mankind were governed\r\nby their sympathies. But there were other passions to be regarded; men\r\nwere always ready to obey their sympathies when it cost them nothing;\r\nbut were they prepared to pay the price of their virtue on this great\r\noccasion? This was the question. If they were, they would do themselves\r\nimmortal honour, and would have the satisfaction of having done away a\r\ncommerce, which, while it was productive of misery not to be described,\r\nmost of all hardened the heart and vitiated the human character.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the consequences mentioned by the two members for\r\nLiverpool, he had a word or two to offer upon them. Lord Penrhyn had\r\ntalked of millions to be lost and paid for; but seeing no probability of\r\nany loss ultimately, he could see no necessity for compensation. He\r\nbelieved on the other hand, that the planters would be great gainers by\r\nthose wholesome regulations, which they would be obliged to make, if the\r\nSlave Trade were abolished. He did not however flatter them with the\r\nidea that this gain would be immediate. Perhaps they might experience\r\ninconveniences at first, and even some loss. But what then? With their\r\nloss, their virtue would be the greater. And in this light he hoped the\r\nHouse would consider the matter; for, if they were called upon to do an\r\nact of virtuous energy and heroism, they ought to think it right to\r\nsubmit to temporary disadvantages for the sake of truth, justice,\r\nhumanity, and the prospect of greater happiness.\r\n\r\nThe other member, Mr. Gascoyne, had said that his constituents, if the\r\ntrade were abolished, could not employ their capitals elsewhere. But\r\nwhether they could or not, it was the duty of that House, if they put\r\nthem into a traffic which was shocking to humanity and disgraceful to\r\nthe nation, to change their application, and not to allow them to be\r\nused to a barbarous purpose. He believed, however, that the merchants of\r\nLiverpool would find no difficulty on this head. All capitals required\r\nactive motion; it was in their nature not to remain passive and\r\nunemployed; they would soon turn them into other channels. This they had\r\ndone themselves during the American war; for the Slave Trade was almost\r\nwholly lost, and yet they had their ships employed, either as transports\r\nin the service of government or in other ways.\r\n\r\nAnd as he now called upon the House not to allow any conjectural losses\r\nto become impediments in the way of the abolition of the Slave Trade, so\r\nhe called upon them to beware how they suffered any representations of\r\nthe happiness of the state of slavery in our islands to influence them\r\nagainst so glorious a measure. Admiral Barrington had said in his\r\ntestimony, that he had often envied the condition of the slaves there.\r\nBut surely, the honourable admiral must have meant, that, as he had\r\noften toiled like a slave in the defence of his country, (as his many\r\ngallant actions had proved,) so he envied the day when he was to toil in\r\na similar manner in the same cause. If, however, his words were to be\r\ntaken literally, his sensations could only be accounted for by his\r\nhaving seen the negroes in the hour of their sports, when a sense of the\r\nmisery of their condition was neither felt by themselves not visible to\r\nothers. But their appearance on such occasions did by no means disprove\r\ntheir low and abject state. Nothing made a happy slave but a degraded\r\nman. In proportion as the mind grows callous to its degradation, and all\r\nsense of manly pride is lost, the slave feels comfort. In fact, he is no\r\nlonger a man. If he were to define a man, he would say with Shakespeare,\r\n\r\n\r\n  Man is a being holding large discourse,\r\n  Looking before and after.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, a slave was incapable of looking before and after; he had no motive\r\nto do it; he was a mere passive instrument in the hands of others to be\r\nused at their discretion. Though living, he was, dead as to all\r\nvoluntary agency; though moving amidst the creation with an erect form,\r\nand with the shape and semblance of a human being, he was a nullity as a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt thanked his honourable friend Mr. Wilberforce for having at\r\nlength introduced this great and important subject to the consideration\r\nof the House. He thanked him also for the perspicuous, forcible, and\r\nmasterly manner in which he had treated it. He was sure that no argument\r\ncompatible with any idea of justice could be assigned for the\r\ncontinuation of the Slave Trade. And at the same time that he was\r\nwilling to listen with candour and attention to everything that could be\r\nurged on the other side of the question, he was sure that the\r\nprinciples, from which his opinion was deduced, were unalterable. He had\r\nexamined the subject with the anxiety which became him, where the\r\nhappiness and interests of so many thousands were concerned, and with\r\nthe minuteness which would be expected of him, on account of, the\r\nresponsible situation which he held; and he averred that it was\r\nsophistry, obscurity of ideas, and vagueness of reasoning, which alone\r\ncould have hitherto prevented all mankind (those immediately interested\r\nin the question excepted) from agreeing in one and the same opinion upon\r\nthe subject. With respect to the propriety of introducing the individual\r\npropositions which had been offered, he differed with Mr. Burke, and he\r\nthanked his honourable friend Mr. Wilberforce for having chosen the only\r\nway in which it could be made obvious to the worlds that they were\r\nwarranted on every ground of reason and of fact in coming to that vote,\r\nwhich he trusted would be the end of their proceeding. The grounds for\r\nthe attainment of this end were distinctly stated in the propositions.\r\nLet the propositions be brought before the House, one by one, and argued\r\nfrom the evidence, and it would then be seen that they were such as no\r\none, who was not deaf to the language of reason, could deny. Let them be\r\nonce entered upon the journals of that House, and it was almost\r\nimpossible they should fail. The abolition must be voted; as to the mode\r\nof it, or how it should be effected, they were not at present to discuss\r\nit; but he trusted it would be such as would not invite foreign powers\r\nto supply our islands with slaves by a clandestine trade. After a debt,\r\nfounded on the immutable principles of justice, was found to be due, it\r\nwas impossible but the country had means to cause it to be paid. Should\r\nsuch an illicit proceeding be attempted; the only language which it\r\nbecame us to adopt, was, that Great Britain had resources to enable her\r\nto protect her islands, and to prevent that traffic from being\r\nclandestinely carried on by them, which she had thought fit from a\r\nregard to her character to abandon. It was highly becoming Great Britain\r\nto take the lead of other nations in such a virtuous and magnificent\r\nmeasure, and he could not but have confidence that they would he\r\ninclined to share the honour with us, or be pleased to follow us as\r\ntheir example. If we were disposed to set about this glorious work in\r\nearnest, they might he invited to concur with us by a negotiation to be\r\nimmediately opened for that purpose. He would only now observe, before\r\nhe sat down, in answer to certain ideas thrown out, that he could by no\r\nmeans acquiesce in any compensation for losses which might be sustained\r\nby the people of Liverpool or by others in any other part of the\r\nkingdom, in the execution of this just and necessary undertaking.\r\n\r\nSir William Yonge said, he wanted no inducement to concur with the\r\nhonourable mover of the propositions, provided the latter could be\r\nfairly established, and no serious mischiefs were to arise from the\r\nabolition. But he was apprehensive, that many evils might follow in the\r\ncase of any sudden or unlooked-for decrease in the slaves. They might be\r\ndestroyed by hurricanes. They might be swept off by many fatal\r\ndisorders. In these cases, the owners of them would not be able to fill\r\nup their places, and they who had lent money upon the lands, where the\r\nlosses had happened, would foreclose their mortgages. He was fearful,\r\nalso, that a clandestine trade would be carried on, and then the\r\nsufferings of the Africans, crammed up in small vessels, which would be\r\nobliged to be hovering about from day to day, to watch an opportunity of\r\nlanding, would be ten times greater than any which they now experienced\r\nin the legal trade. He was glad, however, as the matter was to be\r\ndiscussed, that it had been brought forward in the shape of distinct\r\npropositions, to be grounded upon the evidence in the privy council\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox observed that he did not like, where he agreed as to the\r\nsubstance of a measure, to differ with respect to the form of it. If,\r\nhowever, he differed in any thing in the present case, it was with a\r\nview rather to forward the business than to injure it, or to throw\r\nanything like an obstacle in its way. Nothing like either should come\r\nfrom him. What he thought was, that all the propositions were not\r\nnecessary to be voted previously to the ultimate decision, though some\r\nof them undoubtedly were. He considered them as of two classes: the one,\r\nalleging the grounds upon which it was proper to proceed to the\r\nabolition; such as that the trade was productive of inexpressible\r\nmisery, in various ways, to the innocent natives of Africa; that it was\r\nthe grave of our seamen, and so on; the other merely answering\r\nobjections which might be started, and where there might be a difference\r\nof opinion. He was, however, glad that the propositions were likely to\r\nbe entered upon the journals; since, if, from any misfortune, the\r\nbusiness should be deferred, it might succeed another year. Sure he was\r\nthat it could not fail to succeed sooner or later. He highly approved of\r\nwhat Mr. Pitt had said relative to the language it became us to hold out\r\nto foreign powers, in case of a clandestine trade. With respect,\r\nhowever, to the assertion of Sir William Yonge that a clandestine trade\r\nin slaves would be worse than a legal one, he could not admit it. Such a\r\ntrade, if it existed at all, ought only to be clandestine. A trade in\r\nhuman flesh and sinews was so scandalous, that it ought not openly to be\r\ncarried on by any government whatever, and much less by that of a\r\nChristian country. With regard to the regulation of the Slave Trade, he\r\nknew of no such thing as a regulation of robbery and murder. There was\r\nno medium. The legislature must either abolish it, or plead guilty of\r\nall the wickedness which had been shown to attend it. He would now say a\r\nword or two with respect to the conduct of foreign nations on this\r\nsubject. It was possible that these, when they heard that the matter had\r\nbeen discussed in that House, might follow the example, or they might go\r\nbefore us and set one themselves. If this were to happen, though we\r\nmight be the losers, humanity would be the gainer. He himself had been\r\nthought sometimes to use expressions relative to France, which were too\r\nharsh, and as if he could only treat her as the enemy of this country.\r\nPolitically speaking, France was our rival. But he well knew the\r\ndistinction between political enmity and illiberal prejudice. If there\r\nwas any great and enlightened nation in Europe, it was France, which was\r\nas likely as any country upon the face of the globe to catch a spark\r\nfrom the light of our fire, and to act upon the present subject with\r\nwarmth and enthusiasm. France had often been improperly stimulated by\r\nher ambition; and he had no doubt but that, in the present instance, she\r\nwould readily follow its honourable dictates.\r\n\r\nMr. (afterwards Lord) Grenville would not detain the house by going into\r\na question which had been so ably argued; but he should not do justice\r\nto his feelings, if he did not express publicly to his honourable\r\nfriend, Mr. Wilberforce, the pleasure he had received from one of the\r\nmost masterly and eloquent speeches he had ever heard; a speech which,\r\nwhile it did honour to him, entitled him to the thanks of the House, of\r\nthe people of England, of all Europe, and of the latest posterity. He\r\napproved of the propositions as the best mode of bringing this great\r\nquestion to a happy issue. He was pleased, also, with the language which\r\nhad been held out with respect to foreign nations, and with our\r\ndetermination to assert our right of preventing our colonies from\r\ncarrying on any trade which we had thought it our duty to abandon.\r\n\r\nAldermen Newnham, Sawbridge, and Watson, though they wished well to the\r\ncause of humanity, could not, as representatives of the city of London,\r\ngive their concurrence to a measure which would injure it so essentially\r\nas the abolition of the Slave Trade. This trade might undoubtedly be put\r\nunder wholesome regulations, and made productive of great commercial\r\nadvantages; but, if it were abolished, it would render the city of\r\nLondon one scene of bankruptcy and ruin. It became the house to take\r\ncare, while they were giving way to the goodness of their hearts, that\r\nthey did not contribute to the ruin of the mercantile interests of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin stated that he was so well satisfied with the speech of the\r\nhonourable gentleman who had introduced the propositions, and with the\r\nlanguage held out by other distinguished members on this subject, that\r\nhe felt himself more proud than ever of being an Englishman. He hoped\r\nand believed that the melancholy predictions of the worthy aldermen\r\nwould not prove true, and that the citizens of London would have too\r\nmuch public spirit to wish that a great national object (which\r\ncomprehended the great duties of humanity and justice) should be set\r\naside, merely out of consideration to their own private interests.\r\n\r\nMr. Dempster expected, notwithstanding all he had heard, that the first\r\nproposition submitted to them would have been to make good out of the\r\npublic purse all the losses individuals were liable to sustain from an\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade. This ought to have been, as Lord Penrhyn\r\nhad observed, a preliminary measure. He did not like to be generous out\r\nof the pockets of others. They were to abolish the trade, it was said,\r\nout of a principle of humanity. Undoubtedly they owed humanity to all\r\nmankind; but they also owed justice to those who were interested in the\r\nevent of the question, and had embarked their fortunes on the faith of\r\nparliament. In fact he did not like to see men introducing even their\r\nschemes of benevolence to the detriment of other people; and much less\r\ndid he like to see them going to the colonies, as it were upon their\r\nestates, and prescribing rules to them for their management. With\r\nrespect to his own speculative opinion, as it regarded cultivation, he\r\nhad no objection to give it. He was sure that sugar could be raised\r\ncheaper by free-men than by slaves. This the practice in China\r\nabundantly proved; but yet neither he, nor any other person, had a right\r\nto force a system upon others. As to the trade itself, by which the\r\npresent labourers were supplied, it had been considered by that House as\r\nso valuable that they had preferred it to all others, and had annually\r\nvoted a considerable sum towards carrying it on. They had hitherto\r\ndeemed it an essential nursery for our seamen. Had it really been such\r\nas had been represented, our ancestors would scarcely have encouraged\r\nit; and therefore, upon these and other considerations, he could not\r\nhelp thinking that they would be wanting in their duty if they abolished\r\nit altogether.\r\n\r\nMr. William Smith would not detain the House long at that late hour upon\r\nthis important subject; but he could not help testifying the great\r\nsatisfaction he felt at the manner, in which the honourable gentleman\r\nwho opened the debate (if it could be so called) had treated it. He\r\napproved of the propositions as the best mode of bringing the decision\r\nto a happy issue. He gave Mr. Fox great credit for the open and manly\r\nway in which he had manifested his abhorrence of this trade, and for the\r\nsupport he meant to give to the total and unqualified abolition of it;\r\nfor he was satisfied, that the more it was inquired into, the more it\r\nwould be found that nothing short of abolition would cure the evil. With\r\nrespect to certain assertions of the members for Liverpool, and certain\r\nmelancholy predictions about the consequences of such an event, which\r\nothers had held out, he desired to lay in his claim for observation upon\r\nthem when the great question should come before the House.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the House broke up; and the discussion of the\r\npropositions, which was the next parliamentary measure intended, was\r\npostponed to a future day, which was sufficiently distant to give all\r\nthe parties concerned, time to make the necessary preparations for it.\r\n\r\nOf this interval the committee for the abolition availed themselves, to\r\nthank Mr. Wilberforce for the very able and satisfactory manner in which\r\nhe had stated to the House his propositions for the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade, and for the unparalleled assiduity and perseverance with\r\nwhich he had all along endeavoured to accomplish this object, as well as\r\nto take measures themselves for the further promotion of it. Their\r\nopponents availed themselves of this interval also. But that which now\r\nembarrassed them, was the evidence contained in the privy council\r\nreport. They had no idea, considering the number of witnesses they had\r\nsent to be examined, that this evidence, when duly weighed, could by\r\nright reasoning have given birth to the sentiments which had been\r\ndisplayed in the speeches of the most distinguished members of the House\r\nof Commons, or to the contents of the propositions which had been laid\r\nupon their table. They were thunderstruck as it were by their own\r\nweakness; and from this time they were determined, if possible, to get\r\nrid of it as a standard for decision, or to interpose, every\r\nparliamentary delay in their power.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May, the subject came again before the attention of the\r\nHouse. It was ushered in, as was expected, by petitions collected in the\r\ninterim, and which were expressive of the frightful consequences which\r\nwould attend the abolition of the Slave Trade. Alderman Newnham\r\npresented one from certain merchants in London; Alderman Watson another\r\nfrom certain merchants, mortgagees, and creditors of the sugar-islands;\r\nLord Maitland, another from the planters of Antigua; Mr. Blackburne,\r\nanother from certain manufacturers of Manchester; Mr. Gascoyne, another\r\nfrom the corporation of Liverpool; and Lord Penrhyn, others from\r\ndifferent interested bodies in the same town.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilberforce then moved the order of the day for the House to go into\r\na committee of the whole house on the report of the privy council, and\r\nthe several matters of evidence already upon the table relative to the\r\nSlave Trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Alderman Sawbridge immediately arose, and asked Mr. Wilberforce if\r\nhe meant to adduce any other evidence, besides that in the privy council\r\nreport, in behalf of his propositions, or to admit other witnesses, if\r\nsuch could be found, to invalidate them. Mr. Wilberforce replied, that\r\nhe was quite satisfied with the report on the table. It would establish\r\nall his propositions. He should call no witnesses himself; as to\r\npermission to others to call them, that must be determined by the House.\r\n\r\nThis question and this answer gave birth immediately to great disputes\r\nupon the subject. Aldermen Sawbridge, Newnham, and Watson; Lords Penrhyn\r\nand Maitland; Messrs. Gascoyne, Marsham, and others, spoke against the\r\nadmission of the evidence which had been laid upon the table. They\r\ncontended that it was insufficient, defective, and contradictory; that\r\nit was _ex parte_ evidence; that it had been manufactured by ministers;\r\nthat it was founded chiefly on hearsay, and that the greatest part of it\r\nwas false; that it had undergone no cross-examination; that it was\r\nunconstitutional; and that, if they admitted it, they would establish a\r\ndangerous precedent, and abandon their rights. It was urged on the other\r\nhand by Mr. Courtenay, that it could not be _ex parte_ evidence, because\r\nit contained testimony on both sides of the question. The circumstance,\r\nalso, of its being contradictory, which had been alleged against it,\r\nproved that it was the result of an impartial examination. Mr. Fox\r\nobserved, that it was perfectly admissible. He called upon those, who\r\ntook the other side of the question, to say why, if it was really\r\ninadmissible, they had not opposed it at first. It had now been a long\r\ntime on the table, and no fault had been found with it. The truth was,\r\nit did not suit them; and they were determined by a side-wind, as it\r\nwere, to put an end to the inquiry. Mr. Pitt observed, that, if\r\nparliament had previously resolved to receive no evidence on a given\r\nsubject but from the privy council, such a resolution, indeed, would\r\nstrike at the root of the privileges of the House of Commons; but it was\r\nabsurd to suppose that the House could upon no occasion receive\r\nevidence, taken where it was most convenient to take it, and subject\r\nthroughout to new investigation, if any one doubted its validity. The\r\nreport of the privy council consisted, first, of calculations and\r\naccounts from the public offices; and, next, of written documents on the\r\nsubject: both of which were just as authentic as if they had been laid\r\nupon the table of that House. The remaining part of it consisted of the\r\ntestimony of living witnesses, all of whose names were published; so\r\nthat if any one doubted their veracity, it was open to him to re-examine\r\nall or each of them. It had been said by adversaries that the report on\r\nthe table was a weak and imperfect report, but would not these have the\r\nadvantage of its weakness and imperfection? It was strange, when his\r\nhonourable friend, Mr. Wilberforce, had said, \"Weak and imperfect as the\r\nreport may be thought to be, I think it strong enough to bear me out in\r\nall my propositions,\" that they, who objected to it, should have no\r\nbetter reason to give than this, \"We object, because the ground of\r\nevidence on which you rest is too weak to support your cause.\" Unless it\r\nwere meant to say (and the meaning seemed to be but thinly disguised)\r\nthat the House ought to abandon the inquiry, he saw no reason whatever\r\nfor not going immediately into a committee; and he wished gentlemen to\r\nconsider whether it became the dignity of their proceedings to obstruct\r\nthe progress of an inquiry, which the House had pledged itself to\r\nundertake. Their conduct, indeed, seemed extraordinary on this occasion.\r\nIt was certainly singular that; while the report had been five weeks\r\nupon the table, no argument had been brought against its sufficiency;\r\nbut that on the moment when the House was expected to come to an\r\nultimate vote upon the subject, it should be thought defective,\r\ncontradictory, unconstitutional, and otherwise objectionable. These\r\nobjections, he was satisfied, neither did nor could originate with the\r\ncountry gentlemen; but they were brought forward; for purposes not now\r\nto be concealed, by the avowed enemies of this noble cause.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the discussion which arose upon this subject, every\r\nopportunity was taken to impress the House with the dreadful\r\nconsequences of the abolition! Mr. Heriniker read a long letter from the\r\nKing of Dahomey to George the First, which had been found among the\r\npapers of James, first Duke of Chandos, and which had remained in the\r\nfamily till that time. In this, the King of Dahomey boasted of his\r\nvictory over the King of Ardrah and how he had ornamented the pavement\r\nand walls of his palace with the heads of the vanquished. These\r\ncruelties, Mr. Henniker said, were not imputable to the Slave Trade.\r\nThey showed the Africans to be naturally a savage people, and that we\r\ndid them a great kindness by taking them from their country. Alderman\r\nSawbridge maintained that, if the abolition passed, the Africans who\r\ncould not be sold as slaves would be butchered at home; while those who\r\nhad been carried, to our islands would be no longer under control. Hence\r\ninsurrections, and the manifold evils which belonged to them. Alderman\r\nNewnham was certain that the abolition would be the ruin of the trade of\r\nthe country. It would affect even the landed interest and the funds. It\r\nwould be impossible to collect money to diminish the national debt.\r\nEvery man in the kingdom would feel the abolition come home to hit.\r\nAlderman Watson maintained the same argument, and pronounced the trade\r\nunder discussion to be a merciful and humane trade.\r\n\r\nCompensation was also insisted upon by Mr. Drake, Alderman Newnham, Mr.\r\nSenniker, Mr. Cruger, and others. This was resisted by Mr. Burke; who\r\nsaid, that compensation in such a case would be contrary to every\r\nprinciple of legislation. Government gave encouragement to any branch of\r\ncommerce while it was regarded as conducive to the welfare of the\r\ncommunity; or compatible with humanity and justice; but they were\r\ncompetent to withdraw their countenance from it, when it was found to be\r\nimmoral, and injurious, and disgraceful to the state: They who engaged\r\nin it knew the terms under which they were placed, and adopted it with\r\nall the risks with which it was accompanied; and of consequence it was\r\nbut just, that they should be prepared to abide by the loss which might\r\naccrue, when the public should think it right no longer to support it.\r\nBut such a trade as this it was impossible any longer to support. Indeed\r\nit was not a trade. It was a system of robbery. It was a system, too,\r\ninjurious to the welfare of other nations. How could Africa ever be\r\ncivilized under it? While we continued to purchase the natives, they\r\nmust remain in a state of barbarism. It was impossible to civilize\r\nslaves. It was contrary to the system of human nature. There was no\r\ncountry placed under such disadvantageous circumstances, into which the\r\nshadow of improvement had ever been introduced.\r\n\r\nGreat pains were taken to impress the house with the propriety of\r\nregulation. Sir Grey Cooper; Aldermen Sawbridge, Watson, and Newnham;\r\nMr. Marsham, and Mr. Cruger, contended strenuously for it instead of\r\nabolition. It was also stated, that the merchants would consent to any\r\nregulation of the trade which might be offered to them.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate much warmth of temper was manifested on both\r\nsides. The expression of Mr. Fox in a former debate, \"that the Slave\r\nTrade could not be regulated, because there could be no regulation of\r\nrobbery and murder,\" was brought up, and construed by planters in the\r\nhouse as a charge of these crimes upon themselves. Mr. Fox, however,\r\nwould not retract the expression. He repeated it. He had no notion,\r\nhowever, that any individual would have taken it to himself. If it\r\ncontained any reflection at all, it was on the whole parliament, who had\r\nsanctioned such a trade. Mr. Molyneux rose up, and animadverted severely\r\non the character of Mr. Ramsay, one of the evidences in the privy\r\ncouncil report, during his residence in the West Indies. This called up\r\nSir William Dolben and Sir Charles Middleton in his defence, the latter\r\nof whom bore honourable testimony to his virtues from an intimate\r\nacquaintance with him, and a residence in the same village with him, for\r\ntwenty years. Mr. Molyneux spoke also in angry terms of the measure of\r\nabolition. To annihilate the trade, he said, and to make no compensation\r\non account of it, was an act of swindling. Mr. Macnamara called the\r\nmeasure hypocritical, fanatic, and methodistical. Mr. Pitt was so\r\nirritated at the insidious attempt to set aside the privy council\r\nreport, when no complaint had been alleged against it before, that he\r\nwas quite off his guard, and he thought it right afterwards to apologize\r\nfor the warmth into which he had been betrayed. The Speaker, too, was\r\nobliged frequently to interfere. On this occasion no less than thirty\r\nmembers spoke. And there had probably been few seasons, when so much\r\ndisorder had been discoverable in that house.\r\n\r\nThe result of the debate was, a permission to those interested in the\r\ncontinuance of the Slave Trade to bring counsel to the bar on the 26th\r\nof May, and then to introduce such witnesses, as might throw further\r\nlight on the propositions in the shortest time: for Mr. Pitt only\r\nacquiesced in this new measure on a supposition, \"that there would be no\r\nunnecessary delay, as he could by no means submit to the ultimate\r\nprocrastination of so important a business.\" He even hoped (and in this\r\nhope he was joined by Mr. Fox) that those concerned would endeavour to\r\nbring the whole of the evidence they meant to offer at the first\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed, the house met for the purposes now specified; when\r\nAlderman Newnham, thinking that such an important question should not be\r\ndecided but in a full assembly of the representatives of the nation,\r\nmoved for a call of the House on that day fortnight. Mr. Wilberforce\r\nstated that he had no objection to such a measure; believing the greater\r\nthe number present the more favourable it would be to his cause. This\r\nmotion, however, produced a debate and a division, in which it appeared\r\nthat there were one hundred and fifty-eight in favour of it, and\r\ntwenty-eight against it. The business of the day now commenced. The\r\nhouse went into a committee, and Sir William Dolben was put into the\r\nchair. Mr. Serjeant Le Blanc was then called in. He made an able speech\r\nin behalf of his clients; and introduced John Barnes, Esquire, as his\r\nfirst witness, whose examination took up the remainder of the day. By\r\nthis step they who were interested in the continuance of the trade,\r\nattained their wishes, for they had now got possession of the ground\r\nwith their evidence; and they knew they could keep it, almost as long as\r\nthey pleased, for the purposes of delay. Thus they, who boasted, when\r\nthe privy council examinations began, that they would soon do away all\r\nthe idle tales which had been invented against them, and who desired the\r\npublic only to suspend their judgment till the report should come out,\r\nwhen they would see the folly and wickedness of all our allegations,\r\ndared not abide by the evidence which they themselves had taught others\r\nto look up to as the standard by which they were desirous of being\r\njudged: thus they, who had advantages beyond measure in forming a body\r\nof evidence in their own favour, abandoned that which they had\r\ncollected. And here it is impossible for me not to make a short\r\ncomparative statement on this subject, if it were only to show how\r\nlittle can be made out, with the very best opportunities, against the\r\ncause of humanity and religion. With respect to ourselves, we had almost\r\nall our witnesses to seek. We had to travel after them for weeks\r\ntogether. When we found them, we had scarcely the power of choice. We\r\nwhere obliged to take them as they came. When we found them, too, we had\r\ngenerally to implore them to come forward in our behalf. Of those so\r\nimplored, three out of four refused, and the plea for this refusal was a\r\nfear lest they should injure their own interests. The merchants, on the\r\nother hand, had their witnesses ready on the spot. They had always ships\r\nin harbour, containing persons who had a knowledge of the subject, they\r\nhad several also from whom to choose. If one man was favourable to their\r\ncause in three of the points belonging to it, but was unfavourable in\r\nthe fourth, he could be put aside and replaced. When they had thus\r\nselected them, they had not to entreat, but to command their attendance.\r\nThey had no fear, again, when they thus commanded, of a refusal on the\r\nground of interest; because these were promoting their interest by\r\nobliging these who employed them. Viewing these and other circumstances,\r\nwhich might be thrown into this comparative statement, it was some\r\nconsolation to us to know, amidst the disappointment which this new\r\nmeasure occasioned, and our apparent defeat in the eyes of the public,\r\nthat we had really beaten our opponents at their own weapons, and that,\r\nas this was a victory in our own private feelings, so it was the presage\r\nto us of a future triumph.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of May, Mr. Tierney made a motion to divide the\r\nconsideration of the Slave Trade into two heads, by separating the\r\nAfrican from the West Indian part of the question. This he did for the\r\nmore clear discussion of the propositions, as well as to save time. This\r\nmotion, however, was overruled by Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 9th of June, by which time it was supposed that new\r\nlight, and this in sufficient quantity, would have been thrown upon the\r\npropositions, it appeared that only two witnesses had been fully heard.\r\nThe examinations, therefore, were continued, and they went on till the\r\n23rd. On this day, the order for the call of the house, which had been\r\nprolonged, standing unrepealed, there was a large attendance of members.\r\nA motion was then made, to get rid of the business altogether, but it\r\nfailed. It was now seen, however, that it was impossible to bring the\r\nquestion to a final decision in this session; for they who were\r\ninterested in it, affirmed that they had yet many important witnesses to\r\nintroduce. Alderman Newnham, therefore, by the consent of Mr.\r\nWilberforce, moved that \"the further consideration of the subject be\r\ndeferred to the next session.\" On this occasion, Mr. William Smith\r\nremarked, that though the decision on the great question was thus to be\r\nadjourned, he hoped the examinations at least would be permitted to go\r\non. He had not heard any good reason why they might not be carried on\r\nfor some weeks  longer. It was known that the hearing of evidence was,\r\nat all times thinly attended. If, therefore, the few members who did\r\nattend, were willing to give up their time a little longer, why should\r\nother members complain of an inconvenience in the suffering of which\r\nthey took no share? He thought that by this the examination of witnesses\r\non the part of the merchants might be finished, and of consequence the\r\nbusiness brought into a very desirable state of forwardness against the\r\nensuing session. These observations had not the desired effect, and the\r\nmotion of Mr. Alderman Newnham was carried without a division. Thus the\r\ngreat question, for the elucidation of which all the new evidences were\r\nto be heard at the very first examination, in order that it might be\r\ndecided by the 9th of June, was, by the intrigue of our opponents,\r\ndeferred to another year.\r\n\r\nThe order of the day for going into the further consideration of the\r\nSlave Trade having been discharged, Sir William Dolben rose to state,\r\nthat it was his intention to renew his bill of the former year, relative\r\nto the conveyance of the unhappy Africans from their own country to the\r\nWest Indies, and to propose certain alterations in it. He made a motion\r\naccordingly, which was adopted; and he and Mr. Wilberforce were desired\r\nto prepare the same.\r\n\r\nThis bill he introduced soon afterwards, and it passed; but not without\r\nopposition. It was a matter, however, of great pleasure to find that the\r\nworthy baronet was enabled by the assistance of Captain (afterwards\r\nAdmiral) Macbride, and other naval officers in the house, to carry such\r\nclauses, as provided in some degree for the comfort of the poor seamen\r\nwho were seduced into this wicked trade. They could not, indeed, provide\r\nagainst the barbarity of their captains; but they secured them a space\r\nunder the half deck in which to sleep. They prescribed a form of\r\nmuster-rolls, which they were to see and sign in the presence of the\r\nclearing officer. They regulated their food, both as to kind and\r\nquantity; and they preserved them from many of the impositions to which\r\nthey had been before exposed.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when Mr. Wilberforce gave his first notice this session to\r\nthe present, I had been variously employed, but more particularly in the\r\ncomposition of a new work. It was soon perceived to be the object of our\r\nopponents, to impress upon the public the preference, of regulation to\r\nabolition. I attempted, therefore, to show the fallacy and wickedness of\r\nthis notion. I divided the evils belonging to the Slave Trade into two\r\nkinds. These I enumerated in their order. With respect to those of the\r\nfirst kind, I proved that they were never to be remedied by any acts of\r\nthe British parliament. Thus, for instance, what bill could alter the\r\nnature of the human passions? What bill could prevent fraud and violence\r\nin Africa, while the Slave Trade existed there? What bill could prevent\r\nthe miserable victims of the trade from rising, when on board the ships,\r\nif they saw an opportunity, and felt a keen sense of their oppression?\r\nThose of the second I stated to admit of a remedy, and after making\r\naccurate calculations on the subject of each, I showed that those\r\nmerchants who were to do them away effectually, would be ruined by their\r\nvoyages. The work was called _An Essay on the Comparative Efficiency of\r\nRegulation or Abolition as applied to the Slave Trade_.\r\n\r\nThe committee, also, in this interval, brought out their famous print of\r\nthe plan and section of a slave-ship, which was designed to give the\r\nspectator an idea of the sufferings of the Africans in the Middle\r\nPassage, and this so familiarly, that he might instantly pronounce upon\r\nthe miseries experienced there. The committee at Plymouth had been the\r\nfirst to suggest the idea; but that in London had now improved it. As\r\nthis print seemed to make an instantaneous impression of horror upon all\r\nwho saw it, and as it was therefore very instrumental, in consequence of\r\nthe wide circulation given it, in serving the cause of the injured\r\nAfricans, I have given the reader a copy of it in the annexed plate, and\r\nI will now state the ground or basis upon which it was formed.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious that it became the committee to select some one ship,\r\nwhich had been engaged in the Slave Trade, with her real dimensions, if\r\nthey meant to make a fair representation of the manner of the\r\ntransportation. When Captain Parrey, of the royal navy, returned from\r\nLiverpool, to which place Government had sent him, he brought with him\r\nthe admeasurement of several vessels which had been so employed, and\r\nlaid them on the table of the House of Commons. At the top of his list\r\nstood the ship Brookes. The committee, therefore, in choosing a vessel\r\non this occasion, made use of the ship Brookes; and this they did,\r\nbecause they thought it less objectionable to take the first that came,\r\nthan any other. The vessel, then, in the plate is the vessel now\r\nmentioned, and the following is her admeasurement as given in by Captain\r\nParrey.\r\n\r\n                                                                    Ft.

They allowed, accordingly, to\r\nevery man slave 6 ft. by 1 ft. 4in. for room, to every woman 5 ft. by 1\r\nft. 4 in., to every boy 5 ft. by 1 ft. 2 in., and to every girl 4 ft. 6\r\nin. by 1 ft. They then stowed them, and found them as in the annexed\r\nplate, that is, they found, (deducting the women stowed in z of figures\r\n6 and 7, which spaces, being half of the half-deck, were allowed by Sir\r\nWilliam Dolben's last bill to the seamen,) that only 450 could be stowed\r\nin her; and the reader will find, if he should think it worthwhile to\r\ncount the figures in the plate, that, on making the deduction mentioned,\r\nthey will amount to this number.\r\n\r\nThe committee then thought it right to inquire how many slaves the act\r\nof Sir William Dolben allowed this vessel to carry, and they found the\r\nnumber to be 454; that is, they found it allowed her to carry four more\r\nthan could be put in without trespassing upon the room allotted to the\r\nrest; for we see that the bodies of the slaves, except just at the head\r\nof the vessel, already touch each other, and that no deduction has been\r\nmade for tubs or stanchions to support the platforms and decks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Slave Ship]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Slave Ship]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Slave Ship]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Slave Ship]\r\n\r\nSuch was the picture which the committee were obliged to draw, if they\r\nregarded mathematical accuracy, of the room allotted to the slaves in\r\nthis vessel. By this picture was exhibited the nature of the Elysium\r\nwhich Mr. Norris and others had invented for them during their\r\ntransportation from their own country. By this picture were seen also\r\nthe advantages of Sir William Dolben's bill; for many, on looking at the\r\nplate, considered the regulation itself as perfect barbarism. The\r\nadvantages, however, obtained by it were considerable; for the Brookes\r\nwas now restricted to 450 slaves, whereas it was proved that she carried\r\n609 in a former voyage.\r\n\r\nThe committee, at the conclusion of the session of parliament, made a\r\nsuitable report. It will be unnecessary to detail this, for obvious\r\nreasons. There was, however, one thing contained in it, which ought\r\nnot to be omitted. It stated, with appropriate concern, the death of\r\nthe first controversial writer, and of one of the most able and\r\nindefatigable labourers in their cause. Mr. Ramsay had been for some\r\ntime indisposed. The climate of the West Indies, during a residence of\r\ntwenty years, and the agitation in which his mind had been kept for\r\nthe last four years of his life, in consequence of the virulent\r\nattacks on his word and character by those interested in the\r\ncontinuance of the trade, had contributed to undermine his\r\nconstitution. During his whole illness he was cheerful and composed;\r\nnor did he allow it to hinder him, severe as it was, from taking any\r\nopportunity which offered, of serving those unhappy persons for whose\r\ninjuries he had so deeply felt. A few days only before he died, I\r\nreceived from him probably the last letter he ever wrote, of which the\r\nfollowing is an extract:\r\n\r\n    \"My health has certainly taken a most alarming turn; and, if\r\n    some considerable alteration does not take place for the\r\n    better in a very little time, it will be all over with me: I\r\n    mean as to the present life. I have lost all appetite, and\r\n    suffer grievously from an almost continual pain in my\r\n    stomach, which leaves me no enjoyment of myself, but such as\r\n    I can collect from my own reflections, and the comforts of\r\n    religion. I am glad the bill for the abolition is in such\r\n    forwardness. Whether it goes through the house or not, the\r\n    discussion attending it will have a most beneficial effect.\r\n    The whole of this business I think now to be in such a train,\r\n    as to enable me to bid farewell to the present scene with the\r\n    satisfaction of not having lived in vain, and of having done\r\n    something towards the improvement of our common nature; and\r\n    this at no little expense of time and reputation. The little\r\n    I have now written is my utmost effort; yet yesterday I\r\n    thought it necessary to write an answer to a scurrilous libel\r\n    in _The Diary_ by one Scipio. On my own account he should\r\n    have remained unnoticed; but our great cause must be kept\r\n    unsullied.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ramsay was a man of active habit, of diligence and perseverance in\r\nhis undertakings, and of extraordinary application. He was of mild and\r\nhumble manners. He possessed a strong understanding, with great\r\ncoolness and courage. Patriotism and public spirit were striking\r\ntraits in his character. In domestic life he was amiable: in the\r\nministry, exemplary and useful; and he died to the great regret of his\r\nparishioners; but most of all to that of those who moved with him in\r\nhis attempts to bring about the important event of the abolition of\r\nthe Slave Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nContinuation from July 1789 to July 1790.--Author travels to Paris to\r\npromote the abolition in France; attends the committees of the Friends\r\nof the Negroes.--Counter-attempts of the committee of White\r\nColonists.--An account of the deputies of Colour.--Meeting at the Duke\r\nde la Rochefoucauld's.--Mirabeau espouses the cause; canvasses the\r\nNational Assembly.--Distribution of the section of the slave-ship\r\nthere.--Character of Brissot.--Author leaves Paris and returns to\r\nEngland.--Examination of merchants' and planters' evidence resumed in\r\nthe House of Commons.--Author travels in search of evidence in favour\r\nof the abolition; opposition to the hearing of it.--This evidence is\r\nat length introduced.--Renewal of Sir William Dolben's\r\nbill.--Distribution of the section of the slave-ship in England; and\r\nof Cowper's Negro's Complaint; and of Wedgewood's Cameos.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe usually find, as we give ourselves up to reflection, some little\r\nmitigation of the afflictions we experience; and yet of the evils\r\nwhich come upon us, some are often so heavy as to overpower the\r\nsources of consolation for a time, and to leave us wretched. This was\r\nnearly our situation at the close of the last session of parliament.\r\nIt would be idle not to confess that circumstances had occurred which\r\nwounded us deeply. Though we had foiled our opponents at their own\r\nweapons, and had experienced the uninterrupted good wishes and support\r\nof the public, we had the great mortification to see the enthusiasm of\r\nmembers of parliament beginning to cool; to see a question of humanity\r\nand justice (for such it was when it was delivered into their hands)\r\nverging towards that of commercial calculation; and finally to see\r\nregulation, as it related to it, in the way of being substituted for\r\nabolition; but most of all were we affected, knowing as we did the\r\nnature and the extent of the sufferings belonging to the Slave Trade,\r\nthat these should be continued to another year. This last\r\nconsideration almost overpowered me. It had fallen to my lot, more\r\nthan to that of any other person, to know these evils, and I seemed\r\nalmost inconsolable at the postponement of the question. I wondered\r\nhow members of parliament, and these Englishmen, could talk as they\r\ndid on this subject; how they could bear for a moment to consider\r\ntheir fellow-man as an article of trade; and how they should not count\r\neven the delay of an hour, which occasioned so much misery to\r\ncontinue, as one of the most criminal actions of their lives.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain, however, to sink under our burdens. Grief could do no\r\ngood; and if our affairs had taken an unfavourable turn, the question\r\nwas, how to restore them. It was sufficiently obvious that, if our\r\nopponents were left to themselves, or without any counteracting\r\nevidence, they would considerably soften down the propositions, if not\r\ninvalidate them in the minds of many. They had such a power of selection\r\nof witnesses, that they could bring men forward who might say with truth\r\nthat they had seen but very few of the evils complained of, and these in\r\nan inferior degree. We knew, also, from the example of the Liverpool\r\ndelegates, how interest and prejudice could blind the eyes, and how\r\nothers might be called upon to give their testimony, who would dwell\r\nupon the comforts of the Africans when they came into our power; on the\r\nsprinkling of their apartments with frankincense; on the promotion of\r\nmusic and the dance among them; and on the health and festivity of their\r\nvoyages. It seemed, therefore, necessary that we should again be looking\r\nout for evidence on the part of the abolition. Nor did it seem to me to\r\nbe unreasonable, if our opponents were allowed to come forward in a new\r\nway, because it was more constitutional, that we should be allowed the\r\nsame privilege. By these means the evidence, of which we had now lost\r\nthe use, might be restored; indifference might be fanned into warmth;\r\ncommercial calculation might be overpowered by justice; and abolition,\r\nrising above the reach of the cry of regulation, might eventually\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nI communicated my ideas to the committee, and offered to go round the\r\nkingdom to accomplish this object. The committee had themselves been\r\nconsidering what measures to take, and as each in his own mind had come\r\nto conclusions similar with my own, my proposal was no sooner made than\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nI had not been long upon this journey when I was called back. Mr.\r\nWilberforce, always solicitous for the good of this great cause, was of\r\nopinion that, as commotions had taken place in France, which then aimed\r\nat political reforms, it was possible that the leading persons concerned\r\nin them might, if an application were made to them judiciously, be\r\ninduced to take the Slave Trade into their consideration, and\r\nincorporate it among the abuses to be done away. Such a measure, if\r\nrealized, would not only lessen the quantity of human suffering, but\r\nannihilate a powerful political argument against us. He had a\r\nconference, therefore, with the committee on this subject; and, as they\r\naccorded with his opinion, they united with him in writing a letter to\r\nme, to know if I would change my journey, and proceed to France.\r\n\r\nAs I had no object in view but the good of the cause, it was immaterial\r\nto me where I went, if I could but serve it; and therefore, without any\r\nfurther delay, I returned to London.\r\n\r\nAs accounts had arrived in England of the excesses which had taken place\r\nin the city of Paris, and of the agitated state of the provinces through\r\nwhich I was to pass, I was desired by several of my friends to change my\r\nname. To this I could not consent; and, on consulting the committee,\r\nthey were decidedly against it.\r\n\r\nI was introduced as quickly as possible, on my arrival at Paris, to the\r\nfriends of the cause there, to the Duke de la Rochefoucauld, the Marquis\r\nde Condorcet, Messieurs Pétion de Villeneuve, Clavière, and Brissot, and\r\nto the Marquis de la Fayette. The latter received me with peculiar marks\r\nof attention. He had long felt for the wrongs of Africa, and had done\r\nmuch to prevent them. He had a plantation in Cayenne, and had devised a\r\nplan, by which the labourers upon it should pass by degrees from slavery\r\nto freedom! With this view he had there laid it down as a principle,\r\nthat all crimes were equal, whether they were committed by Blacks or\r\nWhites, and ought equally to be punished. As the human mind is of such a\r\nnature, as to be acted upon by rewards as well as punishments, he\r\nthought it unreasonable, that the slaves should have no advantage from a\r\nstimulus from the former. He laid it down therefore as another\r\nprinciple, that temporal profits should follow virtuous action. To this\r\nhe subjoined a reasonable education to be gradually given. By\r\nintroducing such principles, and by making various regulations for the\r\nprotection and comforts of the slaves, he thought he could prove to the\r\nplanters, that there was no necessity for the Slave Trade; that the\r\nslaves upon all their estates would increase sufficiently by population;\r\nthat they might be introduced gradually, and without detriment, to a\r\nstate of freedom; and that then the real interests of all would be most\r\npromoted. This system he had began to act upon two years before I saw\r\nhim. He had also, when the society was established in Paris, which took\r\nthe name of \"The Friends of the Negroes,\" enrolled himself a member of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe first public steps taken after my arrival in Paris were at a\r\ncommittee of the Friends of the Negroes, which was but thinly attended.\r\nNone of those mentioned, except Brissot, were present. It was resolved\r\nthere, that the committee should solicit an audience of Mr. Necker; and\r\nthat I should wait upon him, accompanied by a deputation consisting of\r\nthe Marquis de Condorcet, Monsieur de Bourge, and Brissot de Warville:\r\nsecondly, that the committee should write to the president of the\r\nNational Assembly, and request the favour of him to appoint a day for\r\nhearing the cause of the Negroes; and thirdly, that it should be\r\nrecommended to the committee in London to draw up a petition to the\r\nNational Assembly of France, praying for the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade by that country. This petition, it was observed, was to be signed\r\nby as great a number of the friends to the cause in England, as could be\r\nprocured. It was then to be sent to the committee at Paris, who would\r\ntake it in a body to the place of its destination.\r\n\r\nI found great delicacy as a stranger in making my observations upon\r\nthese resolutions, and yet I thought I ought not to pass them over\r\nwholly in silence, but particularly the last. I therefore rose up, and\r\nstated that there was one resolution, of which I did not quite see the\r\npropriety; but this might arise from my ignorance of the customs, as\r\nwell as of the genius and spirit of the French people. It struck me that\r\nan application from a little committee in England to the National\r\nAssembly of France was not a dignified measure, nor was it likely to\r\nhave weight with such a body. It was, besides, contrary to all the\r\nhabits of propriety in which I had been educated. The British Parliament\r\ndid not usually receive petitions from the subjects of other nations. It\r\nwas this feeling which had induced me thus to speak.\r\n\r\nTo these observations it was replied, that the National Assembly of\r\nFrance would glory in going contrary to the example of other nations in\r\na case of generosity and justice, and that the petition in question, if\r\nit could be obtained, would have an influence there, which the people of\r\nEngland, unacquainted with the sentiments of the French nation, would\r\nhardly credit.\r\n\r\nTo this I had only to reply, that I would communicate the measure to the\r\ncommittee in London, but that I could not be answerable for the part\r\nthey would take in it.\r\n\r\nBy an answer received from Mr. Necker, relative to the first of these\r\nresolutions, it appeared that the desired interview had been obtained;\r\nbut he granted it only for a few minutes, and this principally to show\r\nhis good-will to the cause: for he was then so oppressed with business\r\nin his own department, that he had but little time for any other. He\r\nwrote to me, however, the next day, and desired my company to dinner. He\r\nthen expressed a wish to me, that any business relative to the Slave\r\nTrade might be managed by ourselves as individuals, and that I would\r\ntake the opportunity of dining with him occasionally for this purpose.\r\nBy this plan, he said, both of us would save time. Madame Necker, also,\r\npromised to represent her husband, if I should call in his absence, and\r\nto receive me, and converse with me on all occasions in which this great\r\ncause of humanity and religion might be concerned.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the other resolutions, nothing ever came of them; for we\r\nwaited daily for an answer from the president during the whole of his\r\npresidency, but we never received any; and the committee in London, when\r\nthey had read my letter, desired me unequivocally to say, that they did\r\nnot see the propriety of the petition which it had been recommended to\r\nthem to obtain.\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting it was resolved, that a letter should be written to\r\nthe new president for the same purpose as the former. This, it was said,\r\nwas now rendered essentially necessary; for the merchants, planters, and\r\nothers interested in the continuance of the Slave Trade, were so alarmed\r\nat the enthusiasm of the French people in favour of the new order of\r\nthings, and of any change recommended to them, which had the appearance\r\nof prompting the cause of liberty, that they held daily committees to\r\nwatch and to thwart the motions of the friends of the Negroes. It was\r\ntherefore thought proper, that the appeal to the Assembly should be\r\nimmediate on this subject, before the feelings of the people should\r\ncool, or before they, who were thus interested, should poison the minds\r\nby calculations of loss and gain. The silence of the former president\r\nwas already attributed to the intrigues of the planters' committee. No\r\ntime therefore was to be lost. The letter was accordingly written, but\r\nas no answer was ever returned to it, they attributed this second\r\nomission to the same cause.\r\n\r\nI do not really know whether interested persons ever did, as was\r\nsuspected, intercept the letters of the committee to the two presidents\r\nas now surmised; or whether they ever dissuaded them from introducing so\r\nimportant a question for discussion, when the nation was in such a\r\nheated state; but certain it is, that we had many, and I believe\r\nbarbarous, enemies to encounter. At the very next meeting of the\r\ncommittee, Clavière produced anonymous letters which he had received,\r\nand in which it was stated that, if the society of the Friends of the\r\nNegroes did not dissolve itself, he and the rest of them would be\r\nstabbed. It was said that no less than three hundred persons had\r\nassociated themselves for this purpose. I had received similar letters\r\nmyself; and on producing mine, and comparing the handwriting in both it\r\nappeared that the same persons had written.\r\n\r\nIn a few days after this, the public prints were filled with the most\r\nmalicious representations of the views of the committee. One of them\r\nwas, that they were going to send twelve thousand muskets to the Negroes\r\nin St. Domingo, in order to promote an insurrection there. This\r\ndeclaration was so industriously circulated, that a guard of soldiers\r\nwas sent to search the committee-room; but these were soon satisfied\r\nwhen they found only two or three books and some waste paper. Reports\r\nequally unfounded and wicked were spread also in the same papers\r\nrelative to myself. My name was mentioned at full length, and the place\r\nof my abode hinted at. It was stated at one time, that I had proposed\r\nsuch wild and mischievous plans to the committee in London relative to\r\nthe abolition of the Slave Trade, that they had cast me out of their own\r\nbody, and that I had taken refuge in Paris, where I now tried to impose\r\nequally on the French nation. It was stated at another, that I was\r\nemployed by the British government as a spy, and that it was my object\r\nto try to undermine the noble constitution which was then forming for\r\nFrance. This latter report, at this particular time, when the passions\r\nof men were so inflamed, and when the stones of Paris had not been long\r\npurified from the blood of Foulon and Berthier, might have cost me my\r\nlife; and I mentioned it to General la Fayette, and solicited his\r\nadvice. He desired me to make a public reply to it: which I did. He\r\ndesired me also to change my lodging to the Hotel de Yorck, that I might\r\nbe nearer to him; and to send to him if there should be any appearance\r\nof a collection of people about the hotel, and I should have aid from\r\nthe military in his quarter. He said, also, that he would immediately\r\ngive in my name to the Municipality; and that he would pledge himself to\r\nthem, that my views were strictly honourable.\r\n\r\nOn dining one day at the house of the Marquis de la Fayette, I met the\r\ndeputies of colour. They had arrived only the preceding day from St.\r\nDomingo, I was desired to take my seat at dinner in the midst of them.\r\nThey were six in number; of a sallow or swarthy complexion, but yet it\r\nwas not darker than that of some of the natives of the south of France.\r\nThey were already in the uniform of the Parisian National Guards; and\r\none of them wore the cross of St. Louis. They were men of genteel\r\nappearance and modest behaviour. They seemed to be well informed, and of\r\na more solid cast than those whom I was in the habit of seeing daily in\r\nthis city. The account which they gave of themselves was this. The white\r\npeople of St. Domingo consisting of less than ten thousand persons, had\r\ndeputies then sitting in the National Assembly. The people of colour in\r\nthe same island greatly exceeded the whites in number. They amounted to\r\nthirty thousand, and were generally proprietors of lands. They were\r\nequally free by law with the former, and paid their taxes to the\r\nmother-country in an equal proportion. But in consequence of having\r\nsprung from slaves they had no legislative power, and moreover were\r\ntreated with great contempt. Believing that the mother-country was going\r\nto make a change in its political constitution, they had called a\r\nmeeting on the island, and this meeting had deputed them to repair to\r\nFrance, and to desire the full rights of citizens, or that the free\r\npeople of colour might be put upon an equality with the whites. They\r\n(the deputies) had come in consequence. They had brought with them a\r\npresent of six millions of livres to the National Assembly, and an\r\nappointment to General la Fayette to be commander-in-chief over their\r\nconstituents, as a distinct body. This command, they said, the general\r\nhad accepted, though he had declined similar honours from every town in\r\nFrance, except Paris, in order to show that he patronized their cause.\r\n\r\nI was now very anxious to know the sentiments which these gentlemen\r\nentertained on the subject of the Slave Trade. If they were with us,\r\nthey might be very useful to us; not only by their votes in the\r\nAssembly, but by the knowledge of facts which they would be able to\r\nadduce there in our favour. If they were against us, it became me to be\r\nupon my guard against them, and to take measures accordingly. I\r\ntherefore stated to them at once the nature of my errand to France, and\r\ndesired their opinion upon it. This they gave me without reserve. They\r\nbroke out into lavish commendations of my conduct, and called me their\r\nfriend. The Slave Trade, they said, was the parent of all the miseries\r\nin St. Domingo, not only on account of the cruel treatment it occasioned\r\nto the slaves, but on account of the discord which it constantly kept up\r\nbetween the whites and people of colour, in consequence of the hateful\r\ndistinctions it introduced. These distinctions could never be\r\nobliterated while it lasted. Indeed both the trade and the slavery must\r\nfall, before the infamy, now fixed upon a skin of colour, could be so\r\ndone away, that whites and blacks could meet cordially, and look with\r\nrespect upon one another. They had it in their instructions, in case\r\nthey should obtain a seat in the Assembly, to propose, an immediate\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade, and an immediate amelioration of the state\r\nof slavery also, with a view to its final abolition in fifteen years.\r\n\r\nBut time was flying apace; I had now been nearly seven weeks in Paris,\r\nand had done nothing. The thought of this made me uneasy, and I saw no\r\nconsoling prospect before me. I found it even difficult to obtain a\r\nmeeting of the Friends of the Negroes. The Marquis de la Fayette had no\r\ntime to attend. Those of the committee, who were members of the National\r\nAssembly, were almost constantly engaged at Versailles. Such of them as\r\nbelonged to the Municipality, had enough to do at the Hotel deVille.\r\nOthers were employed either in learning the use of arms, or in keeping\r\ntheir daily and nightly guards. These circumstances made me almost\r\ndespair of doing anything for the cause at Paris, at least in any\r\nreasonable time. But a new circumstance occurred, which distressed me\r\ngreatly; for I discovered, in the most satisfactory manner, that two out\r\nof the six at the last committee were spies. They had come into the\r\nsociety for no other reason than to watch and report its motions; and\r\nthey were in direct correspondence with the slave-merchants at Havre de\r\nGrace. This matter I brought home to them afterwards, and I had the\r\npleasure of seeing them excluded from all our future meetings.\r\n\r\nFrom this time I thought it expedient to depend less upon the committee,\r\nand more upon my own exertions; and I formed the resolution of going\r\namong the members of the National Assembly myself, and of learning from\r\ntheir own mouths the hope I ought to entertain relative to the decision\r\nof our question. In the course of my endeavours I obtained a promise\r\nfrom the Duke de la Rochefoucauld, the Comte de Mirabeau the Abbé\r\nSiéyes, Monsieur Bergasse, and Monsieur Pétion de Villeneuvé, five of\r\nthe most approved members of the National Assembly, that they would meet\r\nme if I would fix a day. I obtained a similar promise from the Marquis\r\nde Condorcet, and Clavière and Brissot, as members selected from the\r\ncommittee of the Friends of the Negroes. And Messieurs de Roveray and Du\r\nMonde, two Genevese gentlemen at Versailles, men of considerable\r\nknowledge and interest, and who had heard of our intended meeting, were\r\nto join us at their own request. The place chosen was the house of the\r\nBishop of Chartres at Versailles.\r\n\r\nI was now in hope that I should soon bring the question to some issue;\r\nand on the 4th of October I went to dine with the Bishop of Chartres to\r\nfix the day. We appointed the 7th. But how soon, frequently, do our\r\nprospects fade! From the conversation which took place at dinner, I\r\nbegan to fear that our meeting would not be realised. About three days\r\nbefore, the officers of the Garde du Corps had given the memorable\r\nbanquet, recorded in the annals of the revolution, to the officers of\r\nthe regiment of Flanders, which then lay at Versailles. This was a topic\r\non which the company present dwelt. They condemned it as a most fatal\r\nmeasure in these heated times; and were apprehensive that something\r\nwould grow immediately out of it, which might endanger the king's\r\nsafety. In passing afterwards through the streets of Versailles my fears\r\nincreased. I met several of that regiment in groups. Some were\r\nbrandishing their swords. Others were walking arm in arm, and singing\r\ntumultuously. Others were standing and conversing earnestly together.\r\nAmong the latter I heard one declare with great vehemence, \"that it\r\nshould not be; that the revolution must go on.\" On my arrival at Paris\r\nin the evening, the Palais Royal was full of people; and there were\r\nmovements and buzzings among them, as if something was expected to\r\nhappen. The next day, when I went into the streets, it was obvious what\r\nwas going to take place. Suffice it to say, that the next evening the\r\nking and queen were brought prisoners into Paris. After this, things\r\nwere in such an unsettled state for a few days, and the members of the\r\nNational Assembly were so occupied in the consideration of the event\r\nitself, and of the consequences which might attend it, that my little\r\nmeeting, of which it had cost me so much time and trouble to procure the\r\nappointment, was entirely prevented.\r\n\r\nI had now to wait patiently till a new opportunity should occur. The\r\nComte de Mirabeau, before the departure of the king, had moved, and\r\ncarried the resolution, that \"the Assembly was inseparable from his\r\nmajesty's person.\" It was expected, therefore, that the National\r\nAssembly would immediately transfer its sittings to Paris. This took\r\nplace on the 19th. It was now more easy for me to bring persons\r\ntogether, than when I had to travel backward and forward to Versailles.\r\nAccordingly, by watching my opportunities, I obtained the promise of\r\nanother meeting. This was held afterwards at the Duke de la\r\nRochefoucauld's. The persons before mentioned were present; except the\r\nComte de Mirabeau, whose occupations at that moment made it utterly\r\nimpossible for him to attend.\r\n\r\nThe duke opened the business in an appropriate manner; and concluded, by\r\ndesiring each person to give his opinion frankly and unequivocally as to\r\nwhat might be expected of the National Assembly relative to the great\r\nmeasure of the abolition of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Siéyes rose up, and said it would probably bring the business\r\nwithin a shorter compass if, instead of discussing this proposition at\r\nlarge, I were to put to the meeting my own questions. I accordingly\r\naccepted this offer, and began by asking those present \"how long it was\r\nlikely that the present National Assembly would sit?\" After some\r\nconversation, it was replied that \"it would sit till it had completed\r\nthe constitution, and interwoven such fixed principles into it, that the\r\nlegislature which should succeed it might have nothing more to do than\r\nto proceed on the ordinary business of the state. Its dissolution would\r\nprobably not take place till the month of March.\"\r\n\r\nI then asked them, \"whether it was their opinion that the National\r\nAssembly would feel itself authorized to take up such a foreign question\r\n(if I might be allowed the expression) as that of the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade.\" The answer to this was, \"that the object of the National\r\nAssembly was undoubtedly the formation of a constitution for the French\r\npeople. With respect to foreign possessions, it was very doubtful\r\nwhether it were the real interest of France to have any colonies at all;\r\nbut while it kept such colonies under its dominion, the assembly would\r\nfeel that it had the right to take up this question; and that the\r\nquestion itself would naturally spring out of the bill of rights, which\r\nhad already been adopted as the basis of the constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe next question I proposed was, \"whether they were of opinion that the\r\nNational Assembly would do more wisely, in the present situation of\r\nthings, to determine upon the abolition of the Slave Trade now, or to\r\ntransfer it to the legislature, which was to succeed it in the month of\r\nMarch.\"\r\n\r\nThis question gave birth to a long discussion, during which much\r\neloquence was displayed; but the unanimous answer, with the reasons for\r\nit, may be conveyed in substance as follows:--\"It would be most wise,\"\r\nit was said, \"in the present Assembly, to introduce the question to the\r\nnotice of the nation, and this as essentially connected with the bill of\r\nrights, but to transfer the determination of it, in a way the best\r\ncalculated to ensure success, to the succeeding legislature. The\r\nrevolution was of more importance to Frenchmen than the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade. To secure this was their first object, and more\r\nparticularly because the other would naturally flow from it; but the\r\nrevolution might be injured by the immediate determination of the\r\nquestion. Many persons in the large towns of Bourdeaux, Marseilles,\r\nRouen, Nantes, and Havre, who were now friends to it, might be converted\r\ninto enemies. It would also be held up by those who wished to produce a\r\ncounter-revolution, (and the ignorant and prejudiced might believe it,)\r\nthat the Assembly had made a great sacrifice to England by thus giving\r\nher an opportunity of enlarging her trade. The English House of Commons\r\nhad taken up the subject, but had done nothing; and though they, who\r\nwere then present, were convinced of the sincerity of the English\r\nminister who had introduced it, and that the trade must ultimately fall\r\nin England, yet it would not be easy to persuade many bigoted persons in\r\nFrance of these truths. It would, therefore, be most wise in the\r\nAssembly only to introduce the subject as mentioned; but if\r\nextraordinary circumstances should arise, such as a decree that the\r\ndeputies of Colour should take their seats in the Assembly, or that\r\nEngland should have begun this great work, advantage might be taken of\r\nthem, and the abolition of the Slave Trade might be resolved upon in the\r\npresent session.\"\r\n\r\nThe last question I proposed was this:--\"If the determination of this\r\ngreat question should be proposed to the next legislature, would it be\r\nmore difficult to carry it then than now?\"\r\n\r\nThis question also produced much conversation; but the answer was\r\nunanimous, \"that there would be no greater difficulty in the one than in\r\nthe other case; for that the people would daily more and more admire\r\ntheir constitution; that this constitution would go down to the next\r\nlegislature, from whence would issue solid and fixed principles, which\r\nwould be resorted to as a standard for decision on all occasions. Hence\r\nthe Slave Trade, which would be adjudged by it also, could not possibly\r\nstand. Add to which, that the most virtuous members in the present would\r\nbe chosen into the new legislature, which, if the constitution were but\r\nonce fairly established, would not regard the murmurs of any town or\r\nprovince.\" After this a desultory conversation took place, in which some\r\nwere of opinion that it would be proper, on the introduction of the\r\nsubject into the Assembly, to move for a committee of inquiry, which\r\nshould collect facts and documents against the time when it should be\r\ntaken up with a view to its final discussion.\r\n\r\nAs it now appeared to me that nothing material would be done with\r\nrespect to our cause till after the election of the new legislature, I\r\nhad thoughts of returning to England to resume my journey in quest of\r\nevidence; but I judged it right to communicate first with the Comte de\r\nMirabeau and the Marquis de la Fayette, both of whom would have attended\r\nthe meeting just mentioned, if unforeseen circumstances had not\r\nprevented them.\r\n\r\nOn conversing with the first, I found that he differed from those whom I\r\nhad consulted. He thought that the question, on account of the nature\r\nand urgency of it, ought to be decided in the present legislature. This\r\nwas so much his opinion, that he had made a determination to introduce\r\nit there himself; and had been preparing for his motion. He had already\r\ndrawn up the outlines of a speech for the purpose; but was in want of\r\ncircumstantial knowledge to complete it. With this knowledge he desired\r\nme to furnish him. He then put his speech into my hand, and wished me to\r\ntake it home and peruse it. He wrote down, also, some questions, and he\r\ngave them to me directly afterwards, and begged I would answer them at\r\nmy leisure.\r\n\r\nOn conversing with the latter, he said, \"that he believed with those of\r\nthe meeting that there would be no greater difficulty in carrying the\r\nquestion in the succeeding than in the present legislature; but this\r\nconsideration afforded an argument for the immediate discussion of it;\r\nfor it would make a considerable difference to suffering humanity\r\nwhether it were to be decided now or then. This was the moment to be\r\ntaken to introduce it; nor did he think that they ought to be deterred\r\nfrom doing it by any supposed clamours from some of the towns in France.\r\nThe great body of the people admired the constitution, and would support\r\nany decisions which were made in strict conformity to its principles.\r\nWith respect to any committee of inquiry, he deprecated it. The Slave\r\nTrade, he said, was not a trade. It dishonoured the name of commerce. It\r\nwas piracy. But if so, the question which it involved was a question of\r\njustice only; and it could not be decided, with propriety by any other\r\nstandard.\" I then informed him that the Comte de Mirabeau had undertaken\r\nto introduce it into the Assembly. At this he expressed his uneasiness.\r\n\"Mirabeau,\" says he, \"is a host in himself; and I should not be\r\nsurprised if by his own eloquence and popularity only he were to carry\r\nit; and yet I regret that he has taken the lead in it. The cause is so\r\nlovely that even ambition, abstractedly considered, is too impure to\r\ntake it under its protection, and not to sully it. It should have been\r\nplaced in the hands of the most virtuous man in France. This man is the\r\nDuc de la Rochefoucauld. But you cannot alter things now. You cannot\r\ntake it out of his hands. I am sure he will be second to no one on this\r\noccasion.\"\r\n\r\nOn my return to my hotel, I perused the outlines of the speech which the\r\nComte de Mirabeau had lent me. It afforded a masterly knowledge of the\r\nevils of the trade, as drawn from reason only. It was put together in\r\nthe most striking and affecting manner. It contained an almost\r\nirresistible appeal to his auditors by frequent references to the\r\nancient system of things in France, and to their situation and prospects\r\nunder the new. It flowed at first gently like a river in a level\r\ncountry; but it grew afterwards into a mountain-torrent, and carried\r\neverything before it. On looking at the questions which he had written\r\ndown for me, I found them consist of three. 1. What are the different\r\nways of reducing to slavery the inhabitants of that part of Africa which\r\nis under the dominion of France? 2. What is the state of society there\r\nwith respect to government, industry, and the arts? 3. What are the\r\nvarious evils belonging to the transportation of the Africans from their\r\nown country?\r\n\r\nIt was peculiarly agreeable to me to find, on reading the first two\r\nquestions, that I had formed an acquaintance with Monsieur Geoffroy de\r\nVilleneuve, who had been aide-du-camp to the Chevalier de Boufflers at\r\nGoree; but who was then at his father's house in Paris. This gentleman\r\nhad entertained Dr. Spaarman and Mr. Wadstrom; and had accompanied them\r\nup the Senegal, when under the protection of the French government in\r\nAfrica. He had confirmed to me the testimony which they had given before\r\nthe privy council: but he had a fund of information on this subject,\r\nwhich went far beyond what these possessed, or I had ever yet collected\r\nfrom books or men. He had travelled all over the kingdom of Cayor on\r\nfoot; and had made a map of it. His information was so important, that I\r\nhad been with him for almost days together to take it down. I\r\ndetermined, therefore, to arrange the facts which I had obtained from\r\nhim, of which I had now a volume, that I might answer the two first\r\nquestions, which had been proposed to me; for it was of great importance\r\nto the Comte de Mirabeau, that he should be able to appeal, in behalf of\r\nthe statements in his speech to the Assembly, to an evidence on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my correspondence with the Comte, which continued with\r\nbut little intermission for six weeks, many circumstances took place,\r\nwhich were connected with the cause, and which I shall now detail in\r\ntheir order.\r\n\r\nOn waiting upon Mr. Necker, at his own request, he gave me the pleasing\r\nintelligence, that the committee of finances, which was then composed of\r\nmembers of the National Assembly, had resolved, though they had not yet\r\npromulgated their resolution, upon a total abolition of all the bounties\r\nthen in existence in favour of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nThe Deputies of Colour now began to visit me at my own hotel. They\r\ninformed me, that they had been admitted, since they had seen me, into\r\nthe National Assembly. On stating their claims, the president assured\r\nthem, that they might take courage; for that the assembly knew no\r\ndistinction between Blacks and Whites, but considered all men as having\r\nequal rights. This speech of the president, they said, had roused all\r\nthe White Colonists in Paris. Some of these had openly insulted them.\r\nThey had held also a meeting on the subject of this speech; at which\r\nthey had worked themselves up so as to become quite furious. Nothing but\r\nintrigue was now going forward among them to put off the consideration\r\nof the claims of the free People of Colour. They, the deputies, had been\r\nflattered by the prospect of a hearing no less than six times; and, when\r\nthe day arrived, something had constantly occurred to prevent it.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent interview, they appeared to be quite disheartened; and\r\nto be grievously disappointed as to the object of their mission. They\r\nwere now sure, that they should never be able to make head against the\r\nintrigues and plots of the White Colonists. Day after day had been fixed\r\nas before for the hearing of their cause. Day after day it had been\r\ndeferred in like manner. They were now weary with waiting. One of them,\r\nOgé, could not contain himself, but broke out with great warmth--\"I\r\nbegin,\" says he, \"not to care whether the National Assembly will admit\r\nus or not. But let it beware of the consequences. We will no longer\r\ncontinue to be beheld in a degraded light. Dispatches shall go directly\r\nto St. Domingo; and we will soon follow them. We can produce as good\r\nsoldiers on our estates, as those in France. Our own arms shall make us\r\nindependent and respectable. If we are once forced to desperate\r\nmeasures, it will be in vain that thousands will be sent across the\r\nAtlantic to bring us back to our former state.\" On hearing this, I\r\nentreated the deputies, to wait with patience. I observed to them, that\r\nin a great revolution, like that of France, things, but more\r\nparticularly such as might be thought external, could not be discussed\r\neither so soon or so rapidly as men full of enthusiasm would wish.\r\nFrance would first take care of herself. She would then, I had no doubt,\r\nextend her care to her Colonies. Was not this a reasonable conclusion,\r\nwhen they, the deputies, had almost all the first men in the Assembly in\r\ntheir favour? I entreated them therefore to wait patiently; as well as\r\nupon another consideration, which was, that by an imprudent conduct they\r\nmight not only ruin their own cause in France, but bring indescribable\r\nmisery upon their native land.\r\n\r\nBy this time a large packet, for which I had sent, from England arrived.\r\nIt consisted of above a thousand of the plan and section of a\r\nslave-ship, with an explanation in French. It contained, also, about\r\nfive hundred coloured engravings, made from two views, which Mr.\r\nWadstrom had taken in Africa. The first of these represented the town of\r\nJoal, and the king's military on horseback returning to it, after having\r\nexecuted the great pillage, with their slaves. The other represented the\r\nvillage of Bain; from whence ruffians were forcing a poor woman and her\r\nchildren to sell them to a ship, which was then lying in the Roads. Both\r\nthese scenes Mr. Wadstrom had witnessed. I had collected, also, by this\r\ntime, one thousand of my Essays on the _Impolicy of the Slave Trade_,\r\nwhich had been translated into the French language. These I now wished\r\nto distribute, as preparatory to the motion of Mirabeau, among the\r\nNational Assembly. This distribution was afterwards undertaken and\r\neffected by the Archbishop of Aix, the Bishop of Chartres, the Marquis\r\nde la Fayette, the Duc de la Rochefoucauld, the Comte de Mirabeau,\r\nMonsieur Necker, the Marquis de Condorcet, Messieurs Pétion de\r\nVilleneuve, Bergasse, Clavière and Brissot, and by the Marchioness de la\r\nFayette, Madame Necker, and Madame de Poivre, the latter of whom was the\r\nwidow of the late intendant of the Isle of France.\r\n\r\nThis distribution had not been long begun, before I witnessed its\r\neffects. The virtuous Abbé Gregoire, and several members of the National\r\nAssembly, called upon me. The section of the slave-ship, it appeared,\r\nhad been the means of drawing them towards me. They wished for more\r\naccurate information concerning it. Indeed, it made its impression upon\r\nall who saw it. The Bishop of Chartres once told me, that, when he first\r\nespoused our cause, he did it at once; for it seemed obvious to him that\r\nno one could, under the Christian dispensation, hold another as his\r\nslave; and it was no less obvious, where such an unnatural state\r\nexisted, that there would be great abuses; but that, nevertheless, he\r\nhad not given credit to all the tales which had been related of the\r\nSlave Trade, till he had seen this plate; after which there was nothing\r\nso barbarous which might not readily be believed. The Archbishop of Aix,\r\nwhen I first showed him the same plate, was so struck with horror, that\r\nhe could scarcely speak: and when Mirabeau first saw it, he was so\r\nimpressed by it, that he ordered a mechanic to make a model of it in\r\nwood, at a considerable expense. This model he kept afterwards in his\r\ndining-room. It was a ship in miniature, about a yard long, and little\r\nwooden men and women, which were painted black to represent the slaves,\r\nwere seen stowed in their proper places.\r\n\r\nBut while the distribution of these different articles thus contributed\r\nto make us many friends, it called forth the extraordinary exertions of\r\nour enemies. The merchants and others interested in the continuance of\r\nthe Slave Trade wrote letters to the Archbishop of Aix, beseeching him\r\nnot to ruin France; which he would inevitably do, if, as then president,\r\nhe were to grant a day for hearing the question of the abolition. Offers\r\nof money were made to Mirabeau from the same quarter, if he would\r\ntotally abandon his motion. An attempt was made to establish a colonial\r\ncommittee, consisting of such planters as were members of the National\r\nAssembly, upon whom it should devolve to consider and report upon all\r\nmatters relating to the Colonies, before they could be determined there.\r\nBooks were circulated in abundance in opposition to mine. Resort was\r\nagain had to the public papers, as the means of raising a hue and cry\r\nagainst the principles of the Friends of the Negroes. I was again\r\ndenounced as a spy; and as one sent by the English minister to bribe\r\nmembers in the Assembly to do that in a time of public agitation, which\r\nin the settled state of France they could never have been prevailed upon\r\nto accomplish. And as a proof that this was my errand, it was requested\r\nof every Frenchman to put to himself the following question, \"How it\r\nhappened that England, which had considered the subject coolly and\r\ndeliberately for eighteen months, and this in a state of internal peace\r\nand quietness, had not abolished the Slave Trade?\"\r\n\r\nThe clamour which was now made against the abolition pervaded all Paris,\r\nand reached the ears of the king; Mr. Necker had a long conversation\r\nwith him upon it; the latter sent for me immediately. He informed me\r\nthat His Majesty was desirous of making himself master of the question,\r\nand had expressed a wish to see my _Essay on the Impolicy of the Slave\r\nTrade_; he desired to have two copies of it, one in French, and the\r\nother in English, and he would then take his choice as to which of them\r\nhe would read; he (Mr. Necker) was to present them. He would take with\r\nhim, also, at the same time, the beautiful specimens of the manufactures\r\nof the Africans, which I had lent to Madame Necker out of the cabinet of\r\nMonsieur Geoffroy de Villeneuve and others; as to the section of the\r\nslave-ship, he thought it would affect His Majesty too much, as he was\r\nthen indisposed. All these articles, except the latter, were at length\r\npresented; the king bestowed a good deal of time upon the specimens; he\r\nadmired them, but particularly those in gold. He expressed his surprise\r\nat the state of some of the arts in Africa. He sent them back on the\r\nsame day on which he had examined them, and commissioned Mr. Necker to\r\nreturn me his thanks, and to say that he had been highly gratified with\r\nwhat he had seen; and with respect to the _Essay on the Impolicy of the\r\nSlave Trade_, that he would read it with all the seriousness which such\r\na subject deserved.\r\n\r\nMy correspondence with the Comte de Mirabeau was now drawing near to its\r\nclose. I had sent him a letter every other day for a whole month, which\r\ncontained from sixteen to twenty pages; he usually acknowledged the\r\nreceipt of each; hence many of his letters came into my possession:\r\nthese were always interesting, on account of the richness of the\r\nexpressions they contained. Mirabeau even in his ordinary discourse was\r\neloquent; it was his peculiar talent to use such words, that they who\r\nheard them were almost led to believe that he had taken great pains to\r\ncull them for the occasion. But this his ordinary language was the\r\nlanguage also of his letters; and as they show a power of expression, by\r\nwhich the reader may judge of the character of the eloquence of one, who\r\nwas then undoubtedly the greatest orator in France, I have thought it\r\nnot improper to submit one of them to his perusal in the annexed\r\nnote[A]. I could have wished, as far as it relates to myself, that it\r\nhad been less complimentary. It must be observed, however, that I had\r\nalready written to him more than two hundred pages with my own hand; and\r\nas this was done at no small expense, time, and trouble, and solely to\r\nqualify him for the office of doing good, he could not but set some\r\nvalue upon my labours.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Je fais toujours mille remercimens plus empressés et plus\r\naffectueux à Monsieur Clarkson pour la vertueuse profusion de ses\r\nlumières, de ses recherches, et de ses travaux. Comme ma motion, et tous\r\nses développemens sont entièrement prêts, j'attends avec une vive\r\nimpatience ses nouvelles lettres, afin d'achever de classer les faits et\r\nles raisonnemens de Monsieur Clarkson, et, cette déduction entièrement\r\nfinie, de commencer à manoeuvrer en tactique le succès douteux de cette\r\npérilleuse proposition. J'aurai l'honneur de le recevoir Dimanche depuis\r\nonze heures, et même dix du matin jusqu'à midi, non seulement avec un\r\nvif plaisir, mais avec une sensible reconnaissance. 25_th__Décembre_,\r\n1789.]\r\n\r\nWhen our correspondence was over, I had some conversation with him\r\nrelative to fixing a day for the motion. But he judged it prudent,\r\npreviously to this, to sound some of the members of the Assembly on the\r\nsubject of it. This he did, but he was greatly disappointed at the\r\nresult; there was not one member, out of all those with whom he\r\nconversed, who had not been canvassed by the planters' committee; and\r\nthough most of them had been proof against all its intrigues and\r\nartifices, yet many of them hesitated respecting the abolition at that\r\nmoment. There was a fear in some that they should injure the revolution\r\nby adopting it; others, who had no such fears, wished for the\r\nconcurrence of England in the measure, and suggested the propriety of a\r\ndeputation there for that purpose previously to the discussion of the\r\nquestion in France. While others maintained that, as England had done\r\nnothing, after having had it so long under consideration, it was fair to\r\npresume that she judged it impolitic to abandon the Slave Trade; but if\r\nFrance were to give it up, and England to continue it, how would\r\nhumanity be the gainer?\r\n\r\nWhile the Comte de Mirabeau was continuing his canvass among the members\r\nof the National Assembly, relative to his motion, attempts were again\r\nmade in the public papers to mislead them; emancipation was now stated\r\nto be the object of the friends of the negroes. This charge I repelled,\r\nby addressing myself to Monsieur Beauvet. I explained to him the views\r\nof the different societies which had taken up the cause of the Africans;\r\nand I desired him to show my letter to the planters. I was obliged also\r\nto answer publicly a letter by Monsieur Mosneron de Laung. This writer\r\nprofessed to detail the substance of the privy council report. He had\r\nthe injustice to assert that three things had been distinctly proved\r\nthere: First, that slavery had always existed in Africa; Secondly, that\r\nthe natives were a bloody people, addicted to human sacrifice, and other\r\nbarbarous customs; and, Thirdly, that their soil was incapable of\r\nproducing any proper articles for commerce. From these premises he\r\nargued, as if they had been established by the unanimous and\r\nuncontradicted testimony of the witnesses; and he drew the conclusion,\r\nthat not only had England done nothing in consequence, but that she\r\nnever would do anything which should affect the existence of this trade.\r\n\r\nBut these letters had only just made their appearance in the public\r\npapers, when I was summoned to England; parliament, it appeared, had\r\nmet, and I was immediately to leave Paris. Among those of whom I had but\r\njust time to take leave, were the deputies of colour. At this, my last\r\nconference with them, I recommended moderation and forbearance, as the\r\nbest gifts I could leave them; and I entreated them rather to give up\r\ntheir seats in the Assembly, than on that account to bring misery on\r\ntheir country; for that with patience their cause would ultimately\r\ntriumph. They replied, that I had prescribed to them a most difficult\r\ntask; they were afraid that neither the conduct of the white colonists\r\nnor of the National Assembly could be much longer borne; they thanked\r\nme, however, for my advice. One of them gave me a trinket, by which I\r\nmight remember him; and as for himself, he said he should never forget\r\none, who had taken such a deep interest in the welfare of his mother[A].\r\nI found, however, notwithstanding all I said, that there was a spirit of\r\ndissatisfaction in them, which nothing but a redress of their grievances\r\ncould subdue; and that, if the planters should persevere in their\r\nintrigues, and the National Assembly in delay, a fire would be lighted\r\nup in St. Domingo, which could not easily be extinguished. This was\r\nafterwards realized: for Ogé, in about three months from this time, left\r\nhis companions, to report to his constituents in St. Domingo the state\r\nof their mission; when hearing, on his arrival in that island, of the\r\noutrageous conduct of the whites of the committee of Aquin, who had\r\nbegun a persecution of the people of colour, for no other reason than\r\nthat they had dared to seek the common privileges of citizens, and of\r\nthe murder of Ferrand and Labadie, he imprudently armed his slaves. With\r\na small but faithful band he rushed upon superior numbers, and was\r\ndefeated; taking refuge at length in the Spanish part of St. Domingo, he\r\nwas given up, and his enemies, to strike terror into the people of\r\ncolour, broke him upon the wheel. From this time reconciliation between\r\nthe parties became impossible; a bloody war commenced, and with it all\r\nthose horrors which it has been our lot so frequently to deplore. It\r\nmust be remembered, however, that the Slave Trade, by means of the cruel\r\ndistinctions it occasioned, was the original cause; and though the\r\nrevolution of France afforded the occasion, it was an occasion which\r\nwould have been prevented, if it had not been for the intrigues and\r\ninjustice of the whites.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Africa.]\r\n\r\nAnother upon whom I had time to call was the amiable bishop of Chartres.\r\nWhen I left him, the Abbé Siéyes, who was with him, desired to walk with\r\nme to my hotel; he there presented me with a set of his works, which he\r\nsent for while he staid with me; and, on parting, he made use of this\r\ncomplimentary expression, in allusion, I suppose, to the cause I had\r\nundertaken,--\"I am pleased to have been acquainted with the friend of\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nIt was necessary that I should see the Comte de Mirabeau and the Marquis\r\nde la Fayette before I left Paris, I had written to each of them to\r\ncommunicate the intelligence of my departure, as soon as I received it.\r\nThe comte, it appeared had nearly canvassed the Assembly; he could count\r\nupon three hundred members, who, for the sake of justice, and without\r\nany consideration of policy or of consequences, would support his\r\nmotion. But alas! what proportion did this number bear to twelve\r\nhundred! About five hundred more would support him, but only on one\r\ncondition, which was, if England would give an unequivocal proof of her\r\nintention to abolish the trade. The knowledge of these circumstances, he\r\nsaid, had induced him to write a letter to Mr. Pitt. In this he had\r\nexplained how far he could proceed without his assistance, and how far\r\nwith it. He had frankly developed to him the mind and temper of the\r\nAssembly on this subject; but his answer must be immediate, for the\r\nwhite colonists were daily gaining such an influence there, that he\r\nforsaw that it would be impossible to carry the measure, if it were long\r\ndelayed. On taking leave of him he desired me to be the bearer of the\r\nletter, and to present it to Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\nOn conversing with the Marquis de la Fayette, he lamented deeply the\r\nunexpected turn which the cause of the Negroes had lately taken in the\r\nAssembly. It was entirely owing to the daily intrigues of the White\r\nColonists. He feared they would ruin everything. If the Deputies of\r\nColour had been heard on their arrival, their rights would have been\r\nacknowledged. But now there was little probability that they would\r\nobtain them. He foresaw nothing but desolation in St. Domingo. With\r\nrespect to the abolition of the Slave Trade, it might be yet carried;\r\nbut not unless England would concur in the measure. On this topic he\r\nenlarged with much feeling. He hoped the day was near at hand, when two\r\ngreat nations, which had been hitherto distinguished only for their\r\nhostility, one toward the other, would unite in so sublime a measure;\r\nand that they would follow up their union by another, still more lovely,\r\nfor the preservation of eternal and universal peace. Thus their future\r\nrivalships might have the extraordinary merit of being rivalships in\r\ngood. Thus the revolution of France, through the mighty aid of England,\r\nmight become the source of civilization, of freedom, and of happiness to\r\nthe whole world. No other nations were sufficiently enlightened for such\r\nan union, but all other nations might be benefited by it.\r\n\r\nThe last person whom I saw was Brissot. He accompanied me to my\r\ncarriage. With him, therefore, I shall end my French account; and I\r\nshall end it in no way so satisfactory to myself, as in a very concise\r\nvindication of his character, from actual knowledge, against the attacks\r\nof those who have endeavoured to disparage it; but who never knew him.\r\nJustice and truth, I am convinced, demand some little declaration on\r\nthis subject at my hands. Brissot then was a man of plain and modest\r\nappearance. His habits, contrary to those of his countrymen in general,\r\nwere domestic. In his own family he set an amiable example, both as a\r\nhusband and as a father. On all occasions he was a faithful friend. He\r\nwas particularly watchful over his private conduct. From the simplicity\r\nof his appearance, and the severity of his morals, he was called \"The\r\nQuaker;\" at least in all the circles which I frequented. He was a man of\r\ndeep feeling. He was charitable to the poor as far as a slender income\r\npermitted him. But his benevolence went beyond the usual bounds. He was\r\nno patriot in the ordinary acceptation of the word; for he took the\r\nhabitable globe as his country and wished to consider every foreigner as\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\nI left France, as it may be easily imagined, much disappointed, that my\r\nlabours, which had been of nearly six months continuance, should have\r\nhad no better success; nor did I see, in looking forward, any\r\ncircumstances that were consoling with respect to the issue of them\r\nthere; for it was impossible that Mr. Pitt, even if he had been inclined\r\nto write to Mirabeau, circumstanced as matters then were with respect to\r\nthe hearing of evidence, could have given him a promise, at least of a\r\nspeedy abolition; and, unless his answer had been immediate, it would\r\nhave arrived, seeing that the French planters were daily profiting by\r\ntheir intrigues, too late to be effectual.\r\n\r\nI had but just arrived in England, when Mr. Wilberforce made a new\r\nmotion in the House of Commons on the subject of the Slave Trade. In\r\nreferring to the transactions of the last session, he found that\r\ntwenty-eight days had been allotted to the hearing of witnesses against\r\nthe abolition, and that eleven persons only had been examined in that\r\ntime. If the examinations were to go on in the same manner, they might\r\nbe made to last for years. He resolved, therefore, to move, that,\r\ninstead of hearing evidence in future in the house at large, members\r\nshould hear it in an open committee above stairs; which committee should\r\nsit notwithstanding any adjournment of the house itself. This motion he\r\nmade; and in doing it he took an opportunity of correcting an erroneous\r\nreport; which was, that he had changed his mind on this great subject.\r\nThis was, he said, so far from being the case, that the more he\r\ncontemplated the trade, the more enormous he found it, and the more he\r\nfelt himself compelled to persevere in endeavours for its abolition.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that a motion, so reasonable and so\r\nconstitutional, would have met with the approbation of all; but it was\r\nvehemently opposed by Mr. Gascoyne, Alderman Newnham, and others. The\r\nplea set up was, that there was no precedent for referring a question of\r\nsuch importance to a committee. It was now obvious, that the real object\r\nof our opponents in abandoning decision by the privy council evidence\r\nwas delay. Unable to meet us there, they were glad to fly to any\r\nmeasure, which should enable them to put off the evil day. This charge\r\nwas fixed upon them in unequivocal language by Mr. Fox; who observed\r\nbesides, that if the members of the house should then resolve to hear\r\nevidence in a committee of the whole house as before, it would amount to\r\na resolution, that the question of the abolition of the Slave Trade\r\nshould be put by, or at least that it should never be decided by them.\r\nAfter a long debate, the motion of Mr. Wilberforce was voted without a\r\ndivision; and the examination of witnesses proceeded in behalf of those\r\nwho were interested in the continuance of the trade.\r\n\r\nThis measure having been resolved upon, by which despatch in the\r\nexaminations was promoted, I was alarmed lest we should be called upon\r\nfor our own evidence, before we were fully prepared. The time which I\r\nhad originally allotted for the discovery of new witnesses, had been\r\ntaken up, if not wasted, in France. In looking over the names of the\r\nsixteen, who were to have been examined by the committee of privy\r\ncouncil, if there had been time, one had died, and eight, who were\r\nsea-faring people, were out of the kingdom. It was time, therefore, to\r\nstir immediately in this business. Happily, on looking over my letters,\r\nwhich I found on my arrival in England, the names of several had been\r\nhanded to me, with the places of their abode, who could give me\r\ninformation on the subject of our question. All these I visited with the\r\nutmost despatch. I was absent only three weeks. I had travelled a\r\nthousand miles in this time, had conversed with seventeen persons, and\r\nhad prevailed upon three to be examined.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely returned with the addition of these witnesses to my list,\r\nwhen I found it necessary to go out again upon the same errand. This\r\nsecond journey arose in part from the following circumstances. There was\r\na matter in dispute relative to the mode of obtaining slaves in the\r\nrivers of Calabar and Bonny. It was usual, when the slave-ships lay\r\nthere, for a number of canoes to go into the inland country. These went\r\nin a fleet. There might be from thirty to forty armed natives in each of\r\nthem. Every canoe, also, had a four or a six-pounder (cannon) fastened\r\nto her bow. Equipped in this manner they departed; and they were usually\r\nabsent from eight to fourteen days. It was said that they went to fairs,\r\nwhich were held on the banks of these rivers, and at which there was a\r\nregular show of slaves. On their return they usually brought down from\r\neight hundred to a thousand of these for the ships. These lay at the\r\nbottom of the canoes; their arms and legs having been first bound by the\r\nropes of the country. Now the question was, how the people, thus going\r\nup these rivers, obtained their slaves?\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a very suspicious circumstance, that such a number of\r\npersons should go out upon these occasions; and that they should be\r\narmed in such a manner. We presumed, therefore, that, though they might\r\nbuy many of the slaves, whom they brought down, at the fairs which have\r\nbeen mentioned, they obtained others by violence, as opportunity\r\noffered. This inference we pressed upon our opponents, and called upon\r\nthem to show what circumstances made such warlike preparations necessary\r\non these excursions. To this they replied readily, \"The people in the\r\ncanoes,\" said they, \"pass through the territories of different petty\r\nprinces; to each of whom, on entering his territory, they pay a tribute\r\nor toll. This tribute has been long fixed; but attempts frequently have\r\nbeen made to raise it. They who follow the trade cannot afford to submit\r\nto these unreasonable demands; and therefore they arm themselves in case\r\nof any determination on the part of these petty princes to enforce\r\nthem.\" This answer we never judged to be satisfactory. We tried\r\ntherefore, to throw light upon the subject, by inquiring if the natives\r\nwho went upon these expeditions usually took with them as many goods as\r\nwould amount to the number of the slaves they were accustomed to bring\r\nback with them. But we could get no direct answer, from any actual\r\nknowledge, to this question. All had seen the canoes go out and return;\r\nbut no one had seen them loaded, or had been on board them. It appeared,\r\nhowever, from circumstantial evidence, that though the natives on these\r\noccasions might take some articles of trade with them, it was impossible\r\nfrom appearances that they could take them in the proportion mentioned.\r\nWe maintained, then, our inference as before; but it was still uniformly\r\ndenied.\r\n\r\nHow then were we to decide this important question? for it was said that\r\nno white man was ever permitted by the natives to go up in these canoes.\r\nOn mentioning accidentally the circumstances of the case, as I have now\r\nstated them, to a friend, immediately on my return from my last journey,\r\nhe informed me that he himself had been in company, about a year before,\r\nwith a sailor, a very respectable-looking man, who had been up these\r\nrivers. He had spent half an hour with him at an inn. He described his\r\nperson to me; but he knew nothing of his name, or of the place of his\r\nabode. All he knew was, that he was either going, or that he belonged\r\nto, some ship of war in ordinary; but he could not tell at what port. I\r\nmight depend upon all these circumstances if the man had not deceived\r\nhim; and he saw no reason why he should.\r\n\r\nI felt myself set on fire, as it were, by this intelligence, deficient\r\nas it was; and I seemed to determine instantly that I would, if it were\r\npossible, find him out. For if our suspicions were true that the natives\r\nfrequently were kidnapped in these expeditions, it would be of great\r\nimportance to the cause of the abolition to have them confirmed; for as\r\nmany slaves came annually from these two rivers, as from all the coast\r\nof Africa besides. But how to proceed on so blind an errand was the\r\nquestion. I first thought of trying to trace the man by letter; but this\r\nmight be tedious. The examinations were now going on rapidly. We should\r\nsoon be called upon for evidence ourselves; besides, I knew nothing of\r\nhis name. I then thought it to be a more effectual way to apply to Sir\r\nCharles Middleton, as comptroller of the navy, by whose permission I\r\ncould board every ship of war in ordinary in England, and judge for\r\nmyself. But here the undertaking seemed very arduous, and the time it\r\nwould consume became an objection in this respect, that I thought I\r\ncould not easily forgive myself, if I were to fail in it. My\r\ninclination, however, preponderated this way. At length I determined to\r\nfollow it; for, on deliberate consideration, I found that I could not\r\nemploy my time more advantageously to the cause; for as other witnesses\r\nmust be found out somewhere, it was highly probable that, if I should\r\nfail in the discovery of this man, I should, by moving among such a\r\nnumber of sea-faring people, find others who could give their testimony\r\nin our favour.\r\n\r\nI must now inform the reader, that ships of war in ordinary, in one of\r\nwhich this man was reported to be, are those which are out of\r\ncommission, and which are laid up in the different rivers and waters in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the king's dock-yards. Every one of these has a\r\nboatswain, gunner, carpenter, and assistants on board. They lie usually\r\nin divisions of ten or twelve; and a master in the navy has a command\r\nover every division.\r\n\r\nAt length I began my journey. I boarded all the ships of war lying in\r\nordinary at Deptford, and examined the different persons in each. From\r\nDeptford I proceeded to Woolwich, where I did the same. Thence I\r\nhastened to Chatham, and then, down the Medway, to Sheerness. I had now\r\nboarded above a hundred and sixty vessels of war. I had found out two\r\ngood and willing evidences among them; but I could gain no intelligence\r\nof him who was the object of my search.\r\n\r\nFrom Chatham I made the best of my way to Portsmouth harbour. A very\r\nformidable task presented itself here; but the masters' boats were ready\r\nfor me, and I continued my pursuit. On boarding the Pegase, on the\r\nsecond day, I discovered a very respectable person in the gunner of that\r\nship. His name was George Millar. He had been on board the Canterbury\r\nslaveship at the dreadful massacre at Calabar. He was the only\r\ndisinterested evidence living, of whom I had yet heard. He expressed his\r\nwillingness to give, his testimony, if his presence should be thought\r\nnecessary in London. I then continued my pursuit for the remainder of\r\nthe day. On the next day I resumed and finished it for this quarter. I\r\nhad now examined the different persons in more than a hundred vessels in\r\nthis harbour, but I had not discovered the person I had gone to seek.\r\n\r\nMatters now began to look rather disheartening, I mean as far as my\r\ngrand object was concerned. There was but one other port left, and this\r\nwas between two and three hundred miles distant. I determined, however,\r\nto go to Plymouth. I had already been more successful in this tour, with\r\nrespect to obtaining general evidences than in any other of the same\r\nlength; and the probability was, that as I should continue to move among\r\nthe same kind of people, my success would be in a similar proportion\r\naccording to the number visited. These were great encouragements to me\r\nto proceed. At length I arrived at the place of my last hope. On my\r\nfirst day's expedition I boarded forty vessels, but found no one in\r\nthese who had been on the coast of Africa in the Slave Trade. One or two\r\nhad been there in king's ships; but they had never been on shore. Things\r\nwere now drawing near to a close; and, notwithstanding my success as to\r\ngeneral evidence in this journey, my heart began to beat. I was restless\r\nand uneasy during the night. The next morning I felt agitated again\r\nbetween the alternate pressure of hope and fear; and in this state I\r\nentered my boat. The fifty-seventh vessel, which I boarded in this\r\nharbour was the Melampus frigate. One person belonging to it, on\r\nexamining him in the captain's cabin, said he had been two voyages to\r\nAfrica; and I had not long discoursed with him before I found, to my\r\ninexpressible joy, that he was the man. I found, too, that he unravelled\r\nthe question in dispute precisely as our inferences had determined it.\r\nHe had been two expeditions up the river Calabar in the canoes of the\r\nnatives. In the first of these, they came within a certain distance of a\r\nvillage. They then concealed themselves under the bushes, which hung\r\nover the water from the banks. In this position they remained during\r\nday-light; but at night they went up to it armed, and seized all the\r\ninhabitants, who had not time to make their escape. They obtained\r\nforty-five persons in this manner. In the second, they were out eight or\r\nnine days, when they made a similar attempt, and with nearly similar\r\nsuccess. They seized men, women, and children, as they could find them\r\nin the huts. They then bound their arms, and drove them before them to\r\nthe canoes. The name of the person, thus discovered on board the\r\nMelampus, was Isaac Parker. On inquiring into his character from the\r\nmaster of the division, I found it highly respectable. I found, also,\r\nafterwards, that he had sailed with Captain Cook, with great credit to\r\nhimself, round the world. It was also remarkable that my brother, on\r\nseeing him in London, when he went to deliver his evidence, recognised\r\nhim as having served on board the Monarch man-of-war, and as one of the\r\nmost exemplary men in that ship.\r\n\r\nI returned now in triumph. I had been out only three weeks, and I had\r\nfound out this extraordinary person, and five respectable witnesses\r\nbesides. These, added to the three discovered in the last journey, and\r\nto those provided before, made us more formidable than at any former\r\nperiod; so that the delay of our opponents, which we had looked upon as\r\nso great an evil, proved in the end truly serviceable to our cause.\r\n\r\nOn going into the committee-room of the House of Commons on my return, I\r\nfound that the examinations were still going on in the behalf of those\r\nwho were interested in the continuance of the trade; and they went on\r\nbeyond the middle of April, when it was considered that they had closed.\r\nMr. Wilberforce moved accordingly, on the 23rd of the same month, that\r\nCaptain Thomas Wilson, of the royal navy, and that Charles Berns\r\nWadstrom and Henry Hew Dalrymple, Esqrs., do attend as witnesses on the\r\nbehalf of the abolition. There was nothing now but clamour from those on\r\nthe opposite side of the question. They knew well that there were but\r\nfew members of the House of Commons, who had read the privy council\r\nreport. They knew, therefore, that if the question were to be decided by\r\nevidence, it must be decided by that which their own witnesses had given\r\nbefore parliament. But this was the evidence only on one side. It was\r\ncertain, therefore, if the decision were to be made upon this basis,\r\nthat it must be entirely in their favour. Will it then be believed that\r\nin an English House of Commons there could be found persons, who could\r\nmove to prevent the hearing of any other witnesses on this subject; and,\r\nwhat is more remarkable, that they should charge Mr. Wilberforce,\r\nbecause he proposed the hearing of them, with the intention solely of\r\ndelay? Yes, such persons were found; but happily only among the friends\r\nof the Slave Trade. Mr. Wilberforce, in replying to them, could not help\r\nobserving that it was rather extraordinary that they, who had occasioned\r\nthe delay of a whole year, should charge him with that of which they\r\nthemselves had been so conspicuously guilty. He then commented for some\r\ntime on the injustice of their motion. He stated, too, that he would\r\nundertake to remove from disinterested and unprejudiced persons many of\r\nthe impressions which had been made by the witnesses against the\r\nabolition; and he appealed to the justice and honour of the house in\r\nbehalf of an injured people; under the hope that they would not allow a\r\ndecision to be made till they had heard the whole of the case. These\r\nobservations, however, did not satisfy all those who belonged to the\r\nopposite party. Lord Penrhyn contended for a decision without a moment's\r\ndelay. Mr. Gascoyne relented; and said, he would allow three weeks to\r\nthe abolitionists, during which their evidence might be heard. At\r\nlength, the debate ended; in the course of which Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox\r\npowerfully supported Mr. Wilberforce; when the motion was negatived\r\nwithout any attempt at a division.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses in behalf of the abolition of the Slave Trade now took\r\npossession of the ground which those in favour of it had left. But what\r\nwas our surprise, when only three of them had been heard, to find that\r\nMr. Norris should come forward as an evidence! This he did to confirm\r\nwhat he had stated to the privy council as to the general question; but\r\nhe did it more particularly, as it appeared afterwards, in the\r\njustification of his own conduct: for the part which he had taken at\r\nLiverpool, as it related to me, had become a subject of conversation\r\nwith many. It was now well known what assistance he had given me there\r\nin my pursuit; how he had even furnished me with clauses for a bill, for\r\nthe abolition of the trade; how I had written to him, in consequence of\r\nhis friendly co-operation, to come up as an evidence in our favour; and\r\nhow at that moment he had accepted the office of a delegate on the\r\ncontrary side. The noise which the relation and repetition of these and\r\nother circumstances had made, had given him, I believe, considerable\r\npain. His friends, too, had urged some explanation as necessary. But how\r\nshort-sighted are they who do wrong! By coming forward in this imprudent\r\nmanner, he fixed the stain only the more indelibly on himself; for he\r\nthus imposed upon me the cruel necessity of being examined against him;\r\nand this necessity was the more afflicting, to me, because I was to be\r\ncalled upon not to state facts relative to the trade, but to destroy his\r\ncharacter as an evidence in its support. I was to be called upon, in\r\nfact, to explain all those communications which have been stated to have\r\ntaken place between us on this subject. Glad indeed should I have been\r\nto have declined this painful interference. But no one would hear of a\r\nrefusal. The Bishop of London, Mr. Pitt, and Mr. Wilberforce considered\r\nmy appearance on this occasion as an imperious duty to the cause of the\r\noppressed. It may be perhaps sufficient to say that I was examined; that\r\nMr. Norris was present all the time; that I was cross-examined by\r\ncounsel; and, that after this time, Mr. Norris seemed to have no\r\nordinary sense of his own degradation; for he never afterwards held up\r\nhis head or looked the abolitionists in the face, or acted with energy\r\nas a delegate, as on former occasions.\r\n\r\nThe hearing of evidence continued to go on in behalf of the abolition of\r\nthe trade. No less than twenty-four witnesses altogether were heard in\r\nthis session. And here it may not be improper to remark, that during the\r\nexamination of our own witnesses, as well as the cross-examination of\r\nthose of our opponents, no counsel were ever employed. Mr. Wilberforce\r\nand Mr. William Smith undertook this laborious department; and as they\r\nperformed it with great ability, so they did it with great liberality\r\ntowards those who were obliged to come under their notice, in the course\r\nof this fiery ordeal.\r\n\r\nThe bill of Sir William Dolben was now to be renewed. On this occasion\r\nthe enemies of the abolition became again conspicuous; for on the 26th\r\nof May, they availed themselves of a thin house to propose an amendment,\r\nby which they increased the number of the slaves to the tonnage of the\r\nvessel. They increased it, too, without taking into the account, as had\r\nhitherto been done, the extent of the superficies of the vessels which\r\nwere to carry them. This was the third indecorous attempt against what\r\nwere only reasonable and expected proceedings in the present session.\r\nBut their advantage was of no great duration; for the very next day, the\r\namendment was rejected on the report by a majority of ninety-five to\r\nsixty-nine, in consequence, principally, of the private exertions of Mr.\r\nPitt. Of this bill, though it was renewed in other years besides the\r\npresent, I shall say no more in this _History_; because it has nothing\r\nto do with the general question. Horrible as it yet left the situation\r\nof the poor slaves in their transportation, (which the plate has most\r\nabundantly shown,) it was the best bill which could be then obtained;\r\nand it answered to a certain degree the benevolent wishes of the worthy\r\nbaronet who introduced it: for if we could conclude, that these voyages\r\nwere made more comfortable to the injured Africans, in proportion as\r\nthere was less mortality in them, he had undoubtedly the pleasure of\r\nseeing the end, at least partially, obtained; though he must always have\r\nfelt a great drawback from it, by reflecting that the survivors, however\r\ntheir sufferings might have been a little diminished, were reserved for\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nThe session was now near its close; and we had the sorrow to find,\r\nthough we had defeated our opponents in the three instances which have\r\nbeen mentioned, that the tide ran decidedly against us, upon the general\r\nquestion, in the House of Commons. The same statements which had struck\r\nso many members with panic in the former sessions, such as that of\r\nemancipation, of the ruin and massacre of the planters, and of\r\nindemnification to the amount of seventy millions, had been\r\nindustriously kept up, and this by a personal canvass among them. But\r\nthis hostile disposition was still unfortunately increased by\r\nconsiderations of another sort. For the witnesses of our opponents had\r\ntaken their ground first. No less than eleven of them had been examined\r\nin the last sessions. In the present, two-thirds of the time had been\r\noccupied by others on the same side. Hence the impression upon this\r\nground also was against us; and we had yet had no adequate opportunity\r\nof doing it away. A clamour was also raised, where we thought it least\r\nlikely to have originated. They (the planters), it was said, had\r\nproduced persons in elevated life, and of the highest character, as\r\nwitnesses; whereas we had been obliged to take up with those of the\r\nlowest condition. This idea was circulated directly after the\r\nintroduction of Isaac Parker, before mentioned, a simple mariner, and\r\nwho was now contrasted with the admirals on the other side of the\r\nquestion. This outcry was not only ungenerous, but unconstitutional. It\r\nis the glory of the English law, that it has no scale of veracity which\r\nit adapts to persons, according to the station which they may be found\r\nto occupy in life. In our courts of law, the poor are heard as well as\r\nthe rich; and if their reputation be fair, and they stand proof against\r\nthe cross-examinations they undergo, both the judge and the jury must\r\ndetermine the matter in dispute by their evidence. But the House of\r\nCommons was now called upon by our opponents, to adopt the preposterous\r\nmaxim of attaching falsehood to poverty, or of weighing truth by the\r\nstandard of rank and riches.\r\n\r\nBut though we felt a considerable degree of pain in finding this adverse\r\ndisposition among so many members of the Lower House, it was some\r\nconsolation to us to know that our cause had not suffered with their\r\nconstituents,--the people. These were still warmly with us. Indeed,\r\ntheir hatred of the trade had greatly increased. Many circumstances had\r\noccurred in this year to promote it. The committee, during my absence in\r\nFrance, had circulated the plate of the slave-ship throughout all\r\nEngland. No one saw it but he was impressed. It spoke to him in a\r\nlanguage which was at once intelligible and irresistible. It brought\r\nforth the tear of sympathy in behalf of the sufferers, and it fixed\r\ntheir sufferings in his heart. The committee, too, had been particularly\r\nvigilant during the whole of the year with respect to the public papers.\r\nThey had suffered no statement in behalf of those interested in the\r\ncontinuance of the trade to go unanswered. Dr. Dickson, the author of\r\nthe _Letters on Slavery_, before mentioned, had come forward again with\r\nhis services on this occasion; and, by his active co-operation with a\r\nsub-committee appointed for the purpose, the coast was so well cleared\r\nof our opponents, that, though they were seen the next year again,\r\nthrough the medium of the same papers, they appeared only in sudden\r\nincursions, as it were, during which they darted a few weapons at us;\r\nbut they never afterward ventured upon the plain to dispute the matter,\r\ninch by inch, or point by point, in an open and manly manner.\r\n\r\nBut other circumstances occurred to keep up a hatred of the trade among\r\nthe people in this interval, which, trivial as they were, ought not to\r\nbe forgotten. The amiable poet Cowper had frequently made the Slave\r\nTrade the subject of his contemplation. He had already severely\r\ncondemned it in his valuable poem _The Task_. But now he had written\r\nthree little fugitive pieces upon it. Of these, the most impressive was\r\nthat which he called _The Negro's Complaint_, and of which the following\r\nis a copy:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Forced from home and all its pleasures,\r\n    Afric's coast I left forlorn,\r\n  To increase a stranger's treasures,\r\n    O'er the raging billows borne;\r\n  Men from England bought and sold me,\r\n    Paid my price in paltry gold;\r\n  But, though theirs they have enroll'd me,\r\n    Minds are never to be sold.\r\n\r\n  Still in thought as free as ever,\r\n    What are England's rights, I ask,\r\n  Me from my delights to sever,\r\n    Me to torture, me to task?\r\n  Fleecy locks and black complexion\r\n    Cannot forfeit Nature's claim;\r\n  Skins may differ, but affection\r\n    Dwells in black and white the same.\r\n\r\n  Why did all-creating Nature\r\n    Make the plant, for which we toil?\r\n  Sighs must fan it, tears must water,\r\n    Sweat of ours must dress the soil.\r\n  Think, ye masters, iron-hearted,\r\n    Lolling at your jovial boards,\r\n  Think, how many backs have smarted\r\n    For the sweets your cane affords.\r\n\r\n  Is there, as you sometimes tell us,\r\n    Is there one, who rules on high;\r\n  Has he bid you buy and sell us,\r\n    Speaking from his throne, the sky?\r\n  Ask him, if your knotted scourges,\r\n    Fetters, blood-extorting screws,\r\n  Are the means, which duty urges\r\n    Agents of his will to use?\r\n\r\n  Hark! he answers. Wild tornadoes,\r\n    Strewing yonder sea with wrecks,\r\n  Wasting towns, plantations, meadows,\r\n    Are the voice with which he speaks.\r\n  He, foreseeing what vexations\r\n    Afric's sons should undergo,\r\n  Fixed their tyrants' habitations\r\n    Where his whirlwinds answer--No.\r\n\r\n  By our blood in Afric wasted,\r\n    Ere our necks received the chain;\r\n  By the miseries, which we tasted\r\n    Crossing, in your barks, the main;\r\n  By our sufferings, since you brought us\r\n    To the man-degrading mart,\r\n  All-sustained by patience, taught us\r\n    Only by a broken heart:\r\n\r\n  Deem our nation brutes no longer,\r\n    Till some reason you shall find\r\n  Worthier of regard, and stronger,\r\n    Than the colour of our kind.\r\n  Slaves of gold! whose sordid dealings\r\n    Tarnish all, your boasted powers,\r\n  Prove that you have human feelings,\r\n    Ere you proudly question ours.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little piece Cowper presented in manuscript to some of his friends\r\nin London; and these, conceiving it to contain a powerful appeal in\r\nbehalf of the injured Africans, joined in printing it. Having ordered it\r\non the finest hot-pressed paper, and folded it up in a small and neat\r\nform, they gave it the printed title of _A Subject for Conversation at\r\nthe Tea-table_. After this, they sent many thousand copies of it in\r\nfranks into the country. From one it spread to another, till it\r\ntravelled almost over the whole island. Falling at length into the hands\r\nof the musician, it was set to music; and it then found its way into the\r\nstreets, both of the metropolis and of the country, where it was sung as\r\na ballad; and where it gave a plain account of the subject, with an\r\nappropriate feeling, to those who heard it.\r\n\r\nNor was the philanthropy of the late Mr. Wedgewood less instrumental in\r\nturning the popular feeling in our favour. He made his own manufactory\r\ncontribute to this end. He took the seal of the committee, as exhibited\r\nin Chap. XX., for his model; and he produced a beautiful cameo, of a\r\nless size, of which the ground was a most delicate white, but the Negro,\r\nwho was seen imploring compassion in the middle of it, was in his own\r\nnative colour. Mr. Wedgewood made a liberal donation of these, when\r\nfinished, among his friends. I received from him no less than five\r\nhundred of them myself. They, to whom they were sent, did not lay them\r\nup in their cabinets, but gave them away likewise. They were soon, like\r\n_The Negro's Complaint_, in different parts of the kingdom. Some had\r\nthem inlaid in gold on the lid of their snuff-boxes. Of the ladies,\r\nseveral wore them in bracelets, and others had them fitted up in an\r\nornamental manner as pins for their hair. At length the taste for\r\nwearing them became general; and thus fashion, which usually confines\r\nitself to worthless things, was seen for once in the honourable office\r\nof promoting the cause of justice, humanity, and freedom.\r\n\r\nI shall now only state that the committee took as members within its own\r\nbody, in the period of time which is included in this chapter, the\r\nReverend Mr. Ormerod, chaplain to the Bishop of London, and Captain\r\nJames Bowen, of the royal navy; that they elected the Honourable\r\nNathaniel Curzon (afterwards Lord Scarsdale), Dr. Frossard, of Lyons,\r\nand Benjamin Garlike, Esq., then secretary to the English embassy at the\r\nHague, honorary and corresponding members; and that they concluded their\r\nannual labours with a suitable report, in which they noticed the\r\nextraordinary efforts of our opponents to injure our cause in the\r\nfollowing manner:--\"In the progress of this business, a powerful\r\ncombination of interest has been excited against us. The African trader,\r\nthe planter, and the West India merchant, have united their forces to\r\ndefend the fortress, in which their supposed treasures lie. Vague\r\ncalculations and false alarms have been thrown out to the public, in\r\norder to show that the constitution, and even the existence, of this\r\nfree and opulent nation depend on its depriving the inhabitants of a\r\nforeign country of those rights and of that liberty which we ourselves\r\nso highly and so justly prize. Surely, in the nature of things, and in\r\nthe order of Providence, it cannot be so. England existed as a great\r\nnation long before the African commerce was known amongst us, and it is\r\nnot to acts of injustice and violence that she owes her present rank in\r\nthe scale of nations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n--Continuation from July, 1790, to July, 1791.--Author travels again\r\nthroughout the kingdom; object of his journey.--Motion in the House of\r\nCommons to resume the hearing of evidence in favour of the abolition;\r\nlist of all those examined on this side of the question; machinations\r\nof interested persons, and cruel circumstances of the times previously\r\nto the day of decision.--Motion at length made for stopping all\r\nfurther importation of Slaves from Africa; debates upon it; motion\r\nlost.--Resolutions of the committee for the Abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade.--Establishment of the Sierra Leone Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of deep affliction to us to think, that the crimes and\r\nsufferings inseparable from the Slave Trade were to be continued to\r\nanother year. And yet it was our duty, in the present moment, to\r\nacquiesce in the postponement of the question. This postponement was not\r\nnow for the purpose of delay, but of securing victory. The evidence, on\r\nthe side of the abolition, was, at the end of the last session, but half\r\nfinished. It was impossible, for the sake of Africa, that we could have\r\nthen closed it. No other opportunity might offer in parliament for\r\nestablishing an indelible record in her favour, if we were to neglect\r\nthe present. It was our duty, therefore, even to wait to complete it,\r\nand to procure such a body of evidence, as should not only bear us out\r\nin the approaching contest, but such as, if we were to fail, would bear\r\nout our successors also. It was possible, indeed, if the inhabitants of\r\nour islands were to improve in civilization, that the poor slaves might\r\nexperience gradually an improved treatment with it; and so far testimony\r\nnow might not be testimony for ever; but it was utterly impossible,\r\nwhile the Slave Trade lasted, and the human passion continued to be the\r\nsame, that there should be any change for the better in Africa; or that\r\nany modes, less barbarous, should come into use for procuring slaves.\r\nEvidence, therefore, if once collected on this subject, would be\r\nevidence for posterity. In the midst of these thoughts another journey\r\noccurred to me as necessary for this purpose; and I prayed, that I might\r\nhave strength to perform it in the most effectual manner; and that I\r\nmight be daily impressed, as I travelled along, with the stimulating\r\nthought, that the last hope for millions might possibly rest upon my own\r\nendeavours.\r\n\r\nThe committee highly approved of this journey; Mr. Wilberforce saw the\r\nabsolute necessity of it also, and had prepared a number of questions,\r\nwith great ingenuity, to be put to such persons as might have\r\ninformation to communicate. These I added to those in the tables, which\r\nhave been already mentioned, and they made together a valuable\r\ncollection on the subject.\r\n\r\nThis tour was the most vexatious of any I had yet undertaken; many still\r\nrefused to come forward to be examined, and some on the most frivolous\r\npretences, so that I was disgusted, as I journeyed on, to find how\r\nlittle men were disposed to make sacrifices for so great a cause. In one\r\npart of it I went over nearly two thousand miles, receiving repeated\r\nrefusals; I had not secured one witness within this distance; this was\r\ntruly disheartening. I was subject to the whims and caprice of those\r\nwhom I solicited on these occasions[A]; to these I was obliged to\r\naccommodate myself. When at Edinburgh, a person who could have given me\r\nmaterial information declined seeing me, though he really wished well to\r\nthe cause; when I had returned southward as far as York, he changed his\r\nmind, and he would then see me; I went back that I might not lose him.\r\nWhen I arrived, he would give me only private information. Thus I\r\ntravelled, backwards and forwards, four hundred miles to no purpose. At\r\nanother place a circumstance almost similar happened, though with a\r\ndifferent issue. I had been for two years writing about a person, whose\r\ntestimony was important. I had passed once through the town in which he\r\nlived, but he would not then see me; I passed through it now, but no\r\nentreaties of his friends could make him alter his resolution. He was a\r\nman highly respectable as to situation in life, but of considerable\r\nvanity. I said therefore to my friend, on leaving the town, You may tell\r\nhim that I expect to be at Nottingham in a few days, and though it be a\r\nhundred and fifty miles distant, I will even come back to see him if he\r\nwill dine with me on my return. A letter from my friend announced to me,\r\nwhen at Nottingham, that his vanity had been so gratified by the thought\r\nof a person coming expressly to visit him from such a distance, that he\r\nwould meet me according to my appointment; I went back; we dined\r\ntogether; he yielded to my request; I was now repaid, and I returned\r\ntowards Nottingham in the night. These circumstances I mention, and I\r\nfeel it right to mention them, that the reader may be properly impressed\r\nwith the great difficulties we found in collecting a body of evidence in\r\ncomparison with our opponents. They ought never to be forgotten; for if\r\nwith the testimony, picked up as it were under all these disadvantages,\r\nwe carried our object against those who had almost numberless witnesses\r\nto command, what must have been the merits of our cause! No person can\r\nindeed judge of the severe labour and trials in these journeys. In the\r\npresent, I was out four months; I was almost over the whole island; I\r\nintersected it backwards and forwards both in the night and in the day;\r\nI travelled nearly seven thousand miles in this time, and I was able to\r\ncount upon twenty new and willing evidences.\r\n\r\nHaving now accomplished my object, Mr. Wilberforce moved on the 4th of\r\nFebruary in the House of Commons, that a committee be appointed to\r\nexamine further witnesses in behalf of the abolition of the Slave Trade,\r\nThis motion was no sooner made, than Mr. Cawthorne rose, to our great\r\nsurprise, to oppose it. He took upon himself to decide that the House\r\nhad heard evidence enough. This indecent motion was not without its\r\nadvocates. Mr. Wilberforce set forth the injustice of this attempt, and\r\nproved, that out of eighty-one days which had been given up to the\r\nhearing of evidence, the witnesses against the abolition had occupied no\r\nless than fifty-seven. He was strenuously supported by Mr. Burke, Mr.\r\nMartin, and other respectable members. At length the debate ended in\r\nfavour of the original motion, and a committee was appointed\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThe examinations began again on February 7th, and continued till April\r\n5th, when they were finally closed. In this, as in the former session,\r\nMr. Wilberforce and Mr. William Smith principally conducted them; and\r\nindeed it was necessary that they should have been present at these\r\ntimes; for it is perhaps difficult to conceive the illiberal manner in\r\nwhich our witnesses were treated by those on the other side of the\r\nquestion. Men who had left the trade upon principle, and who had come\r\nforward, against their apparent interest, to serve the cause of humanity\r\nand justice, were looked upon as mercenaries and culprits, or as men of\r\ndoubtful and suspicious character; they were brow-beaten; unhandsome\r\nquestions were put to them; some were kept for four days under\r\nexamination. It was however highly to their honour that they were found\r\nin no one instance to prevaricate, nor to waver as to the certainty of\r\ntheir facts.\r\n\r\nBut this treatment, hard as it was for them to bear, was indeed good for\r\nthe cause; for, coming thus pure out of the fire, they occasioned their\r\nown testimony, when read, to bear stronger marks of truth than that of\r\nthe generality of our opponents; nor was it less superior when weighed\r\nby other considerations. For the witnesses, against the abolition were\r\nprincipally interested; they, who were not, had been hospitably received\r\nat the planters' tables. The evidence, too, which they delivered, was\r\nalmost wholly negative. They had not seen such and such evils; but this\r\nwas no proof that the evils did not exist. The witnesses, on the other\r\nhand, who came up in favour of the abolition, had no advantage in making\r\ntheir several assertions. In some instances they came up against their\r\napparent interest, and, to my knowledge, suffered persecution for so\r\ndoing. The evidence also which they delivered was of a positive nature.\r\nThey gave an account of specific evils, which had come under their own\r\neyes; these evils were never disproved; they stood therefore on a firm\r\nbasis, as on a tablet of brass. Engraved there in affirmative\r\ncharacters, a few of them were of more value than all the negative and\r\nairy testimony which had been advanced on the other side of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThat the public may judge, in some measure, of the respectability of the\r\nwitnesses in favour of the abolition, and that they may know also to\r\nwhom Africa is so much indebted for her deliverance, I shall subjoin\r\ntheir names in the three following lists. The first will contain those\r\nwho were examined by the privy council only; the second those who were\r\nexamined by the privy council and the House of Commons also; and the\r\nthird those who were examined-by the House of Commons only.\r\n\r\nLIST I.\r\n\r\nLIST II.\r\n\r\nLIST III.\r\n\r\nThe evidence having been delivered on both sides, and then printed, it\r\nwas judged expedient by Mr. Wilberforce, seeing that it filled three\r\nfolio volumes, to abridge it. This abridgement was made by the different\r\nfriends of the cause. William Burgh, Esq., of York; Thomas Babington,\r\nEsq., of Rothley Temple; the Rev. Thomas Gisborne, of Yoxall Lodge; Mr.\r\nCampbell Haliburton, of Edinburgh; George Harrison, with one or two\r\nothers of the committee, and myself, were employed upon it. The greater\r\nshare, however, of the labour, fell upon Dr. Dickson. That no\r\nmisrepresentation of any person's testimony might be made, Matthew\r\nMontagu, Esq., and the Honourable E.J. Elliott, members of Parliament,\r\nundertook to compare the abridged manuscripts with the original text,\r\nand to strike out or correct whatever they thought to be erroneous, and\r\nto insert whatever they thought to have been omitted. The committee for\r\nthe abolition, when the work was finished, printed it at their own\r\nexpense, Mr. Wilberforce then presented it to the House of Commons, as a\r\nfaithful abridgement of the whole evidence. Having been received as\r\nsuch, under the guarantee of Mr. Montague and Mr. Elliott, the committee\r\nsent it to every individual member of that House.\r\n\r\nThe book having been thus presented, and a day fixed for the final\r\ndetermination of the question, our feelings became almost insupportable;\r\nfor we had the mortification to find, that our cause was going down in\r\nestimation, where it was then most important that it should have\r\nincreased in favour. Our opponents had taken advantage of the long delay\r\nwhich the examination of evidence had occasioned, to prejudice the minds\r\nof many of the members of the House of Commons against us. The old\r\narguments of emancipation, massacre, ruin, and indemnification, had been\r\nkept up; but, as the day of final decision approached, they had been\r\nincreased. Such was our situation at this moment, when the current was\r\nturned still more powerfully against us by the peculiar circumstances of\r\nthe times. It was, indeed, the misfortune of this great cause to be\r\nassailed by every weapon which could be turned against it. At this time,\r\nThomas Paine had published his _Rights of Man_. This had been widely\r\ncirculated. At this time, also, the French revolution had existed nearly\r\ntwo years. The people of England had seen, during this interval, a\r\ngovernment as it were dissected. They had seen an old constitution taken\r\ndown, and a new one put up, piece by piece, in its stead. The\r\nrevolution, therefore, in conjunction with the book in question, had had\r\nthe effect of producing dissatisfaction among thousands; and this\r\ndissatisfaction was growing, so as to alarm a great number of persons of\r\nproperty in the kingdom, as well as the government itself. Now will it\r\nbe believed that our opponents had the injustice to lay hold of these\r\ncircumstances, at this critical moment, to give a death-blow to the\r\ncause of the abolition? They represented the committee, though it had\r\nexisted before the French revolution, or the _Rights of Man_ were heard\r\nof, as a nest of Jacobins; and they held up the cause, sacred as it was,\r\nand though it had the support of the minister, as affording an\r\nopportunity of meeting for the purpose of overthrowing the state. Their\r\ncry succeeded. The very book of the abridgment of the evidence was\r\nconsidered by many members as poisonous as that of the _Rights of Man_.\r\nIt was too profane for many of them to touch; and they who discarded it,\r\ndiscarded the cause also.\r\n\r\nBut these were not the only circumstances which were used as means, at\r\nthis critical moment, to defeat us. News of the revolution, which had\r\ncommenced in St. Domingo, in consequence of the disputes between the\r\nwhites and the people of colour, had, long before this, arrived in\r\nEngland. The horrible scenes which accompanied it, had been frequently\r\npublished as so many arguments against our cause. In January, new\r\ninsurrections were announced as having happened in Martinique. The\r\nnegroes there were described as armed, and the planters as having\r\nabandoned their estates for fear of massacre. Early in the month of\r\nMarch, insurrections in the smaller French islands were reported. Every\r\neffort was then made to represent these as the effects of the new\r\nprinciples of liberty, and of the cry for abolition. But what should\r\nhappen, just at this moment, to increase the clamour against us? Nothing\r\nless than an insurrection in Dominica.--Yes!--An insurrection in a\r\nBritish island. This was the very event for our opponents. \"All the\r\npredictions of the planters had now become verified. The horrible\r\nmassacres were now realizing at home.\" To give this news still greater\r\neffect, a meeting of our opponents was held at the London Tavern. By a\r\nletter read there, it appeared that \"the ruin of Dominica was now at\r\nhand.\" Resolutions were voted, and a memorial presented to government,\r\n\"immediately to despatch such a military force to the different islands,\r\nas might preserve the whites from destruction, and keep the negroes in\r\nsubjection during the present critical state of the slave bill.\" This\r\nalarm was kept up till the 7th of April, when another meeting took\r\nplace, to receive the answer of government to the memorial. It was there\r\nresolved that, \"as it was too late to send troops to the islands, the\r\nbest way of preserving them would be to bring the question of the Slave\r\nTrade to an immediate issue; and that it was the duty of the government,\r\nif they regarded the safety of the islands, to oppose the abolition of\r\nit.\"  Accounts of all these proceedings were inserted in the public\r\npapers. It is needless to say that they were injurious to our cause.\r\nMany looked upon the abolitionists as monsters. They became also\r\nterrified themselves. The idea with these was, that unless the\r\ndiscussion on this subject was terminated, all would be lost. Thus,\r\nunder a combination of effects, arising from the publication of the\r\n_Rights of Man_, the rise and progress of the French revolution, and the\r\ninsurrections of the negroes in the different islands, no one of which\r\nevents had anything to do with the abolition of the Slave Trade, the\r\ncurrent was turned against us; and in this unfavourable frame of mind\r\nmany members of parliament went into the House, on the day fixed for the\r\ndiscussion, to discharge their duty with respect to this great question.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April, Mr. Wilberforce made his motion. He began by\r\nexpressing a hope, that the present debate, instead of exciting asperity\r\nand confirming prejudice, would tend to produce a general conviction of\r\nthe truth of what in fact was incontrovertible; that the abolition of\r\nthe Slave Trade was indispensably required of them, not only by morality\r\nand religion, but by sound policy. He stated that he should argue the\r\nmatter from evidence. He adverted to the character, situation, and means\r\nof information of his own witnesses; and having divided his subject into\r\nparts, the first of which related to the manner of reducing the natives\r\nof Africa to a state of slavery, he handled it in the following\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\nHe would begin, he said, with the first boundary of the trade. Captain\r\nWilson and Captain Hills, of His Majesty's navy, and Mr. Dalrymple, of\r\nthe land service, had concurred in stating, that in the country\r\ncontiguous to the river Senegal, when slave-ships arrived there, armed\r\nparties were regularly sent out in the evening, who scoured the country,\r\nand brought in their prey. The wretched victims were to be seen in the\r\nmorning bound back to back in the huts on shore, whence they were\r\nconveyed, tied hand and foot, to the slave-ships. The design of these\r\nravages was obvious, because, when the Slave Trade was stopped, they\r\nceased. Mr. Kiernan spoke of the constant depredations by the Moors to\r\nprocure slaves. Mr. Wadstrom confirmed them. The latter gentleman showed\r\nalso that they were excited by presents of brandy, gunpowder, and such\r\nother incentives; and that they were not only carried on by one\r\ncommunity against another, but that the kings were stimulated to\r\npractise them in their territories, and on their own subjects: and in\r\none instance a chieftain, who, when intoxicated, could not resist the\r\ndemands of the slave merchants, had expressed, in a moment of reason, a\r\ndue sense of his own crime, and had reproached his Christian seducers.\r\nAbundant also were the instances of private rapine. Individuals were\r\nkidnapped, whilst in their fields and gardens. There was an universal\r\nfeeling of distrust and apprehension there. The natives never went any\r\ndistance from home without arms; and when Captain Wilson asked them the\r\nreason of it, they pointed to a slave-ship then lying within sight.\r\n\r\nOn the windward coast, it appeared from Lieutenant Story and Mr. Bowman,\r\nthat the evils just mentioned existed, if possible, in a still higher\r\ndegree. They had seen the remains of villages, which had been burnt,\r\nwhilst the fields of corn were still standing beside them, and every\r\nother trace of recent desolation. Here an agent was sent to establish a\r\nsettlement in the country, and to send to the ships such slaves as he\r\nmight obtain. The orders he received from his captain were, that \"he was\r\nto encourage the chieftains by brandy and gunpowder to go to war, to\r\nmake slaves.\" This he did. The chieftains performed their part in\r\nreturn. The neighbouring villages were surrounded and set on fire in the\r\nnight. The inhabitants were seized when making their escape; and, being\r\nbrought to the agent, were by him forwarded to his principal on the\r\ncoast. Mr. How, a botanist in the service of Government, stated, that on\r\nthe arrival of an order for slaves from Cape Coast Castle, while he was\r\nthere, a native chief immediately sent forth armed parties, who brought\r\nin a supply of all descriptions in the night.\r\n\r\nBut he would now mention one or two instances of another sort, and these\r\nmerely on account of the conclusion, which was to be drawn from them.\r\nWhen Captain Hills was in the river Gambia, he mentioned accidentally to\r\na Black pilot, who was in the boat with him, that he wanted a cabin-boy.\r\nIt so happened that some youths were then on the shore with vegetables\r\nto sell. The pilot beckoned to them to come on board; at the same time\r\ngiving Captain Hills to understand, that he might take his choice of\r\nthem; and when Captain Hills rejected the proposal with indignation, the\r\npilot seemed perfectly at a loss to account for his warmth; and drily\r\nobserved, that the slave-captains would not have been so scrupulous.\r\nAgain, when General Rooke commanded at Goree, a number of the natives,\r\nmen, women, and children, came to pay him a friendly visit. All was\r\ngaiety and merriment. It was a scene to gladden the saddest, and to\r\nsoften the hardest, heart. But a slave-captain was not so soon thrown\r\noff his guard. Three English barbarians of this description had the\r\naudacity jointly to request the general, to seize the whole unsuspicious\r\nmultitude and sell them. For this they alleged the precedent of a former\r\ngovernor. Was not this request a proof of the frequency of such acts of\r\nrapine? for how familiar must such have been to slave-captains, when\r\nthree of them dared to carry a British officer of rank such a flagitious\r\nproposal! This would stand in the place of a thousand instances. It\r\nwould give credibility to every other act of violence stated in the\r\nevidence, however enormous it might appear.\r\n\r\nBut he would now have recourse for a moment to circumstantial evidence.\r\nAn adverse witness, who had lived on the Gold Coast, had said that the\r\nonly way in which children could he enslaved, was by whole families\r\nbeing sold when the principals had been condemned for witchcraft. But he\r\nsaid at the same time, that few were convicted of this crime, and that\r\nthe younger part of a family in these cases was sometimes spared. But if\r\nthis account were true, it would follow that the children in the\r\nslave-vessels would be few indeed. But it had been proved, that the\r\nusual proportion of these was never less than a fourth of the whole\r\ncargo on the coast, and also, that the kidnapping of children was very\r\nprevalent there.\r\n\r\nAll these atrocities, he said, were fully substantiated by the evidence;\r\nand here he should do injustice to his cause, if he were not to make a\r\nquotation from the speech of Mr. B. Edwards in the Assembly of Jamaica,\r\nwho, though he was hostile to his propositions, had yet the candour to\r\ndeliver himself in the following manner there. \"I am persuaded,\" says\r\nhe, \"that Mr. Wilberforce has been rightly informed as to the manner in\r\nwhich slaves are generally procured. The intelligence I have collected\r\nfrom my own negroes abundantly confirms his account; and I have not the\r\nsmallest doubt, that in Africa the effects of this trade are precisely\r\nsuch as he has represented them. The whole, or the greatest part, of\r\nthat immense continent is a field of warfare and desolation; a\r\nwilderness, in which the inhabitants are wolves towards each other. That\r\nthis scene of oppression, fraud, treachery, and bloodshed, if not\r\noriginally occasioned, is in part (I will not say wholly) upheld by the\r\nSlave Trade, I dare not dispute. Every man in the Sugar Islands may be\r\nconvinced that it is so, who will enquire of any African negroes, on\r\ntheir first arrival, concerning the circumstances of their captivity.\r\nThe assertion that it is otherwise, is mockery and insult.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not only by acts of outrage that the Africans were brought\r\ninto bondage. The very administration of justice was turned into an\r\nengine for that end. The smallest offence was punished by a fine equal\r\nto the value of a slave. Crimes were also fabricated; false accusations\r\nwere resorted to; and persons were sometimes employed to seduce the\r\nunwary into practices with a view to the conviction and the sale of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was another effect of this trade, that it corrupted the morals of\r\nthose who carried it on. Every fraud was used to deceive the ignorance\r\nof the natives by false weights and measures, adulterated commodities,\r\nand other impositions of a like sort. These frauds were even\r\nacknowledged by many who had themselves practised them, in obedience to\r\nthe orders of their superiors. For the honour of the mercantile\r\ncharacter of the country, such a traffic ought immediately to be\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nYet these things, however clearly proved by positive testimony, by the\r\nconcession of opponents, by particular inference, by general reasoning,\r\nby the most authentic histories of Africa, by the experience of all\r\ncountries and of all ages,--these things, and (what was still more\r\nextraordinary) even the possibility of them, were denied by those who\r\nhad been brought forward on the other side of the question. These,\r\nhowever, were chiefly persons who had been trading-governors of forts in\r\nAfrica, or who had long commanded ships in the Slave Trade. As soon as\r\nhe knew the sort of witnesses which was to be called against him, he had\r\nbeen prepared to expect much prejudice. But his expectations had been\r\ngreatly surpassed by the testimony they had given. He did not mean to\r\nimpeach their private characters, but they certainly showed themselves\r\nunder the influence of such gross prejudices, as to render them\r\nincompetent judges of the subject they came to elucidate. They seemed\r\n(if he might so say) to be enveloped by a certain atmosphere of their\r\nown; and to see, as it were, through a kind of African medium. Every\r\nobject which met their eyes came distorted and turned from its true\r\ndirection. Even the declarations, which they made on other occasions,\r\nseemed wholly strange to them. They sometimes not only forgot what they\r\nhad seen, but what they had said; and when to one of them his own\r\ntestimony to the privy council was read, he mistook it for that of\r\nanother, whose evidence he declared to be \"the merest burlesque in the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nBut the House must be aware that there was not only an African medium,\r\nbut an African logic. It seemed to be an acknowledged axiom in this,\r\nthat every person who offered a slave for sale had a right to sell him,\r\nhowever fraudulently he might have obtained him. This had been proved by\r\nthe witnesses who opposed him. \"It would have stopped my trade,\" said\r\none of them, \"to have asked the broker how he came by the person he was\r\noffering me for sale.\"--\"We always suppose,\" said another, \"the broker\r\nhas a right to sell the person he offers us.\"--\"I never heard of such a\r\nquestion being asked,\" said a third; \"a man would be thought a fool who\r\nshould put such a question.\"--He hoped the House would see the practical\r\nutility of this logic. It was the key-stone which held the building\r\ntogether. By means of it, slave-captains might traverse the whole coast\r\nof Africa, and see nothing but equitable practices. They could not,\r\nhowever, be wholly absolved, even if they availed themselves of this\r\nprinciple to its fullest extent; for they had often committed\r\ndepredations themselves; especially when they were passing by any part\r\nof the coast, where they did not mean to continue or to go again. Hence\r\nit was (as several captains of the navy and others had declared on their\r\nexamination), that the natives, when at sea in their canoes, would never\r\ncome near the men-of-war, till they knew them to be such. But finding\r\nthis, and that they were not slave-vessels, they laid aside their fears,\r\nand came and continued on board with unsuspecting cheerfulness. With\r\nrespect to the miseries of the Middle Passage, he had said so much on a\r\nformer occasion, that he would spare the feelings of the committee as\r\nmuch as he could. He would therefore simply state that the evidence,\r\nwhich was before them, confirmed all those scenes of wretchedness which\r\nhe had then described: the same suffering from a state of suffocation,\r\nby being crowded together; the same dancing in fetters; the same\r\nmelancholy singing; the same eating by compulsion; the same despair; the\r\nsame insanity; and all the other abominations which characterized the\r\ntrade. New instances however had occurred, where these wretched men had\r\nresolved on death to terminate their woes. Some had destroyed themselves\r\nby refusing sustenance, in spite of threats and punishments. Others had\r\nthrown themselves into the sea; and more than one, when in the act of\r\ndrowning, were seen to wave their hands in triumph, \"exulting\" (to use\r\nthe words of an eye-witness) \"that they had escaped.\" Yet these and\r\nsimilar things, when viewed through the African medium he had mentioned,\r\ntook a different shape and colour. Captain Knox, an adverse witness, had\r\nmaintained, that slaves lay during the night in tolerable comfort. And\r\nyet he confessed, that in a vessel of one hundred and twenty tons, in\r\nwhich he had carried two hundred and ninety slaves, the latter had not\r\nall of them room to lie on their backs. How comfortably, then, must they\r\nhave lain in his subsequent voyages! for he carried afterwards, in a\r\nvessel of a hundred and eight tons, four hundred and fifty; and in a\r\nvessel of one hundred and fifty tons, no less than six hundred slaves.\r\nAnother instance of African deception was to be found in the testimony\r\nof Captain Frazer, one of the most humane captains in the trade. It had\r\nbeen said of him, that he had held hot coals to the mouth of a slave, to\r\ncompel him to eat. He was questioned on this point; but not admitting,\r\nin the true spirit of African logic, that he who makes another commit a\r\ncrime is guilty of it himself, he denied the charge indignantly, and\r\ndefied a proof. But it was said to him, \"Did you never order such a\r\nthing to be done?\" His reply was, \"Being sick in my cabin, I was\r\ninformed that a man-slave would neither eat, drink, nor speak. I desired\r\nthe mate and surgeon to try to persuade him to speak. I desired that the\r\nslaves might try also. When I found he was still obstinate, not knowing\r\nwhether it was from sulkiness or insanity, I ordered a person to present\r\nhim with a piece of fire in one hand, and a piece of yam in the other,\r\nand to tell me what effect this had upon him. I learnt that he took the\r\nyam and began to eat it, but he threw the fire overboard.\" Such was his\r\nown account of the matter. This was eating by duresse, if anything could\r\nbe called so. The captain, however, triumphed in his expedient; and\r\nconcluded by telling the committee, that he sold this very slave at\r\nGrenada for forty pounds. Mark here the moral of the tale, and learn the\r\nnature and the cure of sulkiness.\r\n\r\nBut upon whom did the cruelties, thus arising out of the prosecution of\r\nthis barbarous traffic, fall? Upon a people with feeling and intellect\r\nlike ourselves. One witness had spoken of the acuteness of their\r\nunderstandings; another, of the extent of their memories; a third, of\r\ntheir genius for commerce: a fourth, of their proficiency in\r\nmanufactures at home. Many had admired their gentle and peaceable\r\ndisposition, their cheerfulness, and their hospitality. Even they who\r\nwere nominally slaves, in Africa lived a happy life. A witness against\r\nthe abolition had described them as sitting and eating with their\r\nmasters in the true style of patriarchal simplicity and comfort. Were\r\nthese, then, a people incapable of civilization? The argument that they\r\nwere an inferior species had been proved to be false.\r\n\r\nHe would now go to a new part of the subject. An opinion had gone forth\r\nthat the abolition of the trade would be the ruin of the West India\r\nIslands. He trusted he should prove that the direct contrary was the\r\ntruth; though, had he been unable to do this, it would have made no\r\ndifference as to his own vote. In examining, however, this opinion; he\r\nshould exclude the subject of the cultivation of new lands by fresh\r\nimportations of slaves. The impolicy of this measure, apart from its\r\ninhumanity, was indisputably clear. Let the committee consider the\r\ndreadful mortality which attended it. Let them look to the evidence of\r\nMr. Woolrich, and there see a contrast drawn between the slow, but sure,\r\nprogress of cultivation carried on in the natural way, and the attempt\r\nto force improvements, which, however flattering the prospect at first,\r\nsoon produced a load of debt, and inextricable embarrassments. He might\r\neven appeal to the statements of the West Indians themselves, who\r\nallowed that more than twenty millions were owing to the people of this\r\ncountry, to show that no system could involve them so deeply as that on\r\nwhich they had hitherto gone. But he would refer them to the accounts of\r\nMr. Irving, as contained in the evidence. Waving, then, the\r\nconsideration of this part of the subject, the opinion in question must\r\nhave arisen from a notion, that the stock of slaves, now in the islands,\r\ncould not be kept up by propagation; but that it was necessary, from\r\ntime to time, to recruit them with imported Africans. In direct\r\nrefutation of this position he should prove: First, that, in the\r\ncondition and treatment of the Negroes, there were causes sufficient to\r\nafford us reason to expect a considerable decrease, but particularly\r\nthat their increase had not been a serious object of attention:\r\nSecondly, that this decrease was in fact, notwithstanding, very\r\ntrifling; or rather, he believed, he might declare it had now actually\r\nceased: and, Thirdly, he should urge many direct and collateral facts\r\nand arguments, constituting on the whole an irresistible proof, that\r\neven a rapid increase might henceforth be expected.\r\n\r\nHe wished to treat the West Indians with all possible candour: but he\r\nwas obliged to confess, in arguing upon these points, that whatever\r\nsplendid instances there might be of kindness towards their slaves,\r\nthere were some evils of almost universal operation, which were\r\nnecessarily connected with the system of slavery. Above all, the state\r\nof degradation to which they were reduced, deserved to be noticed, as it\r\nproduced an utter inattention to them as moral agents; they were kept at\r\nwork under the whip like cattle; they were left totally ignorant of\r\nmorality and religion; there was no regular marriage among them; hence\r\npromiscuous intercourse, early prostitution, and excessive drinking,\r\nwere material causes of their decrease. With respect to the instruction\r\nof the slaves in the principles of religion, the happiest effects had\r\nresulted, particularly in Antigua, where, under the Moravians and\r\nMethodists, they had so far profited, that the planters themselves\r\nconfessed their value as property had been raised one-third by their\r\nincreased habits of regularity and industry.\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been said to the contrary, it was plainly to be\r\ninferred from the evidence that the slaves were not protected by law.\r\nColonial statutes had indeed been passed, but they were a dead letter;\r\nsince, however ill they were treated, they were not considered as having\r\na right to redress. An instance of astonishing cruelty by a Jew had been\r\nmentioned by Mr. Ross; it was but justice to say, that the man was held\r\nin detestation for it, but yet no one had ever thought of calling him to\r\na legal account. Mr. Ross conceived a master had a right to punish his\r\nslave in whatever manner he might think proper; the same was declared by\r\nnumberless other witnesses. Some instances indeed had lately occurred of\r\nconvictions. A master had wantonly cut the mouth of a child, of six\r\nmonths old, almost from ear to ear. But did not the verdict of the jury\r\nshow, that the doctrine of calling masters to an account was entirely\r\nnovel, as it only pronounced him \"Guilty, subject to the opinion of the\r\ncourt, if immoderate correction of a slave by his master be a crime\r\nindictable!\" The court determined in the affirmative; and what was the\r\npunishment of this barbarous act?--A fine of forty shillings currency,\r\nequivalent to about twenty-five shillings sterling.\r\n\r\nThe slaves were but ill off in point of medical care. Sometimes four or\r\nfive, and even eight or nine thousand of them, were under the care of\r\none medical man; which, dispersed on different and distant estates, was\r\na greater number than he could possibly attend to.\r\n\r\nIt was also in evidence that they were in general under-fed; they were\r\nsupported partly by the produce of their own provision-ground, and\r\npartly by an allowance of flour and grain from their masters. In one of\r\nthe islands, where provision-ground did not answer one year in three,\r\nthe allowance to a working Negro was but from five to nine pints of\r\ngrain per week: in Dominica, where it never failed, from six to seven\r\nquarts: in Nevis and St. Christopher's, where there was no\r\nprovision-ground, it was but eleven pints. Add to this, that it might be\r\nstill less, as the circumstances of their masters might become\r\nembarrassed, and in this case both an abridgment of their food and an\r\nincrease of their labour would follow.\r\n\r\nBut the great cause of the decrease of the slaves was in the\r\nnon-residence of the planters. Sir George Yonge, and many others, had\r\nsaid, they had seen the slaves treated in a manner which their owners\r\nwould have resented if they had known it. Mr. Orde spoke in the\r\nstrongest terms of the misconduct of managers. The fact was, that these\r\nin general sought to establish their characters by producing large crops\r\nat a small immediate expense; too little considering how far the slaves\r\nmight suffer from ill-treatment and excessive labour. The pursuit of\r\nsuch a system was a criterion for judging of their characters, as both\r\nMr. Long and Mr. Ottley had confessed.\r\n\r\nBut he must contend, in addition to this, that the object of keeping up\r\nthe stock of slaves by breeding had never been seriously attended to.\r\nFor this he might appeal both to his own witnesses and to those of his\r\nopponents, but he would only notice one fact. It was remarkable that,\r\nwhen owners and managers were asked about the produce of their estates,\r\nthey were quite at home as to the answer; but when they were asked about\r\nthe proportion of their male and female slaves, and their infants, they\r\nknew little about the matter. Even medical men were adepts in the art of\r\nplanting, but when they were asked the latter questions, as connected\r\nwith breeding and rearing, they seemed quite amazed, and could give no\r\ninformation upon the subject of them.\r\n\r\nPersons, however, of great respectability had been called as witnesses\r\nwho had not seen the treatment of the Negroes as he had now described\r\nit. He knew what was due to their characters, but yet he must enter a\r\ngeneral protest against their testimony. \"I have often,\" says Mr. Ross,\r\n\"attended both governors and admirals upon tours in the island of\r\nJamaica, but it was not likely that these should see much distress upon\r\nthese occasions. The white people and drivers would take care not to\r\nharrow up the feelings of strangers of distinction by the exercise of\r\nthe whip, or the infliction of punishments, at that particular time;\r\nand, even if there were any disgusting objects, it was natural to\r\nsuppose that they would then remove them.\" But in truth these gentlemen\r\nhad given proofs that they were under the influence of prejudice. Some\r\nof them had declared the abolition would ruin the West Indies; but this,\r\nit was obvious, must depend upon the practicability of keeping up the\r\nstock without African supplies; and yet, when they were questioned upon\r\nthis point, they knew nothing about it; hence they had formed a\r\nconclusion without premises. Their evidence, too, extended through a\r\nlong series of years; they had never seen one instance of ill-treatment\r\nin the time, and yet, in the same breath, they talked of the amended\r\nsituation of the slaves, and that they were now far better off than\r\nformerly. One of them, to whom his country owed much, stated that a\r\nmaster had been sentenced to death for the murder of his own slave; but\r\nhis recollection must have failed him, for the murder of a slave was not\r\nthen a capital crime. A respectable governor also had delivered an\r\nopinion to the same effect; but, had he looked into the statute-book of\r\nthe island, he would have found his error.\r\n\r\nIt had been said that the slaves were in a better state than the\r\npeasantry of this country; but when the question was put to Mr. Ross,\r\ndid he not answer, \"that he would not insult the latter by a\r\ncomparison!\"\r\n\r\nIt had been said again, that the Negroes were happier as slaves than\r\nthey would be if they were to be made free. But how was this\r\nreconcilable with facts? If a Negro under extraordinary circumstances\r\nhad saved money enough, did he not always purchase his release from this\r\nsituation of superior happiness by the sacrifice of his last shilling?\r\nWas it not also notorious, that the greatest reward which a master\r\nthought he could bestow upon his slave for long and faithful services\r\nwas his freedom.\r\n\r\nIt had been said again, that Negroes, when made free, never returned to\r\ntheir own country. But was not the reason obvious? If they could even\r\nreach their own homes in safety, their kindred and connexions might be\r\ndead. But would they subject themselves to be kidnapped again; to be\r\nhurried once more on board a slave-ship, and again to endure and survive\r\nthe horrors of the passage? Yet the love of their native country had\r\nbeen proved beyond a doubt; many of the witnesses had heard them talk of\r\nit in terms of the strongest affection. Acts of suicide, too, were\r\nfrequent in the islands, under the notion that these afforded them the\r\nreadiest means of getting home. Conformably with this, Captain Wilson\r\nhad maintained that the funerals, which in Africa were accompanied with\r\nlamentations and cries of sorrow, were attended, in the West Indies with\r\nevery mark of joy.\r\n\r\nHe had now, he said, made good his first proposition--that in the\r\ncondition of the slaves there were causes, which should lead us to\r\nexpect, that there would be a considerable decrease among them. This\r\ndecrease in the island of Jamaica was but trifling, or, rather, it had\r\nceased some years ago; and if there was a decrease, it was only on the\r\nimported slaves. It appeared from the privy council report, that from\r\n1698 to 1730 the decrease was three and a-half per cent.; from 1730 to\r\n1755 it was two and a-half per cent.; from 1755 to 1768 it was lessened\r\nto one and three-quarters; and from 1768 to 1788 it was not more than\r\none per cent. This last decrease was not greater than could be accounted\r\nfor from hurricanes and consequent famines, and from the number of\r\nimported Africans who perished in the seasoning. The latter was a cause\r\nof mortality, which, it was evident, would cease with the importations.\r\nThis conclusion was confirmed in part by Dr. Anderson, who, in his\r\ntestimony to the Assembly of Jamaica, affirmed that there was a\r\nconsiderable increase on the properties of the island, and particularly\r\nin the parish in which he resided.\r\n\r\nHe would now proceed to establish his second proposition, that from\r\nhenceforth a very considerable increase might be expected. This he might\r\nsupport by a close reasoning upon the preceding facts; but the testimony\r\nof his opponents furnished him with sufficient evidence. He could show,\r\nthat wherever the slaves were treated better than ordinary, there was\r\nuniformly an increase in their number. Look at the estates of Mr.\r\nWillock, Mr. Ottley, Sir Ralph Payne, and others. In short, he should\r\nweary the committee, if he were to enumerate the instances of\r\nplantations, which were stated in the evidence to have kept up their\r\nnumbers only from a little variation in their treatment. A remedy also\r\nhad been lately found for a disorder, by which vast numbers of infants\r\nhad been formerly swept away. Mr. Long, also, had laid it down, that\r\nwhenever the slaves should bear a certain proportion to the produce,\r\nthey might be expected to keep up their numbers; but this proportion\r\nthey now exceeded. The Assembly of Jamaica had given it also as their\r\nopinion, \"that when once the sexes should become nearly equal in point\r\nof number, there was no reason to suppose, that the increase of the\r\nNegroes by generation would fall short of the natural increase of the\r\nlabouring poor in Great Britain.\" But the inequality, here spoken of,\r\ncould only exist in the case of the African Negroes, of whom more males\r\nwere imported than females; and this inequality would be done away soon\r\nafter the trade should cease.\r\n\r\nBut the increase of the Negroes, where their treatment was better than\r\nordinary, was confirmed in the evidence by instances in various parts of\r\nthe world. From one end of the continent of America to the other, their\r\nincrease had been undeniably established; and this to a prodigious\r\nextent, though they had to contend with the severe cold of the winter,\r\nand in some parts with noxious exhalations in the summer. This was the\r\ncase, also, in the settlement of Bencoolen in the East Indies. It\r\nappeared from the evidence of Mr. Botham, that a number of Negroes, who\r\nhad been imported there in the same disproportion of the sexes as in\r\nWest Indian cargoes, and who lived under the same disadvantages, as in\r\nthe islands, of promiscuous intercourse and general prostitution, began,\r\nafter they had been settled a short time, annually to increase.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the West Indies.--A slave-ship had been, many years\r\nago, wrecked near St. Vincent's. The slaves on board, who escaped to the\r\nisland, were without necessaries; and, besides, were obliged to maintain\r\na war with the native Caribbs: yet they soon multiplied to an\r\nastonishing number; and, according to Mr. Ottley, they were now on the\r\nincrease. From Sir John Dalrymple's evidence it appeared that the\r\ndomestic slaves in Jamaica, who were less worked than those in the\r\nfield, increased; and from Mr. Long, that the free Blacks and Mulattoes\r\nthere increased also.\r\n\r\nBut there was an instance which militated against these facts (and the\r\nonly one in the evidence), which he would now examine. Sir Archibald\r\nCampbell had heard that the Maroons in Jamaica, in the year 1739,\r\namounted to three thousand men fit to carry arms. This supposed their\r\nwhole number to have been about twelve thousand; but in the year 1782,\r\nafter a real muster by himself, he found, to his great astonishment,\r\nthat the fighting men did not then amount to three hundred. Now the fact\r\nwas, that Sir Archibald Campbell's first position was founded upon\r\nrumour only, and was not true; for, according to Mr. Long, the Maroons\r\nwere actually numbered in 1749, when they amounted to about six hundred\r\nand sixty in all, having only a hundred and fifty men fit to carry arms.\r\nHence, if when mustered by Sir Archibald Campbell he found three hundred\r\nfighting men, they must from 1749 to 1782 have actually doubled their\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nWas it possible, after these instances, to suppose that the Negroes\r\ncould not keep up their numbers, if their natural increase were made a\r\nsubject of attention? The reverse was proved by sound reasoning. It had\r\nbeen confirmed by unquestionable facts. It had been shown, that they had\r\nincreased in every situation, where there was the slightest circumstance\r\nin their favour. Where there had been any decrease, it was stated to be\r\ntrifling; though no attention appeared to have been paid to the subject.\r\nThis decrease had been gradually lessening; and, whenever a single cause\r\nof it had been removed (many still remaining), it had altogether ceased.\r\nSurely these circumstances formed a body of proof which was\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nHe would now speak of the consequences of the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade in other points of view; and first, as to its effects upon our\r\nmarine. An abstract of the Bristol and Liverpool muster-rolls had been\r\njust laid before the House. It appeared from this, that in three hundred\r\nand fifty slave-vessels, having on board twelve thousand two hundred and\r\nsixty-three persons, two thousand six hundred and forty-three were lost\r\nin twelve months; whereas in four hundred and sixty-two West Indiamen,\r\nhaving on board seven thousand six hundred and forty persons, one\r\nhundred and eighteen only were lost in seven months. This rather\r\nexceeded the losses stated by Mr. Clarkson. For their barbarous usage on\r\nboard these ships, and for their sickly and abject state in the West\r\nIndies, he would appeal to Governor Parry's letter; to the evidence of\r\nMr. Ross; to the assertion of Mr. B. Edwards, an opponent; and to the\r\ntestimony of Captains Sir George Yonge and Thompson, of the Royal Navy.\r\nHe would appeal, also, to what Captain Hall, of the Navy, had given in\r\nevidence. This gentleman, after the action of the 12th of April,\r\nimpressed thirty hands from a slave-vessel, whom he selected with the\r\nutmost care from a crew of seventy; and he was reprimanded by his\r\nadmiral, though they could scarcely get men to bring home the prizes,\r\nfor introducing such wretches to communicate disorders to the fleet.\r\nCaptain Smith of the Navy had also declared, that when employed to board\r\nGuineamen to impress sailors, although he had examined near twenty\r\nvessels, he never was able to get more than two men, who were fit for\r\nservice; and these turned out such inhuman fellows, although good\r\nseamen, that he was obliged to dismiss them from the ship.\r\n\r\nBut he hoped the committee would attend to the latter part of the\r\nassertion of Captain Smith. Yes: this trade, while it injured the\r\nconstitutions of our sailors, debased their morals. Of this, indeed,\r\nthere was a barbarous illustration in the evidence. A slave-ship had\r\nstruck on some shoals, called the Morant Keys, a few leagues from the\r\neast end of Jamaica. The crew landed in their boats, with arms and\r\nprovisions, leaving the slaves on board in their irons. This happened in\r\nthe night. When morning came, it was discovered that the Negroes had\r\nbroken their shackles, and were busy in making rafts; upon which\r\nafterwards they placed the women and children. The men attended upon the\r\nlatter, swimming by their side, whilst they drifted to the island where\r\nthe crew were. But what was the sequel? From an apprehension that the\r\nNegroes would consume the water and provisions, which had been landed,\r\nthe crew resolved to destroy them as they approached the shore. They\r\nkilled between three and four hundred. Out of the whole cargo only\r\nthirty-three were saved, who, on being brought to Kingston, were sold.\r\nIt would, however, be to no purpose, he said, to relieve the Slave Trade\r\nfrom this act of barbarity. The story of the Morant Keys was paralleled\r\nby that of Captain Collingwood; and were you to get rid of these,\r\nanother, and another, would still present itself, to prove the barbarous\r\neffects of this trade on the moral character.\r\n\r\nBut of the miseries of the trade there was no end. Whilst he had been\r\nreading out of the evidence the story of the Morant Keys, his eye had\r\nbut glanced on the opposite page, and it met another circumstance of\r\nhorror. This related to what were called the refuse-slaves. Many people\r\nin Kingston were accustomed to speculate in the purchase of those, who\r\nwere left after the first day's sale. They then carried them out into\r\nthe country, and retailed them. Mr. Ross declared, that he had seen\r\nthese landed in a very wretched state, sometimes in the agonies of\r\ndeath, and sold as low as for a dollar, and that he had known several\r\nexpire in the piazzas of the vendue-master. The bare description\r\nsuperseded the necessity of any remark. Yet these were the familiar\r\nincidents of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nBut he would go back to the seamen. He would mention another cause of\r\nmortality, by which many of them lost their lives. In looking over\r\nLloyd's list, no less than six vessels were cut off by the irritated\r\nnatives in one year, and the crews massacred. Such instances were not\r\nunfrequent. In short, the history of this commerce was written\r\nthroughout in characters of blood.\r\n\r\nHe would next consider the effects of the abolition on those places\r\nwhere it was chiefly carried on. But would the committee believe, after\r\nall the noise which had been made on this subject, that the Slave Trade\r\ncomposed but a thirtieth part of the export trade of Liverpool, and that\r\nof the trade of Bristol it constituted a still less proportion? For the\r\neffects of the abolition on the general commerce of the kingdom, he\r\nwould refer them to Mr. Irving; from whose evidence it would appear,\r\nthat the medium value of the British manufactures, exported to Africa,\r\namounted only to between four and five hundred thousand pounds annually.\r\nThis was but a trifling sum. Surely the superior capital, ingenuity,\r\napplication, and integrity of the British manufacturer would command new\r\nmarkets for the produce of his industry, to an equal amount, when this\r\nshould be no more. One branch, however, of our manufactures, he\r\nconfessed, would suffer from the abolition; and that was the manufacture\r\nof gunpowder; of which the nature of our connexion with Africa drew from\r\nus as much as we exported to all the rest of the world besides.\r\n\r\nHe hastened, however, to another part of the argument. Some had said,\r\n\"We wish to put an end to the Slave Trade, but we do not approve of your\r\nmode. Allow more time. Do not displease the legislatures of the West\r\nIndia islands. It is by them that those laws must be passed, and\r\nenforced, which will secure your object.\" Now he was directly at issue\r\nwith these gentlemen. He could show, that the abolition was the only\r\ncertain mode of amending the treatment of the slaves, so as to secure\r\ntheir increase: and that the mode which had been offered to him, was at\r\nonce inefficacious and unsafe. In the first place, how could any laws,\r\nmade by these legislatures, be effectual, whilst the evidence of Negroes\r\nwas in no case admitted against White men? What was the answer from\r\nGrenada? Did it not state, \"that they who were capable of cruelty, would\r\nin general be artful enough to prevent any but slaves from being\r\nwitnesses of the fact?\" Hence it had arisen, that when positive laws had\r\nbeen made, in some of the islands, for the protection of the slaves,\r\nthey had been found almost a dead letter. Besides, by what law would you\r\nenter into every man's domestic concerns, and regulate the interior\r\neconomy of his house and plantation? This would be something more than a\r\ngeneral excise. Who would endure such a law? And yet on all these and\r\ninnumerable other minutiae must depend the protection of the slaves,\r\ntheir comforts, and the probability of their increase. It was\r\nuniversally allowed, that the Code Noir had been utterly neglected in\r\nthe French islands, though there was an officer appointed by the crown\r\nto see it enforced. The provisions of the Directorio had been but of\r\nlittle more avail in the Portuguese settlements, or the institution of a\r\nProtector of the Indians, in those of the Spaniards. But what degree or\r\nprotection the slaves would enjoy might be inferred from the admission\r\nof a gentleman, by whom this very plan of regulation had been\r\nrecommended, and who was himself no ordinary person, but a man of\r\ndiscernment and legal resources. He had proposed a limitation of the\r\nnumber of lashes to be given by the master or overseer for one offence.\r\nBut, after all, he candidly confessed, that his proposal was not likely\r\nto be useful, while the evidence of slaves continued inadmissible\r\nagainst their masters. But he could even bring testimony to the\r\ninefficacy of such regulations. A wretch in Barbados had chained a Negro\r\ngirl to the floor, and flogged her till she was nearly expiring. Captain\r\nCook and Major Fitch, hearing her cries, broke open the door and found\r\nher. The wretch retreated from their resentment, but cried out\r\nexultingly, \"that he had only given her thirty-nine lashes (the number\r\nlimited by law) at any one time; and that he had only inflicted this\r\nnumber three times since the beginning of the night,\" adding, \"that he\r\nwould prosecute them for breaking open his door; and that he would flog\r\nher to death for all any one, if he pleased; and that he would give her\r\nthe fourth thirty-nine before morning.\"\r\n\r\nBut this plan of regulation was not only inefficacious, but unsafe. He\r\nentered his protest against the fatal consequences which might result\r\nfrom it. The Negroes were creatures like ourselves; but they were\r\nuninformed, and their moral character was debased. Hence they were unfit\r\nfor civil rights. To use these properly they must be gradually restored\r\nto that level, from which they had been so unjustly degraded. To allow\r\nthem an appeal to the laws, would be to awaken in them a sense of the\r\ndignity of their nature. The first return of life, after a swoon, was\r\ncommonly a convulsion, dangerous at once to the party himself and to all\r\naround him. You should first prepare them for the situation, and not\r\nbring the situation to them. To be under the protection of the law was\r\nin fact to be a freeman; and to unite slavery and freedom in one\r\ncondition was impracticable. The abolition, on the other hand, was\r\nexactly such an agent as the case required. All hopes of supplies from\r\nthe coast being cut off, breeding would henceforth become a serious\r\nobject of attention; and the care of this, as including better clothing,\r\nand feeding, and milder discipline, would extend to innumerable\r\nparticulars, which an act of assembly could neither specify nor enforce.\r\nThe horrible system, too, which many had gone upon, of working out their\r\nslaves in a few years, and recruiting their gangs with imported\r\nAfricans, would receive its death-blow from the abolition of the trade.\r\nThe opposite would force itself on the most unfeeling heart. Ruin would\r\nstare a man in the face, if he were not to conform to it. The\r\nnon-resident owners would then express themselves in the terms of Sir\r\nPhilip Gibbs, \"that he should consider it as the fault of his manager,\r\nif he were not to keep up the number of his slaves.\" This reasoning\r\nconcerning the different tendencies of the two systems was self-evident;\r\nbut facts were not wanting to confirm it. Mr. Long had remarked, that\r\nall the insurrections and suicides in Jamaica had been found among the\r\nimported slaves, who, not having lost the consciousness of civil rights,\r\nwhich they had enjoyed in their own country, could not brook the\r\nindignities to which they were subjected in the West Indies. An instance\r\nin point was afforded also by what had lately taken place in the island\r\nof Dominica. The disturbance there had been chiefly occasioned by some\r\nrunaway slaves from the French islands. But what an illustration was it\r\nof his own doctrine to say, that the slaves of several persons, who had\r\nbeen treated with kindness, were not among the number of the insurgents\r\non that occasion!\r\n\r\nBut when persons coolly talked of putting an end to the Slave Trade\r\nthrough the medium of the West India legislatures, and of gradual\r\nabolition, by means of regulations, they surely forgot the miseries\r\nwhich this horrid traffic occasioned in Africa during every moment of\r\nits continuance. This consideration was conclusive with him, when called\r\nupon to decide whether the Slave Trade should be tolerated for a while,\r\nor immediately abolished. The divine law against murder was absolute and\r\nunqualified. Whilst we were ignorant of all these things, our sanction\r\nof them might, in some measure, be pardoned. But now, when our eyes were\r\nopened, could we tolerate them for a moment, unless we were ready at\r\nonce to determine, that gain should be our god, and, like the heathens\r\nof old, were prepared to offer up human victims at the shrine of our\r\nidolatry?\r\n\r\nThis consideration precluded also the giving heed for an instant to\r\nanother plea, namely, that if we were to abolish the trade it would be\r\nproportionably taken up by other nations.  But, whatever other nations\r\ndid, it became Great Britain, in every point of view, to take a forward\r\npart. One half of this guilty commerce had been carried on by her\r\nsubjects. As we had been great in crime we should be early in our\r\nrepentance. If Providence had showered his blessings upon us in\r\nunparalleled abundance, we should show ourselves grateful for them by\r\nrendering them subservient to the purposes for which they were intended.\r\nThere would be a day of retribution, wherein we should have to give an\r\naccount of all those talents, faculties, and opportunities with which we\r\nhave been intrusted. Let it not then appear that our superior power had\r\nbeen employed to oppress our fellow-creatures, and our superior light to\r\ndarken the creation of God. He could not but look forward with delight\r\nto the happy prospects which opened themselves to his view in Africa,\r\nfrom the abolition of the Slave Trade, when a commerce, justly deserving\r\nthat name, should be established with her; not like that, falsely so\r\ncalled, which now subsisted, and which all who were interested for the\r\nhonour of the commercial character (though there were no superior\r\nprinciple) should hasten to disavow. Had this trade indeed been ever so\r\nprofitable, his decision would have been in no degree affected by that\r\nconsideration. \"Here's the smell of blood on the hand still, and all the\r\nperfumes of Arabia cannot sweeten it.\"\r\n\r\nHe doubted whether it was not almost an act of degrading condescension\r\nto stoop to discuss the question in the view of commercial interest. On\r\nthis ground, however, he was no less strong than on every other. Africa\r\nabounded with productions of value, which she would gladly exchange for\r\nour manufactures, when these were not otherwise to be obtained: and to\r\nwhat an extent her demand might then grow, exceeded almost the powers of\r\ncomputation. One instance already existed of a native king, who being\r\ndebarred by his religion the use of spirituous liquors, and therefore\r\nnot feeling the irresistible temptation to acts of rapine which they\r\nafforded to his countrymen, had abolished the Slave Trade throughout all\r\nhis dominions, and was encouraging an honest industry.\r\n\r\nFor his own part, he declared that, interested as he might be supposed\r\nto be in the final event of the question, he was comparatively\r\nindifferent as to the present decision of the House upon it. Whatever\r\nthey might do, the people of Great Britain, he was confident, would\r\nabolish the Slave Trade when, as would then soon happen, its injustice\r\nand cruelty should be fairly laid before them. It was a nest of\r\nserpents, which would never have existed so long but for the darkness in\r\nwhich they lay hid. The light of day would now be let in on them, and\r\nthey would vanish from the sight. For himself, he declared he was\r\nengaged in a work which he would never abandon; the consciousness of the\r\njustice of his cause would carry him forward, though he were alone; but\r\nhe could not but derive encouragement from considering with whom he was\r\nassociated. Let us not, he said, despair; it is a blessed cause, and\r\nsuccess ere long will crown our exertions. Already we have gained one\r\nvictory; we have obtained for these poor creatures the recognition of\r\ntheir human nature[A], which, for a while, was most shamefully denied\r\nthem. This is the first fruits of our efforts; let us persevere, and our\r\ntriumph will be complete. Never, never, will we desist till we have\r\nwiped away this scandal from the Christian name; till we have released\r\nourselves from the load of guilt under which we at present labour; and\r\ntill we have extinguished every trace of this bloody traffic, which our\r\nposterity, looking back to the history of these enlightened times, will\r\nscarcely believe had been suffered to exist so long, a disgrace and a\r\ndishonour to our country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: This point was actually obtained by the evidence before the\r\nHouse of Commons; for, after this, we heard no more of them as an\r\ninferior race.]\r\n\r\nHe then moved, that the chairman be instructed to move for leave to\r\nbring in a bill to prevent the further importation of slaves into the\r\nBritish colonies in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nColonel Tarleton immediately rose up, and began by giving an historical\r\naccount of the trade from the reign of Elizabeth to the present time. He\r\nthen proceeded to the sanction which parliament had always given it;\r\nhence it could not then be withdrawn without a breach of faith: hence,\r\nalso, the private property embarked in it was sacred; nor could it be\r\ninvaded, unless an adequate compensation were given in return.\r\n\r\nThey who had attempted the abolition of the trade were led away by a\r\nmistaken humanity; the Africans themselves had no objection to its\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the middle passage, he believed the mortality there to\r\nbe on an average only five in the hundred; whereas in regiments sent out\r\nto the West Indies, the average loss in the year was about ten and a\r\nhalf per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Slave Trade was absolutely necessary, if we meant to carry on our\r\nWest India commerce; for many attempts had been made to cultivate the\r\nlands in the different islands by white labourers, but they had always\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nIt had also the merit of keeping up a number of seamen in readiness for\r\nthe state. Lord Rodney had stated this as one of its advantages on the\r\nbreaking out of a war. Liverpool alone could supply nine hundred and\r\nninety-three seamen annually.\r\n\r\nHe would now advert to the connexions dependent upon the African trade.\r\nIt was the duty of the House to protect the planters, whose lives had\r\nbeen, and were then, exposed to imminent, dangers, and whose property\r\nhad undergone an unmerited, depreciation. To what could this\r\ndepreciation, and to what could the late insurrection at Dominica be\r\nimputed, which had been saved from horrid carnage and midnight-butchery\r\nonly by the adventitious arrival of two British regiments? They could\r\nonly be attributed to the long delayed question of the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade; and if this question were to go much longer unsettled,\r\nJamaica would be endangered also.\r\n\r\nTo members of landed property he would observe, that the abolition would\r\nlessen the commerce of the country, and increase the national debt and\r\nthe number of their taxes. The minister, he hoped, who patronized this\r\nwild scheme had some new pecuniary resource in store to supply the\r\ndeficiencies it would occasion.\r\n\r\nTo the mercantile members he would speak thus: \"A few ministerial men in\r\nthe house had been gifted with religious inspiration, and this had been\r\ncommunicated to other eminent personages in it: these enlightened\r\nphilanthropists had discovered that it was necessary, for the sake of\r\nhumanity, and for the honour of the nation, that the merchants concerned\r\nin the African trade should be persecuted, notwithstanding the sanction\r\nof their trade by Parliament, and notwithstanding that such persecution\r\nmust aggrandize the rivals of Great Britain.\" Now how did this language\r\nsound? It might have done in the twelfth century, when all was bigotry\r\nand superstition; but let not a mistaken humanity, in these enlightened\r\ntimes, furnish a colourable pretext for any injurious attack on property\r\nor character.\r\n\r\nThese things being considered, he should certainly oppose the measure in\r\ncontemplation. It would annihilate a trade, whose exports amounted to\r\neight hundred thousand pounds annually, and which employed a hundred and\r\nsixty vessels, and more than five thousand seamen. It would destroy also\r\nthe West India trade, which was of the annual value of six millions; and\r\nwhich employed one hundred and sixty thousand tons of shipping, and\r\nseamen in proportion. These were objects of too much importance to the\r\ncountry to be hazarded on an unnecessary speculation.\r\n\r\nMr. Grosvenor then rose. He complimented the humanity of Mr.\r\nWilberforce, though he differed from him on the subject of his motion.\r\nHe himself had read only the privy council report, and he wished for no\r\nother evidence. The question had then been delayed two years; had the\r\nabolition been so clear a point as it was said to be, it could not have\r\nneeded either so much evidence or time.\r\n\r\nHe had heard a good deal about kidnapping, and other barbarous\r\npractices. He was sorry for them. But these were the natural\r\nconsequences of the laws of Africa; and it became us as wise men to turn\r\nthem to our own advantage. The Slave Trade was certainly not an amiable\r\ntrade. Neither was that of a butcher; but yet it was a very necessary\r\none.\r\n\r\nThere was great reason to doubt the propriety of the present motion. He\r\nhad twenty reasons for disapproving it. The first was, that the thing\r\nwas impossible. He needed not, therefore to give the rest. Parliament,\r\nindeed might relinquish the trade. But to whom? To foreigners, who would\r\ncontinue it, and without the humane regulations which were applied to it\r\nby his countrymen.\r\n\r\nHe would give advice to the House on this subject, in the words which\r\nthe late Alderman Beckford used a different occasion:--\"Meddle, not with\r\ntroubled waters; they will be found to be bitter waters; and the waters\r\nof affliction.\" He again admitted, that the Slave Trade was not an\r\namiable trade; but he would not gratify his humanity at the expense of\r\nthe interests of his country; and he thought we should not too curiously\r\ninquire into the unpleasant circumstances which attended it.\r\n\r\nMr. James Martin succeeded Mr. Grosvenor. He said he had been long aware\r\nhow much self-interest could pervert the judgment; but he was not\r\napprized of the full power of it, till the Slave Trade became a subject\r\nof discussion. He had always conceived that the custom of trafficing in\r\nhuman beings had been incautiously begun, and without any reflection\r\nupon it; for he never could believe that any man, under the influence of\r\nmoral principles, could suffer himself knowingly to carry on a trade\r\nreplete with fraud, cruelty, and destruction; with destruction indeed,\r\nof the worst kind, because it subjected the sufferers to a lingering\r\ndeath. But he found now, that even such a trade as this could be\r\nsanctioned.\r\n\r\nIt was well observed, in the petition from the University of Cambridge\r\nagainst the Slave Trade, \"that a firm belief in the providence of a\r\nbenevolent Creator assured them that no system, founded on the\r\noppression of one part of mankind, could be beneficial to another.\" He\r\nfelt much concern, that in an assembly of the representatives of the\r\ncountry, boasting itself zealous, not only for the preservation of its\r\nown liberties, but for the general rights of mankind, it should be\r\nnecessary to say a single word upon such a subject; but the\r\ndeceitfulness of the human heart was such, as to change the appearances\r\nof truth, when it stood in opposition to self-interests. And he had to\r\nlament that even among those, whose public duty it was to cling to the\r\nuniversal and eternal principles of truth, justice, and humanity, there\r\nwere found some who could defend that which was unjust, fraudulent, and\r\ncruel.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines he had heard that evening ought to have been reserved for\r\ntimes the most flagrantly profligate and abandoned. He never expected\r\nthen to learn that the everlasting laws of righteousness were to give\r\nway to imaginary, political, and commercial expediency; and that\r\nthousands of our fellow-creatures were to be reduced to wretchedness,\r\nthat individuals might enjoy opulence, or government a revenue.\r\n\r\nHe hoped that the House, for the sake of its own character, would\r\nexplode these doctrines with all the marks of odium they deserved; and\r\nthat all parties would join in giving a death-blow to this execrable\r\ntrade. The royal family would, he expected, from their known\r\nbenevolence, patronize the measure. Both Houses of Parliament were now\r\nengaged in the prosecution of a gentleman accused of cruelty and\r\noppression in the East. But what were these cruelties, even if they\r\ncould be brought home to him, when compared in number and degree to\r\nthose which were every day and every hour committed in the abominable\r\ntraffic which was now under their discussion! He considered, therefore,\r\nboth Houses of Parliament as pledged upon this occasion. Of the support\r\nof the bishops he could have no doubt; because they were to render\r\nChristianity amiable, both by their doctrine and their example. Some of\r\nthe inferior clergy had already manifested a laudable zeal in behalf of\r\nthe injured Africans. The University of Cambridge had presented a\r\npetition to that House worthy of itself. The sister-university had, by\r\none of her representatives, given sanction to the measure. Dissenters of\r\nvarious denominations, but particularly the Quakers, (who, to their\r\nimmortal honour, had taken the lead in it,) had vied with those of the\r\nEstablished Church in this amiable contest. The first counties, and some\r\nof the largest trading towns, in the kingdom had espoused the cause. In\r\nshort, there had never been more unanimity in the country, than in this\r\nrighteous attempt.\r\n\r\nWith such support, and with so good a cause, it would be impossible to\r\nfail. Let but every man stand forth who had at any time boasted of\r\nhimself as an Englishman, and success would follow. But if he were to be\r\nunhappily mistaken as to the result, we must give up the name of\r\nEnglishmen. Indeed, if we retained it, we should be the greatest\r\nhypocrites in the world; for we boasted of nothing more than of our own\r\nliberty; we manifested the warmest indignation at the smallest personal\r\ninsult; we professed liberal sentiments towards other nations: but to do\r\nthese things, and to continue such a traffic, would be to deserve the\r\nhateful character before mentioned. While we could hardly bear the sight\r\nof anything resembling slavery, even as a punishment, among ourselves,\r\nhow could we consistently entail an eternal slavery upon others?\r\n\r\nIt had been frequently, but most disgracefully, said, that \"we should\r\nnot be too eager in setting the example: let the French begin it.\" Such\r\na sentiment was a direct libel upon the ancient, noble, and generous\r\ncharacter of this nation. We ought, on the other hand, under the\r\nblessings we enjoyed, and under the high sense we entertained of our own\r\ndignity as a people, to be proudly fearful, lest other nations should\r\nanticipate our design, and obtain the palm before us. It became us to\r\nlead. And if others should not follow us, it would belong to them to\r\nglory in the shame of trampling under foot the laws of reason, humanity,\r\nand religion.\r\n\r\nThis motion, he said, came strongly recommended to them. The honourable\r\nmember who introduced it was justly esteemed for his character. He was\r\nthe representative, too of a noble county, which had been always ready\r\nto take the lead in every public measure for the good of the community,\r\nor for the general benefit of mankind; of a county, too, which had had\r\nthe honour of producing a Saville. Had his illustrious predecessor been\r\nalive, he would have shown the same zeal on the same occasion. The\r\npreservation of the unalienable rights of all his fellow-creatures was\r\none of the chief characteristics of that excellent citizen. Let every\r\nmember in that House imitate him in the purity of their conduct and in\r\nthe universal rectitude of their measures, and they would pay the same\r\ntender regard to the rights of other countries as to those of their own;\r\nand, for his part, he should never believe those persons to be sincere\r\nwho were loud in their professions of love of liberty, if he saw that\r\nlove confined to the narrow circle of one community, which ought to be\r\nextended to the natural rights of every inhabitant of the globe.\r\n\r\nBut we should be better able to bring ourselves up to this standard of\r\nrectitude, if we were to put ourselves into the situation of those whom\r\nwe oppressed. This was the rule of our religion. What should we think of\r\nthose who should say, that it was their interest to injure us?  But he\r\nhoped we should not deceive ourselves so grossly as to imagine that it\r\nwas our real interest to oppress any one. The advantages to be obtained\r\nby tyranny were imaginary, and deceitful to the tyrant; and the evils\r\nthey caused to the oppressed were grievous, and often insupportable.\r\n\r\nBefore he sat down, he would apologize if he had expressed himself too\r\nwarmly on this subject. He did not mean to offend any one. There were\r\npersons connected with the trade, some of whom he pitied on account of\r\nthe difficulty of their situation. But he should think most contemptibly\r\nof himself as a man if he could talk on this traffic without emotion. It\r\nwould be a sign to him of his own moral degradation. He regretted his\r\ninability to do justice to such a cause; but if, in having attempted to\r\nforward it, he had shown the weakness of his powers, he must console\r\nhimself with the consideration, that he felt more solid comfort in\r\nhaving acted up to sound public principles, than he could have done from\r\nthe exercise of the most splendid talents, against the conviction of his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nMr. Burdon rose, and said he was embarrassed to know how to act. Mr.\r\nWilberforce had in a great measure met his ideas. Indeed he considered\r\nhimself as much in his hands; but he wished to go gradually to the\r\nabolition of the trade. He wished to give time to the planters to\r\nrecruit their stocks. He feared the immediate abolition might occasion a\r\nmonopoly among such of them as were rich, to the detriment of the less\r\naffluent. We ought, like a judicious physician, to follow nature, and to\r\npromote a gradual recovery.\r\n\r\nMr. Francis rose next. After complimenting Mr. Wilberforce, he stated\r\nthat personal considerations might appear to incline him to go against\r\nthe side which he was about to take, namely, that of strenuously\r\nsupporting his motion. Having himself an interest in the West Indies, he\r\nthought that what he should submit to the House would have the double\r\neffect of evidence, and argument; and he stated most unequivocally his\r\nopinion, that the abolition of the Slave Trade would tend materially to\r\nthe benefit of the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe arguments urged by the honourable mover were supported by the facts,\r\nwhich he had adduced from the evidence, more strongly than any arguments\r\nhad been supported in any speech he had ever heard. He wished, however,\r\nthat more of these facts had been introduced into the debate; for they\r\nwere apt to have a greater effect upon the mind than mere reasonings,\r\nhowever just and powerful. Many had affirmed that the Slave Trade was\r\npolitic and expedient; but it was worthy of remark, that no man had\r\nventured to deny that it was criminal. Criminal, however, he declared it\r\nto be in the highest degree; and he believed it was equally impolitic.\r\nBoth its inexpediency and injustice had been established by the\r\nhonourable mover. He dwelt much on the unhappy situation of the negroes\r\nin the West Indies, who were without the protection of government or of\r\nefficient laws, and subject to the mere caprice of men, who were at once\r\nthe parties, the judges, and the executioners.\r\n\r\nHe instanced an overseer, who, having thrown a negro into a copper of\r\nboiling cane-juice, for a trifling offence, was punished merely by the\r\nloss of his place, and by being obliged to pay the value of the slave.\r\nHe stated another instance of a girl of fourteen, who was dreadfully\r\nwhipped for coming too late to her work. She fell down motionless after\r\nit; and was then dragged along the ground, by the legs, to an hospital;\r\nwhere she died. The murderer, though tried, was acquitted by a jury of\r\nhis peers, upon the idea, that it was impossible a master could destroy\r\nhis own property. This was a notorious fact. It was published in the\r\n_Jamaica Gazette;_ and it had even happened since the question of the\r\nabolition had been started.\r\n\r\nThe only argument used against such cruelties, was the master's interest\r\nin the slave; but he urged the common cruelty to horses, in which their\r\ndrivers had an equal interest with the drivers of men in the colonies,\r\nas a proof that this was no security. He had never heard an instance of\r\na master being punished for the murder of his slave. The propagation of\r\nthe slaves was so far from being encouraged, that it was purposely\r\nchecked, because it was thought more profitable and less troublesome to\r\nbuy a full grown negro, than to rear a child. He repeated that his\r\ninterest might have inclined him to the other side of the question; but\r\nhe did not choose to compromise between his interest and his duty; for,\r\nif he abandoned his duty, he should not be happy in this world; nor\r\nshould he deserve happiness in the next.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt rose; but he said it was only to move, seeing that justice\r\ncould not be done to the subject this evening, that the further\r\nconsideration of the question might be adjourned to the next.\r\n\r\nMr. Cawthorne and Colonel Tarleton both opposed this motion, and Colonel\r\nPhipps and Lord Carhampton supported it.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox said, the opposition to the adjournment was uncandid and\r\nunbecoming. They who opposed it well knew that the trade could not bear\r\ndiscussion. Let it be discussed; and, although there were symptoms of\r\npredetermination in some, the abolition of it must be carried. He would\r\nnot believe that there could be found in the House of Commons men of\r\nsuch hard hearts and inaccessible understandings, as to vote an assent\r\nto its continuance, and then go home to their families, satisfied with\r\ntheir vote, after they had been once made acquainted with the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt agreed with Mr. Fox, that from a full discussion of the subject\r\nthere was every reason to augur that the abolition would be adopted.\r\nUnder the imputations, with which this trade was loaded, gentlemen\r\nshould remember, they could not do justice to their own characters,\r\nunless they stood up, and gave their reasons for opposing the abolition\r\nof it. It was unusual also to force any question of such importance to\r\nso hasty a decision. For his own part, it was his duty, from the\r\nsituation in which he stood, to state fully his own sentiments on the\r\nquestion; and, however exhausted both he and the House might be, he was\r\nresolved it should not pass without discussion, as long as he had\r\nstrength to utter a word upon it. Every principle that could bind a man\r\nof honour and conscience, would impel him to give the most powerful\r\nsupport he could to the motion for the abolition.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. Pitt was assented to, and the House was adjourned\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nOn the next day the subject was resumed. Sir William Yonge rose, and\r\nsaid, that, though he differed from the honourable mover, he had much\r\nadmired his speech of the last evening. Indeed the recollection of it\r\nmade him only the more sensible of the weakness of his own powers; and\r\nyet, having what he supposed to be irrefragable arguments in his\r\npossession, he felt emboldened to proceed.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, before he could vote for the abolition, he wished to be\r\nconvinced, that, whilst Britain were to lose, Africa would gain. As for\r\nhimself, he hated a traffic in men, and joyfully anticipated its\r\ntermination at no distant period under a wise system of regulation: but\r\nhe considered the present measure as crude and indolent; and as\r\nprecluding better and wiser measures, which were already in train. A\r\nBritish Parliament should attain not only the best ends, but by the\r\nwisest means.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain might abandon her share of this trade, but she could not\r\nabolish it. Parliament was not an assembly of delegates from the powers\r\nof Europe, but of a single nation. It could not therefore suppress the\r\ntrade; but would eventually aggravate those miseries incident to it,\r\nwhich every enlightened man must acknowledge, and every good man must\r\ndeplore. He wished the traffic for ever closed. But other nations were\r\nonly waiting for our decision, to seize the part we should leave them.\r\nThe new projects of these would be intemperate; and, in the zeal of\r\nrivalship, the present evils of comparatively sober dealing would be\r\naggravated beyond all estimate in this new and heated auction of bidders\r\nfor life and limb. We might, indeed, by regulation give an example of\r\nnew principles of policy and of justice; but if we were to withdraw\r\nsuddenly from this commerce, like Pontius Pilate, we should wash our\r\nhands, indeed, but we should not be innocent as to the consequences.\r\n\r\nOn the first agitation of this business, Mr. Wilberforce had spoken\r\nconfidently of other nations following our example. But had not the\r\nNational Assembly of France referred the Slave Trade to a select\r\ncommittee, and had not that committee rejected the measure of its\r\nabolition? By the evidence it appeared, that the French and Spaniards\r\nwere then giving bounties to the Slave Trade; that Denmark was desirous\r\nof following it; that America was encouraging it; and that the Dutch had\r\nrecognized its necessity, and recommended its recovery. Things were bad\r\nenough indeed as they were, but he was sure this rivalship would make\r\nthem worse.\r\n\r\nHe did not admit the disorders imputed to the trade in all their extent.\r\nPillage and kidnapping could not be general, on account of the\r\npopulousness of the country; though too frequent instances of it had\r\nbeen proved. Crimes might be falsely imputed. This he admitted; but only\r\npartially. Witchcraft, he believed, was the secret of poisoning, and\r\ntherefore deserved the severest punishment. That there should be a\r\nnumber of convictions for adultery, where polygamy was a custom, was not\r\nto be wondered at; but he feared, if a sale of these criminals were to\r\nbe done away, massacre would be the substitute.\r\n\r\nAn honourable member had asked on a former day, \"Is it an excuse for\r\nrobbery to say that another would hare committed it?\" But the Slave\r\nTrade did not necessarily imply robbery. Not long since Great Britain\r\nsold her convicts, indirectly at least, to slavery; but he was no\r\nadvocate for the trade. He wished it had begun, and that it might soon\r\nterminate. But the means were not adequate to the end proposed.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke had said on a former occasion, \"that in adopting measure we\r\nmust prepare to pay the price of our virtue.\" He was ready to pay his\r\nshare of that price; but the effect of the purchase must be first\r\nascertained. If they did not estimate this, it was not benevolence, but\r\ndissipation. Effects were to be duly appreciated; and though statesmen\r\nmight rest everything on a manifesto of causes, the humbler moralist,\r\nmeditating peace and good will towards men, would venture to call such\r\nstatesmen responsible for consequences.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the colonies, a sudden abolition would be oppression. The\r\nlegislatures there should be led, and not forced, upon this occasion. He\r\nwas persuaded they would act wisely to attain the end pointed out to\r\nthem. They would see that a natural increase of their negroes might be\r\neffected by an improved system of legislation; and that in the result\r\nthe Slave Trade would be no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nA sudden abolition, also, would occasion dissatisfaction there. Supplies\r\nwere necessary for some time to come. The negroes did not yet generally\r\nincrease by birth. The gradation of ages was not yet duly filled. These\r\nand many defects might be remedied, but not suddenly.\r\n\r\nIt would cause, also, distress there. The planters, not having their\r\nexpected supplies, could not discharge their debts; hence their slaves\r\nwould be seized and sold. Nor was there any provision in this case\r\nagainst the separation of families, except as to the mother and infant\r\nchild. These separations were one of the chief outrages complained of in\r\nAfrica. Why, then, should we promote them in the West Indies? The\r\nconfinement on board a slave-ship had been also bitterly complained of;\r\nbut, under distraint for the debt of a master, the poor slave might\r\nlinger in a gaol twice or thrice the time of the Middle Passage.\r\n\r\nHe again stated his abhorrence of the Slave Trade; but as a resource,\r\nthough he hoped but a temporary one, it was of such consequence to the\r\nexistence of the country, that it could not suddenly be withdrawn. The\r\nvalue, of the imports and exports between Great Britain and the West\r\nIndies, including the excise and customs, was between seven and eight\r\nmillions annually; and the tonnage of the ships employed about an eighth\r\nof the whole tonnage of these kingdoms.\r\n\r\nHe complained that in the evidence the West Indian planters had been by\r\nno means spared. Cruel stories had been hastily and lightly told against\r\nthem. Invidious comparisons had been made to their detriment; but it was\r\nwell known that one of our best comic writers, when he wished to show\r\nbenevolence in its fairest colours, had personified it in the character\r\nof the West Indian. He wished the slave might become as secure as the\r\napprentice in this country; but it was necessary that the alarms\r\nconcerning the abolition of the Slave Trade should, in the mean time, be\r\nquieted; and he trusted that the good sense and true benevolence of the\r\nHouse would reject the present motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Matthew Montagu rose and said a few words in support of the motion;\r\nand after condemning the trade in the strongest manner, he declared,\r\nthat as long as he had life he would use every faculty of his body and\r\nmind in endeavouring to promote its abolition.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell succeeded Mr. Montagu. He said, that although slavery\r\nwas repugnant to his feelings, he must vote against the abolition as\r\nvisionary and delusive. It was a feeble attempt, without the power, to\r\nserve the cause of humanity. Other nations would take up the trade.\r\nWhenever a bill of wise regulation should be brought forward, no man\r\nwould be more ready than himself to lend his support. In this way the\r\nrights of humanity might be asserted without injury to others. He hoped\r\nhe should not incur censure by his vote; for, let his understanding be\r\nwhat it might, he did not know that he had, notwithstanding the\r\nassertions of Mr. Fox, an inaccessible heart.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley (agent for the islands) rose next. He felt himself called\r\nupon, he said, to refute the many calumnies which had for years been\r\npropagated against the planters, (even through the medium of the pulpit,\r\nwhich should have been employed to better purposes,) and which had at\r\nlength produced the mischievous measure, which was now under the\r\ndiscussion of the House. A cry had been sounded forth, and from one end\r\nof the kingdom to the other, as if there had never been a slave from\r\nAdam to the present time. But it appeared to him to have been the\r\nintention of Providence, from the very beginning, that one set of men\r\nshould be slaves to another. This truth was as old as it was universal.\r\nIt was recognised in every history, under every government, and in every\r\nreligion. Nor did the Christian religion itself if the comments of Dr.\r\nHalifax, Bishop of Gloucester, on a passage of St. Paul's epistle to the\r\nCorinthians were true, show more repugnance to slavery than any other.\r\n\r\nHe denied that the slaves were procured in the manner which had been\r\ndescribed. It was the custom of all savages to kill their prisoners; and\r\nthe Africans ought to be thankful that they had been carried safe into\r\nthe British colonies.\r\n\r\nAs to the tales of misery in the Middle Passage, they were gross\r\nfalsehoods; and as to their treatment in the West Indies, he knew\r\npersonally that it was, in general, indulgent and humane.\r\n\r\nWith regard to promoting their increase by any better mode of treatment,\r\nhe wished gentlemen would point it out to him. As a planter he would\r\nthank them for it. It was absurd to suppose that he and others were\r\nblind to their own interest. It was well known that one Creole slave was\r\nworth two Africans; and their interest, therefore, must suggest to them,\r\nthat the propagation of slaves was preferable to the purchase of\r\nimported negroes, of whom one half very frequently died in the\r\nseasoning.\r\n\r\nHe then argued the impossibility of beasts doing the work of the\r\nplantations. He endeavoured to prove that the number of these adequate\r\nto this purpose could not be supplied with food; and after having made\r\nmany other observations, which, on account of the lowness of his voice,\r\ncould not be heard, he concluded by objecting to the motion.\r\n\r\nMr. William Smith rose. He wondered how the last speaker could have had\r\nthe boldness to draw arguments from scripture in support of the Slave\r\nTrade. Such arguments could be intended only to impose on those who\r\nnever took the trouble of thinking for themselves. Could it be thought\r\nfor a moment, that the good sense of the House could be misled by a few\r\nperverted or misapplied passages, in direct opposition to the whole\r\ntenor, and spirit of Christianity; to the theory, he might say, of\r\nalmost every religion, which had ever appeared in the world? Whatever\r\nmight have been advanced, every body must feel that the Slave Trade\r\ncould not exist an hour, if that excellent maxim, \"to do to others as we\r\nwould wish that others should do to us,\" had its proper influence on the\r\nconduct of men.\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Stanley more happy in his argument of the antiquity and\r\nuniversality of slavery. Because a practise had existed, did it\r\nnecessarily follow that it was just? By this argument every crime might\r\nbe defended from the time of Cain. The slaves of antiquity, however were\r\nin a situation far preferable to that of the negroes in the West Indies.\r\nA passage in Macrobius, which exemplified this in the strongest manner,\r\nwas now brought to his recollection. \"Our ancestors,\" says Macrobius,\r\n\"denominated the master, father of the family, and the slave, domestic,\r\nwith the intention of removing all odium from the condition of the\r\nmaster, and all contempt from that of the servant.\" Could this language\r\nbe applied to the present state of West India slavery?\r\n\r\nIt had been complained of by those who supported the trade, that they\r\nlaboured under great disadvantages by being obliged to contend against\r\nthe most splendid abilities which the House could boast. But he believed\r\nthey laboured under one, which was worse and for which no talents could\r\ncompensate; he meant the impossibility of maintaining their ground\r\nfairly on any of those principles, which every man within those walls\r\nhad been accustomed, from his infancy, to venerate as sacred. He and his\r\nfriends, too, laboured under some disadvantages. They had been charged\r\nwith fanaticism. But what had Mr. Long said, when he addressed himself\r\nto those planters, who were desirous of attempting improvements on their\r\nestates? He advised them \"not to be diverted by partial views, vulgar\r\nprejudices, or the ridicule which might spring from weak minds, from a\r\nbenevolent attention to the public good.\" But neither by these nor by\r\nother charges were he or his friends to be diverted from the prosecution\r\nof their purpose. They were convinced of the rectitude and high\r\nimportance of their object; and were determined never to desist from\r\npursuing it, till it should be attained.\r\n\r\nBut they had to struggle with difficulties far more serious. The West\r\nIndian interest which opposed them, was a collected body; of great\r\npower, affluence, connexions, and respectability.\r\n\r\nArtifice had also been employed. Abolition and emancipation had been so\r\noften confounded, and by those who knew better, that it must have been\r\npurposely done, to throw an odium on the measure which was now before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists had been also accused as the authors of the late\r\ninsurrection in Dominica. A revolt had certainly taken place in that\r\nisland. But revolts there had occured frequently before. Mr. Stanley\r\nhimself, in attempting to fix this charge upon them, had related\r\ncircumstance which amounted to their entire exculpation. He had said\r\nthat all was quiet there till the disturbances in the French islands;\r\nwhen some negroes from the latter had found their way to Dominica, and\r\nhad excited the insurrection in question. He had also said, that the\r\nnegroes in our own islands hated the idea of the abolition; for they\r\nthought, as no new labourers were to come in, they should be subjected\r\nto increased hardships. But if they and their masters hated this same\r\nmeasure, how was this coincidence of sentiment to give birth to\r\ninsurrections?\r\n\r\nOther fallacies, also, had been industriously propogated. Of the African\r\ntrade, it had been said, that the exports amounted to a million\r\nannually; whereas, from the report on the table, it had on an average\r\namounted to little more than half a million; and this included the\r\narticles for the purchase of African produce which were of the value of\r\n140,000_l._\r\n\r\nThe East Indian Trade, also, had been said to depend on the West Indian\r\nand the African. In the first place, it had but very little connexion\r\nwith the former at all. Its connexion with the latter was principally on\r\naccount of the saltpetre which it furnished for making gunpowder. Out of\r\nnearly three millions of pounds in weight of the latter article, which\r\nhad been exported in a year from this country, one-half had been sent to\r\nAfrica alone; for the purposes, doubtless, of maintaining peace, and\r\nencouraging civilization among its various tribes! Four or five thousand\r\npersons were said, also, to depend for their bread in manufacturing guns\r\nfor the African trade; and these, it was pretended, could not make guns\r\nof another sort.--But where lay the difficulty?--One of the witnesses\r\nhad unravelled it. He had seen the negroes maimed by the bursting of\r\nthese guns. They killed more from the butt than from the muzzle. Another\r\nhad stated, that on the sea-coast the natives were afraid to fire a\r\ntrade-gun.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indian commerce, two hundred and forty thousand tons of\r\nshipping were stated to be employed. But here deception intruded itself\r\nagain. This statement included every vessel, great and small, which went\r\nfrom the British West Indies to America, and to the foreign islands; and\r\nwhat was yet more unfair, all the repeated voyages of each throughout\r\nthe year. The shipping, which could only fairly be brought into this\r\naccount, did but just exceed half that which had been mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner had the islands themselves been overrated. Their\r\nvalue had been computed, for the information of the privy council, at\r\nthirty-six millions; but the planters had estimated them at seventy. The\r\ntruth, however, might possibly lie between these extremes. He by no\r\nmeans wished to depreciate their importance; but he did not like that\r\nsuch palpable misrepresentations should go unnoticed.\r\n\r\nAn honourable member (Colonel Tarleton) had disclaimed every attempt to\r\ninterest the feelings of those present, but had desired to call them to\r\nreason and accounts. He also desired (though it was a question of\r\nfeeling, if any one ever was,) to draw the attention of the committee to\r\nreason and accounts--to the voice of reason instead of that of\r\nprejudice, and to accounts in the place of idle apprehensions. The\r\nresult, he doubted not, would be a full persuasion, that policy and\r\njustice were inseparable upon this, as upon every other occasion.\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman had enlarged on the injustice of depriving the\r\nLiverpool merchants of a business, on which were founded their honour\r\nand their fortunes. On what part of it they founded their honour he\r\ncould not conjecture, except from those passages in the evidence, where\r\nit appeared, that their agents in Africa had systematically practised\r\nevery fraud and villany, which the meanest and most unprincipled cunning\r\ncould suggest, to impose on the ignorance of those with whom they\r\ntraded.\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman had also lamented, that the evidence had not been\r\ntaken upon oath. He himself lamented it too. Numberless facts had been\r\nrelated by eye-witnesses, called in support of the abolition, so\r\ndreadfully atrocious, that they appeared incredible; and seemed rather,\r\nto use the expression of Ossian, like \"the histories of the days of\r\nother times.\" These procured for the trade a species of acquittal, which\r\nit could not have obtained, had the committee been authorised to\r\nadminister an oath. He apprehended, also, in this case, that some other\r\npersons would have been rather more guarded in their testimony. Captain\r\nKnox would not then perhaps have told the committee, that six hundred\r\nslaves could have had comfortable room at night in his vessel of about\r\none hundred and forty tons; when there could have been no more than five\r\nfeet six inches in length, and fifteen inches in breadth, to about\r\ntwo-thirds of his number.\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman had also dwelt upon the Slave Trade as a nursery for\r\nseamen. But it had appeared by the muster-rolls of the slave-vessels,\r\nthen actually on the table of the house, that more than a fifth of them\r\ndied in the service, exclusive of those who perished when discharged in\r\nthe West Indies; and yet he had been instructed by his constituents to\r\nmaintain this false position. His reasoning, too, was very curious; for,\r\nthough numbers might die, yet as one half who entered were landsmen,\r\nseamen were continually forming. Not to dwell on the expensive cruelty\r\nof forming these seamen by the yearly destruction of so many hundreds,\r\nthis very statement was flatly contradicted by the evidence. The\r\nmuster-rolls from Bristol stated the proportion of landsmen in the trade\r\nthere at one twelfth, and the proper officers of Liverpool itself at but\r\na sixteenth of the whole employed. In the face again of the most glaring\r\nfacts, others had maintained that the mortality in these vessels did not\r\nexceed that of other trades in the tropical climates. But the same\r\ndocuments, which proved that twenty-three per cent were destroyed in\r\nthis wasting traffic, proved that in West India ships only about one and\r\na half per cent were lost, including every casualty. But the very men,\r\nunder whose management this dreadful mortality had been constantly\r\noccurring, had coolly said, that much of it might be avoided by proper\r\nregulations. How criminal then were they, who, knowing this, had neither\r\npublicly proposed, nor in their practice adopted, a remedy!\r\n\r\nThe average loss of the slaves on board, which had been calculated by\r\nMr. Wilberforce at twelve and a half per cent., had been denied. He\r\nbelieved this calculation, taking in all the circumstances connected\r\nwith it, to be true; but that for years not less than one-tenth had so\r\nperished, he would challenge those concerned in the traffic to disprove.\r\nMuch evidence had been produced on the subject; but the voyages had been\r\ngenerally selected. There was only one who had disclosed the whole\r\naccount. This was Mr. Anderson of London, whose engagements in this\r\ntrade had been very inconsiderable. His loss had only amounted to three\r\nper cent.; but, unfortunately for the slave-traders of Liverpool, his\r\nvessel had not taken above three-fourths of that number in proportion to\r\nthe tonnage which they had stated to be necessary to the very existence\r\nof their trade.\r\n\r\nAn honourable member (Mr. Grosvenor) had attributed the protraction of\r\nthis business to those who had introduced it. But from whom did the\r\nmotion for further evidence (when that of the privy council was refused)\r\noriginate, but from the enemies of the abolition? The same gentleman had\r\nsaid, it was impossible to abolish the trade; but where was the\r\nimpossibility of forbidding the further importation of slaves into our\r\nown colonies? and beyond this the motion did not extend.\r\n\r\nThe latter argument had also been advanced by Sir William Yonge and\r\nothers. But allowing it its full force, would there be no honour in the\r\ndereliction of such a commerce? Would it be nothing publicly to\r\nrecognise great and just principles? Would our example be nothing!--Yes:\r\nevery country would learn, from our experiment, that American colonies\r\ncould be cultivated without the necessity of continual supplies equally\r\nexpensive and disgraceful.\r\n\r\nBut we might do more than merely lay down principles or propose\r\nexamples. We might, in fact, diminish the evil itself immediately by no\r\ninconsiderable part,--by the whole of our own supply; and here he could\r\nnot at all agree with the honourable baronet, in what seemed to him a\r\ncommercial paradox, that the taking away from an open trade by far the\r\nlargest customer, and the lessening of the consumption of the article,\r\nwould increase both the competition and the demand, and of course all\r\nthose mischiefs, which it was their intention to avert.\r\n\r\nThat the civilization of the Africans was promoted, as had been\r\nasserted, by their intercourse with the Europeans, was void of\r\nfoundation, as had appeared from the evidence. In manners and dishonesty\r\nthey had indeed assimilated with those who frequented their coasts. But\r\nthe greatest industry and the least corruption of morals were in the\r\ninterior, where they were out of the way of this civilizing connexion.\r\n\r\nTo relieve Africa from famine, was another of the benign reasons which\r\nhad been assigned for continuing the trade. That famines had occurred\r\nthere, he did not doubt; but that they should annually occur, and with\r\nsuch arithmetical exactness as to suit the demands of the Slave Trade,\r\nwas a circumstance most extraordinary; so wonderful, indeed, that, could\r\nit once be proved, he should consider it as a far better argument in\r\nfavour of the divine approbation of that trade, than any which had ever\r\nyet been produced.\r\n\r\nAs to the effect of the abolition on the West Indies, it would give\r\nweight to every humane regulation which had been made; by substituting a\r\ncertain and obvious interest, in the place of one depending upon chances\r\nand calculation. An honourable member (Mr. Stanley) had spoken of the\r\nimpossibility of cultivating the estates there without further\r\nimportations of negroes; and yet, of all the authorities he had brought\r\nto prove his case, there was scarcely one which might not be pressed to\r\nserve more or less effectually against him. Almost every planter he had\r\nnamed had found his negroes increase under the good treatment he had\r\nprofessed to give them; and it was an axiom, throughout the whole\r\nevidence, that, wherever they were well used, importations were not\r\nnecessary. It had been said, indeed, by some adverse witnesses, that in\r\nJamaica all possible means had been used to keep up the stock by\r\nbreeding; but how preposterous was this, when it was allowed that the\r\nmorals of the slaves had been totally neglected, and that the planters\r\npreferred buying a larger proportion of males than females!\r\n\r\nThe misfortune was, that prejudice, and not reason, was the enemy to be\r\nsubdued. The prejudices of the West Indians on these points were\r\nnumerous and inveterate. Mr. Long himself had characterised them on this\r\naccount, in terms which he should have felt diffident in using. But Mr.\r\nLong had shown his own prejudices also: for he justified the chaining of\r\nthe Negroes on board the slave-vessels, on account of \"their bloody,\r\ncruel, and malicious dispositions.\" But hear his commendation of some of\r\nthe Aborigines of Jamaica, \"who had miserably perished in caves, whither\r\nthey had retired to escape the tyranny of the Spaniards. These,\" says\r\nhe, \"left a glorious monument of their having disdained to survive the\r\nloss of their liberty and their country.\" And yet this same historian\r\ncould not perceive that this natural love of liberty might operate as\r\nstrongly and as laudably in the African Negro, as in the Indian of\r\nJamaica.\r\n\r\nHe was concerned to acknowledge that these prejudices were yet further\r\nstrengthened by resentment against those who had taken an active part in\r\nthe abolition of the Slave Trade. But it was never the object of these\r\nto throw a stigma on the whole body of the West Indians; but to prove\r\nthe miserable effects of the trade. This it was their duty to do; and\r\nif, in doing this, disgraceful circumstances had come out, it was not\r\ntheir fault; and it must never be forgotten that they were true.\r\n\r\nThat the slaves were exposed to great misery in the islands, was true as\r\nwell from inference as from facts: for what might not be expected from\r\nthe use of arbitrary power, where the three characters of party, judge,\r\nand executioner were united! The slaves, too, were more capable on\r\naccount of their passions, than the beasts in the field, of exciting the\r\npassions of their tyrants. To what a length the ill-treatment of them\r\nmight be carried, might be learnt from, the instance which General\r\nTottenham mentioned to have seen in the year 1780 in the streets of\r\nBridge Town, Barbados: \"A youth about nineteen (to use his own words in\r\nthe evidence), entirely naked, with an iron collar about his neck,\r\nhaving five long projecting spikes. His body both before and behind was\r\ncovered with wounds. His belly and thighs were almost cut to pieces,\r\nwith running ulcers all over them; and a finger might have been laid in\r\nsome of the weals. He could not sit down, because his hinder part was\r\nmortified; and it was impossible for him to lie down, on account of the\r\nprongs of his collar.\" He supplicated the General for relief. The latter\r\nasked who had punished him so dreadfully? The youth answered, his master\r\nhad done it. And because he could not work, this same master, in the\r\nsame spirit of perversion, which extorts from Scripture a justification\r\nof the Slave Trade, had fulfilled the apostolic maxim, that he should\r\nhave nothing to eat. The use he meant to make of this instance was to\r\nshow the unprotected state of the slaves. What must it be, where such an\r\ninstance could pass not only unpunished, but almost unregarded! If, in\r\nthe streets of London, but a dog were to be seen lacerated like this\r\nmiserable man, how would the cruelty of the wretch be execrated, who had\r\nthus even abused a brute!\r\n\r\nThe judicial punishments also inflicted upon the Negro showed the low\r\nestimation, in which, in consequence of the strength of old customs and\r\ndeep-rooted prejudices, they were held. Mr. Edwards, in his speech to\r\nthe Assembly at Jamaica, stated the following case, as one which had\r\nhappened in one of the rebellions there. Some slaves surrounded the\r\ndwelling-house of their mistress. She was in bed with a lovely infant.\r\nThey deliberated upon the means of putting her to death in torment. But\r\nin the end one of them reserved her for his mistress; and they killed\r\nher infant with an axe before her face. \"Now,\" says Mr. Edwards,\r\n(addressing himself to his audience) \"you will think that no torments\r\nwere too great for such horrible excesses. Nevertheless I am of a\r\ndifferent opinion. I think that death, unaccompanied with cruelty,\r\nshould be the utmost exertion of human authority over our unhappy\r\nfellow-creatures.\" Torments, however, were always inflicted in these\r\ncases. The punishment was gibbeting alive, and exposing the delinquents\r\nto perish by the gradual effects of hunger, thirst, and parching sun; in\r\nwhich situation they were known to suffer for nine days, with a\r\nfortitude scarcely credible, never uttering a single groan. But horrible\r\nas the excesses might have been, which occasioned these punishments, it\r\nmust be remembered, that they were committed by ignorant savages, who\r\nhad been dragged from all they held most dear; whose patience had been\r\nexhausted by a cruel and loathsome confinement during their\r\ntransportation; and whose resentment had been wound up to the highest\r\npitch of fury by the lash of the driver.\r\n\r\nBut he would now mention another instance, by way of contrast, out of\r\nthe evidence. A child on board a slave-ship, of about ten months old,\r\ntook sulk and would not eat. The captain flogged it with a cat; swearing\r\nthat he would make it eat, or kill it. From this and other ill-treatment\r\nthe child's legs swelled. He then ordered some water to be made hot to\r\nabate the swelling. But even his tender mercies were cruel; for the\r\ncook, on putting his hand into the water, said it was too hot. Upon this\r\nthe captain swore at him, and ordered the feet to be put in. This was\r\ndone. The nails and skin came off. Oiled cloths were then put round\r\nthem. The child was at length tied to a heavy log. Two or three days\r\nafterwards, the captain caught it up again; and repeated that he would\r\nmade it eat, or kill it. He immediately flogged it again, and in a\r\nquarter of an hour it died. But, after the child was dead, whom should\r\nthe barbarian select to throw it overboard, but the wretched mother? In\r\nvain she started from the office. He beat her, till he made her take up\r\nthe child and carry it to the side of the vessel. She then dropped it\r\ninto the sea, turning her head the other way that she might not see it.\r\nNow it would naturally be asked, was not this captain also gibbeted\r\nalive? Alas! although the execrable barbarity of the European exceeded\r\nthat of the Africans before mentioned, almost as much as his\r\nopportunities of instruction has been greater than theirs, no notice\r\nwhatsoever was taken of this horrible action; and a thousand similar\r\ncruelties had been committed in this abominable trade with equal\r\nimpunity: but he would say no more. He would vote for the abolition, not\r\nonly as it would do away all the evils complained of in Africa and the\r\nMiddle Passage; but as it would be the most effectual means of\r\nameliorating the condition of those unhappy persons, who were still to\r\ncontinue slaves in the British colonies.\r\n\r\nMr. Courtenay rose. He said, he could not but consider the assertion of\r\nSir William Yonge as a mistake, that the Slave Trade, if abandoned by\r\nus, would fall into the hands of France. It ought to be recollected,\r\nwith what approbation the motion for abolishing it, made by the late\r\nMirabeau, had been received; although the situation of the French\r\ncolonies might then have presented obstacles to carrying the measure\r\ninto immediate execution. He had no doubt, if parliament were to begin,\r\nso wise and enlightened a body as the National Assembly would follow the\r\nexample. But even if France were not to relinquish the trade, how could\r\nwe, if justice required its abolition, hesitate as to our part of it?\r\n\r\nThe trade, it had been said, was conducted upon the principles of\r\nhumanity. Yes: we rescued the Africans from what we were pleased to call\r\ntheir wretched situation in their own; country, and then we took credit\r\nfor our humanity; because, after having killed one half of them in the\r\nseasoning, we substituted what we were again pleased to call a better\r\ntreatment than that which they would have experienced at home.\r\n\r\nIt had been stated that the principle of war among savages was a general\r\nmassacre. This was not true. They frequently adopted the captives into\r\ntheir own families; and, so far from massacring the women and children,\r\nthey often gave them the protection which the weakness of their age and\r\nsex demanded.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt, that the practice of kidnapping; prevailed in\r\nAfrica. As to witchcraft, it had been made a crime in the reign of James\r\nthe First in this country, for the purpose of informations; and how much\r\nmore likely were informations to take place in Africa, under the\r\nencouragement afforded by the Slave Trade! This trade, it had been said,\r\nwas sanctioned by twenty-six acts of parliament. He did not doubt but\r\nfifty-six might be found, by which parliament had sanctioned witchcraft\r\nof the existence of which we had now no belief whatever....\r\n\r\nIt had been said by Mr. Stanley that the pulpit had been used as an\r\ninstrument of attack on the Slave Trade. He was happy to learn it had\r\nbeen so well employed; and he hoped the Bishops would rise up in the\r\nHouse of Lords, with the virtuous indignation which became them, to\r\nabolish a traffic so contrary to humanity, justice, and religion.\r\n\r\nHe entreated every member to recollect, that on his vote that night\r\ndepended the happiness of millions; and that it was then in his power to\r\npromote a measure, of which the benefits would be felt over one whole\r\nquarter of the globe; that the seeds of civilization might, by the\r\npresent bill, be sown all over Africa: and the first principles of\r\nhumanity be established in regions where they had hitherto been excluded\r\nby the existence of this execrable trade.\r\n\r\nLord Carysfort rose, and said, that the great cause of the abolition had\r\nflourished by the manner in which it had been opposed. No one argument\r\nof solid weight had been adduced against it. It had been shown, but\r\nnever disproved, that the colonial laws were inadequate to the\r\nprotection of the slaves; that the punishments of the latter were most\r\nunmerciful; that they were deprived of the right of self-defence against\r\nany White man; and, in short, that the system was totally repugnant to\r\nthe principles of the British constitution.\r\n\r\nColonel Phipps followed Lord Carysfort. He denied that this was a\r\nquestion in which the rights of humanity and the laws of nature were\r\nconcerned. The Africans became slaves in consequence of the constitution\r\nof their own governments. These were founded in absolute despotism.\r\nEvery subject was an actual slave. The inhabitants were slaves to the\r\ngreat men, and the great men were slaves to the prince. Prisoners of\r\nwar, too, were by law subject to slavery. Such being the case, he saw no\r\nmore cruelty in disposing of them to our merchants, than to those of any\r\nother nation. Criminals, also, in cases of adultery and witchcraft,\r\nbecame slaves by the same laws.\r\n\r\nIt had been said, that there were no regulations in the West Indies for\r\nthe protection of slaves. There were several; though he was ready to\r\nadmit that more were necessary; and he would go in this respect as far\r\nas humanity might require. He had passed ten months in Jamaica, where he\r\nhad never seen any such acts of cruelty as had been talked of. Those\r\nwhich he had seen were not exercised by the Whites, but by the Blacks.\r\nThe dreadful stories which had been told, ought no more to fix a general\r\nstigma upon the planters, than the story of Mrs. Brownrigg to stamp this\r\npolished metropolis with the general brand of murder. There was once a\r\nhaberdasher's wife (Mrs. Nairne) who locked up her apprentice girl, and\r\nstarved her to death; but did ever any body think of abolishing\r\nhaberdashery on this account? He was persuaded the Negroes in the West\r\nIndies were cheerful and happy. They were fond of ornaments; but it was\r\nnot the characteristic of miserable persons to show a taste for finery.\r\nSuch a taste, on the contrary, implied a cheerful and contented mind. He\r\nwas sorry to differ from his friend Mr. Wilberforce, but he must oppose\r\nhis motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt rose, and said, that from the first hour of his having had the\r\nhonour to sit in parliament down to the present, among all the\r\nquestions, whether political or personal, in which it had been his\r\nfortune to take a share, there had never been one in which his heart was\r\nso deeply interested as in the present; both, on account of the serious\r\nprinciples it involved, and the consequences connected with it.\r\n\r\nThe present was not a mere question of feeling. The argument, which\r\nought, in his opinion, to determine the committee, was, that the Slave\r\nTrade was unjust. It was, therefore, such a trade as it was impossible\r\nfor him to support, unless it could be first proved to him, that there\r\nwere no laws of morality binding upon nations; and that it was not the\r\nduty of a legislature to restrain its subjects, from invading the\r\nhappiness of other countries, and from violating; the fundamental\r\nprinciples of justice.\r\n\r\nSeveral had stated the impracticability of the measure before them. They\r\nwished to see the trade abolished; but there was some necessity for\r\ncontinuing it, which they conceived to exist. Nay, almost every, one, he\r\nbelieved, appeared to wish that the further importation of slaves might\r\ncease, provided, it could be made out that, the population of the West\r\nIndies could be maintained without it. He proposed, therefore, to\r\nconsider the latter point; for, as the impracticability of keeping up\r\nthe population there appeared to operate as the chief objection, he\r\ntrusted that, by showing it to be ill founded, he should clear away all\r\nother obstacles whatever; so that, having no ground either of justice or\r\nnecessity to stand upon, there could be no excuse left to the committee\r\nfor resisting the present motion.\r\n\r\nHe might reasonably, however, hope that they would not reckon any small\r\nor temporary disadvantage, which might arise from the abolition, to be a\r\nsufficient reason against it. It was surely not any slight degree of\r\nexpediency, nor any small balance of profit, nor any light shades of\r\nprobability on the one side, rather than on the other, which would\r\ndetermine them on this question. He asked pardon even for the\r\nsupposition. The Slave Trade was an evil of such magnitude, that there\r\nmust be a common wish in the committee at once to put an end to it, if\r\nthere were no great and serious obstacles. It was a trade, by which\r\nmultitudes of unoffending nations were deprived of the blessings of\r\ncivilization, and had their peace and happiness invaded. It ought,\r\ntherefore, to be no common expediency, it ought to be nothing less than\r\nthe utter ruin of our islands, which it became those to plead, who took\r\nupon them to defend the continuance of it.\r\n\r\nHe could not help thinking that the West India gentlemen had manifested\r\nan over great degree of sensibility as to the point in question; and\r\nthat their alarms had been unreasonably excited upon it. He had examined\r\nthe subject carefully for himself: and he would now detail those\r\nreasons, which had induced him firmly to believe, not only that no\r\npermanent mischief would follow from the abolition, but not even any\r\nsuch temporary inconvenience as could be stated to be a reason for\r\npreventing the House from agreeing to the motion before them; on the\r\ncontrary, that the abolition itself would lay the foundation for the\r\nmore solid improvement of all the various interests of those colonies.\r\n\r\nIn doing this he should apply his observations chiefly to Jamaica, which\r\ncontained more than half the slaves in the British West Indies; and if\r\nhe should succeed in proving that no material detriment could arise to\r\nthe population there, this would afford so strong a presumption with\r\nrespect to the other islands, that the House could no longer hesitate\r\nwhether they should, or should not, put a stop to this most horrid\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty years ending in 1788, the annual loss of slaves in Jamaica\r\n(that is, the excess of deaths above the births,) appeared to be one in\r\nthe hundred. In a preceding period the loss was greater; and, in a\r\nperiod before that greater still; there having been a continual\r\ngradation in the decrease through the whole time. It might fairly be\r\nconcluded, therefore, that (the average logs of the last period being\r\none per cent.) the loss in the former part of it would be somewhat more,\r\nand in the latter part somewhat less, than one per cent; insomuch that\r\nit might be fairly questioned, whether, by this time, the births and\r\ndeaths in Jamaica might not be stated as nearly equal. It was to be\r\nadded, that a peculiar calamity, which swept away fifteen thousand\r\nslaves, had occasioned a part of the mortality in the last-mentioned\r\nperiod. The probable loss, therefore, now to be expected, was very\r\ninconsiderable indeed.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one circumstance to be added, which the West India\r\ngentlemen, in stating this matter, had entirely overlooked; and which\r\nwas so material, as clearly to reduce the probable diminution in the\r\npopulation of Jamaica down to nothing. In all the calculations he had\r\nreferred to of the comparative number of births and deaths, all the\r\nNegroes in the island were included. The newly imported, who died in the\r\nseasoning, made apart; but these swelled, most materially, the number of\r\nthe deaths. Now, as these extraordinary deaths would cease, as soon as\r\nthe importation ceased, a deduction of them ought to be made from his\r\npresent calculation.\r\n\r\nBut the number of those, who thus died in the seasoning, would make up\r\nof itself nearly the whole of that one per cent. which had been stated.\r\nHe particularly pressed an attention to this circumstance; for the\r\ncomplaint of being likely to want hands in Jamaica, arose from the\r\nmistake of including the present unnatural deaths, caused by the\r\nseasoning, among the natural and perpetual muses of mortality. These\r\ndeaths, being erroneously taken into the calculations, gave the planters\r\nan idea that the numbers could not be kept up. These deaths, which were\r\ncaused merely by the Slave Trade, furnished the very ground, therefore,\r\non which the continuance of that trade had been thought necessary.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as to this point was clear; for it would be found in that\r\ndreadful catalogue of deaths, arising from the seasoning and the\r\npassage, which the House had been condemned to look into, that one half\r\ndied. An annual mortality of two thousand slaves in Jamaica might be\r\ntherefore charged to the importation; which, compared with the whole\r\nnumber on the island, hardly fell short of the whole one per cent.\r\ndecrease.\r\n\r\nJoining this with all the other considerations, he would then ask, could\r\nthe decrease of the slaves in Jamaica be such--could the colonies be so\r\ndestitute of means--could the planters, when by their own accounts they\r\nwere establishing daily new regulations for the benefit of the\r\nslaves--could they, under all these circumstances, be permitted to plead\r\nthat total impossibility of keeping up their number, which they had\r\nrested on, as being indeed the only possible pretext for allowing fresh\r\nimportations from Africa? He appealed, therefore, to the sober judgment\r\nof all, whether the situation of Jamaica was such, as to justify a\r\nhesitation in agreeing to the present motion.\r\n\r\nIt might be observed, also, that, when the importations should stop,\r\nthat disproportion between the sexes, which was one of the obstacles to\r\npopulation, would gradually diminish; and a natural order of things be\r\nestablished. Through the want of this natural order, a thousand\r\ngrievances were created, which it was impossible to define; and which it\r\nwas in vain to think that, under such circumstances, we could cure. But\r\nthe abolition, of itself, would work this desirable effect. The West\r\nIndians would then feel a near and urgent interest to enter into a\r\nthousand little details, which it was impossible for him to describe,\r\nbut which would have the greatest influence on population. A foundation\r\nwould thus be laid for the general welfare of the islands; a new system\r\nwould rise up, the reverse of the old; and eventually both their general\r\nwealth and happiness would increase.\r\n\r\nHe had now proved far more than he was bound to do; for, if he could\r\nonly show that the abolition would not be ruinous, it would be enough.\r\nHe could give up, therefore, three arguments out of four, through the\r\nwhole of what he had said, and yet have enough left for his position. As\r\nto the Creoles, they would undoubtedly increase. They differed in this\r\nentirely from the imported slaves, who were both a burthen and a curse\r\nto themselves and others. The measure now proposed would operate like a\r\ncharm; and, besides stopping all the miseries in Africa and the passage,\r\nwould produce even more benefit in the West Indies than legal\r\nregulations could effect.\r\n\r\nHe would now just touch upon the question of emancipation. A rash\r\nemancipation of the slaves would be mischievous. In that unhappy\r\nsituation, to which our baneful conduct had brought ourselves and them,\r\nit would be no justice on either side to give them liberty. They were as\r\nyet incapable of it; but their situation might be gradually amended.\r\nThey might be relieved from everything harsh and severe; raised from\r\ntheir present degraded state; and put under the protection of the law.\r\nTill then, to talk of emancipation was insanity. But it was the system\r\nof fresh importations, which interfered with these principles of\r\nimprovement; and it was only the abolition which could establish them.\r\nThis suggestion had its foundation in human nature. Wherever the\r\nincentive of honour, credit, and fair profit appeared, energy would\r\nspring up; and when these labourers should have the natural springs of\r\nhuman action afforded them, they would then rise to the natural level of\r\nhuman industry.\r\n\r\nFrom Jamaica he would now go to the other islands. In Barbadoes the\r\nslaves had rather increased. In St. Kitts the decrease for fourteen\r\nyears had been but three-fourths per cent.; but here many of the\r\nobservations would apply, which he had used in the case of Jamaica. In\r\nAntigua many had died by a particular calamity. But for this, the\r\ndecrease would have been trifling. In Nevis and Montserrat there was\r\nlittle or no disproportion of the sexes; so that it might well be hoped,\r\nthat the numbers would be kept up in these islands. In Dominica some\r\ncontroversy had arisen about the calculation; but Governor Orde had\r\nstated an increase of births above the deaths. From Grenada and St.\r\nVincent's no accurate accounts had been delivered in answer to the\r\nqueries sent them; but they were probably not in circumstances less\r\nfavourable than in the other islands.\r\n\r\nOn a full review, then, of the state of the Negro population in the West\r\nIndies, was there any serious ground of alarm from the abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade? Where was the impracticability, on which alone so many had\r\nrested their objections? Must we not blush at pretending, that it would\r\ndistress our consciences to accede to this measure, as far as the\r\nquestion of the Negro population was concerned?\r\n\r\nIntolerable were the mischiefs of this trade, both in its origin, and\r\nthrough every stage of its progress. To say that slaves could be\r\nfurnished us by fair and commercial means was ridiculous. The trade\r\nsometimes ceased, as during the late war. The demand was more or less\r\naccording to circumstances. But how was it possible, that to a demand so\r\nexceedingly fluctuating the supply should always exactly accommodate\r\nitself? Alas! We made human beings the subject of commerce; we talked of\r\nthem as such; and yet we would not allow them the common principle of\r\ncommerce, that the supply must accommodate itself to the consumption. It\r\nwas not from wars, then, that the slaves were chiefly procured. They\r\nwere obtained in proportion as they were wanted. If a demand for slaves\r\narose, a supply was forced in one way or other; and it was in vain,\r\noverpowered as we then were with positive evidence, as well as the\r\nreasonableness of the supposition, to deny that by the Slave Trade we\r\noccasioned all the enormities which had been alleged against it.\r\n\r\nSir William Yonge had said, that if we were not to take the Africans\r\nfrom their country, they would be destroyed. But he had not yet read\r\nthat all uncivilized nations destroyed their captives. We assumed,\r\ntherefore, what was false. The very selling of them implied this; for,\r\nif they would sell their captives for profit, why should they not employ\r\nthem so as to receive a profit also? Nay, many of them, while there was\r\nno demand from the slave merchants, were often actually so employed. The\r\ntrade, too, had been suspended during the war; and it was never said, or\r\nthought, that any such consequence had then followed.\r\n\r\nThe honourable baronet had also said, to justification of the Slave\r\nTrade, that witchcraft commonly implied poison, and was therefore a\r\npunishable crime; but did he recollect that not only the individual\r\naccused, but that his whole family, were sold as slaves? The truth was,\r\nwe stopped the natural progress of civilization in Africa. We cut her\r\noff from the opportunity of improvement. We kept her down in a state of\r\ndarkness, bondage, ignorance, and bloodshed. Was not this an awful\r\nconsideration for this country? Look at the map of Africa, and see how\r\nlittle useful intercourse had been established on that vast continent!\r\nWhile other countries were assisting and enlightening each other, Africa\r\nalone had none of these benefits. We had obtained as yet only so much\r\nknowledge of her productions, as to show that there was a capacity for\r\ntrade, which we checked. Indeed, if the mischiefs there were out of the\r\nquestion, the circumstance of the Middle Passage alone would, in his\r\nmind, be reason enough for the abolition. Such a scene as that of the\r\nslave-ships passing over with their wretched cargoes to the West Indies,\r\nif it could be spread before the eyes of the House, would be sufficient\r\nof itself to make them vote in favour of it; but when it could be added,\r\nthat the interest even of the West Indies themselves rested on the\r\naccomplishment of this great event, he could not conceive an act of more\r\nimperious duty, than that which was imposed upon the House, of agreeing\r\nto the present motion.\r\n\r\nSir Archibald Edmonstone rose, and asked whether the present motion went\r\nso far as to pledge those who voted for it to a total and immediate\r\nabolition.\r\n\r\nMr. Alderman Watson rose next. He defended the Slave Trade as highly\r\nbeneficial to the country, being one material branch of its commerce.\r\nBut he could not think of the African trade without connecting it with\r\nthe West Indian. The one hung upon the other. A third important branch\r\nalso depended upon it, which was the Newfoundland fishery; the latter\r\ncould not go on, if it were not for the vast quantity of inferior fish\r\nbought up for the Negroes in the West Indies, and which quite unfit for\r\nany other market. If, therefore, we destroyed the African, we destroyed\r\nthe other trades. Mr. Turgot, he said, had recommended in the National\r\nAssembly of France the gradual abolition of the Slave Trade. He would,\r\ntherefore, recommend it to the House to adopt the same measure, and to\r\nsoften the rigours of slavery by wholesome regulations; but an immediate\r\nabolition he could not countenance.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox at length rose. He observed that some expressions which he had\r\nused on the preceding day, had been complained of as too harsh and\r\nsevere. He had since considered them, but he could not prevail upon\r\nhimself to retract them; because, if any gentleman, after reading the\r\nevidence on the table, and attending to the debate, could avow himself\r\nan abettor of this shameful traffic in human flesh, it could only be\r\neither from some hardness of heart, or some difficulty of understanding,\r\nwhich he really knew not how to account for.\r\n\r\nSome had considered this question as a question of political, whereas,\r\nit was a question of personal, freedom. Political freedom was\r\nundoubtedly a great blessing; but when it came to be compared with\r\npersonal, it sunk to nothing. To confound the two, served, therefore, to\r\nrender all arguments on either perplexing and unintelligible. Personal\r\nfreedom was the first right of every human being. It was a right, of\r\nwhich he who deprived a fellow-creature was absolutely criminal in so\r\ndepriving him, and which he who withheld was no less criminal in\r\nwithholding. He could not, therefore, retract his words with respect to\r\nany, who (whatever respect he might otherwise have for them) should, by\r\ntheir vote of that night, deprive their fellow-creatures of so great a\r\nblessing. Nay, he would go further. He would say, that if the House,\r\nknowing what the trade was by the evidence, did not, by their vote, mark\r\nto all mankind their abhorrence of a practice so savage, so enormous, so\r\nrepugnant to all laws human and divine, they would consign their\r\ncharacter to eternal infamy.\r\n\r\nThat the pretence of danger to our West Indian islands from the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade was totally unfounded, Mr. Wilberforce had\r\nabundantly proved; but if there were they who had not been satisfied\r\nwith that proof, was it possible to resist the arguments of Mr. Pitt on\r\nthe same subject? It had been shown, on a comparison of the births and\r\ndeaths in Jamaica, that there was not now any decrease of the slaves.\r\nBut if there had been, it would have made no difference to him in his\r\nvote; for, had the mortality been ever so great there, he should have\r\nascribed it to the system of importing Negroes, instead of that of\r\nencouraging their natural increase. Was it not evident that the planters\r\nthought it more convenient to buy them fit for work, than to breed them?\r\nWhy, then, was this horrid trade to be kept up?--To give the planters\r\ntruly the liberty of misusing their slaves, so as to check population:\r\nfor it was from ill-usage only that, in a climate so natural to them,\r\ntheir numbers could diminish. The very ground, therefore, on which the\r\nplanters rested the necessity of fresh importations, namely, the\r\ndestruction of lives in the West Indies, was itself the strongest\r\nargument that could be given, and furnished the most imperious call upon\r\nparliament for the abolition of the trade.\r\n\r\nAgainst this trade innumerable were the charges. An honourable member,\r\nMr. Smith, had done well to introduce those tragical stories which had\r\nmade such an impression upon the House. No one of these had been yet\r\ncontroverted. It had, indeed, been said; that the cruelty of the African\r\ncaptain to the child was too bad to be true; and we had been desired to\r\nlook at the cross-examination of the witness, as if we should find\r\ntraces of the falsehood in his testimony there. But his\r\ncross-examination was peculiarly honourable to his character; for, after\r\nhe had been pressed in the closest manner by some able members of the\r\nHouse, the only inconsistency they could fix upon him was, whether the\r\nfact had happened on the same day of the same month of the year 1764 or\r\nthe year 1765.\r\n\r\nBut it was idle to talk of the incredibility of such instances. It was\r\nnot denied that absolute power was exercised by the slave-captains; and\r\nif this was granted, all the cruelties charged upon them would naturally\r\nfollow. Never did he hear of charges so black and horrible as those\r\ncontained in the evidence on the table. They unfolded such a scene of\r\ncruelty, that if the House, with all their present knowledge of the\r\ncircumstances, should dare to vote for its continuance, they must have\r\nnerves of which he had no conception. We might find instances, indeed,\r\nin history, of men violating the feelings of nature on extraordinary\r\noccasions. Fathers had sacrificed their sons and daughters, and husbands\r\ntheir wives; but to imitate their characters, we ought to have not only\r\nnerves as strong as the two Brutuses, but to take care that we had a\r\ncause as good; or that we had motives for such a dereliction of our\r\nfeelings as patriotic as those which historians had annexed to these\r\nwhen they handed them to the notice of the world.\r\n\r\nBut what was our motive in the case before us?--to continue a trade\r\nwhich was a wholesale sacrifice of a whole order and race of our\r\nfellow-creatures, which carried them away by force from their native\r\ncountry, in order to subject them to the mere will and caprice, the\r\ntyranny and oppression of other human beings, for their whole natural\r\nlives, them and their posterity for ever!! O most monstrous wickedness!\r\nO unparalleled barbarity! And, what was more aggravating, this most\r\ncomplicated scene of robbery and murder which mankind had ever\r\nwitnessed, had been honoured by the name of trade.\r\n\r\nThat a number of human beings should be at all times ready to be\r\nfurnished as fair articles of commerce, just as our occasions might\r\nrequire, was absurd. The argument of Mr. Pitt on this head was\r\nunanswerable. Our demand was fluctuating: it entirely ceased at some\r\ntimes: at others it was great and pressing. How was it possible, on\r\nevery sudden call, to furnish a sufficient return in slaves, without\r\nresorting to those execrable means of obtaining them, which were stated\r\nin the evidence? These were of three sorts, and he would now examine\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCaptives in war, it was urged, were consigned either to death or\r\nslavery. This, however, he believed to be false in point of fact. But\r\nsuppose it were true; did it not become us, with whom it was a custom,\r\nfounded in the wisest policy, to pay the captives a peculiar respect and\r\ncivility, to inculcate the same principles in Africa? But we were so far\r\nfrom doing this, that we encouraged wars for the sake of taking, not\r\nmen's goods and possessions, but men themselves; and it was not the war\r\nwhich was the cause of the Slave Trade, but the Slave Trade which was\r\nthe cause of the war. It was the practice of the slave-merchants to try\r\nto intoxicate the African kings in order to turn them to their purpose.\r\nA particular instance occurred in the evidence of a prince, who, when\r\nsober, resisted their wishes; but in the moment of inebriety he gave the\r\nword for war, attacked the next village, and sold the inhabitants to the\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\nThe second mode was kidnapping. He referred the House to various\r\ninstances of this in the evidence: but there was one in particular, from\r\nwhich we might immediately infer the frequency of the practice. A black\r\ntrader had kidnapped a girl and sold her; but he was presently\r\nafterwards kidnapped and sold himself; and, when he asked the captain\r\nwho bought him, \"What! do you buy me, who am a great trader?\" the only\r\nanswer was, \"Yes, I will buy you, or her, or anybody else, provided any\r\none will sell you;\" and accordingly both the trader and the girl were\r\ncarried to the West Indies, and sold for slaves.\r\n\r\nThe third mode of obtaining slaves was by crimes committed or imputed.\r\nOne of these was adultery. But was Africa the place, where Englishmen,\r\nabove all others, were to go to find out and punish adultery? Did it\r\nbecome us to cast the first stone? It was a most extraordinary\r\npilgrimage for a most extraordinary purpose! And yet upon this plea we\r\njustified our right of carrying off its inhabitants. The offence alleged\r\nnext was witchcraft. What a reproach it was to lend ourselves to this\r\nsuperstition!--Yes: we stood by; we heard the trial; we knew the crime\r\nto be impossible; and that the accused must be innocent: but we waited\r\nin patient silence for his condemnation; and then we lent our friendly\r\naid to the police of the country, by buying the wretched convict, with\r\nall his family; whom, for the benefit of Africa, we carried away also\r\ninto perpetual slavery.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the situation of the slaves in their transportation, he\r\nknew not how to give the House a more correct idea of the horrors of it,\r\nthan by referring them to the printed section of the slave-ship; where\r\nthe eye might see what the tongue must fall short in describing. On this\r\ndismal part of the subject he would not dwell. He would only observe,\r\nthat the acts of barbarity, related of the slave-captains in these\r\nvoyages, were so extravagant, that they had been attributed in some\r\ninstances to insanity. But was not this the insanity of arbitrary power?\r\nWho ever read the facts recorded of Nero without suspecting he was mad?\r\nWho would not be apt to impute insanity to Caligula--or Domitian--or\r\nCaracalla--or Commodus--or Heliogabalus? Here were six Roman emperors,\r\nnot connected in blood, nor by descent, who, each of them, possessing\r\narbitrary power, had been so distinguished for cruelty, that nothing\r\nshort of insanity could be imputed to them. Was not the insanity of the\r\nmasters of slave-ships to be accounted for on the same principles?\r\n\r\nOf the slaves in the West Indies it had been said, that they were taken\r\nfrom a worse state to a better. An honourable member, Mr. W. Smith, had\r\nquoted some instances out of the evidence to the contrary. He also would\r\nquote one or two others. A slave under hard usage had run away. To\r\nprevent a repetition of the offence his owner sent for his surgeon, and\r\ndesired him to cut off the man's leg. The surgeon refused. The owner, to\r\nrender it a matter of duty in the surgeon, broke it. \"Now,\" says he,\r\n\"you must cut it off; or the man will die.\" We might console ourselves,\r\nperhaps, that this happened in a French island; but he would select\r\nanother instance, which had happened in one of our own. Mr. Ross heard\r\nthe shrieks of a female issuing from an out-house; and so piercing, that\r\nhe determined to me what was going on. On looking in he perceived a\r\nyoung female tied up to a beam by her wrists, entirely naked, and in the\r\nact of involuntary writhing and swinging; while the author of her\r\ntorture was standing below her with a lighted torch in his hand, which\r\nhe applied to all the parts of her body as it approached him. What crime\r\nthis miserable woman had perpetrated he knew not; but the human mind\r\ncould not conceive a crime warranting such a punishment.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to see that these tales affected the House. Would they then\r\nsanction enormities, the bare recital of which made them shudder? Let\r\nthem remember that humanity did not consist in a squeamish ear. It did\r\nnot consist in shrinking and starting at such tales as these; but in a\r\ndisposition of the heart to remedy the evils they unfolded. Humanity\r\nbelonged rather to the mind than to the nerves. But, if so, it should\r\nprompt men to charitable exertion. Such exertion was necessary in the\r\npresent case. It was necessary for the credit of our jurisprudence at\r\nhome, and our character abroad. For what would any man think of our\r\njustice, who should see another hanged for a crime, which would be\r\ninnocence itself, if compared with those enormities, which were allowed\r\nin Africa and the West Indies under the sanction of the British\r\nparliament?\r\n\r\nIt had been said, however, in justification of the trade, that the\r\nAfricans were less happy at home than in the Islands. But what right had\r\nwe to be judges of their condition? They would tell us a very different\r\ntale, if they were asked. But it was ridiculous to say, that we bettered\r\ntheir condition, when we dragged them from everything dear in life to\r\nthe most abject state of slavery.\r\n\r\nOne argument had been used, which for a subject so grave was the most\r\nridiculous he had ever heard. Mr. Alderman Watson had declared the Slave\r\nTrade to be necessary on account of its connexion with our fisheries.\r\nBut what was this but an acknowledgment of the manner, in which these\r\nmiserable beings, were treated? The trade was to be kept up, with all\r\nits enormities, in order that there might be persons to consume the\r\nrefuse fish from Newfoundland, which was too bad for anybody else to\r\neat.\r\n\r\nIt had been said that England ought not to abolish the Slave Trade,\r\nunless other nations would also give it up. But what kind of morality\r\nwas this? The Trade was defensible upon no other principle than that of\r\na highwayman. Great Britain could not keep it upon these terms. Mere\r\ngain was not a motive for a great country to rest on, as a justification\r\nof any measure. Honour was its superior; and justice was superior to\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the emancipation of those in slavery, he coincided with\r\nMr. Wilberforce and Mr. Pitt; and upon this principle, that it might be\r\nas dangerous to give freedom at once to a man used to slavery, as, in\r\nthe case of a man who had never seen day-light, to expose him all at\r\nonce to the full glare of a meridian sun.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the intellect and sensibility of the Africans, it was\r\npride only, which suggested a difference between them and ourselves.\r\nThere was a remarkable instance to the point in the evidence, and which\r\nhe would quote. In one of the slave-ships was a person of consequence; a\r\nman, once high in a military station, and with a mind not insensible to\r\nthe eminence of his rank. He had been taken captive and sold; and was\r\nthen in the hold, confined promiscuously with the rest. Happening in the\r\nnight to fall asleep, he dreamed that he was in his own country; high in\r\nhonour and command; caressed by his family and friends; waited on by his\r\ndomestics; and surrounded with all his former comforts in life. But\r\nawaking suddenly, and finding where he was, he was heard to burst into\r\nthe loudest groans and lamentations on the miserable contrast of his\r\npresent state; mixed with the meanest of his subjects; and subjected to\r\nthe insolence of wretches a thousand times lower than himself in every\r\nkind of endowment. He appealed to the House, whether this was not as\r\nmoving a picture of the miserable effects of the Slave Trade, as could\r\nbe well imagined. There was one way, by which they might judge of it.\r\nLet them make the case their own. This was the Christian rule of\r\njudging; and, having mentioned Christianity, he was sorry to find that\r\nany should suppose, that it had given countenance to such a system of\r\noppression. So far was this from being the case, that he thought it one\r\nof the most splendid triumphs of this religion, that it had caused\r\nslavery to be so generally abolished on its appearance in the world. It\r\nhad done this by teaching us, among other beautiful precepts, that, in\r\nthe sight of their Maker, all mankind were equal. Its influence appeared\r\nto have been more powerful in this respect than that of all the ancient\r\nsystems of philosophy; though even in these, in point of theory, we\r\nmight trace great liberality and consideration for human rights. Where\r\ncould be found finer sentiments of liberty than in Demosthenes and\r\nCicero? Where bolder assertions of the rights of mankind, than in\r\nTacitus and Thucydides? But, alas! these were the holders of slaves: It\r\nwas not so with those who had been converted to Christianity. He knew,\r\nhowever, that what he had been ascribing to Christianity had been\r\nimputed by others to the advances which philosophy had made. Each of the\r\ntwo parties took the merit to itself. The philosopher gave it to\r\nphilosophy, and the divine to religion. He should not, then, dispute\r\nwith either of them; but, as both coveted the praise, why should they\r\nnot emulate each other by promoting this improvement in the condition of\r\nthe human race?\r\n\r\nHe would now conclude by declaring, that the whole country, indeed the\r\nwhole civilized world, must rejoice that such a bill as the present had\r\nbeen moved for, not merely as a matter of humanity, but as an act of\r\njustice; for he would put humanity out of the case. Could it be called\r\nhumanity to forbear committing murder? Exactly upon this ground did the\r\nmotion stand; being strictly a question of national justice. He thanked\r\nMr. Wilberforce for having pledged himself so strongly to pursue his\r\nobject till it was accomplished; and, as for himself, he declared, that,\r\nin whatever situation he might ever be, he would use his warmest efforts\r\nfor the promotion of this righteous cause.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley (the member for Lancashire) rose, and declared that, when he\r\ncame into the house, he intended to vote against the abolition; but that\r\nthe impression made both on his feelings and on his understanding was\r\nsuch, that he could not persist in his resolution. He was now convinced\r\nthat the entire abolition of the Slave Trade was called for equally by\r\nsound policy and justice. He thought it right and fair to avow manfully\r\nthis change in his opinion. The abolition, ho was sure, could not long\r\nfail of being carried. The arguments for it were irresistible.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Mr. Ryder said that he came to the house not exactly in\r\nthe same circumstances as Mr. Stanley, but very undecided on the\r\nsubject. He was, however, so strongly convinced by the arguments he had\r\nheard, that he was become equally earnest for the abolition.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith (member for Pontefract) said, that he should not trouble the\r\nHouse, at so late an hour, further than to enter his protest, in the\r\nmost solemn manner, against this trade, which he considered as most\r\ndisgraceful to the country, and contrary to all the principles of\r\njustice and religion.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner declared himself against the total, immediate, and\r\nunqualified abolition, which he thought would wound at least the\r\nprejudices of the West Indians, and might do mischief; but a gradual\r\nabolition should have his hearty support.\r\n\r\nMajor Scott declared there was no member in the house, who would give a\r\nmore independent vote upon this question than himself. He had no concern\r\neither in the African or West Indian trades; but in the present state of\r\nthe finances of the country, he thought it would be a dangerous\r\nexperiment to risk any one branch of our foreign commerce. As far as\r\nregulation would go, he would join in the measure.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke said he would use but few words. He declared that he had for a\r\nlong time had his mind drawn towards this great subject. He had even\r\nprepared a bill for the regulation of the trade, conceiving at that time\r\nthat the immediate abolition of it was a thing hardly to be hoped for;\r\nbut when he found that Mr. Wilberforce had seriously undertaken the\r\nwork, and that his motion was for the abolition, which he approved much\r\nmore than his own, he had burnt his papers; and made an offering of them\r\nin honour of this nobler proposition, much in the same manner as we\r\nread, that the curious books were offered up and burnt at the approach\r\nof the Gospel. He highly applauded the confessions of Mr. Stanley and\r\nMr. Ryder. It would be a glorious tale for them to tell their\r\nconstituents, that it was impossible for them, however prejudiced, if\r\nsent to hear, discussion in that House, to avoid surrendering up their\r\nhearts and judgments at the shrine of reason.\r\n\r\nMr. Drake said, that he would oppose the abolition to the utmost. We\r\nhad, by a want of prudent conduct, lost America. The House should be\r\naware of being carried away by the meteors with which they had been\r\ndazzled. The leaders, it was true, were for the abolition; but the minor\r\norators, the dwarfs, the pigmies, he trusted, would that night carry the\r\nquestion against them. The property of the West Indians was at stake;\r\nand, though men might be generous with their own property, they should\r\nnot be so with the property of others.\r\n\r\nLord Sheffield reprobated the overbearing language which had been used\r\nby some gentlemen towards others, who differed in opinion from them on a\r\nsubject of so much difficulty as the present. He protested against a\r\ndebate, in which he could trace nothing like reason; but, on the\r\ncontrary, downright phrensy, raised perhaps by the most extraordinary\r\neloquence. The abolition, as proposed, was impracticable. He denied the\r\nright of the legislature to pass a law for it. He warned the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer to beware of the day, on which the bill should pass, as\r\nthe worst he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nMr. Milnes declared, that he adopted all those expressions against the\r\nSlave Trade, which had been thought so harsh; and that the opinion of\r\nthe noble lord had been turned in consequence of having become one of\r\nthe members for Bristol. He quoted a passage from Lord Sheffield's\r\npamphlet; and insisted that the separation of families in the West\r\nIndies, there complained of by himself, ought to have compelled him to\r\ntake the contrary side of the question.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilberforce made a short reply to some arguments in the course of\r\nthe debate; after which, at half-past three in the morning, the House\r\ndivided. There appeared for Mr. Wilberforce's motion eighty-eight, and\r\nagainst it one hundred and sixty-three; so that it was lost by a\r\nmajority of seventy-five votes.\r\n\r\nBy this unfavourable division the great contest, in which we had been so\r\nlong engaged, was decided. We were obliged to give way to superior\r\nnumbers. Our fall, however, grievous as it was, was rendered more\r\ntolerable by the circumstance of having been prepared to expect it. It\r\nwas rendered more tolerable, also, by other considerations; for we had\r\nthe pleasure of knowing, that we had several of the most distinguished\r\ncharacters in the kingdom, and almost all the splendid talents of the\r\nHouse of Commons[A], in our favour. We knew, too, that the question had\r\nnot been carried against us either by evidence or by argument; but that\r\nwe were the victims of the accidents and circumstances of the times. And\r\nas these considerations comforted us, when we looked forward to future\r\noperations on this great question, so we found great consolation as to\r\nthe past, in believing, that, unless human constitutions were stronger\r\nthan they really were, we could not have done more than we had done\r\ntowards the furtherance of the cause.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It is a pity that no perfect list was ever made of this or\r\nof any other division in the House of Commons on this subject. I can\r\ngive, however, the names of the following, members, as having voted for\r\nMr.  Wilberforce's motion at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt,           Lord Bayham,           Mr. Duncombe,\r\nMr. Fox,            Lord Arden,            Mr. Martin,\r\nMr. Burke,          Lord Carysfort,        Mr. Milnes,\r\nMr. Grey,           Lord Muncaster,        Mr. Steele,\r\nMr. Windham,        Lord Barnard,          Mr. Coke,\r\nMr. Sheridan,       Lord North,            Mr. Eliott,\r\nMr. Whitbread,      Lord Euston,           Mr. Montagu,\r\nMr. Courtenay,      General Burgoyne,      Mr. Bastard,\r\nMr. Francis,        Hon.

It was the most impressive I ever attended. The looks of all\r\nbespoke the feelings of their hearts. Little was said previously to the\r\nopening of the business; and, after it was opened, it was conducted with\r\na kind of solemn dignity, which became the occasion. The committee, in\r\nthe course of its deliberations, came to the following resolutions:--\r\n\r\nThat the thanks of this committee be respectfully given to the\r\nillustrious minority of the House of Commons, who lately stood forth the\r\nassertors of British justice and humanity, and the enemies of a traffic\r\nin the blood of man.\r\n\r\nThat our acknowledgments are particularly due to William Wilberforce,\r\nEsq., for his unwearied exertions to remove this opprobrium of our\r\nnational character; and to the right honourable William Pitt, and the\r\nright honourable Charles James Fox, for their virtuous and dignified\r\nco-operation in the same cause.\r\n\r\nThat the solemn declarations of these gentlemen, and of Matthew Montagu\r\nand William Smith, Esqrs., that they will not relinquish, but with life,\r\ntheir struggle for the abolition of the Slave Trade, are not only highly\r\nhonourable to themselves as Britons, as statesmen, and as Christians,\r\nbut must eventually, as the light of evidence shall be more and more\r\ndiffused, be seconded by the good wishes of every man not immediately\r\ninterested in the continuance of that detestable commerce.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, that anticipating the opposition they should have to sustain\r\nfrom persons trained to a familiarity with the rapine and desolation\r\nnecessarily attendant on the Slave Trade, and sensible, also, of the\r\nprejudices which implicitly arise from long-established usages, this\r\ncommittee consider the late decision in the House of Commons as a delay,\r\nrather than a defeat. In addressing a free and enlightened nation on a\r\nsubject, in which its justice, its humanity, and its wisdom are\r\ninvolved, they cannot despair of final success; and they do hereby,\r\nunder an increasing conviction of the excellence of their cause, and in\r\nconformity to the distinguished examples before them, renew their firm\r\nprotestation, that they will never desist from appealing to their\r\ncountrymen, till the commercial intercourse with Africa shall cease to\r\nbe polluted with the blood of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were published, and they were followed by a suitable\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nThe committee, in order to strengthen themselves for the prosecution of\r\ntheir great work, elected Sir William Dolben, Bart., Henry Thornton,\r\nLewis Alexander Grant, and Matthew Montagu, Esqrs., who were members of\r\nparliament, and Truman Harford, Josiah Wedgewood, jun., Esq., and John\r\nClarkson, Esq., of the royal navy, as members of their own body; and\r\nthey elected the Rev. Archdeacon Plymley (afterwards Corbett) an\r\nhonorary and corresponding member, in consequence of the great services\r\nwhich he had rendered their cause in the shires of Hereford and Salop,\r\nand the adjacent counties of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe several committees, established in the country, on receiving the\r\nresolutions and report as before mentioned, testified their sympathy in\r\nletters of condolence to that of London on the late melancholy occasion;\r\nand expressed their determination to support it as long as any vestiges\r\nof this barbarous traffic should remain.\r\n\r\nAt length the session ended; and though, in the course of it, the\r\nafflicting loss of the general question had occurred, there was yet an\r\nattempt made by the abolitionists in parliament, which met with a better\r\nfate. The Sierra Leone Company received the sanction of the Legislature.\r\nThe object of this institution was to colonize a small portion of the\r\ncoast of Africa. They, who were to settle there, were to have no concern\r\nin the Slave Trade, but to discourage it as much as possible. They were\r\nto endeavour to establish a new species of commerce, and to promote\r\ncultivation in its neighborhood by free labour. The persons more\r\ngenerally fixed upon for colonists, were such Negroes, with their wives\r\nand families, as chose to abandon their habitations in Nova Scotia.\r\nThese had followed the British arms in America; and had been settled\r\nthere, as a reward for their services, by the British government. My\r\nbrother, just mentioned to have been chosen a member of the committee,\r\nand who had essentially served the great cause of the abolition on many\r\noccasions, undertook a visit to Nova Scotia, to see if those in question\r\nwere willing to undergo the change; and in that case to provide\r\ntransports, and conduct them to Sierra Leone. This object he\r\naccomplished. He embarked more than eleven hundred persons in fifteen\r\nvessels, of all which he took the command. On landing them he became the\r\nfirst Governor of the new colony. Having laid the foundation of it, he\r\nreturned to England; when a successor was appointed. From that time many\r\nunexpected circumstances, but particularly devastations by the French in\r\nthe beginning of the war, took place, which contributed to ruin the\r\ntrading company which was attached to it. It is pleasing, however, to\r\nreflect, that though the object of the institution, as far as mercantile\r\nprofit was concerned, thus failed, the other objects belonging to it\r\nwere promoted. Schools, places of worship, agriculture, and the habits\r\nof civilized life were established. Sierra Leone, therefore, now\r\npresents itself as the medium of civilization for Africa. And, in this\r\nlatter point of view, it is worth all the treasure which has been lost\r\nin supporting it; for the Slave Trade, which was the great obstacle to\r\nthis civilization, being now happily abolished, there is a metropolis,\r\nconsisting of some hundreds of persons, from which may issue the seeds\r\nof reformation to this injured continent; and which, when sown, may be\r\nexpected to grow into fruit without interruption. New schools may be\r\ntransplanted from thence into the interior. Teachers, and travellers on\r\ndiscovery, may be sent from thence in various directions, who may return\r\nto it occasionally as to their homes. The natives, too, able now to\r\ntravel in safety, may resort to it from various parts. They may see the\r\nimprovements which are going on from time to time. They may send their\r\nchildren to it for education; and thus it may become the medium[A] of a\r\ngreat intercourse between England and Africa, to the benefit of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: To promote this desirable end an association took place\r\nlast year, called The African Institution, under the patronage of the\r\nDuke of Gloucester, as president, and of the Mends to the African cause,\r\nparticularly of such as were in parliament, and as belonged to the\r\ncommittee for the abolition of the Slave Trade.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n--Continuation from July 1791 to July 1792.--Author travels round the\r\nkingdom again; object of his journey.--People begin to leave off the\r\nuse of sugar; to form committees; and to send petitions to\r\nParliament.--Motion made in the House of Commons for the immediate\r\nabolition of the trade; Debates upon it; Abolition resolved upon, but\r\nnot to commence till 1796.--Resolution taken to the Lords; latter\r\ndetermine upon hearing evidence; Evidence at length introduced;\r\nfurther hearing of it postponed to the next session.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defeat which we had just sustained, was a matter of great triumph to\r\nour opponents. When they considered the majority in the House of Commons\r\nin their favour, they viewed the resolutions of the committee, which\r\nhave been detailed, as the last spiteful effort of a vanquished and\r\ndying animal, and they supposed that they had consigned the question to\r\neternal sleep. The committee, however, were too deeply attached to the\r\ncause, vanquished as they were, to desert it; and they knew, also, too\r\nwell the barometer of public feeling, and the occasion of its\r\nfluctuations, to despair. In the year 1787, the members of the House of\r\nCommons, as well as the people, were enthusiastic in behalf of the\r\nabolition of the trade. In the year 1788, the fair enthusiasm of the\r\nformer began to fade. In 1789, it died. In 1790, prejudice started up as\r\na noxious weed in its place. In 1791, this prejudice arrived at its\r\ngrowth. But to what were these changes owing? To delay; during which the\r\nmind, having been gradually led to the question as a commercial, had\r\nbeen gradually taken from it as a moral object. But it was possible to\r\nrestore the mind to its proper place. Add to which, that the nation had\r\nnever deserted the cause during this whole period.\r\n\r\nIt is much to the honour of the English people, that they should have\r\ncontinued to feel for the existence of an evil which was so far removed\r\nfrom their sight. But at this moment their feelings began to be\r\ninsupportable. Many of them resolved, as soon as parliament had rejected\r\nthe bill, to abstain from the use of West Indian produce. In this state\r\nof things, a pamphlet, written by William Bell Crafton, of Tewksbury,\r\nand called _A Sketch of the Evidence, with a Recommendation on the\r\nSubject to the serious Attention of People in general_, made its\r\nappearance; and another followed it, written by William Fox, of London,\r\n_On the Propriety of abstaining from West India Sugar and Rum_. These\r\npamphlets took the same ground. They inculcated abstinence from these\r\narticles as a moral duty; they inculcated it as a peaceable and\r\nconstitutional measure; and they laid before the reader a truth which\r\nwas sufficiently obvious, that, if each would abstain, the people would\r\nhave a complete remedy for this enormous evil in their own power.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were going on, it devolved upon me to arrange all the\r\nevidence on the part of the abolition under proper heads, and to abridge\r\nit into one volume. It was intended that a copy of this should be sent\r\ninto different towns of the kingdom, that all might know, if possible,\r\nthe horrors (as far as the evidence contained them) of this execrable\r\ntrade; and as it was possible that these copies might lie in the places\r\nwhere they were sent, without a due attention to their contents, I\r\nresolved, with the approbation of the committee, to take a journey, and\r\nfor no other purpose than personally to recommend that they might be\r\nread.\r\n\r\nThe books, having been printed, were despatched before me. Of this tour\r\nI shall give the reader no other account than that of the progress of\r\nthe remedy, which the people were then taking into their own hands. And\r\nfirst I may observe, that there was no town, through which I passed, in\r\nwhich there was not some one individual who had left off the use of\r\nsugar. In the smaller towns there were from ten to fifty by estimation,\r\nand in the larger from two to five hundred, who made this sacrifice to\r\nvirtue. These were of all ranks and parties. Rich and poor, churchmen\r\nand dissenters, had adopted the measure. Even grocers had left off\r\ntrading in the article, in some places. In gentlemen's families, where\r\nthe master had set the example, the servants had often voluntarily\r\nfollowed it; and even children, who were capable of understanding the\r\nhistory of the sufferings of the Africans, excluded, with the most\r\nvirtuous resolution, the sweets, to which they had been accustomed, from\r\ntheir lips. By the best computation I was able to make from notes taken\r\ndown in my journey, no fewer than three hundred thousand persons had\r\nabandoned the use of sugar.\r\n\r\nHaving travelled over Wales, and two-thirds of England, I found it would\r\nbe impossible to visit Scotland on the same errand. I had already, by\r\nmoving upwards and downwards in parallel lines, and by intersecting\r\nthese in the same manner, passed over six thousand miles. By the best\r\ncalculation I could make, I had yet two thousand to perform. By means of\r\nalmost incessant journeyings night and day, I had suffered much in my\r\nhealth. My strength was failing daily. I wrote, therefore, to the\r\ncommittee on this subject; and they communicated immediately with Dr.\r\nDickson, who, on being applied to, visited Scotland in my stead. He\r\nconsulted first with the committee at Edinburgh relative to the\r\ncirculation of the Abridgment of the Evidence. He then pursued his\r\njourney, and, in conjunction with the unwearied efforts of Mr. Campbel\r\nHaliburton, rendered essential service to the cause for this part of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nOn my return to London, I found that the committee had taken into their\r\nown body T.F. Forster, B.M. Forster, and James West, Esqrs., as members;\r\nand that they had elected Hercules Boss, Esq., an honorary and\r\ncorresponding member, in consequence of the handsome manner in which he\r\nhad come forward as an evidence, and of the peculiar benefit which had\r\nresulted from his testimony to the cause.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the two journeys by Dr. Dickson and myself were soon\r\nvisible. The people could not bear the facts, which had been disclosed\r\nto them by the Abridgment of the Evidence. They were not satisfied, many\r\nof them, with the mere abstinence from sugar; but began to form\r\ncommittees to correspond with that of London. The first of these\r\nappeared at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, so early as the month of October. It\r\nconsisted of the Rev. William Turner, as chairman, and of Robert\r\nOrmston, William Batson, Henry, Taylor, Ralph Bambridge, George Brown,\r\nHadwen Bragg, David Sutton, Anthony Clapham, George Richardson, and\r\nEdward Prowit. It received a valuable addition afterwards by the\r\nadmission of many others. The second was established at Nottingham. The\r\nRev. Jeremiah Bigsby became the president, and the Revs. G. Walker and\r\nJ. Smith, and Messrs. Dennison, Evans, Watson, Hart, Storer, Bott,\r\nHawkesley, Pennington, Wright, Frith, Hall, and Wakefield, the\r\ncommittee. The third was formed at Glasgow, under the patronage of David\r\nDale, Scott Montcrieff, Robert Graham, Professor Millar, and others.\r\nOther committees started up in their turn. At length public meetings\r\nbegan to take place, and after this petitions to be sent to parliament;\r\nand these so generally, that there was not a day for three months,\r\nSundays excepted, in which five or six were not resolved upon in some\r\nplaces or other in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nOf the enthusiasm of the nation at this time none can form an opinion\r\nbut they who witnessed it. There never was perhaps a season when so much\r\nvirtuous feeling pervaded all ranks. Great pains were taken by\r\ninterested persons in many places to prevent public meetings. But no\r\nefforts could avail. The current ran with such strength and rapidity,\r\nthat it was impossible to stem it. In the city of London a remarkable\r\ninstance occurred. The livery had been long waiting for the common\r\ncouncil to begin a petition; but the lord mayor and several of the\r\naldermen stifled it. The former, indignant at this conduct, insisted\r\nupon a common hall. A day was appointed; and, though the notice given of\r\nit was short, the assemblage was greater than had ever been remembered\r\non any former occasion. Scarcely a liveryman was absent, unless sick, or\r\npreviously engaged. The petition, when introduced, was opposed by those\r\nwho had prevented it in the common council. But their voices were\r\ndrowned amidst groans and hissings. It was shortly after carried; and it\r\nhad not been signed more than half an hour, before it was within the\r\nwalls of the House of Commons. The reason of this extraordinary despatch\r\nwas, that it had been kept back by intrigue so late, that the very hour\r\nin which it was delivered to the House, was that in which Mr.\r\nWilberforce was to make his new motion.\r\n\r\nAnd as no petitions were ever more respectable than those presented on\r\nthis occasion, as far as they breathed the voice of the people, and as\r\nfar as they were founded on a knowledge of the object which they\r\nsolicited, so none were ever more numerous, as far as we have any record\r\nof such transactions. Not fewer than three hundred and ten were\r\npresented from England; one hundred and eighty-seven from Scotland; and\r\ntwenty from Wales. Two other petitions also for the abolition came from\r\nEngland, but they were too late for delivery. On the other side of the\r\nquestion, one was presented from the town of Reading for regulation, in\r\nopposition to that for abolition from the same place. There were also\r\nfour against abolition. The first of these was from certain persons at\r\nDerby, in opposition to the other from that town. The second was from\r\nStephen Fuller, Esq., as agent for Jamaica. The third from J. Dawson,\r\nEsq., a slave-merchant at Liverpool. And the fourth from the merchants,\r\nplanters, mortgagees, annuitants, and others concerned in the West\r\nIndian colonies. Taking in all these statements, the account stood\r\nthus:--for regulation there was one; against all abolition there were\r\nfour; and for the total abolition of the trade five hundred and\r\nnineteen.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of April Mr. Wilberforce moved the order of the day; which\r\nhaving been agreed to, Sir William Dolben was put into the chair.\r\n\r\nHe then began by soliciting the candid attention of the West Indians to\r\nwhat he was going to deliver to the House. However others might have\r\ncensured them indiscriminately, he had always himself made a distinction\r\nbetween them and their system. It was the latter only which he\r\nreprobated. If aristocracy had been thought a worse form of government\r\nthan monarchy, because the people had many tyrants instead of one, how\r\nobjectionable must be that form of it, which existed in our colonies!\r\nArbitrary power could be bought there by any one, who could buy a slave.\r\nThe fierceness of it was doubtless restrained by an elevation of mind in\r\nmany, as arising from a consciousness of superior rank and consequence:\r\nbut, alas! it was too often exercised there by the base and vulgar. The\r\nmore liberal, too, of the planters were not resident upon their estates.\r\nHence a promiscuous censure of them would be unjust, though their system\r\nwould undoubtedly be odious.\r\n\r\nAs for the cure of this monstrous evil, he had shown, last year, that\r\ninternal regulations would not produce it. These could have no effect,\r\nwhile the evidence of slaves was inadmissible. What would be the\r\nsituation of the bulk of the people of this country, if only gentlemen\r\nof five hundred a-year were admitted as evidences in our courts of law?\r\nNeither was the cure of it in the emancipation of the slaves. He did not\r\ndeny that he wished them this latter blessing. But, alas, in their\r\npresent degraded state, they were unfit for it! Liberty was the child of\r\nreason and order. It was, indeed, a plant of celestial growth, but the\r\nsoil must be prepared for its reception. He, who would see it flourish\r\nand bring forth its proper fruit, must not think it sufficient to let it\r\nshoot in unrestrained licentiousness. But if this inestimable blessing\r\nwas ever to be imparted to them, the cause must be removed, which\r\nobstructed its introduction. In short, no effectual remedy could be\r\nfound but in the abolition of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nHe then took a copious view of the advantages, which would arise both to\r\nthe master and to the slave, if this traffic were done away; and having\r\nrecapitulated and answered the different objections to such a measure,\r\nhe went to that part of the subject, in which he described himself to be\r\nmost interested.\r\n\r\nHe had shown, he said, last year, that Africa was exposed to all the\r\nhorrors of war; and that most of these wars had their origin in the\r\nSlave Trade. It was then said, in reply, that the natural barbarity of\r\nthe natives was alone sufficient to render their country a scene of\r\ncarnage. This was triumphantly instanced in the King of Dahomey. But his\r\nhonourable friend Lord Muncaster, then in the House, had proved in his\r\ninteresting publication, which had appeared since, called _Historical\r\nSketches of the Slave Trade, and of its Effects in Africa_, addressed to\r\nthe people of Great Britain, that the very cruelties of this king, on\r\nwhich so much stress had been laid, were committed by him in a war,\r\nwhich had been undertaken expressly to punish an adjacent people for\r\nhaving stolen some of his subjects and sold them for slaves.\r\n\r\nHe had shown, also, last year, that kings were induced to seize and sell\r\ntheir subjects, and individuals each other, in consequence of the\r\nexistence of the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nHe had shown, also, that the administration of justice was perverted, so\r\nas to become a fertile source of supply to this inhuman traffic; that\r\nevery crime was punished by slavery; that false accusations were made to\r\nprocure convicts; and that even the judges had a profit on the\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nHe had shown again, that many acts of violence were perpetrated by the\r\nEuropeans themselves. But he would now relate others which had happened\r\nsince. The captain of an English vessel, lying in the river Cameroons,\r\nsent his boat with three sailors and a slave to get water. A Black\r\ntrader seized the latter, and took him away. He alleged in his defence,\r\nthat the captain owed him goods to a greater amount than the value of\r\nthe slave; and that he would not pay him. This being told on board, the\r\ncaptain, and a part of his crew, who were compelled to blacken their\r\nnaked bodies that they might appear like the natives, went on shore at\r\nmidnight, armed with muskets and cutlasses. They fired on the trader's\r\ndwelling, and killed three of his children on the spot. The trader,\r\nbeing badly wounded, died while they were dragging him to the boat; and\r\nhis wife, being wounded also, died in half an hour after she was on\r\nboard the ship. Resistance having been made to these violent\r\nproceedings, some of the sailors were wounded, and one was killed.\r\n\r\nSome weeks after this affray, a chieftain of the name of Quarmo went on\r\nboard the same vessel to borrow some cutlasses and muskets. He was\r\ngoing, he said, into the country to make war; and the captain should\r\nhave half of his booty. So well understood were the practices of the\r\ntrade, that his request was granted. Quarmo, however, and his\r\nassociates, finding things favourable to their design, suddenly seized\r\nthe captain, threw him overboard, hauled him into their canoe, and\r\ndragged him to the shore; where another party of the natives, lying in\r\nambush, seized such of the crew as were absent from the ship. But how\r\ndid these savages behave, when they had these different persons in their\r\npower? Did they not instantly retaliate by murdering them all? No--they\r\nonly obliged the captain to give an order on the vessel to pay his\r\ndebts. This fact came out only two: months ago in a trial in the Court\r\nof Common Pleas--not in trial for piracy and murder, but in the trial of\r\na civil suit, instituted by some of the poor sailors, to whom the owners\r\nrefused their wages, because the natives, on account of the villainous\r\nconduct of their captain, had kept them from their vessel by detaining\r\nthem as prisoners on shore. This instance, he said, proved the dreadful\r\nnature of the Slave Trade, its cruelty, its perfidy, and its effect on\r\nthe Africans as well as on the Europeans, who carried it on. The cool\r\nmanner in which the transaction was conducted on both sides, showed that\r\nthese practices were not novel. It showed also the manner of doing\r\nbusiness in the trade. It must be remembered, too, that these\r\ntransactions were carrying on at the very time when the inquiry\r\nconcerning this trade was going forward in Parliament, and whilst the\r\nwitnesses of his opponents were strenuously denying not only the actual,\r\nbut the possible, existence of any such depredations.\r\n\r\nBut another instance happened only in August last. Six British ships,\r\nthe Thomas, Captain Philips; the Wasp, Captain Hutchinson; the Recovery,\r\nCaptain Kimber, of Bristol; the Martha, Captain Houston; the Betsey,\r\nCaptain Doyle; and the Amachree, (he believed,) Captain Lee, of\r\nLiverpool; were anchored off the town of Calabar. This place was the\r\nscene of a dreadful massacre about twenty years before. The captains of\r\nthese vessels, thinking that the natives asked too much for their\r\nslaves, held a consultation, how they should proceed; and agreed to fire\r\nupon the town unless their own terms were complied with. On a certain\r\nevening they notified their determination to the traders; and told them,\r\nthat, if they continued obstinate, they would put it into execution the\r\nnext morning. In this they kept their word. They brought sixty-six guns\r\nto bear upon the town; and fired on it for three hours. Not a shot was\r\nreturned. A canoe then went to offer terms of accommodation. The parties\r\nhowever not agreeing, the firing recommenced; more damage was done; and\r\nthe natives were forced into submission. There were no certain accounts\r\nof their loss. Report said that fifty were killed; but some were seen\r\nlying badly wounded, and others in the agonies of death by those who\r\nwent afterwards on shore.\r\n\r\nHe would now say a few words relative to the Middle Passage, principally\r\nto show, that regulation could not effect a cure of the evil there. Mr.\r\nIsaac Wilson had stated in his evidence, that the ship, in which he\r\nsailed, only three years ago, was of three hundred and seventy tons; and\r\nthat she carried six hundred and two slaves. Of these she lost one\r\nhundred and fifty-five. There were three or four other vessels in\r\ncompany with her, and which belonged to the same owners. One of these\r\ncarried four hundred and fifty, and buried two hundred; another carried\r\nfour hundred and sixty-six, and buried seventy-three; another five\r\nhundred and forty-six, and burled one hundred and fifty-eight; and from\r\nthe four together, after the landing of their cargoes, two hundred and\r\ntwenty died. He fell in with another vessel, which had lost three\r\nhundred and sixty-two; but the number, which had been bought, was not\r\nspecified. Now if to these actual deaths, during and immediately after\r\nthe voyage, we were to add the subsequent loss in the seasoning, and to\r\nconsider that this would be greater than ordinary in cargoes which were\r\nlanded in such a sickly state, we should find a mortality, which, if it\r\nwere only general for a few months, would entirely depopulate the globe.\r\n\r\nBut he would advert to what Mr. Wilson said, when examined, as a\r\nsurgeon, as to the causes of these losses, and particularly on board his\r\nown ship, where he had the means of ascertaining them. The substance of\r\nhis reply was this--That most of the slaves laboured under a fixed\r\nmelancholy, which now and then broke out into lamentations and plaintive\r\nsongs, expressive of the loss of their relations, friends, and country.\r\nSo powerfully did this sorrow operate, that many of them attempted in\r\nvarious ways to destroy themselves, and three actually effected it.\r\nOthers obstinately refused to take sustenance; and when the whip and\r\nother violent means were used to compel them to eat, they looked up in\r\nthe face of the officer, who unwillingly executed this painful task, and\r\nsaid, with a smile, in their own language, \"Presently we shall be no\r\nmore.\" This, their unhappy state of mind, produced a general languor and\r\ndebility, which were increased in many instances by an unconquerable\r\naversion to food, arising partly from sickness, and partly, to use the\r\nlanguage of the slave-captains, from sulkiness. These causes naturally\r\nproduced the flux. The contagion spread; several were carried off daily;\r\nand the disorder, aided by so many powerful auxiliaries, resisted the\r\npower of medicine. And it is worth while to remark, that these grievous\r\nsufferings were not owing either to want of care on the part of the\r\nowners, or to any negligence or harshness of the captain; for Mr. Wilson\r\ndeclared, that his ship was as well fitted out, and the crew and slaves\r\nas well treated, as anybody could reasonably expect.\r\n\r\nHe would now go to another ship. That, in which Mr. Claxton sailed as a\r\nsurgeon, afforded a repetition of all the horrid circumstances which had\r\nbeen described. Suicide was attempted, and effected; and the same\r\nbarbarous expedients were adopted to compel the slaves to continue an\r\nexistence, which they considered as too painful to be endured. The\r\nmortality, also, was as great. And yet here, again, the captain was in\r\nno wise to blame. But this vessel had sailed since the regulating act.\r\nNay, even in the last year, the deaths on shipboard would be found to\r\nhave been between ten and eleven per cent, on the whole number exported.\r\nIn truth, the House could not reach the cause of this mortality by all\r\ntheir regulations. Until they could cure a broken heart--until they\r\ncould legislate for the affections, and bind by their statutes the\r\npassions and feelings of the mind, their labour would be in vain.\r\n\r\nSuch were the evils of the Passage. But evils were conspicuous\r\neverywhere in this trade. Never was there, indeed, a system so replete\r\nwith wickedness and cruelty. To whatever part of it we turned our eyes,\r\nwhether to Africa, the Middle Passage, or the West Indies, we could find\r\nno comfort, no satisfaction, no relief. It was the gracious ordinance of\r\nProvidence, both in the natural and moral world, that good should often\r\narise out of evil. Hurricanes cleared the air; and the propagation of\r\ntruth was promoted by persecution, Pride, vanity, and profusion\r\ncontributed often; in their remoter consequences, to the happiness of\r\nmankind. In common, what was in itself evil and vicious, was permitted\r\nto carry along with it some circumstances of palliation. The Arab was\r\nhospitable; the robber brave. We did not necessarily find cruelty\r\nassociated with fraud, or meanness with injustice. But here the case was\r\nfar otherwise. It was the prerogative of this detested traffic to\r\nseparate from evil its concomitant good, and to reconcile discordant\r\nmischiefs. It robbed war of its generosity; it deprived peace of its\r\nsecurity: we saw in it the vices of polished society, without its\r\nknowledge or its comforts; and the evils of barbarism without its\r\nsimplicity. No age, no sex, no rank, no condition, was exempt from the\r\nfatal influence of this wide-wasting calamity. Thus it attained to the\r\nfullest measure of pure, unmixed, unsophisticated wickedness; and,\r\nscorning all competition and comparison, it stood without a rival in the\r\nsecure, undisputed, possession of its detestable preeminence.\r\n\r\nBut, after all this, wonderful to relate, this execrable traffic had\r\nbeen defended on the ground of benevolence! It had been said, that the\r\nslaves were captives and convicts, who, if we were not to carry them\r\naway, would be sacrificed, and many of them at the funerals of people of\r\nrank, according to the savage custom of Africa. He had shown, however,\r\nthat our supplies of slaves were obtained from other quarters than\r\nthese. But he would wave this consideration for the present. Had it not\r\nbeen acknowledged by his opponents that the custom of ransoming slaves\r\nprevailed in Africa? With respect to human sacrifices, he did not deny\r\nthat there might have been some instances of these; but they had not\r\nbeen proved to be more frequent than amongst other barbarous nations;\r\nand, where they existed, being acts of religion, they would not be\r\ndispensed with for the sake of commercial gain. In fact, they had\r\nnothing to do with the Slave Trade; only perhaps, if it were abolished,\r\nthey might, by means of the civilization which would follow, be done\r\naway.\r\n\r\nBut, exclusively of these sacrifices, it had been asserted, that it was\r\nkindness to the inhabitants to take them away from their own country.\r\nBut what said the historians of Africa, long before the question of the\r\nabolition was started? \"Axim,\" says Bosman, \"is cultivated, and abounds\r\nwith numerous large and beautiful villages: its inhabitants are\r\nindustriously employed in trade, fishing, or agriculture.\"--\"The\r\ninhabitants of Adom always expose large quantities of corn to sale,\r\nbesides what they want for their own use.\"--\"The people of Acron husband\r\ntheir grounds and time so well, that every year produces a plentiful\r\nharvest.\" Speaking of the Fetu country, he says,--\"Frequently, when\r\nwalking through it, I have seen it abound with fine well-built and\r\npopulous towns, agreeably enriched with vast quantities of corn and\r\ncattle, palm-wine, and oil. The inhabitants all apply themselves,\r\nwithout distinction, to agriculture; some sow corn; others press oil,\r\nand draw wine from the palm-trees.\"\r\n\r\nSmith, who was sent out by the royal African company in 1726, assures\r\nus, \"that the discerning natives account it their greatest unhappiness,\r\nthat they were ever visited by the Europeans. They say that we\r\nChristians introduced the traffic of slaves; and that before our coming\r\nthey lived in peace. But, say they, it is observable, wherever\r\nChristianity comes, there come swords and guns, and powder and ball,\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Europeans,\" says Bruce, \"are far from desiring to act as\r\npeace-makers among them. It would be too contrary to their interests;\r\nfor the only object of their wars is to carry off slaves; and, as these\r\nform the principal part of their traffic, they would be apprehensive of\r\ndrying up the source of it, were they to encourage the people to live\r\nwell together.\"\r\n\r\n\"The neighbourhood of the Damel and Tin keep them perpetually at war,\r\nthe benefit of which accrues to the Company, who buy all the prisoners\r\nmade on either side; and the more there are to sell, the greater is\r\ntheir profit; for the only end of their armaments is to make captives,\r\nto sell them to the white traders.\"\r\n\r\nArtus, of Dantzic, says, that in his time \"those liable to pay fines\r\nwere banished till the fine was paid; when they returned to their houses\r\nand possessions.\"\r\n\r\nBosman affirms, \"that formerly all crimes in Africa were compensated by\r\nfine or restitution, and, where restitution was impracticable, by\r\ncorporal punishment.\"\r\n\r\nMoore says, \"Since this trade has been used, all punishments have been\r\nchanged into slavery. There being an advantage in such condemnation,\r\nthey strain the crimes very hard, in order to get the benefit of selling\r\nthe criminal. Not only murder, theft, and adultery, are punished by\r\nselling the criminal for a slave, but every trifling crime is punished\r\nin the same manner.\"\r\n\r\nLoyer affirms that \"the King of Sain, on the least pretence, sells his\r\nsubjects for European goods. He is so tyrannically severe, that he makes\r\na whole village responsible for the fault of one inhabitant; and on the\r\nleast offence sells them all for slaves.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, he said, were the testimonies, not of persons whom he had\r\nsummoned; not of friends of the abolition; but of men who were\r\nthemselves, many of them, engaged in the Slave Trade. Other testimonies\r\nmight be added; but these were sufficient to refute the assertions of\r\nhis opponents, and to show the kind services we had done to Africa by\r\nthe introduction of this trade.\r\n\r\nHe would just touch upon the argument, so often repeated, that other\r\nnations would carry on the Slave Trade, if we abandoned it. But how did\r\nwe know this? Had not Denmark given a noble example to the contrary? She\r\nhad consented to abolish the trade in ten years; and had she not done\r\nthis, even though we, after an investigation for nearly five years, had\r\nourselves hung back? But what might not be expected, if we were to take\r\nup the cause in earnest; if we were to proclaim to all nations the\r\ninjustice of the trade, and to solicit their concurrence in the\r\nabolition of it! He hoped the representatives of the nation would not be\r\nless just than the people. The latter had stepped forward, and expressed\r\ntheir sense more generally by petitions, than in any instance in which\r\nthey had ever before interfered. To see this great cause thus triumphing\r\nover distinctions and prejudices was a noble spectacle. Whatever might\r\nbe said of our political divisions, such a sight had taught us that\r\nthere were subjects still beyond the reach of party; that there was a\r\npoint of elevation, where we ascended above the jarring of the\r\ndiscordant elements, which ruffled and agitated the vale below. In our\r\nordinary atmosphere clouds and vapours obscured the air, and we were the\r\nsport of a thousand conflicting winds and adverse currents; but here we\r\nmoved in a higher region, where all was pure and clear, and free from\r\nperturbation and discomposure:\r\n\r\n\r\n  As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,\r\n  Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm;\r\n  Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,\r\n  Eternal sunshine settles on its head.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere then, on this august eminence, he hoped we should build the Temple\r\nof Benevolence; that we should lay its foundation deep in Truth and\r\nJustice; and that we should inscribe upon its gates, \"Peace and Good\r\nWill to Men.\" Here we should offer the first-fruits of our benevolence,\r\nand endeavour to compensate, if possible, for the injuries we had\r\nbrought upon our fellow-men.\r\n\r\nHe would only now observe, that his conviction of the indispensable\r\nnecessity of immediately abolishing this trade remained as strong as\r\never. Let those who talked of allowing three or four years to the\r\ncontinuance of it, reflect on the disgraceful scenes which had passed\r\nlast year. As for himself, he would wash his hands of the blood which\r\nwould be spilled in this horrid interval. He could not, however, but\r\nbelieve, that the hour was come, when we should put a final period to\r\nthe existence of this cruel traffic. Should he unhappily be mistaken, he\r\nwould never desert the cause; but to the last moment of his life he\r\nwould exert his utmost powers in its support. He would now move, \"That\r\nit is the opinion of this committee, that the trade carried on by\r\nBritish subjects for the purpose of obtaining slaves on the coast of\r\nAfrica, ought to be abolished.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Baillie was in hopes that the friends of the abolition would have\r\nbeen contented with the innocent blood which had been already shed. The\r\ngreat island of St. Domingo had been torn to pieces by insurrections.\r\nThe most dreadful barbarities had been perpetrated there. In the year\r\n1789, the imports into it exceeded five millions sterling. The exports\r\nfrom it in the same year amounted to six millions; and the trade\r\nemployed three hundred thousand tons of shipping, and thirty thousand\r\nseamen. This fine island, thus advantageously situated, had been lost in\r\nconsequence of the agitation of the question of the Slave Trade. Surely\r\nso much mischief ought to have satisfied those who supported it; but\r\nthey required the total destruction of all the West Indian colonies,\r\nbelonging to Great Britain, to complete the ruin.\r\n\r\nThe honourable gentleman, who had just spoken, had dwelt upon the\r\nenormities of the Slave Trade. He was far from denying that many acts of\r\ninhumanity might accompany it; but as human nature was much the same\r\neverywhere, it would be unreasonable to expect among African traders, or\r\nthe inhabitants of our islands, a degree of perfection in morals, which\r\nwas not to be found in Great Britain itself. Would any man estimate the\r\ncharacter of the English nation by what was to be read in the records of\r\nthe Old Bailey? He himself, however, had lived sixteen years in the West\r\nIndies, and he could bear testimony to the general good usage of the\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nBefore the agitation of this impolitic question the slaves were\r\ncontented with their situation. There was a mutual confidence between\r\nthem and their masters: and this continued to be the case till the new\r\ndoctrines were broached. But now depots of arms were necessary on every\r\nestate; and the scene was totally reversed. Nor was their religious then\r\ninferior to their civil state. When the English took possession of\r\nGrenada, where his property lay, they found them baptized and instructed\r\nin the principles of the Roman Catholic faith. The priests of that\r\npersuasion had indeed been indefatigable in their vocation; so that\r\nimported Africans generally obtained within twelve months a tolerable\r\nidea of their religious duties. He had seen the slaves there go through\r\nthe public mass in a manner, and with a fervency, which would have done\r\ncredit to more civilized societies. But the case was now altered; for,\r\nexcept where the Moravians had been, there was no trace in our islands\r\nof an attention to their religious interests.\r\n\r\nIt had been said that their punishments were severe. There might be\r\ninstances of cruelty; but these were not general. Many of them were\r\nundoubtedly ill disposed; though not more, according to their number, on\r\na plantation, than in a regiment, or in a ship's crew. Had we never\r\nheard of seamen being flogged from ship to ship, or of soldiers dying in\r\nthe very act of punishment? Had we not also heard, even in this country\r\nof boasted liberty, of seamen being seized, and carried away, when\r\nreturning from distant voyages, after an absence of many years; and this\r\nwithout even being allowed to see their wives and families? As to\r\ndistressed objects, he maintained, that there was more wretchedness and\r\npoverty in St. Giles's, than in all the West Indian islands belonging to\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nHe would now speak of the African and West Indian trades. The imports\r\nand exports of these amounted to upwards of ten millions annually; and\r\nthey gave employment to three hundred thousand tons of shipping, and to\r\nabout twenty-five thousand seamen. These trades had been sanctioned by\r\nour ancestors in parliament. The acts for this purpose might be classed\r\nunder three heads. First, they were such as declared the colonies, and\r\nthe trade thereof, advantageous to Great Britain, and therefore entitled\r\nto her protection. Secondly, such as authorized, protected, and\r\nencouraged the trade to Africa, as advantageous in itself, and necessary\r\nto the welfare and existence of the sugar colonies: and, Thirdly, such\r\nas promoted and secured loans of money to the proprietors of the said\r\ncolonies, either from British subjects, or from foreigners. These\r\nacts[A], he apprehended, ought to satisfy every person of the legality\r\nand usefulness of these trades. They were enacted in reigns\r\ndistinguished for the production of great and enlightened characters. We\r\nheard then of no wild and destructive doctrines like the present. These\r\nwere reserved for this age of novelty and innovation. But he must remind\r\nthe House, that the inhabitants of our islands had as good a right to\r\nthe protection of their property, as the inhabitants of Great Britain.\r\nNor could it be diminished in any shape without full compensation. The\r\nproprietors of lands in the ceded islands, which were purchased of\r\ngovernment under specific conditions of settlement, ought to be\r\nindemnified. They also (of whom he was one), who had purchased the\r\nterritory granted by the crown to General Monkton, in the island, of St.\r\nVincent, ought to be indemnified also. The sale of this had gone on\r\nbriskly, till it was known that a plan was in agitation for the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade. Since that period, the original purchasers\r\nhad done little or nothing, and they had many hundred acres on hand,\r\nwhich would be of no value, if the present question was carried. In\r\nfact, they had a right to compensation. The planters generally spent\r\ntheir estates in this country. They generally educated their children in\r\nit. They had never been found seditious, or rebellious; and they\r\ndemanded of the Parliament of Great Britain that protection, which, upon\r\nthe principles of good faith, it was in duty bound to afford them in\r\ncommon with the rest of his majesty's loyal subjects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Here he quoted them specifically.]\r\n\r\nMr. Vaughan stated that, being a West Indian by birth, and connected\r\nwith the islands, he could speak from his own knowledge. In the early\r\npart of his life he was strongly in favour of the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade. He had been educated by Dr. Priestley, and the father of Mrs.\r\nBarbauld; who were both of them friends to that question. Their\r\nsentiments he had imbibed; but, although bred at the feet of Gamaliel,\r\nhe resolved to judge for himself, and he left England for Jamaica.\r\n\r\nHe found the situation of the slaves much better than he had imagined.\r\nSetting aside liberty, they were as well off as the poor in Europe. They\r\nhad little want of clothes or fuel; they had a house and garden found\r\nthem, were never imprisoned for debts, nor deterred from marrying\r\nthrough fear of being unable to support a family; their orphans and\r\nwidows were taken care of, as they themselves were when old and\r\ndisabled; they had medical attendance without expense; they had private\r\nproperty, which no master ever took from them; and they were resigned to\r\ntheir situation, and looked for nothing beyond it. Perhaps persons might\r\nhave been prejudiced by living in the towns, to which slaves were often\r\nsent for punishment; and where there were many small proprietors; or by\r\nseeing no negro otherwise than as belonging to the labouring poor; but\r\nthey appeared to him to want nothing but liberty; and it was only\r\noccasionally that they were abused.\r\n\r\nThere were two prejudices with respect to the colonies, which he would\r\nnotice. The first was, that cruel usage occasioned the inequality of\r\nbirths and deaths among the slaves. But did cruelty cause the excess of\r\ndeaths above births in the city of London? No--this excess had other\r\ncauses. So it had among the slaves. Of these more males were imported\r\nthan females: they were dissolute too in their morals; they had also\r\ndiseases peculiar to themselves. But in those islands where they nearly\r\nkept up their numbers, there was this difficulty, that the equality was\r\npreserved by the increase on one estate compensating for the decrease on\r\nanother. These estates, however, would not interchange their numbers;\r\nwhereas, where freedom prevailed, the free labourers circulated from one\r\nemployer to another, and appeared wherever they were wanted.\r\n\r\nThe second was, that all chastisement of the slaves was cruelty. But\r\nthis was not true. Their owners generally withdrew them from public\r\njustice; so that they, who would have been publicly executed elsewhere,\r\nwere often kept alive by their masters, and were found punished again\r\nand again for repeating their faults. Distributive justice occasioned\r\nmany punishments; as one slave was to be protected against every other\r\nslave: and, when one pilfered from another, then the master interfered.\r\nThese punishments were to be distinguished from such as arose from\r\nenforcing labour, or from the cruelty of their owners. Indeed he had\r\ngone over the islands, and he had seen but little ill usage. He had seen\r\nnone on the estate where he resided. The whip, the stocks, and\r\nconfinement, were all the modes of punishment he had observed in other\r\nplaces. Some slaves belonging to his father were peculiarly well off.\r\nThey saved money, and spent it in their own way.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all he had said, he allowed that there was room for\r\nimprovement; and particularly for instilling into the slaves the\r\nprinciples of religion. Where this should be realized, there would be\r\nless punishment, more work, more marriages, more issue, and more\r\nattachment to masters. Other improvements would be the establishment of\r\nmedical societies; the introduction of task-work; and grants of premiums\r\nand honorary distinctions both to fathers and mothers, according to the\r\nnumber of children which they should rear. Besides this, Negro evidence\r\nshould be allowed in the courts of law, it being left to the discretion\r\nof the court or jury to take or reject it, according to the nature of\r\nthe case. Cruel masters also should be kept in order in various ways.\r\nThey should he liable to have their slaves taken from them, and put in\r\ntrust. Every instrument of punishment should be banished, except the\r\nwhip. The number of lashes should be limited; and the punishment should\r\nnot be repeated till after intervals. These and other improvements\r\nshould be immediately adopted by the planters. The character of the\r\nexemplary among them was hurt by being confounded with that of lower and\r\nbaser men. He concluded by stating, that the owners of slaves were\r\nentitled to compensation, if, by means of the abolition, they should not\r\nbe able to find labourers for the cultivation of their lands[A].\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Mr. Vaughan declared in a future stage of the debate, that\r\nhe wished to see a prudent termination both of the Slave Trade and of\r\nslavery; and that, though he was the eldest son of his father, he never\r\nwould, on any consideration, become the owner of a slave.]\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Thornton conceived, that the two last speakers had not spoken\r\nto the point. The first had described the happy state of the slaves in\r\nthe West Indies. The latter had made similar representations; but yet\r\nhad allowed, that much improvement might be made in their condition. But\r\nthis had nothing to do with the question then before them. The manner of\r\nprocuring slaves in Africa was the great evil to be remedied. Africa was\r\nto be stripped of its inhabitants to supply a population for the West\r\nIndies. There was a Dutch proverb, which said, \"My son; get money,\r\nhonestly if you can--but get money:\" or, in other words, \"Get slaves,\r\nhonestly if you can--but get slaves.\" This was the real grievance; and\r\nthe two honourable gentlemen, by confining their observations to the\r\nWest Indies, had entirely overlooked it.\r\n\r\nThough this evil had been fully proved, he could not avoid stating to\r\nthe House some new facts, which had come to his knowledge as a director\r\nof the Sierra Leone Company, and which would still further establish it.\r\nThe consideration, that they had taken place since the discussion of the\r\nlast year on this subject, obliged him to relate them.\r\n\r\nMr. Falconbridge, agent to the Company, sitting one evening in Sierra\r\nLeone, heard a shout, and immediately afterwards the report of a gun.\r\nFearing an attack, he armed forty of the settlers, and rushed with them\r\nto the place from whence the noise came. He found a poor wretch, who had\r\nbeen crossing from a neighbouring village, in the possession of a party\r\nof kidnappers, who were tying his hands. Mr. Falconbridge, however,\r\ndared not rescue him, lest, in the defenceless state of his own town,\r\nretaliation might be made upon him.\r\n\r\nAt another time a young woman, living half a mile off, was sold, without\r\nany criminal charge, to one of the slave-ships. She was well acquainted\r\nwith the agent's wife, and had been with her only the day before. Her\r\ncries were heard; but it was impossible to relieve her.\r\n\r\nAt another time a young lad, one of the free settlers who went from\r\nEngland, was caught by a neighbouring chief, as he was straggling alone\r\nfrom home, and sold for a slave. The pretext was, that some one in the\r\ntown of Sierra Leone had committed an offence. Hence the first person\r\nbelonging to it, who could be seized, was to be punished. Happily the\r\nfree settlers saw him in his chains; and they recovered him, before he\r\nwas conveyed to the ship.\r\n\r\nTo mark still more forcibly the scenes of misery, to which the Slave\r\nTrade gave birth, he would mention a case stated to him in a letter by\r\nKing Naimbanna. It had happened to respectable person, in no less than\r\nthree instances, to have some branches of his family kidnapped, and\r\ncarried off to the West Indies. At one time three young men, Corpro,\r\nBanna, and Marbrour, were decoyed on board a Danish slave-ship, under\r\npretence of buying something, and were taken away. At another time\r\nanother relation piloted a vessel down the river. He begged to be put on\r\nshore, when he came opposite to his own town; but he was pressed to\r\npilot her to the river's mouth. The captain then pleaded the\r\nimpracticability of putting him on shore; carried him to Jamaica; and\r\nsold him for a slave. Fortunately, however, by means of a letter, which\r\nwas conveyed there, the man, by the assistance of the governor, was sent\r\nback to Sierra Leone. At another time another relation was also\r\nkidnapped. But he had not the good fortune, like the former, to return.\r\n\r\nHe would mention one other instance. A son had sold his own father, for\r\nwhom he obtained a considerable price: for, as the father was rich in\r\ndomestic slaves, it was not doubted that he would offer largely for his\r\nransom. The old man accordingly gave twenty-two of these in exchange for\r\nhimself. The rest, however, being from that time filled with\r\napprehensions of being on some ground or other sold to the slave-ships,\r\nfled to the mountains of Sierra Leone, where they now dragged on a\r\nmiserable existence. The son himself was sold, in his turn, soon after.\r\nIn short, the whole of that unhappy peninsula, as he learnt from\r\neye-witnesses, had been desolated by the trade in slaves. Towns were\r\nseen standing without inhabitants all over the coast; in several of\r\nwhich the agent of the Company had been. There was nothing but distrust\r\namong the inhabitants. Every one, if he stirred from home, felt himself\r\nobliged to be armed.\r\n\r\nSuch was the nature of the Slave Trade. It had unfortunately obtained\r\nthe name of a trade; and many had been deceived by the appellation; but\r\nit was war, and not trade. It was a mass of crimes, and not commerce. It\r\nwas that which prevented the introduction of a trade in Africa; for it\r\nwas only by clearing and cultivating the lands, that the climate could\r\nbe made healthy for settlements; but this wicked traffic, by dispersing\r\nthe inhabitants, and causing the lands to remain uncultivated, made the\r\ncoast unhealthy to Europeans. He had found, in attempting to establish a\r\ncolony there, that it was an obstacle which opposed itself to him in\r\ninnumerable ways; it created more embarrassments than all the natural\r\nimpediments of the country; and it was more hard to contend with than\r\nany difficulties of climate, soil, or natural disposition of the people.\r\n\r\nHe would say a few words relative to the numerous petitions which were\r\nthen on the table of the House. They had shown, in an extraordinary\r\nmanner, the opinion of the people. He did not wish to turn this into a\r\nconstitutional question; but he would observe, that it was of the utmost\r\nconsequence to the maintenance of the constitution of this country, that\r\nthe reputation of parliament should be maintained. But nothing could\r\nprejudice its character so much, as a vote, which should lead the people\r\nto believe that the legislative body was the more corrupt part of it,\r\nand that it was slow to adopt moral principles.\r\n\r\nIt had been often insinuated that parliament, by interfering in this\r\ntrade, departed from its proper functions; No idea could be more absurd;\r\nfor, was it not its duty to correct abuses? and what abuses were greater\r\nthan robbery and murder? He was, indeed, anxious for the abolition. He\r\ndesired it, as a commercial man, on account of the commercial character\r\nof the country. He desired it for the reputation of parliament, on which\r\nso materially depended the preservation of our happy constitution; but\r\nmost of all he prayed for it for the sake of those eternal principle's\r\nof justice, which it was the duty of nations, as well as of individuals,\r\nto support.\r\n\r\nColonel Tarleton repeated his arguments of the last year. In addition to\r\nthese he inveighed bitterly against the abolitionists, as a junto of\r\nsecretaries, sophists, enthusiasts, and fanatics. He condemned the\r\nabolition as useless, unless other nations would take it up. He brought\r\nto the recollection of the House the barbarous scenes which had taken\r\nplace it in St. Domingo, all of which, he said, had originated in the\r\ndiscussion of this question. He described the alarms, in which the\r\ninhabitants of our own islands were kept, lest similar scenes should\r\noccur from the same cause. He ridiculed the petitions on the table.\r\nItinerant clergymen, mendicant physicians, and others, had extorted\r\nsignatures from the sick, the indigent, and the traveller. School-boys\r\nwere invited to sign them, under the promise of a holiday. He had\r\nletters to produce, which would prove all these things though he was not\r\nauthorized to give up the names of those who had written them.\r\n\r\nMr. Montagu said, that, in the last session, he had simply entered his\r\nprotest against the trade; but now He could be no longer silent; and as\r\nthere were many, who had conceived regulation to be more desirable than\r\nabolition, he would himself to that subject.\r\n\r\nRegulation, as it related to the manner of procuring slaves, was utterly\r\nimpossible; for how could we know the case of each individual, whom we\r\nforced away into bondage? Could we establish tribunals all along the\r\ncoast, and in every ship, to find it out? What judges could we get for\r\nsuch an office? But, if this could not be done upon the coast, how could\r\nwe ascertain the justness of the captivity of by far the greatest\r\nnumber, who were brought from immense distances inland?\r\n\r\nHe would not dwell upon the proof of the inefficiency of regulations, as\r\nto the Middle Passage. His honourable friend, Mr. Wilberforce, had\r\nshown, that, however the mortality might have been lessened in some\r\nships by the regulations of Sir William Dolben, yet, wherever a\r\ncontagious disorder broke out, the greatest part of the cargo was swept\r\naway. But what regulations by the British parliament could prevent these\r\ncontagions, or remove them suddenly, when they appeared?\r\n\r\nNeither would regulations be effectual, as they related to the\r\nprotection of the slaves in the West Indies. It might, perhaps, be\r\nenacted, as Mr. Vaughan had suggested, that their punishments should be\r\nmoderate; and that the number of lashes should be limited. But the\r\ncolonial legislatures had already done as much, as the magic of words\r\nalone could do, upon this subject; yet the evidence upon the table\r\nclearly proved, that the only protection of slaves was in the clemency\r\nof their masters. Any barbarity might be exercised with impunity,\r\nprovided no White person were to see it, though it happened in the sight\r\nof a thousand slaves. Besides, by splitting the offence, and inflicting\r\nthe punishment at intervals, the law could be evaded, although the fact\r\nwas within the reach of the evidence of a White man. Of this evasion\r\nCaptain Cook, of the 89th regiment, had given a shocking instance; and\r\nChief Justice Ottley had candidly confessed, that \"he could devise no\r\nmethod of bringing a master, so offending, to justice, while the\r\nevidence of the slave continued inadmissible.\" But perhaps councils of\r\nprotection, and guardians of the slaves, might be appointed. This,\r\nagain, was an expedient which sounded well, but which would be nugatory\r\nand absurd. What person would risk the comfort of his life by the\r\nexercise of so invidious an interference? But supposing that one or two\r\nindividuals could be found, who would sacrifice all their time, and the\r\nfriendship of their associates, for the good of the slaves; what could\r\nthey effect? Could they be in all places at once? But even if acts of\r\nbarbarity should be related to them, how were they to come at the proof\r\nof them?\r\n\r\nIt appeared, then, that no regulations could be effectual until the\r\nslaves were admitted to give their evidence; but to admit them to this\r\nprivilege in their present state, would be to endanger the safety and\r\nproperty of their masters. Mr. Vaughan had, however, recommended this\r\nmeasure with limitations, but it would produce nothing but discontent;\r\nfor how were the slaves to be persuaded that it was fit they should be\r\nadmitted to speak the truth, and then be disbelieved and disregarded?\r\nWhat a fermentation would such conduct naturally excite in men dismissed\r\nwith injuries unredressed, though abundantly proved, in their\r\napprehension, by their testimony? In fact, no regulations would do.\r\nThere was no cure for these evils, but in the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade. He called upon the planters to concur with his honourable friend,\r\nMr. Wilberforce, in this great measure. He wished them to consider the\r\nprogress which the opinion of the injustice of this trade was making in\r\nthe nation at large, as manifested by the petitions; which had almost\r\nobstructed the proceedings of the House by their perpetual introduction.\r\nIt was impossible for them to stifle this great question. As for\r\nhimself, he would renew his profession of last year, that he would never\r\ncease, but with life, to promote so glorious an end.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitbread said, that even if he could conceive, that the trade was,\r\nas some had asserted it to be, founded on principles of humanity; that\r\nthe Africans were rescued from death in their own country; that, upon\r\nbeing carried to the West Indies, they were put under kind masters; that\r\ntheir labour there was easy; that at evening they returned cheerful to\r\ntheir homes; that in sickness they were attended with care; and that\r\ntheir old age was rendered comfortable; even then he would vote for the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade, inasmuch as he was convinced that that\r\nwhich was fundamentally wrong, no practice could justify.\r\n\r\nNo eloquence could persuade him, that the Africans were torn from their\r\ncountry and their dearest connexions, merely that they might lead a\r\nhappier life; or that they could be placed under the uncontrolled\r\ndominion of others without suffering. Arbitrary power would spoil the\r\nhearts of the best; hence would arise tyranny on the one side, and a\r\nsense of injury on the other. Hence the passions would be let loose, and\r\na state of perpetual enmity would follow.\r\n\r\nHe needed only to go to the accounts of those who defended the system of\r\nslavery, to show that it was cruel. He was forcibly struck last year by\r\nan expression of an honourable member, an advocate for the trade, who,\r\nwhen he came to speak of the slaves, on selling off the stock of a\r\nplantation, said that they fetched less than the common price, because\r\nthey were damaged. Damaged! What! Were they goods and chattels? What an\r\nidea was this to hold out of our fellow-creatures! We might imagine how\r\nslaves were treated, if they could be spoken of in such a manner.\r\nPerhaps these unhappy people had lingered out the best part of their\r\nlives in the service of their master. Able then to do but little, they\r\nwere sold for little! and the remaining substance of their sinews was to\r\nbe pressed out by another, yet more hardened than the former, and who\r\nhad made a calculation of their vitals accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs another proof, he would mention a passage in a pamphlet, in which the\r\nauthor, describing the happy situation of the slaves, observed, that a\r\ngood negro never wanted a character; a bad one could always be detected\r\nby his weals and scars. What was this but to say, that there were\r\ninstruments in use which left indelible marks, behind them; and who\r\nwould say that these were used justly?\r\n\r\nAn honourable gentleman, Mr. Vaughan, had said, that setting aside\r\nslavery, the slaves were better off than the poor in this country. But\r\nwhat was it that we wished to abolish! Was it not the Slave Trade, which\r\nwould destroy in time the cruel distinction he had mentioned? The same\r\nhonourable gentleman had also expressed his admiration of their\r\nresignation; but might it not be that resignation which was the\r\nconsequence of despair?\r\n\r\nColonel Tarleton had insinuated that the petitions on the table had been\r\nobtained in an objectionable manner. He had the honour to present one\r\nfrom his constituents, which he would venture to say had originated with\r\nthemselves, and that there did not exist more respectable names in the\r\nkingdom than those of the persons who had signed it. He had also\r\nasserted, that there was a strong similitude in their tenour and\r\nsubstance, as if they had been manufactured by the same persons. This\r\nwas by no means to be wondered at. There was surely but one plain tale\r\nto tell, and it was not surprising that it had been clothed in nearly\r\nthe same expressions. There was but one boon to ask, and that was--the\r\nabolition of this wicked trade.\r\n\r\nIt had been said by another, (Mr. Baillie,) that the horrible\r\ninsurrections in St. Domingo arose from the discussion of the question\r\nof the Slave Trade. He denied the assertion; and maintained that they\r\nwere the effect of the trade itself. There was a point of endurance,\r\nbeyond which human nature could not go, at which the mind of man rose by\r\nits native elasticity with a spring and violence proportioned to the\r\ndegree to which it had been depressed. The calamities in St. Domingo\r\nproceeded from the Slave Trade alone; and, if it were continued, similar\r\nevils were to be apprehended in our own islands. The cruelties which the\r\nslaves had perpetrated in that unfortunate colony they had learnt from\r\ntheir masters. Had not an African eyes? Had he not ears? Had he not\r\norgans, senses, and passions? If you pricked him, would he not feel the\r\npuncture, and bleed? If you poisoned him, would he not die? and, if you\r\nwronged him, would he not revenge? But he had said sufficient, for he\r\nfeared he could not better the instruction.\r\n\r\nMr. Milbank would only just observe, that the policy of the measure of\r\nthe abolition was as great as its justice was undeniable. Where slavery\r\nexisted, everything was out of its natural place. All improvement was at\r\nan end; there must also, from the nature of the human heart, be\r\noppression. He warned the planters against the danger of fresh\r\nimportations, and invited their concurrence in the measure.\r\n\r\nMr. Dundas (afterwards Viscount Melville) declared that he had always\r\nbeen a warm friend to the abolition of the Slave Trade, though he\r\ndiffered from Mr. Wilberforce as to the mode of effecting it.\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists, and those on the opposite side of the question, had,\r\nboth of them, gone into extremes. The former were for the immediate and\r\nabrupt annihilation of the trade; the latter considered it as\r\nessentially necessary to the existence of the West Indian islands, and\r\ntherefore laid it down that it was to be continued for ever. Such was\r\nthe vast distance between the parties. He would now address himself to\r\neach.\r\n\r\nHe would say first, that he agreed with his honourable friend, Mr.\r\nWilberforce, in very material points. He believed the trade was not\r\nfounded in policy; that the continuation of it was not essential to the\r\npreservation of our trade with the West Indian islands; and that the\r\nslaves were not only to be maintained, but increased there, by natural\r\npopulation. He agreed, too, as to the propriety of the abolition. But\r\nwhen his honourable friend talked of direct and abrupt abolition, he\r\nwould submit it to him, whether he did not run counter to the prejudices\r\nof those who were most deeply interested in the question; and whether,\r\nif he could obtain his object without wounding these, it would not be\r\nbetter to do it? Did he not also forget the sacred attention which\r\nparliament had ever shown to the private interests and patrimonial\r\nrights of individuals?\r\n\r\nWhatever idea men might then have of the African trade, certain it was\r\nthat they, who had connected themselves with it, had done it under the\r\nsanction of parliament. It might also be well worth while to consider,\r\n(though the conduct of other nations ought not to deter us from doing\r\nour duty,) whether British subjects in the West Indies might not be\r\nsupplied with slaves under neutral flags. Now he believed it was\r\npossible to avoid these objections, and at the same time to act in\r\nharmony with the prejudices which had been mentioned. This might be done\r\nby regulations, by which we should effect the end much more speedily\r\nthan by the way proposed. By regulations, he meant such as would\r\nincrease the breed of the slaves in the West Indies; such as would\r\nensure a moral education to their children; and such as would even in\r\ntime extinguish hereditary slavery. The extinction, however, of this was\r\nnot to be effected by allowing the son of an African slave to obtain his\r\nfreedom on the death of his parent. Such a son should be considered as\r\nborn free; he should then be educated at the expense of the person\r\nimporting his parents; and, when arrived at such a degree of strength as\r\nmight qualify him to labour, he should work for a term of years for the\r\npayment of the expense of his education and maintenance. It was\r\nimpossible to emancipate the existing slaves at once; nor would such an\r\nemancipation be of any immediate benefit to themselves; but this\r\nobservation would not apply to their descendants, if trained and\r\neducated in the manner he had proposed.\r\n\r\nHe would now address himself to those who adopted the opposite extreme;\r\nand he thought he should not assume too much when he said, that if both\r\nslavery and the Slave Trade could be abolished with safety to their\r\nproperty, it deeply concerned their interests to do it. Such a measure,\r\nalso, would only be consistent with the principles of the British\r\nconstitution. It was surely strange that we, who were ourselves free,\r\nshould carry on a Slave Trade with Africa, and that we should never\r\nthink of introducing cultivation into the West Indies by free labourers.\r\n\r\nThat such a measure would tend to their interest he had no doubt. Did\r\nnot all of them agree with Mr. Long, that the great danger in the West\r\nIndies arose from the importation of the African slaves there? Mr. Long\r\nhad asserted, that all the insurrections there arose from these. If this\r\nstatement was true, how directly it bore upon the present question! But\r\nwe were told, also, by the same author, that the Slave Trade gave rise\r\nto robbery, murder, and all kinds of depredations on the coast of\r\nAfrica. Had this been answered? No: except indeed it had been said that\r\nthe slaves were such as had been condemned for crimes. Well, then, the\r\nimported Africans consisted of all the convicts, rogues, thieves, and\r\nvagabonds in Africa. But would the West Indians choose to depend on\r\nfresh supplies of these for the cultivation of their lands, and the\r\nsecurity of their islands, when it was also found that every\r\ninsurrection had arisen from them? It was plain the safety of the\r\nislands was concerned in this question. There would be danger so long as\r\nthe trade lasted. The planters were, by these importations, creating the\r\nengines of their own destruction. Surely they would act more to their\r\nown interest if they would concur in extinguishing the trade, than by\r\nstanding up for its continuance.\r\n\r\nHe would now ask them, what right they had to suppose that Africa would\r\nfor ever remain in a state of barbarism. If once an enlightened prince\r\nwere to rise up there, his first act would be to annihilate the Slave\r\nTrade. If the light of heaven were ever to descend upon that continent,\r\nit would directly occasion its downfall. It was their interest then to\r\ncontrive a mode of supplying labour, without trusting to precarious\r\nimportations from that quarter. They might rest assured that the trade\r\ncould not continue. He did not allude to the voice of the people in the\r\npetitions then lying on the table of the House; but he knew certainly,\r\nthat an idea not only of the injustice, but of the impolicy, of this\r\ntrade had been long entertained by men of the most enlightened\r\nunderstandings in this country. Was it then a prudent thing for them to\r\nrest on this commerce for the further improvement of their property?\r\n\r\nThere was a species of slavery, prevailing only a few years ago, in the\r\ncollieries in certain boroughs in Scotland. Emancipation there was\r\nthought a duty by parliament: but what an opposition there was to the\r\nmeasure! Nothing but ruin would be the consequence of it! After several\r\nyears struggle the bill was Carried. Within a year after, the ruin so\r\nmuch talked of vanished in smoke, and there was an end of the business.\r\nIt had also been contended that Sir William Dolben's bill would be the\r\nruin of Liverpool: and yet one of its representatives had allowed, that\r\nthis bill had been of benefit to the owners of the slave-vessels there.\r\nWas he then asking too much of the West Indians, to request a candid\r\nconsideration of the real ground of their alarms? He would conclude by\r\nstating, that he meant to propose a middle way of proceeding. If there\r\nwas a number of members in the House, who thought with him, that this\r\ntrade ought to be ultimately abolished, but yet by moderate measures,\r\nwhich should neither invade the property nor the prejudices of\r\nindividuals, he wished them to unite, and they might then reduce the\r\nquestion to its proper limits.\r\n\r\nMr. Addington, the speaker, (now Viscount Sidmouth,) professed himself\r\nto be one of those moderate persons called upon by Mr. Dundas. He wished\r\nto see some middle measure suggested. The fear of doing injury to the\r\nproperty of others, had hitherto prevented him from giving an opinion\r\nagainst a system, the continuance of which he could not countenance.\r\n\r\nHe utterly abhorred the Slave Trade. A noble and learned lord, who had\r\nnow retired from the bench, said on a certain occasion, that he pitied\r\nthe loyalty of that man, who imagined that any epithet could aggravate\r\nthe crime of treason. So he himself knew of no language which could\r\naggravate the crime of the Slave Trade. It was sufficient for every\r\npurpose of crimination, to assert, that man thereby was bought; and\r\nsold, or that he was made subject to the despotism of man. But though he\r\nthus acknowledged the justice due to a whole continent on the one side,\r\nhe confessed there were opposing claims of justice on the other. The\r\ncase of the West Indians deserved a tender consideration also.\r\n\r\nHe doubted, if we were to relinquish the Slave Trade alone, whether it\r\nmight not be carried on still more barbarously than at present; and\r\nwhether, if we were to stop it altogether, the islands could keep up\r\ntheir present stocks. It had been asserted that they could. But he,\r\nthought that the stopping of the imputations could not be depended upon\r\nfor this purpose, so much as a plan for providing them with more\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\nWith the mode suggested by his right honourable friend, Mr. Dundas, he\r\nwas pleased, though he, did not wholly agree to it. He could not grant\r\nliberty to the children born in the islands. He thought, also, that the\r\ntrade ought to be permitted for ten or twelve years longer, under such\r\narrangements as should introduce a kind of management among the slaves\r\nthere, favourable to their interests, and of course to their future\r\nhappiness. One species of regulation which he should propose, would be\r\ngreater encouragement to the importation of females than of males, by\r\nmeans of a bounty on the former till their numbers should be found\r\nequal. Rewards also might be given to those slaves who should raise a\r\ncertain number of children; and to those who should devise means of\r\nlightening negro-labour. If the plan of his honourable friend should\r\ncomprehend these regulations, he would heartily concur in it. He wished\r\nto see the Slave Trade abolished. Indeed it did not deserve the name of\r\na trade. It was not a trade, and ought not to be allowed. He was\r\nsatisfied, that in a few years it would cease to be the reproach of this\r\nnation and the torment of Africa. But under regulations like these, it\r\nwould cease without any material injury to the interests of others.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox said, that after what had fallen from the two last speakers, he\r\ncould remain no longer silent. Something so mischievous had come out,\r\nand something so like a foundation had been laid for preserving, not\r\nonly for years to come, but for ever, this detestable traffic, that he\r\nshould feel himself wanting in his duty, if he were not to deprecate all\r\nsuch deceptions and delusions upon the country.\r\n\r\nThe honourable gentlemen had called themselves moderate men: but upon\r\nthis subject he neither felt, nor desired to feel, anything like a\r\nsentiment of moderation. Their speeches had reminded him of a passage in\r\nMIDDLETON'S _Life of Cicero_. The translation of it was defective,\r\nthough it would equally suit his purpose. He says, \"To enter into a\r\nman's house, and kill him, his wife, and family, in the night, is\r\ncertainly a most heinous crime, and deserving of death; but to break\r\nopen his house, to murder him, his wife, and all his children in the\r\nnight, may be still very right, provided it be done with moderation.\"\r\nNow, was there anything more absurd in this passage, than to say, that\r\nthe Slave Trade might be carried on with moderation; for, if you could\r\nnot rob or murder a single man with moderation, with what moderation\r\ncould you pillage and wound a whole nation? In fact, the question of the\r\nabolition was simply a question of justice. It was only, whether we\r\nshould authorize by law, respecting Africa, the commission of crimes,\r\nfor which, in this country, we should forfeit our lives: notwithstanding\r\nwhich, it was to be treated, in the opinion of these honourable\r\ngentlemen, with moderation.\r\n\r\nMr. Addington had proposed to cure the disproportion of the sexes in the\r\nislands, by a bounty on the importation of females; or, in other words,\r\nby offering a premium to any crew of ruffians, who would tear them from\r\ntheir native country. He would let loose a banditti against the most\r\nweak and defenceless of the sex. He would occasion these to kill\r\nfathers, husbands, and brothers, to get possession of their relatives,\r\nthe females, who, after this carnage, were to be reserved for--slavery.\r\nHe should like to see the man, who would pen such a moderate clause for\r\na British parliament.\r\n\r\nMr. Dundas had proposed to abolish the Slave Trade, by bettering the\r\nstate of the slaves in the islands, and particularly that of their\r\noffspring. His plan, with respect to the latter, was not a little\r\ncurious. They were to become free, when born; and then they were to be\r\neducated, at the expense of those to whom their fathers belonged. But it\r\nwas clear, that they could not be educated for nothing. In order,\r\ntherefore, to repay this expense, they were to be slaves for ten or\r\nfifteen years. In short, they were to have an education, which was to\r\nqualify them to become freemen; and after they had been so educated,\r\nthey were to become slaves. But as this free education might possibly\r\nunfit them for submitting to slavery; so, after they had been made to\r\nbow under the yoke for ten or fifteen years, they might then, perhaps,\r\nbe equally unfit to become free; and therefore, might be retained as\r\nslaves for a few years longer, if not for their whole lives. He never\r\nheard of a scheme so moderate, and yet so absurd and visionary.\r\n\r\nThe same honourable gentleman had observed, that the conduct of other\r\nnations should not hinder us from doing, our duty; but yet neutrals\r\nwould furnish, our islands with slaves. What was the inference from this\r\nmoderate assertion, but that we might as well supply them ourselves? He\r\nhoped, if we were yet to be supplied, it would never be by Englishmen.\r\nWe ought no longer to be concerned in such a crime.\r\n\r\nAn adversary, Mr. Baillie, had said, that it would not be fair to take\r\nthe character of this country from the records of the Old Bailey. He did\r\nnot at all wonder, when the subject of the Slave Trade was mentioned,\r\nthat the Old Bailey naturally occurred to his recollection. The facts,\r\nwhich had been described in the evidence, were associated in all our\r\nminds with the ideas of criminal justice. But Mr. Baillie had forgot the\r\nessential difference between the two cases. When we learnt from these\r\nrecords, that crimes were committed in this country, we learnt also,\r\nthat they were punished with transportation and death. But the crimes\r\ncommitted in the Slave Trade were passed over with impunity. Nay, the\r\nperpetrators were even sent out again to commit others.\r\n\r\nAs to the mode of obtaining slaves, it had been suggested as the least\r\ndisreputable, that they became so in consequence of condemnation as\r\ncriminals. But he would judge of the probability of this mode by the\r\nreasonableness of it. No less than eighty thousand Africans were\r\nexported annually by the different nations of Europe from their own\r\ncountry. Was it possible to believe that this number could have been\r\nlegally convicted of crimes, for which they had justly forfeited their\r\nliberty? The supposition was ridiculous. The truth was, that every\r\nenormity was practised to obtain the persons of these unhappy people; He\r\nreferred those present to the case in the evidence of the African\r\ntrader, who had kidnapped and sold a girl, and who was afterwards\r\nkidnapped and sold himself. He desired them to reason upon the\r\nconversation which had taken place between the trader and the captain of\r\nthe ship on this occasion. He desired them also to reason upon the\r\ninstance mentioned this evening, which had happened in the river\r\nCameroons, and they would infer all the rapine, all the desolation, and\r\nall the bloodshed, which had been placed to the account of this\r\nexecrable trade.\r\n\r\nAn attempt had been made to impress the House with the horrible scenes\r\nwhich had taken place in St. Domingo, as an argument against the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade; but could any more weighty argument be\r\nproduced in its favour? What were the causes of the insurrections there?\r\nThey were two. The first was the indecision of the National Assembly,\r\nwho wished to compromise between that which was right and that which was\r\nwrong on this subject. And the second was the oppression of the people\r\nof colour, and of the slaves. In the first of the causes we saw\r\nsomething like the moderation of Mr. Dundas and Mr. Addington. One day\r\nthis Assembly talked of liberty, and favoured the Blacks. Another day\r\nthey suspended their measures and favoured the Whites. They wished to\r\nsteer a middle course; but decision had been mercy. Decision even\r\nagainst the planters would have been a thousand times better than\r\nindecision and half measures. In the mean time, the people of colour\r\ntook the great work of justice into their own hands. Unable, however, to\r\ncomplete this of themselves, they called in the aid of the slaves. Here\r\nbegan the second cause; for the slaves, feeling their own power, began\r\nto retaliate on the Whites. And here it may be observed, that, in all\r\nrevolutions, the clemency or cruelty of the victors will always be in\r\nproportion to their former privileges, of their oppression. That the\r\nslaves then should have been guilty of great excesses, was not to be\r\nwondered at; for where did they learn their cruelty? They learnt it from\r\nthose who had tyrannized over them. The oppression, which they\r\nthemselves had suffered, was fresh in their memories, and this had\r\ndriven them to exercise their vengeance so furiously. If we wished to\r\nprevent similar scenes in our own islands, we must reject all moderate\r\nmeasures, and at once abolish the Slave Trade. By doing this, we should\r\nprocure a better treatment for the slaves there; and when this happy\r\nchange of system should have taken place, we might depend on them for\r\nthe defence of the islands as much as on the whites themselves.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, he would give his opinion of this traffic in a few\r\nwords. He believed it to be impolitic--he knew it to be inhuman--he was\r\ncertain it was unjust--he thought it so inhuman and unjust, that, if the\r\ncolonies could not be cultivated without it, they ought not to be\r\ncultivated at all. It would be much better for us to be without them,\r\nthan, not abolish the Slave Trade. He hoped therefore that members would\r\nthis night act the part which would do them honour. He declared, that,\r\nwhether he should vote in a large minority or a small one, he would\r\nnever give up the cause. Whether in Parliament or out of it, in whatever\r\nsituation he might ever be, as long as he had a voice to speak, this\r\nquestion should never be at rest. Believing the trade to be of the\r\nnature of crimes and pollutions, which stained the honour of the\r\ncountry, he would never relax his efforts. It was his duty to prevent\r\nman from preying upon man; and if he and his friends should die before\r\nthey had attained their glorious object, he hoped there would never be\r\nwanting men alive to their duty, who would continue to labour till the\r\nevil should be wholly done away. If the situation of the Africans was as\r\nhappy as servitude could make them, he could not consent to the enormous\r\ncrime of selling man to man; nor permit a practice to continue, which\r\nput an entire bar to the civilization of one quarter of the globe. He\r\nwas sure that the nation would not much longer allow the continuance of\r\nenormities which shocked human nature. The West Indians had no right to\r\ndemand that crimes should be permitted by this country for their\r\nadvantage; and, if they were wise, they would lend their cordial\r\nassistance to such measures, as would bring about, in the shortest\r\npossible time, the abolition of this execrable trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Dundas rose again, but it was only to move an amendment, namely,\r\nthat the word \"gradually\" should be inserted before the words \"to be\r\nabolished\" in Mr. Wilberforce's motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenkinson (afterwards Earl of Liverpool) said, that the opinions of\r\nthose who were averse to the abolition had been unfairly stated. They\r\nhad been described as founded on policy, in opposition to humanity. If\r\nit could be made out that humanity would be aided by the abolition, he\r\nwould be the last person to oppose it. The question was not, he\r\napprehended, whether the trade was founded in injustice and oppression:\r\nhe admitted it was. Nor was it, whether it was in itself abstractedly an\r\nevil: he admitted this also; but whether, under all the circumstances of\r\nthe case, any considerable advantage would arise to a number of our\r\nfellow-creatures from the abolition of the trade in the manner in which\r\nit had been proposed.\r\n\r\nHe was ready to admit, that the Africans at home were made miserable by\r\nthe Slave Trade, and that, if it were universally abolished, great\r\nbenefit would arise to them. No one, however, would assert, that these\r\nmiseries arose from the trade as carried on by Great Britain only. Other\r\ncountries occasioned as much of the evil as we did; and if the abolition\r\nof it by us should prove only the transferring of it to those countries,\r\nvery little benefit would result from the measure.\r\n\r\nWhat then was the probability of our example being followed by foreign\r\npowers? Five years had now elapsed since the question was first started,\r\nand what had any of them done? The Portuguese continued the trade. The\r\nSpaniards still gave a bounty to encourage it. He believed there were\r\nagents from Holland in this country, who were then negotiating with\r\npersons concerned in it in order to secure its continuance. The\r\nabolition also had been proposed in the National Assembly of France, and\r\nhad been rejected there. From these circumstances he had a right to\r\ninfer, that if we gave up the trade, we should only transfer it to those\r\ncountries: but this transfer would be entirely against the Africans. The\r\nmortality on board English ships, previously to the regulating bill, was\r\nfour and an-eighth per cent. Since that time it had been reduced to\r\nlittle more than three per cent[A]. In French ships it was near ten, and\r\nin Dutch ships from five to seven, per cent. In Portuguese it was less\r\nthan either in French or Dutch, but more than in English ships since the\r\nregulating bill. Thus the deaths of the Africans would be more than\r\ndoubled, if we were to abolish the trade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Mr. Wilberforce stated it on the same evening to be between\r\nten and eleven per cent. for the last year. The number then exported\r\nfrom Africa to our islands was rather more than 22,000, of whom more\r\nthan 2,300 died.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it might be replied, that the importations being stopped in our\r\nown islands, fewer Africans would experience this misery, because fewer\r\nwould be taken from their own country on this account. But he had a\r\nright to infer, that as the planters purchased slaves at present, they\r\nwould still think it their interest to have them. The question then was,\r\nwhether they could get them by smuggling. Now it appeared by the\r\nevidence, that many hundred slaves had been stolen from time to time\r\nfrom Jamaica, and carried into Cuba. But if persons could smuggle slaves\r\nout of our colonies, they could smuggle slaves into them; but\r\nparticularly when the planters might think it to their interest to\r\nassist them.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the slaves there, instances had been related of their\r\noppression, which shocked the feelings of all who heard them: but was it\r\nfair to infer from these their general ill usage? Suppose a person were\r\nto make a collection of the different abuses, which had happened for a\r\nseries of years under our own happy constitution, and use these as an\r\nargument of its worthlessness; should we not say to him, that in the\r\nmost perfect system which the human intellect could form some defects\r\nwould exist; and that it was unfair to draw inferences from such partial\r\nfacts? In the same manner he would argue relative to the alleged\r\ntreatment of the slaves. Evidence had been produced upon this point on\r\nboth sides. He should not be afraid to oppose the authorities of Lord\r\nRodney, and others, against any, however respectable, in favour of the\r\nabolition. But this was not necessary. There was another species of\r\nfacts, which would answer the same end; Previously to the year 1730 the\r\ndecrease of the slaves in our islands was very considerable. From 1730\r\nto 1755 the deaths were reduced to only two and a-half per cent, above\r\nthe births; from 1755 to 1768 to only one and three-fourths; and from\r\n1768 to 1788 to only one per cent. This then, on the first view of the\r\nsubject, would show, that whatever might have been the situation of\r\nslaves formerly, it had been gradually improved. But if, in addition to\r\nthis, we considered the peculiar disadvanges under which they laboured;\r\nthe small proportion of females to males; and the hurricanes, and\r\nfamines, which had swept away thousands, we should find it physically\r\nimpossible, that they could have increased as related, if they had been\r\ntreated as cruelly as the friends of the abolition had described.\r\n\r\nThis species of facts would enable him also to draw still more important\r\nconclusions; namely, that as the slaves in the West Indies had gradually\r\nincreased, they would continue to increase; that very few years would\r\npass, not only before the births were equal to the deaths, but before\r\nthey were more numerous than the deaths; and that if this was likely to\r\nhappen in the present state of things, how much more would it happen, if\r\nby certain regulations the increase of the slaves should be encouraged?\r\n\r\nThe only question then was, whether it was more advantageous to breed or\r\nto import. He thought he should prove the former; and if so, then this\r\nincrease was inevitable, and the importations would necessarily cease.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the gradual increase of the slaves of late years\r\nclearly proved, that such increase had been encouraged. But their price\r\nhad been doubled in the last twenty years. The planter, therefore, must\r\nfeel it his interest to desist from purchasing, if possible. But again,\r\nthe greatest mortality was among the newly imported slaves. The diseases\r\nthey contracted on the passage, and their deaths in the seasoning, all\r\nmade for the same doctrine. Add to this, that slaves bred in the islands\r\nwere more expert at colonial labour, more reconciled to their situation,\r\nand better disposed towards their masters than those who were brought\r\nfrom Africa.\r\n\r\nBut it had been said, that the births and deaths in the islands were now\r\nequal; and that therefore no further supply was wanted. He denied the\r\npropriety of this inference. The slaves were subject to peculiar\r\ndiseases. They were exposed also to hurricanes and consequent famines.\r\nThat the day, however, would come, when the stock there would be\r\nsufficient, no person who attended to the former part of his argument\r\ncould doubt. That they had gradually increased, were gradually\r\nincreasing, and would, by certain regulations, increase more and more,\r\nmust be equally obvious. But these were all considerations for\r\ncontinuing the traffic a little longer.\r\n\r\nHe then desired the House to reflect upon the state of St. Domingo. Had\r\nnot its calamities been imputed by its own deputies to the advocates for\r\nthe abolition? Were ever any scenes of horror equal to those which had\r\npassed there? And should we, when principles of the same sort were\r\nlurking in our own islands, expose our fellow-subjects to the same\r\nmiseries, who, if guilty of promoting this trade, had, at least, been\r\nencouraged in it by ourselves?\r\n\r\nThat the Slave Trade was an evil, he admitted. That the state of slavery\r\nitself was likewise an evil, he admitted; and if the question was, not\r\nwhether we should abolish, but whether we should establish these, he\r\nwould be the first to oppose himself to their existence; but there were\r\nmany evils, which we should have thought it our duty to prevent, yet\r\nwhich, when they had once arisen, it was more dangerous to oppose than\r\nto submit to,--The duty of a statesman was, not to consider abstractedly\r\nwhat was right or wrong, but to weigh the consequences which were likely\r\nto result from the abolition of an evil, against those which were likely\r\nto result from its continuance. Agreeing then most perfectly with the\r\nabolitionists in their end, he differed from them only in the means of\r\naccomplishing it. He was desirous of doing that gradually, which he\r\nconceived they were doing rashly. He had therefore drawn up two\r\npropositions. The first was, That an address be presented to His\r\nMajesty, that he would recommend to the colonial assemblies to grant\r\npremiums to such planters, and overseers, as should distinguish\r\nthemselves by promoting the annual increase of the slaves by birth; and\r\nlikewise freedom to every female slave, who had reared five children to\r\nthe age of seven years. The second was, That a bounty of five pounds per\r\nhead be given to the master of every slave-ship, who should import in\r\nany cargo a greater number of females than males, not exceeding the age\r\nof twenty-five years. To bring, forward these propositions, he would now\r\nmove that the chairman leave the chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Este wished the debate to be adjourned. He allowed there were many\r\nenormities in the trade, which called for regulation. There were two\r\npropositions before the House: the one for the immediate, and the other\r\nfor the gradual, abolition of the trade. He thought that members should\r\nbe allowed time to compare their respective merits. At present his own\r\nopinion was, that gradual abolition would answer the end proposed in the\r\nleast exceptionable manner.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt rejoiced that the debate had taken a turn, which contracted the\r\nquestion into such narrow limits. The matter then in dispute was merely\r\nas to the time at which the abolition should take, place. He therefore\r\ncongratulated the House, the country, and the world, that this great\r\npoint had been gained; that we might now consider this trade as having\r\nreceived its condemnation; that this curse of mankind was seen in its\r\ntrue light; and that the greatest stigma on our national character,\r\nwhich ever yet existed, was about to be removed! Mankind, he trusted,\r\nwere now likely to be delivered from the greatest practical evil that\r\never afflicted the human race--from the most severe and extensive\r\ncalamity recorded in the history of the world.\r\n\r\nHis honourable friend (Mr. Jenkinson) had insinuated, that any act for\r\nthe abolition would be evaded. But if we were to enforce this act with\r\nall the powers of the country, how could it fail to be effectual? But\r\nhis honourable friend had himself satisfied him, upon this point. He had\r\nacknowledged, that the trade would drop of itself, on account of the\r\nincreasing dearness of the commodity imported. He would ask then, if we\r\nwere to leave to the importer no means of importation but by smuggling;\r\nand if, besides all the present disadvantages, we were to load him with\r\nall the charges and hazards of the smuggler, would there be any danger\r\nof any considerable supply of fresh slaves being poured into the islands\r\nthrough this channel? The question under these circumstances, he\r\npronounced, would not bear a dispute.\r\n\r\nHis honourable friend had also maintained, that it would be inexpedient\r\nto stop the importations immediately, because the deaths and births in\r\nthe islands were as yet not equal. But he (Mr. Pitt) had proved last\r\nyear, from the most authentic documents, that an increase of the births\r\nabove the deaths had already taken place. This then was the time for\r\nbeginning the abolition. But he would now observe, that five years had\r\nelapsed since these documents were framed; and therefore the presumption\r\nwas, that the black population was increasing at an extraordinary rate.\r\nHe had not, to be sure, in his consideration of the subject, entered\r\ninto the dreadful mortality arising from the clearing of new lands.\r\nImportations for this purpose were to be considered, not as carrying on\r\nthe trade, but as setting on foot a Slave Trade, a measure which he\r\nbelieved no one present would then support. He therefore asked his\r\nhonourable friend, whether the period he had looked to was now arrived?\r\nwhether the West Indies, at this hour, were, not in a state in which\r\nthey could maintain their population?\r\n\r\nIt had been argued, that one or other of these two, assertions was\r\nfalse; that either the population of the slaves must be decreasing,\r\n(which the abolitionists denied,) or, if it was increasing, the slaves\r\nmust have been well treated. That their population was rather increasing\r\nthan otherwise, and also that their general treatment was by no means so\r\ngood as it ought to have been, were both points which had been proved by\r\ndifferent witnesses. Neither were they incompatible with each other. But\r\nhe would see whether the explanation of this seeming contradiction would\r\nnot refute the argument of expediency, as advanced by his honourable\r\nfriend. Did the slaves decrease in numbers?--Yes. Then ill usage must\r\nhave been the cause of it; but if so, the abolition was immediately\r\nnecessary to, restrain it. Did they, on the other hand, increase?--Yes.\r\nBut if so, no further importations, were wanted. Was their population\r\n(to take a middle course) nearly stationary, and their treatment neither\r\nso good nor so bad as it might be?--Yes. But if so, this was the proper\r\nperiod for stopping further supplies; for both the population and the\r\ntreatment would be improved by such a measure.\r\n\r\nBut he would show again the futility of the, argument of his honourable\r\nfriend. He himself had admitted that it was in the power of the\r\ncolonists to correct the various abuses, by which the Negro population\r\nwas restrained. But, they could not do this without improving the\r\ncondition of their slaves; without making them approximate towards the\r\nrank of citizens; without giving them some little interest in their\r\nlabour, which would occasion them to work with the energy of men. But\r\nnow the Assembly of Grenada had themselves stated, \"that though the\r\nNegroes were allowed the afternoons of only one day in every week they\r\nwould do as much work in that afternoon, when employed for their own\r\nbenefit as in the whole day, when employed in their masters' service.\"\r\nNow, after, this, confession, the House might burn all his calculations\r\nrelative to the Negro population; for, if it had not yet quite reached\r\nthe desirable state which he had pointed out, this confession had\r\nproved, that further supplies were not wanted. A Negro, if he worked for\r\nhimself, could do double work. By an improvement then in the mode of\r\nlabour, the work in the islands could be doubled. But if so, what would\r\nbecome of the argument of his honourable friend? for then only half the\r\nnumber of the present labourers were necessary.\r\n\r\nHe would now try this argument of expediency by other considerations.\r\nThe best informed writers on the subject had told us, that the purchase\r\nof new Negroes was injurious to the, planters. But if this statement was\r\njust, would not the abolition be beneficial to them? That it would, was\r\nthe opinion of Mr. Long, their own historian. \"If the Slave Trade,\" says\r\nhe, \"was prohibited for four or five years, it would enable them to\r\nretrieve their affairs by preventing them from running into debt, either\r\nby renting or purchasing Negroes.\" To this acknowledgment he would add a\r\nfact from the evidence, which was, that a North American province, by\r\nsuch a prohibition alone for a few years from being deeply plunged in\r\ndebt, had become independent, rich, and flourishing.\r\n\r\nThe next consideration was the danger, to which the islands, were\r\nexposed from the newly imported slaves. Mr. Long, with a view of\r\npreventing insurrections, had advised, that a duty equal to a\r\nprohibition, might be laid on the importation of Coromantine slaves.\r\nAfter noticing one insurrection, which happened through their means, he\r\nspeaks of another in the following year, in which thirty-three\r\nCoromantines, \"most of whom had been newly imported, murdered and\r\nwounded no less than nineteen Whites in the, space of an hour.\" To the\r\nauthority of Mr Long he would add the recorded opinion of a committee of\r\nthe House of Assembly of Jamaica, which was appointed to inquire into\r\nthe best means of preventing future insurrections. The committee\r\nreported, that \"the rebellion had originated, like most others, with the\r\nCoromantines,\" and they proposed that a bill should he brought in for\r\nlaying a higher duty on the importation of these particular Negroes,\r\nwhich should operate as a prohibition. But the danger was not confined\r\nto the introduction of Coromantines. Mr. Long accounts for the frequent\r\ninsurrections in Jamaica from the greatness of its general importations.\r\n\"In two years and a-half,\" says he, \"twenty-seven thousand Negroes have\r\nbeen imported.--No wonder that we have rebellions!\" Surely then, when\r\nhis honourable friend spoke of the calamities of St. Domingo, and of\r\nsimilar dangers impending over our own islands, it ill became him to be\r\nthe person to cry out for further importations! It ill became him to\r\ncharge upon the abolitionists the crime of stirring up insurrections,\r\nwho only recommended what the legislature of Jamaica itself had laid\r\ndown in a time of danger with an avowed view to prevent them. It was,\r\nindeed, a great satisfaction to himself, that among the many arguments\r\nfor prohibiting the Slave Trade, the security of our West Indian\r\npossessions against internal commotions, as well as foreign enemies, was\r\namong the most prominent and forcible. And here he would ask his\r\nhonourable friend, whether in this part of the argument he did not see\r\nreason for immediate abolition. Why should we any longer persist in\r\nintroducing those latent principles of conflagration, which, if they\r\nshould once burst forth, might annihilate the industry of a hundred\r\nyears? which might throw the planters back a whole century in their\r\nprofits, in their cultivation, and in their progress towards the\r\nemancipation of their slaves? It was our duty to vote that the abolition\r\nof the Slave Trade should be immediate, and not to leave it to he knew\r\nnot what future time or contingency.\r\n\r\nHaving now done with the argument of expediency, he would consider the\r\nproposition of his right honourable friend Mr. Dundas; that, on account\r\nof some patrimonial rights of the West Indians, the prohibition of the\r\nSlave Trade would be an invasion of their legal inheritance. He would\r\nfirst observe, that, if this argument was worth anything, it applied\r\njust as much to gradual as to immediate abolition. He had no doubt,\r\nthat, at whatever period we should say the trade should cease; it would\r\nbe equally, set up; for it would certainly be just as good an argument\r\nagainst the measure in seventy years hence, as it was against it now. It\r\nimplied also, that Parliament had no right to stop the importations: but\r\nhad this detestable traffic received such a sanction, as placed it more\r\nout of the jurisdiction of the legislature for ever after, than any\r\nother branch of our trade? In what a situation did the proposition of\r\nhis honourable friend place the legislature of Great Britain! It was\r\nscarcely possible to lay a duty on anyone article, which might not in\r\nsomeway affect the property of individuals. But if the laws respecting\r\nthe Slave Trade implied a contract for its perpetual continuance, the\r\nHouse could never regulate any other of the branches of our national\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nBut any contract for the promotion of this trade must, in his opinion,\r\nhave been void from the beginning: for if it was an outrage upon\r\njustice, and only another name for fraud, robbery, and murder, what\r\npledge could devolve upon the legislature to incur the obligation of\r\nbecoming principals in the commission of such enormities by sanctioning\r\ntheir continuance?\r\n\r\nBut he would appeal to the acts themselves. That of 23 George II. c. 31,\r\nwas the one upon which the greatest stress was laid. How would the House\r\nbe surprised to hear that the very outrages committed in the prosecution\r\nof this trade had been forbidden by that act! \"No master of a ship\r\ntrading to Africa,\" says the act, \"shall by fraud, force, or violence,\r\nor by any indirect practice whatever, take on board or carry away from\r\nthat coast any Negro, or native of that country, or commit any violence\r\non the natives, to the prejudice of the said trade; and every person so\r\noffending, shall for every such offence forfeit one hundred pounds.\" But\r\nthe whole trade had been demonstrated to be a system of fraud, force,\r\nand violence; and therefore the contract was daily violated, under which\r\nthe Parliament allowed it to continue.\r\n\r\nBut why had the trade ever been permitted at all? The preamble of the\r\nact would show: \"Whereas the trade to and from Africa is very\r\nadvantageous to Great Britain, and necessary for supplying the\r\nPlantations and Colonies thereunto belonging with a sufficient number of\r\nNegroes at reasonable rates, and for that purpose the said trade should\r\nbe carried on.\"--Here then we might see what the Parliament had in view,\r\nwhen it passed this act. But no one of the occasions, on which it\r\ngrounded its proceedings, now existed. He would plead, then, the act\r\nitself as an argument for the abolition. If it had been proved that,\r\ninstead of being very advantageous to Great Britain, it was the most\r\ndestructive to her interests--that it was the ruin of her seamen--that\r\nit stopped the extension of her manufactures;--if it had been proved, in\r\nthe second place, that it was not now necessary for the supply of our\r\nPlantations with Negroes;--if it had been further established, that it\r\nwas from the beginning contrary to the first principles of justice, and\r\nconsequently that a pledge for its continuance, had one been attempted\r\nto be given, must have been absolutely void--where in this act of\r\nparliament was the contract to be found, by which Britain was bound, as\r\nshe was said to be, never to listen to her own true interests and to the\r\ncries of the natives of Africa? Was it not clear, that all argument,\r\nfounded on the supposed pledge of Parliament, made against those who\r\nemployed it?\r\n\r\nBut if we were not bound by existing laws to the support of this trade,\r\nwe were doubly criminal in pursuing it; for why ought it to be abolished\r\nat all? Because it was incurable injustice. Africa was the ground on\r\nwhich he chiefly rested; and there it was, that his two honourable\r\nfriends, one of whom had proposed gradual abolition, and the other\r\nregulation, did not carry their principles, to their full extent. Both\r\nhad confessed the trade to be a moral evil. How much stronger, then, was\r\nthe argument, for immediate than for gradual abolition! If on the ground\r\nof a moral evil it was to be abolished at last, why ought it not now?\r\nWhy was injustice to be suffered to remain for a single hour? He knew of\r\nno evil, which ever had existed, nor could he imagine any to exist,\r\nworse than the tearing of eighty thousand persons annually from their\r\nnative land, by a combination of the most civilized nations, in the most\r\nenlightened quarter of the globe; but more, especially by that nation,\r\nwhich called herself the most free and the most happy of them all.\r\n\r\nHe would now notice the objection, that other nations would not give up\r\nthe Slave Trade, if we were to renounce it. But if the trade were\r\nstained, but by a thousandth part of the criminality which he and\r\nothers, after a thorough investigation of the subject, charged upon it,\r\nthe House ought immediately to vote for its abolition. This miserable\r\nargument, if persevered in, would be an eternal bar to the annihilation\r\nof the evil. How was it ever to be eradicated, if every nation was thus\r\nprudentially to wait till the concurrence of all the world should be\r\nobtained! But it applied a thousand times more strongly in a contrary\r\nway. How much more justly would other nations say, \"Great Britain, free\r\nas she is, just and honourable as she is, not only has not abolished,\r\nbut has refused to abolish, the Slave Trade. She has investigated it\r\nwell. Her senate has deliberated upon it. It is plain, then, that she\r\nsees no guilt in it.\" With this argument we should furnish the other\r\nnations of Europe, if we were again to refuse to put an end to this\r\ncruel traffic; and we should have from henceforth not only to answer for\r\nour own, but for their crimes also. Already we have suffered one year to\r\npass away; and now, when the question was renewed, not only had this\r\nwretched argument been revived, but a proposition had been made for the\r\ngradual abolition of the trade. He knew, indeed, the difficulty of\r\nreforming long established abuses; but in the present case, by proposing\r\nsome other period than the present, by prescribing some condition, by\r\nwaiting for some contingencies, perhaps till we obtained the general\r\nconcurrence of Europe, (A concurrence which he believe never yet took\r\nplace at the commencement of any one improvement in policy or morals,)\r\nhe fared that this most enormous evil would never be redressed. Was it\r\nnot folly to wait for the stream to run down before we crossed the bed\r\nof its channel? Alas! we might wait for ever. The river would still flow\r\non. We should be no nearer the object which we had in view, so long as\r\nthe step, which could alone bring us to it was not taken.\r\n\r\nHe would now proceed to the civilization of Africa; and, as his eye had\r\njust glanced upon a West Indian law in the evidence upon the table, he\r\nwould begin with an argument, which the sight of it had suggested to\r\nhim. This argument had been ably answered in the course of the evening;\r\nbut he would view it in yet another light. It had been said, that the\r\nsavage disposition of the Africans rendered the prospect of their\r\ncivilization almost hopeless. This argument was indeed of long standing;\r\nbut, last year, it had been supported upon a new ground. Captain Frazer\r\nhad stated in his evidence, that a boy had been put to death at Cabenda,\r\nbecause there were those who refused to purchase him as a slave. This\r\nsingle story was deemed by him, and had been considered by others, as a\r\nsufficient proof of the barbarity of the Africans, and of the inutility\r\nof abolishing the Slave Trade. But they, who had used this fact, had\r\nsuppressed several circumstances relating to it. It appeared, on\r\nquestioning Captain Frazer afterward, that this boy had previously run\r\naway from his master three several times; that the master had to pay his\r\nvalue, according to the custom of the country, every time he was brought\r\nback; and that partly from anger at the boy for running away so\r\nfrequently, and partly to prevent a repetition of the same expense, he\r\ndetermined to destroy him. Such was the explanation of the signal\r\ninstance, which was to fix barbarity on all Africa, as it came out in\r\nthe cross-examination of Captain Frazer. That this African master was\r\nunenlightened and barbarous, he freely admitted; but what would an\r\nenlightened and civilized West Indian have done in a similar case? He\r\nwould quote the law, passed in the West Indies in 1722, which he had\r\njust cast his eye upon in the book of evidence, by which law this very\r\nsame crime of running away was by the legislature, of an island, by the\r\ngrave and deliberate sentence of an enlightened legislature, punished\r\nwith death; and this, not in the case only of the third offence, but\r\neven in the very first instance. It was enacted, \"That, if any Negro or\r\nother slave should withdraw himself from his master for the term of six\r\nmonths, or any slave, who was absent, should not return within that\r\ntime, every such person should suffer death.\" There was also another\r\nWest Indian law, by which every Negro was armed against his fellow\r\nNegro, for he was authorized to kill every runaway slave; and he had\r\neven a reward held out to him for so doing. Let the House now contrast\r\nthe two cases. Let them ask themselves which of the two exhibited the\r\ngreater barbarity; and whether they could possibly vote for the\r\ncontinuance of the Slave Trade, upon the principle that the Africans had\r\nshown themselves to be a race of incorrigible barbarians?\r\n\r\nSomething like an opposite argument, but with a like view, had been\r\nmaintained by others on this subject. It had been said, in justification\r\nof the trade, that the Africans had derived some little civilization\r\nfrom their intercourse with us. Yes; we had given them just enough of\r\nthe forms of justice to enable them to add the pretext of legal trials\r\nto their other modes of perpetrating the most atrocious crimes. We had\r\ngiven them just enough of European improvements, to enable them the more\r\neffectually to turn Africa into a ravaged wilderness. Alas! alas! we had\r\ncarried on a trade with them from this civilized and enlightened\r\ncountry, which, instead of diffusing knowledge, had been a check to\r\nevery laudable pursuit. We had carried a poison into their country,\r\nwhich spread its contagious effects from one end of it to the other, and\r\nwhich penetrated to its very centre, corrupting every part to which it\r\nreached. We had there subverted the whole order of nature; we had\r\naggravated every natural barbarity, and furnished to every man motives\r\nfor committing, under the name of trade, acts of perpetual hostility and\r\nperfidy against his neighbour. Thus had the perversion of British\r\ncommerce carried misery instead of happiness to one whole quarter of the\r\nglobe. False to the very principles of trade, misguided in our policy,\r\nunmindful of our duty, what almost irreparable mischief had we done to\r\nthat continent! How should we hope to obtain forgiveness from heaven, if\r\nwe refused to use those means which the mercy of Providence had still\r\nreserved to us for wiping away the guilt and shame, with which we were\r\nnow covered? If we refused even this degree of compensation, how\r\naggravated would be our guilt! Should we delay, then, to repair these\r\nincalculable injuries? We ought to count the days, nay the very hours,\r\nwhich intervened to delay the accomplishment of such a work.\r\n\r\nOn this great subject, the civilization of Africa, which, he confessed,\r\nwas near his heart, he would yet add a few observations. And first he\r\nwould say, that the present deplorable state of that country, especially\r\nwhen we reflected that her chief calamities were to be ascribed to us,\r\ncalled for our generous aid, rather than justified any despair, on our\r\npart, of her recovery, and still less a repetition of our injuries. On\r\nwhat ground of theory or history did we act, when we supposed she was\r\nnever to be reclaimed? There was a time, which it might be now fit to\r\ncall to remembrance, when human sacrifices, and even this very practice\r\nof the Slave Trade existed in our own island. Slaves, as we may read in\r\nHENRY's _History of Great Britain_, were formerly an established article\r\nof our exports. \"Great numbers,\" he says, \"were exported like cattle\r\nfrom the British coast, and were to be seen exposed for sale in the\r\nRoman markets.\"--\"Adultery, witchcraft, and debt,\" says the same\r\nhistorian, \"were probably some of the chief sources of supplying the\r\nRoman market with British slaves--prisoners taken in war were added to\r\nthe number--there might be also among them some unfortunate gamesters,\r\nwho, after having lost all their goods, at length staked themselves,\r\ntheir wives, and their children.\" Now every one of these sources of\r\nslavery had been stated to be at this hour a source of slavery in\r\nAfrica. If these practices, therefore, were to be admitted as proofs of\r\nthe natural incapacity of its inhabitants, why might they not have been\r\napplied to ancient Britain? Why might not then some Roman senator,\r\npointing to British barbarians, have predicted with equal boldness, that\r\nthese were a people who were destined never to be free; who were without\r\nthe understanding necessary for the attainment of useful arts; depressed\r\nby the hand of nature below the level of the human species, and created\r\nto form a supply of slaves for the rest of the world? But, happily,\r\nsince that time, notwithstanding what would then have been the justness\r\nof these predictions, we had emerged from barbarism. We were now raised\r\nto a situation which exhibited a striking contrast to every circumstance\r\nby which a Roman might have characterized us, and by which we now\r\ncharacterized Africa. There was indeed one thing wanting to complete the\r\ncontrast, and to clear us altogether from the imputation of acting even\r\nto this hour as barbarians; for we continued to this hour a barbarous\r\ntraffic in slaves; we continued it even yet, in spite of all our great\r\npretensions. We were once as obscure among the nations of the earth, as\r\nsavage in our manners, as debased in our morals, as degraded in our\r\nunderstandings, as these unhappy Africans. But in the lapse of a long\r\nseries of years, by a progression slow, and for a time almost\r\nimperceptible, we had become rich in a variety of acquirements. We were\r\nfavoured above measure in the gifts of Providence, we were unrivalled in\r\ncommerce, pre-eminent in arts, foremost in the pursuits of philosophy\r\nand science, and established in all the blessings of civil society; we\r\nwere in the possession of peace, of liberty, and of happiness; we were\r\nunder the guidance of a mild and a beneficent religion; and we were\r\nprotected by impartial laws and the purest administration of justice; we\r\nwere living under a system of government, which our own happy experience\r\nled us to pronounce the best and wisest, and which had become the\r\nadmiration of the World. From all these blessings we must for ever have\r\nbeen excluded, had there been any truth in those principles, which some\r\nhad not hesitated to lay down as applicable to the case of Africa; and\r\nwe should have been at this moment little superior, either in morals,\r\nknowledge, or refinement, to the rude inhabitants of that continent.\r\n\r\nIf then we felt that this perpetual confinement in the fetters of brutal\r\nignorance would have been the greatest calamity which could have\r\nbefallen us; if we viewed with gratitude the contrast between our\r\npresent and our former situation; if we shuddered to think of the misery\r\nwhich would still have overwhelmed us, had our country continued to the\r\npresent times, through some cruel policy, to be the mart for slaves to\r\nthe more civilized nations of the World;--God forbid that we should any\r\nlonger subject Africa to the same dreadful scourge, and exclude the\r\nsight of knowledge from her coasts, which had reached every other\r\nquarter of the globe!\r\n\r\nHe trusted we should no longer continue this commerce, and that we\r\nshould no longer consider ourselves as conferring too great a boon on\r\nthe natives of Africa in restoring them to the rank of human beings, He\r\ntrusted we should not think ourselves too liberal, if, by abolishing the\r\nSlave Trade, we gave them the same common chance of civilization with\r\nother parts of the World. If we listened to the voice of reason and duty\r\nthis night, some of us might live to see a reverse of that picture, from\r\nwhich we how turned our eyes with shame. We might live to behold the\r\nnatives engaged in the calm occupations of industry, and in the pursuit\r\nof a just commerce. We might behold the beams of science and philosophy\r\nbreaking in upon their land, which at some happy period in still later\r\ntimes might blaze with full lustre; and joining their influence to that\r\nof pure religion, might illuminate and invigorate the most distant\r\nextremities of that immense continent. Then might we hope, that even\r\nAfrica (though last of all the quarters of the globe) should enjoy at\r\nlength, in the evening of her days, those blessings, which had descended\r\nso plentifully upon us in a much earlier period of the world. Then also\r\nwould Europe, participating in her improvement and prosperity, receive\r\nan ample recompense for the tardy kindness (if kindness it could be\r\ncalled) of no longer hindering her from extricating herself out of the\r\ndarkness, which, in other more fortunate regions, had been so much more\r\nspeedily dispelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n      --------Nos primus equis Oriens afflavit anhelis;\r\n      Illìc sera rubens accendit lumina Vesper.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen might be applied to Africa those words, originally used indeed with\r\na different view:\r\n\r\n\r\n      His demùm exactis------\r\n      Devenere locos laetos, et amoena vireta\r\n      Fortunatorum nemorum, sedesque beatas;\r\n      Largior hìc campos aether et lumine vestit\r\n      Purpureo.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in this view--it was as an atonement for our long and cruel\r\ninjustice towards Africa, that the measure proposed by his honourable\r\nfriend Mr. Wilberforce most forcibly recommended itself to his mind. The\r\ngreat and happy change to be expected in the state of her inhabitants\r\nwas, of all the various benefits of the abolition, in his estimation the\r\nmost extensive and important. He should vote against the adjournment;\r\nand he should also oppose every proposition which tended either to\r\nprevent, or even to postpone for an hour, the total abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt having concluded his speech (at about six in the morning), Sir\r\nWilliam Dolben, the chairman, proposed the following questions:--The\r\nfirst was on the motion of Mr. Jenkinson, \"that the chairman do now\r\nleave the chair.\" This was lost by a majority of two hundred and\r\nthirty-four to eighty-seven. The second was on the motion of Mr. Dundas,\r\n\"that the abolition should be, gradual;\" when the votes for gradual\r\nexceeded those for immediate by one hundred and ninety-three to one\r\nhundred and twenty-five. He then put the amended question, that \"it was\r\nthe opinion of the committee that the trade ought to be gradually\r\nabolished.\"  The committee having divided again, the votes for a gradual\r\nabolition were, two hundred and thirty, and those against any abolition\r\nwere eighty-five.\r\n\r\nAfter this debate, the committee for the abolition of the Slave Trade\r\nheld a meeting. They voted their thanks to Mr. Wilberforce for his\r\nmotion, and to Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, and those other members of the House\r\nwho had supported it. They resolved, also, that the House of Commons,\r\nhaving determined that the Slave Trade ought to be gradually abolished,\r\nhad by that decision manifested their opinion, that it was cruel and\r\nunjust. They resolved, also, that a gradual abolition of it was not an\r\nadequate remedy for its injustice and cruelty; neither could it be\r\ndeemed a compliance with the general wishes of the people, as expressed\r\nin their numerous and urgent petitions to Parliament; and they resolved\r\nlastly, that the interval in which the Slave Trade should be permitted\r\nto continue, afforded a prospect of redoubled cruelties and ravages on\r\nthe coast of Africa; and that it imposed therefore an additional\r\nobligation on every friend to the cause to use all constitutional means\r\nto obtain its immediate abolition.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent meeting they voted their thanks to the right honourable\r\nLord Muncaster, for the able support he had given to the great object of\r\ntheir institution by his _Historical Sketches of the Slave Trade, and of\r\nits Effects in Africa_; addressed to the people of Great Britain; and\r\nthey elected the Rev. Richard Gifford, and the Rev. Thomas Gisborne,\r\nhonorary and corresponding members; the first on account of his\r\nexcellent sermon before-mentioned, and other services; and the latter on\r\naccount of his truly Christian and seasonable pamphlet, entitled\r\n_Remarks on the Late Decision of the House of Commons, respecting the\r\nAbolition of the Slave Trade_.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of April, the House of Commons resolved itself into a\r\ncommittee of the whole House, to consider the subject again; and Mr.\r\nBeaufoy was put into the chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Dundas, upon whom the task of introducing a bill for the gradual\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade now devolved, rose to offer the outlines of\r\na plan for that purpose. He intended, he said, immediately to abolish\r\nthat part of the trade, by which we supplied foreigners with slaves. The\r\nother part of it was to be continued seven years from the 1st of January\r\nnext. He grounded the necessity of its continuance till this time upon\r\nthe documents of the Negro population in the different islands. In many\r\nof these, slaves were imported, but they were re-exported nearly in\r\nequal numbers. Now, all these he considered to be in a state to go on\r\nwithout future supplies from Africa. Jamaica and the ceded islands\r\nretained almost all the slaves imported into them. This he considered as\r\na proof that these had not attained the same desirable state; and it was\r\ntherefore necessary, that the trade should be continued longer on this\r\naccount. It was his intention, however, to provide proper punishments,\r\nwhile it lasted, for abuses both in Africa and in the Middle Passage, He\r\nwould take care, as far as he could, that none but young slaves should\r\nbe brought from the Coast of Africa. He would encourage establishments\r\nthere for a new species of traffic. Foreign nations should be invited to\r\nconcur in the abolition. He should propose a praedial rather than a\r\npersonal service for the West Indies, and institutions, by which the\r\nslaves there should be instructed in religious duties. He concluded by\r\nreading several resolutions, which he would leave to the future\r\nconsideration of the House.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt then rose. He deprecated the resolutions altogether. He denied\r\nalso the inferences which Mr. Dundas had drawn from the West Indian\r\ndocuments relative to the Negro population. He had looked aver his own\r\ncalculations from the same documents again and again, and he would\r\nsubmit them, with all their data, if it should be necessary, to the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilberforce and Mr. Fox held the same language. They contended also,\r\nthat Mr. Dundas had now proved, a thousand times more strongly than\r\never, the necessity of immediate abolition. All the resolutions he had\r\nread were operative against his own reasoning. The latter observed, that\r\nthe Slave-traders were in future only to be allowed to steal innocent\r\nchildren from their disconsolate parents.\r\n\r\nAfter a few observations by Lord Sheffield, Mr. Drake, Colonel Tarleton,\r\nand Mr. Rolle, the House adjourned.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of April it resumed the consideration of the subject. Mr.\r\nDundas then went over his former resolutions, and concluded by moving,\r\n\"that it should not be lawful to import any African Negroes into any\r\nBritish colonies, in ships owned or navigated by British subjects, at\r\nany time after the 1st of January, 1800.\"\r\n\r\nLord Mornington (now Marquis Wellesley) rose to propose an amendment. He\r\ncongratulated his countrymen, that the Slave Trade had received its\r\ndeath-wound. This traffic was founded in injustice; and between right\r\nand wrong there could be no compromise. Africa was not to be sacrificed\r\nto the apparent good of the West Indies. He would not repeat those\r\nenormities out of the evidence, which had made such a deep impression\r\nupon the House. It had been resolved, that the trade should be\r\nabolished. The question then was, how long they were to persevere in the\r\ncrime of its continuance? One had said, that they might be unjust for\r\nten years longer; another, only till the beginning of the next century.\r\nBut this diversity of opinion had proceeded from an erroneous statement\r\nof Mr. Dundas against the clear and irrefragable calculations of Mr.\r\nPitt. The former had argued, that, because Jamaica and the ceded islands\r\nhad retained almost all the slaves which had been, imported into them,\r\nthey were therefore not yet in a situation to support their population\r\nwithout further supplies from Africa. But the truth was, that the\r\nslaves, so retained, were kept, not to maintain the population there,\r\nbut to clear new land. Now the House had determined, that the trade was\r\nnot to be continued for this purpose. The population, therefore, in the\r\nislands was sufficient to continue the ordinary cultivation of them.\r\n\r\nHe deprecated the idea, that the Slave Trade had been so sanctioned by\r\nthe acts of former Parliaments, that the present could make no\r\nalteration in it. Had not the House altered the import of foreign sugar\r\ninto our islands? a measure, which at the time affected the property of\r\nmany. Had they not prohibited the exports of provisions from America to\r\nthe same quarter; Again, as to compacts, had the Africans ever been\r\nparties to these? It was rather curious also, when King James the Second\r\ngave a charter to the slave-trader, that he should have given them a\r\nright to all the south of Africa, and authority over every person born\r\ntherein! But, by doing this, it was clear that he gave them a right\r\nwhich he never possessed himself. After many other observations, he\r\nconcluded by moving, \"that the year 1793 be substituted in the place of\r\nthe year 1800.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate, which followed, Mr. Burdon stated his\r\nconviction of the necessity of immediate abolition; but he would support\r\nthe amendment, as the shortest of the terms proposed.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Thornton would support it also, as the only choice left him.\r\nHe dared not accede to a motion, by which we were to continue for seven\r\nyears to imbrue our hands in innocent blood.\r\n\r\nMr. Ryder (now Earl of Harrowby) would not support the trade for one\r\nmoment, if he could avoid it. He could not hold a balance with gold in\r\none scale, and blood in the other.\r\n\r\nMr. William Smith exposed the wickedness of restricting the trade to\r\ncertain ages. The original motion, he said, would only operate as a\r\ntransfer of cruelty from the aged and the guilty to the young and the\r\ninnocent. He entreated the House to consider, whether, if it related to\r\ntheir own children, any one of them would vote for it.\r\n\r\nMr. Windham had hitherto felt a reluctance to speaking, not from the\r\nabstruseness, but from the simplicity, of the subject; but he could not\r\nlonger be silent, when he observed those arguments of policy creeping\r\nagain out of their lurking-places, which had fled before eloquence and\r\ntruth. The House had clearly given up the policy of the question. They\r\nhad been determined by the justice of it. Why were they then to be\r\ntroubled again with arguments of this nature? These, if admitted, would\r\ngo to the subversion of all public as well as private morality. Nations\r\nwere as much bound as individuals to a system of morals, though a breach\r\nin the former could not be so easily punished. In private life morality\r\ntook pretty good care of itself. It was a kind of retail article, in\r\nwhich the returns were speedy. If a man broke open his neighbour's\r\nhouse, he would feel the consequences.  There was an ally of virtue, who\r\nrendered it the interest of individuals to be moral, and he was called\r\nthe executioner. But as such punishment did not always await us in our\r\nnational concerns, we should substitute honour as the guardian of our\r\nnational conduct. He hoped the West Indians would consider the character\r\nof the mother-country, and the obligations to national as well as\r\nindividual justice. He hoped, also, they would consider the sufferings,\r\nwhich they occasioned both in Africa, in the passage, and in the West\r\nIndies. In the passage, indeed, no one was capable of describing them.\r\nThe section of the slave-ship; however, made up the deficiency of\r\nlanguage, and did away all necessity of argument, on this subject.\r\nDisease there had to struggle with the new affliction of chains and\r\npunishment. At one view were the irksomeness of a goal, and the miseries\r\nof an hospital; so that the holds of these vessels put him in mind of\r\nthe regions of the damned. The trade, he said, ought immediately to be\r\nabolished. On a comparison of the probable consequences of the abolition\r\nof it, he saw on one side only doubtful contingencies, but on the other\r\nshame and disgrace.\r\n\r\nSir James Johnstone contended for the immediate abolition of the trade.\r\nHe had introduced the plough into his own plantation in the West Indies,\r\nand he found the land produced more sugar than when cultivated in the\r\nordinary way by slaves. Even for the sake of the planters, he hoped the\r\nabolition would not be long delayed.\r\n\r\nMr. Dundas replied: after which a division took place. The number of\r\nvotes in favour of the original motion were one hundred and fifty-eight,\r\nand for the amendment one hundred and nine.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of April the House resumed the subject. Mr. Dundas moved, as\r\nbefore, that the Slave Trade should cease in the year 1800; upon which\r\nLord Mornington moved, that the year 1795 should be substituted for the\r\nlatter period.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate, which followed, Mr. Hubbard said, that he\r\nhad voted against the abolition, when the year 1793 was proposed; but he\r\nthought that, if it were not to take place till 1795, sufficient time\r\nwould be allowed the planters. He would support this amendment; and he\r\ncongratulated the House on the prospect of the final triumph of truth,\r\nhumanity, and justice.\r\n\r\nMr. Addington preferred the year 1796 to the year 1795.\r\n\r\nMr. Alderman Watson considered the abolition in 1796, to be as\r\ndestructive as if it were immediate.\r\n\r\nA division having taken place, the number of votes in favour of the\r\noriginal motion were one hundred and sixty-one, and in favour of Lord\r\nMornington's amendment for the year 1795, one hundred and twenty-one.\r\nSir Edward Knatchbull, however, seeing that there was a disposition in\r\nthe House to bring the matter to a conclusion, and that a middle line\r\nwould be preferred, moved that the year 1796 should be substituted for\r\nthis year 1800. Upon this the House divided again; when there appeared\r\nfor the original motion only one hundred and thirty-two, but for the\r\namendment one hundred and fifty-one.\r\n\r\nThe gradual abolition having been now finally agreed upon for the year\r\n1796, a committee was named, which carried the resolution to the Lords.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May, the Lords were summoned to consider it; Lord\r\nStormont, after having spoken for some time, moved, that they should\r\nhear evidence upon it. Lord Grenville opposed the motion on account of\r\nthe delay, which would arise from an examination of the witnesses by the\r\nHouse at large: but he moved that such witnesses should be examined by a\r\ncommittee of the House. Upon this a debate ensued, and afterwards a\r\ndivision; when the original motion was carried by sixty-three against\r\nthirty-six.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May, the Lords met again. Evidence was then ordered to be\r\nsummoned in behalf of those interested in the continuance of the trade.\r\nAt length it was introduced; but on the 5th of June, when only seven\r\npersons had been examined, a motion was made and carried, that the\r\nfurther examinations should be postponed to the next session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nContinuation from July 1792 to July 1793.--Author travels round the\r\nkingdom again.--Motion to renew the resolution of the last year in the\r\nCommons; motion lost.--New motion in the Commons to abolish the\r\nforeign Slave Trade; motion lost.--Proceedings of the Lords.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolution adopted by the Commons, that the trade should cease in\r\n1796, was a matter of great joy to many; and several, in consequence of\r\nit, returned to the use of sugar. The committee, however, for the\r\nabolition did not view it in the same favourable light. They considered\r\nit as a political manoeuvre to frustrate the accomplishment of the\r\nobject. But the circumstance, which gave them the most concern, was the\r\nresolution of the Lords to hear evidence. It was impossible now to say,\r\nwhen the trade would cease, the witnesses in behalf of the merchants and\r\nplanters, had obtained possession of the ground; and they might, keep\r\nit, if they chose, even till the year 1800, to throw light upon a\r\nmeasure which was to be adopted in 1796. The committee found too, that\r\nthey had again the laborious task before them of finding out new persons\r\nto give testimony in behalf of their cause; for some of their former\r\nwitnesses were dead, and others were out of the kingdom; and unless they\r\nreplaced these, there would be no probability of making out that strong\r\ncase in the Lords, which they had established in the Commons. It\r\ndevolved therefore upon me once more to travel for this purpose: but as\r\nI was then in too weak a state to bear as much fatigue as formerly, Dr.\r\nDickson relieved me, by taking one part of the tour, namely, that to\r\nScotland, upon himself.\r\n\r\nThese journeys we performed with considerable success; during which, the\r\ncommittee elected Mr. Joseph Townsend of Baltimore, in Maryland, an\r\nhonorary and corresponding member.\r\n\r\nParliament having met, Mr. Wilberforce, in February 1793, moved, that\r\nthe House resolve itself into a committee of the whole House on Thursday\r\nnext, to consider of the circumstances of the Slave Trade. This motion\r\nwas opposed by Sir William Yonge, who moved, that this day six months\r\nshould be substituted for Thursday next. A debate ensued: of this,\r\nhowever, as well as of several which followed. I shall give no account;\r\nas it would be tedious to the reader to hear a repetition of the same\r\narguments. Suffice it to say, that the motion was lost by a majority of\r\nsixty-one to fifty-three.\r\n\r\nThis sudden refusal of the House of Commons to renew their own vote of\r\nthe former year, gave great uneasiness to the friends of the cause. Mr.\r\nWilberforce, however, resolved that the session should not pass without\r\nan attempt to promote it in another form; and accordingly, on the 14th\r\nof May, he moved for leave to bring in a bill to abolish that part of\r\nthe Slave Trade, by which the British merchants supplied foreigners with\r\nslaves. This motion was opposed like the former; but was carried by a\r\nmajority of seven. The bill was then brought in; and it passed its first\r\nand second reading with little opposition; but on the 5th of June,\r\nnotwithstanding the eloquence of Mr. Pitt and of Mr. Fox, and the very\r\nable speeches of Mr. Francis, Mr. Courtenay, and others, it was lost by\r\na majority of thirty-one to twenty-nine.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between these motions, the question experienced in the\r\nLords considerable opposition. The Duke of Clarence moved that the House\r\nshould not proceed in the consideration of the Slave Trade till after\r\nthe Easter recess. The Earl of Abingdon was still more hostile\r\nafterwards. He deprecated the new philosophy. It was as full of mischief\r\nas the Box of Pandora. The doctrine of the abolition of the Slave Trade\r\nwas a species of it; and he concluded by moving, that all further\r\nconsideration of the subject be postponed. To the epithets, then\r\nbestowed upon the abolitionists by this nobleman, the Duke of Clarence\r\nadded those of fanatics and hypocrites, among whom he included Mr.\r\nWilberforce by name. All the other Lords, however, who were present,\r\nmanifested such a dislike to the sentiments of the Earl of Abingdon,\r\nthat he withdrew his motion.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the hearing of evidence on the resolution of the House of\r\nCommons was resumed; and seven persons were examined before the close of\r\nthe session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n--Continuation from July 1793 to July 1794.--Author travels round the\r\nkingdom again.--Motion to abolish the foreign Slave Trade renewed in\r\nthe Commons; and carried; but lost in the Lords; further proceedings\r\nthere.--Author, on account of his declining health, obliged to retire\r\nfrom the cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe committee for the abolition could not view the proceedings of both\r\nHouses of Parliament on this subject during the year 1793, without being\r\nalarmed for the fate of their question. The only two sources of hope,\r\nwhich they could discover, were in the disposition then manifested by\r\nthe Peers, as to the conduct of the Earl of Abingdon, and in their\r\ndetermination to proceed in the hearing of evidence. The latter\r\ncircumstance indeed was the more favourable, as the resolution, upon\r\nwhich the witnesses were to be examined, had not been renewed by the\r\nCommons. These considerations, however, afforded no solid ground for the\r\nmind to rest upon. They only broke in upon it, like faint gleams of\r\nsunshine, for a moment, and then were gone. In this situation, the\r\ncommittee could only console themselves by the reflection, that they had\r\ndone their duty. In looking, however, to their future services, one\r\nthing, and only one, seemed practicable; and this was necessary; namely,\r\nto complete the new body of evidence, which they had endeavoured to form\r\nin the preceding year. The determination to do this rendered another\r\njourney on my part indispensable; and I undertook it, broken down, as my\r\nconstitution then was, beginning it in September 1793, and completing it\r\nin February 1794.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilberforce, in this interval, had digested his plan of operations;\r\nand accordingly, early in the session of 1794, he asked leave to renew\r\nhis former bill, to abolish that part of the trade, by means of which\r\nBritish merchants supplied foreigners with slaves. This request was\r\nopposed by Sir William Yonge; but it was granted; on a division of the\r\nHouse, by a majority of sixty-three to forty votes.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill was brought in, it was opposed by the same member; upon\r\nwhich the House divided; and there appeared for Sir William Yonge's\r\namendment thirty-eight votes, but against it fifty-six.\r\n\r\nOn a motion for the recommitment of the bill, Lord Sheffield divided the\r\nHouse, against whose motion there was a majority of forty-two. And, on\r\nthe third reading of it, it was opposed again; but it was at length\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nThe speakers against the bill were: Sir William Yonge, Lord Sheffield,\r\nColonel Tarleton, Alderman Newnham and Messrs; Payne, Este, Lechaiere,\r\nCawthorae, Jenkinson, and Dent. Those who spoke in favour of it were:\r\nMessrs. Pitt, Fox, William Smith, Whitbread, Francis, Burdon, Vaughan,\r\nBarham, and Serjeants Watson and Adair.\r\n\r\nWhile the foreign Slave-bill was thus passing through its stages in the\r\nCommons, Dr. Horsley, Bishop of Rochester, who saw no end to the\r\nexaminations, while the witnesses were to be examined at the bar of the\r\nHouse of Lords, moved, that they should be taken in future before a\r\ncommittee above-stairs. Dr. Porteus, Bishop of London, and the Lords\r\nGuildford, Stanhope, and Grenville, supported this motion. But the Lord\r\nChancellor Thurlow, aided by the Duke of Clarence, and by the Lords\r\nMansfield, Hay, Abingdon, and others, negatived it by a majority of\r\ntwenty-eight.\r\n\r\nAt length the bill itself was ushered into the House of Lords. On\r\nreading it a second time, it was opposed by the Duke of Clarence, Lord\r\nAbingdon, and others. Lord Grenville and the Bishop of Rochester\r\ndeclined supporting it. They alleged as a reason, that they conceived\r\nthe introduction of it to have been improper, pending the inquiry on the\r\ngeneral subject of the Slave Trade. This declaration brought up the\r\nLords Stanhope and Lauderdale, who charged them with inconsistency as\r\nprofessed friends of the cause. At length the bill was lost. During\r\nthese discussions the examination of the witnesses was resumed by the\r\nLords; but only two of them were heard in this session[A].\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: After this the examinations wholly dropped in the House of\r\nLords.]\r\n\r\nAfter this decision the question was in a desperate state; for if the\r\nCommons would not renew their own resolution, and the Lords would not\r\nabolish the foreign part of the Slave-trade, what hope was there of\r\nsuccess? It was obvious too, that in the former House, Mr. Pitt and Mr.\r\nDundas voted against each other. In the latter, the Lord Chancellor\r\nThurlow opposed every motion in favour of the cause. The committee\r\ntherefore were reduced to this;--either they must exert themselves\r\nwithout hope, or they must wait till some change should take place in\r\ntheir favour. As far as I myself was concerned, all exertion was then\r\nover. The nervous system was almost shattered to pieces. Both my memory\r\nand my hearing failed me. Sudden dizzinesses seized my head. A confused\r\nsinging in the ears followed me, wherever I went. On going to bed the\r\nvery, stairs seemed to dance up and down under me, so that, misplacing\r\nmy foot, I sometimes fell. Talking too, if it continued but half an\r\nhour, exhausted me, so that profuse perspirations followed; and the same\r\neffect was produced even by an active exertion of the mind for the like\r\ntime. These disorders had been brought on by degrees in consequence of\r\nthe severe labours necessarily attached to the promotion of the cause.\r\nFor seven years I had a correspondence to maintain with four hundred\r\npersons with my own hand. I had some book or other annually to write in\r\nbehalf of the cause. In this time I had travelled more than thirty-five\r\nthousand miles in search of evidence, and a great part of these journeys\r\nin the night. All this time my mind had been on the stretch. It had been\r\nbent too to this one subject; for I had not even leisure to attend to my\r\nown concerns. The various instances of barbarity, which had come\r\nsuccessively to my knowledge within this period, had vexed, harassed,\r\nand afflicted it. The wound which these had produced, was rendered still\r\ndeeper by those cruel disappointments before related, which arose from\r\nthe reiterated refusal of persons to give their testimony, after I had\r\ntravelled hundreds of miles in quest of them. But the severest stroke\r\nwas that inflicted by the persecution, begun and pursued by persons\r\ninterested in the continuance of the trade, of such witnesses as had\r\nbeen examined against them; and whom, on account of their dependent\r\nsituation in life, it was most easy to oppress. As I had been the means\r\nof bringing these forward on these occasions, they naturally came to me,\r\nwhen thus persecuted, as the author of their miseries and their ruin.\r\nFrom their supplications and wants it would have been ungenerous and\r\nungrateful to have fled[A]. These different circumstances, by acting\r\ntogether, had at length brought me into the situation just mentioned;\r\nand I was therefore obliged, though very reluctantly, to be borne out of\r\nthe field, where I had placed the great honour and glory of my life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The late Mr. Whitbread, to whom one day in deep affliction\r\non this account I related accidentally a circumstance of this kind,\r\ngenerously undertook, in order to make my mind easy upon the subject, to\r\nmake good all injuries, which should in future arise to individuals from\r\nsuch persecution; and he repaired these, at different times, at a\r\nconsiderable expense. I feel it a duty to divulge this circumstance, out\r\nof respect to the memory of one of the best of men, and of one, whom, if\r\nthe history of his life were written, it would appear to have been an\r\nextraordinary honour to the country to have produced.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nContinuation from July 1794 to July 1799.--Various motions within this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\nI purpose, though it may seem abrupt after the division which has\r\nhitherto been made of the contents of this volume, to throw the events\r\nof the next five years into one chapter.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilberforce and the members of the committee, whose constitutions\r\nhad not suffered like my own, were still left; and they determined to\r\npersevere in the promotion of their great object as long as their health\r\nand their faculties permitted them. The former, accordingly, in the\r\nmonth of February, 1795, moved in the House of Commons for leave to\r\nbring in a bill for the abolition of the Slave Trade. This motion was\r\nthen necessary, if, according to the resolution of that House, the Slave\r\nTrade was to cease in 1796. It was opposed, however, by Sir William\r\nYonge, and unfortunately lost by a majority of seventy-eight to\r\nfifty-seven.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1796, Mr. Wilberforce renewed his efforts in the Commons. He\r\nasked leave to bring in a bill for the abolition of the Slave Trade, but\r\nin a limited time. The motion was opposed as before; but on a division,\r\nthere were for it ninety-three, and against it only sixty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe bill having been brought in, was opposed in its second reading; but\r\nit was carried through it by a majority of sixty-four to thirty-one.\r\n\r\nIn a future stage it was opposed again; but it triumphed by a majority\r\nof seventy-six to thirty-one. Mr. Elliott was then put into the chair.\r\nSeveral clauses were adopted; and the first of March, 1797, was fixed\r\nfor the abolition of the Trade: but in the next stage of it, after a\r\nlong speech from Mr. Dundas, it was lost by a majority of seventy-four\r\nagainst seventy.\r\n\r\nMr. Francis, who had made a brilliant speech in the last debate,\r\nconsidering that nothing effectual had been yet done on this great\r\nquestion, and wishing that a practical beginning might be made, brought\r\nforward soon afterwards, a motion relative to the improvement of the\r\ncondition of the slaves in the West Indies. This, after a short debate,\r\nwas negatived without a division. Mr. William Smith also moved an\r\naddress to His Majesty, that he would be pleased to give directions to\r\nlay before the House copies of the several acts relative to regulations\r\nin behalf of the slaves, passed by the different colonial assemblies\r\nsince the year 1788. This motion was adopted by the House. Thus passed\r\naway the session of 1796.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1797, while Mr. Wilberforce was deliberating upon the best\r\nmeasure for the advancement of the cause, Mr. C. Ellis came forward with\r\na new motion. He began by declaring, that he agreed with the\r\nabolitionists as to their object; but he differed with them as to the\r\nmode of attaining It. The Slave Trade he condemned as a cruel and\r\npernicious system; but, as it had become an inveterate evil, he feared\r\nit could not be done away all at once, without injury to the interests\r\nof numerous individuals, and even to the Negroes themselves. He\r\nconcluded by moving an address to His Majesty, humbly requesting, that\r\nhe would give directions to the governors of the West Indian islands, to\r\nrecommend it to the colonial assemblies to adopt such measures as might\r\nappear to them best calculated to ameliorate the condition of the\r\nNegroes, and thereby to remove gradually the Slave Trade; and likewise\r\nto assure His Majesty of the readiness of this House to concur in any\r\nmeasure to accelerate this desirable object; This motion was seconded by\r\nMr. Barham, It was opposed, however, by Mr. Wilberforce, Mr. Pitt, and\r\nothers; but was at length carried by a majority of ninety-nine to\r\nsixty-three.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1798, Mr. Wilberforce asked leave to renew his former bill,\r\nto abolish the Slave Trade within a limited time. He was supported by\r\nMr. Canning, Mr. Hobhouse, Sir Robert Buxton, Mr. Bouverie, and others.\r\nMessrs. Sewell, Bryan Edwards, Henniker, and C. Ellis, took the opposite\r\nside of the question. Mr. Ellis, however, observed, that he had no\r\nobjection to restricting the Slave Trade to plantations already begun in\r\nthe colonies; and Mr. Barham professed; himself a friend to the\r\nabolition, if it; could be accomplished in a reasonable way. On a\r\ndivision, there appeared to be for Mr. Wilberforce's motion\r\neighty-three, but against it eighty-seven.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1799 Mr. Wilberforce, undismayed by these different\r\ndisappointments, renewed his motion. Colonel M. Wood, Mr. Petrie, and\r\nothers, among whom were Mr. Windham and Mr. Dundas, opposed it. Mr.\r\nPitt, Mr. Fox, Mr. W. Smith, Sir William Dolben, Sir R. Milbank, Mr.\r\nHobhouse, and Mr. Canning, supported it. Sir R. Milbank contended, that\r\nmodifications of a system, fundamentally wrong, ought not to be\r\ntolerated by the legislature of a free nation, Mr. Hobhouse said, that\r\nnothing could be so nefarious as this traffic in blood. It was unjust in\r\nits principles it was cruel in its practice: it admitted of no\r\nregulation whatever. The abolition of it was called for equally, by\r\nmorality and sound policy, Mr. Canning exposed the folly of Mr. Dundas,\r\nwho bad said, that as Parliament had, in the year 1787, left the\r\nabolition to the colonial assemblies, it ought not to be taken out of\r\ntheir hands. This great event, he observed, could only be accomplished\r\nin two ways; either by these assemblies, or by the Parliament of\r\nEngland. Now the members of the Assembly of Jamaica had professed that\r\nthey would never abolish the trade. Was it not, therefore, idle to rely\r\nupon them for the accomplishment of it? He then took a very\r\ncomprehensive view of the arguments, which had been offered in the\r\ncourse of the debate, and was severe upon the planters in the House,\r\nwho, he said, had brought into familiar use certain expressions, with no\r\nother view than to throw a veil over their odious system. Among these\r\nwas, \"their right to import labourers.\" But never was the word\r\n\"labourers\" so prostituted, as when it was used for slaves. Never was\r\nthe word \"right\" so prostituted, not even when \"the rights of man\" were\r\ntalked of; as when the right to trade in man's blood was asserted, by\r\nthe members of an enlightened assembly. Never was the right of importing\r\nthese labourers worse defended than when the antiquity, of the Slave\r\nTrade, and its foundation on the ancient acts of parliament, were\r\nbrought forward in its support. We had been cautioned not to lay our\r\nunhallowed hands on the ancient institution of the Slave Trade; nor to\r\nsubvert a fabric, raised by the wisdom of our ancestors, and consecrated\r\nby a lapse of ages. But on what principles did we usually respect the\r\ninstitutions of antiquity? We respected them, when we saw some shadow of\r\ndeparted worth and usefulness; or some memorial of what had been\r\ncreditable to mankind. But was this the case with the Slave Trade? Had\r\nit begun in principles of justice or national honour, which the changes\r\nof the world alone had impaired? Had it to plead former services and\r\nglories in behalf of its present disgrace? In looking at it we saw\r\nnothing but crimes and sufferings from the beginning--nothing but what\r\nwounded and convulsed our feelings--nothing but what excited indignation\r\nand horror. It had not even to plead what could often be said in favour\r\nof the most unjustifiable wars. Though conquest had sometimes originated\r\nin ambition, and in the worst of motives, yet the conquerors and the\r\nconquered were sometimes blended afterwards into one people; so that a\r\nsystem of common interest arose out of former differences. But where was\r\nthe analogy of the eases? Was it only at the outset that we could trace\r\nviolence and injustice on the part of the Slave Trade? Were the\r\noppressors and the oppressed so reconciled, that enmities ultimately\r\nceased? No. Was it reasonable then to urge a prescriptive right, not to\r\nthe fruits of an ancient and forgotten evil, but to a series of new\r\nviolences; to a chain of fresh enormities; to cruelties continually\r\nrepeated; and of which every instance inflicted a fresh calamity, and\r\nconstituted a separate and substantial crime?\r\n\r\nThe debate being over, the House divided; when it appeared that there\r\nwere for Mr. Wilberforce's motion seventy-four, but against it\r\neighty-two.\r\n\r\nThe motion for the general abolition of the Slave Trade having been thus\r\nlost again in the Commons, a new motion was made there soon after, by\r\nMr. Henry Thornton, on the same subject. The prosecution of this\r\ntraffic, on certain parts of the coast of Africa, had become so\r\ninjurious to the new settlement at Sierra Leone, that not only its\r\ncommercial prospects were but its safety endangered. Mr. Thornton,\r\ntherefore brought in a bill to confine the Slave Trade within certain\r\nlimits. But even this bill, though it had for its object only to free a\r\nportion of the coast from the ravages of this traffic, was opposed by\r\nMr. Gascoyne, Dent, and others. Petitions also were presented against\r\nit. At length, after two divisions, on the first of which there were\r\nthirty-two votes to twenty-seven, and on the second thirty-eight to\r\ntwenty-two, it passed through all its stages.\r\n\r\nWhen it was introduced into the Lords the petitions were renewed against\r\nit. Delay also was interposed to its progress by the examination of\r\nwitnesses. It was not till the fifth of July that the matter was brought\r\nto issue. The opponents of the bill, at that time, were the Duke of\r\nClarence, Lord Westmoreland, Lord Thurlow, and the Lords Douglas and\r\nHay, the two latter being Earls of Morton and Kinnoul, in Scotland. The\r\nsupporters of it were Lord Grenville, who introduced it, Lord\r\nLoughborough, Lord Holland, and Dr. Horsley, Bishop of Rochester: the\r\nlatter was peculiarly eloquent. He began his speech, by arraigning the\r\ninjustice and impolicy of the trade:--\"injustice,\" he said, \"which no\r\nconsiderations of policy could extenuate; impolicy, equal in degree to\r\nits injustice.\"\r\n\r\nHe well knew that the advocates for the Slave Trade had endeavoured to\r\nrepresent the project for abolition, as a branch of jacobinism; but they\r\nwho supported it proceeded upon no visionary motives of equality, or of\r\nthe imprescriptible rights of man. They strenuously upheld the\r\ngradations of civil society: but they did, indeed, affirm that these\r\ngradations were, both ways, both as they ascended and as they descended,\r\nlimited. There was an existence of power, to which no good king would\r\naspire; and there was an extreme condition of subjection, to which man\r\ncould not be degraded without injustice; and this they would maintain,\r\nwas the condition of the African, who was torn away into slavery.\r\n\r\nHe then explained the limits of that portion of Africa, which the bill\r\nintended to set apart as sacred to peace and liberty. He showed that\r\nthis was but one-third of the coast; and, therefore, that two-thirds\r\nwere yet left for the diabolical speculations of the slave merchants. He\r\nexpressed his surprise that such witnesses, as those against the bill,\r\nshould have been introduced at all: he affirmed that their oaths were\r\nfalsified by their own log-books; and that, from their own accounts, the\r\nvery healthiest of their vessels were little better than pestilential\r\ngaols. Mr. Robert Hume, one of these witnesses, had made a certain\r\nvoyage: he had made it in thirty-three days: he had shipped two hundred\r\nand sixty-five slaves, and he had lost twenty-three of them. If he had\r\ngone on losing his slaves, all of whom were under twenty-five years of\r\nage, at this rate, it was obvious, that he would have lost two hundred\r\nand fifty-three of them, if his passage had lasted for a year. Now, in\r\nLondon only, seventeen would have died of that age, out of one thousand\r\nwithin the latter period.\r\n\r\nAfter having exposed the other voyages of Mr. Hume in a similar manner,\r\nhe entered into a commendation of the views of the Sierra Leone company,\r\nand then defended the character of the Africans in their own country, as\r\nexhibited in the Travels of Mr. Mungo Park. He made a judicious\r\ndiscrimination with respect to slavery, as it existed among them: he\r\nshowed that this slavery was analogous to that of the heroic and\r\npatriarchal ages, and contrasted it with the West Indian in an able\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nHe adverted, lastly, to what had fallen from the learned counsel, who\r\nhad supported the petitions of the slave-merchants. One of them had put\r\nthis question to their Lordships, \"If the Slave Trade were as wicked as\r\nit had been represented, why was there no prohibition of it in the Holy\r\nScriptures?\" He then entered into a full defence of the Scriptures on\r\nthis ground, which he concluded by declaring, that, as St. Paul had\r\ncoupled men-stealers with murderers, he had condemned the Slave Trade in\r\none of its most productive modes, and generally in all its modes. And\r\nhere it is worthy of remark, that the word used by the apostle on this\r\noccasion, and which has been translated men-stealers, should have been\r\nrendered slave traders. This was obvious from the scholiast of\r\nAristophanes, whom he quoted. It was clear, therefore, that the Slave\r\nTrade, if murder was forbidden, had been literally forbidden also.\r\n\r\nThe learned counsel, too, had admonished their lordships, to beware how\r\nthey adopted the visionary projects of fanatics. He did not know in what\r\ndirection this shaft was shot; and he cared not. It did not concern him.\r\nWith the highest reverence for the religion of the land, with the\r\nfirmest conviction of its truth, and with the deepest sense of the\r\nimportance Of its doctrines, he was proudly conscious, that the general\r\nshape and fashion of his life bore nothing of the stamp of fanaticism.\r\nBut he begged leave, in his turn, to address a word of serious\r\nexhortation to their lordships. He exhorted them to beware how they were\r\npersuaded to bury, under the opprobrious name of fanaticism, the regard\r\nwhich they owed to the great duties of mercy and justice, for the\r\nneglect of which (if they should neglect them) they would be answerable\r\nat that tribunal, where no prevarication of witnesses could misinform\r\nthe judge; and where no subtlety of an advocate, miscalling the names of\r\nthings, putting evil for good and good for evil, could mislead his\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nAt length the debate ended: when the bill was lost by a majority of\r\nsixty-eight to sixty-one, including personal votes and proxies.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this chapter without offering a few remarks. And,\r\nfirst, I may observe, as the substance of the debates has not been given\r\nfor the period which it contains, that Mr. Wilberforce, upon whom too\r\nmuch praise cannot be bestowed for his perseverance from year to year,\r\namidst the disheartening circumstances which attended his efforts,\r\nbrought every new argument to which either the discovery of new light,\r\nor the events of the times, produced. I may observe also, in justice to\r\nthe memories of Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox, that there was no debate within\r\nthis period, in which they did not take a part; and in which they did\r\nnot irradiate others from the profusion of their own light; and thirdly,\r\nthat in consequence of the efforts of the three, conjoined with those of\r\nothers, the great cause of the abolition was secretly gaining ground.\r\nMany members who were not connected with the trade, but who had yet\r\nhitherto supported it, were on the point of conversion. Though the\r\nquestion had oscillated backwards and forwards, so that an ordinary\r\nspectator could have discovered no gleam of hope at these times, nothing\r\nis more certain, than that the powerful eloquence then displayed had\r\nsmoothed the resistance to it, had shortened its vibrations, and had\r\nprepared it for a state of rest.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the West-Indians themselves, some of them began to see\r\nthrough the mists of prejudice, which had covered them. In the year\r\n1794, when the bill for the abolition of the foreign Slave Trade was\r\nintroduced, Mr. Vaughan and Mr. Barham supported it. They called upon\r\nthe planters in the House to give way to humanity, where their own\r\ninterests could not be affected by their submission. This, indeed, may\r\nbe said to have been no mighty thing; but it was a frank confession of\r\nthe injustice of the Slave Trade, and the beginning of the change which\r\nfollowed, both with respect to themselves and others.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the old friends of the cause, it is with regret I\r\nmention, that it lost the support of Mr. Windham within this period; and\r\nthis regret is increased by the consideration, that he went off on the\r\navowed plea of expediency against moral rectitude; a doctrine, which, at\r\nleast upon this subject, he had reprobated for ten years. It was,\r\nhowever, some consolation, as far as talents were concerned, (for there\r\ncan be none for the loss of virtuous feeling,) that Mr. Canning, a new\r\nmember, should have so ably supplied his place.\r\n\r\nOf the gradual abolitionists, whom we have always considered as the most\r\ndangerous enemies of the cause, Mr. Jenkinson (afterwards Earl of\r\nLiverpool), Mr. Addington (subsequently Lord Sidmouth), and Mr. Dundas\r\n(afterwards Lord Melville), continued their opposition during all this\r\ntime. Of the first two I shall say nothing at present; but I cannot pass\r\nover the conduct of the latter. He was the first person, as we have\r\nseen, to propose the gradual abolition of the Slave Trade; and he fixed\r\na time for its cessation on the 1st of January, 1800. His sincerity on\r\nthis occasion was doubted by Mr. Fox at the very outset; for he\r\nimmediately rose and said, that \"something so mischievous had come out,\r\nsomething so like a foundation had been laid for preserving, not only\r\nfor years to come, but for anything he knew, for ever, this detestable\r\ntraffic, that he felt it his duty immediately to deprecate all such\r\ndelusions upon the country.\" Mr. Pitt, who spoke soon afterwards, in\r\nreply to an argument advanced by Mr. Dundas, maintained, that \"at\r\nwhatever period the House should say that the Slave Trade should\r\nactually cease, this defence would equally be set up; for it would be\r\njust as good an argument in seventy years hence, as it was against the\r\nabolition then.\" And these remarks Mr. Dundas verified in a singular\r\nmanner within this period: for in the year 1796, when his own bill, as\r\namended in the Commons, was to take place, he was one of the most\r\nstrenuous opposers of it; and in the year 1799, when in point of\r\nconsistency it devolved upon him to propose it to the House, in order\r\nthat the trade might cease on the 1st of January, 1800, (which was the\r\ntime of his own original choice, or a time unfettered by parliamentary\r\namendment,) he was the chief instrument of throwing out Mr.\r\nWilberforce's bill, which promised even a longer period to its\r\ncontinuance: so that it is obvious, that there was no time, within his\r\nown limits, when the abolition would have suited him, notwithstanding\r\nhis profession, \"that he had always been a warm advocate for the\r\nmeasure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nContinuation from July 1799 to July 1805.--Various motions within this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question had now been brought forward in almost every possible way,\r\nand yet had been eventually lost. The total and immediate abolition had\r\nbeen attempted; and then the gradual. The gradual again had been tried\r\nfor the year 1798, then for 1795, and then for 1796, at which period it\r\nwas decreed, but never allowed to be executed. An Abolition of a part of\r\nthe trade, as it related to the supply of foreigners with slaves, was\r\nthe next measure proposed; and when this failed, the abolition of\r\nanother part of it, as it related to the making of a certain portion of\r\nthe coast of Africa sacred to liberty, was attempted; but this failed\r\nalso. Mr. Wilberforce therefore thought it prudent, not to press the\r\nabolition as a mere annual measure, but to allow members time to digest\r\nthe eloquence, which had been bestowed upon it for the last five years,\r\nand to wait till some new circumstances should favour its introduction.\r\nAccordingly he allowed the years 1800, 1801, 1802, and 1803, to pass\r\nover without any further parliamentary notice than the moving for\r\ncertain papers; during which he took an opportunity of assuring the\r\nHouse, that he had not grown cool in the cause, but that he would\r\nagitate it in a future session.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1804, which was fixed upon for renewed exertion, the\r\ncommittee for the abolition of the Slave Trade elected James Stephen,\r\nZachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham, Esqrs., and William Phillips, into\r\ntheir own body. Four other members, also, Robert Grant, and John\r\nThornton, Esqrs., and William Manser and William Allen, were afterwards\r\nadded to the list. Among, the reasons for fixing upon this year, one may\r\nbe assigned, namely, that the Irish members, in consequence of the union\r\nwhich had taken place between the two countries, had then all taken\r\ntheir seats in the House of Commons; and that most of them were friendly\r\nto the cause.\r\n\r\nThis being the situation of things, Mr. Wilberforce, on the 30th of\r\nMarch, asked leave to renew his bill for the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade within a limited time, Mr. Fuller opposed the motion. A debate\r\nensued. Colonel Tarleton, Mr. Devaynes, Mr. Addington, and Mr. Manning\r\nspoke against it, however, notwithstanding his connection with the West\r\nIndies, said he would support it, if an indemnification were offered to\r\nthe planters, in case any actual loss should accompany the measure.\r\n\r\nSir William Geary questioned the propriety of immediate abolition.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Buxton, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, and Mr. Barbara spoke in favour of\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\nMr. William Smith rose, when the latter had seated himself, and\r\ncomplimented him on this change of sentiment, so honourable to him,\r\ninasmuch as he had espoused the cause of humanity against his supposed\r\ninterest as a planter. Mr. Leigh said that he would not tolerate such a\r\ntraffic for a moment. All the feelings of nature revolted at it. Lord de\r\nBlaquiere observed, \"it was the first time the question had been\r\nproposed to Irishmen as legislators. He believed it would be supported\r\nby most of them. As to the people of Ireland, he could pledge himself\r\nthat they were hostile to this barbarous traffic.\" An amendment having\r\nbeen proposed by Mr. Manning, a division took place upon it, when leave\r\nwas given to bring in the bill, by a majority of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-four to forty-nine.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June, when the second reading of the bill was moved, it\r\nwas opposed by Sir W. Yonge, Dr. Laurence, Mr. C. Brook, Mr. Dent, and\r\nothers. Among these Lord Castlereagh professed himself a friend to the\r\nabolition of the trade, but he differed as to the mode. Sir J.\r\nWrottesley approved of the principle of the bill, but would oppose it in\r\nsome of its details. Mr. Windham allowed the justice, but differed as to\r\nthe expediency, of the measure. Mr. Deverell professed himself to have\r\nbeen a friend to it; but he had then changed his mind. Sir Laurence\r\nParsons wished to see a plan for the gradual extinction of the trade.\r\nLord Temple affirmed that the bill would seal the death-warrant of every\r\nWhite inhabitant of the islands. The second reading was supported by Sir\r\nRalph Milbank, Messrs. Pitt, Fox, William Smith, Whitbread, Francis,\r\nBarham, and Grenfell, and Sir John Newport. Mr. Grenfell observed, that\r\nhe could not give a silent vote, when the character of the country was\r\nconcerned. When the question of the abolition first came before the\r\npublic, he was a warm friend to it; and from that day to this he had\r\ncherished the same feelings. He assured Mr. Wilberforce of his constant\r\nsupport. Sir John Newport stated that the Irish nation took a virtuous\r\ninterest in this noble cause. He ridiculed the idea that the trade and\r\nmanufactures of the country would suffer by the measure in\r\ncontemplation; but, even if they should suffer, he would oppose it.\r\n\"Fiat justitia, ruat coelura,\" Upon a division, there appeared for the\r\nsecond reading one hundred, and against it forty-two.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of June, when a motion was made to go into a committee upon\r\nthe bill, it was opposed by Messrs. Fuller, C. Brook, C. Ellis, Dent,\r\nDeverell, and Manning: and it was supported by Sir Robert Buxton, Mr.\r\nBarham, and the Hon. J.S. Cocks. The latter condemned the imprudence of\r\nthe planters. Instead of profiting by the discussions, which had taken\r\nplace, and making wise provisions against the great event of the\r\nabolition, which would sooner or later take place, they had only thought\r\nof new stratagems to defeat it. He declared his abhorrence of the trade,\r\nwhich he considered to be a national disgrace. The House divided: when\r\nthere were seventy-nine for the motion, and against it, twenty.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of June the bill was opposed in its last stage by Sir W.\r\nYoung, Messrs. Dickenson, Mr. Rose, Addington, and Dent.; and supported\r\nby: Messrs. Pitt, W. Smith, Francis, and Barham; when it was carried by\r\na majority of sixty-nine to thirty-six. It was then taken up to the\r\nLords; but on a motion of Lord Hawkesbury, then a member of that House,\r\nthe discussion of it was postponed to the next year.\r\n\r\nThe session being ended, the committee for the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade, increased its number, by the election of the Right Honourable\r\nLord Teignmouth, Dr. Dickson, and Wilson Birkbeek, as members.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1805, Mr. Wilberforce renewed his motion of the former year.\r\nColonel Tarleton, Sir William Yonge, Mr. Puller, and Mr. Gascoyne\r\nopposed it. Leave, however, was given him to introduce his bill.\r\n\r\nOn the second reading of it, a serious opposition took place; and an\r\namendment was moved for postponing it till that day six months. The\r\namendment was opposed by Mr. Fox and Mr. Huddlestone. The latter could\r\nnot help lifting his voice against this monstrous traffic in the sinews\r\nand blood of man, the toleration of which had so long been the disgrace\r\nof the British legislature. He did not charge the enormous guilt\r\nresulting from it upon the nation at large; for the nation had washed\r\nits hands of it by the numerous petitions it had sent against it; and it\r\nhad since been a matter of astonishment to all Christendom, how the\r\nconstitutional guardians of British freedom should have sanctioned\r\nelsewhere the greatest system of cruelty and oppression in the world.\r\n\r\nHe said that a curse attended this trade even in the mode of defending\r\nit. By a certain fatality, none but the vilest arguments were brought\r\nforward, which corrupted the very persons who used them. Every one of\r\nthese was built on the narrow ground of interest--of pecuniary\r\nprofit--of sordid gain--in opposition to every high consideration--to\r\nevery motive that had reference to humanity, justice, and religion--or\r\nto that great principle which comprehended them all. Place only before\r\nthe most determined advocate of this odious traffic the exact image of\r\nhimself in the garb and harness of a slave, dragged and whipped about\r\nlike a beast; place this image also before him, and paint it as that of\r\none without a ray of hope to cheer him; and you would extort from him\r\nthe reluctant confession, that he would not endure for an hour the\r\nmisery to which he condemned his fellow-man for life. How dared he,\r\nthen, to use this selfish plea of interest against the voice of the\r\ngenerous sympathies of his nature? But even upon this narrow ground, the\r\nadvocates for the traffic had been defeated. If the unhallowed argument\r\nof expediency was worth anything when opposed to moral rectitude, or if\r\nit were to supercede precepts of Christianity, where was a man to stop,\r\non what was he to draw? For anything he knew, it might be physically\r\ntrue, that human blood was the best manure for the land; but who ought\r\nto shed it on that account? True expediency, however, was, where it ever\r\nwould be found, on the side of that system which was most merciful and\r\njust. He asked how it happened, that sugar could be imported cheaper\r\nfrom the East Indies than from the West, notwithstanding the vast\r\ndifference of the length of the voyages, but on account of the impolicy\r\nof slavery; or that it was made in the former case by the industry of\r\nfree men, and in the latter by the languid drudgery of slaves.\r\n\r\nAs he had had occasion to advert to the Eastern part of the world, he\r\nwould make an observation upon an argument, which had been collected\r\nfrom that quarter. The condition of the Negroes in the West Indies had\r\nbeen lately compared with that of the Hindoos. But he would observe that\r\nthe Hindoo, miserable as his hovel was, had sources of pride and\r\nhappiness, to which not only the West Indian slave, but even his master,\r\nwas a stranger. He was to be sure a peasant; and his industry was\r\nsubservient to the gratifications of an European lord; but he was, in\r\nhis own belief, vastly superior to him. He viewed him as one of the\r\nlowest cast. He would not on any consideration eat from the same plate.\r\nHe would not suffer his son to marry the daughter of his master, even if\r\nshe could bring him all the West Indies as her portion. He would\r\nobserve, too, that the Hindoo peasant drank his water from his native\r\nwell; that, if his meal were scanty, he received it from the hand of\r\nher, who was most dear to him; that, when he laboured, he laboured for\r\nher and his offspring. His daily task being finished, he reposed with\r\nhis family. No retrospect of the happiness of former days, compared with\r\nexisting misery, disturbed his slumber, nor horrid dreams occasioned him\r\nto wake in agony at the dawn of day. No barbarous sounds of cracking\r\nwhips reminded him, that with the form and image of a man his destiny\r\nwas that of the beast of the field. Let the advocates for the bloody\r\ntraffic state what they had to set off on their side of the question\r\nagainst the comforts and independence of the man, with whom they\r\ncompared the slave.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was supported by Sir William Yonge, Sir William Pulteney,\r\nColonel Tarleton, Messrs. Gascoyne, C. Brook, and Hiley Addington. On\r\ndividing the House upon it, there appeared for it seventy-seven, but\r\nagainst it only seventy.\r\n\r\nThis loss of the question, after it had been carried in the last year by\r\nso great a majority, being quite unexpected, was a matter of severe\r\ndisappointment; and might have discouraged the friends of the cause in\r\nthis infancy of their renewed efforts, if they had not discovered the\r\nreason of its failure. After due consideration it appeared, that no\r\nfewer than nine members, who had never been absent once in sixteen years\r\nwhen it was agitated, gave way to engagements on the day of the motion,\r\nfrom a belief that it was safe. It appeared also, that out of the great\r\nnumber of Irish members, who supported it in the former year, only nine\r\nwere in the House, when it was lost. It appeared also that, previously\r\nto this event, a canvass, more importunate than had heard of on any\r\nformer occasion, had been made among the latter by those interested in\r\nthe continuance of the trade. Many of these, unacquainted with the\r\ndetail of the subject, like the English members, admitted the dismal\r\nrepresentations, which were then made to them. The desire, of doing good\r\non the one hand, and the fear of doing injury on the other, perplexed\r\nthem; and in this dubious state they absented themselves at the time\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the failure having been found accidental, and capable of a\r\nremedy, it was resolved that an attempt should be made immediately in\r\nthe House in a new form. Lord Henry Petty signified his intention of\r\nbringing in a bill for the abolition of the foreign part of the Slave\r\nTrade; but the impeachment of Lord Melville, and other weighty matters\r\ncoming on, the notice was not acted upon in that session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n--Continuation from July 1805 to July 1806--Author returns to his duty\r\nin the committee--Travels again round the kingdom--Death of Mr.\r\nPitt--His character, as it related to the question--Motion for the\r\nabolition of the foreign Slave-Trade--Resolution to take measures for\r\nthe total abolition of it--Address to the King to negotiate with\r\nforeign powers for their concurrence in it--Motion to prevent any new\r\nvessel going into the trade--these carried through both Houses of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now almost certain, to the inexpressible joy of the committee,\r\nthat the cause, with proper vigilance, could be carried in the next\r\nsession in the House of Commons. It became them therefore to prepare to\r\nsupport it. In adverting to measures for this purpose, it occurred to\r\nthem, that the House of Lords, if the question should be then carried to\r\nthem from the Commons, might insist upon hearing evidence on the general\r\nsubject. But, alas, even the body of witnesses, which had been last\r\ncollected, was broken by death or dispersion! It was therefore to be\r\nformed again. In this situation it devolved upon me, as I had now\r\nreturned to the committee after an absence of nine years, to take\r\nanother journey for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThis journey I performed with extraordinary success. In the course of it\r\nI had also much satisfaction on another account. I found the old friends\r\nof the cause still faithful to it. It was remarkable, however, that the\r\nyouth of the rising generation knew but little about the question. For\r\nthe last eight or nine years the committee had not circulated any books;\r\nand the debates in the Commons during that time had not furnished them\r\nwith the means of an adequate knowledge concerning it. When, however, I\r\nconversed with these, as I travelled along, I discovered a profound\r\nattention to what I said; an earnest desire to know more of the subject;\r\nand a generous warmth in favour of the injured Africans, which I foresaw\r\ncould soon be turned into enthusiasm. Hence I perceived that the cause\r\nfurnished us with endless sources of rallying: and that the ardour which\r\nwe had seen with so much admiration in former years, could be easily\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely finished my journey, when Mr. Pitt died. This event took\r\nplace in January 1806, I shall stop therefore to make a few observations\r\nupon his character, as it related to this cause. This I feel myself\r\nbound in justice to do, because his sincerity towards it has been\r\ngenerally questioned.\r\n\r\nThe way, in which Mr. Pitt became acquainted with this question, has\r\nalready been explained. A few doubts having been removed, when it was\r\nfirst started, he professed himself a friend to the abolition. The first\r\nproof, which he gave of his friendship to it is known but to few; but it\r\nis, nevertheless, true, that so early as in 1788, he occasioned a\r\ncommunication to be made to the French government, in which he\r\nrecommended an union of the two countries for the promotion of the great\r\nmeasure. This proposition seemed to be then new and strange to the Court\r\nof France; and the answer was not favourable.\r\n\r\nFrom this time his efforts were reduced within the boundaries of his own\r\npower. As far, however, as he had scope, he exerted them. If we look at\r\nhim in his parliamentary capacity, it must be acknowledged by all, that\r\nhe took an active, strenuous, and consistent part, and this year after\r\nyear, by which he realized his professions. In my own private\r\ncommunications with him, which were frequent, he never failed to give\r\nproofs of a similar disposition. I had always free access to him. I had\r\nno previous note or letter to write for admission. Whatever papers I\r\nwanted, he ordered. He exhibited also in his conversation with me on\r\nthese occasions marks of a more than ordinary interest in the welfare of\r\nthe cause. Among the subjects, which were then started, there was one,\r\nwhich was always near his heart. This was the civilization of Africa. He\r\nlooked upon this great work as a debt due to that continent for the many\r\ninjuries we had inflicted upon it: and had the abolition succeeded\r\nsooner, as in the infancy of his exertions he had hoped, I know he had a\r\nplan, suited no doubt to the capaciousness of his own mind, for such\r\nestablishments in Africa, as he conceived would promote in due time this\r\nimportant end.\r\n\r\nI believe it will be said, notwithstanding what I have advanced, that if\r\nMr. Pitt had exerted himself as the Minister of this country in behalf\r\nof the abolition, he could have carried it. This brings the matter to an\r\nissue; for unquestionably the charge of insincerity, as it related to\r\nthis great question, arose from the mistaken notion, that, as his\r\nmeasures in Parliament were supported by great majorities, he could do\r\nas he pleased there. But they who hold this opinion, must be informed,\r\nthat there were great difficulties, against which he had to struggle on\r\nthis subject! The Lord Chancellor Thurlow ran counter to his wishes\r\nalmost at the very outset. Lord Liverpool, and Mr. Dundas, did the same.\r\nThus, to go no further, three of the most powerful members of the\r\ncabinet were in direct opposition to him. The abolition then, amidst\r\nthis difference of opinion, could never become a cabinet measure; but if\r\nso, then all his parliamentary efforts in this case wanted their usual\r\nauthority, and he could only exert his influence as a private man[A].\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: This he did with great effect on one or two occasions. On\r\nthe motion of Mr. Cawthorne in 1791, the cause hung as it were by a\r\nthread; and would have failed that day, to my knowledge, but for his\r\nseasonable exertions.]\r\n\r\nBut a difficulty, still more insuperable, presented itself, in an\r\noccurrence which took place in the year 1791, but which is much too\r\ndelicate to be mentioned. The explanation of it, however, would convince\r\nthe reader, that all the efforts of Mr. Pitt from that day were rendered\r\nuseless, I mean, as to bringing the question, as a Minister of State, to\r\na favourable issue.\r\n\r\nBut though Mr. Pitt did not carry this great question, he was yet one of\r\nthe greatest supporters of it; He fostered it in its infancy. If, in his\r\npublic situation, he had then set his face against it, where would have\r\nbeen our hope? He upheld it also in its childhood; and though in this\r\nstate of its existence it did not gain from his protection all the\r\nstrength Which it was expected it would have acquired, he yet kept it\r\nfrom falling, till his successors, in whose administration a greater\r\nnumber Of favourable circumstances concurred to give it vigour, brought\r\nit to triumphant maturity.\r\n\r\nLord Grenville and Mr. Fox, having been called to the head of the\r\nexecutive government on the death of Mr. Pitt, the cause was ushered\r\ninto Parliament under new auspices. In a former year His Majesty had\r\nissued a proclamation by which British merchants were forbidden (with\r\ncertain defined exceptions) to import slaves into the colonies, which\r\nhad been conquered by the British arms in the course of the war. This\r\ncircumstance afforded an opportunity of trying the question in the House\r\nof Commons with the greatest hope of success. Accordingly Sir A. Pigott,\r\nthe Attorney-General, as an officer of the crown, brought in a bill on\r\nthe thirty-first of March 1806, the first object of which was, to give\r\neffect to the proclamation now mentioned. The second was, to prohibit\r\nBritish subjects from being engaged in importing slaves into the\r\ncolonies of any foreign power whether hostile or neutral. And the third\r\nwas, to prohibit British subjects and British capital from being\r\nemployed in carrying on the Slave Trade in foreign ships; and also to\r\nprevent the outfit of foreign ships from British ports.\r\n\r\nSir A. Pigott, on the introduction of this bill, made an appropriate\r\nspeech. The bill was supported by Mr. Fox, Sir William Yonge, Mr. Brook,\r\nand Mr. Bagwell; but opposed by Generals Tarleton and Gascoyne, Mr.\r\nRose, Sir Robert Peel, and Sir Charles Price. On the third reading, a\r\ndivision being called for, there appeared for it thirty-five, and\r\nagainst it only thirteen.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of May it was introduced into the Lords. The supporters of it\r\nthere were, the Duke of Gloucester, Lord Grenville, the Bishops of\r\nLondon and St. Asaph, the Earl of Buckinghamshire and the Lords Holland,\r\nLauderdale, Auckland, Sidmouth, and Ellenborough. The opposers were, the\r\nDukes of Clarence and Sussex, the Marquis of Sligo, the Earl of\r\nWestmoreland, and the Lords Eldon and Sheffield. At length a division\r\ntook place, when there appeared to be in favour of it thirty-three, and\r\nagainst it eighteen.\r\n\r\nDuring the discussions, to which this bill gave birth, Lord Grenville\r\nand Mr. Fox declared in substance, in their respective Houses of\r\nParliament, that they felt the question of the Slave Trade to be one,\r\nwhich involved the dearest interests of humanity, and the most urgent\r\nclaims of policy, justice, and religion; and that, should they succeed\r\nin affecting its abolition, they would regard that success as entailing\r\nmore true glory on their administration, and more honour and advantage\r\non their country, than any other measure, in which they could he\r\nengaged. The bill having passed, (the first, which dismembered this\r\ncruel trade,) it was thought proper to follow it up in a prudent manner;\r\nand, as there was not then time in the advanced period of the session to\r\nbring in another for the total extinction of it, to move a resolution,\r\nby which both Houses should record those principles, on which the\r\npropriety of the latter measure was founded. It was judged also\r\nexpedient that Mr. Fox, as the Prime Minister in the House of Commons,\r\nshould introduce it there.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of June Mr. Fox rose. He began by saying that the motion,\r\nwith which he should conclude, would tend in its consequences to effect\r\nthe total abolition of the Slave Trade; and he confessed that, since he\r\nhad sat in that House (a period of between thirty and forty years), if\r\nhe had done nothing else, but had only been instrumental in carrying\r\nthrough this measure, he should think his life well spent; and should\r\nretire quite satisfied, that he had not lived in vain.\r\n\r\nIn adverting to the principle of the trade, he noticed some strong\r\nexpressions of Mr. Burke concerning it. \"To deal in human flesh and\r\nblood,\" said that great man, \"or to deal, not in the labour of men, but\r\nin men themselves, was to devour the root, instead of enjoying the fruit\r\nof human diligence.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fox then took a view of the opinions of different members of the\r\nHouse on this great question; and showed that, though many had opposed\r\nthe abolition, all but two or three, among whom were the members for\r\nLiverpool, had confessed, that the trade ought to be done away. He then\r\nwent over the different resolutions of the House on the subject, and\r\nconcluded from thence, that they were bound to support his motion.\r\n\r\nHe combated the argument, that the abolition would ruin the West Indian\r\nislands. In doing this he paid a handsome compliment to the memory of\r\nMr. Pitt, whose speech upon this particular point was, he said, the most\r\npowerful and convincing of any he had ever heard. Indeed they, who had\r\nnot; heard it, could have no notion of it. It was a speech, of which he\r\nwould say with the Roman author, reciting the words of the Athenian\r\norator, \"Quid esset, si ipsum audivissetis!\" It was a speech no less\r\nremarkable for splendid eloquence, than for solid sense and convincing\r\nreason; supported by calculations founded on facts, and conclusions\r\ndrawn from premises, as correctly as if they had been mathematical\r\npropositions; all tending to prove that, instead of the West Indian\r\nplantations suffering an injury, they would derive a material benefit by\r\nthe abolition of the Slave Trade. He then called upon the friends of\r\nthis great man to show their respect for his memory by their votes; and\r\nhe concluded with moving, \"that this House, considering the African\r\nSlave Trade to be contrary to the principles of justice, humanity, and\r\npolicy, will, with all practicable expedition, take effectual measures\r\nfor the abolition of the said trade, in such a manner, and at such a\r\nperiod, as may be deemed advisable.\"\r\n\r\nSir Ralph Milbank rose, and seconded the motion.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tarleton rose next. He deprecated the abolition, on account of\r\nthe effect which it would have on the trade and revenue of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Francis said the merchants of Liverpool were at liberty to ask for\r\ncompensation; but he, for one, would never grant it for the loss of a\r\ntrade, which had been declared to be contrary to humanity and justice.\r\nAs an uniform friend to this great cause, he wished Mr. Fox had not\r\nintroduced a resolution, but a real bill for the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade. He believed that both Houses were then disposed to do it away. He\r\nwished the golden opportunity might not be lost.\r\n\r\nLord Castlereagh thought it a proposition, on which no one could\r\nentertain a doubt, that the Slave Trade was a great evil in itself; and\r\nthat it was the duty and policy of Parliament to extirpate it; but he\r\ndid not think the means offered were adequate to the end proposed. The\r\nabolition, as a political question, was a difficult one. The year 1796\r\nhad been once fixed upon by the House, as the period when the trade was\r\nto cease; but, when the time arrived, the resolution was not executed.\r\nThis was a proof, either that the House did not wish for the event, or\r\nthat they judged it impracticable. It would be impossible, he said, to\r\nget other nations to concur in the measure; and even if they were to\r\nconcur, it could not be effected. We might restrain the subjects of the\r\nparent-state from following the trade; but we could not those in our\r\ncolonies. A hundred frauds would be committed by these, which we could\r\nnot detect. He did not mean by this, that the evil was to go on for\r\never. Had a wise plan been proposed at first, it might have been\r\nhalf-cured by this time. The present resolution would do no good. It was\r\nvague, indefinite, and unintelligible. Such resolutions were only the\r\nslave-merchants' harvests. They would go for more slaves than usual in\r\nthe interim. He should have advised a system of duties on fresh\r\nimportations of slaves, progressively increasing to a certain extent;\r\nand that the amount of these duties should be given to the planters, as\r\na bounty to encourage the Negro population upon their estates. Nothing\r\ncould be done, unless we went hand in hand with the latter. But he\r\nshould deliver himself more fully on this subject, when any thing\r\nspecific should be brought forward in the shape of a bill.\r\n\r\nSir S. Romilly, the Solicitor-General, differed from Lord Castlereagh;\r\nfor he thought the resolution of Mr. Fox was very simple and\r\nintelligible. If there was a proposition vague and indefinite, it was\r\nthat advanced by the noble lord, of a system of duties on fresh\r\nimportations, rising progressively, and this under the patronage and\r\nco-operation of the planters. Who could measure the space between the\r\npresent time and the abolition of the trade, if that measure were to\r\ndepend upon the approbation of the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe cruelty and injustice of the Slave Trade had been established by\r\nevidence beyond a doubt. It had been shown to be carried on by rapine,\r\nrobbery, and murder; by fomenting and encouraging wars; by false\r\naccusations; and imaginary crimes. The unhappy victims were torn away\r\nnot only in the time of war, but of profound peace. They were then\r\ncarried across the Atlantic, in a manner too horrible to describe; and\r\nafterwards subjected to eternal slavery. In support of the continuance\r\nof such a traffic, he knew of nothing but assertions already disproved,\r\nand arguments already refuted. Since the year 1796, when it was to cease\r\nby a resolution of Parliament, no less than three hundred and sixty\r\nthousand Africans had been torn away from their native land. What an\r\naccumulation was this to our former guilt!\r\n\r\nGeneral Gascoyne made two extraordinary assertions: First, that the\r\ntrade was defensible on Scriptural ground.--\"Both thy bondmen and thy\r\nbondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen, that are\r\nround about thee; of them shall you have bondmen and bondmaids. And thou\r\nshalt take them as an heritance for thy children after thee to inherit\r\nthem for a possession; they shall be thy bondmen for ever.\" Secondly,\r\nthat the trade had been so advantageous to this country, that it would\r\nhave been advisable even to institute a new one, if the old had not\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilberforce replied to General Gascoyne. He then took a view of the\r\nspeech of Lord Castlereagh, which he answered point by point. In the\r\ncourse of his observations he showed that the system of duties\r\nprogressively increasing, as proposed by the noble lord, would be one of\r\nthe most effectual modes of perpetuating the Slave Trade. He exposed,\r\nalso, the false foundation of the hope of any reliance on the\r\nco-operation of the colonists. The House, he said, had, on the motion of\r\nMr. Ellis, in the year 1797, prayed his Majesty to consult with the\r\ncolonial legislatures to take such measures, as might conduce to the\r\ngradual abolition of the African Slave Trade. This address was\r\ntransmitted to them by Lord Melville. It was received in some of the\r\nislands with a declaration, \"that they possibly might, in some\r\ninstances, endeavour to improve the condition of their slaves; but they\r\nshould do this, not with any view to the abolition of the Slave Trade;\r\nfor they considered that trade as their birth-right, which could not be\r\ntaken from them; and that we should deceive ourselves by supposing, that\r\nthey would agree to such a measure.\"\r\n\r\nHe desired to add to this the declaration of General Prevost in his\r\npublic letter from Dominica. Did he not say, when asked what steps had\r\nbeen taken there in consequence of the resolution of the House in 1797,\r\n\"that the act of the legislature, entitled an act for the encouragement,\r\nprotection, and better government of slaves, appeared to him to have\r\nbeen considered, from the day it was passed until this hour, as a\r\npolitical measure to avert the interference of the mother country in the\r\nmanagement of the slaves.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Yonge censured the harsh language of Sir Samuel Romilly, who\r\nhad applied the terms rapine, robbery, and murder to those, who were\r\nconnected with the Slave Trade. He considered the resolution of Mr. Fox\r\nas a prelude to a bill for the abolition of that traffic, and this bill\r\nas a prelude to emancipation, which would not only be dangerous in\r\nitself, but would change the state of property in the islands.\r\n\r\nLord Henry Petty, after having commented on the speeches of Sir Samuel\r\nRomilly and Lord Castlereagh, proceeded to state his own opinion on the\r\ntrade; which was, that it was contrary to justice, humanity, and sound\r\npolicy, all of which he considered to be inseparable. On its\r\ncommencement in Africa the wickedness began. It produced there fraud and\r\nviolence, robbery and murder. It gave birth to false accusations, and a\r\nmockery of justice. It was the parent of every crime, which could at\r\nonce degrade and afflict the human race. After spreading vice and misery\r\nall over this continent, it doomed its unhappy victims to hardships and\r\ncruelties which were worse than death. The first of these was\r\nconspicuous in their transportation. It was found there, that cruelty\r\nbegat cruelty; that the system, wicked in its beginning, was equally so\r\nin its progress; and that it perpetuated its miseries wherever it was\r\ncarried on. Nor was it baneful only to the objects, but to the promoters\r\nof it. The loss of British seamen in this traffic was enormous.\r\nOne-fifth of all, who were employed in it, perished; that is, they\r\nbecame the victims of a system, which was founded on fraud, robbery, and\r\nmurder; and which procured to the British nation nothing but the\r\nexecration of mankind. Nor had we yet done with the evils which attended\r\nit; for it brought in its train the worst of all moral effects, not only\r\nas it respected the poor slaves, when transported to the colonies, but\r\nas it respected those who had concerns with them there. The arbitrary\r\npower, which it conferred, afforded men of bad dispositions full scope\r\nfor the exercise of their passions; and it rendered men,\r\nconstitutionally of good dispositions, callous to the misery of others.\r\nThus it depraved the nature of all who were connected with it. These\r\nconsiderations had made him a friend to the abolition, from the time he\r\nwas capable of reasoning upon it. They were considerations, also, which\r\ndetermined the House, in the year 1782, to adopt a measure of the same\r\nkind as the present. Had anything happened to change the opinion of\r\nmembers, since? On the contrary, they had now the clearest evidence,\r\nthat all the arguments then used against the abolition were fallacious;\r\nbeing founded, not upon truth, but on assertions devoid of all truth,\r\nand derived from ignorance or prejudice.\r\n\r\nHaving made these remarks, he proved, by a number of facts, the folly of\r\nthe argument, that the Africans laboured under such a total degradation\r\nof mental and moral faculties, that they were made for slavery.\r\n\r\nHe then entered into the great subject of population. He showed that in\r\nall countries, where there were no unnatural hardships, mankind would\r\nsupport themselves. He applied this reasoning to the Negro population in\r\nthe West Indies; which he maintained could not only be kept up, but\r\nincreased, without any further importations from Africa.\r\n\r\nHe then noticed the observations of Sir William Yonge, on the words of\r\nSir Samuel Romilly; and desired him to reserve his indignation for\r\nthose, who were guilty of acts of rapine, robbery, and murder, instead\r\nof venting it on those, who only did their duty in describing them.\r\nNever were accounts more shocking than those lately sent to government\r\nfrom the West Indies. Lord Seaforth, and the Attorney-General, could not\r\nrefrain, in explaining them, from the use of the words murder and\r\ntorture. And did it become members of that House (in order to\r\naccommodate the nerves of the friends of the Slave Trade) to soften down\r\ntheir expressions, when they were speaking on that subject; and to\r\ndesist from calling that murder and torture, for which a Governor, and\r\nthe Attorney-General, of one of the islands could find no better name?\r\n\r\nAfter making observations relative to the co-operation of foreign powers\r\nin this great work, he hoped that the House would not suffer itself to\r\nbe drawn, either by opposition or by ridicule, to the right or to the\r\nleft; but that it would advance straight forward to the accomplishment\r\nof the most magnanimous act of justice, that was ever achieved by any\r\nlegislature in the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Rose declared, that on the very first promulgation of this question,\r\nhe had proposed to the friends of it the very plan of his noble friend\r\nLord Castlereagh; namely, a system of progressive duties, and of\r\nbounties for the promotion of the Negro population. This he said to show\r\nthat he was friendly to the principle of the measure. He would now\r\nobserve, that he did not wholly like the present resolution. It was too\r\nindefinite. He wished, also, that something had been said on the subject\r\nof compensation. He was fearful, also, lest the abolition should lead to\r\nthe dangerous change of emancipation. The Negroes, he said, could not be\r\nin a better state, or more faithful to their masters, than they were. In\r\nthree attacks made by the enemy on Dominica, where he had a large\r\nproperty, arms had been put into their hands; and every one of them had\r\nexerted himself faithfully. With respect to the cruel acts in Barbados,\r\nan account of which had been sent to government by Lord Seaforth and the\r\nAttorney-General of Barbados, he had read them; and never had he read\r\nanything on this subject with more horror. He would agree to the\r\nstrongest measures for the prevention of such acts in future. He would\r\neven give up the colony, which should refuse to make the wilful murder\r\nof a slave felony. But as to the other, or common, evils complained of,\r\nhe thought the remedy should be gradual; and such also as the planters\r\nwould concur in. He, would nevertheless not oppose the present\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nMr. Barham considered compensation but reasonable, where losses were to\r\naccrue from the measure, when it should be put in execution; but he\r\nbelieved that the amount of it would be much less than was apprehended.\r\nHe considered emancipation, though so many fears had been expressed\r\nabout it, as forming no objection to the abolition, though he had\r\nestates in the West Indies himself. Such a measure, if it could be\r\naccomplished successfully, would be an honour to the country, and a\r\nblessing to the planters; but preparation must be made for it by\r\nrendering the slaves fit for freedom, and by creating in them an\r\ninclination to free labour. Such a change could only be the work of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSir John Newport said that the expressions of Sir S. Romilly, which had\r\ngiven such offence, had been used by others; and would be used with\r\npropriety, while the trade lasted. Some slave-dealers of Liverpool had\r\nlately attempted to prejudice certain merchants of Ireland in their\r\nfavour. But none of their representations answered; and it was\r\nremarkable, that the reply made to them was in these words. \"We will\r\nhave no share in a traffic, consisting in rapine, blood, and murder.\" He\r\nthen took a survey of a system of duties progressively increasing, and\r\nshowed that it would be utterly inefficient; and that there was no real\r\nremedy for the different evils complained of, but in the immediate\r\nprohibition of the trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Canning renewed his professions of friendship to the cause. He did\r\nnot like the present resolution; yet he would vote for it. He should\r\nhave been better pleased with a bill, which would strike at once at the\r\nroot of this detestable commerce.\r\n\r\nMr. Manning wished the question to be deferred to the next session. He\r\nhoped compensation would then be brought forward as connected with it.\r\nNothing, however, effectual could be done without the concurrence of the\r\nplanters.\r\n\r\nMr. William Smith noticed, in a striking manner, the different\r\ninconsistencies in the arguments of those, who contended for the\r\ncontinuance of the trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Windham deprecated not only the Slave Trade, but slavery also. They\r\nwere essentially connected with each other. They were both evils, and\r\nought both of them to be done away. Indeed, if emancipation would follow\r\nthe abolition, he should like the latter measure the better. Rapine,\r\nrobbery, and murder, were the true characteristics of this traffic. The\r\nsame epithets had not indeed been applied to slavery, because this was a\r\ncondition, in which some part of the human race had been at every period\r\nof the history of the world. It was, however, a state, which ought not\r\nto be allowed to exist. But, notwithstanding all these confessions, he\r\nshould weigh well the consequences of the abolition before he gave it\r\nhis support. It would be, on a balance between the evils themselves and\r\nthe consequences of removing them, that he should decide for himself on\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox took a view of all the arguments, which had been advanced by the\r\nopponents of the abolition; and having given an appropriate answer to\r\neach, the House divided, when there appeared for the resolution one\r\nhundred and fourteen, and against it but fifteen.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this division, Mr. Wilberforce moved an address to His\r\nMajesty, \"praying that he would be graciously pleased to direct a\r\nnegotiation to be entered into, by which foreign powers should be\r\ninvited to co-operate with His Majesty in measures to be adopted for the\r\nabolition of the African Slave Trade.\"\r\n\r\nThis address was carried without a division. It was also moved and\r\ncarried, that \"these resolutions be communicated to the Lords; and that\r\ntheir concurrence should be desired therein.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June, the Lords met to consider of the resolution and\r\naddress. The Earl of Westmoreland proposed that both counsel and\r\nevidence should be heard against them; but his proposition was\r\noverruled.\r\n\r\nLord Grenville then read the resolution of the Commons. This resolution,\r\nhe said, stated first, that the Slave Trade was contrary to humanity,\r\njustice, and sound policy. That it was contrary to humanity was obvious;\r\nfor humanity might be said to be sympathy for the distress of others, or\r\na desire to accomplish benevolent ends by good means. But did not the\r\nSlave Trade convey ideas the very reverse of this definition? It\r\ndeprived men of all those comforts, in which it pleased the Creator to\r\nmake the happiness of his creatures to consist,--of the blessings of\r\nsociety,--of the charities of the dear relationships of husband, wife,\r\nfather, son, and kindred,--of the due discharge of the relative duties\r\nof these--and of that freedom, which in its pure and natural sense was\r\none of the greatest gifts of God to man.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to read the evidence, as it related to this trade,\r\nwithout acknowledging the inhumanity of it, and our own disgrace. By\r\nwhat means was it kept up in Africa? By wars instigated, not by the\r\npassions of the natives, but by our avarice. He knew it would be said in\r\nreply to this, that the slaves, who were purchased by us, would be put\r\nto death, if we were not to buy them. But what should we say, if it\r\nshould turn out, that we were the causes of those very cruelties, which\r\nwe affected to prevent? But, if it were not so, ought the first nation\r\nin the world to condescend to be the executioner of savages?\r\n\r\nAnother way of keeping up the Slave Trade was by the practice of\r\nman-stealing. The evidence was particularly clear upon this head. This\r\npractice included violence, and often bloodshed. The inhumanity of it\r\ntherefore could not be doubted.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy victims, being thus procured, were conveyed, he said, across\r\nthe Atlantic in a manner which justified the charge of inhumanity again.\r\nIndeed the suffering here was so great, that neither the mind could\r\nconceive, nor the tongue describe, it. He had said on a former occasion,\r\nthat in their transportation there was a greater portion of misery\r\ncondensed within a smaller space, than had ever existed in the known\r\nworld. He would repeat his words; for he did not know, how he could\r\nexpress himself better on the subject. And, after all these horrors,\r\nwhat was their destiny? It was such, as justified the charge in the\r\nresolution again: for, after having survived the sickness arising from\r\nthe passage, they were doomed to interminable slavery.\r\n\r\nWe had been, he said, so much accustomed to words, descriptive of the\r\ncruelty of this traffic, that we had almost forgotten their meaning. He\r\nwished that some person, educated as an Englishman, with suitable powers\r\nof eloquence, but now for the first time informed of all the horrors of\r\nit, were to address their lordships upon it, and he was sure, that they\r\nwould instantly determine that it should cease. But the continuance of\r\nit had rendered cruelty familiar to us; and the recital of its horrors,\r\nhad been so frequent, that we could now hear them stated without being\r\naffected as we ought to be. He intreated their lordships, however, to\r\nendeavour to conceive the hard case of the unhappy victims of it; and as\r\nhe had led them to the last stage of their miserable existence, which\r\nwas in the colonies, to contemplate it there. They were there under the\r\narbitrary will of a cruel task-master from morning till night. When they\r\nwent to rest, would not their dreams be frightful? When they awoke,\r\nwould they not awake--\r\n\r\n\r\n  --only to discover sights of woe,\r\n  Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace\r\n  And rest can never dwell, hope never comes\r\n  That comes to all; but torture without end\r\n  Still urges?--\r\n\r\n\r\nThey knew no change, except in the humour of their masters, to whom\r\ntheir whole destiny was entrusted. We might, perhaps, flatter ourselves\r\nwith saying, that they were subject to the will of Englishmen. But\r\nEnglishmen were not better than others, when in possession of arbitrary\r\npower. The very fairest exercise of it was a never-failing corrupter of\r\nthe heart. But suppose it were allowed that self-interest might operate\r\nsome little against cruelty; yet where was the interest of the overseer\r\nor the driver? But he knew it would be said, that the evils complained\r\nof in the colonies had been mitigated. There might be instances of this;\r\nbut they could never be cured, while slavery existed. Slavery took away\r\nmore than half of the human character. Hence the practice, where it\r\nexisted, of rejecting the testimony of the slave: but, if this testimony\r\nwas rejected, where could be his redress against his oppressor?\r\n\r\nHaving shown the inhumanity, he would proceed to the second point in the\r\nresolution, or the injustice of the trade. We had two ideas of justice,\r\nfirst, as it belonged to society by virtue of a social compact; and,\r\nsecondly, as it belonged to men, not as citizens of a community, but as\r\nbeings of one common nature. In a state of nature, man had a right to\r\nthe fruit of his own labour absolutely to himself; and one of the main\r\npurposes, for which he entered into society, was that he might be better\r\nprotected in the possession of his rights. In both cases therefore it\r\nwas manifestly unjust, that a man should be made to labour during the\r\nwhole of his life, and yet have no benefit from his labour. Hence the\r\nSlave Trade and the colonial slavery were a violation of the very\r\nprinciple, upon which all law for the protection of property was\r\nfounded. Whatever benefit was derived from that trade, to an individual,\r\nit was derived from dishonour and dishonesty. He forced from the unhappy\r\nvictim of it that, which the latter did not wish to give him; and he\r\ngave to the same victim that, which he in vain attempted to show was an\r\nequivalent to the thing he took,--it being a thing for which there was\r\nno equivalent; and which, if he had not obtained by force, he would not\r\nhave possessed at all. Nor could there be any answer to this reasoning,\r\nunless it could be proved, that it had pleased God to give to the\r\ninhabitants of Britain a property in the liberty and life of the natives\r\nof Africa. But he would go further on this subject. The injustice\r\ncomplained of was not confined to the bare circumstance of robbing them\r\nof the right to their own labour. It was conspicuous throughout the\r\nsystem. They, who bought them, became guilty of all the crimes which had\r\nbeen committed in procuring them, and when they possessed them, of all\r\nthe crimes which belonged to their inhuman treatment. The injustice in\r\nthe latter case amounted frequently to murder. For what was it but\r\nmurder to pursue a practice, which produced untimely death to thousands\r\nof innocent and helpless beings? It was a duty, which their lordships\r\nowed to their Creator, if they hoped for mercy, to do away this\r\nmonstrous oppression.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the impolicy of the trade, (the third point in the\r\nresolution,) he would say at once, that whatever was inhuman and unjust\r\nmust be, impolitic. He had, however, no objection to argue the point\r\nupon its own particular merits: and, first, he would observe, that a\r\ngreat man, Mr. Pitt, now no more, had exerted his vast powers on many\r\nsubjects, to the admiration of his hearers; but on none more\r\nsuccessfully than on the subject of the abolition of the Slave Trade. He\r\nproved, after making an allowance for the price paid for the slaves in\r\nthe West Indies, for the loss of them in the seasoning, and for the\r\nexpense of maintaining them afterwards; and comparing these particulars\r\nwith the amount in value of their labour there, that the evils endured\r\nby the victims of the traffic were no gain to the master, in whose\r\nservice they took place. Indeed, Mr. Long had laid it down in his\r\n_History of Jamaica_, that the best way to secure the planters from ruin\r\nwould be to do that which the resolution recommended. It was notorious,\r\nthat when any planter was in distress, and sought to relieve himself by\r\nincreasing the labour on his estate, by means of the purchase of new\r\nslaves, the measure invariably tended to his destruction. What then was\r\nthe importation of fresh Africans, but a system tending to the general\r\nruin of the islands?\r\n\r\nBut it had often been said, that without fresh importations the\r\npopulation of the slaves could not be supported in the islands. This,\r\nhowever, was a mistake. It had arisen from reckoning the deaths of the\r\nimported Africans, of whom so many were lost in the seasoning, among the\r\ndeaths of the Creole slaves. He did not mean to say that, under the\r\nexisting degree of misery, the population would greatly increase; but,\r\nhe would maintain, that if the deaths and the births were calculated\r\nupon those, who were either born, or who had been a long time in the\r\nislands, so as to be considered as natives, it would be found that the\r\npopulation had not only been kept up, but that it had been increased.\r\n\r\nIf it was true, that the labour of a free-man was cheaper than that of a\r\nslave; and, also, that the labour of a long-imported slave was cheaper\r\nthan that of a fresh-imported one; and, again, that the chances of\r\nmortality were much more numerous among the newly-imported slaves in the\r\nWest Indies, than among those of old standing there, (propositions,\r\nwhich he took to be established,) we should see new arguments for the\r\nimpolicy of the trade.\r\n\r\nIt might be stated also, that the importation of vast bodies of men, who\r\nhad been robbed of their rights, and grievously irritated on that\r\naccount, into our colonies, (where their miserable condition opened new\r\nsources of anger and revenge,) was the importation only of the seeds of\r\ninsurrection into them. And here he could not but view with astonishment\r\nthe reasoning of the West Indian planters, who held up the example of\r\nSt. Domingo as a warning against the abolition of the Slave Trade;\r\nbecause the continuance of it was one of the great causes of the\r\ninsurrections and subsequent miseries in that devoted island. Let us but\r\nencourage importations in the same rapid progression of increase every\r\nyear, which took place in St. Domingo, and we should witness the same\r\neffect in our own islands.\r\n\r\nTo expose the impolicy of the trade further, he would observe, that it\r\nwas an allowed axiom, that as the condition of man was improved, he\r\nbecame more useful. The history of our own country, in very early times,\r\nexhibited instances of internal slavery, and this to a considerable\r\nextent. But we should find that; precisely in proportion as that slavery\r\nwas ameliorated, the power and prosperity of the country flourished.\r\nThis was exactly applicable to the case in question. There could be no\r\ngeneral amelioration of slavery in the West Indies, while the Slave\r\nTrade lasted: but if we were to abolish it, we should make it the\r\ninterest of every owner of slaves to do that, which would improve their\r\ncondition, and which, indeed, would lead ultimately to the annihilation\r\nof slavery itself. This great event, however, could not be accomplished\r\nat once; it could only be effected in a course of time.\r\n\r\nIt would be endless, he said, to go into all the cases, which would\r\nmanifest the impolicy of this odious traffic. Inhuman as it was, unjust\r\nas it was, he believed it to be equally impolitic; and if their\r\nLordships should be of this opinion also, he hoped they would agree to\r\nthat part of the resolution, in which these truths were expressed. With\r\nrespect to the other part of it, or that they would proceed to abolish\r\nthe trade, he observed, that neither the time, nor the manner of doing\r\nit, were specified. Hence, if any of them should differ as to these\r\nparticulars, they, might yet vote for the resolution, as they were not\r\npledged to anything definite in these respects, provided they thought\r\nthat the trade should be abolished at some time or other: and he did not\r\nbelieve that there was any one of them, who would sanction its\r\ncontinuance for ever.\r\n\r\nLord Hawkesbury said, that he did not mean to discuss the question, on\r\nthe ground of justice and humanity, as contradistinguished from sound\r\npolicy. If it could fairly be made out that the African Slave Trade was\r\ncontrary to justice and humanity, it ought to be abolished. It did not,\r\nhowever, follow, because a great evil subsisted, that therefore it\r\nshould be removed; for it might be comparatively a less evil, than that\r\nwhich would accompany the attempt to remove it. The noble lord, who had\r\njust spoken, had exemplified this; for though slavery was a great evil\r\nin itself, he was of opinion that it could not be done away, but in a\r\ncourse of time.\r\n\r\nA state of slavery, he said, had existed in Africa from the earliest\r\ntime; and, unless other nations would concur with England in the measure\r\nof the abolition, we could not change it for the better.\r\n\r\nSlavery had existed also throughout all Europe. It had now happily, in a\r\ngreat measure, been done away. But how? Not by acts of parliament, for\r\nthese might have retarded the event, but by the progress of\r\ncivilization, which removed the evil in a gradual and rational manner.\r\n\r\nHe then went over the same ground of argument, as when a member of the\r\nCommons in 1792. He said that the inhumanity of the abolition was\r\nvisible in this, that not one slave less would be taken from Africa; and\r\nthat such as were taken from it, would suffer more than they did now, in\r\nthe hands of foreigners. He maintained also, as before, that the example\r\nof St. Domingo afforded one of the strongest arguments against the\r\nabolition of the trade. And he concluded by objecting to the resolution,\r\ninasmuch as it could do no good, for the substance of it would be to be\r\ndiscussed again in a future session.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of London, Dr. Porteus, began, by noticing the concession of\r\nthe last speaker, namely, that if the trade was contrary to humanity and\r\njustice, it ought to be abolished. He expected, he said, that the noble\r\nlord would have proved that it was not contrary to these great\r\nprinciples, before he had supported its continuance; but not a word had\r\nhe said to show that the basis of the resolution in these respects was\r\nfalse. It followed then, he thought, that as the noble lord had not\r\ndisproved the premises; he was bound to abide by the conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe ways, he said, in which the Africans were reduced to slavery in\r\ntheir own country, were by wars,--many of which were excited for the\r\npurpose,--by the breaking up of villages, by kidnapping and by\r\nconviction for a violation of their own laws. Of the latter class many\r\nwere accused falsely, and of crimes which did not exist. He then read a\r\nnumber of extracts from the evidence examined before the privy council,\r\nand from the histories of those, who, having lived in Africa, had thrown\r\nlight upon this subject before the question was agitated. All these, he\r\nsaid, (and similar instances could be multiplied,) proved the truth of\r\nthe resolution, that the African Slave Trade was contrary to the\r\nprinciples of humanity, justice, and sound policy.\r\n\r\nIt was moreover, he said, contrary to the principles of the religion we\r\nprofessed. It was not superfluous to say this, when it had been so\r\nfrequently asserted that it was sanctioned both by the Jewish and the\r\nChristian dispensations. With respect to the Jews he would observe, that\r\nthere was no such thing as perpetual slavery among them. Their slaves\r\nwere of two kinds, those of their own nation, and those from the country\r\nround about them. The former were to be set free on the seventh year;\r\nand the rest, of whatever nation, on the fiftieth, or on the year of\r\nJubilee. With respect to the Christian dispensation, it was a libel to\r\nsay that it countenanced such a traffic. It opposed it both in its\r\nspirit and in its principle; nay, it opposed it positively, for it\r\nclassed men-stealers, or slave traders, among the murderers of fathers\r\nand mothers, and the most profane criminals upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of slavery in Africa, which the noble lord had glanced at,\r\nafforded, he said, no argument for its continuance. Such a mode of\r\ndefence would prevent for ever the removal of any evil; it would justify\r\nthe practice of the Chinese, who exposed their infants in the streets to\r\nperish; it would also justify piracy, for that practice existed long\r\nbefore we knew anything of the African Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nHe then combatted the argument, that we did a kindness to the Africans\r\nby taking them from their homes; and concluded, by stating to their\r\nlordships, that, if they refused to sanction the resolution, they would\r\nestablish these principles, \"that though individuals might not rob and\r\nmurder, yet that nations might--that though individuals incurred the\r\npenalties of death by such practices, yet that bodies of men might\r\ncommit them with impunity for the purposes of lucre;--and that for such\r\npurposes they were not only to be permitted, but encouraged.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor (Erskine) confessed that he was not satisfied with\r\nhis own conduct on this subject. He acknowledged, with deep contrition,\r\nthat, during the time he was a member of the other House, he had not\r\nonce attended when this great question was discussed.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies he could say, personally, that the slaves were well\r\ntreated, where he had an opportunity of seeing them. But no judgment was\r\nto be formed there with respect to the evils complained of; they must be\r\nappreciated as they existed in the trade. Of these he had also been an\r\neye-witness. It was on this account that he felt contrition for not\r\nhaving attended the House on this subject, for there were some cruelties\r\nin this traffic which the human imagination could not aggravate. He had\r\nwitnessed such scenes over the whole coast of Africa; and he could say,\r\nthat if their lordships could only have a sudden glimpse of them, they\r\nwould be struck with horror, and would be astonished that they could\r\never have been permitted to exist. What then would they say to their\r\ncontinuance year after year, and from age to age?\r\n\r\nFrom information, which he could not dispute, he was warranted in\r\nsaying, that, on this continent, husbands were fraudulently and forcibly\r\nsevered from their wives, and parents from their children; and that all\r\nthe ties of blood and affection were torn up by the roots. He had\r\nhimself seen the unhappy natives put together in heaps in the hold of a\r\nship, where, with every possible attention to them, their situation must\r\nhave been intolerable. He had also heard proved, in courts of justice,\r\nfacts still more dreadful than those which he had seen. One of these he\r\nwould just mention. The slaves on board a certain ship rose in a mass to\r\nliberate themselves, and having advanced far in the pursuit of their\r\nobject, it became necessary to repel them by force. Some of them\r\nyielded, some of them were killed in the scuffle, but many of them\r\nactually jumped into the sea and were drowned, thus preferring death to\r\nthe misery of their situation; while others hung to the ship, repenting\r\nof their rashness, and bewailing with frightful noises their horrid\r\nfate. Thus the whole vessel exhibited but one hideous scene of\r\nwretchedness. They who were subdued and secured in chains were seized\r\nwith the flux, which carried many of them off. These things were proved\r\nin a trial before a British jury, which had to consider whether this was\r\na loss which fell within the policy of insurance, the slaves being\r\nregarded as if they had been only a cargo of dead matter. He could\r\nmention other instances, but they were much too shocking to be\r\ndescribed. Surely their lordships could never consider such a traffic to\r\nbe consistent with humanity or justice. It was impossible.\r\n\r\nThat the trade had long subsisted there was no doubt, but this was no\r\nargument for its continuance. Many evils of much longer standing had\r\nbeen done away, and it was always our duty to attempt to remove them.\r\nShould we not exult in the consideration, that we, the inhabitants of a\r\nsmall island, at the extremity of the globe, almost at its north pole,\r\nwere become the morningstar to enlighten the nations of the earth, and\r\nto conduct them out of the shades of darkness into the realms of light;\r\nthus exhibiting to an astonished and an admiring world the blessings of\r\na free constitution? Let us then not allow such a glorious opportunity\r\nto escape us.\r\n\r\nIt had been urged that we should suffer by the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade; he believed that we should not suffer. He believed that our duty\r\nand our interest were inseparable; and he had no difficulty in saying,\r\nin the face of the world, that his own opinion was, that the interests\r\nof a nation would be best preserved by its adherence to the principles\r\nof humanity, justice, and religion.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Westmoreland said, that the African Slave Trade might be\r\ncontrary to humanity and justice, and yet it might be politic; at least,\r\nit might be inconsistent with humanity, and yet not be inconsistent with\r\njustice; this was the case when we executed a criminal, or engaged in\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not contrary to justice, for justice, in this case,\r\nmust be measured by the law of nations. But the purchase of slaves was\r\nnot contrary to this law. The Slave Trade was a trade with the consent\r\nof the inhabitants of two nations, and procured by no terror, nor by any\r\nact of violence whatever. Slavery had existed from the first ages of the\r\nworld, not only in Africa, but throughout the habitable globe, among the\r\nPersians, Greeks, and Romans; and he would compare, with great advantage\r\nto his argument, the wretched condition of the slaves in these ancient\r\nstates with that of those in our colonies. Slavery too had been allowed\r\nin a nation which was under the especial direction of Providence; the\r\nJews were allowed to hold the heathen in bondage. He admitted that what\r\nthe learned prelate had said relative to the emancipation of the latter\r\nin the year of jubilee was correct; but he denied that his quotation\r\nrelative to the stealers of men referred to the Christian religion. It\r\nwas a mere allusion to that which was done contrary to the law of\r\nnations, which was the only measure of justice between states.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the inhumanity of the trade, he would observe, that if\r\ntheir lordships, sitting there as legislators, were to set their faces\r\nagainst everything which appeared to be inhuman, much of the security on\r\nwhich their lives and property depended might be shaken, if not totally\r\ndestroyed. The question was, not whether there was not some evil\r\nattending the Slave Trade, but whether by the measure now before them\r\nthey should increase or diminish the quantity of human misery in the\r\nworld. He believed, for one, considering the internal state of Africa,\r\nand the impossibility of procuring the concurrence of foreign nations in\r\nthe measure, that they would not be able to do any good by the adoption\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nAs to the impolicy of the trade, the policy of it, on the other hand,\r\nwas so great, that he trembled at the consequences of its abolition. The\r\nproperty connected with this question amounted to a hundred millions.\r\nThe annual produce of the islands was eighteen millions, and it yielded\r\na revenue of four millions annually. How was this immense property and\r\nincome to be preserved? Some had said it would be preserved, because the\r\nblack population in the islands could be kept up without further\r\nsupplies; but the planters denied this assertion, and they were the best\r\njudges of the subject.\r\n\r\nHe condemned the resolution as a libel upon the wisdom of the law of the\r\nland; and upon the conduct of their ancestors. He condemned it also,\r\nbecause, if followed up, it would lead to the abolition of the trade,\r\nand the abolition of the trade to the emancipation of the slaves in our\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of St. Asaph (Dr. Horsley) said, that, allowing the slaves in\r\nthe West Indies even to be pampered with delicacies, or to be put to\r\nrest on a bed of roses, they could not be happy, for--a slave would be\r\nstill a slave. The question, however, was not concerning the alteration\r\nof their condition, but whether we should abolish the practice, by which\r\nthey were put in that condition? Whether it was humane, just, and\r\npolitic in us so to place them? This question was easily answered; for\r\nhe found it difficult to form any one notion of humanity, which did not\r\ninclude a desire of promoting the happiness of others; and he knew of no\r\nother justice than that, which was founded on the principle of doing to\r\nothers, as we should wish they should do to us. And these principles of\r\nhumanity and justice were so clear, that he found it difficult to make\r\nthem clearer. Perhaps no difficulty was greater than that of arguing a\r\nself-evident proposition, and such he took to be the character of the\r\nproposition, that the Slave Trade was inhuman and unjust.\r\n\r\nIt had been said, that slavery had existed from the beginning of the\r\nworld. He would allow it. But had such a trade as the Slave Trade ever\r\nexisted before? Would the noble Earl, who had talked of the slavery of\r\nancient Rome and Greece, assert, that in the course of his whole\r\nreading, however profound it might have been, he had found anything\r\nresembling such a traffic? Where did it appear in history, that ships\r\nwere regularly fitted out to fetch away tens of thousands of persons\r\nannually, against their will, from their native land; that these were\r\nsubject to personal indignities and arbitrary punishments during their\r\ntransportation; and that a certain proportion of them, owing to\r\nsuffocation and other cruel causes, uniformly perished? He averred, that\r\nnothing like the African Slave Trade was ever practised in any nation\r\nupon earth.\r\n\r\nIf the trade then was repugnant, as he maintained it was, to justice and\r\nhumanity, he did not see how, without aiding and abetting injustice and\r\ninhumanity, any man could sanction it: and he thought that the noble\r\nbaron (Hawkesbury) was peculiarly bound to support the resolution; for\r\nhe had admitted that if it could be shown, that the trade was contrary\r\nto these principles, the question would be at an end. Now this\r\ncontrariety had been made apparent, and his lordship had not even\r\nattempted to refute it.\r\n\r\nHe would say but little on the subject of revealed religion, as it\r\nrelated to this question, because the reverend prelate, near him, had\r\nspoken so fully upon it. He might observe, however, that at the end of\r\nthe sixth year, when the Hebrew slave was emancipated, he was to be\r\nfurnished liberally from the flock, the floor, and the wine-press of his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nLord Holland lamented the unfaithfulness of the noble baron (Hawkesbury)\r\nto his own principles, and the inflexible opposition of the noble earl\r\n(Westmoreland), from both which circumstances he despaired for ever of\r\nany assistance from them to this glorious cause. The latter wished to\r\nhear evidence on the subject, for the purpose, doubtless, of delay. He\r\nwas sure, that the noble earl did not care what the evidence would say\r\non either side; for his mind was made up, that the trade ought not to be\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nThe noble earl had made a difference between humanity, justice, and\r\nsound policy. God forbid, that we should ever admit such distinctions in\r\nthis country! But he had gone further, and said, that a thing might be\r\ninhuman, and yet not unjust; and he put the case of the execution of a\r\ncriminal in support of it. Did he not by this position confound all\r\nnotions of right and wrong in human institutions? When a criminal was\r\njustly executed, was not the execution justice to him who suffered, and\r\nhumanity to the body of the people at large?\r\n\r\nThe noble earl had said also, that we should do no good by the\r\nabolition, because other nations would not concur in it. He did not know\r\nwhat other nations would do; but this he knew, that we ourselves ought\r\nnot to be unjust because they should refuse to be honest. It was,\r\nhowever, self-obvious, that, if we admitted no more slaves into our\r\ncolonies, the evil would be considerably diminished.\r\n\r\nAnother of his arguments did not appear to be more solid; for surely the\r\nSlave Trade ought not to be continued, merely because the effect of the\r\nabolition might ultimately be that of the emancipation of the slaves; an\r\nevent, which would be highly desirable in its due time.\r\n\r\nThe noble lord had also said, that the planters were against the\r\nabolition, and that without their consent it could never be\r\naccomplished. He differed from him in both these points: for, first, he\r\nwas a considerable planter himself, and yet he was a friend to the\r\nmeasure: secondly, by cutting off all further supplies, the planters\r\nwould be obliged to pay more attention to the treatment of their slaves,\r\nand this treatment would render the trade unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe noble earl had asserted also, that the population in the West Indies\r\ncould not be kept up without further importations; and this was the\r\nopinion of the planters, who were the best judges of the subject. As a\r\nplanter he differed from his lordship again. If, indeed, all the waste\r\nlands were to be brought into cultivation, the present population would\r\nbe insufficient. But the government had already determined, that the\r\ntrade should not be continued for such a purpose. We were no longer to\r\ncontinue pirates, or executioners for every petty tyrant in Africa, in\r\norder that every holder of a bit of land in our islands might cultivate\r\nthe whole of his allotment; a work, which might require centuries.\r\nMaking this exception, he would maintain, that no further importations\r\nwere necessary. Few or no slaves had been imported into Antigua for many\r\nyears; and he believed, that even some had been exported from it. As to\r\nJamaica, although in one year fifteen thousand died in consequence of\r\nhurricane and famine, the excess of deaths over the births during the\r\ntwenty years preceding 1788 was only one per cent. Deducting, however,\r\nthe mortality of the newly imported slaves, and making the calculation\r\nupon the Negroes born in the island or upon those who had been long\r\nthere, he believed the births and the deaths would be found equal. He\r\nhad a right therefore to argue that the Negroes, with better treatment\r\n(which the abolition would secure), would not only maintain but increase\r\ntheir population, without any aid from Africa. He would add, that the\r\nnewly imported Africans brought with them not only disorders which\r\nravaged the plantations, but danger from the probability of\r\ninsurrections. He wished most heartily for the total abolition of the\r\ntrade. He was convinced, that it was both inhuman, unjust, and\r\nimpolitic. This had always been his opinion as an individual since he\r\nwas capable of forming one. It was his opinion then as a legislator. It\r\nwas his opinion as a colonial proprietor; and it was his opinion as an\r\nEnglishman, wishing for the prosperity of the British empire.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Suffolk contended, that the population of the slaves in the\r\nislands could be kept up by good treatment, so as to be sufficient for\r\ntheir cultivation. He entered into a detail of calculations from the\r\nyear 1772 downwards in support of this statement. He believed all the\r\nmiseries of St. Domingo arose from the vast importation of Africans. He\r\nhad such a deep sense of the inhumanity and injustice of the Slave\r\nTrade, that, if ever he wished any action of his life to be recorded, it\r\nwould be that of the vote he should then give in support of the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nLord Sidmouth said, that he agreed to the substance of the resolution,\r\nbut yet he could not support it. Could he be convinced that the trade\r\nwould be injurious to the cause of humanity and justice, the question\r\nwith him would be decided; for policy could not be opposed to humanity\r\nand justice. He had been of opinion for the last twenty years, that the\r\ninterests of the country and those of numerous individuals were so\r\ndeeply blended with this traffic, that we should be very cautious how we\r\nproceeded. With respect to the cultivation of new lands, he would not\r\nallow a single Negro to be imported for such a purpose; but he must have\r\na regard to the old plantations. When he found a sufficient increase in\r\nthe Black population to continue the cultivation already established\r\nthere, then, but not till then, he would agree to an abolition of the\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nEarl Stanhope said he would not detain their lordships long. He could\r\nnot, however, help expressing his astonishment at what had fallen from\r\nthe last speaker; for he had evidently confessed that the Slave Trade\r\nwas inhuman and unjust, and then he had insinuated, that it was neither\r\ninhuman nor unjust to continue it. A more paradoxical or whimsical\r\nopinion, he believed, was never entertained, or more whimsically\r\nexpressed in that house. The noble viscount had talked of the interests\r\nof the planters; but this was but a part of the subject; for surely the\r\npeople of Africa were not to be forgotten. He did not understand the\r\npractice of complimenting the planters with the lives of men, women, and\r\nhelpless children by thousands, for the sake of their pecuniary\r\nadvantage; and they, who adopted it, whatever they might think of the\r\nconsistency of their own conduct, offered an insult to the sacred names\r\nof humanity and justice.\r\n\r\nThe noble Earl (Westmoreland) had asked what would be the practical\r\neffect of the abolition of the Slave Trade. He would inform him. It\r\nwould do away the infamous practices which took place in Africa; it\r\nwould put an end to the horrors of the passage; it would save many\r\nthousands of our fellow-creatures from the miseries of eternal slavery;\r\nit would oblige the planters to treat those better, who were already in\r\nthat unnatural state; it would increase the population of our islands;\r\nit would give a death-blow to the diabolical calculations, whether it\r\nwas cheaper to work the Negroes to death and recruit the gangs by fresh\r\nimportations, or to work them moderately and to treat them kindly. He\r\nknew of no event, which would be attended with so many blessings.\r\n\r\nThere was but one other matter, which he would notice. The noble baron\r\n(Hawkesbury) had asserted, that all the horrors of St. Domingo were the\r\nconsequence of the speculative opinions which were current in a\r\nneighbouring kingdom on the subject at liberty. They had, he said, no\r\nsuch origin. They were owing to two causes; first, to the vast number of\r\nNegroes recently imported into that island; and, secondly, to a\r\nscandalous breach of faith by the French legislature. This legislature\r\nheld out the idea not only of the abolition of the Slave Trade, but also\r\nof all slavery; but it broke its word. It held forth the rights of man\r\nto the whole human race, and then, in practice, it most infamously\r\nabandoned every article in these rights; so that it became the scorn of\r\nall the enlightened and virtuous part of mankind. These were the great\r\ncauses of the miseries of St. Domingo, and not the speculative opinions\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nEarl Grosvenor could not but express the joy he felt at the hope, after\r\nall his disappointments, that this wicked trade would be done away. He\r\nhoped that his Majesty's ministers were in earnest, and that they would,\r\nearly in the next session, take this great question up with a\r\ndetermination to go through with it; so that another year should not\r\npass before we extended the justice and humanity of the country to the\r\nhelpless and unhappy inhabitants of Africa.\r\n\r\nEarl Fitzwilliam said he was fearful lest the calamities of St. Domingo\r\nshould be brought home to our own islands. We ought not, he thought, too\r\nhastily to adopt the resolution on that account. He should therefore\r\nsupport the previous question.\r\n\r\nLord Ellenborough said, he was sorry to differ from his noble friend\r\n(Lord Sidmouth), and yet he could not help saying that if after twenty\r\nyears, during which this question had been discussed by both Houses of\r\nParliament, their lordships' judgments were not ripe for its\r\ndetermination, he could not look with any confidence to a time when they\r\nwould be ready to decide it.\r\n\r\nThe question then before them was short and plain. It was, whether the\r\nAfrican Slave Trade was inhuman, unjust, and impolitic. If the premises\r\nwere true, we could not too speedily bring it to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe subject had been frequently brought before him in a way which had\r\nenabled him to become acquainted with it; and he was the more anxious on\r\nthat account to deliver his sentiments upon it as a peer of Parliament,\r\nwithout reference to anything he had been called upon to do in the\r\ndischarge of his professional duty. When he looked at the mode in which\r\nthis traffic commenced, by the spoliation of the rights of a whole\r\nquarter of the globe; by the misery of whole nations of helpless\r\nAfricans; by tearing them from their homes, their families, and their\r\nfriends; when he saw the unhappy victims carried away by force; thrust\r\ninto a dungeon in the hold of a ship, in which the interval of their\r\npassage from their native to a foreign land was filled up with misery,\r\nunder every degree of debasement, and in chains; and when he saw them\r\nafterwards consigned to an eternal slavery, he could not but contemplate\r\nthe whole system with horror. It was inhuman in its beginning, inhuman\r\nin its progress, and inhuman to the very end.\r\n\r\nNor was it more inhuman than it was unjust. The noble earl,\r\n(Westmoreland,) in adverting to this part of the question had considered\r\nit as a question of justice between two nations, but it was a moral\r\nquestion. Although the natives of Africa might be taken by persons\r\nauthorized by their own laws to take and dispose of them, and the\r\npractice, therefore, might be said to be legal as it respected them, yet\r\nno man could doubt, whatever ordinances they might have to sanction it,\r\nthat it was radically, essentially, and in principle, unjust; and\r\ntherefore there could be no excuse for us in continuing it. On the\r\ngeneral principle of natural justice, which was paramount to all\r\nordinances of men, it was quite impossible to defend this traffic; and\r\nhe agreed with the noble baron (Hawkesbury) that, having decided that it\r\nwas inhuman and unjust, we should not inquire whether it was impolitic.\r\nIndeed, the inquiry itself would be impious; for it was the common\r\nordinance of God, that that which was inhuman and unjust, should never\r\nbe for the good of man. Its impolicy, therefore, was included in its\r\ninjustice and its inhumanity. And he had no doubt, when the importations\r\nwere stopped, that the planters would introduce a change of system among\r\ntheir slaves which would increase their population, so as to render any\r\nfurther supplies from Africa unnecessary. It had been proved, indeed,\r\nthat the Negro population in some of the islands was already in this\r\ndesirable state. Many other happy effects would follow. As to the losses\r\nwhich would arise from the abolition of the Slave Trade, they, who were\r\ninterested in the continuance of it, had greatly over-rated them. When\r\npleading formerly in his professional capacity for the merchants of\r\nLiverpool at their lordships' bar, he had often delivered statements,\r\nwhich he had received from them, and which he afterwards discovered to\r\nbe grossly incorrect. He could say from his own knowledge, that the\r\nassertion of the noble earl (Westmoreland), that property to the amount\r\nof a hundred millions would be endangered, was wild and fanciful. He\r\nwould not however deny, that some loss might accompany the abolition;\r\nbut there could be no difficulty in providing for it. Such a\r\nconsideration ought not to be allowed to impede their progress in\r\ngetting rid of an horrible injustice.\r\n\r\nBut it had been said that we should do but little in the cause of\r\nhumanity by abolishing the Slave Trade; because other nations would\r\ncontinue it. He did not believe they would. He knew that America was\r\nabout to give it up. He believed the states of Europe would give it up.\r\nBut, supposing that they were all to continue it, would not our honour\r\nbe the greater? Would not our virtue be the more signal? for then\r\n\r\n\r\n  --Faithful we\r\n  Among the faithless found:\r\n\r\n\r\nto which he would add, that undoubtedly we should diminish the evil, as\r\nfar as the number of miserable beings was concerned, which was\r\naccustomed to be transported to our own colonies.\r\n\r\nEarl Spencer agreed with the noble viscount (Sidmouth), that the\r\namelioration of the condition of the slaves was an object, which might\r\nbe effected in the West Indies; but he was certain, that the most\r\neffectual way of improving it would be by the total and immediate\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade; and for that reason he would support the\r\nresolution. Had the resolution held out emancipation to them, it would\r\nnot have had his assent; for it would have ill become the character of\r\nthis country, if it had been once promised, to have withheld it from\r\nthem. It was to such deception that the horrors of St. Domingo were to\r\nbe attributed. He would not enter into the discussion of the general\r\nsubject at present. He was convinced that the trade was what the\r\nresolution stated it to be, inhuman, unjust, and impolitic. He wished\r\ntherefore, most earnestly indeed, for its abolition. As to the mode of\r\neffecting it, it should be such as would be attended with the least\r\ninconvenience to all parties. At the same time he would not allow small\r\ninconveniences to stand in the way of the great claims of humanity,\r\njustice, and religion.\r\n\r\nThe question was then put on the resolution, and carried by a majority\r\nof forty-one to twenty. The same address also to His Majesty, which had\r\nbeen agreed upon by the Commons, was directly afterwards moved. This\r\nalso was carried, but without the necessity of a division.\r\n\r\nThe resolution and the motion having passed both Houses, one other\r\nparliamentary measure was yet necessary to complete the proceedings of\r\nthis session. It was now almost universally believed, in consequence of\r\nwhat had already taken place there, that the Slave Trade had received\r\nits death-wound; and that it would not long survive it. It was supposed,\r\ntherefore, that the slave-merchants would, in the interim, fit out not\r\nonly all the vessels they had, but even buy others, to make what might\r\nbe called their last harvest. Hence, extraordinary scenes of rapine and\r\nmurder would be occasioned in Africa. To prevent these, a new bill was\r\nnecessary. This was accordingly introduced into the Commons. It enacted,\r\nbut with one exception, that from and after the first of August, 1806,\r\nno vessel should clear out for the Slave Trade, unless it should have\r\nbeen previously employed by the same owner or owners in the said trade,\r\nor should be proved to have been contracted for previously to the 10th\r\nof June, 1806, for the purpose of being employed in that trade. It may\r\nnow be sufficient to say that this bill also passed both Houses of\r\nParliament; soon after which the session ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n--Continuation from July 1806, to March 1807.--Death of Mr. Fox.--Bill\r\nfor the total abolition of the Slave Trade carried in the House of\r\nLords; sent from thence to the Commons; amended and passed there;\r\ncarried back, and passed with its amendments by the Lords; receives\r\nthe royal assent.--Reflections on this great event.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for the committee to look back to the proceedings of\r\nthe last session, as they related to the great question under their\r\ncare, without feeling a profusion of joy, as well as of gratitude to\r\nthose, by whose virtuous endeavours they had taken place. But, alas, how\r\nfew of our earthly pleasures come to us without alloy! a melancholy\r\nevent succeeded. We had the painful intelligence, in the month of\r\nOctober 1806, that one of the oldest and warmest friends of the cause\r\nwas then numbered with the dead.\r\n\r\nOf the character of Mr. Fox, as it related to this cause, I am bound to\r\ntake notice. And, first, I may observe, that he professed an attachment\r\nto it almost as soon as it was ushered into the world. Early in the year\r\n1788, when he was waited upon by a deputation of the committee, his\r\nlanguage was, as has appeared in the first volume, \"that he would\r\nsupport their object to its fullest extent, being convinced that there\r\nwas no remedy for the evil but in the total abolition of the trade.\"\r\n\r\nHis subsequent conduct evinced the sincerity of his promises. He was\r\nconstant in his attendance in Parliament whenever the question was\r\nbrought forward; and he never failed to exert his powerful eloquence in\r\nits favour. The countenance, indeed, which he gave it, was of the\r\ngreatest importance to its welfare; for most of his parliamentary\r\nfriends, who followed his general political sentiments, patronized it\r\nalso. By the aid of these, joined to that of the private friends of Mr.\r\nPitt, and of other members, who espoused it without reference to party,\r\nit was always so upheld, that after the year 1791 no one of the defeats\r\nwhich it sustained, was disgraceful. The majority on the side of those\r\ninterested in the continuance of the trade was always so trifling, that\r\nthe abolitionists were preserved a formidable body, and their cause\r\nrespectable.\r\n\r\nI never heard whether Mr. Fox, when he came into power, made any\r\nstipulations with His Majesty on the subject of the Slave Trade: but\r\nthis I know, that he determined upon the abolition of it, if it were\r\npracticable, as the highest glory of his administration, and as the\r\ngreatest earthly blessing which it was in the power of the Government to\r\nbestow; and that he took considerable pains to convince some of his\r\ncolleagues in the cabinet of the propriety of the measure.\r\n\r\nWhen the resolution, which produced the debates in parliament, as\r\ndetailed in the last chapter, was under contemplation, it was thought\r\nexpedient that Mr. Fox, as the minister of state in the House of\r\nCommons, should introduce it himself. When applied to for this purpose\r\nhe cheerfully undertook the office, thus acting in consistency with his\r\npublic declaration in the year 1791, \"that in whatever situation he\r\nmight ever be, he would use his warmest efforts for the promotion of\r\nthis righteous cause.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the next measure, or the bill to prevent the sailing of any new\r\nvessel in the trade after the 1st of August, was publicly disclosed, it\r\nwas suggested to him, that the session was nearly over; that he might\r\npossibly weary both Houses by another motion on the subject; and that,\r\nif he were to lose it, or to experience a diminution of his majorities\r\nin either, he might injure the cause, which was then in the road to\r\ntriumph. To this objection he replied, \"that he believed both Houses\r\nwere disposed to get rid of the trade; that his own life was precarious;\r\nthat if he omitted to serve the injured Africans on this occasion, he\r\nmight have no other opportunity of doing it; and that he dared not,\r\nunder these circumstances, neglect so great a duty.\"\r\n\r\nThis prediction relative to himself became unfortunately verified; for\r\nhis constitution, after this, began to decline, till at length his\r\nmortal destiny, in the eyes of his medical attendants, was sealed. But\r\neven then, when removed by pain and sickness from the discussion of\r\npolitical subjects, he never forgot this cause. In his own sufferings he\r\nwas not unmindful of those of the injured Africans. \"Two things,\" said\r\nhe, on his death-bed, \"I wish earnestly to see accomplished,--peace with\r\nEurope--and the abolition of the Slave Trade.\" But knowing well, that we\r\ncould much better protect ourselves against our own external enemies,\r\nthan this helpless people against their oppressors, he added, \"but of\r\nthe two I wish the latter.\" These sentiments he occasionally repeated,\r\nso that the subject was frequently in his thoughts in his last illness.\r\nNay, \"the very hope of the abolition (to use the expression of Lord\r\nHowick in the House of Commons) quivered on his lips in the last hour of\r\nit.\" Nor is it improbable, if earthly scenes ever rise to view at that\r\nawful crisis, and are perceptible, that it might have occupied his mind\r\nin the last moment of his existence. Then indeed would joy ineffable,\r\nfrom a conviction of having prepared the way for rescuing millions of\r\nhuman beings from misery, have attended the spirit on its departure from\r\nthe body; and then also would this spirit, most of all purified when in\r\nthe contemplation of peace, good-will, and charity upon earth, be in the\r\nfittest state, on gliding from its earthly cavern, to commix with the\r\nendless ocean of benevolence and love.\r\n\r\nAt length the session of 1807 commenced. It was judged advisable by Lord\r\nGrenville, that the expected motion on this subject should, contrary to\r\nthe practice hitherto adopted, be agitated first in the Lords.\r\nAccordingly, on the 2nd of January he presented a bill, called an act\r\nfor the abolition of the Slave Trade; but he then proposed only to print\r\nit, and to let it lie on the table, that it might be maturely\r\nconsidered, before it should be discussed.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th, no less than four counsel were heard against the bill.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th the debate commenced. But of this I shall give no detailed\r\naccount; nor, indeed, of any of those which followed it. The truth is,\r\nthat the subject has been exhausted. They, who spoke in favour of the\r\nabolition, said very little that was new concerning it. They, who spoke\r\nagainst it, brought forward, as usual, nothing but negative assertions\r\nand fanciful conjectures. To give therefore what was said by both\r\nparties at these times, would be but useless repetition[A]. To give, on\r\nthe other hand, that which was said on one side only would appear\r\npartial. Hence I shall offer to the reader little more than a narrative\r\nof facts upon these occasions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The different debates in both Houses on this occasion would\r\noccupy the half of another volume. This is another circumstance, which\r\nreconciles me to the omission. But that, which reconciles me the most\r\nis, that they will be soon published. In these debates justice has been\r\ndone to every individual concerned in them.]\r\n\r\nLord Grenville opened the debate by a very luminous speech. He was\r\nsupported by the Duke of Gloucester, the Bishop of Durham (Dr.\r\nBarrington), the Earls Moira, Selkirk, and Roslyn, and the Lords\r\nHolland, King, and Hood. The opponents of the bill were the Duke of\r\nClarence, the Earls of Westmoreland and St. Vincent, and the Lords\r\nSidmouth, Eldon, and Hawkesbury.\r\n\r\nThe question being called for at four o'clock in the morning, it\r\nappeared that the personal votes and proxies in favour of Lord\r\nGrenville's motion amounted to one hundred, and those against it to\r\nthirty-six. Thus passed the first bill in England, which decreed, that\r\nthe African Slave Trade should cease. And here I cannot omit paying to\r\nhis Highness the Duke of Gloucester the tribute of respect, which is due\r\nto him, for having opposed the example of his royal relations on this\r\nsubject in behalf of an helpless and oppressed people. The sentiments\r\ntoo, which he delivered on this occasion, ought not to be forgotten.\r\n\"This trade,\" said he, \"is contrary to the principles of the British\r\nconstitution. It is, besides, a cruel and criminal traffic in the blood\r\nof my fellow-creatures. It is a foul stain on the national character. It\r\nis an offence to the Almighty. On every ground therefore on which a\r\ndecision can be made; on the ground of policy, of liberty, of humanity,\r\nof justice, but, above all, on the ground of religion, I shall vote for\r\nits immediate extinction.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of February, the bill was carried to the House of Commons.\r\nOn the 20th counsel were heard against it; after which, by agreement,\r\nthe second reading of it took place. On the 23rd the question being put\r\nfor the commitment of it, Lord Viscount Howick (now Earl Grey) began an\r\neloquent speech. After he had proceeded in it some way, he begged leave\r\nto enter his protest against certain principles of relative justice,\r\nwhich had been laid down. \"The merchants and planters,\" said he, \"have\r\nan undoubted right, in common with other subjects of the realm, to\r\ndemand justice at our hands. But that, which they denominate justice,\r\ndoes not correspond with the legitimate character of that virtue: for\r\nthey call upon us to violate the rights of others, and to transgress our\r\nown moral duties. That, which they distinguish as justice, involves in\r\nitself the greatest injury to others. It is not, in fact, justice, which\r\nthey demand, but--favour--and favour to themselves at the expense of the\r\nmost grievous oppression of their fellow-creatures.\"\r\n\r\nHe then argued the question on the ground of policy. He showed, by a\r\nnumber of official documents, how little this trade had contributed to\r\nthe wealth of the nation, being but a fifty-fourth part of its export\r\ntrade; and he contended that as four-sevenths of it had been cut off by\r\nHis Majesty's proclamation, and the passing of the foreign slave bill in\r\na former year, no detriment of any consequence would arise from the\r\npresent measure.\r\n\r\nHe entered into an account of the loss of seamen, and of the causes of\r\nthe mortality, in this trade.\r\n\r\nHe went largely into the subject of negro-population, in the islands\r\nfrom official documents, giving an account of it up to the latest date.\r\nHe pointed out the former causes of its diminution, and stated how the\r\nremedies for these would follow.\r\n\r\nHe showed how, even if the quantity of colonial produce should be\r\ndiminished for a time, this disadvantage would, in a variety of\r\ninstances, be more than counterbalanced by advantages, which would not\r\nonly be great in themselves, but permanent.\r\n\r\nHe then entered into a refutation of the various objections which had\r\nbeen made to the abolition, in an eloquent and perspicuous manner; and\r\nconcluded by appealing to the great authorities of Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox\r\nin behalf of the proposed measure. \"These precious ornaments,\" he said,\r\n\"of their age and country, had examined the subject with all the force\r\nof their capacious minds. On this question they had dismissed all\r\nanimosity--all difference of opinion--and had proceeded in union; and he\r\nbelieved, that the best tribute of respect we could show, or the most\r\nsplendid monument we could raise, to their memories, would be by the\r\nadoption of the glorious measure of the abolition of the Slave Trade.\"\r\n\r\nLord Howick was supported by Mr. Roscoe, who was then one of the members\r\nfor Liverpool; by Mr. Lushington, Mr. Fawkes, Lord Mahon, Lord Milton,\r\nSir John Doyle, Sir Samuel Romilly, Mr. Wilberforce, and Earl Percy, the\r\nlatter of whom wished that a clause might be put into the bill, by which\r\nall the children of slaves, born after January 1810, should be made\r\nfree. General Gascoyne and Mr. Hibbert opposed the bill. Mr. Manning\r\nhoped that compensation would be made to the planters in case of loss.\r\nMr. Bathurst and Mr. Hiley Addington preferred a plan for gradual\r\nabolition to the present mode. These having spoken, it appeared on a\r\ndivision, that there were for the question two hundred and eighty-three,\r\nand against it only sixteen.\r\n\r\nOf this majority I cannot but remark, that it was probably the largest\r\nthat was ever announced on any occasion, where the House was called upon\r\nto divide. I must observe, also, that there was such an enthusiasm among\r\nthe members at this time, that there appeared to be the same kind and\r\ndegree of feeling, as manifested itself within the same walls in the\r\nyear 1788, when the question was first started. This enthusiasm, too,\r\nwhich was of a moral nature, was so powerful, that it seemed even to\r\nextend to a conversion of the heart; for several of the old opponents of\r\nthis righteous cause went away, unable to vote against it; while others\r\nof them staid in their places, and voted in its favour.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of February, Lord Howick moved, that the House resolve\r\nitself into a committee on the bill for the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade. Sir C. Pole, Messrs. Hughan, Brown, Bathurst, Windham, and Fuller\r\nopposed the motion; and Sir R. Milbank, and Messrs. Wynne, Barham,\r\nCourtenay, Montague, Jacob, Whitbread, and Herbert (of Kerry), supported\r\nit. At length the committee was allowed to sit _pro formâ_, and Mr.\r\nHobhouse was put into the chair. The bill then went through it, and, the\r\nHouse being resumed, the report was received and read.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of March, when the committee sat again, Sir C. Pole moved,\r\nthat the year 1812 be substituted for the year 1807, as the time when\r\nthe trade should be abolished. This amendment produced a long debate,\r\nwhich was carried on by Sir C. Pole, Messrs. Fuller, Hiley Addington,\r\nRose, Gascoyne, and Bathurst, on one side; and by Mr. Ward, Sir P.\r\nFrancis; General Vyse, Sir T. Turton, Mr. Whitbread, Lord Henry Petty,\r\nMessrs. Canning, Stanhope, Perceval, and Wilberforce on the other. At\r\nlength, on a division, there appeared to be one hundred and twenty-five\r\nagainst the amendment, and for it only seventeen. The chairman then read\r\nthe bill, and it was agreed that he should report it with the amendments\r\non Monday. The bill enacted, that no vessel should clear out for slaves\r\nfrom any port within the British dominions after the 1st of May, 1807,\r\nand that no slave should be landed in the colonies after the 1st of\r\nMarch, 1808.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of March, on the motion of Lord Henry Petty, the question\r\nwas put, that the bill be read a third time. Mr. Hibbert, Captain\r\nHerbert, Mr. T.W. Plomer, Mr. Windham, and Lord Castlereagh, spoke\r\nagainst the motion. Sir P. Francis, Mr. Lyttleton, Mr. H. Thornton, and\r\nMessrs. Barham, Sheridan, and Wilberforce supported it. After this the\r\nbill was passed without a division[A].\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: S. Lushington, Esq., M.P. for Yarmouth, gave his voluntary\r\nattendance and assistance to the committee, during all these motions,\r\nand J. Bowdler, Esq., was elected a member of it.]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 18th, Lord Howick, accompanied by Mr. Wilberforce and\r\nothers, carried the bill to the Lords. Lord Grenville, on receiving it,\r\nmoved that it should be printed, and that, if this process could be\r\nfinished by Monday, it should be taken into consideration on that day.\r\nThe reason of this extraordinary haste was, that His Majesty, displeased\r\nwith the introduction of the Roman Catholic officers' bill into the\r\nCommons, had signified his intention to the members of the existing\r\nadministration, that they were to be displaced.\r\n\r\nThis uneasiness, which, a few days before, had sprung up among the\r\nfriends of the abolition, on the report that this event was probable,\r\nbegan now to show itself throughout the kingdom. Letters were written\r\nfrom various parts, manifesting the greatest fear and anxiety on account\r\nof the state of the bill, and desiring answers of consolation. Nor was\r\nthis state of the mind otherwise than what might have been expected upon\r\nsuch an occasion; for the bill was yet to be printed. Being an amended\r\none, it was to be argued again in the Lords. It was then to receive the\r\nroyal assent. All these operations implied time; and it was reported\r\nthat the new ministry[A] was formed; among whom were several who had\r\nshown a hostile disposition to the cause.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The only circumstance, which afforded comfort at this time,\r\nwas, that the Hon. Spencer Perceval and Mr. Canning were included in it,\r\nwho were warm patrons of this great measure.]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 23rd, the House of Lords met. Such extraordinary\r\ndiligence had been used in printing the bill, that it was then ready.\r\nLord Grenville immediately brought it forward. The Earl of Westmoreland\r\nand the Marquis of Sligo opposed it. The Duke of Norfolk and the Bishop\r\nof Llandaff (Dr. Watson) supported it. The latter said, that this great\r\nact of justice would be recorded in heaven. The amendments were\r\nseverally adopted without a division. But here an omission of three\r\nwords was discovered, namely, \"country, territory, or place,\" which, if\r\nnot rectified, might defeat the purposes of the bill. An amendment was\r\nimmediately proposed and carried. Thus the bill received the last\r\nsanction of the Peers. Lord Grenville then congratulated the House on\r\nthe completion, on its part, of the most glorious measure that had ever\r\nbeen adopted by any legislative body in the world.\r\n\r\nThe amendment now mentioned occasioned the bill to be sent back to the\r\nCommons. On the 24th, on the motion of Lord Howick, it was immediately\r\ntaken into consideration there, and agreed to; and it was carried back\r\nto the Lords, as approved of, on the same day.\r\n\r\nBut though the bill had now passed both houses, there was an awful fear\r\nthroughout the kingdom lest it should not receive the royal assent\r\nbefore the ministry was dissolved. This event took place the next day;\r\nfor on Wednesday, the 25th, at half past eleven in the morning, His\r\nMajesty's message was delivered to the different members of it, that\r\nthey were then to wait upon him to deliver up the seals of their\r\noffices. It then appeared that a commission for the royal assent to this\r\nbill, among others, had been obtained. This commission was instantly\r\nopened by the Lord Chancellor (Erskine), who was accompanied by the\r\nLords Holland and Auckland; and as the clock struck twelve, just when\r\nthe sun was in its meridian splendour to witness this august act, this\r\nestablishment of a Magna Charta for Africa in Britain, and to sanction\r\nit by its most vivid and glorious beams, it was completed. The ceremony\r\nbeing over, the seals of the respective offices were delivered up; so\r\nthat the execution of this commission was the last act of the\r\nadministration of Lord Grenville; an administration, which, on account\r\nof its virtuous exertions in behalf of the oppressed African race, will\r\npass to posterity, living through successive generations in the love and\r\ngratitude of the most virtuous of mankind.\r\n\r\nThus ended one of the most glorious contests, after a continuance for\r\ntwenty years, of any ever carried on in any age or country. A contest,\r\nnot of brutal violence, but of reason. A contest between those who felt\r\ndeeply for the happiness and the honour of their fellow-creatures, and\r\nthose, who, through vicious custom and the impulse of avarice, had\r\ntrampled under foot the sacred rights of their nature, and had even\r\nattempted to efface all title to the divine image from their minds.\r\n\r\nOf the immense advantages of this contest I know not how to speak;\r\nindeed, the very agitation of the question which it involved has been\r\nhighly important. Never was the heart of man so expanded; never were its\r\ngenerous sympathies so generally and so perseveringly excited. These\r\nsympathies, thus called into existence, have been useful in the\r\npreservation of a national virtue. For anything we know, they may have\r\ncontributed greatly to form a counteracting balance against the\r\nmalignant spirit, generated by our almost incessant wars during this\r\nperiod, so as to have preserved us from barbarism.\r\n\r\nIt has been useful also in the discrimination of moral character; in\r\nprivate life it has enabled us to distinguish the virtuous from the more\r\nvicious part of the community[A]. It has shown the general\r\nphilanthropist; it has unmasked the vicious in spite of his pretension\r\nto virtue. It has afforded us the same knowledge in public life; it has\r\nseparated the moral statesman from the wicked politician. It has shown\r\nus who, in the legislative and executive offices of our country, are fit\r\nto save, and who to destroy, a nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: I have had occasion to know many thousand persons in the\r\ncourse of my travels on this subject, and I can truly say, that the part\r\nwhich these took on this great question was always a true criterion of\r\ntheir moral character. Some indeed opposed the abolition, who seemed to\r\nbe so respectable, that it was difficult to account for their conduct;\r\nbut it invariably turned out, in the course of time, either that they\r\nhad been influenced by interested motives, or that they were not men of\r\nsteady moral principle. In the year 1792, when the national enthusiasm\r\nwas so great, the good were as distinguishable from the bad, according\r\nto their disposition to this great cause, as if the divine Being had\r\nmarked them, or, as a friend of mine the other day observed, as we may\r\nsuppose the sheep to be from the goats on the day of judgment.]\r\n\r\nIt has furnished us also with important lessons. It has proved what a\r\ncreature man is! how devoted he is to his own interest! to what a length\r\nof atrocity he can go, unless fortified by religious principle! But as\r\nif this part of the prospect would be too afflicting, it has proved to\r\nus, on the other hand, what a glorious instrument he may become in the\r\nhands of his Maker; and that a little virtue, when properly leavened, is\r\nmade capable of counteracting the effects of a mass of vice!\r\n\r\nWith respect to the end obtained by this contest, or the great measure\r\nof the abolition of the Slave Trade as it has now passed, I know not how\r\nto appreciate its importance; to our own country, indeed, it is\r\ninvaluable. We have lived, in consequence of it, to see the day, when it\r\nhas been recorded as a principle in our legislation, that commerce\r\nitself shall have its moral boundaries. We have lived to see the day\r\nwhen we are likely to be delivered from the contagion of the most\r\nbarbarous opinions. They who supported this wicked traffic, virtually\r\ndenied that man was a moral being; they substituted the law of force for\r\nthe law of reason: but the great act now under our consideration has\r\nbanished the impious doctrine, and restored the rational creature to his\r\nmoral rights. Nor is it a matter of less pleasing consideration, that,\r\nat this awful crisis, when the constitutions of kingdoms are on the\r\npoint of dissolution, the stain of the blood of Africa is no longer upon\r\nus, or that we have been freed (alas, if it be not too late!) from a\r\nload of guilt, which has long hung like a mill-stone about our necks,\r\nready to sink us to perdition.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the measure still further, or as it will affect other lands,\r\nwe become only the more sensible of its importance; for can we pass over\r\nto Africa; can we pass over to the numerous islands, the receptacles of\r\nmiserable beings from thence; and can we call to mind the scenes of\r\nmisery which have been passing in each of these regions of the earth,\r\nwithout acknowledging that one of the greatest sources of suffering to\r\nthe human race has, as far as our own power extends, been done way? Can\r\nwe pass over to these regions again, and contemplate the multitude of\r\ncrimes which the agency necessary for keeping up the barbarous system\r\nproduced, without acknowledging that a source of the most monstrous and\r\nextensive wickedness has been removed also? But here, indeed, it becomes\r\nus peculiarly to rejoice; for though nature shrinks from pain, and\r\ncompassion is engendered in us when we see it become the portion of\r\nothers, yet what is physical suffering compared with moral guilt? The\r\nmisery of the oppressed is, in the first place, not contagious like the\r\ncrime of the oppressor; nor is the mischief which it generates either so\r\nfrightful or so pernicious. The body, though under affliction, may\r\nretain its shape; and, if it even perish, what is the loss of it but of\r\nworthless dust? But when the moral springs of the mind are poisoned, we\r\nlose the most excellent part of the constitution of our nature, and the\r\ndivine image is no longer perceptible in us; nor are the two evils of\r\nsimilar duration. By a decree of Providence, for which we cannot be too\r\nthankful, we are made mortal. Hence the torments of the oppressor are\r\nbut temporary; whereas the immortal part of us, when once corrupted, may\r\ncarry its pollutions with it into another world.\r\n\r\nBut, independently of the quantity of physical suffering, and the\r\ninnumerable avenues to vice, in more than a quarter of the globe, which\r\nthis great measure will cut off, there are yet blessings, which we have\r\nreason to consider as likely to flow from it. Among these we cannot\r\noverlook the great probability that Africa, now freed from the vicious\r\nand barbarous effects of this traffic, may be in a better state to\r\ncomprehend and receive the sublime truths of the Christian religion. Nor\r\ncan we overlook the probability that, a new system of treatment\r\nnecessarily springing up in our islands, the same bright sun of\r\nconsolation may visit her children there. But here a new hope rises to\r\nour view. Who knows but that emancipation, like a beautiful plant, may,\r\nin its due season, rise out of the ashes of the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade, and that, when its own intrinsic value shall be known, the seed\r\nof it may be planted in other lands? And looking at the subject in this\r\npoint of view, we cannot but be struck with the wonderful concurrence of\r\nevents as previously necessary for this purpose, namely, that two\r\nnations, England and America, the mother and the child, should, in the\r\nsame month of the same year, have abolished this impious traffic;\r\nnations, which at this moment have more than a million of subjects\r\nwithin their jurisdiction to partake of the blessing; and one of which,\r\non account of her local situation and increasing power, is likely in\r\ntime to give, if not law, at least a tone to the manners and customs of\r\nthe great continent on which she is situated.\r\n\r\nReader! Thou art now acquainted with the history of this contest!\r\nRejoice in the manner of its termination!

By ARCHIBALD JOHN STEPHENS, M.A.,\r\nF.R.S., &c. Two Volumes, 30s.\r\n\r\nThe Introduction is embodied in the first volume, and extends from the\r\nearliest period of authentic history up to the termination of the reign\r\nof William III.; and the Saxon institutions, tenure of lands, domesday,\r\nthe royal prerogative, origin and progress of the legislative\r\nassemblies, privileges of Lords and Commons, pecuniary exactions,\r\nadministration of justice, gradual improvements in the laws, judicial\r\npowers of the Peers, borough institutions, infamy of the Long\r\nParliament, national dissensions, and the principles under which the\r\nexecutive power was intrusted to the Prince of Orange, have experienced\r\nevery illustration.\r\n\r\nThe doctrinal changes in the Anglican Church which were effected under\r\nthe Tudors, are justified by a reference to the records and practice of\r\nthe primitive Church, and the doctrinal schismatic points of Roman\r\nCatholic faith relating to the canons of Scripture, seven sacraments,\r\nsacrifice of the mass, private and solitary mass, communion in one kind,\r\ntransubstantiation, image worship, purgatory, indulgences, confession\r\nand penance, absolution, &c., are clearly established as being in direct\r\nopposition to the opinions of the early fathers, and the fundamental\r\ndoctrines of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe text of De Lolme is incorporated in the second volume, and the notes\r\naffixed extend to great length, and embody very valuable and diversified\r\ninformation relative to the rights, qualifications, and\r\ndisqualifications of members of Parliament and their constituents; the\r\nunions of Scotland and Ireland with England; the origin, rise, and\r\nprogress of the civil law under nine periods of the Roman history; civil\r\nprocess in the English courts of law; history of the courts of equity,\r\nand the principles under which they act; trial by jury, and an analysis\r\nof criminal offences, and the statutes under which they are punishable,\r\nwith an analysis of crimes that were committed in 1837, and of the\r\nsentences passed.

Both Romanists and Protestant Dissenters have been attentive\r\nto the important reign of Elizabeth, and by saying very little of each\r\nother, have given an invidious colouring to both the Church and the\r\nGovernment. The present work is meant to give every leading fact in\r\nsufficient detail, but to avoid unnecessary particulars.

The geographical position, natural\r\nproductions, and progress of civilization, in all the great monarchies\r\nand republics, have been diligently investigated, and their effect on\r\nthe fortunes of the state pointed out.

GLEIG, M.A. With PICTORIAL\r\nILLUSTRATIONS. 3 Vols., 6_s._ 6_d._ each.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of the FAMILY HISTORY OF ENGLAND has been to unite\r\nobjects which in such undertakings are not always found to coincide;\r\nnamely, to render the study of English History not merely instructive,\r\nbut interesting and amusing. For this purpose, the greatest care has\r\nbeen taken to seize upon all those striking features in the detail of\r\nevents, which not only convey to the mind of the reader a vivid picture\r\nof scenes past, but induce him to argue from effects to their causes.\r\nWhile the philosophy of history, therefore, is sedulously taught, it is\r\ntaught in a manner calculated to gratify both young and old, by\r\naffording to the one class ample scope to reflection; to the other,\r\nmatter that stirs and excites, while it conveys sound moral instruction.\r\n\r\nA HISTORY OF LONDON; THE PROGRESS OF ITS INSTITUTIONS; THE MANNERS AND\r\nCUSTOMS OF ITS PEOPLE. By CHARLES MACKAY. 7_s._\r\n\r\nOf the Histories of London which have hitherto appeared, some have been\r\ntoo voluminous and costly for the general reader, and others too\r\nexclusively addressed to the citizen, the antiquarian, or the traveller.\r\nThe object of the present Volume is to furnish in a tangible form, and\r\nat a small price, a general and popular view of the progress of\r\ncivilization, and of the origin and progress of those events which have\r\nraised London to its present importance. The work, however, is not\r\nconfined to a history of events, but contains graphic pictures of the\r\nmanners and customs of the people, their sports and pastimes, at\r\ndifferent periods, and the characteristic incidents of their domestic\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nGERMANY, BOHEMIA, AND HUNGARY, VISITED IN 1837. By the Rev. G.R. GLEIG,\r\nM.A., Chaplain to the Royal Hospital, Chelsea. Three Volume's, Post\r\nOctavo. 1_l._ 11_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nThe principal design of this work is to give some account of the state\r\nof society as it now exists in Bohemia and Hungary. In order to reach\r\nthese countries, the Author was, of course, obliged to pass through a\r\nlarge portion of Germany, where the social condition of the people, as\r\nwell as the civil, ecclesiastical, and military establishments,\r\nattracted his attention. Upon these he touches, more especially in\r\nreference to Prussia, towards which the eyes of the rest of Europe are\r\nat present anxiously turned. But his great design was to obtain and\r\ncommunicate information, respecting countries into which few Englishmen\r\nare accustomed to penetrate. Hence a large portion of his tour, both in\r\nBohemia and Hungary, was performed on foot; and the acquaintance which\r\nhe was thereby enabled to form with all ranks and conditions of the\r\npeople, was at once more intimate and more familiar than could have\r\ntaken place had he travelled by a more usual mode of conveyance. He\r\nlooked into the cottage as well as the palace, and he has given some\r\naccount of both.\r\n\r\nGERMANY; THE SPIRIT OF HER HISTORY, LITERATURE, SOCIAL CONDITION, AND\r\nNATIONAL ECONOMY; illustrated by Reference to her Physical, Moral, and\r\nPolitical Statistics, and by Comparison with other Countries.

By JOHN TOWERS, C.M.H.S. Second\r\nEdition, Enlarged and Improved. One large Volume, Octavo.\r\n\r\nMost of the works on gardening which have come under my observation, are\r\nnot only expensive, but appear to have been written almost exclusively\r\nfor the affluent;--for those who possess, or can afford to possess, all\r\nthe luxuries of the garden. We read of the management of hot-houses,\r\ngreen-houses, forcing-houses; of nursery-grounds, shrubberies, and other\r\nconcomitants of ornamental gardening. Now, although it is acknowledged\r\nthat many useful ideas may be gathered from these works, still it is\r\nobvious that they are chiefly written for those whose rank in life\r\nenables them to employ a chief gardener and assistants, qualified for\r\nthe performance of the many operations required in the various\r\ndepartments of large gardens. As I profess to have a very different\r\nobject in view, I address this book to those, who, without aiming to\r\nbecome professional gardeners, wish, nevertheless, to acquire so much of\r\nthe art of Gardening as shall enable them to conduct its more common and\r\nessential operations with facility and precision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMUSICAL HISTORY, BIOGRAPHY, AND CRITICISM; being a General Survey of\r\nMusic from the earliest Period to the Present Time.
