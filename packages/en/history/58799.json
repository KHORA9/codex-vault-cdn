BOXALL\r\n _Author of \"The Anglo-Saxon,\r\n a Study in Evolution,\" etc., etc._\r\n\r\n LONDON: T. FISHER UNWIN\r\n ADELPHI TERRACE, MCMVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _FIRST EDITION, September, 1899._\r\n\r\n _SECOND EDITION, May, 1902._\r\n\r\n _THIRD EDITION, May, 1908._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this story of the bushrangers I do not pretend to have included the\r\nnames of all those who have at various times been called bushrangers\r\nin Australia. That, as will be seen from what I have said in the\r\nearlier chapters, would be not merely impossible but useless. I\r\nbelieve, however, that I have collected some particulars about all\r\nthose who succeeded in winning even a local notoriety, and I have also\r\nendeavoured to supply such personal characteristics of the leaders\r\nin the movement as may throw some light on the causes which induced\r\nthem to \"take to the bush.\" My principal object, however, has been to\r\nmake the picture as complete as possible, so that the magnitude of\r\nthe social evil which the Australians set themselves to cure may be\r\nrealised; and it is generally believed in Australia that this cure has\r\nbeen so complete that bushranging will never again become epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe story is a terrible one. Some of the incidents related are no\r\ndoubt revolting, but it is necessary that even these should be told\r\nto show how civilised man may be degraded by unjust and oppressive\r\nlaws. We are all creatures of the educational influences to which we\r\nare subjected in our youth, and therefore it is unfair to blame the\r\nearlier bushrangers; because they were the products of the civilisation\r\nof their day, and were not themselves responsible. But sensational as\r\nthe story is, its tendency is rather to depress than to exhilarate\r\nthe reader, for the story is a sad one, in that it shows a deplorable\r\nwaste of what under happier conditions might have been useful lives.\r\nAs a rule I have adhered very closely to the newspaper reports of\r\nthe time, but to make the story (which naturally tends to be scrappy\r\nand disconnected) as homogeneous and continuous as possible, I have\r\nfollowed one gang to the close of its career, and then returned to take\r\nup the history of another gang. I have paid special attention to the\r\ngeography of the country, and the reader who possesses a fairly good\r\nmap of each of the colonies should have no difficulty in following the\r\nmovements of each of the gangs, and may thus obtain an idea of the\r\nextent of the area over which it operated.\r\n\r\nHitherto the histories of Australia have passed very lightly over\r\nthe bushrangers, but there can be no doubt that they exercised some\r\ninfluence, and not always for evil, for to their influence is due some\r\nof the sturdy Republicanism of the modern Australians. The publication\r\nof this story may perhaps assist the future historian in tracing the\r\ngrowth of public opinion in Australia, and will therefore not be\r\nwithout its use. It is in this hope that I submit it to the public.\r\n\r\n G.E.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES QUOTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Reports of the Select Committees of the House of Commons on\r\n  Transportation, Sessions 1837 and 1838: Chapters I., II., III., IV.\r\n\r\n  Report of the Special Commission of Enquiry into the state of the\r\n  Colony of New South Wales.

Where Bushranging First Began.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe species of brigandage known in Australia as bushranging was,\r\nwithout doubt, evolved, more or less directly, from the convict system\r\nestablished as the basis of the earlier settlements in the island\r\ncontinent. The first bushrangers were simply men who took to the bush\r\nto escape work and enjoy freedom of action. Under the harsh laws of the\r\nGeorgian era the greater criminals were hung, and not transported, and\r\nthe convicts sent to \"Botany Bay,\" in the eighteenth and the earlier\r\nyears of the nineteenth centuries, were generally men to whom the\r\ntrammels of the civilisation of their day were irksome. Many of them\r\nwere political agitators, industrial rioters, and machine-breakers.\r\nThe others were poachers and similarly comparatively mild offenders\r\nagainst the laws, who, under the present laws of Great Britain, would\r\nbe sufficiently punished with a few months' imprisonment. Many of these\r\nmen, when they were removed to a new land where the social conditions\r\ndid not press so heavily on them, became honest and reputable citizens,\r\nand, perhaps, but for the harsh treatment they were subjected to,\r\nnumbers of others who were driven to continue their fight against\r\nauthority, might also have lived quiet and useful lives. This subject\r\nis a very delicate one, and it is not my intention to pursue it\r\nfurther here; but if it could be fully treated without giving offence\r\nto numbers of worthy and, in some cases, justly honoured residents\r\nof Australia, some very valuable lessons might be learned from the\r\nhistories of some of those families whose founders could not live in\r\nEngland without offending against the laws, but who could and did earn\r\nthe respect of their fellow colonists in Australia who were not \"sent\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThe student of history in Australia is reminded, perhaps more forcibly\r\nthan his fellow in England, that the humanitarian spirit, now so\r\ndistinguishing a trait in the Anglo-Saxon character, is of very recent\r\ngrowth. Under the operation of this new force the criminal law of\r\nEngland was rapidly softened and ameliorated, and with every advance\r\nin this direction the character of the convicts sent out to Australia\r\nsteadily deteriorated, if I may so describe the process. With every\r\nalteration in the law a fresh class of criminal was transported, and\r\nthese with few exceptions would, a few months before, have been hung.\r\nAt first, pickpockets, then sheep and horse-stealers, forgers and\r\nothers, who had previously only escaped the gallows in rare instances,\r\nwhen they could find some influential friend to take sufficient\r\ninterest in them to plead their cause, were now transported as a matter\r\nof course. This process continued until transportation ceased, and as\r\nthe last batch of prisoners sent out was presumably the worst, having\r\nbeen guilty of more heinous crimes than their predecessors, we are too\r\napt to judge the earlier convicts harshly from our knowledge of the\r\nlater ones. The general effect was that while, with the amelioration\r\nof the laws, crime steadily decreased in England, it just as steadily\r\nincreased in Australia, and no doubt the worst criminals were\r\ntransported to Van Diemen's Land after transportation had ceased to\r\nNew South Wales in 1842. The laws of England previously to the great\r\nchanges made during the past sixty years seem to me to have operated,\r\nwhether designedly or not, to clear the country of the disaffected and\r\nthe discontented, rather than the criminal. How far the introduction of\r\nlarge numbers of this class into the country may have paved the way for\r\nmodern advances in liberal government in Australia, is a question which\r\nit might be profitable to study; but it only relates to the bushrangers\r\nso far as it enables us to account for the large number of men who\r\n\"took to the bush.\"\r\n\r\nThe earlier bushrangers seem to have been idle and dissolute, rather\r\nthan criminal, characters. They watched for an opportunity to escape\r\ninto a patch of scrub whenever the eye of the sentry in charge of\r\nthem was turned away, and the nature of the country was so favourable\r\nto this method of evasion that it constituted a continuous challenge\r\nto them to run away, and, almost incredible as it may appear now,\r\nnumbers of men started northward or westward in hopes of reaching the\r\nDutch or English settlements at Batavia, Singapore, Hong Kong, or\r\nsome other place in that direction. It must be remembered that the\r\nmajority of the working classes at the beginning of the century could\r\nnot read and had no knowledge of geography. They had heard sailors\r\nspeak of these settlements and had no idea that hundreds of miles of\r\nsea flowed between them and Australia. How many of these poor ignorant\r\nmen lost their lives in the attempt to achieve the impossible cannot\r\nbe said, but some terrible stories of cannibalism have been related\r\nin connection with this phase of bushranging. The majority of the\r\n\"runaways,\" however, had no such definite ideas as these, erroneous as\r\nthey may have been. They hoped to be able to live in freedom in the\r\nbush and to subsist on fruits, roots, or other native growths. Some few\r\njoined a tribe of blacks and stayed longer or shorter times with them;\r\nothers simply wandered about until hunger drove them back; while very\r\nmany remained at large until they were captured, and these lived by\r\nstealing from farmers and other settlers any articles which could be\r\neaten or sold. When one of these early bushrangers grew tired of his\r\nfreedom he gave himself up at the nearest police station and received\r\nfifty lashes. The penalty for a second offence was twelve months in a\r\nchain gang.\r\n\r\nThere was no adequate system of classifying the convicts. It was the\r\ncustom in advertising runaways to give the name of the man and that\r\nof the ship in which he was transported. Then followed the personal\r\ndescription, and that was all. It was admitted to be inconvenient,\r\nbut no attempt appears to have been made to improve it. Besides\r\nthis, for administration purposes, convicts were divided into three\r\nclasses according to their sentences. Thus there were men who had been\r\ntransported for \"seven\" years, for \"fourteen\" years, or for \"life.\"\r\nThey were also classified as \"young,\" \"middle-aged,\" and \"old,\" and\r\nusually the crime for which they had been transported was specified,\r\nbut such a description gave no indication of the character of the man.\r\nFinally they were divided into \"town thieves,\" \"rural labourers,\" and\r\n\"gentlemen.\" This was a step in the right direction, but it was too\r\nvague to be of much use. The educated convicts were all classified as\r\n\"gentlemen\" whether they came from the towns or the rural districts.[1]\r\nIt is worthy of note that the proportion of skilled labourers, or\r\ntradesmen as they are called, was very small. Very few men who had been\r\napprenticed to a trade were among the convicts sent to Australia at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThere were no regulations as to hours of work, and the severe\r\ntaskmaster might work his assigned servants as many hours as he\r\npleased. It was generally understood that Sunday was to be a holiday,\r\nor day of rest, but excuses were readily found for making the convicts\r\nwork on this day, and this was a fruitful source of discontent. Very\r\nfrequently men absconded on Saturday night, remained in the bush on\r\nSunday, and returned on Monday to take the customary fifty lashes and\r\nresume work.\r\n\r\nIf flogging is efficacious in preventing crime, it should have made\r\nthe convict colonies the most virtuous places on earth, for the\r\n\"cat\" was in almost continuous use in New South Wales and in Van\r\nDiemen's Land. The \"cat\" generally used was the ordinary military\r\nor naval cat; but \"the cat used at Macquarie Harbour was a larger\r\nand heavier instrument than that used generally for the punishment\r\nof soldiers or sailors. It was called the thief's cat, or double\r\ncat-o'-nine-tails. It had only the usual number of tails, but each of\r\nthese was a double twist of whipcord, and each tail had nine knots.\r\nIt was a very formidable instrument indeed.\"[2] How far the influence\r\nof this barbarous instrument of torture tended to make the prisoners\r\nat Macquarie Harbour the most reckless and ferocious of the convicts\r\nof Australia it is unnecessary to enquire, but there can be no doubt\r\nthat its influence was for evil and not for good. It is with the\r\nordinary \"cat,\" with which England in these barbarous times flogged\r\nher defenders as ferociously as she did her prisoners, that we have\r\nto deal; and, frightful as the tortures were which were inflicted on\r\nthe convicts, we have positive evidence that their lot was looked\r\nupon with envy by the soldiers who guarded them. Several soldiers in\r\nNew South Wales deliberately committed crime so that they might be\r\nconvicted, in the hope that, by good conduct, they might earn some of\r\nthe indulgences open to convicts. The fact is that any prisoner who\r\ncontrived, by obsequiousness or in any other way, to make friends with\r\nan official, had his way made easy for him, while the independent,\r\nwhether industrious or not, were ruthlessly persecuted until, in many\r\ncases, they were finally forced to the gallows.\r\n\r\n\"The prisoners of all classes in Government are fed with the coarsest\r\nfood; governed with the most rigid discipline; subjected to the\r\nstern, and frequently capricious and tyrannical will of an overseer;\r\nfor the slightest offence (sometimes for none at all--the victim of\r\nfalse accusation) brought before a magistrate, whom the Government\r\nhas armed with the tremendous powers of a summary jurisdiction, and\r\neither flogged, or sentenced to solitary confinement, or retransported\r\nto an iron gang, where he must work in heavy irons, or to a penal\r\nsettlement, where he will be ruled with a rod of iron. If assigned to\r\na private individual he becomes a creature of chance. He may fall into\r\nthe hands of a kind indulgent master, who will reward his fidelity with\r\nsuitable acknowledgments; but, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred,\r\nhe will find his employer suspicious, or whimsical, or a blockhead,\r\nnot knowing good conduct from bad, or a despot, who treats him like a\r\nslave, cursing and abusing, and getting him flogged for no reasonable\r\ncause. He may be harassed to the very death--he may be worked like a\r\nhorse, and fed like a chameleon. The master, though not invested by\r\nlaw with uncontrolled power, has yet great authority, which may be\r\nabused in a thousand ways precluding redress. Even his legal power is\r\nsufficiently formidable. A single act of disobedience is a sufficient\r\nground of complaint before the magistrate, and is always severely\r\ndealt with. But, besides the master's power, the prisoners are in some\r\nmeasure under a dominion to the free population at large; any man can\r\ngive him in charge without ceremony. If seen drunk, if seen tippling\r\nin the public-house, if met after hours in the street, if unable to\r\npay his trifling debt, if impertinent--the free man has nothing more\r\nto do than to send him to the watch-house, and get him punished. The\r\npoor prisoner is at the mercy of all men.\"[3] This appears to be a fair\r\nand unexaggerated statement of the conditions, and therefore it is\r\nlittle cause for wonder that the general tone of morality in the colony\r\nwas low. Mr. J.T. Bigge says that \"every opportunity was seized for\r\ncheating. When the convicts attended at the store to draw their weekly\r\nrations, supplies were frequently drawn for men not at work there.\r\nFalse lists of men employed in the various gangs were made out.\"[4]\r\nIn fact, the Government of the Colony was a military despotism under\r\nwhich corruption was rampant, so that the authorities themselves set an\r\nexample of immorality which the convicts were not slow to follow. \"The\r\npolice made a considerable revenue by blackmailing convicts who were in\r\nbusiness.\"[5] Those who could pay were allowed to continue to enjoy a\r\nfreedom to which they were not legally entitled, while those who would\r\nnot, or could not, be blackmailed, to satisfy the exorbitant demands\r\nof the so-called custodians of the peace, speedily \"got into trouble,\"\r\nand were prosecuted. It was said that if a man could escape from a\r\ncountry district and go to Sydney he might, if he could afford to dress\r\nwell, pass as a free man without attracting attention. A blacksmith\r\nnamed Brady, assigned to Major James Mudie, of Castle Forbes, eluded\r\nthe police in this way for nearly two years. He was recognised by a\r\nfellow convict, some time before he was captured, but this man \"let\r\nhim go for £5.\" Such cases, however, were exceptions to the general\r\nrule. The majority of runaways went into the bush and not into the\r\ntown, and the _Sydney and Hobart Town Gazettes_ in early times contain\r\nnumerous proclamations by the various governors calling upon all well\r\ndisposed persons to assist the military in capturing runaways. Some\r\nof the issues of these _Gazettes_ contain columns of the names and\r\ndescriptions of persons variously styled \"absconders,\" \"absentees,\"\r\n\"bolters,\" or \"bushrangers.\" In these the term \"bushranger\" appears\r\nmost frequently in New South Wales, while \"bolter\" was the more popular\r\nin Van Diemen's Land. The first bushrangers, therefore, were men who\r\n\"took to the bush\" to escape work, and therefore it was quite possible\r\nfor a man to be a bushranger without committing any depredations on his\r\nmore prosperous fellows.\r\n\r\nBut laziness was not the sole cause of bushranging in early times.\r\nA more powerful impulse perhaps was discontent, love of change.\r\n\"One of the most common indications of the misery of convicts under\r\nexisting circumstances is a passionate desire for change of place;\r\nand when serving considerate masters they are sometimes indulged in\r\nthis by being transferred (though always as a sort of punishment) to\r\ntheir disadvantage. In other cases, however, the desire becomes so\r\nstrong that they will steal, or commit some equal offence, expressly\r\nto be condemned to a road gang or penal settlement.\"[6] In fact the\r\nmonotony of their lives became insupportable, even in those cases\r\nwhere they were not cruelly treated. Captain Maconochie cites cases\r\nof men who have so acted within a few months of their being entitled\r\nto a ticket-of-leave, and who have thus forfeited their chances\r\nof freedom in the near future. In some cases this was due to the\r\n\"inhuman treatment\" of the master. In one case a valuable servant--a\r\nblacksmith--whose time had nearly expired, was goaded into running\r\naway so that he might be condemned to a further term of service before\r\nobtaining his ticket-of-leave, and this was not an isolated case.\r\n\r\n\"Generally,\" said Dr. J.D. Lang, \"the condition of the assigned\r\nservant in New South Wales is superior to that of the farm labourer\r\nof England. He is better clothed, better fed, and as comfortably\r\nlodged. He is under personal restraint, not being allowed to leave\r\nhis master's property without a pass, but he has many comforts and\r\nmeans of amusement which render his situation by no means irksome or\r\nsevere.\"[7] But it was just this restraint which the persons with\r\nwhom we are now dealing found intolerable. They had not the patience,\r\nthe long-suffering resignation of the English farm labourer. Many of\r\nthem had been English farm labourers and had found the conditions in\r\nwhich they lived intolerable, and when they realised that they had not\r\nvery much improved these conditions by being sent to Australia, they\r\nrebelled again. \"The experience furnished by the penal settlements,\"\r\nsaid Judge Forbes, \"has proved that transportation is capable of being\r\ncarried to an extreme of suffering such as to render death desirable,\r\nand to induce many prisoners to seek it under its most appalling\r\naspects.... I have known cases in which it appeared that men had\r\ncommitted crimes at Norfolk Island, for the mere purpose of being\r\nsent to Sydney to be tried, and the cause of their desiring to be so\r\nsent was to avoid the state of endurance in which they were placed in\r\nNorfolk Island.\" ... Several cases occurred in which \"men at Norfolk\r\nIsland cut the heads of their fellow-prisoners with the hoe while at\r\nwork, with the certainty of being detected, and the certainty of being\r\nexecuted. They did this without malice, and when charged said it was\r\nbetter to be hung than to live in such a hell.\"[8] Sir Richard Bourke\r\nsaid: \"Capital crimes have been committed in that penal settlement from\r\na desperate determination to stake the chance of capital conviction and\r\npunishment in Sydney against the chances of escape which the passage\r\nmight afford to the accused and to the witnesses summoned to attend the\r\ntrial.\"[9] The early bushrangers of Australia ranged therefore from\r\nthe comparatively innocent wanderer in the bush, to such desperadoes\r\nas these, while the crimes they committed varied from petty theft to\r\nburglary, bank robbery, robbery on the high road, and murder. The\r\nmodern idea of a bushranger is a bold highwayman, and no doubt many of\r\nthe bushrangers come up to this ideal, but the story of the bushrangers\r\nwould not be complete if it took no note of the others.\r\n\r\nThe settlement on Norfolk Island was established with the view\r\nof sending all the reconvicted prisoners there. It was the penal\r\nsettlement of a penal settlement. It was abandoned for a time, after\r\nthe founding of a similar settlement on the banks of the Derwent river\r\nin Van Diemen's Land, but was re-established as a place of punishment\r\nin connection with that colony, and many of the most notorious of\r\nthe bushrangers ended their days there, as we shall see later. It\r\nwas in the convict settlements in those islands that the greatest\r\nbrutalities were perpetrated on the prisoners, and Norfolk Island,\r\nMacquarie Harbour, and Port Arthur were each known as \"The Hell\" among\r\nthe \"old hands,\" as the convicts were called after transportation had\r\nbeen abolished. It was in these settlements that the more violent\r\nand refractory of the convicts were gradually collected, and the\r\nhistory of these places tends to prove that brutality cannot be cured\r\nby brutal means. Flogging which was an every-day occurrence had no\r\nreformatory effect. The early bushrangers thought nothing of it. It\r\ncertainly did not deter them from absconding whenever they thought\r\nfit. When an absconder tired of wandering about the bush, he returned\r\nto the settlement to take his flogging \"like a man.\" In the stories\r\ntold by the old hands, the absconder or offender in some other way was\r\nrepresented as walking jauntily up to the triangles, throwing off his\r\njumper, placing himself in position for tying, and then, when he had\r\nbeen secured, telling the flagellator to do his \"d----est,\" and, if\r\nthe descriptions of the manner in which the floggers performed their\r\ntask which have come down to us are true, the punishment was a terrible\r\none. It is said that there were two floggers in Sydney who were\r\nregarded as artists in their profession. These men performed together,\r\nthe one being right-handed and the other left. They prided themselves\r\non being able to flog a man without breaking the skin, and consequently\r\nthere was no blood spilled. But the back of the flogged man is\r\ndescribed as having been puffed up like \"blown veal.\" The swelling\r\n\"shook like jelly,\" and the effects were felt for a much longer period\r\nthan when the back was cut and scored as it generally was, for we are\r\ntold that the ground, in the Barrack Square in Sydney, all round where\r\nthe triangles stood, was saturated with human blood, and the flogging\r\nplaces elsewhere must have been in the same condition. But to return.\r\nWhen the man had received his dose and was cast loose, he would throw\r\nhis jumper across his shoulders and walk away with a grin--or with some\r\nsuch remarks as \"Well, is that all you can do?---- you!\" and afterwards\r\nboast that \"the---- couldn't get a whimper\" out of him. I have heard a\r\nstory of a man who was flogged. The flagellator kept hitting him low\r\ndown across the loins. The prisoner turned his head round once and said\r\nfiercely: \"Hit higher, blast you!\" The flogger took no notice, and the\r\nprisoner made no other sign until he was untied. Then he knocked the\r\nflogger down with his fist, and was immediately seized up for another\r\n\"dose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you, from personal observation, that it is not uncommon\r\nto see a poor wretch working on the roads, or labouring in the fields,\r\nwith his coarse shirt sticking to the green and tainted flesh of his\r\nlacerated back, and that, too, for the most venial offence.... I\r\nhave it from unquestionable authority, that it frequently occurs in\r\nthe summer season that the eggs of the blue-fly become inserted and\r\nhatched in the wounds of the punished offender, from which they are\r\noccasionally extracted by some humane companion.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThe blow-fly in Australia, although frequently called \"blue-bottle,\"\r\nis not blue. It deposits its young alive in the form of maggots, and\r\ngreat care has always to be taken to prevent sores on man or beast from\r\nbeing \"blown.\" It is very common for flannel shirts, which have become\r\ngreasy from perspiration, to be blown on the backs of workmen, and the\r\nmaggots thus deposited will attack and irritate any scratch or sore\r\nthey can find if not removed quickly.\r\n\r\nThe convict, so far from having been ashamed of being flogged, boasted\r\nof it. But nothing pleased them better than the relations of stories\r\nabout the flogging of \"freemen,\" as those settlers who had gone to the\r\ncolonies neither as convicts nor officials were called. One story,\r\nwhich may or may not be true, has been told as having occurred in every\r\nconvict district in Australia. It was to the effect that a master one\r\nday gave a letter to an assigned servant and told him to take it to\r\nthe nearest gaol. The servant, surmising that the letter was somewhat\r\nto the following effect:--\"Dear Sir,--Please give the bearer fifty\r\nfor absconding (or what not), and oblige, yours truly, &c.,\" told a\r\nplausible tale to the first freeman he met and induced him to deliver\r\nthe letter. The point of the story generally lay in the ingenuity\r\nwith which the convict induced the freeman to deliver the letter for\r\nhim, but the astonishment of the freeman when he was seized up to the\r\ntriangles in spite of his struggles and protestations, and given the\r\n\"fifty,\" was a perpetual source of joy and hilarity to the convicts who\r\nheard the story. There is nothing inherently improbable in this story.\r\nIt is quite probable that the incident may have occurred more than\r\nonce. Although freemen were legally exempt from flogging, unless under\r\nsentence of a qualified Court, many authentic instances of freemen\r\nhaving been flogged have been told. Here is one. \"A store-keeper in\r\nHobart Town had offended his neighbours, and one of them, in revenge,\r\nposted a written placard libelling the offender. The placard was\r\naffixed to a big gum stump at the corner of Collins and Elizabeth\r\nStreets. Just as the complainant was putting this bill on the stump\r\nthe man libelled in it passed and called the attention of the Military\r\nCommandant, who was near at hand at the time, to it. A sort of informal\r\ndrum-head Court Martial was held on the spot, and the libeller was\r\nfound guilty and sentenced to receive three hundred lashes, which were\r\nadministered at once, in spite of the protests of the victim that he\r\nwas a freeman and was therefore entitled to a judicial trial. When\r\ntwo hundred lashes had been administered, a cry of 'Ship ho' was\r\nraised, and the last hundred was got rid of as quickly as possible, the\r\nCommandant, the flagellator, the spectators, and others all rushing\r\naway to the wharf to hear the news from Europe.\"[11] If the law could\r\nbe thus set at defiance by a military official in the case of a free\r\nimmigrant holding a good position, what chance of justice could there\r\nbe for a convict? A story illustrating the reckless manner in which\r\nprisoners were flogged is told by the _Launceston Advertiser_. \"A\r\nprisoner was found guilty of absconding, and sentenced to receive fifty\r\nlashes, when some circumstances were disclosed which proved that the\r\nprisoner was innocent, but had lost his pass. 'Never mind,' said the\r\nLaunceston magistrate, 'the warrant is signed, let him be punished now;\r\nI will forgive him the next time he's brought up.'\" The tyranny of the\r\nofficials was boundless. One Government rule was that all convicts\r\nshould take off their hats to officers and officials whenever they\r\npassed. In January, 1839, a party of convicts was building some steps\r\nat Woolloomooloo Bay, on Sir Maurice O'Connell's estate. Several of\r\nthem were rolling a heavy stone down to be placed in position when an\r\nofficer passed along and the convicts immediately rose up and took\r\ntheir hats off. The stone rolled quickly down the steep embankment,\r\nstruck the overseer and knocked him down, almost breaking his leg.\r\nCaptain O'Connell gave orders that the men should not salute anybody\r\nin future while at work. A few days later Colonel Wilson, Chief\r\nPolice Magistrate of Sydney, passed, accompanied by his daughter. The\r\nconvicts continued at work without noticing him. \"Take off your hats,\"\r\ncried the Colonel. Several of the men did so, but Joseph Todd, who\r\nwas carrying a heavy load, took no notice. \"Take off your hat, you\r\nscoundrel,\" said the Colonel. Todd said he had been ordered not to.\r\nThe Colonel shouted \"I'll have your back skinned for you, you rascal,\"\r\ncalled the sergeant of police who acted as guard, and gave Todd in\r\ncharge. Captain O'Connell appeared to defend his man and said Colonel\r\nWilson was trespassing and had no right to interfere with assigned\r\nservants on their master's estate. Sergeant Goodwin deposed that the\r\npath was a common one and people frequented it to get to the bathing\r\nplace. Sergeant Mather said that Todd had struggled when arrested.\r\nThe Bench held that Todd being an assigned servant had been guilty of\r\ndisorderly conduct in resisting the police. Had he been a freeman he\r\nwould have been justified in resisting arrest without a warrant; but,\r\nbeing a prisoner, his conduct had been highly disorderly, and he was,\r\ntherefore, sentenced to receive fifty lashes. A week later Todd was\r\nagain arrested for being out after hours, and was sentenced to receive\r\nthirty lashes. The paper in reporting this charged Colonel Wilson with\r\ntyrannical conduct, and says that he went to see Todd flogged.[12]\r\n\r\nI am not relating the worst cases in order to \"make out a case\" for the\r\nbushrangers, but simply facts to illustrate the life in the colonies at\r\nthe time, and thus account for the large number of men who \"took to the\r\nbush,\" and the special Acts passed to prevent this breach of the law\r\nwere as tyrannical as the acts of the officials or the masters which\r\nwent so far to create it. The \"Bushranging Act\" (11 George IV., No. 10)\r\nauthorised the military or civil police to arrest any person on the\r\nmere suspicion that he or she was illegally at large, and the onus of\r\nproof was thrown on the suspected party. This Act was a fruitful source\r\nof complaint. No one was safe except well known officials, and it is\r\nsaid that the Act was extensively used for purposes of extortion and\r\nblack mail. A young woman was arrested by an ex-constable and charged\r\nwith being illegally at large. It was in vain that she protested that\r\nshe was \"free\" and did not require a pass. He insisted on taking her to\r\nthe lock-up. Fortunately, while walking along the street she met some\r\none who knew her and who threatened the ex-policeman with prosecution\r\nif he did not release her. The fellow did so and was not prosecuted.\r\nProbably had an enquiry been held it would have been found that he was\r\nacting in collusion with the police. Even the officials were not always\r\nsafe. Mr. Jacques, the Government auctioneer, had been to a dinner\r\nparty. Being near the Custom House he decided to walk to the wharf from\r\nwhence the steamer, which ran to Balmain, started and go home in her.\r\nNot having walked to the wharf from that point before, he found it\r\nnecessary to apply to a constable for information as to which turning\r\nhe should take, and was immediately arrested as a convict illegally at\r\nlarge. In spite of his protests he was conveyed to the nearest police\r\nstation. The sergeant in charge refused to believe his story, and\r\nthought that the presence of a well-dressed man in that quarter was\r\nsuspicious. Mr. Jacques was therefore detained till morning, when he\r\nwas recognised by the magistrate and discharged. In 1834 a circular\r\nletter was addressed by the Governor to the various police-magistrates\r\nin New South Wales, enquiring whether, in their opinion, the Act\r\nshould be reaffirmed or not, and the replies were by a large majority\r\nin favour of its being continued, while others merely suggested that\r\nit might be amended in various ways to prevent the abuses which had\r\ngrown up under its operation. Judge Burton was almost alone in his\r\ncondemnation of the Bushranging Act, which, he said, was repugnant to\r\nthe laws of England. \"England and the United States of America,\" he\r\nsaid, \"are the only two countries in the world where passports are not\r\ncompulsory,\" and he deprecated the introduction of the passport system\r\ninto Australia. It was held that the conditions existing in the colony\r\nmade such an act necessary, and it was therefore re-enacted without\r\namendment.[13] It is worthy of note, as illustrating Colonial Office\r\nprocedure of that day, that it was the paid officials, and not the\r\npublic, who were consulted in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe facts being as I have stated, the wonder is not that large numbers\r\nof prisoners \"took to the bush\" but that all did not do so, and the\r\nmore we study the early history of the convict settlements the less\r\nwe feel inclined to blame the early bushrangers, however savage or\r\natrocious their actions were. But we have not yet quite escaped from\r\nbarbarism. In spite of the positive evidence that flogging brutalises\r\nand does not reform it is still continued. We also continue to hang\r\ncriminals, although there is no proof that it deters crime or effects\r\nany good whatever. I do not belong to any society for the abolition of\r\ncapital punishment. I may admit that perhaps there may be men whose\r\ndeath is desirable or expedient; but, if it is so, if there are men\r\nunfit to live or whose death might add to the happiness or security\r\nof the majority, then I think that we might extend to our fellow\r\ncreatures, however ferocious or abandoned they may be, the mercy which\r\nwe show to savage or superfluous dogs and cease from torturing them\r\nin their last moments. Hanging has had a sufficiently lengthy trial\r\nin Australia if it has not in England. Old residents in Sydney or in\r\nHobart Town or in any other locality where penal settlements have\r\nexisted can point out numbers of places where the gallows has been\r\nerected, and in some cases trees are still standing where numbers of\r\nmen have struggled away their last few moments of life. This, however,\r\nis not the place to enlarge upon this subject, but the story I have\r\nto tell shows a lamentable waste of life, and many even of the more\r\nnotorious of the bushrangers have exhibited qualities which might under\r\nhappier conditions have fitted them for useful work. This is specially\r\ntrue of the earlier bushrangers who were the victims generally of\r\nunjust laws. Of the later ones, the native-born bushrangers, it is\r\nimpossible to speak in the same terms. They were not driven to crime\r\nby want or oppression, but they were the vicious products of a vicious\r\npast. Their crimes were due to vicious environment and education, but\r\nthey are gone now and, if we may draw some lessons of utility for the\r\nfuture, even their lives may not have been altogether wasted.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence I have adduced it will be seen that the early\r\nbushrangers were very numerous. \"In one case it became known,\" said Mr.\r\nJames Macarthur, \"that a gang of about sixty convicts, employed in the\r\nGovernment gangs in Liverpool, intended to break out on a certain night\r\nand take to the bush. It was considered advisable to allow them to\r\nbreak out, proper precautions having been made to capture them. It was\r\nthe intention to attack our farming stations at Camden. We armed twelve\r\nof the best-conducted of our convict servants, but the absconders found\r\nthat their design had been discovered and did not attempt to put it in\r\nforce.\"[14] Thus the bushrangers did not always go out singly, or in\r\ntwos or threes. Mr. J.T. Bigge says: \"At Windsor, and in the adjoining\r\ndistricts, the offence termed bushranging, or absconding in the\r\nwoods, and living upon plunder and the robbing of orchards, are most\r\nprevalent.... At Emu Plains, or the district of Evan, gambling, absence\r\nfrom work, insolence to overseers, neglect of work, and stealing, are\r\nthe most common offences.... As the population of New South Wales has,\r\nuntil lately, been virtually limited to the occupation of a small\r\ntract of land that lies between the Blue Mountains and the sea, and as\r\nfew temptations to plunder existed in the tracts contiguous to these\r\nboundaries, excepting those that are afforded by the wild cattle in\r\nthe cow-pastures, the offence of bushranging, or continued absence in\r\nthe woods, has not of late been common. Instances have occurred of the\r\ndeparture of convicts for the purpose of traversing the country with a\r\nview to escape, of the escape of some from Newcastle, sent thither for\r\npunishment, and their wandering and temporary existence in the vicinity\r\nof Windsor; and latterly, a few instances of escape from the road\r\nparties in the districts of Liverpool and Bathurst; but there has been\r\nno systematic or continued efforts of desperate convicts to defy the\r\nattempts of the local Government in New South Wales, or to subsist by\r\nplunder, such as have existed until a very late period in Van Diemen's\r\nLand.\"[15]\r\n\r\nIt is in Van Diemen's Land, therefore, that our story of the more\r\nserious phases of bushranging first begins.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Evidence of Sir Francis Forbes, Chief Justice of New South\r\nWales.

Subsequently other penal stations were opened, and of these\r\nwe shall hear later. The island continued to be the chief penal\r\nestablishment of New South Wales until 1825, when it was erected into\r\nan independent colony. The first shipment of convicts, direct from\r\nEngland to Van Diemen's Land, took place in 1823, and from that date,\r\nuntil transportation to the island finally ceased, in 1853, 64,306\r\nconvicts were sent to that colony from the British Isles. The number\r\nsent previously from New South Wales was not large, nevertheless\r\nit included the majority of the most turbulent of the convicts and\r\nrelieved the mother colony of their charge and control. The island was\r\nin fact \"nothing but a jail on a large scale.\"[16] The early conditions\r\nin the colony appear to have been favourable to bushranging. In 1805\r\nthere was such a dearth of food stuffs, owing to the non-arrival of\r\nstore ships from Sydney, that a famine appeared to be imminent and,\r\nto relieve the store, the Lieutenant Governor ordered the liberation\r\nof the convicts and sent them into the woods to catch kangaroo and\r\nother wild animals for food. When the stores arrived and food became\r\nplentiful, the attempts to recall the convicts were only partially\r\nsuccessful. Many had learned how to subsist in the bush and disregarded\r\nthe proclamations issued by the Lieutenant Governor ordering them to\r\nreturn to work. At first the bushrangers or bolters were similar to\r\nthose of New South Wales and contented themselves with petty thefts.\r\nThe first proclamation in which reference is made to \"a gang of\r\nbushrangers\" was published in the Hobart Town _Gazette_ by Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Davey and dated September 10th, 1810. It offered rewards and\r\nindulgences to convicts for the capture of any members of a gang which,\r\nunder the leadership of a convict named Whitehead, had been committing\r\ndepredations on the property of settlers and farmers in the vicinity of\r\nHobart Town.\r\n\r\nWhitehead, therefore, was the first to organise a gang which combined\r\nhighway robbery with burglary and petty larceny. Bushrangers were not\r\nat that time specialists. From time to time other proclamations were\r\nissued in which this gang was mentioned, but it was not until May 14th,\r\n1813, that a special proclamation was published, calling upon the\r\n\"bolters\" to surrender. Those who neglected to obey this order were to\r\nbe proclaimed \"outlaws\" on December 1st.\r\n\r\nVery few particulars are published about this gang in the newspapers,\r\nand the proclamations rarely specify the facts in connection with the\r\nrobberies committed. The newspapers of the time seldom mention the\r\nnames of the bushrangers, and appear to have been quite as averse to\r\nmentioning the Christian names as the modern English papers are those\r\nof professional cricketers. Thus Whitehead is referred to as \"the\r\nconvict Whitehead,\" or the \"notorious bushranger Whitehead,\" and so\r\non. He is debited, however, with one horrible crime. The gang captured\r\na half-crazy fellow named John Hopkins, and accused him of trying to\r\nbetray them. As a punishment for this offence a pair of moccassins,\r\nroughly made of bullock hide, was fitted on to his feet, and in these\r\nwere placed a number of the great red ants, commonly known in Australia\r\nas \"bull-dog\" or \"soldier\" ants (_myrmecia gulosa_). These ants are\r\nan inch and a quarter long, and of most ferocious appearance. They are\r\nthe dread of the colonists. They sting quite as severely as a bee or a\r\nhornet. But a bee stings only once, while a soldier ant will continue\r\nto sting until removed. It is always ready to fight, and never lets go\r\nwhen it has taken hold; hence its popular names. The horrible barbarity\r\nof such a punishment can be best appreciated, perhaps, by those who\r\nhave inadvertently stood on a \"soldier's\" bed or nest. The victim is\r\nsaid to have died in agony.\r\n\r\nWhitehead was shot by a party of soldiers in October, 1814, and Michael\r\nHowe, commonly called the \"First of the Australian Bushrangers,\"\r\nwas elected captain of the gang in his stead. Mike Howe, as he was\r\nusually called, was transported from England for highway robbery, and\r\nsoon after his arrival at Sydney \"got into trouble,\" and was again\r\ntransported to Van Diemen's Land, where his violence caused him to\r\nbe repeatedly flogged and otherwise punished. He made his escape\r\nand joined Whitehead's gang, and soon, by his superior education,\r\ngained an ascendency over his comrades. His previous experiences as\r\na footpad in England no doubt tended to fit him for the leadership\r\nof the gang, and he is still regarded as one of the most notable\r\nof the revolters against law and order in the colonies. One of his\r\nearlier achievements was to organise a raid on a tribe of blacks for\r\nthe purpose of providing himself and his comrades with wives. This is\r\nsaid to have been the first act in the tragedy which closed with the\r\ncomplete annihilation of the blacks of the island. The savages, of\r\ncourse, resisted, and many of them were shot, and the women were forced\r\naway to the bushrangers' camp. In revenge, the blacks attacked, not the\r\nbushrangers' camp, but the houses of settlers who had no connection\r\nwith the bushrangers, and fights between the settlers and the blacks\r\nbecame frequent. Some of the black women seem to have become reconciled\r\nto the change, and Howe's \"wife,\" Black Mary, is associated with him in\r\nmost of the stories told of him. It is said that it was her knowledge\r\nof the bush which enabled him to escape so frequently from the military\r\nbands sent out to capture him.\r\n\r\nHowe addressed a letter \"From the Bushrangers to the Hon. T. Davey,\r\nLieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land,\" in which he protested\r\nagainst the charge, made against himself and his mates in the\r\nproclamations, of having been guilty of \"horrid and detestable\r\ncrimes.\" He asserted that he had never committed murder and had only\r\nused violence when it was necessary to avoid capture. The letter was\r\nconveyed to Hobart Town by an American whaler named Richard Westlick,\r\nwho had an interview with his Excellency, and was sent back with a\r\nverbal message that the Governor \"did not wish to take the life of any\r\nman,\" but merely to preserve order. If, therefore, Howe, or any of his\r\ncomrades, would surrender no charges should be made against them for\r\ntheir acts while \"in the bush.\" No notice was taken of this generous\r\noffer, and the depredations continued. Later on Mike Howe addressed a\r\nletter \"From the Governor of the Ranges to the Governor of the Town,\"\r\nand sent it to Lieutenant Governor Sorell, who had succeeded Colonel\r\nDavey. In this the bushranger offered to give himself up on condition\r\nthat he received a free pardon. He demanded that some recognised\r\nofficial should be sent to meet him at an appointed spot, so that they\r\nmight \"confer as gentleman to gentleman.\" The fact that this insolent\r\noffer was accepted affords incontrovertible evidence of the power of\r\nthe bushrangers, and shows the anxiety of the Governor to put a stop\r\nto the robberies which harassed the industrious settlers and made the\r\nroads of the colony unsafe. Captain Nairne, of the 46th Regiment, was\r\nsent out to meet the bushranger, and the result of their conference\r\n\"as gentlemen\" was that Howe accompanied the Captain back to Hobart\r\nTown. On his arrival there he was informed that the Lieutenant Governor\r\nhad no power to grant pardons, but that he would write to Governor\r\nMacquarie in Sydney and urge him to grant a pardon without delay. Howe\r\nagreed to wait in Hobart Town. He was liberated on parole, and soon\r\nbecame very popular in the city. Then a rumour began to spread to the\r\neffect that Howe had committed no less than four murders, not reckoning\r\nthe blacks he had killed, and that, therefore, the Governor declined\r\nto grant him a pardon. As soon as Howe heard this rumour he, without\r\nwaiting for its confirmation, broke his parole and returned to the\r\nbush. A proclamation was immediately issued declaring him an outlaw,\r\nand offering one hundred pounds reward for his capture, dead or alive.\r\nSmaller rewards were offered for other members of his gang, whose names\r\nwere known.\r\n\r\nThe estimates of the strength of his gang vary extremely from time to\r\ntime. Sometimes he is said to have a hundred or more followers, while\r\nfrequently he is represented as acting alone or in company with only\r\none or two others. The facts appear to be that many men, who merely\r\n\"bolted\" into the bush as a relief to the monotony of their lives,\r\nbecame bushrangers; and, when hard pressed, or when they tired of that\r\npursuit, returned to the town, gave themselves up, and were punished as\r\nordinary bolters. One day, not very long after his escape from Hobart\r\nTown, Howe was surprised while asleep by two ticket-of-leave men named\r\nWatts and Drew. They captured and tied him. Howe fought like a lion and\r\ncontrived to break the rope with which he was tied. He snatched a knife\r\nand stabbed Watts. He then seized Watts' gun and shot Drew dead. Watts\r\nran away, while Howe was employed in re-loading the gun, and managed\r\nto secrete himself in the scrub for a time. When the way was clear he\r\ncrawled to a farm and gave information. He was cared for as well as\r\ncircumstances permitted, but he died from loss of blood before a doctor\r\ncould be brought to him. Howe was followed by the military, but escaped.\r\n\r\nSeveral skirmishes took place between Howe and his gang and the\r\nsoldiers, and more than one of his accomplices were shot, but the\r\nchief always contrived to get away. At length a kangaroo hunter named\r\nWarburton led William Pugh, a soldier commonly known as \"Big Bill,\" and\r\na seaman named John Worrall, to where Howe was camped under a gum tree.\r\nA terrific fight took place, Howe's brains being beaten out before it\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nIn his review of this period, Mr. J.T. Bigge said: \"The excesses of\r\nthe bushrangers in the neighbourhood of Port Dalrymple, and likewise\r\nnear Hobart Town, had attained their utmost height and most sanguinary\r\ncharacter at the latter end of the year 1813. They had been joined\r\nby two persons who had held subordinate stations in the commisariat\r\ndepartment, named Peter Mills and George Williams, and continued\r\na system of violent depredations upon the homes and property of\r\nindividuals of every description. So great was the intimidation\r\nproduced by their combined efforts, that the inhabitants of several\r\ndistricts abandoned their dwellings and removed for safety to the\r\ntowns.... Colonel Davey issued a proclamation offering rewards for the\r\napprehension of a party of nine, and with the advice of Mr. Ellis Bent\r\nanother proclamation calling upon them to surrender before December\r\n1st.... The effect of this was the reverse of what was intended. It\r\nincreased the crimes and audacity of the bushrangers during the six\r\nmonths that it allowed for their return; they profited by the pardon\r\nby making a temporary surrender, and then resumed their habits of\r\nplunder.... Hector McDonald, the leader, was shot by two convicts sent\r\nin pursuit of a gang of four. Another was shot by a soldier of the 48th\r\nregiment, and the other three were captured and on conviction flogged\r\nand transported.\"[17]\r\n\r\nFor the time, bushranging in Van Diemen's Land was said to have been\r\nput down, but \"the Guerilla War\" between the whites and the blacks,\r\ninaugurated by the bushrangers, continued. Mr. Gilbert Robertson was\r\nappointed conciliator, with a view to arranging terms of peace, but he\r\nwas not very successful. Several proclamations were issued assuring the\r\nblacks that if they would come in and make peace the Government would\r\nendeavour to protect them against their enemies the bushrangers; but,\r\nas was pointed out at the time, issuing proclamations to savages who\r\ncould not read was absurd. Then a pictorial proclamation was issued. In\r\none portion the governor was shown shaking hands with a blackfellow;\r\nin others blacks and whites were exhibited mingling together in\r\nfriendship. In the two bottom compartments a white man was shown being\r\nhung for having shot a black, while a blackfellow was being hung for\r\nhaving speared a white man. Copies of this pictorial proclamation\r\nwere posted on trees and other places where the blacks might see it.\r\nLieutenant Governor Arthur in fact, on his arrival in the colony, tried\r\nby every means in his power to appeal to the blacks and whites alike.\r\nHe endeavoured to restrain the settlers from attacking and driving the\r\nblacks away from their farms whenever they appeared, as had become the\r\ncustom, but some new outrage by the bushrangers gave a new impulse to\r\nthe feud, and the settlers were compelled to fight in self-defence. In\r\none of his despatches to the Colonial Secretary Governor Arthur said:\r\n\"It is not a matter of surprise that the injuries real or supposed,\r\ninflicted on the blacks, have been avenged upon the whites whenever\r\nan occasion presents itself; and I regret to say that the natives\r\nled on by a Sydney black, and by two aborigines of this island, men\r\npartially civilised (a circumstance which augurs ill for any endeavour\r\nto instruct these abject beings), have committed many murders upon the\r\nshepherds and herdsmen in remote settlements.... I have long indulged\r\nthe expectation that kindness and forbearance would have brought about\r\nsomething like a reconciliation, but the repeated murders which have\r\nbeen committed have so greatly inflamed the passions of the settlers,\r\nthat petitions and complaints have been presented from every part of\r\nthe colony, and the feeling of resentment now runs so high that further\r\nforbearance would be totally indefensible.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe Sydney black here mentioned was known as Musquito. He was\r\ntransported to Van Diemen's Land for the murder of a black gin\r\n(presumably his wife, which is no crime according to native law) in\r\n1823, and having been employed on a cattle station in New South Wales,\r\nwas appointed stock-keeper. Later, he was employed as a tracker, and\r\naided the soldiers in capturing some of the bushrangers. For this he\r\nwas so persecuted by his fellow convicts that life became a burden\r\nto him. He appealed to the authorities for protection; but, as this\r\nwas not accorded to him, he became a bushranger himself. \"Perhaps\r\ntaken collectively the sable natives of this colony are the most\r\npeaceable creatures in the universe. Certainly so taken they have never\r\ncommitted any acts of cruelty, or even resisted the whites, unless\r\nwhen insufferably goaded by provocation. The only tribe who have done\r\nany mischief were corrupted by Musquito, a Sydney black, who, with\r\nmuch perverted cunning, taught them a portion of his own villainy, and\r\nincited them after a time to join in his delinquencies.\"[19]\r\n\r\nKnowing, as we do, the general character of the Australian blacks, it\r\nseems strange that one of them should prove himself so much superior\r\nto the Van Diemen's Land blacks as Musquito is represented to have\r\ndone. But however that may be, there can be no doubt as to his skill in\r\norganisation. Some of his attacks on settlers were so skilfully planned\r\nand carried out, that many persons believed that the blacks had been\r\nled by a white man. After about two years of bushranging, Musquito and\r\nBlack Jack, the two leaders, were captured. Musquito was charged with\r\nthe murder of William Holyoak, and Mr. Gilbert Robertson appeared in\r\nhis defence. Mr. Robertson urged that the murders committed by Musquito\r\nwere in self defence. Had he been protected by the Government, as he\r\nshould have been after the services he had rendered, he would never\r\nhave taken to the bush. He related many instances to show the skill of\r\nthe black, and among others, said that he had seen him \"cut the head\r\noff a flying pigeon with a crooked stick.\"[20] This seems to indicate\r\nthat however intimately Mr. Robertson might be acquainted with the Van\r\nDiemen's Land blacks he had no acquaintance with the boomerang. In\r\nspite of the conciliator's efforts Musquito was convicted and sentenced\r\nto death. When the sentence had been pronounced Musquito said, \"Hanging\r\nno---- good for blackfellow.\" Mr. Bisdee asked him \"Why not as good for\r\nblackfellow as for whitefellow?\" \"Oh,\" exclaimed Musquito, \"Very good\r\nfor whitefellow. He used to it.\" Black Jack was convicted of the murder\r\nof Patrick Macartney. The only English known by Black Jack was of the\r\n\"old hands oaths brand.\" The two blacks were hung in Hobart Town, but\r\n\"The Black War\" continued.\r\n\r\n\"The deadly antipathy which was excited between the aborigines and\r\nthe bushrangers of Van Diemen's Land provoked a series of outrages\r\nwhich would have terminated in the utter extinction of the whole race,\r\nif the local Government had not interposed to remove the last remnant\r\nof them from the island; an act of real mercy, though of apparent\r\nseverity.\"[21] Before proceeding to describe this attempt to save the\r\nremnant of the race we may perhaps give a list of the \"Atrocities\r\ncommitted by the blacks.\" It is not a very long one, taking into\r\nconsideration the time occupied in the war. In March, 1820, forty-nine\r\nnatives attacked Mr. Broadribb's house. They were divided into several\r\nparties which came up from different points simultaneously. One man was\r\nspeared in the thigh before the blacks were repulsed. They all went\r\naway together and stripped Mr. Thomson's house of everything portable.\r\nThey then proceeded to Mr. E. Denovan's and robbed his place. On April\r\n1st John Raynor was speared and dreadfully beaten at Spring Bay. On\r\nMay 18th a party of blacks attacked two men employed by Mr. Lord. One\r\nwas dangerously speared and the other beaten. The hut was stripped.\r\nOn June 1st Mr. Sherwin's hut, at Weasel Plain, was plundered, and on\r\nthe 15th, Den Hut, at Lake River, was stripped bare, and Mary Daniels\r\nand her two children murdered. On August 7th, S. Stockman's hut, at\r\nGreen Ponds, was plundered. On the 9th, some muskets, powder, and shot\r\nwere stolen from the huts of Mr. Sharland, a Government surveyor. On\r\nthe same day the Government hut, between Borthwick and Blue Ash, was\r\nrobbed, several horses stolen from Mr. Wood and Mr. Pitcairn, and a man\r\nwounded at Mr. Purvis's. This party consisted of about forty blacks.\r\nThey were met by Mr. Howell's party, and the blacks were driven off\r\nafter a fight. A woman living near was wounded with a spear. On the\r\n23rd, the huts of Mr. J. Connell and Mr. Robertson were attacked, and\r\nthe latter plundered; Mr. Sutherland's shepherds were robbed of their\r\narms and one of them wounded; some arms were taken from Mr. Taylor's\r\nhut. The next day James Hooper was killed, and his hut plundered. The\r\nhuts of Lieutenants Bell and Watts were attacked, but the blacks were\r\nrepulsed. On September 8th Captain Clark's shepherd was attacked, but\r\ncontrived to escape. On the 13th one man was killed and another wounded\r\non the banks of the Tamar River. On the 14th a man working at the\r\nGovernment lime kilns at Bothwell was attacked, but escaped. On the\r\n18th a private of the 63rd Regiment was speared and two other soldiers\r\nwounded. One of the savages was killed. On the 27th Francis Booker was\r\nkilled with spears, and on the next day three men at Major Gray's hut\r\nwere wounded. On the same day two men were killed at Mr. G. Scott's\r\nplace and their bodies thrown into the river. A third man was wounded,\r\nbut escaped into the bush. The house was stripped of everything. This\r\nrobbery was so systematically carried through that it was believed that\r\nthe blacks had been led by white men. A hut on the opposite side of\r\nthe road was also stripped. On October 16th the settlement at Sorell\r\nwas attacked, one man being killed and another severely wounded. Four\r\nhouses were stripped. On the 18th Captain Stewart's shepherd was killed\r\nand a settler, Mr. Gilders, was also speared and died. On the 19th,\r\nMessrs. Gatehouse and Gordon's house was attacked, but the blacks were\r\nrepulsed. They were also driven away from Mr. Gaugel's place, but not\r\nbefore he was severely wounded. On November 19th two huts were robbed\r\non the Ouse River. Captain Wight's shepherd was killed and dreadfully\r\nmangled. His body was found later. On the 27th a hut on the Esk River\r\nwas stripped bare. On February 3rd, 1821, an attack was made on Mr.\r\nBurrell's house on the Tamar River. Mr. Wallace was severely wounded in\r\nseveral places, and a child was also wounded by a spear. L. Knight's\r\nhut was plundered, three horses belonging to Mr. Sutherland were killed\r\nand three others were wounded. His hut at North Esk was also plundered.\r\nMrs. McCaskell was killed near Westbury, and her hut plundered of\r\neverything. An attack made on Mr. Stewart's house was repulsed. On\r\nMarch 8th, two sawyers were wounded, and two huts near New Norfolk were\r\nplundered. On the 12th, Mrs. Cunningham and her child were severely\r\nwounded, and her hut at East Arm plundered. Mr. Lawrence's servant\r\nwas wounded, and three men were wounded on Norfolk Plains. On April\r\n5th, T. Ralton was killed with a spear while splitting wood. On the\r\n16th, Mr. Fitzgerald was sitting at the door of his hut reading, when\r\na blackfellow sneaked up and drove a spear through him, after which\r\nhis cottage was plundered. On the 17th, another attack was made on\r\nFitzgerald's house. On May 10th, the Government store at Patrick Plains\r\nwas burned down. Mr. Kemp's establishment at Lake Sorell was attacked\r\nby a large mob of blacks. Two men were killed, one wounded, the\r\nbuildings were burned down and the firearms carried away. On June 6th,\r\nseveral huts were attacked at Hunter's Hill. Mrs. Triffet was speared\r\nand her house plundered, the huts of Messrs. Marnetti, Bell, and Clark\r\nwere robbed, and Mrs. N. Long was killed. On September 5th, Thomas\r\nSmith was killed at Tapsley, and his hut plundered; John Higginson\r\nwas killed and his hut robbed, and a sawyer's hut was plundered. On\r\nthe 7th, Mr. B.B. Thomas and his overseer, Mr. Parker, were murdered\r\nnear Port Sorell, while endeavouring to carry out the conciliatory\r\npolicy of the Government. Mr. Stocker's hut was attacked, a man named\r\nCupid killed, and a child wounded. On the 27th, Mr. Dawson's hut on\r\nBushy Plains was attacked, and a man severely beaten. On the 23rd, Mr.\r\nDawson's man Hughes was again beaten with waddies and nearly killed. On\r\nOctober 13th, the natives, armed with muskets, attacked and robbed the\r\nhouse of Constable Reid, and afterwards that of Mr. Amos Junior.[22]\r\n\r\nThis report covers only a portion of the time during which the war\r\nlasted, but it sufficiently indicates the character of the war. When\r\nthe blacks attacked the cottages, or huts as they are called in\r\nAustralia, of shepherds, sawyers, splitters, and other workers, they\r\nwere frequently successful, but were generally repulsed when they\r\nattacked the residences or houses of the employers. The manner in\r\nwhich the blacks fought struck terror into the hearts of the settlers.\r\nNo one was safe. At any time, day or night, a party of blacks might\r\nsneak up and, with wild yells, spear men, women, and children, old or\r\nyoung, without warning. Their patience in tracking was indomitable.\r\nIf they could not effect a surprise they withdrew and waited. No\r\ndoubt, as the advocates of the cause of the blacks said, the number of\r\nwhites killed was much smaller than the number of blacks slaughtered\r\nby bushrangers in their lust and by settlers and soldiers in defence.\r\nBut it can be readily understood that the position of the settlers was\r\nintolerable. Every attempt to drive the blacks away from the settled\r\ndistricts only provoked fresh reprisals, while every attempt at\r\nconciliation failed until at length it became evident that the blacks\r\nmust be either captured or killed. It was therefore with a view to\r\nsaving the blacks that Lieutenant Governor Arthur urged the necessity\r\nof capturing and removing them from Van Diemen's Land to one of the\r\nIslands in Bass's Straits. In his despatches to Governor Bourke and to\r\nthe Colonial Office, he said that it was utterly impossible to restrain\r\nthe colonists, so great was their rage at the murders of peaceful\r\ncitizens, and especially of women and children, while all his attempts\r\nat conciliation had failed in consequence of the continual outrages\r\ncommitted on the blacks by the bushrangers. Mr. Gilbert Robertson said:\r\n\"One day a settler was riding across his grounds looking for cattle.\r\nHe jumped his horse over a log, and while doing so caught the sparkle\r\nof a pair of eyes gleaming from the shadow of the log. He pulled\r\nup, wheeled his horse round and dismounted, thinking he had found a\r\nkangaroo, but on pulling some brush away saw a poor cowering black\r\ntrying to hide himself, but there was no mercy in the heart of the\r\nsettler. He cocked his gun and shot the black in cold blood.\"[23] The\r\nstory is a very pathetic one, but perhaps the settler had had reason to\r\nknow that \"the poor cowering black\" was sneaking up to the settlement\r\nto murder any unsuspecting man, woman, or child he might come across.\r\nHiding behind logs, crawling through brush, was the ordinary method of\r\nfighting employed by the Van Diemen's Land aborigines, and had he not\r\nbeen on the war path he would not have resorted to this secret manner\r\nof travelling but would have stood out boldly. The blacks are not\r\ncowards, and are not afraid of showing themselves, as a rule, after\r\ntheir first superstitious fear of the white man passes away. This being\r\nthe general experience of bushmen, the settler may have been justified\r\nin killing the black. He may have been simply treating him according to\r\nthe blackfellow's own rule in war time. But although we may acquit the\r\nsettler of blame by such reasoning, the existence of such conditions\r\nas to necessitate such a war is not the less deplorable. The whites\r\nall carried arms when travelling, and even while working about their\r\nhomes. Shepherds and other workmen went in pairs. There was no safety\r\nanywhere outside the cleared lands round the larger towns. Reviewing\r\nthe whole situation from our present standpoint, it is difficult to say\r\nwhat other measures could have been adopted than those tried by the\r\nGovernment. The authorities were apparently incapable of controlling\r\nthe bushrangers, nor could they prevent convicts from running away,\r\nand these outlaws appear to have always considered the blacks as\r\nfair game. Mr. Robertson tells us that a convict known as \"Carrots\"\r\nboasted shortly before his death that, \"having killed a native in his\r\nattempt to carry off the black's wife, he cut off the dead man's head\r\nand obliged the woman to go with him carrying it suspended round her\r\nneck.\"[24] Is it any wonder that even such \"passive and inoffensive\r\ncreatures\" as the Van Diemen's Land blacks are said to have been,\r\nshould have been aroused to fury by such methods? But although the\r\nGovernment had no control over the convicts in the bush, and such\r\noutrages as this were not known of until long after they had occurred,\r\nit can scarcely be said that even Governor Arthur, in spite of his\r\nearnest desire to protect the blacks, was altogether blameless. The\r\nwhole policy of the Government in relation to the blacks was weak and\r\nvacillating. Governor Arthur promised a native, known as Teague, a boat\r\non condition that he should assist in the capture of some bushrangers.\r\nThe black performed his share of the work, but he never got his boat,\r\nand is said to have fretted himself to death in consequence. The Sydney\r\nblack, Musquito, was forced \"into the bush\" by the failure of the\r\nGovernment to protect him against the persecution due to the manner\r\nin which he had been employed in the service of that Government. In\r\nSeptember, 1826, two blacks were hung in Hobart Town \"to impress the\r\nothers.\" Nothing could be more absurd than this, and it was far more\r\nbarbarous a method of reprisal than the shooting of a \"poor cowering\r\nblack.\" But the Government was not even consistent in its savagery.\r\nAt the trial of Eumarrah Mr. Robertson pleaded that the black was\r\njustified in resisting the invaders of his country in any and every\r\nway; and, on his undertaking to remove Eumarrah to Flinders Island,\r\nwhere he had collected about thirty-eight blacks under the charge of\r\nmissionaries, the plea was accepted and the prisoner was handed over to\r\nhim. By this time, however, the war had become so vindictive that even\r\nthe authorities in London recognised that the blacks must be captured\r\nor annihilated, and consequently permission was granted to Governor\r\nArthur to put in practice the most extraordinary project perhaps ever\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1828, a proclamation was issued which, after describing the\r\nstate of tension which existed between whites and blacks, exhorted\r\nall well-disposed persons to assist the Government in attempting to\r\nestablish peace and order. The proclamation went on to explain that a\r\ncordon was to be drawn round the disturbed area and that this was to be\r\ngradually contracted until the natives were either captured or driven\r\nacross the narrow isthmus which connects Tasman's peninsula with the\r\nmain portion of the island. \"But I do, nevertheless, hereby strictly\r\norder, enjoin, and command, that the actual use of arms be in no case\r\nresorted to, by firing against any of the natives, or otherwise, if\r\nthey can by other measures be captured.\"\r\n\r\nThe force employed in this gigantic scheme is said to have been about\r\ntwo thousand two hundred men, of whom five hundred and fifty were\r\nsoldiers belonging to the 63rd, the 57th, and the 17th regiments. The\r\nwhole force was divided into parties of about ten each, and one of\r\nthese was appointed a leader. On October 7th, a chain of posts was\r\nestablished from St. Patrick's Head along the rivers St. Paul, South\r\nEsk, Macquarie, and Meander, under the command of Major Douglas, of\r\nthe 63rd regiment. A similar chain of posts was formed from the Derwent\r\nRiver along the River Dee to the Lakes, under Captain Wentworth, of\r\nthe 63rd regiment. A third party, under Captain Donaldson, of the 57th\r\nregiment, was stationed in the rear to capture any blacks who might\r\nescape through the front line. Captain Moriarty, R.N., in charge of\r\na party, was appointed to scour between the lines and to drive the\r\nnatives forward or capture them. Mr. Gilbert Robertson and other\r\nfriends of the blacks acted with this group of parties with the object\r\nof persuading such natives as they might meet to surrender quietly.\r\nFor about three weeks the posts were advanced slowly, and frequent\r\nreports were circulated that the beaters had seen parties of blacks\r\nand that they were going in the desired direction. On the 25th Mr.\r\nWalpole reported that he had come on a camp of blacks and saw them\r\nlighting their fires and cooking as if nothing unusual was going on.\r\nHe watched all night, and just before daybreak crept up slowly and\r\nfound five blacks asleep. He seized one and held him after a desperate\r\nstruggle, during which the black bit him severely on the arm. A boy\r\nof about fifteen was captured by another settler who was with Mr.\r\nWalpole, and these two were handed over to the authorities and conveyed\r\nto the nearest police station to be kept until the remainder were\r\ncaptured. On the 26th Lieutenant Ovens saw a black with a firestick\r\napparently trying to sneak through the lines. He ran forward and the\r\nblack retreated into the bush. Several other blacks were turned back\r\nfrom other points in the line. These also carried firesticks. On the\r\n27th the cordon had been drawn so close that the escape of the blacks\r\nwithin the line was considered impossible, but as no reports had been\r\nmade for some time of any blacks having been seen, some discontent was\r\nmanifested by the hunters. On the 31st an order was issued from the\r\ncamp at Sorrell rivulet to close in, and hopes were expressed that no\r\nblacks would be permitted to escape in the final rush. The following\r\nday the lines closed in, and no blacks escaped. There was none there\r\nto escape. They had slipped through the lines as soon as they became\r\naware that they were being hunted, and the man and boy caught by Mr.\r\nWalpole's party were the only blacks captured. A proclamation was\r\npublished next day, in which the Governor thanked the settlers for\r\ntheir services, and regretted that their efforts had not been more\r\nsuccessful. In a despatch sent to the Colonial Secretary, Governor\r\nArthur said, \"I regret to report that the measures which I had the\r\nhonour to lay before you terminated without the capture of either\r\nof the native tribes,\"[25] and that was all that was said about it\r\nofficially. It has been estimated that the scheme cost the colony some\r\n£35,000, but no particulars were published, and therefore all estimates\r\nof cost are mere guesses.\r\n\r\nFrom a humanitarian point of view it is to be regretted that it did\r\nnot succeed, but the fact that it could be attempted proves how little\r\nwas known of the blacks by the authorities. The fact that the blacks,\r\nwho were said to be endeavouring to escape through the lines, held\r\nfiresticks in their hands proves that they were then unaware of the\r\nintention of the whites, and they were probably outside the lines very\r\nshortly after it had been thus intimated to them that they were being\r\nhunted. But it is doubtful whether the race could have been preserved\r\nif they had been removed in large numbers from Van Diemen's Land. Mr.\r\nGilbert Robertson and his successor, Mr. G.A. Robinson, succeeded in\r\nremoving about 130 blacks to Flinders Island, where, although they were\r\nunder the care of missionaries, they gradually died off. It was not\r\nrecognised in those days that compelling the blacks to wear clothes\r\ninduces skin diseases which soon prove fatal. The only way to preserve\r\nthe Australian blacks is to leave them alone, and the knowledge of this\r\nfact came too late to save the Tasmanians.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: History of Van Diemen's Land from 1820 to 1835.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Commission of Enquiry into the state of the Colony of New\r\nSouth Wales, 1822-3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Despatch dated April 17th, 1828.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Hobart Town Gazette._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons,\r\n1838.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons,\r\n1838.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Despatch from Governor Arthur to Earl Bathurst, dated\r\nOctober 13, 1831.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons,\r\n1838.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons,\r\n1838.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Despatch dated June 27th, 1835.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  Pierce the Cannibal; A Terrible Journey; A Shocking Confession;\r\n  Escapes from \"the Western Hell\"; The Ruffian Jefferies; Brady the\r\n  Bushranger; Escapes from Macquarie Harbour; Sticks up the Town of\r\n  Sorell; The Governor's Proclamation; Brady Laughs at it; The Fight\r\n  with Colonel Balfour; Betrayed by a Comrade; Captured by John Batman;\r\n  Sympathy at his Trial; End of the Epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a despatch to the Colonial Secretary in 1822, Lieutenant Governor\r\nArthur said that bushranging had been \"totally suppressed in Van\r\nDiemen's Land during the past three years,\" or since the breaking up\r\nof Howe's gang. But the happy conditions suggested by this report\r\nwere not destined to last. There was still a number of runaways or\r\nbolters in the bush, but bushranging had by this time come to mean the\r\ncommission of more serious crimes than petty larceny, and it was in\r\nthis sense that the Governor made use of the term. We have, however,\r\nnot yet arrived at the time when others, besides highwaymen, can be\r\nexcluded. The next illustration is, perhaps, the most terrible of all\r\nthe events connected with bushranging, although it concerns only the\r\nbushrangers themselves. On September 20th, 1822, Alexander Pierce, Bob\r\nGreenhill, Mathew Travers, Thomas Bodenham, Bill Cornelius or Kenelly,\r\nJames Brown, John Mathers, and Alexander Dalton made their escape from\r\nthe recently-founded penal station at Macquarie Harbour. According to\r\nPierce's confession it appears that they \"made it up for to take a\r\nboat\" and proceed to Hobart Town. Greenhill being at work at the mines,\r\n\"we had to call for him, he being a good navigator.\" Greenhill smashed\r\nup the miners' chests with an axe, and took all their provisions. \"We\r\nthen put out all the fires with buckets of water, so that the miners\r\ncould not signal our escape; but, when we were a quarter of a mile\r\nout we saw fires all along the beach, so we could not have put them\r\nall out. We thought a boat would be despatched after us, so we went a\r\nlittle further and then landed. We knew it was no use trying to go by\r\nwater, so we broke up the boat. We then proceeded to the side of the\r\nmountain right opposite the settlement. We were afraid that Dr. Spence\r\nor the Commandant would see us with the spy glass, the settlement being\r\nso plain to us. So we agreed to lie down until the sun went round. When\r\nthe sun was behind the hill we went to the top, kindled a fire, and\r\ncamped all night. Next morning we started again, and walked all day.\r\nLittle Brown, who came back, and died in the hospital, was the worst\r\nwalker of all. He was always behind, and kept cooeying. So we said we\r\nwould leave him behind if he did not keep up. We kept off Gordon River\r\nfor fear the soldiers might be after us. We travelled from daylight\r\ntill dark night over very rough country for eight days. We were very\r\nweak for want of provisions. Our tinder got wet and we were very cold\r\nand hungry. Bill Cornelius said 'I'm so hungry I could eat a piece\r\nof a man.' The next morning there were four of us for a feast. Bob\r\nGreenhill said he had 'seen the like done before and it eat much like\r\npork.' Mathers spoke out and said it would be murder; and perhaps then\r\nwe could not eat it. 'I'll warrant you,' said Greenhill, 'I'll eat the\r\nfirst bit; but, you must all lend a hand, so that we'll all be equal\r\nin the crime.' We consulted about who should fall, and Greenhill said,\r\n'Dalton, he volunteered to be a flogger. We will kill him.' We made a\r\nbit of a breakwind with boughs, and about three in the morning Dalton\r\nwas asleep. Then Greenhill struck him on the head with an axe and he\r\nnever spoke after. Greenhill called Travers, and he cut Dalton's throat\r\nto bleed him. Then we dragged him away a bit and cut him up. Travers\r\nand Greenhill put his heart and liver on the fire and ate them before\r\nthey were right warm. The others refused to eat any that night, but the\r\nnext morning it was cut up and divided and we all got our share. We\r\nstarted a little after sunrise. One man was appointed each day to walk\r\nahead and make a road. He carried nothing but a tomahawk. The others\r\ncarried the things. This morning Cornelius and Brown said they would go\r\nahead together and carry the pots. We had not gone far when the leaders\r\nwere missing. We went back to look for them, but could see no signs of\r\nthem. We said, 'They will go back and hang us all,' but we thought they\r\nwould not find the way, so we went on. We walked for four days through\r\nbad country, till we came to a big river. We thought it was the Gordon.\r\nWe stopped a day and two nights looking for a place to cross. We felled\r\ntrees, but the stream was too strong and carried them away. Travers\r\nand Bodenham couldn't swim, but at last we got over and cut a pole\r\nthirty or forty feet long and reached it across, where there was a rock\r\njutting out into the river, and pulled them across. We got up the hill\r\nwith great difficulty, it was so steep. The ground was very barren on\r\nthe other side, and covered with scrub. We were very weak and hungry.\r\nA consultation was held as to who should be the next victim. Bodenham\r\ndid not know anything about it, and it was resolved to kill him. Me and\r\nMathers went to gather wood, Travers saying, 'You'll hear it directly.'\r\nAbout two minutes after Mathers said, 'He's done; Greenhill hit him\r\nwith the axe and Travers cut his throat.' Greenhill took Bodenham's\r\nshoes and put them on, for his own were very bad. We ate only the\r\nheart and liver that night. Next day we camped and dried the meat. We\r\ntravelled on for three days, and saw many emus and kangaroos, but could\r\nnot catch them. Mathers and me went away together, and Mathers said,\r\n'Let us go on by ourselves. You see what kind of a cove Greenhill is.\r\nHe'd kill his own father before he'd fast for a day.' We travelled on\r\nfor two days more. We boiled a piece of the meat, and it made Mathers\r\nso sick that he began to vomit. Greenhill started up and hit him on\r\nthe forehead with the axe. Although he was cut, he was still stronger\r\nthan Greenhill. He called out, 'Pierce, will you see me murdered?'\r\nand rushed at Greenhill. He took the axe from him and threw it to\r\nme. We walked on till night, and then Travers and Greenhill collared\r\nMathers and got him down. They gave him half an hour to pray. When the\r\nhalf-hour was up Mathers handed the prayer-book to me and Greenhill\r\nkilled him. When crossing the second tier of mountains Travers got his\r\nfoot stung by an insect and it swelled up. On the other side we got to\r\na big river and camped for two nights. Me and Greenhill swam across\r\nand cut a long wattle, and pulled Travers over as he could not swim.\r\nHere the country got better and we travelled well for two days. Then\r\nTravers' foot got black, and he said he couldn't go any further. He\r\nasked us to leave him to die in peace. When we were a little way away,\r\nGreenhill said: 'Pierce, it's no use for to be detained any longer;\r\nlet's serve him like the rest.' I replied, 'I'll have no hand in it.'\r\nWhen we went back Travers was lying on his back asleep. It was about\r\ntwo o'clock in the day. Greenhill lifted the axe and hit him on the\r\nhead, and then cut his throat. We crossed the third tier of mountains\r\nand got into fine country, the grass being very long. Greenhill began\r\nto fret, and said he would never reach a post. I watched Greenhill\r\nfor two nights and thought that he eyed me more than usual. He always\r\ncarried the axe and kept it under his head when lying down. At length,\r\njust before daybreak, Greenhill dozed off to sleep, and I snatched\r\nthe axe and killed him with a blow. I took a thigh and one arm and\r\ntravelled on four more days until the last was eaten. I then walked for\r\ntwo days with nothing to eat I took off my belt meaning to hang myself,\r\nbut took another turn and travelled on till I came to a fire with some\r\npieces of kangaroo and opossum lying beside it. I ate as much as I\r\ncould and carried the rest away. Some days later I came to a marsh. I\r\nsaw a duck with ten young ones. I jumped into the water and the duck\r\nflew off, while the little ones dived. Two of them came up close to my\r\nlegs and I caught one in each hand. Next day I saw a large mountain,\r\nand thought it was Table Mountain. Then I came to a big river and\r\ntravelled down it for two days. I came on a flock of sheep belonging\r\nto Tom Triffet, at the falls, and caught a lamb. While I was eating it\r\nthe shepherd came up and said he would tell. I threatened to shoot him.\r\nThen he got friendly and took me to the hut, and fed me for three days.\r\nThen he told me that the master was coming up and I'd have to go. I\r\nwent to another hut and stayed three weeks. Then I fell in with Davis\r\nand Cheetham and they said I could join them. They had 126 newly-marked\r\nsheep and said they were going to select some more. I shepherded the\r\nmob while they were away. They continued robbing the stations until the\r\nsoldiers came. The soldiers captured the gang except Bill Davis, who\r\nsnatched up his gun and ran away, Corporal Kelly followed and called on\r\nhim to stop. As he kept on Kelly fired and missed, when Davis turned\r\nround and said, 'I've got you now.' Kelly cried out 'Murder,' and the\r\nother soldiers ran forward and fired. Davis was wounded in the arm and\r\ngave in.\"\r\n\r\nThe confession may here be very much abridged, as the account he gives\r\nof his acts is very rambling. About 250 sheep, a gold watch, two\r\nsilver watches, and a number of other articles were found at the camp.\r\nSeveral of the gang were hung and the others sentenced to long terms\r\nof penal servitude. Pierce denied having taken any active share in\r\nthe robberies, and as he was merely found in charge of the stolen, or\r\nas he euphoniously calls them \"the selected,\" sheep, he was sent back\r\nto Macquarie Harbour to be dealt with as a bolter. On November 16th,\r\n1823, Pierce again absconded from Macquarie Harbour in company with\r\nThomas Cox. On the 21st, as the schooner _Waterloo_ was sailing down\r\nthe harbour, a man was observed standing on the shore and signalling\r\nwith smoke from a fire. These signals had also been observed from the\r\nsettlement, and a boat was despatched from there. The boat sent by\r\nMr. Lucas from the schooner reached the place at the same time that\r\nthe boat from the settlement arrived. On landing it was found that\r\nAlexander Pierce had made the fire, and he was immediately arrested by\r\nLieutenant Cuthertson. Pierce said that he had killed Cox and eaten\r\npart of the body. He volunteered to show where the remainder was. On\r\ngoing to the place it was found that all the fleshy parts had been\r\ncut away, leaving the bones and viscera. It is impossible that Pierce\r\ncould have committed this murder through want of food. He had only been\r\naway from the settlement for a few days, and some flour, a piece of\r\npork, some bread, and a few fish, which Pierce and Cox had stolen from\r\na party of hunters, were found at the camp. Before his trial Pierce\r\nsaid that he had been so horror-struck at the crime he had committed\r\nthat, when he signalled, he did not know what he was about. After\r\nhis conviction, however, he said that man's flesh was delicious; far\r\nbetter than fish or pork; and his craving for it had led him to induce\r\nCox to abscond so that he might kill and eat him. He was wearing the\r\nclothes of the murdered man when he was captured. Although he made no\r\nsecret of his cannibalism after his conviction, but boasted about it,\r\nhe is believed to have very much toned down his share in the murders\r\nperpetrated during that terrible journey across the Western Tiers.\r\nPossibly Greenhill may have been the moving spirit in these atrocities,\r\nbut we have the fact that Pierce was the sole survivor, and he gives\r\nbut a very brief account of the last struggle between himself and\r\nGreenhill. We can conceive something of it. Pierce was the larger and\r\nstronger man, but Greenhill was active though small, and moreover he\r\ncarried the axe. The two men probably pretended to be actuated by\r\nfriendly feelings towards each other; each one endeavouring to put the\r\nother off his guard; but each knew that the other was only watching for\r\nan opportunity to slay him. For two days they walked side by side at a\r\nsafe distance apart; each afraid to let the other get behind him, or\r\nnear enough to spring upon him; and each was also afraid to allow the\r\nother to get out of sight because of the certainty that he would merely\r\ndog him through the scrub until an opportunity to strike occurred. For\r\ntwo nights they sat facing each other, a short distance apart, each\r\nafraid to go to sleep or to allow the other to go out of sight. If\r\none rose up the other started to his feet immediately. Every slight\r\nmovement of one caused the other to be on the alert. The tension must\r\nhave been fearful. At length, when the second night was drawing to a\r\nclose, Greenhill could bear up no longer. He dozed, and Pierce sprang\r\non him at once. That is something like the tradition handed down among\r\nthe \"old hands,\" who knew nothing of Pierce's confession, but who had\r\nheard the tale from companions of the cannibal himself. There was a\r\ntime when it was frequently told round the camp fire in rough, coarse\r\nlanguage, plentifully intermingled with profanity, but the old hands\r\nhave died out and it is heard no longer. Pierce, the cannibal, has\r\nbeen almost forgotten, and yet the story has its moral. It affords\r\nus an example of the terrible depths of degradation to which men can\r\nbe reduced by brutal treatment, and it is not good that the story of\r\nAlexander Pierce should be forgotten as long as any remains of the old\r\nprison discipline which produced such men continues to exist, either in\r\nAustralia or in any other civilised country.\r\n\r\nThe settlement at Macquarie Harbour, \"the Western Hell,\" as the\r\nconvicts called it, was opened as a penal station on January the 3rd,\r\n1822, and from that time until its removal to Port Arthur in May, 1827,\r\none hundred and twelve prisoners ran away. Of these, seventy-four are\r\nreported to have \"perished in the woods.\" The remains of a number\r\nof men have been found at various times; but, as a rule, too late\r\nfor identification, and therefore the official records do not assert\r\npositively that these men did perish, but only that, as nothing had\r\nbeen seen or heard of them for long periods, and remains supposed to\r\nbe theirs had been found, it was reasonable to assume that they had\r\nperished. Two returned, as related by Pierce, namely Bill Cornelius or\r\nKenelly and James Brown. On both these men portions of the murdered\r\nman Dalton were found, and Cornelius was punished as a bolter. Brown,\r\nhowever, was too ill, and was admitted to the hospital, where he died.\r\nEight of the hundred and twelve runaways from Macquarie Harbour are\r\nreported to have reached Port Dalrymple or some other settlement, but\r\nin each case the official report bears the significant note, \"wants\r\nconfirmation.\" Five men were eaten as related. Three were picked up\r\nin a wretched condition on the beach by the steamer _Waterloo_, three\r\nothers of the same gang being included among those who perished. Two\r\nwere shot; two found dead. This leaves sixteen, and these are known to\r\nhave reached the settled districts. Of these, Pierce was one. Every\r\nprecaution was taken at Macquarie Harbour to prevent bolting. A line\r\nof posts was established across the neck of land between Pirates' Bay\r\nand Storm Bay, and fierce dogs were chained at these places to give\r\nnotice when any one passed or approached. This use of dogs gave rise\r\nto a report in England that bloodhounds were used in Van Diemen's Land\r\nto track runaway convicts or bushrangers. This, however, was shown\r\nnot to be true. The dogs were used as watch dogs and not as hunting or\r\ntracking dogs.[26]\r\n\r\nThree other men who ran away from Macquarie Harbour were Jefferies,\r\nHopkins, and Russell. Like Pierce and his mates they started to cross\r\nthe Western Tiers. They lived fairly well for several days, Jefferies\r\nhaving a gun and ammunition which he had stolen, it is supposed, from\r\na soldier, but at length their provisions failed and they could find\r\nno game. They therefore agreed to toss up to decide who should die to\r\nsave the others. Russell lost and was immediately shot by Jefferies.\r\nThe two men lived on the flesh for five days, when they came to a\r\nsheep station. They immediately threw away about five pounds weight of\r\nRussell's flesh and killed two sheep. The shepherd ran forward at the\r\nsound of the shots, when Jefferies told him that if he interfered he\r\nwould \"soon be settled.\" They only wanted \"a good feed.\" Jefferies and\r\nHopkins appear to have adopted bushranging as a profession. Of Hopkins\r\nwe hear little, but Jefferies established a character for brutality\r\nwhich has been rivalled by few and surpassed by none. When he bailed up\r\nMr. Tibbs's house he ordered Mr. and Mrs. Tibbs and their stockman to\r\ngo into the bushes with him. The stockman refused and was immediately\r\nshot. The other two then went across the cleared paddock towards the\r\ntimbered country, Mrs. Tibbs carrying her baby and Jefferies walking\r\nbehind. When near the edge of the timber Jefferies ordered Mrs. Tibbs\r\nto walk faster. The poor woman was weeping bitterly. She sobbed out\r\nthat she was walking as fast as she could with the baby in her arms.\r\nJefferies immediately snatched the baby from her and dashed its brains\r\nout against a sapling. Then he asked her \"Can you go faster now?\" Mr.\r\nTibbs turned round and rushed at the bushranger, who shot him, and then\r\nwalked away, leaving Mrs. Tibbs with her dead and dying. At Georgetown\r\nJefferies stuck up and robbed Mr. Baker and then compelled him to carry\r\nhis knapsack. They had not, however, walked far along the road when\r\nJefferies, who was behind, shot Mr. Baker without warning and for no\r\napparent cause. Jefferies was captured by John Batman, a native of\r\nParramatta, New South Wales, and afterwards one of the founders of\r\nthe city of Melbourne, Victoria. Batman had taken several Australian\r\naborigines to Van Diemen's Land and was engaged by the Government to\r\ntrack and capture bushrangers. He caught Hopkins and several others.\r\nA man named Broughton, who had been captured a short time before,\r\nwas convicted of murder and cannibalism shortly before Jefferies and\r\nHopkins were brought to trial.\r\n\r\nIt is quite a relief to turn from these monsters in human form to\r\nMathew Brady, the central figure among the bushrangers of this epoch.\r\nBrady was a gentleman convict: that is, he was an educated man. He was\r\ntransported to \"Botany Bay\" for forgery, the capital sentence having\r\nbeen commuted. In Sydney he soon \"got into trouble\" for insubordination\r\nand was retransported to Van Diemen's Land. He was one of a gang\r\nof fourteen who effected their escape from Macquarie Harbour. His\r\ncompanions in this enterprise were James Bryant, John Burns, James\r\nCrawford, James McCabe, Patrick Connolly, John Griffiths, George Lacey,\r\nCharles Rider, Jeremiah Ryan, John Thompson, Isaac Walker, and John\r\nDownes. They stole a whale boat on June 7th, 1824, and pulled round the\r\ncoast until they came to a favourable place for landing, from whence\r\nthey walked to the settled districts. Here they were joined by James\r\nTierney, and for some two years they defied the authorities. In company\r\nwith the \"notorious Dunne,\" Brady stuck up Mr. Robert Bethune's house\r\nnear Hobart Town when the males of the family were away. In the evening\r\nMr. Walter Bethune and Captain Bannister returned from the city on\r\nhorseback, and Brady went out to meet them. He told the two gentlemen\r\nthat they were prisoners and that resistance was useless. They were\r\ntaken by surprise, and unarmed, and surrendered at once. Brady called\r\none of his men to \"take the gentlemen's horses to the stables and see\r\nthat they were cared for,\" and then conducted the gentlemen into the\r\nparlour as if he were the host and they merely visitors. The ladies of\r\nthe family and the servants, except the cook, were already gathered\r\nthere, and Brady ordered dinner and invited those present to take their\r\nseats at the table. He himself sat down, while his companions had food\r\ntaken to them at the stations where he had placed them on guard. When\r\nthe meal was over Brady made a collection of watches, rings, money,\r\nand other valuables, and then, after profusely thanking Mr. Bethune\r\nfor his hospitable treatment and the kind reception he had given them,\r\nthe whole gang mounted and rode away. On the following evening he rode\r\ninto the little town of Sorell. The soldiers stationed there had been\r\nout kangarooing, and were cleaning their muskets. Taken completely by\r\nsurprise, they were easily overpowered, and were locked up in the gaol,\r\nthe prisoners being released. Mr. Long, the gaoler, contrived to make\r\nhis escape, and ran to the residence of Dr. Garrett. Here he found\r\nLieutenant Green, who was in command of the military stationed at the\r\ntown. The doctor and the lieutenant walked together to the gaol, and\r\nthe doctor was seized by Brady's orders and placed in a cell. Green\r\nrefused to surrender, and was shot in the arm by one of the bushrangers\r\nand overcome. The bushrangers made a good haul from the houses in the\r\ntown, and then left quietly. The only personal injury inflicted was\r\nthe wound received by Lieutenant Green, who was forced to have his arm\r\namputated.\r\n\r\nOn August 27th, 1824, Governor Arthur issued a proclamation offering\r\nrewards for the capture of Brady, McCabe, Dunne, Murphy, and other\r\nbushrangers, and calling upon all Crown servants and respectable\r\ncitizens to aid the soldiers in their capture.\r\n\r\nBy way of reply, Brady and his gang paid a visit to Mr. Young's house\r\nat Lake River. It was late at night, but the bushrangers soon roused\r\nthe inmates up. After having secured the men, Brady enquired whether\r\nthere were any ladies inside, and on being told that there were he\r\nissued an order to them to get up and dress at once, and to go into any\r\nroom they pleased, pledging his word that they should not be interfered\r\nwith. While this was being done Brady sat on the verandah chatting with\r\nMr. Young. Among other things he spoke of the Governor's proclamation,\r\nand asked whether Mr. Young had seen it. He laughed heartily at the\r\nidea of the soldiers capturing him. While the chief was thus employed\r\nthe other members of the gang searched every room of the house, and\r\ncollected everything they thought worth taking. The ladies had all gone\r\ninto one room, and when the rest of the house had been searched they\r\nwere requested to leave that room and go into another.\r\n\r\nOne day Brady walked alone into a house close to the town and \"made\r\na swag\" of all that was valuable. He then called two of the convict\r\nservants and ordered them to take up the bundles and carry them for him\r\ninto the bush. He was obeyed because it was believed that his gang was\r\nnot far off, and the owner of the property saw it carried away without\r\nmaking an effort to preserve it. On another occasion Brady ordered an\r\nassigned servant to leave his master's house and join the band. The man\r\nrefused. Brady walked to the sideboard, filled a glass with rum, and\r\nasked the man whether he could drink that? The man said he never took\r\nstrong liquor. \"Well, you will this time,\" exclaimed Brady, pointing\r\nhis pistol at the servant's head. \"Now choose.\" The man took the glass\r\nand swallowed the rum. Brady laughed heartily as he staggered away.\r\nHowever, the next morning, the unfortunate man was found lying in the\r\nbush some distance from the house. His dog was lying beside him licking\r\nhis face. He was still drunk. His employer, who found him, tried to\r\nrouse him up, and after he had shaken and called for some minutes the\r\nman opened his eyes, called out \"Water, for God's sake, water!\" and\r\nrolled over dead. When Brady was informed some time after of the man's\r\ndeath, he said he was very sorry. He had made him drink the rum as a\r\njoke and without any thought or desire to injure him.\r\n\r\nBrady stuck up the Duke of York Inn, and finding Captain Smith\r\nthere, knocked him down, having mistaken him for Colonel Balfour. On\r\ndiscovering his mistake the bushranger apologised. He then threatened\r\nto shoot Captain White, but on Captain Smith saying that White had\r\na wife and family Brady told the two officers to go away. He \"hated\r\nsoldiers\" and did not know what he might do if they stayed.\r\n\r\nColonel Balfour, of the 49th regiment, with a strong party of soldiers,\r\nhad been beating the bush for some time in hopes of capturing Brady\r\nand his gang. A report spread abroad that the gang intended to break\r\nopen the Launceston gaol and torture and shoot Mr. Jefferies. The\r\nthreat was treated with derision, but about 10 a.m. a man came into the\r\ntown and said that the bushrangers had taken possession of Mr. Dry's\r\nplace, just outside the town. Colonel Balfour, with ten soldiers and\r\nsome volunteers, started out and a fierce fight took place. Ultimately\r\nthe bushrangers were driven off, but not before they had secured\r\nMr. Dry's horses. The soldiers followed, and the bushrangers fired\r\nfrom behind the trees. Suddenly a report spread that the attack on\r\nDry's place was a ruse to draw the soldiers from the town, and that\r\na party of bushrangers under Bird and Dunne had gone to attack the\r\ngaol. Colonel Balfour sent half his force back to protect the town.\r\nThe report was found to be partly true. The bushrangers had entered\r\nthe town and had robbed Mr. Wedge's house, but had not gone to the\r\ngaol. At Dr. Priest's house some shots were exchanged, and the doctor\r\nwas wounded in the knee, but the soldiers coming up at the time the\r\nbushrangers made off.\r\n\r\nThe following day the gang made an attack on the farms of the Messrs.\r\nWalker. They burned the wheat-stacks and barns belonging to Mr. Abraham\r\nWalker and also those of Mr. Commissary Walker. They had Mr. Dry's\r\ntwo carriage horses, which they had stolen the day before. Brady was\r\nwearing Colonel Balfour's cap, which had fallen off in the fight at\r\nLaunceston. On the next day they burned down the house of Mr. Massey at\r\nSouth Esk, having sent him a letter a day or two before informing him\r\nof their intention.\r\n\r\nTwo of the gang called on Thomas Renton, and shouted for him to come\r\nout. On his doing so, they charged him with having attempted to betray\r\nthem. Renton denied the charge. A wrangle took place, during which\r\none of the bushrangers shot Renton dead. It is highly improbable that\r\nBrady was aware of this outrage. He boasted loudly on every available\r\noccasion that he never killed a man intentionally, and he is known to\r\nhave quarrelled with members of his gang who were too ready with their\r\nfirearms. Thus he drove McCabe out of the gang on account of his\r\nbrutality, and McCabe was captured and hung shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe gang held almost complete control over the roads, and resistance\r\nwas very rarely offered when they ordered a man to \"bail up.\"[27] One\r\nof the customs established by the gang was to order their witnesses\r\nto remain where they were for half an hour, and the order was rarely\r\ndisobeyed. Any person who declined to promise to remain was simply tied\r\nto a tree and left for any chance passer-by to unloose. In by-roads,\r\nor in those cases where the prisoners were marched some distance off\r\nthe high road into the bush before being plundered, being tied up was\r\na very serious matter. Cases are known to have occurred in which men\r\nhave remained bound to a tree until they have died of starvation.\r\nFrom this time forward tying up the victims was a common practice\r\nwith bushrangers, though some like Brady accepted the promise of the\r\nvictims to remain where they were left for a certain time to allow the\r\nbushrangers time to get away.\r\n\r\nAt length about the middle of 1825 a convict named Cowan or Cohen\r\nwas permitted to escape from an iron gang with broken fetters on his\r\nlegs. He was found by some of the gang and was taken to a friendly\r\nblacksmith who knocked his irons off for him. He joined the gang and\r\nmore than once led them into conflicts with the soldiers out of which\r\nonly the skill and bravery of Brady delivered them. Cowan was no doubt\r\na clever man in his way; he completely hoodwinked Brady and his mates;\r\nhe fought bravely in their skirmishes with the troops and was always\r\neager in looting houses or other places attacked. He professed to rob\r\n\"on principle.\" He is said to have murdered the bushrangers Murphy and\r\nWilliams while they slept, but there is no proof of this. He betrayed\r\nthe camp to Lieutenant Williams of the 40th regiment, who was out\r\nwith a party of soldiers in search of bushrangers. A terrific fight\r\ntook place in which several were killed on each side; some of the\r\nbushrangers were captured while others escaped, but the gang was broken\r\nup. Cowan is said to have received a free pardon, several hundreds of\r\npounds reward, and a free passage home for his services.[28]\r\n\r\nBrady made his escape in the bush and was followed by Batman and his\r\nblack trackers. The bushranger had been wounded in the fight and could\r\nnot travel fast. Batman came up to him in the mountains and called on\r\nhim to surrender. \"Are you an officer?\" asked Brady, coolly cocking\r\nhis gun. \"I'm not a soldier,\" replied Batman, \"I'm John Batman. If\r\nyou raise that gun I'll shoot. There's no chance for you.\" \"You're\r\nright,\" replied Brady, \"my time's come. You're a brave man and I yield;\r\nbut, I'd never give in to a soldier.\" Brady was taken to the nearest\r\nlock-up, where, as it happened, Jefferies, the cannibal, had been\r\nlodged some days before, and much to Brady's disgust the two men were\r\nconveyed to Hobart Town in the same cart. Brady, however, refused to\r\nsit on the same side of the cart as Jefferies, and kept as far from him\r\nas possible during the journey.[29]\r\n\r\nThe trial of Mathew Brady excited great interest. He and his gang\r\nhad kept the country in a ferment for twenty-two months. Many of his\r\ncompanions had been shot or captured, but the leader had escaped.\r\nOne of his mates, James Crawford, who had escaped with him from\r\nMacquarie Harbour, but who had been shot by the soldiers some time\r\nbefore the break up of the gang, was said to have been a lieutenant in\r\nthe army.[30] Numerous stories were told to illustrate his reckless\r\nbravery, his skill in strategy, or some other trait of his character.\r\nOn the day of his trial a number of ladies were in the court, and when\r\nthe verdict of guilty was returned, and the judge put on the black cap,\r\nthey showed their sympathy by weeping so loudly that the judge had to\r\npause until order was restored, and sentence of death was pronounced\r\namid signs of sorrow by all present.[31]\r\n\r\nAt the same sessions Jefferies, Hopkins, Bryant, Tilly, McKenny, Brown,\r\nGregory, Hodgetts, and Perry were sentenced to death for bushranging,\r\ncattle, horse, and sheep stealing, and for murder. Some of these had\r\nbeen \"in the bush\" with Brady. The last of the batch was hung on\r\nApril 29th, 1826, the prisoners being hung two or three at a time at\r\nintervals of a few days.\r\n\r\nThe remnant of the gang under the command of Dunne continued for a time\r\nto commit depredations. In one of their journeys they saw a tribe of\r\nblacks camped on the other side of the river. Dunne swam across and\r\nattacked them. He fought them for some time driving them back until he\r\nseized one of the women, when he turned back forcing her to accompany\r\nhim across the river. He had this black girl with him when an attack\r\nwas made on Mr. Thomson's house, but she escaped. On the following day\r\ntwo men were quietly driving in a cart along the road when the blacks\r\nattacked and speared them, killing one and wounding the other. The\r\nblacks went on and burned the hut of Mr. Nicholas. They attacked Mr.\r\nThomson's place, and speared a man named Scott. The woman who had been\r\nstolen by Dunne was present urging the blacks on when Scott was killed.\r\nThe troops were sent out to drive the blacks back, and while so engaged\r\ncame across the bushrangers and shot Dunne. One or two were captured\r\nand hung as related.\r\n\r\nThe _Hobart Town Gazette_, of the 29th of April, 1826, said that for\r\nsome months the roads had been safe, and with the executions to take\r\nplace that day, the colony might be congratulated on having at length\r\nstamped out the crime of bushranging. As a fact, it was only the close\r\nof the first epoch; the first act in the great bushranging tragedy\r\nwhich was to close so sensationally more than fifty years later.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons,\r\n1838.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The first supply of horned cattle for Australia was\r\nobtained from Capetown, South Africa, big-boned, slab-sided animals,\r\nwith enormous horns. These animals are much more active than the\r\nfine-boned, heavy-bodied, short-horned, or other fine breeds, but they\r\ncan never be properly tamed. It is always unsafe to milk one of these\r\ncows unless her head is fastened in \"a bail,\" and her leg tied. When\r\ndriving the cows into the bail it was the custom to order them to \"bail\r\nup.\" It was also usual for bullock drivers when yoking their teams to\r\ncall out \"bail up\" to the bullocks, although no bail was used for this\r\npurpose. The words were in constant use all over Australia, and were\r\nadopted by the early bushrangers in the sense of \"stand.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: History of Van Diemen's Land in the _Launceston\r\nAdvertiser, 1840_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Hobart Town Gazette, 1826._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Launceston Advertiser, 1840._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Hobart Town Gazette._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  Bushranging in New South Wales; Manufacturing Bushrangers; Employing\r\n  Bushrangers; The First Bank Robbery in Australia; Major Mudie and his\r\n  Assigned Servants; Terrible Hollow; Murder of Dr. Wardell; The Story\r\n  of Jack the Rammer; Hall Mayne and Others.\r\n\r\n\r\nBushranging of the more serious character with which we are concerned,\r\nappears to have begun in New South Wales in about 1822. In that year\r\nthirty-four bushrangers were hung in Sydney. The crimes for which these\r\nmen were executed were generally of a petty description. Robberies of\r\narticles from the farms had become so prevalent that it was deemed\r\nexpedient to adopt severe measures, but beyond removing so many\r\nevil-doers and preventing them from continuing their depredations, this\r\nseverity of the judicial authorities does not appear to have had much\r\neffect. Bushranging not only continued, but the bushrangers became\r\nbolder and operated over a wider area. On March 16th, 1826, a desperate\r\nfight took place between a party of mounted troopers and seven\r\nbushrangers near Bathurst. The Blue Mountains had only been crossed\r\nthirteen years before, and the settlement was a very small one. The\r\nleader of the gang, Morris Connell, was shot dead by Corporal Brown,\r\nand the other bushrangers ran away into the bush.\r\n\r\nThe _Sydney Monitor_ of September 22nd reports that a shepherd on Mr.\r\nH. Macarthur's run at Argyle ran away into the bush. He was captured,\r\nand taken to Goulburn to be tried for absconding. He complained that\r\nhe had not received his proper allowance of rations, and had gone to\r\nseek for food. He was of course found guilty, and, when sentenced to\r\nbe flogged, he sulkily said, \"It's in the power of the likes of me to\r\nhave revenge when lambing time comes round.\" For this threat he was\r\nsent to Liverpool for trial. He was convicted, and as a warning to\r\nother shepherds he was sentenced to receive five hundred lashes and to\r\nbe transported to a penal settlement for life. The _Monitor_ denounced\r\nthis sentence as being \"unduly harsh,\" and spoke of the heavy sentences\r\ngiven whenever the Rev. Samuel Marsden, Principal Chaplain of New South\r\nWales, took his seat on the Bench. The chaplains were at that time all\r\n_ex officio_ magistrates, and the Rev. Samuel Marsden was said to be\r\nvery active in the discharge of this portion of his duties. It is of\r\nMr. Marsden that Mr. J.T. Bigge says \"His sentences are not only more\r\nsevere than those of other magistrates, but the general opinion of\r\nthe colony is that his character, as displayed in the administrations\r\nof the penal law of New South Wales, is stamped with severity.\"[32]\r\nJudging from the sentence under notice, it does not appear that the\r\nreverend gentleman had become any more merciful since Commissioner\r\nBigge compiled his report some years before. The _Monitor_ charged him\r\nwith \"helping to manufacture bushrangers.\" In this connection I may\r\nmention that the opinion expressed by the \"old hands\" was that the\r\nclerical magistrates were generally far more cruel and brutal than the\r\nlay magistrates, and this opinion was crystallised into a cant phrase\r\nwhich was current among the old hands many years later. It was \"The\r\nLord have mercy on you, for his reverence will have none.\" This phrase\r\nwas used on all occasions, whether it was appropriate or not to the\r\nsubject under discussion or the circumstances of the time.\r\n\r\nIn the Windsor Court on February 10th, 1827, Mr. McCarthy was fined\r\n£14 10s., including costs, for having employed a returned bushranger\r\ninstead of handing him over to the police for punishment. About the\r\nsame time a bushranger was charged in Sydney with having bailed up a\r\nsettler's house and compelled him to hand over some money and a bottle\r\nof wine. Taking the wine was an aggravation of the offence which was\r\nmore than the worthy magistrate could stand. \"What right,\" he demanded\r\nof the delinquent, \"have you to drink wine? Do you not know, you\r\nrascal, that when you were convicted you forfeited all rights?\" \"Yes,\r\nyour honour,\" replied the culprit, \"But, I didn't forfeit my appetite.\"\r\n\r\nThe robbery of the Bank of Australia does not properly, perhaps, come\r\nunder the head of bushranging, but as the later bushrangers made\r\nbank robbery a feature of their depredations the record would not be\r\ncomplete if this, the first and in some respects the most remarkable of\r\nthe bank robberies which have taken place in Australia, was omitted.\r\nThe Bank of Australia was established in 1826 and was spoken of as the\r\n\"new bank\" to distinguish it from the older Bank of New South Wales.\r\nIt was also sometimes called \"the squatters' bank.\" Its president was\r\nMr. John Macarthur, the first of the squatters. It was situated in\r\nGeorge Street, Sydney. The strong room was constructed under ground,\r\nand had walls nine feet thick. Near the foundation of the bank was a\r\nlarge drain or shore, one of the openings of which was on an unoccupied\r\nplot of ground on the opposite side of the street to that in which\r\nthe bank stood. The other end of the drain terminated on the shore\r\nof the harbour. Into this drain the thieves must have entered, and\r\njudging from the amount of work done and the quantity of the remains of\r\nprovisions found afterwards they must have been at work for a week or\r\nmore. As they were too deep underground for the strokes of their picks\r\nor hammers to be heard, they may have worked night and day. However\r\nthat may be, they took the bricks out of the side of the drain facing\r\nthe bank and then dug a tunnel until they reached the foundations of\r\nthe bank. How they disposed of the earth dug out is not known, but it\r\nwas surmised that they carried it away in bags. With great labour they\r\ndislodged a stone at the corner of the foundations, and then gradually\r\nenlarged the hole until there was sufficient room for a man to get\r\nthrough. Having effected an entrance in this way into the strong room,\r\nthey found there forty boxes each containing £100 worth of British\r\nsilver coins; a smaller box containing two thousand sovereigns; a box\r\ncontaining one thousand dollars, and another containing five hundred\r\ndollars. But the robbers took only the two boxes containing dollars\r\nand seven of the forty boxes containing British silver; leaving\r\nthirty-three boxes of silver and the box of sovereigns. They took\r\nalso some bundles of bank notes, amounting to between ten and twelve\r\nthousand pounds worth. The forty boxes of silver weighed a ton, and it\r\nwas believed that the thieves had been disturbed by some noise before\r\nthey had time to remove so great a quantity. The locks on the boxes\r\nleft in the vault were found to have been so rusted by damp as to be\r\nuseless. No arrests were made and no traces of the robbers could be\r\nfound. Notifications were issued denying that the loss, heavy as it\r\nwas, would affect the stability of the bank, but it appears that it\r\nnever recovered. In 1833 it was re-organised. In 1845 the Government\r\npassed a Lottery Bill to enable the bank to raise money, but to no\r\npurpose. The bank failed in 1848 and caused a great many other failures\r\nand much distress. The robbery was discovered on September 15th, 1828,\r\nand was reported in the _Monitor_ of the 20th.\r\n\r\nThere has been much speculation in Sydney from time to time as to what\r\nbecame of the money stolen, and it has been reported that the thieves\r\nburied it somewhere on the shores of Snail's, or White Bay, or some\r\nother place on the opposite side of the Harbour to Sydney, but although\r\nseveral persons have searched for the hidden treasure, it has not yet\r\nbeen found. There is a somewhat similar legend of buried treasure at\r\nNorth Sydney. The story is, that a sum of money variously stated at one\r\nthousand and two thousand guineas, sent out in early times from England\r\nto pay the troops, was stolen from the ship while she lay at her anchor\r\nand was buried either near Mosman's Bay or Great Sirius Cove. This also\r\nhas been searched for at various times but hitherto without success.\r\nWhat truth there is in these legends it is now impossible to say.\r\n\r\nJohn Poole, James Ryan, and James Riley, assigned servants of Mr. John\r\nLarnack, son-in-law of Major James Mudie, of Castle Forbes estate,\r\nPatrick's Plains, Hunter River district, took to the bush on November\r\n4th, 1833. Three other assigned servants, Anthony Hitchcock, alias\r\nHath, Samuel Parrott or Powell, and David Jones, were sent away the\r\nfollowing morning, in charge of constable Samuel Cook, to Maitland,\r\nunder sentence of twelve months, in a chain gang for insubordination.\r\nAbout half-a-mile from Castle Forbes, Poole, Ryan, and Riley, and\r\nanother man named John Perry, who had been in the bush for some time\r\npreviously, met the constable and called on him to stand or they would\r\nshoot him. Cook only had a pistol with him and he snapped it at the\r\nrobbers and then surrendered. The robbers took the pistol from him,\r\nled him some distance off the road and tied him to a tree. Parrott\r\nrefused to go with the bushrangers and was tied to a tree near Cook.\r\nThe robbers went back to Mr. Larnack's house which they reached about\r\nnoon. They called upon Mrs. Larnack to stand, but she and one of the\r\nfemale servants jumped through a window and ran. Perry followed them\r\nand brought them back, threatening to blow Mrs. Larnack's brains out if\r\nshe refused to do as she was told. The robbers took a double-barrelled\r\ngun which was always kept loaded in Mr. Larnack's room, and some guns\r\nand fowling pieces from the dining-room. Hitchcock brought the shearers\r\nfrom the shed, walking behind them and threatening to shoot any man\r\nwho resisted. The robbers broke open the door of the store and put the\r\nshearers inside. They emptied a chest of tea into a bag, took bags of\r\nflour, sugar, and other provisions from the store, and fastened up the\r\ndoor leaving Perry on guard. They took a quantity of pork from the\r\nkitchen, a bucket of milk from the dairy, and the silver-plate and\r\nother valuables from the house. Then, having made the shearers secure\r\nin the store and locked Mrs. Larnack and the female servants in the\r\nkitchen, they went away after having told Mrs. Larnack that they were\r\nsorry \"the old----,\" the Major, was not at home, as they wanted to\r\nsettle him. One of them also expressed sorrow at the absence of Mr.\r\nLarnack, and added that when they could catch him they would \"stick\r\nhis head on the chimney for an ornament.\" As soon as the news of the\r\nrobbery became known, a party was organised to follow the bushrangers.\r\nMr. Robert Scott, mounted trooper Daniel Craddige, and a party of five\r\ncame up with the robbers at Mr. Reid's station, Lamb's Valley. Some\r\nshots were exchanged and then Jones and Perry ran away. Constable\r\nCraddige followed them and called on them to stand, and they did so. He\r\ntook them back and by that time Mr. Scott and the rest of the pursuing\r\nparty had captured Hitchcock, Poole and Riley. The boy Ryan got away\r\nin the scrub but was discovered and caught next day. Alexander Flood,\r\noverseer to Messrs. Robert and Helenes Scott, with two constables,\r\ntook charge of the prisoners, and conducted them safely to Maitland\r\nfor trial. Mr. John Larnack then said that on the morning of the 5th\r\nof November before the attack was made on the house, he was at the\r\nsheep-wash. The prisoners came up and said to the washers, \"Come out of\r\nthe water, every---- one of you, or we'll blow your---- brains out.\"\r\nLarnack jumped into the water among the washers. Hitchcock fired at him\r\nshouting, \"You'll never take me to court again, you----.\" He called\r\non the washers to get out of the way and let him shoot the----. Poole\r\nalso said, \"I'll take care you never get another man flogged.\" Larnack\r\nscrambled out of the wash-pool on the opposite side to where the\r\nrobbers were, and ran to the timber. He went on to Mr. Danger's farm,\r\nand remained there till next day. He was only ten yards distant when\r\nHitchcock fired at him. Shots from the other bushrangers struck the\r\nwater within twelve and eighteen inches of him, but none of them hit\r\nhim. The robbers had four double-barrelled guns, two single-barrelled\r\nfowling pieces, a musket, and two pistols, when they were captured.\r\nWhen asked what they had to say in defence, Hitchcock called Ensign\r\nZouch and other gentlemen to speak as to his character. It appears that\r\nuntil he was assigned to Major Mudie and Mr. Larnack, he had always\r\nbeen well behaved. The prisoners complained that they were given short\r\nrations, that the flour was mouldy and the meat bad, and that they were\r\nrepeatedly flogged. Some of them had been flogged for refusing to work\r\non Sunday. Hitchcock had been sentenced to work in an iron gang, for an\r\noffence of which he knew nothing. Whatever punishment was threatened by\r\nthe master was sure to be inflicted by the Bench. Jones was acquitted\r\nof the capital offence, but was sent to Norfolk Island for life. The\r\nother five prisoners were sentenced to death, Hitchcock and Poole being\r\nhung at Maitland, and Ryan, Perry and Riley at Sydney. An enquiry was\r\nheld as to the alleged illusage of their assigned servants, by Major\r\nMudie and Mr. Larnack, and they were acquitted by Governor Bourke of\r\nthe charges of tyranny and ill-treatment, but Major Mudie's name was\r\nremoved from the Commission of the Peace. On his return to the station\r\nafter the result of the enquiry had become known, he was greeted with\r\ncries of \"No more fifties now, you bloody old tyrant.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful valley of Burragorang is enclosed on all sides by\r\nprecipitous mountains, there being only one practicable entrance,\r\nwhich, in early times, before a government road was cut into it for\r\nthe convenience of the farmers who now occupy the valley, was easily\r\nblocked with a few saplings, so that sheep, cattle, or horses turned\r\ninto the valley could not escape. Precisely how the entrance to this\r\nextensive enclosure was first found is not known. It is believed,\r\nhowever, that it was discovered by a party of bushrangers, who\r\nendeavoured to discover a road over the Blue Mountains, in order to\r\nreach a settlement of white men, which was popularly supposed to lie\r\nsomewhere in that direction. Whether this supposed settlement was a\r\nDutch or an English settlement does not appear, but as I have already\r\nsaid, there was a wide-spread belief that some of these settlements\r\nwere at no very great distance from Sydney, and could be reached\r\noverland. The valley is situated only about fifty-four miles from\r\nSydney, and for many years was an absolutely secure hiding-place for\r\nbushrangers and their plunder. Later on the valley came to be known,\r\nfrom the horrible tales told of the convicts who made use of it,\r\nas \"Terrible Hollow,\" and under this name it is introduced by Rolf\r\nBoldrewood in his \"Robbery under Arms.\" Among the old hands themselves\r\nit was known as \"The Camp,\" \"The Shelter,\" or \"The Pound.\" Bark huts\r\nwere erected in this valley by the bushrangers, and here they retired\r\nwhen hard pressed or when wounded. When the secret of the entrance\r\nwas betrayed to the soldiers, who were out in search of a party of\r\nbushrangers, it was evident that the valley had been long in use by\r\nthe bushrangers. Cattle and sheep were running wild there, numbers of\r\nbroken shackles, handcuffs, and other relics were found, and, besides\r\nthese, evidences that several murders had been committed there; but\r\nthere are no records of these events, and only the recollections of\r\nthe legends which have been handed down among the old hands remain to\r\nexplain why this beautiful valley should have been called \"Terrible\r\nHollow.\" One of these legends may be told somewhat as follows: A\r\nsettler was reported to have received a large sum of money. This\r\nbecame known to the bushrangers and they determined to rob him of it.\r\nThey bailed up his place, tied his assigned servants, and searched\r\neverywhere for the money but could not find it. The settler declared\r\nthat he had not received the money, but was not believed. He was\r\nthreatened with death if he refused to disclose its hiding place. He\r\npersisted in his assertion that he had no money, and a consultation\r\nwas held by the bushrangers to decide what should be done with him.\r\nSome were for shooting him there and then; but, this was so evidently\r\nnot the way to extort money, if he had any, that it was resolved to\r\ntake him to \"the camp,\" and there force him to say where the money was\r\nhidden. When they got him there they tied him to a sapling, built a\r\ncircle of bushwood round him at some distance away, set fire to it, and\r\nslowly roasted him to death. His screams are said to have been fearful,\r\nbut no one heard them in that solitude except the fiends who were\r\ntorturing him, and they had been rendered too callous, by treatment\r\nlittle less fiendish by the authorities, to heed his agonised cries.\r\nWhether this story is literally true or not it is impossible to say,\r\nbut certainly charred remains of human bones were discovered in the\r\nvalley when it was searched, though whether the bodies had been burned\r\nbefore or after death could not, of course, be determined.\r\n\r\nIt was to this valley that Will Underwood and his gang were said to\r\nretire when hard pressed or when they required a rest. Underwood\r\noperated on the roads about Campbelltown, Liverpool, Penrith, and\r\nWindsor, sometimes sticking-up people, and robbing farms on Liberty\r\nPlains and other places between Parramatta and Sydney. The gang was a\r\nlarge one and continued to operate in the more populous districts for\r\nsome two years. Among the members of this gang were Johnny Donohoe,\r\nWebber, and Walmsley. Donohoe was shot by a trooper named Maggleton,\r\nnear Raby, in September, 1830. Webber was shot a month later, and\r\nWalmsley was captured in another skirmish between the troopers and the\r\nbushrangers. Walmsley was sentenced to death, but was reprieved for\r\ndisclosing the names of \"fences,\" or receivers of stolen property, and\r\nhis revelations caused quite a sensation, a number of hitherto highly\r\nrespected persons being implicated. Underwood was shot in 1832, and\r\nshortly afterwards a \"traitor\" is said to have led a party of soldiers\r\ninto Terrible Hollow. There was a fight between the troops and the\r\nbushrangers found there at the time, and several of the bushrangers\r\nwere captured and the gang was broken up. The evil reputation which the\r\nvalley had acquired, at first prevented settlement there, but when the\r\nbushrangers and their doings had been forgotten, the Government threw\r\nthe valley open for selection, and a number of farms were taken up or\r\npurchased. More recently, a line has been surveyed for a railway to the\r\nvalley, but this line has not yet been constructed. In the meantime, a\r\ngood road has been opened into the valley through the one practicable\r\nentrance, and those who visit the valley now for the first time, can\r\nscarcely credit the horrible stories which have been told in connection\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday in September, 1834, Dr. Robert Wardell, a practising\r\nbarrister in Sydney, and editor of _The Australian_, was riding\r\nacross his park, which stretched from the Parramatta road, where the\r\nmunicipality of Petersham now stands, to Cook's river, to look after\r\nhis herd of fallow deer, of which he was very proud. He jumped his\r\nhorse over a log and found himself confronted by three armed men.\r\nThinking they were poachers after his deer, he reined his horse in and\r\ncried, \"What are you doing here, you rascals?\" The reply was a shot\r\nfrom one of the guns, and the doctor fell. His horse galloped to the\r\nhouse and alarmed the family. Men were despatched in all directions\r\nto seek for the doctor, who it was believed had somehow been thrown\r\nand injured. The search was continued all day and night, but with no\r\nresult. The next day his body was found covered over with boughs,\r\napparently to prevent the dingoes from tearing it rather than to hide\r\nit. John Jenkins, Thomas Tattersdale and Emanuel Brace were arrested on\r\nsuspicion and charged with the murder. Evidence was produced that they\r\nhad been seen in the neighbourhood, and they were committed for trial.\r\nBrace was a lad who had only recently been sent to the colony, and\r\nbefore the day of trial he consented to turn King's evidence. From his\r\ntestimony it appeared that Jenkins was the man who had fired the gun.\r\nBut both he and Tattersdale were hung for the crime, and it was said\r\nthat they had been guilty of various acts of bushranging. After the\r\ndoctor's death the herd of fallow deer was neglected. Some were sold,\r\nand their descendants may still be seen in the park at Parramatta,\r\nand elsewhere. A large number, however, escaped, and the late Mr.\r\nCharles Hearn, for many years landlord of the Stag's Head Inn, on the\r\nParramatta road, about five miles from the Sydney Town Hall, used to\r\nboast that he shot the last of Dr. Warden's deer about where the Callan\r\nPark Lunatic Asylum now stands.\r\n\r\nThe story of Jack the Rammer illustrates the relationship which\r\nsometimes existed between the bushrangers and the assigned servants,\r\nand indicates the difficulties with which law-abiding citizens had\r\nto cope. Jack had been living by robbery in the Manaro district for\r\nsome time. One day Mr. Charles Fisher Shepherd, the overseer of the\r\nMichelago sheep station, said something about all bushrangers being\r\ncowards. One of the assigned servants on the station, named Bull,\r\nreplied, \"They'll be here next.\" \"If they come here,\" exclaimed\r\nShepherd, \"I'll give them a benefit.\" A few nights afterwards Shepherd\r\nwas asleep in his hut. He was awakened by someone calling on him to\r\ncome out. After a time he did so, and saw Jack the Rammer and a man\r\nnamed Boyd standing at the door. Jack cried out to him, \"Keep your\r\nhands down.\" They stood for a second or two regarding him, and then\r\nJack said, \"What a benefit you're giving us.\" The two bushrangers\r\nthen walked away. Although he felt convinced that Bull was in league\r\nwith the bushrangers and had reported his speech to them and that\r\nhe probably could not expect any assistance from the other assigned\r\nservants on the station, Shepherd loaded his gun with No. 4 shot, the\r\nlargest he had, and started off after the bushrangers. It was about\r\ndaybreak on a beautiful December morning in 1834, probably between\r\nthree and four o'clock, and the air was soft and balmy as he made his\r\nway through the bush in the direction in which the bushrangers had\r\ngone. After travelling some distance he came on a sort of a camp, and\r\nsaw Boyd through the trees. He kneeled down and fired, but missed. He\r\nwas about to fire the other barrel when Bull stepped from behind a\r\ntree close by, and said \"Don't shoot him, sir.\" \"By G----, I will,\"\r\nexclaimed Shepherd. \"If you fire, by G----, I'll shoot you,\" returned\r\nBull. Before Shepherd could reply another bushranger named Keys fired\r\nat him from behind a tree, and wounded him. Shepherd rushed forward,\r\nand was about to close with Keys when Boyd ran up and fired, wounding\r\nShepherd in the head. Keys seized him, but Shepherd shook himself free,\r\nand ran back to the station. He went to the house, roused up the owner,\r\nand said to him, \"Good God, Catterall, I'm shot all to pieces, and you\r\nnever help me.\" \"What's the good?\" returned Catterall. \"What can I do?\"\r\nJust then the bushrangers came up, and Catterall went in and shut the\r\ndoor. Shepherd rushed across to his own hut, and tried to shut himself\r\nin, but Boyd thrust the barrel of his gun in in time to prevent him.\r\nShepherd seized the gun and tried to wrench it out of Boyd's hands, but\r\nKeys pushed the door open and struck Shepherd on the head. Shepherd\r\nfell, and Boyd put the muzzle of his gun close against his chest and\r\npulled the trigger. The bushrangers, including Bull, then went away.\r\nIt was some hours later when Shepherd regained consciousness, and\r\nyelled out as loud as he could. He continued calling for some minutes,\r\nand at last Catterall came out of the house and went to the hut.\r\n\"Why,\" he said, as he looked at Shepherd, \"I thought you were dead.\"\r\nHe went away, but soon returned with several of the station hands,\r\nand had Shepherd carried into the house and put to bed. He sent for a\r\ndoctor and the police. When the doctor arrived he took fourteen slugs\r\nand bullets out of various parts of Shepherd's body. He recovered,\r\nand lived for many years afterwards. In the meantime the police\r\nfollowed the bushrangers, and shot Boyd as he was trying to escape by\r\nswimming across the Snowy River. Keys and Bull were captured, and were\r\nsubsequently hung. Jack the Rammer escaped for a time, but was shot a\r\nfew months later.\r\n\r\nOn September 24th, 1838, the bushrangers Hall and Mayne stuck up Mr.\r\nJoseph Roger's station at Currawang, near Yass. As they approached\r\nthe kitchen door the men inside rushed out, and the bushrangers fired\r\namong them. A lad named Patrick Fitzpatrick was struck in the mouth,\r\nthe bullet coming out at the crown of his head. Three of the men were\r\nwounded. The bushrangers appear to have regretted their act as soon as\r\nit was done. They made no attempt to get away, but assisted to carry\r\nthe wounded men into the kitchen. Hall had been captured previously,\r\nbut had succeeded in escaping from the Goulburn Gaol shortly before\r\nthis attack on Mr. Roger's station. When sentenced to death, he said,\r\n\"I've been all over the country in my time without taking the life of\r\nany one. I've been baited like a bull dog and I'm only sorry now that I\r\ndidn't shoot every---- tyrant in New South Wales.\" When taken from the\r\ncourt-house to the gaol, he said to the crowd assembled there, \"I've\r\nnever had anything to say against the prisoners, but I've a grudge\r\nagainst every---- swell in the country. I'll go to the gallows and die\r\nas comfortably as a biddy and be glad of the chance.\" The trial took\r\nplace on May 15th, 1839, and between then and the date fixed for the\r\nexecution. Hall made a desperate attempt to escape from Darlinghurst\r\nGaol. He failed and was hung on June 7th, with Michael Welsh, Donald\r\nMaynard, and his mate, Mayne.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1839, Mr. Bailley was returning to his home on the\r\nParramatta Road, Sydney, when he was knocked down and beaten by three\r\nmen near his own door. They took a roll of bank notes from his pocket,\r\nbut a vehicle driving rapidly approached and frightened them so that\r\nthey dropped the notes and ran. Mr. Bailley picked them up and went\r\nindoors.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Commission of Enquiry into the state of New South Wales,\r\n1822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Select Committee of the House of Commons on\r\nTransportation.--July, 1837. Major Mudie's evidence.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  John Lynch; Murder of Kearns Landregan; Lynch's Trial and Sentence;\r\n  His Terrible Confession; Murder of the Frazers, Father and Son;\r\n  Murder and Cremation of the Mulligans; His Appeals to Almighty God.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Lynch is usually regarded as the most callous and brutal of the\r\nbushrangers of New South Wales. He was transported from Cavan, Ireland,\r\nin October, 1831. For some months after his arrival in the colony he\r\nworked in a road gang in the neighbourhood of Sydney and was then\r\nassigned to Mr. Barton as a farm servant. Soon after his arrival at\r\nthe farm, near Berrima, he appears to have exercised his ingenuity in\r\nstealing any articles which he could find and of selling them to any\r\nperson who would buy them. In 1835 was arrested and tried at Berrima\r\non a charge of having stolen a saddle from his employer but was\r\nacquitted. He \"bolted\" into the bush and a few days afterwards a man\r\nnamed Thomas Smith, who had been witness in a case of highway robbery,\r\nwas found dead in the scrub. Several bushrangers were arrested. Lynch\r\nbeing among them, on suspicion of having decoyed Smith from his hut\r\nand beaten his brains out with clubs as \"a warning to traitors,\" as\r\nall those were called who gave evidence against bushrangers. Lynch\r\nwas again acquitted, but two others were hung for the murder. During\r\nthe following two or three years he was sentenced to twelve months'\r\nimprisonment for having harboured bushrangers, and on February 21st,\r\n1841, he was arrested at \"Mulligan's Farm\" and charged with the murder\r\nof Kearns Landregan. On the 19th, Mr. Hugh Tinney was travelling to\r\nSydney with his bullock dray and camped for the night at Ironstone\r\nBridge. The next morning his driver walked along the creek bank to\r\nlook for the bullocks. He noticed some freshly cut scrub piled up, and,\r\nbeing curious to know what it had been placed there for, he pulled\r\nsome branches away and discovered the newly-murdered body of a man.\r\nOn examining further, he found that the head had been fearfully cut\r\nand battered. Round the neck was a piece of string, and to this were\r\nattached an Agnus Dei and a temperance medal. Mr. Tinney sent Sturges,\r\nthe bullock-driver, to Berrima to give information, and he returned\r\nwith Chief Constable Noel, Mr. James Harper, the police magistrate, and\r\nDr. McDonald. On search being made, signs of a camp were found not far\r\naway. A small fire had been lighted as if to boil a quart pot of tea,\r\nand some remains of hay were found, showing that a horse had been fed\r\nthere. It was noticed that grey hairs were scattered about where the\r\nhorse had rolled, and therefore it was evident that the horse was of\r\nthat colour. During the day investigations were made by the police, and\r\nthe following morning Chief Constable Chapman, Sergeant Freer, and Mr.\r\nJohn Chalker, landlord of the Woolpack Inn, Nattai, went to Mulligan's\r\nFarm, Wombat Brush, and identified John Dunleavy, as John Lynch, a\r\nprisoner illegally at large. When arrested on the charge of having\r\nmurdered Kearns Landregan, Lynch exclaimed: \"I am innocent, I leave it\r\nto God and man. I don't blame you, Chapman, but Chalker is interfering\r\ntoo much in what doesn't concern him.\"\r\n\r\nA grey horse was found at the farm, and Chalker identified this as the\r\nhorse which Lynch had been driving when he stopped at the Woolpack\r\nfor dinner. Lynch had \"shouted\" for Landregan and the landlord before\r\nleaving, and Chalker gave him a bundle of hay for the horse. The hay\r\nwas rye grass, similar to that found at the camp.\r\n\r\nLynch was tried at Berrima on March 21st, 1842, before the Chief\r\nJustice, Sir James Dowling. Mary Landregan said that the body found\r\nwas that of her husband. The temperance medal had been given to him by\r\nFather Mathew before they left Ireland. They were both teetotallers,\r\nand had come to Australia as free immigrants. Her husband had about £40\r\nwhen he left his last place and started to look for another job. She\r\nhad not seen him since, but he had sent word, by Susan Beale, servant\r\nat Mr. Chalker's hotel, that he had engaged to put up fencing and do\r\nother work for Mr. Dunleavy for £15.\r\n\r\nA leather belt on which the words \"Jewish Harp\" had been scratched,\r\napparently with the point of a knife, was found at the farm, and was\r\nidentified as the property of Kearns Landregan by his brother, who said\r\nthat Kearns had promised to meet him at a public-house of that name in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and had scratched the name on his belt so that he\r\nmight remember it.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence showed that Lynch had purchased, at the Post Office\r\nStores, Berrima, on the 20th February, a merino dress, some women's\r\ncaps, a pair of child's shoes, and some tobacco. He was served by Mrs.\r\nMary Higgins and gave her a £5 note in payment. From the store he went\r\nto Michael Doyle's, White Horse Hotel, and bought two gallons of rum,\r\nfour gallons of wine, half a chest of tea, and a bag of sugar. He gave\r\nhis name as John Dunleavy, Wombat, and said he had taken Mulligan's\r\nfarm. He gave six £1 notes and a note of hand for £5 2s. in payment.\r\nThe goods were placed in a cart drawn by a grey horse. Some of the Bank\r\nnotes were identified as having been among those carried by Landregan.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of witnesses, and the case against the prisoner\r\nwith regard to the murder of Landregan was very clear. It was\r\nalso stated that Mr. and Mrs. Mulligan and their two children had\r\ndisappeared suddenly, and that there was a suspicion that they had been\r\nmurdered. Lynch produced a letter dated from Wollongong purporting to\r\nhave been signed by Mulligan, but the writing was said to be unlike\r\nthat of Mulligan. Several other mysterious disappearances were also\r\nspoken of. When asked what he had to say Lynch replied that he had met\r\nLandregan on the road, and Landregan asked him to carry his swag for\r\nhim. Landregan said he had been gambling at McMahon's public-house,\r\nand must have left his money there. Lynch told him to get up and ride\r\nas far as he was going his way. When they reached Bolland's, Lynch\r\nasked Landregan to have a drink, but Landregan refused, saying that his\r\nwife was there, and that he did not want her to see him. When they\r\ngot a little further along the road Landregan got down, took his swag,\r\nand walked away into the bush, and he had not seen him since. Lynch\r\ncomplained that he had been treated very unfairly. He had, he said,\r\nbeen sent out for seven years, but had been treated as a \"lifer.\" He\r\nhad served his time fairly, but he could not get his rights. When his\r\nfather died in Ireland he had left him between £600 and £700. That was\r\nhow he bought Mulligan's farm.\r\n\r\nLynch was found guilty, and, in passing sentence, his Honour said:\r\n\"John Lynch, the trade in blood which has so long marked your career\r\nis at last terminated, not by any sense of remorse, or the sating of\r\nany appetite for slaughter on your part, but by the energy of a few\r\nzealous spirits, roused into activity by the frightful picture of\r\natrocity which the last tragic passage of your worthless life exhibits.\r\nIt is now credibly believed, if not actually ascertained, that no less\r\nthan nine other individuals have fallen by your hands. How many more\r\nhave been violently ushered into another world remains undiscovered,\r\nsave in the dark pages of your own memory. By your own confession it\r\nis admitted that as late as 1835 justice was invoked on your head\r\nfor a frightful murder committed in this immediate neighbourhood.\r\nYour unlucky escape on that occasion has, it would seem, whetted your\r\ntigrine relish for human gore--but at length you have fallen into toils\r\nfrom which you cannot escape.\" His Honour quoted from the evidence\r\nat length, and said that the prisoner had \"spared neither age nor\r\nyouth in gratifying his sordid lust for gain.\" The disappearance of\r\nthe Mulligans had not been accounted for, but there could be little\r\ndoubt that the prisoner knew what their fate was. He concluded his\r\nexordium by saying that too much praise could not be bestowed, \"not\r\nmerely on the police, but upon the inhabitants of the neighbourhood,\r\nin unravelling the dark mystery of Landregan's death, and bringing his\r\nblood home to your door.\" He then pronounced sentence in the usual form.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner listened throughout with an unmoved countenance, and\r\nwhen the Judge had finished he said he hoped his Honour would order\r\nthat the small amount due as wages to the Barnetts should be paid.\r\nThey were innocent of any complicity in the offence with which he had\r\nbeen charged, and he hoped they would soon be released from gaol.\r\nThere was also £1 due to a boy who had been working on the farm, and\r\nhe hoped this would also be paid. Whatever had happened at the farm\r\nit had happened before either the Barnetts or the boy went there, and\r\nthey knew nothing about it. For some days after his sentence John\r\nLynch continued to assert that he was innocent, but finding, as is\r\nsupposed, that there was no hope of a reprieve, he asked to see the\r\nRev. Mr. Sumner on the day before that fixed for his execution, and in\r\nthe presence of the police magistrates and the minister, made a very\r\nextraordinary confession, of which the following is a brief summary:--\r\n\r\nHe arrived in the colony in 1832 in the _Dunvegan Castle_. The entry on\r\nhis indent was:--\"False pretences; sentence, life.\" This was wrong. He\r\nhad only been sentenced to seven years' penal servitude. He had applied\r\nto the authorities at the Hyde Park Barracks for his free papers, but\r\nhad been kept waiting a fortnight without getting any satisfaction. So\r\nhe returned to the Berrima district, where he had been assigned. He\r\nwent to John Mulligan for advice and assistance. Mulligan had a lot of\r\ngoods and valuables, which Lynch is supposed to have stolen and left at\r\nthe farm. He wanted to sell them, but Mulligan refused to give a fair\r\nprice for them. Lynch had made up his mind to live honestly, but this\r\ntreatment disgusted him. He complained bitterly of the dishonesty of\r\nmen who were in a good position and who \"ought to have known better.\"\r\nHe left Mulligan's and went to T.B. Humphrey's farm at Oldbury and\r\nstole eight bullocks, which he had himself broken in, and started\r\nwith them for Sydney, with the intention of selling them, so that he\r\nmight \"start honest.\" At Mount Razorback he fell in with a man named\r\nIreland, who was in charge of a loaded team belonging to Mr. Thomas\r\nCowper. The load was a valuable one, consisting of wheat, bacon, and\r\nother farm produce. Lynch thought it would pay him better to kill\r\nIreland and take possession of the dray and its load than to sell Mr.\r\nHumphrey's bullocks. He therefore camped with Ireland that night, and\r\n\"they were very friendly.\" In the morning a black boy who accompanied\r\nIreland went to look for the bullocks, and Lynch followed and killed\r\nhim. He returned to the camp without his absence having been noticed\r\nby Ireland, and watched for a chance. Ireland had no suspicion of foul\r\nplay, and Lynch soon got near enough to him to strike him a blow with\r\nhis tomahawk. Lynch hid the bodies in a cleft between two rocks, and\r\npiled stones over them. He remained at the camp two days. On the second\r\nday two other teams arrived at the camp in charge of men named Lee and\r\nLagge, and they all agreed to travel together for company. When near\r\nLiverpool Mr. Cowper rode up and was surprised to find a stranger in\r\ncharge of his dray. Lynch told him a plausible story to the effect that\r\nIreland had been taken suddenly ill, and had asked him to take the\r\nteam on. The black boy had stayed behind to nurse Ireland, and they\r\nwere to follow as soon as Ireland got well enough. Mr. Cowper believed\r\nhim and was satisfied, and after making enquiries as to where Ireland\r\nwas stopping, arranged with Lynch where they should meet in Sydney.\r\nThe time and place having been agreed on, Mr. Cowper rode away. Lee\r\nand Lagge were bound for Parramatta, and therefore, when they reached\r\nthe junction of the Dog Trap Road with the Liverpool Road, they parted\r\ncompany with Lynch, who kept straight on. Left by himself, Lynch drove\r\non night and day, reaching Sydney two days before the time appointed\r\nfor him to meet Mr. Cowper. He hired a man who was half drunk to sell\r\nthe loading, and as soon as he had received the money for the loading\r\nhe started away with the team on the Illawarra Road. When near George's\r\nriver he met Chief Constable McAlister, of Campbelltown, and fearing\r\nthat he might have been recognised, he turned off the road on to a\r\ncross track leading towards the Berrima road. He knew there would soon\r\nbe a hue and cry after him and feared that McAlister would report\r\nhaving met him on the Illawarra road. He travelled on until he came\r\nback to Razorback, near where the murder had been committed. Here he\r\nmet the Frazers, father and son, driving a horse team owned by Mr.\r\nBawten. He kept company with them and they camped together at Bargo\r\nBrush. Another horse team with which there were two men and their wives\r\nalso camped there. After their supper Lynch was lying under his dray\r\nwhen a mounted trooper rode up and asked Frazer some questions about\r\na dray which had been stolen, and which belonged to Mr. Cowper. The\r\nFrazers were unable to give him any information and the trooper rode\r\naway without noticing Lynch, who was lying under the very dray he was\r\nenquiring about. This narrow escape gave Lynch a terrible shock. He\r\nlay awake all night thinking of the danger he was running by keeping\r\nthis dray. He \"prayed to Almighty God to assist and enlighten\" him\r\nin this emergency, and feeling much strengthened he resolved to kill\r\nthe Frazers and take their dray. Having arrived at this decision he\r\nbecame calmer and thought out the details of his plan carefully. In\r\nthe morning Lynch left the camp under the pretence that he was going\r\nto look for his bullocks, but in reality to drive them away. On his\r\nreturn he reported that he could not find them and spoke of the trouble\r\nbullocks gave by their wandering habits. He asked the Frazers to help\r\nhim to pull his dray into the bush where he could leave it safely until\r\nhe could return with another team of bullocks and take it home. There\r\nwas nothing surprising in this, as bullocks frequently stray away home\r\nas soon as they are unyoked and will travel astonishing distances,\r\neven when hobbled, before morning. The Frazers, therefore, helped\r\nLynch to drag the dray away from the road to where there was a clump\r\nof trees, and then yoked up their horses. Lynch put such few things as\r\nhe had in the dray into Frazer's cart, and they all started together.\r\nThat night they camped at Cordeaux Flat. In the morning young Frazer\r\nstarted to find the horses, and Lynch accompanied him. Lynch wore a\r\ncoat because, he said, it was rather cold. As a fact, it was to hide\r\nhis tomahawk. When they were in the bush, out of sight of the camp.\r\nLynch found \"no difficulty in settling him.\" He struck one blow, and\r\n\"the young fellow fell like a log of wood.\" Lynch returned to the camp\r\nleading one horse, and said the lad was looking for the other. This\r\nmade Frazer very uneasy, not on account of his son, but because he had\r\nnever known the horses to part company before, and feared that some one\r\nmust have stolen the other horse. He \"fidgeted about\" until Lynch, who\r\nhad been watching for an opportunity, got behind him and \"struck him\r\none blow and killed him dead.\" Lynch buried the two bodies a little\r\nway off the road and remained at the camp all day. The next morning he\r\ndrove through Berrima to Mulligan's farm. He told Mrs. Mulligan that\r\nthe dray and horses belonged to a gentleman in Sydney. He asked her\r\nfor the £30 which he said her husband owed him for the articles which\r\nhe had left at the farm, and which he had obtained by burglary and\r\nhighway robbery. Mrs. Mulligan assured him on oath that all she had in\r\nthe house was £9. Lynch felt sure she was only \"putting him off,\" and\r\nfelt very much discouraged. He walked to Mr. Gray's, Black Horse Inn,\r\nabout three miles down the road, and bought two bottles of rum. On his\r\nreturn he gave some to Mr. and Mrs. Mulligan, but \"took very little\"\r\nhimself. He sat down on a log near the fence, and thought, \"This man\r\npassed me by as if he didn't know me when I was in the iron gang in\r\nBerrima. He never offered me a shilling though he has made pounds out\r\nof me, and I risked my life to obtain it. It would be a judgment on\r\nhim to take all he's got for the way he's treated a poor prisoner.\r\nOh, Almighty God, assist me and direct me what to do.\" After praying\r\nhe felt strengthened and returned to the hut. Mrs. Mulligan told him\r\nthat she had dreamed that she had a baby and that he had taken it away\r\nand killed it. \"It was all covered with blood and looked horrible.\"\r\nLynch joked with her about this dream; but, at the same time, he \"felt\r\nvery frightened.\" He believed that \"she could foretell things,\" and\r\nhe knew that \"she could toss balls and turn cups.\" He went away again\r\nand prayed to God to enlighten him, and at last made up his mind to\r\n\"kill the lot.\" He returned to the hut and \"talked pleasantly.\" Then\r\nhe asked young Mulligan, who was about sixteen years of age, to \"come\r\nand cut some wood\" for the fire. The boy went with him, and as they\r\nwalked along Lynch spoke to the lad of the fine property he would have\r\n\"when the old man died;\" adding, \"Ah, Johnny, you don't know what's in\r\nstore for you.\" They chopped up several sticks and then, when the boy\r\nwas stooping, Lynch swung the axe round and \"hit him on the head.\" He\r\nthrew a few branches over the body, and then, picking up an armful of\r\nthe wood they had cut walked back to the house. Mrs. Mulligan asked him\r\nwhere her boy was, and Lynch replied that he'd \"gone to the paddock\r\nwith the horses.\" Mrs. Mulligan was very uneasy and asked Lynch to fire\r\nhis gun off, as a signal to the boy to return. Lynch said this might\r\nbring the police round and he didn't want them \"to see that dray.\"\r\nMulligan also objected to the gun being fired. Both Mulligan and his\r\nwife were greatly excited. The old man paced up and down in front of\r\nthe house, while the old woman, after asking Lynch several times what\r\nhe had done with her boy, started up the path to look for him. Then\r\nsaid Lynch, \"I knew it was time for something to be done.\" He got his\r\ntomahawk without being seen, walked up to the old man and cried \"Look!\"\r\nMulligan turned round and looked up the road where Lynch pointed, Lynch\r\nstruck him \"one tap\" and he \"fell like a log.\" Lynch then followed Mrs.\r\nMulligan, tripped her up and killed her. He walked back to the hut and\r\nsaw the daughter, a girl of fourteen, standing behind the table with\r\na large butcher's knife in her hand. She was trembling violently. He\r\nsaid to her \"Put down that knife,\" She hesitated to obey him, and he\r\ncried louder, \"Put down that knife.\" Then she put it down. He walked\r\nround the table and took her hand. He said he did not wish to hurt\r\nher, but if he let her live she would \"only put him away.\" He told her\r\nto \"pray for her soul,\" as she had \"only ten minutes to live.\" She\r\nsobbed bitterly and he tried to comfort her, talking very seriously,\r\nand telling her that life was full of trouble, and that she would be\r\nbetter dead. Then he took her into the inner room, and after having\r\nviolated her, brought her out again and killed her with the tomahawk.\r\nHe dragged the four bodies together, heaped firewood over them and\r\nset fire to the heap. \"I never seen nothing like it,\" he said. \"They\r\nburned as if they was bags of fat.\" He threw the greater part of their\r\nclothing on to the fire and burned it. He stayed at the farm all next\r\nday, and then, when he had \"made things right,\" he went to Sydney. Here\r\nhe inserted an advertisement in the _Sydney Gazette_ to the effect that\r\nMrs. Mulligan having left her home without his consent he would not be\r\nresponsible for any debts she might contract. This was signed \"John\r\nMulligan.\" He returned to the farm and wrote letters to those people to\r\nwhom he knew Mulligan owed money, informing them that he had sold the\r\nfarm to John Dunleavy, who would pay their accounts. These letters he\r\nalso signed \"John Mulligan.\" Lynch then engaged Terence Barnett and his\r\nwife to work on the farm, and stayed there quietly for six months. The\r\nstories he told in the neighbourhood induced the belief that Mulligan\r\nhad taken him in with regard to the farm, and that he had paid more\r\nfor it than it was worth. At the end of six months Lynch paid another\r\nvisit to Sydney, and on his return journey met with Kearns Landregan,\r\nwho said he was looking for work. Lynch engaged him to put up some\r\nfencing. Landregan agreed and got into the cart. Lynch drove on until\r\nthey were passing Crisp's Inn. Here Landregan crouched down as if to\r\nhide himself. Lynch asked him what he did that for. Landregan replied\r\nthat he had summoned Crisp for stealing a bundle of clothes from him\r\nand didn't want a row about it then. Lynch felt sorry that he had\r\nengaged Landregan and determined to get rid of him. He decided to camp\r\nat Ironstone Bridge and, when Landregan was sitting on a log near the\r\ncamp fire, Lynch crept up behind him and struck him with the tomahawk.\r\nIn his confession Lynch was very particular in pointing out that in\r\nall his previous murders he had not struck any one of his victims\r\nmore than one blow with the tomahawk or axe. Landregan, however, was\r\na big powerful man, who boasted that he had never met his match in\r\nwrestling, and Lynch felt afraid of him. He therefore departed from his\r\nrule and struck Landregan twice. He attributed his \"ill-luck\" in being\r\ncaught and convicted to this breach of the rule he had laid down for\r\nhimself. Lynch seems to have persuaded himself that he was acting under\r\nDivine inspiration in committing his murders. He was very emphatic\r\nin his assertions that he never committed a murder, without having\r\nfirst prayed to Almighty God to assist and direct him, until he felt\r\nsufficiently strengthened to carry out his intentions. He appeared to\r\nbelieve that he was justified in taking life. Whatever may be thought\r\nof his confessions, however, there can be no doubt that the main\r\nfacts were correct. After his death a search was made at the places\r\nwhere he said he had hidden or buried his victims, and in all cases\r\nthe remains were found as he had stated they would be. With regard to\r\nthe Mulligans, a large heap of ashes was searched and found to contain\r\nhuman remains. The confession only included his more serious crimes. He\r\nsaid nothing about the numerous robberies he had committed at various\r\ntimes, nor of his relations with other bushrangers, with whom it was\r\nknown he was on cordial terms during at least a portion of his career.\r\nLynch was hanged at Berrima on April 22nd, 1842. At that time he was\r\nonly twenty-nine years of age. He was about five feet three and a half\r\ninches in height, of fair complexion, with brown hair and hazel eyes.\r\nThere was nothing ferocious in his appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  Jackey Jackey, the Gentleman Bushranger; His Dispute with Paddy\r\n  Curran; Some Legends About Him; Jackey Jackey Always Well-dressed and\r\n  Mounted; His Capture at Bungendore; His Escape at Bargo Brush; Jackey\r\n  Jackey Visits Sydney; His Capture by Miss Gray; Paddy Curran's Fight\r\n  with the Police; Recaptured and Hung; John Wright Threatens to Make a\r\n  Clean Sweep.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Westwood, better known as Jackey Jackey, was the darling of the\r\nold hands. He was only an errand boy in England, and was transported\r\nfor some small peccadillo when he was sixteen years of age. He landed\r\nin Sydney in 1837, and was assigned to Mr. Phillip Gidley King, at\r\nGidley, in the Goulburn district. He stayed at the station for nearly\r\nthree years, and then, in company with a notorious scoundrel named\r\nPaddy Curran, stuck up and robbed his employer's house. The partnership\r\nbetween Jackey Jackey and Curran, however, did not last very long.\r\nCurran disgusted Jackey Jackey by his brutality to women. In one of\r\ntheir mutual enterprises Curran criminally assaulted a woman, the\r\nwife of the farmer whose place they had stuck up. Jackey Jackey was\r\nfurious. He declared that even if a man was a bushranger he might be\r\na gentleman, and added that he would never see a woman insulted. He\r\nthreatened to shoot Curran unless he left at once, and stripped him of\r\nhis horse, arms and ammunition. This story furnishes the key-note to\r\nJackey Jackey's character. To the old hands he was always the gentleman\r\nbushranger. The stories told by them about the Jewboy and other\r\nbushrangers, and even about Mathew Brady, were generally coarse and\r\nsometimes brutal, but Jackey Jackey was always polite and well-behaved.\r\nMore legends have collected round the name of Jackey Jackey than round\r\nthat of any other of the bushrangers, and many of them are obviously\r\nvariants of the stories told of the historical highwaymen of England.\r\nFor instance, Jackey Jackey is said to have bailed up the carriage\r\nof the Commissary. When he discovered that the Commissary's wife was\r\ninside he dismounted, opened the door and, sweeping the ground with\r\nhis cabbage tree hat, as he bowed low before her, he invited her to\r\nfavour him with a step on the green. He rode incredible distances in\r\nincredibly short periods of time. He is represented as bailing up a\r\nman near Goulburn and telling him to note the time by his watch and\r\nthen racing away and bailing up another man at Braidwood or some other\r\nplace a hundred or a hundred and fifty miles away in a few hours and\r\nasking that person to note the time. Many of the popular stories told\r\nabout him are so evidently apocryphal that little notice can be taken\r\nof them. But one thing is certain and that is that he was always well\r\nmounted. He scorned to steal an inferior horse and would travel miles\r\nto secure a racer. He stole racehorses from Mr. Murray, Mr. Julian, and\r\nmany other gentlemen in the districts over which he ranged.\r\n\r\nAlthough he appears to have been of humble origin he is credited with\r\nhaving been highly educated. This point was especially insisted upon by\r\nhis eulogists among the old hands. By them he was always represented\r\nas being \"able to hold his own,\" in conversation, with \"the best of\r\n'em.\" I remember one old fellow telling me that when Jackey Jackey\r\nmet Governor Gipps (of which meeting, however, I can find no record)\r\nthe governor and the bushranger had a long conversation and parted\r\nmutually pleased with each other. \"You and me,\" said the old chap,\r\n\"couldn't have understood what they said though it was all English;\r\nbut, they talked grammar.\" What his precise meaning was I had no\r\nidea, but I have always thought that he intended to suggest that\r\ntheir conversation was all carried on in what he might have called\r\n\"dictionary words;\" that is, words not used by the uneducated. But\r\neverything said of Jackey Jackey redounds to his credit from the old\r\nhand point of view. He was emphatically \"a good man.\" The meaning\r\nattached to words is purely conventional, and is therefore liable\r\nto vary with the conventionalities. The point of view of the convict\r\nbeing entirely different to that of the law-abiding citizen, the terms\r\n\"good\" and \"bad\" changed places in their vocabulary. Thus the clergy,\r\nthe magistrates, the free men, were generally \"bad men,\" while those\r\nwho resisted authority, who fought against law and order, were \"good\r\nmen.\" Even the cannibal Pierce was a good man from their point of view,\r\nhowever strongly they might condemn his methods. But Jackey Jackey,\r\nalthough he continued the fight to the bitter end, and ended his life\r\non the gallows when he was only twenty-six, never did anything mean\r\nor brutal or unworthy of a gentleman bushranger, until he was almost\r\ngoaded to madness by the cruel discipline of Norfolk Island.\r\n\r\nPaddy Curran was \"out in the bush\" several months before Jackey Jackey\r\njoined him, and he was not the only bushranger at work in the district.\r\nOn December 31st, 1839, the station of the Rev. Mr. Cartwright was\r\nstuck up and robbed. On the same day a skirmish between the police\r\nand seven mounted bushrangers took place near Yass. One of the police\r\nhorses was killed, and the police were compelled to retreat. On the\r\nsame day, Mr. Heffernan's house, not far from Goulburn, was stuck up\r\nand robbed of £21 in money, a case of duelling pistols, a valuable\r\nmare, and other property. Mr. Israel Shepherd also lost a valuable\r\nhorse, besides some money, and Mr. Charles Campbell was reported to\r\nhave been shot dead. This is a heavy record for one day, and as the\r\nrobberies took place so far distant from each other, there must have\r\nbeen at least three separate parties concerned in them. About the same\r\ntime it was reported that Scotchy and Whitton were plundering the\r\nstations on the Lachlan River in all directions, and that Mr. Arthur\r\nRankin had left his station and retired to Sydney in consequence of\r\nthe insecurity in the country districts. The robberies continued all\r\nthrough the year 1840, and a great part of 1841.\r\n\r\nOn January 13th of the last-mentioned year a man ran into the township\r\nof Bungendore, and said that Jackey Jackey had followed and fired at\r\nhim. A few minutes' later Jackey Jackey himself, mounted on a splendid\r\nmare, which he had stolen from the Messrs. Macarthur, hove in sight\r\non the plains. He was dressed in a fine suit of clothes which he had\r\nobtained when he stuck up and robbed the store at Boro a few days\r\nbefore. He stopped to speak to a man near Eccleton's. In the meantime\r\nMr. Powell, the resident magistrate, and his brother, Mr. Frank Powell,\r\npromptly mounted and went towards the bushranger, and were joined\r\nby Richard Rutledge, who, however, had no arms. As they approached\r\nJackey Jackey wheeled round and fired at them, but failed to hit any\r\none. Mr. Balcombe and the Rev. Mr. McGrath drove up in a gig, and Mr.\r\nMcGrath jumped down and presented his gun. Jackey Jackey seeing himself\r\nsurrounded, surrendered. He explained that his mare had come a long\r\njourney and was unfit to travel, and that his musket was out of order\r\nand would not go off. He was conducted to the inn and placed in a room,\r\ntwo ticket-of-leave men being placed there to guard him. Jackey Jackey\r\nsat very quiet for some time. Then he jumped up suddenly, knocked down\r\none of his guards, snatched his musket, jumped through the window, and\r\nran across the plain. Frank Powell, who was close at hand, followed\r\nhim, and with the assistance of Dr. Wilson's postman, recaptured him.\r\nAmong other exploits previous to this capture Jackey Jackey had robbed\r\nthe Queanbeyan, Tarago, and other mails, stuck up Mr. Julian, Mr.\r\nEdinburgh, and a number of other people on the roads at various times\r\nand places, stolen horses from all the principal owners and breeders in\r\nthe district, fired at the driver of the Bungendore mail, who escaped,\r\nand had robbed the Boro Creek store of clothing, money, provisions, and\r\nother articles, on the Tuesday before his capture. For several months\r\nLieutenant Christie and the whole of the mounted police of the district\r\nhad been trying to capture him, and he had more than once escaped only\r\nby the superior fleetness of his horses. As soon as possible after his\r\ncapture he was handed over to Lieutenant Christie, who conducted him\r\nto Goulburn, where he was lodged in the lock-up. The following day he\r\nwas being taken to Bargo Brush, on the road to Sydney, when he made\r\na desperate attempt to escape on foot, running for a mile before he\r\nwas recaptured. He was then tied on the horse and the journey was\r\nresumed, but at night he broke out of the Bargo lock-up, taking with\r\nhim the watch-house keeper's arms and ammunition. He soon procured a\r\nhorse, and on the following day stuck up Mr. Francis Macarthur on the\r\nGoulburn Plains. He robbed Mr. Macarthur of his watch, money, and other\r\nvaluables, and took one of his carriage horses because it was better\r\nthan the animal he was riding.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the other bushrangers in the district had not been\r\nidle. In September, 1840, a fight took place between the police and the\r\nbushrangers near Wellington. One of the bushrangers was shot dead, and\r\na mounted trooper was wounded in the shoulder. A few days later another\r\nencounter occurred, when a constable was shot dead within two miles of\r\nthe township.\r\n\r\nOn October 3rd, Mr. Robert Smith's station, Newria, was attacked by\r\nfour armed bushrangers and plundered of everything worth carrying away.\r\nMr. Aarons had recently arrived from Sydney, with the intention of\r\nopening a store in Wellington. The bushrangers threatened to throw him\r\ninto the fire unless he handed over his money. They got upwards of £400\r\nfrom him. Mr. McPhillamy rode up at the time, and was invited by one\r\nof the bushrangers to dismount and come in. He dismounted, and then,\r\ndiscovering the class of men he had to deal with, quickly jumped on his\r\nhorse again and started. The bushrangers fired at him, and one of the\r\nbullets so severely injured his hand that it had to be amputated. A\r\nreward of £200 was offered for the capture of these men.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, May 18th, 1841, a gentleman, mounted on a spirited horse,\r\npulled up at the tollbar on the Parramatta Road, Sydney, and asked\r\nthe toll-keeper if he could oblige him with a pipe of tobacco. The\r\ntoll-keeper gave him a piece, and the gentleman dismounted and filled\r\nhis pipe. As he stood at the door of the toll-house he remarked a\r\nfirelock hanging over the mantelpiece, and asked what it was for. \"For\r\nbushrangers,\" replied the toll man. \"But there are none now. I've never\r\nseen it taken down since I've been here.\" \"Did you ever hear of Jackey\r\nJackey?\" enquired the gentleman. \"Oh, yes,\" replied the toll man,\r\n\"but he's a long way away. He never comes to Sydney. If he did he'd\r\nsoon be caught.\" \"Not at all,\" replied the gentleman laughing. \"They\r\ndon't know how to catch him, nor to keep him when they do catch him.\r\nI'm Jackey Jackey.\" He raised the lappels of his coat as he spoke and\r\nshowed a brace of pistols stuck in his belt on each side. The tollman\r\nlooked very much alarmed, but the bushranger said to him, \"Don't be\r\nfrightened, I am not going to hurt you. I've been in Sydney for three\r\ndays and I'm going back to Manaro.\" He informed the tollman that he\r\nhad taken a horse in Sydney, but that he was too old and stiff, so he\r\nhad taken the liberty of exchanging him for the one he had with him\r\nat Grose's Farm. \"Ain't you afraid of being took?\" asked the tollman.\r\nJackey laughed. \"I'd like to see who'll stop me while I've these little\r\nbull-dogs about me,\" he said, tapping his pistols. He stood chatting\r\nwhile he smoked regardless of the fact that Grose's Farm, now the\r\ngrounds of the Sydney University, was within a stone's-throw of the\r\ntollbar. He offered the tollman some money and asked him to go to the\r\npublic-house for some rum. The tollman replied, \"I can't leave the\r\nbar.\" \"All right,\" returned Jackey, \"then I'll get it myself.\" He went\r\naway to Toogood's Inn and returned in a few minutes with half-a-pint of\r\nrum. He gave some to the toll-keeper and took a stiff glass himself.\r\nThen he shook hands with the tollman, mounted his horse, and rode on\r\ntowards Parramatta.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of July a great commotion was caused in George Street,\r\nSydney, by a soldier arresting a well-dressed man and asserting that he\r\nrecognised him as Jackey Jackey. A large number of people assembled and\r\nthere were plenty of them quite ready to assist in the capture of the\r\nnoted bushranger. On the prisoner being taken to the police court proof\r\nwas soon forthcoming to show that he was a free man. He was discharged\r\nand the soldier was censured for being too officious. Since the visit\r\nof the bushranger in May had become known a constant look-out had been\r\nkept in case he should repeat his visit.\r\n\r\nJackey Jackey did not long maintain his freedom, however. He one day\r\nwent into Gray's Black Horse Inn on the Berrima road, called for some\r\nrefreshments, went into a sitting room, and threw himself on the sofa.\r\nHe was served by Miss Gray, and while he was drinking she pounced on\r\nhim and screamed. Her father and mother came to her assistance, but\r\nJackey Jackey fought with so much determination that he would no doubt\r\nhave got away. A carpenter named Waters was working near, however, and\r\nhearing the noise he rushed in and struck Jackey Jackey on the head\r\nwith his shingling hammer. Knocked senseless, the noted bushranger\r\nwas easily secured. It will be remembered that Gray's Black Horse Inn\r\nwas about three miles from Mulligan's farm, and was the place where\r\nLynch had bought the rum to treat Mr. and Mrs. Mulligan just before\r\nhe murdered them. The capture of Jackey Jackey was effected for the\r\npurpose of securing the reward of offered for him dead or alive. He\r\nwas tried for the robbery of the Boro store, and was sentenced to\r\npenal servitude for life. He was first confined in Darlinghurst Gaol,\r\nSydney, but being detected in an attempt to escape, he was transferred\r\nto Cockatoo Island at the mouth of the Parramatta River. While here\r\nhe organised a band of twenty-five prisoners, and made a desperate\r\nattempt to escape. The gang overcame and tied a warder, and then jumped\r\ninto the harbour with the intention of swimming to Balmain. The water\r\npolice, however, were apprised of the mutiny and captured the whole\r\ngang. It has been asserted that no prisoner has escaped from Cockatoo\r\nIsland. The distance from the island to the shore is not very great,\r\ncertainly less than half-a-mile to the nearest point, but all who have\r\ntried to swim it have either been retaken by the police or eaten by\r\nsharks.\r\n\r\nThe gang was tried for this attempt at escape and were sentenced to be\r\nsent to Port Arthur, Van Diemen's Land. Being such a desperate lot of\r\nscoundrels they were chained down in the hold of the brig, in which\r\nthey were forwarded, for safety; but, in spite of this precaution, they\r\ncontrived to get loose and were only prevented from capturing the brig\r\nby the hatches being put on and battened down. They reached Port Arthur\r\nin an almost suffocated condition, and were nearly starved, as they\r\nhad had no food for several days; the captain of the brig not daring\r\nto remove the hatches, either to let in air, or to pass food to the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nJackey Jackey succeeded in escaping from Port Arthur and immediately\r\nresumed his bushranging career. He was captured, however, after a\r\nvery short run and was sent to Glenorchy Probation Station for milder\r\ntreatment. Probably this attempt at reformation came too late, but\r\nhowever this may have been, it had little beneficial effect. Jackey\r\nJackey made his escape and again began bushranging. He was captured\r\nin a house in Hobart Town and was sentenced to death. The sentence,\r\nhowever, was commuted to penal servitude for life and he was sent to\r\nNorfolk Island, where we shall hear of him again later on.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Jackey Jackey's old mate, Paddy Curran, continued to\r\nrob as before. He went to Major Lockyer's station and entered the men's\r\nhut while they were having their Christmas dinner, in 1840. He had a\r\npair of handcuffs hanging at his belt, and was therefore thought to\r\nbe a constable out on the spree. He helped himself freely to the good\r\nthings on the table, and behaved generally so as to induce the idea\r\nthat he had been drinking. One of the men, however, said he did not\r\nbelieve that the visitor was \"a drunken trap,\" and Curran immediately\r\nknocked him down with the butt of his gun. The man jumped up at once\r\nand rushed at Curran. There was a struggle for a time, and the man\r\ngot Curran down. He was, however, too much exhausted to hold him, and\r\nCurran got up. The other men, who were all assigned servants on the\r\nestate, looked on and applauded the wrestlers, but not one of them\r\nmade any motion to assist his mate, otherwise Curran might easily have\r\nbeen captured. After his wrestling match Curran walked out of the hut,\r\nmounted his horse, and rode away. On the following day Curran again\r\nwent to the station, and found Mr. North, son-in-law to Major Lockyer,\r\nand another man in the store. He called on them to bail up, and both\r\nmen held their hands up. Curran was about to enter the store-door when\r\nhe was pinioned from behind. Mr. North and his store-keeper rushed\r\nforward, and after a severe struggle, during which the bushranger\r\ntried hard to get his gun free, he was captured and tied. The man who\r\nhad pinioned him was the man with whom he had had the wrestling match\r\nthe day before. Curran was taken to Goulburn for examination, and was\r\nremanded to Berrima to take his trial, \"where,\" said the _Port Phillip\r\nHerald_, \"it is to be hoped he will be more securely confined, and not\r\nallowed to escape, as he did before.\"\r\n\r\nPaddy Curran and James Berry, another bushranger, were sent to Berrima\r\nfor trial in charge of Constables McGuire and Wilsmore. They stopped at\r\na hut on the road for a rest and food. After they had finished their\r\nmeal Constable Wilsmore left the hut, and stayed away for some time. At\r\nlength Constable McGuire went to the door of the hut to call him, and\r\nBerry and Curran, taking advantage of his action, immediately rushed\r\nupon him. They were handcuffed together, and this no doubt hampered\r\ntheir movements. McGuire fought hard. The bushrangers had seized the\r\nguns, and each held one. McGuire endeavoured to wrest the gun from\r\nCurran with one hand, while he held Berry's gun off with the other\r\nhand. He yelled for Wilsmore, but Wilsmore did not come. At length\r\nBerry got his gun loose and shot McGuire in the back of the head and in\r\nthe shoulder. At this moment Constable Wilsmore returned, and seeing\r\nhis mate dead and the prisoners in possession of the guns, ran away\r\nagain. Curran and Berry beat McGuire about the head until he was dead,\r\nand a \"fearful spectacle to look upon.\" Then they searched his body,\r\nand finding the key of the handcuffs, released themselves and made off.\r\nThe two bushrangers continued their depredations for only a few months,\r\nhowever, as they were tracked down by the police and captured. Curran\r\nwas tried on September 15th, 1841, for the murder of Mr. Fuller. He\r\nafterwards confessed to this murder. He said he was in company with\r\ntwo other bushrangers on the road near Bungendore when he heard two\r\nmen quarrelling. Curran and his mates went towards the road and hid\r\nbehind trees. Presently two men, riding on one horse, came in sight\r\nand appeared to be having a dispute about something. They were talking\r\nloud and swearing at each other. Curran stepped out from behind the\r\ntree and called on them to stop. Instead of doing so they wheeled the\r\nhorse and began to gallop away. Curran fired and both men fell, while\r\nthe horse bolted along the road and soon got out of sight. One of the\r\nmen jumped up as soon as he fell and ran into the bush and they did not\r\nsee him again. The other man was Mr. Fuller, and he was either dead or\r\nat point of death. \"I turned him over and took about £11 in money and\r\na pocket knife out of his pockets,\" said the bushranger.\r\n\r\nCurran was also tried for having committed a rape on Mary Wilsmore.\r\nHe went to the hut occupied by Wilsmore on the 8th of February. It\r\nwas near Bungendore. He ordered Mrs. Wilsmore to get him some tea. A\r\nbushranger, named White, was with him. Mrs. Wilsmore went outside to\r\nget some wood to make up the fire and Curran followed her, knocked\r\nher down, and dragged her away to some scrub where he committed the\r\noffence. He was found guilty of both crimes and was sentenced to be\r\nhung. There were another case of rape, several cases of murder, and\r\nnumbers of robberies and burglaries charged against him, but none of\r\nthese were heard.\r\n\r\nJames Berry was tried for the murder of Constable McGuire, and was\r\nsentenced to death.\r\n\r\nAt the same sessions John Wright, another bushranger, was also\r\nsentenced to death. The case against him was as follows;--On May 17th,\r\n1840, Mrs. Margaret Foley, living at Long Swamp, about thirty miles\r\nfrom Bathurst, was going from her house into the detached kitchen\r\nat the rear, when three armed men appeared. She shouted \"Here's the\r\nbushrangers\" and ran into the kitchen. Mr. Cunningham, Mr. Foley's\r\npartner in the farm, came out of the house and fired both barrels of\r\nhis gun at the intruders, but failed to hit any of them. The leader of\r\nthe gang followed Mr. Cunningham, who went back into the house; and\r\nsaying, \"It'll be a long time before you and Steel (son of Captain\r\nSteel) hunt us again,\" shot him dead. Wright then went to the kitchen,\r\npushed the door open, and asked where Foley was? On being informed that\r\nhe had gone to Bathurst, he replied \"I'm sorry for it. I'd 'a served\r\nhim the same as Cunningham if I'd 'a caught him.\" He swung his gun\r\nabout in such a reckless manner that one of the assigned servants in\r\nthe kitchen requested him to be careful, adding \"Recollect that there\r\nare women and children here.\" Wright told him to mind his \"own----\r\nbusiness and be----\" to him. He continued to swear about Foley's\r\nabsence and declared that he'd a \"good mind to make a clean sweep.\"\r\nHe became cooler afterwards, and having collected all the jewellery\r\nand other valuables, went away. In passing sentence the Chief Justice\r\ncommented on the great number of robberies which had been committed by\r\nWright and his gang and said there was no hope of mercy. Wright thanked\r\nhis Honour and then coolly asked whether he might have a candle in his\r\ncell, as it was very dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  The Jewboy Gang; \"Come and Shoot the Bushrangers;\" Constable Refuses\r\n  to Leave His Work to Hunt Bushrangers; Saved by his Wife; Robberies\r\n  in Maitland; Bushrangers in High Hats; The Bullock-driver Captures\r\n  the Bushrangers; An Attempt to Reach the Dutch Settlements; Mr. E.D.\r\n  Day Captures the Gang; Assigned Servants' Attempt at Bushranging;\r\n  Some other Gangs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most notorious of the early bushrangers of Australia was\r\nEdward Davis, commonly known as The Jewboy. Next to Jackey Jackey and,\r\nperhaps, Mathew Brady, more yarns have been told about this hero of\r\nthe roads than of any other bushranger in the pre-gold digging era.\r\nThe Jewboy gang varied in numbers from time to time, no doubt from\r\nthe cause already noted in the cases of Mike Howe and Mathew Brady.\r\nNumbers of runaways joined the gang for a time and then returned to\r\nwhat was called civilisation, gave themselves up as ordinary runaways,\r\nand \"took their fifties like men.\" Others were shot or captured, and\r\neither hung or sent to a penal settlement to continue their careers\r\nthere. The Jewboy appears to have commenced his depredations in 1839 in\r\nwhat were then the northern districts of the colony of New South Wales.\r\nHis range extended from about Maitland to the New England ranges, he\r\nhaving taken possession of the Great Northern Road, but he was not\r\nparticular and, therefore, either he or other members of his gang, or,\r\nperhaps, independent bushrangers who were only supposed to belong to\r\nthe Jewboy gang, travelled considerable distances from the road. On\r\nJanuary 12th, 1839, Mr. Biddington's servant was stuck up and robbed\r\nnear Mr. Wightman's station on the Namoi River, some distance lower\r\ndown than Tamworth. The servant sent an invitation to Mr. Wightman to\r\n\"come and have a shot at the bushrangers.\" The _Sydney Gazette_, of\r\nApril 3rd, said: \"The country between Patrick's Plains and Maitland\r\nhas lately been the scene of numerous outrages by bushrangers. A party\r\nof runaway convicts, armed and mounted, have been scouring the roads\r\nin all directions. In one week they robbed no less than seven teams on\r\nthe Wollombi Road, taking away everything portable. They also went to\r\nMr. Nicholas's house, and carried away a great quantity of property\r\nafter destroying a great many articles which they did not want. Mr.\r\nMacdougall, late Chief Constable of Maitland, and a party of volunteers\r\nset out in pursuit. The Wollombi district constable is a tailor by\r\ntrade, and he refused to leave his work to accompany the party on the\r\nplea that it would not pay him.\" This reminds us that the ordinary\r\npolice force of the present day did not exist in Australia at that\r\ntime. In the larger towns there were paid constables and watchmen who\r\ndevoted their whole time to guarding the citizens and their property;\r\nbut, in country districts, a tradesman was paid a small sum per annum\r\nfor acting as constable. There was, however, a mounted patrol force\r\nwhich is frequently spoken of as a police force. The police duties in\r\nSydney, Parramatta, and other large towns were discharged by soldiers.\r\n\r\nMajor Sutton was stopped on the road by armed men, and robbed on his\r\nreturn from attending the Maitland police sessions, and a hut belonging\r\nto Mr. Windeyer, near Stroud, was broken into and robbed. Robberies\r\nwere very frequent about Maitland, and in the Upper Hunter and\r\nPatterson River districts, and these were all credited to the Jewboy\r\ngang, which was just coming into notoriety. On June 17th, 1839, four\r\nbushrangers were captured near Murrurundi. They had a black gin and a\r\nblack boy with them. These were supposed to be part of the gang which\r\nhad bailed up Lieutenant Caswell's place on the 9th. When challenged\r\nLieutenant Caswell refused to stand. One of the bushrangers fired at\r\nhim, but his wife rushed forward and struck up the barrel of the gun\r\nin time to save her husband's life. For doing this another of the gang\r\nknocked her down. They searched the place and took away about £400\r\nworth in money, jewellery, and other property. They held the road for\r\na day between Green Hills and Maitland, and robbed every person who\r\npassed. The next day they went to Mr. Simpson's house in West Maitland.\r\nA man employed there, however, fired at them, and they made off. On\r\nthe following day Mr. Michael Henderson was knocked down and robbed\r\nnear Wallis' Creek, on the road between East and West Maitland. Mr.\r\nCotham came up at the time and was seized, thrown down, and robbed.\r\nAs soon as news of these robberies were reported, Lieutenant Christie\r\nwith a party of mounted troopers started in pursuit. From Maitland the\r\ngang is supposed to have travelled northwards, and on the 15th Mr.\r\nFleming received a note requesting him to get up his horses early on\r\nthe following morning. Instead of complying with this insolent order,\r\nMr. Fleming sounded his men, and believing that he could trust them\r\ndistributed arms among them and stationed them at various advantageous\r\npoints. When the bushrangers arrived the men fired at them. The robbers\r\nreturned the fire and ran to a hut, which they took possession of. A\r\nregular siege ensued, and the black gin proved herself to be an expert\r\nin loading guns. She was said to have acted as guard over men bailed\r\nup, while the bushrangers were waiting to stop other travellers. The\r\nbushrangers were dressed as gentlemen in clothes which they had stolen\r\nfrom some of their victims. They were well armed and had plenty of\r\nmoney. One of them, Thomas Maguire, was said to be a free man.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1840, the Jewboy gang committed numberless\r\ndepredations. They robbed Mr. Deake's house at Wollombi, stole his\r\nhorses, took horses from several other stations, and held the roads at\r\nvarious places for a day at a time, and robbed every one who passed\r\nalong. The head-quarters of the gang were at Doughboy Hollow in the\r\nLiverpool Ranges, and it was said that any man riding along the road\r\nnear Murrurundi or Quirindi, or between these places and Tamworth,\r\nwas \"almost certain to lose his horse and whatever property he might\r\nhave about him, and be compelled to walk to the next stage and perhaps\r\nfurther, while the bushrangers were riding his horse to death harrying\r\nother honest people.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the stories told of the Jewboy was that he \"rounded up\" the\r\nchief constable of the district with a party of constables and\r\nvolunteers who had gone out to seek for him, and after having \"yarded\r\nthem like a mob of cattle,\" took their horses, arms, and whatever\r\nmoney they had, and rode away laughing. However, sometimes the tables\r\nwere turned on the bushranger. A bullock driver named Budge was bailed\r\nup by two of the gang. Budge had a little boy with him, and one of\r\nthe bushrangers stood over Budge and the child while the other was\r\nransacking the dray. Budge kept his eye on the sentry and, noticing him\r\nlook round to see how his mate was getting on, sprang on him, snatched\r\nthe pistol from his hand, and knocked him down. Then he ordered the\r\nother bushranger to get off his dray, and made the two stand side by\r\nside. He kept them standing thus for about two hours in hopes that some\r\ntravellers would pass along and assist him to take them to the nearest\r\nlock-up, but unfortunately no one came, and he was forced at length to\r\nlet them go. He, however, kept their arms and saddles, and these he\r\ndelivered to the Commissary on arriving at his destination. There were\r\ntwo guns and four pistols, all loaded. One of the saddles was owned by\r\nMr. Joliffe and was returned to him. In connection with this it is said\r\nthat Budge, when he was an assigned servant on Mr. Potter's Marquesas\r\nEstate, some years before, had bolted with six or seven other servants\r\non the estate, and started to walk northward with \"the hope of reaching\r\nthe Dutch settlements at Timour.\" They travelled for three days, during\r\nthe last forty-eight hours of which they had nothing to eat Budge\r\ntherefore left them and returned towards the Hunter River. He was so\r\nexhausted, however, for want of food, that he fell. He was discovered\r\nby a stockman who was out rounding up the cattle on the station. Budge\r\nwas taken into the station in a deplorable condition, and for a time\r\nwas not expected to live. He recovered, however, and continued to work\r\nin the district. Of his companions nothing was heard for some years,\r\nbut later, when the country northward was explored, remains were found\r\nwhich were believed to be theirs. From these it was conjectured that,\r\nafter Budge left, one man had been killed \"to save the lives of the\r\nothers.\" There was evidence that one man had been cut up, it was\r\nsupposed for food; but this had not saved the others. That at least is\r\nwhat the evidence pointed to. The remains had been so torn about by\r\ndingoes, crows, and hawks, as to make it impossible to identify them.\r\nThe bodies were scattered over a wide area, some of them being several\r\nmiles away from the others; and it is not even certain whether the\r\nwhole number were ever found.\r\n\r\nNine men were arrested in Sydney and charged with being runaways. Eight\r\nof them proved that they were free men, and the constable who arrested\r\nthem was censured. The case was cited as an instance of the arbitrary\r\ncharacter of the Bushranging Act. One of the men, however, proved to\r\nbe James Jackson, who had absconded from the estate of Mr. Turner, of\r\nMaitland. He was sent back to Maitland and convicted of bushranging,\r\nand was sent to penal servitude for life. He was said to have taken\r\npart in some of the robberies committed by the Jewboy gang, having been\r\nat large since the middle of 1840.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, September 26th, some of the gang bailed up the mail man\r\nbetween Muswellbrook and Patrick's Plains, and are supposed to have\r\ntaken some £250 from the letters. After this robbery one of them\r\nbolted from his mates, taking the greater part of the proceeds of\r\ntheir industry with him. He made his way to Sydney, where he passed\r\nhimself off for a time as a free immigrant. He was arrested under\r\nthe Bushrangers' Act and charged with being illegally at large. Then\r\nnews of the mail robbery reached Sydney, and the fellow was sent\r\nto Muswellbrook, where he was identified by the mail man, and was\r\nsentenced to penal servitude.\r\n\r\nThe gang afterwards went to Scone and stuck up Mr. Danger's store and\r\nMr. Chiver's Inn. The storeman in charge, named Graham, fired at the\r\nbushrangers and then ran for the soldiers, but one of the bushrangers\r\nfollowed him, and before he reached the watch-house, shot him dead.\r\nThey hastily made a bundle of such articles as took their fancy, and\r\nleft the town. They went to Captain Pike's station and seized the\r\noverseer, taking him with them. When they were far enough in the bush\r\nthey formed themselves into \"a court,\" and tried him \"for want of\r\nfeeling.\" He was found guilty and sentenced to receive three dozen\r\nlashes, \"which he got in good style.\"\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, December 21st, 1840, Captain Horsley, of Woodbury, Hexham,\r\non the Hunter River, about five miles from Maitland, was awakened\r\nand alarmed by the violent barking of his dogs. He rose twice during\r\nthe night and went out on to the verandah of the house, but could\r\nsee nothing. As the noise continued he went out for the third time,\r\nwhen three men rushed at him. They threatened him with their guns and\r\ncompelled him to surrender. They then took him back to his bedroom,\r\nmade him get into bed, lie down, and cover his face with a pillow.\r\nThe captain and Mrs. Horsley were told that if either of them moved,\r\nthey would both be shot instantly. The robbers demanded the keys, and\r\non being told where to find them they opened the drawers, cabinets,\r\nand cupboards, and made bundles of the clothes, jewellery, plate, and\r\nmoney. They collected all the guns and pistols in the house, using the\r\nmost violent and profane language during their search for plunder.\r\nIt is supposed that they were disturbed in their work, as they left\r\nvery suddenly and dropped two gold rings and two silver candlesticks\r\nin their flight; as these articles were picked up the following day\r\noutside the house. On hearing of this outrage, Mr. Edward Denny Day\r\nheaded the soldiers and followed the bushrangers. They received tidings\r\nof them at several points on the Great Northern Road, the robbers\r\nbailing up people as they went along. They crossed the Page River at\r\nMurrurundi and came up to the bushrangers near Doughboy Hollow. Here\r\nthe Jewboy made a stand. The fight was a desperate one, but ultimately\r\nthe bushrangers were beaten and Edward Davis (the Jewboy), John\r\nEverett, John Shea, Robert Chitty, James Bryant, and John Marshall were\r\ncaptured. Richard Glanvill, the remaining member of the gang, made his\r\nescape, but was so closely pursued that he was captured in the scrub on\r\nthe following day, the 24th December. They were tried and convicted and\r\nwere hung on March 16th, 1841.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1841, a public meeting was held in Maitland, and a vote\r\nof thanks was passed to Mr. E.D. Day for the service he had rendered\r\nthe district in ridding it of such a desperate lot of villains as\r\nthose which constituted the Jewboy gang. It was also resolved that a\r\nsubscription should be taken up with the object of presenting Mr. Day\r\nwith a handsome testimonial, and this was duly carried out. But the\r\ncapture of the chief members of this formidable gang by no means rid\r\nthe northern district of bushrangers, although no doubt it paved the\r\nway towards that desirable end. Of those who remained it is impossible\r\nto say whether they were members of this gang or not. Some of them\r\nhad no doubt acted with it occasionally, while others may have always\r\noperated independently, though many of their depredations were credited\r\nto the gang by the public.\r\n\r\nCharles Vaut and Henry Steele, two of the assigned servants of Mr.\r\nGeorge Furber, worked in the field all day on Saturday, April 24th,\r\n1841, and were seen in the kitchen at eight o'clock at night. On the\r\nfollowing Sunday evening the Rev. John Hill Garvan, residing at Hull\r\nHill, four miles from Maitland, was sitting at tea just after sunset,\r\nwhen two men came to the door, presented their guns at him, and said,\r\n\"Don't stir.\" Mrs. Garvan was so much alarmed that she nearly fainted,\r\nand Mr. Garvan asked that she might be allowed to retire to the\r\nbedroom. \"Sit still,\" cried the robber, \"or I'll blow your brains out\r\nand put your wife on the fire.\" Mr. Garvan then struck the smaller man,\r\nVaut, who was nearest to him, and he snapped his gun at the minister,\r\nbut it missed fire. The bigger man then ordered Mrs. Garvan to \"go and\r\nsit on the fire.\" \"Oh, don't, pray don't, make me sit on the fire,\"\r\ncried the poor woman, but the ruffian took her by the shoulders and\r\nforced her back on to the burning logs. At that moment a dray was heard\r\ncoming along the road, and Steele let her go. She was more frightened\r\nthan hurt, but her stockings were scorched. The two men then ran away,\r\nand went back to their beds at Mr. Furber's. They were arrested on the\r\nfollowing day by Chief Constable George Wood, of Maitland. A pistol was\r\nfound under the sheet of bark which served them for a bedstead. When\r\nbrought up for trial, Judge Stephen (afterwards Sir Alfred Stephen),\r\nsaid the law of England on burglary made no provision for such an\r\noutrage as this, committed in a dwelling before nine o'clock. If they\r\nwere convicted they could not be sentenced to more than fifteen years'\r\nimprisonment. The jury found them guilty, and they were sentenced to\r\nthe term mentioned. They were afterwards charged with shooting at Mr.\r\nGarvan with intent to do grievous bodily harm, and were found guilty\r\nand sentenced to transportation to a penal settlement for life. It is\r\nmore than probable that these men, and many others like them, assisted\r\nthe bushrangers whenever an opportunity occurred--that is, when the\r\nbushrangers operated in the neighbourhood in which they were assigned\r\nservants, but without actually becoming members of the gang. There was\r\na sort of freemasonry among the convicts which impelled them to assist\r\neach other in their war against society, and even in cases where it\r\nwas obviously to their interests to stand by and assist their masters,\r\ntheir sympathies with the bushrangers and their hatred of all forms\r\nof authority impelled them irresistibly to take the opposite side, to\r\ntheir own individual detriment. But the principal gang having been\r\nbroken up in this district, robberies of the kind described gradually\r\nceased, and it was some years before this district was again disturbed\r\nas it had been. In other districts, however, the bushrangers were still\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nMr. Michel, of Kurraducbidgee, was travelling to Port Phillip in\r\nFebruary, 1840. He went into an inn near Yass for food and refreshment\r\nand found the place in the hands of the bushrangers. Fourteen men were\r\nbailed up and Michel was compelled to take his place in line against\r\nthe wall of the bar. The bushrangers handed him a pannikin full of\r\ntea before they took his money. Knowing what was coming, he held the\r\npannikin as if the tea was too hot to drink and, when the bushranger\r\nin charge was looking away, dropped his roll of bank notes into it. He\r\nstood very quietly and when the bushranger came to feel his pockets\r\nthere were only a few shillings in them. They appeared to be quite\r\nsatisfied and, on his saying that he had important business to attend\r\nto, he was allowed to go. He carried the pannikin out with him, took\r\nthe money out and put it in his pocket without being observed, and\r\nthrew the tea away. Then he mounted his horse, rode to the nearest\r\npolice station and gave information. The police started for the hotel\r\nimmediately, but the robbers had decamped and no information could be\r\nobtained as to the direction in which they had gone.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hutchinson, who had run away from the prisoners' barracks at\r\nHyde Park, Sydney, in July, 1836, was captured on June 28th, 1840, at\r\nthe corner of Market and George Streets. He had been out with a gang in\r\nthe Windsor district and a reward of £25 had been offered for him.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1841, six armed men called at the lock-up at Appin, and\r\nasked Constable Laragy who was in charge to put them on the right road\r\nfor Campbelltown. They said that they had come from Kings Falls. The\r\nconstable stepped back for his gun, when one of them presented his gun\r\nat Laragy and told him not to be a fool. They didn't want to hurt him.\r\nAs there was no one there to assist him he answered \"All right,\" and\r\nshowed them the road, which they probably knew as well as he did. It\r\nwas said that this was merely a _ruse de guerre_ to let the police know\r\nthat they were out.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, October 24th, 1841, a man entered the house of a soldier\r\nin Parramatta and offered to pay half-a-crown for a night's lodging.\r\nThe offer was accepted, but the host afterwards, noticing that his\r\nlodger carried pistols, became suspicious and went to the police\r\nstation. A constable accompanied him back and identified the lodger as\r\na bushranger who \"was wanted.\" It was said that he had stuck up Mr.\r\nFrazer and several other persons just outside the town. The constable\r\nmade an attempt to seize him and was promptly knocked down. The\r\nbushranger ran towards the river, and was followed and caught after a\r\nsevere struggle. He walked quietly back towards the lock-up until he\r\ncame to the corner of Macquarie Street, when suddenly wrenching himself\r\nfree from the two men who were holding his arms, he exclaimed \"This is\r\nmy road,\" and \"bolted.\" He was seen two days later at Longbottom, about\r\nhalf-way between Parramatta and Sydney, and was chased, but succeeded\r\nin eluding capture in the scrub at Five Dock.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1842, the house of Mr. Gray in Balmain was stuck up. The\r\nbushrangers collected the watches, rings, money, and other valuables,\r\nand then compelled Mr. and Mrs. Gray and the servants to drink\r\ntumblers full of sherry wine to their success. They were very merry,\r\nand drank Mr. and Mrs. Gray's healths. When they departed they took\r\na dozen and a half of sherry and a dozen of bottled ale with them to\r\n\"have a spree in the bush.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same month Colonel and Mrs. Gwynne, Major Woore, and Mr.\r\nThomas Woore, J.P., with the Chief Constable of Goulburn, and another\r\nconstable, were driving near Bargo Brush. The party was in two\r\ncarriages, with the constable on horseback. They were stopped by a gang\r\nwhich it was said had just robbed the Goulburn mail. The constable\r\non horseback was the only one of the party who carried a gun, and he\r\nbolted as soon as the bushrangers appeared, dropping his musket. The\r\nrobbers took £11 14s. and the gun, but after holding a consultation\r\namong themselves they returned three one-pound notes and the fourteen\r\nshillings so that \"the gentlemen might drink their healths.\" Then,\r\nwishing the party good-day, they departed.\r\n\r\nIn January, William Gunn and John South were arrested as runaways\r\nfrom the station at Port Macquarie. It was said that they had been at\r\nlarge for more than a year and had been with the Jewboy. They robbed\r\nthe northern mail near Scone and were followed and captured. They wore\r\nblack coats and vests, beaver hats and clean white shirts, \"as if they\r\nhad just come from an inn or a gentleman's residence.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1842, John Wilkinson alias Wilton escaped from Towrang\r\nstockade, carrying away with him Captain Christy's double-barrelled\r\ngun and a fowling piece. He was joined by another runaway named John\r\nMorgan, and on March 10th they took possession of the Sydney Road\r\nnear Berrima and bailed up every person who passed. They plundered\r\nseveral drays and stopped the mail-man. They searched the mail bags,\r\nbut finding no money in the letters, they permitted the mail-man to\r\ngather them up and proceed on his journey. They took seven pounds from\r\na passenger named Jones, but on his saying that he would have no money\r\nto pay for his board and lodging while in Sydney, they returned him\r\ntwo pounds. At Red Bank they stole a horse belonging to Mr. Post to\r\ncarry their plunder. Further along the road towards Sydney, they met a\r\ntrooper and a constable, and told them that they were in pursuit of a\r\nwoman who had run away from her husband and had taken his spring cart\r\nand horse and some of his property. They pretended that they expected\r\nto overtake her before she reached Liverpool. At Crisp's Inn they had\r\nsome champagne. Not far from there, still going towards Sydney, they\r\ntried to bail up Dr. McDonald, but he rode away. They fired at him but\r\nfailed to overtake him. They slept that night in the little church\r\nat Camden. The following day they rode straight into Sydney, put up\r\nat a first-class hotel and remained there for several days, \"living\r\nlike gentlemen.\" By some means, however, they excited the suspicions\r\nof the police and became alarmed at the enquiries made about them.\r\nThey therefore left suddenly and returned towards Berrima. Mr. Post,\r\nwho had been away from home when his horse was stolen, started out in\r\ncompany with his son-in-law, Tom Howarth, to follow the bushrangers.\r\nThe rapidity of their motions, however, threw him off the scent. On\r\ntheir return to the district in which he lived he met them and tried\r\nto bail them up, but the bushrangers rode away. The following day\r\nChief-Constable Hildebrand, of Stone Quarry, and Tom Howarth saw the\r\nbushrangers near Bargo Brush. Hildebrand pretended to be drunk, and\r\nrolled about on his horse as if he was going to fall off, and Howarth\r\nstarted singing to heighten the illusion. This put the bushrangers off\r\ntheir guard and they allowed the constable to come close up. As soon\r\nas he was near enough Hildebrand pulled out his pistol and called upon\r\nthem to surrender. They were taken by surprise and yielded at once.\r\nHowarth boasted that these two made eighteen bushrangers whom he had\r\nhelped to capture. The two men were tried at Berrima, and sentenced\r\nto penal servitude for life. They narrowly escaped being charged with\r\nmurder, as one of the bullock drivers stuck up on the 10th had been\r\nseverely wounded for forcibly resisting the ransacking of his dray. He\r\nrecovered, however.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison, a jeweller and watchmaker, of Sydney, went to Glen Rock,\r\nand walked from thence to Berrima, to call on the settlers along the\r\nroad to solicit orders. He was bailed up by three men, who threatened\r\nto cut his throat with a razor. They tied his handkerchief over his\r\neyes, took three £1 notes, a cheque for £1, and an order for £10 from\r\nhis pockets. They returned the order saying it was \"no---- good to\r\nthem.\" A bullock driver and another traveller were bailed up, and then\r\nthe bushrangers went into the road to stop a gig, and Mr. Harrison\r\nbolted into the bush.\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell was travelling along the Dog Trap Road when he was\r\nbailed up by three men and robbed. He returned to Parramatta and gave\r\ninformation to Chief Constable Ryan, who dressed in private clothes\r\nand with another constable similarly disguised started to drive along\r\nthe road in Mr. Campbell's gig. Between Anlezack's Inn and Liverpool\r\nthree men came out from behind trees and called on the constables to\r\nstand. Ryan immediately pulled up, and presenting his pistol at the men\r\ncalled on them to surrender in the Queen's name. The other constable\r\njumped out of the gig and also presented his pistol, and the robbers\r\ncapitulated. They were identified as John McCann and William Lynch,\r\nescapees from Norfolk Island, who had landed from a whale boat some\r\nmonths previously, and James O'Donnell, alias William McDonald, who\r\nhad absconded from the Hyde Park Barracks a short time before, in\r\nSeptember, 1842. A considerable amount of property was recovered when\r\ntheir camp was searched.\r\n\r\nMr. F.E. Bigge, a settler in the northern district, started to take a\r\ndrove of horses across the country to Moreton Bay. He was assisted by\r\nAlexander McDonald and two assigned servants. When between Schofield's\r\nand Brennan's stations, near Tamworth, they were called upon to halt\r\nby three armed men, known as Wilson, Long Tom or Coxen's Tom, and Long\r\nNed. The order was obeyed, and then Mr. Bigge was ordered to strip.\r\nHe refused, and one of the bushrangers called to another of them to\r\nknock him down with the butt of his gun; but, observing that Mr. Bigge\r\nwas trying to get his pistol out of his belt, he fired. The first shot\r\nwas said to have been fired by Long Tom, but Wilson fired immediately\r\nafterwards and wounded Bigge in the shoulder. McDonald, having no\r\narms, rode away to Schofield's for assistance. In the meantime Bigge\r\nsucceeded in getting his pistol out of his belt and fired at the\r\nnearest bushranger, who fired in return, the other two also firing.\r\nBigge drew his second pistol and fired, and the bushrangers having\r\nexpended their ammunition ran away. Bigge then mounted and rode to\r\nBrennan's. Finding no one there he went on, and his horse bolted\r\nand threw him. He then walked to Nillenga, where he found Dr. Jay,\r\nwho dressed his wounds, which were not considered dangerous. In the\r\nmeantime, McDonald, when he started to go to Schofield's, met Mr. Kayes\r\nand another gentleman, but they refused to go with him to assist Bigge.\r\nMcDonald went on to the station, but not being able to obtain any arms\r\nor assistance there, he rode back again, and found the bushrangers'\r\nhorses and some baggage, which they had left behind when Mr. Bigge\r\nput them to flight. McDonald collected the horses, which had been\r\nscattered, and drove them to Tamworth, where Mr. Allman soon organised\r\na large party to go in pursuit of the bushrangers. Wilson had been\r\ncaptured by Mr. Robertson only a few weeks before and had been sent to\r\nthe chain gang at Maitland, from whence he had effected his escape.\r\nThey were all three caught and were sent to penal servitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  Bushranging in South Australia; The Robbers Captured in Melbourne;\r\n  A Remarkable Raid in Port Phillip; Going Out for a Fight with\r\n  Bushrangers; A Bloody Battle; Cashan and McIntyre; The Fight with\r\n  the Mail Passengers; Cashan Escapes from the Lock-up; Is Recaptured;\r\n  McIntyre Caught at Gammon Plains.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree bushrangers named Wilson, Green, and another, robbed the settlers\r\nin the vicinity of Lyndoch Valley, South Australia, and extorted\r\nheavy contributions from their victims in the latter part of the year\r\n1839 and the beginning of 1840. These robberies had been going on for\r\nsome months before news of them reached Adelaide. The colony had been\r\nonly founded a little more than three years before, and communication\r\nwas difficult and very irregular. There were no roads and the police\r\nprovisions were not yet of a character to enable the authorities to\r\ncope effectually with such an outbreak as this.\r\n\r\nThe robbers called at Mr. Read's station and knocked at the door of the\r\nhouse. The woman opened the door and was immediately knocked down by\r\none of the robbers without any notice being given or question asked.\r\nAnother robber fired his musket at her at so close range that the\r\nwadding of the gun bruised her cheek, but the slugs with which it was\r\nloaded did not injure her. Immediately on hearing of this outrage,\r\nMr. Inman, superintendent of the police, left Adelaide with a party\r\nof mounted troopers, and as he proceeded on his way, news of other\r\nrobberies were spread about. The movements of the police, however,\r\nappear to have been known to the bushrangers, as they were fired at\r\nwhen passing through some scrub. Not knowing how many men there might\r\nbe in the gang, Mr. Inman intrenched himself, and sent to Adelaide for\r\nmore men, and in a few days parties of mounted police arrived from\r\nGawler and Mount Barker. The district was thoroughly searched, but\r\nwithout success. About the middle of February, three men on horseback\r\narrived in Melbourne, Port Phillip. Their principal place of resort\r\nwas the Royal Highlander Inn, in Queen Street, where they spent money\r\nfreely and drank heavily. One of the men was recognised by the police\r\nas a convict from Van Diemen's Land, free by service. He was arrested\r\non suspicion of having stolen the horse he rode, from Mr. Cox, but\r\nas Mr. Cox's superintendent could not swear to the animal, although\r\nhe bore the station brand, the man was discharged and immediately\r\nleft Melbourne. On Sunday, February 23rd, Wilson was arrested for\r\ndrunkenness and rowdyism, and was fined 5s. next morning at the police\r\ncourt. While there he was seen and recognised by two South Australian\r\npolicemen who had been to Sydney with some prisoners, and were on\r\ntheir way home. Wilson and Green were both arrested that evening and\r\ncharged with the robbery at Mr. Read's station, South Australia. They\r\nwere detained until warrants could be obtained from Adelaide, when they\r\nwere sent there and convicted. The robbers had travelled from South\r\nAustralia to Melbourne, _via_ Portland Bay, and had probably stolen\r\nthe horses and perhaps some other property on the road. The third man,\r\nwhose name is not given, was searched for, but was not found, and it\r\nwas supposed he had crossed the Murray into New South Wales.\r\n\r\nWhat is generally said to be the first highway robbery in the Port\r\nPhillip district took place in April, 1842. A gang, composed of John\r\nEllis, _alias_ Yanky Jack, Jack Williams, Young Fogarty, and a \"Van\r\nDemonian\" named Jepps, bailed up Mr. Darling and a friend as they were\r\nriding to an out-station on the Dandenong run to brand cattle. The\r\nrobbers took £2 and a silver watch from Mr. Darling, and one shilling\r\nand sixpence from his friend. Mr. Darling was riding a thorough-bred\r\nhorse, and Jack Williams remarked that he was a fine beast, and ordered\r\nMr. Darling to show off his paces. This was a blunder on the part\r\nof the bushranger, who should have tried the horse himself, and Mr.\r\nDarling was not slow in taking advantage of it. He did not wish to lose\r\nhis horse, and therefore jerked the bit, rolled about in the saddle,\r\nand pretended that he had as much as he could do to keep his seat while\r\nthe horse was cantering. Williams watched as the horse went past him\r\na couple of times, and then said, \"That'll do. He seems to be a----\r\nrough 'un.\" He contented himself with the horse the friend was riding,\r\ngiving him his knocked-up horse in exchange. The bushrangers handed Mr.\r\nDarling his watch, asked for it again, and returned it a second time\r\nafter passing it round for each to look at. Then as the gang was going\r\naway Williams turned back, asked Mr. Darling to let him see what the\r\ntime was, and when that gentleman again showed him the watch he took it\r\nand put it into his pocket. He then produced a bottle of rum, and after\r\nhaving taken a swig himself passed it to Mr. Darling and his friend\r\nwith the remark that \"a drop of grog was good on a cold day.\" Then\r\nhe took five shillings from his pocket, gave this also to Darling to\r\n\"drink their healths with at the next public-house,\" said \"good day,\"\r\nand rode on after his mates. The gang went along the main road up the\r\nPlenty River robbing the stations on either side of the road as they\r\ncame to them. They stuck up Messrs. Serjeantson, Peet, Bond, Langor,\r\nMarsh, Fleming, Rider, Bear, and Captain Harrison, collecting a goodly\r\nassortment of watches and chains, mostly silver, and some money. It was\r\nafter dark when they finished at Mr. Bear's house, and they camped by\r\nthe creek within sight of the house for the night.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning the gang took to the road again and robbed Messrs.\r\nSherwin, Roland, and Wills. At about nine o'clock they reached Mr.\r\nCampbell Hunter's station as the family was sitting down to a breakfast\r\nof roast duck, kippered herrings, and coffee. Williams walked into the\r\nroom pistol in hand and cried, \"Put up your hands.\" He was immediately\r\nobeyed. Then looking round he said \"Gentlemen, you must make room for\r\nyour betters.\" Those present were Messrs. Campbell Hunter, Alexander\r\nHunter, Streatham, Rumbold, Boswell, and Dr. Grimes. They were made to\r\nstand up against the wall while the roast ducks and other good things\r\nwere removed to a slab hut used as a store room. The bushrangers had,\r\nhowever, only just begun their breakfast when a large party of armed\r\nmen galloped up.\r\n\r\nNews of the robberies of the previous day had reached Melbourne in the\r\nevening, and Messrs. P. Snodgrass and H. Fowler, of the Melbourne Club,\r\nhad resolved to \"go out for a hunt.\" They got their arms and horses,\r\nand started, and were joined by several other gentlemen, among whom\r\nwere Mr. Serjeantson, and others who had been robbed, to the number\r\nof about thirty. The bushrangers hastily made the Messrs. Hunter and\r\ntheir other prisoners promise not to take part in the coming fight,\r\nand then took up positions behind the fence. Undeterred by this show\r\nof resistance, Mr. Gourlay jumped his horse over the fence, alighting\r\nclose to Jack Williams, so close, in fact, that the flash from the\r\nbushranger's pistol, which was fired immediately, singed his whiskers\r\nand burned his cheek. The bushranger dashed his pistol down on the\r\nground with an oath, and drew another, but Mr. Snodgrass, leaning\r\nover the fence, shot him in the head before he could make use of it.\r\nThinking he had killed his man, Snodgrass turned to Yanky Bill, when\r\nWilliams jumped up and fired point blank at Gourlay, who shouted,\r\n\"Tell my friends I died game,\" and fell. Mr. Chamberlain shot Williams\r\nthrough the head and killed him. Much to the surprise of those near,\r\nMr. Gourlay jumped up again almost as quickly as he had fallen, and it\r\nwas soon discovered that the pistol bullet had smashed his powder flask\r\nand glanced off, inflicting only a severe bruise.\r\n\r\nOn the death of their leader the bushrangers rushed to the hut, and\r\ntook shelter there, pointing their pistols through the openings between\r\nthe slabs, and a fierce fusilade took place, during which Mr. Fowler\r\nwas severely wounded. Then there was a pause. It was believed that\r\nthe ammunition of the robbers had been expended, and a horse dealer\r\nresiding in the neighbourhood, named John Ewart, but usually known as\r\nHoppy Jack, volunteered to go in and speak to the bushrangers. At first\r\nthis was objected to as being too dangerous, but Hoppy Jack insisted,\r\nand said it would be \"all right.\" He advanced towards the hut waving\r\na white handkerchief, and after a few words at the door was admitted.\r\nThe result of this embassy was that the bushrangers agreed to surrender\r\nprovided that their captors would sign a petition to the judge to deal\r\nleniently with them. This was readily agreed to, and the men came out\r\nand gave themselves up just as a party of mounted police appeared on\r\nthe scene, and the prisoners were handed over to them.\r\n\r\nThis raid was principally remarkable for the boldness and rapidity with\r\nwhich it was executed. The bushrangers travelled directly from one\r\nstation to the next, taking the shortest route, which was generally\r\nalong the main road. The robberies were effected in very short time\r\nat each station, the bushrangers contenting themselves with money,\r\nwatches, rings, and other property carried on the person. There was\r\nno time wasted in breaking open boxes or drawers, and there was no\r\nnecessity to spare their horses, as a knocked-up horse could be\r\nexchanged for a fresh one almost whenever the robbers pleased. Mr.\r\nGourlay was little the worse for his bruises and burns, although the\r\npowder marks on his face remained, but Mr. Fowler died a few days after\r\nthe fight. The prisoners were tried and convicted, and in spite of the\r\nrecommendation to mercy duly signed by their captors and forwarded to\r\nthe judge, were sentenced to death for the murder of Mr. Fowler. Jepps\r\nconfessed that it was he who had fired the fatal shot, but he also said\r\nthat he had refused to join in an attempt to murder Judge Willis, the\r\nresident judge in Port Phillip. They were all hung in Melbourne, in\r\nMay, 1842.\r\n\r\nDuring the following two years there was little bushranging in any part\r\nof New South Wales, but in 1844 McIntyre and Cashan, alias Nowlan,\r\nheld the roads between Hartley, Bathurst, and Mudgee for several days,\r\nrobbing all who passed. On December 2, 1845, they stopped the mail at\r\nBowenfels, on the main Sydney road at the foot of the Blue Mountains,\r\non the western side. They called on the passengers to hand over their\r\nmoney and valuables, but two of them resisted and drew their pistols.\r\nA fight took place, and the bushrangers were worsted, Cashan being\r\ncaptured, while McIntyre ran away into the bush. Cashan was taken\r\nto Bathurst, tried, convicted, and sentenced to be transported for\r\nlife. He was being taken to Sydney, in April, to be sent to Cockatoo\r\nIsland, when the escort stopped at Weatherboard Hut for the night,\r\nCashan being lodged in the lock-up. He broke out during the night,\r\nand could nowhere be found. He travelled to Gundagai, where he stuck\r\nup Mr. Nicholson's station, taking clothes, provisions, horse, saddle,\r\nand bridle. Mr. Andrews, who was in charge of the station, and who\r\nwas absent when Cashan called, on hearing of the robbery followed the\r\nbushranger. He rode to Charles Simpson's station, but was told by\r\nMessrs. Edwin and Alfred Tompson, who resided there, that no bushranger\r\nhad been seen. While they were talking a man on horseback came in\r\nsight, and Andrews recognised him as the robber from the description\r\nthat had been given of him and the horse he was riding. Andrews\r\nretreated into the house out of sight, and Cashan rode up, dismounted,\r\nand asked for refreshments, but he was immediately seized by the\r\nTompsons and told that he was a prisoner. He asked, \"How dared they\r\ninsult a gentleman in that manner,\" and struggled hard to escape; but,\r\nfinding that this was no use, he became quiet, and said he was ready\r\nto go wherever they wished him to. They took him towards the house,\r\nwhich was only a few steps distant, when suddenly he broke away with a\r\nlaugh, ran down the bank, and plunged into the Murrumbidgee River. The\r\nriver was in flood at the time, and was therefore twice its ordinary\r\nwidth, and running strongly. Cashan, encumbered with a great coat, and\r\nperhaps with other stolen property, could make no headway against the\r\ncurrent. He sank at once, rose some distance lower down, and succeeded\r\nin grasping the pendulous branches of a swamp oak (_Casuarina_) hanging\r\nover the water. After a severe struggle he contrived to haul himself\r\nout of the water, and took a seat in the fork of the tree. He was still\r\non the same side of the river as Simpson's station, and at no great\r\ndistance from the bank, although the flood waters prevented Alfred\r\nand Edwin Tompson from getting close to him. However, Edwin Tompson\r\ncovered him with his pistol, and threatened to shoot him if he moved.\r\nThey talked for some time, and the bushranger, seeing no chance of\r\nescape, agreed to give himself up. He dropped into the water, swam to\r\nthe bank, and walked quietly to the house, where he was tied and made\r\nsecure for the night. The next day he was taken to Yass by the Tompsons\r\nand Andrews, and in spite of his frequent attempts to break the\r\nhandcuffs and make his escape, he was safely lodged in the lock-up.\r\nHe was identified as one of the men who had burned Dr. Bell's house at\r\nBraidwood, and robbed the Braidwood mail. When robbing the Braidwood\r\nmail in company with McIntyre, he nearly committed murder, one of\r\nthe passengers having been dangerously wounded. He was convicted and\r\nsentenced to be hung.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, his former partner had not been idle. On the 21st\r\nApril, 1846, the two brothers Cutts were travelling towards Sydney with\r\na number of horses, when they were stopped at Meadow Flat, less than a\r\nquarter of a-mile from Howard's Inn. They were compelled to dismount,\r\nplace their money on the ground, and retire. They deposited £3 18s.\r\nin notes and silver and a watch on the ground, and then stepped back\r\nseveral paces as they had been ordered to do. William Cutts begged\r\nthat a seal attached to his watch might be returned to him, as it\r\nwas a present from his dead wife, and he valued it accordingly. The\r\nbushranger, who was supposed to be McIntyre, told him that \"if there\r\nwas any more palaver\" he would get his brains blown out. The robber\r\ntook up the money and watch, mounted his horse, and rode away. As soon\r\nas information of the robbery was received in Bathurst the mounted\r\ntroopers started in pursuit of the bushranger.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, August 11th, two men went to the Golden Fleece Inn, Gammon\r\nPlains, and remained drinking till Friday. On that day the landlord,\r\nMr. Perfrement, received his copy of the _Maitland Mercury_, and saw\r\nin it a list of the numbers of the bank notes recently stolen from\r\nthe Singleton mail. He compared the numbers with those of the notes\r\nhe had received from his two guests, and finding that some of them\r\ncorresponded, he went to the police station and gave information. The\r\ninn was not a large building, but there were several out-houses and\r\nthe bushrangers were in some of these. Perfrement and the police went\r\nto one of these huts at the rear of the inn and found McIntyre there.\r\nPerfrement put his hand on the bushranger's shoulder and said \"You're\r\na prisoner.\" \"Am I,\" exclaimed McIntyre jumping backwards, \"Come on.\"\r\nConstable Barker rushed in and a fierce wrestling match begun and\r\nlasted for some minutes. Then McIntyre got on top and tried to get\r\nhis pistol out from his belt. Mr. Perfrement, who had snatched the\r\nother pistol from him when the wrestling first began, now threatened\r\nto shoot him if he did not surrender, but as the bushranger took no\r\nnotice Perfrement endeavoured to twist the other pistol out of his\r\nhand. While this struggle was going on Barker wriggled from under the\r\nbushranger, got up, and struck him so heavily with his fist as to\r\nstun him. McIntyre lay still for several minutes before he regained\r\nconsciousness, and by that time his hands were tied. His companion\r\nwas found fast asleep in another hut and was easily captured. They\r\nwere tried in Maitland, and McIntyre was subsequently hung, while his\r\ncompanion was sent to penal servitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  Bushrangers and Pirates; Capture of H.M. Brig _Cyprus_ by\r\n  Bushrangers; A Piratical Voyage; Stealing the Schooners _Edward_ and\r\n  _Waterwitch_; Mutiny of Prisoners on H.M. Brig _Governor Phillip_ at\r\n  Norfolk Island; The Trial of the Mutineers at Sydney; How Captain\r\n  Boyle Recaptured the Vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe connection between bushranging and piracy may not at first seem\r\nvery apparent, but the bushrangers stole more than one vessel, and\r\nstarted a career of crime on the high seas instead of on the high\r\nroads, and our story of the bushrangers would be incomplete were\r\nno reference made to thefts of vessels and boats, and their use as\r\nvehicles for robbery. It is not very surprising that so many convicts\r\nmade their escapes from Macquarie Harbour, Port Arthur, and Norfolk\r\nIsland, in whale boats which they stole, long as the voyages made\r\nwere. The whale boat has played a conspicuous part in Australian\r\nexploration. Lieutenant Bass made his memorable voyage from Sydney,\r\nwhen he discovered the straits which bear his name, in a whale boat in\r\nwhich he started to explore the coast. Flinders and many others also\r\nmade long voyages and many discoveries in whale boats; for the Pacific,\r\nthe largest of the oceans of the world, however stormy it may be at\r\ntimes, fully deserves the name bestowed upon it by early navigators,\r\nfor several months in the year. Hence a voyage in a whale boat from\r\nNorfolk Island or from Van Diemen's Land is not so dangerous as the\r\ndistance to be travelled might suggest. We know that even now it is\r\nno very uncommon occurrence for convicts to steal boats and sail or\r\nrow from New Caledonia to some part of the coast of Australia, and\r\nwe know also that the Australians have at times entertained no very\r\nfriendly feelings towards France for persisting in maintaining a\r\npenal settlement so near their shores. It is not with the capture of\r\nwhale or ships' boats that we now have to deal, but with the seizure\r\nof larger vessels. In August, 1829, the Government brig _Cyprus_,\r\ncommanded by Captain Harris, left Hobart Town for Macquarie Harbour\r\nwith thirty-three convicts on board, the crew consisting of twelve,\r\nincluding the Commander, and there were also some soldiers under the\r\ncommand of Lieutenant Carew, and some women and children, numbering\r\neleven altogether. The brig put into Research Bay on the south coast of\r\nthe island, and anchored, but a gale arose and the brig was driven from\r\nher moorings, and lost her anchor and cable. She put back to Hobart\r\nTown, obtained a fresh anchor, and started again. On reaching Research\r\nBay she was again anchored, and the anchor and cable lost a few days\r\nbefore were recovered. At about six in the evening, while the men on\r\nboard were having supper, Lieutenant Carew, Dr. Williams, a soldier,\r\nand Popjoy (the coxswain), with two or three convicts, started in the\r\nlong boat to catch some fish. They had not rowed very far when they\r\nheard shouting and some shots on board the brig, and Lieutenant Carew\r\nexclaimed: \"Oh, my God! The convicts have taken the ship.\" They pulled\r\nback as rapidly as possible, and Carew tried to climb on board, but\r\nwas threatened with a musket by one of the prisoners. When the trigger\r\nwas pulled the gun flashed in the pan and Carew again tried to get on\r\nboard, but was pushed back into the boat. He then asked the convicts\r\nwho were clustered round to give him his wife and children, and these\r\nwere passed into the boat. Mrs. Williams, her servant, and the wives\r\nof a couple of the soldiers were also put into the boat. It appears\r\nthat when the long boat left there were only Captain Harris and two\r\nsoldiers on deck, the rest of the crew and passengers being below at\r\nsupper. Suddenly five heavily ironed prisoners made a rush, and knocked\r\ndown the captain and two sentinels. Others rushed to the hatchway,\r\nand began to put the hatches on, when the soldiers and crew, fearing\r\nthat they would be suffocated, agreed to surrender. They gave up their\r\narms, and as they came on deck they were conducted to one of the boats,\r\nin which several prisoners who had had their irons taken off seated\r\nthemselves at the oars. Popjoy was compelled to go on board, as it was\r\nsaid his services would be required for navigating the vessel. Then the\r\ncaptain, the lieutenant, and doctor, with the women, the soldiers, and\r\nthe crew, were rowed to an island in the bay and landed. Seventeen of\r\nthe prisoners were also landed, the mutineers only numbering sixteen\r\nof those on board. The boats were hoisted in, the sails lowered, and\r\nthe ship got under way. But as she started Popjoy jumped overboard and\r\nswam ashore. As the brig went down the bay the men on board shouted\r\n\"Hooray! the ship's our own, hooray!\" The captain and others landed on\r\nthe little island in the bay, with no means of reaching the mainland,\r\nsuffered great hardships. For several days they had nothing but a few\r\nmussels and other shellfish which they picked up on the beach to eat.\r\nPopjoy, however, came to the rescue. He made a sort of canoe of bark\r\nand sticks, and sailed out into the open sea. Here he saw the barque\r\n_Zebra_, and made signals. He was taken on board, and a couple of boats\r\nwith provisions were sent in to feed and bring off the fugitives.\r\nFor these services Popjoy, who was a convict with a ticket-of-leave,\r\nreceived a free pardon. What became of the brig and its crew of\r\nmutineers was for some time a matter of conjecture. It was reported\r\nin Australia that she had been seen at Valparaiso. Then it was said\r\nthat she had foundered at sea owing to the ignorance of navigation\r\nof the men on board. However, in the beginning of March, 1830, the\r\nCommittee of Supercargoes at Canton were informed that four persons\r\nwith a ship's boat had landed. They represented themselves as part of\r\nthe crew of an English merchant vessel which had been wrecked on the\r\nChina coast. The story was not believed, as no such wreck had been\r\nreported, but enquiries were made and a man calling himself William\r\nWaldon, of Sunderland, was examined. He represented himself as having\r\nbeen the commander of the brig _Edward_, which left the London Docks in\r\nDecember, 1828, bound for Rio de Janeiro. On his return voyage he had\r\ncalled at Valparaiso and the Sandwich Islands. At Japan his ship had\r\nbeen fired at from a battery and much damaged. He sailed for Manilla,\r\nbut had to abandon the brig near Formosa, as she leaked heavily. He\r\nand the fifteen men of the crew had taken to the boats and all had\r\nbeen lost except himself and the three men with him. The boat bore\r\nthe name:--\"_The Edward_, of London--William Waldon.\" Although some\r\ndoubt was still entertained the Committee arranged for the four men\r\nto be taken to England in the _Charles Grant_. A few days after their\r\ndeparture another boat with three men on board arrived at Whampoa. The\r\nleader, Huntley, represented himself as having been wrecked in the\r\nbrig _Edward_, but said the captain's name was James Wilson and that\r\nshe had left London in June, 1828, and gone straight to the Cape. When\r\nnear the Ladrones he had quarrelled with Wilson and run away. As the\r\ntwo accounts differed so materially the former suspicions were revived\r\nand Huntley was sent home under arrest in the _Killie Castle_, and on\r\nthe arrival of the _Charles Grant_ in London the three men on board,\r\nJohn Anderson, Alexander Telford, and Charles Williams, were arrested.\r\nWaldon had landed at Margate, and thus escaped for the time, but was\r\narrested in London a week or two later. The four men were brought up\r\nat the Thames Police Court on September 22nd, 1830, for examination,\r\nand were charged with piracy. The principal witness was Popjoy, who\r\nhad returned to England on receiving his pardon. He identified Huntley\r\nas George James Davis, a convict who had been sentenced to death at\r\nHobart Town for highway robbery, but whose sentence had been commuted\r\nto penal servitude at Macquarie Harbour. Davis was one of the leaders\r\nof the mutiny when the brig _Cyprus_ had been seized. Alexander\r\nStevenson, sometimes called Stevie, who now appeared as Telford,\r\nhad been convicted in Glasgow in 1824, and had been reconvicted for\r\nbushranging in Australia. John Beveridge, alias Anderson, was sentenced\r\nin Perth in 1821, and was further sentenced in Hobart Town to seven\r\nyears' penal servitude for having robbed Mr. Peachey. William Watts,\r\nalias George Williams, was known in Van Diemen's Land as Wattle. He ran\r\naway from a chain gang and took to the bush. He had stabbed one man\r\nand had attempted to shoot another. Of Swallow, Popjoy knew nothing,\r\nbut had seen him on board the _Cyprus_ before the mutiny. The boat\r\nwhich had been sent from China to England was identified by Popjoy as\r\none belonging to the _Cyprus_, the names _Edward_ and _Waldon_, having\r\nbeen painted on it since the mutiny. The prisoners were tried at the\r\nAdmiralty Court, on November 4th. Popjoy, under cross-examination,\r\nadmitted that he had been transported to New South Wales for\r\nhorse-stealing. He had been assigned to a master, and had run away.\r\nHe had received two hundred lashes at Botany Bay, but this was \"only\r\na few.\" He had been sent to Van Diemen's Land, and had been charged\r\nwith highway robbery near Hobart Town, but had \"proved his innocence.\"\r\nHe had \"buried in oblivion all the charges\" made against him in the\r\ncolony. He went to Macquarie Harbour in the _Cyprus_ as a volunteer.\r\nDr. Williams, surgeon, said that he was on board the _Cyprus_ when she\r\nwas seized by convicts in Research Bay, in August, 1829. He had gone\r\nin the long boat with Lieutenant Carew to fish, and when the boat was\r\nsome distance from the brig they had heard a clashing of arms. They put\r\nback, and Lieutenant Carew tried to get on board but was repulsed, and\r\na pistol was snapped at him. He then asked for his sword, but a convict\r\nnamed Ferguson, who had it, refused to give it up. When Mrs. Carew and\r\nMrs. Williams were put into the boat, Swallow came to the side of the\r\nvessel and said, \"Gentlemen, you see I'm a pressed man. I am unarmed,\r\nand surrounded by armed men.\" In consequence of this testimony,\r\nSwallow, alias Waldon, was acquitted, but was subsequently sent to\r\nthe colony to serve his original sentence. Davis, alias Huntley,\r\nWatts, alias Williams, Stevenson, alias Telford, and Beveridge, alias\r\nAnderson, were sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nOn January 13, 1840, six bushrangers were captured at Woolnorth, near\r\nCircular Head, and were charged with having attempted to seize the\r\nschooner _Edward_, the property of the Circular Head Shipping Company\r\nof Launceston, Van Diemen's Land. The object with which this vessel was\r\nseized was to enable the bushrangers to escape to one of the South Sea\r\nIslands, where they intended to settle.\r\n\r\nThe schooner _Waterwitch_ was seized at the Forth River by three\r\nbushrangers on January 27th. The robbers told the captain that they\r\ndid not wish to do him or his vessel any harm, but that they were\r\ndetermined to go to Sealers' Cove. If he liked to take them, well and\r\ngood; if not, they would take the vessel there themselves and turn\r\nher adrift. The captain agreed. He took the bushrangers to where they\r\nwished to go, and parted with them very amicably.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time several small vessels disappeared, and it was\r\nsupposed that their captors had succeeded in navigating them to some\r\nof the Islands, but as nothing further was ever heard of them, it is\r\nsupposed that they either foundered at sea, or that if the bushrangers\r\nreached the islands, their predatory habits or brutal violence\r\nembroiled them with the natives, and they were killed in the fights\r\nwhich took place, but it is impossible to do more than conjecture their\r\nfate, and to speculate as to whether their acts of aggression were the\r\ncause of some of the apparently unprovoked attacks of the savages on\r\nthe crews or passengers of other vessels. This subject has never been\r\nadequately investigated, and there is too little evidence available to\r\nenable us at present to do more than refer to the subject as one worthy\r\nof enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe case which attracted the most notice in Australia, perhaps, was\r\nthe capture of H.M. Brig, the _Governor Phillip_. On October 15th,\r\n1842, John Jones, Thomas Whelan, George Beavors, Henry Sears, Nicholas\r\nLewis, and James Woolf, alias Mordecai, were charged in the Criminal\r\nCourt, Sydney, with that they did on the 21st June, 1842, on board\r\nthe brig _Governor Phillip_, the property of Our Sovereign Lady the\r\nQueen, assault one Charles Whitehead, with intent to murder. There was\r\na second count charging the prisoners with piracy. The brig was lying\r\nout in the roads, at Norfolk Island, discharging cargo and taking in\r\nballast. The prisoners were sent from the shore with a boat load of\r\nballast and slept on board the vessel. Two of them were called up at\r\nabout four a.m. to bale the boat out, and Jones asked William Harper,\r\none of the sailors, if he could navigate? Harper replied \"Yes, if I\r\nhad a slate and pencil.\" No notice was taken of this incident at the\r\ntime, but afterwards it was deemed to have been an indication that a\r\nconspiracy to seize the vessel had been formed among the prisoners. At\r\nseven o'clock the remainder of the boat's crew was called up to begin\r\nwork, when Bartley Kelly rushed at one of the sentries and knocked him\r\ndown with a belaying pin, while Lewis knocked down another. Then there\r\nwere cries of \"Jump overboard, you----\" and \"Throw the---- overboard\r\nand they'll tell no tales.\" Charles Whitehead was sergeant of the guard\r\nin charge at the time. Henry Sears struck him. It was not known whether\r\nthe soldiers jumped or were thrown overboard, but one sentry who was\r\nmissing had been thrown over by two of the mutineers. The noise roused\r\nthe soldiers who were below and they attempted to gain the deck, but\r\nwere driven back by the prisoners, who shouted \"Keep down, you----,\r\nor we'll kill you.\" They also called for \"Hot water to scald the----\r\nsoldiers.\" Captain Boyle, who was in command of the vessel, was in\r\nhis cabin at the time when the mutiny occurred; Christopher Lucas,\r\nthe second mate, being in charge of the deck. Lucas had been knocked\r\ndown in the first charge, but he contrived to slip away and went to\r\nthe captain's cabin and reported the mutiny. He also went to the\r\nsoldiers' quarters and roused them up, but by that time the prisoners\r\nhad control of the deck and prevented the soldiers from ascending the\r\nhatch gangway. Lucas had received several very severe blows on the head\r\nwith belaying pins and had been left for dead. The captain also tried\r\nto mount the gangway but did not succeed. He then went to the men's\r\nquarters and ordered the carpenter to cut away the fore and aft piece\r\nof the hatchway which the mutineers had closed. By this means he was\r\nenabled to raise the hatch slightly and shot a prisoner named Moore.\r\nBartley Kelly had also been severely wounded by one of the sentries and\r\nwas unable to rise. Another prisoner named McLean came to the hatchway\r\nand told Captain Boyle that if he would consent to leave the brig with\r\nthe soldiers they would all be put on shore. The captain refused.\r\nMcLean then told him to give up his arms. The captain fired at him by\r\nway of reply and McLean fell dead. The death of the leaders seemed to\r\nhave a depressing effect on the other mutineers. Beavors asked the\r\ncaptain \"for God's sake\" not to fire any more. Encouraged by this\r\nappeal for mercy, Captain Boyle forced the hatchway open and went on\r\ndeck, followed by the soldiers, and the mutineers, having lost their\r\nleaders, surrendered. The vessel was under the control of the mutineers\r\nfor about a quarter of an hour. Beavors, alias Berry, and Jones, alias\r\nJack the Lagger, were the least active of the mutineers. It was Sears\r\nwho had struck Whitehead, the sergeant of the guard, immediately after\r\nWhitehead had shot Kelly. Kelly died from his wound the following day,\r\nbut Whitehead recovered, although, at one time, his life was despaired\r\nof. The brig was 180 tons burden, and there were on board eighteen men,\r\nincluding an officer and eleven men of the 96th regiment. The Chief\r\nJustice, Sir James Dowling, before whom the case was tried, said that\r\nhad Sergeant Whitehead died he could have held out no hopes for the\r\nprisoners. The jury which had found them guilty had recommended them to\r\nmercy, and he agreed in that recommendation for all except Henry Sears.\r\nIt was his duty to pronounce the death sentence, but with the exception\r\nnamed he would not deprive them of hope. As a result Sears was hung,\r\nwhile the sentences on the other prisoners were commuted to penal\r\nservitude for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  Van Diemen's Land Again; A Hunt for Bushrangers in the Mountains;\r\n  Some Brutal Attacks; \"Stand!\" \"No, thanks, I'm very Comfortable\r\n  Sitting;\" A Degrading Exhibition; A Determined Judge; Cash, Kavanagh,\r\n  and Jones, an Enterprising Firm; The Art of Politeness as Exhibited\r\n  by Bushrangers; A Bushranger Hunt in the Streets of Hobart Town; The\r\n  Capture of Cash; Break Up of the Gang; A Doubtful Mercy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some years the roads in Van Diemen's Land had been comparatively\r\nsafe, very few highway robberies being recorded, and the newspapers\r\ngenerally asserted that bushranging, in its worst form, had been\r\nstamped out. This assertion, however, is not altogether borne out by\r\nthe evidence, and the most that can be said is that bushranging was not\r\nnearly so prevalent as in former times, and no bushranger had exercised\r\nhis calling for a sufficiently long time to earn notoriety, but even\r\nthis comparatively happy condition did not last very long.\r\n\r\nThe bushrangers James Regan, William Davis, James Atterill, alias\r\nThompson, and Anthony Bankes having committed a number of depredations\r\non the settlers, the Government resolved to make a decisive effort to\r\ncapture them. Consequently, on February 21st, 1838, Captain Mackenzie,\r\nwith three privates of the 21st Fusiliers, two constables of the Field\r\nPolice, and two prisoner volunteers, went to Jerusalem, where he was\r\ninformed by the Police Magistrate of Richmond that another house had\r\nbeen robbed by the bushrangers, who had retired to the Brown Mountain.\r\nA guide, well acquainted with the Tiers, was found, and the party\r\nstarted the following morning. They struck into the bush a short\r\ndistance beyond Mr. Tomley's, and at two o'clock came to a hut where\r\nthe stockman, an intelligent lad, informed them that the bushrangers\r\nhad robbed his master's house on the previous night at ten o'clock,\r\ntaking a horse to carry the robber Bankes, who had been wounded. The\r\nlad was taken as a guide, and led them up a ravine, which soon became\r\ntoo steep for the horses. They reached the summit of the Brown Mountain\r\nabout dusk, but without seeing any fire or other indication of a camp.\r\nThey reached Mr. Ree's house, on the Richmond side, about midnight, and\r\nreturned to Jerusalem at six on Friday morning, having been marching\r\nfor twenty-three hours over very rough country. After six hours'\r\nrest Captain Mackenzie took Wesley, one of Mr. Johnson's shepherds,\r\nas guide, and resumed the search. They reached Mr. Stokell's house\r\nat dusk, and approached it with great caution. Finding no one there,\r\nCaptain Mackenzie left two sentries, and pushed on to Romney's, where\r\nthey arrived at about half-past one. The moon was shining brightly. The\r\nhut was surrounded, and Captain Mackenzie called for three volunteers,\r\ntelling the men that it was a forlorn hope, as the robbers would\r\nprobably shoot two out of the three, the moonlight being so bright. The\r\ncaptain called on Regan by name to surrender, but received no answer.\r\nHe then walked up to the window, and said to the occupant of the hut,\r\n\"Tucker, you old blockhead! why don't you open the door?\" There was a\r\nrattle of musketry, and the captain stepped back into the shadow of\r\nthe hut. Captain Mackenzie called out to his men not to fire unless\r\nthe bushrangers did, or unless they rushed out and tried to escape.\r\nThen Constable Peacock advanced to the window and looked in. Captain\r\nMackenzie said if the door was not opened he would fire, and after\r\nwaiting a minute or so told Private Cockburn to shoot, but not too low.\r\nCockburn fired into the window when the door was opened, and a man came\r\nout. The captain cried \"Lie down, or you die.\" \"I'm Tucker,\" said the\r\nman, \"don't shoot,\" and threw himself on his face. The captain went\r\nto the door and looked in, when Private Cockburn cried, \"Take care,\r\ncaptain, the fellow is going to fire. They are all armed.\" This raised\r\na cheer among the soldiers, who now knew that their men were there.\r\nRegan it appears had tried to bring his musket to bear on the captain,\r\nbut could not do so without exposing himself. The captain gave the\r\nword to fire, and a volley was poured into the hut. Then the captain\r\nasked Regan to surrender, promising not to hurt him. Regan endeavoured\r\nto induce the captain to promise not to prosecute them, but he refused,\r\nsaying it was more than he could do. Finally, they consented to\r\nsurrender, and Atterill crawled out naked. He was tied. Regan was then\r\ncalled, and he refused to come out on his hands and knees, saying that\r\nhe would sooner be shot than be treated like a dog. The captain told\r\nhim he might walk out if he came without arms and held his hands up.\r\nHe did so, and the police then went in and brought out the other two.\r\nThe prisoners were handcuffed and placed in a cart. About £14, found\r\nin their clothes, and their guns and pistols, were carried in another\r\ncart. Tucker was employed by Mr. Romney and was considered the best\r\nguide in the district. The robbers had taken possession of his hut and\r\nintended to make him show them the way across the mountains on the\r\nfollowing day. The party reached Richmond on Saturday night, and early\r\nnext day the bushrangers were lodged in the gaol at Hobart Town. The\r\nprisoners were tried and convicted of several acts of bushranging,\r\nranging from highway robbery to burglary. They were all sentenced to\r\ndeath, but only Regan was hung.[34] _The Cornwall Chronicle_ said \"His\r\ninquisitors were conscious that, had he been permitted to give his\r\ndying attestation to the treatment he had received from his master, it\r\nwould have been so appalling and horrible as to leave the guilt of his\r\ncrimes, in the estimation of an impartial public, not on his own head,\r\nbut on theirs.\" \"The Government,\" said the paper, \"is afraid to hear\r\nthe dying statements of the condemned.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 8th, 1840, two armed men entered the Post Office at Ross,\r\nand bailed up the post-mistress, who was also a store-keeper. They took\r\nfrom her about £16 in cash and a quantity of wearing apparel. A large\r\nsum of money which was enclosed in a letter ready for despatch was\r\nmissed by the robbers. The police were informed and at once followed\r\non the track of the bushrangers, but failed to arrest them. On the\r\nfollowing evening the bushrangers went to a hut on the station of Mr.\r\nJoseph Penny, of Ashby Cottage, and tied the shepherd, telling him that\r\nif he was quiet and did as he was ordered they would not hurt him;\r\nbut that if he refused to obey they would shoot him. They went to the\r\ngardener's lodge and compelled the gardener to give them some food.\r\nWhile they were engaged in eating a man who had previously agreed to go\r\nout opossum hunting with the shepherd called at the hut and shouted. He\r\nreceived no answer, the shepherd believing that the bushrangers were\r\n\"trying\" him. The friend knocked again and shouted, but receiving no\r\nreply went in. He was surprised to see the shepherd lying down tied and\r\nquickly untied him. The two men then went to the house and informed\r\nMr. Penny of what was going on. Quickly arming himself and the two men\r\nMr. Penny went to the gardener's lodge and surprised the bushrangers\r\nbefore they could get their pistols and guns ready. They were tied and\r\nconducted into the town, and were subsequently convicted and sent to\r\npenal servitude.\r\n\r\nJames Leverett, while driving a cart belonging to Mr. James Cox,\r\nof Clarendon, was attacked by a bushranger and brutally beaten.\r\nThe bushranger struck him on the head from behind and stunned him.\r\nHe stopped the horse and battered Leverett about the head. Then he\r\nsearched his pockets and decamped. The constable stationed at Morven\r\nhappened to pass along the road, and seeing the horse and cart standing\r\nwent over to ascertain what was the matter. Finding Leverett lying\r\nin the cart insensible the constable took him to the police station\r\nand sent for a doctor. He then followed the tracks of the bushranger,\r\nbut failed to find him. Another man, a servant of Mr. Stephenson, of\r\nCurramore, was beaten and robbed in a similar manner. It was said that\r\nthese assaults were committed by ticket-of-leave men, who were thrown\r\nout of employment by the arrival of a large number of free immigrants.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th April, 1841, James Broomfield and Jonas Hopkins bailed up\r\nand robbed Henry Atkins, Bonney, taking seven five pound notes from\r\nhim. In company with James McCallum the same two bushrangers went to\r\nthe house of Thomas Bates, at Norfolk Plains, about midnight, and woke\r\nhim up, demanding something to drink. Bates told them that there was\r\nplenty of water in the cask. This, however, did not satisfy them, and\r\nthey broke into the kitchen. They took some flour and grain from the\r\ncask and made a damper. While this was baking they took a watch, some\r\nmoney, and a quantity of clothes out of the bedroom. When they had had\r\na meal, they left with their plunder, but were followed and captured.\r\nThey were convicted of robbery with firearms and were sentenced to\r\ndeath; their sentences were, however, commuted to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\nJohn Gunn, George Griffiths, William Lambeth, Samuel Harrison, and\r\nThomas Hurn stuck up and robbed Daniel Downie on the 5th September,\r\n1842, of clothing and money. They were followed by Constables Patrick\r\nFlynn and George Marsden, and a volunteer named Joseph Masson. The\r\nbushrangers were armed with a fowling-piece and a musket. They went\r\nnext morning to the hut of James Thompson, and told him not to be\r\nfrightened as they did not intend to hurt him. They took his money\r\nand were walking away, when the constables came up and called on them\r\nto stand. They surrendered and were taken to gaol. When they were\r\nconvicted, sentence of death was recorded against each of them, but\r\nthey were not hung.\r\n\r\nOn May 4th, 1843, Mr. Thomas Massey, of Ellerslie, South Esk River,\r\nwas sitting on his verandah when John Conway came up, presented a gun\r\nat his head, and cried \"Stand.\" \"No, thank you,\" replied Mr. Massey,\r\n\"I'm very comfortable sitting down. What do you want?\" Conway then\r\nasked where the man was. Mr. Massey replied, \"Out in the kitchen.\" A\r\nman named Riley Jeffs was standing a short distance away with Henry\r\nBlunt and a man named Pockett, both of whom had their hands tied behind\r\nthem. Jeffs left the two tied men and went round to the kitchen, while\r\nConway demanded money and firearms. Jeffs returned with the manservant\r\nand tied his hands. The robbers then took two double-barrelled guns, a\r\nsingle-barrelled fowling-piece, with a shot belt and powder flask, some\r\ntea, sugar, flour, and a gallon of rum. After they had gone Constable\r\nThomas Connell, of Campbelltown, with Joseph Masson, Matthew Perry,\r\nEdward Quin, Aaron Dunn, and Stephen Wright followed the bushrangers\r\nto Blunt's hut, when two men ran away. One of them was lame and was\r\nsoon caught. It was Jeffs, who said he had accidentally wounded himself\r\nthe day before, after he left Mr. Massey's. The other man, Conway, was\r\ncaptured after a brisk run. At their trial, Mary Bryan, servant at Mr.\r\nMassey's, said she recognised Conway by his big nose. \"How many inches?\r\nDid you measure it?\" asked Jeffs, but the question was ruled out of\r\norder by Judge Montagu. The prisoners were then tried for the murder\r\nof Constable William Ward. They went to Mr. James Gilligan's house,\r\nClifton Lodge, Break-o'-day Road, and asked Sarah Vasco, the servant,\r\nwhether any one was at home. She replied, \"Only master and mistress\r\nand a gentleman.\" They had four men with their hands tied behind them.\r\nJeffs stopped with these at the kitchen door, while Conway walked into\r\nthe passage. When he reached the parlour door he presented his gun\r\nand cried, \"Stand, or I'll blow the contents of this through you.\"\r\nWard, who was sitting near the door, jumped up and grappled with the\r\nbushranger. They struggled together into the passage. Mrs. Gilligan\r\npushed her husband to prevent him from going out, and slammed the\r\nparlour door. Mr. Gilligan heard the struggle along the passage, and\r\nthen a gun went off. He got the door open at last and went out. He saw\r\nWard lying on the floor of the kitchen. Jeffs and Conway and the four\r\nmen whose hands were tied were looking at him. Conway said to Gilligan,\r\n\"You go back into your room, old man, or I'll mark you.\" In the fight\r\nin the passage both of the men had endeavoured to obtain possession\r\nof the gun, but between them they let it fall and it exploded without\r\ninjuring any one. Conway then broke away and ran into the kitchen.\r\nWard followed him and was grappled by Jeffs. While they were wrestling\r\nConway drew a pistol and watched for a chance, and when Ward was on top\r\nholding Jeffs down Conway deliberately put the pistol to his shoulder\r\nand fired. Ward rolled over dead, and Jeffs got up. The robbers then\r\ndemanded money, and Mrs. Gilligan went to the bedroom upstairs to fetch\r\nsome. Conway accompanied her. Mrs. Gilligan said, \"It's a great pity,\r\nMr. Ward had a large family.\" \"Well,\" replied Conway, \"why didn't he\r\nkeep out of our road? We tried to shoot him before.\" The prisoners were\r\nconvicted of wilful murder. In his summing up the Judge said that the\r\nfour men who were present appeared to be accomplices, although they\r\nwere tied. They had prevaricated so much in their evidence that it\r\nwas worthless or worse. He would consider whether it was advisable to\r\nprosecute them for perjury. Conway was very violent while in gaol. He\r\nthrew a loaf of bread at the gaoler, and threatened that if he got out\r\nhe'd \"do for him.\" Jeffs and Conway were hung at Launceston in July.\r\nThe census of the town had been taken a short time before, and showed\r\nthat the population was 4458 souls. _The Launceston Advertiser_ said\r\nthat there were more than a thousand men, women, and boys present to\r\nsee Jeffs and Conway hung. Numbers of people took their blankets with\r\nthem and slept in the square all night. They were singing songs and\r\nmaking a great noise. The paper says the scene was a disgraceful one,\r\nand doubts whether such exhibitions can have any beneficial effect.\r\n\r\nJohn Price and Thomas Roberts were tried for highway robbery. Judge\r\nMontagu said that if the robbery had been committed at night, or if any\r\nundue violence had been used, he would have cast them for death without\r\nhope of mercy. It appeared, however, that they had been followed and\r\ncaptured at once, and therefore, although the death sentence would be\r\nrecorded against them, they would be sent to a penal settlement, and he\r\nhoped they would reform.\r\n\r\nJohn Fletcher and Henry Lee stuck up and robbed Daniel Griffin at\r\nCocked Hat Hill, on November 6th, 1844. In passing sentence of death,\r\nJudge Montagu said that he was determined to put down robbery on the\r\nhigh road between Hobart Town and Launceston, and especially about\r\nCocked Hat Hill. It was a horrid place. No man was safe there. The\r\nresidents were fortunate in having so active and energetic an officer\r\nstationed there as Constable Harvey. He would sentence the prisoners to\r\ntransportation for life. When they were being removed from court, Lee\r\nsaid, as he was passing Constable Harvey: \"I'll rip your---- guts out,\r\nyou----, if ever I get out.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th July, 1841, Hogan and Armytage visited the Travellers'\r\nRest Inn, within four miles of Launceston. There were eight men in\r\nthe bar and they took all the money they could get, some grog, and\r\nprovisions. Hogan said he was tired of the bush, and wished \"it was\r\nall over.\" Armytage looked ill and miserable. The police followed them\r\nas soon as news of the robbery was conveyed to Launceston, but without\r\nsuccess, as the bushrangers were too well acquainted with the country\r\nround there.\r\n\r\nOn January 8, 1841, a bushranger went to a shepherd's hut on Mr.\r\nFrank's station, Lake Crescent, and tied the shepherd, telling him\r\nthat he would shoot him if he got loose. The robber only got a few\r\nshillings. The robber went away, but soon returned, and seeing the\r\nshepherd still tied, cautioned him again and went away. The man\r\nremained tied for several hours before he attempted to untie the rope.\r\nIt was said that this was the man who had robbed Mr. McCrae's station,\r\nand murdered a shepherd on Mr. Brodribb's station.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Hogan the bushranger walked into a public-house\r\nkept by Mrs. Bonny at Deloraine, and asked for two case bottles of rum.\r\nOn these being given to him, he took a ham and a pudding and walked\r\naway, saying that he wanted them for his mate, who was ill. Although\r\nthere were five or six men in the bar at the time, no attempt was made\r\nto detain him. Nothing further is known about Armytage, who is supposed\r\nto have died in the bush; but Hogan was captured and sentenced to penal\r\nservitude on Norfolk Island.\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 1842, it was reported that Martin Cash, the notorious\r\nbushranger who had for so long a time defied the police, had been\r\ncaptured in a house in Harrington Street, Hobart Town, by Constables\r\nKirby and Williams. He was lodged in the lock-up, but during the night\r\nsucceeded in making his escape.\r\n\r\nOn March 25, 1843, the bushrangers Martin Cash, Lawrence Kavanagh, and\r\nThomas Jones, armed to the teeth, bailed up Mr. Panton at Broad Marsh,\r\nand fired at Dr. Macdonald. The police started in pursuit. On April\r\n18th, the gang visited Mr. Hay, who was in his barn overlooking five\r\nshearers who were at work. They were ordered to stand up and put down\r\ntheir shears. Then the men were forced to tie each other. While the\r\nbushrangers were plundering the house, Mr. Ward came up. He was ordered\r\nto stand, but instead of obeying he ran away. Cash followed and fired\r\nhis pistol, the shot grazing Ward's ear. Ward, however, kept on and got\r\nbehind a tree, and the bushrangers decamped, taking very little plunder\r\nwith them. On the 19th they captured Mr. John Clarke and his overseer,\r\nMr. Denholme, and compelled them to accompany the bushrangers to the\r\nlate Mr. Allardyce's house on the Clyde River. They went into the\r\nparlour, and after arranging the chairs, invited the gentlemen to sit\r\ndown. Then they called for brandy and glasses. The servant brought in a\r\nbottle of brandy and a tin pannikin. Cash was in a great rage. He swore\r\nat the servant, and asked him in an indignant tone, \"Is that a proper\r\nthing for gentlemen to drink out of? Take it away and bring glasses.\"\r\nWhen they had had some refreshments, Cash sat talking to Messrs. Clarke\r\nand Denholme, while Kavanagh and Jones collected the plunder. The\r\nbushrangers were said to be very haggard in appearance and not well\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nOn May the 18th they invited themselves to visit Captain McKay, on\r\nthe Dee River, and dined with him in the most amicable manner. After\r\ndinner they loaded two horses with clothing, provisions, and other\r\narticles from the store. Then, taking Captain McKay with them, they\r\nwent to Mr. Gellibrand's, where they loaded a third horse. With this\r\nthe bushrangers appear to have been satisfied, as they went away.\r\n\r\n\"Messrs. Cash & Co.,\" as some of the Van Diemen's Land papers called\r\nthe gang, visited Mr. Christopher Gatenby, of the Isis, on July 1st,\r\nand politely apologised for their intrusion. They as politely asked for\r\na supply of provisions, which they said were necessary owing to the\r\npolice having recently captured their camp and taken away all that they\r\ncould find there. Mr. Gatenby opened the store and gave them what they\r\nrequired, and then Cash said he should feel extremely obliged if Mr.\r\nGatenby and four of his servants would carry the provisions to their\r\nnew camp. He politely explained that this was necessary, as the police\r\nhad taken their horses. The invitation was so pressing that Mr. Gatenby\r\ncould not refuse. He therefore took up a portion of the swag, while\r\nhis servants shouldered the rest, and escorted by the three bushrangers\r\nthey started into the bush. After walking for about two miles Cash said\r\nhe would not trouble Mr. Gatenby to go any further, as he thought that\r\nthey could manage without him. The load he was carrying was distributed\r\namong the bushrangers, and Mr. Gatenby returned home, after having been\r\nprofusely thanked for his generosity in giving them the provisions and\r\nhis kindness in carrying them so far. The servants were taken two or\r\nthree miles further into the bush, and were then allowed to deposit\r\ntheir loads under a gum tree and return home. Cash denied that the gang\r\nhad had an encounter with the Campbelltown constables. He said that the\r\nconstables found their hiding place when he and his mates were absent.\r\n\r\nOn August 22nd two men dressed as sailors were seen by the constables\r\nin Hobart Town enquiring for the residence of a well-known suspicious\r\ncharacter. One of the constables stepped forward, and gave them the\r\naddress they required. Then one of the sailors walked away, while the\r\nother remained standing near the constables as if in bravado. The\r\nconstables held a consultation, and decided to arrest the sailor as a\r\nsuspicious character. Two of them went towards him, when the sailor\r\ndrew a pistol, fired, and then ran. The shot took no effect, and the\r\nconstables gave chase. Charles Cunliffe, a carpenter, was standing at\r\nthe door of his house as the sailor passed, and hearing the constables\r\nchasing him and crying \"Stop, thief!\" he joined in the chase. As\r\nthey went down Brisbane Street Constable Winstanley came out of the\r\nCommodore Inn on hearing the hullabaloo, and attempted to seize the\r\nsailor, but the sailor drew a pistol from his belt and fired. The\r\nball passed through Constable Winstanley's chest, but nevertheless he\r\ngrappled with the sailor and held him until Cunliffe came up, when\r\nWinstanley fell. Cunliffe and the sailor had a terrific struggle for\r\na few minutes, Cunliffe being much bruised, but he held on until the\r\nother constables arrived and secured their man. The sailor was taken\r\nto the Penitentiary, where he was identified as Martin Cash. It was\r\nbelieved that the other sailor was Lawrence Kavanagh, but although\r\nsearch was made for him, he could not be found. Constable Winstanley\r\ndied from the effects of his wound two days later.\r\n\r\nMartin Cash was tried for the murder of Peter Winstanley on September\r\n15th, and was found guilty. He said he had been standing quietly in\r\nthe street when a constable came up and cried out, \"It's Cash, blow\r\nhis brains out.\" He had then fired and run. The constables were all\r\ncowards. They thronged round him when he was down, but they would\r\nnever have caught him if it had not been for Cunliffe. Judge Montagu\r\nsaid in reply that he could see no proof of cowardice in the action of\r\nthe police. They were not such fast runners as the prisoner. Charles\r\nCunliffe was the more active, and consequently he had caught the\r\nprisoner first. For this he deserved credit, but the police had arrived\r\nat the spot without delay and were also to be complimented for their\r\nshare in the capture of so dangerous a character as the prisoner. He\r\nthen sentenced the prisoner to be hung on Monday, the 18th instant.\r\n\r\nCash, however, was not hung, but was sent to Norfolk Island for life.\r\nRewards of one hundred acres of land or one hundred sovereigns, in\r\naddition to the rewards previously offered of fifty sovereigns, with\r\na free pardon for convicts and a free passage to any post in Her\r\nMajesty's dominions, were offered for the capture of Kavanagh and\r\nJones, dead or alive.\r\n\r\nThomas Jones, in company with John Liddell and James Dalton, stuck up\r\nCatherine Smith's house on December 6th, at Effingham Banks. They tied\r\nthe servants and went into Mrs. Smith's bedroom. The lady requested\r\nthem to go out while she dressed, and they complied. When Mrs. Smith\r\ngot up the bushrangers ordered the servants to get them some supper,\r\ntelling them that they need not be afraid, as nobody would hurt them.\r\nThey made the servants sit down while they ate. After their meal they\r\nopened the drawers and took out clothes and other articles which suited\r\nthem, and went away. On December 11th they stuck up a hawker named John\r\nMcCall. They drove his cart half a mile into the bush off the road, and\r\ntied McCall to a tree. Then they made a bundle of the articles they\r\nwanted in the cart, and went away. On December 30th Thomas Jones,\r\n\"late with Messrs. Cash & Co.,\" with another man named Moore, dressed\r\nas sporting gentlemen, went to Mr. William Field's, and enquired if\r\nhe was in? They were answered in the negative, and they then went to\r\nthe men's hut and bailed up the two men there. As the others came\r\nin they were compelled to stand in a row against the wall. When Mr.\r\nShanklin, the overseer, came in, Moore told him to kneel down and say\r\nhis prayers, as he intended to shoot him. The men interceded for the\r\noverseer, saying that he always had treated them well. Moore asserted\r\nthat Shanklin had \"got him an extension of time,\" and he meant to have\r\nrevenge. He was very violent in his language. Jones had been looking on\r\nvery quietly, but he now said, \"Oh, let the---- go, and let him beware\r\nhow he behaves in future.\" Moore at first objected, but gave way, and\r\nShanklin was made to stand up with the assigned servants. The robbers\r\nbroke open Mr. Field's escritoire, and took £50 out of it. They also\r\ntook tea, sugar, flour, and other things from the store.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the police had not been idle. They had had several\r\nbrushes with the bushrangers, and had captured Kavanagh, Liddell,\r\nand Dalton. After this last robbery Jones and Moore were followed,\r\nand Jones was captured. They were all convicted and sentenced to\r\ndeath, but were told that probably their sentences would be commuted\r\nto penal servitude. On hearing this Liddell exclaimed, \"I don't want\r\nmercy from you or any one else. I've been eleven years at Port Arthur\r\nand I don't want to go there again. I'd rather die than live.\" Judge\r\nMontagu said that this statement showed a deplorable frame of mind and\r\nexhorted Liddell to think of the future. Dalton complained that he had\r\nbeen knocked down by Thompson, the gaoler. Mr. Thompson said that the\r\nprisoner was a very desperate man. \"But you'd no right to put irons on\r\nmy neck,\" cried Dalton. The Judge said it was the duty of the gaoler\r\nto prevent escape. If he deemed it necessary he had a perfect right to\r\nput irons on the neck of a prisoner as well as on his hands and feet.\r\nHe should report the behaviour of the prisoners in the proper quarter\r\nand he could not recommend either Liddell or Dalton to mercy. \"I don't\r\ncare a---- what you do,\" exclaimed Dalton. George Cumsden, who had also\r\nbeen associated with Jones in some of his robberies since the capture\r\nof Cash and Kavanagh, was also sentenced to death, \"without the hope\r\nof mercy.\" He had threatened to \"blow a hole through\" any witness who\r\nappeared against him.\r\n\r\nThere was again a lull in bushranging in Van Diemen's Land, and again\r\nthe papers asserted that the crime had been stamped out. The majority\r\nof those convicted had been sent to Norfolk Island, and this, it was\r\nsaid, would act as a deterrent to other evil doers. Norfolk Island was\r\nfeared more than death.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _The Colonial Times._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  Norfolk Island: Its Founding as a Penal Station; The Terrible\r\n  Discipline in Norfolk Island; An Attempt to Ameliorate it; Its\r\n  Failure; The Rigorous Treatment Restored; The Consequent Riot; Jackey\r\n  Jackey's Revenge; An Unparalleled Tale of Ferocity; The Soldiers\r\n  Overawe the Rioters; Thirteen Condemned to the Gallows; Jackey\r\n  Jackey's Remarkable Letter; The End of Several Notorious Bushrangers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorfolk Island, lying some seven hundred miles from the coast of New\r\nSouth Wales, was first utilised as a penal settlement in 1788, when\r\nit was decided that convicts who committed crimes in New South Wales\r\nshould be transported there for more severe treatment. Early in the\r\nnineteenth century a rumour spread in Australia that Napoleon the First\r\nintended to fit out a fleet to search for Admiral La Perouse, and to\r\nfound colonies in the south seas. The truth of this rumour seemed to\r\nbe affirmed by the activity of the naval authorities in New South\r\nWales. Settlements were made at Port Essington in the north, King\r\nGeorge's Sound in the west, and the Derwent River in Van Diemen's Land.\r\nShortly afterwards, in 1805, the prisoners were removed from Norfolk\r\nIsland to Hobart Town, apparently for the purpose of strengthening\r\nthe settlement in Van Diemen's Land. When Van Diemen's Land was made\r\nindependent of New South Wales, in 1825, Norfolk Island was again made\r\na penal settlement of the mother colony, and it so continued until\r\ntransportation to New South Wales ceased in 1842, when Norfolk Island\r\nwas transferred from the jurisdiction of the Governor of New South\r\nWales to that of the Governor of Van Diemen's Land. The treatment of\r\nthe prisoners in the island was rigorous in the extreme, and may aptly\r\nbe described as savage. When the enquiry of the House of Commons, by\r\nSelect Committee, was made in 1837 and 1838, as to the condition of\r\nthe convicts in the penal settlements, the few particulars published\r\nabout the evidence in the English newspapers had some effect on public\r\nopinion, and in 1841, Captain Maconochie, one of the witnesses examined\r\nwho said that the prisoners might be governed with less harshness, was\r\nappointed Commandant of Norfolk Island, with instructions to try the\r\nmild reformatory treatment he advocated. Captain Maconochie and his\r\nsupporters in England do not seem to have realised that human beings\r\nwho have been under demoralising influences until they have reached\r\nthe adult age, and their characters have become set, are not amenable\r\nto civilising influences. These should have been applied during the\r\nimpressionable years, and the younger they are applied the more\r\nsuccessful they are likely to be. This fact, however, does not yet seem\r\nto be known sufficiently in England, and therefore small blame attaches\r\nto Captain Maconochie, if he was not aware of it sixty years ago. The\r\nnew Commandant abolished Sunday labour as a punishment, shortened the\r\nhours of labour on week-days, and granted holidays for good behaviour.\r\nHe allowed the men to build huts and to cultivate small patches of\r\nground, and thus to provide themselves with vegetables. He also gave\r\nthem tins to cook in, and served out rations individually, instead of\r\ngiving the rations out in messes. It does not appear that the prisoners\r\nbecame unduly riotous under this treatment, and no such murders as\r\nwere mentioned by Judge Forbes and other witnesses before the Select\r\nCommittee, in which men had killed their mates for the purpose of being\r\nhung \"out of their misery,\" took place. One of these murders which\r\noccurred only a short time before Captain Maconochie took charge may be\r\nmentioned here. Stephen Brennan was sent to the island for bushranging.\r\nHe was tried there and found guilty of the murder of another convict.\r\nThere had been no quarrel between the two men, who were as friendly\r\nas circumstances permitted under the rigid discipline, nevertheless\r\nBrennan suddenly struck Patrick Lynch a blow with a stone-breaker's\r\nhammer, and then stabbed him with a knife. The murder was committed\r\navowedly so that the perpetrator might be hung, and thus escape the\r\nharsh treatment he was subjected to, and it is not improbable that\r\nit was committed with the consent of the victim, for although there\r\nis no evidence of this in this case, it is well known that men had\r\nactually drawn lots in Norfolk Island, to decide which should murder\r\nthe other and get hung for the crime. In place of crimes like this,\r\nthere were quarrels and some rowdyism, but this was sufficient for\r\nthe opponents of the new experiment. Paragraphs appeared in the Van\r\nDiemen's Land papers jeering at the \"plum pudding policy\" of Captain\r\nMaconochie, and asserting that Queen's birthday rejoicings only led\r\nto increased disturbances in Norfolk Island. Whether these paragraphs\r\nwere inspired by the prison officials, who feared that if Captain\r\nMaconochie was successful there would be an end of \"the system\" which\r\nthey had organised, it is impossible to say, but after a three years'\r\ntrial, the mild treatment was pronounced a failure, and Major Joseph\r\nChilds was appointed to supersede Captain Maconochie, as Commandant of\r\nNorfolk Island, and reached the island on February 8th, 1844. Major\r\nChilds landed with orders to revert to the old rigid discipline, and\r\nhe appears to have endeavoured to carry these orders out to the best\r\nof his ability. The hours of work were increased, holidays abolished,\r\nand all the old punishments re-established. These alterations were\r\nmade very gradually. As I have already said, the prisoners had been\r\nsupplied with rations individually, and were allowed their own pots\r\nand pans to cook them with. In July, 1846, new regulations were issued\r\nthat rations were to be issued in bulk and to be cooked in the general\r\nmess house. The rations on the island had always been notoriously bad,\r\nand consisted generally of salt beef and maize. Captain Maconochie had\r\nallowed them to grow potatoes. The privilege was abolished on January\r\n1st, 1846, when the garden plots were taken from the prisoners and\r\nlaid waste. The prisoners refused in a body to go to work unless some\r\nequivalent was given them for their potatoes, and half a pint of peas\r\ndaily was promised them. After three days the peas in stock gave out,\r\nand another mutiny took place. Numbers of the prisoners were flogged,\r\nbut this did not quieten them, and Commandant Childs promised them\r\nthat eight ounces of flour should be served out in place of the peas.\r\nIn a few days, however, the stock of flour was exhausted, and then,\r\n\"incredible as it may appear, an old order, issued in May, 1846, after\r\nthe gardens were taken away from the prisoners, stating that two\r\npounds of sweet potatoes should form part of the daily rations, was\r\nposted up; although it must have been known to the superintendent that\r\nit would be utterly impossible to serve out a single ounce of sweet\r\npotatoes a man daily for a week.\"[35] The sweet potatoes in the island\r\nhad been grown by the men, and had been most unjustly taken away from\r\nthem when their gardens were laid waste. It was well-known that there\r\nwere no sweet potatoes in the island, and the reposting of this old\r\nand obsolete regulation was an outrage on truth. The prisoners were\r\nnot slow in showing their indignation, nor very particular as to the\r\nwords they used in expressing it. And it was during the dissatisfaction\r\nconsequent on the posting of this old order, that the new regulation\r\ncalling in the kettles on July the 1st was posted. When the order\r\nwas first posted, the majority of the prisoners were in their cells.\r\nA few were attending school, and among these was Jackey Jackey, who\r\nwas doing a sum when the soldiers came round to collect the kettles.\r\nHearing the rattling of the tins, he raised himself up, pencil in\r\nhand, and listened intently. Then he pushed the slate away, folded his\r\narms, and sat as if in deep thought. The other prisoners present were\r\nwhispering together, trying to conjecture what was being done with\r\ntheir tins. On the following morning, July 2nd, the prisoners were all\r\nmustered for prayers, a practice only recently introduced along with\r\nthe repressive measures of the new superintendent. During the service\r\nthe men kept whispering and paid but little attention. Several times\r\norder was called for, but this only produced a lull for a time. When\r\nthe prayers were over the men marched to the Lumber Yard and read\r\nthe new regulation. Then they found that their tins had already been\r\nremoved. There was silence for a moment, followed by fierce and eager\r\nwhisperings, then the whole body marched to the Barrack Yard, broke\r\nopen the store, and took out all the tins they could find. They marched\r\nback to the Lumber Yard, and then Jackey Jackey made the following\r\nspeech:--\"Now, men, I've made up my mind to bear this oppression no\r\nlonger; but, remember, I'm going to the gallows. If any man funks let\r\nhim stand out. Those who wish to follow me, come on.\"\r\n\r\nA policeman named Morris was standing in the archway or entrance to\r\nthe yard, Jackey Jackey rushed forward, struck him a fearful blow\r\nwith an enormous bludgeon, and knocked him down. A large mob of the\r\nprisoners snatched up such weapons as came to their hands and followed\r\nhim. Many of the prisoners only had sticks, some large, some small.\r\nOne had a reaping hook and another a pitchfork. As soon as the sentry\r\nfell under the blow from Jackey Jackey, the other prisoners were\r\nupon him, beating, stabbing, and cutting until the man was a fearful\r\nsight to look upon. Jackey Jackey then led the way to the cook-house,\r\nwhere Stephen Smith, the police overseer, was in charge. Smith was\r\nsomething of a favourite among the prisoners, but this good feeling\r\navailed him nothing at this time. When Jackey Jackey came rushing\r\ntowards him, Smith cried out in a piteous tone, \"For God's sake don't\r\nhurt me, Jackey? Remember my wife and children!\" \"Damn your wife and\r\nchildren,\" shrieked Jackey Jackey, as he crashed in one side of Smith's\r\nhead with his bludgeon. Jackey Jackey passed on, leaving those who\r\nfollowed him to finish his bloody work if necessary. Near the gate of\r\nthe Barrack-yard John Price, overseer of work, and a man named Ingram\r\nwere standing together. Jackey Jackey rushed towards them and aimed a\r\nblow at Price, but he dodged back and the club struck Ingram, nearly\r\nkilling him. Jackey Jackey raised his club for another blow at Price,\r\nwhen the surging crowd behind pushed him forward, and Price escaped and\r\nran for the soldiers. The prisoners behind Jackey Jackey now raised\r\nthe cry of \"Barrow! Barrow!\" and from this it is conjectured that\r\ntheir main object was the murder of the Stipendiary Magistrate of the\r\nIsland, Mr. Barrow, who was believed by the prisoners to be the cause\r\nof much of their misery. Jackey Jackey turned from the Barrack-yard\r\nand led the way towards Government House. On their road they came to\r\nthe limekilns, and Jackey Jackey, who had by this time exchanged his\r\nclub for an axe, opened the door of the hut there. Two policemen were\r\nstationed there and they had not yet risen from their beds. One named\r\nDixon was still asleep, and Jackey Jackey smashed the axe through\r\nhis skull as he lay. The other, Simon, sprang from his bed on to the\r\nfloor, but was immediately knocked down by a ferocious blow aimed at\r\nhim by the bushranger, his brains and blood spattering the walls of the\r\nhut. Jackey Jackey immediately left the hut, and while his followers\r\ncrowded in to strike at, or jeer at, their dead enemies as their humour\r\nprompted them, he coolly stood aside and lighted his pipe. After\r\ndrawing a few whiffs he said in a loud calm voice, \"Now, boys, for the\r\nChrist killer,\" and the crowd responded with shouts of \"Hooray! Now\r\nfor Barrow's.\" \"To Barrow's.\" \"To Barrow's.\" They started off, but had\r\nnot gone far when the soldiers with muskets loaded and bayonets fixed\r\nbarred the road.\r\n\r\nAt this time there were about eighteen hundred prisoners on the island,\r\nand of these, sixteen hundred were among the rioters. The soldiers\r\nnumbered only about three hundred, but their discipline enabled them\r\nto overawe the vastly superior force, numerically, opposed to them.\r\nPerhaps the habits of obedience and submission, so long enforced on\r\nthe prisoners, may have had some influence. Perhaps, even among this\r\nherd of desperate and reckless men, the sight of the soldiers standing\r\nfirmly with their guns presented ready to fire may have instilled\r\nsome fear. However this may have been, there was no fight. The rebels\r\nretired slowly and unwillingly to the Lumber Yard, where they permitted\r\nthe soldiers to arrest them one after the other without making any show\r\nof defence until one thousand one hundred and ten of them were placed\r\n\"on the chain.\" Perhaps Jackey Jackey and the more violent of his\r\nfollowers may have thought that they had done sufficient to ensure them\r\nthat death on the gallows which was the avowed object of their rising,\r\nwhile the majority had been so demoralised by official brutality as to\r\nbe utterly indifferent as to what might become of them.\r\n\r\nAmong those arrested were Jackey Jackey, the bushranger with a\r\ncontinental notoriety, and Lawrence Kavanagh, the Van Diemen's Land\r\nhighwayman. John Gardner, John Jackson, William Duncan, Abraham\r\nFarrer, and John Booth, some of them convicted bushrangers, were\r\nalso conspicuous for their support of Jackey Jackey in the murder of\r\nofficials. Another New South Wales bushranger engaged in this riot was\r\nMichael Houlihan, who had been captured by Commissioner Brigham on\r\nSeptember 10, 1842, in the Lachlan district, and transported to Van\r\nDiemen's Land for highway robbery and horse-stealing, and had been\r\nsent from thence to Norfolk Island for similar offences committed near\r\nHobart Town. Besides these there were John Price, and many others named\r\nin Chapter X., who were among the insurgents and who more or less\r\nactively supported the leaders. On the other hand, Martin Cash, the\r\ncompanion of Kavanagh, refused to take part in the rising. He retired\r\nfrom the Lumber Yard when Jackey Jackey announced his intention,\r\nand remained in his cell during the whole time of the riot. Some\r\nspeculation has been indulged in as to his reason for so acting. It is\r\ncertain that he was not deterred by fear. Possibly, having been for so\r\nlong the leader of a gang of bushrangers, he objected to serve under\r\nanother and a younger man. He, however, was almost the only well-known\r\nbushranger confined in the island at the time who did not follow Jackey\r\nJackey.\r\n\r\nAs soon as news of the riot and its suppression reached Van\r\nDiemen's Land, Judge Brown was sent to Norfolk Island by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, Sir W.T. Denison, to try the prisoners, and Jackey\r\nJackey, Henry Whiting, William Pickthorne, William Scrimshaw, Kavanagh,\r\nGardner, Jackson, Duncan, Farrer, Booth, and three others, making\r\nthirteen in all, were arraigned on the charge of murdering John Morris.\r\nThey were convicted and sentenced to death. They were all executed on\r\nOctober 13, 1846.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written by Jackey Jackey to a former chaplain\r\nat Port Arthur, and was published in the _Cornwall Chronicle_. \"The\r\nspelling of many of the words has been corrected, but the style has not\r\nbeen interfered with\":--\r\n\r\n H.M. Gaol, Norfolk Island.\r\n Condemned Cells, 1846, October the 8th.\r\n\r\n  Reverend Sir,--As in duty bound to you for the kindness you have\r\n  shown to me, and the interest I have always seen you take in those\r\n  that have ever been under your spiritual care, whatever may be\r\n  their fate, I have been induced to write to you, hoping this may\r\n  find you in good health, and in the enjoyment of all God's choicest\r\n  blessings. I have to inform you, that long before this letter reaches\r\n  your hands, the hand that wrote this will be cold in death. I do not\r\n  grieve that the hour is fast approaching that is to end my earthly\r\n  career. I welcome death as a friend;--the world, or what I have seen\r\n  of it, has no allurements in it for me. 'Tis not for me to boast;\r\n  but yet, Sir, allow a dying man to speak a few words to one who\r\n  has always shown a sympathy for the wretched outcasts of society,\r\n  and ever, with a Christian charity, strove to recall the wretched\r\n  wanderer to a sense of his lost condition. I started in life with a\r\n  good feeling for my fellowman. Before I well knew the responsibility\r\n  of my station in life, I had forfeited my birth-right. I became a\r\n  slave, and was sent far from my dear native country, my parents, my\r\n  brother, and sisters--torn from all that was dear to me, and that\r\n  for a trifling offence. Since then I have been treated more like\r\n  a beast than a man, until nature could bear no more. I was, like\r\n  many others, driven to despair by the oppressive and tyrannical\r\n  conduct of whose whose duty it was to prevent us from being treated\r\n  in this way. Yet these men are courted by society; and the British\r\n  Government, deceived by the interested representations of these\r\n  men, continues to carry on a system that has and still continues to\r\n  ruin the prospects of the souls and bodies of thousands of British\r\n  subjects. I have not the ability to represent what I feel on this\r\n  subject, yet I know from my own feelings that it will never carry\r\n  out the wishes of the British people! The spirit of the British\r\n  law is reformation. Now, years of sad experience should have told\r\n  them, that instead of reforming--the wretched man, under the present\r\n  system, led by example on the one hand, and driven by despair and\r\n  tyranny on the other, goes on from bad to worse, till at length he\r\n  is ruined body and soul. Experience, dear bought experience, has\r\n  taught me this. In all my career, I never was cruel--I always felt\r\n  keenly for the miseries of my fellow-creatures, and was ever ready\r\n  to do all in my power to assist them to the utmost, yet my name will\r\n  be handed down to posterity[36] branded with the most opprobrious\r\n  epithet that man can bestow. But 'tis little matter now. I have\r\n  thus given vent to my feelings, knowing that you will bear with me,\r\n  and I know that you have and will exert yourself for the welfare of\r\n  wretched men. It is on this account that I have strove, though in but\r\n  a feeble manner, to express my feelings. The crime for which I am\r\n  to suffer is murder. Reverend Sir, you will shudder at my cruelty,\r\n  but I only took life--those that I deprived of life, though they did\r\n  not in a moment send a man to his last account, inflicted on many a\r\n  lingering death--for years they have tortured men's minds as well\r\n  as their bodies, and after years of mental and bodily torture, sent\r\n  them to a premature grave. This is what I call refined cruelty, and\r\n  it is carried on, and I blush to own it, by Englishmen, and under\r\n  the enlightened English Government. Will it be believed hereafter,\r\n  that this was allowed to be carried on in the nineteenth century?\r\n  I will now proceed to inform you what has happened since I left\r\n  Port Arthur. I was sent to Glenorchy Probation Station. I was then\r\n  determined, if possible, to regain my freedom, and visit my dear\r\n  native country, and see my parents and friends again. I took to the\r\n  bush, with two men; one of them said that he knew the bush well, but\r\n  he deceived me and himself too. Our intention was to take a craft\r\n  from Brown's River; we were disappointed--there was no craft there.\r\n  We then turned to go to Launceston, thinking to get one there, and\r\n  to cross to the Sydney main. But after leaving New Norfolk, I lost\r\n  one of my mates, and the same night the other left me at the Green\r\n  Ponds. I was soon after taken and sent to Hobart Town. I was tried\r\n  and sent to Norfolk Island, and this place is now worse than I can\r\n  describe. Every species of petty tyranny that long experience has\r\n  taught some of these tyrants is put in force by the authorities. The\r\n  men are half-starved, hard worked, and cruelly flogged. These things\r\n  brought on the affair of the first of July, of which you have, no\r\n  doubt, heard. I would send you the whole account, but that I know you\r\n  will have it from better hands than mine. I am sorry that this will\r\n  give you great pain, as there are several of the men that have been\r\n  under your charge at Port Arthur concerned in this affair. Sir, on\r\n  the 21st of September, 1846, Mr. Brown arrived in the Island with a\r\n  commission to form a Court, and try the men. On the 23rd of September\r\n  he opened the Court. Fourteen men were then arraigned for the murder\r\n  of John Morris, that was formerly gate-keeper at Port Arthur. This\r\n  trial occupied the Court nine days. The Jury retired, and returned\r\n  a verdict, and found twelve out of fourteen guilty of murder. On\r\n  the 5th of October the sentence of death was then passed on us, and\r\n  to be carried into effect on the 13th of October, 1846. Sir, the\r\n  strong ties of earth will soon be wrenched, and the burning fever\r\n  of this life will soon be quenched, and my grave will be a haven--a\r\n  resting-place for me, William Westwood. Sir, out of the bitter cup of\r\n  misery I have drunk from my sixteenth year--ten long years--and the\r\n  sweetest draught is that which takes away the misery of living death;\r\n  it is the friend that deceives no man; all will then be quiet--no\r\n  tyrant will there disturb my repose, I hope, William Westwood.\r\n\r\n  Sir, I now bid the world adieu, and all it contains.\r\n\r\n William Westwood, his writing.\r\n\r\nBeneath the letter is printed as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _The Dying Declaration of William Westwood, alias \"Jackey Jackey.\"_\r\n\r\n  \"I, William Westwood, wish to die in the Communion of Christ's Holy\r\n  Church, seeking mercy of God through Jesus Christ our Lord and\r\n  Saviour.--Amen.\r\n\r\n  I wish to say, as a dying man, that I believe four men now\r\n  going to suffer are innocent of the crime laid to their charge,\r\n  viz.:--Lawrence Kavanagh, Henry Whiting, William Pickthorne, and\r\n  William Scrimshaw. I declare that I never spoke to Kavanagh on the\r\n  morning of the riots; and these other three men had no part in the\r\n  killing of John Morris as far as I know of. I have never spoke a\r\n  disrespectful word of any man since my confinement. I die in charity\r\n  with all men, and now I ask your prayers for my soul!\"\r\n\r\n William Westwood, aged twenty-six years.\r\n\r\nJackey Jackey, at the time of his death, was twenty-six years of age.\r\nHe was 5 feet 9 inches in height, with fair hair, blue eyes, and a\r\nruddy complexion.\r\n\r\nShortly after the death of these men, Mr. John Price, superintendent of\r\nPort Arthur, was sent to Norfolk Island with instructions to break up\r\nthe settlement and remove the prisoners to Van Diemen's Land, and this\r\nwas gradually effected. Two or three years later the Government of the\r\nIsland was again transferred to the Governor of New South Wales, and\r\nin 1857, about two hundred of the Pitcairn Islanders--the descendants\r\nof the Mutineers of the _Bounty_ were landed there and have remained\r\nunmolested to the present time, and the later history of this beautiful\r\nisland may be summed up in the one word \"peace.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Launceston Chronicle._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: \"Posperity\" in the paper is so obviously a typographical\r\nerror that I have taken the liberty of correcting it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  The Third Epoch of Bushranging; the Gold Digging Era; Influx of\r\n  Convicts from Van Diemen's Land; Passing of the Criminals' Influx\r\n  Prevention Act; Attitude of the Diggers Towards the Bushrangers, and\r\n  Other Thieves; The Nelson Gold Robbery; Some Pitiful Stories; A Rapid\r\n  Raid; Insecurity of the Melbourne Streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the next stage in the story of the bushrangers,\r\nit may be advisable to say something of the vast change which suddenly\r\ntook place in the conditions in Australia about this time. In 1842-3\r\nthe colony of New South Wales was plunged into a financial crisis,\r\nabout which it is unnecessary to say much here, but from which the\r\ncolony was only beginning to recover in 1851. Wages were still very\r\nlow, and numbers of men were out of work. In April, 1851, the news that\r\ngold had been discovered at Summerhill Creek, in the Bathurst district,\r\nroused something like a ferment in the colony. Men employed in Sydney\r\nthrew down their tools to \"go to the diggings.\" There was a general\r\nexodus from the coast cities and towns to the ranges, then considered\r\nfar away in the interior. Wages jumped from about one shilling per day\r\nfor labour to ten or more, meat rose from one penny per pound, for the\r\nbest cuts, to sixpence. The roads leading to Orange, the Turon, and\r\nother early goldfields in New South Wales, were thronged by men, either\r\ngoing to the diggings to seek their fortune, or returning disappointed.\r\nIn July, 1851, the Port Phillip district of New South Wales was erected\r\ninto the independent colony of Victoria, and in August the news that\r\ngold had been struck in the Ballarat district of the newly-established\r\ncolony turned the tide of gold-seekers in that direction. The police\r\nestablishment, with which the new colony started, was merely that\r\nof an outlying district of a huge sparsely-populated colony, and was\r\nwholly inadequate to the requirements.\r\n\r\nThere were two gaols in the colony; one at Melbourne, the other at\r\nGeelong; neither of them very large. The Geelong gaol, in fact, was\r\nlittle more than a lock-up, and it was only within the past two years\r\nthat the gaol had been enclosed within a high wall. In 1850 it stood\r\nout on the hill, a short distance from the banks of the Barwon River,\r\nan ordinary-looking brick building, with the Governor's House and\r\nother offices grouped near it, and all opening out directly on the\r\nlevel flat which stretched from the top of the banks of the Barwon\r\nRiver to the hill on which the main portion of the town of Geelong was\r\nsituated. On the top of this hill, the last building in that direction,\r\nin \"old Geelong\"--as it was called, although it had only been founded\r\nabout twelve years before--was the court house, and there was no other\r\nbuilding along Yarra Street, on the southern side of the hill and\r\nacross the little flat (a distance altogether of about half-a-mile)\r\nuntil the gaol was reached. The Melbourne gaol stood on what was\r\nthen the boundary of the city of Melbourne. It was a larger and more\r\nimposing building than the Geelong gaol, but still wholly inadequate\r\nfor the requirements; and therefore one of the first duties of the\r\nLegislative Council of the new colony was to provide accommodation\r\nfor evil doers, who could no longer be sent to the gaols of Sydney to\r\nserve out their terms of punishment. This was done by the establishment\r\nof \"stockades\" at Collingwood and Pentridge, both near Melbourne,\r\nand the purchase of two old trading vessels, the _President_ and the\r\n_Success_, in September, 1852, to be converted into convict hulks for\r\nthe safe keeping of the more desperate of the malefactors. Subsequently\r\nthree other hulks were added to the list, and these were in use for\r\nmany years after large prisons had been erected at Melbourne, Geelong,\r\nBallarat, Bendigo, and other centres of population.\r\n\r\nLooking back from the present time it appears to me that the Colonial\r\nOffice was guilty of a serious tactical blunder in appointing Mr.\r\nCharles Joseph Latrobe, as the first Governor of Victoria. He had been\r\nappointed Resident Magistrate, or Superintendent, of the Port Phillip\r\nDistrict in 1839; and, during the agitation for the separation of that\r\ndistrict from the huge colony of which it was a part, Mr. Latrobe, very\r\nnaturally perhaps, did all that he could to prevent the inhabitants\r\nfrom gaining their end. As a consequence, he was perhaps the best\r\nhated man that has ever lived in Australia. He was usually called \"the\r\nGovernor's poodle,\" and was denounced in no measured terms by the\r\nadvocates of separation. When that was carried, and Mr. Latrobe became\r\nLieutenant Governor, his harsh treatment of the diggers nearly drove\r\nthem into rebellion. This is not the place to give the history of the\r\nBallarat riot, but some reference to it is necessary. A most exorbitant\r\nlicence fee was imposed on all residents on proclaimed goldfields,\r\nand this tax was collected in a most arbitrary and brutal manner.\r\nThere were no gaols nor lock-ups on the diggings at the time, and men\r\narrested for all sorts of offences--murder, bushranging, stealing, or\r\nthe non-payment of licence fees--were simply fastened with handcuffs\r\nto a bullock chain attached to a tree stump by a huge staple. Later\r\nsome boxes, made of corrugated iron, were put up as cells and these\r\nwere known as \"the Dutch ovens,\" or \"the sardine boxes,\" and prisoners\r\nconfined in them on hot summer nights suffered tortures, and begged\r\nto be put \"on the chain\" as a relief. Mr. Latrobe, therefore, soon\r\ncame to be as cordially hated by the new comers as he had been by the\r\nolder inhabitants of the district. But whatever may be said as to the\r\nharshness of his treatment of the gold diggers, the efforts he made\r\nto check the lawlessness rampant in the colony cannot be too highly\r\ncommended. He and the Legislative Council organised a fine body of\r\npolice in a very short time. The horse police were as well-disciplined\r\nand mounted as any similar body in any part of the world, but allowing\r\nfor their efficiency, it would have been impossible for them to repress\r\nlawlessness so rapidly and completely as they did, had they not been\r\nassisted by the attitude of the general public. I may be wrong perhaps,\r\nbut it has always appeared to me that the antagonism between the free\r\nand the convict elements in the population of which I have already\r\nspoken was continued long after the abolition of the convict system,\r\nand even passed on to those who landed in the country during the rush\r\nto the diggings. There was a general tendency at the time to credit\r\nall sorts of misdeeds to the convicts. No doubt, among the enormous\r\ncrowds which landed in Victoria in the early years of the rush to the\r\ndiggings, there was a fair admixture of rough and reckless characters\r\nwho were not convicts, but it was the custom to assume that all crimes\r\nwere committed by the \"old hands,\" and that any man arrested for any\r\ncriminal offence had been \"sent out.\" Thus, when Mr. Lachlan M'Lachlan\r\nwas appointed police magistrate of Bendigo, he merely expressed openly\r\nthe opinion held by other magistrates, and the public generally, when\r\nhe declared that nearly all thefts were perpetrated by \"old hands.\"\r\nHe asserted that he could distinguish a convict from a free man at\r\na glance. He would order the police to make the prisoner walk down\r\nthe court, and would exclaim: \"Turn him round again, sergeant. Ah!\r\nI thought so! I can see the marks of the irons on his legs.\"[37] By\r\nwhich he meant that the man had acquired a sort of limp through wearing\r\nirons, and that he could detect it. All such men were sent to gaol for\r\nsix or twelve months, not so much for the crime or offence with which\r\nthey stood charged, as because they were ex-convicts. And generally\r\nthe public endorsed this apparent injustice. \"It's a pity we ain't got\r\nmore magistrates like Bendigo Mac,\" was an expression frequently heard\r\nin all parts of the colony. It is not impossible that the fashion of\r\ncrediting all crimes and offences to convicts, however unjust it may\r\nhave been, tended to prevent others from committing crimes. Whether\r\nthis was so or not, it is certain that the diggers, rough and careless\r\nas the majority of them were, steadily set their faces, as a class,\r\nagainst crime, and never hesitated, even during the height of their\r\ndispute with the authorities, to hand over to the police any person\r\ndetected in stealing. Probably they were forced into this attitude in\r\nself-defence. The diggings were merely huge camps, everybody living\r\nin tents or \"houses\" made of wooden rafters and uprights, covered\r\nwith calico or canvas. Even the big hotels and theatres were calico\r\nstructures. It was so easy for an evil-disposed person to rip open a\r\ntent and thrust his hand under the pillow or into any other place where\r\nhe thought gold might be concealed. But such thefts, although numerous,\r\nconstituted only a minority of the crimes committed on the goldfields.\r\nAll round were holes twenty or thirty feet deep, and the paths from one\r\npart of the field to another wound in and out between these holes, so\r\nthat it was dangerous for a stranger in the locality to travel about\r\nafter dark. In such a place it was so easy to stab a man and throw\r\nhis body down a hole that the very facilities offered operated as a\r\ntemptation to murder. Scarcely a day passed without a body being found\r\nmurdered and rifled, and thus a peculiar sort of morality was developed\r\non the diggings, and the diggers, while resisting the police, jeering\r\nat them and showing their hatred of them in every possible way, still\r\nassisted them in capturing thieves and other criminals. It was the\r\ncustom to call public meetings for political and other purposes, by\r\nsending men to all the various camps each carrying a tin dish. These\r\nheralds would beat their tin dishes and yell, \"Roll up! roll up!\"\r\nFrequently a \"roll up\" was called for the purpose of organising a party\r\nto hunt down thieves or other evil-doers, and very soon the \"roll up\"\r\ncarried terror through the ranks of tent thieves and other robbers.\r\nSometimes the delinquent when caught was cuffed and beaten and ordered\r\noff the diggings on pain of death, but, as a rule, he was marched to\r\nthe police camp, popularly known as \"The Camp,\" and handed over for\r\ntrial. It was perhaps because of this attitude of the diggers, that\r\n\"Lynch law\" did not become an institution in Victoria, as it had in\r\nCalifornia. On more than one occasion, it was proposed that thieves,\r\nrobbers, and murderers should be summarily dealt with by their captors,\r\nbut such resolutions were not endorsed at the \"rolls up\"; although, on\r\nmore than one occasion, it was said that if the Government could not\r\nprotect the diggers from bushrangers, the diggers would have to protect\r\nthemselves. Some of the old names, now rapidly disappearing, record\r\nthe character which the neighbourhood once bore. Thus \"Murderer's\r\nFlat,\" the old name of a portion of the Mount Alexander Goldfield,\r\nis almost forgotten. The flat is now a portion of the pretty little\r\nmining and agricultural town of Castlemaine. It was the custom here\r\nin the \"roaring fifties,\" for the diggers to fire off their guns and\r\npistols every night after sundown, and ostentatiously reload them, as\r\na caution that any person seen prowling round the tents during the\r\nnight would be shot without further notice. In many of the outlying\r\ngullies on the Bendigo and Ballarat Goldfields the same ceremony was\r\nperformed nightly. Beyond the limits of the goldfields the roads were\r\ninfested by footpads and bushrangers, who hated the diggers for their\r\nantagonism to their class. To these the digger was fair game. It was\r\npopularly supposed that these bushrangers were all convicts from \"Van\r\nDiemen's Land,\" hence they were known as \"Van Demonians,\" \"Derwenters\"\r\nfrom the River Derwent, and \"Tother siders.\" The newspapers were full\r\nof references to their doings. The _Geelong Advertiser_ of June 2nd,\r\n1851, warned the public that \"large numbers of men--half bushranger,\r\nhalf gold-seeker--are travelling along the roads, especially the Sydney\r\nroad, robbing all who are unprotected.\" These were said to be Van\r\nDemonians who had landed in Geelong or Melbourne, and who were making\r\ntheir way to the goldfields of New South Wales. In the same month the\r\n_Melbourne Herald_ published several articles calling the attention of\r\nthe authorities to the large \"influx of Van Diemen's Land expirees who\r\nare thronging into Port Phillip.\" These \"villains,\" it was said, were\r\ntravelling along all the roads which led to the diggings on the Sydney\r\nside, and lived by plundering honest travellers. On June 23rd the mail\r\ncoach was bailed up at Bruce's Creek, between Portland and Geelong. The\r\ncoach, with three passengers on board, was going down the hill to the\r\ncrossing-place, when two men stepped from behind gum trees, presented\r\ntheir pistols, and cried \"Bail up.\" The driver, William Freere, instead\r\nof complying, began to flog his horses, but before they could respond\r\ntheir heads were seized by one of the bushrangers, while the other put\r\nhis pistol to Freere's head, and threatened to blow his brains out.\r\nThe coach was taken some distance off the road, and its occupants were\r\ntied to trees. The robbers went very leisurely through the letters, and\r\nwhen all that was of value had been abstracted one of the bushrangers\r\ntook a saddle and bridle belonging to one of the passengers (Mr. Thomas\r\nGibson) and set it aside with the remark, \"Ah, this is just what I\r\nwanted.\" This bushranger was dressed \"in a black suit of fashionable\r\ncut, and wore black kid gloves.\" He was afterwards identified as Owen\r\nSuffolk, while his companion was Christopher Farrell. Suffolk took one\r\nof the coach-horses, put the saddle and bridle on, and mounted. Farrell\r\njumped on the other horse barebacked. The tied men begged hard to be\r\nlet loose, offering to swear that they would not give information to\r\nthe police, or move from the spot until their captors were away, but\r\ntheir supplications were only laughed at. The road was at that time but\r\nlittle frequented, and the next mail, which might possibly be the first\r\nvehicle to pass, would not come for a week. Moreover, they were out of\r\nsight of the road. The struggle to get free was therefore a struggle\r\nfor life, and it was a severe one. Mr. Gibson was the first to get one\r\nhand loose. After this the rest was comparatively easy. In less than an\r\nhour they were all free, and they walked straight to the township at\r\nBruce's Creek to tell the police. The robbers were caught in Geelong a\r\nday or two later. Suffolk was strolling along the beach near the wharf,\r\nand Farrell was found in a boarding-house not far away. They were\r\nsentenced to ten years' penal servitude, the first three in irons.\r\n\r\nJames Mason and John Browne, two diggers, were sitting at their camp\r\nat Bendigo having supper, when a man named William Scott passed along,\r\ngoing towards the \"township.\" They invited him to \"sit down and have a\r\nfeed,\" as he looked tired, and he did so. But while eating he slipped\r\nhis hand under the edge of the tent and took out a bag containing 110\r\nounces of gold. The gold was missed before he was out of sight, and he\r\nwas followed immediately and captured. He was taken to \"the camp,\" and\r\nsubsequently sent to gaol for five years.\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 1852, the _Melbourne Herald_ reported that \"a gang of\r\nVandemonians have kept the road between Bendigo and Eaglehawk Gully for\r\nthree days, robbing all who passed.\" The police were sent out and the\r\ngang was broken up. One was shot and three others traced to Halliday's\r\nInn at Kyneton, where they were captured. They had thirty-three pounds\r\nweight of gold in their possession, and were taken on to Melbourne for\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nSuch reports were so frequent that the Legislative Council was\r\ncompelled to take action, and as a consequence the Act known as the\r\nCriminals' Influx Prevention Act (18 Vic., No. 3) was passed in\r\nNovember. This Act was specially designed to keep ex-convicts out\r\nof the colony. It was impossible to prevent those from New South\r\nWales from crossing the Murray River, but it no doubt checked the\r\ninflux of the more desperate criminals from Van Diemen's Land, where\r\ntransportation was continued for many years after it had ceased to New\r\nSouth Wales. But although the Act prevented ex-convicts from landing\r\nat Victorian ports it could not prevent them landing at Sydney or\r\nAdelaide and walking overland to the Victorian diggings. In spite of\r\nthis, however, the Act was undoubtedly very efficacious in checking\r\nthe landing of criminally-minded persons. There were, however, so many\r\nin the colony previously to the passing of the Act that the police had\r\nplenty of employment in hunting them down.\r\n\r\nOn February 6th, Corporal Harvey, of the mounted police, was searching\r\nsome boxes at the Police Barracks, Buninyong, to ascertain whether\r\nthey contained gold. A man named Goldman threatened to shoot him if he\r\ntouched his box. The trooper simply replied \"I must do my duty,\" and\r\nopened the box. Goldman shot him at once. This crime was a purposeless\r\none. The trooper had been ordered to remove gold from all boxes left\r\nat the station so that it might be sent down to Geelong by escort. The\r\nonly excuse which can be made for Goldman is that the diggers were very\r\nsensitive where their gold was concerned and were also very ready to\r\nprotect it even at the risk of murder. But the boxes were left there\r\nin charge of the police, and any man who objected to his box being\r\nsearched had no right to take it there. However, Goldman was convicted\r\nof murder and hung.\r\n\r\nOn February 23rd, Elliott Aitchison, a squatter, was robbed near\r\nBuninyong. The robber took horse, saddle, bridle, saddle-bags, watch, a\r\nbill of exchange for £30, and some money. The bushranger was identified\r\nas a man named Edward Melville, who had been working for a neighbouring\r\nsquatter, Mr. Winter, of Winter's Flat, and was well known in the\r\ndistrict. A reward of £30 was offered for his apprehension.\r\n\r\nThe ship _Nelson_ arrived at Geelong from London in March, 1852, where\r\nshe landed her passengers and cargo and took on board some cargo for\r\nher return voyage. She was then taken round to Hobson's Bay to fill\r\nup. On the night of April 1st she was lying off Liardet's Beach, near\r\nwhere the South Melbourne pier now stands. There were on board Mr.\r\nDraper, the mate in charge, Mr. Davis, second officer of the _Royal\r\nGeorge_ lying at anchor near, three seamen, three passengers, and the\r\ncook. At about two a.m. they were roused by loud calls, and as each one\r\ncame out of his cabin to ascertain what the row was about he was seized\r\nand lashed to the bulwarks. When all had been secured the robber who\r\nappeared to be leader untied Mr. Draper and ordered him to show where\r\nthe gold was. The mate refused. The robber fired and wounded him in\r\nthe side. He then threatened to shoot him dead next time he refused.\r\nAnother of the gang prodded Mr. Draper behind with a sword, and,\r\nrealising that resistance was useless, he led the way to the lazarette.\r\nThe door was soon broken down, and twenty-three boxes containing 8183\r\noz. of gold, valued at about £25,000, were taken out and carried on\r\ndeck. \"I say, mates,\" exclaimed the leader, \"this is the best----\r\ndiggings we've seen yet.\" The boxes were lowered over the vessel's side\r\ninto boats, and then the men tied to the bulwarks were unloosed, their\r\nhands tied behind them, and they were marched into the lazarette. The\r\nentrance was closed up with the broken boards nailed across. When the\r\nstevedore and his men arrived some hours later to go on with their work\r\nthe prisoners in the lazarette were released, and information was given\r\nto the police. The robbers were said to have numbered about twenty. A\r\nsearch proved that two of Mr. Liardet's boats had been removed from\r\ntheir moorings. They were found far away along the beach, and it was\r\nconjectured that these boats had been used by the robbers. A reward was\r\noffered by the Government of £250 for the capture and conviction of the\r\nrobbers, and this was supplemented by a further reward of £500 offered\r\nby Messrs. Jackson, Rae & Co., the consigners of the gold. Within a few\r\ndays John James, alias Johnston, was arrested in Melbourne, and shortly\r\nafterwards James Morgan and James Duncan were found at the Ocean Child\r\nInn, Williamstown. They were in bed, and when the police entered the\r\nroom Morgan exclaimed: \"If we'd known you was---- traps we'd a' blown\r\nyour ---- brains out.\" When taken to the lock-up he said: \"We may be\r\nsentenced, but we'll live to dance on your ---- grave, and have 2000\r\na nob to ride in our carriages.\" At the trial it was said that they\r\nhad been concerned in several highway robberies on the Keilor Plains\r\nand in the Black Forest, but these cases were not gone into. They were\r\nconvicted of having stolen the gold from the _Nelson_, and sentenced to\r\nfifteen years' hard labour, the first three in irons.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1852 was an exceptionally severe one, and snow fell\r\nheavily in the ranges. A bullock driver who was looking for his\r\nbullocks near Buninyong was bailed up by three armed men. Although it\r\nwas snowing at the time they stripped him and tied him to a tree while\r\nthey searched his clothes. Finding only about five shillings in his\r\npockets they cast him loose, gave him his clothes and money, with the\r\nremark that they thought he \"was a---- digger from Ballarat.\" A few\r\nmiles further along the road they met a party of real diggers and took\r\nfrom them 8 oz. of gold and an escort receipt for 84 oz. more.\r\n\r\nSuch robberies as these were reported daily on the roads round\r\nBallarat, Bendigo, and Mount Alexander. Perhaps the worst places were\r\nthe Stoney Rises, on the road from Geelong to Ballarat, and the Black\r\nForest, between Melbourne and Mount Alexander. But the conditions even\r\nin Melbourne were not much better than elsewhere. On August 6, 1852, a\r\ndigger who had just returned from Bendigo was knocked down in Little\r\nCollins Street, Melbourne, and the pocket of his trousers cut out.\r\nHe, however, lost only a few shillings, while the robbers missed 3lb.\r\nweight of gold which he held clutched in his hand.\r\n\r\nJudge Barry and Mr. Wrixon, the barrister, left the Supreme Court House\r\ntogether on August 11, at about half-past eight p.m. When they were\r\nnear St Francis' R.C. Church, Lonsdale Street, they heard a shout for\r\nhelp. Ploughing through the deep mud they stampeded three robbers who\r\nhad got a man down in the gutter. At that time the streets of Melbourne\r\nwere not paved as they are now and the judge and the barrister nearly\r\ngot bogged while pulling the digger out of the mud hole in which he was\r\nnearly smothered. The robbers escaped, but the digger found his gold\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nMr. John Scraggs was going home to his house in Richmond one evening.\r\nWhen passing a corner near his own residence he received a blow on\r\nthe head and fell stunned. When he recovered consciousness his watch,\r\nchain, ring, and purse had disappeared. The next day he purchased a\r\nrevolver, loaded it carefully, and carried it in his hand ready for\r\nuse as he went home. He was specially vigilant when he approached the\r\ncorner where he had been knocked down before. Probably he was rather\r\ntoo vigilant on one side. However that may be, he received a blow on\r\nthe other side which \"stretched\" him again. That time the robbers only\r\ngot a revolver, and Mr. Scraggs swore that they should get no more\r\nfirearms from him.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the _Melbourne Herald_ reported a case of\r\na captain of a vessel lying in Hobson's Bay. The captain had been to\r\nthe theatre and was walking to Liardet's Beach to get a boat to take\r\nhim on board his ship, when he was knocked down in Flinders Street and\r\ndragged into a right-of-way. Here he was stripped stark naked and left\r\ninsensible. It was early morning when he regained his senses. After\r\nsome hesitation he walked towards an hotel, hoping to be able to borrow\r\nsome clothes there, but he was pounced on by a vigilant policeman and\r\ntaken off to the lock-up. His story was not believed and he was taken\r\ninto court and charged with \"indecent behaviour,\" which was adding\r\ninsult to injury, and the magistrate remanded him till next morning,\r\nto allow enquiries to be made, bail being refused. Later on, when it\r\nwas ascertained that he really was the captain of a vessel, he was\r\ndischarged. The _Herald_ cited this as an instance of the vagaries of\r\npolice magistrates, and charged the police with being unable to protect\r\nthe public against robbers.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the knights of the road. A pitiful story was told of\r\nan old man and his son who had left their work in Melbourne, and gone\r\nto the diggings to \"make their pile.\" They were unsuccessful, like\r\na good many more, and started to walk back to Melbourne, to return\r\nto their ordinary work. They were bailed up on the edge of the Black\r\nForest. The bushrangers refused to believe that they had no gold. It\r\nwas a stale trick, they said, to throw a bag of gold behind a log and\r\nswear they hadn't got any, and then go back and pick it up, when the\r\nbushrangers had gone away. It was in vain that the old man swore that\r\nhe had had no gold to throw away. One of the bushrangers compelled\r\nhim to hold out his hand and fired a bullet through the palm. As he\r\ncontinued to declare he had no gold the bushranger was about to shoot\r\nthrough the palm of the other hand, when the boy made a rush at him and\r\nwas shot dead by the other bushranger. The old man was then allowed\r\nto go on his sorrowful way. Bushranging was the common subject of\r\nconversation. Little else was talked of, and even the children played\r\nbushranger. Two young lads, who were old enough to know better, thought\r\nit would be good fun to \"stick up\" their father. He was a farmer living\r\non the Barrabool Hills, about eight or nine miles from Geelong. He went\r\ninto town with some produce and was returning at nightfall when, at\r\nabout half a-mile from his own gateway, he was ordered to \"bail up\" by\r\ntwo persons on horseback. Without hesitation he snatched up a gun from\r\nthe bottom of the dray and fired. One of the bushrangers fell and the\r\nother cried out \"Oh, father, you've shot Johnny! We were only in fun.\"\r\nIt was too late. The father's aim had been too sure and the boy was\r\ntaken home to his mother dead.\r\n\r\nOn October 24th, 1852, Henry Johnston, John Finegan, John Donovan,\r\nCharles Bowe, and John Baylie, known as the Eureka gang, were tried\r\nfor highway robbery in Melbourne. William Cook said he was riding from\r\nMelbourne to Bendigo, on August 4th, when near Aitken's Gap he was\r\nbailed up by Finegan and Donovan. Three other men sat on their horses\r\nsome distance away along the road, but did not interfere. One of the\r\nbushrangers held a pistol to his head, while the other stripped him\r\nnaked and searched his clothes. He also felt him all over, under the\r\narmpits and elsewhere. They took £2 14S. and a pistol from him. Finegan\r\nwanted to take everything, but Donovan would not agree to that, but\r\ngave him back his clothes. Then he returned one of the £1 notes and\r\nthe fourteen shillings in silver. Wesley Anderson identified Baylie\r\nand Donovan as the two men who had robbed him on a Sunday in August,\r\nnear Buninyong. The proceedings were very similar to those in the first\r\ncase. All the other prisoners were identified in a similar way by other\r\nwitnesses. The robberies were effected over a wide range of country,\r\nand were all of a similar character. When asked what they had to say\r\nin defence, one of the prisoners asked the Judge whether he thought\r\nthey were crows? \"Here's one man,\" he continued, \"says we stuck him up\r\nat Aitken's Gap, another at the Porcupine, another near Mount Egerton,\r\nand others at other places, and the police says they caught us in the\r\nCrown Hotel, Buninyong. Why, your Honour, horses couldn't get over the\r\nground in the time.\" The jury, however, seemed to have formed a better\r\nopinion of the power of the bushrangers' horses than the bushranger\r\nhimself. Perhaps this was due to the fact that some of them at least\r\nhad exchanged horses with their victims. However that may be, they were\r\nall found guilty. Finegan and Donovan, who appeared to have been the\r\nleaders, and to have taken part in the majority of the robberies, were\r\nsent to gaol for twelve years, and the others for six years each.\r\n\r\nThe Geelong mail was stuck up in December, 1852, between the old Burial\r\nGround and the Flagstaff Hill, now in the very heart of Melbourne. The\r\nrobbers took watches, rings, and money from the passengers, but did not\r\ndismount from their horses nor interfere with the mail bags. Probably\r\nit was too close to the city.\r\n\r\nOn December 26th two diggers returning to Melbourne were robbed near\r\nKeilor by three armed men on horseback, who took a large parcel of gold\r\ndust and an escort receipt for more. On the same day a man was brutally\r\nbeaten on the Sydney road, about fifteen miles from Melbourne, and\r\nrobbed of his watch, some gold specimens and nuggets, and his money.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: \"Mr. Lachlan McLachlan, or 'Bendigo Mac,' as he was more\r\nfamiliarly styled, administered the law with a vigour and severity\r\nwhich brought upon him censure from many quarters ... but 'desperate\r\nevils require desperate remedies.' ... When an old hand happened to be\r\namong the prisoners, he would be terrified by the fierce reprobation\r\nof 'Bendigo Mac,' or by the glare which shot from that inevitable\r\neyeglass.... At other times he would say to a prisoner, 'This district\r\nis not big enough for both you and me. One of us must leave--which\r\nshall it be?' The prisoner would feel, of course, that there was very\r\nlittle doubt about the matter, and would promise to make himself\r\nscarce, requesting probably a couple of days' grace to wash up a bit of\r\nwashdirt.\" \"History of Bendigo,\" by George Mackay, chap. III.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  Captain Melville Takes to the Road; He Ties and Robs Eighteen Men;\r\n  He Goes to Geelong for a Spree, and Boasts of His Exploits; His\r\n  Sensational Capture; Sent to the Hulks; Murder of Corporal Owens;\r\n  Melville Removed from the Hulk _Success_ to the Gaol; Murder of Mr.\r\n  John Price and Mutiny of the Convicts; Melville Attacks Mr. Wintle;\r\n  Death of the Noted Bushranger.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the bushrangers of the \"roaring fifties\" none was more talked\r\nof than Frank McCallum, alias Captain Melville. Every now and then,\r\nduring the latter half of the year 1852, stories were told of daring\r\nrobberies committed by Captain Melville, and rewards were offered for\r\nthe capture of the captain, dead or alive, or any person who aided and\r\nabetted him. On December 18th, 1852, he rode up to a sheep station near\r\nWardy Yallock and asked Mr. Wilson, the overseer, who was the owner?\r\n\"Mr. Aitcheson,\" was the reply. \"Is he at home?\" asked Melville; and\r\non being answered in the affirmative he expressed a wish to see him.\r\nMr. Wilson having no suspicion as to who the civilly spoken visitor\r\nwas went into the house and returned with Mr. Aitcheson. Melville drew\r\nout a pistol, pointed it towards them, and ordered them to \"put up\"\r\ntheir hands. The two gentlemen complied at once and were marched to\r\nthe woolshed. Here they found the sixteen shearers and other workmen\r\nsitting in a row down the middle of the shearing floor and William\r\nRoberts, Melville's mate, standing sentry over them pistol in hand.\r\nAitcheson and Wilson were conducted to the head of the row and ordered\r\nto seat themselves, which they did. Melville then searched about until\r\nhe found a rope. This he cut into lengths and then mounted guard while\r\nRoberts called the prisoners out one by one and tied them to the\r\nfence. Mr. Aitcheson asked Melville what he wanted? and the bushranger\r\nreplied, \"Gold and horses, and we're going to get them.\" When all the\r\nmen were securely tied the bushrangers cautioned them not to attempt\r\nto get loose until permission was given, and then walked to the house.\r\nMelville told Mrs. Aitcheson not to be afraid, as he never interfered\r\nwith ladies any more than was necessary. He told all the women and\r\ngirls to go into one room. One of the women was told to get some food\r\nready, and part of this was taken, with two bottles of brandy, to the\r\nmen at the shed. Melville and Roberts both ate heartily. They searched\r\nthe house thoroughly, and took all the money and jewellery they could\r\nfind. They picked out two fine horses with saddles and bridles, and\r\nwhen mounted they stopped at the woolshed to bid good-bye to Mr.\r\nAitcheson and their \"other friends,\" and to inform them that Mrs.\r\nAitcheson would come and untie them as soon as he and his mate were out\r\nof sight along the road.\r\n\r\nThe boldness with which this robbery was conceived and carried out\r\ncaused quite an excitement throughout the colony. The idea of eighteen\r\nmen permitting two to tie and rob them without a struggle caused\r\nas much amusement perhaps as wonder. People talked of little else\r\nfor days, and everywhere the question was asked, \"What next?\" This,\r\nhowever, was not all. After leaving the station the bushrangers only\r\ntravelled a few miles and camped in the bush. The following morning\r\nthey stuck up two diggers, Thomas Wearne and William Madden, on the\r\nBallarat Road, and robbed them of £33. After taking the money, Melville\r\nasked them where they were going. \"To Geelong to see our friends, and\r\nspend Christmas. But now we shall have to go back to the diggings,\" was\r\nthe reply. Melville drew Roberts apart, and after a brief conversation\r\nhe came back, handed the diggers a £10 note, and hoped that would be\r\nsufficient to enable them to enjoy their holidays. During the next few\r\ndays the bushrangers stuck up and robbed a large number of travellers\r\non the Ballarat Road, travelling themselves towards Geelong at the\r\ntime. On the morning of the 24th, they stuck up and robbed a man near\r\nFyan's Ford, about five miles from the town, and then rode straight\r\ninto Geelong. They put up at an hotel in Corio Street, where they\r\nhad dinner and saw that their horses were fed. Then they went to a\r\nhouse of ill-fame, a little off the street, and not far from the\r\nCorio Street lock-up. One of the women was sent to a public-house in\r\nMoorabool Street for some bottles of brandy, and the spree began. The\r\nliquor opened Melville's mouth, and he informed one of the women who\r\nhe was, and boasted of his exploits. This woman told the others, and\r\nas there was a hundred pounds reward offered for \"such information as\r\nwould lead to his apprehension,\" the chance of making money was too\r\ngood to be missed. One of the women put her arms round his neck and\r\ntalked to him, while another slipped out by the back door and went to\r\nthe police station to inform the police as to the character of their\r\nvisitors. Somehow Melville became suspicious. He suddenly pushed the\r\nwoman away, and called to Roberts to go and fetch the horses, swearing\r\nthat he would leave the town at once. Roberts, however, was too drunk\r\nto heed him. He was asleep with his head resting on the table. Melville\r\njumped up and shook him, but finding that he could not rouse him,\r\nresolved to go alone. He opened the front door and saw a woman with\r\ntwo policemen just entering the gate. Slamming the door to hurriedly,\r\nhe rushed across the room, and seizing a chair, dashed it through the\r\nback window. Then, jumping clear through the opening thus made, he\r\nraced down the yard to the back fence and climbed over in time to meet\r\nanother constable, who was hurrying up towards the back of the house.\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation Melville knocked the policeman down, and\r\nran across a piece of vacant land. His first intention had, of course,\r\nbeen to go for his horse, but on reaching Corio Street after this\r\nenforced détour, he knew he would have to pass the lock-up to reach the\r\nstable where his horse was. This was too dangerous, and he took the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nOn its western side Geelong proper--that is, the older part of the\r\ntown--is separated from its western portion by a deep gulley, which in\r\nearly times was closed up by a dam. The water thus penned back spread\r\nover a flat, and served to supply the first settlers with water. In\r\n1852 the dam was still there, and formed the roadway which connected\r\nGeelong with Ashby, Kildare, and other suburbs. It was across this\r\ndam that all the traffic on that side of the town passed. At short\r\ndistances away the Melbourne and Ballarat roads branched off, the one\r\nalong the banks of the bay, and the other towards the Bellpost Hill.\r\nA few years later the dam was cut away, and a handsome iron bridge\r\nerected across the deep gulley, while the space formerly covered with\r\nwater was converted into a park or garden.\r\n\r\nThe dam was in a line with Malop Street, and Melville raced away across\r\nthe vacant lots to that street, followed by several policemen. It was\r\nnear sundown, and as Melville came to the dam Mr. Guy was returning\r\nfrom his afternoon ride. Mr. Guy was a young gentleman who had not\r\nbeen long in the colony. He was lodging at the Black Bull Inn, Malop\r\nStreet, where the most extensive stables in the district were. The\r\nBlack Bull was a great sporting house and there were always some race\r\nhorses there, either in training or waiting for engagements; and, as\r\nMr. Guy was an excellent horseman, he frequently took one or other of\r\nthese horses out for an airing. On this occasion he had been for a\r\ngallop across the plains to Cowey's Creek, and was walking his horse\r\nquietly back to allow him to get cool. When crossing the dam a man\r\nsuddenly rushed up and seized him by the leg. He was lifted out of the\r\nsaddle, and half fell, half jumped to the ground. He landed on his feet\r\nand rushed round the horse in time to collar the man who was trying to\r\nmount. The horse was a spirited animal and objected strongly to this\r\nsummary change of riders, otherwise, perhaps, the bushranger would\r\nhave got away. He reared and plunged and prevented the bushranger from\r\nmounting. Guy seized the bushranger, and received a heavy blow for his\r\ntrouble, but he held on gamely, and in the struggle the horse broke\r\naway and galloped off to his stable. A moment later the police came\r\nup, and Melville was captured. Mr. Guy was highly complimented for his\r\nplucky fight with so redoubtable an opponent, but he usually replied\r\nthat he wasn't going \"to lose a horse in that manner if he could help\r\nit.\" Of course, he was intensely surprised when he was informed that\r\nhe had captured the notorious bushranger, Captain Melville. Melville\r\nand Roberts were lodged in the \"old gaol\" in \"South Geelong,\" and I\r\nremember going to see \"the bushrangers\" conveyed across the flat and\r\nup the hill to the court-house to stand their trial. They were seated\r\nin a dray, heavily ironed--there was no \"black Maria\" in Geelong in\r\nthose days--and drawn by two horses. There were several armed policemen\r\non the dray, and others marched before and behind. The court-house, of\r\ncourse, was crowded, and, as boys were not admitted, I was not present.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be of interest to notice that at that time there were\r\nstocks outside the Geelong Court-house. They were converted into\r\nfirewood about two years later when the foundations for the new and\r\nlarger court-house were laid. I believe these were the last stocks seen\r\nin Victoria, the Melbourne ones having been destroyed some time before,\r\nwhen the court-house there was enlarged.\r\n\r\nMelville was convicted on three charges of highway robbery, and was\r\nsentenced to twelve years' penal servitude on one and to ten years\r\neach on two other charges, making in all thirty-two years. A number of\r\nother charges were withdrawn. Similar sentences were passed on Roberts,\r\nbut they were made concurrent. Melville was taken by boat from Geelong\r\nto the hulk _President_ in Hobson's Bay, \"until the devilish spirit\r\nhe had for so long a time exhibited appeared to be broken,\" to quote\r\nthe _Melbourne Herald_. Rather more than a year later he was removed\r\nto the hulk _Success_ \"for milder treatment,\" and was permitted to go\r\nashore to work in the Government stone quarry at Point Gellibrand.\r\nAt that time Melville was engaged in translating the Bible into the\r\nlanguage of the Australian aborigines, \"in which he could converse\r\nfluently.\" For more than two years the public heard nothing of Captain\r\nMelville. On October 22nd, 1856, a launch with fifty or sixty convicts\r\non board was being towed from the hulks _Success_ and _Lysander_ to\r\nthe landing-place near the quarry, when Mr. Jackson, the officer in\r\ncharge, observed that the prisoners were crowding towards the bow of\r\nthe launch. He shouted to them to go back and trim the launch. Some\r\nobeyed, but those nearest the bow seized the tow-rope and rapidly\r\npulled the launch up to the stem of the boat which was towing it. Then\r\nthe prisoners began jumping into the boat. Mr. Jackson was hurled into\r\nthe water. Corporal Owen Owens' head was smashed, and he and John\r\nTurner, one of the rowers, were thrown overboard. The other rowers\r\njumped, some on to the wharf, the others into the water. The convicts\r\nseized the oars and pulled rapidly down the bay, Captain Melville\r\nstanding up in the boat, waving the hammer with which it was said Owens\r\nhad been killed, and shouting \"Adieu to Victoria!\" The desperadoes,\r\nhowever, were not to be allowed to escape so easily as they imagined.\r\nThe guard on the hulk _Lysander_ fired at them as they passed, and the\r\nwater-police from Williamstown soon followed and overtook them. Being\r\nthreatened with muskets at close range, and having no arms themselves,\r\nthey surrendered and were towed back quietly to the _Success_. Nine\r\nof the conspirators were tried for mutiny, Melville at his own\r\nrequest being placed first at the bar alone. In the charge sheet he\r\nwas described as Thomas Smith, alias Frank McCallum, alias Captain\r\nMelville, and was said to have been transported to Van Diemen's Land in\r\n1838. This contradicts the many rumours which gained currency about him\r\nduring his bushranging career. That most generally received was that\r\nhe had come to the colony in charge of an emigrant ship from England,\r\nand that he and his crew had deserted her and gone to the diggings,\r\nwhere, being unlucky, he had taken to bushranging. This report was\r\nfrequently denied, but still it was extensively believed, especially in\r\nthe Geelong district. After hearing the evidence, the jury were unable\r\nto agree on a verdict of murder in the first degree, as there was a\r\ndoubt as to who struck the blow which killed Corporal Owens. The Judge\r\nruled, however, that if, in an attempt to escape from lawful custody,\r\nany person is killed, all of those attempting to escape are guilty of\r\nmurder. In consequence of this ruling Melville was found guilty and was\r\nsentenced to death. The other prisoners were acquitted. The sentence\r\nwas afterwards commuted to imprisonment for life, and when Melville was\r\ninformed of the \"mercy\" which had been extended to him, he remarked\r\nquietly, \"Well, you'll be sorry for it.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 1857, Mr. John Price, Inspector General of Convicts in\r\nthe Colony of Victoria, attended at the quarry near Williamstown to\r\nhear any petitions or complaints which the convicts might have to\r\npresent. Convict James Kelly was the first called and he asked for a\r\nticket-of-leave. Mr. Price replied that he was unable to accede to\r\nthis request. As he walked away Kelly was heard by Captain Blatchford\r\nto mutter \"Bloody tyrant, your race is nearly run.\" He appeared to\r\nbe in a furious passion, but very little notice was taken of him at\r\nthe time. Several of the prisoners pressed forward and began to crowd\r\nround Mr. Price, loudly complaining that they had not received the due\r\namount of rations. Some exclaimed that they were being cheated. Mr.\r\nPrice stepped back and said in a loud voice, so as to be heard above\r\nthe din, that these complaints must be given in proper form, when full\r\nenquiries should be made. If the charges were true the abuses should\r\nbe rectified, but if they were false or unfounded, those making them\r\nwould be punished. Suddenly a rush was made. Kelly threw a heavy stone,\r\nshouting at the time, \"Down with the bloody tyrant.\" The stone struck\r\nMr. Price and he reeled. The convicts pressed forward shouting \"Give\r\nit him, give it him,\" and a volley of stones was sent flying through\r\nthe air. Captain Blatchford was struck several times and rushed off to\r\nsummon the guard, which was stationed on the other side of the quarry\r\ntramway, behind a large heap of stones. A convict named Bryant was\r\nsaid to have struck Price with a heavy navvy's shovel. He then shouted\r\n\"Come on. He's cooked. He wants no more.\" When Captain Blatchford\r\nreturned with the guard the convicts had placed Price's body on a hand\r\nbarrow, which they held up in their hands. The remainder stood round\r\nas if waiting for orders. The face of the murdered man was calm, even\r\npleasant to look at, but the back of his head was terribly battered,\r\nand the heap of stones was covered with his blood and brains. The\r\nguards surrounded the convicts, who offered no resistance, and they\r\nwere marched away to the wharf and taken on board the _Success_. Soon\r\nafterwards shouts of \"The bloody tyrant's done for, hooray,\" and much\r\ncheering were heard on board of this vessel and on the _Lysander_.\r\nFearing that a general mutiny of convicts might take place, the\r\nharbour defence vessel _Victoria_, with her guns shotted and the crew\r\nat their quarters, was laid alongside the _Success_ ready to sink her\r\nif necessary. The convicts, however, were very quiet and allowed\r\nthemselves to be conducted to their cells without opposition. Fifteen\r\nconvicts were placed on trial for this murder, but each one exercised\r\nhis full right of challenge, so that the panel was exhausted without\r\na jury being secured. On the next day the Crown Prosecutor withdrew\r\nthree prisoners and the jurors to whom they had objected were recalled.\r\nThis manoeuvre was repeated until at length a jury was obtained to try\r\nthree prisoners, Thomas Malony, Thomas Williams, and Henry Smith. They\r\nwere found guilty and sentenced to death. On the day following Richard\r\nJones, William Jones, John Williams, and James Kelly were placed at\r\nthe bar, and after a lengthy consultation the jury returned a verdict\r\nof \"Not guilty.\" This verdict was condemned in the strongest terms by\r\nthe judge, the press, and the general public. The acquittal of Kelly,\r\nwho was said to have led the assault and struck the first blow, caused\r\ngeneral indignation. The remainder of the prisoners were charged in\r\ntwo batches, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to death.\r\nTheir names were Francis Brannagan, Richard Bryant, William Brown, John\r\nYoung, alias Lowe, James Anderson, Henry Smith, alias Brennan, Daniel\r\nDonovan, and John Chesley. The majority of them had been condemned to\r\npenal servitude for bushranging and robbery, and the last on the list\r\nwas Chesley, who was executed on April 30th, 1857.\r\n\r\nMelville had been removed from the hulks to the Melbourne gaol a\r\nshort time before because it was believed that he had been planning\r\na general mutiny, and now it was said that the murder of Mr. Price\r\nhad been included in his scheme. During the first two or three months\r\nof his residence at \"Wintle's Hotel,\" as the Melbourne gaol was\r\nfacetiously called, Melville behaved very quietly, and was treated\r\nas an ordinary prisoner. On July 28th, 1857, he made a savage attack\r\non Mr. Wintle, the Governor of the gaol, and was afterwards confined\r\nto his cell. Later it was reported that for weeks he would behave in\r\nthe most exemplary manner, but would suddenly and unexpectedly break\r\nout into a paroxysm of fury, during which he would destroy everything\r\ndestructible. At these times the warders and officers were ordered\r\nto keep away from his cell, and leave him to himself. He was placed\r\nunder medical surveillance, with a view to ascertain whether he was\r\nsane or not, great care being taken, it was said, not to excite him.\r\nOn August 10th he was locked up as usual, and appeared to be in his\r\nnormal condition as regards health and spirits, but, on his cell\r\nbeing opened next morning, he was found lying dead on the ground. A\r\nblue handkerchief with red spots, which he had brought with him from\r\nthe hulks, was tied round his neck with a slip knot and twisted up\r\ntightly. Dr. McCrae was called in immediately, and said that death was\r\ndue to strangulation. Life had been extinct some three or four hours.\r\nHe was of the opinion that the prisoner had tied the knot himself. A\r\nverdict of _felo de se_ was returned by the coroner's jury which heard\r\nthe case. A variety of opinions were expressed as to this verdict. So\r\nfar as is known, there is no evidence to prove that Melville came to\r\nhis death in any other way than that stated at the inquest, but there\r\nwere numbers of people who asserted their belief that the bushranger\r\nwas strangled by the gaolers. As a rule these people did not blame\r\nthe gaolers for this act. The opinion generally expressed was that\r\nMelville was little better than a wild beast, and was better dead than\r\nalive. They also asserted that it would have been more satisfactory\r\nif the bushranger had been hung openly instead of being murdered\r\nsecretly, and they blamed the Governor and the Judge for having been\r\nso \"soft-hearted\" as to commute his sentence when he was condemned to\r\nthe gallows. There appears, however, to be no evidence in support of\r\nthis view. The records of the inquest are brief, but they seem clearly\r\nenough to prove that the most noted bushranger of the gold-digging\r\nera took his own life in one of the paroxysms to which he was liable.\r\nWhether these paroxysms were due to his harsh treatment on the hulks\r\nis another matter, but we are not in the \"Fifties\" now. The hulks have\r\nbeen destroyed or sold, and the prisoners are treated as humanely now\r\nin Australia as they are in any other civilised country. The treatment\r\nof the bushrangers all through the later developments of that crime\r\ntend to prove that the Australians considered bushranging as a sort of\r\nexotic introduced into the country with the convicts sent from England,\r\nand only to be wiped out by the suppression of the convict element\r\nin the population. We see the influence of this view in New South\r\nWales, Van Diemen's Land, and elsewhere, as well as in Victoria. In\r\nthis colony the appointment of Mr. John Price as Inspector General of\r\nconvicts was an expression of the popular belief. Mr. Price had had a\r\nlong experience among convicts, and the very fact that his treatment\r\nof them was harsh was a recommendation in his favour. He had been\r\nsuperintendent of the convict station of Port Arthur, where he was\r\nknown to the convicts placed under his charge as \"Bloody Tyrant Price.\"\r\nWhen that establishment, of the character of which the late Marcus\r\nClarke gives us an idea, but an idea only, in his story, \"For the Term\r\nof his Natural Life,\" was broken up, in consequence of the cessation of\r\ntransportations to Van Diemen's Land, in 1853, Mr. Price was specially\r\nchosen for the position he held in Victoria because of his knowledge,\r\nnot merely of convict character, but of the personal appearance of a\r\nlarge number of the criminals who were disturbing the peace of the\r\ncolony, because the majority of them had already been under his charge\r\nin Van Diemen's Land. The Victorians desired above all things to keep\r\nthe convicts out of their colony, and as a means to this end they\r\nendeavoured to make their prisons a \"holy terror\" to this class of\r\nimmigrant. When that object had been achieved, or the convict element\r\nin the population had died out by the effluxion of time, they modified\r\ntheir prison discipline in accordance with the growth of humanitarian\r\nideas. Whether they have done all that is possible in this direction\r\nmay be doubted, but this is not the place to discuss this question.\r\nThe evidence so far as it has been collected and considered tends to\r\nshow that the chief remedy for crime is education. It is impossible to\r\nbelieve that even the worst of the bushrangers would have grown up to\r\nbe such scourges to society had they been properly cared for during\r\nthe impressionable period of their lives, and many of them amid all\r\ntheir savagery show traces of qualities which might, under happier\r\ncircumstances, have fitted them for useful positions in the world. It\r\nmay be added here that Mr. John Price is popularly supposed to have\r\nbeen the prototype of \"Maurice Freere\" in Marcus Clarke's novel, which\r\nshould be read by every student of Australian history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  Murder of a Bullock-driver; Sticking Up in the Melbourne Streets;\r\n  Stealing £100,000 in Bank Notes; Want of Efficient Police Protection;\r\n  Murders and Robberies at Ballarat, Bendigo, Mount Alexander, and\r\n  other Diggings; The Robbery of the McIvor Gold Escort; A Bushranger\r\n  Intimidated by a Bottle of Brandy; Robbery of the Bank of Victoria at\r\n  Ballarat; Capture of Garrett in London; Prevalence of Horse-stealing;\r\n  The Doctor's Creamy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Captain Melville, although it removed the central figure\r\nin this the third bushranging epoch in Australia, by no means put a\r\nstop to the crime. Melville had been a specialist, a true highwayman,\r\nwhile the others were merely general practitioners who were not very\r\nparticular what crimes they committed so long as they secured booty. On\r\nJanuary 24th, 1853, the driver of the mail coach from Colac to Geelong\r\nwas ordered to bail up near Mr. Dennie's station. The driver kept on.\r\nOne of the bushrangers reached out to grasp the reins, while the other\r\nfired at the driver. The report frightened the horse of the man who\r\nwas trying to seize the reins, and it bolted, throwing the rider. The\r\nmail-man whipped his horses into a gallop and got safely away.\r\n\r\nRichard Bryant and William Mack walked into Mr. J. Jackson's store at\r\nFryer's Creek, Mount Alexander, and ordered the storeman to bail up.\r\nThey took all the money that was in the till, a quantity of gold dust,\r\nand a bundle of the most valuable articles they could find. They were\r\narrested by Constable Bloomfield in a house in Melbourne and sentenced\r\nto twelve years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nOn May 7th, a carrier named William Morgan left Melbourne with several\r\npassengers, each of whom had agreed to pay him £14 to carry his \"swag\"\r\nto the Mount Alexander diggings. Besides these swags Morgan had some\r\ngoods for the conveyance of which to the diggings he was to receive\r\n£29. The first day's journey was a short one, the party camping near\r\nthe Lady of the Lake Inn. The passengers, who, it may be as well to\r\nexplain, had to walk, had a tent with them which they took off the\r\ndray. They were erecting this when Morgan and the driver of another\r\ndray camped there, named Pilcock, walked to a blacksmith's shop near\r\nthe hotel to get some small jobs done. Pilcock returned alone and\r\ninformed the company that Morgan had walked on to \"Tulip\" Wright's to\r\ntry and purchase an extra pair of bullocks to strengthen his team. The\r\nfollowing morning Pilcock yoked up Morgan's team as well as his own,\r\nand asked one of the passengers to drive it, adding that Morgan would\r\njoin them somewhere along the road. They were about to start when a\r\nlittle boy, travelling with his parents by another dray, ran up crying\r\nout that there was \"a man's head sticking out of the ground.\" A rush\r\nto the place was made and the child's statement proved to be true. The\r\nbody was dug up and identified as Morgan's. From the appearance of the\r\nground about half-way between the camp and the blacksmith's shop it\r\nwas apparent that a fierce struggle had taken place. The ground was\r\ntrampled and torn up as if with a wrestling match. A pool of blood was\r\ndiscovered with a track leading from it to where the body was found,\r\nshowing that it had been dragged there. Some wonder was expressed that\r\nso severe a contest should have taken place without any sound having\r\nbeen heard at the camp, which was not more than a quarter of a mile\r\naway. But there were some fifty or sixty people at the camp, and some\r\nof these had been amusing themselves by singing, while others had been\r\nplaying concertinas and other musical instruments. The noise thus\r\nmade had no doubt drowned the noise of the deadly contest which was\r\ntaking place so close at hand. Pilcock was arrested at once, and was\r\nsubsequently convicted and hung. Had his project succeeded, he would\r\nhave made quite a nice little haul with the money for the loading on\r\nthe two drays.\r\n\r\nSo prevalent was crime at this time, that even the streets of Melbourne\r\nwere not safe. One afternoon, David Clegg and Henry Jones were driving\r\nhome in a spring cart from Melbourne, to the huge encampment on Emerald\r\nHill, known as Canvas Town. They had just crossed Prince's Bridge,\r\nover the Yarra Yarra, when they were ordered to bail up. Clegg caught\r\nup a double-barrelled gun from the bottom of the cart, but before he\r\ncould make any use of it, it was snatched from his hands by one of the\r\nrobbers, who cried out: \"Stand aside till I blow his---- brains out.\"\r\nA second robber said: \"Oh, let him go.\" While these two were disputing\r\nas to whether Clegg should be shot or not, a third robber struck the\r\nhorse and started him off. During the next few days the Canvas Town\r\nmob, as it was called, committed several robberies in the neighbourhood\r\nof Prince's Bridge, and at length the police made an effort to protect\r\ntravellers between Melbourne and Canvas Town (now known as South\r\nMelbourne). One day, Chief Constable Bloomfield and Mr. Farrell were\r\nwalking together near the bridge, when Bloomfield exclaimed: \"Hulloa!\r\nthere's a man I want for uttering a £5 note.\" He crossed the street\r\nand said: \"Well Hammond.\" \"What the---- do you want?\" asked Hammond.\r\n\"Oh, you needn't be afraid, I won't hurt you,\" replied Bloomfield. \"I\r\ndon't care whether you do or not,\" cried Hammond, walking beside the\r\npoliceman in bravado. Bloomfield delayed making the arrest in hopes\r\nthat another constable would appear, until Hammond turned away, when he\r\ngrabbed him. Farrell shouted, \"Look out, Bloomfield,\" and the constable\r\nturned, but not quickly enough to avoid a blow aimed at him by another\r\nman. Bloomfield fell, but did not relax his grip on Hammond, and two\r\nother constables appearing at the time, both Hammond and Edwards were\r\nsecured. James Hammond and William Edwards were identified as the men\r\nwho wished to shoot Clegg, and were sent to gaol for ten years, the\r\nfirst three in irons. Another man, named Smith, who had prevented\r\nHammond from firing at Clegg, was let off with six years.\r\n\r\nAnother batch of this gang of scoundrels which infested the river\r\nside at Melbourne was secured in connection with the stealing of a\r\nconsignment of bank notes with the face value of £100,000. These notes\r\nwere brought to Melbourne in the ship _Strathedon_, consigned to\r\nMessrs. Willis, Merry & Co. as agents for the Union Bank of Australia.\r\nThe notes were for £15, £10, £5 and £1. They were unsigned and were\r\ntherefore non-negotiable. They appear to have been taken from the ship\r\nand dumped down on the wharf, pending the arrival of a dray to take\r\nthe case to the warehouse of Messrs. Willis, Merry & Co. When the dray\r\narrived, however, the box could not be found. The loss caused great\r\nexcitement and the police were notified of the robbery. Some days\r\nlater an unsigned £10 note was passed on Messrs. Brasch & Sommerfeld,\r\nCollins Street, in exchange for clothing, and this led to the arrest\r\nof William Young. During the following week William Layworth, William\r\nSimpson, William Rogers, and Thomas Stroud were detected in attempts\r\nto pass unsigned notes on various hotel and boarding-house keepers,\r\nstore-keepers, and others, and were arrested. Stroud's residence was\r\nsearched and a number of the unsigned notes were found there. His wife\r\nwas arrested, but was acquitted. Layworth turned Queen's evidence\r\nand escaped punishment, but Young, Simpson, Rogers, and Stroud were\r\nsentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The jury commented on the\r\ncarelessness shown by the bank and its agents in leaving the box\r\nunwatched on the wharf. The manager of the bank expressed his regrets\r\nand promised that more care should be taken in future.\r\n\r\nJohn Atkins went into the Cross Keys Hotel in Melbourne and called for\r\na drink. George Ellison, who was in the bar, asked him what he had done\r\nwith the gold he had brought from the diggings. Atkins replied that\r\nhe had none. Ellison called him a liar, and said that if he had not\r\ncome from the diggings his trousers would not be the colour they were.\r\nEverybody knew a digger, because his moleskin trousers were always\r\ncoloured by the clay he worked in. A row started, and the landlord\r\ninterfered and told Atkins to leave. He did so, but was followed by\r\nEllison and another man, who knocked him down and robbed him of his\r\ngold. Ellison was arrested next day and was sent to gaol.\r\n\r\nThe _Geelong Advertiser_ of March 5th says:--\"The shameful want of\r\nadequate protection along the main roads leading to the diggings has\r\nrepeatedly been exemplified in the robberies, assaults, and murders\r\ncommitted by bushrangers upon a number of luckless wayfarers, with the\r\ngrossest and most notorious impunity. These unavenged offences against\r\nsociety and the public peace have been excused by some, on account of\r\nthe difficulty of keeping afoot such an extended line of patrol as\r\nwould effectually intimidate marauders.... When we are in possession\r\nof the fact that the Sydney Executive could and did accomplish such\r\nprotective arrangements over a hundred and fifty miles of country,\r\nwe may be allowed to doubt the alleged inability of the Victorian\r\nGovernment to render equally efficient aid out of a revenue probably\r\nten times as great as that derived by the sister colony from the same\r\nsource; at least we might reasonably suppose that townships between\r\nMelbourne and Mount Alexander, Geelong and Ballarat, would be supplied\r\nwith police, mounted or otherwise, to act in a radius of ten miles or\r\nso when called upon.... A gentleman well known to the public, from\r\nhis long connection with the newspaper press, has been the victim of\r\na murderous assault. His story is that while at Ballan, a township\r\nabout twenty miles this side of Ballarat, on the Melbourne road, a\r\nman attacked him with an iron poker. The gentleman raised his arm to\r\nprotect his head and it was broken. But for this the blow might have\r\nfallen on his head and proved fatal.... Two days were wasted at Ballan\r\nand four at Bacchus Marsh waiting to find a magistrate to issue a writ\r\nfor the arrest of his assailant.... The gentleman having been robbed of\r\nhis money had to make his way to town for medical aid by the charity of\r\npersons along the road. Fortunately some kind friends supplied him with\r\nmeans to obtain food and carriage.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time the police were too busy harrying the diggers for the\r\nexorbitant licence to attend to the roads, but later in the year,\r\nwhen the Melbourne papers backed up the demand for better police\r\nprotection, police stations were established at the larger camping\r\nplaces where villages or, as they are called in Australia, townships\r\nhad grown up. In the meantime numbers of murders were committed without\r\nthe perpetrators of the crimes being discovered. Thus Mr. and Mrs.\r\nSkinner were travelling from Bendigo to the new rush at McIvor and\r\ncamped for the night on the banks of Eve Creek. In the morning Skinner\r\nwent to look for his horse while his wife prepared breakfast. When\r\nshe went to the lagoon to fill the billy to make the tea, she saw the\r\nhalf-immersed body of a man. When her husband returned he drew the body\r\nout of the water, and saw that the head had been fearfully battered.\r\nA pocket-knife, pipe, tobacco, and a silk handkerchief were found in\r\nthe pockets, but no gold or money. An enquiry was held in this case,\r\nand a verdict of murder was pronounced against some person or persons\r\nunknown, and that was all; but there were hundreds of such cases in\r\nwhich no enquiry was held.\r\n\r\nJohn Shannon was travelling from Ballarat to Geelong, and stopped for\r\nthe night at an inn at Batesford. He called on Mr. White, a butcher,\r\nand had tea and was about to return to his inn, when three men stopped\r\nhim at the door. One of these men asked, \"Is this the butcher's shop?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Shannon. \"Ah! you're just the bloke we want,\" exclaimed\r\nthe man. The three men then hustled Shannon back into the shop and\r\ncompelled him to stand with his back to the wall and his arms stretched\r\nout. White was placed in a similar position, and made to stand while\r\nthe robbers emptied the till. They then searched Shannon's pockets,\r\nand took out a parcel of gold and some money. He objected, and one of\r\nthe men who had been standing on guard at the door drew a pistol, put\r\nthe muzzle close to Shannon's breast, and pulled the trigger. Shannon\r\nfell. The man who had been searching him turned the body over, and then\r\nsaid, \"Barry, it's finished; we'll be off.\" The three men then left, no\r\nattempt being made to detain them. An inquest was held on the body, and\r\na verdict of wilful murder was returned against three men whose names\r\nwere unknown. The jury added: \"We cannot separate without expressing a\r\nstrong feeling with regard to the unprotected state of the road between\r\nGeelong and Ballarat, which is overrun with bad characters. We would\r\nrespectfully but firmly urge on the Executive the immediate necessity\r\nof erecting intermediate police stations between the two places, with\r\npatrols to traverse the road from station to station, and we would also\r\npoint out the necessity for strenuously enforcing the Vagrant Act.\"\r\nThree men were arrested and charged with this cold-blooded murder, but\r\nwere acquitted.\r\n\r\nThe great bushranging event of the year was the sticking up and\r\nrobbing of the Gold Escort from the McIvor Goldfield. The escort was\r\na private one travelling from McIvor to Kyneton, where it met the\r\nGovernment Escort which conveyed gold from Bendigo and Mount Alexander\r\nto Melbourne. It started, as usual, on July 28th. At about fifteen\r\nmiles from McIvor and three miles from the Mia-Mia Hotel, there was a\r\nsharp bend in the road round a point of rocks which jutted out from\r\nthe range. At the bend a mia-mia, or shelter such as is made of boughs\r\nby the blacks, had been constructed, and opposite to it a big log was\r\ndrawn across the track. This compelled the driver of the escort cart to\r\npull his horses off the track and drive very close past the mia-mia.\r\nThe road was very rough, and the cart swayed about badly. Just as it\r\nwas passing the mia-mia a volley was fired from it, and the three\r\ntroopers on the cart as well as the driver fell. The horses on which\r\nMr. Warner, in charge of the escort, and Sergeant Duins were mounted\r\nwere both wounded. Although they were wounded, the troopers returned\r\nthe fire as speedily as possible, but could see nothing to shoot at\r\nexcept the bushes. The bushrangers fired again, and the troopers were\r\ncompelled to fall back, when about a dozen men rushed from behind the\r\nmia-mia, seized the two boxes which contained the gold, and rushed back\r\ninto the scrub. Mr. Warner sent Sergeant Duins to the nearest police\r\ncamp for assistance, and then followed the bushrangers, who fired at\r\nhim. He replied with the three shots remaining in his revolver, and\r\nthen retired. Then Mr. Warner galloped as fast as his wounded horse\r\ncould go to Patterson's station for help. On his return with some of\r\nthe station hands he found a man putting the wounded troopers into the\r\ncart, and arrested him on suspicion of being one of the robbers. The\r\ndriver, T. Flooks, was the most seriously hurt, and he died a few days\r\nlater. He and the troopers, S.B. Davis, J. Morton, and R. Boeswetter,\r\nwere taken to the hospital at the police camp on the McIvor goldfield\r\nas quickly as possible, and the man who had been arrested, having\r\nproved that he had no connection with the bushrangers, but had been\r\nacting from purely humanitarian motives, was discharged. A party was\r\norganised to pursue the robbers, and on going to the place where the\r\nattack had been made three horses with packsaddles were found tied\r\nto the trees. It was conjectured that the robbers had been disturbed\r\nbefore they could pack the gold on the horses by the approach of the\r\npursuing party, and had made off on foot into the ranges. Some time\r\npassed away, and then a man named John Murphy was arrested on board the\r\nship _Madagascar_, lying in Hobson's Bay. He had taken a passage in her\r\non the eve of her departure for England. When charged he admitted that\r\nhe had been one of the party, and promised to turn approver. He gave\r\nsome information, which led to the arrest of others of the gang, but he\r\nthen seems to have repented of his decision, as he committed suicide.\r\nHis brother, Jeremiah Murphy, however, was arrested in Queensland, and\r\ngave the desired information, thereby escaping punishment. The gold\r\nstolen was valued at about £5000, and very little of it was recovered.\r\nGeorge Wilson, George Melville, and William Atkins were charged with\r\nthe murder of Thomas Flooks, and were found guilty. They were hung in\r\nMelbourne, on October 4th. Atkins died as soon as the bolt was drawn,\r\nbut Wilson and Melville struggled for several minutes. The hangman was\r\ncompelled to \"draw the legs of Melville down with considerable force\"\r\nbefore life was extinct.\r\n\r\nAlfred Stallard and Christopher Goodison went to a tent at Bendigo\r\nCreek, and entered into conversation with Mrs. Roberts, who lived\r\nthere. They offered her a glass of rum which she drank. It is supposed\r\nthat the liquor was drugged, as she became insensible, and the two\r\nmen \"made a pack\" of everything valuable in the tent, including five\r\nounces of gold, and walked away. On his return to his tent, William\r\nRoberts was informed of what had taken place and gave information to\r\nthe police. The robbers were followed and were captured near the Loddon\r\nRiver. When they were asked at their trial whether they had anything to\r\nurge as a reason for mitigating their punishment, Goodison complained\r\nthat they had been chained to a tree for three days at the Loddon. They\r\nwere forced to walk to Mount Alexander, and were then chained to a log\r\nin the Camp Reserve for ten days. They were marched to Kyneton, where\r\nthey were kept in the lock-up for five days on bread and water. From\r\nthence they were conveyed to Melbourne by coach. They received little\r\nsympathy, however, because it was well known that diggers whose only\r\ncrime was inability to pay a heavy licence fee were treated no better.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the tragic events of the year were lightened by a touch\r\nof comedy, as when a resident of Ashby was returning home from his\r\nbusiness place in Geelong. It was dark when he was crossing the\r\ndam, when a man presented a pistol at him and called \"Bail up.\" The\r\nsuburbanite was taking home with him a bottle of brandy, which, in\r\naccordance with the custom of that time, was not wrapped in paper.\r\nPaper was too dear in Australia to be used for wrapping articles\r\nwhich would keep together without. When challenged, the suburbanite\r\nbrought the bottle from under his coat, presented it at the head of\r\nthe bushranger, and cried, \"You bail up.\" The would-be robber, taken\r\nby surprise, dropped his pistol and turned to run, but the suburbanite\r\ncried \"Stop, or I'll fire,\" and the fellow stopped. The suburbanite\r\nthought for a moment whether he should take the \"bushranger\" to the\r\nlock-up or not, and decided that it would only entail a \"lot of\r\ntrouble,\" so he punched his head and let him go. He kept the pistol\r\nas a trophy, and carried home his bottle intact. About the same time\r\nEdmund Taylor was found in the bush dead. His body was terribly\r\nmutilated. He had left Eureka, Ballarat, to travel to Burnt Bridge, and\r\nwas known to have taken with him a bank receipt for £200 and a £10 note.\r\n\r\nArthur Burrow and William Garroway called at the hut of William Henry\r\nMitchell, at Pennyweight Flat, Ballarat, and asked the way to the\r\ntownship. Mitchell told them and was then asked to \"shout.\" Mitchell\r\nrefused, when Garroway struck him with a pick handle, while Burrow drew\r\nout a pistol and presented it. They took what gold they could find and\r\nwalked on. They were joined by two other men, and stuck up and robbed\r\nAlexander McLean. They were followed and arrested.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bryan and John Douglass were also convicted of highway robbery\r\nat Muddy Creek and other places between Geelong and Ballarat, and sent\r\nto gaol for five years. James Nugent and four others stopped Benjamin\r\nNapton on the road near Modewarre. They pretended they were policemen\r\nin search of bushrangers. Nugent was anxious to take care of Napton's\r\ngold for him, but Napton refused to entrust it to him. They walked\r\ntogether to Kildare, where they went into the Sportsman's Arms and had\r\ndrinks. When they came out, Napton missed his gold, and Nugent was\r\narrested. A knife was found on him, and this had some soil sticking\r\nto it. At the police-court investigation the magistrate recommended\r\nthe police to dig in the yard of the hotel near where Nugent had been\r\nstanding. They did so, and found a bag containing 9 oz. of gold. Two\r\nnuggets, which Napton said were also in it, could not be found.\r\n\r\nRoberts, who had been convicted of complicity in the robbery of gold\r\nfrom the ship _Nelson_, but who had been pardoned on a question of\r\nidentity having been subsequently raised, was captured, and charged\r\nat Buninyong with highway robbery. He, with ten other men, was\r\nbeing conveyed to Geelong to serve the ten years to which he had\r\nbeen sentenced, and were halted at Ray's Hotel, on the road, for\r\nrefreshments. Roberts begged to be allowed to write a letter to a\r\nmagistrate in the neighbourhood, and his request being granted, his\r\nright hand was freed from the handcuffs. The other prisoner to whom\r\nhe was chained managed to slip his hand out of the handcuff, and\r\nRoberts being thus free, jumped through the window and bolted for the\r\nbush. Only one constable had been left in the room in charge of the\r\nprisoners, and he could only shout out an alarm. However, Roberts ran\r\nalmost into the arms of the foot policeman, who had recently been\r\nstationed at this point, and he held the bushranger until the other\r\nconstables came up.\r\n\r\nOn December 14th, 1854, Thomas Quinn, a stonemason, started from his\r\nhome in Geelong and rode to Ballarat. He left his pony at Mrs. Smith's,\r\nabout three miles from the diggings, and walked in. He stopped at the\r\ntent of John Boulton, and played cards with Boulton and his mate,\r\nHenry Marriott. Later on the three men went to the tent owned by Henry\r\nBeresford Garrett at the Big Gravel Pits. They took their revolvers,\r\nbut no powder and shot, and walked across Main Street to the Bank\r\nof Victoria on Bakery Hill. They had formulated a plan to rob the\r\nbank, and Quinn had been induced to join on the understanding that\r\nno violence was to be used. Hence the unloaded pistols. They put new\r\ncaps on to the revolvers and some paper in the muzzles to \"make them\r\nlook as if they were loaded.\" Garrett and Boulton entered the bank,\r\nMarriott stopped at the door inside, while Quinn remained outside on\r\nwatch in the street. They ordered the cashier and teller, Messrs.\r\nBuckley and Marshall, to \"bail up.\" Then they tied the hands of the\r\ntwo bank officials, and collected the spoil. As soon as they were\r\noutside they separated, one going down Bakery Hill, another along the\r\nMelbourne Road, and the others by different routes across the Eureka\r\nPlateau, having previously agreed to meet at Garrett's tent. They\r\nhad taken with them notes, sovereigns, and silver to the amount of\r\n£14,300, besides about 350 ounces of gold. When they had divided the\r\nloot Marriott returned to his lodgings in \"the township,\" now known as\r\nthe City of Ballarat. He lodged at a boarding-house in Lydiard Street.\r\nGarrett disposed of his tent and tools, and went by coach to Melbourne,\r\nfrom whence he shipped direct for London. Quinn and Boulton went to\r\nGeelong. They stayed one night at Quinn's house in Chilwell, and went\r\nby boat next day to Melbourne, where they sold their share of the gold\r\nat the London Chartered Bank in Collins Street. They returned next day\r\nto Geelong, and again stopped at Quinn's house for a night, and then\r\nwent back to Boulton's tent on the diggings. They took good care not\r\nto mention the robbery before Mrs. Boulton, because \"she was a good\r\nwoman.\" On the following day Boulton went to the bank from which the\r\nmoney had been stolen and asked for a draft on London for £1450. With\r\nan infatuation difficult to account for he tendered in payment for\r\nthis draft some of the stolen bank notes, among those which he had\r\nreceived for the gold in Melbourne. This was almost like asking plainly\r\nto be arrested. Of course the notes were recognised at once. He was\r\nkept waiting on some frivolous pretext while the police were sent for,\r\nand was then arrested. One of the stolen £10 notes was produced at\r\nthe trial and identified as part of the money advanced by Boulton in\r\npayment of the draft. Quinn and Marriott were speedily arrested, and\r\nQuinn turned approver. The other two were sentenced to ten years' penal\r\nservitude. Detective Webb followed Garrett to London and found him in\r\nfashionable lodgings near Oxford Street. The detective watched him for\r\nsome days before he made up his mind that the fashionably-dressed man\r\nwas the bank robber he was after. One day he saw Garrett come out of\r\nhis lodgings and followed him into Oxford Street. Suddenly Webb shouted\r\n\"Garrett,\" and Garrett, taken by surprise, stopped and half-turned\r\nround. That was enough to convince the detective that he was right. He\r\nwalked up to the robber, slapped him on the shoulder, and said \"How do\r\nyou do, Mr. Garrett?\" \"I don't know you,\" replied Garrett. \"Perhaps\r\nnot,\" returned the detective, \"but I know you. You've just arrived\r\nfrom Melbourne in the _Dawstone_. I've a warrant here to arrest you\r\nfor robbing the Bank of Victoria at Ballarat. Will you come quietly?\"\r\nGarrett saw that the game was up and surrendered. He reached Melbourne\r\nin August, 1855, and was speedily sentenced to keep his former mates\r\ncompany for ten years.\r\n\r\nSufficient has, I think, been said to indicate the state of the\r\ncountry and the character of the crimes committed during this epoch.\r\nHow many men were shot while prowling about the tents on Ballarat,\r\nBendigo, Mount Alexander, and other diggings it is impossible to say.\r\nMany of the bushrangers, after having made a haul on the roads or on\r\nthe diggings, went to Melbourne or Geelong and spent their ill-gotten\r\ngains in riot and debauchery, and then committed crimes in these towns\r\nfor which they were captured and punished. Others returned to New\r\nSouth Wales or to Van Diemen's Land and ended their careers there.\r\nIt was rarely known how many crimes even those who were captured had\r\ncommitted. They were placed on trial for their last offence. In some\r\ncases it was said that the prisoner had been guilty of other crimes,\r\nbut the difficulty of finding witnesses in a population which was\r\ncontinuously shifting from one end of the country to the other, as new\r\ngoldfields were opened, made it impossible to prosecute for crimes\r\ncommitted a few months before. It was the custom therefore to inflict\r\nlong terms of imprisonment to keep the evil-disposed out of mischief\r\nfor a time. When a prisoner was tried and convicted for more than one\r\ncrime the sentences were usually made concurrent, so that there was no\r\nencouragement for the police to pile up a record of crimes against a\r\nprisoner. Captain Melville was the one exception to this rule.\r\n\r\nThe sole motive for the robberies of this epoch was a sordid lust\r\nfor gold, which seems to have seized many men who but for the gold\r\ndiscoveries might have lived out honourable lives. The case of George\r\nHanslip may be cited as an instance of this. He was a confidential\r\nclerk employed by Mr. Spence, draper, of Collins Street, Melbourne.\r\nHe was sent by his employer to pay some accounts and purchase goods\r\nin Sydney, at that time the emporium of Australia. For convenience of\r\ncarriage, in days when communication was difficult and bank drafts\r\nrare, he was entrusted with 1400 ounces of gold and some jewellery,\r\nand was instructed to offer the gold to Messrs. C. Newton & Co., of\r\nPitt Street, on his arrival at Sydney. He reached Sydney by boat at\r\nnine a.m., but did not call at Messrs. Newton's store until three\r\np.m., when he reported that he had been robbed of the gold. He seemed\r\nvery excited, saying to Mr. Newton \"Oh, what shall I do?\" He asked\r\nMr. Newton to go with him to Malcolm's Adelphi Hotel, and Mr. McKeon,\r\none of the partners in the firm, did so, and saw a carpet bag which\r\nhad been ripped open. Hanslip said he felt certain that the gold had\r\nbeen taken to Hobart Town, and asked Mr. Newton for the loan of £50\r\nto enable him to go there to seek for it, but whether Hanslip overdid\r\nhis part or not, Mr. Newton began to be suspicious of him, and refused\r\nto lend the money. One thing that tended to make him doubt that the\r\nmoney had been stolen as Hanslip said, was that Hanslip was spending\r\nmoney very freely. Enquiries were made, and it transpired that Hanslip\r\nhad called on a Mr. Marks and offered to sell him the gold before he\r\ncalled on Mr. Newton. Marks had agreed, and sent a man with Hanslip to\r\nthe Adelphi to fetch the gold, so that it might be weighed. On their\r\narrival Hanslip had fumbled about with his key for several minutes\r\nand could not open the door of his room. He said he believed the\r\ndoor must have been nailed up. He got it open at last, and when they\r\nwent in the first thing they saw was the ripped bag and a few grains\r\nof gold scattered about on the hearthrug. Another carpet bag had been\r\nturned out, and the clothes scattered about the room. It was after this\r\nthat Hanslip went to Mr. Newton's, who advised him to give notice to\r\nMr. McLerie, the Police Superintendent. Hanslip went to Mr. McLerie's\r\noffice, and afterwards had a handbill printed offering £1000 reward for\r\nthe recovery of the gold. Information was to be addressed to \"George\r\nHanslip, Esq.\" The result of the police enquiries was that Hanslip\r\nwas himself arrested and charged with having stolen the gold. On\r\nenquiries being made, it was discovered that he had left the jewellery\r\nentrusted to him at his lodgings in Melbourne. He was convicted, but\r\nin consequence of his previous good character he was let off with a\r\ncomparatively light sentence.\r\n\r\nBut for the unfortunate dispute between the Government and the diggers\r\nover the licence fee, it is probable that the bushrangers might have\r\nbeen disposed of in less time than they were. That dispute culminated\r\nat the end of 1854, in a fight between the more violent section of the\r\ndiggers and the military. Although the military won in the conflict\r\non the Eureka, the diggers were the actual victors, and during the\r\nyear 1855 they were granted all that the moderate party had previously\r\nasked for. With the settlement of this vexed question the police were\r\nrelieved from their task of harrying the diggers, and devoted their\r\ntime to the suppression of bushranging so successfully, that in the\r\nlatter half of 1855 the Government proposed to make a considerable\r\nreduction in the police force. The _Ballarat Times_, the _Bendigo\r\nAdvertiser_, and the various newspapers in Melbourne and Geelong\r\nprotested strongly against this proposed reduction. The gold digging\r\norgans predicted an immediate increase in bushranging and other\r\nforms of lawlessness, but when the reduction was made in 1856, these\r\npredictions were not fulfilled. No doubt many of the bushrangers were\r\ncaptured and punished as horse-stealers. The two crimes have always\r\nbeen intimately related in Australia. Horses were a necessity to\r\nbushrangers, and a man who would steal a horse would not be likely\r\nto hesitate to stick up an unarmed man if money or gold might be\r\nobtained by that means, and they were quite as liable to be arrested\r\nwhile stealing a horse as when robbing a man. For two or three years\r\nit was almost impossible for any honest man to keep a horse. Perhaps\r\none of the most daring and impudent of this class of offence, was the\r\nstealing of Dr. Bailey's \"Creamy,\" in 1855. Dr. Bailey was perhaps\r\nthe best known man in Geelong. He was elected the first mayor of the\r\ntown when it was incorporated in 1849, and was re-elected for several\r\nconsecutive years. He was very wealthy, rather pompous, and highly\r\nrespected. He had given up general practice, but had an office, where\r\nhe received a few patients and friends, at the rear of Mr. Poulton's\r\nchemist's shop in the Market Square. One morning he rode to his office\r\nas usual, hitched Creamy, which was as well known in Geelong as his\r\nmaster, to a post in Moorabool Street, the busiest portion of the town,\r\nand went into his office. Almost as soon as the doctor disappeared,\r\na man in shirt sleeves unhitched the horse, threw himself carelessly\r\ninto the saddle and rode slowly away. He nodded familiarly to the\r\npoliceman at the corner, who, like the numerous persons about at the\r\ntime, thought the fellow was the doctor's groom sent to take Creamy\r\nback to the stable. The man rode very slowly up Moorabool Street until\r\nhe turned into Ryrie Street, but once out of sight of those who saw\r\nhim mount he must have travelled much faster. He had barely turned the\r\ncorner when the real groom rode up, and he was much surprised to find\r\nthat Creamy was already gone. Of course, the excitement was intense.\r\nThe idea that anybody would dare to steal the doctor's horse had never\r\nentered the head of the most imaginative person in Geelong. Why, even\r\na burglary at Buckingham Palace would not have been more astonishing.\r\nCrowds collected to stare at the hitching post on the kerb opposite\r\nthe doctor's office. Parties of mounted police and civilians started\r\nto hunt for the robber in all directions, but no traces of the missing\r\nCreamy could be discovered, and it was not until some months later\r\nthat he was discovered in Ballarat. The daring scoundrel had ridden\r\nhim straight to the diggings, and had sold him in Mr. O'Farrell's\r\nnewly-opened \"Horse Bazaar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  An Escape from Norfolk Island; Stealing a Government Boat; The\r\n  Convicts of New South Wales; A Terrible Indictment; Thomas Willmore;\r\n  Murder of Philip Alger; Murder of Malachi Daly; Fight between two\r\n  Bushrangers; Hunting down Willmore; His Capture while Asleep; The\r\n  Last of the Van Diemen's Land Bushrangers; Wilson and Dido; Some\r\n  Minor Offenders; An Unfounded Charge; Change of Name to Rid the\r\n  Island of Evil Associations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rush of men of all sorts from all parts of the world to the great\r\ngoldfields of Victoria, although it no doubt attracted the majority\r\nof the desperate characters from the neighbouring colonies, did not\r\nentirely free them from bushrangers. It is necessary, therefore, to\r\ndevote our attention to these, and Norfolk Island claims first place.\r\nOn March 15th, 1853, a few months before the penal settlement on the\r\nisland was finally broken up, a number of convicts were employed\r\nin loading the store ship _Lord Auckland_. The ship lay off in the\r\nroads, and the goods were taken out to her in boats rowed by convicts,\r\nunder the charge of soldiers. One boat, manned by the convicts Dennis\r\nGriffiths, James Clegg, Thomas Clayton, Robert Mitchell, Joseph Davis,\r\nPatrick Cooper, Jeremiah O'Sullivan, John Naisk, and \"Ginger,\" was on\r\nits way to the ship with a load. When it was at about a quarter of a\r\nmile from the shore the convicts suddenly rose up, rushed the soldiers,\r\nand threw them overboard. No other boat was near, and this gave the\r\nconvicts the opportunity they had been looking for. One constable was\r\nleft on board, and Bordmore, the coxswain, seized the gunwale of the\r\nboat and held on. The convicts resumed their oars and pulled as hard\r\nas they could, but as Bordmore refused to let go, and stopped the way\r\nof the boat, he was taken on board again and set to his old work of\r\nsteering. He was, however, ordered on pain of death to steer for the\r\nmain land. On April 11th they reached Stradbroke Island, off Moreton\r\nBay, but in taking the boat through the surf she stranded. The men on\r\nboard, however, all got safely on shore. The constable and coxswain,\r\nwith convict Mitchell, were left near the landing-place while the other\r\neight walked along the coast to seek for food, of which they were much\r\nin need. They found the hut of Ferdinand Gonzales, a fisherman, and\r\ntried to induce him to lend them his boat to take them to the mainland.\r\nThey represented themselves as having been shipwrecked, but Gonzales\r\ndid not believe them, and refused to trust them with his boat. They\r\nwent away, and Gonzales walked to where they had said their boat had\r\nbeen capsized to ascertain whether their story was true or not, and\r\nduring his absence they returned, stripped his hut of all that was\r\neatable or of value, and stole his boat. They pulled round the coast\r\nout of sight, and then sent Clegg and Griffiths to fetch the constable\r\nand the others, but the two officers had in the meantime secured\r\nMitchell, and now arrested Clegg and Griffiths. The other six runaways\r\nwaited for a time, and then started for the mainland. On the Monday\r\nfollowing a fisherman named Thomas Duffy went from the mainland to the\r\nisland, and he consented to land the constable, the coxswain, and their\r\nthree prisoners at Moreton Bay, from whence they marched to Brisbane,\r\nwhere the prisoners were lodged in gaol. In a few days complaints of\r\nrobberies having been committed along the coast were received, and\r\nthe Customs boat, with six armed constables on board, was despatched\r\nto capture the runaways. They were told to call at Cleveland Point to\r\npick up the Chief Constable, who had gone to the coast by land. When\r\nnear the mouth of the Brisbane River, on passing a patch of scrub,\r\nthe constables suddenly became aware that another boat was alongside,\r\nand that they were threatened by six men armed with pistols. This\r\ncompletely turned the tables. The constables were compelled to hold\r\nup their hands, and were towed into the scrub, where they were forced\r\nto land and strip. The convicts took the constables' clothes and gave\r\nthem their own rags in exchange, and then, having made them get into\r\nGonzales' old boat, ordered them to \"be off.\" There was nothing else\r\nto be done, and the would-be captors returned to Brisbane as rapidly\r\nas they could, only to be arrested as the runaways. However, they soon\r\nestablished their identity, and were released. In the meantime the\r\nrunaways, being decently dressed and having a first-class boat, pulled\r\nto the barque _Acacia_, which was lying at the mouth of the river\r\nwaiting for the mails, before beginning her voyage to Sydney. They told\r\ntheir old story about being shipwrecked mariners, and were believed and\r\ninvited on board, where they were hospitably feasted. The constables\r\nwere blamed for not having given notice to the vessels lying at the\r\nmouth of the river, of the fact that these convicts were at large,\r\nbut they had not yet reached that part of the river when they were\r\ncaptured themselves, and if they had gone to these vessels in Gonzales'\r\nbattered boat and in the tattered raiment of the runaways, they would\r\nnot only not have been believed, but might have been detained or sent\r\nto Brisbane as the runaways they resembled. It was a very trying and\r\ndifficult position in which they were placed. When the convicts left\r\nthe _Acacia_ where they had been so well entertained, they pulled to\r\nthe house of Mr. Watson, the chief pilot, and robbed him of provisions,\r\na gold watch and chain, and about £40 in money. They stove in his boat\r\nto prevent him from going to the mainland to report, but left him a\r\nbottle of rum out of his store to \"keep his spirits up a bit.\" Mr.\r\nWatson, however, managed, when they had gone away, to patch up his\r\nboat so as to enable him to cross the narrow strait which separated\r\nPilot Island from the mainland, and very soon several boats, manned by\r\nconstables and volunteers, were searching the scrubs and islands near\r\nthe mouth of the river in hopes of being able to capture the runaways.\r\nOn May 12th, Eugene Lucette was rowing near the mouth of the river,\r\nwhen he discovered the stolen Customs Officer's boat among the mangrove\r\nbushes. He towed the boat up the river and restored it to its proper\r\nowners. Mr. W.A. Duncan, J.P., Mr. Shendon (the customs officer), Mr.\r\nSneyd (the chief constable), and a party of the water police-constables\r\nstarted in pursuit. They had some black trackers with them, and these\r\nsoon found a camp among the mangroves where the convicts had recently\r\nbeen staying. The tracks were patiently followed by the blacks for\r\nsome distance, and at length the party was found near the Cleveland\r\nRoad, about eight miles from Brisbane. They were in a very weak\r\ncondition, having had no food, they said, for four days, and were\r\neasily captured. They had tried to make a living by bushranging along\r\nthe coast, having landed at several points and robbed the few settlers\r\nthere were there then. At Wide Bay they had come on a large camp of\r\nnatives who appeared so hostile that the convicts had been afraid to\r\nland, and had therefore worked their way back to Moreton Bay with the\r\nintention of going up the country to look for work, as they were tired\r\nof living by robbery. They had a number of watches and other articles\r\nof value, two guns and two pistols, all loaded. They were tried on two\r\ncharges, viz:--stealing the Customs Officer's boat, the property of\r\nHer Majesty, &c., and stealing a boat belonging to Ferdinand Gonzales,\r\nfisherman, and were convicted. They were sentenced to fifteen years'\r\npenal servitude.\r\n\r\nThese men had been sent to Norfolk Island for bushranging and other\r\ncrimes committed in Van Diemen's Land, and therefore had nothing to\r\ndo with New South Wales until they landed at Moreton Bay as escapees.\r\nGriffiths, Clegg, and Mitchell were sent back to the island in\r\ncharge of the constable and coxswain who had captured them, and who\r\nwere officials under Mr. John Price, Commandant of the island. The\r\nsix convicted of stealing the Government boat at Brisbane were not\r\nretransported to the island, but were accommodated in the gaol at\r\nMoreton Bay.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to state here that transportation to New South\r\nWales ceased in 1841, and only two vessels conveying convicts reached\r\nthat colony afterwards. These conveyed some prisoners who were\r\nsupposed to be reformed characters, and were known in Australia as\r\n\"Pentonvillains,\" from the name of the Reformatory in London through\r\nwhich they had passed. They were sent out in consequence of an\r\nagitation on the part of the wealthier settlers for the revival of\r\ntransportation, but so much indignation was aroused among the mass of\r\nthe colonists that no further attempts of that kind were made. The\r\nagitation was supported by the Governor, Sir Charles A. Fitzroy, who\r\nsaid in his despatch to Earl Grey, that \"out of about 60,000 persons\r\ntransported hither, 38,000 are reformed and respectable members of the\r\ncommunity. Of the residue, deaths and departures from the colony will\r\naccount for the greater part; and I am enabled to state that only 372\r\nout of the whole are now undergoing punishment of any kind.\" At the\r\ndate of this despatch, January 6, 1850, the colony of New South Wales\r\nincluded the whole of the eastern side of Australia, Victoria being\r\nthen the Port Phillip District, and Queensland the Moreton Bay District\r\nof this colony. The southern portion, or Port Phillip District, was\r\nerected into an independent colony about a year later, and I have dealt\r\nwith the bushranging there during the gold digging era. In New South\r\nWales robberies were also very frequent, although the condition of the\r\ncolony was never so desperate as that of Victoria. In August, 1853,\r\nthe _Bathurst Free Press_ said:--\"For some time past the neighbourhood\r\nof King's Plains has been adding to a murderous notoriety.... There\r\nbloodshed in its most awful shape, murder, appears to be reduced to\r\na science, and the stereotyped phrase 'Murder will out' has lost its\r\nmeaning. An unfortunate old man, remarkable for nothing so much as\r\nhis hospitality, is slaughtered like a sheep and deposited under a\r\nheap of stones.... Some fifteen years have rolled over his grave,\r\nhis death is still enveloped in mystery. A woman in the prime of\r\nlife is shot dead in her house; the walls being bespattered with her\r\nblood. A helpless old shepherd ... who had excited the cupidity or\r\nrevenge of some miscreant, is discovered in the bush, so cut, bruised,\r\nmangled, and disfigured that words are wanting to describe the tigrish\r\nbloodthirstiness of the murderer.... A resident of Bathurst ... starts\r\nfor that bloodstained region one day in perfect health, ... and the\r\nonly evidence of him, living or dead, are the merest fragments of\r\ncalcined bones ... and a few hairs which have been pronounced to be\r\nthose of a human being.\"\r\n\r\nThe indictment was a terrible one and was no doubt true, and the\r\npaper was perfectly justified in urging the Government to make\r\nmore strenuous efforts to stamp out bushranging. Nevertheless the\r\nmurders spoken of here belong to a bygone age, the perpetrators\r\nhaving probably been attracted, like the majority of their class,\r\nto the Victorian goldfields. That was the focus to which all such\r\nenterprising scoundrels were drawn, and there the majority met the\r\nfate they so richly deserved. A few robberies were committed on the\r\nroads in the Bathurst district and in other parts of the colony, but\r\nthe greatest number of such crimes took place in the Manaro district\r\nand along the road leading to Victoria. The only bushranger in New\r\nSouth Wales who became notorious at this time was Thomas Willmore. He\r\nhad been under butler to a gentleman in England, and at the age of\r\nfourteen was transported to \"Botany Bay,\" for having stolen a number of\r\nsilver spoons and other plate from his employer. He was first sent to\r\nPentonville and was then sent to the colony as a reformed character,\r\nbeing among the last of the English convicts sent to New South Wales,\r\nwhere he and his companions were known as \"Earl Grey's pets.\" He was\r\ngranted a ticket-of-leave soon after landing and was assigned as\r\nservant to a settler in the Wellington district. Soon after reaching\r\nthe place he quarrelled with a fellow servant and fired a pistol at\r\nhim. The bullet struck a button and glanced off, and the man escaped,\r\nwhile Willmore, to avoid a trial, took to the bush. He gained a living\r\nby highway robbery for some months. One day he met Philip Alger, near\r\nTomandra, on the Big River. Alger was riding a very fine horse and\r\nWillmore claimed it as one which had been stolen from him, and for\r\nwhich he said he had offered a reward. He demanded that the horse\r\nshould be given to him at once. Alger swore he had purchased the horse\r\nhonestly, and from a man whom he knew, and declined to part with it.\r\nWillmore ended the dispute summarily by drawing a pistol and shooting\r\nAlger in the stomach. Willmore was aware that Alger had a considerable\r\nquantity of gold on him, as the man had foolishly shown it in a hut\r\nwhere both had lodged during the previous night; but Willmore did not\r\nsearch the body and the gold was found on it when it was discovered.\r\nHe seems to have been satisfied with the horse. He mounted it and rode\r\ntowards Wellington. At Montefiore he bargained with Malachi Daly for a\r\ncart, offering for it a quantity of gold dust, which he had no doubt\r\nstolen from some other victim, in exchange. They could not come to an\r\nagreement, but continued their journey towards Wellington together the\r\nnext day. At about nine miles from Wellington on the road to the Big\r\nRiver the road goes down a very steep hill, and both men dismounted to\r\nlead their horses down. Daly was just starting when Willmore stepped\r\nbefore him, pistol in hand, and demanded his money and gold. Daly\r\nprotested that he had left it at his hut, and Willmore called him a\r\n\"liar.\" They disputed for a few minutes, and then Willmore shot Daly\r\nthrough the head. On searching the body Willmore found only thirty\r\nshillings and a deposit receipt for £11, which was of no value to any\r\none except the depositor. Later on Willmore boasted that he got £40\r\nfrom Daly; but, in his last confession, he said he had only asserted\r\nthat he had found £40 on Daly's body because he did not wish it to be\r\nknown that he had \"killed a man for thirty bob.\" Willmore was only just\r\nriding away from where Daly's body was lying when he was ordered to\r\nbail up by another bushranger. Instead of complying with this request\r\nWillmore drew his pistol and fired, both men shooting at the same time.\r\nWillmore's horse bolted, and ran for some considerable distance before\r\nhe could pull him up. When he had once more brought him under control\r\nWillmore wheeled his horse round, and galloped back to the scene of\r\nthe encounter. He tracked his late opponent for a mile or more. He\r\nfelt certain that he had not missed, and expected to find the body\r\nlying somewhere in the bush. Gradually he became convinced that he had\r\nbeen mistaken, and that the bushranger had escaped, and gave up the\r\nsearch, feeling \"very sorry\" that he had not fired straighter. During\r\nthe following three or four weeks he stuck up and robbed a number of\r\npeople on the roads between Wellington and Mudgee, until at length\r\nit was resolved at a public meeting to hunt him down. A large party\r\nassembled by appointment, and this was divided into several smaller\r\nbands, each of which was to travel through the district by a specified\r\nroute, and all were to meet again at a certain time and place and\r\nreport. One party, under the leadership of Mr. Cornish, got on his\r\ntrack and followed it for two days. On the third day they discovered\r\nhim asleep on Ponto Island in the Macquarie River, where he had made a\r\ncamp among the scrub. He was conveyed to Bathurst, tried and convicted\r\nof murder and hung. Great satisfaction was expressed at his capture\r\nhaving been effected without further loss of life, and Mr. Cornish and\r\nthe men under him were highly complimented for the skill they had shown\r\nin tracking him to his lair and their caution in effecting his capture\r\nwithout waking him, as it was highly improbable that he would have\r\nsurrendered without a fight, and his skill and coolness were such as to\r\nmake it almost certain that one man at least would have been shot. In\r\nreporting his trial the _Sydney Morning Herald_ compared him with \"that\r\nmonster Lynch,\" and congratulated the colony on having got rid of \"such\r\na savage.\"\r\n\r\nIn Van Diemen's Land the interregnum between the two bushranging eras\r\nwas shorter than in New South Wales. In fact, in spite of the assertion\r\nthat bushranging had been suppressed with the breaking up of the Cash\r\nand Kavanagh gang, robberies took place occasionally with only short\r\nintervals between them. As a rule, however, there was nothing very\r\nremarkable in them, and only a few seem worthy of notice here. On\r\nFebruary 19th, 1846, Henry Ford and Henry Smart stuck up and robbed a\r\nsmall farmer named Robert Stonehouse, on the Tamar River. They then\r\ncompelled Stonehouse, under threats, to accompany them to the next\r\nfarm and call out his neighbour, John Joynes. When Joynes opened the\r\ndoor the bushrangers rushed in. They tied Joynes and Stonehouse and\r\nransacked the house, taking everything of value. When they left they\r\nwalked along the road and robbed every one they met. On March 5th they\r\nwent to Mr. Philip Oakden's house and rang the bell. Mr. Oakden went\r\nto the door and was immediately confronted with a gun and ordered to\r\nstand. Mr. Oakden informed the robbers that Mrs. Oakden was very ill\r\nand requested them not to make a noise. He said he would give them all\r\nhe had in the house if they would go quietly and not alarm his sick\r\nwife. He gave them three £1 notes and some silver. The robbers insisted\r\non going in and searching the drawers for jewellery, but took nothing.\r\nThey then asked Mr. Oakden for his gold watch. He gave it to them and\r\nthey left, taking Mr. Oakden with them. They stopped at the Rev. Dr.\r\nBrowne's house and made Mr. Oakden enquire whether his friend was at\r\nhome. On Dr. Browne coming to the door he was bailed up, and Ford\r\nasked him \"How much money have you got?\" \"None,\" replied Dr. Browne.\r\n\"Take care I don't find you out in a lie,\" cried Ford; \"where's your\r\nmoney?\" They went in and began searching the drawers and cupboards, and\r\nwhile they were thus employed Chief District Constable Midgeley, who\r\nhad heard that the bushrangers were in the town, came in with another\r\nconstable, and taking the bushrangers unawares captured them, though\r\nnot without trouble. When called on to surrender Ford tried to get out\r\nhis pistol, but Midgeley said, \"If you stir you'll be settled quick.\"\r\nFord and Smart were convicted of highway robbery and death was recorded\r\nagainst them, but the sentences were commuted to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\nA carrier was stopped on the Brighton Road by two armed bushrangers\r\non Sunday, December 6th, 1846. A carpet bag, containing some dress\r\nclothes belonging to Lieutenant Lloyd, of the 96th Regiment, which were\r\nbeing sent to Hobart Town for safety, was stolen. The coat and vest\r\nbuttons were faced with gold. Several other articles were taken from\r\nthe carrier's cart. For this robbery Richard Gordon was apprehended\r\nby District Constable Goldsmith and Constable Daley. On the following\r\nday Henry Jenkins, alias \"Billy from the Den,\" was also captured by\r\nthe police. Billy had broken out of Oatland's Gaol about three months\r\npreviously, and had been living by highway and other robberies since.\r\nThe clothes were offered to Mr. Roberts, a pawnbroker in Hobart Town,\r\nand he, suspecting that they were stolen, communicated with the\r\npolice, who also arrested Michael Cogan, a marine store dealer, as an\r\naccomplice.\r\n\r\nOn December 31st, a party of constables out seeking for bushrangers\r\nfound a boat containing provisions, wearing apparel, &c., on the\r\neast bank of the River Tamar, about eight miles from George Town.\r\nAnother boat was reported to have been stolen from Mr. Coulson. The\r\npolice watched by the boat all day and night. On the next morning,\r\nSunday, they saw two men pulling another boat towards the spot and hid\r\nthemselves in the scrub. When the men landed, the constables appeared\r\nand the men ran away. The constables followed, and ran down one man\r\nnamed Jones. The other bushranger, George Jamieson, was captured by Mr.\r\nHinton and his crew at the Marine Station, near the Heads. Jamieson was\r\nseen in the scrub, near the station, and one of the men, in accordance\r\nwith Australian custom, invited him into the hut to have some food.\r\nJamieson accepted the invitation and, while he was eating, Mr. Hinton\r\ncame in and recognised him. When Mr. Hinton said that he should arrest\r\nhim Jamieson replied, \"I'll be---- if you do,\" and took a tomahawk from\r\nunder his jumper. He was immediately seized from behind by one of Mr.\r\nHinton's men and was handed over to the police.\r\n\r\nThe bushrangers Wilson and Dido were the most notorious about this\r\ntime. They were watching Mr. James Clifford's house, at Piper's\r\nRiver, on September 16th, 1846, and when Mr. Clifford came out they\r\nrushed upon him, took him inside, tied him, and took wearing apparel,\r\nammunition, and other articles out of the drawers and boxes. In\r\nJanuary, Mr. Rees and Mr. Stevenson started from Campbelltown in a\r\ngig for St. Patrick's Head. On reaching the fourth gate on the road,\r\nknown as Davidson's gate, they saw two men with guns. At first they\r\ntook these men for constables. Stevenson got down to open the gate,\r\nand while he was doing so Rees became aware of the character of the\r\ntwo armed men who were approaching, and called out to Stevenson, \"Make\r\nhaste! Here's the bushrangers!\" Stevenson tried to jump into the gig,\r\nbut before he could do so the men were upon him. They presented their\r\nguns and called upon the travellers to surrender. They then ordered\r\nRees to drive the gig off the road into the timber. Mr. Rees objected,\r\nand the bushrangers told him he need not fear, as they intended to\r\nact honourably. \"But what do you want?\" asked Rees. \"We want to rob\r\nyou; we want your money,\" was the reply. \"Then,\" said Mr. Rees, \"why\r\nnot take it here and let us go on?\" The bushrangers made no reply,\r\nbut took the horse by the head and led him away. When the gig was in\r\namong the timber the robbers took £18, a gold watch and chain, and a\r\ngold pencil case, from Mr. Stevenson; and £8 and a silver watch from\r\nMr. Rees. They also took two dress suits and two top coats from the\r\ngig, and then ordered the gentlemen to take off their boots. \"What\r\nfor?\" asked Mr. Rees. \"Because we want them,\" was the reply. \"But,\"\r\ncried Mr. Rees, \"how are we to get home?\" \"Oh, you're all right. You\r\ncan ride while we have to walk,\" said the bushranger. \"But----\" began\r\nMr. Rees, when he was interrupted with, \"Oh, no more nonsense. If you\r\ndon't make haste we'll strip you.\" Stevenson took off his boots, and\r\nRees thought it prudent to follow his example. They returned to their\r\nhomes in Campbelltown two and a-half hours after they had left, and\r\ndeferred their visit to the Heads to another day. On the 27th the\r\npolice were informed that Dido, the bushranger, had been seen in a hut\r\nin Prosser's Forest. A party of constables started immediately, and\r\nreached the place at one a.m. Everything was quiet, and the constables\r\nwalked very cautiously, fearing that if they stepped on a stick and\r\nbroke it the noise would waken the bushranger should he be there. The\r\nconstables took up positions round the hut to prevent escape, and\r\nthen District Constable Davis, who was in command, suddenly burst in\r\nthe door. Dido sprang out of the bed and fell on his knees on the\r\nfloor begging for mercy. He was secured without resistance. In the\r\nhut were a double-barrelled gun and a pistol, both loaded ready for\r\nuse. Mr. Rees's watch and some of Mr. Stevenson's clothes were found\r\nin the hut. When brought up at the police court Dido said he had been\r\ntransported in the name of William Driscoll, but his proper name was\r\nTimothy. Mr. Tarleton, the magistrate, made some remarks on the folly\r\nof men taking to the bush. Dido replied that he should have been happy\r\nenough if he had not been betrayed. He might have lived in luxury for\r\nlife. The man who betrayed him had been his best friend, but he became\r\njealous and gave him up. He had been sixteen times in Launceston. He\r\nhad been drinking about town all day on Christmas Day. He had been\r\nhocussed and had not been well since. Wilson and he had quarrelled and\r\nthey had parted. Wilson was all right. He had a nice little patch of\r\ncultivation, with plenty of flour and some sheep. He was not likely to\r\nbe taken. In spite of this assertion, however, Wilson was captured a\r\nfew days later while drinking at Pitcher's Inn on the Westbury Road.\r\nHe showed a pistol and this excited suspicion, so Mr. Pitcher sent a\r\nservant to inform the police. Constable Leake came and found the man\r\nasleep in a hut at the rear of the public-house. He handcuffed him and\r\ntook him to Launceston in a cart. He was identified as Dido's mate and\r\nwas committed for trial at the same time.\r\n\r\nRobberies of a similar character to these took place from time to time,\r\nbut after the discovery of gold in Australia in 1851 the great object\r\nof the disaffected in Van Diemen's Land was to get to the mainland. No\r\ndoubt many of these men made their way across the Straits in stolen\r\nboats, but the majority paid their passages out of the proceeds of\r\ntheir robberies. Probably it was in consequence of this exodus that\r\nno bushrangers became notorious in Van Diemen's Land at this time,\r\nand a few examples of the crimes committed during the later days\r\nof the epoch will suffice. About the beginning of 1853 a desperate\r\nattempt was made by nine bushrangers, who had been convicted and were\r\nbeing taken from Launceston to Hobart Town, to escape from the two\r\nconstables who had them in charge. The prisoners had been very rowdy\r\nsince leaving Launceston, and when the party was near Bagdad, Convict\r\nJohn Jones suddenly snatched the musket from Constable Doran and felled\r\nthe constable with a blow. Jones then shouted \"Now well fight for\r\nit.\" Constable Mulrooney rushed at Jones and endeavoured to wrest the\r\nmusket from him, but the other prisoners forced him back. The prisoners\r\nwere handcuffed together in threes, and this no doubt hampered their\r\nmovements, but they contrived to get Mulrooney down and beat him with\r\ntheir handcuffs. Convict McCarthy presented the musket at Mulrooney and\r\npulled the trigger, but finding that the gun was not loaded he, in a\r\nrage snapped the stock across his knee. In doing this the bayonet fell\r\noff and both sides struggled to obtain possession of it. At this moment\r\ntwo men appeared along the road, and hearing the noise they hastened\r\nforward. One of them was an assigned shepherd of Captain Chalmers and\r\nwas armed with a double-barrelled gun. Constable Mulrooney was shouting\r\n\"murder,\" and the shepherd came to his assistance. The convicts then\r\ngave up the struggle and fell into rank. They were taken to Bagdad,\r\nand from thence a stronger guard was sent with them until they were\r\nsafely confined in the Pentonville gaol.\r\n\r\nThe bushrangers Dalton and Kelly stuck up and robbed the Halfway House\r\nnear Campbelltown in January, 1853. On the following day they went\r\nto Mr. Simeon Lord's house, Bona Vista, near the river, and bailed\r\nup about thirty people, including the District Constable of Avoca,\r\nthe watch-house keeper, and another constable. The watch-house keeper\r\nwas shot dead. There were several ladies in the house, and these were\r\nordered to go into one room and stay there. The robbers ransacked the\r\nhouse in their search for jewellery and other portable property. They\r\ncollected between £100 and £200, besides several gold and a number of\r\nsilver watches, rings, &c. When they had obtained all that they could\r\nthey compelled Mr. Frank Lord to accompany them to the stables, where\r\nthey selected two of the finest horses, with saddles, bridles, and\r\nspurs. Mounting these horses, the robbers rode away to Mr. Duxbury's\r\nInn at Stoney Creek, where they bailed up twelve men, including two\r\nmounted constables. They collected about £50 more and Mr. Duxbury's\r\ngold watch. On leaving the inn they went along the road, and met Mr.\r\nSykes, recently returned from Melbourne. They robbed him of about £75,\r\nreturning the odd six shillings to enable him to continue his journey.\r\nThey told Mr. Sykes that they intended to rob Captain Creer's and\r\nother houses along the Esk Valley, and, when they had collected all\r\nthey could, to go to the diggings in Victoria. On the following day\r\nthey visited Vaucluse, but Mr. and Mrs. Bayles were away from home\r\nand they got no money. They, however, took some jewellery from the\r\ndrawers and some provisions from the kitchen. During the following\r\nweek they continued their depredations and then went to the coal mines\r\non the river Mersey, and stole a whale boat. They impressed four men\r\nat work there into their service and put to sea, but the wind was so\r\ntempestuous that they were driven back and landed on the coast near\r\nPort Sorell, where they were captured.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1853, a man named Robinson, who had recently returned\r\nfrom the Victorian diggings, shot a shoemaker named William Moonan,\r\nwhile he was waxing a thread. The murderer dragged the body from the\r\nhut to the Swan River and threw it in, and then returned to steal\r\nwhat little money there was in the place. The bushrangers Maberley,\r\nHickson, and Poulston committed a number of daylight burglaries in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Sandy Bay, robbing the houses of Messrs. Stacey,\r\nFrodsham, Power, and Dunkley. From Dunkley's they took more than twenty\r\npounds' worth of goods. They had supper at Mr. Winter's and then went\r\nto camp in the bush not far away.\r\n\r\nMoses Birkett and Peter Perry were captured in a cave about this time.\r\nThe cave was on the shores of Lake Crescent, and a large quantity of\r\nstolen property was found hidden there. Besides the guns and pistols,\r\na couple of sheep shear blades, mounted on long wooden handles were\r\nfound, and it was supposed that these had been used in the murder of\r\nGeorge Kelsey, at Lemon Springs.\r\n\r\nThanks to the activity of the police and the assistance they received\r\nfrom the civilians, such malefactors were gradually captured and\r\ndealt with. Some of the Victorian papers charged the Government of\r\nVan Diemen's Land with conniving at the escape of expirees from the\r\nisland to Victoria, but there does not appear to be any foundation for\r\nthis charge. It is quite possible that neither the authorities nor\r\nthe public were sorry to be relieved from their company, but we have\r\nmerely to read the accounts published at the time, to realise that all\r\nwas done that was possible to suppress bushranging in Van Diemen's\r\nLand at this time, and that the escapes of these criminals across the\r\nBass's Straits could not very well be prevented. It was in 1853 that\r\ntransportation to the island ceased. A few years later, responsible\r\ngovernment was established, and the name of the island was changed\r\nfrom Van Diemen's Land to Tasmania, with the object of getting rid as\r\nmuch as possible of old associations. Very shortly afterwards, the\r\npapers once more said that bushranging had been stamped out in the\r\nisland, and this time they were justified in the assertion. No doubt\r\nthe larger settlements on the mainland offered better chances to the\r\nenterprising Tasmanians, whether they were \"old hands\" or not. Tasmania\r\nhas, perhaps in consequence of this custom of young men going to seek\r\ntheir fortunes in Melbourne or Sydney, progressed less rapidly than\r\nsome of the other colonies, but it has progressed, and this progression\r\nhas been as peaceful and as innocent as possible under present social\r\nconditions, and the island which was once infamous has for many years\r\nbeen remarkably clear from criminal offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  The New Bushranging Era; Fallacy of the Belief that Highwaymen Rob\r\n  the Rich to Enrich the Poor; The Cattle Duffers and Horse Planters;\r\n  The Riot at the Lambing Flat; Frank Gardiner, the Butcher; Charged\r\n  with Obtaining Beasts \"on the cross,\" he Abandons his Butcher's Shop;\r\n  Efforts to Establish a Reign of Terror in the District; A Letter from\r\n  Gardiner; The Great Escort Robbery.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto the bushrangers of Australia had been, as the records prove,\r\ndrawn almost exclusively from the ranks of those who \"left their\r\ncountry for their country's good.\" Those who took the most prominent\r\nshare in the next outbreak of the \"epidemic\" were generally native-born\r\nAustralians. The _sequelæ_ of the old disease were not yet worked\r\nout. As I have already said, there were numbers of the \"old hands\"\r\nscattered about the bush, some of them with farms or small cattle or\r\nsheep stations of their own who lived fairly honest and useful lives,\r\nbut even among these, whatever may have been their station in life,\r\nthere was the old antagonism to \"law and order,\" and their sympathies\r\nwere all with those who waged war against society. Their children\r\nimbibed these ideas, and wherever there was a neighbourhood where\r\nthis class had collected together, morality was at a low ebb. But\r\nbesides these settlers there were numbers of nomads, men who worked\r\nas shepherds, bullock-drivers, splitters and fencers, shearers, and\r\nso on, and as long as the old hands formed a majority, or even a\r\nconsiderable minority of the bush-workers, it was the custom for men to\r\nwork from shearing to shearing, or from harvest to harvest, and then\r\n\"draw their cheques,\" make for the nearest public-house, and indulge\r\nin a wild spree, until they were informed by the landlord that the\r\nmoney which their cheques represented had been expended. There were\r\nsome respectable inns in the back country where they got fair value\r\nfor their money perhaps, but in too many of these \"bush pubs,\" as\r\nthey were called, the object of the landlord was to \"lamb them down\"\r\nin the shortest possible space of time. Perhaps when the character\r\nof the liquor sold in these places is taken into consideration, this\r\nmethod of cheating was not altogether an evil. It prevented the bushmen\r\nfrom swallowing such large quantities of the deleterious stuff as\r\nthey might have done if they had received full value for their money.\r\nDuring the time when they were working their principal mode of amusing\r\nthemselves was telling or listening to tales of the convict days.\r\nSome of these stories told by the old hands were of too revolting a\r\ncharacter for repetition, but no doubt they were founded on fact.\r\nNothing is too horrible or obscene to have been true of the convict\r\ntimes. The stories, however, which appear to have had the greatest\r\ninfluence over the minds of a certain class of Australian youth were\r\nthose told of the bushrangers. In these stories there was of course\r\nmuch that was apocryphal, to put it mildly. Many of the exploits of the\r\nhistoric highwaymen of old were told as actual facts in the careers of\r\nsome Australian bushrangers, with just sufficient variation to adapt\r\nthem to local purposes. One of the ancient superstitions introduced\r\ninto Australia by these story-tellers was that the highwaymen robbed\r\nthe rich to give to the poor. I have no desire to raise any doubts as\r\nto the generosity and benevolence of Robin Hood, but I can find no\r\nevidence of any such beneficence on the part of any of the Australian\r\nbushrangers. No doubt they got their money easily, and spent it\r\nrecklessly. But they did not pause to enquire whether the person they\r\nrobbed was rich or poor. There was no such class distinction in the\r\ncolonies as there is and always has been in England; no very poor\r\nclass not worth robbing and ready to bless anyone who gave them a\r\npenny, and no hereditary wealthy class. Every one had to work somehow\r\nfor his living, though some were more successful in piling up wealth\r\nthan others. But the poor had opportunities which have never existed\r\nin England, and if they neglected them it was more or less their own\r\nfault if they were poor. The tendency in Australia, as elsewhere, is\r\nto build up a wealthy class, but this class did not exist in convict\r\ntimes, and is only just beginning to appear now. The Australian\r\nbushranger in fact had to obtain money or go under. He was compelled to\r\nshare his ill-gotten gains with those who supplied him with food and\r\ninformation. He was a mark for the blackmailer, and he was compelled to\r\nfind money to bribe those who were in a position to lead the troops or\r\nthe police to his hiding place. But the convict bushranger was not so\r\nwell off as the native-born bushranger. There was a strong feeling of\r\ncamaraderie, an _esprit de corps_, among the convicts, which tended to\r\nprevent numbers of men from betraying him, even though they received no\r\nbribes. But the new bushranger was more fortunate than the old one. He\r\nhad his parents, his brothers and sisters, his cousins and his aunts\r\nand uncles, who sympathised with him for family and other reasons,\r\nand who were bound to help him. It was from among these relatives and\r\nfriends that the \"bush telegraphs,\" who informed the bushranger of the\r\nwhereabouts of the police, were drawn, and it soon became apparent\r\nthat if bushranging was to be abolished these sympathisers and \"bush\r\ntelegraphs\" must be dealt with.\r\n\r\nThere were several localities in New South Wales where the conditions\r\nwere favourable for bushranging; places where the morality was low and\r\nwhere the police, as representatives of authority, were hated with\r\nall the hatred of the \"old hand.\" One of these localities was in the\r\nspurs of the Great Dividing Range, in the neighbourhood of Burrowa.\r\nAll round this district were a number of small squatters, principally\r\ncattle breeders, and among these no man's beast was safe. These small\r\nsquatters were the terror of the big sheep and cattle breeders in\r\nthe plains, and their principal industry was \"duffing.\" Duffing was\r\nnot stealing. If a moralist had remonstrated with a Burrowa man whom\r\nhe found branding his neighbour's beast, the Burrowa man would have\r\nreplied \"I'm only trying to get back my own. He's duffed many a head\r\nof my cattle.\" Sheep could be duffed as well as cattle, but the ranges\r\nwere generally too steep for sheep. One sheep breeder of the district,\r\nhowever, adopted, as his distinguishing mark, the plan of cutting off\r\nboth ears, and he was a most successful duffer, because his recognised\r\near-mark enabled him to remove the ear-marks in his neighbours' sheep.\r\nIt was no uncommon occurrence for a man to find that a calf sucking\r\nhis cow had been branded by one of his neighbours, so that it might be\r\nclaimed as soon as it was weaned. In such a case, if he had complained,\r\nhis neighbour would probably have accused him of having \"mothered\" the\r\nneighbour's calf on his cow for the purpose of cheating him out of it.\r\n\r\nIn such a neighbourhood it was impossible for any stranger to travel\r\nwith horses with any degree of safety. Horses bred in the district\r\ncould be duffed like sheep or cattle, and horses travelling through\r\ncould be \"planted.\" If a man, who knew anything of the characteristics\r\nof the settlers in this district, camped for the night there, and\r\nfailed to find his horses next morning, he did not waste time in\r\nlooking for them himself. He realised at once that one of \"the boys\"\r\nhad driven them off into some inaccessible ravine in the ranges, and\r\n\"planted\" or hidden them there until a reward should be offered for\r\ntheir recovery. He would therefore go to the nearest station and\r\nenquire whether his horses had been seen. The answer would be \"No.\"\r\nThen the traveller would say that he was willing to pay \"a note\"\r\nfor their recovery. The reply of the native would probably be that\r\nhorses always went astray about there. There was such a get-away for\r\nthem, and the warrigals came down and enticed them off. The story of\r\nthe warrigals, or wild horses, tempting working horses away was a\r\ncommon fiction. Hobbled horses could not keep up with the warrigals\r\nacross the ridges. But it was sufficiently plausible to serve. If the\r\nworking horses broke their hobbles they might perhaps go with the wild\r\nhorses, but even then it is uncertain. However, after a few minutes'\r\nconversation, the native would probably say that if any one could\r\nfind the horses it was \"Jack the Kid,\" or some other local character,\r\nas he knew every gully in the ridges. The wideawake traveller could\r\nunderstand that \"Jack the Kid\" was the man who had planted his horses,\r\nand would not return them for less than \"a note,\" that is £1, and on\r\nthis reward for villainy being promised the traveller might go to\r\nhis camp with the certainty that the horses would be brought to him\r\nin about an hour. It would be useless to look for them, because the\r\nplanter would be on the watch, and if the owner was seen approaching\r\nthe gully where they were the horses would be driven over the ridge\r\ninto the next gully. Cases have happened where a traveller has\r\npersisted in refusing to be blackmailed and has lost his horses. It\r\nwould be only necessary to cut the hobbles. Then the traveller, if he\r\nwanted his horses, would have to engage two or three expert stockmen to\r\nrun them in. It was useless to complain to the police. The horses had\r\nnot been stolen. They were there. Let the owner come and fetch them.\r\nNobody would prevent him and some kind settler would even offer the use\r\nof his stockyard if the owner could drive them into it.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of the district when the rush to the\r\nnewly-discovered Lambing Flat goldfield took place in 1860. Early in\r\nthe following year there was a great \"roll up\" of the diggers to drive\r\nthe Chinese off the field, and the military were sent up from Sydney to\r\nrestore order. In this riot the peculiar morality of the diggers, of\r\nwhich I have already spoken, was illustrated in a remarkable degree.\r\nThe leaders of the riots strictly forbade robbery, and any person found\r\nstealing gold or any other property from the Chinese was to be handed\r\nover to the police; but burning the humpies, tents, and other property\r\nof the unfortunate Chinkies, cutting off their pigtails, beating or\r\notherwise ill-treating them, as an inducement for them to leave the\r\nfield, were justifiable if not meritorious acts. In after years many of\r\nthe \"flash diggers\" wore sashes made of Chinamen's pigtails, sometimes\r\nwith just as much of the scalp attached as would prevent the hairs\r\nfrom scattering. However, the riots did not last long and the leader,\r\nWilliam Spicer, was sent to gaol.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, many of the young men of the district in the\r\ngoldfields and, as far as is known, these conformed to the rules\r\nlaid down by the diggers with regard to property. But this did not\r\naffect their own peculiar notions as to the ownership of cattle,\r\nsheep, or horses, and the attention of the police was early drawn to\r\nthe district. Warrants were soon issued for numbers of the youths on\r\ncharges of horse or cattle stealing, and several were arrested. Later\r\nit was said that many young fellows, who might have remained at home,\r\nwere \"driven on to the roads\" by the police. That is to say that,\r\nbecause they were interfered with in their favourite amusements of\r\nduffing and planting, they turned bushrangers.\r\n\r\nAmong the residents on the diggings was Frank Gardiner, who opened\r\na butcher's shop on Wombat Flat. Gardiner was born at Boro Creek,\r\nnear Tarago, in the heart of the district in which Jackey Jackey\r\nhad first won his notoriety as a bushranger, and the morals of that\r\ndistrict were very similar to those I have described as prevalent in\r\nthe Burrowa district. Gardiner went to the diggings in Victoria in\r\nthe \"Fifties,\" was arrested near Ballarat, and tried at Geelong for\r\nhorse-stealing. He was sent to gaol for five years. He escaped from\r\nthe Pentridge stockade and returned home. Shortly afterwards he was\r\nconvicted of horse-stealing at Goulburn and sentenced to seven years'\r\nimprisonment on two charges, the sentences being made concurrent. He\r\nserved half the term and was granted a ticket-of-leave. His butcher's\r\nshop at Burrangong, to give the diggings its proper name, was said\r\nto be the resort of all the worst characters among the young natives\r\nof the district, and the majority of the beasts he slaughtered and\r\nsold were said to be obtained \"on the cross.\" Becoming aware that a\r\nwarrant had been issued for his arrest he abandoned his shop and took\r\nto the mountains. Here he organised a band of bushrangers, and shortly\r\nafterwards reports of people being stuck up and robbed on the roads\r\nround the diggings became frequent.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the young Australian had not taken to cricket and football\r\nso enthusiastically as he did later, and perhaps there were few\r\nopportunities for him to get rid of his superfluous energy. Whether\r\nthis is so or not, it is certain that Gardiner's example had an\r\nenormous influence. Not only were those against whom warrants had\r\nbeen issued for cattle and horse-stealing ready to join the gang,\r\nbut numbers of young men and lads who had hitherto led blameless\r\nlives became so excited that they turned out and tried their hands at\r\nbushranging.\r\n\r\nThe first robberies were in the immediate neighbourhood of Burrangong,\r\nbut very soon the area over which the bushrangers operated was\r\nenlarged, and finally embraced the whole colony, and even overflowed\r\ninto the neighbouring colonies. At first, however, Gardiner and his\r\ngang claim our attention, but there were many young men who began as\r\nindependent bushrangers who made their way to the Burrangong district\r\nto join the gang, and others who intended to do so who were captured\r\non the road. It is a difficult matter to decide who did and who did\r\nnot belong to this gang, as the _personnel_ changed so rapidly. Some\r\nactual members of the gang acted independently of it for a time, and\r\nmade raids into other districts, while others, after having a flutter\r\nwith Gardiner, left the gang to start elsewhere. The bushrangers did\r\nnot confine their attentions to travellers on the roads. They robbed\r\nwhenever and wherever an opportunity occurred. Thus on August 19th,\r\n1861, Henry Keene, Michael Lawler, and William Watson went to Mr.\r\nBrennan's station, on the Billabong, and called out \"All hands in, or\r\nwe'll blow your brains out.\" Mr. and Mrs. Brennan and a number of men\r\nwho were working at the station were gathered about the verandah of the\r\nhouse smoking and talking. Mrs. Brennan cried out in alarm, \"They're\r\ngoing to shoot.\" James Laurie, one of the men, replied, \"Let them shoot\r\naway.\" However, the men went inside, as they were told, and Lawler\r\ndismounted and followed them. Keene took his place as sentry at the\r\ndoor, and Watson remained on horseback outside. Laurie said to Lawler,\r\n\"You're the man that was looking for a gray mare.\" \"What if I was?\r\nWhat is it to you?\" returned Lawler. Laurie picked up a big stick from\r\nthe fire and made a blow at Lawler, when a shot was fired, presumably\r\neither by Keene or Watson, and Laurie fell. He cried out for water, and\r\nMrs. Brennan told her little daughter to go out and fetch a glassful,\r\nbut Lawler would not permit her to leave the room. Lawler was very\r\nviolent. He threatened to shoot any one who opposed him, and to \"put\r\na firestick to the house\" if Mrs. Brennan did not give him her money.\r\nOne of the bushrangers went to a hawker named Isaac Lavendale, camped\r\nclose by, and made him go into the house. Lavendale gave the wounded\r\nman some milk and spilt some on his face. He said, \"I'm dying--don't\r\nlet them--don't let----\" and then he died. Keene fired a ball through\r\nthe roof of the house and said: \"I---- quick took the flashness out\r\nof that man. He won't be so flash again.\" The robbers collected all\r\nthe money they could, and took clothes and other articles from the\r\nhawker's cart. The robbers were subsequently captured by the police,\r\nand on March 23rd, 1862, were convicted at Goulburn and sentenced to\r\ndeath. Sir Alfred Stephen told them to prepare to meet their God, when\r\nKeene and Lawler both said that they were ready. They were innocent.\r\nWatson said: \"I don't care if it's to-morrow; I hope you won't keep me\r\nlike you did Johnson.\" When taken from court, Watson shouted, \"Well,\r\ngood-bye.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Ross, William Mackie, and John McMahon, alias McManus, robbed\r\nthe mail at the Chain of Ponds, on the Great North Road, on October\r\n17th. They searched the letters, took a gold and a silver watch,\r\ntwo gold chains, and £55 in notes and coin from Mr. Jonathan Snell,\r\n£23 from Mr. Thomas Lumley, and smaller sums and valuables from the\r\nother two passengers. On the 30th, Constable Leonard saw Mackie in a\r\npublic house at Lochinvar, near Maitland, and challenged him. Mackie\r\nattempted to run, but was followed and captured. He threw away a gold\r\nwatch, which was picked up and identified as one stolen from Mr. Snell.\r\nRoss and McMahon were discovered not far away and were arrested.\r\nWhen tried they were convicted, but Ross was recommended to mercy on\r\naccount of his previous good character. He was sentenced to five years'\r\nimprisonment, his companions being sent to gaol for seven years.\r\n\r\nMichael Henry Davis, Aaron von Ehrstein, and Robert Smith, stopped\r\nthe mail coach on January 6th, 1862, about six miles from Burrangong.\r\nEnsign Campbell Morris and Sergeant O'Grady, of the 12th regiment,\r\nwhich had been engaged in suppressing the riot, were passengers going\r\nto Cowra. Another passenger, a Frenchman, refused to surrender, and\r\nDavis fired at him. After this no further resistance was made, and\r\nEhrstein, who searched the passengers, took £9 13s. from the Ensign and\r\nother sums from the others. The police started in pursuit immediately\r\non receiving information of the robbery, and the prisoners were\r\ncaptured without much trouble. They were convicted and sent to gaol for\r\nten years.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Allerton and another man walked one day into the bar of\r\nthe Wakool Hotel on the lower Billabong and called for nobblers like\r\nordinary travellers. They were served by Mr. Talbot, the landlord. They\r\nthen went into the dining room and had supper. As soon as the meal was\r\nover the two men rose, and one of them drew a pistol and said, \"Excuse\r\nus, gentlemen, this is our business.\" David Elliott, who was employed\r\nat the hotel, was sitting next the bushranger, and made a snatch at the\r\npistol. The bushranger, however, was on the alert, and jumped aside.\r\nThen he fired and Elliott fell wounded. Mr. Talbot rushed in from the\r\nbar and said that he didn't want any more damage done. \"Take the money\r\nin the till,\" he cried, \"and go.\" The bushrangers took some seven or\r\neight pounds from the till, a saddle and bridle, a canister of powder,\r\nand some clothing, but they took nothing from the other persons who\r\nhad been at supper with them. They said that they were going to join\r\nGardiner and \"make it hot for the traps.\" Information was at once given\r\nto the police, and they were followed, but only Allerton was found and\r\ncaptured. He was tried at Goulburn on March 27th and found guilty, the\r\njury pronouncing the verdict without leaving the box, and the judge\r\nsentenced him to death. Benjamin Allerton and Henry Keene were hung\r\nat Goulburn on May 5th. Another bushranger named Regan was hung there\r\nin June. The sentences on Lawler and Watson were commuted to fifteen\r\nyears' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThese were outsiders who intended to join the gang, but in the meantime\r\nthe gang itself had not been idle. John Peisley was a well-known\r\nsettler in the district, and his house was said to be the resort of\r\nthe bushrangers, and was closely watched by the police. On December\r\n27th, 1861, Peisley and James Wilson were drinking at Benyon's Inn,\r\nabout a mile from Bigga, when Peisley challenged William Benyon to\r\nrun, jump, or fight for £10. Benyon declined, and Peisley struck him\r\nseveral light blows on the chest and called him a coward, until at\r\nlength Benyon said he would wrestle. They went into the yard, leaving\r\nWilson, who was drunk, on the seat in the bar. Stephen Benyon, who\r\nwas at work in the barn, and several others, collected in the yard to\r\nsee the wrestling match. The men stripped, and grappled, and Peisley\r\nthrew the publican and then struck him in the face. Stephen Benyon\r\ncalled Peisley a coward, rushed forward and threw Peisley. On getting\r\nup Peisley rushed into the house swearing he would \"do for Bill.\" He\r\nseized a knife, when Mrs. Benyon cried out \"My God! are you going to\r\nkill my husband?\" and grappled with him. Stephen Benyon picked up a\r\nspade and struck Peisley on the arm. Peisley then threw away the knife\r\nand said it was all right. The row seemed to be all over and Peisley\r\nwalked into the bar and asked Wilson where his vest was. He had taken\r\nit off when he went out to wrestle and left it beside Wilson. Wilson\r\nsaid he had not seen it. Then Mrs. Benyon announced that she had hidden\r\nit because she found two revolvers rolled up in it. She offered to tell\r\nPeisley where it was if he would promise to go away quietly. Peisley\r\nsaid all right, and Mrs. Benyon showed him where she had hidden the\r\nvest in the garden. Peisley walked out, picked the vest up from under\r\na bush, and went back again. He began to examine the revolvers, when\r\nWilliam Benyon said, \"Surely you don't mean to shoot us?\" \"You never\r\nknew me do a mean action in my life,\" replied Peisley, \"and I'm not\r\ngoing to begin now. Shake hands. We're all friends.\" They shook hands\r\nall round and Peisley put on his vest and went away. As soon as he was\r\nout of sight, William Benyon loaded his gun and took it to the barn,\r\nwhere his brother Stephen had returned to his work. William gave the\r\ngun to his brother and told him to take care of it, as Peisley was not\r\nto be trusted. About half-an-hour later, when William Benyon was in\r\nthe bar, Peisley came galloping back, hitched his horse to the fence,\r\nand went into the barn. Stephen Benyon picked up the gun and Peisley\r\nsaid, laughing, \"Why, you're not going to shoot me, are you?\" \"I was\r\ntold you were going to shoot me,\" returned Stephen. \"Nonsense,\" cried\r\nPeisley, \"I never did a cowardly action in my life, and I'm not going\r\nto now. Shake hands.\" Stephen put the gun down and shook hands, and\r\nPeisley immediately seized the gun and fired, wounding Stephen in the\r\narm. Stephen ran out of the barn and towards the house, and Peisley,\r\ntaking careful aim, again pulled the trigger, but the cap missed fire.\r\nPeisley ran to the corner of the house, and asked William Benyon's son\r\nwhich way his uncle went. The child pointed in the wrong direction,\r\nand Peisley ran to the other corner of the house. Not seeing Stephen\r\nanywhere he returned. He was in a great rage, and struck a man named\r\nGeorge Hammond with the gun, which exploded without doing any damage.\r\nPeisley threw the gun away, and drew a revolver. He ordered William\r\nBenyon, Wilson, Hammond, and the servant girl into the barn. Then he\r\nsaid to William, \"I've got a bullet here for you. You've had your\r\ngame, now it's my turn.\" The servant went between Benyon and Peisley,\r\nand begged the bushranger not to hurt her master. Peisley told her to\r\ngo away unless she was tired of her life. Suddenly Benyon rushed at\r\nPeisley, who fired and wounded him in the neck, and as he fell Peisley\r\nrushed out to his horse, mounted, and galloped away. William Benyon\r\ndied a week later, and a warrant was issued for the apprehension of\r\nPeisley, who left his house and joined the gang. On January 15th\r\nConstables Morris, Murphy, and Simpson were searching for bushrangers\r\nin the Abercrombie Mountains, when they saw Peisley near Bigga. The\r\nbushranger was splendidly mounted. He rode up, and coolly informed\r\nthe police that he was the man they were looking for. He added, \"I'd\r\nlike to have a turn up with Morris if he will get down, and put his\r\ngun aside.\" Morris replied, \"All right,\" and immediately dismounted,\r\nand placed his gun against a tree, expecting his challenger to do the\r\nsame. But Peisley laughed, turned his horse round, and cantered away.\r\nMorris drew a revolver from his belt and fired. The bullet passed just\r\nunder the neck of the bushranger's horse. He turned in his saddle\r\nand said \"That was a good one. Try again.\" The police gave chase,\r\nbut the superiority of the bushranger's horse enabled him to escape\r\neasily. About a week later Peisley was captured by Messrs. Mackenzie\r\nand Burridge after a severe struggle. He was tried at Bathurst, and\r\nsentenced to death for the murder of William Benyon, and was hung on\r\nApril 25th, 1862. When on the scaffold he said that he had never used\r\nviolence during his bushranging career until he had had that row with\r\nBenyon. He had never taken a shilling from or done violence to a woman.\r\nHe denied that he had had anything to do with the attempt to bribe\r\nConstable Hosie to let Gardiner escape. He was aware that the money\r\noffered was £50. He also knew that there was a cheque for £2 10s. in\r\nthe collection, and that made the amount up to £50 10s. He had spent\r\nfive or six pounds in the spree at Benyon's. Wilson wanted him to sing\r\nand Benyon to dance, but he refused. Benyon then asked him to put on\r\nthe gloves, but he declined because he knew it would lead to a row.\r\nAt this point, said the _Bathurst Free Press_, one of the clergymen\r\non the scaffold whispered to Peisley, and he immediately said that\r\nhe would say no more on that subject. He concluded with \"Good-bye,\r\ngentlemen. God bless you.\" Peisley did not appear to suffer much, but a\r\nblackfellow, known as Jacky Bullfrog, who was hanged at the same time\r\nfor the murder of William Clarke, suffered terribly, his body being\r\nfrightfully convulsed for several minutes. Peisley was twenty-eight\r\nyears of age, five feet ten inches in height. He is described as a\r\nfine-looking man at a distance, but when examined closely there was a\r\nshifty, disagreeable look about his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn April Gardiner, with three companions, stuck up Pring's Crowther\r\nstation and then went on to Crooke's, and bailed up all hands there.\r\nAt Pring's, one of the bushrangers played the piano while the others\r\ndanced. At Crooke's one played the concertina and another sang \"Ever of\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 10th, Mr. Horsington, a store-keeper on the Wombat, was\r\ndriving with his wife in a spring cart to Lambing Flat, and Mr. Robert\r\nHewitt, store-keeper at Little Wombat, riding beside them. Suddenly,\r\nJames Downey, with three other bushrangers, barred the road and ordered\r\nthe travellers into the bush. The two store-keepers had a large\r\nquantity of gold with them which they had purchased in the course of\r\nbusiness, and were taking to the bank at Lambing Flat, the main centre\r\nof the Burrangong Goldfield. Mr. Horsington had a parcel containing\r\nforty ounces in his pockets, and another of two hundred ounces in the\r\ncart. The robbers took some £1100 worth from Mr. Horsington in gold\r\nand money, and about £700 worth from Mr. Hewitt. When pocketing the\r\nplunder, Downey said: \"You're the best gentlemen I've met this month,\r\nand I've stuck up twenty already.\"\r\n\r\nSergeant Sanderson, with detectives Lyons and Kennedy, left the Lachlan\r\nGoldfield (Forbes), on April 11th, in charge of three bushrangers who\r\nhad been arrested, and who were being taken to Burrangong for the\r\npolice court examinations. Near Brewers' Shanty, three horsemen, with\r\ntwo led horses, were observed, and on seeing the coach these horsemen\r\nturned into the bush. The two detectives followed them on foot, when\r\nthe horsemen turned round and fired. The police returned the fire,\r\nand the horses of two of the bushrangers bolted. The third bushranger\r\nremained and fired again. The police replied and the bushranger fell.\r\nHe was identified as a man named Davis. He had received four wounds,\r\nnone of which was very serious. He was placed in the coach with the\r\nother prisoners, and was subsequently sentenced to death. This sentence\r\nwas, however, commuted to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the Burrangong and other papers in the\r\ndisturbed area accused the Government of neglect in consequence of the\r\nnon-arrival in the district of Captain Battye with his troop of black\r\ntrackers. It was said that without this aid the police might ride round\r\nfor months, but could not penetrate the ranges. No doubt this outcry\r\nhad the effect of stirring up the authorities, because the blacks\r\nspeedily arrived and were set to work without delay.\r\n\r\nThe _Lachlan Miner_ of April 19th, 1862, inserted the following\r\nparagraph:--\r\n\r\n  \"We have received the following letter, purporting to be from the\r\n  hand of Frank Gardner (_sic_), the notorious highwayman, of Lachlan\r\n  and Lambing Flat roads. The circumstances under which we became\r\n  possessed of the documents can be known, and the original copies,\r\n  with the envelopes and seals, seen by the curious, on application\r\n  at this office, and they can then use what judgment they choose\r\n  as to the genuineness of them. We give it to our readers as we\r\n  received it:--'To the Editor of the _Burrangong Miner_, Lambing\r\n  Flat. Sir,--Having seen a paragraph in one of the papers, wherein\r\n  it is said that I took the boots off a man's feet, and that I also\r\n  took the last few shillings that another man had, I wish it to be\r\n  made known that I did not do anything of the kind. The man who took\r\n  the boots was in my company, and for so doing I discharged him the\r\n  following day. Silver I never took from a man yet, and the shot that\r\n  was fired at the sticking-up of Messrs. Horsington and Hewitt was by\r\n  accident, and the man who did it I also discharged. As for a mean,\r\n  low, or petty action, I never committed it in my life. The letter\r\n  that I last sent to the press, there had not half of what I said put\r\n  in it. In all that has been said there never was any mention made\r\n  of my taking the sergeant's horse and trying him, and that when I\r\n  found he was no good I went back and got my own. As for Mr. Torpy, he\r\n  is a perfect coward. After I spared his life as he fell out of the\r\n  window, he fired at me as I rode away; but I hope that Mr. Torpy and\r\n  I have not done just yet, until we balance our accounts properly. Mr.\r\n  Greig has accused me of robbing his teams, but it is false, for I\r\n  know nothing about the robbery whatever. In fact I would not rob Mr.\r\n  Greig or any one belonging to him, on account of his taking things\r\n  so easy at Bogolong. Mr. Torpy was too bounceable or he would not\r\n  have been robbed. A word to Sir W.F. Pottinger. He wanted to know\r\n  how it was the man who led my horse up to me at the Pinnacle, did\r\n  not cut my horse's reins, as he gave me the horse. I should like to\r\n  know if Mr. Pottinger would do so? I shall answer by saying no. It\r\n  has been said that it would be advisable to place a trap at each\r\n  shanty on the road, to put a stop to the depredations done on the\r\n  road. I certainly think it would be a great acquisition to me, for I\r\n  should then have increase of revolvers and carbines. When seven or\r\n  eight men could do nothing with me at the Pinnacle, one would look\r\n  well at a shanty. Three of your troopers were at a house the other\r\n  night and got drinking and gambling till all hours. I came there\r\n  towards morning when all was silent. The first room that I went into\r\n  I found revolvers and carbines to any amount, but seeing none as good\r\n  as my own, I left them. I then went out, and in the verandah found\r\n  the troopers sound asleep, satisfying myself that neither Battye\r\n  nor Pottinger were there, I left them as I found them, in the arms\r\n  of Morpheus. Fearing nothing, I remain, Prince of Tobymen, Francis\r\n  Gardner (_sic_), the Highwayman. Insert the foregoing, and rest\r\n  satisfied you shall be paid.\"\r\n\r\nThe spelling of the name appears to be a typographical blunder. Mr.\r\nTorpy was a well-known resident of the district. This letter throws\r\nsome light on the methods pursued by the bushrangers, and tends to\r\nprove that although Gardiner might not be present on some occasions,\r\nthe robberies were committed under his directions. And some fresh\r\noutrage was reported almost every day, until in June, the report that\r\nthe Government gold escort from the Lachlan diggings had been stuck\r\nup and robbed, caused a commotion throughout the colony. The escort\r\nstarted from Forbes on June 15th with 2067 oz. 18 dwt. gold and £700,\r\nowned by the Oriental Bank; 521 oz. 13 dwt. 6 grs., owned by the\r\nBank of New South Wales, and 129 oz. and £3000 in cash, owned by the\r\nCommercial Banking Company, making about fourteen thousand pounds worth\r\nin all.\r\n\r\nThe report of this robbery caused intense excitement throughout the\r\ncolony. Nothing like it had been heard of since the old gold digging\r\ndays in Victoria. Large bodies of police were sent out to scour the\r\ncountry near the scene of the outrage. One of these parties of police\r\nunder Sergeant Saunderson, when in the ranges near Wheogo, saw a man on\r\nhorseback who rode away as they approached. The police followed him up\r\nthe steep gully, and when he was near the top four other men joined him\r\nfrom behind the trees and made off too. The police followed so rapidly\r\nthat a packhorse which one of the men was leading broke away and they\r\nhad not time to recover him. The police seized the packhorse, but the\r\nmen got away. On the captured horse were found about 1500 oz. of gold,\r\na policeman's cloak, and two carbines which were identified as having\r\nbeen among those with which the troopers of the escort had been armed.\r\nIt may be remarked _en passant_ that no more of the property stolen in\r\nthis robbery was ever recovered.\r\n\r\nSome weeks later the police succeeded in apprehending Alexander\r\nFordyce, John Bow, Henry Manns, John McGuire, and Daniel Charters, and\r\nthese were committed for trial for having been concerned in the escort\r\nrobbery. Charters turned approver, and his evidence given at the trial\r\nmay be taken as a substantially true account of the method by which the\r\nrobbery was effected; although, of course, due allowance must be made\r\nfor the apparent efforts of the witness to minimise his own share in\r\nthe crime.\r\n\r\nCharters lived with his parents at Humbug Creek and knew the country\r\nwell. One day Frank Gardiner met him near the Pinnacle and compelled\r\nhim to lead the way across the ranges to Eugowra. Johnny Gilbert and\r\nAlick Fordyce were driving several spare horses which the gang had\r\ncollected. They camped near the Lachlan River and Gilbert went into\r\nthe town of Forbes, the centre of the Lachlan River diggings. It was\r\nSunday, and on his return to the camp Gilbert reported that he had had\r\ngreat difficulty in purchasing guns and an axe. There was only one\r\nstore in the town in which guns were sold, and that was shut. He had\r\nknocked the store-keeper up, however, and persuaded him to supply him\r\nwith what he wanted. On the next morning the gang rode as straight as\r\npossible across the ranges, Gilbert going ahead with Charters to cut\r\nthe fences on Mr. Roberts' sheep run to enable them to pass through.\r\nThey camped for the night between the Eugowra Rocks and Campbell's\r\nstation. On the morning of June 15th, 1862, they tied their horses to\r\nsaplings near the camp and walked down to the rocks. Manns was sent\r\nto McGuire's shanty at the crossing place for a bottle of Old Tom, a\r\nloaf of bread, and some cooked meat. Fordyce took too much gin and\r\nwent to sleep, and Gardiner shook him roughly and told him that if he\r\ndidn't wake up he'd \"cut his---- rations short.\" Later Gardiner sent\r\nCharters to see if the horses were all right, and told him to stop\r\nat the camp and mind them, adding \"You're no---- good here. You're\r\ntoo---- frightened of your skin.\" Soon afterwards he heard firing and\r\nabout an hour later the bushrangers came up leading the coach horses.\r\nThey had packed the gold on these horses. They wiped out and reloaded\r\ntheir guns, and in doing so it was found that Fordyce's gun had not\r\nbeen discharged. Gardiner turned on the young man fiercely and said,\r\n\"You---- coward, you were too much afraid to fire,---- you. I'll cut\r\nyour---- rations short for this.\" They saddled up their horses and\r\nstarted across the ranges.\r\n\r\nThe escort was under the command of Sergeant Condell. It left Forbes\r\nabout noon, Constable John Fagan driving. The other constables were\r\nHenry Moran and William Haviland. When they came to the Eugowra Rocks,\r\nnear the crossing over Mandagery Creek, they found two bullock teams\r\nso placed across the road, which bends sharply as it approaches the\r\nford, that the escort cart had to be driven close to the rocks. The\r\nteams belonged to two bullock drivers who had been made prisoners, and\r\nhad evidently been there for some time, as the bullocks were lying\r\ndown chewing the cud. To pass these teams the coach had to approach\r\nthe rocks at an angle, and as it was passing a volley was fired and\r\nConstable Moran fell. The horses, frightened at the noise and flash\r\nof the guns, bolted, but the cart was overturned through the wheels\r\ncolliding with a spur of the rocks. This threw the other constables\r\nout and prevented them from making any effective resistance. As the\r\ncart capsized, seven armed men, dressed in red shirts and with their\r\nfaces blackened, sprang from behind the rocks shouting, \"Shoot the----\r\nwretches.\" The police fired their carbines and then surrendered. The\r\nrobbers having re-packed their plunder were led by Charters to the\r\nplace from whence they had started, near the Pinnacle, where the gold\r\nand money was roughly divided, and the party separated.\r\n\r\nConstable Moran had sufficiently recovered from his wound to be present\r\nat the trial and to give his evidence. The first jury disagreed and was\r\ndischarged, but at the second trial on February 23rd, 1863, Fordyce,\r\nBow, and Manns were convicted and sentenced to death. Charters was\r\nacquitted according to promise, and McGuire was also acquitted on the\r\ncharge of being concerned in the robbery, but was afterwards convicted\r\nof aiding and abetting the bushrangers, and was sentenced to a term of\r\nimprisonment. Subsequently the capital sentences on Fordyce and Bow\r\nwere commuted to imprisonment for life, and only Manns was hung. The\r\nexecution was terribly bungled. The rope was too short for a tall,\r\nslim youth like Manns, and he struggled violently. Seeing no prospect\r\nof death within a reasonable time. Dr. West instructed the hangman to\r\nraise the body and let it drop again, and this proved effectual. The\r\nprolonged sufferings of the criminal must, however, have been very\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of this daring robbery the \"Gardiner gang of bushrangers\"\r\nwas the principal topic of conversation in New South Wales. After a\r\nlull of several years a new era of bushranging had started, and it\r\nlasted altogether for about ten years before it was finally suppressed.\r\nFor some time the robberies which were reported almost every day were\r\nall attributed to Frank Gardiner, but, as was subsequently proved,\r\nunjustly. Gardiner had made his _coup_ and retired, but it was some\r\ntime before either the police or the public became aware of this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  Johnny Gilbert; His First Appearance in Australia; Miscellaneous\r\n  Bushranging Exploits; Mr. Robert Lowe Makes a Stand; Mr. Inspector\r\n  Norton Captured by the Bushrangers; A Plucky Black Boy; \"Mine know\r\n  it, Patsy Daly like it, Brudder;\" A Brave Boy; O'Meally Shoots Mr.\r\n  Barnes; A Bootless Bushranger; Capture of John Foley; Something about\r\n  the Foley Family; Ben Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to Frank Gardiner, the man most frequently spoken of in connection\r\nwith bushranging at this time was Johnny Gilbert, alias Roberts. He\r\nwas one of the gang charged with assisting in the robbery of the gold\r\nescort at Eugowra Rocks, but who had not been captured. He was born in\r\nCanada, and emigrated with his uncle, John Davis, to Victoria, shortly\r\nafter the discovery of gold there. Davis, it appears, soon became\r\ntired of gold digging, and went to Sydney, where he opened an hotel at\r\nWaverley. On April 6th, 1854, he was found dead in his private room,\r\nand his nephew, then known as Roberts, about seventeen years of age,\r\nwas arrested and charged with the murder. He was acquitted and left\r\nSydney. He was arrested in the Goulburn district, some time later,\r\ncharged with horse-stealing, and sent to gaol. He is supposed to have\r\nmade acquaintance with Gardiner during their imprisonment on Cockatoo\r\nIsland. Roberts made an attempt to escape from the island, but was\r\nrecaptured and was punished by Captain McLerie, the visiting justice.\r\nWhen liberated, after having served his sentence, he disappeared for\r\na time, and was next heard of in connection with the escort robbery.\r\nIt soon became evident to all thinking persons, that there were more\r\nbushrangers abroad than those connected with \"the Gardiner gang.\"\r\nRobberies were reported almost every day, and over a wider range\r\nof country than it was possible for one gang to travel over. These\r\nrobberies were of the most varied character.\r\n\r\nOne day Henry Stephens, innkeeper, near Caloola, was in his bar when\r\nthree men walked in and called for brandy. He served them. When they\r\nhad drunk their liquors they went into the breakfast room and sat\r\ndown. There were present at the table Mr. and Mrs. Stephens, Mr.\r\nYoung, and the three strangers. While the meal was progressing one\r\nof the strangers went out. He returned almost immediately, pistol\r\nin hand, driving the man servant in before him. Mr. Stephens jumped\r\nup, exclaiming \"Hullo, what's up now?\" when the bushranger fired\r\nand shot him in the mouth. The other two visitors rose, and ordered\r\nMrs. Stephens to \"hand out the cash.\" As she refused they searched\r\neverywhere, breaking open boxes, smashing the furniture, and even\r\nrefusing to allow the poor woman to lift her baby from its overturned\r\ncradle, under which it was in danger of being smothered. They took\r\naway about £20 in cash, and a few small articles. As soon as they left\r\nMr. Stephens was conveyed to the hospital at Bathurst for surgical\r\ntreatment. Of course this outrage was attributed to \"Gardiner's gang,\"\r\nbut it was subsequently proved that the robbers had no connection with\r\nthe ex-butcher.\r\n\r\nOn December 10th, 1862, Charles Foley and John Brownlow robbed Daniel\r\nO'Brien's inn at Laggan. Another man stood on guard at the door. They\r\ntied Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien, and put a bag over O'Brien's head to prevent\r\nhim from calling out. Foley searched the place, but only succeeded\r\nin finding \"ten bob.\" Mrs. O'Brien, hoping to induce them to leave\r\nquietly, offered to give them £4 10s. which she had in her pocket, but\r\nFoley said \"We want more than that.\" They ransacked the place, and at\r\nlast found a roll of about fifty £1 notes which Mr. O'Brien had thrown\r\namong some empty casks in a back room on seeing them approaching the\r\nplace. As they were well-known in the district they were soon arrested,\r\nand on February 9th, 1863, were sentenced to seven years' penal\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nAt the same Sessions, Alexander and Charles Ross and William O'Connor\r\nwere convicted of the attack on Mr. Stephens. They had also robbed Mr.\r\nWilliam Webb's store at Fish River, and committed some other outrages.\r\nThey were condemned to death and were hung in March, 1863.\r\n\r\nGeorge Willison and Frederick Britton stuck up the Hartley mail near\r\nthe Woodside Inn, about five miles from Bathurst, on November 16th,\r\n1862. The driver, Owen Malone, and a passenger, Arundell Everett, were\r\ntaken off the road, their hands tied behind them, and they were laid on\r\nthe ground on their faces while the robbers searched the letters. While\r\nthus lying side by side, Everett whispered to his companion, \"Let's\r\nmake a rush.\" Malone however prudently declined, saying, \"What could we\r\ndo with our hands tied behind us? We'd only get shot.\" The robbers took\r\nabout £1500 in notes from the letters and immediately mounted and rode\r\ninto Bathurst to exchange them. They were too late, however. News of\r\nthe robbery had reached the town, and they were arrested in the Union\r\nBank while cashing the notes. They were sentenced to sixteen years'\r\npenal servitude, the first three years in irons. A companion who had\r\nkept watch while the mail was being robbed escaped.\r\n\r\nThe mail coach was stuck up near Mount Victoria by Charles and James\r\nMackay and George Williams. There was nothing remarkable about the\r\nrobbery, but the bushrangers were closely followed and were captured in\r\na few days. The two brothers Mackay were sentenced to fifteen years'\r\nand Williams to ten years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nOn January 7th, 1863, the _Yass Courier_ announced that during the week\r\nthe Binalong mail had been again robbed, and Woodward, the driver, left\r\nbound to a tree. He begged hard not to be left to perish miserably\r\nthrough thirst, but the robbers laughed and rode away. He was released\r\nby a shepherd who happened to hear him cooeying. He was much exhausted.\r\nThe robbers took £24 10s. and a pennyweight nugget. On the same day\r\nSamuel William Jacobsen, hawker, was stuck up near the Wedden Mountains\r\nby John Healy, who ordered him to \"bail up and be quick about it unless\r\nyou want your---- brains blown out.\" Jacobsen and his assistant, Henry\r\nClok, were stripped and told to remain where they were for an hour\r\nunder penalty of death. Their clothes were given back to them after\r\nhaving been searched. They dressed, and when they judged that the time\r\nallowed them had expired--their watches had been taken away with other\r\nproperty--they walked on. They followed the track of their waggon and\r\ncame up to it about three miles away. The horses had been turned loose\r\nand were feeding near. All the drawers and boxes in the waggon had been\r\nbroken open and ransacked, and everything of value had been stolen.\r\n\r\nDuring the week ending April 22nd, 1863, a large number of people were\r\nstuck up and robbed on the road between Marengo and Burrangong. One of\r\nthem, William Oakes, a store-keeper, was going on his usual round among\r\nthe Fish River farms to purchase fowls, eggs, butter, and other produce\r\nfor his store. He was successful in hiding his money, but the robbers\r\nemptied his horse feed out on the ground, ripped open the saddles and\r\ncollars of his horses, and broke all the boxes in the cart in their\r\nattempts to find it.\r\n\r\nOn January 14th a woman was stopped at the Cherry Tree Hill, and asked\r\nfor her money. She refused to give it up. The robbers tried to search\r\nher, but, being unable to find her pocket, they tore the skirt off,\r\nand, in spite of her cries, carried it away, leaving her to get home\r\nwithout it. They got about £3 in notes and silver. These fellows stuck\r\nup the Mudgee mail about an hour later. There were two passengers on\r\nboard, a man and a woman. The man refused to give up his money, when\r\none of the bushrangers said, \"If you don't hand it out we'll strip\r\nthe---- woman.\" As he hesitated the ruffian began to tear off her\r\nclothes. The man yielded. It is satisfactory to know that the amount\r\nobtained was small.\r\n\r\nOn April 3rd the Cassilis mail was stuck up at Reedy Creek, near\r\nMudgee, by two armed men. One of them remarked, after the letters had\r\nbeen gone through, \"This mail never has nothing in it.\" Mr. Farrell,\r\nschoolmaster at Cassilis, who was riding beside the coach when it was\r\nstopped, was robbed of his gold watch and some money. He was also\r\nforced to exchange his horse, saddle, and bridle, for a knocked up\r\nhorse and a very dilapidated saddle and bridle. On the following day\r\nMr. Robert Lowe was driving in a buggy from Talbragar to Mudgee in\r\ncompany with Hugh McKenzie, who was on horseback, when two armed men\r\nordered them to \"bail up.\" Mr. Lowe snatched his gun from the bottom\r\nof the buggy, and fired. The bushrangers wheeled round and rode away,\r\nbut had not gone far when one of them threw up his arms and fell. Lowe\r\nand McKenzie went over to him with the intention of taking him to the\r\nnearest town for treatment, but he died almost immediately. The two\r\ngentlemen then continued their journey to Slapdash, where they gave\r\ninformation to the police and were informed that Messrs. A. Brown,\r\nJ.P., and Alexander Dean had just reported that they had been robbed\r\nnear the same place by two men, one of whom was riding Mr. Farrell's\r\nhorse. Sergeant Cleary and a trooper with two black trackers, Tommy and\r\nJohnny Bein Bar, followed the other bushranger for 260 miles and caught\r\nhim near Coonamble. He was brought to Mudgee, tried and convicted,\r\nand sent to gaol for ten years. At the inquest on the man Heather a\r\nverdict of justifiable homicide was returned, and Mr. Lowe was highly\r\ncomplimented for his prompt action. He was afterwards awarded a gold\r\nmedal by the New South Wales Government for his bravery in resisting\r\nbushrangers.\r\n\r\nOne day Master Willie Cadell was sent by his mother on a message\r\na short distance away from Mudgee. He walked his pony up the hill\r\noutside the township, and was about to start in a canter when a mounted\r\nman dashed in front and shouted \"Stop.\" The pony was frightened by\r\nthe shout and bolted for a short distance, the bushranger galloping\r\nalongside threatening the boy with instant death if he did not pull up.\r\nAt length the pony was brought under control, when the robber said,\r\n\"I don't want to hurt you, but you must come with me.\" He led the boy\r\nto a clump of trees where Mr. Smith, of Appletree Flat, and two other\r\nmen were lying tied on the ground. The bushranger told Willie that he\r\nwould not tie him if he promised not to run away, adding, \"If you break\r\nyour word I'll put a bullet through you.\" The boy promised and went\r\nand sat down on a fallen tree. The bushranger took Willie's pony \"to\r\nspare\" his own horse. As he walked past Mr. Smith, he gave the tied\r\nman a kick, and said roughly, \"You stopped me robbing the mail before,\r\nbut I'll keep you quiet this time.\" He mounted the pony and went back\r\nto the road. Presently he returned with two other men whom he tied and\r\nrobbed. He fired several shots from his revolver at a mark on a tree,\r\n\"for practice\" as he told Willie Cadell. Then he went back to the road\r\nagain. He soon returned with two more men, who were treated as the\r\nothers had been. There were now seven men and a boy held prisoners\r\nunder the clump of trees by one man. The robber had also stopped Mr.\r\nRobinson, with two stock-riders, and had ordered them to round up the\r\nmob of fat cattle they were driving and remain on the flat until after\r\nthe mail passed. Occasionally he would say to his prisoners: \"The mail\r\nwill soon be here now; then you can all go.\" He kept continually riding\r\nfrom the road to where his prisoners were and back. About half-an-hour\r\nafter capturing his last two prisoners the mail coach turned off the\r\nroad and came into the clump of timber, the bushranger riding behind\r\nand directing the driver where to go. There were four male and two\r\nfemale passengers. The women were told to go under a tree, and to \"sit\r\ndown and be quiet.\" The men were searched and tied. Then the bushranger\r\ncoolly sat down and went through the letters. When he had finished he\r\nmounted the pony, and took the bridle of his own horse in his hand.\r\n\"Youngster,\" he said to Willie Cadell, \"you'll find your pony by the\r\nroad.\" He then rode away. Young Cadell, who had replied \"All right,\"\r\nbegan to untie the prisoners as soon as the robber was outside the\r\nclump. When all were loosed they walked out to the road. The pony was\r\nhitched to a tree and the robber seated on his own horse was waiting a\r\nshort distance away. He asked them whether they were all right, and on\r\nbeing answered in the affirmative, raised his hat politely, said, \"Good\r\nevening, ladies and gentlemen,\" and cantered away. The mail-man stopped\r\nto gather up the torn and scattered letters, while Messrs. Smith\r\nand Martin walked to Mudgee to inform the police, and Willie Cadell\r\ncantered away to perform the errand on which his mother had sent him.\r\n\r\nThe coolness with which this robber had acted throughout induced the\r\nbelief among the public that he was no common amateur bushranger, but\r\na member of the Gardiner gang. In fact it was said that he was no\r\nother than Johnny Gilbert himself. The _Goulburn Chronicle_ reported\r\nabout this time that Gardiner and his gang had paid a visit to the\r\nMuswellbrook district, and suggested that one of them had committed\r\nthis robbery on the way back to their own district. This, however,\r\nwas disproved later, and it was then believed that the robber was\r\none of the numerous young men who \"turned out\" with the intention of\r\njoining the gang and endeavoured to do something on the road to prove\r\nthemselves worthy of being accepted as comrades by the redoubtable\r\nbushrangers. It was the custom of the time to attribute all highway\r\nrobberies to Gardiner and his gang, but it is doubtful whether any\r\nof those recorded in this chapter so far were perpetrated by actual\r\nmembers of the gang. It was a time of intense excitement, and many of\r\nthe more or less criminally disposed among the youth of the colony\r\nfelt themselves impelled to take to the road and rob somebody. Some of\r\nthese were captured; others were disillusionised and went back to their\r\nfarms; while others either did join the gang or continued bushranging\r\nas independent parties. The next story, published a few days later, was\r\nthat of the sticking up of the Mudgee mail on the Bathurst-Sydney Road,\r\nnear the Big Hill, about sixteen miles from Bowenfels. Mr. Henry Edward\r\nKater, manager of the local branch of the Australian Joint Stock Bank,\r\nwas a passenger, and he had with him £5000 worth of old notes, which he\r\nwas taking to Sydney to be destroyed at the head office of the bank.\r\nThe bushrangers had received notice from some source that these notes\r\nwere on the coach, and asked for them. Mr. Kater replied that they were\r\nvalueless, as the numbers had been cancelled. \"Never mind,\" replied\r\nthe bushranger. \"We can make a bonfire of them as well as you can.\"\r\nMr. Kater declined to give them up, and stooped down. The bushranger\r\nimmediately ordered him to \"sit up straight and not try to come Robert\r\nLowe on them,\" or he would be sorry for it. This, of course, was an\r\nallusion to the recent shooting of the man Heather by Mr. Lowe, as\r\nalready related. Mrs. Smith, wife of a publican at Ben Bullen, who was\r\na passenger on the coach, was very much alarmed. She was seated beside\r\nMr. Kater, and screamed loudly. She had £200 in her pocket. The robber\r\ntold her to get down and stand aside, adding, \"We don't rob women.\" She\r\nwas only too glad to obey. She sat down on a log beside the road. The\r\nother passengers were then ordered to dismount, and were eased of their\r\nvaluables. When this duty had been discharged the robbers departed,\r\none of them turning back to request Mr. Kater to ask Captain Norton\r\nwhether \"his spurs were getting rusty.\" The robbers were well-dressed\r\nand splendidly mounted. No doubt was entertained anywhere that they\r\nbelonged to Gardiner's gang. A reward of £500 was offered by the Joint\r\nStock Bank for the recovery of the cancelled notes.\r\n\r\nIn recording the principal robberies committed at this time by\r\nbushrangers who were not known certainly to belong to the gang, I have\r\nnecessarily omitted to mention the robberies effected by the gang\r\nitself. It is now, therefore, time to return to the beginning of the\r\nyear and take up the history of the gang itself. On New Year's Day,\r\n1863, races were being held at Brisbane Valley on the Fish River,\r\nwhen Frederick Lowry and John Foley made a daring attempt to stick up\r\nthe crowd, numbering more than one hundred persons. A man named Foran\r\nrefused to be tied when called on to come out and was immediately shot\r\nby Lowry. Although he was wounded in the lungs Foran rushed forward\r\nand grappled with Lowry. Several other men came to his assistance, and\r\nLowry was overpowered, while Foley, who had been engaged in tying the\r\nmen, jumped on his horse and got away. Lowry was locked up in a room\r\nbehind the bar of the publican's booth, but the booth was a mere shell,\r\nand he contrived to escape before the police came.\r\n\r\nOn February 27th Mr. Cirkel, publican at Stony Creek, Burrangong, was\r\ncalled out of his house and shot dead, after having been accused of\r\nhaving given information to the police. It was said that the men who\r\ncommitted this crime were Gardiner, Gilbert, O'Meally, and another\r\nwhose name was not known. O'Meally was said to have fired the fatal\r\nshot. The party of bushrangers rode on to Mr. Myers Solomon's store\r\nat the \"Big Wombat.\" Mr. Solomon, seeing them coming, attempted to run\r\naway, but was followed and brought back. A lad in the store vaulted\r\nover the counter and snatched a pistol from the belt of one of the\r\nbushrangers while the dispute was going on as to whether Solomon should\r\nbe shot for attempting to \"betray\" them to the police. Another of the\r\nbushrangers immediately put his pistol to Mrs. Solomon's head and said\r\nto the boy, \"If you fire I'll blow her brains out.\" The boy looked\r\nundecided. The bushranger cocked his pistol and swore that if the boy\r\ndid not return the weapon he had taken the woman should die. The boy\r\nthen stepped forward, laid the revolver on the counter, and said,\r\n\"If it wasn't for Mrs. Solomon I'd stop your---- run anyhow.\" He was\r\nimmediately knocked down and kicked.\r\n\r\nThe _Lachlan Observer_ of March 5th reported that Mr. Inspector Norton,\r\nwho had recently relieved Sir Frederick Pottinger as head of the police\r\nforce in the district, had been captured by the bushrangers. Captain\r\nNorton had been in pursuit of the robbers, and was returning from a\r\nlong ride through the ranges, accompanied only by a black tracker known\r\nas Billy Durgan. On Sunday, 1st instant, he came suddenly on a camp\r\nsome three or four miles from Wheogo. Billy, who was riding behind\r\nleading a spare horse, saw the fire first, and shouted \"Here they\r\nare.\" Three of the bushrangers sprang up, mounted their horses, and\r\ncame towards the officer. Billy advised him to \"bolt,\" but the captain\r\nshook his head and replied \"No good, Billy. Horse too much knock up.\"\r\n\"Mine stop it too,\" said Billy. O'Meally and Patrick Daly fired as they\r\napproached, and Norton returned the fire until his revolver was empty,\r\nwhen he said \"I surrender.\" Daly cried \"Throw down your arms,\" and as\r\nNorton threw away his revolver another man galloped up and fired at\r\nhim. At that moment Billy, the black boy, seeing the danger Norton was\r\nin, gave a yell, jumped off his horse, and threw his empty pistol in\r\nthe bushranger's face. By this plucky act Billy no doubt saved Captain\r\nNorton's life, but the bushranger turned and fired at the black. Billy,\r\nhowever, kicked off his boots, sprang behind a tree, and shouted \"Come\r\non, you----.\" O'Meally replied, \"We'll wallop you, you young----,\r\nwhen we catch you.\" At which threat Billy laughed, and replied \"You\r\ncatchem first.\" Daly and the other bushranger chased him, but Billy\r\ndodged about from tree to tree with all the agility of the black,\r\npelting sticks at them, and laughingly telling them to \"come on.\"\r\nThe bushrangers fired at him several times, but with no effect, and\r\nat length gave up the chase and returned to where O'Meally was still\r\nguarding Captain Norton. After a consultation aside the bushrangers\r\ntold the captain that they had mistaken him for Trooper Holliston. They\r\nintended to \"do for\" the trooper the first time they caught him. They\r\ndetained the captain for about three hours, treating him very civilly,\r\nand then released him.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Daly was arrested by Sir Frederick Pottinger. He\r\nwas a native of the district, under twenty years of age. When brought\r\nup and charged at the police court, Captain Norton failed to identify\r\nhim, but Billy Durgan exclaimed, when called upon for his evidence:\r\n\"Mine know it, Patsy Daly like it brudder.\" Daly was placed on trial\r\nfor having, in company with others, robbed Myers Solomon, store-keeper,\r\nof property, including money, horses, guns, revolvers, clothing, food,\r\n&c., to a large amount. George Johnson identified Daly as the man who\r\nhad knocked the boy down and kicked him when he placed the revolver\r\non the counter. Johnson called Daly a coward, and was told to keep\r\nquiet unless he wanted his \"---- brains blown out.\" Johnson replied:\r\n\"I'd like to meet you man to man fairly.\" Another of the bushrangers\r\nasked: \"Will you stand up and fight me if I give you a pistol?\" Johnson\r\nreplied, \"Yes,\" and stepped forward. The third bushranger, however,\r\nordered him back, and told his mates to \"quit fooling.\" Johnson and\r\nthe other men in the store were then made to lie on their faces, with\r\na bushranger over them on guard, while the other bushrangers selected\r\nwhat they wanted, packed it in bundles, and strapped it on the pack\r\nhorses. While thus employed, the bushranger who had challenged Johnson\r\nkicked him in the ribs savagely, and told him to keep still. The\r\nother persons present gave their versions of the occurrence, but they\r\ndiffered little from what has been recorded above. Daly was convicted,\r\nand was sentenced to fifteen years' penal servitude.\r\n\r\nOn March 30th, two men called at James Brown's hut at Wallenbeen\r\nand asked for something to eat. Brown told his wife to give them\r\nsome breakfast. It may be necessary to remark that such hospitality\r\nis common in Australia. Having eaten as much as they required, the\r\ntravellers demanded Brown's hat and boots. After some dispute these\r\nwere handed over. The boots were too small, and the man who wanted\r\nthem took out his pocket-knife to cut them, when his mate said, \"Oh,\r\ncome on; we'll get plenty at McKay's.\" They left the boots, went\r\nout, mounted their horses, and rode away. They had only gone a few\r\nyards when they met Mr. Barnes, a store-keeper at Cootamundra, and\r\nhis assistant, Mr. Hanlow, who was in charge of a branch store at\r\nMurrumburrah. The travellers ordered Barnes to \"bail up.\" Barnes said,\r\n\"I know you, O'Meally,\" and O'Meally replied, \"I know you, you----.\r\nGet off that horse; I want him.\" Barnes wheeled his horse round and\r\ngalloped away, and O'Meally followed. They galloped round the hill,\r\nback past the stockyard, and then down the gully out of sight among the\r\ntrees. In the meantime, Hanlow was conducted by the other bushranger\r\noff the road to the stockyard, where they were soon joined by O'Meally.\r\n\"Where's Mr. Barnes?\" asked Hanlow, as the robber rode up. \"Down\r\nthere,\" replied O'Meally nonchalantly, pointing down the gully. \"You\r\nhaven't shot him?\" inquired Hanlow anxiously. \"Oh, no,\" replied the\r\nbushranger coolly, \"he hit himself against a tree and tumbled off.\" Mr.\r\nAlexander McKay, the squatter who owned the stockyard, and whose house\r\nwas not far away, had heard the galloping and shouting, and went on to\r\nthe verandah of his house to ascertain the cause of the noise. It was\r\nthen about half-past eleven a.m., and the day was Sunday. He saw one\r\nman chasing another, and thought it was a trooper after a bushranger.\r\nHe watched them gallop down the gully, and saw the one he took to be\r\na trooper shoot the other, and then wheel his horse round and gallop\r\nback without waiting to see whether the man who had fallen off his\r\nhorse was dead or not. As O'Meally came nearer McKay recognised him,\r\nand his suspicions were aroused. He started to walk down the gully to\r\nthe wounded man, when he was stopped by O'Meally who ordered him to\r\ngo back and open the store, adding, \"I want some boots and clothes for\r\nmy mate. He lost his in a brush with the traps.\" Mr. McKay went to the\r\nstore and gave O'Meally the things he had asked for. The bushranger\r\nthen said he wanted fresh horses. McKay replied that the horses were\r\nnever brought in on a Sunday and therefore he could not get them.\r\n\"Ah,\" said O'Meally, \"I had Chance from you. He was a good 'un. Well,\r\nI'll come some other time and get one.\" The bushrangers then went away\r\nand McKay and Hanlow walked down the gully to where Barnes was lying.\r\nThey found that he was quite dead, and sent word to the nearest police\r\nstation. An inquest was held next day, and a verdict of wilful murder\r\nwas returned against O'Meally and another man whose name was unknown.\r\n\r\nA day or two later Mr. Frank was riding from Lambing Flat (Burrangong)\r\nto Yass, when he was stopped by seven men whose faces were hidden by\r\nblack crape veils. They ordered him to \"shell out.\" \"I've only thirty\r\nbob, boys,\" he replied. One of the robbers said \"Oh, keep it. You'll\r\nwant that to take you home again.\" Some of the others said that they\r\nknew him and he wasn't \"a bad sort,\" so he could go. They asked him if\r\nhe had seen any police on the road, and added that they wished to \"meet\r\nthe---- traps.\" After several minutes spent in conversation they rode\r\noff and Mr. Frank continued his journey.\r\n\r\nShortly after this Constables McDonald, Lee, and Nicholls traced John\r\nFoley to Mackay's Hotel, Campbell's River, with the aid of a black\r\ntracker. McDonald pushed the door of the bedroom in which he was told\r\nFoley had been sleeping, but the man inside leaned heavily against\r\nit to prevent it from being opened. After a struggle McDonald forced\r\nhis revolver through the opening and fired round the corner. He did\r\nnot hit the man inside, but the shot forced him to give way a little.\r\nThe constable said, \"Come along, Foley. We've got you. You can't\r\nget away.\" After a moment's pause Foley replied, \"All right. Don't\r\nshoot.\" He stepped back and the door swung open. The police rushed in\r\nand handcuffed him. He was taken to Bathurst, where he was charged\r\nwith having looted Mrs. Anne Webb's store at Mutton Falls, and with\r\nhaving aided and abetted other bushrangers in several robberies on\r\nthe highway and elsewhere. During the trial it was noticed that Mrs.\r\nFoley, the prisoner's mother, was passing in and out of the court and\r\ncommunicating with the witnesses who had been ordered out of court.\r\nShe was cautioned, but as she persisted in spite of the efforts of the\r\npolice, she was ordered to be locked up for contempt of court. Timothy\r\nFoley, a brother of the accused, was also committed for contempt of\r\ncourt, and was threatened with prosecution for perjury for his attempts\r\nto prove an alibi. The prisoner was convicted and was sentenced to\r\nfifteen years' imprisonment, the first three years in irons. Another\r\nbrother, Francis Foley, was sentenced at the same sessions to ten\r\nyears' imprisonment for having raided the Chinese Camp at Campbell's\r\nRiver. Henry Gibson was also arraigned for bushranging. He admitted\r\nthat he had been overseer on Ben Hall's station, but denied that he\r\nhad ever joined Gardiner's gang. He was acquitted by the jury, and the\r\nverdict was received with some applause. As soon as order had been\r\nrestored, the judge remarked that it would perhaps add to the general\r\nsatisfaction if he informed the court that the prisoner would not go\r\nfree in spite of his acquittal. He had before him a document which\r\nproved that the prisoner was an escaped convict from Victoria, and\r\nwould therefore be detained until he could be returned to that colony\r\nto finish his sentence.\r\n\r\nHitherto the gang had continued to be known as \"Gardiner's Gang,\"\r\nalthough it had been repeatedly asserted in the press that Gardiner\r\nhad taken no share in the later robberies, and that in fact he had\r\nretired from \"the profession\" several months ago. It was said that\r\nnotwithstanding the vigilance of the police, Gardiner had succeeded\r\nin escaping from New South Wales, taking with him the wife of a\r\nrespectable farmer in the Burrangong district named Brown. The reports,\r\nhowever, were very contradictory. Sometimes it was said that he had\r\ngone to New Zealand. Then that he had made his way to California or to\r\nSouth America. In the meantime the gang continued to be as active as\r\never under the leadership of Johnny Gilbert and Ben Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  Racers as Mounts for the Bushrangers; The Shooting of Lowry; The ----\r\n  Bushrangers visit Bathurst; They hold the Town of Canowindra for\r\n  Three Days; Burke Shot by Mr. Keightley; Female Bushrangers; Death of\r\n  O'Meally at Goimbla; A Newspaper Man and his Wife Stuck Up; Lively\r\n  Times During the Christmas Holidays.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief necessity for a successful career as a bushranger was a\r\ngood supply of racehorses, and hence it was almost impossible for any\r\nperson to keep a really valuable saddle horse during this \"Reign of\r\nTerror,\" as the newspapers of the district called it. Special raids\r\nwere organised by members of the gang to obtain a supply of horses,\r\nand the bushrangers frequently travelled upwards of two hundred miles\r\nto secure a horse which had made a name on the turf. Thus on May\r\n18th Harry Wilson, trainer for Mr. Allen Hancock, was exercising the\r\nracer Jacky Morgan, within sight of the police station in the town of\r\nBurrowa, when Gilbert rode up and said \"I want that horse.\" \"For God's\r\nsake don't ruin me, Johnny,\" exclaimed the jockey. \"Hold your---- jaw\r\nand get off,\" was the reply, as the bushranger brought out his ready\r\nrevolver. The robber specially cautioned Wilson not to \"sing out\" so\r\nthat the police could hear, or he'd \"be sorry for it,\" and in spite of\r\nhis remonstrances the jockey was compelled to dismount and walk home to\r\ninform his employer. Mr. Hancock told him to saddle another horse. He\r\nthen took down his gun carefully, wiped and loaded it, and went away\r\nswearing that he would never return until he had recovered Jacky Morgan.\r\n\r\nGilbert also took a racer out of Mr. Hammond's stables at Junee. He\r\nstole the racers Chinaman and Micky Hunter from the stables of Mr.\r\nJ. Roberts at Currawang. When leading Micky Hunter out of his stall\r\nGilbert patted his neck and said, \"You're the---- cove we want.\" Old\r\nComus and several other horses were taken out of Mr. Iceley's stables\r\nat Coombing. The old horse had had a good career on the course, and\r\nhad been set apart for stud purposes, and Mr. Iceley offered a large\r\nsum to the bushrangers to leave him alone, but Gilbert said, \"There's\r\na good gallop in him yet,\" and led him away. But the bushrangers did\r\nnot devote their whole time to capturing race horses. Robberies on\r\nthe highway continued as frequently as usual. The police, however,\r\nwere not idle. In August, Sergeant James Stephenson, Constable Herbst,\r\nand Detectives Camphin and Saunderson traced Lowry to Thomas Vardy's,\r\nLimerick Races Hotel, at Cook's Vale Creek. When asked if there were\r\nany lodgers there, Vardy pointed to the door of one of the bedrooms\r\nand replied, \"Yes, one there.\" Stephenson knocked at the door, but\r\nthere was no reply. The sergeant knocked again and called out \"Come out\r\nLowry, it's no use.\" As no answer was returned, the sergeant placed\r\nhis shoulder against the door, and tried to burst it open. Immediately\r\nsome one inside fired a pistol, the bullet from which passed through\r\nthe panel of the door between the two policemen. Stephenson again\r\ncalled on Lowry to come out or it would be \"the worse for him,\" and\r\nthe bushranger replied \"I'll fight you, you----. All of you.\" He again\r\nfired through the door, and the bullet wounded one of the police\r\nhorses tied to the verandah. Sergeant Stephenson called on Vardy to\r\ntake the horses to a safe place, and when they were out of sight, he\r\nand Constable Herbst again tried to force the door by leaning their\r\ncombined weight against it. Suddenly Lowry threw the door open, and the\r\nsergeant almost fell into the room. The bushranger shouted \"Come on,\r\nyou---- I'll fight you fair,\" and fired. The police returned the fire.\r\nStephenson, who was inside the room, took steady aim and pulled the\r\ntrigger. The robber fell, saying \"I'm done for! Where's the priest?\"\r\nThe police arrested Vardy and all his family, as well as a man named\r\nLarry Cummins, who was in the room with Lowry, but who took no part\r\nin the fight. When this ceremony had been completed, Lowry was made\r\nas comfortable as circumstances permitted while a messenger was sent\r\noff to the nearest town for a doctor. For more than an hour detective\r\nCamphin sat by Lowry's side reading prayers from a Catholic prayer-book\r\nwhich Mrs. Vardy lent him. The robber gradually grew weaker and died.\r\nHis last words were, \"Tell 'em I died game.\" The police borrowed a\r\ncart from a farmer who lived about a mile away from the hotel, and the\r\nbody was placed in it, covered with a blanket, and started away for\r\nGoulburn, where this extraordinary funeral cortège arrived the next\r\nday, Sunday, just as the people were leaving the churches.\r\n\r\nFrederick Lowry was a native of the district, twenty-seven years of\r\nage, and six feet two inches in height.\r\n\r\nIn the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, on August 18th, 1863,\r\nMr., afterwards Sir James, Martin moved that \"the alarming state of\r\ninsecurity of life and property which has so long prevailed through the\r\ncountry districts is in a high degree discreditable to Her Majesty's\r\nMinisters in this colony.\" Mr., afterwards Sir Charles, Cowper,\r\nspeaking for the Government, said that the police authorities had full\r\npower to take all the troopers that could be spared from the more\r\nthickly-populated districts to the disturbed area. The discussion on\r\nthe motion lasted for a week, when it was negatived by forty-four to\r\neighteen votes. The Government was in fact doing all that it could\r\nreasonably be expected to do to preserve order, and this was generally\r\nrecognised, although the Press continued to urge that more energetic\r\nmeasures should be adopted, and bushranging stamped out at any cost.\r\nThe success of the bushrangers was largely due to the nature of the\r\ncountry, with the features of which they were perfectly familiar. Had\r\nthere been double the number of police in the district it is barely\r\nprobable that the outbreak could have been put down much more quickly\r\nthan it was. The police showed remarkable bravery, but they were unable\r\nto follow the bushrangers into the ranges, with the intricacies of\r\nwhich they were unacquainted. It was not the number of bushrangers, but\r\ntheir activity, boldness, and more than all their intimate knowledge\r\nof the country, which enabled them to keep so extensive an area of the\r\ncolony in a ferment for so long a time.\r\n\r\nThe Carcour mail was stuck up at about a mile outside the town of\r\nBlaney on September 23rd. A passenger named Garland refused to \"hand\r\nout\" when ordered. He was told that if he persisted in his refusal he\r\nwould \"get a good hiding.\" One bushranger stood by his side holding a\r\ngun close to Garland's head, while another bushranger felt his pockets.\r\nThey took out two £1 notes. The coach was then taken up the ridge to\r\nabout 300 yards from the road. Here there was a level spot fairly clear\r\nof timber, and in this little plain were eight men sitting in a ring\r\nwith a robber standing on guard over them. The coach-driver and the\r\ntwo passengers were ordered to take their seats in the ring while the\r\nletters were searched. They obeyed, and were detained more than an\r\nhour. One of the prisoners in the ring was a trooper. When the mail had\r\nbeen gone through the bushrangers, one of whom was riding Mr. Daniel\r\nMayne's horse Retriever, told them they might go. Garland said \"It's\r\nno use going without any money,\" whereupon a bushranger handed him ten\r\nshillings and told him not to growl. It was about five o'clock p.m.\r\nwhen the bushrangers rode off. They were said to be Gilbert, O'Meally,\r\nBurke, and another.\r\n\r\nA few days later Gilbert and O'Meally went to a cattle station some\r\nmiles from Burrangong and rounded up the horses. A stock-rider galloped\r\nup and ordered them to desist. Gilbert told him that they were troopers\r\nand had orders from Her Majesty the Queen to take any horses they\r\nrequired. The stockman then assisted them to catch two of the best.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, October 23rd, Hall, Gilbert, O'Meally, Burke, and Vane\r\nwalked into Mr. Perdrotta's gunsmith's shop in William Street,\r\nBathurst, opposite the School of Arts, and asked to see some revolvers.\r\nThey were shown a number, but said they were common things and no\r\ngood. Mr. Perdrotta said he had sold out. There had been a run on\r\nrevolvers lately on account of the bushrangers, but he expected a new\r\nstock up from Sydney in a few days. The robbers laughed heartily, and\r\nsaid that the bushrangers required to be looked after. They promised\r\nto call again in a few days. They walked up the street to McMinn's\r\nHotel, and went in as the family were sitting down to tea. Miss McMinn\r\nrecognised them and screamed. She was ordered to keep quiet, but as\r\nthis made her scream louder the bushrangers left. The report that the\r\nbushrangers were in the town spread like wild-fire, and the streets\r\nwere crowded with excited people in a few minutes. It was rumoured that\r\nthe bushrangers had robbed Mr. De Clouett, in Piper Street, and that\r\nDe Clouett had recognised Johnny Gilbert as a jockey who had ridden\r\nfor him some years before. The police hastily armed and mounted, when\r\nsuddenly the bushrangers, mounted on their horses, with revolvers in\r\ntheir hands, dashed through the crowd in Howick Street, shouting, \"Two\r\nof us is good for forty---- troopers.\" The crowd scattered to let them\r\npass. The bushrangers rode through the street at a gallop and left the\r\ntown in the direction of the timbered country, avoiding the roads. The\r\npolice followed close behind, but the bushrangers had the faster horses\r\nand got away.\r\n\r\nOn October 17th, Mr. Robinson, of Robinson's Hotel, Canowindra, was\r\nawakened at about 1.30 a.m. by a loud knocking. He went to the door\r\nand asked, \"Who's there?\" The reply was, \"The police.\" Robinson opened\r\nthe door and was immediately ordered to \"bail up.\" The visitors were\r\nHall, Gilbert, and O'Meally, the bushrangers. Mr. Robinson gave them\r\n£3, which he took from a drawer, and said that was all the money he had\r\nin the house. He begged them to go away. They refused, and insisted on\r\nevery one in the house getting up at once. After some delay the family\r\nand Mr. Kieran Cummings, a lodger, were collected in the dining-room.\r\nThe bushrangers took charge and served out drinks all round. When time\r\nfor opening the house came, the bushrangers stationed themselves, one\r\nat each end of the verandah and the third in the bar. They bailed\r\nup fourteen bullock-drivers who were camped near the township, and\r\ncompelled them to leave their teams in the street as they arrived.\r\nThe robbers took anything they required or fancied from the drays and\r\nmarched the drivers into the dining-room of the hotel. During the\r\nmorning, Messrs. Hibberson, Twaddell, and Kirkpatrick drove up to\r\nthe hotel in a buggy. They were compelled to alight and go into the\r\ndining-room. Ben Hall, seeing that Mr. Kirkpatrick carried a revolver,\r\nrequested him to \"oblige by handing that thing over. Not that we want\r\nit, you know; but it might go off by accident.\" Mr. Kirkpatrick\r\nlaughed, and gave him the weapon. Hall examined it carefully and said,\r\n\"We've got better than that. We'll leave it for you at Louden's, at\r\nGrubbenbong, so that you may get it when you pass.\" Mrs. Robinson and\r\nthe cook were released and ordered to get a \"first-class dinner for\r\nthe gentlemen, and we'll pay for it.\" The prisoners were well treated.\r\nFood was brought in at intervals, and bottles of brandy were placed on\r\nthe table for all to help themselves as they pleased. Several boxes of\r\ncigars were ordered, and these were opened and the cigars thrown along\r\nthe table. Robinson had promised not to \"try any hanky panky,\" and was\r\nallowed to go to the bar. Everything ordered was paid for without delay\r\nor dispute. Gilbert walked to the lock-up, called out the solitary\r\npoliceman who was stationed in the town, and made him march down to\r\nthe hotel. Here he was given his musket, and ordered to pace up and\r\ndown before the verandah as if on sentry duty. When they grew tired of\r\nshowing their contempt for \"the force\" in this manner the gun was taken\r\naway and the policeman conducted into the dining-room and placed with\r\nthe other prisoners to \"enjoy himself like the rest.\" The robbers drank\r\nvery little themselves. Occasionally they ordered a bottle of English\r\nbeer, and drew the cork themselves after having examined it carefully\r\nto make sure that it had not been tampered with. On the Wednesday\r\nmorning Mr. Hibberson begged hard to be allowed to go. He said that he\r\nand his friends had enjoyed themselves very much, and would have been\r\nwilling to stay longer to oblige, but the river was beginning to rise,\r\nand if it came down as usual at that time of the year they might not be\r\nable to cross for a month. This would interfere seriously with their\r\nbusiness. The bushrangers listened to this plea, and then withdrew.\r\nAfter a consultation which lasted several minutes, Hall came back, and\r\nsaid they thought it was \"a fair thing.\" They were very much obliged to\r\nthe gentlemen for their contributions towards the general amusement,\r\nand they graciously gave them permission to fetch their horses from\r\nthe stable and start. An hour or so later the other persons in the\r\ndining-room were told that they might go. This spree must have been an\r\nexpensive one. The bushrangers only took a few pounds to start with,\r\nwhile they paid for everything that was consumed by the crowd between\r\n1.30 a.m. on Monday and noon on Wednesday. At first there had been a\r\nfeeling of restraint, caused, perhaps, by fear or uncertainty, but this\r\nsoon wore off, and the party ended by being a very merry one. Several\r\ngames were started. Songs were sung, and one of the bullock-drivers\r\nhad a concertina and played dance music; several of the members of the\r\nparty danced. The women and children were allowed to go to bed, but the\r\nmen had to sleep with their heads on the table. The bushrangers only\r\nslept for short naps in turn. On leaving Canowindra the bushrangers\r\nrode straight to Mr. Grant's place, at Balubula, called him out, and\r\naccused him of having given information to the police as to their\r\nmovements. As a punishment they burned his house, stacks, and standing\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nA week later, on October 24th, Hall, Gilbert, O'Meally, Vane, and Burke\r\nrode up to Assistant Gold Commissioner Keightley's house, at Dunn's\r\nPlains, near Rockley, and called on him to come out. Mr. Keightley had\r\nbeen standing on the verandah, and on seeing them coming had rushed\r\nin and slammed the door. As he did not obey, the bushrangers fired\r\nsome shots at the windows. Keightley returned the fire, and Burke\r\nfell, crying out \"I'm done for.\" There was very little ammunition in\r\nthe house and when this was expended Keightley surrendered. He asked\r\nonly that the women should not be molested. Vane swore he would avenge\r\nBurke by shooting Keightley. Mrs. Baldock, wife of the camp-keeper,\r\nwho was acting as general servant at the time, rushed between the\r\nmen and pushed Vane back, crying at the time, \"Oh! don't shoot him!\r\nRecollect his wife and her little baby.\" Dr. Peechy, who was present,\r\nalso interfered, but was knocked down with the butt of a revolver.\r\nMrs. Baldock again pushed Vane away, saying, \"Don't hurt the doctor.\r\nHe never did you any harm.\" Vane was much excited and swore a great\r\ndeal, but he did not even push the woman away. Presently Hall, who had\r\nbeen some distance away, came up and told Vane to keep cool. He added\r\nthat it was impossible to say in the _mêlée_ who shot Burke. \"Why,\"\r\nhe exclaimed, \"I might have done it myself.\" After a short time order\r\nwas restored, and the doctor then said that Burke was not dead. He\r\noffered to go to Rockley for his instruments and to return immediately.\r\nHall said \"What's the good? Better shoot him and put him out of his\r\nmisery.\" A discussion followed, and at length permission was given\r\nto the doctor to go to his house for his instruments, after he had\r\nsolemnly promised \"not to bring the traps\" on them. After the doctor's\r\ndeparture O'Meally declared his intention of taking Keightley down\r\nthe paddock and shooting him. He told the Gold Commissioner \"to come\r\non,\" but Mrs. Keightley rushed between them and said he should shoot\r\nher before he took her husband away. Hall again interfered and order\r\nwas restored. When the doctor returned he found that Burke was dead. A\r\nlengthy discussion took place as to what should be done with Keightley.\r\nO'Meally and Vane wished to shoot him. Hall and Gilbert were in favour\r\nof holding him to ransom, and Mrs. Keightley undertook to pay them £500\r\nif they would spare his life. Finally an agreement was arrived at. Mrs.\r\nKeightley was to ride to Bathurst and bring back the money by two p.m.\r\nthe next day (Sunday). If she failed to return at that time, or brought\r\nany one back with her, her husband and Doctor Peechy were to be shot.\r\nThe distance from Rockley to Bathurst was twenty-five miles, but Mrs.\r\nKeightley started without misgiving. The bushrangers refused to stop\r\nin the house during the night in case of surprise. They took their\r\nprisoners and camped with them on a knoll, some distance away, from\r\nthe top of which they had a good view of the Bathurst Road for several\r\nmiles. This they declared would give them time to shoot their hostages\r\nand ride away if treachery was attempted. Mrs. Keightley obtained\r\nthe necessary amount of money from her father, Mr. Rolton, M.L.A.,\r\nand returned home an hour before the stipulated time. She handed the\r\nmoney to Ben Hall, who complimented her on her endurance and pluck.\r\nThen Mr. Keightley and Dr. Peechy were told that they were free, and\r\nthe bushrangers mounted and rode off. When this outrage was reported,\r\nthe rewards offered for the capture, dead or alive, of Hall, Gilbert,\r\nO'Meally, and Vane, were increased to £1000, while £100 was offered for\r\nthe capture of any other of their accomplices.\r\n\r\nA bullock-driver left Burrangong, after having disposed of his load\r\nof produce, and camped near the Burrangong Creek, a few miles from the\r\ndiggings, when three men with blackened faces, and further disguised\r\nwith spectacles, called on him. They demanded the £45 which he had\r\nreceived in payment for his load, proving that they had somehow\r\nestablished a very effective system of espionage in the diggings.\r\nHe admitted that that was the sum for which he had sold his load,\r\nbut denied having the money, asserting that he had paid it away.\r\nThey disbelieved him, and searched him and his dray, shaking out his\r\nblankets and tarpaulin. They found about £3 in notes and silver, and\r\nwent off with it. The bullock-driver had been too wide awake for them.\r\nHe had heard them coming along the road, and knowing how the district\r\nwas infested with robbers, had hastily thrust his roll of notes under a\r\nlog near his camp fire.\r\n\r\nPeter Toohey was driving the mail coach on the road between Burrangong\r\nand Cowra, when he was ordered to bail up by three armed men. Instead\r\nof obeying he lashed his horses into a gallop, and did not pull up\r\nuntil he reached Mr. Allen's station at Wattamundera. The bushrangers\r\nfollowed for a mile or more and snapped their revolvers at him, but\r\nthey were either not loaded or missed fire. In recording this event the\r\n_Burrangong Courier_ remarked that this was probably the fastest three\r\nmiles on record for a \"Cobb's coach.\" This, however, is very doubtful.\r\nThe _Courier_ does not give the time, but some very tall tales of\r\ncoach-racing have been given in the Victorian newspapers of the races\r\nrun by opposition coaches on the roads from Melbourne to Bendigo and\r\nfrom Geelong to Ballarat in early diggings days.\r\n\r\nThe same paper reported that Constable Clark chased and captured two\r\nsupposed bushrangers near Marengo on August 30th. When they reached\r\nthe lock-up they were identified as Kate Meally and Elizabeth Mayhew.\r\nThey were detained, but the next morning Sergeant Monaghan asked the\r\nmagistrate to discharge the prisoners, as he had ascertained from\r\nenquiries that the girls only went out \"for a bit of a spree in their\r\nbrothers' clothes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. David Henry Campbell was sitting in his house on the Goimbla sheep\r\nstation on the evening of November 19th when he heard footsteps on\r\nthe verandah. Being suspicious as to the character of the visitors,\r\nhe seized his gun and retreated to an inner room, while his brother\r\nWilliam retired by another door. Mrs. Campbell was in the bedroom.\r\nThe bushrangers came to the front door, and fired into the room. Mr.\r\nCampbell returned the fire, and the bushrangers retreated. They went\r\nto the stackyard, and fired the barn and haystack. They then returned\r\nto the house, which was illuminated by the blazing of the barn and\r\nstack. Mrs. Campbell came out of the bedroom, and spoke a few words to\r\nher husband. Then she crossed the front parlour in full view of the\r\nbushrangers, took a second gun and a powder flask from the corner, and\r\nreturned to her husband. The bushrangers fired at her, but missed,\r\nand they then retreated along the verandah to where the shadow cast\r\nby the blazing stack concealed them. After waiting a few minutes Mrs.\r\nCampbell, thinking, as she could hear no sound except the roaring of\r\nthe flames, that the bushrangers had gone away, stealthily crossed the\r\nfront room and peeped out of the window. She saw three men standing\r\nnear the stackyard, and went back to inform her husband. Mr. Campbell\r\nimmediately left the house by the back door, crept gently along the\r\nfence, taking care to keep in the shadow, and approached the men as\r\nclosely as possible without giving them the alarm. He recognised the\r\nman nearest to him as O'Meally, and fired. O'Meally fell. Almost at the\r\nsame moment the police, having seen the reflection of the fire miles\r\naway, and had ridden over to ascertain its cause, came galloping up.\r\nHall and Gilbert, the two other bushrangers, hastily mounted their\r\nhorses and went off under cover of the darkness. O'Meally's body was\r\nconveyed to Bathurst, where an inquest was held, and a verdict of\r\njustifiable homicide was returned. The _Bathurst Times_ reported that\r\nlocks of O'Meally's hair were being shown about and sold in the town,\r\nand protested against it. The paper said that the authorities had no\r\nright to allow this desecration of the body, even of a bushranger and\r\nmurderer. \"The police,\" it added, \"would not have dared to touch his\r\nhair had he been alive. Probably Pottinger and the army of troopers\r\nthat swarmed round Goimbla when the danger was passed each took a lock\r\nof his hair _in memoriam_ when their enemy lay prostrate and dead.\" A\r\npublic meeting was held in Sydney on March 3rd to consider what means\r\nshould be adopted to recognise the bravery of Mr. Campbell in daring to\r\nresist the bushrangers and shooting O'Meally. A number of prominent men\r\ngave addresses, and it was resolved that a public subscription should\r\nbe taken up to recoup him for the loss of his barn and stacks. The\r\namount collected at the meeting and during a few days after totalled\r\n£1100. Mr. Campbell was also awarded a gold medal by the Government.\r\n\r\nThe violent deaths of Lowry, Burke, and O'Meally, in so short a time,\r\nseemed to have very little effect on the gang, which continued its\r\ndepredations. Neither did these deaths prevent other young men from\r\nadopting the \"profession of bushranger.\" In fact the deaths of a few\r\nbushrangers appear to have had less effect in deterring the criminally\r\ndisposed from taking to the roads than the immunity enjoyed by the\r\nleaders offered encouragement. Bushranging was increasing instead of\r\ndiminishing, although for a few months very little was heard of the\r\nHall and Gilbert Gang. There was also some comedy mingled with the\r\nprevailing tragedy. For instance, a blackfellow met Alexander Sinclair,\r\nnear Killoshiel, and enquired how far it was to Bathurst? Sinclair\r\ntold him, and was immediately ordered to \"get off that horse.\" The\r\nrider hesitated, but the darkey pushed him off the saddle, sprang\r\ninto it himself, and galloped away threatening to shoot Sinclair if\r\nhe followed, although it is very doubtful whether he had any arms on\r\nhim. The same blackfellow took possession of another horse in a similar\r\nmanner a few hours later some miles along the road. He rode both horses\r\nuntil they knocked up, and then abandoned them. They were afterwards\r\nfound feeding in the bush with their saddles and bridles still on. It\r\nwas supposed that the blackfellow was just pining for a gallop and\r\nadopted this means of gratifying himself. He was not traced.\r\n\r\nSergeant Donohoe captured William Dunne after an exciting chase through\r\nthe ranges, and as the sergeant did not know his way back to the high\r\nroad, he compelled his prisoner to lie down and waited patiently until\r\nsome other policemen went out in search of him. Neither the sergeant\r\nnor his prisoner had any food for forty-eight hours. The police also\r\ncaptured George Bermingham. This man was a printer, born in Sydney, and\r\nwas twenty-one years of age. When taken he was full of braggadocio,\r\nboasted loudly of the number of people he had stuck up, and talked\r\nfamiliarly of Vane and Johnny Gilbert. He laughed at the idea of Ben\r\nHall having been shot as had been rumoured, and said, \"Wait till he's\r\nspent the five hundred quid he got from Keightley, and you'll soon hear\r\nof him again.\" Sergeant Donohoe said he had followed Dunne because he\r\nrecognised the magnificent chestnut horse he was riding as one ridden\r\nby the robbers of the Cooma mail. Dunne and Bermingham were sent to\r\ngaol for ten years for having been concerned in this robbery.\r\n\r\nIn the last week of November, Hall and Gilbert stuck up the Burrowa\r\nmail. Hall expressed his disgust at the number of cheques found in\r\nthe letters, and requested some of the passengers to cash them. As no\r\none volunteered to oblige him he continued--\"If I thought it would\r\ninjure them (the people who posted cheques presumably) I'd burn the----\r\nlot.\" The two bushrangers sat down to open the letters, leaving the\r\npassengers perfectly free. Gilbert took up one letter which had a black\r\nborder and laid it aside unopened, with the remark \"We must respect\r\ndeath.\" In one of the letters a piece of wedding cake was found, and\r\nGilbert proposed that they should eat it, but Hall objected, saying\r\n\"It may be a trap.\" This caution was common to all the bushrangers.\r\nThey were in constant dread of being poisoned, and were therefore very\r\ncautious as to what they ate or drank. One of the passengers, Mr.\r\nRobert Handley, described the two bushrangers as being well-dressed,\r\nhealthy looking, and very civil.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Hall and Gilbert went to Coffey's Inn, near\r\nBurrowa, and ordered breakfast. When they had finished their meal they\r\nwalked out on to the road and stopped every one who passed, compelling\r\nthem to go into the bar after handing over their money. Mr. Campbell,\r\nhowever, refused to stand when challenged. He struck spurs to his horse\r\nand galloped away. Hall fired at him and then rushed to the verandah\r\nand mounted his horse. He galloped only a short distance and then\r\nreturned, Campbell having too good a start. The bushrangers \"shouted\"\r\nfor their prisoners in the bar several times \"for the good of the\r\nhouse,\" and paid for what they ordered. It was said that they spent\r\nnearly as much as they had obtained from the persons robbed.\r\n\r\nOn December 16th Mr. Henry Morgan, one of the proprietors of the\r\n_Burrangong Star_, was driving, with his newly-married wife, between\r\nBowning and Binalong, when he was ordered to bail up by Hall and\r\nGilbert. Gilbert was in high spirits. He exchanged hats with Morgan,\r\nand put his poncho on Mrs. Morgan, declaring that she would make \"a\r\nfirst-rate bushranger.\" The newspaper man and his wife were taken into\r\nthe bush, and detained from eight a.m. till six p.m. During this time\r\nMr. George Franklin and his wife and four bullock drays were stuck\r\nup. One of the bullock-drivers named Sheedy had four bottles of gin\r\non his dray, and these were opened and the liquor served round. The\r\nrobbers asked Mrs. Franklin to cook breakfast \"for the crowd,\" taking\r\nthe necessary provisions from the loading on the drays. During the\r\nafternoon a number of other persons were brought into \"the camp.\"\r\nAll except one man were allowed to move about freely. This one man\r\nwas tied, and was spoken to very roughly and uncivilly. The man was\r\nsupposed to be \"a telegram,\" and this show of harshness \"a stall.\" At\r\nsix o'clock the camp was broken up, and the prisoners permitted to\r\nresume their journeys.\r\n\r\nThis performance was repeated the next and the two following days, near\r\nthe same spot, and although the individual losses were generally small,\r\nthe aggregate amount of money collected must have been considerable.\r\nOnly in one instance was any violence used. A bullock-driver named Lake\r\nrefused to turn out his pockets. Gilbert pressed the muzzle of his\r\nrevolver against Lake's face and said: \"If you don't do what you're\r\ntold I'll shove this down your---- mouth.\" Hall felt Lake's pockets\r\nand took out £5 in notes and some silver. At night, when released,\r\nLake asked for some of his money back to pay expenses along the road.\r\nGilbert replied: \"If you're a---- carrier your name's good for what you\r\nwant. If you hadn't been so ---- jolly you'd have got something. We\r\nalways divide with them that behave themselves.\"\r\n\r\nIn the week ending December 23rd, the Molong, the Cooma, the Tuena,\r\nand the Hartley mails were stuck up and robbed, proving that either\r\nthe gang was divided or that more than one party was at work in the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nA party including Messrs. Sheedy, Bass, Hutchinson, and other residents\r\nof the district, with several ladies, when returning home from one of\r\nthe numerous race parties held during the Christmas holidays, were\r\nordered to \"bail up.\" A lad was leading the racer Black Diamond, owned\r\nby Mr. Sheedy, and let him go. Ben Hall was furious. He galloped after\r\nthe racer, swearing, and tried to head him, but failed. He came back\r\nand threatened the boy and Mr. Sheedy, but soon grew cool. The ladies\r\nwere treated very civilly, but the robbers took watches and other\r\nvaluables and all the money they could find from the gentlemen. Black\r\nDiamond was found safe in his stable when Mr. Sheedy reached home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  A Heavy Sessions at Goulburn; Ben Hall Hard Pushed; An Amateur Mail\r\n  Robber; Discovery of Frank Gardiner; His Trial and Sentence; The Old\r\n  Man; A Brush with the Police; The Chinkies show Fight; Messrs.

During the\r\nholidays the activity of the robbers continued, and the disease spread\r\nto other districts. It will, however, perhaps be better to continue the\r\nhistory of this gang, and return later on to the actions of other gangs\r\nelsewhere. On February 7th, 1864, Inspector Brennan and Constables\r\nLovett and Roche went to a sly-grog shanty, as the places where strong\r\ndrinks were sold without a licence were called, and captured George\r\nLynam and Michael Seary. The horses of the two bushrangers were so\r\nexhausted with hard riding that although they mounted and rode away\r\nwhen the police came, they were soon caught, in spite of their long\r\nstart. They were charged and convicted of having robbed a number\r\nof persons at William Sidwell's, Governor's Arms Hotel, Towrang,\r\ntwo miles from Goulburn, in company with James Crookwell and Daniel\r\nMatthews. Lynam also, in company with John Southgate, stuck up and\r\nrobbed Thomas Cummins, Robert Sherwood, and others at Mr. Cornelius\r\nO'Brien's Station, near Binalong. They also stuck up Mr. Dwyer's place\r\nat Pudman's Creek, and after having made a bundle of all that was worth\r\ntaking away, compelled Mrs. Ann Dwyer to cook thirty-four eggs and a\r\nquantity of bacon for them. They tied Dwyer, struck Mrs. Dwyer, and\r\nthreatened to burn the place down unless they were told where the\r\nmoney was hidden. Jane Dwyer, daughter of Ann Dwyer, said that when\r\nthey went in to search the bedroom, Lynam exclaimed, pointing to the\r\ncrucifix, \"There's Jesus Christ. He ought to be burned, and I've a\r\ngood mind to do it.\" They smashed the furniture and broke open boxes\r\nand cupboards in their search for money. Lynam was sent to gaol for\r\nfifteen years, while Seary, Matthews, Crookwell, and Southgate were\r\nsentenced to ten years each for some offences, and to fifteen years for\r\nothers, but as the sentences were all made concurrent all the prisoners\r\nwere practically sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment. At the same\r\nsessions Charles Jones, alias William Herbert, and Frank Stanley, alias\r\nWright, were sentenced to twelve years for various acts of highway\r\nrobbery. Some of these young men were said to have assisted in some of\r\nthe robberies effected by the Hall and Gilbert gang, and were suspected\r\nof being on their way to join that gang. James Hill and James Jones\r\nwent to William Duguid's house at Mils, Twofold Bay, on March 13th, and\r\nstuck up all hands. It was early in the morning when they arrived, and\r\nthey sent everybody about the place into the kitchen and then searched\r\nthe house. Jones remained on guard while Hill went with the stockman\r\nto fetch up the horses. Mr. Duguid warned Jones that he expected the\r\npolice and advised him to go before they came to avoid bloodshed. Jones\r\nlaughed, and ostentatiously loaded the double-barrelled gun which he\r\nhad just taken from Duguid's bedroom. Hill returned with the horses,\r\nand while the bushrangers were selecting the ones they liked the police\r\narrived. Sub-Inspector John Garder Hussey challenged the bushrangers\r\nand called on them to surrender. For a minute or two the shooting was\r\nvery brisk, but it did not last long. Jones and Hussey fell wounded\r\nalmost simultaneously, and Hill ran away. He was followed by Constable\r\nZollner and captured, while Sergeant Chandler secured Jones. The wounds\r\nwere not very serious, but the bushrangers were sent to gaol for\r\nfifteen years. Ah Ling and ten other Chinese were living together in\r\na hut on the Abercrombie Goldfield. On May 2nd John Taylor and Thomas\r\nWebb drove the Chinamen into the kitchen and called them up one by one\r\nto be robbed. The first victim was Ah Wee. When asked for his gold he\r\nreplied \"No savee.\" He afterwards said he had none. Webb got a rope,\r\ntied it round the Chinaman's neck, and hauled him up to a sapling beam\r\nwhich ran across the building. After hanging for several minutes Ah\r\nWee was let down and asked whether he \"saveed now?\" He handed out his\r\ngold and explained at the trial that it made him \"welly sick.\" Ah Yong,\r\nAh See, and two or three others were served in the same way, and the\r\nothers gave up their gold without further compulsion. The prisoners\r\nwere sent to gaol for two years. The session was a remarkably heavy\r\none, and the majority of the cases tried were for robbery under arms.\r\n\r\nWhile the police had been very successful in bringing a number of\r\noutsiders to justice, the better known members of the gang continued to\r\nkeep the district alive. The _Yass Courier_ reported that nearly every\r\none in the district had turned out to hunt Ben Hall, who was reported\r\nto have paid them a visit. The bushranger had been so hard pressed\r\nthat he was forced to abandon Willy the Weasel, owned by Mr. Garry.\r\nThe horse was completely knocked up, otherwise the bushranger would\r\nnot have let him go, as he was a favourite. The stock riders of the\r\ndistrict had expressed great contempt for the police, their opinions\r\nbeing summed up as follows: \"They can't catch him. They don't know how\r\nto ride down a hill.\" Many of the \"hills\" in the district would be\r\nelsewhere considered almost as precipices.\r\n\r\nThe _Young_ (Burrangong) _Daily Tribune_ the same week reported that\r\na day or two ago Ben Hall walked alone into the stables at Groggan\r\nstation, Bland Plains, said \"Good morning, boys,\" and then proceeded\r\ncoolly to tie up the three men and a boy. Having secured these to\r\nhis entire satisfaction, he walked to the house and asked to see\r\nMr. Chisholm. On that gentleman coming to the door Hall said, \"Good\r\nmorning, Mr. Chisholm. I've come for Troubadour.\" \"You've left him\r\nso long you might do without him now,\" returned Mr. Chisholm. \"Oh,\"\r\nexclaimed Hall, \"you're getting too---- flash. If you consort with\r\ntraps you'll have to be taught manners.\" They walked to the stables,\r\nwhere Hall put saddles and bridles on Troubadour and Union Jack. The\r\nlast-named had won the Champion Plate at the Wagga Wagga races on\r\nNew Year's Day, and had only been brought home under police escort a\r\nday or two before. Hall also selected two other horses, which he said\r\nhe \"liked the look of,\" and put bridles on them. He then made Mr.\r\nChisholm fill two three-bushel bags with clothing from the store, and\r\nthese he packed on the spare horses. Then he mounted Troubadour, and\r\nleading the others started away. He had scarcely moved, however, before\r\nhe pulled up again, and said to Mr. Chisholm, \"That's a good looking\r\nwatch of yours. I want it. Hand it over.\" Mr. Chisholm did so, and\r\nthe bushranger then rode off. It may be explained that the reason why\r\nno opposition was attempted was because it was believed that Hall had\r\nplenty of support if he had required it. He never walked unless he was\r\ncompelled, and it was thought that his mates with the horses were not\r\nfar off. It was also suggested that Hall had a bad mount after he lost\r\nWilly the Weasel and that he did not wish to let Mr. Chisholm see him\r\nriding an inferior horse.\r\n\r\nThe mail coach from Wagga Wagga having failed to arrive at Cootamundra\r\nat the usual time, on May 12th, the contractor, Mr. Burke, supposed\r\nthat it had been stuck up somewhere along the road and rode out to\r\nmake enquiries. At about three miles from Cootamundra he found a\r\nnumber of letters lying scattered about the road. He gathered them up\r\nand continued his search. At length he found the mail-man drunk in a\r\npublic-house near Murrumburrah. The fellow had robbed the mail himself,\r\nno doubt with the intention of laying the blame on the bushrangers. He\r\nwas convicted and sentenced to seven years' penal servitude.\r\n\r\nThe mail was stuck up at Mumble Flat, between Orange and Wellington, on\r\nMarch 1st. A portion of the loading consisted of carbines and revolvers\r\nfor the police, \"all of which,\" said the _Orange Guardian_, \"were borne\r\noff to be used against them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bathurst-Sydney coach was stuck up at Lapstone Hill by three armed\r\nmen. The passengers were Michael Duffy, Constable McKay, in charge of\r\na female lunatic, and three Chinamen. After having collected the money\r\nfrom the passengers and searched the letters, the robbers extinguished\r\nthe coach lamps, took the horses out, and drove them up the hill.\r\nThe driver waited for half an hour, as he had been ordered to do, and\r\nthen started to catch his horses. This he managed to do with some\r\ndifficulty, and on his return he drove on to Penrith. From thence the\r\npassengers and the broken mail-bags were taken to Sydney by train.\r\nJohn Forster was arrested in a house at Strawberry Hills, Sydney, and\r\ncharged with having, with others, stuck up and robbed the mail coach\r\nbetween Penrith and Hartley at two a.m. Ah Lung, one of the passengers\r\non the coach, recognised a sash which the prisoner wore round his waist\r\nas his property, and said he carried his money in it. Forster was sent\r\nto gaol for ten years.\r\n\r\nAbout this time great excitement was caused throughout New South Wales\r\nby the report that Frank Gardiner had been discovered and arrested\r\nby Detective McGlone on March 3rd, at Apis Creek, on the road from\r\nRockhampton to the Peak Downs diggings, Queensland. Gardiner was\r\nkeeping a shanty, or roadside store, with Mrs. Brown, who passed as\r\nhis wife. Gardiner was brought to Sydney and duly committed for trial.\r\nIn connection with this case Mr. (afterwards Sir) E. Deas Thompson\r\nlaid a return on the table of the Legislative Assembly showing that\r\nthe amount stolen by Gardiner previous to his disappearance was about\r\n£21,000. Of this total, £13,694 had been stolen in the robbery of the\r\nLachlan Escort, and £5335 had been recovered by the police under Sir\r\nFrederick Pottinger. No murders were charged against Gardiner, but he\r\nwas convicted on three counts for highway robbery. On each of these\r\ncounts he was sentenced, on the first to twelve years and on the other\r\ntwo to ten years each. The first three years in irons in each case. The\r\nsentences were made cumulative, and aggregated thirty-two years. It\r\nwill be remembered that Captain Melville, the bushranger, was sentenced\r\nto a similar term of imprisonment in Victoria about twelve years\r\nbefore, and there were many people in New South Wales who thought that\r\nGardiner had been too harshly dealt with. Such a sentence, they said,\r\ndeprived a man of all hope, and rendered him desperate, and they would\r\nnot be surprised if Gardiner rebelled against it as Melville had done.\r\nThose who held this view were, however, in the minority. The majority\r\nsaid bushranging must be stamped out at any cost, and until this was\r\neffected the sentences could not be too severe.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of May Ben Hall, Gilbert, and a new recruit known as \"the\r\nOld Man,\" rode up to McGregor's Inn at Bong Bong, where a number of\r\nmen were on the verandah. The bushrangers ordered these men to \"throw\r\nyour arms up,\" enforcing the order with revolvers. There were some\r\ntwenty visitors on the verandah and in the bar, and these were ranged\r\nalong the wall in the dining room, with Hall on guard. Gilbert and\r\n\"the Old Man\" walked down the yard to the stables, where several\r\nracehorses were in the stalls under the charge of Constables Scott\r\nand Macnamara, who were escorting them to Burrangong for the races on\r\nQueen's birthday. Gilbert called to the constables to \"leave those\r\nhorses.\" The constables drew their revolvers, and fired by way of\r\nreply. The bushrangers fired, and Hall left the dining-room to take\r\npart in the scrimmage. For some minutes the shooting was very brisk,\r\nbut no one appeared to be hurt. The police were on foot and under cover\r\nof the stables, but the bushrangers were mounted and in the open yard.\r\nSuddenly the firing ceased as if by mutual consent, and Gilbert shouted\r\nthat they would be back presently. The bushrangers then rode away. As\r\nHall went out of the gate his cabbage tree hat fell off, and a cry was\r\nraised that he had been hit. He rode off, however, without showing\r\nany symptoms of injury. Believing that the bushrangers had gone for\r\nreinforcements the two constables barricaded the stables, and sent a\r\nmessenger to the nearest police depôt for assistance. About midnight\r\nSir Frederick Pottinger arrived with four troopers, but the bushrangers\r\ndid not return.\r\n\r\nOn the following afternoon the mail coach was stuck up at Emu Flat,\r\nbetween Burrangong and Yass. A passenger named Michael Curran saved his\r\ngold watch and chain by dropping them among the straw in the bottom of\r\nthe coach, but a valuable gold ring and £21 in notes were taken from\r\nhim. Ben Hall also exchanged an old poncho for a valuable rug, and an\r\nold clay pipe for a very fine meerschaum. Some distance away Mr. Barnes\r\nmet the coach, and the driver, J. Roberts, who knew him, warned Barnes\r\nthat the bushrangers were on the road. Barnes laughed and went on.\r\nHe was stopped and robbed, and as he did not hand out his money very\r\nreadily when ordered to do so, he was very roughly treated and was\r\nthreatened with death. Several teams were also robbed. The bushrangers\r\nwere riding the racers Teddington, Harkaway, and Troubadour.\r\n\r\nDuring this \"reign of terror,\" the Press, especially of the country\r\ndistricts, continued to urge the necessity for suppressing the \"bush\r\ntelegraphs\" and other sympathisers of the bushrangers, and said that\r\nwhile so many who aided them either by giving them information of the\r\nmovements of the police or providing them with hiding places when they\r\nwere hard pressed were at large the police had little chance of making\r\nheadway against the evil doers. The _Yass Courier_, for instance,\r\nspoke of \"the wealthy relations--of the bushrangers--with whom the\r\npolice are afraid to interfere, but whose places never have and never\r\nwill be stuck up.\" The paper \"perforce refrains from publishing the\r\nnames of these people on account of the state of the libel law,\" but\r\nit charges them with \"comforting and assisting the bushrangers.\" It\r\nseems difficult to understand what the police were expected to do, or\r\nto see what action could be taken against a settler because his place\r\nwas not raided, and who had some more or less distant relative \"on the\r\nroads.\" But this serves to show how closely the Press enquired into the\r\nantecedents and relationships of the bushrangers.\r\n\r\nA man, believed to be Johnny Gilbert, accompanied by a lad named\r\nRyan, stopped to dinner at the Korowatha Inn. They talked freely of\r\nbushranging, and laughed at the report that Hall had been hit at\r\nMcGregor's, as the newspapers had reported. They affirmed that \"the\r\ntraps could not fire straight enough to hit a haystack.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of June, the _Bathurst Times_ said: \"After an immunity\r\nfrom bushranging crimes in this district for some months, the gang has\r\nappeared once more and commenced operations. On the 18th, the mail\r\ncoach for Orange and the Lachlan started an hour late from this town\r\nin consequence of the heavy mail. There were on board James Nairne and\r\nseven passengers. About eighteen miles out, near the turn-off road to\r\nGuyong, three men jumped out of the bush and ordered the mail-man to\r\n'bail up.' The coach was taken off the road, where the passengers were\r\nrobbed and the letters torn open. The driver and passengers were then\r\ntold that they would be detained until the down mail came. While they\r\nwere waiting, a little boy was stopped and one pound of tea and 1s.\r\n6d. in money were taken from him. The boy's father, a farmer living\r\nnear, came out to look for his son, and was run in among the crowd.\r\nAfter some dispute the tea and the 1s. 6d. were given back, but the\r\nfather and son were compelled to remain until the other coach came by.\r\nThe down mail, driven by John Fagan, arrived about midnight and was\r\nstopped. Fagan was asked what made him so late, and replied that the\r\nroads were bad with the rains. The letters were opened, except those\r\nin the registered bag, which the robbers missed. About two a.m. the\r\nrobbers told their prisoners that they might go, and walked away.\" It\r\nwas said that this was not the Gilbert and Hall gang, as the robbers\r\nhad no horses. The police started in pursuit from Bathurst and Orange\r\nas soon as news of the robbery reached these towns.\r\n\r\nBen Hall and his gang stuck up and robbed Pearce and Hillier's store at\r\nCanowindra, and held the town for the day as on a previous occasion.\r\nThe following afternoon, June 23rd, they called at Mr. Rothsay's\r\nstation, took four horses from the stables, and set fire to a stack\r\ncontaining about 14 tons of hay as a \"caution to traitors.\"\r\n\r\nBen Hall, Johnny Gilbert, John Dunleavy, and James Mount (hitherto\r\nknown as \"the Old Man\") stuck up the Carcour and Cowra coaches. They\r\nthen rode on to the Half-Way House Hotel and compelled the landlord to\r\nhand over £76. They held the road for several hours, robbing all who\r\npassed, and bringing them to the hotel, where they \"shouted for all\r\nhands\" several times. This time the bushrangers drank port wine. They\r\ntook several well-bred horses from the stables. One of these got loose\r\nand galloped along the road. He was followed by Dunleavy, who failed to\r\nhead him. The horse was caught next day and sent to Bathurst for safety.\r\n\r\nTwo armed men endeavoured to stick up the Chinese Camp at Gilmandyke\r\nCreek, near Rockley. The Chinese fought bravely, returning the\r\nbushrangers' fire in a spirited manner with shot guns. A bushranger\r\nnamed Clayton was wounded and captured, when the other man rode away.\r\nThe Chinese were highly commended for their pluck, and several of the\r\nnewspapers said that they had set a good example for white men to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nHall and Mount went to Mr. Jamieson's station on the Bland River, and\r\ninformed the proprietor that they intended to stop for the night. They\r\ncalled the men up, asked their names and how much money each one had.\r\nHaving obtained this information they announced that they did not\r\nintend to take anything from any one. Possibly this decision may have\r\nbeen due to the fact that the total amount acknowledged to be in the\r\npossession of those present was small. Whether this was so or not,\r\nhowever, matters little. They ordered supper to be served, and made all\r\npresent sit down to the table in the dining-room. When the meal was\r\nover and the table cleared, Mr. Jamieson was asked to bring out some\r\nrum from the store. A pint pot, filled with hot water with plenty of\r\nsalt in it, was placed on the table, and Hall announced that if any\r\none present refused to sing or to contribute in some other way to the\r\ngeneral amusement, he would be compelled to swallow the contents of\r\nthis pannikin. Then they made a night of it. In the morning half the\r\nmen were lying on the ground in a drunken sleep, but the bushrangers\r\nwere quite sober, having drunk very little. They spent half-an-hour\r\nin the stable cleaning their horses, had breakfast, and rode away,\r\ndeclaring that they had enjoyed themselves immensely, and thanking Mr.\r\nJamieson for the entertainment he had afforded them.\r\n\r\nThey called at the next station and took the racehorse \"Plover\" out of\r\nthe stable. Mount ordered the stockman to fetch the horses out of the\r\npaddock, as he wanted to select one or two of the best stock-horses.\r\nWhile they were talking, the stockman moved round from Mount's right\r\nhand side to the left. The bushranger immediately shifted his revolver\r\nfrom the right hand to the left, remarking quietly: \"I can shoot just\r\nas straight left-handed as right.\" Hall said he had enjoyed many a good\r\nlaugh at the newspaper yarns about himself. He added that Brown's men\r\nwere \"jolly good fellows.\" In the evening they stuck up the Gundagai\r\nmail near Jugiong. When opening the letters Hall found a bulky roll of\r\nbank notes. \"Ah!\" he said, \"This is what I like.\" He took a number\r\nof newspapers away with him, \"just to see what they say about me.\"\r\nFrom thence they rode straight to the Chinese camp at Wombat, \"to give\r\nthe Chinkies a lesson.\" The Chinese were very slow in producing their\r\ngold, and the bushrangers fired in among them, killing one and wounding\r\nanother. The next day, Sunday, they stuck up a number of Chinamen\r\non the road and took their gold, but did not ill-treat them. In the\r\nafternoon they went to Mr. McCarthy's store in Jugiong and compelled\r\nhim to open the door. They selected a quantity of clothing and drapery,\r\nwhich they placed on a spare pack horse they had with them. In the\r\nevening they stuck up the Gundagai mail within a mile of the place\r\nwhere they had stuck it up a few days before. Hall took out a roll of\r\nhalf notes from one packet. \"This is a green trick, this is,\" he said,\r\nholding them up. \"It's little trouble to us to match half notes.\" This\r\nseries of outrages, following so closely one on the other, naturally\r\nstirred the police up to increased activity, and the bushrangers were\r\nso closely followed that a brush took place between them and the police\r\nin the last week of October. In this fight, which lasted only a very\r\nshort time, Dunleavy was severely wounded and surrendered, while Mount\r\nwas captured.\r\n\r\nJames Mount was an escaped convict, out on a ticket-of-leave. He was\r\nforty-five years of age, but had been called \"The Old Man\" before his\r\nname was known, to distinguish him from the young men and boys who\r\nformed the body of this gang. Mount was tried and convicted of highway\r\nrobbery in Bathurst, and was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon the capture of Mount and Dunleavy the _Goulburn\r\nHerald_ announced that their loss to the gang had been to some extent\r\ncompensated for by the accession of Johnny Dunn, who was born in\r\nMurrumburrah. Earlier in the year 1864 Dunn had won the principal prize\r\nat the Yass race meeting with the Binalong horse, Ringleader. He was an\r\nexcellent rider, and would no doubt give the police some trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Messrs. Hall, Gilbert, and Dunn seem to have obtained a lease of\r\nthe Main Southern road,\" said the _Yass Courier_ of November 19th.\r\nThey robbed the up and down mails from Gundagai two consecutive\r\nweeks. On the last of these four robberies the coach was bailed up\r\nat Deep Creek, near Jugiong, at about four p.m. Messrs. Bradley and\r\nSheahan, passengers, had alighted to walk up the steep hill, and were\r\nsome hundred yards or so ahead of the coach, when three men suddenly\r\nappeared from behind the scrub and ordered them to \"bail up.\" \"All\r\nright,\" replied Mr. Sheahan, holding his hands above his head. Hall\r\nsaid, \"That'll do. We've got a little township of our own up there.\r\nCome on.\" He pointed up the hill as he spoke. They followed him until\r\nthey came to a small, clear spot, surrounded with high trees and scrub.\r\nHere they saw twelve bullock drays and a number of men. Several horses\r\nwere hitched to the trees round the clearing, and the men who owned\r\nthem, as well as the bullock-drivers and some footmen, were seated on\r\nthe ground. When asked for his money Sheahan replied, \"Got none. Search\r\nif you like.\" \"Oh, you're not a bad sort,\" said Hall, \"we'll take your\r\nword for it.\" Bradley took out a cheque for £1, saying, \"That's all\r\nI've got. I brought it to pay my way on the trip.\" Hall put his hand\r\ninto Bradley's pocket, and finding nothing there told him to keep the\r\ncheque. A cask of port wine, which was found on one of the bullock\r\ndrays, was tapped, and the wine was handed round to all present in a\r\nquart pot in which tea had been made, as was evident by its colour.\r\nWhen the letters had been searched, the bushrangers told the company\r\nthat they might go.\r\n\r\nExpecting that the return mail would be robbed again next day Mr.\r\nRoss, police magistrate, and Constable Roche in private clothes went\r\nas passengers, while Inspector O'Neil and Sergeant Edmund Parry rode\r\nbeside the coach on horseback. At Black Springs, near Jugiong, the\r\nbushrangers appeared as had been anticipated, and on emerging from\r\nthe bush one of them shouted out, \"Hullo, here's the bobbies.\" Hall\r\nsaid, \"There's only two. Rush the----.\" The three bushrangers then\r\nrode forward shouting \"Come on, you----, fight like men.\" Sergeant\r\nParry rode forward and encountered Gilbert, and a desperate duel on\r\nhorseback with revolvers took place until Parry fell. In the meantime\r\nInspector O'Neil had kept under cover of the coach and managed to keep\r\nthe other two bushrangers at bay until Parry fell, when he surrendered.\r\nMr. Ross fired several shots, but what became of Constable Roche is\r\nnot known. He was not captured or wounded. He simply disappeared in\r\nthe scrub. When all was quiet Gilbert dismounted, turned over Parry's\r\nbody, and remarked coolly \"He got it in the cobbera. It's all over with\r\nhim. Well, I'm sorry for it. He's the bravest trap I've met yet.\" The\r\ncoach was taken off the road to where several bullock teams, two horse\r\ncarts with their Chinese owners, a buggy with Mr. and Mrs. Hayes, and\r\nseveral footmen and horsemen--among whom was Constable McLaughlin, who\r\nhad fired away his ammunition before he surrendered--were collected\r\ntogether. The robbers searched the letters as usual, took all the\r\npolice horses and arms, collected the money, watches, and other\r\nvaluables from the crowd and rode away saying \"We'll rob the mail\r\nto-morrow if all the---- traps in the colony are here.\" Whether this\r\nthreat was mere braggadocio, or whether the bushrangers intended to\r\ndraw the police here so that they might operate in safety elsewhere,\r\nhas been frequently argued without any definite result. The police\r\nwere on the road, and the bushrangers did not put in an appearance.\r\nThat is what is known. The day following, however, the gang stuck up\r\nthe Binalong mail, and after searching the letters, burned letters and\r\npapers to \"put a stop to the---- English correspondence.\"\r\n\r\nA day or two later, \"Messrs. Hall & Co.\" took possession of the road\r\nbetween the Fourteen Mile and the Fifteen Mile rushes at Burrangong\r\nand bailed up about thirty men, women, and boys. A bridle took the\r\nfancy of one of the gang, and he insisted on taking it and giving his\r\nown in return. With this exception, and the taking of a quantity of\r\nbread and butter found on the drays bailed up, nothing was stolen. The\r\nbushrangers explained that they expected some gold buyers along the\r\nroad, and when they came the camp would be broken up. In the meantime\r\nthey wanted every one to enjoy the picnic. The women were set to work\r\nto cut up and serve out the bread and butter. Fires were lighted and\r\ntea made. Then races and other sports were organised for the boys. One\r\nof the bailed-up men was a newsvendor, and the bushrangers \"borrowed\"\r\nhis papers and took it in turn to lie down and \"read the news.\" At last\r\none of the boys contrived to sneak away unseen, and as soon as his\r\nescape was discovered the camp was broken up and the robbers rode away.\r\n\r\nOn December 19th, the Hon. William Macleay, M.L.C., was driving in a\r\nbuggy from Towrang to Shelly's Flat, when he noticed a large crowd\r\na little way ahead. He sent his coachman on with the buggy and got\r\ndown to make enquiries. As he drew near he saw that a number of\r\npeople were standing round two bullock drays, while one or two men\r\nwere breaking open the boxes on the drays. Mr. Macleay asked a man\r\nwhat was the matter, and the man motioned to him to keep quiet. Mr.\r\nMacleay conjectured that it was the bushrangers robbing the drays,\r\nand withdrew as quietly as he had joined the crowd. He walked on to\r\nPlum's Inn, where he found a wedding party enjoying themselves. He told\r\nthe landlord what he had seen and his suspicions, and advised those\r\npresent to take precautions to avoid being robbed. Some time later\r\nthe bushrangers came up, and seeing a number of men on the verandah\r\nwith guns and revolvers in their hands, fired. Mr. Macleay immediately\r\nreturned the fire. The bushrangers drew together some distance away,\r\nand held a consultation. They apparently decided that the risk was\r\ntoo great, as they went off along the road. For beating off the\r\nbushrangers, and proving that a show of resistance might prevent\r\nrobberies, Mr. Macleay was awarded a gold medal by the New South Wales\r\nGovernment. As a _per contra_, the fact that the bushrangers robbed the\r\ndrays openly in the main road in this instance, instead of taking them\r\ninto the bush, was cited as evidence that they were growing bolder and\r\nmore careless of the police.\r\n\r\nHall, Gilbert, and Dunn rode up to a store at Binda, owned by an\r\nex-policeman named Morris, on December 21st, and took about £100\r\nfrom his cashbox. They informed Morris that a ball was being held\r\nat the Flag Hotel, and insisted on himself and Mrs. Morris dressing\r\nthemselves, and accompanying the bushrangers to the ball. Morris at\r\nfirst objected, but finally gave way. When they reached the Flag Hotel\r\nthe bushrangers mixed freely with the crowd, dancing and otherwise\r\nenjoying themselves. Presently some \"bush telegraph\" informed the\r\nbushrangers that Morris had been sounding several of the men present\r\nas to the probability of effecting a capture. Gilbert and Dunn drew\r\ntheir revolvers and started to look for Morris, who, having been\r\ninformed of what had transpired, jumped through an open window, and\r\nran towards where the bushrangers' horses were tied to trees. His\r\nintention was to take one and ride for the police. The bushrangers,\r\nhowever, caught sight of him and divining his intention ran and fired\r\nat Morris. This compelled him to turn aside and take refuge behind a\r\ntree. The bushrangers made no attempt to follow him. They removed their\r\nhorses to a safer place, then walked to the store, piled a quantity of\r\nbrushwood on the verandah, and set fire to it. Then they mounted their\r\nhorses, and sat and watched the blaze until the house was well alight,\r\nwhen they rode off. There were more than a hundred persons at the\r\nball, but no attempt was made to prevent the bushrangers from burning\r\ndown the store. In connection with this \"act of vengeance\" Christina\r\nMcKinnon and Ellen and Margaret Monks were arrested and charged with\r\nhaving aided and abetted in burning down Morris's store. The girls had\r\nbeen dancing with the bushrangers, and had accompanied them when they\r\nwent to the store. The police said that they were well known as \"bush\r\ntelegraphs,\" and cited instances in which it was supposed that they had\r\ngiven notice to the bushrangers of the approach of the police. Margaret\r\nMonks was discharged, but the other two were sent to gaol, the evidence\r\nshowing that they had assisted the bushrangers in piling wood on the\r\nverandah of the store.\r\n\r\nMr. D. Davis, auctioneer, of Yass, had been conducting a sale at\r\nMurrumburrah, and was returning home on December 30th when he was stuck\r\nup. He had on him £109 1s. 5d., the proceeds of the sale, principally\r\nin cheques. When these were handed out Ben Hall was in a furious rage,\r\nand threatened to burn them. Gilbert proposed that he should gallop on\r\nand \"change them before they're stopped.\" There was £1 5s. 6d. in cash,\r\nand of this they kept £1, returning the silver. They then rode rapidly\r\naway. Nothing more was heard of the cheques, the only thing known of\r\nthem being that they were never cashed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  Meeting the Gold Escort; Murder of Constable Nelson; A Brush with\r\n  the Police; Attempt to Stick Up the Araluen Gold Escort; Death of\r\n  Constable Kelly and Pluck of Constable Burns; Sir Frederick Pottinger\r\n  Resigns; Death of Ben Hall; Sketch of his Life; Death of Johnny\r\n  Gilbert; Record of John Dunn and the Gang; Capture and Trial of\r\n  Johnny Dunn; His Execution; Fate of the Chief Members of the Gardiner\r\n  Gang.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike many other young men I spent a few years on the diggings in hopes\r\nof making \"my pile,\" and early in 1865 I, in company with two mates,\r\nleft the King's Plains, where we had just finished working out a hole,\r\nand started for Apple Tree Flat, near Mudgee, where a rush had recently\r\ntaken place. We were well mounted, and had a packhorse which \"belonged\r\nto the firm.\" One of my mates was a keen sportsman, and his horse had\r\nwon several prizes at those country meetings known as \"Publican's\r\nRaces,\" from the fact that they were organised by a publican and\r\nheld near his house for obvious business reasons. We were travelling\r\nsteadily along the road leading from Blaney to Bathurst, near Back\r\nCreek, when we saw the Government Gold Escort in the distance. The\r\npolice authorities of New South Wales had learned a lesson from the\r\nGreat Escort Robbery of 1862, and no longer mounted all the police on\r\nthe coach or drag in which the gold was conveyed to Sydney. At the\r\nplace we had arrived at the road, a chain and a half wide (99 feet),\r\nhad been cleared through a stretch of heavy forest timber. It ran as\r\nstraight as possible as far as the eye could reach, and was bordered on\r\neither side by a dense growth of timber and scrub rising to a height\r\nof from 200 to 300 feet like a wall of greenery. In the centre of the\r\nroadway was a metalled or gravelled road about fifteen feet wide. The\r\nremainder on either side was graded to near the timber line, where\r\na small cutting to carry off surface water was made. We rode on the\r\nsoft grassy side slopes and left the metalled or gravelled road for\r\nvehicles. It was in the centre of this gorge in the forest that we\r\nfirst sighted the escort. First rode a single trooper; at fifty yards\r\ndistance came two more; then, at about the same distance, came the\r\nescort cart, drawn by four horses, the driver and another policeman\r\nsitting on the front seat, while a third trooper sat behind. A mounted\r\ntrooper also rode one on each side of the cart. Fifty yards further\r\nback were two more troopers, while the rear was brought up by another\r\nsingle trooper. The troopers had their carbines ready in their hands,\r\nthe butts resting on their thighs. When the leading trooper came within\r\nhail of us, he cried \"Halt,\" and raised his rifle. We halted. The\r\ntwo troopers behind him came forward at a rapid pace until they were\r\nnear enough to support him, if necessary. The cart stopped, and the\r\nother troopers gathered round it ready to defend it. The sergeant in\r\ncharge inquired what our names were, where we were going, and what was\r\nour business. We told him. He said our horses were superior to those\r\nusually ridden by diggers. We replied that we didn't care about riding\r\nold screws. He asked whether the two guns we carried were loaded. We\r\ninformed him that one was loaded with shot in case we came across a\r\nduck or a pigeon. He told us to sit up straight and follow him. Then he\r\nmotioned to the two troopers just behind him. He led the way while the\r\ntroopers followed behind us. We all kept to the side of the road; the\r\ncart having been drawn up on the other side. The other troopers sat on\r\ntheir horses, carbine in hand, as we passed. It was a most impressive\r\nshow of force out there in the bush. The sergeant and two troopers\r\nconducted us for about a hundred yards past the cart and then pulled\r\nup. The sergeant said it was difficult to tell what men were by their\r\nappearance. He advised us to be very careful, and asked if we had any\r\ngold or money with us. We told him that we had been at Lambing Flat,\r\nand knew what the state of the country was. We did not feel disposed to\r\ncarry gold or very much money with us while there were banks in every\r\ntown. He said we were right and wished us good day after telling us\r\nto ride straight on and not attempt to turn back. We laughed and said\r\nwe were travelling in the opposite direction and had no desire to turn\r\nback. In talking the matter over in our camp that night we decided that\r\ngreat as the improvement in the escort service had been it would not\r\nbe impossible to rob the escort again. If, for instance, we had been\r\npart of a gang of bushrangers, sent to draw the attention of the police\r\nto us, while another portion of the gang had been hidden in the scrub,\r\nopposite where the cart stood, the troopers might have been shot down\r\nalmost without a chance of defending themselves. However, the escort\r\nprotection seems to have been sufficient, as it was not robbed again,\r\nalthough one or two attempts were made in other districts.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week or two of 1865 very little was heard of Messrs.\r\nHall & Co., but on January 26th the three principal members of the\r\nfirm (Hall, Gilbert, and Dunn), stuck up Mr. Kimberley's store in Main\r\nStreet, Collector. Dunn was stationed on guard on the verandah while\r\nHall and Gilbert went inside to select such articles as they required\r\nor fancied. Constable Nelson, the only policeman stationed in the\r\nlittle town, was at the lock-up, and on being informed of what was\r\ngoing on he loaded his carbine and walked down the street towards the\r\nstore. Dunn saw him coming and withdrew out of sight behind the fence\r\nat the corner of the verandah, and when the constable was only a few\r\nyards distant the robber fired at him. The constable fell, and Dunn,\r\ncoming out of his hiding-place, walked to where he was lying, put his\r\nrevolver close to the constable's head, and fired again. Hearing the\r\nshots, Hall and Gilbert came out, and on seeing what had been done,\r\nheld a whispered consultation, and then mounted their horses and rode\r\naway. They went straight to Alfred Cramp's farm at Binda, and ordered\r\ndinner. While they were still at table a party of police galloped\r\nup, dismounted, and rushed into the front door of the house as the\r\nbushrangers went out of the back door. A few shots were fired, but the\r\nbushrangers mounted and escaped, owing to the superiority of their\r\nhorses. The news of Constable Nelson's death had been conveyed to\r\nthe police at once, and they had followed close on the tracks of the\r\nbushrangers.\r\n\r\nIn February a number of persons were stuck up near Illalong, on the\r\nroad between Yass and Burrangong. The robbers were said to have no\r\nconnection with the firm of Hall & Co., as they robbed their victims\r\nof their coats and vests. The Hall gang never did this. If they saw a\r\nman with a coat or vest, or any other article of clothing to which they\r\ntook a fancy, they would exchange with him, but they only stole clothes\r\nfrom the stores. However, while the police were out in search of these\r\nplebeian bushrangers, they happened to come across Hall and Gilbert\r\nat Lodge's Inn, Breadalbane Plains, and captured their horses. It was\r\nsupposed that the two robbers had been sleeping in the barn. They\r\nrushed out when the police came, and went across a cleared paddock,\r\nboth parties firing their revolvers. Constable Wiles was wounded, and\r\nBen Hall was supposed to have been wounded, as he fell. He was up again\r\nin a moment, however, and succeeded in reaching the timber, the ground\r\nbeing too rough and heavily-timbered for the police horses to make\r\ntheir way through it.\r\n\r\nA daring attempt was made by Hall and three others to stick up the\r\nAraluen escort on March 16th. The bushrangers fired from behind trees\r\nas the escort cart was going up Major's Creek Mount, at the same place\r\nwhere a similar attempt had been made about two and a half years\r\npreviously. Constable Kelly fell wounded, and died a few days later.\r\nConstable Burns, who was driving, jumped off the cart, put a stone\r\nbehind the wheel, and then fired, shouting \"Come on.\" Mr. Blatchford,\r\nJ.P., who had been riding beside the driver, remained on his seat until\r\na voice from behind the trees cried out, \"Shoot the---- on the cart.\"\r\nHe then jumped down quickly, but was wounded in the leg. He fell, but\r\ngot up again immediately and ran down the hill to Noonan's Hotel for\r\nassistance. Constable Stapleton and his companion forced their horses\r\nup the steep cutting which bordered the road, and disappeared among the\r\ntrees. Burns, thus left alone with the cart, sheltered himself behind\r\nit as well as he could, and kept blazing away coolly from his cover.\r\nSuddenly, Constable Stapleton and his companion attacked the robbers in\r\nthe rear. Gilbert turned sharply, and said, \"You're a---- good shot,\r\ntake that,\" and shot the constable's horse. The two policemen, however,\r\nkept up the firing, and the bushrangers mounted their horses and rode\r\naway. Mr. Blatchford presented Constable Burns with a cheque for £50,\r\nas a reward for the pluck he had shown in defending his charge.\r\n\r\nIt was at about this time that Sir Frederick Pottinger, who was in\r\ncommand of the police in this district, was charged with having\r\nneglected his duty. Sir Frederick had ridden in a gentleman's race on\r\nthe Wowingragong course. It was rumoured that the bushrangers, for whom\r\nhe was supposed to be looking, had been on the course too, and had\r\nnot been recognised. Sir Frederick was called to Sydney to attend an\r\ninquiry, and resigned his position in the force. About a month later he\r\ndied from the effects of a wound from a pistol, accidentally fired by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe gang yarded a mob of horses at a station near Murrumburrah and\r\npicked out several of the finest horses, which they took away, leaving\r\ntheir own knocked-up horses in their place. They rode to Wombat,\r\nwhere they stuck up a mob of Chinamen, one of whom was shot to make\r\nthe others \"shell out\" their gold more quickly. Then the bushrangers\r\ntravelled to Forbes, and on the following day robbed Mr. Jones's store\r\nof £81 in cash and a quantity of clothing and drapery. Information was\r\ngiven to the police in the town as soon as the robbers left the store,\r\nand a party of police with two black trackers followed them. On the\r\nfollowing evening, May 5th, they came on two hobbled horses feeding\r\nnear the Billabong Creek. These were recognised as horses which had\r\nbeen ridden by the bushrangers, and the police watched them carefully\r\nwithout allowing themselves to be seen. This was not difficult, as\r\nthere were thick patches of scrub about the flat. Half-an-hour later a\r\nman came out of one of these patches of scrub, unhobbled the horses,\r\nand led them away for about two hundred yards to where there was better\r\ngrass. It was at that time too dark to distinguish him. He rehobbled\r\nthe horses and retired into the scrub once more. The police drew up\r\ncloser to this patch with great caution and watched till morning. At\r\ndaybreak the man appeared again and looked round to ascertain whether\r\nthe horses were in sight, and Inspector Davidson immediately recognised\r\nhim as Ben Hall and called on him to stand. Hall turned to go back\r\ninto the patch of scrub, and the inspector fired at him. Sergeant\r\nCondell and the four policemen also fired, and Hall stopped and leaned\r\non a sapling for support. Then Constable Hopkiss took steady aim and\r\nfired again, and Hall let his revolver fall from his hand. The police\r\nwent forward and Hall said \"I'm hit. Shoot me dead.\" He relaxed his\r\nhold on the sapling, staggered forward and fell. The police rushed up,\r\nbut he died before any attempt could be made to staunch the blood. On\r\nthe body being examined one rifle and six revolver bullet wounds were\r\nfound, any one of which should have proved fatal. The bushrangers'\r\nhorses were soon caught, the body was strapped on one of them, and\r\nthe party returned to Forbes. The police were much surprised to find\r\nHall alone, but conjectured that Gilbert and Dunn had gone down the\r\nLachlan River to some of the great stations to procure horses, all the\r\nracehorses about Burrangong having been pretty well exhausted. The two\r\ncaptured with Hall were in very poor condition, and had evidently been\r\nridden hard. It was supposed that they had knocked up, and that Hall\r\nhad stayed behind while his companions sought fresh mounts. He thought\r\nhe was quite safe in the scrub, so far away from his usual haunts.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Hall was about twenty-eight years of age. His father had come\r\nto the Wedden Mountains district in about 1840, when little Ben was\r\nabout three years old. The elder Hall had worked for Mr. Ranken for\r\nsome years, and had always borne a good character. When Ben was old\r\nenough he had engaged as stockman with Mr. Hamilton, of Tomanbil. He\r\nsaved money, and took up a small station for himself at the Pinnacle,\r\nabout fifteen miles from Forbes. He married a daughter of another\r\nsettler. He had no sympathy with the bushrangers when the outbreak\r\nunder Gardiner occurred, and the police frequently stopped for a\r\nnight at his house when looking for the bushrangers near his station.\r\nHis wife was of a flighty disposition, and was seduced, it was said,\r\nby a police official, and Hall joined the gang \"to meet the man who\r\nruined my happiness.\" Such was the story currently believed in the\r\nneighbourhood, and Ben was the only one of the bushrangers for whom\r\nthe general public, apart from those who were related to or interested\r\nin them, felt any sympathy. Before \"he took to the bush,\" he was known\r\nas a steady, industrious, kind-hearted young man, and numbers could\r\nscarcely believe that it was the same Ben Hall, the noted bushranger,\r\nof whom everybody was talking.\r\n\r\nThe death of Ben Hall no doubt had a depressing effect on the\r\nbushrangers generally, but it by no means put an end to their\r\ndepredations. On the 11th May, a horse was stolen from Murrumburrah,\r\nand on the following day the horses at Mr. Furlonge's station were\r\nrounded up and a racehorse taken away, the Murrumburrah horse being\r\nleft instead of it. Information was immediately sent to the police,\r\nand a party, with the aid of a black tracker, followed the tracks\r\ntoward Binalong. The place being near the house where Johnny Dunn's\r\nparents lived, the police camped near and watched the little township\r\nall night, but saw nothing to excite their suspicions. In the morning\r\na lad named Thomas Kelly, brother of one or two convicted bushrangers,\r\nwas asked whether any one was staying at his grandfather's house, and\r\nreplied \"No.\" Constables Hales and King, however, walked up to old\r\nKelly's place, and pushed the door open. Gilbert and Dunn were in\r\nthe front room, and immediately fired at the police, who retreated.\r\nA few minutes passed, during which the police were looking to their\r\nrevolvers, and then the two bushrangers were seen to emerge by the\r\nback door and walk steadily down the paddock. The police followed,\r\nand some shots were exchanged. Near the fence the bushrangers made\r\na stand, and there was a pause for a second or so. Then Constables\r\nHales and Bright fired together, and Gilbert fell. Dunn jumped over\r\nthe fence and dashed in among the trees. Some of the police followed,\r\nbut he soon disappeared. On examination it was found that a bullet had\r\nentered Gilbert's breast and passed out below the left shoulder-blade,\r\nhaving travelled through the left ventricle of the heart. He was then\r\nabout twenty-five years of age. Old Kelly was arrested and charged with\r\nhaving harboured bushrangers, and was sent to gaol.\r\n\r\nJohn Dunn, the last of this notorious trio, did not long survive\r\nhis two mates. His record as given in the _Yass Courier_ is very\r\ninstructive. He joined Hall and Gilbert a few days after the capture\r\nof Mount and the wounding of Dunleavy, and on the 24th of October\r\nrobbed Mr. Chisholm on the highway near Goulburn. On the 28th he stuck\r\nup Mr. Macansh's station. On the 28th robbed the Albury mail near\r\nJugiong. On November the 8th robbed Mr. Rossi's station, near Goulburn.\r\nOn the 9th robbed the Southern mail six miles from Goulburn. On the\r\n11th robbed the Yass mail on Breadalbane Plains. On the 15th robbed\r\nthe Gundagai mail near Jugiong, and had a desperate fight with the\r\npolice, Sergeant Parry being shot by Gilbert. On the 19th robbed Mr.\r\nClarke's station at Bolero. On December 19th stuck up the Goulburn\r\nmail near Towrang. On the 27th stuck up Mr. Morris's store at Binda,\r\nforced Mr. and Mrs. Morris to go to a ball, and finally burned his\r\nstore and dwelling-house. On the 30th stuck up Mr. Davidson and others\r\non the Murrumburrah Plains. On January 19th, 1865, stuck up Mr. James\r\nChristie's store. On the 25th stuck up Mr. Ross and others on the\r\nGap Road. On the 27th stuck up a number of carriers and the hotel at\r\nCollector, and shot Constable Nelson. On February 6th stuck up the\r\nGoulburn mail twelve miles from Goulburn. On the 18th stole racehorses\r\nfrom Messrs. McAlister's and Bowne's. On the 23rd had a desperate fight\r\nwith the police on Breadalbane Plains, when several were wounded and\r\nthe robbers lost their horses. On March 13th stuck up the Gundaroo\r\nmail near Geary's Gap. On the 14th attempted to rob the Araluen escort\r\nat Major's Creek, when one policeman was mortally wounded, two others\r\nput to flight, while the fourth beat off the bushrangers and saved the\r\ngold. On the 22nd seen at Gardiner's old haunt near the Pinnacle. On\r\nthe 24th went to Mr. Atkin's place, near the Billabong Creek, had a\r\ngood dinner and enjoyed themselves, besides feeding the horses they\r\nhad stolen from Mr. Morton the day before. Left on the 25th, taking\r\nclothes for winter wear and about £90 in cash from Mr. Jones's store,\r\nForbes. On April 1st stuck up Mr. Sutton's station at Boramble. On the\r\n10th robbed Mr. Watt's Inn at Newra. On the 11th robbed Mr. Gallimore's\r\nstore and the White Horse Inn at Black Rock. On the 18th bailed up the\r\nNewbiggen Inn, organised a _soirée dansante_, and compelled all hands\r\nand the cook to take part in it. Afterwards robbed Mr. Lee's station at\r\nLarras Lake. On the 25th robbed Mr. Cropper's station on the Lachlan.\r\nOn May 8th robbed two travellers on the Cowra Road, eighteen miles from\r\nMarengo. On the 11th robbed Mr. Furlonge's station. On the 14th four\r\npolicemen attacked the bushrangers near Binalong, when Gilbert was shot\r\nand Dunn wounded. On the 15th Dunn alone stuck up Julian's station, and\r\ntook a racehorse, a saddle and bridle, and some food. He was not heard\r\nof again until December 18th, when he was recognised by the police near\r\nMr. McPhail's station, Walgett, and pursued. He escaped, but two days\r\nlater a man in whom he had confided gave information to the police as\r\nto his whereabouts, and a desperate struggle took place, Dunn being\r\nwounded in three places and Constable McHale also severely wounded;\r\nDunn, however, was captured.\r\n\r\nThis record of the achievements of the gang during the time that Dunn\r\nwas a member--namely, from October 24th, 1864, to May 15th, 1865, or\r\nrather less than seven months--although not quite complete, serves to\r\ngive a very vivid idea of the terrible scourge which the bushrangers\r\nwere to the country. The gang was not more active during the time\r\ncovered by this record than it had been before, or since it was first\r\norganised by Frank Gardiner in 1861, while some of the most extensive\r\nrobberies committed by the gang belong to the earlier period. However,\r\nwith the capture of Johnny Dunn this gang ceased to exist, and we have\r\nonly to finish the story of his life before turning back to take notice\r\nof the proceedings of other gangs of bushrangers in other parts of the\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nConstable McHale and John Dunn were conveyed as carefully as possible,\r\nand by slow stages, from Walgett to the lock-up at Dubbo, to be nursed\r\nback to health. After some weeks, Dunn appeared to be growing strong,\r\nand as his character was well known, it was deemed expedient to put\r\nhim in irons. He resented this treatment, very naturally perhaps, and\r\nrefused to eat. He groaned so continuously that he prevented McHale,\r\nwho was in bed in the same room in the watch-house, from sleeping.\r\nThe police were taken in by this shamming, and thought that Dunn was\r\ndying. They therefore took off his irons. The watch-house was an\r\nordinary four-roomed weather-board cottage with a verandah. It had been\r\nbuilt as a residence for the local policeman. Behind, was a stronger\r\nbuilding divided into two or three cells for the safe-keeping of the\r\nfew evil-doers likely to be arrested in this settlement on the borders\r\nof civilisation. The sick men were in bed in the cottage, the window\r\nof which was only a couple of feet above the level of the plain on\r\nwhich the town of Dubbo stands. Dunn was not altogether shamming. He\r\nwas very weak, but he was strong enough when his irons were removed to\r\nwatch for an opportunity to escape. He placed his pillow length-ways\r\nin the bed, covered it with the sheet, which was the only covering\r\nrequired in that district at that time of the year, and placed a red\r\nsilk handkerchief where his head was supposed to rest, as if to keep\r\nthe flies or mosquitoes off his face. This was no doubt done to induce\r\nMcHale, and any one else who came into the room, to believe that he\r\nwas still sleeping. However, when daylight came, McHale saw that the\r\nthing in the other bed was not Dunn and pounded on the floor with a\r\nboot, being too weak to shout. At the time the police on duty in the\r\nnext room were laughing and joking about something, and it was some\r\nminutes before McHale could make them hear. At length one of them came\r\nin, and on being told that Dunn was gone, gave the alarm. The tracks\r\nin the dust outside showed that the robber had simply stepped out of\r\nthe window, which was kept open on account of the heat, and had made\r\nfor the bush. It was Sunday morning, January 11th, 1866, and very few\r\npeople were about in the little town. The tracks were lost among the\r\nnumber of tracks in the roadway and there was no one to give the police\r\nany information as to the direction in which the bushranger had gone.\r\nSearch parties were organised and sent out in all directions.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles away a brickmaker was watching his kiln and gathering\r\nbrushwood for his fire, although it was Sunday morning, when a man\r\ncrawled out from behind a log and begged for a \"drink of water, for\r\nGod's sake.\" It was Dunn. He told the brickmaker who he was and begged\r\nhim to lend him a horse to get away. \"Only save me from hanging and\r\nI'll make it up to you,\" he cried, but the brickmaker refused. He\r\nwent and caught his horse and rode into Dubbo to inform the police,\r\nwho returned with him and recaptured the runaway. Dunn was forwarded\r\nto Bathurst without delay and was lodged in the gaol, while Smith,\r\nthe brickmaker, was rewarded for the assistance he had rendered in\r\neffecting the recapture of the noted bushranger.\r\n\r\nBy the latter end of February Dunn was sufficiently recovered from the\r\neffects of his wound to be placed on trial. He was charged with the\r\nmurder of Constable Nelson. The evidence shows that a number of persons\r\nhad been stuck up on the road between Taradale and Collector. They were\r\nmarched to Kimberley's Hotel and taken inside by Hall and Gilbert,\r\nwhile Dunn remained outside in charge of the horses. Dunn called a\r\nboy, who was standing in the street and who chanced to be the son of\r\nConstable Nelson, and told him to hold the horses and not let them go\r\nunless he wanted his brains blown out. The party in the hotel were\r\nsinging and dancing, and the constable hearing the noise walked from\r\nthe watch-house to where his son was and asked him what was going on.\r\nThe boy told him the bushrangers were there and the constable returned\r\nto his house for his gun. When he came back he did not see Dunn, who\r\nwas hiding behind the fence, and walked towards the front door of the\r\nhotel, when he was shot as already related. Gilbert came to the door\r\nimmediately and Dunn cried out \"I've shot the---- trap.\" Gilbert walked\r\nto where the body was lying, turned it over, and took off the belt,\r\nsaying \"This is just what I wanted. I've lost mine.\" At that moment\r\nHall came up and the three bushrangers took their horses and went off.\r\nDunn was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was hung on March\r\n19th, 1866. He was of slight build and only twenty-two years old when\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\nOf the chief members of this gang Gardiner was sentenced to thirty-two\r\nyears' penal servitude; Vane surrendered owing to the influence of\r\nFather McCarthy and was sent to gaol for fifteen years; Bow and Fordyce\r\nwere sentenced to death, but their sentences were commuted to fifteen\r\nyears' imprisonment; Manns, Peisley, and Dunn were hanged; Lowry, Ben\r\nHall, and Gilbert were shot by the police, and Burke and O'Meally by\r\ncivilians; Mount or \"the Old Man\" was sent to gaol for ten years.\r\n\r\nThere were others who either claimed or were supposed to be members\r\nof this gang, but it is difficult to say with certainty how far these\r\nclaims were justified. Some of these have already been referred to,\r\nand others will be mentioned further on. Probably some who intended to\r\njoin the gang were captured before they had an opportunity to do so.\r\nOthers merely said they had been out with Ben Hall or Johnny Gilbert\r\non account of the kudos they gained among their fellows. However this\r\nmay be, the majority of the members of this gang were quite young men,\r\nmany of them little more than boys. Several were under twenty years of\r\nage, and all with the exception of Mount, sometime known as \"the Old\r\nMan,\" under thirty. Their lives may have been exciting, but they were\r\nshort, and none of them, with the exception of Gardiner perhaps, made\r\nany money by their robberies. They all died poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n  Bloodthirsty Morgan; Morgan's Opinion of the Police; Murder of\r\n  Sergeant McGinnerty; Murder at the Round Hill Station; A Pseudo\r\n  Morgan; Morgan Threatens to Brand all Hands; He Shoots Sergeant\r\n  Smyth; Challenged to Visit Victoria; He Accepts the Challenge; His\r\n  Death at Peechelba.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel Morgan began his career as a bushranger shortly after the\r\nGreat Escort Robbery, by sticking up travellers on the roads about\r\nWagga Wagga. His head-quarters generally were said to be in the huge\r\npatch of scrub, which stretched away southward, from the Murrumbidgee\r\nRiver across the low ranges between Wagga Wagga and Narrandera. He\r\nwas credited with being the most bloodthirsty of the New South Wales\r\nbushrangers after Willmore. We have seen that some of the members\r\nof the chief gang of this era held human life very cheaply, but it\r\nwas the general opinion that, except in the case of a few Chinamen,\r\nthese bushrangers murdered only when on the warpath. In many cases\r\nthey met the police boldly, and fought with some degree of fairness;\r\nwhile Morgan, on more than one occasion, fired on unarmed, and in some\r\ncases sleeping men. For some months he pursued his career without\r\nmuch interference from the police, and it was said that some of the\r\nmembers of the Hall and Gilbert gang had made a raid to the Southern\r\ndistrict. When it became apparent that he had no connection with\r\nthat gang and continued his depredations alone, a party of police\r\nwas detailed to hunt him down about the middle of 1863. In August of\r\nthat year, this party of police tracked him for several days, and\r\ncame on his camp on the 22nd. A desperate fight took place, in which\r\nMorgan's mate was severely wounded and crawled into the bush to die.\r\nThis man was known as \"German Bill.\" On the other side, Mr. Bayliss,\r\nJ.P., a volunteer who accompanied the police, was severely wounded.\r\nHe recovered, however, and was awarded a gold medal by the New South\r\nWales Government for bravery in opposing bushrangers. Morgan made his\r\nescape in the scrub. Later on the same day a shepherd was shot dead on\r\nBrookong station, and it was supposed that the murderer was in league\r\nwith Morgan. About Christmas Morgan with three companions watched\r\nthe road, near Narrandera, with the intention of sticking-up several\r\nwealthy squatters who were in the habit of travelling to Melbourne at\r\nabout that time of the year. Fortunately for themselves, they that year\r\ntook a cross track, and thus escaped the meeting. While waiting Morgan\r\ntook about 2lb. of cheese from a bullock driver named John Cole. There\r\nwere several cheeses in the dray, and when Morgan said he should \"like\r\na bit\" Cole offered him one, and told him to \"take the lot.\" Morgan\r\nreplied that \"the---- traps would risk their necks climbing over the\r\narea railings for a leg of mutton. I don't know what they'd do for a\r\nwhole cheese, but this lump's enough for me.\" He afterwards remarked\r\nthat the police generally were \"a sour milk lot.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next few months robberies occurred in various parts of the\r\nextensive tract of country between Wagga Wagga and Deniliquin, and\r\nwere, of course, all attributed to the Morgan gang. On April 16th,\r\n1864, Mr. George Elliott, of Burrangong, with a stockman named Donnelly\r\nreached Deniliquin, with a mob of horses for sale. In consequence of\r\nsome rumours which spread through the town, Mr. Elliott was closely\r\nquestioned by the sergeant of police, and after some hesitation\r\nadmitted that he had been stuck up by Morgan and robbed of £127 17s.\r\nand a bay horse with saddle and bridle, on the road between Narrandera\r\nand Jerilderie. He said that when he got rid of his horses he would\r\nhave to return home by the same route, and thought it prudent to hold\r\nhis tongue, \"the least said the soonest mended,\" as there was no saying\r\nwhom he might meet on the road.\r\n\r\nIn June, Sergeant McGinnerty and Constable Churchley were riding\r\nalong the road to Tumberumba, when they overtook a horseman near\r\nCopabella. McGinnerty civilly said \"Good-day\" as they passed, in the\r\nusual Australian fashion. The man looked at him and replied, \"Oh,\r\nyou're one of the---- wretches looking for bushrangers, are you?\" and\r\nhastily drew a revolver and shot McGinnerty through the breast. The\r\nsergeant's horse bolted, and the bushranger galloped after him into\r\nthe bush. Constable Churchley rode back to Copabella for assistance,\r\nand on his return with a party and fresh horses found McGinnerty's hat\r\nlying in the road, and opposite to it, at some distance away, the body.\r\nIt was supposed that the bushranger had placed the hat on the road\r\nto indicate where the body was, and to facilitate its discovery. The\r\nrobber must have ridden straight from the scene of this cold-blooded\r\nmurder to the Round Hill station, where he mustered all the men and\r\ndrove them into the carpenter's shop. He then went to the house,\r\ncalled out the proprietor, Mr. Watson, and led him to the door of the\r\ncarpenter's shop. He enquired whether the men had sufficient rations.\r\n\"If they haven't,\" said Mr. Watson, \"they've only got to say so and\r\nthey'll get more.\" \"Well, I'm Dan Morgan, I just wanted to know, and\r\nyou'd better give them a nobbler,\" replied the bushranger. Mr. Watson\r\nsaid he'd no objection to the men having a nobbler, and sent to the\r\nhouse. The messenger returned with four bottles of spirits, and each\r\nman was given a nobbler in a pannikin. The men laughed and took it as a\r\ngood joke. One of them asked the bushranger whether he had \"stolen his\r\nstirrup irons from Mr. Johnstone?\" Morgan with a curse immediately drew\r\nhis pistol, and fired into the room. The men ran out. Morgan followed\r\nthem, shouting, \"You---- wretches, do you want to give me away?\" He\r\nfired several times, until John McLean fell wounded. By this time the\r\nmen had sheltered themselves behind trees. Seeing no one to shoot at\r\nMorgan dismounted, lifted McLean carefully on to his horse, and led the\r\nanimal to the house. Mr. Watson and some of the women took McLean in,\r\nand Morgan mounted and rode away. Then it was discovered that another\r\nman, John Heriot, was lying wounded in the carpenter's shop. Heriot's\r\ninjury consisted of a broken leg, and he was placed in a buggy and\r\nconveyed with as little delay as possible to the hospital at Albury.\r\nBut McLean's wound was too serious to admit of his removal, and he died\r\nafter lingering in pain for two or three days. At the inquest held on\r\nthe body, Edward Smith, stockman at the Round Hill station, deposed\r\nthat Morgan had called at the station two days after the attack to\r\nenquire how McLean was, and had sat at the bedside for several hours.\r\nAt that time there were numerous parties of police and civilians\r\nsearching the country round in all directions in hopes of finding him.\r\nA verdict of wilful murder was returned against Daniel Morgan on June\r\n23rd, and a few days later a proclamation was issued by which the\r\nreward offered for his capture dead or alive was increased from £500 to\r\n£1000.\r\n\r\nA man walked into the bar of the Five Mile Creek Inn, near Bogolong,\r\nand called for a nobbler of brandy, which was supplied him. He then\r\ndemanded another, which the barman refused to give him until he had\r\npaid for the one he had drank. \"Be careful what you do,\" exclaimed\r\nthe customer, \"I'm Dan Morgan.\" He drew out a pistol, and the barman\r\nrushed from behind the counter, jumped through a window, and ran. The\r\ncustomer followed him to the window, but the barman could not say how\r\nmuch further. The barman, however, ran right round the house. When he\r\nreturned to the window through which he had made his escape, he saw\r\nthe bushranger's pistol lying on the sill. He grasped it, and having\r\nrecovered from his momentary panic, walked into the bar in time to see\r\nthe pseudo Morgan helping himself out of a bottle. The barman at once\r\ngrappled with him, and the cook, the only other man in the house at\r\nthe time, hearing the scuffling, came in. The man was soon secured,\r\nand in due time was handed over to the custody of the police. He was\r\nidentified as a fiddler, who travelled about the country playing for a\r\nliving. He was sent to gaol for a few months as a caution not to obtain\r\ngrog again under false pretences by personating a bushranger.\r\n\r\nMorgan, with three mates, visited Yarribee station, stuck up Mr. Mate,\r\nthe overseer, with two bushmen and the bullock-driver, and tied their\r\nhands behind them. He demanded the key of the store, which was given\r\nto him. He opened the door and selected a quantity of articles which\r\nhe packed on a horse. He served out tobacco, gin, and porter to the\r\nmen whom he had made prisoners, having added several, who had arrived\r\nat the station after he began operations, to their number. The liquor\r\nhad its effect, and some of the men became uproarious. Morgan swore at\r\nthem and ordered them to be quiet, and as they did not obey he brought\r\nout the station brand--P.T.--put it in the fire, and swore he would\r\nbrand every one of them on the cheek. Whether the threat frightened\r\nthe men into quietness, or whether the bushranger thought better of\r\nhis purpose, is not known. Morgan, however, rode away with his plunder\r\nwithout using the branding-iron.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading--\"Comforting Bushrangers,\" the _Deniliquin Chronicle_\r\nof the 18th December said:--\"Mr. ---- we hear has given orders that\r\nwhenever Morgan calls at his station he is to be given everything he\r\nwants, and when he does not call food is to be taken into the bush\r\nand left for him.\" The paper goes on to accuse the unnamed squatter\r\nwith \"holding a candle to the devil.\" But it is difficult to see where\r\nthe blame comes in. The stations were from twenty-five to fifty miles\r\napart, and except at lambing and shearing times had few men employed\r\non them. The police in the district were not very numerous, and even\r\nif they had been very much stronger than they were they could not have\r\nprevented a daring, reckless man like Morgan from setting fire to the\r\ngrass. It was so easy at that time for even an offended bushman to\r\nhave revenge, for any real or supposed slight or injury, by starting\r\na blaze which would destroy the grass over hundreds of square miles\r\nbefore it could be stopped, and this might go very far towards ruining\r\na squatter. In face of this danger a few clothes or a quantity of\r\nfood was a trifling loss. Certainly Morgan never did fire the grass,\r\nbecause, perhaps, there was no profit in it for himself, but there can\r\nbe no doubt that he would have done it had he desired to have revenge\r\non any particular run holder.\r\n\r\nOne of the many stories told about the brutality of Morgan was that\r\nhe went to a cattle station near Jerilderie, and asked to see the\r\noverseer. The overseer's wife informed him that her husband was away at\r\na back station mustering and branding, and that she and the children\r\nwere the only persons at home at the head station. Morgan replied\r\nthat he was sorry for it. He'd travelled to the station specially for\r\nthe purpose of shooting the overseer, who was too friendly with the\r\npolice. He then demanded a sum of money which he said he knew the\r\noverseer had recently received. The woman declared that her husband\r\nhad no money at the station, or if he had that she was not aware where\r\nhe kept it. Morgan refused to believe her. He made her boil him a\r\nnumber of eggs, declaring that he would eat nothing else, as there was\r\ntoo much strychnine and arsenic about these stations. When these were\r\nready he examined them carefully, rejecting all which had cracks in the\r\nshells and eating the sound ones only. He then made up the fire until\r\nthere was a big blaze, when he once more asked her for the money, and\r\nas she persisted in declaring that she had none he seized her by the\r\nshoulders, forced her back until she was seated on the blazing logs,\r\nand held her there until her clothes were on fire. Then he allowed her\r\nto get up, and seizing a bucket of water standing near he dashed it\r\nover her to put the fire out. Notwithstanding this she was severely\r\nburned. When he mounted and rode away he said he would soon be round\r\nagain and hoped then to find the overseer at home.\r\n\r\nSergeant Smyth and Constables Cannon, Baxter, and Reed, who were out\r\nseeking for the bushranger Morgan, camped one night in September\r\nnear Kyamba. They had put up a tent and were seated inside. They had\r\na candle and this threw their shadows on the canvas and afforded a\r\nmagnificent mark, which the bushranger could not resist firing at. The\r\nshot wounded Sergeant Smyth, but he and the constables rushed out of\r\nthe tent and blazed away, but without seeing their assailant. It was\r\nsupposed that this attack was made by Morgan, but nothing was seen of\r\nthe bushranger. Sergeant Smyth fired twice after being wounded and then\r\nhe fainted. He was taken without delay to Doodal Cooma station and a\r\ndoctor was found, but he never rallied and died a fortnight later.\r\n\r\nIt was said that Morgan was on the Wagga Wagga race course at the\r\nChristmas races, and that he had lunch at the booth where the\r\nmagistrates, the police inspectors, and the leading merchants and\r\nshopkeepers of the town went, and that afterwards he rode into the town\r\nitself without being recognised by the police.\r\n\r\nOn March 18th, 1865, he stuck up Mr. Rand's station at Mohanga,\r\ncollected all the men in one room, and ordered Mr. Rand to fetch some\r\ngrog from the store. This having been done, Morgan asked one of the\r\nmen whether he could play the concertina, and being answered in the\r\naffirmative, told him to get his instrument and \"amuse the company.\"\r\nWhen all was ready the bushranger said to Mr. Rand: \"I understand you\r\nare a good dancer. Will you favour the company with a reel?\" Mr. Rand\r\nsaid he should be only too pleased, and began at once. Morgan watched\r\nhim critically and applauded every now and then, but when Mr. Rand\r\nstopped, he raised his pistol and said: \"Once more, please, you dance\r\nvery nicely,\" and thus he kept the squatter jigging till midnight, when\r\nhe was allowed to retire. In the morning Morgan took from the store a\r\nquantity of clothing and some other articles, including a gun. He then\r\nasked for a horse, saddle, and bridle, to pack his plunder on, and got\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt Jerilderie, when engaged in one of his usual robberies, he spoke in\r\nthe most contemptuous terms of the police. He said that the Victorian\r\npolice had been blowing that they would soon catch him if he crossed\r\nthe border, and declared that he would soon show them that they were\r\nno smarter than the New South Wales police, who were \"frightened to go\r\nnear any place where they thought they might find him.\" A Beechworth\r\npaper, commenting on this report, challenged Morgan to cross the\r\nMurray, and prophesied that if he dared to do so he would be either\r\ndead or in gaol within forty-eight hours. This challenge, it was said,\r\ngave great umbrage to the bushranger, who had apparently, owing,\r\nperhaps, to his long immunity from arrest, developed the belief that he\r\nwas invincible. He was reported to have referred to it frequently, and\r\nto have asserted his intention to cross the Murray River and \"take the\r\nflashness out of the Victorian people and police.\" Accordingly, early\r\nin April, he made a raid south of the Murray. Mounted on Mr. Bowler's\r\nracing mare, Victoria, Morgan stuck up Mr. McKinnon's station on the\r\nLittle River. He crossed the King River, and set fire to Mr. Evans's\r\nbarns and granary for \"having shot my fingers off,\" an event which had\r\ntaken place some time previously, in one of his many encounters on the\r\n\"other side.\" Morgan then stuck up and robbed a number of carriers\r\non the road between Wangaratta and Benalla. He also stuck up Mr.\r\nWarby's station, and on the evening of April 8th arrived at Peechelba\r\nstation, owned by Messrs. Macpherson and Rutherford. Morgan rode up\r\nand knocked at the door of Mr. Macpherson's house. It was opened by\r\nMr. Macpherson's son. Morgan, pistol in hand, ordered him to bail up.\r\nThen everybody in the house were called in and compelled to range\r\nthemselves in line along the wall of the dining-room. A housemaid named\r\nAlice Macdonald, thinking he was joking, refused to stand up against\r\nthe wall \"like a child.\" Morgan took her by the arm to force her into\r\nline, when she smacked his face. Raising his pistol he said, \"My young\r\nlady, I must take the flashness out of you. Do you know who I am?\"\r\n\"No,\" replied the girl. \"Well, I'm Morgan. Will you take your place?\"\r\nThe girl pouted but did as she was told. Morgan placed two revolvers\r\non the table and sat down. He said he had had no sleep for three\r\nnights, but he hoped to return to New South Wales next day and have a\r\ngood sleep. He asked a servant to make him some tea and allowed her to\r\nleave the room. Then he said that he had heard music as he approached\r\nthe house, and he asked which of the ladies played? On being told\r\n\"Miss Macpherson,\" he asked her to favour him with a tune. She replied\r\n\"Certainly, Mr. Morgan.\" \"Call me Morgan,\" he said, \"I hate to be\r\nMistered.\" Mr. Macpherson asked him what had induced him to lead such a\r\nlife? \"I was forced to it,\" he replied. \"I was tried at Castlemaine for\r\na crime of which I was innocent and received a heavy sentence. Well, I\r\nescaped from the stockade and there you are. What else could I do?\"\r\n\r\nThe party sat all night, and Morgan chatted freely, but his vigilance\r\nrelaxed so that Alice Macdonald contrived to slip out without being\r\nseen and went to Mr. Rutherford's house, about a quarter of a mile\r\naway, and informed Mr. Rutherford of what had taken place. She went\r\nback again immediately in case the bushranger should miss her. Morgan\r\ninformed the company that he was born at Appin, in New South Wales,\r\nand that his parents were still living. In the meantime Mr. Rutherford\r\nmustered all the men on the station and despatched a messenger to the\r\npolice at Wangaratta. He posted sentinels all round Mr. Macpherson's\r\nhouse, hiding them behind bushes or any other cover. In the morning\r\nMorgan ate a hearty breakfast and then walked out on the verandah.\r\nMr. Macpherson invited him to take a glass of whisky and poured out\r\nsome for himself. Morgan replied that he rarely drank. He was almost\r\na teetotaller. However, not wishing to appear churlish, he accepted\r\nhalf a glass. He went into a bedroom to wash his hands and face and\r\ncomb his hair, and Alice Keenan, one of the servants, took advantage of\r\nthe opportunity to carry a can of coffee to the watchers outside. When\r\nMorgan had washed he stepped out on the verandah again and reminded\r\nMr. Macpherson that he had promised to let him have a fresh horse. Mr.\r\nMacpherson replied that he had not forgotten it. He called to his son\r\nand they walked together towards the paddock to catch the horse, while\r\nMorgan waited on the verandah. They had not gone far, however, when\r\nMorgan started to follow them, and John Quinlan shot him from behind\r\na bush. The bushranger fell, crying \"Why didn't you challenge me?\" He\r\nwas carried indoors, and every attention possible was paid to him, but\r\nhe died at about half-past one, or, as nearly as could be ascertained,\r\nforty-eight hours after he crossed the Victorian border.\r\n\r\nThe £1000 reward was divided as follows:--John Quinlan £300;\r\nAlice Macdonald £250; James Frazer, who rode into Wangaratta and\r\nback--forty-two miles--in three hours and a-half, £200; Donald Clarke,\r\nwho fetched guns from the school house, cleaned and loaded them, £100;\r\nAlice Keenan, who communicated between the parties inside and outside\r\nthe house, £50. The remaining £100 were given to Mr. Rutherford and\r\nInspector Singleton (£50 each) to be divided among the civilians and\r\nthe police who took part in the capture, according to the merits of\r\ntheir performances.\r\n\r\nThe news of the death of Morgan was received generally throughout\r\nAustralia with satisfaction. There were a few people whose love of\r\nfair play impelled them to express the opinion that he should have\r\nbeen challenged, but the majority held that he was little better\r\nthan a wild beast, and should be treated accordingly. He had given\r\nno notice to Sergeants McGinnerty and Smyth, nor to the unarmed men\r\namong whom he had fired at the Round Hill Station, and it is doubtful\r\nwhether those who declared that he should have been accorded \"fair\r\nplay\" would, knowing the character of the man, have risked their lives\r\nby challenging him in circumstances similar to those in which he\r\nwas captured. There was a tendency among a portion of the people of\r\nVictoria to glorify that colony at the expense of the mother colony\r\nover the capture of Morgan. It was said that bushrangers would never\r\nreceive the public sympathy and support in Victoria which they did in\r\nNew South Wales, and attributed this to the fact that Victoria had\r\nnever had a penal settlement within its borders. There has always\r\nbeen an absurd jealousy between the people of Melbourne and those\r\nof Sydney, and there can be no doubt that it has been somewhat of a\r\ndisadvantage to the colonies generally. In this case there is no ground\r\nfor believing that the character of the people of New South Wales,\r\nwhich was a penal colony, differs in any essential degree from that of\r\nthe people of any other portion of Australia. As a matter of fact, the\r\nAustralias are so intimately connected together,--it is so easy for\r\nthe residents of one colony to make their way into any other colony,\r\nand the people as a body are more prone to moving about than those of\r\nany other civilised country,--that any claim of superiority either in\r\nextraction, morals, or in any other particular, by the residents of any\r\none colony over those of any other colony is absurd. It is true that\r\nthere was no English penal settlement within the present bounds of the\r\ncolony of Victoria, but in former times that colony was a portion of\r\nthe penal colony of New South Wales, while the founders of Melbourne\r\ncame from another penal colony, namely, Van Diemen's Land. Many of the\r\nearly settlers were emancipated convicts from either one or the other\r\nof these penal settlements. But even if this had not been the case,\r\nthe whole population of Australia was so thoroughly intermixed during\r\nthe great rushes to the Victorian diggings that there is absolutely\r\nno excuse for any pretence of superiority on this account in this the\r\nsmallest of the colonies on the main land. I do not say this out of\r\nany ill-feeling towards Victoria, or with the desire to glorify any\r\nother colony, at her expense, but simply to point out the folly of such\r\npetty and absurd jealousies as have tended to keep the colonies apart\r\nhitherto. As a plain matter of fact South Australia is the only one of\r\nthe seven colonies which can claim not to have had a convict origin.\r\nThat colony was founded directly from England by a syndicate. All the\r\nother colonies were either portions of or were founded from New South\r\nWales, about the convict origin of which colony there can be no doubt.\r\nBut even South Australia, wedged in as it is between what have been two\r\nconvict colonies, could not escape the contagion. But, judging from\r\nthe statistics, Australia as a whole does not appear to have suffered\r\nmuch, now that the bushrangers have been disposed of. The percentage\r\nof crime in each of the colonies is lower than in most other civilised\r\ncommunities, and the \"convict colonies,\" as they were called, do not\r\nshow a higher percentage of crime than the \"free colonies.\" I have\r\nalready pointed out that the condition of Victoria, during the years\r\n1853-55, was worse than that of any of the so-called convict colonies\r\nat any time, so far as the number and ferocity of the bushrangers were\r\nconcerned, and we shall soon see that Victoria can produce native-born\r\nbushrangers as well as New South Wales. Only a few months after the\r\npoeans of self-glorification had been sung by the Victorian press over\r\nthe death of Morgan in that colony, the same papers lamented the fact\r\nthat while bushranging appeared to have been stamped out in the mother\r\ncolony, it still flourished in Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n  The Brothers Clarke; The Raid at Nerigundah; Deaths of William\r\n  Fletcher and Constable O'Grady; Murder of Four Special Constables at\r\n  Jinden; Annie Clarke at Goulburn; Capture of Thomas and John Clarke;\r\n  A Terrible Record; A Plucky Woman; An Attempt to Escape Custody;\r\n  \"Shoot Away, I Can't Stop You\"; Some Daring Robberies; Murder and\r\n  Cremation of the Brothers Pohlmann; Blue Cap.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brothers Clarke, of Manaro, although they did not belong to the\r\nGardiner gang, were more or less closely connected with it. There\r\nwere three of them, Thomas, James, and John, and their education was\r\non similar lines to that which I have described as prevalent in the\r\nWestern Ranges. They were cattle duffers and horse planters until the\r\npolice began to enquire too closely into their mode of life, when they\r\n\"took to the bush.\" James was probably saved from the more elevated\r\nfate of his elder and younger brothers by being arrested on suspicion\r\nof having been concerned with Ben Hall, Johnny Gilbert, and others in\r\nthe robbery of the Cowra mail, but as the evidence of his presence\r\non that occasion was inconclusive he was acquitted, and charged with\r\nhaving received stolen property, a number of the bank-notes stolen\r\nfrom the mail having been found in his possession. He was convicted,\r\nand was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude on January 12, 1865.\r\nHe was probably kept out of mischief during the troublous times by\r\nthis imprisonment. Thomas and John, the eldest and youngest of this\r\ninteresting family, operated over the district in which the redoubtable\r\nJackey Jackey first earned his notoriety as a bushranger, but they\r\ndid not confine their operations within any strictly defined limits,\r\nand therefore they, as it may be said, overlapped with the Hall and\r\nGilbert gang. The elder brother Thomas was arrested in October, 1864,\r\non a charge of highway robbery, but contrived to effect his escape\r\nfrom the Braidwood gaol. He stole several racehorses from residents\r\nin the neighbourhood of Jembaicumbene and Mericumbene, stuck up the\r\nAraluen mail, robbed the Post Office at Michelago, besides sticking-up\r\nand robbing numbers of travellers on the roads about Braidwood and\r\nMoruya. On January 12th, the very day on which his brother James was\r\nbeing tried, he stuck up Mr. George Summer's store at Jembaicumbene,\r\nand on the following day he bailed up John Frazer and Kenneth Matheson,\r\non Major's Creek Mount, and robbed them of £36 10s. in money, and a\r\nbank draft for a large amount. In these enterprises he was assisted by\r\nseveral young men and lads residing in the district. In April, Thomas\r\nClarke, Patrick Connell, Tom Connell, William Fletcher, and two or\r\nthree other young men were returning home from the racecourse at Bega,\r\nwhere races had been held, when Clarke stuck up a Chinaman, who was\r\ntravelling from the Gulph Diggings, and took his gold and money. A\r\nlittle farther along the road the party met the mail boy, and Clarke\r\ncompelled him to exchange his horse, saddle, and bridle for those\r\nstolen from the Chinaman. Some miles from the scene of this outrage\r\nthe party met Mr. John Emmott, and ordered him to bail up; but he,\r\nhaving a considerable amount of gold and money about him, wheeled his\r\nhorse and started to gallop away. By this time others of the party had\r\nbecome excited, and several of them chased Emmott, and fired their\r\nrevolvers at him. Emmott fell wounded and his horse was killed. About\r\n£100 in money and a parcel of gold dust was taken from him, and the\r\nparty went on, leaving Mr. Emmott to make his way to where he could\r\nobtain surgical aid as best he could. On the following day they arrived\r\nat the Gulph Diggings, stuck up Mr. Pollock's store, and stole between\r\ntwo hundred and three hundred ounces of gold, besides all the money\r\nthat they could find. On leaving the store they met Charles Nash in\r\nthe street, and Clarke greeted him with \"Hullo, Charlie, back from\r\nthe Bega races?\" \"Yes,\" replied Nash. \"Then fork out,\" cried Clarke,\r\nbringing out his revolver. Nash at first thought this was a joke, and\r\nbegan to laugh, but on the remainder of the gang crowding round and\r\npresenting their revolvers in a threatening manner he put his hand in\r\nhis pocket, took out about thirty shillings, and handed it over with\r\nthe remark, \"That's all I've got.\" He was then permitted to pass on.\r\nFletcher then led the way to the butcher's shop owned by R. Drew, and,\r\nputting his revolver to the butcher's head, told him to \"shell out.\"\r\nDrew put his hands behind him and made no reply. Then the rest of the\r\ngang crowded in and called for a light, declaring their intention to\r\nsearch the place. Drew told them to \"clear out.\" They refused, and\r\nthreatened to shoot him. The dispute grew so loud that it reached the\r\nears of Constable Miles O'Grady, the only policeman stationed on the\r\nlittle diggings, who was ill in bed. O'Grady got up and dressed, and\r\nwent to the butcher's shop. He enquired what the row was about, and\r\nordered the crowd to leave the shop. Fletcher turned round and fired\r\nat the constable, but missed. O'Grady immediately returned the fire,\r\nand Fletcher fell dead. One of Fletcher's mates then shot O'Grady,\r\nwho died a few days later. The bushrangers rushed to their horses,\r\nmounted, and galloped away out of the township. The _Moruya Examiner_\r\nsaid that William Fletcher was little more than a boy, and was born in\r\nthe district. He had ridden in the St. Patrick's Day races on March\r\n17th at Mullenderee only a few weeks before. His father was a farmer in\r\nthe district, and had always borne a good character. The boy had been\r\ndigging for gold at Araluen, Nerrigundah, The Gulph, and other diggings\r\nin that neighbourhood. It was his first essay at bushranging. His mind\r\nhad probably been inflamed by the stories told of Gardiner, Ben Hall,\r\nand Johnny Gilbert, and he had been induced to endeavour to emulate\r\ntheir actions by the boastings of Thomas Clarke. Several young men who\r\nhad taken part in this fray returned home afterwards, and were arrested\r\nby the police. Some of them were acquitted on account of their previous\r\ngood character, and because there was no evidence to prove that they\r\nhad done more than accompany the robbers. Thomas Clarke, his uncle\r\nPatrick Connell, his cousin Tom Connell, with Bill Scott and one or two\r\nothers, who escaped to the ranges, continued to commit depredations\r\nsimilar to those described in the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1866, John Carrol, Patrick Kennagh, Eneas McDonnell,\r\nand John Phegan were sent by the police authorities to the Braidwood\r\ndistrict, to assist the police in the capture of the Clarke gang.\r\nPhegan had been mining in the district and was well acquainted with\r\nthe ranges. He paid a visit to Mrs. Clarke, and was received with\r\nsome suspicion as a stranger. On his second visit Mrs. Clarke and\r\nher two daughters became quite friendly, and asked Phegan to write\r\nout a petition in favour of her second son James, who was a prisoner\r\non Cockatoo Island. The party camped as if engaged in surveying, and\r\nPhegan said that Kennagh knew more about writing out petitions than\r\nhe did. He therefore took Kennagh to the place and introduced him to\r\nMrs. Clarke. They wrote out the petition and left. During the next few\r\ndays they saw the girls frequently. In the absence of their brothers\r\nthese girls looked after the cattle, and were riding about the ranges\r\nevery day. They passed the camp several times and spoke in a friendly\r\nmanner. On the 4th of October, the party had been pretending to survey\r\na flat, and under this pretence had searched a gunyah hidden among the\r\ntimber. This gunyah was believed to be one of the rendezvous of the\r\nbushrangers, and was closely watched in the hopes that the bushrangers\r\nmight visit it. On the day named, the special constables had finished\r\ntheir work and were standing round the camp fire, when a gun was fired,\r\nand the bullet passed between the men and struck the tree against\r\nwhich the fire was built. The party had their guns ready and returned\r\nthe fire, although they could not see what they were shooting at.\r\nIn the morning a flask half full of powder was picked up, but this\r\ngave no indication as to who had attacked the party. After this no\r\npretence of friendship was made, and Carrol and the party under his\r\ncharge openly took up the pursuit of the bushrangers, penetrating the\r\nmountains and searching everywhere where they thought it probable that\r\nthe bushrangers might camp. In January, 1867, the bodies of the four\r\nmen were found near their camp on the Jinden station in the Jingera\r\nranges, in the Braidwood district. How or when they were shot is not\r\nknown, but it is supposed that they were somehow drawn into an ambush\r\nand shot down. Carrol's body was lying on its back, and a handkerchief\r\nthrown across it with a one pound note pinned to it. The bodies of\r\nCarrol and Kennagh were close together, while the other two were half\r\na mile away. Three revolvers were lying beside Phegan. One of the men\r\nhad £14 on him, and another £19. The bodies were found by Mr. Edward\r\nSmith's stockman when riding through the ranges after cattle, on the\r\n9th January, and as they were in an advanced state of decomposition,\r\nthey must have been there for several days. The Governor, Sir John\r\nYoung, immediately issued a proclamation, calling upon magistrates,\r\nfreeholders, and all other of Her Majesty's subjects, resident in the\r\npolice districts of Braidwood, Browlee, Queanbeyan, Eden, Bega, and\r\nCooma to assist the police in the capture of the \"notorious outlaw,\r\nThomas Clarke, whose life is forfeit to the laws of his country.\" The\r\nColonial Secretary, (Mr. afterwards Sir) Henry Parkes, offered a reward\r\nof £5000 for the capture of the persons guilty of murdering the four\r\nspecial constables. A free pardon was also offered to any accomplice,\r\nnot being the actual murderer. Carrol, Kennagh, and Phegan had been\r\nwarders in Darlinghurst gaol, and had volunteered to attempt the\r\ncapture of the bushranger Clarke, and McDonnell was an ex-policeman\r\nwho had accumulated a considerable sum of money in business, and was\r\nabout to visit Ireland, his native country, but who volunteered to\r\njoin this party before going home. The firing had been heard at Jinden\r\nstation, three miles from the camp, but no notice had been taken, as it\r\nwas attributed to opossum hunters. According to the medical evidence,\r\nthe men were killed with rifle bullets fired at close range--not more\r\nthan twenty yards. Phegan and McDonnell were first shot, McDonnell only\r\nhaving one wound, which was fatal. Phegan was shot in the right side,\r\nand appears to have turned over after falling, and to have been then\r\nshot on the other side to finish him. Carrol and Kennagh appear to have\r\nbeen kneeling when shot, and had perhaps surrendered. The ostentatious\r\ndisregard of the money on the bodies shows, said the _Sydney Morning\r\nHerald_, that revenge and not plunder was the object of the murderers.\r\n\r\nNo certain knowledge as to how these men came to their death has since\r\nbeen arrived at. According to rumour three of them were shot by Thomas\r\nClarke and the fourth by Bill Scott, who was afterwards wounded in a\r\nbrush with the police, and as is believed killed by Clarke, as the\r\nbushranger known as German Bill had been killed by Morgan, to prevent\r\nhim from falling into the hands of the authorities and being induced to\r\ngive evidence against his former companions. In both cases, however,\r\nthe end of the missing bushranger is uncertain.\r\n\r\nAt the Criminal Sessions, held in Goulburn in April, 1867, Thomas\r\nCunningham, Charles Hugh Gough, alias Wyndham, alias Bennett, James\r\nBaldwin, and Harry Brown were each sentenced to fifteen years'\r\nimprisonment for various acts of bushranging in various parts of the\r\ndistrict. William Johnson for robbing and shooting at a man received\r\na sentence of only two years. Several of these bushrangers came from\r\nthe neighbourhood of Braidwood, and the _Yass Courier_ reported that\r\nAnnie Clarke, one of the sisters of the bushrangers, stayed in Goulburn\r\nduring the time that the sessions lasted, her visit doubtless being one\r\nof sympathy with some of the prisoners. She was about twenty years of\r\nage, with a fine figure and good features. She was observed to change\r\nher costume four times in one day. In the morning she was very quietly\r\ndressed. Later she came out in a second costume, also very quiet and\r\nneat. But in the afternoon she walked about the streets in blood red\r\nsilk with red hat and feathers to match, and later towards evening she\r\ncame out in a bright blue silk dress, white shawl, and a hat with white\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nAt Wellington, in the same month, John Kelly was sentenced to fourteen\r\nyears' hard labour, the first two in irons, for highway robbery.\r\n\r\nAt this time the reward offered for the capture of Thomas Clarke was\r\nraised to £1000, while £500 was offered for his brother John, who had\r\njust \"turned out.\" A similar sum was offered for the capture of Bill\r\nScott, whose death had not then been ascertained, or for any other\r\nmember of the gang.\r\n\r\nOn April 26th, Senior Constable Wright, and Constables James Wright,\r\nLenehan, Walsh, and Egan, with the assistance of a black tracker\r\nknown as Sir Watkin Wynne, tracked the bushrangers to a hut not far\r\nfrom where the four special constables had been murdered. The hut or\r\ncottage stood in a small cultivation paddock in which there was a small\r\nhaystack. The constables watched the hut from behind this haystack\r\nuntil morning. At daybreak two racehorses were seen feeding behind\r\nthe hut, and Constable Walsh, making a détour round the hut so as not\r\nto be heard by the occupants, walked down and caught these horses. He\r\nwas leading them towards the haystack when the door opened and the\r\ntwo brothers Clarke came out of the house and fired at him. The other\r\ntroopers immediately rushed forward from behind the stack and summoned\r\nthe Clarkes to surrender. They made no reply, but went inside and\r\nshut the door. The police then took up positions, Constable Lenehan\r\nwith Sir Watkin stopping at the stack with the horses at about two\r\nhundred yards from the hut and nearly facing it. The Senior Constable\r\nand Constable Wright went to a fallen tree about fifty yards to the\r\nright of the hut, while Constables Egan and Walsh went to about the\r\nsame distance to the left, where there was no cover. The paddock in\r\nwhich the house stood had been recently ploughed, and the heavy rains\r\nwhich had fallen made the ground difficult to travel over. The hut was\r\nbuilt of slabs, and these had shrunk away from each other, leaving\r\ninterstices through which the bushrangers could point their guns and\r\nrevolvers. The bushrangers kept up an irregular fire until Constable\r\nWalsh was wounded in the thigh and Sir Watkin in the shoulder, when the\r\nother four troopers made a rush, forced open the door, and entered. The\r\nbushrangers surrendered. They had two revolvers, two double-barrelled\r\nguns, two revolving rifles, one single-barrelled gun, and a horse\r\npistol. The tracker's wound was so severe that he had to have his arm\r\namputated, and he bore the operation with the stoical indifference of\r\nhis race. He walked downstairs from the upper ward of the Braidwood\r\nHospital to the dissecting room, and after his arm had been cut off\r\nand the stump bound up he walked up again as coolly \"as if he had\r\nmerely had his finger punctured,\" said the _Braidwood Dispatch_.\r\nHe was supposed to be about fifty years of age, and was well-built\r\nand \"handsome for a blackfellow.\" He was promoted to the rank of\r\nsergeant-major, and had two stripes placed on his arm, of which he was\r\nvery proud. Senior Constable William Wright was made sub-inspector, and\r\nthe other constables engaged were promoted and rewarded.\r\n\r\nThomas and John Clarke were placed on trial charged with having wounded\r\nConstable Walsh and Black Tracker Sir Watkin, while in the execution\r\nof their duty. In two years Thomas Clarke had committed nine mail\r\nrobberies, and had stuck up and robbed thirty-six individuals, some\r\nof whom had been wounded. He was also suspected of having caused\r\nthe deaths of at least two persons. John Clarke had taken part in\r\ntwenty-six of these robberies. They were found guilty, and the Chief\r\nJustice--the late Sir Alfred Stephen--in his address said:--\"I\r\nnever knew a bushranger (except one who is now suffering sentences\r\naggregating thirty-two years) who made any money by it.... I will\r\nread you a list of bushrangers ... many of them young men, capable of\r\nbetter things, but who died violent deaths. Peisley executed; Davis\r\nsentenced to death; Gardiner sentenced to thirty-two years' hard\r\nlabour; Gilbert shot dead; Hall shot dead; Bow and Fordyce sentenced\r\nto death, but their sentences commuted to imprisonment for life;\r\nManns executed; O'Meally shot dead; Burke shot dead; Gordon sentenced\r\nto death; Dunleavy sentenced to death; Dunn executed; Lowry shot\r\ndead; Vane a long sentence; Foley a long sentence; Morgan shot dead;\r\nyourselves, Thomas and John Clarke, about to be sentenced to death;\r\nFletcher shot dead; Patrick Connell shot dead; Tom Connell sentenced\r\nto death, but sentence commuted to imprisonment for life; Bill Scott,\r\na companion of your own, believed to have been murdered by you....\r\nThe list shows six shot dead and ten wounded.... Unfortunately there\r\nwere seven constables shot dead and sixteen wounded in three years\r\n... since 1863.... The murders believed to have been committed by you\r\nbushrangers are appalling to think of. How many wives have been made\r\nwidows, how many children orphans, what loss of property, what sorrow\r\nyou have caused!... and yet, these bushrangers, the scum of the earth,\r\nthe lowest of the low, the most wicked of the wicked, are occasionally\r\nheld up for our admiration! But better days are coming. It is the old\r\nleaven of convictism not yet worked out, but brighter days are coming.\r\nYou will not live to see them, but others will.\"\r\n\r\nSentence was then passed in the usual form, and the brothers were hung\r\non June 25th, 1867.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile robberies were frequent in other districts. Mrs. Colonel\r\nPitt, with her daughter and Mrs. Colonel Campbell, were driving along\r\nthe Mechanics' Bay Road, near the Domain, Forbes, when a servant who\r\nwas leading the horses at the time was knocked down by an armed man.\r\nAnother robber tried to seize the reins, but Mrs. Pitt stood up in the\r\nbuggy and raised them out of his reach. She brought the butt of the\r\nwhip so heavily down on the bushranger's head that he fell. Mrs. Pitt\r\nshouted and whipped the horses, and they galloped up the hill and did\r\nnot stop until they reached Parnell, where the police were informed\r\nof what had occurred. A couple of troopers immediately started down\r\nthe road, and found the servant lying where the outrage was said to\r\nhave been perpetrated. He had been severely beaten, but was still\r\nalive. He was taken without any unnecessary delay to the hospital at\r\nForbes, where he subsequently recovered. The robbers were tracked and\r\nfollowed and were captured next day, March 5th, 1865. They were Richard\r\nMiddleton, alias Ruggy Dick, John Wilson, and Thomas Tracey. They were\r\ntried, convicted, and sent to gaol for long periods.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th a man went into Richardson's Inn, Evans' Plains, and\r\nordered those in the bar to \"bail up.\" He obtained about £5. He had\r\nbeen travelling on foot, but when he left the bar he mounted a horse,\r\nbelonging to one of the men he had robbed, and which was hitched to a\r\nverandah post, and rode straight into Bathurst, where he was captured\r\nwhile spending the money he had stolen in the bar of a public house.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th, two armed men rode up to Mr. Ryan's house, on the Burrowa\r\nRiver, and ordered Mrs. Ryan to hand out her money. She refused, and\r\none of the ruffians struck her with the butt of his revolver. An old\r\nman named Billy Dunn, who worked on the farm, jumped up from the\r\ntable where he was at dinner to protect his mistress, when the other\r\nbushranger ordered him to sit down again, adding, \"I'll shoot you if\r\nyou interfere.\" The leader again demanded the money, and Mrs. Ryan\r\nstruck him in the face, when he fired and wounded her on the knee. As\r\nshe fell he struck her again with the pistol. They ransacked the house,\r\nand at length found a roll containing £94 in bank notes, which the old\r\ncouple had just received by the Sydney mail. They also took a nugget of\r\ngold and several rings, brooches, and other articles of jewellery. The\r\nrobbers were supposed to live in the neighbourhood and to have known\r\nthat the money had been received from Sydney. They kept their faces\r\ncovered, however, and the police could not obtain a description which\r\nwould enable them to identify any persons as the robbers.\r\n\r\nThe Bathurst mail was stuck up and robbed on February 2nd, 1866, near\r\nPulpit Hill, by two young men named Seymour and John Ford, who were\r\nfollowed and captured next day.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of April, 1866, Sergeant John Healey, with Constables\r\nWilliam Raymond, Edward William Mitchell, and Andrew Kilpatrick, left\r\nBerrima in charge of eleven prisoners, whom they were to take to the\r\ngaol in Sydney. The prisoners were seated in the body of the coach,\r\nand were connected together by \"a marching chain,\" to which their\r\nhandcuffs and leg irons were attached. The police were armed each\r\nwith a short carbine and a revolver. The three constables sat in the\r\nbody of the coach with the prisoners, while the sergeant sat on the\r\nbox seat with the driver and a passenger named Whatmore. The coach\r\nstopped for change of horses at Bargo Brush, and the prisoners were\r\ntaken out of the coach into the public-house yard. One of them, Thomas\r\nBerryman, produced keys with which to unlock the handcuffs from his\r\npocket, and asked Webster, another prisoner, whether he would be one\r\nto \"rush the police.\" Webster said \"No,\" as he had only twelve months\r\nto serve, and was then threatened with vengeance if he informed the\r\npolice, and was called \"a---- hound,\" and a coward. Webster therefore\r\npromised to say nothing as to what the other prisoners proposed to do.\r\nAfter the halt the prisoners were again placed in the coach, and when\r\nthey had travelled about three miles they made a sudden and combined\r\nrush on the constables. The prisoners who engaged in this mutiny\r\nwere James Crookwell, William Lee, Thomas Berryman, John Owens, and\r\nMichael Slattery. Five others, Webster, Bland, Foster, Hindmarsh, and\r\nSmith, sat still and helped neither party. They had refused to join\r\nin the attempt at escape, but had promised not to give warning to the\r\npolice. Crookwell snatched a revolver from Constable Raymond's belt\r\nand shouted, \"Shoot the ----.\" Raymond had been seized by two of the\r\nprisoners, but he shook himself free and jumped out of the coach.\r\nSergeant Healey was also seized by some of the prisoners, who attempted\r\nto drag him backwards into the coach. He also got free and jumped\r\ndown: he ran to the side of the coach and called to the prisoners to\r\nsurrender, and as they did not do so, he pulled the trigger, but the\r\nrifle missed fire. Crookwell had got a revolver in his hand, and was\r\nstruggling with Constable Kilpatrick, and Healey made a blow at the\r\nconvict with the gun but struck an iron bar in the coach and smashed\r\nthe stock. Healey then threw away his rifle and drew his revolver. He\r\nfired and wounded Slattery, but at the same time Constable Raymond\r\nfell. Bland and Slattery were also wounded, and then the prisoners\r\ngave in. The passenger, Mr. Robert Whatmore, a publican at Bargo\r\nBrush, had got on to the coach when it left his place to go to Picton.\r\nHe had his coat torn in the struggle. When it was over he borrowed a\r\nhorse and rode to Picton for a doctor. The body of Constable Raymond\r\nand the wounded prisoners were put into the coach, and the sergeant\r\nand constables walked until they were met by the police from Picton.\r\nWhen tried, the prisoners denied having shot Constable Raymond, and\r\nsaid that he had been killed by the fire from the police guns. This,\r\nhowever, was denied by all the witnesses in the case. The six prisoners\r\nnamed were found guilty of murder, and were all sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nSergeant Grainger and Constable Carroll chased a young man on the\r\nCarcour Road on suspicion that he was a bushranger. When asked by\r\nthe sergeant where he was going, he replied, \"Looking for work.\" The\r\nsergeant made him unstrap a coat which was fastened across the pommel\r\nof his saddle, and a small revolver was found in it. \"What do you\r\ncarry that for?\" inquired the sergeant. \"For protection,\" was the\r\nreply. The sergeant then snatched away the coat and saw that the man\r\nhad a large revolver in his hand. He was told that if he attempted to\r\nraise this weapon he would be shot at once, and seeing that escape was\r\nimpossible he surrendered and allowed the police to handcuff him. Then\r\nthe sergeant opened his vest to ascertain what caused a protuberance\r\nthere, and found a pair of false whiskers and moustaches. He was\r\nidentified as John Miles, who had raided the Chinese Camp at Mookerawa,\r\nbesides committing several highway robberies on Evans' Plains and in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Orange. He was sent to gaol for ten years, the\r\nJudge saying that the prisoner had used less violence than was usual\r\nwith bushrangers, and had not ill-treated the Chinamen further than by\r\ntaking their gold.\r\n\r\nHenry Evans, a settler at Little Plains, near Burrowa, was stuck up by\r\ntwo armed men on January 7th, 1867. When asked to give up his money\r\nhe said that he had none. He never had more than a few shillings in\r\nthe house. This was disbelieved, and the bushrangers threatened to\r\ntake him out and shoot him. \"Shoot away,\" he replied coolly, \"I can't\r\nstop you.\" They tied him up and ransacked the place, breaking the\r\nfurniture and even stamping on Mrs. Evans's best bonnet. Being unable\r\nto find any money they made a bundle of some clothing and strapped it\r\non a packhorse. Evans complained that the rope with which his hands\r\nwere bound was cutting his wrists. \"Serve you right,\" exclaimed the\r\nbushranger, \"you deserve no better.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly's store on the One Mile Creek, Emu Creek Goldfield, was stuck\r\nup by John Kerr, alias Maher, and John Shepherd. Kelly, with his wife\r\nand children, and a man named Gibbons were locked up in a back room\r\nwhile the robbers were making a bundle of clothing, drapery, and other\r\narticles in the store. Gibbons, however, succeeded in forcing open a\r\nback window, without being heard by the robbers, and making his escape.\r\nHe ran to the police station and gave information, but the robbers\r\ndiscovered his escape before the arrival of the police, and decamped\r\nwithout their booty. This, however, did not save them. They were\r\nfollowed and captured by Sergeant O'Donnell and Constable McGlone.\r\nThey were convicted of more than one robbery on the Cowra Road.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday night, June 8th, Cummings, while awaiting his trial for\r\nhighway robbery, made an attempt to escape from the Bathurst Gaol. He\r\nfiled a link of the chain of his leg-irons with a small pocket knife,\r\nwhich he had somehow procured, tore up two boards from the floor of\r\nhis cell, crawled under the joists and scraped away the mortar so as\r\nto loosen several bricks in the gaol wall. The opening was only about\r\nten inches square, but he contrived to squeeze through. Of course,\r\nwhen his cell was found empty on the Sunday morning, the excitement in\r\nthe gaol was very great, but Mr. Forbes, the head gaoler, soon found\r\nthe prisoner seated in the summer house in his private garden. \"Here\r\nI am,\" cried the bushranger; \"I did my best, but could not succeed.\"\r\nThe prisoner had found some pieces of scantling in the outer yard, but\r\nthey were not long enough to enable him to reach the top of the wall\r\nwhich encloses the gaol yard. An examination into the state of the gaol\r\nshowed that the boards were quite rotten, and that the walls themselves\r\nwere not very strong, the bricks being quite soft and rotten.\r\n\r\nSeveral bullock-drivers were stuck up by John Egan and Patrick Ryan\r\non the Orange Road, in August, 1867. On the 16th Robert and John\r\nTait, father and son, and Edward Barrell were camped together when\r\nthe bushrangers rode up and ordered them to \"fork out.\" The robbers\r\ntook all their money and some articles from the drays. On the 19th\r\nthey repeated the operation on some other bullock-drivers. They\r\nwere followed by Sergeant Rush and Constable Lawrence and arrested\r\nabout forty-five miles from where the robberies were committed. At\r\nthe Bathurst Assizes the prisoners called seven witnesses to prove\r\nan alibi, but they contradicted each other under cross-examination,\r\nand on the prisoners being found guilty his Honour, Judge Hargrave,\r\ndirected that they should be prosecuted for perjury. The prisoners\r\nwere sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment. Another bushranger,\r\nJohn Foran, who was convicted on three charges, was also sentenced to\r\nfifteen years.\r\n\r\nPatrick Fitzgerald, alias Paddy Wandong, was charged at Wellington on\r\nOctober 21st, 1867, with having on the 21st December bailed up Thomas\r\nGoodall, a free selector, on the Castlereagh River. The prisoner rushed\r\ninto the house in the night and ran into the bedroom. Mr. Goodall was\r\nsitting in another room and heard his wife scream and cry \"Don't kill\r\nme.\" The prisoner, who was a half-caste, seized her by the throat\r\nand pulled her out of bed. The other man, Ted Kelly, stuck up Mr.\r\nGoodall. The prisoner said he was at Curbin, five miles away, but as\r\nhe was positively identified and was well-known in the district he\r\nwas convicted and sentenced to fifteen years' hard labour. The judge\r\nsaid that Kelly had been tried for his share in the crime and had been\r\nsentenced nearly twelve months since. Circumstances connected with\r\nbushranging had greatly altered since then, and this would naturally\r\ninduce him to be less severe; yet, having passed a sentence on one man,\r\nhe could not now pass a lighter sentence on an accomplice who was no\r\nless guilty.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of November, 1867, a party of forty or fifty shearers and\r\nothers had assembled at Mr. William Whittaker's store on the Willandra\r\nBillabong, about a mile and a half from Mossgiel station, for the\r\npurpose of holding a race meeting, when they were bailed up by John\r\nWilliams, William Brookman, Edward Kelly, and John Payne, and robbed\r\nof a considerable amount. Afterwards Michael McNamara, a constable\r\nstationed at Booligal, about sixty miles from Mossgiel, but who was\r\nat Mossgiel on duty at the time, was talking to Mr. Dobbins on the\r\nverandah of the store, when Williams and Brookman came up, and asked\r\nDobbins if he was Constable McNamara. Dobbins replied \"No.\" Brookman\r\nthen turned to the constable and asked him the same question. The\r\nbushrangers each had a revolver in his hand, and so the constable\r\nalso said \"No,\" and made a rush at Brookman. In the struggle they got\r\ninside the store, and Brookman's pistol exploded, the bullet shattering\r\nMcNamara's wrist. Brookman was shouting for help, and another shot\r\nwas fired, wounding Constable McNamara in the back of the head. Mr.\r\nPeerman, overseer of the Mossgiel sheep station, and Mr. Edward Crombie\r\nrushed up and secured Williams and Brookman, who were placed in a\r\nhut and watched by Messrs. F.G. Desailly, Robertson, and others. The\r\ntwo bushrangers had five revolvers all loaded, except two barrels\r\nwhich had recently been fired. Williams had £82 1s. 10d. and Brookman\r\n£34 8s. 8d., making in all £116 10s. 6d. The two bushrangers were\r\ncharged on January 14th, 1868, at Deniliquin, with having wounded\r\nwith intent to kill Michael McNamara, a constable in the execution\r\nof his duty. Williams, it was said, was a bullock driver, who had\r\nrecently sold his team for the purpose of turning bushranger. Brookman\r\nwas under seventeen years of age, and very boyish in appearance. Mr.\r\nGeorge Milner Stephen, who appeared for the prisoners, pleaded hard\r\nfor a light sentence on Brookman on account of his youth, and also\r\nbecause his family were respectable people. The Chief Justice said\r\nthat in a recent case of a bushranger who put a pistol to the head of\r\nan advancing constable, the jury had found that there was no intent\r\nto kill, for what reason no one could tell. In the present case the\r\narresting constable had not been killed, and the jury must decide as to\r\nthe intent. With regard to the youth of one of the prisoners, it was\r\nan ascertained fact that lads when they became bushrangers were more\r\nbloodthirsty, brutal, cruel, and fiendish than grown men. The prisoners\r\nwere sentenced to death, and the boy when he heard the sentence said\r\n\"Thank you.\" His sentence was afterwards commuted to imprisonment for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nEdward Kelly and John Payne pleaded guilty to the robberies at\r\nWhittaker's, and to two other charges of bushranging. They had been\r\nfollowed by the police, and Payne was captured while Kelly got away,\r\nbut not without a wound. Subsequently Payne led the police to the camp,\r\nand thus assisted them to capture his wounded mate. For this act of\r\nhumanity, the judge sentenced him to ten years' imprisonment on two\r\ncharges, the sentences to be concurrent; while Kelly was sentenced to\r\ntwo terms of fifteen years each, or thirty years in all.\r\n\r\nWalter Maher, another bushranger, also pleaded guilty to a charge of\r\nhighway robbery, and was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nCharley Johnson and Miller, alias Slater, who had been arrested and\r\nlodged in the lock-up at Denison Town, on April 3rd, 1868, made a rush\r\non the watch-house keeper when he entered their cell, knocked him\r\ndown and took his revolver. They fired two shots at him and walked\r\naway. They called at the blacksmith's shop and made the blacksmith take\r\noff their irons. Then they left the town, to resume their bushranging\r\ncareer. On the following morning they stuck up and robbed Mr. Ashton of\r\nabout £10. On the 6th they stuck up the Green Swamp Inn, kept by Mr.\r\nMcNaughton. In the evening they walked into Mr. Tuckerman's Hotel, in\r\nMudgee, and called for drinks. When these had been served they ordered\r\nall in the bar to bail up, and began collecting the money. When they\r\nhad obtained all they could they walked away, no attempt being made\r\nto detain them. They went into Langbridge's hotel, and collected the\r\nmoney in the same way. Then they returned, mounted their horses, and\r\nleft the town by the Green Swamp Road. They stopped for supper at\r\nLandell's Hotel, about a mile from the town. In the meantime a party\r\nunder Constable Campbell, composed principally of those who had been\r\nrobbed, started in pursuit. They rode rapidly, and as they came up to\r\nthe front of Landell's Hotel the bushrangers left by the back door,\r\nthe horses they had ridden being captured, as they were hitched to\r\nthe verandah. On the following morning Mr. Farrar was returning from\r\nGulgong to Mudgee when he saw three mounted men, whom he took to be\r\nbushrangers. He started to gallop away, when he recognised Constable\r\nWebb's voice, and pulled up. He informed the police that he had stayed\r\nat Matthew Horner's Inn on the previous night, and had been suddenly\r\nwakened by a blow on the head from the butt of a revolver. He was\r\nordered to keep quiet and to get up. He did so, and was compelled to\r\nlead the way to the stable, saddle and bridle his horse, and give the\r\nanimal to the bushrangers. He had no idea who they were, and had been\r\ntoo much confused by the blow on his head to notice their appearance.\r\nThey afterwards roused up Mr. Horner and compelled him to supply them\r\nwith horses, giving Farrar his horse back again. On obtaining this\r\ninformation the party in pursuit rode on to Horner's Inn to make\r\nfurther enquiries, while at the same time the bushrangers must have\r\nbeen riding through the bush to Mudgee, and so passed their pursuers.\r\nThey called at Tuckerman's Hotel, and had breakfast. As soon as their\r\npresence in the town was known, another party was made up to capture\r\nthem. When the bushrangers left the town they were again followed, and\r\nwere overtaken near Bambera Hill, where a fight took place, but when\r\nthe pursuers had expended all their ammunition they returned to Mudgee,\r\nwhile the bushrangers proceeded to stick up and rob the Barragon mail.\r\nThey were captured subsequently, and sent to gaol.\r\n\r\nThe murder of the brothers Pohlmann, hawkers, was reported in the\r\n_Wagga Wagga Express_ of April 11th, 1868. The hawker's waggon had\r\nbeen found standing a little off the road which runs along the bank of\r\nthe Yanco Creek from Narrandera to Jerilderie. A few yards away was a\r\ngunyah of boughs and bushes, supposed to have been constructed by the\r\nbrothers to shelter their camp fire from the wind. Not far away were\r\nthe ashes of a large fire, and on this being carefully examined some\r\nmetal buttons and remains of charred bones furnished incontrovertible\r\nevidence that some human being had been cremated there. The drawers and\r\nlockers with which the waggon was provided were open and had evidently\r\nbeen ransacked. The clothes and drapery were disarranged and scattered\r\nabout the waggon, while of the large stock of jewellery which the\r\nbrothers were known to carry with them nothing could be found. When\r\nthe report was first published a rumour spread around that one of the\r\nbrothers had murdered the other and had made off with the more valuable\r\narticles. A sister, who resided in Sydney, wrote to the Press stating\r\nher opinion that this was not true. Her brothers were too fond of each\r\nother to quarrel, and as they had been very successful there was no\r\nmotive for the robbery. She added that there was a secret receptacle in\r\nthe axle bed of the waggon known only to herself and her brothers, and\r\nit was their custom to carry their money and the most valuable articles\r\nof jewellery in this _cache_. She felt certain that if the police\r\nsearched they would find this secret hiding place with its contents\r\nintact. The police did search, and found £73, some gold watches, and\r\nother valuables hidden as Miss Pohlmann declared they would be. This\r\neffectually disproved the rumour about one brother having murdered the\r\nother, and made it evident that both had been murdered. A number of\r\nsuspicious characters were arrested and discharged, and it was thought,\r\nas time passed away, that this murder would have to be included among\r\nthe many undiscoverable crimes. Two years had elapsed, and the murder\r\nwas almost forgotten, when a man named Robert Campbell was arrested\r\nand charged with the crime. One witness said he had been camped on the\r\nsand hill near the Yanco Creek, on March 13th, 1868. This sand hill was\r\na favourite camping ground, because there was plenty of scrub on it,\r\nand there was no timber for firewood for miles on either side. He had\r\njust finished his supper when Campbell came up and asked him to take\r\nsome tea to his mate who was lying ill about a quarter of a mile away.\r\nWitness told him he could take the tea himself, but he refused. The\r\nreason why witness would not take the tea was because Campbell bore a\r\nbad character. Campbell went away, and witness removed his camp some\r\ndistance away, as he believed that Campbell was \"up to some mischief.\"\r\nThe following morning, soon after he resumed his journey, he met the\r\nPohlmanns going towards the camping ground. No one could be found who\r\nhad seen the Pohlmanns after this, and the evidence as to the time when\r\nthey left Gillenbah tallied with the time when they were seen by this\r\nwitness. The police succeeded in tracing some of the jewellery which\r\nhad belonged to the Pohlmanns, and which Campbell had sold. He was\r\nconvicted of murder, and was hung on October 5th, 1870, but as he made\r\nno confession the manner in which he carried out his crime can never be\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nOn April 20th, 1868, Robert Cotterall, alias Blue Cap, was tried at\r\nWagga Wagga for having stuck up and robbed Carl Seeman at Rock Station,\r\nReedy Creek, in June, 1867; and William Marshall, Jeremiah Lehane, and\r\nseveral others at various places, between July 15th and October 24th.\r\nThe prisoner had made a hard struggle when run down by the police, and\r\nhad been wounded. He was still very ill when brought to trial. He was\r\ndeathly pale, and wore a green shade over his eyes. He looked very\r\nlittle like the popular ideal of a bold bushranger. He was convicted\r\nand sent to gaol for ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n  Bushranging in the Northern District of New South Wales; Captain\r\n  Thunderbolt Robs the Toll Bar; A Chinaman Bushranger; A Long Chase;\r\n  A Fight with the Police; \"Next, Please\"; The Bushranger Rutherford;\r\n  Captain Thunderbolt and the German Band; Desperate Duel between\r\n  Captain Thunderbolt and Constable Walker; Thunderbolt's Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that while the Southern and Western districts\r\nof New South Wales were harried by bushrangers, that the great Northern\r\ndistrict escaped from this scourge. As a fact, although bushranging\r\nbegan rather later than in the Western district, the Northern district\r\nwas in no degree behind the others in interest at this time. In April,\r\n1864, Peter, James, and Acton Clarke, three brothers, with John Conroy\r\nand a boy of twelve, named Samuel Carter, were riding together towards\r\nCulgoa, near Warland's Range. The boy had cantered some distance ahead,\r\nwhen he was ordered to \"bail up\" by a mounted man, who suddenly came\r\nout from behind a clump of trees. The boy took no notice and the man\r\nfired at him and missed. The boy galloped away and the man started to\r\nfollow him, when he caught sight of the other travellers, who had just\r\nappeared round a bend in the road. The bushranger stopped his horse,\r\nturned to meet them, and ordered them to dismount. They did so. The\r\nbushranger also dismounted and came towards them. He demanded their\r\nmoney, and they felt in their pockets to get it out. Just then Peter\r\nClarke made a rush, threw his arms round the bushranger, and tried to\r\nthrow him. There was a short struggle, and a pistol went off. Peter\r\nClarke fell dead, and the bushranger broke away from him. The other\r\ntravellers had come forward and endeavoured to assist Peter, but had\r\nbeen unable to grasp hold of the bushranger, as the wrestlers shifted\r\nso rapidly. Now, however, they caught him as he was trying to reach his\r\nhorse. In the struggle both James Clarke and Conroy were wounded, but\r\nthe bushranger was overpowered and disarmed. They tied his arms and\r\ntook him along with them. About two miles along the road they came upon\r\ntwo men tied to trees, who said that they had been stuck up and robbed\r\nby the prisoner about two hours before. The prisoner was handed over to\r\nthe police, and was identified as Harry Wilson, twenty years of age. He\r\nwas taken to Maitland and charged with wilful murder. He was convicted,\r\nand hung on October 4th. A public meeting was held at Murrurundi and\r\na committee was appointed to raise a subscription for the purpose of\r\nerecting a monument to Peter Clarke, who had \"sacrificed his life in\r\nthe cause of order and justice.\" This project was duly carried out.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Turner, travelling from Bingera Goldfield to Newcastle in\r\na buggy, put up for the night at Britten's Hotel, Willowtree. Next\r\nmorning (Sunday, October 19th) he started early, intending to breakfast\r\nat Wallabadah. He had gone barely ten miles, however, when he was\r\nstuck up by a man riding a fine-looking horse. The robber took him off\r\nthe road, tied him to one tree and hitched his horse to another. He\r\nrobbed Mr. Turner of about £12, a gold watch and chain, and a bunch of\r\nkeys, and rode away. Mr. Turner struggled desperately and succeeded in\r\ngetting loose. He was leading his horse through the scrub towards the\r\nroad when the robber returned, tied him up more securely than before,\r\nand cautioned him not to \"try that dodge again.\" This time Mr. Turner\r\nremained quiet, and about an hour later the bushranger returned again,\r\ndirecting Mr. McShane where to drive his mail coach. When the coach\r\nhad been placed in a satisfactory position the robber tied McShane and\r\na passenger back to back, with a sapling between them, and laid them\r\non the ground. The bushranger then sat down to go through the letters.\r\nMcShane said, \"You'd better leave them alone, you'll get nothing out\r\nof them.\" \"Won't I,\" replied the bushranger. \"What do you call this?\r\nIt's a hundred and forty quid anyway.\" He held up a roll of bank\r\nnotes as he spoke. Having finished the letters he told them to remain\r\nquiet until he \"got the other mail,\" and went away again towards the\r\nroad. It was fully two hours later when he again returned, directing\r\nSmith, the driver of the other mail, where to drive. Smith said his\r\nhorses were young ones and would not stand. \"All right,\" replied the\r\nbushranger, \"stand at their heads, but, mind, no hanky panky.\" The\r\nonly passenger was Mrs. O'Dell. She was politely requested to take a\r\nseat on a log and was not interfered with or asked for her money. By\r\na strange coincidence her husband had been a passenger on the coach a\r\nweek before and had been robbed at the same place, presumably by the\r\nsame bushranger. By the present transaction the Bank of New South Wales\r\nlost £274, and it was doubtful whether this included the \"hundred and\r\nforty quid\" or not.\r\n\r\nJ. Lowe's mail coach, plying between Mudgee and Sofala, was stuck up\r\nby an armed bushranger about two miles from Peel. It was not known\r\nwhether this highwayman came from the Northern or the Western district,\r\nthe place where the robbery took place lying between the two and being\r\nraided occasionally from either side.\r\n\r\nOn December 16th a toll-keeper named Delany was \"sitting at the\r\nreceipt of custom\" in the toll-house on the road between Maitland and\r\nRutherford, when a man pushed the door open, presented a pistol at\r\nhis head, and cried out \"Give me your money.\" Delany was of course\r\nconsiderably startled by the suddenness of this attack, but he replied\r\n\"I've got none.\" \"No---- nonsense!\" cried the bushranger. \"Give it\r\nhere!\" \"I tell you,\" exclaimed Delany, \"there's no money here. My\r\nmate's just taken it to Maitland.\" The bushranger stepped into the\r\nhouse, pushed Delany aside, opened the cupboard, and took out the cash\r\nbox, saying at the same time, \"I'm Captain Thunderbolt.\" Delany made no\r\nattempt to resist this violence, and the bushranger put the box under\r\nhis arm and walked away up the road to where he had hitched his horse\r\nto the fence. He mounted and rode away, and a few minutes afterwards\r\nO'Brien, the lessee of the tollbar, returned from the town. Delany told\r\nhim what had occurred, and leaving O'Brien in charge walked towards\r\nthe Spread Eagle Inn at the Rutherford Racecourse. Near the inn he\r\ncame upon the bushranger, who exclaimed, \"Hulloa, come after me?\" \"No,\"\r\nreplied Delany, \"I'm going to the pub.\" \"Has your mate gone for the\r\ncrushers?\" asked the bushranger. \"No,\" was the reply, \"he's minding the\r\nbar.\" Captain Thunderbolt kept silence for a moment, as if thinking,\r\nthen he said, \"I was told that young Fogarty, the flash fighting man,\r\nwas keeping the bar, and I wanted to take it out of him. I didn't want\r\nto hurt you. You'll find your cash box behind that clump of trees and\r\nhere's your money.\" He handed Delany about four shillings, mostly in\r\ncoppers, and Delany walked away, picked up the cash box, which was\r\nuninjured, and went back to the toll-house. The bushranger walked into\r\nthe bar of the inn and asked if he could have something to eat. Mrs.\r\nByrne, the landlady, replied \"Certainly,\" and went out to cut him some\r\nbread and meat. He sat down and waited, and on her return ate the bread\r\nand meat as if he was very hungry. When he had finished he asked \"How\r\nmuch?\" \"Oh nothing,\" replied Mrs. Byrne, \"we never charge for a little\r\nthing like that.\" \"Well,\" said the robber, \"I came here to stick you\r\nup, but as you're so---- hospitable, I won't.\" He then asked for a\r\nbottle of rum, paid for it, and went away. About half-a-mile away he\r\nmet Godfrey Parsons, who was taking his sick wife to Maitland, to see\r\nthe doctor. Thunderbolt ordered him to \"bail up and hand out.\" Parsons\r\nreplied, \"We've only two pounds, and we want that for the doctor.\" The\r\nbushranger asked what was the matter with Mrs. Parsons and how long\r\nshe had been ill. Parsons told him. \"Well,\" said the robber, \"I'm a\r\nbushranger, but I don't rob sick women; pass on.\" Mrs. Parsons had £30\r\nin her pocket and was crying at the prospect of losing it.\r\n\r\nFurther along the road Thunderbolt met a man and four women, and\r\nstopped to joke with them. He said he thought it----- unfair that one\r\nman should have four women, while he could not get one. As they were\r\nlaughing a trooper rode up, and the bushranger immediately challenged\r\nhim to fight; the trooper, however, said he had no ammunition with\r\nhim. \"I've been chased by you---- traps near Armidale,\" exclaimed\r\nThunderbolt, \"but they pulled up at the Black Rock. They were afraid\r\nof getting bogged in the Green Swamp if they followed me.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped a number of other people during the afternoon, robbing some\r\nand letting others go, and in the evening went back to the Spread Eagle\r\nto tea. He chatted for some time with Mrs. Byrne, telling her of his\r\nexploits. Just after his departure four troopers rode up. Information\r\nas to the proceedings of the bushranger had reached Maitland, and these\r\ntroopers had been sent out to catch him if possible. They made some\r\nenquiries, and then followed in the direction in which Thunderbolt had\r\ngone, overtaking him as he was talking quietly to a man on the road.\r\nThe foremost trooper presented his pistol at the bushranger's head,\r\nand said \"You're my prisoner.\" \"Am I?\" cried Thunderbolt with a laugh,\r\nas he put spurs to his horse and galloped away. After a long chase,\r\nand the expenditure of a large quantity of Government ammunition, the\r\nbushranger escaped in the dark, the troopers' horses being almost too\r\ntired to return to Maitland. In its comments on this escapade of the\r\nnew bushranger the _Maitland Mercury_ enquires: \"Is this hitherto quiet\r\ndistrict to be disturbed as the Western district has been for so long a\r\ntime?\" and events proved that it was.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days the Northern mail was stuck up by two armed men. One\r\nof the robbers was said to be in a state of trepidation the whole time.\r\nPerhaps this may account for the bushrangers missing two registered\r\nletters, one containing £60 and the other £30, and a small bag of\r\ngold-dust in a package. A gentleman who was accompanying the mail cart\r\non horseback was allowed to continue his journey because he said he\r\nwas on a visit to a sick friend. He was required to promise, \"as a\r\ngentleman,\" not to give any information to the police, and he kept his\r\nword, but on his arrival in Tamworth he made a bet that the mail coach\r\nwould not arrive by three p.m. The mail was delayed less than half an\r\nhour, however, and the driver nearly made up the lost time by fast\r\ndriving. The gentleman therefore lost his bet in spite of the special\r\nknowledge he had acquired. The robbers were followed at once, and on\r\nJanuary 6th, 1865, William Mackie and Robert Johnstone were committed\r\nfor trial for this robbery. Mackie was identified as a bushranger\r\nwho had been previously convicted at Bathurst for robbery under arms,\r\nbut had made his escape while being conveyed to Sydney to be sent to\r\nCockatoo Island. The prisoners were taken from Bathurst to Penrith by\r\ncoach. From thence they went to Sydney by train. They were handcuffed\r\nin the guard's van, the door being open, as the day was very hot.\r\nWhen running along the embankment near Fairfield, between Liverpool\r\nand Parramatta, Mackie, ironed as he was, jumped out. The train was\r\ntravelling at a fast rate, and it ran some distance before notice could\r\nbe conveyed to the driver and the train stopped. It was expected that\r\nthe prisoner would be found dead at the foot of the embankment, but\r\nnothing could be seen of him. It was then believed that he had crawled\r\nsomewhere into the scrub to die, but although diligent search was made\r\nno body could be discovered. He was now sent to Cockatoo to undergo his\r\noriginal sentence, and Johnstone was sent to keep him company. It was\r\nsaid that they intended to join Captain Thunderbolt.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to stick up the Northern mail about twelve miles\r\nnorth of Singleton, on January 7th. A shot was fired from behind a\r\nculvert on the road, as the coach was passing, and a voice called out\r\n\"Bail up.\" The driver, however, instead of obeying, lashed his horses,\r\ntook his foot off the brake, and the coach plunged down the hill at a\r\ntremendous rate, and at the imminent risk of a capsize. Two robbers\r\ncame out from behind the culvert and fired. The passengers declared\r\nthat they heard the whizz of the bullets, but no one was hurt, and the\r\ncoach reached the level ground safely.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the branch mail from Bendemeer was stuck up and robbed\r\nnear Stringy Barks, proving that more than one party was raiding on the\r\nGreat North Road. There were no passengers, but a number of half notes\r\nwere taken. The robbers handed the driver several cheques to \"take care\r\nof,\" one being for £1000. No violence was used.\r\n\r\nThe Northern mail was robbed again on January 30th, at Black Hill,\r\nabout two miles from Muswellbrook, by four armed men. There were three\r\nmale and one female passengers. The amount stolen was estimated at\r\nbetween £700 and £800. These and several minor robberies on the road\r\nwere all credited to Captain Thunderbolt, or to men who were trying to\r\njoin him, and it was said that the immunity enjoyed by him encouraged\r\nother evil-disposed persons to take to the road.\r\n\r\nIn one case at least a Chinaman turned bushranger. Constable Ward was\r\nreturning to his station at Coonanbarabran from Mudgee, on February\r\n21st, when he was informed that a Chinaman had recently stuck up and\r\nrobbed a number of persons in the neighbourhood. The constable followed\r\nhim into the bush, found his camp, and called on the Asiatic to come\r\nout and surrender. Instead of obeying the Chinaman exclaimed, \"You----\r\npoliceeman, me shootee you!\" and did so. The constable, though wounded,\r\nreturned to the nearest farm, from whence news of the occurrence was\r\nsent to the police-station. A party was organised and the Chinaman was\r\nsoon hunted down. He was convicted of attempting to murder a constable\r\nwhile in the execution of his duty, and was hung. Constable Ward\r\nrecovered from his wound.\r\n\r\nOn April 6th, Mr. Hughes, of Bourke & Hughes, squatters, informed the\r\npolice at Dubbo, that the hotel at the Fisheries had been stuck up and\r\nrobbed, and volunteered to assist in the capture of the bushrangers.\r\nThey tracked the robbers to Canonbar, about a hundred and twenty miles,\r\nwhen Mr. Hughes's horse knocked up. There they were informed that the\r\nbushrangers had passed three days before, and had stolen fresh horses\r\nfrom Mr. Baird's station, Bellerengar, leaving their knocked-up ones\r\nin exchange. The black trackers were thrown off the trail by this\r\nmanoeuvre, as they followed the tracks of the abandoned horses for\r\nseveral miles before they discovered their error. They soon, however,\r\npicked up the new tracks, although the bushrangers had kept off the\r\nroad as much as possible, as if aware that they were being followed.\r\nThey rode through the scrub and across arid or rocky patches wherever\r\nthey could find them, but the black boys followed them with unerring\r\nskill and with but little delay. The bush rangers stuck up and robbed\r\nseveral people on the road and took fresh horses, provisions, and\r\nother necessaries from the stations as they went along. At Martell's\r\nInn the police were informed that the bushrangers were only twelve\r\nhours ahead. We will now leave the pursuers and see what the pursued\r\nwere doing. They stuck up Mr. Strahan's station and then went on to\r\nGordon's Inn, where they called for drinks like ordinary travellers,\r\nshouting for all those in the bar. Then the leader, Daniel Sullivan,\r\nproduced his pistol, while his two mates went to the door to prevent\r\nany of the men inside from running away. They collected about £4 from\r\nthe landlord and those in the bar, then they put their pistols in their\r\npockets and began \"shouting\" again. When the £4 was expended, they\r\nagain produced their pistols, compelled the landlord to hand over the\r\ncash, and proceeded to spend it as before. The money had been expended\r\nsome three or four times, when Sullivan left his mates, Clarke and\r\nDonnelly, to \"keep the game alive,\" mounted his horse and rode into\r\nthe bush. Mr. Gordon was compelled to remain in the bar to serve out\r\nthe liquors called for, but Mrs. Gordon went on to the verandah to\r\nascertain whether she could find any one to send to Molong to give\r\nthe alarm. Presently she saw three dusty, weather-stained travellers\r\nwalking towards the inn, and thought that they were more bushrangers.\r\nFortunately she did not go into the bar to tell her husband, and when\r\nSergeant Cleary, with Constables Brown and Johnston, came up they\r\nspeedily told her who they were, and were informed in their turn that\r\nthe men they had ridden so far to arrest were inside. The police\r\nentered the bar, and covering the two bushrangers with their revolvers\r\ncalled on them to surrender. Instead of obeying, Clarke put his hand\r\nto his belt and was immediately shot. Donnelly made a rush towards\r\nthe corner of the bar, where their guns were standing against the\r\nwall, and he also was shot just before he reached them. A moment later\r\nSullivan rode up to the front of the hotel, unconscious of the change\r\nwhich had taken place during his absence, and when he found himself\r\ncovered by the police weapons he was so dumbfounded that he permitted\r\nhimself to be pulled from his horse and handcuffed without resistance.\r\nThe police had left their horses some distance away in charge of the\r\nblack tracker. Now they went for their horses and fed them as well as\r\nthemselves. Later on a cart was procured, and the body of Donnelly\r\nwas disposed in the bottom. Beside it, wrapped in a blanket, was the\r\nwounded man, Clarke, while Sullivan, being uninjured, was mounted on\r\nhorseback, and the whole party proceeded to Molong, where an inquest\r\nwas held on Donnelly's body. Sullivan, and Clarke, who recovered from\r\nhis wound, were subsequently tried and convicted.\r\n\r\nOn April 29th, the _Tamworth Examiner_ said:--\"A week ago we reported\r\nthat Frederick Ward, alias Captain Thunderbolt, had stuck up the\r\nWarialda mail. He afterwards went to Mr. Lloyd's Manilla station and\r\ntook two first-class horses. Then he stuck up Cheeseborough's and\r\nLethbridge's stations. From the 20th to the 24th nothing was heard of\r\nhim, but on the last-mentioned date he and another stuck up Munro's\r\nInn, at Boggy Creek. Mr. Munro challenged them to fight singly, either\r\nwith fists or pistols, but they laughed at him and shot a valuable dog.\r\nThey drank a large quantity of spirits, and collected between £70 and\r\n£80. They went on to Walford's Inn at Millie, sticking up Mr. Baldwin\r\non the road. Mr. Walford, having been informed of their approach, had\r\nhidden away everything of value, so that they got very little, except\r\nmore grog. The police also had been informed, and three troopers,\r\nwith a black tracker, soon arrived on the scene. As they approached,\r\nthe bushranger on guard outside whistled, and the other man came out\r\nand mounted, Thunderbolt waving a revolver and pointing to a field\r\nbehind the house as a challenge. He led his men to the clearing and\r\nmade a stand. The police followed, and a number of shots were fired\r\non both sides. The police closed up, and Constable Dalton shot one of\r\nthe bushrangers, a mere lad, and he fell. Dalton shouted to Constable\r\nMorris to 'look after him,' and turned towards Thunderbolt, when the\r\nboy raised himself on his elbow and fired. Constable Lynch shot the boy\r\nin the neck, probably in time to save Dalton's life. Ward made a dash\r\nforward, perhaps with a view to driving the police away from the boy\r\nand carrying him off, but the police fire was too brisk, and after a\r\nfew more rounds the robber turned and rode into the bush. The police\r\nfollowed, but as their horses had travelled fifty miles that morning,\r\nthey were obliged to give up the chase. The robber who was killed, was\r\nidentified as John Thompson, aged sixteen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Namoi mail was robbed by one white man and two blacks, near\r\nTamworth, and on September 17th the mail from Walgett to Singleton was\r\nstuck up at Brigalow Creek. The passengers and driver were conducted\r\nsome distance off the road, to where a fire had been kindled, and were\r\ntold to \"make some tea and enjoy yourselves while we look after the\r\nbags.\" James Boyd, alias McGrath, and Charles Stanmore were arrested\r\nafter a smart chase, and were convicted of having robbed the Walgett\r\nmail. A number of similar robberies occurred from time to time in\r\nvarious parts of this extensive district, and the police were kept\r\nconstantly busy.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1865, Ward, riding Mr. Duff's racer Eucalyptus, stuck up\r\nCook's Inn at Quirindi on the 18th; J.M. Davis's Inn at Currabubula on\r\nthe 20th, and Griffin's Inn at Carroll on the 23rd. At this last-named\r\nplace he pulled up, and said to his mate in a loud voice, \"Let's have\r\na glass of brandy. We want it this wet evening.\" They dismounted, and\r\nstepped on to the verandah. As he entered the door Thunderbolt raised\r\nthe corner of his mackintosh to display his pistols, and said, \"I'll\r\ntrouble you, ladies and gentlemen, to bail up.\" The women began to\r\nscream, and Ward said, \"Don't be afraid. We shan't hurt any one. We\r\nonly want a little money.\" A traveller who had entered some time before\r\ndrew away from the bar, and joined the bushrangers. The other men\r\npresent were ranged in single row along the wall, and when all were in\r\nposition each man was called up in turn to be searched. The proceedings\r\nwere very suggestive of the \"next, please,\" in a barber's shop. While\r\nthis was going on several people entered, and were compelled to take\r\ntheir places at the end of the queue. The bushrangers held the bar\r\nfrom five to nine p.m., pausing in their work every now and then to\r\norder drinks for all hands. Shortly after nine o'clock two men rode up\r\nto the verandah, and shouted \"Landlord.\" The robbers looked out, and\r\nrecognising the horsemen, retreated into the back room. Mr. Griffin\r\nwent to the door, and said in a low tone to Constable Lang, \"We're\r\nall stuck up here.\" \"Which are the bushrangers?\" asked the constable,\r\nand on being told that they were in the back room he rode to the door\r\nand fired. The shot was returned, and the shooting continued until\r\nthe constable was wounded in the arm and his horse in the neck. The\r\nbushrangers went out through the back door, and escaped in the darkness\r\ninto the bush, but they left their horses behind.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1866 Ward and his gang made a raid across the Queensland\r\nborder, robbing stations, hotels, and travellers in the Curriwillinghi\r\ndistrict, but he soon returned to his own district, and in March the\r\nTamworth and Wee Waa mail was stuck up near Bullingall by two armed\r\nmen supposed to be Ward and another. The driver of the Northern mail\r\nwas also ordered to bail up near Murrurundi, and as he did not obey\r\nwith due alacrity he was speedily brought to a standstill by one of his\r\nhorses being shot dead. After going through the letters the bushrangers\r\nrode into the town and took a quantity of clothes, some money, and some\r\njewellery and other valuables from Barton's and Johnstone's stores and\r\nHumphries' Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe Northern mail was robbed by three armed men at the Red Post Hill,\r\nnear Falbrook. It was just before dawn when the driver was ordered to\r\nbail up. The robbers were on foot and had a number of pieces of rope\r\nready to tie up the passengers. Mr. Moore, of Abingdon, attempted to\r\nrun away, but was followed and knocked down with the butt of a pistol.\r\nThe six passengers and the driver were tightly bound either to the\r\nfence or to trees, and their money and watches taken away from them.\r\nThe robbers then mounted the coach and drove away along the road.\r\nAs soon as it was out of sight the bound men began to struggle for\r\nliberty. Mr. Moore was the first to succeed in breaking loose and he\r\nuntied Mr. Dines and the others. They followed the coach along the road\r\ntowards Singleton, but had not gone very far when they were overtaken\r\nby Mr. Wyndham on horseback. They informed him of their circumstances\r\nand he rode rapidly away to give notice to the police in Singleton. He\r\nfound the coach standing on the road within a mile of the town but did\r\nnot stay to examine it. The police started out immediately and arrived\r\nat the coach almost as soon as the driver and passengers. Only one of\r\nthe bags had been cut open, and no damage was done to anything else on\r\nthe coach. The police spent the whole day in searching, but failed to\r\nfind any tracks or to ascertain in which direction the robbers had gone.\r\n\r\nJames Booth, William Willis, alias Dunkley, and Thomas Hampton were\r\narrested in a public house at the corner of Goulburn and Pitt Streets,\r\nSydney, by Detectives Camphin and Finigan on April 17th, 1866, and\r\ncharged with having robbed the Singleton mail on the previous day.\r\nThe coach had arrived at the Red Post Hill, between Muswellbrook and\r\nSingleton, when the men sprang out from behind the trees bordering the\r\nroad and sang out, \"Bail up, stand and deliver, throw up your arms.\"\r\nMr. Moore, one of the passengers, jumped out of the back of the coach,\r\nand Hampton chased him and brought him back. Mr. Button, a Government\r\nrailway guard, also tried to get down, but Willis told him that he\r\nwould blow his \"---- brains out\" if he didn't sit still. The passengers\r\nwere all tied up and robbed. One of them, George Beved, said that\r\nWillis was the man who threatened to \"Blow the roof of his---- skull\r\noff\" when Moore was wrestling with Hampton. The prisoners were also\r\ncharged with having bailed up and robbed the mail near Campbelltown, on\r\nApril 10th. The proceedings were of the usual character. The prisoners\r\nwere convicted on both charges and were sentenced, Willis to ten years'\r\nand Booth and Hampton each to eight years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe April Sessions at Bathurst were unusually heavy. John Weekes was\r\nsentenced to death for the murder of Mr. Scheffts at Grenfell, and John\r\nConnors for attempted murder in another bushranging exploit. Besides\r\nthese, Patrick Foran and James Kelly were sent to gaol for ten years\r\nfor sticking up the Half-Way House on the Carcoar Road, and other\r\nacts of bushranging; James Kennedy, alias Southgate, to fifteen years\r\nfor sticking up John Edwards, William Woodley, and Henry Rodwell,\r\nat Murdering Swamp on January 1st--Kennedy also pleaded guilty to\r\nrobbing John Fawcett and John Eaton; Charles Rutherford, who had been\r\nengaged in several robberies in company with William Mackie, who, as\r\nalready related, had jumped out of the train while being conveyed to\r\nSydney, and was afterwards captured in the Northern district, was\r\nsentenced to seven years' penal servitude; Smith and Moran sentenced\r\nto seventeen years each, and Kerr to ten years. These, with some\r\nprisoners, sentenced for minor offences, were being conveyed to Sydney\r\nto gaol on April 25th, 1867. There were fifteen prisoners in all,\r\nguarded by eight troopers. Sergeant Casey, in charge, was seated on\r\nthe box seat of the Cobb's coach. The prisoners were inside chained\r\ntogether in two gangs of seven and eight respectively. Constables\r\nMadden and Kennedy were seated, unarmed, with the prisoners, while the\r\nother five troopers rode beside the coach fully armed. At Pulpit Hill\r\nthe prisoners, notwithstanding the heavy force opposed to them, made\r\na desperate attempt to escape, and in the melee Constable Holmes was\r\nkilled, while Rutherford and another prisoner got away in the bush.\r\nRutherford immediately returned to his old haunts and recommenced his\r\ndepredations. In December, 1867, he was captured by Sergeant Cleary,\r\nof Bourke, and was conveyed to the lock-up, but he again contrived to\r\nescape. In January, 1868, he stuck up the Boggy Creek and Galathera\r\nInns, and robbed numbers of people on the road. He then went to Mr.\r\nBeauvais' inn at Cannonbar and called on the landlord to bail up. Mr.\r\nBeauvais, however, had a pistol in the till and knew how to use it. On\r\npretence of taking out the money, to hand over as commanded, he got out\r\nhis revolver and shot the bushranger. He was awarded a silver medal by\r\nthe Government for this act.\r\n\r\nThe districts raided by Rutherford and Thunderbolt overlapped, so\r\nthat it is difficult to decide which of these two bushrangers were\r\nresponsible for many of the outrages. Ward, however, was not idle. In\r\ncompany with a boy named Mason, he stuck up and robbed the Northern,\r\nthe Walcha, and several other mails in the district. He was frequently\r\nchased by the police, but being a magnificent rider, with an intimate\r\nknowledge of every gully, ravine, or hill in the extensive district\r\nover which he ranged, he always contrived to escape. Sometimes he was\r\nvery hard pressed, as, for instance, when he was compelled to abandon\r\nTalleyrand, a racehorse for the recovery of which Mr. Wyndham had\r\noffered a reward of £100, in April, 1869. His companions were captured\r\none after the other. They were generally boys of from sixteen to\r\ntwenty, but Thunderbolt continued his career unchecked. No doubt he\r\nowed many of his hairbreadth escapes to the superiority of his horses.\r\nHe would travel two hundred miles to steal a noted racehorse. Thus he\r\nstole Mr. Samuel Clift's horse, John Brown, from Breeza. The horse had\r\nrun on the Maitland and Sydney courses.\r\n\r\nOne of the stories told about Ward was that he stuck up a German band\r\nat Goonoo Goonoo Gap, and made the Teutons play for him, besides\r\ngiving him their money. The Germans pleaded hard. They said they were\r\nonly poor men, and that their wives and children would suffer if they\r\nwere robbed. Thunderbolt told them that he must have money. He was\r\nwaiting for the principal winner at the Tamworth Races, he added, and\r\nhe promised that if he caught him he would return the Germans their\r\nmoney. He took down their names and addresses. Notwithstanding this\r\nthe Germans departed very sorrowful. They never expected to see their\r\nmoney again. Nevertheless, on their arrival at their home in Warwick,\r\nQueensland, they found a Post Office Order for £20 awaiting them. It\r\nwas surmised, therefore, that Thunderbolt had captured the winner.\r\n\r\nOn May 25, 1870, Ward met Mr. Blanche, innkeeper, near Uralla,\r\nreturning home with his wife from a drive, and called on him to bail\r\nup. Blanche laughed, but took no further notice of the order. Ward\r\nexclaimed, \"No humbugging. You wouldn't let me have a bottle of rum the\r\nother night, though I offered £5 for it.\" Blanche replied that he never\r\nserved any one after hours. He then took four shillings and sixpence\r\nfrom his pocket and said, \"This is all the money I've got. You can have\r\nthat.\" The robber said, \"The missus has more than that.\" \"No,\" cried\r\nMrs. Blanche, \"I've no money. We only came for a drive.\" Ward seemed to\r\nconsider for a moment, and then told Mr. Blanche to drive on. Several\r\nmen came up the by-road from Carlisle Gully, and Ward stopped and\r\nrobbed them. An old man named Williamson, and an Italian dealer named\r\nGiovanni Cappisote, were also stopped, but after handing over a gold\r\nwatch and chain, a small nugget of gold, and £3 13S. 6d. in money, the\r\ndealer was allowed to depart. The other men were taken to Blanche's\r\nInn, where Williamson was ordered to shout. He did so, and then Ward\r\nshouted. They danced, and sang, and enjoyed themselves. Becoming\r\nquieter, Ward asked Blanche whether he remembered a fight between a\r\nbushranger and the police at the Rocks, about three hundred yards away,\r\nseven years before. Blanche said he remembered it well. \"Well,\" cried\r\nWard, \"I'm the man; I was shot in the leg.\" Ward went on to relate more\r\nof his exploits, the narrative being interspersed with songs and dances.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Cappisote drove on to a selector's farm about a mile\r\nand a half along the road. Here he told Mrs. Dorrington what had\r\nhappened. He borrowed a saddle and bridle, took his horse from the\r\ncart, and rode to Uralla; making a wide détour round Blanche's house.\r\nHe told the police where the bushranger was, and Constables Mulhall\r\nand Walker armed and mounted at once. Mulhall had the faster horse and\r\nhe reached Blanche's first. As he rode up he saw Ward and a young man,\r\nboth mounted on gray horses, riding along the road. He followed them,\r\nand as he approached Ward turned round in his saddle and fired. Mulhall\r\nreturned the fire but his horse bolted. The trooper soon pulled him\r\nup. He wheeled and, seeing one of the men on the grays gallop away,\r\nfollowed shouting to Walker to \"look after the other fellow.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"other fellow\" was Thunderbolt, and he turned off the road and rode\r\ndown the steep hill towards the Rocky River, followed by Constable\r\nWalker. Both men fired a shot occasionally when an opportunity offered\r\nbut neither spoke. On reaching the bank of the river, Ward plunged\r\nin, intending to cross and escape up the opposite range, but Walker\r\nshot his horse. Ward fell into the river, which was shallow there, and\r\nhe rose immediately. Walker galloped along the bank past a deep hole\r\nand crossed. Then he returned to where Ward was standing in the water\r\nand called on him to surrender. \"Who the---- are you?\" enquired Ward\r\nroughly. \"Never mind who I am,\" replied Walker, \"put your hands up.\"\r\n\"Are you a trooper?\" asked Ward. \"Yes,\" replied Walker. \"Married?\"\r\ncontinued Ward. \"Yes,\" said Walker. \"Well, remember your family,\" said\r\nWard. \"Oh, that's all right,\" returned the trooper. \"Will you come\r\nout and surrender?\" \"No,\" cried Ward, \"I'll die first.\" \"Then it's\r\nyou and me for it,\" said Walker. The trooper urged his horse into the\r\nriver. The animal objected at first and then entered with a rush into\r\ndeep water. Walker raised his revolver above his head to keep it dry.\r\nWard fired several shots, none of which took effect. When the horse\r\nsteadied Walker fired again and Ward fell. He rose again immediately\r\nand tried to scramble up the bank. Walker struck him with the butt of\r\nhis revolver and the bushranger fell back into the deep hole and sank.\r\nThe trooper slipped from his horse, and reaching down grabbed Ward's\r\nshirt and pulled him up. He dragged the bushranger out of the hole,\r\nup the steep bank, and laid him out on the grass, believing him to be\r\ndead. Then he remounted and rode to Blanche's Hotel for assistance\r\nto bring the body in. Several of the men about there volunteered to\r\nhelp, but on their reaching the river they found that the bushranger\r\nhad disappeared. A search was made, but it was too dark to look for\r\ntracks. The next morning at daybreak the police and several civilians\r\nwent to the spot and found a trail of blood. They followed it, and\r\nfound Ward hidden under some bushes. He was placed in a cart and taken\r\nto Uralla, but he died before night. The young man chased by Constable\r\nMulhall said he had gone after Ward to try and get back a horse which\r\nthe bushranger had stolen from him, and as nothing detrimental to his\r\ncharacter was known he was discharged at the police court.\r\n\r\nConstable Walker was highly complimented for the pluck and\r\ndetermination he had shown in this desperate encounter with the noted\r\nbushranger in a deep water hole in a mountain stream with no one\r\nlooking on. Of the many brave actions recorded of the police this was\r\nperhaps the bravest and the most tragical. The constable was promoted\r\nand paid his well-earned reward.\r\n\r\nIn referring to this duel the _Melbourne Argus_ spoke of Ward as the\r\nlast of the \"professional bushrangers\" of New South Wales, and said:\r\n\"With a much more compact territory than New South Wales, and with a\r\npopulation which can entertain no ancestral or traditional sympathies\r\nwith burglars or highwaymen, we are nevertheless amenable to the same\r\nreproaches as those with which the neighbouring colony was assailed a\r\nfew years ago.\"\r\n\r\nI have already dealt with this mild pharisaical glorification of\r\nVictoria as compared with New South Wales, and have no intention of\r\nenlarging upon it here. I refer to it merely to remind the reader that\r\nbushrangers were at work elsewhere than in New South Wales at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n  Bushranging in the Wild Paroo; A Raid into South Australia; A Relic\r\n  of the Bushranging Era; Agitation for the Release of Gardiner;\r\n  Official Reports as to Twenty-four Bushrangers Still in Gaol; The\r\n  Cases of Gardiner and William Brookman; Gardiner and the Other\r\n  Bushrangers Released; Gardiner Leaves the Country.\r\n\r\n\r\nBushranging in New South Wales practically ceased with the death of\r\nFrederick Ward, alias Captain Thunderbolt. Previously to his tragical\r\ndeath in the New England River, the few stragglers from the big gangs\r\nhad been captured, and any new men who attempted to revive the \"reign\r\nof terror\" were speedily dealt with by the police. There were some few\r\nrobberies besides those already related which may be mentioned here.\r\nThey were distributed over a wide range of country, one party even\r\ncrossing the border into South Australia, where the bushranger had\r\nhitherto been known only by hearsay. But these later bushrangers did\r\nnot inspire the terror which those who had passed away had done. They\r\nwere very small fry as compared with Gardiner, Gilbert, Hall, Dunn,\r\nMorgan, Thunderbolt, and their companions. Three bushrangers stuck up\r\nMr. Wearne's station at Crookwell on January 6th, 1869, and stole £80\r\nworth of property. The Carcoar mail was bailed up on the mountains,\r\nnear the Bathurst Road, by two bushrangers, when £15 were taken from\r\nthe passengers and the bags were searched. A desperate attempt was made\r\nto stick up the Joint Stock Bank at Braidwood, but the robbers were\r\nbeaten off. The Southern mail was robbed on May 10th between Goulburn\r\nand Marulan. An attempt was made to stick up the Yass mail on the 24th.\r\nMr. Longfield, a passenger, was wounded, but the robber was forced to\r\nretire without having effected his purpose.\r\n\r\nIn December, a number of people were bailed up and robbed in the\r\nParoo and Warrego districts. The \"Wild Paroo\" had not been very long\r\nreclaimed from its original desert state, but this did not prevent an\r\nenterprising bushranger from finding his way there, though he did not\r\ncontinue his career for any very lengthened period. He stuck up Messrs.\r\nLyons & Martin's station, and made the men sit on the top rail of the\r\nstockyard fence while he rolled up a parcel of goods which he selected\r\nfrom the store. Messrs. Browne, Zouch, and Bradley drove up in a buggy\r\nwhile he was thus engaged, and were ordered to dismount and take their\r\nplaces on the fence with the station hands. The robber escorted them,\r\npistol in hand, from where the buggy stood to the stockyard. While\r\nwalking across this intervening space, the bushranger inadvertently, or\r\ncarelessly perhaps, stepped rather too near to Mr. Browne, who stood\r\nsix feet five inches in his socks, and was proportionately strong. With\r\na whoop Mr. Browne pounced on to him and held him as in a vice. This\r\nturned the tables completely. The men on the fence got off, and the\r\nbushranger was in his turn securely tied to the fence and kept there\r\nuntil the police could be brought from the nearest town, Bourke, about\r\na hundred and fifty miles away, to conduct him to prison. After this,\r\nbushranging does not appear to have been popular in this district.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th May, 1869, Mr. Henry Kidder Gillham, manager of the\r\nAustralian Joint Stock Bank at Braidwood, returned home at eight p.m.,\r\nand entered by the side gate, when a man sprang out from the shadow and\r\ncalled on him to stand. The bushranger presented a revolver, which Mr.\r\nGillham pushed aside, when another man struck him with a life preserver\r\nand knocked him down. Two shots were fired from revolvers. Michael\r\nCollins, a gardener living on the bank premises, was in the kitchen\r\nwhen the two bushrangers entered. One of them called out: \"Not a word,\r\nor it will be the worse for you.\" The tall man had a \"Northumberland\r\nvoice--that is, he could not pronounce the r.\" They tied Collins, and\r\nwent out of the kitchen. In the meantime the firing had been heard, and\r\nMr. Finnigan, a teacher, with Sergeant Duffy and Constable Luke Dacy,\r\nran to the bank. When they got there two men ran out of the garden, and\r\nafter a chase, during which several shots were fired, Joseph Horne was\r\ncaptured. He had no boots on. The other man, John Bollard, escaped at\r\nthe time, but was tracked and captured subsequently. The Chief Justice,\r\nSir Alfred Stephen, said that Horne had been sentenced to seven years'\r\nhard labour at Maitland. He was afterwards convicted in Melbourne and\r\nhad escaped from Pentridge stockade, having been shot in the shoulder.\r\nHorne said that punishment had made him what he was, and pleaded hard\r\nfor Bollard, who was young and had been enticed from the right path by\r\nhim. Horne was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment and Bollard to\r\nten years.\r\n\r\nJohn Baker and William Bertram divided their attentions between New\r\nSouth Wales and South Australia. In May, 1869, warrants were issued\r\nfor their arrest for horse stealing from the Mount Murchison station.\r\nThey took to the road and stuck up a number of people. In October they\r\nbailed up a hawker named Charles Young, who resisted and was shot\r\ndead. This occurred at the Barrier Ranges, not a great way from where\r\nthe Broken Hill silver-lead lode was afterwards discovered. Bertram\r\nwas followed and captured, and was subsequently tried, convicted,\r\nand hung at Bathurst. Baker escaped for the time and made his way to\r\nKoringa. Said the _South Australian Register_, \"He showed a remarkable\r\nwant of caution in returning to a district where he had passed his\r\nhobble-de-hoy years and was consequently well known.\" He had been\r\nemployed as a horse-breaker at the Cross Roads Grounds, Burra Burra,\r\nabout seven years previously and had afterwards worked for Messrs.\r\nMacdonald & Hockin, mail coach proprietors, on the Great Northern Road.\r\nOn his arrival at Koringa he went into a barber's shop and asked to\r\nhave his hair cut and dyed. The hairdresser refused to dye it. Baker\r\nswore at him, but could not change his determination. The bushranger\r\nalso grumbled at the time spent in cutting his hair, and continually\r\nurged the barber to \"hurry up.\" When the job was completed Baker walked\r\nto Redruth, and sat down in the main street opposite the Court House,\r\nwhere the police sessions were being held at the time. There were a\r\nnumber of people about, but Baker sat and cut his tobacco with all\r\nthe nonchalance of innocence. He filled and lighted his pipe, and was\r\nsmoking comfortably, when Corporal Smith and Constable Walker came up\r\nand said \"You're our prisoner.\" \"What for?\" asked Baker. \"Bushranging,\"\r\nwas the short reply. Baker sprang up from his seat, and raced away at\r\na great rate along the road. He was speedily followed by the police\r\non horseback and brought back. He struggled furiously, slipping his\r\nhands from the handcuffs with the greatest ease. The police, however,\r\ncarried him into the lock-up, and put him into a cell. When questioned,\r\nhe said he had brought a mob of horses down country for sale, and\r\ncarried a revolver for his own protection. In the same cell was a man\r\nnamed Dobson arrested for horse stealing, who had been quiet until\r\nBaker came. But the door was barely closed and locked when the gaoler\r\nheard a suspicious noise in the cell. On opening the door he found\r\nthat Baker and Dobson were trying to make a hole in the roof with a\r\nheavy board seat which they had wrenched from its mortice, and were now\r\nusing as a battering-ram. Baker was placed in another cell and ironed.\r\nHe was a small wiry man, very active, and a daring rider. In company\r\nwith Bertram he had stuck up the Mount Murchison station; stuck up Mr.\r\nCobham's station two hundred miles from Wilcannia, and taken money, a\r\nrevolver, and several horses; stolen the horse he was riding from Mr.\r\nO'Leary, of Poolamacca; robbed and murdered a hawker at the Barrier\r\nranges, and stuck up and robbed a number of people on the roads about\r\nTiers, Gummeracha, and other places near the Murray River, on both\r\nsides of the New South Wales-South Australian border. When Bertram was\r\ncaptured, Baker endeavoured to induce a young man whom he met to join\r\nhim, telling him that they could easily raise £200 to £300, but the\r\nyoung fellow replied that he \"didn't want to be hung yet.\" Baker was\r\nextradited to New South Wales, and was tried and hung at Bathurst early\r\nin 1871.\r\n\r\nOn May 20th, 1870, _The Queanbeyan Age_ reported the finding of a\r\nmail bag near the Big Hill. The bag was still locked and the seal\r\nintact, but the bottom had been ripped open. It had evidently, from its\r\nappearance, been lying in the bush for a long time, probably several\r\nyears. It was referred to as \"a relic of the bygone bushranging era in\r\nthe district.\"\r\n\r\nThe Muswellbrook and Cassilis coach was stuck up at Wappinguey, on\r\nNovember 1st, 1870, by two armed men. When ordered to bail up, E.\r\nCummins, the driver, enquired \"What for?\" \"You'll soon see. Drive into\r\nthat bit of scrub,\" was the reply. Cummins did as he was ordered, and\r\nwhen the coach was out of sight of the road he was made to get down and\r\nhold his horses while the robbers went through the letter bags. When\r\nthey had finished, they told him to gather up the letters and go.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd, Mr. Bellamy was lying under his cart asleep, about three\r\nmiles from Forbes, on the Currajong Road, when he was awakened by\r\nsome one calling \"Come out o' that.\" He asked what was the matter,\r\nand was told to come out unless he wanted his \"brains blown out.\" He\r\ncrawled from under the tarpaulin which covered his cart, and handed\r\nthe bushrangers three £1 notes. \"Where's the rest? We know what you\r\ngot for your load at Forbes,\" said one of the bushrangers. \"I paid it\r\naway to a man I owed it to,\" replied Bellamy. \"That won't do. You never\r\nstopped anywhere; we were watching you. Where is it?\" As Bellamy still\r\npersisted in saying that he had paid away the money, he was compelled\r\nto stand with his face to the wheel and was tied there. A handkerchief\r\nwas also tied round his head, with the knot thrust into his mouth, as\r\na gag. They shook out Bellamy's blankets, searched the feed-bag of his\r\nhorses, and hunted everywhere, until at length they discovered thirteen\r\n£1 notes tucked under the tilt of the cart. Having secured their booty\r\nthey cautioned Bellamy not to move for an hour under pain of being\r\nshot, and went away. Two of them jumped over the track in what was\r\ncalled the road, to avoid leaving footmarks in the dust, but the third\r\nappeared to be stiff and walked across into the bush. After they had\r\nbeen out of sight for a time, Bellamy began to struggle. He capsized\r\nthe spring cart before he succeeded in breaking the rope, but as soon\r\nas he got loose he walked back to Forbes and informed the police of\r\nthe robbery. The robbers were followed and found in a public-house\r\ndrinking, a day or two after the robbery.\r\n\r\nOne day, about this time, a man walked into the branch bank at\r\nCassilis, pointed a pistol at the head of the cashier, and ordered him\r\nto \"bail up, or I'll blow your brains out.\" \"Will you, by G--?\" cried\r\nthe cashier, as he placed his hands on the counter and vaulted over.\r\nThe would-be robber was so startled by this unexpected action on the\r\npart of the cashier that he dropped his weapon and ran. The cashier\r\nimmediately gave chase along Main Street, and soon captured and brought\r\nback the pseudo bushranger. The news spread rapidly, and in a few\r\nminutes the whole population of the little township was in the Main\r\nStreet. It was soon learned that the only policeman stationed in the\r\ntown had gone to Mudgee \"on a case,\" the would-be robber was therefore\r\ntreated to a good cuffing and some threats, and turned adrift. The\r\nrevolver was found to be old, rusty, and useless, but for some time it\r\nhung in the bank chamber as a caution to bushrangers. It may be there\r\nyet for all I know. This attempted bank robbery appears to have been\r\nconducive to thirst, as the bars of the two \"hotels\" were crowded for\r\nthe rest of the day by a laughing and jeering mob of citizens.\r\n\r\nThis little comedy furnishes a very appropriate finish to the story\r\nof the many tragedies which were enacted during this the most serious\r\noutbreak of bushranging which has occurred in New South Wales. During\r\nthe following two or three years the people were gradually becoming\r\nconvinced that the crime of bushranging had been thoroughly stamped\r\nout, and a sort of reaction set in. Letters appeared in the newspapers,\r\nin which the writers urged that some clemency might safely be shown to\r\nsome of the young men who were still in gaol. In spite of the brutal\r\nindifference which many of the bushrangers had shown for human life, it\r\nwas almost impossible to help admiring the reckless courage exhibited\r\nby them. One thought was frequently expressed in various ways. It was\r\nthat these bushrangers would have made magnificent soldiers if they had\r\nbeen properly trained and made amenable to discipline. There was in\r\nfact a disposition to regard them much as the philosopher regards dirt,\r\nas \"matter in the wrong place.\" Although no record of the movement\r\ncan be found in the newspapers and other publications of the period,\r\nthere can be no doubt that the growth of the spirit of humanitarianism,\r\nnow so prominent a characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon in all parts of\r\nthe world, had an immense influence. The convict system, which was\r\nregarded as the basis of bushranging, had long since passed away.\r\nThe convicts themselves had almost died out, and had ceased to be a\r\nprominent class in the community. Here and there one of the old fellows\r\nlingered and told stories of the barbarous times which had once existed\r\nin the colonies. But they were generally incapacitated by age from\r\ndoing much harm. There had been a time when horror and detestation of\r\nthe convicts was very general, but even these feelings had gone now,\r\nand there was a prevalent opinion that the convicts had been made\r\nworse by the brutal discipline to which they had been subjected. The\r\nvery papers which were most strenuous in their exhortations to the\r\nGovernment of the day to stamp out bushranging at any cost, and which\r\nurged the police and all orderly citizens to slay and kill any person\r\nwho interfered with the mails or who molested travellers on the high\r\nroads, now admitted that the bushrangers had been harshly dealt with.\r\nThose who had been convicted of murder, or of attempts to murder, had\r\nbeen hung or shot, while the lesser criminals had been sentenced to\r\npenal servitude for life or for very long periods. The juries all over\r\nthe country had shown no leanings towards mercy or clemency, and the\r\njudges had treated the bushrangers with great severity. The people\r\ngenerally, it was asserted, had given ample proof that they would not\r\ntolerate a reign of terror such as the bushrangers had striven so hard\r\nto establish, and if there should ever be another outbreak, which was\r\nnot considered probable, it would be crushed out long before it could\r\npossibly assume such vast proportions as it had gained during the past\r\nera. If there were evil-disposed persons in the colony they would be\r\naware that public opinion was opposed to them and would hesitate before\r\nthey decided to adopt bushranging as a profession. It is worthy of note\r\nthat although the brutalities exercised under the old convict system\r\nwere said to have tended towards the demoralisation of the community,\r\nand were largely responsible for the prevalence of bushranging and\r\nother crimes, the practice of flogging for serious offences is still\r\nthe law in many of the colonies. The general public, however, is seldom\r\nlogical, and therefore even the Australians still strive to abolish\r\nbrutal crimes by punishments no less brutal, although the history of\r\nthe colonies affords such ample evidence of the futility of these\r\nmeans. But the spirit of mercy was abroad. Public meetings were held in\r\nall centres of population, petitions were sent to the Governor and the\r\nLegislature, and the Press was full of letters praying that mercy might\r\nbe shown to the evil-doers. The prisoner most frequently mentioned\r\nwas Frank Gardiner. It is true that he had organised the first gang,\r\nand had given a vent to the evil passions of a class. But for him\r\nthis terrible bushranging era might never have been inaugurated. But\r\nhe had never committed murder, and had retired from the country and\r\nendeavoured to lead a lawful life after only a few months on the\r\nroad. It had been said that he was engaged in sly grog selling, even\r\nwhen he was ostensibly keeping a store on the road to the diggings\r\nin Queensland, but if so it was for the Queensland authorities, not\r\nthose of New South Wales, to punish him for this offence against the\r\nlicensing laws. The Queensland authorities had, however, never made\r\nany charge against him, and the report might not be true. At length\r\nthe Chief Justice (the late Sir Alfred Stephen) wrote to the Sydney\r\nnewspapers. His letter appeared on June 23rd, 1874. Sir Alfred said\r\nthat the end and aim of all punishment are, first, the preventing of\r\nindividuals, and secondly, the deterring of other individuals, from\r\nthe committing of similar crimes.... Sentences aggregating thirty-two\r\nyears had been passed in a time of great excitement, and the punishment\r\nseemed to have been measured more in view of the crimes he was supposed\r\nto have committed than with reference solely to those which were proved\r\nagainst him.... He could not say whether the reported reformation\r\nwas sincere, but he thought that the prisoner had been sufficiently\r\npunished and, therefore, recommended a conditional pardon.\r\n\r\nEmanating from such a source, this opinion carried great weight, and\r\nalmost coincident with its publication, the Governor, Sir Hercules\r\nRobinson, afterwards Lord Rosmead, laid before the Executive Council\r\nsix petitions signed by a number of well known and responsible persons\r\nin various parts of the colony praying for the release of the convict\r\nGardiner. He said it was true that no hope of an absolute remission\r\nof his sentence had ever been held out to him, but in the Governor's\r\nminute of December 5th, 1872, it had been implied that if the prisoner\r\ncontinued to conduct himself well he might hope for remission at the\r\nend of ten years.\r\n\r\nOfficial returns were laid on the table showing the number of prisoners\r\nstill in penal servitude for highway robbery. The prisoner whose case\r\nattracted most attention next to Gardiner was William Brookman. His\r\nparents were said to be respectable. He was only seventeen years of age\r\nwhen he was charged on January 16th, 1868, with wounding with intent\r\nto murder. He was convicted and sentenced to death, but his sentence\r\nwas commuted to fifteen years' penal servitude. It was said to have\r\nbeen his first and only attempt at highway robbery, and he had never\r\npreviously been arrested or charged with any offence against the law.\r\nAt the time of this enquiry he had served six and a-half years of his\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nThe other bushrangers in gaol were:--Samuel Clarke, sentenced April\r\n18th, 1866. Served five years, one month. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nDaniel Shea, sentenced November 6th, 1865. Served eight years, six\r\nmonths. Previously sentenced for two years for horse stealing.\r\n\r\nWilliam Willis, alias Dunkley, sentenced May 16th, 1866. Served eight\r\nyears. Three previous convictions for horse stealing, of nine months,\r\neighteen months, and six months respectively.\r\n\r\nAlexander Fordyce, sentenced February 23rd, 1863. Served eleven years,\r\nnine months. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nJohn Payne, sentenced January 14th, 1868. Served six years, six months.\r\nNo previous conviction.\r\n\r\nJames Jones, sentenced March 31st, 1864. Served ten years, one month.\r\nNo previous conviction.\r\n\r\nRobert Cotterall, alias Blue Cap, sentenced April 29th, 1868. Served\r\nsix years, one month. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nJames Boyd, alias McGrath, sentenced February 24th, 1864. Served nine\r\nyears, three months. Previously sent to gaol for five years for horse\r\nstealing.\r\n\r\nThomas Cunningham, alias Smith, sentenced April 9th, 1867. Served seven\r\nyears, one month. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nCharles Hugh Gough, alias Wyndham, alias Bennett, sentenced April 9th,\r\n1867, served seven years, one month. Previously sentenced to three\r\nyears for assault with intent to rob.\r\n\r\nThomas Dargue, sentenced March 28th, 1867. Served seven years, two\r\nmonths. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nHenry Dargue, sentenced March 28th, 1867. Served seven years, two\r\nmonths. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nJohn Kelly, sentenced March 11th, 1867. Served seven years, two months.\r\nPreviously sentenced to two years for embezzlement.\r\n\r\nEdward Kelly, sentenced January 14th, 1867. Served six years, seven\r\nmonths. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nJames Smith, sentenced April 15th, 1866. Served seven years, one month.\r\nPreviously sentenced to three years for horse stealing.\r\n\r\nJohn Foran, sentenced October 18th, 1867. Served six years, seven\r\nmonths. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nJohn Williams, sentenced to death January 14th, 1868. Sentence commuted\r\nto fifteen years' penal servitude. Served six years, four months. No\r\nprevious conviction.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Simmons, sentenced April 6th, 1868. Served six years, one\r\nmonth. Previously sentenced to ten years on two charges of larceny.\r\n\r\nWilliam Taverner, sentenced April 5th, 1867. Served five years, one\r\nmonth. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nDaniel Taylor, sentenced October 24th, 1865. Served eight years, one\r\nmonth. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nJohn Bow, sentenced February 26th, 1863. Sentence death, commuted to\r\nimprisonment for life. Served eleven years, six months. No previous\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nJohn Bollard, sentenced October 19th, 1869. Served four years, seven\r\nmonths. No previous conviction.\r\n\r\nAll these prisoners were very young men, little more than boys,\r\nwhen they were convicted; and, of the twenty-three, sixteen had\r\nhad no charges brought against them previously to their arrest for\r\nhighway robbery. The four others who had been previously convicted of\r\nhorse-stealing were cattle duffers and horse planters, which had been,\r\na few years before, scarcely considered to be crimes by the residents\r\nof the districts in which these young men were born; although the law,\r\nwhen it came to be enforced in these districts, called these acts\r\ncriminal. It was said that if Gardiner was to be released these young\r\nmen, who had been led away principally by his example, should also have\r\ntheir sentences remitted.\r\n\r\nThe reports with such comments as had been made on them by the\r\nExecutive Council were placed before the Legislative Assembly, and on\r\nJuly 3rd a debate began relative to the cases of Gardiner and Brookman,\r\nit being understood that the decision in the case of Brookman should\r\napply to the other twenty-two named in the reports. On a division being\r\ntaken the vote stood twenty-six for and twenty-six against a remission\r\nof the sentences. The Speaker gave his casting vote with the ayes, and\r\nit was consequently resolved that the two prisoners should be released\r\non July 8th, 1874.\r\n\r\nThe Governor extended the prerogative of mercy to the others named\r\nabove, and they were all released at the same time. In the case of\r\nGardiner the pardon was coupled with the condition that he should leave\r\nthe colony forthwith, consequently a short time after his release he\r\nsailed to California, and was reported to have died there about nine\r\nyears later. Mrs. Brown, his paramour, had died in New Zealand during\r\nhis incarceration.\r\n\r\nThe release of the bushrangers was not carried without opposition,\r\nhowever. A monster meeting of diggers was held at Grenfell to protest\r\nagainst any mercy being shown them. Large meetings were held elsewhere,\r\nand it was said that remitting the sentences of the bushrangers\r\nwas tantamount to encouraging other evil-disposed persons to rebel\r\nagainst the laws. The speakers deplored the action of the Governor,\r\nthe Executive, and the Legislature, and prophesied a new outbreak of\r\nlawlessness. But the spirit of the opposition was less active than that\r\nof the persons in favour of mercy, while the majority of the population\r\nwere more or less indifferent. And so ended the great outbreak of\r\nbushranging in New South Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n  Bushranging in Victoria; Robert Bourke; Harry Power: He Escapes from\r\n  Pentridge Gaol and Sticks Up the Mail; An Amateur Bushranger; The\r\n  Police Hunt Power Down and Capture him Asleep; A Peacock as \"Watch\r\n  Dog\"; The Power Procession at Beechworth; The Trial of Power; His\r\n  Sentence; Engaged to Lecture on Board the _Success_; His Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile New South Wales was the chief centre of bushranging during this\r\nepoch, the neighbouring colonies were not entirely free from the\r\ndisease. In those cases in which the epidemic flowed, as it were,\r\nover the borders of the mother colony--as when Morgan, Thunderbolt,\r\nand Bertram crossed into Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia\r\nrespectively--the inroads have been dealt with in connection with\r\nthe careers of these particular bushrangers in order not to break\r\nthe continuity of their stories. Having described the rise and fall\r\nof bushranging in the older colony, it is now necessary to return to\r\nVictoria and continue the narrative there. Bushranging in this colony\r\nduring this epoch was rather a survival from the past than a new\r\ndevelopment, and, with one notable exception, the police dealt promptly\r\nwith the lawbreakers. The exception will be noticed in due course.\r\n\r\nOn September 5th, 1862, Mr. Ryan, the landlord of the Travellers' Rest\r\nHotel at Yalla-y-poora, was at breakfast with his family and a visitor\r\nnamed Reid, when two armed men entered the room. One stood at the door,\r\nwhile the other, pistol in hand, stepped forward and cried \"Bail up.\"\r\nThey tied Messrs. Ryan and Reid, and took ten shillings from the till\r\nand ten one pound notes from under the mattress of the bed, where it\r\nhad been hidden. They did not search the women, but they broke some of\r\nthe furniture in the bedroom while hunting for the money. One of the\r\nrobbers pulled the boots off Mr. Reid's feet and put them on his own,\r\nleaving a very much worn and damaged pair in their place. They also\r\ntook Reid's horse, saddle, and bridle from the stable. Mr. Reid told\r\nthem that he was only a poor man, and that the loss of his horse would\r\nruin him. The robber replied, \"Well, he ain't the sort we want. I'll\r\nleave him for you at Macpherson's as soon as I get a better one.\" When\r\nthey had left Mrs. Ryan untied her husband and their guest, and Ryan\r\nmounted his horse and rode to Ararat to give information to the police.\r\nConstables Lawler and Griffen followed the bushrangers, and tracked\r\nthem to a hut near Mount Sturgeon, in the Grampian Ranges. The police\r\nexpected a fight, but they rushed the hut and captured the robbers\r\nwithout a shot being fired, although one of them named Regent had a\r\nloaded revolver in his hand. They were taken to the gaol at Ararat, and\r\nwere convicted and sentenced in due course.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1864, a sensation was caused in the Kilmore district by a\r\nreport which gained currency, that Gardiner and his gang had stuck\r\nup a number of people near Yea. A party of volunteers was speedily\r\norganised to assist the police in hunting down the bushrangers. The\r\npursuers were divided into small parties, and on the evening of the\r\n20th one of these, composed of Mr. Grant and Constable Buck, came upon\r\nthree suspicious-looking characters camped on Pack Bullock Flat with\r\na mob of horses. Constable Buck asked where they were going, when one\r\nreplied \"To Melbourne,\" and another \"To the Jordan.\" Buck called on\r\nthem to surrender, when one man sprang forward and clutched him by the\r\nthroat. Another rushed at Grant, who was unarmed. Grant turned and ran\r\nto where they had left their horses, calling on Buck to come away, and\r\nBuck broke loose and joined him. Buck however lost his revolver in the\r\nstruggle. They rode away to find help, and returned with Mr. Grant's\r\nbrother, George Grant, and Mr. Walker. Grant shot one bushranger dead.\r\nWalker stunned a second with a blow on the head with the butt of his\r\ngun, while Buck captured the third after a smart run. The captured men\r\nwere convicted of robbery by violence, and it was said that the horses\r\nthey had with them had been stolen from various stations.\r\n\r\nRobert Bourke was employed as cook at Mr. Broughton's, Humewood\r\nStation, on the Murrumbidgee River, New South Wales, and appears to\r\nhave been suddenly affected with the bushranging mania. He ferried\r\nhimself across the river, and with the assistance of a young lad named\r\nQuinn stuck up and robbed several people in the neighbourhood. He was\r\nsaid to \"know every bulga from Barren Jack to Manaro,\" but did not stop\r\nlong in that district, perhaps because it had already been \"worked\r\nout\" by the Brothers Clarke and other bushrangers. In September, 1868,\r\nhe crossed the Murray River, and stuck up and robbed travellers on\r\nthe road near Wodonga and Wangaratta, gradually working southwards.\r\nOn October 4th he appeared at Mr. Hurst's station, Diamond Creek,\r\nabout fifteen miles from Melbourne, where a daring attempt was made\r\nto capture him. The story is that Bourke called at William Horner's\r\non the 2nd, and asked for a bed. He was told that there was none to\r\nspare, when he drew a revolver and cried \"Bail up.\" Horner slammed\r\nthe door in his face. Bourke fired, and the bullet passed through the\r\ndoor panel, but did no great injury. He tried to push the door open,\r\nbut, failing in this, he began to \"parley.\" He said he was hungry,\r\nand would go away quietly if he was given something to eat. Horner\r\nthen opened the door and gave him a pannikin of tea and some bread\r\nand cold meat. He sat down on a log and made a good meal. When he had\r\nfinished he asked for some \"tucker for the road\" and a horse, saddle,\r\nand bridle. Horner said that the horses were all down the paddock, and\r\nhe did not intend to run them in until next morning, but he could have\r\nsome \"tucker.\" He then gave him a large piece of bread and some meat.\r\nThey talked together very amicably. Bourke said, \"I'm a bushranger\r\nfrom New South Wales, and I've come here to see if your police are as\r\nclever as you blow about them. They'll never take me alive.\" He went\r\naway, and, it is supposed, slept in the bush. On the morning of the\r\n4th he went to Hurst's place and asked for some breakfast. Thinking he\r\nwas an ordinary tramp, Miss Hurst gave him some bread and meat in the\r\nkitchen, but, as he sat at table, she noticed that he carried pistols\r\nin his belt. She went into another room and informed her brother Henry,\r\nwho loaded a double-barrelled gun to be ready for any emergency. He\r\nwalked into the kitchen, carrying the gun behind him, to have a look at\r\ntheir suspicious guest, and asked him where he came from and where he\r\nwas going? \"From Cape Schank to Kilmore,\" was the reply. \"Then you're\r\nnot travelling in the right direction,\" remarked young Hurst. Bourke\r\njumped up from the table, as if in a passion, and cried \"Do you doubt\r\nmy word? Do you want to insult me?\" He drew his revolver and Hurst\r\nbrought his gun round and fired. He missed, and Bourke immediately shot\r\nhim in the chest. Although he was severely wounded young Hurst rushed\r\nforward and grappled with the bushranger, while Mr. Abbott and two or\r\nthree other men ran in to ascertain what the shooting was about. They\r\nsecured the bushranger and carried young Hurst to bed, but, although\r\nevery attention was paid to him, he died in a few hours. Bourke was\r\nidentified by the police as a man who had been sentenced to three\r\nyears' imprisonment for horse-stealing at Ararat. When he had served\r\nhis term he was of course discharged and, as was surmised, went to\r\nNew South Wales and obtained work on a station. He lived quietly for\r\nabout eighteen months, when he started bushranging as related. He was\r\ntwenty-five years of age at the date of his conviction for the murder\r\nof Henry Hurst.\r\n\r\nThe central figure in Victoria of this era was undoubtedly Harry Power.\r\nThis notorious bushranger arrived in Victoria from Ireland shortly\r\nbefore the proclamation of the discovery of gold at Ballarat, and\r\nwent to the diggings. In March, 1855, he was seen near Daisy Hill, in\r\nthe Maryborough district, riding a valuable horse, the description\r\nof which tallied with that of a horse which had been stolen and for\r\nwhich the police were seeking. He was stopped and challenged to show\r\nhis receipt for the horse. Instead of producing it or saying where it\r\nwas deposited, Power disputed the right of the police to stop him on\r\nthe highway and drew a revolver. The police, very naturally perhaps,\r\ntook this as a tacit admission that he could not show any right to the\r\nhorse, and sought to apprehend him. Several shots were fired and at\r\nlast one of the troopers fell wounded. Power put spurs to his horse and\r\ngalloped away. A warrant was immediately issued for his arrest and he\r\nwas followed and captured. He was convicted of \"wounding with intent\r\nto do grievous bodily harm,\" and was sentenced to fourteen years'\r\npenal servitude. A short time before the expiration of his term he was\r\nemployed in drawing refuse from the Pentridge Gaol to the rubbish heap\r\nin a go-cart. A number of other prisoners were similarly employed.\r\nWhile the cart he was helping to draw was being tipped Power contrived\r\nto secrete himself under a corner of the heap. He was not missed until\r\nevening, when the prisoners employed at this work were mustered. The\r\nprisoners at work with him must of course have been aware of his\r\nevasion, but professed ignorance in accordance with convict etiquette.\r\nA search was made and his hiding place was discovered, but Power was\r\ngone. He stole some clothes from a farm not far from Pentridge, and\r\nthe blade of an old pair of sheep shears to defend himself with, as\r\nhe declared that he would not be captured alive. Shortly after his\r\nescape, on May 7th, 1869, he stuck up the mail coach near Porepunkah\r\nand continued to rob in the Ovens and Beechworth districts for several\r\nmonths, when he made a raid into New South Wales, going as far as\r\nAdelong. He returned about the end of September to his old district and\r\nstayed there for the remainder of his career.\r\n\r\nCommenting on his actions, the _Ovens and Murray Advertiser_\r\nsaid--\"Possessed of a thorough knowledge of the country, this scoundrel\r\nhas made periodical descents to the settled districts, and afterwards,\r\nlike a hunted dog, betaken himself to the ranges. _From a certain\r\nportion of the population he--or whoever else has been masquerading\r\nin his name--has received succour and information, while the police\r\nhave been misled and deceived._\" The article from which this extract\r\nwas made was copied and italicised in the _Melbourne Argus_, and\r\nmade the subject of a leading article, in which it was contended\r\nthat if bushranging was to be stamped out the sympathisers and \"bush\r\ntelegraphs\" must be restrained from aiding the bushranger with food and\r\ninformation. The Government was urged to pass a special Act to enable\r\nthe police to contend with the difficulty. It was said on the other\r\nhand that the Outlawry Act, if strictly applied, would meet the case.\r\n\r\nWilliam Moore, of Buffalo, was returning from a trip to Eldorado,\r\nwhere he had sold his load of farm produce, when a young man rode up\r\nand asked him \"Where have you been?\" \"What's that to you?\" returned\r\nMoore. The young fellow said \"I only asked a civil question.\" \"Well,\"\r\nsaid Moore, \"I've been to Eldorado, and I'm going home. Will that\r\nsatisfy you?\" The young man nodded, and cantered on. As he passed,\r\nMoore noticed that he had pistols in his belt, and hastily took a roll\r\nof notes, worth £35, from his pocket, and thrust it into an empty\r\nflour sack in the dray. The young man only rode forward about fifty\r\nyards, and then wheeled round, revolver in hand, and cried \"Bail up.\"\r\nMoore stopped, and willingly turned out his pockets, displaying a\r\nhalf-crown, which he handed to the robber, who rode away. In reporting\r\nthis robbery Mr. Moore said that he believed that this was the young\r\nman's first attempt at highway robbery, as he trembled violently and\r\nseemed glad when it was over. The _Ovens and Murray Advertiser_ of May\r\n7, 1870, in commenting on this case, said: \"It shows the necessity of\r\nmore determined efforts to capture Harry Power, who has for more than\r\na year robbed rich and poor alike in this neighbourhood, and it is the\r\nimmunity which he has for so long enjoyed that encourages young lads to\r\nimitate him.\"\r\n\r\nShortly before, in April, Patrick Stanton, otherwise known as Jack\r\nMuck, was captured after a smart run. He was convicted of having stuck\r\nup and robbed a coloured man, a well-known splitter and timber cutter,\r\non the Black Dog Creek. The splitter had been to town to be paid for a\r\nnumber of posts and rails, and was returning home along the Rutherglen\r\nRoad when he was bailed up.\r\n\r\nThe Kilmore _Free Press_ reported that Power had been seen in Mr.\r\nDunlop's paddock at Mount William. He was firing at a mark on a tree.\r\nNo one interfered with him.\r\n\r\nOn May 2nd, Edward Kelly was arrested at Greta and was charged with\r\nhaving assisted Power in some of his robberies. He was not identified\r\nby the witnesses, and was therefore discharged.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th Superintendents Nicholson and Hare, Sergeant Montford, and\r\nBlack-tracker Donald left Wangaratta and made a journey into the ranges\r\nnear the head of the King River. It was believed that they had received\r\nspecial information from a friend of the bushranger. At the head of the\r\nglen, near where Power's camp was, a family named Quinn resided, and it\r\nwas said that Power would never be caught while they were there. The\r\nQuinns owned several dogs and a peacock, which it was believed would\r\nnever allow any person to pass up the ravine without giving notice. The\r\npeacock was reported to be the \"best watch dog of the lot.\" His screams\r\ncould be heard far away whenever a stranger approached the hut, and\r\nhe generally gave the first signal, and thus roused the dogs. On this\r\noccasion, however, the police passed without either the peacock or the\r\ndogs giving a sign. They came to a hollow tree with holes in the stem.\r\nThis tree had been mentioned as \"Power's look-out,\" and it was reported\r\nthat he frequently went into it to survey the country round, through\r\nthe holes, without exposing himself. There was plenty of room inside\r\nfor more than one man, and the natural holes formed by the decay of the\r\ntree had been added to by augur holes bored at a convenient height for\r\nspying through. They examined it, but it was empty. All round was a\r\ndense growth of cherry and wattle scrub, which they cautiously pushed\r\ntheir way through, and peeped into a small clearing. A gunyah of bark\r\nstood in the middle of this space, and before it was a fire burning.\r\nCreeping cautiously up, the police saw a man's leg sticking out from\r\nunder the gunyah. One of them seized it, and drew the man out on his\r\nback. It was Harry Power. He had been lying asleep under the impression\r\nthat he was perfectly safe. He gave a loud howl on being thus rudely\r\nawakened, and then asked, \"Who are you?\" \"The police,\" was the reply.\r\n\"No fear,\" said Power; \"you couldn't have got past Quinn's; the dogs\r\nand the peacock would not have let you.\" \"We did,\" replied Inspector\r\nNicholson; \"the dogs and the peacock never saw us, but there were\r\nseveral men there and Quinn himself--they saw us.\" \"You've given us a\r\ngreat deal of trouble, Power,\" said Inspector Hare, \"but we've got you\r\nat last.\" \"I'm very sorry I didn't hear you,\" remarked Power; \"I'd\r\nhave dropped some of you if I had.\"\r\n\r\nIn the gunyah were a Government revolver, stolen from the police,\r\nloaded and capped; a double-barrelled gun, hanging from the ridge\r\npole, loaded ready for use; and a loaded pistol lying close beside the\r\nsleeping bushranger. There were also a box of slugs, a powder flask,\r\ntwo boxes of caps not quite full, a carpet-bag full of clothes, and\r\na saddle and bridle. The bed was a very comfortable one, with a good\r\nsupply of blankets.\r\n\r\nThe police informed Power that they had been out in the ranges for more\r\nthan a week and were starving. They had not had a mouthful of food for\r\nmore than twenty-four hours, and were anxious to get back to town.\r\n\"There's plenty of tucker here,\" said Power. \"Where?\" asked the police.\r\n\"In that tree,\" replied Power. They went to the tree and saw a bag hung\r\nup among the branches, as is common in the bush. In this \"bush safe\"\r\nthey found part of a large home-baked loaf, some potatoes, tea and\r\nsugar, and a piece of fresh beef. \"Golly, what a---- feed we'll have,\"\r\ncried Donald, the black, when he saw the food. The police cut the beef\r\ninto steaks and fried them and had a good meal. In their search they\r\nfound £15 4S. 6d. in bank notes and money.\r\n\r\nThey mounted Power on the horse ridden by the black tracker, while\r\nDonald mounted behind Sergeant Montford, and left the camp. They\r\nreached Wangaratta at seven p.m. on Sunday, June 5th, 1870, eleven days\r\nafter the death of Captain Thunderbolt in New South Wales. The news of\r\nthe capture had already been noised abroad in the district, and numbers\r\nof people, who were out for their Sunday evening ramble, crowded the\r\nstreets of Wangaratta to see the noted bushranger. Power waved his\r\nhand in response to their cheers, and cried \"They've caught poor Harry\r\nPower, but they caught him asleep.\"\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 7th, Power was removed to Beechworth gaol, and a\r\nnumber of men and women in carriages, buggies, spring carts, and other\r\nvehicles, or on horseback, went along the road to meet him and escort\r\nhim into the town. The procession as it passed over Newtown Bridge\r\nwas quite an imposing one, and there were collected the majority of\r\nthe residents who had neither horse nor vehicle. Power was sitting in\r\na police cart, and bowing right and left to the crowd as if he had\r\nbeen some high potentate. He wished the people \"Good morning,\" and\r\ncontinually repeated his formula about having been captured asleep.\r\nOn his arrival at the gaol he greeted Mr. Stewart as an old friend,\r\nand hoped they would never fall out. He made a short speech, in which\r\nhe publicly thanked the police for the kind and considerate manner in\r\nwhich he had been treated since his arrest.\r\n\r\nThe _Ovens Spectator_ at this time said: \"Henry Power, alias Johnson,\r\nis a hale, hearty-looking man, although past the meridian of life, with\r\ngrisly hair and beard, and certainly not of such an appearance as one\r\nwould expect a bushranger to have.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 2nd Henry Power was tried on four charges of highway\r\nrobbery. On May 7th, 1869, he bailed up Arthur Woodside, a squatter at\r\nHappy Valley, as he was riding towards Bright. The robber took a horse,\r\nsaddle, bridle, and spurs, giving in exchange a knocked-up horse, a\r\nbroken saddle, a bridle tied up with string, and one rusty spur. While\r\nMr. Woodside was giving his evidence Power exclaimed, \"Speak up, young\r\nman. You spoke different to that when I met you on the road.\" The mail\r\ncoach from Beechworth was bailed up at the same time. Power asked the\r\ndriver, Edward Coady, to throw out the gold. Coady replied, \"There is\r\nnone.\" \"I was told there was,\" exclaimed Power. \"Any parcels?\" Coady\r\nthrew down two, which Power opened. There was only one passenger, a\r\nChinaman, and Power asked him for the key of his carpet bag. At first\r\nthe Chinaman said \"No savvy,\" but, on the revolver being pointed at his\r\nhead, he handed over the key. Power searched the bag, but took nothing\r\nout. This was the first case.\r\n\r\nOn August 28th, the same mail was bailed up. At that time there were\r\nthree passengers--Mr. Hazleton, Ellen Hart (a servant), and Mrs. Li\r\nGoon. A boy also got on to the coach at Boyd's for a ride down the\r\nhill. The coach had just passed the gap when the driver had to put the\r\nthe break on and pull up, because the roadway was blocked with logs and\r\nsaplings. Mr. Hazleton exclaimed \"Who did this?\" when Power stepped\r\nout from behind a tree and replied \"I did. Put up your hands.\" The\r\npassengers were made to alight and turn out their pockets. Hazleton\r\nmade a step forward to hand his watch and chain to the robber, but\r\nPower cried out \"Stand back,\" and raised his revolver. He then told\r\nHazleton to put the watch on the ground and retire, and when this had\r\nbeen done Power went forward and picked it up. Mrs. Li Goon said she\r\nhad no money, but when Power threatened to shoot her she gave him\r\nfourteen shillings. \"It's all I've got and I'll want a cup of coffee,\"\r\nshe said. \"All right,\" returned the bushranger, \"take this,\" and he\r\ngave her back one shilling. The robber took £2 13s. 6d. out of Coady's\r\npocket-book. There was also a threepenny-piece in it, and Power told\r\nthe coachman to give it to the boy. Mrs. Boyd came down the hill on\r\nhorseback, and was bailed up. She said she had no money. \"I don't see\r\nhow ladies can go riding round with handsome dresses and fine saddles\r\nand bridles without money,\" cried Power. \"Here, give me your horse.\"\r\nMrs. Boyd said if he would allow her to ride home she would bring him\r\nsome money, but he refused to trust to her promise, and took the horse.\r\nHe stuck up several Chinamen and a white man, and took their money from\r\nthem. He said to them \"It's a cold day, but I've got a nice fire down\r\nthere, go and sit by it;\" and he pointed down the hill. He was in a\r\ngood temper and gave the boy a shilling. The little fellow immediately\r\noffered to give him the shilling and the threepenny-piece for his\r\nsister's horse. Power laughed and gave the horse to the boy to lead to\r\nwhere his sister was sitting. This was the second case.\r\n\r\nThe third charge was the robbing of John Whorouly. Power said \"I don't\r\nlike robbing a poor man, but I must have money.\" The fourth charge was\r\nthe sticking up of Thomas Oliver Thomas, on the Buckland Road. When\r\ncalled on to bail up, Thomas wheeled his horse round, and Power shouted\r\n\"If you run away I'll fire. My gun will carry three hundred yards.\"\r\nPower asked for his money, and Thomas replied \"I've got none.\" \"That's\r\na lie,\" cried Power, \"turn it out.\" Power repeatedly threatened Thomas\r\nwith his revolver.\r\n\r\nPower was found guilty on each of the four counts, and was sentenced to\r\nfifteen years' penal servitude.\r\n\r\nPower served out his full sentence. At about the time of his discharge\r\nthe Victorian Government sold the hulk _Success_, the _President_ and\r\nthe other hulks purchased to supply the want of prison accommodation\r\nin \"the roaring fifties\" having been sold years before. The _Success_\r\nhad been utilised as a training ship, and had been kept. In the case\r\nof the other hulks, it had been stipulated in the terms of sale that\r\nthey were to be broken up, but this clause was omitted in the case of\r\nthe _Success_. Consequently she was purchased by some speculators, and\r\nfitted up as a representative convict hulk for exhibition purposes,\r\nand Harry Power was engaged to add interest to the show. The ship was\r\nexhibited in Melbourne, and was then taken round to Sydney. She was\r\nvisited by a number of people during the two or three weeks when she\r\nwas berthed at Circular Quay, and she was then taken down the harbour\r\nto be fitted for a voyage to London. Here she sank at her moorings.\r\nWith the appliances in Sydney so small a vessel was soon raised, but\r\nher immersion had damaged the wax figures intended to represent the\r\nprisoners who had once been confined in her, and the other exhibits.\r\nWhile these were being replaced or cleaned, Harry Power was sent\r\ninto the country districts for the benefit of his health. He was\r\nfishing in the Murray River near Swan Hill, on November 7th, 1891,\r\nwhen he fell in and was drowned. At the inquest held on his body, a\r\nverdict of accidental death was returned. The _Success_ shortly after\r\nleft Australia for England without any living representative of the\r\nbushranging times on board of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n  Bushranging in New Zealand; Alleged fears of the Escort being robbed;\r\n  The First Bushranger, Henry Beresford Garrett; The Maungapatau\r\n  Murders; Arrest of Sullivan, Kelly, Burgess, and Levy in Nelson;\r\n  Sullivan's Confession; The Discovery of the Bodies; Sullivan's\r\n  Release.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reports of extensive and rich discoveries of gold in the Otago\r\nProvince, New Zealand, in 1861, naturally attracted the floating\r\npopulation of Australia to that quarter. In September the escort\r\nbrought down to Dunedin for shipment a smaller amount of \"the precious\r\nmetal\" than had been obtained in any previous month since the goldfield\r\nwas first proclaimed. Several reasons were given to account for this\r\nfalling off. One was that the weather had been abnormally cold, and the\r\nfreezing of the rivers had for a time put a stop to sluicing. Another\r\nwas that the gold buyers declined to pay more than £3 10s. per ounce,\r\nand the majority of the diggers, having come from Ballarat and Bendigo\r\nwhere £4 and £3 18s. 6d. per ounce were paid respectively, refused to\r\nsend their gold down and were keeping it for an anticipated rise in the\r\nprice. The _Southern Cross_, however, said that the principal reason\r\nwhy the diggers were not sending their gold forward was the fear of\r\nbushrangers. The guard sent with the escort was wholly inadequate in\r\nthe mountains through which it had to pass, and therefore the diggers\r\ndeclined to entrust their earnings to its care. The _Otago Witness_\r\npooh-poohed this assertion and declared that there had never yet been a\r\ncase of bushranging in the colony, and that if a fair price was offered\r\nfor it by the banks and other gold buyers the gold retained on the\r\ndiggings would speedily be placed on the market. The bank authorities,\r\non being questioned, said that the New Zealand gold contained a larger\r\nproportion of silver than either the Ballarat or Bendigo gold, and was\r\ntherefore of less value than the gold won on those diggings.\r\n\r\nThe boast of the _Otago Witness_ that there were no bushrangers in New\r\nZealand did not hold good for very long. Henry Beresford Garrett, who\r\nwas arrested in London on the charge of robbing the Bank of Victoria\r\nat Ballarat as already related, and who was convicted in August,\r\n1855, and sentenced to ten years' hard labour, was liberated from the\r\nPentridge Gaol, Melbourne, in August, 1861, on a ticket-of-leave, after\r\nhaving served six years. Early in 1862 he made his appearance as the\r\nfirst bushranger on record in New Zealand. The scene he chose for his\r\noperations was the country between the Otago Goldfields and Dunedin.\r\nIn one day he is reported to have stuck up and robbed no less than\r\ntwenty-three persons near Gabriel's Gully, now known as the town of\r\nLawrence. His career, however, was short if lively, for he was captured\r\nbefore the end of the year and sent to gaol for eight years.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1865, footpads were said to be becoming numerous about\r\nAuckland. The _New Zealand Herald_ reported the story of a man being\r\nbailed up while walking along Beach Street towards Mechanic's Bay. A\r\nsoldier, however, chanced to come along at the time and the robber\r\nbolted. These petty offenders, however, appear to have been speedily\r\ndealt with, and nothing more was heard about bushranging until the\r\npublic was startled by the reports of \"the horrible Maungapatau\r\nmurders,\" as they were called.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Thomas Kelly, alias Noon, Richard H. Burgess, alias\r\nMiller, and Philip Levy went to the new rush known as the West Coast\r\nDiggings, early in 1866, and committed several robberies there. They\r\nwere shortly afterwards joined by John Joseph Sullivan, a recent\r\narrival from Victoria. On June 14th, Stephen Owens, landlord of the\r\nMitre Hotel, Nelson, went to the wharf to meet the coastal steamer\r\n_Wallaby_, as she arrived from the west coast, and saw four men on\r\nboard. They were very shabbily dressed, but he gave one of his cards to\r\nLevy and told him that he and his mates could obtain accommodation at\r\nthe hotel. On the following day, Sullivan and Kelly came to the hotel\r\nin new clothes. Sullivan gave the landlord two bank notes for twenty\r\npounds each, and one ten pound note, and asked him to take care of them\r\nfor him. There was nothing remarkable in this. Diggers were frequently\r\nvery shabby when they returned from the diggings, and until they had\r\ntime to buy new clothes. Sullivan and Kelly appeared to have plenty of\r\nmoney with them, as they spent it freely. They each ordered a pair of\r\ntrousers and a velvet vest from Charles Flood, tailor, paying £4 each\r\nfor them. They also spent £3 17s. 6d. for clothing at Merrington's\r\ndraper's shop, and Kelly paid besides £3 5s. for a dress for a woman.\r\nHe afterwards bought a bonnet, a mantle, and other articles of feminine\r\nwear.\r\n\r\nLevy and Burgess went to lodge at an oyster shop kept by Francis\r\nPorcelli. They were covered with mud when they went there first, but\r\nbought new clothes at J.M. Richardson's and other places in the town.\r\n\r\nOn June 21st, the four men were arrested and charged with the murder\r\nof Felix Mathieu. They were remanded while the police made enquiries.\r\nSullivan turned Queen's evidence, and the tale he told may be\r\nsummarised as follows.\r\n\r\nSullivan landed at the Grey River from Victoria in 1865 with the\r\nintention of digging. He was unlucky, and, chancing to make the\r\nacquaintance of Kelly, Levy, and Burgess, who had been sticking up\r\npeople on the roads about the diggings for several months, he joined\r\nthem. One day they informed him that Mr. E.B. Fox, a gold buyer, of\r\nMaori Gully, was expected to pass along the road, and they intended to\r\nbail him up, as he was sure to have some gold or money on him. Kelly,\r\nLevy, and Burgess hid themselves in some bushes beside the road, while\r\nSullivan was stationed on the road with a long-handled shovel, so that\r\nthose who passed along might take him for a road repairer. Owing to\r\nthis disguise he could keep watch without exciting suspicion. He had\r\nnot been long on watch when a man named George Dobson came along, and\r\nasked how far it was to the coal pits. Sullivan replied \"About half\r\na mile,\" and the man thanked him and walked on. When he was opposite\r\nwhere the other bushrangers were hidden they fired and killed him\r\nunder the belief that he was Fox. When they discovered their mistake\r\nthey dragged the body off the road and buried it, and as it began to\r\nrain heavily they all went to their tent. A day or two later they\r\nwent to the road again, and took up positions as before, Levy giving\r\norders that not a man should be allowed to pass without being searched.\r\nSullivan again appeared as a road-repairer, and was pretending to be at\r\nwork when an old man named James Battle, commonly known in the district\r\nas \"Old Jamie,\" came along with a sluicing shovel on his shoulder.\r\nSullivan said \"Good day, mate. Where are you bound for?\" Old Jamie\r\nreplied that he was going to \"look for a ship,\" as the diggings were\r\n\"played out.\" Sullivan went to the ambush and reported that the man was\r\nan old whaler and not worth robbing, but Levy said he must be brought\r\nback. Sullivan, therefore, followed him and brought him back without\r\ndifficulty, as he had no suspicion. Kelly and Burgess seized him,\r\ntied his hands behind him, and led him away into the bush. When they\r\nreturned they said he would not trouble them any more. They divided £3\r\n15s., which they had taken from the old man. He had informed them that\r\nhe had not done well at the diggings, and had, therefore, taken a job\r\nof cutting flax to earn sufficient money to enable him to get away.\r\n\r\nShortly after Old Jamie had been thus disposed of, Felix Mathieu, John\r\nKempthorne, James Dudley, and James de Pontius, store-keepers and gold\r\nbuyers from the Deep Creek Diggings, passed along the road on their way\r\nfrom Nelson to Canvas Town. Two of the bushrangers stepped out from\r\ntheir ambush and confronted them, calling upon them to stand. They\r\nwheeled their horses, intending to gallop away, but found the other\r\ntwo bushrangers facing them, revolvers in hand. The four travellers\r\nthen surrendered and allowed their hands to be tied behind them. Levy,\r\nBurgess, and Kelly led them away into the bush, while Sullivan followed\r\nthe pack horse which had been let go, and which galloped a short\r\ndistance along the road and then stopped and began to feed. Sullivan\r\nvery soon caught it, and led it off the road. He took the gold and\r\nother valuables out of the portmanteau, which was strapped on the\r\nsaddle, and shot the horse. Then he went to the camp to meet his mates.\r\n\r\nThe four bodies were discovered by William Flett, when he was out\r\nlooking for horses in the bush. They were lying less than half-a-mile\r\nfrom the roadway on the Nelson side of the third creek from Franklyn's\r\nFlat. Mathieu's body was lying in the loose ground broken up by the\r\nuprooting of a large tree by the wind. It was on its back, the hands\r\ntied behind, and the feet tied together at the ankles. It was sheltered\r\nand partially hidden by the upturned roots of the fallen tree. Dudley's\r\nbody was about eighteen yards away with a handkerchief tied tightly\r\nround the throat. Kempthorne's body was some twenty yards further,\r\nlying on its back, untied. The body of De Pontius was lying some thirty\r\nyards further along with a number of stones piled loosely around it,\r\nsuggesting the idea that they had been thrown at it from a short\r\ndistance. Dr. Vickerman said that Kempthorne had been shot in the head\r\nbehind the ear. The bullet and some paper were found in the wound,\r\nshowing that the shot had been fired at close range. Mathieu had been\r\nshot in the stomach, and then stabbed. The wound was under the fifth\r\nrib, and had apparently been made with a large knife. De Pontius had a\r\nbullet-wound in the back of the head, and the right side of the face\r\nwas smashed, as if from the blows of rocks or stones. It was supposed\r\nthat the bullet had not killed him at once, and he was therefore stoned\r\nto death. Dudley had been strangled.\r\n\r\nA revolver was found in the gorse hedge at Toitoi by Constable Peter\r\nLevy. A gun, identified by James Street as one which had been stolen\r\nfrom his place on the Kamieri River, near Hokitiki, in the January\r\nprevious, was also found by the constable not far away.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mathieu identified Levy as a man who had frequently visited her\r\nhusband's store at Deep Creek, and exclaimed when she saw him in the\r\ncourt, \"Oh, Levy, Levy, how could you be such a villain?\"\r\n\r\nThe police ascertained that Sullivan had sold to the banks in Nelson\r\ngold to the value of £106 7s. 6d. Kelly had sold gold to the value of\r\n£76 and a few shillings, and Levy had sold another lot. These, with\r\nthree nuggets which were sold together for £5 3s. 4d., made a total\r\nof about £230 disposed of by the robbers since the murders had been\r\ncommitted. It was, of course, impossible to say what proportion had\r\nbeen stolen from each of the four victims, or whether the whole of it\r\nhad been taken from them.\r\n\r\nGeorge Jervis, a publican at Canvas Town, said that he gave the\r\nprisoners permission to camp in an unoccupied hut not far from his\r\nhotel. When they were leaving Burgess said \"Good-bye, old boy; we're\r\ngoing away from this---- country. There's nothing to be done here.\" The\r\npublican had no suspicion as to the characters of the men, but thought\r\nthat they had not been very lucky recently.\r\n\r\nOld Jamie left the diggings a short time before, and crossed the river.\r\nThe old man was well-known in the district. His body was discovered by\r\nGeorge James Baker, of Nelson, one of the volunteers who accompanied\r\nSergeant Major Shallcross and the police who started out to search for\r\nthe missing men when the murders were first reported. There was some\r\nfreshly-turned up earth near a fern root which attracted Mr. Baker's\r\nattention. A log had been rolled across the place, and on this being\r\nrolled aside and the earth scraped away, a portion of the clothing was\r\nseen. The body was buried in a shallow hole, lying on its back, and\r\nonly just covered with loose earth. The trousers had been torn off, but\r\nthe other clothing remained.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted for three days, Kelly, Levy, and Burgess being found\r\nguilty and sentenced to death on September 17th, 1866. Sullivan was\r\ntried separately on the 19th for the murder of Old Jamie, and a verdict\r\nof guilty was recorded against him. He, however, received a pardon in\r\naccordance with the terms of the Governor's proclamation.\r\n\r\nFelix Mathieu was well-known in Australia. He was a native of\r\nMarseilles, about forty years of age at the time of his death, and\r\nhad been in the colonies about twelve years. On his first arrival he\r\nwas employed as barman at the Union Hotel, Beechworth, after which he\r\nopened a baker's shop at Spring Creek. When the rush took place to the\r\nSnowy River in New South Wales he went there and opened a store, and\r\nlater on he kept a store at the Lambing Flat (Burrangong) and another\r\nat the Lachlan (Forbes). From there he went to the west coast, New\r\nZealand, where he met his death as recorded.\r\n\r\nLevy had been tried at Castlemaine, Victoria, about six years before,\r\non the charge of murdering a woman with whom he was living, but was\r\nacquitted for want of confirmatory evidence.\r\n\r\nSullivan had been transported to Van Diemen's Land, from whence he went\r\nto Victoria in 1853. He opened a butcher's shop at Ironbark Gully,\r\nBendigo, where he was well known. He removed and opened the Half-way\r\nInn on the road between Bendigo and Inglewood. At the time that he\r\nsailed to New Zealand he left his wife in charge of a store at Mount\r\nKorong and sold an allotment of land at Wedderburn to raise money to\r\npay for his trip. He was certainly not driven to crime through want\r\nor poverty, and if, as he said, he was unlucky on the New Zealand\r\ndiggings, he could without much difficulty or delay have obtained\r\nremittances from Victoria which would at least have been sufficient to\r\nenable him to return home.\r\n\r\nAfter his companions in crime had been executed, Sullivan was kept\r\nin gaol for some months, popular feeling being so strong that it was\r\ndeemed inexpedient to release him at once. It was during this time that\r\nhe made some further revelations about his late companions. Soon after\r\nhe joined Burgess, Kelly, and Levy, he said he saw a young man sitting\r\npropped up against the butt of a tree. He was dead. Sullivan asked\r\nwhether the body was to be buried? Kelly replied \"No, better leave it\r\nwhere it is. It will make people think he died from exhaustion. I've\r\nput many a man away like that.\" It was supposed that he referred to the\r\nwild times immediately following the discovery of gold in Victoria. The\r\nyoung man in question had been strangled, and the robbers had taken\r\nfrom his body a silver watch, a gold chain, a compass, a few shillings\r\nin money, and a deposit receipt for £32, which they burned, to prevent\r\nit from turning up in evidence against them.\r\n\r\nSoon after his release he returned to Victoria, but was recognised at\r\nBendigo and other places and boycotted. People refused to sell him\r\nfood or to have any dealings with him whatever. The Government was\r\nurged to put the Criminals' Influx Prevention Act (18 Vict., No. 3) in\r\nforce against him, but his case did not come under the provisions of\r\nthat Act, as he had not been sentenced to penal servitude since his\r\ndeparture from Victoria. He drifted from town to town, and finally made\r\nhis way to Sydney, from whence, it was said, he went to South America\r\nand was lost to sight.\r\n\r\nThe story of bushranging in New Zealand further illustrates the\r\nintimate relationship between the colonies to which I have already\r\nreferred. Garrett, the first New Zealand bushranger, was an old\r\nVictorian criminal, and the Maungapatau murderers, with whom the record\r\nterminates, also went to the islands from the same colony, some of\r\nthem, if not all, having been previously transported from Great Britain\r\nto Van Diemen's Land.\r\n\r\nIt may be advisable here, perhaps, to say a few words with regard\r\nto Sullivan's evidence. The point in it to which I wish to draw\r\nthe attention of the reader is the partial exculpation of himself.\r\nSubstantially, the confession was no doubt correct, but we have only\r\nSullivan's own word to prove that the murders were committed by his\r\ncompanions and that he himself only shot a horse. We notice a similar\r\neffort on the part of Daniel Charters and others who have turned\r\nQueen's evidence to minimise the share they took in the outrages with\r\nwhich they were charged. Charters, indeed, went rather further than the\r\nmajority of informers and stated that he was sent away to take care of\r\nthe horses while the escort was robbed, because he was too frightened\r\nto \"risk his---- skin.\" He thus openly admitted his cowardice in order\r\napparently to justify himself, to himself, for turning informer. Of\r\ncourse, his evidence may have been true in this particular, but the\r\nconstancy of this principle in informers generally of claiming that\r\nthey merely took a very secondary share in the crimes which they are\r\nthe means of bringing home to their fellows, tends to raise a suspicion\r\nthat they do, as a rule, consciously or unconsciously, endeavour to\r\nexcuse themselves to the public, and perhaps also to themselves, as a\r\nsort of relief perhaps to their own conscience, for turning informer.\r\nTheir action in this respect contrasts strongly with that of men like\r\nPierce, the cannibal, or John Lynch, in making confessions after they\r\nhave been convicted. In these and other cases which might be cited the\r\ncondemned man appears to be anxious to let the public know how very\r\nbad their actions have been. I do not say that they exaggerate their\r\ncrimes, but merely that they are particular that even the smallest\r\nfacts shall be made public. At the same time, they endeavour to satisfy\r\ntheir own consciences in some way or other for what they have done.\r\nPierce, for instance, excused himself by saying that he must either\r\nhave killed and eaten his companions or starved, although this is not\r\nborne out by the facts as far as they are known of his last act of\r\ncannibalism. Lynch, on the other hand, endeavoured to prove that he\r\nwas the instrument of divine vengeance, that he had a mission. But,\r\nwhatever the excuse put forward may be, the fact remains that they take\r\ncare that their crimes shall be known to the very smallest particulars.\r\nThis point is I think worthy of the investigation of the criminologist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n  Bushranging in Queensland; Some Bushrangers from Over the Southern\r\n  Border; A Bogus Ben Hall; The Wild Scotchman; Queensland's Only\r\n  Bushranger; A Man of Many Aliases; He goes to Fight a Duel with Sir\r\n  Frederick Pottinger; He Escapes from the Steamer; Recaptured and\r\n  Tried.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was still another of the Australian colonies which was affected\r\nby the evil influence of the bushranging mania inaugurated by Frank\r\nGardiner. This colony was Queensland. In May, 1864, Harry, the\r\nmail-man, was travelling along the road between Bodumba and Leyburn,\r\nwhen he was stopped by an old man and a boy, one of whom asked him,\r\ncivilly enough, which was the road to Warwick. Harry, very obligingly,\r\npulled up to tell them where to turn off, when the old man drew a\r\npistol and ordered him to dismount. Harry protested against this\r\noutrage, and said he was a Government employé, but this only produced\r\na reiteration of the order with a threat to blow out his brains if\r\nhe did not obey. He then dismounted, and was tied very tightly, the\r\nrobbers paying no attention whatever to his complaints that the rope\r\nwas cutting his wrists. The robbers went through the bags, which they\r\nleft on the ground, and, when they had finished, the old man mounted\r\nHarry's horse, while the boy climbed on to the packhorse, and rode\r\naway. Harry, who was left lying on the ground, rolled himself over and\r\nover to where there were some jagged rocks by the side of the road.\r\nSelecting the one with the sharpest edge, he wriggled about until he\r\ngot the rope across it, and then moved his body backwards and forwards\r\nuntil the strands of the rope which bound his hands together behind\r\nhis back parted. Having freed his hands, he soon untied the rope round\r\nhis legs and walked to Goondiwindi, where he reported the robbery to\r\nthe police. The _Brisbane Courier_ in reporting this robbery said it\r\nwas the first case of bushranging that had taken place in Queensland,\r\nand hoped that that colony was not about to have its peace disturbed\r\nas that of the southern colonies had recently been by bushrangers. The\r\n_Courier_, of course, did not consider the convicts who escaped into\r\nthe bush when Moreton Bay was a penal settlement as bushrangers in the\r\nmodern acceptation of the term. Some of the more notorious of these\r\nhave already been dealt with in Chapter XV., but if we accept the new\r\nmeaning of the term \"bushranger,\" the _Courier_ was, no doubt, correct\r\nin its assertion that this was the first case that had occurred in the\r\ncolony. Of course a rumour was raised that the perpetrator was Gilbert\r\nand some of his gang, but the description given of the robbers shows\r\nthat this rumour was absurd.\r\n\r\nAbout a month later a bushranger named Wright stuck up and robbed a\r\nnumber of people in the Rockhampton district. He was speedily followed\r\nby the police and some black trackers, and was shot, early in July,\r\nat Wipend, on the Mackenzie River, a few miles off of the Peak Downs\r\nRoad. He was riding a racehorse which he had stolen from Mr. Cranston,\r\na squatter of that district.\r\n\r\nIn September a man entered the bar of the Shearers' Arms Inn at\r\nKnebsworth, and cried out \"Bail up! I'm Ben Hall!\" The proprietor, Mr.\r\nPhilip Hardy, took a revolver out of a drawer under the counter. The\r\nbushranger, seeing him do this, fired, and missed. Mr. Hardy returned\r\nthe fire, and wounded the bushranger. The landlord ran round from\r\nbehind the bar, collared his assailant, and after a struggle thrust him\r\ninto a back room. Having locked the door and made his prisoner secure,\r\nas he thought, Mr. Hardy ran to the police station to report. He\r\nreturned in a few minutes accompanied by a constable, but the bird had\r\nflown. The window of the room in which he had been shut was wide open,\r\nso that the bushranger had merely to step out and walk away. It is\r\nprobable therefore that he was making his way to the bush at the back\r\nof the house almost as soon as the door was locked. He lost his horse,\r\nhowever, as the animal was hitched to the verandah post in front, and\r\nwas taken away by the constable.\r\n\r\nOne or two other cases occurred, but they were all of a paltry\r\ncharacter, until the Celtic blood of Alpin Macpherson, alias John\r\nBruce, alias Mar, alias Kerr, alias Scotia or Scotchie, generally\r\nknown as the Wild Scotchman, was stirred to emulate the heroic deeds\r\nof Hall, Gilbert and Co. Macpherson was born in Scotland and was taken\r\nto Queensland when very young by his father. The elder Macpherson\r\nworked for Mr. McConnell at Cressbrook and was generally respected by\r\nthose who knew him. His son Alpin was sent to school in the town and\r\nwas a favourite with his teachers on account of his diligence. When\r\nold enough he was apprenticed to Mr. Petrie, a stonemason in Brisbane,\r\nand was again well-liked by his master and the members of his family.\r\nAlpin was a diligent reader and a fluent speaker. He became a prominent\r\nmember of the Debating Class in the Brisbane Mechanics' School of\r\nArts. When Mr. Lilley, afterwards Attorney-General, was attacked at\r\na political meeting at the Valley, with mud, over-ripe tomatoes, and\r\nother missiles, on account of his Militia Bill, which was strongly\r\nopposed, young Macpherson defended him bravely, receiving some bruises.\r\nSoon afterwards, without any apparent reason, he ran away from his\r\napprenticeship and took to the roads. He began his bushranging career\r\nby sticking up Wills's Hotel on the Houghton River, after the manner\r\npopular with the Hall and Gilbert gang. From thence he went to New\r\nSouth Wales to \"fight a duel with Sir Frederick Pottinger,\" the head\r\nof the police force in that colony. This determination he announced\r\nhimself. The records of this portion of his career are somewhat\r\nobscure. It is known that he did exchange shots with Sir Frederick\r\nPottinger and some troopers, and that he received a slight wound, but\r\nit is doubtful whether he ever joined Hall and Gilbert, and committed\r\nrobberies in their company, as he said he did. However, he did not\r\nremain in New South Wales very long. He returned to Queensland and\r\nrobbed the mails, stuck up travellers, stole racehorses, and otherwise\r\nendeavoured to work up to the standard ideal of the real Australian\r\nbushranger.\r\n\r\nHe had been thus employed for some months when Mr. W. Nott, manager of\r\nthe Manduran station, saw him in a paddock belonging to the station,\r\nand recognised him. Believing that he was there with the intention\r\nof stealing some of the horses, Mr. Nott hastily collected a party\r\nand started in pursuit. The party consisted of Messrs. Nott, Curry,\r\nGadsden, and J. Walsh. They came in sight of their quarry about five\r\nmiles away, as he was travelling along the Port Curtis Road. He was\r\nriding slowly when first seen, but, on observing the pursuers closing\r\nupon him, Macpherson let go his packhorse, wheeled off the road, and\r\ngalloped down the side of a steep range. His pursuers followed. When he\r\nreached the level ground at the foot of the range, the Wild Scotchman\r\npulled up, and began to unstrap the double-barrelled gun which he\r\ncarried across the pommel of his saddle. Before he could succeed,\r\nhowever, Mr. Nott came close up and cried \"Put up your hands or I'll\r\nfire.\" The rifle barrel was only a few feet away, and as the other men\r\ncame up at once with arms ready for use the Wild Scotchman yielded.\r\n\"All right,\" he said, \"I give up.\" \"I knew you were not policemen,\" he\r\nsaid later, \"by the way you came down that ridge, but you wouldn't have\r\ncaught me if my horse had not been done up.\" They took away his arms,\r\nand then returned to the station, two of the captors riding with the\r\nbushranger between them, while the other two rode close behind. In the\r\npack on the horse which he abandoned was found a beautifully-fitted\r\ncase of surgical instruments, with lint and other necessaries for\r\ntreating wounds. He also carried a pocket compass, an American axe, and\r\nsome other useful articles. The axe was required for cutting fences or\r\nfor making temporary stockyards to catch horses in.\r\n\r\nA warrant had been issued for his arrest for his attack on Sir\r\nFrederick Pottinger and the police in New South Wales, and the Wild\r\nScotchman was therefore extradited to stand his trial in New South\r\nWales on a charge of shooting with intent to do grievous bodily harm.\r\nHis arrival in Sydney was coincident with the resignation of that\r\nofficer as already related. Sir Frederick, however, was summoned to\r\nappear against him, and it was on his journey to Sydney for this\r\npurpose that the accident happened which put an end to Sir Frederick's\r\nlife and the prosecution against the Wild Scotchman at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Scotchman was returned to Queensland in charge of the police.\r\nHe was sent from Brisbane to Port Denison, and was there committed for\r\ntrial and remanded to Rockhampton, the nearest assize town, for that\r\npurpose. He was shipped on board the steamer _Diamantina_ in charge of\r\nConstable Maher. He was accommodated with leg irons, his hands being so\r\nsmall that he could easily slip them through any ordinary handcuffs.\r\nIn fact he boasted freely that the handcuffs to hold him \"had not yet\r\nbeen made.\" When the steamer reached Mackay he was seated reading near\r\nthe galley, but he had behaved so quietly all through the earlier part\r\nof the passage that the constable did not think it necessary to disturb\r\nhim by taking him below. There was, of course, the usual bustle while\r\nthe steamer was at the wharf, and Constable Maher appears to have lost\r\nsight of his prisoner, and did not miss him until the vessel had been\r\nan hour at sea. Then a search was instituted, but no Wild Scotchman\r\ncould be found, and as the _Maryborough Chronicle_ remarked, \"Constable\r\nMaher reached Rockhampton minus his prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nHow he got ashore and removed his leg-irons was a mystery which was not\r\nsolved for some time. However, his escape did not profit him much. He\r\nwent to a paddock on the Kolongo station with the intention of stealing\r\na horse to enable him to stick up the mail coach, and \"make a rise.\"\r\nBut a party was organised by Mr. Hall, and he was recaptured without\r\nattaining his purpose. This time greater care was exercised by the\r\npolice to whom he was handed over, and he reached Rockhampton, where he\r\nwas tried on several charges of highway robbery and sentenced to twenty\r\nyears' penal servitude.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that young Macpherson, like many other\r\nhigh-spirited young men, was led away by the glamour which gathered\r\nround the bushrangers Hall, Gilbert, and their young associates; and\r\nwhich appears to have appealed so strongly to the youth of certain\r\ntemperaments as to blind them to the enormity of the crimes committed\r\nby these bushrangers. The quiet bush life in Australia afforded them\r\nno escape valve by which their desire for excitement might be worked\r\noff. They did not pause to realise that their fight against society\r\nwas hopeless from the beginning, and that in taking to the bush they\r\nwere setting themselves, almost single handed, against the whole\r\nforce of public opinion in the colony. Had they lived in Europe they\r\nmight, perhaps, have enlisted in the army and thus been able to do\r\nsomething to satisfy their cravings for notoriety and adventure in a\r\nlegitimate way. In Australia, however, there was no standing army, and\r\neven if there had been there was nothing for it to do in the colonies,\r\nand no chance of its ever being employed outside, where hard blows\r\nwere to be struck and glory won. It may be true that even soldiers\r\ndo not always find congenial work for them to do, and that many of\r\nthem have lived very humdrum lives, but there is always the hope that\r\nthey may be called on to defend their country, or to fight for its\r\naggrandisement, and this hope is sufficient to induce them to enlist,\r\nwhen they are brought under the control of the disciplinarian and kept\r\nout of mischief until their boyish enthusiasm subsides and they are\r\nold enough to enter into the business of life. However, Queensland's\r\n\"only bushranger,\" the Wild Scotchman, was captured after a brief but\r\nexciting career of about eighteen months, and the colony has not been\r\ntroubled by bushrangers since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n  Captain Moonlite; The \"Reverend Gentleman\" Robs the Bank, and Nearly\r\n  Makes his Escape; He Breaks out of Ballarat Gaol; He Becomes a\r\n  Reformed Character; He Sticks Up Wantabadgery Station; A Desperate\r\n  Battle with the Police; Moonlite is Captured; His Young Companions in\r\n  Crime; Sentenced to Death; The Wild Horse Hunters Turn Bushrangers;\r\n  An Abortive Attempt to Rob a Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom about June, 1872, to April, 1878, or nearly six years, Australia\r\nwas free from bushrangers. With the exception of the two or three\r\nrobberies in the far west of New South Wales, so far west as to be\r\nalmost out of the colony, the roads were safe; travellers journeyed in\r\nall directions without fear of molestation; and the public, as well\r\nas the authorities, began to congratulate themselves once more on\r\nhaving at length definitely stamped out the scourge of bushranging.\r\nSince the shooting of Thunderbolt and the capture of Power, there\r\nhad been no sign of a recrudescence of the crime, and bushranging\r\nwas beginning to be referred to as belonging to a past age. But this\r\npeaceful condition of the country was not always to continue. The old\r\nleaven of convictism so frequently referred to, had not as yet been\r\nso completely eliminated as the public and the authorities hoped and\r\nbelieved. Reports began to spread about in 1878 that robberies had been\r\ncommitted in the neighbourhood where Power had so long set the police\r\nat defiance, and shortly afterwards the name of Ned Kelly began to be\r\nassociated with them. Ned Kelly is still spoken of as the last of the\r\nbushrangers, and as his death closes the story, it may be as well to\r\ndeal with some other bushrangers who finished their careers before\r\n\"the gentleman of the Strathbogie Ranges.\" The most remarkable of these\r\nwas George Scott, alias Captain Moonlite. His story belongs partly\r\nto the former era, but I have reserved it in order to make it more\r\ncomplete than would have been possible had it been divided. Scott was\r\nborn in the North of Ireland, and emigrated to Victoria. He went to the\r\ndiggings at a time when agents from New Zealand were endeavouring to\r\nraise a corps in Victoria for service against the Maoris. He enlisted\r\nand fought through the war in 1861-65, being wounded in the leg. On\r\nhis return to Victoria he showed a strong desire to join the Church,\r\nand as he was well educated and a good speaker he was appointed lay\r\nreader at Bacchus Marsh, with a view to his being ordained a minister\r\nof the Church of England, when the Bishop of Melbourne should consider\r\nhim worthy of the charge. His duties as lay reader were to travel\r\nround the settlement, to read prayers and conduct services, his head\r\nquarters being in the town at Mount Egerton. His chief friends here\r\nwere the manager of the Union Bank and the schoolmaster. He soon came\r\nto be respected and liked in the district. One night, however, a masked\r\nman walked into the living apartments connected with the bank and\r\nordered the manager, who was alone, to bail up. The manager recognised\r\nthe voice and asked him whether he thought this a suitable practical\r\njoke for a clergyman. Scott replied that he would soon find it was no\r\njoke. He threatened to shoot the manager unless he surrendered and did\r\nas he was ordered. He then gagged the manager, took him across the\r\nstreet to the school-house, and compelled him to sign the following\r\nstatement:--\"Captain Moonlite has stuck me up and robbed the bank.\"\r\nThere was no one at the school-house, Scott having apparently timed his\r\nvisit when he knew the school would be empty. Leaving the paper on the\r\ndesk in the school-house, Scott took the manager back to the bank, tied\r\nhim hand and foot, and then took about £1000 worth in notes and coin\r\nfrom the safe. The schoolmaster found the paper lying on the desk when\r\nhe went to open the school next morning, and at first did not know what\r\nto make of it. He handed it to the police, who, on going to the bank,\r\nfound the manager gagged and tied. Having heard his story the police\r\nconsidered it absurd, and arrested the manager and schoolmaster as\r\nhaving been jointly concerned in the crime. The idea of charging the\r\nminister, as Scott was generally called, appeared to be preposterous,\r\nthe more especially as Scott was very active in trying to find\r\nincriminating evidence against his quondam friends. Being intimately\r\nacquainted with the lives led by the two men, he was able to supply the\r\npolice with several facts, true or false, which were considered strong\r\ncircumstantial proofs of their guilt. They were committed for trial,\r\nScott being bound over as a witness against them. He did not wait for\r\nthe trial, however, but went to Sydney, where he put up at one of the\r\nleading hotels and spent money lavishly. He represented himself as a\r\nwealthy visitor to the colonies travelling for pleasure, and spoke of\r\nhis intention to visit some of the South Sea Islands. For this purpose\r\nhe purchased a yacht, for which he paid partly in cash and partly by a\r\ncheque for £150. This cheque was returned by the bank on which it was\r\ndrawn as valueless, and the man who had sold him the yacht immediately\r\ncommunicated with the police. Scott had already set sail, but the\r\npolice followed him in a steam launch and caught him just outside the\r\nHeads. He was brought back and tried for fraud and was sent to gaol for\r\neighteen months.\r\n\r\nEven the flight of Scott from Mount Egerton did not at first convince\r\nthe police and others of his guilt in connection with the bank robbery,\r\nbut without his evidence the case against the bank manager and the\r\nschoolmaster was so weak that it broke down, and they were discharged.\r\nLater on a warrant was issued for the arrest of Scott, alias Captain\r\nMoonlite, but he was then in gaol in New South Wales. On his release\r\nhe was rearrested, and extradited to Victoria to be tried for the bank\r\nrobbery. He was taken to Ballarat, and lodged in the newly-built gaol,\r\na most substantial structure of blue stone (basalt). The building\r\nstands in a large courtyard, surrounded by a wall twenty-five feet\r\nhigh, also constructed of basalt. Looked at from the outside it appears\r\nto be one of the most hopeless places for a prisoner to escape from\r\nimaginable, but Scott had been educated as an engineer, and therefore\r\nwhat might have been impossible for another man was not so for him.\r\nThere was a wooden partition which divided one cell into two. Scott\r\nwas imprisoned awaiting trial in one portion of the cell, and a man\r\nnamed Dermoodie in the other portion. Scott cut through this partition,\r\nand with the aid of Dermoodie contrived to take the lock off the door.\r\nThe two men walked into the corridor and hid in a dark corner until\r\nthe warder came round, when Scott sprang on him, grasped him by the\r\nthroat, and with the assistance of Dermoodie gagged and tied him.\r\nScott then took the keys, and having shut the warder into the cell,\r\nwith the door closed, so that any other warder in passing it would\r\nnot notice that it had been opened, walked down the passage. With the\r\nkeys he opened four more cells and liberated the prisoners in them.\r\nHe made them take the blankets from their beds and follow him, after\r\ncarefully closing the doors again. He opened the door leading into\r\nthe great yard and went to a dark corner under the wall where he tore\r\nthe blankets into strips and tied them together to form a rope. Scott\r\nthen stood up against the wall. One of the other men climbed up and\r\nstood on his shoulders, another climbed up and stood on his, and so on\r\nuntil the last, Dermoodie, was able to take the rope and sit on the\r\nwall. With the aid of the rope each man was enabled to go up in turn to\r\nwhere Dermoodie was, and was then lowered down on the other side. Here\r\nthey stood on each others' shoulders as before, to enable Dermoodie to\r\nclimb down, then the others followed in turn, and they were free. The\r\nsouth-eastern corner of the gaol wall stands near the edge of the hill\r\nwhere the ground slopes sharply down to Golden Gully. The six men went\r\ndown the slope to a safe distance, and then Scott said they must part,\r\nas they would have a better chance of getting away separately than if\r\nthey all kept together. The four men liberated by Scott to help him\r\nover the wall were speedily caught, some in Ballarat and the others\r\nnot far away, but as they were not bushrangers we have nothing further\r\nto do with them. Scott and Dermoodie went away together and slept in\r\nthe bush. Scott said they must have money, and proposed to rob a bank,\r\nwhich he said could be easily done, but Dermoodie said he had only been\r\narrested for a small offence, and he had made his case bad enough by\r\nescaping. He did not wish to make it worse. Scott called him a coward,\r\na contemptible cur, and said he should never leave that spot alive. He\r\ngave him five minutes to say his prayers. He was in a terrible rage,\r\nbut before the five minutes were over he said that Dermoodie was not\r\nworth killing, gave him a few kicks and blows, and ordered him out of\r\nhis sight, an order which was quickly obeyed. Dermoodie went back to\r\nBallarat and was recaptured a day or two after his escape, while Scott\r\nwas found about a week later in a hut near Bendigo. He was tried, and\r\nwas sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for the bank robbery, and to\r\none years' imprisonment in irons for breaking gaol.\r\n\r\nScott behaved in the most exemplary manner while he was in Pentridge,\r\nand contrived to convince both the chaplain and the gaol authorities\r\nthat he intended to live \"on the square\" for the future. He was allowed\r\nall the remission possible under the rules for good conduct, and was\r\nreleased in March, 1879. He was a forcible and fluent speaker, and he\r\nmade a living by open-air lecturing in Melbourne on prison discipline\r\nand other subjects. About this time the Kelly gang was at the zenith of\r\nits career, when suddenly Scott disappeared from his usual haunts in\r\nMelbourne. Probably his imagination was stirred by the reports current\r\nabout the Kellys; perhaps he was prompted by jealousy of their doings;\r\nor, perhaps, by a sudden desire for notoriety. However this may be, he\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, November 15th, 1879, at about three p.m., six armed men\r\nrode up to Mr. C.F.J. Macdonald's station at Wantabadgery, on the\r\nMurrumbidgee River, New South Wales, and bailed up all the men at\r\nwork there. Nineteen men were collected from various places about the\r\nstation and marched into the dining-room of Mr. Macdonald's house. Mr.\r\nMiles was then ordered to unlock the door of the store, and the robbers\r\nselected a quantity of clothing and other goods which they required or\r\nfancied. They were engaged in packing these on some spare horses when\r\nMr. Weir, of Eurongilly, and a schoolmaster rode up, and were called on\r\nto bail up. The schoolmaster refused, and one of the bushrangers loudly\r\ndeclared that he would shoot him. Hearing the altercation, the leader\r\nof the gang came out of the store, seized the schoolmaster by the leg,\r\nand dragged him from the horse, saying at the same time, \"You---- old\r\nfool, get down and do as you're told. I'm Moonlite.\" He pushed the\r\nschoolmaster along, and forced him to go into the dining-room where the\r\nother men were sitting.\r\n\r\nTowards evening Mr. Baynes, the manager of the station, returned from\r\na back station, and was bailed up and conducted to the dining-room.\r\nThe women had been told that they would not be interfered with, and\r\nwere ordered to cook dinner. When it was ready it was served in the\r\ndining-room, where all partook of the food, the bushrangers sitting\r\ndown in turn, while two remained on guard. After the meal some grog,\r\nobtained from the station store, was served round, and Mr. Macdonald\r\nwas permitted to retire to bed. The others remained at the table all\r\nnight, the bushrangers taking it in turn to sleep like the others with\r\ntheir heads on the table.\r\n\r\nBreakfast on the following (Sunday) morning was taken as supper had\r\nbeen on the previous evening. During the meal Mr. Baynes said to one\r\nof the young bushrangers who was seated near him, \"This is bad work.\"\r\nMoonlite, who was sitting on the other side of the large table, heard\r\nhim and jumped up. He charged Mr. Baynes with trying to tamper with his\r\nmen, and swore that he would shoot him. He seemed to be in a paroxysm\r\nof rage, and flourished his revolver about in a dangerous manner. The\r\nwomen, however, clustered round, assuring him that Mr. Baynes did not\r\nmean any harm, and begging him to spare him. In a few minutes Scott's\r\nrage had evaporated, and he sat down again and went on with his meal\r\napparently oblivious of Mr. Baynes's presence. During the morning\r\nseveral men came to the station, and were bailed up and marched into\r\nthe dining-room. One of these men was leading a young filly which had\r\nonly recently been broken in. Scott admired her very much and said,\r\n\"She'll just suit me.\" He led her round and then tried to mount her,\r\nbut she was very skittish and would not let him. This threw him into a\r\npassion and he became violent, thus frightening the filly and making\r\nher more ungovernable. At length he swore that if she did not stand\r\nstill he would shoot her, and as she continued to rear and try to get\r\naway he drew his revolver and sent a bullet through her head. When\r\nhis fit of passion had passed off, Moonlite said he was sorry he had\r\nkilled the mare, but she should have stood still when he told her. He\r\nthen ordered Lindon, the groom, to put the horses into the buggy, and,\r\ntaking Mr. Alexander Macdonald as a hostage, drove to the house of the\r\nsuperintendent of the station, Mr. Reid. Here he obtained a Whitworth\r\nrifle and some ammunition. He then forced Mr. and Mrs. Reid to mount\r\nthe buggy, and drove away to Paterson's Australian Arms Hotel, which\r\nhe stuck up, taking two shot guns and a revolver. He ordered Mr. and\r\nMrs. Paterson to walk to the station, and, to ensure obedience, put\r\ntheir two little children into the buggy and drove away. On the return\r\njourney to the station he stuck up seven more men, and compelled\r\nthem to march in front of the buggy to the station, and go into the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\nAs Moonlite jumped down from the buggy he caught sight of Mr. Baynes\r\nstanding on the verandah. He rushed across to him, and charged him with\r\nattempting to corrupt his men. He ordered Mr. Baynes to be pinioned\r\nwith a fishing line, and had him lifted into the buggy, saying \"I'll\r\ndrive under that tree and you can tie the rope to the limb, and we'll\r\nleave this gentlemen hanging there.\" A rope was tied round Mr. Baynes's\r\nneck ready, but the women, seeing these preparations for a tragedy,\r\nagain gathered round Moonlite and begged him to let Mr. Baynes go.\r\nAt first he refused, saying \"The gentleman does not deserve it,\" but\r\ngradually he became less violent, and finally ordered Baynes to be\r\nuntied. Then he called a muster of all the men in the dining-room and\r\ncounted thirty-five.\r\n\r\nAfter having given orders as to the custody of his prisoners, Moonlite\r\nmounted a horse and rode round, going for some distance along the road\r\non each side of the homestead. He met a man coming from the adjoining\r\nstation, Eurongilly, where he worked. \"Hulloa,\" cried Moonlite,\r\n\"where are you going with that pistol?\" \"To fight the bushrangers,\"\r\nreplied the man. \"By G----,\" exclaimed Scott, \"you've found them,\r\nhere we are. Hand over that revolver and we'll try you for unlawfully\r\ncarrying firearms.\" The man was compelled to obey, and was taken into\r\nthe dining-room. Moonlite took his seat as judge, having appointed\r\ntwo of his mates and two of the station hands as jury, and the trial\r\nwas carried out as nearly in the orthodox manner as circumstances\r\nwould permit. The charge was read by the clerk, witnesses were heard\r\nand cross-examined; the judge summed up, and the verdict returned\r\nwas \"Not guilty.\" Scott turned to the prisoner and said, \"You may\r\nthink yourself---- lucky. If the jury had found you guilty, I'd have\r\ngiven you five minutes to live.\" He then ordered the prisoner to be\r\ndischarged, and said it was dinner time.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the vigilance of the bushrangers relaxed so far that\r\nAlexander Macdonald contrived to make his escape. He got a horse and\r\nrode to Wagga Wagga, twenty-five miles away. He informed the police\r\nof what had taken place, and Constables Howe, Hedley, Williamson, and\r\nJohns saddled their horses and started back with him to Wantabadgery,\r\nwhere they arrived at four a.m. on Monday morning. The robbers were\r\nstill in possession, and the police hoped to find them unprepared,\r\nbut this was not the case, and the police retreated to Mr. James\r\nBeveridge's station, Tarrandera Park, where they obtained fresh horses.\r\nBy this time five more troopers had arrived from Gundagai, sixty-five\r\nmiles away, and the police decided that they were strong enough to\r\nbegin the attack. The people who had been detained in the dining-room\r\nspeedily made their escape and collected on a ridge a short distance\r\nfrom the scene of battle, other persons, attracted by the sound of\r\nthe firing, rode up from the stations round until some three hundred\r\nspectators of the fight were collected on the ridge, but they left the\r\npolice to do the fighting unaided. Constable Bowen, who had already\r\nshot a bushranger in the Thunderbolt rising, was the first to make any\r\nimpression, and a great cheer went up as one of Moonlite's men was\r\nseen to fall. The bushrangers went into the house, and the police took\r\nshelter in a hut some distance away. They advanced very cautiously, and\r\nConstable Bowen shot a second man, falling wounded himself almost at\r\nthe same time. Some time afterwards Constable Carroll, who had crept\r\nclose up to the verandah, in spite of the heavy fusilade which was kept\r\nup, shot a third bushranger, and soon after the other three came out\r\nand surrendered. Moonlite asked Mr. Wise to go for a doctor to attend\r\nto Nesbit, saying \"Poor fellow! He was shot trying to save me.\"\r\n\r\nJames Nesbit, alias Lyons, who was shot dead, was born in Melbourne\r\nand was twenty-three years of age. Augustus or Gus Wernicke (also from\r\nMelbourne), aged nineteen, died a few days after the battle. Graham\r\nBennett, also born in Victoria, was twenty years of age. He was wounded\r\nin the arm and recovered. Thomas Williams, alias Jones, nineteen years\r\nold, was born in Ballarat, Victoria. Thomas Rogan was born at Hay, New\r\nSouth Wales, but had been living for some years in Melbourne, where he\r\nbecame acquainted with Scott. Scott, the leader, was thirty-seven years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nConstable Bowen died of his wound on the Sunday following the fight,\r\nand the prisoners were tried on the charge of murdering him. The trial\r\ntook place at Darlinghurst Court House, Sydney, and lasted for four\r\ndays. A verdict of guilty was returned, but the jury recommended Rogan,\r\nBennett, and Williams to mercy on account of their youth and the belief\r\nthat they had been led into crime by Scott. In consequence of this the\r\nsentences on Bennett and Williams were commuted to imprisonment for\r\nlife, but although some pressure was brought to bear on the Governor,\r\nLord Augustus Loftus, the executive declined to extend mercy to Rogan.\r\nHe and Scott were therefore hung in Darlinghurst gaol.\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses at the trial, named Ah Goon, said that he had been\r\nrobbed of a gold watch and chain valued at £25. When taking these and\r\nsome money from him, Scott said he was \"a---- Chinaman who took the\r\nbread out of the mouths of honest workers.\" It is worthy of note also\r\nthat on the second day of the trial of the prisoners at Darlinghurst,\r\nthe _Melbourne Argus_ reported that James P. Nesbitt, father of the\r\nrecently killed bushranger, was charged at the City Police Court,\r\nMelbourne, with having thrashed and abused his wife, the mother of the\r\nbushranger. He was ordered to be bound over to keep the peace for six\r\nmonths under a penalty of £25, and as the money was not forthcoming, he\r\nwas sent to gaol.\r\n\r\nThe gallantry of the police in breaking up this gang of bushrangers\r\nat so early a stage in its career was duly recognised. The police\r\nauthorities voted a reward of £100 to Constable Carroll, £75 to\r\nConstable Curran, and £50 each to the other constables engaged in\r\nthe fight. A public monument was erected to Constable Bowen, and\r\na pension was settled on his wife, while the Government undertook\r\nthe care and education of his children. The police were paraded in\r\nSydney; the Inspector General, Mr. E. Fosbery, read a letter from the\r\nColonial Secretary (the late Sir Henry Parkes) publicly thanking the\r\npolice constables for their services. After this ceremony, the purses\r\ncontaining the rewards were presented and acknowledged.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to divide the bushranging of this epoch so as to keep\r\nthe story of the different colonies concerned separate as I have in the\r\nprevious epochs, because both the Moonlite and the Kelly gang operated\r\nin both Victoria and New South Wales. The small number of bushrangers\r\nwho worked separately from these gangs are not worth dividing and may\r\nbe dealt with here.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1879, three young men who had been engaged in running\r\nin and capturing warrigal horses on the lower Murrumbidgee, thought,\r\nperhaps, that that employment was less profitable than bushranging,\r\nand took to the roads. Their names were Thomas Gorman (twenty-one),\r\nCharles Jones (twenty), and William Kaye (nineteen). They bailed up\r\na few travellers on the road between Balranald and Ivanhoe, and were\r\nthen joined by William Hobbs, otherwise known as Hoppy Bill, because\r\nhe had a crooked leg and arm. Hobbs had been employed as cook at the\r\nHatfield sheep station, and was about thirty years of age. On the 21st\r\nthey stuck up Mr. Grainger's store at Hatfield, about sixty miles north\r\nof Balranald, and stole £50 worth of clothing and other goods, two\r\nhorses, with saddles and bridles. On the following day they stopped a\r\nhawker, saying \"Bail up. We're the Kellys,\" and took £40 worth of goods\r\nand jewellery from his waggon. On the 23rd they arrived at Till Till\r\nstation, and bailed up twenty-five persons there. Mrs. Crombie, wife of\r\nthe manager, was very much frightened at first, but they soothed her by\r\ntelling her that they \"wouldn't hurt any one.\" They took six horses, a\r\nquantity of ammunition, and some other articles from the store. When\r\nthey left they said that they intended to stick up Woolpagerie station.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mr. John Thomas Day, storeman at Grainger's, travelled\r\nas fast as his horse could go to Moulamein, and informed the police of\r\nthe sticking up of the store. He was sworn in as a special constable,\r\nand accompanied by troopers Beresford and Powers and a black tracker,\r\nstarted in pursuit. They rode one hundred and eighty miles between nine\r\na.m. on Sunday and seven p.m. on Monday, changing horses at Clare,\r\nwhere they came on the tracks of the bushrangers. On their arrival\r\nat Kilferra Mr. Casey supplied them with remounts, and joined in the\r\nchase. The tracks led down to the Four Mile Dam, where the pursuers\r\ncame on the bushrangers in camp preparing their supper. As they went\r\nforward the bushrangers came to meet them, crying out, \"Bail up.\" The\r\npolice replied, \"Surrender in the Queen's name.\" Both parties fired,\r\nand Constable Powers fell wounded in the shoulder. The bushrangers then\r\nthrew down their arms and surrendered. They were tried on April 19th\r\nfor shooting with intent to murder, and were found guilty. When asked\r\nif they had anything to urge why sentence of death should not be passed\r\non them, Hobbs was the only one who spoke, and he said, \"God forgive me\r\nif I have to die.\" Sentences of death were pronounced, but these were\r\nsubsequently commuted to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, November 5th, 1879, an attempt was made to stick up the\r\nBank of Australasia at Moe in the Gippsland district of Victoria. At\r\nfirst it was supposed that the Kellys had paid a visit to this part of\r\nthe colony. The bank was a wooden building, situated about fifty yards\r\nfrom the Moe railway station, and nearly opposite the Selector's Arms\r\nHotel. The bank closed at the usual time and nothing occurred until\r\nabout nine o'clock p.m. At that time Mr. Hector Munro, the manager, was\r\nsitting in his parlour behind the bank chamber reading. He was alone\r\nin the house, his wife having gone up the main street to the grocer's\r\nshop. There was a knock at the door, and on Mr. Munro opening it, a\r\nman with a white cap over his head, with holes to look through cut in\r\nit, tried to force his way in. Munro endeavoured to slam the door to,\r\nbut the white cap individual had got his foot inside and managed to\r\npush his way in. \"Who are you? What do you want?\" cried Munro, but no\r\nanswer was returned. Munro still held the man and endeavoured to drag\r\nhim out of the house. The white cap drew a pistol, but Munro clutched\r\nhim by the arm, and in the struggle the pistol went off without doing\r\nany damage, except to the wall. Then another white-capped man appeared\r\nand struck Munro on the head. At the same time several people rushed\r\nover from the hotel to ascertain what the shooting was about, and the\r\ntwo would-be robbers bolted. Sergeant Irwin and two constables, with\r\nDr. Archibald Macdonald and several other civilians, followed the\r\nbushrangers. They picked up two felt hats and a serge mask in the yard,\r\nnot far from the back door of the bank. It was, however, too dark to do\r\nanything further that night, but at daylight the tracks were carefully\r\nfollowed, and shortly before six a.m. Constable Beck and Dr. Macdonald\r\nfound two men sitting on the Trafalgar railway platform. The doctor\r\ncovered them with his rifle while the constable handcuffed them. The\r\nmen said that the constable was making a great mistake, as they were\r\nunacquainted with each other, having arrived there by different routes.\r\nThey were waiting for the train from Melbourne to go further up country\r\nto look for work. Constable Beck replied, \"Oh, that's all right; I'll\r\nstand the racket. What's your names?\" As they hesitated, he continued,\r\n\"Now, no humbug; I know you. You don't live far away, and if you give\r\nfalse names you'll soon be bowled out.\" They then admitted that they\r\nwere brothers, and that their names were Robert and James Shanks. Their\r\nages were twenty-three and twenty-one years respectively. Two revolvers\r\nwere found in their carpet bags, and the white caps were picked up not\r\nfar from the platform. They were convicted of having attempted to rob\r\nthe bank, and assaulted the manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n  The Kelly Gang; Horse-stealing, a Great Industry of the District;\r\n  Faking the Brands; Assault on Constable Fitzpatrick; The Bush\r\n  Telegraphs; Murder of Sergeant Kennedy and Constables Scanlan and\r\n  Lonergan; Sticking up of the Faithfull Creek Station; Robbery of the\r\n  National Bank at Euroa; A Big Haul.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early years of Australian settlement bushranging was one of\r\nthe normal conditions in the colonies, and therefore attracted little\r\nnotice. Even the exploits of such heroes of the roads as Mike Howe,\r\nBrady, the Jewboy, and Jackey Jackey are very briefly related in the\r\nPress, and, with the exception of the first-named, about whom Mr. James\r\nBonwick has written a romance, very little has been heard of them\r\nsince the age in which they lived. In the next epoch the doings of the\r\nbushrangers were dwarfed in the public estimation by the sensational\r\nreports of the gold finds, and although in consequence of the growth\r\nof population and the great increase in the number of newspapers their\r\nactions received a wider publicity than those of their predecessors\r\nthe accounts of them are still meagre. The sensational inauguration of\r\nthe next era by the Gardiner gang--the sticking up and robbing of the\r\nGovernment Gold Escort--attracted wider notice to the bushrangers of\r\nthat epoch, and some notice of them appears even in the English Press.\r\nBut the notoriety of even the most celebrated of the bushrangers of\r\nthat epoch was nothing as compared with that of the Kelly gang, about\r\nwhom more columns of newspaper matter have been printed than of all\r\nthe bushrangers together in the earlier epochs. Several histories of\r\nthe Kelly gang have also been published, the best known, perhaps,\r\nbeing those of Mr. Superintendent Hare, who was for a time in charge\r\nof the police who were trying to capture the bushrangers, and Mr.\r\nJohn McWhirter, the reporter of the _Melbourne Age_, who accompanied\r\nthe police in their final and successful effort to suppress the gang.\r\nMr. McWhirter's \"History\" is largely compiled from the reports which\r\nhad appeared in the _Age_, and Mr. Hare is also largely indebted to\r\nthe same source. The Kellys have also inspired more than one drama,\r\nalthough the subject is not a favourite one with moralists, and the\r\nrepresentation of bushranging dramas has not met with favour from a\r\nlarge section of the community. In this connection we may note the\r\ninfluence of modern science. The stage of the performances of the\r\nearlier bushrangers was confined to their own locality. They were\r\nrarely heard of outside the colony in which they appeared. In the\r\nnext stage the telegraph carried news of their performances all over\r\nAustralia, and occasionally a stray newspaper paragraph was quoted\r\nin England. With the Kellys, however, it was different. Notices of\r\ntheir exploits were even sent across the ocean by cable, and the\r\nBritish public naturally desired to hear more of these daring robbers,\r\nand therefore extracts from the newspapers of Australia appeared\r\nmore frequently in the English Press than at any former epoch. The\r\nconsequence is that we can reconstruct the history of the Kellys\r\nmore easily than that of any other bushranging family. The father of\r\nNed Kelly was transported from Ireland. The maiden name of his wife\r\nwas Ellen Quinn. The eldest son, Ned, was born at Wallan Wallan in\r\n1854. Jim was born in 1856, and Dan in 1861. There were besides four\r\ndaughters--namely, Mrs. Gunn, Mrs. Skillian, and Kate and Grace Kelly.\r\nIn 1871, the second son, James, then about fifteen years of age, was\r\nsentenced to five years' imprisonment on two charges of horse-stealing.\r\nOn his discharge in 1876 he went to New South Wales and stuck up a\r\nnumber of people. He was captured almost immediately, and sent to gaol\r\nfor ten years. Edward, commonly known as Ned Kelly, was arrested in\r\n1870 and charged with having assisted Power in one of his numerous\r\nbushranging exploits, but was acquitted, as none of the witnesses could\r\nswear to his identity. It is said that on more than one occasion he\r\ntook care of Power's horses while that worthy was engaged in robbing.\r\nIn 1871 he was sent to gaol for three years for horse-stealing.\r\n\r\nHorse-stealing appears to have been the principal industry of the\r\ndistrict, as cattle-duffing had been of the Wedden Mountain district,\r\nand of Manaro, and the Kellys, the Harts, the Byrnes, and others in\r\nthis district, were quite as adept in \"faking\" brands as the Lowrys,\r\nthe O'Meallys, or the Clarkes had been. But science had made advances\r\neven in these mountains since the era of the Gardiner gang. In earlier\r\ntimes the brands of horses and cattle were \"faked\"--_i.e._, altered\r\nso as to represent something different from what they were intended\r\nto do--by branding over them and adding to them. There were some\r\nexpert blacksmiths among the cattle-duffers, and these would make a\r\nbrand to fit over an old brand and completely change its character.\r\nFor instance, a simple A brand might have a circle burned round it\r\nthus--(A), or it might have another letter conjoined to it thus--A-B.\r\nThe manner in which brands might be \"faked\" was endless, and when it\r\nwas impossible to \"fake\" a brand it was \"blotched,\" or burned over, so\r\nthat the original design could not be recognised. The Kellys and their\r\ncompanions in the Warby and Strathbogie ranges, however, did not go\r\nto the trouble of making special brands to \"fake\" other brands. They\r\nobtained the same results by the use of iodine, which burned such marks\r\ninto the skins of the stolen animals as were desired. The plan adopted\r\nwas to make raids into distant parts, collect a mob of horses, drive\r\nthem into an inaccessible ravine in the mountains, \"fake\" their brands\r\nand keep them until the sores had healed and the brands looked old.\r\nThen the animals, having got fat in the meantime, were driven to market\r\nand sold without fear of detection. Horses stolen in the north--some\r\neven from across the New South Wales border--were driven south to\r\nMelbourne, Ballarat, Geelong, or some other large town, and sold openly\r\nin the public sale yards; while those stolen in the south were driven\r\nto some northern market, sometimes being taken as far as Sydney.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, Daniel, the youngest of the Kelly boys, was sent to gaol for\r\nthree months for having taken part in a house-breaking robbery in\r\nconjunction with the Lloyds, who were connected by marriage with the\r\nKellys. In the following year, 1887, warrants were issued for his\r\narrest on six charges of horse-stealing, but he could not be found.\r\nOn April 15th, 1878, Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick, having learned\r\nthat Dan Kelly was at home, went to the Kellys' hut at Greta, to\r\narrest him. \"This hut,\" said the _Benalla Standard_, \"was a well-known\r\ntrysting-place for the bushranger Power.\" The constable rode up, and\r\nseeing Dan standing at the door said to him, \"You're my prisoner.\"\r\n\"All right,\" replied Dan nonchalantly. The constable dismounted and\r\nhitched his horse to a sapling, when Dan said that he had been riding\r\nall day and had had nothing to eat. After some conversation the\r\nconstable agreed to wait while Dan had some food, before taking him to\r\nBenalla, and Dan went in and sat down. As he did so Mrs. Kelly said\r\nto Fitzpatrick, \"You won't take Dan out o' this to-night.\" \"Shut up,\r\nmother,\" exclaimed Dan, \"it's all right.\" The old woman continued to\r\ngrumble in an undertone, while she placed bread and meat and tea on the\r\ntable. Presently she asked the constable, \"Have you got a warrant?\"\r\n\"I've got a telegram, and that's as good,\" replied Fitzpatrick. The\r\nconstable was standing at the door, and Dan, who took his arrest\r\ncoolly, as if it was a mere matter of course, told his mother not\r\nto make a row about it, as it did not matter, and then invited the\r\nconstable to take some food. Fitzpatrick accepted the invitation, and\r\nwent in. As he seated himself Mrs. Kelly remarked, \"If my son Ned was\r\nhere, he'd throw you out of the window.\" Dan was looking out of the\r\nwindow at the time, and he exclaimed \"Here he is.\" Fitzpatrick very\r\nnaturally turned to look, and Dan pounced on to him. Mrs. Kelly seized\r\na heavy garden spade which had been used as a fire shovel and was much\r\ndamaged, and struck Fitzpatrick a furious blow on the head, making a\r\ndint in his helmet. Fitzpatrick fell down, and several people hearing\r\nthe noise rushed in. Among them were Ned Kelly, William Skillian\r\n(husband of one of the Kelly girls), and William Williams, alias\r\nBricky. Ned Kelly held a revolver in his hand which was still smoking,\r\nand Fitzpatrick was wounded in the arm. Ned said, \"I'm sorry I fired.\r\nYou're the civilest---- trap I've seen.\" He offered to cut the bullet\r\nout and bind up the wound, but Fitzpatrick refused to let him touch\r\nit. Then Ned said that the constable could not be allowed to go away\r\nuntil the bullet was cut out and he had promised not to tell how he got\r\nwounded. \"You can say your pistol went off by accident,\" he said. \"Tell\r\nhim if he does tell he won't live long after,\" cried Mrs. Kelly. The\r\nold woman was again told to \"shut up.\" Fitzpatrick, knowing the men he\r\nhad to deal with, promised not to say who had wounded him, and took his\r\nknife from his pocket. He cut a small gash, over where the bullet was,\r\nand squeezed it out. Then he twisted his handkerchief round the wound\r\nand said it was \"all right.\" Ned Kelly picked up the bullet and put\r\nit away on a shelf, and a few minutes later the constable was allowed\r\nto mount his horse and go. On the following day a party of troopers\r\nwent to the Eleven Mile Creek and arrested Mrs. Ellen Kelly, William\r\nSkillian, and William Williams. A search was made for Ned and Dan\r\nKelly, but they could not be found. Skillian and Williams, when brought\r\nup for trial for their share in this assault, declared that they only\r\ncame in after the shot was fired, and had taken no part whatever in the\r\nscrimmage. They were, however, sentenced to six years' imprisonment,\r\nwhile Mrs. Kelly was sent to gaol for three years.\r\n\r\nIt was generally understood that Ned and Dan Kelly were in hiding\r\nsomewhere in the neighbourhood, and some twenty-five troopers with\r\nblack trackers were told off to search for them. Fourteen men,\r\nresidents in the neighbourhood, were arrested under the Outlawry\r\nAct, on suspicion that they had harboured or aided and abetted the\r\nbushrangers, and were remanded from week to week for some three months,\r\nwhile the police were seeking for evidence against them. Mr. Zincke,\r\nwho appeared at the police court on behalf of the prisoners, protested\r\nagainst this arbitrary act of the police, and urged that it was illegal\r\nto detain as prisoners persons against whom no specific charge had been\r\nmade. \"If the Kellys were caught,\" he said, \"these men would be told\r\nto go about their business.\" He stated his belief that the Outlawry\r\nAct would not warrant these proceedings and that the law was being\r\nstrained in a dangerous manner. The magistrates on the bench generally\r\nlistened to his pleadings with exemplary patience and then granted the\r\nremand asked for by the police. There can be very little doubt that\r\nMr. Zincke was perfectly justified in saying that these proceedings\r\nwere illegal, but the magistrates of Beechworth and other parts of\r\nthe disturbed district had learned by experience that, as long as the\r\nsympathisers and \"bush telegraphs\" were at liberty, the police had very\r\nlittle chance of capturing the bushrangers, and so, during the whole\r\ntime that the Kelly gang was in existence, a number of people were kept\r\nlocked up because they were suspected of giving food or assistance to\r\nthe outlaws and, more important than all, of giving the bushrangers\r\ninformation as to the movements of the police. The number of persons\r\nthus held under restraint varied from month to month. Sometimes a few\r\nwere discharged while others took their places. The largest number in\r\nthe police cells at any one time was thirty-five. But the authorities\r\nafter all acted in a half-hearted and inefficient manner. They arrested\r\nonly men and boys, while the women and girls were left free to assist\r\nthe bushrangers as they pleased, and the women were quite as active\r\nand quite as efficient in affording assistance and information to the\r\nbushrangers as the men could have possibly been.\r\n\r\nOn October 26th one of the parties of police in search of the outlaws\r\nwent into camp at Stringy Bark Creek, about eight miles on the King\r\nRiver side of the Wombat Range. Sergeant Kennedy was supposed to\r\nhave received information from a friend of the Kellys as to their\r\nwhereabouts, and thus to have penetrated nearly to their hiding place.\r\nThe friend who had informed the police, however, also told the Kellys\r\nof their approach. The country is densely covered with stringy bark\r\ntrees and scrub, and is almost impenetrable. Sergeant Kennedy and\r\nConstable Scanlan had gone into the scrub to endeavour to ascertain the\r\nwhereabouts of the two Kellys, while Constables Lonergan and McIntyre\r\nwere left in charge of the camp. Lonergan was employed in making tea\r\nready for the two who were away, when four men on horseback came up and\r\ncried \"Bail up! put up your hands.\" Lonergan made a jump to get behind\r\na tree, putting his hand to his belt for a pistol at the same time, and\r\nwas shot. He cried out \"O Christ, I'm shot,\" and fell dead. Constable\r\nMcIntyre was sitting down. He jumped up, but having no weapon upon\r\nhim at the time he surrendered. Ned Kelly walked to Lonergan's body\r\nand examined it. Then he rose, and said, \"What a pity! Why didn't\r\nthe---- fool surrender?\" He afterwards said that it was all Constable\r\nFitzpatrick's fault. \"He'd no right to lag my mother and brother-in-law\r\nfor nothing.\" Ned Kelly ordered Constable McIntyre to sit down as if\r\nnothing had happened, and warned him that he would be shot at once\r\nif he \"gave the office\" to the sergeant. The bushrangers then hid\r\nthemselves behind the trees. Sergeant Kennedy and Constable Scanlan\r\nrode up some time later, unconscious that anything had happened. When\r\nthey came close McIntyre said, \"Sergeant, we're surrounded. You'd\r\nbetter surrender.\" Scanlan laughed, and put his hand to his belt, when\r\nNed Kelly fired at him and missed. Scanlan jumped off his horse and\r\nmade for a gum tree, but was shot dead before he reached it. Kennedy\r\nwheeled his horse round and started at a gallop, but had gone only a\r\nfew yards when he was brought down with a rifle bullet. His horse,\r\nfrightened at the noise and the fall of its rider, dashed through the\r\ncamp, and as it passed Constable McIntyre threw himself across its\r\nback. He got into the saddle, and urged it forward, when it was brought\r\ndown, shot by a rifle bullet through the heart. McIntyre fell clear,\r\nand crawled into a patch of scrub. He found a wombat hole near at hand.\r\nHe crept into it, and lay there, while he could hear the bushrangers\r\nwalking round searching for him in the scrub, and swearing that they\r\nwould \"do for\" him when they caught him. When it was quite dark he\r\ncrawled out of his hole and walked twenty miles to Mansfield to inform\r\nthe police of what had taken place.\r\n\r\nInspector Pewtress, with a party of police, started from Melbourne\r\non Sunday, the 27th, in a special train, and soon reached the camp\r\nin the ranges. The bodies of Lonergan and Scanlan were lying as they\r\nhad fallen not far from where the fire had been lighted, but that of\r\nSergeant Kennedy could not be seen from the camp. It was not found\r\nuntil the 31st, owing to the density of the scrub around the little\r\ncleared patch, where the camp had been pitched. Three bullet wounds\r\nwere found in it, and a cloak had been thrown over the face to protect\r\nit from dingoes or the weather. It was said that Ned Kelly had ridden\r\nto his camp to fetch the cloak to cover Kennedy with, because he\r\nconsidered him to be the bravest man he had ever met.\r\n\r\nRewards of £100 each had been offered by the Victorian Government for\r\nthe capture of Ned and Dan Kelly. Now the rewards were increased to\r\n£500, while similar rewards were offered for Steve Hart (twenty years\r\nof age) and Joe Byrnes (nineteen years of age).\r\n\r\nIt was reported that on October 31st the Kellys had stuck up and robbed\r\nNeil Christian and other persons at Bungowanah, near Baumgarten's, on\r\nthe Murray River, but as the whole of that country was under water, in\r\nconsequence of a flood in the river at that time, this was discredited.\r\nThe police asserted that the Kellys were somewhere in the mountains,\r\nbut they searched the \"Rat's Castle\" and other hiding places without\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th December a rough-looking bushman called at Younghusband's\r\nstation, on Faithfull's Creek, and asked if the manager, Mr. Macaulay,\r\nwas about? An old man named Fitzgerald, employed on the station,\r\nreplied that the manager was away and would not return till morning. He\r\nasked the man if he could do anything for him? The traveller replied\r\n\"No, it's of no consequence.\" He walked to the house and said to Mrs.\r\nFitzgerald, \"I'm Ned Kelly. You needn't be frightened, we only want\r\nfood for ourselves and our horses.\" Seeing the man talking to his wife,\r\nFitzgerald went to them, and Mrs. Fitzgerald said to him \"This is Mr.\r\nKelly. He wants some refreshments.\" By this time Ned had his revolver\r\nin his hand. Fitzgerald grasped the situation and replied \"Well, if\r\nthe gentleman wants refreshments he'll have to have them.\" Ned gave\r\na whistle and the other three bushrangers came forward and Dan took\r\ntheir horses to the stables. Joe Byrnes took care of the Fitzgeralds,\r\nwhile Ned and Steve Hart went round and collected all the men at work\r\non the station and locked them up in the store room. Shortly afterwards\r\na man named Gloster, who had a store in Seymour and who frequently\r\ntravelled round with a spring cart loaded with goods for sale at the\r\nfarms and stations, came to the station for a bucket of water to make\r\ntea with, and Ned ordered him to bail up. Knowing that Gloster was of a\r\ndetermined character Fitzgerald shouted to him to advise him to \"give\r\nin.\" \"What for?\" asked Gloster. \"I'm Ned Kelly,\" exclaimed that hero.\r\n\"I don't care a---- who you are,\" returned Gloster. At this moment Dan\r\nKelly came up and threatened to shoot Gloster, but Ned forbade him, and\r\nFitzgerald persuaded Gloster that resistance was useless and prevailed\r\non him to surrender.\r\n\r\nWhen Macaulay, the manager, came home he was also bailed up. \"What's\r\nthe good of your sticking up the station?\" he asked, \"you've better\r\nhorses than we have and anything else you require you can have without\r\nall this nonsense.\" Ned said he had a purpose. After some conversation,\r\nduring which Macaulay said he had no intention of interfering with\r\nthem, Macaulay was permitted to remain free, but was closely watched to\r\nprevent him from sending for the police. The bushrangers then searched\r\nGloster's cart, selected suits of clothes for themselves, and made very\r\nfree with the bottles of scent and other small articles.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the 11th December, 1878, Messrs. McDougal,\r\nDudley, and Casement, in a spring cart, were about to pass through the\r\ngate over the level crossing of the railway, close to the station. Mr.\r\nJennant, who was riding, dismounted to open the gate for the cart to\r\npass through, when Ned Kelly, on horseback, cried \"Surrender, or you\r\nwill be shot.\" Another bushranger, Joe Byrnes, walked down quickly\r\nfrom the station to assist his mate if necessary. Mr. McDougal, taking\r\nthem for troopers as they carried handcuffs in their hands, asked what\r\nright they had to arrest them in this manner, when Ned replied, \"Shut\r\nup. I'll shoot you if you give me any cheek.\" \"You wouldn't shoot an\r\nold man unarmed,\" exclaimed McDougal. \"Not if you surrender quietly,\"\r\nreplied Ned. They said they surrendered, and Byrnes opened the gate and\r\ntold them to drive to the homestead. As they came up a station hand who\r\nwas standing at the store door said, \"Gentlemen, allow me to introduce\r\nyou to Mr. Edward Kelly.\" McDougal and his companions were not much\r\nsurprised, as they had already begun to perceive that their captors\r\nwere not troopers in plain clothes, as they had at first thought. The\r\nprisoners were taken into the store, the bushrangers telling them that\r\nthe horses would be looked after.\r\n\r\nThe store-room was a long wooden building situated about twenty\r\nyards from the house. It had only one door and one window, both near\r\ntogether, so that it could easily be guarded. With so many men confined\r\nin it the air soon became foul, and the prisoners were allowed to come\r\nout in small batches to obtain some fresh air. Only the men were locked\r\nup, the women being left free and were not molested in any way.\r\n\r\nAt about three o'clock Ned Kelly asked Mr. Macaulay for a small cheque.\r\nMr. Macaulay gave it to him. It was for £3. Joe Byrnes was left in\r\ncharge of the station, while the others started away, Ned in Gloster's\r\ncart, Dan in McDougal's, and Hart on horseback. At about half-past\r\nfour there was a knock at the door of the National Bank at Euroa,\r\nand when it was opened a man requested that a cheque might be cashed\r\nfor him. The manager, Mr. Robert Scott, said it was after hours, and\r\nhe could not open the bank again till morning. The man said it would\r\ninconvenience him greatly to have to call again, as he did not live in\r\nthe town. He begged so hard that at length the manager consented to\r\ngive him the money to oblige him. The manager opened the bank door,\r\nand as soon as they were inside the man said, \"Put up your hands. I'm\r\nNed Kelly.\" Taken by surprise, the manager was compelled to obey. The\r\nmanager was forced to open the safe door and to hand over £1942 0s. 6d.\r\nin notes, gold, and silver, thirty-one ounces of smelted gold, five\r\nbags of cartridges, and two revolvers. There had been rumours that\r\nthe Kellys intended to stick up a bank, and arms and ammunition had\r\nbeen sent from the head offices in Melbourne to most of the country\r\nbranches. The National Bank at Euroa had been thus furnished, but in\r\nconsequence of the cunning of the bushrangers the arms were useless.\r\nMr. Scott had a loaded revolver on his table when Ned Kelly asked him\r\nto cash the cheque, but he was so unsuspicious of the character of his\r\ncustomer that he left it there when he went into the bank chamber.\r\nHaving obtained all the money he could get Kelly turned to enter the\r\nprivate apartments, when Scott said, \"If you go in there I'll strike\r\nyou whatever the consequences may be.\" Steve Hart put his revolver to\r\nScott's face and said \"Keep back.\" Kelly laughed, and walked through\r\nthe door. He went along the passage, and looked out of the back door\r\ninto the yard. Then he returned and told Scott to go and put his\r\nhorse into the buggy. \"That's the work of the groom,\" said Scott,\r\n\"but he happens to be away just now.\" \"I'll do it myself,\" returned\r\nNed, and went into the yard. When the horse was harnessed, Kelly said\r\nhe was going to take the family out for a drive. He made Scott get\r\ninto Gloster's cart, and Mrs. Scott and the child into the buggy. Dan\r\nKelly and Hart came on behind. When they had gone out of the little\r\nstreet Scott asked Ned where they were going. \"To Younghusband's,\" was\r\nthe reply. \"I'll drive,\" said Scott, \"I know the road.\" \"All right,\"\r\nreplied Ned, handing him the reins. \"But if you try any pranks, look\r\nout.\" Ned Kelly treated Mrs. Scott with great politeness, so that she\r\nsaid that she could never believe he was the bloodthirsty villain he\r\nhad been represented to be.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph wires had been cut on each side of the station soon after\r\ntheir arrival, and while the main body of the robbers was gone to Euroa\r\na train stopped close to the station to set down a line repairer named\r\nWatts. As the railway station was some distance away it was thought\r\nthat the train had brought the police, and Byrnes prepared to defend\r\nhimself. He shut all the men in the store, and charged them to keep\r\nquiet. When Watts came to the station to enquire how the break in the\r\nline had occurred and to obtain assistance Byrnes bailed him up, and\r\ntold him that he could repair the line later on. Nothing of importance\r\noccurred after this until the return of Ned and his mates with the bank\r\nmanager and the money.\r\n\r\nDuring their drive together Ned Kelly told Scott that he was---- sorry\r\nthat Sergeant Kennedy had been shot. He was a brave man. \"But,\" he\r\nadded, \"I couldn't help it. The police ought to surrender when they are\r\ncalled on.\" He showed Scott the presentation gold watch which had once\r\nbelonged to Kennedy and which he had taken from the body \"to remember\r\nhim by.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after their return to the station they all had tea, Ned Kelly\r\ntelling his prisoners that he would not detain them much longer. The\r\nmeal was barely over when a train drew up opposite the station and\r\nwhistled. Ned Kelly shouted \"Hullo boys, here's a special with the----\r\nbobbies. We'll fight 'em. We're ready for 'em, however many there may\r\nbe.\" The driver waited for a few minutes and then the train went out.\r\nIt was soon ascertained that Watts, the line repairer, had arranged for\r\nthe train to pick him up after he had had time to repair the break, but\r\nowing to his being shut up in the station store he had neither repaired\r\nthe line nor been able to inform the engine driver of the reason of his\r\nnon-success. At about half-past seven, the prisoners were mustered and\r\ntold to remain in the store for three hours. Scott took out his watch\r\nand asked \"Eleven?\" \"No,\" replied Ned, \"half-past. If any one leaves\r\nbefore, I'll hear of it and make it---- hot for him. I'll track him\r\ndown and shoot him dead. You can't escape me.\" Byrnes turned to Scott\r\nand said \"That looks like a---- good watch. Let's see it.\" Scott handed\r\nhim the watch and the robber put it in his pocket. This was a signal\r\nto the other bushrangers. One took Macaulay's watch, and another asked\r\nMcDougal for his. McDougal took it from his pocket and said \"I should\r\nbe sorry to lose it. It is a keepsake from my dead mother.\" \"Is it,\"\r\nsaid Kelly, \"then we'll not take it.\" Ned Kelly warned Macaulay that he\r\nheld him responsible for the men. \"If you let them go before the time,\"\r\nhe said, \"I'll shoot you like a---- dingo the first time I see you.\"\r\nShortly afterwards the bushrangers mounted their horses, which had been\r\nfeeding in the stables during the time the station was held, and rode\r\naway. The men were released from the store but were kept at the station\r\nfor about three hours. Mr. and Mrs. Scott returned to Euroa in their\r\nbuggy and telegraphed the news of the robbery as soon as possible,\r\nwhich was not before the next morning. Gloster rode off to inform the\r\npolice at the nearest town, and the information as to this daring\r\noutrage was spread about by others who had been robbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n  The Kellys Stick up the Town of Jerilderie; Robbery of the Bank of\r\n  New South Wales; A Symposium in the Royal Hotel; A Three-days' Spree;\r\n  \"Hurrah for the Good Old Times of Morgan and Ben Hall\"; the Robbers\r\n  Take a Rest for a Year; The Kelly Sympathisers Again; The Kellys\r\n  Reappear; Murder of Aaron Sherritt.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the bank robbery the \"gentlemen of the Strathbogie Ranges\"\r\nagain retired to their mountain fastnesses. Occasionally a paragraph\r\nin one of the local newspapers recorded the movements of the police\r\nor furnished a story about the black trackers, but these notices\r\nwere necessarily very meagre, as the police declined to furnish any\r\ninformation as to their proceedings or intentions, because this would\r\nbe of more use to the bushrangers than to any one else. For more than a\r\nmonth nothing reliable had been heard of them. Even the reports of the\r\narrest and detention of numbers of \"bush telegraphs\" failed to attract\r\nany attention, and the Kelly gang had almost ceased to be spoken\r\nof, when suddenly the whole country was roused by the news that the\r\nbushrangers had stuck up the town of Jerilderie, in New South Wales.\r\nJerilderie is situated on the Yanko Creek, not far from its junction\r\nwith the Billabong, and at that time contained about 300 inhabitants,\r\na bank, four public-houses, a post and telegraph office, and several\r\nchurches, schools, and other buildings. The local police station\r\nand lock-up was near the outside of the town, and there were two\r\nofficers--Constables Devine and Richards--stationed there. At midnight\r\nof February 8th, 1879, a man roused Constable Devine from his bed, and\r\ninformed him that a row had taken place at Davidson's Hotel and a man\r\nhad been killed. He exhorted the constable to \"come quick.\" Constable\r\nDevine woke Constable Richards and both dressed as hastily as possible.\r\nWhen they came out they were confronted by Ned Kelly, revolver in\r\nhand, and ordered to \"bail up.\" Not having their arms on them, and\r\nbeing taken completely by surprise, the two constables surrendered at\r\nonce and were locked up in the cells. The bushrangers then compelled\r\nMrs. Devine, who had also partially dressed, to hand over all arms\r\nand ammunition, and took possession of the lock-up, remaining quietly\r\nthere till morning, their horses being placed in the police stables\r\nat the rear. It was Sunday morning, and as the Catholic church had\r\nnot yet been finished, the court-house had been rented for religious\r\npurposes, and Mrs. Devine had been accustomed to clean up the place,\r\nset the temporary altar, and place the forms and chairs ready for mass.\r\nThe bushrangers told her to perform her task as usual, after having\r\nextorted a promise from her that she would not mention their presence\r\nto any one, and to make certain of her keeping her word one of them,\r\ndressed as a constable, went with her to the court-house and stayed\r\nwhile she swept the floor and prepared the room. Then they returned to\r\nthe lock-up, which was about one hundred yards from the court-house,\r\nand remained there all day, the bushrangers, arrayed in the constables'\r\nuniforms, sitting quietly in the guard-room. No doubt numbers of people\r\npassed and saw them, but no one had any suspicion that the bushrangers\r\nwere in charge instead of the police.\r\n\r\nEarly on Monday morning Byrnes took two horses to the blacksmith's\r\nshop to be shod, and the blacksmith, feeling some doubt as to the\r\n_bonâ-fides_ of the pseudo trooper, made a note of the brands on the\r\nhorses. At about ten a.m. Ned and Dan Kelly, accompanied by Constable\r\nRichards, went to the Royal Hotel, the largest hotel in the town, where\r\nRichards formally introduced them to the proprietor, Mr. Cox. Ned\r\ninformed Mr. Cox that he required the use of some rooms, as the gang\r\nintended sticking up the bank. He selected a large and a small room\r\non the ground floor, near the bar, and conducted the few men about at\r\nthe time into the large room, where they were ordered to remain until\r\ngiven permission to depart. Dan Kelly was placed on guard at the door\r\nto keep order and prevent anybody from escaping, and was instructed\r\nto shoot the first man who refused to do as he was told. On Mr. Cox\r\npassing his word, as a gentleman, not to mention their presence to any\r\none who should come in, he was permitted to take charge of the bar as\r\nusual, and was given to understand that he would be held responsible\r\nfor the discretion of the women and servants. Any one of them whom he\r\ncould not trust was to be sent into the large room. The preliminaries\r\nwere arranged so unostentatiously and quietly, that no rumour of the\r\npresence of the bushrangers had yet been heard, and as customers\r\ndropped into the hotel they were taken into the big room, and told to\r\nremain on penalty of death.\r\n\r\nHaving made these arrangements, Ned Kelly walked into the hotel yard\r\nto reconnoitre. There was a detached kitchen here, and the rear of the\r\nbank of New South Wales was only a few yards from the rear of this\r\nkitchen. The bank faced on another street, and there was no dividing\r\nfence between the yard at the back of the bank and the hotel yard. Hart\r\nwas placed on watch near the kitchen, while Byrnes entered the back\r\ndoor of the bank. Mr. Living, the teller, was in the bank chamber. He\r\nwas not surprised to hear a man enter by the back door, as Mr. Cox\r\nand other customers frequently came in that way, it being a short cut\r\nfrom the hotel. Suddenly, however, Byrnes came to the counter, pointed\r\na revolver at Living's head, and cried out, \"I'm Kelly, keep quiet.\"\r\nLiving held his hands above his head. \"Where's your pistols?\" asked\r\nByrnes. \"I've got none,\" replied Living. Byrnes then ordered Living\r\nand the accountant Mackie to \"Come over to the hotel.\" They came from\r\nbehind the counter and did as they were told, Byrnes following them.\r\nWhen they reached the door of the large room Dan Kelly inquired,\r\n\"Where's Tarleton?\" \"In his room,\" replied Living. \"Then go and fetch\r\nhim and no---- nonsense,\" said Dan. Living went back to the bank,\r\nbut being unable to find the manager in his rooms began to fear that\r\nsomething might have happened to him. He was about to return to the\r\nhotel to inform the Kellys that he could not find the manager, when he\r\nheard a splashing. He went to the bathroom and knocked. Tarleton had\r\nbeen for a forty-mile ride that morning, and had just returned and\r\nwas having a wash. When he opened the door and was informed that the\r\ntown was in possession of the Kelly gang, and the bank was stuck up,\r\nhe laughed heartily, believing it to be a huge joke. Living assured\r\nhim that it was not a laughing matter, but he was still incredulous.\r\nHowever, he dressed and went to the hotel, where he soon discovered\r\nthat what he had deemed impossible had come to pass. The three bank\r\nofficials were placed in the large room. Tarleton, who took a seat next\r\nto Constable Richards, whispered, \"I can knock Hart down, shall I?\"\r\n\"What's the good?\" replied the constable, \"Dan Kelly's there, and he'd\r\nshoot you down at once.\"\r\n\r\nNed Kelly had hitherto been walking round as a sort of\r\ninspector-general of the proceedings and giving orders. He now entered\r\nthe room and ordered drinks to be served all round. Then he made a\r\nspeech in which he blamed Constable Fitzpatrick for all that had\r\noccurred. \"I wasn't within a hundred miles of Greta when he was shot,\"\r\nsaid Ned, \"and up to then I'd never killed a man in my life.\" He\r\nwent on to say that he had stolen two hundred and eighty horses from\r\nWhitby's station, and had sold them at Baumgarten's. He took out a\r\nrevolver and exclaimed: \"This was Lonergan's! I took it from him. The\r\ngun I shot him with was a crooked, worn-out thing, not worth picking\r\nup. I shot him because he threatened my mother and my sister if they\r\nrefused to tell where Ned Kelly was. The police are worse than the----\r\nblack trackers. I came here to shoot Devine and Richards, and I'm\r\ngoing to do it.\" The men at the table began to intercede for Richards,\r\nwho was sitting quietly among them and who did not speak, but Kelly\r\nexclaimed dramatically, \"He must die.\"\r\n\r\nNed got the key of the bank safe and took £1450 worth of notes and\r\nmoney from it. He also took £691 from the teller's drawers. While thus\r\nemployed, Messrs. Gill, Hardie, and Rankin came in on business in the\r\nordinary course and were ordered to bail up. They turned and ran. Ned\r\nKelly followed and caught Rankin, but the others got away. Ned was\r\nfurious at this escape. He said that news of their presence would be\r\nall over the place in a few minutes, and he swore he would shoot Rankin\r\nin revenge. He took Rankin to the hotel, stood him up against the wall\r\nin the passage and flourished his revolver about. The men in the room\r\npleaded that Rankin might be spared, and urged that he could not have\r\nprevented Gill and Hardie from running away. While this was going on\r\nByrnes came in with Mr. Hardie and said that they could not find Gill,\r\nthe proprietor of the local newspaper, as he had not returned to his\r\noffice. Ned Kelly then let Rankin go and declared that he would burn\r\nthe newspaper office. Mr. Gill it is said went out of the town and hid\r\nin a clump of trees by the side of the river till evening. Ned then\r\nwalked down to McDougall's Hotel and shouted for about thirty men who\r\nwere in or about the hotel at the time. On his return to the Royal\r\nHotel he was informed that Hart had robbed the Rev. Mr. Gribble of a\r\ngold watch. He called Hart up and asked indignantly, \"What right has a\r\nthing like you to rob a clergyman?\" He swore a good deal and compelled\r\nHart to give the watch back. Complaints were made that he had stolen a\r\nnew saddle and bridle from a saddler's shop, and some other articles\r\nfrom other places. Ned called him a ---- thief, and ordered him to\r\nreturn everything he had taken.\r\n\r\nNed Kelly paid more than one visit to the Post and Telegraph Office\r\nto \"see how things were going on.\" The robbers had cut the wires on\r\neither side of the town before their entry and had chopped down seven\r\ntelegraph posts in the main street near the office. They had given\r\norders to Mr. Jefferson, the telegraph master, that no repairs should\r\nbe attempted until permission was given, and Ned took care that these\r\norders were obeyed. The robbers held the town for three days, in\r\nimitation of the manner in which the Hall and Gilbert gang had held\r\nCanowindra. Jerilderie was at this time slightly larger than Canowindra\r\nat the time when it had been stuck up and held, but there was less\r\ntraffic through it, and consequently less connection between it and the\r\nouter world than with Canowindra. The road running through Jerilderie\r\nleads from Conargo to Narrandera. Jerilderie is about thirty miles\r\nfrom Conargo and sixty-five from Narrandera. All round are huge sheep\r\nand cattle stations, with only a few men employed on them except at\r\nshearing or mustering time. All through the remainder of the year the\r\ntraffic is inconsiderable. There was in Jerilderie, however, a large\r\nwool-washing and fellmongery establishment which employed a fair number\r\nof workmen. Canowindra, on the other hand, was a wayside town on the\r\nmain road from Bathurst to Forbes, the traffic being considerable all\r\nthe year round. There were also several small diggings settlements\r\nnot far away, and the residents of these frequently came to purchase\r\narticles from the stores at Canowindra. It was far easier, therefore,\r\nto isolate Jerilderie for three days than it had been Canowindra in\r\nthe earlier days of bushranging. The Hall and Gilbert gang also robbed\r\neverybody except the landlord of the hotel they took possession of.\r\nThe Kellys, on the other hand, robbed no one outside of the bank.\r\nJerilderie also was a much more compact town than Canowindra, the\r\nlatter consisting of one long straggling street, with only a few houses\r\noutside this line, while Jerilderie had several cross streets, and at\r\nleast two parallel with the river.\r\n\r\nThe robbers held the town from midnight on Saturday, until about four\r\np.m. on the Wednesday following. Shortly before the men were allowed to\r\nleave the Royal Hotel, Ned Kelly gave Living a paper which he said gave\r\na history of his life, and the truth about what he had done. Living\r\npromised that he would do his best to get it published, and handed it\r\nto Mr. Gill, who read it and forwarded it to the Government. It was a\r\nlong rambling statement, in some parts quite incoherent, and much of it\r\nfalse. It was never published. At about four o'clock Byrnes left the\r\ntown in the direction of the Murray River. He was riding his own horse,\r\nand had the money stolen from the bank packed on one of the police\r\nhorses, which he was leading. A minute or two later Dan Kelly and Steve\r\nHart mounted their horses, and galloped several times up and down the\r\nmain street, flourishing their revolvers and shouting, \"Hurrah for the\r\ngood old times of Morgan and Ben Hall.\" Then they left the town along\r\nthe main road. Ned Kelly, mounted on his gray mare and leading a second\r\npolice horse, left some minutes later. Before going, he rode from the\r\npolice station to the Royal Hotel, and told the men detained in the\r\nlarge room there that they were free.\r\n\r\nThe bushrangers had left the town by different routes, probably to\r\nprevent any information as to the road they had travelled from being\r\nfurnished to the police, but no doubt they had arranged where they\r\nshould meet outside at a safe distance. Late in the evening they rode\r\nup to Wannamurra station, about twenty-five miles from Jerilderie, when\r\nNed Kelly asked Mr. A. Mackie whether his brother was at home yet? Mr.\r\nMackie replied that he did not know. \"I'm going to shoot him for giving\r\nhorses to Living and Tarleton to ride to Deniliquin for the traps,\"\r\nsaid Ned. They all went to the station together, but evidence was soon\r\nbrought forward to prove that the bank employés had not obtained horses\r\nfrom Mr. Mackie, and at length Ned exonerated that gentleman for what\r\nhe called \"his treachery,\" but forcibly expressed his intention of\r\nshooting Living. \"I gave him back his life policy,\" he said, \"and I\r\nonly burned two or three of the bank books instead of the lot to oblige\r\nhim. He asked for them, and I treated him as fair as I could, and now\r\nhe takes advantage of my kindness to betray me.\" He walked up and down\r\non the verandah of the house for several minutes swearing at Living,\r\nand more than once said he had a good mind to go back and \"settle him\"\r\nat once. His rage, however, soon subsided, and the gang proceeded on\r\ntheir way, no attempt being made to detain them.\r\n\r\nJerilderie lies about one hundred and fifty miles, as the crow flies,\r\nfrom where the bushrangers were supposed to have been hidden, in\r\nthe Strathbogie Mountains, and when the news of the bank robbery\r\nat Jerilderie was telegraphed all over the country, wonder was\r\neverywhere expressed as to how the robbers had crossed this country,\r\nsome of it thickly populated, without being perceived. The skill with\r\nwhich the robbery had been planned, the boldness and completeness\r\nof the arrangements, and the apparent ease with which it had been\r\naccomplished, made the Kelly gang the principal topic of conversation.\r\nThe New South Wales Government issued a proclamation declaring Ned and\r\nDan Kelly, Joe Byrnes, and Steve Hart outlaws, and offered a reward of\r\n£3000 for their capture, dead or alive. The associated banks of the\r\ncolony supplemented this reward by another of £1000. The Victorian\r\nGovernment increased the rewards already offered to the same amount\r\nas was offered by the New South Wales Government, while the banks in\r\nthat colony added another £1000; thus making the total reward offered\r\nfor the capture of the four members of the gang £8000. Two thousand\r\npounds per man was the highest reward ever offered for the capture of\r\nbushrangers in Australia.\r\n\r\nFor some time the police of New South Wales scoured the country round\r\nJerilderie and the plains between that town and the Victorian border,\r\nwhile the Victorian police were quite as active on their side of the\r\nMurray River, until at length it was definitely ascertained that the\r\nbushrangers were safe back in their mountain fastnesses. The paragraphs\r\npublished from time to time in the Beechworth, the Benalla, and the\r\nWangaratta papers, and in local papers even further removed from the\r\nhome of the Kellys, tend to show that although the black boys failed to\r\nfollow a trail in the mountains with the certainty and skill displayed\r\nby them in leveller country, they still kept the outlaws in a continual\r\nstate of fear of capture. Ned Kelly is reported to have called them\r\n\"those six little black devils,\" and to have sworn to shoot them if\r\never he \"got the chance.\" \"Those---- trackers,\" he cried, \"I'd like\r\nto shoot 'em. They're no ---- good in this country. They can't track\r\nin Victoria. I can track as well as they can out on the plains. I\r\ncan run an emu's trail for miles as well as them. They may be good\r\nin Queensland or the plains, but they're no good in the mountains.\"\r\nNevertheless they worried him, as his frequent complaints of their\r\nactivity prove. The district was no doubt a difficult one to track in.\r\nNone but a first-class horseman could ride through it with any degree\r\nof certainty, and no one but an aborigine or a white man born in the\r\ndistrict could cross the ravines and gullies without getting hopelessly\r\n\"bushed,\" without a guide.\r\n\r\nThe arrests and detentions of Kelly's sympathisers continued with\r\nincreased vigour. \"Wild\" Wright and his brother Tom, relatives of the\r\nKellys, Frank Hart, brother of the bushranger, the Lloyds and others,\r\npassed a considerable portion of their time in the cells of the various\r\nlock-ups around the district. Robert Miller was arrested and detained\r\nbecause his daughter, a daring horsewoman, was observed to go into\r\nthe mountains at night with what were supposed to be provisions for\r\nthe bushrangers. She was followed more than once, but contrived to\r\nelude her pursuers by plunging up or down a steep mountain, or across\r\nan almost impassable gully. She never started twice in the same\r\ntrack, sometimes going up one spur or ravine, and next time choosing\r\na different one, and leading even the black trackers astray. The\r\nnewspapers frequently urged the folly of detaining the father while the\r\ndaughter was left free to furnish the outlaws with food and news. The\r\nplain fact is, that when special laws have to be applied, there should\r\nbe no exceptions; otherwise they are valueless. In this case the women\r\nwere far more active and reliable partisans of the Kellys than the men,\r\nand, as there can be little doubt that the Outlawry Act was strained,\r\nto put it mildly, by the police and the local magistracy, with the\r\nconnivance of the Government, another turn of the screw would not have\r\nmade the actions of the authorities any more illegal, and might have\r\nmade them efficient. However, determined as the authorities were to\r\nstamp out lawlessness, they did not carry their own illegal acts to\r\nthis extreme point, and probably this postponed, though it did not\r\nprevent, the end which was inevitable, as it always must be when a few\r\narray themselves against an overwhelming majority.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the name of Aaron Sherritt was first heard\r\nof in connection with the bushrangers. Sherritt was the son of an\r\nex-policeman. He was about twenty-four years of age and had settled in\r\nthe district some time earlier. He selected one hundred and seven acres\r\nof ground on the Woolshed Creek, and the Kellys and Byrnes helped him\r\nto fence it in and clear part of it. He had, however, recently sold\r\nhis farm to a Mr. Crawford, of Melbourne, and had built himself a hut\r\nat Sebastopol, about two miles away, until he could take up another\r\nselection. He was engaged to be married to a sister of Joe Byrnes, and\r\nwas regarded as one of the family. He was suspected of having taken a\r\nshare in some of the extensive horse-stealing raids in company with\r\nthe Kellys and their friends, and had been in consequence an object of\r\npolice suspicion and supervision. This was the man to whom the police\r\nmade advances, and, by promising him the whole of the eight thousand\r\npounds reward offered for the capture of the bushrangers, on condition\r\nthat it should be through his aid and assistance that this capture was\r\neffected, they succeeded in winning him over to their side. He led\r\nSuperintendent Hare and a party of police into the innermost recesses\r\nof the mountains, and pointed out several camps where the bushrangers\r\nhad been; but, in each case, the bushrangers appeared to have received\r\nwarning and to have removed before the police came. Some thought that\r\nSherritt was playing a double game, and that he contrived to let the\r\nbushrangers know when the police might be expected to arrive, but there\r\nappears to be no foundation for this opinion, as it delayed his chance\r\nof obtaining the reward. At first he was careful not to be seen in\r\ncompany with the police, but their association could not be kept secret\r\nfor long, and Sherritt soon became suspected by the Kelly family. One\r\nday Mrs. Byrnes openly accused him of trying to betray her son. There\r\nwas a row, and Sherritt was ordered from the house, his engagement with\r\nthe daughter being broken off. After that Sherritt appeared more openly\r\nin company of the police, parties of whom were constantly watching the\r\nhomes of the four bushrangers on the chance of capturing them should\r\nthey visit their parents or other relatives. Sherritt married the\r\ndaughter of another settler in the district, and all communications\r\nbetween him and the families of the bushrangers were broken off.\r\nSherritt instead of being a friend was considered an enemy of the\r\nbushrangers.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of 1879 and the first half of 1880 nothing of\r\nany importance was heard as to the movements of the bushrangers. More\r\nthan once it was reported that they had left the country, sometimes it\r\nwas said for New Zealand, and at other times for America, but these\r\nreports were invariably contradicted within a few days, and the Kellys\r\nwere said to be still somewhere in the ranges. Sometimes it was said\r\nthat the money stolen from the Jerilderie Bank must be all expended,\r\nand that the Kellys would be forced to leave their hiding-place\r\nshortly, but frequently, during the twelvemonths following that raid,\r\nnothing would be heard of the bushrangers for weeks, and the public\r\nalmost forgot that there was such a gang in existence. Then suddenly\r\ncame the news that the robbers had shot Aaron Sherritt on June 27th,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks a party of police had been secreted, as much as\r\npossible, in Sherritt's house, for the purpose of watching Byrne's\r\nmother's house, and four of them were quietly sitting in the inner\r\nroom at the time of the murder. The particulars of the murder were\r\nas follows:--A German market-gardener named Antoine Weeks was living\r\non the Woolshed Creek, not far from Sherritt's and Byrnes's houses.\r\nHe was walking home on the evening of the day mentioned when he was\r\nmet by Dan Kelly and Joe Byrnes. \"Do you know who we are?\" asked Dan.\r\n\"No,\" replied Weeks. \"Well, we're the Kellys,\" said Dan; \"you do as we\r\ntell you and no harm will come to you.\" They handcuffed the German,\r\nand led him along the road to Sherritt's house. Here Dan told him to\r\nshout \"Aaron.\" Weeks did so, and on Aaron Sherritt coming to the door\r\nto ascertain who wanted him, Byrnes shot him dead without a word. The\r\nbushrangers took the handcuffs off of Weeks and told him to go home.\r\nThen they went to the door of the hut, called Mrs. Sherritt out, and\r\ntold her that she had better send some of the---- traps in her house\r\nout to bury her husband, because \"We've shot him for being a traitor.\"\r\nThe Kellys were fully aware that the police were in the house, and\r\ncalled on them to come out and \"fight like men.\" If the constables\r\nhad come out as invited they would have been courting almost certain\r\ndeath. A bright wood fire was burning in the hut and the front room\r\nwas as bright as day, while all outside was as dark as possible. Had\r\nthe police therefore left the shelter of the inner room and entered\r\nthe front apartment they would have been shot down before they could\r\nhave seen their enemies, whose whereabouts could only have been guessed\r\nat from their shots or from the flash of their revolvers. Going to\r\nthe door under these conditions would have been almost tantamount to\r\ncommitting suicide. The bushrangers raged round the hut calling the\r\npolice the most opprobious names and threatening and taunting them in\r\nhopes of inducing them to come into the light, but as the police kept\r\nquiet and made no reply whatever to their taunts the bushrangers swore\r\nthat they would \"burn 'em like rats in a trap.\" They fired through the\r\nwindows and doors, but they appear to have been just as unwilling to\r\nenter the lighted room as the police were. In fact neither party would\r\ngive the other a chance. The robbers remained round the hut at this\r\nlabour of hate until two a.m., when they departed. At daybreak one of\r\nthe troopers went to where the horses were kept, and rode to Benalla\r\nto give information of the reappearance of the Kellys, while the other\r\nthree followed on the tracks of the outlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n  Fight Between the Police and the Bushrangers at Glenrowan; The\r\n  Railway Torn Up; Attempt to Wreck the Police Train; The Glenrowan Inn\r\n  Besieged; Ned Kelly in Armour; His Capture; The Burning of the Inn;\r\n  Deaths of Dan Kelly, Steve Hart, and Joe Byrnes; Trial and Conviction\r\n  of Ned Kelly; His Death; The Kelly Show; Decrease of Crime in the\r\n  Colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of this fresh outrage was telegraphed to Melbourne,\r\nSub-inspector O'Connor of Queensland, with his six black trackers, with\r\nSuperintendent Hare, Inspector Pewtress, and several other officials\r\nof the Victorian police, a number of newspaper correspondents, and a\r\nfew other favoured persons, started by special train for the scene of\r\ndisorder. Eight troopers were picked up at Benalla, and at twenty-five\r\nminutes past three p.m. the train was stopped near the Glenrowan\r\nplatform by Mr. Curnow, the local schoolmaster, who stood on the line\r\nwaving a red scarf. He informed those on the train that the robbers had\r\ntorn up the rails a short distance ahead, with a view to wrecking the\r\ntrain, and that they were waiting near to shoot the police or any one\r\nelse who might be sent to capture them. A consultation was immediately\r\nheld to decide as to the next step, and while this was going on,\r\nConstable Bracken, the local representative of the police force,\r\narrived and reported that the bushrangers had taken possession of the\r\nGlenrowan Inn, not much more than a hundred yards distant, and that he\r\nhad just made his escape from them.\r\n\r\nThe Glenrowan Inn was built on the Sydney Road, about half-way between\r\nWinton and Wangaratta, shortly after the discovery of gold at the Ovens\r\nRiver, in 1853. The glen was then a camping-place for teams travelling\r\nbetween Melbourne and the diggings. A second hotel was constructed\r\nlater, and a small village, or what the Australians call a township,\r\ngrew up on the little flat at the gap in the hills, locally known as\r\nthe Futter's Range, a spur jutting out from the larger Strathbogie\r\nRange. For some years Glenrowan was quite a flourishing little town,\r\nthe traffic to the diggings being large. But when the Great Northern\r\nRailway was opened in 1873 the village began to dwindle away. The\r\nrailway carried the trade past it to the more conveniently situated\r\nand larger towns on either side, and consequently the population left\r\nfor these towns. The two hotels remained, and there was also a store,\r\na blacksmith's shop, and a few other houses, and these depended for\r\ntheir support on the fruit growers, market gardeners, and farmers who\r\ncultivated the rich alluvial flats with which the lower spurs of the\r\nmountains are interspersed. The railway platform had been constructed\r\nby the Government to accommodate the trade in fruit, vegetables, and\r\nother produce which formed the staple industry of the district in 1880.\r\n\r\nThe Glenrowan Inn was a long, low, weather-board building, with a wide\r\nverandah along the front. It stood some distance back from the road,\r\nwith a large trough hewn from the stem of a tree in front for horses\r\nand bullocks to drink from. Near this was a sign-board with the names\r\nof the hotel and the proprietor on it thus:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n THE GLENROWAN INN\r\n ANN JONES\r\n BEST ACCOMMODATION.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe robbers, it appears, did not go very far when they left Sherritt's\r\nhut. They were aware that, when the news of the murder reached\r\nMelbourne and other centres, an attempt would be made to follow them,\r\nand they seem to have made up their minds to a final effort to conquer\r\nthe police force of the colony. They went to the camp of the line\r\nrepairers and roused them up. James Reardon, on coming out of his hut,\r\nwas ordered to get his tools, as the robbers were determined to rip up\r\nthe line and wreck the train which they expected to arrive. Reardon\r\nat first refused, but on being threatened with death he gave in. He\r\nsaid that the tools were locked up and that he could not get them\r\ntill morning, but he was told that the chest would soon be broken.\r\nHis mate, Sullivan, was also secured, and at length they agreed to do\r\nas they were told. They went to a bend in the road, a short distance\r\nnorth of the platform, being under the impression that the train would\r\narrive from Wangaratta or Beechworth. They ripped up a number of the\r\nrails and piled them across the track. Then they marched Reardon\r\nand his wife and child and Sullivan to the Glenrowan Inn, and took\r\npossession. They collected sixty-two people in the township, including\r\nMr. John Stanistreet, the station-master, and escorted them to the\r\nhotel. Among the prisoners also was Constable Bracken. Ned Kelly walked\r\nabout telling the people that the train would \"soon be here\" from\r\nRushworth with the black trackers and \"a lot of other---- and we're\r\ngoing to kill the lot.\" There was some confusion owing to the fears\r\nof the women and children, and while the bushrangers were engaged in\r\nrestoring order, Constable Bracken contrived to get hold of the key\r\nof the front door. He watched for an opportunity, opened the door and\r\nran out. He reported that three of the troopers who had been hidden\r\nin Sherritt's hut had followed the bushrangers, and had watched all\r\ntheir proceedings, but they had not ventured to attack them, as their\r\nammunition was short, and they were not strong enough. Presently a\r\nman came out on to the verandah, and the police, recognising him as\r\nNed Kelly, fired a volley. Ned laughed, and shouted \"Shoot away, you\r\n----, you can't hurt us.\" At this juncture Mr. Stanistreet came out of\r\nthe house, and walked from the hotel to where the police were, at the\r\nimminent risk of being shot, as he was between the two firing parties.\r\nHe escaped, however, and reported that Miss Jones, aged fourteen, and\r\nseveral other of the prisoners in the hotel had been wounded by the\r\npolice fire, but none of the bushrangers had been hurt. Superintendent\r\nHare had also been severely wounded by the bushrangers, the bullet\r\nhaving shattered the bones of his wrist. He was taken to the railway\r\nstation-master's house and attended to. At about five p.m. Mrs. Jones,\r\nthe landlady of the hotel, appeared on the verandah, wringing her\r\nhands and weeping. She called the police murderers, and said that\r\nher son had been killed and her daughter wounded. The police ceased\r\nfiring, and the boy was brought out. He was still alive, and was sent\r\noff at once to the Wangaratta Hospital, where he died next day. An\r\nold man named Martin Cherry was also said to have been killed. Mrs.\r\nJones and her children and servants, and the men and women who had\r\nbeen made prisoners by the bushrangers, left the hotel after dark\r\nduring a truce, and firing was then kept up during the night. About\r\ndaybreak another party of troopers arrived from Benalla, Wangaratta,\r\nand Beechworth, making the attacking party about thirty strong. There\r\nwas a lull in the firing for a time, while the newly-arrived men were\r\nbeing placed in positions, when suddenly a revolving rifle and a cap\r\nknown to have belonged to Ned Kelly were found a hundred yards from\r\nthe hotel at the rear of the attacking party. The rifle was stained\r\nwith blood. The police were still discussing this find and speculating\r\nhow the articles could have got there when they were fired at from\r\nbehind a tree. The next moment an extraordinary figure marched across\r\nthe space between two trees. The figure looked like a tall, stout\r\nman, with a nail can over his head. Sergeant Steel, Constable Kelly,\r\nand Railway-guard Dowsett fired at it simultaneously, but the bullets\r\nappeared to rebound from the body of the figure. Steel then fired\r\nat the legs, and at the second shot Ned Kelly, for he it was, fell,\r\ncrying out \"I'm done for.\" The police rushed forward, but Kelly raised\r\nhimself on his elbow and fired, howling like a wild beast and declaring\r\nthat they should never take him alive. He continued shooting, but the\r\nbullets \"went wild,\" owing, perhaps, to his weakening through loss of\r\nblood, and he was soon grappled with and handcuffed. The armour worn\r\nby Ned is said to have been made from stolen plough-shares by a local\r\nblacksmith. It consisted of a helmet shaped like a nail can and coming\r\ndown to the shoulders, with a slit in it to enable the wearer to see;\r\nand a breastplate, very long, with shoulder plates and back guard.\r\nThe steel averaged nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness, and the\r\nweight of the suit worn by Ned Kelly was ninety-seven pounds. The\r\nbreastplate showed several dints where it had been struck by bullets,\r\nbut it had not been pierced. Ned had, however, received two wounds in\r\nthe groin, and one each in the left foot, right leg, right hand, and\r\nright arm. He was immediately removed to a safe distance, and placed\r\nunder medical care. Notwithstanding the loss of one of their small\r\nnumber, the bushrangers kept up a brisk fire from the hotel. At one\r\ntime a report was circulated that Joe Byrnes had been shot dead while\r\ndrinking a glass of brandy in the bar, but as there was no apparent\r\nslackening in the fire this was discredited. At three p.m. Constable\r\nCharles Johnson, under cover of a volley from the besiegers, rushed\r\nup to the side of the hotel with a huge bundle of straw, which he\r\nplaced in position and set fire to. The straw blazed up famously, but\r\nsoon died out, and the spectators, of whom there was a goodly number,\r\npronounced the attempt to fire the building a failure. It was at this\r\ntime that Mrs. Skillian, a sister of the Kellys, rode up, dressed\r\nin a well-made black cloth riding habit and a Gainsborough hat. She\r\nadvanced boldly towards the hotel, but was stopped by the police, and\r\nwarned of the danger she was courting. She replied that she was not\r\nafraid, but she desired to persuade her brother Dan to surrender. A\r\nconsultation was held as to whether she should be permitted to try,\r\nbut before a decision was arrived at the flames burst out of the roof\r\nof the building. It may be as well to explain here that the wood of\r\nthe district is principally stringy bark, and that the timber of these\r\ntrees will not burn. It seems probable, therefore, that when the straw\r\nwas ignited against the wall of the building, the calico sheeting, with\r\nwhich the rooms were lined and ceiled, caught fire and burned, while\r\nthe stringy bark weather boards resisted the flames and only charred\r\nthrough slowly. However this may be, the furniture and other fittings\r\nburned fiercely, and the whole building was in a blaze. At this time\r\nthe Rev. Father M. Gibney, a Roman Catholic priest from Perth, Western\r\nAustralia, who was on a visit to the Benalla district at the time,\r\nwalked up to the front door holding his crucifix in his hand. He was\r\nfollowed by a number of the police. When they entered the front door\r\nthey saw the body of Joe Byrnes lying in the bar, in such a position\r\nas to make it probable that the report which had been spread as to his\r\ndeath had been true. The body was dragged out slightly scorched. Dan\r\nKelly and Steve Hart were found dead in a small parlour off the bar.\r\nFrom the position in which they were lying it was conjectured that\r\nthey had either committed suicide or that they had simultaneously shot\r\neach other. But there was no time to decide whether either or which\r\nof these conjectures were true. As Father Gibney was about to stoop\r\ndown to examine the bodies, a gust of wind swept the flames towards\r\nhim and compelled him to retire. The building was thoroughly alight at\r\nlast, and the priest and the police and others who had entered were\r\nforced out by the fierce heat. In a very short time afterwards the\r\nhouse collapsed, and nothing was left but a heap of ashes, the sign\r\npost and trough in front, and the detached kitchen at the rear. In this\r\nkitchen was found old Martin Cherry, severely wounded. He was carried\r\nout and placed under the doctor's care, but died before night. Close\r\nbeside the kitchen was the body of a dog, which had been wounded by the\r\nattacking party and had crawled between the two buildings to die. Some\r\ntime before the attempt to fire the building had been made, a telegram\r\nhad been sent to Melbourne to ask for a small cannon to blow the house\r\ndown with. Now a telegram was sent to say that it was not required.\r\nConsequently the 12-pounder Armstrong gun with the requisite number of\r\nmen of the Garrison Artillery which had been sent off by special train\r\nwere stopped at Seymour and sent back. When the fire had burned down\r\nsufficiently for an examination to be made, the two mounds of ashes\r\nwhich were all that remained of Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were given to\r\nMrs. Skillian for burial, while the body of Joe Byrnes was reserved for\r\nan inquest to be held. Two other suits of armour, similar to that worn\r\nby Ned Kelly, were found, the lightest being ninety-two pounds. During\r\nthe fight \"Wild\" Wright, Tom Wright, Frank Hart, Kate Kelly, several\r\nof the Lloyds and the Byrneses, and other relations and friends of the\r\nbushrangers, had been stationed on a ridge a short distance away to\r\nsee the fun. There was also a large number of other and perhaps more\r\ndisinterested spectators, some of them from Melbourne or Beechworth, or\r\nother even more distant localities. After the inquest the body of Joe\r\nByrnes was given to his friends for burial. Ned Kelly soon recovered\r\nfrom his wounds and was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death\r\nfor the murder of Sergeant Kennedy. In conversations with Inspector\r\nSadlier and other police officials before his trial, he said that\r\nthe bushrangers had known of every movement of the police. They were\r\naware that the police had been hiding in Sherritt's hut for more than\r\na week, hoping to catch Joe if he visited his mother. The police had\r\nno right to stop a man from going to see his mother. When the special\r\ntrain arrived the intention of the bushrangers had been to rake it with\r\nshots as soon as it reached the place where the rails had been removed.\r\n\"But,\" exclaimed Sadlier, \"you would have killed all the people in the\r\ntrain.\" \"Yes, of course, God help them,\" replied Ned, \"they'd have got\r\nshot, but wouldn't they have shot me if they could?\" He said that Steve\r\nHart had visited his mother at Wangaratta, and \"didn't we laugh when we\r\nsaw it in the _Wangaratta News_ afterwards. It was true, too, though\r\nthe police didn't believe it.\" He also said that he had been told\r\nthat after the sticking up of the banks at Euroa and Jerilderie, all\r\nthe branch banks in Victoria sent their receipts to Melbourne almost\r\ndaily. They were not going to stick up any more banks. It wasn't worth\r\nit. What they had intended to do was to stick up a railway train, and\r\nthey'd have done it, \"only those little black devils were always about.\"\r\n\r\nOn November the 5th, a mass meeting was held in the Hippodrome, in\r\nStephen's Street, Melbourne, with Mr. Hamilton, President of the\r\nSociety for the Abolition of Capital Punishment, in the chair. The\r\nprincipal speaker was Mr. David Gaunson, M.L.A., and a resolution was\r\nunanimously carried to the effect that the case of Edward Kelly was\r\na fit one for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy. The\r\n_Melbourne Argus_ said that \"those present belonged to the larrikin\r\nclasses,\" but the attendance was estimated at 4000 persons (including\r\n300 women) inside the building, and about 2000 outside who could not\r\nobtain admittance. Similar meetings were also held in Ballarat,\r\nBendigo, Geelong, and other towns, but these efforts were of no avail,\r\nand Ned Kelly, \"the last of the bushrangers,\" was hung in the Melbourne\r\ngaol, on November 11th, 1880.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days afterwards, a show was opened in Melbourne, with Kate\r\nKelly, one of the sisters of the dead bushrangers, \"mounted on Ned\r\nKelly's celebrated grey mare.\" A suit of the armour used in the last\r\ngreat fight at Glenrowan, several guns, pistols, and revolvers alleged\r\nto have been used in the various raids committed by the bushrangers,\r\nsome handcuffs and other articles which had belonged to, or were\r\nused by them, were exhibited, and some particulars of their careers\r\nwere given in the form of a lecture, but the police authorities soon\r\ninterfered and the show was closed. It was re-opened in Sydney, but was\r\nsuppressed there as \"tending towards immorality\" almost immediately,\r\nand the Kellys returned to the obscurity of private life.\r\n\r\nThus ended the last act in the great tragedy which had supplied almost\r\nthe only feature of romance to Australian history. Bushranging had been\r\nspoken of as \"the national crime of Australia,\" but, as I have shown,\r\nthere was very little bushranging outside the three colonies--New\r\nSouth Wales, Van Diemen's Land, and Victoria. It was rather an\r\nexcrescence on, than a development of, Australian character. It has\r\nbeen estimated that the bushrangers in the colonies from the date\r\nof the great outbreak inaugurated by Frank Gardiner in 1861, to the\r\ndeath of Ned Kelly, with their more active partisans, never exceeded\r\n300 persons, and the story of their exploits shows how even so small\r\na party can disturb a whole country when the rebels are reckless and\r\ndetermined. It may be said in conclusion, that crime has steadily\r\ndecreased in Australia from the cessation of transportation. At first,\r\nwhile the gold fever raged, the improvement was very slight, but from\r\nthe date when the population settled down to steady work the criminal\r\nstatistics, which are very complete in the colonies, show a steady\r\ndiminution in crimes against the person or property. There was an\r\nincrease in the years during which the Ben Hall and Gilbert gang, and\r\ntheir imitators in New South Wales, Victoria and New Zealand, were most\r\nactive, but even this did not materially affect the general result,\r\nand was speedily compensated for after the death of Thunderbolt and the\r\ncapture of Power. In this last epoch of bushranging the Moonlite and\r\nKelly gangs arrested the movement to some degree, but far less sympathy\r\nwas exhibited with them than in the earlier epoch, and their deeds did\r\nnot inspire so many young men with the desire to go and do likewise, as\r\nthose of Hall and Gilbert had done. In fact, bushranging had ceased to\r\nbe popular, so that the retrogression was small in comparison. Since\r\nthen numbers of gaols have been closed or converted to other uses.\r\nThere was a time when every little town in New South Wales had its\r\ngaol. Now many of these gaols have been converted into factories or\r\nstores, or are used for municipal or other purposes. In Victoria the\r\ngaols were fewer but larger, and several of these have been closed,\r\nwhile others once full are now almost empty. A similar story might\r\nbe told of each of the other colonies of the Australasian group, and\r\nAustralia as a whole compares favourably with other civilised countries\r\nin criminal matters. What the Irishman calls \"the bad drop\" in the\r\nblood of the country has been purged away by the most drastic remedies,\r\nand it is extremely improbable that there will ever again be a Frank\r\nGardiner or a Ned Kelly to incite the young and thoughtless to deeds of\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE END._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Allerton, Benjamin, 195, 196\r\n\r\n

The history of the bushrangers is a succession of fierce\r\ncontests and sudden death. To the ordinary man bushranging centres\r\nin the name of Kelly, and the chapters of Mr. Boxall's history which\r\ndescribe the audacities of the two brothers--Dan and Ned--in the\r\nseventies, are perhaps the cream of the book. In the last of the\r\nbushrangers we lost a magnificent soldier; he had the blood of a\r\nthousand terriers, and a certain grim humour too.\"--_Academy._\r\n\r\n\"A very full and detailed history of the origin of bushranging, its\r\ndevelopment, and its gradual decrease.\"--_Bookman._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Boxall's volume about Australian bushrangers is not always\r\nagreeable reading, for it concerns the exploits of some of the most\r\nmurderous and daring ruffians whose names are to be found in the annals\r\nof crime. It is a book, however, from which there is something to be\r\nlearned, for it exemplifies--in a remarkable degree--the maxim that\r\nrough-and-ready methods of suppressing crime are apt to create the very\r\nevils which they are designed to abate.\"--_Daily News._\r\n\r\n\"The author of this deeply-interesting book states in his preface that\r\nhe has compiled it in the hope that it may be of service to future\r\nhistorians of Australia. Quite apart from that, however, it will appeal\r\nstrongly to those who take an interest in the annals of crime and the\r\ndaring of celebrated criminals.\"--_Daily Telegraph._\r\n\r\n\"It is the encyclopædia, history, and analysis of bushranging life,\r\nand could not well be more complete. If his story is as thorough as\r\nan encyclopædia, it is vastly more interesting--as crime and romantic\r\nfacts always are. Uncommonly well done; it amounts to 385 pages of\r\nattractive reading.\"--_Pall Mall Gazette._\r\n\r\n\"We can cordially recommend this book as a sound book of reference\r\nagreeably put together.\"--_British Australasian._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Boxall gives us a solid and impressive, and not a catch-penny nor\r\nsensational, work. He tells us, in strictly matter-of-fact manner, of\r\nthe rise and collapse of bushranging in the various colonies where\r\nit had its brief life--that is in Tasmania, New South Wales, and\r\nVictoria.\"--_Melbourne Argus._",
